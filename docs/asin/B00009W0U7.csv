The film drew me in and the writer did a great job of taking us into this laid back party with about a dozen stoners and some of the more intellectual dialoque was interesting. Yet, the main premise of the movie the serial killings failed. They were yawners. Nothing groundbreaking, not suspenseful, nothing to make you think. As for the end it was just plain st-pid. I wouldn't have paid the 75 cents plus shipping that I did for it if I had known. I would only recommend this film if you happen to come across it on tv and have the time to kill- for atleast it probably won't bore you though it won't necessarily entertain you either.",3,Its just a time killer,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,704,"['film', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'film', 'drew', 'writer', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'laid', 'back', 'party', 'dozen', 'stoners', 'more', 'intellectual', 'dialoque', 'was', 'interesting', 'main', 'premise', 'movie', 'serial', 'killings', 'failed', 'were', 'yawners', 'Nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'nothing', 'make', 'think', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'st-pid', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'paid', '75', 'cents', 'shipping', 'did', 'had', 'known', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'film', 'happen', 'come', 'tv', 'have', 'time', 'kill-', 'atleast', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'entertain']",N/A
758254,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B00009W0U7,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","Non-committal college student Nick wants to do one thing: prove he's smarter than anyone else.  To do that, he decides to stage the perfect mass murder.  See, the differences between mass murderers and serial killers is that serial killers, on occasion, get away with it.  With several examples at hand, including Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, Nick's professor, Hal, insists mass murderers never get away with the deed.  So Nick decides to be the first.  To carry out his plan, he arranges a party in his uncle's luxurious Las Vegas apartment, inviting his closest friends under the guise of a goodbye party for his best friend Jimmy who is about to head off for six months.One by one, throughout the night, Nick manages to, quietly and with no bloodshed, execute his plan and his friends.  Stealing from classics like Hitchcock's ROPE and Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS, Mark Anthony Galluzzo's RSVP is fun to watch despite its flaws.For me, those flaws started with the script which doesn't sound anything at all like how any of the people I have EVER encountered in my life, including the intellectuals, talk, especially when the characters get on a roll concerning the nature of serial killers and man in general.Second is the acting.  Jason Mewes plays Terry, who is basically Jason Mewes under a different name, and he can't even manage to pull off playing himself convincingly.  Glenn Quinn, who spent many many years covering up his Irish accent, keeps slipping in and out of it so often it took me half the movie to realize he was even playing Irish.  I thought he was just having a particularly rough time handling his American accent.And Rick Otto as lead character Nick spent so much time looking like Ethan Hawke's black-haired cousin I was often pulled out of the movie by it.  I know that's not his fault, so I don't hold it against him.  I do, however, hold against him his affinity for overplaying the psycho when no one is watching.  I understand the movie is played for the most part as a black comedy, but let's not shatter the illusion with crazy eyes every single time no one is looking directly at the killer.In addition to Jason Mewes and Glenn Quinn, several other familiar faces show up, adding a certain amount of charm to this low budget movie out of nowhere.  Reno Wilson, Grace Zabriskie and Majandra Delfino all fall victim to Nick's master plan.RSVP is a fun movie despite a number of distracting flaws.  The dialogue really is hard to get past at times, and the acting is, depending on who's front and center, embarrassing, but overall I had a good time watching it.  I think it could have easily been cut by about 15-20 minutes, but that's really neither here nor there and the length certainly doesn't detract from the enjoyment.I like to think there was some point Galluzzo was trying to make with this movie, some statement about fame or something--there was a brief bit delivered by Prof. Evans (Quinn) about how musicians who only go into the business for fame are doing it wrong because he could make himself a household name by morning by simply killing everyone in the room, but the whole things seems to come out of nowhere and felt very out of place in that particular moment in the story--but if he did, I have a feeling he wasn't sure how to include it with any amount of subtlety.RSVP isn't perfect.  In fact, it probably shouldn't even work at all.  But there's something about it I liked anyway, enough to recommend it.  You might even want to watch it a few times just to pick up on some of the foreshadowing that should have been obvious from the start, but only came together in the end.  Overall this is a very flawed, but still very watchable, movie.",4,R.S.V.P.,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,3719,"['Non-committal', 'college', 'student', 'Nick', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'prove', 'smarter', 'anyone', 'else', 'do', 'stage', 'perfect', 'mass', 'murder', 'See', 'differences', 'mass', 'murderers', 'serial', 'killers', 'serial', 'killers', 'occasion', 'get', 'away', 'several', 'examples', 'hand', 'including', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'Nick', 'professor', 'Hal', 'mass', 'murderers', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'deed', 'So', 'Nick', 'be', 'first', 'carry', 'out', 'plan', 'party', 'uncle', 'luxurious', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'apartment', 'inviting', 'closest', 'friends', 'guise', 'goodbye', 'party', 'best', 'friend', 'Jimmy', 'who', 'head', 'off', 'six', 'months.One', 'one', 'night', 'Nick', 'quietly', 'bloodshed', 'execute', 'plan', 'friends', 'Stealing', 'classics', 'Hitchcock', 'ROPE', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'TEN', 'LITTLE', 'INDIANS', 'Mark', 'Anthony', 'Galluzzo', 'RSVP', 'fun', 'watch', 'flaws.For', 'flaws', 'started', 'script', ""n't"", 'sound', 'anything', 'how', 'people', 'have', 'EVER', 'encountered', 'life', 'including', 'intellectuals', 'talk', 'especially', 'when', 'characters', 'get', 'roll', 'concerning', 'nature', 'serial', 'killers', 'man', 'general.Second', 'acting', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Terry', 'who', 'basically', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'different', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'playing', 'convincingly', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'who', 'spent', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'covering', 'up', 'Irish', 'accent', 'slipping', 'so', 'often', 'took', 'movie', 'realize', 'was', 'even', 'playing', 'Irish', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'having', 'particularly', 'rough', 'time', 'handling', 'American', 'accent.And', 'Rick', 'Otto', 'lead', 'character', 'Nick', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'looking', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'black-haired', 'cousin', 'was', 'often', 'pulled', 'out', 'movie', 'know', 'not', 'fault', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'do', 'however', 'hold', 'affinity', 'overplaying', 'psycho', 'when', 'one', 'watching', 'understand', 'movie', 'played', 'most', 'part', 'black', 'comedy', 'let', 'not', 'shatter', 'illusion', 'crazy', 'eyes', 'single', 'time', 'one', 'looking', 'directly', 'killer.In', 'addition', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'several', 'other', 'familiar', 'show', 'up', 'adding', 'certain', 'amount', 'charm', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'Reno', 'Wilson', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', 'Majandra', 'Delfino', 'fall', 'victim', 'Nick', 'master', 'plan.RSVP', 'fun', 'movie', 'number', 'distracting', 'flaws', 'dialogue', 'really', 'hard', 'get', 'past', 'times', 'acting', 'depending', 'who', 'front', 'center', 'embarrassing', 'overall', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'cut', '15-20', 'minutes', 'really', 'here', 'there', 'length', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'detract', 'enjoyment.I', 'think', 'was', 'point', 'Galluzzo', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'movie', 'statement', 'fame', 'something', 'was', 'brief', 'bit', 'delivered', 'Prof.', 'Evans', 'Quinn', 'how', 'musicians', 'who', 'only', 'go', 'business', 'fame', 'are', 'doing', 'wrong', 'could', 'make', 'household', 'name', 'morning', 'simply', 'killing', 'everyone', 'room', 'whole', 'things', 'come', 'nowhere', 'felt', 'very', 'place', 'particular', 'moment', 'story', 'did', 'have', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'include', 'amount', 'subtlety.RSVP', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'fact', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'work', 'something', 'liked', 'anyway', 'enough', 'recommend', 'might', 'even', 'want', 'watch', 'few', 'times', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'foreshadowing', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'start', 'only', 'came', 'together', 'end', 'Overall', 'very', 'flawed', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'movie']",N/A

What transpires is your typical degenerate young people's generation's version of a party including plenty of drug use, terrible music and your run-of-the-mill pathetic fight sequence over the topic of murder.  Neither do Nick's friends know, Nick has an ulterior Raskolnikovian motive that may not be to their collective liking.In all fairness, ""R.S.V.P."" does not attempt to take itself too seriously because of its own self-awareness of its obvious limitations, but this tongue-in-cheek attitude is simply NOT an excuse for this movie's lameness as the creators of this flick attempt to pass off this stupid attempt at humor as its own pathetic horror disclaimer.  That being said, the plot of ""R.S.V.P."" does not sound bad in and of itself, but the plot execution is awful and cannot be taken seriously.  Thus, no one could possibly take this movie or any of its characters seriously, and this severely hinders the movie's effectiveness as a horror movie; but, alas, this movie was a zero from its inception.  Indeed, the audience simply cannot sympathize with these stupid and oversimplified generic zeroes of characters due to overall bad acting and the cinematic direction involved.  In fact, there is not one character in this entire movie that is even remotely likeable, so no one really cares what happens to them or do we?As the characters are knocked off one at a time in ridiculously unconvincing fashion, I would argue that the viewer becomes pleased (for more reasons that one) that the characters are being killed, and then it occurs to the reasonably intellectually sound viewer that the pathetic fact of the matter is that this movie would actually be better if Jason Voorhees burst through the door with a machete and cut every character's head off simultaneously with one vicious blow ending the movie instantly and saving us our time of having to sit through 1:45 of this STEAMING PILE called ""R.S.V.P.""!!!!  Awwwwwe, that would have made a much better movie indeed...need I say more?In short, ""R.S.V.P."" is an incredibly lame excuse for a horror movie.

758260,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00009W0U7,trebe,"[0, 0]","Written, produced, directed, and shot, by Mark Anthony Galluzzo, R.S.V.P. (2002) is a surreal suspense thriller that plays with its audience, as to prove a point, a deranged man decides to murder some friends that he has invited to a party at a penthouse suite, at the top of the Fremont Hotel in Las Vegas.  While the film doesn't have a story that makes much sense, and many of the characters aren't really likable, it does feature some mean and nasty kills, which are probably the primary points of interest.  Spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.College instructor Hal Davis (Glenn Quinn) espouses his belief that when it comes to murder, it is style that matters, not a high body count.  Nick Collier (Rick Otto), one of Davis' students, believes that committing a successful mass murder is the ultimate challenge, and decides to put this theory to the test, while also taking revenge on his ex-girlfriend Jordan (Brandi Andres), as she and a group of his friends, drop by for a party at his uncle's place.In between drinking, bong hits, dancing, flirting, and playing Twister, Collier mixes in a little murder, as he begins to eliminate his guests, although not always doing the greatest job of hiding the bodies.  When Callie (Mejandra Delfino) a neighbor unexpectedly stops by, Jimmy makes a quick adjustment, and continues with his plan, which includes some cool kills.  Eventually there are just a few left alive, and Collier comes out into the open to confront Jordan, and Davis his learned instructor.  One big reveal is that Franklin's first victim was the man who replaced him in Jordan's affections, and in a salute to Hitchcock's Rope, his corpse has been hidden in plain view, inside a piece of furniture.Although the motivation for the killings isn't very realistic, the movie does deliver a high body count.  With a certain callous style, the film tries hard to come across as funny and clever, but it probably falls short of its aspirations.  Things ultimately fall apart when Collier, who has been a pretty efficient killer, becomes an overdramatic babbler, who can't hit anything at point blank range with his gun.The film finishes with a flurry of violence, and scores points for the unpredictability and viciousness of some of the kills.  Scenes on the roof of the Fremont Hotel, in the middle of downtown Las Vegas, are interesting, although why Boyd Gaming approved the filming of a movie featuring a mass murderer in the penthouse is a mystery.
