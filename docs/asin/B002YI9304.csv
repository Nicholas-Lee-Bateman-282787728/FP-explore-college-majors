1299162,A2M3NO8VMO7P0U,B002YI9304,A. Beck,"[6, 7]","When I heard they were making a sequel to 'Cabin Fever', I immediately brushed it off.  First off, Eli Roth would not be returning as the director...although, not necessarily a bad thing.  But the fact that new director Ti West had completely disowned the film and it was going to be released straight to DVD, I knew this had to be a total suckfest.  But boy was I wrong.The film starts up basically where the first one left off.  Paul (played by Rider Strong) makes his way through the woods, leaving behind a trail of loose flesh with every tree branch that he brushes up against.  If you haven't seen the first film, it's basically about a group of teenagers who comes in contact with a deadly flesh eating virus.  In this film we find out that the culprit is a local bottling plant in town called ""Down Home Water""...and unfortunately they just so happen to supply bottled water to the local high school.Rider Strong's character quickly meets his demise via the front end of a speeding school bus and this leads us into the next chapter of the 'Cabin Fever' saga...A new group of kids, same deadly virus.  A majority of this film takes place around a high school prom where the teens not only try to survive the deadly outbreak, but they also have to contend with a contamination squad who shows up looking to use deadly force as a way to contain the virus.Overall I enjoyed this film much more than I did the original and it surprises me, having now watched it, that Ti West had such an issue with the end result.  The thing that I liked the most about the movie was the overall tone.  Even though the movie is filled with gallons, upon gallons of the ""red stuff"", which is sure to gross out most movie goers, the dialog and acting is presented in a rather campy way which makes it so much fun to watch.  You can tell that the actors really had a blast with the roles they are given because it certainly comes across that way on screen.  There's also some really great cameo appearances with comedian Judah Friedlander and also Mark Borchardt of 'American Movie' fame who shows up playing Giuseppe Andrews' heavy metal listenin' cousin Herman.The makeup effects by Quantum Creation's are surely the main selling point of this feature.  Like I said before, there's tons of gore in this film...Before the movie is over we see blood splattered throughout the entire school practically.  Some of the more memorable bits for me include Paul getting hit by the school bus in the beginning of the film and also a local townie who succumbs to the virus while eating pancakes at a local diner.  There's so much stuff going on though that it's hard to pick out a favorite really.  Gorehounds certainly won't be disappointed.'Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever' was released by Lions Gate Home Entertainment on February 16th, 2010 and fans of the original will definitely want to give this one a watch.  Even though most of the reviews I see regarding the film have been negative, I can't help but to call B.S. on all of them.  Other than the less than stellar ending, I found this movie to be highly enjoyable and definitely worth checking out.3.5 out of 5 starsRecommended",4,"Great sequel, terrible ending...",1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,3161,"['When', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'sequel', ""'Cabin"", 'Fever', 'immediately', 'brushed', 'off', 'First', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'director', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'fact', 'new', 'director', 'Ti', 'West', 'had', 'completely', 'disowned', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'straight', 'DVD', 'knew', 'had', 'be', 'total', 'suckfest', 'boy', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'film', 'up', 'basically', 'where', 'first', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'Paul', 'played', 'Rider', 'Strong', 'way', 'woods', 'leaving', 'trail', 'loose', 'flesh', 'tree', 'branch', 'up', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'film', 'basically', 'group', 'teenagers', 'who', 'contact', 'deadly', 'flesh', 'eating', 'virus', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'culprit', 'local', 'bottling', 'plant', 'town', 'called', 'Down', 'Home', 'Water', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'so', 'happen', 'supply', 'bottled', 'water', 'local', 'high', 'school.Rider', 'Strong', 'character', 'quickly', 'demise', 'front', 'end', 'speeding', 'school', 'bus', 'next', 'chapter', ""'Cabin"", 'Fever', 'saga', 'A', 'new', 'group', 'kids', 'same', 'deadly', 'virus', 'majority', 'film', 'place', 'high', 'school', 'prom', 'where', 'teens', 'not', 'only', 'try', 'survive', 'deadly', 'outbreak', 'also', 'have', 'contend', 'contamination', 'squad', 'who', 'up', 'looking', 'use', 'deadly', 'force', 'way', 'contain', 'virus.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'original', 'having', 'now', 'watched', 'Ti', 'West', 'had', 'such', 'issue', 'end', 'result', 'thing', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'overall', 'tone', 'Even', 'movie', 'filled', 'gallons', 'gallons', 'red', 'stuff', 'sure', 'gross', 'out', 'most', 'movie', 'goers', 'dialog', 'acting', 'presented', 'rather', 'campy', 'way', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'can', 'tell', 'actors', 'really', 'had', 'blast', 'roles', 'are', 'given', 'certainly', 'way', 'screen', 'also', 'really', 'great', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'comedian', 'Judah', 'Friedlander', 'also', 'Mark', 'Borchardt', ""'American"", 'Movie', 'fame', 'who', 'up', 'playing', 'Giuseppe', 'Andrews', 'heavy', 'metal', 'listenin', 'cousin', 'Herman.The', 'makeup', 'effects', 'Quantum', 'Creation', 'are', 'surely', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'feature', 'said', 'tons', 'gore', 'film', 'movie', 'see', 'blood', 'splattered', 'entire', 'school', 'practically', 'more', 'memorable', 'bits', 'include', 'Paul', 'getting', 'hit', 'school', 'bus', 'beginning', 'film', 'also', 'local', 'townie', 'who', 'virus', 'eating', 'pancakes', 'local', 'diner', 'so', 'much', 'stuff', 'going', 'hard', 'pick', 'out', 'favorite', 'really', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', ""'Cabin"", 'Fever', '2', 'Spring', 'Fever', 'was', 'released', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'February', '16th', '2010', 'fans', 'original', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'watch', 'Even', 'most', 'reviews', 'see', 'regarding', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'negative', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'call', 'B.S', 'Other', 'less', 'stellar', 'ending', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', '5', 'starsRecommended']",Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever
1299163,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B002YI9304,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","It's never a good sign when a director attempts to distance himself from a film. Such is the case with the sequel to Eli Roth's gross-out opus, ""Cabin Fever."" Director Ti West tried and failed to remove his name from the final product that is ""Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever"" and it's easy to see why. The film is as messy and ridiculous as it is uneven and patched together. That's not say that some enjoyment can't be milked from this unnecessarily but entertaining sequel, though. If you are of the variety who enjoys cheesy splatter flicks with a heavy dosage of gross-out humor, this might just be up your alley.Picking up where the first film left off, the virus has now spread from a cabin to a high school prom where teenagers are unknowingly knocking back tainted punch. Before long, the school is quarantined and its up to a couple of misfits to get out and warn the rest of the world. Needless to say, things get nasty rather quickly.Aside from returning actors Giuseppe Andrews and Rider Strong, ""Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever"" features an all-new cast. Andrews is thankfully given a larger role than in the first and is the saving grace of the film. He's as hilarious and off-beat as ever and is probably the best connection this movie has to its predecessor. Strong has a decidedly smaller role, however. Without giving too much away, his part is minor at best (certainly not worthy of the top-billing he receives on the film) but he was probably just happy to get work. Afterall, the residuals from ""Boy Meets World"" re-runs ain't gonna pay the bills. The rest of the cast is competent if forgettable, with a few in particular looking and sounding as if they stepped off the set of a Rob Zombie film. Judah Friedlander of ""30 Rock"" fame has a fleeting cameo, but it's really the cast of mis-matched teenagers (see: 20-30 year olds) who are left to carry the film. In spite of their lack of charisma, they certainly add some color where the film needs it.The narrative at hand isn't particularly inventive, but is a nice throwback to 80's teen splatter flicks that would likely make Roth proud. It's a shame though that the film is so uneven and comes unraveled towards the end. Director Ti West was left out of the cutting room and it shows. While it serves its purpose as a campy homage to Roth's original and the genre itself, the film can't help but succumb to its own short-comings. Just as it gets good it ends abruptly, leaving many questions looming over the viewer's head. Perhaps someday West's cut will surface, but in the meantime, warts and all, ""Cabin Fever 2"" is an acceptable if tough-to-love follow-up. Recommended for those horror fans with a sense of humor and an appreciation for b-movie slop and absolutely nobody else.",3,"A few pancakes short of a stack, but good syrupy fun nevertheless.",1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,2749,"['never', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'director', 'distance', 'film', 'Such', 'case', 'sequel', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'gross-out', 'opus', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'Director', 'Ti', 'West', 'tried', 'failed', 'remove', 'name', 'final', 'product', 'Cabin', 'Fever', '2', 'Spring', 'Fever', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'messy', 'ridiculous', 'uneven', 'patched', 'together', 'not', 'say', 'enjoyment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'milked', 'unnecessarily', 'entertaining', 'sequel', 'though', 'are', 'variety', 'who', 'cheesy', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'heavy', 'dosage', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'up', 'alley.Picking', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'film', 'left', 'off', 'virus', 'now', 'spread', 'cabin', 'high', 'school', 'prom', 'where', 'teenagers', 'are', 'unknowingly', 'knocking', 'back', 'tainted', 'punch', 'long', 'school', 'quarantined', 'up', 'couple', 'misfits', 'get', 'out', 'warn', 'rest', 'world', 'Needless', 'say', 'things', 'get', 'nasty', 'rather', 'quickly.Aside', 'returning', 'actors', 'Giuseppe', 'Andrews', 'Rider', 'Strong', 'Cabin', 'Fever', '2', 'Spring', 'Fever', 'all-new', 'cast', 'Andrews', 'thankfully', 'given', 'larger', 'role', 'first', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'as', 'hilarious', 'off-beat', 'ever', 'probably', 'best', 'connection', 'movie', 'predecessor', 'Strong', 'decidedly', 'smaller', 'role', 'however', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'part', 'minor', 'best', 'certainly', 'not', 'worthy', 'top-billing', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'happy', 'get', 'work', 'Afterall', 'residuals', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 're-runs', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'pay', 'bills', 'rest', 'cast', 'competent', 'forgettable', 'few', 'particular', 'looking', 'sounding', 'stepped', 'off', 'set', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'film', 'Judah', 'Friedlander', '30', 'Rock', 'fame', 'fleeting', 'cameo', 'really', 'cast', 'mis-matched', 'teenagers', 'see', '20-30', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'carry', 'film', 'spite', 'lack', 'charisma', 'certainly', 'add', 'color', 'where', 'film', 'it.The', 'narrative', 'hand', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'inventive', 'nice', 'throwback', '80', 'teen', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'would', 'likely', 'make', 'Roth', 'proud', 'shame', 'film', 'so', 'uneven', 'unraveled', 'towards', 'end', 'Director', 'Ti', 'West', 'was', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'purpose', 'campy', 'homage', 'Roth', 'original', 'genre', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'succumb', 'own', 'short-comings', 'Just', 'good', 'abruptly', 'leaving', 'many', 'questions', 'looming', 'viewer', 'head', 'Perhaps', 'someday', 'West', 'cut', 'will', 'surface', 'meantime', 'warts', 'Cabin', 'Fever', '2', 'acceptable', 'tough-to-love', 'follow-up', 'Recommended', 'horror', 'fans', 'sense', 'humor', 'appreciation', 'b-movie', 'slop', 'absolutely', 'nobody', 'else']",Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever

Students at the local high school are in for a big surprise when the flesh-eating virus from the previous film finds its way into the prom care of a case of infected spring water. Though the teen-edgy script is wholly idiotic, it is equally entertaining with its low-brow humor and gooey gross-outs. Even the stock characters and empty plotting are outweighed by the exploding bodies, projectile vomit, bloody water sports, and countless other repulsive gags.

We've got kids projectile vomiting on each other all over the place - we don' need no stinkin' story, amigo!OK, I have to admit there is actually a story - not much of one, but a story nonetheless.  Cabin Fever 2 basically takes place immediately following the events of the first movie.  By this point, the contamination has spread to the water supply, and the local bottling company's first shipment of contaminated water goes to the high school - on the day of the prom, no less.  That does not bode well for the obligatory party punch, which all the kids will be drinking (actually, thanks to the 12-year-old mentality of the filmmakers, there's an even more disgusting ingredient than the flesh-eating virus that finds its way into the punch).  I guess we're supposed to care about the three main characters, but I will leave that option entirely up to each individual viewer.To sum up, I hated every single thing about this movie.  It's an insult to the viewer's intelligence; it's offensive in the way it shamelessly ridicules the outcasts of high school society; its pitiful attempts at humor (mostly juvenile) fail completely; and it relies entirely too much on blood and gore for its appeal to viewers.  I'm sorry, but you just can't cover up plot holes with repetitive scenes of teenagers projectile vomiting on each other.  Let's just hope and pray that no one ever releases a third entry in this wretched Cabin Fever series.",1,Embarrassingly awful in every way possible,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,3127,"['How', 'can', 'possibly', 'put', 'words', 'just', 'how', 'ungodly', 'awful', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'bad', 'originalCabin', 'Fever', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'director', 'Ti', 'West', 'Roth', 'look', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'amateurish', 'effort', 'Actually', 'out', 'West', 'tried', 'get', 'name', 'removed', 'credits', 'film', 'basically', 'claim', 'part', 'film', 'own', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'guy', 'Cabin', 'Fever', '2', 'Spring', 'Fever', 'kind', 'film', 'could', 'probably', 'should', 'ruin', 'careers', 'everyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'associated', 'just', 'one', 'humongous', 'steaming', 'pile', 'cinematic', 'cow', 'patty', 'here.So', 'just', 'how', 'take', 'one', 'horror', 'genre', 'most', 'disappointing', 'overrated', 'movies', 'actually', 'fall', 'new', 'lows', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'turn', 'whole', 'production', 'lamest', 'high', 'school', 'horror', 'comedy', 'time', 'top', 'off', 'copious', 'amounts', 'projectile', 'vomiting', 'doofus', 'cop', 'first', 'film', 'Make', 'sure', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'one', 'Feel', 'free', 'course', 'rip', 'off', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'asCarrie', 'Special', 'Edition', 'whenever', 'feel', 'Let', 'exploit', 'teenager', 'clich', 'eacute', 'book', ""'re"", 'make', 'sure', 'overweight', 'young', 'lady', 'can', 'openly', 'ridicule', 'Hey', 'cameraman', 'let', 'do', 'weird', 'angle', 'shots', 'especially', 'ridiculous-looking', 'teacher', 'beehive', 'hairdo', 'kids', 'just', 'go', 'crazy', 'weird', 'camera', 'angles', 'Oh', 'oh', 'oh', 'Heeheehee', 'Let', 'animate', 'opening', 'credits', 'ending', 'sequence', ""'ll"", 'really', 'mess', 'viewers', 'puny', 'little', 'minds', 'decent', 'story', 'What', 'are', 'smoking', ""'ve"", 'got', 'kids', 'vomiting', 'other', 'place', 'don', 'need', 'stinkin', 'story', 'amigo', 'OK', 'have', 'admit', 'actually', 'story', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'story', 'nonetheless', 'Cabin', 'Fever', '2', 'basically', 'place', 'immediately', 'following', 'events', 'first', 'movie', 'point', 'contamination', 'spread', 'water', 'supply', 'local', 'bottling', 'company', 'first', 'shipment', 'contaminated', 'water', 'high', 'school', 'day', 'prom', 'less', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'obligatory', 'party', 'punch', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'drinking', 'actually', 'thanks', '12-year-old', 'mentality', 'filmmakers', 'even', 'more', 'disgusting', 'ingredient', 'flesh-eating', 'virus', 'way', 'punch', 'guess', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'care', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'will', 'leave', 'option', 'entirely', 'individual', 'viewer.To', 'sum', 'hated', 'single', 'thing', 'movie', 'insult', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'offensive', 'way', 'shamelessly', 'outcasts', 'high', 'school', 'society', 'pitiful', 'attempts', 'humor', 'mostly', 'juvenile', 'fail', 'completely', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'blood', 'gore', 'appeal', 'viewers', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cover', 'up', 'plot', 'holes', 'repetitive', 'scenes', 'teenagers', 'projectile', 'vomiting', 'other', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'pray', 'one', 'ever', 'third', 'entry', 'wretched', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'series']",Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever

I enjoyed the characters and the writing, strong high school interacting reminding me a bit of ""Heathers"", though not near that caliber. Noah Segan was a great leading man as John, the only thing I remember his from was as the ""twink"" in ""Adam & Steve"" and he was quite scene-stealing in that brief appearance!Besides missing the cabin, or as I envisoned from the cover art I thought maybe a bus would break down in the woods at least! But that was ""Jeeper Creepers 2""! Okay I missed the slow skin-devestation from the first movie. These guys just started vomiting blood too fast, and for many that was it! Vomit, then dead! None of the tension of discovery that took place in the first Cabin. But of course you couldn't actually do that in a prom movie. Anyone slowly discovering lesions whilst getting dressed for or arriving at the prom would flee immediately to a doctor!So the epidemic becomes rather rushed in this one. I actually can't remember how it ended now all of a sudden, and it was just last night! I guess that speaks for the ending. Last night while watching I wondered if I'd keep this or re-sell it, esp. since my horror dvds have grown beyond the boundries of the shelves I have them in. I think I will for now. maybe instead I should figure out how to pawn off that awful ""Bottom Feeder"" I watched the other night!Oh, Rider Strong gets top billing?

CABIN FEVER 2 is not a good sequel to the original film as it strays way too far from the things that made the original work so well.  Setting the film in a high school was the wrong idea from the start, but the film did manage to have a lot of fun going for it.  It even managed to ""get me"" once with a scene involving a head hitting the side of a swimming pool and there are plenty of fairly revolting gross out sequences.  There are also some major laughs in this movie and it does manage to convey the strange offbeat nature of the first film fairly well.Deputy Winston is back and his character provides some of the best moments in the film.  This time he is joined with his cousin, Herman, played by Mark Borchardt of COVEN fame.  The two are great together.  Somehow Rider Strong gets top billing in this thing and that is very deceptive.  He is onscreen for perhaps 45 seconds and is in makeup that entirely obscures his face.  Anyone could have played the role in this makeup.  He has no lines and simply gets up out of the water and runs to the road where he is immediately run over by a school bus.  This is even before the (bad) opening title credits.  Speaking of the credits, they are animated and the tone is way off.  The end sequence is likewise animated and it is truly a stupid choice.  In spite of the flaws in this film (one of which is the cast, most of whom are rather unattractive) I really enjoyed the first 70 minutes or so but the ending (or complete lack of one) really brings this film down.  Clearly this was a movie that was building toward something and I believe the director had a clear vision in mind of where all this was heading.  Sadly, nothing gets resolved.  The film simply stops with no sort of climax or resolution to anything.  It seems like an unfinished film. Director Ti West has went on the record to disown this version of the film and correctly so.  It is apparent that something seriously wrong happend here.  It isn't good enough on its own merits to justify a directors cut of the film so this mess is what we will have to live with.  Frankly, I hope there are no more CABIN FEVER films.  The first one is a classic and if this is what the producers are going to do with the sequels then I would rather not see any more.  It isn't an awful movie, has fun and grotesque moments, but the butcherd cut of the film LionsGate has released is a real disapointment.",3,"Decent sequel with a terrible ""ending""",1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,2541,"['What', 'went', 'wrong', 'here', 'Why', 'film', 'just', 'stop', 'instead', 'reaching', 'conclusion', 'sort', 'What', 'happened', 'ending', 'CABIN', 'FEVER', '2', 'not', 'good', 'sequel', 'original', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'things', 'made', 'original', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Setting', 'film', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'wrong', 'idea', 'start', 'film', 'did', 'manage', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'going', 'even', 'managed', 'get', 'once', 'scene', 'involving', 'head', 'hitting', 'side', 'swimming', 'pool', 'are', 'plenty', 'fairly', 'revolting', 'gross', 'out', 'sequences', 'are', 'also', 'major', 'laughs', 'movie', 'manage', 'convey', 'strange', 'offbeat', 'nature', 'first', 'film', 'fairly', 'well.Deputy', 'Winston', 'back', 'character', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'time', 'joined', 'cousin', 'Herman', 'played', 'Mark', 'Borchardt', 'COVEN', 'fame', 'two', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'Somehow', 'Rider', 'Strong', 'top', 'billing', 'thing', 'very', 'deceptive', 'onscreen', 'perhaps', '45', 'seconds', 'makeup', 'entirely', 'face', 'Anyone', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'makeup', 'lines', 'simply', 'up', 'water', 'road', 'where', 'immediately', 'run', 'over', 'school', 'bus', 'even', 'bad', 'opening', 'title', 'credits', 'Speaking', 'credits', 'are', 'animated', 'tone', 'way', 'end', 'sequence', 'likewise', 'animated', 'truly', 'stupid', 'choice', 'spite', 'flaws', 'film', 'one', 'cast', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'rather', 'unattractive', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', '70', 'minutes', 'so', 'ending', 'complete', 'lack', 'one', 'really', 'film', 'down', 'Clearly', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'building', 'something', 'believe', 'director', 'had', 'clear', 'vision', 'mind', 'where', 'was', 'heading', 'Sadly', 'nothing', 'resolved', 'film', 'simply', 'sort', 'climax', 'resolution', 'anything', 'unfinished', 'film', 'Director', 'Ti', 'West', 'went', 'record', 'disown', 'version', 'film', 'correctly', 'so', 'apparent', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'happend', 'here', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'own', 'merits', 'justify', 'directors', 'cut', 'film', 'so', 'mess', 'what', 'will', 'have', 'live', 'Frankly', 'hope', 'are', 'more', 'CABIN', 'FEVER', 'films', 'first', 'one', 'classic', 'what', 'producers', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'sequels', 'then', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'see', 'more', ""n't"", 'awful', 'movie', 'fun', 'grotesque', 'moments', 'butcherd', 'cut', 'film', 'LionsGate', 'released', 'real', 'disapointment']",Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever

1299189,A2HSFKLLQHYY6S,B002YI9304,Matt Skidmore,"[1, 3]","Wow! This is a bad movie. Directed by the usually talented Ti West (who fares a little better with his other horror movie of the month 'House of the Devil'), this follow up to the Eli Roth original is a useless waste of time with unlikable characters, a badly developed script and sub par acting and production values across the board.The story (as is the norm with films of this kind - ie, the dumped direct to video kind) is very lazy and is content to simply rehash and pump out a dull story that neither expands on the original concept or surpass it. After an amusing prologue which ties up events from the first flick, the film nose dives at about the two minute mark in, where the 'actual' story begins. Focusing on the character of John (played by Noah Regan, who starts off as the hero, then descends into ranting lunatic) who decides to join the girl of his dreams Cassie and his best friend (Rusty Kelly as the supposed comic relief, but comes off as just annoying) at their high school prom. Following the usual teen hi jinks - including a stand off with Cassie's jealous boy friend (who sports one of those weird 70s hair do's that you never get used to), drinking, playing pranks on each other and vulgar sex scenes - the producers seem to remember what we paid for and offer an almost throw away story about the disease (you know, from the first movie!) - popping out the old ''infected bottled water'' scenario, which for some reason everybody in this movie seems to drink. Therefore, nearly everybody in the movie becomes infected and the usual blood spurting, vomit spewing and skin scratching shenanigans begin.They do try to throw in nods to the original, such as returning Giuseppe Andrews as the dope head deputy but even his amusing asides do nothing to help this travesty. Granted, the original movie wasn't exactly high art, but this sequel is so dull and uninspired, that it makes its predecessor resemble 'Citizen Kane' (well, maybe 'Neon Maniacs' in reality, but you get the picture) - no wonder director Ti West wanted his name of the finished article. Mind you, why it took him and two other writers to come up with this dross is probably the most terrifying thing about this whole endeavor.The picture quality is pretty good and to be fair, does have the same stylistic 'look' that the original had. The direction is pretty dull and the story is lacklustre - and, at no point do you either care or connect to anyone in the film. Its one of those kind of flicks - a hamburger of a film, which you don't really enjoy whilst you are eating it and become real hungry, real quick when you have finished. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much but its always nice to be proved wrong. Pity this one didn't even bother. I won't even start on the animated opening and closing bookends, you will know yourself when you see it.

The last of the mutated survivors from the first movie gets hit by a car, exploding in a blood-bag spatter into the town's water supply. I'm a sucker for animated montages, and Cabin Fever 2's introductory cartoon, accompanied by a grim folk song, sets the right tone for a town about to get very, very sick.The acting is surprisingly good for a movie about a blood-vomiting infection. It centers on the town's prom, and to the writers' credit he takes time to explore each character's hopes, dreams, and petty grievances before making them puke their brains out.Nothing is sacred in Cabin Fever 2 and no orifice is off limits.  Blood ends up everywhere in the most awful circumstances imaginable, and for those who enjoy that sort of thing Cabin Fever 2 delivers in buckets. It also borrows a plot device used in Quarantine - the men in biohazard suits that show up to contain the infection are worse than the infection itself.Unfortunately, once the prom is over Cabin Fever 2 runs out of bloody steam.  There's an extraneous clip of a stripper who missed the prom infecting other people, another unnecessary animated montage, and a feeling that the ruthless moviemaking apparatus that churns out grad z horror movie sequels will not be denied.

Instead, what we get here instead is a film that feels as if it's half-finished, and for all rights and purposes, it is.  Ti West helms the film, which picks up shortly after the events of the first film, with that same flesh eating virus wrecking havoc upon high school kids at prom.  Where the film shines is surprisingly with these high school/teen conventions, which West manages to handle with actual care, just as he did with his excellent recent film The House of the Devil.  And oh yeah, there is a heaping amount of gore and sick gross out moments to be had as well.  If you're a gorehound, you'll be happy with what all you find here.  Where the film fails however is thanks to its ending, or rather lack there of.  West had many disagreements with the producers, leading to an ending that truly has been assembled without the man's approval.  Still though, there's enough here to recommend Cabin Fever 2 if you have the stomach for it: the animated segments are nicely done, there's a great soundtrack, Giuseppe Andrews returns as the party loving cop Winston (as does Rider Strong in an incredibly brief, but oh so memorable, turn of events in the film's opening), and as said before, there is a heaping amount of gore and just plain disgusting moments.

It just picks up and goes, with no background and completely makes fun of itself along the way.""This Is Evil Dead II Fueled By Teenage Hormones!""  ... Is possibly the worst comparison in the world. Only thing remotely close in comparison is the fact the lead character... or teenager, takes his arm off, yes arm, to the elbow. Although the next seen he's just missing his hand?I know, im sure there was some sort of budget. And I was wrong for going into this hoping for something great. I give up hope on Direct-To-DVD films. Seems like no one is even trying anymore. This film for example, they had a great plot, awesome potential of a story, even returning cast from the first (Which was great and original)... Seemed the film was more focused on a ""Gross"" factor. Thats not a selling point, lets move on.Rider Strong... well, I think he did great in the first one. My hopes of having some focal point with his characters awakening, were literally smashed with a bus in the first 2 minutes. So why is he mentioned as leading role? Why did you come back to this horrible sequel, Rider!?? The effects were great, but why? Anywho... moving on.As I mentioned with the bus scene, the effects are pretty good in the film, definately credit due. No complaint, except as to why they really needed a scene with the kid and his infected junk spitting. Theres a difference between good gore and over-doing it. That was it.The acting was surprisingly decent, and it was great seeing the main character lose it and scream at the girl he loves. That scene was well worth the watch, who hasnt wanted to blow up and say everything on their mind like that at some point?As for the story, so much potential and so much left undone. Why didnt we put more effort here??? My biggest complaint, who are the guys in the suits? Im sure its some sort of government team sent in to clean up, but why no details? Another thing, what happened to the main character? He gets taken away and BAM, next scene. First film did it right, you were attatched to the lead characters, then they were taken away and you hated it. This film, when the characters are taken away, all I felt was... oh well.I dont want to steer people away from this film, because I loved the idea of a sequel, and even the scenario. It just could have been better. I recommend a rental, but its not worth the $16.99 as listed. Maybe $9. If for some horrible reason you guys ever make a third installment...

1299199,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002YI9304,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever (Ti West, 2009)Those who are familiar with Ti West's other 2009 release, The House of the Devil, will probably be very surprised by Cabin Fever 2. Unless, that is, they are also familiar with The Roost, a terrifyingly bad film West directed back in 2005 that pops up occasionally on a certain horror-centric cable channel that shall remain nameless. The gap in quality between those two movies is less a gap than it is a chasm. And when you realize that Cabin Fever 2 was actually shot about halfway between those two films (it was shelved for two and a half years before finally getting a release), everything falls into place. Which is to say, while this movie is not fit to lick the bootprints of The House of the Devil by anyone's standards, it's a couple of orders of magnitude better than The Roost.If you will recall, we left Cabin Fever, Eli Roth's wildly entertaining gorefest, with one of the victims finally succumbing at the very edge of a body of water, after which we get a quick montage of... exactly where this movie is going. The nasty flesh-eating bug that was previously confined to a crazy woodsman and a cabinful of partying kids is now drifting into the local water supply (which also happens to contain a bottled-water factory). The virus hits town just as the local high schoolers are getting ready for prom, and our pals the guys in the biohazard suits show up just in time for the first kids to start falling apart, locking in the uninfected (most notably Deadgirl's Noah Segan and Factory Girl's Alexi Wasser) with a bunch of crazy, murderous thugs.Rider Strong (briefly) and Giuseppe Andrews return from the first movie; otherwise, the cast is all-new, and not all that hot, aside from a cameo (even more briefly) from Larry Fessenden. The script was written by one Joshua Malkin, the second unit director on the 2007 film Borderland (where he came into contact with Rider Strong, presumably); this is his first and, to date, last attempt at feature screenwriting (off a story by West and Randy Pearlstein, who co-wrote the script for the first one with Eli Roth). It is, not surprisingly, terrible. But really, all you need to know about this movie is that West attempted to disown it and was denied by the studio.

Not a real winner to most people, and hardcore horror fans seem to only find it slightly amusing.  I guess I'm no different.  It was painless, and sometimes even fun, but nothing I'd watch again.As you probably know, the virus from the first time basically ends up in a high school on prom night(which makes the whole ""Spring Fever"" thing a head scratcher).  Before the prom climax, we're treated to a rather standard high school melodrama about an average Joe trying to win the love of his childhood sweetheart.  Naturally she's dating the biggest jerk in the school, and naturally our hero is accompanied by a chubby, horny wisecracking Seth Rogan type character.  And of course when the poop finally hits the fan, our hero and his love interest seem to be the only people who didn't get infected and are now looking for a way out of the school.  Plus, the school(and town) have been sealed off by those pesky gun toting brutes in the gas masks and hazmat suits who are mowing down everybody in sight.  No explanation is given as to who they are or where they're from, but since we've all seen these types of films many times over, we can safely assume they are a special government branch sent out to contain the virus.Like the first film, this one goes for the more zany, comic angle, rather than trying to scare your pants off.  The emphasis is really on gruesomeness.  Like many horror films these days, it likes to see how far it can push things.SEE....A Pus Oozing Penis In Shocking Technicolor!!!!While the grossness is fun in it's own right, the movie isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is, nor are the characters all that interesting.  It is rather cliche ridden, in both the horror film sense as well as the high school teen flick sense.I was kind of surprised however to see a scene in which an obese girl is seduced by dashing, blond jock.  Usually in films, any sex involving an obese character is usually done for comical reasons.  Or the seducer does it because he has selfish ulterior motives(like distracting the girl while his dimwitted buddy sabotages something).  But that's not the case here-The guy seems legitimately turned on by her and takes her away to do the deed with her.  Of course, this being the movie it is, it ends gruesomely. But his intentions seemed pure though!  I thought that was kinda cool actually.Problems plagued the production of this film, and director Ti West probably wants to distance himself as much as he can from it.  Considering all that went on, and a lack of Eli Roth's involvement(not that I really care about that, because I think Roth is the most overrated horror director of the last decade), the movie could have been so much worse....so much.

1299205,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B002YI9304,Steven Herring,"[0, 0]",I saw the original and when I saw this sequel on NETFLIX I could not pass it up. It is actually pretty good. No it's not as scary as the first. It looks and feels like a B horror film but it does entertain throughout. The acting is pretty good and the special effects look realistic. I recommend it to horror fans that like blood and some genre cliches. You see most of it coming but it is still cool to see it go down. It's not as good as the original but based on the lower budget that they filmed it on that is not surprising. Also they leave room for a third which I would love to see. If you like flesh eating viruses and some gory and disturbing scenes then check this movie out it is very entertaining.,4,Pretty Good,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,709,"['saw', 'original', 'when', 'saw', 'sequel', 'NETFLIX', 'could', 'not', 'pass', 'up', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'scary', 'first', 'feels', 'B', 'horror', 'film', 'entertain', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'realistic', 'recommend', 'horror', 'fans', 'blood', 'genre', 'cliches', 'see', 'most', 'coming', 'still', 'cool', 'see', 'go', 'down', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'based', 'lower', 'budget', 'filmed', 'not', 'surprising', 'Also', 'leave', 'room', 'third', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'like', 'flesh', 'eating', 'viruses', 'gory', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'then', 'check', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining']",Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever

While I was a bit hesitant at wondering how Ti would address the blatant overuse of blood and gore that was used in the first Cabin Fever he showed he can do a fun B styled horror movie just as well as one that focuses on suspense. This is two movies under his belt that are just outstanding pieces of work that draw on the roots of older horror themes.The movie itself begins with a police officer who was involved in the original story, Winston, cleaning up after another survivor who was hit by a truck. We are quickly after that shown in an amazingly well done cartoon style that is completely reminiscent of the 80's how the disease was able to spread through a water company to a nearby school. We flash to the school and are introduced to our lead characters. It's the day of Prom and a combination of a group of friends and acquaintances are gathering to prepare for the night. While most of this group are planning on staying in there are a few that want to go and show us that most end up there.At prom the infected bottled water is being rapidly spread through the student body as it has been used in the punch that everyone is drinking from. The amount of creative uses of this disease as well as the gore that is used completely reminds me of a classic B movie. One of the first instances of the gratuitous blood involves a pool scene which I'm sure everyone will love. One warning though - soon after though we are shown the government has been made aware of the water supply being infected and the entire school is locked down.There is a scene that every single male watching this will visibly cringe at. It wasn't necessary to add in and is Ti's cruel joke on us all. That's my only explanation. Seriously you'll briefly hate him for the scene before being drawn back into the story.Ti closed the film with another 80's styled cartoon that showed how they could lead it into a third movie or end it where it's at. While I am loving Ti's stylized almost time period pieces I hope he is able to tackle a modern day or paranormal film with the same form of style, currently in the works Ti has a comedy being made and more importantly for what I just said a horror film about two employees that work at a haunted hotel. While it's not planned to be released until 2011 I hope he is able to do a paranormal movie as the two I've just gone over were amazing pieces of work and I cannot wait to see where he goes with it.",4,Ti West makes a sequel that by all rights should have been a train wreck a VERY enjoyable watch!,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2575,"['suppose', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'horror', 'movie', 'done', 'older', 'time', 'period', 'bringing', 'Ti', 'West', 'was', 'absolute', 'best', 'move', 'could', 'go', 'was', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'wondering', 'how', 'Ti', 'would', 'address', 'blatant', 'overuse', 'blood', 'gore', 'was', 'used', 'first', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'showed', 'can', 'do', 'fun', 'B', 'styled', 'horror', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'suspense', 'two', 'movies', 'belt', 'are', 'just', 'outstanding', 'pieces', 'work', 'roots', 'older', 'horror', 'themes.The', 'movie', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'original', 'story', 'Winston', 'cleaning', 'up', 'survivor', 'who', 'was', 'hit', 'truck', 'are', 'quickly', 'shown', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'cartoon', 'style', 'completely', 'reminiscent', '80', 'how', 'disease', 'was', 'able', 'spread', 'water', 'company', 'nearby', 'school', 'flash', 'school', 'are', 'introduced', 'lead', 'characters', 'day', 'Prom', 'combination', 'group', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'are', 'gathering', 'prepare', 'night', 'most', 'group', 'are', 'planning', 'staying', 'are', 'few', 'want', 'go', 'show', 'most', 'end', 'up', 'there.At', 'infected', 'bottled', 'water', 'being', 'rapidly', 'spread', 'student', 'body', 'been', 'used', 'punch', 'everyone', 'drinking', 'amount', 'creative', 'uses', 'disease', 'as', 'well', 'gore', 'used', 'completely', 'classic', 'B', 'movie', 'One', 'first', 'instances', 'gratuitous', 'blood', 'pool', 'scene', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everyone', 'will', 'love', 'One', 'warning', 'soon', 'are', 'shown', 'government', 'been', 'made', 'aware', 'water', 'supply', 'being', 'infected', 'entire', 'school', 'locked', 'scene', 'single', 'male', 'watching', 'will', 'visibly', 'cringe', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'add', 'Ti', 'cruel', 'joke', 'only', 'explanation', 'Seriously', ""'ll"", 'briefly', 'hate', 'scene', 'being', 'drawn', 'back', 'story.Ti', 'closed', 'film', '80', 'styled', 'cartoon', 'showed', 'how', 'could', 'lead', 'third', 'movie', 'end', 'where', 'am', 'loving', 'Ti', 'stylized', 'almost', 'time', 'period', 'pieces', 'hope', 'able', 'tackle', 'modern', 'day', 'paranormal', 'film', 'same', 'form', 'style', 'currently', 'works', 'Ti', 'comedy', 'being', 'made', 'more', 'importantly', 'what', 'just', 'said', 'horror', 'film', 'two', 'employees', 'work', 'haunted', 'hotel', 'not', 'planned', 'be', 'released', '2011', 'hope', 'able', 'do', 'paranormal', 'movie', 'two', ""'ve"", 'just', 'gone', 'over', 'were', 'amazing', 'pieces', 'work', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'where']",Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever

In keeping the crossover material, it would've worked better as the second film in a ""Fever"" series, kind of like how George Romero's films work.
