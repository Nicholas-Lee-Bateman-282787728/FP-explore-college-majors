That was THE ONLY REASON I picked this movie up.Tracy Wainwright (Brian White) is in search of a job at Love Net Dating Service.  As Tracy becomes an employee he quickly learns that his lippy, older boss whose name ironically is Mrs. Jones may have hired him strictly for the BENEFITS!Love Net is in serious preparation for a re-launch.  They show clips of the applicants in search for the one.  WHEW....It's a scary world out there!Unfortunately for Tracy, Mrs. Jones uses her power to connect herself to him.  A promotion, office sex, gifts, and then some type of way she uses LOVE!  Where'd that come from?  Tracy is slowly getting acquainted with Desiree (Kim Fields) a wedding coordinator who he's feeling but as luck would have it work always seems to get in the middle of that!It's not hard to believe that Tracy has gotten himself in a hell of a situation.  It's usually what happens when there is fraternizing in the work place.  What's a Brother to do?  Can Tracy keep his two lives separate while reaping the fruits from both?This is a very bizarre movie filled with too much overacting.  ALL of the characters have you looking at the TV like WTF!  I can't front I did laugh some.  Hubby and I were mainly laughing at how over the top the ENTIRE movie was.  It did have some key points (((EXAMPLE))) you get to glimpse Cutie (Brian White) naked quite a few times (not frontal) it is after all a love story, and you know those weaken my knees!LOW BUDGET leaps off the screen at you which plagues the chances of this being a movie that warrants a serious look.",3,"You, Me, and She.........................................................................",1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,1608,"['Brian', 'White', 'very', 'attractive', 'man', 'was', 'THE', 'ONLY', 'REASON', 'picked', 'movie', 'up.Tracy', 'Wainwright', 'Brian', 'White', 'search', 'job', 'Love', 'Net', 'Dating', 'Service', 'Tracy', 'employee', 'quickly', 'lippy', 'older', 'boss', 'name', 'ironically', 'Mrs.', 'Jones', 'may', 'have', 'hired', 'strictly', 'BENEFITS', 'Love', 'Net', 'serious', 'preparation', 're-launch', 'show', 'clips', 'applicants', 'search', 'one', 'WHEW', '.It', 'scary', 'world', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'Tracy', 'Mrs.', 'Jones', 'power', 'connect', 'promotion', 'office', 'sex', 'gifts', 'then', 'type', 'way', 'LOVE', 'Where', ""'d"", 'come', 'Tracy', 'slowly', 'getting', 'acquainted', 'Desiree', 'Kim', 'Fields', 'wedding', 'coordinator', 'who', 'feeling', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'work', 'always', 'get', 'middle', 'not', 'hard', 'believe', 'Tracy', 'gotten', 'hell', 'situation', 'usually', 'what', 'when', 'fraternizing', 'work', 'place', 'What', 'Brother', 'do', 'Can', 'Tracy', 'keep', 'two', 'lives', 'separate', 'reaping', 'fruits', 'very', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'filled', 'too', 'much', 'overacting', 'characters', 'have', 'looking', 'TV', 'WTF', 'ca', ""n't"", 'front', 'did', 'laugh', 'Hubby', 'were', 'mainly', 'laughing', 'how', 'top', 'ENTIRE', 'movie', 'was', 'did', 'have', 'key', 'points', 'EXAMPLE', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Cutie', 'Brian', 'White', 'naked', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'frontal', 'love', 'story', 'know', 'weaken', 'knees', 'LOW', 'BUDGET', 'screen', 'chances', 'being', 'movie', 'warrants', 'serious', 'look']",N/A
805117,A1FATTRIXTSTEB,B0001GWBP0,"Pamela Jarmon-Wade ""Tx Red Rose""","[24, 27]","Me & Mrs. Jones stars Kim Fields (Desiree), Wanda Christine (Mrs. Jones), Brian White (Tracy Wainwright), Victor Williams (Jersey), Melvin Payne (Willis) and Michael Sommers (Ray).  It is the story of a young man who will have to choose between career and his love life...but he can't have both in this movie.The movie opens up with Mrs. Jones interviewing Mr. Wainwright for a graphic arts designer position with her company (LoveNet Dating Service).  She balls his resume up and tosses it in the trash can.  Then she proceeds to be tough as nails and brashy as she tells him to verbally sell himself over fifty better qualified candidates.  After digging deeper inside himself than he probably ever has in his entire life (20+ years), she ends the interview with, ""I will let you know"".Later at his unkept apartment, Tracy listens to several job rejection calls and then last, but not least he hears Mrs. Jones' generous salary offer of $35,000 and a start date.  He thinks this is his world as he does his boyish celebratory dance.  Little does he know...it may be Mrs. Jones' world.Mrs. Jones has no problem hurling profanity and icy glares just as freely as rice is thrown after a wedding.  The company has a racially diverse staff.  They add flavor, humor and wisdom to the storyline.  There is Ray, a nerdy looking white guy who changes women like socks, speaks in ethnic tones and must eat chitlins cause he wants soul.  Willis is 40 something, married, Project Manager who takes Tracy to a strip club one night and home to have a good meal prepared by his lovable wife on another night.  He imparts wisdom on Tracy by letting him know that success is nothing without someone to share it with.  He risks his marriage by playing around with strippers and lets Mrs. Jones belittle him when she pleases.  Jersey is bi-sexual and humorous.  He mistakes Tracy's indecisiveness and withdrawn silence as a sign that he wants to come out of the closet.  He volunteers to take Tracy on a journey of self discovery... to a Gay Bar.The company is preparing for a re-launch and seeking capital with goals of becoming the #1 dating service.  The company is seeking to double it's sign up in the next three months, but the video clips of prospects would turn Pee Wee Herman off.The filming of the movie takes place in San Francisco, CA and the background scenes are nice.  While on a lunch break with Willis...Tracy spots an attractive Desiree, who accidently leaves her planner in the plaza.  Tracy gets the planner, finds a business card and shows up at the next scheduled appointment in the book.  Desiree is a wedding consultant and repays Tracy for returning her book, by going out with him.In the meantime, Mrs. Jones initiates a sexual encounter with Tracy in the supply closet.  Then he goes on a date with Desiree and love is on the horizon.Soon he is promoted to Director of Art & Design.  Tracy volleys back and forth from meaningless sex with Mrs. Jones, to sunset strolls on the beach with Desiree.  After making love with Desiree, Mrs. Jones is parked outside his apartment watching him.  Soon she buys him a cell phone and thus the heat is turned up.  Mrs. Jones goes from being in control to out of control.  She is stalker/fatal attraction material.  Eventually Tracy realizes he has to make a decision.  Which one will it be?When the inevitable line, ""Me & Mrs. Jones got a thing going on"" is spoken...I thought it would be funny as I flashed back on Billy Paul signing that song.  But instead it was deep like a poetic phrase from a Shakesphere play.  I'm still wondering why her name was Mrs. Jones in the movie when she was obviously single?At any rate it is a nice movie.  Will Tracy let the seduction of this older woman, Mrs. Jones, with sex, money and promotions rule his world?  Will he listen to the wisdom of Willis who caused his happy home to fall apart?  Will the company succeed as Mrs. Jones plans?

805121,A2WFNNKUK3OC2X,B0001GWBP0,T. Winston,"[2, 2]",This was an enjoyable and funny film but boy was Brian stupid.  He lands a job at love.net. (a small company where the boss has a thing for him). Brian comes off as completely gullible and allows the boss of the company to touch him inappropriately.  What is weird is when Brian kisses his boss out of nowhere.  I guess since his boss is an older woman he decides to fall for someone more his age.  But Brian still decides to sleep with his boss while seeing someone else.  It is obvious that Brian is a very attractive man and the boss falls for him.  But the stupid part is how Brian allowed himself to be controlled by his boss.  She was calling him at all times of the day buying him gifts and constantly having sex with him.  They made Brian look as if he did not have a brain throughout this whole film.  From my perspective the boss was a pushy woman but Brian never had to give in to her advances if he wasn't sincere.  Instead he just lead the boss on which wasn't right.  And Brian had the nerve to get mad at his boss and actually put her out of business.  I really don't feel any of that was necessary and Brian could have walked away from that job at any given moment.  Brian should have known better that having sex with his boss was very inappropriate and a bad idea.This movie was decent and funny and had likeable characters but Brian was very foolish and ended up looking like a fool and not Misses Jones lol.
