Maybe that's the point of the movie.The core of the story going back to his ancestral hometown to bring back his father's body -- don't they watch Family Plots? think air shipping -- is somber. Of course, that's not the real point of the film. Its the interaction between Bloom and Dunst.They're sweet. I've never had so much cute romance around a funeral. Have you?The ""funeral"" itself is an over-the-top piece of malarkey. Susan Sarandon's character studied tap (foreshadowing!) just for that number folks. Please!  (Where's Al Pacino going ""Hoo ha??)  The band, that funny, funny fire. (This is late-at-night-third-bottle-of-bourbon plotting at its finest.)The long car trip back to California, no Oregon, was excellent. The map (and Dunst's narration of it) is wonderful. (Bu why the jarring stop in Memphis where Martin Luther King, Jr. died? A total change of mood: the movie is not about segregation and injustice at all. Heck, you could turn the whole thing into the book Assassination Vacation.It might be a better movie.)I'd say I half liked the movie and half hated it. It's a meandering vehicle for two big-name stars to act in. Well Kristen Dunst is acting and Orlando Bloom is being an inert  hunk.

I remember when this Cameron Crowe film was released in 2005, it got horrible reviews from the critics so I avoided seeing it for a long time. Turns out Elizbethtown is an underrated gem! The chemistry between Bloom and Dunst is very cute and relaxed. Judy Greer is a delight as Bloom's sister and actually for once, Susan Sarandon gives a solid performance.

The beginning seems almost a satire of Crowe's previous ""Jerry Maguire"": Orlando Bloom plays Drew Baylor, a hot shot shoe designer at a Nike-like company that sees its latest sport shoe bomb, causing its company to lose one billion dollars overnight. Fired by the company's CEO (a nice cameo by Alec Baldwin), he contemplates suicide by inserting a knife into his exercise bicycle. But before he succeeds, he receives a call from his sister informing him their father has died. Flying to the small town in Kentucky (the Elizabethtown of the title) where the funeral will be held, he meets a quirky and flirty flight attendant (the sort you never find in real life), played by Kirsten Dunst, whom he will eventually fall in love, after one of the longest mobile phone calls in history.

Pish posh. True, Elizabethtown MAY not be quite on par as Almost Famous, but it's still a really good movie. And it has Cameron Crowe written all over it. You'll get lost in Orlando Bloom's eyes (guys will too, let's all admit it) and be swept away with Kirsten Dunst's ""whimsical"" performance. That's the word. Whimsical.Bloom stars as Drew Baylor, a shoe designer whose new shoe-- the ""Spasmotica"" --has just been recalled. This one shoe has lost the company close to one billion dollars. Bloom narrates throughout the film (yes, like Jerry Maguire... blast these comparisons!) and tells us that it wasn't just a failure, it was a fiasco. He makes it a point to go home and use a knife strapped to an exercise bike to kill himself, but before he can, his phone rings. He almost doesn't answer it, but alas, he does and it's his sister with the news that their father has died of a heart attack. So Drew takes the red eye to Elizabethtown, his father's hometown in Kentucky, in order to take the body back to Oregon, where Drew's parents have lived for some eighteen years. Though everyone in Elizabethtown keeps insisting that he lived in California, whisked away by some wiley girl all those years ago. People in this small town love and truly know one another, and Drew's father, Mitch, was a legacy. Everyone has a story about Mitch. On the flight, Drew meets perky flight attendant Claire (Dunst), whom you can tell doesn't want to let Drew out of her sight. Can't say I blame her. She sees something in him.We learn along with Drew just how great his father was and how much he'll be missed, and you can see subtle changes in Drew's attitude as the film progresses. Bloom really shines in this role. I'm just thankful he's not carrying a sword or arrows. I'm not a big fan of Dunst, but I really like her in this role. It just fit. Take my word for it! This movie is also backed by a magnificent soundtrack (it's Cameron Crowe after all!), which is definitely part of the reason the movie works so well. Music is just as effective as a great actor. I really like Drew and Claire. They know so much and so little at the same time. They're just like everyone else. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",4,It's Good! For the Love of God!

Supposedly love at first sight.  Just today, I opened the door at the courthouse and saw before me the most handsome fellow alive with gorgeous blue eyes.  I put my hand over my heart and didn't look back.  Had I been as young as the blonde airline attendant in this film, I would have jumped on him.I mean this man in Knoxville makes Orlando look like a little boy who's being led astray by a woman he met briefly on the plane.  It is the 'mod' version of that game played out in the Eddie Fisher song, ""A Man Chases a Girl (Until She Catches Him).""  Since this was produced by Tom Cruise, that's why it was so funky and irreligious.  After Eyes Wide Shut, he couldn't go any further from God so he uses this item to show how his actions of the past year or so could be acceptable.  He failed.If you saw 'Little Miss Sunshine,' which was supposed to be about a dysfunctional family, you will be able to appreciate the real dysfunctional gathering of this grieving/bickering family in Elizabethtown.  This was the first time I have ever seen a smiling corpse.  With the kind of memorial service where individuals got up on the stage as ""speakers"" to make confessions and re-live their indiscretions, promoting themselves and not the deceased ""loved one.""  He must have been glad to be away from such a loving group.The best part of that rowdy family was Zach as he looked at age 25 with Tristan, his first son.  To tell the truth, there were way too many rowdy kids in that large family who were happy the patriarch was dead.  The get-together before the gravesite fiasco took place in a grand theater somewhere -- kinda weird.  It was festive and ""fun"" for those involved, and had Orlando the one in charge laughing.  I don't believe in laughter at a funeral.  Finally they have the fiasco with an empty casket (orange, no less), no blue butterfly to land on his chest.  He took the urn of ashes on his roadtrip back to the world so as not to wallow in misery, and dumped them in the river outside Louisville, KY which fed into the Mississippi River.  That's what I had in my mind when I returned in 1999, that mine would return to the place where I was born, where the mouth of the Tennessee River begins; but I have changed my mind about that.He's on the road again, too bad Charlie Daniels wasn't included in the recorded music she had provided for this return to normalcy first to Memphis, learning the blues, re-living historical events, even the 1960s sit-ins and a reference to Martin Luther King; across the Mississippi bridge to Arkansas where he drove into a glorious sunset.

When the film concluded, I tried to figure out what it was trying to say.  I truly believe that Crowe was trying to make a profound statement about life and how we should enjoy it.  But as I write this review a few days later, I can't recall the message at all.I do remember that this was a fun cute movie with a lot of interesting characters that took the viewer on a journey that provided a few laughs and a lot of smiles.  Drew Baylor has just lost his shoe company 1 BILLION dollars after designing a flawed shoe called the ""Spasmodica.""  Drew flees back to his dad's hometown after his dad dies from a sudden heart attack.  Drew meets Claire, the flight attendant, on the way there and they make a connection.Once in Elizabethtown, Drew meets all the people who loved his dad so much, even though Drew had grown distant from his dad.  This allows Drew to reconnect to his past and to realize maybe life isn't all about work.  Drew also gives Claire a call and they talk on the phone and meet and talk and I guess eventually fall in love.  I fell in love (figuratively) with Renee Zellweger in Jerry McGuire.  Claire the same type of character.  She is incredibly sweet and charming.  Yet she is also vulnerable.  How could someone that cute and sweet still be single?  What is her past, why does she live alone?  Is she even making up the existence of her boyfriend?  Why has she accepted the fact she will always be alone.  There are so many questions about Claire that needed answered before I can consider this a great movie.Crowe delivers with some of the minor characters.  I enjoyed Susan Sarandon's speech at the funeral and Drew's cousin.  But the best were Chuck and Cindy and their wedding.  You'll have to see the movie to see these too.Elizabethtown is a solid movie, but I just wasn't moved by or maybe I didn't get the message Cameron Crowe was trying to deliver.",4,"Cute and charming movie, nothing more",1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2063,"['Jerry', 'McGuire', 'probably', 'favorite', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'all-time', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Elizabethtown', 'latest', 'movie', 'spite', 'mixed', 'film', 'received', 'When', 'film', 'concluded', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'truly', 'believe', 'Crowe', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'profound', 'statement', 'life', 'how', 'should', 'enjoy', 'write', 'review', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'message', 'all.I', 'do', 'remember', 'was', 'fun', 'cute', 'movie', 'lot', 'interesting', 'characters', 'took', 'viewer', 'journey', 'provided', 'few', 'laughs', 'lot', 'smiles', 'Drew', 'Baylor', 'just', 'lost', 'shoe', 'company', '1', 'BILLION', 'dollars', 'designing', 'flawed', 'shoe', 'called', 'Spasmodica', 'Drew', 'flees', 'back', 'dad', 'hometown', 'dad', 'sudden', 'heart', 'attack', 'Drew', 'Claire', 'flight', 'attendant', 'way', 'make', 'connection.Once', 'Elizabethtown', 'Drew', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'dad', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'Drew', 'had', 'grown', 'distant', 'dad', 'Drew', 'reconnect', 'past', 'realize', 'maybe', 'life', ""n't"", 'work', 'Drew', 'also', 'Claire', 'call', 'talk', 'phone', 'meet', 'talk', 'guess', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'fell', 'love', 'figuratively', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'Claire', 'same', 'type', 'character', 'incredibly', 'sweet', 'charming', 'also', 'vulnerable', 'How', 'could', 'someone', 'cute', 'sweet', 'still', 'be', 'single', 'What', 'past', 'why', 'live', 'alone', 'even', 'making', 'up', 'existence', 'boyfriend', 'Why', 'accepted', 'fact', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'alone', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'Claire', 'needed', 'answered', 'can', 'consider', 'great', 'movie.Crowe', 'delivers', 'minor', 'characters', 'enjoyed', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'speech', 'funeral', 'Drew', 'cousin', 'best', 'were', 'Chuck', 'Cindy', 'wedding', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'see', 'too.Elizabethtown', 'solid', 'movie', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'moved', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'message', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'was', 'trying', 'deliver']",N/A

Being a pretty big Cameron Crowe fan (VANILLA SKY, 2001), I came into this movie with high expectations. Some of them were met (music selection, unusual use of camera on characters), but the basic story and how it all came together obviously held too many challenges even in the expert hands of someone like Mr. Crowe.The story (if you can believe it) is about a shoe designer named Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) who just lost his employer's sneaker company nearly a billion dollars. Having dedicated the last eight years of his life to making this shoe-gone-bad, Drew heads to his apartment with suicide on his mind. But before he can kill himself, his phone rings (cliche'?) and it's his sister telling him that their father just died. Being the eldest child, he is assigned to head to Kentucky, retrieve their father's body from ""the other side of the family"" and prepare it for cremation. Drew decides to delay his own death while dealing with his father's. So he packs up and heads to Kentucky ...but on the flight there he runs into a beautiful (if somewhat confused) stewardess named Claire (Kirsten Dunst) who forms a strange bond with him. They chat awkwardly on the plane and Claire forces information onto Drew about how to get to Elizabethtown without getting lost (and, of course, he DOES get lost).Eventually - after finding his way to Elizabethtown - Drew has to deal with his father's side of the family. But they're accepting, loving, and have a southern charm about them that's centered around food and family and more food.Drew calls Claire one night and they talk all night long, then decide to meet up again. A relationship starts to blossom, but each is held back by secrets (Claire tells Drew she has a boyfriend and Drew hasn't told Claire about his monumental shoe failure.)Getting involved in a stranger's wedding, deciding whether or not to cremate Dad, dealing with family on both sides of the U.S., finding love, accepting loss and failure, traveling across the States, refinding love, and a multitude of other items are touched on in the film. But only just.The movie's length was obviously an issue. It was only two hours. For a film that's trying to cover so much ground, more time was needed. The impact of Drew's father's death - and Drew's travels across the U.S. with his father's ashes - lost its impact on me because of all the other side stories (his mother's near mental meltdown, his sister having to deal with their mother, coping with out-of-control children by having them watch a video on blowing-up a house, etc.)On the upside, this is a story about life. It shows everything that goes on between birth and death and love and hate. It's beautifully edited with an excellent soundtrack. It just needed more time to help completely flesh-out all of the storylines.",3,"I STILL LOVE CAMERON CROWE, JUST NOT THAT FOND ABOUT THIS FILM...",1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,2890,"['ELIZABETHTOWN', 'film', 'trying', 'get', 'too', 'many', 'messages', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'Being', 'pretty', 'big', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'fan', 'VANILLA', 'SKY', '2001', 'came', 'movie', 'high', 'expectations', 'were', 'met', 'music', 'selection', 'unusual', 'use', 'camera', 'characters', 'basic', 'story', 'how', 'came', 'together', 'obviously', 'held', 'too', 'many', 'challenges', 'even', 'expert', 'hands', 'someone', 'Mr.', 'Crowe.The', 'story', 'can', 'believe', 'shoe', 'designer', 'named', 'Drew', 'Baylor', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'employer', 'sneaker', 'company', 'nearly', 'billion', 'dollars', 'Having', 'dedicated', 'last', 'eight', 'years', 'life', 'making', 'shoe-gone-bad', 'Drew', 'apartment', 'suicide', 'mind', 'can', 'kill', 'phone', 'rings', 'cliche', 'sister', 'telling', 'father', 'just', 'died', 'Being', 'eldest', 'child', 'assigned', 'head', 'Kentucky', 'retrieve', 'father', 'body', 'other', 'side', 'family', 'prepare', 'cremation', 'Drew', 'delay', 'own', 'death', 'dealing', 'father', 'up', 'heads', 'Kentucky', 'flight', 'there', 'beautiful', 'somewhat', 'confused', 'stewardess', 'named', 'Claire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'strange', 'bond', 'chat', 'awkwardly', 'plane', 'Claire', 'forces', 'information', 'Drew', 'how', 'get', 'Elizabethtown', 'getting', 'lost', 'course', 'get', 'lost', '.Eventually', 'finding', 'way', 'Elizabethtown', 'Drew', 'deal', 'father', 'side', 'family', ""'re"", 'accepting', 'loving', 'have', 'southern', 'charm', 'centered', 'food', 'family', 'more', 'food.Drew', 'calls', 'Claire', 'one', 'night', 'talk', 'night', 'long', 'then', 'decide', 'meet', 'up', 'again', 'relationship', 'blossom', 'held', 'back', 'secrets', 'Claire', 'Drew', 'boyfriend', 'Drew', ""n't"", 'told', 'Claire', 'monumental', 'shoe', 'failure', 'Getting', 'involved', 'stranger', 'wedding', 'deciding', 'not', 'cremate', 'Dad', 'dealing', 'family', 'sides', 'U.S.', 'finding', 'love', 'accepting', 'loss', 'failure', 'traveling', 'States', 'refinding', 'love', 'multitude', 'other', 'items', 'are', 'touched', 'film', 'only', 'just.The', 'movie', 'length', 'was', 'obviously', 'issue', 'was', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'trying', 'cover', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'needed', 'impact', 'Drew', 'father', 'death', 'Drew', 'travels', 'U.S.', 'father', 'ashes', 'lost', 'impact', 'other', 'side', 'stories', 'mother', 'mental', 'meltdown', 'sister', 'having', 'deal', 'mother', 'coping', 'out-of-control', 'children', 'having', 'watch', 'video', 'blowing-up', 'house', 'etc', 'upside', 'story', 'life', 'everything', 'birth', 'death', 'love', 'hate', 'beautifully', 'edited', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'help', 'completely', 'flesh-out', 'storylines']",N/A

170243,A2HVKT2ZYDMFKQ,1415719284,"Captdoherty ""Captdoherty""","[2, 4]","First things first- I love Cameron Crowe's movies!He is that rare film maker who can infuse realistic life events with a magical optimism. His characters are always three dimensional and no screenwriter captures the cadences and mannerisms of real life conversation better.Mr. Crowe is an amazing talent who will be making films for many, many years (hopefully decades) to come.But alas, in every great career, there are a few misfires. ""Elizabethtown"" will be remembered as his first real one. (""Vanilla Sky"" wasn't great, but that movie was not really a ""Cameron Crowe"" movie. He was merely a hired gun for someone else and the film was a remake.)""Elizabethtown"" is a mess. Even though I can see what Mr. Crowe was attempting to do, it just doesn't succeed. Some scenes are immensely entertaining (the freebird sequence, the ""knife bike"" machine, Alec Baldwin's cameo, any sequence involving the Chuck and Lisa wedding) but the film as a whole just does not add up.Some reasons as I see it:1) Orlando Bloom never really took off as the leading man. He is asked to be sort of a younger version of Jerry Maguire and he doesn't rise to the occasion. As portrayed, he just wasn't a character you could identify with and root for. Another actor (one in Tom Cruise's league) might have been able to save this movie with a more effective performance.2) Susan Sarandon's performance was embarrassing, but then again, she wasn't given anything to work with. Her character never becomes a real person. She is simply a series of quirks.3) Judy Greer, as the sister, is again wasted. She's given little to do. (please, someone give this wonderful, beautiful, talented actress the part she deserves!)4) So many subplots are underdeveloped. The family in elizabethtown all have plot points that are never resolved. Ex: the subplot of Bloom's cousin and his son is addressed, set up, and then dropped. My suspicion is that this was all left on the cutting room floor. (the original version of this film was much longer when it was first screened.)5) The soundtracks for Mr. Crowe's films have always been wonderful, but they have also always served the story. In this movie, the story seems to serve the soundtrack.6) kirsten dunst is (as usual) amazing. She lights up the screen every time she appears, but like Judy Greer, she is also given little to do.

How does someone write humanity with such sincerity and humility? We don't know, but oh man, do we love the Crowe.Allow me to explain just why this film is fantastic. I'll just make a list (beware- there may be spoilers)... by the way, this list is heavily inspired by a blog post I saw a few weeks ago, by a die-hard Elizabethtown fan.- Kirsten as Claire Coburn. If she is not one of the sweetest, coolest, cutest characters in the history of cinema, I don't know who is. This is absolutely my favorite version of Kirsten Dunst.- the music (this is true with every Crowe film). Mentioned here and there, below.- the pure, welcoming sound of the cicadas as Drew gets out of his car in Elizabethtown.- ""Free Bird, huh?""- Rusty's Learning To Listen Part 8- Chuck & Cindy. Lovin' life, lovin' you.- all-night first phone conversations, proving connections are real and treasured.- 60B!!!- ""Hi! Bill Banyon, good to see ya!""- Claire's walk-of-shame, the following morning at the hotel- Claire referring to the Mississippi River as ""Mark Twain's muse"" and also ""Jeff Buckley's funeral bed."" Now that is one great lesson in classic literature and amazing music in one sentence.- the fact that this movie IS on the longer side, but it never stagnates as there's always something funny or heartfelt around the corner. Well-written and directed wonderfully.- ""Come Pick Me Up"" by Ryan Adams- ""Summerlong"" by Kathleen Edwards- ""Learning To Fly"" by Tom Petty- ""Square One"" by Tom Petty- ""My Father's Gun"" by Elton John- ""Same In Any Language"" by My Morning Jacket (and also I-Nine's fantastic version during the credits)-- a wonderful song written by Nancy Wilson- ""Don't I Hold You"" by Wheat (""Some music... needs air. Roll down your window"")- ""Passing By"" by Ulrich Schnauss (the scene before they watch the sunrise)- every single note of Nancy Wilson's fantastic score- when Drew scatters the ashes at the Civil Rights Museum. And the classic song that plays during that part.- ""We peaked on the phone / I'm really tired."" and the VIEW from that bridge.- The scene where Uncle Dale, Aunt Dora, Drew and Bill Banyon are in the kitchen... just radiates ""life."" You can feel yourself in that room, as you have been in that moment a few times before, in your own life.- Last looks- We've contained magic! In a shoe!!!- ""lou-i-VULL""- It's like lookin' in a mirror.and last but not least:- the last 14 minutes of the film. Seriously. If you don't feel that ENTIRE road trip... everything Claire wrote about/narrates... and the music she chose... and how, in one road trip, Drew comes to the realization that life really ain't that bad, and if you have good friends, family, music, and special moments... it makes it all worth while.... if you don't feel that, then you are truly missing out.And... finally, the fantastic background music when Drew sees the red hat. The mandolin or banjo or whatever it is... when it hits those three chords a few times around... it chokes me up EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Every time I watch the movie, I cry or get choked up right there. It kills me! Such a perfect, perfect scene with PERFECT music. And the creativity and planning the ""World's 2nd Largest Farmer's Market"" had to take (as a character, and to Crowe's credit as writer and director). Unreal.I've seen Elizabethtown close to 200 times. Yes, really. Sometimes I just put my DVD player on repeat and have it as I'm writing songs or working on computer stuff. It always warms my heart when I watch it. So much so that I've considered moving to Louisville or Elizabethtown, KY, in hopes that I could meet a wonderful girl like Claire Coburn. Sure, that's naive and stupid... but, sometimes, life can surprise you... and sometimes, things like that really do happen.A wonderful story. I want my dad to see it. He's not a big movie guy, but I think he would appreciate it.I'll end this review with this thought-- don't ever let life or any moment pass you by. Live, love, laugh, and make this world a better place through your actions, words, and anything you make, from music to books... a hearty meal to a homemade birthday card. It's the little things in life that make life so special.Now go and buy this DVD if you don't already own it. :)",5,Needs ten stars. It's that good.

Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous are 2 great films and to see the follow up is of course quite anticipated. Granted he has misstepped before(Vanilla Sky was meh and outside of the boombox scene, Say Anything wasn't much) but at least he seemed like he was going to pull another great one out of his sleeve. Too bad we got Elizabethtown instead.Drew works for a shoe company, spending many years and money on the next big thing, a hideous shoe unfortunately named the . When it becomes probably the biggest financial bomb in the history of shoes, he decides to kill himself(in what's probably the lamest suicide idea ever) only he gets a phone call: his dad died. So he's sent by his mom and sister to Kentucky to deal with things.On the way he meets Claire, a way too perfect feeling flight attendant that he strikes up a bond with, and a relationship potentially. So for the rest of the film it's Drew and Claire socializing and making goo goo eyes while dealing with his dad's death and also the upcoming news story about his soon-to-be legendary bomb.Drew mentions in the voice-over that disappears really quickly throughout the rest of the film that there's a difference between a failure and a fiasco. Looking at the film, it's hard to tell which one the film is although you know it's a disappointment. One misstep is in the music: instead of image and music going hand in hand, the music seems to be the rescuer when the image fails. And it's not a remarkable soundtrack either; every one of his films turned me onto a song. Here? Probably not.Then it's the casting. Kirsten Dunst is playing that too perfect girl who knows about everything, makes witty comments and one liners and knows a lot about music(and can apparently time to the T a road trip). And Orlando Bloom is kinda dull, as if he was trying to be an actor but he came across as sleepwalking. The supporting actors are a bit better but get very little screen time.Since it is a Cameron movie, you can expect some good moments and the film's got some. Drew and Claire's all night phone call(which oddly doesn't require batteries), Drew's road trip back home and an attack by a fake bird of all things during a performance of, appropriately, Free Bird.

What was the movie trying to say? Young man who loved and thought he knew his father discovers facets he never knew, thereby gaining greater perspective and understanding to handle his own problems?  Nope, that didn't happen. Young man from big city who had always thought his father's side of the family was corny and strange discovers a strong loving base from which he goes forth into the world once again? Nope, not that either. Young man putzes from scene to disjointed scene wondering why he's there? Yes, that's it!A few things were very hard for me to get my mind around: why were there no focus groups done on that shoe? How did Susan Sarandon fit all those classes into just three days, and how did it happen that they all started in that exact week that her husband died? How did Kirsten Dunst make that incredibly complex guidebook in just one day? How come Kirsten Dunst kept coming back after she said ""We peaked on the phone""??Bloom and Dunst's hours long phone call bored me, by the way, as did Susan Sarandon's long speech/dance, as did the pointless journey across America.

My wife and I watched this last night and from start to finish we truly loved it.  It's sweet and genuine and full of heart and soul and the performances by Dunst and Bloom are just pure and brilliant, especially on the part of Kirsten wh plays the perky flight attendant Claire.  Bloom plays Drew, a man in his early twenties who just singlehandedly destroyed the shoe company he worked for, costing them close to a billion dollars and getting himself fired by his boss Phill (Alec Baldwin) and simotaniously dumped by his girlfriend Ellen (Jessica Biel).  While attempting to commit suicide his sister calls him with terrible news.  His father has just died of a heart attack while visiting his family in Elizabethtown and Drew needs to go there and get the body since his mother (Susan Surandon) is a mess and can't possibly go herself.  So he puts his suicide plans on hold and makes the trip and thats when he meets Claire, who at first you can tell somewhat annoys him, but that annoyance sparks curiosity, and after spending and entire night talking on the phone with her his curiosity turns to infactuation.  This film is just beautifully done, with great scenery, great dialog, great acting and yes, as everyone has already stated, GREAT MUSIC.  The film just unfolds so well and keeps your interest throughout.  If your a fan of films like Garden State then this is a film for you.  It shows well how we need to find ourselves, love ourselves even in order to understand our lives and appreciate it for what it is.  The ending was beautiful mostly because I wasn't expecting it.  I won't tell you but just be prepared to smile big.  I have to say that I am not usually a fan of Orlando Bloom but he really impressed me here with his mature performance and even his comic delivery.  He was great, but yes, it was Kirsten who stole the show.  I think this is a great family film, a great film for fathers and sons to see the bond that should exist, hopefully before it's too late.  The scene where Drew is driving with his fathers urn strapped in the front seat and he talking to it is just beautiful.  It's a wonderful love story wrapped up in a great coming of age film that is sure to please.",5,"""You don't deserve to be anybody's substitute...""",1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,2253,"['one', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'delightful', 'wife', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'start', 'finish', 'truly', 'loved', 'sweet', 'genuine', 'full', 'heart', 'soul', 'performances', 'Dunst', 'Bloom', 'are', 'just', 'pure', 'brilliant', 'especially', 'part', 'Kirsten', 'perky', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'Drew', 'man', 'early', 'twenties', 'who', 'just', 'singlehandedly', 'destroyed', 'shoe', 'company', 'worked', 'costing', 'close', 'billion', 'dollars', 'getting', 'fired', 'boss', 'Phill', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'simotaniously', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'Ellen', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'attempting', 'commit', 'suicide', 'sister', 'terrible', 'news', 'father', 'just', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'visiting', 'family', 'Elizabethtown', 'Drew', 'go', 'there', 'get', 'body', 'mother', 'Susan', 'Surandon', 'mess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'go', 'So', 'suicide', 'plans', 'hold', 'trip', 'thats', 'when', 'Claire', 'who', 'first', 'can', 'tell', 'somewhat', 'annoyance', 'sparks', 'curiosity', 'spending', 'entire', 'night', 'talking', 'phone', 'curiosity', 'infactuation', 'film', 'just', 'beautifully', 'done', 'great', 'scenery', 'great', 'dialog', 'great', 'acting', 'yes', 'everyone', 'already', 'stated', 'GREAT', 'MUSIC', 'film', 'just', 'unfolds', 'so', 'well', 'keeps', 'interest', 'fan', 'films', 'Garden', 'State', 'then', 'film', 'well', 'how', 'need', 'find', 'love', 'even', 'order', 'understand', 'lives', 'appreciate', 'what', 'ending', 'was', 'beautiful', 'mostly', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'smile', 'big', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'really', 'impressed', 'here', 'mature', 'performance', 'even', 'comic', 'delivery', 'was', 'great', 'yes', 'was', 'Kirsten', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'think', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'fathers', 'sons', 'see', 'bond', 'should', 'exist', 'hopefully', 'too', 'late', 'scene', 'where', 'Drew', 'driving', 'fathers', 'urn', 'strapped', 'front', 'seat', 'talking', 'just', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'love', 'story', 'wrapped', 'up', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'sure', 'please']",N/A
170254,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1415719284,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 10]","Normally, you would have to drag me kicking and screaming to any movie featuring either Alec Baldwin or Susan Sarandon (let alone both of them), but I took a chance on Elizabethtown just so I could watch Kirsten Dunst (whom I now officially adore, by the way).  Count this among the good decisions I have made in life.  Elizabethtown is a surprisingly rich, sentimental, wonderful film.Am I crazy, or is Hollywood actually turning out some darn good movies in the last couple of years?  Not the big blockbusters, of course.  I'm talking about quirky little comedies and dramas that usually don't pay for themselves at the box office but do actually reflect something of intelligence and emotional meaning - films like Elizabethtown.  Yes, the last quarter of the film basically wanders off on its own (the perfectly ridiculous memorial service is exceedingly over-the-top) and dilutes the overall effectiveness of the story, but this is still a wonderful little film that actually has something to say about life and love.  As much as I liked the story, though, I'm not sure it would have worked at all without Kirsten Dunst.  Few actresses have the natural charm and power to brighten up even the darkest of days just by showing up, and it was Dunst's manic energy that really drew me into this whole story.Everyone makes mistakes - but only a handful make mistakes that cost their company almost one billion dollars.  Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) is one of that ill-fated number.  Who knew there was a billion dollars to be won or lost in the shoe business?  This fiasco is so big that Drew decides to kill himself.  His attempt is preempted, however, by a phone call carrying the news that his father has died while visiting his hometown friends and family.  Since Drew's mother and sister are a little on the loony side, it falls to Drew to travel to Kentucky to bring his father back home for the last time.  During his late-night plane trip, he meets an exceedingly helpful and more than a little manic flight attendant named Claire (Kirsten Dunst), who gives him all sorts of directions and, of course, her phone number.  After dealing with his father's family and friends all day, he ends up talking to Claire on the phone all night.  Thus is born a rather unusual relationship between these two ""substitute people.""  Claire provides Drew with an emotional base he sorely needs in dealing with his twin tragedies, and she also injects a spontaneity and zest for life into his otherwise morbid, pre-suicidal world.Elizabethtown does deal with some big themes - e.g., life and death, success and failure - and I think it all comes together wonderfully.  I can't really understand why some viewers see the film as being less than the sum of its parts, as there is definitely meaning to be found in this unusual story.  I especially can't see how anyone would view Claire as a shallow character; she has a magical quality that makes her infinitely complex and perfectly refreshing.  If you ask me, Dunst is amazingly good in this film.  Even the presence of Baldwin and Sarandon isn't enough for me to give Elizabethtown less than five stars.",5,Dunst is magical in this wonderful little film,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,3145,"['Normally', 'would', 'have', 'drag', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'let', 'alone', 'took', 'chance', 'Elizabethtown', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'watch', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'whom', 'now', 'officially', 'adore', 'way', 'Count', 'good', 'decisions', 'have', 'made', 'life', 'Elizabethtown', 'surprisingly', 'rich', 'sentimental', 'wonderful', 'film.Am', 'crazy', 'Hollywood', 'actually', 'turning', 'out', 'darn', 'good', 'movies', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'Not', 'big', 'blockbusters', 'course', ""'m"", 'talking', 'quirky', 'little', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'box', 'office', 'do', 'actually', 'reflect', 'something', 'intelligence', 'emotional', 'meaning', 'films', 'Elizabethtown', 'Yes', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'basically', 'off', 'own', 'perfectly', 'ridiculous', 'memorial', 'service', 'exceedingly', 'over-the-top', 'overall', 'effectiveness', 'story', 'still', 'wonderful', 'little', 'film', 'actually', 'something', 'say', 'life', 'love', 'As', 'much', 'liked', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Few', 'actresses', 'have', 'natural', 'charm', 'power', 'brighten', 'up', 'even', 'darkest', 'days', 'just', 'showing', 'up', 'was', 'Dunst', 'manic', 'energy', 'really', 'drew', 'whole', 'story.Everyone', 'mistakes', 'only', 'handful', 'make', 'mistakes', 'cost', 'company', 'almost', 'one', 'billion', 'dollars', 'Drew', 'Baylor', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'one', 'ill-fated', 'number', 'Who', 'knew', 'was', 'billion', 'dollars', 'be', 'won', 'lost', 'shoe', 'business', 'fiasco', 'so', 'big', 'Drew', 'kill', 'attempt', 'preempted', 'however', 'phone', 'call', 'carrying', 'news', 'father', 'died', 'visiting', 'hometown', 'friends', 'family', 'Drew', 'mother', 'sister', 'are', 'little', 'loony', 'side', 'Drew', 'travel', 'Kentucky', 'bring', 'father', 'back', 'home', 'last', 'time', 'late-night', 'plane', 'trip', 'exceedingly', 'helpful', 'more', 'little', 'manic', 'flight', 'attendant', 'named', 'Claire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'sorts', 'directions', 'course', 'phone', 'number', 'dealing', 'father', 'family', 'friends', 'day', 'up', 'talking', 'Claire', 'phone', 'night', 'Thus', 'born', 'rather', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'two', 'substitute', 'people', 'Claire', 'Drew', 'emotional', 'base', 'sorely', 'dealing', 'twin', 'tragedies', 'also', 'spontaneity', 'zest', 'life', 'otherwise', 'morbid', 'pre-suicidal', 'world.Elizabethtown', 'deal', 'big', 'themes', 'e.g.', 'life', 'death', 'success', 'failure', 'think', 'together', 'wonderfully', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'viewers', 'see', 'film', 'being', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'definitely', 'meaning', 'be', 'found', 'unusual', 'story', 'especially', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'would', 'view', 'Claire', 'shallow', 'character', 'magical', 'quality', 'infinitely', 'complex', 'perfectly', 'refreshing', 'ask', 'Dunst', 'amazingly', 'good', 'film', 'Even', 'presence', 'Baldwin', 'Sarandon', ""n't"", 'enough', 'give', 'Elizabethtown', 'less', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

The plot is almost a direct rip off of his previous movie, Jerry Maguire:  Guy has nice job, loses nice job, gets depressed, finds girl to change said depression.2.  The acting is barely worth noticing.  Orlando Bloom does not make for a good narrative voice.  Kirsten Dunst was trying so hard to be quirky that she loses all appeal.3.  The emotion was not there.  We are supposed to feel sorry for Orlando Blooms character (I actually can't remember his charcters name) but he conveys nothing that allows me to feel sorry for him.AND THIS IS IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM4.  The music.  He has never failed to deliver a great soundtrack in the past with each and every movie he released, but the problem with this one is that he tried to build a movie around the soundtrack instead of vice versa.  He misuses the songs that he chooses and he overuses songs altogether.  What he attempted to do was to evoke an emotion by inserting a song into a scene.  This doesn't work if the scene doesn't work.  What made his other movies so great was he allowed the music to reinforce the emotion of a scene, but what he has done here is tried to make the music the only emotion there, which doesn't have as much of an impact.Three Tom Petty songs is too many for one movie (and I love Tom Petty).  Two Ryan Adams song is also too many for one movie.  If you oversaturate a movie with music, then it starts to lose all its luster.  Cameron Crowe didn't trust his actors to deliver the emotion so he relied on the music.4(a).  The music he didn't use.  During the road trip part of the movie the viewer gets to see part of the song list that he is listening to.  The list included songs by:  Red House Painters, Sun Kil Moon and Nick Cave just to name a few, but we never hear these songs anywhere in the movie.  Hey Cameron, couldn't you have replaced just on Tom Petty song with a Sun Kil Moon song?  Salvador Sanchez is a great song and it was on the playlist, so why didn't you use it?  Did you not trust the listeners to appreciate that type of song?I guess what I'm saying is, this movie didn't work for me.",2,A disasterous misuse of songs,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2267,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'read', 'review', 'vanilla', 'sky', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', '.Now', 'let', 'tell', 'why', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.1', 'plot', 'almost', 'direct', 'rip', 'previous', 'movie', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Guy', 'nice', 'job', 'nice', 'job', 'depressed', 'girl', 'change', 'said', 'depression.2', 'acting', 'barely', 'worth', 'noticing', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'narrative', 'voice', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'was', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'quirky', 'appeal.3', 'emotion', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Orlando', 'Blooms', 'character', 'actually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'charcters', 'name', 'nothing', 'feel', 'sorry', 'him.AND', 'THIS', 'THE', 'BIGGEST', 'PROBLEM4', 'music', 'never', 'failed', 'deliver', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'past', 'movie', 'released', 'problem', 'one', 'tried', 'build', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'instead', 'vice', 'versa', 'songs', 'songs', 'altogether', 'What', 'attempted', 'do', 'was', 'evoke', 'emotion', 'inserting', 'song', 'scene', ""n't"", 'work', 'scene', ""n't"", 'work', 'What', 'made', 'other', 'movies', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'allowed', 'music', 'reinforce', 'emotion', 'scene', 'what', 'done', 'here', 'tried', 'make', 'music', 'only', 'emotion', 'there', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'impact.Three', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'songs', 'too', 'many', 'one', 'movie', 'love', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Two', 'Ryan', 'Adams', 'song', 'also', 'too', 'many', 'one', 'movie', 'oversaturate', 'movie', 'music', 'then', 'lose', 'luster', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'actors', 'deliver', 'emotion', 'relied', 'music.4', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'road', 'trip', 'part', 'movie', 'viewer', 'see', 'part', 'song', 'list', 'listening', 'list', 'included', 'songs', 'Red', 'House', 'Painters', 'Sun', 'Kil', 'Moon', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'never', 'hear', 'songs', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'Hey', 'Cameron', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'replaced', 'just', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'song', 'Sun', 'Kil', 'Moon', 'song', 'Salvador', 'Sanchez', 'great', 'song', 'was', 'playlist', 'so', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'Did', 'not', 'trust', 'listeners', 'appreciate', 'type', 'song', 'guess', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'work']",N/A

170260,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,1415719284,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 9]","Critics have been lambasting director-screenwriter Cameron Crowe's latest picture right and left, and I can understand some of the derision given the conceits of some of the plot contrivances. However, I was mostly charmed by the personal odyssey of Drew Baylor, a shoe designer at a Nike-look-alike company who has fallen from his golden boy status due to a $1B marketing fiasco. Even though it bears some striking similarities to Zach Braff's recent ""Garden State"" in approach (including a near-catatonic protagonist at the outset), Crowe bears his unmistakable stamp with an organic use of often obscure music, an episodic story structure that ties random plot strands together emotionally and a keen eye on characterization. Those looking for logic have been forewarned.Nonetheless, casting is a bit problematic to Crowe. An ill-chosen Orlando Bloom plays the role in such a by-the-numbers manner that I kept thinking how a younger John Cusack or a time-capsuled Jack Lemmon could have added a sense of nuance and true angst to the conflicted, emotionally drained Drew. It's not so much that Bloom torpedoes the film, it's just that he doesn't fulfill what could have been an archetypal American movie hero for the new millennium. Part of the problem is that Bloom overcompensates for his crafted American accent by over-enunciating his voiceover narration. He also seems a bit more at sea than his character should be when surrounded by his down-home relatives.But when the movie focuses on the love story, Bloom comes to life, and it's really because of Kirsten Dunst, who brings a genuine effervescence to the film as Claire. Initially, her bubbly, motor-mouthed flight attendant threatens to overwhelm the story and the inevitable relationship, but she delivers improbable lines like the soon-to-be-unavoidable ""I'm impossible to forget but hard to remember"" with convincing aplomb. Even as she is scooping kitty poop out of a litter box or directing people out of a smoke-filled ballroom in a manner true to her profession, Dunst imbues her lighter-than-air character with an incandescence that is truly hard for anyone to resist.The two actors have palpable chemistry, especially during lengthy dialogue-driven scenes such as their all-night cell-phone interchange (a wonderfully edited piece on its own) or when she talks of Drew and herself as ""substitute people"". During these moments, there is a well-earned poignancy that Crowe obviously intended. Concurrent to the will-they-or-won't-they romance is the small-town Kentucky family reunion plot catalyzed by the sudden death of Drew's father. Already suicidal from his professional disaster, Drew is ill-equipped to handle complications on the home front with a mother falling apart through hyperactivity and a sister who regales on being put upon. Susan Sarandon plays the mother with her usual finesse and shines during an impromptu comedy and tap dance routine at her husband's memorial service.The rest of the cast is underused, and characters seem strangely elliptical as a result - Judy Greer as endlessly whining sister Heather; Jessica Biel (in an unflattering Farrah hairdo) as Drew's icy, co-worker girlfriend Ellen; Bruce McGill as black-sheep family friend Bill Banyon; the Food Network's Paula Deen as photo-loving Aunt Dora (of course, constantly in the kitchen) and Paul Schneider as mullet-headed, Lynard Skynard-loving cousin Jessie. The chief exception is a seething cameo by Alec Baldwin as the shoe company magnate who fires Drew. It all ends with Drew - with his father's ashes in tow - taking an elaborate road trip engineered by Claire with a scrapbook complete with location-appropriate music recorded on mix CDs, as well as geographic, culinary and historic insights on various post-its.

I'm not quite sure why the critics didn't like this movie. I found it to be quite an enjoyable experience personally. I'm a bit predisposed to liking a Cameron Crowe movie I think, because I like him a lot as a filmmaker and as a personality. I was one of the few defenders of Crowe's previous movie, Vanilla Sky. It has a lot of good reviews here on Amazon, however a lot of the people I know passionately loathed Vanilla Sky with its romance-turned-science fiction premise and headache-inducing twists. So it seems to me that Cameron Crowe's movies are hit or miss with most people. Crowe does have one bona fide masterpiece to his name, though. His most personal movie, Almost Famous. Nothing else he does will probably ever compare that wonderful, wonderful movie however he has earned my unwavering admiration for life. Now, simply because he made Almost Famous, I will see any movie he does. That leads me to his latest, Elizabethtown.Cameron Crowe's movies are interesting in that they're like mixtapes you make to give to friends. Compile a bunch of your favorite songs together and hope that it tells other people something about you. Well, Crowe takes a bunch of songs and puts them together, however he adds images with characters and dialog as well. Elizabethtown deals with a young man (Orlando Bloom) who seems himself as a failure and intends to commit suicide upon returning back home from his deceased father's hometown of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. En route, he meets an energetic rambling girl (Kirsten Dunst) and learns a few things about family and life. That's really oversimplifying it, but I don't want to get into too much detail. I'll just say that Elizabethtown is filled with the same sort of observations about life and love that made Almost Famous so special, although it doesn't compare to that great movie. It features the well-developed characters you would expect from Crowe and his wonderful dialog as well. The performances are quite good. I was surprised how well Orlando Bloom did. He won't be winning any awards, but he does quite well. Kirsten Dunst's character is a little bit irritating at first with her constant chitchat, but she grows on you just as she grows on Drew, Orlando Bloom's character. She doesn't quite convincingly pull off a southern accent though. One thing you know you'll get from a Cameron Crowe movie is a great soundtrack. Once again, Crowe uses music to excellent effect in Elizabethtown. Tom Petty, Lindsey Buckingham, Ryan Adams, The Hollies, the music is always interesting. Tom Petty's Learning to Fly and Elton John's My Father's Gun stick out the most in my mind. Just like Claire in the movie, Crowe finds just the right song for the right scene.It's not a perfect movie, sure. It does have its share of flaws. It's a little bit too long and the performances aren't always top-notch. However, overall I found the movie to be a funny, joyous, warmhearted journey with much to say about life, death, the human spirit and the important role that music plays in our lives.",4,A very underrated movie,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,3127,"['right', 'now', 'Elizabethtown', 'only', '28-percent', 'positive', 'rating', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'personally', ""'m"", 'bit', 'predisposed', 'liking', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'movie', 'think', 'like', 'lot', 'filmmaker', 'personality', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'defenders', 'Crowe', 'previous', 'movie', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'lot', 'good', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'however', 'lot', 'people', 'know', 'passionately', 'loathed', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'romance-turned-science', 'fiction', 'premise', 'headache-inducing', 'twists', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'movies', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'most', 'people', 'Crowe', 'have', 'one', 'bona', 'fide', 'masterpiece', 'name', 'though', 'most', 'personal', 'movie', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Nothing', 'else', 'will', 'probably', 'ever', 'compare', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'however', 'earned', 'unwavering', 'admiration', 'life', 'Now', 'simply', 'made', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'latest', 'Elizabethtown.Cameron', 'Crowe', 'movies', 'are', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'mixtapes', 'make', 'give', 'friends', 'Compile', 'bunch', 'favorite', 'songs', 'together', 'hope', 'other', 'people', 'something', 'Well', 'Crowe', 'bunch', 'songs', 'together', 'however', 'images', 'characters', 'dialog', 'as', 'well', 'Elizabethtown', 'deals', 'young', 'man', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'who', 'failure', 'commit', 'suicide', 'returning', 'back', 'home', 'deceased', 'father', 'hometown', 'Elizabethtown', 'Kentucky', 'En', 'route', 'energetic', 'rambling', 'girl', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'few', 'things', 'family', 'life', 'really', 'oversimplifying', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'detail', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'Elizabethtown', 'filled', 'same', 'sort', 'observations', 'life', 'love', 'made', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'special', ""n't"", 'compare', 'great', 'movie', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'would', 'expect', 'Crowe', 'wonderful', 'dialog', 'as', 'well', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'did', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'winning', 'awards', 'quite', 'well', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'character', 'little', 'bit', 'irritating', 'first', 'constant', 'chitchat', 'just', 'Drew', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'character', ""n't"", 'quite', 'convincingly', 'pull', 'off', 'southern', 'accent', 'One', 'thing', 'know', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'movie', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Once', 'again', 'Crowe', 'music', 'excellent', 'effect', 'Elizabethtown', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Lindsey', 'Buckingham', 'Ryan', 'Adams', 'Hollies', 'music', 'always', 'interesting', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Learning', 'Fly', 'Elton', 'John', 'My', 'Father', 'Gun', 'out', 'most', 'mind', 'Just', 'Claire', 'movie', 'Crowe', 'just', 'right', 'song', 'right', 'scene.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'sure', 'have', 'share', 'flaws', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'top-notch', 'However', 'overall', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'funny', 'joyous', 'warmhearted', 'journey', 'much', 'say', 'life', 'death', 'human', 'spirit', 'important', 'role', 'music', 'plays', 'lives']",N/A

When he, grudgingly, picks it up he finds out that his father, Mitch, has passed away from a heart attack. He is the oldest, he must take care of it. What follows is a quest to Elizabethtown, Kentucky to convince his relatives and friends of his relatives (which consists of the entire town) that he must be cremated.En route he meets Claire Colburn who systematically becomes the cheerful catalyst in which his eyes begin to open to a whole new world of existing. With Claire and the family he never got to knew Drew begins a life changing few days. This film makes us laugh at death, smile at loss, and cheer for life and love.

Didn't see it in the theaters, but watching this little film on DVD makes this viewer wonder just why the movie was so poorly received.  Yes, it is lengthy (over two hours) for a story that is fairly slight, and yes, it is a bit self indulgent even for writer director Cameron Crowe, and it is true the script is odd and patchy and contains big dollops of mushy philosophy.  But given all that, if you take your time and relax your expectations, this is a nice little film with many good things going for it.Drew (Orlando Bloom) is a bright and successful designer who has spent the last eight years of his life designing the Spasmodic show for a big Oregon firm led by Alec Baldwin.  But the shoe is a bust, costs the company nearly a billion dollars, and costs Drew his job.  Simultaneously his girlfriend dumps him and Drew finds himself on a machine design for suicide - when the phone rings and his sister informs him his father just died while he was in his hometown of Elizabethtoen, Kentucky.  As the eldest Drew must go make the arrangements.Drew books a flight on an empty airline with only the stewardess as companion - the kooky but funny and very sweet Claire (Kirsten Dunst)  who begins a long conversation about names, Drew's life, her life, etc. When Drew lands in Louisville he thinks he is saying goodbye (""I'm good at remembering goodbye looks"") to Claire, but in reality Claire follows Drew through his time in Elizabethtown and eventually assists him in rethinking and rediscovering the true meaning of success and happiness in a road trip that follows the funeral.  The townsfolk of Elizabethtown are a warm and oddball crew who awaken in Drew an appreciation for his father, memories dormant and set aside for the sake of his own misbegotten success.  The town loved his father and it is only after Drew convinces his sister (Judy Greer) and mother (Susan Sarandon) to come to Elizabethtown for the memorial service to end all memorial services that Drew can begin his own Claire-designed road trip with father's ashes that the whole story takes on some meaning.With some judicious pruning of a script constipated by verbiage or lazy phrases and with a bit of editing and fleshing out of some of the characters, this little non-pretentious story might have just become that - unpretentious.  But Cameron Crowe is Cameron Crowe for all that, and accepting his style is necessary to sit back and have a nice little evening with these nice folks.

Dauria ""daurigl""","[4, 7]","Some of the criticism that Elizabethtown is receiving may be on target, but does it really lack the fundamental elements that comprise a decent movie?  The most common critical remarks are that the movie lacks continuity and a clear plot; that too much material is compressed into an entertainment vehicle that cannot effectively deliver the goods.  Indeed, it is hard to find a critical element of life that is not touched upon.  There are:  loss of prestigious job; the death of a parent; loss of a love interest; nuclear and extended family interaction, community pressure, civil rights, and the establishment of a relationship that holds the potential to successfully guide the main character through such adversities and beyond.In defense of the movie, life is not one well thought out superbly edited script that has seamless dissolves between daily interactions.  If a movie hints of such chaos, is it poorly edited, or does the director feel the audience may want to connect the dots on their own without a lot of explanation, or forced interpretation?  There are scenes in the movie that seem superfluous to the plot and have been used as examples of directorial flaws.  While such scenes may seem initially out of place and a distraction at best, if they provoke thought about their possible relevance to the movie, then what is the harm? A common example is Susan Sarandon's character's behavior following the death of her husband, most notably the tap dancing routine at his memorial service.  However, bereavement is not a simple emotion that will be uniformly expressed by all individuals.  I doubt if any individual knows exactly how they will react when a calamity befalls them.If you are a romantic, this movie is going to do well by you; if you are pragmatic, then it will be easy to find fault with the movie.  Personally, I very much enjoyed it, and the fact that my wife just said that I would defend anything that Kirsten Dunst is in......well, just like the movie, that remark is open for discussion.",4,"Room for improvement, but enjoyable overall",1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2023,"['criticism', 'Elizabethtown', 'receiving', 'may', 'be', 'target', 'really', 'fundamental', 'elements', 'comprise', 'decent', 'movie', 'most', 'common', 'critical', 'remarks', 'are', 'movie', 'continuity', 'clear', 'plot', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'compressed', 'entertainment', 'vehicle', 'can', 'not', 'effectively', 'deliver', 'goods', 'Indeed', 'hard', 'find', 'critical', 'element', 'life', 'not', 'touched', 'upon', 'are', 'loss', 'prestigious', 'job', 'death', 'parent', 'loss', 'love', 'interest', 'nuclear', 'extended', 'family', 'interaction', 'community', 'pressure', 'civil', 'rights', 'establishment', 'relationship', 'potential', 'successfully', 'guide', 'main', 'character', 'such', 'adversities', 'beyond.In', 'defense', 'movie', 'life', 'not', 'one', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'superbly', 'edited', 'script', 'seamless', 'dissolves', 'daily', 'interactions', 'movie', 'hints', 'such', 'chaos', 'poorly', 'edited', 'director', 'feel', 'audience', 'may', 'want', 'connect', 'dots', 'own', 'lot', 'explanation', 'forced', 'interpretation', 'are', 'scenes', 'movie', 'seem', 'superfluous', 'plot', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'examples', 'directorial', 'flaws', 'such', 'scenes', 'may', 'seem', 'initially', 'place', 'distraction', 'best', 'provoke', 'thought', 'possible', 'relevance', 'movie', 'then', 'what', 'harm', 'common', 'example', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'character', 'behavior', 'following', 'death', 'husband', 'most', 'notably', 'tap', 'dancing', 'routine', 'memorial', 'service', 'However', 'bereavement', 'not', 'simple', 'emotion', 'will', 'be', 'uniformly', 'expressed', 'individuals', 'doubt', 'individual', 'knows', 'exactly', 'how', 'will', 'react', 'when', 'calamity', 'are', 'romantic', 'movie', 'going', 'do', 'well', 'are', 'pragmatic', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'find', 'fault', 'movie', 'Personally', 'very', 'much', 'fact', 'wife', 'just', 'said', 'would', 'defend', 'anything', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'well', 'just', 'movie', 'remark', 'open', 'discussion']",N/A

It's written in a way that the viewer becomes entangled into the emotions of the characters--something a lot of movies have trouble doing.Now, perhaps I was just in the right mood to see a movie like this when I viewed it, but that doesn't change my opinion that this is a well-crafted movie that doesn't at all deserve the terrible reviews it's been getting.Another thing--no, this is not Almost Famous, nor is it meant to be. Almost Famous is my favorite movie of all time, but it's a fun, imaginative story from the perspective of a 15 year old kid.

He seems to think these characters are quaint, clever, and interesting.  They aren't.  Instead, they ramble around spewing cereal box philosophies unaware that no one should care about a thing they have to say. Not to mention the fact that Orlando Bloom is awful in the film.  When your lead (and male leads in Crowe films carry nearly ALL the weight) is this bad, the movie doesn't stand a chance.  He's actually worse than Kirsten Dunce, which says a lot.

170277,A385C064Y38OFK,1415719284,"John Dagley ""RonHowardFan@hotmail.com""","[8, 10]","Unlike many Hollywood directors these days more intent on constantly bringing out the latest films on a yearly basis, sometimes even two films a year. There are a few who, once finished the arduious task of completing films, take about three years off to enjoy themselves and their newest creations. One man who falls into this category is Cameron Crowe, who's last endevour was 'Vanilla Sky', with Tom Cruise, who worked with Cameron also previously on 'Jerry McGuire'. Tom Cruise now acts as a producer for him and his latest movie offering with good results.In the year 2000, Cameron took Kate Hudson, and made her famous with 'Almost Famous'. While Kate had wanted a part in the 'Spider-Man' films directed by Sam Rami, she missed out, and it went to Kirsten Dunst.Now Cameron Crowe takes two phenomenonly successful actors Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst and pairs them together for the very first time. For both actors 'Elizabethtown' could be seen as a smaller film then they have been used to in the past, so I'm sure this fact derived a lot of joy for the dynamic duo. After all the scheduling issues with Orlando and his 'Kingdom Of Heaven', and Kirsten Dunst escaping 'The Village' so Bryce Dallas Howard could enter the world of acting, both have made a tremendous effort with this film, that really pays off. While this movie does feel like a rehash of 2004's 'Garden State', with Zack Brah and Natalie Portman it is its own film and so should be kept seperate. To me, 'Garden State' is more of a writing exercise for a first-time director which it is. It is not so for accomplished director Cameron Crowe. This film is also a lot more upbeat then 'Garden State', but both have wonderful leading ladies. So there's something both going for them.Kirsten Dunst plays a flight attendant who latches onto Orlando Bloom the second she lays eyes on him, who's coming home to decide his dead father's burial arrangements. An accord soon transpires between them and it isn't long before they are spending long sleepless evenings merely chatting over the telephone as if they inhabited the same room. This interaction to me was a fascinating aspect of this film. The apparent distance between people, and yet there is a real closeness shared here between these two stangers, that transends the distance to find something in common, which we are all capable of while inhabiting, and sharing, this big round globe called Earth with other people. I also find a link between email and the easiness people can shoot off electronic mail, and a telephone. Both methods of communication need no eye contact so we can be braver then usual then standing face to face.While I did enjoy the ease of the conversations over the telephone, it was enlightening to see when they do meet up again after their brief interaction on board an aeroplane that the spark between them doesn't diminish, but only intensifies. No one is out to sabotage this bond they share, and it is a refreshing change to other films. Like travel, these characters exist in the moment, and embrace what they have and who they're with knowing it could all end at any time.  So they just enjoy it.At no time did I ever feel the film was disconnected. I love the title of this film and remember my friend Elizabeth from school, much like the fleeting nature of Kirsten and Orlando's characters, knowing the years we had together were special, and knowing we did everything we could in the time we had together. So I take something personal away with me from this film from my past. Yet with the travelling nature of this film who knows where it will lead us all. You can't find something this special on any map. I'm not a really kean flyer, so I can't imagine spending a trip with anyone better then Kirsten Dunst or Orlando Bloom. So to me 'Elizabethtown' will always be a memorable trip worth taking.",5,You wont find a trip like this on any road map so share it with someone you love and see where your heart takes you,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,3862,"['many', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'days', 'more', 'intent', 'constantly', 'bringing', 'out', 'latest', 'films', 'yearly', 'basis', 'sometimes', 'even', 'two', 'films', 'year', 'are', 'few', 'who', 'once', 'finished', 'arduious', 'task', 'completing', 'films', 'take', 'three', 'years', 'enjoy', 'newest', 'creations', 'One', 'man', 'who', 'category', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'who', 'last', 'endevour', 'was', ""'Vanilla"", 'Sky', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'worked', 'Cameron', 'also', 'previously', ""'Jerry"", 'McGuire', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'now', 'producer', 'latest', 'movie', 'offering', 'good', 'results.In', 'year', '2000', 'Cameron', 'took', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'made', 'famous', 'Famous', 'Kate', 'had', 'wanted', 'part', ""'Spider-Man"", 'films', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Rami', 'missed', 'out', 'went', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst.Now', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'two', 'phenomenonly', 'successful', 'actors', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'pairs', 'together', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'actors', ""'Elizabethtown"", 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'smaller', 'film', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'past', ""'m"", 'sure', 'fact', 'derived', 'lot', 'joy', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'scheduling', 'issues', 'Orlando', ""'Kingdom"", 'Heaven', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'escaping', ""'The"", 'Village', 'so', 'Bryce', 'Dallas', 'Howard', 'could', 'enter', 'world', 'acting', 'have', 'made', 'tremendous', 'effort', 'film', 'really', 'off', 'movie', 'feel', 'rehash', '2004', ""'Garden"", 'State', 'Zack', 'Brah', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'own', 'film', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'seperate', 'State', 'more', 'writing', 'exercise', 'first-time', 'director', 'not', 'so', 'accomplished', 'director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'upbeat', 'then', 'State', 'have', 'wonderful', 'leading', 'ladies', 'something', 'going', 'them.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'flight', 'attendant', 'who', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'second', 'eyes', 'who', 'coming', 'home', 'decide', 'dead', 'father', 'burial', 'arrangements', 'accord', 'soon', 'transpires', ""n't"", 'long', 'are', 'spending', 'long', 'sleepless', 'evenings', 'merely', 'chatting', 'telephone', 'inhabited', 'same', 'room', 'interaction', 'was', 'fascinating', 'aspect', 'film', 'apparent', 'distance', 'people', 'yet', 'real', 'closeness', 'shared', 'here', 'two', 'stangers', 'distance', 'find', 'something', 'common', 'are', 'capable', 'inhabiting', 'sharing', 'big', 'round', 'globe', 'called', 'Earth', 'other', 'people', 'also', 'find', 'link', 'email', 'easiness', 'people', 'can', 'shoot', 'off', 'electronic', 'mail', 'telephone', 'methods', 'communication', 'need', 'eye', 'contact', 'can', 'be', 'braver', 'then', 'usual', 'then', 'standing', 'face', 'face.While', 'did', 'enjoy', 'ease', 'conversations', 'telephone', 'was', 'enlightening', 'see', 'when', 'do', 'meet', 'up', 'again', 'brief', 'interaction', 'board', 'aeroplane', 'spark', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'only', 'intensifies', 'one', 'out', 'sabotage', 'bond', 'share', 'refreshing', 'change', 'other', 'films', 'travel', 'characters', 'exist', 'moment', 'embrace', 'what', 'have', 'who', ""'re"", 'knowing', 'could', 'all', 'end', 'time', 'just', 'enjoy', 'it.At', 'time', 'did', 'ever', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'disconnected', 'love', 'title', 'film', 'remember', 'friend', 'Elizabeth', 'school', 'much', 'fleeting', 'nature', 'Kirsten', 'Orlando', 'characters', 'knowing', 'years', 'had', 'together', 'were', 'special', 'knowing', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'time', 'had', 'together', 'take', 'something', 'personal', 'away', 'film', 'past', 'travelling', 'nature', 'film', 'who', 'where', 'will', 'lead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'something', 'special', 'map', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'kean', 'flyer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'spending', 'trip', 'anyone', 'better', 'then', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'So', ""'Elizabethtown"", 'will', 'always', 'be', 'memorable', 'trip', 'worth', 'taking']",N/A

170279,A356HRZZFCEGL1,1415719284,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[0, 0]","Even for critics disparaging this movie, I would imagine that one of their favorite ""Elizabethtown"" highlights is the Construction Worker Rusty How-to Video Drew shows to his cousin's unruly son Samson and other family children at yet another family gathering. Rusty holds the children spellbound as he dynamites the house from three different angles. After demolishing the house, Rusty says: ""Now, let's rebuild!"" Of course, this humorous scene is a metaphor for Drew's (Orlando Bloom's) life and the connecting theme of ""Elizabethtown"".I believe many of the movie's detractors are dissatisfied because the movie does not employ the ancient theme of ""fall and rise"" in a typically frenetic, high-volume, slapstick, stereotypical fashion, as it easily could have been. Instead, ""Elizabethtown"" charts Drew's journey of self-discovery and yes, salvation, at a deliberate, thoughtful pace. Deliberation, pensiveness, and contemplation bore some people all the time. You know whether you're that kind of person or not. But if you consciously allow yourself to submit to the movie's languorously winding rhythms, you may find yourself surprisingly comforted and reinvigorated, as I was.To re-emphasize, ""Elizabethtown"" is not tremendously original, with its disgraced executive, funeral crisis, whimsical stewardess savior, and somewhat strange (but not too corn-pone or Mayberry-like) southern relatives. However, the movie has a USA-sized heart and pleasant affection for all of the characters and gives Drew the time and breathing space to re-prioritize and learn what to really cherish in life. Drew's late father's mantra was ""If it wasn't this, it would have been something else"", an aphorism I have been using a lot lately. Yet, it is not an empty one, because it instructs Drew, and the audience, that tragedies and crises are inevitable and that how we handle adversity truly defines how we are. For example, Drew's dad's widowed mother (Susan Sarandon) handles her grief by keeping busy with new projects. At first, she comes across as a bit of a basket case wacko, but eventually her strategy pays off; she fixes the toilet and delivers a killer (no pun intended) eulogy that reconciles the black sheep ""Californian"" Drew to her Kentucky in-laws. For Drew, dealing with the relatives and family, the funeral preparations, and the ubiquitous Claire (Kirsten Dunst) helps him cope with his losses (material and personal).The unorthodox Drew-Claire courtship and yet another plot staple, the ""Cross Country Journey"", help Drew heal even more. I appreciated that Orlando Bloom did not portray Drew as the clich&eacute;d heartless business go-getter with no principles, but as an ambitious young man who has just misplaced his values a little. ""Elizabethtown"" is not supposed to be a roller-coaster ride to new-found wealth that makes things materialistically better, but a leisurely bus ride (or in this case, car trip) to catharsis, redemption, peace of mind, and of course, love with kooky angel Claire.One more thought: ""Elizabethtown""'s theme, strangely enough, reminds me of the final section of ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"". Remember when Charlie lost the national spelling bee and vowed to remain in bed for the rest of his life. Linus visits him and essentially tells him that the loss is a letdown, but that the world did not come to an end.

It was going nowhere faster that the trip down Route 60B in Kentucky.I can,in recent memory, recall only one other film that presented so many themes, ideas and characters and failed to develop a single one of them.Well, ELIZABETHTOWN from Cameron Crowe is this latest detour and dead end.To recap this  ridiculous film would be pure mayhem.What is it truly about? Who knows! Where is the film going? Everywhere and nowhere! This film simply fails to connect point A to point B at any level.It is insufferably overlong and could have ended so many times that after a while I just wanted to get to the end so that I could say I completed the trip!!! I did and the vacation simply was not worth it.The film's flaws seemed to be covered effectively by an excellent and diverse melange of rock and country tunes that run practically the entire length of the film.Folks will be apt to  purchase the soundtrack far quicker that this botched mess of a movie!Orlando Bloom is soooooo wasted in this film that it makes me angry that talent and looks should be squandered in such a misguided screenplay.Kirsten Dunst is the only character that has some kind of substance and Dunst does all that she can to make her role real.Susan Sarandon appeared ridiculous. These three actors more than likely hung their heads when they viewed the finished product.Whether the chief problem with this film is the screenplay or the direction, rest assured that Cameron Crowe did them both.After ALMOST FAMOUS how did Crowe allow this debacle to hit the screen?In conclusion, this film is about family connection,dealing with failure,connecting with the right person,living life to it's fullest,dealing with grief and loss,learning to soar,how to ineffectively commit suicide and how to drive 42 hours with a cd/scrapbook-road guide so skillfully assembled in a four day period by Kirsten Dunst that would take AAA years to put together.Ultimately though, this film is about none of these things.Each theme is roadblocked;each character is under construction;and the entire film needed an alternate route to travel to get itself and the cast out of critical harms way!",1,ELIZABETHTOWN: A film that does not know what it is or where it is going!,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,2215,"['Fifteen', 'minutes', 'ELIZABETHTOWN', 'knew', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'trouble', 'was', 'going', 'nowhere', 'faster', 'trip', 'Route', '60B', 'Kentucky.I', 'can', 'recent', 'memory', 'recall', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'presented', 'so', 'many', 'themes', 'ideas', 'characters', 'failed', 'develop', 'single', 'one', 'them.Well', 'ELIZABETHTOWN', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'latest', 'detour', 'dead', 'end.To', 'recap', 'ridiculous', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'pure', 'mayhem.What', 'truly', 'Who', 'Where', 'film', 'going', 'Everywhere', 'nowhere', 'film', 'simply', 'connect', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'level.It', 'insufferably', 'overlong', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'while', 'just', 'wanted', 'get', 'end', 'could', 'say', 'completed', 'trip', 'did', 'vacation', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'it.The', 'film', 'flaws', 'seemed', 'be', 'covered', 'effectively', 'excellent', 'diverse', 'melange', 'rock', 'country', 'tunes', 'run', 'practically', 'entire', 'length', 'film.Folks', 'will', 'be', 'apt', 'purchase', 'soundtrack', 'far', 'botched', 'mess', 'movie', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'soooooo', 'wasted', 'film', 'angry', 'talent', 'should', 'be', 'squandered', 'such', 'misguided', 'screenplay.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'only', 'character', 'kind', 'substance', 'Dunst', 'can', 'make', 'role', 'real.Susan', 'Sarandon', 'appeared', 'ridiculous', 'three', 'actors', 'more', 'likely', 'hung', 'heads', 'when', 'viewed', 'finished', 'chief', 'problem', 'film', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'rest', 'assured', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'did', 'both.After', 'ALMOST', 'FAMOUS', 'how', 'did', 'Crowe', 'allow', 'debacle', 'hit', 'screen', 'conclusion', 'film', 'family', 'connection', 'dealing', 'failure', 'connecting', 'right', 'person', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'dealing', 'grief', 'loss', 'learning', 'soar', 'how', 'ineffectively', 'commit', 'suicide', 'how', 'drive', '42', 'hours', 'cd/scrapbook-road', 'guide', 'so', 'skillfully', 'assembled', 'four', 'day', 'period', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'would', 'take', 'AAA', 'years', 'put', 'together.Ultimately', 'film', 'none', 'things.Each', 'theme', 'roadblocked', 'character', 'construction', 'entire', 'film', 'needed', 'alternate', 'route', 'travel', 'get', 'cast', 'critical', 'harms', 'way']",N/A
170285,A6ADO7B6FUVN,1415719284,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 4]","The rumors of Elizabethtown's dreadfulness have reached my ears, and it intrigued me more than bothered me. Some of the fascination stemmed from how poorly received the film was at the Toronto Film Festival in 2005, which only fueled the negative buzz around the film.  The buzz triggered my curiosity to experience Cameron Crowe's film, which now has been shortened by approximately a quarter of an hour.  Crowe's previous films such as Almost Famous (2000) and Jerry Maguire (1996) also stimulate desire to see them.  These reports of the film might have slightly lessened my expectations, but in retrospect, knowing what Crowe is capable of I must bring forth the analogy of the flavors of Jelly Beans.  Jelly Beans exist in a large number of different flavors and occasionally I buy these in a wide assortment of flavors.  Once the intake begins, there are surprises ranging from exotically delicious to vulgarly nasty, yet it is only flavored sugar.The story within Elizabethtown centers on the once successful sport shoe designer Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) learning the lesson of supreme failure.  Drew's efforts to create the ultimate footwear have backfired, as almost every single pair returns to the manufacturer.  It is an expensive fiasco, as it will cost the company a total of 972 million dollars and tarnish the company name.  Without anyone to lean on, Drew withdraws and begins to plan his next fatally dark move.  However, Drew's sister played by Judy Greer interrupts him with the tragic news of his father's unexpected departure.  Being the responsible person of the family, Drew suspends his suicidal plans and travels from Oregon to the rustic Kentucky town Elizabethtown to take care of the funeral engagements.On the empty night flight across America, Drew encounters the pushy flight attendant Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst).  Instead of allowing Drew to sleep she initiates conversation with him while Drew kindly keeps listening to her.  She even provides a map for him to find his way to Elizabethtown.  So far, the film kept me intrigued and left several lasting notions for continued contemplation, but as the story unfolds more ideas emerge.  An overwhelming flood of constantly new concepts and thoughts enter the silver screen, which relentlessly attempts to tip the viewer over the edge of what one can handle.  Within this chaotic mesh of thoughts, emotions, ideas, and actions the film provides a genuine concept of devastating confusion, as the emotional disoriented Drew seeks to find his lost relation to his father.The film provides concepts such as marriage, death, joy, parenting, music, driving, listening, traveling, love, cremation, and much more.  What is interesting is how Crowe presents each idea, as some of them emerge subtly while force-feeding would give justice to how other notions are illustrated.  Yet, Crowe keeps it genuine, as Drew struggles to find a meaning between him and his dad while also reflecting over his own place in the world, as the refreshing Claire wants to turn his life upside down in a cheerfully bubbly manner.  In some aspects, the film resembles Garden State (2004) while delicately incorporating the philosophical existentialism of both Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004).  However, Crowe does not succeed in elevating the film to the same level of his previous film, or that of others.  Instead, this remarkably clever story succeeds in loosing itself into the clich&eacute;d while appearing like a plate of mish-mashed spaghetti even though it will entertain and give room for thought, and in the end, it will just be like the Jelly Beans' simple construct.",4,"Elizabethtown Warm, Intriguing, Loving, Gloomy, Happy... and More",1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,3654,"['rumors', 'Elizabethtown', 'dreadfulness', 'have', 'reached', 'ears', 'intrigued', 'more', 'bothered', 'fascination', 'stemmed', 'how', 'poorly', 'received', 'film', 'was', 'Toronto', 'Film', 'Festival', '2005', 'only', 'fueled', 'negative', 'buzz', 'film', 'buzz', 'triggered', 'curiosity', 'experience', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'film', 'now', 'been', 'shortened', 'approximately', 'quarter', 'hour', 'Crowe', 'previous', 'films', 'such', 'Almost', 'Famous', '2000', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', '1996', 'also', 'stimulate', 'desire', 'see', 'reports', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'slightly', 'lessened', 'expectations', 'retrospect', 'knowing', 'what', 'Crowe', 'capable', 'must', 'bring', 'forth', 'analogy', 'flavors', 'Jelly', 'Beans', 'Jelly', 'Beans', 'exist', 'large', 'number', 'different', 'flavors', 'occasionally', 'buy', 'wide', 'assortment', 'flavors', 'intake', 'are', 'surprises', 'ranging', 'exotically', 'delicious', 'vulgarly', 'nasty', 'only', 'flavored', 'sugar.The', 'story', 'Elizabethtown', 'centers', 'once', 'successful', 'sport', 'shoe', 'designer', 'Drew', 'Baylor', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'learning', 'lesson', 'supreme', 'failure', 'Drew', 'efforts', 'create', 'ultimate', 'footwear', 'have', 'backfired', 'almost', 'single', 'pair', 'returns', 'manufacturer', 'expensive', 'fiasco', 'will', 'cost', 'company', 'total', '972', 'million', 'dollars', 'tarnish', 'company', 'name', 'anyone', 'lean', 'Drew', 'withdraws', 'plan', 'next', 'fatally', 'dark', 'move', 'However', 'Drew', 'sister', 'played', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'tragic', 'news', 'father', 'unexpected', 'departure', 'Being', 'responsible', 'person', 'family', 'Drew', 'suicidal', 'plans', 'travels', 'Oregon', 'rustic', 'Kentucky', 'town', 'Elizabethtown', 'take', 'care', 'funeral', 'empty', 'night', 'flight', 'America', 'Drew', 'pushy', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Claire', 'Colburn', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Instead', 'allowing', 'Drew', 'sleep', 'conversation', 'Drew', 'kindly', 'listening', 'even', 'map', 'find', 'way', 'Elizabethtown', 'So', 'far', 'film', 'kept', 'intrigued', 'left', 'several', 'lasting', 'notions', 'continued', 'contemplation', 'story', 'more', 'ideas', 'emerge', 'overwhelming', 'flood', 'constantly', 'new', 'concepts', 'thoughts', 'enter', 'silver', 'screen', 'relentlessly', 'tip', 'viewer', 'edge', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'handle', 'chaotic', 'mesh', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'ideas', 'actions', 'film', 'genuine', 'concept', 'devastating', 'confusion', 'emotional', 'disoriented', 'Drew', 'find', 'lost', 'relation', 'father.The', 'film', 'concepts', 'such', 'marriage', 'death', 'joy', 'parenting', 'music', 'driving', 'listening', 'traveling', 'love', 'cremation', 'much', 'more', 'What', 'interesting', 'how', 'Crowe', 'presents', 'idea', 'emerge', 'subtly', 'force-feeding', 'would', 'give', 'justice', 'how', 'other', 'notions', 'are', 'illustrated', 'Crowe', 'genuine', 'Drew', 'find', 'meaning', 'dad', 'also', 'reflecting', 'own', 'place', 'world', 'refreshing', 'Claire', 'turn', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'cheerfully', 'bubbly', 'manner', 'aspects', 'film', 'resembles', 'Garden', 'State', '2004', 'delicately', 'incorporating', 'philosophical', 'existentialism', 'Before', 'Sunrise', '1995', 'Sunset', '2004', 'However', 'Crowe', 'not', 'succeed', 'elevating', 'film', 'same', 'level', 'previous', 'film', 'others', 'Instead', 'remarkably', 'clever', 'story', 'loosing', 'clich', 'eacute', 'appearing', 'plate', 'mish-mashed', 'spaghetti', 'even', 'will', 'entertain', 'give', 'room', 'thought', 'end', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'Jelly', 'Beans', 'simple', 'construct']",N/A

Not particularily bad but not even close to some of the fantastic movies that Cameron Crowe has written/directed in the past.Elizabethtown is a story about a young guy named Drew (Orlano Bloom) whose lost millions for the shoe company he works for. He learns that his father dies and then travels back to his hometown to take care of the funeral arrangements. On his way home he meets Claire (Kirsten Dunst) and romance blossoms.I'm not a big fan of any of the actors in this movie. Jessica Biel...she only had a small part but I can't really get past her 7th Heaven character (even though we can all tell from the movie roles she's taking that she's trying very hard to move on from Mary Camden). Orlando Bloom...let's just say that he's a far cry from John Cusack in ""Say Anything"". And Kirsten Dunst just didn't have that sweet/mysterious girl-next-door appeal that I think they were looking for. She just ended up coming off as annoying...Alec Baldwin and Susan Surandon are also in the film but had smaller parts.Cameron Crowe should really stick to not-so-well-known actors. He picked too many big name actors for this movie and I think that's why this movie wasn't what the audience and fans were expecting. For example, Almost Famous didn't have the big name actors in it and so you could focus more on their character. The casting should have been more well thought out.However, the soundtrack is awesome!

170290,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1415719284,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 11]","I know that Drew Baylor (Orlando) is literally not the last person in Cameron Crowe's ""Elizabethtown"" who knows that he is in love with Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst), but it sure seems that way.  Drew certain last good reason to be distracted from the obvious.  In fact he has two good reasons.  The first is that he has been fired from his job, having designed a shoe that was has been recalled, a business fiasco that is so monumental that according to Phil (Alec Baldwin), who owns the company, an entire generation will go without shoes.  The name of the sneaker was the ""Spasmodica,"" so there is ample evidence that Drew has a blind spot when it comes to the obvious (which includes the fact that his girl friend is dumping him).  The second is that his father has died, and as the responsible one in his family Drew is dispatched back to Elizabethtown to take care of the funeral arrangements.  On the red-eye to Louisville is where Drew, the only passenger on the plane, meets Claire, the flight attendant.Drew's father died on a visit to his hometown where apparently everybody knew him if they were not outright related to him.  His mother (Susan Sarandon) did not go on the visit and is loathe to show up for the funeral because she is blamed by everybody in Elizabethtown for taking the beloved Mitch away to California.  The fact the family lives in Oregon is beside the point.  For Drew there is a more personal tightrope to walk, because everybody thinks he is a big success and the magazine cover story that will expose him to the world is not due out until next week.  It is really only the cell phone calls with Claire that are keeping him sane and when they meet at the end of an all-night conversation it seems that maybe their relationship has already peaked.  But we have seen the trailer, so we know that would be just plain wrong.On the one hand the bad news is that this movie does not really kick into high gear until we get to Mitch's funeral, where Drew's mother gets up and confronts the people who have looked down their collective noses at her all these years.  Crowe then gets to the scene where the cute couple with their names before the title of the movie are supposed to get together, but although it is perfectly obvious to Claire what is supposed to happen, Drew still does not have his head on straight.  Fortunately, Claire does not take what Drew does as a rejection and creates something that will help Drew with that rather significant problem.  All he has to do is follow her instructions:  ""Begin your journey and do not skip ahead"" (I do not want to spoil the discovery on the chance you will think it is as neat as I do).I was wondering if maybe there was a problem in that Bloom is just too good looking to be Crowe's proxy in this film, but the flaw in ""Elizabethtown"" is that the writer-director saves the best for last and then does not have as much time as we would like to see him really develop it.  One of the things that can make a romantic film, whether it be comedy or drama, is a grand gesture and Crowe has come up with some of the best in movie history.  John Cusak with the boom box playing ""In Your Eyes"" in ""Say Anything"" topped the ""Entertainment Weekly"" list of best romantic moments and they can never make fun of ""You had me at hello"" from ""Jerry Maquire"" enough to deflate its poignancy.  In ""Elizabethtown"" Crowe is trying for something big in this regard, but I think it is something that should have been the subject of an entire film and not just the final act.  In fact, I do not want to watch Drew take his journey, I want to go on it.",4,Begin your jounrey and do not skip ahead...,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,3610,"['know', 'Drew', 'Baylor', 'Orlando', 'literally', 'not', 'last', 'person', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Elizabethtown', 'who', 'love', 'Claire', 'Colburn', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'sure', 'way', 'Drew', 'certain', 'last', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'distracted', 'obvious', 'fact', 'two', 'good', 'reasons', 'first', 'been', 'fired', 'job', 'having', 'designed', 'shoe', 'was', 'been', 'recalled', 'business', 'fiasco', 'so', 'monumental', 'according', 'Phil', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'company', 'entire', 'generation', 'will', 'go', 'shoes', 'name', 'sneaker', 'was', 'Spasmodica', 'ample', 'evidence', 'Drew', 'blind', 'spot', 'when', 'obvious', 'fact', 'girl', 'friend', 'dumping', 'second', 'father', 'died', 'responsible', 'one', 'family', 'Drew', 'dispatched', 'back', 'Elizabethtown', 'take', 'care', 'funeral', 'arrangements', 'red-eye', 'Louisville', 'where', 'Drew', 'only', 'passenger', 'plane', 'meets', 'Claire', 'flight', 'attendant.Drew', 'father', 'died', 'visit', 'hometown', 'where', 'apparently', 'everybody', 'knew', 'were', 'not', 'outright', 'related', 'mother', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'visit', 'loathe', 'show', 'up', 'funeral', 'blamed', 'everybody', 'Elizabethtown', 'taking', 'beloved', 'Mitch', 'away', 'California', 'fact', 'family', 'Oregon', 'point', 'Drew', 'more', 'personal', 'tightrope', 'walk', 'everybody', 'big', 'success', 'magazine', 'cover', 'story', 'will', 'expose', 'world', 'not', 'due', 'next', 'week', 'really', 'only', 'cell', 'phone', 'Claire', 'are', 'keeping', 'sane', 'when', 'meet', 'end', 'all-night', 'conversation', 'maybe', 'relationship', 'already', 'peaked', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong.On', 'one', 'hand', 'bad', 'news', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'kick', 'high', 'gear', 'get', 'Mitch', 'funeral', 'where', 'Drew', 'mother', 'up', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'looked', 'down', 'collective', 'noses', 'years', 'Crowe', 'then', 'scene', 'where', 'cute', 'couple', 'names', 'title', 'movie', 'are', 'supposed', 'get', 'together', 'perfectly', 'obvious', 'Claire', 'what', 'supposed', 'happen', 'Drew', 'still', 'not', 'have', 'head', 'straight', 'Fortunately', 'Claire', 'not', 'take', 'what', 'Drew', 'rejection', 'something', 'will', 'help', 'Drew', 'rather', 'significant', 'problem', 'do', 'follow', 'instructions', 'Begin', 'journey', 'do', 'not', 'skip', 'ahead', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'discovery', 'chance', 'will', 'think', 'as', 'neat', 'do', '.I', 'was', 'wondering', 'maybe', 'was', 'problem', 'Bloom', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'be', 'Crowe', 'proxy', 'film', 'flaw', 'Elizabethtown', 'writer-director', 'best', 'last', 'then', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'really', 'develop', 'One', 'things', 'can', 'make', 'romantic', 'film', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', 'grand', 'gesture', 'Crowe', 'come', 'up', 'best', 'movie', 'history', 'John', 'Cusak', 'boom', 'box', 'playing', 'Eyes', 'Say', 'Anything', 'topped', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'list', 'best', 'romantic', 'moments', 'can', 'never', 'make', 'fun', 'had', 'hello', 'Jerry', 'Maquire', 'enough', 'deflate', 'poignancy', 'Elizabethtown', 'Crowe', 'trying', 'something', 'big', 'regard', 'think', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'final', 'act', 'fact', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'Drew', 'take', 'journey', 'want', 'go']",N/A

170292,A23HARLGS8CE8I,1415719284,littlecaspian,"[3, 14]","It's hard for me to measure exactly how bad this film is- is it because I watched it with such high expectations that it fell so far short, or was it really just a big old mess from any perspective?Although I've loved Cameron Crowe's previous films such as ""Say Anything"", ""Almost Famous"" and ""Jerry Maguire"", there has always been a smidgen of grandiloquence in them, a sentimentality and self-importance that was just off-beat or real enough to avoid treacherous groans.  However, with this film I have the impression that Crowe was shooting for the moon and instead of taking us on the journey in Lloyd Dobler's Chevy Malibu with its sticky tape deck or down the highway singing ""Free Fallin'"" with Mr Maguire or crammed in with a band on a rickety tour bus named Doris, he has- like Wile. E Coyote would do- shoveled as much of everything that made those other films great into a big old cannon, jammed himself in with the declaration that this film is closest to his heart, and pointed it to the sky.It was never much of a surprise in those old Warner cartoons when the coyote's plan backfired so I guess I shouldn't have been so disappointed that my hopes for ""Elizabethtown"" blew up in my face.  But what set those expectations of mine so high and made the viewing of the film so frustrating was that all the elements of a great film were there, from concept to actors to the essential Crowe feature of soundtrack.  It was simply executed very poorly.  And, in some instances, actual execution would have been downright commendable.The general idea driving the plot- a young succesful man becomes disillusioned after experiencing huge failure but meets a young woman who helps him recover and reignites his spirit and passion- is solid enough.  It proved its mettle in ""Jerry Maguire""- this film just kicks the idea up to the max.  Rather than just being fired and walking out of the office carrying a baggie of goldfish, Drew Baylor in ""Elizabethtown"" barrels straight down suicide alley, rigging out an exercise machine to complete the job (a scene which sets the ludicrous bar pretty high, yet later scenes still manage to bump their heads).  The woman of redemption, played here by Kirsten Dunst, has no valid connection to the leading man through work or anything else so her penchant for popping up here there and everywhere in Drew's life presents a far more worrisome bundle of stalker and co-dependency issues than Renee Zellweger's single mom sweetness.  And instead of Cuba Gooding's difficult but ebulliant football player shouting ""Show me the money!"", we have Susan Sarandon as Drew's mother performing the most wretched memorial to her dead husband that practically demands the viewer bathe their eyeballs in lye afterwards.Note: I am not against comedy-and-dance routines at memorials per se- a good Thriller interpretation or Eddie Murphy ""Delirious"" rendition goes a long way on a solemn occasion- but I swear, if anyone does a routine like Sarandon's at my memorial, they'll be scouting the Yellow Pages for a good exorcism priest.The plot problems escalate from there, with far too many characters and nowhere scenes and jumps and cuts and hacks being piled onto the already flimsy structure, until it all just throws itself into the middle of the highway and lets the 20min road trip finale mow it down to the aspartame ending.  It is a hodgepodge of genres and themes and half-baked ideas and I suppose being that its protagonist is a twentysomething, this confused sense of self is at least a reflection of that age in life.  However, if this movie was indeed a twentysomething person, it's not the guy whooping it up with his friends and carrying on like an entertaining loon, it's not even the guy sitting around a table with a caffeine IV drip discussing the political import of old TV shows; it's the one slumped down the end of the bar sulking into a fancy beer and trying to impress the nice bar wench with pilfered philosophies.All that said, I still harbor some speck of belief- or perhaps curiosity- that had the film been made with different lead actors, it might not have drowned in this well-meaning morass.  It may simply have been the way the parts were written, but Orlando Bloom had nowhere near enough charisma to pull the character of Drew Baylor out of the self-pitying dumps and into the audience's affections, and Kirsten Dunst relied so much on a smug quirk of a smile that it began to seem more like a physical tic than an expression of Penny Lane-type mystique.  Neither character was imbued by the actors with a real sense of life or depth, which made it all the more frustrating because some of the dialogue and scenes were worthy of much more.  Ultimately, Dunst and Bloom were merely window-dressing and the store was empty, burgled by the memory of better characters and the possibility of better actors.What made the two-hours-plus film bearable was the music.  Crowe has a terrific track record (ha! pun not intended) with compiling soundtracks for his films and while this may be the strongest selection of music- the album is terrific- its use in the actual film does not nearly reach the effectiveness of Springsteen's ""Secret Garden"" in 'Jerry Maguire' or Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" in 'Almost Famous'.  This is somewhat ironic, given that music is specifically built into this film thanks to the road trip instructions Dunst's character gives to Drew, but as on the car journey it does the same throughout the film itself, merely providing background noise and appropriate songs but no focal points, no hook from which to hang the movie in the viewer's mind.Which leads me to the only piece of advice I gleaned from this movie so riddled with hints- buy the soundtrack, and make up your own movie in your head as you lay back and listen to it.  Make it a romance, a comedy, a drama, an action flick or a weepy- it'll be better than this, I betcha.",1,When Good Ideas Go Bad and Tear Up the Furniture While You're Out,1142467200,"03 16,

If you read a summary of the movie before you watch it. You think, ""oh that sounds good"". But when you watch it, you will be disappointed.My major complaint:The characters were flat and undevelopedKirsten Dunst would try to be deep and say cute quotes and smile with her cute dimple, hoping that the audience will forget the terrible script she was given. Orlando Bloom didn't seem that sad about his dad dying,his grieving process was quite confusingThings that were not believable in this movie1) How did Kirsten Dunst (Claire) have the time to make Orlando Bloom (Drew) the huge scrapbook of his guide to his lonely road trip?They only knew each other for a couple of days, so logically, it would have been mostly impossible.2) Drew and Claire were trying to be deep on the phone, but in person, they had less personalityThings that were pointless in this movie1) The whole wedding at the hotel. All of the characters. It was soo pointless.2) The little boy who decided to drive Orlando Blooms car and the little boy's stupid naive father who refused to discipline his child3) Susan Sarandon dancing during her speech at the her husbands funeral. This part was so bogus and ridiculous4) The band that played at the funeral who lit a paper bird on fire and destroyed the whole banquet?I could name all parts of this movie in this list because most of it was pointless.

I highly enjoyed ""Almost Famous"" and ""Vanilla Sky"" and, to a good degree, also ""Jerry Maguire"". So I wasn't ready for Elizabethtown.Good things:-The music. Cameron Crowe, being the music journalist he's always been at heart, could not give us a lame soundtrack, and this movie was no exception. The CD with the OST will be so short for so much good music, timed perfectly to every single scene...-The overall idea. There was so much potential in the whole concept, and I admit I was ready to shed a tear a few times, having lived through a couple of experiences that could be comparable to the ones in the movie, to a certain extent... plus I loved the whole timing of the road trip to the music. Can't have a good road trip without good music!OK things:-The acting. Mostly Orlando Bloom pulled off a decent performance. I didn't feel the same way about Kirsten Dunst. :(Terrible things:-The unfinished themes. Notice that, under the heading for ""the overall idea"" above, I underlined the word ""ready"". I mean that because I was READY, but never actually did... the movie wanted to touch on so many things, all of which could have earned it a quite a good result, but none of which it definitely got to, in my opinion. It tried to be too many things, and started too many themes it couldn't quite finish.-Too long, ineffective editing. Ironic that in spite of the movie being as long as it was (or as it felt, at least), it couldn't cover well most of the themes it set out to deal with. In my head, that spells out ""ineffective editing"".Overall, it doesn't deserve more than three stars. Maybe a good rental, but not worth spending your money on it, by going to the theater.",3,"OK, for the most part... Ah!

Susan Sarandon and Cameron Crowe joined Rodger Ebert for the opening night festivities.  Although Sarandon drew a major crowd for the festival's opening night and will, I'm sure, do the same for the movie's general release, her role as Drew's mother was the least remarkable role she's played to date.Elizabethtown is the romantic comedy about the death of a career and father and the birth of a romance.  Drew Baylor, portrayed by Orlando Bloom, is devastated at the failure of his new product release (space gym shoes) that ends up costing his company millions of dollars.  Added to this disappointment is the news of his father's death which in many ways ends up saving Drew's life.  When Drew is asked to return to Elizabethtown to finalize arrangements for his father's funeral, he is befriended by Claire, a flight attendant portrayed by Kirsten Dunst.  Claire helps Drew realize that failure is an event, never a person and that life after the death of a loved one can still hold great promise for the survivors.  The film is formulaic in some instances; however, the soundtrack and comedy throughout made this an enjoyable viewing.  It's a great date flick.

170300,ATNX84AGYIN39,1415719284,"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard""","[7, 10]","I wouldn't be writing this if it weren't for the American icon, Cameron Crowe. He's responsible, and I say that in the most positive way, for the rock epic Almost Famous, the most precise and realistic romance picture Singles, and the '80s iconography featured in both Say Anything and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. More recently, and four years after his last movie, he's responsible for Elizabethtown.Elizabethtown just may be the first film I've seen where I didn't feel like I was watching an actual film. The entire movie is unconventional, non formulaic and utterly beautiful. Crowe goes home to the heartland of Kentucky and literally drags the audience along on a road trip. A road trip in which, if your hand touches the dial on that radio, you're likely bound for a light slap.Here's the deal: Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) is informed of the disaster that is his shoe design. A small recall that just so happens to result in a ""you can call it,"" billion-dollar catastrophe falls into his lap. To put it lightly, Drew is fired and winds up at home with a suicide plan on the table, his only true escape. Then, he receives a call from his family informing him of his father's death. Depressed, downtrodden Drew takes the burden of having to travel to his father's hometown of Elizabethtown, Ky. to make arrangements for his father's corpse. On the way, he meets Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst), a flight attendant, who makes his trip - somewhat interesting.To answer everyone, no, this is nothing like Garden State. To anyone that disagrees, well, go see the film. As for those who have seen the film and still disagree, well, to each is own. Elizabethtown has a thick storyline that weaves in and out, something critics are already panning. Unfortunately, this is true. Fortunately, this is also false. Crowe's screenplay takes Drew and the audience to the lifestyles of small town living and, by the end of the film, on the road across America. Elizabethtown has romance, comedy and the American dream all rolled up in one.Imagine the happy parts of On the Road with a killer soundtrack.Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst work well together. Bloom triumphs - his looks, his emotions and his interactions flow brilliantly. On the other hand, Dunst breaks with the more stoic parts in recent years and takes on the role of a country sweetheart with pride. When she smiles, the entire cast does. Also on board, Susan Sarandon and old-timer Bruce McGill roll in some memorable moments too.No Cameron Crowe film works without a genius soundtrack. My Morning Jacket, Elton John, Tom Petty and The Hollies all fill in the necessary voids for emotional escapism. But the real hero to the sound is Nancy Wilson (of Heart), Cameron Crowe's wife. Her score to the film tightens some really great scenes, and I might even buy that over the initial soundtrack.There is something about this film. Whether it is the randomness of some scenes, the moments I might have related to, or the portrayal of America, there is something ultimately universal about it. Maybe it's like the family dinner on Sunday when you were ten or twelve. Maybe it's the way we look at sunsets. Or perhaps Cameron Crowe just made another really great movie. One thing's certain: Elizabethtown met my expectations and surprised me on many levels.I recommend advise.",5,Cameron Crowe dusts off some photo albums,1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,3330,"['would', ""n't"", 'be', 'writing', 'were', ""n't"", 'American', 'icon', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'responsible', 'say', 'most', 'positive', 'way', 'rock', 'epic', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'most', 'precise', 'realistic', 'romance', 'picture', 'Singles', ""'80s"", 'iconography', 'featured', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'More', 'recently', 'four', 'years', 'last', 'movie', 'responsible', 'Elizabethtown.Elizabethtown', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'actual', 'film', 'entire', 'movie', 'unconventional', 'non', 'formulaic', 'utterly', 'beautiful', 'Crowe', 'home', 'heartland', 'Kentucky', 'literally', 'audience', 'along', 'road', 'trip', 'road', 'trip', 'hand', 'dial', 'radio', ""'re"", 'likely', 'bound', 'light', 'deal', 'Drew', 'Baylor', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'informed', 'disaster', 'shoe', 'design', 'small', 'recall', 'just', 'so', 'result', 'can', 'call', 'billion-dollar', 'catastrophe', 'lap', 'put', 'lightly', 'Drew', 'fired', 'up', 'home', 'suicide', 'plan', 'table', 'only', 'true', 'escape', 'Then', 'call', 'family', 'informing', 'father', 'death', 'Depressed', 'downtrodden', 'Drew', 'burden', 'having', 'travel', 'father', 'hometown', 'Elizabethtown', 'Ky.', 'make', 'arrangements', 'father', 'corpse', 'way', 'Claire', 'Colburn', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'flight', 'attendant', 'who', 'trip', 'somewhat', 'interesting.To', 'answer', 'everyone', 'nothing', 'Garden', 'State', 'anyone', 'well', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'still', 'disagree', 'well', 'own', 'Elizabethtown', 'thick', 'storyline', 'something', 'critics', 'are', 'already', 'panning', 'Unfortunately', 'true', 'Fortunately', 'also', 'false', 'Crowe', 'screenplay', 'Drew', 'audience', 'lifestyles', 'small', 'town', 'living', 'end', 'film', 'road', 'America', 'Elizabethtown', 'romance', 'comedy', 'American', 'dream', 'rolled', 'up', 'one.Imagine', 'happy', 'parts', 'Road', 'killer', 'soundtrack.Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'Bloom', 'triumphs', 'looks', 'emotions', 'interactions', 'flow', 'brilliantly', 'other', 'hand', 'Dunst', 'more', 'stoic', 'parts', 'recent', 'years', 'role', 'country', 'sweetheart', 'pride', 'When', 'entire', 'cast', 'Also', 'board', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'old-timer', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'roll', 'memorable', 'moments', 'too.No', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'film', 'genius', 'soundtrack', 'Morning', 'Jacket', 'Elton', 'John', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Hollies', 'fill', 'necessary', 'voids', 'emotional', 'escapism', 'real', 'hero', 'sound', 'Nancy', 'Wilson', 'Heart', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'wife', 'score', 'film', 'really', 'great', 'scenes', 'might', 'even', 'buy', 'initial', 'soundtrack.There', 'something', 'film', 'randomness', 'scenes', 'moments', 'might', 'have', 'related', 'portrayal', 'America', 'something', 'ultimately', 'universal', 'Maybe', 'family', 'dinner', 'Sunday', 'when', 'were', 'ten', 'twelve', 'Maybe', 'way', 'look', 'sunsets', 'perhaps', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'just', 'made', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'Elizabethtown', 'met', 'expectations', 'surprised', 'many', 'levels.I', 'recommend', 'advise']",N/A

If you are anyone else, well, I'd suggest something else.The movie begins with Bloom, a low-level, ""I only have a cubicle"" shoe designer being told that he personally lost the company $970 million dollars with his new shoe design.  Oh, please.  Just as he's about to kill himself (in a slightly amusing manner), the phone rings.

Or, things mentioned wouldn't be relevant.  He's not to bring back his father. He's supposed to cremate him!  What about that big job loss? How about that shady deal by Billy which bilked his father out of money?The other things that made the movie so deplorable were the lame lines and scenes.  Oh, there are so many to pick from. How about Bloom looking at his father's body and saying, ""He looks whimsical.""  Or, perhaps the widow telling off-color stories on stage in front of all 300 people at the memorial service and then tap dancing to Moon River (and the whole audience thinking this is a great idea?).  Or, perhaps it is the hellion child Samson who is instantly cured of his horribleness by watching a two-minute video, ""Rusty's Guide to Communication--Part 8"" where he must promise to obey his parents before Rusty will blow up a house.  Oooh. But, I think I liked best the large paper mache bird which was let loose on a wire over the memorial service while the cousin's band played Free Bird. Of course, this bird sets the hotel room on fire and gives Bloom and Dunst the opportunity to stare at each other meaningfully from across the room while they are drenched by the sprinklers.Lest you think this movie is a comedy, it is NOT!

But at best I found it marginal and was sorry to see two of my favorite actors almost wasted in this movie.Orlando Bloom plays a young man who has spent 8 years designing a sneaker to rival the best of them.  But the sneakers are quickly recalled for a flaw and the company loses close to a billion dollars on this disaster.  As if that isn't enough word reaches Bloom that his father has just died while visiting his brother in Kentucky. Bloom is elected by his mother, played by the incomparable Susan Sarandon, to travel from Oregon where he and his family lives to Kentucky to bring his father's body home for burial.  But the Kentucky family, who has never seen eye to eye with Sarandon's character, has other plans for their family member and it is up to Bloom to sort this out.  While on the plane he meets a lively if somewhat daffy and spiritual stewardess who encourages him to let loose and make a road trip on his way back to his family. The movie was filled with some rather quirky characters which should have made it more interesting but didn't.  Even the direction of Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous) and a great soundtrack failed to interest me and I had trouble watching this till the end.Despite my negative thoughts, at this point I must add that there was one very special moment in this film.  The scene where Susan Sarandon dances a soft shoe to the music of Moon River as a tribute to her late husband was priceless.All and all, I felt as though the movie was lacking something although I'm sot sure what that was.

The shoe ends up being an epic failure which is looking to cost the company almost 1 billion dollars. Drew is fired, looses his company girlfriend and decides to kill himself. As he is about to end his own life the phone rings. His hysterical sister informs Drew that his father has just died while on a trip to his home town in Kentucky, Elizabethtown, and that Drew must go their immediately to handle the family business. Drew decides to put his suicide on hold temporarily to handle the family business for his mother and sister and I guess what is intended to be a touching emotional story ensues......Cameron Crowe is responsible for some phenomenal movies including, ""Jerry Maguire"", ""Almost Famous"", ""Vanilla Sky"", and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Widescreen Special Edition)"" amongst others. ""Elizabethtown"" however makes me wonder if we haven't already seen Cameron's Peak. It was just a mess of a movie. It felt like he had ideas for 3 separate movies, couldn't focus on any of them for very long and then decided to take what he had on each and combine them into one movie. You are given the ""Family death/crisis"" movie since Drew's father died. You are given ""Finding love in an unexpected place while on the rebound"" movie as Drew meets Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst) while on his way to Kentucky, And Finally we have the ""Redemption/Road trip"" movie as Drew decides to drive home from Kentucky to Oregon. If you combine all of the other touched on themes and sub-plots that were never developed you may actually have about 5 partial movies in this thing. I was constantly left with the feeling that I had missed something as the sound track was insisting that a touching or powerful moment was unfolding on screen and I kept on wondering where the development for this powerful moment took place.The Good: The actor's performances seemed solid overall. The sound track had its strong points.The Bad: There was no cohesive plot or story to be found. Just a very meandering thing that never seemed to really get focused on what story it was trying to tell and this ruined anything positive that might have happened. I was left wondering what it was all about and what I had missed. The scene where Susan Sarandon tap dances at her husband's funeral and discusses her neighbor's equipment was also very disturbing to me for some reason. I think I would roll over in my grave if my wife turned my funeral into a self serving charade such as the one on display in Elizabethtown.Overall: Skip this one.

170317,A1D3XQC2DIT,1415719284,Peter Shermeta,"[2, 6]","Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) has just had a very difficult day at work. He received the hard-to-swallow news that a product he designed, though it made him a hero in the office prior to its announcement to the public, was a disaster and would cost the company an incredible sum of money. He was politely asked to shoulder the blame for the product's fate...while he was being fired. Later that night, he was swimming in a pool of self-pity when his sister called to deliver more bad news. Their father, Mitch, had died of a heart attack.When he died, Mitch was visiting his family in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, a city and a lineage that his wife and two children all but ignored. The town was small and the pace of life was slow. The people were friendly and everyone knew and loved Mitch Baylor. Drew, labeled the ""responsible"" one, was nominated to represent his mom (Susan Sarandon) and sister (Judy Greer) at the memorial in Elizabethtown.Drew had to embark on a journey to a place as foreign to him as the people who lived there. Each person he met seemed to know him well, though he did not truly know any of them. That began what became a very humbling trip for Drew. The sharp contrast between big-city life and small-town life made itself evident. Drew was accustomed to his corporate surroundings, back home, where people smiled, but you never knew what to make of it. In Elizabethtown he knew they were happy and friendly people. They cared about him and his father.On his flight to Kentucky, Drew met a flight attendant named Claire (Kirsten Dunst). She was extremely friendly, maybe even too friendly. Through a strange turn of events (and no one else to call), Drew and Claire connect on the phone. Claire becomes Drew's crutch in his time of need. She is the catalyst that opens his eyes to who he is, who his father was, and how important family should be.I think Drew Baylor had expectations for the people in Kentucky. I think he expected that they all were stereotypical back-country folks who could not relate to him, nor understand the world he lived in. That was essentially why his mother and sister elected him to go in their place. They all felt that way. Claire disproved this expectation. They connected on more levels than Drew could have ever imagined. His guard dropped and he was able to appreciate the countless anecdotes and southern hospitality he received from his dad's side of the family.He, eventually, was very touched by the warm reception he received and more so by how loved his dad was in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. Drew did not know his father very well. Over the past few years life at work took on an exclusive role on Drew's time and attention, which led to a change in the father-son relationship that had been strong when Drew was a boy. He was reacquainted with his dad through family and friends in Elizabethtown. It was truly a chance for Drew to get to know his father all over again, something he should not have saved until his father had died. But Mitch Baylor was not the only one Drew got to know all over again on this trip. He also became reacquainted with himself...with a little help.The movie was not without flaws, some of which make events unrealistic, but I quickly got over them. They were trivial things that should not concern me nor should they detract from my feelings toward this movie, which were fiercely positive.Orlando Bloom, for the first time, stepped outside the Legolas mold into which I had him so snuggly typecast. I thought he did well as Drew Baylor.Kirsten Dunst is another who is not normally one of my favorites, but she did well. Normally her characters are so elitest and conceited, but as Claire Coburn she was much more down to Earth. It was a nice change.A lot of people have compared this movie to Garden State, which is not without merit. The journey (in a general sense) on which each protagonist ventures is one through a clouded sense of reality to a broader perspective that among other things emphasizes the importance of family and is lead by a new-found, outgoing female friend from a chance meeting.Elizabethtown has a broader appeal than Garden State. The latter is more targeted to a younger audience through subject matter concerning drugs, prescription and otherwise. Elizabethtown is more about getting to know the people around you and learning the faces of those who matter most. (Though both movies feature very good soundtracks.)I have already recommended Elizabethtown to my parents and they both said they liked it a lot. I have not recommended they see Garden State.",5,Touching story about the importance of family.,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,4576,"['Drew', 'Baylor', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'just', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'day', 'work', 'received', 'hard-to-swallow', 'news', 'product', 'designed', 'made', 'hero', 'office', 'prior', 'announcement', 'public', 'was', 'disaster', 'would', 'cost', 'company', 'incredible', 'sum', 'money', 'was', 'politely', 'asked', 'shoulder', 'blame', 'product', 'fate', 'was', 'being', 'fired', 'Later', 'night', 'was', 'swimming', 'pool', 'self-pity', 'when', 'sister', 'called', 'deliver', 'more', 'bad', 'news', 'father', 'Mitch', 'had', 'died', 'heart', 'attack.When', 'died', 'Mitch', 'was', 'visiting', 'family', 'Elizabethtown', 'Kentucky', 'city', 'lineage', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'ignored', 'town', 'was', 'small', 'pace', 'life', 'was', 'slow', 'people', 'were', 'friendly', 'everyone', 'knew', 'loved', 'Mitch', 'Baylor', 'Drew', 'labeled', 'responsible', 'one', 'was', 'nominated', 'represent', 'mom', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'sister', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'memorial', 'Elizabethtown.Drew', 'had', 'embark', 'journey', 'place', 'foreign', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'there', 'person', 'met', 'seemed', 'know', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'truly', 'know', 'began', 'what', 'became', 'very', 'humbling', 'trip', 'Drew', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'big-city', 'life', 'small-town', 'life', 'made', 'evident', 'Drew', 'was', 'accustomed', 'corporate', 'surroundings', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'people', 'smiled', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'make', 'Elizabethtown', 'knew', 'were', 'happy', 'friendly', 'people', 'cared', 'father.On', 'flight', 'Kentucky', 'Drew', 'met', 'flight', 'attendant', 'named', 'Claire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'was', 'extremely', 'friendly', 'maybe', 'even', 'too', 'friendly', 'strange', 'turn', 'events', 'one', 'else', 'call', 'Drew', 'Claire', 'connect', 'phone', 'Claire', 'Drew', 'crutch', 'time', 'need', 'catalyst', 'eyes', 'who', 'who', 'father', 'was', 'how', 'important', 'family', 'should', 'be.I', 'think', 'Drew', 'Baylor', 'had', 'expectations', 'people', 'Kentucky', 'think', 'expected', 'were', 'stereotypical', 'back-country', 'folks', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'relate', 'understand', 'world', 'lived', 'was', 'essentially', 'why', 'mother', 'sister', 'elected', 'go', 'place', 'felt', 'way', 'Claire', 'disproved', 'expectation', 'connected', 'more', 'levels', 'Drew', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'imagined', 'guard', 'dropped', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'countless', 'anecdotes', 'southern', 'hospitality', 'received', 'dad', 'side', 'family.He', 'eventually', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'warm', 'reception', 'received', 'more', 'so', 'how', 'loved', 'dad', 'was', 'Elizabethtown', 'Kentucky', 'Drew', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'father', 'very', 'well', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'life', 'work', 'took', 'exclusive', 'role', 'Drew', 'time', 'attention', 'led', 'change', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'had', 'been', 'strong', 'when', 'Drew', 'was', 'boy', 'was', 'reacquainted', 'dad', 'family', 'friends', 'Elizabethtown', 'was', 'truly', 'chance', 'Drew', 'get', 'know', 'father', 'over', 'again', 'something', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'saved', 'father', 'had', 'died', 'Mitch', 'Baylor', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'Drew', 'got', 'know', 'over', 'again', 'trip', 'also', 'became', 'reacquainted', 'little', 'help.The', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'flaws', 'make', 'events', 'unrealistic', 'quickly', 'got', 'were', 'trivial', 'things', 'should', 'not', 'concern', 'should', 'detract', 'feelings', 'movie', 'were', 'fiercely', 'positive.Orlando', 'Bloom', 'first', 'time', 'stepped', 'Legolas', 'mold', 'had', 'so', 'snuggly', 'typecast', 'thought', 'did', 'well', 'Drew', 'Baylor.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'not', 'normally', 'one', 'favorites', 'did', 'well', 'Normally', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'elitest', 'conceited', 'Claire', 'Coburn', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'down', 'Earth', 'was', 'nice', 'change.A', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'compared', 'movie', 'Garden', 'State', 'not', 'merit', 'journey', 'general', 'sense', 'protagonist', 'ventures', 'one', 'clouded', 'sense', 'reality', 'broader', 'perspective', 'other', 'things', 'importance', 'family', 'lead', 'new-found', 'outgoing', 'female', 'friend', 'chance', 'meeting.Elizabethtown', 'broader', 'appeal', 'Garden', 'State', 'latter', 'more', 'targeted', 'younger', 'audience', 'subject', 'matter', 'concerning', 'drugs', 'prescription', 'otherwise', 'Elizabethtown', 'more', 'getting', 'know', 'people', 'learning', 'who', 'matter', 'most', 'movies', 'feature', 'very', 'good', 'soundtracks', 'have', 'already', 'recommended', 'Elizabethtown', 'parents', 'said', 'liked', 'lot', 'have', 'not', 'recommended', 'see', 'Garden', 'State']",N/A
170318,A2EJP1CB7YGPNK,1415719284,Philip B. Yochim,"[2, 3]","""Elizabthtown"" is a lightweight, but fun romantic comedy, a type of good first date movie. Despite the light and breezy feel of the movie, it conveys a deeper message to the end of the movie: the love of your family, and the love of America.Orlando Bloom plays Drew Baylor, a young, supposedly promising shoe designer, whose first project bombs. The idea that a shoe design could cause a multinational company to lose nearly a billion dollars is so stupid it's amazing nobody questions it during the movie. Anyone at that company ever hear of oversight?Anyway, Drew's about to kill himself when he gets word his dad's died, and he needs to go to Kentucky to retrieve the body. Hopping on a red-eye flight, he meets Claire, played by the always adorable Kirstin Dunst. If she hadn't gotten into acting, she probably would be a flight attendant. The annoyingly perky Claire attempts to cheer up the morose Drew, and even gives him a map.It was at this point I got a little annoyed. Cameron Crowe slandered Louisville's roads as difficult to navigate. Like heck! Apparently he's not travelled in Nashville, Cincinnati, or Charleston, S.C. that much. Louisville's roads are easy! How Drew managed to get lost leaving the airport is beyond me. All you need to do is get on I-65 and go south.Anyway, Drew and Claire's cute relationship develops via overnight phone calls and continous contact, including a trip to Cave Hill Cemetery, where my great-grandfather worked as a gravedigger and about half my family is buried.Drew develops from the brooding failure into a man once again ready to take on life, albeit one much different than what he thought it was to be.

I'm a fan of Almost Famous, and Cameron Crowe sends this tale of man-child striving and family oddity spinning into cosmic dust.  The same minor reservations I had about Almost Famous permeate increasingly in Elizabethtown.  There's some contrived laughers and forced concepts offset by slick Hollywood filmmaking.  Another words, the plastic art attempts to overcome the implausibility of script.Case in point, the joyful, all knowing Kirsten Dunst character falls in love with our young failure, Orlando Bloom without explanation.  Her cuteness and peculiarities must offset this lack of congruity.  Kirsten has a wonderful way with this romantic part.  It's not a stretch past her adolescent leads, but she carries the love interest without having to be knock-out gorgeous like Jessica Biel.  I do think her Kentucky accent was a bit much, but since we know Kirsten from her previous flicks, it may not be her fault.Does Susan Sarandon play any other part but the ditzy, new age, mom trying to find herself in this crazy America?  She acts as if George Bush is hunting her with a nuclear missile.  Stop the charade Susan.Elizabethtown is better than most romantic comedies forced on us by The Wedding Crasher crowd of Hollywood, but I'm begging Cameron Crowe, the next time, make your films without Hollywood faces.

Without that connection I can't imagine the appeal.  With it, pure magic happens.  I love the magic.I watch the movie when I'm in a quiet, introspective mood.  It is such a great reminder to remember what is beautiful and important in your life, especially if you work in a fast-paced, pressurized corporate structure.  The jarring contrast between Drew Baylor's inauthentic corporate character (Orlando Bloom) and Claire's peaceful and resolved character (Kirsten Dunst) works beautifully as a foundation for change.  Frame the interaction in a Kentucky town filled with familiar family history, genuine neighborly love, and simple concerns you know something has to give. Quietly assaulted by the glaring differences in the two worlds Drew starts to change.  The resolution, especially the ending sequence, is a true joy to watch as Claire's quiet magic transforms him into who he truly can be, who she saw inside him from the very beginning.

Instead we got an outstanding cast trapped in a disconnected series of montages.Nothing happens in Elizabethtown.  I don't know if this is true of the actual place, but it is certainly true of the movie.  Every phase of this movie is drawn out and is excessively long.Despite being too long, the movie doesn't resolve all the points it raises.  There is a sub plot of Susan Sarandon hating one of her husband's buddies.  This is not resolved.  There is a bratty child named Sampson and his man-child father who can't discipline him.  This is not resolved.  There is the fact that the town is about to learn that Orlando Bloom's character had an enormous business failure.  We never learn their reaction.The whole basis of Bloom's character is idiotic.  Apparently some shoe magnate blew $1 billion creating and marketing a sneaker designed by Orlando Bloom.  Why the designer would be blamed for such a failure is unclear -- Mr. Shoe Billionaire (Phil) should have done some market testing.  Normally I'll give screenwriters a pass on how they get their character to the starting point of the story, but that scene too is so drawn out that it simply became annoying.Finally, the screenplay is terrible.  Bloom's character has no real character arc.  He is kind of depressed about losing his job and having his father die, and then he gets over it.  So what?  There is no blinding insight as to what he has to change.  There is no moment of truth where he must decide on a new outlook in life vs. his old one.The movie doesn't even have the traditional, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl structure.  It's kind of boy-gets-girl, girl-gives-boy-a-cool-handmade-travelogue, boy-sees-girl-again-and-they-kiss.The only reason this movie has 2 stars is that I've seen Hercules with Lou Ferrigno.

Though there are some excellent performances (Orlando Bloom, in particular) and some moments of delightful on-screen chemistry (the phone scene between Bloom & Dunst), most of the greatness within this movie is buried too far underneath the unnecessary quirk and familial mystery that he was able to navigate perfectly in ""Almost Famous"".As always, the music selections are excellent, but some of the characters are completely incomprehensible and grating.  Hollie Baylor (played by an badly utilized Susan Sarandon) indulges in some implausible and ridiculously contrived post-widow behavior which is explained away by an even more ludicrous (and franky, cringeworthy) funeral eulogy.

170326,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,1415719284,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[6, 9]","Cameron Crowe has a talent. Well, he really has many talents -- putting together a good story with great music, pulling unexpected performances out of actors we thought we knew well, telling charmingly witty tales about people we already know, just to name a few. All of these talents are evident in 'Elizabethtown,' but the one that stands out most here is his talent for showing normal people in normal situations, and still making us feel good, even exuberant about it by the end.This is a movie that begins with tragedy. Not just one tragedy, but two: the loss of an astounding amount of money, and the death of a parent. Faced with both losses, Drew (well played by Orlando Bloom) interrupts his plan to end his own life and steps up to do the responsible thing and take care of his family business. Because this is what we do -- faced with tragedy, we often rely on responsibility to get us through it. On the way, he meets Claire (Kirsten Dunst), who throws him off his plan a little, and just keeps appearing as he most needs her.  What starts out as a movie about tragedy becomes a story about life itself, and about all the odd characters we meet in it.When Drew meets his family, the oddball cousins and estranged in-laws and obnoxious nephews, he meets a slice of his past that he hasn't experienced in a long time.  And somewhere along the way, we get a slice of Americana too, one not too often seen on the big screen -- a mixture of joy and pain, serious and ridiculous, unbelievable but undeniably real. The style of the film doesn't look down on anyone, nor does it put them on a pedestal, it simply and straightforwardly presents them as they are.'Elizabethtown' is not a perfect movie by any means, but in its imperfections lie what make it so perfect. In more ways than one, it represents a journey through the heart and soul of America, through what makes it real -- the people that live there. Sweet, charming, funny, honest, and as real as any movie I've seen recently...I found myself watching it and thinking of family I haven't seen in years, and smiling about the friends I have made along the way.Is 'Elizabethtown' a funny fantasy with a grounding in reality, or is it a family comedy with a sprinkling of romantic fantasy?

Zwick,"[8, 10]","Drew Baylor is a young man weighed down by an unusually burdensome burden:  he's managed to single-handedly bankrupt the corporation he works for to the tune of a cool $972,000,000 when the shoe he`s designed fails to catch on with the American public.  With little left to live for and faced with a public humiliation the likes of which few of us could ever possibly imagine let alone survive, the only reasonable thing Drew can think to do is to put a quick end to his suddenly bleak and disastrous life. However, fate intervenes when, in mid-suicide attempt, his phone rings with news that his father has just died while visiting his side of the family in Elizabethtown, Kentucky.  Drew is forced to put off his offing, if only temporarily, while he does his duty taking care of the business of burying his father.  On the way there, he strikes up an acquaintance with a kooky, free-spirited stewardess with whom he begins to develop a relationship.  Meanwhile, he is embraced by the relatives whom he hasn't seen in years and comes to realize just what a special man his father was to the people in Elizabethtown.""Elizabethtown"" was not a roaring critical or commercial success for writer/director Cameron Crowe, but it is a charming, heartwarming film that looks and feels a lot like ""Garden State,"" although, in this case, the young man is returning not to his own hometown but to the hometown of his dad.  Crowe knows how to make romantic comedy look lightweight and easy.  The characters and situations, though grounded in reality, always have a certain off-kilter quality of cockeyed optimism that keeps the movies from wallowing in cliches and that purges them of sentimentality.  Drew's Kentucky relatives are not portrayed as hicks and rubes but rather as kind-hearted people who, though slightly suspicious of that branch of the family ""from California"" (actually they're from Oregon), welcome Drew into their midst with genuine affection and hospitality.The romance between Drew and Claire, the flighty flight attendant, is developed with a great deal of emotion and charm.  It is Claire's job as the life-affirming force in the scenario to articulate for Drew (and for us) what is and what is not important in life, and to see that creating a ""fiasco"" in the business world just doesn't rate as all that important when stacked up against truly important things like love, family and personal relationships.  But, as always with Crowe, the message is never hammered home but filters through subtly, as he creates a thoughtful, lyrical poem through character and setting.The movie hits a few wrong notes along the way, mainly in the scene at his father's memorial service, in which Drew's mom delivers a highly unlikely eulogy and receives an equally unlikely response from the audience.  And the scene itself ends in a bit of desperate slapstick that is not up to the quality of the rest of the material.  And even though Susan Sarandon is always delightful to watch, her character is fairly underdeveloped in this film and so she sometimes feels as if she is more of a tacked-on device than a genuine person in her own right.  But all that is made up for by the wonderful performances of Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst in the lead roles - Bloom underplays beautifully, while Dunst emotes like crazy - and by Alec Baldwin in a wickedly witty cameo as Drew's boss, whose ability to reduce Drew to the mere shadow of a man while dripping with sarcasm and smiling through his clenched teeth is a priceless bit of satire aimed at the dehumanization that lies at the heart of the corporate world mentality.Some viewers might feel cheated by the fact that Crowe reveals little about what kind of a relationship Drew had with his dad growing up.  Drew is clearly not a bitter son, carrying deep-seated resentments around with him through adulthood, but neither does he seem overly affectionate towards the memory of his father or overwhelmed with grief at his passing.  In many ways, Crowe holds back on revealing all this, as if to imply that revealing information of such an intimate nature to the audience would be something of a violation of that sacred bond that exists between a father and his son.  Some artists would undoubtedly choose to go that route - letting the audience in on every sordid detail of the relationship - but Crowe is clearly an artist who feels we can learn just as much about Drew if the truth remains under the surface as we could if it were all out in the open.  And in these days of hold-nothing-back, blab-it-all confessionals, that restraint is very much appreciated indeed.",4,underrated human comedy,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,4616,"['Drew', 'Baylor', 'young', 'man', 'weighed', 'down', 'unusually', 'burdensome', 'burden', 'managed', 'single-handedly', 'corporation', 'tune', 'cool', '972,000,000', 'when', 'shoe', 's', 'designed', 'fails', 'catch', 'American', 'public', 'little', 'left', 'live', 'faced', 'public', 'humiliation', 'likes', 'few', 'could', 'ever', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'let', 'alone', 'survive', 'only', 'reasonable', 'thing', 'Drew', 'can', 'think', 'do', 'put', 'quick', 'end', 'suddenly', 'bleak', 'disastrous', 'life', 'However', 'fate', 'intervenes', 'when', 'mid-suicide', 'attempt', 'phone', 'rings', 'news', 'father', 'just', 'died', 'visiting', 'side', 'family', 'Elizabethtown', 'Kentucky', 'Drew', 'forced', 'put', 'off', 'offing', 'only', 'temporarily', 'duty', 'taking', 'care', 'business', 'burying', 'father', 'way', 'there', 'up', 'acquaintance', 'kooky', 'free-spirited', 'stewardess', 'whom', 'develop', 'relationship', 'Meanwhile', 'embraced', 'relatives', 'whom', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'realize', 'just', 'what', 'special', 'man', 'father', 'was', 'people', 'Elizabethtown', 'Elizabethtown', 'was', 'not', 'roaring', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'writer/director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'charming', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'lot', 'Garden', 'State', 'case', 'young', 'man', 'returning', 'not', 'own', 'hometown', 'hometown', 'dad', 'Crowe', 'how', 'make', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'look', 'lightweight', 'easy', 'characters', 'situations', 'though', 'grounded', 'reality', 'always', 'have', 'certain', 'off-kilter', 'quality', 'cockeyed', 'optimism', 'movies', 'wallowing', 'cliches', 'sentimentality', 'Drew', 'Kentucky', 'relatives', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'hicks', 'rubes', 'rather', 'kind-hearted', 'people', 'who', 'slightly', 'suspicious', 'branch', 'family', 'California', 'actually', ""'re"", 'Oregon', 'welcome', 'Drew', 'midst', 'genuine', 'affection', 'hospitality.The', 'romance', 'Drew', 'Claire', 'flighty', 'flight', 'attendant', 'developed', 'great', 'deal', 'emotion', 'charm', 'Claire', 'job', 'life-affirming', 'force', 'scenario', 'articulate', 'Drew', 'what', 'what', 'not', 'important', 'life', 'see', 'creating', 'fiasco', 'business', 'world', 'just', ""n't"", 'rate', 'important', 'when', 'stacked', 'up', 'truly', 'important', 'things', 'love', 'family', 'personal', 'relationships', 'always', 'Crowe', 'message', 'never', 'hammered', 'home', 'filters', 'subtly', 'thoughtful', 'lyrical', 'poem', 'character', 'setting.The', 'movie', 'few', 'wrong', 'notes', 'way', 'mainly', 'scene', 'father', 'memorial', 'service', 'Drew', 'mom', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'eulogy', 'equally', 'unlikely', 'response', 'audience', 'scene', 'bit', 'desperate', 'slapstick', 'not', 'up', 'quality', 'rest', 'material', 'even', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'always', 'delightful', 'watch', 'character', 'fairly', 'underdeveloped', 'film', 'so', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'more', 'tacked-on', 'device', 'genuine', 'person', 'own', 'right', 'made', 'up', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'lead', 'Bloom', 'beautifully', 'Dunst', 'crazy', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'wickedly', 'witty', 'cameo', 'Drew', 'boss', 'ability', 'reduce', 'Drew', 'mere', 'shadow', 'man', 'dripping', 'sarcasm', 'smiling', 'clenched', 'teeth', 'priceless', 'bit', 'satire', 'aimed', 'dehumanization', 'heart', 'corporate', 'world', 'mentality.Some', 'viewers', 'might', 'feel', 'cheated', 'fact', 'Crowe', 'little', 'what', 'kind', 'relationship', 'Drew', 'had', 'dad', 'growing', 'up', 'Drew', 'clearly', 'not', 'bitter', 'son', 'carrying', 'deep-seated', 'resentments', 'adulthood', 'neither', 'seem', 'overly', 'affectionate', 'towards', 'memory', 'father', 'overwhelmed', 'grief', 'passing', 'many', 'ways', 'Crowe', 'back', 'revealing', 'imply', 'revealing', 'information', 'such', 'intimate', 'nature', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'violation', 'sacred', 'bond', 'father', 'son', 'artists', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'choose', 'go', 'route', 'letting', 'audience', 'sordid', 'detail', 'relationship', 'Crowe', 'clearly', 'artist', 'who', 'can', 'learn', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Drew', 'truth', 'surface', 'could', 'were', 'out', 'open', 'days', 'hold-nothing-back', 'blab-it-all', 'confessionals', 'restraint', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated', 'indeed']",N/A

Kirsten Dunst delivers in bringing the whimsical Claire to life, but her character remains a mystery in so many ways, that she might as well be a figment of Drew's imagination, his muse, his guiding light.

At times, he might as well be acting in a quirky British comedy, rather than an American drama.

However, the characters are tremendously sympathetic, the story is moving, and the 'place' is intriguing and likable.Set in Elizabethtown Kentucky (an area I know little about), the film's premise is that in meeting his extended family, learning more about his father, beloved by the entire town, he's ready for a new chapter in his life.  Orlando Bloom plays Drew Baylor, the character who has had a very bad week; first his shoe design totally flops (though I can't believe there was no test marketing to see that the shoe wouldn't sell), and then he gets bad news about his father.On the plane to Elizabethtown, he meets a flight attendant played by the very likable Kirsten Dunst (Claire Colburn).  She somehow knows that they are fated to be together, and she pretty much throws herself at him (maybe she loves shoes?).  Anyway, the film proceeds on this thin plot, but the ride to the end is very likable, somewhat quirky (southern characters are almost always quirky, aren't they???), and always winning.You are pulling for these two to end up together, in spite of a rocky path.Four stars, mainly for the good feeling you'll be left with, and the over-all appealing characters, cinematography and art direction.

Its a film that has very charmly romantic scenes and says all the right things but other scenes that are just plan chaotic. What really bothers me some of the time was that the charactors tend to forget that a person has just died and react very strangly. They don't deal with grief like people do when a loved one dies. In this movie they reminise and tap dance to Moon River. But its a worth movie to watch because of its heart which is in the right place. Some people were annoyed by Kirsten Dunst but I was swept away by her. She was my ideal girl. Sweet, Corky, Charming, and knows how to have a good time.

As his boss, Phil (Alec Baldwin) informs him, rounded up, Drew can say that he lost the company $1 billion dollars.  In fact, the shoe that Drew designed was so bad that one critic claimed that it would cause the next generation of children to go barefoot.  Jobless, dumped by his girlfriend and with nothing to live for, Drew decides to commit suicide.Everything is in place, until Drew receives a phone call from his sister (Judy Greer) informing him that his father, Mitch (Tim Devitt), just died of a heart attack while visiting his relatives in Kentucky.  Since Drew is the oldest, the most successful and the responsible one in the family, it is decided that he should be the one to take his father's blue suit out to Elizabethtown, Kentucky and to make the arrangements to have his father's body returned home to Oregon.So Drew puts his suicide plans on hold and flies out to Kentucky, where he meets the quirky flight attendant Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst), who is a collector of lost causes and self-proclaimed ""substitute"" person.  Drew writes off Claire's interest in him and continues on to Elizabethtown, where he is greated with open arms and affection for just being born the son of Mitch Baylor.  While renewing relationships with relatives he hasn't seen in years, Drew finds himself pouring out his soul to Claire and trying to decide whether he has anything he can offer her.  As the days pass in Elizabethtown, Drew gradually comes to discover a purpose in his life through seeing the examples of the people around him: his mother (Susan Sarandon) who starts taking tap dancing lessons and learning to fix the toilet; his cousin (Paul Schneider), who is trying to become a father and not just a friend to his terror of a son; and Claire, who seems to be able to find joy in everything going on around her, no matter how bad things may appear.Elizabethtown is no Jerry Maguire, but it is still a charming and sweet movie by Cameron Crowe.  Orlando Bloom is outstanding in his first non-action role and did a fine job with his first attempts at playing an American - both in speaking ""American"" English and in moving like a more laid back American guy.  Kirsten Dunst is as quirkily charming as ever and is the perfect foil for Bloom's more serious character.  However, it is the supporting cast who really shine in this film.  My favorite parts of the movie were all in Elizabethtown, whether with the Baylors or the townsfolk.  The best scene by far is the memorial for Mitch Baylor, which was both touching and laugh-out-loud funny.  As always in a Crowe film, the music played a big role and was just perfectly formatted to the film.  While not Crowe's best film, Elizabethtown is definitely worth seeing and is one of those rare films that both parents and teenagers can enjoy simultaneously.",4,Sweetingly Charming & Funny,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,2913,"['Drew', 'Baylor', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'just', 'lost', 'shoe', 'company', '972', 'million', 'dollars', 'boss', 'Phil', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'rounded', 'up', 'Drew', 'can', 'say', 'lost', 'company', '1', 'billion', 'dollars', 'fact', 'shoe', 'Drew', 'designed', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'critic', 'claimed', 'would', 'cause', 'next', 'generation', 'children', 'go', 'barefoot', 'Jobless', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'nothing', 'live', 'Drew', 'commit', 'suicide.Everything', 'place', 'Drew', 'phone', 'call', 'sister', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'informing', 'father', 'Mitch', 'Tim', 'Devitt', 'just', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'visiting', 'relatives', 'Kentucky', 'Drew', 'oldest', 'most', 'successful', 'responsible', 'one', 'family', 'decided', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'take', 'father', 'blue', 'suit', 'Elizabethtown', 'Kentucky', 'make', 'arrangements', 'have', 'father', 'body', 'returned', 'home', 'Oregon.So', 'Drew', 'suicide', 'plans', 'hold', 'out', 'Kentucky', 'where', 'quirky', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Claire', 'Colburn', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'collector', 'lost', 'causes', 'self-proclaimed', 'substitute', 'person', 'Drew', 'Claire', 'interest', 'Elizabethtown', 'where', 'greated', 'open', 'arms', 'affection', 'just', 'being', 'born', 'son', 'Mitch', 'Baylor', 'renewing', 'relationships', 'relatives', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'Drew', 'pouring', 'out', 'soul', 'Claire', 'trying', 'decide', 'anything', 'can', 'offer', 'days', 'pass', 'Elizabethtown', 'Drew', 'gradually', 'discover', 'purpose', 'life', 'seeing', 'examples', 'people', 'mother', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'taking', 'tap', 'dancing', 'lessons', 'learning', 'fix', 'toilet', 'cousin', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'who', 'trying', 'become', 'father', 'not', 'just', 'friend', 'terror', 'son', 'Claire', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'joy', 'everything', 'going', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'may', 'appear.Elizabethtown', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'still', 'charming', 'sweet', 'movie', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'outstanding', 'first', 'non-action', 'role', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'first', 'attempts', 'playing', 'American', 'speaking', 'American', 'English', 'moving', 'more', 'laid', 'back', 'American', 'guy', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'quirkily', 'charming', 'ever', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Bloom', 'more', 'serious', 'character', 'However', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', 'really', 'shine', 'film', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'Elizabethtown', 'Baylors', 'townsfolk', 'best', 'scene', 'far', 'memorial', 'Mitch', 'Baylor', 'was', 'touching', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'always', 'Crowe', 'film', 'music', 'played', 'big', 'role', 'was', 'just', 'perfectly', 'formatted', 'film', 'not', 'Crowe', 'best', 'film', 'Elizabethtown', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'parents', 'teenagers', 'can', 'enjoy', 'simultaneously']",N/A

On the verge of suicide , he learns that his father has died and he must fly to Kentucky to organize the funeral...Like most of Cameron Crowe's other films, ELIZABETHTOWN is at heart the story of a good but slightly inept man who learns to grow up and face the world. As usual, there's a hot, earthy, life-affirming woman on hand, this time a flight attendant named Claire (Kirsten Dunst) who meets Drew on his flight to Kentucky.ELIZABETHTOWN doesn't have much of a plot, it's a collection of small moments involving Drew's relationship with the noisily affectionate Kentucky branch of his family (led by Paul Schneider and Paula Deen), as well as a glimpse of Drew's mother and sister (Susan Sarandon and Judy Greer) dealing with Dad's death back in Oregon. Crowe reserves the most time, of course, for the well-performed scenes between Bloom and Dunst. The dialogue is a little self-conscious, but the sweetness of both performers and Crowe's way with a soundtrack helps.ELIZABETHTOWN is a film made by one man, and I tend to give the benefit of the doubt to filmmakers with a strong individual voice. Crowe clearly drew on personal material for this film, and while there are slow patches (a subplot involving Bruce McGill as a man who may have cheated Drew's father goes nowhere), Crowe overall message of life-affirmation comes through loud and clear. The concluding sequence of ELIZABETHTOWN involves Drew on a Claire-devised cross country road trip, designed to get him out there and livin'. This scene (which includes well-intentioned but irrelevant tributes to Martin Luther King and the Oklahoma City bombing victims) causes the movie to roll to a stop rather than end, but I didn't mind being on this trip.Also with Jessica Biel, Gailard Sartain, Loudon Wainwright, and My Morning Jacket as the band performing at the memorial service...If you have liked Crowe's other films, you will like ELIZABETHTOWN.....Recommended",3,"a 3-star review by Simon Crowe...(sadly, no relation)",1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,2110,"['Early', 'ELIZABETHTOWN', 'Drew', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'fired', 'job', 'shoe', 'company', 'unsuccessful', 'product', 'launch', 'boss', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'almost', 'billion', 'dollars', 'verge', 'suicide', 'father', 'died', 'must', 'fly', 'Kentucky', 'organize', 'funeral', 'most', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'other', 'films', 'ELIZABETHTOWN', 'heart', 'story', 'good', 'slightly', 'inept', 'man', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'face', 'world', 'usual', 'hot', 'earthy', 'life-affirming', 'woman', 'hand', 'time', 'flight', 'attendant', 'named', 'Claire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'Drew', 'flight', 'Kentucky.ELIZABETHTOWN', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'plot', 'collection', 'small', 'moments', 'involving', 'Drew', 'relationship', 'noisily', 'affectionate', 'Kentucky', 'branch', 'family', 'led', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Paula', 'Deen', 'as', 'well', 'glimpse', 'Drew', 'mother', 'sister', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'dealing', 'Dad', 'death', 'back', 'Oregon', 'Crowe', 'reserves', 'most', 'time', 'course', 'well-performed', 'scenes', 'Bloom', 'Dunst', 'dialogue', 'little', 'self-conscious', 'sweetness', 'performers', 'Crowe', 'way', 'soundtrack', 'helps.ELIZABETHTOWN', 'film', 'made', 'one', 'man', 'tend', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'filmmakers', 'strong', 'individual', 'voice', 'Crowe', 'clearly', 'drew', 'personal', 'material', 'film', 'are', 'slow', 'patches', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'cheated', 'Drew', 'father', 'nowhere', 'Crowe', 'overall', 'message', 'life-affirmation', 'loud', 'clear', 'concluding', 'sequence', 'ELIZABETHTOWN', 'Drew', 'Claire-devised', 'cross', 'country', 'road', 'trip', 'designed', 'get', 'there', 'livin', 'scene', 'well-intentioned', 'irrelevant', 'tributes', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'bombing', 'victims', 'movie', 'roll', 'stop', 'rather', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'trip.Also', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Gailard', 'Sartain', 'Loudon', 'Wainwright', 'My', 'Morning', 'Jacket', 'band', 'performing', 'memorial', 'service', 'have', 'liked', 'Crowe', 'other', 'films', 'will', 'like', 'ELIZABETHTOWN', '..Recommended']",N/A

If you value your free time, do not spend it watching Elizabethtown.The overall plot of this movie was silly, and all the sub-plots and side stories came off disjointed.  There was nothing holding Elizabethtown together.  Many questions came to mind(superficial questions, none about the overall moral or theme of the story) during this movie, so many that I was annoyed and felt forced to watch the end, hoping at some point Crowe would tie this disjointed movie back together.  Here are just a few things that came to mind:1)Why was this single designer held accountable for the major loss of money at the shoe company?  That was never really addressed...why didn't management take some heat for letting a bad product be released?  How is $1 billion lost in such a short period of time?2) Why does Claire insist that Drew take exit 60B?  I've driven from Louisville to Elizabethtown many times and never had a problem.  How does Drew drive south for a long period of time, then somehow end up in Indiana?3) When Claire and Drew meet up after talking on the phone all night, why does it take such a short period of time for them to physically meet up?  Earlier, Claire is in the Nashville airport on her way home...she only has 2 hours before her flight to Honolulu, but still has time to meet Drew halfway between Louisville and Nashville (at least a 1.5 hr drive, making a 3hr roundtrip).4) Why does Drew's mom mention some sort of bad dealings with Bob Banyon (or whatever the guy's named), but never elaborate on that?  Crowe hints that this is an important issue, but leaves us hanging...why does the mom hate the dad's family?  What are the issues between Drew and his father?5) When Drew's relatives show him the 'family plot', they say that burial plot has been in his family for 270 years...how did that happen, when white explorers didn't even reach Kentucky until the mid-1700s?  Elizabethtown itself wasn't founded until 1797.I could go on...the movie is truly flawed and downright awful.

Not a fiasco mind you, but it doesn't deliver a cohesive viewing experience.  (Spoiler alert) First of all, linking a business fiasco, the death of a parent, and contemplated suicide to a romance is not an easy thing to do, moodwise. This was my biggest fear, that the movie would get so depressing that it wouldn't be able to rebound.  Fortunately it doesn't fall down into this trap. I think Kirsten Dunst saves the movie in this regard.  Every time her character comes in, the mood lightens, and the movie sparkles more.Second, as some of the other reviewers have noted, we've got 4-5 movies rolled into one -- there's the business failure story, the Elizabethtown story, the death of the father story, the grief story, the romance story, and then it ends with a road trip story.  Personally, I would have edited out Susan Sarandon's entire story line, not because it isn't memorable, but it distracts from the central plot.I have a lot of other issues with the movie, but it boils down to this -- should you buy this DVD, rent it, or not?  It's definitely rentable.  It's very memorable, and the soundtrack is great (definitely buy that).  However, I'm going to have to go with a borderline ""don't buy"" for this one just because the romance supposedly at the heart of the movie is slightly under-written and is overshadowed by some of the other stories.",3,an interesting mess,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,1474,"['Cameron', 'Crowe', 'definitely', 'reach', 'more', 'average', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'interesting', 'failure', 'Not', 'fiasco', 'mind', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'cohesive', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'First', 'linking', 'business', 'fiasco', 'death', 'parent', 'contemplated', 'suicide', 'romance', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'moodwise', 'was', 'biggest', 'fear', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'so', 'depressing', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'rebound', 'Fortunately', ""n't"", 'fall', 'down', 'trap', 'think', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'movie', 'regard', 'Every', 'time', 'character', 'mood', 'lightens', 'movie', 'more.Second', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', ""'ve"", 'got', '4-5', 'movies', 'rolled', 'one', 'business', 'failure', 'story', 'Elizabethtown', 'story', 'death', 'father', 'story', 'grief', 'story', 'romance', 'story', 'then', 'road', 'trip', 'story', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'edited', 'out', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'entire', 'story', 'line', 'not', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'central', 'plot.I', 'have', 'lot', 'other', 'issues', 'movie', 'down', 'should', 'buy', 'DVD', 'rent', 'not', 'definitely', 'rentable', 'very', 'memorable', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'definitely', 'buy', 'However', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'go', 'borderline', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'one', 'just', 'romance', 'supposedly', 'heart', 'movie', 'slightly', 'under-written', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'stories']",N/A

170350,A3M2WW0PO34B94,1415719284,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 11]","From Cameron Crowe's notebook...Notes for ""Elizabethtown II: The Music of Life""1. Must make the relationship between Drew (Orland Bloom) and Claire (Kirsten Dunst) more believable. Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom), a wunderkind at an athletic shoe company in Portland, who gets fired because his newest design will cost the company close to $1 billion dollars, meets Claire (Kirsten Dunst), the irrepressible flight attendant during his flight to Elizabethtown, Kentucky, for his father's funeral. In the first film, they meet during the flight and she practically forces herself upon him. In most romantic comedies, there is a ""meet cute"" scene, where the two people meet in an unexpected, funny way. I wasn't able to come up with that, so I had Claire force herself into Drew's life. The only way this would work even remotely would be for Drew to be a mess. Which is why he fails at his job, in his relationship and he has a strained relationship with his dad, which isn't helped by the fact that he died, so he is a mess. This is the only way anyone would be even remotely attracted to someone as annoying as Claire.In the next film, what will their relationship be? The first film has them getting together (?) and forming a bond. This is why I included a lot of shots of Claire staring at Drew and smiling in a forlorn way. I think it works.Maybe they should be fighting in the beginning of the film and the film is about their journey back together? Yeah, that could work.NOTE: Concerned that all of the characters are defined by buzzwords: suicidal, irrepressible, wunderkind. For sequel, should try to establish more layers for all characters. I used to be able to do this. Watch ""Almost Famous"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" again for inspiration. Don't know what happened.The journey back together could be an excuse for another of Claire's crazy maps. (Check into merchandising possibilities!!!!!) In the first film, as Drew prepares to take his father's ashes back to California, Claire gives him a huge, handmade map including instructions about where to stop, for how long, what to eat, what to appreciate. All set to music she (I!) picked. Talk about your control freaks. She made a couple of dozen CDs to accompany the trip. Great excuse for me to include just about every song I have every enjoyed, in my entire life. The loud, constant music also allows me to cover up any obnoxious dialogue that may not be working.2. Because I have used up all of my favorite songs, there will be fewer to choose from for the sequel, so less music. Which means they will have to talk more. Hmm? Not sure about that.3. Don't understand why the studio wouldn't let me call the film ""Elizabethtown: The Music of Death"". Funny reference to the sheer number of songs on the soundtrack. Great excuse to release multiple soundtracks and make a lot of ancillary revenue. Paramount is so gonna love this. There is so much music on the soundtrack that it will be difficult for many people to sit through, but as the filmmaker, I have to go with my vision.4. Orlando Bloom is a handsome guy, but perhaps I made him too uninteresting. In the sequel, he could go on a journey of extreme sports; hang gliding, zip lining, etc. That would help breathe some life into his character. It would also give them a destination for the road trip.I had too many shots of Bloom doing crazy things with no dialogue. He stops in the middle of the road, dancing on one leg, pumping his fist in the air, because Claire recommended he do this. I think it works, even though Bloom seems a bit manipulated throughout by Claire and the CDs. It was the absolute right decision to have about twenty minutes of the road trip with no dialogue from Bloom, narrated by Kirsten Dunst. Neither is a great actor, but having Dunst narrate Bloom's journey at least makes it interesting. Right?I also think it was absolutely the right decision to have the road trip at the end of the film. The slowest part at the end. Brilliant!!!!In the next film, if they are traveling together, how will I solve this problem?5. Kirsten Dunst is a good actress, but she may have been a little over the top on the first film. Make sure she plays it down in ""II"". From the moment she first appears on screen, she seems inquisitive, at times, she seems crazy. She practically forces herself upon Bloom's Drew. Not sure it worked. Also, the entire film is about their relationship, yet the relationship remains tentative at best, until the very end. It was a bit maddening really, but that's what the audience wants right? I'm sure the 18- 34 demographic that the film is made for will appreciate it. It's a bit like the relationship between Rachel and Ross on ""Friends"". Yay!6. I really like the scenes of Drew interacting with his extended family in Elizabethtown. This seems to be the section of the film that works the best, is the most genuine. How can I get them back to Elizabethtown in the sequel? Or do the country relatives come out to ""California"" and see Drew and his family in Portland, Oregon?The relationship between Drew's cousin Jessie (Paul Schneider), his young son, and his father, Uncle Dale (Loudon Wainright) works really well. We really get a feel for the dynamic of their relationship and how they interact with one another. Paul Deen (from TV's Food Network) appears as Aunt Dora and she does a good job. She is a bit more precocious, but not in an obnoxious way. The southern relatives are, overall, very level and no imbued with the typical stereotypes you would expect. Except for the whole ""California"" thing. Groan. What was I thinking.7. Unfortunately, these are counteracted by the scenes involving Susan Sarandon and Judy Greer as Drew's mom and sister. I guess I went too over the top with these. I thought it would be funny to have Hollie (Sarandon) try to learn how to repair cars, tap dance, etc., as her method of dealing with the grief of losing her husband. I thought she could pull it off. Normally, she is such a great actress. I don't know what happened. But it is definitely all her fault.The scene where Hollie does a little tap dance tribute to her husband? Brilliant!!!8. Thankfully, the film will make money. Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst are like honey to a bee. Bee = 18 - 34 demographic that will flock to the theaters. Sequel will be justified and I can make the film better, correcting all of the problems in the first film.9.

170351,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,1415719284,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[4, 4]","I became interested in this movie throughMy Year of Flops: The A.V. Club Presents One Man's Journey Deep into the Heart of Cinematic Failurewhere Rabin reviewed this movie twice. The first time, he reviewed as the setting for the series on the AV Club, especially the way of judging the movies based on Bloom's speech about how a fiasco is different than a failure because it tries big and loses big. I was rather taken by the fact that after he wrote the MYOF column and when he was writing the book he went back and reviewed the movie again. The first time he reviewed it, he was hung up on the fact that Kristen Dunst is the Manic Magic Pixie Dream Girl and that she's really annoying. The second time, he focused on the main strength of all Cameron Crowe movies and a strength that still comes through in this one; namely the fact that Crowe characters are kinder to each other and sweeter to the world than most people. His main line from the second review was ""I want to live in Cameron Crowe's world.""And that makes this movie rather enjoyable. In fact, it makes pretty much every Crowe movie enjoyable. His characters are nice people. There's the occassional jerk like John Mahoney inSay Anythingand Jay Mohr fromJerry Maguirebut for the most part, the characters inhabit a world where people want to understand each other and they really have each other's best intersts at heart.Orlando Bloom stars as a shoe designer who has created the Edsel of footwear. Alec Baldwin shows up as his boss, a man who is sorry to fire him but also cannot ignore that he just lost the company almost a billion dollars. Just as he's about to kill himself, he gets a call from home saying that his father has died. From there on out, he has to negotiate with his father's family for the body with Susan Sarandon as his mother who never felt accepted by that side of the family. By the end of the movie she's made her peace with the family and she's giving stand up comic routines that double as eulogies for everyone. All tensions vanish in a wave of decency.And then there's Kirsten Dunst. I can't love her because she is a MMPDG and that type is usually bunny boiling irritating. And she is just a little too much of a fantasy for the movie. But eventually she kind of wins me over because it's really hard for that kind not to win you over because that fantasy of a lover who totally wants you and will follow you around and try to make your life better whether you want it or not - it's hard to resist. Sure, if she was more realistic she'd be overdosing on pills and dealing with bulimia and cheating with the next guy like Cassie inSkins, Vol. 1but that would really throw off the movie.So, forget about the bad reviews. If you like other Cameron Crowe movies check this one out. ANd even check out with low expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much you like it.",4,"If you can get over your initial cynicism, it's rather a sweet movie",1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,2876,"['became', 'interested', 'movie', 'throughMy', 'Year', 'Flops', 'A.V', 'Club', 'Presents', 'One', 'Man', 'Journey', 'Deep', 'Heart', 'Cinematic', 'Failurewhere', 'Rabin', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'twice', 'first', 'time', 'reviewed', 'setting', 'series', 'AV', 'Club', 'especially', 'way', 'judging', 'movies', 'based', 'Bloom', 'speech', 'how', 'fiasco', 'different', 'failure', 'big', 'big', 'was', 'rather', 'taken', 'fact', 'wrote', 'MYOF', 'column', 'when', 'was', 'writing', 'book', 'went', 'back', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'reviewed', 'was', 'hung', 'up', 'fact', 'Kristen', 'Dunst', 'Manic', 'Magic', 'Pixie', 'Dream', 'Girl', 'really', 'annoying', 'second', 'time', 'focused', 'main', 'strength', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'movies', 'strength', 'still', 'one', 'namely', 'fact', 'Crowe', 'characters', 'are', 'kinder', 'other', 'sweeter', 'world', 'most', 'people', 'main', 'line', 'second', 'review', 'was', 'want', 'live', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'world', 'movie', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'Crowe', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'are', 'nice', 'people', 'occassional', 'jerk', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'inSay', 'Anythingand', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'fromJerry', 'Maguirebut', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'want', 'understand', 'other', 'really', 'have', 'other', 'best', 'intersts', 'heart.Orlando', 'Bloom', 'shoe', 'designer', 'who', 'created', 'Edsel', 'footwear', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'up', 'boss', 'man', 'who', 'sorry', 'fire', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'ignore', 'just', 'lost', 'company', 'almost', 'billion', 'dollars', 'Just', 'kill', 'call', 'home', 'saying', 'father', 'died', 'there', 'out', 'negotiate', 'father', 'family', 'body', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'mother', 'who', 'never', 'felt', 'accepted', 'side', 'family', 'end', 'movie', 'made', 'peace', 'family', 'giving', 'stand', 'up', 'comic', 'routines', 'double', 'eulogies', 'everyone', 'tensions', 'vanish', 'wave', 'decency.And', 'then', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'MMPDG', 'type', 'usually', 'bunny', 'boiling', 'irritating', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'eventually', 'kind', 'wins', 'really', 'hard', 'kind', 'not', 'win', 'fantasy', 'lover', 'who', 'totally', 'will', 'follow', 'around', 'try', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'want', 'not', 'hard', 'resist', 'Sure', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', ""'d"", 'be', 'overdosing', 'pills', 'dealing', 'bulimia', 'cheating', 'next', 'guy', 'Cassie', 'inSkins', 'Vol', '1but', 'would', 'really', 'throw', 'off', 'movie.So', 'forget', 'bad', 'reviews', 'like', 'other', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'movies', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'even', 'check', 'out', 'low', 'expectations', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much']",N/A

Where that film was rich in subtlties and heart and featured a superbly understated performance by Zach Braff, Elizabethtown forces profound emotions but failed to connect with me emotionaly.Orlando Bloom doesn't have the depth to carry off the character of Drew, a designer at a Nike-esque global corporation held unrealistically responsible for costing the company $1 billion in losses due to a poorly received new sneaker. The CEO was played by a pudgy Alec Baldwin. So far, he's proven himself to be strictly supporting-actor talent and nothing Oscar-worthy. Kirsten Dunst is pixie cute as the bubbly flight attendent who does everything possible that would label a man a stalker, but coming from a woman, we're supposed to buy her character's lavishing of attention on Drew as being flirtatious and romantic. There are women out there who are insanely dynamic and very quickly trusting of complete strangers, but they are so rare that Claire, Dunst's character, sets the tone early on that this film will tell its story without feeling obligated to do so with credibility. And that is its biggest downfall.Shortly after hearing of her husband's death, Hollie (Susan Sarandon)reacts by taking up organic cooking, car repair and tap dancing, all at once. Sure. But wait until Claire shows up at the memorial service and references her neighbor consolling her while his member sprouts, and tap dancing to her deceased husband's favorite song. Happens all the time, right? There are so many unbelievable moments like these that they smother any real warmth that was supposed to emerge.The supporting cast is fine, however. Dunst has genuine charisma. The Kentucky family appeared to be accurately portrayed. Crowe's final chapter with Drew driving home and stopping off along the way, is a loving tribute to heartland America in a travelogue, but the idea behind it the road trip, following a ""map"" put together by Claire is very cheesy and far-fetched. Again.In flashbacks, the young Drew Baylor is played by a couple of actors including one who looked at lot like the character William Miller, the 15 year-old writer featured in Crowe's 2000 hit, Almost Famous.There were no moments when I felt the emotions at anything but a superficial level.

170355,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1415719284,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 8]","One sad thing is that 'Elizabethtown' is directed by Cameron Crowe, whose 'Almost Famous' is still one of the best films ever made about bitter-sweet memories of youth.  It also has Kate Hudson's star-making acting as ""Penny Lane"" and Philip Seymour Hoffman's great talent plus very fresh newcomer Patrick Fugit and of course, Frances McDormand.  So what made him write and direct this rambling and disjointed film?  What part of 'Elizabethtown' did he find so attractive?If you have seen the trailer, you know the thin content of the film, about one American shoe-designer Drew (played by miscast Orlando Bloom) who lost the company's millions of dollars, lost his job, and even his love (Jessica Biel).  When he decides to kill himself (in a very strange way), he knows he also lost his daddy.  In the weak opening, you can see the hand of editor, who anyway tries to make things look coherent.Despite the film's clever one-liners and quirky humor, things just don't get better.  While going to his father's funeral in Lousville, Drew meets a gabby flight attendant Claire (Kirsten Dunst).  Here's a story about a new romance, I know, and here's the death of his father, Ok, it's a contrast, and ... Cameron Crowe just cannot stop there, adding a motif after another, all of which add up to nothing.Yes, I know.  'Elizabethtown' is about life, and its bits are beautifully shot, which sometimes comes with insightful observation of life, but Cameron Crowe cannot hold these bits together.  Big commercial failure might be a great shock to an ordinary American guy, but his father's death and broken promise with him is much more shocking to him.  Into 'Elizabethtown' Crowe throws both of them when one is sufficient.  (And why shoe designer in the first place?)But to me, more irritating thing is the actors and acting.  Who did the biggest mistake?  Susan Sarandon who plays Drew's mother who starts to learn tap dance and gives one of the most embarrassing speech at her husband's funeral?  Kirsten Dunst whose acting is far less credible than MJ in 'Spider-man'?  Or Orlando Bloom whose bland acting fails to convince us of the grief of the death of his father?  Sorry if I sound a bit sarcastic, but recent Cameron Crowe films have got too mainstream while 'Almost Famous,' his best so far, was greatly supported by two newcomers.Surely the soundtrack is a great collection of pop music, but besides that there's nothing I can recommend about 'Elizabethtown.'  I would rather leave and go back to 'Almost Famous' and Penny Lane.",2,"Not a Fiasco, But Still a Failure: Rambling and Disjointed",1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,2535,"['One', 'sad', 'thing', ""'Elizabethtown"", 'directed', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Famous', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'bitter-sweet', 'memories', 'youth', 'also', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'star-making', 'acting', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'great', 'talent', 'very', 'fresh', 'newcomer', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'course', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'what', 'made', 'write', 'direct', 'rambling', 'disjointed', 'film', 'What', 'part', ""'Elizabethtown"", 'did', 'find', 'so', 'attractive', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'know', 'thin', 'content', 'film', 'about', 'one', 'American', 'shoe-designer', 'Drew', 'played', 'miscast', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'who', 'lost', 'company', 'millions', 'dollars', 'lost', 'job', 'even', 'love', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'When', 'kill', 'very', 'strange', 'way', 'also', 'lost', 'daddy', 'weak', 'opening', 'can', 'see', 'hand', 'editor', 'who', 'anyway', 'make', 'things', 'look', 'coherent.Despite', 'film', 'clever', 'one-liners', 'quirky', 'humor', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'going', 'father', 'funeral', 'Lousville', 'Drew', 'gabby', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Claire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Here', 'story', 'new', 'romance', 'know', 'here', 'death', 'father', 'Ok', 'contrast', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'there', 'adding', 'motif', 'add', 'up', 'nothing.Yes', 'know', 'life', 'bits', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'sometimes', 'insightful', 'observation', 'life', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'bits', 'together', 'Big', 'commercial', 'failure', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'shock', 'ordinary', 'American', 'guy', 'father', 'death', 'broken', 'promise', 'much', 'more', 'shocking', 'Into', 'Crowe', 'when', 'one', 'sufficient', 'why', 'shoe', 'designer', 'first', 'place', 'more', 'irritating', 'thing', 'actors', 'acting', 'Who', 'did', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'Drew', 'mother', 'who', 'learn', 'tap', 'dance', 'one', 'most', 'embarrassing', 'speech', 'husband', 'funeral', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'acting', 'far', 'less', 'credible', 'MJ', ""'Spider-man"", 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'bland', 'acting', 'fails', 'convince', 'grief', 'death', 'father', 'Sorry', 'sound', 'bit', 'sarcastic', 'recent', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'films', 'have', 'got', 'too', 'mainstream', 'Famous', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'greatly', 'supported', 'two', 'newcomers.Surely', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'collection', 'pop', 'music', 'nothing', 'can', 'recommend', 'would', 'rather', 'leave', 'go', 'back', ""'Almost"", 'Famous', 'Penny', 'Lane']",N/A
170356,AGLL9FGGXRSH7,1415719284,"T. Williams ""world traveller""","[3, 5]","Elizabethtown is a movie that will grow on you. Full of some amazing songs, a few great performances and a showcasing of the charms (but little of the shortcomings of ""flyover America""), this movie manages to intrigue while it disappoints.And I'm not just saying that 'cause I have a hard time getting past the Orlando Bloom factor.Perhaps its problem is that it is actually three stories (that don't necessarily congeal) in one movie. It begins with the pop psycholgy of the lead character, Bloom as Drew Baylor, exponding upon the corporate rat race (think of Ferris Bueller growing up to work for Apple and you would get the right ""tone"" of the narration). This section is quickly aborted  ... thankfully, since Bloom seems unable to invoke the dark, burning desperation that would fuel his actions in this ""first act"" of the film. (Can one be comatized by ennui and still create a Rube Goldberg suicide machine? I didn't buy it.)The second act of the film is where the movie finally takes off. Perhaps it is the introduciton of the Kirsten Dunst character. Slightly underwritten, Claire breathes life into the Bloom (who seems intent on assuming a glum Buster Keaton deadpan through much of the movie), but also into the movie itself. She is radiantly beautiful. (There are times in the movie when the camera simply rest upon her as she stands and she's able to take the breath away of the men in the audience.) At times her character is over-the-top, but her acting never is. Subtlety seems to have been her secret. Her eyes do most of the best acting in the movie - and (big sigh of relief) her Southern accent is never cloying.The examination of the shock of sudden death, mourning and the gathering of family seems more personal, more real. I may be the only man in America that is baffled by the hoopla over ""Say Anything"" (although it did feature Ione Skye who was ravishing in the recent ""Fever Pitch""), but here Cameron Crowe gets it right. He has written some scenes that actually seem like real life. I recognized the rush of activity and self-diversions (the anything-but-mourning ploys) that follow the sudden death of a person that is key to your happiness ... and sometimes your identity.Finally, after an uneven (not sure about Susan Sarrandon tap-dancing), but hilarious - and rocking - memorial tribute (I will now remember Freebird in a completely differet way), the flim gives way to a road trip movie of all things. It was a nice trip down Route 66, but seriously - wouldnt that time been better spent explaining Claire's attraction to Drew (aside from the fact that he is nearly as pretty as she is)?In the end, the merits of this movie rest in the casting. The first act features Alec Baldwin doing a more zen-friendly, Oregon granola take on his Glengarry Glenn Ross character and the deliciously icy Jessica Biel.Both Susan Sarandon (whose talents are wasted here, but sorely needed) and Judy Greer (who I just figured out played one of my favorite characters in ""The Village"") bring an energy to their scenes that make one wonder if Bloom's character wasn't adopted.The ""Kentucky"" company of players includes the pitch-perfect performances by Loudon Wainwright III and Paul Schneider, plus fine performances by Bruce McGill and the Food Network's Paula Deen (who is basically playing her charming self.)I recommend this movie - but give it a chance to grow on you. It's charms are worth a second viewing.",4,I am beginning to think I am too generous with the star ratings,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,3433,"['Elizabethtown', 'movie', 'will', 'grow', 'Full', 'amazing', 'songs', 'few', 'great', 'performances', 'showcasing', 'charms', 'little', 'shortcomings', 'flyover', 'America', 'movie', 'intrigue', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'saying', ""'cause"", 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'problem', 'actually', 'three', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'congeal', 'one', 'movie', 'pop', 'psycholgy', 'lead', 'character', 'Bloom', 'Drew', 'Baylor', 'exponding', 'corporate', 'rat', 'race', 'think', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'growing', 'up', 'work', 'Apple', 'would', 'get', 'right', 'tone', 'narration', 'section', 'quickly', 'aborted', 'thankfully', 'Bloom', 'unable', 'invoke', 'dark', 'burning', 'desperation', 'would', 'fuel', 'actions', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'Can', 'one', 'be', 'comatized', 'ennui', 'still', 'create', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'suicide', 'machine', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'second', 'act', 'film', 'where', 'movie', 'finally', 'off', 'Perhaps', 'introduciton', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'character', 'Slightly', 'underwritten', 'Claire', 'life', 'Bloom', 'who', 'intent', 'assuming', 'glum', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'much', 'movie', 'also', 'movie', 'radiantly', 'beautiful', 'are', 'times', 'movie', 'when', 'camera', 'simply', 'rest', 'upon', 'able', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'men', 'audience', 'times', 'character', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'never', 'Subtlety', 'have', 'been', 'secret', 'eyes', 'do', 'most', 'best', 'acting', 'movie', 'big', 'sigh', 'relief', 'Southern', 'accent', 'never', 'cloying.The', 'examination', 'shock', 'sudden', 'death', 'mourning', 'gathering', 'family', 'more', 'personal', 'more', 'real', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'man', 'America', 'baffled', 'hoopla', 'Say', 'Anything', 'did', 'feature', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'who', 'was', 'ravishing', 'recent', 'Fever', 'Pitch', 'here', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'right', 'written', 'scenes', 'actually', 'seem', 'real', 'life', 'recognized', 'rush', 'activity', 'self-diversions', 'anything-but-mourning', 'ploys', 'follow', 'sudden', 'death', 'person', 'key', 'happiness', 'sometimes', 'identity.Finally', 'uneven', 'not', 'sure', 'Susan', 'Sarrandon', 'tap-dancing', 'hilarious', 'rocking', 'memorial', 'tribute', 'will', 'now', 'remember', 'Freebird', 'completely', 'differet', 'way', 'flim', 'way', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'things', 'was', 'nice', 'trip', 'Route', '66', 'seriously', 'wouldnt', 'time', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'explaining', 'Claire', 'attraction', 'Drew', 'aside', 'fact', 'nearly', 'as', 'pretty', 'end', 'merits', 'movie', 'rest', 'casting', 'first', 'act', 'features', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'doing', 'more', 'zen-friendly', 'Oregon', 'granola', 'take', 'Glengarry', 'Glenn', 'Ross', 'character', 'deliciously', 'icy', 'Jessica', 'Biel.Both', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'here', 'sorely', 'needed', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'who', 'just', 'figured', 'out', 'played', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Village', 'bring', 'energy', 'scenes', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'Bloom', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'adopted.The', 'Kentucky', 'company', 'players', 'pitch-perfect', 'performances', 'Loudon', 'Wainwright', 'III', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'fine', 'performances', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'Food', 'Network', 'Paula', 'Deen', 'who', 'basically', 'playing', 'charming', 'self', 'recommend', 'movie', 'give', 'chance', 'grow', 'charms', 'are', 'second', 'viewing']",N/A
