162012,A2W75MWKZXJ18P,0800120655,"Anthony Green ""cascode""","[3, 4]","This was a difficult film to review because although it is generally pretty bland there are some aspects I really liked and some I found awful.  Overall I couldn't give it more than 2 stars.Basically, it's a simple action picture about the America's Cup - good solid B-grade material.  The acting is passable, although the actors are weighed down with a terrible script that is full of cliches and stereotypes.  There is no imagination to the characterisation and the film never really engages the viewer.The scenes of sailing are, however, very well filmed and do capture the feeling of yacht racing, and the climax is suitably exciting and satisfying.  Unfortunately the rest of the film is so slow and so full of silly characters and dreadful dialogue that it makes the good bits hardly worth waiting for.But there is one great flaw in this film, and it is unforgivable.  A film such as this can contain fictional characters instead of the actual people who participated in the events, and it can even fictionalise events to a certain degree.  It is essential, however, that major events and characters are not altered because it is these that anchor the film to reality.  Change something important and the film becomes fantasy instead of adventure in an historical setting.For example, suppose the plot of Ron Howard's film ""Apollo XIII"" had the astronauts land on the moon and then the accident that crippled the ship occur on the return leg of the voyage.  The viewer would know that they were no longer watching historical drama, but science fiction instead.Well, that's what ""Wind"" does.  The director never seems to be able to decide whether they were creating a drama about the actual loss and subsequent win of the America's Cup by US teams in the 1980s, or whether they wanted to make a fictional story.For example, in early scenes the US syndicate boss is seen examining and lovingly touching a winged keel on their yacht - implying that it was a US invention.  In reality, it was the winged keel, invented by Australian Ben Lexcen, that was fitted to the Australian challenging yacht and contributed to her capture of the cup.  The America's Cup was also not lost due to a misjudged turn by the defending skipper, as the film implies - it was lost by 5 races to 4 due to the superior skills and technology of the Australian team.  The US boat was simply outraced.Similarly, the cup was won back by the US in the next race, but not by the use of a ""secret weapon"" spinnaker (illegal according to the rules anyway) or an innovative hull design, but simply by good sailing on the part of the US team.  The writers were so concerned with fabricating a love story and creating dramatic situations that they sacrificed the genuine drama and excitement of the race.  They made suspension of disbelief impossible by rewriting historical facts, and that's just plain bad film making.""Wind"" could have been so much more, and in the hands of a good director the flaws in the script could have been reduced, unfortunately Carroll Ballard was not up to the task.  Full marks to the cinematographer, however, for some spectacular shots of yacht racing.",2,"The yacht wins, the film loses",1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,3153,"['was', 'difficult', 'film', 'review', 'generally', 'pretty', 'bland', 'are', 'aspects', 'really', 'liked', 'found', 'awful', 'Overall', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', '2', 'stars.Basically', 'simple', 'action', 'picture', 'America', 'Cup', 'good', 'solid', 'B-grade', 'material', 'acting', 'passable', 'actors', 'are', 'weighed', 'down', 'terrible', 'script', 'full', 'cliches', 'stereotypes', 'imagination', 'characterisation', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'viewer.The', 'scenes', 'sailing', 'are', 'however', 'very', 'well', 'filmed', 'do', 'capture', 'feeling', 'yacht', 'racing', 'climax', 'suitably', 'exciting', 'satisfying', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'film', 'so', 'slow', 'so', 'full', 'silly', 'characters', 'dreadful', 'dialogue', 'good', 'bits', 'hardly', 'worth', 'waiting', 'for.But', 'one', 'great', 'flaw', 'film', 'unforgivable', 'film', 'such', 'can', 'contain', 'fictional', 'characters', 'instead', 'actual', 'people', 'who', 'participated', 'events', 'can', 'even', 'fictionalise', 'events', 'certain', 'degree', 'essential', 'however', 'major', 'events', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'altered', 'anchor', 'film', 'reality', 'Change', 'something', 'important', 'film', 'fantasy', 'instead', 'adventure', 'historical', 'setting.For', 'example', 'suppose', 'plot', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'film', 'Apollo', 'XIII', 'had', 'astronauts', 'land', 'moon', 'then', 'accident', 'crippled', 'ship', 'occur', 'return', 'leg', 'voyage', 'viewer', 'would', 'know', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'watching', 'historical', 'drama', 'science', 'fiction', 'instead.Well', 'what', 'Wind', 'director', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'decide', 'were', 'creating', 'drama', 'actual', 'loss', 'subsequent', 'win', 'America', 'Cup', 'US', 'teams', '1980s', 'wanted', 'make', 'fictional', 'story.For', 'example', 'early', 'scenes', 'US', 'syndicate', 'boss', 'seen', 'examining', 'lovingly', 'touching', 'winged', 'keel', 'yacht', 'implying', 'was', 'US', 'invention', 'reality', 'was', 'winged', 'keel', 'invented', 'Australian', 'Ben', 'Lexcen', 'was', 'fitted', 'Australian', 'challenging', 'yacht', 'contributed', 'capture', 'cup', 'America', 'Cup', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'lost', 'due', 'misjudged', 'turn', 'defending', 'skipper', 'film', 'was', 'lost', '5', 'races', '4', 'due', 'superior', 'skills', 'technology', 'Australian', 'team', 'US', 'boat', 'was', 'simply', 'outraced.Similarly', 'cup', 'was', 'won', 'back', 'US', 'next', 'race', 'not', 'use', 'secret', 'weapon', 'spinnaker', 'illegal', 'according', 'rules', 'anyway', 'innovative', 'hull', 'design', 'simply', 'good', 'sailing', 'part', 'US', 'team', 'writers', 'were', 'so', 'concerned', 'fabricating', 'love', 'story', 'creating', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'sacrificed', 'genuine', 'drama', 'excitement', 'race', 'made', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'impossible', 'rewriting', 'historical', 'facts', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'film', 'making', 'Wind', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'hands', 'good', 'director', 'flaws', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'unfortunately', 'Carroll', 'Ballard', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'Full', 'marks', 'cinematographer', 'however', 'spectacular', 'shots', 'yacht', 'racing']",N/A

162024,A1CVM427QH52BL,0800120655,Michael T Kennedy,"[0, 0]","I usually have a problem with movies that have as the subject something I know a lot about. For that reason, I avoided this movie when it came out. I watched it for the first time last night. The technical aspects were very good, the story was plausible and I really enjoyed it. There were a few minor issues that struck me but they were not big issues. In the 1983 Cup, the Australian boat had a winged keel, which was concealed as long as possible. This was a rating issue as the 12 meter is a flexible design class. If you can design a better boat within the rating parameters, you can win races. A winged keel has wings that incline down at about a 30 degree angle. When the boat heels, the leeward wing is deeper into the water, and the windward wing is near horizontal, giving greater lift and less turbulence. The winglets on 737 airliners are a similar design. Aeronautical engineering is very closely related to sailboat design. There is an annual meeting in Las Vegas called ""The Ancient Interface."" The reason for the name is that sailboats have two foils (or ""wings"") immersed in different liquids. The sails are in air and the keel and rudder are in water. The ""interface"" is the surface of the water. The fact that the movie had Kate be an engineer was very authentic. The only quibble is that, in 1983, the American boat did not have a winged keel.The sailing photography was excellent. I was in Freemantle for the 1987 Cup series. The early scene where they were drifting along with no wind is good sailing scripting except that it doesn't apply to Freemantle. Every day, about 11 am, the wind comes in and is called the ""Freemantle doctor."" Before the wind comes in, it is hot and muggy; when the wind arrives, it blows 30 knots the rest of the day. We were on a spectator boat that was about 150 feet long. I saw green water coming over the bridge, 50 feet in the air. The conditions were wild, which is why Dennis Conner trained his crew in Hawaii. It's the only place in the US with conditions like Freemantle.I wish the 12 meters were back and the crews more amateur than they are now.

She has made a study of aerodynamics in aircraft design and has been applying them to watercraft as a side interest. The team loses the Americas' Cup to Austrailia and the captain disolves the crew.  Matthew Modine's character becomes convinced he can build a better yacht and captain it himself for the next competition to take the trophy from the Aussies. He searches out his long gone girlfriend for her design help and gets together financing for his project. Since he is captain of the crew, he then puts his female friend on it. When the race is on and disasters keep happening one after another, she is able to figure out the next moves where no one else can. The standout of this movie are the overhead shots during all of the races, the fluid beauty of the neck and neck racing shots. Nothing like it has ever been accomplished before. Matthew Modine is great, and very young  looking in this movie.

162027,A2WYRV65JIZK7E,0800120655,"Pierce Amory ""Amory""","[8, 18]","Although the sailing scenes include some of the best fictional footage I've seen, this is one of the silliest stories in moviedom. ""Wind"" forces hard core sailors to suffer through hours of quasi-romantic drivel to view 10 to 15 minutes of pseudo-America's Cup racing.I recently rewatched one of the sailing scenes while channel surfing.  What started out as a pretty sailboat cool race with both yachts beating to the windwdward mark in high winds and heavy seas.  It then degenerates when a crew member is hoisted to the top of the mast to fix a mainsail whose luff had torn out of the mast (in some camera shots and not in others).  Now how would one man, even Aronold Schwartzenegger, do that all by himself in high wind?  Just grab it and put it back in?  If you've ever been near a wildly luffing mainsail on a 60 foot mast in high wind you'd know it was mpossible.  The credible (and quicker) procedure would have been to drop and re-hoist the mainsail or, if necessary, a replacement sail.But that wouldn't have provided the psychodrama that the writers were shooting for.  Naturally the crew member gets badly hurt while up there, demonstrating both poor judgment and lack of compassion on the part of the bad dad and skipper (Cliff Robertson).This romantic fantasy strains credulity in alomost every imaginable way.  Will the America's Cup skipper reunite with his lady love?  Will her rich nasty dad come through in the pinch and support their America's Cup team?A man who knows nothing about sailing designs, in short order and on a shoestring budget, an America's Cup winner in the desert?  The daughter designs breakthrough sails of nylon when competitors are using kevlar and other hi-tech materials?  The crew pulling an all-nighter on the eve of the final race and marching across town at dawn to step their spare mast on the opponent's boat?  After all, doesn't love conquer all?The love quadrangle (a triangle isn't good enough?) is formulaic and the romantic scenes laughably lyrical.",1,"Great Sailing Scenes, Silly Movie",1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,2004,"['sailing', 'scenes', 'include', 'best', 'fictional', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'silliest', 'stories', 'moviedom', 'forces', 'hard', 'core', 'sailors', 'suffer', 'hours', 'quasi-romantic', 'drivel', 'view', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'pseudo-America', 'Cup', 'racing.I', 'recently', 'rewatched', 'one', 'sailing', 'scenes', 'channel', 'surfing', 'What', 'started', 'out', 'pretty', 'sailboat', 'cool', 'race', 'yachts', 'beating', 'windwdward', 'mark', 'high', 'winds', 'heavy', 'seas', 'then', 'when', 'crew', 'member', 'hoisted', 'top', 'mast', 'fix', 'mainsail', 'luff', 'had', 'torn', 'mast', 'camera', 'shots', 'not', 'others', 'Now', 'how', 'would', 'one', 'man', 'even', 'Aronold', 'Schwartzenegger', 'do', 'high', 'wind', 'Just', 'grab', 'put', 'back', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'wildly', 'luffing', 'mainsail', '60', 'foot', 'mast', 'high', 'wind', ""'d"", 'know', 'was', 'mpossible', 'credible', 'quicker', 'procedure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'drop', 're-hoist', 'mainsail', 'necessary', 'replacement', 'sail.But', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'provided', 'psychodrama', 'writers', 'were', 'shooting', 'Naturally', 'crew', 'member', 'badly', 'hurt', 'there', 'demonstrating', 'poor', 'judgment', 'lack', 'compassion', 'part', 'bad', 'dad', 'skipper', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'strains', 'credulity', 'alomost', 'imaginable', 'way', 'Will', 'America', 'Cup', 'reunite', 'lady', 'love', 'Will', 'rich', 'nasty', 'dad', 'come', 'pinch', 'support', 'America', 'Cup', 'team', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'sailing', 'designs', 'short', 'order', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'America', 'Cup', 'winner', 'desert', 'daughter', 'sails', 'nylon', 'when', 'competitors', 'are', 'using', 'kevlar', 'other', 'hi-tech', 'materials', 'crew', 'pulling', 'all-nighter', 'eve', 'final', 'race', 'marching', 'town', 'dawn', 'step', 'spare', 'mast', 'opponent', 'boat', ""n't"", 'love', 'conquer', 'love', 'quadrangle', 'triangle', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'formulaic', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'laughably', 'lyrical']",N/A
