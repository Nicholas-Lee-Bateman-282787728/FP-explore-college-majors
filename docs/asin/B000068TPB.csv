He also has this unpopular girl as his friend (who happnes to have a crush on him), and has a crush on the most beautiful &amp; popular girl in school, who couldn't care less about him. Suddenly, the guy discovers he had inherited the family 'curse' - he is a werewolf. After the initial scare, he finds out he can use it to his advantage - he helps his sports team win, which makes him popular, which attracts the beautiful &amp; popular girlfriend, which makes her boyfriend (who is, incidentaly, on the opposite team) mad, which leads to a big fight, which leads our protagonist to the conclusion that he had abused his power as a werewolf and the importance of team work. This leads to a confrontation with some sort of an authority figure, but eventually the team (lead and inpired by the protagonist) wins the day, and the guy gets together with the geeky girl he discovers he liked all along.Since this can describe both the movies, the unoriginal &amp; repeated story line is the biggest fault I could find with the Teen Wolf 2 movie. OK, that and the fact Michael J. Fox (who made the most of the 1st film) wasn't in it.These are typical early tot mid 80's teen dramas, and the fun in them (at least for me) is the memories rather than the story and the laughs.

It's an interesting spin on ""The Wolf Man."" Michael J. Fox portrays the interesting aspects of an underdog high school student who is first annoyed by his condition, then enjoys it, and then develops too much of an ego, and then comes back to center.I feel obligated to mention Michael J. Fox's 2 friends Boof and Styles. Boof is convincing as the 'not most sought after girl,' but the one a sane man would feel better about going out with (as opposed to the official hottest girl) Pam. Styles is likable as the guy always looking to make a few extra dollars.And of course Mr. Hampton is really likable as Michael's father. (He not only has knowledge of the condition, but he offers insight, and even some profound moments when he explains a moment when he was more frightened than the man he fought with.)It's probably not Michael J. Fox's most famous movie, but it's worth a watch.""Teen Wolf Too"" didn't quite live up to the first. (Some people would say I worded it mildly.)

I would give Teen Wolf Too probably 2 stars for lack of unoriginality and a horrid song and dance sequence.  But if you want to get the original Teen Wolf, you might as well get both at time for basically the same price.  And for the reviewer that was wondering why Michael J Fox made this movie after a successful Back To The Future movie, the reason is this.  He actually was shooting Teen Wolf before he got the part for B2TF.  But Teen Wolf actually came out after B2TF, even though he filmed before.  SO despite being on TV, Fox wasn't a movie star yet.  But Teen Wolf is one of those fun 80's movies that has a nostalgic feeling.  Yes, there are tons of plot holes, but who cares?  If you haven't seen this movie, you probably won't like it as much as those of us who watched it when it first came out.  And if you have seen it, get it.  Just Teen Wolf Too once for a good laugh and then avoid it like the plague.

705408,A10DQWWRKGQ6FY,B000068TPB,"Eric B. Gordon ""The greatest thing we ever ha...","[0, 0]","Here's a pairing of two rather unique movies on a dual-side DVD, the original Teen Wolf staring Michael J. Fox and its less-successful sequel, Teen Wolf Too with Jason Bateman.  The first film deals with the struggles of Scott Howard, a high school student fed up with being average, until he discovers he's inherited a fantastic gift; moments of heightened emotional state transform him into The Wolf.  The real problem is how he lets it affect his social life, his academic life and his athletic life . . . and what he has to do to overcome the problem.Teen Wolf Too is the lesser-known story of a cousin named Todd Howard trying to cope with the pressures of being a college freshman, tied in with an unexpected athletic responsibility (as a boxer) and the burden of living up to the events of the previous story.  He thinks he didn't receive the capacity to turn into a wolf the way Scott did, and he's completely surprised to discover that The Wolf is a part of him.  Not only does being the wolf help Todd to excel in the ring, but he gets stuck up and allows the same things to happen to himself that happened to Scott.When I first saw this DVD package, I didn't even know about Teen Wolf Too.  When I watched Too, I did enjoy it a good deal.  At the same time, I have to admit to knowing what prevented it from being more commercially successful.  People had already seen much of that film's turns of events in the original (down to Jason Bateman's voice turning demonic in the registrar's office, something which happened with Fox).  One key element that differs from the original film is that Todd Howard's biology professor is highly supportive of Todd, even when his performance plummets.  Her secret is revealed to the dean near the end of the film - that The Wolf is also a part of her.Another difference is that, when the original was produced, the songs woven into the score were all composed by film scorer Miles Goodman and lyricist Douglas Brayfield (save the Beach Boys' ""Surfin' USA"").  Teen Wolf Too depended more heavily on non-original music than on its own score.The significance of these two films being packaged together lies largely in the show, Family Ties, in which Jason Bateman's older sister, Justine starred as one of Michael J. Fox' sisters.  Jason was also a cast member of Little House on the Prairie at the close of Season 7 and during all Season 8; boss and star Michael Landon also starred in I was a Teenage Werewolf in 1957.  (In addition, five years previous to the original Teen Wolf, Michael J Fox had debuted in the Disney film Midnight Madness with David Naughton, who reached worldwide acclaim in An American Werewolf in London during 1981.)",5,How to be a teen wolf twice,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",2009,2689,"['Here', 'pairing', 'two', 'rather', 'unique', 'movies', 'dual-side', 'DVD', 'original', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'staring', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'less-successful', 'sequel', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'Too', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'first', 'film', 'deals', 'struggles', 'Scott', 'Howard', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'fed', 'up', 'being', 'average', 'inherited', 'fantastic', 'gift', 'moments', 'heightened', 'emotional', 'state', 'transform', 'Wolf', 'real', 'problem', 'how', 'affect', 'social', 'life', 'academic', 'life', 'athletic', 'life', 'what', 'do', 'overcome', 'problem.Teen', 'Wolf', 'Too', 'lesser-known', 'story', 'cousin', 'named', 'Todd', 'Howard', 'trying', 'cope', 'pressures', 'being', 'college', 'freshman', 'tied', 'unexpected', 'athletic', 'responsibility', 'boxer', 'burden', 'living', 'up', 'events', 'previous', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'capacity', 'turn', 'wolf', 'way', 'Scott', 'did', 'completely', 'surprised', 'discover', 'Wolf', 'part', 'Not', 'only', 'being', 'wolf', 'help', 'Todd', 'excel', 'ring', 'stuck', 'up', 'same', 'things', 'happen', 'happened', 'Scott.When', 'first', 'saw', 'DVD', 'package', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'Too', 'When', 'watched', 'Too', 'did', 'enjoy', 'good', 'deal', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'admit', 'knowing', 'what', 'prevented', 'being', 'more', 'commercially', 'successful', 'People', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'much', 'film', 'turns', 'events', 'original', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'voice', 'turning', 'demonic', 'registrar', 'office', 'something', 'happened', 'Fox', 'One', 'key', 'element', 'differs', 'original', 'film', 'Todd', 'Howard', 'biology', 'professor', 'highly', 'supportive', 'Todd', 'even', 'when', 'performance', 'plummets', 'secret', 'revealed', 'dean', 'end', 'film', 'Wolf', 'also', 'part', 'her.Another', 'difference', 'when', 'original', 'was', 'produced', 'songs', 'woven', 'score', 'were', 'composed', 'film', 'scorer', 'Miles', 'Goodman', 'lyricist', 'Douglas', 'Brayfield', 'save', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Surfin', 'USA', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'Too', 'depended', 'more', 'heavily', 'non-original', 'music', 'own', 'score.The', 'significance', 'two', 'films', 'being', 'packaged', 'together', 'largely', 'show', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'older', 'sister', 'Justine', 'starred', 'one', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'sisters', 'Jason', 'was', 'also', 'cast', 'member', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'close', 'Season', '7', 'Season', '8', 'boss', 'star', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'also', 'starred', 'was', 'Teenage', 'Werewolf', '1957', 'addition', 'five', 'years', 'previous', 'original', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'had', 'debuted', 'Disney', 'film', 'Midnight', 'Madness', 'David', 'Naughton', 'who', 'reached', 'worldwide', 'acclaim', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', '1981']",Teen Wolf & Teen Wolf Too

He's an outstanding actor who should've made more movies in the 80's, not just been on sitcoms!  I have just finished watching ""TWT"" and well deserves more praise than what he's gotten in the past!  The story goes as Todd Howard (Jason Bateman) is about to enter college where he finds himself turning into a wolf and has a personality change because of it.  He falls in love with a girl who helps him realize that he just needs to be himself and to forget about being a wolf.  In time he realizes that his girlfriend is right and the fight scene at the end is where he truly decides that anything is possible without a split personality.I've seen the first Teen Wolf with Michael J Fox and I don't find it as good as the second.  I don't know why there was never a Teen Wolf 3 with more of Jason Bateman!!!  I highly recommend this to all Jason Bateman fans (like myself) who want to watch a good 80's movie.

705421,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000068TPB,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 2]","I love this release from MGM to release movies like this as a double feature (2 movies on one disc). I loved the first movie starring Michael J Fox as Scott Howard, a complete looser in high school on a struggling basketball team who one night inherits the family genes and discovers he is a werewolf. And finds out that werewolves aren't like they have been portrayed in movies, but have some great powers.Teen Wolf Too starring Jason Bateman is one I used to watch as a kid. But then seeing it again I released it wasn't a great movie, tho it's not that bad, I think it gets stinking reviews because it's not M.J.F in it, instead it is supposed to be Scott's cousin, Todd Howard. I think the only mistake they made was trying to pass off 2 new and totally different actors to play the roles of Styles & The Couch. But over all, I think the movie was ok, it was not as good as the first, and was basically the same plot as the first one, but in the boxing field instead of Basketball and much the same things happening as in the 1st movie, but if you give it a ago, I'm sure everyone has seen worse movies before. It has copped a pretty bad rep for a while, but is it really so bad? It's just a movie for fun. And I think the soundtrack is pretty good for part 2.But I do admit, I think the only way MGM would have gotten this sequel to sell if they put it on DVD would be how they have done it here as a double feature on a flip side disc. If they sold them individually, Teen Wolf Too would in the 20 cent bin eventually and still wouldn't have been picked up and even looked at much. But please, give it a go, it's really not so bad, it's ok for a sequel, could've been worse.I'd have loved to see a 3rd Sequel for Teen Wolf. I always believe if you make a 2nd one, make a 3rd to round it off nicely, even if it's a bad, bad film, take Robocop 3 for example. There was a Teen Wolf ""cartoon"" made with both the teens Scott and Todd in it, I think? Maybe that would be an idea for a 3rd sequel. Or maybe get in Michael Jackson to star in it, he wouldn't require make up!!! Oh, no wait...sorry, that's monkeys from ""Planet of the apes"" I was thinking of, not Werewolves. Maybe someday we will see Teen Wolf 3, maybe little Bart might actually play the role, who knows?

705423,A228JH8V9Y700G,B000068TPB,MortensOrchid,"[6, 11]","I remembered thinking at the time when the first Teen Wolf movie was released what an odd movie that was for Michael J Fox to have appeared in.  He was riding high from the success of the first Back To The Future movie plus he was already cemented in his TV success of Family Ties.  I realize now that they released this otherwise dud to profit from these things, and it worked as this movie had a healthy turn out when it otherwise wouldn't have.Michael J Fox plays Scott, a lovable Joe Average high schooler who is frustrated with his status in life.  He plays on a basketball team that never wins (and if they're incorporating players 5 feet tall or shorter, why would they win?), has a crush on the prettiest girl in school who never gives him the time of day, wants to purchase at the liquor store but can never get past the crotchety old fart behind the counter.  And he's fed up.  He wants a change, but he gets far more than he barganed for.  One night after a party, Scott changes into a werewolf.  He discovers that his father is one as well and adding to his further gawky adjustment he had this to contend with as well.  Once this is discovered at school, he becomes an instant celebrity and popular.  The people don't like Scott, they only like his wolf persona, he learns a lesson to appreciate only the more genuine people (pushing aside pretty princess Pamela for Boof, his longtime friend) and how shallow and unrewarding being his popular self was.It was an ok story, but it had been done hundreds of times before and since.  The make up job they did on Michael J Fox was wonderful, especially the total body, but he came off looking more cute than scary.  I was expecting hideous but it was trying to get scared by the Easter Bunny.  I disliked this movie so intensely because of Pamela, the gal he was hot for.  From the moment she was introduced she was an absolute shrew and wondered why he would ever give a vain, narcistic princess like her the time of day.  And her boyfriend!  He was borderline bipolar!  But then again, why would he (let alone anyone in real life) go for someone who is actually a good person rather than a complete jerk?  Tis the Bad Boy/Girl syndrome.  The best part of this movie was his wacky sidekick Styles.  All of his hairbrained schemes backfired or went a little south, his T shirts were raunchy and nasty, and he was the life of the party wherever they went.  They made just an ok buddy comedy duo, as Michael J Fox was far too stiff to be a good strait man against him.  It was also disappointing that they didn't utilize Styles more.The lesson here is the that power corrupts.  Once MJF was given the keys to the kingdom, he abused his new power until he was cut down and made to feel a fool.  He got all the new attention from those he wished he could impress, then finds out they are terrible people after all.  And that woman he wished he could have Pamela?  Nothing but a gold digging, power hungry social climber.  He does, rather predictably, make the right choices in the end, but it's still a good and appropriate lesson we have to learn no matter what the case may be.And Teen Wolf II?  Oh, that just gave me a migraine.  It was the exact same movie except it took place in college and the sport was boxing rather than basketball.  And Jason Bateman is right on!  He plays a goofy voice of reason on a clever show today, Arrested Developement, but his talent was wasted on this tripe.  Enjoy it for some lite entertainment, but not much else.",2,Where's my ice pack?

705427,AYYOPF6RG019D,B000068TPB,The Mechanic,"[2, 3]","This movie is funny becaue of Jerry Levine.  His character (Styles) is far and away the funniest thing about this movie.  With repeated viewings, the movie as a whole isn't as interesting, but certain lines and scenes never stop being funny, and, for some reason, I like the ending too.  Jerry Levine's agent should have parlayed Levine's role here into a comedy career for Levine, but that never happened.  Michael J. Fox gives a typical performance, but it's affecting, and sincere.  The basketball scenes are hysterical, particularly in light of his lack of height and basketball skills.  The supporting cast is good, with Styles leading the way as top WOLF BUDDY.  I recommend it for Levine's performance and a handful of great one liners.  As far as the sequel goes, stick to reruns of The Hogan Family if you want to see Jason Bateman in the 80s-",4,GIVE ME A KEG OF BEER!!!,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,852,"['movie', 'funny', 'becaue', 'Jerry', 'Levine', 'character', 'Styles', 'far', 'away', 'funniest', 'thing', 'movie', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'movie', 'whole', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'certain', 'lines', 'scenes', 'never', 'stop', 'being', 'funny', 'reason', 'like', 'ending', 'too', 'Jerry', 'Levine', 'agent', 'should', 'have', 'parlayed', 'Levine', 'role', 'here', 'comedy', 'career', 'Levine', 'never', 'happened', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'typical', 'performance', 'affecting', 'sincere', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'are', 'hysterical', 'particularly', 'light', 'lack', 'height', 'basketball', 'skills', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'Styles', 'leading', 'way', 'top', 'WOLF', 'BUDDY', 'recommend', 'Levine', 'performance', 'handful', 'great', 'one', 'liners', 'As', 'far', 'sequel', 'stick', 'reruns', 'Hogan', 'Family', 'want', 'see', 'Jason', 'Bateman', '80s-']",Teen Wolf & Teen Wolf Too

Fox plays Scott Howard, a loser high schooler who plays on a basketball team that never wins, has a crush on the cutest girl in school, Pamela Wells (she ignores him like the plague), who by the way is dating the most popular hunk in school Mick McAllister, and always has trouble getting beer. So, one night, when he's at a party with his best friends Boof and Styles, something odd happens to Scott. As if he didn't have enough problems...guess what? He's turning into a werewolf! Now Scott has to make sure he can keep his secret! He makes sure to avoid classmates and friends, as well as vice principal Rusty Thorne (who has a grudge against Scott's father, Harold Howard)! However, during a game, Scott turns into the werewolf, and his secret is out. Now, he can play basketball like never before, and gain popularity! While he helps his team win the games, he finally has luck with Pamela, who has taken a new interest in him. It's now up to Scott to choose friends before fame.
