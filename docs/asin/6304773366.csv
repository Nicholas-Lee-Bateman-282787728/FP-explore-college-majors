I guess THEY didn't grow up watching this kind of stuff and don't  have those fond memories (which explains the 4 stars).  The night me and my family got cable tv in the early 80s (first ones in the neighborhood) this hilarious flick was on.  Nudity on the boob tube was still something new to us.  So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.  Plus, anything with Scatman Crothers (The Shining, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Twilight Zone: The Movie) is worth seeing.  This could be the 1982 equivalent of movies like American Pie.  Just leave your brain at the door, pop this in the machine and you'll find much to enjoy on a lazy saturday afternoon.  Try a triple feature with Sixteen Candles and Just One of The Guys (or Weird Science and The Breakfast Club).NOTES:  The sign outside the music store says ""8 Tracks"".  I feel so OLD!!

What will he do with his new power? And will him and his fellow nerdy classmate get together and stay together by the end credits?That about sums up the plot, and it is a silly one.

Plus this is another one of those films where I was confused about what kind of audience they were reaching out to.  It's got all the appeal of a pre-teen fantasy comedy, but then again there was nudity and marijuana scenes, which gave this film an R rating.  But, I was about 20 when I first saw it in the theatre and I was still the kind of guy who enjoyed watching the ""ABC Afternoon Specials"" so I guess I'll always be a kid at heart.For those of you concerned when you read the info above, This DVD does have both the Full Screen and the Widescreen (1:85) version of this film.

There's not much plot to speak of: Barney (one-time teen heartthrob Scott Baio) uses his powers to win a baseball game, get back at his oppressive parents (who try to have him exorcised), and help his best pal Peyton (Willie Aames, Eight is Enough) get laid with the aforementioned busty cheerleader (buxom blonde Heather Thomas, The Fall Guy).Along the way there are peculiar fantasy sequences about Star Trek and Einstein, as well as a strangely drawn-out subplot about the school principal (Robert Mandan, Soap) placing a personal ad. ZAPPED is sprinkled with nudity and four-letter words, but what's even more striking is how the budding relationship between Barney and would-be reporter Bernadette (Felice Schachter, The Facts of Life) feels genuine and sincere--far moreso than the plastic, prefabricated romance of contemporary teen comedy. In fact, up until the berserk prom sequence when Barney goes into a weird, horndog-CARRIE frenzy of telekinetic clothing removal, ZAPPED is surprisingly sweet and will provide a dose of warm nostalgia for guys who grew up watching these movies.This comedy flick takes me back to memory lane to when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1982 when I was 9 going on 10 years old in the 4th grade when we had all those budget cuts going on, due to the recession we had in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president.",5,Breaking all the rules!,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,1850,"['When', 'high-school', 'science', 'nerd', 'Barney', 'Springboro', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'power', 'move', 'objects', 'mind', 'immediately', 'burst', 'buttons', 'busty', 'cheerleader', 'fuzzy', 'pink', 'sweater.Welcome', 'ZAPPED', 'classic', 'example', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedies', '1980s', 'such', 'PORKY', 'PRIVATE', 'RESORT', 'REVENGE', 'THE', 'NERDS', 'FAST', 'TIMES', 'AT', 'RIDGEMONT', 'HIGH', 'PRIVATE', 'SCHOOL', 'etc', 'combining', 'awkward', 'adolescent', 'romance', 'breast', 'obsession', 'somehow', 'leering', 'innocent', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'speak', 'Barney', 'one-time', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'powers', 'win', 'baseball', 'game', 'get', 'back', 'oppressive', 'parents', 'who', 'try', 'have', 'exorcised', 'help', 'best', 'pal', 'Peyton', 'Willie', 'Aames', 'Eight', 'Enough', 'get', 'laid', 'aforementioned', 'busty', 'cheerleader', 'buxom', 'blonde', 'Heather', 'Thomas', 'Fall', 'Guy', '.Along', 'way', 'are', 'peculiar', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Einstein', 'as', 'well', 'strangely', 'drawn-out', 'subplot', 'school', 'principal', 'Robert', 'Mandan', 'Soap', 'placing', 'personal', 'ad', 'ZAPPED', 'sprinkled', 'nudity', 'four-letter', 'words', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'striking', 'how', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Barney', 'would-be', 'reporter', 'Bernadette', 'Felice', 'Schachter', 'Facts', 'Life', 'genuine', 'sincere', 'far', 'moreso', 'plastic', 'prefabricated', 'romance', 'contemporary', 'teen', 'comedy', 'fact', 'up', 'berserk', 'prom', 'sequence', 'when', 'Barney', 'weird', 'horndog-CARRIE', 'frenzy', 'telekinetic', 'clothing', 'removal', 'ZAPPED', 'surprisingly', 'sweet', 'will', 'provide', 'dose', 'warm', 'nostalgia', 'guys', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'movies.This', 'comedy', 'flick', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Summer', '1982', 'when', 'was', '9', 'going', '10', 'years', 'old', '4th', 'grade', 'when', 'had', 'budget', 'cuts', 'going', 'due', 'recession', 'had', '1981-1982', 'when', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'president']",Zapped VHS

Well in ""Zapped"" he is a nice guy, but with a twist, he has telekinetic powers via an experiment done in a high school laboratory.  Then he sort of takes out his frustrations out on people who annoy him or have made his life miserable.

But this, 1982, Scott Baio vehicle , was never intended to be taken seriously. Directed by 80's teen movie director , Bob Rosenthal , "" Zapped "" , tells the story of a young teenager, named Barney, who gains telekenetic abilitites , after a high school laboratory accident. Barney and his best friend , played by Willie Aames , proceed to take advantage of this newly discovered ability by gaining control over bullies , gambling , and gorgeous girls. With a plot like that , would you expect "" Terms of Endearment "" ? No , certainly not. Whereas , tons of films came out in the same vein like 1983's "" Spring Break "" and 1982's "" Fast Times at Ridgemont High "", "" Zapped "" exemplifies the 80's era of teen movies with it's brazen silliness and carefree plots.If you can view the film for what it is , you'll find it, somewhat, brainlessly entertaining. And even if you don't , the supporting cast like Scatman Crothers , Heather Thomas , Mews Small ,Robert Mandan , and Felice Schacter, help suspend your belief, for the film's, 98 minutes. The film contains some adult language , brief nudity and drug references , but could easily receive a PG-13 rating , by today's standards.
