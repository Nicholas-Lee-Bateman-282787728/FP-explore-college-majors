Their journey is humorous and sometimes poignant, and the two eventually come to an understanding and grow fond of each other.  The reason James Garner is running from the Calvary is not given until toward the end of the movie, and it's not what you might expect, and makes you respect his character more.

That means you have a very white washed, comedic view of what is happening. In essence this is a ""family gathering up"" story, involving a guy and his ""son"", meeting up with a lady and her daughter. Cute romance is sure to follow.First, the guy and son. James Garner is Keyes, who deserted from the army - but of course it was for a noble cause. He quickly runs into Mark, a kid who at first glance *looks* like an Indian, but of course he isn't. He was a white boy captured by the Cheyenne natives, who is now free again. The two have a mother-daughter pair of camels who are adoringly ornery.Off they go in the Utah desert, worrying about both Indians and the army. There are typical hijinks and horseplay as they go. They soon run into a gorgeous blonde lady and her equally gorgeous blonde daughter. Keyes falls for the lady. Mark thinks the girl has cooties.Of course, in true Disney fashion, everything works out lovely for all involved, with a few spots of age-appropriate minor sadness.This is a super movie for young tykes, with pretty much zero swearing, violence, or other nastiness that has infiltrated modern media. However, from the point of view of this involving ""one little indian"" - they could have done *Far* better. Why not have had the child actually BE an Indian?

Bernard also directed ""The Bears and I"", ""Napoleon and Samantha"", as well as ""The Boy and the Bronc Buster"". Filming took place near Kanab, Utah. The film pulls together a stellar cast including James Garner, Vera Miles, Jodie Foster, Jay Silverheels, Jim Davis and Clay O'Brian . Jodie Foster appeared in 4 Disney theatrical movies during this period, and 1 television movie for Disney, ""Menace on the Mountain"". Jodie Foster broke her ankle during filming, one of a series of mishaps on the project including a flood, a fire, stuntman injuries, and lightning striking a plane carrying the cast and crew. There actually was a testing program for the suitability of stylizing camels in the southwest states by the U.S. Calvary during the period the movie is portraying. Released in theatres on June 20, 1973 well after the passing of Mr. Walt Disney. It was aired as a two episode story on the Disney weekly television show ""Wonderful World of Disney on NBC on September 26, and October 3, 1976. It was first released to VHS in 1986 in the Disney clamshell, prior to the 200 release by Anchor Bay. Anchor Bay remastered the video image and sound, and released a widescreen VHS version as well. 91 minutes in length. He film is a bit slow at times, but enjoyable overall, suitable for all ages.THE STORY: When a U.S. Cavalryman attempts to intercede in a massacre of a village, he is branded an outlaw charged with mutiny. He flees towards old Mexico with U.S. property, two camels Rosie and her calf, Thirsty. Along the way he reluctantly befriends a 10 year old named Mark, raised by Indians, who is also on the run.

James Garner was in a transitional period here, dabbling with TV and high-grade B-movies like Those Daring Dobermans. He's just as charming as ever, which seems out of place since he IS a deserter. However, as the script is a timely one, his only ""crime"" was disrupting a massacre of a peaceful Indian camp. So perhaps for the only time in history, we have Viet Nam, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, and Jodie Foster coinciding in spacetime.Several things make this a good movie. An early tip off to the quality is a first-rate Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. Next, and most important, Clay O'brien is a very appealing child actor. Add Jodie Foster to the young'un cast and you've got a nice set of kids. Not only that, but the supporting cast is loaded with familiar faces if you're a Western fan. The only shortcoming is there are too few scenes with Vera Miles. I wish the interlude between her and Mr. Garner had lasted longer. In breaking with current tradition, Andrew Prine plays a clergyman who is honest, sympathetic, and Godly. Hollywood hasn't heard of anything like that in decades! And as for the camel(s), it is not just a gimmick, but is really relevant to the plotline. I suppose if the camel had belched or farted, the movie would appeal more to kids today, but thank God there was once a time when they considered that too vulgar.

When a person is in the military, and they are given orders they have difficulty with, do they obey their commander, or their conscience?  Would they be willing to go with what they believe against orders, even if they would be executed for it?This movie was made at the end of the Cowboys are the good guys and Indians are the bad guys era. It is much more historically accurate, and shows things from the Indians point of view also. James Garner and Vera Miles are brilliant as always. There are some hair-raising moments which add to the action, as well as humorous and heart touching ones.I saw this on DVD, and would have liked to have seen an interview with the actors, especially what it was like to have worked with the animals involved.
