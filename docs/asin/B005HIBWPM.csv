1461053,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B005HIBWPM,mk,"[0, 0]","You've got to be kidding!  LOts of great reviews, but this is a campy 70's(and I grew up in the 70's) Western that really tries not to be campy, but it only makes it worse.  Wonderful outdoor shots and horsemanship but slammed with poor acting, script and, I think, the main culprit, poor directing.First, I don't think of this as a remake of 'The Searchers' with John Wayne, now replaced by Ben Johnson's character, whose daughter, Lana Wood is taken by Grayeagle.  There is a search for the woman, but the reasons are different.  The director tries to portray Native Americans in a good light. The opening with the teepees is very surreal, beautiful and promising; however, the music kicks in(most of it typical 70's over the top stuff) and the actors, especially, Wood and Alex Cord(a super horseman along with Ben Johnson) show up and terribly overact.It offers some very good, hardy actors in Johnson, Jack Elam(giving us, thankfully, humor with that squinty eye) and I like Iron Eyes Cody.  But I blame the director and the scriptwriter for not doing there jobs in making this into what could have been an amazing classic.  As it is, there are interesting parts and horrible, groaning parts.  Why they have Alex Cord talk in the low, droopy mouth, stilted speech is beyond me.  He's an handsome man and a super rider.  Lana Wood, sister of Natalie Wood. is beautiful but screechy, overly expressive and painfully misdirected.  She's more subdued near the end and more relaxed in her acting.Of note, they use a  lot of different character types to portray Native Americans.  I like Iron Eyes Cody, but he's of Italian descent.  He married an American Indian, supported their causes, and, of course, did that famous ad, against spoiling our enviroment, with the teardrop.Overall, they put a lot of effort in this movie with outdoor shots, horses, bizarre action scenes, but as a whole, I recommend, if you're going to watch this, turn off the sound.",2,Beautiful and Painful to Watch,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",2014,1953,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'LOts', 'great', 'reviews', 'campy', '70', 'grew', 'up', '70', 'Western', 'really', 'not', 'be', 'campy', 'only', 'worse', 'Wonderful', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'horsemanship', 'slammed', 'poor', 'acting', 'script', 'think', 'main', 'culprit', 'poor', 'directing.First', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'remake', ""'The"", 'Searchers', 'John', 'Wayne', 'now', 'replaced', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'character', 'daughter', 'Lana', 'Wood', 'taken', 'Grayeagle', 'search', 'woman', 'reasons', 'are', 'different', 'director', 'portray', 'Native', 'Americans', 'good', 'light', 'opening', 'teepees', 'very', 'surreal', 'beautiful', 'promising', 'however', 'music', 'most', 'typical', '70', 'top', 'stuff', 'actors', 'especially', 'Wood', 'Alex', 'Cord', 'super', 'horseman', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'show', 'up', 'terribly', 'overact.It', 'very', 'good', 'hardy', 'actors', 'Johnson', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'giving', 'thankfully', 'humor', 'squinty', 'eye', 'like', 'Iron', 'Eyes', 'Cody', 'blame', 'director', 'scriptwriter', 'not', 'doing', 'there', 'jobs', 'making', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'classic', 'are', 'interesting', 'parts', 'horrible', 'groaning', 'parts', 'Why', 'have', 'Alex', 'Cord', 'talk', 'low', 'droopy', 'mouth', 'stilted', 'speech', 'handsome', 'man', 'super', 'rider', 'Lana', 'Wood', 'sister', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'beautiful', 'screechy', 'overly', 'expressive', 'painfully', 'misdirected', 'more', 'subdued', 'end', 'more', 'relaxed', 'acting.Of', 'note', 'use', 'lot', 'different', 'character', 'types', 'portray', 'Native', 'Americans', 'like', 'Iron', 'Eyes', 'Cody', 'Italian', 'descent', 'married', 'American', 'Indian', 'supported', 'causes', 'course', 'did', 'famous', 'ad', 'spoiling', 'enviroment', 'teardrop.Overall', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'movie', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'horses', 'bizarre', 'action', 'scenes', 'whole', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'turn', 'off', 'sound']",Greyeagle
