The remaining campers go running around looking for friends and finding dead bodies then go running around some more.So the plot is not at all original.  Yet, the script is truely sad.  Why would a camper stand there and apologizing repeatedly to his friend who was just stabbed with a tree limb? I do understand in a horror movie some suspended disbelief is a given...but at the same time a little bit of common since is nice. Also, the acting is horrible.  The actors seemed to either be bored or overact.  The sound effects were cheesey and got annoying after awhile. How many ""boooing"" sounds can one person bear to hear when a killing is about to occur?  There is some gore but I wouldn't call it gory compared to today's movies.  Oh but I will say that when you finally do get to see the killer...he looks like some sort of Geico Caveman gone wrong.

After recently watching ""Don't go in the Woods...Alone!"" again, I realized I was confusing this movie with another under-the-radar 80's slasher called ""Just Before Dawn"". Where ""Dawn"" actually tries to frighten the viewer, ""Woods"" sets out to.....well I'm not really sure? While it is a slasher flick, and it does feature buckets of blood, I don't think they were really setting out scare people. You will be chuckling throughout the movie, you can't help it. The basic story of two couples on a weekend camping trip serves as just a backdrop while a furry mountain man seems to slash his way around a mountain full of girls on rollerskates, newlyweds, birdwatchers, and even a guy in a wheelchair??!! Seriously, at about every 5 minutes for the duration of the film we are introduced to some new character, only to watch them get sliced and diced. This movie has to have one of the biggest body counts of any 80's slasher film made.

948713,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000BRBAGU,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 2]","Well, I had heard a great deal about the notorious slasher, ""Don't Go In the Woods...Alone"", and not all of it was good.  Still, I love slashers in the woods as that is one of my favorite settings for a slasher movie.  Ostensibly, ""Don't Go In The Woods...Alone"" seemed like just what the doctor ordered.  Of course, having seen ""The Forest"", perhaps, I should have known better.Basically, ""Don't Go In the Woods...Alone"" starts about like any other slasher that takes place in the woods or forest.  A small group of campers decide to go camping in some thick woods, and people start dying at the hands of some kind of killer, slasher style.At first, I was thinking that maybe this movie would not be so bad as it starts out with a pretty good score/soundtrack, and the movie starts out with a rather bloody and somewhat gorey kill even if it was not that convincing.  Alas, things would begin to go south early on as soon as someone opened their mouth.  Indeed, make no mistake about it as the acting was atrocious even for this type of flick.  Second, while the blood and gore was gratuitous, it was not realistically done, and it did look quite fake.  Moreover, the movie itself had for a lack of a better word, a rather hokie feel to it with uneven scenes that seemed to attempt to mix horror with comedy.  The result was pretty much a complete mess by movie's end.The uneven scene transition made for a rather awkward movie overall, and there was no denying the ""cheese"" associated with this movie.  Perhaps, the most glaring problem with ""Dont Go In the Woods...Alone"" is the absolutely ridiculous looking villain in this movie.  Just based on the looks of the villain alone, this movie comes off as a complete joke.  The villain is absolutely pathetic-looking and laughable in every conceivable way.  Sadly, I have seen much worse.  Just watch ""The Forest"" and see what I mean.I really wanted to like ""Don't Go in the Woods...Alone"", and for a few minutes, I thought I would when the killer was mysteriously kept under wraps for the first few death scenes, and the score was pretty good, but, alas, it just is not a serious horror movie at all.  In all fairness, ""Don't Go In the Woods...Alone"" was meant to be and is a complete and total utter joke, and that's just not my cup of tea.  One STAR for the forest setting, the surprisingly decent score (I've heard a lot of people didn't like it), early mystery of the killer that was eventually ruined and made into a joke, and the death scenes (as unconvincing and fake as they were), but that's about it, folks, and that is no where near enough to make a good horror movie.  However, if you are the kind of person that likes horror-comedies, you may want to check this out or if you are the kind of person that likes the ""so bad of a movie that it's good"", this might be for you too.  However, I do not like either one of those styled movies.  If you are like me, watch ""Just Before Dawn"" instead for an eerie and altogether different slasher in the woods experience.",1,"""Sometimes, it makes you kinda wonder."" -The Sheriff",1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3024,"['Well', 'had', 'heard', 'great', 'deal', 'notorious', 'slasher', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Woods', 'Alone', 'not', 'was', 'good', 'Still', 'love', 'slashers', 'woods', 'one', 'favorite', 'settings', 'slasher', 'movie', 'Ostensibly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Woods', 'Alone', 'seemed', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered', 'course', 'having', 'seen', 'Forest', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better.Basically', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Woods', 'Alone', 'other', 'slasher', 'place', 'woods', 'forest', 'small', 'group', 'campers', 'decide', 'go', 'camping', 'thick', 'woods', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'hands', 'kind', 'killer', 'slasher', 'style.At', 'first', 'was', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'score/soundtrack', 'movie', 'out', 'rather', 'bloody', 'somewhat', 'gorey', 'kill', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'convincing', 'Alas', 'things', 'would', 'begin', 'go', 'south', 'early', 'as', 'soon', 'someone', 'opened', 'mouth', 'Indeed', 'make', 'mistake', 'about', 'acting', 'was', 'atrocious', 'even', 'type', 'flick', 'Second', 'blood', 'gore', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'was', 'not', 'realistically', 'done', 'did', 'look', 'quite', 'fake', 'Moreover', 'movie', 'had', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'rather', 'hokie', 'feel', 'uneven', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'attempt', 'mix', 'horror', 'comedy', 'result', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'complete', 'mess', 'movie', 'end.The', 'uneven', 'scene', 'transition', 'made', 'rather', 'awkward', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'denying', 'cheese', 'associated', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'glaring', 'problem', 'Dont', 'Go', 'Woods', 'Alone', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'looking', 'villain', 'movie', 'Just', 'based', 'looks', 'villain', 'alone', 'movie', 'off', 'complete', 'joke', 'villain', 'absolutely', 'pathetic-looking', 'laughable', 'conceivable', 'way', 'Sadly', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'worse', 'Just', 'watch', 'Forest', 'see', 'what', 'mean.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Woods', 'Alone', 'few', 'minutes', 'thought', 'would', 'when', 'killer', 'was', 'mysteriously', 'kept', 'wraps', 'first', 'few', 'death', 'scenes', 'score', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'alas', 'just', 'not', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'fairness', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Woods', 'Alone', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'complete', 'total', 'utter', 'joke', 'just', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'One', 'STAR', 'forest', 'setting', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'score', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'early', 'mystery', 'killer', 'was', 'eventually', 'ruined', 'made', 'joke', 'death', 'scenes', 'unconvincing', 'fake', 'were', 'folks', 'where', 'near', 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'However', 'are', 'kind', 'person', 'horror-comedies', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'kind', 'person', 'so', 'bad', 'movie', 'good', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'one', 'styled', 'movies', 'are', 'watch', 'Just', 'Dawn', 'instead', 'eerie', 'altogether', 'different', 'slasher', 'woods', 'experience']",N/A

I have not a clue how they made some of those sounds and, sometimes the music plays at odd times when nothing is really happening.
