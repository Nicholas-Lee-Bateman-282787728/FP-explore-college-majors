Forget about those dowdy 70's fashions----This is quality programming at its best!  From the days that scripts actually required &#34;sweat&#34; to be produced and executed. If you have not seen the FBI with Efrem Zimbalist before, or have just seen one or two episodes---Season 6 is a great season to jump back in.  My teenagers were glued to to the screen as they watched the first episode of this season.  Evidence that a quality production is timeless!  Good job Warner Archives!!

The quality is sound is much better but again, not totally cleaned up. Also I am glad that they put in one volume, and last they are better secured. There is no way to see what each show about and what guest stars in that show. They on them on the cover but there is no way of knowing until you start watching the whole show. Considering the price we paying for this season. Look forward to season 7, if it's not already.

1673416,A2ZELOPYDRS6VU,B00FUABJMS,Love Our Military Men,"[17, 17]","I have been ordering THE FBI since it was first released in the 'split' volumes and although it has taken five seasons of releases - I am thrilled that Warner is now releasing the well scripted, well acted series in 'whole' seasons! This is the '70/'71 season and finds Efrem Zimbalist and Philip Abbott taking on the bad guys, investigating and having them arrested in their professional roles with the agency - and all cases are based on real life incidences from government case files. We've only got three more seasons to go to complete our collections. (Item of interest: In an interview many years ago, Efrem presumably did not want continue the series about two thirds of the way through because of other pending interests, but his close friend Quinn Martin, who was also the producer of the show begged Efrem to go on for a few more seasons because that would take him to his (Martin's) retirement. Efrem conceded - and I'm sure glad he did - what a gentleman!) The episodes have been great on all previous releases -and this season is no exception and the series is really in it's stride here.There are many notable guest stars in this SIXTH SEASON 26 episode issuance and it's fun to see many of these (now) well known stars when they were so very young! They include:Tim McIntire, Joan Van Ark, Martin Sheen, Bradford Dillman, Wayne Rogers, Antoinette Bower, Paul Bryar, Harry Guardino, Billy Dee Williams, Monte Markham, Darleen Carr, David Macklin, Ellen Corby, Geoffrey Deuel, Tom Falk, Louis Nettleton, Robert Loggia, Hari Rhodes, Mariette Hartley, Eric Braeden, John Kerr, Roger Perry, Don Grady, Dabney Coleman, Gary Collins, Vic Morrow, Diane Keaton, Michael Douglas, Donna Mills, Peter Mark Richmond, Susan O'Connell, Suzanne Pleshette and many more!Picture quality is very good and consistent with previous releases.
