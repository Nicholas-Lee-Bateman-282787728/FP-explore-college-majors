That may not be a true statement anymore, since I just watched the first 7 seasons of Criminal Minds. People said the show was good, but that doesn't begin to cover the magnitude of what they've pulled off with this show.I'll admit that I wasn't a huge Rossi fan when he got on board, but after season 4, I hardly remembered much about season 1 and 2. To me, that's a good thing. It means that the show is getting better. Personally, I loved the story arc with Emily Prentiss in season 6, and I also love the end of that story arc in season 7. I also enjoy the fact that they chose to end both season 6 and 7 on notes that were either neutral or high.I suppose the show could be considered a police procedural type show, but it's so much more too. It's got fantastic writing, depth of characters - great cast to portray interesting characters, and cool special effects. Most of the special effects featurettes focus on them blowing up something or other.It's always sad to lose major characters from any show, but I think they handled it well. I also enjoy the fact that you can watch random episodes and be entertained or watch them in order and get drawn into the overarching stories they're telling.A great buy for all who like action in their drama.",5,Fastastic Show that Keeps Getting Better,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,1303,"['***Spoilers', 'Possible***I', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'TV', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'statement', 'anymore', 'just', 'watched', 'first', '7', 'seasons', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'People', 'said', 'show', 'was', 'good', ""n't"", 'begin', 'cover', 'magnitude', 'what', ""'ve"", 'pulled', 'off', 'show.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'Rossi', 'fan', 'when', 'got', 'board', 'season', '4', 'hardly', 'remembered', 'much', 'season', '1', '2', 'good', 'thing', 'show', 'getting', 'better', 'Personally', 'loved', 'story', 'arc', 'Emily', 'Prentiss', 'season', '6', 'also', 'love', 'end', 'story', 'arc', 'season', '7', 'also', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'chose', 'end', 'season', '6', '7', 'notes', 'were', 'neutral', 'high.I', 'suppose', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'police', 'procedural', 'type', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'too', 'got', 'fantastic', 'writing', 'depth', 'characters', 'great', 'cast', 'portray', 'interesting', 'characters', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'Most', 'special', 'effects', 'focus', 'blowing', 'up', 'something', 'other.It', 'always', 'sad', 'lose', 'major', 'characters', 'show', 'think', 'handled', 'well', 'also', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'can', 'watch', 'random', 'episodes', 'be', 'entertained', 'watch', 'order', 'get', 'drawn', 'overarching', 'stories', ""'re"", 'telling.A', 'great', 'buy', 'who', 'action', 'drama']",Criminal Minds: Seasons 1-7

1549334,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B008AYH3AI,Octavius,"[2, 10]","Criminal Minds is an above average crime show following a team of FBI profilers who help other law enforcement agencies track down serial killers.  Although solid in most of its characters and imaginative in most of its plots, the series nevertheless falls victim to its own modus operandi of cheap humor and superficial characters.The series has always kept a good cast for the most part: in particular with Thomas Gibson as Aaron Hotchner, Joe Montegna as David Rossi, and Shemar Moore as Special Agent Derek Morgan. Paget Brewster as Special Agent Emily Prentiss and A.J. Cook as Special Agent JJ Jareau also provide strong and credible female characters. Matthew Gray Gubler as Dr. Spencer Reid and Kirsten Vangsness as Penelope Garcia are the weakest links in the series which could have done much better without them.  Although Gubler's character seems to have some of the qualities required for an FBI special agent(Type A personality), his overly effeminate physique and introverted intellectual traits make it unlikely that he would ever see something other than a desk.  To see him running around chasing serial killers with his gun drawn seems hard to believe.The character of Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) is the worst part of the series.  The character's emotional tantrums (not to mention her complete vulgarity in tastes) are simply obnoxious.  Listening to her talk to Morgan and others with her stupid 'sweetie pie' remarks makes her come across as an unprofessional emotional wreck who undermines the dramatic qualities of the show.  A grotesque incarnation of Ms. Piggy from 'The Muppet Show', she smothers the rest of the cast at odd intervals with her over-the-top tantrums.  Unlike the comparable Abbie in NCIS which is more of an action-comedy series with light drama suited for this kind of character, Criminal Minds' mainly dramatic theme involving sadistic sociopaths requires more credible characters with less light humor.  One shouldn't have to expect the sudden appearance of Kermit and the rest of the muppet gang to ease the tension in this kind of show.  Cynical sarcasm such as the one used by the characters in the Law & Order series would have worked better for this show.The plot lines and the development of the antagonists in most of the episodes are pretty good although there are a few far-fetched ones.  Some of the episodes involve either unlikely profiles such as two teens wanting to recreate a video-game or the plots are too complex to really make them fit in a one-hour format.  Still, most of the episodes are well written and more credible than the over-the-top scenarios commonly found in the CSI or Bones series.",3,Good Crime Drama Poorly Lightened with Bad Character Choices,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,2661,"['Criminal', 'Minds', 'above', 'average', 'crime', 'show', 'following', 'team', 'FBI', 'profilers', 'who', 'help', 'other', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agencies', 'track', 'down', 'serial', 'killers', 'solid', 'most', 'characters', 'imaginative', 'most', 'plots', 'series', 'nevertheless', 'victim', 'own', 'modus', 'operandi', 'cheap', 'humor', 'superficial', 'characters.The', 'series', 'always', 'kept', 'good', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'particular', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'Aaron', 'Hotchner', 'Joe', 'Montegna', 'David', 'Rossi', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Derek', 'Morgan', 'Paget', 'Brewster', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Emily', 'Prentiss', 'A.J', 'Cook', 'Special', 'Agent', 'JJ', 'Jareau', 'also', 'provide', 'strong', 'credible', 'female', 'characters', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'Dr.', 'Spencer', 'Reid', 'Kirsten', 'Vangsness', 'Penelope', 'Garcia', 'are', 'weakest', 'links', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Gubler', 'character', 'have', 'qualities', 'required', 'FBI', 'special', 'agent', 'Type', 'A', 'personality', 'overly', 'effeminate', 'physique', 'introverted', 'intellectual', 'traits', 'make', 'unlikely', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'something', 'other', 'desk', 'see', 'running', 'around', 'chasing', 'serial', 'killers', 'gun', 'drawn', 'hard', 'believe.The', 'character', 'Garcia', 'Kirsten', 'Vangsness', 'worst', 'part', 'series', 'character', 'emotional', 'tantrums', 'not', 'mention', 'complete', 'vulgarity', 'tastes', 'are', 'simply', 'obnoxious', 'Listening', 'talk', 'Morgan', 'others', 'stupid', ""'sweetie"", 'pie', 'remarks', 'come', 'unprofessional', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'who', 'dramatic', 'qualities', 'show', 'grotesque', 'incarnation', 'Ms.', 'Piggy', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'rest', 'cast', 'odd', 'intervals', 'over-the-top', 'tantrums', 'comparable', 'Abbie', 'NCIS', 'more', 'action-comedy', 'series', 'light', 'drama', 'suited', 'kind', 'character', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'mainly', 'dramatic', 'theme', 'involving', 'sadistic', 'sociopaths', 'more', 'credible', 'characters', 'less', 'light', 'humor', 'One', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'expect', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'Kermit', 'rest', 'muppet', 'gang', 'ease', 'tension', 'kind', 'show', 'Cynical', 'sarcasm', 'such', 'one', 'used', 'characters', 'Law', 'Order', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'show.The', 'plot', 'lines', 'development', 'antagonists', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'far-fetched', 'ones', 'episodes', 'involve', 'unlikely', 'profiles', 'such', 'two', 'teens', 'wanting', 'recreate', 'video-game', 'plots', 'are', 'too', 'complex', 'really', 'make', 'fit', 'one-hour', 'format', 'Still', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'more', 'credible', 'over-the-top', 'scenarios', 'commonly', 'found', 'CSI', 'Bones', 'series']",Criminal Minds: Seasons 1-7
