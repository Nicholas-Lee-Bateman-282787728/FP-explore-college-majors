1287772,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B002T5QM42,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[4, 5]","""Creation"" tells the story of the ""creation"" of one of the greatest intellectual achievements in human history -- Charles Darwin's ""On the Origins of Species."" As depicted here in a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, the great scientist brilliantly played by Paul Bettany, is haunted by the early death of his beloved eldest daughter Annie. It has driven him away from his devoutly Christian wife, Emma, (played by his real-life wife Jennifer Connelly) who both blames herself and her husband for the child's death -- and yet is comforted by the thought of her safe in Heaven.Darwin himself has lost his religious faith, yet he hesitates to publish his great work for fear of destroying not only his marriage but of dismantling one of the pillars of English society. And yet, how can he hide the truth as he clearly perceives it? The conflict is eating him up from within -- bent, sick, feeble, his hands shaking, he lacks the strength and determination necessary to fulfill the role history has allotted him. He sees the ghost of his daughter at every turn, reproaching him for being untrue to himself.This movie is well-acted and well-written and very moving. One can sympathize with all the characters. All are flawed, trying to do the best as they see it. But it's Darwin on whom the focus must remain. He sees the world differently from others. His keen observation of life around him informs his genius.When one considers that here today in the United States, the theory of evolution is still disputed by religious fundamentalists who make a religion of ignorance, one can understand his hesitation to publish. And yet, as he states in his great work, their is grandeur in his picture of the world -- and endlessly complex mechanism that produced one a mind such as his.",5,Moving story of Darwin's inner turmoil,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,1781,"['Creation', 'story', 'creation', 'one', 'greatest', 'intellectual', 'achievements', 'human', 'history', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'Origins', 'Species', 'depicted', 'here', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'flashforwards', 'great', 'scientist', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'haunted', 'early', 'death', 'beloved', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Annie', 'driven', 'away', 'devoutly', 'Christian', 'wife', 'Emma', 'played', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'who', 'husband', 'child', 'death', 'yet', 'comforted', 'thought', 'safe', 'Heaven.Darwin', 'lost', 'religious', 'faith', 'yet', 'publish', 'great', 'work', 'fear', 'destroying', 'not', 'only', 'marriage', 'dismantling', 'one', 'pillars', 'English', 'society', 'yet', 'how', 'can', 'hide', 'truth', 'clearly', 'conflict', 'eating', 'up', 'bent', 'sick', 'feeble', 'hands', 'shaking', 'strength', 'determination', 'necessary', 'fulfill', 'role', 'history', 'allotted', 'ghost', 'daughter', 'turn', 'reproaching', 'being', 'untrue', 'himself.This', 'movie', 'well-acted', 'well-written', 'very', 'moving', 'One', 'can', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'see', 'Darwin', 'whom', 'focus', 'must', 'remain', 'world', 'differently', 'others', 'keen', 'observation', 'life', 'informs', 'genius.When', 'one', 'here', 'today', 'United', 'States', 'theory', 'evolution', 'still', 'disputed', 'religious', 'fundamentalists', 'who', 'make', 'religion', 'ignorance', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'hesitation', 'publish', 'yet', 'great', 'work', 'grandeur', 'picture', 'world', 'endlessly', 'complex', 'mechanism', 'produced', 'one', 'mind', 'such']",Creation anglais

That, in what I know of him, is not true.  If you read his book, ""On the Origin of Species"" (which I have read 3-4 times) you can feel his thoughts and beliefs come through.  Ok, read just the last sentence, and that will be enough.I have the strong impression that his falling out with the Church of England is not due to his lack of personal faith, but, rather, because the Church provided an unyielding stone wall that was dogmatically unwilling to consider the possibility of anything other than the strict literalist reading of the creation of the world as found in Genesis, while Darwin's 20+ years of observation showed him that species can and do change, appear, and go extinct.Kudos to Darwin for his willingness to share the truths he discovered, and to his wife, Emma, too.

For one thing, Darwin married his first cousin, so at some point the question arises as to whether that was the reason that his oldest daughter, his favorite daughter Annie, was too weak to throw off what was probably pneumonia. But the fault might as easily have been the rather primitive medical care she received.Darwin was so devastated by her death that he became ill. Or perhaps the fault there was a tropical disease he picked up on his voyage. As I say, medicine was pretty primitive. Ironically, Darwin's discoveries have had a profound effect on the science of medicine.Another problem was that his wife was a devout Christian, and saw clearly that his theories had no room for a creator god in them. At the very least, they contradicted the Book of Genesis most emphatically.So many things held him back from writing his book that it took a 20-page letter from another scientist who had come up with very much the same theory, plus a visit from his friend Hooker who insisted that he had so much more detail and evidence to present that he should go ahead and do it before the other guy. (Historians remember his name; it may have been Watson. Something veddy, veddy English.)This is a very effective telling of a story many others have told. It manages to take a different angle, and a different story telling method, relying heavily on interpreting the mind of Darwin into dreams and perhaps hallucinations. Since there are also just plain memories and the time line jumps around a lot, it mirrors the confusion Darwin himself felt as he dealt with all the factors he knew were involved in the publication of his work. An important aspect remained his love for his wife and her devoutly religious beliefs.",5,A Critical Period in Charles Darwin's Life,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1934,"['BBC', 'film', 'documenting', 'critical', 'period', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'life', 'basically', 'time', 'returned', 'voyage', 'Beagle', 'publication', 'Origin', 'Species.You', 'know', 'basic', 'facts', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'thing', 'Darwin', 'married', 'first', 'cousin', 'so', 'point', 'question', 'was', 'reason', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'Annie', 'was', 'too', 'weak', 'throw', 'off', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'pneumonia', 'fault', 'might', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'primitive', 'medical', 'care', 'received.Darwin', 'was', 'so', 'devastated', 'death', 'became', 'ill.', 'Or', 'perhaps', 'fault', 'was', 'tropical', 'disease', 'picked', 'up', 'voyage', 'say', 'medicine', 'was', 'pretty', 'primitive', 'Ironically', 'Darwin', 'discoveries', 'have', 'had', 'profound', 'effect', 'science', 'medicine.Another', 'problem', 'was', 'wife', 'was', 'devout', 'Christian', 'saw', 'clearly', 'theories', 'had', 'room', 'creator', 'god', 'very', 'least', 'contradicted', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'most', 'emphatically.So', 'many', 'things', 'held', 'back', 'writing', 'book', 'took', '20-page', 'letter', 'scientist', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'theory', 'visit', 'friend', 'Hooker', 'who', 'insisted', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'evidence', 'present', 'should', 'go', 'ahead', 'do', 'other', 'guy', 'Historians', 'remember', 'name', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Watson', 'Something', 'veddy', 'veddy', 'English', 'very', 'effective', 'telling', 'story', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'told', 'take', 'different', 'angle', 'different', 'story', 'telling', 'method', 'relying', 'heavily', 'interpreting', 'mind', 'Darwin', 'dreams', 'perhaps', 'hallucinations', 'are', 'also', 'just', 'plain', 'memories', 'time', 'line', 'jumps', 'lot', 'confusion', 'Darwin', 'felt', 'factors', 'knew', 'were', 'involved', 'publication', 'work', 'important', 'aspect', 'remained', 'love', 'wife', 'devoutly', 'religious', 'beliefs']",Creation anglais

If only the plot lived up to the on-screen scenery, it'd be a fine production indeed! Instead, Creation re-casts Charles Darwin as a madman, Emma Darwin as a shrew, and poor Annie Darwin as a revenant (if only in her father's tormented mind). It also seeks to add drama to an event in human history (the release of Darwin's theories on natural selection) already so remarkable in itself that it requires no gilded reinterpretation.While Darwin look-alike Paul Bettany was truly excellent in his interpretation of the great naturalist, poor Jennifer Connelly was left to struggle to make something out of the filmmakers' terrible perspective on Emma, who was by any account I've ever seen nothing like Creation would have us believe. (Connelly also looked almost nothing like Emma, and never came across as convincingly Victorian in dress, manner, hairstyle or tone.)Creation was bad enough to merit two stars for plot but the visual satisfaction it provides does go some way toward carrying its multitudinous defects. For a more informative take on Charles Darwin's life and mindset in the period before the release of The Origin of Species, or on the Darwin family itself, look to the many other biographies in both print and film that tell the story more accurately than the failed melodrama that was Creation. I'd recommend Darwin's Darkest Hour, and Charles and Emma as being two excellent places to start, though why not simply explore Darwin's books for yourself? They combine readability with a vast sense of intellectual stimulation that no analysis can hope to match.

The theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the most controversial ideas that any human has ever come up with. Shouldn't the film about the man responsible for this idea have some intensity and passion, perhaps stirring up some debate of it's own? Apparently that was not the intention of the filmmakers. They made a film as genteel as could possibly be made. It's even strangely disrespectful of Darwin himself, portrraying him as a raving loon at times, possibly a schizophrenic. This is really off the mark. Of course the man was deeply distressed by the death of his daughter but the movie has him running around like a crazy man, talking to her ghost.The focus is too much on Darwin's family dynamic, ( something we see all too often in biographical films of great historical figures ), and not enough on what made Darwin the legendary scientist that he was. The filmmakers take the unfortunate path of trying to have the audience relate to Darwin in the most cozy and sentimental way. The more honest road would have been to make a film about his passionate exploration of the natural world and how he came to the understanding of his theory. There is little shown here about Darwin's enthusiasm and commitment. The film mostly focuses on his endless suffering. The daughter is too prevalent in the story. One wonders if she's the main character.The performances are respectable. Bettany played a similar scientist in ""Master and Commander"" opposite Russell Crowe. That movie was a sea-faring action adventure but Bettany's characterization of a naturalist was far better than his dreay role here in ""Creation"". Jennifer Connelly has played suffering women for so long that adding another role like this under her belt doesn't distinguish it at all from her previous work.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[7, 8]","This rather dry prune of a film is not all bad--it shows a young Darwin struggling as a scientist who has lost a child (Annie, his eldest) and his faith in God. No wonder. Based on the novel ""Annie's Box"" by Randal Keynes (presumably Darwin kept his notes locked in a chest which for whatever reason becomes known as ""Annie's Box""), this film tries too hard to be film-as-literature. Always a bad idea in my humble opinion.This film is saddening in more ways than one. While it is a brilliant study of a young mid-19th century couple and their travails with all their kids--plus coping with the death of a favored child--it is no truly brilliant study of Darwin. Some reviews say something like ""It goes to the heart of Darwin."" I didn't get that here. This film missed much deeper metaphysical probing, was slow and unnecessarily sagging at times.The flashback-and-forth storytelling method may work for novels; in film, unless masterfully done, it' terrible. Here, it's terrible. I got a headache with all that time-travel. Very disorderly. At an hour and forty minutes, this film should have been more Darwin at work and less grief over the lost child. There was something here...the imaginary daughter with Darwin all the time as he hid from his family reminded me of his role as the imaginary boyfriend of Dr. John Nash in A BEAUTIFUL MIND.Ho-hum was my response to that.I do not ever discount the horror of the loss of a child--and I ought to know that pain well enough. CREATION tries too hard to have it both ways: to paint Darwin as a tortured but dedicated scientist and simultaneously have God win this ""battle"". As Darwin says, it isn't so much a battle as an argument in his own mind. This movie shows too little of that argument, in fact too little of any argument. Yet Darwin wins over his religious wife and publishes his ""Origin"".Where's the scientific-versus-theological beef?!This film began with a misleading tinge of adventure and humor...I wondered if I'd see anything of Darwin sailing on the Beagle, or anything at all of interest to a scientist/biography nut. There is too little of it. This movie is a great deal like watching those documentaries that profess to be about Einstein, then show you nothing but light waves and melting clocks, or else prattling on about his fights with his first wife.Well, I say it's worth a look; it definitely is not the finest of British period pieces, biopics or anything, but at least it was a good, honest try.

The acting is fine and Paul Bettany pulls off a decent Darwin. There are some great scenes, particularly the Orangutan, the death of Darwin's daughter, and Huxley's cameo. I really liked the way it portrayed the ""survival of the fittest"" - not as an academic debate, but as a series of field observations in the outdoors - exactly where Darwin would have devised his theory.Unfortunately,Creation's approach to Charles Darwin's character is horrible. The Charles Darwin inCreationcomes across as more a delusional hypochondriac than one of the most brilliant, important men ever to have lived. It's one thing to avoid lionizing the man, but it's just as inappropriate to wrongly portray him as schizoid. There was plenty in Darwin's life that would have made compelling drama - the death of his daughter was a crucial moment - without going over into hyperbole. Sadly, the only conclusion I can draw is that the producers, directors, and scriptwriters behindCreationthought modern viewers were too unsophisticated and impatient to actually watch a realistic drama about Darwin.I'd recommendDarwin's Darkest Houras an alternative toCreation.Creationhas its moments, but don't confuse it for a documentary about Charles Darwin.",3,Delusional Darwin,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,1339,"['When', 'heard', 'aboutCreation', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'try', 'capture', 'Darwin', 'man', 'modern', 'film', 'audiences', 'acting', 'fine', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'decent', 'Darwin', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'Orangutan', 'death', 'Darwin', 'daughter', 'Huxley', 'cameo', 'really', 'liked', 'way', 'portrayed', 'survival', 'fittest', 'not', 'academic', 'debate', 'series', 'field', 'observations', 'outdoors', 'exactly', 'where', 'Darwin', 'would', 'have', 'devised', 'theory.Unfortunately', 'Creation', 'approach', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'character', 'horrible', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'inCreationcomes', 'more', 'delusional', 'hypochondriac', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'important', 'men', 'ever', 'have', 'lived', 'one', 'thing', 'avoid', 'lionizing', 'man', 'just', 'as', 'inappropriate', 'wrongly', 'portray', 'schizoid', 'was', 'plenty', 'Darwin', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'compelling', 'drama', 'death', 'daughter', 'was', 'crucial', 'moment', 'going', 'hyperbole', 'Sadly', 'only', 'conclusion', 'can', 'draw', 'producers', 'directors', 'scriptwriters', 'behindCreationthought', 'modern', 'viewers', 'were', 'too', 'unsophisticated', 'impatient', 'actually', 'watch', 'realistic', 'drama', 'Darwin.I', ""'d"", 'recommendDarwin', 'Darkest', 'Houras', 'alternative', 'toCreation.Creationhas', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'documentary', 'Charles', 'Darwin']",Creation anglais

Certainly, the focus upon Darwin's private life - as a husband and a father - is an interesting way to portray the man.  Yet, Toby Jones' electrifying portrayal of Thomas Henry Huxley - even though brief - had more moment in the drama than anything the actor did as Darwin.  What I did not like about the film is that it made the tremendous genius look like a hallucinating madman in the same way that Vincent Van Gogh is often described as a mentally disturbed artist rather than show these men as the thoughtful intellectuals both of them truly were.  It is true that Darwin was emotionally wounded by the deaths of his daughters and that he did worry about the effect of his great idea on contemporary Christian understanding as well as his wife's profound religious views. But actually his wife was far more supportive of his enterprise than is shown in the film...and Charles Darwin's sudden rush to publish the ""Big Book"" after 1858 was probably spurred by the fear that another scientist would take the credit for the insights he had developed for decades. In summary, see ""Darwin's Darkest Hour"" for a far more balanced view of the critical year before publication of ""On the Origin of Species."" Alternatively, there is a very, very good ""biography"" of Darwin on DVD entitled ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" which is the opening movie in the 7 part ""Evolution"" series from PBS.But I will say that the scenes of Darwin interacting with a zoo Orangutan are magical.

1287785,A1B79U197FOH05,B002T5QM42,"G. M. Casey ""gcasem""","[7, 21]","While there are warm scenes between Darwin and his daughter Anne and also, of course, between Darwin and his wife, the movie as a whole has a somber tenor about it.  The tone of the film is necessarily sad because of the argument being made that the existence of evil argues against God's existence, certainly an age-old argument.  To make the point there is a lot of suffering shown:  by Darwin, his daughter, and by certain creatures that are highlighted.  In making this argument the film-makers do not take into consideration how the fall of man that we read about in Genesis brought death upon all of creation.Darwin as played by Paul Bettany suffers greatly from physical and emotional illness (just as Darwin did) and he is mentally tormented by what he sees as purposeless in nature and the needless destruction of animal life: in the film Darwin mentions the trout, for example, producing myriads of offspring which are then eaten by other animals.There is some historical inaccuracy that I was able to detect.  The major impetus for Darwin writing his seminal book was not so much Huxley, but Darwin's receiving a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace who also conceived the theory of evolution.  Wallace, a spiritist, had received the theory in a vision.  Darwin's colleagues such as Thomas Huxley urged Darwin to write his book so that he would be given sole credit for the theory.  The film makes the reason for the writing of the Origin of Species a moral argument coming from Huxley and agreed upon by Darwin when really it was  the threat from Wallace that was the reason.Christianity is rather misrepresented by the local village pastor who is cruel and unreasonable to Anne and in the end abandons Darwin.  This is an unfortunate representation of Christianity but it helps the argument of the film.  During Darwin's lifetime there were very sincere and Godly Christians who were providing housing, food, and clothing in Bristol and in London.  Thousands of orphans were helped.  This was only a small part of what was happening in Christianity.  It is also true that there were men taking positions as country vicars who cared more for a respectable position and  their hobbies than the souls of men,  but, as I say, there was much more to the picture than what they represented.Also, Darwin's theory was not opposed only by the religious, a point made by Huxley in the movie.  It was also opposed by reputable scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Gregor Mendel to name a few.  Also, many who were religious, including many clergy,  jumped on the Darwinian bandwagon.  Darwin's theory was an excuse to disregard the Bible, or, at the least, not regard it as an authority.  This is the reason why in many religious circles today, the Bible is considered to be only myth or poetry.Many of us can relate, I am sure, to Darwin's struggle (at least to some extent) with the existence of evil and the seeming lack of purpose of things.  For many of us, when we came to know Jesus Christ, we looked at God's creation quite differently and could understand the purpose of things.  We could also appreciate the effect that the fall of man has had upon the creation.  But we can watch this film and realize that before we were Christians we similarly did not appreciate God for who He is and His creation for what it is.",2,Creation: An Argument Against the Existence of God,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,3346,"['are', 'warm', 'scenes', 'Darwin', 'daughter', 'Anne', 'also', 'course', 'Darwin', 'wife', 'movie', 'whole', 'somber', 'tenor', 'tone', 'film', 'necessarily', 'sad', 'argument', 'being', 'made', 'existence', 'evil', 'argues', 'God', 'existence', 'certainly', 'age-old', 'argument', 'make', 'point', 'lot', 'suffering', 'shown', 'Darwin', 'daughter', 'certain', 'creatures', 'are', 'highlighted', 'making', 'argument', 'film-makers', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'consideration', 'how', 'fall', 'man', 'read', 'Genesis', 'brought', 'death', 'creation.Darwin', 'played', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'physical', 'emotional', 'illness', 'just', 'Darwin', 'did', 'mentally', 'tormented', 'what', 'purposeless', 'nature', 'needless', 'destruction', 'animal', 'life', 'film', 'Darwin', 'trout', 'example', 'producing', 'myriads', 'offspring', 'are', 'then', 'eaten', 'other', 'historical', 'inaccuracy', 'was', 'able', 'detect', 'major', 'impetus', 'Darwin', 'writing', 'seminal', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Huxley', 'Darwin', 'receiving', 'letter', 'Alfred', 'Russell', 'Wallace', 'who', 'also', 'conceived', 'theory', 'evolution', 'Wallace', 'spiritist', 'had', 'received', 'theory', 'vision', 'Darwin', 'colleagues', 'such', 'Thomas', 'Huxley', 'urged', 'Darwin', 'write', 'book', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'sole', 'credit', 'theory', 'film', 'reason', 'writing', 'Origin', 'Species', 'moral', 'argument', 'coming', 'Huxley', 'agreed', 'Darwin', 'when', 'really', 'was', 'threat', 'Wallace', 'was', 'reason.Christianity', 'rather', 'misrepresented', 'local', 'village', 'pastor', 'who', 'cruel', 'unreasonable', 'Anne', 'end', 'abandons', 'Darwin', 'unfortunate', 'representation', 'Christianity', 'argument', 'film', 'Darwin', 'lifetime', 'were', 'very', 'sincere', 'Godly', 'Christians', 'who', 'were', 'providing', 'housing', 'food', 'clothing', 'Bristol', 'London', 'Thousands', 'orphans', 'were', 'helped', 'was', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Christianity', 'also', 'true', 'were', 'men', 'taking', 'positions', 'country', 'vicars', 'who', 'cared', 'more', 'respectable', 'position', 'hobbies', 'souls', 'men', 'say', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'picture', 'what', 'represented.Also', 'Darwin', 'theory', 'was', 'not', 'opposed', 'only', 'religious', 'point', 'made', 'Huxley', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'opposed', 'reputable', 'scientists', 'such', 'James', 'Clerk', 'Maxwell', 'Lord', 'Kelvin', 'Gregor', 'Mendel', 'name', 'few', 'Also', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'religious', 'including', 'many', 'clergy', 'jumped', 'Darwinian', 'bandwagon', 'Darwin', 'theory', 'was', 'excuse', 'disregard', 'Bible', 'least', 'not', 'regard', 'authority', 'reason', 'why', 'many', 'religious', 'circles', 'today', 'Bible', 'considered', 'be', 'only', 'myth', 'poetry.Many', 'can', 'relate', 'am', 'sure', 'Darwin', 'struggle', 'least', 'extent', 'existence', 'evil', 'seeming', 'lack', 'purpose', 'things', 'many', 'when', 'came', 'know', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'looked', 'God', 'creation', 'quite', 'differently', 'could', 'understand', 'purpose', 'things', 'could', 'also', 'appreciate', 'effect', 'fall', 'man', 'had', 'creation', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'realize', 'were', 'Christians', 'similarly', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'God', 'who', 'creation', 'what']",Creation anglais

What this little film presents instead is the midlife crisis (the film takes place in 1858-59 and Darwin was born in 1809, having completed his 1840 'Voyage of the Beagle' after the famous time he spent from 1831 -36 on the HMS Beagle as a naturalist gathering data) when Darwin had made his observations of nature and natural survival of the fittest and was struggling with writing of 'The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection', a book that would threaten to incise his relationship not only with Christian society but also with his fervently religious wife Emma.  It is a story of the tortured man coping with the dichotomy between science and religion, between a man obsessed with his scientific discoveries while longing to be a good father to the children he loved. Yes there is discussion of his scientific theories, made mostly in his stories he told his children, but the book on which it is based, Randal Keynes 'Annie's Box' (Keynes is the great great grandson of Darwin) - a book of diaries and quiet notes about the Darwin and his oldest daughter Annie whose death as a young girl nearly destroyed Darwin - is more concerned with opening the windows to the family life of the great scientist than expounding the scientific theory we all know so well.  John Collee's screenplay serves the film well as does the careful direction of Jon Amiel.Charles Darwin's presence  is illuminated by Paul Bettany's performance and the difficult role of his wife Emma is played with great sensitivity by Bettany's real wife Jennifer Connelly.  The pivotal role of Annie (Darwin's eldest daughter who seemed to have inherited all of the curiosity and imagination of Darwin) is portrayed by first time actress Martha West (daughter of actor Dominic West): it is Annie's death that alters the course of this story, that  event and the final reconciliation between Darwin and Emma after Emma actually reads the completed book (The Origin of Species).  The supporting cast is excellent: Jeremy Northam is the unforgiving cleric Reverend Innes, the other Darwin children are very natural in their acting - Freya Parks, Harrison Sansostri, Christopher Dunkin - and Toby Jones adds sparks as Thomas Huxley who declares that Darwin's theories prove that God is dead! The cinematography by Jess Hall is excellent - especially in the scenes involving man's first connection with the apes.  The musical score by Christopher Young rather blurs all the action into a Victorian mush, but the actors and director are able to make us forget that ill-conceived add-on. In all, the film is a family story - it just so happens that the family is that of a great man about whose personal life we know very little. Impressive work.

Personally, I find this film steered well clear of both and it's refreshing to see a film tackle such a heavy-weight premise without making it too much of a documentary.As someone who has been through the agony of losing faith (though thankfully not losing a child), I found Bettany's portrayal very convincing and I think the director must have had some personal experience of this issue, as his treatment of it isn't strident, but more sympathetic and the film ends with the curious message 'Charles Darwin was buried in Westminster Abbey with full Christian honours' (something that no self-respecting militant atheist would mention).And then there is the portrayal of his daughter & wife. Jennifer Connolly (playing 'Emma Darwin') comes across brilliantly as one of those very strict Catholic women (of whom I know a few) who are quick to label any doubts as being sin. I think her real life relationship with Paul Bettany also adds a real emotional depth that is lacking in so many films about relationships.Many mistake this for cheesiness, but really cliche often makes the genuine seem tawdry.Lastly, there is Anne Darwin who comes across perfectly as one of those gracious full-of-life children who are sadly taken at a young age. The bits where Darwin hallucinates her & sees her running down alley-ways may be a little bit reminicent of other films (likeGhost Ship), but her acting is convincing enough.In criticism, the film did have a rather confusing structure, where events happened (e.g. Anne dying) & then you are shown what happened leading up to it. It reminded me rather ofFamily Guy, where persistent annoying digressions get in the way of moving the plot along. Unlike with someFamily Guyepisodes though, the playing with the time-line isn't so annoying as to ruin the film.Overall then, I would recommend this to everyone. I swear I could even get my Christian mother to watch this & she would not be offended by it. That's not to say the idea is not revolutionary but, likeOn The Origin of Speciesitself, it puts it in an agreeable way and so changes the World by silence and not by violence.As for recommendations?

The depiction of Darwin here makes him seem more like a tortured soul, a Romantic poet, or creative genius, than like a meticulous scientist who was also troubled at home and concerned about the moral implications of his work.The filmmakers take quite a few liberties with the actual facts of the story, but the general line is accurate.  Darwin was a devoted father, and was devastated by the death of his daughter Annie at age 10.  He was himself quite sickly in later years of his life, and his wife did worry whether his theories would keep him out of heaven.  As the film portrays it, the emotional strain of his guilt and the tension between his wife made him into a tormented wreck, literally haunted by apparitions of his deceased daughter.  The struggle to compose the Origin of Species is turned here into a kind of gothic horror.  The irony, as it is presented here, is that a man haunted by ghosts and racked by guilt and resentment at a God who would take away his daughter, would create a document that has served for many to banish superstition and guilt from the rational view of the world.  Darwin did have doubts as to whether he should publish his manuscript during his lifetime - but to present the actual composition of the Origin of Species as the product of feverish nightmares, resentment, and guilt gives a false impression.  The book doesn't at all read that way - it is clear, vivid and often quite witty - and his wife Emma did not merely approve its publication with reluctance in the end, but helped him to make his ideas clearer and her editorial input helped him to craft its prose into one of the masterpieces of modern scientific literature.The film looks good, and some of the best moments manage to illustrate effectively Darwin's view of the world - in which natural features must be understood as the product of an ongoing struggle for survival.  It's entertaining, and Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly deliver compelling performances.  It's a bit too melodramatic, though, for my tastes.  There's no real drama of ideas here, no sense of the struggle of discovery - rather the theory of evolution is treated as already worked out and the only issue is whether Darwin has the emotional fortitude to publish his account, whether he can reconcile with his wife Emma and achieve closure in his anger with God over the death of his daughter.",3,"Darwin as a tortured soul - tormented by fear and the ghost of his deceased daughter, and unable to finish the Origin of Species",1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,2677,"['focus', 'flawed', 'still', 'fascinating', 'biopic', 'not', 'scientific', 'process', 'led', 'discovery', 'evolution', 'rather', 'Darwin', 'psychological', 'struggle', 'come', 'grips', 'death', 'daughter', 'reconcile', 'theories', 'beliefs', 'God-fearing', 'wife', 'Emma', 'depiction', 'Darwin', 'here', 'seem', 'more', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Romantic', 'poet', 'creative', 'genius', 'meticulous', 'scientist', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'troubled', 'home', 'concerned', 'moral', 'implications', 'work.The', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'quite', 'few', 'liberties', 'actual', 'facts', 'story', 'general', 'line', 'accurate', 'Darwin', 'was', 'devoted', 'father', 'was', 'devastated', 'death', 'daughter', 'Annie', 'age', '10', 'was', 'quite', 'sickly', 'later', 'years', 'life', 'wife', 'did', 'worry', 'theories', 'would', 'keep', 'heaven', 'film', 'emotional', 'strain', 'guilt', 'tension', 'wife', 'made', 'tormented', 'wreck', 'literally', 'haunted', 'apparitions', 'deceased', 'daughter', 'struggle', 'compose', 'Origin', 'Species', 'turned', 'here', 'kind', 'gothic', 'horror', 'irony', 'presented', 'here', 'man', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'racked', 'guilt', 'resentment', 'God', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'daughter', 'would', 'create', 'document', 'served', 'many', 'banish', 'superstition', 'guilt', 'rational', 'view', 'world', 'Darwin', 'did', 'have', 'doubts', 'should', 'publish', 'manuscript', 'lifetime', 'present', 'actual', 'composition', 'Origin', 'Species', 'product', 'feverish', 'nightmares', 'resentment', 'guilt', 'false', 'impression', 'book', ""n't"", 'read', 'way', 'clear', 'vivid', 'often', 'quite', 'witty', 'wife', 'Emma', 'did', 'not', 'merely', 'approve', 'publication', 'reluctance', 'end', 'helped', 'make', 'ideas', 'clearer', 'editorial', 'input', 'helped', 'craft', 'prose', 'one', 'masterpieces', 'modern', 'scientific', 'literature.The', 'film', 'good', 'best', 'moments', 'manage', 'illustrate', 'effectively', 'Darwin', 'view', 'world', 'natural', 'features', 'must', 'be', 'understood', 'product', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'survival', 'entertaining', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'deliver', 'compelling', 'performances', 'bit', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'though', 'tastes', 'real', 'drama', 'ideas', 'here', 'sense', 'struggle', 'discovery', 'rather', 'theory', 'evolution', 'treated', 'already', 'worked', 'out', 'only', 'issue', 'Darwin', 'emotional', 'fortitude', 'publish', 'account', 'can', 'reconcile', 'wife', 'Emma', 'achieve', 'closure', 'anger', 'God', 'death', 'daughter']",Creation anglais

1287800,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,B002T5QM42,"Phred ""Phred""","[1, 2]","First a few facts: Charles Darwin did not invent the term evolution. It was a topic that had been under discussion in several forms for some time before Darwin began his important works. His training had originally been religious based as virtually all advanced educational institutions of his day were operated by one or another religion. He was deeply concerned with the possible debates that would arise out of his books. This was part of the reason why he was so slow to publish. Once it became known to him that his reluctance might cause him to lose his standing as a foundational voice in the modern theory and fact of evolution he did complete and publish. His wife was perhaps more religious than he was he was and she did express religious-based reservations. However she was closely associated with the production of his books as an editor and ultimately a staunch supporter of her husband.With that as background I ow move into my opinions of the movie Creation. In terms of photography, costumes much of the acting this is a good movie. In terms of the writing and directing it does not seem like a reasonable portrayal of the facts. There is too much melodrama around the personal issues Charles Darwin as a father and especially as a person who had suffered the loss of a favorite daughter. It is a matter of history that Darwin did lose a daughter and that he lived in the time when it was normal for people to give themselves over to their emotions in the face of such a loss. In the context of his time many people lost children. Whatever the degree to which this loss scarred the Darwin family too much is made of how it might have affected his work as a biologist.Had this been a fictional movie rather than historical fiction, had the writer found a way to disconnect his themes from the life of the real Charles Darwin this could have been a fairly good period piece. The effort to cast the evolution debate in the religious literalism versus science argument of the 21st century is not too far-fetched in that the modern argument is not radically different from the 19th century argument. What I find myself objecting to is the relative imbalance and implied directorial inability to thread this movie between Darwin's domestic emotional stresses, his religious and scientific internal conflicts and his social and professional external responsibilities. If that reads as a somewhat thrown together sentence; there is a similar feel to the movie.There are other dramas and historic movie bios of Charles Darwin.

His hydrotherapist physician sees that Darwin needs more than physical treatment, and encourages him to talk through his remorse, guilt, loss, fear, and self-punishment.(Also a nice connection to Thomas DeQuincy, laudanum--opium, and the power of the unconscious.  Also an interesting follow-up, with Darwin and wife resuming sexual relations--Bettany and Connelly are in fact husband and wife.)The acting is simply wonderful throughout.Connelly manages to be both believably religious/rigid and loving and forgiving.

So I was really excited to see them both in a film on a topic that I am fascinated with - Darwin.  This film did not follow the voyage of the Beagle instead taking place after his return as he continues his experiments and begins writing up his findings.  This movie was far more about his relationships with his family, his children and his crisis of faith at the loss of his favorite daughter and how that affects his work, and his sanity.  I found the performances to be fantastic - the scenes with the orangutang were not to be missed.  And I didn't see that this was offensive in any way (as some people mentioned on other review sites) because it is a personal story.  No where does it say that religion is right or wrong, it instead focuses on Darwin as a person as he wrestles with what his findings may do to the religious society.I found this to be a very slow, but interesting film that opened my eyes to another side of the man who still creates so much controversy even today.Acting: ADirecting: BSpecial Effects: NoneScript: B- (there were some confusing parts... it cleared up at the end but I feel there may have been a more effective way to handle this)Overall: B+",4,"I was confused, but I really enjoyed it",1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,1212,"['love', 'Bettaney', 'Connolly', 'So', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'film', 'topic', 'am', 'fascinated', 'Darwin', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'voyage', 'Beagle', 'instead', 'taking', 'place', 'return', 'experiments', 'begins', 'writing', 'up', 'findings', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'relationships', 'family', 'children', 'crisis', 'faith', 'loss', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'how', 'work', 'sanity', 'found', 'performances', 'be', 'fantastic', 'scenes', 'orangutang', 'were', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'was', 'offensive', 'way', 'people', 'mentioned', 'other', 'review', 'sites', 'personal', 'story', 'where', 'say', 'religion', 'right', 'wrong', 'instead', 'Darwin', 'person', 'what', 'findings', 'may', 'do', 'religious', 'society.I', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'slow', 'interesting', 'film', 'opened', 'eyes', 'side', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'so', 'much', 'controversy', 'even', 'today.Acting', 'ADirecting', 'BSpecial', 'Effects', 'NoneScript', 'B-', 'were', 'confusing', 'parts', 'cleared', 'up', 'end', 'feel', 'there', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'way', 'handle', 'Overall', 'B+']",Creation anglais

Two, his ultimate revelation of a controversial truth that effects our view of all life from beginning of time to an unexpected future.My biased point being, creation is a fluid thing generation to generation. Going in, we are so certain of our belief; then leaving, the inescapable truth that God has been in control long before our perception (or even our creation) of a God existed. I'm sure God marvels at how short sited we are as the best representation of the best thought in the divine mind.I've tried to be concise.

As well, Emma was a very religious person.)This film is partly biographical, partly fictionalized account of English naturalist Charles Darwin's (1809 to 1882) relationship with his eldest daughter, Annie (1841 to 1851), as he struggles to write his scientific masterpiece ""The Origin of Species.""  The important thing to realize is that this film is not a documentary nor does it claim to be one.(Actually, the 1859 first edition of Darwin's book was entitled ""On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.""  It was for the sixth edition that Darwin shortened its title to ""The Origin of Species."")This film is based on Randal Keynes' best-selling biography of Darwin entitled ""Annie's Box.""  Keynes is the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin.Much of the film took place at Darwin's home, Down House in Kent, England.I was impressed with the factual information presented.  All the major players who influenced Darwin and urged him to publish are shown and the actors do good jobs in their roles.  Special kudos must go to Paul Bettany for his superb portrayal of Charles Darwin, a tricky role when you consider that Bettany had to show how Darwin evolved from creationist to rationalist.At the end of the movie, facts are presented on-screen.  My favourite:""Charles Darwin's ""The Origin of Species"" was sold out on its day of publication.""Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2010) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has many interesting extras.In conclusion, this is a deeply human film that allows the viewer to be entertained and educated (a rare combination these days) at the same time.  I leave you with the last words of this movie (that are part of a very powerful and poignant final scene).  Note that these are the actual words Darwin used in the last sentence of his scientific masterpiece:""There is grandeur in this view of life [that is, grandeur in the laws of nature], that whilst this planet has gone cycling according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning, endless forms [of life], most beautiful and most wonderful, have been, and are being, evolved.""(2009;  1 hr, 50 min;  wide screen;  24 scenes)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5,The man behind the scientific masterpiece,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,2706,"['XXXXX', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'Origin', 'Species', 'first', 'published', '1859', 'been', 'called', 'biggest', 'single', 'idea', 'history', 'thought.This', 'story', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'written', 'above', 'printed', 'on-screen', 'beginning', 'wonderful', 'film', 'real-life', 'married', 'couple', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Charles', 'Emma', 'Darwin', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'environment', 'was', 'one', 'extreme', 'supernaturalism', 'well', 'Emma', 'was', 'very', 'religious', 'person', 'film', 'partly', 'biographical', 'partly', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'English', 'naturalist', 'Charles', 'Darwin', '1809', '1882', 'relationship', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Annie', '1841', '1851', 'write', 'scientific', 'masterpiece', 'Origin', 'Species', 'important', 'thing', 'realize', 'film', 'not', 'documentary', 'claim', 'be', 'one', 'Actually', '1859', 'first', 'edition', 'Darwin', 'book', 'was', 'entitled', 'Origin', 'Species', 'Means', 'Natural', 'Selection', 'Preservation', 'Favoured', 'Races', 'Struggle', 'Life', 'was', 'sixth', 'edition', 'Darwin', 'shortened', 'title', 'Origin', 'Species', 'film', 'based', 'Randal', 'Keynes', 'best-selling', 'biography', 'Darwin', 'entitled', 'Annie', 'Box', 'Keynes', 'great-great-grandson', 'Charles', 'Darwin.Much', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'Darwin', 'home', 'Down', 'House', 'Kent', 'England.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'factual', 'information', 'presented', 'major', 'players', 'who', 'influenced', 'Darwin', 'urged', 'publish', 'are', 'shown', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'jobs', 'roles', 'Special', 'kudos', 'must', 'go', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'tricky', 'role', 'when', 'consider', 'Bettany', 'had', 'show', 'how', 'Darwin', 'evolved', 'creationist', 'rationalist.At', 'end', 'movie', 'facts', 'are', 'presented', 'on-screen', 'favourite', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'Origin', 'Species', 'was', 'sold', 'out', 'day', 'publication', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '2010', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'many', 'interesting', 'extras.In', 'conclusion', 'deeply', 'human', 'film', 'viewer', 'be', 'entertained', 'educated', 'rare', 'combination', 'days', 'same', 'time', 'leave', 'last', 'words', 'movie', 'are', 'part', 'very', 'powerful', 'poignant', 'final', 'scene', 'Note', 'are', 'actual', 'words', 'Darwin', 'used', 'last', 'sentence', 'scientific', 'masterpiece', 'grandeur', 'view', 'life', '[', 'grandeur', 'laws', 'nature', ']', 'planet', 'gone', 'cycling', 'according', 'fixed', 'law', 'gravity', 'so', 'simple', 'beginning', 'endless', 'forms', '[', 'life', ']', 'most', 'beautiful', 'most', 'wonderful', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'being', 'evolved', '2009', '1', 'hr', '50', 'min', 'wide', 'screen', '24', 'scenes', 'lt', 'lt', 'Stephen', 'Pletko', 'London', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '>', '>', 'XXXXX']",Creation anglais

Based on letters and journals, primarily from Darwin's children, the film offers a human look at Darwin, the man. The theory of evolution is and its ideas are introduced sporadically throughout the story, making his work secondary to the tale. Jennifer Connelly plays his concerned, somewhat non-supportive wife who too must deal the traditional ways and her love for her husband. What I loved most about the film was the magical relationship Darwin had with his daughter Annie, clearly his favorite.The downside I have is the name of the film and cover design. Darwinism has nothing to do with creation. The image of Darwin with the baby Orangutan, fingers touching are clearly symbolic of God and man in the Sistine Chapel. While Darwin's worked stepped on the church's toes (Catholic church now supports Darwin's teaching) Darwin was no astrophysicist. His work was strictly how life has evolved through small changes and variations, using his knowledge on botany. It has zero to do with creation.I did not like Bettany or Connelly in their roles, nor did I like the screenplay and directing and editing of the film. It was far too haphazard of a story. The theme, what ever it was, wasn't driven home. Bettany and Connelly lacked fire.

Just never got around to it, until last evening on a boring night.  As a professed Christian for many years, I had heard and read stories that Darwin had a death-bed conversion and recanted much of his thinking on the matter.  How true that story happens to be, no doubt only the grave knows for sure.  Whatever his eternal outcome, the movie was surprisingly different than what I anticipated.At first I thought it would be heavily focused upon his scientific beliefs and conclusions about life and its origins.  Instead, it was heavily focused upon his grief over the death of his daughter, who appeared to him often in his mind and sight.  I will say that if the producer wanted to make a movie that focused upon a stable and brilliant man, who brought forth the truth of life's existence, it sorely lacked in that aspect.  Instead, I was drawn into a man who seemed emotionally unstable, drowning in guilt and grief, rather than a rational thinking individual.  It also seemed to contradict his basic thinking that we die and that's it folks, so why the constant reincarnation of his dead daughter like a ghost who has continued to live in another form? That element of the story for me, created conflict in the theme.With that in mind, where does that leave your thoughts about Darwin himself? Were his theories tainted by his life's experience?  Does life have no meaning and all is random chance, because he could find no meaning in the death of his daughter other than the fittest survive and the weak perish?The movie was interesting and enlightening.  Somewhat slow at times.  However, the acting was quite good, and I'm a tad disappointed that my favorite Jeremy Northam had such a small role.
