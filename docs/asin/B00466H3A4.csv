In the case of SG-U they seem to have learned their lesson and have recanted to release the Full Season set after the 1.0 and 1.5. However the Caprica comittee needs to have this bashed over their frakkin' heads again. If they want the DVD sales to indicate market share and product interest they ABSOLUTELY HAVE to STOP this half-season fiasco in its tracks and roll out the FULL SEASON sets we want, deserve, demand, and will settle for nothing less than.If the forthcoming ""Chrome and Blood"" is simply a segway into the deeper stories begun in Caprica, fine.

Up against ratings juggernaut ""Dancing with the stars"", and ""Glee"", that's a good way to kill off a show. Now we have another amazing show up for destruction on Tuesday and that's ""Stargate: Universe"". Exactly Who are the idiots that made the decision to move these once great shows to Tuesday?Appearently there's no room for serious sci-fi/drama on television. I don't understand this. Is it our lack of patients to wait for a story to fully develop? Are we so sucked-in to short term gratification that we just can't wait for an issue to be resolved outside of a single episode? Now I dont know if I should invest my time in another serious sci-fi/drama on the SYFY channel because the execs themselves clearly aren't committed to making it work anymore. I fully expect SGU to end its run this year with no hope for season 3. It's a shame. SGU is a spectacular show, as well, especially when you watch it on DVD/Blu-Ray and you see it all together. WOW!

I think part of the problem was it way too slow and too much a space soap opera. It also appeared to jump around too much and was hard to follow at times.  The preview at the end of the last episode for season 2 left fans hanging wondering if there will at least be movie or video release that explains what happens next or bridges the two series.

1386396,A2DLI41UTZXHSW,B00466H3A4,Cardigan Tate,"[2, 2]","I just finished watching Caprica Season 1.5.  I discovered Battlestar Galactica on DVD and followed it avidly on the Syfy (formerly SciFi) network.  I was thrilled to see a prequel series.  I found it to have a profound emotional impact while addressing many contemporary issues in a very forward-looking way.  In its own way, it calls to mind what Star Trek did, in offering social commentary on issues that were either relevant at the time or soon would be.By the time Season 1.0 ended, I was wondering if perhaps there was too much going on all at once.  Season 1.5 really ramps it up and as it draws to its stunning climax, easily matches Battlestar Galactica at its finest, in my opinion.  There is a brief preview of what would have come had the series not been cancelled, and all I can say is, why in the world did SyFy cancel this show?  They were finally going to get into the concepts as far as the Cylons that made Battlestar Galactica such an insightful and enjoyable series to watch.I'm so disappointed that there will be no more story now that it's over.  But it's definitely worth the ride.  I hope the rumors about Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome will materialize into a full show that will continue this mythology soon.

I made it 5 episodes in this one before moving onto the real star of the whole franchise. Well for Caprica, the idea is a neat one, I'll admit. There aren't many good scifi shows (or that many actually good shows on currently on SYFY to begin with) that wants to pull the audience into a different world or universe where it has it's own history, look, and feel to it while making it pretty darn realistic. Much like how Star Trek the Next Generation or Deep Space Nine did for me as a kid....But for Caprica, the wonder dwindles VERY FAST. The idea of how the Cylons got to the point of hating the humanity of the colonies is still something that I wished they worked on more and a completely different manner than how it became on Caprica. The first 3 episodes do start great, but just drag almost immediately and has moments that the show's developers think is interesting, but ultimately just make it a complete yawn fest. I actually threw up my hands and cheered ""FINALLY!"" when I heard the infamous words: ""BY YOUR COMMAND!""  But this was probably the highlight of the show's entirety.I haven't personally got to finish this series, and I really don't want to. When it was still on syFy, I tried two more episodes after the series's midseason break, and I still could not get into it. By that point, I was already in season 3 of Battlestar Galactica. There is a huge enjoyment gap between the two.My suggestion, skip out on this, and watch the REAL prequel, Blood & Chrome.

The first episode (April 2009) came out and BAM!  Gangbusters!  Had me hook, I wanted to see more. But it was only available as a download or a DVD.  The Jan 22, 2010 is when the broadcast version of Caprica came out NINE MONTHS LATER.  You are asking people to wait 9 months, people move on.  This is either the fault of the producers or SyFy or both.  So, from episode to episode it would just let out bits and pieces, which was fine, but the BIG HUGE MISTAKE was breaking the ONLY Season into two parts.  This doomed the show.  Because it ended in the middle and early, Season 1.0 ended in March 2010 with no explanation.  That is when the show lost a HUGE percent of its viewers.  The show started back up 7 months later, in October of 2010, with absolutely no fanfare.  Lucky for me, I had order the Season Pass on iTunes.  The show ran 4 weeks in October and then on one night, in January, 3 months later, it just threw the last 5 episodes which at least two of them broadcasting before primetime and one broadcasting late night.  Now I am hoping that Ron D. Moore would find another home for this.  I think it should go true cable and air on Showtime.Now with that out of the way, the last 5 episodes were amazing.  And this show needs a second season because so many things are left unanswered.  The have a nice little wrap up at the end of Caprica with what looks like previews for Season 2.  So it seems as if some things have already been film.  I don't see the harm for SyFy network.  Unfortunately SyFy is own by NBC so it can't truly be the independent network that it should be.  Nevermind about all that.  More Caprica.  I thought all the actors were really good on the show.  Its amazing that they had the talents of Esai Morales and Eric Stoltz.It's really good to watch the series, episode after episode so the DVDs are worth purchasing.  The show seems to work better when you can sit down and watch them back to back to back.  Otherwise, the episodes seem to have odd points of ending.  I think the writers didn't know what direction they wanted to go into.  Did they want to talk about the creation of the cylon or did they want to talk about how Adama came to be, because there were two distinct story lines going on.

I'm sure Caprica pushed the envelope too far in too many directions for some viewers. The characters are never consistently sympathetic, and the Taurons are complete boors (isn't that like real life?). How do terrorists think? The writers take the question seriously. The sets make no attempt to depart from earth norms where not relevant to the storyline - I thought this was an elegant solution to a perpetual problem in science fiction, and if you think Moore is on his own here, check out Alphaville, by Godard (who uses a Ford Galaxy to represent ""inter-galactic space""). Aspects of the storyline are maddening (oops - real life again!). I have struggled with not liking the characters in Caprica. This is a trend in current science fiction television - consider Stargate Universe as well. (In SGU, I was fine with the unlikable characters, but I am very tired of unlikable aliens - which SGU initially dispensed with, and which Caprica has no requirement for - a plus in my book!) What has finally brought me around with Caprica is the brilliant portrayal of the complex relationship of the Graystones. Science fiction isn't supposed to be about ""character development,"" yet Moore and company have shown that you can develop characters and still make science fiction. They even brought in a soap opera guy for the second half. Unconventional, but it worked! Bully for them, this is worthwhile stuff. Yes, Caprica is hard to watch at times - many times.

It includes the series finale.  There is and will not be a Season 2.  The story is complete in one season.  I mention these things because of comments in other reviews.I wondered as I contemplated seeing this series whether it could be anywhere near as good as Battlestar Galactica, the reimagined version.  The latter was one of my favorite TV shows, and definitely my favorite Sci Fi so far.I would not call the Caprica series essential to those who watched BSG, but it IS interesting.  It provides a background story on key plot elements from BSG, such as the rise of the robots and how and why the became enemies of the people of Caprica, as well as the rise of the religious conflict between the monotheists and the polytheists, who in BSG seem to be the robots vs the people.  In Caprica, the monotheists are also people, and they are regarded as terrorists.Oppressed people, people who are not treated fairly, sometimes resort to violent means to change the system.  One can be sympathetic to the monotheists for being oppressed.  At the same time, they have a darker side, as you'll learn in this part of the series.The writers sure love plot twists.  But the oddest thing of all was while watching the season finale, which for the first half seemed to be going at the same leisurely pace of the rest of the series, was how it suddenly went into warp drive (sorry) and gave us the highlights of the rest of the story.  But thinking back on this, I think it actually worked well.  And the story did add a couple of key pieces of the puzzle into place.Very satisfying, even if it was not as compelling as BSG.

Caprica is a great show concerning the evolution of how we arrive in the world of Battle Star Galactica which was a big success.  The sets are amazing as the 12 colonies get explored along with the feud between Caprica and Turron.  How will man use artificial intelligence in robotics and virtual reality?  For some Earthlings of today this may seem very unlikely, but in the near future we will be asking ourselves what ethics and usage do we apply to these upcoming sciences.You will seldom find a better acted series.  My favorite actor on the show is Eric Stolz, but also Alessandra Torresani and Lucy Rand (from Kyle XY) are outstanding.  The rest of the cast are also outstanding, the characters are well developed including a limited role for James Marsters (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel).Caprica does make you think about the conflicts of religion, cyber terrorism and culture.  Caprica does make us think about poly relationships, sexual fantasy, life after death through transference to the virtual world and/or the cybernetic world.  Perhaps too few of the human race are ready to think in more than two dimensions.  If you are a person who has an advanced mind set I encourage you to add your review, to contact SyFy, to contact NBC/Universal to save Caprica.

Pristine 480p image that absolutely makes the most of the format, and a solid sound mix.  There are tons of deleted scenes, and the season/series finale has one of the most fascinating audio commentaries I've ever sat through (given to us by showrunner Kevin Murphy, he spills a lot of details about what his plans were for a future season).At times, I had a hard time sticking with Caprica ... I never really felt like I had a character to root for.  But the last five episodes (incidentally the ones that were pulled from the season schedule when they were supposed to originally air on Syfy), are some of the most fantastic episodes of TV I have seen.  There is a five minute &#34;coda&#34; at the end, that works as a perfect ending to the series, even though the show runners were hoping it would be renewed for another season.Overall, I can't blame the viewers for tuning out of this show, but it ended with some of the strongest episodes I could imagine.

While the visuals (design and fx-wise) of ""Caprica"" have always been inspired (if sometimes rather derivative), here they improve vastly in dramatic impact as the storylines intensify in stakes and complexity.But, alas, that evil stupid channel cancelled this show, and we are left with.....?  Well, it doesn't just ""stop,"" like the TV shows of old often seemed to do (re: ""Star Trek:TOS""); no infamously terrible ""I-hate-you-studio-for-cancelling-our-show-so-we'll-insult-the-fans"" debacle like ""ST: Enterprise,"" either, thankfully.

I'm still debating the relative merit and result of this, but these last episodes generally seem to work.It all gets to a point where the last ten minutes of the finale are as much an extended preview of the next season(s) that could have been, as they are a desperate quickie tie-them-together montage of subsequent events that lead to the rest of ""BSG"" Redux's backstory. And, crazily enough, it works. Should there have been another season or two of ""Caprica?"" Sure. Are we better off not having had them, and therefore these last episodes with its crazy montage-cum-quasi-preview can be considered plenty? Maybe.

1386438,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00466H3A4,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","Although shot in HD, ""Caprica"" is (as of this writing) only available on DVD (why Universal has been reluctant to release this considering how well the original series sold is beyond me. They DID release ""The Plan"" and ""Blood and Chrome"" in HD on Blu-ray as well as DVD). The HD transfers for the show were already prepared for the French release and HD broadcasts so it would be very simple to port those over to a U.S. release (evidently the French release is non-region BUT because it is 1080/50i, some players may have a difficult time playing them so you are gambling if you have a U.S. player).This is the second half of the season.Regardless, ""Caprica"" was a fascinating series that showed a lot of promise giving us background on the early development of the Cylons and WHY they were created, touching on how they developed consciousness as well. For those of you on the fence, you could stream it here before purchasing (if you choose to do so) or at Netflix (I think it's still there).SPOILERS:Set 60 years before the Human/Cylon War, Caprica introduces us to two families the Adams and Greystones. Lawyer Joseph Adams (Esai Morales) tries to escape his unsavory past but still has to work for the organized crime family that provided his education. He struggles with his past and trying to keep his son Willy on the straight and narrow path.The Graystones are led by Daniel Graystone (Eric Stoltz) who uses his company to eventually develop Cylon technology after the death of a loved one.END OF SPOILERS:""Caprica"" revisits the conflict between the polytheist humans and a radical religious movement that believes in monotheism and will do anything to advance their own agenda including terrorism. As with ""BSG"" there are a number of complex themes that bubble up during the first and only season of the series. Luckily, the writers/producers managed to tie up most of the loose ends of the series during the first season so the show is largely self contained.I don't understand the marketing team and executives at Syfy which commissioned the series; while the ratings weren't as strong for ""BSG"", they elected to cancel the show after a mid-season cliffhanger and then waited months to air the remaining episodes losing any potential momentum and audience the series had. While the network has taken some bold risks at times, they've primarily made bone headed moves when it comes to promoting their series. If they had given ""Caprica"" another season I don't doubt that the show would have found an audience as well as its legs as the last five episodes found writers/producers David Eick and Ronald Moore finding ""voice"" of the series.Perhaps Syfy felt it needed to run more reality shows or wrestling at the time but either way the network did a disservice to the series and fans by how they handed the series.The DVD looks exceptionally good with nice detail. The look of the show is deliberately on the cool side. The audio is terrific as well on the DVDs.The special features are solid for the set. We get podcasts, commentary tracks, deleted scenes and 30 minutes of videoblogs that originally were at the website for the series.Although ""Caprica"" failed to capture a large audience and stumbled a bit during its first and only season, the last five episodes bring the series to a strong conclusion that could have been built on if given a chance by the powers that be at Syfy. Sadly, that never happened but the series is still a very good show and compliments the ""BSG"" reboot that proved so popular.Recommended.",4,Very good prequel that could have become great given time and more than one season (DVD release),1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,3533,"['shot', 'HD', 'Caprica', 'writing', 'only', 'available', 'DVD', 'why', 'Universal', 'been', 'reluctant', 'release', 'considering', 'how', 'well', 'original', 'series', 'sold', 'DID', 'release', 'Plan', 'Blood', 'Chrome', 'HD', 'Blu-ray', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'HD', 'transfers', 'show', 'were', 'already', 'prepared', 'French', 'release', 'HD', 'broadcasts', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'simple', 'port', 'U.S.', 'release', 'evidently', 'French', 'release', 'non-region', 'BUT', '1080/50i', 'players', 'may', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'playing', 'are', 'gambling', 'have', 'U.S.', 'player', '.This', 'second', 'half', 'season.Regardless', 'Caprica', 'was', 'fascinating', 'series', 'showed', 'lot', 'promise', 'giving', 'background', 'early', 'development', 'Cylons', 'WHY', 'were', 'created', 'touching', 'how', 'developed', 'consciousness', 'as', 'well', 'fence', 'could', 'stream', 'here', 'purchasing', 'choose', 'do', 'so', 'Netflix', 'think', 'still', '.SPOILERS', 'Set', '60', 'years', 'Human/Cylon', 'War', 'Caprica', 'two', 'families', 'Adams', 'Greystones', 'Lawyer', 'Joseph', 'Adams', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'escape', 'unsavory', 'past', 'still', 'work', 'organized', 'crime', 'family', 'provided', 'education', 'past', 'trying', 'keep', 'son', 'Willy', 'straight', 'narrow', 'path.The', 'Graystones', 'are', 'led', 'Daniel', 'Graystone', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'who', 'company', 'eventually', 'develop', 'Cylon', 'technology', 'death', 'loved', 'one.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Caprica', 'conflict', 'polytheist', 'humans', 'radical', 'religious', 'movement', 'monotheism', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'advance', 'own', 'agenda', 'including', 'terrorism', 'BSG', 'are', 'number', 'complex', 'themes', 'bubble', 'up', 'first', 'only', 'season', 'series', 'Luckily', 'writers/producers', 'managed', 'tie', 'up', 'most', 'loose', 'ends', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'largely', 'self', 'contained.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'marketing', 'team', 'executives', 'Syfy', 'commissioned', 'series', 'ratings', 'were', ""n't"", 'strong', 'BSG', 'elected', 'cancel', 'show', 'mid-season', 'cliffhanger', 'then', 'waited', 'months', 'air', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'losing', 'potential', 'momentum', 'audience', 'series', 'had', 'network', 'taken', 'bold', 'risks', 'times', ""'ve"", 'primarily', 'made', 'bone', 'headed', 'moves', 'when', 'promoting', 'series', 'had', 'given', 'Caprica', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'legs', 'last', 'five', 'episodes', 'found', 'writers/producers', 'David', 'Eick', 'Ronald', 'Moore', 'finding', 'voice', 'series.Perhaps', 'Syfy', 'felt', 'needed', 'run', 'more', 'reality', 'wrestling', 'time', 'way', 'network', 'did', 'disservice', 'series', 'fans', 'how', 'handed', 'series.The', 'DVD', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'nice', 'detail', 'look', 'show', 'deliberately', 'cool', 'side', 'audio', 'terrific', 'as', 'well', 'DVDs.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'solid', 'set', 'get', 'podcasts', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'deleted', 'scenes', '30', 'minutes', 'videoblogs', 'originally', 'were', 'website', 'series.Although', 'Caprica', 'failed', 'capture', 'large', 'audience', 'stumbled', 'bit', 'first', 'only', 'season', 'last', 'five', 'episodes', 'bring', 'series', 'strong', 'conclusion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'given', 'chance', 'powers', 'be', 'Syfy', 'Sadly', 'never', 'happened', 'series', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'BSG', 'reboot', 'proved', 'so', 'popular.Recommended']",Caprica: Season 1.5
