921151,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B000A50442,Craig Connell,"[2, 2]","This turned out to be a ""sleeper,"" a good film that few people have heard of, I suspect, outside of Madison, Indiana. Being in an area that used to host hydroplane races, it intrigued me. I also usually enjoy movies that star Jim Caviezel.Mainly, this was a nice film with a feel-good David vs. Goliath story based on a real-life occurrence back in 1971. It involves the sport of hydroplane racing, meaning extremely fast boats raced in different bodies of water around the USA. A town nearby where I live used to have these, but I haven't heard of them in decades.Anyway, this story takes place in a small Indiana town that was on the skids by 1970 but plants closing all the time and people moving elsewhere. The hopes of its boat, ""Miss Madison"" also seem to be about lost until, as fate would have it, the town is awarded the opportunity to host the ""Gold Cup,"" the biggest event of the sport.A string of failures, followed by new disasters, include the death of the pilot, near-death of another one and the boat being just about totaled in the process. How the town - led by former racer ""Jim McCormick"" (Caviezel) - can raise the money to resurrect the town, the boat and the driver himself, are all shown here. McCormick not only has to pull off several miracles but also try to win the support of his wife and son, who have had their fill of disappointments with this sport.The film winds up being a sports movie and a drama about a family, a team of workers and an entire small town trying to pull together and beat tremendous odds. I have to use two clich&eacute;s here: it's a heartwarming story and, yes, it's a good family movie. You don't have to worry about offensive material. It reminds me, in spots, of a made-for-TV movie. It kind of plays old-fashioned corny but in a way that makes you glad you watched it.",4,David vs. Goliath Feel-Good Story,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,1827,"['turned', 'out', 'be', 'sleeper', 'good', 'film', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'heard', 'suspect', 'Madison', 'Indiana', 'Being', 'area', 'used', 'host', 'hydroplane', 'races', 'intrigued', 'also', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'star', 'Jim', 'Caviezel.Mainly', 'was', 'nice', 'film', 'feel-good', 'David', 'vs.', 'Goliath', 'story', 'based', 'real-life', 'occurrence', 'back', '1971', 'sport', 'hydroplane', 'racing', 'meaning', 'extremely', 'fast', 'boats', 'raced', 'different', 'bodies', 'water', 'USA', 'town', 'nearby', 'where', 'live', 'used', 'have', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'decades.Anyway', 'story', 'place', 'small', 'Indiana', 'town', 'was', 'skids', '1970', 'plants', 'closing', 'time', 'people', 'moving', 'elsewhere', 'hopes', 'boat', 'Miss', 'Madison', 'also', 'seem', 'be', 'lost', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'town', 'awarded', 'opportunity', 'host', 'Gold', 'Cup', 'biggest', 'event', 'sport.A', 'string', 'failures', 'followed', 'new', 'disasters', 'include', 'death', 'pilot', 'near-death', 'one', 'boat', 'being', 'just', 'about', 'totaled', 'process', 'How', 'town', 'led', 'former', 'racer', 'Jim', 'McCormick', 'Caviezel', 'can', 'raise', 'money', 'resurrect', 'town', 'boat', 'driver', 'are', 'shown', 'here', 'McCormick', 'not', 'only', 'pull', 'off', 'several', 'miracles', 'also', 'try', 'win', 'support', 'wife', 'son', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'fill', 'disappointments', 'sport.The', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'sports', 'movie', 'drama', 'family', 'team', 'workers', 'entire', 'small', 'town', 'trying', 'pull', 'together', 'beat', 'tremendous', 'odds', 'have', 'use', 'two', 'clich', 'eacute', 'here', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'yes', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'offensive', 'material', 'spots', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'kind', 'plays', 'old-fashioned', 'corny', 'way', 'glad', 'watched']",Madison

But this movie has a lot of heart and it's based on a true story.

921173,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000A50442,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[7, 7]","Unlimited hydroplane boat racing may not be the most exciting sport in the world, unless you're from Madison, Indiana, where the sport was born - then it's everything. The town even owns its own boat, the Miss Madison. But she's on her last leg and has become the laughing stock of the racing circuit, much to the unhappiness of ten-year-old Mike McCormick - played by Jake Lloyd - who is just now getting to travel with the team. As the racing commission prepares to kick Madison off the circuit so a more lucrative team can join, the luck of the draw gives Madison the opportunity to save face and their place on the circuit by hosting the 1971 Gold Cup Championship. But it means coming up with the $50,000 prize money, getting their boat in shape, and finding a new driver. Can they do it?It looks pretty hopeless to Mike, whose dad, Jim McCormick - played by Jim Caviezel (I Am David, Count of Monte Cristo, Passion of the Christ) - used to be a driver. But he was injured in an accident in which his best friend died and, since then, has contented himself with just being a part of the team. Now, as the town prepares for the Gold Cup, the driver they thought they had lined up is killed in another race. Jim sees no other way but for him to climb back into the cockpit, much to the chagrin of his wife - played by Mary McCormack - and everyone else's better judgment. Will he follow the same fate as his friend and the previous driver?There are a lot of similarities between Madison and other small-town-Indiana sports films - like Hoosers and Breaking Away. (Paul Dooley played the father in that film, and plays the mayor in this one.) William Bindley directed and co-wrote Madison with his brother, Scott, and the result is a family film with a strong message about hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness and high production values. Jim Caviezel gives his usual solid performance, as does most of the cast. There are memorable highlights, like the team stealing a World War II engine out of an antique plane on display in front of a nearby town's courthouse; a man-to-man talk disguised as a fishing trip between Mike and an old family friend - played wonderfully against type by Bruce Dern; and a great reenactment of ABC's Wide World of Sports covering the Gold Cup race. The boat racing is well filmed with a certain amount of excitement, especially in the flashback sequence.But there is something missing. Even though the stakes are high for both Madison and Jim McCormick, when it's time for the big race, I'm not on the edge of my seat. Whatever is not working has to do with the script, and that one element keeps it from being a five-star film for me. It may just be too tame; or maybe boat racing is hard for non-adherents to get excited about; or perhaps the threat of death (the real antagonist) doesn't seem great enough. Much like another Jim Caviezel sports film project, Stroke of Genius, there is nothing outstanding here.
