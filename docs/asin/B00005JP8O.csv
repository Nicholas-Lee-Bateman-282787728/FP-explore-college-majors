645978,AORXL977W3KI7,B00005JP8O,Aging  Boomer,"[1, 2]","This review has plot spoilers:""The  Return"" concerns a young woman, Joanna Mills, who is driven by unexplained memories to re-enact, and ultimately to avenge, another woman's violent death.  The link between Joanna and the dead woman is revealed to be an automobile accident years before in which the dying woman was in one car and Joanna, as a child, in the other.  An alternate ending included on the DVD release explicitly supports the notion that Joanna is the reincarnation of the dead victim.  In the original, theatrical ending Joanna's relation to the dead woman is left unresolved.  In the final scene a silent Joanna seems to have reached an inner understanding, but what that is the viewer is not told.  The ambiguity of the original ending is more interesting, if less susceptible of easy explanation.The film is a failure.  The pared down 85 minute run time suggests a desperate attempt to makes less become more, but it does no good to cut when what's left isn't any better.  There is nothing new in this move: not one line of dialogue, not one plot device, not one camera angle, not one dumbed down, faintly Buddhist idea. (In fact, the film's only plausible claim to Eastern religiosity is that it is itself the reincarnation of a half dozen better movies.) Direction is alert and competent but derivative.  The writing is mundane.  On the plus side is a somewhat compelling score, whose moodiness matches that of the film.  For reasons hard to explain, the whole thing does work somewhat better on DVD than in the theater.  Perhaps a film so small in so many ways belongs on the small screen.Sarah Michelle Gellar, however, shines, turning in a captivating performance in this uncaptivating film.  This is not a breakthrough role for her, or one in which her talents are stretched, even modestly. But she shows once again that she can hold attention in a feature film, if that needed showing, and not just by her beauty, though she is movingly beautiful here despite the film's washed out color and her character's dreary persona. Her performance is a hint of the career she is seeking to carve out for herself, in which she will perhaps become the actress we know she can be, one whose performances deepen our lives. There are several films that are NOT supernatural thrillers or horror films that she has chosen intelligently and rather courageously and that should be in theaters this year. It may not be ""Southland Tales"", but perhaps it will be ""Air I Breathe"" or ""Girl's Guide"" or one of her other gutsy choices that will demonstrate the full scope of her talents in a movie worth watching. The time has come for her to slay the ghost of Buffy (great as that show was) once and for all, and to abandon supernatural thrillers, especially ones as dull as this one.  The upcoming ""Addicted"" shows, though, that she has not shaken the genre quite yet.",3,Wonderful Sarah; mediocre movie works better on DVD,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,2870,"['review', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'Return', 'young', 'woman', 'Joanna', 'Mills', 'who', 'driven', 'unexplained', 'memories', 're-enact', 'ultimately', 'avenge', 'woman', 'violent', 'death', 'link', 'Joanna', 'dead', 'woman', 'revealed', 'be', 'automobile', 'accident', 'years', 'dying', 'woman', 'was', 'one', 'car', 'Joanna', 'child', 'other', 'alternate', 'ending', 'included', 'DVD', 'release', 'explicitly', 'notion', 'Joanna', 'reincarnation', 'dead', 'victim', 'original', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'Joanna', 'relation', 'dead', 'woman', 'left', 'unresolved', 'final', 'scene', 'silent', 'Joanna', 'have', 'reached', 'inner', 'understanding', 'what', 'viewer', 'not', 'told', 'ambiguity', 'original', 'ending', 'more', 'interesting', 'less', 'susceptible', 'easy', 'explanation.The', 'film', 'failure', 'pared', 'down', '85', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'less', 'become', 'more', 'good', 'cut', 'when', 'what', 'left', ""n't"", 'better', 'nothing', 'new', 'move', 'not', 'one', 'line', 'dialogue', 'not', 'one', 'plot', 'device', 'not', 'one', 'camera', 'angle', 'not', 'one', 'dumbed', 'down', 'faintly', 'Buddhist', 'idea', 'fact', 'film', 'only', 'plausible', 'claim', 'Eastern', 'religiosity', 'reincarnation', 'half', 'dozen', 'better', 'movies', 'Direction', 'alert', 'competent', 'derivative', 'writing', 'mundane', 'plus', 'side', 'somewhat', 'compelling', 'score', 'moodiness', 'film', 'reasons', 'hard', 'explain', 'whole', 'thing', 'work', 'somewhat', 'better', 'DVD', 'theater', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'so', 'small', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'belongs', 'small', 'screen.Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'however', 'shines', 'turning', 'captivating', 'performance', 'uncaptivating', 'film', 'not', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'one', 'talents', 'are', 'stretched', 'even', 'modestly', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'hold', 'attention', 'feature', 'film', 'needed', 'showing', 'not', 'just', 'beauty', 'movingly', 'beautiful', 'here', 'film', 'washed', 'out', 'color', 'character', 'dreary', 'persona', 'performance', 'hint', 'career', 'seeking', 'carve', 'out', 'herself', 'will', 'perhaps', 'become', 'actress', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'performances', 'deepen', 'lives', 'are', 'several', 'films', 'are', 'NOT', 'supernatural', 'thrillers', 'horror', 'films', 'chosen', 'intelligently', 'rather', 'courageously', 'should', 'be', 'theaters', 'year', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Southland', 'Tales', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'Air', 'Breathe', 'Girl', 'Guide', 'one', 'other', 'gutsy', 'choices', 'will', 'demonstrate', 'full', 'scope', 'talents', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'time', 'come', 'slay', 'ghost', 'Buffy', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'once', 'abandon', 'supernatural', 'thrillers', 'especially', 'ones', 'as', 'dull', 'one', 'upcoming', 'Addicted', 'though', 'not', 'shaken', 'genre', 'quite', 'yet']",The Return

Joanna (Gellar) has been having recurring visions and waking nightmares about a woman being murdered. Guided by the visions, she goes to La Salle, Texas to seek answers about the woman and her killer who might just be after her next. We learn that Joanna and her father have been in a car accident when she was eleven years old that changed her completely. Who is the woman she sees in her visions? Is everything related?The trailers for this film will have you think you're gearing up to watch a supernatural horror film; make no mistake, this film is a thriller, and not a horror film. The first half-hour is extremely slow-paced and quite uninteresting. I just couldn't get into this movie. As the story unfolds, I became curious to see how things would turn out, desperately hoping there was more going on than what was on the surface. Sadly, there wasn't much behind the shell of this film. The twist ending disappointed me terribly. Go in the special features on the DVD and watch the alternate ending, which is, in my opinion, a much more satisfying ending. By changing a few details in the plot, that ending could've been used and would definitely have been a more powerful way to finish the film.On the up side, the director shows promise with stylish compositions, shaky cam shots that put you in the middle of the action (and manage to make you jump once or twice). Gellar gives a subdued performance appropriate for the part. The supporting cast is also effective in their roles. The score was subtle, the cinematography made you feel Texas in all its glorious heat and Joanna's nightmares at their seedy best.If you're looking for a horror film, look elsewhere. If you're a fan of Gellar, you might enjoy it more than I did.

Everything's so dreary it's almost like the film is in black and white.  While Sarah Michelle Gellar is a great actress and really fits the roll for any kind of suspense or horror storyline (not to mention one of the hottest women I've ever seen) something was missing in this movie.The main story was really not that interesting, or intense.  It was good enough to keep me watching, but in the end, I'd rather see the Ring or the Grudge again.  Watching Sarah Michelle explore a nearly deserted town for an hour and a half wasn't as scary as it probably sounds.She's basically going around trying to find clues about a murder, and while this is happening, strange things start to happen to Sarah.  Throughout the film, she sees things that aren't really there.  While that's not really the problem I have with the movie, it's not as suspenseful as I had hoped.  I can't figure out why either.Most of the time thrillers such as this one have a complex story that makes me want to come back and see it again.  However, the plot was so obvious in this film, I don't know if I will return (no pun intended) to it again any time soon.Despite my complaints, it was a good movie and definitely worth watching.

645987,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JP8O,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 8]","""The Return"" is the kind of supernatural thriller you have to force yourself to sit through. Already this isn't a good sign. There were a couple of moments when I felt ready to leave the theater, not because the content was disturbing, but because the plot was needlessly confusing. The first hour of this film made absolutely no sense; it drifted from one scene to the next with nothing stringing them together. It was like watching the reedited fragments of various ghost stories. It's a good thing the ending connected most of the missing pieces by validating the previous scenes. I can say with complete honesty that I didn't leave the theater feeling as if I had been ripped off (not completely, anyway); what started out as a complete mess ended up as a definite story.Unfortunately, this doesn't make the film worth recommending. Despite the fact that many of the plot's loose ends were eventually tied up, I still felt that it went a long way for very little. It vaguely resembles a ghost story, one in which otherworldly powers are used on a living person in order to warn and/or help another living person. Furthermore, the characters are defined by cliches so well established that one wonders how the story would survive on its own. You won't find anything original or inspiring about ""The Return,"" which I suppose wouldn't have been so bad had the filmmakers attempted to reinterpret some aspect of the genre. Then again, that may be asking too much, especially when you consider how successful many of the more formulaic ghost films have been.Apparently, the filmmakers tried to poke the audience along by presenting them with small snippets of information, hopefully enough snippets to peak their interest. This method has worked before in other such films, but it didn't work too well with this one. I certainly wish it had; it would have made the initial randomness seem more like an opportunity for us to use our heads as opposed to a self-serving excuse for cryptic imagery. Sarah Michelle Gellar--fresh from her appearance in last month's ""The Grudge 2""--plays Joanna Mills, a young businesswoman who, for as yet unknown reasons, has terrible visions of a man and a murdered woman. It would seem that she's had them ever since she was a little girl, as first seen during the opening flashback sequence of her and her father, Ed (Sam Shepard), at a local carnival.In present day, she's an ambitious businesswoman working for an oil company based in St. Louis. One day, she's given the opportunity to make a sale in her home state of Texas, specifically in a town called Salle. It's intriguing that she made this decision; before this job opportunity, she had never considered stepping foot into that city. This is because she's had visions of it, much like those of the unknown man and woman. What's worse, her visions force her into acts of self-mutilation, such as cutting into her leg or forehead. Why, I'm not exactly sure; the connections are never fully developed, even by the end of the film. I did get the sense that the filmmakers tried to make the connection crystal clear; because Joanna left Texas under dubious circumstances, and because her family and friends have remained there, tension exists between everyone involved.But the idea never got off the ground, and that only made the ensuing mystery unnecessarily confusing. Upon entering Salle, Joanna checks into a drab hotel/slaughterhouse (a combination only possible in a supernatural thriller). She then investigates an unnamed local bar, the same one she's been having visions of lately. It would seem that the visions are getting more and more frequent, and for some reason, they all connect with her personally. She struggles to find out why, especially when loner Terry Stahl (Peter O'Brien) comes into the picture. He introduces himself by saving her from her jealous coworker, Kurt (Adam Scott). While Joanna was grateful for Stahl's help, the locals respond with utter disdain. His girlfriend, Annie (Erinn Allison), had been murdered some years earlier, and everyone is convinced that he committed the crime.Whether or not he did, I dare not say. What I do dare say is that the relationship between him and Joanna is growing, as are her visions, which are gradually becoming more understandable. Consider the fact that she had painted several seahorse pictures as a child; is it any coincidence that Annie had painted something very similar on the inside wall of her barn? Of course it isn't, and neither is the fact that other such visions are leading up to the revelation of Annie's killer. But the question remains: why is Joanna involved at all? Furthermore, why has she been plagued with these mental images for the past fifteen years? How is she to know what to do if she acts on her instincts?Interestingly enough, these are the exact same questions that ran through my head. Even when everything is explained at the end of the film, an adequate reason for her involvement remains elusive. I didn't feel as if anything had been gained by it, and I should think nothing much would have been lost without her. This is a bad thing; Joanna was created as a heroine figure, yet she's included in a story that doesn't really need one. I say this because the ultimate purpose of ""The Return"" is to give a grandiose message about something that's relatively miniscule. To be perfectly honest, there was no reason for this story to be told at all; while it wasn't particularly bad, it's still a mere blip on the cinematic radar, one that hardly deserves any special attention. Too bad for Sarah Michelle Gellar; that's what she gets for starring in two ghost movies released less than a month apart.",3,While Visions of Murderers Danced in Her Head,1163116800,"11 10,

At least in films like The Ring, the visual effects and the scares are frequent and good. In this offering, there are little or no special effects. The film has a surreal effect which is very very annoying as nothing is explained. Sarah Michelle Gellar literally sleepwalks her way through the role. It's a bad film in all honesty. A mind numbing bore from start to finish. They could have edited it down to 30 minutes from its 85 minutes and not have lost a jot of the storyline or what flimsy plot that there is. There are little or no scares either.This film probably spells the end of Sarah Michelle Gellar. She has blown it big time after the success of The Grudge.

From the settings all the way to the people she is seeing. And even people from her past may or may not show up.This was surprisingly better than I thought it would be, my own fault I guess. I thought with the star here and just the look of the thing it would be, well not so good. To my surprise it is really well done and the atmosphere of the film is great.

Gellar plays Joanna Mills, a 25 year old travelling saleswoman who has been experiencing weird flashbacks to events that she never experienced, ever since she was 11.

Did she really witness a woman's murder and is someone now trying to kill her?Pity also the viewer of this movie. As I saw this movie, I too was overwhelmed by a strong feeling of deja vu.

This film merely serves to demonstrate why she has never managed to rise above B-grade horror movies. The story is often hard to follow and the payoff at the end is not adequate to compensate the viewer for the confusion that they are forced to experience.

I rented ""The Return"" as part of a usual Saturday horror-film fest. The PG-13 rating was the first thing that caught my attention...however, there have been a few good PG 13 horror films, at least in my opinion (What Lies Beneath, The Ring), but they are somewhat of a rarity. I guess I should have figured that this one staring Sarah Michelle Gellar probably wouldn't stand the test of taste. So what's missing?A good horror film is like a good speech, book, article....what not. You have an introduction, a body and a conclusion. Well, we start off with an introduction. It was good, nice set-up, good acting, great environment. However, the introduction never seems to end. When you're 45 minutes into the film and so far all you've seen were a few flashy images, loud smash cuts, and eerie music, as the main character walks around in circles, it's just time to start something new. The scariest part had to be when I ran out of ice cream! In element we've gone from horror film to drama, with little to no plot advancement. Then we start a romance which seems way out of character to me for a career obsessed traveling sales-woman. If anything, this movie is more of a drama about strange stalkers who all seem to specifically go after Sarah (well, she is hott...).Reality: The film seems pretty real, all except for one spot where she reaches for a knife on the stairs after being cornered, yet she caries a switchblade in her boot...what?? Yet the rest of the film seems to be pretty realistic and the characters act somewhat reasonable.Plot: Ok, so it's not very intriguing. The story is a drama, not a horror film. Don't expect to be scared, but you'll probably jump at a few of the smash-cuts. Most of the plot carries Sarah around as she tries to figure out her past and why she's connected to this small Texas town. The creators gave a bit too much away too early and you figure most everything out before the third act. Nothing new, nothing interesting....it's just as it is. There's an interesting final twist at the end, but that's going to just about cover it. The final scene is just a simple fade to black. Everything comes together, and all is as it should be in the world.Effects: Yeah, um...virtually, there are no effects. So if you're looking for monsters, blood, gore, that sort of thing, don't rent this guy. There are a few vehicle wrecks which were pretty exciting, but that's about all the icing on this cake...Film elements; Acting, camera, lighting, sound, music....the rest is all about what you'd expect from a common drama. It's all placed together pretty well in a nice coherent manner. It's definitely a budgeted film, and lives up to hollywood standards by all means. Definitely technically sounds. A slight desaturated color scheme spills over the film's ""style,"" and some strange quick zoom in, blur, quick zoom out type camera work adds to it. I'm not sure I particularly enjoyed this, but it's something I haven't seen to often.All-in-all, it's you average film, nothing new, nothing exciting, but it should please the drama or thriller fans. It's definitely no horror film and will provide little excitement to the die-hard horror fan.

Jongeling ""slice of heaven""","[0, 0]","There's more than enough reviews for this film, but I will add to them by saying that while this film isn't incredible, it's also not a terrible film either.The whole film has this dreary autumn vibe to it, as a woman haunted by visions of her past that she doesn't quite remember seeks out to find what really happened in the small town of La Salle, TX (which, ironically, is a very small non-governmental community that many people don't know much about).""The Return"" of course suffers from the usual repetitiveness and cringe factor that most modern ""horror"" movies suffer from, i.e. static on the radio hearing voices, faces in the mirror, screams in the dark...all that stuff that almost every horror film in the past 15 years has incorporated and overdone. (It's been done so much, in fact, that when watching a horror film I give uber kudos if it doesn't happen and instead incorporates something original.)The plot twist is very nice, as is the alternate ending (although I think they cut it so that Terry didn't appear old enough to be the girl's father, which might have been creepy considering their mini make-out session at the end of the alternate ending).Ultimately I was left desiring more. If the film had not omitted the deleted scenes, it would have been a much more enjoyable movie. The omitted scenes provided a maturity and a deeper insight and texture to the life of the character and the thickness of the plot. It would have made the movie so much better, but instead they cut it down to some cheap thriller with no texture. Doesn't that make you angry?Oh well. Am I angry I spent $1 for a rental? Nah. I just wouldn't spend money to own it.Again, I'm being candid. If they left the deleted scenes in the movie, it would have been a much better film.

Okay, don't call me baised, actually, because I really didn't enjoy the movie.I don't know what it was about The Return that just never drew me in. It had Sarah Michelle Gellar. She was beautiful. Her turn as Joanne - the work obssessed, hallucinating, very confused young woman - was pretty mild comparer to other characters I've seen Sarah portray. I was actually bored while watching her. She seemed one dimensional. Pain was her only drive, and she just kept putting more on herself (character-wise and acting-wise).The story of Joanna - that being she keeps seeing visions of a murdered woman that somehow connects to Joanna's past - wasn't even that interesting. While it could have been played out to make the story interesting, nothing ever happened. We just got drawn out scenes in which Joanna would mope or explore (and never find anything), or we would get a small chase / scare scene that never really resulted in anything but trying to draw up suspense. It failed.One thing I did enjoy about The Return was the bleak color filters that were used throughout the film. A mixture of browns, oranges, and greys joined the tone of the film, or rather the tone that should have been with the film. And the whispering of ""Sunshine.""

The chemistry between the two is undeniable and really did carry the movie far.Important thing to know is that I didn't sit through the film hiding behind a cushion hence proving my point that this isn't some random ""ghostly cheap scare movie"". In fact they kept the annoying ""jump out of nowhere and scare the pants off you"" scenes to a minimum and the ones they have wasn't that scary either.Yes, for the first twenty minutes of the film, it was difficult to follow due to the pacing of the film. However, as the movie progresses the pieces started to fit together and the final scene whereby they reveled how the connection between Joanna and terry's lover was established was truly emotional and provided a satisfying finish to the film.If you're looking to scare yourself silly go get ""the grudge"" DVD but if you are looking for something that has depth with actual storylines, this movie is for you.Bottom line, this movie has potential but this potential was sadly trampled by the tactless marketing.",5,"This is NOT a grudge type movie, don't be fooled by the marketing!",1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,1856,"['Okay', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'am', 'utterly', 'disgusted', 'fact', 'were', 'trying', 'market', 'grudge', 'type', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'well', 'box', 'only', 'similarity', 'grudge', 'movie', 'feature', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'lead', 'role', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'promoted', 'release', 'respect', 'trailer', 'as', 'well', 'poster', 'fooled', 'quite', 'number', 'people', 'including', 'who', 'die-hard', 'Gellar', 'fan', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'yet', 'ghostly', 'cheap', 'scare', 'flick.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'today', 'had', 'chance', 'view', 'movie', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'wrongly', 'promoted', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'truly', 'solid', 'plot', 'backed', 'substantial', 'performance', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Peter', ""O'Brien"", 'chemistry', 'two', 'undeniable', 'really', 'did', 'carry', 'movie', 'far.Important', 'thing', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'film', 'hiding', 'cushion', 'hence', 'proving', 'point', ""n't"", 'random', 'ghostly', 'cheap', 'scare', 'movie', 'fact', 'kept', 'annoying', 'jump', 'nowhere', 'scare', 'pants', 'scenes', 'minimum', 'ones', 'have', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'either.Yes', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'difficult', 'follow', 'due', 'pacing', 'film', 'However', 'movie', 'pieces', 'started', 'fit', 'together', 'final', 'scene', 'whereby', 'reveled', 'how', 'connection', 'Joanna', 'terry', 'lover', 'was', 'established', 'was', 'truly', 'emotional', 'provided', 'satisfying', 'finish', 'film.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'scare', 'silly', 'go', 'get', 'grudge', 'DVD', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'depth', 'actual', 'storylines', 'movie', 'you.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'potential', 'potential', 'was', 'sadly', 'trampled', 'tactless', 'marketing']",The Return

There's no gratuitous gore or blood, just a really good, strong story with good acting.What I didn't like was the sped-up shoots and the flushing of colors, or fade into black and white.

The story, about a young businesswoman who begins to have strange hallucinations, is meted out in artful bits that play mum with their secrets until the final frames of the film.  As some have remarked, this is not unlikeThe Sixth Sense, but that movie's twist was propelled by the plot, and the meat of the movie had enough drama to keep less astute viewers interested.  ""The Return,"" on the other hand, spends ninety minutes making very little sense at all and taking its sweet time to do so.An oddly aged Sarah Michelle Gellar plays our lead, the tormented Joanna Mills.  Gellar is filmed in harsh, unflattering light and spends much of the film looking confused (and rightfully so).  It turns out that the decision to frame her in such ashen tones was deliberate and, given the movie's twist, well-advised.  Not so smart was the decision to have her walk around in an ineffectual daze while she sees people who aren't there, revisits locales she's never seen before (?), and watches her eye color flicker from brown to blue.  Gellar's Joanna is hardly there at all.Also absent in the film are any elements of suspense or tension.  The story tries to use things like an aggressively lecherous coworker (the shrew-faced Adam Scott) and a repeated bar from Patsy Cline's ""Sweet Dreams"" to spur the suspense.  It's hard, though, to prickle the spine when a viewer has no idea what exactly they're supposed to be afraid of.Movies with the requisite twist only really work when the audience is led to believe something erroneous and then has that misconception yanked out from under them.  ""The Return"" leads you to believe nothing, asking instead that the well-executed ambience be enough reason to stick with the script's senselessness in the hopes that the pay-off will be enough to justify over an hour of quiet confusion.The pay-off, to be clear, is well-done.  It brings to the story a cohesiveness that is almost enjoyable.  It is the sort of ""Ohhhhh!"" moment that gives meaning to every mystifying element that came before it.  The story, in light of this, is well-written.But it is not well-done.  The movie is only good in retrospect, but not from front-to-back.  The presence of an always-excellent Sam Shepard and the excellent closure of the conclusion don't make up for the mind-numbing (and confusing) clap-trap that makes up 95% of the viewing experience.

Sarah Michelle Gellar was coming off the commercial successes of The Grudge and The Grudge 2, so I guess someone in The Return's marketing department decided &#8220;hey, we should come up with a poster that will draw the Grudge crowd&#8221;.  Bad idea. The movie was excoriated by the press (16% at Rotten Tomatoes critical) and the public (32% RT public, 4.8 at IMDB) alike. I...didn't think it was all that bad. It wasn't anything new, but we're talking about Hollywood here. What is?Kapadia (Senna) and screenwriter Adam Sussman, turning in his first feature, give us the story of Joanna Mills (Gellar), a saleswoman who heads back to rural Texas, where she grew up, to try and score some business for the shipping company she works for. When she gets back near where she grew up, she starts seeing things that are...out of the ordinary. We know from the opening scene, which takes place when Joanna is young, that she was emotionally unstable as a child thanks to a terrifying car accident, and we can assume the visions she sees have to do with that; she beings to put together the events of that night with some help from a local, Terry Stahl (X-Men Origins: Wolverine's Peter O'Brien), who is embroiled in a mystery of his own; the rest of the town he lives in believes he killed his wife Annie (Fast Food Nation's Erinn Allison). He proclaims his innocence. Hey, two mysteries are better than one&#8212;and the more Joanna is drawn into Terry's story, the more she begins to feel as if she were somehow related to it.Sure, it's contrived, and some of it is downright ridiculous, but it's not like you haven't seen this done worse dozens of times. (Hundreds, if you watch Lifetime or Hallmark.) You'll get a lot more out of it, I think, if you just dispense with the supernatural aspect of the movie altogether (that's the most contrived part) and just think of it as a straight mystery. It works that way, and it works well enough to kill and hour and a half with if you just want to turn your brain off and have a good time. Not timeless cinema by any means, but not as bad as you probably heard it was. ** ",3,The eyes have it.,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,2229,"['Return', 'Asif', 'Kapadia', '2006', 'Everyone', 'good', 'mystery', 'Unless', 'marketed', 'horror', 'film', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'was', 'coming', 'off', 'commercial', 'successes', 'Grudge', 'Grudge', '2', 'so', 'guess', 'someone', 'Return', 'marketing', 'department', 'decided', '8220', 'hey', 'should', 'come', 'up', 'poster', 'will', 'draw', 'Grudge', 'crowd', '8221', 'Bad', 'idea', 'movie', 'was', 'excoriated', 'press', '16', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'critical', 'public', '32', '%', 'RT', 'public', '4.8', 'IMDB', 'alike', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Hollywood', 'here', 'What', 'Kapadia', 'Senna', 'screenwriter', 'Adam', 'Sussman', 'turning', 'first', 'feature', 'give', 'story', 'Joanna', 'Mills', 'Gellar', 'saleswoman', 'who', 'back', 'rural', 'Texas', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'try', 'score', 'business', 'shipping', 'company', 'When', 'back', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'seeing', 'things', 'are', 'ordinary', 'know', 'opening', 'scene', 'place', 'when', 'Joanna', 'young', 'was', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'child', 'thanks', 'terrifying', 'car', 'accident', 'can', 'assume', 'visions', 'have', 'do', 'put', 'together', 'events', 'night', 'help', 'local', 'Terry', 'Stahl', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'Peter', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'embroiled', 'mystery', 'own', 'rest', 'town', 'killed', 'wife', 'Annie', 'Fast', 'Food', 'Nation', 'Erinn', 'Allison', 'innocence', 'Hey', 'two', 'mysteries', 'are', 'better', 'one', '8212', 'more', 'Joanna', 'drawn', 'Terry', 'story', 'more', 'feel', 'were', 'somehow', 'related', 'it.Sure', 'contrived', 'downright', 'ridiculous', 'not', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'done', 'worse', 'dozens', 'times', 'Hundreds', 'watch', 'Lifetime', 'Hallmark', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'think', 'just', 'dispense', 'supernatural', 'aspect', 'movie', 'altogether', 'most', 'contrived', 'part', 'just', 'think', 'straight', 'mystery', 'way', 'well', 'enough', 'kill', 'hour', 'half', 'just', 'want', 'turn', 'brain', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'Not', 'timeless', 'cinema', 'means', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'probably', 'heard', 'was', '**']",The Return

The girl is spooked by something, and her father mentions to one of the vendors that she hasn't been quite the same since the car crash...Fifteen years later the girl, Joanna, is grown and about to travel back to her hometown of LaSalle, Texas for the first time in years to close her first big sales deal.  She does so, but almost immediately after her arrival she begins suffering from migraines and nightmares, and periodically imagines herself in real places that she has never been.  She also finds herself inexplicably drawn to a man the other locals warn her is dangerous.THE RETURN struck me as having a decidedly eastern sensibility, because of both its nonlinear structure and its spiritual nature.  It also does not lay things out plainly for the viewer -- though neither is it as ambiguous as it might first seem.  I very much like films that make me think, even more if they keep me thinking about them after they are over.  What I don't like are films that string me along for eighty minutes without any idea of what's going on, or at least a feeling that it is building up to something.  A brief scene in which Joanna visits her father brings with it hope of some kind of clue, but it is over before we learn anything useful.  The truth about Joanna's condition is revealed in the last few minutes of the film, but the story doesn't appear to make any sense at all until that point.  I suspect the film would play better on a second viewing.  The first was frustrating and confusing, without being particularly interesting or involving.This movie will probably appeal most to fans of Asian cinema (of which I am one), especially the films of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, and I was also reminded of the Pang Brothers' EYE films at times.  There is a really good idea here, but it's not given enough substance to make a satisfying feature length picture.  Had it been about a half hour shorter and more tightly written, I think it would have been more effective.The DVD contains an eight-minute behind-the-scenes featurette, six deleted scenes, and a slightly different alternate ending.

The creepy big houses in the middle of nowhere were a bit Texas Chainsaw-like and I half expected Leatherface himself to tear out of the barn at any minute.

That fact alone is worth one star. On the positive side, the actors in this movie a very good. Gellar plays a salesperson who visits Texas and suddenly becomes overwhelmed with visions about a murdered woman. The spirit of this murdered woman seems to manifest itself within Gellar's visions.On the negative side, the movie fails to actually ""show"" the spirit. In addition, there are many unecessary long dull scenes which should not have been included in the movie. Director Asif Kapadia tries too much to build suspense but fails to ever ""shock"" the audience with any surprises during the movie. The DVD itself does offer some alternate scenes that were deleted and it also offers a rather interesting alternate ending.During most of this movie, the camera would languish and focus on the ground or a road for what seems to be minutes at a time. Then, nothing. No surprises, no shocks. This movie is very, very, dull.I believe the director tries to emulate some Japenese horror movies which tend to have a ""dream like"" setting, but, unfortunately, Asif Kapadia spends too much time shooting dull and boring camera angles and not nearly enough time shooting the exciting scenes that made Sarah Michelle Gellar popular in the first place.In conclusion, the actors are great.
