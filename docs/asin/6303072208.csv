354353,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303072208,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","When &#8216;Tribute to a Bad Man&#8217; first started, I was hesitant to finish it.  In the first few minutes it was apparent that the storyline was going to be very close to that of &#8216;Jubal&#8217;, and I hated that movie.  It is strange to me that both films were released in the same year and carry such similar premises.  &#8216;Jubal&#8217; failed just about everywhere except for Steiger&#8217;s performance, so I was expecting to loathe this, but for me it pretty much excels everywhere except Stephen McNally&#8217;s performance (which would be the equivalent of Steiger&#8217;s character), which surprised me a lot.Here we have an angrier protagonist, Jeremy Rodock, who runs his ranch with a jealous rage that masks over a much softer soul.  He lives with a beautiful Mexican woman, Jocasta, who is haunted by her past.  His main employee, McNulty, is lusting after Jocasta, but she rejects his advances.  In the film&#8217;s opening scene, Jeremy is saved by Steve, a young and inexperienced man looking for a job and a fresh start.  He&#8217;s a fast learner, but is soon soured by Jeremy&#8217;s &#8216;hanging fever&#8217; and his own growing love for Jocasta.The film is beautifully shot, and while Cagney is a tad miscast (I would have loved for Spencer Tracy to have kept on with this one), Irene Papas is marvelous here, and the tone of the film is perfectly sustained.  It&#8217;s like an angrier &#8216;Jubal&#8217; with much better direction.",4,Not what I was expecting&#8230;,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,1467,"['When', '8216', 'Tribute', 'Bad', 'Man', '8217', 'first', 'started', 'was', 'hesitant', 'finish', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'was', 'apparent', 'storyline', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'close', '8216', 'Jubal', '8217', 'hated', 'movie', 'strange', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'carry', 'such', 'similar', 'premises', '8216', 'Jubal', '8217', 'failed', 'just', 'everywhere', 'Steiger', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'was', 'expecting', 'loathe', 'pretty', 'much', 'excels', 'everywhere', 'Stephen', 'McNally', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'equivalent', 'Steiger', '8217', 'character', 'surprised', 'lot.Here', 'have', 'angrier', 'protagonist', 'Jeremy', 'Rodock', 'who', 'ranch', 'jealous', 'rage', 'much', 'softer', 'soul', 'beautiful', 'Mexican', 'woman', 'Jocasta', 'who', 'haunted', 'past', 'main', 'employee', 'McNulty', 'lusting', 'Jocasta', 'advances', 'film', '8217', 'opening', 'scene', 'Jeremy', 'saved', 'Steve', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'man', 'looking', 'job', 'fresh', 'start', '8217', 'fast', 'learner', 'soon', 'soured', 'Jeremy', '8217', '8216', 'hanging', 'fever', '8217', 'own', 'growing', 'love', 'Jocasta.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Cagney', 'tad', 'miscast', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'have', 'kept', 'one', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'marvelous', 'here', 'tone', 'film', 'perfectly', 'sustained', '8217', 'angrier', '8216', 'Jubal', '8217', 'much', 'better', 'direction']",Tribute to a Bad Man VHS
354354,A16R3RWR3U3FWQ,6303072208,"c.g. gilman ""count""","[5, 5]","Admittedly ""Tribute to a Badman"" is not a great film, but it showcases Cagney the golden age actor. The movie was originally intended as a Spencer Tracy vehicle, but Tracy was nearing the end of his career at MGM and bowed out. Cagney took over the role as an act of friendship. Quite frankly the film works better as a Cagney western than it would a Tracy oater. For one thing there is no stunt double in Cagneys big fight scene with Stephen McNally. Both men square off one on one with Cagney besting the younger McNally. An older looking Tracy would have used an unconvincing double. Although Tracy was one year younger than Cagney he looked 10 years older. Smoking and hard drinking had taken their toll on Spencer. The love scenes between Tracy and Irene Papas (in her american film debut) would not have seemed real because of this.  At best Tacy would come off as a sugar daddy. With Cagney in the lead it works because we can believe she is attracted to this tough no nonsense middle aged man. His scenes with her are touching and sensitive. We feel Cagney's pain when she momentarily runs off with the much younger Don Dubbins, and understand his jealousy in wanting to keep her away from the ranch hands that work for him. As his charcter Jeremy Rodock says "" A man turns his back and they steal anything. A horse, a woman"". Incidentally Cagney loves his horses almost as much as he loves Irene. He hangs anyone who tries to steal them. In fact the horse he rides is one that he bred and raised in real life. In the role of Jocasta Irene Papas is tough, sexy and feisty. She proves she knows how to deal with any man,even Cagney. It is an excellent portrayal. For cinephiles this movie is chockfull of character actors including Lee Van Cleef, Royal Dano, James Griffith, Onslow Stevens(as a scurvy murdering horse thief) Jeanette Nolan and a young hot headed Vic Morrow. The disc quality is excellent and the Eastman technicolor in the movie is breathtaking thanks to the beautiful cinematography by Robert Surtees. The score by Miklos Rozsa is stirring and sweeping. The sterophonic sound is great. You will hear the sound of ricocheting bullets bouncing from speaker to speaker. Robert Wises smooth direction keeps the film flowing, but it is Cagney's bravura performance that keeps the viewer riveted to the screen. The disc also contains the trailer which shows Cagney on his farm at the begining and also has in it an unintentionally funny line. So saddle up pardner to a well deserved tribute.",4,Tribute to a Great Actor,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2510,"['Admittedly', 'Tribute', 'Badman', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'Cagney', 'golden', 'age', 'actor', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'vehicle', 'Tracy', 'was', 'nearing', 'end', 'career', 'MGM', 'bowed', 'out', 'Cagney', 'took', 'over', 'role', 'act', 'friendship', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'film', 'better', 'Cagney', 'western', 'would', 'Tracy', 'oater', 'one', 'thing', 'stunt', 'double', 'Cagneys', 'big', 'fight', 'scene', 'Stephen', 'McNally', 'men', 'square', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'Cagney', 'besting', 'younger', 'McNally', 'older', 'looking', 'Tracy', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'unconvincing', 'double', 'Tracy', 'was', 'one', 'year', 'younger', 'Cagney', 'looked', '10', 'years', 'older', 'Smoking', 'hard', 'drinking', 'had', 'taken', 'toll', 'Spencer', 'love', 'scenes', 'Tracy', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'american', 'film', 'debut', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seemed', 'real', 'best', 'Tacy', 'would', 'come', 'off', 'sugar', 'daddy', 'Cagney', 'lead', 'can', 'believe', 'attracted', 'tough', 'nonsense', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'scenes', 'are', 'touching', 'sensitive', 'feel', 'Cagney', 'pain', 'when', 'momentarily', 'much', 'younger', 'Don', 'Dubbins', 'understand', 'jealousy', 'wanting', 'keep', 'away', 'ranch', 'work', 'charcter', 'Jeremy', 'Rodock', 'A', 'man', 'back', 'steal', 'anything', 'horse', 'woman', 'Incidentally', 'Cagney', 'horses', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'Irene', 'anyone', 'who', 'steal', 'fact', 'horse', 'one', 'bred', 'raised', 'real', 'life', 'role', 'Jocasta', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'tough', 'sexy', 'feisty', 'how', 'deal', 'man', 'even', 'Cagney', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'cinephiles', 'movie', 'chockfull', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'Royal', 'Dano', 'James', 'Griffith', 'Onslow', 'Stevens', 'scurvy', 'murdering', 'horse', 'thief', 'Jeanette', 'Nolan', 'young', 'hot', 'headed', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'disc', 'quality', 'excellent', 'Eastman', 'technicolor', 'movie', 'breathtaking', 'thanks', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Robert', 'Surtees', 'score', 'Miklos', 'Rozsa', 'stirring', 'sweeping', 'sterophonic', 'sound', 'great', 'will', 'hear', 'sound', 'ricocheting', 'bullets', 'bouncing', 'speaker', 'speaker', 'Robert', 'Wises', 'smooth', 'direction', 'film', 'flowing', 'Cagney', 'bravura', 'performance', 'viewer', 'riveted', 'screen', 'disc', 'also', 'trailer', 'Cagney', 'farm', 'begining', 'also', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'line', 'So', 'saddle', 'up', 'pardner', 'well', 'deserved', 'tribute']",Tribute to a Bad Man VHS
354355,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6303072208,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 3]","""Tribute to a Bad Man"" is a 1956 western starring Jimmy Cagney and directed by Robert Wise. Irene Papas, Vic Morrow, Lee Van Cleef and Jeanette Nolan co-star.Jimmy Cagney (1899-1986) was one of the biggest stars of the 30s and 40s, was nominated for an Oscar for his work in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (1938) and won for his 1942 portrayal of George M Cohan in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"". While he's best known for his gangster roles, the majority of Cagney's screen appearances were not as a gangster - he played  an insurance salesman (""The Millionaire"", 1931), an engineer (""Other Men's Women"", 1931),  a boxer (""Winner Take All"", 1932), an auto racer (""The Crowd Roars"", 1932), a Broadway producer (""Footlight Parade"", 1933), etc. Indeed, Cagney often appeared in comedies (e.g., ""Here Comes the Navy"",  ""Hard to Handle"", ""Jimmy the Gent""), although it was his gangster films that earned the really big bucks. Here in 1956 his best days were behind him, his  penultimate salute to the gangster films (""White Heat"" in 1949) had been made, and he was only a few years away from retirement (""One Two Three"" in 1961).BTW - This was not Cagney's only western. He did ""The Oklahoma Kid"" (1939) which was clearly one of his worst films ever. The only saving grace for Cagney is that Bogart was even worse in the film, causing Bogart to never make another western.Irene Papas (1926 -) plays Cagney's love interest in her film debut. Papas appeared in more than 80 films between 1948 and 2003, including ""The Guns of Navarone"" (1961), ""Zorba the Greek"" (1964), and ""The Trojan Women"" (1971).You'll remember Vic Morrow (1929-82) best from the TV series ""Combat"" (1962-7) for which he was Emmy nominated, and while he did most of his work on TV, he was in several memorable movies including his debut in ""Blackboard Jungle"" (1955) and ""God's Little Acre"" (1958). Morrow was killed while filming an episode of Twilight Zone in 1982. Morrow plays the son of Cagney's ex-partner.Lee Van Cleef (1925-89) is everyone's favorite bandit as a result of films like ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965) and ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" (1966). Cleef appeared in more than 150 films, many of them westerns (""High Noon"", ""Gunfight at OK Corral"", ""Return of Sabata""). Van Cleef plays one of Cagney's ranch hands.Jeanette Nolan (1911-98) made her film debut as Lady Macbeth in Orson Welles' 1948 film. She made nearly 100 films and played in nearly as many TV shows, earning 4 Emmy nominations. Her last appearance was in 1998 as Robert Redford's mother in ""The Horse Whisperer"".  Nolan plays the wife of Cagney's ex-partner.Stephen McNally (1913-1994) was a staple in over 50 films including ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" (1944), ""Johnny Belinda"" (1948), and ""Winchester 73"". In the 50s he turned his attention to TV where he was active as a guest star and a regular (""Run for Your Life"", ""Police Story""). McNally plays a member of Cagney's ranch hands.Robert Wise (1914-2005) directs. Wise is best known from the Oscar winning musicals ""West Side Story"" (1961) and ""Sound of Music"" (1965). He worked as a film editor for Orson Welles on ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942) and while Welles was overseas Wise reduced it to 88 minutes. Welles said it had been edited ""by a lawnmower"". Wise got the chance to shoot several new scenes for the film, and this helped launch his career from editor to director. His first film as a director was the much over-rated ""The Curse of the Cat People"" (1944) which actually used the sets from ""Ambersons"". He continued to make unremarkable films until 1951 when he scored with ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"".In 1956 viewers were lured by the blockbusters - ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Around the World in 80 days"", ""War and Peace"", and ""The King and I"" were the box office favorites. The Oscars went to ""Giant"" (Director), ""Anastasia"" (Actress), and ""Lust for Life"" (Supporting Actor). Other notable films that year included ""The Searchers"", ""Baby Doll"", ""The Rainmaker"",  and ""Bus Stop"".All things considered this is standard B western stuff. There is no great action and no great story. It is entirely watchable but not particularly interesting, informative, or provocative.",3,B western,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,4181,"['Tribute', 'Bad', 'Man', '1956', 'western', 'starring', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'Irene', 'Papas', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'Jeanette', 'Nolan', 'co-star.Jimmy', 'Cagney', '1899-1986', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'stars', '30s', '40s', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'work', 'Angels', 'Dirty', 'Faces', '1938', 'won', '1942', 'portrayal', 'George', 'M', 'Cohan', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'best', 'known', 'gangster', 'roles', 'majority', 'Cagney', 'screen', 'appearances', 'were', 'not', 'gangster', 'played', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'Millionaire', '1931', 'engineer', 'Other', 'Men', 'Women', '1931', 'boxer', 'Winner', 'Take', '1932', 'auto', 'racer', 'Crowd', 'Roars', '1932', 'Broadway', 'producer', 'Footlight', 'Parade', '1933', 'etc', 'Indeed', 'Cagney', 'often', 'appeared', 'comedies', 'e.g.', 'Here', 'Navy', 'Hard', 'Handle', 'Jimmy', 'Gent', 'was', 'gangster', 'films', 'earned', 'really', 'big', 'bucks', 'Here', '1956', 'best', 'days', 'were', 'penultimate', 'salute', 'gangster', 'films', 'White', 'Heat', '1949', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'away', 'retirement', 'One', 'Two', 'Three', '1961', '.BTW', 'was', 'not', 'Cagney', 'only', 'western', 'did', 'Oklahoma', 'Kid', '1939', 'was', 'clearly', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'Cagney', 'Bogart', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'film', 'causing', 'Bogart', 'never', 'make', 'western.Irene', 'Papas', '1926', 'Cagney', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'debut', 'Papas', 'appeared', 'more', '80', 'films', '1948', '2003', 'including', 'Guns', 'Navarone', '1961', 'Zorba', 'Greek', '1964', 'Trojan', 'Women', '1971', '.You', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'Vic', 'Morrow', '1929-82', 'best', 'TV', 'series', 'Combat', '1962-7', 'was', 'Emmy', 'nominated', 'did', 'most', 'work', 'TV', 'was', 'several', 'memorable', 'movies', 'including', 'debut', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', '1955', 'God', 'Little', 'Acre', '1958', 'Morrow', 'was', 'killed', 'filming', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '1982', 'Morrow', 'son', 'Cagney', 'ex-partner.Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', '1925-89', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'bandit', 'result', 'films', 'Few', 'Dollars', 'More', '1965', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', '1966', 'Cleef', 'appeared', 'more', '150', 'films', 'many', 'westerns', 'High', 'Noon', 'Gunfight', 'OK', 'Corral', 'Return', 'Sabata', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'one', 'Cagney', 'ranch', 'hands.Jeanette', 'Nolan', '1911-98', 'made', 'film', 'debut', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'Orson', 'Welles', '1948', 'film', 'made', 'nearly', '100', 'films', 'played', 'nearly', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'earning', '4', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'last', 'appearance', 'was', '1998', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'mother', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'Nolan', 'wife', 'Cagney', 'ex-partner.Stephen', 'McNally', '1913-1994', 'was', 'staple', '50', 'films', 'including', 'Thirty', 'Seconds', 'Tokyo', '1944', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', '1948', 'Winchester', '73', '50s', 'turned', 'attention', 'TV', 'where', 'was', 'active', 'guest', 'star', 'regular', 'Run', 'Life', 'Police', 'Story', 'McNally', 'member', 'Cagney', 'ranch', 'hands.Robert', 'Wise', '1914-2005', 'directs', 'Wise', 'best', 'known', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'musicals', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', '1961', 'Sound', 'Music', '1965', 'worked', 'film', 'editor', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', '1942', 'Welles', 'was', 'overseas', 'Wise', 'reduced', '88', 'minutes', 'Welles', 'said', 'had', 'been', 'edited', 'lawnmower', 'Wise', 'got', 'chance', 'shoot', 'several', 'new', 'scenes', 'film', 'helped', 'launch', 'career', 'editor', 'director', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'was', 'much', 'over-rated', 'Curse', 'Cat', 'People', '1944', 'actually', 'used', 'sets', 'Ambersons', 'continued', 'make', 'unremarkable', 'films', '1951', 'when', 'scored', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', '.In', '1956', 'viewers', 'were', 'lured', 'blockbusters', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'World', '80', 'days', 'War', 'Peace', 'King', 'were', 'box', 'office', 'favorites', 'Oscars', 'went', 'Giant', 'Director', 'Anastasia', 'Actress', 'Lust', 'Life', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Other', 'notable', 'films', 'year', 'included', 'Searchers', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'Rainmaker', 'Bus', 'Stop', '.All', 'things', 'considered', 'standard', 'B', 'western', 'stuff', 'great', 'action', 'great', 'story', 'entirely', 'watchable', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'informative', 'provocative']",Tribute to a Bad Man VHS
