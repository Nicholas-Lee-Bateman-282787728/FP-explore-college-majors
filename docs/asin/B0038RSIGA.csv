(Learning some Shakespeare is on my bucket list, reading it is pretty heavy going so I've cheated and resorted to Shakespeare movie productions.)  David Tennant (the last Dr. Who) is a favorite and does a really strange, imaginative  and entertaining job of interpreting Hamlet for us.  My next step is to put on my tape of Olivier's version and compare the two - I'm sure I'll end up greatly preferring the Tennant version.

I especially like the way the queen, Polonius, Ophelia, and Laertes are played.The setting is contemporary, and makes heavy use of reflections and CCTV images as symbols.  I very much enjoyed the director's vision, but like all modern tellings of Shakespeare, there is a place or two in the text that refuses to stretch convincingly to the present day equivalent.I loved the production.  Why did I not give it a full five stars?  Nit-picky things.  For example, I thought the delivery of the ""To be or not to be"" speech was too much whispered, and too hard for my middle-aged ears to follow.  I would have liked it to be more crisp.  And I hated the T-shirt he was wearing when he gave the speech.  I thought that was far too casual for the Prince of Denmark in a public room of the palace.Is this my favorite Hamlet?

The sets were amazing, the acting especially by David Tennant and Sir Patrick Stewart was brilliant. David Tennant's performance was nothing less than extraordinary, and if you don't believe me, then believe Sir Patrick Stewart who stated in interviews that David was the finest and most talented young actor in England today. David brings the tortured soul of Hamlet to life. He runs the gambit of emotions from deep depression over his father's death to anger over the too quick marriage of his mother to his uncle - to revenge for his fathers murder by his uncle, to self pity and self doubt.  David was very capable of the pretense of madness by Hamlet in front of the king, queen, and court while he plots his revenge.Other reviewers have not understood the use of the surveillance cameras, but this is to show how everyone was always under watch by the King or his men, using the cameras or hidden rooms to spy on all.  At one point Tennant breaks a camera and states ""Now I am alone"". Plus the use of camera's and modern clothing, and the use of a helicopter by the Norwegian army against Poland give the audience of today a better understanding of Shakespeare and grounding in today's society. And what's the difference of what costume is worn as long as those beautiful words of the Bard are used, they are the important thing.I thought the supporting actors who played Laretes, Horatio, and Gertrude were great, but I thought the actors who portrayed Ophelia and Polonius were a little too one dimensional.Anyone thinking of buying this movie, will more that get their money's worth.

Now that Old Hamlet is dead, Young Fortinbras wants his land back and is willing to take it by force. Meanwhile back in D&auml;nemark Young Hamlet who is excessively grieving for the loss of his father, gets a now insight from his father&#8217;s ghost.

Marold""","[0, 0]","I confess that when I first viewed this DVD, seeing perhaps the first two scenes before falling asleep, I was not especially impressed, because Tennant's initial surly Hamlet seemed to be just a petulant kid in comparison to the likes of Branagh, Burton, and Olivier. But that's the point, and that's the genius of this production. Here, we finally have an actor who can convincingly look and act the age of Hamlet, who has barely reached the age of 21 and still a college student. After he meets the spirit on the battlements, Tennant reaches his stride. In fact, the scene where he meets the specter of his father (played by Patrick Steward, who also plays his uncle) is done for the first time in such a way as we understand the charge given by the specter to Hamlet.This is a benefit of the fact that I believe this production has almost every word Shakespeare wrote. The full Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern subplot is here, and we get the fullest sense of the air that all of the Danish royal family have become unstuck from reality, and time and space are not what they should be. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where Hamlet's make believe madness turns into real madness. It may be when he kills Polonius, and thinks little of it, while acting entirely inappropriately towards his mother. The clue there is that is when he first breaks a mirror.The modern (or at least early 20th century) setting does not put off one bit. In fact, one of the few inventive pieces of business which take advantage of this is that Hamlet kills Polonius with a revolver rather than with a sword or dagger. His sword is also replaced by a rather lethal looking switch blade.Aside from Tennant and Stewart, there are no famous names and faces in the cast; however, all carry their parts quite well. One of the delights, as usual, is the business carried out by the visiting troupe of actors. Unlike some productions, the pantomime scene is included, before the full ""Murder of Gonzago"" is presented with Hamlet's added speech. Two scenes which seem to come off with less force is the gravedigger scene and the final fencing scene. Other productions have had brilliant comedians play the gravedigger. This actor was merely competent (although the business with which it was done had some very droll touches. I must note that Mariah Gale did an interpretation which is totally different from the frail, dutiful daughter done by Jean Simmons in Olivier's production or the freer and more limber Kate Winslet in Branagh's production. One might almost consider her a tom boy.The director, Gregory Doran earned his pay with this production. The sense of something being rotten in Denmark starts early and builds to the famous murderous climax.The setting is perfect as a modern royal castle of a smaller royal family. It has none of the over the top expanse of Branagh and the gloomy ill lit damp rooms by Olivier.",5,The new standard for Hamlet,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,2892,"['confess', 'when', 'first', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'perhaps', 'first', 'two', 'scenes', 'falling', 'asleep', 'was', 'not', 'especially', 'impressed', 'Tennant', 'initial', 'surly', 'Hamlet', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'petulant', 'kid', 'comparison', 'likes', 'Branagh', 'Burton', 'Olivier', 'point', 'genius', 'production', 'Here', 'finally', 'have', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'convincingly', 'look', 'act', 'age', 'Hamlet', 'who', 'barely', 'reached', 'age', '21', 'still', 'college', 'student', 'spirit', 'battlements', 'Tennant', 'stride', 'fact', 'scene', 'where', 'specter', 'father', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Steward', 'who', 'also', 'uncle', 'done', 'first', 'time', 'such', 'way', 'understand', 'charge', 'given', 'specter', 'Hamlet.This', 'benefit', 'fact', 'believe', 'production', 'almost', 'word', 'Shakespeare', 'wrote', 'full', 'Rosenkrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'subplot', 'here', 'get', 'fullest', 'sense', 'air', 'Danish', 'royal', 'family', 'have', 'become', 'unstuck', 'reality', 'time', 'space', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'exactly', 'where', 'Hamlet', 'make', 'believe', 'madness', 'real', 'madness', 'may', 'be', 'when', 'Polonius', 'little', 'acting', 'entirely', 'inappropriately', 'mother', 'clue', 'when', 'first', 'mirror.The', 'modern', 'least', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'setting', 'not', 'put', 'off', 'one', 'bit', 'fact', 'one', 'few', 'inventive', 'pieces', 'business', 'take', 'advantage', 'Hamlet', 'Polonius', 'revolver', 'rather', 'sword', 'dagger', 'sword', 'also', 'replaced', 'rather', 'lethal', 'looking', 'switch', 'blade.Aside', 'Tennant', 'Stewart', 'are', 'famous', 'names', 'cast', 'however', 'carry', 'parts', 'quite', 'well', 'One', 'delights', 'usual', 'business', 'carried', 'out', 'visiting', 'troupe', 'actors', 'productions', 'pantomime', 'scene', 'included', 'full', 'Murder', 'Gonzago', 'presented', 'Hamlet', 'added', 'speech', 'Two', 'scenes', 'seem', 'come', 'off', 'less', 'force', 'gravedigger', 'scene', 'final', 'fencing', 'scene', 'Other', 'productions', 'have', 'had', 'brilliant', 'comedians', 'play', 'gravedigger', 'actor', 'was', 'merely', 'competent', 'business', 'was', 'done', 'had', 'very', 'droll', 'touches', 'must', 'note', 'Mariah', 'Gale', 'did', 'interpretation', 'totally', 'different', 'frail', 'dutiful', 'daughter', 'done', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Olivier', 'production', 'freer', 'more', 'limber', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Branagh', 'production', 'One', 'might', 'almost', 'consider', 'tom', 'boy.The', 'director', 'Gregory', 'Doran', 'earned', 'pay', 'production', 'sense', 'something', 'being', 'rotten', 'Denmark', 'early', 'builds', 'famous', 'murderous', 'climax.The', 'setting', 'perfect', 'modern', 'royal', 'castle', 'smaller', 'royal', 'family', 'none', 'top', 'expanse', 'Branagh', 'gloomy', 'ill', 'lit', 'damp', 'rooms', 'Olivier']",N/A

Mel was flawless in presenting each soliloquy - it was like moving from one mesmerizing vignette to another.  Tennant, however, brings the tale of Hamlet to life in a shocking, very emotionally deep and present way.  It truly is as if we are both seeing and hearing the deepest thoughts of this famous Shakespearean hero/victim.  This type of acting is definitely where David Tennant excels!  In an interview with David, he admitted that it was a role that he had always felt compelled to do because it was so confronting and challenging.  He also said he could never do it again, shaking his head reaffirmingly to hiimself, because (quoting David Tennant) ""that way... madness lies.""  This gives serious insight into how much Tennant gave of himself to the role and how deeply it affected him as a result.Patrick Stewart did a wonderful job as Hamlet's uncle, and I truly ended up detesting him because he was so good at his portrayal - so much so, that I felt badly afterward because I rather like Patrick Stewart for some of the charity work he has done.  It just goes to show what a wonderful actor he is and how surprisingly good he is, even at playing the villain!In addition to the wonderful performances given by both Tennant, Stewart, and others from the supporting cast, the directing was just a phenomenal re-envisioning of this classic, and yet deeply reflective version of the ""revenge play,"" that was so popular during Shakespeare's time.  Rather than making a mere mockery of the unabashed sanguinary nature of the Elizabethan revenge play, Shakespeare creates in Hamlet a hero who struggles against the act of vengeance, with a much more deep and serious  irony, that he seems incontrovertibly fated to perform.  Hamlet is reluctant, and does not want the burden foisted upon him by the code of honor to which he feels so dutifully bound and yet wishes to be freed from.  In David Tennant's performance, through the lens of both director and actor, we see, feel and experience, with dynamic movement, the genius of the story that is Hamlet as it unfolds both before us, boldly, sharply, confrontingly..",5,Fresh Hamlet!

The mirrors, as in the Branagh version, are a nice metaphorical touch.Patrick Stewart plays a very human and pitiable king, John Woodvine was superb as the player king, and the rest of the cast very good.

1333113,AHJF1J9I4LYVR,B0038RSIGA,Drektath,"[3, 3]","Well, let's start with the positives first (in order of importance):--First, the the heart of it all. David Tennant is delightful as Hamlet. It's a 4-star performance easily, possibly even a 5-star performance. Tennant played 3 series as a mad man with a box. Well, here he is playing a mad man (or is he?) without a box and it is just as entertaining. Purists may not like the extremes to which Tennant takes Hamlet's madness (calculated or not), but it is a wonderfully refreshing performance.--Audio is crisp and clear.--Production values are high.And now the negatives (in order of importance):--Final scene with Fortinbras discovering the wreckage of the Danish court is omitted. Not only does this leave the production ending on an odd note, but it renders all of the allusions to Fortinbras superfluous.--This production attempts to ""modernize"" Hamlet to the present day (or at least something not far off from it--guns, video cameras, and casual t-shirt and jeans dress are present). That's not a bad thing in and of itself. But the attempt is half-hearted and uneven, serving more as a distraction and source of potential confusion than anything else.--Patrick Stewart's performance as Claudius is remarkably different from the one in Branagh's production. It isn't bad, it isn't wooden, it's just very subdued.

1333114,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0038RSIGA,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[171, 183]","""Hamlet"" doesn't need any introduction -- the tortured Dane, the ghost, meditations on suicide and a climax full of death. But while many adaptations of Shakespeare's classic play feel stuffy and distant, this ""Hamlet"" has it all -- sleek elegant sets, powerful acting, and clever modern twists on the age-old stuff. And the best part is the brilliant performances by David Tennant and Patrick Stewart.Prince Hamlet of Denmark (Tennant) is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude (Penny Downie) marries his uncle Claudius (Stewart). But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (Stewart again), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia (Mariah Gale), arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon (yodeling with a fake crown?). But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy, Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too...""Hamlet"" is one of those plays that only really comes out two ways -- either you have a passionate, intense tragedy full of very human characters, or you have two boring hours of some whiny guy talking to himself. Having suffered through the latter in the past, it makes me appreciate a well-done performance all the more -- and this ""Hamlet"" is full of energy, vitality and wit.A lot of that comes from Tennant, who is simply brilliant as Hamlet -- loads of energy, and a weird edge to his ""madness"" (example: freaking out Polonius by pulling a weird face). And he runs the entire emotional gamut here -- love, pain, puckish comedy, loathing, sorrow and shock, with the absolute peak being the hauntingly sad ""to be or not to be"" scene.And Patrick Stewart is casually brilliant in his double role -- Claudius seems like a genial guy, but Stewart lets out little hints of his true nastiness; on the other hand, the ghost is all heavy intensity. Downie is excellent as Gertrude, and Gale is rather flat in her first few scenes, but after Ophelia goes mad she's amazing. Ripping off her clothes, leaping around, smacking Gertrude -- it's frighteningly good.And the settings and costumes are similarly amazing. The entire play is done in a sleek, elegant modern style (""mad"" Hamlet runs around in jeans), but the grandeur of a royal court is still there -- lots of elaborate formal clothes, and a looming, columned black palace-stage. There are some clever modern twists (Polonius spies through a one-way mirror and security cameras), and there are some truly brilliant bits of symbolism sprinkled through the story (Gertrude seeing the mad Ophelia in a shattered mirror).This adaptation of ""Hamlet"" is a solid piece of work, with the smooth feeling of a classic play done by insanely talented people.

Unfortunatly the production of this film cannot seem to shake it's stage roots, making it a sometimes awkward experience.This version of Hamlet (as you probably know) updates the tale to modern day times with a bit of cold-war mentality mixed in. The use of 'black and white' security footage is a nice homage to old thrillers giving it a cold, isolated atmosphere and the feeling of paranoia between chracters comes off quite well in this story. Unfortunately the director decided to keep the camera stationary throughout most of the scenes eliminating any personal connection you have with the setting and characters. The close-ups look great as do the more enclosed scenes (the 'mouse-trap' performance scene was great and the later outside shots in the snow were surprisingly realized) but with bigger sets the movie looks stagey and unauthentic (the opening with the ghost looked too silly to be taken seriously).The one consistantly good thing about this movie version of Hamlet is it's acting. David Tennant is VERY impressive as the title character (with not a hint of Dr. Who, even in Hamlet's more humorous scenes) and his performance is really something to see! Patrick Stewart is equally excellent as Claudius. Mariah Gale plays a more laid-back, reserved Ophelia but I quite liked her performance (her break-down scenes are terrific!). In fact the whole cast is perfectly in character and really do comendable jobs. It's really a shame the sometimes boring camera work (which I mentioned above) makes a lot of the more emotional scenes look cheesy and awkward. Surprisingly, though the characters addressing the camera didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.As I've said, the performances and updating of Hamlet are absoluely stunning and would make for a terrific theater production!

The first film version I saw was the Olivier which I absolutely hated. It was all too artsy schmartsy for me and Olivier, as great as he is said to have been, always seemed to be acting. The next production was the Richard Burton on stage in New York. Good but just missing memorable in my opinion. Then followed an off-Broadway 60's version with Martin Sheen that was, well, of its time. (An example; in the fight scene at the end, a cannon is brought onto the stage and set off hitting Laertes with a cannon ball, to which Osric says, ""A hit! A very palpable hit!""

There followed many others including the Mel Gibson, Ethan Hawke and Kenneth Branagh film versions, the latter being the best version of the play I had seen...until now.The David Tennant/ Patrick Stewart RSC production for the BBC blows away every other HAMLET I have ever seen.

I was ready to scoff as I had just seen Tennant in the new version of FRIGHT NIGHT and, though he was hilarious and very good in that, I never thought he could pull off Hamlet.  He did, in spades. Antic in one scene, funereal in another, frightening in yet another (he sometimes conjured up Tony Perkins as Norman Bates in PSYCHO) the man was absolutely superb.

1333127,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B0038RSIGA,Joseph M. Reninger,"[6, 6]","Arguably the most famous play in English, Hamlet has been adapted for the movies and television innumerable times. I had a professor who said ""Eternal problems are always contemporary."" Similarly, great plays always have something to say to each new generation. The Royal Shakespeare Company of London has made a television version of its smash hit production of Hamlet starring David Tennant and Patrick Stewart.The good thing about a movie/tv production of a play is that the actors don't have to play to the very last row of the house and people in the last row (or in obstructed seating) can see all the detail and the action going on. The camera makes greater intimacy possible between the performers and the audience, while separating both in space and time.Speaking of space and time, you'd think I'd comment about Captain Picard and Doctor Who crossing over in medieval Denmark. Thankfully, this isn't that sort of adaptation. The setting is not medieval; Elsinore Castle is more modern with security cameras and large mirrors everywhere. Many characters have hand guns in addition to their swords (can't have Hamlet without swords, can you?). It's an odd blend of contemporary and historical set dressing and costuming meant to evoke a timeless quality.Tennant give a frenetic performance as Hamlet. At some points, he does look totally bonkers. This is no dour, Olivier performance. Tennant is convincing and doesn't go over the top, in the same way as Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight keep from going too far. Such performances are easy to parody because they come so close to overdoing it. Tennant balances the madness and the cunning of Hamlet quite well.Stewart as Claudius give a more subdued performance. This viewing is the first time I thought Claudius was a bit of an idiot at the beginning. Stewart has him bumbling a little bit. After the mock play in which he sees for the first time in an objective way how he killed his brother, he realizes the evil he's done but can't quite repent of it. He makes a believable turn into a more crafty schemer. He is more in control of the situation than he lets on, sending Hamlet to England or poisoning the cup. Stewart balances the evil and the cunning of Claudius quite well.Stewart also plays the Ghost of Hamlet's father. It's an interesting choice, suggesting Hamlet's disparaging comparisons between his father and his uncle might be more exaggerated than accurate. The choice provides a lot of food for thought about the characters.Unfortunately, Tennant and Stewart shine so much that the other actors are underwhelming by comparison. Gertrude and Ophelia are both competent but not exceptional. Ophelia's mad rant, singing and giving out flowers, seems flat and forced compared to Tennant easygoing frenzy. Polonius and Horatio are okay but unremarkable. Surprisingly, Mark Hadfield as the gravedigger comes off as an equal of Tennant. That actor should have been bumped up to Polonius's role.Many elements of the setting are used to emphasize various themes. The use of surveillance cameras (or ""CCTV"" as they are often referred to here in the UK) is a little odd. Snippets of scenes are shown as surveillance footage. At one point, Hamlet tears out one of the cameras and says, ""Now I am alone."" Spying and deception (and the damage they cause) are more critical elements to the story than I had considered before.Another element is the use of mirrors. Claudius and Polonius spy on Hamlet and Ophelia's conversation through a one-way mirror. When Hamlet kills Polonius, he shoots him through a mirrored door. From that point, almost everyone sees themselves in shattered reflections, showing the damage that so much deceit as done to them. It's an interesting device that isn't overplayed.Taken as a whole, this film version is definitely worth viewing. Many thought provoking ideas are brought out of the play that I hadn't seen or delved deeply before. Tennant's performance will surely be considered a classic portrayal of the mad Dane.",4,"Modernized well, nearly flawless adaptation",1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,4058,"['Arguably', 'most', 'famous', 'play', 'English', 'Hamlet', 'been', 'adapted', 'movies', 'television', 'innumerable', 'times', 'had', 'professor', 'who', 'said', 'Eternal', 'problems', 'are', 'always', 'contemporary', 'Similarly', 'great', 'plays', 'always', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'new', 'generation', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'London', 'made', 'television', 'version', 'smash', 'hit', 'production', 'Hamlet', 'starring', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Patrick', 'Stewart.The', 'good', 'thing', 'movie/tv', 'production', 'play', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'play', 'very', 'last', 'row', 'house', 'people', 'last', 'row', 'obstructed', 'seating', 'can', 'see', 'detail', 'action', 'going', 'camera', 'greater', 'intimacy', 'possible', 'performers', 'audience', 'separating', 'space', 'time.Speaking', 'space', 'time', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'comment', 'about', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'crossing', 'over', 'medieval', 'Denmark', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'sort', 'adaptation', 'setting', 'not', 'medieval', 'Elsinore', 'Castle', 'more', 'modern', 'security', 'cameras', 'large', 'mirrors', 'everywhere', 'Many', 'characters', 'have', 'hand', 'guns', 'addition', 'swords', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hamlet', 'swords', 'can', 'odd', 'blend', 'contemporary', 'historical', 'set', 'dressing', 'costuming', 'meant', 'evoke', 'timeless', 'quality.Tennant', 'give', 'frenetic', 'performance', 'Hamlet', 'points', 'look', 'totally', 'bonkers', 'dour', 'Olivier', 'performance', 'Tennant', 'convincing', ""n't"", 'go', 'top', 'same', 'way', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'keep', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'Such', 'performances', 'are', 'easy', 'parody', 'come', 'so', 'close', 'overdoing', 'Tennant', 'madness', 'cunning', 'Hamlet', 'quite', 'well.Stewart', 'Claudius', 'give', 'more', 'subdued', 'performance', 'viewing', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'Claudius', 'was', 'bit', 'idiot', 'beginning', 'Stewart', 'bumbling', 'little', 'bit', 'mock', 'play', 'first', 'time', 'objective', 'way', 'how', 'killed', 'brother', 'evil', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'repent', 'believable', 'turn', 'more', 'crafty', 'schemer', 'more', 'control', 'situation', 'sending', 'Hamlet', 'England', 'poisoning', 'cup', 'Stewart', 'evil', 'cunning', 'Claudius', 'quite', 'well.Stewart', 'also', 'Ghost', 'Hamlet', 'father', 'interesting', 'choice', 'suggesting', 'Hamlet', 'disparaging', 'comparisons', 'father', 'uncle', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'exaggerated', 'accurate', 'choice', 'lot', 'food', 'thought', 'characters.Unfortunately', 'Tennant', 'Stewart', 'shine', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'underwhelming', 'comparison', 'Gertrude', 'Ophelia', 'are', 'competent', 'not', 'exceptional', 'Ophelia', 'mad', 'rant', 'singing', 'giving', 'out', 'flowers', 'flat', 'forced', 'compared', 'Tennant', 'easygoing', 'frenzy', 'Polonius', 'Horatio', 'are', 'okay', 'unremarkable', 'Surprisingly', 'Mark', 'Hadfield', 'gravedigger', 'off', 'equal', 'Tennant', 'actor', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'bumped', 'up', 'Polonius', 'role.Many', 'elements', 'setting', 'are', 'used', 'emphasize', 'various', 'themes', 'use', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'CCTV', 'are', 'often', 'referred', 'here', 'UK', 'little', 'odd', 'Snippets', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'surveillance', 'footage', 'one', 'point', 'Hamlet', 'out', 'one', 'cameras', 'Now', 'am', 'alone', 'Spying', 'deception', 'damage', 'cause', 'are', 'more', 'critical', 'elements', 'story', 'had', 'considered', 'before.Another', 'element', 'use', 'mirrors', 'Claudius', 'Polonius', 'spy', 'Hamlet', 'Ophelia', 'conversation', 'one-way', 'mirror', 'When', 'Hamlet', 'Polonius', 'shoots', 'mirrored', 'door', 'point', 'almost', 'everyone', 'shattered', 'reflections', 'showing', 'damage', 'so', 'much', 'deceit', 'done', 'interesting', 'device', ""n't"", 'overplayed.Taken', 'whole', 'film', 'version', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Many', 'thought', 'provoking', 'ideas', 'are', 'brought', 'play', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'delved', 'deeply', 'before', 'Tennant', 'performance', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'portrayal', 'mad', 'Dane']",N/A

For the person who is not sure they will like Hamlet, this might be a good one to watch. Patrick Stewart was simply fabulous as Claudius and as the ghost.That said, I thought some of it was over-acted. David Tennant, who played Hamlet, continues being over-the-top, even in solo scenes - it works when he is trying to convince others that he is mad, less so when he does not have an 'audience'. I liked his interaction with Rosencrantz & Guildenstern, after it has become obvious they are doing the king's bidding. He properly should have that anger, to show his displeasure and distrust, while appearing crazy to avoid showing his hand. The grave digger scene is good, but the actor who portrayed the grave digger found himself too funny, which can make it rather less so for the audience.Some of the bits with mirrors and cameras were too clever by half to really work well. I was reminded of the use of video in the Ethan Hawke ""Hamlet"", though there it seemed more integral to the approach than in this version.

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[4, 9]","This film of Gregory Doran's RSC production links two popular TV actors with some of Britain's best stage actors to great effect.  It mixes high energy and dark humor with elaborate set pieces and lavish design in a presentation that breathes new life into the oft-played classic.  Though it may not sit well with viewers unaccustomed to theatre, Bard lovers will find plenty they can call their own.In RSC tradition, this film makes only minor changes to the demands of the camera.  Robert Jones' gorgeous production design partially contemporizes the physical look, putting the characters in designer suits in a very industrial-looking palace, while keeping period elements like gaslight and saber-fighting.  The production complements the actors without overwhelming their performances.Though most of the ensemble has little camera credit, they keep perfect pace with the famous leads.  Peter De Jersey as Horatio carries melancholy that threatens Hamlet's spotlight.  Mariah Gale's Ophelia blindsides with such quiet intensity that I cannot help but think Gale will be famous in her own right soon.  And Penny Downie's Gertrude goes from luscious wife to broken old woman with astonishing speed.Cinematically, this production suffers a little in the transition from the stage.  The cameras tend to be still too often, making us a bit too aware of what we're watching.  And the images of mirror and security camera get somewhat ham-handed.  I understand that Doran wanted us to consider the indirect nature of what we see, but the images come up just a smidge too often, and distract from the show.Viewers weaned on TV may not get as much good out of this production as they ought to, because it is intensely theatrical.  But that risk is worth it for the chance to see two acclaimed actors play roles so wildly different from what we normally associate with them.

1333139,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B0038RSIGA,Little Roy Blue,"[13, 19]","I hate to start out on a snobby note, but I've got to say that it amuses me to see this version of Hamlet so often described as ""breathing new life"" into a classic play and making it ""relevant"" to contemporary audiences. You see, this strikes me as a *very* orthodox adaptation of Hamlet that does little to update the play or revolutionize the way it's staged (I'm pretty sure that a few previous productions have shown Hamlet in a t-shirt, for example). Also, I tend to think that contemporary audiences need Hamlet a lot more than Hamlet needs contemporary audiences.Ahem. With that out of the way, what do I really think of this production? Well, it's a mixed bag. Since I'm a traditionalist where Shakespeare is concerned, to me it's actually a bonus that the presentation of this version is fairly traditional. There are no gaudy special effects here (yay!), and Shakespeare's language is preserved in all its glory (if a little edited, inevitably). The cast consists of very good actors (for the most part) who obviously have a ton of experience with this sort of thing. Patrick Stewart stands out as a very dignified - if not terribly exciting - Claudius.Unfortunately, the most important bit of casting - our miserable protagonist, Hamlet himself - was sort of botched. David Tennant has massive star appeal in the U.K.; at the time he made this, he was drawing in huge audiences for the BBC science fiction show Doctor Who. However, I must confess that Tennant's appeal is lost on me. I thought he overacted terribly as Doctor Who and failed to convey the character's genius, and his acting here has exactly the same defects. His performance is by no means universally bad, though. During quiet or reflective moments, he can be very effective. But whenever he enters shouty, teeth-bearing, crazy gesticulating mode, he just ... loses me.My other problem with this production is that it looks very cheap. The quality of the film is fine, and the lighting is appropriately cinematic, but there are only a few sets and there are almost no extras. Also, I think the location was poorly chosen; the black, shiny backgrounds are extremely distracting.Still, there is nothing particularly bad about this adaptation. I enjoyed seeing it, and appreciated some of the director's unique ""touches."" It's just that I don't think this production can hold a candle to the Branagh film (for its comprehensiveness and star power) or the Olivier film (for its, uh, coolness).

This is an amazing production of THE most popular play in CLASSIC Theatre of all time. An amazing cast, amazingly directed and a wonderful twist on the production side of seeing this classic.Reading from the original text, from the original play, this production has a tone and movement that keeps you glued to the screen. This is the actual HD VIDEO production what was the orginally play performed on the stage of the actual Royal Shakespearan Company in Europe for over a year!Directed by Gregory Doran in a visually contemporary style, the production looks as if it was shot today, right down the street. The costumes, the sets, the light is very modern and real. It takes the look of the fact that Shakespeare might have written this for your family - while watching the family of Hamlet literally unraveling with lust, intrigue and murder.Hat's off to Patrick Stewart (Star Trek TNG) for playing the duel roles of Claudius and his brother - HAMLETS father's - a Ghost! What can be said about Mr. Stweart - except that he was BORN to do Shakespeare! Commanding and speaking the original text as if it were written just for hiM!My amaement really came from a stunning performance by Mr. David Tennat (Doctor Who #10). He really gave the title character an extremely interesting, funny and provacative twist this legendary literary icon. I couldn't keep my attention off him. Especially when he and Patrick Stewart were on the same screen. Tennant was witty and surprisingly funny! David took the facial expressions and mannersism of a clown and make you laugh and fear in the same breadth. Watches his eyes!Other great performances came from Oliver Ford Davies as Polonius, Penny Downey as Gertrude, Peter de Jersey as Horatio and Edward Bennett as Laertes. A great ensemble of performers who obviously work well together!The third most outstanding performance came from Mariah Gale as Ophelia. She was creepy and funny and scary and memzmorizing! When she flips at her fathers death - and then her brothers death - it is chills you to the bone! Watch her eyes!The bonus features include a behind the scenes retrospective of the making of the production with interviews of all the cast and crew. And there is a really interesting commentary with the director and many of the production staff.Definately my new favorite production of this Age-Old story.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[4, 5]","Before watching this I had not heard of David Tennant, although he is a household name in England for playing Doctor Who.Now, having watched this I must say I am hugely impressed. He does not act Hamlet. He is Hamlet. In fact he has a certain quirkiness that lends itself to Hamlet's feigned madness. Even though we know he is putting on an antic disposition, because he says so, yet we don't know if he has crossed the line from feigned madness to real madness. We do have good reason to wonder given the extremity of what happens.If you're like me, as you watch this version the fresh insights come dripping fast. What struck me particularly were the parallels between Hamlet, Ophelia, and Laertes, all of whom have experienced the same event, the murder of the father. Hamlet responds by pretending madness but being passive and indecisive, considering suicide as in being and non being, Ophelia responds with real madness and actual suicide, and Laertes responds in a more active way by decisively challenging Hamlet to avenge the death of both his father and his sister.The queen falls under the witchcraft and wits of Claudius gifts, 'with witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,-- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power to seduce our seeming virtuous queen.' Apparently, this is a rather pointed reference to Archbishop W(h)itgift, who with his Machiavellian tactics seduced the ear of Queen Elizabeth, while hoping to ascend to Peter's chair. In any event this reference was removed from the original 1603 quarto, reappearing in the 1604 quarto, after Whitgift, and Elizabeth's death.I loved this modernised setting of Hamlet, with the original language, with the closed circuit tv's, reinforcing the idea that Hamlet was being constantly watchied by double dealing courtiers. Compared to Zeffirelli's version of Hamlet where Polonius is a wise old man, here he is a hard to pin down courtier, who carefully contrives to be non committal in his answers.All the elements of the writer seem to work. I liked the speak the speech scene, Act 2, Scene2, where they spent 70 lines discussing the killing of Priam from the obscure play Dido by Marlowe. I loved the wit of the gravedigger scene.

I personally think this is a brilliant concept, that adds another layer of meaning to the play while being entirely consistent with Shakespeare's text: Hamlet is constantly being _observed_, by his enemies as well as we the play's audience, and it nearly drives him crazy. In execution, though, I found the grainy cam-scenes in this movie to be distancing and off-putting.The principal actors in this play will be very familiar to American as well as English audiences; David Tennant (Hamlet) has played Dr. Who, and Patrick Stewart (Claudius/Hamlet's Ghost) has played Captain Picard in Star Trek. Stewart, a fine Shakespearean actor, displays both auctoritas and gravitas in his role; Oliver Davies as Polonius, Edward Bennet as Laertes, and Peter de Jersey as Horatio, are also very good.A major reservation in this review is David Tennant's performance as Hamlet. As an actor he is entirely committed to the role, but I was honestly put off by his extreme facial expressions and bodily contortions. Consider Hamlet's advice to the players: ""Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, by use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness."" Tennant's performance is the mirror opposite of this. One can make a case for it, taking Hamlet's advice ironically, or by deliberate contrast to Stewart's Claudius, but to me this is not my preferred style of acting.That said, if you like a Hamlet who outrageously chews the scenery, then you will be pleased to own this disk.",3,A Contrarian Review,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,2411,"['Many', 'critics', 'Hamlet', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'really', 'think', 'many', 'will', 'like', 'more', 'did', 'anyway', 'did', 'stick', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'given', 'overall', 'three-star', 'neutral', 'rating.The', 'production', 'modern-dress', 'minimum', 'very', 'small', 'number', 'actors', 'feels', 'film', 'stage', 'production', 'rather', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'director', 'tricks', 'look', 'closely', 'mirrors', 'reflecting', 'floors', 'etc', 'Big', 'Concept', 'here', 'action', 'play', 'observed', 'Big', 'Brother', 'spy-cams', 'ones', 'are', 'actually', 'set', 'up', 'London', 'other', 'cities', 'England', 'today', 'personally', 'think', 'brilliant', 'concept', 'layer', 'meaning', 'play', 'being', 'entirely', 'consistent', 'Shakespeare', 'text', 'Hamlet', 'constantly', 'being', '_observed_', 'enemies', 'as', 'well', 'play', 'audience', 'nearly', 'crazy', 'execution', 'found', 'grainy', 'cam-scenes', 'movie', 'be', 'distancing', 'off-putting.The', 'principal', 'actors', 'play', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'familiar', 'American', 'as', 'well', 'English', 'audiences', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Hamlet', 'played', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Claudius/Hamlet', 'Ghost', 'played', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Stewart', 'fine', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'auctoritas', 'gravitas', 'role', 'Oliver', 'Davies', 'Polonius', 'Edward', 'Bennet', 'Laertes', 'Peter', 'de', 'Jersey', 'Horatio', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good.A', 'major', 'reservation', 'review', 'David', 'Tennant', 'performance', 'Hamlet', 'actor', 'entirely', 'committed', 'role', 'was', 'honestly', 'put', 'off', 'extreme', 'facial', 'expressions', 'bodily', 'contortions', 'Consider', 'Hamlet', 'advice', 'players', 'Speak', 'speech', 'pray', 'pronounced', 'trippingly', 'tongue', 'mouth', 'many', 'players', 'do', 'had', 'lief', 'town', 'crier', 'spoke', 'lines', 'do', 'not', 'saw', 'air', 'too', 'much', 'hand', 'thus', 'use', 'gently', 'very', 'torrent', 'tempest', 'may', 'say', 'whirlwind', 'passion', 'must', 'acquire', 'beget', 'temperance', 'may', 'give', 'smoothness', 'Tennant', 'performance', 'mirror', 'opposite', 'One', 'can', 'make', 'case', 'taking', 'Hamlet', 'advice', 'ironically', 'deliberate', 'contrast', 'Stewart', 'Claudius', 'not', 'preferred', 'style', 'acting.That', 'said', 'like', 'Hamlet', 'who', 'outrageously', 'scenery', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'own', 'disk']",N/A

The Royal Shakespeare Company generally produces admirable versions of the plays, and this one is one of their better productions.  Some of the performances are inconsistent, and the rearranged order often feels like a way to save money by filming continuously rather than a necessary reworking.  I liked the contemporary setting, but the security camera shots felt out of place as much as they seemed like a rip off from the 2000 adaptation with Ethan Hawke.  Similarly, Tennant's performance seems suspiciously similar to Branagh's in quite a few places.

1333149,A3MR82ZDTWBIAM,B0038RSIGA,Mostly Shakespeare,"[6, 7]","Reviews of productions such as this tend to be polarizing and less than objective. Tennant is popular enough as an actor that hosanna's will pile up regardless, and Doran has enough new, non-traditional ideas to invite some ""everything-should-be-period-dress"" herp-derpery. I find that when I set aside the rose colored glasses and uninformed ideals, I have to fall right in the middle. Doran has some great insight from the director's chair. He chooses an indefinite time-setting. The fashion at the court scenes looks to me to be early twentieth century, Hamlet's camera seems to be from about the forties, but Hamlet's jeans and printed tee ares clearly contemporary. The story takes place out of time in the pretend world of theatre, but in a recognizable world which makes these characters seem realistic and plausible. He succeeds particularly well with the player scenes. Here, for once, Hamlet does not simply take over the production. The player king chaffes at Hamlet's interfierences with a ""leave-it-to-the-professionals"" condescension that highlights how vague and impractical some of Hamlet's directions to the players are. The dumb-show becomes an edgy drag-show in which the sexsual sin shows as tawdry, sleazy and viscerally unappealling. The mirror which Hamlet breaks to kill Polonious haunts Gertrude in Ophelia's first mad scene, coloring Ophelia's proclamation that ""we know what we are, we know not what we may be"" and reminding Gertrude of Hamlet's indictment of the closet scene. Yet Hamlet's video camera, and the shots of the battlement scene which appear to come from a security camera as well as a moment in which Hamlet unplugs a camera before pronouncing ""Now I am alone"", feel tacked-on for the transfer to television and offer little insight. Worse, many scenes fail to find the tragic granduer the play can offer. The climax offered little power and by ""good night sweet prince"" I was bored senseless.Of course the bulk of the ink spilt over this production will be in appraisal Tennant's highly anticipated performance as Hamlet. I admit to approaching it with great suspicision. After a run as one of the worst Doctors in history (come at me nerds!), I braced myself for the worst. I was surprised at how sympathetic I was. Like Kline or Branah, Tennant focuses on the ""Antic disposition"" Hamlet adopts to confuse the court. The quirk and manic energy he adopts here seem to me much less forced than in Doctor Who. In private moments Tennant conveys the deep hurt Hamlet feels with quiet, understated delivery. It's often very effective if not mesmerizing. Yet these performances which focus so much on Hamlet's bratt-ier moments always come up short when Hamlet has to remind himself to ""speak daggers but use none"" to his mother. The tall, lanky Tennant outfitted in a flesh-colored tee ironically printed with six-pack abs just isn't intimidating. I may laugh at him but I wouldn't panic if he got my foil off me.Sir. Patrick Stewart garnered much praise for his Claudius, but I am not entirely convinced. No doubt Stewart has grown enourmously as an actor since his 1980 performance in the same role for the BBC. No other Shakespearean actor I know does so much to allow the audience to see his characters think. This resulted in a chilling Macbeth for Rupert Goold, but seems somewhat out of place here. He delivers ""though yet the memory of Hamlet our dear brother's death"" as if it were extempore and not the slick, calculated rhetoric it is. I miss some of the force and passion of his earlier work in the interpretation of this deeply conflicted and tormented man. Penny Downie as Gertrude seems to me by far the most valuable part of the production. Shakespeare often focused on the hell of being a child but also gave great insight into the hell of being a parent, and Downie makess us feel every bit of it. The closet scene is the best I have seen on film. Gertrude is shattered, but when Hamlet confidently commands her to ""throw away the worser part"" of her heart she laughes sarcastically in his face. For a moment Hamlet's dignity as self-titled ""scourge and minister"" totters and seems little more than little-boy idealism. Gertrude has not forgotten all the real-world considerations. At court too, she shows as intellegent and in joint command with Claudius. Mariah Gale and Edward Bennett are competent but unimpressive as Ophelia and Laertes. Oliver Ford Davies left me cold as a foolish, dottering Polonius and by the end I was bored at the sight of Peter De Jersey's Horatio.In the end this production offers some great ideas and even some brilliant power that serious Shakespeare fans like me will relish and devote overly long Amazon reviews to, but does not scale the heights that Hamlet has to offer. All the same I think any serious fan will find it worth his or her time and I highly recommend Penny Downie's Gertrude as worth the price of entry.",3,Very Interesting if Uneven,1359244800,"01 27,

They cut out the most essential lines in the play:Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy lifeExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,Hamlet was metaphorically and psychologically (and perhaps literally) possessed by the warlike spirit of his dead father. He had erased himself from the book and volume of his brain and written his father's commandment there. His father was the voice of Denmark, sent from Hell to speak of horrors, to breathe contagion, unfolding the secrets of his prison-house that he was forbid to tell to mortal ears. His father, unable to part from his earthly kingdom, was doomed to walk the night in search of his ""extorted treasure in the womb of earth.""There was another reference to treasure in the play: Ophelia's ""chaste treasure."" Ophelia, like Hamlet, was also untrue to herself by being excessively obedient to her father. She let him tell her what to think. Her very name is an allusion to excessive filial duty.When Ophelia died, her grave was metaphorically the grave of filial duty - the final inevitable end to which obedience to their fathers brought Ophelia and Hamlet, to their ""marriage-bed."" When Hamlet jumped into Ophelia's grave he was finally giving his father's ghost what it had been seeking - Ophelia's chaste treasure in the womb of earth, the grave of filial duty.When Hamlet leaped into Ophelia's grave and was choked by Laertes, he said,I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;For, though I am not splenitive and rash,Yet have I something in me dangerous,Which let thy wiseness fear:That ""something in me"" was the last appearance of the Ghost, who had finally been delivered to the grave where he belonged.As Gertrude said,This is mere madness:And thus awhile the fit will work on him;Anon, as patient as the female dove,When that her golden couplets are disclosed,His silence will sit drooping.When Hamlet emerged from that grave he was no longer ""from himself taken away.""

First of all, Tennant, at times goes against Hamlet's directions to all players: ""suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance: o'erstep not the modesty of nature."" Tennant's Hamlet tends to ham it up a bit too much. Still, it kind of works.The main problem here is Stewart.  To start with, his dual role as Old Hamlet and Claudius make it ring strange when Hamlet says their comparison is like Hyperion to a Satyr. Same face, same build, same mannerisms, same gait, slightly different beard.Stewart also plays certain key scenes in a very squirrely way. When the actors re-create the murder in front of him, there is no visible gasp of recognition for Horatio to witness. Hamlet is filming him the whole time with a hand-held cam, but there's no money shot.Stewart's death scene is frustrating and unsatisfying as well: Hamlet points the rapier at him and orders him to drink his own poison (Kill yourself or I'll kill you!). Stewart's Claudius promptly obeys, drinks deep, and falls over dead instantly.Cuts made from the full script were, more often than not, thoughtful and logical to the production. The only one that really left me saying, ""huh?"" was the omission of the final scene were Fortinbras and his armies arrive--including the final speeches.The rest of the actors were serviceable and believable in their parts, and the directorial choices were mostly clear and smart. One particularly strong scene is between Hamlet and the Player King.

1333158,A6FIAB28IS79,B0038RSIGA,Samuel Chell,"[4, 4]","Arguably (but barely) Shakespeare's greatest play (not to mention the most indispensable piece of literature in English), ""Hamlet"" is a work of such depth, complexity and universal resonance that it defies not only explication but representations that can come close to the themes that unfold in each individual spectator's ""theater of the mind.""  Yet this latest, admittedly spare but protein-powered production comes as close as any to ""getting it right.""  A production transferred to the cinematic screen with a minimum of fuss, this is a version of theater's most renowned character that, much like the numerous mirrors on the set, reflects back to the spectator the archetypal, universal Hamlet that IS each one of us.  The occasional B&W; shots through a TV camera lens, while initially slightly jarring and distracting, are soon mere reminders that in this version of the Bard's text, we are not theater patrons witnessing a public spectacle but ""privileged"" participants in a very private, personalized ""playing out"" of the problematic existence each of us struggles to understand.  Like Hamlet, each of us is blessed/cursed with the gift of self-consciousness, forcing us to confront--despite all distractions, entertainments, and various diversions and denials--the inescapable, overriding fact of human existence: we all will die.Though I was tired after experiencing with the family the usual ""cinematic noise"" and non-stop feverish pitch of ""Up,"" ""Polar Bear Express,"" and ""How to Train a Dragon"" (is there really any hope left for the close reading of non-illustrated texts or, for that matter, the life of the imagination?)--I stayed up and soon became too caught up in this ""Hamlet"" to follow common sense and get some sleep in preparation for yet another attempt at playing a genial grandpa Santa Claus.  Despite seeing a dozen previous Hamlets, including Olivier, Williamson, Burton, Gibson, Branagh, and Hawke (I'm still waiting for the inevitable appearance of a female Hamlet), I couldn't tear myself loose from this Hamlet--or perhaps it was Claudius--even as the time approached 4 A.M.).Perhaps as never before, the play best epitomizing Keats' praise of Shakespeare as the author who, more than any other, possessed that rarest of all qualities--i.e. ""negative capability""--cast its spell, taking me not to the usual remediable excesses of tragic heroes but to the fallibility--and frailty--of the human condition itself.  Even King Lear's suffering and insanity, his extreme destitution and irrevocable loss--while it has the power to unnerve the strongest among us--offers a rationale, a fatal flaw, a consolation in the form of a reason for Lear's descent to nihilism.  But Hamlet is unique. No work in literature focuses so intensely, insistently, uncompromisingly and unsparingly on the subject of death, in the process leading us to meditate on the meaning of life, on religion, and on the value and  validity of the consolations (such as the Christmas story) that we turn to in the face of death's unavoidable arrival.As in all of Shakespeare's plays and poetry, there are no ""claims"" that cannot be proven by the language itself.  Hamlet's hypothesizing about a ""Providence governing the affairs of men,"" about a Divinity ""whose attention is on the eye of a sparrow,"" is quickly neutralized by Hamlet's language expressing a different, even opposite, point of view.  Any positive notion is expressed less as a certitude than as a faint hope, a wish, a prayer rather than an epiphany, revelation, or ""earned"" insight.  The play starts with Hamlet's search for certainty, and it ends in uncertainty.  And after the death of Hamlet, we as spectators are left with the point of view of his surviving friend Horatio, offering a prayer that somehow Hamlet's life has had meaning. Or we may struggle to find meaning in Hamlet's dying request of Horatio that his ""story"" will be told (what story? what's to tell? why? what's the gain?).  But Horatio can only pray that the soul of his friend, the ""sweet prince,"" may be ""accompanied by flights of angels.""  And what are we to make of this death scene? Like all Hamlets preceding him (and like each of us), this Hamlet wants, at the very least, to be remembered, and better yet, as an individual whose life meant something. After experiencing (and expressing) the gamut of human emotions concerning the subject of death, Hamlet allows us to see that death is the loneliest experience of all.  Compared to the adolescent feelings of a Romeo or Juliet, Hamlet is extraordinarily wise beyond his years.  He knows that death cannot be ""shared"": it's each man's and woman's necessarily private journey--and it's the thought that the destination could lead to oblivion, or the extinction of ""self,"" that weighs on him most heavily of all.It's ironic but understandable that such a role does not call for an actor who projects singular strength of character, or extraordinary eloquence (""Words, words, words"" Hamlet utters dismissively) or, above all, the self-assurance of someone who confidently, blindly, habitually thinks he's ""right"" (even about the circumstances of his father's death) and accordingly presumes he has privileged access to and possession of ""the"" truth.  Rather, the character is at once ""driven""--first, by virtually every emotion that death is capable of arousing and, secondly, he's impelled to say everything that human beings are capable of expressing about the subject whose only certainty is the end will come, whether sooner or later: therefore ""readiness is all.""  ""Hamlet"" takes us from the fleshly chamber of the womb to the worm-ridden skulls of the tomb: it's Shakespeare's ""realistic"" account of the actions we read about in the New Testament; it's an essential prelude to reading Quentin's unforgettable monologue (Chapter 2) in Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury.""David Tennant may not be the most handsome, assured, ""heroic"" actor to play Hamlet.  But we're more likely to recognize ourselves in his performance than most other Hamlets who come to mind.  He's a Hamlet who's ""in over his head""--and so too are we all, from the very moment of birth into a finite existence that defies us to make sense of the sensory world (let alone speak with certainty about a non-sensory realm). This production uses Tennant as a vehicle for Shakespeare's language and ideas--it doesn't burden the character with Oedipal complexes, incestuous feelings toward his mother, obsessive paralysis, florid rhetoric, and a host of original twists some later directors and actors feel obliged to introduce into the play.But what is most notable about this production is Patrick Stewart's Claudius, who is without a doubt the most dignified and admirable adulterer, murderer, and usurper to play the so-called ""villainous"" role.  What do we make of such a character?  Is his enviable composure so great that we can only infer that the man he replaced--i.e. Hamlet's ""real"" father--must have been a scoundrel deserving to be forever denied access to Gertrude's bed?  Or might we surmise that if Claudius looks this good to us, Hamlet's real father must have been some sort of demigod?  Or is it just possible that Claudius is unconvincing as a ""villain"" or ""scoundrel"" because ""Hamlet"" is simply too great and honest a work to bother with the cliched plot of good guys vs. bad guys?  or with the familiar Manichaean dichotomy (condemned by the early Christian church as heresy) between good and evil?  Even when evil is defeated--and removed--human existence continues to be about question and uncertainty; life remains unbearably hard.  As Buddhists seem to know so well, to live is to suffer.  The movies may provide us with a ""happy ending,"" but who can leave the theater without sensing that there WILL be, happy or not, an ""ending""?  Of course, some fairy tales presume to go beyond their endings, adding that the character(s) ""lived happily ever after.""  It's a comfort, to be sure, but as mature and self-reflective mortals we cannot deny that it's also a lie.Shakespeare doesn't lie.  No play testifies to the Bard's honesty as powerfully as ""Hamlet,"" and few productions of the play testify to Shakespeare's unequalled candor as believably as this one.",5,"The most universal ""Hamlet""?

Geeck ""wizardoz30""","[2, 2]","Okay, I need to start out with saying I have read a few reviews where people did not like the portrayal of Hamlet in this edition but I must respectfully disagree (as did Prince Charles, who actually sent David Tennant a letter to commend him on his portrayal of the Danish prince).  This movie puts some interesting modern spins on the story, such as the security cameras and the video camera Hamlet uses during the players scenes, but nothing so far out of the comfort zone of the story that Shakespeare purists would be disappointed.  The main complaint most had about Tennant was that he went too far into the 'Hamlet is crazy' part and the reviewers thought that wasn't what Shakespeare intended...Well first we should note that 1) Trying to guess at a deceased writers intentions is dangerous ground because there is too much room for debate and 2) What the author intended for the story to be is not nearly important as what the reader/viewer gets out of it.  So without disregarding the opinions of those other reviewers I would like to contend that the Is he/Isn't he debate about Hamlet being crazy is what the story is really going for.  That is what makes it great!  You have no idea if he's playing at being crazy or if he was playing and now he has drifted over the line into actual insanity or if he was insane all along and THAT is the beauty of this play.  The fact that at some points Tennant plays him as truly mad and at other times he follows a dose of crazy up with a wink or a smile at the camera or his friends is what makes this absolutely charming.I love Shakespeare and while I wouldn't go as far as to call myself a Shakespeare purist, I do like to see the plays fairly close to form, so the DiCaprio/Danes Romeo & Juliet, for example, pushed it a little to far, but this version of 'Hamlet' stays well within the bounds of the Bard.  For those who love 'Hamlet', I can offer no better review than this: This version is my new favorite version of the play.  Patrick Stewart gives a new depth to Claudius that I found captivating.  To those who disagree with Tennant I have to suggest perhaps it is a dislike for the actor himself and not this specific performance (Some noted their issues with his performance in Doctor Who...so it seems like there may be clouded judgment there).  If my opinion counts for anything (if it doesn't that is perfectly okay!) I just want those who really want to know that I loved this adaptation.",5,Stellar rendition of 'Hamlet',1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,2455,"['Okay', 'need', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'have', 'read', 'few', 'reviews', 'where', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'portrayal', 'Hamlet', 'edition', 'must', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'did', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'who', 'actually', 'sent', 'David', 'Tennant', 'letter', 'commend', 'portrayal', 'Danish', 'prince', 'movie', 'interesting', 'modern', 'spins', 'story', 'such', 'security', 'cameras', 'video', 'camera', 'Hamlet', 'players', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'so', 'far', 'comfort', 'zone', 'story', 'Shakespeare', 'purists', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'main', 'complaint', 'most', 'had', 'Tennant', 'was', 'went', 'too', 'far', ""'Hamlet"", 'crazy', 'part', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'Shakespeare', 'intended', 'Well', 'first', 'should', 'note', '1', 'Trying', 'guess', 'deceased', 'writers', 'intentions', 'dangerous', 'ground', 'too', 'much', 'room', 'debate', '2', 'What', 'author', 'intended', 'story', 'be', 'not', 'nearly', 'important', 'what', 'reader/viewer', 'So', 'disregarding', 'opinions', 'other', 'reviewers', 'would', 'like', 'contend', 'Is', 'he/Is', ""n't"", 'debate', 'Hamlet', 'being', 'crazy', 'what', 'story', 'really', 'going', 'what', 'great', 'have', 'idea', 'playing', 'being', 'crazy', 'was', 'playing', 'now', 'drifted', 'line', 'actual', 'insanity', 'was', 'insane', 'all', 'along', 'THAT', 'beauty', 'play', 'fact', 'points', 'Tennant', 'truly', 'mad', 'other', 'times', 'dose', 'crazy', 'wink', 'smile', 'camera', 'friends', 'what', 'absolutely', 'charming.I', 'love', 'Shakespeare', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'call', 'Shakespeare', 'purist', 'do', 'see', 'plays', 'fairly', 'close', 'form', 'DiCaprio/Danes', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'example', 'pushed', 'little', 'far', 'version', ""'Hamlet"", 'stays', 'well', 'bounds', 'Bard', 'who', 'love', ""'Hamlet"", 'can', 'offer', 'better', 'review', 'version', 'new', 'favorite', 'version', 'play', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'new', 'depth', 'Claudius', 'found', 'captivating', 'who', 'disagree', 'Tennant', 'have', 'suggest', 'perhaps', 'dislike', 'actor', 'not', 'specific', 'performance', 'noted', 'issues', 'performance', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'clouded', 'judgment', 'there', 'opinion', 'counts', 'anything', ""n't"", 'perfectly', 'okay', 'just', 'want', 'who', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'loved', 'adaptation']",N/A

1333162,A277UC8WJVAIIE,B0038RSIGA,The Wiz,"[1, 1]","This particular interpretation of Hamlet employs a surreal sort of WWI setting but with CCTV cameras placed throughout Elsinore castle, conveying a feel that many infer from the play of paranoia and espionage featuring sets both minimalist and lavish with polished, black floors mirroring crystal chandeliers and characters in tuxedos and ballroom gowns.David Tennant in the starring role is an emotional pendulum swinging between hyperactive to melancholy, representing a remarkably funny Hamlet whereas his ""to be or not to be"" speech was unique and moving, leaving an indelible mark on this legendary character.  Patrick Stewart presents a Claudius who is both master of the warlike state of Denmark and conniving villain, often seething with contempt for prince Hamlet, which probably reflects the motivations for his own brother's murder, and yet truly pitiable as a victim of his own ambition.  Also worth mentioning are: Ophelia's mesmerizing descent into madness from act IV scene V which elicits both pity and laughter, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as sycophantic buffoons with a high comedic factor and finally Peter de Jersey as Horatio who subtly transcends being simply Hamlet's confidant.The real spotlight of this production though I believe belongs to Oliver Ford Davies as Polonius who brings undeniable charm to a character usually played as an over-the-hill conniver.  Davies' timing is impeccable, evoking legitimate laughter as he frequently rambles off home-spun philosophy, sympathy as he becomes the object of Hamlet's own contempt, respect and maybe even affection as he attempts to be the best possible father to his children.  The combination of Davies and director Gregory Doran bring a complexity to this character that's lacking in other productions I've seen and this, combined with all the other outstanding performances I've mentioned as well as the distinctive tone make this a version absolutely not to be missed.  :o)",5,Bet Ya Can't Watch It Just Once,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,1953,"['particular', 'interpretation', 'Hamlet', 'surreal', 'sort', 'WWI', 'setting', 'CCTV', 'cameras', 'placed', 'Elsinore', 'castle', 'conveying', 'feel', 'many', 'infer', 'play', 'paranoia', 'espionage', 'featuring', 'sets', 'minimalist', 'lavish', 'polished', 'black', 'floors', 'mirroring', 'crystal', 'chandeliers', 'characters', 'tuxedos', 'ballroom', 'gowns.David', 'Tennant', 'starring', 'role', 'emotional', 'pendulum', 'swinging', 'hyperactive', 'melancholy', 'representing', 'remarkably', 'funny', 'Hamlet', 'whereas', 'be', 'not', 'be', 'speech', 'was', 'unique', 'moving', 'leaving', 'indelible', 'mark', 'legendary', 'character', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Claudius', 'who', 'master', 'warlike', 'state', 'Denmark', 'conniving', 'villain', 'often', 'seething', 'contempt', 'prince', 'Hamlet', 'probably', 'motivations', 'own', 'brother', 'murder', 'yet', 'truly', 'pitiable', 'victim', 'own', 'ambition', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'are', 'Ophelia', 'mesmerizing', 'descent', 'madness', 'act', 'IV', 'scene', 'V', 'pity', 'laughter', 'Rosencrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'sycophantic', 'buffoons', 'high', 'comedic', 'factor', 'finally', 'Peter', 'de', 'Jersey', 'Horatio', 'who', 'subtly', 'being', 'simply', 'Hamlet', 'confidant.The', 'real', 'spotlight', 'production', 'believe', 'belongs', 'Oliver', 'Ford', 'Davies', 'Polonius', 'who', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'character', 'usually', 'played', 'over-the-hill', 'conniver', 'Davies', 'timing', 'impeccable', 'evoking', 'legitimate', 'laughter', 'frequently', 'home-spun', 'philosophy', 'sympathy', 'object', 'Hamlet', 'own', 'contempt', 'respect', 'maybe', 'even', 'affection', 'be', 'best', 'possible', 'father', 'children', 'combination', 'Davies', 'director', 'Gregory', 'Doran', 'bring', 'complexity', 'character', 'lacking', 'other', 'productions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'combined', 'other', 'outstanding', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'as', 'well', 'distinctive', 'tone', 'make', 'version', 'absolutely', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'o']",N/A
