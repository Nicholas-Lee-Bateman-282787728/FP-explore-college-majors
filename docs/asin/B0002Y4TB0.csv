850264,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B0002Y4TB0,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[88, 92]","Kathy Griffin is the only celebrity (albeit a ""D List"" celebrity) who doesn't seem to know about that little unspoken rule that all celebrities are expected to live by.  You know what I'm talking about, right?  There's this rule somewhere when you sign that celebrity contract which states that you aren't allowed to talk about the mean, stupid, rude, clueless, carpy and/or tasteless things that other celebs do off-camera.  Not only has Kathy Griffin forgotten that taboo, she's made a career out of breaking it - and yes Kathy, we do love you for it!Allegedly is Griffin's latest installment in her ongoing mission to expose the truth about the beautiful people who normally have complete control over their carefully constructed public images.  OTOH here's Kathy:  blunt, open and the opposite of all things pretentious.  She has that way about her that suggests that you're meeting your best friend for lunch and a lot of dishing up on gossip.  Here is about one hour of taking down many sacred cows;  Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Walters, Eminem, Salma Hayek, and more.  She talks about her USO tour with other D lists and her VH1 Fashion Award encounters.  Her impersonations are spot-on funny.  We learn about behind sweat difficulties, which are surprisingly funny coming from Kathy.  A direct quote from my husband:  ""She's really very base; I like her!""Although I laughed often and well while watching Allegedly, I couldn't give a full five star rating because it seemed that a few things were off with Kathy on the night that this stand-up routine was filmed.  When I remembered her ""D List"" special from a few years ago as shown on Comedy Central I couldn't help but compare how relaxed and natural she seemed then compared to now; hurried, more on edge and a little angrier.  She seemed to be having less fun with her material, and so did I.  Nonetheless this is all great stuff and I strongly recommend Allegedly for any fans of hers and for anybody who's interested in a little glimpse into the goings-on of backstage life in Hollywood.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",4,Oh Kathy that is *so* appropriate!

850267,A3I8OURC83NM6V,B0002Y4TB0,"Christopher M. Fulton ""Purveyor of Truth""","[1, 1]","I think with Kathy Griffin, you need to have a slightly ""different"" sense of humor.  Her joke-telling is a tad left of standard.  Yet, they are funny.  She has charisma enough to put you at ease so you feel like you and her are best friends.  I think that's part of her charm and part of the reason she is so funny.  Now, I don't fall into either of her main categories, I'm a straight male, (you really need to have listened to her comedy to truly appreciate the first part of this comment) but I find her down right hilarious.  She pokes fun at the quirks of the ""A-list"" celebrities she talks about.  Her whole bit on Paris Hilton is freaking hilarious.  She's non-apologetic about her jokes and who she talks about.  There aren't too many people she won't talk about for the laugh.  And if you take her too seriously about it, that's your problem.  The bonus features on this are good as well.  This DVD reminds me of a celebrity rag filtered through, say, Sam Kinison.  Her mouth isn't quite as bad as Kinison's, but if you aren't into ""colorful"" language, don't buy this.  Now, I'm all for free speech, I don't think we should have to be censored because a few people don't like it, but I mention this so that those who don't like or are truly and honestly offended by such language don't buy this and complain later that ""I didn't know she talked like this!  This is unbearable!""  I mean, it isn't like every other word is a curse word, but there is a smattering.  So be warned.  But, if you are looking at this DVD, you are probably pretty familiar with the Kathy.

I love how she opens the show ""I don't have time to be positive"" she continues on to poke fun at everyone from the F-list (like, Debbie Gibson) up to A-Listers  (like Gweneth Paltrow). This is not Kathy's best performance and you can tell she's really scatter brained, she even forgets part of her show and has to ask her husband for help so she can remember. But like a trooper she keeps on going. If you like Kathy Griffin you'd really enjoy this DVD. I did. I'd love to have some of her other stuff on DVD though, more recent things. I don't know what to do now that Ellen isn't doing Stand Up anymore... Margaret Cho is too political to be funny, Paula Poundstone seems to be trying to make a comeback, Ellen's doing daytime TV.. so Kathy is pretty much the only funny lady out there right now.. So lets give her all the support we can!! Love Kathy, Love her Bad Attitude.. and the thing is, I'm sure she exaggerates a little in her stories for comedic effect, as anyone would, but I'm certain that everything she tells us is real... really happened. When she talks about Red Carpet stuff, you can go back and watch it (if you record it) and see that kind of stuff was really going on. Which makes it all the more funnier to know all she's doing is telling you what happened when she happened to be somewhere.  I dont' understand why celebrities are so afraid of her.

But this was just so fun to watch.  I mean not only did you get to hear how the celebs really act off camera, you get to hear it in a comical aspect that was delivered perfectly by the wonderful graces of Kathy.  She covered a lot in her 1 hour and 30 minutes of viewing time: from her VH1 Fashion Awards red carpet nightmare, to Book Shields' crazy wedding, to her battle on the set of The View with Barbara Walters, all the way to her USO tour to entertain the troops.This DVD is uncensored and therefor not meant as a holliday gift for all the little ones to hear unless you approve of your kids watching this.

This is not something you'll want to watch with the kids around...This DVD will mostly appeal to people interested in A-list celebrities and equipped with a good sense of sarcasm.  Don't expect any politically correct stuff on this disc.
