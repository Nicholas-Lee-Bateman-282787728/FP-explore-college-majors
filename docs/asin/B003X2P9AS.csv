In this case, a successful woman from Chicago is attempting to join her fiancee in Colorado for their Christmas eve wedding. Due to a mechanical problem on the plane and the busy travel season, she ends up on a bus and then a truck before being picked up by a school teacher widower and his daughter who also happen to be going to Colorado. At first they seem to be opposites and her big city ways clash with his love of hitting the backroads. However, by the time they reach his mother's house, they are warming to each other. Once she finds out he is more sophisticated than first met the eye and that her fiancee isn't what he appeared to be, the eventual ending is clear. This is a nice love story.

ROAD TO CHRISTMAS is strewn with predictable scenarios and conflicts. It's a 2006 holiday romantic comedy and a road picture. I do recommend it but with the caveat that you check out the other reviews. This isn't as family movie as some folks would prefer it to be, all because of one scene near the end. That scene actually had me busting out laughing. My two cents: I do think it is a bit inappropriate, given that ROAD TO CHRISTMAS seems to be promoted as one of them generic, uncontroversial Christmas family flicks. If I'd been watching this with my nieces or nephews, oboy, it would've gotten awkward and then I would've had to fend off their questions with an impromptu trip to Chucky Cheese.Claire Jameson (Jennifer Grey, DIRTY DANCING) has got it all. She has a thriving career as a fashion photographer. She's a bride-to-be, due to tie the knot in Aspen, Colorado on Christmas eve, only a few days away. Her Italian fianc&eacute;, Lorenzo, is a thoughtful, wealthy hunk, never mind that everyone seems to be broaching that stereotype about Italian men being these raucous, philandering gents. Claire is besotted with Lorenzo. When her photo shoot in Chicago is cancelled, she decides to surprise him with an early arrival in Aspen. She catches a flight.Meanwhile, widower Tom Pullman (Clark Gregg a.k.a. S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson) and his 13-year-old daughter Hilly (Megan Park) embark on their annual holiday road trip to Grandma's, from Chicago to Vail, Colorado. This would make a neat drinking game: take a shot each time the Pullman truck suffers some sort of mishap. And for those keeping tabs, Tom is the one who wears flannel. And Claire who's pampered.It'll be a horrible trek for Claire Jameson. First, she has to endure sitting in coach for her flight (oh no!). And when inclement weather forces her plane to make an unscheduled stop, she gets on a bus and ends up next to an old bum. The next leg of her journey finds her hitching a ride with a bunch of creepy woodsy hunters who end up throwing her luggage out the van. At this stage Claire meets Tom and Hilly Pullman. Despite that Tom wears flannel, she rides along in their truck. She and Tom are soon sniping at each other. Lorenzo never stood a chance.I liked ROAD TO CHRISTMAS, mostly because of the three lead actors. Gregg and Grey - who are married in real life - go about their romance in fairly realistic fashion, given that the premise partly echoes that of PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES. Megan Park, then a 20-year-old actress, looks convincing and is terrific as the 12- or 13-year-old daughter. Happily, the interactions among these three and the emotional connections made don't come off as too contrived, and that the comedy bits aren't too silly.

I wouldn't recommend this movie especially if you have young children.  First, her fiance was lying to her about his sexual orientation and then they act like its no big thing that the young daughter saw two men in bed together (even if it was another woman, they could have had the person come out of the bedroom with a robe on, not much better, but would be more tastefully done since it would have alluded to an affair).

You have . . . well you get the idea. Also the main character man looks the part but is too fem and too weak to be a masculine leading man character that he is supposed to be.

Not a lot of music to set the mood . . . you are left with the actors to do that etc which is good . . . a break from the Hollywood fiction. Anyway the ending was kinda a stretch. Who kisses another man on the eve of getting to their fiance to get married the day after that? Who kisses a man she knows nothing about? If we all made out with people we had to hang around a few minutes here and there there would be no relationships and marriages. Just ridiculous. Who walks in on their fiance with another man in his bed and then goes back in the house to talk? No one. You would be so repulsed and so disgusted and shocked you would flee. Who would run off and leave the ""woman I love"" after witnessing that? No one. Anyway there really isn't much to this movie. It is supposed to be a modern version of a many times over told story whether it is Christmas or not. Other than a pagan Christmas tree there is no mention of the reason for the season--Christ. You see a nativity scene and there is a faint Christmas Carol in the background (one of the few times music is heard in this) . . . but that is it. You would think from this movie Christmas is just another holiday.",2,kinda weak,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,2578,"['Umm', 'shallow', 'nice', 'woman', 'headed', 'Colorado', 'marry', 'Italian', 'fiance', 'only', 'have', 'transportation', 'troubles', 'way', 'change', 'transportation', 'several', 'times', 'ride', 'man', 'daughter.Umm', 'started', 'out', 'cute', 'movie', 'too', 'PC', 'enjoy', 'have', 'old', 'grandma', 'plane', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'promiscuous', 'destroy', 'sweet', 'grandma', 'image', 'have', 'gay', 'couple', 'have', 'artistic', 'woodsy', 'manly', 'man', 'have', 'vegetarians', 'have', 'well', 'get', 'idea', 'Also', 'main', 'character', 'man', 'part', 'too', 'fem', 'too', 'weak', 'be', 'masculine', 'leading', 'man', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'mean', 'cute', 'kinda', 'rugged', 'make', 'believe', 'clothes', 'truck', 'when', 'mouth', 'facade', 'also', 'just', 'umm', 'bitchy', 'instead', 'gruff', 'tough', 'man', 'chemistry', 'daughter', 'delivering', 'lines', 'pull', 'off', 'part', 'Jennifer', 'Grey', 'supposed', 'be', 'have', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'anyone', 'am', 'so', 'open', 'minded', 'shallow', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'just', 'fake', 'pretentious', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'main', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'pull', 'off', 'nice', 'Too', 'nice', ""n't"", 'really', 'step', 'air', 'head', 'domain', 'pull', 'off', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'nice', 'normal', 'slow', 'pace', 'Not', 'lot', 'music', 'set', 'mood', 'are', 'left', 'actors', 'do', 'etc', 'good', 'break', 'Hollywood', 'fiction', 'Anyway', 'ending', 'was', 'kinda', 'stretch', 'Who', 'man', 'eve', 'getting', 'fiance', 'get', 'married', 'day', 'Who', 'man', 'nothing', 'made', 'out', 'people', 'had', 'hang', 'around', 'few', 'minutes', 'here', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'relationships', 'marriages', 'Just', 'ridiculous', 'Who', 'walks', 'fiance', 'man', 'bed', 'then', 'back', 'house', 'talk', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'repulsed', 'so', 'disgusted', 'shocked', 'would', 'flee', 'Who', 'would', 'run', 'off', 'leave', 'woman', 'love', 'witnessing', 'one', 'Anyway', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'modern', 'version', 'many', 'times', 'told', 'story', 'Christmas', 'not', 'Other', 'pagan', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'mention', 'reason', 'season', 'Christ', 'see', 'nativity', 'scene', 'faint', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'background', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'music', 'heard', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'Christmas', 'just', 'holiday']",N/A
