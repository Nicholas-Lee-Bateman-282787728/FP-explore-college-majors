1205710,A1A4R6PU3QYVJ5,B001JAHQ0M,"Amazon Customer ""Serious Reader""","[0, 0]","For six seasons, ""Emergency!"" took millions of viewers inside the world of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, as firefighter/paramedics John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) faced new dangers and challenging rescues each week.  The show inspired many people to become paramedics, firefighters and doctors in real life, and also spawned an animated spinoff, ""Emergency 2+2"".""The Final Rescues"" is a set of six feature-length made-for-TV movies that bring about a fitting end to the series.  Although Gage and DeSoto have minor roles in three of the films, their presence is most assuredly felt.  Whether they are in familiar Los Angeles or visiting with crews in San Francisco or Seattle, they're always on the scene and ready to lend a hand.Of the six movies in this group, ""Survival on Charter #220"" is my personal favorite.  Not only did it feature most of the original ""Emergency!"" cast - except Robert Fuller, who played Dr. Brackett - it was a eerie case of art predicting life.  The horrific PSA Flight 182 crash occurred in San Diego just six months after ""Charter #220"" aired, and as in the movie, involved a large passenger jet colliding with a small private plane.My second favorite movie of the group is ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"", a retrospective show in which Gage and DeSoto, now captains and no longer eligible to work as paramedics, relive some of their most memorable adventures.  Those who've never actually watched ""Emergency!"" can watch this movie and get a good understanding of what the show was all about.There are some before-they-were-stars turns in these six movies as well, including Linda Gray (""Dallas""), Larry Manetti (""Magnum, P.I.""), and John de Lancie (""Star Trek: The Next Generation""), who shows up in three films - ""The Steel Inferno"" (as an actor looking for his wife in a burning high-rise), ""What's A Nice Girl Like You Doing..."" and ""The Convention"" (as a San Francisco doctor mimicking the roll of Dr. Brackett back in Los Angeles).  Some old veterans from the series, including William Boyett (as Captain Stanley's old rival, Chief McConnike) and Vince Howard (as the ever-present Los Angeles County Police officer), are also on hand.""The Final Rescues"" are a fine capstone to an influential and popular series that was among the best of its time.",4,A Fitting End to a Great Series,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,2320,"['six', 'seasons', 'Emergency', 'took', 'millions', 'viewers', 'world', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'County', 'Fire', 'Department', 'firefighter/paramedics', 'John', 'Gage', 'Randolph', 'Mantooth', 'Roy', 'DeSoto', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'faced', 'new', 'dangers', 'challenging', 'rescues', 'week', 'show', 'inspired', 'many', 'people', 'become', 'paramedics', 'firefighters', 'doctors', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'spawned', 'animated', 'spinoff', 'Emergency', '2+2', 'Final', 'Rescues', 'set', 'six', 'feature-length', 'made-for-TV', 'movies', 'bring', 'fitting', 'end', 'series', 'Gage', 'DeSoto', 'have', 'minor', 'roles', 'three', 'films', 'presence', 'most', 'assuredly', 'felt', 'are', 'familiar', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'visiting', 'crews', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Seattle', ""'re"", 'always', 'scene', 'ready', 'lend', 'hand.Of', 'six', 'movies', 'group', 'Survival', 'Charter', '220', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'feature', 'most', 'original', 'Emergency', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'who', 'played', 'Dr.', 'Brackett', 'was', 'eerie', 'case', 'art', 'predicting', 'life', 'horrific', 'PSA', 'Flight', '182', 'crash', 'occurred', 'San', 'Diego', 'just', 'six', 'months', 'Charter', '220', 'aired', 'movie', 'involved', 'large', 'passenger', 'jet', 'colliding', 'small', 'private', 'plane.My', 'second', 'favorite', 'movie', 'group', 'Greatest', 'Rescues', 'Emergency', 'retrospective', 'show', 'Gage', 'DeSoto', 'now', 'longer', 'eligible', 'work', 'paramedics', 'relive', 'most', 'memorable', 'adventures', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'watched', 'Emergency', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'get', 'good', 'understanding', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'are', 'before-they-were-stars', 'turns', 'six', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Linda', 'Gray', 'Dallas', 'Larry', 'Manetti', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'John', 'de', 'Lancie', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'who', 'up', 'three', 'films', 'Steel', 'Inferno', 'actor', 'looking', 'wife', 'burning', 'high-rise', 'What', 'Nice', 'Girl', 'Doing', 'Convention', 'San', 'Francisco', 'doctor', 'mimicking', 'roll', 'Dr.', 'Brackett', 'back', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'old', 'veterans', 'series', 'including', 'William', 'Boyett', 'Captain', 'Stanley', 'old', 'rival', 'Chief', 'McConnike', 'Vince', 'Howard', 'ever-present', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'County', 'Police', 'officer', 'are', 'also', 'hand', 'Final', 'Rescues', 'are', 'fine', 'capstone', 'influential', 'popular', 'series', 'was', 'best', 'time']",Emergency!

1205714,A1ZR7H9LU80VUC,B001JAHQ0M,"Bradley A. Beaupain ""US Video critic""","[6, 8]","The facts regarding some of the sequences and airings of the telefilms are incorrect.EDITED 1/26/11  First and foremost, ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"" was not originally aired during the season of all the telefilms, rather it was actually aired in December of 1976, about midway through season 6. It was different than the others in that the closing credits were similar to the end of the regular episodes with the paramedic badge. All the movies in the final season, had the end credits superimposed over the last scenes. Another reviewer stated that I was (possibly) confusing the re-airing of the pilot episode, which when repeated, was aired as an extended 2 part episode, but Roy and Johnny were not reminiscing as they are in this episode. I actually still have the old reel to reel that confirms this as it was a 2 hour time slot and there was a couple commercial breaks that included TV spots for King Kong (which opened in December of 1976) as well as other movies that were playing at the time. I also have an old Beta that has it repeated in December of 1977 (not 78 as listed in most online episode guides, this time with commercials for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which opened in Dec of 1977)  -- END OF CORRECTIONSThe Steel Inferno actually introduced us to another Squad and Station and featured only a few of the Doctors of RampartJulie London(Dixie McCall)and husband, Bobby Troup,(Joe Early) and I think Ron Pinkard wa also in it.(Dr. Morton).  The station is near the harbor and features two young paramedics, one of them is late coming back from a vacation with his fiancee (Anne Lockhart later of Battlestar Galactica ""Sheba"") A highrise building is still a few floors under construction and a careless paint crew starts the fire. There are a few sequences of Roy and John, but Engine 51 crew is not featured at all, and Roy and John are not the main duo in this film. Some footage sequences came from earlier Universal moviesAir date  1/7/78Survival on Charter #220 - This is the first 2 hour episode with more of John and Roy, sharing the time with their C shift counterparts. John and Roy respond to a call where a child, the daughter of a firefighter that was killed in the line of duty, was injured in a neighborhood game of baseball. While there, a plane carrying the governor of california (no not Arnold) collides with a small plane ( some of the effects and plot points are the SAME used and recycled from Universal's Airport 1975)and crashes in the same neighborhood that Roy and John are assisting the child, the squad is crushed, this is the last time the squad is seen in an emergency episode (it does not appear in any of the other telefims- remember, Greatest Rescues aires before any of the telefilms) Air date  3/25/78Most Deadly Passage  - Roy and John travel to Seattle Washington where they accompany the Seattle's station's Medic One crew to an accident in the Kingdome and observe when a skydiver gets medical attention after jumping off the Space Needle They also split up with the Medic One personnel and  venture out to the suburbs and watch as a cow gives birth and then assist the SFD in a major rescue when one of the ferry boats catches fire in the sound. Air date 4/4/78What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing?.......  Roy and John travel to San Francisco where they find that women are rising in the ranks of the SFFD as medics. Similar to Seattle, they are observing the practices of the medics in San Fran and there is another boat disaster.  Air Date 6/26/79The Convention -  Roy and John return to SFO and attend a Parmedic convention in SFO.  I don't remember this one other than there is a man who gets trapped in the riggings of a large boat and John and Roy reunite with the paremedics from their previous visit and tag along on some rescues. Air Date 7/3/79This is the correct sequence of the series telefilms. The Greatest Rescues of Emergency may have been re-aired on 12/31/78 as some TV episode guides suggest but it had first aired, as stated earlier,  in the 1976-1977 during the 6th season run.  In fact UNIVERSAL was asked why it was not included with Seaason 6 DVD set and although no answer was given, it was assumed that it would be more fitting to be included in the final DVD set which was not confirmed, but there was speculation that it would be a set containing all the telefilms.  Now lets hope its the actual 2 hr versions and not the syndicated 2 part versions. A few years back, a video company called JEMS, had released VHS tapes with the movies and different edits of some episodes.",4,"Emergency Telefilms in Season ""7""",1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,4570,"['facts', 'regarding', 'sequences', 'airings', 'telefilms', 'are', 'incorrect.EDITED', '1/26/11', 'First', 'foremost', 'Greatest', 'Rescues', 'Emergency', 'was', 'not', 'originally', 'aired', 'season', 'telefilms', 'rather', 'was', 'actually', 'aired', 'December', '1976', 'about', 'midway', 'season', '6', 'was', 'different', 'others', 'closing', 'credits', 'were', 'similar', 'end', 'regular', 'episodes', 'paramedic', 'badge', 'movies', 'final', 'season', 'had', 'end', 'credits', 'superimposed', 'last', 'scenes', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'was', 'possibly', 'confusing', 're-airing', 'pilot', 'episode', 'when', 'repeated', 'was', 'aired', 'extended', '2', 'part', 'episode', 'Roy', 'Johnny', 'were', 'not', 'reminiscing', 'are', 'episode', 'actually', 'still', 'have', 'old', 'reel', 'reel', 'was', '2', 'hour', 'time', 'slot', 'was', 'couple', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'included', 'TV', 'spots', 'King', 'Kong', 'opened', 'December', '1976', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'playing', 'time', 'also', 'have', 'old', 'Beta', 'repeated', 'December', '1977', 'not', '78', 'listed', 'most', 'online', 'episode', 'guides', 'time', 'commercials', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'opened', 'Dec', '1977', 'END', 'CORRECTIONSThe', 'Steel', 'Inferno', 'actually', 'introduced', 'Squad', 'Station', 'featured', 'only', 'few', 'Doctors', 'RampartJulie', 'London', 'Dixie', 'McCall', 'husband', 'Bobby', 'Troup', 'Joe', 'Early', 'think', 'Ron', 'Pinkard', 'wa', 'also', 'it.', 'Dr', 'Morton', 'station', 'harbor', 'features', 'two', 'young', 'paramedics', 'one', 'late', 'coming', 'back', 'vacation', 'fiancee', 'Anne', 'Lockhart', 'later', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Sheba', 'highrise', 'building', 'still', 'few', 'floors', 'construction', 'careless', 'paint', 'crew', 'fire', 'are', 'few', 'sequences', 'Roy', 'John', 'Engine', '51', 'crew', 'not', 'featured', 'Roy', 'John', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'duo', 'film', 'footage', 'sequences', 'came', 'earlier', 'Universal', 'moviesAir', 'date', '1/7/78Survival', 'Charter', '220', 'first', '2', 'hour', 'episode', 'more', 'John', 'Roy', 'sharing', 'time', 'C', 'shift', 'counterparts', 'John', 'Roy', 'respond', 'call', 'where', 'child', 'daughter', 'firefighter', 'was', 'killed', 'line', 'duty', 'was', 'injured', 'neighborhood', 'game', 'baseball', 'there', 'plane', 'carrying', 'governor', 'california', 'not', 'Arnold', 'small', 'plane', 'effects', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'SAME', 'used', 'recycled', 'Universal', 'Airport', '1975', 'crashes', 'same', 'neighborhood', 'Roy', 'John', 'are', 'assisting', 'child', 'squad', 'crushed', 'last', 'time', 'squad', 'seen', 'emergency', 'episode', 'not', 'appear', 'other', 'telefims-', 'remember', 'Greatest', 'Rescues', 'telefilms', 'Air', 'date', '3/25/78Most', 'Deadly', 'Passage', 'Roy', 'John', 'travel', 'Seattle', 'Washington', 'where', 'accompany', 'Seattle', 'station', 'Medic', 'One', 'crew', 'accident', 'Kingdome', 'observe', 'when', 'skydiver', 'medical', 'attention', 'jumping', 'off', 'Space', 'Needle', 'also', 'split', 'up', 'Medic', 'One', 'personnel', 'venture', 'suburbs', 'watch', 'cow', 'birth', 'then', 'assist', 'SFD', 'major', 'rescue', 'when', 'one', 'ferry', 'catches', 'fire', 'sound', 'Air', 'date', '4/4/78What', 'Nice', 'Girl', 'Doing', 'Roy', 'John', 'travel', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'find', 'women', 'are', 'rising', 'ranks', 'SFFD', 'medics', 'Similar', 'Seattle', 'are', 'observing', 'practices', 'medics', 'San', 'Fran', 'boat', 'disaster', 'Air', 'Date', '6/26/79The', 'Convention', 'Roy', 'John', 'return', 'SFO', 'attend', 'Parmedic', 'convention', 'SFO', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'one', 'other', 'man', 'who', 'trapped', 'riggings', 'large', 'boat', 'John', 'Roy', 'reunite', 'paremedics', 'previous', 'visit', 'tag', 'rescues', 'Air', 'Date', '7/3/79This', 'correct', 'sequence', 'series', 'telefilms', 'Greatest', 'Rescues', 'Emergency', 'may', 'have', 'been', 're-aired', '12/31/78', 'TV', 'episode', 'guides', 'suggest', 'had', 'first', 'aired', 'stated', 'earlier', '1976-1977', '6th', 'season', 'run', 'fact', 'UNIVERSAL', 'was', 'asked', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'Seaason', '6', 'DVD', 'set', 'answer', 'was', 'given', 'was', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'fitting', 'be', 'included', 'final', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'confirmed', 'there', 'was', 'speculation', 'would', 'be', 'set', 'containing', 'telefilms', 'Now', 'hope', 'actual', '2', 'hr', 'versions', 'not', 'syndicated', '2', 'part', 'versions', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'video', 'company', 'called', 'JEMS', 'had', 'released', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'movies', 'different', 'edits', 'episodes']",Emergency!

1205726,AJDOJANK50QJV,B001JAHQ0M,D. McSherry,"[26, 27]","This will complete the collection. I will pre-order this.I purchased ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"" on VHS when JEMS carried it.  You really see how Johnny and Roy worked together as partners, and after going through their adventures for six years, the bonding that took place. They looked out for each other, and worked as a team.  My favorite line is, ""Were going to be staying in touch with one another.  Right, it's not like we are moving out of town or anything.  We are still here, still in the same department, still friends.""  I was a little kid when I saw this episode on December 31, 1978, and nearly cried that Johnny and Roy were departing ways.About six years ago, a local independent showed re-runs, and I purposely stayed up late the week the movies were shown.  I felt OLD seeing the San Francisco EMS ambulances, because the manufacturer no longer makes those ""converted Winnebago ambulances"", and San Francisco EMS no longer exists - it merged into the San Francisco FD sometime in the 1990's.  Another part that made me laugh really hard was when the Haz-Mat unit showed up at the chemical explosion - that Hazardous Materials gear looked useless.I read that the idea was for R.A. Cinader to resurrect ""Emergency!"" at a different location, and the San Francisco movies were intended as pilots for a spin-off (unfortunately, NBC didn't pick it up).  The format of San Francisco seemed like a good place to do this, where the filming crew could spend a third of the time on Rescue (at the fire station), a third of the time at the hospital (note that John De Lancie from Star Trek played a doctor), and the rest on the ambulance.  I remember the discussion of navigating San Francisco streets, which are narrow and hilly.  I would think a medium duty truck size ambulance body (International or Freightliner) today would have a hard time, but a Ford E450 Type III would probably be OK.The Seattle movie was good too, although I felt OLD at the King Dome rescue - since the King Dome was imploded sometime in the 1990's.  This was also before Starbucks and Microsoft took off in Seattle too - 500,000 population in 1978. I was also glad to see that Harborview was mentioned , since Seattle got the Medic One program up and running in 1969. During that episode, I appreciated the discussion on the ""tiered system"", when Rocky and Swede explained to Johnny and Roy the difference between the Aid Units (BLS) and the Medic Units (ALS). Rocky and Swede served on a Medic Unit, and this discussion was probably intended to explain the ""tiered system"" to the audience, since different cities do different things.  My current city runs fire department ALS ambulances (paramedic engine companies are around too - most cities in the past 20 years have implemented them), and the paramedic program didn't start here until circa 1974.  Several cities (like Fort Worth, Pittsburgh, and Boston) currently run third service EMS transport, much like San Francisco did until 1997.The Journal of Emergency Medical Services (JEMS) has a DVD titled The History of Modern EMS:  Making a Difference 2.0 that can be found for purchase.

1205727,ABN99Q8LIWVEK,B001JAHQ0M,"D. Pauley ""Splankna""","[169, 179]","Warning:  some possible spoilers in this review.After Emergency! finished its 6 year TV episode run, the show then had 6 ""made for TV"" movies that were released in 1978 (the year following the last season of Emergency!) and 1979.  So, technically, this is not ""Season 7"", although there is about 12 hrs. worth of programming on this set.  It would be cool if they released the Emergency +4 cartoons with this final movie set - but I seriously doubt that will happen.These movies included:""Survival on Charter 220"" - where a small plane collides mid air with a larger passenger jet.  They land in a neighbor and the havoc ensues.  If I'm not mistaken, Squad 51 is crushed by a part of a plane and Johnny and Roy are trapped inside a house. (2 hr. movie)""The Steele Inferno"" - basically a high rise building fire stretched into a 2 hr. movie.""What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing?"" - Johnny and Roy travel to San Francisco. (2 hr. movie)""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"" - Johnny and Roy are promoted to Captain and reminisce about their days on the squad.  The movie is made up mostly of flashback scenes from the TV series, but it is still nice to see Johnny and Roy promoted to Captain (2 hr. movie)""Most Deadly Passage"" - Johnny and Roy travel to Seattle (2 hr. movie)""The Convention"" - Johnny and Roy return to San Francisco (2 hr. movie)For those who have never seen these two hr. movies, be forewarned that you don't see A LOT of Johnny and Roy in most of these movies (with the exception of ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"" - where you see A LOT of Johnny and Roy - but this ""movie"" consists mostly flashbacks).  In fact, there are a number of very long segments in the other movies with no Johnny and Roy.  Some of the movies almost come across like they were trying to create a spin off series - because so LITTLE time is spent with Johnny and Roy and so much time is spent with new characters.  Further, you won't be seeing any of the other fireman from the series on these TV movies - so no Chet, no Cap, no Marco.  You do get to see the Rampart medical staff a bit.Personally, I am not very fond of these TV movies (with the exception of ""Greatest Rescues"").  Remember, when I say this, I am a HUGE Emergency! fan.  I grew up watching the TV show.  I owned a Squad 51 helmet, an Emergency! Jigsaw puzzle, etc. and soon all of the TV seasons on DVD (as soon as Season 6 comes out).  I personally met Randolph Mantooth in 2001 (along with other crew members from the show) when Code 3 Collectibles was dedicating their new Emergency! toys at Station 127 in Carson (the station used for the TV series) - got to sit in the refurbished squad.  I have visited the station 3 times in the last several years.  This is my favorite show of all time (along with the Saint and Mission Impossible) - but these TV movies, honestly, put me to sleep.  In my opinion, they are slow moving and have too little of our favorite cast from the series.  I will probably buy this set to complete the series, but IMHO, you aren't missing much if you don't own them - but perhaps some of you enjoyed these movies.While these final movies haven't been released yet, don't expect much in the video quality if the last few seasons are any indication.Hope this ""preview"" or review helps.

Partly my fault, I didn't read the information about the disc set or the reviews, I just thought, hey another season of the show I grew up watching each week, then over and over while it was in syndication. I had thought it would be a few more hour long episodes, not a bunch of mini-movies that mostly did not even involve any real action with Johnny and Roy, and nothing with the original 51 cast from both the station and at Rampart, which while the focus was on Roy and Johnny, most of the mini-movies hardly focused on their efforts at all, with the exception of the mini-movie recounting of some of the more famous Emergency rescues that Johnny and Roy were in, but like the rest of you, I am sure you recall most of those rescues/fires, I did. But, that mini-movie was really the only one that interested me mainly because of them bothing parting ways as captains and reliving the best and worst times between they had together, and you could see the cameraderie they both shared at the end of that 4th mini-movie.  The boat and dome rescue in Seattle was a joke, Roy and Johnny hardly even got to do anything because they were just there to 'observe'.All in all sadly to say, not worth the money, except possibly just for the one famous rescues mini-movie if you want to pay approx. $30 just for that one.",2,Not what I thought it would be...,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,1442,"['watching', '6', 'seasons', 'Emergency', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'same', 'Station', '51', 'was', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'Partly', 'fault', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'information', 'disc', 'set', 'reviews', 'just', 'thought', 'hey', 'season', 'show', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'week', 'then', 'was', 'syndication', 'had', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'few', 'more', 'hour', 'long', 'episodes', 'not', 'bunch', 'mini-movies', 'mostly', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'involve', 'real', 'action', 'Johnny', 'Roy', 'nothing', 'original', '51', 'cast', 'station', 'Rampart', 'focus', 'was', 'Roy', 'Johnny', 'most', 'mini-movies', 'hardly', 'focused', 'efforts', 'exception', 'mini-movie', 'recounting', 'more', 'famous', 'Emergency', 'rescues', 'Johnny', 'Roy', 'were', 'rest', 'am', 'sure', 'recall', 'most', 'rescues/fires', 'did', 'mini-movie', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'interested', 'mainly', 'bothing', 'parting', 'ways', 'captains', 'reliving', 'best', 'worst', 'times', 'had', 'together', 'could', 'see', 'cameraderie', 'shared', 'end', '4th', 'mini-movie', 'boat', 'dome', 'rescue', 'Seattle', 'was', 'joke', 'Roy', 'Johnny', 'hardly', 'even', 'got', 'do', 'anything', 'were', 'just', 'there', ""'observe'.All"", 'sadly', 'say', 'not', 'money', 'possibly', 'just', 'one', 'famous', 'rescues', 'mini-movie', 'want', 'pay', 'approx', '30', 'just', 'one']",Emergency!

And my collection would not be complete without the final chapter in the lives of my favorite fiefighter/paramedics, John Gage and Roy DeSoto.Luckily, there was &#34;closure&#34; to the series, unlike other series of the day or even today. The main reason that there were even these two-hour movies with Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy DeSoto (Kevin TIghe) was due to the fact that the studio had a contractual obligation to both actors. The series ran for 6 seasons and their studio contracts were for 7. The studio came up with the idea of 6 two-hour movies that would complete the series. For the actors, at least but not necessarily for the fans.The 6 two-hour movies included touches of the then current genre of disaster movies. The first being: &#34;The Steel Inferno.&#34; The second being: &#34;Survival on Charter #220.&#34; Both paid homage to the big 1970's disaster movies, &#34;The Towering Inferno&#34; and &#34;Airport '75&#34;.The complete movie titles on the DVD are:&#34;The Steel Inferno&#34;, aired on January 7, 1978.&#34;Survival on Charter #220&#34;, aired on March 25, 1978.&#34;Most Deadly Passage&#34;, aired on April 4, 1978.&#34;Greatest Rescues of Emergency!&#34;, aired on December 31, 1978.&#34;What's A Nice Girl Like You Doing...&#34;, aired on June 26, 1979.&#34;The Convention&#34;, aired on July 3, 1979.All of the movies are entertaining but in the last 2, Johnny and Roy are just observers and don't perform any real rescues like on the series.But to get your &#34;Emergency!&#34; &#34;fix&#34;, this DVD will work.

It contains LOTS of fire-figthing action and rescue scenes. The fire sequences were actually BETTER than those in Towering Inferno in my opinion! It appears they had a good budget to work with, and made the fire scenes VERY realistic. And you only have to wait 20 minutes for the major action to start.""Survival on Charter #220"" wastes over an hour's time before the action kicks in. Too much fluff and uninteresting material here. Once the planes crash, then things get interesting.""Most Deadly Passage"", where Roy & Johnny visit the Seattle Fire Department to compare their paramedic program to the L.A. County's program spends too much time with personal stuff and unexciting rescues at the Kingdome and Space Needle [not an actual rescue at that]. The Ferry boat fire is a letdown in my opinion.""Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"" is a bunch of flashbacks of Roy & Johnny from previous seasons while being promoted to Captains. Nothing much new or exciting here.""What's a Nice Girl Like You?"" is the first of two movies filmed in San Francisco, and spends most of the time following the actions of a S.F.F.D. fire station crew and two female paramedics before a major fire on a pier, which is fairly exciting.The last film,The Convention, has Roy & Johnny returning to San Francisco, and following around the same cast from the last movie. This time, the final fire is a big explosion at a chemical lab working with toxic chemicals & radioactive materials. This was the best action since the fire in ""Steel Inferno"".If you are expecting to see lots of Roy & Johnny, you will be disappointed.  Engine 51 does not appear at all. The staff at Rampart appears in the first two movies, but their roles are rather limited, with no real drama for them to deal with.Personally, I like this set of t.v. movies for ""Steel Inferno"", the airplane crash / fires, and the fire at the end of ""Convention"".If you are looking to relive the ""true"" Emergency! series, you may be let down.However, if you want lots of action, and are less concerned with who is involved in it, you may really enjoy some of these ""movies""...especially ""Steel Inferno""...sort of a ""mini Towering Inferno"".",4,"Emergency ""Made for T.V.""

1205774,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001JAHQ0M,trebe,"[1, 2]","After the NBC series Emergency was cancelled after its sixth season, the program returned for six, 2 hour, made for TV movie specials, broadcast during 1978, and 1979.  These six adventures, are featured in Emergency: The Final Rescues, a two disc set.While the fire fighting and rescues scenarios featured in these movies will seem familiar to those acquainted with the series, the focus of these adventures is very different from the original series.  While LA Fire Department paramedics John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe), remain the central characters, none of the original members of Squad 51 appear in these movies, except in flashbacks.  The characters associated with Rampart General Hospital, are present live in only the first two of the specials.While the dynamic between Johnny and Roy is mostly intact, they are for the most part, functioning in different and unfamiliar environments.  For some fans, the new perspectives on these characters will be interesting, while others may be yearning for the old familiar Squad 51/Rampart situation.  With DeSoto and Gage interacting with what are a series of strangers, and often in the role of visiting observers, there is a bit of a disconnect with the action, and the same kind of camaraderie and teamwork that was present in the TV series, isn't quite there.As Emergency had already been cancelled, coming back with more of the same probably did not make much sense, even so, some of the stories do venture away from what made Emergency a success, and get involved in the personal lives of some of the guest stars.  While the ""heart"" found in the original series may be lacking, the technical aspects and special effects remain exceptionally solid.  The fires are real, and buildings and other structures, are really burning.  Working with explosives and fire, there is always an element of danger, and Emergency has always done a stellar job of dramatizing fire rescue situations.Some of the stories may seem really familiar, ""borrowing"" elements from familiar sources, like The Towering Inferno, and Airport `75.  ""Most Deadly Passage"" features the paramedics facing a crisis on the water while in Seattle, and in the ""Greatest Rescues of Emergency"", DeSoto and Gage are promoted to the rank of Captain, and then reminisce over a series of excerpts from the series.The final two movies are set in San Francisco, where Gage and DeSoto work with the same group of emergency personnel, including two female paramedics.  It's a great setting, and the productions make good use of locations like the Golden Gate Bridge, and the waterfront areas.  With no official standing, the LA paramedics have little control over what happens, but still manage to get involved in some action.  With nearly 100 minutes to fill, lots of attention is given to personal issues, but when the action does occur, there are some spectacular explosions, and huge fires involving chemicals and other hazardous materials.  Under fire, during a police standoff, Roy and Johnny help deliver a baby.Although The Final Rescues do not have the same tone of the original series, and John Gage and Roy DeSoto are somewhat removed from the frontlines, diehard fans may want to see how they finished their distinguished careers.  Emergency was a program that was entertaining and exciting, but it was also concerned with furthering the development of the then fledgling paramedic program.  Our current EMS programs, probably owe Emergency some debt, for supporting and raising public awareness of the paramedic program, in the early days of its existence.  And who knows how many viewers, were influenced to become firemen or paramedics, because of the series.",4,"the last adventures of Johnny and Roy, finds them removed from the frontlines...",1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,3707,"['NBC', 'series', 'Emergency', 'was', 'cancelled', 'sixth', 'season', 'program', 'returned', 'six', '2', 'hour', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'specials', 'broadcast', '1978', '1979', 'six', 'adventures', 'are', 'featured', 'Emergency', 'Final', 'Rescues', 'two', 'disc', 'fire', 'fighting', 'rescues', 'scenarios', 'featured', 'movies', 'will', 'seem', 'familiar', 'acquainted', 'series', 'focus', 'adventures', 'very', 'different', 'original', 'series', 'LA', 'Fire', 'Department', 'paramedics', 'John', 'Gage', 'Randolph', 'Mantooth', 'Roy', 'DeSoto', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'remain', 'central', 'characters', 'none', 'original', 'members', 'Squad', '51', 'appear', 'movies', 'flashbacks', 'characters', 'associated', 'Rampart', 'General', 'Hospital', 'are', 'present', 'live', 'only', 'first', 'two', 'specials.While', 'dynamic', 'Johnny', 'Roy', 'mostly', 'intact', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'functioning', 'different', 'unfamiliar', 'environments', 'fans', 'new', 'perspectives', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'yearning', 'old', 'familiar', 'Squad', '51/Rampart', 'situation', 'DeSoto', 'Gage', 'interacting', 'are', 'series', 'strangers', 'often', 'role', 'visiting', 'observers', 'bit', 'disconnect', 'action', 'same', 'kind', 'camaraderie', 'teamwork', 'was', 'present', 'TV', 'series', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there.As', 'Emergency', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'cancelled', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'same', 'probably', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'even', 'so', 'stories', 'do', 'venture', 'away', 'what', 'made', 'Emergency', 'success', 'get', 'involved', 'personal', 'lives', 'guest', 'stars', 'heart', 'found', 'original', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'lacking', 'technical', 'aspects', 'special', 'effects', 'remain', 'exceptionally', 'solid', 'fires', 'are', 'real', 'buildings', 'other', 'structures', 'are', 'really', 'burning', 'Working', 'explosives', 'fire', 'always', 'element', 'danger', 'Emergency', 'always', 'done', 'stellar', 'job', 'dramatizing', 'fire', 'rescue', 'situations.Some', 'stories', 'may', 'seem', 'really', 'familiar', 'borrowing', 'elements', 'familiar', 'sources', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'Airport', '75', 'Most', 'Deadly', 'Passage', 'paramedics', 'facing', 'crisis', 'water', 'Seattle', 'Greatest', 'Rescues', 'Emergency', 'DeSoto', 'Gage', 'are', 'promoted', 'rank', 'Captain', 'then', 'reminisce', 'series', 'excerpts', 'series.The', 'final', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'set', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'Gage', 'DeSoto', 'work', 'same', 'group', 'emergency', 'personnel', 'including', 'two', 'female', 'paramedics', 'great', 'setting', 'productions', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'locations', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'waterfront', 'areas', 'official', 'standing', 'LA', 'paramedics', 'have', 'little', 'control', 'what', 'still', 'manage', 'get', 'involved', 'action', 'nearly', '100', 'minutes', 'fill', 'lots', 'attention', 'given', 'personal', 'issues', 'when', 'action', 'occur', 'are', 'spectacular', 'explosions', 'huge', 'fires', 'involving', 'chemicals', 'other', 'hazardous', 'materials', 'fire', 'police', 'standoff', 'Roy', 'Johnny', 'help', 'deliver', 'Final', 'Rescues', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'tone', 'original', 'series', 'John', 'Gage', 'Roy', 'DeSoto', 'are', 'somewhat', 'removed', 'frontlines', 'diehard', 'fans', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'finished', 'distinguished', 'careers', 'Emergency', 'was', 'program', 'was', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'was', 'also', 'concerned', 'furthering', 'development', 'then', 'fledgling', 'paramedic', 'program', 'current', 'EMS', 'programs', 'probably', 'owe', 'Emergency', 'debt', 'supporting', 'raising', 'public', 'awareness', 'paramedic', 'program', 'early', 'days', 'existence', 'who', 'how', 'many', 'viewers', 'were', 'influenced', 'become', 'firemen', 'paramedics', 'series']",Emergency!

There were three things going on at once here.First, after six seasons what sort of rescue hadn't these guys done?  That episode in season six where the guys play basketball for about twenty minutes was the shark-jumper.  I imagine the cast and crew were up for trying something new at that point.Second, in the mid-seventies cable TV hadn't taken off yet, so the networks were not only competing with each other, but also with movie theaters, especially on the weekends.  Their biggest weapon in this battle was the TV movie, which was usually mediocre, but had the virtue of being free.And in the mid-seventies TV nearly did kill off cinemas in the US.  Westerns were dead and during the VietNam era war movies were out of fashion.  This left Hollywood macho with few options, thus the disaster movie was born.  It started with ""Airport"" in 1970, which divided like a bacteria to produce Airport '75, Airport '77, and Airport '79.  One of the biggest disaster flicks was ""The Towering Inferno"" in 1974.These disaster movies were very formulaic.  You spend an hour getting to know (and either love or hate) the innocent bystanders, then - WHAM!  Disaster strikes, and for the rest of the film the audience plays ""Guess Who Croaks.""  You can see why Star Wars was such a big deal.Anyway, ""The Steel Inferno"" and ""Survival on Charter 220"" clearly follow the disaster film plan.  Roy and Johnny have to take a back seat so the victims' characters can be developed.  This is disappointing, but the emergency response action scenes are as good as ever.As an Emergency! fan, this is the last of the DVD sets I would buy.",3,A Product of its Time,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,1679,"['How', 'weekly', 'TV', 'series', 'morph', 'handful', 'TV', 'movies', 'were', 'three', 'things', 'going', 'once', 'here.First', 'six', 'seasons', 'what', 'sort', 'rescue', 'had', ""n't"", 'guys', 'done', 'episode', 'season', 'six', 'where', 'guys', 'play', 'basketball', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'shark-jumper', 'imagine', 'cast', 'crew', 'were', 'up', 'trying', 'something', 'new', 'point.Second', 'mid-seventies', 'cable', 'TV', 'had', ""n't"", 'taken', 'off', 'yet', 'networks', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'competing', 'other', 'also', 'movie', 'theaters', 'especially', 'weekends', 'biggest', 'weapon', 'battle', 'was', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'usually', 'mediocre', 'had', 'virtue', 'being', 'free.And', 'mid-seventies', 'TV', 'nearly', 'did', 'kill', 'off', 'cinemas', 'US', 'Westerns', 'were', 'dead', 'VietNam', 'era', 'war', 'movies', 'were', 'fashion', 'left', 'Hollywood', 'macho', 'few', 'options', 'thus', 'disaster', 'movie', 'was', 'born', 'started', 'Airport', '1970', 'divided', 'bacteria', 'produce', 'Airport', ""'75"", 'Airport', ""'77"", 'Airport', ""'79"", 'One', 'biggest', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'was', 'Towering', 'Inferno', '1974.These', 'disaster', 'movies', 'were', 'very', 'formulaic', 'spend', 'hour', 'getting', 'know', 'love', 'hate', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'then', 'WHAM', 'Disaster', 'strikes', 'rest', 'film', 'audience', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Croaks', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Star', 'Wars', 'was', 'big', 'deal.Anyway', 'Steel', 'Inferno', 'Survival', 'Charter', '220', 'clearly', 'follow', 'disaster', 'film', 'plan', 'Roy', 'Johnny', 'have', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'victims', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'developed', 'disappointing', 'emergency', 'response', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'ever.As', 'Emergency', 'fan', 'last', 'DVD', 'sets', 'would', 'buy']",Emergency!
