862153,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00067BBLY,Annie Van Auken,"[4, 4]","DE-LOVELY: THE COLE PORTER STORY (USA/UK-2004) is a bit slow-moving but has a unique premise. The elderly Cole sits in a theater and watches his songwriting career and personal life presented as a stageplay, starting when he's an unknown in Paris who knocks off catchy tunes and witty lyrics for the amusement of his friends.Irving Berlin convinces him to go professional and with the encouragement of his beloved Linda, Porter returns to the U.S. to score a play called ""Paris."" Success in this first effort brings him fame and fortune and what should've been an ideal life, but wasn't.For Cole, his 35 year marriage to Linda Lee was a profound yet platonic relationship, as his physical needs could only be satisfied by various male lovers. Linda was so devoted to him she put up with these affairs and even encouraged them, but they hurt her enough to cause separations. Unlike the sanitized Cary Grant biopicNIGHT AND DAY(1946), the Porters' intimate business is explored in some depth here.There's some interesting casting choices in this movie. Ashley Judd is quite good as Linda. Kevin Kline (like Cole) has a terrible singing voice and is appropriately laid back. The accomplished Welsh-born stage actor Jonathan Pryce is director of Cole's life story. He sits with Porter and listens to the songwriter's thoughts on what he's seeing or how the ""play"" might be improved.Allan Corduner, who is so good as Sir Arthur Sullivan inTOPSY-TURVY(UK-1999), portrays Cole's close friend from his Yale days, Monty Woolley. The demonstrative Woolley (aka ""the Beard"") left that university's theatrical professorship at age 50 to return to the stage, where he found fame as THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER. Woolley reprised this parody of Broadway critic Alex Woollcott in the1942 motion picture version.Corduner's Monty is an impish adventure seeker with a taste in lovers similar to Porter's. In one scene, after he sets up a meeting for Cole with a young ballet star, Woolley departs from their horse-drawn carriage to search NY's Central Park for his own excitement.Except for Sheryl Crow's oddly minor key rendition of ""Begin the Beguine,"" all of this picture's musical sequences are (naturally) De-lightful. Among the 2 dozen Porter standards heard are the title song plus ""What is This Thing Called Love,"" ""Easy to Love,"" ""Night and Day,"" ""Another Openin', Another Show,"" ""I Love Paris,"" ""Let's Misbehave,"" ""Anything Goes,"" ""Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love,"" ""Be a Clown,"" ""Just One of Those Things,"" ""I Get a Kick out of You,"" ""True Love,"" ""In the Still of the Night,"" ""You're the Top,"" ""It's All Right with Me"" and the uncensored ""Well Did You Evah!""Performers include Elvis Costello, Natalie Cole, Alanis Morissette, Diana Krall and Robbie Williams.DE-LOVELY is recommended for all who enjoy great 20th Century American show tunes.",4,"""It's de-regal, it's de-royal, it's de-Ritz, it's de-lovely.""",1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2831,"['DE-LOVELY', 'COLE', 'PORTER', 'STORY', 'USA/UK-2004', 'bit', 'slow-moving', 'unique', 'premise', 'elderly', 'Cole', 'sits', 'theater', 'songwriting', 'career', 'personal', 'life', 'presented', 'stageplay', 'starting', 'when', 'unknown', 'Paris', 'who', 'off', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'witty', 'lyrics', 'amusement', 'friends.Irving', 'Berlin', 'convinces', 'go', 'professional', 'encouragement', 'beloved', 'Linda', 'Porter', 'U.S.', 'score', 'play', 'called', 'Paris', 'Success', 'first', 'effort', 'fame', 'fortune', 'what', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'ideal', 'life', ""wasn't.For"", 'Cole', '35', 'year', 'marriage', 'Linda', 'Lee', 'was', 'profound', 'yet', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'physical', 'needs', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'satisfied', 'various', 'male', 'lovers', 'Linda', 'was', 'so', 'devoted', 'put', 'up', 'affairs', 'even', 'encouraged', 'hurt', 'enough', 'cause', 'separations', 'sanitized', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'biopicNIGHT', 'AND', 'DAY', '1946', 'Porters', 'intimate', 'business', 'explored', 'depth', 'interesting', 'casting', 'choices', 'movie', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'quite', 'good', 'Linda', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Cole', 'terrible', 'singing', 'voice', 'appropriately', 'laid', 'back', 'accomplished', 'Welsh-born', 'stage', 'actor', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'director', 'Cole', 'life', 'story', 'Porter', 'songwriter', 'thoughts', 'what', 'seeing', 'how', 'play', 'might', 'be', 'improved.Allan', 'Corduner', 'who', 'so', 'good', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Sullivan', 'inTOPSY-TURVY', 'UK-1999', 'Cole', 'close', 'friend', 'Yale', 'days', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'demonstrative', 'Woolley', 'Beard', 'left', 'university', 'theatrical', 'professorship', 'age', '50', 'return', 'stage', 'where', 'found', 'fame', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'CAME', 'TO', 'DINNER', 'Woolley', 'reprised', 'parody', 'Broadway', 'critic', 'Alex', 'Woollcott', 'the1942', 'motion', 'picture', 'version.Corduner', 'Monty', 'impish', 'adventure', 'seeker', 'taste', 'lovers', 'similar', 'Porter', 'one', 'scene', 'up', 'meeting', 'Cole', 'young', 'ballet', 'star', 'Woolley', 'departs', 'horse-drawn', 'carriage', 'search', 'NY', 'Central', 'Park', 'own', 'excitement.Except', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'oddly', 'minor', 'key', 'rendition', 'Begin', 'Beguine', 'picture', 'musical', 'sequences', 'are', 'naturally', 'De-lightful', '2', 'dozen', 'Porter', 'standards', 'heard', 'are', 'title', 'song', 'What', 'Thing', 'Called', 'Love', 'Easy', 'Love', 'Night', 'Day', 'Openin', 'Show', 'Love', 'Paris', 'Let', 'Misbehave', 'Anything', 'Goes', 'Let', 'Do', 'Let', 'Fall', 'Love', 'Be', 'Clown', 'Just', 'One', 'Things', 'Get', 'Kick', 'True', 'Love', 'Still', 'Night', ""'re"", 'Top', 'Right', 'Me', 'uncensored', 'Well', 'Did', 'Evah', 'Performers', 'include', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Natalie', 'Cole', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'Robbie', 'Williams.DE-LOVELY', 'recommended', 'who', 'enjoy', 'great', '20th', 'Century', 'American', 'show', 'tunes']",N/A

He wrote so many tunes, ones I've heard and loved all my life, and those selected for this movie were great---many done with updated renditions by current artists.The movie begins when an aged Porter is summoned by a director to view the rehearsal for a play based on his life.  The story unfolds in a series of theatrical scenes beginning with his love-at-first-sight romance with Linda and his lifelong devotion to her.  Also highlighted is his bisexual lifestyle which she accepts amazingly well as long as it doesn't become a public scandal.  Kevin Kline is outstanding as the young and dashing Porter as well as the aged and defeated man.  Ashley Judd shines as the loving mate who guides his career and his recovery from a horrific accident.But it is the music that steals the show, the lyrics and melodies that have endured for years and will remain firmly entrenched as pop standards long past the 20th century.  Songs such as ""De-Lovely,"" ""Let's Misbehave,"" ""Night and Day,"" ""Anything Goes,"" ""You're the Top,"" and my personal favorite ""Every Time We Say Goodbye"" are done with the style and grace worthy of Cole Porter and performed by such varied artists as Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette, Natalie Cole and others including Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd.

It's life shown even at it's weakest moments-- his wife losing a baby and Cole being thrown from a horse and having serious problems with his legs afterwards, making it hard to use the piano pedals.This film is so poignant and lovely in every aspect. We get plenty of musical numbers of marvelous Cole Porter tunes, sung by wonderful guest stars, including Robbie Williams, Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello, and Alanis Morissette.

862158,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00067BBLY,Benjamin,"[2, 4]","My main problem with ""De-Lovely"" has nothing to do with the acting, the music or the way that director Irwin Winkler has chosen to present the material.Kevin Kline is excellent in this movie, and Ashley Judd gives her best performance in years, which isn't really saying much. The music is excellent, though it's occasionally obtrusive in the movie.The ""It's a Wonderful Life"" story device used to tell the story is a bit odd, to be honest. In it, the aged Cole Porter is commanded by some sort of visiting angel or ""director,"" played eerily by Jonathan Pryce, to tell the story of his life. So, occasionally, the entire natural story stops, allowing for aged Cole to interfere or intervene in the way his life is going.My main problem, I fear, has to do with the arrangement behind the marriage of Cole and Linda Lee Porter, which is not the movie's fault at all.I'm bugged by the fact that Linda Lee marries Cole knowing full well that he's gay - yet much of the movie is devoted to how it's difficult for her to live with this choice. When she sees him devoted to another man, she moves them to another country, even though she knew he was gay to begin with. It's like she's a hanger-on, even though he didn't love her the way she needed to be loved. There's was a marriage-of-convenience, not of romantic love.There are too many shots of Linda looking disappointed that her husband is cavorting with men, even though she knew before they married what he did.Linda herself admits to not much liking men. Her first husband, according to the movie, abused her, so her marriage to Cole, one of ""respect,"" is without passion.The entire movie is about their compromise, and it's difficult to watch or determine what exactly we as an audience are supposed to feel about it.Either Cole is horrible for cheating on his wife with her permission. Or Linda is silly for intentionally entering into a loveless marriage to someone who is actually a very dear friend who cares for her intimately.See it for the music. See it for the acting.

862160,A48THA5X4OUAB,B00067BBLY,Billyjack D'Urberville,"[5, 6]","This film is an entertaining and surrealistic look at the life and music of Cole Porter, containing one of the very best of Kevin Kline's many great performances.  It is engrossing and well worth viewing, but admittedly somewhat emotionally draining despite the exciting music and beauteous sets.  It does demand a little something of the audience, which is doubtless why some are putting it down.Simply, the movie is trying to do a  lot of things at once -- entertain, inform, and chronicle a life and an era -- and in doing so it pushes the edge a little.  It mostly succeeds, but the number of very interesting cut scenes supplied on this DVD is instructive on how complex the juggling act was, and how close some of the calls were.It must be kept in mind that the film does not set out to convey Porter's days in documentary realism and reportage.  Rather, as a portrait of an artist, it enters the subconscious, aiming at overall psychological realism first, documentary accuracy second.  So realism, despite the big Hollywood production, is just a tool in the bag of tricks, just like Dali could paint a human figure or a landscape like a Dutch master, even as he broke many rules.  The strange emotional space of the film is also not very directly signalled, which also leaves some viewers ajar.  It probably resembles the dreamscape of Hitchcock's Vertigo more than anything seen on the screen for a long time.

The key element of the movie was the intense love between Cole and Linda, a love that seems as true as can be, although it was an unconventional love.  The devotion of each of them to each other, each in their own way, seemed almost too good to be true, but that really doesn't matter.  It was a beautiful pairing,, against the backdrop of the most beautiful and clever songs written in the past century.  That is yet another draw, the beautiful songs that Cole Porter wrote.  Where are the beautiful songs now?  How many decades has it been since we can admire a song, relate to its meaning, even just understand the words.  For me, the nostalgia for the songs and that time was no less rewarding than anything else in the movie.  For those over 50, you should enjoy the songs as much as I do, and if you are under 50, you can hear what you have not had an opportunity to enjoy, at least not in real time.

I was told that Nelson Eddy (or rather a composite thereof) was portrayed in the film. The actor was in a Mountie uniform, singing ""I Love You"". Two strikes right there--the song was not in Rose Marie, and Nelson never sang it in a film. (Porter wrote ""In The Still of The Night"" and title song for ""Rosalie"", which starred Nelson.)  However, since this was my first look and listen to Mick Hucknall portraying ""Mr. Nelson"" the film deserves a small thumbs up--Just for Mick! Kevin Kline appeared to have little chemistry with Ashley Judd--who incidentally was lovely in the film, but then he was gay so I expected to see some glimmer of passion with his male friends. Nothing much there either. The music was good, some of the best songs were left out, though. The scenery and settings showed off the 20s and 30s very well, but the story was a bust.

At least it was considerably more honest about Porter's married and sex lives (they weren't the same) than the grotesque Night and Day. On the plus side was Porter's songs, lots lof them, and performed well by singers like Elvis Costello and Sheryl Crow, who don't come to mind as Porter specialists. And there is the job by Kevin Kline, one of the most skilled and likeable actors around. Ashley Judd did, I thought, a good job in a fairly thankless role.The movie, to me, seemed leaden, with the direction heavy footed. Almost every meaningful moment that arose was underlined by an obvious song, or lighting, or staging. The framing device with Jonathan Pryce didn't work for me; it was too much ""and then you did"" kind of a thing. Pryce, who has great song-and-dance skills, was completely wasted. The brief look at him strutting his stuff at the end was way too short. And I couldn't decide if they were trying to make the old Porter look like Rod Steiger or Carl Reiner.Then there is the matter of Porter's personality. Even his most complimentary biographers allow that he was a superficial, condescending social snob. He was witty and charming with those he considered his equals in ""society"" and those with whom he worked in the theater. But he thought nothing of humiliating or being publicly rude to those he thought didn't meet his social standards. At any rate, the personal angst of the rich and famous have never touched me deeply...even when J Lo and Ben broke up.I give the movie high marks for Kline, the songs and the star performers, but I thought the rest of it was too heavy handed. I'll admit, though, that I may get the DVD; if I do it will be for the song performances.(If you're interested in seeing a top notch musical biography, check out Topsy-Turvy.

For every De-Lovely, Hollywood seems to crank out hundreds of shoot-em-up explosion spectaculars, teen sex comedies, star vehicles for gangster rappers, and depressing, nihilistic ""independent"" films for the intelligentsia.De-Lovely is everything these films are not.  It is a great musical in the ""they don't make `em like that any more"" sense, a poignantly heartwarming love story with true emotional depth (and a twist), a celebration of life and happiness (as well as a recognition and understanding of life's tragedies), and a star vehicle for two truly talented actor/singers, Kevin Klein and Ashley Judd, plus a plethora of cameo appearances by currently popular singers (including Elvis Costello, Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow and Natalie Cole) who obviously are singing their songs more for love (of Cole Porter) than money.As depicted in De-Lovely, Cole Porter possessed more joie-de-vivre than perhaps any man in history, and he wrote his songs straight from the heart.  The first part of the film, corresponding to the first half of Porter's adult life, appears to be all peaches and cream, and I was prepared simply to enjoy an upbeat musical.  Porter enters into a nearly perfect (for him) relationship with his wife Linda, that allows him his dalliances and to remain true to his self, but also to, over time, experience the depths of true love with a life's partner.  It is the second half of the film, when the Porter's must overcome multiple tragedies, that elevate De-Lovely to a truly noteworthy film, by showing a deep understanding of love and humanity.Kevin Klein and Ashley Judd give great performances.  Klein has the most challenging role, as he must sing, dance, and act through a broad range of emotions, as well as age over the course of 40 or 50 years (by the way, the make-up work which aged the actors is very good - it must be amazing for Klein and Judd to see what they may look like in their 60s or 70s).  I wouldn't be surprised to see Oscar nominations for Klein (especially) and Judd, if this film reaches a broad enough audience.  My quibbles with the film are minor (some abrupt transitions, and some garbled dialogue), and are far outweighed by the many positives.Surprisingly, the major movie critics have ranged all over the ""love/hate"" spectrum in their reviews of De-Lovely (check out the metacritic web site to see for yourself).  I think the reaction to the film is primarily a function of the state of mind of the reviewer, i.e. subjectivity dominates objectivity.  I am flabbergasted that the Village Voice reviewer could call this film ""overwhelmingly glum"".  I wonder what this reviewer thought of ""Sid & Nancy"", which I would say is the antithesis of De-Lovely?If modern pop culture has not yet turned you into a complete cynic, if you have any appreciation at all for music of the Jazz Age, big bands, or crooners such as Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Mel Torme, or (today) Harry Connick Jr., if you have a romantic bone in your body, if you enjoy traditional Hollywood or Broadway musicals or a great love story, then I think you will find De-Lovely definitely delightful!",5,De-Lovely delightful?

862171,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00067BBLY,Deborah Earle,"[3, 4]","Whether he is playing an agressive, swashbuckling, song-filled Pirate King, a fatally and glamourously insane Jewish chemist living in Brooklyn with his death-camp surviving Polish lover and writer friend, someone reuniting with college friends to deal with a suicide, a journalist exposing injustice in a repressive land, or hamming it up as a participant in a diamond heist, Kevin Kline does so with finesse, and a glint-eyed determination.In his own understated way, he has become one of the greatest actors of our time.Here, he lends his lanky, everyman presence to to the role of Cole Porter in a portrayal that is more true to life than the 1946 Cary Grant portrayal of Porter in ""Night and Day"" (which does get some air time during the course of this film).Physically, he is more imposing and charismatic than the real Cole Porter, and his depth of voice makes his singing only a little better than Porter's. But Kline's own skills as a pianist, to which audiences were first exposed in ""Sophie's Choice"" are very impressive, and lend themselves beautifully to his performance.On a quiet autumn Thursday (according to the New York Times, October 15, 1964 was a Thursday), the lone 73-year-old composer sits  at his piano in his Santa Monica, California home, trickling out a tune of somber reminiscence when a mysterious fellow in a conservatively colored suit named Gabe(song-and-dance man, Jonathan Pryce, very much in his element) shows himself in, and in a manner highly reminiscent of Bob Fosse's ""All That Jazz"", begins reviewing Porter's life with him as the scene changes to an initially empty theatre where the principals of Porter's life appear onstage.The most prominent of these is Linda Lee, the socialite Porter married in 1919, played by an exquisite and refined Ashley Judd. Her stance against her abusive ex-husband (James Wilby)as she is en route to the altar with Cole is one that everyone who has endured a similar ordeal should display.As Robbie Williams sings a galvanizing version of the title song, the two begin a tempestuous and unconventional relationship, and Porter's sexuality (about which I first became aware during the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of his birth) is dealt with honestly, but not in a sexually explicit manner.In the meantime, there is the music. Linda is introduced to Cole at a party  where the clownish Cole is performing with his buddy, Gerald Murphy (Kevin McNally). Soon, the couple become good friends with Murphy and his wife, Sarah (Sandra Nelson).Irving Berlin (Keith Allen) increases Porter's opportunities as a composer, as the couple throw a costume party where Elvis Costello sings Porter's lighthearted summary of the 1920s, ""Let's Misbehave"".Amid subsequent renderings of Porter standards by Alanis Morrisette, Caroline O'Connor, Sheryl Crow, Diana Krall, Vivian Green, Mick Hucknall, Lemar Obika, Lara Fabian, John Barrowman, Mario Frangoulis, Natalie Cole, and Kline, Pryce, and Porter themselves, the audience is treated to often intense, if not enjoyable performances, although I longed for the fiery dance  numbers of the 1946 version of Porter's story at times.Whereas the 1946 film featured the real Montey Woolley, Alan Corduner reveals a different facet of the man in this film.From Venice to Paris, from Broadway to Hollywood and points in between, Porter pursues his career, assorted male lovers , and his platonic relationship with his wife, who was no longer interested in sex after the brutal demands made of her in her first marriage, suffers.But on opening nights of his various shows, Linda never fails to present him with a good-luck Cartier cigarette holder  bearing the show's logo. The Porters ward off blackmail by an ambitious associate (Daniel Craig), and along with the Murphys, cope with tragedy.Generally, this is a layered story with the style and cinematography of a CBS television movie.Whether his controversial lifestyle made him an acceptable candidate for a better afterlife is something only a Higher Power can determine. The number ""Blow Gabriel, Blow"" has a softness, warmth, and poignancy about it, however.But unlike the comically and crassly morbid ending of ""All That Jazz"", at least we can view an attractive and united couple singing as they fade out of sight...Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill, in the chill, still of the night.",4,"Compelling, Beautifully Acted and Frank Drama",1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,4368,"['playing', 'agressive', 'swashbuckling', 'song-filled', 'Pirate', 'King', 'fatally', 'glamourously', 'insane', 'Jewish', 'chemist', 'living', 'Brooklyn', 'death-camp', 'surviving', 'Polish', 'lover', 'writer', 'friend', 'someone', 'reuniting', 'college', 'friends', 'deal', 'suicide', 'journalist', 'exposing', 'injustice', 'repressive', 'land', 'hamming', 'up', 'participant', 'diamond', 'heist', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'so', 'finesse', 'glint-eyed', 'determination.In', 'own', 'understated', 'way', 'become', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'time.Here', 'lanky', 'everyman', 'presence', 'role', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'portrayal', 'more', 'true', 'life', '1946', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'portrayal', 'Porter', 'Night', 'Day', 'get', 'air', 'time', 'course', 'film', '.Physically', 'more', 'imposing', 'charismatic', 'real', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'depth', 'voice', 'singing', 'only', 'little', 'better', 'Porter', 'Kline', 'own', 'skills', 'pianist', 'audiences', 'were', 'first', 'exposed', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'lend', 'beautifully', 'performance.On', 'quiet', 'autumn', 'Thursday', 'according', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'October', '15', '1964', 'was', 'Thursday', 'lone', '73-year-old', 'composer', 'sits', 'piano', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'California', 'home', 'trickling', 'out', 'tune', 'somber', 'reminiscence', 'when', 'mysterious', 'fellow', 'conservatively', 'colored', 'suit', 'named', 'Gabe', 'song-and-dance', 'man', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'very', 'much', 'element', 'manner', 'highly', 'reminiscent', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'Jazz', 'reviewing', 'Porter', 'life', 'scene', 'changes', 'initially', 'empty', 'theatre', 'where', 'principals', 'Porter', 'life', 'appear', 'most', 'prominent', 'Linda', 'Lee', 'socialite', 'Porter', 'married', '1919', 'played', 'exquisite', 'refined', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'stance', 'abusive', 'ex-husband', 'James', 'Wilby', 'en', 'route', 'altar', 'Cole', 'one', 'everyone', 'who', 'endured', 'similar', 'ordeal', 'should', 'display.As', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'galvanizing', 'version', 'title', 'song', 'two', 'begin', 'tempestuous', 'unconventional', 'relationship', 'Porter', 'sexuality', 'first', 'became', 'aware', 'commemoration', '100th', 'anniversary', 'birth', 'dealt', 'honestly', 'not', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'manner.In', 'meantime', 'music', 'Linda', 'introduced', 'Cole', 'party', 'where', 'clownish', 'Cole', 'performing', 'buddy', 'Gerald', 'Murphy', 'Kevin', 'McNally', 'Soon', 'couple', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'Murphy', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Sandra', 'Nelson', '.Irving', 'Berlin', 'Keith', 'Allen', 'Porter', 'opportunities', 'composer', 'couple', 'throw', 'costume', 'party', 'where', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Porter', 'lighthearted', 'summary', '1920s', 'Let', 'Misbehave', '.Amid', 'subsequent', 'renderings', 'Porter', 'standards', 'Alanis', 'Morrisette', 'Caroline', ""O'Connor"", 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'Vivian', 'Green', 'Mick', 'Hucknall', 'Lemar', 'Obika', 'Lara', 'Fabian', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'Mario', 'Frangoulis', 'Natalie', 'Cole', 'Kline', 'Pryce', 'Porter', 'audience', 'treated', 'often', 'intense', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'longed', 'fiery', 'dance', 'numbers', '1946', 'version', 'Porter', 'story', '1946', 'film', 'featured', 'real', 'Montey', 'Woolley', 'Alan', 'Corduner', 'different', 'facet', 'man', 'film.From', 'Venice', 'Paris', 'Broadway', 'Hollywood', 'points', 'Porter', 'career', 'assorted', 'male', 'lovers', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'interested', 'sex', 'brutal', 'demands', 'made', 'first', 'marriage', 'suffers.But', 'opening', 'nights', 'various', 'shows', 'Linda', 'never', 'present', 'good-luck', 'Cartier', 'cigarette', 'holder', 'bearing', 'show', 'logo', 'Porters', 'ward', 'off', 'blackmail', 'ambitious', 'associate', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Murphys', 'cope', 'tragedy.Generally', 'layered', 'story', 'style', 'cinematography', 'CBS', 'television', 'movie.Whether', 'controversial', 'lifestyle', 'made', 'acceptable', 'candidate', 'better', 'afterlife', 'something', 'only', 'Higher', 'Power', 'can', 'determine', 'number', 'Blow', 'Gabriel', 'Blow', 'softness', 'warmth', 'poignancy', 'comically', 'crassly', 'morbid', 'ending', 'All', 'Jazz', 'least', 'can', 'view', 'attractive', 'united', 'couple', 'singing', 'fade', 'sight', 'moon', 'growing', 'dim', 'rim', 'hill', 'chill', 'still', 'night']",N/A

Knouse,"[3, 5]","This film has lavish production value, a good lead performance from Kevin Kline(even though, admittedly, he isn't the greatest singer in the world), but by the final scene I was left feeling cold.  The characters feel emotionally distant; the best of the lot are fantasy beings conjured from Cole Porter's furtile imagination.  There are many scenes where the actors suddenly break out in song.  There are some great cameo appearances by actual singers such as Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morisette, and the incomparable Lara Fabian.  It is at these times that the film is at its most fresh, new blood coursing through the movie and giving it lift.  When professional singers are used the story soars, but when actors are called on to carry a song the scene falls flat with all the choreography looking completely staged.  But when a pro nails a song all that is noticed is the voice over the music, all the dancing besides is merely decoration for an already beautiful moment.  Cole Porter was not a very good singer, so although this movie has historical accuracy going for it, films are supposed to entertain as well as enlighten.  I got plenty of personal inside information about the main character and his loving wife but there were only a few sparkling moments during the film (mostly singers belting out songs) that I enjoyed.  The rest of the film had me shrugging my shoulders and declaring that this film is an average creation.  Not all musicals can be as good as ""Chicago"" but they should at least aspire to be.  This film has only a few exceptional moments via professional singers, a scattered collection of memorable scenes from the actors, an occasional inspired moment from the director, but the end result is that everything else is just plain ordinary.",3,"Passable, but not extraordinary.",1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,1780,"['film', 'lavish', 'production', 'value', 'good', 'lead', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'even', 'admittedly', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'singer', 'world', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'cold', 'characters', 'feel', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'best', 'lot', 'are', 'fantasy', 'beings', 'conjured', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'furtile', 'imagination', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'actors', 'suddenly', 'break', 'out', 'song', 'are', 'great', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'actual', 'singers', 'such', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Alanis', 'Morisette', 'incomparable', 'Lara', 'Fabian', 'times', 'film', 'most', 'fresh', 'new', 'blood', 'coursing', 'movie', 'giving', 'lift', 'When', 'professional', 'singers', 'are', 'used', 'story', 'soars', 'when', 'actors', 'are', 'called', 'carry', 'song', 'scene', 'flat', 'choreography', 'looking', 'completely', 'staged', 'when', 'pro', 'nails', 'song', 'noticed', 'voice', 'music', 'dancing', 'besides', 'merely', 'decoration', 'already', 'beautiful', 'moment', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'singer', 'so', 'movie', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'going', 'films', 'are', 'supposed', 'entertain', 'as', 'well', 'enlighten', 'got', 'plenty', 'personal', 'information', 'main', 'character', 'loving', 'wife', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'sparkling', 'moments', 'film', 'mostly', 'belting', 'out', 'songs', 'enjoyed', 'rest', 'film', 'had', 'shrugging', 'shoulders', 'declaring', 'film', 'average', 'creation', 'Not', 'musicals', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Chicago', 'should', 'least', 'aspire', 'be', 'film', 'only', 'few', 'exceptional', 'moments', 'professional', 'singers', 'scattered', 'collection', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'actors', 'occasional', 'inspired', 'moment', 'director', 'end', 'result', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'plain', 'ordinary']",N/A

This is the best role she has played to date, and I think she will be mentioned this Oscar season.Otherwise, I did not enjoy this movie at all. First, the make-up department did a bad job. It must be difficult to make younger actors look as though they were aging. And in some scenes the makeup was just to distracting. I think instead of piling makeup on young actors to make them look old - it is better to just hire a young actor and an old actor who look similar. The makeup was one thing that ruined the movie for me.The story of Cole Porter is interesting. I think it could have been told better. Instead the movie just played out like a soap opera, showing disfunctional behavior between a husband and wife. Judd's character Linda, marries Klines character, Cole Porter and tells him that he can have his boyfriends on the side. But when he spends so much time with his male interests, she gets depressed and sad. I think there could have been a much more interesting and romantic story to tell about this couple.All that being said, if you want to see an amazing performance by an actress, see this movie for Ashley Judd's performance.

862179,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,B00067BBLY,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[6, 8]","I really feel myself in the minority here... This has to be one of the all time worst movies since Robin William's powerful dramatic performance in POPEYE (and he did look like him by the way.)I happen to be a Cole Porter fan... a Jazz musician, and a fanatical lover of Broadway Musicals... KISS ME KATE in particular.  Now, if you want to get an idea where this film went wrong, terribly wrong, go out and actually get a REAL BROADWAY MUSICAL CAST RECORDING and listen to it.  (I'd like to say go to Broadway, but with some of the garbage that's been knocking the revivals and even better musicals from their theatres, I worry about making such suggestions.  Trust me, if you know real Broadway you would never really want to utter the words Weber or Sondheim in the same breath and Porter or Jules Stein)  Even buy the GREAT PERFORMANCES DVD broadcast of KISS ME KATE... Also, go out and get some REAL Jazz Singers singing REAL Cole Porter tunes at their best... Even popular singers of the past like Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. then watch this movie and note a couple of things... 1.  Its horribly bland.  2.  The cast and singers just aren't up to the task.  YES, its cute to hear Generation X and even a few aging baby boomer and yuppie era pop singers singing... but come on - - COLE PORTER is the GOD of the great American song book and his songs were debuted by the God's and DIVAS of the Broadway stage... and these people may have been able to turn magic on a ballad, but were anything but wishy washy cute faced pop crooners... The should deliver a note or lyric and turn your skin to ice or goose bumps.  In fairness, this movie captures the essence of true Broadway musicals almost as bad as most HOLLYWOOD films do (again, if you don't believe, go out and get the actual BROADWAY cast recordings of your favorite HOLLYWOOD adaptations... or see a real musical and you'll realize that in general, Hollywood's take on the Broadway musicals usually fall short, even when the movies do become legendary.)  - - Trust me, if the director was really serious about something more than turning a buck, he might have used some pop singers for a few tunes to turn heads, but gone out at got the REAL PROS to show the pop singers how its really done right (as well as have gotten some real musical orchestrators and arrangers.)  Though much of the music was cute and lush, I am reminded that real musical orchestras don't have orchestras that sound like 101 Strings or the Harry Connick Jr. Big Band... they often swing very hard and are excitingly orchestrated.That said, what about this film as a biography ? - - Well, Cole Porter was obvoiusly a colorful charactor not only in light of the fact that he was a genius, but also because of his unique (and in its time both scandelous and posh) lifestyle and being an ICON of his era... yet I found this film in General to have all the excitement of a made-for-TV HBO movie...  At times its cute (ooooooo... Cole Porter looking back at his life from an empty theatre as if his life was one of his own musicals, what an ORIGINAL idea...!) but really, I just didn't get anything out of this movie other than the fact that the guy wrote a lot of songs, liked men, was in a horse accident, and this and that.  However, by no means is this inspired cinema and I would say that the substance and legitamacy of the performances are about the same as the portrayal of the charactors in this film... CUTE at best, but generally bland and when not bland gushily sentimental in a way I wouldn't associate with the sharp tongued Cole Porter who wrote some of the most clever lyrics of all time.To put it bluntly...  the film is often corny, bland, superficial and at many times the ""speculation"" is lest interesting than the facts - - his childhood and formative years (and the question of how he came to develop his unique talents and style) are totally missed) and at times the directing is silly and almost a high budget bad take on a classic Hollywood musical that goes all wrong (at times you're almost wondering if Irwin Winkler is secretly praying that the film itself will one day become a great musical in itself...  My response :  I should hope not !All in all, this happens to be one of the worst biographicals on a BROADWAY GREAT since All That Jazz (remember Foss's 20 minute song and dance heart attack in the operating room) ???  - - In conclusion, if the topic interests you, cruise Amazon for recordings of his musicals, read a book about the man, or hope that eventually one day the Gershwins, Porters, Irving Berlins and even their modern day counterparts are able to chase all the lions, cats and dancing French people off the somewhat currently polluted stages of the great white

That's a given. But why do we need so many movies about the rich and famous' sufferings and lives? This question becomes particularly pressing when negatives about these same people get swooped under the carpet. Cole Porter was an amazing songman. One of the best of the 20th century, hands down. Anyone who can crank out ""Night And Day"", ""Blow, Gabriel, Blow"", ""Anything Goes"", ""You're The Tops"" etc., etc., had unbelievable talent. On the flip side, he was self-obsessed, spendthrifty, snobbish, and probably not someone the average person would want to have dinner with (not that the real Porter would have wanted to have dinner with an ""average"" person). ""Delovely"" shows Porter's self-obsession and, indirectly, his tremendous wealth. It also shows his taste for both genders in bed. Lastly, it showcases some of Porter's best music. And the music is by far the best part of this movie.What the movie does not do is teach us much about Porter himself. The major events in this picture are his discovery, his successful shows, his marriage, his philandering, his injury, his moving to and from exciting places such as Paris, New York, Venice, Hollywood, and his wife's death. But does anything really happen? Towards the end of the film, one of his friends suggests that Porter write songs based on his ""fascinating life"". One is left to wonder, based on this movie, what the fascinating parts of his life were: swanky parties? wealth? sleeping around? being crushed by a horse? Something seems missing.The ""biography in a movie musical"" approach taken here doesn't seem to work either. Sometimes it's a musical, sometimes not. Why portray Porter's life in this way? Who was Jonathan Bryce's character exactly? It's all sort of cryptic and undefined. It did provide great seugeways to songs and musical numbers, though. But in the end it doesn't teach us anything about Porter, and he apparently doesn't learn much about himself in the process, either.A few nagging and dangling questions also remain: were Porter and Linda completely unable to have a child after Linda's ""incident""? Were they unable to try again? Didn't they want to? All we get are hints and the issue gets wooshed away. Also, is ""Night And Day"" really that difficult of a song to sing? Fred Astaire was not known as a barnstorming vocalist, and he pulled it off beautifully. Porter wrote far more difficult music than that one. Also, how did Porter discover his bisexuality? How did it effect him? In his day this was extreme taboo. It must have caused him at least some problems. Perhaps his wealth protected him, but ""Delovely"" doesn't address this issue in any detail. It shows Porter in the act as if the situation with Linda was the only potential consequence (true, there's a scene with some illicit photos, but the scene doesn't get developed much). So the most salient question remaining at the end is ""Who was Cole Porter?""The movie plays like a musical first and a biography second. This probably accounts for the incomplete feeling it exudes and the ""musical within a movie"" approach taken. Nonetheless, ""Delovely"" still manages to entertain and tug at the heart strings. And many of the musical numbers are fantastic. But for those looking to learn about Cole Porter, this is not the place to do so. To hear his music, sure, but Porter wrote loads of amazing material that doesn't even get a mention in ""Delovely"". So don't stop the Cole Porter journey here. This film only gives an insular peek into the music and the man.",4,"Musical first, biography second...",1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,3639,"['Ok', 'rich', 'people', 'have', 'problems', 'too', 'grow', 'old', 'die', 'suffer', 'many', 'same', 'ways', 'people', 'gobs', 'wealth', 'do', 'given', 'why', 'do', 'need', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'rich', 'famous', 'sufferings', 'lives', 'question', 'particularly', 'pressing', 'when', 'negatives', 'same', 'people', 'get', 'swooped', 'carpet', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'was', 'amazing', 'songman', 'One', 'best', '20th', 'century', 'down', 'Anyone', 'who', 'can', 'crank', 'out', 'Night', 'Day', 'Blow', 'Gabriel', 'Blow', 'Anything', 'Goes', ""'re"", 'Tops', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'had', 'unbelievable', 'talent', 'flip', 'side', 'was', 'self-obsessed', 'spendthrifty', 'snobbish', 'probably', 'not', 'someone', 'average', 'person', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'dinner', 'not', 'real', 'Porter', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'have', 'dinner', 'average', 'person', 'Delovely', 'Porter', 'self-obsession', 'indirectly', 'tremendous', 'wealth', 'also', 'taste', 'genders', 'bed', 'Lastly', 'Porter', 'best', 'music', 'music', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'do', 'teach', 'much', 'Porter', 'major', 'events', 'picture', 'are', 'discovery', 'successful', 'shows', 'marriage', 'philandering', 'injury', 'moving', 'exciting', 'places', 'such', 'Paris', 'New', 'York', 'Venice', 'Hollywood', 'wife', 'death', 'anything', 'really', 'happen', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'friends', 'Porter', 'write', 'songs', 'based', 'fascinating', 'life', 'One', 'left', 'wonder', 'based', 'movie', 'what', 'fascinating', 'parts', 'life', 'were', 'swanky', 'parties', 'wealth', 'sleeping', 'around', 'being', 'crushed', 'horse', 'Something', 'missing.The', 'biography', 'movie', 'musical', 'approach', 'taken', 'here', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'either', 'musical', 'sometimes', 'not', 'Why', 'portray', 'Porter', 'life', 'way', 'Who', 'was', 'Jonathan', 'Bryce', 'character', 'exactly', 'sort', 'cryptic', 'undefined', 'did', 'provide', 'great', 'seugeways', 'songs', 'musical', 'numbers', 'though', 'end', ""n't"", 'teach', 'anything', 'Porter', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'process', 'either.A', 'few', 'nagging', 'dangling', 'questions', 'also', 'remain', 'were', 'Porter', 'Linda', 'completely', 'unable', 'have', 'child', 'Linda', 'incident', 'Were', 'unable', 'try', 'again', 'Did', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'are', 'hints', 'issue', 'wooshed', 'away', 'Also', 'Night', 'Day', 'really', 'difficult', 'song', 'sing', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'was', 'not', 'known', 'barnstorming', 'vocalist', 'pulled', 'off', 'beautifully', 'Porter', 'wrote', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'music', 'one', 'Also', 'how', 'did', 'Porter', 'discover', 'bisexuality', 'How', 'did', 'effect', 'day', 'was', 'extreme', 'taboo', 'must', 'have', 'caused', 'least', 'problems', 'Perhaps', 'wealth', 'protected', 'Delovely', ""n't"", 'address', 'issue', 'detail', 'Porter', 'act', 'situation', 'Linda', 'was', 'only', 'potential', 'consequence', 'true', 'scene', 'illicit', 'photos', 'scene', ""n't"", 'get', 'developed', 'much', 'most', 'salient', 'question', 'remaining', 'end', 'Who', 'was', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'movie', 'musical', 'first', 'biography', 'second', 'probably', 'incomplete', 'feeling', 'musical', 'movie', 'approach', 'taken', 'Nonetheless', 'Delovely', 'still', 'entertain', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings', 'many', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'fantastic', 'looking', 'learn', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'not', 'place', 'do', 'so', 'hear', 'music', 'sure', 'Porter', 'wrote', 'loads', 'amazing', 'material', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'mention', 'Delovely', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'journey', 'here', 'film', 'only', 'insular', 'peek', 'music', 'man']",N/A

862187,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00067BBLY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[10, 12]","'Delovely' is an interesting portrait of Cole Porter and his wife, Linda, played out against a backdrop of Cole's songs from various musicals.  The film is framed in a tryptych manner -- the first act is the Paris/Venice time; the second act takes place in New York; the third act in Hollywood.  In between are minor scenes fleshing out the life of the Porters.Cole Porter was born in the late 1800s, and came to prominence in the same post-war, roaring 20s ages that also saw people such as Irving Berlin and Noel Coward.  He met the desirable and socially-connected divorcee Linda Taylor in Paris; their marriage seemed from the outside rather idyllic, but there was a secret.  This was a marriage of love, to be sure, but not lust.  Cole Porter was gay, not really even bisexual, but gay.  While this came as no surprise to Linda, over time Cole's attachments to his other loves threatened the integrity of their relationship in Linda's eyes.Cole Porter tried to be faithful to three things -- to his wife, Linda; to his music; and to his own identity.  These did not always fit well together.  Even though faithfulness to Linda meant emotional and relationship attachment rather than sexual fidelity, even here, Cole's attachments to some of his lovers would become strong enough to warrant Linda wanting a change; unfortunately for her, Cole was able to find a gay life no matter where they moved.  Linda's ultimate reconciliation to this came from her recognition that Cole's life, like his music, couldn't be restrained.  Cole's ultimate regret was that he couldn't find the perfect someone, that his love was always meaningful but not always satisfying.Kevin Kline's protrayal of the conflicted Cole Porter is a very good one; Ashley Judd's Linda is very sensitive and stunningly portrayed.  Jonathan Pryce is the shadowy director, who pieces together the life of the Porters in a montage in front of an aged Cole, not quite in flashback, but in time-sequence inspiration.  We as the audience watching with Cole are introduced to major figures in his life, including some of his lovers (but only peripherally), and many of his friends, but most figures remain undeveloped save for Cole and Linda.The sets, the scene sequence changes from 'actual' to 'stage', and the scene-shift tone of character are all very effective.  Cole Porter's running commentary on his own life helps provide an historical framework as well as an emotional one; the narrative is carried by both the relationship interactions and the songs -- Cole Porter put so much of his own life into the songs.  He claims at various points that they were all written for Linda; Linda, ever the realist in the shell of an idealist, knows better, and says so.While much of the story, the sets, the costume and even the credits are done in a style of the 1920s and 1930s (Art Deco is a prominent, recurring theme), the music did not take on this style.  More in the tone of 'Red, Hot, and Blue', the Cole Porter-themed tribute album of the late 80s, the songs were often modern renderings of old standards, but modern stars such as Elvis Costello, Alanyis Morrisette, and Sheryl Crow.  There are a good number of pieces performed by Kevin Klein and Ashley Judd themselves, Klein performing them as the less-than-stellar-singer Porter himself might have done them.  While the music being performed in more modern arrangement jars a little bit with the more time-bound theme of the film, it is still effective in the sense that Porter's music is timeless in many ways.The movie drags a bit at times, but it covers the long stretch of Cole Porter's career, and his marriage with Linda from beginning to end.  Romance with a decided twist, this is a somewhat sad film, in that despite the obvious love around the characters in the film, no one is finally satisfied with such love.

862188,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00067BBLY,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[74, 76]","Cole Porter, legendary composer and lyricist, met and married American divorcee Linda in Paris.  The marriage was unexpected: where Porter was clearly homosexual, Linda was uninterested in physical intimacy.  Even so, those who knew them describe them as deeply in love with each other on a purely emotional level.  Throughout their long marriage, Porter repeatedly engaged in shallow liaisons with various men while Linda looked the other way--at least as long as Porter was reasonably discreet.Porter's sense of discretion was not always sufficent for Linda, who left him several times and threatened divorce on at least one occasion.  It was, however, enough ""to get by"" with the vast public, which saw only the glamour of their lives and the great brilliance of Porter's talents.  The result was a 1946 film biography that put many of Porter's greatest songs before the camera while casting handsome Cary Grant as the waspish Porter and lovely Alexis Smith as the somewhat icy Linda--a movie that went over well with audiences but which actually had very little basis in reality.The 2004 DE-LOVELY takes a considerably different tack.  It would be hard to say that the film ""tells all""--but it tells enough and it offers a host of high-art concepts and truly fine performances in the process.  It debuted with tremendous fanfare and then, amazingly, seemed to vanish from the screen within a single night.  While most critics liked the film, the public did not, and they were pretty emphatic about it.Some audiences complained about the ""artiness"" of the film's concept, which consists of the aging Porter reviewing the major events of his life through the filter of a stage show--an idea that seems to owe a great deal to Bob Fosse's ALL THAT JAZZ without managing to carry it off with the same conviction.  Some Porter fans complained that the contemporary pop singers used in the film couldn't carry Porter's music; others complained that the music was never presented in a straight-forward sort of way.  Still others were taken aback by the discovery that Porter was gay--and truly one has to wonder where such viewers have been for the past fifty years, that they somehow managed to miss this very widely circulated bit of information.In truth, the concept works reasonably if not spectacularly well, the singers are acceptable if not always knock-out in their performances, and Porter's sexual habits are made plain without throwing the characters in and out of bed on the screen.  The real problem with DE-LOVELY, at least to my mind, is two-fold: it is just ever-so-slightly slow and it is profoundly, and I do mean profoundly, depressing.  Each tends to heighten the effect of the other.On the other hand, the performances are exceptionally good.  Kevin Kline is hardly a look-alike for the small, dark Cole Porter, but you believe him in the role.  As for Ashley Judd--the role of Linda Porter would seem impossible to play in a believable sort of way, much less in a sympathetic manner, but she carries it flawlessly from start to finish.  Together they are brilliant, and that isn't a word I use very often in refence to contemporary film making.The DVD contains a host of bonuses, including two audio tracks and several behind-the-scenes documentaries, and for once the word ""bonus"" really is generally applicable.  While it will probably prove too dark for most, many will be fascinated by the way DE-LOVELY turns the glitter of Porter's public life into a costume for his often bitter private life--something that was very much the case in reality.

It did, however, peak my interest for more information on Cole Porter.My friend and I were discussing the era. We both remember the magnificent Porter songs from our own youth in the 40's and 50's and thought the dress code shown in the movie was from the 1930's or 40's. It turns out that Cole Porter was born in 1891 so his early song writing days were probably in the 1920's. His first song was written when he was 10 years old! He and Linda married in 1919.Kevin Kline did an excellent portrayal of Cole Porter. I wonder, if it was really him singing and playing the piano? If so, Congratulations, Kevin.The plot moved slowly. I got bored early in the movie.The jewelry the ladies wore to the premier events made me drool. I sell vintage jewelry at Atlanta vintage jewelry dot com and would love to have some of those necklaces and brooches shown in the movie.

862191,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00067BBLY,Grady Harp,"[8, 10]","DE-LOVELY is a refreshingly obtuse biopic of the music and life of Cole Porter.  Rather than opting for the usual Hollywood ""Glenn Miler Story"" type of sappy melodrama, writer Jay Cocks and Director Irwin Winkler have pieced together aspects of Cole's controversial life (remember, Cole Porter  thrived in a time when homosexuality and other variations of sexual orientation were a covert in extremis - his years 1891 - 1964) and in doing so have created a unique collage of one of America's most important popular music writers.The various aspects of Cole Porter's life are presented as vignettes observed by the aged Porter (Kevin Kline) and 'directed' by Gabriel (Jonathan Pryce) seated in a dilapidated Broadway theater observing various on stage song recreations and flashbacks to the incidents in Porter's life that informed his prodigious output of music.  From living the high life in Venice and  Paris where he meets and weds Linda Thomas (Ashley Judd) in 1919, all the while entertaining the upper class to his witty ditties, CP and Linda move to New York and then Hollywood where he rapidly becomes the equivalent of Irving Berlin as one of America's most popular songsters.Cole Porter's homosexuality is well addressed in this film and made all the more poignant by including his utter devotion to his understanding and supportive wife (far more than just a cover).  While trysts are alluded to and briefly shown, it is clear that the writer and director chose not to make CP's sexual orientation the sum and substance of his elegant, intelligent songs.  In line with CP's own credo, that ""Words and music must be so inseparably wedded to each other that they are like one"", we are treated to a luxurious number of songs presented in both stage form and intimate piano and voice form.  Many of the songs are rendered by current popular musicians and to this reviewer this adds yet another dimension to the film: the film is not an archive but a living homage to a man whose songs are still part of everyone's repertoire.The tragedies of CP's life are included - his broken legs in a horse riding accident in 1937 and the subsequent altered lifestyle that imposed, Linda's miscarriage of their only conceived child, his amputation of one the much operated legs in 1958, etc - as well as the his success with celebrated shows like Kiss Me Kate, Can Can, Anthing Goes, Silk Stockings, The gay Divorcee, etc.  Much of this biopic could have become stale were it not for the magnificent performances by Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd.  They are radiant, find the right curious chemistry that kept them together despite Porter's lifestyle, and they sing and play well enough to be credible.This is a movie of imagination and one to which most who see it will return frequently - for the music, for the filming techniques, and for the luminous performances by all involved.

It's funny, it's charming, and, of course, it's sad.  Also, the acting is very good across the board -- especially Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd, although their characters' many followers are also portrayed marvelously.  This is definitely a film worth seeing, hearing, and, since you'll probably be watching it in your living room, occasionally dancing along with.  It also does a very nice, subtle job of capturing the hurt that is innevitable when (in this case) a wife suddenly recognizes that she has become an adjunct to her husband's social popularity, where she once was his equal or better.That's the good news.  The bad news is that the structure of the film is a little hard to take at times and, to me, opens the film by needlessly casting a negative pall over the entire story.  I don't want to give too much away here, but after popping in the DVD happy to learn more about the life of one of my musical favorites, I was immediately greeted with a dour message of what a schmuck he apparently was, at least to one person, during the most productive years of his life.  This undercut the enjoyment of the story tremendously for me, but hopefully it won't hit you as hard.My other disappointment with the film is more personal.  Part of why I have long revered Porter is that he was from Indiana, as am I.  Thus, since this IS a biopic, I also went into it hoping to learn a little of what it was about his Hoosier childhood that led to his remarkable talents.  (I assure you, it wasn't the cornfields or the strong KKK presence of the time.)  Unfortunately, the only reference to his childhood is in the Deleted Scenes section of the DVD, and is unrelated.  Again, this disappointment has more to do with my own background, but I think any Cole Porter fan would enjoy seeing A LITTLE background on where this man's sense of humor, incredible use of language, and musical talents came from.  Unlike his competitors, after all, he wrote both the music AND lyrics of his songs.Overall, though, if you like Cole Porter's music -- or even the music of his contemporaries, like Gershwin, Berlin, or Lerner & Lowe -- you will enjoy this film.  It does a nice job of capturing not only the elegance and style of the period, but the hard work and deal-making necessary for even great talents to make it in the entertainment business then...and now.",3,"S'Wonderful Music, S'Mediocre Movie",1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,2472,"['Irwin', 'Winkler', 'De-Lovely', 'style', 'grace', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'renditions', 'many', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'most', 'famous', 'songs', 'funny', 'charming', 'course', 'sad', 'Also', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'board', 'especially', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'characters', 'many', 'followers', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'marvelously', 'definitely', 'film', 'seeing', 'hearing', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'watching', 'living', 'room', 'occasionally', 'dancing', 'along', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'subtle', 'job', 'capturing', 'hurt', 'innevitable', 'when', 'case', 'wife', 'suddenly', 'become', 'adjunct', 'husband', 'social', 'popularity', 'where', 'once', 'was', 'equal', 'better.That', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'structure', 'film', 'little', 'hard', 'take', 'times', 'film', 'needlessly', 'casting', 'negative', 'pall', 'entire', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'here', 'popping', 'DVD', 'happy', 'learn', 'more', 'life', 'one', 'musical', 'favorites', 'was', 'immediately', 'greeted', 'dour', 'message', 'what', 'schmuck', 'apparently', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'most', 'productive', 'years', 'life', 'undercut', 'enjoyment', 'story', 'tremendously', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hit', 'hard.My', 'other', 'disappointment', 'film', 'more', 'personal', 'Part', 'why', 'have', 'long', 'revered', 'Porter', 'was', 'Indiana', 'am', 'Thus', 'biopic', 'also', 'went', 'hoping', 'learn', 'little', 'what', 'was', 'Hoosier', 'childhood', 'led', 'remarkable', 'talents', 'assure', 'was', ""n't"", 'cornfields', 'strong', 'KKK', 'presence', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'reference', 'childhood', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'section', 'DVD', 'unrelated', 'Again', 'disappointment', 'more', 'do', 'own', 'background', 'think', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'fan', 'would', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'LITTLE', 'background', 'where', 'man', 'sense', 'humor', 'incredible', 'use', 'language', 'musical', 'talents', 'came', 'competitors', 'wrote', 'music', 'AND', 'lyrics', 'songs.Overall', 'though', 'like', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'music', 'even', 'music', 'contemporaries', 'Gershwin', 'Berlin', 'Lerner', 'Lowe', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'nice', 'job', 'capturing', 'not', 'only', 'elegance', 'style', 'period', 'hard', 'work', 'deal-making', 'necessary', 'even', 'great', 'talents', 'make', 'entertainment', 'business', 'then', 'now']",N/A

I hate to say it but Kevin Kline was simply too old to play the young Cole Porter. Except for an exhausting boyish charm, no attempt was made to make him look like a younger man. He fared much better as the old Cole Porter although then he looked strangely like Carl Reiner. Ashley Judd, as his long compliant wife is lovely but her constant staunch characterization finally comes full circle with the Columbia Motion Pictures lady with the torch.

In depicting Cole Porter's songs, rockers Alanis Morissette, Elvis Costello, and Sheryl Crow should have been given their pink slips as soon as they opened their mouths. They are not versatile singers and their renditions are of butchery. I couldn't imagine that Elvis Costello could look any more ridiculous than he already does. Was is that he's doing, the frug dance from the '60s? Now that I got that off my chest, I really enjoyed this film. It's a neat glitzy melodrama.

Let me say at the outset that I really wanted to like this movie. The logic goes something like this:1. I really think that Cole Porter is great.2. This film is about the great Cole Porter.3. Therefore, the film must be as great as he is.WRONG! This movie is a ghastly wheezer and inexcusably bad. The flashback plot is moldy.The idea of an endless flashback where the elderly composer reviews his life in a never-ending stream of wise-after-the-fact comments is unbearable irritating. Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, the film never appeared to get a final edit, and it is far too long to be supported by whatever flabby drama is wheeled onto the stage. As a result, it drags unbearably.This film achieved the impossible. It made Cole Porter's life seem dull. They must have tried very hard to get this result.The actor who plays Porter is at least ten inches too tall, he has a huge nose, and he looks to be at least 50 years old from the very beginning of this disaster. Why did they select an Arthur Treacher clone to play Cole Porter? The acting is also quite dreadful. There are endless say-cheese smiles, and cigarette smoke is always melodramatically puffed out in a long jet exactly perpendicular to the camrea lens like the villains used to do in a film noir. All too often the camera seems to be bolted down, and the cinematography has a snapshot quality that is totally undistinguished. There is also a lot of naming, almost as much as a news program or a weather report. People's names are constantly tacked onto the ends of sentences, as if we might have a hard time figuring out who the cast of hundreds actually was. And now back to you, Sam, at the studio, Sam! Sam, are you there, Sam?This film was so trivial that I remained totally unmoved. It was such a bland pablum of library paste and cornstarch that I didn't even feel disgusted at the utter waste of film stock.NEWS TO HOLLYWOOD: If you want to make a bad film that is immune from criticism, give it a religious theme.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[8, 11]","Irwin Winkler, the director of this film about Cole Porter, has chosen the device of the movie within the movie or play within the movie to present his story. Cole Porter (Kevin Klein) is an old man (wondrously made up incidentally) sitting in an empty auditorium watching his life unfold before him. There are many good reasons to see this movie, not the least of which is the score (words and music by Cole Porter). Both Klein and Ashley Judd do respectable jobs with their singing, which runs of course in the Judd family along with good looks. Some of the singing done by various artists is uneven; but seeing the movie made me want to buy a Cole Porter CD sung by someone with the talent of Ella Fitzgerald, for instance. Although the critics seem to be agog over Klein's acting-- and he is fine here-- certainly his performance is balanced by that of Ms. Judd, who does a beautifully nuanced portrait of Linda, Porter's (for the most part) understanding wife.Although Mr. Porter wrote wonderful music which is still bringing joy to a great many people, his marriage, particularly in his later life, if the movie is accurate, was not always happy. There is never any question, however, that the love between the Porters was true and enduring, in spite of Porter's other gay ""night"" life. The film is quite moving; the stranger sitting next to me wept several times in the movie and I heard sniffles behind me.The movie is beautifully filmed.

In an early scene where Cole woos Linda, Kevin Kline appeared to literally channel the late, great Herbert Marshall.  Making it all the more eerie, the real life Marshall suffered from the same physical ailment that comes to haunt Porter towards the end of the story.  Irwin Winkler shows signs of the Lubitsch touch, as the witty dialogue and European sophistication frequently reminded me of Trouble in Paradise (1932).  Back in Hollywood, the number with Louis B. Mayer struck me as particularly brilliant.  Of course the enchanting music of Cole Porter permeates everything in the film; you'll be surprised how many songs you already know.  Great cameo singing performances pop up throughout the story.  Watch for Robbie Williams, Elvis Costello, Alanis Morissette, Carolyn O'Conner, Sheryl Crow, Natalie Cole, and others.  Finally, the presentation of Porter's alternate lifestyle is handled with a subtlety and sophistication again indebted to Winkler's modern Lubitsch touch.You'll forgive De-Lovely if it ultimately drags on a bit too long.  The problem for this hetero male reviewer was in feeling much sympathy for the lead character.  The love Cole feels for his wife towards the end of the story is ultimately a piteous and regretful emotion:  it is akin to the sadness one feels after the loss of a pet (I should have let it in more, taken it for more regular shots, etc).  And his sadness looking back on his life seems ultimately shallow and selfish, derived from too strong an adoration of youthful masculine exuberance, a sentiment I fear all too common amongst his brethren.  If he would have but loved his wife, I thought, he would have probably still had his health and a happy old age amongst his grandchildren.  But perhaps such a man would never have been capable of the same artistic heights.

862200,A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7,B00067BBLY,James Carragher,"[3, 4]","De-Lovely actually falls a bit short of 4 stars for me, but I erred on the high side because most published reviews I read in Washington and New York papers ripped it badly.  The film does not deserve being trashed.  Kevin Kline is fine as always as Cole Porter.  The dramatic concept, Porter attending his life as a play -- accompanied by Gabe (gosh, wonder who that is!) -- at the moment of his death, is promising, if not exactly original.  Having current pop stars sing Porter standards works better in some cases (Elvis Costello in a terrific Let's Misbehave) than in others (Sheryl Crow), but is also a nice idea that is generally successful.  The scenes in Venice, particularly a visit by Irving Berlin to a not-yet-famous Porter, Paris and New York have energy and nuance, but the long Hollywood sequence, once past the entertaining opening of Be a Clown, takes a lot of air out of the movie.  The biggest problem, however, is that De-Lovely, like Tim Burton's Big Fish, promises more than it delivers in originality and audacity.  It's a musical, for heaven's sake, jazz it up! The topic of Porter's sexuality is handled with deadening discretion.  Why not inject more arbitrariness in the life scenes presented? I suspect that no one at his life's end reviews it in strict chronological order.  Why not have put the aged, watching Porter directly into some of the earlier scenes in his life?  Why not more cutting and commentary between the empty theater where Porter and Gabe watch and the scenes as they play out?So, yes, De-Lovely could have been better, perhaps much better, than it is, but don't be put off.  It is worth seeing -- and if you go you will likely find a demographic unusual for a movie theater.  The 70+ set, who I guess were young to this music, was out in force at the show my wife and I attended.

I am also one of those gay activists who refused to even CONSIDER seeing ""Shakespeare In Love"" because I've been told that that film is devoid of the even the slightest hint that The Bard also liked men.  So, when I read some of the reviews of De-Lovely that flat-out declared it a revisionist version of Cole Porter's sex life, with little focus on his gay affairs and most of the plot concentrated on his heterosexual marriage, I was prepared to hate this film before I even saw the trailer.  I collect films with gay content.  Because I was told that this film is at least marginally gay, and since I love the work of Cole Porter, I brought the film and mentally prepared myself for a disappointing experience, or maybe even an evening of aggravation.  When the end credits were rolling, I found I wasn't half as disappointed as I thought I would be, and that in itself was a pleasant surprise.  In fact, this portrait of Cole paints him exactly the way I have always understood him to be - that is, a gay man who happened to marry a woman whom he truly loved.  It also maintains that his love for his wife had little or no effect on his relations with men, which is also exactly the way I have always understood that he lived his dual life.  Given the times he lived in, he was extraordinarily upfront about his sex life, and I found no inconsistency with how he managed both of his sex lives (with men and women) and juggled a high-profile career at the same time.The flashbacks are easily the best part of the picture, and they should have left well enough alone.  Instead, we get the ridiculous premise that an unnamed director escorts the dying Cole Porter to view a live stage piece / film biography of himself.  This scenario is so tired that every time the flashbacks lapse, you cringe with embarrassment for the people who created this film, and the leaden pace that permeates those scenes is almost too much to bear.  Not only do they interrupt the narrative, while the flashbacks are halted, Porter offers comments and does his best to ""correct"" the facts, all the while turning melancholic and teary-eyed when images of his dead wife appear.Even worse news - for the most part, the musical numbers are absolutely pathetic.  First of all, if you're going to make a musical (and this film is advertised as a musical), it would be a good idea to let the music be heard.  Instead, we get renditions of Porter's best songs in which all his snappy verses are completely obscured by dialogue.  This is not only supposed to be a musical, it's supposed to celebrate the genius of Cole Porter, arguably the greatest Tin Pan Alley composer of the twentieth century.  So why are his brilliant lyrics hidden behind snatches of bad screenwriting?  Then there are the performances of the songs themselves.  Most of the songs are assigned arrangements that are much too modern for a period piece.  In particular, the songs Love For Sale (Vivian Green), Just One of Those Things (Diana Krall) and Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye (Natalie Cole, in the worst renditions of this song I've ever heard - and I used to like her a lot) are all utterly savaged by up-to-the-minute arrangements that brought Cindy Lauper to mind.  The worst reading by far was by Sheryl Crow, who destroys the delicate melody of Begin The Beguine, and had me yearning for Ella Fitzgerald, Fred Astaire or just about anybody else from the actual period.  If it wasn't for Elvis Costello, who was one of the few performance artists in this picture who seemed to understand that it's set in the 1920's-1940's, and the delightful Caroline O'Conner, whose vocal imitation of Ethel Merman is so spot-on it's scary, the soundtrack would be a total waste.  Costello and O'Conner alone save the day and make the music come to life.  Of course, Kevin Kline doesn't sing very well, but neither did Cole Porter, so that was acceptable.  The scene where Porter coaxes an actor into believing he can sing the difficult Night and Day was brilliant, and may be the best scene in the film.  On the whole, I wasn't as disappointed with De-Lovely as I expected to be, at least not for the reasons that I thought I would.  The biographical information was fairly accurate, Kline's performance was quite believable, and in particular, Ashley Judd's portrayal of Linda Porter was quite well realized.Flawed, yes, but not as hard a slap in my gay face as I was afraid it might turn out to be.",3,"Disappointing, But For Different Reasons Than I Expected",1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,4551,"['am', 'one', 'gay', 'men',

And I don't know anything about his biography, so if this film got any thing wrong, I wouldn't know.What I do know is that this was a touching, imaginative and beautifully crafted tribute to Cole Porter that depicted the great arcs of his life, his loves and his music. Kevin Kline left his usually blithe persona aside to play Porter to a tee. Ashley Judd, as his wife Linda, was picture perfect as the divorcee who fell in love with Porter and who endured heartache after heartache to love him and to bring his music out of his heart and out to the world.""De-Lovely"" is a tribute to Porter, and takes the form of a series of flashbacks through his life, with Jonathan Price playing the role of Virgil to Porter's Dante. Porter's music is sung onscreen by some big stars, including Elvis Costello, Alanis Morrissette and Sheryl Crow. Porter purists might object to the way the songs have been given a facelift. But the fact that his music can thrive under such treatment is a testament to its staying power.The film doesn't flinch at Porter's difficult personality and life. His homosexual flings are depicted as increasingly difficult for Linda to bear, causing an estrangement that strained their relationship to breaking. An accident that almost destroyed his mobility added personal suffering to a man more accustomed to having others suffer on his behalf.

Gradually we come to realize that Porter is talking to the angel of Death, and examining his life in preparation for death.Naturally Porter's life is filled with his music, the score of this film is all the songs that we have heard all our lives.  Here they serve to set the scenes of his life and move the story along.  Various present day stars perform the numbers, they are inserted into the story in such a way that at first the viewer may not be aware who they are.Even if you saw this in the theatre I would recommend buying this dvd, this is a film worth seeing over and over again.

862205,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B00067BBLY,Jeffery Mingo,"[4, 7]","If this film were Oscar-worthy, my guess is that would have been released in the winter.  So though I am guessing that it will come and go, here are some thought I have after seeing it in the theater.1.  The musical performances are sewn together well into the plot.  Usually in musicals, the numbers interrupt the flow of the dialogue.  Here, and as in real life, music is in the background undersocring what should be the main focus.  I think the performance by R&B; artists were the best, yet besides Natalie Cole, I had never heard of the other two.  I wish them well.2.  There is not enough discussion about disabled gays and lesbians, both in film and in real life.  This film continues what ""Frida"" started by showing the life of a physically-disabled gay man.  Big props for this diversity.3.  This movie will remind many of ""Far from Heaven.""  Not only does a straight wife suffer in her relationship with a gay husband, but just as FFH talked about what 1950s movies could not, Cole Porter's life and lyrics could be seen in a sexual light that past audiences may not have seen or accepted.4.  Cole's first male lover in this movie is a Russian ballet dancer who speaks some French.  A homophobic man refers to Cole as ""a fawn.""  Thus, I am sure the love interest is based upon Vaslav Nijinsky.  Though I've never heard of the two having a sexual relationship in real life, the screenwriter must be up on his ""Who's Who of Gay Historical Figures.""5.  Later in life, this movie shows Cole's wife finding a male companion for him.  If I remember correctly, one of Cole's last male lovers was abusive to him.  I wonder if the writers left that out because it would disrupt the tone of the movie or because it might come off as homophobic.6.  I mention the Oscars because actresses are often rewarded for tranformation.  So Hilary Swank is rewarded for playing a pre-op FTM in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and Charlize Theron played a working-class, Southern prostitute in ""Monster.""  In this film, ingenue Ashley Judd ages.  It's a transformation that I hope critics or award panelists remember.7.  Just as ""Red Hot & Blue"" introduced me to Cole, I wonder if a new generation of gay men and theater enthusiasts be apprised of him throuh this film.",3,okay film which makes me think a lot,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,2242,"['film', 'were', 'Oscar-worthy', 'guess', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'winter', 'am', 'guessing', 'will', 'come', 'go', 'here', 'are', 'thought', 'have', 'seeing', 'theater.1', 'musical', 'performances', 'are', 'sewn', 'together', 'well', 'plot', 'Usually', 'musicals', 'numbers', 'interrupt', 'flow', 'dialogue', 'Here', 'real', 'life', 'music', 'background', 'undersocring', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'main', 'focus', 'think', 'performance', 'R', 'B', 'artists', 'were', 'best', 'yet', 'Natalie', 'Cole', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'other', 'two', 'wish', 'well.2', 'not', 'enough', 'discussion', 'disabled', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'what', 'Frida', 'started', 'showing', 'life', 'physically-disabled', 'gay', 'man', 'Big', 'props', 'diversity.3', 'movie', 'will', 'remind', 'many', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'Not', 'only', 'straight', 'wife', 'suffer', 'relationship', 'gay', 'husband', 'just', 'FFH', 'talked', 'what', '1950s', 'movies', 'could', 'not', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'life', 'lyrics', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'sexual', 'light', 'past', 'audiences', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'accepted.4', 'Cole', 'first', 'male', 'lover', 'movie', 'Russian', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'who', 'French', 'homophobic', 'man', 'refers', 'Cole', 'fawn', 'Thus', 'am', 'sure', 'love', 'interest', 'based', 'Vaslav', 'Nijinsky', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'two', 'having', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'real', 'life', 'screenwriter', 'must', 'be', 'up', 'Who', 'Who', 'Gay', 'Historical', 'Figures.', '5', 'Later', 'life', 'movie', 'Cole', 'wife', 'finding', 'male', 'companion', 'remember', 'correctly', 'one', 'Cole', 'last', 'male', 'lovers', 'was', 'abusive', 'wonder', 'writers', 'left', 'out', 'would', 'disrupt', 'tone', 'movie', 'might', 'come', 'off', 'homophobic.6', 'mention', 'Oscars', 'actresses', 'are', 'often', 'rewarded', 'tranformation', 'So', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'rewarded', 'playing', 'pre-op', 'FTM', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'played', 'working-class', 'Southern', 'prostitute', 'Monster', 'film', 'ingenue', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'transformation', 'hope', 'critics', 'award', 'panelists', 'remember.7', 'Just', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Blue', 'introduced', 'Cole', 'wonder', 'new', 'generation', 'gay', 'men', 'theater', 'enthusiasts', 'be', 'apprised', 'throuh', 'film']",N/A

The aging of the central characters was very realistically done.  Monty Wooley was heavy-set and had a bushy beard.  Irving Berlin was a thin little shrimp.  (They got the glasses right.)  Porter himself was slight, as everyone knows.  ""So In Love"" was sung by an actress in her dressing room, it was not a courtyard duet.  ""Kiss Me Kate"" was far from Porter's last show.  Some of the flick was factual.  His button-hole, his accident (he lost both legs, not just one), his difficulty getting Kate produced (he was considered all washed up, as the film says), neglected however was the overwhelming success of this show and the fact that it's generally considered to be his masterpiece (I don't care for the music myself).  According to what reviews I read, the singers were all contemporary idols.  I didn't recognize any of them and thought they all did good jobs.  However, the tune of ""Begin the Beguine"" was altered and stylized (and this supposedly during the show it was sung in!), and the ending of it was deleted (to change the meaning of the lyric and reflect the Porter's mood at the time).  The lyric to ""Anything Goes"" is ""But now god knows..."", not ""Now heaven knows..."".  I don't see why this was laundered considering the profanity in the dialogue.  The accident was very realistically done.  An interesting legend was overlooked (since most of the movie was fiction anyway, why not have put it in?), Porter is supposed to have been conscious after the accident, and while waiting for help, wrote the lyric to ""At Long Last Love.""  I liked the homosexuality, the relationship with his wife, the feelings and attitude of his wife (all of course left out of the Cary Grant flick, next Rodgers and Hart, I hope), the general concept of seeing his life through his songs in a theater, and moving back and forth between on and off stage - though the whole thing was illusion.  Finally it's a wonder everyone in the film didn't fall over dead from tobacco smoke (the actress who played his wife who died apparently of lung cancer did not inhale I noticed, and her illness did not stop Porter (that actor did inhale) from practically chain-smoking himself), everyone in the thing had a fag between his fingers constantly.  I don't know whether I liked this flick or not, though I did finish it.  So I gave it 3 stars, knocking off 2 for accuracy and redundancy.  One last note.  The cast was filled with black people.

Essentially, although Porter was an unflinching bisexual, the movie chose to not dwell on the ""deviency"" aspect of it and the impact on his wife. His wife, nicely portrayed by Judd, knew this going into the marriage and seemed perfectly happy to have Porter as a platonic partner and friend. Porter's wife had bouts of anger on this subject, but always seemed to gravitate back towards to charming composer. It's almost strange to have a couple be so understanding despite the differences-and may not be worth the cinematic effort since there was very little drama involved in the sexual conflict.Do notice the makeup of Kline in his later years.

862215,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00067BBLY,Kenji Fujishima,"[2, 3]","The best thing that can be said about DE-LOVELY is that it makes me want to learn more about American composer Cole Porter and listen to more of his magical songs. Perhaps, by doing my own research, I could probably get a better sense of what made Porter's life so special than from director Irwin Winkler's rhythmless, hollow biopic.Oh, it's not a bad movie, I suppose. It takes a potentially refreshing approach to Porter's life, turning it into a musical, and trying to show how his life might have inspired what he wrote. It has an interesting framing device: an aged Porter himself is in some alternate dimension watches his own life flash by as some kind of angel (Jonathan Pryce) watches over the proceedings. At least Winkler mostly resists cutting away from the various musical performances in the movie, so we can savor the glorious songs in their entirety (most of the time, anyway). Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd give likable, charismatic performances as Porter and his wife Linda, respectively (and, as they get older, they are saddled with some convincing make-up). And the movie certainly looks nice---classy, as befitted Porter himself.The result of the high production values, great songs, and watchable performances, though, add up to a surprisingly dull biopic. One problem is with the modern musical performances of Porter's songs that are so awkwardly thrown into the movie. The performances aren't bad, I guess---Robbie Williams does well by ""It's De-Lovely,"" for example, but who thought Alanis Morrissette would be any good for ""Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)""?---but overall I would have been fine if I had just heard original records on the soundtrack, instead of these distracting, uneven modern interpretations. But a more fatal flaw to DE-LOVELY is that the movie never really gives us any insight into what makes Porter's life---or even his music---so special. There are some hints of Porter's homosexuality here, but they are so coyly pursued that perhaps someone who didn't know any better would probably forget all about his homosexual side after the movie was over. Instead, Winkler and Jay Cocks, who wrote the film's mediocre dialogue, focus all their attention on the great, long-lasting love between Porter and Linda. Their relationship goes through the usual tensions, and it never fascinates for a second, the way these filmmakers tell it. Admittedly, the movie does become more touching towards the end, when Linda is struck by lung cancer and Porter's legs become crushed in an unfortunate riding accident. But this sudden rush of real sympathy and emotion for these real-life characters is not enough to save what is one of the least electrifying biopics I have seen in quite a while, one that mistakes Porter's sheer elegance of style for insight into the man himself.At least, though, the greatness of Porter's music survives. If you dare watch DE-LOVELY, at least by the end you'll find yourself wanting to get a CD of Porter's songs and hearing what the big deal about them is. You won't really get that kind of insight from this plodding mess of a movie.",3,"A rhythmless biopic, though at least the music survives",1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,3102,"['best', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'DE-LOVELY', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'American', 'composer', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'listen', 'more', 'magical', 'songs', 'Perhaps', 'doing', 'own', 'research', 'could', 'probably', 'get', 'better', 'sense', 'what', 'made', 'Porter', 'life', 'so', 'special', 'director', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', 'rhythmless', 'hollow', 'biopic.Oh', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'suppose', 'potentially', 'refreshing', 'approach', 'Porter', 'life', 'turning', 'musical', 'trying', 'show', 'how', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'inspired', 'what', 'wrote', 'interesting', 'framing', 'device', 'aged', 'Porter', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'own', 'life', 'flash', 'kind', 'angel', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'proceedings', 'least', 'Winkler', 'mostly', 'cutting', 'away', 'various', 'musical', 'performances', 'movie', 'can', 'savor', 'glorious', 'songs', 'entirety', 'most', 'time', 'anyway', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'give', 'likable', 'charismatic', 'performances', 'Porter', 'wife', 'Linda', 'respectively', 'get', 'older', 'are', 'saddled', 'convincing', 'make-up', 'movie', 'certainly', 'nice', '-classy', 'befitted', 'Porter', 'himself.The', 'result', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'great', 'songs', 'watchable', 'performances', 'add', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'dull', 'biopic', 'One', 'problem', 'modern', 'musical', 'performances', 'Porter', 'songs', 'are', 'so', 'awkwardly', 'thrown', 'movie', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'guess', '-Robbie', 'Williams', 'well', 'De-Lovely', 'example', 'who', 'thought', 'Alanis', 'Morrissette', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'Let', 'Do', 'Let', 'Fall', 'Love', 'overall', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'had', 'just', 'heard', 'original', 'records', 'soundtrack', 'instead', 'distracting', 'uneven', 'modern', 'interpretations', 'more', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'DE-LOVELY', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'insight', 'what', 'Porter', 'life', '-or', 'even', 'music', '-so', 'special', 'are', 'hints', 'Porter', 'homosexuality', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'coyly', 'pursued', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'would', 'probably', 'forget', 'homosexual', 'side', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'Instead', 'Winkler', 'Jay', 'Cocks', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'mediocre', 'dialogue', 'focus', 'attention', 'great', 'long-lasting', 'love', 'Porter', 'Linda', 'relationship', 'usual', 'tensions', 'never', 'second', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'tell', 'Admittedly', 'movie', 'become', 'more', 'touching', 'end', 'when', 'Linda', 'struck', 'lung', 'cancer', 'Porter', 'legs', 'become', 'crushed', 'unfortunate', 'riding', 'accident', 'sudden', 'rush', 'real', 'sympathy', 'emotion', 'real-life', 'characters', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'what', 'one', 'least', 'electrifying', 'biopics', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'one', 'Porter', 'sheer', 'elegance', 'style', 'insight', 'man', 'himself.At', 'least', 'though', 'greatness', 'Porter', 'music', 'dare', 'watch', 'DE-LOVELY', 'least', 'end', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wanting', 'get', 'CD', 'Porter', 'songs', 'hearing', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'kind', 'insight', 'plodding', 'mess', 'movie']",N/A
862216,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00067BBLY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","The musical biography is always a hit-or-miss genre for me. These pictures can be effective, but oftentimes lack dramatic heft as we move through the years. It's a Cliff's Notes version of someone's life only stopping for the dramatic scene or recognizable milestone. Recently, I've seen two films structured so similarly that they almost require comparison: Kevin Spacey's loveletter to Bobby Darin ""Beyond the Sea"" and ""de-Lovely"", the story of Cole Porter.Both films use an interesting framing device. Bobby is in a fantasy movie set recreating the highlights of his life and Cole is in a fantasy theater recalling his legacy. Both use relevant music to dramatize significant events and link passages of time. And both come to the end with an imagined, jubilant musical number to play us out.Here's the thing. When looking at a biographical movie, I have to ask myself two questions. Is the person relevant enough to merit a full blown film? And is there enough of interest to warrant that film? Here is where these film diverge, because I think Bobby Darin's story just isn't that interesting or significant. Sorry. Cole Porter, however, was a talent ahead of his time that led a pretty daring lifestyle.""Beyond the Sea"" was problematic from the beginning. Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly a talented actor, he severely miscast himself here. Everyone knows it and the film even winkingly acknowledges the fact that he's way too old. But forgiving that, the film glosses over the dramatic points. A childhood deadly disease--song--Sandra Dee doesn't like him--song--problems in the marriage--song--a neglected child--song. No issue is ever handled effectively by the script, instead a musical video number comes along and the problem doesn't exist anymore. Still as trite entertainment, the film was fine initially--but the longer it goes on, the more self important it becomes. Then boom, let's call that illness up again and end this picture with a showstopper. Even Bobby Darin knew he was obsolete by the end of the sixties, so I'm not sure why I'd care 40 years later anyway.""de-Lovely"" was more of a surprise. Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd are in fine form, and the movie allows them to ACT! There is much more story here as Porter was an influential figure in theater and film--and more drama in his personal side from his double life, sex clubs, loss of limb, etc. The film isn't perfect, however, it presents the more controversial aspects of Porter--but never really handles them in an anything but polite manner. And the movie lags toward the end, which is more forgivable because you've actually come to care about these characters.OK, music: One of these films has contemporary stars like Diana Krall, Robbie Williams, Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow and many others giving elegant spins to classic numbers. The appearance of these performers adds a nice touch to the musical segues. And John Barrowman's ""Night and Day"" is an absolute showstopper! The other film handles the musical interludes a bit differently. In it, we get the limited appeal of Kevin Spacey singing and dancing and singing and dancing. It's fine, but hardly the stuff to make young girls all aflutter. I'll leave you to figure out which is which.The final number in each: ""de-Lovely"" brings everyone in the entire cast together for one more celebration of Cole Porter's music. ""Beyond The Sea"" offers one more self-indulgent song and dance from Mr. Spacey. Look, ""de-Lovely"" obviously is the movie I prefer--it's a solid four stars. ""Beyond The Sea"" started out as a three star film because of its harmlessness but sinks to one star by the end due to its own pretensions.

In one of the featurettes on the DVD, the musical director explains that he wanted the song to reflect what was happening in Porter's life at the time.  BUT HE RE-WROTE THE SONG!!!!  And, evidently, the Porter Estate was cool with that.  Maybe they were, but I'm not.  You simply do not re-write a Cole Porter song; to do so takes unbelievable gall.  As far as I'm concerned, it seriously damages what overall is a pretty good movie.

Bernabo,"[119, 136]","""When they begin the beguineIt brings back the sound of music so tender,It brings back a night of tropical splendor,It brings back a memory ever green.""When ""De-Lovely"" begins it is October 15, 1964 and Cole Porter (Kevin Kline) is about to die.  This requires his life to flash before his eyes, but since we are talking Cole Porter this means there are all sorts of creative decisions involved in this final production.  The conceit of the film is that Porter is sitting in the first theater that he visited while growing in Peru, Indiana, with ""Gabe"" (Jonathan Pryce) at his side.  The result is not a musical but rather a musical biography, which is why we do not go back to Porter's childhood but rather to the moment that the gay songwriter met the love of his life, the divorcee Linda Lee (Ashley Judd), who would become his wife.""And that's why birds do it, bees do itEven educated fleas do itLet's do it, let's fall in love.""Cole and Linda marry, equally aware of the strengths as well as the weaknesses of their relationship.  Linda was more than a front of respectability for Cole's homosexuality; she was his muse.  ""De-Lovely"" abandons the traditions of a bio-pic in terms of places and dates to focus more on the songs Cole Porter wrote.  Kevin Kline is a piano player, and he uses this talent to great affect in the film.  Cole is often sitting at the piano composing the music of his life and it compels us to listen again to the familiar lyrics, but this time in the context of his life.  The recurring thought is not that he is writing all of these songs to reflect himself, but that there are times when the songs are clearly for her.""Every time we say goodbye, I die a little,Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.Think so little of me, they allow you to go.""You can try and tell the story of Cole Porter's life, but it is always going to come back to his music.  After all, it is a song that attracts Linda to Cole and teaching someone to sing ""Night and Day"" that shows Porter at his seductive best.  However, when you have Cole Porter's songs being sung by the likes of Elvis Costello, Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Dianna Krall, Robbie Williams, and Natalie Cole, it is not surprising that those songs once again take the spotlight away from the man who wrote them.  I was rather surprised that I recognized every single song played in ""De-Lovely,"" but then that only serves to underscore that Cole Porter is one of the greatest American songwriters.""You're the Top! You're the colosseum,You're the Top! You're the louve museum,You're a melody from a symphony, by Strauss,You're a Bandle bonnet, a Shakspeare sonnet,You're Mickey mouse.You're the Nile, You're the Towr of Pisa,You're the smile on the Mona Lisa;Im a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,But if Baby, Im the bottom,You're the top!""Director Irwin Winkler's 2004 film has the advantage of not only Porter's music but of Kline's performance, although obviously the actor needs to tone down his singing considerably (we get to hear Porter himself singing at the start of the final credits).  Judd, who usually refrains from singing in public to avoid comparison to her mother and sister, does a couple of songs as well.  You can also throw in the exquisite period costumes courtesy of Armani that help to define Porter as the paradigm of wit and urbane sophistication before the riding accident that crippled him.  The film keeps trying to suggest that ""Let's Misbehave!"" is the de facto Cole Porter theme song, but in the end the man and his music both speak to more optimistic sentiments.""The world has gone mad todayAnd good's bad today,And black's white today,And day's night today,When most guys todayThat women prize todayAre just silly gigolosAnd though I'm not a great romancerI know that I'm bound to answerWhen you propose,Anything goes.""",4,"Songs don't need to be about somebody, but they usually are",1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,3894,"['When', 'begin', 'beguineIt', 'back', 'sound', 'music', 'tender', 'back', 'night', 'tropical', 'splendor', 'back', 'memory', 'ever', 'green', 'When', 'De-Lovely', 'October', '15', '1964', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'die', 'life', 'flash', 'eyes', 'are', 'talking', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'are', 'sorts', 'creative', 'decisions', 'involved', 'final', 'production', 'conceit', 'film', 'Porter', 'sitting', 'first', 'theater', 'visited', 'growing', 'Peru', 'Indiana', 'Gabe', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'side', 'result', 'not', 'musical', 'rather', 'musical', 'biography', 'why', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'Porter', 'childhood', 'rather', 'moment', 'gay', 'songwriter', 'met', 'love', 'life', 'divorcee', 'Linda', 'Lee', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'wife', 'why', 'birds', 'do', 'do', 'itEven', 'educated', 'fleas', 'do', 'itLet', 'do', 'let', 'fall', 'love', 'Cole', 'Linda', 'marry', 'equally', 'aware', 'strengths', 'as', 'well', 'weaknesses', 'relationship', 'Linda', 'was', 'more', 'front', 'respectability', 'Cole', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'muse', 'De-Lovely', 'traditions', 'bio-pic', 'terms', 'places', 'dates', 'focus', 'more', 'songs', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'wrote', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'piano', 'player', 'talent', 'great', 'affect', 'film', 'Cole', 'often', 'sitting', 'piano', 'composing', 'music', 'life', 'listen', 'again', 'familiar', 'lyrics', 'time', 'context', 'life', 'recurring', 'thought', 'not', 'writing', 'songs', 'reflect', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'songs', 'are', 'clearly', 'Every', 'time', 'say', 'goodbye', 'die', 'little', 'Every', 'time', 'say', 'goodbye', 'wonder', 'why', 'little', 'Why', 'Gods', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'know.Think', 'so', 'little', 'allow', 'go', 'can', 'try', 'tell', 'story', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'life', 'always', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'music', 'song', 'Linda', 'Cole', 'teaching', 'someone', 'sing', 'Night', 'Day', 'Porter', 'seductive', 'best', 'However', 'when', 'have', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'songs', 'being', 'sung', 'likes', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Dianna', 'Krall', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'Natalie', 'Cole', 'not', 'surprising', 'songs', 'once', 'again', 'take', 'spotlight', 'away', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'recognized', 'single', 'song', 'played', 'De-Lovely', 'then', 'only', 'underscore', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'songwriters', ""'re"", 'Top', ""'re"", 'colosseum', ""'re"", 'Top', ""'re"", 'louve', 'museum', ""'re"", 'melody', 'symphony', 'Strauss', ""'re"", 'Bandle', 'bonnet', 'Shakspeare', 'sonnet', ""'re"", 'Mickey', 'mouse.You', ""'re"", 'Nile', ""'re"", 'Towr', 'Pisa', ""'re"", 'smile', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Im', 'worthless', 'check', 'total', 'wreck', 'flop', 'Baby', 'Im', 'bottom', ""'re"", 'top', 'Director', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', '2004', 'film', 'advantage', 'not', 'only', 'Porter', 'music', 'Kline', 'performance', 'obviously', 'actor', 'tone', 'down', 'singing', 'considerably', 'get', 'hear', 'Porter', 'singing', 'start', 'final', 'credits', 'Judd', 'who', 'usually', 'singing', 'public', 'avoid', 'comparison', 'mother', 'sister', 'couple', 'songs', 'well', 'can', 'also', 'throw', 'exquisite', 'period', 'costumes', 'courtesy', 'Armani', 'help', 'define', 'Porter', 'paradigm', 'wit', 'urbane', 'sophistication', 'riding', 'accident', 'crippled', 'film', 'trying', 'suggest', 'Let', 'Misbehave', 'de', 'facto', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'theme', 'song', 'end', 'man', 'music', 'speak', 'more', 'optimistic', 'sentiments', 'world', 'gone', 'mad', 'todayAnd', 'good', 'bad', 'today', 'black', 'white', 'today', 'day', 'night', 'today', 'When', 'most', 'guys', 'todayThat', 'women', 'prize', 'todayAre', 'just', 'silly', 'gigolosAnd', ""'m"", 'not', 'great', 'romancerI', 'know', ""'m"", 'bound', 'answerWhen', 'propose', 'Anything']",N/A
862221,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00067BBLY,Lawyeraau,"[3, 4]","This film is an interesting bio-pic of noted songwriter Cole Porter. As with so many bio-pics, an individual's life is crammed into a set time constraint. Naturally, much of the individual's life is reduced to glimpses of highlights, important events, and significant others that give the viewer the flavor of that person's life, rather than a real blow-by-blow description. This film is no different.In looking at Cole Porter's life, the film weaves in the wonderful music he wrote, and it is wonderful hearing it sung by contemporary artists. It is nice to know that a new generation will have an opportunity to hear Porter's music through this film. The film itself is a high-end production with wonderful period costumes, lavish sets, and musical numbers that ground the film in the era out of which it arose. Told in flashback, with terrific actor Jonathan Pryce in the role of the Angel Gabriel as Master of Ceremony, the viewers sees Cole Porter looking at his life retrospectively and watches his life unfold along with him.Cole Porter is played by Kevin Kline, who does a yeoman's job as the talented songwriter that dazzled the music world in his time. While some have commented on the fact that Kevin Kline's singing voice is not up to par for the role, the viewer should keep in mind that he is playing the role of a songwriter and not that of a singer. It is the music that he wrote, and not the music that he sang, that made Cole Porter famous. So, Kevin Kline's voice is in tune with the role he is playing, and playing it magnificently, at that.Ashley Judd is lovely as Linda, Cole Porter's wife and life-long companion. Hers is a sensitive portrayal of a worldly woman who fell in love with Cole Porter, the songwriter, only to realize later that Cole Porter, the man, was sexually attracted to other men. Still, these two managed to form a union that would endure and ultimately flourish, despite this elemental issue. Theirs was a bond fraught with understanding, deep love, and true friendship. It was one that would ultimately survive, despite Porter's sexual proclivities and Linda's occasional frustration with the status quo. Companions to the end,  the film's treatment of their relationship is sensitive and delicate.Cole Porter's music is interwoven throughout the entire film, along with some wonderful musical numbers, although I wonder at the omission of one of his most popular standards, ""I've Got You Under My Skin"". As his life unrolls in flashback fashion, almost as if it were a film within a film,  the viewer is able to witness Cole Porter's popularity with cafe society, his rise to fame and fortune, his complex relationship with and his marriage to Linda, his homosexual escapades and affairs, and the riding accident that left him physically challenged to the end of his life.This is an entertaining film, filled with some of the best music written in the twentieth century. While the film may not be to everyone's taste, it is certainly worth a rental, at the very least. Those who opt to view this film will be treated to a deftly directed, quality production, well-acted by a stellar cast, a glimpse into the life of a conflicted and talented individual, and wonderful music, beautifully interpreted and sung by contemporary musical artists.",4,DE-LIGHTFUL...,1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,3286,"['film', 'interesting', 'bio-pic', 'noted', 'songwriter', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'so', 'many', 'bio-pics', 'individual', 'life', 'crammed', 'set', 'time', 'constraint', 'Naturally', 'much', 'individual', 'life', 'reduced', 'glimpses', 'highlights', 'important', 'events', 'significant', 'others', 'give', 'viewer', 'flavor', 'person', 'life', 'rather', 'real', 'blow-by-blow', 'description', 'film', 'different.In', 'looking', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'life', 'film', 'weaves', 'wonderful', 'music', 'wrote', 'wonderful', 'hearing', 'sung', 'contemporary', 'artists', 'nice', 'know', 'new', 'generation', 'will', 'have', 'opportunity', 'hear', 'Porter', 'music', 'film', 'film', 'high-end', 'production', 'wonderful', 'period', 'costumes', 'lavish', 'sets', 'musical', 'numbers', 'ground', 'film', 'era', 'arose', 'Told', 'flashback', 'terrific', 'actor', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'role', 'Angel', 'Gabriel', 'Master', 'Ceremony', 'viewers', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'looking', 'life', 'retrospectively', 'watches', 'life', 'unfold', 'him.Cole', 'Porter', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'who', 'yeoman', 'job', 'talented', 'songwriter', 'dazzled', 'music', 'world', 'time', 'have', 'commented', 'fact', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'singing', 'voice', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'role', 'viewer', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'playing', 'role', 'songwriter', 'not', 'singer', 'music', 'wrote', 'not', 'music', 'sang', 'made', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'famous', 'So', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'voice', 'tune', 'role', 'playing', 'playing', 'magnificently', 'that.Ashley', 'Judd', 'lovely', 'Linda', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'wife', 'life-long', 'companion', 'Hers', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'worldly', 'woman', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'songwriter', 'only', 'realize', 'later', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'man', 'was', 'sexually', 'attracted', 'other', 'men', 'Still', 'two', 'managed', 'form', 'union', 'would', 'endure', 'ultimately', 'flourish', 'elemental', 'issue', 'Theirs', 'was', 'bond', 'fraught', 'understanding', 'deep', 'love', 'true', 'friendship', 'was', 'one', 'would', 'ultimately', 'survive', 'Porter', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'Linda', 'occasional', 'frustration', 'status', 'quo', 'Companions', 'end', 'film', 'treatment', 'relationship', 'sensitive', 'delicate.Cole', 'Porter', 'music', 'interwoven', 'entire', 'film', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'numbers', 'wonder', 'omission', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'standards', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Skin', 'life', 'unrolls', 'flashback', 'fashion', 'almost', 'were', 'film', 'film', 'viewer', 'able', 'witness', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'popularity', 'cafe', 'society', 'rise', 'fame', 'fortune', 'complex', 'relationship', 'marriage', 'Linda', 'homosexual', 'escapades', 'affairs', 'riding', 'accident', 'left', 'physically', 'challenged', 'end', 'life.This', 'entertaining', 'film', 'filled', 'best', 'music', 'written', 'twentieth', 'century', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'certainly', 'worth', 'rental', 'very', 'least', 'who', 'opt', 'view', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'deftly', 'directed', 'quality', 'production', 'well-acted', 'stellar', 'cast', 'glimpse', 'life', 'conflicted', 'talented', 'individual', 'wonderful', 'music', 'beautifully', 'interpreted', 'sung', 'contemporary', 'musical', 'artists']",N/A

I'll add my reactions to this chorus.First of all, I thought it was a pretty bad movie.  There was no one to root for, no one to like, no one to care about.  The relationship between Cole and Linda was a bunch of nothing, and annoying as well.Here is Cole Porter, a homosexual who is fond of his wife Linda.  Stuff it.  What kind of artificial marriage is this.  A bunch of baloney.There are no interesting scenes between these two lovebirds.  None.  There isn't one moment that I felt was real.  When Cole told Linda of his love for her, I felt like saying oh shut up.  Why Linda was hung up on him escapes me.There were no relationships between Cole and his male lovers either.  He really didn't connect with anyone emotionally in the entire movie.  If he has no emotions, then why should I care about him.  He is tiresome.The only happy event in the entire movie is the song Blow Gabriel Blow.  Why?  Because it means Cole Porter will die already.  Great.  What a relief.As for the musical numbers, they were excellent.  The reviewers who panned Alanis Morissette don't know what they are talking about and are tasteless snobs.  She did a great job, a really great job on her Cole Porter song.  All of the stars did.The music is terrific, but unfortunately it is weighted down with the bricks of a dead script in which nothing at all of interest happens.It's not that the movie is too long.  It is, but that is beside the point.  The movie is burdensome.  Ten minutes would have been too long.Ashley Judd is likeable as Linda.  Kevin Kline is annoying as Cole.  Who wants to see Cary Grant again.  The only person who can pull that off without making you sick is Cary Grant himself.  Kevin Kline is a tiresome Cary Grant with no joy.I find it odd that the other reviewers on this site criticize Ashley and praise Kevin.  Why?  What movie were you watching?  Ashley wasn't terrible despite a script that is a load.  I guess that's the best I can say about the acting.  Here's my Ebert and Roper type quote.

862225,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00067BBLY,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 2]","This is the story of Cole Porter, as played by Kevin Kline, told through the device of his life as a musical.  At first this turned me off.  After all, I don't like musicals.  But five minutes into the story and I was hooked.  And then I sat there spellbound for the next two hours as one familiar tune after another shaped Cole Porter's world and made the man and his passions come to life.The film starts in the Paris of the 20s, when American ex-patriots had a grand old time going to parties and spending money.  They dress in great clothes and smoke a lot of cigarettes and it seems they do nothing but play.  Its here he meets his future wife, the lovely Linda Lee played by Ashley Judd.  She's been recently divorced and Cole is immediately attracted to her.  There's a very special connection between them that will last a lifetime, even though they will never been a typical couple.  It's true that Cole loves her deeply but he also likes men and never stops indulging those desires.The couple is filthy rich.  Not only do they both have money in their own right, but Cole is a very successful songwriter and these wonderful songs are performed throughout in a way that moves along the plot as the lyrics supplement the dialog for further insight into the characters.We watch the couple travel.  From Paris to New York to Hollywood and back again.  They are enormously successful and always well dressed but there is also angst in their relationship, especially when Cole runs off for his little flings and when a pregnancy that they want so much results in a miscarriage.  However, it is absolutely clear that they are true lovers in every sense of the world.Tragedy strikes though.  Cole is thrown from a horse and his legs are crushed.  He spends the last 25 years of his life going through multiple operations and eventually having a leg amputated.  Linda's cigarette smoking, which was once an symbol of freedom, turns to disease and eventually kills her.  And somehow, the writers of this film managed to get this all in against the background of familiar tunes that are so entrenched into American culture that they are part of me as well.

These are the words of Cole Porter (a bi-sexual who prefers men) played so aptly by Kevin Kline in De-Lovely.  He is referring to his first intimate evening with his future wife - Linda, so well protrayed by the beautiful and captivating, Ashley Judd. These two make beautiful music together and dance out a wonderful love story.From the moment the movie began to the last zoom out portrait of the leads, who are  shall we say, unusual lovers - I was astounded myself by: the story, the music, the scenery, the wit, the supporting cast(Jonathan Pryce is wonderful), and the way it all flowed together in a sometimes flawed but creative manner.Memories of the old flick, ""Night and Day"" in which Cole was played by Cary Grant and Linda by Alexis Smith(two of my favorite oldies and goodies) were fresh because we had rented that tape a month or so ago.  I also remember when ""Night and Day"" was originally released in the forties and I went home to sing, ""You're the Top"" to my little pet dog.  I can still see her dancing around with that little black tail a wagging.My heart was glad again this time around but in a very adult and sometimes poignant manner.  In the first film I could never figure out why Cole and Linda separated, but this version makes it quite clear.  It is a kind of relationship twist heart rendering and real.The musical numbers with and without professionals performing were excellent.  It is hard to do Porter wrong unless you are very bad..His music just is.....GREAT.  One of my favorite scenes was not a staged musical number at all, but takes place during a rehearsal when Porter helps a young singer get just the right nuance in his singing of ""Night and Day.""  It builds and builds until it hits the part where...NIGHT and DAY is sung by the two of them.  I felt lifted off my seat...so good and so intensely beautiful.When the credits roll at the end, many of the audience in our theater  sat starring at the screen, listening intently to the voice of the real Cole Porter singing on a scratchy 1930's recording of...""You're the Top, you're Mahatma Gandhi, you're the top, you're Napoleon Brandy....""  Those  people who  began to exit  stopped once more to watch and listen.  I said to my husband.  ""They don't want to leave.""

862235,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B00067BBLY,Mary Whipple,"[12, 13]","This often fascinating portrait of songwriter Cole Porter, directed by Irwin Winkler, puts many of Porter's most famous songs into the context of his life. But that life, as seen in this filmscript by Jay Cocks, is full of contradictions, and the viewer ultimately comes away from the film familiar with many aspects of Porter's life but with little sense of the whole. Well worth seeing for Porter's wonderful music, and for the on-screen solos by contemporary stars like Diana Krall, Natalie Cole, Alanis Morrissette, and Sheryl Crow--the film ultimately fails to give much insight into the complexity of the man, his marriage, or his career.Part of the difficulty lies in the structure of the film, which opens with two aged men, one of them obviously Porter (Kevin Kline), the other a director (Jonathan Pryce), sitting in front of an empty stage on which scenes from Porter's life and music unfold. Though this device gives a frame to the action, it is intrusive, constantly shifting attention from emotional and tension-filled scenes back to the two old men, who just stand, observe, and occasionally comment. This kills the tension and prevents the audience from developing any sustained personal identification with the characters from episode to episode.Porter, a bisexual, is shown from the outset as a devoted partner to Linda (Ashley Judd), the supportive and loving woman who becomes his wife, helpmate, and, in some ways, guiding spirit, though she is aware of his attraction for men and often finds herself alone. Recognizing his love for her, she tolerates his dalliances (for reasons that are unclear here), and as the audience sees Cole and Linda subtly aging (remarkably well done by Make-up Director Sarah Monzani) and observes their increasingly ostentatious lifestyle, they also see Cole welcoming the stability Linda gives his life. Kevin Kline is a rather phlegmatic Cole Porter, but he exudes charm, and in his lack of good singing voice, he parallels Porter himself. Ashley Judd is terrific as Linda, very relaxed and confident in her role and able to convey in a glance her love and concern.The photography (Tony Pierce-Roberts) adds to the period flavor throughout--bright, colorful, and sometimes frenetic, when the mood calls for it, with one scene that fades from color to black and white for dramatic effect. Ultimately, the viewer gains some information about Porter and his life and has a fine time listening to the music and watching the dancing, but the man himself remains an enigma.

This is one of the first movies in recent months where I just couldn't get my head around it: is it the silly frame story device, the stagey dialogue, or the musical numbers that come off as what they are - age-demographic gimmicks? I sat through almost two hours of the movie with a look of befuddlement on my face, because De-Lovely, even with the great Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd (not in a stupid thriller for once), radiates mediocrity with every song-and-dance step. A movie away from which you should stay at least ten miles? No (do that for Troy or Two Brothers). De-Lovely isn't exactly a trainwreck (though a few musical numbers came close), but one of those crash-test-dummy videos. You know what's happening is really bad, yet you don't feel bad for watching because no one's getting hurt.

Which just goes to show you that it's not so much  the life itself but how you present it, that matters.""De-Lovely"" is a big over-stuffed cream puff of a movie that tries to make Cole Porter into a hero but fails. What director Irwin Winkler fails to realize is that all he needs to do is to step back and let Porter's music speak for itself. Porter is and will always be among the Pantheon of American song writers and whether he was gay or straight or slightly bent doesn't amount to a hill of pinto beans when you take his music into account: he is/was a Master!Kevin Kline does his best to personify a Legend but it is Ashley Judd who really comes across as a living, breathing human being in her lovely, tragic Linda Porter, though Winkler also tries to make her into a hero because she ""sacrificed"" her self and her life to Cole's talent.

862238,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,B00067BBLY,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[0, 0]","As the story of Cole Porter, DE-LOVELY is perhaps the best, most imaginative movie musical biography ever made.  Unlike NIGHT AND DAY, the 1946 whitewashed Porter biography that starred Cary Grant and Alexis Smith, this film presents the composer with all his warts exposed.In other words, the Irwin Winkler-directed movie deals frankly with Porter's bi-sexual lifestyle, which often was quite indiscreet.Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd are deeply moving as Porter and his patient, loving wife, Linda.  Both deliver Oscar-caliber performances.From Paris to Venice to Broadway to Hollywood, the Porters lived a glamorous and wildly unconventional existence that the composer boasted about in such chic songs as ""Let's Misbehave"" and ""Anything Goes"".The film begins with Porter as a bitter old man, visited by a mysterious figure (Jonathan Pryce) who we soon surmise is the Angel of Death.  Suddenly, the two men are in an empty ragtag theater where Porter's life is presented to him as a musical revue that features his friends, both living and dead.  The songs lead us into flashbacks of Porter's life, with the emphasis on his great love for Linda, who died many years earlier.Many of the songs in the film are performed by some of today's most popular recording artists, including Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Natalie Cole, Robbie Williams, Diana Krall and Alanis Morissette.  However, the two most memorable numbers are ""Be a Clown,"" sung by Kline in a scene set on the MGM Studio lot, and the very emotional ""Blow, Gabriel, Blow, sung by Pryce and the entire cast.The DVD from MGM/UA Home Entertainment has many extras: audio commentaries with Winkler, Kline and writer Jay Cocks, several ""Making of"" featurettes, including one that deals with the staging of the ""Be a Clown"" number, deleted scenes and an alternate ending.

862241,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00067BBLY,mirasreviews,"[6, 7]","""De-Lovely"" is a biopic that plays tribute to its subject while it tells his story. It's the story of Jazz Age playboy and revered composer/lyricist Cole Porter. We first meet Porter (Kevin Kline) just before he dies, and watch as his adult life plays out before his eyes, like scenes in one of his musicals, directed by the angel (Jonathan Pryce) sent to claim him. It starts in Paris in 1919, where Porter met his wife, the beautiful divorc&eacute;e Linda Lee (Ashley Judd), who would become his inspiration. It follows the couple to Venice, New York, Hollywood, and Massachusetts, over the course of their 35-year marriage, as Porter writes music, becomes the toast of a few towns, carries on dalliances with any number of men, is crippled by a riding accident in 1937, up until his death in 1964. ""De-Lovely"" is part musical and part love story, as it focuses on Porter's music and on his relationship with Linda, who was his life's great love in spite of his preference for men. This isn't really a character study, as we see of Porter only what is revealed through his professional and marital life.""De-Lovely"" is stylish to put it mildly. I have to admire screenwriter Jay Cocks' imagination and director Irwin Winkler's coup in pulling it off. On top of having a bizarre narrative device in an angel/director guiding us through Cole Porter's life as it plays out on stage, ""De-Lovely"" is a musical where characters sometimes burst into song. Some of Cole Porter's songs are performed onstage by contemporary artists, such as Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morrisette, Elvis Costello, Vivian Green, Natalie Cole, Robbie Williams, and Diana Krall. Sometimes I found this distracting; sometimes not. But I was particularly -and surprisingly- impressed by Alanis Morrisette's rendition of ""Let's Do It"". At least 30 songs are performed in the film, although not all in their entirety. Kevin Kline reminds us that he's not just a great actor: He sings, dances, and plays the piano as Porter. Ashley Judd is radiant and full of life as Linda, whose marriage to Cole suffered more for his selfishness than his homosexuality. The conglomeration of good drama, musical production numbers, new arrangements of Porter's songs (by Stephen Endelman), a fantastical narrative device, and one lengthy continuous shot that involved numerous off-camera costume changes and ridiculously complex lighting demonstrates that ""De-Lovely"" is as much about style as substance. Occasionally, the stylistic devices trip over one another, and I think the film is 15 minutes too long. But it's creative and entertaining, and Cole Porter might even have approved.The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, 2 ""Anatomy of a Scene"" documentaries, 9 deleted scenes, a ""De-Lovely Soundtrack TV Spot"", a theatrical trailer, and 2 audio commentaries. ""Making of De-Lovely"" (25 minutes) addresses various aspects of the film including music and characters through interviews with director Irwin Winkler, representatives of The Cole Porter Trust, the film's cast and producers, and members of its creative team. It includes an interview with designer Giorgio Armani, who made the film's costumes. ""Music of De-Lovely"" (15 minutes) focuses on the performances of the contemporary artists in the film and includes interviews with Elvis Costello, Robbie Williams, Diana Krall, Alanis Morrisette, Natalie Cole, and Sheryl Crow. The 2 ""Anatomy of a Scene"" documentaries analyze the ""Be a Clown"" production number (5 minutes) and the ""Love For Sale"" continuous nightclub shot (3 minutes), which is quite remarkable. The first audio commentary is by director Irwin Winkler and Kevin Kline. It concentrates on Kline's experiences while filming, with Winkler filling in some info for scenes that don't involve Kline as well as explaining the choices he made in telling the story. The second audio commentary is by Irwin Winkler and screenwriter Jay Cocks. This is more about characters and themes and includes some additional information about Porter and his contemporaries.

862246,AQ81HZS5XRNPL,B00067BBLY,"MrsJenBardall ""Jen""","[6, 8]","Since I first saw it in the theater, De-Lovely has grown on me.  When I first saw it I might have given it only 2, maybe 3 stars.  I was dissatisfied mainly by the placement of a few musical numbers, namely ""Be A Clown"" and ""Blow Gabriel Blow"".  Granted, they both served a purpose in the narrative, but seemed completely out of place and strangely staged when I viewed the film.  On the DVD, I plan to skip past them.  What also displeased me was the way many numbers seemed unnatural in the contrived way in which they were placed in the film.  During ""Swell Party"", the partygoing chorus looks completely unnatural singing a song together, they seem uncomfortable.  I couldn't relax and get into what was onscreen, and any instance during which a viewer is removed from the action onscreen is dangerous because they might have a hard time getting back into it.  What brought me back, though, were the numbers performed by today's artists such as Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow and Alanis Morisette.  I didn't think I'd like Alanis as much as I did, but she was charming.  And Costello blew me away, as did Crow.  Using modern performers to add a new dimension to the music was a stroke of genius.The heart of this film is the characters, the story, and the beautiful love songs of Cole Porter.  Ashley Judd is perfect as Linda Lee Porter, who pretends to not care that her husband can never love her as she loves him, never be a real husband to her.  Yet it's so clear she she suffers inside as time goes on.  Watch her face when, during a small party, a guest at the Porter household asks Cole what served as inspiration for a new song he just played.  She wants so badly for the answer to be ""My wife"" and is visibly crushed when she doesn't hear it, yet only the audience is aware of this, as she quickly puts on a happy face to her guests.  Another example of her longing is her simple, touching rendition of ""True Love"", during which it becomes evident to Cole that she wants a child as he sees her loving interaction with the daughter of their close friends.  Not only is she breathtakingly beautiful, she is breathtakingly real and so vulnerable even as she pretends to not be hurt by Cole's being unable to love her as a woman.Kevin Kline takes so many risks in this film, as Porter is portrayed as being at times selfish, overly self-indulgent, and absorbed in his own talent.  But what talent he had.  It is said that Irving Berlin would marvel at Porter's ability to whip up a tune seemingly out of nowhere, when he would labor over a tune for ages.  What this film does very well is walk the tightrope between showcasing Porter's undeniable genius and exposing him as being merely human.  Many biopics tend to idealize their subject, especially if the subject has such mythical stature as Porter.  This movie does not go that route, and that's a good thing.Yet this is still a love story, as it is clear that Cole loves Linda more deeply and with more feeling than anyone else in his life.

He's someone I only heard about occasionally, and I was familiar with a few songs of his.  Since I generally enjoy ""bio-pics"", I'm willing to watch movies about real life people and if the film intrigues me enough, I'll seek out books to learn more about the person.This film has everything going for it and I give the filmmakers huge kudos for the creativity they used in bringing the life of Cole Porter to the screen.  I like how the movie was presented as a life review in the form of a stage musical, as we see the older Cole Porter being led through some of the memorable moments of his life by a figure named Gabe, who's supposed to be an angel.  The use of his music is brilliantly done and I loved his more peppy numbers.  The ballads, however, were not my favorite and tended to drag the film for me.  There were some boring moments throughout, and that's why this film, I believe could have been much better.My favorite scene is the Venetian masquerade ball, with Elvis Costello singing ""Let's Misbehave!"" while Cole Porter is dressed as a Roman Emperor and his wife Linda is Cleopatra.  The scene is a showstopper, very visual, interesting, humorous, and exceptionally well done.  The other parts of the film I like happen to correspond with the Cole Porter songs I actually love:  ""Anything Goes"" (which always reminds me of the opening scene in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", since that was the first time I ever heard that song), Robbie Williams singing ""It's De-lovely"" in his usual highly animated style, Alanis Morissette on ""Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love"" (though I still prefer Eartha Kitt's version), and the brilliant final, ""Blow, Gabriel Blow"".  That song was a perfect ending for a movie and I love that Jonathan Pryce (as Gabe) says ""never start a musical with a ballad, never end one with a ballad"" before launching into that song.  Those peppy moments help keep this film from being a total waste of time, but the rest of the movie, most of it was a bit too slow and dragged, which is partly the fault of using some of Porter's ballads.  It affected the mood of the film, and maybe that was the point.  This film does give the impression of being a perfect bi-polar film...the ""highs"" are fantastic but the ""lows"" are devastatingly depressing.

It's ""a love story, of course.  Little unconventional, but honest.""Linda Porter:  ""You don't have to love me the same way that I love you Cole.  Just love me.""I liked this movie more for what it had to say than for HOW it said it.  Cole Porter understood the importance of rhythm, swing, and genre.  This movie does not.  It is constantly out of rhythm in direction, acting, and format.  The movie editor does not understand the importance of timing between the actors' statements (but at least it's not as bad as the poor editing in Helen Hunt's ""A Good Woman"" - that film editor should have his scissors taken away).  And I've never mentioned hair and makeup, but they are awful, plastic, and fakey in this film.The screenwriter had many clever things to say, but I do not understand why he chose this plot format.  The story is told as a ""This is Your Life"", where the old Cole Porter is looking back, unable to interact with his past.  And the constant jumping out of time keeps the movie from generating emotional momentum and flow.  I think the screenplay would have been better in a straightforward narrative timeline.  The ""out of time"" POV of two old, wise crackin' men looking coyly backwards was far too ""Muppets.""  I'm rarely critical in these reviews, but the topics in the movie are of such value that I care that they were not portrayed more sensibly.

862257,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00067BBLY,Ping Lim,"[5, 6]","I was pleasantly surprised and moved by this movie.  The unconventional relationship between Linda and Cole Porter was the essence.  Despite Cole's promiscuity with men (as he's got a thirst for life and wanted to experience love in all imaginable shapes and forms), Linda stood by him.  In fact, Linda was Cole's muse and inspired him in writing many memorable songs which were depicted in movies and musicals.  It's not clear to me if Irwin, the director followed strigently to his real life or that the movie was based upon his life.  Still, the movie allowed us to catch a glimpse of the greatness of Cole.  I didn't know of Ashley Judd's depth until I watched this movie.  For a while, I gave her up for good, as she's always typecasted as a strong-willed woman.  In this sense, she's still so in this movie but in a sensitive way.  The music that accompanied this was marvellous with appearances by Alanis Morrisette, Sheryl Crowe, Diana Krall, Natalie Cole, Mick Hucknall, Robbie Williams, Peter Costello.  I was even more surprised by involvement of Giorgio Armani who provided his know-how in the tailoring of clothes worn by the cast.  Personally, I disagree with some comment about this movie being patchy.  Rather, it's quite constructive and it flowed seamlessly.  To summarise, this is a rather wonderful musical and love story combined.  I wish it could be a better success in the box office but Peter Costello said it wisely that who in this modern days know much about foxtrot?

The expectations and prejudices we carry as we experience art, including movies, can spoil the artist's perfection.  One of my daily mental exercises is to try to look at the world through eyes unencumbered by self.  Such advice would be well followed as you pop De-Lovely in the disc player.Forget your knowledge of Cole Porter, your own sexual preferences, and all of you that lives in your persona where judgement thrives.  Watch the movie with the slate of you wiped clean and you'll see the magical artistry of De-Lovely.All art is a relection of the artist's self, and De-Lovely is filled with musical, visual, and emotional art.  Facts, though necessary, can get in the way at times so I prefer a little interpretive artistic freedom by the artist.  Such is the case here concerning Cole Porter's life.The acting performances by the cast are exceptional.  Kevin Kline especially disappears into the role of Cole Porter.The sets and cinematography are rich and detailed.  One example of the cinematic art of the movie is Vivian Green's rendition of ""Love for Sale.""  The camera slowly circles a sensuous nightclub showing what is obviously several different nights, but the song is unbroken. I was surprised to learn the scene was not edited for the effect of extended time compressed into a single song.  Instead the scene was shot in one continuous take with the cast members changing clothes and set positions before the camera floated back to their moment.  The change of gowns by Vivian Green is particularly apparent.  That scene alone deserves an Academy Award.  Watch it and you'll know what I mean.The musical performances of Cole Porter's songs reflect the impact the composer had on each of the performers, and their expression of that impact adds depth to their talent.  Many of the songs are memorable when viewed from that perspective.Finally there is the love story of Linda and Cole Porter.  If you are a couple who measures your marriage in decades, still seeing the love in each other's eyes like you did the first time you met inspite of all the victories, challenges, and disappointments you've faced together, you'll understand the power of love the movie declares Linda and Cole shared.There are not too many movies I believe earn more than Amazon's five stars.

Kevin Kline hits all the right points, but it's Ashley Judd who really hits all the right nerves. A great performance. Because of the back-and-forth time transition, it's hard to criticize that ""True Love"" was nominated for an Oscar in 1957 as Best Original Song. A lot of stuff wasn't really coherent, time-wise. Still, it's always nice to hear Cole Porter music, and the film was fairly honest to Cole's life. Except for the music, and Ashley Judd's performance, the film is actually quite average. From a musical standpoint, ""Begin the Beguine"", perhaps Porter's greatest song, was done here in a minor key, and ""Be a Clown"" was never heard until 1952 when Donald O'Connor did it so well in ""Singin' in the Rain"".

""De-Lovely"" is technically a musical I suppose, but did not seem necessarily so. It was a love story too but not in the way most people would suppose. Cole Porter's riches to riches life was punctuated by a heady cornucopia of sexual experience arguably of the bi-sexual kind. His personal background is likely the well-spring of his complex and  sometimes difficult to vocalize lyrics. I found close captioning to really come into its own while viewing this work. By reading the lyrics as being sung, I developed a new found appreciation for his choice of words and phrasing. Where did he come up with those words...and oh, the content! Starring Kevin Kline as Porter and the breathtakingly beautiful Ashley Judd as his devoted wife Linda were inspired casting choices. The two talented actors glowed with that all too rare dynamic known as on-screen chemistry. Most of us have heard it said at one time or another that ""the rich are different"". Maybe so. What I witnessed in just shy of two hours was a chemistry shared between two highly gifted actors that breathed a convincing life and an easy believability into an unconventional marital relationship. What Cole Porter gave America is a rich and timeless musical portfolio that will live on and on long after we pass from the scene. One can only guess if this legacy would have possible had Cole Porter not been so emotionally conflicted yet so deeply in love with the woman in his life till death did they part. This film featured some of the finest makeup work ever witnessed, transforming a young Cole Porter into an aging shadow of his former glory. Some of his finest songs were richly showcased featuring several contemporary vocalists, the period costuming was wonderful and the direction by Irwin Winkler was steady and crisp. The Porter's love story is the stuff of show business legend and for the obvious loving care and dedicated technical craft that worked its collective magic to translate their storied lives onto the silver screen I am truly grateful.",4,"Genius, pure genius",1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,2157,"['utterly', 'facinating', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'brought', 'sharp', 'focus', 'lavish', 'life', 'one', 'America', 'finest', 'songwriters', 'De-Lovely', 'technically', 'musical', 'suppose', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'necessarily', 'so', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'too', 'not', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'suppose', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'riches', 'riches', 'life', 'was', 'punctuated', 'heady', 'cornucopia', 'sexual', 'experience', 'arguably', 'bi-sexual', 'kind', 'personal', 'background', 'likely', 'well-spring', 'complex', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'vocalize', 'lyrics', 'found', 'close', 'captioning', 'really', 'come', 'own', 'while', 'viewing', 'work', 'reading', 'lyrics', 'being', 'sung', 'developed', 'new', 'found', 'appreciation', 'choice', 'words', 'phrasing', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'up', 'words', 'oh', 'content', 'Starring', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Porter', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'devoted', 'wife', 'Linda', 'were', 'inspired', 'casting', 'choices', 'two', 'talented', 'actors', 'glowed', 'too', 'rare', 'dynamic', 'known', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Most', 'have', 'heard', 'said', 'one', 'time', 'rich', 'are', 'different', 'Maybe', 'so', 'What', 'witnessed', 'just', 'shy', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'chemistry', 'shared', 'two', 'highly', 'gifted', 'actors', 'breathed', 'convincing', 'life', 'easy', 'believability', 'unconventional', 'marital', 'relationship', 'What', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'gave', 'America', 'rich', 'timeless', 'musical', 'portfolio', 'will', 'live', 'long', 'pass', 'scene', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'legacy', 'would', 'have', 'possible', 'had', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'emotionally', 'conflicted', 'yet', 'so', 'deeply', 'love', 'woman', 'life', 'death', 'did', 'part', 'film', 'featured', 'finest', 'makeup', 'work', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'transforming', 'young', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'aging', 'shadow', 'former', 'glory', 'finest', 'songs', 'were', 'richly', 'showcased', 'featuring', 'several', 'contemporary', 'vocalists', 'period', 'costuming', 'was', 'wonderful', 'direction', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', 'was', 'steady', 'crisp', 'Porter', 'love', 'story', 'stuff', 'show', 'business', 'legend', 'obvious', 'loving', 'care', 'dedicated', 'technical', 'craft', 'worked', 'collective', 'magic', 'translate', 'storied', 'lives', 'silver', 'screen', 'am', 'truly', 'grateful']",N/A
862265,A3GB6RKLASF9HB,B00067BBLY,"R. Kearns-White ""rockiw""","[2, 7]","De-Lovely has all of the makings of a great movie. It has a wonderful and engaging cast, especially Kevin Kline as the American composer and songwriter Cole Porter. Ashley Judd is ethereal as the long-suffering wife of Cole Porter, Linda Lee Porter. Cole Porter?s music?performed mostly by today?s musical contemporaries like Robbie Williams and Sheryl Crow?is still beautiful, catchy and witty. The period suits and dresses are aesthetically pleasing. With all those pluses, De-Lovely should have been an excellent and entertaining movie but it isn?t. It left with me with an empty and confused feeling.Cole Porter (1891-1964) married Linda Lee Porter (1883-1954) in 1919.  Linda was a wealthy divorc&eacute;e, and several years older than Porter was when they wed. Porter was gay. Linda and Cole shared a mainly platonic marriage, which included separate bedrooms in their lush houses. The biopic De-Lovely inspires to be a celebration of their relationship, a love affair that is higher (and perhaps purer) than sex and sexual orientation. However, it doesn?t succeed.The movie never truly explains why Linda accepted this type of arrangement even though she knew from the start that Cole would rather sleep with men. Did she do it because she was lonely? Did she do it because they were great friends? Or did she do it because she needed a cover for her own sexual orientation? One never knows. In De-Lovely, Linda Lee knowingly marries a gay man yet balks (a lot!) when Cole has trysts with men. She encourages him to move to different parts of the world to work on his music in hopes that it will distract him from his extramarital affairs, and then becomes upset when it doesn?t. She even leaves him, only to come back when he is injured in a horseback riding accident.  It only appears in this movie that Linda stayed with Cole to be able to apply for martyrdom.One is motivated to watch the movie from beginning to end to see if the secrets of their relationship are ever revealed. They are not, and, in the end it, makes De-Lovely a very dissatisfying movie despite its wonderful characteristics.As earlier mentioned, Kevin Kline?s performance is sublime. The music, although performed with a certain amount of campiness, remains timeless.

I'm not certain the real Cole would have felt more positive toward ""De-Lovely.""Unlike ""Night and Day,"" ""De-Lovely"" tries to be more honest in dealing with Cole's homosexuality and the problems Cole and his wife Linda must face as a result. I say the film tries to be more honest but doesn't succeed.  It's ironic that one of the movie's stars, Jonathan Pryce, himself starred in ""Carrington,"" a movie that accomplished in this regard what ""De-Lovely"" fails to do.The best word to describe Cole's gay liaisons in ""De-Lovely"" would be coy. Both director Irwin Winkler and star Kevin Kline seem to be lacking any gay sensibilities whatsoever, which one might consider a necessity in dealing with any kind of honest depiction of Cole Porter, who was very much a gay man of his time.  Or was Winkler simply fearful of not offending any homophobes in the audience (who would not be going to see this movie anyway)?  Where there exists strong cinematic chemistry between Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd, as Cole's wife Linda, there is absolutely zero chemistry between Kevin Kline and any of his male lovers. Here's a typical example. One cleverly written scene involves Cole's tutoring of an actor, John Barrowman, to sing ""Night and Day"" properly. Cole explains that it is a song about obsession and proceeds to sing the song along with the actor.  Later on, Barrowman meets kline for a gay tryst in Central Park.  This ""Night and Day"" duet should have been rife with sexual tension between Cole and the actor, so that the later Central Park scene could be viewed as the pay-off.  Instead, there is no sexual tension whatsover, either from Kevin Kline or from the actor. Kline's scenes with a Russian dancer are also devoid of any glimmer of lust or passion.  A viewer is left with the peculiar sensation that as a homosexual, Cole is a dud and is simply going through the motions and that perhaps he is a latent heterosexual after all. (Having said this and thinking back, I realize now that the gay sexual tension in ""In and Out"" is coming from Tom Selleck and never from Kevin Kline.)Neither director Winkler or star Kline needed to be more graphic in any way regarding this (to secure the PG rating).  (There is nothing graphic, for example, in the movie ""Carrington,"" which does accomplish this theme of a gay writer's relationship with a woman, alongside his attraction for other men.)Other problems with the film also seem to involve audience appeasement in some way. The choice to use modern orchestrations and today's vocalists, with their modern vocal styles mainly intact, was jarring and less than satisfying, except for Natalie Cole (who sings ""Ev'ry Time You Say Goodbye"") and Vivian Green (who sings ""Love for Sale""), both of whom were wonderful. Why are the moviemakers assuming that a modern audience cannot appreciate styles of music from sixty or seventy years ago?Some other choices were questionable.  The use of Cole's songs were mainly inserted to highlight dramatic situations that might fit the lyrics, rather than when the songs were actually written.  The fantasy framework of using Jonathan Pryce as the angel Gabriel to set up the story of Cole's life with Linda was also a peculiar choice, which led to a finale of ""Blow, Gabriel, Blow"" (beautifully performed by Pryce, I might add) but which was obviously ripped off from Bob Fosse's ""All That Jazz.""  Far more jarring was the ""Be a Clown"" number, involving Kline, Peter Polycarpou as Louis B. Mayer, and entourage.  Since the other musical numbers are all in some type of realistic context, such fantasy inclusions seemed a bit out of place.Finally, Cole Porter was a social animal, whose friendships with noted personalities of the period -- Noel Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Fred Astaire, Tallulah Bankhead, George Gershwin, Clifton Webb, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, etc. -- would have made for some swell parties indeed.  In ""De-Lovely,"" only a few notable people appear -- such as Monty Wooley as a cruising buddy, Irving Berlin as a mentor, and Gerald Murphy and family as close friends. Mainly, a viewer has the feeling that Cole's life for the most part was centered around Linda alone, his muse, and that this is their love story to the exclusion of all else.Granted, there are enormous difficulties in creating a movie biography of Cole and his wife, and the attempt on Mr. Winkler's part is certainly admirable. Even if the end result is less than successful, the movie is worth seeing for several reasons -- to hear Cole's music in whatever form, and to watch Ashley Judd's nuanced performance, even though she is far better than her material.",2,How honest is it?,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,4825,"['scene', 'De-Lovely', 'Cole', 'Linda', 'finish', 'watching', 'first', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'biopic', 'Night',

862270,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00067BBLY,Robert Morris,"[41, 46]","What we have here is a film based on but not limited to the adult life of Cole Porter. How to describe it? It's not a biopic nor is it a musical comedy. It resembles All That Jazz (1979) and Evita (1996) when combining fact with contrivance within a series of flashbacks to create dramatic impact. Various devices (e.g. hallucination and reminiscence) enable us to explore various components of Porter's life as well as the various relationships which he developed over a period of several decades. Kevin Kline brilliantly portrays Porter, with an able supporting cast headed by Ashley Judd (Linda Thomas Cole), Jonathan Pryce (Gabe), Kevin McNally (Gerald Murphy), Sandra Nelson (Sara Murphy), and Alan Corduner (Monty Woolley). I guess this could be called a Film Noir/Musical Review. Defining moments in Porter's adult life are coordinated with his greatest Broadway musicals which include Gay Divorcee, Anything Goes, and Kiss Me Kate, later adapted to the screen. As for his most popular songs, several of their titles suggest double meanings when we take into account Porter's bi-sexual love life. For example, ""Let's Do It,"" ""I've Got You Under My Skin,"" ""You Do Something to Me,"" and ""Anything Goes."" Irwin Winkler pulls all of this together fairly well. Yes, the plot has its lumpy moments and, yes, the make-up isn't always effective (late in life, Kline's Porter resembles Charles Foster Kane) but the musical performances are highly entertaining and I especially appreciate the fact that Kline sings as ineptly as Porter did. I much prefer this version to Night and Day (1946) which Porter enjoyed because he was played by Cary Grant.

Sensual without every becoming overly sexual; sad without ever becoming depressing; and musical throughout.Kevin Kline clearly has to hold back his true singing voice to match Cole more...and that is one of the shames of this film -- casting one of the last couple decades most robust musical theatre performers and asking him to subdue his performance.Ashley Judd turns in a nuanced and complete performance, in a part that is poorly sketched out and has no backstory.

862274,A61WRN3Y04WU8,B00067BBLY,"Ryan L. ""Ryan Lattanzio""","[5, 6]","Delightful, delicious, whatever, Irwin Winkler's De-Lovely is frankly problematic, but still one of the freshest, most enjoyable experiences of the movie summer so far. Think of one of the underrated American actors, Kevin Kline, a beautiful actress at the top of her game (Ashley Judd), and throw in some of today's current musical stars (Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crowe, Diana Krall, etc.-scenes which feel a little out of place). You get one of Irwin Winkler's best, although the filmmaker is really not a great talent. Even though I did like the imperfect and deeply flawed Life as a House, this one I prefer more-even though they are completely different.It is not the best musical of the century because I love Moulin Rouge!, but I think that I like it more than Chicago, just a little bit, in that it has something to say. It is an often profound biography and a dazzling musical at other times.De-Lovely is the story of Cole Porter, the famous American songwriter of musicals which eventually became films. Set in the 1920s, his life is depicted through random musical sequences as he meets his soon-to-be-wife Linda and very quickly sweeps her off of her feet. Their marriage is troubled because of Porter's bisexual tendencies and attraction to me (""He has an enormous appetite for life.""), which is justified by him saying that he cannot find love in solely the opposite gender. It is never clear why Linda stays by his side for most of his life, but it is apparent by the end that they both really did love each other.This ""musical"" is brilliantly stylized, with some of the best cinematography this year. Shots wrap around characters, the color palette changes, and there are even black and white images. De-Lovely has the amazing (and lovely!) ability to appear very theatrical and stagy on the screen. It is a very classy film, and is also great, brassy fun. Critics have commented on how the love story feels underdeveloped, but my thoughts are that it is supposed to be that way. Their marriage was airless at times, and Cole often displayed little or no marriage in his wife. The film focused more on the marriage than the romance leading up to it, which I would like to have seen a little bit more of.There are only a few musical sequences that are not being witnessed through one of Porter's musically charged theater productions, and they seem a little bit out of place. They do not illuminate from the material with smoothness and ease, but they are still a joy to watch. There were two instances of dialogue that did not feel true to the characters, but they will be overlooked. The performances are fascinating, and Ashley Judd displays more talent than she ever has before. Kevin Kline is astonishing as Cole Porter, even though I do not predict Oscar nominations for either...at this point. The musical guests are fantastic, as usual, and Alanis Morissette is the best of the bunch in my opinion. Also, on a side note, the artistry and visual aspect of the film is stunning, and I hope for many Oscar nominations in the costume, art direction, makeup, and cinematography categories.I enjoyed this film endlessly despite minor problems, and would gladly see it again. It is a highly sophisticated, delightful (and de-lovely), and pleasing film. Yes it feels empty and stagy, but that is how musicals are supposed to be! Characters are often underdeveloped, and the music is completely random, but seriously entertaining. Overall, it is a movie musical that is, justly, a tribute to the musical.",4,"Delightful, delicious, De-Lovely is still a bit di-sappointi",1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,3519,"['Delightful', 'delicious', 'whatever', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', 'De-Lovely', 'frankly', 'problematic', 'still', 'one', 'freshest', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'experiences', 'movie', 'summer', 'so', 'far', 'Think', 'one', 'underrated', 'American', 'actors', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'top', 'game', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'throw', 'today', 'current', 'musical', 'stars', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'Sheryl', 'Crowe', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'etc.-scenes', 'feel', 'little', 'place', 'get', 'one', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', 'best', 'filmmaker', 'really', 'not', 'great', 'talent', 'Even', 'did', 'imperfect', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'Life', 'House', 'one', 'prefer', 'more-even', 'are', 'completely', 'different.It', 'not', 'best', 'musical', 'century', 'love', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'think', 'like', 'more', 'Chicago', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'say', 'often', 'profound', 'biography', 'dazzling', 'musical', 'other', 'times.De-Lovely', 'story', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'famous', 'American', 'songwriter', 'musicals', 'eventually', 'became', 'films', 'Set', '1920s', 'life', 'depicted', 'random', 'musical', 'sequences', 'soon-to-be-wife', 'Linda', 'very', 'quickly', 'sweeps', 'off', 'feet', 'marriage', 'troubled', 'Porter', 'bisexual', 'tendencies', 'attraction', 'enormous', 'appetite', 'life', 'justified', 'saying', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'love', 'solely', 'opposite', 'gender', 'never', 'clear', 'why', 'Linda', 'side', 'most', 'life', 'apparent', 'end', 'really', 'did', 'love', 'other.This', 'musical', 'brilliantly', 'stylized', 'best', 'cinematography', 'year', 'Shots', 'wrap', 'characters', 'color', 'palette', 'changes', 'are', 'even', 'black', 'white', 'images', 'De-Lovely', 'amazing', 'lovely', 'ability', 'appear', 'very', 'theatrical', 'stagy', 'screen', 'very', 'classy', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'brassy', 'fun', 'Critics', 'have', 'commented', 'how', 'love', 'story', 'feels', 'underdeveloped', 'thoughts', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'way', 'marriage', 'was', 'airless', 'times', 'Cole', 'often', 'displayed', 'little', 'marriage', 'wife', 'film', 'focused', 'more', 'marriage', 'romance', 'leading', 'up', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'of.There', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'musical', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'witnessed', 'one', 'Porter', 'musically', 'charged', 'theater', 'productions', 'seem', 'little', 'bit', 'place', 'do', 'not', 'illuminate', 'material', 'smoothness', 'ease', 'are', 'still', 'joy', 'watch', 'were', 'two', 'instances', 'dialogue', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'true', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'overlooked', 'performances', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'more', 'talent', 'ever', 'before', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'astonishing', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'predict', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'point', 'musical', 'guests', 'are', 'fantastic', 'usual', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'best', 'bunch', 'opinion', 'Also', 'side', 'note', 'artistry', 'visual', 'aspect', 'film', 'stunning', 'hope', 'many', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'costume', 'art', 'direction', 'makeup', 'cinematography', 'categories.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'endlessly', 'minor', 'problems', 'would', 'gladly', 'see', 'again', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'delightful', 'de-lovely', 'pleasing', 'film', 'Yes', 'empty', 'stagy', 'how', 'musicals', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'Characters', 'are', 'often', 'underdeveloped', 'music', 'completely', 'random', 'seriously', 'entertaining', 'Overall', 'movie', 'musical', 'justly', 'tribute', 'musical']",N/A
862275,A6FIAB28IS79,B00067BBLY,Samuel Chell,"[1, 2]","At one point Jay Cocks' script borders on the self-congratulatory when Cole and Linda are shown viewing the earlier biopic starring Cary Grant with obvious displeasure.  This remake, of course, is going to tell it like it is, and indeed the script of ""De-Lovely"" strains to account for the (frequently) flawed face of artistic genius.  Linda tells Cole that his music stems from his talent, not his behavior, whereas Cole tries to explain that it's all part of the same inseparable package:  without the excesses, the disloyalties, the self-indulgences he wouldn't be who he is--arguably America's greatest songwriter.  In the end, ""De-Lovely"" is self-descriptive: not a pretty picture--more Asbury Park than Granada, to paraphrase a Porter lyric.Perhaps today's audiences need more proof that he really was a great songwriter.  Or given the moral correctness of our times, perhaps audiences are incapable of empathizing with those given to self-indulgences. Or they may think they know all too well ""the wages of sin.""  Or perhaps the acting of Kline and Judd overwhelms the script's good intentions.  Indeed, they come across as two people who, as each is fully aware, ask too much of one another.  He gives her gifts, love, sporadic devotion; she gives him gifts, his vanity (i.e., useless legs), and undying devotion.  In the end, and in the still of the night, Linda's devotion cuts through the darkness--a flickering memory but all that Cole has left before the screen goes black.We believe the characters, their relationship, and their deep if unconventional love--perhaps too much.  The film becomes a frequently luminous and tuneful soap opera about a main character who is more pathetic than tragic, about a self-destructive songwriter who self-destructs for obvious reasons, but in a deliberate, slow, very sad and depressing manner.  Orson Welles had in essence a similar character and plot framework in ""Citizen Kane,"" but he also had the directing ""style"" (which above all should be foremost in anything related to Cole Porter's music and life) and a ""motivator"" to make Kane's willful and self-ignorant destruction a mutually shared obsession, inviting us at every moment to become adventurer-detectives searching for the clues that will lead us to ""Rosebud.""By contrast, ""De-Lovely"" wallows in pain and misery for the last 30 minutes, insulting us with a momentary deus ex machina (""Blow, Gabriel, Blow""--the clumsy choreography and camera work are exceeded only by the execrable, cheesy musical arrangement), and then attempting to rescue everything with that flickering, potentially powerful, image that is the film's final moment.  Too little, too late--and too soon, moreover, after we've endured the spectacle of our subject reduced to a pay-for-play ""John,"" a victim of blackmail (triply so, because Linda is included, as is their relationship and mutual trust).  The soundtrack plays ""Love for Sale,"" but what we witness is a love that's far more than ""slightly soiled.""The project needed to be rethought.  Most of today's viewers are totally unsympathetic with the private lives of artists (one would think the writers would pay attention to politics) and, for that matter, unfamiliar with Porter's songs.  The film would have done a great service had it opened viewers' hearts and minds to the ""obsessions"" (an apt term used in the film) of others, the personal mind-images and different objects of desire that motivate the passions of the artist in ways that move us all.  (What's the gain in portraying Monty Wooley as a pimp?)  Or it would have done an equal service had it launched a whole new wave of interest in the music of Cole Porter.Sadly, it fails there, too, for reasons too numerous to mention.  As a musician, I have no answers for the film's complete re-harmonization if not rewriting of ""Begin the Beguine.""  (If such flagrant disregard of the man's music is acceptable, why should we accept the film's representation of Porter's life?)  Perhaps it's just as well the film bypasses Porter ""essentials"" like ""I've Got You Under My Skin,"" ""I Get a Kick Out of You,"" and ""At Long Last Love.""  And, of course, only Hollywood can be counted on to make a musical about American jazz musicians' favorite American composer with nary a measure of music that swings!  In short, musically this production is clueless about the heart of great American popular music.  The performances and arrangements in ""De-Lovely"" owe more to the late Victorian-era sounds of the British music hall than to the African-American musical forms that directly inspired Berlin, Gershwin, Arlen, even Kern and, indirectly at least, Cole Porter.This is a movie/DVD that few people will care too watch more than once.  If you count yourself in that number, and if you're wondering why someone would bother to make a movie about Cole Porter, pick up any recording by Sinatra and Nelson Riddle with ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" (""Songs for Swinging Lovers"" is a good start) or ""Night and Day.""  If you tire of either song (virtually impossible), try the inspired, absolutely scintillating version of ""In the Still of the Night"" on the first disc of the recent ""Sinatra-Vegas"" box.  And if that's not enough, there's plenty more from the same source, or from Ella Fitzgerald on the ""Cole Porter Songbook."" Or listen to Mabel Mercer explaining how it (in Porter songs, love is frequently an ""it"" or ""thing"") was ""Just One of Those Things,"" or to Dinah Washington actually selling it on ""Love for Sale,"" or to Danny Kaye performing the pyrotechnical verbosity of ""Let's Not Talk About Love,"" or to any singer who imparts to these timeless, immortal songs and lyrics the life that is theirs, allowing them to become the magnificent obsessions of yet another generation of listeners.[Why the 4-star rating?  Maybe I got the movie entirely wrong, and if I didn't, maybe the movie succeeded in creating sympathy for and interest in Cole Porter as well as the original, indigenous art form at which Cole excelled: the ""American Popular Song,"" along with ""The Great American Songbook,"" which owes so much of its brilliance to the contributions of his inarguable genius.  Musical composition--in verbal, cinematic, or musical language--is not a thumbs up, thumbs down proposition.  I'm frankly bummed by dismissals of Robert Altman's ""Nashville"" (my favorite movie), but I'll respect the opinion of any reviewer who took the time to screen the film and give it some serious thought.]",4,"Great acting, good intentions, wasted opportunities",1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,6478,"['one', 'point', 'Jay', 'Cocks', 'script', 'borders', 'self-congratulatory', 'when', 'Cole',

862276,A1T4IVIH6NUEXF,B00067BBLY,sand-da-man,"[8, 15]","I've been avoiding writing a review of this film because I thought it just wasn't worth the time. Seeing the comments by others, though, I finally feel compelled to do so. In a sentence, what were they trying to do here? We were told from the trailers and the pre-release reviews that the movie (originally dubbed 'Just One of Those Things') would reveal the bi-sexual aspect of Cole Porter's private life. Ok- in today's society, that's acceptable, but making it the focal point for scenes, indeed the compass for our journey, obscured the character of this movie and ultimately its purpose. Was it supposed to be a musical or a fanatasy or a drama or what?To begin, having  Porter (Kevin Klein) looking backward from the end of his life could have been beneficial, but instead proved to be a needless and distracting device: presumably providing dreamlike, ethereal quality as he revisits the (supposed)benchmark events in his musical career, it added nothing to the film except confusion. Was it fantasy?The segues (if we can call them that) between scenes and/or points in Porter's life usually defied any sense of context as well. The viewer is pulled from one time sequence and location to another, almost without reference (the off-stage Porter actually could have assisted here but his comments are parenthetical, not explanatory)- was it drama?As expected, of course, there was plenty of playing and singing of Porter's compositions- but just because they were included doesn't mean they received a quality treatment.  Much can be said pro and con about having contemporary stars interpreting 'tween the wars classics, but the approach was a real detriment here. A number of the performers, especially Lara Fabian, Diane Krall, Robin Williams, and Natalie Cole, have proved their worth doing period pieces before (not so for Alanis Morisette and Sheryl Crowe- ugh!), but even the good efforts were wasted in this. They were sometimes used as an irrelevant introduction to a scene, but more often as thinly disguised, cheap levers to have the presence of a pop headliner grab (or keep) the viewer's attention. The effect was imbalance, which became even more disturbing when the songs and performances were relegated to the background. An exception was the finale that went to the other extreme, making such bombast that it was more reminiscent of a George M. Cohan review than a homage to the music of a gifted song writer - was it a musical?Overall, the real pity is that ""De-Lovely"" devotes little attention to the nature of the composer's genius. The story either minimizes or distorts that issue, if it explores it at all. Rather, we are constantly reminded of Porter's male and female affairs, as if that would suffice. To add insult to injury, the pace of the film moved like a funeral dirge.  Where there should have been excitement, there was boredom.  Where there should have been exhilaration, there was resignation. Criticism can certainly be aimed at the original ""Night and Day"" version, with Cary Grant in the lead role, for not being historically(sexually)accurate or being too melodramatic, but it sure beat the heck out of this. ""De-Lovely"" is simply a mess! Despite valiant contributions from Klein and Ashley Judd, who played Porter's wife, not much is worthy of praise. If the object was to do a better, more authentic job of capturing the essence of Cole Porter and his music, it failed miserably. Then again, it's not clear what its point was. The direction, editing and script were simply horrid. - Believe me, you won't miss a thing if you pass on this one.",1,What were they trying to do?,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,3590,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'avoiding', 'writing', 'review', 'film', 'thought', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'Seeing', 'comments', 'others', 'finally', 'feel', 'compelled', 'do', 'so', 'sentence', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'here', 'were', 'told', 'trailers', 'pre-release', 'reviews', 'movie', 'originally', 'dubbed', ""'Just"", 'One', 'Things', 'would', 'reveal', 'bi-sexual', 'aspect', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'private', 'life', 'Ok-', 'today', 'society', 'acceptable', 'making', 'focal', 'point', 'scenes', 'indeed', 'compass', 'journey', 'obscured', 'character', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'purpose', 'Was', 'supposed', 'be', 'musical', 'fanatasy', 'drama', 'what', 'begin', 'having', 'Porter', 'Kevin', 'Klein', 'looking', 'backward', 'end', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'beneficial', 'instead', 'proved', 'be', 'needless', 'distracting', 'device', 'presumably', 'providing', 'dreamlike', 'ethereal', 'quality', 'supposed', 'benchmark', 'events', 'musical', 'career', 'added', 'nothing', 'film', 'confusion', 'Was', 'fantasy', 'segues', 'can', 'call', 'scenes', 'and/or', 'points', 'Porter', 'life', 'usually', 'defied', 'sense', 'context', 'well', 'viewer', 'pulled', 'one', 'time', 'sequence', 'location', 'almost', 'reference', 'off-stage', 'Porter', 'actually', 'could', 'have', 'assisted', 'here', 'comments', 'are', 'parenthetical', 'not', 'explanatory', 'was', 'drama', 'expected', 'course', 'was', 'plenty', 'playing', 'singing', 'Porter', 'compositions-', 'just', 'were', 'included', ""n't"", 'mean', 'received', 'quality', 'treatment', 'Much', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'pro', 'con', 'having', 'contemporary', 'stars', 'interpreting', 'wars', 'classics', 'approach', 'was', 'real', 'detriment', 'here', 'number', 'performers', 'especially', 'Lara', 'Fabian', 'Diane', 'Krall', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Natalie', 'Cole', 'have', 'proved', 'worth', 'doing', 'period', 'pieces', 'not', 'so', 'Alanis', 'Morisette', 'Sheryl', 'Crowe-', 'even', 'good', 'efforts', 'were', 'wasted', 'were', 'sometimes', 'used', 'irrelevant', 'introduction', 'scene', 'more', 'often', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'cheap', 'levers', 'have', 'presence', 'pop', 'headliner', 'grab', 'keep', 'viewer', 'attention', 'effect', 'was', 'imbalance', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'when', 'songs', 'performances', 'were', 'relegated', 'background', 'exception', 'was', 'finale', 'went', 'other', 'extreme', 'making', 'such', 'bombast', 'was', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'George', 'M.', 'Cohan', 'review', 'homage', 'music', 'gifted', 'song', 'writer', 'was', 'musical', 'Overall', 'real', 'pity', 'De-Lovely', 'little', 'attention', 'nature', 'composer', 'genius', 'story', 'minimizes', 'distorts', 'issue', 'Rather', 'are', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'Porter', 'male', 'female', 'affairs', 'would', 'suffice', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'pace', 'film', 'moved', 'funeral', 'dirge', 'Where', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'excitement', 'was', 'boredom', 'Where', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'exhilaration', 'was', 'resignation', 'Criticism', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'aimed', 'original', 'Night', 'Day', 'version', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'lead', 'role', 'not', 'being', 'historically', 'sexually', 'accurate', 'being', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'sure', 'beat', 'heck', 'De-Lovely', 'simply', 'mess', 'valiant', 'contributions', 'Klein', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'who', 'played', 'Porter', 'wife', 'not', 'much', 'worthy', 'praise', 'object', 'was', 'do', 'better', 'more', 'authentic', 'job', 'capturing', 'essence', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'music', 'failed', 'miserably', 'Then', 'again', 'not', 'clear', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'direction', 'editing', 'script', 'were', 'simply', 'horrid', 'Believe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'thing', 'pass', 'one']",N/A

However, I am always wary of Hollywood's interpretation of historical events so I am not sure how much I learned.  I found it particularly annoying that the filmmakers sympathetically portray Cole as a man torn between his love for his wife and his lust for men.  My view is that he was a self-indulgent ass who wanted to have his wife and play around with boys too.

862280,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00067BBLY,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 5]","Irwin Winkler's ""De-Lovely"" spins a entertaining yarn in the form of a bio-pic about perhaps America's most Puckish musical prodigy, Cole Porter.  Played with a quiet dignity (a surprising choice, given the rambunctious tendencies of the real-life figure) by Master Kline, Porter remains a bit of an enigma throughout the entire film . . . but an enigma who can crank out the tunes.The not-so-tiny sub-genre of the musical bio-pic is dominated by Milos Forman's ""Amadeus.""  ""De-Lovely"" is not in the class of that masterwork, perhaps because nobody in the movie brings any degree of malice to it even remotely on par with F. Murray Abraham's craven spider, Salieri.Kline also does not rise to the level of Abraham's performance as narrator, either.  Where ""Amadeus"" has a straightforward narration by the older Salieri, ""De-Lovely"" chooses a different narration structure . . . the aged, wrinkled, dying Porter watches a dramatic reproduction of his life with a director/producer/angel/devil Gabriel (Jonathan Pryce).  The motivation for this appears to be either a demonstration of Porter's dissatisfaction with his own life, or with theatrical interpretations of his works -- at one point, the dying Porter grumps, ""This is all wrong,"" as a scene plays out before him.The movie also presumes that the audience is already very familiar with Cole Porter and the music scene of the times.  Whiel there is a brief conflict about whether Porter should move to the youthful Hollywood from the aging New York Broadway scene, we really don't see any positioning of Porter within the musical pantheon -- his greatness is often commented on, but never really explained. (Again, ""Amadeus"" exceeds ""De-Lovely"" here, both when Salieri tells of Mozart's famous youthful mastery of music as well as the struggle between the composers for the Emperor's favor.)(Okay, okay, I know it's silly to keep comparing this movie to one other specific film, but I had high expectations for this movie and wanted to love it as much as I love ""Amadeus"" . . . and the cast and crew also appear to have a strong devotion to this material . . . so it's a bit tough when the movie doesn't quite live up to expectations.)The movie spends a great deal of time exploring, in delicate fashion, Cole Porter's homosexuality and his complex relationship with his adoring wife, Linda (played as a worldly realist by Ashley Judd in a solid, moving performance).  While we may never know how much Linda actually knew about her husband's ""other interests,"" ""De-Lovely"" manages to play out its theories in believable terms, and Linda's seemingly incompatible tolerance and adoration of her husband doesn't seem too far-fetched.Perhaps most believably, ""De-Lovely"" does not make Porter into man hopelessly in love with Linda yet sexually drawn to other men.  Porter seems to regard her with reverence, awe, and appreciation, but Porter seems most at love with himself.  This is a good choice, as Porter definitely treats Linda most shabbily.  The movie handles this with discretion . . . an example comes when Linda arrives at the Porter's Hollywood mansion, walks into the back yard, and sees Cole happily surrounded by several of his ""other interests,"" blissfully unaware of Linda's arrival.  Had he seen her, Cole undeniably would have treated her with his trademark charm and consideration, but she understands that Cole is never going to make much of an effort to seek her out.  All in all, Cole Porter comes across as the stereotypical spoiled genius, and this rings true.The music, of course, is top-notch -- it's Cole Porter, after all.  Quibble about the choices of the various modern stars singing Porter's tunes on the soundtrack, but they are still singing some of the best tunes ever jangled.All in all, ""De-Lovely"" is a movie that I wanted to love more than I actually fell in love with, and perhaps that's an appropriate reaction to Mr. Porter, too.  An enjoyable film that can round out the film library, but not a ""must-have.""  More of a ""should-see.""",4,Kevin Kline and Cast Make Delightful Music Delightful!,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,4025,"['Irwin', 'Winkler', 'De-Lovely', 'entertaining', 'yarn', 'form', 'bio-pic', 'perhaps', 'America', 'most', 'Puckish', 'musical', 'prodigy', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Played', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'surprising', 'choice', 'given', 'rambunctious', 'tendencies', 'real-life', 'figure', 'Master', 'Kline', 'Porter', 'bit', 'enigma', 'entire', 'film', 'enigma', 'who', 'can', 'crank', 'out', 'tunes.The', 'not-so-tiny', 'sub-genre', 'musical', 'bio-pic', 'dominated', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'Amadeus', 'De-Lovely', 'not', 'class', 'masterwork', 'perhaps', 'nobody', 'movie', 'degree', 'malice', 'even', 'remotely', 'par', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'craven', 'spider', 'Salieri.Kline', 'also', 'not', 'rise', 'level', 'Abraham', 'performance', 'narrator', 'either', 'Where', 'Amadeus', 'straightforward', 'narration', 'older', 'Salieri', 'De-Lovely', 'different', 'narration', 'structure', 'aged', 'wrinkled', 'dying', 'Porter', 'dramatic', 'reproduction', 'life', 'director/producer/angel/devil', 'Gabriel', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'motivation', 'be', 'either', 'demonstration', 'Porter', 'dissatisfaction', 'own', 'life', 'theatrical', 'interpretations', 'works', 'one', 'point', 'dying', 'Porter', 'grumps', 'wrong', 'scene', 'out', 'him.The', 'movie', 'also', 'audience', 'already', 'very', 'familiar', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'music', 'scene', 'times', 'Whiel', 'brief', 'conflict', 'Porter', 'should', 'move', 'youthful', 'Hollywood', 'aging', 'New', 'York', 'Broadway', 'scene', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'positioning', 'Porter', 'musical', 'pantheon', 'greatness', 'often', 'commented', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'Again', 'Amadeus', 'De-Lovely', 'here', 'when', 'Salieri', 'Mozart', 'famous', 'youthful', 'mastery', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'struggle', 'composers', 'Emperor', 'favor', 'Okay', 'okay', 'know', 'silly', 'keep', 'comparing', 'movie', 'one', 'other', 'specific', 'film', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'wanted', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Amadeus', 'cast', 'crew', 'also', 'appear', 'have', 'strong', 'devotion', 'material', 'bit', 'tough', 'when', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'exploring', 'delicate', 'fashion', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'homosexuality', 'complex', 'relationship', 'adoring', 'wife', 'Linda', 'played', 'worldly', 'realist', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'solid', 'moving', 'performance', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'Linda', 'actually', 'knew', 'husband', 'other', 'interests', 'De-Lovely', 'play', 'out', 'theories', 'believable', 'terms', 'Linda', 'seemingly', 'incompatible', 'tolerance', 'adoration', 'husband', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'far-fetched.Perhaps', 'most', 'believably', 'De-Lovely', 'not', 'make', 'Porter', 'man', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'Linda', 'yet', 'sexually', 'drawn', 'other', 'men', 'Porter', 'regard', 'reverence', 'awe', 'appreciation', 'Porter', 'most', 'love', 'good', 'choice', 'Porter', 'definitely', 'Linda', 'most', 'shabbily', 'movie', 'discretion', 'example', 'when', 'Linda', 'Porter', 'Hollywood', 'mansion', 'walks', 'back', 'yard', 'sees', 'Cole', 'happily', 'surrounded', 'several', 'other', 'interests', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'Linda', 'arrival', 'Had', 'seen', 'Cole', 'undeniably', 'would', 'have', 'treated', 'trademark', 'charm', 'consideration', 'Cole', 'never', 'going', 'make', 'much', 'effort', 'seek', 'out', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'stereotypical', 'spoiled', 'genius', 'true.The', 'music', 'course', 'top-notch', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Quibble', 'choices', 'various', 'modern', 'stars', 'singing', 'Porter', 'tunes', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'still', 'singing', 'best', 'tunes', 'ever', 'jangled.All', 'De-Lovely', 'movie', 'wanted', 'love', 'more', 'actually', 'fell', 'love', 'perhaps', 'appropriate', 'reaction', 'Mr.', 'Porter', 'too', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'can', 'round', 'out', 'film', 'library', 'not', 'must-have', 'More', 'should-see']",N/A

The approach to the story is interesting if haphazard and much like a stage based show though Pryce is a little jarring and miscast.Miscasting by far seems to be the let down of this work. The leads are fabulous but Allen as Irving Berlin is just glaringly wrong as is Wilby as Linda's 1st husband. The singers are appointed with equal brilliance and glaring clumsiness, Robbie Williams, Dana Krall and Natalie Cole are jst perfect, as is the girl (I could not decipher her name) who plays Ethel Merman singing ""Anything Goes"". Even if Merman's style drove you up the wall you have to admire this near perfect representation. But then there is Alannis Morrisette, Sheryl Crow and Mick Hucknall; just beyond wrong! I like these artists but this film is not for them.There are some let downs in the whistle stop plot line too, Linda and Cole have a 1930's wedding and yet actually married in 1919 as a for instance.

Cole Porter was a great songwriter, so the film is naturally loaded with great songs, but sometimes the film-makers' desire to get so very many performers into the act caused huge stylistic shifts.  Some portions of the film were very campy and/or self-conscious, while others were detailed, realistic, and highly emotional.  The overall effect was something like a scrapbook in which Polaroid prints, church bulletins, fading color photos, and excellent art photos are all squeezed onto the pages.  I felt that somebody - the editor? Who? lost control of this movie, or that arguments were settled by letting everyone have his way for part of the film!Since Cole Porter wrote such stylish, superb songs, it seems to me his life story could have been served with more continuity and class.As for people that don't know about gay musicians who have wives, and even more or less love their wives after a fashion, well, try working as a musician for a quarter-century or so, as I did.  You'll see it over and over again.  Maybe nowadays these guys feel less pressure to marry a woman - I don't know.So why did I give it four stars?  It's the music, stupid!  This great music is just - GREAT.  Some of the performances were stunning.  So it is enjoyable, and Kevin Kline did a wonderful job...you mean he really isn't Cole Porter?

Whether this was actually so is of course questionable; but in any case, ""De-Lovely"" did not seem to me as if it was pretending to be a perfect biography but is mostly a homage to the variety and value of human feelings, the feelings Porter was so incredibly good at catching with his tunes.It is admirable how many different and always believable emotions Porter's songs know how to express; also, he was an enthusiastic lyricist, his opinion was that music and lyrics ought to be ""as married"". ""Let's do it"", ""Begin the Beguine"", ""What is this Thing Called Love"" or ""Night and Day"" are classical songs which probably everybody knows, even if they are no experts with this kind of music.The crew of famous and all very talented singers appearing in this film is legendary and an enormous asset, the CD became one of my all-time-favourites since I bought it right after having first watched the film. I don't see what it wrong with the way e.g. Alanis Morissette sings ""Beguin the Beguine"" (the melancholy arrangement is to me exactly what the song needs) or with Elvis Costello singing ""Let's Misbehave"" with typical verve and humour.The only minor point is the ending: it seems as if the director could not quite decide which scene was supposed to be the end scene, so that as a viewer you get irritated believing again and again that the film is ending only to see it continue once more; I found this somehow dissatisfying and unnecessary.

Of course, it isn't new for Hollywood to get it wrong--but the people involved in this film should know better-especially Kline.While some moments are indeed culled from reality (Cole Porter did lose the use of both his legs in a riding accident later in life and did have to be carried into the opening night of his musical KISS ME KATE on Broadway), some of the ""liberties"" Irwin Winkler and the screenwriter take with the facts are rather astonishing.Like another reviewer has mentioned, Cole Porter led a fantastic, fun-filled social life, surrounded by wonderful personalities like Elsa Maxwell (where was she in the film?), Monty Wooley (represented, but poorly), the African-American entertainer Bricktop, Noel Coward, and the Windsors.  Of course his parties would have been something else!  But if you went by this film, you'd think he had few friends and nobody to count on but his wife Linda.Ashley Judd is completely miscast as the wealthy divorcee who connects with Porter.  She has no chemistry with Kline or anyone else in the film, and is too young for the part.Kline himself is too old to play the young Porter and the ridiculously bad make-up used to make him the ""old Porter"" makes this viewer wish they had cast 2 actors.Kline certainly has the right energy and vivacity to play a convincing Porter, but he needs a good script and a clever director and talented co-stars..all of which he was lacking in this sad excuse for a biopic.Don't even get me started on the simply murderous versions of some of Porter's most wonderful songs, massacred by the modernized orchestrations and deliveries of the likes of Sheryl Crow (!!! Her take on ""Begin the Beguine"" is the worst cover of a Porter song I've ever heard--it doesn't even sound like the same song!), Elvis Costello, and other minor artists that don't deserve the few seconds given to them on screen.Such a wasted opportunity to make a wonderful story for the screen about one of our greatest composers.  Sad on all accounts.If you want a better view of Porter's life and his music, I recommend the musical RED, HOT & COLE, a wonderful show that was written in the late 70s and was produced in LA and Richmond (never got to Broadway), but that uses Porters songs and the setting of several of his ""swell parties"", to tell his life story much more interestingly than this film could ever hope to do.",1,It's DE-PRESSING...,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,2414,"['sad', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'get', 'so', 'wrong', 'course', ""n't"", 'new', 'Hollywood', 'get', 'wrong', 'people', 'involved', 'film', 'should', 'know', 'better-especially', 'Kline.While', 'moments', 'are', 'indeed', 'culled', 'reality', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'did', 'lose', 'use', 'legs', 'riding', 'accident', 'later', 'life', 'did', 'have', 'be', 'carried', 'opening', 'night', 'musical', 'KISS', 'ME', 'KATE', 'Broadway', 'liberties', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', 'screenwriter', 'take', 'facts', 'are', 'rather', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'led', 'fantastic', 'fun-filled', 'social', 'life', 'surrounded', 'wonderful', 'personalities', 'Elsa', 'Maxwell', 'where', 'was', 'film', 'Monty', 'Wooley', 'represented', 'poorly', 'African-American', 'entertainer', 'Bricktop', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'Windsors', 'course', 'parties', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'else', 'went', 'film', ""'d"", 'think', 'had', 'few', 'friends', 'nobody', 'count', 'wife', 'Linda.Ashley', 'Judd', 'completely', 'miscast', 'wealthy', 'divorcee', 'who', 'Porter', 'chemistry', 'Kline', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'too', 'young', 'part.Kline', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'young', 'Porter', 'ridiculously', 'bad', 'make-up', 'used', 'make', 'old', 'Porter', 'viewer', 'wish', 'had', 'cast', '2', 'actors.Kline', 'certainly', 'right', 'energy', 'vivacity', 'play', 'convincing', 'Porter', 'good', 'script', 'clever', 'director', 'talented', 'co-stars..all', 'was', 'lacking', 'sad', 'excuse', 'biopic.Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'simply', 'murderous', 'versions', 'Porter', 'most', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'massacred', 'modernized', 'orchestrations', 'deliveries', 'likes', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'take', 'Begin', 'Beguine', 'worst', 'cover', 'Porter', 'song', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', ""n't"", 'even', 'sound', 'same', 'song', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'other', 'minor', 'artists', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'few', 'seconds', 'given', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'make', 'wonderful', 'story', 'screen', 'one', 'greatest', 'composers', 'Sad', 'accounts.If', 'want', 'better', 'view', 'Porter', 'life', 'music', 'recommend', 'musical', 'RED', 'HOT', 'COLE', 'wonderful', 'show', 'was', 'written', 'late', '70s', 'was', 'produced', 'LA', 'Richmond', 'never', 'got', 'Broadway', 'Porters', 'songs', 'setting', 'several', 'swell', 'parties', 'tell', 'life', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'interestingly', 'film', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'do']",N/A
862289,A27KWLGCORT0US,B00067BBLY,Steamboater,"[3, 5]","Most critics panned it; I loved this film. Yes, Cole Porter's life as shown is a series of snapshots interspersed with many of the song hits he wrote. That shouldn't bother anyone, especially if you've seen that old white-washed version with Cary Grant and Alexis Smith. In one scene Porter (Kevin Kline), and Linda Lee (Ashley Judd)--his wife--sit in a movie theater watching that film. Smith looked ridiculous running over to Porter. It was too melodramatic and just doesn't hold up anymore; in fact, it was quite funny.The film begins with Porter, very old, ill and weary, sitting alone at a piano. A man--like the ghost of Christmas Past--walks in and takes him back through snapshot scenes of Porter's life. And what a life! (My only criticism is about the time Porter lived abroad/in Paris. The 20/30's were such a wild and exciting time for the rich. They felt they could do anything and usually did. There was a good attempt at showing us this e.g., a tamed 'wild' costume party but you really never got a sense of how fun and decadent it really was.When I heard that Alanis Morissette and Sheryl Crow were cast to sing in the film, I thought,'what are they doing there?! Associating Porter's work with the past was something I couldn't get away from. I expected crooners and female replicas of various 40's band singers. However, when I saw the film, I was astonished at how well a contemporary spin on the past works. Morissette and Crow were perfect casting choices. I suppose however that's why songs become standards; they can easily be sung by anyone during any one generation and sound wonderful.The relationship between Lee and Porter was a marriage of convenience that few people could really understand. I've known people like this and they love each other as passionately as the best of lovers, even if they seldom do in a physical way. A very good friendship can be a powerful anchor.Later in the film, Lee becomes ill and these are Judd's best scenes. She may not have pulled off the wealthy sophisticate, but she definitely comes across when the going gets tough. (Judd could be cast in a remake of Fitzgerald's 'Tender Is The Night'. The original version with Jennifer Jones was good but Jones was too old for the part.)Kline is exceptionally good. He portrays Porter as sophisticated, intelligent, so talented that he could come up with melodies and lyrics on the spot, jaded as heard in his song, 'Love For Sale', angry, sad, trivial and child-like and brutally honest about himself.(One word about a certain production number. A lead singer performs exactly like Ethel Merman. She looks like her, sings like her and even moves like her. Just wonderful! I don't know her name.)At the end of the film, all of Porter's past friends and lovers and his wife Linda Lee, step off stage and greet Porter as he sits in the audience beaming with delight at their presence. They're his life story come to life for the last time.In the end though, get out your hankies because you will use them. I was very upset. Maybe if I were 20 or 30 I wouldn't have felt that way but the end of this film makes an older person think about his mortality and what everything in his life meant. Here, you have a man who had everything yet in the end was alone, at his insistance. Regardless, it makes you think if anything has value, even relationships, for in the end wealth, the good times and all the past fun and craziness mean nothing; it was terrifying. What was it all for? For Porter at least, it was for a legacy of songs that will be remembered and sung for generatins to come.

The film focuses too much on his closeted struggles and romances with women, but to reduce Porter to this treatment is silly and salacious.

I realize that being an artist involves a lot of time spent in isolation, perfecting one's artwork, but still, I would have preferred to see more of Porter's struggles as an artist (although he came from a wealthy Episcopalian family in Indiana, and was considered to be a millionaire dilettante by many songwriters on Broadway and Tin Pan Alley). I also would have liked to see more insight into his creative process instead of this ""greatest hits"" paean that, unfortunately, seems intent on killing off any younger viewer's budding interest in the man and his work.

It seems to want to be both modern and an old-fashioned ""just the lines, please"" biography of the type that is actually derided in this movie, the earlier fictionalized Porter biography starring Cary Grant.  There are a couple of mysteries the audience is left with, mainly because so many of the characters seem to be fictionalized: such as the blond ballet dancer whom we see is Porter's male lover while courting and marrying Linda.  (No explicit sex or nudity in this film; merely some non-passionate kissing both male-female and male-male.)  And also John Barrowman's ""Jack,"" who is probably another imaginary or composite character.  However, Barrowman is actually one of the bright spots of the film.  The scene where Kline as Porter coaches him (an established musical star in real life) in how to sing NIGHT AND DAY is a classic, especially since it is also the only scene where Kline is able to sing as Kline (he's sung Gilbert and Sullivan on Broadway (THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE) and therefore had to tone down his own vocal prowess to play non-singer Porter, who has many numbers in the film).  And though the rest of the staging of the musical numbers, with the exception of ANYTHING GOES, is anything but old-fashioned, Barrowman's singing of NIGHT AND DAY could have been lifted from a time capsule, the manner and staging stiff and unbelievable, but true to the time.  The casting of Judd as Linda is interesting; she physically inhabits the role and is a wonderful actress, even though criticism is she is younger than Kline whereas the real Linda was older than Porter.  Only if you know this fact, however, would the casting of Judd as Linda bother you.  In fact, while watching the film, since Judd has such a physical similarity to Kline's real-life wife, who is probably older than Judd, it made me wonder why Phoebe Cates wasn't cast as Linda.  Then, there might have been real chemistry between the two leads, which is lacking in the Judd-Kline pairing.  They are two pros working together, but nothing special here.  Regarding the musical numbers, some are excellent on their own, worthy music videos, but much of the time is spent by the audience playing spot-the-singer, which takes one out of the film for distressingly long periods of time, smacking the viewer in the face with reality when they need to be immersed in the story unfolding on-screen, not in how so-and-so looks in that dress and hairstyle or Gee, you mean they can actually SING?

As he says in this film, Kevin Kline 'can survive anything.'  Even this clithed biopic.At least, as a biopic, 'De-Lovely' is more honest than the  preceeding one 'Night and Day' made in 1946.  The new one, describing the frivolous entertainers' world with meticulously created costumes (by G. Armani), doesn't hesitate to touch the sexual matters more explicitly, and Porter's unique relations with Linda Porter (Ashley Judd) are surely shown.And Kevin Kline again proves that he is such a gifted actor, easily exuding the charms of Porter himself in a convincing manner.  Though I don't know whether his playing Porter all through his life (from young to aged) is a good idea, Kline tackles it with special make-ups, and the results are fairly good (though the same cannot be said about Ashley Judd, who looks buried in unnatural prosthetics).But Irwin Winkler's heavy-handed directions are awfully damaging while the predestrian script does not add up to much.  When you see Jonathan Pryce, who 'directs' the stage (in some dark and dingy theater) on which the fictional life of Porter is played, and Kevin Kline's glum and grim Porter watches it, we know this contrivance is unnecessary.  And the film fails to make us understand why Linda is so attracted to Cole.  If you do, that's because you are watching Kevin Kline, not Porter, as such a charming fellow.The brightest spots are its songs.  I don't write down all the titles performed, but the musicians who gathered for this film  are all great.  They include Elvis Costello, Natalie Cole, Sheryl Crow, Mario Frangoulis, Lara Fabian, Vivian Green, Alanis Morissette, Mick Hucknall, Robbie Williams, Lemar, and Diana Krall.You don't find special things about Porter himself in 'De-Lovely.'

I never met any of them, but there is no way they were witless nothings.  That's what everyone in this movie is...a nothing.  Clearly, they didn't want to offend anyone by showing what Cole and Monty's sexual escapades were really like, or what kind of personality would dream up the naughtiness of a lyric like ""I've got you under my skin"" and ""you're the top.""The Hollywood section was mystifying.  What movie with a mountie and an indian princess are they representing?  Was that supposed to be ""Rose Marie""?  Wasn't ""Rosalie"" the film where Porter wrote a horrible title song that Louis B. Mayer actually liked?Didn't Fred Astaire introduce ""Night and Day"" in the stage production ""The Gay Divorce"", and not Cole's lover? (who the hell is ""Jack""?)  The movie doesn't even mention the title of the show, or give any idea when any of this is taking place.In other words, this is a biopic designed for people who have heard some Porter songs but know nothing about him.  No, it doesn't need to be a 100% accurate catalog of his life, but come ON...show the audience a little respect and try to at least get the historical details straight--give your movie some kind of credibility.They even pulled in a bunch of contemporary artists (Robbie Williams, Diana Krall), and for the most part don't let them complete entire numbers.  What is going on with that arrangement of ""Begin the Beguine"" by Sheryl Crow?  Would't it have been better to have these stars sing these songs as they were arranged, and not re-interpret them?And the bookending segments with Jonathan Pryce...good Lord.  What is this--A Christmas Carol?  Maybe they were trying for a little ""All That Jazz""-type plotting.  Good luck with that.  That movie had guts and wasn't afraid to be ugly...this movie is absolute decorous nonsense.I wouldn't be so hard on this movie if it hadn't tried to pass itself off as somehow correcting the mistake of the movie ""Night and Day""...this movie is JUST as flawed.One redeeming quality: everyone I saw the movie with went out looking for Cole Porter songs to download off the internet.

Luckily, director Irwin Winkler managed to collect the cream of the modern singing crop and sprinkle them over this trifle of a bio-pic, all singing the best of Porter's collection.  Unfortunately, that is the film's strongest quality (along with some redeemably creative editing).  The music endears, and you find yourself snapping along to its resonance in your memory as the credits begin to roll and you begin to walk right out of that theater.

862304,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00067BBLY,William Hare,"[6, 7]","""De-Lovely"" uses some of the greatest love songs ever written to serve as the connecting link to the biography of the man who wrote them, Cole Porter.  The approach of director Irwin Winkler works as we see intelligent segues from Porter, composing in whatever setting, to ultimate execution on stage.  A host of current popular stars such as Sheryl Crow, Natalie Cole and Alanis Morissette, to name but a few, are called on to provide the numbers with their ultimate flourish after Porter has laid the necessary groundwork.Kevin Kline portrays the songwriter, who came from a small Indiana town but was a scion to great wealth.  In Paris he meets and falls in love with Ashley Judd, who is described as ""the most beautiful divorcee"" in that dashing city of light.  She is actually a shade short of divorce when she meets the fun loving songwriter, and one tense and brief scene develops involving the new lovebirds and the alcoholic, wife-beating husband she is shedding.A major element of concern for Judd as wife to a man with constant champagne wishes and caviar dreams and a pocketbook to match is that he focus enough energy to fully develop his talents.  Kline comments that the lavish villa they occupy in romantic Venice was once occupied by Robert Browning, who did far more writing there but had a lot less fun than the songwriter.  At one point Irving Berlin pays court, telling Porter how impressed he is with his talent.Coaxing by Mrs. Porter and a favorable tribute from Berlin prompts Broadway to beckon the songwriter's call.  He disciplines himself satisfactorily to go there and take New York by storm with his music.The subject of Porter's bisexuality is handled tastefully.  Judd never attempts to change him, but chastises him when he fails to be discrete.  Visits to a gay nightclub result in both Judd and Kline being blackmailed by one enterprising opportunist with a design on starting a theatrical agency.  The Porters become the blackmailer's designated financial angels.Porter explains to Judd and anyone close to him who wants to know that he is truly the sum of his various disparate parts.  While Judd can give him a certain type of love, he requires another type of affection from homosexual encounters.  If he sometimes seems to stray too far from work in pursuit of fun, he emphatically states that he needs to be in the correct mood to successfully create.At one point Judd is prepared to leave Kline, but when he is injured falling from a horse and has to have his legs amputated she remains with him and serves as his pillar of strength.  The gesture is fully returned.  When Judd, an inveterate smoker, becomes terminally ill from lung cancer he is there to be her needed Rock of Gibraltar.The music alone is enough to make viewing the film worthwhile, but there is so much more, excellent choreography and depth of characterization within the framework of superb music.  In addition to the song that comprises the film's title, ""De-Lovely"", others greats from the Porter bountiful repertoire are also included, such enduring classics as ""Night and Day"", which was the title of the dramatic film version of Porter's life starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith, as well as ""In the Still of the Night"" and ""You'd be so Easy to Love"" while at the film's conclusion a rousing rendition of ""Blow Gabriel Blow"" is appropriately presented.Jonathan Pryce, billed as Gabe and appropriately the angel Gabriel, puts Porter through his paces from a different dimension.  The songwriter has an opportunity to see his fascinating life pass in review, one beset by travel, adventure, luxury and, above all, love and song.",5,Music as Biography,1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,3643,"['De-Lovely', 'greatest', 'love', 'songs', 'ever', 'written', 'serve', 'connecting', 'link', 'biography', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'approach', 'director', 'Irwin', 'Winkler', 'see', 'intelligent', 'segues', 'Porter', 'composing', 'setting', 'ultimate', 'execution', 'stage', 'host', 'current', 'popular', 'stars', 'such', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Natalie', 'Cole', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'name', 'few', 'are', 'called', 'provide', 'numbers', 'ultimate', 'flourish', 'Porter', 'laid', 'necessary', 'groundwork.Kevin', 'Kline', 'songwriter', 'who', 'came', 'small', 'Indiana', 'town', 'was', 'scion', 'great', 'wealth', 'Paris', 'love', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'who', 'described', 'most', 'beautiful', 'divorcee', 'dashing', 'city', 'light', 'actually', 'shade', 'short', 'divorce', 'when', 'fun', 'loving', 'songwriter', 'one', 'tense', 'brief', 'scene', 'involving', 'new', 'lovebirds', 'alcoholic', 'wife-beating', 'husband', 'shedding.A', 'major', 'element', 'concern', 'Judd', 'wife', 'man', 'constant', 'champagne', 'wishes', 'caviar', 'dreams', 'pocketbook', 'match', 'focus', 'enough', 'energy', 'fully', 'develop', 'talents', 'Kline', 'comments', 'lavish', 'villa', 'occupy', 'romantic', 'Venice', 'was', 'once', 'occupied', 'Robert', 'Browning', 'who', 'did', 'far', 'more', 'writing', 'there', 'had', 'lot', 'less', 'fun', 'songwriter', 'one', 'point', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'court', 'telling', 'Porter', 'how', 'impressed', 'talent.Coaxing', 'Mrs.', 'Porter', 'favorable', 'tribute', 'Berlin', 'prompts', 'Broadway', 'beckon', 'songwriter', 'call', 'satisfactorily', 'go', 'there', 'take', 'New', 'York', 'storm', 'music.The', 'subject', 'Porter', 'bisexuality', 'handled', 'tastefully', 'Judd', 'never', 'change', 'when', 'be', 'discrete', 'Visits', 'gay', 'nightclub', 'result', 'Judd', 'Kline', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'one', 'enterprising', 'opportunist', 'design', 'starting', 'theatrical', 'agency', 'Porters', 'become', 'blackmailer', 'designated', 'financial', 'angels.Porter', 'Judd', 'anyone', 'close', 'who', 'know', 'truly', 'sum', 'various', 'disparate', 'parts', 'Judd', 'can', 'give', 'certain', 'type', 'love', 'type', 'affection', 'homosexual', 'encounters', 'sometimes', 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'work', 'pursuit', 'fun', 'emphatically', 'be', 'correct', 'mood', 'successfully', 'create.At', 'one', 'point', 'Judd', 'prepared', 'leave', 'Kline', 'when', 'injured', 'falling', 'horse', 'have', 'legs', 'amputated', 'serves', 'pillar', 'strength', 'gesture', 'fully', 'returned', 'When', 'Judd', 'inveterate', 'smoker', 'terminally', 'ill', 'lung', 'cancer', 'there', 'be', 'needed', 'Rock', 'Gibraltar.The', 'music', 'alone', 'enough', 'make', 'viewing', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'excellent', 'choreography', 'depth', 'characterization', 'framework', 'superb', 'music', 'addition', 'song', 'film', 'title', 'De-Lovely', 'others', 'greats', 'Porter', 'bountiful', 'repertoire', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'such', 'enduring', 'classics', 'Night', 'Day', 'was', 'title', 'dramatic', 'film', 'version', 'Porter', 'life', 'starring', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Alexis', 'Smith', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'Night', ""'d"", 'be', 'so', 'Easy', 'Love', 'film', 'conclusion', 'rousing', 'rendition', 'Blow', 'Gabriel', 'Blow', 'appropriately', 'presented.Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'billed', 'Gabe', 'appropriately', 'angel', 'Gabriel', 'Porter', 'paces', 'different', 'dimension', 'songwriter', 'opportunity', 'see', 'fascinating', 'life', 'pass', 'review', 'one', 'beset', 'travel', 'adventure', 'luxury', 'love', 'song']",N/A

For some reason, this film didn't click with me emotionally. I guess I am not familiar with Cole Porter. I am too young to know him. So I basically went to see this film for the couriosity of seeing the all-star cameros, especially Sheryl Crow. The life of Porter was provocative because he was bisexual,and it kind of ruinned his career and relationships. Nothing about the story touched me, except for Ashley Judd's breakthrough performance as an unconditional loving wife. She has never been so good, considered her character aged from 30-60 years old, and died from illness. The moment when she was getting made over in her room by herself, and she suddenly broke down into massive tears, because she realized that she had never been loved whole-heartedly by her husband. That was the scene to remember! I hope she will at least get nominated for an Oscar, because she made me forget about all of her action thrillers in this movie. Kevin Klein was very good, and it's not the first time he played a flaming homo. In and Out was the last time he gone ""pink"". He's character was too selfish and sexually permiscuious for me to like. I preferred him in Life as A House a lot more. If you don't know Cole Porter or don't listen to his music, than you will find it somewhat boring to sit through this film.",3,Ashley Judd's best  work!,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,1387,"['normanlly', 'love', 'biopics', 'Frida', 'Chaplin', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'reason', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'emotionally', 'guess', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'am', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'So', 'basically', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'couriosity', 'seeing', 'all-star', 'cameros', 'especially', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'life', 'Porter', 'was', 'provocative', 'was', 'bisexual', 'kind', 'ruinned', 'career', 'relationships', 'Nothing', 'story', 'touched', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'unconditional', 'loving', 'wife', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'good', 'considered', 'character', 'aged', '30-60', 'years', 'old', 'died', 'illness', 'moment', 'when', 'was', 'getting', 'made', 'room', 'herself', 'suddenly', 'broke', 'down', 'massive', 'tears', 'realized', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'loved', 'whole-heartedly', 'husband', 'was', 'scene', 'remember', 'hope', 'will', 'least', 'get', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'made', 'forget', 'action', 'thrillers', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Klein', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'played', 'flaming', 'homo', 'Out', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'gone', 'pink', 'character', 'was', 'too', 'selfish', 'sexually', 'permiscuious', 'like', 'preferred', 'Life', 'A', 'House', 'lot', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'music', 'will', 'find', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'sit', 'film']",N/A
862306,A2UVJD6OOLKEBR,B00067BBLY,yaremar,"[5, 7]","Call me old-fashioned, but I think there's something wrong with a movie that spends more time dealing with the sexual preference of a great composer than it does with his music. And I think it's terribly misleading to hype said film as an old-style Hollywood musical.DE-LOVELY, which covers the life and career of Cole Porter, is definitely a film worth seeing. It takes great care in presenting the curious and loving marriage between Porter (well-played by Kevin Kline) and his wife Linda (Ashley Judd, in another impressive performance), who, despite her husband's homosexuality, remained a devoted spouse. The fact that DE-LOVELY openly deals with his sexuality doesn't bother me in the slightest. What does bother me is that the magnificent Porter song catalogue is frittered away. Contemporary pop singers Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, and Natalie Cole turn up to warble such Porter standards as ""Let's Do It,"" ""It Was Just One of Those Things,"" ""Begin the Beguine,"" ""Anything Goes,"" and ""Let's Misbehave,"" yet nearly all these renditions are whittled down to fragments. Very few of the songs are presented intact. What's the point of having Robbie Williams sing ""It's De-Lovely""-the title song, no less!-if you're not going to allow the audience to hear the entire thing? Why document Porter's sexual escapades in detail then give short shrift to his true legacy? And why should anyone who's already paid to see the movie have to purchase the soundtrack in order to hear the whole score? (Strangely, two of the numbers presented in their complete form are, in my opinion, two of Porter's lesser efforts: ""Be a Clown"" and ""Well, Did You Evah?"")Striving for truth and accuracy in a Hollywood movie biography is an ultimately pointless undertaking. THE JOLSON STORY (1946) was a hugely entertaining biopic. Would it have been more entertaining if Al Jolson had been portrayed as the ruthless egomaniac he reportedly was in real life, rather than the kindhearted soul depicted in the film? I think not. If we're searching for accuracy, why not get Steve Buscemi to play Cole Porter, since he looks more like Porter than Kevin Kline does. Another fact: Linda was several years older than Cole, hardly the fresh-faced young character played by Ashley Judd. As a result, the true dynamics of their real-life relationship is never fully delved into.In NIGHT AND DAY (1946), an earlier Cole Porter biopic, Cary Grant played the composer in a sanitized version of his life story. The watered-down screenplay may not have been accurate, but the studio (Warner Brothers) wasn't concerned about it; they just let those wonderful Cole Porter songs play out in all their glory. At least they got that part right.Still, I'm awarding DE-LOVELY three stars, primarily on the strength of the lead performances. The pity is that, with the proper presentation of the music, it could have been a five-star effort.",3,Bring back the sound of music so tender,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2929,"['Call', 'old-fashioned', 'think', 'something', 'wrong', 'movie', 'more', 'time', 'dealing', 'sexual', 'preference', 'great', 'composer', 'music', 'think', 'terribly', 'misleading', 'hype', 'said', 'film', 'old-style', 'Hollywood', 'musical.DE-LOVELY', 'life', 'career', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'definitely', 'film', 'seeing', 'great', 'care', 'presenting', 'curious', 'loving', 'marriage', 'Porter', 'well-played', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'impressive', 'performance', 'who', 'husband', 'homosexuality', 'remained', 'devoted', 'spouse', 'fact', 'DE-LOVELY', 'openly', 'deals', 'sexuality', ""n't"", 'bother', 'slightest', 'What', 'bother', 'magnificent', 'Porter', 'song', 'catalogue', 'frittered', 'away', 'Contemporary', 'pop', 'singers', 'Alanis', 'Morissette', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Diana', 'Krall', 'Natalie', 'Cole', 'turn', 'up', 'warble', 'such', 'Porter', 'standards', 'Let', 'Do', 'Was', 'Just', 'One', 'Things', 'Begin', 'Beguine', 'Anything', 'Goes', 'Let', 'Misbehave', 'yet', 'nearly', 'renditions', 'are', 'whittled', 'down', 'fragments', 'Very', 'few', 'songs', 'are', 'presented', 'intact', 'What', 'point', 'having', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'sing', 'De-Lovely', '-the', 'title', 'song', 'less', '-if', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'allow', 'audience', 'hear', 'entire', 'thing', 'Why', 'document', 'Porter', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'detail', 'then', 'give', 'short', 'shrift', 'true', 'legacy', 'why', 'should', 'anyone', 'who', 'already', 'paid', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'purchase', 'soundtrack', 'order', 'hear', 'whole', 'score', 'Strangely', 'two', 'numbers', 'presented', 'complete', 'form', 'are', 'opinion', 'two', 'Porter', 'lesser', 'efforts', 'Be', 'Clown', 'Well', 'Did', 'Evah', 'Striving', 'truth', 'accuracy', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'biography', 'ultimately', 'pointless', 'undertaking', 'THE', 'JOLSON', 'STORY', '1946', 'was', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'biopic', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'had', 'been', 'portrayed', 'ruthless', 'egomaniac', 'reportedly', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'rather', 'kindhearted', 'soul', 'depicted', 'film', 'think', 'not', ""'re"", 'searching', 'accuracy', 'why', 'not', 'get', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'play', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'more', 'Porter', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'fact', 'Linda', 'was', 'several', 'years', 'older', 'Cole', 'hardly', 'fresh-faced', 'young', 'character', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'result', 'true', 'dynamics', 'real-life', 'relationship', 'never', 'fully', 'delved', 'into.In', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'DAY', '1946', 'earlier', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'biopic', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'played', 'composer', 'sanitized', 'version', 'life', 'story', 'watered-down', 'screenplay', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'accurate', 'studio', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'was', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'just', 'let', 'wonderful', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'songs', 'play', 'out', 'glory', 'least', 'got', 'part', 'right.Still', ""'m"", 'awarding', 'DE-LOVELY', 'three', 'stars', 'primarily', 'strength', 'lead', 'performances', 'pity', 'proper', 'presentation', 'music', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'five-star', 'effort']",N/A
