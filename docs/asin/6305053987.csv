After seeing it, I'll certainly keep the tapes around. The picture is grainy as if it had been taped from a station with poor reception.As for the DVD contents, I wouldn't call this 'the best'. I have watched every episode from the wonder years, and while I admit it has one of the best finales from the history of TV (in my opinion, obviously), there were other episodes that deserved to make the best.Also, the DVD only has 71 minutes. They could at least fill it up. The pilot would have been nice to have, maybe a few minutes with the scenes of the now famous guest stars, or a small 'where are they now' of the cast...something that makes a difference with a home made collection.In short: If you have the episodes on tapes, don't buy this DVD. If you are going to buy a new DVD player and want to check its picture quality, don't buy this DVD. Of course if you like good TV and don't care much about anything else, well, the wonder years was a great show.",2,Worst DVD quality I've ever seen,1007856000,"12 9, 2001",2001,1050,"['got', 'DVD', 'hope', 'could', 'replace', 'one', 'two', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'collection', 'seeing', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'keep', 'tapes', 'picture', 'grainy', 'had', 'been', 'taped', 'station', 'poor', 'reception.As', 'DVD', 'contents', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', ""'the"", 'best', 'have', 'watched', 'episode', 'wonder', 'years', 'admit', 'one', 'best', 'finales', 'history', 'TV', 'opinion', 'obviously', 'were', 'other', 'episodes', 'deserved', 'make', 'best.Also', 'DVD', 'only', '71', 'minutes', 'could', 'least', 'fill', 'up', 'pilot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'maybe', 'few', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'now', 'famous', 'guest', 'stars', 'small', 'are', 'now', 'cast', 'something', 'difference', 'home', 'made', 'collection.In', 'short', 'have', 'episodes', 'tapes', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'are', 'going', 'buy', 'new', 'DVD', 'player', 'want', 'check', 'picture', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'course', 'like', 'good', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'well', 'wonder', 'years', 'was', 'great', 'show']",Wonder Years: The Best of

Wonder years was a great show I always watched it on Network Tv then on Tv land and Tnn and Nick at night.  I know Season 1 is in the works somewhere in the future so If I were you I would wait for that.  All these other no name shows are on dvd there are some great tv shows on dvd but alot more crappy ones then good.  We all ask where is the Wonder years come on FOXr who now owns  rights to Wonder Years needs to put Wonder Years  on dvd come on Fox you put more shows then anyone on dvd why not this one.  I was on a site and there is a petition to sign for what shows you would like to see come to dvd and Wonder Years has got over 3500 votes the site is tvshowsondvd.com if you want to sign it you can also sign up on Amazons so the more people who sign these up the better chance we have of seeing Wonder Years finally come to dvd.  Here is an excerpt from Fox "" This issue of Entertainment Weekly quotes Fox Home Entertainment's Senior Vice President of Marketing & Communications, Mr. Steve Feldstein, as saying ""We've got it on the schedule, but there are hurdles to clear prior to a firm release date.""""On the schedule"" sounds pretty good to us, how about you? In all likelihood, the ""hurdles"" would start with all the music licensing that would have to occur in order to present the show on DVD the same way it was originally broadcast. According to the EW story, that is precisely the way the people who were behind the production of The Wonder Years wants to see these episodes brought home. Us too, and we're sure we speak for most of you as well. It will be worth waiting a little bit longer (and even paying a little bit more, like with Freaks and Geeks) to get this the way it *should* be seen.Fox, do us proud!""",1,Do not Buy This Wait For Season 1,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1796,"['advise', 'one', 'buy', 'dvd', 'only', '1', 'lonely', 'episode', 'Wonder', 'years', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'always', 'watched', 'Network', 'Tv', 'then', 'Tv', 'land', 'Tnn', 'Nick', 'night', 'know', 'Season', '1', 'works', 'somewhere', 'future', 'were', 'would', 'wait', 'other', 'name', 'shows', 'are', 'dvd', 'are', 'great', 'tv', 'shows', 'dvd', 'alot', 'more', 'crappy', 'ones', 'then', 'good', 'ask', 'where', 'Wonder', 'years', 'come', 'FOXr', 'who', 'now', 'rights', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'put', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'dvd', 'come', 'Fox', 'put', 'more', 'shows', 'then', 'anyone', 'dvd', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'was', 'site', 'petition', 'sign', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'come', 'dvd', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'got', '3500', 'site', 'tvshowsondvd.com', 'want', 'sign', 'can', 'also', 'sign', 'up', 'Amazons', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'sign', 'better', 'chance', 'have', 'seeing', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'finally', 'come', 'dvd', 'Here', 'excerpt', 'Fox', 'issue', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'Fox', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'Senior', 'Vice', 'President', 'Marketing', 'Communications', 'Mr.', 'Steve', 'Feldstein', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'got', 'schedule', 'are', 'hurdles', 'clear', 'prior', 'firm', 'release', 'date', 'schedule', 'pretty', 'good', 'how', 'likelihood', 'hurdles', 'would', 'start', 'music', 'licensing', 'would', 'have', 'occur', 'order', 'present', 'show', 'DVD', 'same', 'way', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'According', 'EW', 'story', 'precisely', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'production', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'see', 'episodes', 'brought', 'home', 'Us', 'too', ""'re"", 'sure', 'speak', 'most', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'waiting', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'even', 'paying', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'get', 'way', 'be', 'seen.Fox', 'do', 'proud']",Wonder Years: The Best of
445592,A285Y6MRU4GH9,6305053987,Joecool,"[50, 53]","I'm a huge fan of the Wonder Years, and have most of them on tape recorded from Nik at night.  Some are very depressing, but still great to watch.  This DVD contains a clip show and the series finale.  The finale is a great double episode, but horrible quality and awful changes ruin it.  To my astonishment the theme from 'The Natural' has been cut out of the final scene.  A similar generic flute solo replaces it.  This completely takes away from emotion and importance of the ending.  Also, when Kevin drives to meet Winnie at the country club, CCR's 'Up Around the Bend' is replaced by some generic sound-alike song.  Did they lose the rights to these songs or something?  Plus the sound needs to be turned way up to hear the dialog, thus static is heard throughout.  It's even hard to recognize 'With a Little Help From My Friends' during the intro because of extreme mono.  To tell you how bad the picture is, during Kevin and Winnie's first kiss, the color flashes between twilight and nighttime.  And during a scene in the school hallway, everyone turns kind of blue for a split second.  I hope no one sees the finale for the first time in this version, because you wouldn't even think it's that good.  The reviewer from Canada must have a black and white TV with one speaker not to recognize this horrible quality.  It's like someone took the original version, put it through a trash compactor, eliminated the best songs, and then put it on a DVD to fully expose its distortion.  I recommend watching recorded VHS versions (even extended play) because they sound better, look better, and haven't been tampered with.",1,....I feel I got ripped off.,977270400,"12 20, 2000",2000,1625,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'have', 'most', 'tape', 'recorded', 'Nik', 'night', 'are', 'very', 'depressing', 'still', 'great', 'watch', 'DVD', 'clip', 'show', 'series', 'finale', 'finale', 'great', 'double', 'episode', 'horrible', 'quality', 'awful', 'changes', 'ruin', 'astonishment', 'theme', ""'The"", 'Natural', 'been', 'cut', 'final', 'scene', 'similar', 'generic', 'flute', 'solo', 'completely', 'away', 'emotion', 'importance', 'ending', 'Also', 'when', 'Kevin', 'meet', 'Winnie', 'country', 'club', 'CCR', 'Bend', 'replaced', 'generic', 'sound-alike', 'song', 'Did', 'lose', 'rights', 'songs', 'something', 'sound', 'be', 'turned', 'way', 'hear', 'dialog', 'thus', 'static', 'heard', 'even', 'hard', 'recognize', ""'With"", 'Little', 'Help', 'My', 'Friends', 'intro', 'extreme', 'mono', 'tell', 'how', 'bad', 'picture', 'Kevin', 'Winnie', 'first', 'kiss', 'color', 'flashes', 'twilight', 'nighttime', 'scene', 'school', 'hallway', 'everyone', 'kind', 'blue', 'split', 'second', 'hope', 'one', 'finale', 'first', 'time', 'version', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'good', 'reviewer', 'Canada', 'must', 'have', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'one', 'speaker', 'not', 'recognize', 'horrible', 'quality', 'someone', 'took', 'original', 'version', 'put', 'trash', 'compactor', 'eliminated', 'best', 'songs', 'then', 'put', 'DVD', 'fully', 'expose', 'distortion', 'recommend', 'watching', 'recorded', 'VHS', 'versions', 'even', 'extended', 'play', 'sound', 'better', 'look', 'better', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'tampered']",Wonder Years: The Best of
