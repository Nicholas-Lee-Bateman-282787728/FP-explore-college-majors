1333805,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0039A9MFW,trebe,"[0, 0]","This two disc set released in 2010 contains three Charles Bronson films.  The Mechanic (1972) is on one disc, while Assassination (1987), and Messenger Of Death (1988) are combined on the second disc.  They are all presented in widescreen, there are no extra features, and none of the films is subtitled.  Image quality is pretty good, and this set would be a solid value buy for Bronson fans who do not own these films.  Some have reported problems with The Mechanic DVD, if the film's runtime isn't around 100 minutes, contact the manufacturer for a replacement disc.The Mechanic: (Rating: 4 stars)Bronson plays Arthur Bishop, a contract killer also known as a ""mechanic"".  The film does a nice job of showing how Bishop prepares and completes his assignments.  After eliminating a close personal friend, Bishop takes on the man's son (Jan Michael Vincent) as his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  This unauthorized act has consequences, as Bishop and his brash young apprentice Steve, complete an assignment in a rather messy fashion.  Bishop is aware that there is a price on his head, as he and his new associate depart for Naples on a high priority job.  Directed by Michael Winner (Hannibal Brooks, Death Wish films), The Mechanic was quite a hard edged thriller for its time.  It's rough around the edges and a bit simplistic in places, but Bronson gives a terrific performance.  The film was remade in 2011, with Jason Statham cast as the hitman Bishop.Assassination: (Rating: 3 stars)Bronson and his wife Jill Ireland appear together in a film for the final time, with Ireland starring as the wife of the President, and Bronson playing a secret service agent assigned to protect her.  While it doesn't have the tone of a pure action/comedy, there isn't a lot of realism in the story, which features a wayward First Lady, who finds herself the target of repeated attempts to kill her.  Production values are good, and there are some decent action scenes, in a film that has some sentimental value as Ireland's next to last movie appearance, before falling victim to cancer in 1990.Messenger Of Death (Rating: 2.5 stars)This film gets off to a shocking start, with the shotgun massacre of a group of women and children, but soon assumes made for TV sensibilities like a Matlock movie, as Bronson is a newspaper reporter investigating the murders.  Set in Colorado, the case features some angry Mormons seeking revenge, and a power play that involves a water company.  There are a couple of decent action sequences, but the level of action is generally below average for a Bronson flick.At ten bucks or less, this compilation is a good value buy for those that do not own any of the films.  The Mechanic is prime Chuck Bronson, while Assassination is a decent film with extra significance for Jill Ireland fans.  Messenger of Death is watchable, but is the least action oriented of the three.",4,a solid value buy for Bronson fans...,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2889,"['two', 'disc', 'set', 'released', '2010', 'contains', 'three', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'films', 'Mechanic', '1972', 'one', 'disc', 'Assassination', '1987', 'Messenger', 'Death', '1988', 'are', 'combined', 'second', 'disc', 'are', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'none', 'films', 'subtitled', 'Image', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'solid', 'value', 'buy', 'Bronson', 'fans', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'films', 'have', 'reported', 'problems', 'Mechanic', 'DVD', 'film', 'runtime', ""n't"", 'around', '100', 'minutes', 'contact', 'manufacturer', 'replacement', 'disc.The', 'Mechanic', 'Rating', '4', 'stars', 'Bronson', 'Arthur', 'Bishop', 'contract', 'killer', 'also', 'known', 'mechanic', 'film', 'nice', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'Bishop', 'assignments', 'eliminating', 'close', 'personal', 'friend', 'Bishop', 'man', 'son', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'unauthorized', 'act', 'consequences', 'Bishop', 'brash', 'young', 'apprentice', 'Steve', 'complete', 'assignment', 'rather', 'messy', 'fashion', 'Bishop', 'aware', 'price', 'head', 'new', 'associate', 'depart', 'Naples', 'high', 'priority', 'job', 'Directed', 'Michael', 'Winner', 'Hannibal', 'Brooks', 'Death', 'Wish', 'films', 'Mechanic', 'was', 'quite', 'hard', 'edged', 'thriller', 'time', 'rough', 'edges', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'places', 'Bronson', 'terrific', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'remade', '2011', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'cast', 'hitman', 'Bishop.Assassination', 'Rating', '3', 'stars', 'Bronson', 'wife', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'appear', 'together', 'film', 'final', 'time', 'Ireland', 'starring', 'wife', 'President', 'Bronson', 'playing', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'assigned', 'protect', ""n't"", 'have', 'tone', 'pure', 'action/comedy', ""n't"", 'lot', 'realism', 'story', 'wayward', 'First', 'Lady', 'who', 'target', 'repeated', 'attempts', 'kill', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'decent', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'sentimental', 'value', 'Ireland', 'next', 'last', 'movie', 'appearance', 'falling', 'victim', 'cancer', '1990.Messenger', 'Death', 'Rating', '2.5', 'stars', 'film', 'off', 'shocking', 'start', 'shotgun', 'massacre', 'group', 'women', 'children', 'soon', 'assumes', 'made', 'TV', 'sensibilities', 'Matlock', 'movie', 'Bronson', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'investigating', 'murders', 'Set', 'Colorado', 'case', 'angry', 'Mormons', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'power', 'play', 'water', 'company', 'are', 'couple', 'decent', 'action', 'sequences', 'level', 'action', 'generally', 'below', 'average', 'Bronson', 'flick.At', 'ten', 'less', 'compilation', 'good', 'value', 'buy', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'films', 'Mechanic', 'prime', 'Chuck', 'Bronson', 'Assassination', 'decent', 'film', 'extra', 'significance', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'fans', 'Messenger', 'Death', 'watchable', 'least', 'action', 'oriented', 'three']",N/A
