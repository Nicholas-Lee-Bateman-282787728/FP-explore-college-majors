He's expecting the guy is just in a jail somewhere and all he has to do is present his paperwork and buy the plane tickets. Ha. The bad guy (himself not a major factor, but I think his name was Larkin) has made bail and disappeared.Now, he and his lawyer (was THAT Larkin? Do I care?) were already shown discussing the idea that he take off for South America, so naturally both the audience and Brannigan suspect a fake when he is kidnapped. But to show it is real, the kidnappers send one of his fingers to his lawyer.So Brannigan, his Scotland Yard driver Jenny, and Captain Swann of the Yard (Richard Attenborough) are trying to find the kidnappers and also the bad guy. Meanwhile, Gorman, a hit man from Chicago, is stalking Brannigan and has been paid to kill him.They even included a western-style barroom brawl for no particular reason, except to be able to put a few cliches in a London pub.But in the second half of the movie, the pace picks up a bit, and the clues as to what is really going on start adding up. Most of those padding scenes were in the first half. So I changed my evaluation from two stars to three along about the 2/3 to 3/4 point on the little scale at the bottom of the player.

A minor picture to be sure, it follows the basic cop formula and offers few surprises, but it is surprisingly entertaining and breezes along nicely. Wayne playes a Chicago cop who is transported over to London in pursuit of a criminal(John Vernon). Once there he discovers his quarry has been kidnapped and here the story takes a few moderate twists.The film has some suspense and plenty of action but Brannigan's sense of humour is it's strongest asset.  Many of Wayne's latter movies were overly serious(The Cowboys, Cahill-US Marshall to name a few)so his return to the lighter approach is much appreciated.

666883,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00005N89K,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","This film has been what I like to call a Cuban Cigar Perennial Favorite. I used to have a cigar once a year (medical reasons) and couldn't stand to have more if I wanted.BRANNIGAN is one of the Cuban Cigar films. A perennial favorite though likely not to everyone's taste. And once again I can luxuriate in the work done by others and keep my critique short and sweet.I think it bears recalling that Wayne was THIS close to his final film (THE SHOOTIST) and was already losing weight rapidly. Keeping that in mind, it helps when noticing Wayne has very little screen time in this thing. What little screen time he has is spent riding around London. His lines are solid and his strength seems stable, but there is too much Rooster Cogburn in a lot of it.This film, I think, is overlooked because it shows how Wayne pioneered the tough-rouge-cop genre. To do so in London, alongside a young Sir Richard Attenborough...well, as I like to say, only the Duke! It's refreshing to see the way REAL explosions and shootings were filmed, back in the mid-1970s. We can't possibly match that today. Even my old lady was impressed with all the bombs going off--though she was angered by the double attempt on Brannigan. A shotgun waiting to hit you at the bathroom door, then a bomb in the toilet?--she said. Then she said, Did the assassin expect Wayne to go to the toilet after the shotgun had put a foot-wide hole in his chest?My only consoling remark was, it was the '70s. Fun, fun, fun. How else could Eastwood have gotten away with DIRTY HARRY? (Which he did very well.) Then again, it is this film right here that Seagal has copied ad nauseam. At least Wayne knew when to quit. Watching him here, I am saddened that he did not play a physician or scientist in some movie.In the end, I cannot recommend this for the dvd library unless you are a super-die-hard Duke fan. I'm one myself, but I will never own this...it's too slow, sagging and too little of Wayne in it, no matter how historic. Attenborough throwing some expert punches is hilarious fun, because he's such a little scrapper, but that is a negligible inducement to buy the video.However, watch it if you must.",3,"Here's to you, partner",1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,2166,"['film', 'been', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'Cuban', 'Cigar', 'Perennial', 'Favorite', 'used', 'have', 'cigar', 'once', 'year', 'medical', 'reasons', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'have', 'more', 'wanted.BRANNIGAN', 'one', 'Cuban', 'Cigar', 'films', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'likely', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'luxuriate', 'work', 'done', 'others', 'keep', 'critique', 'short', 'sweet.I', 'think', 'recalling', 'Wayne', 'was', 'THIS', 'close', 'final', 'film', 'THE', 'SHOOTIST', 'was', 'already', 'losing', 'weight', 'rapidly', 'Keeping', 'mind', 'when', 'noticing', 'Wayne', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'thing', 'What', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'spent', 'riding', 'London', 'lines', 'are', 'solid', 'strength', 'stable', 'too', 'much', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'lot', 'it.This', 'film', 'think', 'overlooked', 'how', 'Wayne', 'pioneered', 'tough-rouge-cop', 'genre', 'do', 'so', 'London', 'young', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'well', 'like', 'say', 'only', 'Duke', 'refreshing', 'see', 'way', 'REAL', 'explosions', 'shootings', 'were', 'filmed', 'back', 'mid-1970s', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'match', 'today', 'Even', 'old', 'lady', 'was', 'impressed', 'bombs', 'going', 'off', 'was', 'angered', 'double', 'attempt', 'Brannigan', 'A', 'shotgun', 'waiting', 'hit', 'bathroom', 'door', 'then', 'bomb', 'toilet', 'said', 'Then', 'said', 'Did', 'assassin', 'expect', 'Wayne', 'go', 'toilet', 'shotgun', 'had', 'put', 'foot-wide', 'hole', 'chest', 'only', 'consoling', 'remark', 'was', 'was', ""'70s"", 'Fun', 'fun', 'fun', 'How', 'else', 'could', 'Eastwood', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'DIRTY', 'HARRY', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'Then', 'again', 'film', 'right', 'here', 'Seagal', 'copied', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'least', 'Wayne', 'knew', 'when', 'quit', 'Watching', 'here', 'am', 'saddened', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'physician', 'scientist', 'movie.In', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'library', 'are', 'super-die-hard', 'Duke', 'fan', ""'m"", 'one', 'will', 'never', 'own', 'too', 'slow', 'sagging', 'too', 'little', 'Wayne', 'matter', 'how', 'historic', 'throwing', 'expert', 'punches', 'hilarious', 'fun', 'such', 'little', 'scrapper', 'negligible', 'inducement', 'buy', 'video.However', 'watch', 'must']",N/A

They don't even like having John Wayne around let alone his revolver. Wayne prefers the direct approach. Find a bad guy and MAKE him talk. Eventually, it is a blend of both styles that brings the perp to justice but there are plenty of twists and turns along the way. The kidnapper lead the police on several wild goose chases and they are not who they appear to be.The only one who can be taken at face value is John Wayne's character.

666891,A2O91YORQH16L5,B00005N89K,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[8, 9]","I recently watched the reruns of two action movies, McQ & Brannigan, both starring John Wayne, on cable TV. I had watched both of them in the theatres during the mid 70's or so.As a young boy, I have always enjoyed watching John Wayne in so many westerns (Stage-coach, Rio Bravo, True Grit...) & in so many war movies (Green Berets, Sands of Iwo Jima, The Longest Day...).I believe that John Wayne was almost in his late 60's/early 70's when he starred in the above two movies. I also believe that these were the only two movies in which he had played a street-wise no-nonsense cop. That's 'Dirty Harry' style!In the first movie, McQ, he was Police Detective-Lieutenant Lon McQ in Seattle. He investigated the death of his partner & along the way uncovered some corrupt elements in his police department with shady connections to the mob. The signature mobster in the movie, Manny Santiago, was played by Al Lettieri.In the second movie, Brannigan, he was Police Detective-Lieutenant Jim Brannigan in Chicago. He was sent to London to bring back an American mobster on the run, Ben Larkin, (played by John Vernon) & along the way he got entangled with the conservative work-style of Scotland Yard.Despite his age, John Wayne was really remarkable in both roles. Having seen him in so many westerns & war movies, it was refreshing to see him acting in contemporary settings. The hot-pursuit action sequences (car chases & shoot-outs) were really good, considering that era. In McQ, the car chase along the beach, with sea gulls fluttering away for cover, was magnificantly choreographed. In Brannigan, the car chase segment ending at the Tower Bridge was great, too. There was even a large-scale brawl at a London pub...reminiscent of John Wayne's innumerable westerns. The storyline in both movies was quite intriguing. In McQ, he even got to show off his physical prowess with an unlicensed sub-machine gun. That was cool! The dialogue in both movies was witty, too.In Brannigan, one could see how big & tall John Wayne was, when he was in London among the crowd. He really stood out like a sore thumb. His opposite was Commander Sir Charles Swann of Scotland Yard, played by a very fine British actor, Richard Attenborough. John Wayne even got a beautiful side-kick in the movie, Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher, played by Judy Geeson.In McQ, I was very surprised to see John Wayne in an intimate scene involving a junkie informer played by a fine actress (Colleen Dewhurst) in an understated role. This was something which had never happened in any of his other movies, as far as I know!On the whole, both movies had a good mix of action, drama & comedy, coupled with witty dialogue throughout.

666892,A1I9B4PSCDDWOO,B00005N89K,"lordhoot ""lordhoot""","[5, 6]","This movie probably deserves a 3.5 stars but being a John Wayne fan, I click for four instead of a three stars. While McQ was an overblown Dirty Harry wannabe type of film, Brannigan proves to be bit more mellow and laid back. Wayne, playing a tough Chicago cop, ends up in London trying to extradite one of his hometown criminals who ended getting kidnapped. The key element of this movie lies in the ""fish out of the water"" theme and its actually works well for John Wayne. Like in any John Wayne, the key element is how well John Wayne interact with his supporting players. In this film, he does very well with Judy Geeson and Richard Attenborough, both who gave great performances and had good chemisty with the Duke.Like some of his westerns, this film developed slowly, few action scenes inserted here and there with plenty of humor. The car chase scene and that fight in the bar proves to be pretty delightful in both elements of humor and action. I don't think Wayne was trying to mimick Dirty Harry here like he tried in McQ. Beside, that .38 that Brannigan was carrying is a pea shooter compared to a .44 magnum!Only negative sides must be the soundtrack which sounds very dated. It does all the wrong things like trying to get the audience's attention that something is about to happened. Also for a ""top dollar professional"", the hitman character in this movie proves to be rather inept. The director seem to be pretty heavy handed and the story suffered greatly because of it.While John Wayne does look bit old, I don't think this movie really taxed him that much. The film is bit refreshing because of the foreign location and the cast. John Wayne the American, really stand out among the more calmer British population. Change of scenary did the Duke well and help make up for the mediocrity of the film. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, it was entertaining and fun to watch despite of its flaws.The DVD that came out is nothing to scream about. The widescreen enchanced image proves to be clear but nothing exceptional.

666893,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00005N89K,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is a very honest albeit slightly aged (so 70's!) crime thriller, which will be especially appreciated by John Wayne's fans, but is also still quite watchable for all publics. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.This is the second and last crime thriller John Wayne turned in the 70s during the short-lived attempt to diversify his roles and try to follow in the steps of a much younger Clint Eastwood, after the enormous cultural shock of the first ""Dirty Harry"" in 1971. The Duke was actually supposed to play Inspector Callaghan, but he refused the role... The first of those films, ""McQ"" from 1974, was quite serious, but didn't perform as well as it was expected. Therefore for his next thriller John Wayne opted for a somehow lighter tone and also for a more ""westernized"" character, to re-connect with his usual fans when in the same trying to conquer a new public.""Brannigan"" is therefore a serious thriller with some tongue in cheek humour and some bravado elements usually seen in John Wayne's westerns. The story is about a Lieutenant of Chicago Police, James Brannigan (John Wayne) who travels to England to bring back an American gangster named Ben Larkin (John Vernon), arrested by Scotland Yard and awaiting extradition. This seemingly easy mission will be complicated by local English thugs, by Larkin's British lawyer Mel Fields (Mel Ferrer, fabulous as always), by the uneasy working relation between Brannigan and Scotland Yard's Commander Sir Charles Swann (Richard Attenborough) and last but not least by the professional hitman from New Orleans hired by Larkin to kill Brannigan (there is considerable bad blood between those two). A lovely young Scotland Yard Sergeant Detective Jennifer Thatcher (Judy Geeson) will serve as Brannigan's driver and assistant during his visit - however Brannigan being obviously a very senior man, with grown-up children, their relation during the film will be of quasi teacher/apprentice nature, with just some very gentle but charming verbal flirting.Without being a very good film ""Brannigan"" is a nice watch, with some rather gentle humour provided by the mutual cultural shock between the Yankee ""barbarian"" and the supposedly more cultured ""Limeys"". Brannigan's memories of war-time England (he served in European war theatre during WWII) provide also some nice conversation topics. Richard Attenborough gives a GREAT show in this film as the highly civilized, aristocratic Scotland Yard Commander and he clearly had the TIME OF HIS LIFE playing in this film. The difference in size between the two actors only added to the charm of their working relation (Attenborough is 170cm when Wayne was 193cm tall...).The elements of action borrowed from the western genre are particularly amusing and the main car chase is really hilarious. There is also one scene in this film involving the persistent hitman following Brannigan around London, that actually made me stand up in front of my TV, contrasting with the much lighter general tone of the rest of the movie...I think that this film was probably a distant inspiration for the classical ""Dempsey and Makepeace"" TV show in the 80s, although of course here the American character is too old to get involved with his British partner (and also Commander Swann is much more endearing than his equivalent in the series...).Bottom line, this is a honest, good film, not really ""Dirty Harry""-like, but lighter and merrier and showing that Merry Old England certainly never was the same after Lieutenant Brannigan was done with her...)))

Soon after arriving, Brannigan finds out that Larkin has been kidnapped by two hoods, which causes the Chicago cop more trouble than he ever figured on.  This is by no means one of John Wayne's best movies, but it is still entertaining.  Once again, Wayne basically plays himself, but what's wrong with that?  The movie has a good mix of action, drama, and comedy throughout.  Recommended viewing for one of the Duke's last movies.John Wayne plays Lt. James Brannigan, the tough Chicago cop sent to London to bring a crook back to the states.  After passing on Dirty Harry, Wayne made two movies about cops who live by their own rules, McQ and Brannigan(which was much better).  Richard Attenborough is very good as Commander Charles Swan, a Scotland Yard officer helping Brannigan find his man.  Judy Geeson plays Sgt. Jennifer Thatcher, the officer assigned to help Brannigan find his way around the city.  Mel Ferrer stars as Mel Fields, Larkin's attorney who may know more than he lets on.  John Vernon plays mobster, Ben Larkin.  The movie also stars Daniel Pilon, Ralph Meeker, John Stride, and James Booth.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation and a theatrical trailer.  Not Wayne's best movie by any means, but still worth a watch.

666908,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005N89K,trebe,"[2, 6]","A brief, mildly exciting car chase, and a few cheap laughs are not enough to recommend this movie.  The Duke is Jim Brannigan, a crusty Chicago cop sent to England to extradite a prisoner (John Vernon).  Things get complicated when the prisoner is kidnapped and held for ransom by persons unknown.  The muddled plot, then centers on efforts to recover the criminal.  But how much do we really care?The cast does what they can with a script that tries hard, but fails to be clever.  Richard Attenborough as a British top cop is serviceable, but dull.  Judy Geeson is a police officer who does little more than chauffeur the Duke, and act as a sounding board.In addition, a ""professional"" killer, hired to eliminate Brannigan, attempts to do so using some rather elaborate, but ultimately ineffective methods.  This loser can't shoot straight, or drive well, and the only one he succeeds in killing is himself.Probably the film's most memorable moment is the brief car chase sequence, which concludes with Brannigan jumping across a London drawbridge, and crashing on the opposite side.  Like Brannigan's car, this vehicle for an aging screen legend is a bit of a wreck.  If you want to see John Wayne as a cop, check out ""McQ"", which is a much better film, though it is not yet available on DVD.The DVD transfer is average, and the colors look a little washed out at times.

I grew up with the crime dramas of the 1970s, had little patience for Westerns, and am sorry John Wayne had so little time left to make detective movies. His other police drama, McQ, was trying so hard to imitate other ""gritty"" characters and films, was so formulaic, artificial, confusing, dreary, stiff, heavy-handed, and clich&eacute;, that these elements crowded out Wayne. Not so Brannigan.Wayne shined. He was natural and utterly comfortable and convincing in the role. He was likable, frank, good-natured, decent, down-to-earth, and tough -- ""so damn solid,"" as Geeson's character put it (to which he replied, ""Fat, you mean"") in a nice, genuine scene where Brannigan talked about wanting to catch the hood responsible for killing his rookie partner because it was his duty to protect the kid even though, no matter how ""nice a story"" it would make if the kid had been like a son to him, he had not even liked the ""smart-aleck"" kid. Wayne had terrific, commanding screen presence. He looked as fit and acted as vigorous as called for by the role. Suggestions in other reviews that he was ""too old"" or ""too fat"" are nonsense. The mature cast is a pleasant contrast to today's rampant superficiality.All of the supporting actors -- Attenborough, Geeson, Ferrer, Vernon, Pilon -- were real professionals who similarly brought substance to their roles and played them smoothly and effectively. The characters were nicely sketched. For example, Attenborough's titled Scotland Yard official was not a caricatured fop or dandy; he was polished but also appreciated rough, direct action to get the job done, which created a nice grudging rapport between him and Brannigan. Both the policeman and the hit-man were portrayed effectively in this movie, with the policeman actually outsmarting and outmaneuvering the hit-man in believable ways. The story had action, energy, purpose, and humor. The dialogue was smart, and the plot interesting, with some clever touches. The photography and music made it all the more enjoyable.This is a fun, smart, well-paced, well-produced detective story with a good plot, well-drawn and well-cast characters, and good locations. The movie is excellent entertainment. As such, I could not recommend it more highly. Reviewers who apparently failed to watch the film on its own merits and have nothing to offer but pseudo-sophisticated, overly general, cheap-shot criticisms do not do it justice.",5,Pure entertainment,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,2583,"['time', 'saw', 'Brannigan', 'theaters', 'kid', 'number', 'chances', 'watch', 'again', 'years', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'grew', 'up', 'crime', 'dramas', '1970s', 'had', 'little', 'patience', 'Westerns', 'am', 'sorry', 'John', 'Wayne', 'had', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'left', 'make', 'detective', 'movies', 'other', 'police', 'drama', 'McQ', 'was', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'imitate', 'other', 'gritty', 'characters', 'films', 'was', 'so', 'formulaic', 'artificial', 'confusing', 'dreary', 'stiff', 'heavy-handed', 'clich', 'eacute', 'elements', 'crowded', 'out', 'Wayne', 'Not', 'so', 'Brannigan.Wayne', 'shined', 'was', 'natural', 'utterly', 'comfortable', 'convincing', 'role', 'was', 'likable', 'frank', 'good-natured', 'decent', 'down-to-earth', 'tough', 'so', 'damn', 'solid', 'Geeson', 'character', 'put', 'replied', 'Fat', 'mean', 'nice', 'genuine', 'scene', 'where', 'Brannigan', 'talked', 'wanting', 'catch', 'hood', 'responsible', 'killing', 'rookie', 'partner', 'was', 'duty', 'protect', 'kid', 'even', 'matter', 'how', 'nice', 'story', 'would', 'make', 'kid', 'had', 'been', 'son', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'liked', 'smart-aleck', 'kid', 'Wayne', 'had', 'terrific', 'commanding', 'screen', 'presence', 'looked', 'fit', 'acted', 'as', 'vigorous', 'called', 'role', 'Suggestions', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'too', 'fat', 'are', 'nonsense', 'mature', 'cast', 'pleasant', 'contrast', 'today', 'rampant', 'superficiality.All', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Attenborough', 'Geeson', 'Ferrer', 'Vernon', 'Pilon', 'were', 'real', 'professionals', 'who', 'similarly', 'brought', 'substance', 'roles', 'played', 'smoothly', 'effectively', 'characters', 'were', 'nicely', 'sketched', 'example', 'Attenborough', 'titled', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'official', 'was', 'not', 'caricatured', 'fop', 'dandy', 'was', 'polished', 'also', 'appreciated', 'rough', 'direct', 'action', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'created', 'nice', 'grudging', 'rapport', 'Brannigan', 'policeman', 'hit-man', 'were', 'portrayed', 'effectively', 'movie', 'policeman', 'actually', 'outsmarting', 'outmaneuvering', 'hit-man', 'believable', 'ways', 'story', 'had', 'action', 'energy', 'purpose', 'humor', 'dialogue', 'was', 'smart', 'plot', 'interesting', 'clever', 'touches', 'photography', 'music', 'made', 'more', 'enjoyable.This', 'fun', 'smart', 'well-paced', 'well-produced', 'detective', 'story', 'good', 'plot', 'well-drawn', 'well-cast', 'characters', 'good', 'locations', 'movie', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'such', 'could', 'not', 'recommend', 'more', 'highly', 'Reviewers', 'who', 'apparently', 'failed', 'watch', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'have', 'nothing', 'offer', 'pseudo-sophisticated', 'overly', 'general', 'cheap-shot', 'criticisms', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'justice']",N/A
