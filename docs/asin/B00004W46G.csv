Although it's a bit off the beaten path of holiday classics, The Life and Adventures of Santa Clause captures the essence of some universal themes such as the struggles between good &amp; evil and the nature of humanity.

I was amazed at the beautiful animation and storytelling. The voice work of the actors was fantastic especially Dixie Carter as Necile.  I have watched just about every animated/stop motion Christmas special ever, but this one takes a special place in my heart.  It is rare and not widely known but it should be.  It is wonderful!  It has a charm that the Rankin Bass version does not.  I love Rankin Bass xmas specials especially Rudolph and the Year Without a Santa Claus, but there is room on the animation xmas landscape for gems like this one.  It is rather long but enchanting.  I think it will appeal to adults and older kids. I don't particularly care for the songs or the Awgawas goofiness but those are minor flaws.

We've been looking for a copy of this movie since we first saw it on Cartoon Network--- which was a VERY long time ago. So we've been searching for years with no luck. I saw the VHS on Amazon, but it is way too much money for an outdated viewing format... plus my brother and I want to keep this treasure for a LONG time. That's how important this film was to us.Every so often I would check around to see if it was finally available, and this time around it was! I texted my brother, who is away at college, ""Guess what I found?"" His immediate response was, ""Life and Adventures of Santa Claus?!?!?"" I was floored that he guessed on the first try. He told me that if I had said no he would be really sad. He is 21 years old! I'm 22.This movie became our own special tradition (usually our parents are involved, but not this time), and we would always sit and watch it on Christmas Eve after dinner but before Midnight mass when it played on CN. When they changed their Christmas lineup, we were sad and disappointed. We searched the channels and looked in stores but couldn't find it. We regretted not taping it off the TV.I guess the point to my story is, you won't be sorry getting this movie. It is about good will, kindness, and generosity. It will bring your family together and seem magical to your kids (even if they're preteens, which is when my brother and I discovered it). While looking for this film, we found the Rankin/Bass version, and HATED it. This is so much more beautiful, the animation is wonderful and the story doesn't come across as clunky as the R/B version. I feel for these characters and their issues... but the R/B version makes me care less.
