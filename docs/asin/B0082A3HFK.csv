Too many young or new directors make the same mistakes when they try to make their films ""edgy"", and this film is like a checklist of what not to do.1. Zero character development. We want to know why the characters act like they do.2. Scenes that should be only a few seconds long, stretched out for minutes and minutes.3. Jerky, swinging camera work that makes the viewer nauseous.4. Extremely quick cuts that disorient the viewer.All of this adds up to a movie that you KNOW is a movie.

The bitch gets kidnapped and tortured and harassed for quite awhile. The assailant just kind of curiously pokes at her and plays with her lifeless body for quite a bit since he overdosed her with sleeping aids. Its kind of important the length of time it take her to wake up in making the whole thing seem so real. Then this bitch screams and cries the rest of the movie, and I mean scream and cry. Its not in scenes, but constantly and so annoying th-at to the viewer, you are by the end of the film, just hoping this dude will kill her and not to end her misery but to make her finally shut up.

1544695,A209OROKAUU515,B0082A3HFK,itsjeremyblake,"[87, 100]","I had to write a review on this film because there are alot of negative reviews about it & having finally seen it, I wanted to put in my two cents. Alot of people are saying that this film is basically just torture porn, that it's exploitive just to be exploitive & that there is no point to the storyline. I guess people just don't get things when they first see them or they just don't have the intelligence to look further into the story like the filmmakers want them to.This movie starts out showing us the daily life of a prositute in Hollywood named ""Bunny"". This film does not hold back showing us Bunny's dark, empty reality & everything is shown raw because well, isn't that life? We see that she is pretty much dead on the inside, selling her body & her soul to feed her hungry addiction to drugs. After we are drawn into her world, we watch as she is picked up by a trucker named ""Hog"". Bunny thinks this is just going to be another trick that she's going to turn for money so that she can eat & buy her drugs. But what happens instead is a life-altering experience that is going to take her on a journey to a place darker than any place she could've ever imagined.Hog abducts Bunny & drives her out into a desert in California where they are completely deserted & isolated. He chains her up in the back of his truck & uses every way imaginable to taunt, humiliate, abuse, torture & break her, emotionally, spiritually & physically. He spits in her face, he slaps her, he forces her to crawl around the desert naked on all fours with a collar around her neck, he molests her, he films her every move & makes her watch everything that he's done to her previously. He tortures her mind & her soul. We watch someone who's life was so empty & who seemed so careless about her own life suddenly want to live that life like she never has before. She thought her life was as bad as it could get but she was wrong.**SPOILERS** This is where I'm going to explain the end of the film so if you don't want it ruined, skip this part. After 3 days of complete torture, Hog forces Bunny to play The Bunny Game. He puts a bunny mask over her head, a hog mask over his & chases her around the desert, playing hide & seek with her. When he finds her, he continues to humiliate & abuse her. At the end of it all, he holds two straws up to her & tells her to pick one. If she gets the longest one, she wins. If she gets the shortest one, he wins. We watch as a completely broken, changed Bunny picks on of the straws but we never find out if it was the long one or the short one...all we see is Bunny slip into a state of madness, laughing at either victory or complete loss. After this, Hog leaves Bunny lying naked, unchained in the back of his truck with the door left wide open. We watch as she wakes up, looks into the light & slowly crawls to it. This is because she has gone from feeling dead inside at the beginning of the film to finally alive by this point. She's never felt this alive. She wants to live. We watch her crawl to the light at the end of the tunnel. We watch her run, laughing madly at her freedom & then we see that Hog has caught up with her again. We see that he has completely driven her insane but words cannot describe how Bunny has changed. We can only imagine how she feels, wanting life, appreciating what she never appreciated, as she lies naked on a cross with Hog watching closeby. We don't really know what happens at the end of the movie but that's not the point. It's left up to your imagination.What is important in this film is Bunny's transformation. What happens to her is wrong but the point of this film is to show that the most horrific, darkest experiences that we experience in life can heal us & bring us to the light. They can make us look at life & the world in a completely different way than we did before. This is the story of a completely broken girl that gets humiliated & abused to the point where at the end, she's a completely different person. If you watch this film closesly, you will understand what the filmmakers are trying to say. It's a hard movie to get all the way through but if you can, you can understand the outcome & also use your imagination/opinion to decide what really happened in the end.I appreciated this film for what it was. I thought it was an artistic exploration of the human psyche & of life, in a very dark & twisted way. The cast is amazing. They really committed themselves to this film because they believed in it. There is more here than meets the eye. If you watch it empty minded, you will get nothing out of it. The only drawback to this film for me was the length. There are alot of long shots where nothing is happening. I can see how it would add to the ambience or the isolation the filmmakers are trying to make you feel but I just feel that the film could've benefited from being a short film.Overall, you are either going to understand this movie or you're not. But I definitely recommend checking it out if you are a fan of artistic type films or even horror. It is disturbing but there's more beneath the surface. When this film ends, trust me, it is one that you'll remember.",4,A trip into the darkest corners of your psyche... **SPOILERS**,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,5171,"['had', 'write', 'review', 'film', 'are', 'alot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'having', 'finally', 'seen', 'wanted', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'Alot', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'film', 'basically', 'just', 'torture', 'porn', 'exploitive', 'just', 'be', 'exploitive', 'point', 'storyline', 'guess', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'things', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'intelligence', 'look', 'further', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'to.This', 'movie', 'out', 'showing', 'daily', 'life', 'prositute', 'Hollywood', 'named', 'Bunny', 'film', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'showing', 'Bunny', 'dark', 'empty', 'reality', 'everything', 'shown', 'raw', 'because', 'well', ""n't"", 'life', 'see', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead', 'inside', 'selling', 'body', 'soul', 'feed', 'hungry', 'addiction', 'drugs', 'are', 'drawn', 'world', 'watch', 'picked', 'up', 'trucker', 'named', 'Hog', 'Bunny', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'trick', 'going', 'turn', 'money', 'can', 'eat', 'buy', 'drugs', 'what', 'instead', 'life-altering', 'experience', 'going', 'take', 'journey', 'place', 'darker', 'place', 'could', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'imagined.Hog', 'abducts', 'Bunny', 'out', 'desert', 'California', 'where', 'are', 'completely', 'deserted', 'isolated', 'up', 'back', 'truck', 'uses', 'way', 'imaginable', 'taunt', 'humiliate', 'abuse', 'torture', 'break', 'her', 'emotionally', 'spiritually', 'physically', 'face', 'crawl', 'desert', 'naked', 'fours', 'collar', 'neck', 'films', 'move', 'watch', 'everything', 'done', 'previously', 'mind', 'soul', 'watch', 'someone', 'who', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'empty', 'who', 'seemed', 'so', 'careless', 'own', 'life', 'suddenly', 'want', 'live', 'life', 'never', 'before', 'thought', 'life', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'wrong', '**SPOILERS**', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'explain', 'end', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruined', 'skip', 'part', '3', 'days', 'complete', 'torture', 'Hog', 'forces', 'Bunny', 'play', 'Bunny', 'Game', 'bunny', 'mask', 'head', 'hog', 'mask', 'desert', 'playing', 'hide', 'seek', 'When', 'humiliate', 'end', 'two', 'straws', 'up', 'pick', 'one', 'longest', 'one', 'shortest', 'one', 'watch', 'completely', 'broken', 'changed', 'Bunny', 'picks', 'straws', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'long', 'one', 'short', 'one', 'see', 'Bunny', 'slip', 'state', 'madness', 'laughing', 'victory', 'complete', 'loss', 'Hog', 'Bunny', 'lying', 'naked', 'unchained', 'back', 'truck', 'door', 'left', 'wide', 'open', 'watch', 'up', 'light', 'slowly', 'gone', 'feeling', 'dead', 'inside', 'beginning', 'film', 'finally', 'alive', 'point', 'never', 'felt', 'alive', 'live', 'watch', 'crawl', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'watch', 'run', 'laughing', 'madly', 'freedom', 'then', 'see', 'Hog', 'caught', 'up', 'again', 'see', 'completely', 'driven', 'insane', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'describe', 'how', 'Bunny', 'changed', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'wanting', 'life', 'appreciating', 'what', 'never', 'appreciated', 'naked', 'cross', 'Hog', 'watching', 'closeby', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'point', 'left', 'up', 'imagination.What', 'important', 'film', 'Bunny', 'transformation', 'What', 'wrong', 'point', 'film', 'show', 'most', 'horrific', 'darkest', 'experiences', 'experience', 'life', 'can', 'heal', 'bring', 'light', 'can', 'make', 'look', 'life', 'world', 'completely', 'different', 'way', 'did', 'before', 'story', 'completely', 'broken', 'girl', 'humiliated', 'abused', 'point', 'where', 'end', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'watch', 'film', 'closesly', 'will', 'understand', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'trying', 'say', 'hard', 'movie', 'get', 'way', 'can', 'can', 'understand', 'outcome', 'also', 'use', 'imagination/opinion', 'decide', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'end.I', 'appreciated', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'artistic', 'exploration', 'human', 'psyche', 'life', 'very', 'dark', 'twisted', 'way', 'cast', 'amazing', 'really', 'committed', 'film', 'believed', 'more', 'here', 'eye', 'watch', 'empty', 'minded', 'will', 'get', 'nothing', 'only', 'drawback', 'film', 'was', 'length', 'are', 'alot', 'long', 'shots', 'where', 'nothing', 'happening', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'add', 'ambience', 'isolation', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'feel', 'just', 'feel', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'being', 'short', 'film.Overall', 'are', 'either', 'going', 'understand', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'are', 'fan', 'artistic', 'type', 'films', 'even', 'horror', 'disturbing', 'more', 'surface', 'When', 'film', 'trust', 'one', ""'ll"", 'remember']",N/A
