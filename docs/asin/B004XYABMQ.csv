I hadn't seen her in a movie since "" The Dreamers"". Well I have to say that this is a breath of fresh air to film making. A very suspenseful potrayal of older woman attracted to a younger girl. And the stuggles she has with rejection and emotions for this person. The younger girl of course isn't interested and slowly figures out what is going on. And the older woman is tormented and takes matters in her own hands. A very intriging film indeed but depressing also in many ways.

1432898,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004XYABMQ,B. E Jackson,"[3, 3]","Cracks is the story about an all-girls Catholic school somewhere in the rich meadows of Ireland.  These girls are young teenagers and one of them in particular is considered the leader of the pack- she's the one in control and calls the shots.  Whatever she says, her classmates do as they're told.One day the teacher says they have a new girl attending the school- a talented swimmer from Spain.  The girls don't initially realize she possesses such a talent- it takes for a particular diving lesson to bring this exciting and surprising news to light.Well the other girls don't like this new girl at all.  They think she's spoiled and arrogant.  A ""daddy's girl"".  However the teacher actually likes her a lot... more than a teacher should EVER like a student in fact, which is the basis of this story.For the most part I was enjoying Cracks because it was unique watching a fairly strict Catholic school in Ireland.  Plus the main character -the one girl who's the leader- showed me some amazing talent.My only grip is that the storyline never really let us on to believe the teacher had a ""thing"" for this particular student other than a few scenes.  I suppose the late night swimming parties should have been obvious something was up, because the teacher was there with the girls in the water.  Otherwise the plot focused around the girls bickering, experiencing anger and jealousy, etc.However, absolutely NOTHING could have prepared me for the ending.  I wasn't expecting *that* to happen, haha.  What a surprise!  The storyline doesn't progress in a way that leads one to believe such an outcome is even possible.Overall, Cracks is a decent way to spend 90-plus minutes, but perhaps some more storyline development would have been nice.

The young teacher can't help but fall in love with her.  In this respect, you could say that the film resembles a girl/girl version of LOLITA as well.  Naturally, the other girls get frustrated with the situation, feeling that they are being left out of the attention of their favorite instructor.There is the framework of the film;  a story that details the pitfalls of a school that is overly strict and where the no-fun-rule is always in effect.

1432903,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004XYABMQ,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 4]","This is very much like the film ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie."" There is much to like here but the hand of God (the writer) comes down and forces the story.Here's the scoop. It's 1934 and Eva Green plays Miss G., a free spirited teacher in a stodgy English boarding school situated on an Island. She smokes, wears pants and tells her students of her adventures as she tries to free their minds and souls. Along comes an aristocratic girl from Spain with a mysterious background. The young woman throws a monkey in the wrench and the equilibrium of the relationships is in the balance.This starts out well enough. The situation is set up well and the sets, costumes and such are spot on. The viewer is right there with these people. The language seems right on with the time as well and you see how the lines are drawn. Miss G's girls love her. Particularly Di (Juno Temple) who will even share a cigarette with Miss G from time to time. She makes her girls feel special. But are all the adventures she shares with her students really from first hand experience? As it is said, those who can do. Those who can't teach. When the new girl, Fiamma, arrives Miss G's exploits are called into question, as is her past. There is a dark spot there that is not brought to light. And Fiamma herself is not at the school on a whim. There is a darkness there that is also alluded to. The problem comes in as the story progresses. I felt the writer begin to force the issue and I didn't believe it. You know that if a person has asthma, this will rear its head sometime during the proceedings. And did it really have to end as it did? Is Miss G threatened to the point that this would be the outcome? It were as though the story was written for the characters and not the other way around. And I took issue in that most of the girls below the level of Di were sketches at best.There is much to like here and for the most part it was a good watch, but it could have been so much more.",3,And Those Who Can't,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,1971,"['very', 'much', 'film', 'Prime', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Brodie', 'much', 'like', 'here', 'hand', 'God', 'writer', 'down', 'story.Here', 'scoop', '1934', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Miss', 'G.', 'free', 'spirited', 'teacher', 'stodgy', 'English', 'boarding', 'school', 'situated', 'Island', 'pants', 'students', 'adventures', 'free', 'minds', 'souls', 'Along', 'aristocratic', 'girl', 'Spain', 'mysterious', 'background', 'young', 'woman', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'equilibrium', 'relationships', 'balance.This', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'situation', 'set', 'up', 'well', 'sets', 'costumes', 'such', 'are', 'spot', 'viewer', 'right', 'there', 'people', 'language', 'right', 'time', 'well', 'see', 'how', 'lines', 'are', 'drawn', 'Miss', 'G', 'girls', 'Particularly', 'Di', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'who', 'will', 'even', 'share', 'cigarette', 'Miss', 'G', 'time', 'time', 'girls', 'feel', 'special', 'are', 'adventures', 'shares', 'students', 'really', 'first', 'hand', 'experience', 'said', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'teach', 'When', 'new', 'girl', 'Fiamma', 'Miss', 'G', 'exploits', 'are', 'called', 'question', 'past', 'dark', 'spot', 'not', 'brought', 'light', 'Fiamma', 'not', 'school', 'whim', 'darkness', 'there', 'also', 'alluded', 'problem', 'story', 'felt', 'writer', 'begin', 'force', 'issue', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'know', 'person', 'asthma', 'will', 'rear', 'head', 'sometime', 'proceedings', 'did', 'really', 'have', 'end', 'did', 'Is', 'Miss', 'G', 'threatened', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'outcome', 'were', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'characters', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'took', 'issue', 'most', 'girls', 'level', 'Di', 'were', 'sketches', 'much', 'like', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'good', 'watch', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more']",Cracks

This is a period piece (1934) that takes place in St. Mathilda's School in Stanley Island, England, an isolated all girl British boarding school. The mood is one of gothic evil where rich young girls participate in the cloistered rigid education imposed by the matrons of the school -Miss Nieven (Sin&eacute;ad Cusack), Matron (Helen Norton), and Miss Lacey (Deirdre Donnelly) - whose chief concern is to guard the reputation of the school at all costs, and lightened only by the presence of the swimming/diving coach Miss G (Eva Green) whom the girls admire for her exotic beauty, worldliness, supposed travel around the world, and her possessiveness of her brood.One of the girls, Di (Juno Temple in a brilliant performance), is the team captain and the apparent favorite of Miss G - until the sudden arrival of a beautiful Spanish girl Fiamma (Mar&iacute;a Valverde) who tends to set herself apart form the rest of the claque (Di, Poppy (Imogen Poots), Lily (Ellie Nunn), Fuzzy (Clemmie Dugdale), Laurel (Adele McCann) and Rosie (Zo Carroll).  Fiamma is an expert diver and her gifts as a sportsman as well as her beauty attract Miss G, replacing Di as her favorite.  In jealous rage Di gathers the claque and plans the exit of this unwanted intruder. How this backfires and increases Miss G's attraction to Fiamma leads down another path of evil that pulls this little tale of terror to a surprising end.Eva Green manages to make Miss G a fascinating character and her gradual obsession with Fiamma and the direction that takes her is a very fine performance.  But the entire cast  - girls and teachers  - is superb, especially Juno Temple in a career making role.  The cinematography by John Mathieson finds both the haunting beauty of the isolated St. Mathilde's School and the splendid panoramas of nature add immeasurably to the film as does the musical score by Javier Navarette - a score that combines Anglican hymns with gentle piano music.  This is a triumph for all concerned and bodes well for the career of Jordan Scott.

1432906,A2S29EES9TA9ZM,B004XYABMQ,hredzak,"[3, 4]","This was beautifully acted and intense.  But I don't think I could watch it again... for much the same reasons I don't care to watch movies like Heavenly Creatures and Boys Don't Cry again- even though they were also very well done.  Ultimately, just too dark and depressing.This one takes place at an all-girls British boarding school set on a remote island in 1934.  It centers around the relationship of a diving instructor and the relationship she maintains with her group of girls.  I was completely seduced by the teacher the moment she was introduced.  She glamorously strolls by all her girls with a knowing look and a flirty smile...  I so get it.  She's beautiful and elegant and inspiring and very capable of lavishing all her attentions on little ol' you.  The smoldering sexiness combined with her worldly, well-travelled persona seems to have them all seduced... particularly her diving captain who clearly controls all the others.  It's quite the set up.  Ms. G is the queen of her magical little kingdom of blossoming and adoring young girls.  If you ever had a beautiful or charismatic teacher you would do absolutely anything to please... Eva Green completely embodies that energy.Upfront I didn't imagine her as anything too bad.  She crosses enough lines to just be super cool and dreamy in the very beginning.  There's no blatant sign she's a lesbian, but we don't see her involved with men either.  Mostly she just seems like a ham for adoration and she uses her appeal to control her girls... particularly with her aggressive diving captain where there is some romantic tension.  But I felt it was kept at arm's length and used more as a manipulation because the captain is, as a result, emotionally loyal and keeps every girl in check.  However, when a beautiful and aristocratic student from Spain transfers in, the dynamic of Ms. G's group shifts dramatically.  Fiamma is an immediate outcast among the girls, but her diving skills and worldly attitude deeply impress Ms. G.  The teacher embraces her, but Fiamma is intuitive and defiant and sees through Ms. G's glamorous and seductive facade.  She isn't having any of it.  Ms. G soon falls into a creepy obsession with Fiamma.Overall, this was just depressing to watch the fall of Ms. G.  I was rather enjoying her initial seductive nature!  But this just got ugly.  She slipped into something diabolical and evil.  Like, disheveled and unkempt nervous breakdown evil... not Elizabeth Hurley in Bedazzled sexy-Satan evil.  Crazy evil.  The world she's built with her girls comes tumbling down.  Nasty stuff here.  Just plain sad, really.For those of you expecting some kind of Loving Annabelle storyline... forget it.  These two don't have anything like that going on. The student hates her.  The one intimate scene (no actual sex is portrayed) is predatory and more like pedophilia than the sensual teacher-student taboo fantasy portrayed in Loving Annabelle.  Definitely hard to watch.

1432908,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B004XYABMQ,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","This film is gorgeously photographed and unfolds an unusual story.  Juno Temple plays Di, the main character through whose eyes we view most of the action.  Di is a saucy suck-up to her dream teacher, Miss G.  Eva Green plays the central character of Miss G with great variety.  At the beginning, we see a beautiful woman with an air of mystery.  She masks so completely some of the later aspects of her character that we are startled.  When she devolves into lunacy, grasping for control, she is extremely scary.  The role is quite different from her work as Vesper in the two James Bond films, although even there she seemed to excel at duplicity.  Green certainly is a star-quality actress who keeps us glued to the screen.Spanish actress Maria Valverde plays Fiamme who comes to the school, apparently an outcast for some unknown reason, but is introduced as a princess.  She excels at diving, which puts her squarely in Di's sites who finds herself supplanted as Miss G's favorite.  Valverde brings a complex and richly colored performance to her role.  Irish actress Sinead Cusack does an excellent job as the head mistress of the school who covers up scandal.This film was a bit disturbing.  As my adult daughter who watched this with me pointed out, we don't usually think of pedophiles as female; so it was perhaps shocking for that reason.

Di Radfield (Juno Temple), the captain of the diving team dominates the other girls in the group. Di and rest of the team worship their diving teacher, Miss `G' Gribben (Eva Green) who weaves stories of adventure and intrigue for the amusement of ""her girls"".When Fiamma (Mar&iacute;a Valverde), a beautiful Spanish student arrives, she captures Miss G's attention much to the dislike of Di who has feeling for Miss G. When Fiamma rebuffs Miss G's advances and even challenges the validity of her adventures, the rest of the girls turn on her. After Fiamma disappears, the delicate facade of truth and lies begins to crumble and both the girls and Miss G are changed forever.Director Jordan Scott (daughter of Ridley Scott) has created a moody drama of academic rivalry and coveted secrets set in the cloistered environment of an island. The film, based on the novel written by Sheila Kohler, was filmed mainly in County Wicklow, Ireland.The glorious Eva Green portrays Miss `G' to perfection, her precarious grip on reality slips as truth and lies mingle, slowly revealing her true nature.

1432913,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B004XYABMQ,Only-A-Child,"[2, 3]","CAUTION:  SPOILERS AHEAD!One of the best films I have seen in years.  ""Cracks"" (2009) is a blend of ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brody"" (1969), ""Atonement"" (2007), and Lillian Hellman's ""The Children's Hour""; but ultimately it is unique enough to maintain considerable originality.  There was more of a ""Lord of the Flies"" homage in the source novel, what with its more savage African setting, but if anything the film works better with that replaced by claustrophobic and cloistered interior sets.  Jordan Scott  has great acting for-the-camera directing skills.  The principle casting is especially good with Maria Valverde excellent and Eva Green (much like Elizabeth Hartman) able to tap into her inherent shyness and bring a more powerful authenticity to her character.  And Juno Temple (a ringer for a young Glenda Farrell if you watch a lot of 30's films) is quite simply a force to be reckoned with, something you already know if you have watched her in other films.What follows is full of spoilers as I am trying to assist people in understanding the story.  So if you have not watched I suggest you stop reading and come back for the rest after your first viewing.  Then watch it again as like most really good films it withholds at lot of its pleasure for multiple viewings.So here are a few thoughts from my twisted mind:You only begin to understand what the screenwriter/director is trying to say when you realize that the story is being told entirely from Diana's (Juno Temple) point-of-view and the other characters are simply plot devices to illustrate Diana's coming of age story.  Miss ""G"" (Eva Green) is another Miss Brodie (Maggie Smith) and Diana is another Sandy (Pamela Franklin).  As in the 1969 film, the star pupil gets her back up when the teacher she worships finds someone else to be her student ideal.A key to both films is Tennyson's ""The Lady of Shalott"", which was quoted in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brody"". ""When the Moon was overhead, Came two young lovers lately wed; ""I am half sick of shadows,"" said The Lady of Shalott.""In the poem she is a magical being who lives alone on an island upstream from King Arthur's Camelot. Her purpose is to look at the world outside her castle window in a mirror, and to weave what she sees into a tapestry. She is forbidden by the magic to look at the outside world directly. Looking at the world in a mirror and depicting it in a work of art is an allegory for the life of a teacher viewing the world from an ivory tower and interpreting it for her young students.In similar ways Miss Brodie and Miss ""G"" are wonderful teachers and most young girls would have benefited from membership in their groups, mostly because of the breaking of conventions and the encouragement to openly explore the possibilities life offers.  But both have fatal flaws.  Miss Brodie is judgmental and irresponsible, full of misguided ideals and grievances, and totally confident that the world is as simplistic as she wants it to be.  Miss ""G's"" confidence, on the other hand, is a complete faade; hiding a brittle basket case who can only bloom in the protected niche of the school, despite her seeming openness to experiencing life.Both are downbeat films but ""Cracks"" considerably less so.  This is because while Sandy's depressing transformation into and betrayal of Miss Brodie was the principle dynamic, Diana ultimately wises up to the folly of what her teacher is about.  And Diana's atonement is a very positive one.Once you understand that Diana's growth is the principle dynamic, the rest of the story fits together rather smoothly. The fatal attraction of Miss ""G"" to Fiamma (Maria Valverde) is almost a Hitchcock McGuffin,  in that it provides a lot of character motivation but is ultimately just a plot device.Interestingly the climatic scene comes well before the end of the film.  It is the scene where Diana is helping Fiamma put on makeup for their ""Eve of St. Agnes"" feast.  The importance of the scene (and the reason they linger on Fiamma's eye contact) is that it is at this point that a part of Fiamma's spirit becomes a part of Diana, something which symbolically happened when Fiamma gave her the bottle several scenes earlier. And Diana takes both bottle and spirit with her when she leaves the island at the end.  In ""Jane Eyre"" this same dynamic occurs between Jane and Helen; with the gentle spirit of Helen passing to Jane and ultimately being the transformative force in her life.Although I love this climatic scene, my favorite scene comes a bit later when Diana is alone with the headmistress in her office. I think that I like it so well because for a first time director, Jordan Scott has an intuitive grasp of the limitations of sentimentality and she creates a scene which affects the viewer in a way they cannot help, and they cry. This can be wonderful but a director must carefully employ it because it will not work if the viewer picks up on ""false"" sentimentality. So unlike such scenes in many movies, Juno Temple (who has no lines in the scene) is not weeping, trying to get you to weep. Instead she is trying not to cry; and the scene is so much more powerful because of this restraint, the slick way the scene is edited, and the talent for nonverbal acting that Temple brings to the film.The ending of ""Cracks"" is both moving and intriguing, in large part because of the slick editing.  They cut between shots of the girls reading a note and shots of the exiled Miss ""G"" unpacking and staring at a photo of her team (after counting to be sure she only has five items on her nightstand).  Then the audio reveals it is Diana's atonement note, at which time the editor cuts to a shot of Diana sitting on the ferry with the book, the bottle, and their map.  The film goes out on a shot of Diana's face; as she is leaving the cloistered island to take the path in life that she believes Fiamma would have taken.Then again what do I know?  I'm only a child.",5,Outstanding,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,5942,"['CAUTION', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'One', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'Cracks', '2009', 'blend', 'Prime', 'Miss',

I love Miss G's style and grace, but this teaches us not to invest too much in what people show us on the outside. Man will always be surprising and naturally bad when not trained to be and do good. It also teaches us how some of us cannot control our desires. Desire allows us to achieve anything, but you still must control your desire.

A teacher (Green) at a boarding school for girls tries to teach them about real life.  When a new girl arrives at the school and takes Miss G's (Green) attention from her, Di (Temple) becomes jealous.  This is a movie that drags a little, but is still very good.  Eva Green's performance alone is worth watching this for.  The entire movie she keeps you guessing as to what kind of person she is. Just when you think she is helping the girls, something changes and you are not sure anymore.  I would compare this to ""Dead Poet's Society"", but a darker version of that movie.  I did enjoy this but again, it is pretty slow in parts but it is worth it to stay with it until the end.  Overall, this is a good movie, but not for everyone.  A very dark British version of ""Dead Poet's Society"" for girls.
