The fight scenes are unwatchable and the dialogues are quite poor. Wong Fei-hung (Jet Li) is out of character (for example: it's the first time that we see him giving long and boring speeches to everyone around) and some characters such as Foon Leung aren't even here. Also, you should see the bad make-up on the main villain... It's so ugly that you can't take the guy seriously.As for the DVD... It's one of the worst I have bought so far. The sound isn't surround, which is unforgivable for a movie done at the end of the 90's. There's a 2 to 5 seconds delay for the subtitles to appear on screen, which is pretty annoying. The quality of the picture lets much to be desired. A ratio of 2.35:1 would have been a better choice to show the movie instead of the 1.85:1. And what's the fun to watch a &quot;making of&quot; in Cantonese language without the option of having english subtitles to follow it?All in all, an episode to forget in the OUATIC series.",1,The OUATIC to forget!!!,974764800,"11 21, 2000",2000,1074,"['story', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'well', 'Shangai', 'Noon', 'quite', 'similar', 'much', 'better', 'just', 'badly', 'directed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'unwatchable', 'dialogues', 'are', 'quite', 'poor', 'Wong', 'Fei-hung', 'Jet', 'Li', 'character', 'example', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'giving', 'long', 'boring', 'speeches', 'everyone', 'around', 'characters', 'such', 'Foon', 'Leung', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'here', 'Also', 'should', 'see', 'bad', 'make-up', 'main', 'villain', 'so', 'ugly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'guy', 'seriously.As', 'DVD', 'one', 'worst', 'have', 'bought', 'so', 'far', 'sound', ""n't"", 'surround', 'unforgivable', 'movie', 'done', 'end', '90', '2', '5', 'seconds', 'delay', 'subtitles', 'appear', 'screen', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'quality', 'picture', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'ratio', '2.35:1', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'show', 'movie', 'instead', '1.85:1', 'what', 'fun', 'watch', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'Cantonese', 'language', 'option', 'having', 'english', 'subtitles', 'follow', 'episode', 'forget', 'OUATIC', 'series']",Once Upon a Time in China and America
444455,A3M4MIU0HIMUT9,6305020744,"Frank ""Monbois-86""","[0, 0]","It was nice to see the old gang together again, but this movie was by far the worst in the series. Because it was made for a Chinese-speaking audience, the acting skills of the English-speaking actors was irrelevant, and in most cases it shows. English Asian film authority Bey Logan always laments the poor acting of English-speaking actors in Chinese-language films, and this movie is no exception.Acting aside, the story itself meanders and makes little sense. [SPOILER ALERT!] Jet Li's character suffers amnesia and is taken in by local Native-Americans, doesn't learn a word of their language, marries a pretty Native-American girl, gets his memory back, returns to his Chinese comrades fighting the bad whities without a second thought to his whole Native-American experience, which could be a life-changing except that it all seemed to happen over the course of a day. The only point seemed to be to give his Chinese fianc&eacute;e something to be jealous about.I was very disappointed. I was hoping to see turn-of-the-century San Francisco, a hotbed of oppression against Chinese 100 years ago. Or the building of the trans-Atlantic railway which exploited cheap Chinese labor and then sent them all back to China. But none of that. Just a hohum tale of small-town bigotry.

444457,A13455BRIVPH9H,6305020744,Lonnie Turner II,"[7, 10]","Wong Fei Hung (Jet Li) comes to the states with his ever present love interest Auntie Yee (the delectable Rosamund Kwan) only to be lost in some white water rapids, rendering him an amnesiac and adopted by Indians.  His entourage begin searching for him but are limited by the fact that they're Asians in the old West.  Sammo Hung returned to directing after a long, unsuccessful period with this film.  If upon viewing the film seems familiar, it's because it was actually an early version of the recent Jackie Chan film &quot;Shanghai Noon.&quot;  I'm not calling Hung a rip off artist, as he's one of the most prolific, successful, and highly regarded Hong Kong directors of all time, but story has it that Hung, after a long streak of unsuccessful films, took the basic story as his own when Jackie Chan told him of his long time desire to make a modern Western.  Perhaps Hung did this due to the fact that he and Jackie had a falling out in the mid 80's which was only recently mended (the proof is the Sammo Hung directed MR. NICE GUY).  But even though Hung may have gotten the idea from Chan, you can't deny he did a good job with it.  Hung is a much better and capable director, in my opinion, than Chan, and has been for a long time, but for some reason Chan has managed to outshine not only Hung, but also Hong Kong superstars like Yuen Biao.  For those of you not in the know, Chan, Biao and Hung were all &quot;brothers&quot; at the Peking Opera School, all were trained torturously in martial arts, acrobats, acting, and stunt work.  As for Once...in America, it's not the best Jet Li movie, but it is a lot less sillier, and the fights more intricate, than most Jet Li films which are mainly period pieces and involve an embarrasingly large amount of wire work (as witness Tai Chi Master and most of the other Once upon a time films).  Hung proves himself once again to be a very talented director, as well as fight choreographer, but if you really want to see a great Sammo Hung film, check out PEDICAB DRIVER, MILLIONAIRE'S EXPRESS, or WHEELS ON MEALS, all with Sammo's special brand of razor sharp, intricate martial artistry.",3,If this movie sounds familiar.....,972518400,"10 26, 2000",2000,2144,"['Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'Jet', 'Li', 'states', 'ever', 'present', 'love', 'interest', 'Auntie', 'Yee', 'delectable', 'Rosamund', 'Kwan', 'only', 'be', 'lost', 'white', 'water', 'rapids', 'rendering', 'amnesiac', 'adopted', 'Indians', 'entourage', 'begin', 'searching', 'are', 'limited', 'fact', ""'re"", 'Asians', 'old', 'West', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'returned', 'directing', 'long', 'unsuccessful', 'period', 'film', 'viewing', 'film', 'familiar', 'was', 'actually', 'early', 'version', 'recent', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'quot', 'Shanghai', 'Noon.', 'quot', ""'m"", 'not', 'calling', 'Hung', 'rip', 'artist', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'successful', 'highly', 'regarded', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'directors', 'time', 'story', 'Hung', 'long', 'streak', 'unsuccessful', 'films', 'took', 'basic', 'story', 'own', 'when', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'told', 'long', 'time', 'desire', 'make', 'modern', 'Western', 'Perhaps', 'Hung', 'did', 'due', 'fact', 'Jackie', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'mid', '80', 'was', 'only', 'recently', 'mended', 'proof', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'directed', 'MR.', 'NICE', 'GUY', 'even', 'Hung', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'idea', 'Chan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Hung', 'much', 'better', 'capable', 'director', 'opinion', 'Chan', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'reason', 'Chan', 'managed', 'outshine', 'not', 'only', 'Hung', 'also', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'superstars', 'Yuen', 'Biao', 'not', 'know', 'Chan', 'Biao', 'Hung', 'were', 'quot', 'brothers', 'quot', 'Peking', 'Opera', 'School', 'were', 'trained', 'torturously', 'martial', 'arts', 'acrobats', 'acting', 'stunt', 'work', 'Once', 'America', 'not', 'best', 'Jet', 'Li', 'movie', 'lot', 'less', 'sillier', 'fights', 'more', 'intricate', 'most', 'Jet', 'Li', 'films', 'are', 'mainly', 'period', 'pieces', 'involve', 'embarrasingly', 'large', 'amount', 'wire', 'work', 'witness', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Master', 'most', 'other', 'Once', 'time', 'films', 'Hung', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'very', 'talented', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'fight', 'choreographer', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'PEDICAB', 'DRIVER', 'MILLIONAIRE', 'EXPRESS', 'WHEELS', 'ON', 'MEALS', 'Sammo', 'special', 'brand', 'razor', 'sharp', 'intricate', 'martial', 'artistry']",Once Upon a Time in China and America
444458,APIW11UEPKIC2,6305020744,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[3, 4]","So Sammo Hung decided to put his name into the history books by making the last Wong Fei-Hung movie starring Jet Li.  The movie starts off with Wong, Clubfoot, and Aunt 13 travelling across America to go visit Bucktooth at his new Po Chi Lam school.  Wong befriends a man named Billy and they become good friends even though they can't speak eachother's language.  Billy loves everything abouth the Chinese once he meets them especially their fighting skills.  During an attack the group gets split up and Wong hits his head on a rock and loses his memory.  He knows how to do everything he did before but he just doesn't know who he is or remember anythign liek that.  So Wong lives with Indians for a while before Clubfoot finally reminds Master Wong who he is.  As an injected subplot there are robbers who Master Wong, Clubfoot, and Billy have to take on in the final fight.Overall I was pretty dissapointed in this movie but it still had enough good moments to recommend it to people who have seen the other 4 Wong Fei-Hung films with Jet Li.  The movie just really doesn't know what it wants to be.  Some parts are over violent and while that wouldn't be so bad, Jet Li and everybody else can't make a single movement without it being wire assisted.  This does become bothersome but luckily Sammo slows down on it as the movie moves along.  As expected in a Sammo movie, it is hilarious at times but they should have made it just a comedy or a very serious movie and not tried to have a perfect blend of everything becasue they do anythign but.  The final fight is good but still below standards of other movies in this series, even the hard to watch #3.Also this movie has to be the best showcase for Xin Xin Xiong ever right up there with 'Hero of Heroes'.  Sadly he doesn't do much in the final fight but it is still a rare showcase for him.  Truly one of the best, or would have been if he could have gotten more of a chance.The version I have of this movie is from China Star Entertainment Group and also has the name of Win's Entertainment group on it.  The DVD is somewhat dissapointing with slightly below average picture quality and subtitles that constantly show up 5 seconds after the person has spoken making the dialogue very hard to follow.  There is a 30 minute making of on the DVD and even though most of it is is Chinese, about 7 minutes are interviews with Americans and overall it is very fun to watch.",3,A flawed entry in the OUATIC series but still a fun one,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,2428,"['So', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'decided', 'put', 'name', 'history', 'books', 'making', 'last', 'Wong', 'Fei-Hung', 'movie', 'starring', 'Jet', 'Li', 'movie', 'Wong', 'Clubfoot', 'Aunt', '13', 'travelling', 'America', 'go', 'visit', 'Bucktooth', 'new', 'Po', 'Chi', 'Lam', 'school', 'Wong', 'man', 'named', 'Billy', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'eachother', 'language', 'Billy', 'everything', 'Chinese', 'once', 'especially', 'fighting', 'skills', 'attack', 'group', 'split', 'up', 'Wong', 'head', 'rock', 'memory', 'how', 'do', 'everything', 'did', 'before', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'remember', 'anythign', 'liek', 'So', 'Wong', 'lives', 'Indians', 'while', 'Clubfoot', 'finally', 'Master', 'Wong', 'who', 'injected', 'subplot', 'are', 'robbers', 'who', 'Master', 'Wong', 'Clubfoot', 'Billy', 'have', 'take', 'final', 'fight.Overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'dissapointed', 'movie', 'still', 'had', 'enough', 'good', 'moments', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'other', '4', 'Wong', 'Fei-Hung', 'films', 'Jet', 'Li', 'movie', 'just', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'be', 'parts', 'are', 'violent', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'Jet', 'Li', 'everybody', 'else', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'single', 'movement', 'being', 'wire', 'assisted', 'become', 'bothersome', 'luckily', 'Sammo', 'down', 'movie', 'along', 'expected', 'Sammo', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'times', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'just', 'comedy', 'very', 'serious', 'movie', 'not', 'tried', 'have', 'perfect', 'blend', 'everything', 'becasue', 'do', 'final', 'fight', 'good', 'still', 'standards', 'other', 'movies', 'series', 'even', 'hard', 'watch', '3.Also', 'movie', 'be', 'best', 'showcase', 'Xin', 'Xin', 'Xiong', 'ever', 'right', 'up', 'there', ""'Hero"", 'Heroes', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'final', 'fight', 'still', 'rare', 'showcase', 'Truly', 'one', 'best', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'chance.The', 'version', 'have', 'movie', 'China', 'Star', 'Entertainment', 'Group', 'also', 'name', 'Win', 'Entertainment', 'group', 'DVD', 'somewhat', 'dissapointing', 'slightly', 'average', 'picture', 'quality', 'subtitles', 'constantly', 'show', 'up', '5', 'seconds', 'person', 'spoken', 'making', 'dialogue', 'very', 'hard', 'follow', '30', 'minute', 'making', 'DVD', 'even', 'most', 'Chinese', 'about', '7', 'minutes', 'are', 'interviews', 'Americans', 'overall', 'very', 'fun', 'watch']",Once Upon a Time in China and America
