30188,AB82EKHDKP2H8,0780621395,"""bixman71""","[7, 8]","Gary Sinise steals the show in George Wallace, the TNT documentary made about the three-time governor of Alabama and four-time presidential candidate. I honestly think Angelina Jolie, not Mare Winningham, should of gotten the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the movie. Winningham is a fine actress and portrayed her character well, but I thought she was rather drab. When Jolie takes over as the second Mrs. Wallace, she delivers her role with much more conviction and flare. Of course though, Sinise is the best actor in the cast and is most deserving of the award he got for Best Actor. Sinise's best role in my opinion, as you can likely guess from my review title, is his role in Truman, followed in a close second by his Lieutenant Dan portrayal in Forrest Gump, but this movie was a just as close third. I read one review of this movie which said the reviewer would have liked to see more about Wallace's 1968 campaign for President. I personally would have liked to see more about his '64 and '76 presidential bids because they have more historical signficance, being that his '64 run took place during the most controversial time in his career, the Civil Rights Movement, and it was his first presidential campaign. And I would have liked to see more of his 1976 run because he did best as a candidate. And, as history itself and the movie both dictate, people seem to forget that when Wallace became a segregationist, he was very much reluctantly drawn into it by the Ku Klux Klan, rather than he was always one as most everyone who knows of him thinks. I think this point to his character should have been better addressed. Besides these small flaws, the movie was great overall. I also found something in common between this movie and Forrest Gump. In both, Sinise plays characters who are marred by physical trauma, and both characters have some very negative things to say about their conditions. As I said earlier, this movie is great overall and well worth watching especially if you are a history/political buff.

30189,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0780621395,Gregor von Kallahann,"[20, 22]","It's hardly surprising that Ted Turner, a political animal if there ever  was one, would turn his TNT productions into a vehicle for politically  themed movies.  This film, along with &quot;Kingfish&quot; and &quot;Nixon  and Kissinger&quot; is the kind of product Turner no doubt loves to  sponsor.  Those of us who are closet political junkies ourselves, but who  may not have the time or inclination to read lengthy biographies of  well-known politicos, can at least begin to satisfy our social  consciousness jones with these usually worthy efforts._George Wallace_  is certainly that--a worthy effort.  It does not answer every question I've  ever had about the man, but it does provide us with a portrait of a very  complex, power-hungry individual, one who sacrificed principal for power  and who became a symbol of a kind of racism that he did not really fully  embrace.  At least as seen by scriptwriter Marshall Frady (on whose book  this film is based), Wallace had no particular ax to grind with the black  community and was primarily a populist who initially sought the support of  all the &quot;folks&quot;.  One gubernatorial defeat, however, was all it  took to convince him that despite his reservations about extremists like  the Klan, he would have to play the race card in order to win the  governorship of Alabama.And thereby hangs the tale--or would have if he  had not been shot at a political rally in 1972.  The film's take on Wallace  is that this event and the intense personal suffering that ensued brought  about his eventual personal and, to some extent, political redemption.  This may well be so, but writer Frady and director John Frankenheimer do  slip significantly in presenting this turn-about.  Wallace's conversion in  the film rings too many false notes.  I don't know if Wallace ever  spontaneously dropped in on a black Baptist church, for instance, but if he  did, it is all the more incumbent on the filmmakers not to portray the  event too hamfistedly. Only Gary Sinise's nuanced performance keeps that  scene from becoming an embarrassment. All too often Frankenheimer and Frady  seem to be going for the kind of cinematic shorthand found in politically  themed films.  Conversations become near tracts or simply clunky ways of  advancing the political story.Still there's no denying Frankenheimer's  ability to get a tough story across.  And the actors are generally  first-rate.(Only Joe Don Baker as Wallace's populist mentor winds up going  over the top).  On the distaff side, Mare Winningham(a subdued and graceful  steel magnolia--the kind of role Lee Remick once specialized in) and a  fresh on the scene Angelina Jolie give remarkable performances. Clarence  Williams III is solid as the (fictional) stoic black trusty who serves the  Wallace household for decades.  And, of course, a good ol' boy milieu as  presented here always presents juicy roles for character actors.  _Wallace_  is full of familiar faces, actors you've seen dozens of times before but  whose names you'll struggle to place. They seem to be having a grand old  time putting on the accents and affecting the mannerisms of the  South.Still it's ultimately Gary Sinise's movie.  His '97 Emmy was  richly deserved.  He is simply fascinating to watch here.  It's one of  those cinematic performances where you're first reaction is &quot;why did  they ever cast him...there's no resemblance whatsoever...&quot;  And in  within minutes you forget all that and become so caught up in the  performance that you can't imagine anyone else playing the part.",4,solid fare for political junkies,968630400,"09 11, 2000",2000,3573,"['hardly', 'surprising', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'political', 'animal', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'would', 'turn', 'TNT', 'productions', 'vehicle', 'politically', 'themed', 'movies', 'film', 'quot', 'Kingfish', 'quot', 'quot', 'Nixon', 'Kissinger', 'quot', 'kind', 'product', 'Turner', 'doubt', 'sponsor', 'who', 'are', 'closet', 'political', 'junkies', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'inclination', 'read', 'lengthy', 'biographies', 'well-known', 'politicos', 'can', 'least', 'begin', 'satisfy', 'social', 'consciousness', 'jones', 'usually', 'worthy', 'efforts._George', 'Wallace_', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'effort', 'not', 'answer', 'question', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'man', 'provide', 'portrait', 'very', 'complex', 'power-hungry', 'individual', 'one', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'principal', 'power', 'who', 'became', 'symbol', 'kind', 'racism', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'fully', 'embrace', 'least', 'seen', 'scriptwriter', 'Marshall', 'Frady', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'Wallace', 'had', 'particular', 'ax', 'grind', 'black', 'community', 'was', 'primarily', 'populist', 'who', 'initially', 'sought', 'support', 'quot', 'folks', 'quot', 'One', 'gubernatorial', 'defeat', 'however', 'was', 'took', 'convince', 'reservations', 'extremists', 'Klan', 'would', 'have', 'play', 'race', 'card', 'order', 'win', 'governorship', 'Alabama.And', 'tale', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'shot', 'political', 'rally', '1972', 'film', 'take', 'Wallace', 'event', 'intense', 'personal', 'suffering', 'ensued', 'brought', 'eventual', 'personal', 'extent', 'political', 'redemption', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'so', 'writer', 'Frady', 'director', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'do', 'slip', 'significantly', 'presenting', 'turn-about', 'Wallace', 'conversion', 'film', 'rings', 'too', 'many', 'false', 'notes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Wallace', 'ever', 'spontaneously', 'dropped', 'black', 'Baptist', 'church', 'instance', 'did', 'more', 'incumbent', 'filmmakers', 'not', 'portray', 'event', 'too', 'hamfistedly', 'Only', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'keeps', 'scene', 'becoming', 'embarrassment', 'too', 'often', 'Frankenheimer', 'Frady', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'shorthand', 'found', 'politically', 'themed', 'films', 'Conversations', 'become', 'near', 'tracts', 'simply', 'clunky', 'ways', 'advancing', 'political', 'story.Still', 'denying', 'Frankenheimer', 'ability', 'get', 'tough', 'story', 'actors', 'are', 'generally', 'first-rate', 'Only', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'Wallace', 'populist', 'mentor', 'up', 'going', 'top', 'distaff', 'side', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'subdued', 'graceful', 'steel', 'magnolia', 'kind', 'role', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'once', 'specialized', 'fresh', 'scene', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'give', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'solid', 'fictional', 'stoic', 'black', 'trusty', 'who', 'Wallace', 'household', 'decades', 'course', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'milieu', 'presented', 'here', 'always', 'juicy', 'roles', 'character', 'actors', '_Wallace_', 'full', 'familiar', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozens', 'times', 'names', ""'ll"", 'struggle', 'place', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'grand', 'old', 'time', 'putting', 'accents', 'affecting', 'mannerisms', 'South.Still', 'ultimately', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'movie', ""'97"", 'Emmy', 'was', 'richly', 'deserved', 'simply', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'here', 'one', 'cinematic', 'performances', 'where', ""'re"", 'first', 'reaction', 'quot', 'why', 'did', 'ever', 'cast', 'resemblance', 'whatsoever', 'quot', 'minutes', 'forget', 'become', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'part']",N/A

30192,A1FNW6H983I87V,0780621395,"Loves To Read ""Lu""","[4, 4]","The film begins with Wallace and second wife, Cornelia (Jolie), passionately embracing on the bed. It seems an odd beginning but as we learn later, this would be the last or one of the last times George Wallace experienced any physical pleasure. The movie then begins a series of flashbacks and flash forwards of the life of this man who become such a lightning rod for the civil rights movement in America. He came to represent what so many saw as what was wrong with the South and their policies of segregation. Wallace's campaign slogan became 'segregation now, segreation tomorrow, segregation forever'. Was he a true racist or a populist who played the cards he thought would get him elected. He ran for governor of Alabama four times and for president four times. Many thought he had a serious chance to be elected President before the assassination attempt. This would have been the reverse of what happened in 2008, only 36 years earlier. Is this a summary of how far our country has come in the last four decades or was Wallace simply a political aberration? This is an outstanding film, the acting (especially Sinise) is terrific and it gives a balanced picture of this unusual politician. George Wallace is a very real part of American history and anyone under 40, especially, should watch this to understand why the subject of racism, while different than the 60's, has not gone away. There are actual archival scenes of civil rights protest mixed in the film. It is a three hour mini-series, not the 370 minutes it says on Netflix.

Like many older Southern whites, he began by taking Black people for granted but morphed into a volatile segregationist who finally sees the error of his ways and seeks forgiveness in a Black church in his wheelchair, a very moving and tense scene. Sinese is outstanding. He's usually calm and cool and smooth in most of this other roles, but as George Wallace, he reveals a range not seen before.Technically, this is a superb film; black and white footage mixed and blended with color, fading from authentic news footage to Sinese's outstanding performance. They've got the accents down pretty well but Angelina Jolie seems miscast somehow. Despite that, the film chronicles pretty well the history of that era and of George Wallace's career.I found myself glued to the film. The addition of a fictional character, Archie, as Wallace's valet was a stroke of genius for one reason; Clarence Williams III's excellent performance illustrated the suppressed rage of Black people against white people.

30198,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,0780621395,The Peripatetic Reader,"[1, 1]","In life George Wallace was an arrogant, confrontational, defiant, and irascible individual. If Bull Connor represented the segregationist South to early Baby Boomers, George Wallace took up that mantel and represented the last face of segregation to Middle Boomers.This television movie miniseries does a good job of showing the major events which informed the life of George Wallace, but it falls far short in showing his public face, which was not much different from the private George Wallace. Gary Sinese has the Alabama accent down, and he has the mannerisms perfected. What is lacking, however, is that omnipresent, pugnacious, sneer which said, ""Come one, throw the first punch. I dare you."" Sinese's Wallace is a dandified, sanitized, Northern version of the man, which doesn't, if this word could be used in connection with George Wallace, do him justice.George Wallace in life had a look of menace and danger which is absent in Sinese's demeanor.Since this was a movie intended to be a televison miniseries, the fine director, John Frankenheimer, probably could not present a more accurate depiction of the real person. The truth would have been far too ugly to broadcast on national TV. Besides, the nation got enough of that when he was alive.The movie, though, does a good job of portraying Wallace's change of heart. In life, that change occurred while Wallace was campaigning for president in 1972, when he was beginning to moderate his views. This is when, of course, Bremer attempted to assassinate him. Once wheel-chair bound, he shed whatever bigoted views a man could possibly discard in one lifetime.  That transformation is truly a wonder to behold.Angelina Jolie plays Wallace's second wife, and thankfully her part is relatively minor.
