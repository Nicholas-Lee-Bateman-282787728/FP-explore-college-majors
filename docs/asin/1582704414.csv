It could have been done so eloquently, and yet could have is the opperative word here. Being somewhat versed in quantum theory, I understood some of what was being discussed. However, much of the discussion pertained to elementary concepts and not all of these concepts were presented accurately. It was somewhat ""dumbed down"" and lacked scientific truth. The ""scientists"" appeared to be reading off of a contrived script and were not very intelligently arguing the points. This movie raised some interesting and intriguing questions but the theological questioning of god and religion was very biased and had no scientific evidence. Much of the movie misused scientific thought and tried to make it malliable to the presenter's view points.Even distinguished members of the scientific community, namely in articles in ""Scientific American"" and such have come out against this film and its faulty views. Apparently the rabbit hole only skimmed the surface and was ill-constructed...The movie could have been great...But I was fairly disappointed...What the bleep do they know?",3,What the Bleep Do THEY Know?,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,1164,"['film', 'What', 'Bleep', 'Do', 'Know', 'had', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'good', 'premise', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'eloquently', 'yet', 'could', 'have', 'opperative', 'word', 'here', 'Being', 'somewhat', 'versed', 'quantum', 'theory', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'discussed', 'However', 'much', 'discussion', 'pertained', 'elementary', 'concepts', 'not', 'concepts', 'were', 'presented', 'accurately', 'was', 'somewhat', 'dumbed', 'down', 'lacked', 'scientific', 'truth', 'scientists', 'appeared', 'be', 'reading', 'contrived', 'script', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'intelligently', 'arguing', 'points', 'movie', 'raised', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'theological', 'questioning', 'god', 'religion', 'was', 'very', 'biased', 'had', 'scientific', 'evidence', 'Much', 'movie', 'misused', 'scientific', 'thought', 'tried', 'make', 'malliable', 'presenter', 'view', 'points.Even', 'distinguished', 'members', 'scientific', 'community', 'namely', 'articles', 'Scientific', 'American', 'such', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'film', 'faulty', 'views', 'Apparently', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'only', 'skimmed', 'surface', 'was', 'ill-constructed', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'was', 'fairly', 'disappointed', 'What', 'bleep', 'do', 'know']",N/A
192669,A6NJ1GAUXC1JW,1582704414,A Customer,"[12, 20]","For some reason I had to give this product 5 stars in order for my review to get printed - hmmmmm... now on to my real review:Part nonsense/part propaganda, ""What the Bleep Do We Know,"" is 90 corny and creepy minutes of pure horse manure.  If I read another review mentioning the ""science"" in this thing, I'm going to wretch.  There's about as much science to this piece of cr@p as an episode of Star Trek.  Actually, there's a lot more science to an episode of Star Trek...Its a pretty sad statement of the times if people in our culture need to find meaning in life from a charlatan who claims to channel the 35,000 year old spirit of a cromagnon warrior from Atlantis.THIS is what I what I know- WTBDWK is a 90 minute indoctrination piece for the cult of Ramtha - a bunch of frauds that took a page right out of the book of the Scientologists and Moonies on how to make a fortune and build an empire by preying on the unsophisticated, unintelligent, and weak-minded.  New Age con-artists of the 21st Century.J.Z. Knight, the ""leader,"" claims that she is Ramtha's channel. She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood's version of  Elizabethan English in a guttural, husky voice.She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars ($1,000 a crack) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment, and from the sales of tapes, books, and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). She must have hypnotic powers. Searching for self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold, muddy, doorless maze. In the dark, they seek what Ramtha calls the `void at the center.'What the Bleep serves as one of the most commercially successful hoaxes of 2004 - and probably of the 21st Century.

Not the kind of move you want to stop and start unless you are trying to figure it out.  It is science mixed with misticsm like they said with a main character story line mixed within.  The main character has a different sensory experience because she is deaf, but that does not begin to explain it.  It is more what the bleep is this movie, but it is great anyway.  It makes more questions in the mind than answers.  Alice in Wonderland?? I do not know if I agree with that.  It is more intellectual meets mystical with a fiction story within.  It is a non fiction/fiction movie.  It is part fact, part theory, part faith and part fiction.  How the Bleep is this possible?

192671,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,1582704414,Adrien Caldwell,"[5, 6]","I was recommended this film quite awhile back and had finally received it from Netflix just the other day. I wanted to watch it again but lent it to my parents for them to watch.I know quite a few of you only gave this movie one star. You've pointed out that a lot of what's been covered in the movie is a lot of ""flap doodle."" But let me just go over a few things that have really helped me.The part of the movie that covered peptides and emotions and how they can physiologically affect us was really fascinating to me. When they talked about how we can be addicted to emotions (whether good or bad) I finally realized that I was addicted to negative thought patterns that I've been aware of for years. These thoughts would bother me and I would try to do my best to think of something else. It was like I had no control over my thoughts or my own mind. I never considered myself an addictive person. I don't do drugs nor do I drink. So, since watching the movie, every time I find myself indulging in negative thoughts I quickly remind myself that I must be addicted to these angry, sad or other negative emotions and I immediately correct myself. I can't explain how self-empowering this has become for me. I can already see a positive difference in my life.Another point made in the movie also helped me a lot. It has to do with the concept of God and either being punished or rewarded for being a bad or good person. One person said (and I can't remember the exact words) that ""God is the highest elevated spirit within all things. We are God."" And it made me wonder about the concept of our ""higher selves and that perhaps all of our higher selves are connected in someway. I have to admit, it makes me ponder with some enthusiasm as I have been quite disappointed with traditional religions and have become a bit hopeless as to what really is out there for us beyond this life.I guess, if I were into metaphysics perhaps I'd be disappointed with this movie as well. I would have to say that my perspective is more like a mystic's. I went into watching this movie with a totally open mind, no expectations, and I got so much from it.",5,It's working for me.....,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,2140,"['was', 'recommended', 'film', 'quite', 'awhile', 'back', 'had', 'finally', 'received', 'Netflix', 'just', 'other', 'day', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'lent', 'parents', 'watch.I', 'know', 'quite', 'few', 'only', 'gave', 'movie', 'one', 'star', ""'ve"", 'pointed', 'out', 'lot', 'what', 'been', 'covered', 'movie', 'lot', 'flap', 'doodle', 'let', 'just', 'go', 'over', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'really', 'helped', 'me.The', 'part', 'movie', 'covered', 'peptides', 'emotions', 'how', 'can', 'physiologically', 'affect', 'was', 'really', 'fascinating', 'When', 'talked', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'addicted', 'emotions', 'good', 'bad', 'finally', 'realized', 'was', 'addicted', 'negative', 'thought', 'patterns', ""'ve"", 'been', 'aware', 'years', 'thoughts', 'would', 'bother', 'would', 'try', 'do', 'best', 'think', 'something', 'else', 'was', 'had', 'control', 'thoughts', 'own', 'mind', 'never', 'considered', 'addictive', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'drugs', 'do', 'drink', 'So', 'watching', 'movie', 'time', 'find', 'indulging', 'negative', 'thoughts', 'quickly', 'remind', 'must', 'be', 'addicted', 'angry', 'sad', 'other', 'negative', 'emotions', 'immediately', 'correct', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'self-empowering', 'become', 'can', 'already', 'see', 'positive', 'difference', 'life.Another', 'point', 'made', 'movie', 'also', 'helped', 'lot', 'do', 'concept', 'God', 'either', 'being', 'punished', 'rewarded', 'being', 'bad', 'good', 'person', 'One', 'person', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exact', 'words', 'God', 'highest', 'elevated', 'spirit', 'things', 'are', 'God', 'made', 'wonder', 'concept', 'higher', 'selves', 'perhaps', 'higher', 'selves', 'are', 'connected', 'someway', 'have', 'admit', 'ponder', 'enthusiasm', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'traditional', 'religions', 'have', 'become', 'bit', 'hopeless', 'what', 'really', 'out', 'there', 'life.I', 'guess', 'were', 'metaphysics', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'perspective', 'more', 'mystic', 'went', 'watching', 'movie', 'totally', 'open', 'mind', 'expectations', 'got', 'so', 'much']",N/A
192672,AHL35XZ3OND2Z,1582704414,Adron Gardner,"[6, 9]","""Scientists spend their days confronting what they don't understand...It cannot be that reality depends on our existence"" ---  Lee SmolinThose words aren't  something the makers of this film have confronted.  If you didn't already know, the producers selectively  edited interviews and stacked arguments to ""explain"" quantum mechanics.  Don't take it more than what it is - a veiled recruitment film for the Ramtha cult.  Look it up people.Before the 16th century, most people's thoughts said the universe revolved around the Earth.  Thanks to Nicolaus Copernicus we know we simply revolve around an ordinary star.  Our thoughts did not cause this to happen, it has been this way for nearly 5 billion years.Before modern humans, dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions upon millions of years.  Their thoughts did not create homosapiens, we rose into being in a complex string of chance and time developed genetic advances over the entire 4.5 billion year evolution of the earth - and itself from the elements created in the evolution and death of stars that came before our own solar system.Before 1923 we didn't know there were other galaxies besides ours.  We didn't create those galaxies in our mind.  They existed long before we did.Movie disproven, move along.  Go watch an episode of Star Trek instead.My critical analysis is almost unnecessary.  This is a companion piece to ""the Secret,"" another garbage can of no ideas taking advantage of the weak and ignorant for a buck. The only thing missing in this science fiction story, is Captain Xenu.  But they do have a certified Chiropractor as an ""expert"" witness.  I am not joking.  No, photons do not ""think"" or react to our will.  Scientists don't have the luxury of simply making stuff up to accommodate flawed human senses like these filmmakers - that is the job of religion and that is what this movie is all about.  Phenomena covered in this film are glossed over with amazingly simplistic explanations.  Quantum mechanics is the most powerful triumph in the history of science.  It is also incredibly complicated and every great mind in the field from its inception has struggled with the theory to this very day.  An aspect of QM, and proven in practice, says in the world of the smallest pieces of matter and energy, no precise amount can be absolutely known - in effect, the aspect of measuring the object disturbs it's state so we can only know the general idea of a state - though thanks to people like Feynman - we can know it to an astounding degree of accuracy.  The movie doesn't confront that side of it.  Nope this movie is about how your thoughts create reality.  So even though billions of people have lived and died - their thoughts with them - why can I sit here and type this review?Ploys like this film aim to label science as some monolithic sovereignty we never question and propose how mind blowing something is we don't know the answer to and then propose we can control it with consciousness.  If science was all nonsense made of our own minds, cell phones, computers, satellites, MRI, GPS and even the DVD this is printed to would never have been made.  The human mind did not create the universe, it is a consequence of it.This Jedi mind trick is engaged without any serious authority or serious debate.  It's just a bunch of new agey feel goodness advertising the old ANTHROPIC principle for the profit of a bunch of fruit cakes called Ramtha.  Alchemy, eugenics and this all go together nicely in the great big book of bleeping bull.  Also, to the people who thinks this movie is smart - it isn't.  This is the equivalent of a dictionary where all the spelling is wrong -- please look into topics covered in the film on your own time. If you watch this film and don't realize by the end you've been hoodwinked by an infomercial, then you are beyond help.So despite the title of ""What the bleep do we know..."" the movie does love to dole out explanations. That's usually the sort of irony you hear in a church revival just before they hand out the collection plate. In short, obviously this is a negative, and sarcastic, review and there is no use in beating a dead horse.  You'll get more positive mental development from carbon monoxide poisoning.  However, if your mind gets a workout from this stuff, then you'd also be blown away to know that an ice cube is just frozen water.

192673,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1582704414,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[25, 39]","What a hugely disappointing film this was.  After seeing the previews and several of the clips, I was ready to see the world from a new perspective and perhaps build some insight into the world of quantum physics.  After watching the entire film, I discovered that loonies and crackpots speak as if they rule this world because of the knowledge that they contain.  Instead of giving us leading people to guide us through this uncharted world of quantum physics, the directors of this documentary used a chiropractor and a woman named Ramtha along with a couple other people that seemed crazier and crazier as the film progressed.  Now, I want to make it clear that these subjects were actually crazy, not because of the topic they were discussing, but because of the way they spoke about it.  I think this is what lead to the incoherent mess of the film.Our topics jumped from place to place, hardly spending enough time on any one to fully grasp the intentions of the film.  The only subject that our guides seemed most excited about was the entire ""sex-capade"" at the wedding.  Suddenly, the tone of the lecture changed and this NR rated film suddenly went to PG-13 as if the directors wanted to reach a younger audience.  The choice of computer graphics and song had nobody in my theater laughing, in fact some left early.  It just didn't seem to fit with what we were learning earlier.  This was a complete 180 from the early part of the film, and it did not brood well.  Marlee Matlin didn't even seem comfortable with what she was doing on screen.  Suddenly, the party is over and we are left with a conversation about God.  This was not what a film about science needed.  It was as if we had gone from bad to even worse.  I felt the directors were trying to suddenly justify their reasoning for the ill-fated wedding scene prior.  Either way, it bombed and ended up blowing this film into a million pieces.In the mess of all this film, there were one or two good points that left you with something to ponder, like the Indians and not being able to see Columbus' ships for the first time.  The idea behind the path of choices as well as the effect of emotion on water was a very interesting study, but these were very small elements to a very large destructive picture.  For me this film mainly did not work because the people trying to educate us about quantum physics were not trying to explain it to us in a entertaining way, they were literally speaking over us forcing me, as well as others in the audience, to remember life back in Physics 101 and the quality of naps.  I continually felt that after leaving the theater there would be people meeting me at the door asking me if I would like to drink their punch.  These guides were not talking to me about quantum physics, but instead talking above me.  They knew they were better, and the arrogance shined through the silver screen.  I blame the directors for their choices because a better choice could have altered the mood of the film altogether.Overall, I was very misinformed and uneducated after I left this theater.  The film was a bomb and I am constantly surprised by how much it has grossed already (though it has been playing for just about a year). The structure of the film coupled with the annoying ""specialists"" only helped debunk the whole premise.  The non-documentary aspect of this film also failed, constantly having me wonder why Marlee Matlin was chosen to do this project.  Nothing seemed to work in this film except for the ability to cause me a massive headache.  For those hoping for a purely scientific film, I think you will be very disappointed.

192675,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,1582704414,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[6, 10]","A blend of fact and fiction, with documentary footage combined with a film about a photographer whose life is being impacted by ""other realities,"" ""What the Bleep"" works best as a documentary, with the plot sections being a bit labored, and really bogging down in a lengthy wedding sequence.Many of the questions raised by those being interviewed are thought provoking, and explore the possibilities that quantum physics has brought to our universe. The theories are fascinating, as they imply that our inner world influences our outer world, rather than the commonly thought reasoning that we are creatures of our environment, but some the answers range from excellent to ludicrous. The biggest ""red flag"" entry in the nonsense category is the statement from Dr. Candace Pert, who claims that Columbus' ships were invisible to the natives because they had never encountered ships before, and were not able to see them until their shaman revealed them. It would be interesting to compare the size of the dugout canoes used by the natives, which were huge, and Columbus' ships, which were very small.As psychiatrist Jeffrey Satinover states in his interview concerning reality, ""Anyone who spends too much time trying to explain it is likely to get lost in the rabbit hole,"" and this is what tends to happen, including many cookie cutter responses on religion, and questionable theories on morality.The good part of this film is that it challenges the meaning of existence, and if it leads anyone who has not already done so to ask ""who am I and what am I doing with my life ?,"" and to further their knowledge of quantum physics, the film has been a great benefit, but there is a danger that the scenario of Dr. Pert's mythical natives and shaman will be repeated, wrapped up in a New Age package, with Ramtha (who is channeled by J.Z. Knight in the film) at the helm.The film includes some clever graphics, with the central character, Amanda, played by Marlee Matlin (Best Actress Oscar winner for the 1988 ""Children of a Lesser God""). The cast also includes Elaine Hendrix as her goofy and sweet friend, John Ross Bowie as Elliot, and Barry Newman as her boss.Total running time is 108 minutes.The ""B"" side of the DVD contains approximately 75 minutes of interviews with cast and filmmakers, and a very beautiful music video, by the group Aeon Spoke, of a song called ""Emmanuel.""",4,"4 stars for the questions, less for some of the answers",1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,2380,"['blend', 'fact', 'fiction', 'documentary', 'footage', 'combined', 'film', 'photographer', 'life', 'being', 'impacted', 'other', 'realities', 'What', 'Bleep', 'best', 'documentary', 'plot', 'sections', 'being', 'bit', 'labored', 'really', 'bogging', 'down', 'lengthy', 'wedding', 'sequence.Many', 'questions', 'raised', 'being', 'interviewed', 'are', 'thought', 'provoking', 'explore', 'possibilities', 'quantum', 'physics', 'brought', 'universe', 'theories', 'are', 'fascinating', 'imply', 'inner', 'world', 'outer', 'world', 'rather', 'commonly', 'thought', 'reasoning', 'are', 'creatures', 'environment', 'answers', 'range', 'excellent', 'ludicrous', 'biggest', 'red', 'flag', 'entry', 'nonsense', 'category', 'statement', 'Dr.', 'Candace', 'Pert', 'who', 'Columbus', 'ships', 'were', 'invisible', 'natives', 'had', 'never', 'encountered', 'ships', 'were', 'not', 'able', 'see', 'shaman', 'revealed', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'compare', 'size', 'dugout', 'canoes', 'used', 'natives', 'were', 'huge', 'Columbus', 'ships', 'were', 'very', 'small.As', 'psychiatrist', 'Jeffrey', 'Satinover', 'states', 'interview', 'concerning', 'reality', 'Anyone', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'explain', 'likely', 'get', 'lost', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'what', 'happen', 'including', 'many', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'responses', 'religion', 'questionable', 'theories', 'morality.The', 'good', 'part', 'film', 'meaning', 'existence', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'ask', 'who', 'am', 'what', 'am', 'doing', 'life', 'further', 'knowledge', 'quantum', 'physics', 'film', 'been', 'great', 'benefit', 'danger', 'scenario', 'Dr.', 'Pert', 'mythical', 'natives', 'shaman', 'will', 'be', 'repeated', 'wrapped', 'up', 'New', 'Age', 'package', 'Ramtha', 'who', 'channeled', 'J.Z', 'Knight', 'film', 'helm.The', 'film', 'clever', 'graphics', 'central', 'character', 'Amanda', 'played', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'winner', '1988', 'Children', 'Lesser', 'God', 'cast', 'also', 'Elaine', 'Hendrix', 'goofy', 'sweet', 'friend', 'John', 'Ross', 'Bowie', 'Elliot', 'Barry', 'Newman', 'boss.Total', 'running', 'time', '108', 'minutes.The', 'B', 'side', 'DVD', 'approximately', '75', 'minutes', 'interviews', 'cast', 'filmmakers', 'very', 'beautiful', 'music', 'video', 'group', 'Aeon', 'Spoke', 'song', 'called', 'Emmanuel']",N/A

For the past year my friends had been going on and on about how wonderful this movie is. I hesitated to see it, because, well, COME ON, it is made by supporters of a woman who claims to channel a 35,000-year-old being from Atlantis! I can't believe anyone can take that seriously.What got me to finally see this film is that I found, much to my surprise, that some of my high school friends are in it.As luck would have it, the scene with my friends is about two minutes long (the dance sequence during the wedding that Matlin attends), and the rest of the movie is just bizarre beyond belief. I actually found myself falling asleep a few times, afraid that I might miss the scene my friends are in. By the middle of the movie, I felt that it was so bad that I didn't care if I missed seeing my friends.Among the more annoying things about this film was the retelling of what common sense tells you must be a complete fabrication. One of the scientists says that when the Spanish arrived in the New World the indigenous (""Indian"") people could not see the ships -- because, supposedly, those ships were outside of the worldview of the Indians. This fallacy was then dubiously intertwined with the scientists' muddled perspectives on Quantum Physics, and then couched in Human Potential/Self-Help rhetoric to mean, ""You need to broaden your horizons. Something can be right in front of you and you can't see it because you don't recognize it.""Now, how exactly do we know that the Indians could not see those ships? Did Ramtha regress and cohabitate in an Indian body and look at the ship through the eyes of an Indian? Well, I wouldn't be surprised if she would claim she could do that. But the truth is that no source of information is given for this claim about the Indians, and it is utterly impossible to know whether the Indians could see those ships or not -- because we do not have firsthand testimony from them and we did not see, or ""not see,"" those ships through their eyes. Frankly, this concept sounds racist to me.It seems to me that the commentators took what may be a very interesting and complex sociological questions -- i.e., What constitutes ""seeing""? Do different societies react differently when new objects are introduced into their environments? Was it customary for that tribe to not interact with a new object, to let it be and observe it, to later allow the shaman to interact with it, to later claim they couldn't see it at first? -- and simplified it to fit their rinky-dink, Ramtha-proselytizing format. Indigenous tribal groups often have different views of reality and different language constructions. I've heard that some indigenous tribes have several different words for the same object. Maybe some indigenous tribes have several different definitions of what it means to ""see"" something.If you want to learn about Quantum Physics, turn to Einstein or Stephen Hawking -- not the followers of a woman who claims to channel a 35,000-year-old man from Atlantis! If you want a bizarre movie with animation sequences that insult your intelligence (some of the animation looks like Claymation), and a loosely held-together and boring story starring Marlee Matlin, then ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" is for you!

192686,A21U04RIT5AUDJ,1582704414,A Reader with Gratitude and Appreciation,"[0, 0]","Fascinating is the only word I can explain about this movie/documentary.  I had similar experience as what Amanda in the movie, though... the movie has drawn the character change of thought patterns/beliefs in a very dramatic process.  In reality, I know the breakdown of my thoughts and beliefs was very fast (well, because I was on the edge of either letting my life go permanently or to breakdown the entire thoughts and beliefs which causes the depressive moods), but it has always been the two steps forward and one step backward process.  And yes... I am diagnosed as clinically depressed.  I am so glad that finally someone is using arts and science to create this beautiful piece of documentary about how powerful our thoughts and beliefs can control our lives, our own world.This whole movie merges science and spirituality to create a new reality about what thoughts and beliefs can do to our own perceptions of reality.  The first step is we become aware of our emotions, aware of our thoughts and beliefs... This awareness is like us becoming the scientist in our mind and soul.  Only when we become conscious being aware of and accepting the existence of our both positive and destructive thoughts within ourselves, can we turn/return that energy to gentle love and compassion.  The reality described in the religions forces our mind to live in the mental prison, while the truth is that religion was supposed to be the gateway towards spiritual freedom.  The best thing is that we always thought our past is going to carry to our future... Only realize it will only be true when we are stuck in the unconscious patterns of thinking...  When we learn, when we heal from the seemingly unbearable painful experience, can we truly create a new dimension of reality, a new dimension to live.NOTES:  The only two notes are as follows:1. Open your heart and mind... even you have the tendency to pre-judgeWhen watching the movie, you might want to let the movie inspire you than pre-judging what these researchers say.  These people study the quantum physics topic for years and we can only give them the credit of their work by opening up mind and heart to listen... If you decide later what they say makes absolutely no sense or you disagree, that is ok... but please open up your mind to understand and to listen... so that you get what you pay for the DVD.2. Set realistic expectations about the change of thoughts and beliefsInner transformation (change of thoughts and beliefs) is a two step forward and one step back process.  Amanda's mind seemed to be healed so dramatically in the movie and it is not the reality.  I was put in a pretty life-threatening situation... and even with that push, it is still a two step forward one step back... one year long therapy to reach the state of mind that is more conscious than my last 24 years of life.  Having the intention, the persistence to change is a good start.  Having the commitment and constantly inviting love and compassion are the keys to explore the unlimited growth potential.I hope you will enjoy watching the movie and feel we learn something new...",5,Teaches us to be open minded and always open our heart. ..,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,3123,"['Fascinating', 'only', 'word', 'can', 'explain', 'movie/documentary', 'had', 'similar', 'experience', 'what', 'Amanda', 'movie', 'movie', 'drawn', 'character', 'change', 'thought', 'patterns/beliefs', 'very', 'dramatic', 'process', 'reality', 'know', 'breakdown', 'thoughts', 'beliefs', 'was', 'very', 'fast', 'well', 'was', 'edge', 'letting', 'life', 'go', 'permanently', 'breakdown', 'entire', 'thoughts', 'beliefs', 'depressive', 'moods', 'always', 'been', 'two', 'steps', 'forward', 'one', 'step', 'backward', 'process', 'yes', 'am', 'diagnosed', 'clinically', 'depressed', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'finally', 'someone', 'using', 'arts', 'science', 'create', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'documentary', 'how', 'powerful', 'thoughts', 'beliefs', 'can', 'control', 'lives', 'own', 'world.This', 'whole', 'movie', 'merges', 'science', 'spirituality', 'create', 'new', 'reality', 'what', 'thoughts', 'beliefs', 'can', 'do', 'own', 'perceptions', 'reality', 'first', 'step', 'become', 'aware', 'emotions', 'aware', 'thoughts', 'beliefs', 'awareness', 'becoming', 'scientist', 'mind', 'soul', 'Only', 'when', 'become', 'conscious', 'being', 'aware', 'accepting', 'existence', 'positive', 'destructive', 'thoughts', 'can', 'turn/return', 'energy', 'gentle', 'love', 'compassion', 'reality', 'described', 'religions', 'mind', 'live', 'mental', 'prison', 'truth', 'religion', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'gateway', 'spiritual', 'freedom', 'best', 'thing', 'always', 'thought', 'past', 'going', 'carry', 'future', 'Only', 'realize', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'true', 'when', 'are', 'stuck', 'unconscious', 'patterns', 'thinking', 'When', 'learn', 'when', 'heal', 'seemingly', 'unbearable', 'painful', 'experience', 'can', 'truly', 'create', 'new', 'dimension', 'reality', 'new', 'dimension', 'live.NOTES', 'only', 'two', 'notes', 'are', 'follows:1', 'Open', 'heart', 'mind', 'even', 'have', 'tendency', 'pre-judgeWhen', 'watching', 'movie', 'might', 'want', 'let', 'movie', 'inspire', 'pre-judging', 'what', 'researchers', 'say', 'people', 'study', 'quantum', 'physics', 'topic', 'years', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'credit', 'work', 'opening', 'up', 'mind', 'heart', 'listen', 'decide', 'later', 'what', 'say', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'disagree', 'ok', 'please', 'open', 'up', 'mind', 'understand', 'listen', 'so', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'DVD.2', 'Set', 'realistic', 'expectations', 'change', 'thoughts', 'beliefsInner', 'transformation', 'change', 'thoughts', 'beliefs', 'two', 'step', 'forward', 'one', 'step', 'back', 'process', 'Amanda', 'mind', 'seemed', 'be', 'healed', 'so', 'dramatically', 'movie', 'not', 'reality', 'was', 'put', 'pretty', 'life-threatening', 'situation', 'even', 'push', 'still', 'two', 'step', 'forward', 'one', 'step', 'back', 'one', 'year', 'long', 'therapy', 'reach', 'state', 'mind', 'more', 'conscious', 'last', '24', 'years', 'life', 'Having', 'intention', 'persistence', 'change', 'good', 'start', 'Having', 'commitment', 'constantly', 'inviting', 'love', 'compassion', 'are', 'keys', 'explore', 'unlimited', 'growth', 'hope', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'feel', 'learn', 'something', 'new']",N/A

All the quantum fluxuations, strangeness, and weird predictions average out to make our universe one that obeys the more organized kinematics of Newton and Einstein.  In other words, the universe is a quantum mechanical one, but at normal scales of time and distance, it acts like a classical mechanical one.  The statistical nature of quantum mechanics averages out to leave us with ordinariness.What this means is that the precise claims that this ridiculous movie makes cannot be measured or observed by any methodology at the scales involved.  In general, one cannot influence quantum effects with non-quantum forces.  If that were not true we would see large scale quantum mechanical effects all over the place.  We don't see baseballs tunnelling through baseball bats.This whole movie is garbage of the worst kind.  Its claims have long since been completely falsified by the very quantum principles that any undergraduate physics student knows well.

The fictional storyline follows the Deaf Lady and interspersed between her scenes are interviews with psychopathic hippies babbling about their hippie bullcrap beliefs.The Deaf Lady is a raging alcoholic who during the course of the film is unbelievably mean to her best friend, gets schooled in basketball by some eleven year old homeboy, gets drunk at a wedding and c**kteases every dude there.  In between all these scenes are the profoundly insane interviews with the so-called ""experts"".  Now, keep in mind that these people haven't bathed, brushed their teeth with anything other than dirt and tree bark, or gotten a haircut in well over ten years.  We're talking Ted Kaczynski-crazy here.

Well, where do I start...Just in case the ridiculous title wasn't enough to turn you off from the get go, the next two hours of your life will be filled with a tedious and mind numbing grade school approach to philosophy, quantum physics, and how people's attitudes and beliefs ultimately affect how their lives will unfold. If you're even looking at the ""What the bl33p..."" page here at Amazon and reading these reviews, you must have a certain degree of intelligence going for you to make you curious at all about such things. But at the same time, you should also appreciate those very same intellectual aspirations which moved you to seek out a higher understanding and instead indulge them with a little reading. Or meditation. Or clipping your toenails. Just do something, but don't try to quench your thirst for knowledge by watching this movie.What the film fails to do is establish an interesting story or protagonist, so when it senses itself becoming weak, it falls back upon a myriad of mystical quantum physicists, whose interviews, by the way, feel as if they should be floating around in some sort of educational film reel rather than a feature-length movie. And that would be fine. IF the film had kept to that formula instead of trying to tack on an unnecessary and annoying narrative that's roughly in the same vein as oh, let's just say a really well-produced after school special.Right from the start, we are given a deaf woman who has unnecessary flashbacks of her ex-husband's infidelity. So we have a handicapped person who has ALSO previously been cuckolded? Oh, God, the pity points are just stacking up! Isn't it just killing you! That certainly is the correct formula for a good main character; make them pathetic so that if the audience doesn't like them, they get to feel bad! That's totally not an underhanded approach or anything.In addition, as if we weren't smart enough to pick up on insultingly blatant metaphors, there's a little African-American kid playing basketball to play the obligatory part of the ""white rabbit"". (Get it?? Basketballs go down a hoop?? Sort of like a RABBIT HOLE?? HUH? HUH? Yeahhhh!) He's chipper and grating as he explains complex logical loopholes with all of the chubby cheeked enthusiasm of a kid who has landed his first acting role on a commercial about paper towels.Don't get me wrong-- the philosophies presented in the interview portions of the film are interesting enough, provided that you can swallow a fair amount of mystical bull crap without gagging, but they're ultimately too watered down to even come close to approaching the depths they sought to reach in the first place. It's just too mainstream an approach for something as complex as quantum physics, and while I think the filmmakers had good intentions in trying to enlighten the masses by presenting something like that in an entertaining way, I just found it rather cloying. Dare I say ""cheesy"".If it wanted to be a story, it should have tried to be a story. If it wanted to be an educational film, it could have made a great one. But it wants it both ways, and the result is a big, sloppy insult to the audience's intelligence. The box claims that ""moviegoers are enthralled!"" and yet I find myself wanting to reject philosophy entirely if it would mean becoming some kind of pretentious, new-age zombie.

In its presentation of science-meets-psychedelia-meets-gnosticism, ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" portrays a late modern (bourgeois) liberalism at the height of its discontent, seeking parallel universes to fly to in order to escape the emotional and physical difficulties of the present moment.  The point of this flight is for humanity to reach its fullest potential: the liberal longing for ""ultimate freedom"".So what exactly is the point of the movie?  Its non-stop barrage of scientific and New Age discussions amid psychedelic effects and computer animations will likely stir discussion among watchers; ""what IS reality?"" is a question that you are likely to hear or, perhaps, even ask.  The premise of the movie, ""everything is not as it seems"", is the premise of every great philosophy and religion, as well as those that fall far short of greatness.  After surveying a certain range of options (limited, to say the least) - quantum physics (""the science of probability""), New Age spirituality and positive thinking - we reach the movie's end.Ironically, by arguing against certain conceptions of ""the real"" and making a certain strand of science (from the Latin ""scientia"", meaning ""having knowledge"") the lens that we are to see by, we are left in exactly same spot we started from: appearance is still reality!  The issue is what hermeneutic we use to uncover these layers; those ""in the know"", possessing this scientia/gnosis, will see that what things are isn't really what things are, and therefore see them as they really are!  Advocating the superiority of this new position necessitates putting words into other's mouths, making their viewpoint sound inferior, which only serves to validate this new point of view (which happens at the end of the movie against some very childish understandings of religion).""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" advocates a postmodern, New Age quantum physics as the really real by which we judge everything else.  Hence, we have the basis of a worldview founded on what we...don't know.  Perhaps our collective not knowing is the reason for the constant recourse throughout the movie the quantum physics.  Not knowing necessitates a faith in probability - a faith in faith which we can have faith in..., so to speak.But what is probability other than an attempt to do something with - an attempt to do something in the space of - an actual absence?  By making a wager on probability, we find ourselves with an unending distance between the space which we occupy and the space which the Real occupies.  What we are left experiencing is the negative infinity of calculus: ever receding and ever progressing, but never finally absent or fully present.  By putting everything in the realm of the probable, we put everything in flux.  Thus, the question is whether or not an ""everything is flux"" view - as ancient as the Sophists, to say the least - can really sustain the development of human potential once the flux the ever-present-but-momentary probabile has long since passed.  In the end, I don't think it can.Thus, the close of the movie - Ramtha's statement that ""You are God"" - comes across as little more than laughable.  An increasingly fragmented society founded upon the individualized individual may very well hear this statement as the sine qua non of freedom, but it utterly precludes communication: the ""God"" that you are means nothing because it cannot be understood within a frame of reference that you and your neighbor share.  The absence of this shared level of understanding over a concept such as ""God"" (which, in this movie, still represents something beyond where we are even if it is who we are) will only prevent progress as no one knows who/what/where/when... the God that we are progressing to really *is*.Perhaps what we are best left with at the movie's end is the idea that reality is...probable.",1,Digitized Gnosticism,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,3996,"['Anyone', 'wondering', 'how', 'Democrats', 'lost', '2004', 'Presidential', 'election', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'watch', 'movie', 'everything', 'presentation', 'science-meets-psychedelia-meets-gnosticism', 'What', 'Bleep', 'Do', 'Know', 'late', 'modern', 'bourgeois', 'liberalism', 'height', 'discontent', 'seeking', 'parallel', 'universes', 'fly', 'order', 'escape', 'emotional', 'physical', 'difficulties', 'present', 'moment', 'point', 'flight', 'humanity', 'reach', 'fullest', 'potential', 'liberal', 'longing', 'ultimate', 'freedom', 'what', 'exactly', 'point', 'movie', 'non-stop', 'barrage', 'scientific', 'New', 'Age', 'discussions', 'psychedelic', 'effects', 'computer', 'animations', 'will', 'likely', 'stir', 'discussion', 'watchers', 'what', 'reality', 'question', 'are', 'likely', 'hear', 'perhaps', 'even', 'ask', 'premise', 'movie', 'everything', 'not', 'premise', 'great', 'philosophy', 'religion', 'as', 'well', 'fall', 'far', 'short', 'greatness', 'surveying', 'certain', 'range', 'options', 'limited', 'say', 'least', 'quantum', 'physics', 'science', 'probability', 'New', 'Age', 'spirituality', 'positive', 'thinking', 'reach', 'movie', 'end.Ironically', 'arguing', 'certain', 'conceptions', 'real', 'making', 'certain', 'strand', 'science', 'Latin', 'scientia', 'meaning', 'having', 'knowledge', 'lens', 'are', 'see', 'are', 'left', 'exactly', 'same', 'spot', 'started', 'appearance', 'still', 'reality', 'issue', 'what', 'hermeneutic', 'use', 'uncover', 'layers', 'know', 'possessing', 'scientia/gnosis', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'what', 'things', 'are', 'therefore', 'see', 'really', 'are', 'Advocating', 'superiority', 'new', 'position', 'necessitates', 'putting', 'words', 'other', 'mouths', 'making', 'viewpoint', 'sound', 'inferior', 'only', 'validate', 'new', 'point', 'view', 'end', 'movie', 'very', 'childish', 'understandings', 'religion', 'What', 'Bleep', 'Do', 'Know', 'postmodern', 'New', 'Age', 'quantum', 'physics', 'really', 'real', 'judge', 'everything', 'else', 'Hence', 'have', 'basis', 'worldview', 'founded', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Perhaps', 'collective', 'not', 'knowing', 'reason', 'constant', 'recourse', 'movie', 'quantum', 'physics', 'Not', 'knowing', 'faith', 'probability', 'faith', 'faith', 'can', 'have', 'faith', 'so', 'speak.But', 'what', 'probability', 'other', 'attempt', 'do', 'something', 'attempt', 'do', 'something', 'space', 'actual', 'absence', 'making', 'wager', 'probability', 'find', 'unending', 'distance', 'space', 'occupy', 'space', 'Real', 'occupies', 'What', 'are', 'left', 'experiencing', 'negative', 'infinity', 'calculus', 'ever', 'receding', 'ever', 'progressing', 'never', 'finally', 'absent', 'fully', 'present', 'putting', 'everything', 'realm', 'probable', 'put', 'everything', 'flux', 'Thus', 'question', 'not', 'everything', 'flux', 'view', 'as', 'ancient', 'Sophists', 'say', 'least', 'can', 'really', 'sustain', 'development', 'human', 'potential', 'flux', 'ever-present-but-momentary', 'probabile', 'long', 'passed', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can.Thus', 'close', 'movie', 'Ramtha', 'statement', 'are', 'God', 'little', 'more', 'laughable', 'increasingly', 'fragmented', 'society', 'founded', 'individualized', 'individual', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'hear', 'statement', 'sine', 'qua', 'non', 'freedom', 'utterly', 'communication', 'God', 'are', 'nothing', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'understood', 'frame', 'reference', 'neighbor', 'share', 'absence', 'shared', 'level', 'understanding', 'concept', 'such', 'God', 'movie', 'still', 'something', 'where', 'are', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'will', 'only', 'prevent', 'progress', 'one', 'who/what/where/when', 'God', 'are', 'progressing', 'really', '*is*.Perhaps', 'what', 'are', 'best', 'left', 'movie', 'end', 'idea', 'reality', 'probable']",N/A

(I'm sure that in spite of my Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics, I'm just being close-minded and all that).First it completely misapplies the idea of quantum mechanics (e.g. uncertainty, superposition, etc.)  These effects occur at the atomic level and below.  Even as the so-called ""observer"", you do not get to change the macroscopic world by simply seeing the universe as you'd like it to be.  Reality is still reality, even if our perceptions of it are incorrect.  I don't know if the ideas of cellular structure and brain chemistry are presented in an equally incorrect way, but I would suspect so...  based on the things that I do know, and how they treated that.They do no better with history.  I don't know how they could possibly get the idea that the Peruvian Indians literally could not see the Spanish ships on the horizon when they arrived in the Americas (ostensibly because it was not a part of their reality)...  nor can I find any such story from a credible source after the fact.  I've read that they percieved the ships to be raven gods and whatnot, but they sure SAW something in all the accounts I've heard.And water molecules that change their emotions due to what's written on a piece of tape stuck to their container?  Puh-lease!  Even if we grant that a molecule is somehow capable of emotion and empathic communication with humans, why would something that's been traveling the planet for the last 4 billion year give a damn about my opinion of it?Sagan at least tried to keep his facts reasonably straight, and didn't try to degrade the sciences into a new mysticism.  The universe is a beautiful and complicated place.  Theres no need to embellish on the way it works.

Or like, ""We just don't know nothing do we""--anything really, without that bleep. That bleep doesn't help things. But, then again, there is this forceful geekiness to this whole project, it is just so uncool in so many ways, kind of like seeing your parents try to wear low-cut designer jeans, that it almost becomes appealing, because how could anything truly evil and cultish really come off so silly?As entertainment, this film scores points with me because it is just so astoundingly weird. It has created a new genre, as far as I am concerned: New Age Camp. Because that is exactly what it is. These awkward plotlines, the badly animated sequences involving amino acids, and cells that look like gummy bears, as if Fellini had directed some sort of acid-tinged toothpaste commercial, that kid with his basketballs that kind of has you wishing you really could cross over into a parallel universe just so you can kick him in the head, Marlee Matlin scowling at everyone, bowing under the weight of her oversized camera, and yes, JZ Knight, a woman who claims to be channeling a 35,000 year old sage...I mean, how could you NOT LIKE THIS?!!? It's AMAZING!Now, look. I'm no dummy. I am sure this movie was indeed financed and created by members of a cult (The Ramtha School of Enlightenment, applications now being accepted!) but who cares really. What it has to say may not lack a shred of empirical evidence, but there's something so innocent about it, so fascinating in its use or misuse of of scientific ideas and theories, that I would say even to the most downtrodden cynic, that this film is worth checking out. And hey, if the concepts being bandied about mean something to you, then I feel that is valid, and if they don't, that too is also valid. I think it depends on the person.The film is a pseudo-documentary that crosses Quantum Mechanics with some New Age theories in order to demonstrate that we may not fully realize our own reality. It isn't entirely successful in this respect, but then again, it can't be so easily dismissed either, and doesn't deserve some of the vitriol it's been getting on this site. There is also a sort-of-plot that wraps around these theories, that is meant to demonstrate the discission by showing an unhappy woman's cathartic realizations about herself and her reality. The core of her unfulfilled existence, really. This woman is played by Marlee Matlin, perhaps the first woman in cinema to use physics in order to feel better about her thighs.There are various scientists interviewed who speak about how one can control one's destiny through the power of thought. In the end, you may be somewhat disappointed by the identities of some of these ""experts"", but then again, I think one is meant to detatch as much as possible, and absorb on a visceral level. That is why, I think, their resumes are reserved for the end credits. Once again, if these ideas affect you, then that's valid I think.The power of positive thinking... An interesting idea, very popular in the Self-Help section of bookstores, but to inject all that with Quantum Theory, is at once both sort of insane, and kind of beautiful. I mean, just try it...Right? Has anyone who has lambasted this movie ever just tried to use some of these ideas in their day-to-day lives and see if it made a difference for them? Maybe it will. Maybe it can. I don't know! But the movie isn't asking for anything more than that (it's not even asking for that) nor does it disguise itself as something it's not. A lot of reviewers seem to imply that, but I disagree, I think it's all about how you, individually, see this movie.For instance, the bit about the Water Crystals, and how emotional words affect the shape of water. And, therefore, ""if thoughts can do that to water, imagine what thoughts could do to each one of us.""  Now, maybe the movie implies rather strongly that this is a crucial scientific breakthrough. In actuality, Masaru Emoto's work was created as ART, and was never entered into a scientific journal. It was also not a ""double blind"" experiment; that is, Emoto provided the specimen as well as received the sample for analysis, providing what is known, apparently, as ""confirmation bias""--so in effect, it's not a true scientific experiment. It may be presented as such, however you look at it, but the film wants you to absorb these ideas within themselves, and not necessarily seek to prove or disprove them. So in that sense, does it really matter if it's art or science...maybe words can really affect water, and if they can, that's really cool, and what does that mean for us and our consciousness...The film is shot on location in Portland, Oregon, which looks dreamy and sleepy, and was one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, since I am not familiar with the Pacific Northwest, and didn't know what city all this lunacy was taking place in. I say that lovingly. On a final note, I have discovered an online, up-to-the-minute, self-edited encyclopedia, Wikipedia.org, that for some reason people don't seem to know about.

What you find out may or may not surprise you.I didn't check deeply enough, and regret the money I spent on buying this DVD. I watched only one side of the three double-sided discs (the original theatrical version) and then filed it away under ""DVDs to be pawned off at my local record/video shop"". I will not watch the other five sides of the discs, and that is something very unusual for me as a regular Amazon buyer.Don't get me wrong: Marlee Matlin does a decent job of holding up the ""drama"" side of the film and there is lots of humor, intriguing testimony and amazing graphics in the ""documentary"" side of ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"". But after watching this movie just one time, the word FISHY kept coming up in my mind. I went on the Internet and did some searching, and found out why.What the filmmakers of ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" do not tell you in the film's trailer and in the film itself is that they, the filmmakers, as well as some of the interviewees, are affiliated with the mega-million-dollar organization founded by JZ Knight, famous for her channeling of a 35,000-year-old spirit named Ramtha. Her organization is based in the rural city of Yelm, Washington state -- the same city where ""What the Bleep"" was first premiered and where the producers of the film are reported to be based.What the filmmakers also don't tell you (but which you will find out if you check around on the Internet) is that one of the credible sources in the film has completely denounced ""What the Bleep"" and the way his interview was misrepresented to promote the film's premise. The filmmakers also will not tell you that there are a number of people (including Knight's late ex-husband) who have left her organization and called it little more than a cult in New Age clothing. This is distressing.Spirituality is one thing, but deceit is quite another. We all want more spirituality in our lives. But we need to be cautious and selective about this because there are just as many so-called New Age organizations out there that will take our money as quickly as some mainstream Christian churches will.Which is exactly why I give this film the same low rating of ""1"" that I gave to the DVD ""George W. Bush: Faith in the White House"". If there is one thing worse than being conned by a bunch of true-believing, right-wing Christian fundamentalists, it is being duped by a group of true-believing New Agers who align themselves with left-wing causes (see ""What the Bleep's"" website store for examples). I would give both the Bush and Bleep DVDs a rating of zero if I could.To be fair, JZ Knight and Ramtha are given only a few cameo appearances in this film. But those appearances are just enough to weave their way into the scientific dialogue and dramatic acting scenes to give Knight, the millionaire spirit-channeler, some much-needed credibility in the movie. Plus, hers is the only ""non-expert"" interview featured in the film, making you wonder why she's even in this movie in the first place. Again, the filmmakers make no mention whatsoever in the film of their connections to Knight and her organization.But the good news is that spiritually hungry people everywhere are waking up and smelling the coffee. Using their brains, people are increasingly coming to tell the difference between true, dedicated people of spirit, like the Dalai Lama of Tibet, and fishy facsimiles. Buyers in the New Age marketplace are not the only ones who should beware -- channeled spirits also have to be on guard for the growing numbers of human beings who are thinking more deeply before spending their hard-earned money on movies like this.If you must buy this DVD, then at least first spend some time on the Internet checking out this film's background. If you decide to buy it after that, well, it is up to you. At least consider yourself a forewarned (and wiser) consumer for having read this.Enough said. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to shut down my computer and go out for a long, quiet walk in nature -- where I'm more likely to encounter Spirit in its purest form than I would in this film.",1,Buyers (and Channeled Spirits) Beware!,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,4270,"['Amazon', 'buyers', 'who', 'are', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'are', 'strongly', 'encouraged', 'first', 'go', 'do', 'checking', 'Internet', 'movie', 'background', 'What', 'find', 'out', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'surprise', 'you.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'deeply', 'enough', 'regret', 'money', 'spent', 'buying', 'DVD', 'watched', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'three', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'then', 'filed', 'away', 'DVDs', 'be', 'pawned', 'off', 'local', 'record/video', 'shop', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'other', 'five', 'sides', 'discs', 'something', 'very', 'unusual', 'regular', 'Amazon', 'buyer.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'decent', 'job', 'holding', 'up', 'drama', 'side', 'film', 'lots', 'humor', 'intriguing', 'testimony', 'amazing', 'graphics', 'documentary', 'side', 'What', 'Bleep', 'Do', 'Know', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'time', 'word', 'FISHY', 'kept', 'coming', 'up', 'mind', 'went', 'Internet', 'did', 'searching', 'found', 'out', 'filmmakers', 'What', 'Bleep', 'Do', 'Know', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'film', 'trailer', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'as', 'well', 'interviewees', 'are', 'affiliated', 'mega-million-dollar', 'organization', 'founded', 'JZ', 'Knight', 'famous', 'channeling', '35,000-year-old', 'spirit', 'named', 'Ramtha', 'organization', 'based', 'rural', 'city', 'Yelm', 'Washington', 'state', 'same', 'city', 'where', 'What', 'Bleep', 'was', 'first', 'premiered', 'where', 'producers', 'film', 'are', 'reported', 'be', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'check', 'around', 'Internet', 'one', 'credible', 'sources', 'film', 'completely', 'denounced', 'What', 'Bleep', 'way', 'interview', 'was', 'misrepresented', 'promote', 'film', 'premise', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'are', 'number', 'people', 'including', 'Knight', 'late', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'have', 'left', 'organization', 'called', 'more', 'cult', 'New', 'Age', 'clothing', 'distressing.Spirituality', 'one', 'thing', 'deceit', 'quite', 'want', 'more', 'spirituality', 'lives', 'need', 'be', 'cautious', 'selective', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'so-called', 'New', 'Age', 'out', 'there', 'will', 'take', 'money', 'as', 'quickly', 'mainstream', 'Christian', 'churches', 'will.Which', 'exactly', 'why', 'give', 'film', 'same', 'low', 'rating', '1', 'gave', 'DVD', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'Faith', 'White', 'House', 'one', 'thing', 'worse', 'being', 'conned', 'bunch', 'true-believing', 'right-wing', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'being', 'duped', 'group', 'true-believing', 'New', 'Agers', 'who', 'align', 'left-wing', 'causes', 'see', 'What', 'Bleep', 'website', 'store', 'examples', 'would', 'give', 'Bush', 'Bleep', 'DVDs', 'rating', 'zero', 'could.To', 'be', 'fair', 'JZ', 'Knight', 'Ramtha', 'are', 'given', 'only', 'few', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'film', 'appearances', 'are', 'just', 'enough', 'weave', 'way', 'scientific', 'dialogue', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'scenes', 'give', 'Knight', 'millionaire', 'spirit-channeler', 'much-needed', 'credibility', 'movie', 'hers', 'only', 'non-expert', 'interview', 'featured', 'film', 'making', 'wonder', 'why', 'even', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'Again', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'mention', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'connections', 'Knight', 'organization.But', 'good', 'news', 'spiritually', 'hungry', 'people', 'everywhere', 'are', 'waking', 'up', 'smelling', 'coffee', 'Using', 'brains', 'people', 'are', 'increasingly', 'coming', 'tell', 'difference', 'true', 'dedicated', 'people', 'spirit', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'Tibet', 'fishy', 'facsimiles', 'Buyers', 'New', 'Age', 'marketplace', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'should', 'beware', 'channeled', 'spirits', 'also', 'have', 'be', 'guard', 'growing', 'numbers', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'thinking', 'more', 'deeply', 'spending', 'hard-earned', 'money', 'movies', 'this.If', 'must', 'buy', 'DVD', 'then', 'least', 'first', 'spend', 'time', 'Internet', 'checking', 'out', 'film', 'background', 'decide', 'buy', 'well', 'up', 'least', 'consider', 'forewarned', 'wiser', 'consumer', 'having', 'read', 'this.Enough', 'said', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'excuse', ""'m"", 'going', 'shut', 'down', 'computer', 'go', 'out', 'long', 'quiet', 'walk', 'nature', 'where', ""'m"", 'more', 'likely', 'encounter', 'Spirit', 'purest', 'form', 'would', 'film']",N/A

The movie also mixes in animation and graphics. At one point it turns into a musical, including a performance of Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to love"" by a ...cell (I kid you not!).Humor was also used, although a bit controversial at times, it worked. The movie was viewer-friendly, although in some cases they were compressing too much content into long sentences, which works when reading a book/paper, but when listening to it, it forces bird-brains like me to listen to the long-winded sentences 2-3 times to get it :-)The majority of the talking heads had impressive lines in their resumes, such as PhD/MD degrees, some of them from (or currently at) places like Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, etc. Only one of them was self-described  ""master of enlightment"" - Ramtha, no scientific/scholastic credentials presented. I am not familiar with all these people, so I don't know how their work/research is perceived by their peers and the general public. It should be noted that each of the talking heads has their own ideas, and they do not all agree on everything, so even if you consider ""Ramtha"" to be too ""out there"" or New Agey, it shouldn't necessarily discredit what the other people are saying.Some of the material presented passed the test of common sense. A couple of things seemed to me a bit ""too convenient"" such as the ability to design your day, but being surprised by the actual events that shape your day and lead you to your day's goals (randomness and preparation can also do the same thing). A number of the things presented were counter to ""everyday reality"", which is where quantum physics lives.The majority of what was said was based on quantum physics. Given the uncertain nature of quantum physics, there are enough holes in it for most of the material presented to be true, but just because they are possible and there is no way to prove/disprove them right now, it doesn't necessarily make them facts or ""reality"".I am by no means an expert on this topic, so I will reserve judgment until after I read more on these topics...

What, exactly, is reality?I'll warn you, I get a little hocus-pocus-y with this review... so you may want to turn back now...I've been reading and gaining and interest in Buddist principles and Zen and all that stuff lately so this film was timely for me. I didn't realize that there is a very big debate going on about this film. I see both sides of the coin, but won't bore you with that stuff - I think you get what you put into something and obviously both sides have their agendas... on the film, as it is...I think it tackled some pretty heavy duty questions and thoughts. The basis behind the film is Quantum Physics (yeah, I see you all running for the hill now - there won't be a test afterwards). It does do a great job of explaining Quantum Physics and what the principles are and how they relate to the world around us. In short, we create our own reality and can have a profound affect on the reality of others around us. I'm not a spiritual or religious person, but I do believe that what we put into the world, whether it's positive/negative energy or extra garbage for the landfills. I guess this is why Buddism interests me so much.I thought the water thing was very interesting, just putting negative or positive thoughts onto water can affect it's makeup (yes, I have read articles stating that the study wasn't scientific), but it was an interesting thing to ponder. I mean, if we can have that type of affect on something, then what does all the negativity in the world do?I also found the Washington DC thing interesting - again for the same reasons as above.Their take on religion was also interesting, but I won't go into that here... no reason to have everyone throwing stuff at me.I will say that the first 20 minutes of this film are pretty dry... a lot of experts/talking heads, but if you hang in with it, it's one of those movies that will leave you thinking for quite sometime!

The sub-atomic level of existence, when observed, does not follow the determined laws of Newtonian physics, that is to say, cause and effect, notions of forward time continuums, and the rules of motion. In fact, scientists have observed particles, electrons, even the nucleus of the atom, disappear and reappear for no apparent reason. Even further to this, these so-called particles of matter also appear to have ""consciousness"", as they react to being observed under certain laboratory conditions. Known in quantum physics as the ""non-locality"" theory, a sub-atomic particle seems to know what the others are doing - this discovery has opened the door to a whole new world of our conceptions of reality: are we the creators of reality or mere pedestrians of an ""already-made-world""?The film raises some very provocative questions. One of which is the fact that we have been conditioned to view the world in a certain way. There is only so much information that our brains can process over a period of time. The vast majority of our knowledge of the world depends largely on our experience. In other words, if we have not experienced a particular phenomenon, chances are it can exist right before our eyes, and we will not perceive it.A good example the film provides is the native Indians of the Caribbean. When Columbus arrived in the 13th century upon the shores of the new world, the natives, because they had never witnessed anything like it in their reality, could not see the ships on the water! An Indian Shaman observed the ripples on the water indicating some kind of disturbance, but he still could not see anything on the water. Determined to do so, he walked to the beach every day until he finally could see Columbus' sailing vessels floating off the shore. It was only after forcing his fellow natives to ""see"" and to trust his judgement that they too could see the ships. What does this story tell us about consciousness and so-called reality?  We really can only perceive those things in our environment that has been experienced or processed in our brains. This begs the question: do we create our own reality? Is there phenomenon or another reality existing right before our eyes that we just cannot see? As the film asks, how far are you willing to go down the rabbit hole?Teaching science has now grown into an art form, where complex theories can be conveyed in an entertaining manner, making the learning experience easy and fun. This film attempted to present quantum theory, cognitive theory, epistemology and neurology, combining to give the viewer a different perspective of the world.

The surprise came from the fact that she is far more wont to New Agey beliefs than either of us. The film was called What the #$*! Do We Know? After seeing it I understand why my mother-in-law was interested in this `physics film'- because it's not about physics.  Instead, it's a propaganda film put out by a cult headed by a bovine blond woman named JZ Knight, who's claimed for decades that she channels the spirit of a 35,000 year old warrior from Atlantis named Ramtha. Yet, it's not even a clever little film as propaganda, because it's so poorly edited, atrociously acted, and inanely backdropped against a dozen or so talking heads of the sort that usually delineate documentaries. Except, there's a difference. These talking heads go uncredited until the end of the film because they are all charlatans and quacks. The film also had three directors- William Arntz, Betsy Chasse, and Mark Vicente- who just happen to be Ramtha cultists. Worse, the film's a mess- all that spiritualism and not a dram of creativity? This is not like New York Stories where three great directors- Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese- did three small films that were independent. This film is tripartite, but interspersed like water, oil, and- oh- New Age bilge. It's part faux documentary, part lame Junior High/Industrial film, part psychedelic cartoon.

Do We Know?"" is a new kind of spiritual film, which fuses a documentary montage style with the unfolding of a dramatic story and amazing animation.  BLEEP takes the viewer on a thrilling tour of the boundaries of what we know, while introducing us to some of the newest concepts in the field of consciousness. Is it possible that words and ideas can change the very quality of physical matter? Do we really have an infinite range of choices available to us at any given moment? Is it possible that there are things right in front of us that are invisible to us until other people start to see them? BLEEP raises these questions and many more, and provides scintillating answers that raise even more intriguing questions. Indeed, the best way for us to learn what is really going on is to ask better questions... and watching ""What the #$*! Do We Know?"" is one of the best ways to start asking better questions.""What the #$*! Do We Know?""  tells the story of Amanda, played by Oscar-winning actress Marlee Matlin, who feels like her whole world as she knew it is coming undone, to be replaced by something strange, unknown, and new. Amanda's attitudes and assumptions expand dramatically through extraordinary dreams and remarkable encounters in waking life. Interwoven in the story of Amanda's awakening to fuller realization are documentary clips with fourteen mystics and scientists. These interviews provide a delightful counterpoint to what is happening to Amanda as she considers how she is more in charge of her life and better connected to everyone and everything else than she previously would have believed. When Amanda is given a photographic assignment that requires her to face painful memories from her past, she discovers new ways to view her experiences and a bigger sense of herself that allows her to gain strength, courage and inspiration at a time when she might otherwise have felt sad, small, and defeated. Amanda brings us on our own journey of self-discovery, as we wonder how we might reframe painful memories into life stories that reflect our more heroic, loving nature.""What the #$*! Do We Know?"" brings about positive life changes for viewers, because it presents a framework for how to reclaim mental, physical and spiritual health even in the most difficult times.

I was looking forward to a big summary of the latest findings of quantum physics as relating to alternate universes and the nature of our reality. What I got was a routine New Age snow job. When New Agers refer to science to justify their ideas, there is a fundamental misconception they love to use. They take the uncertainties of quantum physics on a subatomic level, with it's well known interaction of the observer and the particle observed, and apply it to our macroscopic world. Just as the observer affects the subatomic particle being observed, so can we affect the macroscopic world around us by the way we observe it and believe it to be. NO!!! The physics principles of the subatomic world DO NOT apply to our macroscopic world. But the New Agers love to delude themselves and us into thinking they do. Thus, the premise of this movie falls apart.There is another angle this movie takes. It points out how our perception of the world around us depends on our physical perception mechanisms, the physical wiring of our brains' synapses and our brain chemistry. They seem to imply that alterations in any of those things alter the reality around us. NO!!! They present these brain facts as if they're profound new revelations, but this is very old material to people in the scientific, medical and psychological world. Only the people in the uninformed general public are blown away by this stuff.This movie does seem to have it's own agenda. I trust you've already heard about its close connection to J. Z. Knight and her Ramtha. Other reviewers have dealt with this connection well. Read their reviews.This movie will appeal to people whose brain wiring innately craves an alternative to our present rotten reality, and who crave much more power over our reality than they currently have. I can't blame them. But the sad fact is, it WON'T happen! You can't mix the subatomic and macroscopic worlds.

192727,A2GYX971VETQBV,1582704414,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[29, 37]","WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW? is an entertaining film to watch; visually, it's quite colorful and it is sort of like watching an interesting PowerPoint presentation.  However, as far as content is concerned, it is entertaining in the same way that watching televangelists is entertaining.  One can imagine throngs of followers bowing down to the spirit of this film and paying great sums of money to participate in the reality that this film creates.  Indeed, one of the film's primary speakers is JZ Knight, the famous mystic, who claims to channel Ramtha, a 35,000 year old spirit-warrior.  Oh!  I almost forgot: Ramtha is also supposedly from Atlantis.  What's the problem?  Beyond the fact that it's complete bunk, she has copyrighted Ramtha and has made millions of dollars speaking at seminars ($1000 a pop), teaching, and from her books and tapes.But it is not just ""Ramtha's"" presence in the film that put me off as a viewer.  During the film's 90 minutes, a variety of mystical & quasi-spiritual theories are advanced under the guise of science and fact.  While much of the science in the film is accurate, it is the ""interpretation"" of that science that I found incredibly misleading.  For example, it is true that Quantum physics is the science of possibilities.  On a subatomic level, it is true that particles behave in peculiar ways and that we are grappling to understand the uncertainty and probability that seems to infuse our world.  But WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW? takes this fact about the subatomic level and brings it out to a macroscopic level.  Suddenly, my life and the world around me is a world of possibilities.  By thinking ""real hard,"" I can effectively change my life and my reality.While I believe that our attitudes and mental states can have a powerful impact on our perception of the world, I do not believe this constitutes changing our ""reality.""  I'd like these ""scientists"" to preach their message to the disabled or the mentally challenged.  I'm not so sure that ""thinking real hard"" is going to change their reality.  Sure, it may help them put a positive spin on their condition.  But it's not going to make anyone get up out of the chair.To hear this movie described as ""one of the most important films of all time"" just hurts my brain.  I would only recommend watching it if you are already into occult practices and extreme ""new-age"" thinking.  While I am not completely closed-minded on these topics, I believe that the conclusions drawn by WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW? are unjustified given the scientific evidence that we have.  Thus, using science to ""justify"" these conclusions is misleading and unconscionable.  Of course, there are those that will claim that the film is just meant for entertainment and that we should not take it so seriously.  Very well.

Bleep! opened the cultural door to a number of other films, chief amongst them ""The Secret"" which is presently skyrocketing to underground success on the internet (and as of this writing not available on amazon - one has to go to the film website to view or purchase it).When I first viewed Bleep!,I had a broad smile, and in the very fashion the film would have us adopt, had a flashback to five years ago.... excuse this review lapsing into a memoir; you see the story illustrates the very points made in the movie.In 2001 I met Fred Alan Wolf over at Deepak Chopra's in La Jolla.  I was in a small group of people who had been invited to hear him talk about his latest book: Mind into Matter.  Dr Wolf was fascinating. His concepts made my head spin. I had never before been told about the notion that thoughts have energy in and of themselves, and that matter springs from these thoughts. His lecture was extremely enlightening.It was a marvelous talk, an even better meditation session afterwards, and at the very end, the twenty or so of us present got very silly, rapping Rumi poetry to the beat of tabla drums. Musician Dave Stewart was in our group.  We actually made Dave go out to his bus and bring in his guitar so he could play and we could continue to rap Rumi.  I felt like I was on LSD, and  by midnight I found myself in an odd corner, in conversation with Deepak, Dave, and Fred.I am not making this up.  You can't make this stuff up.Fred said that he dreamed of making a film in which quantum physics would be explained in a comic fashion to lay people. His fantasy was to make it a la Monty Python. He felt that by de-mystifying the concepts of the quantum reality and infusing it with slapstick humor, people who were otherwise unschooled in it would not only ""get it"", but could incorporate it into their approach to life, for their betterment and the betterment of humankind.Dave, who was as blown away by Fred as the rest of us, remarked that in a couple of days he was returning to London, where he was going to be meeting Eric Idle concerning a music project. He vowed to somehow get Fred and Eric together.  Fred was very excited. The synchronicity of the evening was a mirror of the concepts discussed.From the film credits, it looks as though Idle didn't get directly involved. But clearly this is the film that was just a dream in Fred Alan Wolf's mind back in early 2001.It took him three years. What could each of us do in three years if we intended it?Do you want the red pill or the blue pill, Neo?If you imagine it, so shall it be. And if your Christian/Jewish/Muslim/Vedic/you-name-it texts didn't demonstrate that clearly enough for you, then perhaps this psychedelic mind trip of a whirling dervish will help you out.

The supposed experts use discredited interpretations of physics, outright frauds (the water crystal revelations), and pronouncements from a purportedly channeled entity (Ramtha) to drive this outrageous point home.However, this worldview is illogical, amoral, and dangerous. Thus, no one should believe it.1. One expert, a theologian (!) speaks of the terrible idea that there is evil in the world. If the idea is so terrible, it would be evil. So evil would exist after all. This is a contradiction and cannot be true. Ramtha says, ""You are not good. You are not evil. You are god."" However, no one--outside of a sociopath--can live out this amoral worldview consistently. If you don't think the attack on America on September 11 was not evil, there is simply something wrong with you. If you don't think rape, child molestation, and racism is objectively evil, then you are radically out of step with reality. You need help from outside of yourself.2. If we ""create our own reality,"" why are we so horrendously bad at it? Why does one the experts (a chiropractor, no less) struggle with his postnasal drip every time he is on camera? Why has JZ Knight (the channeler for Ramtha) aged so terribly in the past fifteen years? They are gods, for God's sake! Why are we gods such underachievers, so retarded? It simply makes no sense. What makes more sense is that we are creatures of God, east of Eden and under God.3. The view promoted by the film is also dangerous because it uproots us from any stable sense of objective reality--morally, metaphysically, or spiritually. We do not create our own reality; although we are morally responsible for how we live our lives. We have to live in terms of the reality that has been given to us, including our finitude, fallibility, and moral failings.

This particular piece of fluff features a cast of mystics, fringe scientists, and philosophers doing a 2-hour infomercial for the New Age movement.  Oh and there's an extensive interview with a 35,000 year old warrior from Atlantis.  The film careens through a series of sound-bites from each of these characters, interspersed with silly special effects and a pointless plotline about a deaf photographer.Here's an immediate warning sign:  The film doesn't identify the names or credentials of any of the interviewees, even though they spend a lot of time talking about fairly technical issues, particularly quantum mechanics.  Be concerned about this.  The filmmakers are trying to convince you that there is a broad consensus between mystical gurus and professional scientists on the way the world works.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  To set the record straight on a few things:1)  It is not true that people are unable to perceive visual objects that they are unfamiliar with.  Question:  What did the Eiffel Tower look like the first time you saw it?  Answer:  The Eiffel Tower.2)  Quantum physics does not prove or even suggest that humans create their own reality.3)  People cannot walk on water, no matter how hard they try.4)  Seeing something is not the same thing as thinking about seeing something.5)  It is not possible to change the molecular structure of water or anything else by affixing written words to containers.6)  There is no evidence that transcendental meditation can lower a city's crime rate.In short, the main message of the film is that the universe is constructed of material that is responsive to human thought and emotion.  This has got to be the most enduring bad idea in human history.  It's literally a child's view of the world, in which one's emotional state works its way into every aspect of reality.  Most adults learn that the real world doesn't work this way, and the ones that attain some level of science education quickly lose interest in this way of thinking.  The true nature of science is simply a lot more interesting.One star added because much of the movie's script appears to be based on the episode of Star Trek in which the guy from the A-Team mind-melds with the holodeck.",2,How to get confused about science,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,2364,"['Not', 'Trefethen', '1979', 'album', 'Am', 'Stupid', 'Am', 'great', 'there', 'been', 'work', 'such', 'unintentionally', 'apt', 'title', 'particular', 'piece', 'fluff', 'cast', 'mystics', 'fringe', 'scientists', 'philosophers', 'doing', '2-hour', 'infomercial', 'New', 'Age', 'movement', 'Oh', 'extensive', 'interview', '35,000', 'year', 'old', 'warrior', 'Atlantis', 'film', 'series', 'sound-bites', 'characters', 'interspersed', 'silly', 'special', 'effects', 'pointless', 'plotline', 'deaf', 'immediate', 'warning', 'sign', 'film', ""n't"", 'identify', 'names', 'credentials', 'interviewees', 'even', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'talking', 'fairly', 'technical', 'issues', 'particularly', 'quantum', 'mechanics', 'Be', 'concerned', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'trying', 'convince', 'broad', 'consensus', 'mystical', 'gurus', 'professional', 'scientists', 'way', 'world', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'farther', 'truth', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'few', 'things:1', 'not', 'true', 'people', 'are', 'unable', 'perceive', 'visual', 'objects', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Question', 'What', 'did', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'look', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Answer', 'Eiffel', 'Tower.2', 'Quantum', 'physics', 'not', 'prove', 'even', 'suggest', 'humans', 'create', 'own', 'reality.3', 'People', 'can', 'not', 'walk', 'water', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try.4', 'Seeing', 'something', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'thinking', 'seeing', 'something.5', 'not', 'possible', 'change', 'molecular', 'structure', 'water', 'anything', 'else', 'affixing', 'written', 'words', 'containers.6', 'evidence', 'transcendental', 'meditation', 'can', 'lower', 'city', 'crime', 'rate.In', 'short', 'main', 'message', 'film', 'universe', 'constructed', 'material', 'responsive', 'human', 'thought', 'emotion', 'got', 'be', 'most', 'enduring', 'bad', 'idea', 'human', 'history', 'literally', 'child', 'view', 'world', 'one', 'emotional', 'state', 'way', 'aspect', 'reality', 'Most', 'adults', 'learn', 'real', 'world', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'ones', 'attain', 'level', 'science', 'education', 'quickly', 'lose', 'interest', 'way', 'thinking', 'true', 'nature', 'science', 'simply', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting.One', 'star', 'added', 'because', 'much', 'movie', 'script', 'be', 'based', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'guy', 'A-Team', 'mind-melds', 'holodeck']",N/A

I am not sure what to make of ""WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW"", but I know it is worth watching at least once, and if you find it interesting, as I have, perhaps more than once.IN A NUTSHELL: Call it ""Sacred Science"" or ""What the Bleep do we know?The original name for the film was ""Sacred Science"" if that is any help, but what it gets into is basically the idea of ""I think, therefore I am."" Stephen Hawking wrote a couple of very important and interesting books titled ""The Universe In A Nutshell"" and ""A Brief History of Time"", the latter of which was made into an interesting film as well which also delves into similar themes. Are we indeed happening to reality or is reality happening to us? Quantum Physics literally explores countless possibilites and probabilites so obviously the choices and outcomes are - well - countless! Unfortunately, so too are the theories!BUT THERE IS MORE THAN THAT: There's a story too -- SORT OF . .Many of the quantum speculations are put forth by ""talking heads"" and then acted out in a sort of story of the mind, and reality, starring Marlee Matlin. In this story, we see reality, the mind, and something that is tangible but different and difficult to quantify enter into human relations. It's almost as though the thinking power of the mind and its emotions combine to form something that alters reality, and the perception of reality, so that different people in the exact same setting may see, experience, and feel very different things.ONE MINOR CRITICISM: A LOT OF INFORMATION DOES NOT EQUAL A LOT OF KNOWLEDGEIf I were to pose one point of criticism, many of the interviews contained in the ""Special Features"" section highlighted the notion that the film ""presents a great deal of information"". There is a large gulf between information and knowledge because knowledge makes information useful. To a degree, the knowledge to be gained from this subject is still in the future and depends on the psychology and wisdom of the viewer but, as this film clearly illustrates, we as human beings are getting closer to that understanding in our journey toward our ultimate destination in the universe. Of course, in Quantum Physics, what happens in the future may not necessarily take place on a linear time-frame.ABOUT THE DVD:----- SPECIAL FEATURES:There are interviews with the actors, especially Marlee Matlin, and the production team and the authorities [""talking heads""] on the subject too!

Great production value and the CGI animation is top-notch. My wife and I had a great time laughing over the animated cells and neurons and peptides. Best fun we had over the week.OK. Now on to the content. This is a project that ""pretends"" to be scientific when it is the same-old New Age mumbo-jumbo that you can get for ten cents in any bargain store. It begins with Quantum Physics and tells us how the world needs to be redefined. It tells us that we live in a wild, new world of possibilities where reality itself is not static but dynamic. All fine and good. Then somewhere along the line, it suggests that the cheapo New-Age teachings of monism, metaphysical-mind-science-techniques, ""We-Are-All-Gods"", etc. are the direct applications of this same science. In fact, the movie moves seamlessly from the exposition to the application - the result is something that *seemed* to make sense on a casual viewing. But if you scrutinize it a little bit more you'll start to see that all the ""science"" here is merely a smokescreen to give the eclectic-cheapo-mix-and-match spirituality of the New Age Movement a sort of respectability and legitimacy - almost like making it a science!Watch this for a good laugh... and also to see how respectable, educated professors today can be so dumb as to accept this crap to be the basis for their beliefs!",3,Did I miss something?,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,1579,"['What', 'Bleep', 'Do', 'Know', 'multimedia', 'textbook', 'DVD', 'disguised', 'movie', 'applaud', 'people', 'project', 'making', 'very', 'different', 'type', 'independent', 'movie', 'tap', 'market', 'DIY', 'metaphysicians', 'quacks', 'Great', 'production', 'value', 'CGI', 'animation', 'top-notch', 'wife', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'laughing', 'animated', 'cells', 'neurons', 'peptides', 'Best', 'fun', 'had', 'week.OK', 'Now', 'content', 'project', 'pretends', 'be', 'scientific', 'when', 'same-old', 'New', 'Age', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'can', 'get', 'ten', 'cents', 'bargain', 'store', 'Quantum', 'Physics', 'tells', 'how', 'world', 'be', 'redefined', 'live', 'wild', 'new', 'world', 'possibilities', 'where', 'reality', 'not', 'static', 'dynamic', 'fine', 'good', 'Then', 'somewhere', 'line', 'cheapo', 'New-Age', 'teachings', 'monism', 'metaphysical-mind-science-techniques', 'We-Are-All-Gods', 'etc', 'are', 'direct', 'applications', 'same', 'science', 'fact', 'movie', 'seamlessly', 'exposition', 'application', 'result', 'something', 'make', 'sense', 'casual', 'viewing', 'scrutinize', 'little', 'bit', 'more', ""'ll"", 'start', 'see', 'science', 'here', 'merely', 'smokescreen', 'give', 'eclectic-cheapo-mix-and-match', 'spirituality', 'New', 'Age', 'Movement', 'sort', 'respectability', 'legitimacy', 'almost', 'making', 'science', 'Watch', 'good', 'laugh', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'respectable', 'educated', 'professors', 'today', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'dumb', 'accept', 'crap', 'be', 'basis', 'beliefs']",N/A

Cloying and manipulative would be two good descriptions.  Mary Matalin was awesome in ""Children of a Lesser God"" but here I often felt embarassed for her as she struggled to make the best of the hopelessly corny script, it felt so transparently didactic that it reminded me of some PBS late afternoon children's programming.  The cutesy partial animation was especially hard to stomach...ugh!For a truly enlightening review of this movie, I recommed John Gorenfeld's 9/16/2004 article in Salon.com entitled ""Bleep of Faith"" wherein he exposes a lot of the shaky science the movie is based on (some of the ""scientific experts"" quoted in the film subsequently distanced themselves from it after seeing how their words were taken out of context and distorted) and the shady, cult-like group called the Ramtha School of Enlightenment (on par with L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology for hokiness) which funded this $5M project.Overall though, I am glad that this film was made and so many people had a chance to see it---it's a shame it was not released in the multiplexes more widely, since it's the people who usually eat up Hollywood mass movie glop who would get the most out of it, rather than the already-converted art/alternative film crowd.Given a choice between mindless religious fundamentalism and mindless materialistic dogmatism, Ramtha doesn't look all that bad...LOL!",3,"a 4 for content, a 2 for style = 3 overall",1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,2370,"['CONTENT', 'film', 'present', 'desperately', 'needed', 'antidote', 'alternative', 'stifling', 'rigidity', 'religious', 'fundamentalism', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'believe', 'what', 'religious', 'institutions', 'tell', 'rationalistic', 'dogmatism', 'so-called', 'skeptical', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'believe', 'what', 'senses', 'tell', 'write', 'everything', 'else', 'off', 'superstition', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'common', 'spiritual', 'conditions', 'today.If', 'fall', 'two', 'camps', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'influenced', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'indeed', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'either', 'mind', 'much', 'opened', 'feeling', 'very', 'threatened', 'and/or', 'shaken', 'are', 'already', 'very', 'familiar', 'types', 'ideas', 'was', 'will', 'mostly', 'sound', 'old', 'hat.STYLE', 'where', 'film', 'fell', 'flat', 'face', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'slick', 'cheesy', 'training/orientation', 'video', 'many', 'corporations', 'have', 'new', 'employees', 'watch', 'first', 'day', 'Cloying', 'manipulative', 'would', 'be', 'two', 'good', 'descriptions', 'Mary', 'Matalin', 'was', 'awesome', 'Children', 'Lesser', 'God', 'here', 'often', 'felt', 'embarassed', 'struggled', 'make', 'best', 'hopelessly', 'corny', 'script', 'felt', 'so', 'transparently', 'didactic', 'reminded', 'PBS', 'late', 'afternoon', 'children', 'programming', 'cutesy', 'partial', 'animation', 'was', 'especially', 'hard', 'stomach', 'ugh', 'truly', 'enlightening', 'review', 'movie', 'recommed', 'John', 'Gorenfeld', '9/16/2004', 'article', 'Salon.com', 'entitled', 'Bleep', 'Faith', 'wherein', 'lot', 'shaky', 'science', 'movie', 'based', 'scientific', 'experts', 'quoted', 'film', 'subsequently', 'distanced', 'seeing', 'how', 'words', 'were', 'taken', 'context', 'distorted', 'shady', 'cult-like', 'group', 'called', 'Ramtha', 'School', 'Enlightenment', 'par', 'L.', 'Ron', 'Hubbard', 'Church', 'Scientology', 'hokiness', 'funded', '5M', 'project.Overall', 'am', 'glad', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'shame', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'multiplexes', 'more', 'widely', 'people', 'who', 'usually', 'eat', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'mass', 'movie', 'glop', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'most', 'rather', 'already-converted', 'art/alternative', 'film', 'choice', 'mindless', 'religious', 'fundamentalism', 'mindless', 'materialistic', 'dogmatism', 'Ramtha', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'LOL']",N/A

192754,ACJTUFZEUCCBL,1582704414,"Eolake ""eolake (.com)""","[12, 16]","What The Bleep Do We Know?A very popular film indeed, for good reason. It introduces many of the Mind-Over-Matter concepts in a concise way, and it does it very entertainingly indeed, a great trick to pull off!Mankind is currently in the middle of possibly the biggest spiritual renaissance in history.There are literally hundreds of books written in the past decade about how spirituality and science are now meeting in the middle, to a new awareness of how we are all of us taking part in the creation and the control of the universe, of our own bodies and even way beyond that.It is a tricky subject. Most of us get strong emotional reactions to such statements. We know damn well that we are not god or anything like him. We know that we are just small particles blown about by the winds and the wims of the big, cold universe. We know we are victims.Responsibility is a frightening thing. And ""with big powers come big responsibility"", as one of the good ole superheroes likes to point out. What if we are not really small helpless victims who deserve all the sympathy we can get when we whine about the government and how the rest of the big cruel world does us in? What if in reality we are really running the show from a secret little place hidden away in our mind, and if we really wanted, we could take over that power, and potentially change not only our own lives completely, but also have big effects on the world beyond? Yes, very scary indeed.Yet also exhilarating... what if shirking our responsibility does not really relieve us of it, but instead buries it underground, where it becomes a nasty zombie monster which we have nightmares about in the night, but which only became a monster because we tried to kill it? What if a ""big responsibility"", when accepted boldly into our lives is not anything scary or negative at all, but a thing as natural as breathing, and indeed even very easy to live with? Indeed, what if wielding your superman-like powers and responsibilities can one day seem kid's play?The interesting thing about this particular spiritual renaissance is that this time it is not just coming from a few nutcases and hardcore philosophical fringe groups. It is not just spiritual teachers in lotus positions who tells us that ""you are creating the universe"". This time it is coming from all kinds of places. And this includes hard core scientist.Yes, that's right. In the past several decades, more and more top-rank scientists, including nobel-prize winners, have started talking about how there are energy fields outside the areas we normally have recognized as ""physical"" and how life force seems to be one of them. They have talked about how at a sub-atomic level (quantum level) the universe does not follow traditional (Newtonian) rules, and things can be more than one place at once, and super-light speeds are attainable. They talk about how the observer in ACTUAL EXPERIMENTS have measurable influence on the outcome of the experiment, just by the expectations he holds in his mind!In addition, many, many experiments have been carried out by both scientists, mystic groups, and Eastern and Western religious groups, many of which show beyond any reasonable doubt that prayer or meditation (in other words, deciding on or expecting a certain thing to be true) DOES IN FACT influence the the real world in a very measurable way. People are affecting the healing of other people with illnesses in double-blind studies, and they are affecting the crime rates of major areas by their minds.I frankly will not bother to document all these things here, for they are documented in literally hundreds of books. If you do a few searches on Amazon, you will find them. Some are written for scientists, others are more accessible for laymen.This revolution is huge. I have long had no doubt that almost all the ills of mankind (the four horsemen of the apocalypse: War, Hunger, Pestilence, and Italian Pop Music) are mainly based in a mechanistic view of the universe. If you are just a meat machine, and others are only upright animals, who cares what you do to them? If you die when your body dies, who cares about the effects of your actions in 500 years? If you are the whipping boy of the world, who can blame you if retaliate with a few morally doubtful actions of your own?Not to mention, if you have no clue that your thoughts, your emotions, and most of all your expectations are the very thing which are creating your life, in the big and in the small, then obviously you will not be aware that it is probably not a good idea to expect a whole lot of undesirable things to happen to you! You will not be aware of the amazing things you can make happen just by thinking and feeling.The long and the short of these developments is: we are not in Kansas anymore. And when this hits the mainstream consciousness for real, I doubt we will even be on the Earth anymore, as we know it.

Sloppy marketing and bizarre 'capsules' about the film placed in the media did not entice viewers to see this film, reducing the fascinating content to perplexing, head-scratching moments of trying to decide what the film was about - religion?, insanity?, anime?, silliness with animation?.Those fortunate enough to have friends who took a chance on it most certainly subsequently saw the movie when it was in the theatres.  Now that the film is on DVD perhaps it will hopefully be 'accidentally' picked out of the current dearth of available films being released - and what a pleasure that will provide to those lucky grab-baggers!  Now that there is a full resource of reviews on Amazon.com, hopefully more people will find their way into the  mental gymnastics contained in this immensely interesting foray into Quantum Physics.Not to belabor the content, this is an amalgam of commentaries from physicists, physicians, writers, theorists, and yes, even channelers! (David Albert, Amit Goswani, John Hagelin, Candace Perth, Ramtha, William Tiller, Fred Allen Wolf) all of whom provide the most understandable, digestible explanation of Quantum Physics (the realm of probabilities and possibilities resulting from the fact that since we are all minute particles/subatoms that interact actively with everything else in the universe, we control our own reality, etc).  To pull these myriad facts together in a recognizable (key word, it turns out!) form, the three writer directors have elected to 'demonstrate' the thoughts of these bright thinkers by using Marlee Maitlin as a photographer at odds with her past and present and future and we watch as concepts of quantum physics are introduced to her by a young basketball player, by animation rides through synapses and the universe, by split images through her own lens, by her kookie radical delightful roommate (Elaine Hendrix).To say more would disturb the excitement of the journey this film provides.  How refreshing that the creators of this little epic have the courage to combine science and 'religion' in a manner that makes thinking about the progenitor of all existence a warm wholly integrated part of ourselves!  The 'take home' message (or at least one of the many) is that we can determine our own reality and thus we are empowered to create a life and world and cosmos that has endless possibilities for positive directions.  Some naysayers condemn this film as a propaganda piece for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment, saying that it is just another scientific religious cult like Scientology.  You be the judge of that premise.Remember the excitement, the 'a-ha! moments, in college when knowledge became near tangible portions of our minds?  Well, here it is all over again.

It's informative and keeps your attention and the visual effects were excellent.The first part of the film delves into the world of Quantum Physics without showing a single mathematical equation!  The first questions in the film revolve around how one defines reality, why we are here, the nature of matter and how we fit into the whole scheme of things.  I was reminded of some of the things I learned in my Physics courses in school such as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Priciple, the notion that atoms are not things but tendencies and some other ideas from quantum mechanics.  When I was taking Physics as a Math major, I focused more on the mathematical theory and solving problems than the external ideas such as those presented in this film.  This film really showed me that one doesn't have to know an ounce of Math to love, appreciate and learn a great deal of high level Physics.  The next part of the film focuses more on biology... the mind, thoughts and how they shape us and our reality.  The notion that the mind doesn't know the difference between what the eyes see and what one imagines is a very fascinating fact to me.  This has so many interesting ramifications!  Matter is simply a moment of consciousness, hence the phrase ""mind over matter"".  The part about emotions being holographically imprinted chemicals which are addictive was the most impressive part of the film to me.  If you are skeptical about emotions being addictive, consider this: the drug heroin uses the same receptor mechanizms on the cells that our emotional chemicals use.  So emotions are not just psychological but bio-chemical.  I've got to read more into this fascinating subject!The thing that I really like about this film is the fact that it underscores the notion that we are our own greatest enemies.

I am not sure what to make of ""WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW"", but I know it is worth watching at least once, and if you find it interesting, as I have, perhaps more than once.IN A NUTSHELL: Call it ""Sacred Science"" or ""What the Bleep do we know?The original name for the film was ""Sacred Science"" if that is any help, but what it gets into is basically the idea of ""I think, therefore I am."" Stephen Hawking wrote a couple of very important and interesting books titled ""The Universe In A Nutshell"" and ""A Brief History of Time"", the latter of which was made into an interesting film as well which also delves into similar themes. Are we indeed happening to reality or is reality happening to us? Quantum Physics literally explores countless possibilites and probabilites so obviously the choices and outcomes are - well - countless! Unfortunately, so too are the theories!BUT THERE IS MORE THAN THAT: There's a story too --Many of the quantum speculations are put forth by ""talking heads"" and then acted out in a sort of story of the mind, and reality, starring Marlee Matlin. In this story, we see reality, the mind, and something that is tangible but different and difficult to quantify enter into human relations. It's almost as though the thinking power of the mind and its emotions combine to form something that alters reality, and the perception of reality, so that different people in the exact same setting may see, experience, and feel very different things.ONE MINOR CRITICISM: A LOT OF INFORMATION DOES NOT EQUAL A LOT OF KNOWLEDGEIf I were to pose one point of criticism, many of the interviews contained in the ""Special Features"" section highlighted the notion that the film ""presents a great deal of information"". There is a large gulf between information and knowledge because knowledge makes information useful. To a degree, the knowledge to be gained from this subject is still in the future and depends on the psychology and wisdom of the viewer but, as this film clearly illustrates, we as human beings are getting closer to that understanding in our journey toward our ultimate destination in the universe. Of course, in Quantum Physics, what happens in the future may not necessarily take place on a linear time-frame.ABOUT THE DVD:----- SPECIAL FEATURES:There are interviews with the actors, especially Marlee Matlin, and the production team and the authorities [""talking heads""] on the subject too!

The ""experts"" who claim to understand quantum physics spew nonsense and obviously got most of their background by reading a Dummies' Guide; or their comments were quoted out of context to support the movie's basic theme.  The whole idea of quantum theory being applicable to metaphysics is stuff and nonsense invented by people who are trying to sell hokum to the masses.  Sadly, they succeed on a regular basis, as the success of this film shows.The idea of ""subjective reality"" is one often hawked by religious movements as a way to attract the faithful; but if we're able to generate our own reality, why would anyone choose to be poor, sick, downtrodden, or otherwise unhappy?  If all we need to do is think good thoughts and have a positive attitude in order to succeed, then we should all have the ability to be successful.  Sadly this is all feel-nice claptrap a'la the New Age movement, which is in itself based on total fantasy invented by its primary proponents.  Yes, a positive attitude is generally better than a negative one, as the former often causes the same reaction in others.  The workplace and society in general reward positive thinking.  But this cannot and should not be extrapolated into a metaphysical ""we affect our reality"" mythology since there is no objective evidence to support it.The film and the myth surrounding it also try to convince us that objective knowledge is impossible.  Rubbish.  While it is certain that all humans filter events through their senses and perceptions, this does not translate to an absence of objective fact.  Here again we see the New Age movement's pseudoscientific bent, as it tacks made-up metaphysical nonsense onto snippets of legitimate science.In another vein, isn't it suspicious that the ""Ramtha"" character invented by JZ Knight demands money (that he can't use, being long dead) in exchange for the alleged ""cosmic knowledge"" he has to impart?  Isn't this a convenient excuse to found a religion and pay no taxes on your income?The West, and the US in particular, has become particularly vulnerable to hucksters selling New Age beliefs, largely due to ongoing scientific discoveries that have increasingly invalidated the dogma offered by more established religious bodies.  New Age beliefs seek to reconcile the human need for something greater than themselves with our rapidly increasing understanding of the physical world; they do this by cloaking mysticism in terms of science.

Fortunately for us, Arntz ignored their discouraging pronouncements-and this gem of a movie ended up becoming a box office phenomenon, largely by overwhelmingly positive word-of-mouth.What the Bleep Do We Know!? blends interviews with scientists, neurobiologists, quantum physicists, and a 35,000 year old being with live action and wondrous special effects. Oscar winner Marlee Matlin plays a jaded photographer named Amanda who falls down a metaphysical rabbit hole. Through a series of mind-bending events, Amanda is forced to confront what she thought was reality-as well as the source of her boredom, anxiety, and self-contempt.In light of quantum physics (which, in a nutshell, is the physics of probabilities), the filmmakers explore the concept of multiple realities existing at once. While parallel, alternate universes are the stuff of Star Trek, this concept isn't so far fetched considering scientists have produced a particle of light that exists in two places at the same time. Not only that, electrons and the nuclei of atoms completely disappear and reappear all the time. Where do they go? If this happens on an atomic level, what does this mean for the macro level?Rather than reality happening to us, as the old model assumed, we are happening to reality. The act of observation...or ""locking into"" something...actually changes the nature of what is observed. The act of choice eliminates all other probabilities. If this is true at the quantum level, how do our choices affect-and indeed, change-reality?Everything ""out there"" is a projection of our mind's elaborate theater, which is often the result of complex neurobiology that happens ""in here"". With vibrant computer animation and lucid scientific explanations, we are shown what happens when cells are consistently bathed in neurochemicals produced by habitual emotions: emotional addiction. ""If we can be addicted to heroin, we can be addicted to any neuropeptide (emotion)"", says one scientist. Another scientist asserts: ""Who is in the driver's seat when we control our emotions or respond to emotions? We know physiologically that nerve cells that fire together rewire together. If you practice something over and over, those nerve cells have a long-term relationship."" In other words, if you get angry on a daily basis...or feel like a victim...you are literally re-wiring your neural net to the point of creating an ""identity"". The good news is that ""every time we interrupt the thought process that produces a chemical response in the body, they start breaking the long-term relationship.""So what does this have to do with the nature of reality? It comes back to choice. We create scenarios that meet our emotional needs. This is why many fall into the same type of relationships and dramas: there is a chemical addiction to rejection, conflict, seduction, and so on. One scientist remarked: ""An awful lot of problems that get labeled as psychological really amount to people making rotten choices..."" What is thought of as ""reality just happening to us"" is really a result of consistent choices producing specific chemicals which result in specific emotions that have become a habit. Instead of ""people always sabotage my happiness"", it becomes a matter of chemical addiction to sabotaging scenarios. We draw in from the ""quantum field"" according to our intention, expectation, and (in this case) emotional addiction.If this is true of the individual, what of the assumptions of a culture? Every generation has many hidden assumptions that history ahs proven to be untrue (such as the idea that the Earth is flat). Many of these assumptions are so ingrained, we take them for granted as ""the truth"".Asking questions like ""Why am I here? Where am I going? Who am I? What happens when I die?""-the questioning of reality and how things ""have always been done""-help us to interrupt the neural nets. Becoming the ""observer"" (as opposed to an unconscious reactionary) can result in paradigm shifts, ""aha!"" moments, and personal change.Contemplating a new way of thinking or seeing is tricky, however. A fascinating story that's demonstrated in What the Bleep is that of Christopher Columbus visiting the indigenous people of South America. Because clipper ships were totally out of the realm of their reality, these people could not see the ships on the horizon. One day, the tribal shaman realized there were ripples coming towards shore. He knew that something must be causing those ripples...but what? Day after day he strained to see, until one day, he finally saw the ships approaching. His people couldn't see them, until he described to them what he saw. Because they trusted him, they could now see the ships with their own eyes.This story illustrates the principle that we can only see in our brain what we're able to see. In fact, we only see what we believe is possible. Perhaps this explains why mystics can see angels and other realities: for them, believing is seeing. Biologically, the brain processes 400 billion bits of information per second, but is only aware of 2,000 bits at any one time-usually information about our environment, body, and time. Just what is the brain perceiving that we are not ""seeing"" or integrating?In addition to the science of perception and reality, a theologian, Ramtha (an ancient being channeled by J.Z. Knight), and other scientists discuss the nature of God, spirituality, and the interconnection of all things. One of the problems of religion, according to one theologian, is that God has been made into a distinct, separate entity to which we must offer worship, humor, and please-all in the hopes to get a reward at the end of life (not to mention avoiding the frying pan). According to this man, ""this is not what God is. That is blasphemy.""Ramtha echoes this sentiment with my favorite quote from the movie:""God must be greater than the greatest of human weaknesses and, indeed, the greatest of human skill. God must even transcend our most remarkable-to emulate nature in its absolute splendor. How can any man or woman sin against such greatness of mind? How can one little carbon unit on Earth-in the backwaters of the Milky Way, the boondocks-betray God almighty? That is impossible. The height of arrogance is the height of control of those who create God in their own image.""Whether you agree with the ideas presented in the movie is not the point. If individuals at least contemplate an alternative perspective-then this movie will have succeeded. What the Bleep Do We Know!? doesn't tell you what to think, but simply offers ideas and theories for your consideration. At the very least, it opens up a dialogue between people. And, perhaps, if people start talking to one another-especially about concepts like reality, God, spirituality, choice, and human potential-there will be enough cracks in individual and collective assumptions to make way for ideas never before considered as possible.",4,"A Movie Examining Reality, God, Choice and Other Issues",1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,7804,"['beginning', 'was', 'void',

192770,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,1582704414,Jason Horsley,"[7, 10]","The What the Bleep Do We Know? sequel, Down the Rabbit Hole is a movie that ought to carry a warning to lactose- (and lachrymose-) intolerant viewers: ""Contains potentially dangerous levels of cheese.""A quasi-documentary about ""the fundamental truth of unity,"" Bleep 2 is more New Age physics for lazy laypeople to ooh and ah over. In fact, it is more of a remake than a sequel, a compendium of stuff left out of the first movie, perhaps, and with nothing at all by way of upgrading in evidence. 2 hours of ineptly staged dramatizations and waffling interviews with self-satisfied ""experts,"" and perhaps a half hour of original material to justify, however limply, its existence, Bleep 2 is a shameless cash-in on the first film's success that suffers from all the failings of the original. Despite the larger budget and longer running time, the filmmakers have chosen not to develop their technique in any significant ways, revealing their utter complacency as ""artists,"" and betraying a smug simple-mindedness and appalling lack of imagination completely at odds with the ""ground-breaking"" nature of their material. I can only presume they considered the original formula to be already perfect and that, since it wasn't broken, why fix it?The first movie made money and seemed to spark interest and excitement in the most unlikely of viewers, viewers perhaps grateful that such ideas were getting air-time at all in a popular movie. Yet it's hard to imagine a work whose style is so profoundly in conflict with its content, that juxtaposes such profound, challenging ideas with so daffy and clich&eacute;d an execution. The expressed end of the Bleep films appears diametrically opposed to the means employed. They propose to present a whole new paradigm by which to interpret our reality (and live our lives), a quantum weltanschauung if you will; yet the methods employed are so profane and uninspired that the result is rather to discredit (if not actually debase) the awesome concepts which these films are so gleeful to bandy about. By endeavoring to deliver the findings of cutting edge physics to the mass consciousness, the Bleep films are the quintessence of New Age reductionism. They present a lowest common denominated version of the Mysteries, selling audiences life-changing ideas in cozy, non-threatening forms, so that the masses can have their manna and eat it, feel ""enlightened"" without having to change in any meaningful way.In a quantum Universe in which information determines the spin of each and every particle, the Bleep movies spin their information into one big, dull, self-satisfied blah. As with all things New Age, by focusing exclusively on a positive ""spin,"" they render the subject flat, two-dimensional. Throwing around words like God, eternal, absolute, infinite energy, consciousness, etc, with so little force or precision saps not only the words but the concepts behind them of power and vitality. The concepts may reach more people by being so diluted--thinned out--but at what price? This user-friendly, multiplex-tailored view of occult realities is as far from shamanism as art from kitsch (and kitsch is what the Bleep movies are).Fuzzy-headed professionals talking about the power of the brain? People we would avoid like the plague at a dinner party holding forth on ""avenues of reality, unborn"" and ""infinite tomorrows."" Please.Words, words, words, but where is the spirit? Images that belong in a Gatorade commercial not in a movie about time and space. The magical Universe seen through the lens of the Bleep movies becomes the asinine universe.

192772,ATWX9WCEACYYW,1582704414,J. Blilie,"[5, 7]","I'm not really sure why I'm bothering to review this film.  Except that I heard a woman on the radio the other day referring to this film as if it were a source of knowledge.  This concerns me.  It (like creationism/ID) is another example of the scientific illiteracy in the US.  I'm not going to try to catalog the silliness of this film, but I'll hit some of the ""high"" points.The main feature of this film is a series of talking heads that spout sound bites that are meant to sound ""scientific"" and mysterious and amazing.  I'm not surprised they don't identify them; why should we listen to anything these people say?  They provide no data and make many bald-faced assertions that are false, misleading, and unsupportable.  They spout fluff like:  ""this requires a whole new science,"" ""we can't explain X,"" ""if you look into it carefully, it's so strange that there's just no way science can explain it,"" ""Heisenberg himself said ...,"" ""scientific experiments have shown ..."" [why do they never cite the journal article for these ""amazing facts?""], ad nauseum.All this ""information"" is supposed to make you think (at least this is the message I heard):1. Dualism is true [it's not]2. You can create your own reality by conscious will [you can't]3. You can time-travel, change the form of matter, etc. [you can't]4. Science actually doesn't support naturalism; but rather some kind of new-age spiritualism/mysticism [it doesn't; scientific knowledge supports naturalism in every detail]The silly non-sequiturs include, primarily:1. Certain very strange things happen with matter at the subatomic level, therefore they can occur at the middle-world scale of our bodies.  For instance:  the fact that you can't measure both the location and velocity of a subatomic particle at the same time means that the middle-world objects around you don't exist until you observe them.  [We experience is the SUM of trillions of motions of subatomic particles that actually does act just like we perceive it does, on our scale.  The fact that you can't localize an electron does not mean we don't understand the macro (middle-world) behavior of matter very exactly.  People in China do actually exist and live their lives whether you observe them or not.  You may be ignorant of them; but that has no causal effect on their actual existence.]2. ""X"" is deeply perplexing or difficult to understand, therefore it's a ""mystery,"" therefore something supernatural must be going on, therefore that's somehow comforting.  [""X"" includes (of course!) quantum physics, human consciousness, the subatomic world, etc.  These things are perplexing because our brains evolved to help our DNA replicate in our ""middle-world"" of objects from the size of sand grains to mountains (as opposed to the atomic/subatomic or very large (stars/galaxies/the universe) scale.)  The subatomic world is completely different from middle-world, as is the very large.  We only needed a useful (for propagating DNA) model of the world in our consciousness, not an accurate model of all reality.  Your or my lack of intellectual skills does not warp space-time, nor does it imply or require ANYTHING about the nature of reality.]3. Science doesn't have the perfect model of how sub-atomic and astro-physical scale events behave, therefore your brain creates its own reality and you can travel backward or forward in time, walk on water or whatever.  [Do I need to even comment?]4. The mathematics that describe the physical world have a time scale (dimension) that mathematically allows ""motion"" in both directions.  Therefore we can time travel using our minds.  And the corollary:  the direction of time seems real; but is arbitrary and we can't prove why it goes the way it seems to us that it does.  [The first statement is trivial, since math always allows this.  There IS a real direction to time:  It is most forcefully pointed by the increase of entropy of the universe as a whole.]5. In the past we used to think that the earth was flat, then we thought it was round, now (in the post-modernist miasma of the film) we can't be sure that it really IS round, since we were wrong about it being flat.  [Again, there is a direction to our accumulating real knowledge of the world.  We do know that the earth is round and revolves around the sun, it's not a guess.  And it will be round and revolving long after we are gone.]The ""dramatized"" parts, that purport to show Marlee Matlin making some kind of ""spiritual journey"" replete with time-travel and Matrix-like special effects, are just amazingly lame.  This film isn't just lame, it's supine.  It doesn't need a cane or a walker, it needs a complete ICU.  The acting is abysmal, as is the dialog.This film purports to address the ""Big Questions,"" like, why are we here [it's not a question that requires or deserves an answer], how did we get here [we evolved from earlier mammals in Africa], the meaning of life [if there is one it's:  replicate your DNA], the nature of consciousness [If you actually want to learn something, please read ""Consciousness Explained"" by Dennett and Pinker's books on consciousness]:  you know, the usual suspects.  But, again, it just lamely tries to make it all mysterious and pseudo-scientific by innuendo.  This is the very worst kind of new-age fluff and pseudo-science magic that tries to replace the comfort of religion with the comfort of some other sort of supernatural delusion.  As science has found actual, useful, verifiable knowledge about the world/universe/life, the magical ""explanations"" of religion have been replaced.  But most people seem to desire the comfort of religion, mystery, whatever.  This film is the kind of thing that results.  Don't fall for this snake oil.

It brings together several different types of media including documentary, story, and elaborate visual effects and animations to explain the foundations of quantum physics and how it correlates into religion, Positive Thinking (or Positive Psychology) and consciousness/reality in which we all view ourselves in! The protagonist, played by Marlee Matlin, takes the viewer on a journey throughout the movie based in a wonderful Alice in Wonderland experience! When she ""dives into the rabbit hole"" she begins to watch her life unravel and begins to learn about how the world of quantum mechanics creates our own perception of our lives. Matlin's character, Amanda, is challenged to think about life's most challenging questions: What is reality? What is my life about? What are relationships? What is reality? What is consciousness? These are just a few of the very deep, challenging questions that is encountered throughout the movie!Throughout the movie, there are several interviews with quantum physic experts and New Age authors including JZ Knight, a mystic who has been known to channel a 35,000 year old ancient sage called Ramtha, Will Arntz, Betsy Chasse, Mark Vicente, Marlee Matlin, John Ross Bowie, Elaine Hendrix, and Robert Bailey Jr. This movie is inspiring and thoughtful! It really does make you think about how much control we have over our own ""reality"" and how much we can actually change that ""reality"" by changing our way of thinking!

I thought it curious that we didn't find out who the interviewees are until the end of the movie.  Most of them, it turns out, are scientists--MDs and PhDs--or academics of some sort, witheither degrees from or positions at prestigious universities.But one of them is some porcine blonde who, it turns out, claims to be channeling a 35,000 year old spirit from Atlantis named Ramtha, who sees a deep metaphysical significance in the fact that men get erections merely from thinking of nekkid women (really!),  and keeps saying ""You are God.""  This is supposed to be some sort of paradigm shift.  Yeah, paradigm shift my bleep.So naturally I'm thinking ""What the bleep?""  I was already thinking this when the filmmakers started introducing a strong anti-organized religion smear into the flick, which seemed completely gratuitous and out of place.  So I go to Amazon, and read some of the reviews--people love it, or hate because of the whole Ramtha element (a pretty good reason, in my opinion).  I notice on the DVD page, though, that you can buy it bundled with a DVD called ""Ramtha--Create Your Day.""  Well, one of the guys who appeared in the movie, a chiropractor, kept talking about creating his day.  Seemed like a helluva coincidence.So I go the Create Your Day DVD page, and it turns out that the director of THIS dvd co-directed the What the Bleep flick.  So clearly there is something  fishy going on here.  So I startwondering more about this Ramtha chick, and google it up.  Sure enough, there is a Ramtha School of Enlightenment, which naturally sells all sorts of stuff, including membership and retreats and enlightenment.  So it appears as if this movie is some sort of cult propaganda that was slickly marketed, and which a lot of people fell for.  Even, it seem, credible scientists, and actors like Marlee Matlin and Barry Newman.It's an enjoyable enough movie, I guess, but the fact that these Ramtha-ites, or whatever the hell they call themselves, are trying to pull a fast one on us, is annoying, to say the least.  I have no way of judging how valid the science is as it is presented in this movie, but with Ramtha raising his (her?) ugly head all over the place, I can't help but have my doubts.  Okay, so I admit it, I'm prejudiced against Atlantisians.  Even the decent ones usually have shady relatives.  I especially don't trust the ones over 30,000.I will say this, though:  Seeing this movie has inspired me to start my own cult.  There seems to be good money in it (check out the Ramtha website if you doubt this).  Whom should I channel, though?  A ditchdigger from Victorian London?  An extra-terrestrial from the planet Org?

Certainly quantum physics is interesting and evolution proceeded from the atomic level up, so the possibility of quantum effects on biological structures is not out of the question.

OK, good sex is good, but if we could see into the future using it, then there would be brothels next to every Wall Street trader's firm.As other readers have pointed out, this JZ Knight ""Ramtha"" character also leads one to question just how serious any of this is, although I don't have a problem with just evaluating the movie on its own merits.

Check on the facts they give you and you'll find some are correct, others are kind of correct but presented in a context that overreaches their implications, and there are just some bogus claims such as the water crystals that change shape based upon positive/negative thoughts (noone has been able to reproduce these experiments).",3,A pinch of truth mixed with half-truths and a few lies thrown in for good measure,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,1380,"['liked', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'goal', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'spirituality', 'not', 'necessarily', 'religion', 'science', 'Certainly', 'quantum', 'physics', 'interesting', 'evolution', 'proceeded', 'atomic', 'level', 'up', 'possibility', 'quantum', 'effects', 'biological', 'structures', 'not', 'question', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'choose', 'mix', 'fact', 'fiction', 'especially', 'when', 'fact', 'first', 'lull', 'false', 'sense', 'security', 'movie', 'real', 'then', 'whack', 'nutty', 'ideas', 'Sex', 'way', 'seeing', 'future', 'OK', 'good', 'sex', 'good', 'could', 'see', 'future', 'using', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'brothels', 'Wall', 'Street', 'trader', 'firm.As', 'other', 'readers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'JZ', 'Knight', 'Ramtha', 'character', 'also', 'one', 'question', 'just', 'how', 'serious', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'just', 'evaluating', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'summary', 'thought-provoking', 'enough', 'be', 'view', 'PLEASE', 'be', 'critical', 'everything', 'say', 'Check', 'facts', 'give', ""'ll"", 'find', 'are', 'correct', 'others', 'are', 'kind', 'correct', 'presented', 'context', 'implications', 'are', 'just', 'bogus', 'claims', 'such', 'water', 'crystals', 'change', 'shape', 'based', 'positive/negative', 'thoughts', 'noone', 'been', 'able', 'reproduce', 'experiments']",N/A

192783,A25JH6CO4DVINS,1582704414,Junglies,"[9, 10]","I am afraid that I will probably burst a few people's bubbles with this review but there you go.Once the movie had begun I was reminded of the Tao of Physics, a well written book of a few years ago which created a bit of a stir by suggesting that physics had gone from a hard science to more of an art due to the integration of uncertainty into the philosophical ethos and that the science was becoming akin to mysticism.I have found that work on uncertainty and theories of chaos have created some interesting areas but the incorporation into mystic and so-called new age ideas do not work for me.The areas of the movie that deal with quantum mechanics are a good way to bring these complex models to the awareness of the general public and for those I have nothing but applause.What I find disturbing is the way the film reaches out into other areas like emotional states and health and makes links which are hjust not there. I believe that a good mental attitude is a good factor in living one's life and an aid to recovery from illeness or surgery and no-one can deny the power of the will to live. However, as Karl Popper famously observed: a theory that explains everything, explains nothing.  It strikes me then that this film is an attempt to link a particularly comple notion to areas beyond which it is meant to apply in some sort of Hippiesque mythology as some sort of panacea to all of the ills of the world.I am afraid that we have a long way to go, socially and technologically , before we can live off the land with enough food to feed everyone and when disease has been vanquished. Those things are probably more capable of being achieved than curing the human tendency towards violence and imperialism.There are some great aspects to this movie, the inclusion of a deaf actor being the greatest in my humble opinion. Special effects are interesting and having the variety of speakers commenting throughout is impressive although I would have liked to have known who they worth.Worth a watch to learn something?

192784,ABUHG0870LEW4,1582704414,Just_Radar,"[16, 36]","I watched this movie at least two or three times as a part of my college education.  I have also sat through discussion groups regarding the content - both pro and con.Two-thirds of this movie was great!  The explanation of quantum physics was right on the money.  The illustrations through both graphics and story helped simplify the concepts more clearly.  The third part was the application of quantum physics to our life as seen through the eyes of mystics and disgruntled ex-catholics.  I will not attack these people nor their beliefs, however, be it known that I believe many of their statements were unscientific and, at times, contradictory.  At one point, a statement is repeated twice, ""There is no God.  There is no God.""  A moment later, it is followed by the statement, ""You are God.""  First, the Bible does say, ""The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God..."" (Psalm 14:1; 53:1).  Second, the logic of this comment would be...if there is no God, and you are God, then there is no ""You"" - you don't exist.  Third, if one were to claim to be God, remember that the Bible said that Satan wanted to be in place of the one true God as well (Isaiah 14:12-15).  Remember the deception that he used to deceive Eve in the Garden with the promise of faux deity (Genesis 3:1, 4-5, 14-15).  I don't believe that the mystics were intending evil toward anyone.  However, I do believe that they may have suffered ills at the hand of ""religion"" in previous years and have since inadvertantly accepted misinformation.If you want great information regarding quantum physics, two-thirds of this movie is verifiable through not only MIT, Einstein, and other great scientific sources, but the scientific explanations are quantifiable within the pages of Scripture.If you are seeking spiritual guidance or some meaning for your life outside of Christianity (or logical, scientific meaning for life in general), this movie will initially give you a warm, fuzzy feeling; but it will leave you empty and disillusioned if you really study it for truth.",3,Quantum Physics with a side of Bologna,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2047,"['watched', 'movie', 'least', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'part', 'college', 'education', 'have', 'also', 'sat', 'discussion', 'groups', 'regarding', 'content', 'pro', 'con.Two-thirds', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'explanation', 'quantum', 'physics', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'illustrations', 'graphics', 'story', 'helped', 'simplify', 'concepts', 'more', 'clearly', 'third', 'part', 'was', 'application', 'quantum', 'physics', 'life', 'seen', 'eyes', 'mystics', 'disgruntled', 'ex-catholics', 'will', 'not', 'attack', 'people', 'beliefs', 'however', 'be', 'believe', 'many', 'statements', 'were', 'unscientific', 'times', 'contradictory', 'one', 'point', 'statement', 'repeated', 'twice', 'God', 'God', 'moment', 'later', 'followed', 'statement', 'are', 'God', 'First', 'Bible', 'say', 'fool', 'hath', 'said', 'heart', 'God', 'Psalm', '14:1', '53:1', 'Second', 'logic', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'God', 'are', 'God', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Third', 'one', 'were', 'claim', 'be', 'God', 'remember', 'Bible', 'said', 'Satan', 'wanted', 'be', 'place', 'one', 'true', 'God', 'as', 'well', 'Isaiah', '14:12-15', 'Remember', 'deception', 'used', 'deceive', 'Eve', 'Garden', 'promise', 'faux', 'deity', 'Genesis', '3:1', '4-5', '14-15', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'mystics', 'were', 'intending', 'evil', 'anyone', 'However', 'do', 'believe', 'may', 'have', 'suffered', 'ills', 'hand', 'religion', 'previous', 'years', 'have', 'inadvertantly', 'accepted', 'misinformation.If', 'want', 'great', 'information', 'regarding', 'quantum', 'physics', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'verifiable', 'not', 'only', 'MIT', 'Einstein', 'other', 'great', 'scientific', 'sources', 'scientific', 'explanations', 'are', 'quantifiable', 'pages', 'Scripture.If', 'are', 'seeking', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'meaning', 'life', 'Christianity', 'logical', 'scientific', 'meaning', 'life', 'general', 'movie', 'will', 'initially', 'give', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'will', 'leave', 'empty', 'disillusioned', 'really', 'study', 'truth']",N/A
192785,A3DL686B8JEM8A,1582704414,"JWK ""jwk""","[0, 0]","This movie was recommended to me by several people.  I had no hopes, no expectations as to what the movie was about, though it was hinted to me that quantum physics was the basis.  I'm a chiropractic student and quantum physics is often discussed, as Q Phys (of sorts) along with standard science as the basis of what I'll be doing, so I gave the movie a try.  I was surprised from the beginning at how little the movie had to do with actual science in conjunction with Q Phys, but that was fine; people can believe what they believe, as long as I am allowed the same freedom.  Understand that the views given in the movie are not the whole scope of Q Phys, but rather an opinion mixed with it.  This is evident from the interviewees not able to agree on the same topic.  Again, nothing is wrong with a little debate, especially in such a controversial topic.What bothers me the most about the movie is the absolute obsession with the ""I,"" the ""self.""  So much emphasis is put on the self, that they go so far as to say matter is scattered until you pay attention to it.  Nothing is really there unless you imagine it.  The boy bouncing the ball is a good example.  It shows several possibilities of where the ball could be when the woman is faced away from it, and not until she faces it does the ball appear in the boys hand.  Is there a problem with this?  Yes.  Saying this is saying we are the center of the universe.  They have no problem with this notion, going so far as to say we are God, creating and destroying where we will.  But the movement of objects, like the projectile of the basketball is said to only come from what thoughts we create and the influence of others on us.If you performed an experiment on this concept, theoretically, you could put a baby in captivity on an island by himself, and he could ""experience"" the ball moving in ways the rest of us don't imagine, like bouncing once, then being absorbed by the sky, or erratically moving right to left as it bounces, or not bouncing at all.  Would the child experience this?  Q Phys says yes!  It also brings up chemistry (at a time it is convenient for the movie) to illistrate that the woman being hurt by the ball being thrown at her is impossible, as it is only electrons interacting, and the ball never touches her.  I'll remember this excuse the next time I have the urge to punch a quantum physicist in the face.  After all Newton's third law of motion says what we hit hits us back with equal force in the opposite direction.The only experiment the movie is willing to produce (or able to, depending on your level of suspicion), is the photographs of water droplets changed by the positive or negative thinking of the experimentor.  Next time you watch the movie, notice the lighting on each of the photos; a pretty blue on the positive thoughts, and an ugly yellow-green on the ""I'm sick of you"" drop.  If there was no tampering of the experiment (which is never discussed, nor is it discussed if the experiment is peer reviewed) and the droplets are so drastically different, why would they need to enhance the effects?Also, lots of cheerleading is given to the lifestyle of Q Phys, without a lot of examples of what the follower can do or act that is different than those of us unbelievers.  They mention seeing the future, going backward through time, and other amazing concepts.  But as well versed as these people are in the language of Q Phys, none of them can do these things.  Well, they're working toward doing those things, right?  What about children who don't have thought limits like adults do?  The first time the baby falls off the couch, wouldn't it stand to their reason that he could fall... up?  What about objects without a soul or thinking or an innate intelligence?  Couldn't they defy gravity or other man-made laws?  Oh, they do, but we can't see them unless we change how we think.  This circular logic is Q Phys's saftey net.Now don't get me wrong.  There is much good in what is being taught, like thinking positively, ""we create the world around us by our attitude,"" and much of what we do is self-fulfilling... all these things are correct in my opinion.  But they act like these things are revelatory.  Much of this logic has been taught for thousands of years, and many by the very thing Q Phys detest the most; organized religion.  We'll get to that in a minute.  The hormones of the body really DO go to the cells that are expecting a certain emotion to feel validated.  Thus, if I consider myself a victim, I won't feel whole until something bad happens, then I can say, ""See?!  It ALWAYS happens to ME!""  I know because I've thought this way; I wasn't happy unless I was miserable.  Likewise, neurons of the brain really DO travel in a pattern of habit.  So if I'm confronted with a situation I'm used to failing in, I have a difficult time imagining myself succeeding.  And yes, often times our minds can confuse its past with the present andsee ourselves in situations that we have attatched a strong emotion to.  These concepts are very beneficial for everyone.  I may disagree with about half of the movie (maybe more :), but I honestly think this knowledge should be taught to young and old.  ""My negativity will stop when I stop justifying it.""  ""If you can dream it, you can do it.""  ""Success, happiness, and love are determined by my attitude.""  Etc, etc, etc.  This is the good part of the movie.And the bad?  Their take on religion.  Now even with that sentence I just typed, you as the reader have already formulated an opinion on what I'm going to say before you even read it.  Try not to do it.  Let's be objective about what the movie says and what it does.  First, just before religion comes up as a topic, it is said that there is a difference between trulely thinking positively and having a positive thought wrapped around a large ball of negativity.  Fair enough.  Then they go on a mini tirade about the follies of organized religion and how they get everything wrong and how they fail to teach the true nature of God and.... whoa, whoa, wait a minute!  Didn't you just say there's danger in thinking negatively?  You mean you can talk about it, but not feel it for something so prevalent in the human experience??  Next, they admit that God is so big and mysterious that he can't be understood, and two minutes later they're tlaking about how a God so perfect isn't concerned with concepts like right and wrong...  Is this not a contradiction?""God must be greater than the greatest of human weaknesses and, indeed, the greatest of human skill. God must even transcend our most remarkable-to emulate nature in its absolute splendor. How can any man or woman sin against such greatness of mind? How can one little carbon unit on Earth-in the backwaters of the Milky Way, the boondocks-betray God almighty? That is impossible.""  Why is it impossible?  Because YOU as a person can't comprehend anything else?  Because you tried this way of thinking and it didn't work for YOU, so it must not work for anyone?  The logic is if God created us, we can't go against him.  Think about that the next time your child disobeys you.  Then tell me it's impossible.  I made myself a sandwhich today, but it didn't teach me anatomy.  ""The height of arrogance is the height of control of those who create God in their own image.""  Oh, our short sightedness.  When this woman says this, she can't see she's doing the exact thing she's condemning.  She creates God to fit HER mold, her way of thinking.Lastly, religion isn't even presented as an OPTION.  This is the fault of som much of this new-agey, hippie thinking.  They say ""think for yourself, don't let others decide for you,"" but what if I CHOOSE religion.  Religion doesn't require me to live a certain way, or think a certain way, or aspire to be a certain way.  I require that of myself.  Religion happens to be MY model for how I can obtain MY happiness, satisfaction, and love.  Again, a contradiction:  ""There's no right and wrong.  Only emtion.""  And as she explains this concept, she is saying that organized religion is wrong.  ""But I thought there was no right or wrong.""  ""There isn't.""  ""Okay.  I'm going to Church now.""  ""Don't do that.  That religion is wrong.""  ""Wait I'm confused.""  If you really want to let people make their own decisions and create their own reality, then let them do it.The last part of the movie shows the heroin thinking positively about herself, writing positive messages on her body, and finding happiness.  As she walks down the street she sees the church again, and it is reiterated where religions get it ""wrong.""  Somehow, they connect feeling negative about life and religion.  As a firm advocate of ""All religions are not created equal,"" I can tell you if ANY religion makes you think negatively about yourself, you are in the wrong one.Overall:  The movie makes some nice points, some bad ones, and some obvious ones.  I could discuss them more at length, and would be willing to do so via e-mail.  Feel free.  The movie is at best good, but inconsistent.  At worst, hypocritical, self-serving, and intollerant.  It may be a nice way to reaffirm what you already believe.  5 out of 10.",3,Man's tireless need to recreate the wheel  **1/2,1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,9215,"['movie', 'was', 'recommended',

It's that type of movie.  You find yourself really focusing on something said in the movie that gets you thinking and then you miss the next couple of things said...so when you watch it again, you notice something new.This is definitely not your typical movie.  It is loosely about a photographer, Amanda (played by Marlee Matlin), who is disillusioned primarily due to an unfaithful ex-husband.  She is taking anxiety pills just to get through the day.  As the movie progresses, she begins to question reality as she goes ""down the rabbit hole"" and discovers the endless possibilities in life.  At one point, in a train station, she is looking at photographs of the impact thoughts have on water.  A man walks up to her and says, ""If thoughts have that effect on water, imagine what effect they have on us.""  Very thought-provoking stuff!Seamlessly integrated into the movie are appearances by various doctors, scientists, professors, authors, and other believers in quantum physics who explain how they think reality works.One of my favorite parts is when Joe Dispenza explains how he creates his day each morning.  He notes that by focusing on our intentions for each day, we're more likely to create the kind of day (and ultimately life) we want, rather than just being buffeted around by whatever shows up.There are a lot of other great points made by the contributors to the film, too.  For instance, one comment made is that if we continously experience the same emotions over and over and never build on them, then we're caught in the same pattern of stimulus response.  Nothing changes in our lives because we're trapped in the same thinking/feeling response.Another comment, made by Fred Wolf is that ""there is no 'out there' out there, independent of what's going on ""in here.""The thing I like best about this movie is that it demonstrates that reality isn't just something that happens to us; it is something we can co-create (with God) based on our thoughts and beliefs.

During Matlin's journey through the film she is alternately guided, challenged and accompanied by various people who willy-nilly act as her instructors.The premise is fundamentally simple: Essentially, the universe contains far more information than we can possibly ever assimilate. It is said that a human being receives 400,000,000,000 bits of information every second, and that only 2000 become part of our ""reality."" The 2000 tend to be the most self-serving and expected items in our environment, leading us to believe in the permanence of what we see. However, as Quantum Physics shows, reality is an ultimately malleable substance in which potentialities trump set-pieces, and it is up to the observer to determine what he or she sees from moment to moment. In turn, these decisions influence our reactions, which change the structures of our brains, which alters the biochemical composition of our proteins, enzymes and neurotransmitters, which impacts each of our cells. Thus, if we are happy, each cell is happy; if we are angry, each cell is angry. Behavior and personality are determined in part therefore, by what has come before. Our neural nets and our cells are predisposed to react to those chemical structures most comfortably, easily and quickly recognized. This recognition is a form of addiction: We can be addicted to happiness in much the same way as we can be addicted to heroin or overeating. In short, changing your mind involves literally CHANGING your mind.All of this is illustrated by some very amusing graphics in which cells and enzymes dance, fight and laugh amongst themselves, altering the behavior of the poor, unaware people they belong to. Matlin can see this, and though she is overwhelmed at times by the energies whirling around her, she, the film's Everywoman, becomes the ultimate beneficiary of the lessons taught.Central to the film are the discoveries of Masuro Emoto, who has proven how the spoken (or even written) word can change the crystalline structure of water. This is visually depicted in the film, as we are shown the difference between ""The Chi of Love"" and ""I Hate You And I Want To Kill You,"" the first a graceful lotus-like image, the second an oily chaotic abstract. Emoto points out that this as true in the human body (90%+ made up of water) as it is in a plastic tumbler, a stunning example of how thought can change the substances around us that we otherwise perceive as separate. For more on this subject, the reader is referred to Emoto's series MESSAGES FROM WATER.Various Doctoral talking heads comment on such topics as subatomic particles, the hypothalamus, H2O, and God.

I remember in graduate school that if you went to the university's Physics department, where a number of Nobelists were in residence, the theoreticians lectured that it was impossible for events at the subatomic level to affect the superatomic level.  Newton was right, and classical mechanics still carried the day- I think several famous physicists had put together a credible 'interpretation' of Bell's Inequality in line with their own dogma, and that won their case.  But if you went across the hall to the Chemistry department, they would tell you those guys were dead wrong.  At the practical end, `the world of the tiny' appeared to cross that supposed `unbridgeable' gap all the time.  So what we ultimately are left with today is a paradox where theorists won't try to explain something they can't predict because it's not in their model, while the practical people have evidence in their hands that can be measured and repeated, but not explained.  I ran across a glaring example of this paradox when Scientific American published a review of this film in the Skeptic's column.  The columnist very smugly trounced it as `pseudoscience', citing the same dogma and a few other things.  But further on in the magazine, there was a feature article about how quantum technologies were finally becoming more available and already giving us better home electronics than we ever imagined....  WHAT?!?!  You Mean, we ALREADY have MACHINES in our HOMES that ACTUALLY WORK AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL?!?!?!  The short answer is yes you do, for a long time now, several, your DVD player being one...even though theoretical dogma says it's impossibile.  So Folks, you can't have it both ways.  Practical evidence is leaning towards some holes in the 'unbridgeable gap' proposition.  The film does make a number of conceptual leaps about what all this means, but no one, not even your dear professor Dr. Aunt Mildred, Ph.D., can tell you where scientific investigation is going in this field with any certainty.  So the film makers filled in the blanks, just like film makers have done and will continue to ad infinitum.  After all, it's their money.If that's true, then where IS science going?  I'll give you a hint: the brain also works at the subatomic level, which is where the metaphysical angle comes back into play.  That's why the film interviews people from a spectrum of disciplines, as they all seem to be converging in, of all places, your brain.  It is here that researchers are seeing the most extraordinary and unexplainable events at the quantum level affecting a larger world, namely your body.  If they are right, the implications are staggering.  If they are right, it means something of the utmost importance to everyone, in every possible way.Many reviewers have cast aspersions on the credibility of the interview subjects in order to disparage the film indirectly.  This is both ill-advised and undeserved.  The interview subjects include scientific researchers, doctors, theologians, one self-purported mystic and a chiropractor.  My favorite interviewee in the film is Dr. Candace Pert, who happens to be one of the most celebrated researchers of recent times whose discovery of the opiate receptor in the early `80's marked a watershed in brain science.  Her original paper announcing that discovery has the distinction of being one of the most cited pieces of research in scientific history.  Her subsequent research career has been long, highly respected and copiously published.  If she thinks there is a brain/quantum connection worth studying, then there probably is.  Only an idiot or an ignoramus would call her a ""pseudo-scientist"".  Most of the other scientist/participants are either near that level of accomplishment or more than well educated enough to form an opinion, which the viewer is free to accept or reject as they like.  Oddly enough, it seems that the inclusion of the chiropractor in this group upsets people more than anything else, if reviews are any guide.  Why is that?  Are they bad, or what?  Is there something going on about chiropractors that I haven't heard?!Is the film propaganda?  Of course, just like all works of art; show me a film that isn't.  Is it an infomercial for the ""Cult of Ramtha""?  I did not find that.  No one is going to jump out of the TV screen and make you join their church after you watch this film, nor will you be brainwashed into such an action.  Reviewers who suggest this (and many, many did) really have a problem.  It is true that the film pushes a certain philosophical perspective, and this is bound to upset people who cling to a Newtonian, mechanistic world-view.  But to be fair, those same people don't appear to object to agenda-pushing in other films, which they should do if only from a standpoint of ethics.  Either that, or just admit their prejudices as we can all see them anyway.  It's already obvious they don't like chiropractors.I'm giving it only 4 stars because I think the writing could have been a bit better.",4,"My, How They Do Go On!",1150588800,"06 18,

Unlike other reviewer's statements, this movie does NOT imply anything about the nature of quantum physics that is not true.

I know for a fact that many psychologists, philosophers, and physicists have been looking in this same direction for some time.The key words to remember from this movie are ""paradigm shift"" ... and this movie asks us to consider quite a large one: A psychological paradigm shift that results at a quantum level.  To some less-flexible minds, this is asking too much.However, at no time does this movie tell you how to achieve anything nor does it detatch any truth from science itself, but instead it asks more fundamental human questions.If you watch Nova's The Elegant Universe and then watch this movie ... you may find yourself feeling a bit like the natives who couldn't see Columbus' fleet ... simply because their minds had no frame of reference for them.

I told a lot of my friends about it; and the second time I went there were seven of us in the audience, six of whom I knew.  So this was not well publicized in our small city, but still drew people to it.  Had it played more than a week, perhaps we'd have had a dozen!  I recently saw a used copy and decided to add it to my collection.I really enjoyed this docu-drama.  I found the use of actors, scientists and animation to have enough diversity to keep my attention.  It was both informative and entertaining.  Marlee Matlin won an Oscar & Golden Globe for ""Children of a Lesser God"" in 1986.  She does good work as Amanda who has come out of a marriage with an unfaithful husband and chip on her shoulder.  Her houseguest Jennifer is played by the perky Elaine Hendrix, who gets to foot paint.  I also thought John Ross Bowie as Eliot that Amanda meets while she photographs a wedding did a nice job.The subject matter intrigues me.  As I've thought about this film, I keep considering how our expectations color our perceptions.  If you ever heard a record by Harry Nilsson calledThe Point! (Deluxe Packaging), I keep recalling, ""You see what you want to see; and you hear what you want to hear.""  In much that same way, if we work to make our thinking positive, I believe we perceive the positive aspects of things happening around us and draw more positive things to us.  I particularly was impressed when I watched the DVD how one scientist planned his day.  I've been trying to work with this idea, thinking about being positive and loving with the people with whom I'm in contact, even praying for those where disagreements seem to persist.  My experience is that when I do this, I have a better day!I was also very impressed inThe Urantia Bookhow it says that thoughts are things.  We know although it's not able to be seen, air is a thing.  For those of us living in the hurricane belt, we know air (wind) can be destructive.  In the same way, I think this film illustrates the chemical counterparts of thought in the brain.  Just like air can be positive and life-giving or destructive and life-taking, I believe the consequences of thought can also be similar.  Yet few work to seriously address the quality of their thinking.When I watch this film, I don't perceive it as having to believe everything in it before I can get something from it.  Parts of it have relevance to me, particularly I'm in a bit different place in 2008 than I was when the film came out in 2004.  So I recommend this film.

(THAT'S HOW MUCH I ENJOYED IT.)I remember reading reviews the first time I ordered it.  I was shocked and amazed by those who gave it low ratings, and would justify that rating by attacking and tearing apart minutiae details used to illustrate an idea being presented, (e.g., the story of the Native Americans being unable to see the Spanish ships approaching the coast, etc.)  Some of the reviews included what seemed to be an attempt at character assassination of some of the spokespersons in the movie.My first viewing was the theatrical release version - to which I reacted with awe and wonder.  Then, I watched the hyper-extended version - MORE awe and wonder.  It seemed as if most of the negative reviews were based mostly on the theatrical released version.  Many of the criticisms revolved around an idea that the film was somehow attempting to indoctrinate its viewers to some religion or cult.My opinion - nothing could be further from the truth about this film.  If anything, many of the discussions and scenes presented actually were highly critical of traditional religions and the way they are typically practiced, pointing out how most religions fall very short of providing any real meaning or insight to its followers.  There was ABSOLUTELY NO SINGLE RELIGION OR SPIRITUALITY THAT WAS PRESENTED, IN BOTH VERSIONS OF THE MOVIE, THAT WAS PROMOTED AS THE END-ALL AND BE-ALL TO RELIGION OR SPIRITUALITY. If anything, this movie encouraged the viewer to question religion.Interwoven with the above, the movie gave the viewer a crash course in quantum mechanics to bring one up to speed on our current understanding, and did this using various examples, including a clever cartoon about Professor Quantum in ""Quantum World"", helping the layperson to understand its basic principles.  It also reviewed some quandaries in physics, such as ""reversal-time symmetry"" that still baffle physicists today.  I felt it did a great job in explaining the history of Dualism, and how it split human understanding of our universe into the ""seen"" and ""unseen"", or clock-work mechanistic world versus a spiritual world.And finally, the main theme of the movie is presented, i.e., that our knowledge of physics and the physical world actually does allow for Free Will and spirituality, and that the world is not as mechanistic, or deterministic, as it may seem.  In the end, the movie leaves the viewer feeling more empowered, spiritual, and self-confident in one's own consciousness than previously, but without any sense of being manipulated into one religion or another.",5,Spirit & Science Interface,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,2681,"['actually', 'second', 'copy', 'one', 'disc', 'first', 'DVD', 'set', 'became', 'damaged', 'therefore', 'ordered', 'again', 'HOW', 'MUCH', 'ENJOYED', 'IT', 'remember', 'reading', 'reviews', 'first', 'time', 'ordered', 'was', 'shocked', 'amazed', 'who', 'gave', 'low', 'ratings', 'would', 'justify', 'rating', 'attacking', 'tearing', 'apart', 'minutiae', 'details', 'used', 'illustrate', 'idea', 'being', 'presented', 'e.g.', 'story', 'Native', 'Americans', 'being', 'unable', 'see', 'Spanish', 'ships', 'approaching', 'coast', 'etc', 'reviews', 'included', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'attempt', 'character', 'assassination', 'spokespersons', 'movie.My', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'version', 'reacted', 'awe', 'wonder', 'Then', 'watched', 'hyper-extended', 'version', 'MORE', 'awe', 'wonder', 'seemed', 'most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'were', 'based', 'mostly', 'theatrical', 'released', 'version', 'Many', 'criticisms', 'revolved', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'somehow', 'attempting', 'indoctrinate', 'viewers', 'religion', 'cult.My', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'film', 'anything', 'many', 'discussions', 'scenes', 'presented', 'actually', 'were', 'highly', 'critical', 'traditional', 'religions', 'way', 'are', 'typically', 'practiced', 'pointing', 'out', 'how', 'most', 'religions', 'fall', 'very', 'short', 'providing', 'real', 'meaning', 'insight', 'followers', 'was', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NO', 'SINGLE', 'RELIGION', 'OR', 'SPIRITUALITY', 'THAT', 'WAS', 'PRESENTED', 'IN', 'BOTH', 'VERSIONS', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'THAT', 'WAS', 'PROMOTED', 'THE', 'END-ALL', 'AND', 'BE-ALL', 'TO', 'RELIGION', 'OR', 'SPIRITUALITY', 'anything', 'movie', 'encouraged', 'viewer', 'question', 'religion.Interwoven', 'above', 'movie', 'gave', 'viewer', 'crash', 'course', 'quantum', 'mechanics', 'bring', 'one', 'up', 'speed', 'current', 'understanding', 'did', 'using', 'various', 'examples', 'including', 'clever', 'cartoon', 'Professor', 'Quantum', 'Quantum', 'World', 'helping', 'layperson', 'understand', 'basic', 'principles', 'also', 'reviewed', 'quandaries', 'physics', 'such', 'reversal-time', 'symmetry', 'still', 'physicists', 'today', 'felt', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'explaining', 'history', 'Dualism', 'how', 'split', 'human', 'understanding', 'universe', 'seen', 'unseen', 'clock-work', 'mechanistic', 'world', 'spiritual', 'world.And', 'finally', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'presented', 'i.e.', 'knowledge', 'physics', 'physical', 'world', 'actually', 'allow', 'Free', 'Will', 'spirituality', 'world', 'not', 'mechanistic', 'deterministic', 'may', 'seem', 'end', 'movie', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'more', 'empowered', 'spiritual', 'self-confident', 'one', 'own', 'consciousness', 'previously', 'sense', 'being', 'manipulated', 'one', 'religion']",N/A
192806,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,1582704414,Lleu Christopher,"[6, 10]","This is a movie that you should only see if you are open to things like channelling, a mystical interpretation of quantum physics or ideas such as ""the universe is a hologram."" If you are a diehard materialist or religious monotheist, What The Bleep is not going to change your mind about anything. On the other hand, if you already believe in such ""new age"" ideas or are at least open to them, this is an interesting, informative and mostly entertaining film. The style of mixing documentary and fictional drama was done fairly well, though at times the jumping around is a little distracting.The scientists interviewed for the film, along with J.Z. Knight (who channels the entity known as Ramtha and was introduced to the public something like 20 years ago by Shirley Maclaine) present these ideas in an accessible way. Of course, you can't expect to learn everything there is to know about a subject in a 100 minute film, but  viewers are given lots of clues about where to search for further information.Marlee Matlin stars in the dramatic episodes, and she was a good choice. Her character is a troubled, depressed and skeptical person who is gradually transformed by the idea that people create their own reality. What the Bleep does a good job of presenting a summary of a psychological/scientific/spiritual paradigm that has been steadily growing on the fringes of mainstream culture for the past few decades. While some of the conclusions drawn by the people interviewed are certainly debatable, many of the basic principles related to physics are difficult to argue with. You may not believe that we really create our own reality, but the fact is that the rationalist/materialist (not to mention fundamentalist religious) models that peaked in the 19th Century are all but obsolete and we definitely need to explore the new terrain.

She said it ""blew her mind.""  So I watched it.  I was disappointed.  The film does not live up to its promise to use Quantum Physics to explore life as we know it.  It starts out that way, but changes to a lecture on simple biology.  ""Mind-blowing"" special effects consist of a Robert Palmer ""lust"" cell and his backup of female cells singing ""Addicted to Love.""Many people are interviewed throughout the film, which combines Discovery Channel-type expert interviewing with the fictional story of a deaf, female photographer (Marlee Matlin) dependent on anti-anxiety medication who is bitter about life.  These people are not identified until the end credits roll.  I thought they were actors like Matlin.  It would have been much more helpful to include at least name and career.What I liked about Bleep is the statements that we hold ourselves back from developing our full potential because we cling to the past, and to chemical addictions related to past events.  I liked the change that Matlin undergoes, from self-loathing to self-love.  And that is also what I did not like about the film.  The film is self-indulgent and will make people even more selfish.  Not only, says Bleep, are you the center of your universe, but you can control your environment and the people in it.  This world is full of self-centered people only out for themselves.  If we thought of others, it would be a much better place.What not to take seriously is Ramtha, the Sylvia Browne-like spiritual guru who says that we are God, that it is arrogant to think that we could sin against God.  I beg your pardon, but it is arrogant to think that we are God when we did not create the Earth and all the people and creatures in it.  She says that all our technological achievements are evidence that we are god.  Well, until we can make - not clone - a living being as complicated as a human - I will worship God and consider myself smaller than him.  Yes, I am creative.

You really don't need over 2 and  hours of the same thing over and over.  There is no basic premise other than the world around you is not what it seems and you can create your own reality.  The film takes this topic and spins it in a hundred different possible directions through the use of Marlee Matlin as the goofy curmudgeon of a photographer spliced into a world of meta-physics while a dozen talking heads of worldly experience (doctors, philosophers, engineers, biologists, physicists, spiritualists, etc.) interject what their beliefs are about every day life.Getting past the long 3-DVD edition, this film does offer some interesting insight into what we see, believe, interpret, recognize, rationalize and live.  There are no limits other than your imagination.  Everything is perspective and perspective is everything.  Can you fit a million little worlds on the head of a pin?  Are we unable to grasp a completely different outer world that we are simply a minute part of?  Can we decide what our day will be like?  Is there a God?  Why do things happen the way they do?  Can we change our lives?  These are just a few of the hundreds of questions tossed about - this film is a nicely choreographed lesson in Philosophy and Quantum physics.  Of course, it is `dumbed down' a bit to appeal to the masses and the commentators are highly respected, if unknown.  At times these `talking heads' can be amazingly acute and at other times, irritatingly hyper-positive!The film is definitely worthwhile to watch and to ask yourself these same questions.  I kept thinking that most of the jargon was simply the `power of positive thinking'.  Seriously, you can decide whether you are going to act one way or another - or - make it a great day or a lousy day.  It's mostly all choice.  I give the filmmakers and writers great credit for the way they managed to take what most people find as a `dry topic' and turn it into something palatable.

192819,A9JA0MI0GFQ39,1582704414,Mike Blaszczak,"[203, 320]","Over my vacation last year, I listened to an audio book of lectures by Richard Feynman called ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"". The lectures left me charged with passion about science. One of the most memorable portions of the lectures involved Feynman wondering why so few people saw the beauty of science deeply enough to use it in art.After all, there are many paintings of people or nature, showing their beauty. Why not tell the stories of scientists and their exciting discoveries? Why not show the beauty of mathematics in an interesting, fictional story?When I saw the posters for What the #$*! Do We Know (which I'll call WT#DWK for brevity), I was very excited. I thought it would be such a movie, that would demonstrate the passions we can feel around science. I hadn't heard of the title before, and didn't know the origin of the movie until I researched it after leaving.Before you spend time or money on it, you should know that the movie was directed by a bunch of new-agers who run a cult. J. Z. Knight runs ""Ramtha's School of Enlightment"" in Yelm, Washington. She claims to channel an ancient warrior from Lemuria (now present-day Monglia) who lived more than thirty thousand years ago.This woman believes and preaches falsehoods and executes irresponsible practices. Statements like: ""It's just a fact that we use less than a tenth of our brain,"" and stories of trusting her child's healthcare to a vision she had during an out of body experience are the brunt of her website.Had I this background before paying for my tickets, I would have been prepared. Instead, I had my lofty hopes for a science-focused movie and I was, instead, profoundly disappointed. This movie is absolute tripe.The first thing that struck me was the vast inductive leaps the movie made. The movie examines some simple observations, such as the behaviour of a molecule. And it inductively rides those into saying that people, after all, must behave the same way. No connection is made; no explanation for _why_ we should believe that people behave like molecules. We're just expected to believe it. The movie saddles up this fallacy and rides it into town; if people behave like molecules, then all laws of physics that apply to matter must have analogous laws which apply to people, right?Other phenomenon are treated as if they're unquestionable facts, as if they're every-day occurrences. Global conciousness, for example.Particles can't be in two places at once. Quantum physics tells us that we're sometimes not sure where they are, but current thinking tells us that matter only occupies one space at an instant.And so on.I really loved some of the anmiations and graphics, which showed physical phenomenon in a very lear and approachable way. Why not spend this kind of money on making graphics for students and teachers?This kind of inductive cultism scares the pants off of me. It was all I could do to not leave the theater; I tried to follow the movie and give it a chance, but I was vastly disappointed. I know that a lot of people believe that there's something more out there; I do too, sometimes. But the way this movie uses tangible science to justify such profoundly unsupported conclusions leaves me cold.Proof by analogy means nothing, and neither does this film.",1,Pure Bunk,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,3281,"['vacation', 'last', 'year', 'listened', 'audio', 'book', 'lectures', 'Richard', 'Feynman', 'called', 'Pleasure', 'Finding', 'Things', 'Out', 'lectures', 'left', 'charged', 'passion', 'science', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'portions', 'lectures', 'involved', 'Feynman', 'wondering', 'why', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'saw', 'beauty', 'science', 'deeply', 'enough', 'use', 'art.After', 'are', 'many', 'paintings', 'people', 'nature', 'showing', 'beauty', 'Why', 'not', 'tell', 'stories', 'scientists', 'exciting', 'discoveries', 'Why', 'not', 'show', 'beauty', 'mathematics', 'interesting', 'fictional', 'story', 'When', 'saw', 'posters', 'What', '*', 'Do', 'Know', ""'ll"", 'call', 'WT', 'DWK', 'brevity', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'movie', 'would', 'demonstrate', 'passions', 'can', 'feel', 'science', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'title', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'origin', 'movie', 'researched', 'spend', 'time', 'money', 'should', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'bunch', 'new-agers', 'who', 'run', 'cult', 'J', 'Z.', 'Knight', 'Ramtha', 'School', 'Enlightment', 'Yelm', 'Washington', 'channel', 'ancient', 'warrior', 'Lemuria', 'now', 'present-day', 'Monglia', 'who', 'lived', 'more', 'thirty', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago.This', 'woman', 'preaches', 'falsehoods', 'irresponsible', 'practices', 'Statements', 'just', 'fact', 'use', 'less', 'tenth', 'brain', 'stories', 'trusting', 'child', 'healthcare', 'vision', 'had', 'body', 'experience', 'are', 'brunt', 'website.Had', 'background', 'paying', 'tickets', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prepared', 'Instead', 'had', 'lofty', 'hopes', 'science-focused', 'movie', 'was', 'instead', 'profoundly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'absolute', 'tripe.The', 'first', 'thing', 'struck', 'was', 'vast', 'inductive', 'movie', 'made', 'movie', 'simple', 'observations', 'such', 'behaviour', 'molecule', 'inductively', 'saying', 'people', 'must', 'behave', 'same', 'way', 'connection', 'made', 'explanation', '_why_', 'should', 'believe', 'people', 'behave', 'molecules', ""'re"", 'just', 'expected', 'believe', 'movie', 'up', 'fallacy', 'rides', 'town', 'people', 'behave', 'molecules', 'then', 'laws', 'physics', 'apply', 'matter', 'must', 'have', 'analogous', 'laws', 'apply', 'people', 'right', 'Other', 'phenomenon', 'are', 'treated', ""'re"", 'unquestionable', 'facts', ""'re"", 'every-day', 'occurrences', 'Global', 'conciousness', 'example.Particles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'two', 'places', 'once', 'Quantum', 'physics', ""'re"", 'sometimes', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'are', 'current', 'thinking', 'tells', 'matter', 'only', 'one', 'space', 'instant.And', 'so', 'on.I', 'really', 'loved', 'anmiations', 'graphics', 'showed', 'physical', 'phenomenon', 'very', 'lear', 'approachable', 'way', 'Why', 'not', 'spend', 'kind', 'money', 'making', 'graphics', 'students', 'teachers', 'kind', 'inductive', 'cultism', 'pants', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'not', 'leave', 'theater', 'tried', 'follow', 'movie', 'give', 'chance', 'was', 'vastly', 'disappointed', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'believe', 'something', 'more', 'there', 'do', 'too', 'sometimes', 'way', 'movie', 'tangible', 'science', 'justify', 'such', 'profoundly', 'unsupported', 'conclusions', 'cold.Proof', 'analogy', 'means', 'nothing', 'neither', 'film']",N/A

She seemed to me be a huckster. I wondered why, with all of the really solid spiritual teachers available, the filmmakers would choose her. The other talking heads were a bit uneven, but one or two seemed like they might be solid. Anyway, I saw the movie twice and then, because I still had doubts, I looked into the film a little more and found a few unsettling items:*Followers of JZ Knight made the film. They were apparently unconcerned that in the 1980s she had her students use copper to shield against aliens, that she had predicted a number of apocalyptic disasters which never occurred, that it can cost thousands to hear her talk (yes, I know that initial lectures are less expensive).*One of her former students says he quit working with her after finding her practicing her Ramtha voices. It didn't seem to me she had practiced them very well!*The psychiatrist studying physics, Jeffrey Satinover, has a book calling for attempting to cure homosexuals. He believes that they are ill. He lists Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as one of his heroes!*The Irish theologian in the film had to resign as president of his college as a result of a scandal.*Many of the ""scientists"" are lecturers at Knight's center.==> One of the few real scientists in the film, David Albert, has charged the filmmakers with carefully selecting bits of his hours of interview to present a point of view that is 180 degrees opposite of what he said. THINK ABOUT THIS. The filmmakers have, I believe, discredited themselves entirely through their misrepresentation of Dr. Albert's views. Why would they do this if they were really interested in the truth? &lt;==I really believe that intentions matter and that they shape our life. If you agree, please ask yourself, what could possibly be the intentions of filmmakers who distort the material provided in interviews? More importantly, what is the intention of JZ Knight in making up a story about channeling a 35,000 year old teacher from Atlantis?

However, I wanted to preview it first because the reviews were mixed.  I'm not a physicist but I'm trained in the sciences so I have a decent base of understanding to spot pure BS.Early in this film I thought it was interesting because it was laying out some of the strange discoveries that have occured in QM.  Anyone who has kept up with the field knows what these are and I don't think the film was misleading in that regard (when the scientists were talking).  However, as happens in a lot of places, the strange world of QM is taken as some kind of basis for how we ought to live our lives.In the ""second"" 1/2 of this film they launch into a really heavy handed attack on religion.  It is almost like this was two movies pasted together.  The first is about how strange QM are and the next was an attack on religion.  They seem to be trying to say that the first justifies the second when nothing could be further from the truth.  Note that I am not religious and don't have any particular love of organized religion.  However, I don't think it appropriate to attack religion with QM when there are so many other, and more appropriate, things to attack it with.Since I'm sure I've irritated both sides by now, you may vote me into oblivion.

But as  the movie progressed I had began to have a sinking filling that I was listening to some sort of pseudo scientific flimflam and worse yet cult mumbo jumbo.Then we get to ""Dr"" Masaru Emoto and his manipulation of water crystals through emotions, whom I have heard of before. I'm sorry but MR. Emoto's ""doctorate"" in alternative medicine from a highly questionable university does not make him the most credible of authorities. Nor does his ""experiments"" failure to observe empirical method help his case. His water test failed to meet double blind standards, repeatability or even impartial witnessing.But all this got me to thinking about everything else in the film. I did some research on the two other most suspicious aspects of the film the meditation study and a rather frightening women who I only later learned was named J Z Knight.The meditation study claimed a 18% reduction of crime in D.C. when psychics meditated on the issue. In the case of the study I discovered that the crime rate throughout the study was 15% higher then average despite the studies claim that the rate was reduced. The study is an example of just plain erroneous science and falsification of data.Before I get too what I later discovered was the heart of the film I wish to note that one of the scientists in the film, Dr. David Albert, has stated that through editing it was made to look like he endorsed these highly questionable claims, when he in fact did not.now on the the heart of the matter...Why did I look up J Z Knight you ask. Through out the movie she seemed out of place. A persons work can acutely alter the way they talk. Knight did not sound like a scientist. Scientists have a odd cautious and deliberate tone. Knight sounded confidant and overzealous in her claims, this was coupled with a more careful storyteller's gift for charismatic speech. In short, she sounded like one of those charlatans so often debunked by the James Randi institute. Sure enough at the end of the movie we discover she's a cult leader, well it's not said she's a cult leader but when you've become rich making highly dubious claims about channeling ancient warriors... well you get the point.A little research turns up that the films creators are member's of said cult as were many of the ""experts"".

Its also about time that science and spirituality join forces and transcend the age old conflict where the likes of Galileo, Martin Luther, Charles Darwin, and others disturb the religious order with their thought provoking questions that religion can't answer yet science strives towards.  This film presents many complex ideas in easy to understand language, using often humourous animation to illustrate their points (my personal favorite being the cells that are personified in a way similar to the 1990s Disney remake ""Flubber"").  I do agree with most of the ideas presented, most notably that what we think determines our outer reality.  For me, a profound moment while watching the film was seeing the animated illustration that if we change our thinking, we break the chain of thought from being built in our minds that our past experiences will be endlessly repeated.  They don't have to be, if we recognize it for what it is...a learning hurdle.  Until we move past it, we are doomed to repeat past experiences.  Amazingly simple.What I don't like about the film is that it looks like it was made by people with Attention Deficit Disorder for people with ADD.  There is too much ""busyness"" on the screen, and quick cuts from image to image in split seconds, which I found very distracting, as my attention can stay focused for a long time.  Such editing style made me antsy watching this film, and I couldn't relax.  The music accompaniment wasn't any better, as it was new agey trance music (the pop songs were smartly chosen, however), that sometimes played too loud to hear the person speaking, and distracting from what he/she was saying.So, for this film, I would say that the ideas presented and the intention of the filmmakers, I'd give 5 stars, but the presentation, I would give 2 stars.  I liked that Portland Oregon was the backdrop in the story segment, but I found the acting on the amateurish side.  The scenes at the wedding were the funniest bits in this film and great illustrations of the points they are trying to make with this film.  The rest of the acting parts were a bit lame for me, though I did love the final ten minutes of this film.I'm inclined to give this film a mediocre 3 stars, but what really makes this dvd worth seeing and possibly owning are the special features, which include an outstanding Q&A; session with the film's three directors at various discussion halls (though it only comes to 30 minutes, which I found too short), and interviews with the three directors and some cast members.  It's terrific to hear all the people's insights in how they came to make this film, and how this film evolved from the original conception, and what the filmmakers ""intention"" for this film is (to be seen by 100 million people worldwide, which I hope they succeed because our world really needs a serious shift in consciousness).  Watching all of that, all I can say is that I wanted to hear more about the ideas presented.  Perhaps a sequel might be in the future?  If there is, I certainly hope the filmmakers will make their next film less ""ADD"" for those whose attention span can focus on an image or idea for longer than 30 seconds, a minute, ten minutes.  There are people out there who don't need all the distractions and can take the message straight, without flashing lights and blowing whistles.",4,"Obviously, they know a ""bleeping"" lot!",1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,3513,"['Finally', 'documentary', 'intelligent', 'audience', 'asking', 'many', 'thought', 'provoking', 'questions', 'regarding', 'inner', 'reality', 'how', 'outer', 'world', 'also', 'time', 'science', 'spirituality', 'join', 'forces', 'transcend', 'age', 'old', 'conflict', 'where', 'likes', 'Galileo', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'Charles', 'Darwin', 'others', 'disturb', 'religious', 'order', 'thought', 'provoking', 'questions', 'religion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer', 'yet', 'science', 'strives', 'towards', 'film', 'many', 'complex', 'ideas', 'easy', 'understand', 'language', 'using', 'often', 'humourous', 'animation', 'illustrate', 'points', 'personal', 'favorite', 'being', 'cells', 'are', 'personified', 'way', 'similar', '1990s', 'Disney', 'remake', 'Flubber', 'do', 'agree', 'most', 'ideas', 'presented', 'most', 'notably', 'what', 'think', 'determines', 'outer', 'reality', 'profound', 'moment', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'seeing', 'animated', 'illustration', 'change', 'thinking', 'break', 'chain', 'thought', 'being', 'built', 'minds', 'past', 'experiences', 'will', 'be', 'endlessly', 'repeated', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'recognize', 'what', 'learning', 'hurdle', 'move', 'are', 'doomed', 'repeat', 'past', 'experiences', 'Amazingly', 'simple.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'people', 'Attention', 'Deficit', 'Disorder', 'people', 'ADD', 'too', 'much', 'busyness', 'screen', 'quick', 'cuts', 'image', 'image', 'split', 'seconds', 'found', 'very', 'distracting', 'attention', 'can', 'stay', 'focused', 'long', 'time', 'Such', 'editing', 'style', 'made', 'antsy', 'watching', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'relax', 'music', 'accompaniment', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'was', 'new', 'agey', 'trance', 'music', 'pop', 'songs', 'were', 'smartly', 'chosen', 'however', 'sometimes', 'played', 'too', 'loud', 'hear', 'person', 'speaking', 'distracting', 'what', 'he/she', 'was', 'saying.So', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'ideas', 'presented', 'intention', 'filmmakers', ""'d"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'presentation', 'would', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'liked', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'was', 'backdrop', 'story', 'segment', 'found', 'acting', 'amateurish', 'side', 'scenes', 'wedding', 'were', 'funniest', 'bits', 'film', 'great', 'illustrations', 'points', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'rest', 'acting', 'parts', 'were', 'bit', 'lame', 'did', 'love', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'give', 'film', 'mediocre', '3', 'stars', 'what', 'really', 'dvd', 'worth', 'seeing', 'possibly', 'owning', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'outstanding', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'film', 'three', 'directors', 'various', 'discussion', 'halls', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'found', 'too', 'short', 'interviews', 'three', 'directors', 'cast', 'members', 'terrific', 'hear', 'people', 'insights', 'how', 'came', 'make', 'film', 'how', 'film', 'evolved', 'original', 'conception', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'intention', 'film', 'be', 'seen', '100', 'million', 'people', 'worldwide', 'hope', 'succeed', 'world', 'really', 'serious', 'shift', 'consciousness', 'Watching', 'can', 'say', 'wanted', 'hear', 'more', 'ideas', 'presented', 'Perhaps', 'sequel', 'might', 'be', 'future', 'certainly', 'hope', 'filmmakers', 'will', 'make', 'next', 'film', 'less', 'ADD', 'attention', 'span', 'can', 'focus', 'image', 'idea', 'longer', '30', 'seconds', 'minute', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'distractions', 'can', 'take', 'message', 'straight', 'flashing', 'lights', 'blowing', 'whistles']",N/A

There are some questionable conclusions made during the course of the movie about such things as love, sex and God, to name a few. However, there is much in the movie that is entertaining and worthwhile, even for those of us who already know a bit about the subject matter. I didn't necessarily agree with every opinion offered in the movie, but where does it say i have to agree with every aspect of something to be able to enjoy it? There are very few books, movies etc that i have 100% agreed with, yet many i find interesting, thought-provoking, amusing etc.Many negative reviewers seem to be very put-out by the fact that most of the interviewees are not quantum physicists and yet have the gall to talk about quantum physics! Well, that is just elitism in my opinion. We live in a society of so-called ""experts"" and ""professionals"" in every field, from politicians to doctors, and the more specialized we get, the worse things are. We abdicate our personal responsibility to think about things for ourselves and teach ourselves about the world. We stop educating ourselves as soon as we leave school, because we don't have to any more -- no one will make us learn. We entrust our health to doctors we have vested with an almost god-like power and authority, and take whatever drugs and potions they say we need, and we are in worse shape than ever. Too many people are walking around with tunnel vision. Science is the study of what is. Every one of us starts out as a scientist. The scientific method can be employed by anyone. The fruits of science belong to everyone. Anyone can learn about quantum physics if they want to, and converse about it as intelligently as they are able with the level of knowledge they possess. Those who decry laymen discussing science need to stop trying to hoard knowledge to maintain some kind of elite power-dynamic the ""scientists"" can wield over the rest of us ignorant plebes (take a lesson from what happened to the Roman Catholic Church when the masses finally got to read the Bible in their own tongue).There is so much more to this world than we know, and there always will be, b/c of our limited perspective. It seems to me that if we ever came to the end of our scientific investigation of what is, we would probably die out due to the frustration of our innate curiousity.Watch the movie, don't expect greatness, but do open your mind a little.

This movie enthralled me from start to finish. And I'll admit, I had a problem with JZ Knight's inclusion in the panel of experts being interviewed...when she first became what you'd call a public figure back in the late 70's, I saw a film clip of her ""channeling"" Ramtha. Regardless of whether you interpret Ramtha's words as timeless wisdom or cosmic hooey, JZ's ""performance"" of being under Ramtha's spell was, at the very least, questionable. I am open to the spiritual possibility of channeling, even though I have yet to experience it myself...but if someone like JZ or the one who calls himself ""Lazarus"" is going to present it as a viable concept, it should at least give the appearance of being believable, and not something that looks as if it could have come out of a tent at a carnival.There are 618 reviews ahead of me and I'm astounded at the depth of hatred being generated over a movie that, for all intents and purposes, exists for the sole intention of bringing us into a greater awareness of what we perceive to be reality and spirituality. As some have noted, when certain types have their deep-seeded thinking challenged--when the walls of their belief systems appear to be about to cave in on them--the first reaction is somewhere between hostility and ""kill it!"" You know, kind of like the yokels in old science fiction movies who see a UFO or an alien, and immediately go for their guns. How sad is that? And amusingly enough, have you noticed that most of the 1-star diatribes include grade school level misspellings and sub-par grammar? This leads me to believe that these reviewers aren't paying enough attention to the detail of what they're saying...or, more to the point, they just don't PAY ATTENTION. To do that requires effort. Thinking, and maintaining an open mind, requires effort. The path of least resistance is always the more frequently traveled one for the vast majority of the human race, which indicates to me why so many people gave this movie such vitriolic ""reviews.""For me, what I got most out of this movie was the uplifting message behind the talk of quantum physics and its multi-layered facets, especially when they delved into the spirituality questions facing us all as individuals and as a race of beings. Many reviewers here have recommended other books instead of or in addition to the material presented here; the one I would recommend would be Neale Donald Walsch's CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD trilogy. Those 3 books had an indelible life-changing effect on me (pointing out in unmistakable terms what God IS and ISN'T), as has this movie. If, after reading these reviews, you're convinced that it's a propaganda film for JZ Knight, that it's all ""New Age hogwash,"" that the interview segments were ""subversively edited to fit their purpose,"" then by all means, don't waste your precious time watching it. Stay safe and warm, right where you are. But if you want to remove the rose-colored glasses and get what I believe to be a pretty good glimpse at a clearer view of Life as we thought we knew it, then plug in that wonderful open mind of yours and be prepared for a new experience. Only a complete dunce could walk away from this movie unmoved, one way or another. And I am in complete agreement with those who've expressed excitement at all the DISCUSSION this movie has generated...seriously! Bring up topics like philosophy and spirituality, and then step back and watch the fireworks. :o) Kudos and heartfelt thanks to the family of truth-seekers who put this movie together and gave it to the world.2 final points: 1. I loved the soundtrack to this movie. In addition to incidental music being provided by grand Tangerine Dream alumnus Christoph Franke, they even included a snippet of ""Tingri Maiden"" by my electronic music idol, Jonn Serrie. Great music throughout the entire flick; I wish there were a soundtrack CD available. 2.

He said; ""All my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundation of physics to this new type of knowledge failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under me"". And; ""The quanta really are a hopeless mess"". Einstein was mightily humbled by the vast implications. The quanta are a hopeless mess from a classical Newtonian perspective because it appears random or limitless in expression, and the results of endless controlled experiments prove beyond any doubt that the thoughts and intentions of the observer profoundly effect the results. This film, in an imaginative way, explores the possible implications of the quantum field. I wish I could say that I really like this film, but I applaud the attempt, I think it's on the right track. There are many who see an exciting new Renaissance in physics on the horizon that will change everything. For example, do you know that subatomic particles have been consistently detected that appear and disappear, seemingly to bi-locate (you know, like Star Trek), and is not even subject to our concept of linear time (that part is really deep). And do you know that in the last decade+ within established circles it has become overwhelmingly accepted that all matter is energy, and is almost entirely empty space. And the sum total of all solid matter in the entire universe could be contained within a particle smaller than a quark, called a singularity or infinite density. This calculation, being so unimaginably close to zero solid matter should act as a big hint. It points to an illusion created by the quantum field, directed by consciousness(which does not imply only an individuals consciousness), for the purpose of providing an experience for the observer. Does that seem too far-out for you? Congratulations,.....you are in the majority. If it was an election you would be on the winning side........ A little clarification may be useful to some. The word illusion as it is used here isn't meant to imply that physical matter isn't real, only that it isn't what it appears to be. Also, the word observer merely denotes a unit of consciousness within the field, and not necessarily or exclusively any particular process that may be associated with the word. And most importantly, the term empty space is only meant to refer to the absence of separate and solid matter. There is actually no such thing as empty space, all is full and inseparable. The exchange of information through consciousness creates vortices, also called torsion fields, that produces the illusion of borders or a separation of matter. This intelligent self-organizing effect, called a fractal feedback dynamic, is all that exists ultimately, and there is not and can not be any separation between anything..... Bare in mind the words of a marvelous philosopher ""All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed, second it is violently opposed, and third, it is accepted as self-evident.""

She runs on the beach of the Caribbean seeing the ships of Columbus approach the shores of the new world for the first time with a native American who has never seen a ship; she plays basketball with a kid who ask ""how far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?"" in a vague reference to the superposition of several wave functions of an object (s) and conscious observer that crystallize physical reality (according to Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics). She stands in an airport taking pictures of air travelers; attends a wedding, the reception and finds that she hates weddings, she hates herself for trusting guys, being cheated upon, and lost love. She expresses rage at the sight of infidelity and her utter disappointment in married life. She lives with a room mate named Jennifer (Elaine Hendrix) who is friendly and loveable, but Amanda is unhappy in life, then what exactly is she looking for in life? She is searching for the soul, pure consciousness, and meaning of life (reality and existence.) She is not a physicist, and utters very few words in the movie which are not intelligible and her strange accent makes it difficult to understand her. Yet the scene is set for experts to give their opinion on quantum reality and consciousness in a PBS style documentary similar to NOVA. Experts in quantum physics include, Amit Goswami, Fred Alan Wolf, and few others; and neurobiologists include; Stuart Hameroff, Candace Pert, and few others.Amit Goswami dwells on wave - particle duality of quantum physics and reality in terms of possibilities (should have been probabilities). One commentator states that God is a superposition of realities (probably because he is the ultimate conscious observer, who happens to see everything in the universe,) but there is a little question that gets unanswered; what reality is the expert talking about? Quantum reality as explained by Copenhagen school of thought? Another commentator observes that we all are connected to the universe at the most fundamental level but doesn't elaborate.Cells are the smallest unit of consciousness, but the panel of experts doesn't say if consciousness exists in lower animals and plant kingdom. Roger Penrose elsewhere states that consciousness exists in lower animals but he doesn't know how far down the ladder it goes (1). Erwin Schrodinger in his book ""What's Life"" states that consciousness exists in all animal species (2). Some philosophers claim that plants also have consciousness because a living cell is the basic foundation for central nervous system and consciousness.The movie refers to the work of Masaru Emoto which purportedly show that good words, good music, and blessings on water results in good crystals upon cooling is really absurd (3). The animated neural cells during the dance at the wedding reception are perhaps boring and a love making scene is totally inappropriate when discussing serious physics.

The idea that our thoughts come from quantum fluctuations was covered in ""The Emperor's New Mind"" by Penrose.  The notion that quantum theory has deep philosophical roots was covered in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" by Zukin. And the idea that we create our own world through our thoughts was discussed deeply in ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill and ""The Power of Intention"" by Wayne Dyer.Given that I already believe the ideas behind ""WTBDWK"", I was looking forward to a documentary that approached these ideas in a new and interesting way.  I was sorely disappointed.The documentary completely failed to make its point.  It's anonymous interviews with spacey looking individuals did nothing to support its assertions (they are named after it is over.) Most of these people seem to have been chosen to match our stereotype of what a strange new-age scientist would look like.  Many of them have an annoying superior attitude.The documentary never makes a coherent argument.  It never explains itself in terms that a lay person could understand.  It never relates the concepts it espouses to the real world.  Apparently, it was attempting to do this through the Matlin drama -- a story about a jilted woman who is depressed. But one does not walk away with a firm grasp of anything.The documentary seemed to be designed to blow the mind of the naive.  Perhaps it succeeds at that level.

I think the reviews so vocally against it are the most telling: some people are easily freaked out by just asking questions. These are the same people who when confronted with unexplained phenomena jump to absurd ""closest cousin"" answers and refuse to talk about it ever again. We have to be willing to not preemptively dismiss possibilities, or worse, throw the covers over our head in the face of spooky new concepts. So for courage and dignity in exploring the potentialities of life, I give What The Bleep full credit.I also find it strange that people think there's some sort of cult involved with liking or the making of this film.

I already know a great deal of what their talking about. Enough, at least, to know that this movie has done a horrible job of delivering its message.From a production stand-point, this movie is unforgiveabley bad.  The graphics are greatly over done, as is the sound, making the movie almost incoherenet from an information delivery perspective.  In some scenes you can barely hear the speaker over the volume of the soundtrack.  In other words, the message almost gets totally lost in the bloody media!  The message is drowning in a sea of graphics and sound track!  I see more and more of this kind of mistake in this infantile age of hyper-media.  The whiz-bang drowns out the message, or the message takes a distant second to the hyped-up grahics and cool sound track.Further, there's so little information offered about each subject area covered, that those who aren't already knowledgeable about the subjects get no coherent message from the movie.  That's a horrible way to introduce the fine research done in these fields.  The rest of the movie is bloody eye-candy!As far as Ramtha goes, she has no bloody business being in this movie whatsoever.  Her presence has tainted the messages brought by those serious scientists that took the time to present their research. Ramtha, to me, is highly questionable.

192851,A1S8AJIUIO6M9K,1582704414,Robert David STEELE Vivas,"[8, 21]","EDIT of 20 Dec 07 to add links and one line at end.This DVD is truly extraordinary.  I have nine note cards on it.  Here is my very positive summary of key points in this very serious DVD that pulls together credible useful thoughts from some real professionals.  This movie held my counter-culture teen-agers attention for a full 45 minutes, which is quite extraordinary in and of itself.1)  Multiple realities exist side by side across time and space.2)  You can move outside ""your"" reality to see yourself from outside or from another reality.3)  Major problem in our culture today is that children are not learning to think or imagine broadly.4)  Much of what we are taught to think is not true.5)  Modern materialism and most religions have stripped individuals of their ability to see that they are both responsible, and capable, for affecting their environment.5)  Quantum physics opens new ways for individuals to grab responsibility and *live* life to its fullest.6)  New model says that internal reality is more important that external reality, and it does impact on the environment.7)  Brains do not know difference between what one sees and what one imagines.8)  Natives upon Columbus' arrival could not ""see"" the ships--one cannot see what one has not learned to imagine.9)  Sub-atomic world is beyond current physics--it is not about the matter, but rather about the empty space between the matter.  It is not matter that is a live but rather the empty space (as in a basketball) that is full of information.10)  Nothing material exists without interaction with a thinking being.  Material is NOT independent, on the contrary, it is totally dependent on perception.  Perception is about possibilities, not absolutes.11)  Consciousness drives material reality; perception activates signatures.12)  4000+ meditators dropped crime in Washington DC by 25%.  The Chief of Police was a skeptic, and then a believer.  People, and their thoughts, DO affect reality.13)  Water is responsive to thinking, more so than other materials.  Photographs of water crystallization after good thinking (e.g. thank you written on side of water bottle) are quite amazing.14)  If thoughts can crystallize water, imagine what the collective intelligence and good will of all mankind could do?15)  There are different levels of truth but the deepest level of truth is that we are all one.  We are at one with the larger whole that is God (community) and with one another, but religions have become corrupt and prescriptive rather than enlightened and inclusive.  Control of God's image is the height of arrogance.16)  Emotion is a memory enhanced by chemical addition (internal).  Problem for most is that they are operating as if today were yesterday, applying old mindsets, rather than working as a part of a larger integrated whole.17)  Mind DOES influence the body.  Emotional toxins and habits are as powerful as heroin.18)  We must learn to dream better, and to dream bigger dreams.19)  Definitions of beauty and valor (like definitions of crime and insanity) are illusory, false, and have no authority.  There is more to life than the definitions, you simply need to seek it and see it.20)  Change your choices, change your life.  Be ready for a chemical withdrawal as you abandon bad old habits.21)  It's not about good or evil, black or white.  Life is nuances, to be *experienced*.  You are you own pilot, you are your own priest.22)  You co-create your future by your thinking, imagination, wanting, your choices.  PAY ATTENTION and you will get what you wish.23)  You can influence your body, others, the environment, and the future.24)  We are all one; we are not alone; we are connected; we are collective intelligence; we are, in the whole, both God and Heaven on Earth.I buy into this.  This is serious good stuff.I used  to turn off when people talked about the paranormal, even through CIA spent a lot of money on ""remote viewing"" and I have two books in line waiting to be read;

192852,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,1582704414,Roland E. Zwick,"[14, 20]","If you're looking to have your mind blown for an hour and 48 minutes, check out ""What the #$*! Do We Know?,"" a documentary about, of all things, Quantum Physics, the place where science and New Age mysticism meet and find common ground.  Quantum Physics, the study of what occurs at the level of sub-atomic particles, deals with such issues as what is reality, what is matter, what is time and space.  The film addresses these topics mainly through interviews with top scientists and thinkers, who manage to keep the discussion reasonably coherent for even scientifically illiterate persons like myself.  They discuss in lengthy detail the existence and nature of God, the structure of the universe, and the ways in which the elements that make up the human mind and body create the feelings and emotions we experience on a daily basis.  It's all very ""out there,"" but fun as a brain teaser, if you go in for that sort of thing.The film itself is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of its overall quality.  It is at its best when it focuses on the scientific and philosophical complexities and ambiguities of its subject matter, and at its worst in the scenes involving Marlee Matlin as a professional photographer looking for meaning and answers in the world around her.

My skeptical side, however, coupled with the negative reviews I read on this site, made me do my research.  I also did not really agree with everything in the movie.  What also made me skeptical was the whole Ramtha thing.  I didn't even know what it was until I saw this movie and then looked it up online.  What I learned is that this film was made by the Ramtha cult.  Do you know how scary that is?  I was almost sucked into this crap!!  I was born and raised in the Mormon church, saw the light and left when I was 18, and promised myself I would never get sucked into a cult again.  (I am now happily agnostic.)  It is scary that there are so many organizations out there that want to control your mind.  It is better to think for yourself and keep an open mind.  If you can separate the good things about the movie (promoting healthy self-esteem, treating others with kindness and respect, knowing that the mind is a very powerful thing) from the mumbo-jumbo (masking mysticism as quantum physics, the Japanese water crystal thing) then you can get something helpful out of it.

192859,AYIHIIOO7Z6P0,1582704414,Ruth Henriquez Lyon,"[10, 13]","""What the Bleep"" looks at quantum mechanics and how it might relate to the human mind.  It's interesting that, in each era we've passed through since Newton, theories of mind tend to mirror whatever happens to be the scientific theory of the day.  Thus in the age of the steam engine we had Freud's theory of repressed unconscious energy building up pressure and being released through dreams and slips of the tongue.  In the cyber age we've used computers as metaphors for how the mind works.In the same vein, we are now beginning to look at the mind in terms of quantum physics.  This does not negate the previous metaphors, but rather builds on them.  According to the scientists on ""What the Bleep,"" the quantum world is not determined, but rather potential.  That is, nothing is really set in stone until an observer observes it.  Thus we, as observers, have a huge effect on the reality around us via our attitudes and thoughts.  Rather than being helpless victims being acted on by an insensate world, we live in an interconnected, conscious universe in which thoughts, emotions, and information send out ripples which affect the universe.The film contains short bits of discourse from various scientists and thinkers interspersed with a story of sorts that is put in there, I suppose, to illustrate the points made by the experts.  I found many of the scientific explanations for laymen to be clear and very interesting, but the film also had some problems.The story centers around a deaf woman who seems to be an extremely self-absorbed ""H.S.P.,"" that is, a ""Highly Sensitive Person.""  Everything she bumps up against seems to affect her in the way that salt affects a slug.  I found this distracting and rather overdone.  Also, the uneven sound quality makes it so you have to crank up the volume for the discourse and turn it down for the music.In addition, the speakers are not credited until the end.  I was at times unable to figure out whether a speaker was a scientist or someone in the spirituality field with an interest in science.  A lot of time was given to the ideas of  JZ Knight, who, it seemed to me, had a lot of opinions based on, well, her opinions.  If she had data or experience to back them up we did not hear about that.But the main question I have after viewing ""What the Bleep"" has to do with whether or not the quantum level of physics can practically interact with the Newtonian level of physics, which is the level we live at every day.  According to quantum physics, most of everything is empty space.  I accept that.  But I still cannot walk through a wall, because I inhabit a Newtonian world--albeit one which emerges out of a quantum foundation.Now if, indeed, there is research showing that all the mystical, magical aspects of the quantum level can indeed reach up through the Newtonian level and render reality more fluid than we generally regard it to be, that's great.  I want to see it, and I wish the film would have presented it.  But until I do see it, I wonder if trying to merge quantum and Newtonian modes of experience isn't sort of like mixing metaphors.",4,Thought provoking and slightly annoying.,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,3110,"['What', 'Bleep', 'quantum', 'mechanics', 'how', 'might', 'relate', 'human', 'mind', 'interesting', 'era', ""'ve"", 'passed', 'Newton', 'theories', 'mind', 'tend', 'mirror', 'happens', 'be', 'scientific', 'theory', 'day', 'Thus', 'age', 'steam', 'engine', 'had', 'Freud', 'theory', 'repressed', 'unconscious', 'energy', 'building', 'up', 'pressure', 'being', 'released', 'dreams', 'slips', 'tongue', 'cyber', 'age', ""'ve"", 'used', 'computers', 'metaphors', 'how', 'mind', 'works.In', 'same', 'vein', 'are', 'now', 'beginning', 'look', 'mind', 'terms', 'quantum', 'physics', 'not', 'negate', 'previous', 'metaphors', 'rather', 'builds', 'According', 'scientists', 'What', 'Bleep', 'quantum', 'world', 'not', 'determined', 'rather', 'potential', 'nothing', 'really', 'set', 'stone', 'observer', 'Thus', 'observers', 'have', 'huge', 'effect', 'reality', 'attitudes', 'thoughts', 'Rather', 'being', 'helpless', 'victims', 'being', 'acted', 'insensate', 'world', 'live', 'interconnected', 'conscious', 'universe', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'information', 'send', 'out', 'ripples', 'affect', 'universe.The', 'film', 'contains', 'short', 'bits', 'discourse', 'various', 'scientists', 'thinkers', 'interspersed', 'story', 'sorts', 'put', 'there', 'suppose', 'illustrate', 'points', 'made', 'experts', 'found', 'many', 'scientific', 'explanations', 'laymen', 'be', 'clear', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'problems.The', 'story', 'centers', 'deaf', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'extremely', 'self-absorbed', 'H.S.P.', 'Highly', 'Sensitive', 'Person', 'Everything', 'bumps', 'up', 'affect', 'way', 'salt', 'slug', 'found', 'distracting', 'rather', 'overdone', 'Also', 'uneven', 'sound', 'quality', 'have', 'crank', 'up', 'volume', 'discourse', 'turn', 'down', 'music.In', 'addition', 'speakers', 'are', 'not', 'credited', 'end', 'was', 'times', 'unable', 'figure', 'out', 'speaker', 'was', 'scientist', 'someone', 'spirituality', 'field', 'interest', 'science', 'lot', 'time', 'was', 'given', 'ideas', 'JZ', 'Knight', 'who', 'seemed', 'had', 'lot', 'opinions', 'based', 'well', 'opinions', 'had', 'data', 'experience', 'back', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'hear', 'main', 'question', 'have', 'viewing', 'What', 'Bleep', 'do', 'not', 'quantum', 'level', 'physics', 'can', 'practically', 'interact', 'Newtonian', 'level', 'physics', 'level', 'live', 'day', 'According', 'quantum', 'physics', 'most', 'everything', 'empty', 'space', 'accept', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'walk', 'wall', 'inhabit', 'Newtonian', 'world', 'one', 'quantum', 'foundation.Now', 'indeed', 'research', 'showing', 'mystical', 'magical', 'aspects', 'quantum', 'level', 'can', 'indeed', 'reach', 'up', 'Newtonian', 'level', 'render', 'reality', 'more', 'fluid', 'generally', 'regard', 'be', 'great', 'want', 'see', 'wish', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'presented', 'do', 'see', 'wonder', 'trying', 'merge', 'quantum', 'Newtonian', 'modes', 'experience', ""n't"", 'sort', 'mixing', 'metaphors']",N/A

Slick and modern-looking, the film's stylish trappings are completely undone by its meandering theme, that both science and religion seek to provide an answer to the meaning-of-life question. That their central hypothesis is true doesn't stand in the way of the directors (plural, always a bad sign) and their guests who, in that confident, wide-eyed new-agey way, do everything they can to obfuscate the message along the way.And what guests. No namecards nor job titles are provided until the end, and you're left to wonder ""oh, this guy's a Quantum Physicist. Oh wait, no, he's an endocrinologist. Wait, no he's a relationship therapist."" Sooner or later this becomes ""aaahh bogus, he's a LIFE COACH???"" Actually the whole film works this way - it's promoed a bit like the Quantum Physicist's rebuff to Nova's excellent ""The Elegant Universe"", professor Brian Green's intro to String Theory which has its own tendency for flash and tongue-in-cheek. But before long you realize that ""What The Bleep"" has a LOT more fish to fry. Poorly.Not that everything it does is done poorly. The first third in particular has some highly impactful moments, like the story of the Indians who couldn't see ships approaching their New World, because such a sight was beyond comprehension. The film makes good points about the relative emptyness of the universe, and about the tendency in Quantum Mechanics for particles to appear and disappear (Steven Hawking's ""annihilating particles""). Without even naming it, nor adequately explaining it, the film does manage to gloss over Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the basis of much of the film's suppositions.So what the bleep is this movie, anyway? A science movie, a dramady? A self-help guide? A new-age manifesto? Really hard to tell. It's not a complete waste of time but can't really be taken seriously on its face. ""The Elegant Universe"" is a much better choice if you want an introduction on how Strings and Quantum Mechanics affect the chaotic subatomic world. Steven Hawking frequently makes the argument that science and religion seek to explain the same fundamental mysteries in ""A Brief History Of Time"". And there's real science in there too.

The video goes into what we as a community of thinkers and scientists are learning about the human mind and reality. As a psychology teacher the information on ""plasticity"" (changing your mental structure for better or worse) is very accurate and has been shown to be what happens in the brains of addicts AND in the brains of those who meditate. So, in this way this movie shows that much of your reality is constructed by you, which is why a die hard optimist and a die hard pessimist will probably never convince the other they are wrong, it's a mental outlook, that can change with time and effort.So, finally this video is simply excellent.

This movie has nothing to do with real physics, except where they use quantum theory to prove their ideology.3.  This is mainly about cognitive pseudoscience.

I know this review reads as if I'm close-minded and find offense in a movie about alternative views of consciousness.  This isn't the case.

192872,A9LSD2OG27I8B,1582704414,"Stephen B. Cobb ""Shameless Reductionist""","[64, 82]","I was sad to see Marlee Matlin in this, as she was brilliant in Children of a Lesser God.Let's be fair: this movie has its proper audience.  There is a good part of the population wandering about in a spiritual and scientific Valley of the Blind, and they need something to grab onto.  They have little knowledge of human psychology or quantum physics, and they seek not truth but security.  ""Perceived control"" is a great pacifier, and this movie spoons it out.If you do not fall into the above category, do not see this movie unless you are taking an unsophisticated date that you want to bedazzle.  If you actually know something about psychology and quantum physics, and want to learn something more, then avoid this movie at all costs, or you will spend a painful 90 minutes in a New Age distortion of 20-year-old science.  The only exception is if you are a psychologist or anthropologist studying human religious beliefs, in which case you could deduce something about the unsatiable human needs that drive us to come up with this stuff.Message to New Agers: the universe wasn't created to satisfy your needs, nor were you created to fit happily into the universe.  Deal with it.  As the Buddhists say, the source of suffering is desire.

I thought I was buying something that had new and awesome facts about the physical universe, presented in a new and awsome way.  Well, I  was wrong.  This is propaganda.  Although none of the talking heads (""I'm not really a physicist, but I play one on TV"") admit it, they aren't really as interested in saying anything interesting about quantum physics as they are shilling for the ""Ramtha"" cult. AS it turns out, the latter is the sole reason for this movie's existence.One of those talking heads is a bottle blond with the fake vaguely European/red-state accent and REALLY heavy makeup (a la Tammy Baker).  The end-credits identify her as ""Ramtha.""  Her real name is J.Z. Knight and she has claimed for a number of years to be channeling a 35,000 year old sage named ""Ramtha"" and asks her followers to pay for it.  (It's a testimony to the desert of American spirituality that so many morons actually do pay her.)  The movie makers hide this, which is telling.And what is the lesson quantum physics has allegedly taught us?  Everybody creates his/her own reality.  Since most people know that this is nonsense, the filmakers tart the movie up with ""experts"" to deceive you into thinking this is a scientific proposition.  I guess this is so people won't walk out or throw the DVD into the garbage with a glad cry.OKAY HEAR THIS: Individuals do not create reality; they conform to it whether they like it or not.  The whole BASIS of the scientific method depends on the first principle that reality is objective, so if I get the premise wrong the result will be wrong. In other words, if I'm doing science instead of just pretending like the ""experts"" in this movie, what I'm doing is systematically looking for an objective account of what seems to be, everywhere and always, the case.Oh, and Marlee Matlin is absolutely exruciating to watch.

Any book/film that approaches anything resembling religious philosophy will trigger people, as the varying reviews have indicated. Unlike the Harry Potter phenomenon, we haven't seen Right Wing Christians burning copies of What The Bleep yet, but it still managed to get people fired up.Ironically, the film's biggest weakness is that it focuses far too much on the physical, with 'experts' repeatedly babbling about receptors and peptides. That's all fine and dandy, but you can't possibly hope to understand anything about the nature of the human experience without at least brushing on Bell's Theorem/Non-Locality as it relates to Eastern mysticism, The Baghavad Gita etc. The chaff factor among the various speakers is such that even though the concept of Oneness is fleetingly mentioned, it never takes center stage in the form of an open recognition of Collective Consciousness.I'm giving it 5 stars because it's a good introduction to Quantum Theory, even though it doesn't really touch on the literally dozens of Quantum Reality Theories of how and why we perceive reality, and what it even means - such as Observer Created Reality (only dealt with tangentially), whereby things theoretically only exist in the presence of Consciousness, and Bentov's theory that there is only Consciousness in the Universe.'Experts' babble about 'creating reality' but none of the speakers get down to the nitty gritty and expand on their fleeting insights enough to give the new viewer a solid foundation.Yet this is a highly entertaining film, with John Ross Bowie just about stealing the show as Elliott, during the Polish Wedding scenes. To my surprise, this film manages to be funny and sexy while also being informative, albeit at a very superficial level. The young guys scoping the females at the dance were very entertaining. The First Person Luster camera work, whereby the guys were evaluating the females on a Terminator-style visual overlay, was surprisingly un-PC - especially contrasting the 'FOX' evaluation for an attractive woman with the SYSTEM CRASH response to viewing an older, obese female.At the other end of the PC spectrum, you have the Wise Male Black Kid with, guess what?

Despite the *relative* popularity (note the emphasis on ""relative"") of such books, the average person in the street has never read a science book that wasn't assigned to them in high school or college. And those books certainly weren't speculating on the nature of Life, the Universe and Everything based on the implications of quantum physics!In my own life, awareness of the intersection of science of spirituality has given me a smidgen of additional fuel in my life of studying Christian and Eastern mysticism. So imagine my delight when I learned ""What the Bleep"" promised an exciting investigation into the cutting edge of science and spirituality. Surely there would interviews with people like Rupert Sheldrake, Freeman Dyson, and Larry Dossey!Well, no, although most of the scientists were well-qualified to speak on the quantum concepts addressed. Strangely, the film undercut itself intellectually by not giving the names and qualifications of the speakers underneath their ""talking heads"" but only at the end. Regarding spiritual speculations, I find Capra, Sheldrake, and Dossey have more depth when it comes to this sort of thought, but the opinions shared may be eye-opening for many viewers who have never considered the inter-connectedness of mind, the universe, and God.""What the bleep"" has a beautiful visual style, exciting graphic effects, and also gets out of typical documentary mode by creating a small story of a deaf woman photographer's frustrations with life. The ""Polish Wedding"" sequence is hilarious, and might actually have you rolling in the aisles, as it did me!The disappointment comes, oddly enough from the ""Spiritual Teachers, Mystics, and Scholars"" used. Sounds impressive right? There were only two. One was ""Miceal"" Ledwith, (elsewhere spelled Micheal), former member of the Catholic International Theological Commission, (who retired from Maynooth College in Ireland about the same time he made a private settlement regarding sexual abuse of a minor--see the Irish Times article of June 1 2002). The other was--get ready--RAMTHA! Yes, Ramtha, the absurd ""Neolithic entity"" supposedly channeled by JZ Knight.Both Ledwith and Ramtha seemed to only be used to bash conventional religion with ""the shackles of restrictive doctrine,"" and in Ramtha's case, assure us all that we are God. Yippee! No need to worry about meditation, service, or denying the ego. Why, I wondered, would someone go to the trouble of sharing the scientific plausibility of mysticism only to undercut it with the bitter statements of a former Catholic priest and the laughingstock of New-Age kookiness?Perhaps it's because, according to Wikipedia.org, all three filmmakers are students of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment.

All three directors follow this woman JZ Knight. These are the philosophies of the film.* The Statement, ""You are God""* The mandate to Make Known the Unknown* The concept that Consciousness and Energy Creates the nature ofReality.* The challenge to Conquer YourselfThese are also the teachings of Ramtha.

And all oral records of the Native American tribe the Awarks were lost in over a 100 years of spanish rule.Humans aren't 90% water as this film wrongly states.

Perhaps there is a coherent and entertaining film buried in there somewhere, but as it stands now, what we have is two hours of incoherence.  The switching between talking heads and a dramatic story featuring Marlee Matlin does not work.  Rather than complement one another, the film's two ""halves"" serve only to confuse and muddle the proceedings.  I found the Marlee Matlin scenes totally unnecessary - they neither enhanced the talking points nor were particularly entertaining.  The interviews were the most interesting aspect of the film, but the clips are too brief to be of much use.  Quantum physics is not something you can describe adequately in a one-minute sound bite.A better approach would have been to keep the special effects (not bad) and include longer interview segments with the so-called experts (minus the Ramtha lady, whose presence delegitimizes the entire film).

The transition is subtle; it is not until the end of the movie that you learn one of the speakers is not a speaker at all, but the spirit of some dead dude(!) being channeled through that speaker.The film does, however, demonstrate that there are scientists out there that retain their religeous beliefs despite being a scientist, I suppose that could be good for some viewers (but not this atheist!).So- if you have a surplus of quartz crystals around the house, this movie is for you.

It provides an explanation of quantum physics that's creative and accessible to the non-scientific public (of which I'm a part).  The film is challenging in the way it explains the nature of reality in general and human emotions and behaviors in specific.Where this movie takes a great ""leep"" for me is when they try to connect quantum theory with religion.  The film sets up a straw man of religion as simply an authoritarian system of rules and then uses quantum mechanics to knock it down.  It's rather easy for them to do, but only because their view of the nature of a kind of traditional God is simplistic.  In questioning the nature of reality they throw out the reality of a God external to the creation.  This is a leap requiring as much or more faith than an orthodox theist.It's entirely possible within a theistic worldview that God is, to use the language of the film, ""the ultimate observer.""  God could use quantum mechanics in the universe without dismantling every aspect of revealed religion.  In fact, in one of the lecturers discussion of addiction, it would be as easy for him to argue for an authoritarian ""religion of quantum physics"" to help people control addiction.The final ""leep"" of the film is in the area of ethics.  Since they seek to dispel any notion at all of an external observer with any moral authority, the film presents nothing to show that good is preferable to evil, no matter how you define either term.  Using thought experiments on water crystals, the film shows how much more orderly and beautiful ice crystals are when influenced by loving thoughts, and how the reverse is also true, but cannot really convince why beautiful and orderly is really preferable in a universal sense.  In other words, if my quantum-induced addiction makes me want to torture and kill, why fight it?

With the assistance of fellow Monks, he assumed full lotus, while gasoline was poured over him and he was then set afire.He moved not a muscle. He sat and he burned for a number of minutes and still never moved a muscle. Finally his charred body fell backwards on the street. Onlookers, passersby with camera's snapped pictures and someone even captured it on film. Which is available to view today on You Tube.Mr. Duuk sacrificed himself to protest the then south Vietnamese government and it's abuse and oppression of the Buddhist people of Vietnam.Mr.Duuk's sacrifice became one in a long list of world famous photos.The reason I mention this is not only out of great respect for Mr.Duuk, but to also bring it into alignment with the proposal of this movie in how the power of the mind can control and be responsible for the individual's perception and experience of their unique reality.If the material world is not affected by our thoughts, and we can not affect our life by changing our mind in any way, how then does a Mahayana Buddhist monk voluntarily assume the Lotus position on a busy street, allow gasoline to be poured over him and then be set afire, and he doesn't move a muscle the whole time his body is burning to char?This WTBDWK DVD is worth every penny.

Those same who deny anything that cannot be objectively verified and measured, are said by Newton and Plato to: ""acknowledge what is merely far less than half of the cosmos to be known and understood"".It is the modern  cult of materialism/nihilism that posits that science and philosophy/metaphysics are ""oil and water"" antinomies.

192901,A1AST6JNBJ95VC,1582704414,Victory,"[40, 54]","I just finished watching ""What the Bleep do we Know?"" and feel compelled to write this review.  You should watch this movie not because it will enlighten you and make you see your world in a different way but because it is in a sense ""educational.""  It educates the viewer on what bad science is.I have two main problems with this movie:  one is based on science, the other is based on religion.Since the time of Copernicus and Galileo science and religion have been at loggerheads.  Scientific atheists have overstepped their bounds and claimed there is no God since he can not be proved.  Meanwhile, religious lay and clergy have reacted with fundamentalism and overstepped their bounds by claiming science is faulty and so they come up with their own ""science"" (Intelligent Design and Creationism among others).  The movie is about scientists overstepping their bounds and becoming theologians.  Buy it because it shows you what NOT to beleive about science and religion.I am a scientist (Physics) and an engineer (Electrical) and keep abreast of the latest scientific developments and I can tell you this movie is a lot of bad science.  But don't take my word for it.  Ask yourself ""Where are the heavy hitters in this movie?  Why don't I see Steven Weinberg, Murray Gell-Man, or Stephen Hawking in this movie backing up these theories?""  The ""scientists"" interviewed are merely science writers with a lot of New Age philosophy at their core.  I'm sure some of them are scientists but after viewing the extra material on the DVD where the directors talked about interviewing them I think any REAL scientist involved with this project was caught up in the Hollywood glamour and agreed to make the movie against his or her better judgment.The biggest problem I have with the science in this movie is its depiction of Quantum Mechanics.  It is the science of ""infinite possibilities"" according to the movie.  True.  Probability plays a key role in Quantum Mechanics (on a tangent. . .Douglas Adams has a lot of fun with QM with his ""improbability drive"" in ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.""  His improbability drive has as much probability of instantly sending someone across the galaxy in tact as some of the possibilities expressed in ""Bleep.""  Adams was joking around but Chasse is serious.)  No narrator, however, gets into the details of what is meant by ""infinite possibilities,"" so I will.There is a non-zero probability that when I run towards a brick wall I will pop out on the other side with no damage to myself or the wall.  That is a quantum mechanical probability.  The probability that that will happen is somewhere around one in ten to the 54th power.  It's a non-zero probability but very nearly zero.  The movie doesn't get into the ""improbability"" of the experiment.So what?  It's possible, right?  Yes.  But I have better things to do with my time than bang my head against the wall ten to the 54 times in hopes that just once I'll pop through.This quantum probability (quantum tunneling) has its place in the universe.  It is the reason why the sun burns as brightly as it does for such a long period of time at a temperature much LOWER than expected.  QM paved the way for the laser, transistor, nuclear power, and the electron microscope among other inventions.  Quantum Mechanics is truly a fascinating adventure but the movie never really delves into the real heart of the field or how it can legitimately affect the way we look at the universe.  A simple quantum dual slit diffraction experiment could illustrate the truly incredible ""quantum connection"" that exists between every particle in the universe and therefore between every person including you and me.  No real time is given to matters such as Quantum Teleportation, Quantum Encryption, or Quantum Computing.  No detail is presented in HOW we humans are all connected.  Instead, we are invited to imagine an existence where we rely on this idea of ""infinite possibilities"" to create our own reality which should include becoming our own gods.  It's very (yawn) empowering.The movie uses the ""infinite possibilities"" angle as a tool in which we can somehow guide our thoughts to create our own reality.  Could my thoughts transform and improve the probability of passing through a brick wall unscathed to, say, one in three or better?  The narrator seems to think that this can be accomplished by thought alone.  The point is that we, the observers, can not observe without changing that which is observed.  There is no ""out there"" that exists independant of our observations.  Physical phenomena are OBSERVED through our senses and our senses are a sophisticated collection of neural transmitters and pre-programmed patterns existing in the neural network of our brains.  Even matter itself can not escape existence through our observations.  Historically, the concept of matter has gone through change after change until we realize today that sub-atomic particles and atoms are very little more than just empty space.  Since matter doesn't exist without our thoughts and perceptions, our perceptions MAKE the world we live in.And that is where the problem is.  Saying ""matter is a thought"" is a non-sequitur.  Matter will exist and will be ""observed"" (through normal chemical and nuclear reactions such as solar fusion mentioned above) regardless of whether or not humans are around.  Matter is not a thought.  Matter makes up the universe.  We study matter.  We think about it.  We theorize on it.  But drawing the line between thought as CAUSE and tiny day to day improvements that would otherwise be thought of as disconnected as a macroscopic EFFECT in the ""plan your day"" model is not a product of science.  It is a product of wishful thinking, ad hoc reasoning, and debunked telekinesis.Notable quotables:""You really can walk on water if you completely believe it.""The idea is that even if we totally believe we can walk on water we still sink because our ""total belief"" is only a skin of belief enveloping a world of disbelief.  Thought affects matter as shown in the differing caracteristics of bottles of water frozen with emotional words pasted on the bottles for observers to view and think about (a grand example of bad science).  This experiment is used to show how thought can be used to manipulate matter--kind of like the bending spoons flop of an experiment on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.  We have been ""brainwashed,"" so says the narrator, through the media, religion, experience and socialization to believe we can't walk on water, therefore, we sink.  My belief is that if someone were to try to walk on water, PERHAPS after trying maybe ten to the 75 times it will work once.  The movie never goes into the numbers behind the ""infinite possibilities"" in Quantum Mechanics.""We are all on our way to becoming gods.""By the time a narrator mentions this line, the movie has gone way beyond science and is deep into religion.  The movie asserts:  The universe is big.  We are tiny.  Whatever we do could not possibly offend God the Creator of the Universe.  We are too insignificant.  As a scientist I have to challenge, ""Since we are so connected to each other and the universe show me the proof that we are so tiny and inoffensive.  Show me the proof that God doesn't concern himself with our issues even though I agree we may be insignificant in some respects.  In fact, show me the proof or at least the evidence that God is what the movie says he is.""According to a narrator, God is the superposition of everything we consider spiritual.  God is this ""concept.""  Furthermore, God is neither Old Testament nor New Testament.  God is a concept far more fluid and flexible than these antiquated versions.  We are spiritual.  We can touch the divine.  Remember, we are gods in the making.This is not a proof of God but an axiom--one that the viewer does not have to accept.  This is where the scientists overstep their bounds by becoming theologians and it is why you should buy this movie.  The movie can be thought of as ""Exhibit A"" in the heated struggle between science and religion.  It is bad science dressed up and worshipped as religion by New Age ""scientists.""Buy this DVD to get a great understanding of how bad science generates bad religion.  It is filled with scientists that neglect the math of probablility and therefore present a concept that sounds closer to magic or religion than it is to science.There are those that would say as a rebuttal, ""Any sufficiently advanced society will posess technology that to the same society two centuries earlier would look like magic.""True.  But any science--past, present, or future--functions on logic and reasoning.  Hiding the logic then drawing conclusions that advance telekinesis as this movie has done, disqualifies its ""scientific"" premise.Get it.  Watch it.  And when that twinge of disbelief hits you in the back of your brain pay attention to it.  And with an open mind explore your disbelief a little more.",5,A GREAT movie for all the wrong reasons,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,8989,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'What', 'Bleep', 'do',

This movie is full of amazing information that is uplifting, and empowering to the human mind and spirit. I found it to be somewhat complicted and confusing with the main theme(quantum physics), maybe that's why this is the kind of film that needs to be seen more than once to be fully  educated by it. This movie covers a wide range of studies including science, the mind, human behaviors, God and religions,and spirituality.In this documentary style film, Marlee Matlin plays a photographer dealing with frustration and self-loathing, because her past is still making her depressed most of her waking moments. She encounters people that triggers her emotions and how she learn to become a better observer rather than to judge a situation directly. Throughout this film, various professionals were interviewed on science, quantum physics, and philosophy. I particularly can relate to the causes of depression, emotional malfunction which causes a person to be self-destructive. It's really true that how we think inside can change how we look on the outside. It will definitely be helpful to anyone who had lost a grip of their true selves and regain the best of their body, mind, and spirit.Marlee Matlin is very impressive and mesmerizing at times.

That in turn changes the body, the physical substance of the mind, to reinforce those feelings. It's a positive and empowering message.The problem is, they distort or simply invent the science to support their message. Yes, in a common interpretation, the quantum wave function collapses when the observer measures the phenomenon (creating profound philosophical quandaries).

There is no mention or advertisement of Ramtha anywhere in the film, other than the end credits. If the message presented happens to coincide with that group (I have no idea if it does) it is certainly a universal message of hope and empowerment. The one thing that all the speakers have in common is a willingness to entertain and encourage thought beyond the mainstream, which is, of course where all truly creative ideas originate. This appears to frighten some people, who wish only safe middle-of-the-road concepts to be aired. For the person who doesn't know what ""Noetic Sciences"" are, that is an organization of scientists willing look beyond current paradigms, it was founded by astronaut Edgar Mitchell. This isn't a course in quantum physics, but it draws upon new ideas in physics to make its point.The film does have some weaknesses in in some of its special effects and it does tend to drone on too much about some points. Does it infer too much from the science of quantum physics, stretching the science to fit its viewpoint? Possibly.  Did it change my life? No, but it did make me think and will likely change my thinking in the future. FYI, I am a microbiologist and not some space cadet.
