827416,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000291Q52,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[8, 11]","This movie, `The Reckoning' which answers the question of what kind of plot can you construct in a Norman ruled Saxon village in the time of the plague in 11th century England of Richard the Lion-Hearted with a traveling troupe of actors who just lost their leader and is joined by a priest running from an adultery / murder he committed in a neighboring village. And, what can you do which will not even raise the slightest hint of contemporary heroes `Robin Hood' or Ivanhoe'.The first thing which impresses me about the movie is the contrast between the dullness of the clothes, faces, colors, and buildings in this movie compared to the similar foothills town of Edoras in `Lord of the Rings' which seems to shimmer with life, fresh air, magic, and portent. Somehow, it works, but it is almost a clich&eacute; in moviemaking to make the faces of medieval peasant folk be streaked with dirt, as if they never thought of doing anything with water aside from drinking it. These are observations and not criticisms. The set decorators, costumers, and makeup artists have all contrived to make the scenes and cast in this movie seems to have just stepped out of a Vermeer painting. Paul Bettany's facial structure and pallor of skin look especially medieval. The same can be said of most of the rest of the cast, except for Willem Dafoe, who looks inextricably 20th century, based on his well-known appearance in many well-known movies, not the least of which was `Platoon'.As the movie is a mystery, I have to be careful not to give too much away, as I am certainly recommending that you buy and see this movie if you have any taste at all for very intelligent thrillers, especially one with none of the 21st century mechanical violence involving cars, trains, trucks, motorcycles, and high powered firearms. This is pure drama, without even the kind of gimmicks used in the Sean Connery medieval mystery, `The Color of the Rose'. On the other hand, it is far more intense with very serious emotional involvement of the principles with the story than you will see in the very tame `Brother Cadfael' mysteries set in approximately the same time and location.As I suggest in the title, this story is very much based on how things would be seen by the traveling dramatic troupe appearing in `Hamlet'. The biggest difference between the troupe and the play in `Hamlet' and in `The Reckoning' is that in the latter, the recreation of the crime is the idea of the players, not the prince or other contractee. The idea arises innocently enough when the troupe's conventional morality play performances bring in a very meager audience, barely enough for the actors to pay for the burial of their dead. So, the leader of the troupe (Dafoe) suggests recreating the story of the woman condemned to execution for stealing from and killing a teenager on the evidence of a young monk. Based on very crude observations about the corpse and demurs from the audience, the suspicion arises that the deaf and dumb woman was not the perp. As the play arouses unrest among the peasants, the baron's men quickly direct the troupe out of town at sunup. The suspicions aroused by the play lead to the death, possibly from suicide, of the primary suspect in the affair, the young monk.The 110 minutes of dialogue on the screen  does not have the time to explore Norman English politics, so the relation between the officials carrying out the hanging, the baron, and the local magistrate who is oddly sympathetic to the actors' story, are not fully explained. Relations between the various actors create situations that are also not fully explained. The medieval tradition of men playing all womens' roles is also assumed, even though it may be mysterious that the troupe includes a woman whose place is confined to costuming and collecting admissions. She does not even have a vote in decisions of the troupe, even though she is the daughter of the recently dead leader and brother to the new leader. Her only perk seems to be that she gets to ride in the wagon while all the men walk.The script is based on a novel entitled `Morality Play', and I really wish they had retained this title, as it does a much better job of getting you into the sense of the story. There is also much too little made of the Bettany character's history aside from some vague, brief flashbacks whose sole purpose seems to be to explain what drives the character to pursuing the truth behind the murder which is a the heart of this story.The characters are all believable, the story is true to the facts and logic of life in Medieval Norman England, and the thread which takes the principles to the climax is interesting and believable, in spite of just a bit of skimping on background. It is immensely satisfying to find a story where the motive of the ultimate perp is simply because he wanted to, and he could.This movie may never ascend to status of cult classic, but it is truly a little gem of acting, directing, and setting into time and place.

Shakespearean in quality, and beautifully filmed in Andalucia, Spain and at Hedingham Castle near Essex, England, the 14th century period piece is given over to some excellent shots of the landscape as well as some impressive acting.Paul Bettany (THE DA VINCI CODE) stars as Nicholas, a priest on the lam after fornicating with a married woman and then accidentally killing her husband in self-defense. Hiding out in the forest, Nicholas encounters a troupe of hard-worn actors traveling between towns. Amongst them is their new leader Martin (Willem Dafoe, THE BOONDOCK SAINTS), Tobias (Brian Cox, RUNNING WITH SCISSORS), Sarah (Gina McKee, MIRRORMASK), and Stephen (Simon McBurney, THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND). Initially unwilling to take on a new person, the company neglects Nicholas' advances to join up with them. But through persistence, they eventually take him into their confidence.Nicholas moves farther and farther away from his old township but closer and closer to danger as his morality catches up with him via a deaf, healer wrongfully accused of killing a young boy. Martin (Dafoe), tired of doing the same old religious plays, decides to visit the condemned woman to find out whey she did it and to see if they can make a new stage show out of it. Nicholas accompanies him and what they discover is chilling. They both know she couldn't have done it via time-frames and her location at the time of the murder. But they can't go against the leader of the town, Lord De Guise (Vincent Cassel, OCEAN'S TWELVE), who's legal council has already convicted her.When the new play runs for the first time, the townspeople shout it down, telling the players that the boy couldn't have died at the hands of the healing, deaf woman. Faced with revealing Lord De Guise's wrongful imprisonment and perhaps exposing someone close to his Lordship, the acting company must make a self-sacrificing decision. And it is during this time that Nicholas' dirty little secret about why he left his hometown comes seeping out.More a character piece than its labeled ""thriller/action"" genre, The Reckoning has some strong performances from Dafoe, Cox, Bettany and the perfectly evil Cassel.The downside to the story is that it takes a while (quite a while) to get moving.

827420,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B000291Q52,elena maria vidal,"[8, 8]","I had not even heard of Paul McGuigan's ""The Reckoning"" (2003) until I stumbled upon it last Christmas on a cable channel. I was intrigued by the plot involving a medieval troupe of players and a fallen priest. Last night we rented the DVD and were genuinely impressed by the levels of meaning and mystery in this morality play within a morality play. Paul Bettany stars as the lapsed cleric, whose career as a wise pastor and brilliant preacher are destroyed by an affair with a woman parishioner and the subsequent, unintended murder of her indignant husband. Bettany conveys the inner torment of guilt and struggle for redemption of one anointed to God's service. Even in his defrocked state, Father Nicholas strives for truth, justice, and the salvation of others. He cannot escape the Divine call.The movie opens with the words from Romans 8: 21: ""We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose."" God can bring good out of the worst situations, as Father Nicholas' discovers when he is adopted by the band of traveling players, with Willem Dafoe as the gifted leading actor. Dafoe is a master of his craft, as always. The film shows how medieval theater was an extension of religious worship, as the Bible stories are dramatized in ""mystery plays"" at festivals. In this case, as in Hamlet, the play becomes a means of solving a brutal murder, a deed which has traumatized the inhabitants of an English village. The heart of the mystery lies in the imposing Norman fortress on the mountain, and Father Nicholas will not rest until justice is done, hoping to expiate his own crime.""The Reckoning"" boasts of authentic sets and costumes, many examples of wholesome Catholic piety (as well as some exaggerated ones), and the not-so-wonderful examples of medieval bawdiness, blasphemy, disease, and dirt. My main criticism of the film is that in the beginning it states that Church and state were united in oppressing the masses, when we know that there were many, many times that various saints of the Church defended the people from tyrants. There were good priests, bishops, and kings in the Middle Ages; even in the movie it shows the king's officers being the arbiters of justice, investigating reports of abuses. In our own enlightened times, we are not without oppressive barons, and innocent lives are still sacrificed to lust.",4,A journey to redemption,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2407,"['had', 'not', 'even', 'heard', 'Paul', 'McGuigan', 'Reckoning', '2003', 'stumbled', 'last', 'Christmas', 'cable', 'channel', 'was', 'intrigued', 'plot', 'involving', 'medieval', 'troupe', 'players', 'fallen', 'priest', 'Last', 'night', 'rented', 'DVD', 'were', 'genuinely', 'impressed', 'levels', 'meaning', 'mystery', 'morality', 'play', 'morality', 'play', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'lapsed', 'cleric', 'career', 'wise', 'pastor', 'brilliant', 'preacher', 'are', 'destroyed', 'affair', 'woman', 'parishioner', 'subsequent', 'unintended', 'murder', 'indignant', 'husband', 'Bettany', 'conveys', 'inner', 'torment', 'guilt', 'struggle', 'redemption', 'one', 'anointed', 'God', 'service', 'Even', 'defrocked', 'state', 'Father', 'Nicholas', 'truth', 'justice', 'salvation', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'Divine', 'call.The', 'movie', 'words', 'Romans', '8', '21', 'know', 'things', 'work', 'together', 'good', 'who', 'love', 'God', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'according', 'purpose', 'God', 'can', 'bring', 'good', 'worst', 'situations', 'Father', 'Nicholas', 'discovers', 'when', 'adopted', 'band', 'traveling', 'players', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'gifted', 'leading', 'actor', 'Dafoe', 'master', 'craft', 'always', 'film', 'how', 'medieval', 'theater', 'was', 'extension', 'religious', 'worship', 'Bible', 'stories', 'are', 'dramatized', 'mystery', 'plays', 'festivals', 'case', 'Hamlet', 'play', 'means', 'solving', 'brutal', 'murder', 'deed', 'traumatized', 'inhabitants', 'English', 'village', 'heart', 'mystery', 'imposing', 'Norman', 'fortress', 'mountain', 'Father', 'Nicholas', 'will', 'not', 'rest', 'justice', 'done', 'hoping', 'expiate', 'own', 'crime', 'Reckoning', 'boasts', 'authentic', 'sets', 'costumes', 'many', 'examples', 'wholesome', 'Catholic', 'piety', 'as', 'well', 'exaggerated', 'ones', 'not-so-wonderful', 'examples', 'medieval', 'bawdiness', 'blasphemy', 'disease', 'dirt', 'main', 'criticism', 'film', 'beginning', 'Church', 'state', 'were', 'united', 'oppressing', 'masses', 'when', 'know', 'were', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'various', 'saints', 'Church', 'defended', 'people', 'tyrants', 'were', 'good', 'priests', 'bishops', 'kings', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'even', 'movie', 'king', 'officers', 'being', 'arbiters', 'justice', 'investigating', 'reports', 'abuses', 'own', 'enlightened', 'times', 'are', 'not', 'oppressive', 'barons', 'innocent', 'lives', 'are', 'still', 'sacrificed', 'lust']",N/A

827424,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B000291Q52,Get What We Give,"[7, 7]","First of all, I love period films.  Give me a period film over any other and I'm happy as I can be.  Give me a period film that is historically acurate and I'm even more delighted.  This film does both.The acting is superb.  The sets are absolutely dynamite.  The costumes are great if not quite as filthy as I think things really were. The overall story just isn't all that good.Paul Bettany as an outcast priest with a secret is really excellent.  Willam Dafoe is good as usual, but I found him to be somewhat unbelievable in this role.Frankly, my chief complaint is the way in which the film is presented.  It is told matter-of-factly from the perspective of the actors. I'd rather it been a bit more atmospheric and less bright (cinematically speaking).  There were not nearly enough fires burning inside buildings (remember France is as cold as the dickens in the fall and winter).  I don't think the desperate situation of the hunger and starvation of the peasants was played up enough.The story is oddly not one that is terribly unique.  Back in the early 1980's there was a film very similar:  The Name of the Rose with Sean Connery.This film is really quite good, but is almost an attempt to create a CSI set in the dark ages.I'd rather have seen a climax that was a bit different - I won't give it away.... but it would have been really cool to see retribution for the crimes play out by having the guilty party come down with the plague and then be killed - sort of a one two punch.Anyway.

Directed by Paul McGuigar in an adaptation from Barry Unwroth's fine novel ""Morality Play"", this reincarnation of the late 1300s in England shows all the bad and some of the good of the Middle Ages, a period that has intrigued writers for centuries.  Paul Bettany plays a defrocked priest who, despite his obvious holy guidance of his poor congregation, commits adultery ( and another dark secret) and flees his village for his life.  He joins up with a troop of actors as they are burying their founder.  The new chief (Willem Dafoe - in a role that allows his gifts as a tender actor to shine), finding the newly created hole in his cast in need of filling, invites the renegade priest to join the troop. The actors (which include such fine luminaries as Brian Cox, Gina McKee, et al) have mixed reactions to new man, but eventually they bond, travel together until they become lost (taking the road less taken...?fate?), only to end up in a city dark with mystery.  A woman (beautiful and sensitive Elvira Minguez) is to be hanged for the murder of a young boy and the acting troop, convinced of her innocence, decides to present the story of the murder on the stage.  In the castle above the town lives the evil Lord de Guise (perfectly oily as played by Vincent Cassel) and as the players draw the townspeople into their play, the lord strikes out to hide the truth about the murders.  In the ensuing conflicts the triumph of truth and good over evil is the means through which the priest, the townspeople, the actors and indeed everyone involved in this morality play come to their own self realization and, in some cases, redemption.  If at times the viewer is asked to ponder a lot of philosophical and religious information, so much the better, because this is a morality play that merits such thoughtful attention.  The settings  (filmed in both Spain and the UK) are beautifully atmospheric and well captured by the camera crew.  The acting is first class (Paul Bettany has never been better), the story is superb.

827430,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000291Q52,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","""The Reckoning"" is based on the novel ""Morality Play"" by Barry Unsowrth.  A morality play was a theatrical allegory that was popular in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries.  They involved a protagonist who is met by the personification of moral attributes, such as ""Conscience,"" who try to persuade him to live a Godly life rather than follow the path of evil.  The morality plays grew out of the religiously based mystery and miracle plays and are important in theater history because they represent a key shift to secular drama.  ""The Reckoning"" is a fictional tale about the first such morality play, so it reminds me of ""Stage Beauty,"" a recent film that depicts the beginning of method acting, as well as older films like ""In the Name of the Rose,"" because of both its medieval setting and the fact that there is a murder mystery at the heart of the tale.Nicolas (Paul Bettany), a priest who must flee after being caught in the act of adultery, joins a company of players headed by Martin (Willem Dafoe).  Martin's father has just died and Nicolas is able to join the troupe because they need somebody to play the bit parts.  But when Nicolas is able to give Martin's father a Christian burial (they cannot afford to pay for the rites), a bond is established between the two men.  However, the miracle plays they perform are no longer drawing the crowds or the money they need to survive, so Martin proposes they give the people what they might want to see.  A dramatization about the murder of a local boy by a witch who has been sentenced to death.  The players find out enough about the case to be able to present it to the town, but Martin and Nicolas have suspicions that the woman has been falsely convicted, and when they perform the play it becomes clear the townspeople know more about the crime than anyone is saying.  The murder of the boy is but one of several in recent years.What the players have done is dangerous.  Tobias (Brian Cox), the oldest of the players thinks that simply dramatizing something that is not in the Bible oversteps the line.  The King's Justice (Matthew MacFadyen) pointedly tells Nicolas to drop the matter and leave town.  The truth is out there, but learning it and revealing it could be a death sentence.  But for Nicolas it is not just that the girl, Martha (Elvira M&iacute;nguez), is innocent and that she has a name.  My performing their play Martin has given her hope, and that brings with it an obligation to see the matter through, no matter what the cost to body and soul.The story told in ""The Reckoning"" moves along at a nice clip and ultimately the whodunit part of the story overwhelms the lessons of theater history, but the performance of these medieval dramas is quite fascinating (I have seen such a play performed live, ""The York Crucifixion,"" but as theater comes today being able to do so is rare).  I also liked that the story is set so far in the past that knowledge about such simple things as what happens to a body when it is hung or after death are vital clues.  Nicolas does not know everything, but as a priest he knows more than most people, and seeing a murder mystery in which the clues are so basic at a time when Patricia Cornwell and ""CSI: Las Vegas"" make forensic investigation cutting edge science was rather refreshing.Paul McGuigan did this film before he directed ""Wicker Park,"" and he recreates the squalor of peasant life at that period.  The final performance of the morality play not only takes place at night by torchlight, but as snow begins to fall.  Bettany and Dafoe play well off of each other, representing idealism and practicality that bring out the best in each other, and M&iacute;nguez as the mute Martha has a quite effective scene when she is questioned about the murder.  However, the casting of this film also gave away a key part of the mystery because the Lord De Guise is played by Vincent Cassel, who played Gilles de Rais in ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc.""  The latter was a French aristocrat and national hero who was later convicted of torturing, raping and murdering hundreds of children.  Seeing Cassel in the role of De Guise suggested an instant connection to me, and while I know my interpretation is idiosyncratic, it did effect how I enjoyed the film.  Regardless, this was a captivating film and it easy to see why the talent was drawn to the script.",4,The first morality play becomes pivotal in a medieval murder mystery,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,4387,"['Reckoning', 'based', 'novel', 'Morality', 'Play', 'Barry', 'Unsowrth', 'morality', 'play', 'was', 'theatrical', 'allegory', 'was', 'popular', 'Europe', '15th', '16th', 'centuries', 'involved', 'protagonist', 'who', 'met', 'personification', 'moral', 'attributes', 'such', 'Conscience', 'who', 'try', 'persuade', 'live', 'Godly', 'life', 'rather', 'follow', 'path', 'evil', 'morality', 'grew', 'religiously', 'based', 'mystery', 'miracle', 'plays', 'are', 'important', 'theater', 'history', 'represent', 'key', 'shift', 'secular', 'drama', 'Reckoning', 'fictional', 'tale', 'first', 'such', 'morality', 'play', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'recent', 'film', 'beginning', 'method', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'older', 'films', 'Name', 'Rose', 'medieval', 'setting', 'fact', 'murder', 'mystery', 'heart', 'tale.Nicolas', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'priest', 'who', 'must', 'flee', 'being', 'caught', 'act', 'adultery', 'company', 'players', 'headed', 'Martin', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Martin', 'father', 'just', 'died', 'Nicolas', 'able', 'join', 'troupe', 'need', 'somebody', 'play', 'bit', 'parts', 'when', 'Nicolas', 'able', 'give', 'Martin', 'father', 'Christian', 'burial', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'pay', 'rites', 'bond', 'established', 'two', 'men', 'However', 'miracle', 'perform', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'drawing', 'crowds', 'money', 'need', 'survive', 'Martin', 'give', 'people', 'what', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'dramatization', 'murder', 'local', 'boy', 'witch', 'who', 'been', 'sentenced', 'death', 'players', 'find', 'out', 'enough', 'case', 'be', 'able', 'present', 'town', 'Martin', 'Nicolas', 'have', 'suspicions', 'woman', 'been', 'falsely', 'convicted', 'when', 'perform', 'play', 'clear', 'townspeople', 'know', 'more', 'crime', 'anyone', 'saying', 'murder', 'boy', 'one', 'several', 'recent', 'players', 'have', 'done', 'dangerous', 'Tobias', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'oldest', 'players', 'thinks', 'simply', 'dramatizing', 'something', 'not', 'Bible', 'line', 'King', 'Justice', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'pointedly', 'Nicolas', 'drop', 'matter', 'leave', 'town', 'truth', 'there', 'learning', 'revealing', 'could', 'be', 'death', 'sentence', 'Nicolas', 'not', 'just', 'girl', 'Martha', 'Elvira', 'M', 'iacute', 'innocent', 'name', 'performing', 'play', 'Martin', 'given', 'hope', 'obligation', 'see', 'matter', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'body', 'soul.The', 'story', 'told', 'Reckoning', 'along', 'nice', 'clip', 'ultimately', 'whodunit', 'part', 'story', 'lessons', 'theater', 'history', 'performance', 'medieval', 'dramas', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'have', 'seen', 'play', 'performed', 'live', 'York', 'Crucifixion', 'theater', 'today', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'rare', 'also', 'liked', 'story', 'set', 'so', 'far', 'past', 'knowledge', 'such', 'simple', 'things', 'what', 'body', 'when', 'hung', 'death', 'are', 'vital', 'clues', 'Nicolas', 'not', 'know', 'everything', 'priest', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'seeing', 'murder', 'mystery', 'clues', 'are', 'so', 'basic', 'time', 'when', 'Patricia', 'Cornwell', 'CSI', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'make', 'forensic', 'investigation', 'cutting', 'edge', 'science', 'was', 'rather', 'refreshing.Paul', 'McGuigan', 'did', 'film', 'directed', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'squalor', 'peasant', 'life', 'period', 'final', 'performance', 'morality', 'play', 'not', 'only', 'place', 'night', 'torchlight', 'snow', 'fall', 'Bettany', 'Dafoe', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'representing', 'idealism', 'practicality', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'other', 'M', 'iacute', 'mute', 'Martha', 'quite', 'effective', 'scene', 'when', 'questioned', 'murder', 'However', 'casting', 'film', 'also', 'gave', 'away', 'key', 'part', 'mystery', 'Lord', 'De', 'Guise', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'who', 'played', 'Gilles', 'de', 'Rais', 'Messenger', 'Story', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'latter', 'was', 'French', 'aristocrat', 'national', 'hero', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'convicted', 'torturing', 'raping', 'murdering', 'hundreds', 'children', 'Seeing', 'Cassel', 'role', 'De', 'Guise', 'suggested', 'instant', 'connection', 'know', 'interpretation', 'idiosyncratic', 'did', 'effect', 'how', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Regardless', 'was', 'captivating', 'film', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'talent', 'was', 'drawn', 'script']",N/A
827431,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000291Q52,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 5]","This Spanish production of ""The Reckoning"" is an excellent film.  Paul McGuigan also directed ""Wicker Park"" in 2004. Fortunately, this one works and coherently tells the tale.  I particularly loved how it built to its climax, swooping the viewer along in the reality of the drama, until the final moment.  McGuigan's ""Gangster No. 1"" was also an extremely interesting picture that also starred Paul Bettany; so this is their second pairing of which I'm aware.  Based on the novel ""Morality Play"" by Barry Unsworth, the story tells of a defrocked priest, a fugitive, who joins a wandering group of theatrical players.  I enjoyed the theatre history which seemed authentic with the wagon as their stage and the low status that actors enjoyed during this time period.  Paul Bettany has showed a diverse range with amazing ability and will surely be a breakthrough star in the near future.  In ""Wimbledon"" he was the romantic lead in that light comedy; in ""Gangster No. 1"" he was quite believably a ruthless killer; in ""Dogville"" with Nicole Kidman he was the sensitive neighbor; in ""The Heart of Me"" he was an unhappy & unfaithful husband; and here he is an intense and brooding man of faith.  His performance is edgy and carries the picture.  Willem Dafoe has twice been nominated for Best Supporting actor, ""Platoon"" in 1986 & ""Shadow of the Vampire"" in 2000.  Whether he's playing the villain in ""Spiderman"" or the brooding kidnapper with Robert Redford in ""The Clearing,"" he always brings a great intensity to his role.  As Martin, the leader of the troupe of actors, he adds depth to a part that easily could have been more superficially performed.  I also have to admit that I was amazed at how limber he is doing a handstand!  One of the shining performances in the film comes from Spanish actress Elvira Minguez as the mute woman accused of murder.  Her eyes speak volumes in this part, communicating a great range of feeling.  Gina McKee from ""Notting Hill"" and ""Wonderland"" plays Sarah, the sister of Martin who gets a crush on Paul Bettany's character.  Brian Cox who was riveting as the bad guy in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and also played in ""Troy"" & ""The Ring"" does a great job as the older member of the troupe, slow to change.  French actor Vincent Cassel first came to my attention in ""Birthday Girl"" with Nicole Kidman and then totally captured my interest in ""Read My Lips,"" a film about a deaf woman who witnesses a crime and helps a small-time gangster.  His rugged looks often typecast him as a gangster (""Oceans 12""); and here he plays the sleazy Lord de Guise who embodies pure evil and has a penchant for violating young boys.  From the excellent pacing of this film, the great look of the cinematography, and the penetrating performances, I found this to be an excellent production. The DVD does not offer many extras, which is somewhat of a disappointment.  However, the movie is excellent!

Upon discovering, however, this accused woman, they quickly change their approach--from the staging of a traditional Bible-based work to one portraying the events leading up to the murder of the young boy, supposedly done by the mute woman.What makes this film so powerful is a combination of strong acting (from Brian Cox, Willem Dafoe, Paul Bettany, Vincent Cassel, and several others) and especially a story that intertwines the juxtaposition of faith embraced externally based on organized religion and morality affirmed within oneself based on internal conviction. This juxtaposition is combined with the ever-present reality of politics--as typified here by a feudal lord--and its attendant corruption, as well as that of the Church which revels in its power over commoners.One of the more compelling things about this film is that it wastes no time in getting right to the story. The viewer is quickly thrust into the meat of the story and events ensue with perfect pacing that keeps the viewer intrigued right up to the last frame. What's also interesting is that the director, Paul McGuigan, has here fashioned a film radically different from his other recent work (Gangster No. 1, Lucky Number Slevin), certainly in setting at least, and has done an excellent job. The music in particular is very strong; the two composers, Adrian Lee and Mark Mancina, are to be complimented for providing an especially appropriate and riveting score.The production, set design, and costuming are all superior and while the speech has obviously been modernized, as another reviewer pointed out, if the actors had been speaking the actual lingo of the time no viewer would have been able to understand them without subtitles. From my perspective, this too can be forgiven along with the historical inaccuracies (e.g., timing of the plague and the Crusades, etc.)The novel on which this is based is Morality Play by Barry Unsworth--perhaps a more fitting title. Without quibbling about details like this, The Reckoning is a very strong piece of work that should be seen--something very different in films of the last five to ten years. Some reviewers have pointed out the similarity to Name of the Rose, and to some extent this is accurate. But The Reckoning, I believe, is different enough to merit consideration on its own.Highly recommended.",5,Compelling drama,1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,2951,"['true', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'central', 'theme', 'story', 'here.Set', 'England', 'ca', '1380', 'Reckoning', 'unraveling', 'mystery', 'exoneration', 'mute', 'woman', 'accused', 'townsfolk', 'murder', 'psychologically', 'connected', 'man', 'who', 'essence', 'innocence', 'man', 'young', 'disgraced', 'priest', 'come', 'town', 'troupe', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'increase', 'extremely', 'modest', 'finances', 'staging', 'morality', 'play', 'discovering', 'however', 'accused', 'woman', 'quickly', 'change', 'approach', 'staging', 'traditional', 'Bible-based', 'work', 'one', 'portraying', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'murder', 'young', 'boy', 'supposedly', 'done', 'mute', 'film', 'so', 'powerful', 'combination', 'strong', 'acting', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'several', 'others', 'especially', 'story', 'juxtaposition', 'faith', 'embraced', 'externally', 'based', 'organized', 'religion', 'morality', 'affirmed', 'based', 'internal', 'conviction', 'juxtaposition', 'combined', 'ever-present', 'reality', 'politics', 'typified', 'here', 'feudal', 'lord', 'attendant', 'corruption', 'as', 'well', 'Church', 'power', 'commoners.One', 'more', 'compelling', 'things', 'film', 'time', 'getting', 'right', 'story', 'viewer', 'quickly', 'thrust', 'meat', 'story', 'events', 'ensue', 'perfect', 'pacing', 'viewer', 'intrigued', 'right', 'up', 'last', 'frame', 'What', 'also', 'interesting', 'director', 'Paul', 'McGuigan', 'here', 'fashioned', 'film', 'radically', 'different', 'other', 'recent', 'work', 'Gangster', 'No', '1', 'Lucky', 'Number', 'Slevin', 'certainly', 'setting', 'least', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'music', 'particular', 'very', 'strong', 'two', 'composers', 'Adrian', 'Lee', 'Mark', 'Mancina', 'are', 'be', 'complimented', 'providing', 'especially', 'appropriate', 'riveting', 'score.The', 'production', 'set', 'design', 'costuming', 'are', 'superior', 'speech', 'obviously', 'been', 'modernized', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'actors', 'had', 'been', 'speaking', 'actual', 'lingo', 'time', 'viewer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'understand', 'subtitles', 'perspective', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'e.g.', 'timing', 'plague', 'Crusades', 'etc', 'novel', 'based', 'Morality', 'Play', 'Barry', 'Unsworth', 'perhaps', 'more', 'fitting', 'title', 'quibbling', 'about', 'details', 'Reckoning', 'very', 'strong', 'piece', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'last', 'five', 'ten', 'years', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'similarity', 'Name', 'Rose', 'extent', 'accurate', 'Reckoning', 'believe', 'different', 'enough', 'merit', 'consideration', 'own.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Within a small story, not of kings or rich men, but poor players at one of medieval England's darkest hours historically--the novel examines not only crime and the abuse of power but the opening of the medieval mind and the birth of a new art form. It's rare and wonderful to find a historical novelist creating an appealing  work of fiction --one that is set within a certain time frame but doesn't detail every aspect of the period and transcends it with a universally appealing--well , morality tale--without once succumbing to melodrama.In the book, the young priest was a witness to to the story--and the story itself was driven by the imagination of the lead player, Martin, and his love for the condemned woman--accused of a heinous crime.Here, we needlessly get the noble (they literally elevated him to the nobility in this  version) ninja priest driving the action, and a storyline focusing on the power aspects primarily, ending with a ridiculous showdown.

Paul Bettany plays the role of a priest who has been discovered in an act of adultery and has to run for his life.  He meets up with a traveling troupe of actors whose leader is Willem Dafoe, and the group enters a town in the hope of making a few shillings and having their traveling cart repaired.The townspeople are not interested in their play because there is a real life drama unfolding around them.  A mute woman is accused of witchcraft and sentenced to hang for the murder of a young boy.  The players decide to produce a play about that incident and Willem Dafoe visits her in her jail cell where she tells her story through sign language.  Convinced of her innocence, they produce a new play.  But naturally there are complications.Filmed in Spain and England, the feeling of the times, and especially of the dirt, disease and poverty are captured well.  The story is a good one although a little hard to follow.  But, by the end, however, I understood it perfectly.  Acting was uniformly good and I did feel the complexities of such an ambitious plot.  However, the film editing could have been better.  In one scene particularly, there were a few discordant spots that would have been better left on the cutting room floor.Also, in spite of the attempts of the producers, this was no Shakespearean play.  And although I did enjoy it, it was always from an outsider's perspective.  I never really got caught up in the emotion.I was also hoping for some extras on the DVD because I would have liked to go a little bit behind the scenes.

827435,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000291Q52,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[0, 0]","The Reckoning is a fairly unique movie. It's a medieval tale that explores the world of Passion Plays along with murder mysteries. You get interesting insight into how the feudal system worked, into justice in medieval times, and how actors were slowly changing the way performances were handled.We have a number of famous actors here. Willem Dafoe, always one of my favorites. Paul Bettany. Vincent Cassel, who played the Night Fox in the Ocean's Eleven series. Matthew Macfadyen from Pride & Prejudice. Good stuff.A group of actors comes into a remote castle village, merely by chance, and puts on some plays to earn some money. At this time, plays were seen only legitimate if they told stories from the Bible. It was considered inappropriate to tell &#34;made up&#34; stories. But Willem's character thinks that should change. He thinks that other stories can be just as important. And, as it turns out, this village has a story to tell. A young boy has been murdered.There are investigations and intrigues, suspicions and suspects.I love sword fighting, so I should mention that there really aren't any here. This is more of a &#34;Name of the Rose&#34; sleuthing story than a hack-and-bash story. That's quite fine, of course.I also love stories that have both male and female characters in them, and it's a bit sad, but there are pretty much no females in this story. There's the woman accused of murder who has a brief part. There's also a female who is a member of the troupe, but she's actively dismissed and pushed aside. So that's a bit of a shame. Women in medieval times were fairly strong characters, and they had a lot of respect. When the men were away at the Crusades, women ran pretty much everything. They weren't quite treated as much as dirt as this movie makes it out to be.The interiors of the castle scenes were played at Hedingham Castle, in Essex, England, but interestingly, the entire exterior is fake! These are actually the Rodalquilar gold mines in Almeira, Spain. The director converted the entire gold mine complex into a medieval village, including building a keep. You can see some photos of that by googling. Cool stuff.I enjoy watching Willem Dafoe's amazing yoga skills in some of those scenes. No, that's not a stunt double. He really can do a standing backbend, a standing handstand, and many other feats at his mature age. It's inspirational.If there's a down side to this movie, it's the ending. I don't want to give it away, of course, but the cutting and sequencing and camerawork are AWFUL during it. There are times people talk but their lips don't move. Other times they don't talk but their lips are moving. Very, very odd and rushed. It's a letdown after you get invested in what is going on.Still, a good look at the evolution of Passion Plays, at some fairly good recreations of a medieval village, and a glimpse into how characters lived and loved during medieval times. Certainly a step above the movies that have characters in polyester tights :).",4,Good View of Medieval Life with a Few Issues,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,3002,"['Reckoning', 'fairly', 'unique', 'movie', 'medieval', 'tale', 'world', 'Passion', 'Plays', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'get', 'interesting', 'insight', 'how', 'feudal', 'system', 'worked', 'justice', 'medieval', 'times', 'how', 'actors', 'were', 'slowly', 'changing', 'way', 'performances', 'were', 'handled.We', 'have', 'number', 'famous', 'actors', 'here', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'always', 'one', 'favorites', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'who', 'played', 'Night', 'Fox', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'series', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Good', 'stuff.A', 'group', 'actors', 'remote', 'castle', 'village', 'merely', 'chance', 'plays', 'earn', 'money', 'time', 'plays', 'were', 'seen', 'only', 'legitimate', 'told', 'stories', 'Bible', 'was', 'considered', 'inappropriate', 'tell', '34', 'made', 'up', '34', 'stories', 'Willem', 'character', 'should', 'change', 'other', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'important', 'out', 'village', 'story', 'tell', 'young', 'boy', 'been', 'are', 'investigations', 'intrigues', 'suspicions', 'suspects.I', 'love', 'sword', 'fighting', 'should', 'mention', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'here', 'more', '34', 'Name', 'Rose', '34', 'sleuthing', 'story', 'hack-and-bash', 'story', 'quite', 'fine', 'course.I', 'also', 'love', 'stories', 'have', 'male', 'female', 'characters', 'bit', 'sad', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'females', 'story', 'woman', 'accused', 'murder', 'who', 'brief', 'part', 'also', 'female', 'who', 'member', 'troupe', 'actively', 'dismissed', 'pushed', 'aside', 'bit', 'shame', 'Women', 'medieval', 'times', 'were', 'fairly', 'strong', 'characters', 'had', 'lot', 'respect', 'When', 'men', 'were', 'away', 'Crusades', 'women', 'ran', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'treated', 'as', 'much', 'dirt', 'movie', 'out', 'be.The', 'interiors', 'castle', 'scenes', 'were', 'played', 'Hedingham', 'Castle', 'Essex', 'England', 'interestingly', 'entire', 'exterior', 'fake', 'are', 'actually', 'Rodalquilar', 'gold', 'mines', 'Almeira', 'Spain', 'director', 'converted', 'entire', 'gold', 'mine', 'complex', 'medieval', 'village', 'including', 'building', 'keep', 'can', 'see', 'photos', 'googling', 'Cool', 'stuff.I', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'amazing', 'yoga', 'skills', 'scenes', 'No', 'not', 'stunt', 'double', 'really', 'can', 'do', 'standing', 'backbend', 'standing', 'handstand', 'many', 'other', 'feats', 'mature', 'age', 'inspirational.If', 'down', 'side', 'movie', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'course', 'cutting', 'sequencing', 'camerawork', 'are', 'AWFUL', 'are', 'times', 'people', 'talk', 'lips', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'Other', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'lips', 'are', 'moving', 'Very', 'very', 'odd', 'rushed', 'letdown', 'get', 'invested', 'what', 'going', 'on.Still', 'good', 'look', 'evolution', 'Passion', 'Plays', 'fairly', 'good', 'recreations', 'medieval', 'village', 'glimpse', 'how', 'characters', 'lived', 'loved', 'medieval', 'times', 'Certainly', 'step', 'movies', 'have', 'characters', 'polyester', 'tights']",N/A

Set in England of 1380, it finds Nicholas (Paul Bettany), a disgraced priest carrying a dark secret, fleeing his parish. Nicholas joins up with a troupe of traveling actors led by Martin (Willhem Dafoe), am imposing and inventive lifelong actor. The troupe pulls into a village that has recently been shaken by the murder of a young boy. Desperate for a larger audience than their Biblical plays usually draw, the troupe decides to make an allegory of the events surrounding the boy's murder. But the minstrels aren't the only outsiders to take an interest in the murder investigation, and the villagers may know more of the matter than they pretend.&quot;The Reckoning&quot; is a sordid, gritty murder mystery with allegorical twist of its own. The film is certainly about reckoning: the priest's, the village's, and the murderer's. Paul Bettany and Wilhem Dafoe give strong performances. Bettany's Nicholas always feels conflicted and is perhaps a mite too neurotic for the 14th century -but then again, he is a priest caught between his faith and life's realities. Willhem Dafoe gives one of his most charismatic performances as Martin, though it's not a leading role. I'd also like to mention Matthew MacFadyen, whom I found quite striking in his small role as a King's Justice sent to the village to either play politics or catch a murderer, or both. &quot;The Reckoning&quot;'s climax is contrived and flirts with clich&eacute;. But it's dramatic nevertheless. I recommend &quot;The Reckoning&quot; to fans of period pieces and of sordid mysteries.The DVD: Subtitles are available in English only.

The plot in its initial stages retains just enough ambiguity to keep us intrigued about where exactly it is headed. Unfortunately, about midway through the film, the story addresses that very question and it turns out to be a not very satisfactory answer.  As  Nicholas becomes more and more overtly involved with solving the mystery and more and more involved in the life of the villagers, the story itself become more and more contrived and melodramatic.  We simply don't believe much of what we see happening on the screen, neither the acting troupe's dramatization of the events nor Nicholas' face-to-face confrontation with the evil lord of the city.  The scenes in the story are put forward in such a theatrical way that the film begins to feel less like real life and more like the movies.  It probably doesn't help that Bettany and Willem Dafoe as the head of the actor's ensemble deliver fairly bland, lackluster performances.I wanted to like ""The Reckoning"" very much, and for a while I really thought I would.

There must be a story behind how what could have been a fine movie got so botched. (Who knows what happened? Funding was pulled, ham-handed producer intervention, drugs? But isn't the director ultimately responsible? If the script was bad, he should have nixed it; or put the 'Alan Smithee' name the mess. I believe the concept was good, script flaws - clarity, continuity, characterization - could have been doctored. But in filming, concept, dialogue and production elements never come together.)The Reckoning is a period/whodunit movie, like the classicThe Name of the Rose(released in 1986, A Classic, which's why it's now selling 'new' at Amazon for almost $20, used, $8.34)Little of The Reckoning makes sense, tracks or uses the talents of its actors' skills.

I first saw the film in 2001 more than two years before its blink-and-you'll-miss-it theatrical release, and in the interim it went through some tweaking and rescoring, although this is mainly for the better - the ending seems a little tighter (although the fate of the killer still fails to convince) and Vincent Cassell's Norman lord is introduced much earlier into the proceedings, which helps considerably (in the previous cut he was a remote, faceless presence for most of the movie), although Gina McKee's role seems less substantial than I remember.There are still problems in the film, including a couple of weak performances (the usually reliable Ewan Bremner and a flat and disinterested Matthew McFadyen in particular), and the impressive set still looks more like the Spanish mountains than the Yorkshire Dales, but there's still much to admire in this tale of a priest on the run who falls in with a group of travelling actors only to find a chance for redemption when, while performing a play about a child murder in a village, he discovers that the deaf and dumb healer sentenced to hang for the crime is clearly innocent. Paul Bettany is fine in the lead, although Willem Dafoe inadvisedly succombs to the siren call of attempting a Yorkshire accent and ending up with something very odd indeed (previous victims include Donald Sutherland in 'Revolution'), and you can even spot 'Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg in a brief bit as a gaoler.

That part is there for you to be revealed at the end of the film, but before you know the answer of the mystery part of the film, you'll understand what this slightly talky but thematically riveting film is all about.In the introductory chapter Paul Bettany, a priest Nicholas living in the 14th century England will be seen preaching and then running in the woods desperately. You might feel a bit boring watching this part, but please wait. The real story gets underway when Nicholas encounters a traveling band of actors. After the vote by the band's members, the troupe accepts Nicholas as the actor to fill the vacant post.One very interesting twist can be found in the following part of the story. The actors arrive at the village where a woman is going to be executed for murder. The actors, pushed for money, decide to perform a new piece on stage based on this murder case, in which they re-enact the imagined process up to the murder. Their exploitation, however, ends up with unexpected reaction from the audience, which makes Nicholas think the possibility of the error of justice.Director Paul McGuigan (`Gangster No.1' and `Lucky Number Slevin"") poses questions about the nature of art and justice, the questions that are more intriguing than the answers. The film is thought-provoking, offering clever allegories (such as overlapping of mystery as religion and mystery as whodunit), but the concluding part spends too much time to solve the latter kind of `mystery' - I mean, detective story.The film is all in all well-acted, but the casting is not perfect. If you can accept French Vincent Cassel as Lord De Guise, ruler of the village, you may not still find Willem Defoe the best choice as the leader of the troupe traveling around the medieval England. With British actors like Paul Bettany, Brian Cox, Gena McKee, and Ewen Bremner around him, Dafoe looks quite out of place ... well, at least to me, of course.The picture is shot beautifully with well-balanced use of less light and more darkness, and the production designs of the 14th century England are convincing.

Mix in murder and a young peasant boy doesn't have much of a chance. ""The Reckoning"" based on Barry Unsworth's novel ""A Morality Play"" takes place during this time. A disgraced priest named Nicholas(Paul Bettany) on the run falls in with a traveling group of actors. He's adopted by the actors as they are a player short and they need someone for their next performance. Martin (Willem DaFoe) the leader of the troup wants to break with telling their usual bible stories. When they stumble across the murder of a young boy and the arrest of Martha (Elvira Minguez) a deaf mute accused of killing the boy, Martin has his perfect opportunity to put on his topical, original play.As Nicholas unravels the story of Martha, he begins to suspect that she had nothing to do with the boys murder. Nicholas and the performers cause the mystery to unravel itself by performing their ""version"" of events. The play reveals cracks in the story of the murder and a wall of silence about the true nature of the killing.With unusually vivid and sharp performances all around, ""The Reckoning"" does resemble ""The Name of the Rose"" but only superficially. ""The Name of the Rose"" focuses much more on the murder mystery whereas ""The Reconking"" looks at how the truth is uncovered and the impact it has on a community and on a priest who has lost his faith in God. Contrary to some other reviews, this film isn't set in France (Richard is King clearly indicating that this is England)and the performances including that of Dafoe are excellent. Although Dafoe's accent isn't perfect, the film is made up of a variety of accents (most of them Irish, English or Scottish)with a smattering of other ones as well. With a supporting cast made up of the marvelous Tom hardy, Brian Cox (""Manhunter"", ""The Bourne Conspiracy""), Stuart Wells and Gina McKee (""Notting Hill""), ""The Reckoning"" will keep your interest despite the fact that it's not cut like a rapid pace thriller. It's leisurely pacing will take a bit of getting used to at first for some but once the story unfolds, you'll be sucked right in.I'm a bit disappointed that Paramount chose to release this no frills version of the film. This recalls their earlier releases without any extras (except for the trailer). While the transfer looks very good there is some minor edge enhancement that mars some scenes (causing a halo effect during some of the darkest sequences in particular). The film sounds terrific and the widescreen anamorphic transfer does justice to the vivid and colorful images.Although it isn't a perfect film, it's a fascinating thriller about the rediscovery of one man's moral compass and sense of self.
