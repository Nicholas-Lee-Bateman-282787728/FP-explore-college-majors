I disagree, a good film should entertain, and that is what this film does very well.  Nice on location sets give the film an authentic and attractive feel.  The acting is top notch.  The two main overlapping stories, the father & daughter relationship and the legal battle, tie in very nicely.

868084,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B0006HBZBA,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 8/06Rate: 98/06: Class Action contained a great story and strong acting performances by Gene Hackman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. It is a very complex film to watch with high rewards of pleasure for watching, and the ending is just great. Class Action is directed adroitly by Michael Apted, who has a nice resume of films. The story is unbelievably great, and yes...the writing, that's a stellar work. I loved how the conflict is so real when there is the father-daughter lawyers on the opposing sides to emerge out in Class Action. That brought out the stuff of greats in the past pictures. Exactly what makes a film works is the elements of the story. It turned out to be so darned interesting in Class Action that everything else fell into place, and the length of the film didn't matter anymore. That's the spirit of a film: making the picture totally watchable. Both Gene Hackman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio deserved a good deal of credit. It's sad that films like this don't get recognized very well. I am very glad to gain a glimpse in the early acting performance of Laurence Fishburne, and he is a phenomenal actor when he does this type of work.

868097,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0006HBZBA,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 8]","Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is.What robs this courtroom thriller is what's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way, an actual case in controversy.  Maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture, Hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them.  Instead of a compelling case, we have one that's ready for our verdict as soon as we've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices.  The case in ""Class Action"" is one you can typify as ""David & Goliath"", which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power.  There's no way that we're going to see a case won (even by dishonest means) by Donald Moffat's hired band of Harvard-trained professional liars, and there's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments.  Maggie's bosses are so transparently bad, that not only do they screw up, but even their explanations are patently evil  Even so, the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery, and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless.

Shingleton ""Wishful Thinking Is No...","[20, 21]","There are really two kinds of lawyer films out there; the kind that is about the trial and the kind that is about the lawyers; this film is about the lawyers and the family drama of a father and daughter pitted against each other in a class action lawsuit.  The film is well constructed and acted, though there is the occasional corny dialoge in the father-daughter scenes that could have been written much stronger.The father (played by Gene Hackman) is a crusading support-the-little-guy type, but he is not without his warts and particularly not without the consequences of his giant ego.  Hackman is perfect in this role and gives his character the depth it deserves.  Mary Elizabeth Masterantonio plays the daughter and is really the center of the film since it is her evolution more than Hackman's that drives the plot.  She more than holds her own against a much more experienced actor and gives the film credibility.There are a few witty remarks in the film but I can't say that the dialogue crackles; since this is not an action film, the dialogue is how the film moves along, so that's a shame.  But the plot is enthralling and takes a few unexpected twists at the end; combined with the solid cast (this was shot so long ago that Fred Dalton Thompson was not yet a senator and Lawrence Fishbourne is listed as Larry) it makes the film engaging and certainly worth the low price of this DVD.The DVD itself is disappointing and carries no special features to speak of (trailers for this film and other movies DO NOT count as special features, at least in my opinion).  The only reason to get the DVD versus the tape is that it's easier to find and will hold up better over time.The bottom line is that this is a solid, well acted film whose David versus Goliath, Inc theme rings even more true in the post-Enron universe than it did when the film first came out.",4,A Family Drama Set in a Courtroom,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,1871,"['are', 'really', 'two', 'kinds', 'lawyer', 'films', 'there', 'kind', 'trial', 'kind', 'lawyers', 'film', 'lawyers', 'family', 'drama', 'father', 'daughter', 'pitted', 'other', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'film', 'well', 'constructed', 'acted', 'occasional', 'corny', 'dialoge', 'father-daughter', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'much', 'stronger.The', 'father', 'played', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'crusading', 'support-the-little-guy', 'type', 'not', 'warts', 'particularly', 'not', 'consequences', 'giant', 'ego', 'Hackman', 'perfect', 'role', 'character', 'depth', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Masterantonio', 'daughter', 'really', 'center', 'film', 'evolution', 'more', 'Hackman', 'plot', 'more', 'own', 'much', 'more', 'experienced', 'actor', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'witty', 'remarks', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'dialogue', 'crackles', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'dialogue', 'how', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'shame', 'plot', 'enthralling', 'few', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'end', 'combined', 'solid', 'cast', 'was', 'shot', 'so', 'long', 'Fred', 'Dalton', 'Thompson', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'senator', 'Lawrence', 'Fishbourne', 'listed', 'Larry', 'film', 'engaging', 'certainly', 'low', 'price', 'DVD.The', 'DVD', 'disappointing', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'trailers', 'film', 'other', 'movies', 'DO', 'NOT', 'count', 'special', 'features', 'least', 'opinion', 'only', 'reason', 'get', 'DVD', 'tape', 'easier', 'find', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'better', 'time.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'solid', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'David', 'versus', 'Goliath', 'Inc', 'theme', 'rings', 'even', 'more', 'true', 'post-Enron', 'universe', 'did', 'when', 'film', 'first', 'came', 'out']",N/A
