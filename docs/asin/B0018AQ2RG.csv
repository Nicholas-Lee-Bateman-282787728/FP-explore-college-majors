1159158,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0018AQ2RG,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","I'm ready for them to retire this idea. It's sad, because I'm one of those people who actually thinks the original `Meet the Parents' was rather priceless. I include Robert De Niro on my longlist for Lead Actor in 2000 and consider the film itself utterly hysterical with rarely a flaw to be had. The sequel was a bit of a repeat, regurgitating a lot of the same scenarios and growing tiresome with the whole `Jack vs. Greg' angle, but it introduced us to Greg's parents who were gloriously brought to life by Streisand and Hoffman. As much as I don't adore the second film, I can't deny that I was entertained by it.This film was a nightmare.The film proves that there is no originality to be found in this story anymore and so it really needs to be retired. In fact, it cements the idea that the original film should have just been left alone entirely. The `Jack Byrnes is a control freak who doesn't trust Greg despite how many times he's been wrong about him' idea is so overdone now that it feels insulting to keep bringing it up.Can't you think of anything else to do?The story revolves around Jack's heart problems and how they bring him to the realization that he may die soon and he needs another strong male to lead the family. Doctor Bob is out since he's a cheating scoundrel who left Jack's `other' daughter. The only one left is Greg, and he's a nurse so he can't be that good; right? Everything unravels when Jack and Dina visit for the twins (yes, Greg and Pam have kids now) birthday party. Next thing you know, Jack is questioning his decision because he suspects Greg of having an affair and soon Kevin is heartbroken on their doorstep subtly hinting towards his undying love for Pam and Jack is trying to convince the family that Greg is a loser and Pam should leave him for Kevin.So basically, this is the same story as the first two films.This is just poorly conceived. At least Ben Stiller is funny; he's no Adam Sandler (thank GOD) but that doesn't really make this any better. Jessica Alba is a mess (seriously), De Niro does what he does but this character just needs to go away. Owen Wilson acts like his character from `Zoolander', which is an odd fit for the film, and the series is still extremely uninterested in letting us know who Pam or her mother Dina really are (is anyone else bothered by the fact that they have NOTHING to do in any of these films). Streisand and Hoffman have a few scenes, which is sad since they are far more interesting than Jack Byrnes at this point.",1,I'm tired of this...,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,2509,"[""'m"", 'ready', 'retire', 'idea', 'sad', ""'m"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'original', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'was', 'rather', 'priceless', 'include', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'longlist', 'Lead', 'Actor', '2000', 'consider', 'film', 'utterly', 'hysterical', 'rarely', 'flaw', 'be', 'had', 'sequel', 'was', 'bit', 'repeat', 'regurgitating', 'lot', 'same', 'scenarios', 'growing', 'tiresome', 'whole', 'Jack', 'vs.', 'Greg', 'angle', 'introduced', 'Greg', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'gloriously', 'brought', 'life', 'Streisand', 'Hoffman', 'As', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'adore', 'second', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'was', 'entertained', 'it.This', 'film', 'was', 'nightmare.The', 'film', 'originality', 'be', 'found', 'story', 'anymore', 'so', 'really', 'be', 'retired', 'fact', 'idea', 'original', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'left', 'alone', 'entirely', 'Jack', 'Byrnes', 'control', 'freak', 'who', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Greg', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'been', 'wrong', 'idea', 'so', 'overdone', 'now', 'insulting', 'keep', 'bringing', 'up.Ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'story', 'around', 'Jack', 'heart', 'problems', 'how', 'bring', 'realization', 'may', 'die', 'soon', 'strong', 'male', 'lead', 'family', 'Doctor', 'Bob', 'out', 'cheating', 'scoundrel', 'who', 'left', 'Jack', 'other', 'daughter', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'Greg', 'nurse', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'that', 'good', 'right', 'Everything', 'unravels', 'when', 'Jack', 'Dina', 'visit', 'twins', 'yes', 'Greg', 'Pam', 'have', 'kids', 'now', 'birthday', 'party', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'Jack', 'questioning', 'decision', 'Greg', 'having', 'affair', 'soon', 'Kevin', 'heartbroken', 'doorstep', 'subtly', 'hinting', 'undying', 'love', 'Pam', 'Jack', 'trying', 'convince', 'family', 'Greg', 'loser', 'Pam', 'should', 'leave', 'Kevin.So', 'basically', 'same', 'story', 'first', 'two', 'films.This', 'just', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'least', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'funny', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'thank', 'GOD', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'better', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'mess', 'seriously', 'De', 'Niro', 'what', 'character', 'just', 'go', 'away', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'character', 'Zoolander', 'odd', 'fit', 'film', 'series', 'still', 'extremely', 'uninterested', 'letting', 'know', 'who', 'Pam', 'mother', 'Dina', 'really', 'are', 'anyone', 'else', 'bothered', 'fact', 'have', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'films', 'Streisand', 'Hoffman', 'have', 'few', 'scenes', 'sad', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Jack', 'Byrnes', 'point']",Little Fockers

E Jackson,"[2, 3]","Just to give everyone a heads up- I'm not allowed to say the name of this movie I suppose because, well you know... the second word in the title almost resembles the king of all bad words.  As a result I had to change my wording around.  Sorry about this but it's not my decision.At first I was totally shocked to see the numerous amount of 1-star reviews for this film here on amazon, however after watching it, now I can see exactly WHY the movie is considered such an overwhelming disappointment- it's much worse than the previous ones in the series.As far as writing goes... what the heck is this?  There's really nothing clever about the jokes or the dialogue whatsoever.In fact the entire script has a ""been there, done that"" feeling (because it's basically a watered down version of the first one in the series) especially everything that Barbara Streisand participates in.  Speaking of which... Barbara was barely even in the movie.  She had a few lines in the beginning and a slightly bigger role near the end but that's about it.The writing is just extremely weak compared to the much superior previous two.  For a sequel it really feels like it was created strictly for a profit and no other reason.Now because I admire this particular style of comedy, I confess- I can't bring myself to give it a lower rating than a 4 out of 5.  That's the weak, vulnerable side of me right there, folks- the series has me firmly in its grip so I'd feel guilty ripping the movie to shreds knowing full well that I actually laughed quite a bit.  Still, the first in the series in EASILY superior in every single way.  It's not even debatable!I suppose what confused me a little bit is how the movie got its title.  I assumed it would focus on the children (Ben Stillar's daughter and son) however it just barely touched upon either character at all with the exception of a few segments here and there.  It gives me the feeling the movie wasn't given enough time in the writing department.With that said, one of my favorite moments was the sneaky lizard at the dinner table resulting in a turkey accident, and without a doubt the ball pen ""shark attack"" segment near the end is absolutely hilarious and definitely signs of fantastic writing, so the movie is not a complete loss by ANY means.Of course the communication between Robert De Niro and Ben Stillar is almost as hilarious as it was in the past- there's obviously tension between the two resulting in a quite a few humorous parts.  Again, Robert De Niro doesn't think Ben Stillar's character is acceptable for Robert's daughter.Again though -and sorry for repeatedly pointing this out- the first in this series (Meet the... you know) has MUCH better writing, storytelling and jokes.  If you can overlook the incomplete and rushed writing that takes up most of the film however, it can be pretty funny.  Funny enough to make up for *most* of the obvious disappointment, at least.",4,quality film,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,2930,"['Just', 'give', 'everyone', 'heads', 'up-', ""'m"", 'not', 'allowed', 'say', 'name', 'movie', 'suppose', 'well', 'know', 'second', 'word', 'title', 'almost', 'king', 'bad', 'words', 'result', 'had', 'change', 'wording', 'around', 'Sorry', 'not', 'decision.At', 'first', 'was', 'totally', 'shocked', 'see', 'numerous', 'amount', '1-star', 'reviews', 'film', 'here', 'amazon', 'however', 'watching', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'exactly', 'WHY', 'movie', 'considered', 'such', 'overwhelming', 'disappointment-', 'much', 'worse', 'previous', 'ones', 'series.As', 'far', 'writing', 'what', 'heck', 'really', 'nothing', 'clever', 'jokes', 'dialogue', 'whatsoever.In', 'fact', 'entire', 'script', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'feeling', 'basically', 'watered', 'down', 'version', 'first', 'one', 'series', 'especially', 'everything', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'Speaking', 'Barbara', 'was', 'barely', 'even', 'movie', 'had', 'few', 'lines', 'beginning', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'role', 'end', 'it.The', 'writing', 'just', 'extremely', 'weak', 'compared', 'much', 'superior', 'previous', 'two', 'sequel', 'really', 'was', 'created', 'strictly', 'profit', 'other', 'reason.Now', 'admire', 'particular', 'style', 'comedy', 'confess-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'give', 'lower', 'rating', '4', '5', 'weak', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'right', 'there', 'folks-', 'series', 'firmly', 'grip', ""'d"", 'feel', 'guilty', 'ripping', 'movie', 'shreds', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'actually', 'laughed', 'quite', 'bit', 'Still', 'first', 'series', 'EASILY', 'superior', 'single', 'way', 'not', 'even', 'debatable', 'suppose', 'what', 'confused', 'little', 'bit', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'title', 'assumed', 'would', 'focus', 'children', 'Ben', 'Stillar', 'daughter', 'son', 'however', 'just', 'barely', 'touched', 'character', 'exception', 'few', 'segments', 'here', 'there', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'writing', 'department.With', 'said', 'one', 'favorite', 'moments', 'was', 'sneaky', 'lizard', 'dinner', 'table', 'resulting', 'turkey', 'accident', 'doubt', 'ball', 'pen', 'shark', 'attack', 'segment', 'end', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'definitely', 'signs', 'fantastic', 'writing', 'movie', 'not', 'complete', 'loss', 'ANY', 'means.Of', 'course', 'communication', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Ben', 'Stillar', 'almost', 'as', 'hilarious', 'was', 'past-', 'obviously', 'tension', 'two', 'resulting', 'quite', 'few', 'humorous', 'parts', 'Again', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ben', 'Stillar', 'character', 'acceptable', 'Robert', 'daughter.Again', '-and', 'sorry', 'repeatedly', 'pointing', 'out-', 'first', 'series', 'Meet', 'know', 'MUCH', 'better', 'writing', 'storytelling', 'jokes', 'can', 'overlook', 'incomplete', 'rushed', 'writing', 'up', 'most', 'film', 'however', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Funny', 'enough', 'make', 'up', '*most*', 'obvious', 'disappointment', 'least']",Little Fockers

1159173,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0018AQ2RG,Ed Uyeshima,"[22, 33]","From a storytelling standpoint, this is one lazy film, a dismal studio-manufactured concoction that I hope signals the end of the ""Fockers"" franchise for good (although judging from the ending, it's not very likely). Coming six years after the mega-successfulMeet the Fockers, this apparent 2010 comedy is bereft of any real laughs. Director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) has taken over the reins from Jay Roach, and even with the married-with-children angle, the endless shenanigans pile up in a toothless screenplay by John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey without really adding up to much of anything that hasn't already been done in the previous films. All the stars of the last movie are presented and accounted for although barely in a couple of cases, and a few new ones are added this time around. What prevents me from rating this movie one star is simply that it doesn't offend me more than it acts like a 98-minute sedative.Instead of building the comedy on the angst of meeting someone new as in the first two movies, the plot focuses on Greg and Pam well into their marriage and dealing with the challenges of raising their five-year-old twins, Samantha and Henry - in particular, the need for extra money to finance a major renovation of their dream home and fund the kids' admission to an exclusive private school. At the same time, Jack suffers a heart attack and is focused strictly on his legacy. After being disappointed by another son-in-law who recently split from his daughter, he decides to anoint Greg as the ""Godfocker"" to uphold the sacred honor of the Byrnes family lineage. The two plot threads intertwine when Jack and his all-too-patient wife Dina some to Chicago for their grandchildren's elaborate birthday party. Complicating the mix are an overenthusiastic pharmaceutical sales rep named Andi Garcia, who convinces Greg to endorse an erectile dysfunction drug called Sustengo, and Pam's old boyfriend Kevin, who still naturally carries a torch for her ten years after the first movie (!)The comedy is predictable, most often void of genuine yuks, and punctuated by useless scenes of anal tubing, projectile vomiting, bloodletting during a nasty turkey carving scene, and a traumatizing penile inoculation. Ben Stiller is still Greg, and I give him credit for giving his passive character a bit of a backbone this time in order to generate some minor-league humor. However, Robert De Niro's Jack, the ex-CIA operative, still feels like slumming from a great actor. As the Fockers, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman, who produced the most laughs in the last movie, have about five quick scenes between them, so they really amount to cameo appearances this time. Blythe Danner and Teri Polo are still relegated to the sidelines as Dina and Pam. In his typical hey-dude manner, Owen Wilson returns as the mega-wealthy, emotionally needy Kevin.

The second one was somewhat funny but started the relentless low-brow sexual and potty jokes. Exploitation of a 2 year old involved in scenes depicting ""poop"" and ""boobs"" was embarrasing and that top rated actors participated in this farce was embarrasing for their careers. When we thought we had reached the lowest common denominator we mistakenly watched the third sequel to this tastless series.A child playing a 5 year old got some choice lines in his major motion picture appearance with 4 famous and Academy Award winning actors, a line that should have been cut by any decent writer or director: ""Do girls poop from their vaginas?"" Was that funny? Was it appropriate to give this line to a child actor? Does it contribute to equality among the sexes? Did it add anyting to the story? No to all. Was it abusive exploitation of a child, which should be prosecuted? Yes!If you respect Robert Diniro as an actor or Barbara Streisand as a talented singer and actor, do not watch this show.Besides being crassly, borderline pornographic and abusive of children it just was not funny. It turned out to be a boring rehash of the overt bad taste from the title to the premise of the story. Shame on all these fine actors for stooping into the sewer to retrieve a few more dollars in their otherwise magnificent careers. Three of the actors are well into their 60's and 70's and while they can't stay young forever, seem to have entered a state of dementia in their desperate search for any role in Hollywood.This is a stinker and should be relegated to its rightful place in the septic tank of Hollywood.",1,Toilet Humor,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,1769,"['What', 'started', 'funny', 'movie', 'story', 'Part', 'became', 'terrible', 'trilogy', 'time', 'producers', 'got', 'third', 'iteration', 'collection', 'sex', 'toilet', 'jokes', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'started', 'relentless', 'low-brow', 'sexual', 'potty', 'jokes', 'Exploitation', '2', 'year', 'old', 'involved', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'poop', 'boobs', 'was', 'embarrasing', 'top', 'rated', 'actors', 'participated', 'farce', 'was', 'embarrasing', 'careers', 'When', 'thought', 'had', 'reached', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'mistakenly', 'watched', 'third', 'sequel', 'tastless', 'series.A', 'child', 'playing', '5', 'year', 'old', 'got', 'choice', 'lines', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'appearance', '4', 'famous', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actors', 'line', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'decent', 'writer', 'director', 'Do', 'girls', 'poop', 'vaginas', 'Was', 'funny', 'Was', 'appropriate', 'give', 'line', 'child', 'actor', 'contribute', 'equality', 'sexes', 'Did', 'add', 'anyting', 'story', 'No', 'Was', 'abusive', 'exploitation', 'child', 'should', 'be', 'prosecuted', 'Yes', 'respect', 'Robert', 'Diniro', 'actor', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'talented', 'singer', 'actor', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'show.Besides', 'being', 'crassly', 'borderline', 'pornographic', 'abusive', 'children', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'boring', 'rehash', 'overt', 'bad', 'taste', 'title', 'premise', 'story', 'Shame', 'fine', 'actors', 'stooping', 'sewer', 'retrieve', 'few', 'more', 'dollars', 'otherwise', 'magnificent', 'careers', 'Three', 'actors', 'are', 'well', '60', '70', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'young', 'forever', 'seem', 'have', 'entered', 'state', 'dementia', 'desperate', 'search', 'role', 'Hollywood.This', 'stinker', 'should', 'be', 'relegated', 'rightful', 'place', 'septic', 'tank', 'Hollywood']",Little Fockers

1159185,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0018AQ2RG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[57, 70]","The third film in the Meet the Parents series takes place five years after the last outing and reunites the original cast, while adding some new characters and expanding previously smaller roles. Not only has original director Jay Roach been replaced by Paul Weitz, a sign of trouble to be sure but you know a series is in trouble when it has to introduce children into the mix...Writers tend to introduce children in order to expand their story when that story has run its course. Despite the title, the children don't play too big of a role in the movie and are pawns of the script used to create a reason for these characters to reunite a final time. I enjoyed the first two films in the series and I admit that I went into this thinking it was unnecessary but despite these reservations, I watched the movie with an open mind expecting a mediocre comedy that would entertain me for 90 minutes. While I wouldn't call this movie ""boring,"" I was not prepared for just how mediocre it actually was.Greg (Ben Stiller) and his wife Pam (Teri Polo) are now the parents of five-year-old twins, Henry and Samantha. Greg, in addition to being a male nurse, has taken a job moonlighting for a drug company after meeting the drug representative Andi Garcia (Jessica Alba). The drug is Sustengo, a drug like Viagra that is safe for patients with heart problems. It is pretty obvious where this is going to lead. Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) has recently become interested in tracing the genealogy of the Byrnes family and has still has not completely warmed up to Greg. Jack has developed heart problems and does his best to keep his wife Dina (Blythe Danner) and others in the dark about the severity, while simultaneously growing worried about who he'll appoint to lead the Byrnes family after his demise. Among other things, the movie deals with Greg and Pam planning their twins' upcoming birthday party while attempting to get them into the Early Human School, an expensive, prestigious kindergarten. Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman return as Greg's parents Roz and Bernie but with Roz hosting a TV show and Bernie staying in Spain, it's apparent that the writer's had little use for them. In an expanded role, Owen Wilson returns as Kevin and Laura Dern co-stars as Prudence, the director of the Early Human School. There's also a two-scene cameo by Harvey Keitel, which sounds greater than it is.Only minutes into the movie, it feels like a work of lesser quality than the previous movies. Even worse, the movie is working with established characters that have already been embraced by moviegoers and yet it still insists on dumbing them down. Every character is basically the same and is embodied by the same actor, but character traits have become noticably more cartoonish. These movies have never been built on refined and sophisticated humor, but the humor drops directly into double-digit IQ territory. I'm no snob; I can appreciate and find amusement in double-digit IQ humor but this movie strains so hard for laughs it resorts to bodily functions, including flatulence and projectile vomiting, for laughs. Willing to go anywhere for the sake of comedy, it actually expects us to laugh at the tired gag of someone slicing their finger while serving dinner. It's hardly putting forth more effort when Prudence mistakes Jack and Greg for a couple. Low-brow humor is acceptable, but this type of low-brow humor is on the same wavelength as a movie like Daddy Day Care which it even shares elements of its plot with.The first two films had plots, but this one can't be bothered to provide that kind of coherency. This movie seems like a series of separate gags, re-written as scenes and then strung together in an attempt to create a comedy. The writing by John Hamburg (who actually co-wrote the other two movies surprisingly) and Larry Stuckey is so uninspired and lazy its mediocrity brings down the entire movie. I have put more effort into my writing here than they put into their script. I honestly don't know for sure if this is hyperbole. What I know is not hyperbole is that this has the quality of a straight-to-DVD sequel. It managed to be a financial success, but it effectively puts a nail in the coffin of this series. Even the performances are by-the-numbers, lacking the comedic energy that made the first two movies funny. The actors and the movie fail miserably at re-capturing that old magic and you have to question any film that reunites Keitel and De Niro in the same frame and achieves nothing. Jessica Alba is the only significant new addition to the cast and since she's an actress that's usually heavily criticized, I must mention that she's no worse here than anyone else. I actually think this role would have been a good fit for her if it existed in a better movie.As I mentioned, Kevin is given a larger role although his character adds nothing to the proceedings that another character couldn't have been written to do. It's like Owen Wilson was broke and hanging out on the set due to boredom and was cast and given a paycheck as a favor. Streisand and Hoffman are only incorporated into the movie because they were part of the last one. They serve no purpose here and are extremely underutilized. Hoffman initially declined to reprise his role after finding the script unsatisfactory and was only cast after he reached an agreement with the studio to shoot six scenes. It's no exaggeration that Bernie's role in the movie is literally tacked on. Is there anything good about the movie? Not really, besides the bit of nostalgia from seeing these characters together again even if it's under such unfortunate circumstances. Weitz is a capable director with a good script, so the direction is not as amateurish as the writing but there is really no saving grace here.I expected it to be predictable and formulaic, but it commits the ultimate sin a comedy can commit by being unfunny. I'm not hard to please and can usually find something to enjoy about the most poorly made, poorly written movie. Imagine my surprise that this is so unsuccessful that I literally did not laugh once, a fact that is truly pathetic considering the talent involved. When there is a ""Jaws"" reference in the final minutes of the movie, it becomes apparent just how lame this movie is and serves as further evidence of the weak writing and sheer laziness of the filmmaking. The more I think about it the less it seems like laziness and the more it seems like indifference. Rarely have I seen a movie that makes the truth that it's a cash-in more obvious. Anyone (besides Teri Polo maybe) who claims they were motivated to make this movie by anything other than a paycheck are lying. Mid-way through the film Andi tells Greg, ""Those stories about your family were hilarious."" If only she knew just how much emphasis she should have put on ""were.""GRADE: D-",2,"A Juvenile, Laugh-Free Nail-in-the-Coffin for the Series",1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,6867,"['third', 'film',

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[5, 7]","The third entry in the Meet The Parents series commits numerous crimes, the first of which is not being remotely funny.It's just downright depressing when a third movie in a franchise really does turn out to be this BAD. The filmmakers know this...they know the track record of ""Part III"", so what do they do? Do they go back and figure what made the first film interesting? Or the second an acceptable follow-up? No...they don't have to. They just take every joke, every character dynamic and drive them over a cliff...then over another. We get an enema, projectile vomiting, male ED medication jokes, gas passing, you name it.Jack Byrnes is thinking of his mortality and realizes he must name the next Byrnes Family Patriarch. Who turns out to be his only choice? You guessed it, Greg, his bumbling son-in-law. Even though he's married to Byrnes' daughter...with kids...for years...Byrnes is still insane, paranoid, and skeptical that his son-in-law has what it takes to lead the family in the next generation. What ensues are more supposed ""jokes"", more slapstick humor amped up to embarrassing levels for all involved, and the death knell of the series. All of the principles return, plus Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand in limited roles, plus Owen Wilson as Kevin, the rich ex-beau of Mrs Fokker, who still pines for her and now fancies himself a practitioner of Eastern medicine.The whole affair is meant to be fun but is actually quite depressing. The budget on this movie was $100,000,000(!), most of which presumably went to the high profile actors...respectable actors who are making generational money now by degrading themselves. Not a penny of that money was spent to write a decent joke...or do anything with these characters (anything new, that is). It's still Jack, who is nuts...Greg, who is bumbling and frustrated...yawn, yawn, yawn. The movie made $300,000,000...so it made money, lots of it, and that gives us all the uneasy feeling that a Part 4 could one day appear (no doubt with a ""funnier"" title).Another uncomfortable sight is watching any aging actor fake a heart attack for the cheap ""dramatic"" portions of a bad comedy. Of course, Bobby D does it here, as Jack Byrnes struggles with a heart condition and his limited time left on earth. Do the actors think of their own mortality when they're on the floor, grabbing their chest in mock pain, knowing they can't take the X million they're making on the awfulness with them?Why even write a review? To tell you a) it's even worse than you heard, and b) to try, just try, to discourage anyone of sound mind from actually purchasing this DVD/Blu Ray.

Jack (DeNiro) has a medical condition that he only lets Greg in on because he wants to make sure Greg can handle being next in line to take care of and be the head of the family. In the meantime, a woman from a medical company comes along (Jessica Alba) and wants Greg to promote a new male enhancement product. I don't want to say much more because it will give away too much of the story. But the craziness, chaos and misunderstandings take off from there. Greg tries too hard to impress Jack, while Jack is determined to catch Greg in lies that are all misunderstandings and situations gone horribly wrong.I was really disappointed to see such brief appearances by Streisand and Hoffman (Gregs parents) since they were such a big part of the 2nd movie. They brought so much humor to the 2nd movie because of the characters they played. They were hilarious. None of that was there in this one. I'd like to say maybe my expectations were just too high. Unfortunately a big hit of a movie just missed. They left it open ended for another movie in the installment... maybe it can be redeemed with that one if there is.",2,BIG FAN BUT NOT OF THIS ONE!!,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,1489,"['loved', '1st', '2nd', 'movie', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', '3rd', 'was', ""n't"", ""'bad"", 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'feel', 'made', 'rush', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'apart', 'anything', 'special', 'same', 'ol', 'same', ""ol'.The"", 'premise', 'Greg', 'Stiller', 'Pam', 'now', 'have', 'twins', 'boy', 'girl', 'twins', '5th', 'b-day', 'coming', 'up', 'so', ""'re"", 'getting', 'family', 'together', 'Jack', 'DeNiro', 'medical', 'condition', 'only', 'Greg', 'make', 'sure', 'Greg', 'can', 'handle', 'being', 'next', 'line', 'take', 'care', 'be', 'head', 'family', 'meantime', 'woman', 'medical', 'company', 'along', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Greg', 'promote', 'new', 'male', 'enhancement', 'product', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'will', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'craziness', 'chaos', 'misunderstandings', 'take', 'off', 'there', 'Greg', 'too', 'hard', 'impress', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'determined', 'catch', 'Greg', 'lies', 'are', 'misunderstandings', 'situations', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong.I', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'see', 'such', 'brief', 'appearances', 'Streisand', 'Hoffman', 'Gregs', 'parents', 'were', 'big', 'part', '2nd', 'movie', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'humor', '2nd', 'movie', 'characters', 'played', 'were', 'hilarious', 'None', 'was', 'there', 'one', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'maybe', 'expectations', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'high', 'Unfortunately', 'big', 'hit', 'movie', 'just', 'missed', 'left', 'open', 'ended', 'movie', 'installment', 'maybe', 'can', 'be', 'redeemed', 'one']",Little Fockers

There is absolutely no point to watching this movie, the gags are the same as 10 years ago, and most of the major players simply phone their parts in.

1159215,A35V32HZEGZH04,B0018AQ2RG,"W. Easley ""Opa""","[3, 3]",".Little Folkers is a superb film.  A little critique can reveal its brilliance.First, If you enjoy slapstick, you will adore this film.  You will see creative ""pie in the face"" comedy (in this case using puke), people tripping, people falling into pits, people wrestling and bopping one another.  This is the ""three stooges"" reincarnated.Second, I enjoy the study of child psychology.  In Little Folkers the children rule.  The five year old son intimidates his father with projectile vomiting - on cue.  The five year old daughter rules her father with silence and regularity outsmarts both her father and grandfather.  The grandfather is the biggest child by far.  Jack loves playing spy so he follows people, sets traps for people and tattles on them.  Like many kids he ingests pills from the parents medical supplies and suffers hilarious effects.  Each child is comical, but most important from a psychological point of view - the kids are in charge.Third, I sometimes suffer from insomnia and nothing much helps (warm milk, hot toddy, reading a textbook - all useless to me).  But Little Folkers is a true cure.",5,Salubrious Sociological Snuggery,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,1118,"['.Little', 'Folkers', 'superb', 'film', 'little', 'critique', 'can', 'reveal', 'brilliance.First', 'enjoy', 'slapstick', 'will', 'adore', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'creative', 'pie', 'face', 'comedy', 'case', 'using', 'puke', 'people', 'tripping', 'people', 'falling', 'pits', 'people', 'wrestling', 'bopping', 'one', 'three', 'stooges', 'reincarnated.Second', 'enjoy', 'study', 'child', 'psychology', 'Little', 'Folkers', 'children', 'rule', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'father', 'projectile', 'vomiting', 'cue', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'rules', 'father', 'silence', 'regularity', 'outsmarts', 'father', 'grandfather', 'grandfather', 'biggest', 'child', 'far', 'Jack', 'playing', 'spy', 'so', 'people', 'sets', 'traps', 'people', 'tattles', 'many', 'kids', 'pills', 'parents', 'medical', 'supplies', 'suffers', 'hilarious', 'effects', 'child', 'comical', 'most', 'important', 'psychological', 'point', 'view', 'kids', 'are', 'charge.Third', 'sometimes', 'suffer', 'insomnia', 'nothing', 'much', 'helps', 'warm', 'milk', 'hot', 'toddy', 'reading', 'textbook', 'useless', 'Little', 'Folkers', 'true', 'cure']",Little Fockers
