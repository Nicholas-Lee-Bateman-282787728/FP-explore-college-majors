Jones ""Andy""","[0, 0]","TV feels inundated with sitcoms, but Modern Family manages to rise about most of the crowd with its interesting characters and unique brand of humor.  From the opening episode I was hooked, with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel' but each being equally funny.  The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes, which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme.  It is an interesting format, and the writers have really made it work.Season 1 is well worth checking out if you are looking for a new comedy to follow.

1272191,A1OYG9MEIELQ96,B002JVWQSW,"Anne Parker ""annie reader""","[2, 4]","To call this show quirkey is to underrate it.  It is subtle and brilliant, and draws on satire, microexpressions, assumptions, and deconstructionism to make us laugh at ourselves.It is very well cast.  Sofia Vergara stands out;  she is very beautiful, but that is not why she is so arresting.  As an actress she is present in every moment, responding to each event as though she had never read or rehearsed it.  There is comedy in her surprise and in her reactions to those around her, and we believe her experience.  Ed O Neil's carefully underplayed performance offsets her witty star turn in a way that we can't take our eyes off.  Son Manny is a revelation, Jorges Luis Borges in a child's body, profound, proud, keenly observant of the human experience.The gay couple is very delightful as well as mainstreamed within the internal logic of the show.The suburban couple is fun in the dad-is-dufus-but-mom-loves-him-anyway schtick, but there are some surprising insights in the most predictable roles on the show.  They are both lost, in a way, which means we don't know what will happen, which means I'll keep watching.  And although the entire family of five seems to be continually fumbling for their identity and the proper course of action, we notice that Dylan ""sees"" them.  Dylan sees them and thinks they are all great -- and I looked again and they are.For a few episodes toward the end of the first season I started seeing some predictable silliness of the sitcom in the main suburban family:  ""Oh -- I lied -- now I will get caught -- but last minute something saved the day"" -- that kind of junk.  But when I saw Mitchell chasing the pigeon intruder in slo mo with a soundtrack of Cameron singing Ave Maria in his Irish tenor, I knew I had met pure genius in writing such as I hadn't seen in years.",5,terrific,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,1813,"['call', 'show', 'quirkey', 'underrate', 'subtle', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'microexpressions', 'assumptions', 'deconstructionism', 'make', 'laugh', 'ourselves.It', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'out', 'very', 'beautiful', 'not', 'why', 'so', 'arresting', 'actress', 'present', 'moment', 'responding', 'event', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'rehearsed', 'comedy', 'surprise', 'reactions', 'believe', 'experience', 'Ed', 'O', 'Neil', 'carefully', 'underplayed', 'performance', 'offsets', 'witty', 'star', 'turn', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'Son', 'Manny', 'revelation', 'Jorges', 'Luis', 'Borges', 'child', 'body', 'profound', 'proud', 'keenly', 'observant', 'human', 'experience.The', 'gay', 'couple', 'very', 'delightful', 'as', 'well', 'mainstreamed', 'internal', 'logic', 'show.The', 'suburban', 'couple', 'fun', 'dad-is-dufus-but-mom-loves-him-anyway', 'schtick', 'are', 'surprising', 'insights', 'most', 'predictable', 'roles', 'show', 'are', 'lost', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watching', 'entire', 'family', 'five', 'be', 'continually', 'fumbling', 'identity', 'proper', 'course', 'action', 'notice', 'Dylan', 'sees', 'Dylan', 'are', 'great', 'looked', 'again', 'are.For', 'few', 'episodes', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'started', 'seeing', 'predictable', 'silliness', 'sitcom', 'main', 'suburban', 'family', 'Oh', 'lied', 'now', 'will', 'get', 'caught', 'last', 'minute', 'something', 'saved', 'day', 'kind', 'junk', 'when', 'saw', 'Mitchell', 'chasing', 'pigeon', 'intruder', 'slo', 'mo', 'soundtrack', 'Cameron', 'singing', 'Ave', 'Maria', 'Irish', 'tenor', 'knew', 'had', 'met', 'pure', 'genius', 'writing', 'such', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years']",N/A

1272198,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B002JVWQSW,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[4, 6]","ABC has finally brought a classic comedy to TV. Being a big Married With Children fan back in the day, the main interest I had for this show was the return of the wonderful Ed'o'Neill. Then the reviews started coming in and everyone was stumbling all over themselves on how good a show it was. While Ed was still a big interest, my passion for the show as a whole grew with each rave review that came along. I'm so glad I caught the pilot, because I saw a show that made me laugh out, had great, individual characters, and was also a show filled with real sweetness. I don't know about any of you, but I have already seen a number of moments in this series that mirrored my own. It was almost as if someone in the family was giving stories to the writers. If you know the show, then you know how great it is. If you are a newbie, then let's dig in and get the details....Modern Family centers around three different families. We begin with Jay Pritchett, the family patriarch, and Jay is married to a beautiful(and much younger than he)woman named Gloria, who is Columbian. Gloria has an 11 year old son named Manny(Rico Rodriguez). Then there is Jay's daughter Claire(Julie Bowen), who is married to Phil(Ty Burrell), a doting father who wants to be a ""cool dad"" and ""one of the gang"" to his and Claire's 3 kids, daughters Haley and Alex, and son Luke. Phil works, while Claire runs things at home. And lastly, we have Jay's son Mitchell(Jay Tyler Ferguson), and his boyfriend Cameron(Eric Stonestreet). Mitchell is a lawyer, and Cameron stays home to take care of Lily, the baby they have just adopted. The trials and tribulations of this family and how they sometimes interwove and connect is wonderful. The Pilot episode set it up nicely and made it seem like it was just a documentary on three different families who weren't related, but then brings it all together in the end. Brilliant.""Modern Family"" is a single camera, documentary-style sitcom, like ""The Office"", with cameras following the every day lives and events of these people, and the characters speaking to the camera as if being interviewed. By this time, I had been getting kind of tired of this format, but the show is so great and the docu-style format just works wonderfully for the show. But everything works wonderfully for the show. Created by Steven Levant and Christopher Lloyd, who brought us ""Frasier"" and ""Just Shoot Me"", the show is rich in mining humor from the different types of families on display here. The older guy with the hot wife and young son, the typical family with the 3 kids and white picket fence, and the gay relationship who have just adopted a baby. But nothing would be able to happen if it weren't for the writing and incredible actors to bring it to life. MF is pitch perfect in it's casting. Everyone fits their roles to a T. Every single one of them is interesting, fully developed, and all have their moments to shine. At times, it really feels like you are following real people. Every one here is a stand out, but attention must go to Eric Stonestreet as Cameron, who is a real treasure of a find, and Ty Burrell as Phil. Each character acts and reacts like they are related, and the humor can be absolutely knee slapping hysterical. The writing on the show comes from a lot of real life moments and incidents in the lives of the show's writers and producers, and it feels like this could of really come from someplace. Like I said earlier, I've come across moments from my own life and family.What are some of the episodes you'll get here?. The ""Pilot"", as I've already mentioned, is a great introduction to the series that ties it all together in the end and makes sense. Other notable episodes here include ""The Bicycle Thief"", where Phil tries to teach Luke a lesson and steals his bicycle, only to bring back the wrong bike. ""The Incident"" is a classic that has Shelley Long guest starring as the mother, Jay's ex-wife, who re-appears after making a scene at Jay and Gloria's wedding. Shelley is still a sharp and brilliant comedienne. Want to see Cameron dress up as his favorite clown?. You will in ""Fizbo"". ""Undeck The Halls"" is a hilarious and warm Christmas episode about Phil and Claire threatening to take Christmas away from the kids and then realizing that they have to start being serious about their threats. Benjamin Bratt shows up as Manny's father in ""Up All Night"". Jay and Cameron have an uncomfortable encounter in the gym locker room in ""Moon Landing"". Phil and Claire try some role playing to hilarious results in ""My Funky Valentine"", which also features comedian David Brenner. For those of you into the ipad, you have ""Game Changer"", which isn't a favorite of mine. There, of course, is plenty more.""Modern Family"" gives hope that there can still be good comedy on TV. One of the great things about this show is that even when it isn't a strong episode, it still entertains and has memorable quotes and dialogue. There's something in every episode. For a TV fan like myself who is completely bored with there being so much of the same on the tube, Modern Family came along like a breath of fresh air. It's hysterical, touching, and brilliantly written and acted. Become part of this destined to be classic family now!.",5,It's All Relative,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,5255,"['ABC', 'finally', 'brought', 'classic', 'comedy', 'TV', 'Being', 'big', 'Married',

It is about a patriarch, his second, younger wife, and her child, and his two children and their family. You know, the ""modern family"" with the gay couple and the adopted child from another country, the ""typical"" family with their own quirks, and the second marriage.I am also a fan of NBC's Parenthood, and I honestly find both of them quite refreshing.  I couldn't begin to compare the two, as Parenthood is more of a drama, and I had reservations after enjoying Parenthood so much, but I am so glad I decided to watch this show and found it extremely enjoyable.  Even though Modern Family doesn't take itself too seriously, real family situations are used and the situations are relatable on some level, which in ways makes it funnier.It is a fantastic show with fabulous writing and wonderful acting.  I used it as a pick me up after going through some personal stuff and it worked! I am not one to giggle a lot or laugh out loud a lot, but it made me giggle.

When I took the time to actually pay attention to every line, I found it quite funny. Now that I have come to know the characters, it gets funnier (although I can sometimes guess exactly what will be coming next.)Funniest?  Best?  Probably not, but still up there close to the top.The only slight negatives:  After EVERY episode, I had to get through the screen that says, ""The views expressed in the interviews and commentary...""  You know the one.  And then comes the warning about copyrighted material. Come on! We all know about all of that. If you need to put it in for legal reasons, ONCE is enough! Most DVDs put it at the beginning, and in some you can skip past it once you see it. Here you are bombarded after every episode. NOT necessary! (BTW, there were no commentaries anyway.)Also I could not understand why Episode 6 was changed to Episode 2 on Disc 1.  I am a stickler for watching episodes in the order that they aired, but this was a bit of a mystery to me.  The only assumption I can make is that the episodes were on the DVD in the order they were filmed, although this is usually not the case for TV DVDs if that order is different from airing order.

There is the patriarch, Jay (played by the wonderful Ed O'Neill) who has remarried a much younger Columbian wife with her young Columbian son, Manny.  Jay and Manny are pretty funny together.  Jay has a grown daughter and a grown son with their extended families.  Hands down the funniest bunch for me is the son who is gay, his partner and their newly adopted Vietnamese daughter Lily.  Everything this gay couple does is hilarious.  I watched the whole series again and this time I found that the son-in-law real estate agent, Phil, grew on me too.  He is a very odd guy, weirder in his own way than the gay guys.  He takes some getting used to as a character but I am enjoying him a lot now.

I had previously watched the seasons on loan from my local library but for this price I couldn't say no.Season one is decidedly better than season two, though both are brilliant.  This series is brought to you from the same folks that were responsible for the Emmy hungry series Frasier.  The same brilliance in characterization, writing, and acting is present here as well.  I would expect nothing less from Levitan and Lloyd (not the Christopher Lloyd from Back to the Future!).If you haven't seen this series, then I will touch briefly on the premise. Especially since they don't really tell you on the show... but on the extras and the website they explain it.Apparently a Scandinavian film crew wants to document an average, extended American family for either a series or a documentary to be shown in their home country.  We never see the crew, and it has a feel similar to 'The Office' where the characters often deliver monologues to the camera or have funny little looks at the camera during scenes.There are three households.  The patriarch is Jay Pritchett.  He divorced and was married to a much younger and very attractive Colombian woman named Gloria.  She brings her son from her previous marriage, Manny.  Jay's son, Mitchell, is gay and lives with his partner Cam and their adopted daughter Lily.  Jay's daughter, Claire, is married to Phil Dunphy and they have two girls and one boy.  So we see one somewhat conventional appearing household(that might be the most dysfunctional!) and two unconventional households.  Cue hilarity.A lot of the humor is based on awkward moments, and we see each of the household's struggle with their own share of problems.  What ties everything together is their affection for each other.  Not obvious up front, but we see through their interactions that despite sometimes being short with one another they really are a caring bunch.The first season has some great moments, real laugh out loud moments.  I have struggled with new sitcoms but this is a truly funny show.  If you don't laugh out loud with Dylan starts playing his song for Haley in front of the family, then I'm wrong.The acting is top notch, especially Ty Burrell (Phil Dunphy) and Eric Stonestreet (Cam).  I think they both won Emmy's, deservingly so.  And I like that like Friends, none of the cast would submit their Emmy nominations for Best Lead Actor or Actress, only supporting.A funny, often heartwarming show about an unconventional family that somehow makes it work.

It's also the type of show where you really can't just jump in on any episode; you have to learn about the characters for things to be funny/ironic.I would say that Cameron and Mitchell are the most hilarious couple, with Cam being very overdramatic while Cam is more shy and reserved.  The two adopt a daughter in the first episode and their lives really revolve around her (and their drama).  I remind myself a lot of Cam, so I'm biased.The Dunphy's are my second favorite.  At first I hated Phil, but now he's one of my favorites.  He can act like a totally idiot and is the &#34;wannabe&#34; cool dad, but it works because the combination of that with his strong work ethic and helping around the house make him a great family member.  Although it's interesting that the show is called 'MODERN Family' considering that none of the women have jobs, they have broken some new ground by having husband and wife sharing chores.  Phil and Claire will go grocery shopping together and make dinner together; it's not just her taking care of the bumbling husband.Jay, Gloria, and Manny Pritchett are probably my least favorite.  Manny is really funny and Ed O'Neill as Jay really gives some classic Al Bundy looks, but Gloria is just irritating sometimes that I can't stand her.  The other storylines are just funnier, anyway.Some people didn't think it was possible to make another &#34;classic family sitcom&#34; in this day and age because of how much technology is used.  Instead of pretending like it doesn't exist, the show successfully integrates technology into the show and just makes it a part of their everyday lives.Definitely a groundbreaking show in its own right, although the recent episodes (season 4) have been rather disappointing.",5,Starts Out Strong,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,1909,"[""'Modern"", 'Family', ""n't"", 'best', 'comedy', 'ever', 'be', 'television', 'surely', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'overrated', 'times', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'really', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'also', 'type', 'show', 'where', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'jump', 'episode', 'have', 'learn', 'characters', 'things', 'be', 'funny/ironic.I', 'would', 'say', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'are', 'most', 'hilarious', 'couple', 'Cam', 'being', 'very', 'overdramatic', 'Cam', 'more', 'shy', 'reserved', 'two', 'adopt', 'daughter', 'first', 'episode', 'lives', 'really', 'revolve', 'drama', 'remind', 'lot', 'Cam', ""'m"", 'biased.The', 'Dunphy', 'are', 'second', 'favorite', 'first', 'hated', 'Phil', 'now', 'one', 'favorites', 'can', 'act', 'totally', 'idiot', '34', 'wannabe', '34', 'cool', 'dad', 'combination', 'strong', 'work', 'ethic', 'helping', 'house', 'make', 'great', 'family', 'member', 'interesting', 'show', 'called', 'Family', 'considering', 'none', 'women', 'have', 'jobs', 'have', 'broken', 'new', 'ground', 'having', 'husband', 'wife', 'sharing', 'chores', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'will', 'go', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'together', 'make', 'dinner', 'together', 'not', 'just', 'taking', 'care', 'bumbling', 'husband.Jay', 'Gloria', 'Manny', 'Pritchett', 'are', 'probably', 'least', 'favorite', 'Manny', 'really', 'funny', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Jay', 'really', 'classic', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'Gloria', 'just', 'irritating', 'sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other', 'storylines', 'are', 'just', 'funnier', 'anyway.Some', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'possible', 'make', '34', 'classic', 'family', 'sitcom', '34', 'day', 'age', 'how', 'much', 'technology', 'used', 'Instead', 'pretending', ""n't"", 'exist', 'show', 'successfully', 'technology', 'show', 'just', 'part', 'everyday', 'lives.Definitely', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'own', 'right', 'recent', 'episodes', 'season', '4', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'disappointing']",N/A

1272225,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002JVWQSW,Ed Uyeshima,"[12, 15]","First things first, I think this is the funniest sitcom sinceArrested Development, but it also dares to be heartwarming by the end of each episode. Thanks to the laser-piercing sharpness of the writing, it continually gets away with such a potentially fatal combination and has become that all-too-rare show that I schedule my otherwise hectic life around - even if the individual episodes are available on the ABC Web site hours after they air. Created by Christopher Lloyd (Frasier) and Steven Levitan (The Larry Sanders Show), the show offered two-dozen episodes during its premiere season, all of which are included along with several worthy extras in this four-disc set.The premise is simple and the format quite familiar. It centers on the families of Jay Pritchett, his daughter Claire, and his son Mitchell, all of whom live close to each other in Los Angeles. The format is a sitcom under the guise of a mockumentary (much like Christopher Guest's best films,Waiting for GuffmanandBest in Show), which allows all the characters to express their honest opinions about each other, primarily exposing their personal idiosyncrasies and irritants. It's a tried-and-true approach, and in the expert hands of the writers involved, it works beautifully. Jay is the aging patriarch happily married to a much-younger Columbian spitfire of a wife, Gloria. He struggles to keep up with her energy and high-voltage temperament, while helping to raise her cherubic, pre-adolescent son, Manny, acting well beyond his tender years.Meanwhile, Jay's high-strung daughter Claire is married with three kids of her own. Her realtor husband Phil is your typical one-step-behind dad who thinks he is much cooler than he is, while Claire's control-freak tendencies are a reflex to not only his affable, conflict-avoiding nature but to her hopeless inability to push her children (especially eldest daughter Haley) away from the apparent hellion she was as a teenager. But I have to admit my favorite dynamic on the show is between Jay's lawyer son Mitchell and his flamboyant life partner Cameron, a former music teacher. Instead of focusing entirely on their same-sex relationship, the creators wisely chose to focus on them as new, overcompensating parents to their adopted Vietnamese baby, Lily. It's really easy to endear yourself to this extended family who manage to generate genuine likability through their somewhat dysfunctional nature.The fact that Claire and Phil represent the only traditional family structure of the three makes an emotionally resonant comment on the acceptance of diversity in contemporary relationships that cross cultures, generations, same-sex barriers and overseas adoptions. What's more, the point is not hammered in any moralistic manner but through shrewd characterizations, relatable personal crises, and genuinely funny, laugh-out-loud outcomes. The show is also blessed with an excellent regular cast that starts with Ed O'Neill who manages to bring curmudgeonly warmth to his Al Bundy-like bluster as Jay. At first, Sofia Vergara's Gloria bordered a bit too much on stereotype, but as her own foibles were exposed, e.g., her self-denial over her bad driving and her hypersensitivity to any misconstrued comment about her heritage, she became far more relatable. Julie Bowen could have been the show's inevitable wet-rag, but she makes Claire's often unpopular stances as the sensible mom hilarious case studies in the slow burn, the dead-eyed stare and the double-take.As Mitchell, Jesse Tyler Ferguson superbly contrasts Mitchell's elitist attitude and discomfort with public displays of affection with a deeper need to squash his ""mama's boy"" reputation. Even with such keen competition, there are two standouts in this crack ensemble. In Steve Carell-like fashion, Ty Burrell makes Phil a hilarious doofus of a dad in classic TV style, while Eric Stonestreet's Cameron is one of comedy's ingeniously lovable creations, an emotionally naked, over-the-top character who stays true to his corn-belt sensibilities. All the kid actors are great without being grating, and guest stars have turned in some stellar work. Most notable have been Shelley Long as Jay's new-age ex-wife unforgivable for ""The Incident""; Fred Wiilard as Phil's evasive, joke-alike dad in ""Travels with Scout""; and Elizabeth Banks as Cameron and Mitchell's perpetually drunk gal-pal Sal in ""Great Expectations"".Funny deleted and extended scenes and family interviews are included with most of the episodes on all four discs, but the fourth disc has the lion's share of extras including a gag reel. Also included is a ten-minute featurette, ""Real Modern Family Moments"", which amusingly shows that a lot of the situations depicted on the show are based on what really happened in the lives of the production team. There is also the looking-back ""Before Modern Family"", which showcases the principal actors before their casting on the show, and separately, there is a piece on Stonestreet's previous incarnation as ""Fizbo the Clown"". There is not one but two behind-the-scenes featurettes, ""Making Modern Family: Family Portrait"", which looks at the making of the first season finale, and ""Modern Family Hawaii"", which looks at the Hawaiian vacation episode. It's all well worth the purchase.",5,An Unexaggerated Must-Get: Season One of Network TV's Best Sitcom,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,5288,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'think', 'funniest', 'sitcom',

It tells the story of three very different modern families all related going about their day-to-day lives and challenges.The first family is Jay Pritchett played by Ed O'Neill & Gloria Delgado-Pritchett played by Sof&iacute;a Vergara and her son, Manny Delgado played by Rico Rodriguez. Jay owns his own business and is an older, successful man who got divorced (with good reason since in an early episode, you get to see how crazy she was) and miraculously bagged Gloria, a vivacious, beautiful divorcee from Columbia. Jay is stubborn and stuck in his ways and Gloria is a free spirit always expressing emotion and encouraging her son basically to sprout wings and fly his own course by his heart. Sof&iacute;a Vergara is a newer actress but manages to create a character so lovable with many authentic qualities that keep her from being a stereotype. Manny is one of the most mature 10 year olds you will ever meet and is very proud of his heritage and wears his heart on his sleeve trying to write poetry for girls which Jay tries to discourage. Rico Rodriguez is a scene stealer and the most fun to watch of all the kids on the show.The second family is the most nuclear of the show with Jay's daughter, Claire Dunphy played by Julie Bowen and her husband, Phil played by Ty Burrell. Claire is a stay-at-home mom who at first comes off as the most normal character in the entire show, but eventually her obsessive-compulsive perfectionism and a few other well-placed come into play explaining why she's in this family to begin with. Ty Burrell walks the line with this character that is such a fool believing he's a cool dad, husband, realtor, anything he attempts with enough realism that you feel like you've met this person in your life. The kids here are type characters, but still very funny. First there's the pretty one with the older boyfriend in a band, Haley played by Sarah Hyland. Then there's the smart one that likes to instigate situations, Alex played by Ariel Winter. Finally there's the dim-witted youngest child that can't keep his pants on and runs into doors, Luke played by Nolan Gould.The third family is made up of Claire's brother, Mitchell Pritchett played by Jesse Tyler Ferguson and his partner, Cameron Tucker played by Eric Stonestreet who have just adopted a little Vietnamese baby girl, Lilly (played by twins Ella and Jaden Hiller). Mitchell is a lawyer who is overprotective, always worried about the baby's progress and has a quick temper letting every little comment get to him escalating into big fights with his family. Cameron is the more flamboyant of the two and is a nurturer, loves to dress up as a clown, dance, sing, and is a stay-at-home dad.All of the couples have great on screen chemistry together, particularly in the interview segments. It's amazing that we as a culture are totally used to this format of television show now where not only are characters acting out stories, but they occasionally come and break the fourth wall talking to a camera as if answering questions and giving life advice. It's almost like Shakespearean ""asides"" in a way if you think about it to get into the mind of the character more than ever before. Do we know why anyone is interviewing them? No, and we no longer care to ask.The writing on this show is fantastic and after watching some of the bonus features, it seems some of the situations were taken from real-life situations prover life can be stranger than fiction once again. The plots are hilarious and these characters breathe so much energy into them, I almost dare you not to crack up at them. My favorite characters are Phil and Gloria because he is such an idiot that doesn't know it, I'd almost compare him to Michael Scott from ""The Office"" and she is such a passionate woman who doesn't let anyone walk all over her and expresses herself so well. In the pilot episode, you might mistakenly look at her as a gold-digging trophy wife without a brain cell in her body, but she swears the pants in that family more than Jay will ever figure out.Let's let the awards do the talking for a moment. It has been nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Television Series Musical or Comedy. It also won 6 Emmys (Casting, Comedy Series, Editing, Sound Mixing, Supporting Actor Eric Stonestreet, Writing) and was nominated for another 8 (Art Direction, Directing, Guest Star Fred Willard, Editing, Supporting Actor Ty Burrell, Supporting Actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Supporting Actor Julie Bowen, Supporting Actor Sof&iacute;a Vergara). That is amazing! I don't remember EVER seeing so many actors nominated from a single series in its first year so one win out of five nominations ain't bad considering how impressive it is for so many from one show to be picked in the first place. I highly recommend checking this show out, it is very funny and family-oriented.Bonus Features:""Before Modern Family"" tells the tale of what projects (if any) the actors worked on before coming to the show and how they found out about it and shows some clips of their screen tests. ""Real Modern Family Moments"" is a fun little featurette where the writers sit down and confess the truthiness (yes, I'm using that word) of some of the stories written into the show like dressing up for the firemen, the pigeon getting stuck in the house, and finding weird things under the house after a repairman came to visit to name a few.The deleted interview segments and extended/alternate scenes make you wish the show could be shown commercial-free to include them all since they are all pretty funny material. Modern Family ""Hawaii"" and ""Family Portrait"" go behind the scenes of those episodes talking about how fun it was to travel to Hawaii for work and getting the light correct as well as the final episode of the season. The gag reel is a gag reel and ""Fizbo the Clown"" tells the story of Eric Stonestreet's upbringing and great love for clowns and dressing up as them being a genuine fact.",5,Modern Family could be

Claire is a homemaker mom in a traditional family, married to Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell); they have three children. Jay is married to a much younger woman, Gloria (Sof&iacute;a Vergara), and is raising a pre-teen stepson. Mitchell and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) are a gay couple who have adopted a Vietnamese baby, Lily. The families meet for family functions, around the neighborhood, and cross-family bonding.I caught this show on the off-chance (luckily it was the pilot too) and was instantly hooked - it is hilarious! As well as being side-splittingly funny, the show is also very realistic with everyday scenarios that could (and do) happen to anyone and everyone. The chemistry and interaction between the actors' characters is spot-on and feels very genuine, so I truly admire how well each and every one of the cast perform in this fantastic new show. Each episode also revolves around a theme - whether it be fear, lying, Christmas etc, so never gets boring or short of variety. Thankfully it has been renewed for at least a second season so there's plenty more to come and I sincerely look forward to seeing where this show goes in the future.

1272242,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B002JVWQSW,Jack E. Levic,"[1, 1]","Watch just one episode of MODERN FAMILY and you will be hooked on the outrageously funny adventures of the Pritchett family. Here is a show with charm and humor. No show since SEINFELD has made me laugh so hard and so joyously.Ed O'Neill is back on TV as Jay Pritchett, the patriarch of this unusual clan. Sixty-something Jay is married to a much younger and totally gorgeous and saucy Colombian woman named Gloria. Along with Gloria comes her son Manny from a previous marriage. Manny is one of the many stand-outs in this show. Overweight and often awkward, Manny is amazingly self-confident thanks to his ""don't mess with my son"" mother.Jay's son Mitchell and his partner Cam have adopted a Vietnamese baby to complete their family. Mitchell and especially Cam can be over the top in campy gay stereotypic fashion. Don't miss the episode of a terrified Mitchell trying rid the house of a pigeon that has accidentally and harmlessly flown into their house.Mitchell's sister Claire is equally as high strung and leaning to drama as he is. She's married to the goofy but loveable Phil. Their three children round out the show as three very different characters.The writing is so crisp and so funny in MODERN FAMILY. The one-liners are hilarious and the show crosses the bounds of political correctness in a way that we know not to take certain comments too seriously. Gloria is a fiery latina with a fiery temper along with a passionate zest for life. It's easy to believe that she actually loves Jay and they do have a happy marriage. Her Spanish accent is forced to almost the point of ridiculousness. Think of Charo for those of a certain age. I don't know if Sofia Vergara has an accent in real life but definitely she's playing up Gloria's way of speaking. Sofia Vergara must be one of the most beautiful woman around and she sure is a treat to watch.There is an extra treat in MODERN FAMILY. Don't miss Minnie Driver, Shelly Long, Benjamin Bratt, Elizabeth Banks and Edward Norton in various guest roles. One thing that makes this show so special is that despite all their disagreements and annoyances with each other, in the end this family loves and respects each other.

1272244,A3A9UCRADPMCT8,B002JVWQSW,James Horlan,"[0, 0]","I'm a late convert to the cult of Modern Family, but a grateful one, as this is the funniest show I've ever seen.  I bought this set on the advice of a co-worker who would not stop talking about the show, and man was he right about it.For those even newer to the cult than I am, Modern Family is about an extended family of 11 people:  Jay (Ed O'Neill), the patriarch, and his new-ish wife Gloria (Sofia Vergara) and her 11 year old son Manny (Rico Rodriguez);  Jay's son Mitchell (Jesse Ferguson), his boyfriend Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), and their new adopted baby Lily (various);  Jay's daughter Claire (Julie Bowen), her husband Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell), and their kids Hailey (Sarah Hyland), who's 15 I think, 14 year old Alex (Ariel Winter), and 10 year old Luke (Nolan Gould).  One thing that the creators did very well was that they made none of the relationships new.  Jay and Gloria had been married for six months at the start of the show, though one episode did flashback to their wedding reception, and Mitchell and Cameron were five years into their relationship, though Lily was brand new.  Phil and Claire were at the 16 year mark, with all the good and bad of that.  The characters are all well off, in a manner, with Jay being pretty affluent, with Mitchell a lawyer and Phil a real estate agent that the crash didn't seem to impact much.  This works well for the show, surprisingly enough, as the comedy centers more on interactions between the characters and outsiders, rather than money issues and what to do.The strength of the show is of course the ensemble, and it's remarkable how well all of the actors play off each other, no matter what the combination.  You can stick any of the kids with any of the adults and something or someone will come out shining.  In particular Manny is hilarious, he's 11 going on 50, much to the amusement/horror of Jay, without being too 'cute'.  All of the kids are excellent, which is not surprising if you look at their CV's, veterans all, this isn't the first, or tenth, rodeo for any of them.  The adults are all interesting too, and are helped by the fact that there are so many of them.  Phil, played by Emmy nominee Ty Burrell (for both seasons), is the self professed 'cool dad', and at first a little of Phil goes a long way.  But his character develops over the season, and has some poignant moments at times.  Cameron, with Eric Stonestreet's Emmy winning performance, is a bit over the top (Stonestreet is straight in real life), but not glaringly so, and contrasts nicely with Ferguson's button-downed Mitchell.  They're a believable couple, and everyone accepts them, even Jay.  Jay would probably prefer that his son not be gay, but Cameron is included in every family activity, and he and Jay bond over sports and bicker like friends.  Which they are, and it's pretty refreshing.  Ed O'Neill certainly isn't playing a rich Al Bundy (though there are ghostly hints here and there), while Sofia Vergara's Gloria is on some levels the sexy second wife, but she's not superficial in the least and geniunely seems to love Jay.  Julie Bowen plays Claire as an uptight, high strung stay at home mom of three, and watching her get tighter and tighter as the season progressed was interesting.  All of the adult characters have arcs, and evolve.  And none take over, there's no Sheldon Cooper type thing going on here, though he's brilliant.

1272253,AD9WTAOAFUZA4,B002JVWQSW,"Jose R. Perez ""Jose""","[0, 0]","""Modern Family"" is all it's been cracked up to be ... and more.  Each week, the three families in this docu-comedy deliver some of the most inspired moments in comedy television since other classics like ""Soap"", ""Bernie Mac"" or ""The Simpsons.""  Irreverent, intelligent and often side-splitting, the ensemble cast is brilliant, from the startling hysterical kids to the never-better Ed O'Neill.The amazing Ty Burrell is unforgettable as Phil Dunphy (check him out hosting the annual Real Estate Awards Ceremony for sheer genius).  Jessie Tyler Ferguson as Mitchell - half the gay couple - continues to grow on me week after week (his frightful head trip with a pigeon had me in stitches), as he confronts the utterly inane and made-in-comedy-heaven antics of his partner Cam.  Sofia Vergara is drop-dead stunning as Gloria, a no-nonsense Latina traditionalist in a bombshell body, voluptuous yet vulnerable, sensitive and totally unaware of her beauty and sex appeal.  The broad caricature required of her character is offset with a delicious delivery that's less stereotype and more human.  And her mispronunciations are heaven-sent comedy one-liners that inevitably make me dissolve into a fit of hysterical giggles.  When someone ""scares the bejessus out of her"", it's the Baby Jesus they're messing with!  And as a witch on Halloween, Vergara shines in what may be an Emmy performance!Eric Stonestreet's Cam was the breakout star of the 1st season winning an Emmy as Best Supporting Actor right out of the gate.  And while everyone in this delightful cast deserves to be lauded - and all of them will eventually I suspect - Stonestreet matches Vergara in nailing his lines with the lived-in comfort of an overweight insecure and nelly middle aged man.  He's a bundle of nervous energy - part Mork (the eternally great Robin Williams), part Jodie (Billy Crystal's ground-breaking character in ""Soap""), yet ALL Cameron!  Stonestreet puts the force in ""tour-de-force"" with a grab-you-by-the-nuts conviction and utterly bizarre loopiness that's endearing and HYSTERICAL.Burrell, Vergara, Ferguson, and O'Neill have moments of pure comedy perfection in the ensemble.  But the rest of the cast is uniformly top-notch.Julie Bowen as Clare - Phil's wife - is sharp as a tack, all drive and energy and focus, despite the inevitable stupidity that she deals with in the warped and utterly relatable family she's surrounded by.  The voice of reason for the Dunpheys, she's daddy's little girl, Phil's muse and comic joy-buster, Mitchell's rival and Cam's conscience.  She's also a mom juggling a crass and uncensored son, Luke (a truly 3-D boy-joy of a kid - a first in television in my opinion) and two teenage daughters - polar opposites with age-appropriate self-esteem issues that go hand in hand with growing up.  All are fantastic.  And, finally, there's Rico Rodriguez as Manny, Gloria's older-and-wiser-than-he has a right to be son...is the perfect tonic to O'Neill's gin, infused with both his mom's gumption and guts and the wisdom he inherits from the adults that inhabit his cul-de-sac.  He's a rich character who may be worthy of a spin-off as a genius 15 year old in college.  Rodriguez - like the rest of this inspired cast nails his lines like nobody's business.  Kudos to the writers and casting team, those unsung geniuses to whom we owe this weekly vacation-of-the-giggles!Together, these families reflect our schools, homes, little league games and neighborhoods.  ""Modern Family"" is a brave, passionate and heartfelt portrait of family life so rarely seen on screen today.  It's also familiar, and relatable in a way that actually makes you think (for a change, especially when it comes to family ""sitcoms"").  And if you don't think it can get any better, it happens to be a miraculous joyous and hopeful comedy filled with foibles and funny moments galore, vivid characters in familiar situations and belly-clenching guffaws that often require a second viewing!This is comedy at its best - and the reason some of us still watch Network TV.

Nolan Gould (Luke) does a terrific job as the youngest child in the zoo.My best review is reserved for Rico Rodriguez (Manny). He is outstanding. In fact, I would say award worthy.

I was a big Married with Children fan and love Ed O'Neill so I was excited to watch. Sofia is so smoking hot, she could turn woman gay and Manny is like a little old soul.Claire(Julie Bowen) is Jay's daughter and she is married to Phil(Ty Burrell). They have 3 children and the dynamics of this household cracks me up. Phil really thinks he is intuned with everyone, cool dad, understanding husband but he is adorably clueless.The next household is Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), Jay's son who lives with his partner Cameron(Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted Vietnamese baby, Lily. This couple is too funny.Why This Show Works: The writers are witty. The actors deliver perfectly and there is nothing like this on TV. I love how the actors turn to the camera and give face!

There are very few comedies worth watching on TV today, but this show delivers every single week. The whole cast is outstanding and there is real chemistry between everyone, but I think three actors really stand out. Ed O'Neill sheds his Al Bundy persona and turns in a very comfortable, laid back performance that does wonders. Most of the big laughs come from Ty Burrell, who finally found a role that lets his dorky humor shine through, and Eric Stonestreet who plays the most over-the-top character other than Gloria, but never falls into that too far it doesn't seem real anymore category. Julie Bowen, Sofia Vergara, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Rico Rodriguez, who acts like a grown man trapped in a child's body, all fill in the cracks and often deliver very memorable moments themselves.I'm happy to report that there is no sophomore slump with Modern Family.

They are one of the funniest ensembles on television right now.Before the show premiered, I had set my mind on watching it solely because of the participation of Ed O'Neill, whom I'm a fan of from his iconic, outrageously over-the-top turn as Al Bundy on the 1987-1997 smash hit FOX sitcom Married with Children. I wasn't expecting much, though, because O'Neill hadn't made much of an impression since the monster success of Married with Children. Sure enough, when Modern Family started, I wasn't keen on O'Neill's new role. Not because he wasn't funny, but because, compared to the live-action cartoonish buffoonery of Al Bundy, O'Neill's quieter, subtle humor on Modern Family was more like Agnes of God.From the get-go, however, the situations and characters have been hilarious, and O'Neill has grown nicely into his role as the grandfather patriarch of his extended family.So kudos to Stonestreet, O'Neill, and the cast and crew of Modern Family for producing an Emmy-winning comedy that is actually worthy of our time, our involvement, and most importantly, our laughter.",5,The RajMan (Fan) Review,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,1508,"['Congratulations', 'Eric', 'Stonestreet', 'Modern', 'Family', 'Their', 'Emmy', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'Eric', 'Stonestreet', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Outstanding', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'role', 'ABC', 'Modern', 'Family', 'also', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'Outstanding', 'Writing', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'Outstanding', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'am', 'equally', 'very', 'happy', 'about.Everyone', 'show', 'Emmy', 'are', 'fantastic', 'are', 'one', 'funniest', 'ensembles', 'television', 'right', 'show', 'premiered', 'had', 'set', 'mind', 'watching', 'solely', 'participation', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'whom', ""'m"", 'fan', 'iconic', 'outrageously', 'over-the-top', 'turn', 'Al', 'Bundy', '1987-1997', 'smash', 'hit', 'FOX', 'sitcom', 'Married', 'Children', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'though', ""O'Neill"", 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'much', 'impression', 'monster', 'success', 'Married', 'Children', 'Sure', 'enough', 'when', 'Modern', 'Family', 'started', 'was', ""n't"", 'keen', ""O'Neill"", 'new', 'role', 'Not', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'because', 'compared', 'live-action', 'cartoonish', 'buffoonery', 'Al', 'Bundy', ""O'Neill"", 'quieter', 'subtle', 'humor', 'Modern', 'Family', 'was', 'more', 'Agnes', 'God.From', 'get-go', 'however', 'situations', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', ""O'Neill"", 'grown', 'nicely', 'role', 'grandfather', 'patriarch', 'extended', 'family.So', 'kudos', 'Stonestreet', ""O'Neill"", 'cast', 'crew', 'Modern', 'Family', 'producing', 'Emmy-winning', 'comedy', 'actually', 'worthy', 'time', 'involvement', 'most', 'importantly', 'laughter']",N/A

1272305,A3I8FT707XKQAJ,B002JVWQSW,Sam Quixote,"[0, 0]","""Modern Family"" follows Phil and Claire and their three kids, Haley, Alex and Luke; Mitchell, Cameron and Lily, a gay couple who've adopted a Vietnamese baby; Jay (father of Claire and Mitchell) who's married a Colombian woman Gloria and Gloria's son Manny - all part of the same family and all agreeing to be filmed as part of a reality show to showcase what family life is like in the 21st century.This is definitely one of the funniest family comedies out there at the moment, having some superbly written episodes and clever setups. Favourite episodes: Luke's birthday party where Phil reveals his phobia of clowns only for Cameron to show up dressed as a clown for Luke's present; The Valentine's Day episode where Claire surprises Phil with the bassist of Spandau Ballet to play them songs because she thinks Phil loves Spandau Ballet but he doesn't know any of their songs. The bassist is played superbly by Ed Norton whose English accent has to be heard to be believed. Elizabeth Banks is also in the episode as the party girl friend of Mitchell and Cameron's who resents that they have a child now; the Anniversary episode where Claire and Phil role play at a hotel and Claire gets her coat stuck on the escalator. She can't take it off as she's wearing nothing underneath; the Hawaii holiday two parter.There are some things that niggle:The whole ""filming a reality show"" angle - there are some scenes that make you wonder how anyone could believe that. Like in one scene the camera crew is in Haley's room while she's sleeping, her boyfriend's on the floor, and Claire bursts in telling her to get up - but doesn't mention the camera crew in her sleeping daughter's room? Also when the family leave for Hawaii and Phil sets the alarm the camera crew is clearly still in the house - so he's just locked the camera crew in the house with the alarm on? Conveniently getting footage of Dylan locked in the house as well.Also it sometimes has that moralising thing at the end of the episode where it gets all gooey and has that after-school special kind of vibe, ""Today I learned that..."". ""Scrubs"" did this kind of thing to death and rendered most of those episodes unwatchable for repeat viewings but thankfully ""Modern Family"" doesn't have this all of the time.That said, those are small things that are vastly overshadowed by the quality of the writing and the brilliant comedic sensibilities of the actors. There isn't a poor performance in the bunch which is rare considering the cast includes 3 child actors while Ty Burrell who plays Phil is outstanding and never once fails to light up a scene when he's in it and it's great to see Ed O'Neill back doing great comedy on TV again. Julie Bowen is an actress I've never seen before but was very impressed with her work here as Claire and Eric Stonestreet who plays Cameron definitely has plenty of excellent moments in this series.There's too much to mention in one review so I'll leave it at this: ""Modern Family"" is a fantastic sit com that's full of funny jokes, great storylines, and wonderful performances. There's so much to love that even at 24 episodes you'll devour them all in a couple of days.

This follows three families in a mockumentary style as they go about the events in their life. There is Jay and his second wife, hot Columbian Gloria, as well as her son Manny who is old before his time. Then there is the gay couple, Mitch (son of Jay) and Cameron with their adopted Vietnamese baby, Lily. Lastly there is the hilarious Phil, his wife Claire (daughter of Jay) and their kids Hailey (pretty, but not too bright), Alex (the geeky one) and Luke (also not too bright and prone to accidents).Some characters come out with lines that leave me howling and holding my sides and Phil and Cameron are both wonderful to watch. The actors who play these roles manage to bring the jokes alive with their facial expressions and delivery. The `interviews' for the documentary also throw up some delightful moments where people say what they really feel/think, which are then shown against what actually happened.There is such an eclectic mix of characters and family styles here that this is able to draw on many family incidents to create the show, although all the families are very middle class and comfortable.My description doesn't do this show full justice, but suffice it to say this is hilarious and highly recommend and when America does a show right, it does it VERY right. They may be few and far between, but when they do come along they more than make up for it.

One is gay, the second is interracial, and the last is straight and white. Consequently, they're all pathetic and cliched, especially the gay one, it seems like they're just there for the sake of being politically correct. How is this funny? Furthermore, in retrospect it actually seems like they're all just clustered together to make the show look more progressive and diverse than other shows but realistically what normal family in this era do you know that has all the aforementioned groups living in an upper-middle class community?Of course like almost every comedy in the last 10 years the male lead characters are portrayed as the most ignorant and gullible, except the gay ones of course.
