Holt,"[9, 9]","I agree with the others here: This is a wasted effort on the part of Roxbury/Infinity to bundle a mere handful of episodes onto a disc in no particular order, when fans are waiting for the FULL series. If they are going to waste their production effort on duplicating episodes like this, then they should go back and REMASTER Season 1, Volume 2, and give us a FULL FRAME edition to rectify the butchered one they are selling now with a cropped (FAKE) ""widescreen"" look.",1,A pointless DVD,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,469,"['agree', 'others', 'here', 'wasted', 'effort', 'part', 'Roxbury/Infinity', 'bundle', 'mere', 'handful', 'episodes', 'disc', 'particular', 'order', 'when', 'fans', 'are', 'waiting', 'FULL', 'series', 'are', 'going', 'waste', 'production', 'effort', 'duplicating', 'episodes', 'then', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'REMASTER', 'Season', '1', 'Volume', '2', 'give', 'FULL', 'FRAME', 'edition', 'rectify', 'butchered', 'one', 'are', 'selling', 'now', 'cropped', 'FAKE', 'widescreen', 'look']",Route 66: Classic Episodes

It's almost as if they randomly yanked (as opposed to ""hand-picked"") three episodes out of the vault with the notion that fans would buy anything. There's nothing thematic about this selection (they're not even from same season) and (with exception of casting of Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr. and Peter Lorre in one excrutiatingly goofy episode) they're not even particularly memorable shows.
