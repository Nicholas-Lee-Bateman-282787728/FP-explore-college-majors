I love the first and like the second film.  Fans of The Vampire Diaries will recognize her Beau who plays Mason in the TVD series.  Basically it's the ludicrous story of a &#34;blonde&#34; (in every sense of the word) who looks to prove to her boyfriend who jilted her that she's more than a pretty face surrounded by golden tresses by going to Harvard too.  Along the way she proves much more and to herself too.  Part two is very good but not as good as the first.

Was I ever pleasantly surprised by this delightfully funny comedy! Reese Witherspoon does a star turn as the not so dumb, California airhead blonde, Ellie Woods, who is dumped by her college sweetheart, Warner, before graduation, instead of getting the anticipated and expected marriage proposal. It appears that he has political aspirations and an ostensibly dumb and flamboyant blonde is not what he envisions having for a wife.Seeking to prove herself worthy and knowing that he is planning on attending Harvard Law School, Ellie, a fashion major, also seeks admission with dogged determination and studies her charming buns off in order to do well on the LSAT, the Law School Admission Test. Her high LSAT scores, coupled with her hilarious admission video, and her perfect college grade point average, albeit in Fashion, get her through the portals of Harvard Law School, and the games begin in earnest.What happens to her at Harvard is hilarious, as Ellie tries to get her former sweetheart back. She discovers, instead, something about herself that ultimately makes others sit up and take notice of her in a positive way. Reese Witherspoon is delightfully funny doing a comic turn and will have the viewer laughing almost immediately, while rooting for her. The supporting cast is likewise enjoyable. This is a funny, wacky comedy that is never mean spirited and is, instead, surprisingly uplifting.",4,BLONDES DO HAVE MORE FUN!...,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,1512,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'teenage', 'son', 'admit', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'high', 'Was', 'ever', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'delightfully', 'funny', 'comedy', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'star', 'turn', 'not', 'so', 'dumb', 'California', 'airhead', 'blonde', 'Ellie', 'Woods', 'who', 'dumped', 'college', 'sweetheart', 'Warner', 'graduation', 'instead', 'getting', 'anticipated', 'expected', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'political', 'aspirations', 'ostensibly', 'dumb', 'flamboyant', 'blonde', 'not', 'what', 'having', 'wife.Seeking', 'prove', 'worthy', 'knowing', 'planning', 'attending', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'Ellie', 'fashion', 'major', 'also', 'admission', 'dogged', 'determination', 'studies', 'charming', 'buns', 'off', 'order', 'do', 'well', 'LSAT', 'Law', 'School', 'Admission', 'Test', 'high', 'LSAT', 'scores', 'coupled', 'hilarious', 'admission', 'video', 'perfect', 'college', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'albeit', 'Fashion', 'get', 'portals', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'games', 'begin', 'Harvard', 'hilarious', 'Ellie', 'get', 'former', 'sweetheart', 'back', 'instead', 'something', 'ultimately', 'others', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'positive', 'way', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'delightfully', 'funny', 'doing', 'comic', 'turn', 'will', 'have', 'viewer', 'laughing', 'almost', 'immediately', 'rooting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'likewise', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'wacky', 'comedy', 'never', 'mean', 'spirited', 'instead', 'surprisingly', 'uplifting']",N/A
