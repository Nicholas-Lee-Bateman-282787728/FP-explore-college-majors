Vic's advice is to ""act normal"" when the co-conspirators temporarily part; Vic has the satchel of dough and Charlie is left with his increasingly frayed nerves. Charlie eventually calls attention to himself by visiting a series of strip joints, including one managed by the sultry Renata (Connie Nielsen)Now on the run, Charlie meets up with his very drunk and very unsubtle pal Pete (Oliver Platt). The two men are highly successful on Wichita terms, but monumentally dissatisfied with their lives. Charlie makes appalling choices that, perversely, appear to work in his favor, but will he actually end up with the money? And who will end up double-crossing whom?Set in a bleak, sleet soaked Kansas on Christmas Eve; the film is joltingly and brazenly nasty, with a pair of beautifully sardonic performances by John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton. Save for a last-minute stumble, the film mostly delivers the sinister goods. Adapted by Robert Benton and Richard Russo from Scott Philips' novel, the film crackles with deadpan and mordantly humorous dialogue delivered with the smooth gloss of permanent cynicismIce Harvest does take a little long to get going, and for the first thirty minutes the film doesn't really achieve the tension necessary to keep the action moving forward. The best moments occur after Cusack and Thornton shed the facade of partnership and get down and dirty. Once they resolve their differences, the movie is effectively over, save for the obligatory shooting.This film is perfect for those viewers who like their movies dark and edgy and who get a kick out of witnessing violent, bloody nihilism and horrible people doing horrible things to one another. There isn't much redemption for any of these characters, as they're people that you just love to hate. It's only Charlie, who imbues our sympathy as he finally manages to introduce a note of near-decorum in an absolute cacophony of sadistic and deplorable actions.

""Special"" because it's absolutely the DARKEST Christmas story you will EVER, EVER see!Harold Ramis directs neo-noirish THE ICE HARVEST (2005). Cast incudes John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Oliver Platt and Randy Quaid, among others.Set in Wichita, Kansas, the story opens late on Christmas Eve and unfolds in 12 hours. Cusack is lawyer to gangster/strip club owner Quaid. After much prodding from his potential partner-in-crime Thornton, nice guy Cusack embezzles $2 million from boss Quaid. Thornton acts unconcerned over Cusack's fears that Quaid will quickly find out who stole his cash and retaliate by having them both killed. He tells Cusack to ""act normal,"" an impossibility for the worry wart lawyer.After Thornton takes charge of their satchel of loot and with plans of them both leaving town for warmer climes right after the holiday, Cusack goes on a world class Xmas Eve bender with best frriend Platt, who's in a deep depression. Platt is unhappily married to Cusack's ex-wife. Real funny stuff happens on their strange night out, as Platt gets so manure-faced he's just conscious enough to mouth off to the wrong people.Almost immediately however, a thuggish hitman does indeed come looking for the thieves. Cusack gets a message from Thornton that ""You were right"" about the gunman and to meet him at the club (which is now closed).  Cusack notices a blood puddle on the floor inside the ominously deserted place. He follows its trail to a back room, where an amputated finger sits in a vise!

But be forewarned: it won't be for everyone. If you're a fan of John Cusack (specifically if you really, really, really loved GROSSE POINTE BLANK) then you'll probably enjoy the dark comedy flooding this film.Harold Ramis steps outside his normal feel-good comedies (ANALYZE THIS, etc.) and jumps headlong onto the dark side. Having the look and feel of a Cohen Brothers noir film, Ramis chose to incorporate old themes (good-looking but flawed guy falls for even more flawed girl while trying to pull a fast one) but did so using an updated script.The film opens with Charlie (Cusack), a lawyer for the local mob in Wichita Falls, stealing two-million dollars from ""The Boss"" and meeting up with his partner Vic (Billy Bob Thornton, BAD SANTA). They plan to leave the city in the morning but a horrendous ice storm hits town and life on the roads (and in general) becomes slippery and dangerous. A recurring poetic verse keeps popping up, too: ""As Wichita Falls, So Falls Wichita Falls."" Charlie keeps seeing it written everywhere. But who's the author and what does it mean?We quickly learn that Vic is as morally bankrupt as a person can get and has no intentions of sharing the ill-gotten funds with Charlie (are they really ill-gotten if you steal them from the mob?) But thrown into the mix is a beautiful femme fatal named Renata (Connie Nielsen, GLADIATOR). She runs a strip club in town but has an unusual attraction to Charlie, Vic and money. But which will win out?When mob boss Bill Gerard (Randy Quaid, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) discovers the theft, he puts a thug named Roy (Mike Starr, KNOCKAROUND GUYS) onto Charlie and Vic's tails. But when even that fails to pull Charlie and Vic in, the boss is forced to deal with the two thieves himself.The karma here is as dark as dark can get, but also amazingly funny. When Randy Quaid waves his gun around at a few of the characters and complains that he should be at home with his kids celebrating ""the birth of God"", it's actually quite funny in a very irrational way. Worrying more about money than the message a holiday like Christmas is supposed to represent fills every moment of screen time. Are they that far off when compared with the message of modern consumerism in December? Ouch.Watching the two additional alternate endings on the DVD made me thankful that they chose the theatrically released one; the other two were flat-out TOO dark. But the ending here will make you both laugh out loud and cringe.This movie was universally panned by film critics, which makes me sad that they couldn't see the humor associated with our counter-culture.Oh yes, and the ""As Wichita Falls, So Falls Wichita Falls"" verse.

Miles,"[4, 4]","Okay, let's be honest, a dark (if not black) comedy is a tough sell, and if you're not a fan of the genre chances are you tune out the minute you hear the phrase. So it's no surprise that ""The Ice Harvest"" did not fare well with critics or movie goers. It is an interesting mix of film noir and comedy that never really comes together, until the very end.On a dark, wet and miserable Christmas Eve in Wichita Kansas, Charlie (John Cusack) and Vic (Billy Bob Thornton) have just stolen $2.2 million from Charlie's boss, who just happens to be the local mob boss. All they have to do is lay low for a few hours and then they are off to the tropics with the loot in tow. Unfortunately Charlie has trouble lying low, and his growing mistrust in Vic doesn't help. When a mob hit man starts asking around as to Vic and Charlie's whereabouts, the whole plan starts to unravel and things go from bad to worse.Make no mistake this is a very dark film, and nearly every character is completely void of any redeeming qualities, so this may not be the film for you. However there are some pretty good performances by Cusack, Thornton, and several scene stealers by Oliver Platt who plays Charlie's drinking buddy Pete. There is also a bit of a long cameo by Randy Quaid near the end of the film. Given the dark tone of the film, the 89 minute running time is just about right, any longer and it may begin to feel almost burdensome. This movie will not leave you with any good feelings but the clever twist at the end does help you feel that your time was justified.

Phillips has a great ear for dialogue, which by & large survived the transition into screenplay form.  However, there are some significant differences between the novel and the film, not the least of which is the ending.  Scott Phillips was involved to a certain extent in the production of the film, and I have to assume that he was OK with these alterations --- but I can't help but think that the movie would have been more effective if it had remained faithful to the novel all the way through.Additionally, although I like John Cusack generally, I wasn't entirely satisfied with his portrayal of Charlie Arglist, who comes off as a doofus way in over his head.  The Charlie Arglist in the novel may be in the dark on a lot of details, but he is not an idiot, nor is he out of control of his own destiny --- something which the novel's end makes all that much more poignant.  This poignancy was missing from the movie, and while reviewers may not have realized it, perhaps this is one of the reasons that this film was not well-received.So --- even though I enjoyed it, I would give it a very qualified four stars, owing largely to some solid performances from Billy Bob Thornton & Oliver Platt.

963479,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000DZ7YN8,Cubist,"[9, 10]","Right from the opening shot director Harold Ramis establishes the icy coldness of the film's wintery, mid-western setting. It's a shot of John Cusack huddled in a long, black coat, bracing himself against a chilly wind in such a way that you can almost feel the cold, it is that tangible. The opening credits play over a montage of establishing shots that show off the geography of the city through a gun metal blue filter. Ramis knows how to create the right atmosphere as Charlie goes from one murky, seedy bar to the next.The Ice Harvest is done in the same tradition as other anti-Christmas movies like The Ref and Bad Santa but perhaps its closest cinematic cousin is Fargo in the way the violence is depicted: surprisingly awkward, bloody and brutal. Ramis refreshingly moves away from predictable fare like Analyze This and Analyze That with this off-kilter crime comedy. It's a movie that doesn't follow the usual beats. For example, the actual crime takes place before the film even starts. Charlie and Vic are supposed to be partners in crime and yet we rarely see them together until 50 minutes into the movie.Ramis constantly subverts our expectations at every turn. The fun of this kind of movie is trying to anticipate the various plot twists and the surprises as characters reveal their true nature. One thing that is true about neo noirs, they rarely end well and Charlie is going to have to navigate very dangerous waters if he's going to survive the night. The Ice Harvest follows an unpredictable trajectory with Charlie as the only constant.There are two alternate endings, both in which things don't turn out so well for Charlie. The first one is much more haunting while the other reunites Charlie, Vic and Renata and is not as strong.""Outtake with Billy Bob Thornton"" is an amusing take on a scene with Cusack where Thornton reprises his Carl character from Sling Blade (1996) much to everyone's amusement.""Cracking the Story"" features a conversation between screenwriters Richard Russo and Robert Benton and author Scott Phillips. It's a spirited, informative and entertaining discussion.""Beneath the Harvest"" is a standard if not informative making of featurette that mixes cast and crew soundbites with clips from the movie. There is also some decent, on-location footage including shooting a scene on a very cold, rainy night.""Ice Cracking: Analysis of a Scene"" examines the icy lake scene - the centerpiece of the movie. It shows how the filmmakers created a lake, the ice in it and so on.Finally, there is an audio commentary with director Ramis.

963481,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000DZ7YN8,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[9, 11]","There's cute dark comedy (like ""Ghost World"") and then there's pitch black dark comedy. ""The Ice Harvest"" is the latter. It is a vile, profane, violent movie. And that's why I love it. Or almost do. By the end of ""The Ice Harvest"" almost every single main onscreen character in the film has died a brutal, and in most cases prolonged, death. There is harldy one likeable character in the movie, and the only one that is mildly likeable is killed off very early on. ""Bad Santa"", a movie with a similar premise, was similarly dark, and more profane by a long shot. But it was less violent and had more funny moments. That movie also starred Billy Bob Thorton, but he was the main character in that movie. In this one, he gets hardly any screen time until the second half. John Cusack is good in his performance, but many will wonder why someone successful as his character would do something as stupid as his character does in this movie. The movie has alot of very noticeable plot holes, though. Imeediately noticeable, unfortunately. In one scene a police officer is killed and his partner is out in the squad car. Would the other one not come in to investigate after a while? Another, when the single surviving character gets the money, occurs towards the end of the movie. Alright, so you live in a small Kansas town. You just stole $2 million, you have a stolen car, and there are ten or more bodies that you had something to do with the death of? Wouldn't the police come after you? Not according to this movie. There are alot of dark moments here. Others are pitch black in their presentation. Yet, there are moments that are hilarious and not dark at all. One scene that is particularly funny was one in which Oliver Platt's character is convinced one of his testicles has retreated into his body because of a fight he just got into. He eventually persuades Cusack's chracter to bounce him up and down until it, um, returns home. And nothing is funnier that hearing Oliver Platt scream in front of several police officers ""Charlie! Charlie! Three times fast! That should get it out!"" There is another absoloutely hilarious scene where Platt tells a bartender what she'll be wearing in his fantasy about her. Connie Nielsen is great as Renata, a strip club owner who can't understand why ""just because it's Christmas people can't look at my strippers!""The movie centers around Charlie Arglist (Cusack), a high powered mob lawyer and his friend Vic (Thornton), a pornography salesman. They decide to steal $2 million from Charlie's boss, Bill Geurrard (Randy Quaid). They get the money (in fact the movie begins with that) and the two decide to meet up later in the night at Vic's strip club, the Velvet Touch. Over the seven hour period of time that must elapse before either of them can meet and get out of town, Vic goes to the fanciest restaurant in town and then home. Charlie has a more interesting night (at first glance) and drinks himself into a stupor. He goes to the Sweet Cage, Renata's strip bar, and hits on Renata. Then he goes to the restaurant Vic is at and meets up with Pete (Platt) and gets even more drunk. Then he goes to Pete's house, where a fight between the entire family takes place and Charlies kids, (Charlie used to be married to Sarabeth, who's now Pete's wife), also present, tear him to pieces. Both leave the house and go to another bar. At this time, Charlie realizes something is amiss and tries to make contact with Vic. See, one of Bill's henchmen has been following Charlie in and out of bars all night. Charlie panics and goes to the Velvet Touch early, where he finds a severed finger in a vice that may or may not be Vic's, as well as other torture tools (scissors and a scalpel). Charlie fears the worst and goes over to Vic's house, where he himself has had an unbelievable run in with the thug. Charlie goes back to Renata's bar and gives her a gift he has had for her all night, and she finds out about Charlie's plan. If it sounds like I'm giving too much away, I'm not. The real important stuff doesn't happen until the end, I will not even attempt to explain it.The reason I won't attempt explaining it is because it's so in depth and so twisty that I would need to see the movie again to get it. In that lies where ""The Ice Harvest"", up until now a brilliant and dark noirish story, turns into a roller coaster full of twists and jolting curves. Someone will double cross someone, only to be double crossed by another person, who triple crosses another guy, and the first guy ends up getting stabbed. This movie suffers mainly from not knowing what it wants to be or what it is. At one moment it's a parody of noir movies, like ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" and just as broad. The next moment it is serious, dark, and still pretty damn funny. Randy Quaid's role is tiny, and that is a good thing. The end could have been so stylish if Hammy Quaid (both the meat and the acting style) hadn't, um, hammed it up so badly. Then there are the cliches, only two or three, suprisingly, but women are refferred to as 'dames', and spend most of the finally tied up (or are strippers). Then there is a sort of cool but ultimately predictable scene (that we've seen many a time) where a man shoots a person that is leaning against in the chest, only to have the person, as they fall back dead, cut the shooters throat. On accident, of course, but it's old. That brings up another one of my gripes. The violence that dominates the third act of the movie is by no means gratuitous, it's just horrendously graphic for a movie like this. A movie of this sort does not need  action-movie-style blood spurting. Not that it's hard to watch, it isn't. It's entertaining in the way it's presented, but just a little too graphic, two times in particular. The violence in ""Bad Santa"" was not bad at all, and actually quite brief. One of the many contrasts between the two sort of similar movies. The movie will inevitable remind some of ""Fargo"" because of the murder and mayhem like plot, but it reminded me a little of ""Bad Santa"". ""The Ice Harvest"" was a good, darkly hilarious movie. It is a whole lot better than the previews make it look. It's a good movie, sure to become a cult classic, as ""Bad Santa"" did. But it's not for everyone, that's certain.Director: Harold RamisLength: 88 minutes (1 hour 28 minutes)MPAA Rating: R for Violence (several bloody shootings, a couple drownings, a few stabbings, implied torture, a severed thumb, gruesome scene with a corpse wrapped in plastic being shoved into a car trunk, fights, including severly broken fingers and references to other broken bones), Language (the usual amount of F-words and its derivatives for this sort of movie, as well as more traditional swear words), and Sexuality/Nudity (sexual references, several brief sex scenes, all in videos shown in the background of the strip bar scenes, topless and semi-naked strippers, subplot about a picture of a local political figure in an ""uncomfortable position"" with his mistress, but it is only glimpsed very very briefly.)",4,Darkly Hilarious 'Ice Harvest' Better Than It Looks,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,7058,"['cute', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Ghost', 'World', 'then', 'pitch', 'black',

963483,A3HD7SVBY4JZOW,B000DZ7YN8,Donegal Dan,"[4, 7]","I am a fan of black comedy and an even bigger fan of John Cusack, generally.  In this film you get both, perhaps not at their very best, but pretty good.  Actually, I think Cusack is the gem in this story--his Charlie, the mob lawyer, is very funny in a deadpan way (think Grosse Point Blank) and his portrayal of the weary, cynical, yet sadly hopeful purloiner of 2 million of his boss's money is  classic Cusack.  Billy Bob Thornton, as his untrustworthy sidekick, is in a familiar mold, too, though not such a funny one.  And Oliver Platt, usually one of my favorites, provided a big dollop of  broad comedy with a drunken performance that was dangerously close to the edge. According to the interviews in the bonus additions to the DVD, Platt was apparently given his head in how he played his character (Charlie's best friend now married, unhappily, to Charlie's ex-wife) and I would say he overdid it a bit.  Be that as it may, the only really weak spot in the casting was Connie Nielsen, who didn't generate any very believable heat or jazz up the proceedings much. Overall, I rate this 4 stars primarily because of Cusack's performance and  because of the comical  juxtaposition of  the harebrained scheme to steal the money against the background of Christmas carols and platitudes (I am reminded of ""The Ref"", another very funny black comedy set at Christmas).This movie is definitely worth seeing if you like irreverence, the noir genre, and John Cusack.",4,Another Funny (not hilarious)John Cusack Black Comedy,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,1465,"['am', 'fan', 'black', 'comedy', 'even', 'bigger', 'fan', 'John', 'Cusack', 'generally', 'film', 'get', 'perhaps', 'not', 'very', 'best', 'pretty', 'good', 'Actually', 'think', 'Cusack', 'gem', 'story', 'Charlie', 'mob', 'lawyer', 'very', 'funny', 'deadpan', 'way', 'think', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'Blank', 'portrayal', 'weary', 'cynical', 'yet', 'sadly', 'hopeful', 'purloiner', '2', 'million', 'boss', 'money', 'classic', 'Cusack', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'untrustworthy', 'sidekick', 'familiar', 'mold', 'too', 'not', 'funny', 'one', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'usually', 'one', 'favorites', 'provided', 'big', 'dollop', 'broad', 'comedy', 'drunken', 'performance', 'was', 'dangerously', 'close', 'edge', 'According', 'interviews', 'bonus', 'additions', 'DVD', 'Platt', 'was', 'apparently', 'given', 'head', 'how', 'played', 'character', 'Charlie', 'best', 'friend', 'now', 'married', 'unhappily', 'Charlie', 'ex-wife', 'would', 'say', 'overdid', 'bit', 'Be', 'may', 'only', 'really', 'weak', 'spot', 'casting', 'was', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'generate', 'very', 'believable', 'heat', 'jazz', 'up', 'proceedings', 'much', 'Overall', 'rate', '4', 'stars', 'primarily', 'Cusack', 'performance', 'comical', 'juxtaposition', 'harebrained', 'scheme', 'steal', 'money', 'background', 'Christmas', 'carols', 'platitudes', 'am', 'reminded', 'Ref', 'very', 'funny', 'black', 'comedy', 'set', 'Christmas', '.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'irreverence', 'noir', 'genre', 'John', 'Cusack']",N/A

It's a subtle but crucial difference, and a successful change in tone for director Harold Ramis.  Richard Russo and Robert Benton's adaptation of Scott Phillips' novel tells the suspenseful yet surreally funny Kansas-set story of nervous Mob lawyer John Cusack teaming up with laid-back yet ruthless Billy Bob Thornton to steal over $2 million from their  kingpin boss Randy Quaid, only to find themselves stuck in Wichita by an ice storm and all manner of goof-ups and goofballs, with a hit man on their tail to-boot, TIH tells its twisted tale as if my fave thriller author Jim Thompson (THE GRIFTERS, THE GETAWAY, POP. 1280, among others) wrote it in a jovial mood -- though I suspect that in a jovial mood, Thompson would have been more likely to smirk than belly-laugh.  Set on Christmas Eve, TIH starts with the best unexpected holiday-themed credits since 1947's LADY IN THE LAKE and only gets more gleefully malevolent from there.  You know our antiheroes are literally in for a blue Christmas, thanks to Alar Kivilo's sleek azure-tinged photography.  Cusack and Thornton make such a good team that I'm now eager to rent their previous collaboration, PUSHING TIN, even though I've heard mixed reviews of that, too.  Oliver Platt has been touted as TIH's scene-stealer in the role of Cusack's friend who stole his wife and, having lived to regret it, spends the whole film getting drunk and hilariously obnoxious.  Platt's a hoot, all right, but Thornton has the slyest lines; his explanation of how his wife ends up killed by the hit man is evilly funny, all the more so for Thornton's matter-of-fact delivery.  Connie Nielsen also deserves kudos for stealing her own scenes more subtly and sensuously as the sexy owner of The Sweet Cage, one of many strip joints in town that Cusack frequents (I came away from the movie thinking strip joints must be a cottage industry in Wichita).  Nielsen looks like a Petty Girl or Varga Girl come to life, fresh from the pages of a vintage Esquire issue.  If you want a wicked little tongue-in-cheek noir as an antidote to the season's holiday cheer, TIH may well be your cup of hemlock.

Their plan is to act unobtrusively until they can get out of town, that is, Wichita Falls, Kansas (apparently shot in the real winter in communities just north of Chicago).  In fact, Charlie is confronted by all kinds of mishaps as he bumbles his way through the ""silent night"" into ... well, if you decided to see it, I won't divulge.This movie is a compendium of a lot of other film noir-black comedy ones, is unoriginal, poorly acted and in the main, a ripoff.

But it doesn't work, because, alas, Harold Ramis fails as a director.  Reviewers speak of Connie Nielsen (Renata)and John Cusack's characters as weary:  the whole cast is weary.  (Watch Billy Bob pretend to take a pratfall kicking a foot locker full of mob assassin in his garage.  Pathetic.)  It's a pretty bad movie, folks, one from the recycle bin of original ones.  (It's not even as good as ""Blood Simple"" or ""Fargo."")  One substantive comment:  it collapses from not enough real humor:  could've learned something from ""Fargo.""  There are too many loathsome characters doing loathsome, seamy things.  Maybe the lack of humor is because the script writers, too, were weary.

This is one of the better film noir entries into the black comedy version that has appeared in a long time.  Director Harold Ramis knows how to move his talented cast around in a never-a-dull-moment adventure that no matter how bizarre the many twists become, the viewer is glued to the screen afraid to miss a moment of the convoluted plat.Charlie Arglist (John Cusack) is a lawyer for the crime mob in Wichita, Kansas informs us at the beginning that though people say there is no such thing as a perfect crime, he is about to show us one.  It seems Charlie has found a way to steal a hefty amount of cash from Kansas City crime bass Bill Guerrard (Rand Quaid) but must enlist the help of pornographer/strip club owner Vic (Billy Bob Thornton) to carry it off.  Once Charlie has the 2 million dollars and turns it over to Vic, all manner of bizarre events occur.  Charlie's best friend is a drunk Pete (Oliver Platt) who, in addition to being inebriated every moment, has married Charlie's ex-wife.  Charlie pines after stripper  Renata (Connie Nielson) and this entanglement has its own sour repercussions.  The crux of the story is how in one short Christmas Eve the ideal heist meets with every possible bad consequence, leaving the ending as a sparkling surprise that only makes the audience feel guilty that they should have  noticed all the clues along the way!Cusack, Platt, Thornton, Quaid, and Nielsen turn in tour de force performances, rasty, silly and wild as they come.  The pacing of the film is so fast that the story seems to whiz by in a flash of ludicrous events.  There is a lot of violence and a lot of dialogue that is as raw as the strip club scenery, but it all works.  Very well.  Few cinematographers have been able to capture the sleazy ice slick atmosphere of midwinter bleakness in a dowdy area of Kansas (though shot in Illinois) as well as  Alar Kivilo.  The DVD offers two alternative endings,  each every different from the chosen one, as well as some outtakes by Billy Bob Thornton and director coments that are fun and entertaining.

Oliver Platt is extremely funny, too, as the main character's best friend...who happens to be obnoxiously (and hilariously) drunk through most of the movie.Although funny, ""Ice Harvest"" is also a crime drama, so there's plenty of killing, violence, and foul language.  I rather like all three in a movie, and don't believe this one would work without them.  Just keep that in mind before gathering the kiddies 'round the TV.As for the acting, Cusack is wonderfully befuddled, Thornton is just OK, and Connie Nielson is beautiful and sexy, but her uninspired role could have been played by a dozen other similar actresses.

The story covers about 12 hours from dusk of Christmas eve to dawn of Christmas morning. The weather is abysmal. The location is Wichita.

Thornton is Cusack's co-thief with plenty of other agendas.I had liked the book by Scott Philips. Then I saw the film in a movie theater, and watched it again some time later on DVD.

Some people writing reviews here must have been in a different show or must have been looking for an action thriller. Tough luck, guys.It is essentially a story about middle-aged men and their strange behaviour around money and women. Its humour is not of the slapstick kind, it is slow and very dark.Cusack is the center, with Thornton and Platt as main planets.

In this case, however, its almost a toss up.  While the movie follows the book pretty closely, the screenplay includes some nice improvements.  Perhaps the best was the relationship between Pete and Charlie.  In the book, they are merely inlaws, but the fact that Pete married Charlie's ex-wife (who they both now despise) is a twist that really adds flavor to the story.  So does the crooked cop who, unwittingly, saves Charlie's bacon. In addition, the ""As Witchita Falls, so Falls Witchita Falls"" schtick enhances the existential aura of the movie (though it may only make sense if you watch the alternative ending). All in all, the movie has better dialog and sharper edges than the book.That being said, the book STILL works better than the movie.  Its hard to pinpoint why, but I blame the dark mood of the story.  Dark plots are par-for-the-course in books, but tricky on the big screen (especially during the Holidays--which is probably why it bombed).  The Ice Harvest is no different in this respect.  The Hollywood ending cheers things up a bit, but seems forced and (without spoiling it) a little hard to believe.  The book ending is much more consistent with the rest of the story.  If you look at the alternative endings on DVD, you'll see that something close to the book ending was actually filmed.

John Cusack plays Charlie, a lawyer for mobsters who has just stolen over two million dollars from one of his clients. His partner, Vic (Billy Bob Thornton) takes the money and Charlie goes to a strip joint in the hopes to convince Renata (Connie Nielsen) to run away with him. That's when Charlie realizes that people are asking around about him and Vic. Then, Charlie's drunk friend Pete (Oliver Platt) shows up and a couple sub-plots surrounding Charlie and Pete lead us along through the plot. The movie doesn't really hit it's comedic stride until about 50 minutes in. The main ""funnymen"" in the movie are Thornton and Platt, but it is a ""dark comedy"" which usually means it features humorous events that aren't really that funny.As I said before, the movie is very entertaining; but it's also very short (84 minutes). Randy Quaid (Kingpin, Brokeback Mountain) shows up about 69 minutes in as the mobster Charlie has stolen the money from, but his appearance is little more than a cameo. Nielsen is like a chameleon with her acting style, she looks different in every role (Gladiator, One Hour Photo, etc.) and she looks spectacular here. I haven't seen Cusack in a movie forever and he's returning to the form he had in ""Grosse Point Blank"".Thornton plays the wife-hating partner, that Charlie isn't sure he can trust perfectly. Thornton has established himself as a serious dramatic actor, but he is very funny (as we've seen with this movie, Bad Santa, and others). Platt really is the funniest guy in the movie, which attributes to the films dialogue which is really good. Anyway, for a dark and entertaining crime film this movie hits the target. I highly recommend it.GRADE: A-",5,The Ice Harvest,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,1779,"['Ice', 'Harvest', 'dark', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'really', 'funny', 'pretty', 'damn', 'entertaining', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Charlie', 'lawyer', 'mobsters', 'who', 'just', 'stolen', 'over', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'one', 'clients', 'partner', 'Vic', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'money', 'Charlie', 'strip', 'joint', 'hopes', 'convince', 'Renata', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'run', 'away', 'when', 'Charlie', 'people', 'are', 'asking', 'Vic', 'Then', 'Charlie', 'drunk', 'friend', 'Pete', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'up', 'couple', 'sub-plots', 'surrounding', 'Charlie', 'Pete', 'lead', 'plot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'hit', 'comedic', 'stride', '50', 'minutes', 'main', 'funnymen', 'movie', 'are', 'Thornton', 'Platt', 'dark', 'comedy', 'usually', 'humorous', 'events', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'funny.As', 'said', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'also', 'very', 'short', '84', 'minutes', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Kingpin', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'up', '69', 'minutes', 'mobster', 'Charlie', 'stolen', 'money', 'appearance', 'little', 'more', 'cameo', 'Nielsen', 'chameleon', 'acting', 'style', 'different', 'role', 'Gladiator', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'etc', 'spectacular', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Cusack', 'movie', 'forever', 'returning', 'form', 'had', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'Blank', '.Thornton', 'wife-hating', 'partner', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'sure', 'can', 'trust', 'perfectly', 'Thornton', 'established', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'very', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'others', 'Platt', 'really', 'funniest', 'guy', 'movie', 'films', 'dialogue', 'really', 'good', 'Anyway', 'dark', 'entertaining', 'crime', 'film', 'movie', 'target', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

It's certainly a movie I had anticipated liking--a noirish black comedy, that's right down my alley.  The cast is good, the idea/storyline promising.  Some individual elements worked well, but ultimately I don't think the film came together as I had hoped it would.  There is a general awkwardness of tone which throws everything out of whack.The major problem is that the comedy elements by themselves aren't strong enough to sustain the film.  And the thriller elements by themselves aren't strong enough, either.  Putting them together doesn't necessarily make anything better, it highlights the shortcomings in each.  I didn't dislike the movie, however, it's diverting enough for 90 minutes--but I certainly have no passion to recommend it.John Cusack is an appealing, and often underrated performer, and I liked him here.  The breakout, as everyone else has highlighted, though is Oliver Platt.  It's a spot-on comedy performance--in fact, he better be careful--this character is becoming his trademark, his typecasting.

""The Hospital"" is still my personal standard and the black comedy by which all others are judged, which might be a tad unfair since Paddy Chayefsky won an Oscar for writing that one.  But the screenplay for ""The Ice Harvest"" was written by Richard Russo (""Empire Falls"") and Robert Benton (""Places in the Heart"") from the novel by Scott Phillips, which is not bad writing team.  It is just that this 2005 film never really clicks on all cylinders and only gets going at the end, which might be a tad too late for many viewers.Charlie Arglist (John Cusack) is a mob lawyer in Wichita, Kansas, which might sound like an oxymoron but happens to be his peculiar reality.  The holiday season has come and Charlie and his friend Vic (Billy Bob Thornton), a pornographer, have stolen $2.2 million belonging to the local mob boss, Bill Guerrard (Randy Quaid), who as you might suspect is a killer.  However, their plane out of town to a warmer climate far, far away from Guerrard does not leave until the next morning and these two might not be alive by then.  Charlie is hanging out at a strip club where he is attracted to the manager, Renata (Connie Nielsen), who might express more of an interest in poor Charlie if only Charlie were not so poor.It is hard for Charlie to keep a low profile, because his friend Pete (Oliver Platt, playing a slightly more boisterous version of his character on ""Huff""), tends to announce that Charlie is a mob lawyer in a loud voice everyplace they go.  But this all appears to be moot because Roy Gelles (Mike Starr), one of Guerrard's hit men is asking around town for Charlie and this cannot be a good thing.  Throw into the mix the fact that Vic is acting squirrelly and Charlie is seriously thinking about taking Renata along for the good life he is planning on living someplace else, and the permutations as to how badly this can all end for Charlie are increasing geometrically.Given the fine cast that director Harold Ramis collected for this film, it is interesting that (a) the actor who steals the film is Mike Starr and that (b) he does this while being locked in a trunk.  Being locked in a trunk is the sort of think that can kill your career as a hit man, especially if you are missing a thumb (tell the truth: did you not think it was something else, something worse, when you saw the vise?), but Roy keeps making threats and you tend to believe the guy.  These scenes are the funniest in the film, mainly because they are more understated that the rest of the film, which tends to pale a bit in comparison.However, the last act definitely picks up once every thing unravels (or comes together, depending on your particular point of view), so you patience in getting through a lot of the early stuff will be rewarded.  Charlie ends up being the ""hero"" in this one pretty much by default, and there is not the usually engaging performance by Cusak to help carry this one along because his character is such a dim-bulb, which only adds to our anticipation that he is going to meet a bad end.  In the end I round up on this one because they went with this ending rather than the alternative one (there are two alternative endings but they end the same).  I was afeared it was going to end the alternative way, which at that point would have been the final nail in the coffin, but they avoided the temptation and I was relieved.

With ""Ice Harvest,"" he moves squarely into the black comedy or tragicomedy genre with films such as ""Fargo"" or ""Pulp Fiction."" ""Ice Harvest"" emphasizes character & dialogue more than action.  Some of the scenes in this film are hysterical such as the main characters hauling the hit man off to the ice-covered pond and having a discussion with the guy locked in a trunk in the back seat.  Billy Bob Thornton does perform some great comic maneuvers such as trying to get the trunk into the Mercedes.  Oscar nominated for Best Actor for ""Sling Blade"" and Best Supporting Actor for ""A Simple Plan"" & with ""School for Scoundrels"" about to hit the cinema screen, Billy Bob has generated a body of work usually playing offbeat bad guys.  He plays well with John Cusack who will soon be seen in Australian director Bruce Beresford's ""The Contract"" and has 3 films scheduled for release next year (""1408,"" ""Grace is Gone,"" & ""The Martian Child"").  Cusack balances relatively successfully the morality-neutral mob lawyer with the nice guy with a conscience.  The heist of $2 million + from mob boss Bill Gerard does NOT go off without a hitch of course.  Randy Quaid, Oscar-nominated only once for Best Supporting Actor for ""The Last Detail"" in 1973, does a good job as the ruthless gangster Gerard.  Charlie loses a bit of his heart to Renata played in film noir style by Connie Nielsen from ""Mission to Mars"" & ""One-Hour Photo.""  Oliver Platt, who will re-team with Cusack in ""The Martian Child"" and has played in a couple of my old favorites ""Bulworth"" & ""Simon Birch"" from 1998 as well as ""Kinsey"" in 2004 & ""Casanova"" in 2005, adds a great comedy touch as husband #2 of Charlie's ex-wife.  His drunken scenes transform Christmas into everything you hope it not to be.  Barkeep Roy is played hilariously by Mike Starr who is in the current release ""The Black Dahlia.""  There is another great cameo by T.J. Jagodowski as Officer Tyler who keeps trying to get Charlie to remember his name & bumbles into a bullet in the brain at the hands of Bill Gerard.  Based on a novel by Scott Phillips, I found ""Ice Harvest"" to be remarkably funny considering the body count achieved by the end of the picture!

963507,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B000DZ7YN8,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[7, 12]","What a shame...the novel on which this is based, of the same name by Scott Philips, is an almost absolutely perfect Midwestern noir. It's a zinger and well worth reading if you love sharp, biting crime novels. The ending of the novel is perfect, and the rest of it is just the same.But this film version loses a whole heck of a lot in translation. You can feel the ""halfness"" in almost every frame. As another reviewer mentioned, only Oliver Platt puts any feeling into his character, but nobody else does; all the other actors/characters are in a kind of semi-dazed stumble through a weak script that doesn't seem to care very much if the characters really have anything they themselves care about. In fact, it really feels like nobody cares about ANYTHING much at all in this film.The thing that's so peculiar is that Richard Russo, a talented writer, adapted the novel along with Robert Benton. However, when you stop and think about it, maybe that's not so surprising. Benton, no matter how hard he tries, just can't really do crime. ""The Late Show"" should be called ""The Gong Show"" and ""Twilight"" is really ""Here's Paul Newman in a Movie about Crime that sort of, you know, ambles along"". The same is true here for ""The Ice Harvest"", only this time it's John Cusack, not Paul Newman who's here along with Billy Bob Thornton, the aforementioned Oliver Platt (who's great), Connie Neilsen as a kind of half-hearted femme fatale, Randy Quaid as a caricature-type mob boss kinda guy, and Mike Starr as an enforcer (read: hit man) who's also very good, albeit in a small role.The reason ""Analyze This"" worked so well is that Harold Ramis, the director, worked with broad humor aimed directly at the mob; he was in his milieu and DeNiro and Crystal carried it off really well. But the humor in ""The Ice Harvest"" is anything but broad; it's meant to be dark and winds up being just...not much at all. Cusack is good in smart alecky roles, but here the script really can't decide if he should be smart alecky or weighted down with the burden of guilt for all the things he does in the course of the film. On top of that, he's a father to two kids, so the emotional range here is so out of whack it just loses everything; we don't really know WHAT kind of guy he really is. We get snippets here and there because of all these different types of situations (added to which is his supposed crush on the famme fatale), but nothing substantial at all.Do yourself a favor and read the novel this was based on. Its ending is razor sharp and mordantly funny and totally different from the ending of the film. The novel is great, truly. The film...is not.

When the film opens we quickly learn that John Cusack, who plays a mob lawyer, has just stolen more than $2 million from his boss.  He brings it all to his friend Billy Bob Thornton who drives off with the money and tells Cusack to stay cool till the next morning when they will meet at the airport.But the night is long and John Cusack is thrust into one outlandish mess after another.  There's his drunken friend played by Oliver Platt who is now married to Cusack's former wife and who has lived to regret it.  There's Connie Nielsen, who manages a mob-owned strip club who wants a special kind of favor.  Billy Bob Thornton is involved intrigue and a couple of murders as well as double crossing.

963509,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000DZ7YN8,Mark,"[3, 5]","If you gave the Dukes of Hazzard or Waiting... more than one star, then this is not the movie for you.  If, on the other hand, you found those two movies to be utterly contemptable, than this is a hysterically funny movie.  When I watch movies, I award generous points for originality, even if the movie was just decent.  Well, this movie was extremely funny and it was completely original, shying from becoming an average cookie-cutter comedy, like every Ryan Reynolds movie ever made (not that Reynolds is a bad actor, he just takes terrible parts.  On the contrary, he has Chevy Chase potential).  If you read some of my other reviews, as well as look at my Top Ten of 2005 Listmania, you will have noticed that I also gave Gore Verbinski's The Weather Man five stars and put it at number nine on the top ten list.  I did this for two reasons.  One, people often sway towards serious, thought provoking movies, and steer clear of the comedy, and, if anything, comedies have a harder task of pleasing an audience.  For a comedy to please me fully, such as The Ice Harvest and The Weather Man, it has to be well rounded.  Secondly, the originality of the script plays a huge role in my critiques.  Both of these films are filled with such ingenuity and originality that I couldn't help but like them.  John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton are really good in this movie, but, like Richard Roeper, I wish that the Academy would take comedies more seriously and nominate people such as Steve Carell for the 40 Year Old Virgin, and, in this case, Oliver Platt.  I see the importance of George Clooney in Syriana and Paul Giamatti in Cinderella Man, but I don't think it would kill anybody to give a nod to a good comedy every once in a while.  That being said, Oliver Platt is most of the comedy in this semi-serious movie.  He adds light to this otherwise dark comedy.  Harold Ramis hasn't made a better movie since Groundhog Day, although Analyze This was pretty good.

963525,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000DZ7YN8,Peter Shermeta,"[2, 3]","I liked John Cusack's character (Charlie). He is a mob boss's lawyer, so he has probably worked a few too many hours, which has caused at least one woman to walk out of his life. He is just not happy with his station in life; something needs to change. He tells a story about how his father always played by the rules and respected the law. He wanted his son to grow up a lawyer and protect those same rules he held so dear. And we can imagine that working within the confines of those rules to assist a man who does bad things is as close as Charlie has come rebelling or acting out. The character really allowed Cusack to get back to the type of acting that makes me like him so much. He is a nicer guy than he tries to let on. He is on edge, angry about something that may have never happened. And he is impatient. It was refreshing to see old Cusack in a new role.Billy Bob Thornton (Vic), as far as I am concerned, was just another actor in this movie. I probably shouldn't admit that I am generally a fan of his work. I like his personality and the quirks he brings to his work. (There, I said it.) There wasn't much depth to Vic. Putting Thornton in the movie helped impress people with the names associated with the project I am sure, but I think he was underutilized.I never thought I would say that the highlight of any movie I had seen was the performance delivered by Oliver Platt. I mean no disrespect to Mr. Platt, but in what few roles I have seen him in, he has not played any characters that have left a positive impression on me...until now. His character Pete, the drunk, unhappy architect, brought some much needed comedy to The Ice Harvest. He had what may be seen as the easy job of delivering the best lines in the movie, but I think he brought a lot to those lines and did a great job.As for the movie itself, I think it was good for the performances by Cusack and Platt. It was in the theaters so long ago that I was able to let go of the expectations that once had been for a great movie. I did not love the movie, but I am glad I was able to watch it somewhat objectively and enjoy it for what it was and not see it through let-down eyes.

963530,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000DZ7YN8,Samuel McKewon,"[4, 5]","""The Ice Harvest"" is a chilly and dark little venture through 90 minutes of film noir, where the laughs are depressingly funny and mostly in the excellent delivery of actors John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton and Oliver Platt. It's set on a Christmas Eve in Wichita, a time and place I've experienced, and this movie adequately captures the mood: Gray, a little wet, populated with people who don't seem to be from around Wichita, or aren't sure why they're in Wichita, or don't want to be in Wichita. It's a glorious locale - perched between the strip malls of the new South and the cattle ranches of the old Midwest, chirpy and docile, Christian and good ol' boy hellraisin'. And the weather is its own violent streak. Tornado Alley in the summer. Ice Alley in the winter.Charlie (Cusack) and Vic (Thornton) fully intend to leave the city - with $2.2 million stolen from a mob boss (Randy Quaid). A sleet storm delays their escape until morning. The screenplay from Academy-Award winner Robert Benton (""The Human Stain"" most recently) and Pulitzer Prize winner Richard Russo (""Empire Falls"") unfolds first as a tour of bar life, replete with a heart-of-gold stripper (Connie Nielsen) and drunken friend Peter (Platt), who's married to Charlie's ex-wife, before blooming into violence that borrows from ""Fargo,"" among other pictures. Thornton's mere presence casts a shadow on Vic, and there comes a point where his loyalties are conflicted. At best.Director Harold Ramis is content to let the movie succeed on how clearly he captures details. The dull, morbid life of strippers. The painful effort it takes to dispose of a body. The lonely shame of a dad buying gas station teddy bears for his kids' Christmas. That one cop, out all night, who just keeps showing up and showing up, that same mocking grin glued to his lips. There's something poetically bleak about the Plains in winter, an empty, regretful, sky-swallows-you-whole feeling, and whichever tropic Charlie's running with his money, he'll take the years he weathered in Wichita with him. And a lot of dark memories of his last night there.Cusack is nearing an age where the jowls and tired eyes are performances unto themselves, and here he has captured weariness and muted desire. Charlie is pretty rotten, really - he doesn't look like he'll miss his children at all - but he's a harmless sack who has a certain charm that works with a certain kind of woman. And Nielsen, as smoky-voiced stripper, is subtle in her ways of showing, despite her purr, that she isn't that girl. Her nature is doled out in small portions until her intentions are evident. Thornton carves out space for the brutal, clever Vic, too greedy and vengeful by half. Only Quaid, playing for broad comedy, whiffs; he's as off in this cameo as he was excellent as the turgid cattle boss in ""Brokeback Mountain.""A straight comedy it is not, and a caper it is not. Women looking for a Cusack Saturday night should definitely skip. ""The Ice Harvest"" is instead that polished whiskey-ordering gentleman in the corner booth. He likes himself, his drink, and how he drinks it.",3,"Classy, old-school noir of jowls, guns and a dark Christmas",1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,3103,"['Ice', 'Harvest', 'chilly', 'dark', 'little', 'venture', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'noir', 'where', 'laughs', 'are', 'depressingly', 'funny', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'delivery', 'actors', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'set', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Wichita', 'time', 'place', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'movie', 'adequately', 'mood', 'Gray', 'little', 'wet', 'populated', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'Wichita', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'why', ""'re"", 'Wichita', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Wichita', 'glorious', 'locale', 'perched', 'strip', 'malls', 'new', 'South', 'cattle', 'ranches', 'old', 'Midwest', 'chirpy', 'docile', 'Christian', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'hellraisin', 'weather', 'own', 'violent', 'streak', 'Tornado', 'Alley', 'summer', 'Ice', 'Alley', 'winter.Charlie', 'Cusack', 'Vic', 'Thornton', 'fully', 'intend', 'leave', 'city', '2.2', 'million', 'stolen', 'mob', 'boss', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'sleet', 'storm', 'escape', 'morning', 'screenplay', 'Academy-Award', 'winner', 'Robert', 'Benton', 'Human', 'Stain', 'most', 'recently', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winner', 'Richard', 'Russo', 'Empire', 'Falls', 'first', 'tour', 'bar', 'life', 'replete', 'heart-of-gold', 'stripper', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'friend', 'Peter', 'Platt', 'who', 'married', 'Charlie', 'ex-wife', 'blooming', 'violence', 'Fargo', 'other', 'pictures', 'Thornton', 'mere', 'presence', 'shadow', 'Vic', 'there', 'point', 'where', 'loyalties', 'are', 'conflicted', 'best.Director', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'content', 'let', 'movie', 'succeed', 'how', 'clearly', 'details', 'dull', 'morbid', 'life', 'strippers', 'painful', 'effort', 'dispose', 'body', 'lonely', 'shame', 'dad', 'buying', 'gas', 'station', 'teddy', 'bears', 'kids', 'Christmas', 'one', 'cop', 'night', 'who', 'just', 'showing', 'up', 'showing', 'up', 'same', 'mocking', 'grin', 'glued', 'lips', 'something', 'poetically', 'bleak', 'Plains', 'winter', 'empty', 'regretful', 'sky-swallows-you-whole', 'feeling', 'whichever', 'tropic', 'Charlie', 'running', 'money', ""'ll"", 'take', 'years', 'weathered', 'Wichita', 'lot', 'dark', 'memories', 'last', 'night', 'there.Cusack', 'nearing', 'age', 'where', 'jowls', 'tired', 'eyes', 'are', 'performances', 'unto', 'here', 'captured', 'weariness', 'muted', 'desire', 'Charlie', 'pretty', 'rotten', 'really', ""n't"", 'look', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'children', 'harmless', 'sack', 'who', 'certain', 'charm', 'certain', 'kind', 'woman', 'Nielsen', 'smoky-voiced', 'stripper', 'subtle', 'ways', 'showing', 'purr', ""n't"", 'girl', 'nature', 'doled', 'out', 'small', 'portions', 'intentions', 'are', 'evident', 'Thornton', 'out', 'space', 'brutal', 'clever', 'Vic', 'too', 'greedy', 'vengeful', 'half', 'Only', 'Quaid', 'playing', 'broad', 'comedy', 'whiffs', 'off', 'cameo', 'was', 'excellent', 'turgid', 'cattle', 'boss', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'straight', 'comedy', 'not', 'caper', 'not', 'Women', 'looking', 'Cusack', 'Saturday', 'night', 'should', 'definitely', 'skip', 'Ice', 'Harvest', 'instead', 'polished', 'whiskey-ordering', 'gentleman', 'corner', 'booth', 'drink', 'how']",N/A
963531,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000DZ7YN8,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 3]","Harold Ramis's ""The Ice Harvest"" wallows in mid-market crime and holiday angst, but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires.  All the ingredients are there, but ultimately the movie lacks spice.  In some movies, it works where all the characters move at a slow pace - ""Nobody's Fool,"" for example.  But a dark comedy needs some pep, and ""The Ice Harvest"" doesn't have it.A lot of that blame falls on the shoulders of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors.  He is at his best when he is riffing one of his intelligent-yet-soulful monologues, like in ""High Fidelity"" and ""Say Anything.""  Here, Cusack's job is to look morose and make the occasional comment - he may speak the fewest lines in any film he's made as a leading man, and that's a shame.  Billy Bob Thornton tries to liven up the movie in his scenes, but the menacing actor is off-screen for huge swaths of time and his absence is felt.  The same with the entertaining Oliver Platt, who plays a drunken buffoon as well as anyone - he's enjoyable on-screen, but when he's not there, we miss him.The bar is set pretty high for holiday-as-setting-for-dysfunction movies. None of the exchanges rise to the visceral heights of the husband-wife spat of ""The Ref,"" for example.  The movie is filled with small-time hoods who all seem hung-over or depressed rather than moved to exercise their savage wits.

At least when watching a live play, the audience has the ability to throw tomatoes and rotten fruit at the performers if they are doing a bad job. ""The Ice Harvest"" is a film so monumentally wrong, that it makes me wish I could throw rotten tomatoes at John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Oliver Platt,  Randy Quaid, the director Harold Ramis, and everyone else involved in this piece of cra*.On Christmas Eve, Charlie Arglist (John Cusack), a lawyer for the Kansas mob, walks into a bank in Witchita Falls and takes $2 million of the mob boss' (Randy Quaid) money. His partner in crime, Vic Cavanaugh (Billy Bob Thornton), a local smut peddler, decides to safeguard the money, raising Charlie's suspicions. Their plan is to wait out the ice storm, drive to Kansas City the next morning, and catch a plane to ""somewhere warm"". Charlie is interested in Renata (Connie Nielsen), the manager of a local strip bar. Renata wants a picture of a City Councilman having sex with one of her strippers, to blackmail him and Charlie knows where the photo is. He figures it would be a great present to her, and help him get into her pants. The mixture of greed, suspicion and weather lead the evening to go horribly wrong.Almost as wrong as the film. But not quite.""The Ice Harvest"" is advertised as a dark, black comedy. Fine. I love this genre of films. Some ads have compared it to ""Bad Santa"", the very underrated hilarious film also starring Billy Bob Thornton. Bologna! ""The Ice Harvest"", directed by Harold Ramis and written by Richard Russo and Robert Benton (an amazing pedigree for such a terrible film), desperately wants to be a cross between ""Fargo"" and ""Blood Simple"". Imagine if you took elements from both of those great films and drained any trace of an inkling of humor out of the work, the result would be ""Harvest"".""Harvest"" might actually work as a straight Noir-ish look at two desperate guys who botch a job. It certainly has all of the elements; a bag of cash, a femme fatale, violence, people with guns and knives, desperation, a double cross, etc. But Ramis is clearly trying to make a dark comedy. And nothing about or in the film is funny. I was sorely tempted to walk out, a few times, but kept hoping that something interesting would happen. My hopes were not met.John Cusack is usually a very dependable actor. He has, in the past, picked projects that played to his strengths, allowing him to create memorable characters, in fun, quirky films. Unfortunately, that ability seems to have been lost. With ""Must Love Dogs"" and ""The Ice Harvest"", Cusack is going through a rough patch that will hopefully end soon. ""Harvest"" makes ""Must Love Dogs"" look like a good film and that says a lot. Throughout ""Harvest"", Cusack's character seems poised to do something funny, or interesting, or unusual. But something always draws him back from this precipice. In one scene, he enters an exclusive restaurant and is asked by the Maitre D' to assist with Pete, played by Oliver Platt. Pete has become drunk in the restaurant bar and loudly proclaims that Charlie is a mob lawyer as soon as he enters. Yet, Cusack merely shakes his head, trying to withdraw from the attention of the crowd. Charlie also keeps running into the same cop, a cop who knows Charlie works for the mob and wants him to ""put in a good word"". Yet, Charlie can't remember his name. Yawn. I know. Pretty feeble.This isn't really a buddy picture between Cusack and Thornton. They share a couple of scenes, but Thornton disappears fairly early in the film. Not that this is a bad thing. Thornton seems to be simply reading his lines. He doesn't get angry, upset, anything throughout. A lackluster performance.Oliver Platt, on the other hand, hams it up as the drunk Pete. He makes crass comments to female bartenders, he yells curse words when interrupting his wife's Christmas Eve dinner with her parents, and just acts silly throughout. If his performance had been toned down, and spread evenly among the three leads, ""Harvest"" might actually have had a laugh or two. Instead, his performance is simply over the top and seems to belong in another film.Randy Quaid makes a brief appearance as the menacing mob boss. His performance is actually pretty good, he seems menacing, scary and violent. It is about the only thing that works. But if ""Harvest"" had been a successful dark comedy, this one goods thing would probably be out of place and it wouldn't work either.All of these problems land at the feet of director Harold Ramis. Ramis has directed and starred in some very funny films including ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Ghostbusters"". But he is clearly off the mark with this project. No one seems to realize they are working on a comedy, including the director. Everything is handled with such gravitas, that a joke or two would seem out of place. Everything is also filmed in a very flat manner. Nothing seems to interest anyone or anything, let alone the director. He lets the camera sit, static, watching the action. No pans, dissolves, nothing. He simply seems bored and the boredom translates to everyone and everything, including the actors.And especially the audience.",1,Don't Bother Thawing This Dog Out,1133740800,"12 5,

963535,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000DZ7YN8,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","Any film with the name of Billy Bob Thornton is worth seeing, and in this American noir ""The Ice Harvest"" he shows what a good actor can do with short screen time allotted to him. Sadly for all his talent and solid cast including John Cusack and Oliver Platt, Harold Ramis-directed film never knows what it really wants to be. Some may say this is a darkly funny noir film, but to me, it is more dark than funny.To most crime novels fans, the story of mob lawyer Charlie (Cusack) stealing money from his powerful employer is nothing new. It is his `partner' Vic (Thornton) who talked him into committing the crime, but you are not sure he is really trustworthy. There is quirky humor surrounding the relations between these characters especially when they have to dispose of something in the car trunk. The process and its results are certainly the best moment of the film thanks to the superb acting from Billy Bob Thornton, who can express the silliness of the whole situation cleverly.You can say the film is not so much about the slow-moving story as the characters it shows, many of whom are not sure what they are doing. Charlie, tired and lonely but still hoping something good in his life, wanders in the street of Wichita on Christmas Eve, sometimes with hopelessly drunk pal Pete (Oliver Platt). Platt is given several memorable lines that are very funny, but considering his talent, his character could have been much more three-dimensional than what he is now.To me the problem of the film is Charlie, hero (or anti-hero) of the film. All through this static story his character seems trying to seek more interesting side in himself, which he simply does not have. Harold Ramis attempts to show the not totally corrupt inside of Charlie with such hackneyed descriptions as his visit to his neglected kids, but these scenes or his meeting with Renata, beautiful and mysterious manager (Connie Nielsen) or Officer Tyler lacks nuances, comic or otherwise.Perhaps we have seen John Cusack playing similar roles too much; or perhaps those `warm-hearted' moments or the changed endings suggest that for all the premise and title, `The Ice Harvest' is not all ice, failing to be completely bleak and icy. Its half-baked touch suggests that Ramis should have made it more wicked and cold-hearted, something Billy Bob Thornton's superb acting implies.",2,"Not Too Cold, Not Too Funny: Needs More Billy Bob Thornton in it",1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,2354,"['film', 'name', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'worth', 'seeing', 'American', 'noir', 'Ice', 'Harvest', 'what', 'good', 'actor', 'can', 'do', 'short', 'screen', 'time', 'allotted', 'Sadly', 'talent', 'solid', 'cast', 'including', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Harold', 'Ramis-directed', 'film', 'never', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'may', 'say', 'darkly', 'funny', 'noir', 'film', 'more', 'dark', 'most', 'crime', 'novels', 'fans', 'story', 'mob', 'lawyer', 'Charlie', 'Cusack', 'stealing', 'money', 'powerful', 'employer', 'nothing', 'new', 'partner', 'Vic', 'Thornton', 'who', 'talked', 'committing', 'crime', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'trustworthy', 'quirky', 'humor', 'surrounding', 'relations', 'characters', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'dispose', 'something', 'car', 'trunk', 'process', 'results', 'are', 'certainly', 'best', 'moment', 'film', 'thanks', 'superb', 'acting', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'who', 'can', 'express', 'silliness', 'whole', 'situation', 'cleverly.You', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'slow-moving', 'story', 'characters', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Charlie', 'tired', 'lonely', 'still', 'hoping', 'something', 'good', 'life', 'wanders', 'street', 'Wichita', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'sometimes', 'hopelessly', 'drunk', 'pal', 'Pete', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Platt', 'given', 'several', 'memorable', 'lines', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'considering', 'talent', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'three-dimensional', 'what', 'now.To', 'problem', 'film', 'Charlie', 'hero', 'anti-hero', 'film', 'static', 'story', 'character', 'trying', 'seek', 'more', 'interesting', 'side', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'show', 'not', 'totally', 'corrupt', 'Charlie', 'such', 'hackneyed', 'descriptions', 'visit', 'neglected', 'kids', 'scenes', 'meeting', 'Renata', 'beautiful', 'mysterious', 'manager', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'Officer', 'Tyler', 'nuances', 'comic', 'have', 'seen', 'John', 'Cusack', 'playing', 'similar', 'roles', 'too', 'much', 'perhaps', 'warm-hearted', 'moments', 'changed', 'endings', 'suggest', 'premise', 'title', 'Ice', 'Harvest', 'not', 'ice', 'failing', 'be', 'completely', 'bleak', 'icy', 'half-baked', 'touch', 'Ramis', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'wicked', 'cold-hearted', 'something', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'superb', 'acting', 'implies']",N/A

This turned out to be a film which surprised me in the most pleasant way with its twists and turns and humor and darkness and just plain good acting.  I feel that John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Platt and the rest of the cast captured their roles perfectly.  The dialogue between the characters was excellent, the suspenseful build-up to the ending was totally engaging, and the direction by Harold Ramis was right on the T.  For me, it was a surprise to say the least because I didn't expect a great deal from this movie.  After I watched it the first time, I immediatedly watched it again.  I've since seen the movie six times during the last four months and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  In fact, I'm going to watch it again right after I finish this review.  The Ice Harvest is definitely not everybody's cup of tea, but for me it's what good movie making is all about.  I certainly recommend this to people who enjoy ""film noir"" movies.

There are always great movies that are lost in the shuffle of holiday releases. Somehow this fine film was overlooked during the holidays. No word of mouth, no buzz and no worthwhile advertising heralded this films arrival. Lucky for you and me we have DVD to save this film from having to be rediscovered in ten or twenty years as one of the funniest film noirs to come out in years and one of the best films of 2005. Charlie Arglist (John Cusack) plots the perfect crime-stealing $2 million from his boss with his partner Vic (Billy Bob Thornton) that goes horribly wrong in this black comedy set on Christmas Eve. Charlie believes that the perfect crime can be committed as long as you have character something that Charlie admits he can't have otherwise why would he be committing this crime?  In the meantime he has to deal with his drunk buddy Pete (Oliver Platt) who has married his ex-wife, a lawyer who is being blackmailed for a photo of his indiscretion and a mob heavy looking for him that Charlie suspects knows all about his planned heist.  Thank God this project came along as I was afraid that one of our generation's great comedic leading men was going to continue to be wasted in projects like ""Must like Dogs"". Ramis manages to capture just the right note desperation, comedy and madness that infect all of these unhappy people on what is supposed to be the warmest night of the year.The chilly surface of the film is captured perfectly here. The cool looking surface of the film mirrors the subject matter. Detail and clarity are exceptional. The 5.1 presentation sounds quite nice but keep in mind that this is a comedy with action not an action comedy. There's a difference-the former focuses primarily on highlighting the dialogue the latter the explosions. The film is available by the way in both a 1.85:1 widescreen and 1.33:1 full screen presentation.The special features are pretty good. ""Cracking the Ice"" features screenwriters Robert Benton (""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Places in the Heart""), Richard Russo (""Nobody's Fool,"" ""Empire Falls"") and novelist Scott Phillips discussing the creation of the story covering it from a unique angle-from the moment that Philips came up with the idea for the novel through the adaptation process for Ramis' film. Benton discovered the book recommended it to Russo. The three writers interview each other. Interestingly both Benton and Russo thought it was perfect for a film while Phillips felt it was not good material for a film despite the fact that he had spent months previously to writing it working on screenplays.""Beneath the Harvest"" features director Ramis, producer Ron Yerxa, actors Connie Nielsen, John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton  discussing what the film is about and what attracted them to the project. Ramis is the most interesting of the group revealing what attracts him to comedies like this (let's just say it's a dark philosophy). Cusack focuses much more on what he liked about playing Charlie his character in the film and what drew him to playing such an unfortunate character. One of my favorite actors Oliver Platt mentions what he feels is the core of the story and what makes it work so well. Interestingly Ramis came to the project AFTER the script was written and admits he went back to read the novel after he read the screenplay. While he loved the screenplay he wanted to see if there was anything the writers had missed (probably the writer in him talking) and found that they had captured it perfectly. It's a solid ""making of"" featurette although nothing spectacular.""Analysis of a Scene"" is pretty self explanatory discussing the difficulty in creating one scene involving the lake. The scene was central and crucial to the success of the film. Ramis and the producers had their team create a mini-lake that they digitally enhanced for the sequence. They all knew though that they needed to have a physical location to sell the scene beyond the digital enhancements. They used melted paraffin to crate the look of the ice in the scene making it easier (and safer to shoot the sequence). We also have a very funny outtake where Thornton plays the scene in his character of Carl from ""Sling Blade"".Ramis provides an amusing blow-by-blow commentary track that's quite amusing. Strangely you can access his commentary tracks via both the special features menu and language but can't turn it off via both menus. The special features are great for this set my only complaint is that you can't turn on and off the commentary track via your remote (something I like to do if I've just watched a scene and want a scene specific commentary) via your remote. Other than that whomever Universal hired to do the special features did a exceptional job overall.A suspenseful black comedy that lost its way into the glut of holiday releases, we're lucky to have home video to appreciate this terrific black comedy. This is truly a gem of a film. Yes, it's cynical and dark but it's funny as hell. Ramis has crafted the antithesis of ""It's a Wonderful Life"". It's a tonic for the dark soul and funny bone regardless of the type of year you watch it.",4,"""Charlie, I hate to say this but you're a nice guy""...""I'm sorry to hear you say
