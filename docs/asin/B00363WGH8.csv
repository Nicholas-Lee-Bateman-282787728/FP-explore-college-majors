1327131,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00363WGH8,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[23, 24]","Most people are not too keen watching old people (seniors) having sex; if you can get past that, then you can relate to an emotional film about seniors in a sexual affair, and the consequences of the disturbing effects of a love affair.  As in many foreign film, there is full frontal nudity, (male and female) and probably the most sexual scenes in a film portrayed by the aging.  Surprisingly we have a rare peek into the sexual aspect of an affair of the aging.Inge is a seamstress in her mid 60s and has been married to Werner for 30 years; he has helped raise her children to adults.  When she repairs 76 year-old Karl's clothes, a tender relationship begins, a sexual relationship.  She is torn between a man who committed his life to her, loved her, her children, and for the man who she gets butterflies in her stomach.  When she is with her new lover Karl, she has guilt on her face; when she is with her husband, Werner, she has emotional and sexual feelings for Karl.  It is like torn between the past and the future, the old and the new.There is no soundtrack in the film, and the only music one hears is from the interspersed clips of Inge at her senior ladies' choir.  The ranges of emotion are plenty here, and with minimal dialogue it is easy to interpret.  It is all in the acting, the expressions, the feelings of love, lust, and the guilt that goes along with an affair.Inge continues the affair and shares the shocking information to her daughter.  From then on, lives of those involved change.  What would one do in a situation like this, how do you expect your partner of 30 years to react, and is this a fling, or will it continue as long as it can?  We are left without a few clues, but it is all in the face, the movements determine the storyline.  Excellent moving performance by Ursula Werner who plays Inge.Director Andreas Dresen, director and writer has done many films in his career, includingWhiskey with VodkaandSummer in Berlin..............Rizzo",5,A sexual affair of the aging,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,1980,"['Most', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'watching', 'old', 'people', 'seniors', 'having', 'sex', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'then', 'can', 'relate', 'emotional', 'film', 'seniors', 'sexual', 'affair', 'consequences', 'disturbing', 'effects', 'love', 'affair', 'many', 'foreign', 'film', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'probably', 'most', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'film', 'portrayed', 'aging', 'Surprisingly', 'have', 'rare', 'peek', 'sexual', 'aspect', 'affair', 'aging.Inge', 'seamstress', 'mid', '60s', 'been', 'married', 'Werner', '30', 'years', 'helped', 'raise', 'children', 'adults', 'When', 'repairs', '76', 'year-old', 'Karl', 'clothes', 'tender', 'relationship', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'torn', 'man', 'who', 'committed', 'life', 'loved', 'children', 'man', 'who', 'butterflies', 'stomach', 'When', 'new', 'lover', 'Karl', 'guilt', 'face', 'when', 'husband', 'Werner', 'emotional', 'sexual', 'feelings', 'Karl', 'torn', 'past', 'future', 'old', 'new.There', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'only', 'music', 'one', 'hears', 'interspersed', 'clips', 'Inge', 'senior', 'ladies', 'choir', 'ranges', 'emotion', 'are', 'plenty', 'here', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'easy', 'interpret', 'acting', 'expressions', 'feelings', 'love', 'lust', 'guilt', 'along', 'affair.Inge', 'affair', 'shares', 'shocking', 'information', 'daughter', 'then', 'lives', 'involved', 'change', 'What', 'would', 'one', 'do', 'situation', 'how', 'do', 'expect', 'partner', '30', 'years', 'react', 'fling', 'will', 'continue', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'are', 'left', 'few', 'clues', 'face', 'movements', 'determine', 'storyline', 'Excellent', 'moving', 'performance', 'Ursula', 'Werner', 'who', 'Inge.Director', 'Andreas', 'Dresen', 'director', 'writer', 'done', 'many', 'films', 'career', 'includingWhiskey', 'VodkaandSummer', 'Berlin', '..Rizzo']",N/A
1327132,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00363WGH8,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","Affairs are common fodder for cinema these days, or really any day considering that they have served as the basis for films stretching all the way back to the 30's.  Yes, the world is very interested in watching other people's misery.What are NOT common are films regarding the affairs of senior citizens.Yes, `Cloud 9' focuses on a rather explicit affair that forms between a married woman in her 60's and an older bachelor (in his 70's).  Be forewarned, this film is very explicit and contains numerous scenes of sex and nudity with these elderly actors.  But, once you get past whatever discomfort may be found in watching these acts unfold (and you'd be lying if you tried to pretend that it there wasn't a sense of discomfort) you are left with a pretty moving film.  I won't say that it works entirely, because it doesn't, but as a whole the film is touching and it helps to shine a light on an area of relationships that we don't often consider.  As one ages, people just assume that their sparks die and they remain `friends' in their marital bond, but that can't sustain a living breathing relationship.  `Cloud 9' tries to uncover the reason for which an elderly woman may decide to up and leave her husband of thirty plus years.I won't lie, the explicit nature of some scenes felt a little unnecessary.  True, if they were a forty something attractive couple I probably wouldn't have that quibble, but to deny it's there would be foolish.  But, a bigger note of concern comes in the form of the development of relationships.  There is the obvious, which is that Inge no longer feels a connection to Werner but is completely head of heals for Karl.  Outside of that obviousness though, there isn't much built on the relationships as a whole.  There is very little dialog but mostly sequences of silence that float between characters and we are left to watch Inge internally debate her situation.  In that regard, actress Ursela Werner is extraordinary.  She flawlessly handles the internal complexity of guilt and entitlement.  Sadly though, I didn't feel that the actual core of the film was fully embodied.  Relationship films need dialog to help flesh out the root feelings, and that is mostly ignored here.Still, `Cloud 9' does leave an impression and is a film I recommend for the sheer fact that it challenges the audience to see things from an angle they may not have believed existed.",3,Old people doing it...,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,2402,"['Affairs', 'are', 'common', 'fodder', 'cinema', 'days', 'really', 'day', 'considering', 'have', 'served', 'basis', 'films', 'stretching', 'way', 'back', '30', 'Yes', 'world', 'very', 'interested', 'watching', 'other', 'people', 'misery.What', 'are', 'NOT', 'common', 'are', 'films', 'regarding', 'affairs', 'senior', 'citizens.Yes', 'Cloud', '9', 'focuses', 'rather', 'explicit', 'affair', 'married', 'woman', '60', 'older', 'bachelor', '70', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'film', 'very', 'explicit', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'sex', 'nudity', 'elderly', 'actors', 'once', 'get', 'past', 'discomfort', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'watching', 'acts', 'unfold', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'tried', 'pretend', 'was', ""n't"", 'sense', 'discomfort', 'are', 'left', 'pretty', 'moving', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'entirely', ""n't"", 'whole', 'film', 'touching', 'shine', 'light', 'area', 'relationships', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'consider', 'one', 'people', 'just', 'assume', 'sparks', 'die', 'remain', 'friends', 'marital', 'bond', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'living', 'breathing', 'relationship', 'Cloud', '9', 'tries', 'uncover', 'reason', 'elderly', 'woman', 'may', 'decide', 'up', 'leave', 'husband', 'thirty', 'years.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'explicit', 'nature', 'scenes', 'felt', 'little', 'unnecessary', 'True', 'were', 'forty', 'something', 'attractive', 'couple', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'quibble', 'deny', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'bigger', 'note', 'concern', 'form', 'development', 'relationships', 'obvious', 'Inge', 'no', 'longer', 'feels', 'connection', 'Werner', 'completely', 'head', 'heals', 'Karl', 'Outside', 'obviousness', ""n't"", 'much', 'built', 'relationships', 'whole', 'very', 'little', 'dialog', 'mostly', 'sequences', 'silence', 'float', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'watch', 'Inge', 'internally', 'debate', 'situation', 'regard', 'actress', 'Ursela', 'Werner', 'extraordinary', 'flawlessly', 'internal', 'complexity', 'guilt', 'entitlement', 'Sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'actual', 'core', 'film', 'was', 'fully', 'embodied', 'Relationship', 'films', 'need', 'dialog', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'root', 'feelings', 'mostly', 'ignored', 'here.Still', 'Cloud', '9', 'leave', 'impression', 'film', 'recommend', 'sheer', 'fact', 'audience', 'see', 'things', 'angle', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'believed', 'existed']",N/A
