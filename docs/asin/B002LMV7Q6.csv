There's a lot of loud music, rapid fire editing, maps and time markers popping up on screen every six minutes, but that's about it.  Take away these attempts by director Scott to make it APPEAR as though a lot of action is taking place, and you're really left with a movie about some guys sitting in a subway.The main one of those guys is John Travolta, in another performance so bad that I'm actually starting to think he's taken an oath to suck.  Never has a movie ""villian"" been so poorly written and acted as Travolta's ""Ryder"" in this film.  The dialogue he has to deliver is awful to begin with, but Travolta seemed determined to hammer this point home.

Despite that, I'm not averse to remakes, especially when you have a cast that includes John Travolta, Denzel Washington and James Gandolfini. How any of these 3 fine actors attached their names to this remake is beyond me. Travolta particularly has taken on choice rolls since his rebirth after ""Pulp Fiction."" Not all have been of that caliber. But they've at least been inspired roles. His manic role in this movie, a Tony Scott bastardization of the original, is such a disappointment. There's nothing to his performance I haven't seen before, or better. And I rarely say that about Travolta any more. Denzel's role is a snooze. And Gandolfini's role is paper thin for his capability. The Scott direction in this movie is pathetic. It tries to do with gratuitous action and dialogue exchanges what the original does effortlessly with a solid script and seasoned actors to deliver the goods (albeit in a bit dated version.) There was little suspense in a movie that had it from the start with the original. I hope this isn't an indication that Travolta and Gandolfini are reaching for a paycheck alone these days. This movie has so many like it out there, that I could see why someone reached for the rights to remake it after seeing the original story and thinking in contemporary terms-updating in technology and in general, more action given contemporary standards, etc. It's an easy template to fit your vision into today.

1276887,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002LMV7Q6,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[2, 2]","Director Tony Scott's latest movie, a remake of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 (2009), was one of my latest DVD rentals from Redbox.  The movie had two things going for it in my mind to get me to watch it: Tony Scott and Denzel Washington...both of whom I typically love.  But the magic just wasn't there for either of them on this flick.  The movie was great looking as always for Tony Scott movies and very ""techie"" as Tony Scott movies tend to always be.  And Denzel Washington's acting was good as always.  I think it was purely the story and the script that just didn't grab me.  Now I admit that I am not much of John Travolta fan either.  About the only movie of his I like is Phenomenon (1996)...it's the exception to an otherwise slate of movies that he has starred in that just don't do it for me...including Pulp Fiction (sorry to those I offend!).  I feel the same way about Nicholas Cage...very few of his movies I like.  I don't know what it is about the two of them, but I just don't connect with them.  It might be their egos or personalities.  Or the characters they typically choose to play.But back to The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3...the first act of the movie was good.  It built-up my interest and kept me involved in the picture.  But somewhere in the middle act I got bored and found the story to be predictable.  And funny enough, I've never seen or studied the original 1974 movie, so it wasn't that.  Or maybe it was that.  Maybe the problem was that essentially this was a 35 year old story that was updated in terms of look and feel, but lacked the upgrade in character development and story.  The thing about great movies I think is that they are both timeless and of their time.  It's a paradox really...like everything in life.  Sometimes I like the remake better and sometimes I like the original better.  And sometimes both.  For me its almost always the same criteria for a movie:  Do I like it?  Do I like the characters?  Do I like the actors and director's vision/style? Do I like the look/production design or music? Can I personally relate to the story or any of the charcters?  There's got to be something that I really grab on to.  And The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 just didn't have that for me.I know that a lot of my movie reviews don't really say much about the actually movie but say more about how I feel about the movie.  That's my approach to movies.  It's an experience for me that I share with you and then you decide if you want to have the experience based on my experience.  Isn't that how we all approach movies?  To me, a movie is like eating something.  You can talk in great detail about it and describe it to someone and that may entice them to try it out...but at the end of the day, you have to actually EAT something in order to truly experience it and make a decision on whether or not you like it or not.If you want a better Tony Scott/Denzel Washington movie to watch, I suggest Deja Vu (2006).  And I also love Enemy of the State (1998), Crimson Tide (1995), Days of Thunder (1990), Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) and of course his classic movie, Top Gun (1986).  I look forward to whatever Tony has in store next.

It is also a daunting idea to remake a movie that was well-made in its first treatment. Any way you look at it, it can be a trap for any party involved. That is precisely the case with ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" a film that originally came out in 1974. For this reason, purposely ignoring the first version, I will review the 2009 film. That said, I found this new installment exciting and gripping, which is what entertainment is all about.Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) is a subway dispatcher who works in the control center of New City's midtown subway system. He is having a good day, that is, until he notices irregular activities in the traffic board. He receives a phone call by an individual who says, ""This is the man who is going to rock this city. This is the man who is going to give the city a run for its money."" We then learn that the man is Ryder (John Travolta), and that he has kidnapped a train car from the Pelham 123 route. Ryder and his assistants, turns out, are merciless killers that do not hesitate to pull the trigger to get what they want; in this case, they are asking for a ten million dollar ransom. So, as you can expect, this creates a difficult and volatile situation. It doesn't help that Garber also has his own issues that affect the resolution of the conflict, which, in way, also becomes a fight for his life.As any movie directed by Tony Scott (Spy Game, Domino, D&eacute;j&agrave; vu), ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" is flashy and fast, with trendy use of technology and cinematography, which is precisely one of the differences between the 1974 version from the 2009 one - and that's where my comparison begins and ends. It is action-packed and will keep you glued to your seat until the very end. The DVD also features commentaries by the director, writer Brian Helgeland and producer Todd Black; making-of documentary; New York underground documentary; and more.

Namely, the charisma of its two stars: Denzel Washington and John Travolta.  Denzel is always good and immensely watchable.  Travolta is perhaps at his most disgusting best.  What surprised me most was the relationship between these two characters.  Travolta's bad guy seems almost infatuated with Denzel's character, adding that extra unnerving edge as they go about trying to outwit each other.  For action fans, there are several edge-of-your-seat scenes that will keep you watching.The one major drawback for me in this movie was its incessant use of obscenities.  I'm not sure what the director and writer were trying to prove by including so much foul language; for me it was a big distraction.  Instead of staying strictly involved in the story, I found myself anticipating when the next character was going to mouth a four-letter word.  Unfortunately, one never has to wait very long.Remakes are infamous for not being as good as the original and this one, sadly, is no exception.

1276892,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002LMV7Q6,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","Yes, ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" works as an action film. But what interested me more was the dynamic between subway dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) and a criminal mastermind who calls himself Ryder (John Travolta). They share such fascinating scenes that I'm disappointed there weren't more of them. It's a classic psychological scenario: Ryder, who hijacks a New York City subway train and holds passengers hostage, begins communicating with Garber over the intercom and comes to identify with him. Would he consider Garber a friend? Possibly, although I think a more accurate way of putting it is that he considers Garber as an equal, someone who knows just how terrible the city of New York can be. To elaborate would give too much away, but I will say that Garber has his own problems to deal with.Tony Scott's remake of the 1974 film starring Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw (itself based on the novel by John Godey) isn't at pains to transcend its genre, and it definitely steers clear of the subtleties that make psychological thrillers appealing. Still, it achieves everything it wanted to achieve. Much of its success, of course, is the result of the performances by Washington and Travolta; despite the fact that they aren't physically seen together for most of the film, they still share natural onscreen chemistry, the back and forth conversations over the intercom flowing with seemingly no effort. Travolta in particular is especially good, effectively conveying his character's irrational state of mind. Ryder is a psychopath, but he's not without some depth--one can tell that his rage has been building for quite some time, quite possibly for very good reasons.Whereas the original film was focused on satirically portraying the people of New York reacting to an extraordinary situation, this new film focuses more on the situation itself, and it plays up the psychological drama convincingly. What Ryder and Garber share is much more personal, which is to say that it's not merely about trying to stop the bad guy. It's about trying to understand the bad guy, getting to the heart of why he's doing what he's doing. There are some interesting things to consider, most notably the fact that he continuously monitors the state of the stock market on a laptop as he sits in the driver's compartment. This most certainly has something to do with his demands: Garber must contact the Mayor of New York and have $10 million delivered in exactly one hour. Should the delivery be late, Ryder will execute a hostage for every additional minute.There are other nicely developed characters. For one, there's Camonetti (John Turturro), a professional hostage negotiator who guides Garber as he attempt to placate Ryder. Camonetti is level-headed and calm, a man who has clearly been through tough situations before. He's well aware of the urgency, but he never loses himself to panic, and he's capable of thinking things through, even when Ryder showers him with a litany of ethnic slurs. At the same time, he's well aware that time is running out for the hostages, as is the NYPD, who have the unfortunate responsibility of collecting Ryder's money and getting it to the subway.There's also Garber's wife, Therese (Aunjanue Ellis). While not given very much screen time, her brief phone conversations with her husband suggest fascinating things about their relationship. Why, for instance, would she ask him to pick up a gallon of milk on the way home from delivering the money to Ryder? Better yet, why would Garber immediately start talking about only getting a quart? Do they genuinely believe that everything will be all right, or is it just their way to distract themselves so as not to panic? I would imagine it's a little bit of both.And then there's the Mayor of New York (James Gandolfini). I was pleasantly surprised by him. He's introduced as yet another political stereotype--an unpopular man with no connection to the people in the middle of a scandal. But then comes his final scene with Garber, and while I won't reveal what he says, I will say that it makes him seem much more convincing as a real person. This didn't quite apply to the original version of ""Pelham,"" which depicted the Mayor, played by Lee Wallace, as an opportunistic phony. Maybe it helped that Gandolfini's take on this character didn't involve him being sick with the flu.All in all, ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" is adequate entertainment, which is to say that it's everything it wants to be and no more. It delivers as a tense action picture, but it achieves more with the psychological components, helped immensely by the onscreen chemistry between Washington and Travolta. In spite of the less-than-original plot, they were able to convince me that they were two men on opposite sides of the law in a desperate situation. Travolta is especially effective, not a clone of the cold and calculating Mr. Blue from the original ""Pelham"" but rather an enhancement--an intense man with a grudge against the city of New York. You believe that he's capable of anything, including murder. Believing in a character is always the hallmark of a decent movie.",4,Next Stop: A Hostage Situation,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,5156,"['Yes', 'Taking', 'Pelham', '1', '2', '3', 'works', 'action',

If the idea was to improve on the original (tough proposition) it is not done. Original performances (the chilling Shaw and Elizondo, the disheveled Matthau, the milketoast Balsam) were better or better developed than here (with the exceptions of Gandolfini's and Turturro's characters -in particular the latter, which seems multidimensional and appropriately underplayed).Judging from the way Travolta overplays his character -which, unlike Shaw's, scares nobody- they could have hired Jim Carrey instead.*Spoiler Alert* The insertion of subplots (Garber is under suspicion of bribery, Ryder is a Wall Street investor) add very little to the basic premise of Godey's book (which is so good that it keeps the film running in itself) nor change the outcome in any meaningful way.A great chance of doing something with the view of the scene provided by a hidden web connected laptop is wasted.The original ending is much better, symbolically shocking (pun intended)  and, at the very end, funny. Here, why Garber -a head of a family- risks his life and runs tenaciously after Ryder, who is escaping anyway? He owes the city exactly what?Frantic editing does not necessarily add suspense to a film, so Scott decides to get some by any means: at the end Garber is forced to fire because the approaching policemen are apparently running on a treadmill. *-*In a nutshell: Scott spent a lot more money than Sargent (the original director) to do somehow worse.If you missed the original you will enjoy this.

1276895,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002LMV7Q6,Craig Whittle,"[0, 0]","THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123STARRING: Denzel Washington, John Travolta, Luis Guzman, John Turturro and James GandolfiniWRITTEN BY: Brian Helgeland; based on the novel by John GodeyDIRECTED BY: Tony ScottRated: RGenre: Action / ThrillerRelease Date: 12 June 2009My two favorite actors in Hollywood are Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. While I did like The Taking of Pelham 123, I'm surprised Denzel took the job. Personally, I think this role was a little beneath him; but he just made the film that much better by being a part of it.John Travolta is an extraordinary actor who makes really good movies and really bad ones. Without Denzel in the corner with him, this more than likely would have been a bad one.The film is very entertaining and has its moments; but having these two in the leads, (let alone the phenomenal directing of Tony Scott), it should have been flawless.Travolta gets the film going right away. He plays Ryder; a tough felon who's fed up with the harsh ways of his city. He explodes onto the screen by pulling a gun on a woman operating a train, giving her a command and promising to her,""Do it, or I'll kill you."" Powerful stuff.Travolta plays Ryder so well that you don't know whether to like him or fear him. One minute you are laughing with him and the next you are baffled and taken aback by his very limited but amusing vocabulary. He has a catch phrase he must say at least half a dozen times in the film with the initials M.F. Some will find offensive and obnoxious but I found it fit his character quite nicely.He is one of the few actors out there who can play a villain every bit as well as he can a hero, if not better. If you need proof check out Face/off; you get both performances in the same film.Ryder and a group of his personal thugs take a subway train called Pelham 123, hostage on a busy morning in New York. Garber (Denzel Washington) is the poor soul on the other end of the mike who takes his ransom demands. Garber works for the city in a subway trafficking control center downtown.Ryder demands ten million dollars and one cent from the city of New York in exchange for the hostages. I won't tell you what the one cent is for but I promise you, it stems from brilliant writing.Soon the Feds and the Mayor get involved. James Gandolfini plays the Mayor and John Turturro plays the lead FBI agent. I'm surprised both of these two signed on for the film as well. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie; it just doesn't seem to be quite as good as you would expect it to be with all of the Hollywood big shots involved. I didn't feel that these two characters were deserving of such great actors to portray them. Neither of them had much of an ark and their dialogue was mediocre. But I suppose Gandolfini and Turturro and everyone else on board knew that Denzel and Travolta would be the main attractions in the film, so it's forgivable.Denzel does a knock out job of playing an everyday guy here. He is talked down to by several characters in the film to include his boss who we want to kick in the head and especially by Ryder. His character doesn't comeback with big-screen one liners. He reacts in a much more civilized way as he tries to de-escalate the situation continuously. Towards the end of the film, he gets his hands on a gun and you buy that he probably never held one before; despite the fact that we've seen him bearing arms in countless films.I particularly enjoyed the part of the film where Ryder gets Garber to disclose something personal. The two of them are not even in the scene together physically but their acting seal both sets together and we forget their distance throughout the course of the film.The film is oozing with Tony Scott's classic trademark cinematography and well choreographed action sequences. It moves at a very steady pace to its highly anticipated climax.The end of the film was terrific. We get exactly what we want and we aren't cheated out of closure or believability. What makes The Taking of Pelham 123 better than the other action flicks of the summer of 2009, is that it relies on the good performances of it's actors to keep the story afloat rather than the action. Any film can have well put together action scenes but when you believe the characters that are thrown into the middle of that action and you can identify with them, that's what makes a movie!I liked the physical characteristics that each of these great talents added to their movie people.

1276898,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B002LMV7Q6,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[0, 0]","ok, so I got to admit it; I love the 1974 original with the inimitable Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw, with Hector Elizondo in the Latino roleThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three. Yes, I hate myself for loving it, and I am coming out about it. It is a masterpiece of comedy and suspense, a guilty pleasure.But, you know, the mighty Denzel Washington (of the unusual, for him,Training Day (Snap Case), the marvelous and unmissableMalcolm X [Blu-ray], the intelligentAntwone Fisher (Widescreen Edition), the earlyThe Mighty Quinn, all high quality performances) here makes a mighty fine stand-in for Mr. Matthau. Where this falls down is killing the comedy and upping the disaster drama. A few too many car chases and too much gunfire.I mean, some of the plot devices here are a bit too questionable. Would a top notch cop sniper truly lay down in a NEW YORK subway line, (in A NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY LINE!!! OMG! already) without first having stuffed his pants legs well inside his boots, and tied that down tightly? I mean these guys live with the pants legs INSIDE their boots, and sleep with their pants legs tied tightly INSIDE their boots. All of a sudden they got pants legs loosely OUTSIDE their boots? Huh? You with me on this? No spoiler here, but come one . . . Just to move things along? I mean, just asking for trouble, ok?and would the New York subway system really send someone with no actual coursework or licensing as a civil engineer, but only a few years running a train, out to assess train systems in Canada and Japan, and not in the USA? Would the Japanese really need to BRIBE that guy with a rather slim bribe?Sorry, but I just ain't buying it. If you do, hey, I got a bridge for sale, you know? A little too much suspension of disbelief going on here. Give me a break. Respect my intelligence, ok? No one else does . . .And Travolta struggling to be convincing OVER THE TOP? Johnny raging, just can't do it . . .And when he SHOULD have been raging, the script again, just ain't there. I mean after the sniping, and he goes back to shoot the kid, and of course kills the black man instead, he should have had some lines to set us up, and does not.Blame it on the script.And whenever a nameless Black man shows up in a movie and gets a few lines and face time, you just KNOW he is going to get killed. I mean, giving the main role to Denzel was already a risk . . .But this real black man is the finest actor in the film aside from Denzel. He gets the job done, anonymously, with just a look. He should have won the Oscar for this performance, He does a truly effective, understated performance, with just a look, at the widow across the train from him, just one look, and he delivers the goods. I am serious here. He does a truly masterful job, with just one silent look, telling the whole story of all of their lives, with one look, doing far more acting than Travolta with ALL of his furious carpet chewing. Give this black man a prize. He is real here as no other actor is, but Denzel and his wife. And James Gandolfini. Papa Soprano as Mayor of New York City. Brilliant!I must admit, I do go for the way Denzel's supervisor undercuts him every chance, including sending him home. This, too, is REAL.but like, with us getting established that travolta has one internet browser window watching the real time stock returns like some day trader, and got a few other windows open, why doesn't he IMMEDIATELY know there is a videocam in the car?HUH?!So there is a whole lot to love in this film, but the script is weak where it should be refined, and the car chase stuff, and the bullets flying, and Travolta . . .Not enough to scare off the looming and marvelous ghost of Matthau.Three stars.Sorry, Denzel, despite your magnificent work here and everywhere.You make this not totally bad.",2,the great ghost of Walter Matthau walks this like Hamlet's ghost,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,3804,"['ok', 'got', 'admit', 'love', '1974', 'original', 'inimitable', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Latino', 'roleThe', 'Taking', 'Pelham', 'One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Yes', 'hate', 'loving', 'am', 'coming', 'out', 'masterpiece', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'guilty', 'pleasure.But', 'know', 'mighty', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'unusual', 'Training', 'Day', 'Snap', 'Case', 'marvelous', 'unmissableMalcolm', 'X', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'intelligentAntwone', 'Fisher', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'earlyThe', 'Mighty', 'Quinn', 'high', 'quality', 'performances', 'here', 'mighty', 'fine', 'stand-in', 'Mr.', 'Matthau', 'Where', 'down', 'killing', 'comedy', 'upping', 'disaster', 'drama', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'car', 'chases', 'too', 'much', 'gunfire.I', 'mean', 'plot', 'devices', 'here', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'questionable', 'Would', 'top', 'notch', 'cop', 'sniper', 'truly', 'lay', 'down', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'subway', 'line', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'CITY', 'SUBWAY', 'LINE', 'OMG', 'already', 'first', 'having', 'stuffed', 'pants', 'legs', 'well', 'boots', 'tied', 'down', 'tightly', 'mean', 'guys', 'live', 'pants', 'legs', 'INSIDE', 'boots', 'sleep', 'pants', 'legs', 'tied', 'tightly', 'INSIDE', 'boots', 'sudden', 'got', 'pants', 'legs', 'loosely', 'OUTSIDE', 'boots', 'Huh', 'spoiler', 'here', 'come', 'one', 'Just', 'move', 'things', 'mean', 'just', 'asking', 'trouble', 'ok', 'would', 'New', 'York', 'subway', 'system', 'really', 'send', 'someone', 'actual', 'coursework', 'licensing', 'civil', 'engineer', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'running', 'train', 'assess', 'train', 'systems', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'not', 'USA', 'Would', 'Japanese', 'really', 'need', 'BRIBE', 'guy', 'rather', 'slim', 'bribe', 'Sorry', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'buying', 'do', 'hey', 'got', 'bridge', 'sale', 'know', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'going', 'here', 'Give', 'break', 'Respect', 'intelligence', 'ok', 'one', 'else', '.And', 'Travolta', 'struggling', 'be', 'convincing', 'THE', 'TOP', 'Johnny', 'raging', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', '.And', 'when', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'raging', 'script', 'again', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'there', 'mean', 'sniping', 'back', 'shoot', 'kid', 'course', 'black', 'man', 'instead', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'lines', 'set', 'up', 'not.Blame', 'script.And', 'whenever', 'nameless', 'Black', 'man', 'up', 'movie', 'few', 'lines', 'face', 'time', 'just', 'KNOW', 'going', 'get', 'killed', 'mean', 'giving', 'main', 'role', 'Denzel', 'was', 'already', 'risk', '.But', 'real', 'black', 'man', 'finest', 'actor', 'film', 'aside', 'Denzel', 'job', 'done', 'anonymously', 'just', 'look', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'truly', 'effective', 'understated', 'performance', 'just', 'look', 'widow', 'train', 'just', 'one', 'look', 'goods', 'am', 'serious', 'here', 'truly', 'masterful', 'job', 'just', 'one', 'silent', 'look', 'telling', 'whole', 'story', 'lives', 'one', 'look', 'doing', 'far', 'more', 'acting', 'Travolta', 'ALL', 'furious', 'carpet', 'chewing', 'Give', 'black', 'man', 'prize', 'real', 'here', 'other', 'actor', 'Denzel', 'wife', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Papa', 'Soprano', 'Mayor', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Brilliant', 'must', 'admit', 'do', 'go', 'way', 'Denzel', 'supervisor', 'chance', 'including', 'sending', 'home', 'too', 'REAL.but', 'getting', 'established', 'travolta', 'one', 'internet', 'browser', 'window', 'watching', 'real', 'time', 'stock', 'returns', 'day', 'trader', 'got', 'few', 'other', 'windows', 'open', 'why', ""n't"", 'IMMEDIATELY', 'know', 'videocam', 'car', 'HUH', 'whole', 'lot', 'love', 'film', 'script', 'weak', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'refined', 'car', 'chase', 'stuff', 'bullets', 'flying', 'Travolta', 'enough', 'scare', 'off', 'looming', 'marvelous', 'ghost', 'Matthau.Three', 'stars.Sorry', 'Denzel', 'magnificent', 'work', 'here', 'everywhere.You', 'make', 'not', 'totally', 'bad']",N/A

The original was a nifty little movie that seemed to be on one of the UHF channels every weekend while growing up. I enjoyed the original film, and didn't really see a need to re-make (or is that re-imagine now??) the 70's classic.Well I finally happened to catch the remade ""Pelham"" the other night, and have to say it wasn't too bad...I expected much worse. The basic storyline remains the same, a group of thieves take over a subway car and several hostages in New York city. John Travolta plays ""Rider"" the leader of the gang, and like the original he contacts the subway command center and ends up forming a relationship with a dispatcher played by Denzel Washington.I think several things hurt this remake....first and foremost if John Travolta. His performance here makes his acting in ""Battlefield Earth"" look subtle. Over the top and hamming it up kind of kills any tension that is created. The director makes some odd choices as well, thowing in a ""24"" like clock at times and at times the film will jarring jump into slo-mo for no reason, then back to normal, then back to slo-mo. And fans of the original will hate the ending of this remake.With that said, if you happen to catch this on cable or see it on Netflix (and if you're not familiar with the original), then give it a shot.

One is of the two Internet youngsters declaring their love for each other, he huddling on the floor in the train at his computer, his computer still miraculously functioning despite earlier having been thrown down there and despite the armed hijackers hovering about, just as the train car is hurtling toward another crisis.  Another is of the execrably inane dialogue between Denzel and his wife over a gallon of milk when Denzel should be making all haste to board the helicopter to get where he has to be to meet the bad guys' demands.  Both sequences struck me as utterly sophomoric and interruptive of the dramatic flow.There is a line in the film critical of biggies' having their heads up anatomical dark places.

1276907,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B002LMV7Q6,Erik North,"[2, 2]","Even more so than sequels, remakes of older films have their own build-in pratfalls.  The pratfalls are just a lot more noticeable if the original film was a classic or extremely well regarded.Such are the complications that faced director Tony Scott (MAN ON FIRE; TOP GUN) and screenwriter Brian Helgeland as they took on their remake of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1-2-3, which had already made for an incredibly suspenseful film back in 1974 under the hands of experienced journeyman director Joseph Sargent.  Based on John Godey's 1973 novel, that film's story of a New York City subway hijacking in which eighteen people were threatened with violent execution at the hands of heavily armed gunmen if a million-dollar ransom wasn't paid in exactly one hour had not only the particular NYC grit of the mid-1970s, but also a fair bit of jet-black comedy as well, ratcheting up the tension even more.  With audience attention spans shrunk considerably in the ensuing thirty-five years, not to mention the expectations of car crashes and explosions, Scott and Helgeland not surprisingly fall somewhat short by substituting subtlety with sound and fury; headache-inducing freeze frame and montage gimmickry; rap and heavy metal on the soundtrack; and far more crude language and bloodshed than is really necessary.Still, there have been remakes that have been far worse than this one; and at least, Scott had the good sense of placing Denzel Washington in the role essayed by Walter Matthau in the original; here, he is a transit official with a slightly shady past (and whereas he was named Zachary Garber in the original, as a favor to the great actor who played Garber in '74, in 2009 he's named Walter Garber).  Times being different, the ransom is now up to $10 million, but the idea of making NYC deliver the money in one hour wisely remains the same, giving the remake the same HIGH NOON-style level of tension that informed the 1974 original.  Veteran New York-based actors John Turturro (as a hostage negotiator) and James Gandolfini (as the NYC mayor) also do good supporting turns, trying to help Washington's cool, calm, collected transit official.Where I felt the film went slightly askew, however, was in a decision typical of many Hollywood directors these days with respect to actors who play villains--allowing them to go so far overboard early on that there's more ham in their performances than there is in any Hormel factory.  And this is what Scott does with John Travolta; he allows the actor to play the lead hijacker John Ryder with far too much zeal and insanity to be anything other than a typical Hollywood nut job, this in total contrast to Robert Shaw in the original film, where the late, great British actor portrayed Ryder with a certain low-key viciousness and a clipped delivery.  Indeed, what the film misses the most is the witty over-the-radio repartee between Matthau and Shaw that was present in the original.  Both Helgeland and Scott missed the boat on that one.And yet, despite all the bloodshed, profanity, and headache-inducing sound and fury thrown at the viewer, it is really the plot itself that makes this film work as well as it does; and it is fortunate that, thanks to Washington's presence, Scott isn't allowed to completely trash that.  This PELHAM stops a couple of stations short of the masterpiece status accorded to the original, but one could do much worse in terms of classic films that 21st century Hollywood has somehow decided need a reworking.",4,"Short Of The 1974 Original, But I've Seen Much Worse",1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,3498,"['Even', 'more', 'so', 'sequels', 'remakes', 'older', 'films', 'have', 'own', 'build-in', 'pratfalls', 'pratfalls', 'are', 'just', 'lot', 'more', 'noticeable', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'classic', 'extremely', 'well', 'regarded.Such', 'are', 'complications', 'faced', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'MAN', 'ON', 'FIRE', 'TOP', 'GUN', 'screenwriter', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'took', 'remake', 'THE', 'TAKING', 'OF', 'PELHAM', '1-2-3', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'incredibly', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'back', '1974', 'hands', 'experienced', 'journeyman', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'Based', 'John', 'Godey', '1973', 'novel', 'film', 'story', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'subway', 'hijacking', 'eighteen', 'people', 'were', 'threatened', 'violent', 'execution', 'hands', 'heavily', 'armed', 'gunmen', 'million-dollar', 'ransom', 'was', ""n't"", 'paid', 'exactly', 'one', 'hour', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'particular', 'NYC', 'grit', 'mid-1970s', 'also', 'fair', 'bit', 'jet-black', 'comedy', 'well', 'ratcheting', 'up', 'tension', 'even', 'more', 'audience', 'attention', 'shrunk', 'considerably', 'ensuing', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'not', 'mention', 'expectations', 'car', 'crashes', 'explosions', 'Scott', 'Helgeland', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'fall', 'somewhat', 'short', 'substituting', 'subtlety', 'sound', 'fury', 'headache-inducing', 'freeze', 'frame', 'montage', 'gimmickry', 'rap', 'heavy', 'metal', 'soundtrack', 'far', 'more', 'crude', 'language', 'bloodshed', 'really', 'necessary.Still', 'have', 'been', 'remakes', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'worse', 'one', 'least', 'Scott', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'placing', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'role', 'essayed', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'original', 'here', 'transit', 'official', 'slightly', 'shady', 'past', 'was', 'named', 'Zachary', 'Garber', 'original', 'favor', 'great', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Garber', ""'74"", '2009', 'named', 'Walter', 'Garber', 'Times', 'being', 'different', 'ransom', 'now', 'up', '10', 'million', 'idea', 'making', 'NYC', 'deliver', 'money', 'one', 'hour', 'wisely', 'same', 'giving', 'remake', 'same', 'HIGH', 'NOON-style', 'level', 'tension', 'informed', '1974', 'original', 'Veteran', 'New', 'York-based', 'actors', 'John', 'Turturro', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'NYC', 'mayor', 'also', 'do', 'good', 'supporting', 'turns', 'trying', 'help', 'Washington', 'cool', 'calm', 'collected', 'transit', 'official.Where', 'felt', 'film', 'went', 'slightly', 'askew', 'however', 'was', 'decision', 'typical', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'days', 'respect', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'villains', 'allowing', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'overboard', 'early', 'more', 'ham', 'performances', 'Hormel', 'factory', 'what', 'Scott', 'John', 'Travolta', 'actor', 'play', 'lead', 'hijacker', 'John', 'Ryder', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'zeal', 'insanity', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'nut', 'job', 'total', 'contrast', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'original', 'film', 'where', 'late', 'great', 'British', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'Ryder', 'certain', 'low-key', 'viciousness', 'clipped', 'delivery', 'Indeed', 'what', 'film', 'most', 'witty', 'over-the-radio', 'repartee', 'Matthau', 'Shaw', 'was', 'present', 'original', 'Helgeland', 'Scott', 'missed', 'boat', 'one.And', 'yet', 'bloodshed', 'profanity', 'headache-inducing', 'sound', 'fury', 'thrown', 'viewer', 'really', 'plot', 'film', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'fortunate', 'thanks', 'Washington', 'presence', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'completely', 'trash', 'PELHAM', 'couple', 'stations', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'status', 'accorded', 'original', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'terms', 'classic', 'films', '21st', 'century', 'Hollywood', 'somehow', 'decided', 'need', 'reworking']",N/A

For some viewers this ruins the gold standard of the original film: for this viewer it heightens the mass, faceless, rapidly paced anonymity of life on the New York subways and makes the  pace of the story almost breathless.  This time around Denzel Washington is the demoted dispatcher who must deal directly with the insane John Travolta and his gang of hostage takers demanding $10,000,000.01 to avoid killing the isolated carload of people on the Pelham 123 train.  The police of course get involved under the guidance of the chief (played with appropriate dignity by John Turturro) who in turn must involve the Mayor of New York, again well enacted by James Gandolfini.  The story may be obvious but the final twists and turns of humanity and forgiveness and destiny are well portrayed by Washington and Travolta.There are numerous very brief but well polished cameos by actors such as Luis Guzman and especially by Alex Kaluzhsky playing a young kid whose laptop conversation with his girlfriend opens up the entire story for the world to watch.

A lot of back story is squeezed into the film in an effort to deepen the drama.

Travolta easily steals the show even if he has nothing on Robert Shaw in the original.While Matthau was both funny and clever in the original. There's a mystery that had to be solved in the original by Matthau. Here Washington just talks to Travoltat to stall him and keep him from killing a hostage. It's the supporting characters that are thinking about who Ryder (Travolta) is and how is he planning on getting away.

Rooney,"[0, 0]","""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" may make you very reluctant to take a New York City subway train in fear of it being commandeered and you becoming a hostage under the control of a psychopathic killer like John Travolta. He lets out all the stops in this one giving a garish performance of an off-the-wall homicidal nutcase. Denzel Washington is at the opposite end portraying how an ordinary guy can stay fairly cool in the face of great stress although, at times, it seems as if he too will slip into the hyper-world.This is an incredibly exciting, gripping, suspenseful, fast-paced, and at times frenetic movie, that proves the power of movies to grab you, shake you up, and keep your eyes glued to the screen.The subway system, the way it operates, the nuts and bolts of it, have probably never been done this authentically before. On the surface streets cop cars and motorcycles race around a very brilliantly photographed Manhattan. There's comic relief (gags), a good performance by John Turturro as the hostage negotiator, and a less than effective performance by James Gandolfini as the Mayor.Technology and the Internet play roles in this new version of a 1974 movie. It's hectic, harrowing, at times gory and gruesome, but it will hold your attention unless you're a zombie.The two stars, veteran actors, complement each other very well, and it's good casting. Travolta's character elicits a surprising admission from Washington's.

It is just as hard to discuss events in any movie and have to use the old strawman expos&eacute;.  All weasel words aside.  This is an action and drama filled flick with some of the best acting I have seen in some time.  I appreciate skilled actors performing their roles to perfection and that is the case here.One element that would cause me to downgrade this movie is its Blu-ray format.  Like anyone else who has a blu-ray player we expect the very best in audio and video coming off the screen and out of the speakers.  That is not the case here or at least is not the case with my player for this film.  We read that Blu-ray is 6 times better than DVD.  I would love to see how that number was derived.  It is 6 times better than what?  It is not better by any factor for this movie.  My other Blu-rays are far better so I am at a lost.  I think it could be said that a purchase of this movie in DVD at a cheaper price will yield similar if not identical results.  If anyone knows what the difference is I sincerely would like to know.

1276942,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B002LMV7Q6,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","2009 marks the fourth time critically acclaimed actor Denzel Washington has teamed-up with director Tony Scott for a film. The previous three movies were outstanding crowd pleasers, from the intense character driven drama of ""Crimson Tide"", to the action-packed thrill-ride of ""Man on Fire"", followed by the surprisingly enjoyable time-jumping actioner ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"". With such extremely entertaining movies being produced from this actor/director combination, I had no reason to doubt that I would enjoy their fourth collaboration, the remake of ""The Taking of Pelham 123"".""The Taking of Pelham 123"" begins for subway dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) much like any other normal day; however, as Walter soon discovers this day will be far from normal. When a violent group of criminals, led by a seriously deranged man named Ryder (John Travolta), takes control of one of New York City's subway cars, Garber gets stuck in the middle of a deadly game where lives can be lost with one wrong move. What started as just another day has now become a race against time to meet a madman's ransom before innocent lives may be lost.Well, I must admit, this movie really surprised me in a couple of ways, and not necessarily for the best. For starters, it was a much smaller, more intimate character drama than I had anticipated from the previews. I knew that it would be a thriller, so the intensity would obviously be ratcheted way up, but I didn't foresee how narrow the majority of the movie's focus would be. Now, that's not a complaint implying that most of the movie was too small; on the contrary, I enjoyed that director Tony Scott moved away from the widespread action and mayhem that had permeated so many of his more recent movies (also not a complaint). Sometimes it's just nice to see a director who is known for a certain type of movie, take a step back and deliver something outside of their perceived comfort zone. Generally, when this happens the results can be quite refreshing and intriguing, to say the least.However, my second surprise came from the fact that despite being thoroughly entertained by the story for roughly 95% of the movie's duration (as expected), the film's confounding climax derailed the movie slightly, just before reaching its final destination. The tightly paced screenplay from writer Brian Helgeland (""Man on Fire"") was rife with tension, suspense, and drama; all of which provided the perfect recipe for an intriguing character drama, as I stated above. Yet, within the film's conclusion and for that matter even during a few scenes prior, it becomes slightly overblown and ultimately perplexing. What makes this a problem for me is the fact that when this occurs this once taut thrill ride begins to resemble just another action film (complete with an overdone crash sequence and an unrealistic chase scene) that doesn't feel like it fits in with the rest of the movie.What caused this problem to occur in this movie? I believe this is one of those instances where the director couldn't leave well enough alone, and just had to include a big, and altogether unnecessary, action scene to complete his vision. I'm putting the blame mostly on director Tony Scott for this lack of judgment, although to be fair I'm sure these trouble spots were included in Helgeland's screenplay (perhaps at the behest of Scott, who knows). Whatever the cause, Tony Scott knows how to make great movies, and should have known better than to hinder a potentially great thriller with needless action movie set pieces.Despite the complaint I just finished leveling at director Tony Scott, I do feel that he was a very solid choice for helming this movie. His hyper-kinetic visual style is perfectly suited to the kind of fast-paced thriller that Brian Helgeland's script demanded. Thankfully, Tony chose not to include all the washed out colors, pops of bright white across the screen, and various other camera filters and tricks that have been so heavily used in some of his recent work (i.e. ""Man on Fire""). Even though I enjoyed the movies where Tony used what he calls his ""shooting on acid"" style, it was beginning to become somewhat distracting for me as the viewer, especially in his film ""Domino"".Tony's more straight-forward approach to filming (which is reminiscent of his work on ""Enemy of the State""), meaning without all the weird filters and such, is far less jarring. That's not to say that this film's camera work is completely static and boring. After all, we are talking about Tony Scott, so as one would expect the movie is chock full of quick cuts, almost constant camera movement, and even some moments of slow-motion, freeze frames, and fast-forwards. One thing is for sure, if you're going to watch a Tony Scott film, you're almost always guaranteed to be in for a visually interesting experience.One area where the film definitely comes through is in the casting of the two lead characters. In the role of the story's protagonist, as anyone who has seen the preview should have deduced, is audience favorite Denzel Washington, taking over the role previously portrayed by screen legend Walter Matthau in the 1974 original. Denzel plays Walter Garber, a man beaten down by a thankless job, who is struggling to survive in a world that waits for no one. It's a part that could have been played with far less believability by some actors of Denzel's stature, but as always Denzel delivers yet another solid performance. Unlike some of his past roles, Walter is a far less confident man than what some have come to expect Denzel to portray. While Walter may not exude authority and command the respect that other Denzel characters have before; there is a quiet strength inherent in the character that connects with the audience and fills Garber with a steely resolve to see this ordeal through to its conclusion.The other lead actor in this film is the ever-reliable John Travolta (""Face/Off""), in yet another scene stealing villainous role. As the lead hijacker, Ryder, Travolta proves once again why he is generally a perfect choice for a cinematic villain. One moment he will be extremely charismatic and almost likeable, but in a split-second he will simply snap, becoming completely unhinged and unpredictable. So many actors struggle to break a good guy image once it's been solidified in the public's mindset; however, Travolta is one of the rare examples in which he has been able to successfully transition back and forth between good and evil roles without issue. Some critics argue that John's villains tend to feel over-exaggerated due to some over-acting on his part. I tend to disagree with this sentiment, at least in this instance (""Battlefield Earth"" on the other hand...). I think some critics perhaps mistake this character's almost bi-polar personality for over-acting, when in reality it is simply a drastic shift in his character's emotional composition. In my humble opinion, I believe John Travolta delivered another top-notch villainous performance that audiences will love to hate.In the supporting roles are some very talented, and always dependable actors such as, John Turturro (""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen""), James Gandolfini (TV's ""The Sopranos""), and Luis Guzman (""The Count of Monte Cristo""). John Turturro is given a much more serious, no-nonsense role this time around as opposed to the off-kilter, eccentric character he's more recently been associated with in the two ""Transformers"" movies. With John's character he could have easily remained very cold and one-dimensional; instead, he played him as a very empathetic man who loves his job and always wants to do what's right, not just what's convenient for those in power. With that conviction there is also a clear sense that Turturro's character feels somewhat betrayed by the job and perhaps even by the city he protects. It's a surprisingly more conflicted role than one would expect, and not surprisingly John handles it all with great ease.I mentioned a moment ago that James Gandolfini and Luis Guzman were two of the other supporting cast members, but unlike John Turturro their roles were far less interesting. Truthfully, I can't for the life of me understand why the casting director chose to waste two very good actors on essentially throwaway roles. As the mayor of New York City, James Gandolfini appears bored and unenthusiastic, but who can blame him when the role is so bland and generic. As for Luis Guzman, this terrific character actor is placed in a bit part as one of Travolta's henchmen; however, he's given so little to do within the story that you can't help but wonder why he even signed on for this movie.Perhaps it was the opportunity to get to work with Denzel Washington, John Travolta or director Tony Scott that drove those two actors to participate in thankless roles. Whatever the case may be, it is too bad more couldn't have been done to make their characters more interesting or important to the overall story.""The Taking of Pelham 123"" has all the makings of an incredibly relentless thrill ride, but some ill-fated decisions in the latter moments of the movie slightly derailed my enjoyment of the experience. All things considered, ""Pelham"" is still an entertaining movie, it's just got some problems that cause it to stumble to conclusion rather than roll along smoothly.""The Taking of Pelham 123"" is rated R for violence and pervasive language.",3,Great Thriller That Goes Slightly Off-Course...,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,9441,"['2009', 'fourth', 'time', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'actor',

While Denzel Washington provides a masterful exhibition of the actor's art in this action thriller, John Travolta simplistically hams it up like a two-bit clown in an slapstick vaudeville sketch.  Why didn't director Tony Scott do something about this?  Maybe Scott had some left-over respect for Travolta due to Travolta's memorable performances in other movies of years past.  But Travolta nearly ruins this film, and the director should have stepped in.The essential reason to watch this movie is to watch Denzel Washington.  Denzel brings nuanced, poetic reality to every minute he is on the screen.  In this film, he plays an Everyman, a civil servant desk jockey who, up to now, has never had to play the hero's role in life.  This is as naturalistic a performance as it could possibly be. I really appreciate the fact that Denzel labored so hard to breathe reality and truth into every single moment that he is on screen.  It is especially praiseworthy due to the fact that this film is, overall, not terribly special.  Only Denzel makes it worth seeing.""Pelham"" is a better than average, well-mounted heist film.  It has vibrant energy throughout.  The pace of the movie is electric, and it's not likely that anyone will be terribly bored watching it.  Some people may even find themselves royally entertained.

The film revolves around the negotiations between a compromised subway employee (Denzel Washington) and the leader of the hijackers (John Travolta) and the subterranean efforts of police and subway officials to save the hostages and get back their train.There aren't many content changes from the 1974 original except that the original was offbeat and exceptional for its time and the hijacking angle was far fresher in 1974, when everyone was hijacking a plane. The idea of hijacking a subway train was extremely fresh. By contrast the 2009 remake is, well, just another remake of something better we've seen before.One important footnote is that, in the 1974 version, Walther Matthau was cast against type in the signature role of the compromised good guy police lieutenat going after the bad guys whose leader was the redoubtable Robert Shaw (who was so great in JawsJaws (30th Anniversary Edition)), one of the greatest character actors of the 1970s or any other era.While Travolta tries very hard to be a mean guy in the remake, he is more comic caricature than three-dimensional evil. The remaining part players in the 1974 original, which include Martin Balsam of Psycho famePsycho (Collector's Edition), Hector Elizondo who played an unrelenting cop in American GigoloAmerican Gigoloand Jerry Stiller of SeinfeldSeinfeld - The Complete Series, all outpace their counterparts in last year's remake.One special disappointment was the casting and direction of John Turturro, one of America's best supporting players who has effectively characterized people ranging from football talking head Howard CosellMonday Night Mayhemto an ineffectual Jewish bookie involved with the mobMiller's Crossingto a prejudiced BrooklyniteJungle Fever.

1276956,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B002LMV7Q6,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[21, 25]","I'm a big fan of the original version of The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3.  It was a snapshot in time of New York City in the seventies; a cynical, bloated, bureaucratic mess that was entirely unprepared for a terrorist attack. In fact, there were actually concerns that the movie would inspire real terrorists to take a subway train hostage.  The original featured everything from undercover cops to hippies, a crisp military professional turned terrorist to the random accidents of people in stressful situations.  It even invented the ""color codenames"" later used in Reservoir Dogs.The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is catnip to movie directors in the same way that single stage sets are to theatrical directors - be it a subway or a stage with just two chairs, this is a film about two men facing off in a battle of wits. The majority of the movie takes place over an intercom between a terrorist and a dispatcher, with occasional cuts to the havoc their conversation causes throughout New York City.  And if the terrorist represents the international Other that is a threat to our national security, the dispatcher represents the everyman of New York, our hardworking servicemen and women who lost their lives on September 11.  With material like that, it's no wonder the film has been remade twice.Director Tony Scott updates the film to modern day sensibilities. The villain, Ryder (John Travolta in full crazy mode), isn't a mercenary applying crisp military precision to the art of extortion; he's a (SPOILER ALERT) former Wall Street tycoon - slightly lower on the villain totem pole than industrialists who pollute the environment.  The undercover cop moves into action immediately rather than later in the film, because of course New York's finest would respond quickly to a terrorist attack. And the dispatcher, Walter Garber (Denzel Washington, looking appropriately puffy and slouched) has a more complicated past and a bigger role.Unfortunately, the film suffers as a result.  In the original, military precision was entirely the point.  The trains never ran on time, so challenging New York to meet a deadline was both a delicious irony and a sticking point with a former military officer who expects nothing less than perfection from his men and from the negotiators. Here, that point is muddled by a sort of ""we're all into this together"" blue collar ethic that Ryder projects into Garber. Their dialogue still crackles, but this simple change dilutes the force of the film.The four-man team of bad guys is reduced to two speaking parts, with the other two generic thugs.  The emphasis is clearly on Travolta and Washington, and it's refreshing to have a movie that's not afraid to spend some time letting actors just act.  There's a lot of talking in this film and that's not a bad thing.The movie struggles with the modern updates. A live wireless webcam feed gets broadcast to the Internet without government interference (yeah, right). Even though the laptop's battery dies, it's mysteriously back on a moment later. And the two teens on either side of the webcam come off as self-absorbed morons.Because this is a big budget action film, the quiet subtlety of the original version is glossed over in favor of an MTA agent handling a hostage negotiation, wielding a gun, and ultimately engaging in a showdown with the bad guy. Since Ryder has no principles to speak of, the conclusion is particularly unsatisfying.Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 is a serviceable action film but not a particularly good update of the original. The seventies version was more of a drama with an ensemble cast that was comfortable playing second fiddle to the biggest character of all: New York City.",3,If I can make it there...,1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,3682,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'version', 'Taking', 'Pelham', '1', '2', '3', 'was', 'snapshot', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'seventies', 'cynical', 'bloated', 'bureaucratic', 'mess', 'was', 'entirely', 'unprepared', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'fact', 'were', 'actually', 'concerns', 'movie', 'would', 'inspire', 'real', 'terrorists', 'take', 'subway', 'train', 'hostage', 'original', 'featured', 'everything', 'undercover', 'cops', 'hippies', 'crisp', 'military', 'professional', 'turned', 'terrorist', 'random', 'accidents', 'people', 'stressful', 'situations', 'even', 'invented', 'color', 'codenames', 'later', 'used', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs.The', 'Taking', 'Pelham', '1', '2', '3', 'catnip', 'movie', 'directors', 'same', 'way', 'single', 'stage', 'sets', 'are', 'theatrical', 'directors', 'be', 'subway', 'stage', 'just', 'two', 'chairs', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'facing', 'off', 'battle', 'wits', 'majority', 'movie', 'place', 'intercom', 'terrorist', 'dispatcher', 'occasional', 'cuts', 'havoc', 'conversation', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'terrorist', 'international', 'Other', 'threat', 'national', 'security', 'dispatcher', 'everyman', 'New', 'York', 'hardworking', 'servicemen', 'women', 'who', 'lost', 'lives', 'September', '11', 'material', 'wonder', 'film', 'been', 'remade', 'twice.Director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'film', 'modern', 'day', 'sensibilities', 'villain', 'Ryder', 'John', 'Travolta', 'full', 'crazy', 'mode', ""n't"", 'mercenary', 'applying', 'crisp', 'military', 'precision', 'art', 'extortion', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'former', 'Wall', 'Street', 'tycoon', 'slightly', 'lower', 'villain', 'totem', 'pole', 'industrialists', 'who', 'pollute', 'environment', 'undercover', 'cop', 'moves', 'action', 'immediately', 'rather', 'later', 'film', 'course', 'New', 'York', 'finest', 'would', 'respond', 'quickly', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'dispatcher', 'Walter', 'Garber', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'looking', 'appropriately', 'puffy', 'slouched', 'more', 'complicated', 'past', 'bigger', 'role.Unfortunately', 'film', 'suffers', 'result', 'original', 'military', 'precision', 'was', 'entirely', 'point', 'trains', 'never', 'ran', 'time', 'so', 'challenging', 'New', 'York', 'meet', 'deadline', 'was', 'delicious', 'irony', 'sticking', 'point', 'former', 'military', 'officer', 'who', 'nothing', 'less', 'perfection', 'men', 'negotiators', 'Here', 'point', 'muddled', 'sort', ""'re"", 'together', 'blue', 'collar', 'ethic', 'Ryder', 'projects', 'Garber', 'dialogue', 'still', 'simple', 'change', 'force', 'film.The', 'four-man', 'team', 'bad', 'guys', 'reduced', 'two', 'speaking', 'parts', 'other', 'two', 'generic', 'thugs', 'emphasis', 'clearly', 'Travolta', 'Washington', 'refreshing', 'have', 'movie', 'not', 'afraid', 'spend', 'time', 'letting', 'actors', 'just', 'act', 'lot', 'talking', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'thing.The', 'movie', 'modern', 'updates', 'live', 'wireless', 'webcam', 'feed', 'broadcast', 'Internet', 'government', 'interference', 'yeah', 'right', 'Even', 'laptop', 'battery', 'mysteriously', 'back', 'moment', 'later', 'two', 'teens', 'side', 'webcam', 'come', 'off', 'self-absorbed', 'morons.Because', 'big', 'budget', 'action', 'film', 'quiet', 'subtlety', 'original', 'version', 'glossed', 'favor', 'MTA', 'agent', 'handling', 'hostage', 'negotiation', 'wielding', 'gun', 'ultimately', 'engaging', 'showdown', 'bad', 'guy', 'Ryder', 'principles', 'speak', 'conclusion', 'particularly', 'unsatisfying.Taking', 'Pelham', '1', '2', '3', 'serviceable', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'update', 'original', 'seventies', 'version', 'was', 'more', 'drama', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'second', 'fiddle', 'biggest', 'character', 'New', 'York', 'City']",N/A

Not a  horrible movie by any means, but if you watch the trailer you'll think of it as a fast-paced action movie with some bits of comedy and thriller mixed in. The action movie, however, is rarely like this - almost every bit of action in the movie is shown in the trailer. The rest are negotiation/discussions between Travolta and Denzel. While both did fine, you never really cared about any of the cast - the good guys, the bad guys or the other guys. The characters were somewhat boring (Travolta seems to be going in the direction of the character he played in From Paris With Love (a great character!) but he just never gets there. Another big disappointment was Luis Guzman - normally hilarious, he has a very small (and non-comedic) role in this one - Seems like a waste!Being a Tony Scott film it has all sorts of fast-cuts and weird edits/effects. Normally I love these (like in Domino), but this one just uses the SAME effect over and over (whenever theres a helicopter or subway driving by, it cuts to a ""stop motion"" type effect (slow shutter speed)). Really annoying, really overdone.The Blu-Ray itself is pretty good though - about an hour worth of documentary/behind the scenes footage (interesting to see how much the NYC MTA helped with the film and gave them access), some of it a bit odder than others (a 6 minute video on the hair stylist?) - it also has 2 commentary tracks. Video is very good (about 4.5 - 5 out of 5 - great especially since this film is mostly filmed in dark tunnels), audio is very good as well. Movie gets about a 3/5, audio/video about a 5/5, extras a 4/5, overall about a 4/5.If you were hooked by the trailer, just know the movie isn't quite like that.

A story which was quite unique 35 years ago is no longer anything special and the performances were all over the map. Denzel Washington gained 40 or so pounds for the part and was quite believable playing this low key character, but John Travolta played this villain like the wild one in Face Off. It worked in that other film, because just about every scene was so over the top, but everything here is based in reality so it came across as almost cartoonish at times. Don't get me wrong, he seemed to be having a great time playing the character and he did have a few good lines, but we have already seen this character done better in that John Woo movie back in 1997.

KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[1, 1]","I'm a fan of the original witty film, but thought this remake would have given us a little more of an intense ride to update the original. While the story starts fairly strong, it doesn't add enough energy to replace the original's wit and charm. I also found with all the breakthrough technology that has occurred in the last 30-40 years, this film has some pretty stupid moments. i.e tracking device in the money bags (Hello!) and Travolta's character gives the authorities too many clues to figure out who he might be.

1276963,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B002LMV7Q6,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[0, 0]","Tony Scott returns once more to the action movie, and does the sort of slick production job we have come to expect from him, with trusty stalwart Denzel Washington along for the ride.  Though one has to say, that this time, he's not really on top form - we are well short of `Man on Fire' territory here.This remake of the 70's classic has the same circumstances unfolding but with a slightly different slant - taking away much of the cold and calculating side to the villain, and imbuing the Washington character with some backstory.  (He's under investigation, it turns out).  So, we still have a subway train hijacked, this time by a tattooed and heckling Travolta.  Washington plays the subway employee who happens to be the dispatcher when it all goes down, and his character works best while cooped up with only a microphone to liaise with the hijacker.  Sadly he fails to convince as readily when he is out on the street and in the subway to face off directly with Travolta's character.  John Turturro and James Gandolfini round out the supporting cast.The action, such as it is, is adequate enough, but never quite wrings tension in the way you feel it ought to.  In particular, one extended runaway train sequence never quite develops a sense of genuine threat , and the resolution to the scene never has the sense of relief / release it seems was intended.  The character development feels particularly broad stroked, lacking the sort of minor detail that convinces us enough to invest our emotions in the movie.  Washington's recent history feels shoehorned in rather than coming organically from the story, and when he starts playing the reluctant action hero, we are left chuckling at how unlikely it is, rather than feeling he is truly caught up in the drama.  As for Travolta, one is inclined to think he should just stop playing bad guys.. his character feels like an over the top panto villain, with a few lines of expositionary dialogue squeezed in to the script in an attempt to give him depth.  It doesn't work.  And then finally, in stark contrast to the original, the ending is all too predictable.So while the end result is a passable action movie with some genuine starpower, the bottom line is that those yearning for the intelligence and sticky tense atmosphere of the original will be disappointed, as will those expecting a bangs and bullets modern `Tony Scott' action movie.  It's a movie which is less than the sum of its parts - but the parts are still good enough to come through the muddle worth a couple of hours of your time, thanks in large part to a few dry comedic moments thrown in... as well as a few unintentional laughs along the way.",3,Action movie that doesn't quite stay on track,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,2676,"['Tony', 'Scott', 'once', 'more', 'action', 'movie', 'sort', 'slick', 'production', 'job', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'trusty', 'stalwart', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'ride', 'one', 'say', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'top', 'form', 'are', 'well', 'short', 'Man', 'Fire', 'territory', 'here.This', 'remake', '70', 'classic', 'same', 'circumstances', 'unfolding', 'slightly', 'different', 'slant', 'taking', 'away', 'much', 'cold', 'calculating', 'side', 'villain', 'imbuing', 'Washington', 'character', 'backstory', 'investigation', 'out', 'So', 'still', 'have', 'subway', 'train', 'hijacked', 'time', 'tattooed', 'heckling', 'Travolta', 'Washington', 'subway', 'employee', 'who', 'be', 'dispatcher', 'when', 'down', 'character', 'best', 'cooped', 'up', 'only', 'microphone', 'liaise', 'hijacker', 'Sadly', 'convince', 'readily', 'when', 'out', 'street', 'subway', 'face', 'off', 'directly', 'Travolta', 'character', 'John', 'Turturro', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'round', 'supporting', 'cast.The', 'action', 'such', 'adequate', 'enough', 'never', 'quite', 'wrings', 'tension', 'way', 'feel', 'ought', 'particular', 'one', 'extended', 'runaway', 'train', 'sequence', 'never', 'quite', 'sense', 'genuine', 'threat', 'resolution', 'scene', 'never', 'sense', 'relief', '/', 'release', 'was', 'intended', 'character', 'development', 'feels', 'particularly', 'broad', 'stroked', 'lacking', 'sort', 'minor', 'detail', 'enough', 'invest', 'emotions', 'movie', 'Washington', 'recent', 'history', 'feels', 'shoehorned', 'rather', 'coming', 'organically', 'story', 'when', 'playing', 'reluctant', 'action', 'hero', 'are', 'left', 'chuckling', 'how', 'unlikely', 'rather', 'feeling', 'truly', 'caught', 'up', 'drama', 'Travolta', 'one', 'inclined', 'think', 'should', 'just', 'stop', 'playing', 'bad', 'guys..', 'character', 'feels', 'top', 'panto', 'villain', 'few', 'lines', 'expositionary', 'dialogue', 'squeezed', 'script', 'attempt', 'give', 'depth', ""n't"", 'work', 'then', 'finally', 'stark', 'contrast', 'original', 'ending', 'too', 'predictable.So', 'end', 'result', 'passable', 'action', 'movie', 'genuine', 'starpower', 'bottom', 'line', 'yearning', 'intelligence', 'sticky', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'original', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'will', 'expecting', 'bangs', 'bullets', 'modern', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'action', 'movie', 'movie', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'parts', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'come', 'muddle', 'worth', 'couple', 'hours', 'time', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'few', 'dry', 'comedic', 'moments', 'thrown', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'unintentional', 'laughs', 'way']",N/A

That said, I thought this was a gritty, evenly-paced and suspenseful story that admittedly breaks down in a few spots, but is held together by some admirable work by the star actors.  Travolta and Washington were in fine form, and John Turturro did a nice job as well.  I wasn't particularly impressed by Gandolfini or Guzman, but their roles were decidedly secondary and didn't really detract from the story.I won't get into the plot since others have done enough of that and I don't want to reveal any spoilers.  However, I will say that the storyline was a bit cliche, there were some credulity-straining time lapses given the very tight timeline being depicted.  Lastly, the wrap-up was a bit anti-climactic (and too tidy), but I loved Travolta's parting line.  Overall, I thought the cut-scenes and use of accelerated camera moves added to the tense feel of the story, and created a very entertaining effect.

I mean, I have read the book and I thought it was pretty cool, but nothing amazing, and in the end it was just a time passer. However, one day, my girlfriend and I went to go see ""The Hangover"". After being unable to get tickets due to it being sold out, we decided to see ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" instead. It was opening weekend for this movie, and so we thought ""if not for The Hangover, why not TTOP123?"" We gave it a chance.I was a bit skeptical, since the book was satisfactory at best. I thought it had a lot of good parts, but for the most part, felt rather more like a series of explanations of characters than a story. And I thought that ending was a total WTF moment. However, much to my surprised, I ended up really loving the movie more than I thought I would! When you take a story that's disjointed, it's hard to turn it into something substantial; however Tony Scott managed to do just that. Let it be said that I am in no shape or form a fan of Scott, I enjoyed films like ""Enemy of the Sate"" and ""Domino"", but I was ultimately let down by ""D&eacute;j&agrave; vu"". It just felt totally dumb and lopsided, and way too complicated for its own good.Passengers on an afternoon train, Pelham 1 2 3, are just having an easy and laid-back day- that is, until Ryder and 3 other baddies come in and hijack it. They disconnect the train, leave one car on the tracks and take everyone on the train hostage. Ryder keeps in constant contact with Walter Garber, who is in the control center. Through radio, they keep in contact, and Ryder comes up with an unrealistic request- that they must have exactly $10,000,000 to them in an hour. If it doesn't get there on time, they will shoot one passenger for every minute that goes by. The Mayor, The deputy of the police dep't, and even  a hostage named George (A.K.A. Geo) get involved, and lucky Geo has a laptop with a webcam, thus allowing his girlfriend who he's chatting with to get the network to tap into the connection so that this footage can be broadcast live.This movie is for 3 audiences:1. People who love Tony Scott2. People who are action/thriller junkies (like me)3. People who love Denzel and/or JohnAnd if you are any of the above, it is recommended that you see this movie! Of course it's not perfect, but it's a brainless and totally fun action thriller with tons of suspense, excitement and action. However, the best things about this movie are the two leads- Denzel Washington and John Travolta. They offer amazing performances! Denzel continues his awesome acting streak as Walter Garber. He ditches his usual ""Cool bad guy"" style for a family man and desperate business man style and he does well, whereas Travolta manages to play a psycho very well! This has been called his ""comeback role"", I am not surprised.

This book got me interested in the thriller-suspense genre and in many ways is one of my comparisons for most thrillers I read now.Of course, I followed up with the initial film adaptation starring Walter Matthau a few years later. This film was taut, suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.Yes, I came to the theatre with preconceived notions and for the most part, director Scott and the cast lived up to them.  This version of ""Pelham"" is darker, dirtier, and more up to date than the last.  The story's entered into the age of cellular phones and Internet.Story in brief:  Walter Garber (Washington) is a NYC transit authority official under suspicion of a bribery charge who's been demoted to serving as a railway dispatcher while his court case is adjudicated. He just happens to be on duty when the Pelham 123 train is taken by Ryder (John Travolta). Ryder's got 17 hostages and if the city doesn't pay him 10M in an hour, he's going to start killing people for every minute they're late.Garber's actually the perfect man to conduct the negotiations.  He's worked his way up the ranks of the subway system and he knows those tunnels like the back of his hand.  And yes, he understands the darker side of human nature and he's not the kind of man to fall under pressure.Ryder's a mystery at first, but as Garber questions him, he reveals facets of his nature that both intrigue and repel us. Ryder's motivation is a devious plan within a plan that unfolds as news broadcasts update us on what's going on in the city as the hostage situation comes to a head.The plot moves forward at almost breakneck speed. Violence and police chases are very real--almost too real in places. An interesting side note is the addition of the Internet in this scenario. One of the passengers was engaged in an online chat with his girlfriend when the train was taken and the events inside the rail car are broadcast over the world wide web.Warning:  If you have issues with fast, blurring pans that denote speed, don't go see this film.  If blurring of the film gives you either a headache or makes you dizzy, this film's got a lot of cinematography from that school of thought.Rebecca Kyle, June 2009",3,Read the book instead unless you are a fan of Washington or Travolta,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,2280,"['initially', 'read', 'John', 'Godey', 'novel', 'back', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'book', 'got', 'interested', 'thriller-suspense', 'genre', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'comparisons', 'most', 'thrillers', 'read', 'now.Of', 'course', 'followed', 'up', 'initial', 'film', 'adaptation', 'starring', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'was', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'throughout.Yes', 'came', 'theatre', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'most', 'part', 'director', 'Scott', 'cast', 'lived', 'up', 'version', 'Pelham', 'darker', 'dirtier', 'more', 'up', 'date', 'last', 'story', 'entered', 'age', 'cellular', 'phones', 'Internet.Story', 'brief', 'Walter', 'Garber', 'Washington', 'NYC', 'transit', 'authority', 'official', 'suspicion', 'bribery', 'charge', 'who', 'been', 'demoted', 'serving', 'railway', 'dispatcher', 'court', 'case', 'adjudicated', 'just', 'be', 'duty', 'when', 'Pelham', '123', 'train', 'taken', 'Ryder', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Ryder', 'got', '17', 'hostages', 'city', ""n't"", 'pay', '10M', 'hour', 'going', 'start', 'killing', 'people', 'minute', ""'re"", 'late.Garber', 'actually', 'perfect', 'man', 'conduct', 'negotiations', 'worked', 'way', 'ranks', 'subway', 'system', 'tunnels', 'back', 'hand', 'yes', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'not', 'kind', 'man', 'fall', 'pressure.Ryder', 'mystery', 'first', 'Garber', 'questions', 'facets', 'nature', 'intrigue', 'repel', 'Ryder', 'motivation', 'devious', 'plan', 'plan', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'update', 'what', 'going', 'city', 'hostage', 'situation', 'head.The', 'plot', 'forward', 'almost', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'Violence', 'police', 'chases', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'almost', 'too', 'real', 'places', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'addition', 'Internet', 'scenario', 'One', 'passengers', 'was', 'engaged', 'online', 'chat', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'train', 'was', 'taken', 'events', 'rail', 'car', 'are', 'broadcast', 'world', 'wide', 'web.Warning', 'have', 'issues', 'fast', 'blurring', 'pans', 'denote', 'speed', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'film', 'blurring', 'film', 'headache', 'dizzy', 'film', 'got', 'lot', 'cinematography', 'school', 'thought.Rebecca', 'Kyle', 'June', '2009']",N/A
1276973,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002LMV7Q6,RMurray847,"[16, 23]","TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 will be forgotten in a matter of a few weeks.  Then it'll come out on DVD, have a brief burst of activity, and then fade forever from the cultural landscape.  It is such a tremendously disposable movie, evaporating from the mind even as the closing credits roll behind you as you walk out of the theatre.This is not to say that it isn't diverting and mildly entertaining...it's just ultimately so unremarkable.And this is too bad, because the original movie from the `70s still sticks with me to this day.  In the `70s, the story was actually somewhat unique.  We have a humble, aging, unambitious transit cop who through just sheer bad luck ends up on the intercom with a cold, ruthless killer who has hijacked an NYC subway car purely for the chance to make a pile of money.  Will this working-stiff be able to outlast & outwit the dangerous sociopath?  The film came out in a time when ruthless sociopaths were relatively new to the movie screen (the looney in DIRTY HARRY also springs to mind).  Very few people had played the kind of super-smart, cold-blooded mastermind that Robert Shaw pulled off so well in PELHAM.  And few actors had the ""schlubby"" looks and ordinary common-sense (and public goodwill) of Walter Matthau, who pulled off this unusual role (for him) with effortlessness.  These two stars were ably supported by a nice supporting cast, including Martin Balsam as Shaw's mild-mannered associate in crime and a chilling Hector Elizondo as Shaw's trigger man, a criminal more interested in killing than making money.So when the bad guys demand their million dollars, and then put an impossible deadline on receiving the money:  ""have it here in one hour or I will kill one hostage for every minute you're late,"" the tension level was sky-high.  This was a grimy, crime-ridden NYC...and it was a low tech time.In Tony Scott's update, NYC is shiny and clean & high-tech is all over the place.  Heck, one of the hostages inadvertently streams the entire even to the world through his laptop.  Walter Matthau's mismatched clothes and weary demeanor are replaced by Denzel Washington's crisp intelligence.  (This actually works okay.  It's a very different character, but Washington gives one of his more credible performances of late.)  And Robert Shaw's trenchcoat wearing, ultra-calm madman is replaced by a tattooed, bug-eyed, wildly laughing and foul-mouthed John Travolta.  Worst of all, the well-thought-out supporting cast of criminals is replaced by some very generic ""guys with machine guns"" and a very underused Luis Guzman, who is barely asked to give a performance.Both films have the same ticking clock, and that is the part of the story that always works.  Tension IS created, as the two adversaries bond via their old-school CB radios.  John Torturro is a welcome addition as a hostage negotiator.  And a subplot is created to give some added complexity to Washington's character.  This sub-plot is not really needed, but it does add a little moral texturing...as though it is no longer acceptable to have a good guy against a bad guy.  Nowadays, even the good guys need to have some questionable events in their past.James Gandolfini is amusing as New York's mayor...but honestly, I think that was mostly because it was amusing to think of Tony Soprano as the mayor of NYC.  The part is sketchily written...although Gandolfini is clearly having a lot of fun with it, even when the part gets hokey at the end.Tony Scott is NOT a director I admire.  Knowing he was at the helm almost kept me out of the theater.  His super-saturated colors and jumpy, flashing editing style tend to annoy the heck out of me.  It's all style that doesn't contribute one bit to substance.  He makes us aware that we're watching a movie when we should actually be absorbed by it.  (MAN OF FIRE is the most egregious example of this...but most of his movies are ""over directed."")  And Scott is guilty here again.  His way of showing us how much time is left on the clock is, frankly, hugely distracting.  And he actually uses something akin to Google Maps to show us the progress of a car through NYC.  It flashes by too fast to be useful, yet is there long enough to annoy.But worst of all is John Travolta's horrific performance.  It seems as though he really just doesn't know how to give a modulated performance anymore.  In PELHAM, he yells, cusses (boy, does he cuss!!), giggles, grimaces and scowls.  All in the service of a thoroughly unconvincing performance.  Apparently, he's never learned that less can sometimes be more.  He's acting in the style that Tony Scott directs.  He succeeds in creating the most unmenacing psycho-killer in quite some time.The film also suffers from a very anti-climactic ending.  It assumes that you've grown to care a lot about the ""moral gray area"" in Washington's character...which we have not.  Thus, the end doesn't work too well, and when the closing credits roll, we dutifully walk out of the theatre, wondering where to go eat or if anything good is on TV.",3,Watchable but UTTERLY

1276977,A6FIAB28IS79,B002LMV7Q6,Samuel Chell,"[0, 0]","If testimony to the strength this thriller is needed, I hit upon this movie out of the blue and, despite a decided aversion to all of the crime, deviant, law and order television dramas others in my household watch as a daily diversion, I found myself drawn in by genuine cinematic production values, from the shots of NYC to the expensive if formulaic car chases, crashes, escapes and near-escapes.But it wasn't until 20 minutes of watching a familiar plot device (ransom plot with the bad guys holding up the money guys with threats of shooting hostages one by one) that I recognized the actors--the villainous dude was the normally gentle-voiced, likable John Travolta, and the hero was Denzel Washington, who once appeared on the cover of Time magazine as an example of a perfectly sculptured human face, the kind any of us could fall in love with.  He's likable enough in this film but not because of his Byronic looks.  He's packed on a few pounds, looks a bit sloppy and nerdish and altogether pedestrian.Neither character comes close to over-acting, yet they leave their mark in a film with more car crashes than all of Mack Sennett's movies put together along with numerous editing effects, a hyper-active camera, and post-shooting digital inserts to compete with.To top it off, a real movie, like most fictional literary works, has a prior point of reference, a precursor of which it must be seen as a revision.  Using the same essential ""story,"" the genealogy of a film--the original, the remake, the remake of the remake--invites us to study the director and actors, to see how both deal with the ""anxiety of influence,"" as well as to weigh the significance of the film in the context of an entirely different time period.The earlier version clearly had some of Hollywood's most memorable, professional character actors (beginning with Walter Matthau) as well as a more colorful if more squalid NYC and was set after Watergate and during the Viet Nam War.

And, if you have your home theater sound system set up, the DVD audio with all the subway sound effects is great.

And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in The Taking of Pelham 123 was all the way back in 1992'sMalcolm X(he played Malcolm X).And John Travolta as a bad guy? I don't know...for me it just seems as forced as it was inFace/Off. Certainly he was a classic bad guy inPulp Fiction, but in PF he was a bad guy that you rooted for and loved. In Taking of Pelham 123 I just couldn't take Travolta's portrayal too seriously.Now that all said about Washington and Travolta, I was entertained by Tony Scott'sremakeof Taking of Pelham 123. Simple story: Travolta hijacks a subway train in NYC, and Washington is in the subway traffic control room as liaison between the good guys and bad guys. Scott keeps the movie rolling down the track with some decent suspenseful action. The cops and Washington's superiors are idiots (as Hollywood so predictably and consistently casts) and mild mannered Denzel tries to save the day.The movie gets an R from the MPAA not so much for some mildly graphic shootings, but more so for perhaps winning the 2009 ""most utterances of the F word"" award.All in all, I was entertained.

The story is exciting and the screenplay is by Brian Helgeland. With Denzel Washington (and to some extent John Travolta) I thought how bad can it be?Pretty bad. Tony Scott usually covers up his inadequacy at storytelling with lots of needless fast cutting and pointless special effects. He really works at the level of TV advertisements (the flashy, shallow kind - not the good ones). ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" has lots of his usual razzle dazzle, but the surprise is that Helgeland's script is so poor. The dialogue is one-dimensional and has the usual action cliches (lots of ""MF"" in the first half).There are tacky coincidences - such as one of the passengers chatting online with his girlfriend at the time of the hijack - that don't even lead anywhere. In fact, those two young characters are obviously included to appeal to that demographic; they serve no dramatic purpose. The characterisation beyond the two leads is non-existent. And there's little explanation how a few years in jail turned a high level Wall Street businessman into someone who seems like a hardened working class dock worker.There really isn't anything to redeem this film.

Suffice it to say that this film is well done, tense and draws you in.  I only review the quality of the Blu Ray disc itself.  I do not have the Standard Def version so this is also not a comparison between the two formats. My Blu Ray copy also has a digital disc which I have not bothered to look at.While I do not know of the quality of the standard def version, the blu ray film starts a bit rough visually.  There appeared to be alot of grain, some even crawling in the early minutes of the film but the apparent grain seemed to disappear after the first five minutes.  This movie is heavily color graded in warm and dark tones and I could say that the color grading created the grain, however as the film proceeds the grain went away even tho the grading did not.  Other than that the video transfer showed no artifacting or aliasing.  The blacks were pretty heavily crushed during the color corrections and some fine details are lost but 'dark' is what the late Tony Scott was apparently looking for and he successfully got it.The audio is DTS HD 5.1 and the lossless audio is heads and tails above lossy audio.  That said, most audio will be across the front stage with some nice panning and a few foley fx.  The rear sound stage was also used but sparingly when, I believe, in light of the type of action sequences in the film, the rears could have been given more discreet directionality.There are plenty of extras on the BR disc including a 30 minute Making Of documentary, a very interesting 15 minute doc on N.Y.'s subway system, descriptive audio tracks, trailers and more.While I do not think that The Taking of Pelham 123 would be good to use as a DEMO disc for your system, it is, never the less, a fine and captivating film that can stand on its own.

Washington's character is strong, vibrant, but understated. The performance is relaxed without being sleepy or underplayed. Travolta's character is broadly played by the actor, perhaps overplayed. A little more subtelty and finesse would have increased the enjoyment of the film.The Taking of Pelham 123 isn't perfect, and is not as good as the original, but it is well worth seeing.",4,Team-Up of Washington and Travolta Captivating - Movie Is Flawed But Well-Made,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,1404,"['Taking', 'Pelham', '123', 'modern', 'remake', 'classic', '70', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'movie', 'based', 'John', 'Godey', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'subway', 'train', 'Pelham', '123', 'taken', 'hostage', 'ransom', 'demands', 'made', 'Matthau', 'was', 'policeman', 'negotiating', 'hostages', 'Shaw', 'was', 'leader', 'hijackers.In', 'updated', 'version', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'hostage', 'negotiator', 'time', 'transit', 'official', 'who', 'working', 'desk', 'job', 'suspension', 'pending', 'outcome', 'bribery', 'investigation', 'John', 'Travolta', 'leader', 'hijackers', 'angry', 'bitter', 'man', 'who', 'Ryder', 'film', 'directed', 'Washington', 'preferred', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'brother', 'Ridley', 'film', 'action', 'panache', 'become', 'hallmark', 'brother', 'careers', 'are', 'scenes', 'dread', 'terror', 'suspense', 'excruciating', 'car', 'chases', 'whipsmart', 'dialogue', 'two', 'antagonists.The', 'two', 'main', 'performances', 'are', 'key', 'film', 'Washington', 'character', 'strong', 'vibrant', 'understated', 'performance', 'relaxed', 'being', 'sleepy', 'underplayed', 'Travolta', 'character', 'broadly', 'played', 'actor', 'perhaps', 'overplayed', 'little', 'more', 'subtelty', 'finesse', 'would', 'have', 'increased', 'enjoyment', 'film.The', 'Taking', 'Pelham', '123', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

Denzel Washington's quick-witted and moderately corrupt dispatcher plays off of John Travolta's Wall Street savvy sociopath with plenty of clever exchanges, and the dark humor and suspense that find its way into the bloodshed culminates in an engaging game of cat and mouse. Not quite as slick as the original, and perhaps a little too conspicuous in its efforts at exuding cool, this latest take on the subway heist story still accomplishes entertainment at break-neck speed.When a New York City subway train is hijacked, Rail Control Center dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) becomes an unwitting negotiator for the ruthless criminals aboard. Led by the uncontainable Ryder (John Travolta), the hijackers demand ten million dollars in exchange for the seventeen hostages and offer only one hour to deliver the ransom. As minutes quickly count down, Garber must utilize his cunning and resourcefulness to buy time and catch the mercenary off guard as the situation goes from bad to catastrophic.The unusual, highly stylized, frenzied editing is assuredly a now permanent technique for Tony Scott films - it's a signature method that he ceaselessly experiments with, frequently going overboard, and only occasionally able to harness. In Pelham it looks familiar but doesn't detract from the story, even if some moments of suspense are dulled by the blurred colors of slow-motion and missing frames. The remaining stunt sequences are exciting and tense, but hardly necessary. The car chases are never about catching someone, but rather beating the clock. It's action for action's sake, and while enjoyably destructive, it's entirely apparent.Most audiences will not know that The Taking of Pelham 123 is based on a John Godey novel, or that it's been adapted into a movie twice before with the same name. While Scott's version stands on its own as a big-budget action movie, the purpose of specifically remaking this story is puzzling. Shouldn't the reasoning behind the revisiting of a popular plot be to improve upon some outstanding aspect? The use of the internet, cell phones, snipers, bloodshed, crude language and more give this new vision a sparklingly modernized feel, but when the movie draws to a close, it just can't compete with the 1974 version. Washington and Travolta have an intriguing chemistry, but even that can't outdo the cat-and-mouse mindgames between Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw, who played their counterparts in the first feature adaptation. Perhaps a title change could have appropriately distanced Scott's take from being endlessly compared to an infinitely superior film.- The Massie Twins",3,The Taking of Pelham 123 Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,2810,"['Scott', 'uniquely', 'frenetic', 'editing', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'previous', 'films', 'unmistakable', 'style', 'still', 'action', 'tension-filled', 'premise', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'quick-witted', 'moderately', 'corrupt', 'dispatcher', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Wall', 'Street', 'savvy', 'sociopath', 'plenty', 'clever', 'exchanges', 'dark', 'humor', 'suspense', 'find', 'way', 'bloodshed', 'culminates', 'engaging', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'slick', 'original', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'conspicuous', 'efforts', 'exuding', 'cool', 'latest', 'take', 'subway', 'heist', 'story', 'still', 'entertainment', 'break-neck', 'speed.When', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'subway', 'train', 'hijacked', 'Rail', 'Control', 'Center', 'dispatcher', 'Walter', 'Garber', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'unwitting', 'negotiator', 'ruthless', 'criminals', 'aboard', 'Led', 'uncontainable', 'Ryder', 'John', 'Travolta', 'hijackers', 'demand', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'exchange', 'seventeen', 'hostages', 'offer', 'only', 'one', 'hour', 'deliver', 'ransom', 'minutes', 'quickly', 'count', 'down', 'Garber', 'must', 'utilize', 'cunning', 'resourcefulness', 'buy', 'time', 'catch', 'mercenary', 'off', 'guard', 'situation', 'bad', 'catastrophic.The', 'unusual', 'highly', 'stylized', 'frenzied', 'editing', 'assuredly', 'now', 'permanent', 'technique', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'films', 'signature', 'method', 'experiments', 'frequently', 'going', 'overboard', 'only', 'occasionally', 'able', 'harness', 'Pelham', 'familiar', ""n't"", 'detract', 'story', 'even', 'moments', 'suspense', 'are', 'dulled', 'blurred', 'colors', 'slow-motion', 'missing', 'frames', 'remaining', 'stunt', 'sequences', 'are', 'exciting', 'tense', 'hardly', 'necessary', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'never', 'catching', 'someone', 'rather', 'beating', 'clock', 'action', 'action', 'sake', 'enjoyably', 'destructive', 'entirely', 'apparent.Most', 'audiences', 'will', 'not', 'know', 'Taking', 'Pelham', '123', 'based', 'John', 'Godey', 'novel', 'been', 'adapted', 'movie', 'twice', 'same', 'name', 'Scott', 'version', 'own', 'big-budget', 'action', 'movie', 'purpose', 'specifically', 'remaking', 'story', 'puzzling', 'Should', ""n't"", 'reasoning', 'revisiting', 'popular', 'plot', 'be', 'improve', 'outstanding', 'aspect', 'use', 'internet', 'cell', 'phones', 'snipers', 'bloodshed', 'crude', 'language', 'more', 'give', 'new', 'vision', 'sparklingly', 'modernized', 'feel', 'when', 'movie', 'close', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', '1974', 'version', 'Washington', 'Travolta', 'have', 'intriguing', 'chemistry', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'outdo', 'cat-and-mouse', 'mindgames', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'who', 'played', 'counterparts', 'first', 'feature', 'adaptation', 'Perhaps', 'title', 'change', 'could', 'have', 'appropriately', 'distanced', 'Scott', 'take', 'being', 'endlessly', 'compared', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'film.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

1276994,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002LMV7Q6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 1]","""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"", Tony Scott's (""Deja Vu"", ""Crimson Tide"") new film starring Denzel Washington, John Travolta and James Gandolfini, is a remake of a very popular early 70s film starring Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw in the same roles. I haven't seen the original, but I enjoyed the new version, a surprise considering I am not a huge fan of the director's MTV style of editing. In fact, Scott's editing style makes the cable network look like television from the 50s.Walter Garber (Washington), a supervisor for the New York Subway system is under investigation for taking a bribe; he has effectively been demoted and now sits at a desk making sure the system is running smoothly. Ryder (Travolta) and his crew, including Phil Ramos (Luis Guzman) jump on the Pelham 123 and quickly take control of the train, moving the passenger vehicle into a tunnel with a good vantage point. They disconnect the bulk of the train, saving the front car and it's passengers as their hostages. Ryder calls the command center and starts talking to Walter. He wants $10 million dollars for the dozen or so hostages he has on the train. They have one hour. Walter calls the police and the Mayor's (Gandolfini) office. And everyone descends on the command center. A professional New York Police Hostage negotiator (John Turturro) tries to take over, but Ryder has built a relationship with Walter, wants him back and won't talk with anyone else.Tony Scott has made his career with films that include impossibly quick editing, jarring camera moves and a frenetic pace. He almost seems to think two seconds is 1.5 seconds too long for any shot. He makes Michael Bay look like a silent film director. Why can't he let our eye, our mind spend any time on a shot trying to comprehend what is going on? If he were able to let us take in the action, our mind would help to fill in information and make everything more interesting, more dramatic, and more exciting. Because he is moving everything so quickly, it almost seems as though he doesn't want to give us that power, to think about what is going on in the film. Is he that much of an egomaniac? I think it is a little evil when a filmmaker can't let the viewer interpret anything in a film. Tony Scott is evil.In ""Pelham"", Scott keeps the pace fast, jumbles a mixture of techniques together and creates a film that is suspenseful and keeps you engaged. Okay, so maybe he isn't evil. Actually, his style seems to help this film, to a degree. For instance, when the gunmen are taking over the subway car, he spends a few moments lingering on one of the thugs and slows the film down, letting them take a few steps in slow motion. After he tires of this, he jumps the action forward and the characters are taking over the car, everything orchestrated and highly planned. This mixture of techniques helps to show us how difficult it is to get anything done in New York.Washington is good. Let's face it, he always is, it's the films that usually let him down. As Garber, he seems a little chubby, wearing a mustard yellow button down shirt and an old-fashioned tie. This is a man who has spent a lot of his career sitting down. And as we meet Garber, we realize he knows how to do his job. He moves the trains fluidly through various obstacles. He knows what to look for. He knows how to solve the problems that come up. He is a good man to have on the job when a hostage situation breaks out. But given the nature of his standing, his boss doesn't have any confidence in him. As soon as the police arrive, Walter is sent home.As soon as Ryder finds this out, he makes it known that he will only deal with Walter. This scene is probably the most effective, establishing Ryder's power and Walter's commitment to his job.Throughout the film, the two actors have to give their characters personality and build a relationship, even though they don't see each other and aren't in the same room. Washington reveals things about his character in a subtle fashion. He is a career executive and has a wife, a mortgage and two kids who are in college. Much of this is revealed as he and Ryder talk, as Ryder tries to get to know the man. Gradually, as they get to know more about each other, Ryder escalates the conversation and begins to exert control on his new friend, forcing him to reveal personal information he doesn't want to let other people know, especially his co-workers, the police and the mayor, all of whom are an audience. But he does relent because Ryder makes it impossible for him to say no.As the day progresses, we see that Walter is ultra professional and has worked his way up through the ranks. This helps him figure out what he has to do to get as many hostages to safety as possible. And he clearly has a lot invested in the workplace, making it necessary for him to do everything he can to ensure the safety of the people on the train.Travolta plays Ryder, the leader of this mission. Ryder and his men take over the train with the utmost precision. They move it to a place where they have the advantage, they keep only one car (easier to control) and do many other things which show they have an inside man. As the time ticks away, Ryder slowly becomes a little more anxious, but he never loses control. He has clearly planned every detail of this mission for months and months.As he and Walter talk, Ryder reveals more and more about his life. Travolta has played the sociopath, the flashy, over the top killer before, in roles great, amusing and way over the top (""Face/Off""), and in roles that just don't work (""Domestic Disturbance"", ""The Punisher""). He even seems to play them with relish, delighting in their more theatrical attributes. In ""Pelham"", he dials it back quite a bit which is a good thing. There is no doubt that Ryder is a sociopath because he kills a few people, but he also seems collected and clearly has a course worked out in his head. He seems to be a religious man, talking about confessionals, various passages in the bible and the like. And he seems to take a liking to Walter, insisting that the beleaguered subway official stay involved with him throughout the day, remain his contact with the outside world.It is a good performance from Travolta and compliments Washington very well.James Gandolfini plays the mayor of New York. As soon as his aides find out about the situation, they rush to a subway station and meet the Mayor's train at the platform. He gripes about taking the train, but he knows it is the quickest way to get around town. His aides quickly advise him of the situation and they take the train to the command center. Gandolfini makes a believable mayor of New York and he has a few funny lines about Rudolph Giuliani and the people of New York.John Turturro plays a hostage negotiator. It is the first of two films Turturro is featured in released three weeks apart. And both are about as different as one can get. In ""Pelham"", he is very serious, no nonsense and very matter of fact. He could easily be an actual negotiator. It's a nice performance and works well within the context of the film. In ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"", well... not so much.Luis Guzman plays Ryder's second in command and he seems to have a lot of good, useful knowledge about the subway system. As we spend more time with him, it becomes clear he is a nervous guy and not used to this sort of thing.I was convinced there would be a ""big, surprising twist"" at the end of ""Pelham"". When this didn't happen, I was happy because Scott and his writer, Brian Helgeland didn't resort to this kind of cheap storytelling trick. But on the other hand, I was a bit let down because Scott and Helgeland end the film on a more naturalistic note, a bit of a whimper rather than a bang.Scott manages to keep the tension ratcheted up and doesn't let it up until the very end. In my book, that makes for a successful thriller.",3,Washington and Travolta spar.

1276997,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002LMV7Q6,trebe,"[0, 0]","Tony Scott's update of the 1974 crime thriller, The Taking Of Pelham 123 (2009) while retaining some of the elements of the original, soon comes down to a very personal affair between stars Denzel Washington and John Travolta.  This is hardly surprising given the history of frequent collaborators Scott and Washington (Crimson Tide, Man On Fire, D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Unstoppable), and Travolta (Face/Off) makes a charismatic villain.Pelham 123, a train in New York City's subway system, is hijacked by a group of terrorists led by a man named Ryder (Travolta), who contacts the transit authority and speaks to Walter Garber (Washington) who is working as a dispatcher.  Ryder gives the city of New York one hour to come up with ten million dollars, before they will start executing hostages.  Ryder demands that Garber, rather than a police negotiator (John Tuturro), act as his liaison, and killing a man to make his point, sets the stage for the development of their unique relationship.Unlike the original, Garber is not a cop, and is given some personal baggage, as the character has been demoted to dispatcher because he is suspected of taking bribes.  This backstory provides further opportunities for the characters to interact.  The story in the original Pelham was a bit simplistic, and some of the sophisticated high-tech elements introduced in the remake, actually work quite well.  A complex financial angle makes sense, as what the criminals are really after is far more than just ten million dollars in ransom.  Played by James Gandolfini, the Mayor of New York brilliantly guesses what the terrorist's true aims may be.Ryder's band of criminals seem to approach the situation in a mostly lazy manner, and often appear to be relaxing, rather than being attuned to possible danger.  They score low for efficiently, failing to detect that the camera in passenger's laptop lying on the floor, is providing a live feed to the internet, allowing the authorities to see what is happening inside the hijacked the car, and identify some of the culprits.  Even after one of the gang is shot, the crooks remain relatively unphased.  There isn't much attention given to the passengers, who are mostly window dressing.  The remake's swing toward overdrama does become acute, when the hijackers attempt to escape, and the protagonist's one on one confrontation assumes centerstage, as Garber picks up a gun and dons his superhero cape to try and stop Ryder.Shooting action is one of Tony Scott's strengths, and that element is handled very competently.  You might expect some serious injuries when a runaway train with passengers standing up, suddenly stops, but not in this film.  And the final chase sequence and resolution is completely unbelievable, but is the kind of ending you might expect from a big studio film, where blowing away man, and then taking the subway home, is somehow credible.With a different focus and tone, this big screen remake of Pelham, is mostly a showcase for the personas of stars John Travolta and Denzel Washington, who duel over the phone, until they finally meet.  It works well enough on a superficial level, as these are talented actors who are fun to watch.  Travolta is great at playing a cartoonish madman, and the action and violence also hold your interest, but believability simply isn't a strength of this 3.5 star film.Director Tony Scott provides a kind of sporadic commentary, where he speaks about the importance of the research he did in the making of the film.  Scott doesn't consider his version a remake, and interestingly although he seems relatively familiar with the original film, he appears not to have watched it very recently.  So much for research.  It seems that humility isn't a strong point, as taking credit rather than giving it, seems to be characteristic of Scott.  Writer Brian Hegeland and producer Todd Black, provide a second much more lively commentary, that focuses more on story elements, and takes a more analytical approach, while still being interesting.  Tony Scott may have developed a fascination for trains, as he and Denzel Washington would next collaborate on Unstoppable (2010), a movie featuring a runaway train.",3,"Tony Scott's update of the 70's thriller, is a personal affair between Travolta and Washington...",1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,4201,"['Tony', 'Scott', 'update', '1974', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Taking', 'Pelham', '123', '2009', 'retaining', 'elements', 'original', 'soon', 'down', 'very', 'personal', 'affair', 'stars', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'John', 'Travolta', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'given', 'history', 'frequent', 'collaborators', 'Scott', 'Washington', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'Man', 'Fire', 'D', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'Unstoppable', 'Travolta', 'Face/Off', 'charismatic', 'villain.Pelham', '123', 'train', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'subway', 'system', 'hijacked', 'group', 'terrorists', 'led', 'man', 'named', 'Ryder', 'Travolta', 'who', 'transit', 'authority', 'speaks', 'Walter', 'Garber', 'Washington', 'who', 'working', 'dispatcher', 'Ryder', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'one', 'hour', 'come', 'up', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'will', 'start', 'executing', 'hostages', 'Ryder', 'demands', 'Garber', 'rather', 'police', 'negotiator', 'John', 'Tuturro', 'act', 'liaison', 'killing', 'man', 'make', 'point', 'stage', 'development', 'unique', 'relationship.Unlike', 'original', 'Garber', 'not', 'cop', 'given', 'personal', 'baggage', 'character', 'been', 'demoted', 'dispatcher', 'suspected', 'taking', 'bribes', 'backstory', 'further', 'opportunities', 'characters', 'interact', 'story', 'original', 'Pelham', 'was', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'sophisticated', 'high-tech', 'elements', 'introduced', 'remake', 'actually', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'complex', 'financial', 'angle', 'sense', 'what', 'criminals', 'are', 'really', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'ransom', 'Played', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Mayor', 'New', 'York', 'brilliantly', 'what', 'terrorist', 'true', 'aims', 'may', 'be.Ryder', 'band', 'criminals', 'seem', 'approach', 'situation', 'mostly', 'lazy', 'manner', 'often', 'appear', 'be', 'relaxing', 'rather', 'being', 'attuned', 'possible', 'danger', 'score', 'low', 'efficiently', 'failing', 'detect', 'camera', 'passenger', 'laptop', 'lying', 'floor', 'providing', 'live', 'feed', 'internet', 'allowing', 'authorities', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'hijacked', 'car', 'identify', 'culprits', 'Even', 'one', 'gang', 'shot', 'crooks', 'remain', 'relatively', 'unphased', ""n't"", 'much', 'attention', 'given', 'passengers', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'window', 'dressing', 'remake', 'swing', 'overdrama', 'become', 'acute', 'when', 'hijackers', 'attempt', 'escape', 'protagonist', 'one', 'one', 'confrontation', 'centerstage', 'Garber', 'up', 'gun', 'dons', 'superhero', 'cape', 'try', 'stop', 'Ryder.Shooting', 'action', 'one', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'strengths', 'element', 'handled', 'very', 'competently', 'might', 'expect', 'serious', 'injuries', 'when', 'runaway', 'train', 'passengers', 'standing', 'up', 'suddenly', 'not', 'film', 'final', 'chase', 'sequence', 'resolution', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'kind', 'ending', 'might', 'expect', 'big', 'studio', 'film', 'where', 'blowing', 'away', 'man', 'then', 'taking', 'subway', 'home', 'somehow', 'credible.With', 'different', 'focus', 'tone', 'big', 'screen', 'remake', 'Pelham', 'mostly', 'showcase', 'personas', 'stars', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'phone', 'finally', 'meet', 'well', 'enough', 'superficial', 'level', 'are', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'Travolta', 'great', 'playing', 'cartoonish', 'madman', 'action', 'violence', 'also', 'hold', 'interest', 'believability', 'simply', ""n't"", 'strength', '3.5', 'star', 'film.Director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'kind', 'sporadic', 'commentary', 'where', 'importance', 'research', 'did', 'making', 'film', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'consider', 'version', 'remake', 'interestingly', 'relatively', 'familiar', 'original', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'watched', 'very', 'recently', 'So', 'much', 'research', 'humility', ""n't"", 'strong', 'point', 'taking', 'credit', 'rather', 'giving', 'be', 'characteristic', 'Scott', 'Writer', 'Brian', 'Hegeland', 'producer', 'Todd', 'Black', 'provide', 'second', 'much', 'more', 'lively', 'commentary', 'more', 'story', 'elements', 'more', 'analytical', 'approach', 'still', 'being', 'interesting', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'may', 'have', 'developed', 'fascination', 'trains', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'would', 'next', 'collaborate', 'Unstoppable', '2010', 'movie', 'featuring', 'runaway', 'train']",N/A

1277004,A24JDJQWQDDH14,B002LMV7Q6,Yu Narukami,"[1, 1]","I am a big fan of the original Pelham 123 film, and I just had to see this remake. Given that I am a New Yorker, I enjoyed this film so much that I saw twice in the movies, and bought it on dvd the second it was released. So you are probably asking me, why on earth would I deduct two stars from the rating system? I will explain as I go further into my review.The quality and filming style of the film is a visionary perception of Tony Scott's idea of a great film. The script was good, but it has its flaws. When I say flaws, I mean geographical mistakes! First of all, every New Yorker knows that the 6 train goes no where near Coney Island. When the police pick up the money from the Federal Reserve, they are actually at the Federal Building/Post Office on Church Street, near the Trade Center. When the train is going really fast, you see a quick shot of Shea Stadium (blue facade showing a gate). Shea Stadium was located in Queens (it was demolished before the film's release), and the 6 line does not enter Queens at any point along the line. You also see a quick shot of it passing a 7 train which is the Flushing Line train that runs to Shea Stadium. The hijackers make their escape through a secret tunnel connecting the NYC subway system to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and this occurs around 33rd St. In fact, the Waldorf-Astoria is between 49th and 50th Sts; moreover, there is no such tunnel, although there is a tunnel connecting the Metro North Park Avenue train tunnel (not part of the NYC subway system) to the Waldorf-Astoria. The hijacked subway car is operated several times by a person sitting on the left hand side of the operating cab. All NYC subway cars are operated from the right side. When the conductor is watching the passengers get on and off, she is in the 5th car. All conductors are always in the 6th car. NYPD Motor Division officers are shown riding BMW R1100 bikes. The NYPD Motor Division has used Harley Davidson Electra Glide/FL bikes exclusively since 1955. On the bridge to Brooklyn Garber walks through subway tracks and onto the pedestrian area of the bridge through an unlocked gate to get to Ryder. In reality this would be locked by a chain and padlock.So those are the obvious mistakes found in the film, one other issue, the biggest issue with the film, in my personal opinion, John Travolta. For starters, the relentless use of the ""F"" word is just plain rediculous, not only that, but it is also the WAY Travolta says it, his deliveries are really really bad! Another issue regarding John Travolta, are the unneeded homosexuality references. Don't get me wrong, I myself am bi-sexual, so I have nothing against homosexuality, but it is unnessecary and irrelevent to the plot, and character development of the film. Don't get me wrong, I like John Travolta as an actor, but this just wasn't for him.To the good sides, Denzel Washington gives his fullest to fulfill the role of Walter Mathau. Notice how they changed Garber's first name from Zack to Walter in the remake, I find that really cool. Denzel is convincing in his lines throughout the film. I believe Tony Scott and Denzel were great friends, simply because this is the third film Denzel has starred in with Tony Scott. I think the person who stands out even more in the film is John Tuturro, the look in his eyes after Ryder kills the motorman was well acted. James Gandolfini as the mayor was a very good choice, he did a great job controlling the scene and had charisma. Garber's wife was a sweet actress, ""You do what you have to do, but we need milk, so on your way home I want you to bring a gallon."" I wanted to cry when I heard that line. Phil Ramos was more convincing that John Travolta, in my opinion. Sorry but Travolta just wasn't convincing enough for me. One thing I did like about Travolta and Denzel together was the chemistry between one another.The action sequences were loaded with fun and excitement. The only problem I had was the fact that Garber went to go chase Ryder in the end with a gun, he would never be allowed to do that, and why would he do something like that anyway? I did really like how Garber shot Ryder, and Ryder's words were, ""You're my god damn hero."" That was the one powerful line made by Travolta in the film. The police crash with the motorcycles was well shot.The score for the film is so addicting. I love how they put 99 problems in the beginning of the film. I also like the police chase theme song, I don't know the name of it, but I really like it.To conclude this, I really like this film alot, despite John Travolta and the geographical mistakes. Is it as good as the original film? No, Robert Shaw is the man! The original is also much more accurate geographical wise. Tony Scott knew that he could not beat the original ending, so he changed it. The ending was good, just not as good as the original. I recommend you see the film, despite the mistakes.",3,Ruined by John Travolta,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,4919,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Pelham', '123', 'film', 'just', 'had', 'see',

1277005,AP3B615GM191G,B002LMV7Q6,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[7, 8]","By and large, the types of films that Denzel Washington sticks his name on provide viewers with incredible acting, great character development, and a plot that sucks you in and makes you really care about what is going on.  Unfortunately, ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" does absolutely none of those things.Acting: The film focuses on Washington's ""good guy"" (a New York subway line coordinator) matching wits with John Travolta's ""bad guy"" (who hijacks a subway car in exchange for a large ransom).  However, neither of them are able to act anywhere near their full potential.  Whereas Denzel is at his best when his passions/convictions get the best of him, in this movie he is not once allowed to emote wildly.  Instead, he turns in a ho-hum performance where he stays cool, calm, and in control the entire time.  While that may have been the character that was written on the page, it didn't suit Washington at all and thus should have been cast differently.  As for Travolta, he is too busy dropping F-bombs and maniacally raving to really be allowed any sort of acting maneuvering.  His character is the same from the first time that we see him until the last.Plot: Though hyped up to be an incredible, fast-paced film, the plot really is no different than anything that has been done a thousand times before.  Crime, hostages, ransom, banter, rescue attempt.  That's all it really boiled down to, and those same themes were covered in much more riveting fashion in mere minutes of, say, ""The Siege"" (another, much better, Washington film).Character Development: This area was easily the biggest weakness of the film.  Though it seems as if, in the beginning, the film is moving towards some interesting developments for both the Washington and Travolta characters, the ""revelations"" come and go in seconds and are never touched upon again.  It's as if the writers had some good ideas in mind, but never really got everything ironed out.Also odd was the strange dialogues throughout the film.  At times, in the middle of what should have been a tense hostage crisis, Washington (or his co-workers/superiors) were often seen laughing or joking with each other in a fashion that didn't at all seem to fit the tense mood of the film.  I kept expecting the tension to pick up as the minutes ticked by, but before I knew it the movie was over and it seemed as if nothing substantial had happened.Thus, despite my liking of most films starring Denzel Washington, I would have to steer other viewers clear of this one.  The plot is shallow, the acting isn't anywhere near fully realized, and the character development/dialogues are just plain stupid or non-existent.  I have not seen the original version of ""Pelham"", but I'm willing to bet that this remake didn't live up to it.",2,Fails On Almost Every Level,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,2774,"['large', 'types', 'films', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'name', 'provide', 'viewers', 'incredible', 'acting', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'going', 'Unfortunately', 'Taking', 'Pelham', '123', 'absolutely', 'none', 'things.Acting', 'film', 'Washington', 'good', 'guy', 'New', 'York', 'subway', 'line', 'coordinator', 'matching', 'wits', 'John', 'Travolta', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'subway', 'car', 'exchange', 'large', 'ransom', 'However', 'are', 'able', 'act', 'anywhere', 'full', 'potential', 'Whereas', 'Denzel', 'best', 'when', 'passions/convictions', 'get', 'best', 'movie', 'not', 'once', 'allowed', 'emote', 'wildly', 'Instead', 'ho-hum', 'performance', 'where', 'cool', 'calm', 'control', 'entire', 'time', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'page', 'did', ""n't"", 'suit', 'Washington', 'thus', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'differently', 'Travolta', 'too', 'busy', 'dropping', 'F-bombs', 'maniacally', 'raving', 'really', 'be', 'allowed', 'sort', 'acting', 'maneuvering', 'character', 'same', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'last.Plot', 'hyped', 'up', 'be', 'incredible', 'fast-paced', 'film', 'plot', 'really', 'different', 'anything', 'been', 'done', 'thousand', 'times', 'before', 'Crime', 'hostages', 'ransom', 'banter', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'really', 'boiled', 'down', 'same', 'themes', 'were', 'covered', 'much', 'more', 'riveting', 'fashion', 'mere', 'minutes', 'say', 'Siege', 'much', 'better', 'Washington', 'film', '.Character', 'Development', 'area', 'was', 'easily', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'film', 'beginning', 'film', 'moving', 'interesting', 'developments', 'Washington', 'Travolta', 'characters', 'revelations', 'come', 'go', 'seconds', 'are', 'never', 'touched', 'upon', 'again', 'writers', 'had', 'good', 'ideas', 'mind', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'everything', 'ironed', 'odd', 'was', 'strange', 'dialogues', 'film', 'times', 'middle', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tense', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'Washington', 'co-workers/superiors', 'were', 'often', 'seen', 'laughing', 'joking', 'other', 'fashion', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'tense', 'mood', 'film', 'kept', 'expecting', 'tension', 'pick', 'up', 'minutes', 'ticked', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'seemed', 'nothing', 'substantial', 'had', 'happened.Thus', 'liking', 'most', 'films', 'starring', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'would', 'have', 'steer', 'other', 'viewers', 'clear', 'one', 'plot', 'shallow', 'acting', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'fully', 'realized', 'character', 'development/dialogues', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'non-existent', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'version', 'Pelham', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'remake', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up']",N/A
