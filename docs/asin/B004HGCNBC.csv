1408246,A24PTVSZSM8968,B004HGCNBC,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed the book this movie is based on when it first came out many years after Hemingway's death. In many ways, the movie is very true to the book. The locales are pretty much just right and the dialog seems very Hemingwayesque at many points. However, there's something missing at the same time. Supposedly the book was chopped down from the original manuscript fragment Hemingway left, and undoubtedly, this movie was chopped down from the book. It's almost as if you get the perfect taste of Hemingway without the full impact. The characters are right in many ways, but the development of them is a bit abrupt. I also feel like some of the secondary characters were short-changed a bit due to lack of space to develop them in a movie format. Finally, while everything about the movie seemed to be from the real Hemingway universe, Hemingway comes off as very one-dimensional and behind the times. In spite of the very provocative nature of the human relationships in the movie, in the end, it's still a male-dominated world in which the guy ends up being the focal point and the winner. Most fans of Hemingway will want to check this movie out, but for some, it may leave them wishing it had been about twice as long in order to better develop the  characters.",4,Great movie that's not so great,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,1273,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'many', 'years', 'Hemingway', 'death', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'very', 'true', 'book', 'locales', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'right', 'dialog', 'very', 'Hemingwayesque', 'many', 'points', 'However', 'something', 'missing', 'same', 'time', 'Supposedly', 'book', 'was', 'chopped', 'down', 'original', 'manuscript', 'fragment', 'Hemingway', 'left', 'undoubtedly', 'movie', 'was', 'chopped', 'down', 'book', 'almost', 'get', 'perfect', 'taste', 'Hemingway', 'full', 'impact', 'characters', 'are', 'right', 'many', 'ways', 'development', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'also', 'feel', 'secondary', 'characters', 'were', 'short-changed', 'bit', 'due', 'lack', 'space', 'develop', 'movie', 'format', 'Finally', 'everything', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'real', 'Hemingway', 'universe', 'Hemingway', 'off', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'times', 'spite', 'very', 'provocative', 'nature', 'human', 'relationships', 'movie', 'end', 'still', 'male-dominated', 'world', 'guy', 'up', 'being', 'focal', 'point', 'winner', 'Most', 'fans', 'Hemingway', 'will', 'want', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'may', 'leave', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'about', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'order', 'better', 'develop', 'characters']",Hemingway's Garden Of Eden

Here, Catherine/Devil is just one-dimensional and scary.  (Why would anybody bother with her, let alone fall in love with her?) In the book, however, as I recall it, she's complex; her character unfolds gradually.  Plus you're equally aware of Hemingway's misogyny and fear of women.

1408250,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,B004HGCNBC,bunnyrabbit4,"[21, 23]","The Hemingway novel, Garden of Eden, was not published until after his death. It was an unfinished exploration into gender issues. The movie fails to capture this spirit of exploration and relies mostly on three beautiful bodies and faces to carry us past the contrivances of one character, Catherine. She seems to express her mean spirited alcoholism much better than her sexuality. As in the book, Catherine becomes the wife of David, a thinly disguised stand in for Hemingway. Their courtship is much too short, and their marriage equally so due to Catherine's insistence that they both sleep with a woman she meets called Marita.If Catherine had been allowed to have a passionate side this movie might have worked. Instead she comes across as a cold, controlling manipulator who treats people like puppets she has purchased. Rather than being passionate about her sexuality, she spends the film acting out various skits with her puppets while drinking too much. After a few of these skits she takes the name ""Devil"", which fits all too well. David's response to this is at times puzzling because he doesn't come across as being as passionate about his writing as he is about the reviews on his first book. He rebuts her insults but does not treat them as the attacks on his writer persona that they obviously are. Until he writes a story about his father, which Catherine savages, his writing isn't really the film's focus. Catherine's whims control everything.Marita's character is a bit puzzling as she doesn't seem to have any real affection for Catherine and appears from the onset to be more interested in David, even though she is supposed to be the lesbian. In fact if all lesbians were like Marita, straight women wouldn't have a chance! Like Catherine, she is uber rich and could buy and sell David as she wishes. But we quickly learn that she has enough emotional depth to understand both the man and his writing. At that point the movie became very unbelievable for me. It is all too obvious that the only possible resolution is for him to leave Catherine before she finishes destroying him.While very easy to watch, due mostly to the beautiful scenery, close-ups, costuming and hairstyles, this film fails to convey anything about Hemingway's ideas on gender. It is much more about the musings of a one-dimensional, idle, rich girl. A scene at the end of the movie where Catherine meets a character called the Colonel who was introduced earlier in the film, is to me the most thought provoking part of the movie. As the story begins there is a scene where the Colonel meets Catherine for what is supposedly the first time and tells a story about seeing her starring at a painting of a women in the Louvre. He then tells David to hold her close,""very close."" He also says he knew her father, a ""shy"" man and insinuates that she too is ""shy"".There seems to be a kind of double talk going on that intrigues the viewer, but it is quickly left behind as the plot dashes forward into a series of superficial interactions between David and Catherine. They are sexually passionate, but again it is a visual passion broken up by Catherines odd verbal insertions. At the end of the film she is seen meeting the Colonel again and he immediately says there is a woman she must meet, confirming that the initial conversation was indeed about her being gay and not ""shy"". Even though little is said, these two scenes make Catherine's character intriguing, because they allow the audience to think. The steady diet of evil machinations that comprise most of the film discourage this kind of thinking. Sadly, the audience quickly learns just to watch.",3,"High on Visuals, Low on Intrique..",1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,3651,"['Hemingway', 'novel', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'was', 'not', 'published', 'death', 'was', 'unfinished', 'exploration', 'gender', 'issues', 'movie', 'capture', 'spirit', 'exploration', 'relies', 'mostly', 'three', 'beautiful', 'bodies', 'carry', 'contrivances', 'one', 'character', 'Catherine', 'express', 'mean', 'spirited', 'alcoholism', 'much', 'better', 'sexuality', 'book', 'Catherine', 'wife', 'David', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'stand', 'Hemingway', 'courtship', 'much', 'too', 'short', 'marriage', 'equally', 'so', 'due', 'Catherine', 'insistence', 'sleep', 'woman', 'called', 'Marita.If', 'Catherine', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'have', 'passionate', 'side', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'Instead', 'across', 'cold', 'controlling', 'manipulator', 'who', 'people', 'puppets', 'purchased', 'Rather', 'being', 'passionate', 'sexuality', 'film', 'acting', 'out', 'various', 'skits', 'puppets', 'drinking', 'too', 'much', 'few', 'skits', 'name', 'Devil', 'too', 'well', 'David', 'response', 'times', 'puzzling', ""n't"", 'come', 'as', 'being', 'passionate', 'writing', 'reviews', 'first', 'book', 'insults', 'not', 'treat', 'attacks', 'writer', 'persona', 'obviously', 'are', 'story', 'father', 'Catherine', 'savages', 'writing', ""n't"", 'really', 'film', 'focus', 'Catherine', 'whims', 'control', 'everything.Marita', 'character', 'bit', 'puzzling', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'real', 'affection', 'Catherine', 'onset', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'David', 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'lesbian', 'fact', 'lesbians', 'were', 'Marita', 'straight', 'women', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'Catherine', 'uber', 'rich', 'could', 'buy', 'sell', 'David', 'quickly', 'learn', 'enough', 'emotional', 'depth', 'understand', 'man', 'writing', 'point', 'movie', 'became', 'very', 'unbelievable', 'too', 'obvious', 'only', 'possible', 'resolution', 'leave', 'Catherine', 'destroying', 'him.While', 'very', 'easy', 'watch', 'due', 'mostly', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'close-ups', 'costuming', 'hairstyles', 'film', 'convey', 'anything', 'Hemingway', 'ideas', 'gender', 'much', 'more', 'musings', 'one-dimensional', 'idle', 'rich', 'girl', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'Catherine', 'character', 'called', 'Colonel', 'who', 'was', 'introduced', 'earlier', 'film', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'part', 'movie', 'story', 'scene', 'where', 'Colonel', 'meets', 'Catherine', 'what', 'supposedly', 'first', 'time', 'story', 'seeing', 'starring', 'painting', 'women', 'Louvre', 'then', 'David', 'hold', 'close', 'very', 'close', 'also', 'knew', 'father', 'shy', 'man', 'too', 'shy', '.There', 'be', 'kind', 'double', 'talk', 'going', 'viewer', 'quickly', 'left', 'behind', 'plot', 'forward', 'series', 'superficial', 'interactions', 'David', 'Catherine', 'are', 'sexually', 'passionate', 'again', 'visual', 'passion', 'broken', 'up', 'Catherines', 'odd', 'verbal', 'insertions', 'end', 'film', 'seen', 'meeting', 'Colonel', 'again', 'immediately', 'woman', 'must', 'meet', 'confirming', 'initial', 'conversation', 'was', 'indeed', 'being', 'gay', 'not', 'shy', 'Even', 'little', 'said', 'two', 'scenes', 'make', 'Catherine', 'character', 'intriguing', 'allow', 'audience', 'think', 'steady', 'diet', 'evil', 'machinations', 'comprise', 'most', 'film', 'discourage', 'kind', 'thinking', 'Sadly', 'audience', 'quickly', 'just', 'watch']",Hemingway's Garden Of Eden

1408254,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B004HGCNBC,Doug Anderson,"[79, 83]","I saw this film in December of 2010, and I wondered why it wasn't on anyone's Best of 2010 list because I really thought it was the best thing that I saw all year (and I see a lot of movies). Now I see that the reason no one mentioned it was because it was released in 2008 (although I never heard it mentioned until this years 2010 NYTimes Fall/Winter Preview edition mentioned it as if it were a new release).Suffice it to say that this adaptation is perhaps more whimsical in tone than is Hemingway's posthumously published work Garden of Eden (every moment Richard Grant is on screen is going to have a measure of whimsy) but even with a dose or two of comic relief, this is pretty heady & pretty steamy stuff.Jack K. Huston (unknown to me before seeing this film) plays a twenty-something Hemingway-ish writer living a splendidly bohemian low rent ex-pat existence in Paris until he meets a wealthy American (Mena Suvari) on a kind of art buying holiday. Once these two meet, the young ""Hemingway"" is introduced to the finer things in life (new sports car, new clothes, expensive restaurants & chalets) but also to a more decadent side of life (as it turns out that his new bride is a bi-sexual gender-bending adventurer). At first the young writer goes along with his flirty new brides games and even dyes his hair blonde to match hers (which gets shorter & shorter & more boyish as the film progresses).  But when these platinum blonde twins invite a third to play in their love games, a struggle for creative control over the relationship ensues.The struggle over sexual/gender identity & over the authorship or direction of the relationship is fascinating to watch, and the couple's beautiful Spanish companion is really something to see as she sheds her suit & bathes au natural in the cool Mediterannean sea that provides the stunning backdrop to this impossibly lush & lascivious ""eden"". In addition to dealing with a complex & often tyrannical wife, and a complex love triangle/power struggle, the young writer is also working through the central event of his youth which occurred while hunting with his father in Africa. The film thus becomes a kind of double initiation into manhood (and each initiation sheds a subtle light on the other).This is one of those films that deserves to be seen not only by Hemingway admirers but by anyone interested in complex characters & plots. There's nothing overly literary about this adaptation, rather it plays like a really good mystery that slowly unfolds and slowly reveals the complex psychological events & experiences that shape character's & provide them with a sense of self, as well as with a motivation & purpose.If the film has a weakness, it's that we are never afforded any insight into the very sophisticated, very complex, but also very conflicted wife; nor any insight into the Spanish beauty who is never more than a phantom, an edenic creature, a vision of physical perfection. But then part of the reason the film works is because it is about the spell these women cast over the young writer, and part of that spell is their mystery.Highly recommended!!!!!",5,desire & creativity,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,3128,"['saw', 'film', 'December', '2010', 'wondered', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'Best', '2010', 'list', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'saw', 'year', 'see', 'lot', 'movies', 'Now', 'see', 'reason', 'one', 'mentioned', 'was', 'was', 'released', '2008', 'never', 'heard', 'mentioned', 'years', '2010', 'NYTimes', 'Fall/Winter', 'Preview', 'edition', 'mentioned', 'were', 'new', 'release', 'say', 'adaptation', 'perhaps', 'more', 'whimsical', 'tone', 'Hemingway', 'posthumously', 'published', 'work', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'moment', 'Richard', 'Grant', 'screen', 'going', 'have', 'measure', 'whimsy', 'even', 'dose', 'two', 'comic', 'relief', 'pretty', 'heady', 'pretty', 'steamy', 'stuff.Jack', 'K.', 'Huston', 'unknown', 'seeing', 'film', 'twenty-something', 'Hemingway-ish', 'writer', 'living', 'splendidly', 'bohemian', 'low', 'rent', 'ex-pat', 'existence', 'Paris', 'wealthy', 'American', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'kind', 'art', 'buying', 'holiday', 'two', 'meet', 'young', 'Hemingway', 'introduced', 'finer', 'things', 'life', 'new', 'sports', 'car', 'new', 'clothes', 'expensive', 'restaurants', 'chalets', 'also', 'more', 'decadent', 'side', 'life', 'out', 'new', 'bride', 'bi-sexual', 'gender-bending', 'adventurer', 'first', 'young', 'writer', 'flirty', 'new', 'brides', 'games', 'even', 'dyes', 'hair', 'blonde', 'match', 'hers', 'shorter', 'shorter', 'more', 'boyish', 'film', 'when', 'platinum', 'blonde', 'twins', 'invite', 'third', 'play', 'love', 'games', 'struggle', 'creative', 'control', 'relationship', 'ensues.The', 'struggle', 'sexual/gender', 'identity', 'authorship', 'direction', 'relationship', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'couple', 'beautiful', 'Spanish', 'companion', 'really', 'something', 'see', 'suit', 'bathes', 'au', 'natural', 'cool', 'Mediterannean', 'sea', 'stunning', 'backdrop', 'impossibly', 'lush', 'lascivious', 'eden', 'addition', 'dealing', 'complex', 'often', 'tyrannical', 'wife', 'complex', 'love', 'triangle/power', 'struggle', 'young', 'writer', 'also', 'working', 'central', 'event', 'youth', 'occurred', 'hunting', 'father', 'Africa', 'film', 'thus', 'kind', 'double', 'initiation', 'manhood', 'initiation', 'subtle', 'light', 'other', '.This', 'one', 'films', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'only', 'Hemingway', 'admirers', 'anyone', 'interested', 'complex', 'characters', 'plots', 'nothing', 'overly', 'literary', 'adaptation', 'rather', 'really', 'good', 'mystery', 'slowly', 'unfolds', 'slowly', 'reveals', 'complex', 'psychological', 'events', 'experiences', 'shape', 'character', 'provide', 'sense', 'self', 'as', 'well', 'motivation', 'purpose.If', 'film', 'weakness', 'are', 'never', 'afforded', 'insight', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'very', 'complex', 'also', 'very', 'conflicted', 'wife', 'insight', 'Spanish', 'beauty', 'who', 'never', 'more', 'phantom', 'edenic', 'creature', 'vision', 'physical', 'perfection', 'then', 'part', 'reason', 'film', 'spell', 'women', 'cast', 'young', 'writer', 'part', 'spell', 'mystery.Highly', 'recommended']",Hemingway's Garden Of Eden

Levic,"[1, 1]","I had never heard of Hemingway's GARDEN OF EDEN and just learned it was a book he worked on for years and it was not published until 1986--long after his death. The main draw of this film is three stunningly beautiful actors in stunningly beautiful scenery. The film is worth a look if only for the actors and the scenery. Although there are a few scenes in other parts of Europe, most of the story takes place on the French Rivera and you can't get much beautiful scenery that that.American writer David Bourne falls in love with wealthy Catherine and they quickly marry. At first their relationship seems perfect until Catherine's emotional and sexual confusion come into play along with her jealousy of David's writing career. Enter the exotically beautiful Marita and the relationship of David and Catherine embarks on a journey of no return. Catherine all but forces David and Marita together. Catherine's insecurities overwhelm her.There is an interesting side story of David's childhood on an elephant safari with his father. It's a little insight into his character though we know very little about Catherine's childhood other than the tragic murder suicide of her parents.Spanish actress Carmen Maura and British actor Richard Grant have small roles in the film and their talents are underused. It even seemed odd that two well known actors would be secondary characters in this film.The main theme of this movie seems to be the problems of bringing a third person into a marriage.

Seems to pretty much put him down for his writing - something that's important to him and she mostly allows or tolerates.Eventually she runs into another rich and beautiful young woman with dark hair who seems to be bisexual and attracted to her and her husband both. The wife tells the husband he can have this other woman too. At the end of the movie, the wife takes off and the husband is now going to play house with this other rich woman with the dark hair.There is pretty much NO PERSONALITY to any of the characters, not much in the way of dialogue or activity. No point to this story.  The only reason I can maybe see this story being famous is PERHAPS that at the time it was written there wasn't much erotica out there. That's really all this story has to offer and it's not much.",2,boring story with some porn thrown in,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,1088,"['Wow', 'what', 'horribly', 'BORING', 'story', 'very', 'odd', 'somewhat', 'perverted', 'rich', 'boring', 'female', 'handsome', 'writer', 'Has', 'sex', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'keeps', 'cutting', 'hair', 'Pretty', 'much', 'off', 'shock', 'value', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'nothing', 'else', 'personality', 'really', 'Seems', 'pretty', 'much', 'down', 'writing', 'something', 'important', 'mostly', 'tolerates.Eventually', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'dark', 'hair', 'who', 'be', 'bisexual', 'attracted', 'husband', 'wife', 'husband', 'can', 'have', 'other', 'woman', 'too', 'end', 'movie', 'wife', 'husband', 'now', 'going', 'play', 'house', 'other', 'rich', 'woman', 'dark', 'pretty', 'much', 'NO', 'PERSONALITY', 'characters', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'dialogue', 'activity', 'point', 'story', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'maybe', 'see', 'story', 'being', 'famous', 'PERHAPS', 'time', 'was', 'written', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'erotica', 'there', 'really', 'story', 'offer', 'not', 'much']",Hemingway's Garden Of Eden

Not always the best acted, but the actors do their part and then some.  It's a little overstated here and there, but still competent in the thesping.I'm not sure I really get the whole point of the story, other than Hemingway's character wanted the vicious bad girl to love him and like him, but wound up falling in love with the caring girl.I'd not seen the film before, so this is my first exposure to it.  It seemed marginally racy for what it was supposed to be, but it did well all the same.  I'm not sure the sex scenes were really neccesary, and I think a few more intimate emotional moments might have served this piece a bit better, but all in all it works.I guess I liked it for what it was, but I'm not a big of the film.A young writer finishes off trench warfare and goes to write in the Mediterranean, where he finds lust and love in the form of two women.
