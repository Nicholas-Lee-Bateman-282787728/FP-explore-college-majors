764713,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0000AM6J0,C. O. DeRiemer,"[17, 17]","This is a movie that comes so close to being a first-rate thriller that it's disappointing when it misses. It still is a good, hard-edged story, thanks to Morgan Freeman as Leo Smalls, Jr., aka Fast Black, a domineering, charismatic and vicious New York pimp.Christopher Reeve stars as Jonathan Fisher, a magazine writer who to meet a deadline fakes a story about tough street life and the women and pimps who work it. His main character is just as phoney as the rest of the story, but the article creates a sensation. The DA thinks the pimp in the story is really Fast Black, who is on trial for murder. He wants Fisher's notes, but, of course, Fisher doesn't have any. And then Fast Black, out on bail, sees an opportunity. At first he thinks someone has been talking about him to Fisher and wants to know who. But then he'll show Fisher real street life and verify that he was the character, saving Fisher from journalistic disgrace...but Fisher has to give him an alibi. The story plays out partly through Fisher's squirming attempts to get out of his fix and partly through Fast Black's ruthlessness.The movie is dominated by Freeman's performance as Fast Black. Fast is a product of the streets, who has survived and flourished because he is ruthless and smart. He can turn violent in an instant, but you're never sure if he's actually lost control. He can be charming and even fascinating. Part of Fisher's problem is that being accepted by Fast Black is a little like being on a drug.Morgan Freeman over the last few years seems to be the one directors go to when they want world-weary wisdom (Unforgiven, Shawshank, Million Dollar Baby, many others). He can do this kind of stuff with his eyes shut. His turn as a completely believeable, charming, vicious pimp is something to see.The movie feaures some other strong performances. Kathy Baker plays Punchy, one of Fast Black's prostitutes who befriends Fisher. She still has a few ounces of self respect, and seeing Fast Black terrorize her is not pretty. Andre Gregory plays Fisher's magazine publisher and steals every scene he's in. Shari Hilton as Darlene, another of Fast Black's women, and Erik King as Reggie, Fast Black's muscle and go-fer, make strong impressions.However, the movie has two weaknesses. Fast Black's story and Fisher's story never quite come together. And Reeve simply doesn't dominate the movie the way his character should. His moral conflict seems more yuppie angst.Even so, this is a good movie with a first-rate performance. The DVD transfer looks good and there are no extras to speak of.",4,"Great Morgan Freeman, Good Movie",1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,2578,"['movie', 'so', 'close', 'being', 'first-rate', 'thriller', 'disappointing', 'when', 'still', 'good', 'hard-edged', 'story', 'thanks', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Leo', 'Smalls', 'Jr.', 'aka', 'Fast', 'Black', 'domineering', 'charismatic', 'vicious', 'New', 'York', 'pimp.Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Jonathan', 'Fisher', 'magazine', 'writer', 'who', 'meet', 'deadline', 'story', 'tough', 'street', 'life', 'women', 'pimps', 'who', 'work', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'as', 'phoney', 'rest', 'story', 'article', 'sensation', 'DA', 'pimp', 'story', 'really', 'Fast', 'Black', 'who', 'trial', 'murder', 'Fisher', 'notes', 'course', 'Fisher', ""n't"", 'have', 'then', 'Fast', 'Black', 'bail', 'opportunity', 'first', 'someone', 'been', 'talking', 'Fisher', 'know', 'who', 'then', ""'ll"", 'show', 'Fisher', 'real', 'street', 'life', 'verify', 'was', 'character', 'saving', 'Fisher', 'journalistic', 'disgrace', 'Fisher', 'give', 'alibi', 'story', 'out', 'partly', 'Fisher', 'squirming', 'attempts', 'get', 'fix', 'partly', 'Fast', 'Black', 'ruthlessness.The', 'movie', 'dominated', 'Freeman', 'performance', 'Fast', 'Black', 'Fast', 'product', 'streets', 'who', 'survived', 'flourished', 'ruthless', 'smart', 'can', 'turn', 'violent', 'instant', ""'re"", 'never', 'sure', 'actually', 'lost', 'control', 'can', 'be', 'charming', 'even', 'fascinating', 'Part', 'Fisher', 'problem', 'being', 'accepted', 'Fast', 'Black', 'little', 'being', 'drug.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'be', 'one', 'directors', 'go', 'when', 'want', 'world-weary', 'wisdom', 'Unforgiven', 'Shawshank', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'many', 'others', 'can', 'do', 'kind', 'stuff', 'eyes', 'shut', 'turn', 'completely', 'believeable', 'charming', 'vicious', 'pimp', 'something', 'see.The', 'movie', 'feaures', 'other', 'strong', 'performances', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Punchy', 'one', 'Fast', 'Black', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'Fisher', 'still', 'few', 'ounces', 'self', 'respect', 'seeing', 'Fast', 'Black', 'terrorize', 'not', 'pretty', 'Andre', 'Gregory', 'Fisher', 'magazine', 'publisher', 'steals', 'scene', 'Shari', 'Hilton', 'Darlene', 'Fast', 'Black', 'women', 'Erik', 'King', 'Reggie', 'Fast', 'Black', 'muscle', 'go-fer', 'make', 'strong', 'impressions.However', 'movie', 'two', 'weaknesses', 'Fast', 'Black', 'story', 'Fisher', 'story', 'never', 'quite', 'come', 'together', 'Reeve', 'simply', ""n't"", 'dominate', 'movie', 'way', 'character', 'should', 'moral', 'conflict', 'more', 'yuppie', 'angst.Even', 'so', 'good', 'movie', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'good', 'are', 'extras', 'speak']",N/A

The movie is not helped by it's lackluster direction and movie-of-the-week storytelling.  Reeve was more convincing as a journalist when he was playing Clark Kent.

764717,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0000AM6J0,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 5]","Now and then it's fun to review a film just because it is so confusing and uneven. STREET SMART is one of those. Dated 1986 (I do not know why it is erroneously listed as 1987 release, I recall it when it came out and that was 1986), it's Wallywood at its finest (by way of Golan Globus Productions).Consider firstly what was hot and truly smoking in 1986:Aliens.Big Trouble In Little China.Blue Velvet.Children Of A Lesser God.Crocodile Dundee.A Room With A View. Tough year to compete.1987, just for 'official release date' sake, was no easier on the competition:Full Metal Jacket [HD].Moonstruck.Robocop. I could go on and on in either year, and we're looking too at the beginnings of franchises, as with ALIENS and ROBOCOP. The film under review here started no franchise.Here we have a seemingly quiet, rather blundering film, poorly paced and terribly shot. Magazine column writer Jonathan Fisher (Christopher Reeve) fabricates a story about a day in the life of a pimp, in order to jump-start his sagging career (reminded me of this film). Bear in mind, at this time Reeve had 3 SUPERMAN films behind him, with the 4th (and 5th, wasn't there a 5th?) on the way ~ and he was considered one of the sexiest men, a super-rising star.So, Jon writes about the fictional ""Tyrone"" and is a huge hit. Jon gets his own ""reality"" TV show called ""Street Smart"" ~ shades of ""COPS"" and ""Candid Camera"". Then he comes to the attention of a genuine and evil pimp, Leo ""Fast Black"" Smalls (Morgan Freeman in his 1st role).Now, bear in mind Freeman was virtually a nobody though already a recognized and beloved actor (I was very familiar with him because I loved him in ""The Electric Company"", so sue me). Everything good, and I mean everything, was ahead of Freeman at this point. It was apparently his honor to costar with Reeve. As the evil pimp Fast Black, Freeman shines. He is involved with a john when the john dies of a heart attack, but Fast Black is charged with 2nd degree murder for it.His lawyer is convinced that if Fast Black meets with Jon and colludes, he may be acquitted. What follows is an ugly cat-and-mouse on the streets of New York, with Jon refusing to talk about his part in/knowledge of his faked story about a crime lord. Fast Black pursues him and even has Jon's girlfriend stabbed (she survives). In the end, Jon does some brave, quick thinking and Fast Black gets shot down by his own man.Then Jon promptly and cynically covers the murder for his ""Street Smart"" TV segment.This film in some weird way reminds me of Tyler Perry'sTyler Perry's Madea Goes To Jail... and may have inspired it. I wonder if Stephen Glass (of Shattered Glass fame) got his idea to invent stories from this film. It is ahead of its time, with clean rather than gritty shots (of Quebec as stand-in for NYC, quite a shock to see that kind of substitution this early).The idea of an all-jazz soundtrack was also brilliant. It was ahead of its time with the concept of a reality TV program showing crime on the streets and street life in general. The real thing wouldn't really hit the public until a bit later, in the form of ""COPS"". And by the way, Freeman was so intense and convincing that the actress Fast Black menaces with scissors says she thought Freeman was really going to cut her ~ and I think he did accidentally nick her cheek.This film was a mini-Who's Who of bit players who later got famous: Kathy Baker, Mimi Rogers, Erik King and several others who have remained prominent but nameless character actors. The cinematography is 1/2 slick and 1/2 sick, but the sound is dreadful and some of the pick-up (looping) is patently absurd. Several shots show actors with mouths and faces completely immobile, yet they have lines which are spoken, sloppily looped-in at a later date.Continuity is a real problem here too: in one scene Freeman's moustache has altered significantly; in the beginning, someone inexplicably calls Reeve ""Joe"" (his name's Jonathan, remember?) Near the end, Jon calls in a favor from a prostitute ~ trouble is we have no idea what that original favor might have been (SEE UPDATE BELOW), or who the mystery prostitute is supposed to be. After she agrees to help Jon, she tells him, ""We're even.""So we are. This film seems uneven and unsure of itself. It presents itself at the beginning as almost a comedy. It looks as if it will be funny, or employ gallows humor at least. Not at all. It turns ugly and overly dramatic in a few seconds' screen time; it cannot balance itself properly after that. Nonetheless, it is 1/2 B-movie and 1/2 genius. I'd get it for that alone. It definitely started many trends that are old today.UPDATE: I thank my colleague J. HIGGINS for the following elucidation of the story: ""The prostitute that was called in for the favor at the end was the same one that was in the car at the beginning of the film. Fast was going to cut her with the bottle & Jon intervened. That was the owed favor."" Well done, and I wish I could write as plainly and clearly as HIGGINS. It stuns me how I could have missed that detail.",3,"""It may be unconscious racism, but it is racism.""",1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,5068,"['Now', 'then', 'fun', 'review', 'film', 'just', 'so',
