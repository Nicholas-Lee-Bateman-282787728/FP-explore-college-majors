553678,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B00004W45I,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[2, 2]","""Mother and Son"" by director Aleksandr Sokurov is a visual masterpiece of cinematography reminiscent of Impressionistic paintings by Monet, Renoir, and Cezanne. There are views of a cottage located near magnificent forested mountains, a plain with far vistas which is crossed by a steam engine train, plus a wooded area of birch trees and a path which leads to a lake. Each landscape creates a hypnotic effect on the viewer as the understated drama unfolds before our eyes. The camera and filters create a dream-like atmosphere which captures an often difficult emotional experience to convey on film ... the love between a mother and son. It is during the last stages of life,  when the mother is dying, which makes the film cut even deeper into the heart and soul of the viewer. The camera is used to maximum effect via close ups of facial expressions which clearly captures the true emotions of each character.What is most fascinating is that the director chose people who had never acted to play roles of the mother and son. This perhaps produces a purity of expression far more natural and real, as opposed to an over dramatization by professionals. The son speaks heartfelt words to his mother, asking her how she feels, whether she is hungry or thirsty. Her response is a beautiful and poetic description of being caught in a dream where a dark shadow is encroaching upon her, one from which she can not escape. Her son recites the same words as she does, which makes me think perhaps they are quoting a famous Russian poem which so eloquently encapsulates the feelings of the moment. Her mother's one request is to take a walk. The son seems incredulous and asks her again what is it she wants to do and she clearly says she wants to take a walk. He carries her in his arms to a bench where he sits her down and she lays down. He goes inside to find some reading material and discovers post cards sent long ago. He reads the postcards and sentiments which they express when life was carefree and joyous. She recalls the park and music played by the band and how once she danced to it. They engage in reminiscing about a life long ago. He takes her in his arms, carries her down a pathway to the sea ...The next scenes are within the comfortable and functional cottage where the fireplace is lit. The mother is laying down on a bed which faces a window where she can see the beauty of the garden outside, the mountains and other natural surroundings. Her son strokes her hair while holding her in his arms, realizing the inevitable end is near. I have viewed two other films by Aleksandr Sokurov which I highly recommended:Russian Ark: The Masterworks EditionandAlexandra (Aleksandra) - with ENGLISH subtitles (PAL/R5 - Russian Import). Although each is very original and different from the other, they are definitely stamped with the artistic creativity of this sensitive, masterful and outstanding Russian director.

553679,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00004W45I,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","Aleksandr Sokurov in MAT I SYN (MOTHER AND SON) has succeeded in capturing those brief, breathing moments that surround death, freezing them in an timeless mold like a shell in amber, something that goes beyond the passage of time and captures the essence of extended farewells. This brief film is one of the most probing and tender embraces of the meeting/meaning of life and death, of the continuity of a mother's soul in the form of her son, and most important, it is an elegy about the quiet power and beauty of nature.A son (Aleksei Ananishnov) comforts his terminally ill mother (Gudrun Geyer) with gentle caresses, combing her hair, sharing dreams that are identical, and providing solace in every way imaginable. The mother asks for a walk and the son carries her in his arms to a vantage of the sea and through the gnarled trunks of the woods, a path marked by poplars. He carries her back to the little house, and as she sleeps he walks by himself, observing a little train (a departure) in the distance, a sole ship (a departure) gliding on the ocean, and amidst all this natural beauty he clings to an old tree in a tearful embrace. He returns and his mother has died: the cycle of life is complete.Throughout this seemingly simple film Sokorov concentrates on silence, the little dialogue that is spoken is from the gentle script by Yuri Arabov. The 'actors' are appropriately not actors (Ananishnov is a Professor of Mathematics!). The sounds are of nature - rumbling thunder, wind in the trees - and the minimal music is appropriately by Mikhail Glinka and Otmar Nussio with original music by Mikhail Ivanovich. The cinematography by Aleksei Fyodorov is likely greatly influenced by Sokurov's vision: each frame is a still life of nature both with and without the two characters, and with the use of filters, mirrors and broken glass the images are indescribably beautiful. Filmed on the island of R&uuml;gen close to the coast of Germany the atmosphere is pure and unhindered by peripheral marks of civilization. Sokurov's 1997 film and his subsequent films OTETS I SYN ('FATHER AND SON') and RUSSKIY KOVCHEG ('RUSSIAN ARK') have established him as one of the most creative filmmakers of today. Highly recommended, especially for those who appreciate art, nature, and the humbling magnificence of the cycle of life.

The only boundaries I found being pushed were my boredom.Was there effective cinematography? Yes. Was the countryside beautiful? Yes. Did I learn anything at all about the relationship between the mother and the son? Absolutely not. Obviously he cares for her a great deal. You can see that in the tenderness with which he treats her. That is, admittedly, very touching. But when I watch a film, or read a book, I want to learn something about the characters. All I learned was that he loved his mom. Most of us do, although our relationship may not be as deep - but WHY was their relationship so deep? There was *plenty* of time for dialogue that could have told us something about the two of them. Instead, we see the countryside, we see the son carrying the mother around, brushing her hair back - this does not convey the exactness of their relationship.On a different note, the mother looked dead when the movie started. I don't know how she lasted as long as she did. It was unrealistic. I've had the unfortunate experience of watching someone die, so I know what I'm talking about.Looking at all of the other reviews here, I'm certain that mine will be soundly ""booed"".

553683,A1WTYALNQNQG99,B00004W45I,Larry L. Looney,"[19, 20]","Many films have come along in the history of cinema that have caused reviewers to compare the director's work to that of an artist working on canvas - but Alexander Sokurov's MOTHER AND SON comes closer than anything else I have ever seen to that comparison, barring those who have been blatant in their use of post-production trickery.  One article I read about the film stated that Sokurov was pretty tight-lipped about how he achieved the stunning visual effects in this work - but when pressured, he revealed that NOTHING had been done in the post-production phase of the film, that all of the visuals were accomplished by simple - but painstaking - use of mirrors, panes of glass, special lenses, &amp;c.  The results are breathtaking.  MOTHER AND SON is like nothing I have ever seen.  The effects, rather than distract or detract from the impact of the film, underscore it perfectly - everything occurs as if in a dreamstate, leaving the viewer wondering not only about the 'reality' of the occurrences depicted onscreen, but about their place in time as well.  The film is only 73 minutes long - do the events within take place more or less within that timeframe, or over a more extended one?The portrayal of the soul-deep love between a son and his mother by the two actors is a moving one.  We are left with more questions than answers about their personal situations, their lives apart or together, the locale in which they live - but we are left with no doubts at all about the devotion they feel for each other.I watched this film once on my own, then again a few days later in the company of my best friend.  She drew things from the film that I had missed, and offered some valuable insights.  I would strongly suggest watching it more than once - I feel certain that each viewing will reveal something new, something that will touch and move the viewer on a very deep level.Sokurov was a student (and a close friend) of Andrei Tarkovsky - but his work shows that he is anything but derivative, and a genius in his own right.

There really is no plot; it's all about love, death, and understanding between a mother and son, and how the son deals with her arriving departure.

We (Americans) for the most part don't ever realize this kind of familial love.

This is not surprising, since Sokurov was Tarkovsky's best student at the Russian State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK).  Tarkovsky can be detected as a major source of Sokurov's inspiration, for example, in Sokurov's long takes (sometime longer than Tarkovsky's), his free use of natural sounds, and the unaffectedness of his actors.  Both directors concern themselves with philosophical questions of the human existence and strive to express the inner reality of their beings. However, Sokurov's world is not Tarkovsky's.  Whereas Tarkovsky' main characters are spiritually oppressed, they struggle to overcome and escape their fates, the characters in Sokurov's films are resigned to and accepting of their oppression.  We might say that Tarkovsky's cinema is one of striving toward spiritual liberation, whereas Sukorov's cinema is one of enduring spiritual submission.In Mother and Son, one is struck above all by the rather unusual cinematography, starting with the very first images following the credits.  A young man and a sick old woman are reclining together, their bodies elongated and distorted through the director's use of an anamorphic lens.  They lay motionless for almost a minute, until the son moves his lips, and we realize that we were not looking at a still picture, but at the beginning of a long take, which will last more than five minutes.  The scene has the flatness of a painting instead of the usual three-dimensionality of films.Indeed, Mother and Son is a ""picture-film,"" where the images, the perspectives are routinely distorted and flattened to two dimensions.  Sokurov's intentions are clear so far has he is striving to give his film the appearance of an icon or of a religious painting of the Quattrocento.  Sokurov acknowledges that his filming of Nature has been influenced by the great romantic German painter, Casper David Friedrich.  I would also add that some of the indoor scenes, in particular the opening one, reminds one of the founder of the German expressionist school, Edvard Munch.  The distortion of the characters' physiques and the claustrophobic atmosphere of the room reeking of death also contribute to this identification with Munch's most famous paintings and engravings.All through this production, Sokurov distorts his images in various ways, using panes of glass placed in front or to the side of the lens, mirrors, and even paint on the camera lens itself.  Through these effects, the characters, objects, and nature appear ""compressed"" and distorted, which then serves as a metaphor for the turmoil of the soul.  This turmoil is exacerbated further by the sense of a timelessness which permeates the film.  Time seems suspended by the stillness of the characters.  The long takes (there are fifty-eight shots in a film which runs for seventy-three minutes) also give a sense of stillness, which make us lose all sense of time.  Do the events take place over hours, days, or months?  The whole story could have almost taken place in real time, but we cannot say for certain.Mother and Son is almost a silent film.  The silence which prevails for most of the film is deepened by discrete, natural sounds emanating from beyond the screen, accentuating the sense of isolation from the rest of the world: running water, thunder, wind, bird calls, etc.  In this respect, Nature is an important character, visually as well as aurally.  The appearance of a steaming train or of a sailboat far in the distance only serves to remind us of the isolation of these two characters.  These natural sounds are mixed together with some very subtle original music by Mikhail Ivanovich, together with a few musical segments from Mikhail Glinka and Otmar Nussio.  The dialogue is spare, consisting of occasional short exchanges, often whispered, between mother and son.  These exchanges can hardly be considered conversation.  The characters have gone beyond talking to express their thoughts and inner feelings to each other: as indicated in the beginning of the film, they even have the same dreams.  No philosophical discussions on the meaning of love or death ever arrive to reinforce what is evident through the imagery.Mother and Son's themes are about one of the deepest relationships which can exist on the Earth, the love between a mother and her son, and the solitude of the death experience.  The film explores the remaining moments between the son and his mother on her unavoidable ultimate journey.  Nothing else exists for these two characters, about whom we know nothing.  Sokurov does not reveal anything about their past, nor about their future.  The present moment on their road together toward the doors of death is the only subject of importance.  They are as one being in a strange, lonely, but beautiful world.  But this intimate relationship will soon be rent asunder by Death, and Sokurov shows us that in spite of their close love relationship, in the end death is still a personal, private, isolating experience for both of them.  As the mother drifts in and out of consciousness, the son's attitude as he faces the inescapable end goes from somewhat cheery and reassuring in front of his conscious mother, to total anguish and desperation when he is alone in the woods.If the journey of these characters is a mystical experience, it is not a religious one.  God is never mentioned nor alluded to.  In one scene, where the mother is having an attack, rumbling thunder is heard in the background.  She cries in anguish, ""Who is that up there in the sky?""  Her son answers, ""Nobody.""  So, Sokurov denies a deity, but not some indeterminate afterlife: in the film's ultimate scene, the son whispers softly to his unconscious mother, ""We will meet where we agreed. [...] Be patient, dear Mother, wait for me.""But the film's ending is still ambiguous, as Sokurov leaves open the possibility that the mother is still alive when the son returns from his walk.  In the scene just before the son leaves the house, his mother lies in her bed-coffin, a white butterfly rests on her fingers.  In many cultures, from the Christian Irish to the Baluba from central Zaire, the soul of a person emerges from the cocoon (the grave) and flies away in the form of a butterfly. Sokurov leaves us guessing at the end of the film: on the mother's gray, emaciated hand, the butterfly is alive but it has not yet flown away.Mother and Son is an experience much more than it is a film.  We are confronted with a continuum of painted scenes, as we would in any museum.  We are drawn into each scene as we would be drawn into each painting, reflecting on content which raises in us a myriad of emotions -- some from long ago, forgotten -- or provokes new reflection.  All of these emotions appear and disappear in dream-like fashion and in so doing, we partake in the mystery and complexity of the love between a mother and her son.",4,We will meet where we
