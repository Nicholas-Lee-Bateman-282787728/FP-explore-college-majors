502764,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00000IC1G,mirasreviews,"[5, 5]","""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie"" is John Cassavetes' contribution to the downbeat neo-noir style of the 1970s. Cassavetes wrote and directed this story of a hard-working strip club owner whose ego lands him in hot water with the mob. Cosmo Vitelli (Ben Gazzara) has finally paid off the debt on his club, and he celebrates by donning a tux and taking three of his lovely ladies to a private gambling club for an elegant evening. High on his own success, Cosmo runs up a debt of $23,000. The club's underworld owners say they will erase his debt if Cosmo kills a bookie in Chinatown who has been cutting into their business. ""I may be stupid, but I'm not a fool,"" Cosmo replies.This film has a languorous pace, to put it mildly. A lot of time is spent tooling around Los Angeles with Cosmo and watching the absurd burlesque shows at his club that seem entirely devoid of entertainment value. I did not become comfortable with the pace until an hour into the film, and I think it would have benefited from cutting 20 minutes. Dialogue is spare and almost unnecessary until the film's final minutes. The story is told visually, primarily through Cosmo's actions. That's a good thing, because the dialogue is often mumbled, and the volume is erratic. I don't know if that's a problem with this transfer or if the actors weren't miked properly.In spite of pacing and sound problems, I really like Ben Gazzara's performance. Cosmo is a sleaze, but a lesser sleaze than those around him. He is completely committed to his business to the point of checking up on it while on his way to commit a murder. He's a self-made man with more savvy than his gambling debt would imply, embittered by the mobsters who suddenly control his destiny, but ultimately bemused by his predicament. The villains are an odd lot. There are five of them, seemingly inseparable, who rule by their own little argumentative committee. The film's structure is certainly open to criticism, but ""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie"" is worth seeing for Cosmo.The DVD (Pioneer 1999): There are 2 versions of ""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie"". This is the 108-minute edit released in 1978. The original edit, released in 1976, was 135 minutes. This print looks fine in well-lit scenes, but there is a lot of grain in a few scenes that are dark. Sound is a bigger problem. I had to adjust the volume on my remote for each scene with dialogue, sometimes more than once during the scene.
