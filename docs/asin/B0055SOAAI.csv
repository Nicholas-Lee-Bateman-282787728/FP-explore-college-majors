1443270,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B0055SOAAI,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[2, 2]","My 4 year old is obsessed with this movie!  We have a bunch of other Thomas & Friends DVDs but this one is his favorite.  I have read a few reviews on it and people have said it is scary, but my 3 and 4 year old love it.  I guess it could be a little scary to young kids because the Diesel trains are portrayed as bad guys and there is that scary music in the background, but that's about it.  The DVD is a movie so it is not a bunch of short episodes either which makes it fun to watch.The movie is about Percy feeling left out and joining the Diesel trains at the Dieselworks.  They make him feel special and convince him to help him take over the Sodor Steamworks.  It is a great lesson for kids that they shouldn't hang out with the bad kids just for attention or because they feel left out.  The Diesels were actually using Percy and trying to make Percy turn against his true friends.  Most of the other Thomas movies feature little lessons or troubles, and this movie really has a plot to it!  We were routing for Percy to realize Thomas was really his friend!  The other awesome thing about this movie is the two new firefighting engines - Flynn and Belle are in it and they of course have a fire to put out!  Then there is Kevin the crane in the movie that was neat too.  So if your kids are like mine and like trains, trucks (cranes), and fire engines then this movie will surely be a hit!",5,My 3 and 4 Year old love this movie!,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,1399,"['4', 'year', 'old', 'obsessed', 'movie', 'have', 'bunch', 'other', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'DVDs', 'one', 'favorite', 'have', 'read', 'few', 'reviews', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'scary', '3', '4', 'year', 'old', 'love', 'guess', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'scary', 'young', 'kids', 'Diesel', 'trains', 'are', 'portrayed', 'bad', 'guys', 'scary', 'music', 'background', 'DVD', 'movie', 'not', 'bunch', 'short', 'episodes', 'watch.The', 'movie', 'Percy', 'feeling', 'left', 'out', 'joining', 'Diesel', 'trains', 'Dieselworks', 'make', 'feel', 'special', 'convince', 'help', 'take', 'Sodor', 'Steamworks', 'great', 'lesson', 'kids', 'should', ""n't"", 'hang', 'out', 'bad', 'kids', 'just', 'attention', 'feel', 'left', 'out', 'Diesels', 'were', 'actually', 'using', 'Percy', 'trying', 'make', 'Percy', 'turn', 'true', 'friends', 'Most', 'other', 'Thomas', 'movies', 'feature', 'little', 'lessons', 'troubles', 'movie', 'really', 'plot', 'were', 'routing', 'Percy', 'realize', 'Thomas', 'was', 'really', 'friend', 'other', 'awesome', 'thing', 'movie', 'two', 'new', 'firefighting', 'engines', 'Flynn', 'Belle', 'are', 'course', 'have', 'fire', 'put', 'out', 'Then', 'Kevin', 'crane', 'movie', 'was', 'neat', 'too', 'So', 'kids', 'are', 'mine', 'trains', 'trucks', 'cranes', 'fire', 'engines', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'hit']",Thomas & Friends: Day of the Diesels - The Movie
1443271,AKMRBT9LNA7T7,B0055SOAAI,cnyadan,"[2, 2]","It's to be expected that when a show runs for as long as Thomas, some of the storylines get a bit thin.  However, there is a difference between a thin storyline, which can be compensated for, and something that is so bad that one wonders why the project made it all the way through to getting made (well, besides trying to make tons of money off a successful kids' character franchise).The plot begins with standard children's-story fare - Percy is upset that Thomas is spending lots of times with two new engines on Sodor, and so he's willing to listen to Diesel, who claims that the diesels really want to be Percy's friend.  That's fine, and it's a theme that not only resonates with children, but has successfully been done thousands of times over.This, however, is not one of those times.  By the end of the movie, not only are there a bunch of plot holes and inconsistencies, but there are some fairly terrifying scenes (Thomas locked in a burning shed, for example) and in the end, it seems like the lesson is that if you are a bully, you might get a slap on the wrist, but in the end, you'll get what you want from people.",1,The Worst of the Lot,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,1130,"['be', 'expected', 'when', 'show', 'as', 'long', 'Thomas', 'storylines', 'get', 'bit', 'thin', 'However', 'difference', 'thin', 'storyline', 'can', 'be', 'compensated', 'something', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'project', 'made', 'way', 'getting', 'made', 'well', 'trying', 'make', 'tons', 'money', 'successful', 'kids', 'character', 'franchise', '.The', 'plot', 'standard', ""children's-story"", 'fare', 'Percy', 'upset', 'Thomas', 'spending', 'lots', 'times', 'two', 'new', 'engines', 'Sodor', 'so', 'willing', 'listen', 'Diesel', 'who', 'diesels', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'Percy', 'friend', 'fine', 'theme', 'not', 'only', 'children', 'successfully', 'been', 'done', 'thousands', 'times', 'over.This', 'however', 'not', 'one', 'times', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'bunch', 'plot', 'holes', 'inconsistencies', 'are', 'fairly', 'terrifying', 'scenes', 'Thomas', 'locked', 'burning', 'shed', 'example', 'end', 'lesson', 'are', 'bully', 'might', 'get', 'slap', 'wrist', 'end', ""'ll"", 'get', 'what', 'want', 'people']",Thomas & Friends: Day of the Diesels - The Movie

Lodge,"[35, 48]","I've only bought two of the newer computer generated Thomas DVDs, and while the animation is absolutely fantastic, with realistic train motion and details, this particular story left a lot to be desired.This is NOT for kids 3 and under...it is simply too scary, the characters are too one sided (Percy is particularly annoying with his whining that nobody is paying attention to him) and the climax is a letdown.There are really only 3 characters that get any lines...Diesel 10, Percy, and Thomas.  The start of the DVD is like a long commercial for two new firefighting characters...a water spouting steam engine named Belle, and a fire truck that has both regular tires for the road and railroad wheels for riding on the tracks.  That little story takes a good 20 minutes of the 55 minute running time, and there are no diesels to be seen while Percy whines that Thomas is too busy showing the new engine around the island.  What a sucky baby.My son and I were disappointed that our other favourite engines...Henry, Gordon, James etc. had mere cameo appearances as they raced by on other tracks.  Edward was nowhere to be seen, Toby showed up in the final minutes to help the 'steamies' lead their gang-like rumble against the diesels who had taken over the steamworks.  I've seen better story lines, and more character interaction in the 5 minute shorts of the original series than in this entire 'movie'.  A real shame, as like I said, the animation is absolutely top notch.This is not a story that kids will like.

1443278,A3JJ6LZZ7RFFCU,B0055SOAAI,Jeff B. Sultanof,"[3, 3]","I was concerned when I read some of the negative reviews of this new Thomas video, but my 3 1/2 year old loves Thomas, and he especially loved ""Misty Island"" as a Blu-ray on my large-screen television, so I figured I'd get this. I was far more than pleasantly surprised, I was delighted by this short movie. In fact, I'm sure that writer Sharon Miller knew she was taking a big step with the story.To summarize, Percy feels left out because he doesn't think that Thomas has enough time for him. Diesel (whom Thomas saved in ""Misty Island"") verbally seduces Percy to come to the Dieselworks and meet Diesel-10, who will be his friend. Percy is made to feel welcomed by the diesels, who desperately need a new Dieselworks (their's is old and dirty). The diesels, with Diesel-10 as their ringleader, get Percy to bring Kevin the crane over, and then they get Percy to bring Thomas to the dieselworks, where he is held hostage. Percy is then asked to bring the diesels to the Steamworks, which they take over and destroy. What will happen in the end?The movie makes very important points about knowing who your real friends are, and that some people will make believe they are your friend, but will trick you in the end. Diesel-10's methods are in fact the same as leaders of gangs and other harmful groups; they look for children who don't have friends and want to belong to serve their own agendas. Diesel-10 reminded me of Fagan in ""Oliver Twist."" My son certainly understood this, as he told me the story in his own words just today.

As I've said in previous reviews, I'm generally impressed when I come across a children's DVD that is entertaining for both adults and children alike.DAY OF THE DIESELS fits the bill!Synopsis:  The threat of fires on the island of Sodor has prompted Sir Topham Hatt to have two new firefighting steam engines brought to the island:  Belle and Flynn.  Thomas' best friend Percy feels dejected after Thomas befriends the new engines; Percy no longer feels ""special.""  In turn, Percy decides to accept a dubious invitation from Diesel to visit him and his friends at the Dieselworks - a place that, according to Thomas, should never be visited by the steam engines because, in his own words, ""diesels can be devious.""  Arriving at the Dieselworks, Percy is surprised to discover that the facility is badly run down, dirty, and falling apart; it is the antithesis of the beautiful, clean, and shiny Steamworks facility.  At the  Dieselworks, Percy is greeted by Diesel Ten, the intimidating leader of the diesel engines.  Diesel Ten tricks Percy into believing that he and the diesels are his new best friends; Percy is then duped into assisting Diesel Ten with his devious plan to take over the Steamworks while all of the steam engines are away from the facility.  After the takeover, Percy realizes the error of his ways; he mobilizes the steamies with the intent to take the Steamworks back from the diesels, and a showdown ensues.  However, a last minute intervention on the part of Sir Topham Hatt resolutely resolves the matter, both putting Diesel Ten in his place and acknowledging the need for a new Dieselworks.  In the end, the steamies and the diesels work together to build a new Dieselworks (evoking a rare, benevolent smile from Diesel Ten), and Thomas and Percy resolve their conflict, reaffirming their ""best friends"" status.Interestingly, a sub-set of critical reviews, (that have garnered significant voter approval), state that this movie is too scary for younger children, and that Diesel Ten is too malevolent a character.  Some of the people that wrote these reviewers even criticize the firefighting scenes as being too graphic for their children.Admittedly, with his snapping hydraulic claw, large scowling face, and mischievous vocal intonations, there is no doubt concerning the villainous status of Diesel Ten.  However, it is these same qualities that also make him a memorable and unique character within the Thomas and Friends milieu.For the record, my 5 year old son was NOT scared by this film; he absolutely loved the firefighting scenes, and stated that Diesel Ten is his favorite character in the movie! He also really liked the film's eponymous closing rock song (quite a radical musical change from the British children's chorus of the stop-motion era).  He periodically sang the song's chorus throughout the rest of the weekend.As a final note, I'm also a little bit puzzled by the handful of reviews insinuating that DAY OF THE DIESELS is somehow promoting a ""wrong message"" to children.  I see this film as one that identifies a myriad of all too common human foibles/transgressions, effectively demonstrating to children the inappropriateness of these behaviors, and ultimately promoting the values of teamwork, honesty, and fairness -- We may deplore the general behavior of Diesel Ten, but via this character we are given a vessel in which we can discuss with our children the fact that not everyone does what is right; some people lie and manipulate others for their own means. Moreover, identifying such behaviors is NOT tantamount to promoting them; to the contrary I believe that DAY OF THE DIESELS effectively communicates that Diesel Ten's behavoir and actions are morally and socially wrong, and justice is ultimately served through the admonitions of Sir Topham Hatt.  Likewise, as adults we may find that Percy's emotional vacillations between self pity, jealousy, and anger over Thomas' new found friendships border on hyperbole.  Yet, again, all human beings experience these emotions at various points in their lives; the lesson taught through the exaggerated example of Percy is that overindulgence in such emotions can cloud our judgement, and lead us to potentially make poor or irrational choices.While it may not be a particularly enjoyable task to discuss such things as conflict, lying, bullying, negative emotions, etc. with our children, the fact remains that these are ubiquitous realities that all children will eventually face; DAY OF THE DIESELS provides a platform for adults to discuss these issues with young children.DAY OF THE DIESELS was a fun movie; my son very much enjoyed it, and I intend to purchase a copy of the DVD.  That being said, I also understand that every child is different; what frightens one child may have an opposite effect on another.  If your child has a tendency toward being very easily frightened, you may want to consider getting a copy of this film from your local library and sitting down with your child for an initial viewing.",5,Diesel Ten is a great villain!,1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,5102,"['5', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'watch', 'many', 'children', 'shows', 'movies', 'together', ""'ve"", 'said', 'previous',

He saw that movie a year ago and there still isn't a week that goes by that he doesn't re-enact something from the Diesel & jobi wood sequence (in fact, tonight Emily was hooked up to Rocky and Rocky was dropping her over the side of my couch ""into the sea below."").I was very excited there was a new Thomas movie, and the re-appearance of Diesel 10 (who you see at the very end of Misty Island as a set up for this movie). Well, I can say my son has seen it about 20 times by now and really likes it. He has the Cranky and Flynn TrackMaster set and re-enacts the fire sequence and makes up his own play, which tells me it captured his imagination.The movie is beautiful to look at. It starts with a fire, and Flynn (fire engine that can go on tracks) and Belle (new engine who fights fires) help put it out. Flynn is touted as a hero. Thomas is told by Sir Topham Hatt to take care of them, leaving Percy feeling abandoned. Diesel ""oils up"" to Percy and starts sowing the seeds of discord, and Diesel 10 is Percy's new best friend who just wants something from him. In a brave move, Percy goes to the Diesel Works, and then when he finds out how run down it is and how the diesels lack even a crane, talks Kevin into going with him from the Steam Works.Diesel 10 schemes and manipulates and finally the time comes when everyone is away from the Steam Works. The diesels and Percy charge over to the Steam Works and take it over. I don't think any parents will mind if I spoil the ending here, but Percy, Thomas, and Sir Topham Hatt end up confronting the diesels. Sir Topham Hatt is cross (isn't he always? =), but Thomas and Percy cut in to explain the poor conditions of the Diesel Works. A little later, everyone (steamies and diesels) work together to build a new Diesel Works.My son had big saucer eyes during the fire, and was a bit tense at times when Diesel 10 was being particularly devious. He wasn't scared, but definitely anxious at certain points. The measure of the film, however, is that he has continued to ask for it again and again. I didn't like this one nearly as much as other Thomas movies, and less than the TV series. So 5 stars from my Thomas fanatic, 3 stars from me. Maybe it's because Percy is so annoying!",4,"3 year old gives 5 stars, mom 3",1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,2446,"['3', '1/2', 'year', 'old', 'liked', 'Great', 'Discovery', 'Hero', 'Rails', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'pleased', 'Misty', 'Island', 'too', 'many', 'unbelievable/out', 'there/', 'ugh', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'LOVING', 'saw', 'movie', 'year', 'ago', 'there', 'still', ""n't"", 'week', ""n't"", 're-enact', 'something', 'Diesel', 'jobi', 'wood', 'sequence', 'fact', 'tonight', 'Emily', 'was', 'hooked', 'up', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'was', 'dropping', 'side', 'couch', 'sea', '.I', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'was', 'new', 'Thomas', 'movie', 're-appearance', 'Diesel', '10', 'who', 'see', 'very', 'end', 'Misty', 'Island', 'set', 'up', 'movie', 'Well', 'can', 'say', 'son', 'seen', '20', 'times', 'now', 'really', 'Cranky', 'Flynn', 'TrackMaster', 'set', 're-enacts', 'fire', 'sequence', 'up', 'own', 'play', 'captured', 'imagination.The', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'look', 'fire', 'Flynn', 'fire', 'engine', 'can', 'go', 'tracks', 'Belle', 'new', 'engine', 'who', 'fires', 'help', 'put', 'out', 'Flynn', 'touted', 'hero', 'Thomas', 'told', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'take', 'care', 'leaving', 'Percy', 'feeling', 'abandoned', 'Diesel', 'up', 'Percy', 'sowing', 'seeds', 'discord', 'Diesel', '10', 'Percy', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'just', 'something', 'brave', 'move', 'Percy', 'Diesel', 'Works', 'then', 'when', 'out', 'how', 'run', 'down', 'how', 'diesels', 'lack', 'even', 'crane', 'talks', 'Kevin', 'going', 'Steam', 'Works.Diesel', '10', 'schemes', 'manipulates', 'finally', 'time', 'when', 'everyone', 'away', 'Steam', 'Works', 'diesels', 'Percy', 'charge', 'Steam', 'Works', 'take', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'parents', 'will', 'mind', 'spoil', 'ending', 'here', 'Percy', 'Thomas', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'end', 'up', 'confronting', 'diesels', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'cross', ""n't"", 'always', '=', 'Thomas', 'Percy', 'cut', 'explain', 'poor', 'conditions', 'Diesel', 'Works', 'little', 'later', 'everyone', 'steamies', 'diesels', 'work', 'together', 'build', 'new', 'Diesel', 'Works.My', 'son', 'had', 'big', 'saucer', 'eyes', 'fire', 'was', 'bit', 'tense', 'times', 'when', 'Diesel', '10', 'was', 'being', 'particularly', 'devious', 'was', ""n't"", 'scared', 'definitely', 'anxious', 'certain', 'points', 'measure', 'film', 'however', 'continued', 'ask', 'again', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'Thomas', 'movies', 'less', 'TV', 'series', 'So', '5', 'stars', 'Thomas', 'fanatic', '3', 'stars', 'Maybe', 'Percy', 'so', 'annoying']",Thomas & Friends: Day of the Diesels - The Movie
