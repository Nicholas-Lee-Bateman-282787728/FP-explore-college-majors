190802,A21T2ZAT0QA0KO,1573628131,ChildInside,"[1, 2]","Alright, this time, the Leprechaun is in the hood.It starts off with the Leprechaun introducing the new item of magic (his flute) and then Mack (Ice T) appears. It turns out someone sold his associate a ""crappy map"", but it turns out the map was correct when Mack threw his associate through a wooden wall. He found the magic flute he desired and his associate found gold. Things go wrong when the guy takes the medallion that kept the Leprechaun frozen, though. However, Mack gets lucky.A few years later, Mack is a rich ghetto tycoon thanks to that flute that entrances whoever hears it, and three young men are vying to get into the rap business with their brand of PSA rap. There is Post, the moralistic one, there is Butch, the intelligent one, and there is Stray, the ambitious one. In their hopes to become stars, they end up at Mack's feet, but he blows them off when they are hesitant to change to gangsta rap. Angry, they end up robbing Mack, and this starts off a chain of events that will eventually unlease the Leprechaun.This movie is not as good as the original (are there any Leprechauns that are?), but it kept me entertained, so that's enough. It has the usual plot holes, such as why did Mack left his flute hanging around at his house when he usually carried it everywhere with him?One thing I thought it did great was show the main characters' true colors later on. In the beginning, Post was moralistic, but his greed soon overcame him later on.

How can you go wrong with The Leprechaun going to the hood and trading one-liners with Ice-T? Well, this movie is so packed with awful ideas and poor sterotypes that you wonder who would ever allow it to go into production? Clearly, whoever wrote it is not a fan of hip-hop nor has ever actually been to any type of urban area because they come up with ideas that members of either community would find insulting.Ice-T is a rap mogul/gangsta with the highly original name ""Mack Daddy"" who steals the Leprechaun's flute and uses it to succeed in the rap world. Don't ask me how! A trio of lame rappers named Butch, Postmaster P, and Stray Bullet steal the flute and end up unleashing the Leprechaun. They spend most of the movie hiding out in either the church or with some goofy ""drag queen"". For some reason, the writers find quite a bit of humor in grown men dressing like woman as for reasons that make no sense, the bumbling rappers dress up like broads and go back to find Mack Daddy. If you manage to sit through this hour and a half of trash, you get rewarded with a Leprechaun rap. Doesn't that make it all worth it?If you're a big fan of cross-dressing or some rather racist humor (Leprechaun even pokes fun at Martin Luther King), this one will blow your hair back.

From the first with Jen all the way to the second Hood flick after this one, I enjoy them all. This one in particular is really fun because not only is The Lep in the Hood but Ice T is also here and joining in on the fun. I ask you this question, what could be better than that?Three young rappers who are trying to make it big and get out of their neighborhood can't really make out why they are falling behind on their dream. It may be because they are trying for a positive message, well that is if you believe everyone else around them. That is until they break into Mac Daddy's office [Ice T] and find a flute and accidentally release the Leprechaun. He had been turned to stone by Mac Daddy years earlier when he took flute. The flute helps the boys as it makes everyone listen and love their music, but it draws the Lep towards them more and more. So now they are on the run from both the Leprechaun and Mc Daddy as well. Just another day in the hood.I can't help it I am a sucker for these types of B movies; there is just something about them that make me think of a happier time. This series in particular was just always fun because of Warwick and his performance. Of course none of them were every really scary but the dark humor in these and the crazy kills always entertain. This one in particular is really funny because now not only is the Lep rhyming but he is also rapping. Of course I also like that Bad Azz from the DPG makes a cameo appetence here in this film as does Coolio.Directed by Rob Spera who also made the first ""Witchcraft"" and ""Bloody Murder 2"" keeps things moving nicely and the film never feels long or anything. And the guys playing the wanna be rappers do an excellent job in this movie and are well cast. Ice T of course is the man as he always is, and Warwick holds it down as the Leprechaun.

190808,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,1573628131,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 5]","Until we learned that another &quot;Leprechaun&quot; film would explode onto the public's consciousness at the end of 2003, &quot;Leprechaun in the Hood&quot; a.k.a &quot;Leprechaun 5&quot; appeared to be the final installment in a series that had long worn out its welcome. The first three movies weren't all that bad in terms of entertainment value, with Warwick Davis developing his shtick against the backdrop of bad acting from unknown thespians, increasingly cheesy situations, lamer jokes and sight gags, and gorier killings. The amusement value of the &quot;Leprechaun&quot; franchise came to a screeching halt with the release of the fourth film, where the miniscule fairy turned up in a film set in space with disastrous results. Apparently scared by how bad a product they had turned out, the friendly folks at Trimark waited almost four years before returning to the land of the leprechauns. The result? Y2K's &quot;Leprechaun in the Hood,&quot; an idea so outrageous, so full of pitfalls from the start that even trash cinema lovers stopped breathing for a heartbeat. Now we await the return of Davis in &quot;Leprechaun: Back 2 Da Hood&quot; and wonder where it all went wrong. Whatever it means, we are light years away from a fresh-faced Jennifer Aniston running from the malevolent monster back in the halcyon days of 1993. The phrase &quot;You can never go home again&quot; never resonated so strongly.However pedestrian this film is, it is important to state that &quot;Leprechaun 5&quot; is vastly superior to its immediate predecessor. After watching the diminutive demon cackle his way through space, I didn't know what to expect from this film. I knew I would get some killings and see Davis deliver ham handed lines in a thick Irish brogue, but I swore I would toss my DVD player through the window before I endured a repeat of the fourth movie. Don't get me wrong: this movie still ranks as mediocrity incarnate, but it is at least watchable. Perhaps the appearance of Ice-T and the three actors who played the young rappers looking for a big break helped move this picture along. Even the guys who played the money grubbing minister and the cross dresser who has an unfortunate encounter with the leprechaun provided a few chuckles along the way. Overall, the performances here are head and shoulders above several entries in the series (look back to Bridget's wooden delivery in &quot;Leprechaun 2&quot; as a comparison).The plot, such as it is, now finds the tiny terror once again turned to stone and vulnerable to thieving humans in search of gold. Enter Ice-T as Mack Daddy, a street thug with an Afro the size of a mountain who has heard that this statue hides some valuables. He especially wants to get his hands on a tiny golden flute that has the unique power to instantly spellbind anyone who hears it. In the course of securing the magical instrument, the leprechaun wakes up when Mack Daddy's accomplice takes a necklace off of the statue (shades of &quot;Leprechaun 3&quot;). After a pitched battle that sees the pimp taking weapons out of his afro (sigh), the little imp is re-imprisoned and we flash ahead about ten or twenty years to the present day. Mack is now a big shot record producer, always on the lookout to sign hot new gangsta rappers on his label. Around his wrist he wears that magic flute he stole so many years ago, and most people have no idea where his money or his talent come from. Postmaster P, Stray Bullet, and Butch, three kids who formed a group to sing songs with a positive message, certainly don't know about Mack's magical success story. When Mack Daddy gives the three a chance at stardom, Postmaster P turns him down because he doesn't want anything to do with the negativity of gangsta rap. Mack kicks the kids out, but the three come back at night to rob his house in order to get some money so they can afford to compete in a talent competition.Regrettably, during the course of the robbery Mack Daddy takes a bullet and the leprechaun, sitting in a glass cage in the middle of Mack's office, is once again freed to maim and kill. It turns out that Mack Daddy didn't die, but the kids stole his flute and he wants it back. So does the leprechaun, who promptly kills anyone the three rappers encounter after the robbery. The rest of the movie is a series of ridiculous situations involving these characters as they try to stay one step ahead of the others. Throw in a cross dresser, a naughty rap song about Jesus at the local church, a funny black grandmother, fly girls from hell (sigh again), an ending so incredibly stupid that I slipped into a coma after I watched it, and you have all the elements of an incredibly cheesy production that plays more like a slapstick comedy than a horror film. &quot;Leprechaun in the Hood&quot; is definitely for diehard fans of the series only. Again, at least it is better than part four.The DVD for this movie is the same as any other Trimark &quot;Leprechaun&quot; disc: some trailers and a good picture transfer. Again, there is no commentary for the movie from Warwick Davis. You have to admit that after watching a few of these movies, you would love to hear what the lead actor has to say about his character. As bad as some of these movies have been, I really don't blame Warwick Davis for reprising his role as the leprechaun. Parts for the permanently diminutive are scarce in Hollywood, to say the least, so beating this dead horse for yet another paycheck is something I would do in similar circumstances.

Some of the movies are good, some are not so good. First of all, your common sense has to go out for a smoke while watching these films. I enjoyed 'In Space' and 'Back to the Hood'. But this one 'In the Hood' just isn't as good.Sure it has it's moments. The film starts out promising enough with Ice T dressed like Rolo from Sanford and Son and sporting a Hendrix afro, but not even Mack Daddy can save this film.The stereotyping is deliberate and hysterical. Who can't laugh when Lep says ""Steal me gold youlittle hoods, ye got more balls than Tiger Woods!"" Other moments of true comedy are when the blind grandmother is feeding Lep and accidently pulls his eye out with a fork, and the 'Church Rap'. The lyrics are dismal to say the least. ""Jesus loves me this I know, if He don't I'll find a hoe."" Brilliant.Leprechaun has a lot of powers in this movie., He can make your gun heat up so that you drop it, he can make your insides explode, he can make you turn your own gun on yourself, and he does a little 'Invasion if the Body Snatchers' too. He gets his small band of ""Fly Lep cootchie girls' to do his bidding.The plot (yes there is one) is as asinine as they come. Not only does Lep have a pot o' gold, he has a magic flute. No matter how bad your music is, just blow the flute and everyone will think it's the greatest music they've ever heard. It's every rapper's and garage band's dream come true. Three young rappers with a positive message go hard core and use the flute to go to the top. However, only one survives. He does this by dressing up like a woman. Uh, you'll have to see this part yourself.As much as I love lep though, there's one thing that he must never, ever do again.

It's not in the least bit scary, but then again none of the Lep movies really are. You don't watch them to be scared, you watch them because deep down, you know you love to see people running and screaming from him. It's just fun to watch. Over the life span of the Leprachaun movies. We've seen him in the back woods, outerspace, now the hood! It might not be a logical step, but it makes for an oddly entertaining movie. I think the movie can be summed up by the beginning. Where the Lep is freed from frozen state and quotes &quot;free at last, free at last, thank God almighty I'm free at last&quot; with a laugh. There is a lot wrong with him quoting Martin Luther King, but it's funny! And there's quite a bit of humor people will find offensive, there are stereotypes played up, but remember it's all in fun. For a good part of this movie the lep isn't even in it. I think the 3 homies add much to it, and Ice Tee is a riot. But the Lep as always, takes the cake. We have him rapping, we have him smoking marajuana, and even a mack, with all his ladies. This is a flick you cannot take serious, and while it's humorus, it's more of an underlined offbeat humor. You'll either get it, or you'll think this is a waste of a movie. I personally love it.

190814,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,1573628131,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[4, 4]","OK, it wasn't that bad, I just really wanted to get to use that line for once (my friend who went to see Lep 1 in the theater yelled it out during the movie and got a huge ovation).My same friend also made a good point about watching the Lep series in general: you know exactly what you're getting up front. It's not like after the movie you're going to say to yourself, surprised, &quot;well, THAT was a total piece of (bad word rhyming with &quot;hit&quot;)&quot;. You can't really be mad at yourself. It's not like going to see, say, Whipped or 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag where you think you might actually laugh once or twice at something or enjoy the movie at some points, but end up wanting to punch everyone involved in the face (even Joe Pesci). No-one tricked you into it.Anyway, this one was better than part 4 (In Space), but of course that's not saying much. The best one of the series (I can't believe I'm saying that-I should say &quot;the least painful to sit through&quot; instead) was the one set in Vegas. This one I rented mainly because I heard it was mildly amusing, better than part 4, but mainly I wanted to see Ice-T in a 70's pimp outfit sporting a big 'fro. I think the whole budget went towards paying his salary and they didn't have much left over for costumes, special effects, sets, etc. Oh well, it still beat 'Play it to the Bone'.This one had at least some entertainment value because it didn't take itself too seriously. A couple of things happened I didn't expect. Of course, couple things also happened that I didn't WANT to happen but had a horrible premonition that they were going to, such as the Leprechaun smoking a blunt and rapping (though not at the same time, Thank God). They were a few times I was surprised to burst out laughing at stuff that I think was supposed to intentionally be funny. There was one particularly funny moment when the heroes are hiding from the Leprechaun that was worth the money I paid to rent it, because it was exactly like a scene from Scooby-Doo (in fact, I think it WAS a scene they stole from Scooby-Doo, but at least they stole from something amusing). I thought at first it was just because I had the flu at the time I watched it and had lots of Nyquil, but then my husband laughed at it too. There's another scene where two characters are having a very serious discussion about how to go after the Lep -- this is after a tragic event occurs, so I figured the movie was going to stop trying to be funny-- and you see that one of them is holding &quot;Leprechauns For Dummies&quot;. For some reason (maybe this time it was the Nyquil) that also struck me as pretty amusing.I bet some overly politically correct people would be really offended by this movie. For instance, you could easily have a Leprechaun 5: In the Hood Drinking Game with your friends (hey, you could use Nyquil! It's even green) during the movie just by drinking every time a character says, &quot;a'ight&quot;, &quot;yo&quot;, &quot;homie&quot;, or &quot;that (same bad word as before) is WHACKED, man!&quot;. So, while on the negative side, we have the fact that the movie is completely stupid and mindless, with little gore, and really cheap production values, we do have the positives of a few good laughs and the fact that it would anger the overly PC. I've seen a lot of horror movies WAY worse and more insulting to viewer's intelligence, so I didn't really want my money back after I rented it.",3,I Wants Me Money Back!,982800000,"02 22, 2001",2001,3448,"['OK', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'really', 'wanted', 'get', 'use', 'line', 'once', 'friend', 'who', 'went', 'see', 'Lep', '1', 'theater', 'yelled', 'out', 'movie', 'got', 'huge', 'ovation', '.My', 'same', 'friend', 'also', 'made', 'good', 'point', 'watching', 'Lep', 'series', 'general', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'up', 'front', 'not', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'say', 'surprised', 'quot', 'well', 'THAT', 'was', 'total', 'piece', 'bad', 'word', 'rhyming', 'quot', 'hit', 'quot', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'mad', 'not', 'like', 'going', 'see', 'say', 'Whipped', '8', 'Heads', 'Duffel', 'Bag', 'where', 'think', 'might', 'actually', 'laugh', 'once', 'twice', 'something', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'points', 'end', 'up', 'wanting', 'punch', 'everyone', 'involved', 'face', 'even', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'No-one', 'tricked', 'it.Anyway', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'part', '4', 'Space', 'course', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'best', 'one', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'that-I', 'should', 'say', 'quot', 'least', 'painful', 'sit', 'quot', 'instead', 'was', 'one', 'set', 'Vegas', 'one', 'rented', 'mainly', 'heard', 'was', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'better', 'part', '4', 'mainly', 'wanted', 'see', 'Ice-T', '70', 'pimp', 'outfit', 'sporting', 'big', ""'fro"", 'think', 'whole', 'budget', 'went', 'towards', 'paying', 'salary', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'left', 'over', 'costumes', 'special', 'effects', 'sets', 'etc', 'Oh', 'well', 'still', 'beat', ""'Play"", ""Bone'.This"", 'one', 'had', 'least', 'entertainment', 'value', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'couple', 'things', 'happened', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'course', 'couple', 'things', 'also', 'happened', 'did', ""n't"", 'WANT', 'happen', 'had', 'horrible', 'premonition', 'were', 'going', 'such', 'Leprechaun', 'smoking', 'blunt', 'rapping', 'not', 'same', 'time', 'Thank', 'God', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'surprised', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'stuff', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'intentionally', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'one', 'particularly', 'funny', 'moment', 'when', 'heroes', 'are', 'hiding', 'Leprechaun', 'was', 'money', 'paid', 'rent', 'was', 'exactly', 'scene', 'Scooby-Doo', 'fact', 'think', 'scene', 'stole', 'Scooby-Doo', 'least', 'stole', 'something', 'amusing', 'thought', 'first', 'was', 'just', 'had', 'flu', 'time', 'watched', 'had', 'lots', 'Nyquil', 'then', 'husband', 'laughed', 'too', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'having', 'very', 'serious', 'discussion', 'how', 'go', 'Lep', 'tragic', 'event', 'occurs', 'figured', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'stop', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'see', 'one', 'holding', 'quot', 'Leprechauns', 'Dummies', 'quot', 'reason', 'maybe', 'time', 'was', 'Nyquil', 'also', 'struck', 'pretty', 'amusing.I', 'bet', 'overly', 'politically', 'correct', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'offended', 'movie', 'instance', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'Leprechaun', '5', 'Hood', 'Drinking', 'Game', 'friends', 'hey', 'could', 'use', 'Nyquil', 'even', 'green', 'movie', 'just', 'drinking', 'time', 'character', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'same', 'bad', 'word', 'WHACKED', 'man', 'quot', 'So', 'negative', 'side', 'have', 'fact', 'movie', 'completely', 'stupid', 'mindless', 'little', 'gore', 'really', 'cheap', 'production', 'values', 'do', 'have', 'positives', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'fact', 'would', 'anger', 'overly', 'PC', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'WAY', 'worse', 'more', 'insulting', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'money', 'back', 'rented']",N/A

190822,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,1573628131,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","The fifth in the increasingly ridiculous ""Leprechaun"" series, ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" goes where no other movie ever dreamed to go before. That originality garnered the movie a bonus star in my rating, but make no mistake, this is a tough slog no matter how big a fan of Leprechauns, Irish superstitions, rap, Ice-T, or Coolio (!) you may be. The film opens with a terrible poem (""No one is safe from a Lep in the hood!"") and immediately flashes back to the 1970s with Ice-T (as ""Mack Daddy"") and another hood in stupendously hilarious afros (not to mention the clothes and shoes) getting in a fight with Warwick Davis who is reprising his diminutive role as a brogue-spewing menace, this time with the bonus of rap being thrown in the mix. I very much enjoyed the opening fight scene, particularly the novel use of an afro pick. The scene sets up the rest of the film as Mack Daddy gains the Leprechaun's magic flute that can mesmerize people, as well as the Leprechaun himself who is perfectly inert as long as his necklace is on.Fast forward to 2000 and Mack Daddy is now an urban kingpin and rap mogul. He is stereotypically nasty, which is why it's odd that three aspiring rappers headed by ""Postmaster P"" (A.T. Montgomery; the ""P"" is for ""positive"" as they only do life-affirming rap...ponder) pursue him to get a record deal. You see they need money to buy musical gear to go to a contest in Las Vegas. (Now there's a business plan!) The positive intents don't get them far, as they steal Mack Daddy's flute and unlock the Leprechaun, which results in a flurry of ridiculous subplots and dialogue (Davis even fires off a Tiger Woods joke!) Please enjoy Ice-T and the Leprechaun getting wasted in a public bathroom, a wholly unexpected tribute to ""Goldfinger,"" a particularly horrifying dancing restaurateur, a long and pointless cross-dressing component, a blind grandma, a genuinely offensive depiction of a sanctuary church (totally unsatisfactory in every conceivable way,) and a rapper who is also conveniently a chemical engineer (right...) all leading up to that comic payoff: Leprechaun in the fridge (which could perhaps be another in the series now that I think of it...it wouldn't be more boring.)I didn't find a sympathetic character in the lot, and the faster the Irish terror could dispatch everyone the better as far as I was concerned. I did enjoy the plan deduced from reading ""Leprechauns for Dummies"" (hint: it involves smoking four leaf clovers,) though I did not enjoy the terrible conclusion involving Postmaster P and the Leprechaun in a brogue-riddled rhyming contest, which segues into some of the most painful closing credits in memory.The trailer is the only significant extra, and I would advise simply watching that and throwing the DVD away. You'll get the idea and it will be a lot less painful. There are a few entertaining concepts in the film and the plot is audacious to say the least. I don't recommend ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" as the entertaining scenes are few and far between and the interstitial space is a long and harrowing road.",2,The Movie Proving That Hand Feeding A Leprechaun Is Harder Than It Looks...For A Blind Woman,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,3078,"['fifth', 'increasingly', 'ridiculous', 'Leprechaun', 'series', 'Leprechaun', 'Hood', 'where', 'other', 'movie', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'go', 'before', 'originality', 'garnered', 'movie', 'bonus', 'star', 'rating', 'make', 'mistake', 'tough', 'slog', 'matter', 'how', 'big', 'fan', 'Leprechauns', 'Irish', 'superstitions', 'rap', 'Ice-T', 'Coolio', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'terrible', 'poem', 'one', 'safe', 'Lep', 'hood', 'immediately', 'flashes', 'back', '1970s', 'Ice-T', 'Mack', 'Daddy', 'hood', 'stupendously', 'hilarious', 'afros', 'not', 'mention', 'clothes', 'shoes', 'getting', 'fight', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'who', 'reprising', 'diminutive', 'role', 'brogue-spewing', 'menace', 'time', 'bonus', 'rap', 'being', 'thrown', 'mix', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'opening', 'fight', 'scene', 'particularly', 'novel', 'use', 'afro', 'pick', 'scene', 'up', 'rest', 'film', 'Mack', 'Daddy', 'gains', 'Leprechaun', 'magic', 'flute', 'can', 'mesmerize', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'Leprechaun', 'who', 'perfectly', 'inert', 'as', 'long', 'necklace', 'on.Fast', 'forward', '2000', 'Mack', 'Daddy', 'now', 'urban', 'kingpin', 'rap', 'mogul', 'stereotypically', 'nasty', 'why', 'odd', 'three', 'aspiring', 'rappers', 'headed', 'Postmaster', 'P', 'A.T.', 'Montgomery', 'P', 'positive', 'only', 'do', 'life-affirming', 'rap', 'ponder', 'pursue', 'get', 'record', 'deal', 'see', 'need', 'money', 'buy', 'musical', 'gear', 'go', 'contest', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Now', 'business', 'plan', 'positive', 'intents', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'far', 'steal', 'Mack', 'Daddy', 'flute', 'unlock', 'Leprechaun', 'results', 'flurry', 'ridiculous', 'subplots', 'dialogue', 'Davis', 'even', 'off', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'joke', 'Please', 'enjoy', 'Ice-T', 'Leprechaun', 'getting', 'wasted', 'public', 'bathroom', 'wholly', 'unexpected', 'tribute', 'Goldfinger', 'particularly', 'horrifying', 'dancing', 'restaurateur', 'long', 'pointless', 'cross-dressing', 'component', 'blind', 'grandma', 'genuinely', 'offensive', 'depiction', 'sanctuary', 'church', 'totally', 'unsatisfactory', 'conceivable', 'way', 'rapper', 'who', 'also', 'conveniently', 'chemical', 'engineer', 'right', 'leading', 'up', 'comic', 'payoff', 'Leprechaun', 'fridge', 'could', 'perhaps', 'be', 'series', 'now', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'lot', 'faster', 'Irish', 'terror', 'could', 'dispatch', 'everyone', 'better', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'did', 'enjoy', 'plan', 'deduced', 'reading', 'Leprechauns', 'Dummies', 'hint', 'smoking', 'four', 'leaf', 'clovers', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'terrible', 'conclusion', 'involving', 'Postmaster', 'P', 'Leprechaun', 'brogue-riddled', 'rhyming', 'contest', 'most', 'painful', 'closing', 'credits', 'memory.The', 'trailer', 'only', 'significant', 'extra', 'would', 'advise', 'simply', 'watching', 'throwing', 'DVD', 'away', ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'less', 'painful', 'are', 'few', 'entertaining', 'concepts', 'film', 'plot', 'audacious', 'say', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Leprechaun', 'Hood', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'interstitial', 'space', 'long', 'harrowing', 'road']",N/A

190826,A3UA046AA3DXFD,1573628131,Sid the Elf,"[5, 5]","Meaningless National Holidays are the best, aren't they? We, Sid the Elf, certainly think so. They give us the chance to, among other things, watch a ton of B and consume a copious ammount of food. If there is a better combination, other than the trifecta, Sid has yet to find it. So, we decided to honor Christopher Columbus in the best way possible by double-dipping B and getting some unbelievable Italian take-out to honor the famous Italian explorer. The first selection was Leprechaun in the Hood. We can admit that we got suckered in by even the slightest possibility of seeing the leprechaaun(Sid's Irish cousin) chase Ice-T around with a pink turkey baster. Well, that didn't happen. So we were disappointed by that and by the film overall.This film started with a scene set in the 70's. Ice-T's character Mack Daddy(lots of thought went into that one) and an equally fro'ed buddy went on a treasure hunt in the cave of the Irish elf. They take the necklace from around the leprechaun's neck which awakens him from his state of stone. The leprechaun procedes to stab Ice-T's buddy in the throat with a 'fro pick and he attempts to kill Ice-T, but honestly, who hasn't? Anyway, Ice manages to get the necklace back onto Irish Sid's neck and turn him back to stone after stealing the leprechaun's magical flute that mesmerizes anyone who hears it. Then we flash-forward to the present(2000) where Mack Daddy is a big-shot record producer, presumably due largely to his magical flute. One of the groups eager to catch Mack Daddy's eye and play his flute were three complete wackbags from Compton. Now, this flick took the early 90's Compton thing and tried to make it play in 2000. This probably wouldn't have worked even if the group in question here wasn't trying to convey a positive message using a ""gangsta rap"" style. Not surprisingly, Mack Daddy didn't sign the three cool cats. So, they decide to rob/trash Mack Daddy's house. In the course of the robbery, Mack Daddy takes a bullet and the leprechaun, who is in stone form sitting in a glass case in Mack Daddy's office is freed. Also, the rappers take Mack Daddy's flute. So these three now have Ice-T and the leprechaun chasing after them in order to get the flute back. The guys then decide to hide out with a drag queen, take a few pointers then cross-dress, themselves as Sid is quite sure they had previously done many times. They end up using the flute to proceed in the rap world and...ok we'll be honest, we started fast-forwarding at this point because even we couldn't take it anymore. We only stopped at two points in the rest of the movie. One was when we spotted Coolio(yep, he was available) and decided to throw some easy jokes his way. The other was undoubedly the highlight of this movie and probably all of the Leprechaun movies. The Leprechaun burned a unit. Really, just a holistic, watershed moment in Sid's B-watching life.What we really don't understand is how this film went wrong. There was an elf as the main character withSurviving the Gamealum Ice-T as a major focal point. Coolio even made an apperance which led to a ton of good cracks. Running the risk of sounding inarticulate, this movie was just plain stupid. The rappers were unbelievably unlikable and they reeked of ""If this isn't my big break, I have 50 years of Mickey D'd ahead of me"" desperation. The plot was ridiculous with the inexplicable cross-dressing/drag queens. And there wasn't enough leprechaun. Irish Sid was only in about a half of the film. We needed to see a lot more of that little mainiac running around offing people with a potato or a magic bottle of Jameson's or something.
