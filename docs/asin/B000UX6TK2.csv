1097290,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B000UX6TK2,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[0, 0]","The 21st century has given much to the LGBT community.  Equal marriage rights progress slowly yet steadily.  Never before has there been such acceptance of gay men and women. Artistically, we`ve made our stamp on cultural history.  Over a few short years, there has been the L Word, Brokeback Mountain and yes, most revolutionary of them all:  Queer as Folk.OAF did two things that catapulted the series into lasting permanence.  It was the first TV series to embrace gay male sexuality.  An episode wasn`t a OAF episode if it failed to contain the prerequisite highly stylized sex scene.  OAF confronted straight America`s queasiness about gay sex head on.  As a result, gay sexuality in film and TV today is much more prevalent thanks to OAF`s trailblazing efforts.Even more revolutionary was OAF`s insistence on showing the everyday struggles of gay men and women, struggles no different from those faced by straight people. The series touched so many for two reasons.  First, the depth and richness of the characters created a compelling drama.  Second, the acting talent on the show was top-rate.  Unfortunately, even now the immensely talented actors/actresses who started on the series, Peter Paige, Hal Sparks, Scott Lowell, Gale Harold, Thea Gill, Michelle Clunie, have yet to be recognized for their acting merits.OAF`s characters spanned the horizon of gaydom.  It had the iconic alpha-gay, Brian Kenney, the irrepressible nelly queen, Emmett Honeycutt, the addiction-plagued accountant/opera lover, Ted Schmidt, the boyish comic-book expert and secret love of Brian, Michael Novotny, and even the HIV + academic, Ben.  And who could forget, the shining Sharon Gless as Debbie Novotny, the foul-mouthed and feisty defender of queers everywhere.  And to its credit, the show gave space to gay women as well.  Melanie and Lindsay`s tortured, yet ultimately salvaged relationship lent the series an added gravity.  In short, OAF`s diverse characters proved just how open-ended `gay identity` is.The show explored conflicts universal in nature.  There was Brian`s chronic promiscuity and reluctance to commit to his nubile teen lover, Justin.  Their tumultuous relationship spanned all bases from lustful infatuation to final, albeit reluctant, commitment.  To the show`s credit, Brian and Justin`s relationship portrayed the reality that many gay couples face.  On the other hand, Ben and Michael`s relationship showed that committed gay couples face the same challenges any straight couple would with marital strife, child adoption problems etc...The stories of Emmett and Ted also embraced a variety of universal situations.  Emmett overcame self-loathing to become the show`s proudest and fiercest queer.  Ted was the show`s `everyday queer,` one who struggled with problems of addiction and low self-esteem.In conclusion, OAF tapped into a myriad of relevant issues.  Parental acceptance, school bullies and intergenerational relationships were but a few.  OAF increased the visibility of gays in television like never before.  Moreover, it provided the gold standard for all subsequent gay-themed shows to follow.",5,Queerfolk,1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,3126,"['21st', 'century', 'given', 'much', 'LGBT', 'community', 'Equal', 'marriage', 'rights', 'progress', 'slowly', 'yet', 'steadily', 'Never', 'there', 'been', 'such', 'acceptance', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'Artistically', 've', 'made', 'stamp', 'cultural', 'history', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'been', 'L', 'Word', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'yes', 'most', 'revolutionary', 'Queer', 'Folk.OAF', 'did', 'two', 'things', 'catapulted', 'series', 'lasting', 'permanence', 'was', 'first', 'TV', 'series', 'embrace', 'gay', 'male', 'sexuality', 'episode', 'wasn', 't', 'OAF', 'episode', 'failed', 'contain', 'prerequisite', 'highly', 'stylized', 'sex', 'scene', 'OAF', 'confronted', 'straight', 'America', 's', 'queasiness', 'gay', 'sex', 'head', 'result', 'gay', 'sexuality', 'film', 'TV', 'today', 'much', 'more', 'prevalent', 'thanks', 'OAF', 's', 'trailblazing', 'efforts.Even', 'more', 'revolutionary', 'was', 'OAF', 's', 'insistence', 'showing', 'everyday', 'struggles', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'different', 'faced', 'straight', 'people', 'series', 'touched', 'so', 'many', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'depth', 'richness', 'characters', 'created', 'compelling', 'drama', 'Second', 'acting', 'talent', 'show', 'was', 'top-rate', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'now', 'immensely', 'talented', 'actors/actresses', 'who', 'started', 'series', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'recognized', 'acting', 'merits.OAF', 's', 'characters', 'spanned', 'horizon', 'gaydom', 'had', 'iconic', 'alpha-gay', 'Brian', 'Kenney', 'irrepressible', 'nelly', 'queen', 'Emmett', 'Honeycutt', 'addiction-plagued', 'accountant/opera', 'lover', 'Ted', 'Schmidt', 'boyish', 'comic-book', 'expert', 'secret', 'love', 'Brian', 'Michael', 'Novotny', 'even', 'HIV', '+', 'academic', 'Ben', 'who', 'could', 'forget', 'shining', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'Debbie', 'Novotny', 'foul-mouthed', 'feisty', 'defender', 'queers', 'everywhere', 'credit', 'show', 'gave', 'space', 'gay', 'women', 'as', 'well', 'Melanie', 'Lindsay', 's', 'tortured', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'salvaged', 'relationship', 'lent', 'series', 'added', 'gravity', 'short', 'OAF', 's', 'diverse', 'characters', 'proved', 'just', 'how', 'open-ended', 'gay', 'identity', 'is.The', 'show', 'explored', 'conflicts', 'universal', 'nature', 'was', 'Brian', 's', 'chronic', 'promiscuity', 'reluctance', 'commit', 'nubile', 'teen', 'lover', 'Justin', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'spanned', 'bases', 'lustful', 'infatuation', 'final', 'albeit', 'reluctant', 'commitment', 'show', 's', 'credit', 'Brian', 'Justin', 's', 'relationship', 'portrayed', 'reality', 'many', 'gay', 'couples', 'face', 'other', 'hand', 'Ben', 'Michael', 's', 'relationship', 'showed', 'committed', 'gay', 'couples', 'face', 'same', 'straight', 'couple', 'would', 'marital', 'strife', 'child', 'adoption', 'problems', 'etc', 'stories', 'Emmett', 'Ted', 'also', 'embraced', 'variety', 'universal', 'situations', 'Emmett', 'overcame', 'self-loathing', 'become', 'show', 's', 'proudest', 'fiercest', 'queer', 'Ted', 'was', 'show', 's', 'everyday', 'queer', 'one', 'who', 'struggled', 'problems', 'addiction', 'low', 'self-esteem.In', 'conclusion', 'OAF', 'tapped', 'myriad', 'relevant', 'issues', 'Parental', 'acceptance', 'school', 'bullies', 'intergenerational', 'relationships', 'were', 'few', 'OAF', 'increased', 'visibility', 'gays', 'television', 'never', 'before', 'Moreover', 'provided', 'gold', 'standard', 'subsequent', 'gay-themed', 'shows', 'follow']",N/A
1097291,A1WHKR23N2DAP,B000UX6TK2,Brian Young,"[0, 0]","Let me start off by saying that this is a review of the show and not this set.The show, overall, is great. It is well developed, with somewhat archetypal characters. However, unlike some other stories, these characters don't have the stereotypical stories attached to them. Whoever made these characters developed the story somewhat realistically, which is much appreciated. The stories go beyond boy likes boy and they have sex and get together forever. The show deals with reality a little bit more, which is what makes this show better than some others which revolve around gay men, especially at the time when it was made.However... I know half the gay community would kill me for saying this... but i really got annoyed with Brian and Justin over time. Their relationship went in a loop over and over again where one didn't want to be together and the other did, and then this would switch. And the whole time, both of them were just hiding their emotions from each other. It just generally annoyed me what they did to Justin's character after the first season or two (whenever he became a dick to imitate Brian).However, the other developments make this show 100% worth watching. Michael and Ben's relationship (and even David's in the first season) always seems perfect and just is the stability in the show among the chaos. Emmett is such a great character overall, as is Ted. Their relationship seemed awkward, but as characters, they are both great and represent different sides of the gay spectrum. And then Lindsay and Melanie are absolutely perfect as a couple. They fit well together in the show, and they add a sense of realness and chemistry to the show (they also break up all the m/m sex, which is good or bad depending on who's watching). And then Debbie, of course, is the perfect Pittsburgh mom. She plays her role perfectly and fits so well as a final component to the story.Overall, a great show, minus Justin and Brian, in my opinion.",4,Good... with some flaws...,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,1958,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'review', 'show', 'not', 'set.The', 'show', 'overall', 'great', 'well', 'developed', 'somewhat', 'archetypal', 'characters', 'However', 'other', 'stories', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stereotypical', 'stories', 'attached', 'Whoever', 'made', 'characters', 'developed', 'story', 'somewhat', 'realistically', 'much', 'appreciated', 'stories', 'go', 'boy', 'likes', 'boy', 'have', 'sex', 'get', 'together', 'forever', 'show', 'reality', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'what', 'show', 'better', 'others', 'revolve', 'gay', 'men', 'especially', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'made.However', 'know', 'gay', 'community', 'would', 'kill', 'saying', 'i', 'really', 'got', 'annoyed', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'time', 'relationship', 'went', 'loop', 'over', 'again', 'where', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'together', 'other', 'did', 'then', 'would', 'switch', 'whole', 'time', 'were', 'just', 'hiding', 'emotions', 'other', 'just', 'generally', 'annoyed', 'what', 'did', 'Justin', 'character', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'became', 'dick', 'imitate', 'Brian', '.However', 'other', 'developments', 'make', 'show', '100', '%', 'worth', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Ben', 'relationship', 'even', 'David', 'first', 'season', 'always', 'perfect', 'just', 'stability', 'show', 'chaos', 'Emmett', 'such', 'great', 'character', 'overall', 'Ted', 'relationship', 'seemed', 'awkward', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'represent', 'different', 'sides', 'gay', 'spectrum', 'then', 'Lindsay', 'Melanie', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'couple', 'fit', 'well', 'together', 'show', 'add', 'sense', 'realness', 'chemistry', 'show', 'also', 'break', 'up', 'm/m', 'sex', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'who', 'watching', 'then', 'Debbie', 'course', 'perfect', 'Pittsburgh', 'mom', 'role', 'perfectly', 'fits', 'so', 'well', 'final', 'component', 'story.Overall', 'great', 'show', 'Justin', 'Brian', 'opinion']",N/A

The first season was pretty cool, even though the emphasis on drug use and explicit language was very much overdone-I've had friends with sailor mouths, but here, it was over the top.2nd season toned things down somewhat, aside from some silly plot lines, except Justin surviving/recovering from his attack, and the homophobic SOB essentially getting off with a slap on the wrist.3rd season is probably one of my favorites, homophobic candidate running for mayor of Pittsburgh, with the support of...gasp! Brian Kinney?! Once again, a couple ridiculous sub-plot lines, but I adore the finale, probably the happiest moment in the series, not many more can top it. Plus the music in the background fits the mood perfectly.4th season had mostly a good script, Brian's cancer-not wanting anyone including Justin to know, couldn't stand Brian's mother, who was the persona of religious homophobic parenting. A few scenes with Ben and Michael were pretty heartwarming, always puts a smile on my face, regaining my hope that I too will eventually find my partner-be it a guy and/or a girl.5th season, this season started off so well-Justin went to New York, tried to make his comic Rage into a movie, shut down by a conservative hollywood...hmmm, what else is new? What really made this season tragic for me was the nightclub explosion, and almost everything afterwards, esp. the memorial: when Debbie announces Michael will survive, and the homophobic bigot almost mirrors WBC, I wanted to beat him senseless, but Ben beat me to it! What made scene this tolerable was no one tried to stop Ben, even the police! When Lindsay and Melanie decide to move to Canada, things really went downhill, even though after Melanie's speech about homophobia, I can certainly empathize. The writers wrapped things up w/out finding the nightclub bombers, although I guess they assumed we already knew. For all its flaws, the characters, storylines, unresolved conflicts, etc. it helped set the stage for here!tv, and everything after it, so for that alone, I will always praise it.",4,Why don't I own the series?

It's just a shame it had to end only 5 years in, but it's probably for the better that the show went out on top, and that it did it with style.  Another great thing about this show is that it doesn't judge its characters and the things they do, because hey, it's human.Probably one of, if not the best television series out there, this show is extremely addictive, and it knows how to pull the strings of your heart, and make you laugh, feel anger, and cry.

Watching the series is like watching a fifty minute movie, with an ensemble of actors who knew their craft, and a bunch of writers who knew how to write for the cable audience. Nothing like it was on TV before, and nothing like it will ever be seen again.""Queer as Folk"" ran for five seasons on Showtime, and it immediately became a hit, not only with the gay audience that it was targeted to, but also with the straight community, who fell in love with Brian, Justin, Michael, Ben, Ted, Emmett, Linday, Melonie, and Debbie. Most of the cast were unknowns when the series started, except for the splendid Sharon Gless. Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman adapted the series from Britain, and Americanized it.Many stories were told during the run of the show from AIDS, coming out, gift seeking, cancer, rights of lesbian mothers, internet porn, drug addiction, and more, but the one thing ""Queer as Folk"" had going for it was realism: the producers showed a lot of gay sex, but it was their way of hooking the audience. They realized once they grabbed the viewers attention and once they viewed the characters lives, they would become hooked, and they did.The breakout star of ""Queer as Folk"" was Gale Harold who played Brian Kinney, the guy with no aplogies and no regrets. He would eventually find work on ""Desperate Houswives"" once the series was over. Most of the cast pretty much disappeared from view after the series got canned, except for Gale and Sharon Gless, who would go on to an Emmy nominated performance on Nip/Tuck, as well as a regular on cable's ""Burn Notice"". ""Queer as Folk"" got cancelled because the producers felt five years was enough, and they didn't have any more ideas for future stories. Also, it was getting expensive for Showtime to produce a one hour weekly cable show, and some of the cast announced they wouldn't return for any more seasons.Sadly, Hal Sparks, who played Micheal, stated in the fall of 2008 that there will never be a ""Queer as Folk"" reunion movie because many of the cast members didn't get along with each other and the producers. Rumor has it Gale Harold and Randy Harrison were the ones Sparks was referring to.This particular boxset contains all 83 episodes of the series, along with all the bonus features featured on the individual boxsets. There is also a bonus disc that features most of the cast at a breakfast held in late 2007, bringing the cast together for the first time since the series folded in 2005. Absent are Gale Harold and Randy Harrison. If you already have the individual boxsets I would suggest in passing on this set, but if you have the extra cash buy it. Just be forwarned though: many buyers have complained that the dics become dislogged in shipping and arrive scratched. If you haven't got any of the ""Queer as Folk"" boxsets buy this collection as it will save you money compared to buying the series individually.",4,"""Great Show, but The Packaging Isn't All That Great!""",1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,2956,"['Queer', 'Folk', 'greatest', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'broadcast', 'Watching', 'series', 'watching', 'fifty', 'minute', 'movie', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'who', 'knew', 'craft', 'bunch', 'writers', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'write', 'cable', 'audience', 'Nothing', 'was', 'TV', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'ran', 'five', 'seasons', 'Showtime', 'immediately', 'became', 'hit', 'not', 'only', 'gay', 'audience', 'was', 'targeted', 'also', 'straight', 'community', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'Michael', 'Ben', 'Ted', 'Emmett', 'Linday', 'Melonie', 'Debbie', 'Most', 'cast', 'were', 'unknowns', 'when', 'series', 'started', 'splendid', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'Ron', 'Cowen', 'Daniel', 'Lipman', 'adapted', 'series', 'Britain', 'Americanized', 'it.Many', 'stories', 'were', 'told', 'run', 'show', 'AIDS', 'coming', 'out', 'gift', 'seeking', 'cancer', 'rights', 'lesbian', 'mothers', 'internet', 'porn', 'drug', 'addiction', 'more', 'one', 'thing', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'realism', 'producers', 'showed', 'lot', 'gay', 'sex', 'was', 'way', 'hooking', 'audience', 'realized', 'once', 'grabbed', 'viewers', 'attention', 'once', 'viewed', 'characters', 'lives', 'would', 'become', 'hooked', 'did.The', 'star', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'was', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'who', 'played', 'Brian', 'Kinney', 'guy', 'aplogies', 'regrets', 'would', 'eventually', 'find', 'work', 'Desperate', 'Houswives', 'once', 'series', 'was', 'over', 'Most', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'disappeared', 'view', 'series', 'got', 'canned', 'Gale', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'Emmy', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Nip/Tuck', 'as', 'well', 'regular', 'cable', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'got', 'cancelled', 'producers', 'felt', 'five', 'years', 'was', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'ideas', 'future', 'stories', 'Also', 'was', 'getting', 'expensive', 'Showtime', 'produce', 'one', 'hour', 'cable', 'show', 'cast', 'announced', 'would', ""n't"", 'return', 'more', 'seasons.Sadly', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'who', 'played', 'Micheal', 'stated', 'fall', '2008', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'reunion', 'movie', 'many', 'cast', 'members', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'other', 'producers', 'Rumor', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'were', 'ones', 'Sparks', 'was', 'referring', 'to.This', 'particular', 'boxset', '83', 'episodes', 'series', 'bonus', 'features', 'featured', 'individual', 'boxsets', 'also', 'bonus', 'disc', 'most', 'cast', 'breakfast', 'held', 'late', '2007', 'bringing', 'cast', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'series', 'folded', '2005', 'Absent', 'are', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'already', 'have', 'individual', 'boxsets', 'would', 'suggest', 'passing', 'set', 'have', 'extra', 'cash', 'buy', 'Just', 'be', 'forwarned', 'many', 'buyers', 'have', 'complained', 'dics', 'become', 'dislogged', 'shipping', 'arrive', 'scratched', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'buy', 'collection', 'will', 'save', 'money', 'compared', 'buying', 'series', 'individually']",N/A

The series is based upon the British television series of the same name and follows the lives of four gay and two lesbian friends that along with a few others make up an artificial family.  This family lives in Pittsburg, PN and the series focuses primarly on their relationships as friends as well as the romantic entanglements they get themselves involved in within the five years of the series.The inaugural season focuses upon establishing the key characters for the series.  At the center of the series are boyhood friends Michael (the essential `boy-next-door') and Brian Kenny (A Tom Cat that has slept with more men that he could possibly count).  From there the characters branch out to include Emmett (a very flamboyant, yet comfortable with himself), Ted (the most closeted and republican member of the group and the lesbian's Melanie and Lindsey.  From their the characters branch out to include Michael's almost overly accepting Mother, Debbie (who works at the groups hangout diner) and her brother Vic (a older gay man infected with the HIV virus).The pilot perfectly sets the stage for the series as Brian meets Justin, a underage boy that makes him think about his lifestyle as well as the birth of the Melanie and Lindsey's son.  From there the series branches off into a character study of four contemporary gay men, just trying to live their lives.  They aren't trying to make any gradeoso statements about homosexuality - they are just trying to find love in a crazy and sometimes harsh world.  And beyond love - all they really want is acceptance.""Queer as Folk"" was the first series in America to bluntly discuss the life of homosexuals.  And it did so in a very entertaining and engrossing way.  Even heterosexual's found themselves drawn into dramatic intalgements of the series.  And beyond the drama, this series is a perfect time capsule of what life was to be gay in America at the turn of the century.  Paramount has collected all 78-episodes on 28 discs with all the original bonus features intact.  Additionally they have included a bonus disc with a retrospective featurette that reunited all the cast members for the first time since the filming of the series finale.",5,Welcome to Liberty Avenue,1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,2293,"['Queer', 'Folk', 'one', 'amazing', 'series', 'perfect', 'time', 'capsule', 'time', 'series', 'based', 'British', 'television', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'lives', 'four', 'gay', 'two', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'few', 'others', 'make', 'up', 'artificial', 'family', 'family', 'Pittsburg', 'PN', 'series', 'primarly', 'relationships', 'as', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'get', 'involved', 'five', 'years', 'series.The', 'inaugural', 'season', 'establishing', 'key', 'characters', 'series', 'center', 'series', 'are', 'boyhood', 'friends', 'Michael', 'essential', 'boy-next-door', 'Brian', 'Kenny', 'A', 'Tom', 'Cat', 'slept', 'more', 'men', 'could', 'possibly', 'count', 'characters', 'branch', 'out', 'include', 'Emmett', 'very', 'flamboyant', 'yet', 'comfortable', 'Ted', 'most', 'closeted', 'republican', 'member', 'group', 'lesbian', 'Melanie', 'Lindsey', 'characters', 'branch', 'out', 'include', 'Michael', 'almost', 'overly', 'accepting', 'Mother', 'Debbie', 'who', 'groups', 'hangout', 'diner', 'brother', 'Vic', 'older', 'gay', 'man', 'infected', 'HIV', 'virus', 'pilot', 'perfectly', 'stage', 'series', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'underage', 'boy', 'think', 'lifestyle', 'as', 'well', 'birth', 'Melanie', 'Lindsey', 'son', 'series', 'character', 'study', 'four', 'contemporary', 'gay', 'men', 'just', 'trying', 'live', 'lives', 'are', ""n't"", 'trying', 'make', 'gradeoso', 'statements', 'homosexuality', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'find', 'love', 'crazy', 'sometimes', 'harsh', 'world', 'love', 'really', 'want', 'acceptance', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'was', 'first', 'series', 'America', 'bluntly', 'discuss', 'life', 'homosexuals', 'did', 'so', 'very', 'entertaining', 'engrossing', 'way', 'Even', 'heterosexual', 'found', 'drawn', 'dramatic', 'intalgements', 'series', 'drama', 'series', 'perfect', 'time', 'capsule', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'be', 'gay', 'America', 'turn', 'century', 'Paramount', 'collected', '78-episodes', '28', 'discs', 'original', 'bonus', 'features', 'intact', 'Additionally', 'have', 'included', 'bonus', 'disc', 'retrospective', 'featurette', 'reunited', 'cast', 'members', 'first', 'time', 'filming', 'series', 'finale']",N/A
