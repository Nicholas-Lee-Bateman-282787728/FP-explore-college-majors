957433,A3BGLVC6OZM2JW,B000CDSS22,"douglas barton ""emotions in motion""","[26, 43]","this may be getting out of hand. I, along with the countless other "" As Time Goes By "" fanatics, had eagerly anticipated this "" Reunion Special "" but must admit to being slightly disappointed with the finished product and how each character has slowly developed over the years. Granted long-time fans of "" ATGB "" will no doubt be greatly miffed but I do feel that this special ( filmed in Feb. 2005 ) doesn't quite live up to its expectations. Truth be known I found myself somewhat cheated by its contents and found it left me with a nagging feeling as though a wonderful opportunity had been lost.I guess a good place to begin would be...well, at the beginning! Don't misunderstand me but the idea of Jean ( played by the wonderful Judi Dench of course ) purchasing and having delivered two baby cribs before either daughter Judith or Sandy have announced that they were even expecting is beyond silly. I cannot think of any sane woman behaving in this fashion and it seems to be unnecessarily calculated. No doubt long-time fans will find it humrous but, sadly, I found it just plain silly. One of this shows greatest strengths as always been that the characters never resorted to cheap sitcom tricks for laughs. Now, theres an obvious tie-in later in the show of course and any long time viewer could probably see what was coming down the pipe long before the happy announcement is pronounced. Granted though to give credit where credit is due Lionels dream sequence was an absolute hoot! Sadly though adding to the problem is poor Lionel ( Geoffrey Palmer ) whose character is written as little more then a befuddled, confused senior who hasn't a clue as to what is going on under his very own roof. Lionel is constantly nagged and berated by wife Jean and seems, not only, completely clueless but perennially whipped by the very women he lives with. I do understand the comedic aspect of writing the sitcom in this way but Lionels character is so completely toothless that he may as well be put out to pasture. Sadly, adding to the ever growing problems is how Bob Lareby has written the role of Jean as one who seems constantly in a foul mood and seems to forever snap at those around her. Mr. Lareby's Jean Pargetter as  is the grand matriarch of this family and while, in itself, that is fine lately her role has been reduced to behaving perennially peevish and somewhat ill-tempered. I've no doubt that she loves Lionel and her extended family but why write her such as way that comes across as overly antagonistic.The rest of the first episode runs along smoothly and the scenes that seem to work the best is of course Lionel and new son-in-law Alistair ( Philip Bretherton ) budding friendship. These two do work extremly well together and their visit to a local fertility specialist for Alistair is well-written. Theres a genuine spark between these two actors and you can actually sense the grand time that the two are having. Sadly though the same cannot be said for Alistair and new wife Judith ( Moira Brooker ). Maybe others can see somthing I do not but there is simply not one spark of energy between these two characters. Their scenes together, while vitally important to the Reunion Special, are lacking any and all initmacy and seem oddly perfuntory. I cannot imagine how any couple could function when they lack such a key ingrediant as chemistry but who am I to say? Alistair comes across as energized and always full of Joie de Vivre but alas Judith ( perhaps taking after her mother Jean ) seems without an ounce of humour and quick to dampen down any sense of true spirit. I enjoy the role of Judith but there is little there that leads me to believe that someone of Alistairs charisma would find even remotely attractive. Sorry but for me I simply do not buy into this rather convenient marriage and that they truly love each other. Happily the episode ends with glad news from Sandy ( a vivacious Jenny Funnell ) and hubby Harry. As for me I've always felt as though the role of Sandy was much more interesting then Judith and would like to have seen more of her.The second episode starts with a bang but ( with apologies to T.S. Eliot ) ends with a whimper. The startling news of Lionel having a son back in Kenya was priceless and I never saw it coming. Initially I thought it was rather risque of Mr. Lareby to write such a scene that might be considered very controversial by long-time fans of ATGB but sadly it was quickly wrapped up all nice and tidy and never mined for the comedic gold that might have been found if they have workd it just a little longer. Neverhteless, Judi Dench does a classic take upon hearing of Lionels newfound off-spring and for a few minutes there  I thought the show had finally found itself again. Of course this is where Jeans long-time sister-in-law Penny and her sad sack husband Stephen come into play and its a welcome change to find the role of Penny add a little life to the proceedings. The character of Penny has always been a bit of a tornado in this show and I always seem to enjoy her blowing in like a hurricane. There is a definite need in this series for a character of adds just a little of a sparing match between them and Jean/Lionel and Penny does this in spades. She may not be one who you would invite into your very own home but in this instance she is very welcome indeed. Adding to the festivities is a small case of harmless fun by Sandy and Judith regarding two shopping bags and its naughty contents and the show finally felt as though it was on sure footing.Sadly, it ends hapharzedly with a call that Lionels father was in a nearby hospital and finishes off on a sour note. Sorry folks but the never-ending role of Rocky should have been retired years ago and his character, while many will no doubt find humorous, has been reduced to silly, contrived scenes where he and new wife Madge ( she mysteriously was absent from these proceedings! ) act like unruly children. I do understand that many will disagree here but why it is in televison land that seniors are written as though they were rambunctious five year olds who seem forever playful? Its a sitcom trick that apparently even the folks at ATGB are not above. Have them skydiving, linedancing or some other silly nonsense and get a cheap laugh.Overall, what to think of the Reunion Special? While I did enjoy seeing my favorite televison/extended family once again I do feel as though somehow an opportunity has been lost. Fact remains that the reason for the success of "" ATGB "" isn't necessarily the scripts, which seem to possess some appeal, but the enormous talent pool that brings them to life each and every episode. The last scene we view is Lionel, sitting in the hospital waiting room, once again befuddled and seemingly lost as to what is going on around him, pretty much says it all. I too was befuddled, confused and slightly ill-at-ease as to what I'd just witnessed but was also found eagerly anticipating much more. But I guess thats what families are all about.",3,A Kiss May Still Be A Kiss But...,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,7031,"['may', 'be', 'getting', 'hand', 'countless', 'other', 'Time', 'Goes',

It's done as a 2 part 45 minutes each story, with both young couples Alistair and Judith and Harry and Sandy returning to the Hardcastle home with the usually newlywed worries, the former worried that they can't have a baby, and the latter about to have one while Harry looks for a promotion.  With their usually humor, the old 50s vintage couple of Lionel and Jean set them both right.  The climax comes at the end of part 1 when a handsome young Kenyan comes calling to see ""his father"".  This gets resolved right away in part 2 as it turns out he's part of a large family that looked to Lionel as a father for putting up money for them to live while living there.  Now he's an intern at the local London hospital.  Eventually, Steven and Penny (Jean's first husband's sibling and in-law), Rocky (Lionel's father) and Mrs. Bale (Rocky's housekeeper) show up to had more fun to this warm hearted return to a series that ran a decade on BBC and PBS and continues to rerun in many cities here.

In fact, the entire cast returned for two brand new episodes with a new storyline.DVD running time: 1 hr. 35 min.Returning: Judi Dench, Geoffrey Palmer, Moira Brooker, Philip Bretherton, Jenny Funnell, Daniel Ryan, Moyra Fraser, Paul Chapman, Janet Henfrey, Frank Middlemass.Jean Hardcastle is very excited that Judy & Alistair, as well as, Sandy & Harry are returning for a visit.  In fact, jean has prepared a bedroom by buying 2 baby cribs.  None of the girls are pregnant yet, however Jean wants to be ready for future grandchilden and hopes Judy has an announcement to make.Lionel is being much more sensible about this, but Jean wants Lionel to have a man to man chat with Alistair.Lionel gets a surprise visit from Patrick (David Oyelowd).  Penny, Stephen, Rocky and Mrs. Bale also come by to visit.This DVD set also includes 8 1/2 minutes of very funny blooper and outtakes from the original run of the tv series and reunion special and a behind the scenes featurette.Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer also appeared together in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and Mrs. Brown (1997).Let's hope for many more reunions!Note: In the United States, ""As Time Goes By"" is a very popular tv series and is still broadcast on the PBS Network.

957452,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CDSS22,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 7]","Once upon a time, in 1953 to be specific, a young British army officer and an equally young student nurse enjoyed a three-month affair.  Then he was shipped off to Korea and they lost touch with each other.  However, thirty-eight years later they run into each other.  Lionel Hardcastle (Geoffrey Palmer) is a widower working on his memoirs about his life in Kenya (entitled ""My Life in Kenya""), while Jean Pargetter (Judi Dench) runs a secretarial service.  Also part of the fun is Jean's daughter Judy (Moira Brooker), Sandy (Jenny Funnell) the secretary at Judy's business, and Alistair Deacon (Philip Bretherton).  The courting part was the best of times for the series as the old lovers rediscovered each other and built a new relationship on the foundation of the old.  After Jean and Lionel finally married it turned into more of a traditional domestic comedy and the romantic focus shifted to Judy and Alistair, but it was always the old couple that was the most heartwarming.The series debuted on BBC-1 on January 12, 1992 and the final episode aired August 11, 2002.  Both the first and last episodes were entitled ""You Must Remember This...,"" although the latter was a clip show.  There was a reunion episode on December 3, 2005 where Jean's hopes for grandchildren are threatened by Judy's concern that Alistair might not be able to be a father.  This particular reunion special originally aired in two parts on December 26 and 30, 2005, and finds Jean and Lionel home alone.  I suppose I should not have been surprised that the reunion special for ""As Time Goes By"" would be such a low-keyed affair.  The idea of Lionel writing the second part of his memoirs beginning when he and Jean rediscovered each other becomes the catalyst for taking a trip down memory lane courtesy of various clips from choice episodes.  The net result is not great, but it is certainly a pleasant evening spent with a couple of warmly remembered characters as we get a sense of touching base with Jean and Lionel.A nice touch with this DVD is that they include actual episodes to go along with the reunion, because the clips are just enough to whet your appetite for more and unless you have the complete run of the show on DVD you would be out of luck.  Included are:  Series 1, Episode 3 (""The Copper Kettle""), finds Lionel and Jean going back to where they first met only to discover that things have changed since 1953.

957459,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B000CDSS22,Matthew Gladney,"[211, 216]","""As Time Goes By"" is the gentle, funny story of Jean Pargetter and Lionel Hardcastle, two people who used to be in love in the early fifties. When Lionel went off to fight in the Korean War, the two lost touch. They meet again 38 years later, quite by accident, and what is at first an awkward friendship slowly morphs into a warm romance.The show first aired in 1992, and continued production through 2002. A lot had transpired in the lives of Jean & Lionel and their ever-growing extended family during those ten years, and the series ended with Jean's daughter Judith marrying her on-again, off-again book publisher boyfriend, Alistair Deacon. Jean's secretary Sandy moved to Canada with her boyfriend Harry for a one-year attachment to the Royal Mounties.The Reunion Special DVD consists of two 45 minute episodes produced in February 2005, which pick-up where the end of the series left off. Judith and Alistair are trying to have kids, with nothing to show for it, and Sandy & Harry are back from Canada, with Harry wanting to try out for a dangerous police job, much to Sandy's dismay. An unexpected visitor arrives from Lionel's past, which causes a minor stir. Many of the old favorite supporting characters are back, including Penny & Stephen, Rocky and Mrs. Bale.I enjoyed the two specials quite a bit. They came as a welcome return to form after the last series (season) of the show. That series was only four episodes, and felt rushed. One of the hallmarks of ""As Time Goes By"" is its slow, gentle pace. That is once again on full display here with these two specials. The first 45 minute episode is probably the better of the two. It has a little more plot than the second episode, although both are generally good. My main qualm comes with the end of episode two (which, at this point, constitues the end of series). It relies a bit too much on coincidence for my tastes, but that is a relatively minor quibble.It's rare to find such a consistently well-produced and entertaining show as ""As Time Goes By."" The writing, acting and directing have almost always been top-notch, and it's a pleasure to have these two new specials. In fact, we're treated to even further deepening and exploration of the Lionel character through the arrival of the person from his past, a feat which isn't often accomplished 13 years after a character has been introduced. It's yet another testament to the quality viewing experience that is ""As Time Goes By.""",4,A Return to Form,1134086400,"12 9, 2005",2005,2454,"['Time', 'Goes', 'gentle', 'funny', 'story', 'Jean', 'Pargetter', 'Lionel', 'Hardcastle', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'love', 'early', 'fifties', 'When', 'Lionel', 'went', 'fight', 'Korean', 'War', 'two', 'lost', 'touch', 'meet', 'again', '38', 'years', 'later', 'quite', 'accident', 'what', 'first', 'awkward', 'friendship', 'slowly', 'warm', 'romance.The', 'show', 'first', 'aired', '1992', 'continued', 'production', '2002', 'lot', 'had', 'transpired', 'lives', 'Jean', 'Lionel', 'ever-growing', 'extended', 'family', 'ten', 'years', 'series', 'ended', 'Jean', 'daughter', 'Judith', 'marrying', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'book', 'publisher', 'boyfriend', 'Alistair', 'Deacon', 'Jean', 'secretary', 'Sandy', 'moved', 'Canada', 'boyfriend', 'Harry', 'one-year', 'attachment', 'Royal', 'Mounties.The', 'Reunion', 'Special', 'DVD', 'two', '45', 'minute', 'episodes', 'produced', 'February', '2005', 'pick-up', 'where', 'end', 'series', 'left', 'off', 'Judith', 'Alistair', 'are', 'trying', 'have', 'kids', 'nothing', 'show', 'Sandy', 'Harry', 'are', 'back', 'Canada', 'Harry', 'wanting', 'try', 'out', 'dangerous', 'police', 'job', 'much', 'Sandy', 'dismay', 'unexpected', 'visitor', 'Lionel', 'past', 'minor', 'stir', 'Many', 'old', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'including', 'Penny', 'Stephen', 'Rocky', 'Mrs.', 'Bale.I', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'specials', 'quite', 'bit', 'came', 'welcome', 'return', 'form', 'last', 'series', 'season', 'show', 'series', 'was', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'felt', 'rushed', 'One', 'hallmarks', 'Time', 'Goes', 'slow', 'gentle', 'pace', 'once', 'again', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'two', 'specials', 'first', '45', 'minute', 'episode', 'probably', 'better', 'two', 'little', 'more', 'plot', 'second', 'episode', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'main', 'qualm', 'end', 'episode', 'two', 'point', 'end', 'series', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'coincidence', 'tastes', 'relatively', 'minor', 'quibble.It', 'rare', 'find', 'such', 'consistently', 'well-produced', 'entertaining', 'show', 'Time', 'Goes', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'have', 'almost', 'always', 'been', 'top-notch', 'pleasure', 'have', 'two', 'new', 'specials', 'fact', ""'re"", 'treated', 'even', 'further', 'deepening', 'exploration', 'Lionel', 'character', 'arrival', 'person', 'past', 'feat', ""n't"", 'often', 'accomplished', '13', 'years', 'character', 'been', 'introduced', 'yet', 'testament', 'quality', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Time', 'Goes']",N/A
957460,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B000CDSS22,Ms Winston,"[48, 58]","I received my copy of the ""As Time Goes By - Reunion Special"" this week and watched it last night. My title pretty much says it all - flawed but fun (in spots). In trying to put my finger on the major problems that I encountered in watching the program, I came to the conclusion that it lacked much of the charm of the original series. As others wrote, this DVD is not a good introduction to the series, and is primarily aimed at fans who are already committed to the characters.Jean, as played by Judy Dench since the inception of the series several years ago, has always had her annoying moments. Her logic is frequently flawed and she never learns to keep her nose out of other people's business. But those who are long-time viewers are used to her quirks, although her purchase of the two baby cribs in advance of anyone being pregnant, is even a little over the top for her. She flies around the set like a demented butterfly, for no purpose other than to be ditzy. For years we have heard Lionel tell Jean how beautiful he found her when they met, and still finds her, yet from her reaction one would have thought she had just heard it for the first time.Lionel and Sandy continue to be the most down-to-earth of the regulars, and as usual didn't disappoint this viewer. I have never liked the character of Penny, Jean's sister-in-law, but for once she seemed almost like a tonic played against Jean's extreme silliness. Penny's husband, Steven, IMO deserves a new wife: younger, sexier, and more tolerant. If there is another special in the offing, which seems likely from the last few minutes of this program, I hope they ditch Penny, along with Rocky, Lionel's ancient father.And that brings me to the biggest problem with the special, at least in my opinion: only a couple of years are supposed to have passed since the end of the regular series and the reunion stories, but the actors have aged in the normal manner, since in real time it has been several years since the final season. Phillip Bretherton, who plays Alistair, now has very grey, almost white, hair, which is quite attractive, but makes the passage of real time more obvious. Lionel, and the actor who plays his father, now look the same age, which is jarring.Not to be morbid about it, but we die-hard fans know that this lightweight special is something precious, for as the principal actors age a reunion special ten years hence may not be in the cards.

Jean and Lionel are a prickly old couple, with Jean an over-the-top ditzy mum, Lionel the long-suffering husband, and the middle-aged ""kids"" finally beginning their lives away from the nest. Alistair has become an insufferable caricature, Rocky and Mrs. Bale are just bizarre, and Penny and Steven possibly the most realistic, but not terribly likable.On the other hand, if you have been following the series, this is a visit from old friends and you'll forgive their eccentricities. The stories are unlikely, with Jean anticipating both Sandy and Judith having babies soon, though as far as she knows, neither is planning a family. Alistair is freaking out because Judith isn't pregnant and she thinks he's to blame. Sandy and Harry are back from Canada and Harry is applying for a dangerous post with the police, to Sandy's dismay. A character from Kenya turns up to visit Lionel. Hilarity ensues.Fans of the series will enjoy catching up with the gang and the story is almost secondary to seeing how they look since the ""final"" series.",4,For Fans Only,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,1188,"['were', 'watch', 'As', 'Time', 'Goes', 'Reunion', 'Specials', 'having', 'seen', 'series', 'up', 'now', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'take', 'characters', 'Jean', 'Lionel', 'are', 'prickly', 'old', 'couple', 'Jean', 'over-the-top', 'ditzy', 'mum', 'Lionel', 'long-suffering', 'husband', 'middle-aged', 'kids', 'finally', 'beginning', 'lives', 'away', 'nest', 'Alistair', 'become', 'insufferable', 'caricature', 'Rocky', 'Mrs.', 'Bale', 'are', 'just', 'bizarre', 'Penny', 'Steven', 'possibly', 'most', 'realistic', 'not', 'terribly', 'likable.On', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'series', 'visit', 'old', 'friends', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'eccentricities', 'stories', 'are', 'unlikely', 'Jean', 'anticipating', 'Sandy', 'Judith', 'having', 'babies', 'soon', 'as', 'far', 'planning', 'family', 'Alistair', 'freaking', 'out', 'Judith', ""n't"", 'pregnant', 'blame', 'Sandy', 'Harry', 'are', 'back', 'Canada', 'Harry', 'applying', 'dangerous', 'post', 'police', 'Sandy', 'dismay', 'character', 'Kenya', 'up', 'visit', 'Lionel', 'Hilarity', 'ensues.Fans', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy', 'catching', 'up', 'gang', 'story', 'almost', 'secondary', 'seeing', 'how', 'look', 'final', 'series']",N/A

Are they flogging a dead horse ?Well as far as I am concerned, the script stayed true to the original series and it tied everything up beautifully. Ok so the character of Harry changed, but I liked him nonetheless...oh how far they have come in the time the show was written.In fact I was tearful at the end, because I knew this really was then end of an amazingly brilliant and heartwarming episode in British TV.
