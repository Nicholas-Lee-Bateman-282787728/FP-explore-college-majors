940553,A1U29Y7SURFRHQ,B000BCXZVI,Anonymous,"[5, 6]","I was really excited about this DVD after reading the great reviews, but found it very disappointing. Although there are some good exercises in each section there are NOT enough repetitions of each exercise, and I did the entire workout without breaking a sweat. As a very busy working mom, I feel like this hour long workout (plus the 20 minute bonus) is a waste of time, as there are many more challenging and effective toning workouts out there (try Tamilee Webb or Kathy Smith). I guess this workout is probably targeted to an older, less fit audience (which I consider myself a part of), but I have serious doubts that it could get anyone's body into bikini shape. I didn't even feel sore afterward, and wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone who's serious about getting in shape for summer!!",1,"Will Not Get Your Body ""Bikini Ready""",1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,796,"['was', 'really', 'excited', 'DVD', 'reading', 'great', 'reviews', 'found', 'very', 'disappointing', 'are', 'good', 'exercises', 'section', 'are', 'NOT', 'enough', 'repetitions', 'exercise', 'did', 'entire', 'workout', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'very', 'busy', 'working', 'mom', 'feel', 'hour', 'long', 'workout', '20', 'minute', 'bonus', 'waste', 'time', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'challenging', 'effective', 'toning', 'out', 'there', 'try', 'Tamilee', 'Webb', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'guess', 'workout', 'probably', 'targeted', 'older', 'less', 'fit', 'audience', 'consider', 'part', 'have', 'serious', 'doubts', 'could', 'get', 'anyone', 'body', 'bikini', 'shape', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'sore', 'afterward', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'serious', 'getting', 'shape', 'summer']",Shape Toning Workout: Bikini Body All Year-Round

940555,AR5RYQBKKC1UT,B000BCXZVI,Kelly A. Daly,"[38, 39]","This DVD consists of four 15 minute sections:1)BUTT & HIPS: effective standing lunge and squat variations with weights and floorwork.2)ABS: innovative crunch variations and reverse curls that work upper and lower abs and obliques3)THIGHS: all standing exercises (no weights). Not your average squats and lunges - interesting combos and balance moves4)UPPER BODY: you'll need a chair and 2 sets of weights.  You'll work biceps, chest, triceps, shoulders and back.You can choose each segment individually, pick a few or just let the DVD play all the segments and if you do that the order is how I listed it above.  you can also select the order of exercises within each section or let the DVD shuffle the order.Each toning section has 8-10 exercises and they are very effective BUT there is a pause between each set.  The workout stops and you see a Shape screen with a beach.  Then it goes back to the workout and the next exercise.  The pause is only a few seconds but it's annoying and makes the workout choppy.  I guess it has to be that way so you can select the order of exercises.  One exerciser shows modifications and there are tips that pop up onscreen.There is also a 20 minute aerobics section.  I didn't do that, so I can't comment.  I wish there was a stretch section instead of the aerobics.  There is a warm-up and cool down before each segment, but it's less than a minute.

I haven't done the lower body segment.  Based on that, I think this DVD has good, all around, overall toning.  But I didn't find it to be as challenging as I expected.  I also don't think it's worth it for the time.  There are three 15-minute segments, and from the two I did, I think they could have done more multiple muscle movements to give a better workout.  I wouldn't suggest this for the time-pressed.I liked the 20 minute cardio add-on.

That's been around so long because they know what they are talking about and are popular as a result.  This dvd is in two parts.  A short cardio workout, and then mainly a long routine of toning exercises.  This section works abs, legs, arms and hips/buns.  In each of those segments there is 10-12 exercises for each, and you can do them in any order (you can choose to shuffle or play them as they are - this keeps it interesting).  Both of the instructors cue very well and are not annoying like some.  The set is good and light and fun and the only equipment you will need are two sets of weights.  You can choose your level of weights.  This is a good workout that is fun to do.

940560,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000BCXZVI,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[9, 9]","When a workout begins with marching, I start to worry that the exercises are going to be very bouncy and high impact, but the instructors kept the pace up without creating to much bounce. I would not recommend this to anyone with knee or back problems because frankly there are a lot of lunges within the segments that could be of concern. There are also places where you hold weights and bend over at the waist. This definitely requires a strong stomach and back before you begin these exercises.So, with cautions in place, I can say the exercises on this DVD are especially effective for intermediate students who have learned the basic moves from a variety of workouts. You are required to keep up at quite a rapid pace at times with little time to reposition yourself on the floor or you have to be back up standing and ready to go with a new set of exercises. For the beginner, this could become a frustration and no real details are given for specific exercises.The bonuses of this workout are unique moves like the Mountain Climber, which is the Yoga plank pose with leg motion, imagine climbing while facing the floor. Great for balance and upper body strength. The leg swings required a lot of balance and many of the exercises seemed to be super effective. You could feel them working from the first move. The only thing you need is a set of 3-5lb weights. Most of the exercises just use your own body weight.The sections are all interrupted with a Shape ""screen"" which I tried to ignore. It broke up the music, although it gives you a little break between sections. The format while somewhat frustrating, can be endured for the benefit of the toning, firming and strengthening exercises. I went and put on my swimsuit right after I did this workout just to make sure it works. I still fit into last year's swimsuit, but with this new workout I'm thinking new swimsuits. If you have been working out on a consistent basis and then you try a new workout, sometimes you can even see results the first time you try a workout. This one definitely produces added toning and along with dance exercises, Pilates and Yoga, you should see good results.~The Rebecca Review",3,Energetic Routine with Effective Exercises,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2172,"['When', 'workout', 'marching', 'start', 'worry', 'exercises', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'bouncy', 'high', 'impact', 'instructors', 'kept', 'pace', 'up', 'creating', 'much', 'bounce', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'knee', 'back', 'problems', 'frankly', 'are', 'lot', 'lunges', 'segments', 'could', 'be', 'concern', 'are', 'also', 'places', 'where', 'hold', 'weights', 'bend', 'waist', 'definitely', 'strong', 'stomach', 'back', 'begin', 'exercises.So', 'cautions', 'place', 'can', 'say', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'are', 'especially', 'effective', 'intermediate', 'students', 'who', 'have', 'learned', 'basic', 'moves', 'variety', 'workouts', 'are', 'required', 'keep', 'up', 'quite', 'rapid', 'pace', 'times', 'little', 'time', 'reposition', 'floor', 'have', 'be', 'back', 'standing', 'ready', 'go', 'new', 'set', 'exercises', 'beginner', 'could', 'become', 'frustration', 'real', 'details', 'are', 'given', 'specific', 'exercises.The', 'bonuses', 'workout', 'are', 'unique', 'moves', 'Mountain', 'Climber', 'Yoga', 'plank', 'pose', 'leg', 'motion', 'imagine', 'climbing', 'facing', 'floor', 'Great', 'balance', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'leg', 'swings', 'required', 'lot', 'balance', 'many', 'exercises', 'seemed', 'be', 'super', 'effective', 'could', 'feel', 'working', 'first', 'move', 'only', 'thing', 'need', 'set', '3-5lb', 'weights', 'Most', 'exercises', 'just', 'use', 'own', 'body', 'weight.The', 'sections', 'are', 'interrupted', 'Shape', 'screen', 'tried', 'ignore', 'broke', 'up', 'music', 'little', 'break', 'sections', 'format', 'somewhat', 'frustrating', 'can', 'be', 'endured', 'benefit', 'toning', 'firming', 'strengthening', 'exercises', 'went', 'put', 'swimsuit', 'right', 'did', 'workout', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'still', 'fit', 'last', 'year', 'swimsuit', 'new', 'workout', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'new', 'swimsuits', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'consistent', 'basis', 'then', 'try', 'new', 'workout', 'sometimes', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'results', 'first', 'time', 'try', 'workout', 'one', 'definitely', 'added', 'toning', 'dance', 'exercises', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'should', 'see', 'good', 'results.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Shape Toning Workout: Bikini Body All Year-Round
