They want things to improve, but not at any personal cost. The movie does a good job of showing that those of us willing to tut-tut and support magazines, etc. which decry racism, but whom are unwilling to do so in any constructive public way are not much better than those who openly hate. The film also shows Peck really coming to understand the prejudice which he thought of as 'bad' as truly humiliating and career ending. Sadly, a couple of actors in this movie likely had their careers ended at least in part by appearing in the film and then being targeted by McCarthy.

324319,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302640512,Acute Observer,"[0, 3]","Gentleman's Agreement, 1947 filmThe film begins with a scenic view of Manhattan just after WW II. [Recognize the buildings?] A man and his son are visiting. They pass Rockefeller Center. A double-decker bus passes in the background. Schuyler Green has an appointment with the boss of a magazine. He is invited to a dinner party. Phil will write an article on antisemitism. What can he possibly say on this subject? Phil will do his own research. But the story isn't flowing. He needs a new idea, the personal view. His mother needs a heart doctor. [How many doctors smoke today?] Phil can best do research for his story by passing as Jewish! So Phil Green starts his research. Should this subject be publicized? Phil will send letters with different names and test the responses. ""I don't believe in prejudices.""Phil tells Kathy he is Jewish. Her answers are subtle. Jordan is given his orders. Miss Wales offers advice. Phil meets other people on the magazine. Will he meet Kathy's family? Kathy wonders what her circle of friends might say. The word gets around to Tommy. Phil explains his story to Dave Goldman. There is a scene in the restaurant (for drama and action). There is a party in Darien. Kathy and Phil look at her dream house. Their honeymoon may have a problem: the hotel is ""restricted"". Phil learns the truth. The valet takes Phil's bag out. [No tip?] What can one person do? There is danger of ostracism. Tommy learns about prejudice in school. Kathy expresses her opinion.But Phil finishes his story, and shocks Miss Wales. Other people like the story. Does prejudice continue because good people don't object? Would things change if people did something? Dave discusses what makes a good wife with Kathy. Phil's mother reads part of this story, and makes a speech. Kathy finds a house for Dave. Will there be a happy ending for Kathy and Phil?This is an interesting movie for its time. It seems like a low-budget movie because of its story. There is one scene near the end where ""Phil Green"" says ""Miss Williams"" instead of ""Miss Wales"", but this is not corrected by redoing the scene. This story tells about life in the New York city area for the upper middle-class. Overall, it exposes human error or prejudgment. Would such a report ""do any good""? No, not unless it leads to changes in the laws. The ""Muckrakers"" around 1907 provided reports that led to the Pure Food and Drug Act, the popular election of US Senators (XVII Amendment), etc. Those were conditions that affected most people. I think most people are never happy unless they have somebody or something to hate.

324320,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,6302640512,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[9, 12]","Gentleman's Agreement is Elia Kazan's film from 1947 that stars Gregory Peck as a writer (Green) who pretends to be Jewish to find out about antisemitism.  The concept is a good one, but there are many serious flaws to this film.  First there is Dorothy McGuire completely miscast as Green's fiancee Kathy.  And the idea of confronting relatively subtle antisemitism with no mention whatsoever of the Holocaust which ended just two years before the book and film is like ignoring the six million pound gorilla in the room.  But that's not unique to this film; the Holocaust was a taboo subject in film until relatively recently.The story is an interesting one, but much of it is filled in with preachy dialogue which is overacted and hurts believability.  Especially some of the speeches given by the characters, such as when Green tells Ms. Wales (June Havoc), ""Feel my hand, it's the same hand, the only thing different is the word 'Christian'"".  Seems a heavy-handed overreaction to say the least.  And an inconsistency here is that Ms. Wales is at first an ally with Green as she tells him about the antisemitic policies of the magazine they work for, but then in the next scene she becomes the antisemite (though she is Jewish).  Also the fact that she did the same thing he did (sent out two resumes, one Jewish and one not) seems more contrivance than coincidence.John Garfield is great as always as Green's Jewish army buddy.  But there is a scene with he and Kathy where he tells her  to ""hit back"" at antisemites.  Discounting McGuire's mediocre performance (""Can I? Can I?"") the answer of hitting back is acceptable, but the film treats it as a profound truth.Peck and Garfield are both great actors, so the flaws aren't a reflection on them.  The film seems to begin on a first rate level, but goes downhill in dialogue quality.  I like how Green tells the staff, ""I'd feel the same way about this even if I wasn't Jewish myself"", and the Jewish guy's reaction, ""just let us handle it in our own way"".  Green's son Tommy is played by Dean Stockwell who was later excellent in ""Long Day's Journey into Night"".  One flaw here is when Green tries to explain to Tommy what antisemitism is.  He ends up defining Jewishness in the religious sense, though that's contradicted later by Dr. Lieberman's speech, ""since many Jews are not religious there is only such a thing as a Jewish TYPE"".  I tend to agree with Lieberman (no relation to the rightwing Senator thankfully) on that.Green's mother is played by the great Anne Revere, who was blacklisted under McCarthy (ironically she's a direct descendant of Paul Revere).  The final speech she gives is overly intense and rambling, ""suddenly I want to live to be very old...it's not the Russian century or the American century...it's got to be soon""...I don't know, it doesn't work for me.Garfield was also blacklisted and some still don't forgive Kazan for cooperating with McCarthy.  Anyway in spite of all this the film is worth seeing as a rare 1940s take on antisemitism.",3,Made good by Peck & Garfield in spite of many serious flaws,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,3030,"['Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'film', '1947', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'writer', 'Green', 'who', 'be', 'Jewish', 'find', 'out', 'antisemitism', 'concept', 'good', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'serious', 'flaws', 'film', 'First', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'completely', 'miscast', 'Green', 'fiancee', 'Kathy', 'idea', 'confronting', 'relatively', 'subtle', 'antisemitism', 'mention', 'whatsoever', 'Holocaust', 'ended', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'book', 'film', 'ignoring', 'six', 'million', 'pound', 'gorilla', 'room', 'not', 'unique', 'film', 'Holocaust', 'was', 'taboo', 'subject', 'film', 'relatively', 'recently.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'one', 'much', 'filled', 'preachy', 'dialogue', 'overacted', 'believability', 'Especially', 'speeches', 'given', 'characters', 'such', 'when', 'Green', 'Ms.', 'Wales', 'June', 'Havoc', 'Feel', 'hand', 'same', 'hand', 'only', 'thing', 'different', 'word', 'heavy-handed', 'overreaction', 'say', 'least', 'inconsistency', 'here', 'Ms.', 'Wales', 'first', 'ally', 'Green', 'antisemitic', 'policies', 'magazine', 'work', 'then', 'next', 'scene', 'antisemite', 'Jewish', 'Also', 'fact', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'did', 'sent', 'out', 'two', 'resumes', 'one', 'Jewish', 'one', 'not', 'more', 'contrivance', 'coincidence.John', 'Garfield', 'great', 'as', 'always', 'Green', 'Jewish', 'army', 'buddy', 'scene', 'Kathy', 'where', 'hit', 'back', 'antisemites', 'Discounting', 'McGuire', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'Can', 'Can', 'answer', 'hitting', 'back', 'acceptable', 'film', 'profound', 'truth.Peck', 'Garfield', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'flaws', 'are', ""n't"", 'reflection', 'film', 'begin', 'first', 'rate', 'level', 'downhill', 'dialogue', 'quality', 'how', 'Green', 'staff', ""'d"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'Jewish', 'Jewish', 'guy', 'reaction', 'just', 'let', 'handle', 'own', 'way', 'Green', 'son', 'Tommy', 'played', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'excellent', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey', 'Night', 'One', 'flaw', 'here', 'when', 'Green', 'tries', 'explain', 'Tommy', 'what', 'antisemitism', 'up', 'defining', 'Jewishness', 'religious', 'sense', 'contradicted', 'later', 'Dr.', 'Lieberman', 'speech', 'many', 'Jews', 'are', 'not', 'religious', 'only', 'such', 'thing', 'Jewish', 'TYPE', 'tend', 'agree', 'Lieberman', 'relation', 'rightwing', 'Senator', 'thankfully', 'that.Green', 'mother', 'played', 'great', 'Anne', 'Revere', 'who', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'McCarthy', 'ironically', 'direct', 'descendant', 'Paul', 'Revere', 'final', 'speech', 'overly', 'intense', 'rambling', 'suddenly', 'want', 'live', 'be', 'very', 'old', 'not', 'Russian', 'century', 'American', 'century', 'got', 'be', 'soon', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.Garfield', 'was', 'also', 'blacklisted', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'Kazan', 'cooperating', 'McCarthy', 'Anyway', 'spite', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'rare', '1940s', 'take', 'antisemitism']",N/A
324321,A3PFMOTIGZN4VF,6302640512,AD,"[4, 7]","I give this 20th Century Fox DVD issue of Gentleman's Agreement 2 stars. One star is for the DVD quality, which I found excellent -- a clean, sharp black and white high quality print with good sound. The second star is for Celeste Holm's performance, which is the standout performance of the movie.The plot has been described in great detail in other reviews, so I will not repeat it. What I want to do here is to warn people not to purchase this movie until they have seen it.  Gentleman's Agreement tackles the social issue of anti-Semitism, which is a noble undertaking, but it bites off more than it can chew.  I have seen all but a few of Gregory Peck's films, and this is his weakest performance ever. In fact, Gregory Peck was one of the all-time great actors, and I have never seen him give anything other than a first-rate performance until I watched Gentleman's Agreement. In this movie he seems very uncomfortable with his character, and his performance is forced and wooden.  His character is supposed to be engaged in the noble fight against anti-Semitism, yet he makes his character unlikable.  Peck plays his character as preachy, self-righteous and self-serving, even pompous at times. It's difficult for the viewer to develop a sympathy with the character.  Early in the movie Peck's character starts to become as ponderous as the anti-semitic characters, which I doubt was the intention of the director. It doesn't help that the plot and dialogue handle the subject in an awkward manner, devoid of anything clever and intelligent. Celeste Holm is the exception.  Always a great actress, her performance here is first-rate, and she makes her character interesting, honest, sympathetic and likable.  John Garfield's performance is good, but not on a par with his best, and again, I think that has to do with the stiff and predictable plot and script. Dean Stockwell does a very competent job at playing Peck's son. Dorothy McGuire's performance as Peck's love interest has been harshly criticized by many other reviewers.  I'm not sure it was a weak performance.  I think she may be playing the character exactly as the director intended.  It's just that her character is not very likable.  And the fact that her unlikable character is Peck's love interest instead of Celeste Holm's lovable character may be a weakness in the script that ultimately pulls down the movie and damages its believability.Another problem with Gentleman's Agreement is that it drags.  It is boring and ponderous. Even Celeste Holm's great performance does not add enough spark and sparkle to this drab film to save it from being a snoozer. About 1/3 into the film you start to wish they would just get on with it and get to the end.  Too many points are repeatedly rehashed and beaten into the ground long after the viewer has gotten them.There also appears to me to be an additional problem: The movie seems to exaggerate the degree of anti-Semitism in order to play on the viewers emotions, thereby reducing much of the movie to melodrama. Granted, the movie was made in 1947 and I was not born until 1949, so I may have missed the intensity of the problem at the time the movie was made.  But growing up shortly after that period in the 1950's I did not witness such rampant anti-semitism in practice.  I lived in a suburban community and had Jewish neighbors. I swam at a swimming club with jewish friends. I went to school with Jewish kids. My father worked with Jews.  Yes, I am non-Jewish, and surely I would have felt it more directly if I were Jewish. But the fact that I was not able to observe any descrimination that was as obvious and rampant as that depicted in the movie leads me to believe that the movie overplays its hand. The movie implies that Jews were routinely denied jobs and housing, and were routinely refused service in hotels and restaurants merely because they had a Jewish name or looked Jewish. The movie appears to exaggerate the problem, even for 1947.I want to be fair to this movie. Therefore, I encourage people to view it and decide for themselves.  My criticism here is merely intended to serve as a helpful warning to those who are thinking of purchasing a copy sight-unseen. I made that mistake and am now sorry.  It's a worthwhile movie for one-time viewing, but not good enough to keep in my permanent video library. So my recommendation is to find an inexpensive way to view it before you decide to purchase it. I hope this review is helpful to the perspective buyer.",2,Gentleman's Agreement: A Noble But Failed Attempt at Social Commentary,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,4503,"['give', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'DVD', 'issue', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', '2', 'stars', 'One', 'star', 'DVD', 'quality', 'found', 'excellent', 'clean', 'sharp', 'black', 'white', 'high', 'quality', 'print', 'good', 'sound', 'second', 'star', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'performance', 'standout', 'performance', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'been', 'described', 'great', 'detail', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'What', 'want', 'do', 'here', 'warn', 'people', 'not', 'purchase', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'social', 'issue', 'anti-Semitism', 'noble', 'undertaking', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'films', 'weakest', 'performance', 'ever', 'fact', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'actors', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'give', 'anything', 'other', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'watched', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'movie', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'character', 'performance', 'forced', 'wooden', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'engaged', 'noble', 'fight', 'anti-Semitism', 'character', 'unlikable', 'Peck', 'character', 'preachy', 'self-righteous', 'self-serving', 'even', 'pompous', 'times', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'develop', 'sympathy', 'character', 'Early', 'movie', 'Peck', 'character', 'become', 'as', 'ponderous', 'anti-semitic', 'characters', 'doubt', 'was', 'intention', 'director', ""n't"", 'help', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'handle', 'subject', 'awkward', 'manner', 'devoid', 'anything', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'exception', 'great', 'actress', 'performance', 'here', 'first-rate', 'character', 'interesting', 'honest', 'sympathetic', 'likable', 'John', 'Garfield', 'performance', 'good', 'not', 'par', 'best', 'again', 'think', 'do', 'stiff', 'predictable', 'plot', 'script', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'very', 'competent', 'job', 'playing', 'Peck', 'son', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'performance', 'Peck', 'love', 'interest', 'been', 'harshly', 'criticized', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'weak', 'performance', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'playing', 'character', 'exactly', 'director', 'intended', 'just', 'character', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'fact', 'unlikable', 'character', 'Peck', 'love', 'interest', 'instead', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'lovable', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'weakness', 'script', 'ultimately', 'down', 'movie', 'damages', 'believability.Another', 'problem', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'boring', 'ponderous', 'Even', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'great', 'performance', 'not', 'add', 'enough', 'spark', 'sparkle', 'drab', 'film', 'save', 'being', 'snoozer', '1/3', 'film', 'start', 'wish', 'would', 'just', 'get', 'get', 'end', 'Too', 'many', 'points', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'rehashed', 'beaten', 'ground', 'long', 'viewer', 'gotten', 'them.There', 'also', 'be', 'additional', 'problem', 'movie', 'exaggerate', 'degree', 'anti-Semitism', 'order', 'play', 'viewers', 'emotions', 'thereby', 'reducing', 'much', 'movie', 'melodrama', 'Granted', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1947', 'was', 'not', 'born', '1949', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'intensity', 'problem', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'growing', 'up', 'shortly', 'period', '1950', 'did', 'not', 'witness', 'such', 'rampant', 'anti-semitism', 'practice', 'lived', 'suburban', 'community', 'had', 'Jewish', 'neighbors', 'swam', 'swimming', 'club', 'jewish', 'friends', 'went', 'school', 'Jewish', 'kids', 'father', 'worked', 'Jews', 'Yes', 'am', 'non-Jewish', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'more', 'directly', 'were', 'Jewish', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'observe', 'descrimination', 'was', 'obvious', 'rampant', 'depicted', 'movie', 'believe', 'movie', 'hand', 'movie', 'Jews', 'were', 'routinely', 'denied', 'jobs', 'housing', 'were', 'routinely', 'refused', 'service', 'hotels', 'restaurants', 'merely', 'had', 'Jewish', 'name', 'looked', 'Jewish', 'movie', 'exaggerate', 'problem', 'even', '1947.I', 'want', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'Therefore', 'encourage', 'people', 'view', 'decide', 'criticism', 'here', 'merely', 'intended', 'serve', 'helpful', 'warning', 'who', 'are', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'copy', 'sight-unseen', 'made', 'mistake', 'am', 'now', 'sorry', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'one-time', 'viewing', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'permanent', 'video', 'library', 'recommendation', 'find', 'inexpensive', 'way', 'view', 'decide', 'purchase', 'hope', 'review', 'helpful', 'perspective', 'buyer']",N/A
324322,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6302640512,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 2]","Do you, as do I, have to fight an urge to run for cover when the term ""message movie"" crops up?  Not to worry, because in this case GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT (1947) is a fine movie with a great cast, excellent pacing, and just enough wit and verve to highlight its headon treatment of post-World War Two anti-semitism.Gregory Peck plays Philip Green, writer for a NEWSWEEK-type weekly magazine, who sells himself on the subject of anti-semitism and goes semi-underground as ""Philip Greenberg,"" a Jewish American who is determined to negotiate his life and get to all the good stuff (club memberships, social life, personal acceptance) that the then-WASP aristocracy controlled with varying degrees of denial and arrogance.Phil finds himself not only making waves trying to do some of the things he could effortlessly have done the week before (check into a ritzy resort, for one example), but his fictional life spills over into his personal life almost before he realizes it.  His son is ostracized at school and called a ""Dirty Jew""; his girlfriend (beguilingly portrayed by Dorothy McGuire), while originally supportive, backs down and asks Phil to drop the Jewish moniker.Along the way other veins of anti-semitism are mined.  These include Phil's own secretary, a self-loathing type who changed her name from ""Walinsky"" to ""Wales,"" knowing that ""Wales"" was the only way to get a job at the supposedly-liberal magazine.  Also, a coterie of Manhattan-based Jewish businessmen get wind of what the magazine is researching, go to Phil's boss the editor, and ask him kindly to drop the subject and let them handle it ""their way.""  According to the Internet Movie Data Base, this scene had a real-life origin:  Early in the film's production, Twentieth Century-Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck (a German-American Christian) was confronted by a number of Jewish studio heads who asked him please not to make a movie on the subject of anti-semitism.Peck's quiet integrity as an actor goes a long way toward selling this show, even in places where it might get a little preachy.  He is surrounded by a marvelous supporting cast, including not only Dorothy McGuire but Jane Wyatt, Celeste Holm, young Dean Stockwell as his school-age son, and John Garfield (born Julius Garfinckel), Phil's Army buddy who offered the insight that anti-semitism is everywhere, whether conscious, personal and cruel, or aloof, unacknowledged and institutional.GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT is by all measure a good solid film that can be viewed with profit even today.  While watching it, I was reminded of later attempts by other groups (including, but not limited to African-Americans, Feminists, gay people and Hispanics) to make the case that they, too, had been excluded from the American dream due to stereotypes, prejudices, and the failure of good people to come to their aid.

324325,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6302640512,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is one of the most important movies made in the 20th century. Gregory Peck plays a magazine writer who is given an assignment to do a series on anti-Semitism. Dorothy McGuire plays the editor's niece who originally suggested the series. She really does believe she is not herself an anti-Semite.As the frustration grows that Peck can't seem to get a handle on the story, he talks to his mother about the other stories he has done. When he wanted to write about migrant workers, he bought an old run-down truck and crossed the country on Route 66, being one of them. When he did a series on coal miners, he took a job in a mine and got his hands dirty. Suddenly he realizes that since he's new in town, nobody knows that he's not Jewish except the editor and his niece. So he decides he's going to tell people he is Jewish and see what happens.The first challenge is the secretary assigned to him. She's blond and doesn't look a bit Jewish, but she is. She changed her name. She tells the story of having sent out two applications for a job, one with her original name, one with her new Anglo-Saxon one. The Jewish girl got told the job was filled and the Anglo got hired. And this was right here on the magazine they were working for at the time. So Peck tells his editor about this, and the editor calls the personnel director on the carpet about it, and dictates an ad for a model of what they are going to do from now on, ending the ad with ""Religion is a matter of no consequence to this firm.""And so it goes. He finds himself treated as a second-class citizen, his kid is yelled at by the other kids, and so on. But what really gets him is more difficult. He is falling in love with the editor's niece, and she with him. But she doesn't think she's anti-semitic, remember? So when her sister in Connecticut invites the couple up for a party to celebrate their engagement, she tells her sister about the deception, that he's not really Jewish, and at Peck's request, asks her not to let any of the people at the party know. So the sister only invites the ""safe"" people, leaving out the ones she knows are bigots.And the hotel they had reservations for their honeymoon turns out to be restricted. There's a pitiful scene where the manager tries to find out whether Peck is Jewish or not without ever actually saying the word, in order to answer his question as to whether or not the hotel is restricted. In other words, if he's Christian, they'll tell him it is restricted, and presumably he'll be glad. If he's Jewish, they are not restricted, but ""they are full up and have no rooms available,"" but they'd be happy to make reservations for him at another hotel down the road.Young people may not believe just how nasty it was, or say what's this compared to prejudice against blacks? True; but the problem is a Jew is not necessarily known by the way he looks, whereas a black person is. So people could pretend to be liberal and awfully nice, but harbor the secondary prejudice of accepting other people's anti-semitism without fighting back. And in that aspect, the movie makes a point which applies equally to all sorts of prejudice.McGuire meets Peck's Jewish friend and tells him about a man at lunch who was telling crude anti-semitic jokes. The rest of the people didn't laugh, and they felt bad about it, but they didn't challenge the guy. They just sat there and kept silent about it. And that, my friends, often happens about other kinds of prejudice. Don't want to rent to ""them""? Why it's not prejudice, it's just that they wouldn't be happy here, with so many bigots in the area. Tacky jokes, hateful comments? No, you don't tell them, but you also don't argue with the guy who does. You may even laugh a little, and then be ashamed of finding it funny.Who was it said that all it takes for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing? This movie did, for one. It gets four stars only because some of the scenes seem a bit contrived. But the movie is an important one, one of the most important of the 20th century.",4,"Good Drama, Good Social Commentary",1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,4043,"['one', 'most', 'important', 'movies', 'made', '20th', 'century', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'magazine', 'writer', 'who', 'given', 'assignment', 'do', 'series', 'anti-Semitism', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'editor', 'niece', 'who', 'originally', 'suggested', 'series', 'really', 'believe', 'not', 'anti-Semite.As', 'frustration', 'Peck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'handle', 'story', 'mother', 'other', 'stories', 'done', 'When', 'wanted', 'write', 'migrant', 'workers', 'bought', 'old', 'run-down', 'truck', 'crossed', 'country', 'Route', '66', 'being', 'one', 'When', 'did', 'series', 'coal', 'miners', 'took', 'job', 'mine', 'got', 'hands', 'dirty', 'Suddenly', 'new', 'town', 'nobody', 'not', 'Jewish', 'editor', 'niece', 'going', 'tell', 'people', 'Jewish', 'see', 'what', 'happens.The', 'first', 'challenge', 'secretary', 'assigned', 'blond', ""n't"", 'look', 'bit', 'Jewish', 'changed', 'name', 'story', 'having', 'sent', 'out', 'two', 'applications', 'job', 'one', 'original', 'name', 'one', 'new', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'one', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'got', 'told', 'job', 'was', 'filled', 'Anglo', 'got', 'hired', 'was', 'right', 'here', 'magazine', 'were', 'working', 'time', 'So', 'Peck', 'editor', 'editor', 'personnel', 'director', 'carpet', 'ad', 'model', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'now', 'ending', 'ad', 'Religion', 'matter', 'consequence', 'firm', 'so', 'treated', 'second-class', 'citizen', 'kid', 'yelled', 'other', 'kids', 'so', 'what', 'really', 'more', 'difficult', 'falling', 'love', 'editor', 'niece', ""n't"", 'think', 'anti-semitic', 'remember', 'So', 'when', 'sister', 'Connecticut', 'couple', 'up', 'party', 'celebrate', 'engagement', 'sister', 'deception', 'not', 'really', 'Jewish', 'Peck', 'request', 'not', 'let', 'people', 'party', 'know', 'sister', 'only', 'safe', 'people', 'leaving', 'out', 'ones', 'are', 'hotel', 'had', 'reservations', 'honeymoon', 'out', 'be', 'restricted', 'pitiful', 'scene', 'where', 'manager', 'find', 'out', 'Peck', 'Jewish', 'not', 'ever', 'actually', 'saying', 'word', 'order', 'answer', 'question', 'not', 'hotel', 'restricted', 'other', 'words', 'Christian', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'restricted', 'presumably', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'Jewish', 'are', 'not', 'restricted', 'are', 'full', 'up', 'have', 'rooms', 'available', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'make', 'reservations', 'hotel', 'down', 'road.Young', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'believe', 'just', 'how', 'nasty', 'was', 'say', 'what', 'compared', 'prejudice', 'blacks', 'True', 'problem', 'Jew', 'not', 'necessarily', 'known', 'way', 'black', 'person', 'So', 'people', 'could', 'pretend', 'be', 'liberal', 'awfully', 'nice', 'harbor', 'secondary', 'prejudice', 'accepting', 'other', 'people', 'anti-semitism', 'fighting', 'back', 'aspect', 'movie', 'point', 'equally', 'sorts', 'prejudice.McGuire', 'meets', 'Peck', 'Jewish', 'friend', 'man', 'lunch', 'who', 'was', 'telling', 'crude', 'anti-semitic', 'jokes', 'rest', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'felt', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'guy', 'just', 'sat', 'kept', 'silent', 'friends', 'often', 'other', 'kinds', 'prejudice', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'rent', 'Why', 'not', 'prejudice', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'here', 'so', 'many', 'bigots', 'area', 'Tacky', 'jokes', 'hateful', 'comments', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'argue', 'guy', 'who', 'may', 'even', 'laugh', 'little', 'then', 'be', 'ashamed', 'finding', 'funny.Who', 'was', 'said', 'evil', 'triumph', 'good', 'people', 'do', 'nothing', 'movie', 'did', 'one', 'four', 'stars', 'only', 'scenes', 'seem', 'bit', 'contrived', 'movie', 'important', 'one', 'one', 'most', 'important', '20th', 'century']",N/A

324327,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6302640512,Char,"[0, 0]","Very interesting fact: This movie came out in 1947, just as the modern nation of Israel was being established.A journalist does a feature story about anti-semitism from the point of view of a Jew.  In order to experience what being Jewish is really like, he purports to be a Jew himself.Although I was disappointed and bored with the movie at first while it went through the process of laying the groundwork for the story, and I could not imagine early in the film how the movie could have gotten three important academy awards, I thought by the end of the movie that it was worthy-of-note.  It did manage finally to effectively drive home an IMPORTANT MESSAGE relating to the greatness of America as a country founded upon the protection of certain freedoms and inalienable rights. And about religious and/or racial prejudice. And most of all about a heartfelt HOPE for all people being able to live together in freedom.There is still a LOT of anger and hatred in our world that is motivated by a great variety of religious/racial prejudices.  Not least is the age-old conflict between Protestants and Catholics, and between Christians and Jews, and now there is a new conflict in America between aetheists and believers in God.  There is a new battle in America for Freedom of Conscience regarding a person's individual or group religious convictions regarding moral issues.  So this is still a very timely story, this ""Gentleman's Agreement"" which is about a maddening kind of thing that I suppose might be called a subtle ""hypocrisy"" that occurs at both a personal and a group level, and that gangs up on the hated other group.Anybody who is in a stew about the clashes currently surrounding claims to freedoms that threaten other groups' claims to freedoms would probably find this movie not only compelling, but also edifying.  It COULD change some viewers' lives, although there are many people who are already energized by the same kind of Whammo Inspiration that Dave delivers as a freeing, turning-point conclusion.  (Dave is a very likable Jewish friend of the journalist, Phil.)I gotta say that ""Phil Green"" must have been actually part-Jewish (within the story) because from the first, his ""Mom"" in the story seemed to me to resemble a frankly plain-spoken, New-Yorker-Jewish type of personality!  (Please don't label me as a reprehensible racial ""stereotyper"" for thinking that there are such ""typical"" personalities!)  The mother in the story was one of my favorite characters, and when she found HOPE at the end.One big flaw in the movie is that it mixes together and confuses religious identity and racial identity.  One scene, a conversation with a Jewish professor, seems to be an attempt to separate out these two kinds of identity, but the movie proceeds on with simplistic statements which continue to make a confusing mix of religion and race.  For instance, one remark seems to present a definition of being Jewish as someone who practices the Hebrew religion; but the movie shows that the prejudice against Jews is directed at a racial blood-heritage and not only just toward people who practice the Jewish religion.  The movie sets up the conflict as being mainly religious, as being something like a prejudicial conflict (a specifically American conflict) between WASPs, Catholics, and Jews.  So, this confused mix is probably the biggest problem with the films' basic conceptual premise.As the story deepens, the film is also important as a dramatization of a conflict between two individuals who are in love and who think that they are just right for one another but who, perhaps, on the other hand, are not.Overall, a meaningful drama, mostly [I thought] fairly well acted, with an important message for all conscientious persons of our time.Celeste Holm was the only actor in this who got an Academy Award, and I think she deserved it well enough.  She seemed to be carefully photographed to advantage in some scenes, and less so in others, which was a deliberate manipulation of the viewers feelings toward her.  I wouldn't be able to agree, though, with viewers who saw her aggressive and ""catty"" personality as wonderfully attractive.  But didn't think the lead actress was either.  Especially her hair style detracted somehow from the attractiveness she should have had for her role as the preferred romantic partner.  Part of the plot was her growth from a weak-to-morally-strong person, so it was necessary that she be portrayed throughout most of the movie as an unattractive waverer up until the turning point at the end.",4,Toward an end of Prejudice and Hatred (especially re race and religion),1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,4560,"['Very', 'interesting', 'fact', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1947', 'just', 'modern', 'nation', 'Israel', 'was', 'being', 'established.A', 'journalist', 'feature', 'story', 'anti-semitism', 'point', 'view', 'Jew', 'order', 'experience', 'what', 'being', 'Jewish', 'really', 'like', 'be', 'Jew', 'himself.Although', 'was', 'disappointed', 'bored', 'movie', 'first', 'went', 'process', 'laying', 'groundwork', 'story', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'early', 'film', 'how', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'three', 'important', 'academy', 'awards', 'thought', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'worthy-of-note', 'did', 'manage', 'finally', 'effectively', 'drive', 'home', 'IMPORTANT', 'MESSAGE', 'relating', 'greatness', 'America', 'country', 'founded', 'protection', 'certain', 'freedoms', 'inalienable', 'rights', 'religious', 'and/or', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'most', 'heartfelt', 'HOPE', 'people', 'being', 'able', 'live', 'together', 'freedom.There', 'still', 'LOT', 'anger', 'hatred', 'world', 'motivated', 'great', 'variety', 'religious/racial', 'prejudices', 'Not', 'least', 'age-old', 'conflict', 'Protestants', 'Catholics', 'Christians', 'Jews', 'now', 'new', 'conflict', 'America', 'aetheists', 'believers', 'God', 'new', 'battle', 'America', 'Freedom', 'Conscience', 'regarding', 'person', 'individual', 'group', 'religious', 'convictions', 'regarding', 'moral', 'issues', 'still', 'very', 'timely', 'story', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'maddening', 'kind', 'thing', 'suppose', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'subtle', 'hypocrisy', 'personal', 'group', 'level', 'up', 'hated', 'other', 'group.Anybody', 'who', 'stew', 'clashes', 'currently', 'surrounding', 'claims', 'freedoms', 'threaten', 'other', 'groups', 'claims', 'freedoms', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'compelling', 'also', 'edifying', 'COULD', 'change', 'viewers', 'lives', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'energized', 'same', 'kind', 'Whammo', 'Inspiration', 'Dave', 'delivers', 'freeing', 'turning-point', 'conclusion', 'Dave', 'very', 'likable', 'Jewish', 'friend', 'journalist', 'Phil', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'Phil', 'Green', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'actually', 'part-Jewish', 'story', 'first', 'Mom', 'story', 'seemed', 'resemble', 'frankly', 'plain-spoken', 'New-Yorker-Jewish', 'type', 'personality', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'label', 'reprehensible', 'racial', 'stereotyper', 'thinking', 'are', 'such', 'typical', 'personalities', 'mother', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'when', 'found', 'HOPE', 'end.One', 'big', 'flaw', 'movie', 'together', 'religious', 'identity', 'racial', 'identity', 'One', 'scene', 'conversation', 'Jewish', 'professor', 'be', 'attempt', 'separate', 'out', 'two', 'kinds', 'identity', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'simplistic', 'statements', 'continue', 'make', 'confusing', 'mix', 'religion', 'race', 'instance', 'one', 'remark', 'present', 'definition', 'being', 'Jewish', 'someone', 'who', 'practices', 'Hebrew', 'religion', 'movie', 'prejudice', 'Jews', 'directed', 'racial', 'blood-heritage', 'not', 'only', 'just', 'people', 'who', 'practice', 'Jewish', 'religion', 'movie', 'up', 'conflict', 'being', 'mainly', 'religious', 'being', 'something', 'prejudicial', 'conflict', 'specifically', 'American', 'conflict', 'WASPs', 'Catholics', 'Jews', 'So', 'confused', 'mix', 'probably', 'biggest', 'problem', 'films', 'basic', 'conceptual', 'premise.As', 'story', 'deepens', 'film', 'also', 'important', 'dramatization', 'conflict', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'love', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'just', 'right', 'one', 'who', 'perhaps', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'not.Overall', 'meaningful', 'drama', 'mostly', 'thought', ']', 'fairly', 'well', 'acted', 'important', 'message', 'conscientious', 'persons', 'time.Celeste', 'Holm', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'got', 'Academy', 'Award', 'think', 'deserved', 'well', 'enough', 'seemed', 'be', 'carefully', 'photographed', 'advantage', 'scenes', 'less', 'so', 'others', 'was', 'deliberate', 'manipulation', 'viewers', 'feelings', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'agree', 'viewers', 'who', 'saw', 'aggressive', 'catty', 'personality', 'wonderfully', 'attractive', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'lead', 'actress', 'was', 'either', 'Especially', 'hair', 'style', 'detracted', 'somehow', 'attractiveness', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'role', 'preferred', 'romantic', 'partner', 'Part', 'plot', 'was', 'growth', 'weak-to-morally-strong', 'person', 'was', 'necessary', 'be', 'portrayed', 'most', 'movie', 'unattractive', 'waverer', 'up', 'turning', 'point', 'end']",N/A

And yes, this now firmly Democratic Party stronghold once was solidly in the GOP column.  Far too many Republicans were anti-Semitic bigots and did everything possible to discriminate against Jews.  Journalist Phillip Green (Gregory Peck) pretends to be Jewish so that he can find out about the reality of these exclusionary practices.  He finds out quickly that the discrimination is much worse than could have earlier imagined.  No, the establishment elites did not wear Nazi uniforms and swear allegiance to Adolph Hitler.  Their prejudicial behavior was subtle and nonviolent.  The goal was to turn Jewish-Americans into second class citizens.  Regrettably, we have not overcome the resulting anger and bitterness of this era.  Many Jewish voters still hesitate to vote Republican even when this might arguably be their logical choice.I strongly urge all teachers to require their students to view this film.

The film itself is deserving of all of the accolades it received, both upon its initial release, and in all the years since.I'm assuming that most of the people considering a purchase of the DVD have already seen the movie, so I'd like to focus here on the incisive commentary by Richard Schickel, long-time film critic for Time magazine. Stars June Havoc and Celeste Holm are also heard on the track, recorded separately, and while their remarks are interesting, this is Schickel's showcase, and he runs with it.As it happened, I wound up listening to this commentary over the course of three nights. This kind of gradual exposure allowed me to really absorb Schickel's observations.The critic is no sycophantic fan of &quot;Gentleman's Agreement.&quot; While he admires its aims, and much of its execution (primarily the achievements of director Elia Kazan), he has some reservations about the script, and some of the acting.He demonstrates a complete understanding of the conventions of 1940s studio filmmaking, but doesn't always accept the necessity that &quot;Gentleman's Agreement&quot; had to adhere to those norms. I didn't always agree with Schickel's criticisms of the film, but they certainly made me think, and I never found them off-putting.Schickel wisely underscores the contribution of John Garfield, whose training in The Group Theater gave him a more realistic acting style than anyone else in the film. &quot;Garfield seems to be acting in an entirely different movie,&quot; Schickel says, and it is not a criticism. The Garfield performance leads on a direct path to Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire,&quot; also directed by Kazan, and Schickel makes this clear. It is at this point that he makes the single most fascinating statement in the entire commentary, which I won't spoil for you here. Suffice it to say that it's something that may strike you as intuitive, but put into this context, becomes something of a revelation.I've seen Web-based reviews of this DVD that criticize Schickel for doing too much plot summary. I disagree; he doesn't merely give a blow-by-blow account of what's hapening. He mentions plot points, but goes on to offer an opinion about how well the moment is conveyed, or about what real-life parallels the film is touching upon, or something else that is valuable to the viewer.DVD commentaries just don't get much better than this.The other extras on the disc, among them an AMC backstory presentation and a selection of 1947 newsreels, are nice additions.",5,Superb DVD presentation of classic film,1081382400,"04 8, 2004",2004,2695,"['Kudos', 'Fox', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'very', 'satisfying', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'quot', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'quot', '1947', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'film', 'deserving', 'accolades', 'received', 'initial', 'release', 'years', 'since.I', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'most', 'people', 'considering', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', 'focus', 'here', 'incisive', 'commentary', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'long-time', 'film', 'critic', 'Time', 'magazine', 'Stars', 'June', 'Havoc', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'are', 'also', 'heard', 'track', 'recorded', 'separately', 'remarks', 'are', 'interesting', 'Schickel', 'showcase', 'it.As', 'happened', 'wound', 'up', 'listening', 'commentary', 'course', 'three', 'nights', 'kind', 'gradual', 'exposure', 'allowed', 'really', 'absorb', 'Schickel', 'observations.The', 'critic', 'sycophantic', 'fan', 'quot', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement.', 'quot', 'aims', 'much', 'execution', 'primarily', 'achievements', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'reservations', 'script', 'acting.He', 'complete', 'understanding', 'conventions', '1940s', 'studio', 'filmmaking', ""n't"", 'always', 'accept', 'necessity', 'quot', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'quot', 'had', 'adhere', 'norms', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'agree', 'Schickel', 'criticisms', 'film', 'certainly', 'made', 'think', 'never', 'found', 'off-putting.Schickel', 'wisely', 'contribution', 'John', 'Garfield', 'training', 'Group', 'Theater', 'gave', 'more', 'realistic', 'acting', 'style', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'quot', 'Garfield', 'be', 'acting', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie', 'quot', 'Schickel', 'not', 'criticism', 'Garfield', 'performance', 'direct', 'path', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Stanley', 'Kowalski', 'quot', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'quot', 'also', 'directed', 'Kazan', 'Schickel', 'clear', 'point', 'single', 'most', 'fascinating', 'statement', 'entire', 'commentary', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'something', 'may', 'strike', 'intuitive', 'put', 'context', 'something', 'revelation.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Web-based', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'criticize', 'Schickel', 'doing', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'summary', 'disagree', ""n't"", 'merely', 'give', 'blow-by-blow', 'account', 'what', 'hapening', 'plot', 'points', 'offer', 'opinion', 'how', 'well', 'moment', 'conveyed', 'what', 'real-life', 'film', 'touching', 'something', 'else', 'valuable', 'viewer.DVD', 'commentaries', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'this.The', 'other', 'extras', 'disc', 'AMC', 'backstory', 'presentation', 'selection', '1947', 'newsreels', 'are', 'nice', 'additions']",N/A

The credits and the hype preview a really moving experience but the range of reviews tell a different story. This is a film which was famous on its release for its daring but the accolades tended to cloud what was actually up on the screen. It has not stood the test of time well and here are some reasons:- Gregory Peck, for many a perfect FILM actor if only for his leading man looks, was often very dull. In this film, he is wooden beyond belief. A perfect world would have cast Spencer Tracy in the role.- the film is really a series of conversations between Peck and the other characters. Since Peck barely connects with any of the other actors, it becomes a very tedious conversation indeed.- the film also is a quite detailed romance between Peck and leading lady Dorothy McGuire. Her role is pivotal to the exposition of middle class prejudice but it is hard to care for this artificial couple so it deflates the effect.- the director Elia Kazan was from the stage and not really experienced in film and it shows. The film simply does not ""move"". The direction of McGuire and Peck constantly reminded me of Edmund Goulding's direction of Gene Tierney and Tyrone Power in ""The Razor's Edge""; move 3 steps to the right, turn, deliver line etc etc- the performances are extremely variable with John Garfield probably the best. His realistic style stands out in bas relief to Peck.- Celeste Holm won an Oscar and she is very entertaining but then she does have the best dialogue.- the script manages to touch on many issues which is admirable but all the highlights are when the prejudice is actually seen, particularly that in the lobby of a hotel.- the producer, Daryl F. Zanuck, famous for his editing skills could have applied them more rigorously here. It may be that the integrity of this ambitious project blinded him to the endless talk.Issued as part of the Fox Studio Classic Series, the DVD print is surprisingly imperfect with a few vertical lines and dirt. The package contains some interesting extras. There are all the usual marketing items but the best extra is Richard Schickel's commentary. While Schickel's delivery is never dynamic, he highlights many of the film's problems, particularly with the awkward acting of the principals and the verbose script. He nails why the film is so dated while still being valid. Scattered within his commentary are additional comments from Celeste Holm and June Havoc, the latter playing Peck's secretary. Neither add much insight other than a welcome personal touch. It is amusing that Celeste Holm notes that Gregory Peck was as humourless offscreen as he was on.The DVD is available very cheaply in the Classic Quad No 7 and therefore excellent value.",3,Important but stilted,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,2834,"['famous', 'film', 'anti-semitism', 'garnered', 'many', 'comprehensive', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'first', 'impressions', 'are', 'deceiving', 'credits', 'hype', 'preview', 'really', 'moving', 'experience', 'range', 'reviews', 'tell', 'different', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'famous', 'release', 'daring', 'accolades', 'tended', 'cloud', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'up', 'screen', 'not', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'well', 'here', 'are', 'reasons', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'many', 'perfect', 'FILM', 'actor', 'only', 'leading', 'man', 'was', 'often', 'very', 'dull', 'film', 'wooden', 'belief', 'perfect', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'cast', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'role.-', 'film', 'really', 'series', 'conversations', 'Peck', 'other', 'characters', 'Peck', 'barely', 'other', 'actors', 'very', 'tedious', 'conversation', 'indeed.-', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'detailed', 'romance', 'Peck', 'leading', 'lady', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'role', 'pivotal', 'exposition', 'middle', 'class', 'prejudice', 'hard', 'care', 'artificial', 'couple', 'effect.-', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'was', 'stage', 'not', 'really', 'experienced', 'film', 'film', 'simply', 'not', 'move', 'direction', 'McGuire', 'Peck', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'Edmund', 'Goulding', 'direction', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'Razor', 'Edge', 'move', '3', 'steps', 'right', 'turn', 'deliver', 'line', 'etc-', 'performances', 'are', 'extremely', 'variable', 'John', 'Garfield', 'probably', 'best', 'realistic', 'style', 'out', 'bas', 'relief', 'Peck.-', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'won', 'Oscar', 'very', 'entertaining', 'then', 'have', 'best', 'dialogue.-', 'script', 'touch', 'many', 'issues', 'admirable', 'highlights', 'are', 'when', 'prejudice', 'actually', 'seen', 'particularly', 'lobby', 'hotel.-', 'producer', 'Daryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'famous', 'editing', 'skills', 'could', 'have', 'applied', 'more', 'rigorously', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'integrity', 'ambitious', 'project', 'blinded', 'endless', 'talk.Issued', 'part', 'Fox', 'Studio', 'Classic', 'Series', 'DVD', 'print', 'surprisingly', 'imperfect', 'few', 'vertical', 'lines', 'dirt', 'package', 'interesting', 'extras', 'are', 'usual', 'marketing', 'items', 'best', 'extra', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'commentary', 'Schickel', 'delivery', 'never', 'dynamic', 'highlights', 'many', 'film', 'problems', 'particularly', 'awkward', 'acting', 'principals', 'verbose', 'script', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'dated', 'still', 'being', 'valid', 'Scattered', 'commentary', 'are', 'additional', 'comments', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'June', 'Havoc', 'latter', 'playing', 'Peck', 'secretary', 'add', 'much', 'insight', 'other', 'welcome', 'personal', 'touch', 'amusing', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'notes', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'humourless', 'offscreen', 'was', 'on.The', 'DVD', 'available', 'very', 'cheaply', 'Classic', 'Quad', 'No', '7', 'therefore', 'excellent', 'value']",N/A

He does this because he has been assigned to write a series of articles on anti-semitism. The way ordinary people react to Green shocks him to the core and underlines the deeply rooted racism against Jews which was present at that time.  The most moving scene in the film for me is when Green is confronted by outright racism in a hotel.  Director Elia Kazan and producer Darryl F Zanuck took a great risk producing this film and they did so against a backdrop of other well know Jewish film-makers pleading with them not to make it, because they knew the furore that it would produce.

While anti-Semitism is addressed specifically in the film, one can easily apply the issues raised to all sorts of discrimination and for this reason, this film ages rather well and remains entertaining for audiences today.  I liked the fact that no overboard, irritating soundtracks or scores that were so prevalent among films of those days e.g. ""Best Years of Our Lives"" and ""The 3rd Man"" was included in this film.  It was a quiet as can be and for me, it made me enjoy the film a lot better.  I thought the acting and screenplay were quite good and although this film is not one of the great classics, it is still a good film to watch.My real beef is with the quality or should I say lack of it of this DVD version.  Although the Special Features are better than most and includes a short documentary about the making of the film, the sound quality which comes in both Stereo and Mono options are just average but the picture quality is really very poor.  The reason for this is that unlike other Fox releases such as ""The Song of Bernadette"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath"", this version has not been restored or remastered in any way.  This means this film is riddled with visual imperfections from start to finish which takes away greatly from one's overall enjoyment of an otherwise pretty good film.Here's hoping with the advent of Blu-Ray that they decide to do a proper restoration job adding sound options for at least Dolby Digital or DTS/THX 5.1 surround sound to cater to today's audiences.

I've done it, and very likely you have done it too.  But it's really okay.  We're not prejudiced, and we're not hurting any one.  It's just a little private laugh between friends.Based on the celebrated but now sadly neglected novel by Laura Z. Hobson, GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT is a story about the little jokes that people tell because they want to fit in--and the jokes that people let pass because they don't want to make a scene.  And it is about the way in which such incidents enable still darker prejudices that strike directly at the heart of all the people we make the little jokes about.Philip Schuyler Green has been employed to write an expose of anti-Semitism in post-WWII America--and he has an inspiration.  He will pretend to be Jewish himself and experience anti-Semitism first hand.  But the little jokes are soon followed by little patronizations, the patronizations give way to ill-concealed racism and religious prejudice, and what began as a magazine job begins to shake Green to his very foundations.  It will threaten his friendships, his relationship with the socialite he hopes to marry, the well-being of his mother, and ultimately the safety of his child.Critics are fond of pointing out that the film is flawed.  That is true enough: the first quarter hour feels a bit slow, leading man Gregory Pecks seems to lack conviction in his earliest scenes, and the script often calls upon its characters to philosophize in an unlikely way; the last scene in the film also rings false.  In terms of performance, the cast is stylistically divided: half perform in what might be called ""the standard Hollywood style"" of the day, half adopt an approach that we recognize as modern.  Nonetheless, these become trivial issues in the face of the powerful statement involved; everything goes down before it, and if you unexpectedly and most unpleasantly see yourself reflected in one or more characters or situations, don't feel alone.Critics are also fond of stating that changing times have left the subject dated.  Well, you tell me... when was the last time you heard one of those ""little jokes?""  True enough, it may not have been about Jews.  It might have been about African-Americans.  Or Mexicans.  Or gays.  Or was it, given today's environment, just a little joke about Moslems?  To our great shame, the overall point of GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT remains as deadly accurate today as it was more than half a century ago.The DVD has several bonuses.  Most notable are the ""Back Story"" documentary produced by AMC and the commentary led by critic Richard Schickel.  The transfer, although not excellent, is good.

De Sapio""","[11, 12]","To those who claim that GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT exaggerates the degree of antisemitism in 1940's America, I would point out that the script is an indictment not so much of blatant antisemitism (there is little of that shown), but of decent people, common to every era, who are passive, who fail to work for a more just society; and that any ethnic group could stand in for the Jewish one depicted in the film.  With those who complain that some of the acting is stilted or wooden I partly agree and would add that the style of acting prevalent in the 1940's cinema was rather at odds with the daring, realistic themes it was starting to explore (think also of 1949's gritty CALL NORTHSIDE 777).  This aside, Gregory Peck's performance as Schuyler ""Phil"" Green, a writer who poses as a Jewish man in order to expose ""everyday"" antisemitism, is extraordinary.  (This device, the personalizing of antisemitic experience for Green, itself prevents the film from becoming a mere tract.)  From a somewhat apathetic bystander he changes into an individual of strong convictions.  His speeches denouncing antisemitism or passivity are right-on, and he plays the kind of compassionate father any child would want.  When he is put out of a ""restricted"" hotel in one of the film's climactic scenes, the viewer feels he is finally and truly in the very shoes of those who experience such treatment regularly.  One who should be used to vulgar antisemitic remarks is Green's Jewish best friend, Dave Goldman.  But in that role John Garfield conveys movingly the restrained yet profound sadness of a man for whom each new antisemitic incident is as painful as the first one was.  Celeste Holm fully deserved the Oscar she won for her portrayal of Anne, Green's outspoken colleague.  As a previous reviewer said, one almost wishes Green had married her in the end rather than the morally weaker Kathy.  Yet Dorothy McGuire has her own kind of strength in this role; one believes Kathy will only become stronger in the future and thus a ""fit wife"" for Green.

While this may be somewhat dated in it's specific subject matter, the underlying theme is ongoing.Gregory Peck is terrific (as always) in his role of a morally strong writer who decides to pretend to be Jewish to get an inside scoop on the anti-Semitism that was so prevalent. Oh, he got an inside scoop for sure. It's truly amazing how many people would be nice to him and willing to help, but as soon as they found out that he was Jewish they turn the cold shoulder. That action all by itself shows the senselessness of the racism--if they didn't even know there was a difference until told, what was the point?!There was a good supporting cast in this movie as well. Dorothy McGuire was Peck's love, and she played a very real character. Sometimes the ""real characters"" were a little too real, as this by no means was a feel good story from beginning to end. The relationships got real rocky at times, and the point made by the movie was more than just to point out the ignorance of racists. The point of the movie was to show how good people, people who were not racist, helped racism along by not taking a stand and acting against it.Ultimately, Peck took a stand that was very difficult and affected his personal life, but it was worth it.

Peck plays Phil Green, a magazine writer who pretends for six months that he is Jewish so he can write a series of exposes on anti-Semitism.  The script by Moss Hart, based on Laura Z. Hobson's novel, is supposed to examine the effects of this impersonation on Green's life, specifically in terms of his fiance Kathy Lacey (Dorothy McGuire), his mother (Anne Revere), and one of his co-workers, Anne Dettrey (Celeste Holm).  But the whole thing is just so self-conscious that as much as you want to applaud the attempt, it is hard to get past the execution.

Looking for an angle for the story, he poses as a Jewish man with his son (he is recently widowed). At first, it's just about getting a more inside look for the story. It becomes very personal when both he and his son actually experience the prejudice he's writing about. Interspersed is a romance with Kathy Lacy (Dorothy McGuire), the divorced niece of the editor. While she is supportive and actually initiated the idea for the story, Philip finds there is a real difference between those who intellectually oppose prejudice and those willing to actually do something about it. When he finds out she owns a home in an area where there is a GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT not to ever sell to anyone Jewish, the romance hits the rocks and he turns into a crusader for the Jewish people. While the story may be somewhat outdated (it was actually shocking in 1947) the question to ask ourselves is where are we more like Kathy in areas of our lives that we should be outspoken about. Where can we make a difference by standing up for those who are experiencing discrimination or something less than equality? A film well worth watching and discussing.

He struggles to find an angle that hasn't been done before, then realizes the only way he can write it is to live it first.  He pretends to be Jewish and encounters some outspoken biased feelings from some, and even worse a politeness from others who smugly hide their prejudices but still restrict hom from joining others.  This sudden ""truth"" about him affects his relationship with the woman he loves...and his happy son is suddenly picked on by classmates who call him derogatory Jewish slurs.It is still a powerful piece, though dated, of course.  But prejudice still exists for people of all nationalities and religions.  We've seen enough of that in the news to know that hate never disappears.  Gregory Peck is excellent as the writer, and Dorothy McGuire turns in a good performance.  Exceptional in the cast are John Garfield as the writer's best friend (who happens to be Jewish), Anne Revere as Peck's mother, and Celeste Holm, who develops a crush on him.  Garfield is best known for his angry young man performances, but except for one brief moment of a fight in this film, he displays a touching inner dignity throughout the picture.  Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap) is excellent as Peck's son.The film was a difficult one to get made.  It was a best-selling novel, but most of the studio heads wouldn't option the screen rights because they were Jewish and they didn't want to draw attention to themselves by making this story.  Maverick producer Darryl F. Zanuck, who wasn't Jewish, was the head of the 20th Century-Fox studio at the time, bought the rights.  And after it was filmed, the other studio heads offered to buy the film from him, in order to shelve it.  He wouldn't sell out...and the film went on to win the Best Picture Oscar for 1947.Many of the people in front of the cameras and behind had to face the House Un-American Activities Committee.

Gregory Peck stars as Philip Green/Greenberg, a reporter impersonating a Jew in order to gain first hand knowledge into anti-Semitism. At first, snubs seem quite subtle and harmless. But as the film progresses the seething underbelly of dissension against the Jewish faith begins to rear its ugly head. Dorothy McGuire costars as Kathy, his waspish girlfriend who struggles with her own built-in anti-Semitism. John Garfield offers a startling and poignant cameo as Dave Goldberg, while Celeste Holm turns in another fine performance as Anne Dettrey, the only cast member seemingly untouched by prejudice. The film also costars Anne Revere, as Philip?s mother, and Dean Stockwell as his son.  Despite excellent source material from the novel by Laura Z. Hobson, and the directorial reigns handed over to one of Hollywood?s best, Eli Kazan, the resulting film is heavy-handed and tiresome in spots. The plot never quite surpasses its very theatrical staging and the performances, particularly McGuire's are stiff and uninspiring.Fox already released this title as a movie only disc, without the making-of featurette. Now, as part of its Studio Series ?Gentlemen?s Agreement? continues to suffer from digital anomalies which plagued the original transfer.

The journalist, Phil Green, is played by Gregory Peck and in order to get his information first hand, he poses as Jew.  He encounters all forms of prejudice and his blooming romance with the niece of his publisher takes a hit.  Kathy (Dorothy McGuire) insists that she harbors no ant-Semitic feelings finds that through her association with Green, that such prejudices bubble underneath the surface.  John Garfield gives a standout performance as Green's lifelong friend, Dave Goldman, who has experience prejudice his whole life and has learned to be philosophical about man's failings, but still is willing to fight against blind ignorance as noted in a gripping scene where he is denied a room in a swanky hotel by an unbearable snooty desk clerk who refuses to admit the reason he won't give Dave a room is that he is Jewish even though it is obviously apparent that is the reason why.  Celeste Holm won the Best Supporting Actress award for her role as a fashion writer and socialite who is attracted to Green and heavily pursues him.  The film was ground-breaking at the time of its release as it was the first Hollywood movie to tackle anti-Semitism head-on.  Prior to World War II, it was an unspoken rule that anti-Semitism could only be hinted at even if a film like The Life of Emile Zola was about it.  But over the years, the film has lost a lot of its power and it isn't aided by the fact that many of the characters are stock profiles that exude a one-dimensional feel.  Despite that fact, it still is an important film and one that can still teach a lesson as well as entertain.

From the perspective of this day and age, one can only imagine how it must have been taken.  As such it is a valuable history lesson and one can, of course, draw parallels to today's versions of racial intolerance.As far as film, I found it rather preachy, but again one has to forgive that because they were trying to make their point.  I found it long, too, and wonder how they could have condensed the many many scenes in which the principles, Peck and Malone, argued about their points of view.I also had to feel that there were some human issues that were sidetracked, such as the wisdom of subjecting the boy to the hatred of his schoolmates, just for the sake of the father's project.  It seems that the ""project"" got ahold of him and had a life of its own and he felt morally justified in sacrificing everyone else's happiness for it.  This side of the story was not told, so I did find it somewhat one-noted and tedious.  It could have been a much more interesting story if the issue was not presented in such a black and white way and the characters were not all so one-sided, but that was not the intention of the movie makers, obviously.Gregory Peck is a gorgeous man whom I could look at for hours, which is a good thing--otherwise I might have given up early on.  I didn't find Dorothy Malone to be very  beautiful so it was hard to see the instant attraction there.  She did have a certain softness which was appealing, but mostly she came across as rather dowdy.  As many others have noted, Celeste Holm brightens the screen in her every appearance and, for a while, I was hoping that Peck would leave poor Dorothy to her relatives up in Darien and get it on with the sparkling Celeste.""Ma"" was played by Anne Revere with the sort of salt-of-the-earth, down home sentimentality that was loved at the time, which sort of makes me cringe.  Likewise the John Garfield character was another stock character---the good ol' war buddy who suffers but can do no wrong--that likewise makes me want to run out of the room, but again these types were obviously much beloved in their day.This is a film that requires the modern day viewer to make quite a few allowances for the attitudes of the time.

It hangs its blatant philosophies on a paper-thin storyline that is not really about the characters portrayed by excellent cast, but about an idea.

When Gentile journalist Peck goes undercover and starts passing himself off as a Jew in order to write an expose, he encounters all sorts of prejudice--both blatant and subtle. Walking a mile in Jewish moccasins not only opens his eyes to what his Jewish childhood buddy has experienced his whole life (and by extension, all American Jews), it ends up endangering his family and his love life.The script is for the most part very heavy handed, relying far too much on lecturing rather than showing, and including many tedious, almost embarassing speeches, about what it means to be an American, what the signers of the Constitution stood for, etc.Still, it's a movie that's bound to generate interesting, and important, conversations about the nature of prejudice. Later audiences might be thinking more about how women, blacks, hispanics,gays, etc., are and have been the victims of such mindless hatred, but the message remains the same over and over again through the decades: Prejudice is an insidious, nasty phenomenon that needs to be routed out wherever it exists and in whatever form.While, in the case of Gentleman's AGreement, it may not make for superb moviemaking or art, it is certainly a subject that needs to be broached openly and often, as long as prejudice exists, and from that point of view, this is a worthwhile movie, and one that probably needed to be made when it was.",3,Good-hearted but preachy,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,1955,"['movie', 'anti-Semitism', 'plain', 'simple', 'blatant', 'philosophies', 'paper-thin', 'storyline', 'not', 'really', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'excellent', 'cast', 'idea', 'characters', 'represent', 'types', 'idealistic', 'journalist', 'put-upon', 'Jewish', 'friend', 'etc.', 'used', 'express', 'filmmakers', 'concerns.Not', 'being', 'alive', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'speak', 'accuracy', 'way', 'anti-Semitism', 'back', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'depiction', 'pretty', 'much', 'nose', 'melodramatic', 'When', 'Gentile', 'journalist', 'Peck', 'undercover', 'passing', 'off', 'Jew', 'order', 'write', 'expose', 'sorts', 'prejudice', 'blatant', 'subtle', 'Walking', 'mile', 'Jewish', 'moccasins', 'not', 'only', 'eyes', 'what', 'Jewish', 'childhood', 'buddy', 'experienced', 'whole', 'life', 'extension', 'American', 'Jews', 'up', 'endangering', 'family', 'love', 'life.The', 'script', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'heavy', 'handed', 'relying', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'lecturing', 'rather', 'showing', 'including', 'many', 'tedious', 'almost', 'embarassing', 'speeches', 'what', 'be', 'American', 'what', 'signers', 'Constitution', 'stood', 'etc.Still', 'movie', 'bound', 'generate', 'interesting', 'important', 'conversations', 'nature', 'prejudice', 'Later', 'audiences', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'more', 'how', 'women', 'blacks', 'hispanics', 'gays', 'etc.', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'victims', 'such', 'mindless', 'hatred', 'message', 'same', 'over', 'again', 'decades', 'Prejudice', 'insidious', 'nasty', 'phenomenon', 'be', 'routed', 'out', 'form.While', 'case', 'Gentleman', 'AGreement', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'superb', 'moviemaking', 'art', 'certainly', 'subject', 'be', 'broached', 'openly', 'often', 'as', 'long', 'prejudice', 'exists', 'point', 'view', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'one', 'probably', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'when', 'was']",N/A

Stavsky,"[3, 4]","The conventional wisdom is that ""Gentleman's Agreement"" was a good film about anti-Semitism but that ""Crossfire,"" which came out the same year (1947), is better, more hard-hitting.  But I still prefer ""Gentleman's Agreement.""  It's a more ""genteel"" film than ""Crossfire,"" but that's the point.  It shows how anti-Semitism existed in America, not in the virulent form that it existed in Europe, but in more subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) ways.  The title refers to the unspoken understanding among certain non-Jews that Jews would be excluded -- from certain neighborhoods, jobs, etc.In a way, the film seems dated simply because we've made a lot of progress since then.Gregory Peck is the heart of the movie.  It's hard to imagine another actor in this role.  His performance sort of foreshadows his Atticus Finch of fifteen years later in ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""Another outstanding performer is John Garfield, who, perhaps because he was Jewish in real life, brought a genuine authenticity to his role.The romantic aspect was the weakest part of the movie.  Like some of the writers on the International Movie Data Base board, I would've preferred if Phil (Peck) would've ended up with Anne (Celeste Holm), not Kathy (Dorothy McGuire).  I guess they had to go for a conventional ending.I found the Dorothy McGuire character insufferable, but I don't know how much of that is the performance and how much is the character.  But McGuire does capture a certain ""Wasp"" sensibility, especially of that time.It seems to me that the movie gets better as it progresses.  The scene towards the end of the movie, the scene in the restaurant with Garfield and McGuire, is among the most interesting, because you see the very different sensibilities of these two people (both the actors and the characters!).It's also interesting to get glimpses of the New York of sixty years ago.",4,"Somewhat Dated, But Still Good",1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,1877,"['conventional', 'wisdom', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'anti-Semitism', 'Crossfire', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year', '1947', 'better', 'more', 'hard-hitting', 'still', 'prefer', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'more', 'genteel', 'film', 'Crossfire', 'point', 'how', 'anti-Semitism', 'existed', 'America', 'not', 'virulent', 'form', 'existed', 'Europe', 'more', 'subtle', 'sometimes', 'not-so-subtle', 'ways', 'title', 'refers', 'unspoken', 'understanding', 'certain', 'non-Jews', 'Jews', 'would', 'be', 'excluded', 'certain', 'neighborhoods', 'jobs', 'etc.In', 'way', 'film', 'dated', 'simply', ""'ve"", 'made', 'lot', 'progress', 'then.Gregory', 'Peck', 'heart', 'movie', 'hard', 'imagine', 'actor', 'role', 'performance', 'sort', 'foreshadows', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'outstanding', 'performer', 'John', 'Garfield', 'who', 'perhaps', 'was', 'Jewish', 'real', 'life', 'brought', 'genuine', 'authenticity', 'role.The', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'was', 'weakest', 'part', 'movie', 'writers', 'International', 'Movie', 'Data', 'Base', 'board', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'Phil', 'Peck', 'would', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'Anne', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'not', 'Kathy', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'guess', 'had', 'go', 'conventional', 'ending.I', 'found', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'character', 'insufferable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'performance', 'how', 'much', 'character', 'McGuire', 'capture', 'certain', 'Wasp', 'sensibility', 'especially', 'time.It', 'movie', 'better', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'scene', 'restaurant', 'Garfield', 'McGuire', 'most', 'interesting', 'see', 'very', 'different', 'sensibilities', 'two', 'people', 'actors', 'characters', '.It', 'also', 'interesting', 'get', 'glimpses', 'New', 'York', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago']",N/A
324380,APRAUZ9Z7X4PI,6302640512,"talkytina ""talkytina""","[17, 22]","A fascinating story emphasizing the importance of  tolerance.  The script holds up nicely despite being over fifty years old except for intermittent scenes which suggest some of the dialogue has become a bit outdated.  However, the powerful theme will live from here to eternity.  The film most obviously concentrates on the ugliness of anti-semitism but it also contains several messages of the more subtle variety.  Gregory Peck turns in a memorable performance as a media man who encounters much hatred while pretending to be Jewish.  It's definitely worth noting that much of the anit-semitism experienced by Hollywood actors during this period was actually caused by Jewish men who were concerned about their own careers after having advanced to lofty positions in the motion picture industry where they could inflict a unique brand of oppression.  Many of these Jewish men enjoyed large salaries, and didn't want to part with their money.  The trick centered around changing one's last name, thereby concealing one's true ancestory.  It's the same or similar problem (to a lesser  extent) experienced by the Afro American community when criminals commit crimes against their &quot;brothers&quot; (statistically, Afro Americans murder mostly their own race).  The film was undoubtedly shocking in its day, largely due to the strong acting, especially the superb performance from Dorothy McGuire (of &quot;Spiral Staircase&quot;, &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; and &quot;Summer Magic&quot; fame) who inadvertantly becomes part of Peck's problem by her unintentional but insensitive behavior and comments.  The plot thickens as the main character (Peck) experiences well meaning individuals who seem to genuinely like him personally, but are not strong enough to overtly address the deep rooted hatred of Jews as a &quot;people&quot;.  It is similar and pertinent to relatively modern times when good hearted people with multi-generation ancestory in the United States try to enjoy friendships with individuals of much different racial or ethnic backgrounds.  Many of these personal relationships are genuine with the best of intentions only to discover that extended family members within the newcomer or cultural minority's family have attitudes and characteristics that are much more typical, and much less likely to result in compatibility.  &quot;Gentleman's Agreement&quot; is about expanding one's horizons and perspective, and also suggests we should give up any residue of hatred as an ultimate solution.  For example, some cultures think nothing of smelling melons and other items at the local fruit stand to help determine if the particular piece of food is ripe.  Seeing nose hairs brush against the consumable item is highly offensive and typically not well understood or accepted in American culture.  It may seem benign or somewhat silly but it reflects what happens when an individual who is &quot;different&quot; is finally accepted while an entire race or culture is NOT! The &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; becomes NOT to discuss that such thought processes exist, and are indeed presently occurring! It is not easy to discuss that your culture of people speaks a harsher sounding dialect or is flat noisier or louder. Furthermore, the &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; includes the unwritten (and perhaps unspeakable) &quot;bylaw&quot; that I may like certain things about you, but I would never admit hating the fact that your race or culture of people has immigrated and/or are now living here!  After all, it's much easier to interact among those with whom we are most familiar!  Any doubts that &quot;Gentleman's Agreement&quot; is less than a &quot;5-star&quot; movie are erased by the fact that the movie still provokes deep levels of discussion among future generations for which it undoubtedly wasn't even targeting!  DVD quality is excellent, and much better than expected.

324382,ACM90BRKX73OG,6302640512,Tom,"[0, 0]","Gentleman's Agreement (20th Century Fox, 1947) was director Elia Kazan's fourth film.Journalist Phil Green (Gregory Peck) moves to New York with his young son, Tommy (Dean Stockwell), and mother (Anne Revere) to write an expose on anti-Semitism. Green racks his brain trying to come up with a story angle, eventually deciding to pose as a Jew. His new girlfriend, Kathy Lacey (Dorothy McGuire), is privy to the scheme, but tensions arise when she insists on letting her friends and family know her boyfriend isn't really Jewish. Green discovers prejudice everywhere, even at the office.  His friend, discharged serviceman, Dave (John Garfield), an actual Jew, moves in looking for a job and a home and also encounters intolerance. Green's expose is finally published, Kathy faces her own lack of bravery in confronting bigotry, and the two live happily ever after.Gentleman's Agreement won Best Picture for 20th Century Fox mogul, Darryl F. Zanuck, Best Director for Elia Kazan, and Best Supporting Actress for Celeste Holme.  Wooden Indian Peck plays one note throughout as the over-earnest writer. Lovely Dorothy McGuire is actually quite good as the high society-conscious girlfriend but Kathy's constant tifts with Green over his faux Jewish identity are grating. Ann Revere's new world liberal soapbox soliloquy is embarrassing. Dean Stockwell is convincing as Tommy. June Havoc does a wonderful job in the role of Green's Jewish secretary, Elaine Wales. Romance-starved Gal Friday, Anne Dettry (Celeste Holm) follows Green around like she's in heat. Garfield shines in his role. Peck, McGuire, and Revere were nominated for Oscars.Gentleman's Agreement was another of Zanuck's many social crusades. Hollywood's Jewish moguls tried to convince him not to make the movie fearing a backlash. Kazan was highly critical of the film in later writings and interviews. While it might have been a candy-coated look at bigotry, as was his next film, Pinky, it was brave and cutting edge cinema for its day. The scene where Green attempts to book a room as a Jew at a restricted hotel is riveting. Due to its liberal message several of those associated with the film were called before the House Un-American Committee including Kazan, Zanuck, Revere, and Garfield.The DVD has a fairly informative commentary by film critic, Richard Shickel,  with additional comments from Celeste Holm and June Havoc.",3,Kazan exposes anti-Semitism,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,2395,"['Gentleman', 'Agreement', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', '1947', 'was', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'fourth', 'film.Journalist', 'Phil', 'Green', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'New', 'York', 'young', 'son', 'Tommy', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'mother', 'Anne', 'Revere', 'write', 'expose', 'anti-Semitism', 'Green', 'brain', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'story', 'angle', 'eventually', 'deciding', 'pose', 'Jew', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Kathy', 'Lacey', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'privy', 'scheme', 'tensions', 'arise', 'when', 'letting', 'friends', 'family', 'know', 'boyfriend', ""n't"", 'really', 'Jewish', 'Green', 'discovers', 'prejudice', 'everywhere', 'even', 'office', 'friend', 'discharged', 'serviceman', 'Dave', 'John', 'Garfield', 'actual', 'Jew', 'moves', 'looking', 'job', 'home', 'also', 'encounters', 'intolerance', 'Green', 'expose', 'finally', 'published', 'Kathy', 'own', 'lack', 'bravery', 'confronting', 'bigotry', 'two', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'mogul', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'Best', 'Director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Celeste', 'Holme', 'Wooden', 'Indian', 'Peck', 'one', 'note', 'over-earnest', 'writer', 'Lovely', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'high', 'society-conscious', 'girlfriend', 'Kathy', 'constant', 'tifts', 'Green', 'faux', 'Jewish', 'identity', 'are', 'grating', 'Ann', 'Revere', 'new', 'world', 'liberal', 'soapbox', 'soliloquy', 'embarrassing', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'convincing', 'Tommy', 'June', 'Havoc', 'wonderful', 'job', 'role', 'Green', 'Jewish', 'secretary', 'Elaine', 'Wales', 'Romance-starved', 'Gal', 'Friday', 'Anne', 'Dettry', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'Green', 'heat', 'Garfield', 'shines', 'role', 'Peck', 'McGuire', 'Revere', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars.Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'was', 'Zanuck', 'many', 'social', 'crusades', 'Hollywood', 'Jewish', 'moguls', 'tried', 'convince', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'fearing', 'backlash', 'Kazan', 'was', 'highly', 'critical', 'film', 'later', 'writings', 'interviews', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'candy-coated', 'look', 'bigotry', 'was', 'next', 'film', 'Pinky', 'was', 'brave', 'cutting', 'edge', 'cinema', 'day', 'scene', 'where', 'Green', 'book', 'room', 'Jew', 'restricted', 'hotel', 'riveting', 'Due', 'liberal', 'message', 'several', 'associated', 'film', 'were', 'called', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Committee', 'including', 'Kazan', 'Zanuck', 'Revere', 'Garfield.The', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'informative', 'commentary', 'film', 'critic', 'Richard', 'Shickel', 'additional', 'comments', 'Celeste', 'Holm', 'June', 'Havoc']",N/A

When the film came out, it was considered controversial. I say more power to the film and was glad it was made. However, keep in mind the film is over 55 years old and while the issue of racism is valid even today in some parts of the country, it comes across as somewhat outdated. The saving grace is the script. It manages to inform without pontificating and really hits on a surprising amount of aspects. Example of a great exchange:""Why, some of my best friends are jewish""""And some of your best friends are methodist also.

The storyline was good enough - definitely worth the effort of sitting through the movie - but (like some other reviewers here have suggested) it is very heavy-handed, at times... clumsily written, at other times... with an unfortunate performance by Dorothy McGuire.If you've not seen Dorothy McGuire in a movie before, do not judge her by this performance!  Instead, watch her in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and you'll see what a brilliant actress she was.  Unfortunately, in Gentleman's Agreement, her onscreen presence was annoying - practically ruining every scene she was in (for me, anyway).  To her credit, though, she had one of the worst parts in the movie to convey - a difficult character, but also a badly-written character, too.  It's hard to picture any actress being able to say some of the clumsy dialogue they gave her.  (It didn't help that her make-up was also unflattering...)  In almost all of her scenes, she had the same half-smile, dreamy-eyed look... regardless of what she was saying - as if she were a robot without a thought in her head.  Too bad.  She is a much, much better actress than what is presented here.Gregory Peck was fine.  John Garfield was fine.  Ann Revere was great.  Dean Stockwell was also pretty terrific (unusual for a child actor to not be cloying, back in 1940's Hollywood).BUT, the movie belongs to Celeste Holm.  Truthfully, I've never really been a great fan of hers, but now?  I feel like I need to re-review anything I've seen her in.  She is fantastic in this movie - subtle, witty, intelligent, feeling, and beautiful.  I did not know she'd won the Academy Award for this movie, but - after having seen it - I can understand why.  The movie may be 50+ years old (and showing its age), but whenever Celeste Holm comes onscreen, the movie is suddenly vibrant and alive.  Bravo, Celeste.Another surprise was June Havoc's performance.  Like Celeste Holm, June Havoc makes the movie come alive.  Suddenly, Gregory Peck seems a little less wooden, when he's on camera with Havoc.  June Havoc is wonderful in this movie.Unfortunately, much of the movie (in this day & age, now) reminds me of something we would've had to watch in high school, during an American History class...

I haven't seen a film about blacks, Asians or Muslims that digs so deep into the perception of a group beyond the hackneyed bigot spouting stereotypical ethnic slurs. No, racism goes deeper, is more insidious, and I liked how all varieties of racism are expressed, from backhanded ""compliments"" (""Aren't you in PR? You people are clever"" - from a guy assuming Peck must be in that field because he's Jewish) - to implications that Jews are crafty and dishonest (""that doctor strings people along and overcharges, you know what I mean"") to ""Jewish anti-semites"" - self-hating Jews would harbor their own bigotry - to ""silent racism"" - the over-polite manner of the bigoted hotel owner who unapologetically turns Peck away without a ruffle of his suit. While it focuses on Anti-semitism, any member of a minority or oppressed group can easily identify with the protagonist.To understand why this film was made, I tend to see it as a reaction to America's war whoop of superiority following WWII in which Hitler's death camps were unveiled to a horrified world. After being confronted with that shock of genocide, many in the U.S. probably tried to reassure themselves ""it couldn't happen here."" That it COULD have happened here (and it did, in a milder form with Japanese-Americans being interned in concentration camps) is brought home by this film, which served as a reminder that the U.S. and German attitudes toward the Jews weren't different. This film humbles us and reminds us that racism and prejudice spare no country, and that, before we think so mighty of ourselves and our ideals of equality, we should take a hard look at ourselves and acknowledge our shortcomings.",4,More Open and Honest Than Some of Today's Films,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,2100,"['preachy', 'times', 'avalanche', 'Anti-semitic', 'incidents', 'one', 'following', 'rapidly', 'heels', 'feels', 'too', 'coincidental', 'viewer', 'tempted', 'wonder', 'what', 'bad', 'thing', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'horror', 'film', 'film', 'feels', 'paradoxically', 'more', 'open', 'honest', 'exposing', 'hypocrisy', 'so-called', 'liberal', 'people', 'today', 'films', 'unflinchingly', 'subtleties', 'prejudice', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'blacks', 'Asians', 'Muslims', 'digs', 'so', 'deep', 'perception', 'group', 'hackneyed', 'bigot', 'spouting', 'stereotypical', 'ethnic', 'slurs', 'No', 'racism', 'deeper', 'more', 'insidious', 'liked', 'how', 'varieties', 'racism', 'are', 'expressed', 'backhanded', 'compliments', 'Are', ""n't"", 'PR', 'people', 'are', 'clever', 'guy', 'assuming', 'Peck', 'must', 'be', 'field', 'Jewish', 'implications', 'Jews', 'are', 'crafty', 'dishonest', 'doctor', 'people', 'overcharges', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Jewish', 'anti-semites', 'self-hating', 'Jews', 'would', 'harbor', 'own', 'bigotry', 'silent', 'racism', 'over-polite', 'manner', 'bigoted', 'hotel', 'owner', 'who', 'unapologetically', 'Peck', 'away', 'ruffle', 'suit', 'Anti-semitism', 'member', 'minority', 'oppressed', 'group', 'can', 'easily', 'identify', 'protagonist.To', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'tend', 'see', 'reaction', 'America', 'war', 'whoop', 'superiority', 'following', 'WWII', 'Hitler', 'death', 'camps', 'were', 'unveiled', 'horrified', 'world', 'being', 'confronted', 'shock', 'genocide', 'many', 'U.S.', 'probably', 'tried', 'reassure', 'could', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'COULD', 'have', 'happened', 'here', 'did', 'milder', 'form', 'Japanese-Americans', 'being', 'interned', 'concentration', 'camps', 'brought', 'home', 'film', 'served', 'reminder', 'U.S.', 'German', 'Jews', 'were', ""n't"", 'different', 'film', 'racism', 'prejudice', 'spare', 'country', 'think', 'so', 'mighty', 'ourselves', 'ideals', 'equality', 'should', 'take', 'hard', 'look', 'ourselves', 'acknowledge', 'shortcomings']",N/A

Zanuck tackled the subject of lynch law injustice in &quot;The Ox Bow Incident.&quot;  In 1948 he battled anti-Semitism with equally brilliant results in &quot;Gentleman's Agreement,&quot; which starred Gregory Peck and was directed with a stellar hand by Elia Kazan.Peck plays a New York magazine writer who decides to do a comprehensive study of what it is like to live as a Jew.  One of the film's most powerful scenes occurs when Peck, giving the name he is using for his investigation, Green, is turned away when he seeks to register at a prominent hotel, with a policy of turning away Jews.  He learns much as well about the struggle of Jewish Americans in interacting with his friend John Garfield, an Army officer with much insight to reveal.His involvement in the controversial experiment and ultimately expose causes Peck problems with his girlfriend Dorothy McGuire.  Eventually she sees the light and recognizes an important truism as she states that at least in the cases of anti-Semitic bigots one knows where one stands.  She observes the more outwardly subtle problem of people on the one hand proclaiming themselves as liberal and without prejudice, but also playing it safe and refusing to stand up for injustice when it occurs, such as when anti-Jewish jokes are told at cocktail parties or slights are observed which stem from bigotry and nothing is said.&quot;Gentleman's Agreement&quot; was a bold step forward for Hollywood in facing up to realities in post-World War Two America.  Zanuck and Kazan would also tackle the subject of race in the sensitively done &quot;Pinky&quot; with Jeanne Crain one year later in 1949.  Crain is a young woman with African American blood who attempts to pass for white in a society affected by racism.",5,A Powerful Study of Anti-Semitism,1010016000,"01 3, 2002",2002,1832,"['little', 'less', 'decade', 'earlier', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'tackled', 'subject', 'lynch', 'law', 'injustice', 'quot', 'Ox', 'Bow', 'Incident.', 'quot', '1948', 'battled', 'anti-Semitism', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'results', 'quot', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'quot', 'starred', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'directed', 'stellar', 'hand', 'Elia', 'Kazan.Peck', 'New', 'York', 'magazine', 'writer', 'who', 'do', 'comprehensive', 'study', 'what', 'live', 'Jew', 'One', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'when', 'Peck', 'giving', 'name', 'using', 'investigation', 'Green', 'turned', 'away', 'when', 'register', 'prominent', 'hotel', 'policy', 'turning', 'away', 'Jews', 'much', 'as', 'well', 'struggle', 'Jewish', 'Americans', 'interacting', 'friend', 'John', 'Garfield', 'Army', 'officer', 'much', 'insight', 'reveal.His', 'involvement', 'controversial', 'experiment', 'ultimately', 'expose', 'causes', 'Peck', 'problems', 'girlfriend', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'Eventually', 'light', 'important', 'truism', 'least', 'cases', 'anti-Semitic', 'bigots', 'one', 'where', 'one', 'more', 'outwardly', 'subtle', 'problem', 'people', 'one', 'hand', 'proclaiming', 'liberal', 'prejudice', 'also', 'playing', 'safe', 'refusing', 'stand', 'up', 'injustice', 'when', 'such', 'when', 'anti-Jewish', 'jokes', 'are', 'told', 'cocktail', 'parties', 'slights', 'are', 'observed', 'stem', 'bigotry', 'nothing', 'said.', 'quot', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', 'quot', 'was', 'bold', 'step', 'forward', 'Hollywood', 'facing', 'up', 'realities', 'post-World', 'War', 'Two', 'America', 'Zanuck', 'Kazan', 'would', 'also', 'tackle', 'subject', 'race', 'sensitively', 'done', 'quot', 'Pinky', 'quot', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'one', 'year', 'later', '1949', 'Crain', 'young', 'woman', 'African', 'American', 'blood', 'who', 'pass', 'white', 'society', 'affected', 'racism']",N/A
