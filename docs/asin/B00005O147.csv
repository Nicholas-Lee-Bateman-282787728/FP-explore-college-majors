671322,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B00005O147,Alric the Red,"[25, 40]","First, the music here is first rate. As musicians, they've clearly done their homework. So I give it a high rating because the musicianship is so accomplished. However, as performers, they seemed like what they are (as I discovered from watching the bonus material): session musicians, and therefore not used to the direct glare of the limelight. As people unfamiliar with this aspect of performing, they seemed unsure what to do in the crosshairs of all of that attention, and their exuberance seemed contrived. Haylie's (the first violinist and evident spokesperson) rock-and-roll exhortations were diluted by her giddiness at finding herself and her cohorts front and center of this big show, instead of in their usual seats, a couple of rows back under a conductor's baton, which was where they had been sitting before this brainstorm struck them (or whomever).The thing was, the show had a contrived spectacularity to it without the performers themselves being individually spectacular or dazzling in any way, thus unable to genuinely participate in the thing they were trying to create. I think they were debuted prematurely, before they had the experience to deal with this sort of presentation. Also, the sexuality they so blatantly flaunted on the keep case and album cover was nonexistent. They were simply out of their league, the band a mere business enterprise designed to cash in by sexualizing classical performers. It's a gimmick that falls flat. Whoever planned the image for these women overlooked the fact that sensuality in performers is an aspect of self-awareness and confidence. People like Madonna and Sarah Brightman and Shania Twain are sexy because they're totally aware of themselves, possessing a relationship with their audiences that requires lots of practice and experience.  All of the women I just mentioned spent years on the stage perfecting their craft. It's not just a question of donning tight clothes and changing how your eye makeup is applied. It's obvious that the women in Bond are not genuine to the gimmick they've chosen. This comes off as ""Josie and the Pussycats Do the Classics.""Despite all of that, the music is very good. But so what? Why did it require this sort of presentation? Sarah Brightman, in her ownSarah Brightman in Concert, in the very same hall, simply performs, allowing her talent to carry the show, to dazzle us, transfixing us in awe. While Bond's music is good, I'm not so awed by it. There's nothing that unusual about the music itself beyond their gimmick, which flatly failed.  In some ways, the show was an annoying distraction to the good things going on. These are intelligent, talented, and attractive women, and they should present themselves more honestly. I would have preferred they wore beautiful evening gowns instead of the cheesy attire they selected just because someone believed the outfits were ""sexy.""Perhaps I'm being too harsh. Once the novelty of the bigness of what's happened to them wears off, maybe they'll get more in tune with their own presentation, and the next DVD (if they survive as an act) will be better. For now, I recommend this DVD, since the cost is reasonable and the music is good. But don't expect to be seduced and spellbound, as if Sirens were playing classical music.",4,"Good musicians, amateurish performers",1007337600,"12 3, 2001",2001,3282,"['First', 'music', 'here', 'first', 'rate', 'musicians', ""'ve"", 'clearly', 'done', 'homework', 'give', 'high', 'rating', 'musicianship', 'so', 'accomplished', 'However', 'performers', 'seemed', 'what', 'are', 'discovered', 'watching', 'bonus', 'material', 'session', 'musicians', 'therefore', 'not', 'used', 'direct', 'glare', 'limelight', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'aspect', 'performing', 'seemed', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'crosshairs', 'attention', 'exuberance', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'Haylie', 'first', 'violinist', 'evident', 'spokesperson', 'rock-and-roll', 'exhortations', 'were', 'diluted', 'giddiness', 'finding', 'cohorts', 'front', 'center', 'big', 'show', 'instead', 'usual', 'seats', 'couple', 'rows', 'back', 'conductor', 'baton', 'was', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'sitting', 'brainstorm', 'struck', 'whomever', '.The', 'thing', 'was', 'show', 'had', 'contrived', 'spectacularity', 'performers', 'being', 'individually', 'spectacular', 'dazzling', 'way', 'thus', 'unable', 'genuinely', 'participate', 'thing', 'were', 'trying', 'create', 'think', 'were', 'debuted', 'prematurely', 'had', 'experience', 'deal', 'sort', 'presentation', 'Also', 'sexuality', 'so', 'blatantly', 'flaunted', 'keep', 'case', 'album', 'cover', 'was', 'nonexistent', 'were', 'simply', 'league', 'band', 'mere', 'business', 'enterprise', 'designed', 'cash', 'sexualizing', 'classical', 'performers', 'gimmick', 'flat', 'planned', 'image', 'women', 'overlooked', 'fact', 'sensuality', 'performers', 'aspect', 'self-awareness', 'confidence', 'People', 'Madonna', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Shania', 'Twain', 'are', 'sexy', ""'re"", 'totally', 'aware', 'possessing', 'relationship', 'audiences', 'lots', 'practice', 'experience', 'women', 'just', 'mentioned', 'spent', 'years', 'stage', 'perfecting', 'craft', 'not', 'just', 'question', 'donning', 'tight', 'clothes', 'changing', 'how', 'eye', 'makeup', 'applied', 'obvious', 'women', 'Bond', 'are', 'not', 'genuine', 'gimmick', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'off', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'Do', 'Classics', 'music', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'what', 'Why', 'did', 'require', 'sort', 'presentation', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'ownSarah', 'Brightman', 'Concert', 'very', 'same', 'hall', 'simply', 'performs', 'allowing', 'talent', 'carry', 'show', 'dazzle', 'transfixing', 'awe', 'Bond', 'music', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'awed', 'nothing', 'unusual', 'music', 'gimmick', 'flatly', 'failed', 'ways', 'show', 'was', 'annoying', 'distraction', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'are', 'intelligent', 'talented', 'attractive', 'women', 'should', 'present', 'more', 'honestly', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'wore', 'beautiful', 'evening', 'gowns', 'instead', 'cheesy', 'attire', 'selected', 'just', 'someone', 'believed', 'outfits', 'were', 'sexy', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'novelty', 'bigness', 'what', 'happened', 'wears', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'tune', 'own', 'presentation', 'next', 'DVD', 'survive', 'act', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'now', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'cost', 'reasonable', 'music', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'seduced', 'spellbound', 'Sirens', 'were', 'playing', 'classical', 'music']",N/A

To see the music being played visually by the 4 members of the classically-trained quartet, was amazing. It's always nice to see the people behind the sounds of the music, and in the case of Bond, not bad at all.The DVD features tracks from their first album, ""Born"", ""Dallas"", and a mix of ""Victory"".The DVD itself has some extras, one music video of ""Wintersun"" and another of a performance of ""Viva [Orion Mix]"". There is also an inteviews with the members of Bond, and even a short 10 question quiz. Answering correctly on all questions unlocks a video of ""Victory"" and their stay in Cuba where they had taped the music video for ""Victory"". The questions themselves are not hard to answer, if you make a mistake you can always re-take the quiz. It has the same questions again.The actual concert was quite a drag in sense of excitement, visuals, performance, and prescence. The girls walk around and dance when they are not playing their instruments, I don't think having an actual dance choregraphy would have helped either sides. It was understandable that they would remain rigid and still to play their instruments. The girls played their songs back to back.. there was no real scene changes or clothes changes. The stage itself didn't lend much help as the lighting was simple and the stage itself, very small and bare. The one thing I liked about the concert was that it was truly live.. there was a small group of people playing in the background, with the band consisting of a guitar, bass, drums, percussions, and a keyboard/mixer. In between songs however, one of the girls would say something about the concert or say something about themselves. Gay-Yee introduced the members of the band, though I thought that was unneccesary. After all, do they introduce the characters in a play mid-way? They could have kept the mood going, without interruptions. It was basically just song after song that were played.. ""Duel"" was interesting to watch as Haylie and Eos ""dueled"" with their instruments while they played. ""Victory"" and after that was ""Victory (Carnival Mix)"" which I did not notice a difference between the two songs. During the Carnival Mix, a bunch of dancers come out, clowns come, lights go crazy.. it's pretty bland. Their attempt at making that songs ""carnival-like"" and more ""fun"".It was awesome to see Bond actually perform live.. but the performance lacked so much. As they are going on tour in the U.S. of the summer of 2004.. I hope they improve greatly on the performance itself, because the music, especially their new album, ""Classified"" does not need any work, and never had.",4,It's always hard the first time around..,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,2729,"['Haylie', 'concert', 'very', 'first', 'live', 'performance', 'ever', '.Being', 'fan', 'Bond', 'love', 'music', 'see', 'music', 'being', 'played', 'visually', '4', 'members', 'classically-trained', 'quartet', 'was', 'amazing', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'people', 'sounds', 'music', 'case', 'Bond', 'not', 'bad', 'all.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'tracks', 'first', 'album', 'Born', 'Dallas', 'mix', 'Victory', '.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'one', 'music', 'video', 'Wintersun', 'performance', 'Viva', '[', 'Orion', 'Mix', ']', 'also', 'inteviews', 'members', 'Bond', 'even', 'short', '10', 'question', 'quiz', 'Answering', 'correctly', 'questions', 'video', 'Victory', 'stay', 'Cuba', 'where', 'had', 'taped', 'music', 'video', 'Victory', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'hard', 'answer', 'make', 'mistake', 'can', 'always', 're-take', 'quiz', 'same', 'questions', 'again.The', 'actual', 'concert', 'was', 'quite', 'drag', 'sense', 'excitement', 'visuals', 'performance', 'prescence', 'girls', 'walk', 'dance', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'playing', 'instruments', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'having', 'actual', 'dance', 'choregraphy', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'sides', 'was', 'understandable', 'would', 'remain', 'rigid', 'still', 'play', 'instruments', 'girls', 'played', 'songs', 'back', 'back..', 'was', 'real', 'scene', 'changes', 'clothes', 'changes', 'stage', 'did', ""n't"", 'lend', 'much', 'help', 'lighting', 'was', 'simple', 'stage', 'very', 'small', 'bare', 'one', 'thing', 'liked', 'concert', 'was', 'was', 'truly', 'live..', 'was', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'playing', 'background', 'band', 'consisting', 'guitar', 'bass', 'drums', 'percussions', 'keyboard/mixer', 'songs', 'however', 'one', 'girls', 'would', 'say', 'something', 'concert', 'say', 'something', 'Gay-Yee', 'introduced', 'members', 'band', 'thought', 'was', 'unneccesary', 'do', 'introduce', 'characters', 'play', 'mid-way', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'mood', 'going', 'interruptions', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'song', 'song', 'were', 'played..', 'Duel', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Haylie', 'Eos', 'dueled', 'instruments', 'played', 'Victory', 'was', 'Victory', 'Carnival', 'Mix', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'difference', 'two', 'songs', 'Carnival', 'Mix', 'bunch', 'dancers', 'come', 'out', 'clowns', 'come', 'lights', 'go', 'crazy..', 'pretty', 'bland', 'attempt', 'making', 'songs', 'carnival-like', 'more', 'fun', '.It', 'was', 'awesome', 'see', 'Bond', 'actually', 'perform', 'live..', 'performance', 'lacked', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'going', 'tour', 'U.S.', 'summer', '2004..', 'hope', 'improve', 'greatly', 'performance', 'music', 'especially', 'new', 'album', 'Classified', 'not', 'need', 'work', 'never', 'had']",N/A

671330,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B00005O147,Erica Anderson,"[5, 5]","I finally got around to renting Bond's dvd ""Live at the Royal Albert Hall"". I have been a big fan of the classical/pop quartet for almost five years now. I unfortunately had other prior engagments around the time of their concert last year and had to miss seeing them live so I had to see what they were like live (sort of).Their performance at the Royal Albert Hall was their debut live performance back in 2001. I will start with the two flaws I found with the dvd. The production on the dvd sounded awfully like the music came from the studio as opposed to a live performance. In  other words, the allegedly live dvd did not exactly sound 'live' per say. This cheapens the band's reputation as a band if the performance dvd sounds much too polished. The second flaw with the dvd is that I could not tell if I was hearing the girls play their stringed instruments of if that was the orchestra. Including other musicians playing stringed instruments drowned out the girls' playing.With that aside, I found the performance engergetic and invigorating unlike a lot of rock bands nowadays. The girls showed a lot of enthusiasm towards performing which I don't see in a lot of rock bands today who just stand there on the stage and play their bloody instruments. I just loved how excited the girls were to be performing live. A lot of rock bands today could learn a thing or two about showing a little more enthusiasm towards performing from them.I loved all of the songs but I especially loved the band's cover of the ""Dallas"" theme song. I wished that was included on any of their albums. It had that huge epic sound that I have always loved. My other favorite song they performed was the sweeping ballad ""Belladonna"". Just a beautiful song.The bonus footage was pretty minimal. I liked the interviews and the two videos for ""Viva"" and ""Wintersun"". What no ""Victory""? If and when the band puts out another live dvd, I sure hope the sound quality is more convincing that what I heard on this dvd.

Lizzi,"[16, 19]","Even though I thought the Spice Girls were a blast, I was hoping Bond would NOT turn out to be a new-age/classical-goes-Top-40 reincarnation (not having heard the CD, this disc is my true introduction to these artists).  The quartet may have been assembled by someone with dollar signs in mind, but no matter:  these women are fine, classically trained musicians, having honed their skills through session work and/or orchestral experience.Each of the thirteen tracks is superb, with ""Quixote,"" ""Alexander the Great,"" ""Kismet,"" ""Korobushka,"" and ""Victory"" being my favorite songs.  Not truly classical, but the accompanying band and string section provide a symphonic feel to the moving musical themes.  While not yet fully poised and articulate on stage (each one takes a turn at addressing the audience), the women score highly in musical aptitude, cohesion as an ensemble, energy and flair.  Perhaps too much flair at times:  the running around on stage and violin bow theatrics may have been a tad excessive.  Also, Haylie's (first violin) giddy, rah-rah introductions and her rock 'n' roll body language seemed an odd mix in comparison to her more subdued band mates.  The ""babe factor"" is clearly pumped up by the midriff-baring outfits and some gyrating hips during the more danceable tunes.  I also noticed:  the audio-video aspects seemed to be slightly out of sync for some of the show, with the sound ahead by a split second.  I tried hard not to dwell on this.  The camera/editing work is very good, alternating between the individuals and interacting band mates, yet thankfully minimizing the overly rapid edits.  I could have done without the overhead spinning camera.Aside from the performance itself, the DVD ""extras"" include four videos, which I though were REAL cool, although two of them you can't get to without first taking a quiz (fun...the first time).  The 13-minute ""exclusive"" interview was so-so, with hollow-sounding voices and camera shots superimposed on a still background.  The photo gallery is no big deal.Overall, these ""Bond girls"" are truly accomplished musicians who can put on a captivating show.

In fact, they all do.I discovered Bond through listening to Vanessa Mae, who was also produced by Mike Batt early on in her career. Batt has been able to tap into something with these artists to make them a commercial success. It's a blending of classical and pop, culture and curves, high brow and vegas, bach and buttocks (get the idea?). The essential ingredients are 1) talent and 2) looks. Both Mae and Bond qualify, although the talent part is always going to be debated by the classical purists.In this DVD you get a good sense of what Bond is all about. The video and audio are excellent, except for the times when the members are speaking to the audience and it sounds like you're listening from the backstage area. The performances are good, although like the other reviewer one wonders if there isn't some syncing going on. There are bonuses as well, with videos and interviews of Bond which I enjoyed.The problem with this DVD is that it's a bit overdone. A little butt-shaking is fine, but an hour of it can get old, even with Haylie. The final number (Victory Reprise) has dancers and musicians all over the stage in a frenzied free-for-all. Vanessa Mae's perfomance at the Royal Albert Hall was a much more balanced approach in my opinion.  Unlike Bond she played a few classical pieces.  It would have been great to see them play a couple of classical quartet pieces to showcase their classical skills and counter the discolike pieces during the rest of the performance.  Hopefully Bond will be able to capture that balance in the future.",4,Shaken - Not stirred,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,1678,"['am', 'love', 'Haylie', 'lead', 'violinist', 'cutest', 'fiddler', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'as', 'good', 'fact', 'do.I', 'discovered', 'Bond', 'listening', 'Vanessa', 'Mae', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'produced', 'Mike', 'Batt', 'early', 'career', 'Batt', 'been', 'able', 'tap', 'something', 'artists', 'make', 'commercial', 'success', 'blending', 'classical', 'pop', 'culture', 'curves', 'high', 'brow', 'vegas', 'bach', 'buttocks', 'get', 'idea', 'essential', 'ingredients', 'are', '1', 'talent', '2', 'Mae', 'Bond', 'qualify', 'talent', 'part', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'debated', 'classical', 'purists.In', 'DVD', 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'what', 'Bond', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'excellent', 'times', 'when', 'members', 'are', 'speaking', 'audience', ""'re"", 'listening', 'backstage', 'area', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'other', 'reviewer', 'one', 'wonders', ""n't"", 'syncing', 'going', 'are', 'bonuses', 'as', 'well', 'videos', 'interviews', 'Bond', 'enjoyed.The', 'problem', 'DVD', 'bit', 'overdone', 'little', 'butt-shaking', 'fine', 'hour', 'can', 'get', 'old', 'even', 'Haylie', 'final', 'number', 'Victory', 'Reprise', 'dancers', 'musicians', 'stage', 'frenzied', 'free-for-all', 'Vanessa', 'Mae', 'perfomance', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'balanced', 'approach', 'opinion', 'Bond', 'played', 'few', 'classical', 'pieces', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'see', 'play', 'couple', 'classical', 'quartet', 'pieces', 'showcase', 'classical', 'skills', 'counter', 'discolike', 'pieces', 'rest', 'performance', 'Hopefully', 'Bond', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'capture', 'balance', 'future']",N/A

However, anyone who says that their 'Coyote Ugly'-esque costumes are the evidence that Bond 'isn't about making classical music cool, it's about sex' don't know too many 24-year-old women. My credentials in this area come from two sources: first as a classically trained singer (as such I'm professionally familiar with orchestras) and as the friend of numerous women in their twenties. From women at my work to women I've sung with, I've covered many differant personality-types, and with only a few exceptions they would all love to get out on stage and play sex-kitten for a night. As a band, Bond is about re-vamping Classical music, the leather pants and low-cut silk shirts are simply the natural result of young women getting to pick their wardrobes when money is no object. With that out of the way...Bond has to be one of greatest ideas for a 'reinvention' of a genre ever. Quickly after William Orbit's 'Barber's Adagio for strings' took over clubs some record excutive decided to see if he could make a band out of it. Are the four 'Bond girls' a manufactored quintet, of course! But when was the last time you heard of a twelve piece orchestra coming together because they met in college and thought playing together would be fun? Of course Bond is four string-players, but they tour with an actual orchestra, complemented by DJs and a standard rock-band. So the CD is an orchestral endevour, Bond is simply the figure-head. Kind of like Bruce Springsteen's last album.In sort, disregard what you've heard disparaging Bond's artistic credibility. Think only of Paul Oakenfold getting a hold of Beethoven's fifth symphony, run through a few bars, and if you like, jump on the Bond wagon.
