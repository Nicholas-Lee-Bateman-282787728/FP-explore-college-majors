They make love, but she is gone when he wakes up in the morning. He never saw her face but believes himself in love with her.The rest of the film is about Matt's quest to find ""the one."" All he has is her panties, so he goes about trying to find the matching bra by sneaking into all the rooms in the dorm. When that doesn't work, he makes friends with the girls who live there, trying to ferret out his love. He even resorts to posing as a woman himself.Much of Matt's dialog and voiceover is about the differences between men and women, men's fears, and the struggle to figure out how to be a man. Unfortunately, it also contains anti-feminist rants, especially directed towards the Women's Studies class professor. What might be a cute comedy in some ways becomes annoying with these elements, in addition to some adolescent sexual anatomy jokes.In the last ten minutes, two of the students are revealed to be lesbians.

It was a VERY easy and enjoyable movie to watch.  I can see where people would draw comparisons between &quot;100 Girls&quot; and such movies as &quot;American Pie&quot; ... mainly because of the &quot;typical teenage life experiences&quot; (even though in this movie, they are in college).  I won't say it was better than American Pie necessarily ... just different, and smarter.  The dialogue was very witty and funny!  Tons of good actors/actresses in the movie too.  I'm just taking a guess here, but I am thinking maybe they didn't release it in the US because of all the racy nudity and content of the scenes ... in Europe, I believe they are a little more open to stuff like that.  If it had been out in the states, even if they had cut some stuff out, it probably would have still been rated R and unfortunately I guess they assumed that the main people whom would benefit from or enjoy seeing this movie, are perhaps under 17.  I don't know, just a guess.  But I would definitely recommend seeing &quot;100 Girls&quot; ... it's touching, cleaver and humorous.

666831,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00005N89G,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","100 Girls / B0014D5PO8*Spoilers*Though I don't usually go for romantic comedies, ""100 Girls"" is a standby favorite of mine. When Matt is trapped in an elevator during a power outage with a girl whose face he didn't see (obscured by a large load of laundry she was taking to the dorm laundry room), he finds that the anonymity of darkness allows him to overcome his shyness and actually talk to the other girl, rather than his usual response of being stunned into tongue-tied silence. Several meaningful conversations later, they share an incredible sexual interlude in the dark elevator, and Matt wakes the next morning hopelessly in love...and no idea as to the identify of his 'mystery girl'.So begins his quest: Matt has one semester to figure out which of the 100 girls in the dorm in question is the woman of his dreams.Matt tries several terrible attempts to figure out the identity of his dream girl via logic and reason - including an ill-fated attempt to find the matching undies to the pair that was left behind in the elevator - when he finally comes to understand that in order to find the answer, he actually has to get to know these girls. Intimately, as a friend. And as Matt explores these new friendships, he comes to understand more about women, more about himself, and more about gender relations than he ever imagined.I love this movie because each of the characters starts out as a movie stereotype and ends - as Matt comes to understand them - as a wonderful, complete human being. The gorgeous goddess who has every man writing in her palm secretly worries that no one will ever take her seriously because it will always be assumed that she had help with her homework. The ugly smart girl who spends every evening reading alone in the library comes to realize that she is beautiful and sexy, despite a lifetime of feeling otherwise. The sporty girl who never wears makeup and has five brothers and no sisters just wants to be treated seriously as a human being, and not shoved into a category. The perfect ""girl next door"" obsesses that her strict mother won't accept her for who she really is. For each and every girl in the dorm, Matt realizes that they are human beings - like him - and that, like him, they each have individual hopes, dreams, fears, and secrets. And, like him, they find romantic entanglements to be just as scary and fraught with peril as he.

666832,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B00005N89G,Beau Yarbrough,"[2, 9]","It's ironic, but ""100 Girls,"" about a guy trying to hook up (again) with the perfect girl falls flat because, like so many guys, it just tries too hard.The premise is cute enough, and certainly no less plausible than most teen sex movies: After a romantic and erotic experience in an elevator during a blackout, a college student spends the rest of the year trying to track down that girl to reunite with her, somewhere in the 100 person all girls dormitory. Wacky hijinks ensue as the protagonist tries to figure out who the girl could be.So far, so good. But the earnestness of the movie gets in the way. The protagonist himself is perhaps the most emasculated wimp ever recorded on videotape, prone to irritating (and wildly naive) speeches about male/female relationships that sound like the screenwriter didn't have anyone editing him -- or giving him a reality check.He's contrasted with an over-the-top boorish roommate, who's supposed to be some sort of hyper-masculine stereotype, but who mostly comes off as someone in need of serious therapy. His opinions come off as someone trying to recreate the beliefs of someone like radio personality Tom Leykis without actually having listened to someone like that, much less having extracted the points with actual relevance. Instead, he just reinforces the Alpha Wimp's saccharine platitudes. The fact that neither of them turns in a particularly good acting performance further hinders matters.The female characters (and actresses) almost salvage the film, and not just token ""big name"" Jamie Pressly. They gamely put forth a real effort to make a leaden script work, and pretend the wildly implausible situations aren't. But ultimately, they fail to elevate this above two stars (if they turned in a comparable job to the male leads, it would have been a single star film).A renter at best, and only if you've thoroughly exhausted every other teen movie possibility.",2,Tries too hard,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,1922,"['ironic', '100', 'Girls', 'guy', 'trying', 'hook', 'up', 'again', 'perfect', 'girl', 'flat', 'so', 'many', 'guys', 'just', 'too', 'hard.The', 'premise', 'cute', 'enough', 'certainly', 'no', 'less', 'plausible', 'most', 'teen', 'sex', 'movies', 'romantic', 'erotic', 'experience', 'elevator', 'blackout', 'college', 'student', 'rest', 'year', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'girl', 'reunite', 'somewhere', '100', 'person', 'girls', 'dormitory', 'Wacky', 'hijinks', 'ensue', 'protagonist', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'girl', 'could', 'be.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'earnestness', 'movie', 'way', 'protagonist', 'perhaps', 'most', 'emasculated', 'wimp', 'ever', 'recorded', 'videotape', 'prone', 'irritating', 'wildly', 'naive', 'speeches', 'male/female', 'relationships', 'sound', 'screenwriter', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anyone', 'editing', 'giving', 'reality', 'check.He', 'contrasted', 'over-the-top', 'boorish', 'roommate', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'sort', 'hyper-masculine', 'stereotype', 'who', 'mostly', 'off', 'someone', 'need', 'serious', 'therapy', 'opinions', 'come', 'off', 'someone', 'trying', 'recreate', 'beliefs', 'someone', 'radio', 'personality', 'Tom', 'Leykis', 'actually', 'having', 'listened', 'someone', 'much', 'less', 'having', 'extracted', 'points', 'actual', 'relevance', 'Instead', 'just', 'Alpha', 'Wimp', 'saccharine', 'platitudes', 'fact', 'particularly', 'good', 'acting', 'performance', 'further', 'hinders', 'matters.The', 'female', 'characters', 'almost', 'salvage', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'token', 'big', 'name', 'Jamie', 'Pressly', 'gamely', 'put', 'forth', 'real', 'effort', 'make', 'leaden', 'script', 'work', 'pretend', 'wildly', 'implausible', 'situations', 'are', ""n't"", 'ultimately', 'fail', 'elevate', 'two', 'stars', 'turned', 'comparable', 'job', 'male', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'single', 'star', 'film', 'renter', 'best', 'only', ""'ve"", 'thoroughly', 'exhausted', 'other', 'teen', 'movie', 'possibility']",N/A
666833,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005N89G,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","While slightly on the offensive side, the amount of swear words has been reduced to only a few occasions as the movie does a pretty good job maintaining an adventurous and hilarious storyline for most of its 80-plus minute running time.It's about a college boy who desires to find the girl who gave him a special romance on an elevator one night, so he goes on an investigation so to speak around the entire campus until he finds her.The name of the movie is misleading since the boy doesn't actually meet over 100 girls- he mostly sticks to 5 women each with their own distinct personality and attractive looks.  The ""100 girls"" aspect doesn't actually come into the picture until the very end of the movie.Without spoiling anything, viewers should have a fun time figuring out which girl ends up being with the boy.  The answer is sort of surprising I suppose, but then again, maybe not.  She receives just as much attention as the other girls as far as screen time is concerned.  I won't say another word!  I will say this- I guessed wrong.The boys roommate is a total dork who has an obsession with female body parts.  He also wishes to extend his own private area.Another aspect of the humor is that the boy dresses up as a girl and hangs out with other girls to try and find the mystery lady.  Not one of the stronger or funnier parts of the storyline for me personally, but decent enough.The humor is very good.  Everything from a competitive battle of table hockey with the one girl involving a game of the loser stripping nude, to the young man finding himself in a troubling situation with the obnoxious and phony boyfriend of another girl, the laughs and the surprises never stop.  This may be an older movie but, well, hey I graduated high school in 2000 and I'll be DARNED if I consider myself an old man!Overall, appropriate laughs, a storyline that actually does an intelligent job describing why we're attracted to women so strongly (that bullseye joke relating to nipples pretty much said it all- very creative) and a satisfying conclusion pretty much describes 100 Girls.",4,cute comedy romance,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,2089,"['slightly', 'offensive', 'side', 'amount', 'swear', 'words', 'been', 'reduced', 'only', 'few', 'occasions', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'adventurous', 'hilarious', 'storyline', 'most', '80-plus', 'minute', 'running', 'time.It', 'college', 'boy', 'who', 'find', 'girl', 'who', 'gave', 'special', 'romance', 'elevator', 'one', 'night', 'investigation', 'so', 'speak', 'entire', 'campus', 'her.The', 'name', 'movie', 'misleading', 'boy', ""n't"", 'actually', 'meet', '100', 'girls-', 'mostly', '5', 'women', 'own', 'distinct', 'personality', 'attractive', 'looks', '100', 'girls', 'aspect', ""n't"", 'actually', 'come', 'picture', 'very', 'end', 'movie.Without', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'viewers', 'should', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'girl', 'up', 'being', 'boy', 'answer', 'sort', 'surprising', 'suppose', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'not', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'other', 'girls', 'as', 'far', 'screen', 'time', 'concerned', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'will', 'say', 'this-', 'guessed', 'wrong.The', 'boys', 'roommate', 'total', 'dork', 'who', 'obsession', 'female', 'body', 'parts', 'also', 'extend', 'own', 'private', 'area.Another', 'aspect', 'humor', 'boy', 'up', 'girl', 'hangs', 'out', 'other', 'girls', 'try', 'find', 'mystery', 'lady', 'Not', 'one', 'stronger', 'funnier', 'parts', 'storyline', 'personally', 'decent', 'enough.The', 'humor', 'very', 'good', 'Everything', 'competitive', 'battle', 'table', 'hockey', 'one', 'girl', 'involving', 'game', 'loser', 'stripping', 'nude', 'young', 'man', 'finding', 'troubling', 'situation', 'obnoxious', 'phony', 'boyfriend', 'girl', 'laughs', 'surprises', 'never', 'stop', 'may', 'be', 'older', 'movie', 'well', 'hey', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', '2000', ""'ll"", 'be', 'DARNED', 'consider', 'old', 'man', 'Overall', 'appropriate', 'laughs', 'storyline', 'actually', 'intelligent', 'job', 'describing', 'why', ""'re"", 'attracted', 'women', 'so', 'strongly', 'bullseye', 'joke', 'relating', 'nipples', 'pretty', 'much', 'said', 'all-', 'very', 'creative', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'pretty', 'much', '100', 'Girls']",N/A

666838,AZCFS1OAU86YK,B00005N89G,C. Cloutier,"[0, 2]","I wanted to like this film, I really did.  The cast did a great job with the material they were given, but in the end, this film just wasn't good.  If the writer actually stuck to the premise of the film, it would have been a five-star film without question.  While the back-story premise is a boy who has to get to know the girls in order to find out which one he had his encounter with, we actually see very little of that.  Instead, the filmmakers decided to use the teen-tested Hollywood ploys of underwear, nudity, juvenile male ""humor"", and vulgar talk to try and wrangle the audience in.The film wasn't bad enough for me to stop it halfway through, but I was certainly tempted.  Basically, this film is a composite of four separate films:  a romantic comedy, a typical teen gross-out/vulgar comedy, a feminist activist film, and soft-core porn.The romantic comedy portion is entertaining and endearing, despite its flaws.  Basically, we have a boy who is (supposedly) socially inept with women.  A chance encounter in the dark allows him to connect with a girl (both socially (being able to actually speak with her) and physically), but he never sees who she is, and he spends the rest of the film trying to find her.  Unfortunately, we don't really see him getting to know the girls.  Sure, we see him spending a lot of time in their dorm, but too little time is spent with him actually learning about the girls and seeing the people behind the faces.The typical teen gross-out/vulgar comedy consumes most of the air time.  The vulgar sexual talk is what you would expect from a ""teen"" comedy, and as with most films, most of it serves no purpose other than the ""shock"" factor.  It seems to me like the writer used excessive vulgarity in an effort to be ""edgy"" or controversial.  I have no problem with vulgarity or sexuality, but when it doesn't add anything to the story, it's just annoying and actually detracts from the story.The feminist activist portion is, for me, the most annoying part of this film.  The main character's roommate is a typical male chauvinist, so the writer apparently felt that he needed to balance this by having the main character behave like a female chauvinist, telling us that women are superior to men.  Maybe I'm just irrationally level-headed and open-minded, but I don't want a film (or person) telling me that any group is superior to any other group.  Perhaps that was meant to be part of the comedy, but it certainly wasn't provided in a comedic context.The last portion of the composite is soft-core porn.  This starts with the opening scene in which we see the silhouette of a woman's breast, and the theme continuous throughout the film as we see multiple topless women for no reason at all.  There's the scene in which the actual porn film is playing on the television in the picture-in-picture while the main character's roommate is playing a video game, there's the scene in which a woman removes her top and bra in front of an open window (supposedly because the temperature was hot), only to put her top back on, and there's the ridiculous scene in which the woman who tans herself in her room decided to tan topless while the main character is sitting next to her (yet, when she was alone, she wore a top while tanning).  There may be other scenes that I've forgotten because they made no sense.  The only scene involving nudity which made any sense at all was the video the main character made of the ""ugly"" girl to show her that she really is beautiful.  While I don't think it was necessary to show her topless, it was a plausible reason for it (much like the topless scenes in American Beauty).  I'm also conflicted about the one sex scene in the film.  There was no nudity that I recall, but it certainly was very sexual.  I'm conflicted because I'm not sure it really added anything to the film.  It's almost as if it was written as part of a larger story arc that was never developed.In the end, this film simply did not live up to its potential.  With the cast and the story line, it could have been an amazing film, but the writer and filmmakers instead decided to use the standard Hollywood shock methods, resulting in a sub-par film which is barely entertaining.

When he wakes up alone the next morning, he vows to find his mysterious true love, no matter what it takes. The only problem is...he has no idea who she is! He must penetrate the ""virgin vault"" (a college dorm for women full of over 100 girls, each with the equal chance to turn out to be his true love) in order to find his mystery woman. Matt stumbles upon a diverse range of women and personalities in his quest, in addition to getting into a few pickles and learning more about himself and women.This film is hilarious and awesome. There aren't many well-known actors in it, but thats okay.  It still illustrates many poignant points about sex and the differences between men and women. I think that anyone who sees this film will end up laughing as well as nodding their head in silent agreement of the ideas and arguements put forth. You don't have to agree with everything, just sit back and enjoy the battle of the sexes!One of my favorite teachers once said: ""If you want people to listen to you, make them laugh. Then while their mouths are open just shove the truth in"". I think thats exactly what this movie does.

Or do you try to compare it on its own merits? There is a reason films like 100 GIRLS are destined to find their way into the refuse bin at blockbuster. They just don't work.That's not to say 100 GIRLS doesn't have merit. I think its heart is in the right place. It is attempting to take the old romantic comedy genre and turn it on its head. I'll bet there is even a better and yet unfilmable first draft of this film's screenplay out there somewhere, it would probably make a great read. Too bad it would never make a great movie.100 GIRLS follows a young man named Matt (Jonathan Tucker, The Virgin Suicides) on a quest to find the girl of his dreams. He's met her already, in the elevator of the girl's dorm during a blackout. They laughed, they talked, and they even had sex. Now he's fallen in love, but she won't show her face. So he sets out to find her. There are a hundred girls to chose from but you as an audience member wind up meeting five or six.The biggest problem is the tone of the movie. It's a literate drama destroyed by silly jokes. Matt pontificates (that's the only way I can explain it) likes Shakespeare and in the next the moment is acting like Charlie Chaplin. He'll say something completely sweet and good natured and then is called on to stand in front of a bunch of girls and scream `I want to full on kiss your Clitoris.' While the film intends it to be sentimental it's moments like that where you cringe.Plus it forces Matt to be really creepy. He digs through panty drawers, spends a decent amount of time dressed as a girl, and the only other guy (James DeBello, Swimfan) he hangs around with dangles weights from his penis. Are all these women blind? Because for some reason they seems to like him and even fall in love with him. If I had been a girl, I ask the most important question, why the hell does this guy get to spend all his time in the girl's dorm? I'd probably complain.You know what the biggest problem with Matt is he won't shut the hell up. I have a feeling if they told this story from the girls point of view they'd all be telling him to shut up. He's like that guy whom thinks he's so bright he forgets to listen to what's going on around him.As for the girls we meet its Emmanuelle Chriqui (Detroit Rock City) who is the most enchanting. She plays Patty the slut with so much more vulnerability than the part deserves. She's got these amazing eyes and this adorable persona. When she's not on the screen you long for her to be there. It's just too bad there are 99 other girls. I kind of wished the film were told from her perspective, it would have been an interesting glimpse.I do not recommend 100 Girls. But I don't hate it either. I'll bet writer/director Michael Davis (Eight Days A Week) had high hopes for this movie. There's a lot of hard work and love thrown into the picture. It's just too bad that the movie fails more times than it enchants.

Bernabo,"[12, 13]","When this movie showed up in this week's rentals I could not remember why it was on my list, and that was the case until Katharine Heigl showed up as one of the ""100 Girls"" promised by the title.  With Heigl positioned as the current queen of romantic comedy for recent hits such as ""Knocked Up"" and ""27 Dresses,"" I had added this 2000 film to connect some more of the dots in her film career.  My Introduction to Popular Culture class this semester got to choose between ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad,"" so I had just watched those movies again this last week to write up the quiz for the movie unit.  ""100 Girls"" is certainly in the tradition of such raunchy romantic comedies, a genre that I suppose has been around forever, but to my mind was given a cinematic rebirth that has been growing every since the release of ""Porky's.""  That being said, what we have here is one of the more charming examples of the form.The set up for the film from writer-director Michael Davis (""Eight Days a Week"") is that our boy Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is in the elevator at a girls dorm with a coed who is hidden behind a overflowing laundry basket when the power goes out.  The two of them connect interpersonally and then physically, but when he wakes up the next morning he is alone in the elevator.  So, Matthew has met his kismetic destiny but does not know her name.  However, he does know that she lives in that dorm and he is in possession of her panties.  Now all he needs to do is check out the panty drawers of all of the women in the dorm and he will find the woman he loves.Matthew is the sort of guy who has never gotten the girl, but is clearly going to finish ahead of Rod (James DeBello), his roommate who has has a one track mind on what he needs to do to impress the ladies. Our hero looks way better when stacked up against the nicotine gum chomping Crick (Johnny Green), who represents everything Matthew is not.  At least Matthew can articulate Crick's shortcomings, albeit in a grandiose manner that you may or may not deem to be excessive (but which at the very least will taunt all those of us who were bullied once upon a time with the thought of what might have been if we ever had the nerve to say such things to our tormentors).  Fortunately, in addition to finishing ahead of this particular competition by default, Matthew has a romantic soul and cerebral thesaurus that allows him to wax even more eloquently as part of the requisite grand gesture I insist guys have to justifying getting the girl before the end credits.The film makes a point of announcing the rest of the main cast members alphabetically so that you cannot automatically assume that the first female name on the list is she who is being sought.  The prime suspects are Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui), Arlene (Heigl), Wendy (Larisa Oleynik), Cynthia (Jaime Pressly), and Dora (Marissa Ribisi), and the chief charm of this film is that you can see how all of them could be the girl for Matthew and that he connects with all of them in significant ways.  This could have been one of those love 'em and leave 'em type films, but I really appreciated that Matthew did not do the wrong thing in trying to find the right girl.  I was right in figuring out which girl it was going to be, but that was not so much because of dazzling deductive reasoning working out the clues (e.g., Heigl's character is going to flunk the champagne class test), as it was wishful thinking because I knew who I thought it should be.Yes, there are some crude and totally gross parts in this movie and for a fair share of viewers I would not be surprised if those moments constitute two steps backwards that are not balanced off by an equal number of steps in a forward direction.  I had to shake my head over the gag with the ben-wa balls, but it was the bit with what was in the baggie that made me want to gag.  I am able to overlook such things in the end, but not everybody is going be that open minded, so watch ""100 Girls"" at your own risk.  Fortunately such humor is not the main thrust of this particular romantic comedy, and while it is most decidedly a relative proposition in this sub-genre, I found ""100 Girls"" to be rather charming and a pleasant surprise.",4,On my scales the charm comes out ahead of the raunchy stuff in this one,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,4224,"['When', 'movie', 'showed', 'up', 'week', 'rentals', 'could', 'not', 'remember', 'why', 'was', 'list', 'was', 'case', 'Katharine', 'Heigl', 'showed', 'up', 'one', '100', 'Girls', 'promised', 'title', 'Heigl', 'positioned', 'current', 'queen', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'recent', 'hits', 'such', 'Knocked', 'Up', '27', 'Dresses', 'had', 'added', '2000', 'film', 'connect', 'more', 'dots', 'film', 'career', 'Introduction', 'Popular', 'Culture', 'class', 'semester', 'got', 'choose', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Superbad', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'movies', 'again', 'last', 'week', 'write', 'up', 'quiz', 'movie', 'unit', '100', 'Girls', 'certainly', 'tradition', 'such', 'raunchy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'genre', 'suppose', 'been', 'forever', 'mind', 'was', 'given', 'cinematic', 'rebirth', 'been', 'growing', 'release', 'Porky', 'being', 'said', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'one', 'more', 'charming', 'examples', 'form.The', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Michael', 'Davis', 'Eight', 'Week', 'boy', 'Matthew', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'elevator', 'girls', 'dorm', 'coed', 'who', 'hidden', 'overflowing', 'laundry', 'basket', 'when', 'power', 'out', 'two', 'connect', 'interpersonally', 'then', 'physically', 'when', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'alone', 'elevator', 'So', 'Matthew', 'met', 'kismetic', 'destiny', 'not', 'know', 'name', 'However', 'know', 'dorm', 'possession', 'panties', 'Now', 'do', 'check', 'panty', 'drawers', 'women', 'dorm', 'will', 'find', 'woman', 'sort', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'gotten', 'girl', 'clearly', 'going', 'finish', 'ahead', 'Rod', 'James', 'DeBello', 'roommate', 'who', 'one', 'track', 'mind', 'what', 'do', 'impress', 'ladies', 'hero', 'way', 'better', 'when', 'stacked', 'up', 'nicotine', 'gum', 'chomping', 'Crick', 'Johnny', 'Green', 'who', 'everything', 'Matthew', 'not', 'least', 'Matthew', 'can', 'articulate', 'Crick', 'shortcomings', 'albeit', 'grandiose', 'manner', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'deem', 'be', 'excessive', 'very', 'least', 'will', 'taunt', 'who', 'were', 'bullied', 'once', 'time', 'thought', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ever', 'had', 'nerve', 'say', 'such', 'things', 'tormentors', 'Fortunately', 'addition', 'finishing', 'ahead', 'particular', 'competition', 'default', 'Matthew', 'romantic', 'soul', 'cerebral', 'thesaurus', 'wax', 'even', 'more', 'eloquently', 'part', 'requisite', 'grand', 'gesture', 'insist', 'guys', 'have', 'justifying', 'getting', 'girl', 'end', 'credits.The', 'film', 'point', 'announcing', 'rest', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'alphabetically', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'automatically', 'assume', 'first', 'female', 'name', 'list', 'who', 'being', 'sought', 'prime', 'suspects', 'are', 'Patty', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui', 'Arlene', 'Heigl', 'Wendy', 'Larisa', 'Oleynik', 'Cynthia', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'Dora', 'Marissa', 'Ribisi', 'chief', 'charm', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'girl', 'Matthew', 'significant', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'love', 'leave', ""'em"", 'type', 'films', 'really', 'appreciated', 'Matthew', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'wrong', 'thing', 'trying', 'find', 'right', 'girl', 'was', 'right', 'figuring', 'out', 'girl', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'dazzling', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'working', 'out', 'clues', 'e.g.', 'Heigl', 'character', 'going', 'flunk', 'champagne', 'class', 'test', 'was', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'knew', 'who', 'thought', 'should', 'be.Yes', 'are', 'crude', 'totally', 'gross', 'parts', 'movie', 'fair', 'share', 'viewers', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'moments', 'constitute', 'two', 'steps', 'backwards', 'are', 'not', 'balanced', 'off', 'equal', 'number', 'steps', 'forward', 'direction', 'had', 'shake', 'head', 'gag', 'ben-wa', 'balls', 'was', 'bit', 'what', 'was', 'baggie', 'made', 'want', 'gag', 'am', 'able', 'overlook', 'such', 'things', 'end', 'not', 'everybody', 'going', 'be', 'open', 'minded', 'so', 'watch', '100', 'Girls', 'own', 'risk', 'Fortunately', 'such', 'humor', 'not', 'main', 'thrust', 'particular', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'most', 'decidedly', 'relative', 'proposition', 'sub-genre', 'found', '100', 'Girls', 'be', 'rather', 'charming', 'pleasant', 'surprise']",N/A
