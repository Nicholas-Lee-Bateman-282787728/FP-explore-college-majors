This set is very good, but there are a few things that take the star off to make it 4 stars. Let me just start with the good things.The good things are that we have Michael Dorn (Worf on Star Trek Next Generation) narrating one of the DVDS, and with this there is Barry Taff. They also have real footage from the San Pedro haunting and some stuff about the Myrtle plantation. They also host with Christopher Lewis.Some bad stuff is the people they trust to do the show. There's a medium that puts a cork in a bowl of water, the cork having a needle in it. This is supposed to be used by a medium, the bowl having letters and numbers written around it like a Ouiji board. I believe in mediums, but that's just too much. Another thing is that they are showing real footage of a ghost opening a door, yet when something flies by they call it an orb when it is obviously a bug. It's shape, color, and movement is much like a bugs.Stuff like that. When all comes down to it, this is a very good series with only a few mishaps, but definitely worth a buy, and definitely worth these 4 stars.4/5John McAdam:Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?Am I Mad or Coherent?The Surgeon With GlassesConfucius Say",4,Pretty Good,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,1274,"['bought', '2-DVD', 'set', 'dad', 'Christmas', 'ROSS', 'Christmas', 'sale', 'set', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'take', 'star', 'make', '4', 'stars', 'Let', 'just', 'start', 'good', 'things.The', 'good', 'things', 'are', 'have', 'Michael', 'Dorn', 'Worf', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'narrating', 'one', 'DVDS', 'Barry', 'Taff', 'also', 'have', 'real', 'footage', 'San', 'Pedro', 'haunting', 'stuff', 'Myrtle', 'plantation', 'also', 'host', 'Christopher', 'Lewis.Some', 'bad', 'stuff', 'people', 'trust', 'do', 'show', 'medium', 'cork', 'bowl', 'water', 'cork', 'having', 'needle', 'supposed', 'be', 'used', 'medium', 'bowl', 'having', 'letters', 'numbers', 'written', 'Ouiji', 'board', 'believe', 'mediums', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'thing', 'are', 'showing', 'real', 'footage', 'ghost', 'opening', 'door', 'yet', 'when', 'something', 'flies', 'call', 'orb', 'when', 'obviously', 'bug', 'shape', 'color', 'movement', 'much', 'bugs.Stuff', 'When', 'down', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'only', 'few', 'mishaps', 'definitely', 'buy', 'definitely', 'worth', '4', 'stars.4/5John', 'McAdam', 'Were', 'Ancient', 'Gods', 'Other', 'Planets', 'Am', 'Mad', 'Coherent', 'Surgeon', 'GlassesConfucius', 'Say']",N/A

Old photo of Marilyn Monroe shown on screen as though she's a ghost.Los Luceros NM -  Instead of reenactments, they show stock footage from unknown old movies about wars between Americans and MexicansOlathe KS Naval Base:  Interviews with people who work thereMyrtles Plantation, LA:  Interviews with employeesWinchester House:  Interviews with tour guidesWaverly Mansion, MS:  Fell asleep, sorry!BIG LAUGH HERE:  One of the actual film crew members said a ghost put a rope around his neck and tried to hang him in the attic of one of these buildings.  To ""Prove"" it, they took a photo of him in the attic, supposedly hanging, with the rope around his neck.  WHY didn't they save him first?  He lived to tell the tale and show the actual rope for this filming.DISC 2 -  Titled ""Haunted Places,""  the actual Filmmaker, Christopher Lewis,  narrates this one and it gets funnier because he tells of his own ghost sightings and experiences.YMCA -  This is perhaps the one where we laughed the most.  A ghost-whisperer type with a bad wig tells us that the spirit of a ""conflicted ghost,""  haunts the place.  He was a member in the 50's and a closet Homosexual.  The ghost whisperer speaks to him and (I kid you not) leads the ghost to the light.  Then the ghost whisperer announces that he has gone into the light.Gettysburg - Interviews with more tour guides, people who are re-enactorsThere are lots of film clips of light blips going across the screen that they tell us are spirits.  If you go in a backyard in broad daylight I bet you'll film many of these light blips because they really are BUGS.This is NOT the quality of any other better Haunting program you've seen on the Travel Channel or History Channel.
