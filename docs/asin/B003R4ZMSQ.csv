Gammill,"[4, 5]","Some shows thrive not on the quality of their writing or production values, but on the strength of likable, dependable personalities in front of the camera.  Melissa & Joey is such a show.  Sure, WHO'S THE BOSS? already tackled the ""manny"" premise (although it was called ""housekeeper"" in the 80's), and mismatched couples have been the bread & butter of sitcoms since at least the 1960's.  But by casting two beloved t.v. stars (no coincidence, either, since Hart and Lawrence do double duty as executive producers), the show manages to rather easily hook viewers.Truth be told, I found the first 3 or so episodes to be very average.  But things start to pick up as the chemistry builds between the leads, and the relatively small supporting cast starts to find their own voices.  Melissa Joan Hart has been a gifted comic actress since her pre-teen Nickelodeon years, and it's to her credit than the somewhat edgy Mel Burke remains a thoroughly likable character.  Joey Lawrence, himself a 30+ year t.v. veteran, is solid as well, with a slightly more believable character with which to work.One word of caution: Don't be fooled by the ""ABC Family"" logo.  Melissa & Joey, while never really wallowing in gutter humor, can aim low with the best (or worst?) of them at times.  Still, for appropriate ages, it's as good as anything on network television at the moment.  Whether you consider that a compliment or not probably depends on how much t.v. you watch.  My wife and I watch quite a bit, and even though the show IS very familiar at times, it's still entertaining and fun to watch.  And really, does a sitcom need to do more than that?",4,"Hard to resist, even if it lacks originality",1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,1641,"['shows', 'thrive', 'not', 'quality', 'writing', 'production', 'values', 'strength', 'likable', 'dependable', 'personalities', 'front', 'camera', 'Melissa', 'Joey', 'such', 'show', 'Sure', 'WHO', 'BOSS', 'already', 'tackled', 'manny', 'premise', 'was', 'called', 'housekeeper', '80', 'mismatched', 'couples', 'have', 'been', 'bread', 'butter', 'sitcoms', 'least', '1960', 'casting', 'two', 'beloved', 't.v', 'stars', 'coincidence', 'either', 'Hart', 'Lawrence', 'do', 'double', 'duty', 'executive', 'producers', 'show', 'rather', 'easily', 'hook', 'viewers.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'found', 'first', '3', 'so', 'episodes', 'be', 'very', 'average', 'things', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'relatively', 'small', 'supporting', 'cast', 'starts', 'find', 'own', 'voices', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'been', 'gifted', 'comic', 'actress', 'pre-teen', 'Nickelodeon', 'years', 'credit', 'somewhat', 'edgy', 'Mel', 'Burke', 'thoroughly', 'likable', 'character', 'Joey', 'Lawrence', '30+', 'year', 't.v', 'veteran', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'slightly', 'more', 'believable', 'character', 'work.One', 'word', 'caution', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'ABC', 'Family', 'logo', 'Melissa', 'Joey', 'never', 'really', 'wallowing', 'gutter', 'humor', 'can', 'aim', 'low', 'best', 'worst', 'times', 'Still', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'network', 'television', 'moment', 'consider', 'compliment', 'not', 'probably', 'how', 'much', 't.v', 'watch', 'wife', 'watch', 'quite', 'bit', 'even', 'show', 'very', 'familiar', 'times', 'still', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'watch', 'really', 'sitcom', 'need', 'do', 'more']","Melissa & Joey: Season 1, Part One"

It seems that in each main show she has starred in; the target audience is of that age that she is during the show. Clarissa kids to tweens, Sabrina tweens to teens and M&J, well i don't wanna say adult but the show does focus around her and Joey moreover the children. Yes many jokes are more risque than other family ABC shows but this show should not be considered an ""adult"" show. After just a few episodes you immediately start thinking of Who's The Boss, and that idea is cemented when Mona herself makes an appearance on the show. Hart and Lawrence are great sitcom actors and the chemistry is definitely there. My favorite moment of this season was the Halloween ep where Ryder suggests to her aunt Mel to be a teenage witch and Mel replies, been there done that. I love it hahahahaha, us 17 year olds can feel nostalgia too!

I first watched her on Nickelodeon's ""Clarissa Explains It All"" and have since followed her career. (""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" still remains my favorite show to this day.) ""Melissa & Joey"", regardless of my admiration for Ms. Hart, is a smart, fresh, and modern comedy. Too many have commented that this series is a ""Who's the Boss?"" knock-off, but I disagree. While sharing a similar premise, this show is definitely one of a kind and has its own identity, as the characters are well-developed and are brought to life from such a wonderful cast. I have been hooked on ""Melissa & Joey"" since day one. While some may remember Hart and Lawrence from their childhood, this show is for a more mature audience than their previous series. For me, ""Melissa & Joey"" is just as good as my other favorites: ""Modern Family,"" ""The Big Bang Theory,"" ""The Middle"" & ""Rules of Engagement."" If you are a fan of any of these series, you will love ABC Family's hit comedy. Make sure to check out ""Season One, Part Two,"" which features the remaining eighteen episodes of the first season.

1360726,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B003R4ZMSQ,DVD Verdict,"[15, 16]","Appellate Judge Tom Becker, DVD Verdict -- ""Since it airs on ABC Family, I assumed Melissa & Joey would be a kid-centric sitcom along the lines of Full House or Boy Meets World. At the very least, since it seems a direct descendent (if not outright knock off) of Who's the Boss, I figured it would offer up a ""Will they or won't they?"" coupling along with sitcom-cute moppets and life-lesson moralizing at every turn. Imagine my surprise when Melissa & Joey instead turned out to be more interested in delivering laughs than homilies. Even though it features teenagers and a nontraditional family unit, this is not ""all ages"" television. Much of the humor skews adult and some jokes, while funny, are downright crude. It's not ""appointment TV"" (does that even exist anymore in the world of DVR?), but it's as good as, if not better than, many current network sitcoms, offering solid writing, some pretty funny jokes, and attractive and engaging leads. Shout! Factory has given us the first 12 episodes spread over two discs. Supplements include a blooper reel, ""featurettes"" that are actually family life-oriented questions posed to the stars, and a brief promo for the rest of the season.""",4,"An engaging, moppet-free little comedy with a decidedly grown-up slant",1303257600,"04 20, 2011",2011,1190,"['Appellate', 'Judge', 'Tom', 'Becker', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'ABC', 'Family', 'assumed', 'Melissa', 'Joey', 'would', 'be', 'kid-centric', 'sitcom', 'lines', 'Full', 'House', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'very', 'least', 'direct', 'descendent', 'not', 'outright', 'knock', 'off', 'Who', 'Boss', 'figured', 'would', 'offer', 'up', 'Will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'coupling', 'sitcom-cute', 'moppets', 'life-lesson', 'moralizing', 'turn', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'Melissa', 'Joey', 'instead', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'delivering', 'laughs', 'homilies', 'Even', 'teenagers', 'nontraditional', 'family', 'unit', 'not', 'ages', 'television', 'Much', 'humor', 'adult', 'jokes', 'funny', 'are', 'downright', 'crude', 'not', 'appointment', 'TV', 'even', 'exist', 'anymore', 'world', 'DVR', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'many', 'current', 'network', 'sitcoms', 'offering', 'solid', 'writing', 'pretty', 'funny', 'jokes', 'attractive', 'engaging', 'leads', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'given', 'first', '12', 'episodes', 'spread', 'two', 'discs', 'Supplements', 'include', 'blooper', 'reel', 'featurettes', 'are', 'actually', 'family', 'life-oriented', 'questions', 'posed', 'stars', 'brief', 'promo', 'rest', 'season']","Melissa & Joey: Season 1, Part One"
