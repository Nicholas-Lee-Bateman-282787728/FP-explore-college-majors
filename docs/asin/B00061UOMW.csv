Jon Voigt is an talanted actor but unfortunately doesn't have the massive body or work from his leading man years that one would hope which is why I picked up this movie. It is a quirky film certainly but doesn't really succeed either as a comedy or a drama. A movie worth watching but one that you probably won't watch again.,3,"OK, I guess",1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,454,"['never', 'saw', 'original', 'release', 'cut', 'film', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'film', 'decent', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'Jon', 'Voigt', 'talanted', 'actor', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'have', 'massive', 'body', 'work', 'leading', 'man', 'years', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'why', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'quirky', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'really', 'succeed', 'comedy', 'drama', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again']",Lookin' To Get Out!
855628,A1F1YLNOTUEHDG,B00061UOMW,"David A. Greene ""davidgreene52movie devotee""","[3, 4]","Jon Voigt described the initial theatrical release of ""Lookin to Get Out"" as a crippled version.  The studio had apparently demanded that Ashby's film be shortened by fifteen minutes.  He and many others involved with the film felt that it could not be made to work properly at that length.  I saw this version when it was first released with no notion of this problem.  I was actually rather shocked at the negative reaction it got from many critics.The most exciting thing about it, beside its unusual mix of comedy, suspense and drama, is the abundance of really intense, convincing acting by the principals as well as such supporting players as Bert Remsen and Richard Bradford.  One feels that the film not only comes close to the feeling of some of the best titles from Robert Altman, but often feels like some of the finer improvisational work in the films of John Cassavetes.  There is an overriding atmosphere of suspense as the characters flee from dangerous characters to whom their reckless gambling has placed them seriously in debt.  It is a comedy, but never a light, frothy, trivial one.I have wondered if perhaps the glitzy ""Vegas"" look of the opening credits sequence might have skewed the reviewers' preconception about the sort of picture they were seeing.  It has too often been the case that mistaken expectations about a film can severely distort one's perception of the whole thing.  Personally, I interpreted the opening as a visualization of that flashy casino world that loomed so large in the misguided dreams of the central characters.  As the story must progress through scenes of the characters' inner city street-level struggles for some time, before arriving at last in the gaudy glamor of Las Vegas, the opening also serves as a tasty hint of the more sumptuous production values to come.When I first saw the picture, I was so engrossed with its unusual edgy mix of comedy and dramatic tension, that its flaws did not stand out for me.  I am most eager to see the new extended edition, as I understand that it not only truly reflects the director's original intentions, but, on top of this, many of those involved in the production seem to feel so strongly that it is so much greater than the original theatrical release.  Perhaps those of us who were already tremendously taken with the film will find the alterations in this version very enlightening.  Clearly the film, as originally conceived was not, in the mind of its creators, properly represented by that first abridged edition.Some research has indicated to me that Amazon's listing of the  movie's format as 1.33:1 (full frame), fails to note that this DVD apparently features both a standard and a widescreen version.  As one who not only seeks always to see the director's shot compositions in the intended aspect ratio, but looks forward to large screen projection of movies to properly the true theatrical experience, I was much relieved to learn that the listing appears to have been an oversight.Based solely on my rich experience with the first release cut of ""Lookin' to Get Out"", I thoroughly recommend this picture to anyone seeking stylish, intriguing and refreshingly different film fare.",5,Stylish production frames a unique comedy,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,3195,"['Jon', 'Voigt', 'described', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Lookin', 'Get', 'Out', 'crippled', 'version', 'studio', 'had', 'apparently', 'demanded', 'Ashby', 'film', 'be', 'shortened', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'many', 'others', 'involved', 'film', 'felt', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'work', 'properly', 'length', 'saw', 'version', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'notion', 'problem', 'was', 'actually', 'rather', 'shocked', 'negative', 'reaction', 'got', 'many', 'critics.The', 'most', 'exciting', 'thing', 'beside', 'unusual', 'mix', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'drama', 'abundance', 'really', 'intense', 'convincing', 'acting', 'principals', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'supporting', 'players', 'Bert', 'Remsen', 'Richard', 'Bradford', 'One', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'close', 'feeling', 'best', 'titles', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'often', 'feels', 'finer', 'improvisational', 'work', 'films', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'overriding', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'characters', 'flee', 'dangerous', 'characters', 'whom', 'reckless', 'gambling', 'placed', 'seriously', 'debt', 'comedy', 'never', 'light', 'frothy', 'trivial', 'one.I', 'have', 'wondered', 'perhaps', 'glitzy', 'Vegas', 'look', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'might', 'have', 'skewed', 'reviewers', 'preconception', 'sort', 'picture', 'were', 'seeing', 'too', 'often', 'been', 'case', 'mistaken', 'expectations', 'film', 'can', 'severely', 'distort', 'one', 'perception', 'whole', 'thing', 'Personally', 'interpreted', 'opening', 'visualization', 'flashy', 'casino', 'world', 'loomed', 'so', 'large', 'misguided', 'dreams', 'central', 'characters', 'story', 'must', 'progress', 'scenes', 'characters', 'inner', 'city', 'street-level', 'struggles', 'time', 'arriving', 'last', 'gaudy', 'glamor', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'opening', 'also', 'tasty', 'hint', 'more', 'sumptuous', 'production', 'values', 'come.When', 'first', 'saw', 'picture', 'was', 'so', 'engrossed', 'unusual', 'edgy', 'mix', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'flaws', 'did', 'not', 'stand', 'out', 'am', 'most', 'eager', 'see', 'new', 'extended', 'edition', 'understand', 'not', 'only', 'truly', 'director', 'original', 'intentions', 'top', 'many', 'involved', 'production', 'seem', 'feel', 'so', 'strongly', 'so', 'much', 'greater', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Perhaps', 'who', 'were', 'already', 'tremendously', 'taken', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'alterations', 'version', 'very', 'enlightening', 'Clearly', 'film', 'originally', 'conceived', 'was', 'not', 'mind', 'creators', 'properly', 'represented', 'first', 'abridged', 'edition.Some', 'research', 'indicated', 'Amazon', 'listing', 'movie', 'format', '1.33:1', 'full', 'frame', 'note', 'DVD', 'apparently', 'standard', 'widescreen', 'version', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'always', 'see', 'director', 'shot', 'compositions', 'intended', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'forward', 'large', 'screen', 'projection', 'movies', 'properly', 'true', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'was', 'much', 'relieved', 'learn', 'listing', 'have', 'been', 'oversight.Based', 'solely', 'rich', 'experience', 'first', 'release', 'cut', 'Lookin', 'Get', 'Out', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'picture', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'stylish', 'intriguing', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'film', 'fare']",Lookin' To Get Out!

""Heaven's Gate"" in it's untruncated version is a pretty good flick.  ""Howard the Duck"" is okay and not worthy of the brickbats it received from the critics.  The recently re-issued ""Revolution"" where director Hugh Hudson cut scenes is alright but really not worthy of a reappraisal.  As for this misunderstood gem it's good, not great, but an enjoyable viewing experience for what it is.  The only real flaw I found was in the script, co-written by star Jon Voight, which suffers from fleeting incoherence and meandering.  That said, the film is blessed with expert direction by the late Hal Ashby who keeps the proceedings interesting.  Voight and co-star Burt Young make likable two characters that are essentially pathetic sad sacks.  Ann-Margret's presence, even in forgettable dreck like the ""Grumpy Old Men"" flicks, always elevates the projects she appears in.

I liked the diversity of character here, between the old waiter they got to gamble for them, the hotel owner 'Bernie Goldman', whose presence added just the right amount of weight, and of course the 3 main stars.

855631,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00061UOMW,Kevin Killian,"[9, 10]","I read Nick Dawson's biography of Hal Ashby and admired the young Scottish biographer's attempt to make sense out of the mad rush of US life in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.  What a challenge, and in the book he announces that he has uncovered, with the help of Ashby's daughter, Ashby's own cut of LOOKIN TO GET OUT in the UCLA film archives.  He made the movie sound so good I pre-ordered the thing on Amazon and counted the days till it appeared.  So this is all your fault, Mr. Dawson!  In this case, I'm terribly grateful, because I too had heard the stories of how awful GET OUT was and if you hadn't been so persuasive I wouldn't have given the picture a first chance, much less a second.We watched it on New Years Day, and it was a good way to begin what I hope will be a much better year than last year.  Ashby's direction is topnotch and from the beginning he establishes a mood and atmosphere that carries the movie in a rather different direction than the Vegas Vacation sort of caper movie I had written it off as.  The movie is like something Robert Altman might have made in his heyday, and Jon Voight and Burt Young excel as hardcore loser gamblers who can't keep a twenty dollar bill in their wallets.  In their Morningside Heights apartment life is so squalid that we were reminded forcible of Voight and Dustin Hoffman in Midnight Cowboy.  In fact the whole movie is like Midnight Cowboy + The Sting, is you can picture that.  Then they have to go to Las Vegas; this part of the setup seemed awfully forced but once they got to the MGM Grand, the movie starts to improve in innumerable ways.For one thing Ann-Margret's there, and she used to be involved with Voight way back when (six years ago) and we hear she has a five year old daughter, and I'm a sucker for any movie that makes me do the math of pregnancy.  Patricia (Ann-Margret) is being kept by the manager of the hotel, slick Bernie Gold, and again based on the average caper movie you wouldn't think you would like this character but the actor, and the writing, makes him strangely sympathetic.  I would have liked a whole movie based on this guy, he's a real cool cat.Speaking of cool cats we get tiny glimpses not only of Angelina Jolie, but of Siegfried and Roy!  Very eerie!  Anyhow if you like the old, slapdash, ragged narratives that Ashby (and a packl of other talented US directors) used to present us in the golden age of the New American Cinema, get ready for another fantastic addition to that list of great pictures.
