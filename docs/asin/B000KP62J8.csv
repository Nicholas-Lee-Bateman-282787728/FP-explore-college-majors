Guy Pearce who plays Rob McGregor was busy filming a movie, so a young unknown named Hugh Jackman was written onto the series for five episodes, who happens to take a shine to Rob's so-called girlfriend.The Episodes are:ComebackThe Grand OpeningBlack SheepEven thought I would prefer a complete season release instead of a handful of episodes, I still enjoyed the DVD as I only paid five dollars for it.",5,Hugh Jackman's Short Run on the Series,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,573,"['Here', 'three', 'episode', 'release', 'Snow', 'River', 'McGregor', 'Saga', 'western', 'filmed', 'Australia', 'aired', 'USA', 'former', 'Family', 'Channel', 'aka', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'Rob', 'McGregor', 'was', 'busy', 'filming', 'movie', 'young', 'unknown', 'named', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'was', 'written', 'series', 'five', 'episodes', 'who', 'take', 'shine', 'Rob', 'so-called', 'girlfriend.The', 'Episodes', 'are', 'ComebackThe', 'Grand', 'OpeningBlack', 'SheepEven', 'thought', 'would', 'prefer', 'complete', 'season', 'release', 'instead', 'handful', 'episodes', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'only', 'paid', 'five', 'dollars']",Snowy River: The McGregor Saga

1035473,A1TKM36EYEQNSM,B000KP62J8,Joseph J. Slevin,"[2, 2]","I repeat what others say that there should be more episodes of this series available.  Here you have three episodes that feature Hugh Jackman before his rise through X-Men and Swordfish and Australia.You have the McGregor clan living where you were left off with the Snowy River movies, children, dad is getting older, though not any less vigorous.  Jackman comes back home after years away.  He is a friend of the family so, he is not fully tied in with them.  You can get caught up pretty fast with the first episode, Comeback, because Jackman is told about the whole McGregor clan and what they are doing.In The Grand Opening, we have the family pitching in to help someone in their community while facing a trial of their own.  In Black Sheep, you will see two stories in one, both very interesting with their own message.If the rest of the series was like this, it would be interesting to find the whole series available on DVD eventually.  Maybe one or another station will air these shows some time creating a market for them.  As already mentioned, Guy Pearce (The Time Machine) does not appear in any of the three episodes.Great action, good story line, morals to the story and morals being mentioned and even taught.  TV in the USA needs more like these to give people a choice.",5,Snowy River Revisited - The Story Continues - Modern Day Bonaza,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,1288,"['repeat', 'what', 'others', 'say', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'episodes', 'series', 'available', 'Here', 'have', 'three', 'episodes', 'feature', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'rise', 'X-Men', 'Swordfish', 'Australia.You', 'have', 'McGregor', 'clan', 'living', 'where', 'were', 'left', 'off', 'Snowy', 'River', 'movies', 'children', 'dad', 'getting', 'older', 'not', 'less', 'vigorous', 'Jackman', 'back', 'home', 'years', 'away', 'friend', 'family', 'so', 'not', 'fully', 'tied', 'can', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'pretty', 'fast', 'first', 'episode', 'Comeback', 'Jackman', 'told', 'whole', 'McGregor', 'clan', 'what', 'are', 'doing.In', 'Grand', 'Opening', 'have', 'family', 'pitching', 'help', 'someone', 'community', 'facing', 'trial', 'own', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'will', 'see', 'two', 'stories', 'one', 'very', 'interesting', 'own', 'message.If', 'rest', 'series', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'find', 'whole', 'series', 'available', 'DVD', 'eventually', 'Maybe', 'one', 'station', 'will', 'air', 'shows', 'time', 'creating', 'market', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Time', 'Machine', 'not', 'appear', 'three', 'episodes.Great', 'action', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'morals', 'story', 'morals', 'being', 'mentioned', 'even', 'taught', 'TV', 'USA', 'more', 'give', 'people', 'choice']",Snowy River: The McGregor Saga
