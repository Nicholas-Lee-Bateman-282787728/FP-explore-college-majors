704178,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0000687F5,C. O. DeRiemer,"[19, 19]","""A gorgeously filmed study of homosexual lust"" wrote one reviewer, and dumber words by a film critic have yet to be written. Taboo is a meditative study, broken by bouts of intense but not flashy sword combat, of what happens when a disruptive element enters the closed, hyper-macho world of a military unit.It's Kyoto in 1865. The old social and economic order imposed on Japan by the Tokugawa shogunate is slowly atrophying. The Shunsen-gumi is an elite samurai unit, one of several, whose job it is to maintain order for the shogun. Recruitment has been difficult, and now candidates are accepted, after rigorous trials, from the merchant class. The troop is ruled by rigid hierarchy, a code of conduct which is unforgiving and a demand for loyalty which cannot be questioned. The troop's captain is Toshizo Hijikata (Beat Takeshi); his lieutenant is Soji Okita (Shinji Takeda).Sozaburo Kano (Ryuhei Matsuda) is the 18-year-old son of a wealthy merchant whose family at one time had been samurai. He proves to be an outstanding candidate in sword combat and is accepted, along with one other, Hyozo Tashiro (Tadanobu Asano). Kano is, no other word will do, beautiful, with a pale, oval face, limpid eyes and full, cupid lips. He is not effeminate, but he is a feminine dream some men will lust for. He also is without apparent emotion. He perhaps is aware of the effect he has, and he is passive in the face of the sexual tension he creates. Passion among men in the military is as old, or older, as the Egyptian charioteers, the Greek hoplites, down to modern armies. The samurai accepted this as a fact of life, something without consequence as long as discipline, order and duty prevail. Kano's feminine beauty and his passivity create tensions among this cloistered group of warriors, who have no wars to fight. This leads to ambiguous actions, assumptions and death.The film serves as a cool commentary on the relationships among these men, from the two samurai who profess their love directly to Kano and implore him to let them have him, to Beat Takeshi's Captain Hijikata, who is wise and a little bemused by Kano. Hijikata may not, as he puts it, ""be that way,"" but he finds that he and the other officers are a little more gentle with Kano than they might be with others. Kano himself, in most regards, does not react to those who want him carnally. When he allows himself to be used once, he might as well have been in another room for all the response he gives. If he doesn't react to others' lust, neither does he seem moved by killing or death. Ordered to behead in a ritual execution a samurai who broke the code of behavior, Kano does so without hesitation and as efficiently as if he were butchering a pig.What motivates Kano? We are never sure. At the end of the movie, when Kano is ordered by his superiors to fight and kill the fellow samurai who has been judged a murderer, we find ourselves with doubts, just as Captain Hijikata realizes he has doubts. Perhaps it's as simple as the answer Kano gave to an officer who asked him, ""Why does a rich man's son join the militia?"" Kano answered, ""To have the right to kill.""Beat Takeshi does an excellent job as the captain of the troop. He brings a subtle glimpse of comedy now and then to the role, but now and then also a questioning look at Kano. As Takeshi Kitano he has written and directed any number of hard-boiled, macho yakuza movies. His casting is effective and unusual. Roger Ebert wrote, ""Imagine John Wayne in ""Red River,"" with a stirring beneath his chaps every time he looks at Montgomery Clift."" This a great image but it doesn't convey the subtleties of the situation. The movie wouldn't work, however, without Ryuhei Matsuda. He looks at times like an Utamaro print. What is surprising is that he was just 15 when Nagisa Oshima cast him in the the part; it was his first acting role.Oshima, who directed that other beautiful and perverse movie, In the Realm of the Senses, has created a film which is elegant and a feast for the eye. It sets it's own, deliberate pace. It's wonderfully photographed, whether in winter or in spring, whether in the streets of Kyoto or in the barracks of the troop. This may not be a movie for everyone, but if you approach it with an open mind -- and not as a ""gorgeously filmed study of homosexual lust"" -- I think you'll be rewarded.The DVD picture is excellent.

704179,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,B0000687F5,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[18, 27]","Feudal Japan--Leaders of the Shinsengumi militia, an indpendent ""bad cop"" faction on the government's side, watch as their two newest recruits face off in a Kendo match--a wooden sword battle during a time when swordmasters received the highest regard, the samurai period. Bearded Tashiro faces off against Sozaburo Kano, who everyone can see is easily the better swordsman. But to the surprise of many, except a few insightful higher-ups, Kano loses. Beat Takeshi's Hijikata character (one of many real Japanese personalities--the Shinsengumi stories alone could entertain you for hours) and Isami Kondo immediately understand, what is going on. The viewer doesn't, but soon will. A thoughtful, judgemental look at Sozaburo, with his boyish face and demeanor, long, smooth hair, and feminine almond-shaped eyes--got it yet?--reveals all. He lost because he may be ""involved"" with Tashiro, who may not be the only one with ""leanings"" toward Sozaburo.It's an interesting revelation to those of us only familiar with the tough samurais of Kurosawa films or the Zatoichi blind swordsman-type TV series; that these men of the sword were also men of a different type of sword. The practice isn't uncommon in history. Gladiators (yes, those during Russell Crowe's Maximus character's time) were also prone to have homosexual leanings, as did many senators. But director Nagisa Oshima does a masterful job of the consequences of a workplace relationship in the context of samurai Japan, and a homosexual relationship at that.Not to say that the practice is widely accepted. Hijikata even orders a sergeant to take Sozaburo to a brothel to see if he can be turned around; Sozaburo misinterprets the sergeant's friendliness. Internal strife develops as other samurais join the chase for Sozaburo; rumor gives birth to tension that ends in murders, a difficult thing to have in an organization involved in a war. This is particularly of concern to Hijikata, who serves as the narrative voice in many parts of the movie, although Sozaburo remains the protagonist.Oshima has a flair for creating then sustaining moods, be it soft, dark and suspenseful, or symbolically poignant. The swordfights are excellent, as they should be, being that this is a samurai film. Blood and gore levels are kept a reasonably tame level for this sort of film. This film would be best viewed with some sort of knowledge of the time period; perhaps get some simple reading done, or even watch a few episodes of the Rurouni Kenshin anime series, which deals heavily with the Shinsengumi, Ishin Shishi and the Meiji restoration of this time (search for ""Samurai X"" then watch the Trust and Betrayal movies).This is a four-star film that gets three for revealing an aspect of the samurai that many hardcore fans may not be comfortable with. It may taint your ideal of the samurai, but Oshima allows us to accept this slowly, through a beautifully--both in image and in flow--worked film. Highly recommended for viewing, and possibly recommended for your own library.",3,Shocking Swordplay,1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,3031,"['Feudal', 'Japan', 'Leaders', 'Shinsengumi', 'militia', 'indpendent', 'bad', 'cop', 'faction', 'government', 'side', 'watch', 'two', 'newest', 'recruits', 'face', 'off', 'Kendo', 'match', 'wooden', 'sword', 'battle', 'time', 'when', 'swordmasters', 'received', 'highest', 'regard', 'samurai', 'period', 'Bearded', 'Tashiro', 'off', 'Sozaburo', 'Kano', 'who', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'easily', 'better', 'swordsman', 'surprise', 'many', 'few', 'insightful', 'higher-ups', 'Kano', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'Hijikata', 'character', 'one', 'many', 'real', 'Japanese', 'personalities', 'Shinsengumi', 'stories', 'alone', 'could', 'entertain', 'hours', 'Isami', 'Kondo', 'immediately', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'soon', 'will', 'thoughtful', 'judgemental', 'look', 'Sozaburo', 'boyish', 'face', 'demeanor', 'long', 'smooth', 'hair', 'feminine', 'almond-shaped', 'eyes', 'got', 'yet', 'lost', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'Tashiro', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'leanings', 'Sozaburo.It', 'interesting', 'revelation', 'only', 'familiar', 'tough', 'samurais', 'Kurosawa', 'films', 'Zatoichi', 'swordsman-type', 'TV', 'series', 'men', 'sword', 'were', 'also', 'men', 'different', 'type', 'sword', 'practice', ""n't"", 'uncommon', 'history', 'Gladiators', 'yes', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Maximus', 'character', 'time', 'were', 'also', 'prone', 'have', 'homosexual', 'leanings', 'did', 'many', 'senators', 'director', 'Nagisa', 'Oshima', 'masterful', 'job', 'consequences', 'workplace', 'relationship', 'context', 'samurai', 'Japan', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'that.Not', 'say', 'practice', 'widely', 'accepted', 'Hijikata', 'even', 'orders', 'sergeant', 'take', 'Sozaburo', 'brothel', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'Sozaburo', 'sergeant', 'friendliness', 'Internal', 'strife', 'develops', 'other', 'samurais', 'join', 'chase', 'Sozaburo', 'rumor', 'birth', 'tension', 'murders', 'difficult', 'thing', 'have', 'organization', 'involved', 'war', 'particularly', 'concern', 'Hijikata', 'who', 'narrative', 'voice', 'many', 'parts', 'movie', 'Sozaburo', 'protagonist.Oshima', 'flair', 'creating', 'then', 'sustaining', 'moods', 'be', 'soft', 'dark', 'suspenseful', 'symbolically', 'poignant', 'swordfights', 'are', 'excellent', 'should', 'be', 'being', 'samurai', 'film', 'Blood', 'gore', 'levels', 'are', 'kept', 'reasonably', 'tame', 'level', 'sort', 'film', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'viewed', 'sort', 'knowledge', 'time', 'period', 'perhaps', 'get', 'simple', 'reading', 'done', 'even', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'anime', 'series', 'heavily', 'Shinsengumi', 'Ishin', 'Shishi', 'Meiji', 'restoration', 'time', 'search', 'Samurai', 'X', 'then', 'watch', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'movies', '.This', 'four-star', 'film', 'three', 'revealing', 'aspect', 'samurai', 'many', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'comfortable', 'may', 'taint', 'ideal', 'samurai', 'Oshima', 'accept', 'slowly', 'beautifully', 'image', 'flow', 'worked', 'film', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'possibly', 'recommended', 'own', 'library']",Taboo
704180,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0000687F5,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[4, 5]","The year 1865 was a time of transition for Japan.  The Tokugawa Shogunate would collapse in two years time and the Meiji Restoration, where the emperor would be restored to his full glory was a year after that.  Yet political struggles and fighting between those loyal to the shogun and those loyal to the emperor marked that interim period.The black-robed Shinsengumi are a pro-shogunate, pro-isolationist police force, a kind of elite squad fighting against pro-imperialist forces in Kyoto.  They are led by Commander Kondo Isami and Captain Hijikata Toshizo.The story revolves around Sozaburo Kano, one of two new recruits whose fighting skills impress the two leaders.  Kano seems very able even in his first assignment, the execution of someone who broke the Shinsengumi code of borrowing money, dispatching the offender in the traditional way.  Yet his effeminate looks and his hair, still in a long pony-tail as opposed to the short-cut adult style, arouse desires in certain officers in the police force, such as his fellow recruit Hyozo Tashiro and threatens the stability of the Shinsengumi.  While Kano denies that he is someone's lover, he seems to enjoy the attention he gets from the others.  Hijikata seems to think Kano and Toshiro were lovers.  He has a dojo bout against Kano, who stands up well, and against Tashiro, who is ""one notch lower than Kano.""  Yet when Kano and Tashiro fight, the former does not fight as well.  This inconsistency leads the captain to that conclusion in answer to rumours asking who Kano has taken up with.One repeated line has the motif of ""Does he lean that way"" or ""I didn't know he leant that way"" in regards to officers suspected of desiring Kano.  There was indeed a homosexual subculture flourishing in Kyoto during the Tokugawa period and it wasn't forbidden.  In the Shinsengumi, though, it's akin to love of youthful male beauty in Roman times.One thing that might confuse people is the repeated mention of the Ikedaya Jiken (Incident). That was a fight that took place at the Ikedaya, an inn in Kyoto, in July 1864.  Commander Kondo and some men attacked and killed eight anti-shogunate activists, arresting twenty.  The two samurai who taunt Kano while he is having a bout with Commander Inoue were suspected of being anti-shogunate activists itching for revenge.  And Satsuma and Aizu refers to domains held under sway of more moderate anti-shogunate forces who sought reconciliation with the shogunate.Beat Takeshi (Takeshi Kitano under his acting name) is his usual understated but occasionally potent self, and he does well as Hijikata, even if real Hijikata died in his mid-thirties.  His observation that jealousy among men is a dangerous thing underscores what happens when Kano comes into their midst.  Historical accuracy is also questionable in the characterization of Commander Kondo, who like Hijikata was in his thirties when he was later captured and executed in 1868 by imperial forces.The period detail is well captured, down to the dress and even the palanquins, as is the militaristic dojo atmosphere of the Shinsengumi. An interesting study of the attractions to youthful beauty and the jealousies it can lead to.",4,A natural or unnatural yearning?,1061856000,"08 26, 2003",2003,3191,"['year', '1865', 'was', 'time', 'transition', 'Japan', 'Tokugawa', 'Shogunate', 'would', 'collapse', 'two', 'years', 'time', 'Meiji', 'Restoration', 'where', 'emperor', 'would', 'be', 'restored', 'full', 'glory', 'was', 'year', 'political', 'struggles', 'fighting', 'loyal', 'shogun', 'loyal', 'emperor', 'marked', 'interim', 'period.The', 'black-robed', 'Shinsengumi', 'are', 'pro-shogunate', 'pro-isolationist', 'police', 'force', 'kind', 'elite', 'squad', 'fighting', 'pro-imperialist', 'forces', 'Kyoto', 'are', 'led', 'Commander', 'Kondo', 'Isami', 'Captain', 'Hijikata', 'Toshizo.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Sozaburo', 'Kano', 'one', 'two', 'new', 'recruits', 'fighting', 'skills', 'impress', 'two', 'leaders', 'Kano', 'very', 'able', 'even', 'first', 'assignment', 'execution', 'someone', 'who', 'broke', 'Shinsengumi', 'code', 'borrowing', 'money', 'dispatching', 'offender', 'traditional', 'way', 'effeminate', 'looks', 'hair', 'still', 'long', 'pony-tail', 'opposed', 'short-cut', 'adult', 'style', 'arouse', 'desires', 'certain', 'officers', 'police', 'force', 'such', 'fellow', 'recruit', 'Hyozo', 'Tashiro', 'stability', 'Shinsengumi', 'Kano', 'someone', 'lover', 'enjoy', 'attention', 'others', 'Hijikata', 'think', 'Kano', 'Toshiro', 'were', 'lovers', 'dojo', 'bout', 'Kano', 'who', 'up', 'well', 'Tashiro', 'who', 'one', 'notch', 'lower', 'Kano', 'when', 'Kano', 'Tashiro', 'fight', 'former', 'not', 'fight', 'as', 'well', 'inconsistency', 'captain', 'conclusion', 'answer', 'rumours', 'asking', 'who', 'Kano', 'taken', 'up', 'with.One', 'repeated', 'line', 'motif', 'Does', 'lean', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'leant', 'way', 'regards', 'officers', 'suspected', 'desiring', 'Kano', 'was', 'indeed', 'homosexual', 'subculture', 'flourishing', 'Kyoto', 'Tokugawa', 'period', 'was', ""n't"", 'forbidden', 'Shinsengumi', 'though', 'akin', 'love', 'youthful', 'male', 'beauty', 'Roman', 'times.One', 'thing', 'might', 'confuse', 'people', 'repeated', 'mention', 'Ikedaya', 'Jiken', 'Incident', 'was', 'fight', 'took', 'place', 'Ikedaya', 'inn', 'Kyoto', 'July', '1864', 'Commander', 'Kondo', 'men', 'attacked', 'killed', 'eight', 'anti-shogunate', 'activists', 'arresting', 'twenty', 'two', 'samurai', 'who', 'taunt', 'Kano', 'having', 'bout', 'Commander', 'Inoue', 'were', 'suspected', 'being', 'anti-shogunate', 'activists', 'itching', 'revenge', 'Satsuma', 'Aizu', 'refers', 'domains', 'held', 'sway', 'more', 'moderate', 'anti-shogunate', 'forces', 'who', 'sought', 'reconciliation', 'shogunate.Beat', 'Takeshi', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'acting', 'name', 'usual', 'understated', 'occasionally', 'potent', 'self', 'well', 'Hijikata', 'even', 'real', 'Hijikata', 'died', 'mid-thirties', 'observation', 'jealousy', 'men', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'what', 'when', 'Kano', 'midst', 'Historical', 'accuracy', 'also', 'questionable', 'characterization', 'Commander', 'Kondo', 'who', 'Hijikata', 'was', 'thirties', 'when', 'was', 'later', 'captured', 'executed', '1868', 'imperial', 'forces.The', 'period', 'detail', 'well', 'captured', 'down', 'dress', 'even', 'palanquins', 'militaristic', 'dojo', 'atmosphere', 'Shinsengumi', 'interesting', 'study', 'attractions', 'youthful', 'beauty', 'jealousies', 'can', 'lead']",Taboo

However, it could be interesting if some previous ""clues"" are known.1) Homoerotic relationships were accepted in Japan. It was until the 2nd half of 19th century, when Japan wanted to be cope with Western Culture, that these relationships vanished from public records.2) Homoerotic relationships followed a cultural and social code, were ranking of those involved -lover, loved and their lord- were as important as the ways to offer your love to another man. Even hairdoes were related to roles (young pages used long locks and were loved-ones, grown-ups used adult hairdoes and were lovers, in the erastes-eromenos model, similar to Greeks). This film is based in that.3) This film becomes a thriller, as main characters are breaking those rules and some murderers are planned, around a same-sex lovers couple.4) To understand last scene, we must remember that poetic figure to describe someone beautiful and good is to compare her/him with a cherry blossom.

The elegant portrayal of the stringently disciplined, tough environment of a 19th century samurai dojo is deceptive. Beneath the surface of this  ritualistic environment, seething passions roil. This movie has to contain one of the most beautiful people I've seen. Ryhei Matsuda as the young samurai Sozaburo Kano is exquisitely beautiful and this makes the jealousies and competitiveness he arouses in the souls of some of his fellow samurais believable. Matsuda's acting skills are superb: he perfectly captures the chilling lust for power and killing in the young samurai, all the more shocking because he is the passive partner in his homosexual liaisons. The costumes and settings, the dazzling swordfights and the tightly contained passions breaking loose add up to an engrossing film.Why then the 3* rating? The English sub-titles were poor. They were small and were displayed in a flash, too often leaving me (a fast reader) only only half-read the words. Whether it was becase I missed clues given in the too-fast sub-titles, or because I don't have a deep enough knowledge of the historical period to fully appreciate nuances and customs, there were times when some of the plot twists were a bit obscure for my taste.But this movie is worth seeing for the acting alone; whether restrained or unfettered, the fraught emotions of all the samurai were palpable and leapt off the screen.",3,Elegantly deceptive,1303257600,"04 20, 2011",2011,1447,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', '3*', 'rating', 'suggests', 'elegant', 'portrayal', 'stringently', 'disciplined', 'tough', 'environment', '19th', 'century', 'samurai', 'dojo', 'deceptive', 'surface', 'ritualistic', 'environment', 'seething', 'passions', 'roil', 'movie', 'contain', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'people', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ryhei', 'Matsuda', 'young', 'samurai', 'Sozaburo', 'Kano', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful', 'jealousies', 'competitiveness', 'souls', 'fellow', 'samurais', 'believable', 'Matsuda', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'superb', 'perfectly', 'chilling', 'lust', 'power', 'killing', 'young', 'samurai', 'more', 'shocking', 'passive', 'partner', 'homosexual', 'liaisons', 'costumes', 'settings', 'dazzling', 'swordfights', 'tightly', 'contained', 'passions', 'breaking', 'loose', 'add', 'up', 'engrossing', 'film.Why', 'then', '3*', 'rating', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'were', 'poor', 'were', 'small', 'were', 'displayed', 'flash', 'too', 'often', 'leaving', 'fast', 'reader', 'only', 'only', 'half-read', 'words', 'was', 'becase', 'missed', 'clues', 'given', 'too-fast', 'sub-titles', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'deep', 'enough', 'knowledge', 'historical', 'period', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'nuances', 'customs', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'bit', 'obscure', 'taste.But', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'acting', 'alone', 'restrained', 'unfettered', 'fraught', 'emotions', 'samurai', 'were', 'palpable', 'leapt', 'off', 'screen']",Taboo

Takeshi Kitano headlines proceedings as an experienced militia leader who fears Matsuda's influence on the men in his command, despite the boy's obvious fighting prowess. However, some viewers may be disconcerted by Matsuda's overtly feminised appearance, which makes him look odd rather than beautiful, undermining the film's entire premise. In fact, Matsuda is upstaged in this regard by actor/musician Shinji Takeda (PULSE), playing an equally beautiful fellow warrior whose smile and enthusiasm lights up the entire garrison, prompting a violent sequence of events during the narrative's latter stages.Though the film's 'gay' element is presented matter-of-factly, Oshima also highlights a measure of prejudice amongst Matsuda's fellow soldiers, with devastating consequences for many of the leading characters. Staged and photographed with formal grace (a typical chanbara conceit), Oshima's busy screenplay - co-written with Ryotaro Shiba, derived from fact-based literary works - moves swiftly from sex-drama to murder-mystery with lightning efficiency, and the climactic twist is genuinely surprising.",2,Odd but engaging samurai drama,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,1512,"['GOHATTO', 'TABOO', 'Japan/France/UK', '1999', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtracks', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '/', 'DTS1865', 'beautiful', 'young', 'male', 'warrior', 'Ryohei', 'Matsuda', 'jealousy', 'resentment', 'members', 'samurai', 'garrison', 'leading', 'conflict', 'murder.Nagisa', 'Oshima', 'courted', 'controversy', 'unusual', 'drama', 'foreground', 'homoerotic', 'underpinnings', 'chanbara', 'swordplay', 'epics', 'Takeshi', 'Kitano', 'headlines', 'proceedings', 'experienced', 'militia', 'leader', 'who', 'Matsuda', 'influence', 'men', 'command', 'boy', 'obvious', 'fighting', 'prowess', 'However', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'disconcerted', 'Matsuda', 'overtly', 'feminised', 'appearance', 'look', 'rather', 'beautiful', 'undermining', 'film', 'entire', 'premise', 'fact', 'Matsuda', 'upstaged', 'regard', 'actor/musician', 'Shinji', 'Takeda', 'PULSE', 'playing', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'fellow', 'warrior', 'smile', 'enthusiasm', 'lights', 'up', 'entire', 'garrison', 'prompting', 'violent', 'sequence', 'events', 'narrative', 'latter', 'film', ""'gay"", 'element', 'presented', 'matter-of-factly', 'Oshima', 'also', 'measure', 'prejudice', 'amongst', 'Matsuda', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'many', 'leading', 'characters', 'Staged', 'photographed', 'formal', 'grace', 'typical', 'chanbara', 'conceit', 'Oshima', 'busy', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Ryotaro', 'Shiba', 'derived', 'fact-based', 'literary', 'works', 'moves', 'swiftly', 'sex-drama', 'murder-mystery', 'lightning', 'efficiency', 'climactic', 'twist', 'genuinely', 'surprising']",Taboo

But the Shinsengumi Samurai Militia are still attempting to uphold tradition. Things go reasonably well until Sozaburo Kano (Izo's Ryuhei Matsuda in his film debut), an immensely talented fighter who also happens to be as beautiful as a geisha, is invited to join the militia. An alarming number of the samurai begin courting him, which concerns Captain Hijikata (Beat Takeshi), the militia's second in command. As if that's not annoying enough, a band of roustabouts who still hold a grudge from a battle last year are back in town attacking the militia whenever possible.Oshima, well-known for stripping and examining social and sexual norms, does the same thing here. The problem is, it's pretty much all he does; the film's plot is coherent at best, and it's not often at its best. While most of the actors here give decent performances, they can only work with what they've got, and Beat Takeshi's closing monologue may be the least satisfying thing I've ever seen him do. When the big subplot surfaces, Oshima could have run with it and turned this into a great psycho-sexual serial killer film, but it's almost as if Oshima (or the editor of the film, depending) saw the big mystery as incidental at best, and left huge parts of it on the cutting-room floor. Everything moves towards the big climax... and the big climax never comes. We just get Takeshi's closing statements (and, to be fair, a beautiful closing shot).A very pretty film, but an unsatisfying one. **",2,"Mediocre film, bad ending.",1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,1583,"['Taboo', 'Nagisa', 'Oshima', '1999', 'Japan', '1856', 'Samurai', 'are', 'way', 'Japan', 'going', 'changes', 'Shinsengumi', 'Samurai', 'Militia', 'are', 'still', 'attempting', 'uphold', 'tradition', 'Things', 'go', 'reasonably', 'well', 'Sozaburo', 'Kano', 'Izo', 'Ryuhei', 'Matsuda', 'film', 'debut', 'immensely', 'talented', 'fighter', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'as', 'beautiful', 'geisha', 'invited', 'join', 'militia', 'alarming', 'number', 'samurai', 'begin', 'courting', 'Captain', 'Hijikata', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'militia', 'second', 'command', 'not', 'annoying', 'enough', 'band', 'roustabouts', 'who', 'still', 'hold', 'grudge', 'battle', 'last', 'year', 'are', 'back', 'town', 'attacking', 'militia', 'whenever', 'possible.Oshima', 'well-known', 'stripping', 'examining', 'social', 'sexual', 'norms', 'same', 'thing', 'here', 'problem', 'pretty', 'much', 'film', 'plot', 'coherent', 'best', 'not', 'often', 'best', 'most', 'actors', 'here', 'give', 'decent', 'performances', 'can', 'only', 'work', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'closing', 'monologue', 'may', 'be', 'least', 'satisfying', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', 'When', 'big', 'subplot', 'surfaces', 'Oshima', 'could', 'have', 'run', 'turned', 'great', 'psycho-sexual', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'almost', 'Oshima', 'editor', 'film', 'depending', 'saw', 'big', 'mystery', 'incidental', 'best', 'left', 'huge', 'parts', 'cutting-room', 'floor', 'Everything', 'moves', 'big', 'climax', 'big', 'climax', 'never', 'just', 'get', 'Takeshi', 'closing', 'statements', 'be', 'fair', 'beautiful', 'closing', 'shot', 'very', 'pretty', 'film', 'unsatisfying', 'one', '**']",Taboo
