Even the film's blurb tells you the the makers have little of no understanding of the subject they are talking about, and that this clearly is not an unbiased and reasoned film about the subject. Atheism is not a belief. It is the opposite of belief. Atheism has nothing to do with faith in the religious sense. Most of us don't believe that trees are the most intelligent life form on this planet, but if someone changes their mind and starts to believe that maybe trees are the most intellgent life form, then have they ""lost their faith"" in not believing that trees are the most intelligent. And the film looks like it was made by a bunch of junior high school kids. Not only is this film poorly made in every respect but it also reveals a very immature and spectacularly narrow worldview on the part of the film makers. Plenty of religious people become atheists every year, hell even every week. But you don't see genuine atheists suddenly becoming 'believers' anymore than you see grown, sane people suddenly developing a devout belief in leprechauns and unicorns.",1,What absolute nonsense.

Film is an easy way to get non-believers to at least take some time to watch and listen and, hopefully, then start thinking about God's existence.

Technology holds our interest while God, or a higher power, and other humans slip through our fingers.  It is not shocking to learn that a non-believer changes their view, what is surprising is that it is genuine.  There are numerous instances of chance meetings, but the intensity of the experience is much more and that unfolds seamlessly throughout the action.
