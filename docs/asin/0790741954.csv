The ending is laughable, unfortunately. I could only recommend this movie for the completists, as It Is kind of boring sometimes. If you are really into werewolves, go for An American werewolf in London, or even The Howling (The special effects are pretty poor sometimes, contrasting with some brilliant moments). If you are NOT into werewolves movies you'll also find this review helpful as It makes you give It a try. The bottom line is, I wouldn't want to be fooled purchasing or renting a film which boasts a werewolf on the cover that has nothing to do with the real plotand It Is nowhere to be seen.

109505,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,0790741954,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[0, 0]","1981 was a great year for werewolf movies. There was the excellent An American Werewold in London by John Landis and Joe Dante's equally creepy The Howling. To finish off the trifecta of werewolf films for the year there's Michael Wadleigh's Wolfen. Wadleigh's film was a very good werewolf tale that added abit of Native American folklore to the typical lycanthrope story, but it's slightly overlong running time keeps it from being as great as Landis' and Dante' contributions.Wolfen takes place in the city of New York and its growing urban jungle of decaying and condemned buildings in the city's ghettoes. One has to remember that the late 70's and through on the mid-80's the inner-cities of most of the major metropolitan ctieis in the US have turned into rundown ghettoes rife with drug problems, high-crime rates and unemployment. It is in this setting that Wolfen takes place in. The film used the screenplay co-written by horror veteran novelist Whitley Strieber and Strieber's quirky style heavily influences this werewolf story. Strieber's screenplay mixes together a police procedural, political intrigue, business corruption, race and class relations, Native American lycanthrope folklore and horror. Wolfen tries to combine all these different elements together as well as possible and it mostly succeeds, but there's times when the film gets dragged down abit trying to accomplish this.The cast is made up of mostly new actors (well young and new at that time) with a few veteran actors holding things together. Albert Finney gets the choice role of NYPD Detective Dewey Wilson who begins investigating a series of brutal murders of three individuals whose race, class and personal status brings no discernable clues that ties them together. Joining him in his investigation --- which Wilson gradually suspects has some sort of supernatural angle to it --- were the very young Diane Venora  and Gregory Hines. Edward James Olmos plays a Native American whose knowledge of ties to who or what was involved in the killings might be closer than everyone thinks. The performances from all involved were pretty good though Hines comic relief performance was abit too blackface in its tone and execution. 1981 Hollywood was still not ready to discount such racial stereotypes and it gives Wolfen a certain sense of creepiness and insensitivity. Maybe the screenplay was written just that way to highlight one of the film's themes of racial and class inequality. If it was then Strieber sure did an excellent job of hammering home the point.The film has very creepy moments whenever the story switches over to be told through the viewpoint of the wolfen. The skewed perspective the camera takes on to signify that we were seeing things through the eyes of the wolfen was disorienting and creepily well-done. Wolfen never really has pure horror moments in the film though in the hands of a director like Carpenter, Hooper, Craven or Cunningham. Wadleigh does a good enough job, but it seemed like he was treating the horror aspect of the story with less attention than it was its due.Wolfen marks the weakest of the werewolf trilogy of 1981, but thats not to say that it was a bad film. The finished product was a well-done film and its attempt to be very ambitious in its storytelling has to be commended. The fact that the filmmakers and all involved were able to keep all the different themes and genres together without having the film spiral into utter confusion makes it a worthwhile werewolf film.",4,"Very good take on the werewolf story, albeit one that goes abit too long",1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,3513,"['1981', 'was', 'great', 'year', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'was', 'excellent', 'American', 'Werewold', 'London', 'John', 'Landis', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'equally', 'Howling', 'finish', 'off', 'trifecta', 'werewolf', 'films', 'year', 'Michael', 'Wadleigh', 'Wolfen', 'Wadleigh', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'werewolf', 'tale', 'added', 'abit', 'Native', 'American', 'folklore', 'typical', 'lycanthrope', 'story', 'slightly', 'overlong', 'running', 'time', 'being', 'as', 'great', 'Landis', 'Dante', 'contributions.Wolfen', 'place', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'growing', 'urban', 'jungle', 'decaying', 'condemned', 'buildings', 'city', 'ghettoes', 'One', 'remember', 'late', '70', 'mid-80', 'inner-cities', 'most', 'major', 'metropolitan', 'ctieis', 'US', 'have', 'turned', 'rundown', 'ghettoes', 'rife', 'drug', 'problems', 'high-crime', 'rates', 'unemployment', 'setting', 'Wolfen', 'place', 'film', 'used', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'horror', 'veteran', 'novelist', 'Whitley', 'Strieber', 'Strieber', 'quirky', 'style', 'heavily', 'werewolf', 'story', 'Strieber', 'screenplay', 'together', 'police', 'procedural', 'political', 'intrigue', 'business', 'corruption', 'race', 'class', 'relations', 'Native', 'American', 'lycanthrope', 'folklore', 'horror', 'Wolfen', 'combine', 'different', 'elements', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'possible', 'mostly', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'dragged', 'down', 'abit', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'this.The', 'cast', 'made', 'mostly', 'new', 'actors', 'well', 'young', 'new', 'time', 'few', 'veteran', 'actors', 'holding', 'things', 'together', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'choice', 'role', 'NYPD', 'Detective', 'Dewey', 'Wilson', 'who', 'investigating', 'series', 'brutal', 'murders', 'three', 'individuals', 'race', 'class', 'personal', 'status', 'discernable', 'clues', 'together', 'Joining', 'investigation', 'Wilson', 'gradually', 'sort', 'supernatural', 'angle', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'Diane', 'Venora', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Native', 'American', 'knowledge', 'ties', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'involved', 'killings', 'might', 'be', 'closer', 'everyone', 'thinks', 'performances', 'involved', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Hines', 'comic', 'relief', 'performance', 'was', 'abit', 'too', 'blackface', 'tone', 'execution', '1981', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'still', 'not', 'ready', 'discount', 'such', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'Wolfen', 'certain', 'sense', 'creepiness', 'insensitivity', 'Maybe', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'just', 'way', 'highlight', 'one', 'film', 'themes', 'racial', 'class', 'inequality', 'was', 'then', 'Strieber', 'sure', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'hammering', 'home', 'point.The', 'film', 'very', 'creepy', 'moments', 'whenever', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'viewpoint', 'wolfen', 'skewed', 'perspective', 'camera', 'signify', 'were', 'seeing', 'things', 'eyes', 'wolfen', 'was', 'disorienting', 'creepily', 'well-done', 'Wolfen', 'never', 'really', 'pure', 'horror', 'moments', 'film', 'hands', 'director', 'Carpenter', 'Hooper', 'Craven', 'Cunningham', 'Wadleigh', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'seemed', 'was', 'treating', 'horror', 'aspect', 'story', 'less', 'attention', 'was', 'due.Wolfen', 'weakest', 'werewolf', 'trilogy', '1981', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'film', 'finished', 'product', 'was', 'well-done', 'film', 'attempt', 'be', 'very', 'ambitious', 'storytelling', 'be', 'commended', 'fact', 'filmmakers', 'involved', 'were', 'able', 'keep', 'different', 'themes', 'genres', 'together', 'having', 'film', 'spiral', 'utter', 'confusion', 'worthwhile', 'werewolf', 'film']",N/A

109509,A1YWUPCT83WY48,0790741954,"Claude Avary ""West Coast Reader""","[22, 26]","1981 was &quot;The Great Werewolf Year,&quot; when three major films heralded a revival of the legendary monster. &quot;The Howling&quot; and &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; have both become classics, while the third, &quot;Wolfen,&quot; remains an oddity. It is definitely the strangest of the three and makes unusual changes to the werewolf mythology to the point that it might not be about werewolves at all. The usual standards of the genre -- silver bullets, wolfsbane, transformations, curses -- are nowhere to be seen, although there are hints of spiritual powers and cunning intelligence beyond the natural world.  And while &quot;American Werewolf in London&quot; and &quot;The Howling&quot; contained extensive comedy and many genre-references along with their horror, &quot;Wolfen&quot; plays its story straight and dead serious. It has social issues mixed into its thrills 'n' chills premise: a police detective (Albert Finney) investigating murders in New York City that point toward a wolf-like killer, or possibly a whole pack of them.  Director Michael Wadleigh (his only other film is the classic concert documentary &quot;Woodstock&quot;) uses the horror movie backdrop as a venue for commentary on class, environmentalism, industrialization, and Native American politics.This is an ambitious bill to fill, and &quot;Wolfen&quot; doesn't quite manage to pull it off. You can appreciate Wadleigh's goals, but he often trips over trying to do too much. The political grandstanding makes for a thoughtful horror movie, but it also slows the film down and overbalances it. Sometimes, you just want action and scares, and &quot;Wolfen&quot; frequently drags.  It would have rocked at ninety-minutes, but at nearly two hours, it goes on for too long. The open moves rapidly, and the ending delivers the right amount of apocalyptic violence you expect, but in the center the spaces between the wolf attacks start feeling longer and longer.Some of various elements never fit together, and a few plot points just left on the ground. The mystery surrounding the creatures is, however, appropriate -- sometimes it's better for a horror film to avoid spelling out everything for you.Where &quot;Wolfen&quot; works best is in Wadleigh's superb visual style and the realistic performances. The use of a polarization effect and a steadicam to represent the wolves' POV is quite stunning and eerie. Wadleigh also expertly films New York City and its run-down slums. The film absolutely breathes with a battered, decayed atmosphere. Wadleigh really goes all out with unusual visua; approaches, and it gives the film a polished and inventive feel. Albert Finney and Diane Venora are both good in their roles; Finney especially projects a wonderful world-weariness that matches the setting around him. The film thankfully doesn't load him down with excess psychological baggage. We don't need to have his troubles explained to us; we can SEE them in the world in which he lives. Edward James Olmos is also memorable as a Native American who draws Finney's suspicions early in the movie. Gregory Hines, however, is too exaggerated in his semi-comic role (the only comedy in the film) of the coroner working with Finney. The movie also has an excellent early score from James Horner (composer of &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;).The DVD has an extremely good transfer, which is surprising considering the film's age. The print looks almost pristine and is gorgeously formatted in widescreen. Warner Bros. usually doesn't put this much effort into back catalog movies like this. The Dolby Surround Stereo is adequate (I occasionally noticed some synch problems) and a bit low in volume. The extras are skimpy: the trailer, a page listing the cast and crew, and a few screens of text on the history of werewolf movies. (An earlier edition advertised audio commentary on the back of the snap case, but this was a misprint.)&quot;Wolfen&quot; is worth a look for horror fans, or people who want some social commentary and intelligence with their thrills. If you can make it through the slower sections, you'll find it a rewarding viewing experience.",3,"Intriguing political horror movie, but short on scares",1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,4164,"['1981', 'was', 'quot', 'Great', 'Werewolf', 'Year', 'quot', 'when', 'three', 'major', 'films', 'heralded', 'revival', 'legendary', 'monster', 'quot', 'Howling', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'quot', 'have', 'become', 'classics', 'third', 'quot', 'Wolfen', 'quot', 'oddity', 'definitely', 'strangest', 'three', 'unusual', 'changes', 'werewolf', 'mythology', 'point', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'werewolves', 'usual', 'standards', 'genre', 'silver', 'bullets', 'wolfsbane', 'transformations', 'curses', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'are', 'hints', 'spiritual', 'powers', 'cunning', 'intelligence', 'natural', 'world', 'quot', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'quot', 'quot', 'Howling', 'quot', 'contained', 'extensive', 'comedy', 'many', 'genre-references', 'horror', 'quot', 'Wolfen', 'quot', 'story', 'straight', 'dead', 'serious', 'social', 'issues', 'mixed', 'thrills', 'n', 'chills', 'premise', 'police', 'detective', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'investigating', 'murders', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'point', 'wolf-like', 'killer', 'possibly', 'whole', 'pack', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Wadleigh', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'classic', 'concert', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Woodstock', 'quot', 'horror', 'movie', 'backdrop', 'venue', 'commentary', 'class', 'environmentalism', 'industrialization', 'Native', 'American', 'politics.This', 'ambitious', 'bill', 'fill', 'quot', 'Wolfen', 'quot', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Wadleigh', 'goals', 'often', 'over', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'political', 'grandstanding', 'thoughtful', 'horror', 'movie', 'also', 'film', 'down', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'want', 'action', 'scares', 'quot', 'Wolfen', 'quot', 'frequently', 'would', 'have', 'rocked', 'ninety-minutes', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'too', 'long', 'open', 'moves', 'rapidly', 'ending', 'delivers', 'right', 'amount', 'apocalyptic', 'violence', 'expect', 'center', 'spaces', 'wolf', 'attacks', 'start', 'feeling', 'longer', 'longer.Some', 'various', 'elements', 'never', 'fit', 'together', 'few', 'plot', 'points', 'just', 'left', 'ground', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'creatures', 'however', 'appropriate', 'better', 'horror', 'film', 'avoid', 'spelling', 'out', 'everything', 'you.Where', 'quot', 'Wolfen', 'quot', 'best', 'Wadleigh', 'superb', 'visual', 'style', 'realistic', 'performances', 'use', 'polarization', 'effect', 'steadicam', 'represent', 'wolves', 'POV', 'quite', 'stunning', 'eerie', 'Wadleigh', 'also', 'expertly', 'films', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'run-down', 'slums', 'film', 'absolutely', 'battered', 'decayed', 'atmosphere', 'Wadleigh', 'really', 'unusual', 'visua', 'approaches', 'film', 'polished', 'inventive', 'feel', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Diane', 'Venora', 'are', 'good', 'roles', 'Finney', 'especially', 'projects', 'wonderful', 'world-weariness', 'setting', 'around', 'film', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'load', 'down', 'excess', 'psychological', 'baggage', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'troubles', 'explained', 'can', 'SEE', 'world', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'also', 'memorable', 'Native', 'American', 'who', 'Finney', 'suspicions', 'early', 'movie', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'however', 'too', 'exaggerated', 'semi-comic', 'role', 'only', 'comedy', 'film', 'coroner', 'working', 'Finney', 'movie', 'also', 'excellent', 'early', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'composer', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'quot', 'Aliens', 'quot', '.The', 'DVD', 'extremely', 'good', 'transfer', 'surprising', 'considering', 'film', 'age', 'print', 'almost', 'pristine', 'gorgeously', 'formatted', 'widescreen', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'usually', ""n't"", 'put', 'much', 'effort', 'back', 'catalog', 'movies', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'Stereo', 'adequate', 'occasionally', 'noticed', 'synch', 'problems', 'bit', 'low', 'volume', 'extras', 'are', 'skimpy', 'trailer', 'page', 'listing', 'cast', 'crew', 'few', 'screens', 'text', 'history', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'earlier', 'edition', 'advertised', 'audio', 'commentary', 'back', 'snap', 'case', 'was', 'misprint', 'quot', 'Wolfen', 'quot', 'look', 'horror', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'social', 'commentary', 'intelligence', 'thrills', 'can', 'make', 'slower', 'sections', ""'ll"", 'find', 'rewarding', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

You'll be happy to know that by the movie's end, they pay back the grudge---with interest.I saw a snippet of ""Wolfen"" when I was a child, and it terrified me and dominated my dreams for weeks thereafter. I dreamed I was outside the ruined church in the Bronx slums that features so prominently in the film, that I was crawling over mounds of garbage and trying to find my parents, and that I was being watched. There were eyes, merciless, hungry eyes, fixed on me from the surrounding ruined tenements and the derelict, haunted cathedral.Imagine my surprise years later when I learned that Wadleigh incorporates this attitude of lurking, haunted menace, this watchful malevolence, into his fine film about lycanthropy. Having discovered ""Wolfen"", for years it was incorporated into my Halloween film-viewing ritual; even now it retains the ability to terrify, disturb, and awe.Wadleigh's tale centers on an aging NYPD detective (played marvellously by Albert Finney) called in to investigate the savage murder and dismemberment of real estate tycoon Christopher Van der Veer, his wife, and his chauffeur. Van der Veer had been planning a redevelopment in the ruined, devastated South Bronx, and Finney's investigation---aided by policeman Whittington (played with reserve by Gregory Hines)---brings him face to furry face with an ancient horror that pits itself against a sprawling, modern City. Oh, did I mention that this ancient horror has an appetite?Wadleigh and cinematographer Gerry Fisher have an uncanny talent for capturing bleak, dessicated, haunted sites on film, and ""Wolfen"" winds itself around fairly elaborate set pieces: the Battery massacre sequence, the ruined Cathedral and slum in the South Bronx, the Van der Veer skyscraper, love interest Diane Venora's apartment, the besieged lab in the Central Park Zoo, a cable on the Brooklyn Bridge high above New York Harbor.These stylish sets are aided and abetted by fine acting: Finney as the dogged police inspector, Venora as the steely love interest, Hines as the loyal partner, Edward James Olmos as the cynical Native American who knows too many secrets. There is a wonderful scene between Olmos and Finney on the Brooklyn Bridge which Olmos digs into with sadistic glee, and it makes the movie.There are some other fine directorial touches on display here, particularly Wadleigh's spooky wolf-cam and wolf-vision: the stalking of a pitiful homeless man in the beasts' lair is one of the most terrifying put to film. Wadleigh provides a nice counterpoint to the wolf-cam with the green starlight scope-vision of Hines's M-16 sniper rifle, underscoring the battle---and similarities---between modern Man and his ageless Enemy.This is not a film about special effects: there are no gaudy, gory transformation sequences here, and the film doesn't need them. This is quiet, mounting, full-bodied horror, though, and Wadleigh does a fine job in creating a sense of unease and malevolence, particularly in the sequence where Finney confronts some of the Native American construction workers in a Manhattan bar. The scene manages to convey malevolence, dignity, and sadness all at once, and is marvelous.""Wolfen"" is a movie that, for me, is all about Fear, about Fear Incarnate, about ageless Monsters forced to fight for their territory.

If you figure it out, drop me a line.Anyway, let's begin this review by examining the title. Wolfen is a combination of the noun ""wolf"" + the suffix ""-en."" The ""-en"" part means ""to increase the quality of."" So, what we have here is an ""increase"" of a ""wolf"" or to put it another way, more wolf than a regular wolf. This comparison will become obvious to you when you see the second half of the film.The next thing I want to discuss is Albert Finney. What was the casting director thinking? Finney has a repertoire of two facial expressions when it comes to conveying emotions in this movie. And that hair! It looked like he had the latest in weaving for that time. Ah . . . what's the use.There is an upside to this film, however. After seeing this movie again, I'm truly convinced that the director for the Predator, John McTiernan, must've been influenced by the wolf effects in this movie. I say this because whenever the camera switches from ""human view"" to the ""wolf view,"" the heat detecting sound and color scheme looks almost the same as the one used by the Predator itself. It could be a coincidence but . . .In the end, it had potential. The premise is original though and that's the only reason it got two stars from me. And, if you're looking for a scary werewolf creature, you're going to be sadly disappointed.

If you like the tone of movies like the Shining, Howling, etc, then this one will catch your interest.  I won't say it's as good as either of those movies, but there's a familiar late 70s vibe in Wolfen which came out in '81.  The cinematography is eerie, high quality and artisic.  At nearly 2 hours (114 mins) it's moody meandering drags occasionally.  But viewers are rewarded with some splendid shots of the city (from atop the Brooklyn bridge, demolition lots in the Bronx, surreal wolfen POV shots etc.), putting it's erie 'Exorcist'-like spell over a now decades old New York (evidence World Trade Center).I went into this more excited than I came out of it.  It's premise is obviously far-flung and probably worked better in the book (which I didn't read).  The Wolfen are creatures that ride that line between Native American symbol and Cujo (a great movie I might add) - which could be one of things that weaken the film.  We're not sure how exactly to feel about these carnivores 'ridding the pack of the weak and sick'.The actors carry the piece well though the main detective is a bit stodgy which helps slow the pace, but overall the acting fits and helps create the mood.  As the plot really unfolds however, things got a little less intriguing for me, although I'll give 'em this much - they did a lot with the semi-wacky idea they were running on.  I guess that's the supernatural for you.  I'm happy I saw it.  Halfway through the picture I'd have given it 5 stars.  By the end I was down to 4 as it didn't reach the excitement level, or cleverness, of classics like The Shining or Exorcist.  I wouldn't watch it again, but I'm happy to have seen it once.

It produced three masterpieces of the sub-genre, ""An American Werewolf In London,"" ""The Howling, & ""Wolfen."" Of these three, ""Wolfen"" is the odd movie out, or the dark horse, if you will. It's strays far from the traditional lycanthropy film. Some might even question if it's a true werewolf film. I myself, have asked that question, but the answer is yes, for a lack of a better classification to stick this film into.Wealthy business man, his wife, & his bodyguard are brutally murdered at night in a NYC park. The police are at a loss to figure out just what happened. The feds are brought in, & they suspect terrorist. Albert Finney as the world weary police detective, ""Dewey Wilson,"" is on the case. He finds strange hairs on the victims, analyzed by an zoologist, who finds them to be wolf hairs. Dewey at first finds this ridiculous, wolves in NYC! Then he stumbles on to vagrants, junkies, & the unwanted, disappearing at an alarming rate in NYC. People that nobody cares about. People who have literally slipped through the cracks of the system & disappeared. They all seem to be disappearing from the same area, a run down part of NYC, slated to be demolished & revitalized. The area it's self exudes dread with it's ghostly abandoned buildings, looming menacingly as if hiding horrors untold. So our story begins.""Wolfen"" is as serious of a horror film as a deer running for it's life from a pack of wolves. The dreadful atmosphere is so thick with foreboding that you could shovel your way through it. Other than Gregory Hines hilariously wisecracking coroner, that helps Finney figure out the puzzle, this is a very somber film. It crackles tension! A particularly potent creepy scene, is where Finney goes into a bar where American natives hang out. He has questions. The answers he receives makes you skin gooseflesh. This scene is just amazing, it could've of been a disaster, but the great acting, dreary surrounding, & cinematography make it mind blowing! But it's the events that lead up to it, that really build a solid foundation of dread at it's scalp tingling finest, as Finney is terrified at what he suspects, comes true. There are other blood pulsing scenes in this film! An abandoned church scene where Finney & his female colleague, the beautiful Diane Venora, who is part of an anti terrorist team, hear a baby cry at the top of a winding stair case. They proceed up & your fists clinch, your imagination runs wild with anticipation. Baby's crying have always been a great source of dread in horror films when done right, & this one is perfect! The film starting scene with the Mayor of NYC, is another hair raiser!""Wolfen"" really uses cinematography, & special sound effects to get at you with tremendous effect! It is also of note that this film uses the first POV camera in cinema, shot in the perspective of the creatures point of view, like night vision detecting heat sources. The sound was also from the creatures viewpoint in these scenes, which also was a new technique. The effects are unsettling to say the least, as the camera & sound keep switching from the creatures perspective to it's prey, humans. You're just waiting for the carnage to begin! The soundtrack is incredible, for it hugs this film in it's every twist & turn like a constrictor squeezing it's prey. The amount of added atmospheric dread it brings is invaluable to this film's success!If there is fault with this film, it would be the ending, depending on your point of view. I myself was totally engulfed by this film in the theatre, but the ending kind of knocked it down for me. Today I'm of different opinion, the ending is quite suitable, let alone surprising! It complimented the film's theme perfectly. Also of note, the director of this film was none other than Michael Wadleigh, whose only other film before was ""Woodstock!""If you've not seen this film & have some time, check it out, it's an obscure treasure, totally overshadowed by the two other lycanthrope films of 1981, but worthy every bit as much. If you've only seen it once, & didn't like the ending, see it again, with an open mind. You may just find out this is not only one of the best werewolf type movies ever committed to film, but one of the greatest horror films of the 80's, & believe me, there is a lot of competition!",5,Hair Raising Horror With A Message!,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,4416,"['5', 'Stars', '=', 'MasterpieceAs', ""'ve"", 'wrote', 'two', 'other', 'reviews', '1981', 'was', 'year', 'wolf', 'Werewolf', 'produced', 'three', 'masterpieces', 'sub-genre', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Howling', 'Wolfen', 'three', 'Wolfen', 'odd', 'movie', 'out', 'dark', 'horse', 'will', 'strays', 'far', 'traditional', 'lycanthropy', 'film', 'might', 'even', 'question', 'true', 'werewolf', 'film', 'have', 'asked', 'question', 'answer', 'yes', 'lack', 'better', 'classification', 'stick', 'film', 'into.Wealthy', 'business', 'man', 'wife', 'bodyguard', 'are', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'night', 'NYC', 'park', 'police', 'are', 'loss', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'feds', 'are', 'brought', 'suspect', 'terrorist', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'world', 'weary', 'police', 'detective', 'Dewey', 'Wilson', 'case', 'strange', 'hairs', 'victims', 'analyzed', 'zoologist', 'who', 'be', 'wolf', 'hairs', 'Dewey', 'first', 'ridiculous', 'wolves', 'NYC', 'Then', 'vagrants', 'junkies', 'unwanted', 'disappearing', 'alarming', 'rate', 'NYC', 'People', 'nobody', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'literally', 'slipped', 'cracks', 'system', 'disappeared', 'seem', 'be', 'disappearing', 'same', 'area', 'run', 'down', 'part', 'NYC', 'slated', 'be', 'demolished', 'revitalized', 'area', 'dread', 'ghostly', 'abandoned', 'buildings', 'looming', 'menacingly', 'hiding', 'horrors', 'untold', 'So', 'story', 'Wolfen', 'as', 'serious', 'horror', 'film', 'deer', 'running', 'life', 'pack', 'wolves', 'dreadful', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'thick', 'foreboding', 'could', 'shovel', 'way', 'Other', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'hilariously', 'wisecracking', 'coroner', 'Finney', 'figure', 'out', 'puzzle', 'very', 'somber', 'film', 'tension', 'particularly', 'potent', 'creepy', 'scene', 'where', 'Finney', 'bar', 'where', 'American', 'natives', 'hang', 'out', 'questions', 'answers', 'skin', 'gooseflesh', 'scene', 'just', 'amazing', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disaster', 'great', 'acting', 'dreary', 'surrounding', 'cinematography', 'make', 'blowing', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'really', 'build', 'solid', 'foundation', 'dread', 'scalp', 'tingling', 'finest', 'Finney', 'terrified', 'what', 'true', 'are', 'other', 'blood', 'pulsing', 'scenes', 'film', 'abandoned', 'church', 'scene', 'where', 'Finney', 'female', 'colleague', 'beautiful', 'Diane', 'Venora', 'who', 'part', 'anti', 'terrorist', 'team', 'hear', 'baby', 'cry', 'top', 'winding', 'stair', 'case', 'proceed', 'up', 'fists', 'clinch', 'imagination', 'wild', 'anticipation', 'Baby', 'crying', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'source', 'dread', 'horror', 'films', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'one', 'perfect', 'film', 'starting', 'scene', 'Mayor', 'NYC', 'hair', 'raiser', 'Wolfen', 'really', 'cinematography', 'special', 'sound', 'effects', 'get', 'tremendous', 'effect', 'also', 'note', 'film', 'first', 'POV', 'camera', 'cinema', 'shot', 'perspective', 'creatures', 'point', 'view', 'night', 'vision', 'detecting', 'heat', 'sources', 'sound', 'was', 'also', 'creatures', 'viewpoint', 'scenes', 'also', 'was', 'new', 'technique', 'effects', 'are', 'unsettling', 'say', 'least', 'camera', 'sound', 'keep', 'switching', 'creatures', 'perspective', 'prey', 'humans', ""'re"", 'just', 'waiting', 'carnage', 'begin', 'soundtrack', 'incredible', 'film', 'twist', 'turn', 'constrictor', 'squeezing', 'prey', 'amount', 'added', 'atmospheric', 'dread', 'invaluable', 'film', 'success', 'fault', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'ending', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'totally', 'engulfed', 'film', 'theatre', 'ending', 'kind', 'knocked', 'down', 'Today', ""'m"", 'different', 'opinion', 'ending', 'quite', 'suitable', 'let', 'alone', 'surprising', 'complimented', 'film', 'theme', 'perfectly', 'Also', 'note', 'director', 'film', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Michael', 'Wadleigh', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'was', 'Woodstock', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'have', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'obscure', 'treasure', 'totally', 'overshadowed', 'two', 'other', 'lycanthrope', 'films', '1981', 'worthy', 'bit', 'much', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'ending', 'see', 'again', 'open', 'mind', 'may', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'werewolf', 'type', 'movies', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'films', '80', 'believe', 'lot', 'competition']",N/A

First of all, one of the main reasons I don't like this film is that it was more gory than it needed to be and the disturbing hospital scene was really not necessary for the film to be effective.  Second, I thought it just ran on way too long, and about three quarters of the film, I really started to get antsy and wished the plot would speed up just a tad.  However, one of the main reasons I liked this film was the highly effective suspense when the wolves' presence was near.  This is especially noticed during the scene when both Albert Finney and his female detective partner are inside the old, run-down Gothic church and they kept hearing the sounds of the spirit wolves that had the eerie sound of babies crying in the night.  This I felt was HIGHLY effective and the music that was played added to the suspense very well.  Also, I thought it was interesting to see a movie that, to me, resembled a cross between ""Interview With The Vampire"" and ""Dances With Wolves"" with the elements of the old Gothic church, the ravishing blood and fangs, the Native Americans, and the environmental message--over 10 years before ""Interview"" and ""Dances"" would themselves make it to the silver screen. So, while I did enjoy some elements of the film, there were a number of elements that I felt they could have improved on.

109524,A186WNXTN6MBJ2,0790741954,Jorge Ruben,"[4, 8]","At the risk of adding yet another ""this movie was not like the book"" review, I will point to ""Jaws"" as a movie that deviated somewhat from the book, but still maintained the horror and impending sense of doom that the novel skillfully imparted.  ""Wolfen"", on the other hand, comes across as a heavy-handed and absurd treatise on the evils of overdeveloping land.  Michael Wadleigh, director of ""Woodstock"", seems to want to let the world know that he's a tree-hugger and proud of it.  While Whitley Streiber's excellent novel portrayed the wolfen as a super-intelligent race of hunters that systematically track down and destroy that which threatens their existence (mainly, Wilson and Neff, investigating the murders of two fellow cops committed by the wolfen), Wadleigh's adaptation blurs the line between survival and political activism.  Indeed, halfway through the film you expect the wolfen to show up with ""save the rainforests"" buttons pinned on their pelts.  Streiber's novel made the wolfen's mindset clear:  Destroy that which threatens us.  In that respect, the murders at the beginning of the book (the two police officers) are a mistake, a rash action by two young cubs which leads to more and more humans closing in on the wolfen.  The wolfen have managed to remain hidden for years due to their cunning; attack the old and infirm, those that will not be missed, and destroy the bodies, something which the two cubs ignored and is now threatening the existence of the pack.  The movie wolfen, on the other hand, basically attack a celluloid Donald Trump because he is razing over their slums and building an apartment complex.  The movie then turns into a neo-political whodunnit, with Native-American Edward James Olmos being considered for the crime, and then local trust-fund terrorists G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung being pegged for the deaths.  Suffice it to say, the wolfen of the novel would not have risked their existence being revealed by killing a developer; they would have merely moved on and searched for new hunting grounds.I give the movie two stars mainly because of the acting of the principles involved.  Albert Finney makes an impressive George ""Dewey"" Wilson, and looking back at it now it's hard to imagine anyone else in that role.  Gregory Hines' Whittington is a vast improvement over (the book's) curmudgeonly Wilson-hating Evans, and his interaction with Finney is a highlight.  Tom Noonan's Ferguson is note for note the Ferguson from the novel, and freshfaced Diane Venora is adequate as Neff (here relegated to a secondary role as opposed to co-headliner in the novel).  The scenes with the wolfen are merely OK, with Neff and Wilson investigating the old church and Wilson and Whittington staking out the wolfen as chilling as it's going to get.I won't go over the absurd ending of the film, but I will say this: See it for the curiosity factor, then read the novel.  You'll see where Michael Wadleigh (who also helped write the screenplay) injected his own politics into the film, and destroyed a fine concept in the process.",2,'Wolfen' not quite sure what it wants to be......,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,3068,"['risk', 'adding', 'yet', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'book', 'review', 'will', 'point', 'Jaws', 'movie', 'deviated', 'somewhat', 'book', 'still', 'maintained', 'horror', 'impending', 'sense', 'doom', 'novel', 'skillfully', 'imparted', 'Wolfen', 'other', 'hand', 'across', 'heavy-handed', 'absurd', 'treatise', 'evils', 'overdeveloping', 'land', 'Michael', 'Wadleigh', 'director', 'Woodstock', 'want', 'let', 'world', 'know', 'tree-hugger', 'proud', 'Whitley', 'Streiber', 'excellent', 'novel', 'portrayed', 'wolfen', 'super-intelligent', 'race', 'hunters', 'systematically', 'track', 'down', 'destroy', 'existence', 'mainly', 'Wilson', 'Neff', 'investigating', 'murders', 'two', 'fellow', 'cops', 'committed', 'wolfen', 'Wadleigh', 'adaptation', 'line', 'survival', 'political', 'activism', 'Indeed', 'halfway', 'film', 'expect', 'wolfen', 'show', 'up', 'save', 'rainforests', 'buttons', 'pinned', 'pelts', 'Streiber', 'novel', 'made', 'wolfen', 'mindset', 'clear', 'Destroy', 'respect', 'murders', 'beginning', 'book', 'two', 'police', 'officers', 'are', 'mistake', 'rash', 'action', 'two', 'young', 'cubs', 'more', 'more', 'humans', 'closing', 'wolfen', 'wolfen', 'have', 'managed', 'remain', 'hidden', 'years', 'due', 'cunning', 'old', 'infirm', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'destroy', 'bodies', 'something', 'two', 'cubs', 'ignored', 'now', 'threatening', 'existence', 'pack', 'movie', 'wolfen', 'other', 'hand', 'basically', 'attack', 'celluloid', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'razing', 'over', 'slums', 'building', 'apartment', 'complex', 'movie', 'then', 'neo-political', 'whodunnit', 'Native-American', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'being', 'considered', 'crime', 'then', 'local', 'trust-fund', 'terrorists', 'G', 'ouml', 'auml', 'being', 'pegged', 'deaths', 'Suffice', 'say', 'wolfen', 'novel', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'risked', 'existence', 'being', 'revealed', 'killing', 'developer', 'would', 'have', 'merely', 'moved', 'searched', 'new', 'hunting', 'grounds.I', 'give', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'mainly', 'acting', 'principles', 'involved', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'impressive', 'George', 'Dewey', 'Wilson', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'Whittington', 'vast', 'improvement', 'book', 'curmudgeonly', 'Wilson-hating', 'Evans', 'interaction', 'Finney', 'highlight', 'Tom', 'Noonan', 'Ferguson', 'note', 'note', 'Ferguson', 'novel', 'freshfaced', 'Diane', 'Venora', 'adequate', 'Neff', 'here', 'relegated', 'secondary', 'role', 'opposed', 'co-headliner', 'novel', 'scenes', 'wolfen', 'are', 'merely', 'OK', 'Neff', 'Wilson', 'investigating', 'old', 'church', 'Wilson', 'Whittington', 'staking', 'out', 'wolfen', 'as', 'chilling', 'going', 'get.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'absurd', 'ending', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'See', 'curiosity', 'factor', 'then', 'read', 'novel', ""'ll"", 'see', 'where', 'Michael', 'Wadleigh', 'who', 'also', 'helped', 'write', 'screenplay', 'injected', 'own', 'politics', 'film', 'destroyed', 'fine', 'concept', 'process']",N/A

A lot of people either hated Wolfen or left the theater with a shrug. It is based on a fine book but something got lost on the way to the big screen.Albert Finney is a terrific actor but he's wrong for this movie. He seems deeply uncomfortable in every single scene and I don't think it's just acting. The poor man is playing a New York City cop but his accent is all wrong. At best he sounds Canadian. On top of all this he mumbles his lines.The female lead does an okay job but her main reason for being here is to give Finney something to look at and the wolves something pretty to menace. There's an out of the blue sex scene but mercifully it's shot through the wolf's eyes so the audience doesn't get to see a semi naked Finney full on and in color.The only person who does well here was the late Gregory Hines, who plays a light hearted medical examiner. He gets killed of course but back when this movie was made the black guy always gets killed if not in the first reel then by the second.Indians, particularly those in New York were not pleased with this film and I can't really blame them. Edward James Olmos is a good actor but he's no more Indian than Finney was and it was obvious. This casting was just as offensive as gettitng a white actor, spraying bronzer on him and sticking a black plaited wig on his head.Now about the wolves. They aren't awesome in the least. It's just a pack of dogs. All of whom looked to me like they just needed a firm talking to and a milkbone.  The ending was weak and Finney's characte seems just as befuddled as he was at the beginning. Also, the film fails because it preaches. Nobody wants to be preached at by a B movie.

Coming in the 1980's, when the werewolf film was largely beinng redefined ('The Howling,' and 'An American Werewolf in London') 'Wolfen' truly set itself apart.Of course, the fact that it is not exactly a werewolf film has a bit to do with that.  Set in a New York City that seems almost post devastation, with scene after scene in the worst possible slums it is a revelation of people in woeful straits, and a study of the predators (human and otherwise) that live among them.  The film also flirts with Native American reality and myths and the nature of the pressures of urbanization.P>The bleak scene making, the totally believable performances by all the actors and the adept use of just enough violence and special effects combine to provide a compelling experience for the watcher.  Michael Wadleigh (who also directed 'Woodstock') displays a sense of timing that uses each discovery to catapult the tension to new levels.  This is not a film that permits clinical distance, but which strives to create a tumult of ideas that crystallize into a grand finale.'Wolfen' is a horror film that begs the question of what really is the true horror, the monster or the man.  My only regret is that this disc is pure film with no effort to provide any of the traditional extra features.  I was hoping for at least an interview or two, or even a short on the filmmaking, but none of that is provided.  Even so, I recommend this as a special treat for all horror buffs.",5,For Them There Can be No Lies,1032307200,"09 18, 2002",2002,1701,"['once', 'while', 'there', 'horror', 'film', 'something', 'more', 'viewer', 'unnexpectedly', 'pondering', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'master', 'more', 'recently', 'have', 'had', ""'Seven"", ""'Silence"", 'Lambs', 'Coming', '1980', 'when', 'werewolf', 'film', 'was', 'largely', 'beinng', 'redefined', ""'The"", 'Howling', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'truly', 'set', 'apart.Of', 'course', 'fact', 'not', 'exactly', 'werewolf', 'film', 'bit', 'do', 'Set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'almost', 'post', 'devastation', 'scene', 'scene', 'worst', 'possible', 'slums', 'revelation', 'people', 'woeful', 'straits', 'study', 'predators', 'human', 'otherwise', 'live', 'film', 'also', 'Native', 'American', 'reality', 'myths', 'nature', 'pressures', 'urbanization.P', 'bleak', 'scene', 'making', 'totally', 'believable', 'performances', 'actors', 'adept', 'use', 'just', 'enough', 'violence', 'special', 'effects', 'combine', 'provide', 'compelling', 'experience', 'watcher', 'Michael', 'Wadleigh', 'who', 'also', 'directed', ""'Woodstock"", 'sense', 'timing', 'discovery', 'catapult', 'tension', 'new', 'levels', 'not', 'film', 'clinical', 'distance', 'create', 'tumult', 'ideas', 'crystallize', 'grand', 'finale', 'horror', 'film', 'question', 'what', 'really', 'true', 'horror', 'monster', 'man', 'only', 'regret', 'disc', 'pure', 'film', 'effort', 'provide', 'traditional', 'extra', 'features', 'was', 'hoping', 'least', 'interview', 'two', 'even', 'short', 'filmmaking', 'none', 'provided', 'Even', 'so', 'recommend', 'special', 'treat', 'horror', 'buffs']",N/A

Wolfen is that rarity- that something that presents itself as one thing but winds up being entirely different.The surprise.Albert Finney plays Detective Dewy Wilson- called in on a high profile murder case that has all the earmarks of an execution. Finney's portray is weathered, worn and worth the watch from the word go. I love watching an actor who can convey a character's past in the seconds or minutes he or she is given to establish it. Very few can and Finney is one of them. His Dewey is a man on the edge- a man called in for cases like these, and a man whose nerves, sensibilities and reality are shot as a result of them.He is placed in the company of a young security expert (high tech intelligence) Diane Venora and they form an interesting duo/love interest as they try to unravel the murder(s). The late, great Gregory Hines is also enlisted (by Finney) as pathologist and he turns in a terrific, hip and solid performance as the only other character Finney's Wilson seems to collaborate with. Edward James Olmos also deserves special mention (pre Miami Vice) as a dramatic tease that winds up with some telling truths. "" You got your technology but you lost. You lost your senses "".The visual effect for the wolves sensory/hunt sequences is terrific (aided greatly by James Horner's score), and they take their time in introducing `the werewolves'- like any really good film does. Ultimately, what it really winds up being/meaning is food (pardon the expression) for thought.The film is based on the Whitley Striber novel (a really good read, too). David Eyre and Michael Wadleigh (who directs) did a terrific job with the screenplay- the characters are a proper mix of street and smarts and the mystically ancient.The Bronx scenes are properly eerie, disturbing and a visual testimony to some of our own poverty in North America.I won't ruin the story by revealing anymore but if you're looking for an overlooked gem in the horror/mystery field, this film will be of interest. It drew poor box office when it came out because it was lost in a `werewolves avalanche' of film releases (i.e.: The Howling, Silver Bullet, American Werewolf in London etc) but for my money, it was by far the most interesting, inventive and socially conscious.Good work has several levels and if you're looking for the thinking person's horror story- here's a good one for you.",3,A Wolf with Bite,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,2500,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'one', 'werewolves', 'films', 'always', 'seemed', 'silly', 'most', 'part-', 'think', 'have', 'been', 'Wolfen', 'rarity-', 'something', 'one', 'thing', 'up', 'being', 'entirely', 'different.The', 'surprise.Albert', 'Finney', 'Detective', 'Dewy', 'Wilson-', 'called', 'high', 'profile', 'murder', 'case', 'earmarks', 'execution', 'Finney', 'portray', 'weathered', 'worn', 'worth', 'watch', 'word', 'go', 'love', 'watching', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'convey', 'character', 'past', 'seconds', 'minutes', 'given', 'establish', 'Very', 'few', 'can', 'Finney', 'one', 'Dewey', 'man', 'edge-', 'man', 'called', 'cases', 'man', 'nerves', 'sensibilities', 'reality', 'are', 'shot', 'result', 'them.He', 'placed', 'company', 'young', 'security', 'expert', 'high', 'tech', 'intelligence', 'Diane', 'Venora', 'form', 'interesting', 'duo/love', 'interest', 'try', 'unravel', 'murder', 's', 'late', 'great', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'also', 'enlisted', 'Finney', 'pathologist', 'terrific', 'hip', 'solid', 'performance', 'only', 'other', 'character', 'Finney', 'Wilson', 'collaborate', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'also', 'special', 'mention', 'pre', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'dramatic', 'tease', 'up', 'telling', 'truths.', 'got', 'technology', 'lost', 'lost', 'senses', '.The', 'visual', 'effect', 'wolves', 'sensory/hunt', 'sequences', 'terrific', 'aided', 'greatly', 'James', 'Horner', 'score', 'take', 'time', 'introducing', ""werewolves'-"", 'really', 'good', 'film', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'really', 'up', 'being/meaning', 'food', 'pardon', 'expression', 'thought.The', 'film', 'based', 'Whitley', 'Striber', 'novel', 'really', 'good', 'read', 'too', 'David', 'Eyre', 'Michael', 'Wadleigh', 'who', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'screenplay-', 'characters', 'are', 'proper', 'mix', 'street', 'smarts', 'mystically', 'ancient.The', 'Bronx', 'scenes', 'are', 'properly', 'eerie', 'disturbing', 'visual', 'testimony', 'own', 'poverty', 'North', 'America.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'story', 'revealing', 'anymore', ""'re"", 'looking', 'overlooked', 'gem', 'horror/mystery', 'field', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'interest', 'drew', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'lost', 'werewolves', 'avalanche', 'film', 'releases', 'i.e', 'Howling', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'etc', 'money', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'inventive', 'socially', 'conscious.Good', 'work', 'several', 'levels', ""'re"", 'looking', 'thinking', 'person', 'horror', 'story-', 'here', 'good', 'one']",N/A

Dewey has had personal problems, he eats donuts after running and he delivers quick one liners like a detective in an old film noir.

Released in the same year as the infamous An American Werewolf in London and The Howling, Wolfen was almost guaranteed to be a video shelf reject. While the movie isn't bad in several areas, it just doesn't have what it takes to compete with it's two dominants, causing it to sink faster than a fin in the water. Yet there are admirable traits here, different ones that could cause the viewer to back up a few paces. Gore is great and acting is fine, so how about we take a closer look at this buried film victim?The story is generically basic in some aspects - meaning, it's been done before but in different ways than done here (if that makes a shred of sense) It's a social commentary heavy idea, almost too heavy, coming across as a bit preachy. Ok, we get the point by the end, but by this time it's like it's been rammed into our faces repeatedly. Too much of a good thing is never good. That's one qualm I hold with it right off the bat. I have read Strieber's work, although not Wolfen, and he does have the tendency to do unique twists on some of society's lapses. You might say his general author's theme is to show how man has really screwed nature over and will ultimately pay the price for it. During the 80's this was the big 'in' thing, environmental movies with animals made into monsters. (Prophecy with a mutated bear and Nightwing with killer bats followed the same path) It was also hot stuff to focus on the mistreatment of Indians, and their superior value and wisdom during the times (This was demonstrated in each movie)In this case a rich land developer is attacked in a cool manner by unseen creatures while at the slums, keeping the area in mind for an upgrade for the richer and more privileged community members. More bodies are unearthed, and enter the classic detective, played well by Albert Finney. He apparently went into retirement and now comes back but it's never clearly explained why. An explanation, even if short, would have put my mind at ease, but whatever. He enlists in the aide of the criminal psychologist (Diane Venora). Naturally they would choose a woman for at least one of these parts, as how else could they force an unneeded sexual relationship? Well, scratch that, they could still include an unneeded sexual relationship without her, but I doubt the R rating would have worked.They eventually discover that the attacks are from an old form of wolves. The werewolf story here is much different in the respect that they're not just savage beasts on the prowl, eager to rip into humans, but instead are connected with Indian legends, conservation efforts, protection tribe type deals, and morals/ethics. Blah, do morals belong in a horror movie? If done right it's effective. Did Wolfen accomplish this? Truthfully I'm undecided. I get the idea and its a valiant effort on the part of the filmmakers, but there just wasn't enough plot here with the scenes they incorporated. The pace dragged a bit and there were too many dull scenes for me to stay riveted to the screen. That alone would cause a movie to be easily forgotten, even if it does have some outstanding parts, a good idea, or gore. The zoologist spouting off warnings and lectures on the white man and his influences on the land grew slightly taxing.If you're looking for the good dirt, the 'wolves' look good, and actually rather creepy. There's certainly sufficient gore loads and levels here, and it's done in slightly creative manners. A couple of deaths are outstanding, and director Wadleigh manages to weasel in some more than adequate tension in several areas. POV shots during attacks and the hunt are awesome as well, and James Horners' score is decent for this type of flick.But if it's bad you're after, sadly this movie doesn't explain as much as it should have. I suspect studio involvement and scissors here. There's a slowness that doesn't exactly aide it, the story can be a little preachy at times, and it's probably not what werewolf fans are expecting when they pop the disc into their player. There are fake scares galore, too, including the clich&eacute; cat false alarm. With a movie that's trying to be original, why use such generically relied upon ploys? The shaky hand held camera gimmick overused did NOT help matters much, just like the overdone wolf POV in infrareds didn't either.Wolfen also tries to be a mystery of some sort, but why? The audience knows from the get go it's wolves doing the killings. We know from the movie blurb and the beginning itself. We have to sit there for over an hour while the detective slowly figures it out. And once the revelation comes, and the resolution is near, nothing that exciting occurs.Overall it IS a werewolf movie (or should I just say wolf?) worthy of watching, simply because it's different in both its approach and its message. If you're a fan of the furry you'll want to sample all the offerings out there in this sub-genre; perhaps, with ideas such as this one, that sub-genre is more massive than previously realized. With it's almost dreamy quality, it has a certain magic all its own, but as a shame it's a little boring and not that heartfelt.",3,"A little dull, but intriguing",1379635200,"09 20,

I was dissapointed that this dvd only has a trailer and no other special features. Wolfen was filmed beautifully in New York, Bklyn, Bronx, Staten Island. Wolfen really caught New York during 1980-1981,the big apple was some what different then. This film eerily catches the Bronx in a cold septic view. Wolfen made you very aware of the sociol class, poverty and drug problems of America during the early 1980s. The soundtrack by James Horner is simply awesome. In my opinion Wolfen was the best of the wolf movies of the early 1980s. They dont make movies like this anymore. This was Michael Wadleighs last film but really a well directed film with some interesting actors and charachters. Wolfen does have some political views as well as regarding mans technology against natures, and the treatment of the American Indian and thier connection to the wolf. Albert Finney plays an excellent NYPD detective. The late Gregory Hines an excellent pathologist. Veteran actor Dick O'neil plays a believable NYPD Captain. Diana Venora whatever became of Diane, but her charachter was really interesting to. This film also supplies some great landscape shots as well.

But when a human named Dewey Wilson (Albert Finney) enters the circle after a horrific triple murder he soon realizes that the killers are indeed wolves, and not just any wolves... but shape shifting wolves!Review: I have only read halfway through the book and I must say that while I read (along with the theme music playing on my I Pod in the background) the novel I felt as if I was there and being hunted by these creatures that have human-like qualities! The movie (which I saw when I was 8 and I still watch it 10 years after) gives off a dark atmosphere that nearly shatters the mind and forces you to watch and think of what is to happen next! The movie is not as good as the book and I can tell even though as I said before I have only read halfway through... the book is amazing told and I wish the movie was more known and the only way I found out about it was from my grandfather! I was overly surprised when I heard this film grossed a little over $10 million! The film also offers a lot of bloody deaths, superb jumpy and suspenseful moments, and a cool and original plot.... I do however despise most of the ending. I felt very let down that they were just regular wolves but I think it somewhat made up for it after the wolves disappeared in thin air (which I still don't quite understand why they do... it makes me wonder if they were shape shifter's or spirits) because the last minute is very breath taking with Albert Finney's speech and with the final shot of the church... it was all beautifully done! The film is worthy of a cult following in my opinion!Acting: Whoa, this acting was brilliantly done, I don't think I could've asked for a better lead role and they give off these kinds of feelings that all can't be described!Gore: bloody ripped throats, a throat ripped out so much that the head falls off, a severed hand, a disturbing morgue scene, a nasty disembowelment and more!Bottom Line: Out of the three werewolf/wolf movies that came out in 1981 this is my far the second best... in my opinion this kicks ""The Howling""(s) ass but it is no comparison to ""An American Werewolf in London""!Suggested MPAA: Rated: R for disturbing sequences of bloody violence, grisly images,language, some graphic nudity, sexual content, and drug materialIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 7For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 4 (I would give it a four and a half but sadly the site wont let me rate it that way)",4,"There are more dangerous things in the cities than drugs and criminals, ""There is no Defense""!",1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,2739,"['did', 'create', 'music', 'video', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'witnessed', 'youtube', 'called', 'Wolfen', 'Music', 'Video', 'Using', 'Song', 'Sarcofago', 'Plot', 'Wolves', 'Werewolves', 'Wolfen', 'decide', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'crumbled', 'old', 'church', 'terror', 'only', 'Indians', 'understand', 'when', 'human', 'named', 'Dewey', 'Wilson', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'circle', 'horrific', 'triple', 'murder', 'soon', 'killers', 'are', 'indeed', 'wolves', 'not', 'just', 'wolves', 'shape', 'shifting', 'wolves', 'Review', 'have', 'only', 'read', 'halfway', 'book', 'must', 'say', 'read', 'theme', 'music', 'playing', 'Pod', 'background', 'novel', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'being', 'hunted', 'creatures', 'have', 'human-like', 'qualities', 'movie', 'saw', 'when', 'was', '8', 'still', 'watch', '10', 'years', 'off', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'nearly', 'mind', 'forces', 'watch', 'think', 'what', 'happen', 'next', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'can', 'tell', 'even', 'said', 'have', 'only', 'read', 'halfway', 'book', 'amazing', 'told', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'known', 'only', 'way', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'grandfather', 'was', 'overly', 'surprised', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'grossed', 'little', '10', 'million', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'bloody', 'deaths', 'superb', 'jumpy', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'cool', 'original', 'plot', 'do', 'however', 'despise', 'most', 'ending', 'felt', 'very', 'let', 'down', 'were', 'just', 'regular', 'wolves', 'think', 'somewhat', 'made', 'up', 'wolves', 'disappeared', 'thin', 'air', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'do', 'wonder', 'were', 'shape', 'shifter', 'spirits', 'last', 'minute', 'very', 'breath', 'taking', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'speech', 'final', 'shot', 'church', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'film', 'worthy', 'cult', 'following', 'opinion', 'Acting', 'Whoa', 'acting', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'asked', 'better', 'lead', 'role', 'give', 'kinds', 'feelings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'described', 'Gore', 'bloody', 'ripped', 'throats', 'throat', 'ripped', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'head', 'off', 'severed', 'hand', 'disturbing', 'morgue', 'scene', 'nasty', 'disembowelment', 'more', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'three', 'werewolf/wolf', 'movies', 'came', 'out', '1981', 'far', 'second', 'best', 'opinion', 'Howling', 's', 'ass', 'comparison', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Suggested', 'MPAA', 'Rated', 'R', 'disturbing', 'sequences', 'bloody', 'violence', 'grisly', 'images', 'language', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'content', 'drug', 'materialIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '7For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '4', 'would', 'give', 'four', 'half', 'sadly', 'site', 'wont', 'let', 'rate', 'way']",N/A

109544,A1VQ4V2I0VIJA4,0790741954,"""songlife""","[4, 7]","This movie deservedly achieved some good reviews, but it's not anywhere near as intelligent as some have described it. The first half is a tense, well made, interesting mystery/thriller that also has some intriguing supernatural/metaphysical possibilities. Unfortunately though, around halfway through ""Wolfen"" takes a dive straight off a cliff and becomes boring and uninteresting. It then falls apart completely; the ending is laughable and preposterous.During the first half, the predator/killer remains unknown and unseen, and there is a great deal of mystery as to who or what is viciously killing people. We see the actual murders from the p.o.v. of the killer, via good and innovative Steadicam work. It's interesting to watch as Albert Finney slowly realizes  shapeshifting may be behind the murders. I was riveted to the screen and was thinking ""what a fantastic movie!"", despite some minor annoyances, which I'll get into momentarily.Around the halfway point, the wolf cam perspective and accompanying psychedelic colors and distortion started becoming tiresome, and the movie ceased being a tense thriller and instead turned into a really boring and ludicrous mess. Too many unanswered questions: why is the medical examiner accompanying the chief detective to a known hot spot with a rifle? Is he a sharpshooter in his spare time? Since when does a medical examiner go out to catch a mass murderer? Why does he immediately seclude himself, eating chips and beer, mooning the detective - knowing a killer is on the prowl? Answer: because the writer was too unoriginal to think of any other way to get him killed. And since when do wolves have the capability of severing limbs and heads, cleanly and in one lunge?Also, the characters are terribly underdeveloped. I couldn't have cared less about any of them. The chief of police is a cliched caricature - doesn't believe in the supernatural, thinks the investigating detective is nuts, then realizes the error of his ways, but does something stupid anyway. If I were that actor, I would have been complaining VERY loudly about the moronic lines he has to say and the ridiculous things he does at the end of the film. There is also a female in a lead role, but I have no idea why she's there except to make love to Finney for no reason, and get herself into danger that he has to get her out of. She has no reason for being in this movie. And I already mentioned Greg Hines' character, who is annoying and totally unrealistic. Leonard Maltin said Hines did a great job, but I disagree - he's awful, and whoever wrote his part is even worse. Finney does an adequate job, but the script really lets him down. He's forced to act like a Dirty Harry-type of cop at the beginning; slovenly, a rebel, near retirement. But there's no reason for any of that, it has no meaning at all toward the plot. In fact, much of the stuff they put in like that seems to be just filler in between the action, an attempt to give the characters some spark of life, and it doesn't work. These people are totally cardboard. The wolves are the stars of the movie, and we don't see them until near the end. And even then, they're obviously wolf dogs, not wolves, because wolves aren't the most cooperative actors.So ultimately, ""Wolfen"" ends up being one of those films that tries hard, but fails, despite its strengths. At it's heart, it's a message film, but it drenches the viewer in repulsive, unnecessary blood and gore strictly for the purpose of making more money at the box office. It also tries to be a mystery for the first half, which it succeeds at. But after the mystery is solved, it doesn't know where to go except to bore us with all the details and struggle with a conclusion. It's almost as if two different screenwriters wrote this: one intelligent guy did the first part, and a no-talent hack wrote the latter part. And just to make sure the movie is permanently ruined, they had Finney do a much-too-literal and melodramatic voiceover in the last scene to explain it all. It's a laughable attempt to end on a spiritual note, which is hard to do after they've just shown a man's head brutally decapitated and rolling in the street, eyes still blinking. This movie tries to be too many different things at once, it fails at most of them, and it's about 30 minutes too long. It does, however, get 3 stars from me because it was quite riveting for a while. Truly disappointing to see it blow up. Deservant of 2 1/2 stars, but they don't have halves here at Amazon. Wolf lovers will give this one 5 stars though - but the fact that Albert Finney's uninteresting character now respects them, which is where it all ends up, is a meaningless thing to base a film around.",3,Schitzophrenic screenwriter?,1032220800,"09 17, 2002",2002,4715,"['movie', 'deservedly', 'achieved', 'good', 'reviews', 'not', 'anywhere', 'as', 'intelligent', 'have', 'described', 'first', 'half', 'tense', 'well', 'made', 'interesting', 'mystery/thriller', 'also', 'intriguing', 'supernatural/metaphysical', 'possibilities', 'Unfortunately', 'halfway', 'Wolfen', 'dive', 'straight', 'cliff', 'boring', 'uninteresting', 'then', 'apart', 'completely', 'ending', 'laughable', 'preposterous.During', 'first', 'half', 'predator/killer', 'unknown', 'unseen', 'great', 'deal', 'mystery', 'who', 'what', 'viciously', 'killing', 'people', 'see', 'actual', 'murders', 'p.o.v', 'killer', 'good', 'innovative', 'Steadicam', 'work', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'slowly', 'shapeshifting', 'may', 'be', 'murders', 'was', 'riveted', 'screen', 'was', 'thinking', 'what', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'minor', 'annoyances', ""'ll"", 'get', 'momentarily.Around', 'halfway', 'point', 'wolf', 'cam', 'perspective', 'accompanying', 'psychedelic', 'colors', 'distortion', 'started', 'becoming', 'tiresome', 'movie', 'ceased', 'being', 'tense', 'thriller', 'instead', 'turned', 'really', 'boring', 'ludicrous', 'mess', 'Too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'why', 'medical', 'examiner', 'accompanying', 'chief', 'detective', 'known', 'hot', 'spot', 'rifle', 'sharpshooter', 'spare', 'time', 'when', 'medical', 'examiner', 'go', 'catch', 'mass', 'murderer', 'Why', 'immediately', 'seclude', 'eating', 'chips', 'beer', 'mooning', 'detective', 'knowing', 'killer', 'prowl', 'Answer', 'writer', 'was', 'too', 'unoriginal', 'think', 'other', 'way', 'get', 'killed', 'when', 'do', 'wolves', 'have', 'capability', 'severing', 'limbs', 'heads', 'cleanly', 'one', 'lunge', 'Also', 'characters', 'are', 'terribly', 'underdeveloped', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'chief', 'police', 'cliched', 'caricature', ""n't"", 'believe', 'supernatural', 'investigating', 'detective', 'nuts', 'then', 'error', 'ways', 'something', 'stupid', 'anyway', 'were', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'complaining', 'VERY', 'loudly', 'moronic', 'lines', 'say', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'end', 'film', 'also', 'female', 'lead', 'role', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'there', 'make', 'love', 'Finney', 'reason', 'get', 'danger', 'get', 'reason', 'being', 'movie', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Greg', 'Hines', 'character', 'who', 'annoying', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'said', 'Hines', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'disagree', 'awful', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'part', 'even', 'worse', 'Finney', 'adequate', 'job', 'script', 'really', 'down', 'forced', 'act', 'Dirty', 'Harry-type', 'cop', 'beginning', 'slovenly', 'rebel', 'retirement', 'reason', 'meaning', 'plot', 'fact', 'much', 'stuff', 'put', 'be', 'just', 'filler', 'action', 'attempt', 'give', 'characters', 'spark', 'life', ""n't"", 'work', 'people', 'are', 'totally', 'cardboard', 'wolves', 'are', 'stars', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'end', 'even', 'then', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'wolf', 'dogs', 'not', 'wolves', 'wolves', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'cooperative', 'actors.So', 'ultimately', 'Wolfen', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'films', 'hard', 'strengths', 'heart', 'message', 'film', 'viewer', 'repulsive', 'unnecessary', 'blood', 'gore', 'strictly', 'purpose', 'making', 'more', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'also', 'be', 'mystery', 'first', 'half', 'mystery', 'solved', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'go', 'bore', 'details', 'struggle', 'conclusion', 'almost', 'two', 'different', 'screenwriters', 'wrote', 'one', 'intelligent', 'guy', 'did', 'first', 'part', 'no-talent', 'hack', 'wrote', 'latter', 'part', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'movie', 'permanently', 'ruined', 'had', 'Finney', 'do', 'much-too-literal', 'melodramatic', 'voiceover', 'last', 'scene', 'explain', 'laughable', 'attempt', 'end', 'spiritual', 'note', 'hard', 'do', ""'ve"", 'just', 'shown', 'man', 'head', 'brutally', 'decapitated', 'rolling', 'street', 'eyes', 'still', 'blinking', 'movie', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'different', 'things', 'once', 'most', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'however', 'get', '3', 'stars', 'was', 'quite', 'riveting', 'while', 'Truly', 'disappointing', 'see', 'blow', 'up', 'Deservant', '2', '1/2', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'halves', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Wolf', 'lovers', 'will', 'give', 'one', '5', 'stars', 'fact', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'uninteresting', 'character', 'now', 'where', 'up', 'meaningless', 'thing', 'base', 'film', 'around']",N/A

109548,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0790741954,Wuchak,"[4, 5]","""Wolfen"" was adapted from Whitley Strieber's novel by director Michael Wadleigh, who directed the noteworthy ""Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music. ""Wolfen"" is the oddity of the three big werewolf films of 1981, which also includes ""The Howling"" and ""An American Werewolf in London."" Most people seem uncertain how to critique it because it wasn't what they were expecting. Is it even a werewolf film at all? Hence, the mixed reviews.The first 90 minutes of ""Wolfen"" play like a ""Dirty Harry"" yarn, albeit without the action, in New York City with Albert Finney as the weary detective. The murders mount up and the evidence seems to point to... well, I can't give it away.Although ""Wolfen"" is a horror film it fits within the nature-runs-amok sub-genre more so than the werewolf category.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The first hour & a half has a very lazy drive. Needless to say, people who have ADHD won't like ""Wolfen.""WHAT WORKS: Despite the sluggishness, the film definitely has a lot of mood, a memorable score, a serious and realistic vibe, good acting, excellent New York locations (especially the condemned slum areas) and Class A cinematography to warrant one's respect, particularly the many creature point-of-view shots that ""Predator"" later ripped-off.Regardless of all these good aspects, the film would have failed if there was no pay-off to the mounting mystery. Yet there's a powerful pay-off indeed: At the 90 minute mark Finney, half-dazed after the death of his buddy, lumbers into a Native American bar wherein the Indians powerfully explain the mystery. This 5 minute scene is, believe it or not, one of the most captivating, surreal and potent scenes in all of cinema; everything works -- the music, dialogue, acting & casting. This sequence could have easily failed if everything wasn't just perfect, but it is. And, speaking of the Indians, Edward James Olmos is outstanding as the mysterious Native, who may or may not possess shape-shifting abilities.The film wisely takes the ""Jaws"" route and doesn't reveal who or what the ""Wolfen"" are until the final half hour. Some have complained about the appearance of the wolfen, but I feel the fimmakers were quite successful; they look pretty scary to me and I wouldn't want to run into them on a dark lit street, or even in broad daylight for that matter. Seriously, the film-makers did the best they could in the pre-CGI era in which the film was made. Another thing to think about is the beauty of the wolfen shown clearly at the end. They're not monsters at all. They are, in fact, magnificent. Kudos to Michael Wadleigh for eschewing monster movie cliches and going for something original.I've heard the ending called everything from preposterous to dumb; yet aren't all such horror films preposterous by their very nature? I personally find the ending of ""Wolfen"" to be its greatest strength -- thought-provoking, atmospheric and powerful.FINAL WORD: ""Wolfen"" is well worth one's time because it's so original. Imagine Dirty Harry in New York City dealing with a Jaws-on-land situation and a healthy dose of Native American mythology and you'd have a pretty good idea of ""Wolfen."" Yes, it's a creatures-on-the-loose flick and has many slow stretches (with flashes of heavy gore), but it possesses an artistic flair and depth. I suppose you could call it a thinking-person's horror flick. Another plus is that it plays even better on repeat viewings.Runtime: 115 minutesGRADE: B+",4,"""Animals?
