It's a really good show that shows the different relationships between all of the main cast.  Some younger, some a little older and how they deal with eah other and the situations that are thrown at them depending upon their station in life.If you want to laugh, shake your fist and yell at the characters on your TV or pc, then I recommend this series.",5,"The title should be ""Hot Guys, Hot Ramen!""",1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,411,"['love', 'series', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'already', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'different', 'relationships', 'main', 'cast', 'younger', 'little', 'older', 'how', 'deal', 'eah', 'other', 'situations', 'are', 'thrown', 'depending', 'station', 'life.If', 'want', 'laugh', 'shake', 'fist', 'yell', 'characters', 'TV', 'pc', 'then', 'recommend', 'series']",N/A

If only it would have come with DVD extra's like blooper reels/deleted scenes....this would have made it hands down the best drama of the year.  Nevertheless, I recommend it, especially if you are a Jung Il Woo fan....he was AMAZING!",5,Coolest Movie EVER,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,368,"['Loved', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'beginning', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'dramas', 'ever', 'watch', 'packaging', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'DVD', 'extra', 'blooper', 'reels/deleted', 'scenes', '.this', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'down', 'best', 'drama', 'year', 'Nevertheless', 'recommend', 'especially', 'are', 'Jung', 'Il', 'Woo', 'fan', '.he', 'was', 'AMAZING']",N/A

With firsthand experience as an older woman with younger man it was nice to relive the twist and turns of this type of  relationship.  It is sad how society views this type of relationship, be it Western or Asian.  The idea of becoming a FAMILY because you happen to live and work with one another should be a interagal part of any society. This theme of comaraderie and family is why I thoroughly enjoyed this show.",5,Flower Boy Ramen Shop,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,484,"['little', 'farfetched', 'was', 'delightful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'firsthand', 'experience', 'older', 'woman', 'younger', 'man', 'was', 'nice', 'relive', 'twist', 'turns', 'type', 'relationship', 'sad', 'how', 'society', 'type', 'relationship', 'be', 'Western', 'Asian', 'idea', 'becoming', 'FAMILY', 'happen', 'live', 'work', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'interagal', 'part', 'society', 'theme', 'comaraderie', 'family', 'why', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'show']",N/A
