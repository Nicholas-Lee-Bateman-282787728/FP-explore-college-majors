For a made for TV western film it really is not that bad although I will admit I only got it because Lou Diamond Phillips is in the film. In Fact he is the star of the film and it is a good thing because with out him in it I don't know what the film would be like. Still it is a good flick that I would recommend to western movie fans, and of course to Lou fans. Since I am very much a fan of Lou Diamond Phillips I tend to like this flick although it is not a classic.Quirt Evans [Phillips] is an outlaw who is very much legendary but not enough to not be challenged, in which he does right from the first scene. Although he wins the battle with multiple opponents he still gets shot and is injured. He is found by a family who takes him in and begins to care for him. As he comes alive out of his sleep he awakes to the site of a woman. It is this woman he starts to fall for as she has already had the nurse affect happen to her. That of course is she was taking care of him and fell for him, simple and plain but it has happened.He is a very selfish and mean spirited person but these people's kindness starts to rub off on him. So much to the point that he starts to adopt their ways slowly and begins to help them out. Like straightening out the townspeople that hate them, oh yeah by the way they are Quakers. Of course there are people out for him from his past and the local sheriff is not happy about him being there. So there are a lot of things going on in the story but some times it does not seem that way.Written by Jack Nasser and James Edward Grant and directed Terry Ingram this TV remake while a good film is far from a classic. At times the film seems slow and makes you wish they pushed the pace a little. Also I guess going with the slow pace it seems like nothing is happening at times even when there is. The action is very good and so is the acting so I guess that does save it. And to be honest the film is not as bad as I make it sound.Of course Lou Diamond Phillips is great in the film as is every one else in it, well The Lou is always great so that is no surprise at all. Everyone else is good but Deborah Kara Unger sometimes just seems annoying. Luke Perry is good here as is John Wayne's grandson I believe Brendan Wayne as Lou's friend that comes into town. The town telegraph operator and the sheriff are both great in this flick as well.For a TV movie this is a good one and I would say I recommend seeing it, but only if you are a western or Lou diamond Phillips fan. It is far from horrible but the action is far apart and you realize it at times. But other than the slow movement the movie is a good one with good performances. Of course anything with the Lou is going to be owned by me, you know that.",3,GOOD FOR A TV REMAKE,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,2857,"['ANGEL', 'THE', 'BADMANYes', 'remake', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'made', 'TV', 'flick', 'made', 'TV', 'western', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'will', 'admit', 'only', 'got', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'film', 'Fact', 'star', 'film', 'good', 'thing', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Still', 'good', 'flick', 'would', 'recommend', 'western', 'movie', 'fans', 'course', 'Lou', 'fans', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'fan', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'tend', 'like', 'flick', 'not', 'classic.Quirt', 'Evans', '[', 'Phillips', ']', 'outlaw', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'legendary', 'not', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'challenged', 'right', 'first', 'scene', 'battle', 'multiple', 'opponents', 'still', 'shot', 'injured', 'found', 'family', 'who', 'care', 'alive', 'sleep', 'site', 'woman', 'woman', 'fall', 'already', 'had', 'nurse', 'affect', 'happen', 'course', 'was', 'taking', 'care', 'fell', 'simple', 'plain', 'happened.He', 'very', 'selfish', 'mean', 'spirited', 'person', 'people', 'kindness', 'rub', 'off', 'So', 'much', 'point', 'adopt', 'ways', 'slowly', 'help', 'out', 'straightening', 'out', 'townspeople', 'hate', 'oh', 'yeah', 'way', 'are', 'Quakers', 'course', 'are', 'people', 'out', 'past', 'local', 'sheriff', 'not', 'happy', 'being', 'there', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'going', 'story', 'times', 'not', 'seem', 'way.Written', 'Jack', 'Nasser', 'James', 'Edward', 'Grant', 'directed', 'Terry', 'Ingram', 'TV', 'remake', 'good', 'film', 'far', 'classic', 'times', 'film', 'slow', 'wish', 'pushed', 'pace', 'little', 'Also', 'guess', 'going', 'slow', 'pace', 'nothing', 'happening', 'times', 'even', 'when', 'action', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'acting', 'so', 'guess', 'save', 'be', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'make', 'sound.Of', 'course', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'else', 'well', 'Lou', 'always', 'great', 'surprise', 'Everyone', 'else', 'good', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'sometimes', 'just', 'annoying', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'good', 'here', 'John', 'Wayne', 'grandson', 'believe', 'Brendan', 'Wayne', 'Lou', 'friend', 'town', 'town', 'telegraph', 'operator', 'sheriff', 'are', 'great', 'flick', 'well.For', 'TV', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'say', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'only', 'are', 'western', 'Lou', 'diamond', 'Phillips', 'fan', 'far', 'horrible', 'action', 'far', 'apart', 'realize', 'times', 'other', 'slow', 'movement', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'good', 'performances', 'course', 'anything', 'Lou', 'going', 'be', 'owned', 'know']",N/A
