I was expecting something along the lines of ""Mystery Science Theater"", where the hosts would make off-the-wall comments while the film was shown.With these movies, Ms. Elvira makes comments at the intro and commercial break spots, which isn't bad but not what I was hoping for.  The print quality of the films is what you would expect for a late night, locally produced show complete with scratches in the film and pops and cracks in the audio. I must admit this brought back memories of my youth when I would stay up late and watch TV all night.",3,A Little Disappointed,1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,635,"['Living', 'east', 'coast', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', '80', '90', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'lines', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', 'where', 'hosts', 'would', 'make', 'off-the-wall', 'comments', 'film', 'was', 'shown.With', 'movies', 'Ms.', 'Elvira', 'comments', 'intro', 'commercial', 'break', 'spots', ""n't"", 'bad', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'print', 'quality', 'films', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'late', 'night', 'locally', 'produced', 'show', 'complete', 'scratches', 'film', 'pops', 'cracks', 'audio', 'must', 'admit', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'youth', 'when', 'would', 'stay', 'up', 'late', 'watch', 'TV', 'night']",Elvira's Movie Macabre: Legacy Of Blood / The Devil's Wedding Night
