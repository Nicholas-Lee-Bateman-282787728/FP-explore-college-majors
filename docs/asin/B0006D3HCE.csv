I love this film, it shows you how cruel, calcualted, and confused people are in life. Murphy dazzles as Stacy, a wanna-be type assoicate who dreams of working with her mentor/idol Diane Sawyer one day. Stacy takes a job at a daytime talk show and befriends a seemingly sweet producer played by Hunter. Great acting all around, well-written, and keeps you interested in a very unreal situation, I highly recommend this fun and unorthodox romantic comedy.",5,"""You're different.""",1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,567,"['Little', 'Black', 'Book', 'starring', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'not', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'love', 'film', 'how', 'cruel', 'calcualted', 'confused', 'people', 'are', 'life', 'Murphy', 'Stacy', 'wanna-be', 'type', 'assoicate', 'who', 'working', 'mentor/idol', 'Diane', 'Sawyer', 'one', 'day', 'Stacy', 'job', 'daytime', 'talk', 'show', 'seemingly', 'sweet', 'producer', 'played', 'Hunter', 'Great', 'acting', 'well-written', 'interested', 'very', 'unreal', 'situation', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fun', 'unorthodox', 'romantic', 'comedy']",N/A
865165,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006D3HCE,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 4]","Is it all right to say that this film surprised me?  Will I be shot whenever I try to talk to anyone about film if I say this?  Well, I am going to take a risk and be honest with everyone when I say that I actually enjoyed this film.  It was not at all what I was expecting and answered the question as to why Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates would choose to do a film of this level.  This was a very quirky film that suddenly went into this dark cavern at the end that left my jaw hanging wide open.  Little Black Book speaks about relationships, the honesty of life, and the brutal truth of the television programming we like to call, reality television.  Ever watch Jerry Springer and wonder how they get guests like that onto the show and be surprised by the truth that unfolds?  Well, strangely enough, Little Black Book answers those questions.  While Brittany Murphy headlines this film, she is definatly not the star.  Her acting ability takes back seat to some of the most powerful actresses in Hollywood and even backseat to a story that did not come from Hollywood's recycling bin.  This was a surprise film for me and proves yet again that you cannot judge a film by the way that the marketing team has decided to create the box and previews.I mentioned that Murphy's acting was not the pinnacle point to this film, and I cannot stress that enough.  The true stars of this film are Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates.  I though that they took these exceptionally small roles and defined the entire film with them.  This is especially truth with Holly Hunter.  Her character confused me throughout the entire film, constantly making me think that she took this role to pay more bills and that was all.  Then, when the ending took shape, I knew exactly why she agreed to this performance.  It was outstanding.  The ability that Hunter has to contain all that she needs until the very end was amazing for this film.  Normally, you don't expect to see that caliber of acting in a film called Little Black Book, but you do.  Hunter plays the part of the little red devil on Murphy's shoulder so well that it would be hard not to see it until the final moments.  I don't want to give anything away, but do not give up on the performances until the climactic ending.  You will be utterly surprised.  The same for Kathy Bates that seemed like she didn't do anything special, but I saw that she did.  She, again, took a very small character and almost centralized her to the entire film.  Not something I was expecting with this little ditty of a film.  Ron Livingston does decently well playing Berger ... I mean Derek.  While Murphy falls at the end of the pile due to constantly trying to upscale those actresses that surround her.  You could tell that she was trying to keep the focus on herself instead of working with her surrounding counter-parts.  This was the only negative aspect to the acting, the battle between Murphy's ego and the rest of the ensemble cast.If this film could win any award out there, I think that it deserves a writing award.  Screenwriter Melissa Carter has taken everything we know about romantic Hollywood films and almost repotted it into the world of reality television.  These were two avenues that I didn't think could be combined, but they were and done with the skill of a find author.  What I mean by this is that the story flowed.  There were not any jumps, bumps, or painful moments from the beginning to the end.  The writing was surprisingly strong for this film.  I was not expecting some of the lines to come from our actress's mouth, but they did and were very poignant to the plot.  This was not a film overly cluttered with cheesy catch-lines like ""You've Got Mail"" and ""You had me at `Hello"""".  The lines for this film were dark and a bit disturbing which surprised me that I didn't catch on to them earlier in the film.  Again, I was ready for a simple romantic comedy, but found something disturbingly original and different in both the acting and writing.Finally, I would like to say that without modern technology this would have been a very simple love story.  The characters would have remained in one place without the excitement of a PALM or computer.  So, my next question to you is this, is modern technology the true villain of this film?  There is the obvious one that appears near the end, but I don't think the idea of technology as the villain is ever presented.  If it weren't for the PALM that Derek gives Stacy, none of this would have happened.  They would have gone about their lives happy and none the wiser.  Perhaps this film would have still been made, except with the modern technology it would have been labeled as a sci-fi, and that would have been an all together wild ride for anyone tuning in.  Perhaps I have wandered off the beaten path a bit with this idea, but as I was writing this review I was thinking of how much emphasis there is on technology in this film, and perhaps director Nick Hurran was slightly slapping us in the face with this notion of evil technology.  Something to think about as you watch this film.Overall, I was impressed.  As the laughter from my peers continues to engulf me, I stand by my decision and proudly wave it above my head.  If you can get past Murphy's role and acting in this film, then I think you will also see the originality and creativity behind this picture.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Omission is

865166,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0006D3HCE,Alex Udvary,"[2, 8]","""Little Black Book"" might not be the kind of movie you're expecting it to be. I can't tell you what kind of movie it is, because that wouldn't be fair and I'd end up revealing secrets I shouldn't have,but, what I can do is tell you what kind of movie it's not.If you've seen the trailer for the movie you might have expected, as I did, a mainstream, brain dead, toilet humor, chick flick, revenge movie. It's not. The movie makes an attempt to have a moral. But does it pull it off?Much of the film's appeal will have to do with how you interpret Brittany Murphy as an actress. I don't feel she is a great or for that matter good actress. She is fine for the roles she picks, or maybe it's typecasting, but I don't think she would fit in another type of movie. I'd be surprised to see her in a Martin Scorsese film or one of  Coppola's, Woody Allen's, Steven Spielberg's or David Mamet's.Murphy plays Stacy Holt a young woman whom from a young age concludes she has all of life's little problems worked out. Everything in life comes down to chance. This is particulary true when it comes to relationships. If it doesn't ""feel"" right it's probably not.But Stacy has other ambitions. She wants to work for Diana Sawyer. Not BE her but work FOR her.So now it seems the movie is trying to cover two bases. Romantic comedy and a journalism movie in the tradition of ""Broadcast News"" or ""Network"" (Two vastly sharper movies).Kathy Bates plays Kippie Kann, host of one of those crazy talk-shows that people like to go on and embarrass themselves. This is where Stacy gets her first big job. There she meets Barb (Holly Hunter) and they form a friendship.Now one day Stacy finds out her boyfriend Derek (Ron Livingston) has not been entirely honest with her and she finds out by going through his little black book about his past flames.What ""Little Black Book"" suffers from is going for the obvious. Does the movie really think it's making some sort of statement? Much of the humor I found flat and don't remember the audience laughing it up either. A few chuckles maybe. The film's best joke comes at the end.Much of the story-line seems vague and a lot of the character are not cleary defined. Two ex-girlfriend characters come to mind. Lulu (Jessie Maran) and Dr. Rachel Keyes (Rashinda Jones). They border-line on cartoon figures.There is an audience for this movie. My guess is those who enjoyed ""Raising Helen"" will enjoy this one. ** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Tepid Brittany Murphy vehicle that doesn't offer many laughs.

865167,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B0006D3HCE,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I rented this movie because I couldn't find anything else in, and low and behold I actually came across a movie that has a nice little message tucked into it:  life is not a series of planned events.  The movie has one heck of a cast with the likes of Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates, but the actresses are little more than supporting, second-fiddle players to the vastly out of her league Brittany Murphy.  Don't get me wrong, Murphy certainly has some potential as an actress, but every movie she does is a variation on the same weepy lost soul she plays in this movie.  She's still the Cher wannabe from Clueless; in fact, the only real acting role she's ever done is Don't Say A Word.  The movie is not without its upsides:  the plot is a nice little swipe at the reality TV, Jerry Springer world we live in these days and it has real moments of poignancy.  Unfortunately, the characters played by Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates, which do have real moments of introspection, just don't work on a larger level; in fact, it often seems like Hunter and Bates were ashamed of these roles -- and they should be, the roles are not worthy of either actress.  The real highlight role of this film is that of the unrequited lover, Joyce, played wonderfully by the very freckled Julianne Nicholson.  Nicholson is an actress we often see playing these sub-supporting roles who shines everytime.  I wish someone would give this woman a role she could sink her teeth into because she would be fantastic.  Little Black Book might have been better if it had been played more as a dramatic film with moments of fun, but the director and writers chose instead to do little more than a sitcom with brief moments of drama.  Great potential brought down by mis-direction and mis-casting, but with a great Carly Simon soundtrack.",3,Better Than It Has A Right To Be,1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,1807,"['rented', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'else', 'low', 'behold', 'actually', 'came', 'movie', 'nice', 'little', 'message', 'tucked', 'life', 'not', 'series', 'planned', 'events', 'movie', 'one', 'heck', 'cast', 'likes', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'actresses', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'supporting', 'second-fiddle', 'players', 'vastly', 'league', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Murphy', 'certainly', 'potential', 'actress', 'movie', 'variation', 'same', 'weepy', 'lost', 'soul', 'movie', 'still', 'Cher', 'wannabe', 'Clueless', 'fact', 'only', 'real', 'acting', 'role', 'ever', 'done', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'A', 'Word', 'movie', 'not', 'upsides', 'plot', 'nice', 'little', 'swipe', 'reality', 'TV', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'world', 'live', 'days', 'real', 'moments', 'poignancy', 'Unfortunately', 'characters', 'played', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'do', 'have', 'real', 'moments', 'introspection', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'larger', 'level', 'fact', 'often', 'Hunter', 'Bates', 'were', 'ashamed', 'roles', 'should', 'be', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'worthy', 'actress', 'real', 'highlight', 'role', 'film', 'unrequited', 'lover', 'Joyce', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'very', 'freckled', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'Nicholson', 'actress', 'often', 'see', 'playing', 'sub-supporting', 'roles', 'who', 'shines', 'everytime', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'give', 'woman', 'role', 'could', 'sink', 'teeth', 'would', 'be', 'fantastic', 'Little', 'Black', 'Book', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'played', 'more', 'dramatic', 'film', 'moments', 'fun', 'director', 'writers', 'chose', 'instead', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'sitcom', 'brief', 'moments', 'drama', 'Great', 'potential', 'brought', 'down', 'mis-direction', 'mis-casting', 'great', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'soundtrack']",N/A

Movie starts. Two hours later, we all died. Horribly. But since this is my first review, I'll save you the trouble and tell you ALL.First, Brittany Murphy, or 'Stacy' explains how her mom was obsessed with an obscure disco queen from the 70's, and how her music was the only thing that helped through the tough problems with her husband (stacy's dad). Which just goes to show how screwed up her daughter will be. So all through stacys life she has problems with men. And so, she sings Carly Simon songs.Fast forward: she has a current boyfriend who's 'the one' (her keanu reeves) and when she finds out he humped a supermodel she gets upset. Once he is gone on vacation, she grabs his palm... and the main plot gets shot to hell. What i haven't mentioned is the subplot: Stacy works for a Jerry Springer parody called ""Kippy Kan Do"" hosted by Kippie (Cathy Bates). Of course, she uses this as a way to get to the exgirlfriends, by saying their going to get interviewed, when really she is asking how serious their sex lives were. Strange, and stupid. Holly Hunter (Elastigirl from the Incredibles) looks bad, and has stroke mouth. Stacy has the stereotyped Gay friend, and tough girl (holly) with a heart of gold. This movie was predictable, and pushy, trying to make you believe this could happen.The movie spirals into nothingness, not quite deciding if its a reality talk show parody, romantic comedy, or black dramedy. Also, they try to make things sexy, when it just ends up making Brittany look whorish. Like her getting to be CLOSE friends with one of his exgirlfriends (almost lesbianic), and getting another (an ob-gyn) to inspect her.Even in the end, they don't end up together. Except they do. Again, nothing seems to make sense.The special features (and I use this term loosely) aren't much better than the rest of the film. In fact, you'll get two crappy featurettes about... who knows what they were trying to say? And widescreen/fullscreen and dual language subtitles. Thats it.

Brittany Murphy stars as the suspicious lover who is egged on by her co- worker, who is played by Holly Hunter, to look into her boyfriends palm pilot to find out about his past relationships. She gives in to the temptation and she doesn't like what she sees.The plot of this movie is a little bit more original than other films. No secret love letters are found here- the device that exposes everything is a palm pilot. And the different performers in the movie are brought together in the end as part of a talk show episode. The show happens to be one where Brittany Murphy is employed. This has the makings for a halfway interesting movie, but it doesn't quite succeed.Of all the mishaps in this film, the ones that bother me most are the mundane dialogue and the unreal and contrived parts of the script. Throughout the movie, we are forced to listen to Brittany Murphy as she narrates some scenes and tries to communicate what she is feeling to the other women (who do not know she is dating their ex- boyfriend). The script isn't funny at all, even though the movie is billed as a romantic comedy. And the fact that the other women include a brainless model and a gynecologist is contrived and unreal. Also, it bothered me that the main actor in the movie, Ron Livingston (the boyfriend) is only shown on the screen for about ten to fifteen minutes tops. He deserved more time than this, since he is one of the main parts of the plot.This is a weak movie any way you cut it, and most people will probably find it forgettable. I have seen worse, yes, but I have also seen better attempts at romantic comedies than this one.

865180,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0006D3HCE,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[28, 36]","As a general rule, I try to avoid anything with Holly Hunter in it - but Brittany Murphy is just so darn cute, and Kathy Baker always turns in a great performance, so I decided to give Little Black Book a go.  It was a good decision.  The film was different and very entertaining, in a weird sort of way, and even Holly Hunter wasn't that bad.  I guess you could call this a romantic comedy, although it certainly doesn't fit the mold perfectly.  It's also a satire, using one of those awful daytime talk shows our society is now cursed with as the fulcrum for everything that takes place.Brittany Murphy is Stacy Holt, a young woman cruising up the escalator of happiness - at first.  She just got a job as an associate producer for The Kippie Kann Show, and she thinks she has finally found Mr. Right and his first name is Derek (Ron Livingston).  Then Derek goes out of town for a couple of weeks, and Stacy's co-worker Barb (Holly Hunter) gets her wondering about good old Derek's past.  She discovers all kinds of pictures on his PDA and seeks out and interviews three of his former girlfriends, making them think she is pre-interviewing them for a segment about them (all are quite successful in their own sorts of ways) on The Kippie Kann Show.  A comedy of error ensues.  As you might suspect, there's a really big twist to the whole story, one that doesn't exactly come at you from the blind side, but I'm not going to ruin it for anybody.Some people say Holly Hunter steals the show; she's good, but Brittany Murphy carries the whole movie as far as I'm concerned (I loved Kathy Bates as Kippie Kann, but hers was something of a secondary character).  I'm not saying Brittany Murphy is the only actress who could have played Stacy Holt, but this movie would have bombed with many another actress.  Stacy had to be refreshingly young, nave, and - well - bouncy in an adorable kind of way, and she also had to turn that sort of emotional vulnerability on its head and trawl the depths of human drama.  To steal a line from Carly Simon, whose music is featured prominently throughout the entire film, it would seem that nobody does it better than Brittany Murphy.In addition, I always try to give credit to our four-legged actors who turn in great performances and get no credit whatsoever.  The dog that plays Bob was just great, and I can't say how happy I am to see a large dog playing a role that calls for no slobbering whatsoever.  This dog turns in one of the best large dog performances I've seen in quite a while.Having watched the movie, I must say I didn't find myself wondering what I would do in the kind of situation Stacy gets herself into, though; this isn't really one of those films that make you go hmmm, in my opinion.  It's just a delightfully funny movie that comes with a free dish of human drama on the side.  I don't understand those who find this film depressing; certainly, it has its moments, but the ending, while different from what you might expect, is actually rather light and upbeat.  Basically, Little Black Book is a comedy with more depth than you might expect, and I for one quite enjoyed it.

I admit I wasn't expecting a fantastic movie, and I really only watched it because I heard that Gavin Rossdale had a small part in the movie.  (I thought he was so yummy back in the 90s when he was the lead singer of Bush!)  Anyway, even his brief appearance didn't make the movie any better, in my opinion.I didn't care at ALL about the main character, Stacy.  She must be very nave to not have known her boyfriend was still in contact with not one, two, but ALL three of his ex-girlfriends.  Especially considering she was practically living with him!Even after Barb went behind Stacy's back to do the show, ""Little Black Book,"" I still didn't care.  She had a chance to do something, anything, to get back at Barb and she didn't even take it!  The only person I did feel sorry for in this movie was Joyce, and that was because of how Stacy betrayed her.  By the way, what ever happened with Joyce?  Did she and Derek get back together?Ugh, there were other things that went unresolved but I can't think of them at the moment.  I just don't think this movie knew what it was about and what to do with what it had.  When it ended, all I could do was say, ""What?""

She was just disoriented and groping her chest and saying it was raining, even though the sky was perfectly clear and blue! But to be sure, this movie could make any blue sky seem a dingy grey. It must be  always a totally bad sign when a movie's most likeable character is a reeking flatulant dog. They could have totally have made what little of this is worth watching a thousand times better by making it a talking dog like Scooby-Doo, but no one behind this yuckfest was clever enough to think of that, I'm sure. There's a talk show host in this named Kippie,played by Kathy Bates. Kippie fancies herself a great boon to all humankind in her show ""Kippie Can Do"". But in fact she is totally a self-absorbed insolent brat who would make Jenny Jones or Sally Jessy Rafael look like Mother Teresa by comparison! And as if that weren't enough, Kathy Bates isn't the only overrated Oscar-winning has-been to muck uo this excursion into nausea. Kippie has a chief underling played by Holly Hunter, who is SO overdue to admit to having found no holly and retire. The only halfway likeable person working for the ""Kippie Can Do"" show is Stacy (thought she's often called something else) played by Brittany Murphy. Yes, she injects a tad of likeability into this film, but sadly her co-workers are determined to jerk her down to their level. They plant seeds of doubt in Stacy's mind as to the faithfulness of her boyfriend. Oh yes, her boyfriend is the one who has, or at least has joint custody of the fa#ting pooch. They encourage Stacy to interview previous girlfriends of her boyfriend under the pretnese that it is for the show (or is it really?). Stacy gets into totally awkward situations, as one ex-girlfriend almost introduces Stacy to a ""good friend"" who is actually Stacy's boyfriend. And Stacy poses as a patient to one of her boyfriend's ex-girlfriends, who is a gynecologist who has been misrepresented as a podiatrist. Just how a gynecologist gets misrepresented as a podiatrist is either something unexplained or something I missed (and I'm totally not going to to see the movie again to find out which!) (...) The climax of the movie turns out to be an episode of the talk show where Stacy and four of her boyfriend's ex-girlfriends are brought onto the stage together, so totally unaware of this five-way meeting planned for them, to encounter each other in a huge shockfest. The movie must be totally aimed at convincing even the most romantic among us that love totally stinks. Shame on Kippie and her co-creeps for inflicting this muckfest on five unsuspecting cast members and a movie audience. You should be so totally glad I warned you. To think how this is two hours of my life that I totally can't get back! I could have so better spent the time hanging out at the nearby bookstore! What's the worst that could happen there? I could get layed up in the little girls' room the whole time with my friend Karen perhaps totally laughing at me.

It wasn't so much that it was a bad movie, as it was that it was not at all what I expected.  The movie has an interesting twist and the premise is certainly intriguing, but ""romantic comedy"" it is not.  If you're looking for a good Meg Ryan-esque light-hearted comedy, look elsewhere.  The previews led one to believe that would be what you got, but nothing could be further from the truth.  This movie was more Jerry Springer meets My Best Friend's Wedding.  The movie drags quite a bit in the beginning and the chuckles are very few.  Murphy is adorable as ever in the movie, but that's just not enough.

865197,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B0006D3HCE,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[1, 3]","Brittany Murphy and Holly Hunter star in this way below mediocre ""romantic comedy"" about two producers at the Jerry Springer-esque Kippie Kann show. Kippie Kann (Kathy Bates) is supposedly losing viewers and they want to give the show a new twist. Accordingly, they take all sorts of new ideas for shows to make Kippie a bit less trashy. One of them: Little Black Books, or electronic ones like Palms and Blackberries. After her boyfriend lets it slip that he used to date a well-known model, Brittany Murphy's character, Stacy, takes her work home with her when he goes out of town and she finds herself inexplicably drawn to the Palm he left at home. Before you know it she's contacting all of his exes under the guise of getting them to be guests on the show, but in reality just because she can't trust her man.This movie was tedious in a way that I can't even put into words, but I think it's enough to say that the hour and a half of my life that I will never get back will be sorely missed. The plot hinges on the idea that if you're dating someone who doesn't tell you every single minute detail of his dating life before you got together, that it's okay to snoop through his belongings and use duplicity and manipulation to find out the things you want to know. It paints a dreary picture for the state of true love, and it doesn't even do so with good acting or a strong plot. In fact, the only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is because Gavin Rossdale has a cameo and I just don't see enough of him these days. Take my advice and stay far far away from this stinker. If you want to be depressed about the state of relationships in today's world rent Closer, at least then you'll have some good acting to enjoy with the movie's pessimistic view of love.",2,"You'll never get this time back, so take my advice and don't do it",1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,1781,"['Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'star', 'way', 'mediocre', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'producers', 'Jerry', 'Springer-esque', 'Kippie', 'Kann', 'show', 'Kippie', 'Kann', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'supposedly', 'losing', 'viewers', 'want', 'give', 'show', 'new', 'twist', 'Accordingly', 'take', 'sorts', 'new', 'ideas', 'shows', 'make', 'Kippie', 'bit', 'less', 'trashy', 'One', 'Little', 'Black', 'Books', 'electronic', 'ones', 'Palms', 'Blackberries', 'boyfriend', 'used', 'date', 'well-known', 'model', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'character', 'Stacy', 'work', 'home', 'when', 'town', 'inexplicably', 'Palm', 'left', 'home', 'know', 'contacting', 'exes', 'guise', 'getting', 'be', 'guests', 'show', 'reality', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'man.This', 'movie', 'was', 'tedious', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'put', 'words', 'think', 'enough', 'say', 'hour', 'half', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'missed', 'plot', 'hinges', 'idea', ""'re"", 'dating', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'tell', 'single', 'minute', 'detail', 'dating', 'life', 'got', 'together', 'okay', 'snoop', 'belongings', 'use', 'duplicity', 'manipulation', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'want', 'know', 'dreary', 'picture', 'state', 'true', 'love', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'so', 'good', 'acting', 'strong', 'plot', 'fact', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'Gavin', 'Rossdale', 'cameo', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'days', 'Take', 'advice', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'stinker', 'want', 'be', 'depressed', 'state', 'relationships', 'today', 'world', 'rent', 'Closer', 'least', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'acting', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'pessimistic', 'view', 'love']",N/A
865198,A2GBQRSI8FPAL,B0006D3HCE,K. O. Gibson,"[2, 2]","First, this review is written with the recent death of the film's star Brittany Murphy in the back of my mind as a first-time viewer of this movie. Far from the chick-lit/rom-com that it would appear to be, the film has several agendas it's attempting to humorously convey: insecure girlfriend whose snooping creates havoc with herself and her beau's ex-girlfriends; the back-biting work environment of a low-brow talk show set (done before and better in, say, 'Hope Floats' and 'The 24 Hour Woman'); and the personal striving of the lead character a la 'Working Girl'.The romantic comedy aspect doesn't grab you simply because the lead couple, Brittany Murphy and Ron Livingston, have no real chemistry; mainly because their relationship isn't really seen since they're in separate locations for much of the film. They have a dog in common, complete with cutesy cut-aways (dog barking, dog looking quizically, dog licking himself, dog pulling the gaunt Murphy down the sidewalk, etc.) that make them seem like any  generically mismatched urban couple with a big, cute dog as the binding glue and who eat a lot of take-out. In that sense of the story, the box cover and the concept doesn't really ring true.The working aspect of the film with Murphy's character, whose idols are the lusty yet patrician Carly Simon and Diane Sawyer, shares space with the romantic comedy plot. Murphy wants to make it from the New Jersey set of her trashy talk show employer to network news. Her co-worker, played by Holly Hunter, appears to take her under her wing and become an older BFF, gamely nudging her along with a potential talk-show idea of what happens when one starts going into her boyfriend's Palm. From there the film goes into a more dramatic tone that's one part Ally McBeal and one-part 'Network'-no spoilers here- and it's worth watching for the final showdown of sorts.The performances are what sell the film. Brittany Murphy, rest her professional and likable soul, tries her best to carry the movie but is somewhat of a wan, spindly heroine who often comes across, via drawn-out scenes of her paranoid snooping and scheming, as somewhat manic and jangly. She's a likable and game actress but the enthusiasm and spark of her work in 'Uptown Girls', for example, is noticably missing. It seems at times like it's an effort for her but she does a game job and the end credits can't help but be sad in hindsight at such a premature loss of life and talent.Holly Hunter, at first seems out of place in the film with her Oscar-winning chops, is all glam, 'Thirteen'-style ringlets and sinewy grit in hip-hugging jeans as an associate producer who could be the polar opposite of her iconic 'Broadcast News' character. Her character choices in the film, the way she can make a cigarette a prop or randomly spin Murphy in a chair, are unscripted touches that don't take over the film but show commitment. Holly Hunter is the 50-Foot Talent who takes this film and makes it her own, gamely relinquishing it at the end so that Murphy can take the final bow. Her performance and her character's sneaking up on you is worth viewing the movie for alone.'Little Black Book' isn't bad despite the clumsy moments and would seem right at home as a rainy day Sunday movie or a fan favorite for admirers of its stars.

865200,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006D3HCE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 11]","Of course ""Little Black Book"" is not about a little black book, but its 21st century equivalent, the Palm Pilot.  But then this 2004 film tries to pass itself off as a romantic comedy and it is more of a satire than anything else.  The selling point is that Stacy Holt (Brittany Murphy) gains access to the Palm Pilot of her boyfriend, Derek (Ron Livingston), and jumps through the ""rabbit hole"" and proceeds directly to Hell.  We know this because at the beginning of the film we are treated to Stacy in a state of shock, sitting behind the wheel of her yellow Beetle and ignoring the traffic jam she has caused.  So we know that when she compares herself to Pandora, the figurational logic is going to hold up and Stacy will end up someplace where no Carly Simon song can save her.  This is because it appears the most important thing Stacy learned from her mother (Sharon Lawrence), is that all of life's traumas can be healed by the right Carly Simon song.What magnifies the disaster is that Stacy, who dreams of being Diane Sawyer's assistant, has gotten a job being an associate producer on the ""Kippie Kann Do Show.""  Kippie (Kathy Bates) is the star of this second-rate daytime talk show whose aspiration is to be Jerry Springer with a larger audience.  But the show is dropping in the ratings and so the staff is on the lookout for the most sensationalist stories possible.  The best of the bunch will be part of the show's special ""live"" broadcast, a well-known recipe for disaster in modern cinema.  This film tries to make a joke of such shows, but it is like trying to make fun of the ""National Enquirer.""  You cannot come up anything so absurd that it does not sound real for a trashy magazine or a trashy television talk show.The idea of doing a show about a ""little black book"" is the brainstorm of one of the other associate producers, and when Stacy learns Derek once dated the super model Lulu Fritz (Josie Maran) she wonders what else her boyfriend has not told her about.  Encourage by Barb (Holly Hunter), an associate producer at the other end of the food chain, Stacy uses the cover of the show as an excuse for interviewing not only Lulu, but two more of Derek's former girlfriends, Dr. Rachel Keyes (Rashida Jones) and Joyce (Julianne Nicholson).  There are plenty of warnings that Stacy is going down the path to disaster (e.g., Dr. Keyes is NOT a podiatrist), but this film has an appointment with a train wreck of massive proportions that must be held.The train wreck is what justifies watching this movie.  Once it becomes clear that Stacy is going to destroy her life it is hard to root her on but it is also difficult to believe she deserves her fate.  The script by Melissa Carter and Elisa Bell does not shy away from Stacy dealing with the consequences of what she has done, and the big confrontations are handled relatively honestly.  By that point we understand this is not a romantic comedy and that those rules do not apply, a point that the script underscores in one more harsh but necessary lesson for Stacy.  The happy ending smacks totally of deus ex machina, but does provide the best laughs of the film.Of course, I am reading director Nick Hurran's film from a male perspective.  On one of the two short featurettes that constitute the sparse special features the director talks about how women detest Derek for his sins of omission in not telling Stacy everything she wants to hear, whether it hurts her or really hurts her, while men think Derek is a pretty good guy.  I found myself thinking that Derek's relationships with two of his ex-girlfriends are pretty good friendships and that the one he stays clear of is an appropriate choice as well.  But even if we are convinced by the women of the world that Derek is wrong not to tell Stacy everything, by not telling her the truth he is not being malicious.  Unfortunately, Stacy does overstep the boundaries of decency and become malicious, which puts us in the uncomfortable position of getting to the point of not liking the heroine of the film.This is another one of those films, like ""Uptown Girls,"" that requires Murphy to get beat up by the world so that she can bounce back.  The problem is that it seems such an abrupt and radical transition when she goes from the flighty young woman trying to piece together her boyfriend's love life to the shattered young woman who suddenly discovers the betrayer has herself been betrayed.  Of the two Oscar winning actresses in the supporting roles, Bates is given little to do but play the caricature of a prima donna star of a trashy television show, while Hunter has the more substantial role to play in the film.  Fortunately we know as soon as we meet her that she is not somebody to trust, although we are not clear as to the part she is playing in this drama.It is Hunter's performance in the train wreck that makes me round this movie up to four stars, at which point I am thinking a second-rate version of ""Network"" more than a third-rate version of ""Broadcast News.""  For most of ""Little Black Book"" I was following along as Stacy got herself in deeper and deeper, and it was not until the climax of the film that it dawned on me that I was paying attention to the wrong character.  I fully understand that a lot of people who watch this film are going to be sorry they watched it even once, but I think that if you watch it a second time and think of it as being Barb's movie and not Stacy's then you actually might get more out of it.",4,Is it betrayal when the betrayer is herself betrayed?,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,5494,"['course', 'Little', 'Black', 'Book', 'not',

We are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf (whom he's been w/for at least a year) about his last, one before that, and gf before that.  At least two of them have his home phone number: they've never called? She's never seen the caller ID?  She's never answered the phone? Give me a break!  THen she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms. She meets up with Joyce (the most recent) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes, and starts believing that the bf should really be with her.  Joyce is none the wiser, but if you ask me, Joyce had stalker qualities b/c she harassed him when he was with the model, calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone, keeps that stupid boomerang IN A FRAME, etc.This chick, Stacy (Brittany M) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going. Holly Hunter's character is precisely why I have more male friends than female. Stacy just met this woman and she's revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie. I never expected the 'big climax,' but I did ask myself several times ""will this Barb (HH) chick back the **** off?!""On to the climax:it was actually a surprise, but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for Stacy...after she humiliated all those people. I never got the impression that the bf (Derrick) was cheating on her, yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different.

And Kathy Bates can act up a storm; she plays the role of a reality TV show host and does it up great. I can't say that I recall seeing a movie with Brittany Murphy before, but she plays the lead in this one as a girl who plans and tries to plot out her life to mold things so they will end up a certain way, in an effort to gain certain outcomes.  She sees the results, which in some cases initially look like positives, but might be short-lived ones. And she has to deal with the fallout. Sometimes, she finds out planning can really pay off. I'm being a bit vague here as I don't want to spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it. The movie is funny, is definitely a romantic comedy and I loved the Carly Simon music throughout.

And happy, cos if the guy was that shallow, then he wouldn't be totally worth it.I totally loved this movie. I only really bought it for Brittany Murphy, as she's so cool, and I loved her skirt on the cover of the DVD! I want that skirt! Where's the sun?! I loved how it started off with Carly Simon's ""You're So Vain"", with all her songs (that was the only one I recognised) on the soundtrack, and in one scene, Brittany sings very badly. I can't believe one early reviewer mentioning this was promo for an album! Are you serious?! The girl can't sing!!! And the second song, she was clearly lip-synching along to someone else's voice. Watch out for the cute cute dog as well - so cute it needs to be said twice. He's gorgeous!!!Only one quibble about Brittany - she seems to be shrinking before our very eyes. She was a lot more curvier in Just Married, although not overly curvacious. Now, she's turns sideways, and she could literally disappear.The focus was also very inconsistent, it couldn't decide whether it wanted to focus on the relationship, the girl, the job, Stacey & Barb, or Ira. It also can't decide what kind of movie it is. It's a very realistic view of (American) television, and all the backstabbing etc, that goes on behind the scenes.The finale of the movie ties up a couple of loose ends, but I was left feeling cheated by it at the end. Why wasn't there a nice happy ending?

865212,A1EB6DSPG3NETD,B0006D3HCE,"movieman598 ""Matt""","[3, 5]","Brittany Murphy is excellent in this romantic dramedy about a nice and goodhearted girl who is a disaster waiting to happen. She just got a job as an ascosiate producer at a show called ""Kippie Kann Do!"", which is like a ""Jerry Springer""-type reality show. And she has the perfect boyfriend named Derek that works for a hockey team. She lives in New Jersey and if you wanna be really big, you can't exactly climb your way to Trenton. But, her life may not be so certian after all. She figures out that her boyfriend once dated a slutty and bullimic supermodel named Lulu Fritz. She also finds out that he dated a self-absorbed gynacoligist and a chef who is nice and someone who would definitely become Stacy's friend if she wasn't scamming her.Now, let me say that Little Black Book is definitely something that is great and unexpected. From looks of previews and even the poster, it looks like a zany romantic comedy. But, it touches on deeply felt emotions like trust and betrayl. I think that this is definitely a star-maker for Brittany Murphy because she is a great emotional actress and one other great talent of hers that comes out in this movie is her fantastic singing. In one scene, she is lying on the floor, singing an old Carly Simon song and if you'd never heard of Brittany Murphy, you'll think that she is a singer and this is her first film. But I hope that she breaks into music because she has talent and a good background.Holly Hunter plays Barb, who is a coworker of Stacy's, who is her older and hopefully wiser friend. She helps Stacy through getting the dirt on her boyfriend's secrets and helps her deal with all of this stress that's being put on her because of that. Kathy Bates also has a minimal, but hilarious part as Kippie Kann, the woman who everybody's working for. Kevin Sussman plays Stacy's hypocriticly nuerotic friend Ira. All of the supporting cast is great.The film was written by Melissa Carter and Elisa Bell, who are two young and talented writers. The film is so smart and witty.

Finally, I rented it and it wasn't a disappointment at all. The story is quite basic: Stacy (played by Brittany Murphy) is a TV producer for a well-known talk-show. Things are going great for her, and she doesn't mind that her boyfriend never discusses his old relationships - well, until her new co-worker Barb (Holly Hunter) suggests she should do some research. It's not long before Stacy stumbles upon her boyfriend's little black book, a.k.a. his palm pilot.First of all, ""Little Black Book"" is NOT a regular comedy. Sure, there is plenty of dialogue to keep you smiling and a few laugh-out-loud moments, but the whole concept is just not of the comedic type. At least not in the script, but Murphy's amazing comedic talent (also shown in ""Just Married"") is evident here and it breathes life into the story.Second, ""Little Black Book"" is NOT a ROMANTIC film. It starts off like that, but it crosses the finish line as a coming-of-age story. The publicity for this film didn't do it justice - the trailers showed a hilarious romantic comedy, spoiling all the jokes and sending a wrong impression. This is not, by any means, a perfect movie.

It was both entertaining and thought provoking in that it makes the viewer think about morality---what would I do if in the same situation as the main character in this movie?If you had suspicions about your partner, AND had a job that required you to come up with creative and titillating ideas (talk show associate producer) AND were obsessively curious about your partner's past---what would you do?  Would you violate their privacy, given the incredible pressure to do so, or would you remain ignorant, trust, and come up with an alternate idea for your show?  The show here is a sleezy Jerry-Springer-esque show, just to increase the pressure for the main character, played by Brittany Murphy.The movie was entertaining because of a good performance by Brittany Murphy, and good roles played by the familiar and talented Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates.This is not soley or even mainly a young person's movie, as one might think from the title and DVD cover.  It is in some ways, the modern equivalent of a ""morality play"", and therefore has more to offer than the average DVD rental or purchase.I liked it because it made me think.  And because it was about personal strength, not just a typical romance.  And about truth.The idea person who would enjoy this is probably a middle-aged woman (Carly Simon plays a small but pivotal role in the plot) or anyone who wants to think about her/his role, lifestyle, and morality in modern times.  However, I think men and young people would enjoy it too.  It would be especially beneficial and fun for people of mixed generations to view and discuss their diverse perspectives, which will probably differ by gender, on the choices made by the characters in this movie.You probably can't go wrong by buying or renting ""Little Black Book""; however, I absolutely do not view this movie as appropriate for young people---the moral issues are advanced, plus the sleezy talk shows that the main character works for are realistically portrayed but too tawdry for children to view.****",4,Entertaining and thought provoking,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,2063,"['****I', 'just', 'watched', 'Little', 'Black', 'Book', 'was', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'viewer', 'think', 'morality', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'situation', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'had', 'suspicions', 'partner', 'AND', 'had', 'job', 'required', 'come', 'up', 'creative', 'titillating', 'ideas', 'talk', 'show', 'associate', 'producer', 'were', 'obsessively', 'curious', 'partner', 'past', 'would', 'do', 'Would', 'violate', 'privacy', 'given', 'incredible', 'pressure', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'remain', 'ignorant', 'trust', 'come', 'up', 'alternate', 'idea', 'show', 'show', 'here', 'sleezy', 'Jerry-Springer-esque', 'show', 'just', 'increase', 'pressure', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Brittany', 'Murphy.The', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'good', 'performance', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'good', 'roles', 'played', 'familiar', 'talented', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Kathy', 'Bates.This', 'not', 'soley', 'even', 'mainly', 'young', 'person', 'movie', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'title', 'DVD', 'cover', 'ways', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'morality', 'play', 'therefore', 'more', 'offer', 'average', 'DVD', 'rental', 'purchase.I', 'liked', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'personal', 'strength', 'not', 'just', 'typical', 'romance', 'truth.The', 'idea', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'probably', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role', 'plot', 'anyone', 'who', 'think', 'her/his', 'role', 'lifestyle', 'morality', 'modern', 'times', 'However', 'think', 'men', 'young', 'people', 'would', 'enjoy', 'too', 'would', 'be', 'especially', 'beneficial', 'fun', 'people', 'mixed', 'generations', 'view', 'discuss', 'diverse', 'perspectives', 'will', 'probably', 'differ', 'gender', 'choices', 'made', 'characters', 'movie.You', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'buying', 'renting', 'Little', 'Black', 'Book', 'however', 'absolutely', 'do', 'not', 'view', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'young', 'people', '-the', 'moral', 'issues', 'are', 'advanced', 'sleezy', 'talk', 'main', 'character', 'works', 'are', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'too', 'tawdry', 'children', 'view', '****']",N/A
865220,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0006D3HCE,Only-A-Child,"[1, 2]","A career-girl comedy that lamely morphs into a satirical look at the television industry, ""Little Black Book"" is an uneven fusion of ""American Virgin"", ""Livin' Large"", and ""Broadcast News"" (in fact Holly Hunter looks like she has not aged since playing her Jane Craig role in 1987). Thankfully it is somewhat better than ""American Virgin"" although that is extremely faint praise. There is even a little bit of ""To Die For"" inserted as heroine Stacy Holt (Brittany Murphy) frequently speaks about her dreams of becoming another Diane Sawyer. The real highlight of the movie is the appearance of insurance salesman Ned Ryerson from ""Groundhog Day"", wearing a toupee.There are some good things about ""Little Black Book"". It is somewhat original, although that is largely due to recent introduction of Palm Pilots and etc. as the little black books of the 21st century. Stacy and her boyfriend Derek (Ron Livingston) have good chemistry and Derek's dog (Bob) provides a good excuse for utilizing Murphy's talent for physical comedy. Stacy and Derek have one especially good scene when he discovers and confronts her about snooping through the stuff in his apartment. Julianne Nicholson and Murphy have great chemistry and their scenes together are quite unaffected and real. Nicholson plays a character much like her critically acclaimed Ella Smalley role in ""Tully"". Nicholson underplays nicely yet can be convincingly intense when required.""Little Black Book"" suffers from having Hunter and Murphy as its leads because a viewer can only take so much raspy-voiced dialogue. This is compounded by a scripting that requires a lot of voice-over narration from Murphy. Her raspy disembodied voice is painful but not as painful as listening to Maybelline model Josie Maran attempt an unspecified foreign accent. Maran is great decoration and while she brings far more than Kathy Ireland's constant expression of stunned surprise to her performance, she is not up the task of doing accents. One wonders about the basic competence of director Nick Hurran, how could he listen to something this awful and not pull the plug and allow her to play the character with her normal voice.But the ultimate downfall of ""Little Black Book"" is in the story itself. Despite an endless amount of tedious preaching (mostly on the amorality of the television ratings game), it fails to deliver a consistent or even intelligible message, then it cheats and spits up out of nowhere a moronic happy ending featuring Carly Simon.

Brittney Murphy plays Stacy Holt, a woman who starts dating a guy who she belives is Mr. Right. Then she gets a job as a producer on a talk show. While her boyfriend is out on a bussness trip, she learns he once dated a supermodel. She is upset because he never told her this before. Then she finds his Palm Pilot and through it finds out about his other ex-girlfriends, and decides to learn all about his past life.Even though the main character does some pretty bad things in the film, we can't help but feel sorry for her. Murphy is a very charasmatic actress and I liked her alot in this film. The rest of the cast was also good, and the film has alot of funny moments.

Does it seem as if you are living in a high-tech fish bowl, with details of your personal life available for all the world to see at the click of a button or the tap of a portable touch screen?  If so, you may want to avoid ""Little Black Book,"" a minor league romantic comedy that is guaranteed to have every two-bit Lothario and drugstore Romeo tossing his palm pilot into the nearest handy dumpster.Brittany Murphy stars as Stacy, a pretty young thing from New Jersey who aspires to be nothing less than the Diane Sawyer for the Third Millennium.  Instead, she gets a behind-the-scenes job at a Jerry Springer-type TV talk show hosted by a coldhearted middle-aged shrew played by Kathy Bates.  For some reason, Stacy becomes obsessed with tracking down all of her boyfriend's former flames, using her all-too-willing co-worker (Holly Hunter) to help her do her dirty work.  Seeing as this is the 21st Century, the ""little black book"" that Stacy uses to uncover all these women comes in the form of the young man's palm pilot, replete with enough suggestive photos to make his incrimination for infidelity a virtual fait accompli (at least in the old days, little black books came with stars next to women`s names, not X-rated slide shows).There is a major plot twist near the end of the film that makes some pertinent comments on the voyeuristic cruelty of tabloid television, and we are treated to a genuinely cringe-inducing scene that - for a moment at least - takes the film out of the realm of benign fantasy and plunges it into the muck and mire of real life.  But the sequence really comes too late to redeem the movie as a whole - and everyone, true to form, becomes a better person for the experience at the end.  Stacy seems supremely silly and self-absorbed for long stretches of the movie, and the relationship between her and her man never strikes us as particularly believable or convincing.  Moreover, Murphy doesn't bring much distinction or personality to the role of Stacy, while Holly Hunter has far too much gravitas and talent to be messing around in as lightweight a trifle as this little confection turns out to be.  Julianne Nicholson, on the other hand, lights up the screen as Joyce, the young man's most recent ex-girlfriend whom Stacy meets and discovers she genuinely likes.(The filmmakers do have the good taste to build their soundtrack around perpetually delectable Carly Simon classics, but couldn't they have resisted the temptation to bring the singer out in front of the camera for a truly embarrassment-evoking cameo at the end?)I can't pretend to know how women will react to this film, but I can say that ""Little Black Book"" is sure to give every man who sees it a severe case of the Venus/Mars heebie-jeebies.",2,movie designed to scare men away,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,2846,"['**1/2Has', 'ubiquitous', 'nature', 'technology', 'been', 'making', 'feel', 'wee', 'bit', 'paranoid', 'late', 'seem', 'are', 'living', 'high-tech', 'fish', 'bowl', 'details', 'personal', 'life', 'available', 'world', 'see', 'click', 'button', 'tap', 'portable', 'touch', 'screen', 'so', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'Little', 'Black', 'Book', 'minor', 'league', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'guaranteed', 'have', 'two-bit', 'Lothario', 'drugstore', 'Romeo', 'tossing', 'palm', 'pilot', 'nearest', 'handy', 'dumpster.Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Stacy', 'pretty', 'young', 'thing', 'New', 'Jersey', 'who', 'be', 'nothing', 'less', 'Diane', 'Sawyer', 'Third', 'Millennium', 'Instead', 'behind-the-scenes', 'job', 'Jerry', 'Springer-type', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'hosted', 'coldhearted', 'middle-aged', 'shrew', 'played', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'reason', 'Stacy', 'obsessed', 'tracking', 'down', 'boyfriend', 'former', 'flames', 'using', 'all-too-willing', 'co-worker', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'help', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'Seeing', '21st', 'Century', 'little', 'black', 'book', 'Stacy', 'uncover', 'women', 'form', 'young', 'man', 'palm', 'pilot', 'replete', 'enough', 'suggestive', 'photos', 'make', 'incrimination', 'infidelity', 'virtual', 'fait', 'accompli', 'least', 'old', 'days', 'little', 'black', 'books', 'came', 'stars', 'women', 's', 'names', 'not', 'X-rated', 'slide', 'shows', 'major', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'pertinent', 'comments', 'voyeuristic', 'cruelty', 'tabloid', 'television', 'are', 'treated', 'genuinely', 'cringe-inducing', 'scene', 'moment', 'least', 'film', 'realm', 'benign', 'fantasy', 'muck', 'mire', 'real', 'life', 'sequence', 'really', 'too', 'late', 'redeem', 'movie', 'whole', 'everyone', 'true', 'form', 'better', 'person', 'experience', 'end', 'Stacy', 'supremely', 'silly', 'self-absorbed', 'long', 'stretches', 'movie', 'relationship', 'man', 'never', 'particularly', 'believable', 'convincing', 'Moreover', 'Murphy', ""n't"", 'bring', 'much', 'distinction', 'personality', 'role', 'Stacy', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'gravitas', 'talent', 'be', 'messing', 'around', 'as', 'lightweight', 'trifle', 'little', 'confection', 'out', 'be', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'other', 'hand', 'up', 'screen', 'Joyce', 'young', 'man', 'most', 'recent', 'ex-girlfriend', 'whom', 'Stacy', 'meets', 'discovers', 'genuinely', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'taste', 'build', 'soundtrack', 'perpetually', 'delectable', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'classics', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'resisted', 'temptation', 'bring', 'singer', 'out', 'front', 'camera', 'truly', 'embarrassment-evoking', 'cameo', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'know', 'how', 'women', 'will', 'react', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'Little', 'Black', 'Book', 'sure', 'give', 'man', 'who', 'severe', 'case', 'Venus/Mars', 'heebie-jeebies']",N/A

The difference from these enjoyable films is that despite the presence of eternally lovely Brittany Murphy, you will probably find this 'romantic comedy' very embarrassing.Sad thing is, like his previous sex-changing comedy 'Virtual Sexuality' made five years ago (starring charming Laura Fraser), Nick Hurran's 'Little Black Book' has good if not original premise.  Suppose your girlfriend (named Stacy) can spy into your Palm Pilot, find some recent messages from your ex-girlfriend(s)?  Suppose Stacy is played by Brittany Murphy, who gets more and more obsessed with the idea of finding out the truths, pretending someone else to 'interview' them personally?  And Stacy, a big Carly Simon fan too, happens to be working at a local TV station in New Jersey, dreaming of becomeing a Diane Sawyer?On paper, it looks great.  On screen, it becomes something else.  To me, the film's problem is not Stacy's spying part, which the film managed fairly well with the charms of Brittany Murphy and some slapstick jokes.  I am writing this review from a strictly male viewpoint, but I can understand her behaviors though I don't personally welcome them.No, the problem comes from two Oscar winners, Stacy's mentor at TV station played by Holly Hunter and ""Kippie Kann,"" host of Jerry Springer-type show played by Kathy Bates.  I am not allowed to reveal much here, but I can tell you this much.  'Little Black Book' takes unexpected turn in the second half, in which things get more nasty and incredible.  There is a 'surprise' to Stacy, of which credibility goes far beyond the reach of my understanding of American legal systems.In other words, 'Little Black Book' suddenly becomes a feel-bad movie.  Yes, I know.  Some take it differently, but I insist.  It's a feel-bad film, but how can it be anything else?  When Kathy Bates with heavy make-up gives her worst acting as annoying as anyone in 'Battlefield Earth'?  When the actions of Holly Hunter's character is totally unaccountable?  And most of all, when gifted Brittany Murphy still couldn't find the role made for her?'Little Black Book' starts like romantic comedy, but ends with a feeling like watching Jerry Springer show titled 'I Stalked My Boyfriend's Exes.'
