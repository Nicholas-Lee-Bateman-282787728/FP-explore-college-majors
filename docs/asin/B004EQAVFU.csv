1404501,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B004EQAVFU,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 7]","Never let me go is an odd science fiction film is that it is set in the past instead of the future (strictly speaking, it is set in an alternative universe, but in the fiction the action takes place from a somewhat different 1970s to the 1990s and the clothes and the technologies suggest the action takes place a few decades ago). At the start of the movie, it looks like we have stumble into one of those quaint and boring films set in a traditional English school. But soon more fantastic undertones occur: as the story goes, we are told (this is not a spoiler since it is explained a few minutes into the picture) that these particular children at this school have been destined, without their consent, to give up their organs when they reach adulthood. Without any apparent family (whether they were cloned or how they were born is never told), they have been bred by the government to give their organs several times, so that their untimely death is inevitable. The movie soon centers on three of the children/young adults, two girls and a boy, who know what their ultimate destiny is and try to avoid it (having two beautiful actresses like Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley play the two young women certainly helps the movie). What is never explained here is why they (or other young people in similar situation) don't escape. They don't like their fate, but they seem more resigned to it than they should. Especially, since the movie never shows the country to be a heavily militarized society in which escape to another country would be highly improbable. And in any case if you know your inevitable destiny is untimely and painful death as is it clear here, you would try to get away from this place anyway even if the odds are slim.The movie has many interesting and suggestive themes, but unfortunately it is never able to blend these themes into a very good movie, just an interesting one. And it bothers me a bit that organ's transplants which has saved so many people's lives in the real world, here are made to look so sinister.",3,"Interesting sci fi film, though far from succesful",1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,2046,"['Never', 'let', 'go', 'odd', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'set', 'past', 'instead', 'future', 'strictly', 'speaking', 'set', 'alternative', 'universe', 'fiction', 'action', 'place', 'somewhat', 'different', '1970s', '1990s', 'clothes', 'technologies', 'suggest', 'action', 'place', 'few', 'decades', 'ago', 'start', 'movie', 'have', 'stumble', 'one', 'quaint', 'boring', 'films', 'set', 'traditional', 'English', 'school', 'soon', 'more', 'fantastic', 'undertones', 'occur', 'story', 'are', 'told', 'not', 'spoiler', 'explained', 'few', 'minutes', 'picture', 'particular', 'children', 'school', 'have', 'been', 'destined', 'consent', 'give', 'up', 'organs', 'when', 'reach', 'adulthood', 'apparent', 'family', 'were', 'cloned', 'how', 'were', 'born', 'never', 'told', 'have', 'been', 'bred', 'government', 'give', 'organs', 'several', 'times', 'untimely', 'death', 'inevitable', 'movie', 'soon', 'centers', 'three', 'children/young', 'adults', 'two', 'girls', 'boy', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'ultimate', 'destiny', 'try', 'avoid', 'having', 'two', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'play', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'certainly', 'movie', 'What', 'never', 'explained', 'here', 'why', 'other', 'young', 'people', 'similar', 'situation', 'do', ""n't"", 'escape', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fate', 'seem', 'more', 'resigned', 'should', 'Especially', 'movie', 'never', 'country', 'be', 'heavily', 'militarized', 'society', 'escape', 'country', 'would', 'be', 'highly', 'improbable', 'case', 'know', 'inevitable', 'destiny', 'untimely', 'painful', 'death', 'clear', 'here', 'would', 'try', 'get', 'away', 'place', 'anyway', 'even', 'odds', 'are', 'slim.The', 'movie', 'many', 'interesting', 'suggestive', 'themes', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'able', 'blend', 'themes', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'interesting', 'one', 'bit', 'organ', 'transplants', 'saved', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'lives', 'real', 'world', 'here', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'so', 'sinister']",N/A
1404502,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004EQAVFU,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Coming into this viewing experience I was expecting brilliance.  Yes, I had read the reviews and I had heard the mixed responses, but truth be told I really expected BRILLIANCE.  Sure, a lot of that comes from the fact that the novel was a stunning portrait of growth and adolescence and life lessons and I was hoping (praying, crossing fingers) that the film would follow suit.It doesn't quite do that.The story told is that of a group of clones who grow up with the knowledge that their whole purpose in life is to supply their `originals' with valuable organs at the time needed.  The focal point of the story is on the love triangle that forms between Katie, Ruth and Tommy.  Growing up together at Hailsham, the three friends go through many changes that shape them, for better and worse.  Of course, their life must come to `completion' as they start caring for donors and then eventually donating themselves.I'm just going to get right into my issues.  I may have actually liked this film a little more had I NOT read the novel, but my biggest pet-peeve here is the fact that the film omits some serious plot embellishments that the novel weaves so beautifully into the prose.  Without those moments, those lost conversations and glances, the film loses a bit of its heartfelt core.  That isn't to say that the film doesn't deliver in the sympathetic department, but the lack of follow-through on some of the plot developments left the film feeling a little thin.  It just doesn't `go there' or at least not `all the way there' like it could have, especially with a subject this controversially intriguing.While I loved some of the directorial choices (I am not one for narration, but Mulligan's was astonishingly well placed) I found some of the script work to feel rushed and underdeveloped.  There were so many small facets from the novel that were nonexistent here, facets that would have certainly helped flesh out the characters.Sadly, the rushed feel to the film leaves the ending conclusion feeling uneven.But, where there are negative things to be said, there are also some positive.  Carey Mulligan makes good on the promise she made with last years `An Education' by delivering a beautifully in tone performance that digs deeper than the script initially allows.  She tries to hand us Katie on a platter, uncovering her darkest secrets, and even though her ending resolutions don't quite feel heavy enough, it is solely the fault of the script and the films direction; not her performance.  Keira Knightley is slightly uneven, but when she delivers she delivers quite nicely (her breakdowns are legitimately felt).  UGH, another pet peeve is the handling of Ruth.  When I read the novel I really felt that Knightley was going to WIN the Oscar because that role was just so baity.  After watching the film it is obvious why she wasn't even in contention this year.  The film fails to really flesh her out the way the novel does.  You interest does not fall on her, like it does when reading the novel.  The film is far fonder of Katie and Tommy.  Speaking of Tommy, Andrew Garfield is astonishingly good here.  This guy, I mean where has he been?  This year is the year of Garfield (that Oscar snub stings more and more every day).  Between this and `The Social Network', he is the highlight of the year for me.  The way he molds Tommy is so effortless, so moving.  It is such a quiet performance, one that is almost unnoticed until that last moment when he just collapses.  That moment on the couch when life leaves him and you see his face turn every shade by the natural one; it is just flawless.But, enough gushing over a film that just doesn't truly deserve it.  I mean, outside of a beautifully manipulative score (some gawk, but it really works), some intriguing camera work and Garfield's Oscar worthy performance, `Never Let Me Go' fails to make a mark strong enough for us to hold on.We don't resist letting go; it just seems right.",3,I'll never let go; err...,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,3959,"['Coming', 'viewing', 'experience', 'was', 'expecting', 'brilliance', 'Yes', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'had', 'heard', 'mixed', 'responses', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'really', 'expected', 'BRILLIANCE', 'Sure', 'lot', 'fact', 'novel', 'was', 'stunning', 'portrait', 'growth', 'adolescence', 'life', 'lessons', 'was', 'hoping', 'praying', 'crossing', 'fingers', 'film', 'would', 'follow', 'suit.It', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'that.The', 'story', 'told', 'group', 'clones', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'knowledge', 'whole', 'purpose', 'life', 'supply', 'originals', 'valuable', 'organs', 'time', 'needed', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'love', 'triangle', 'Katie', 'Ruth', 'Tommy', 'Growing', 'up', 'together', 'Hailsham', 'three', 'friends', 'go', 'many', 'changes', 'shape', 'better', 'worse', 'course', 'life', 'must', 'come', 'completion', 'start', 'caring', 'donors', 'then', 'eventually', 'donating', 'themselves.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'get', 'right', 'issues', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'liked', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'had', 'NOT', 'read', 'novel', 'biggest', 'pet-peeve', 'here', 'fact', 'film', 'serious', 'plot', 'embellishments', 'novel', 'weaves', 'so', 'beautifully', 'prose', 'moments', 'lost', 'conversations', 'glances', 'film', 'bit', 'heartfelt', 'core', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'sympathetic', 'department', 'lack', 'follow-through', 'plot', 'developments', 'left', 'film', 'feeling', 'little', 'thin', 'just', ""n't"", 'go', 'least', 'not', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'especially', 'subject', 'controversially', 'intriguing.While', 'loved', 'directorial', 'choices', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'narration', 'Mulligan', 'was', 'astonishingly', 'well', 'placed', 'found', 'script', 'work', 'feel', 'rushed', 'underdeveloped', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'small', 'facets', 'novel', 'were', 'nonexistent', 'here', 'facets', 'would', 'have', 'certainly', 'helped', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters.Sadly', 'rushed', 'feel', 'film', 'ending', 'conclusion', 'feeling', 'uneven.But', 'where', 'are', 'negative', 'things', 'be', 'said', 'are', 'also', 'positive', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'good', 'promise', 'made', 'last', 'years', 'Education', 'delivering', 'beautifully', 'tone', 'performance', 'deeper', 'script', 'initially', 'hand', 'Katie', 'platter', 'uncovering', 'darkest', 'secrets', 'even', 'ending', 'resolutions', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'feel', 'heavy', 'enough', 'solely', 'fault', 'script', 'films', 'direction', 'not', 'performance', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'slightly', 'uneven', 'when', 'quite', 'nicely', 'breakdowns', 'are', 'legitimately', 'felt', 'UGH', 'pet', 'peeve', 'handling', 'Ruth', 'When', 'read', 'novel', 'really', 'felt', 'Knightley', 'was', 'going', 'WIN', 'Oscar', 'role', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'baity', 'watching', 'film', 'obvious', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'contention', 'year', 'film', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'way', 'novel', 'interest', 'not', 'fall', 'when', 'reading', 'novel', 'film', 'far', 'fonder', 'Katie', 'Tommy', 'Speaking', 'Tommy', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'here', 'guy', 'mean', 'where', 'been', 'year', 'year', 'Garfield', 'Oscar', 'snub', 'stings', 'more', 'more', 'day', 'Between', 'Social', 'Network', 'highlight', 'year', 'way', 'Tommy', 'so', 'effortless', 'so', 'moving', 'such', 'quiet', 'performance', 'one', 'almost', 'unnoticed', 'last', 'moment', 'when', 'just', 'moment', 'couch', 'when', 'life', 'see', 'face', 'turn', 'shade', 'natural', 'one', 'just', 'flawless.But', 'enough', 'gushing', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'truly', 'deserve', 'mean', 'beautifully', 'manipulative', 'score', 'gawk', 'really', 'intriguing', 'camera', 'work', 'Garfield', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'fails', 'make', 'mark', 'strong', 'enough', 'hold', 'on.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'resist', 'letting', 'go', 'just', 'right']",N/A

1404507,A30TQET02FLSUX,B004EQAVFU,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[30, 35]","MOVIE RATING:  4 stars  B+ )Never Let Me Go (2010) is one of those small, well-crafted indie films that typically only diehard cinephiles seek out and appreciate. But the rewards for that search are well worth the effort here. It's a science-fiction film in the very broadest sense of the genre, but to me it's really just an existential coming-of-age love story within a vague sci-fi like framework. And when I say sci-fi, I mean in terms of a movie like Gattaca (1997), a fantastic, futuristic, character-driven, but vaguely sci-fi film. Never Let Me Go is much less sci-fi than Gattaca, but I think if you appreciate and like Gattaca, then you might appreciate and like Never Let Me Go.There are a few movies that I was strongly reminded of while watching Never Let Me Go: Dead Poets Society (1989), Gattaca (1997), and A Single Man (2009). I think the mid-20th century boarding school feel of Never Let Me go, at least in it's first act, is what reminded me so strongly of Dead Poets Society. But as the film plays out, it reminds me more of Gattaca and A Single Man. All three of these films deal with the topic of ""completion"" (i.e. death), in similar ways to this one. There's a strong sense of sacrifice that comes with suicidal death in all four films, but each takes a slightly different look at the topic.The story of Never Let Me Go is centered around Kathy (played byCarey Mulligan and Izzy Meikle-Small), Ruth (played by Keira Knightley and Ella Purnell), and Tommy (played by Andrew Garfield andCharlie Rowe), who are human ""clones"" living purely to be future organ donors for ""real"" people. These three characters, along with hundreds and probably thousands of others, are raised in boarding schools around England without parents. Instead, teachers or guardians take care of raising and educating them, telling them as little as possible about the real world outside of the school (which feels more like a juvenile detention facility or prison). The kid clones only know what they need to, so that they understand, internalize and embrace their limited ""special"" life purpose and nothing more. It's a chilling scenario because these kids are all going to grow up just to give themselves over to die (or ""complete"" as it is called in the film). They are brainwashed from birth that they are simply living organ donations...nothing more...and that they are special because of that.Never Let Me Go is a movie that really asks two key existential/spiritual questions: What makes us human? And why are we living? By looking at these questions through the abbreviated lives and experiences of these three cloned humans, we get this sort of abstract overall view of ourselves through their eyes. Is it love that makes us human? Is it sex that makes us human? Is it friendship that makes us human? Is it art that makes us human? Is it self-awareness that makes us human? These are answers to these core questions, along with many more, that the film ponders in a subtle way. The film doesn't really give answers as much as it asks the questions and allows the viewer to come to their own answers, if any, through the characters and their journeys. I like that the filmmakers here have left us with open-ended questions because it gives the movie something to continually look at over the course of my own life as I watch the film again.I've listened to podcasts with writer Kazuo Ishiguro (who wrote the novel that this film is based on), screenwriter Alex Garland, and director Mark Romanek, and they all confirm that this film is really just a vehicle for looking at life in general and what it means for us to be living. It's a story of what it's like to be human. But because we are so self-aware, we often times have to see our lives through the lives of others to really see ourselves. And that is what cinema is all about in my mind. It's a vehicle for reflection...it's a mirror. Sometimes the mirror is ornated and jewel-encrusted, and other times it is plain and simple, like it is here. Kathy, Ruth & Tommy are trying to find the meaning in their short lives as clones, which they are told is their life purpose, just as we are trying to find the meaning and purpose in our lives as humans.By having Kathy, Ruth & Tommy live shortened lives due to their planned organ donations, they have to deal with the issues of mortality and purpose early in their life. And  they arrive at acceptance of their mortality in a quicker and more finite amount of time. Their lives are truncated, so they get to what's important in life faster than the rest of us. We typically linger through three of the clones' lifetimes before getting to where they get much earlier.While Never Let Me Go is a bit slow in its pacing and editing at times, stumbling along the way, the movie really grabbed me internally after I left the theater and it has stayed in my mind ever since then. I think the story could have been told in a more engaging manner, but I give it credit for sinking its claws into me and not letting go. I can't say enough about the quality of the acting by the three leads. Knightly, Garfield, and Mulligan all really show their talents as up and coming actors in this feature.The production design and cinematography on the film are both beautiful and appropriate for the story. While we don't really know if we're in the past or the future, the sort of 1960s to 1970s look and feel of Never Let Me Go worked for me to create an interesting context for the story to occur in. Rachel Portman's score has a beautifully quiet tone throughout the movie and it lends just the right emotional queues when necessary. I've listened to the score a dozen or more times on its own, and I really appreciate what Portman did here. She captured the existential questioning of the story in her score and every time I hear it, I think of the movie.Never Let Me Go is a character-driven dramatic film with a lot of psychological depth to it. While on the surface it seems to have very few emotions throughout it, the emotions are there and they build-up to a satisfying ending for me. I think the film's lack of box office success is not due to the film itself as much as its due to the subject matter. Never Let Me Go is not an escapist movie by any means. So it's appeal to the general public is probably limited. It's a movie where you go to find out who your are internally and deal with those key questions in life that most people don't want to deal with.

The first time I saw it, I came into it about 15 minutes late but it caught my attention and I stayed with it. The second time was to see the first 15 minutes I'd missed and then watched the entire thing again...the third time just now. Some of the objections brought up by reviewers seem to be by people who want logic in what is an unlogical world. Why didn't they just walk away and (SPOILERS) avoid their destiny? They were conditioned, entirely conditioned, to fulfill a destiny. The conditioning was so strong that they never considered the possibility of walking away. In a very real sense, they never grew up - they remained quite immature in their understanding of choices and taking chances and how the world might work more in their favor, other than pursuing deferments, which, of course, never existed......Andrew Garfield's acting brought me to tears, especially his sensitivity and the painful realization that the powers-that-be would question that they had souls....that they were disposable....and the scream of pure agony towards the end of the movie...Carey Mulligan was subtle in her acting and all the more heartbreaking because of it. Keira Knightly seemed to be perfect for the part she played but she reminded me much of herself in other movies....This most definitely is not a movie to be taken lightly.  It bears looking at because it questions what life is.  In this brave new world, when cloning is becoming a reality, how would we feel or deal with the moral issues concerning bringing a life into this world only to harvest its organs?  Would ""it"" have feelings? Would ""it"" want a life of its own?  Would we me ""murdering"" when we harvest?  What if we only clone an organ? How much different is that? It is, after all, only a liver, maybe. It wouldn't have feelings....I may take this too far but these are things that this movie made me consider.On another note, the music is heartbreaking and matches the movie exactly.

But nothing had prepared me for the horror waiting in the alternate 1970s England where Never Let Me Go takes place.The idea of raising (growing is a more likely description of the process) children with the only purpose of harvesting their organs is repulsive. And yet in this world, apparently, nobody questions the morality of doing so because these children are not thought to have a soul.Because we are introduced to the children singing and attending classes and playing in their bucolic British boarding school, behaving in every way as children do, before being told (early in the movie, so this is not a big spoiler) what their purpose is, the revelation is shocking. For us, that is.But the teachers, except one who is quickly fired, don't question this. Neither do the children. They believe what they are told, whether this be that if they run after a ball beyond the school boundaries their hands and feet will be cut off or that, when they are in their twenties, they are to give their organs to others as needed.The movie does not question whether this is acceptable, but follows Kathy, Tommy and Ruth first as children, then as teens. Kathy who tells the story is not bitter, or angry and doesn't, even once, rebels against her fate.I was stunned.What kind of society is this that sees children as parts and believe they don't have a soul?And yet...It wasn't so long ago that Freud and his pals argued that women did not have souls. Not so long ago that Hitler sent Jews to extermination camps, that slavery was allowed and people of color sold and treated like animals.So maybe this story is not so farfetched. Which makes it even more horrifying.Are we humans really this cluelessly cruel?Never Let Me Go is a breathtakingly beautiful movie and, despite or maybe because its harrowing subject, life affirming.P.S.

1404518,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004EQAVFU,Chris Pandolfi,"[57, 65]","Walking out of ""Never Let Me Go,"" I felt as if I had experienced a death. This isn't to suggest that the film pushed me away. If anything, I was deeply drawn in, entirely taken by the sheer power it had on me emotionally. I'm fairly certain I wasn't the only one; I sensed solemnity in the audience I sat with, the profound feelings of shock, loss, grief, anger, and helplessness. The film projects all that, as if saying, ""It's not fair. It shouldn't have to be this way."" At the same time, the film also projects profound feelings of resignation, as if saying, ""Life isn't fair, and it doesn't matter what should or shouldn't be - that's just the way it is."" Perhaps so, but that doesn't make it any easier. This movie haunted me, and I don't mean that I was frightened or repulsed; its themes, its characters, and its plot have a lasting effect, the ability to move us in the most personal of ways.Adapted from the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro (best known for ""The Remains of the Day""), ""Never Let Me Go"" takes place in an alternate universe, where medical science achieved what was thought to be impossible; in 1952, all previously incurable diseases could be cured, allowing for the average life expectancy to increase to over 100 years by 1967. But how did such a thing happen? The opening title card is intentionally vague on the specifics - all it says is that it was the result of a ""medical breakthrough."" With that in mind, we plunge into the story proper, which begins in 1978 at Hailsham, a charming-looking but isolated British boarding school surrounded by miles of open fields. The children and teenagers who attend know absolutely nothing of the outside world. They wouldn't dream of leaving; they've all heard horror stories about those who have crossed over the fence.They've also heard repeatedly from headmistress Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) that they're all special. What exactly does this mean? We gradually come to understand, although hints are dropped all throughout the opening section. Consider the fact that every student wears a special bracelet, one they must pass over a mechanical device whenever they reenter the school building. Also consider that every student has no last name other than an initial. And then consider a lecture given by the ever observant Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins), one in which she sorrowfully explains to the students that, while most children can grow up and be anything they want, they will never be anything; their paths have already been chosen for them. Do the students understand this? They may hear the words, but I imagine it would be difficult for them to fully grasp their meaning, especially when the only world they've ever known has been the grounds of a boarding school.Emphasis is placed on artistic achievement, specifically poetry, drama, music, and - most importantly - drawing and painting. The best pieces are chosen by an elusive figure known as Madame to be displayed a section of the school called The Gallery. They're encouraged to participate in sports and eat a healthy diet. They earn colored tokens, each having monetary value; every so often, they can use their tokens to buy assorted knick knacks, all delivered to Hailsham via truck.Three students are introduced: Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy. As adolescents (played by Isobel Meikle-Small, Ella Purnell, and Charlie Rowe respectively), they dutifully engage in strict regiment, although they also develop as individuals, forming a close friendship in spite of the cliques students are often separated by. Kathy is observant and calm. Ruth is bold and opinionated. Tommy is a shy boy who isn't as creatively inclined and is picked on by other boys. As adults in 1985 (played by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield respectively), tensions rise when they're sent to a residential community that grants them more exposure to the outside world; not only do they not know how to cope in such a place (they're incapable, for example, of deciding for themselves what to order in a restaurant), they're also at odds over their needs and desires, Tommy's physical attraction to Ruth seemingly upstaged by his emotional attraction to Kathy.The film ends in 1994, at which point Kathy has become a Carer and has been separated from Ruth and Tommy for years. I dare not reveal what a Carer is, nor should I say anything more about Ruth and Tommy, for their fates are too attached to the secret the story revolves around. It's revealed not as a surprise twist but rather as a disturbingly slow unfolding of events, all of which lead to a devastating conclusion. This in itself very easily could have been weepy and melodramatic, but director Mark Romanek and screenwriter Alex Garland instead opted to handle it with a fascinating sense of acceptance - sad, but inescapable, like death. Therein lies the tragedy of ""Never Let Me Go""; it's about the certainty of one's existence, the inability to alter the outcome, the painful moments of letting illusions go and facing reality.",4,Children with Special Deeds,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,5012,"['Walking', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'felt', 'had', 'experienced', 'death', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'film', 'pushed', 'away',

I'm afraid to put in any spoilers. But there were at least two instances where things came right out of the blue as if the author thought of them at that moment, when if they were that important, they would have been mentioned earlier in the story as the characters would have been thinking about them earlier. Really, there seemed to be several things like that.Perhaps in the book everything is handled better and the filmmakers really screwed it up. So my recommendation is read the book first.

The story centers around three primary characters, Kathy, the teller, and her two best friends, Tommy and Ruth.Of course the reader will eventually place all the pieces of these intricate and detailed reminiscences together and figure out that all of these children have been cloned for the express purpose of harvesting their organs...one at a time, until they die.  This is done when they become older and of age.Now some have classified this work as Science Fiction.  That would be an unfair assessment and could be likened to classifying `1984.' or `Brave New World,"" as Science Fiction. No, this work falls more or less into the category of social observations...what if scenario...not really a futuristic society, but rather a society that simply is; in this day and time...speculative fiction I suppose you could call it.It is interesting to note that one once has the film offered the opinion of the rightness or wrongness of the situation.  It has merely laid out the story and lets the reader shudder and become rather ill when they realize what is happening and allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions.  The filming style is extremely detailed, dealing with emotions, facts and speculation and is filled with instances of digression; a method of telling the story I find extremely appealing and fits my taste in reading perfectly.  Some find this cumbersome and a bit boring...I do not.  I think the author's prose is beautiful and it is extremely thought provoking.I found myself becoming extremely emotional while watching this work and admit that it touched me.  Much has been written as to the fact that many feel it is unbelievable that the characters in this work can accept their fate, not make any great attempts to ""escape"" and accept their lot in life (for the most part) as natural.  I personally found this aspect of the work to be spot on and feel the author was making some very good points here.  All of us, in one way or another, accept social norms and accept our particular lot in life.  We like to tell ourselves differently, but for the most part it is true.  History pretty well teachers us that the majority of mankind, down through the ages, has been pretty sheep like in their obedience to social norms. Think about it.  It has happened in the past and is still happening to us today when we kid ourselves, believing that we are too smart and too sophisticated to fall into such a trap.  No, for me, the premise of the story is all too believable...which sort of makes me scared and sad at the same time.Please do not that there are not explosions, car chases, desperate and exciting scenes of escape efforts, no violence, no special effects.  This is a thinking film and to be quite frank, one of the most horrifying films I have seen in years.I also might suggest that you read the book on which this work was based.  Like the movie, it is truly a haunting story.Like this film or hate this film, I seriously doubt that any viewer will not remember this one long after it has been read.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,A TOUCHING AND HAUNTING MOVIE.

They are brought up -- cultivated like greenhouse plants, really -- in isolation to be proud of their mission in life, which is to donate their organs so that ""real people"" may live long lives.It seems perfectly natural to dehumanize other people and to anthropomorphize our pets.  We want without guilt to perceive others as sinful or alien, or to exploit them as servants or workers.  We also wish for the pure affection that curdles so easily among people, but that seems forever innocent between owner and animal.  (Good doggie!)It is easy for a Westerner to feel reassured that this sci-fi story of self-sacrificial, social engineering comes out of japan, the nation that invented the suicide-bomber (remember the kamikazes?), and in which workers seem willing to sacrifice themselves to shut down a nuclear power plant.  And yet, those with power in the West as well as in the East can still treat annoying or useful other classes or races as sub-human, and still breed young people to risk noble, self-sacrifice in military service.The very Western twist in this tale is that the doomed children come to believe that if couples truly love each other, they can prove that they have souls, and induce the parent-figures at the school to grant them a few extra years of life.  Cannot love conquer all, or at least fight reality to a draw?  Cannot their true love for each other prove that even clones can have souls?This movie moves beautifully, slowly, and gracefully across the decades, unfolding like Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"".

And, like Gilliam's Brazil, Romanek's Never Let Me Go is an act of nostalgia itself; Gilliam's film is nostalgic for the 1940's & Romanek's film is nostalgic for the 1970's. Both directors explore/re-visit cultural terrain that is familiar to them & that they are fond of, but they also use the time period that they are nostalgic for to track the beginnings of current trends.Both films invite us to think about a world that is becoming more & more controlled by an overly bureaucratized state & an omnipresent commercial media & for both filmmakers the result of this state of things is that life feels less & less authentic & less & less real.But there the comparisons end & each film explores these themes in highly distinctive ways. Brazil belongs to a tradition that include both the Kafka-esque & the Monty Python-esque. Never Let Me Go belongs to a slightly older tradition that includes the Victorian novel & theatre (both of which explore the psychic affects of an oppressive social order--an order where a working class majority serves an aristocratic minority).Brazil is a manic & quirky cult classic; Never Let Me Go, with its young stars & lush cinematography, is much more aesthetically pleasing (as many period films are) & in many ways more conventional than Brazil, but its fascinating to view these two films that deal with such similar content in such unique ways together.",4,A Search for the Real,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,1519,"['1985', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'film', 'Brazil', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'title', 'sickly', 'sweet', 'nostalgic', 'song', 'Gilliam', 'Brazil', 'Romanek', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'act', 'nostalgia', 'Gilliam', 'film', 'nostalgic', '1940', 'Romanek', 'film', 'nostalgic', '1970', 'directors', 'explore/re-visit', 'cultural', 'terrain', 'familiar', 'are', 'fond', 'also', 'use', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'nostalgic', 'track', 'beginnings', 'current', 'trends.Both', 'films', 'invite', 'think', 'world', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'controlled', 'overly', 'bureaucratized', 'state', 'omnipresent', 'commercial', 'media', 'filmmakers', 'result', 'state', 'things', 'life', 'feels', 'less', 'less', 'authentic', 'less', 'less', 'real.But', 'there', 'comparisons', 'end', 'film', 'themes', 'highly', 'distinctive', 'ways', 'Brazil', 'tradition', 'include', 'Kafka-esque', 'Monty', 'Python-esque', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'slightly', 'older', 'tradition', 'Victorian', 'novel', 'theatre', 'explore', 'psychic', 'affects', 'oppressive', 'social', 'order', 'order', 'where', 'working', 'class', 'majority', 'aristocratic', 'minority', '.Brazil', 'manic', 'quirky', 'cult', 'classic', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'young', 'stars', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'much', 'more', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'many', 'period', 'films', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'conventional', 'Brazil', 'fascinating', 'view', 'two', 'films', 'deal', 'such', 'similar', 'content', 'such', 'unique', 'ways', 'together']",N/A

I don't intend to write a full review of the entire film, but I felt such a distinctive array of emotions while watching it that I wanted to write something.This is a sci-fi movie about cloning, although it is ""sci fi"" in that aspect only,I know I think of futuristic robots and spaceships and whatnot when sci fi comes to mind. This movie is set in a boarding school in the English countryside of all places, which I believe to be the most atypical setting for a sci fi film I can think of.The subject matter reminds me a lot of a movie from a few years back, ""The Island"", starring Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor. In that movie, the stars realize that they are clones being groomed and maintained for organ harvesting as needed later down the road by their wealthy originals. That movie is set in the future- I think 2050?""Never let me go"" is set in the mid twentieth century, which is part of what makes it so astonishing. Life expectancy has risen to beyond 100 years thanks to the advent of boarding schools that raise clone children to be smart, responsible and civilized beings that will donate all their vital organs later down the road through a series of surgeries. Little mention is made of the scientific aspect of the cloning or how it is accomplished, which would be boring anyway. The film focuses entirely on a group of these kids as they grow up.  When an outsider tells a group of the children, aged 8 or so, that their sole purpose in life will be to provide organs for regular people that need them, they are shocked.The film then fast forwards about a decade and focuses on the same group of kids.  They are now coming of age, and living in a big old farm house, where they pretty much sit around and spend their time as they please. For the most part they are completely resolved to their fate.  This total acceptance of their sad lot in life gave me the most overwhelming feeling of sadness.  This is in such stark contrast to what you typically expect to find in a movie where the subjects know they face such a tragic fate.  These clones understand their fate and have no plans to try to escape it. They are not even locked up, they are pretty much free to come and go as they please, as long as they scan their wrist monitor for tracking purposes.There is some talk amongst the young adults about the possibility of having the harvesting delayed if they can prove to the powers that be that they are in love. Some of the kids disspell this notion as only a rumor, but most secretly hold out hope  that there is truth to it.As the clones reach their early twenties, they begin to be called for surgeries for organ donation.  They often survive two or three of these surgeries before they ""complete"" (die).  The clones have various ailments as each surgery passes, they show one young girl that had one of her eyes removed in a past surgery. Keira Knightley cannot walk without a cane. There is a scene where Keira Knightley is undergoing her third surgery. As they pull out her organs, the monitor beeps loudly to indicate that she has expired...they show the cold, callous medical staff simply continue to remove her organs and not even attempt to revive her. This is such a powerful scene.That is really all I wanted to say about this film.  I don't know if I felt particularly connected with the characters themselves.  For me the amazing part of this film was watching these poor young people accept their fate and live their lives as creatures of science, bred for the pure purpose of organ harvesting.

1404540,A15XNT79BMHKXN,B004EQAVFU,"googleit ""movie buff""","[19, 22]","This movie brings up many philosophical questions about life, death, love, and what it means to be human.  It leaves itself open to many interpretations, and will leave you thinking about the larger meanings and messages long after the film is ended.****ALERT - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!****First off, I think one main message of the film is about how certain forgotten classes of people are used and tossed aside by the rest of us, to make our lives more luxurious or comfortable.  The only way we can manage to live with the knowledge that we are profiting off this exploitation, is to pretend these people don't exist.  We know there is child labor, and sweatshops, and that many of our clothes/sneakers/electronics are made in 3rd-world factories in borderline slave conditions, often by children who have no hope for a better life.  But we push this inconvenient truth out of our minds in order to enjoy the luxuries these forgotten people make possible.  It was interesting that in the film, almost every ""regular"" person who came in contact with the schoolchildren (deliverymen, maintenance workers, etc.), seemed very uncomfortable around them and wanted to avoid interaction with them.  They did not want to be reminded of the cost innocent people are paying for their longevity.I also found it interesting that you almost never saw the beneficiaries of the Donor's sacrifice.  They lived in an alternate universe where the organs they needed just appeared - the messiness and horror of the process was hidden from them.  One very brief but telling scene is when the children were all in a restaurant laughing loudly, and an older couple at a nearby table looks at them with disgust and annoyance.  These are the very same people who will likely live a long life thanks to the ultimate sacrifice of the ""annoying"" young people.I also found the issue of the ""Deferrals"" to be full of philosophical significance.  In essence I think Ishiguro is making a comment about death, and how we all bargain for more time with the ones we love.  Interestingly, in the film the deferrals turn out to be nothing but a false rumor, a children's fairytale.  I think perhaps the author is making a comment on belief in the afterlife... we all want to believe that death is not the end, that we will see our loved ones in the afterlife.  After all, if our love is true enough, justice MUST dictate that we get more time with them.  Is there any basis in truth to this belief?  Or, are we like the kids at Hailsham - desperately believing a made-up story?Of course, the film makes it clear from the very 1st scene that deferrals are false - we see Tommy clearly about to reach ""completion"" even as the opening credits roll, so we know there will be no happy ending for he and Kathy.  So the viewer is not surprised by the revelation late in the film that there are no deferrals.  What is touching, however, is the childlike hope with which Tommy and Kathy cling to this dream of more time together.  One of the most moving parts of the film is when we realize that Kathy, always the more grounded one, has just realized there are no deferrals - even as Tommy still clings to his hope.  Carey Mulligan does wonders with the smallest of expressions in this scene.Also on the subject of the afterlife, in the final scene when Kathy looks across the field, she imagines seeing Tommy running across to her.  This is clearly a reference to the standard Hollywood version of two lovers reuniting in the afterlife.  We've seen this type of ""happy ending"" so often in movies, that we almost expect to see him come running over the horizon.  But tellingly, he never does - and Kathy never even allows the fantasy to progress to the point where they actually embrace.  The thought of something that she knows will never happen is too painful.  There is no more time.  There is no deferral.  All she will ever have is the brief time they had together.So in the end I think this is a movie about life - specifically, the blink-of-an-eye flash of time we all get on this earth.  Anyone who has been truly in love will know that no amount of years will ever be enough.  We all want a deferral, and would give almost anything for one.  In fact, the people in this fictional society in effect bargain their humanity away in exchange for their own deferrals - they allow innocent young people to suffer and die in exchange for their own ""deferrals"".  But in the end, deferral or not, ""completion"" comes for us all, and too soon. All we can do is appreciate every moment, and respect all of our fellow humans, and never let each other go.",4,"Moving meditation on death, love, and what it means to be human",1301616000,"04 1, 2011",2011,4607,"['movie', 'up', 'many', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'open', 'many', 'interpretations', 'will', 'leave', 'thinking', 'larger', 'meanings', 'messages', 'long', 'film', 'ended', '****ALERT', 'MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', '****First', 'off', 'think', 'one', 'main', 'message', 'film', 'how', 'certain', 'forgotten', 'classes', 'people', 'are', 'used', 'tossed', 'aside', 'rest', 'make', 'lives', 'more', 'luxurious', 'comfortable', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'manage', 'live', 'knowledge', 'are', 'profiting', 'off', 'exploitation', 'pretend', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'know', 'child', 'labor', 'sweatshops', 'many', 'clothes/sneakers/electronics', 'are', 'made', '3rd-world', 'factories', 'borderline', 'slave', 'conditions', 'often', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'hope', 'better', 'life', 'push', 'inconvenient', 'minds', 'order', 'enjoy', 'luxuries', 'forgotten', 'people', 'make', 'possible', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'almost', 'regular', 'person', 'who', 'came', 'contact', 'schoolchildren', 'deliverymen', 'maintenance', 'workers', 'etc', 'seemed', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'interaction', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'reminded', 'cost', 'innocent', 'people', 'are', 'paying', 'longevity.I', 'also', 'found', 'interesting', 'almost', 'never', 'saw', 'beneficiaries', 'Donor', 'sacrifice', 'lived', 'alternate', 'universe', 'where', 'organs', 'needed', 'just', 'appeared', 'messiness', 'horror', 'process', 'was', 'hidden', 'One', 'very', 'brief', 'telling', 'scene', 'when', 'children', 'were', 'restaurant', 'laughing', 'loudly', 'older', 'couple', 'nearby', 'table', 'looks', 'disgust', 'annoyance', 'are', 'very', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'likely', 'live', 'long', 'life', 'thanks', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'annoying', 'young', 'people.I', 'also', 'found', 'issue', 'Deferrals', 'be', 'full', 'philosophical', 'significance', 'essence', 'think', 'Ishiguro', 'making', 'comment', 'death', 'how', 'bargain', 'more', 'time', 'ones', 'love', 'Interestingly', 'film', 'deferrals', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'false', 'rumor', 'children', 'fairytale', 'think', 'perhaps', 'author', 'making', 'comment', 'belief', 'afterlife', 'want', 'believe', 'death', 'not', 'end', 'will', 'see', 'loved', 'ones', 'afterlife', 'love', 'true', 'enough', 'justice', 'MUST', 'dictate', 'get', 'more', 'time', 'there', 'basis', 'truth', 'belief', 'are', 'kids', 'Hailsham', 'desperately', 'believing', 'made-up', 'story', 'course', 'film', 'clear', 'very', '1st', 'scene', 'deferrals', 'are', 'false', 'see', 'Tommy', 'clearly', 'reach', 'completion', 'even', 'opening', 'credits', 'roll', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'Kathy', 'viewer', 'not', 'surprised', 'revelation', 'late', 'film', 'are', 'deferrals', 'What', 'touching', 'however', 'childlike', 'hope', 'Tommy', 'Kathy', 'cling', 'dream', 'more', 'time', 'together', 'One', 'most', 'moving', 'parts', 'film', 'when', 'realize', 'Kathy', 'always', 'more', 'grounded', 'one', 'just', 'realized', 'are', 'deferrals', 'even', 'Tommy', 'still', 'hope', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'wonders', 'smallest', 'expressions', 'scene.Also', 'subject', 'afterlife', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Kathy', 'field', 'seeing', 'Tommy', 'running', 'clearly', 'reference', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'two', 'lovers', 'reuniting', 'afterlife', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'type', 'happy', 'ending', 'so', 'often', 'movies', 'almost', 'expect', 'see', 'come', 'running', 'horizon', 'tellingly', 'never', 'Kathy', 'never', 'even', 'fantasy', 'progress', 'point', 'where', 'actually', 'embrace', 'thought', 'something', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'too', 'painful', 'more', 'time', 'deferral', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'brief', 'time', 'had', 'together.So', 'end', 'think', 'movie', 'life', 'specifically', 'blink-of-an-eye', 'flash', 'time', 'get', 'earth', 'Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'truly', 'love', 'will', 'know', 'amount', 'years', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'enough', 'want', 'deferral', 'would', 'give', 'almost', 'anything', 'one', 'fact', 'people', 'fictional', 'society', 'effect', 'bargain', 'humanity', 'away', 'exchange', 'own', 'deferrals', 'allow', 'innocent', 'young', 'people', 'suffer', 'die', 'exchange', 'own', 'deferrals', 'end', 'deferral', 'not', 'completion', 'too', 'soon', 'can', 'do', 'appreciate', 'moment', 'respect', 'fellow', 'humans', 'never', 'let', 'other', 'go']",N/A
1404541,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004EQAVFU,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Kazuo Ishiguro's best selling novel NEVER LET ME GO has been transformed into a screenplay by Alex Garland that condenses the novel but allows the mystery of the writer's concept to come shining through.  Mark Romanek directs a perfect cast and manages to make the whole strange idea of the story seem hauntingly real.Through the mists of England develops the image of a tranquil appearing old school,  Hailsham,  a special school where the students are all selected, segregated from society to be taught and nurtured into becoming transplant donors.  The school is run by Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) who is strict but also benevolent.  The story focuses on three students - Tommy (Charlie Rowe), Kathy (Isobel Meikle-Small), and Ruth (Ella Purnell).  Kathy longs for Tommy's affections but Ruth is the bolder of the two girls and makes her feelings for Tommy known. The only person who brings a semblance of reason and solace to the students is Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins): she is dismissed as insubordinate for telling the truth to the students. The students age into young people - Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) have become a couple and have also begun their donations of organs while Kathy (Carey Mulligan) has taken the role of Carer and follows the lives of the two friends.  As Ruth approaches her third organ donation she expects to enter 'completion' and clears her guilt of having taken Tommy from Kathy by joining Kathy and Tommy in a romance that she hopes will lead to a state of delay (the school has always informed them that if two students are truly in love they will be spared their destiny for a while in order to live together).  Tommy is an artist and thinks that by proving his presence of a soul that he and Kathy will be granted this choice.  Hailsham has now closed and the two seek the art gallery curator for the school Madame (Nathalie Richard) to request permission, only to be met by both Miss Emily and Madame with the reality that the concept has been a false one all along.  The destiny of the students is served.The trio of actors - Mulligan, Garfield, Knightley - is superb, seducing us into believing in the story. The supporting roles as performed by Rampling, Richard, and Hawkins are equally strong.  This film, as the book, requires the audience to relinquish disbelief in the premise and instead bask in the beauty of the story, the acting, the lush cinematography by Adam Kimmel and the stunningly lovely musical score by Rachel Portman.

The director or writer spoke of the tendency for such individuals in any society to conform to their social conditioning, but the problem is that these types aren't interesting, only those that break free are, and in this film none do though the pair ask to do so and are told they cannot. The female lead should have been the one to do so, but all conformed till the end of their lives apparently. While that is nearly an exact portrait of most people in society, it is dull and not worthy of a film. Another problem is the male lead seems 'artistic' in his youth, but seems to have already had a lobotomy a few years later. It must have been the intent of the director to have that actor portray the character in that way, and his 'art' didn't seem 'special' to me at the end. The whole subtext of being 'ensouled' (Adamic) or not (PreAdamic) is mentioned in a way, but not investigated. In short, this is a film that could have been, but never was, and perhaps that was the same in the book. There was another such film on cloning done as a '70s tv movie that it reminds me of.

In this case, the film helped me better understand some of the central points of the book, points covered better elsewhere. With deftness worthy of the best art house auteurs, by remaining clear to its purpose, understated in its execution, subtle in its portrayal the profundity of Ishiguro's message arrives with disproportionately greater, devastatingly affecting force.

Whilst this is really no masterpiece, it is a most interesting, and above all else, disturbing experience to watch.  I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons here, but taken on its own, as I have, it will, or should, leave you with profound misgivings about what we have come to accept as unquestionable the benefits of transplant surgery.Although the film is presented in dystopian garb, it is all to easy to imagine such a nightmare coming true in the darker fringes of the world. Without wishing to reveal much of the plot, I feel bound to say that the idea of cloning apparently willing organ donors is not that far removed from the seduction of a nation's youth to go and die on the battlefield, as happened in the First World War. Here we have the idea of voluntary sacrifice taken to a grisly extreme.This is not a film for the faint-hearted nor anyone looking for a bit of entertainment. It is a dour, troubling and depressing experience, but none the less valuable for that. It is deliberately slow, but is a highly atmospheric film, in which you will find no tour de force of acting.

It is a serious, minority film with a serious message, which certainly ranks above average, yet perhaps because of its very nature falls short of 5 stars.

Basically the film events is centered on an issue that is ""realistic"" but has an ""un-realistic"" solution. The movie focuses on ""Organ donation"", which is something we have in our world today. I'm sure you've heard or knew of someone who either needs an Organ transplant in order to live or has donated an Organ for someone who needs it. However, in this movie [normal people] do not need to donate their organs for others to live, because there is a group of children especially created for that purpose and that purpose alone. They are made and created by scientists in order to donate their organs for the sake of others. Are these kids robots ? So you say. Well, no they are not. If they were machines or robots it wouldn't be possible for them to serve their purpose of organ donation duh ! Here we have [real] kids, who are basically modeled on existed people or what else we would call [cloning]. Of course, they have no past, no parents or family members but oddly enough those colons can feel just like we do and they can love too. The only difference is they have a limited life line, since after they reach their 30s and up to their third donation they usually suffer from complications and die.The film follows the lives of three of what I would like to call them [donation kids], from childhood till adulthood. Throughout the film they act human enough, there is all the human emotions you can imagine. Love, Hate, Jealousy, Drama, starving to get attention not wanting to be left behind etc....Well, I really don't know how I can categorize this film. I mean it is Sci-Fi without actually being Sci/Fi. Like you won't see any of your typical High-Tech equipments that we often see in Sci/Fi movies. There aren't any robots or aliens coming from other Galaxies either. Seriously there is hardly any indication that it's a Sci/Fi film. You won't be finding any action, laser guns, star wars fighting scenes or anything like that. Yes, there is a Conflict but it's not the war of the galaxies or the colons trying to take over the world kinda thing. So, Sci/Fi fans will probably be disappointed but Drama and Romance lovers I think will love this film more.I personally didn't find any problem watching it, because I love almost all film genders from a varying degree. Except Sci/Fi is my least favorite of all but I liked this movie and I think those who hate Sci/Fi will like it too.I liked the idea behind the story, I liked the concept. I didn't read the book. I don't know how accurate the movie is. However, I got the idea and I did enjoy it. It really got me thinking about is cloning people, is creating new lives in order to save others worth it ? Is making children for the purpose of stretching the human life span longer is the answer ? Well, I did feel a bit of My sister's Keeper there. Except this movie is totally different than My Sister's Keeper.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys those type of ""What if..."" movies. Like what I said Action fans will be disappointed.",4,What if....,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,3254,"['O.K', 'before', 'start', 'reviewing', 'film', 'just', 'wan', 'clear', 'one', 'thing', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'watching', 'considering', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'about.The', 'story', 'more', 'What', 'there', 'Basically', 'film', 'events', 'centered', 'issue', 'realistic', 'un-realistic', 'solution', 'movie', 'Organ', 'donation', 'something', 'have', 'world', 'today', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'knew', 'someone', 'who', 'Organ', 'transplant', 'order', 'live', 'donated', 'Organ', 'someone', 'who', 'However', 'movie', 'normal', 'people', ']', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'donate', 'organs', 'others', 'live', 'group', 'children', 'especially', 'created', 'purpose', 'purpose', 'alone', 'are', 'made', 'created', 'scientists', 'order', 'donate', 'organs', 'sake', 'others', 'Are', 'kids', 'robots', 'say', 'Well', 'are', 'not', 'were', 'machines', 'robots', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'possible', 'serve', 'purpose', 'organ', 'donation', 'duh', 'Here', 'have', '[', 'real', ']', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'basically', 'modeled', 'existed', 'people', 'what', 'would', 'call', '[', 'cloning', ']', 'course', 'have', 'past', 'parents', 'family', 'members', 'oddly', 'enough', 'colons', 'can', 'feel', 'just', 'do', 'can', 'love', 'too', 'only', 'difference', 'have', 'limited', 'life', 'line', 'reach', '30s', 'up', 'third', 'donation', 'usually', 'suffer', 'complications', 'die.The', 'film', 'lives', 'three', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'call', '[', 'donation', 'kids', ']', 'childhood', 'till', 'adulthood', 'film', 'act', 'human', 'enough', 'human', 'emotions', 'can', 'imagine', 'Love', 'Hate', 'Jealousy', 'Drama', 'starving', 'get', 'attention', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'left', 'etc', '.Well', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'can', 'categorize', 'film', 'mean', 'Sci-Fi', 'actually', 'being', 'Sci/Fi', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'typical', 'High-Tech', 'equipments', 'often', 'see', 'Sci/Fi', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'robots', 'aliens', 'coming', 'other', 'Galaxies', 'Seriously', 'hardly', 'indication', 'Sci/Fi', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'finding', 'action', 'laser', 'guns', 'star', 'wars', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'anything', 'Yes', 'Conflict', 'not', 'war', 'galaxies', 'colons', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'kinda', 'thing', 'So', 'Sci/Fi', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'lovers', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'more.I', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'problem', 'watching', 'love', 'almost', 'film', 'genders', 'varying', 'degree', 'Sci/Fi', 'least', 'favorite', 'liked', 'movie', 'think', 'who', 'hate', 'Sci/Fi', 'will', 'like', 'too.I', 'liked', 'idea', 'story', 'liked', 'concept', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'movie', 'However', 'got', 'idea', 'did', 'enjoy', 'really', 'got', 'thinking', 'about', 'cloning', 'people', 'creating', 'new', 'lives', 'order', 'save', 'others', 'making', 'children', 'purpose', 'stretching', 'human', 'life', 'span', 'longer', 'answer', 'Well', 'did', 'feel', 'bit', 'My', 'sister', 'Keeper', 'there', 'movie', 'totally', 'different', 'Sister', 'Keeper.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'type', 'What', 'movies', 'what', 'said', 'Action', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

It angered me profoundly, and set me to wondering why the poor clones didn't rise up and destroy their heartless oppressors. I then got to wondering how an educated people could approve of a program that raised people as ""organ-cattle"". And finally, imagining myself a clone in such a society, I decided it would be preferable to destroy oneself than to passively accept a role as an involuntary walking organ bank. In any event, the clones were going to die at the hands of the ghoulish doctors and nurses who were taking the clones vital organs for the benefit of unknown recipients.My heart went out to the clones. Who or what in hell gave such a society the power of life and death over these poor helpless creatures? And what Godless philosophy was it that decided that clones didn't have souls?

Is that upsetting enough for you? This is a horror film with very little blood and is a poignantly romantic film with very little sex.We see the gentle methods used to raise and educate these passive children, consequently we are not surprised to see that they are childlike even as adults. Why have them feel agitated when eventually they comprehend the reality of their horrific situation?There is a telling episode where two chums take our three main characters into a ""normal"" village. They don't know how to cross a street or order a meal. They cluster together like a gaggle of geese. It would be funny if it weren't so sad.This stellar cast is anchored by:*  Carey Mulligan (""An Education""), who is the odd girl out in what becomes a romantic triangle;*  Keira Knightley (""The Duchess"") gets the boy;*  Andrew Garfield (""The Social Network""), is wrenchingly effective as the man-boy who is the object of their affections.Even though this is beautifully shot and well acted, I had a devil of a time hearing their murmured dialogue.

1404552,A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,B004EQAVFU,"Jill Clardy ""So many books, so little time....""","[0, 0]","The movie opens in 1978 at Halisham, in what appears to be a old English boarding school, run by the stern headmistress Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling). It is soon made clear that Hailsham is not a typical boarding school. The health of the students is emphasized over all other considerations, and the students lead a very sheltered existence in which they have no outside visitors, no parents, and never leave the grounds. They have been fed a series of tales about life on the outside and the dangers of stepping outside the fence line.The 3 primary characters, acted so skillfully by Andrew Garfield, Keira Knightley, and Carey Mulligan, are in their prepubescent years, and begin to be interested in each other and more curious about the outside world. A disenchanted teacher &#34;spills the beans&#34; that that their purpose is to grow up so that their vital organs can be harvested; their truncated lives will be &#34;complete&#34; after 3 or 4 donations. Oddly, the students seem to accept their fate, and try to live their short lives as fully as they can. When Halisham closes, they are moved out to nearby cottages to finish out their time before they are old enough to start their donations. Their yearn to know more about their &#34;originals&#34;, i.e. their parents. The 3 become enmeshed in a love triangle, and the friendship starts to splinter. Eventually they go their separate ways, to begin their donations; and in Carey's case, to become a &#34;carer&#34; for other donors.The premise of the film is rather horrifying - that humans are &#34;farmed&#34; for the specific purpose of giving up their lives so that others can live. There seems to be little or no resistance to such a system, as society has been convinced somehow that these donors are less than human.The film is difficult to categorize - is it a romance? is it science fiction? It deals with a futuristic topic, but is set in the past. You can't help but feel empathy for the 3 young people, and the fate that they face so stoically. Will they escape the fate of so many others?

This film is an exercise in understatement; rarely have I seen a film that's so emotional and yet avoids bravado and manages to depict these emotions in such a gentle way. This is no straight-forward drama and there's an unconventional element to the story that I feel would be best to keep secret from the potential viewer. Unfortunately, it's difficult to discuss/critique the film without disclosing that element. With that said, the secret comes out very early into the movie so don't feel that I'm spoiling anything for you.Besides a brief opening scene, the film opens in 1978 at a boarding school called Hailsham. While headmistress Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) gives her daily announcement to the students, it becomes clear that Hailsham is not the typical boarding school. The health of the students is greatly important and the students' existence is a sheltered one, completely cut off from the world outside the boundaries of the school. Students are at the age where romantic ideals begin to blossom and young Kathy H. takes a liking to a boy named Tommy. Those wondering what the purpose of Hailsham is don't have to wait very long as a disenchanted guardian named Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins) soon enlightens them that their purpose is to grow up and donate their vital organs before their ""short-life"" will be completed. As this chapter of the film comes to a close, Kathy watches her friend Ruth and Tommy grow close. These childhood scenes are handled with great sentiment, but also with great austerity.The next two segments take place in 1985 and then 1994, where Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield take on the roles of Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy. This second part takes place at The Cottages, where the three Hailsham students have their first contact with the outside world and their sexual awareness comes to full fruition. It's here that we learn a bit more about the students' purpose, as well as watch some characters struggle with their already pre-determined fate. ""Completion,"" the third part of the film is arguably the most tragic where hope and optimism leads to sad acceptance.Despite being only 103 minutes, Never Let Me Go manages to tell a pretty full story and show characters completely evolve from nave children to nave, but optimistic adults. Watching these characters evolve is heartbreaking and the way the film burrows into your emotional center with such quiet nuance is astounding. Rarely do elements fall together so perfectly in a film that they completely immerse you in what you're watching and in it's own a soft, sad way this film absolutely casts a spell. This is not a film that will appeal to a wide audience, but I personally found it to be quite masterful.The film's score by Rachel Portman is one of the most effective musical scores I've heard in 2010. The music evokes such sadness it becomes a key element to the success of the film as a whole. The picturesque photography by cinematographer Adam Kimmel is poetic and beautiful, static yet graceful and adds an additional level of poignancy that the screenwriter could not have foreseen.As for acting, we get to watch three very promising young actors do some wonderful work. The most surprising is Keira Knightley who gives such an honest portrayal I forgot I was watching Knightley. Ditching any glamor or sharp-tongued wit, she plays the insecure, jealous, and frightened Ruth marvelously. Garfield continues to establish himself as one of the strongest up-and-coming actors at work today. He gets such pathos out of his mix of sadness and optimism; Watch Garfield's face as he learns the truth about deferrals and the way his expression quietly goes from hopefulness to helplessness. Contrast this with his acclaimed performance in The Social Network and you have an actor building an impressive body of work. Meanwhile, Carey Mulligan continues to prove that she is something special and refreshing in the film industry. What an elegant, immensely talented actress she is and her work here is brilliant. Mulligan is a true actress, something Hollywood is lacking these days and her performance here is so powerful, yet completely low-key.There is something so brave and unexpected about taking a premise rooted in science-fiction and, in doing so, making a deeply moving human drama and a profound, meditative statement on life, death, and humanity. Again, I've never read the book but I wonder if the book is as much of an emotional journey as the film. I would never call this film ""uplifting,"" but the tragic, beautiful ending is one of the most life-affirming endings of 2010.Never Let Me Go had much more of an impact the second time I watched it. It seemed more heartbreaking, more poignant, more powerful, and more beautiful than it did the first time. It's a deeply emotional viewing experience that gripped my emotions in a way few films have. While highly praised by some critics, it's been largely overshadowed by other films of 2010.  Never Let Me Go is as elegant, thought-provoking, and moving as films can get. It's undoubtedly one of the best films of 2010.GRADE: A",5,Even More Moving the Second Time,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,5367,"['breakthrough', 'medical', 'science', 'came', '1952Doctors', 'could',

1404555,A11L3YX5WIDKJ,B004EQAVFU,Kelli of I'd So Rather Be Reading,"[1, 2]","I saw the trailer for Never Let Me Go and it reminded me of one of my favorite books: Neal Shusterman's Unwind.  The concepts of &#34;donations&#34; and &#34;completion&#34; were similar to the &#34;unwinding&#34; in Unwind, and since I loved that concept in Unwind, I decided to watch Never Let Me Go.I know that Never Let Me Go is based on a book of the same name; however, I have not read the book.  I almost always prefer to read the book before seeing the movie, but in this case, due to lack of reading time, I made an exception.My first problem with Never Let Me Go was that I had a really hard time understanding the dialogue.  All of the characters have British accents (something I usually enjoy), but they spoke very quickly and were all &#34;low talkers.&#34;  I couldn't turn the volume up high enough to hear everything properly without blasting my husband and baby out of the house, so, about 15 minutes in, I ended up turning on the subtitles.So, subtitles on, I settled in to watch the rest of the movie.  I will admit that I knew the premise of the story because I read the plot on IMDB.  I know, I know, I broke all of my rules with this movie!  I don't think I would have known what was going on had I not read the plot, though, so I'm glad I did.Never Let Me Go is an emotional thriller.  There is not a lot of excitement, just sadness.  The characters are steeped in a pervasive desperation, enveloped in quiet despair.  One thing that bothered me was how skinny the characters are.  You'd think that a boarding school devoted to keeping its students in perfect health would have fed them more!The entire movie mad me so sad that when the credits started rolling I told my husband I would have been better off watching Parks and Recreation (which was my other available choice).  Never Let Me Go had the emotional impact of Unwind, but without the hopeful ending.  I would recommend it for people looking for a movie that makes you think.

The children were raised strictly but well cared for and raised to know they have a valuable purpose in life.  A distressed new teacher tells the children what that purpose is, but it seems they already know and accept it utterly.  A childhood love triangle between Kathy and her classmates Ruth and Tommy has a lasting effect on the three; years later as they fulfill their destinies, Kathy is moved to ponder if they are really so different from everyone else.I was completely shattered by this movie; it left me shocked and saddened and very, very frightened. It's about a world in which people have extended life spans thanks to the likes of Kathy and her friends who comply with their inescapable duty, much to our horror.  Mulligan, Knightly (Ruth), and Andrew Garfield (Tommy) are all wonderfully subtle and convincing. The script is clever and intriguing, and terrifying in its realism.This is an exceptional sci-fi story similar in tone to ""1984,"" and it's also a tender love story.

1404561,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B004EQAVFU,M. Bullions,"[4, 5]","I am admittedly unfamiliar with Kazuo Ishiguro's acclaimed best-selling novel, ""Never Let Me Go"", I was simply in a dull mood and state of mind, one summer afternoon, turned on the television, and there it was. And I can honestly say, having watched (mostly for reviewing purposes) the majority of gory horror films released in the past decade, or so. I never have, or maybe it's just been a very long time since I've seen a film as utterly screwed-up and disturbing as ""Never Let Me Go"".There is no physical violence in this film, as there are no dark and ominous scary orchestra crescendos, when a teenage character opens the door that they aren't supposed to. But its themes are horrifying, yet it's also deeply depressing, and moving. It finds a weird, but interesting middle-ground between drama, horror, and romance, with science fiction-y elements.""Never Let Me Go"" is set in an alternate reality where, in the 1970s, the common life expectancy passes 100, and human cloning is a reality. It's about a group of children, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy (Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield, respectively) who attend an English boarding school called Hailsham, which, is filled with seemingly normal boys and girls. Although, pretty early on, is clear that it's not a normal boarding school, and these are not normal boys and girls. It is revealed that these children are clones, conceived to eventually donate vital organs to ""real"" people. It is planned for them, that, beginning in their twenties, they are to give donations, one after the other, until, well, you know.The heart of it lies with the three lead characters. It follows Kathy, Ruth and Tommy from their childhoods, into their teenage years, where they discover what being a real person is like, and get their first taste of freedom. Carey Mulligan was nominated for an Oscar for her first real performance, in ""An Education"". She does a better job here, than there, pulling off the dreary, yet, somehow hopeful demeanor of Kathy, as Keira Knightley pulls off the flighty and lovelorn Ruth, but she can't hold a candle to Mulligan. I saw Andrew Garfield in ""The Social Network"", which was made after this film. He didn't really leave an impression on me in that movie. He adds to the atmosphere, in this one. The story wouldn't work without these characters. The three leads are pulled off so well, it made this viewer dread their obvious fates and (mis)fortunes.I came into this film knowing almost nothing about it. I knew it was based on a very popular novel, and that it was critically described to be quite strange. It piqued my interest in a way that a lot of things do. I hear that it's a pittance, compared to the apparently superior novel, which I'll eventually have to get around to. It paints such a bleak and sorrowful picture of the dystopian society where it takes place, which it was clearly going for, yet it has undeniably gorgeous landscapes and backdrops. Cinematically, it's done in kind of a Sofia Coppola-esque way. And plus It's acted well enough to make you feel for its characters, and it has a romantic aspect which you don't expect. It's multi-layered enough, to make a decent film, however it feels distant and cold, and tends to shy away from the heavy emotional narrative. I hear the book is one where the emotional impact creeps up on its reader, and even though the theme is grim, the film's wide scope and gorgeous backdrops give you a dreamlike vibe, and gives you the idea that a character is going to wake up and snap back into a better, more hopeful world. Aside from the last five or ten minutes, it decides to shy away from the heavy emotional issue at hand, which hurts it, in my opinion.

We are in a British Boarding house called Halisham House, however, the children are not like other children. They are not orphans as I at first expected. They are clones. Children created and raised to be healthy and eventually donate their organs to help others before they reach ""even middle age.""  The story focuses around Kathy, Ruth and Tommy.  Kathy likes Tommy but when Ruth and Tommy become an item.When they are old enough to leave Halisham House, they go to ""The Cottages"" until they are called to be donors. There is no need for life lessons as their only purpose is to donate.Ruth and Tommy are still together which leaves Kathy to become a carer, a kind of social worker. While at ""The Cottages"" they hear a rumor from other clones that Halisham kids can defer from donorship.The three eventually go their own ways until Kathy visits Ruth during one of her post-ops. They visit Tommy, and Ruth tells them that she had been jealous of their ""true love"" and took Tommy from Kathy. She believes they should be together and tells them she has had time to think about how she could make it right. She wants them to get a deferral and be together.They seek out a way for the deferral only to hear that there never was one.

What is that medical breakthrough?  Cloning.  People are cloned and those clones are mentally conditioned to accept their destiny as giving their body parts to let others live longer.  You'll last through about three or four surgeries typically before you expire, or, as they term it: completion.  Even though the clones do all the things humans (i.e. love, worry, cry, compose art, think of their futures) they are chillingly determined to have no souls and are in a sense slaves of the New World.  The focus isn't upon explaining how this world all came about nor some rebellion against the New Order but instead the fatalistic acceptance of the destiny of the clones.  Unsurprisingly, this tale ends tragically.  Some audiences will likely shrug this off as make believe but as I mentioned in my review of the novel things like this have happened or are happening in the world.  There's a Middle Eastern Prince who flies around the world on his private jet and pays people off for a kidney and then there was that relatively recent tale of someone doing the same thing in NYC (who got it from some poor person in South America).  People act like there would be an uproar but I'm not entirely sure of that belief.  What about all those cheap things we get at Walmart?  A lot of those are made overseas by people who pretty much suffer under slave labor and/or slave wages.  Anyway, the tale was a bit slow and idyllic for my tastes but it was thought provoking and that is something few movies do these days.

1404570,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B004EQAVFU,Muzzlehatch,"[72, 79]","First of all, I haven't read the 2005 novel by Kazuo Ishigiro that this film is based on, nor did I know much of anything about it apart from the basics (dystopian English alternate-world story) before seeing the film. So the few problems I mention or areas that I feel the film is deficient in dealing with are wholly a product of my experience with the movie - I suspect that some of these issues might be less problematic in the novel.  As you can see from my rating and review, I think the positives far outweigh the negatives.Second of all, if you know even less than I did, be prepared for **SPOILERS**All that out of the way, what we have here is a story taking place in a roughly contemporary (1978-94) England, a country (and presumably, world) radically changed by medical advances that did not happen in our world. Or...maybe. The most fascinating element of this film to me, and I'm sure the most infuriating to many viewers, is that we never get a really clear picture as to just what the technology is, how things have changed. The focus here is not on technology, on the science fictional aspects, on gadgetry or medicine. We get a few references to cloning, but never any details; we learn fairly quickly that the children we're introduced to at the Hailsham boarding school have a ""special"" destiny, and the film follows three of them in particular, one of whom, Kathy (Izzy Meikle-Small as a child/Carey Mulligan as an adult) narrates the film from 1994 at around the age of 30.Kathy, her companions Tommy (Charlie Rowe/Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Ella Purnell/Keira Knightley) are all being raised in a comfortable, serene - almost idyllic - countryside school to face a very particular and peculiar destiny. We get several hints early on - but only get the full heartbreaking story from a sympathetic (and summarily dismissed) young teacher named Lucy (Sally Hawkins): the children are all clones who will be harvested for their organs before the age of 30, dying typically after their third or fourth ""donation"". Lucy delivers the news with compassion and sadness; the rest of society, including the leaders of the school and apparently virtually all donors, have simply accepted this new world order, for the sake of the longer lives (we're told in a brief script at the beginning of the film that the average lifespan has passed 100) and comfort it has given them. The donors are essentially regarded as cattle.  Eventually they move on from the school to ""The Cottages"" a few years later in the second third of the film, as the forward and vivacious Ruth has taken up with the awkward and introverted Tommy, which Kathy considered becoming a ""Carer"", helping to take care of the donors before she herself becomes one.  In the last third of the film, 1994, all three confront their inevitable destinies.In most such visions, the story would be about attempts to escape the repressive regime, or overthrow it. The genius and heartbreak of NEVER LET ME GO is that it shows a society - or a very tiny portion of one - that is completely conditioned to the way things are now; nobody even dreams of running away or changing things, and the idea of there being an ethical dilemma is never actually broached by any character until quite near the end of the film. This was, I'll admit, something of a problem for me as I was watching the film - it's really quite hard to take the blind acceptance of such an awful fate on the part of everyone; but I think that Ishiguro and the filmmakers here are making a statement that only seems unrealistic if we forget the history of the last century. I do have a slight problem with the notion that things could have happened so very quickly in a democracy like England, but if we look at something like Orwell's ""1984"" - set 35 years after its publication - as a model, we shouldn't be surprised. The English dystopian vision has always seemed a particularly mordant and immediate one. And setting the film in essentially our time also allows it to be made much more cheaply - it's ""science fiction"" certainly, but it doesn't require the kinds of sets and effects that we usually think of the genre as having nowadays.I think that another factor that is going to be problematic for many is that we just see a very small fraction of this society, which must be so very different in many aspects but which looks essentially the same to we viewers. We are kept in the presence of our three main characters throughout, and we never see the recipients of any of these peoples' ""gifts""; we never encounter the government; we never hear anyone from outside of their little world express an opinion. For me this helped keep the exquisite sadness and intensity of the growing sense of loss that these young people had fresh and vivid throughout, and without encumbering the actual film with external voices, we are allowed to consider all the ethical ramifications and meanings of this changed world entirely on our own. The donors could be read as metaphors for slavery; for how we treat animals; for abortion; for the place of women in a man's world; in short, for any way in which the rulers and the majority of a society have treated and continue to treat those without any power. There are several moments where the word ""soul"" is used - though the film has no visible religious agenda, the notion is that the idea of living organ donation is perhaps accepted because the clones are viewed as not having souls, as not being fully human - an argument that was made not so long ago about other kinds of people in the world we live in.The acting and nearly everything about the production is pretty impressive; director Romanek has just made two previous features, ONE HOUR PHOTO and STATIC, over the past 15 years.  I haven't seen either of those, but he has a sure hand here, putting together Alex Garland's screenplay and the performances of the fine ensemble with a minimum of sentimentality or lingering, overt emotion - which if anything serves to increase the power of the storytelling and the ultimate tragedy of the piece. Rachel Portman's music is very low-key, repetetive, insistent; at first it irritated me a bit, but gradually it grew on me, mirroring the ultimately dead-end, resigned lives of the protaganists. Of the cast I have to single out Carey Mulligan, who seems likely to get some of the same kind of awards talk she did a year ago when she burst on the scene in An Education. She has to communicate a calmness, empathy, resignation and yet a flicker of never-ending internal determination and purpose throughout the film, and I don't know that many actresses could have managed.As Orson Welles once said aboutMake Way for Tomorrow, another heartbreaker about the inevitability of fate, it would make a stone cry.

I had read the novel when it first came out and found myself haunted by the doomed characters and their tragic story. I couldn't wait to see the film, but since it never played in my city, I had to wait for the DVD to be released.I believe this film brings the novel to life and that those who loved the book will be taken with the movie even though it is not a literal rendering. In some ways, the film is superior. Two brief scenes that showed young donors with missing limbs and eyes underlined the horror of their sacrifice in a way the book glossed over.The film captures the look and spirit of the novel brilliantly. The actors are magnificent. The wardrobe and settings are all dead on. I don't see how anything about the film could have been improved.I very much enjoyed the extras included with the disc. The interviews with cast and crew were fascinating -- for them the project was clearly a labor of love. And the short feature on the the fictional National Donor Programme with its medical forms and promotional brochures sent shivers down my spine.

1404573,A1PTBXZG04GT29,B004EQAVFU,NewAgeMama,"[0, 0]","If you love movies that can move you to tears, than you have to see ""Never Let Me Go"". This is the type of film that will touch you on many different levels. It brings together an all star cast including Cary Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, and Keira Knightly, who all give glowing performances. The story follows the lives of three friends, starting with their time in a mysterious boarding school. Shortly into the movie, you learn that they are genetically engineered clones whose sole purpose in life if to be organ donors. While they are always friends, an inevitable love triangle develops.  Kathy and Tommy are the two that really belong together, but the more aggressive Ruth has a way of getting in the middle of them. Throughout the movie, they struggle to find a way be together. If they are able to find true love, they believe they might be granted a few extra years of life before they have to become donors.While the love story in this movie is endearing and emotional, that is not the aspect of the movie that really held my attention. In a world where genetic cloning is a real possible, the thought of creating people, just to steal their organs, is a disturbing thought. The characters in the film do sometimes wonder about their ""original"" whom they were cloned from, but they never even question or fight their destiny of giving their lives for others. At best, they only hope for a few extra years. They know the whole time that they will never live to be middle aged, and they accept it with amazing grace.There are a few people in the movie who do what they can to try to prove the clones are people too, that they have souls, but they are constantly thwarted by those who are not willing to give up their miracle cures. It makes me wonder how our world would really react to this situation. Its easy for me to say I would never take another person's life, clone or not, when me and my children are healthy. But if one of my children needed a new heart or liver and a nameless, faceless clone could give it to them, would I have the strength to turn it down? Would you? Even if you knew they could love and fear death just as much as we do?  If we could overlook their very human feelings to suite ourselves while they face death with courage and grace, maybe we are the ones that have no soul.As you can see, this is the kind of movie that invokes deep thought and emotion. I would recommend it to anyone.

1404575,A14AD0NQTRVVJC,B004EQAVFU,Patrick J. Sullivan,"[11, 13]","Never Let Me Go is director Mark Romanek's screen adaptation ofKazuo Ishiguro's 2005 acclaimed novelof the same name. The film is buoyed up by a mostly superb cast, a haunting score by Rachel Portman, and an Alex Garland script that is largely faithful to the source novel. Despite widespread critical and audience disagreement over the true themes of the film, the generally positive reception is a testimony to its worth.""Haunting"" is the adjective most often used to describe the film, for good reason. Although the better-known Keira Knightley received top billing during the film's limited and unsuccessful 2010 theater run, it is Carey Mulligan as Kathy H. who owns the bulk of the screen time, and she delivers a sterling performance. If there is a weak link at all in the cast, it is probably Knightley, playing Ruth. Andrew Garfield as Tommy completes the triangle, and his strong turn ably complements Mulligan's.The rather thin plot of the film has been described in detail elsewhere. Remarkably, almost no two people, even among the cast and crew, seem to fully agree on what the film is actually about. Love, mortality, humanity, and many other explanations have all been offered. I wouldn't presume to say anyone else's interpretation of the work's theme is wrong, but additional insight into what the creators were trying to say may be gained by viewing the film as an allegory rather than a straightforward (and thus largely pointless) cautionary tale about cloning people and stealing their organs.Although allegory is a form of storytelling that has long been out of literary high fashion, there is still, in dystopian fiction in particular, a strong tradition of using allegory.Nineteen Eighty-Fourwas really about 1948. In its dayBrave New Worldwas about a lot more than just sex. So it is incorrect to see Romanek, Garland, and Ishiguro as just stalely following in Larry Niven's footsteps 40 years after that science fiction author penned stories about kidnapping victims for their organs. Never Let Me Go isn't about clones or organ transplantations. Not specifically or solely, at any rate. It is about any group of persons, those society sees as non-persons, who are bereft of a voice to rail against the use others would make of them.The film's clones represent any class of individuals who are dehumanized. Those forced into sexual slavery. Political prisoners in totalitarian countries (some of whose organs are harvested against their will; this much at least is not science fiction). Jews and Gypsies in concentration camps. The mentally handicapped. Children - including unborn ones. The aged and enfeebled. Slaves, historically and today.Because the film's young, able-bodied protagonists would be capable of fighting back or attempting to flee, many observers have expressed frustration at the lack of any organized resistance to the organ-harvesting scheme. But once you see Kathy and her fellow clones an analogues of political prisoners, sex slaves, concentration camp detainees, warehoused nursing home patients, and so on, then that objection disappears. Kathy could fight or flee, but the type of powerless, impersonalized victim whom the character really represents usually cannot.Though the allegory may seem heavy-handed once it is recognized as allegory at all, the film's creators have deliberately not simply drawn a parallel between their clones and any one group of those who have been unpersoned throughout history. Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth stand for anyone whose humanity, though obvious to us, has been denied by society at large.That is the backdrop against which the film's performances take place. Because Never Let Me Go is about the dehumanization of the individual by society and the state - even though a whole class of such individuals may be in question - the focus is almost exclusively on Kathy and her two friends, plus a very small number of other people. There will be no massed battle here; it is not about setting one grandiose vision against another. It is about rejecting the interpretation of humanity as a collection of movements rather than as a (large) set of distinct individuals.On this level, the film works superbly. Though intelligent, Kathy and the other clones cling desperately to what is obvious to the audience is the falsest of false hopes - because they have no other hope. Within the film, its title refers to a song of that name which becomes very important to Kathy in her adolescence. The characters experience nostalgia for a youth they never really had, even when young. They desperately try to cram experiences into their limited days. And they cling - and beg to be clung to, as in the song - to hope, love, and life.It is a shame that distributors didn't trust American tastes more to have allowed this film a larger release. Hopefully, Never Let Me Go will enjoy a long life through DVD and other media, as its message is not that of an alternate 1970s in which cloning and organ harvesting are common, but a timeless

This poignant film has one terrible premise:  in an alternate near future, most citizens in Britain live very long lives because the nation raises children whose sole purpose in life is to act as organ donors for the rest of society.  These donors are raised in a boarding school environment and at first are not told of their ghastly fates; they are only told that they need to stay ""healthy.""  Eventually they learn that their common fate is to make, on average, four organ ""donations"" when in their early twenties, the fourth of which, on average, will be fatal. This is their fate from birth and it is inflexible. The entire weight of society is behind this grisly arrangement, and more than anything else, what bothered me about this film was the way it showed the young donors' acceptance of society's dictate regarding their fates.

1404582,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B004EQAVFU,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","Modern science fiction films tend to be big, brassy, noisy affairs, filled with bug-eyed aliens, intergalactic battle scenes, and sense-assaulting special effects. But ""Never Let Me Go,"" based on a 2005 novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, is here to remind us of just how profound and thought-provoking the genre can be when played in a minor key.Like ""Brave New World,"" ""1984,"" ""Fahrenheit 451,"" and countless others before it, ""Never Let Me Go"" offers a dystopic vision of a ""futuristic"" world that has profound implications for our present day. However, Ishiguro, rather than setting his story in the future, chose to place it in an alternate-universe version of the late 20th Century, when the life expectancy is now over a hundred, thanks, in no small measure, to the fact that society has found the means to ""cultivate"" clones for the sole purpose of harvesting their organs once they hit their early 20s. That means that none of these folk will live to see their 30th birthday.This haunting and heartbreaking tale centers on Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, three youngsters growing up in what first appears to be just another typical boarding school nestled in the British countryside. But soon sinister implications begin to emerge as we, along with the children, discover the truth about them and the purpose they will serve in life. The movie then jumps ahead to various points in the future as the three of them begin to fulfill their pre-ordained duty as ""donors.""On the surface, the film is an obvious indictment of the evils of eugenics, portraying a society so in dread of its own mortality that it is willing to forsake any semblance of personal morality or ethics to ensure its own longevity and health. The aging headmistress (played by the always wonderful Charlotte Rampling) even makes the case that, no matter how sympathetic the general populace might be towards the plight of these ""donors,"" people would never opt to return to a world filled with cancer and other deadly diseases. There's a wonderful scene in which guilt-ridden delivery men avert their eyes from the very children they know will one die day that they might live. But beyond the eugenics aspects, the film also functions as an allegorical illustration of the extent to which the privileged classes in general will go in exploiting the masses to get what they need in order to sustain their own extravagant lifestyles.Yet, it is as a human drama that ""Never Let Me Go' makes the deepest mark on our hearts. Through a trio of off-the-chart performances, Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley make us care deeply about these three people who seem strangely passive about their fates, yet who still strike out as best they can for a meaningful existence within the strict parameters assigned to them. Despite this dark cloud hanging over their heads, they still find time to fall in love, have sex, become jealous, enjoy their time together, and form lasting bonds of friendship. As Kathy notes near the end, everyone will eventually ""complete"" at some point or another (gotta' love those euphemisms we humans use to help salve our consciences when we know we're doing something wrong); these ""donors"" just happen to be doing so at an earlier stage than most.Alex Garland's screenplay is thoughtful, lyrical and restrained, and Mark Romaneck follows suit in his direction. As to the performances, there is one particular scene - in which Kathy and Tommy slowly realize that the slim hope they had for a postponement of their fate has been a cruel delusion - that should be shown to every student of acting who is serious about the profession. The complexity of thought and depth of emotion that Mulligan and Garfield are able to convey through sheer facial expressions alone is truly a wonder to behold. But then again, all who were involved in the making of this film can be immensely proud of their work here.I would also like to congratulate the original author for not doing what most writers of dystopic literature seemingly feel compelled to do, which is to turn it into another one of those damn chase stories where the characters spend most of their time trying to outrun the sinister forces out to get them (my biggest beef, in fact, with the good but overrated ""Children of Men,"" for instance). For that alone, I am profoundly grateful.Filled with unforgettable performances, ""Never Let Me Go"" is, without a doubt, one of the finest films of recent times.",5,A masterpiece,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,4447,"['Modern', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'big', 'brassy', 'noisy', 'affairs', 'filled', 'bug-eyed', 'aliens', 'intergalactic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'sense-assaulting', 'special', 'effects', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'based', '2005', 'novel', 'Kazuo', 'Ishiguro', 'here', 'remind', 'just', 'how', 'profound', 'thought-provoking', 'genre', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'played', 'minor', 'key.Like', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', '1984', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'countless', 'others', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'dystopic', 'vision', 'futuristic', 'world', 'profound', 'implications', 'present', 'day', 'However', 'Ishiguro', 'rather', 'setting', 'story', 'future', 'chose', 'place', 'alternate-universe', 'version', 'late', '20th', 'Century', 'when', 'life', 'expectancy', 'now', 'hundred', 'thanks', 'small', 'measure', 'fact', 'society', 'found', 'means', 'cultivate', 'clones', 'sole', 'purpose', 'harvesting', 'organs', 'hit', 'early', '20s', 'none', 'folk', 'will', 'live', 'see', '30th', 'birthday.This', 'haunting', 'heartbreaking', 'tale', 'centers', 'Kathy', 'Ruth', 'Tommy', 'three', 'youngsters', 'growing', 'up', 'what', 'first', 'be', 'just', 'typical', 'boarding', 'school', 'nestled', 'British', 'countryside', 'soon', 'sinister', 'implications', 'begin', 'emerge', 'children', 'truth', 'purpose', 'will', 'serve', 'life', 'movie', 'then', 'ahead', 'various', 'points', 'future', 'three', 'begin', 'fulfill', 'pre-ordained', 'duty', 'donors', 'surface', 'film', 'obvious', 'indictment', 'evils', 'eugenics', 'portraying', 'society', 'so', 'dread', 'own', 'mortality', 'willing', 'forsake', 'semblance', 'personal', 'morality', 'ethics', 'ensure', 'own', 'longevity', 'health', 'aging', 'headmistress', 'played', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'even', 'case', 'matter', 'how', 'sympathetic', 'general', 'populace', 'might', 'be', 'plight', 'donors', 'people', 'would', 'never', 'opt', 'return', 'world', 'filled', 'cancer', 'other', 'deadly', 'diseases', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'guilt-ridden', 'delivery', 'men', 'avert', 'eyes', 'very', 'children', 'know', 'will', 'one', 'die', 'day', 'might', 'live', 'eugenics', 'aspects', 'film', 'also', 'allegorical', 'illustration', 'extent', 'privileged', 'classes', 'general', 'will', 'go', 'exploiting', 'masses', 'get', 'what', 'need', 'order', 'sustain', 'own', 'extravagant', 'lifestyles.Yet', 'human', 'drama', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'deepest', 'mark', 'hearts', 'trio', 'off-the-chart', 'performances', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'make', 'care', 'deeply', 'three', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'strangely', 'passive', 'fates', 'who', 'still', 'out', 'best', 'can', 'meaningful', 'existence', 'strict', 'parameters', 'assigned', 'dark', 'cloud', 'hanging', 'over', 'heads', 'still', 'find', 'time', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'sex', 'become', 'jealous', 'enjoy', 'time', 'together', 'form', 'lasting', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'Kathy', 'notes', 'end', 'everyone', 'will', 'eventually', 'complete', 'point', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'humans', 'use', 'help', 'salve', 'consciences', 'when', 'know', ""'re"", 'doing', 'something', 'wrong', 'donors', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'doing', 'so', 'earlier', 'stage', 'most.Alex', 'Garland', 'screenplay', 'thoughtful', 'lyrical', 'restrained', 'Mark', 'Romaneck', 'suit', 'direction', 'performances', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'Kathy', 'Tommy', 'slowly', 'realize', 'slim', 'hope', 'had', 'postponement', 'fate', 'been', 'cruel', 'delusion', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'student', 'acting', 'who', 'serious', 'profession', 'complexity', 'thought', 'depth', 'emotion', 'Mulligan', 'Garfield', 'are', 'able', 'convey', 'sheer', 'facial', 'expressions', 'alone', 'truly', 'wonder', 'behold', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'immensely', 'proud', 'work', 'here.I', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'congratulate', 'original', 'author', 'not', 'doing', 'what', 'most', 'writers', 'dystopic', 'literature', 'seemingly', 'feel', 'compelled', 'do', 'turn', 'one', 'damn', 'chase', 'stories', 'where', 'characters', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'outrun', 'sinister', 'out', 'get', 'biggest', 'beef', 'fact', 'good', 'overrated', 'Children', 'Men', 'instance', 'alone', 'am', 'profoundly', 'grateful.Filled', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'doubt', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'recent', 'times']",N/A

It's about a special boarding school somewhere in England that is part of the National Donor Program, a program that has a chain of ""schools"" that are actually raising clones for future organ donation.Although the film claims in this alternate world we can live to be 100, I'm assuming that is because of the miracles of medicine regarding organ donation .  But why not just raise clones as sheep and harvest their organs for those who are dying or desperate.The clone eventually ""completes"" after a few major organs are removed, either dying outright with a team of nameless and emotionless doctors gathering around, or as a vegetable at some home.The story itself revolves around Tommy, Kathy and Ruth, three kids who bond early in their childhood.  Early in the film, a sympathetic teacher reveals their real purpose as short-lived solutions to adults who live on.  She is soon ""let go"" as it were.The performances are solid as well as the acting.  The cinematography is well done in creating a dark, sullen and depressing mood.At the same time, the film beats you severely about the head regarding the morality of clones and that they too can love, can fear, and can feel rage.The film confronts issues of ethics regarding organ donation, the creation of a supply for that purpose and whether this could possibly happen in a later, dystopian future.  Who is to say?There have been other organ harvesting films such as Coma (1978) and the more recent Repo Man (2010) but none so depressing and squeezing out your spirit as Never Let Me Go.  If anything, Never Let Me Go is a fascinating art film but that's about it.Keira Knightly is great as the jealous, vindictive Ruth, along with Carey Mulligan as Kathy (the leading lady) who is the most depressing of all and the target of their affections, Tommy, played with rage and fire by Andrew Garfield.Other Organ Harvest Films!ComaRepo Men (Unrated) [Blu-ray]The X-Files: I Want to Believe (Single-Disc Edition)",2,Haunting Yet Depressing Future!,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,2102,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'little', 'film', 'thought', ""'d"", 'check', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'depressing', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'special', 'boarding', 'school', 'somewhere', 'England', 'part', 'National', 'Donor', 'Program', 'program', 'chain', 'schools', 'are', 'actually', 'raising', 'clones', 'future', 'organ', 'film', 'claims', 'alternate', 'world', 'can', 'live', 'be', '100', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'miracles', 'medicine', 'regarding', 'organ', 'donation', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'raise', 'clones', 'sheep', 'harvest', 'organs', 'who', 'are', 'dying', 'desperate.The', 'clone', 'eventually', 'completes', 'few', 'major', 'organs', 'are', 'removed', 'either', 'dying', 'outright', 'team', 'nameless', 'emotionless', 'doctors', 'gathering', 'around', 'vegetable', 'home.The', 'story', 'around', 'Tommy', 'Kathy', 'Ruth', 'three', 'kids', 'who', 'bond', 'early', 'childhood', 'Early', 'film', 'sympathetic', 'teacher', 'reveals', 'real', 'purpose', 'short-lived', 'solutions', 'adults', 'who', 'live', 'soon', 'let', 'go', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'well', 'done', 'creating', 'dark', 'sullen', 'depressing', 'mood.At', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'severely', 'head', 'regarding', 'morality', 'clones', 'too', 'can', 'love', 'can', 'fear', 'can', 'feel', 'rage.The', 'film', 'confronts', 'issues', 'ethics', 'regarding', 'organ', 'donation', 'creation', 'supply', 'purpose', 'could', 'possibly', 'happen', 'later', 'dystopian', 'future', 'Who', 'say', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'organ', 'harvesting', 'films', 'such', 'Coma', '1978', 'more', 'recent', 'Repo', 'Man', '2010', 'none', 'so', 'depressing', 'squeezing', 'out', 'spirit', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'anything', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'fascinating', 'art', 'film', 'it.Keira', 'Knightly', 'great', 'jealous', 'vindictive', 'Ruth', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Kathy', 'leading', 'lady', 'who', 'most', 'depressing', 'target', 'affections', 'Tommy', 'played', 'rage', 'fire', 'Andrew', 'Garfield.Other', 'Organ', 'Harvest', 'Films', 'ComaRepo', 'Men', 'Unrated', '[', 'Blu-ray', 'X-Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'Single-Disc', 'Edition']",N/A

We fail to see that life is limitless, because we create arbitrary boundaries for ourselves, which stifle our true potential. We settle for the commonplace, and lie to ourselves by believing that this is all that there is. Most individuals will never break away from the traps that they have set up for themselves, and they will never know true freedom. However, some do find the will to escape, to be free, to grasp at a possible alternative. Some live their entire lives this way, and for others, it may only be a moment - but it is better to have had that one moment of true liberty, than to have lived your whole life without it.Never Let Me Go is about all of this and more. It is a film that you will never forget, and as you leave the theatre, you should have a renewed appreciation for the intricacies of life. It is a somber experience unlike anything that you have seen in quite some time, but it is that emotional punch that drives the film.In order to avoid spoilers, I will only provide a brief synopsis of the film. This film relies heavily on its secrets, in order to be effective. The film opens in an alternate, dystopian world at Hailsham, an English boarding school for young boys and girls. Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy have been best friends for quite sometime, and as a result, the quiet, reserved Kathy has developed an innocent crush on Tommy, a timid young man prone to random fits of rage. Meanwhile, headstrong Ruth sets out to garner the young man's affections. Young Kathy is heartbroken, but carries on. One day, while the children are in class, their schoolteacher suddenly breaks into tears. She pulls the blinders from their eyes, and reveals the harsh realities regarding their strict upbringing at Hailsham. It turns out that these children have been consigned to an unspeakable fate, which will alter their lives forever. After this revelation - which costs the teacher her job - we move forward in time, as Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy weave in and out of each others lives, as the threat of the inevitable hangs ceaselessly over their heads.This is a film that will grab you from start to finish. At one hour and forty-two minutes, this film runs the entire scope of human emotion. You care for these characters, and you feel as if you know them. You want to see them live; you want them to run, to escape, to own their lives. You want them to realize that there are no boundaries - that they were never there to begin with.If you feel as though I have not given you much of a synopsis, know that to say anything more would be detrimental to your experience of the film. This film was directed by Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo). He handles the material with such respect and delicacy, and as a result, he allows us to connect emotionally with what we see. Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightly, and Andrew Garfield truly live inside of these characters. Their strengths and weaknesses are up on the screen on full display for all to see. You will never forget these characters. You will never forget this film.

Yet despite the care lavished on them, their world has a puzzlingly second-hand feel. It is only when they are 11 years old that the boarding school children accidentally learn the sinister truth about who they are, why they are there, and what awful plans the state has in store for them.Three of the pupils form a love triangle,Kathy H (Mulligan), Tommy(Garfield),and Ruth (Knightley)Mulligan and Garfield are especially moving in their roles.A rage beneath the surface calm.They are in effect clones whose lives are about donating a supply of their organs at a date determined by somebody else's schedule.By age 18 they move onto the `cottages' in the country,they have a certain measure of freedom,they can drive about,but their lives are still circumscribed by wrist tags.This gentle, subtle film has sinister undertones.These clones are sympathetic,teeming with the hormones, anxieties,doubts of `normal'children,whose lives are shortened to early middle age.

1404594,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004EQAVFU,Turfseer,"[21, 60]","*** This review contains spoilers ***If there is one film you should avoid like the plague in 2011, it's 'Never Let Me Go'! Based on a pretentious novel by the Japanese novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, it's a story set in a dystopian England roughly between the 70s and the 90s.The story begins with three children, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy who attend Hailsham, a boarding school, run by an autocratic headmistress, Miss Emily, well-played by Charlotte Rampling. The children are brainwashed to accept the idea that when they grow to adulthood, they will become organ donors, in order to save terminally ill patients.When we finally flash forward to when the three children become adults, they continue to passively accept their fate as organ donors. In this film, we're asked to accept the idea of a world where there is no free will and adults walk around like zombie-like robots, simply waiting to accept their preordained fate.As the story unfolds, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy end up at a place called 'The Cottages'. There Kathy is turned off by the physical relationship between Ruth and Tommy. Ruth here is the antagonist, who taunts Kathy for her inability to accept her sexuality. Later, Ruth starts the organ donation process and begins to physically deteriorate. A rumor has been going around for a long time amongst the organ donor people that a couple can get a 'deferment' if they prove they're in love. Feeling guilty, Ruth gives Kathy and Tommy a contact address where they possibly can obtain a deferment since Ruth is no longer in the picture to drive a wedge between them. When they arrive at the house, they meet the old headmistress (now in a wheelchair). She tells them that the deferment was simply a myth and they can't get out of being organ donors.On a deserted road, Kathy stops the car she's been driving and lets Tommy out; he breaks down since he realizes he can never have a relationship with Kathy. Soon enough, Tommy's organs are harvested and we fade out as Kathy awaits her turn. Unbelievably, that's all there is to this ludicrous story! The only real significant conflict is between Kathy and Ruth over their affections for Tommy. They never attempt to revolt against the 'system' which would have made the film more exciting and interesting. Instead, the principals' ongoing passivity is a big bore and the love triangle is ordinary.While Carey Mulligan is certainly pleasing to look at it, her taste in scripts is highly questionable ('An Education' was only slightly better than 'Never Let Me Go'). The cinematography here was impressive and the soundtrack had a moody, haunting quality to it. But why do we hear the soundtrack almost continually throughout the entire movie? Could it be that the story is so inert that the director had to rely on the music underneath to suggest true emotions?'Never Let Me Go' is perhaps one of the most 'one note' films I've seen in recent memory.

1404595,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,B004EQAVFU,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[1, 2]","Spoilers:The big secret in the film is actually revealed very early on and though not overly shocking, it still leaves you feeling morose about the whole thing. The movie follows three friends all the way from school where they are told constantly that they are 'special', to adulthood where their lives coexist once more until they reach a certain point in their life. Throughout the film, all three characters know what their purpose is in life and what we, the audience never know is, why nothing is ever done about it. Theirs is a difficult fate, but they treat the knowledge with a kind of indifference that left me cold. Why do they never run away? Is it because they have so little knowledge of the outside world? No money? No connections? How did they get to the school, and where did they come from? All unanswered questions, but it doesn't completely detract from the film.Carey Mulligan just steals the spotlight in the subtle, yet endearing role of Kathy. Her heart was broken long ago by her two best friends, Tommy and Ruth, played by Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield. She hides it well and continues to live day by day knowing there isn't anything she can do about the situation. On top of what is already planned for the trio, she is clearly still reeling from her unrequited love, so she decides to take a job as a Carer, the role that is explained further in the film. Once she takes the position, she doesn't see her friends for ten years. Once they are reunited however, it is clear that many things have changed.I read someone's review that mentioned Never Let Me Go is just a bad remake of The Island. Well, how very wrong they are. The Island is just bad, the characters bland and robotic. Never Let Me Go is so much more than that. In this dystopian reality, the characters do not question their purpose, and they are not afraid. Though their lives may be limited, they still allow themselves to feel and to live and I think that is what makes the film so depressing because it really connects and resonates with viewers. This is not a film for everyone, it is slow-paced but never lacks for drama and emotion. I really wish it was more well-known because it truly is a little gem of a film.",4,Bleak and depressing,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,2218,"['Spoilers', 'big', 'secret', 'film', 'actually', 'revealed', 'very', 'early', 'not', 'overly', 'shocking', 'still', 'feeling', 'morose', 'whole', 'thing', 'movie', 'three', 'friends', 'way', 'school', 'where', 'are', 'told', 'constantly', 'are', ""'special"", 'adulthood', 'where', 'lives', 'coexist', 'once', 'more', 'reach', 'certain', 'point', 'life', 'film', 'three', 'characters', 'know', 'what', 'purpose', 'life', 'what', 'audience', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'nothing', 'ever', 'done', 'difficult', 'fate', 'treat', 'knowledge', 'kind', 'indifference', 'left', 'cold', 'Why', 'do', 'never', 'run', 'away', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'knowledge', 'outside', 'world', 'money', 'No', 'connections', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'school', 'where', 'did', 'come', 'unanswered', 'questions', ""n't"", 'completely', 'detract', 'film.Carey', 'Mulligan', 'just', 'spotlight', 'subtle', 'yet', 'endearing', 'role', 'Kathy', 'heart', 'was', 'broken', 'long', 'ago', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Tommy', 'Ruth', 'played', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'well', 'live', 'day', 'day', 'knowing', ""n't"", 'anything', 'can', 'do', 'situation', 'top', 'what', 'already', 'planned', 'trio', 'clearly', 'still', 'reeling', 'unrequited', 'love', 'take', 'job', 'Carer', 'role', 'explained', 'further', 'film', 'position', ""n't"", 'see', 'friends', 'ten', 'years', 'are', 'reunited', 'however', 'clear', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'changed.I', 'read', 'someone', 'review', 'mentioned', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'just', 'bad', 'remake', 'Island', 'Well', 'how', 'very', 'wrong', 'are', 'Island', 'just', 'bad', 'characters', 'bland', 'robotic', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'dystopian', 'reality', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'question', 'purpose', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'lives', 'may', 'be', 'limited', 'still', 'allow', 'feel', 'live', 'think', 'film', 'so', 'depressing', 'really', 'viewers', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'slow-paced', 'never', 'lacks', 'drama', 'emotion', 'really', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'well-known', 'truly', 'little', 'gem', 'film']",N/A
