The title would make you believe that she may have a some kind of power over corpses. I like the Japanese title instead. I sorry America you but miss the target on the marketing of this anime.But they do give fan service. If you love monsters they got, you want to see hot girls with guns they got despite she may be dead. Don't let us forgot the girls clothes always ripping in all they fights. Its a solid story nothing original but solid and likable characters. There are some surprise with the ending.

Shikibane are corpses that hang on to life after their deaths. They survive on regrets and taking human life. Shikibane Hime are corpses that try to earn their way into heaven by killing shikibane. Machina is one such corpse princess. Her partner is Keisei, a high ranking monk. This story is about Machina, her quest to find the monsters that killed her and her family, and the relationship she builds with Keisei and his brother. This series has a dark feel, but it keeps you interested and caring about the characters. The supporting characters are very well done as well. It takes a special man to score a chick that will fight for him. Where can I find one? Corpse Princess is a good series. Its not happy or anyhting like that, but it's worth seeing at least once. Ive watched a few times myself. Try out the first part just to get a feel for it.

The only thing that concerns me is that some of the motives of the protagonists and the antagonists are either unclear or not very good.

1361439,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B003SPDS6C,RavenRing,"[6, 12]","Makina Hoshimura is one of the undead known as a ""Shikabane Hime"", a Corpse Princess, who is capable of laying the restless undead to rest. Ouri is an innocent 15 year old high school student whose life if turned upside down when he learns that his ""big brother"" Keisei works with Makina laying the dead to rest. Keisei tries to keep Ouri out of danger, but Ouri's curiosity leads him deeper into the world of Shikabane.I've seen hundreds of different anime, and am getting very tired of the stereotypical characters and cookie cutter plots many anime rely on. The only reason I stuck through all of the Corpse Princess: Aka (a.k.a Shikabane-hime: Aka), was because I was watching it on Funimation's YouTube channel during my lunch breaks at work. Otherwise I would have given up after a few episodes.Corpse Princess isn't really a bad show - there are the noble undead fighting the evil undead and the innocent high school who gets caught up in the battle, the animation and character designs are well done, the voice acting good, and the music fitting. Unfortunately, it isn't enough. Decent animation, acting, and music, aren't enough to make up for the lack luster plot and boring characters. Makina is the cold, angry, kick-but character, Ouri is the bumbling, well meaning, kind character, and Keisei is the all-knowing, but never telling, character. See them once and you'll like them, see them a hundred times and it gets predictable and boring. The plot starts out focusing on just killing the rouge shikebane of the episode, but soon introduces the Seven Stars, a band of powerful shikebane with some nefarious purpose, who also happen to be the ones who killed Makina and her family. That pretty much covers the entire plot - defeat the bad guys. There isn't much else to it. Ouri does have a mysterious background that isn't completely revealed in this half, and if the videos had been posted, I probably would have watched the second half for that alone. But while waiting a few days for the first episode, I got bored and forgot about the show entirely.This is a solid middle of the line anime - if you are still new to anime, you might enjoy this show. If you have seen enough anime that you now demand a well done and interesting plot with developed characters, try something else.",3,Forgettable - Dead and Gone,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,2297,"['Makina', 'Hoshimura', 'one', 'undead', 'known', 'Shikabane', 'Hime', 'Corpse', 'Princess', 'who', 'capable', 'laying', 'restless', 'undead', 'rest', 'Ouri', 'innocent', '15', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'big', 'brother', 'Keisei', 'Makina', 'laying', 'dead', 'rest', 'Keisei', 'keep', 'Ouri', 'danger', 'Ouri', 'curiosity', 'deeper', 'world', 'Shikabane.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundreds', 'different', 'anime', 'am', 'getting', 'very', 'tired', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'plots', 'many', 'anime', 'rely', 'only', 'reason', 'stuck', 'Corpse', 'Princess', 'Aka', 'a.k.a', 'Shikabane-hime', 'Aka', 'was', 'was', 'watching', 'Funimation', 'YouTube', 'channel', 'lunch', 'breaks', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'few', 'episodes.Corpse', 'Princess', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'show', 'are', 'noble', 'undead', 'fighting', 'evil', 'undead', 'innocent', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'battle', 'animation', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'voice', 'acting', 'good', 'music', 'fitting', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Decent', 'animation', 'acting', 'music', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'luster', 'plot', 'boring', 'characters', 'Makina', 'cold', 'angry', 'kick-but', 'character', 'Ouri', 'bumbling', 'well', 'meaning', 'kind', 'character', 'Keisei', 'all-knowing', 'never', 'telling', 'character', 'See', 'once', ""'ll"", 'like', 'see', 'hundred', 'times', 'predictable', 'boring', 'plot', 'out', 'focusing', 'just', 'killing', 'rouge', 'shikebane', 'episode', 'soon', 'Seven', 'Stars', 'band', 'powerful', 'shikebane', 'nefarious', 'purpose', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'ones', 'who', 'killed', 'Makina', 'family', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'plot', 'defeat', 'bad', 'guys', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'Ouri', 'have', 'mysterious', 'background', ""n't"", 'completely', 'revealed', 'half', 'videos', 'had', 'been', 'posted', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'second', 'half', 'alone', 'waiting', 'few', 'days', 'first', 'episode', 'got', 'bored', 'forgot', 'show', 'entirely.This', 'solid', 'middle', 'line', 'anime', 'are', 'still', 'new', 'anime', 'might', 'enjoy', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'anime', 'now', 'demand', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'plot', 'developed', 'characters', 'try', 'something', 'else']",Corpse Princess: Part One - Aka
1361440,AFV2584U13XP3,B003SPDS6C,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]","The action,  drama,  and gore of the series is enough to entertain any r-rated anime fan out there,  and while there is fan service in the series the overall rating for any nudity won't go passed at most PG17 but again the series is bloody enough that it obviously isn't meant for young children to watch.  The short info of the series is that you have a shadow group called the seven stars who wish to reign chaos on the world so thus help with the creation and upheaval that is caused by supernatural creatures called Shikabane people who have died with some regret in their lives that becomes warped and brings them back from death to try and find closure with their regrets but their feelings to fix these feelings become warped and most times causes mayhem and death for people.  Now you have a group of holy mystical monks dedicated to stopping these creatures and the seven stars group and their choice of weapons are young teenage girls who have been killed by the Shikabane most times and through a long held mystical secret create contracts that binds these girls to their contracted monks with the promise that if they kill 108 Shikabane they will be rewarded with true death and entry into heaven.  The characters are very entertaining to watch and the action is great but you can't help but compare the series a little to another one called Claymore where certain parts of this series match up a little with the Claymore series.  The voice cast for the dubbed and subbed were picked very well and the animation is done very well too,  if there's one complaint for this series I would say the ending for it was to open ended I can't give away to much but if you want to you can see the series subbed on HULU and see what I'm talking about.  So for fans who like the hardcore femme fatale action hero here's a very good one right here but again the series reaches near R-rating with the gore so it's definitely not a family anime....",4,Entertaining Series But Like A Few Others Expect To Feel A Sense Of Deja Vu,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,1944,"['action', 'drama', 'gore', 'series', 'enough', 'entertain', 'r-rated', 'anime', 'fan', 'there', 'fan', 'service', 'series', 'overall', 'rating', 'nudity', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'passed', 'most', 'PG17', 'again', 'series', 'bloody', 'enough', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'meant', 'young', 'children', 'watch', 'short', 'info', 'series', 'have', 'shadow', 'group', 'called', 'seven', 'stars', 'who', 'wish', 'reign', 'chaos', 'world', 'so', 'thus', 'help', 'creation', 'upheaval', 'caused', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'called', 'Shikabane', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'regret', 'lives', 'warped', 'back', 'death', 'try', 'find', 'closure', 'regrets', 'feelings', 'fix', 'feelings', 'become', 'warped', 'most', 'times', 'mayhem', 'death', 'people', 'Now', 'have', 'group', 'holy', 'mystical', 'monks', 'dedicated', 'stopping', 'creatures', 'seven', 'stars', 'group', 'choice', 'weapons', 'are', 'young', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'Shikabane', 'most', 'times', 'long', 'held', 'mystical', 'secret', 'create', 'contracts', 'girls', 'contracted', 'monks', 'promise', 'kill', '108', 'Shikabane', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'true', 'death', 'entry', 'heaven', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'action', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'series', 'little', 'one', 'called', 'Claymore', 'where', 'certain', 'parts', 'series', 'up', 'little', 'Claymore', 'series', 'voice', 'cast', 'dubbed', 'subbed', 'were', 'picked', 'very', 'well', 'animation', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'one', 'complaint', 'series', 'would', 'say', 'ending', 'was', 'open', 'ended', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'much', 'want', 'can', 'see', 'series', 'subbed', 'HULU', 'see', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'So', 'fans', 'who', 'hardcore', 'femme', 'fatale', 'action', 'hero', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'right', 'here', 'again', 'series', 'R-rating', 'gore', 'definitely', 'not', 'family', 'anime']",Corpse Princess: Part One - Aka
