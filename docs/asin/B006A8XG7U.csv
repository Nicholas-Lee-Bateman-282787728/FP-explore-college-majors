1514115,A2U4KVPAK32T96,B006A8XG7U,James K. Stewart,"[1, 1]","I remember reading about the 1961 film ""Something Wild"" years ago, but only recently learned it was released on dvdin 2011 by MGM's limited-edtion collection division. I've had the fine Aaron Copland cd soundtrack for years that wasreleased on Varese Sarabande in 2003, but always wanted to see the film.  A stark, grim, and poignant examination ofa young girl's (Carroll Baker) experience with violence and despair in New York City, ""Something Wild"" is based on theAlex Karmel novella ""Mary Anne"" and was directed by Baker's then-husband Jack Garfein. It was filmed in black & whiteentirely on location in New York City. The dominating themes in the film are human loneliness & hopelessness. Baker ismarvelous in the role of ""Mary Ann"", a young Brooklyn college student who is brutally raped in a park early in the storyand is unable to deal with the harrowing trauma from it. Mary is about to commit suicide on a bridge when a mechanic(Ralph Meeker as ""Mike"") saves her at the last second. His own life is bleak and empty, as well. He invites her to comewith him back to his drab apartment to rest and sleep for the night, but decides to keep her captive as she ""is his lastchance"" at finding love. After he comes home drunk one night, he physically comes on to her, and she kicks him in theface causing the loss of one eye. In their strange relationship, there is not alot of dialogue between them. It was thisparticular aspect of the picture that really appealed to composer Copland, as it opened up many avenues for him in hisexpressive & dramatic writing. Aaron said, ""The lengthy stretches of silent action invite musical comment in a way thatimbues the whole film with a certain musical 'tone'. It goes, without saying, that one must have an absolute free handin these matters and this was assured me by Jack Garfein and George Justin, respectively the director and producer ofthe film."" A brilliant composer for contemporary urban settings, Copland's score for ""Something Wild"" would be adaptedlater for his piece, ""Music For A Great City"". On first viewing, one is truly guessing trying to see where the film's storyis headed, as it seems there is absolutely no chance for ANY type of normal relationship between the two characters.Heartbreaking and unforgettable, ""Something Wild"" is a stunning, emotionally charged film that was called a ""lost indieclassic"" when it was screened at the New York IFC Center in 2007. The on-location NYC shooting that Garfein used inthe picture, particularly the night downtown scenes, reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's NYC scenes in his 1955 film-noirclassic , ""Killer's Kiss"". The brilliant German director of photography on ""Something Wild"", Eugen Schufftan, would go onone year later in 1962 to win an Academy Award for his work on ""The Hustler"". The opening titles in the film, matchedwith the NYC skyline, were done by the legendary Saul Bass with remarkable effect. ""Something Wild"" was truly a laborof love for Jack Garfein & Carroll Baker -- both paid their own $ to get it completed. When United Artists subsequentlydemanded payment for IOU's on postproduction costs and refused to pay for Copland's scoring fee, Baker completed adeal with UA, as she & Jack had exhausted their funds, to ""pay"" them by doing another movie which would be ""MisterMoses"". $ debt on ""Something Wild"" would then be deducted from her ""Moses"" fee. ""Something Wild"" would be Garfein'slast film, though. A timeless statement about the human condition in the urban jungle, it was controversial when it wasreleased in 1961, as it dealt with a brutal rape and contained brief nudity. Powerful and direct, ""Something Wild"" wouldalso be Aaron Copland's final film score. Kudos to MGM for getting this work finally released on dvd (in full-frame, withno special features or trailer).",5,jazzman,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,3803,"['remember', 'reading', '1961', 'film', 'Something', 'Wild', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'recently', 'learned', 'was', 'released', 'dvdin', '2011', 'MGM', 'limited-edtion', 'collection', 'division', ""'ve"", 'had', 'fine', 'Aaron', 'Copland', 'cd', 'soundtrack', 'years', 'wasreleased', 'Varese', 'Sarabande', '2003', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'stark', 'grim', 'poignant', 'examination', 'ofa', 'young', 'girl', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'experience', 'violence', 'despair', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Something', 'Wild', 'based', 'theAlex', 'Karmel', 'novella', 'Mary', 'Anne', 'was', 'directed', 'Baker', 'then-husband', 'Jack', 'Garfein', 'was', 'filmed', 'black', 'whiteentirely', 'location', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'dominating', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'human', 'loneliness', 'hopelessness', 'Baker', 'ismarvelous', 'role', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'young', 'Brooklyn', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'brutally', 'raped', 'park', 'early', 'storyand', 'unable', 'deal', 'harrowing', 'trauma', 'Mary', 'commit', 'suicide', 'bridge', 'when', 'mechanic', 'Ralph', 'Meeker', 'Mike', 'last', 'second', 'own', 'life', 'bleak', 'empty', 'as', 'well', 'comewith', 'back', 'drab', 'apartment', 'rest', 'sleep', 'night', 'keep', 'captive', 'lastchance', 'finding', 'love', 'home', 'drunk', 'one', 'night', 'physically', 'theface', 'causing', 'loss', 'one', 'eye', 'strange', 'relationship', 'not', 'alot', 'dialogue', 'was', 'thisparticular', 'aspect', 'picture', 'really', 'appealed', 'composer', 'Copland', 'opened', 'up', 'many', 'avenues', 'hisexpressive', 'dramatic', 'writing', 'Aaron', 'said', 'lengthy', 'stretches', 'silent', 'action', 'invite', 'musical', 'comment', 'way', 'whole', 'film', 'certain', 'musical', ""'tone"", 'saying', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'absolute', 'free', 'handin', 'matters', 'was', 'assured', 'Jack', 'Garfein', 'George', 'Justin', 'respectively', 'director', 'producer', 'ofthe', 'film', 'brilliant', 'composer', 'contemporary', 'urban', 'settings', 'Copland', 'score', 'Something', 'Wild', 'would', 'be', 'adaptedlater', 'piece', 'Music', 'A', 'Great', 'City', 'first', 'viewing', 'one', 'truly', 'guessing', 'trying', 'see', 'where', 'film', 'storyis', 'headed', 'absolutely', 'chance', 'ANY', 'type', 'normal', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters.Heartbreaking', 'unforgettable', 'Something', 'Wild', 'stunning', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'film', 'was', 'called', 'lost', 'indieclassic', 'when', 'was', 'screened', 'New', 'York', 'IFC', 'Center', '2007', 'on-location', 'NYC', 'shooting', 'Garfein', 'used', 'inthe', 'picture', 'particularly', 'night', 'downtown', 'scenes', 'reminded', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'NYC', 'scenes', '1955', 'film-noirclassic', 'Killer', 'Kiss', 'brilliant', 'German', 'director', 'photography', 'Something', 'Wild', 'Eugen', 'Schufftan', 'would', 'go', 'onone', 'year', 'later', '1962', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'work', 'Hustler', 'opening', 'titles', 'film', 'matchedwith', 'NYC', 'skyline', 'were', 'done', 'legendary', 'Saul', 'Bass', 'remarkable', 'effect', 'Something', 'Wild', 'was', 'truly', 'laborof', 'love', 'Jack', 'Garfein', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'paid', 'own', 'get', 'completed', 'When', 'United', 'Artists', 'subsequentlydemanded', 'payment', 'IOU', 'postproduction', 'costs', 'refused', 'pay', 'Copland', 'scoring', 'fee', 'Baker', 'completed', 'adeal', 'UA', 'Jack', 'had', 'exhausted', 'funds', 'pay', 'doing', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'MisterMoses', 'debt', 'Something', 'Wild', 'would', 'then', 'be', 'deducted', 'Moses', 'fee', 'Something', 'Wild', 'would', 'be', ""Garfein'slast"", 'film', 'though', 'timeless', 'statement', 'human', 'condition', 'urban', 'jungle', 'was', 'controversial', 'when', 'wasreleased', '1961', 'brutal', 'rape', 'contained', 'brief', 'nudity', 'Powerful', 'direct', 'Something', 'Wild', 'wouldalso', 'be', 'Aaron', 'Copland', 'final', 'film', 'score', 'Kudos', 'MGM', 'getting', 'work', 'finally', 'released', 'dvd', 'full-frame', 'withno', 'special', 'features', 'trailer']",Something Wild

There was a period during the 50's and 60's when American film explored human psychology without reservation.

1514121,A3B6FJBIQS1TD2,B006A8XG7U,Zac R Cocciolo,"[7, 7]","One of the most aggressively strange films I've ever seen, and at the same time also one of the most understated. It's a film where events, even the most horrific and strange, simply happen, and the audience is left to interpret quite a bit. Also one of the few films where its long periods of silence are ruled by the actors and are not purely director-driven. The acting is some of the most piercing and amazing; every line, every look loaded.At face value, this film is somewhat ""culturally questionable"" and ""problematic"", but the more I thought about it, the more, really, it just WASN'T-- what it is is complex and weird and often inexplicable-- just like the actions of real people. Strange to see the cinematographer of Metropolis work so well with this obviously actors-studio inspired film. The film's subtext, and the film is entirely subtext, somehow increases the tension tenfold; there were several times it took me twenty minutes to go ""OH that is what this character meant in that scene before"", and not in a NOW A BIG REVELATION kind of way, but in a quiet epiphany, and that's one of this film's main strengths.Evidently Aaron Copland, on his 80th birthday, when New York was doing some kind of big celebration in his honour, he was asked what piece of his he would like to have performed-- his request was for a screening of Something Wild, and HOT DAMN he did a great job with the score here.
