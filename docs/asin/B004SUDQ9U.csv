The characters were okay,but nothing i would want to see again.I would rather had not seen it honestly.I am not sure that this celebrates any interracial love or justice.It was morely about a slave running for her life and from her slave master where there really was no time for him and her to bond.The ending was just absolutely ridiculous.They chatted for a little, hid, and then ran through the entire movie.There was no romance,and no kiss.Someone sacrificed so much for her, and she did not even give him a kiss.I applaud him for being a gentleman,but the ending was no good.What a ridiculous film.Also, the film never mentioned what happened to her at the ending.",2,"With all the exaggerated reviews,i feel ridiculous thinking this was a little bit of a love story.",1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,924,"['was', 'love', 'story', 'i', 'read', 'reviews.A', 'bit', 'exaggerating.Yes', 'i', 'did', 'enjoy', 'main', 'part', 'story', 'where', 'risked', 'so', 'much', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'i', 'was', 'completely', 'unsatisfied', 'disappointed', 'how', 'low', 'budgeted', 'film', 'seem', 'characters', 'were', 'okay', 'nothing', 'i', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'again.I', 'would', 'rather', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'interracial', 'love', 'justice.It', 'was', 'morely', 'slave', 'running', 'life', 'slave', 'master', 'where', 'really', 'was', 'time', 'bond.The', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous.They', 'chatted', 'little', 'hid', 'then', 'ran', 'entire', 'movie.There', 'was', 'romance', 'kiss.Someone', 'sacrificed', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'give', 'kiss.I', 'applaud', 'being', 'gentleman', 'ending', 'was', 'good.What', 'ridiculous', 'film.Also', 'film', 'never', 'mentioned', 'what', 'happened', 'ending']",N/A

1427546,APKYXHI9GA1UR,B004SUDQ9U,"Viento Weathers ""Viento""","[0, 0]","I was trying to find the movie Rush to buy at Target, but have realized that a new copy of it on Amazon is $47+, so I won't be finding it at Target!  On most days I would probably pay that for Rush, but that's why I'm in debt, so I'll have to settle for a used copy someday soon.  Instead, I found The Journey of August King which I purchased because I was pretty sure I would like it.  It did not disappoint me and is a good movie. I of course was watching it to see Jason Patric, but I was struck by the incredible acting of Thandie Newton as Annalees. The story is of a 17 -year-old runaway slave girl whom Jason Patric as August King can't help but protect from the men hunting her. It's a rather philosophical movie about how whites saw slaves as property and would offer animals and land as rewards for the return of their property. Annalees was the house servant in her master's plantation.  We later discover through the course of the movie that her master is her father. He has an unnatural desire to find her and is distraught that she has run away. We don't really have to imagine why she is running.  The movie unfolds slowly and we learn more about the characters thru the dialogue between Patric and Newton. The hero of the movie, August King, has come to the city from his mountain home to finally pay off his land and obtain the deed and to buy supplies for the rest of the spring and summer. The story is set in spring of 1815. The journey back from town to King's home seems to take forever. Not that it was bad, but I couldn't foresee what was going to happen or how it was going to end. Knowing history and the little subtleties in the movie, I was on the edge of my seat.  It is amazing all of the things King risks and parts with to prevent Annalees from being caught and further harmed.  I was struck that when they pass a May Day Festival that there were no real flowers to be seen anywhere on the beautiful North Carolina landscape; however, when I did notice the flowers Patric picks I had to admit is was great placement in the movie. I was also struck by the gentleness of Patric for the slave girl and for the animals. He was like a father to Annalees and although he is tempted by her beauty, he never does anything inappropriate. The movie has one of the best last lines I can think of in film, and I enjoyed the closing song.  I am definitely glad I watched it. This is a different side to Jason Patric that I had not seen. I always like his characters in the films I have seen him in and know that he will not take a part just to be in a movie, so I respect him for that.  August King has a tenderness and vulnerability and Jason Patric made him very likeable to me. I will continue to watch more of Jason's movies and review them.",4,Gentle and Tender,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,2764,"['was', 'trying', 'find', 'movie', 'Rush', 'buy', 'Target', 'have', 'realized', 'new', 'copy', 'Amazon', '47+', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'finding', 'Target', 'most', 'days', 'would', 'probably', 'pay', 'Rush', 'why', ""'m"", 'debt', ""'ll"", 'have', 'settle', 'used', 'copy', 'someday', 'soon', 'Instead', 'found', 'Journey', 'August', 'King', 'purchased', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'would', 'like', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'good', 'movie', 'course', 'was', 'watching', 'see', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'was', 'struck', 'incredible', 'acting', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'Annalees', 'story', '17', '-year-old', 'runaway', 'slave', 'girl', 'whom', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'August', 'King', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'protect', 'men', 'hunting', 'rather', 'philosophical', 'movie', 'how', 'whites', 'saw', 'slaves', 'property', 'would', 'offer', 'animals', 'land', 'rewards', 'return', 'property', 'Annalees', 'was', 'house', 'servant', 'master', 'plantation', 'later', 'discover', 'course', 'movie', 'master', 'father', 'unnatural', 'desire', 'find', 'distraught', 'run', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'imagine', 'why', 'running', 'movie', 'slowly', 'learn', 'more', 'characters', 'thru', 'dialogue', 'Patric', 'Newton', 'hero', 'movie', 'August', 'King', 'come', 'city', 'mountain', 'home', 'finally', 'pay', 'off', 'land', 'obtain', 'deed', 'buy', 'supplies', 'rest', 'spring', 'summer', 'story', 'set', 'spring', '1815', 'journey', 'back', 'town', 'King', 'home', 'take', 'forever', 'Not', 'was', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'foresee', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'Knowing', 'history', 'little', 'subtleties', 'movie', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'amazing', 'things', 'King', 'risks', 'parts', 'prevent', 'Annalees', 'being', 'caught', 'further', 'harmed', 'was', 'struck', 'when', 'pass', 'May', 'Day', 'Festival', 'were', 'real', 'flowers', 'be', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'beautiful', 'North', 'Carolina', 'landscape', 'however', 'when', 'did', 'notice', 'flowers', 'Patric', 'picks', 'had', 'admit', 'was', 'great', 'placement', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'struck', 'gentleness', 'Patric', 'slave', 'girl', 'animals', 'was', 'father', 'Annalees', 'tempted', 'beauty', 'never', 'anything', 'inappropriate', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'last', 'lines', 'can', 'think', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'closing', 'song', 'am', 'definitely', 'glad', 'watched', 'different', 'side', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'always', 'characters', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'know', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'part', 'just', 'be', 'movie', 'respect', 'August', 'King', 'tenderness', 'vulnerability', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'made', 'very', 'likeable', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'more', 'Jason', 'movies', 'review']",N/A
