I had an unusal headache to take care of and a fun film could help with that. With that purpose, I took two DVDs from the library to stick to the most fun one. One DVD did not work. I opened the box of the other one and realized that the DVD inside is different from the DVD I intended to take. Not only that but the film turned out to be in Italian! Well, what do you do in that situation? Just take what life presents at the moment and enjoy it! I did that and I am happy for having come across it. Licia Maglietta seemed a bit artificial in her acting at the beginning but then after the point she had been left behind the bus, she took her role charmingly. I liked the way Rosalda took the things that came to her pleasantly as time passed and I liked the slow but yet the sweet building of Rosalda and Fernando's relationship. No doubt Venice's scenes were beautiful and I had no more of a headache after the film.

Instead, `Pane e Tulipani' depicts the kind of love that finds you when you aren't even looking for it; a love that transcends and will make a believer out of you.  With beautifully sincere and in tune performances by the ravishing Licia Maglietta (what a looker, proving that age has nothing to do with it) and the wonderfully talented Bruno Ganz, `Pane e Tulipani' remains a favorite of mine, despite the familiarity with some of the clich&eacute;d plot points.  The key to this film is the beautiful way the romantic vibes are spun.  The film is truly enticing and truly felt in the heart.  You believe Rosalba and Fernando's love.

Of course, it doesn't hurt that Maglietta is a breathtakingly vivacious (at the time) 46-year-old and the then-59-year-old Ganz is cut from the Terence Stamp school of on-screen magnetism.Reading English subtitles has never been so effortless as it is here.

When she is accidentally left at a rest stop during a bus tour with her family, Rosalba decides to have an adventure and see Venice.  As usual in this film genre, she meets quirky people and has small but magical things happen.  These are films that depict characters undergoing growth and transformation, and while the details and ending depend on the director's temperament, the film's success depends on the actors' ability.  In the case of Bread &amp; Tulips, an optimistic outlook and a fine cast make this a fun and charming film, perfect for a date where you want to say &quot;Love can be quite nice&quot;.  (Unlike a first dinner/date I had where the guy brought over John Hurt in the bleak and violent &quot;1984&quot;.  Very short relationship.)  The emphasis here is on growth rather than transformation, since Maglietta is so beautiful and joyful that she can't be  100% believable as the bored and boring frumpy housewife.Perhaps you remember Bruno Ganz from Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire?  This is a less divine role for the charismatic Ganz, but here he speaks beautiful Italian, recites poetry and eventually twinkles his eye at the lovely lady in distress.  Though when they meet he has been contemplating suicide, this aspect of the film is neither overemphasized nor played for laughs.There is a sizeable cast, and every one is very good.

I went through it a second time and still find it a delight.The film is not really too realistic in it's treatment, it's more like a comedy or else the story would be too much a cliche. The duties and obligations of life are smothering her inner nature. As a middle class housewife, her routine would be housalchores and her only pastime would be watching TV when pressing clothes and occasionally getting on a family trip. But the husband only cares about taking a picture and her son only listening to discman even on the trip... How her own feelings and urges, say, to make new friends, to play music that she was once so strongly attached to, or do some gardening which she is so talented. It's hardly a life of her own choice. And she manages to do them all in Venice. How?It all started with the family on vacation, taking a trip which sent this housewife back to her innermost urge and feelings. It's presented in a way that it's overbrimming with fun and humour-- not just romance, and in a way the viewers wouldn't find it boring or unconvincing at all.Needless to say, the pleasantness of the leading actress as well as the beautiful sceneries of the city has a lot to do with the success of the film too-- not just the German actor.

The pair of love birds might not be your typical young twenty-something in love. In fact, one is a runaway middle-aged mom, Rosalba(Maglietta Maglietta), and the other is an over-the-hill waiter-slash-romantic poet (Bruno Ganz)who is just about to commit suicide the day he meets her. However, it has all the right ingredients to make it a sweet and charming love story, and an award-winning one at that.If you have never seen Venice in real life, this movie will put you on the narrow streets and alleyways of Venice minus the sewage smell in the summer. As a substitute for the smell, there is a story about the bumbling plumber (Venice does need good plumbers!) who got hired by Rosalba's husband to track her down, and voila, there is your comedic element. The cinematography is breathtaking, as it has become a standard in many top quality European films these days.It is most likely you won't walk away with the thought that this is one of the best movies you have ever seen. It is a fairly accessible piece that has many of the right elements of a superior movie. One complaint is that the segues between reality and Rosalba's imagination are confusing at times, and in my opinion, do not serve much purpose in the narration. Overall, it is an entertaining film that you should catch one of these days. Especially during those days you miss Venice or want to know what it is like.",4,A romantic comedy set in Venice?

And those characters are played by actors who are not given to chewing up scenery, but instead give wonderfully understated perfomances, particularly in the case of Bruno Ganz.At the center of the story are two people who have basically allowed life and circumstances roll over them like a steamroller.  Rosealba is a housewife whose whole being has been given over to tending to the needs of her utterly indifferent family.  The husband's only attention is abusive, while the sons are supremely self-absorbed.On the other end is Fernando, the depressed and suicidal Icelandic waiter, who has to be one of the bleakest characters I have encountered in a long time.Both characters have lost contact with the things that truly bring joy into their respective lives.  Both love music and dancing, and have done neither for years.  When Rosealba, while on a vacation tour with her family, is forgotten and left behind at a busstop, something inside her snaps and she takes matters into her own hands.  Pursuing her own self-interest for perhaps the first time in her life, she makes her way to (unbelievably dry and unpolluted --- ah the movies) Venice, where she encounters a variety of friends and opportunities that awaken in her the desires and interests that have lain dormant for so long.  I particularly enjoyed watching her play the accordion, as she gets very up close and personal with her instrument.  Anyone who is a musician with any skill can relate to the deep emotional bond that can develop between player and instrument, which is a unique bond.  That bond was very well portrayed here.Eventually she is tracked down by a barely competent detective (possessing perhaps the most annoying cell phone in the world), and is made to feel guilty for abandoning her obligations to her family.  She faces up to her responsibilities and returns home.  The movie could have perhaps ended at this point, leaving us a little depressed and wondering what might follow.  I would have preferred an ending along these lines, because it forces the movie viewer to ponder what the future for these characters might be.However, the movie cruises along and wraps up with a happy ending, as Fernando, for perhaps the first time in his life, takes matters into his hands and launches an expedition to retrieve Rosealba.  He succeeds, and the circle of friends (which now includes a much happier detective) returns to Venice, presumably to live happily ever after.Even with an ending as cheesy as that, the performances by the actors allow the viewer to look beyond the occasional flaws of the movie and appreciate what is overall a very satisfying production.",4,Touching and Rewarding,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,2922,"['hands', 'directors', 'actors', 'patient', 'subtle', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'come', 'contrived', 'stupid', 'fortunately', 'are', 'dealing', 'director', 'who', 'story', 'unfold', 'gradually', 'more', 'fully', 'connect', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'chewing', 'up', 'scenery', 'instead', 'give', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'perfomances', 'particularly', 'case', 'Bruno', 'Ganz.At', 'center', 'story', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'basically', 'allowed', 'life', 'circumstances', 'roll', 'steamroller', 'Rosealba', 'housewife', 'whole', 'being', 'been', 'given', 'tending', 'needs', 'utterly', 'indifferent', 'family', 'husband', 'only', 'attention', 'abusive', 'sons', 'are', 'supremely', 'self-absorbed.On', 'other', 'end', 'Fernando', 'depressed', 'suicidal', 'Icelandic', 'waiter', 'who', 'be', 'one', 'bleakest', 'characters', 'have', 'encountered', 'long', 'time.Both', 'characters', 'have', 'lost', 'contact', 'things', 'truly', 'bring', 'joy', 'respective', 'lives', 'love', 'music', 'dancing', 'have', 'done', 'years', 'When', 'Rosealba', 'vacation', 'tour', 'family', 'forgotten', 'left', 'behind', 'busstop', 'something', 'snaps', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Pursuing', 'own', 'self-interest', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'way', 'unbelievably', 'dry', 'unpolluted', 'movies', 'Venice', 'where', 'variety', 'friends', 'opportunities', 'awaken', 'desires', 'interests', 'have', 'lain', 'dormant', 'so', 'long', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'play', 'accordion', 'very', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'instrument', 'Anyone', 'who', 'musician', 'skill', 'can', 'relate', 'deep', 'emotional', 'bond', 'can', 'develop', 'player', 'instrument', 'unique', 'bond', 'bond', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'here.Eventually', 'tracked', 'down', 'barely', 'competent', 'detective', 'possessing', 'perhaps', 'most', 'annoying', 'cell', 'phone', 'world', 'made', 'feel', 'guilty', 'abandoning', 'obligations', 'family', 'up', 'responsibilities', 'returns', 'home', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'perhaps', 'ended', 'point', 'leaving', 'little', 'depressed', 'wondering', 'what', 'might', 'follow', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'ending', 'lines', 'movie', 'viewer', 'ponder', 'what', 'future', 'characters', 'might', 'be.However', 'movie', 'along', 'up', 'happy', 'ending', 'Fernando', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'matters', 'hands', 'expedition', 'retrieve', 'Rosealba', 'circle', 'friends', 'now', 'much', 'happier', 'detective', 'returns', 'Venice', 'presumably', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Even', 'ending', 'as', 'cheesy', 'performances', 'actors', 'allow', 'viewer', 'look', 'occasional', 'flaws', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'what', 'overall', 'very', 'satisfying', 'production']",N/A

A bored, underappreciated housewife escapes her life and finds true love away from the hearth and home.

When she misses the bus from the petrol stop, her husband gets on the mobile and yells at her. She decides to hitchhike to catch up to them...and then on a whim ends  up hitchiking to Venice, where she has never been.And her life begins...in short order, she ends up with a room in the apartment of a kindly waiter with a sad history (he's suicidal when we first meet him), a job with a florist/anarchist, a friend in the form of her neighbor &quot;a holistic masseuse.&quot; She blossoms into a beauty throughout the movie as her many gifts (kindness, wit, love) are recognized by those around her. Meanwhile her family misses her working for them-her husband finds out that his mistress is unwilling to iron his shirts-and wants her back. Her husband, too cheap to hire a real detective, insteads sends a prospective employee (a plumber by training) to find her. This portly character, who has read about 200 too many detective novels, injects tremendous humor into the movie.The movie has many small charms. Though it is shot in Venice, the director only shows typical &quot;beauty&quot; shots in passing. The beauty of the city to the heroine occurs in the small shops and apartments of her newfound life. The acting, particularly of Maglietta, is profound and touching.I would recommend this movie to those who like romances and foreign, art house films.

On a vacation she is accidentally left behind in Venice, and then on a whim decides to stay for awhile.  She needs to breathe free from the domination of her husband who sees her only as an asset and doesn't love her.  Indeed he has a mistress.What she finds in Venice are new warm friends and a certain man, Fernando Girasoli (played with sly finesse by veteran Swiss-born actor Bruno Ganz), who speaks in poetic phrases but wants to hang himself.  She also rediscovers a delight in life and the freedom to be herself and do what she wants to do, which includes playing the accordion and reading Mark Twain in bed.

After her first moments of dismay, she begins to enjoy her brief intermission from family cares and impulsively decides to take a 'vacation' alone in Venice. That 'vacation' quirkily evolves into a 'runaway' scenario. If there had been pictures of  'missing persons' on milk cartons in Italy in 2000, Rosalba's would have appeared among them. She's no teenager, however, just an ordinary repressed not-quite-glamorous middle-aged wife, whose husband takes her (and his mistress) for granted. Rosalba meets people in Venice, attachments development, choices will need to be made ...This is quite a funny film, as zany as a Fellini flick but considerably less pretentious and evasive. It's not ""la Dolce Vita"" by any means, though that's the image the promotion sought. Actually it's a heart-warming love story shaken into a hilarious satire of Italian culture and behavior, like a squirt of vermouth into a gin martini. If anyone but an Italian had produced and directed such a sharp satire of ""comportamento italiano"", the Sons of Columbus would surely have picketed the theaters. Rosalba is hopelessly butter-fingered; her dropping and breaking of trivial objects is used, delicately, as an opener for significant scenes and, I suppose, as a symbol of her dilemma. The supporting characters in the film are indeed bizarre enough for Fellini but they're not treated as existential freaks. The film is kind to human foibles.In Venice, Rosalba is befriended by a elderly waiter who gloomily provides her with a couch to sleep on for a night. The waiter is an Icelander who has lived in Venice much of his life, who somehow has acquired the name 'Girasole' - Sunflower - a ponderously depressed man at the verge of suicide, portrayed brilliantly by the German actor Bruno Ganz. Subtitles probably fail to convey the peculiarity of Girasole's accent in Italian, which is hilarious not so much for his vowels and consonants but for outlandish vocabulary and syntax, half cinema and half archaic, absorbed from reading the 16th C epic poem ""Orlando Furioso"" by Ludovico Ariosto. Ganz nails this role perfectly, and his performance is especially funny for me, since his Italian and mine must sound very similar. Like Girasole, I mash together the Italian I've learned from Baroque operas with th Italian I've picked up from the streets of Roma.""Pane e Tulipani"" won nine 'Donatellos' -- the Italian equivalent of Oscars -- in 2000, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Actor.

583235,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JCKU,Miles D. Moore,"[6, 6]","&quot;Bread and Tulips,&quot; Silvio Soldini's gently hilarious comedy, allows viewers to revel in a lovely story about the renewal of life and hope. It bears some resemblance to &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun,&quot; but benefits from a stronger story and more fully realized characters. It also has some similarities to David Lean's &quot;Summertime&quot;--another beloved movie about a middle-aged woman finding romance in Venice--but the mood in &quot;Bread and Tulips&quot; is more sweet than bittersweet.  Rosalba (Licia Maglietta), a bored housewife, is left behind on vacation with her crabby family when their tour bus leaves without her. Rather than going straight home to Pescara on the Abruzzi coast, she decides on a whim to head up to Venice, where she has never been. From there on in, the movie is very much about the renewal of the spirit--not only Rosalba's, but also that of Fernando (Bruno Ganz), the romantic restaurateur who falls for Rosalba, and Constantino (Giuseppe Battiston), the tubby, sad-sack plumber who reluctantly spies on Rosalba as a prerequisite for getting a job from Rosalba's bossy husband. These three actors give delightful performances, as do the other players in this quirky romantic comedy. Particularly enjoyable for American audiences is that Soldini places us in a Venice rarely seen in the tourist brochures. San Marco and other wonders are seen only in passing; most of the action takes place in Venice's back streets, among the rainbow-hued houses, tiny fountain-centered courtyards, and toy bridges crossing narrow canals. The photography is lovely, and looks sensational in the DVD transfer. &quot;Bread and Tulips&quot; is a two-hour vacation in a sweeter, gentler world.",5,"Gently hilarious, humane, and refreshing",1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,1720,"['quot', 'Bread', 'Tulips', 'quot', 'Silvio', 'Soldini', 'gently', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'viewers', 'revel', 'lovely', 'story', 'renewal', 'life', 'hope', 'resemblance', 'quot', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'quot', 'benefits', 'stronger', 'story', 'more', 'fully', 'realized', 'characters', 'also', 'similarities', 'David', 'Lean', 'quot', 'Summertime', 'quot', 'beloved', 'movie', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'finding', 'romance', 'Venice', 'mood', 'quot', 'Bread', 'Tulips', 'quot', 'more', 'sweet', 'bittersweet', 'Rosalba', 'Licia', 'Maglietta', 'bored', 'housewife', 'left', 'vacation', 'crabby', 'family', 'when', 'tour', 'bus', 'Rather', 'going', 'straight', 'home', 'Pescara', 'Abruzzi', 'coast', 'whim', 'head', 'up', 'Venice', 'where', 'never', 'been', 'there', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'renewal', 'spirit', 'not', 'only', 'Rosalba', 'also', 'Fernando', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'romantic', 'restaurateur', 'who', 'Rosalba', 'Constantino', 'Giuseppe', 'Battiston', 'tubby', 'sad-sack', 'plumber', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'Rosalba', 'prerequisite', 'getting', 'job', 'Rosalba', 'bossy', 'husband', 'three', 'actors', 'give', 'delightful', 'performances', 'do', 'other', 'players', 'quirky', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Particularly', 'enjoyable', 'American', 'audiences', 'Soldini', 'Venice', 'rarely', 'seen', 'tourist', 'brochures', 'San', 'Marco', 'other', 'wonders', 'are', 'seen', 'only', 'passing', 'most', 'action', 'place', 'Venice', 'back', 'streets', 'rainbow-hued', 'houses', 'tiny', 'fountain-centered', 'courtyards', 'toy', 'bridges', 'crossing', 'narrow', 'canals', 'photography', 'lovely', 'sensational', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'quot', 'Bread', 'Tulips', 'quot', 'two-hour', 'vacation', 'sweeter', 'gentler', 'world']",N/A

Feeling adventurous and a little resentful, she decides to hitch a ride home, but ends up in Venice. With little money to spare, she manages to survive for a few days with hopes of getting a job and finding a place to stay.After finding a job in a florist shop and moving in with a waiter named Fernando (who is just about to kill himself it seems), she meets Grazia who bursts into her life asking her to help her with a plumbing disaster.For some reason Rosalba is swept away in this new life and keeps telling her family she will be back soon, yet something strange power seems to overtake her and she decides she too needs a vacation, albeit a working vacation. She spends her time working in the florist shop, reading books in the evening and eating breakfast prepared by Fernando.

Mostly, though, ""Bread and Tulips,"" directed by Silvio Soldini, is about finding the kind of love that enfolds you, lifts you up and boldly takes you with it, in place of the kind that simply allows you to catch hold and follow along.  It's about possibilities; of realizing the fulfillment of the promise instead of forever existing in the shadow of the potential, of recognizing what can be and embracing it once it's found-- a consideration that love in the purest sense does exist, and often in the least likely of places.  It's just a matter of opening the heart, and finding it.Rosalba Barletta (Licia Maglietta) is content with her life, or so it would seem; she's a housewife with two sons-- aged sixteen and eighteen-- and a husband, Mimmo (Antonio Catania), who sells bathroom fixtures.  Her contentment, though, is perhaps due to the fact that she's never considered the possibility of anything being otherwise.  But that changes when, while on vacation with the family, she is inadvertently left behind at a stop.  She watches the tour bus pull away and suddenly realizes that her husband and boys haven't even missed her.She decides to hitchhike home, but on the way, she decides to take a vacation of her own first.  One of her rides is headed to Venice, a city to which she has never been but always wanted to go, and so she makes that her destination.  And her vacation soon becomes more than that; it becomes an experience that opens up a whole new perspective on life to her, an adventure that reawakens her senses and fills her with an appreciation of life and what love really is.  There is bad with the good, however, as it also makes her a woman torn between her old life with the family she loves but who take her for granted, and a new life, in which real love and personal fulfillment is possible.  Whatever she decides, one thing is certain:  This is one vacation Rosalba is never going to forget.Director Soldini has crafted and delivered an engaging and thoroughly involving and thoughtful film that grabs hold of the viewer and sweeps you along with it.  It's funny, romantic and poignant, with a pure joy for life at it's heart; a romantic film in every sense of the word.  Soldini tells Rosalba's story in a way that makes you more than a mere observer, but one who is sharing her life and all that she is feeling.  Rosalba is someone you care about, and it's because Soldini has taken great care in attempting to establish that necessary connection between his character and the audience-- and he succeeds.  He sets a perfect pace, in that Rosalba's growth and awareness is gradual, the product of subtle exploration rather than epiphany, which makes all that transpires entirely credible.  And in the same way, it serves the credibility of the other characters, as well.  It's a very grounded presentation that gives the sense of everything happening in real time; Soldini never allows the story to get ahead of itself, and that's part of the bond he's created that allows the audience to keep living it rather than just watching.The insightful screenplay by Soldini and Doriana Leondeff makes for an engaging film to begin with, but without question, what really sells it is the wonderful performance by Licia Maglietta as Rosalba.  Honest and earthy, her portrayal is entirely convincing and believable; she opens up her character and lets you in, where you discover an inner beauty that is vibrant and endearing.  And you realize how much Rosalba has to give, and how much she wants to give-- and it's a touching experience; this is a woman who receives by giving, and it's gratifying to encounter that kind of charity of soul, and moreover, to see it rewarded in kind.  Most importantly, Maglietta's performance inspires a greater understanding of the human condition; by experiencing the rewards of discovering who Rosalba really is, one may be inclined thereafter to look deeper into others, to reflect upon the nature of those perhaps taken for granted for too long.  And the fact that such an impact can be made through a character in a film attests to the talent and ability of Maglietta, who-- something of a cross between Sophia Loren and Giulietta Masina-- has an absorbing screen presence, and plays Rosalba so beautifully.Bruno Ganz also gives a memorable performance as Fernando Girasoli, the man who befriends Rosalba in Venice.  His portrayal is so subtle and understated, and so giving, in that he allows the focus to remain on Rosalba at all times, that the full impact of his character kind of sneaks up on you.  The initial meeting between Rosalba and Fernando is so indifferent that he at first appears to be nothing more than a peripheral character in the drama.  And it demonstrates how wonderfully Soldini and his actors have integrated the characters with the story to make it play out in such real terms.  It's an affecting performance by Ganz, who sparks an unlikely chemistry with Maglietta that works so well on the screen.Also turning in performances worthy of mention are Marina Massironi, as Rosalba's friend, Grazia, the holistic beautician/masseuse; and Giuseppe Battiston, as Costantino, the hapless plumber/detective.The supporting cast includes Felice Andreasi (Fermo), Tiziano Cucchiarelli (Nic), Matteo Febo (Salvo), Tatiana Lepore (Adele) and Vitalba Andrea (Ketty).  Highly entertaining and thoroughly involving on a very personal level, ""Bread and Tulips"" is a film that provides an unforgettable emotional experience; one that promotes a deeper understanding of human nature by allowing you to get outside of yourself, which ultimately affords a fresh perspective on life and the way we live it.",5,A Warm Perspective on Life,1027123200,"07 20,

Upset by their indifference to her, she decides to visit Venice before she goes home to a family that does not appreciate her.Needing dinner after arriving at her pensione (bed and breakfast) she goes to a tratoria (family style restaurant) and meets Fernando, the waiter, played by the fine German actor, Bruno Ganz, whom some viewers may have seen in Wim Wenders wonderful films.  Rosalba is short of cash and ends up staying with Fernando in his apartment.Rosalba senses the loneliness and sadness in Fernando.  He has a noose to hang himself hidden under his bed.  She does her best to cheer him up by making his dingy apartment an attractive place to live.Rosalba soon finds work with an eccentric florist and decides to stay with Fernando.  She is a warm, attractive woman who makes life better for everyone she meets.  She seems in no hurry to go home to her family.Her husband decides to send a plumber, who has come looking for work, to Venice to find his wife.  This subplot adds much humor to the story.  Each of the characters has some unique quality which makes them memorable.  Rosalba is so warm and friendly that everyone who meets her likes her and wants to help her.  She may not be needed by her family, but she quickly becomes important to her small circle of friends in Venice.What makes this film special is first the performances, which are first-rate. Licia Maglietta as Rosalba is wonderful.  She is just the sort of person we would like to know.  She is warm, friendly, genuinely interested in others, and talented.  All the supporting players are drawn to her and are better for knowing her.Bruno Ganz as Fernando is wearied by all the dashed hopes and disappointments of his life, which may have gotten the better of him had he not met Rosalba.  He is the moon, dark and brooding, to Rosalba's sun.The story is well directed and well told.  Enough quirky and unusual characters come on the scene to keep our interest high.  Clearly the director wants to show us Italians as they really are, not so much descendants of the Romans as a pompous tour guide suggests, but silly and flawed like the rest of us.

583263,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00005JCKU,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 6]","""Bread and Tulips,"" (2000), a popular, full-color Italian romantic comedy comes complete with crowd-pleasing charm and lovely photography of Venice, the ancient city on the Adriatic, possibly the most romantic of cities. The film was directed by Silvio Soldini who also co-wrote it with Doriana Leondeff. It won nine David di Donatello Awards, the Italian Oscar equivalent, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor.In this not terribly original road movie, Rosalba Barletta (played by the intelligent actress Licia Maglietta), a 40-year old cosseted, unhappy Pescara housewife who's taken for granted by her philandering, self-centered husband (Antonio Catania), begins to blossom.  Initially, her family thinks so little of her that they allow the tour bus to leave her behind at a service area en route. (In a foretelling of the future, she's dropped her wedding ring down the toilet and must fish it out.)  So she decides to leave her drab life behind for a bit, and hitchhikes to beautiful Venice, which she's never seen.  She finds a job with Fermo, an anarchistic florist; the ingratiating Grazia, a trendy friend; and bella fortuna as she starts to construct a new life for herself. And she begins a tentative relationship with the man who has given her a room, the taciturn Fernando Girasole, a lonely, suicidal waiter supposedly from Iceland (the magnetic resourceful actor Bruno Ganz,Downfall [DVD],Wings of Desire,Unknown).  Acting is uniformly good, and cinematography does Venice justice.The film does not get overly sentimental, or sexy: the nice middle aged romance - and how often do we see one -- between the principals is played with restraint, and the actors keep their clothes on, thank goodness.  It's a gentle, sweet and funny fairy tale, charming and engaging as all get out, and about as far as you can get from the previous prevailing school of Italian film making, realism. For better or worse, I prefer something saltier, with a bit more bite, perhaps, a tincture of bitterness, but we all know what we like.",3,I Prefer Something Saltier with a Bit More Bite,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,2109,"['Bread', 'Tulips', '2000', 'popular', 'full-color', 'Italian', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'complete', 'crowd-pleasing', 'charm', 'lovely', 'photography', 'Venice', 'ancient', 'city', 'Adriatic', 'possibly', 'most', 'romantic', 'cities', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Silvio', 'Soldini', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'Doriana', 'Leondeff', 'won', 'nine', 'David', 'di', 'Donatello', 'Awards', 'Italian', 'Oscar', 'equivalent', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor.In', 'not', 'terribly', 'original', 'road', 'movie', 'Rosalba', 'Barletta', 'played', 'intelligent', 'actress', 'Licia', 'Maglietta', '40-year', 'old', 'cosseted', 'unhappy', 'Pescara', 'housewife', 'who', 'taken', 'granted', 'philandering', 'self-centered', 'husband', 'Antonio', 'Catania', 'blossom', 'Initially', 'family', 'so', 'little', 'allow', 'tour', 'bus', 'leave', 'behind', 'service', 'area', 'route', 'foretelling', 'future', 'dropped', 'wedding', 'ring', 'down', 'toilet', 'must', 'fish', 'out', 'leave', 'drab', 'life', 'bit', 'hitchhikes', 'beautiful', 'Venice', 'never', 'seen', 'job', 'Fermo', 'anarchistic', 'florist', 'ingratiating', 'Grazia', 'trendy', 'friend', 'bella', 'fortuna', 'construct', 'new', 'life', 'herself', 'tentative', 'relationship', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'room', 'taciturn', 'Fernando', 'Girasole', 'lonely', 'suicidal', 'waiter', 'supposedly', 'Iceland', 'magnetic', 'resourceful', 'actor', 'Bruno', 'Ganz', 'Downfall', '[', 'DVD', ']', 'Wings', 'Desire', 'Unknown', 'Acting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'cinematography', 'Venice', 'justice.The', 'film', 'not', 'get', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'sexy', 'nice', 'middle', 'aged', 'romance', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'one', 'principals', 'played', 'restraint', 'actors', 'keep', 'clothes', 'thank', 'goodness', 'gentle', 'sweet', 'funny', 'fairy', 'tale', 'charming', 'engaging', 'get', 'out', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'get', 'previous', 'prevailing', 'school', 'Italian', 'film', 'making', 'realism', 'better', 'worse', 'prefer', 'something', 'saltier', 'bit', 'more', 'bite', 'perhaps', 'tincture', 'bitterness', 'know', 'what', 'like']",N/A
