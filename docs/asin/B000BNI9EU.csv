945495,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000BNI9EU,calvinnme,"[5, 5]","This documentary is a view of life on earth before the dinosaurs. The film begins with the creation of the Moon by the impact of the hypothetical planet Theia with the Earth. Starting with the Cambrian period 530 million years ago, the evolution of life on earth is documented, starting with the earliest of man's ancestors, the Haikouicthys, an orange ""fish"" the size of a thumbnail. The progress of the sea-dwelling creatures is charted as they evolve into being able to exist on land and ends where the documentary ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" picks up, at the end of the Triassic period, with the first dinosaurs walking the earth and forcing the smaller mammalian creatures into a nocturnal existence of hiding.DVD extras include a thirty-minute documentary entitled Trilogy of Life. This documentary covers all of the Walking with series (Dinosaurs, Beasts, and Monsters). There are numerous interviews with the filmmakers and producers of the series. There is even footage of the real locations and backgrounds before the animated beasts were inserted by computer. It's funny to see the filmmakers kicking up dust and moving trees with wires ""pretending"" to be the dinosaurs since the dinosaurs would be inserted later.The documentary itself is presented with a great deal of detail and authority, as if the filmmakers know for a fact that this is exactly what took place, when in fact it is all quite hypothetical. However, you have to watch it understanding that its purpose is not to present an academic thesis. Instead, its purpose is to bring prehistory to life, just as if you were watching present-day animals being filmed, complete with animated prehistoric beasts occasionally bumping into an imaginary camera.My stepchildren absolutely love this documentary. This film just goes to prove that science can be made interesting, inviting the viewer to further investigate what is being presented. That is the purpose of the film, and it does succeed brilliantly.",5,Great piece of animation explores life before the dinosaur,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,1972,"['documentary', 'view', 'life', 'earth', 'dinosaurs', 'film', 'creation', 'Moon', 'impact', 'hypothetical', 'planet', 'Theia', 'Earth', 'Starting', 'Cambrian', 'period', '530', 'million', 'years', 'ago', 'evolution', 'life', 'earth', 'documented', 'starting', 'earliest', 'man', 'ancestors', 'Haikouicthys', 'orange', 'fish', 'size', 'thumbnail', 'progress', 'sea-dwelling', 'creatures', 'charted', 'evolve', 'being', 'able', 'exist', 'land', 'where', 'documentary', 'Walking', 'Dinosaurs', 'up', 'end', 'Triassic', 'period', 'first', 'dinosaurs', 'walking', 'earth', 'forcing', 'smaller', 'mammalian', 'creatures', 'nocturnal', 'existence', 'hiding.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'thirty-minute', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Trilogy', 'Life', 'documentary', 'Walking', 'series', 'Dinosaurs', 'Beasts', 'Monsters', 'are', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'filmmakers', 'producers', 'series', 'even', 'footage', 'real', 'locations', 'backgrounds', 'animated', 'beasts', 'were', 'inserted', 'computer', 'funny', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'kicking', 'up', 'dust', 'moving', 'trees', 'wires', 'pretending', 'be', 'dinosaurs', 'dinosaurs', 'would', 'be', 'inserted', 'later.The', 'documentary', 'presented', 'great', 'deal', 'detail', 'authority', 'filmmakers', 'know', 'fact', 'exactly', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'when', 'fact', 'quite', 'hypothetical', 'However', 'have', 'watch', 'understanding', 'purpose', 'not', 'present', 'academic', 'thesis', 'Instead', 'purpose', 'bring', 'prehistory', 'life', 'just', 'were', 'watching', 'present-day', 'animals', 'being', 'filmed', 'complete', 'animated', 'prehistoric', 'beasts', 'occasionally', 'bumping', 'imaginary', 'camera.My', 'stepchildren', 'absolutely', 'love', 'documentary', 'film', 'just', 'prove', 'science', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'interesting', 'inviting', 'viewer', 'further', 'investigate', 'what', 'being', 'presented', 'purpose', 'film', 'succeed', 'brilliantly']",Before the Dinosaurs: Walking With Monsters
945496,A14Z16YEVJ16JG,B000BNI9EU,Clayton B.,"[0, 0]","I found this ""walking with"" to be very good, even in comparison to Dinosaurs and Beasts. I liked how they made it different from the others; such as showing the evolution from one era to the next and the insides of some of the animals.They also didn't make it as long as the others, but it was actually better having shorter. I found it easier to watch.There was one thing i didn't like about it and that was some of the effects. Although the cgi upclose seemed to work, the animatronics weren't as impressive as the previous films. The parts that get me (and if you haven't seen it yet you may want to skip this!) are the ones such as where the giant spider attacked the petrolacosaurus and it was half cgi and half puppet. Why wouldn't they have just done it all cg? another one was where the chasmatosaurs attacked the lystrosaurs in the river. At one point the animatronic chasmatosaur bites the lystrosaurus and there is a spray of blood, which is clearly being done by someone off camera. However the lystrosaur animatronics are quite well done, especially considering its operating in the water. I forgot to mention, the chasmatosaur puppets have no intricate movements at all. There jaws are always open, there eyes never shut, there tounges nor nostrils don't move at all. At one point they're on the beach apparently sunbathing, and they don't move at all. They even used the same head in the water as they did on land! Other than those slight mishaps, the special effetcs were top notch.All the episodes are wonderful, and they all have intresting animals, spectacular effects, great storylines and up-to-date facts squeezed in. However the last episode was kind of short and not as good as the others. It kind of lacked content, but it works. the bonus features on this disc are also quite enjoyable.I'm glad i bought this DVD, and if you liked Walking with dinosaurs and prehistoric beasts, you'll love this adventure through the beginnings of our world.",5,An awesome look at before the dinosaurs!,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,1967,"['found', 'walking', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'comparison', 'Dinosaurs', 'Beasts', 'liked', 'how', 'made', 'different', 'others', 'such', 'showing', 'evolution', 'one', 'era', 'next', 'insides', 'animals.They', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'long', 'others', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'having', 'shorter', 'found', 'easier', 'watch.There', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'effects', 'cgi', 'upclose', 'seemed', 'work', 'animatronics', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'impressive', 'previous', 'films', 'parts', 'get', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'are', 'ones', 'such', 'where', 'giant', 'spider', 'attacked', 'petrolacosaurus', 'was', 'half', 'cgi', 'half', 'puppet', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'done', 'cg', 'one', 'was', 'where', 'chasmatosaurs', 'attacked', 'lystrosaurs', 'river', 'one', 'point', 'animatronic', 'chasmatosaur', 'lystrosaurus', 'spray', 'blood', 'clearly', 'being', 'done', 'someone', 'camera', 'However', 'lystrosaur', 'animatronics', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'considering', 'operating', 'water', 'forgot', 'mention', 'chasmatosaur', 'puppets', 'have', 'intricate', 'movements', 'jaws', 'are', 'always', 'open', 'eyes', 'never', 'shut', 'tounges', 'nostrils', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'one', 'point', ""'re"", 'beach', 'apparently', 'sunbathing', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'even', 'used', 'same', 'head', 'water', 'did', 'land', 'Other', 'slight', 'mishaps', 'special', 'effetcs', 'were', 'top', 'episodes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'have', 'intresting', 'animals', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'great', 'storylines', 'up-to-date', 'facts', 'squeezed', 'However', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'kind', 'short', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'kind', 'lacked', 'content', 'bonus', 'disc', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'enjoyable.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'bought', 'DVD', 'liked', 'Walking', 'dinosaurs', 'prehistoric', 'beasts', ""'ll"", 'love', 'adventure', 'beginnings', 'world']",Before the Dinosaurs: Walking With Monsters

945499,AY12DBB0U420B,B000BNI9EU,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Dinosaurs are the world's favorite fossils. Without question. From Barney to Jurassic Park to major natural history museums, Dinosaurdepictions are everywhere. But Dinosaurs lived only during the Mesozoic Era (about 170 million years long) and that is but a short segment in the total 4.l billion-year history of life as is represented by the fossil record. Well, it seems, justly or unjustly, that Dinosaurs get all the press. I teach a course in fossils and the history of life (a junior-level course) at San Diego State University and, believe me, there's an abundance of exceptionally interesting fossils in the record other than Dinosaurs. The ""Walking With Monsters: Before the Dinosaurs)"" DVD  attempts to portray that record from the first appearance of substantial-sized fossils (Cambrian time) well up into the time of the Dinosaurs. In my opinion, it partially succeeds and partially falls short. Don;t get me wrong. I like the DVD and regard it as a wonderful first step.Fossils consist of preserved teeth and bones and a variety of traces such as footprints. They must be painstakingly extracted from the rock record, studied with great care, curated and exhibited in one way or another. From that as a beginning, an incredible amount of overlapping interpretations are added and some of these are nothing but pure speculation. For example, fossils don't make noises so when you view this interesting DVD, all the growling, hissing, roaring or whatever sounds you might hear are nothing but pure imagination. Most of the appearances of these life forms is in the interpretation of the artists and how realistic they might be is open to question. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against all of this interpretation. It's part of the fun of paleontology. But when I view reconstructions such as in this DVD (or in Dinosaur DVDs for that matter), I have my own ways of interpreting things and I can get highly critical. But alas, the DVD is meant for the entertainment and education of the general public, and I'm inclined to think it does this rather well,One of the  things that always gripes me is that about 80% of Dinosaurs are herbiverous (live on plants as food), but about 80% of Dinosaur depictions are devoted to carniverous varieties. It seems that an abnormal interest in blood and gore and violence prevails. Why is this? Well, in this ""Walking With Monsters"" DVD, it's the same way. I guess people just want to see blood and gore and movie directors enjoy giving it to them. Action! I mean, who wants to watch a herd of something or other peacefully grazing? But, I'd be saying that you'd be watching a very distorted picture of the history of life in viewing these DVDs, wonderful though they might be. In any case, that's just one of my personal quirks.The DVD is broken into three parts with the first part ranging from about Cambrian time well up into Silurian time. Most of the historical depictions in this segment are of marine forms of life and that conforms precisely with the fossil record. The second part of the DVD depicts life from about The Devonian Period up through the Carboniferous Period and into the Permian Period. This is a time when life gradually emerges from an aquatic environment and becomes ever more adapted to the land. The third segment is from the Permian Period well up into the time of the Dinosaurs and almost all of the depicted life is terrestrial. The organization is appropriate and well done.I could quibble about the marine reptiles, but I won't. Now, the history of life is very complex and cannot be captured in a one-hour DVD. I would say that each of these three episodes should be expanded into a full DVD in themselves, The ""Walking With Monsters"" DVD is a good start, but it attempts to cover too much territory. In any case, I enjoyed the DVD and don't have any hesitation to awarding it five stars.Gary Peterson",5,The Pre-Dinosaur World Comes to Life.,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,3888,"['Dinosaurs', 'are', 'world', 'favorite', 'fossils', 'question', 'Barney', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'major', 'natural', 'history', 'museums', 'Dinosaurdepictions', 'are', 'everywhere', 'Dinosaurs', 'lived', 'only', 'Mesozoic', 'Era', '170', 'million', 'years', 'long', 'short', 'segment', 'total', '4.l', 'billion-year', 'history', 'life', 'represented', 'fossil', 'record', 'Well', 'justly', 'unjustly', 'Dinosaurs', 'get', 'press', 'teach', 'course', 'fossils', 'history', 'life', 'junior-level', 'course', 'San', 'Diego', 'State', 'University', 'believe', 'abundance', 'exceptionally', 'interesting', 'fossils', 'record', 'other', 'Dinosaurs', 'Walking', 'Monsters', 'Dinosaurs', 'DVD', 'attempts', 'portray', 'record', 'first', 'appearance', 'substantial-sized', 'fossils', 'Cambrian', 'time', 'well', 'up', 'time', 'Dinosaurs', 'opinion', 'partially', 'partially', 'short', 'Don', 't', 'get', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'regard', 'wonderful', 'first', 'step.Fossils', 'consist', 'preserved', 'teeth', 'bones', 'variety', 'traces', 'such', 'footprints', 'must', 'be', 'painstakingly', 'extracted', 'rock', 'record', 'studied', 'great', 'care', 'curated', 'exhibited', 'one', 'way', 'From', 'beginning', 'incredible', 'amount', 'overlapping', 'interpretations', 'are', 'added', 'are', 'nothing', 'pure', 'speculation', 'example', 'fossils', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'noises', 'so', 'when', 'view', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'growling', 'hissing', 'roaring', 'sounds', 'might', 'hear', 'are', 'nothing', 'pure', 'imagination', 'Most', 'appearances', 'life', 'forms', 'interpretation', 'artists', 'how', 'realistic', 'might', 'be', 'open', 'question', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'have', 'nothing', 'interpretation', 'part', 'fun', 'paleontology', 'when', 'view', 'reconstructions', 'such', 'DVD', 'Dinosaur', 'DVDs', 'matter', 'have', 'own', 'ways', 'interpreting', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'highly', 'critical', 'alas', 'DVD', 'meant', 'entertainment', 'education', 'general', 'public', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'think', 'rather', 'well', 'One', 'things', 'always', 'about', '80', '%', 'Dinosaurs', 'are', 'herbiverous', 'live', 'plants', 'food', '80', '%', 'Dinosaur', 'depictions', 'are', 'devoted', 'carniverous', 'varieties', 'abnormal', 'interest', 'blood', 'gore', 'violence', 'prevails', 'Why', 'Well', 'Walking', 'Monsters', 'DVD', 'same', 'way', 'guess', 'people', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'blood', 'gore', 'movie', 'directors', 'enjoy', 'giving', 'Action', 'mean', 'who', 'watch', 'herd', 'something', 'other', 'peacefully', 'grazing', ""'d"", 'be', 'saying', ""'d"", 'be', 'watching', 'very', 'distorted', 'picture', 'history', 'life', 'viewing', 'DVDs', 'wonderful', 'might', 'be', 'case', 'just', 'one', 'personal', 'quirks.The', 'DVD', 'broken', 'three', 'parts', 'first', 'part', 'ranging', 'Cambrian', 'time', 'well', 'up', 'Silurian', 'time', 'Most', 'historical', 'depictions', 'segment', 'are', 'marine', 'forms', 'life', 'conforms', 'precisely', 'fossil', 'record', 'second', 'part', 'DVD', 'life', 'Devonian', 'Period', 'Carboniferous', 'Period', 'Permian', 'Period', 'time', 'when', 'life', 'gradually', 'aquatic', 'environment', 'ever', 'more', 'adapted', 'land', 'third', 'segment', 'Permian', 'Period', 'well', 'up', 'time', 'Dinosaurs', 'almost', 'depicted', 'life', 'terrestrial', 'organization', 'appropriate', 'well', 'done.I', 'could', 'quibble', 'marine', 'reptiles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Now', 'history', 'life', 'very', 'complex', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'captured', 'one-hour', 'DVD', 'would', 'say', 'three', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'expanded', 'full', 'DVD', 'Walking', 'Monsters', 'DVD', 'good', 'start', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'territory', 'case', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hesitation', 'awarding', 'five', 'stars.Gary', 'Peterson']",Before the Dinosaurs: Walking With Monsters

Instead, it is a magnificent flight of imagination based upon some real science but which does not let the science take precedence over the wonder. It is wonderfulThis is a series of three programs. Each deals with prehistoric life before the advent of the dinosaurs.In the first program, we are treated to one theory of the formation of our planet and introduced to the Cambrian seas. There are not dinosaurs here. Fish barely even exist. That does not stop the cycle of predation in a world of gigantic marine scorpions and the proto-fish prey. We see the colonization of the land by the first plants and encounter the first amphibians, learning a little bit about the evolutionary pressures that drove their emergence. The program ends with the first true reptiles and the hard shelled egg.The second episode takes place more on land. Gigantic arthropods contest with gigantic amphibians and the odd reptile here and there. We see the first strains of reptile that will eventually give rise to the mammals. Life is still a contest of the predator and the prey.The third episode advances the story through the lives of some early, pre-dinosaur reptiles. The motif of eat and be eaten is still the rule of the day. The episode ends with the apprearance of true dinosaurs, where the series first began.There is a lot of speculation in this work. Some of it is well reasoned and logical. Some of it is much less so. Only a few species are looked at with any degree of detail. The great Devonian age of the fishes is bypassed in a short sentence. That does not stop the wonder of it all. It is fascinating seeing the fossils come to life even with the speculations.The DVD also includes a ""making of"" segment which covers all three of the series.

Perhaps they raised them. but in their defense they use what modern reptiles would do and interpolate it onto this show. I have the whole series on dvd and when I saw them on tv I was amazed.

Now on natgeo you may see similiar shows but these shows were breakthroughs and can give people a greater insight into the pastworlds of the creatures before the dinosaurs. Which are very interesting. I do wonder though if protomammals didn't have hair on them. It may be that they did in fact look as hairy as todays mammals.Not in this show though. kids over 7 should enjoy this show immensely. And adults like me can't get enough.

The show clocks in at 90 minutes; 3 episodes of 30 minutes each.  Each episode focuses on one time period; all of which occurred before the Jurassic rule of dinosaurs.  The show features creatures as diverse as sea scorpions, giant millipedes, orthocones, unusual-looking sharks, predatory lobe-finned fish, huge dragonflies, primitive crocodiles, and the famous sailback reptiles Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus.  This diversity of wildlife is greater than the other Walking with Dinosaurs serials.  The show is filmed like a nature documentary with minimal human presence, unlike some other dinosaur specials.  Of course, the show's creators have taken creative license with the vocalizations, skin tones, and behaviors of the featured animals, but this is necessary to make the show enjoyable.

945509,A1Q70VG2H1CFGR,B000BNI9EU,Nick Spreitzer,"[23, 27]","Seems that Tim Haines and BBC decided to follow in George Lucas' footsteps. Making what would be best accepted by the public first, then completing the series later with the more controversial stuff (if Lucas had made the Phantom Menace first, no one would know what Star Wars is today - the story is far too complicated).Walking With Dinosaus and Prehistoric Beasts were both quite good, except the narration by Kenneth Branaugh, who seemed like he could care aless about what he was talking about and give the impression that these animals were failures (which they were not!) There are some things about the series that I didn't like, mostly the animatronics and some facts, nitpicking stuff.Walking With Monsters, in my humble oppinion is the least strong of the series for the following reasons. 1: It was too short. 2: The animals didn't act as naturalistically as they did in the others (spiders don't stab and stab their prey like a human murderer, they jab and then wait for their poison to take affect). 3: It seemed rushed - sequences that should have taken 30 minutes took half that.Despite these fallbacks, the CG is quite good, animatronics was used VERY sparingly and the Dimetrodon sequence is GREAT! It was my favorite of all of them. I would recommend this DVD just to complete the Walking With story. If you want more on PreDinosaurs, go for The Shape of Life DVD set. It's GREAT. So, on it's own, Walking With Monsters is a waste of time (in my oppinion), but with Walking With Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Beasts, it works fairly well. And despite all the series' fallbacks, everyone should have the complete series in their collection.Other Great Dino Series: When Dinosaurs Roamed America, WWD: Chased By Dinosaurs, Dinosaur Planet.

945511,AGG817S7218AE,B000BNI9EU,Richard Hayward,"[4, 4]","I just enjoyed watching the abridged movie length version yesterday.  I enjoyed this much more than the other chapters of the story (Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Beasts).  Walking with Monsters appears to me to have a number of advantages.Firstly, the animation appears to me to be more believable, at least in parts.  The animals appear more at home in their environment, and less clunky.  Though I can appreciate that this view would differ from person to person: at the time this thought occurred to me, someone spoke out to say that it looked fake!Secondly, the narration by Kenneth Brannagh is much easier to listen to.  It is less overbearing, and less obtrusive.  The images and the story carry more weight than his voice acting in this ""speculation"".Thirdly, the story gives more emphasis on the theories especially relating to evolution, and less on the dramatisation of the lives of animals.  It was particularly effective to see the changing shape of the animals postulated through evolution, and to have the periods/eras of time clearly highlighted.  We have a poster of these time periods and our eight year old enjoyed referring to these while we watched the DVD.  He especially delighted in hearing about our ancestry being traced back to the fish!Overall the series is a great achievement, and I'm sure has made some advancements towards society's understanding of the concepts that we can gather from our prehistory.

945513,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B000BNI9EU,Theo,"[1, 1]","There are pluses and minuses with this one. The single biggest upside is that as with all the ""Walking with... "" shows, it  is both beautiful and wondrous to behold, regardless of what you might think of the content on any deeper level. Of course, as with all the shows in this franchise there are occasional moments where the special effects don't quite come off. This time around the main problem is that here and there the CGI is just a little bit too smooth, making you suddenly all too aware that it is indeed only CGI. But such moments are very much the exception rather than the rule. Overall, this is an amazing thing to watch. It presents us with visions of incredible, alien landscapes that must surely enthral any thinking, feeling person. And because of all the shows in this series this is the one dealing with the time farthest removed from our own, it is also the one that offers us a view into certainly the most alien, and arguably the most enthralling worlds of all.That said, there are also some viable criticisms of this work.First of all, we might as well acknowledge that like all the shows in the franchise it is a seamless melding of real science, pure speculation, and a great deal that is somewhere in between. The series creators accept as much, but some palaeontologists quite understandably object to this blend. They would like it to be made clearer where the real science ends and the speculation begins. I am not entirely unsympathetic to this view. But the actual rights and wrongs of the issue aside, from a viewer's perspective I think the way to get the most out of this work is to approach it much in much same spirit asDestination Moon- the very first item I reviewed here on Amazon.Destination Moon is a pioneering ""hard"" science fiction movie made in 1949 and first screened in 1950. It told the story of a lunar mission with as much realism as it could muster based on the actual science and technology of the day. And taken simply for what it is, Destination Moon is superb. The lunar landscape backdrops painted by famed space artist Chesley Bonestell are incredible to look upon even today. Were they 100% accurate? Of course not. But they weren't a complete fantasy either. They were a reasonable ""best guess"" given the information available. And over and above all that, they were amazing feats of imagination, wondrous to behold. It's the same deal here.My own main criticism of Walking with Monsters would be its sheer brevity. WhileWalking with DinosaursandWalking with Beastsboth had six episodes apiece, this one comes in with a scant three episodes in total. My reservations here aren't just a matter of wanting more, or of wanting better value for money. All of the episodes in the previous two shows focused almost entirely on a single period; a single self-contained world. That is not the case with Walking with Monsters. In fact, we actually jump around in time quite a bit. This often leaves us feeling that we've only been given a glimpse into a world that we really would have liked to have gotten to know better. To have explored more fully.So much for the show itself. Now how about this release? To be honest, there is one small thing I truly hate about it. It has a rather lengthy advertisement for the whole ""Walking with... "" franchise that plays automatically every time you load the disk, and which you cannot skip through. I know this is just an annoyance, but it is... well, annoying! I have no problem with a studio including  promotional material on a disk, but being _forced_ to watch this material every single time I load the disk gets old real quick. Especially when I've already paid out my own good money to actually own the disk, it's almost kind of insulting.The extras are a bit wanting too. There is no commentary over the episodes themselves; only a 30 minute documentary that in fact covers all of the three ""Walking with... ""  programs (Dinosaurs, Beasts, and Monsters) in the trilogy. It's okay I guess. It's nothing special, and it's certainly not especially concerned with Walking with Monsters. It actually spends far more time discussing the first program in the franchise, Walking with Dinosaurs. Frankly, we are left feeling that this program, the third and final instalment, was far from being the climax, almost an afterthought for its creators. I suppose that would explain the brevity.Of course, in talking about ""Walking with... "" only as a trilogy, that naturally enough begs the question: isn'tWalking With Cavemenpart of the franchise? And what about theThe Ballad of Big Al,Chased by DinosaursandChased By Sea Monsters? Aren't they part of the story too?Well, apparently not - at least, not so far as the creators themselves are concerned! In that little 30 minute documentary I mentioned earlier, they consistently talk of the sequence only as a trilogy, apparently excluding Big Al, the Cavemen series, and those two ""Chased by... "" programs, all of which were actually made prior to Walking with Monsters. But truth be told, that's fine with me.The Ballard of Big Al was always a kind of add on, an extra. And although Big Al was good, in all the rest of those shows they committed what I personally consider the colossal mistake of dispensing with voice-only narration. Instead they used an on-camera presenter who was depicted as actually being physically present in the prehistoric world. That just did not work. Frankly, it all came across as a bit silly. In fairness, Robert Winston, who narrated Walking with Cavemen, did do the job as well as it could have been done. The failure was not his - it was in the decision to have anyone do that particular job at all. Nigel Marven on the other hand, who was the presenter in the remaining outings, was an absolute clown whose performance was never anything other than wince-worthy. His constant fretting over the ""danger"" posed by the CGI monsters was simply ridiculous. Maybe he appealed to the six year olds, but that's about all that could be said of him. I don't know whether to lay the blame on him personally or on the writers and director, but either way it's not overstating things to say that his performance really did ruin the shows he appeared in.So to conclude on a final positive note, one thing I definitely appreciated about Walking with Monsters was that it returned to the style of presentation that served this meta-series so well right from its inception. Kenneth Branagh has been restored as our voice-only narrator, and all's right with the world.Theo.",4,"It's Good, But...",1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,6530,"['are', 'pluses', 'minuses', 'one',

945514,A14H1LDN62P89U,B000BNI9EU,ttarkA113,"[3, 3]","Before the Dinosaurs - Walking with Monsters is the third installment from the ""walking with - trilogy of life"" series. Finishing in the beginning, this is the story of life at the beginning up to when the dinosaurs reign started to take off. This is a very good documentary, although it is not as ""near-flawless"" as the other two. (""Walking with Dinosaurs"" and ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"")One of the major complaints is that it is way too short! Being only half as long as its predecessors caused it to be much too rushed. As soon as you've gotten familiar with the location you're in, it's off to the next one. As time was reduced, many plot elements would have to be left out, and of course predation wasn't one of them. There's just a little too much here, and it would have been nice if less of the focus was on this subject. (some of it is quite unrealistic and overly graphic)Also added elements not shown at all in the first two were evolution cut-scenes, and the inside of animal anatomy. Seeing as how this is part of the trilogy, they could have kept the overall structure the same, but unfortunately that's not the case.These complaints aside though, overall it is still a very enjoyable series. And it is still similar enough to feel very much a part of its predecessors. As usual the locations are perfect prehistoric habitats (although some are partially recreated with CGI) and the CGI models are superb and look outstandingly real. There are hardly any animatronics in this program, but that is due to the fact that the close-ups now look much more convincing in CGI than they did a few years ago.""Trilogy of Life"" is a very interesting 30 min. extra, covering the creation of all three programs. (including footage of tests for ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" before the series was even in production)So although not quite perfect, still a satisfying completion to the ""walking with - trilogy of life"", highly recommended!",3,"""Walking with Monsters - Life Before Dinosaurs""!",1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,1939,"['Dinosaurs', 'Walking', 'Monsters', 'third', 'installment', 'walking', 'trilogy', 'life', 'series', 'Finishing', 'beginning', 'story', 'life', 'beginning', 'up', 'when', 'dinosaurs', 'reign', 'started', 'take', 'off', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'not', 'near-flawless', 'other', 'two', 'Walking', 'Dinosaurs', 'Walking', 'Prehistoric', 'Beasts', 'One', 'major', 'complaints', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'Being', 'only', 'half', 'as', 'long', 'predecessors', 'caused', 'be', 'much', 'too', 'rushed', 'As', 'soon', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'familiar', 'location', ""'re"", 'next', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'reduced', 'many', 'plot', 'elements', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'course', 'predation', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'less', 'focus', 'was', 'subject', 'quite', 'unrealistic', 'overly', 'graphic', 'Also', 'added', 'elements', 'not', 'shown', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'evolution', 'cut-scenes', 'inside', 'animal', 'anatomy', 'Seeing', 'how', 'part', 'trilogy', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'overall', 'structure', 'same', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'case.These', 'complaints', 'aside', 'overall', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'still', 'similar', 'enough', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'predecessors', 'usual', 'locations', 'are', 'perfect', 'prehistoric', 'habitats', 'are', 'partially', 'recreated', 'CGI', 'CGI', 'models', 'are', 'superb', 'look', 'outstandingly', 'real', 'are', 'hardly', 'animatronics', 'program', 'due', 'fact', 'close-ups', 'now', 'look', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'CGI', 'did', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Trilogy', 'Life', 'very', 'interesting', '30', 'min', 'extra', 'covering', 'creation', 'three', 'programs', 'including', 'footage', 'tests', 'Walking', 'Dinosaurs', 'series', 'was', 'even', 'production', 'So', 'not', 'quite', 'perfect', 'still', 'satisfying', 'completion', 'walking', 'trilogy', 'life', 'highly', 'recommended']",Before the Dinosaurs: Walking With Monsters

It's really interesting to see what was on the earth prior to the rise of the dinosaurs--makes you wonder what would have happened if some of those critters had made it & the dinosaurs hadn't developed.  The giant spiders were the big hit with my kids & they also loved the dimetrodons.
