Elevating ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" to a movie for the whole family was a good idea, but the filmmakers apparently were determined to show that they were not going to be sentimental or soft-hearted about any of this.  So, they made the main character a thug.  Instead of transforming gradually throughout the film, he remains a thug and then turns a somersault at the end, betraying his partner and saving the town.  He falls for Lea Thompson.  That's understandable, who wouldn't?  What is incredible is that she is portrayed as falling for him!  Why?  What is the attraction?  He's ugly.  He acts so obviously like a criminal that it's incredible that everyone isn't suspicious.  This particular romance is repulsive.  And as if to make sure to kill the movie, the filmmakers choose a repugnant girl to play the daughter.So, unless you own every other Christmas movie there is, I suggest you buy something else.I give the movie two stars because of Lea.
