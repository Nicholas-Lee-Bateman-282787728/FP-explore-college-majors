989779,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000FGG72O,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","For a film as crisp and `clean' as `Clean', there is an air of dirt that never seems to leave the audience.  This is a good thing, for with a subject as controversial as drugs and parenthood, `Clean' needs to stir around in the grime of the situation.  Thankfully, our director found that much needed balance between the clean and the grime so as not to create something unnaturally saccharine or too unholy in destitution.  `Clean' strikes a beautiful balance and delivers a tragic yet heartwarming tale of life at its most complicated.The film centers around Emily, the girlfriend of musician Lee.  When Lee dies of a heroin overdose Emily finds herself incarcerated and, upon release, at the bottom of the totem pole so-to-speak.  Lee's parents basically blame Emily for their son's death (as if he was incapable of resisting drugs while around her) and so she is practically shunned.  What makes matters worse is that Emily and Lee had a son, and that son is now in the custody of Lee's parents who don't see Emily as a fit parent (she's not).What's a girl to do?As the tagline for this film suggests, when you don't have a choice, you change.As Emily struggles to right herself, her father-in-law Albrecht struggles to understand his emotions towards her and his now deceased son.  It would be easier to just write her off as everlastingly unworthy, but with the loss of a son comes the birth of a daughter and so Albrecht finds himself Emily's only supporter.Some have mentioned that this is not a `new' story, but as I have come to realize there are very few of them floating around here today.  What it boils down to is HOW you tell your story, and this story is told brilliantly.  The script is tightly woven and effortlessly captures the inner struggle, the outer trials and the beauty that comes from triumph WITHOUT ever playing too much to either side.  The acting is such a beautiful thing to witness here, with Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte delivery some of their finest work to date.  Cheung (who masters multiple languages here) portrays Emily's emotional complexity with an earnestness that is hard to forget.  By sidestepping the clich&eacute;d breakdowns and theatrics that often litter a film of this nature, Cheung is allowed to develop a natural progression (and display) of pure emotions.  Nick Nolte (at his most reserved and subtle) delivers a breathtaking glimpse at a man defying his personal loss.  He finds a sort of salvation in Emily, or at least in his personal convictions toward her.  By being her sole-support system, he has given himself reason to outlive his own son.`Clean' is a marvelously crafted and beautifully told story of pain, loss, addiction, love, faith and eventual redemption; and what could be better than that!",5,Cleaning the wound...,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,2762,"['film', 'crisp', 'clean', 'Clean', 'air', 'dirt', 'never', 'leave', 'audience', 'good', 'thing', 'subject', 'as', 'controversial', 'drugs', 'parenthood', 'Clean', 'needs', 'stir', 'around', 'grime', 'situation', 'Thankfully', 'director', 'found', 'much', 'needed', 'balance', 'clean', 'grime', 'so', 'not', 'create', 'something', 'unnaturally', 'saccharine', 'too', 'unholy', 'destitution', 'Clean', 'strikes', 'beautiful', 'balance', 'tragic', 'yet', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'life', 'most', 'complicated.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Emily', 'girlfriend', 'musician', 'Lee', 'When', 'Lee', 'heroin', 'overdose', 'Emily', 'incarcerated', 'release', 'bottom', 'totem', 'pole', 'so-to-speak', 'Lee', 'parents', 'basically', 'blame', 'Emily', 'son', 'death', 'was', 'incapable', 'resisting', 'drugs', 'so', 'practically', 'shunned', 'What', 'matters', 'worse', 'Emily', 'Lee', 'had', 'son', 'son', 'now', 'custody', 'Lee', 'parents', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Emily', 'fit', 'parent', 'not', '.What', 'girl', 'do', 'tagline', 'film', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'change.As', 'Emily', 'struggles', 'right', 'father-in-law', 'Albrecht', 'understand', 'emotions', 'now', 'deceased', 'son', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'just', 'write', 'off', 'everlastingly', 'unworthy', 'loss', 'son', 'birth', 'daughter', 'so', 'Albrecht', 'Emily', 'only', 'supporter.Some', 'have', 'mentioned', 'not', 'new', 'story', 'have', 'come', 'realize', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'floating', 'around', 'here', 'today', 'What', 'down', 'HOW', 'tell', 'story', 'story', 'told', 'brilliantly', 'script', 'tightly', 'woven', 'effortlessly', 'inner', 'struggle', 'outer', 'trials', 'beauty', 'triumph', 'WITHOUT', 'ever', 'playing', 'too', 'much', 'side', 'acting', 'such', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'witness', 'here', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'delivery', 'finest', 'work', 'date', 'Cheung', 'who', 'multiple', 'languages', 'here', 'Emily', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'earnestness', 'hard', 'forget', 'sidestepping', 'clich', 'eacute', 'breakdowns', 'theatrics', 'often', 'film', 'nature', 'Cheung', 'allowed', 'develop', 'natural', 'progression', 'display', 'pure', 'emotions', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'most', 'reserved', 'subtle', 'breathtaking', 'glimpse', 'man', 'defying', 'personal', 'loss', 'sort', 'salvation', 'Emily', 'least', 'personal', 'convictions', 'being', 'sole-support', 'system', 'given', 'reason', 'outlive', 'own', 'son.', 'Clean', 'marvelously', 'crafted', 'beautifully', 'told', 'story', 'pain', 'loss', 'addiction', 'love', 'faith', 'eventual', 'redemption', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'better']",Clean

It is like watching a horror movie that is not scary; a comedy that is not funny.Let me try to understand what this movie is about. It is about a junkie trying to *fight* to get clean. So, she can get her son back. From what I can tell, the junkie doesn't even want her son back at all. It is the grandpa who tries to get rid of the kid. The only person who really wants to keep the kid is the grandma; but grandma is dying. The junkie doesn't even know her son; and the kid doesn't know her mom at all. They are just 2 strangers. I don't see the junkie trying at all.  She keeps on smoking and drinking through out the movie. She cares more about her career than her son. But wait, she doesn't even have a career. No body like her music anyway.At the end, I feel like the story is just something they copy from a 80's movie called ""Over the Top [Blu-ray]"" with Sylvester Stallone. They upside down the characters and change the story a bit. In the other movie, evil grandpa is trying hard to stop the junkie to get back his son. In this movie, good grandpa is trying to get the son back to the bad junkie.But on the bright side, the set and the location are beautiful. The acting is ok.

Things couldn't get much worse, as she bounces from the kindness of one acquaintance to the next.

989783,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000FGG72O,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[3, 3]","Maggie Cheung delivers a knock down stand out performance as Emily Wang in `Clean', a brilliant film that exposes the changes one will make for the sake of a child.  Emily Wang is a drug abusing musician living with her partner Lee (James Johnston).  They had a child together, Jay (James Dennis), who is living with Lee's parents Albrecht (Nick Nolte) and Rosemary Hauser (Martha Henry).  Lee's friends hate Emily and feel she is holding him back from what he could be.  I get the feeling she's the Yoko to his John.After Lee overdoses on the drugs Emily purchased she's faced with a dilemma.  She's facing six-years in prison for possession, but even more so Lee's parents are requesting she stay away from her son, for his sake, and at the moment she agrees.  She's not in any position to care for a child.  After her release she struggles to stay straight, struggles to hold a job and she begins to realize her sole purpose is to be fit to care for her child, so that she can see him again.The transformation Emily undertakes is a beautiful and inspiring thing to watch.  Maggie is completely devoted to her character and she shows so many emotions, from complete selfishness to utter selflessness covered in vast amounts of guilt.  Nick Nolte is also brilliant here.  His sympathy for Emily is heartwarming, and his depression over the loss of his son is shown in his attachment to his grandson Jay.  The final frames of this film will truly touch you, hold you tight and prove to you the power of change and the ability to do so when the ones you love most are affected.",5,For the love of a boy...,1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,1576,"['Maggie', 'Cheung', 'knock', 'down', 'stand', 'out', 'performance', 'Emily', 'Wang', 'Clean', 'brilliant', 'film', 'changes', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'sake', 'child', 'Emily', 'Wang', 'drug', 'abusing', 'musician', 'living', 'partner', 'Lee', 'James', 'Johnston', 'had', 'child', 'together', 'Jay', 'James', 'Dennis', 'who', 'living', 'Lee', 'parents', 'Albrecht', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Rosemary', 'Hauser', 'Martha', 'Henry', 'Lee', 'friends', 'hate', 'Emily', 'feel', 'holding', 'back', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'get', 'feeling', 'Yoko', 'John.After', 'Lee', 'drugs', 'Emily', 'purchased', 'faced', 'dilemma', 'facing', 'six-years', 'prison', 'possession', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Lee', 'parents', 'are', 'requesting', 'stay', 'away', 'son', 'sake', 'moment', 'not', 'position', 'care', 'child', 'release', 'stay', 'straight', 'hold', 'job', 'realize', 'sole', 'purpose', 'be', 'fit', 'care', 'child', 'can', 'see', 'again.The', 'transformation', 'Emily', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'thing', 'watch', 'Maggie', 'completely', 'devoted', 'character', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'complete', 'selfishness', 'utter', 'selflessness', 'covered', 'vast', 'amounts', 'guilt', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'also', 'brilliant', 'here', 'sympathy', 'Emily', 'heartwarming', 'depression', 'loss', 'son', 'shown', 'attachment', 'grandson', 'Jay', 'final', 'frames', 'film', 'will', 'truly', 'touch', 'hold', 'tight', 'prove', 'power', 'change', 'ability', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'ones', 'love', 'most', 'are', 'affected']",Clean
989784,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000FGG72O,Doug Anderson,"[0, 0]","In Irma Vep (1996) Assayas explored the film industry, in Late August/Early September (1998) he explored literary culture, and in Demonlover (2002) he explored the adult entertainment market. In each of these films he explores the connection between an industry and the particular kind of life that it fosters, and so it should come as no surprise that that is exactly what Assayas does again with Clean (2004) which is about the music industry and the kinds of lives that crystallize again and again within that very particular cocoon.In the opening sequence, we get our first glimpse of our main characters, fringe rocker Lee (looking like yet another Joe Strummer wannabe) and Emily (looking every bit the part of the eternally young & cool frizzy-haired rock n roll girlfriend), as they exit their car and enter a small club. As soon as they exit the car we hear the opening chords of the song that is playing inside the club. At first the music is merely background, but as we follow our characters into the club the music becomes the foreground and Assayas shifts our attention away from Lee and Emily and onto the stage where the band Metric performs ""Dead Disco.""  We can tell instantly that Assayas loves music and that he understands the excitement of a live show and we can tell that he wants us to direct our attention beyond its cool veneer and tend to its substance as he stays with the band long enough for us to hear two full verses of the song and to gather that it is about the perpetual recycling of the same ideas/materials/lifestyles/attitudes. When the camera shifts back to our main characters  Lee and Emily look like the very rock n roll cliches the song is talking about and we can gather from the substance of their conversation and the conversation of those around them that they are living one of the oldest rock n roll cliches in the book (heroin addiction). The trick then, for Assayas, is to make a film about a rock n roll cliche (addiction) seem interesting and relevant to our lives. Amazingly, thats just what he does.Very early on, Lee dies of an overdose and everyone (rock press, fans, family and friends) blames Emily because thats what everyone does when a rocker dies of an overdose: they blame the wife or girlfriend. So, in the course of this story, Emily must not only overcome her own addiction but also overcome this stigma, this sense that she has become the very worst kind of rock cliche. Assayas reveals that the road to recovery is fraught with cliches (relapses, dishonesty) but that its also full of interesting insights into what drives musicians to use heroin in the first place (paralyzing insecurity/lack of self-worth). These paralyzing insecurities might themselves be cliches but Assayas shows that each person lives the same cliches differently. With Lee, Emily didn't have to confront her own paralyzing insecurities directly, she could simply escape her own life and disappear into his. But without Lee and his indie legend to hide behind, she has no choice but to confront her own self, however small & seemingly insignificant that self might be, and to find a life and a way to live that is her own. The film thus becomes a record of Emily's quest to find that life (both within the industry and outside of it), and to reunite with her son. In a role that won her a Best Actress Award at Cannes, Maggie Cheung brings Emily's struggle with addiction and self-worth to life. Although it is a story of drug addiction, there are no showstopping scenes, only a series of humilities that teach Emily how to be human again. So this performance is all the more impressive when one considers how much Maggie Cheung does with so little. Cheung does the majority of her acting with just slight changes of expression that signal revelatory internal revisions. And each of these expressive moments are slyly accentuated by Assayas' unusual musical selections (ie Brian Eno's ""Taking Tiger Mountain,"" ""Spider and I,"" ""Jezebel Spirit""...). As subtle as it is, the performance is utterly mesmerizing and unforgettable.As interesting as Emily's story is, Assayas gives considerable attention to a very strong cast of supporting players (something he does in each of his films). Each of these supporting players are interesting in their own right, each are dealing with their own life struggles, and each contribute to Emily's rehabilitation in interesting and sometimes unexpected ways. Most notable among these supporting players is Albrecht Hauser (Nick Nolte) who plays Lee's father and who is raising Lee and Emily's son Jay. It is he who provides Emily with her best example of how to take an accurate measure of oneself and other people, and how to conduct oneself as an unselfish human being who is capable of caring for and connecting to others. In fact, Albrecht is such an interesting character and so good at connecting to other human beings that he almost steals the show. But just as interesting are a number of other supporting players (Beatrice Dalle and Tricky and David Roback among them) whose lives exhibit varying degrees of (romantic and/or professional)adequacy and inadequacy, function and dysfunction. From the supporting players she finds examples of how to be and how not to be. In Demonlover, Assayas examined an industry that seemed designed to amplify our most dysfunctional and dehumanizing urges (and there is a hint of that world in Clean---in the lesbian power struggle between Irene and Sandrine which echoes a similar one in Demonlover), but here he examines a much more functional and humane industry (or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he focuses not on an industry but on select individuals both inside and outside the industry) that seems set on cultivating our higher qualities and impulses. The result is a film that functions as a kind of guide to functional living within a largely dysfunctional world.Irma Vep is the most entertaining of Assayas' films, and Late August/Early September is perhaps the most personal, but this one is probably the most satisfying (plus it features an incredible soundtrack laden with early Brian Eno). Not to be missed.Also not to be missed: Summer Hours (2008) and Carlos (2010).",4,The Story of a Selfish Junkie Who Becomes a Selfless Artist (with lots of Eno),1364947200,"04 3,

This is pretty much a simple story, a little overlong in places to the point that it does not lose pace or interest in the main characters plight. In here we have Maggie Cheung whom plays Emily Wang, a woman in Hamilton, Ontario, with a past of drug addiction and other life-ruining things. Following a raid, her son gets taken away from her and sent to live with his grandfather Albrecht (Nolte) in Vancouver, B.C. So, Maggie decides to restart her life in Paris. While visiting London, Albrecht takes the grandson to Paris to visit her, and then has to face a moral dilemma about whether or not keeping the boy from his mother is a good idea.This is a poignant, and sometimes meandering study of one woman's uphill battle to sobriety, ""Clean"" is one of those movies that sneak up on you with a plot that continually puts the heroine in the flimsy position of not knowing if her own demons will give in to her will to survive or consume her.Maggie Cheung gives a great performance as well as James Dennis, as her son, who probably has the strongest lines with the rejection to his mother. Nick Nolte performs an experienced nice man that believes in forgiveness, but he, actor, seems to be tired. Maggie is on-screen almost all the time except when scenes switch to London to focus on Albrecht, his mother, and Jay (and their anger towards Emily), and her performance is an absolutely moving tour-de-force. The camera clearly loves focusing on her alabaster face, deep eyes, and her low-pitched voice as she moves effortlessly from British English to Cantonese then to French. I didn't even know she spoke French and she speaks it very well.During this film the most touching scene was in the Vincennes Zoo with the boy and Emily who manages a heart-to-heart chat that convinces her son she's not why his dad died -- and might deserve to be his full-time mom. Several brief scenes between Nolte and Cheung does show mutual empathy (""I believe in forgiveness,"" he tells her) by this being said it gives some emotional authenticity to this film.The inconclusive end makes the optimistic viewer like me believes in a final redemption of Emily, but it is open to different interpretations.

989790,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000FGG72O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 6]","""Addict"" films are a dimebag a dozen.  Whether alcohol or drug related, portraying someone in need of a fix can be a great way to showcase your acting chops.  These films tend to fall into two categories, however.  Either the addict leads a desperate life to his/her ultimate demise or there is a revelatory moment where our character decides to reform!  ""Clean"" adheres to these rules, but thwarts them at the same time.  In an intriguingly straightforward and unsympathetic narrative, ""Clean"" presents the story of Emily Wang (played by the great Maggie Cheung).  And while Emily's story may not cover new ground, her character is refreshingly believable and flawed.  Emily is a mess and ""Clean"" never asks us to feel sorry for her.  I, for one, appreciated the character ambiguity that allowed Cheung to flesh out a remarkably complex role.Cheung is a former celebrity hoping to reignite the singing career of her husband while harboring her own entertainment aspirations.  Their tempestuous relationship is plagued by failure in the music business and a dependency on drugs.  Their son is all but forgotten and living with Cheung's in-laws in Canada (led by a restrained Nick Nolte).  When tragedy strikes, Cheung's life is stripped away as she faces prison and the possibility of reform.  Wanting to reestablish a relationship with her son, Cheung attempts to redefine her place and battles to get and stay clean.Many ""addict"" films are fueled by powerful, but often over-the-top, performances.  Cheung's portrayal, however, is remarkably understated and much more realistic due to its lack of big showstopping theatrics.  This is just a real woman, complicated and not particularly likable, who is trying to put her life back on track.  You root for her even as you are aware of her many faults and inadequacies.  Interesting and believable, she seems just as likely to doom herself to failure as she is to make the right choices for her life.  More intelligent than ""smart,"" Cheung is her own worst enemy--and realizing what is necessary to get her son back is often easier than actually taking the appropriate steps to do so.  She and Nolte share some great scenes--filled with both compassion and mistrust in equal measure.  And her interactions with her son have a remarkable candor and dignity.Cheung delivers this astute performance in three languages--Cantonese, French and English--and she is the primary reason to watch ""Clean.""  Taking Best Actress honors at Cannes for this film, she has proven herself to be a dynamic talent. The film is alternately downbeat and hopeful, and it straddles this line adeptly.  The film's quiet resonance will stay with you--there is a haunting, lyrical quality to this picture rather than moments of great revelation.  Thus, the film remains a complex character study that is grounded in reality.  Definitely worth a look!

989791,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000FGG72O,mirasreviews,"[10, 10]","""Clean"" is the second film that director Olivier Assayas wrote with actress Maggie Cheung in mind. When they first collaborated on 1996's ""Irma Vepp"", Cheung was a big Hong Kong movie star whom Assayas didn't know well. Now Cheung is Assayas' ex-wife (their divorce was finalized during filming), and ""Clean"" provides her an opportunity to create a more intimate portrait. The result is one of the most striking performances of 2004, for which Maggie Cheung won a Best Actress Award at the Cannes  Film Festival and a French Cesar nomination in 2005. Cinematographer Eric Gautier was likewise honored with a Cannes win and Cesar nomination. ""Clean"" is a French independent film but has a wonderful international quality -due to its diverse cast and locations- without sacrificing its clear sense of place in Canada and Paris, France. Assayas cast real musicians wherever he could, in keeping with docu-drama and neo-realist traditions of populating movies with authentic supporting players.Lee (James Johnson) is a talented rock musician and songwriter whose career has fizzled in part due to a heroin habit. His junkie wife Emily (Maggie Cheung), an aspiring singer, is argumentative, unrealistic, and generally hated and blamed for Lee's demise by his friends. When Lee dies of an overdose, Emily is busted for heroin possession. When she gets out of prison, Lee's father Albrecht (Nick Nolte) is kind to Emily but asks that she not make any attempt to see her son Jay (James Dennis), whom Albrecht and his wife Rosemary (Martha Henry) have raised since Emily and Lee abandoned the boy on account of their itinerant, wasted lifestyle. In no position to take care of a child anyway, Emily returns to Paris, where she had a career and good contacts in the entertainment industry. Trying hard to stay off the drugs and hold down a job, with uneven success, Emily decides that more than anything she wants to see her son.Emily is not likeable. She is needy and tenacious. She makes bad decisions. She's not sure if she'd rather have a settled, safe life or be a junkie. But she knows she wants to know her son. Somehow her desire to connect with Jay and her struggle, though not always triumphant, to normalize her life reaches out to the audience. Emily makes things difficult for herself and for those around her. She's not someone I'd want to be around in real life. But she is fascinating and empathetic in this film. Nick Nolte deserves praise as well for his craggy, perceptive grandpa, who is intimidated by children but loves his grandson and reaches out to Emily. The odd cast of characters who are Emily's circle in Paris make an interesting tableau. They are vivid enough to keep us interested in a lot of scenes that are superfluous. Vibrant writing by Olivier Assayas keeps ""Clean"" from resembling one of those plodding, overbearing ""portrait of a junkie"" films.

As Emily Wang, she excels at sorrowful emotions and hopelessness balanced by a small light of awareness. She has lost everything after her husband dies and her music career seems to be over, due to misconceptions.Emily progresses through the stages of complete renunciation of cultural norms to a more balanced lifestyle. We watch her soul being born into a new world where she can express her creativity and feel fulfilled as a mother. The story gains a sense of reality through the use of real musicians and especially realistic settings like train stations and even a trip to the zoo.Nick Nolte gives a sensitive and wise performance as the forgiving father-in-law. He seems to not only look after Emily's young son, but he becomes an angel to his daughter-in-law who struggles to re-establish herself in the world.If she can turn her life around or give up her addictive lifestyle, she may get what she wants in the end. Her struggle is a profound and moving example of what you have to do to overcome addictive behaviors. In the end, this movie is as much about creating music as it is about creating your life. This is the hero's journey from a female perspective and I truly enjoyed seeing a woman make difficult and life-changing decisions that led to very positive results and life affirming moments.~The Rebecca Review",5,Reclaiming Life,1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,1746,"['Clean', 'enjoyable', 'multicultural', 'experience', 'three', 'languages', 'variety', 'locations', 'Paris', 'London', 'Canada', 'finally', 'California', 'plenty', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'keep', 'intrigued', 'story', 'hope', 'world', 'where', 'mother', 'life', 'spirals', 'control', 'drug', 'addiction', 'attempts', 'thwart', 'future', 'happiness.Maggie', 'Cheung', 'overwrought', 'performance', 'instability', 'character', 'future', 'Emily', 'Wang', 'sorrowful', 'emotions', 'hopelessness', 'balanced', 'small', 'light', 'awareness', 'lost', 'everything', 'husband', 'dies', 'music', 'career', 'be', 'due', 'misconceptions.Emily', 'progresses', 'stages', 'complete', 'renunciation', 'cultural', 'norms', 'more', 'balanced', 'lifestyle', 'watch', 'soul', 'being', 'born', 'new', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'express', 'creativity', 'feel', 'fulfilled', 'mother', 'story', 'gains', 'sense', 'reality', 'use', 'real', 'musicians', 'especially', 'realistic', 'settings', 'train', 'stations', 'even', 'trip', 'zoo.Nick', 'Nolte', 'sensitive', 'wise', 'performance', 'forgiving', 'father-in-law', 'not', 'only', 'look', 'Emily', 'young', 'son', 'angel', 'daughter-in-law', 'who', 're-establish', 'world.If', 'can', 'turn', 'life', 'give', 'up', 'addictive', 'lifestyle', 'may', 'get', 'what', 'end', 'struggle', 'profound', 'moving', 'example', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'overcome', 'addictive', 'behaviors', 'end', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'creating', 'music', 'creating', 'life', 'hero', 'journey', 'female', 'perspective', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'woman', 'make', 'difficult', 'life-changing', 'decisions', 'led', 'very', 'positive', 'results', 'life', 'affirming', 'moments.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Clean
989793,A13D4E28S63SYF,B000FGG72O,"Ron ""true faith""","[2, 2]","The best thing about ""Clean"" are the brilliant performances from Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte.  There's a vulnerability yet sharp edgeness to Cheung's performance.  Nolte provides a sense of purity in his acting.  What I mean by that is there's nothing overdone in his performance--it's clean and simple.  What I didn't like about ""Clean"" was the fact that it tended to drag at times--especially when the Cheung character relocates to Paris.  What's her conflict?  To clean up her act so she can see her kid?  That's not much to base a film on.  Nor is it anything new.  I think ""Clean"" needed a better story arc.  And the lesbian angle was totally unnecessary.  It didn't add anything to the story.",3,Maggie Cheung is fantastic.,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,699,"['best', 'thing', 'Clean', 'are', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'vulnerability', 'yet', 'sharp', 'edgeness', 'Cheung', 'performance', 'Nolte', 'sense', 'purity', 'acting', 'What', 'mean', 'nothing', 'overdone', 'performance', 'clean', 'simple', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Clean', 'was', 'fact', 'tended', 'drag', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'Cheung', 'character', 'Paris', 'What', 'conflict', 'clean', 'up', 'act', 'can', 'see', 'kid', 'not', 'much', 'base', 'film', 'anything', 'new', 'think', 'Clean', 'needed', 'better', 'story', 'arc', 'lesbian', 'angle', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'story']",Clean
