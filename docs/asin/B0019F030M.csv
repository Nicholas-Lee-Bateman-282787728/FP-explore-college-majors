1163348,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0019F030M,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","Perry Mason Season 3 Volume 1These twelve TV films from 1959 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The original books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is unknown to most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ""ropers"", rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Mason's tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.Often the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films.. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on today's broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes, usually the Preliminary Hearings, often tell about the law. A story adapted from a novel has the year.Spurious Sister 10/3/59; Watery Witness 10/10/59;Garrulous Gambler 10/17/59; Blushing Pearls 10/24/59.Startled Stallion 10/31/59; Paul Drake's Dilemma 11/14/59;Golden Fraud 11/21/59;  Bartered Bikini 12/5/59Artful Dodger 12/12/59;  Lucky Legs (1934) 12/19/59;Violent Village 01/2/60; Frantic Flyer 1/9/60The ""Spurious Sister"" is not from the novel ""Spurious Spinster"".The beginning of ""Watery Witness"" echoes ""Sunset Boulevard"".""Startled Stallion"" echoes part of ""Double Indemnity"".""Violent Village"" explains how rumors can prejudice opinions against the facts in a crime.""Frantic Flyer"" echoes the plot from the ""Fugitive Nurse"" novel.",5,The Original Courtroom Drama,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,2554,"['Perry', 'Mason', 'Season', '3', 'Volume', '1These', 'twelve', 'TV', 'films', '1959', 'are', 'based', 'novels', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'original', 'books', 'are', 'more', 'complete', 'informative', 'tell', 'stories', 'life', 'unknown', 'most', 'people', 'books', 'can', 'tell', 'why', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'films', 'only', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'books', 'tell', 'ropers', 'rough', 'smooth', 'shadows', 'how', 'evade', 'surveillance', 'avoid', 'leaving', 'back', 'trail', 'may', 'question', 'legality', 'ethics', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'tactics', 'most', 'stories', 'were', 'written', 'modern', 'legal', 'rules', '1960s', 'backgrounds', 'tell', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'difficult', 'film', 'scene', 'night', 'easy', 'describe', 'book', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'was', 'founder', 'Court', 'Last', 'Resort', 'sought', 'free', 'many', 'unjustly', 'convicted', 'persons', 'Gardner', 'others', 'sought', 'use', 'scientific', 'means', 'find', 'guilty', 'rather', 'using', 'hunches', 'guesses', 'alone.Often', 'original', 'stories', 'were', 'modified', 'TV', 'theme', 'music', 'typical', 'late', '1950s', 'Note', 'style', 'clothing', 'culture', 'ladies', 'wore', 'white', 'gloves', 'People', 'seldom', 'lock', 'doors', 'prices', 'date', 'films', 'One', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'many', 'automobiles', 'era', 'How', 'many', 'can', 'identify', 'Note', 'slimness', 'people', 'smoking', 'familiarity', 'pistols', 'seeming', 'reality', 'stories', 'due', 'part', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'Watch', 'how', 'actors', 'express', 'emotions', 'facial', 'expressions', 'camera', 'sharpness', 'quality', 'excellent', 'films..', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'today', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'hero', 'stories', 'often', 'use', 'misinterpretation', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'provide', 'dramatic', 'effects', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'usually', 'Preliminary', 'Hearings', 'often', 'tell', 'law', 'story', 'adapted', 'novel', 'year.Spurious', 'Sister', '10/3/59', 'Watery', 'Witness', '10/10/59', 'Garrulous', 'Gambler', '10/17/59', 'Blushing', 'Pearls', '10/24/59.Startled', 'Stallion', '10/31/59', 'Paul', 'Drake', 'Dilemma', '11/14/59', 'Golden', 'Fraud', '11/21/59', 'Bartered', 'Bikini', '12/5/59Artful', 'Dodger', '12/12/59', 'Lucky', 'Legs', '1934', '12/19/59', 'Violent', 'Village', '01/2/60', 'Frantic', 'Flyer', '1/9/60The', 'Spurious', 'Sister', 'not', 'novel', 'Spurious', 'Spinster', '.The', 'beginning', 'Watery', 'Witness', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'Startled', 'Stallion', 'echoes', 'part', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Violent', 'Village', 'how', 'rumors', 'can', 'prejudice', 'opinions', 'facts', 'crime', 'Frantic', 'Flyer', 'plot', 'Fugitive', 'Nurse', 'novel']","Perry Mason: Season 3, Vol. 1"

Raymond was really quite a special guy.this was pretty much the standard that started an awful lot of other crime shows and, although it's from a different era and things have changed alot and we've gotten used to the way it is now, it's still so much fun to watch Perry outwit everyone while barely skirting legality...and looking mighty handsome doing it.  Raymond's sweetness is so prominent in his portrayal of Perry, especially with the elderly, animals and children.i think those of you who wrote 1-star reviews are unfairly skewing the rating of a quality program.  i agree that it's monstrous how paramount have released these DVDs, but to limit your review to their packaging/price is not right.  how will people who've never seen this wonderful show and its wonderful cast know to even want to watch this when all the bad reviews are not about the show?yes, it sucks that paramount are ripping us off, but i read reviews on amazon even when i'm not buying from amazon.  i'm not saying you shouldn't mention what a ripoff it is, that *is* helpful info, but at least let that be a small percentage of your review and talk about what you like about the show!!!",5,stop rating the packaging and price!,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,1804,"['series', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'cast', 'members', 'had', 'such', 'obvious', 'real-life', 'camaraderie', 'made', 'show', 'much', 'better', 'tension', 'Perry', 'Della', 'was', 'so', 'subtle', 'so', 'glaring', 'same', 'time', 'books', 'portray', 'very', 'differently', 'having', 'Perry', 'Della', 'actually', 'smooching', 'car', 'one', 'story', 'i', 'loved', 'how', 'was', 'only', 'left', 'imagination', 'series.if', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Raymond', 'two', 'bios', 'one', 'bit', 'slanted', 'maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'accurate', 'places', 'other', 'places', 'amazingly', 'endearing', 'then', 'should', 'section', 'talking', 'PM', 'will', 'just', 'bring', 'great', 'insights', 'shocks', 'Raymond', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'special', 'guy.this', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'started', 'awful', 'lot', 'other', 'crime', 'shows', 'different', 'era', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'alot', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'way', 'now', 'still', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Perry', 'everyone', 'barely', 'skirting', 'legality', 'looking', 'mighty', 'handsome', 'doing', 'Raymond', 'sweetness', 'so', 'prominent', 'portrayal', 'Perry', 'especially', 'elderly', 'animals', 'children.i', 'think', 'who', 'wrote', '1-star', 'reviews', 'are', 'unfairly', 'skewing', 'rating', 'quality', 'program', 'i', 'agree', 'monstrous', 'how', 'paramount', 'have', 'released', 'DVDs', 'limit', 'review', 'packaging/price', 'not', 'right', 'how', 'will', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'wonderful', 'show', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'know', 'even', 'want', 'watch', 'when', 'bad', 'reviews', 'are', 'not', 'show', 'yes', 'paramount', 'are', 'ripping', 'off', 'i', 'read', 'reviews', 'amazon', 'even', 'when', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying', 'amazon', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', ""n't"", 'mention', 'what', 'ripoff', '*is*', 'helpful', 'info', 'least', 'let', 'be', 'small', 'percentage', 'review', 'talk', 'what', 'like', 'show']","Perry Mason: Season 3, Vol. 1"

I Don't Do Best OfsAnd look at this series, $35.00 and up for 1/2 a season, Most Hour TV shows are going for $50.00 and under.

AKA-Reruns that are shown on TV. The reason they gave for doing this, They bought up the syndicated versions because they were cleaner than the UnCut originals and they didn't want to take the time to clean the UnCut originals.And the actual Run Time is really only 500 Minutes not 620.That's a 120 Minute difference or 2:00 Hrs..Some of the episodes seem confusing because specific parts are gone.Watch Season 1 Episode 1 The Pilot. If it starts with Willie and Kate in the garage sitting at Willies radio, it's Syndicated. The Original Uncut version of this episode started with a Pan of the back yard with Willie and Brian and was close to 26:00 Minutes in length. The DVD episode in only 22:00 Minutes, Maybe. It's missing nearly 2 1/2 to 3 Minutes of footage.Watch the episode called--Try To remember, where ALF hits his head on the side of the bathtub. Wrong, In its Original version, ALF Electrocutes himself in the Bathtub while simulating a Whirling Hot Tub with Kates Electric Mixer. ALF walking into the living room with his Fur Smoking is Priceless. If you watch the part where Lynn says to Willie...Dad, ALF hit his head on the Bathtub and lost his memory, If you read her lipps she actually says, Dad, ALF got Electrocuted and lost his memory.Or something to that effect.I took my ALF Box Set back to Wal-Mart and told them i wanted my $35.00 back. They told me they had a policy about Opened merchandise. So i Blew up and told them the following...Selling this DVD with the word Complete on it was False Advertising and if they didn't give me my money back i was going to go to every News Channel and News Paper. I got my money back within 2 minutes.

You'd be hard pressed to find anyone of any age who doesn't at least recognize the name. Erle Stanley Gardner's books have millions of devoted fans. The television show it spawned was fabulous as entertainment, and today is widely regarded as one of the best shows the medium ever produced. Perry was the attorney you wanted on your side in a jam.Raymond Burr had some good roles in films, but will always be remembered as Perry Mason. It was Gardner himself who picked Burr, even though the studio only agreed to let him test for Perry if he would test for Burger too! Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry.William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger would almost be ready to gloat, Lt. Tragg (Ray Collins) not far behind, when Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer on the witness stand. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable characters, made for terrific viewing.Season three had some great episodes, including a case where Paul was the accused, in a twisty tail of blackmail and murder. Releasing them in half seasons, the first half on volume one, the second on volume two, may indeed be an effective but annoying marketing scheme, but with all the junk out there we're lucky to actually have a few worthy releases such as Perry Mason even available.Season three, beginning in October of 1959 and ending in June of 1960, is as follows: The Case of the Watery Witness--The Case of the Garrulous Gambler--The Case of the Blushing Pearls--The Case of the Startled Stallion--The Case of Paul Drake's Dilemma--The Case of the Golden Fraud--The Case of the Bartered Bikini--  The Case of the Artful Dodger--The Case of the Lucky Legs--The Case of the Violent Village--The Case of the Frantic Flyer--The Case of the Wayward Wife--The Case of the Prudent Prosecutor--The Case of the Gallant Grafter--The Case of the Wary Wildcatter--The Case of the Mythical Monkeys--The Case of the Singing Skirt--The Case of the Bashful Burro--The Case of the Crying Cherub--The Case of the Nimble Nephew--The Case of the Madcap Modiste--The Case of the Slandered Submarine--The Case of the Ominous Outcast--The Case of the Irate Inventor--The Case of the Flighty FatherThis was one of the best dramas ever to hit the air.

1163362,A315K47GRB024C,B0019F030M,Daniel C. Markel,"[16, 19]","Having just watched all 12 episodes of Season Three, Volume 1, and also having purchased and watched the four previous half season Paramount releases, I will say without hesitation that Season Three, Volume 1 is hands down the best set of episodes released so far.  The quality plots, clever twists and courtroom drama are outstanding throughout the vast majority of the shows. I've been a longtime Perry Mason fan and in my opinion this is when the series was at its best.  In the later seasons leading actor Raymond Burr starts to put on a lot of weight and looks tired and in the several last seasons appears openly irritated and burned out, which he later admitted had to do with the decline in the quality of scripts and hectic pace of the weekly productions.  The later shows also loose Lt Tragg (Ray Collins) and is replaced by a lifeless police investigator named Andy.  An interesting event that happened during the '59-60 season was that William Talman who plays Hamilton Burger was arrested in March of 1960 for hosting a completely nude drug party.  CBS decided to fire him on the spot but Burr headed a boycott to reinstate him and CBS quickly capitulated.I'm almost 50 years old and started watching reruns on local TV in the late '70s and early '80s and then tried to build a VHS library from TV broadcasts on the Hallmark Channel about 7-9 years ago and found out to my major disappointment that only about 40% of the episodes were broadcast before they started re-running the same old episodes again.  Then about 5 years ago I found that Columbia House was offering three episodes per month on DVD at $25 a pop which was highway robbery, but I did it anyway (long story short, they stopped after 23 DVDs when Paramount announced they were releasing the entire series and I sold off that Columbia House set on eBay and recovered 85% of my money).  So I'm looking forward to obtaining the entire 9 season collection.I'm very aware of the controversy regarding the price and partial releases.  Who doesn't want them faster, cheaper and in complete seasons?  I agree with a prior reviewer.  I can live with this price (which now is $29.99) if they'd only release them in complete seasons on a faster schedule. In the bigger picture, the set averages to $2.50 per 52 minute episode, which is a bargain compared to paying $10 for an older 80 or 90 minute movie from that same era. The video transfer and restoration of these nearly 50 year old episodes is out of this world, which undoubtedly has a lot to do with the higher cost and slower scheduling.Finally, for those misguided people who out ignorance or stinginess are pondering outsmarting Paramount by buying those complete DVD sets (which are ILLEGAL, low quality, copied from VHS tapes with commercials and many times non-functional, very limited life, bootleg DVDs) offered on various websites, go to Bill Storrer's website (Google: Bill Storrer Mason) and you'll find a long list of complaints pertaining to being ripped off by these pirating miscreants.  I only wish Perry Mason could put consumers who buy this rubbish on the stand and make them publicly defend such repugnant purchases.",5,"Season Three, Volume 1: Perry Mason par excellence!",1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,3161,"['Having', 'just', 'watched', '12', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Three', 'Volume', '1', 'also', 'having', 'purchased', 'watched', 'four', 'previous', 'half', 'season', 'Paramount', 'will', 'say', 'hesitation', 'Season', 'Three', 'Volume', '1', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'set', 'episodes', 'released', 'so', 'far', 'quality', 'plots', 'clever', 'twists', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'are', 'outstanding', 'vast', 'majority', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'been', 'longtime', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'fan', 'opinion', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'best', 'later', 'seasons', 'leading', 'actor', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'put', 'lot', 'weight', 'tired', 'several', 'last', 'seasons', 'openly', 'irritated', 'burned', 'out', 'later', 'admitted', 'had', 'do', 'decline', 'quality', 'scripts', 'hectic', 'pace', 'weekly', 'productions', 'later', 'also', 'loose', 'Lt', 'Tragg', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'replaced', 'lifeless', 'police', 'investigator', 'named', 'Andy', 'interesting', 'event', 'happened', ""'59-60"", 'season', 'was', 'William', 'Talman', 'who', 'Hamilton', 'Burger', 'was', 'arrested', 'March', '1960', 'hosting', 'completely', 'nude', 'drug', 'party', 'CBS', 'decided', 'fire', 'spot', 'Burr', 'headed', 'boycott', 'reinstate', 'CBS', 'quickly', 'capitulated.I', ""'m"", 'almost', '50', 'years', 'old', 'started', 'watching', 'reruns', 'local', 'TV', 'late', ""'70s"", 'early', ""'80s"", 'then', 'tried', 'build', 'VHS', 'library', 'TV', 'broadcasts', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', '7-9', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'major', 'disappointment', 'only', 'about', '40', '%', 'episodes', 'were', 'broadcast', 'started', 're-running', 'same', 'old', 'episodes', 'again', 'Then', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'Columbia', 'House', 'was', 'offering', 'three', 'episodes', 'month', 'DVD', '25', 'pop', 'was', 'highway', 'robbery', 'did', 'anyway', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'stopped', '23', 'DVDs', 'when', 'Paramount', 'announced', 'were', 'releasing', 'entire', 'series', 'sold', 'off', 'Columbia', 'House', 'set', 'eBay', 'recovered', '85', '%', 'money', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'obtaining', 'entire', '9', 'season', 'collection.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'aware', 'controversy', 'regarding', 'price', 'partial', 'releases', 'Who', ""n't"", 'want', 'faster', 'cheaper', 'complete', 'seasons', 'agree', 'prior', 'reviewer', 'can', 'live', 'price', 'now', '29.99', ""'d"", 'only', 'release', 'complete', 'seasons', 'faster', 'schedule', 'bigger', 'picture', 'set', 'averages', '2.50', '52', 'minute', 'episode', 'bargain', 'compared', 'paying', '10', 'older', '80', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'same', 'era', 'video', 'transfer', 'restoration', 'nearly', '50', 'year', 'old', 'episodes', 'world', 'undoubtedly', 'lot', 'do', 'higher', 'cost', 'slower', 'scheduling.Finally', 'misguided', 'people', 'who', 'out', 'ignorance', 'stinginess', 'are', 'pondering', 'outsmarting', 'Paramount', 'buying', 'complete', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'ILLEGAL', 'low', 'quality', 'copied', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'commercials', 'many', 'times', 'non-functional', 'very', 'limited', 'life', 'bootleg', 'DVDs', 'offered', 'various', 'websites', 'go', 'Bill', 'Storrer', 'website', 'Google', 'Bill', 'Storrer', 'Mason', ""'ll"", 'find', 'long', 'list', 'complaints', 'pertaining', 'being', 'ripped', 'off', 'pirating', 'miscreants', 'only', 'wish', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'could', 'put', 'consumers', 'who', 'buy', 'rubbish', 'stand', 'make', 'publicly', 'defend', 'such', 'repugnant', 'purchases']","Perry Mason: Season 3, Vol. 1"

At this point I must interject that I can understand why a lot of fellow PM fans are upset about the pricing and slow release schedule.

Raymond Burr's estate? Hardly. Barbara Hale? Don't make me laugh. Erle Stanley Gardner's estate is certainly getting residuals, but I doubt if anyone originally associated with the program is getting a cent in royalties.This means, that unlike currently made programs, where continuing royalty and syndication rights are arranged for actors, directors, writers and producers to continue long after the programs originally aired---costs which have to be considered in the list pricing of any series release, that---outside of the $1 or so that goes into packaging for each unit, another $1-$2 per unit in production costs, and less than $1 in transport and distribution costs (despite rising gas prices), the rest is pure profit for the studios.This means (IF the $49.99/half-season price tag IS true) that this is one of the biggest rip-offs yet.But I cannot believe this is true.

Even the 5 Complete Seasons Set, is not really discounted much. I purchase them as the price reduces. Season 4..Volume 1 is now 17. I'm glad all the episodes are ""stand alone"".  I buy these DVD's strictly according to the least expensive price.  Season 1 can be seen online for free, at CBS.com.  Yes, there are a few rather loud commercial breaks. The volumes dramatically pumps up when the commericals air, but it's free.I adore Perry Mason. My father looks so much like him, but beyond that; this is classic TV of bygone years with often quirky characters, and those fabulous cars. Also, watching allows for revisiting the general politeness and consideration of people's behavior of years past...excluding the villians, of course.
