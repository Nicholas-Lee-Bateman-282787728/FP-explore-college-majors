CS beniffited from the fullness of a full orchestra and those wondreful musicians in AYS!!! After watching this concert, I found a renewed love of CS. And even if you do not have much history with Collective Soul, you WILL appreciate the energy and enthusiasm of these artists!As well as the amazing job they do; Writing, singing and preforming. It is just too bad that Collective Soul can't tour with a full 100+ orchestra, so that we can all appreciate their dynamics!! Instead of just on DVD...Update;Now that I have the DVD, I love this concert even more! About two or three songs that are on this DVD were not originally aired on FreeView.

961916,A1SOOPZE38LG7M,B000CRSDM8,"December Girl ""*DecemberGirl*""","[11, 12]","I was in the front row of this concert.  This DVD captures the sound quality literally AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET without actually being there.  The TV runs don't do this justice - you HAVE to get the DVD to experience the whole thing appropriately!  Direct TV and VH1 have each run partials of the concert.  VH1 cut out half of it, to their discredit -- and of course the half they cut out was, in my opinion, the best orchestral arrangments of the whole show.My picks for the show?  My personal favorite was CROWN.  If you are familiar with Collective Soul's CD arrangement, this is so far above and beyond better - and I loved the CD cut.  You can't imagine how moving this tribute to Ed's father is, with orchestra.  In my opinion, Ed's best vocal of the concert.  It's the most poignant moment of the show - the next, being YOUTH, with just Ed (vocal and guitar) and a cello.TIED with first, is the orchestral arrangement of PRETTY DONNA.  (I cried during this at the show - although I hate to admit that  ;)  Simply breathtaking.Second pick for orchestral arrangement was NEEDS.  This is my all-time 2nd favorite Collective Soul song and favorite video (check it out on LaunchCast!).  I don't feel this was Ed's best vocal performance, but the arrangement was beyond excellent and everything I expected it would be (and I had HIGH expectations, mind you).Third pick was THE WORLD I KNOW.  SUPERB arrangement and superbly done by all involved.Of course, you gotta love SHINE.  There's just no two ways about it.This concert takes you through most of the ""big hits"" you'll recognize as Collective Soul (even if you don't know who did the songs originally or can't remember) and you'll hear them like you never have before -- and you'll hear new songs from their CD, Youth (I also reviewed this - check out my review).These kids in the Atlanta Symphony Youth ORchestra were amazing.OH that's another thing - you've GOT to watch the ""BEHIND THE SCENES"".  In my opinion that's the best part.  Will (bass player) is EXCELLENT and you can tell all the guys are really having a great time and it's a great moment in their history.  They are excellent with the kids and the kids are really excited.  Every one of these kids is a master of their instrument.Granted you will find some arrangements that orchestra doesn't really mesh with -- HEAVY (in my opinion, but it was cool to see how they pulled it off) being one -- but even on that one, the stage show was enough to keep you on your toes.ALL IN ALL, I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ENOUGH.  It's a pity they did not have this out BEFORE Christmas.  BUY THE companion CD also.I am a professional musician and this is hands down the BEST concert I have had the pleasure of experiencing.  I have seen rock concerts, I have seen symphonies - now I have seen both at once, and this is the best thing I have seen in YEARS.

961919,A2MUZOG2NNUBUB,B000CRSDM8,"I. J. Sloan ""thegreyfox""","[0, 1]","It is interesting that there is only one review lower than 5 stars for this DVD. I must admit my reaction on first seeing it was a definite 5 stars, and still is.Visuals and sound are excellent; editing is interesting and these days, more importantly, ""not annoying!""; the orchestra adds a richness and an element of fun to the whole proceedings to the point of bringing a tear to your eye; song selection is great; Ed Rolands singing is top class, and the band seem tight and on form ... how could it NOT be 5 stars?Well, in defence of a lower than 5 star rating, I do tend to agree that an orchestral backing DOES smooth and fill out the performance to the point where the group itself either cannot play, or the listener cannot hear all the nuances of their own performance. It is not simply an issue with this recording, but most concerts with an orchestral backing. ""Score"" by dream Theater is another recent example.I don't know if you have ""polyfilla"" in the USA .... to fill in cracks in walls around the house ?  anyway, you know the sort of thing I mean. ..... to me, an orchestra is musical ""polyfilla"", and the question is, do you like a very full, nice and smooth, very polished performance, or one a little rougher around the edges, the way (perhaps) rock music should be ?This DVD is most definitely the former, an the best example of this is in ""Heavy""... my favourite CS track ... the orchestra took the sharp edge off this track and towards the end, the orchestral embellishments were, IMO, more of an (out of time?) distraction than anything else.Apart from that little gripe, I am still very happy with this DVD, but I CAN see how others might want to see the band stretching out a little more. Living in the UK and not getting to see them at all UNTIL this DVD release, I would definitely like to add to this excellent DVD with the option to see them in the ""raw"".",5,a lot of fun !,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,1885,"['interesting', 'only', 'one', 'review', 'lower', '5', 'stars', 'DVD', 'must', 'admit', 'reaction', 'first', 'seeing', 'was', 'definite', '5', 'stars', 'still', 'is.Visuals', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'editing', 'interesting', 'days', 'more', 'importantly', 'not', 'annoying', 'orchestra', 'richness', 'element', 'fun', 'whole', 'proceedings', 'point', 'bringing', 'tear', 'eye', 'song', 'selection', 'great', 'Ed', 'Rolands', 'singing', 'top', 'class', 'band', 'seem', 'tight', 'form', 'how', 'could', 'NOT', 'be', '5', 'stars', 'Well', 'defence', 'lower', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'do', 'tend', 'agree', 'orchestral', 'backing', 'DOES', 'smooth', 'fill', 'out', 'performance', 'point', 'where', 'group', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'listener', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'nuances', 'own', 'performance', 'not', 'simply', 'issue', 'recording', 'most', 'concerts', 'orchestral', 'backing', 'Score', 'dream', 'Theater', 'recent', 'example.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'polyfilla', 'USA', 'fill', 'cracks', 'walls', 'house', 'anyway', 'know', 'sort', 'thing', 'mean', '..', 'orchestra', 'musical', 'polyfilla', 'question', 'do', 'very', 'full', 'nice', 'smooth', 'very', 'polished', 'performance', 'one', 'little', 'rougher', 'edges', 'way', 'perhaps', 'rock', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'DVD', 'most', 'definitely', 'former', 'best', 'example', 'Heavy', 'favourite', 'CS', 'track', 'orchestra', 'took', 'sharp', 'edge', 'track', 'end', 'orchestral', 'embellishments', 'were', 'IMO', 'more', 'time', 'distraction', 'anything', 'else.Apart', 'little', 'gripe', 'am', 'still', 'very', 'happy', 'DVD', 'CAN', 'see', 'how', 'others', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'band', 'stretching', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'Living', 'UK', 'not', 'getting', 'see', 'UNTIL', 'DVD', 'release', 'would', 'definitely', 'add', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'option', 'see', 'raw']",N/A

961921,A1LJZWBVCB44RO,B000CRSDM8,"K. Sullivan ""No accounting for taste...""","[25, 26]","A little context...  I have been a fan of Collective Soul since I first heard Shine years ago.  At one point I had all of their CD's.  I enjoyed all their radio hits and didn't qualify any of their stuff as throw away.  Their instrumentation is frequently lush and beautiful.  Their lyrics are often touching and meaningful.  There is certainly a depth to most of their music that other bands lack.  They also have a great rock vibe.  That being said, however, I never played their CD's a lot.  When I heard them, I enjoyed them, but they never ruled my stereo.  Their greatest hits compilation was obviously enjoyable, but I was let down because their earlier stuff was not remastered to the quality of their newer stuff.  I had very limited exposure to the band performing live.  I was impressed with their Higher Places recording for MTV and I had only seen them perform live one other time.  I believe it was on Letterman or some other television program.  I thought Ed Roland (lead vocalist) was a bit awkward in his movement but the performance was tight.With that background, I was excited to see they had released a live DVD but remained hesitant to purchase it because I was nervous about what I would see.  I finally decided to take the plunge and I am extremely pleased I did.The band does a phenomenal job.  The lead and backing vocals are extremely tight.  Musically the band is in top form.  The Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra is just wonderful.  What a talented group of students!  There is probably no rock band that is better suited to perform with an orchestra.  Collective Soul has such a lush, symphonic sound anyway.  The songs are fully realized in this setting.  It is just a powerful and beautiful experience.  Seeing Ed display emotion in dedicating ""Crown"" to his late father or in experiencing his own creations being transformed by the orchestra was very special.  The songs are so beautiful when played sparingly; they are almost heavenly when delivered in this manner.  It is like you are hearing them the way they were meant to be experienced.  The band and the orchestra truly mesh (or ""gel"" if you will) brilliantly.  Seeing the orchestra jump up and down and clap along in ""Better Now"" was a lot of fun.If there is anything to comment negatively on, it is very little.  I was a bit shocked by a cheesy graphic where various still frames roll out to fill the screen.  It is like the only graphic during the entire DVD concert performance.  It is a bit hokey and out of place.  The concert hall itself is a bit odd.  The venue's stage seems almost as large as the ""seating"".  To accommodate an orchestra it naturally had to be this way, but it still takes some getting used to. The lighting is also a bit strange for a concert, but given their requirements, I think they did a good job.  The crowd also did not seem like the most exuberant.  Thankfully the editing did not feature much of the audience.  I still find Ed's stage presence a bit awkward, but it has a real endearing quality as well.  Only so much can be done with a mic stand, but he seems to be having fun with it!The bottom line, I fell in love with the band all over again.  This is a tremendous concert DVD.  I am now considering purchasing the corresponding CD.  It features most of their greatest hits delivered in a truly special way and mastered for the best sound.  It will have that advantage over their greatest hits CD, anyway.  Collective Soul is truly a great live rock band.",5,Positively phenomenal production,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,3487,"['little', 'context', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Collective', 'Soul', 'first', 'heard', 'Shine', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'point', 'had', 'CD', 'enjoyed', 'radio', 'hits', 'did', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'stuff', 'throw', 'away', 'instrumentation', 'frequently', 'lush', 'beautiful', 'lyrics', 'are', 'often', 'touching', 'meaningful', 'certainly', 'depth', 'most', 'music', 'other', 'bands', 'lack', 'also', 'have', 'great', 'rock', 'vibe', 'being', 'said', 'however', 'never', 'played', 'CD', 'lot', 'When', 'heard', 'enjoyed', 'never', 'ruled', 'stereo', 'greatest', 'hits', 'compilation', 'was', 'obviously', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'because', 'earlier', 'stuff', 'was', 'not', 'remastered', 'quality', 'newer', 'stuff', 'had', 'very', 'limited', 'exposure', 'band', 'performing', 'live', 'was', 'impressed', 'Higher', 'Places', 'recording', 'MTV', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'perform', 'live', 'one', 'other', 'time', 'believe', 'was', 'Letterman', 'other', 'television', 'program', 'thought', 'Ed', 'Roland', 'lead', 'vocalist', 'was', 'bit', 'awkward', 'movement', 'performance', 'was', 'tight.With', 'background', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'had', 'released', 'live', 'DVD', 'remained', 'hesitant', 'purchase', 'was', 'nervous', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'finally', 'decided', 'take', 'plunge', 'am', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'did.The', 'band', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'lead', 'backing', 'vocals', 'are', 'extremely', 'tight', 'Musically', 'band', 'top', 'form', 'Atlanta', 'Symphony', 'Youth', 'Orchestra', 'just', 'wonderful', 'What', 'talented', 'group', 'students', 'probably', 'rock', 'band', 'better', 'suited', 'perform', 'orchestra', 'Collective', 'Soul', 'lush', 'symphonic', 'sound', 'anyway', 'songs', 'are', 'fully', 'realized', 'setting', 'just', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'experience', 'Seeing', 'Ed', 'display', 'emotion', 'dedicating', 'Crown', 'late', 'father', 'experiencing', 'own', 'creations', 'being', 'transformed', 'orchestra', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'songs', 'are', 'so', 'beautiful', 'when', 'played', 'sparingly', 'are', 'almost', 'heavenly', 'when', 'delivered', 'manner', 'are', 'hearing', 'way', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'experienced', 'band', 'orchestra', 'truly', 'mesh', 'gel', 'will', 'brilliantly', 'Seeing', 'orchestra', 'jump', 'up', 'down', 'clap', 'along', 'Better', 'Now', 'was', 'lot', 'fun.If', 'anything', 'comment', 'negatively', 'very', 'little', 'was', 'bit', 'shocked', 'cheesy', 'graphic', 'where', 'various', 'still', 'roll', 'out', 'fill', 'screen', 'only', 'graphic', 'entire', 'DVD', 'concert', 'performance', 'bit', 'hokey', 'place', 'concert', 'hall', 'bit', 'odd', 'venue', 'stage', 'almost', 'as', 'large', 'seating', 'accommodate', 'orchestra', 'naturally', 'had', 'be', 'way', 'still', 'getting', 'used', 'lighting', 'also', 'bit', 'strange', 'concert', 'given', 'requirements', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'crowd', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'most', 'exuberant', 'Thankfully', 'editing', 'did', 'not', 'feature', 'much', 'audience', 'still', 'find', 'Ed', 'stage', 'presence', 'bit', 'awkward', 'real', 'endearing', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'Only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'mic', 'stand', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'bottom', 'line', 'fell', 'love', 'band', 'over', 'again', 'tremendous', 'concert', 'DVD', 'am', 'now', 'considering', 'purchasing', 'corresponding', 'CD', 'most', 'greatest', 'hits', 'delivered', 'truly', 'special', 'way', 'mastered', 'best', 'sound', 'will', 'have', 'advantage', 'greatest', 'hits', 'CD', 'anyway', 'Collective', 'Soul', 'truly', 'great', 'live', 'rock', 'band']",N/A
961922,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B000CRSDM8,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[0, 0]","I am completely new to Collective Soul. I had been trying various 'Music in High Places' and their singing in Morocco stood out. I risked the concert and found it just incredibly good. It was high energy, well shot, great sound, great lighting and backed by an excellent youth orchestra (as good as an adult orchestra). These guys are just nice to hang out with in this format and I like that in a concert. Many bands sound good but visually arent friendly or entertaining. These guys are, their lead singer is charasmatic and they connect with the audience really well. The guitar work is brilliant too. The only minor criticism is that the vocals could get a bit drowned out by the wall of sound but with the overall great music and sound it is a minor quibble.Now if you are a casual grazer like I am this rock band are worth the risk.

I now own every one of their albums and I love them all. This one is no exception! I love how they included the orchestra into their songs, it gave them such depth and it was great to hear them in a new way. When you listen to the cd it feels like your there, they did a great job of getting the energy of that night across the album to the listener. For newcomers to CS I recommend this album along with Home and Seven Year Itch, this will give you a great cross section of the past, present, and future of their sound. For die-hards like myself, this is a must for any CS collection!

961925,AF65C8QK9NNXP,B000CRSDM8,Michael,"[34, 35]",This DVD is a great production. The sound is amazing and the visuals are nicely done. It's also nice to have a concert DVD where the director hasn't gone crazy with rapid-fire camera changes and effects. Collective Soul are a great band that have a big catalogue of songs. This DVD showcases all their hits accompanied by an orchestra. The orchestra fits in very nicely with the band without overpowering any of the tunes so that what you get is a real Collective Soul concert plus strings.
