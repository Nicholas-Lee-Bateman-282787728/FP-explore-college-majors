1060556,ASBH6WZRY79PN,B000NU2924,"C. B. Miller ""C B Miller""","[3, 5]","1962 U.S. film (later re-released as ""Women of Nazi Germany""). It starred Richard Basehart as Hitler. The film depicts Hitler through the years, beginning with the 1923 ""Beer Hall Putsch"" in Munich. It focuses mainly on his private life, in particular, his relationships with niece Geli and longtime mistress (later in April 1945, his wife for less than 2 days), Eva Braun. Simply, a low budget, fictionalized account with many inaccuracies.It is still not as bad as the 1973 British TV production, ""The Death of Adolf Hitler"", which I would rate the worst. Thereafter, the presentations of Hitler got better in a factual sense. Next in line, after the subject film, from worst to best would be: ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days"", which is almost a parody of the facts, as well. Then would come the HBO production ""The Bunker"", with Sir Anthony Hopkins. The best and most accurate film to date on the subject is the German feature film, ""Downfall"" (A/K/A Der Untergang).

1060557,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000NU2924,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 1]","HITLER (a/k/a ""Women of Nazi Germany"", U.S. release, 1962) with Richard Basehart as the evil dictator. Having reviewedThe Misfits, dating from the year before, this is almost a relief. Problem is, this thing is a set-stage piece; Basehart deserved a true, full-blown film budget for his brilliant, weird portrayal of Hitler. And bear in mind that this wasn't something people were jumping to play. It might have been a career-killing move.Hence the ""Freudian"" take on Hitler attempting to make the moves on his niece (Marie Emo). Yes, Hitler had a niece (his sister's daughter) and he was very fond of her. Good enough, lights, camera, action, print it!! In fact, Basehart's greasy evil villainy aside, this film has nothing of note, nothing of interest to a WWII or history buff. It shows a silly portrayal of a man too obsessed with his niece to be of much use. If Hitler had really been this way, the world would have been saved.I recommend it for the creep factor and some of the things about Hitler they accidentally got right. Mainly I like it because I can understand it, why they did this at the time they did. And certainly one can see exactly why the great Basehart was chosen to do it. After all, too, this was based on very accurate facts: Hitler did have a sister very close to him. His nephew, Patrick, would later go first to England then later to America to wage a campaign against his uncle. And as I have said, he was extremely fond of his niece.It is no surprise to see this is not out on DVD - at least not here. With the endless Hitler-themed films proliferating steadily since this weird offering, I really would not waste any time on this. The two stars I gave it are strictly for Richard Basehart's nearly unmatched, brilliant performance. He even got the tone of Hitler's voice precisely.",2,HEIL BASEHART,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,1813,"['HITLER', 'Women', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'U.S.', 'release', '1962', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'evil', 'dictator', 'Having', 'reviewedThe', 'Misfits', 'dating', 'year', 'before', 'almost', 'relief', 'Problem', 'thing', 'set-stage', 'piece', 'Basehart', 'deserved', 'true', 'full-blown', 'film', 'budget', 'brilliant', 'weird', 'portrayal', 'Hitler', 'bear', 'mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'people', 'were', 'jumping', 'play', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'career-killing', 'move.Hence', 'Freudian', 'take', 'Hitler', 'attempting', 'make', 'moves', 'niece', 'Marie', 'Emo', 'Yes', 'Hitler', 'had', 'niece', 'sister', 'daughter', 'was', 'very', 'fond', 'Good', 'enough', 'lights', 'camera', 'action', 'print', 'fact', 'Basehart', 'greasy', 'evil', 'villainy', 'aside', 'film', 'nothing', 'note', 'nothing', 'interest', 'WWII', 'history', 'buff', 'silly', 'portrayal', 'man', 'too', 'obsessed', 'niece', 'be', 'much', 'use', 'Hitler', 'had', 'really', 'been', 'way', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'saved.I', 'recommend', 'creep', 'factor', 'things', 'Hitler', 'accidentally', 'got', 'right', 'Mainly', 'like', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'did', 'time', 'did', 'certainly', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'exactly', 'why', 'great', 'Basehart', 'was', 'chosen', 'do', 'too', 'was', 'based', 'very', 'accurate', 'facts', 'Hitler', 'did', 'have', 'sister', 'very', 'close', 'nephew', 'Patrick', 'would', 'later', 'go', 'first', 'England', 'then', 'later', 'America', 'wage', 'campaign', 'uncle', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'extremely', 'fond', 'niece.It', 'surprise', 'see', 'not', 'out', 'DVD', 'least', 'not', 'here', 'endless', 'Hitler-themed', 'films', 'proliferating', 'steadily', 'weird', 'offering', 'really', 'would', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'two', 'stars', 'gave', 'are', 'strictly', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'nearly', 'unmatched', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'even', 'got', 'tone', 'Hitler', 'voice', 'precisely']",N/A
1060558,A38N5WAMPE808U,B000NU2924,Hollywood Hack,"[2, 4]","Richard Basehart gives a sharp, searing portrayal of Hitler--who rose to power by executing all who disagreed with him in a paranoid fear of treason, then in WWII executed all his officers who suggested he negotiate a treaty when all was lost, or because he imagined they were part of a conspiracy to murder him. His two mistresses are also featured as victims of his savage rage over being impotent or his feeling they were unequal to his mother who died when he was very young. Could break a few records for screen shootings, bombings, and hangings, so not for the faint of heart.
