562650,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,B0000509C5,"A. Calabrese ""othernj""","[6, 9]","Maxium Overdrive written and directed by Stephen King gets better every time I watch it.  I guess I've viewed this film about a half dozen times.  It is a bit campy, but the acting, by the professional actors, for the most part is good.  King has a way of directing that allows us to see the humorous errors of our ways.  Pat Hingle as the over confident red neck owner of the Dixie Truck Stop is wonderful.  Estevez as the punked out underpaid dish washer fits the bill.  And, you get the annoying whine of the voice of Liza Simpson, Yeardly Smith, thrown in.  When the self propelled endless convoys of tractor trailers zones in on the Dixie Truck stop to feed their insatiable appetite for more fuel one cannot help but make the connection to our own gas guzzling addiction in 2005.  This film is about 20 years old, but is still fresh.  AC/DC did all of the soundtrack, and while I am not a fan of theirs, their music adds great mood to this Sci-fi classic.  If there is a down side to the movie it is that there seems to be a loss of continuity in the story line.  I think in the beginning of the movie it is a comet that turns the night sky green and sets the machines against the humans, but at the end of the movie their is a post script saying it was a UFO.  Well that is little price to pay for an otherwise great flick in the tradition of cheesy 1950's horror movies.

He had belly-ached for years about the low quality of the film versions of his horror stories, claiming that he could do it better himself. Well, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE (based on S.K.'s excellent short story ""TRUCKS"") is a serious monument to ineptitude! Don't get me wrong, I love Steve's books and have spent many sleepless nights reading them. However, King directs movies with all the finess of a gorilla tossing a salad! Scenes of ""horror"" are hilarious, and humorous lines sink like lead life-jackets. I think the main problem lies in the fact that the short story is about 10 pages long, leaving Steve with WAY too much time to fill. Emilio Estevez and Pat Hingle lumber through their roles like logs on the way to the mill. Estevez as an action hero is like Arny Schwarzenegger as King Lear! The trucks and other machines that come to life are utterly un-terrifying (putting a plastic 'green goblin' face on the grill of the main truck was no help, as it just wobbled along looking stupid).

I will tell you that when I first watched this movie, back in the 80s as a child, it scared me. Not the ""monster in the closet"" or ""ghost in the attic"" or even the ""zombies outside my window"" scare, it was a whole new tingly kind the ""I am afraid to go on the highway or plug anything in"" scare. What Jaws did for the ocean, Maximum Overdrive did for outlets and I-75.

The AC/DC soundtrack is awesome, and fits the whole killer machine storyline, the sounds of the trucks, and airplanes, and ice cream trucks and lawnmowers and electric knives add their own musical horror throughout.  I also have a soft spot for Emilio Estevez, he has such a presence on screen, his laughter is infectious, and him being in a bloodstained white t-shirt was enough for me to form a lifelong crush on him that still resonates to this day, sick I know but he is just hot.

A rogue comet is blamed at first, then a ""large UFO,"" for machines turning on their owners ""we made you!""  A bit of a rogue himself, director/screenwriter King confused himself with Hitchcock and did a walk-on (following by a rude remark, severing forever any connection with the great director).This movie staggers clumsily from slapstick (involving a drawbridge) to the horrific (a boy and a steamroller).  Too puerile to be consider macabre humor, it nevertheless provides enough irrationality to be constantly entertaining (not that I'd admit to that in public).  Take that variation on the old water hose gag only with a nozzle used for pumping gas, not original but it works.  As for the characters, each and every one of them is an aching clich&eacute; (from the redneck yahoo Bubba Hendershot, played by Pat Hingle, to the underplayed ""boy"" hero Emilio Estevez, nominated for a worst actor Razzie Award).  There's also an irritating screamer (Yeardley Smith) and yes, the mandatory slur against Christians, a two-faced Bible salesman (Christopher Murney).

I know a lot of people hate it and think it is the worst King adapted film but I still enjoy it. I don&#8217;t know if it is my love for King, Estevez, or more likely my love for the Green Goblin but I do like this flick. Of course I recognize its flaws and will never put it in a top ten list or anything. This was the first and only time King has directed a film which I think is a mistake because I feel he can make a great film. This was also the film in which DP Armando Nannuzzi lost one of his eyes.On June 19 1987 a comet comes in contact with Earth or at least its trail which causes machines to operate on their own. This of course leads them to kill their oppressive human owners and launch a mechanical revolution. The biggest threat are the trucks that have taken over a gas station trapping several people inside. As time goes by the humans have to figure a way out of the situation before the trucks come for them and stop waiting.Now you would think that nobody could adapt and then direct a Stephen King story better than Stephen King himself. As it turns out it is really a mixed bag of sorts. Sure over all the film is not a classic but King does show that he knows how to direct action as we get plenty of it here. This is far from a horror flick but it is a good action/Sci-Fi movie on the B level. Trucks, guns, and explosions make for an entertaining time when the brain is shut off. Of course the acting could have been better but I thought for the type of film it is they were good.I honestly would love to see this rereleased with a commentary and such added, maybe some behind the scenes stuff. This is the film that lead to the DP of the film loosing an eye and then suing King. Any way over all I do enjoy this flick and find it fun.

He warned me that the movie is pretty cheesy, but in a good way.  Sometimes I'm into cheesy films, but the premise of this film just seemed too goofy, so I was prepared for quite a flop.  Much to my surprise I ended up rather enjoying this movie.Basically a cosmic anomaly interferes with Earth and all the machines start coming to life, including vehicles and so forth, and start attacking people.  The story is set in a very small town and despite the fact this problem is happening everywhere, this is about how those specific people tried to survive the horror.  It's kind of a ridiculous concept, but it's written by Stephen King and usually he has a pretty creative take on such things.  I'm not sure other writers would have been able to make this concept interesting, but King sure does, he really makes you wonder what's going to happen and there's plenty of dark humor to be had... in a sick and twisted way of course.  I may not be much of an avid King reader, but I do enjoy the movies that are taken from his library.This is sort of an a-typical mid-80's film, so those in my age group will probably know what it means.  It means the cinematography isn't going to hugely compete with newer films, which will always have newer and better technology.  The acting is a little over acted in many scenes, which seems to be another common thread for under produced films in the 1980's.  Regardless of budget, I thought they put together a pretty interesting story and made it fun to watch overall.  It's got a lot of bad qualities which make it funny, but the way it plays out, its kind of obvious that it's intentional, so can't knock them for that!  I mean, it's kind of obvious this is supposed to have a degree of dark humor and fun to it when you see the soundtrack is done by AC/DC.Overall this was definitely worth the watch for me.  It's just a fun movie, regardless of how stupid some of the scenarios are.  It's not overly gory and it focuses more on the people struggling to survive and how they plan their escape.  So it does have a bit of that campy horror quality to it.

I saw this movie in the TV guide coming on Halloween weekend and it's characterized as ""horror""...is that what they call it?  I'm sorry, I just don't see it.  Still, this was a pretty good idea for a book and movie, notwithstanding its obvious limitations.  That said, the movie does tend to get a little boring in spots, especially toward the end...this is because of the limitations involved with such an idea.  In other words, how much can you do with killer 18 wheel trucks once people get inside a gas station?The story behind ""Maximum Overdrive"" is basically about a comet that comes near the Earth and the presence and influence of this comet makes all of the machines go crazy from Coke machines to 18 wheeler Mack trucks.  So, what you get in ""Maximum Overdrive"" is a Man v. Machine duel.  From a Sci-Fi and comedy standpoint, the movie is mildly entertaining, especially if there is nothing else on.  Still, this is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination and definitely not horror.  Don't get me wrong, I would be scared of a Mack truck coming after me too, but does the movie belong in the horror movie genre or sci-fi genre?The acting is average in this movie, but Emilio Estevez does a good job in his role as the really intelligent ner do well who washes dishes at a truck stop.  The script/storyline is quite imaginitive and despite being farfetched, the plot works and the audience can understand it to be plausible in a Sci-Fi kind of way.All and all, a pretty good movie, but I thought the movie declined towards the end when the survivors attempt to escape the trucks.

No.  This movie was based on the short story ""Trucks"" from his collection ""Night Shift"".  Actually, ""Trucks"" proceeded ""Christine"" in writing, and ""Christine"" was actually better as a movie.This movie, as a lot of Steven King's story, has a scientific explanation for the horror.  In this case, the tail of a comet brought machines to life.  Yet they had an intelligence that is unexplained.  Also unexplained is why it didn't effect the cars of some of the people who ended up at the truck stop.One person criticized the acting, but I thought the acting was decent.  The problem was the scripting; it came across like an amateur screenwriter, who could learn from better writers like the popular horror writer Stephen King  . . . Wait!  King is that amateur screenwriter!  One thing I didn't like was a boy asked about his father.  The lead characters were going to lie to him, and the truck stop owner coldly told him the truth.  The lead characters acted like the problem was telling the truth, not the manner of telling that truth.Included was an early cameo of King, but it came across in his first scene that he was looking behind him to make sure the camera was working; it did not seem natural.The item I really despised was a religious hypocrite in the movie.  By that point, I was beginning to see Christian hypocrites were common in his stories.  The one here corresponded with a character in the short story, but the religious aspect of the short story character was absent.

For about 20 minutes this movie promises to be cool and funny thru-out but quickly becomes boring and stupid. The characters just do not use simple logic and it is way hard to side with them. I really did want the trucks to run them over.-Beware, there may be some spoilers here.-Everyone at the truck stop knows that Mr. Hendershot has a truckload of weapons and rocket launchers in the basement. So why don't they just use them against the trucks? Duh?The dialogue [is bad] too. There is not one memorable line in the entire movie. And the acting is sporadically bad. The girl who becomes Emilio Estevez's girlfriend is very beautiful but she cannot act her way out of a linen closet. The pointless AC/DC soundtrack is totally worthless and contributes ZERO to the film.For Spiderman fans (like me) there is a bonus tho, as there is a huge face of the Green Goblin on the toy truck. But that's still no reason to watch this farce. The reason these trucks are coming to life is because the earth is caught in the tail of a comet (which we never see) and all machines are rebelling against mankind. We don't see many other machines other than the trucks but it turns out that it was all just a plot by aliens to sweep us off the planet. This is unseen also, we are simply told this from words on the screen at the end of the movie.

562716,A1XXBVRRNGBG5Y,B0000509C5,kendall lopere,"[3, 5]","Anyone caught in the Blackout of 2003 must surely have thought of this movie.  When the T.V. stopped working, the familiar drone of the fridge was eerily gone and trucks kept rumbling by on the unlit streets... all that was missing was the psychotic roar of a lawnmower springing to life and chasing you down the street!I have two confessions to make.1) I hate almost all Stephen King adaptions except two.2) The two I like are Carrie and Maximum Overdrive.Maximum Overdrive is a great film (hear me out before clicking on the &quot;Unhelpful review&quot; button!).First of all, it is set in a situation that we can all relate to, everyday life in an urban environment, compare this with an empty hotel at the top of a mountain for example.It preys on one of our biggest 21st Century fears, that we are no longer in control of our environment.  Humankind has become so detached from the everyday rigours of surviving that our ancestors went through that we have no idea what we would do if our civilization broke down. No electricity, no fridge, no food, no machines, no information, no phones.  Maximum Overdrive brings these fears to life, and then adds the horrific twist, that the machines then turn on their masters, although slightly after the Terminator franchise had started rolling.  Surely this fear is easier to relate to than that the girl you bully at school may turn out to possess supernatural powers she can deploy for revenge purposes...The movie also deals with alienation while in an urban environment.  Like the group stuck in the mall in George Romero's &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, the people isolated in the truck stop are at once in a familiar environment, and at the same time stuck in a totally foreign world, making it easier for the viewer to relate, and amplifying the horror felt watching it.The best bits of the film occur in the opening sequences, when the machines go crazy, decimating the world's humans.  The middle section deals with the increasing tensions between the people caught in the truck seige and the final part deals with their escape and eventual triumph over the machines, culminating in Emilio Estevez's final, hilarious quote...Maximum Overdrive is a fantastic modern horror movie, bringing terror to familiar situations, and Post-Blackout, I recommend you watch this movie again and allow yourself to think &quot;What if...&quot;",5,Essential Post-Blackout viewing,1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,2382,"['Anyone', 'caught', 'Blackout', '2003', 'must', 'surely', 'have', 'thought', 'movie', 'When', 'T.V', 'stopped', 'working', 'familiar', 'drone', 'fridge', 'was', 'eerily', 'gone', 'trucks', 'kept', 'rumbling', 'unlit', 'streets', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'psychotic', 'roar', 'lawnmower', 'springing', 'life', 'chasing', 'down', 'street', 'have', 'two', 'confessions', 'make.1', 'hate', 'almost', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptions', 'two.2', 'two', 'like', 'are', 'Carrie', 'Maximum', 'Overdrive.Maximum', 'Overdrive', 'great', 'film', 'hear', 'out', 'clicking', 'quot', 'Unhelpful', 'review', 'quot', 'button', '.First', 'set', 'situation', 'can', 'relate', 'everyday', 'life', 'urban', 'environment', 'compare', 'empty', 'hotel', 'top', 'mountain', 'example.It', 'preys', 'one', 'biggest', '21st', 'Century', 'fears', 'are', 'longer', 'control', 'environment', 'Humankind', 'become', 'so', 'detached', 'everyday', 'rigours', 'surviving', 'ancestors', 'went', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'civilization', 'broke', 'down', 'electricity', 'fridge', 'food', 'machines', 'information', 'phones', 'Maximum', 'Overdrive', 'brings', 'fears', 'life', 'then', 'horrific', 'twist', 'machines', 'then', 'turn', 'masters', 'slightly', 'Terminator', 'franchise', 'had', 'started', 'rolling', 'Surely', 'fear', 'easier', 'relate', 'girl', 'bully', 'school', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'possess', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'can', 'deploy', 'revenge', 'purposes', 'movie', 'also', 'alienation', 'urban', 'environment', 'group', 'stuck', 'mall', 'George', 'Romero', 'quot', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'quot', 'people', 'isolated', 'truck', 'stop', 'are', 'once', 'familiar', 'environment', 'same', 'time', 'stuck', 'totally', 'foreign', 'world', 'making', 'easier', 'viewer', 'relate', 'amplifying', 'horror', 'felt', 'watching', 'it.The', 'best', 'bits', 'film', 'occur', 'opening', 'sequences', 'when', 'machines', 'go', 'crazy', 'decimating', 'world', 'humans', 'middle', 'section', 'deals', 'increasing', 'tensions', 'people', 'caught', 'truck', 'seige', 'final', 'part', 'deals', 'escape', 'eventual', 'triumph', 'machines', 'culminating', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'final', 'hilarious', 'quote', 'Maximum', 'Overdrive', 'fantastic', 'modern', 'horror', 'movie', 'bringing', 'terror', 'familiar', 'situations', 'Post-Blackout', 'recommend', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'allow', 'think', 'quot', 'What', 'quot']",N/A

It would've been interesting to see more of the carnage caused by the machines in other places{You do, but not for very long}. It seems that only the trucks are coming to life and not the cars. You see a steamroller in one scene and a lawnmower later but Stephen must be very fond of trucks.

Anchor Bay has done a splendid job with this box-office bomb (yet one of my favorite films), from the disc (that looks like the front of the toy company truck),The chapter card/poster replica, the menus(the main menu and extras menu include the two main AC/DC songs from the film, but the main menu is the only place on the disc where you will hear the entire ""Shook Me All Night Long"" instead of just music snippets like on other discs from big-name companies), video, sound, and extras, which is my only gripe: NOT ENOUGH! Sure, a trailer and King bio are good, but what about commentary (I'm sure that Emilio Estevez, Yeardley Smith, and Stephen King would have been up to it, don't you?), still galleries, TV spots, behind the scenes,interviews, the whole nine yards? Anchor Bay should consider doing a special edition of this title(along with My Science Project, Condorman, and any title that doesn't have extras. Sure, I'd like a DVD of my favorite movie as much as the next guy, but I'd like my movies with at least a trailer and commentary, or just a trailer would be fine).

This was the very first movie that Steven King did himself, and I think it might have been the last? In the trailer, Steven King says somthing like ""if you want it done right, you have to do it yourself, and I will scare you"" but i gotta honestly say, he failed at that unfortunalty.... I remember when it first came out it did scare me, but i was about 6 years old at the time and the big boys and grown up's where watching it.... but years later when I found out that AC/DC had done a soundtrack to a movie, i went and rented it.... And was plesently suprised to see it was that movie that scared me all those years ago. But the second time around did nothing to scare me. Overall, the movie i dont think is that bad, its definitly not scary, its not the best acting, its not totally suspensfull, and it has some weird twists and turns... but to quote AC/DC's rhythem guitarist Malcolm Young ""It's not all that great of a movie, but its still better then alot of the crap you see these days!"" And I fully agree with him!Sure, yeah, the soundtrack is mostly 95% AC/DC and the album soundtrack to this movie is AC/DC's ""who made who"" but that isnt what makes me have a liking to the film.... actually, infact, I dont quite think AC/DC's music blends in with the picture to be honest! well, some do... but one that puzzles me is ""For those about to rock"" beeing played when they sneak over to the showers and then into the sewer pipes.... I dont understand any conenction with the song, music and scene to be quite honest... and a few others i could point out just dont match the moment or mood with the music thats selected, or mixed in at wrong moments... if you know what i mean?But apart from that, The movie as you shoudlve read by now is about a comet going over the world, and the machines come to life....and then the story goes into a group of people who are strandard in a gas station ...yadda yadda yadda.... my one question about the plot is, why dont the cars come alive? but anyway, the performance from the actors is not spectaculer.... but dont get me wrong, i hate award winning perfromances... so im ok with it, ive seen a hell of alot worse! The movie is allright... but i dont recomend you pay alot for it... i was able to pick mine up pretty cheap.The bonus features arnt anything to praise.

I have probably seen it about 150 times and continue to find enjoyment.  There is a review posted that completly bashes this movie and basically tells readers not to waste their time.  Well, I have to disagree.  While the mvie is not nearly as good as the book(are they ever???), it still has strong entertainment value.First, it humorous and not because it's cheesy, but because it is funny!  The dialgoue between characters, the situations they are put in and the reactions some have to the machines taking over; are all reasons to watch this movie.The acting might not be the best, but by no means, is it bad.  Emilio Estevez is our main character, and does a fine job as Bubba, an ex-convict, short-order diner cook.  His boss(who's name I can't remember), plays your typical Texan in charge of his business, who amazingly has a secret stash of bazookas and guns below the diner(perfect for antagonizing the trucks outside).

Not exactly highbrow, it is considerably more entertaining than its rating score would indicate; especially if you can connect with the parody element.Written and directed by Stephen King on a very modest special effects budget, the story shifts between idyllic small-town and redneck truck stop somewhere in North Carolina. A UFO has somehow gained control over most machines (insert ""Metropolis"" here) which proceed to slaughter a considerable number of people.Neither the film nor King's original story seem to have anything profound to say about aliens, humans, or machines. That is probably for the best as deep philosophy would only get in the way of the entertainment value of this thing.Like the farm house in ""Night of the Living Dead"", those who remain alive take refuge in a nearby truck stop. Pat Hingle gives an over-the-top performance as the greedy owner who just happens to have a small arsenal of weapons concealed on the premises. Yeardley Smith as a stressed-out newlywed provides additional comic relief. Emilio Estavez and Laura Harrington provide the story's romantic element. Music is by King's favorite band AC/DC. Although everything from lawnmowers to blow dryers get into the act, most of the focus is on the eighteen-wheelers which besiege the truck stop around the clock.Then again, what do I know?

The cheesy 80's is written all over it and it's not the mature work of Stephen King, who has come up with scarier material than this. Stars Emilio Estevez as the leader of a group of truck stop diner who have to band together to defeat possessed trucks. A comet that passed through the skies left an eerie green cloud over the town and has made it possible for human's inventions, electronic or otherwise, to rebel against humans. Soon, all the trucks come to life and drive themselves, killing off their drivers. This film is really nothing exciting or even scary. Stephen King has created more frightening horror films. Even if he was trying to go for a science fiction type of horror genre, it did'nt work. Maybe because it was the 80's and this is just one bad apple in the bunch.Yeardley Smith, best known as the voice of Lisa Simpson from The Simpsons is part of the cast. It's refreshing to see her in person and in movies outside from the cartoons. She was also in the short lived early 90's series &quot;Herman's Head&quot;. This is definately not Emilio Estevez's best work. About a year earlier, he had performed in The Breakfast Club in which he did a much better job. He would do the same later in the 90's with the Mighty Ducks movies. The trucks are funny to look at and the humans being killed by them is not as frightening as it should be. Especially comedic is the truck with the Green Goblin head on it. This movie, which is a sort of camp classic, is more enjoyable if it does'tn take itself seriously. This movie DOES try to be serious horror. The ending implies that the survivors made it possible for the aliens in the green cloud to be defeated and it is supposed to be a sort of serious film about survival. But it's not really a good film for that type of plot. I feel this movie would be better to look at in Mystery Science Theatre 3000 where they showcase old camp, bad movies with ad lib jokes. Then maybe this movie would be better to look at. But if you're into the 80's, Stephen King (no matter what he does) and Emilio Estevez, this is the film for you.

562755,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B0000509C5,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 1]","Maximum Overdrive has earned a place in movie history as a dud, both critically and commercially(my memory's not too good on this, but I do believe it did so-so at the box office).  I guess expectations were high considering Stephen King was taking on writing and directing credits himself.  People had been complaining for so long about how other directors and writers had botched King's works when adapting them for the big screen that it seemed like a great idea to have King himself have free reign over one of his stories.  The results?  Not what people were expecting.  I think a big reason this movie failed is because people were expecting a truly frightening film from King.  I mean, Stephen King is a household name and is synonymous with some of the most well known horror stories of all time.  Even someone who's never read a book in their lives knows this.  One can only assume that expectations for this film might have been a little high.  Much to everybody's shock and disappointment, King turned out, not a nail biting tale of terror, but a campy drive-in B movie!  Stephen King is a man with a sense of humor.  Even in his scariest novels he can't resist cracking a joke wherever he can.  His black humor can be found in practically everything he does.  He's even described himself as the ""literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries"".  When this film came out he described it as a ""cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac and fries"".  Now, you take the subject matter of Maximum Overdrive(kind of a cross between Night of the Living Dead and King's own Christine) and you gotta think to yourself, ""could this really be scary?""  Of course not.  No director could make such a ridiculous concept rise above the level of B movie status, not even Stephen King.  A story like this plays out a bit scarier on the printed page than it does on the screen.  King isn't a moron, and seemed well aware of this.  Obviously his intent wasn't to make a scary film , otherwise he would have chosen a totally different story to make a film out of.  The first few minutes of the movie set the tone as King tries to get money from a profanity spewing ATM machine.  Then, during a pileup on a malfunctioning bridge, what appears to be a human head flies through a car's windshield, but you soon see it was only a watermelon.  It's all camp, folks.  And I'm not sure audiences knew exactly how to take this.  So this was horror master Stephen King's directorial debut?  Was he making a comedy??  Or was this just a really bad attempt at a horror film?  Most people thought it was the latter, and just filed it away as a miserable failure.  King has since disowned this movie and hasn't made one since, probably never will.  Hey, if he's unhappy with it, then he's unhappy with it.  I like it personally.  It's certainly not perfect.

Also, the soundtrack is by AC/DC (which, by the way, you can buy the soundtrack on CD. It's titled ""Who Made Who?""). King's only directorial film is an underrated gem. The film's plot: For a week in 1987, a mysterious comet was floating over Earth. During this week, we have truck stop customers and employees, led by Emilio Estevez (who plays a cook in this movie), trying to stay alive when automobiles and appliances come ""alive"" and start killing people.Stephen King was forced to make some cuts to this film in order to avoid an X rating for violence. The scenes cut, to this day have not been reinstated in any release, thus the only version in circulation is the original theatrical cut. The scenes are reported to total around 13 seconds and include:- Six Seconds of the Dixie Boy shoot out.- Three seconds of the steam roller running over the boy.- Three seconds of the salesman's face falling into his lap.Based on Stephen King's novel ""Trucks"", this film will satisfy any King or horror movie fan.
