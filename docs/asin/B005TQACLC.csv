BS obviously screwed herself up so much she has to fill the stage with talented dancers, flashing lights and ridiculous props to distract you from the lip-synching and stiff dancing.While I understand she's older and cannot move the way she used to, she dances worse than Madonna, but Madonna is effing 50-something! So I don't buy the age excuse. I'm thinking she's on medication for Bipolar Disorder making her movements stiff and uncoordinated looking. Could I do what she does? Nope, but damn sure, if I was getting paid untold amounts of money, I'd be like Madonna rocking it like nobody's business.I felt bad for fans that paid outrageous ticket prices.

1503767,A1MFDFUGEVNIFK,B005TQACLC,AyJay,"[7, 8]","I went to see Britney's FEMME FATALE tour at the M.E.N. Arena and enjoyed it for the most part and I'd recommend the DVD/Blu Ray release of the concert to Britney fans as most of the concert is live [the choruses of the dancier tracks and a few other parts are clearly prerecorded].But... I'll be honest and say that if you don't like Britney, then you won't think the concert is really anything to shout about; Some parts are clearly using prerecorded vocals, it is a fairly short concert [this is because some of the songs Britney performs are shortened] and it isn't as 'showy' and bright as most other pop concerts.Britney also does not connect with her audiences very well; there was a few rehearsed ""How you doing [insert name]?"", but I don't think that counts.***Anyway, on to the music...Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is the highlight of the evening, as she does indeed perform it 100% live which shows that, yes, she CAN sing.Trouble For Me and Till The World Ends are my favourite tracks on the Femme Fatale album and are great performed on stage, although some parts of these performances use prerecorded vocals.Another must-see, for me, is when she performs If U Seek Amy. It's probably my favourite Britney single and her vocals are great on the live version. The classic single Toxic also has more zest to it when performed live and I love the oriental arrangements in this portion of the show.Another standout is when Britney sings her verse from the Rihanna S&M; remix. It's a shame that she only sings her verse; it is short and I was left wanting more.***I also love that the tour has one solid storyline holding it all together; There is a total of five segments for the tour, portraying a story in which Spears is a secret agent, who is chased by a stalker. The first section of the concert consequently features her escaping from prison along with other female inmates.The second segment begins with a video intermission in which a stalker reveals that Spears is a secret agent. A video interlude in which the stalker talks about femme fatales in history sees the beginning of the third section, which features an Egyptian theme with fireworks and acrobatics.The fourth segment is preceded by another video interlude, featuring Spears changing clothes and choosing between different passports inside a hotel room. The encore begins with a video interlude of Spears capturing the stalker, and is followed by two performances in which she defeats a group of ninjas.***I've gone to watch all of Britney's world tours and have to admit that I was saddened to see that the rag mags are semi-right for once; although it's not as obvious as it is in her Circus tour, Britney does look robotic a lot of the time and her dancing does look somewhat stiff.I'm not having a dig at her herself, but maybe whoever is shoving her onstage should think twice, as she doesn't look comfortable and as if she's enjoying performing - she actually looked almost scared at times. For her Oops! I Did It Again and Onyx Hotel tours Britney has a mesmerizing stage presence and looked so happy to be there, and I would love her to feel like that again, but that hasn't happened yet.- - - - - -Setlist- - - - - -Hold It Against MeUp N Down3Piece of MeBig Fat BassHow I RollLace and LeatherIf U Seek AmyGimme MoreDrop Dead) BeautifulBoysDon't Let Me Be the Last to KnowBaby One More Time/S&M; (Remix)Trouble for MeI'm a Slave 4 UI Wanna GoWomanizerToxicTill the World EndsOn selected US tour dates Britney sings He About to Lose Me and a cover of Madonna's Burning Up.

1503768,A3KXRZCN90F9BB,B005TQACLC,"Carlos ""Carlos Says Relax""","[1, 1]","I had the opportunity to attend Britney's concert in Chile in november, and I loved it... I had been waiting to see her in concert for 13 years, and it was just one of the best concerts of my life, and the one I paid the most to see. It was pure energy for 90 minutes, plus the fact that she did sing live in a LOT of the songs (not all of them), it was a fantastic concert. Well, after seeing her in concert, I got the DVD and was expecting to be amazed by the show one more time, but this is just a HORRIBLY made DVD.Where to start..1. The cameras are WAY too static and barely move and follow Britney and the dancers, it just makes it really boring, plus the angles are really bad, they're filming from above the stage, which just makes it look small, it's like watching a security camera footage! When you capture a live concert you want to get the excitement and the greatness of the stage and effects... Fail! Bottom line: the director should never work again and probably killed!!2. The editing also plain sucks... I know my stuff since I go to film school, and whoever post-produced this concert was absolutely stoned or it was their first day at the job. The cuts are completely out of time, it just a visual mess they've created.3. Dubbed vocals. For the first time ever (and I'm a huge Brit fan) I am 100% sure that she DOES sing live. The un-dubbed version of this concert was leaked and posted on YouTube and you can really tell the difference, but Epix, for some stupid reason, decided it was a good idea to replace ALL the vocals with the studio versions. Knowing that Britney sang live at the actual show, and that she is heavily criticized for her lipsyncing, it would have been amazing to hear her live vocals on the concert DVD.4. The back cover looks like it was made by a 5 year old (not offending any 5-year olds!), the color is nowhere near similar to the ones used on the front cover or the Femme Fatale CD artwork. I have seen a billion fanmade covers online that are way prettier!5. And finally, but not less important... ""Leather And Lace"" on the menu.. instead of the actual name of the song, ""Lace And Leather"".... REALLY?? This is Britney's second DVD with wrong song titles! You would think that for a release as anticipated as this one there would be some sort of Quality Control process... I guess not.Having YouTube and my own recorded HD videos from the show I attended, I just prefer watching something else to remember this tour, to watch it and get excited and wanting to jump in my room. I just don't watch this DVD anymore. It's nowhere near as exciting and energetic as the ""Live From Las Vegas"" or ""Live And More"" DVDs.Look for this concert on YouTube. If you see it and are satisfied with it and actually like it, then buy it. Honestly, I would have skipped it.",2,"Amazing show, horrible DVD",1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,2804,"['had', 'opportunity', 'attend', 'Britney', 'concert', 'Chile', 'november', 'loved', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'concert', '13', 'years', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'concerts', 'life', 'one', 'paid', 'most', 'see', 'was', 'pure', 'energy', '90', 'minutes', 'fact', 'did', 'sing', 'live', 'LOT', 'songs', 'not', 'was', 'fantastic', 'concert', 'Well', 'seeing', 'concert', 'got', 'DVD', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'amazed', 'show', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'just', 'HORRIBLY', 'made', 'DVD.Where', 'start..1', 'cameras', 'are', 'WAY', 'too', 'static', 'barely', 'move', 'follow', 'Britney', 'dancers', 'just', 'really', 'boring', 'angles', 'are', 'really', 'bad', ""'re"", 'filming', 'stage', 'just', 'look', 'small', 'watching', 'security', 'camera', 'footage', 'When', 'capture', 'live', 'concert', 'want', 'get', 'excitement', 'greatness', 'stage', 'effects', 'Fail', 'Bottom', 'line', 'director', 'should', 'never', 'work', 'again', 'probably', 'killed', '2', 'editing', 'also', 'plain', 'sucks', 'know', 'stuff', 'go', 'film', 'school', 'whoever', 'post-produced', 'concert', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stoned', 'was', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'cuts', 'are', 'completely', 'time', 'just', 'visual', 'mess', ""'ve"", 'created.3', 'Dubbed', 'vocals', 'first', 'time', 'ever', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Brit', 'fan', 'am', '100', '%', 'sure', 'sing', 'live', 'un-dubbed', 'version', 'concert', 'was', 'leaked', 'posted', 'YouTube', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'difference', 'Epix', 'stupid', 'reason', 'decided', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'replace', 'vocals', 'studio', 'versions', 'Knowing', 'Britney', 'sang', 'live', 'actual', 'show', 'heavily', 'criticized', 'lipsyncing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'hear', 'live', 'vocals', 'concert', 'DVD.4', 'back', 'cover', 'was', 'made', '5', 'year', 'old', 'not', 'offending', '5-year', 'olds', 'color', 'nowhere', 'near', 'similar', 'ones', 'used', 'front', 'cover', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'CD', 'artwork', 'have', 'seen', 'billion', 'fanmade', 'covers', 'online', 'are', 'way', 'prettier', '5', 'finally', 'not', 'less', 'important', 'Leather', 'Lace', 'menu..', 'instead', 'actual', 'name', 'song', 'Lace', 'Leather', 'REALLY', 'Britney', 'second', 'DVD', 'wrong', 'song', 'titles', 'would', 'think', 'release', 'as', 'anticipated', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'sort', 'Quality', 'Control', 'process', 'guess', 'not.Having', 'YouTube', 'own', 'recorded', 'HD', 'videos', 'show', 'attended', 'just', 'prefer', 'watching', 'something', 'else', 'remember', 'tour', 'watch', 'get', 'excited', 'wanting', 'jump', 'room', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'DVD', 'anymore', 'nowhere', 'near', 'exciting', 'energetic', 'Live', 'From', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Live', 'More', 'DVDs.Look', 'concert', 'YouTube', 'see', 'are', 'satisfied', 'actually', 'then', 'buy', 'Honestly', 'would', 'have', 'skipped']",Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour

1503770,AY41G47HBME8Q,B005TQACLC,ChicagoScorp,"[4, 10]","When I first learned that Britney was going to tour, I got myself pumped to shell out big dollars to see the Femme Fatale tour because I figured she'd put on a great show. I had saw Beyonce, U2, Janet Jackson and several other major music concerts around the same time as Britney was touring and I just had to add Britney to my list. What I didn't know was that to sit in almost an identical location for the Femme Fatale concert as I did at Beyonce's  I Am tour, the Femme Fatale price was significantly higher, as in another minimum $100. So I decided if I can't get good seats, I won't go. So for months, I'm trapped in DVD Land, patiently waiting and hoping that the Femme Fatale concert will become available on DVD. I became a Britney Femme Fatale DVD Stalker. Guess what? Now only was it available on DVD, it was available in Blu-ray! Talk about being frantic, I quickly pre-ordered the Femme Fatale Blu-ray and waited for it to arrive. Then I read a few comments about Britney lip syncing and after some thought, I changed the Blu-ray to DVD.The DVD came yesterday and I rushed home, turned on the big HDEF TV, kicked up the surround sound, made popcorn, turned off all of the lights because I knew that this concert was going to be fierce and I wanted to ""live"" in it. Well, all I can write is that I'VE BEEN HAD! I'VE BEEN TOOK! LED ASTRAY! RUN AMUCK! HOODWINKED! BAMBOOZLED! Here's a quick listing of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the Femme Fatale DVD:1. Good -  Britney's backup dancers were really good, especially the men. The choreography was good, not mind-blowing, but good. Oh yeah, the theatrics were pretty good too;2. Bad - Britney herself, didn't bring the crisp, unbelievable dancing. She was dancing like she was dog-tired, and from what? Definitely not from singing and dancing simultaneously!3. Ugly - Britney  lip synced approximately 90% of her songs.I fell asleep TWICE, woke up and watched the songs that I missed. I'm glad I didn't shell out $$$ to see lip syncing in a live concert. I figure, if Madonna, who is like 52 years old and Beyonce and Shakira who are in the same age bracket as Britney can all sing and dance their mudda-shut-your-mouth tails off in their concerts then if Britney is lip syncing, her dance moves should in the least be slammin'.  After watching Femme Fatale one time, I thought it was uneventful, quite dull and thought to myself, hmm, I should have watched Lady Gaga first. Still, I favor Britney. She comes off during the concert as a very appreciative and nice person and also because I'm glad that she appears to have pulled herself together after the drama from a few years ago, I will watch Femme Fatal again - but probably after watching the Lady Gaga Monster Tour.",2,DIS SUM BS (Britney Spears yawl),1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,2737,"['When', 'first', 'learned', 'Britney', 'was', 'going', 'tour', 'got', 'pumped', 'shell', 'out', 'big', 'dollars', 'see', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'tour', 'figured', ""'d"", 'put', 'great', 'show', 'had', 'saw', 'Beyonce', 'U2', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'several', 'other', 'major', 'music', 'concerts', 'same', 'time', 'Britney', 'was', 'touring', 'just', 'had', 'add', 'Britney', 'list', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'sit', 'almost', 'identical', 'location', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'concert', 'did', 'Beyonce', 'Am', 'tour', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'price', 'was', 'significantly', 'higher', 'minimum', '100', 'So', 'decided', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'seats', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'So', 'months', ""'m"", 'trapped', 'DVD', 'Land', 'patiently', 'waiting', 'hoping', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'concert', 'will', 'become', 'available', 'DVD', 'became', 'Britney', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'DVD', 'Stalker', 'Guess', 'what', 'Now', 'only', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'was', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'Talk', 'being', 'frantic', 'quickly', 'pre-ordered', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'Blu-ray', 'waited', 'arrive', 'Then', 'read', 'few', 'comments', 'Britney', 'lip', 'syncing', 'thought', 'changed', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD.The', 'DVD', 'came', 'yesterday', 'rushed', 'home', 'turned', 'big', 'HDEF', 'TV', 'kicked', 'up', 'surround', 'sound', 'made', 'popcorn', 'turned', 'off', 'lights', 'knew', 'concert', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'fierce', 'wanted', 'live', 'Well', 'can', 'write', ""'VE"", 'BEEN', 'HAD', ""'VE"", 'BEEN', 'TOOK', 'LED', 'ASTRAY', 'RUN', 'AMUCK', 'HOODWINKED', 'BAMBOOZLED', 'Here', 'quick', 'listing', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'DVD:1', 'Good', 'Britney', 'backup', 'dancers', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'especially', 'men', 'choreography', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'mind-blowing', 'good', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'theatrics', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', '2', 'Bad', 'Britney', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'crisp', 'unbelievable', 'dancing', 'was', 'dancing', 'was', 'dog-tired', 'what', 'Definitely', 'not', 'singing', 'dancing', 'simultaneously', '3', 'Ugly', 'Britney', 'lip', 'synced', 'approximately', '90', '%', 'songs.I', 'fell', 'asleep', 'TWICE', 'woke', 'up', 'watched', 'songs', 'missed', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'shell', 'out', 'see', 'lip', 'syncing', 'live', 'concert', 'figure', 'Madonna', 'who', '52', 'years', 'old', 'Beyonce', 'Shakira', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'bracket', 'Britney', 'can', 'all', 'sing', 'dance', 'mudda-shut-your-mouth', 'tails', 'concerts', 'then', 'Britney', 'lip', 'syncing', 'dance', 'moves', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'slammin', 'watching', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'one', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'uneventful', 'quite', 'dull', 'thought', 'myself', 'hmm', 'should', 'have', 'watched', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'first', 'Still', 'favor', 'Britney', 'off', 'concert', 'very', 'appreciative', 'nice', 'person', 'also', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'pulled', 'together', 'drama', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'will', 'watch', 'Femme', 'Fatal', 'again', 'probably', 'watching', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'Monster', 'Tour']",Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour

I'm a huge Britney fan & I think she killed it on this DVD. My favorite performances are ""Hold It Against Me"", ""Up N' Down"", ""How I Roll"", ""Gimme More"", ""(Drop Dead) Beautiful"", ""If U Seek Amy"", ""S&M"", ""Trouble For Me"" & ""Till The World Ends"". Nicki Minaj & Sabi also make special appearances during the show which is amazing. I do have some things I would like to say though especially to those who are writing negative reviews. I'm so tired of hearing people point out that Britney lip syncs. First of all, Britney has always lip synced for most of her performances. If you haven't accepted that by now, then there's no reason why you should have even bought this DVD or watched it. Us true Britney fans know that she does sing live sometimes & when she doesn't, we're okay with it because we know what her voice sounds like, we know that she's talented & we know she's going to put on one hell of a show. Plus you'd be surprised at all the other big artists out there that lip sync or sing to a backing track like Britney does most of the time. She did sing with a backing track during this show but the vocals were dubbed over for some reason. You can hear her in several parts of the show. Also, I'm tired of people saying that Britney can't dance like she used to. So what?! She's 30 years old now, she's had 2 kids which DOES change your body but she knows how to work what she's got & put on an amazing show. I was really impressed with alot of her dance moves & how much confidence she's finally showing again. I saw her on her Circus tour & she was amazing but you could tell she was a little nervous. Here, she's not nervous at all & she looks so happy. And to whoever commented that her dancers outshine her during ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", I really don't know what performance you were watching because she did the choreography perfectly & kept up with them at all times. She is Britney Spears, she's broken countless records, sold out countless shows & stayed on top for almost 15 years. She's a legend & an icon & if you're a Britney fan, you'll love this DVD. If you can't move past the lip syncing thing or the dancing thing, you just need to stop paying attention to Britney & find something else to do with your time.",5,The Femme Fatale,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,2340,"['finally', 'got', 'hands', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'Britney', 'latest', 'tour', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Britney', 'fan', 'think', 'killed', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'performances', 'are', 'Hold', 'Me', 'N', 'Down', 'How', 'Roll', 'Gim', 'More', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Beautiful', 'U', 'Seek', 'Amy', 'S', 'M', 'Trouble', 'Me', 'Till', 'World', 'Ends', 'Nicki', 'Minaj', 'Sabi', 'also', 'make', 'special', 'appearances', 'show', 'amazing', 'do', 'have', 'things', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'writing', 'negative', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'so', 'tired', 'hearing', 'people', 'point', 'out', 'Britney', 'lip', 'syncs', 'First', 'Britney', 'always', 'lip', 'synced', 'most', 'performances', 'have', ""n't"", 'accepted', 'now', 'then', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'even', 'bought', 'DVD', 'watched', 'Us', 'true', 'Britney', 'fans', 'know', 'sing', 'live', 'sometimes', 'when', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'okay', 'know', 'what', 'voice', 'sounds', 'know', 'talented', 'know', 'going', 'put', 'one', 'hell', 'show', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'other', 'big', 'artists', 'there', 'lip', 'sync', 'sing', 'backing', 'track', 'Britney', 'most', 'time', 'did', 'sing', 'backing', 'track', 'show', 'vocals', 'were', 'dubbed', 'reason', 'can', 'hear', 'several', 'parts', 'show', 'Also', ""'m"", 'tired', 'people', 'saying', 'Britney', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'used', 'So', 'what', '30', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'had', '2', 'kids', 'DOES', 'change', 'body', 'how', 'work', 'what', 'got', 'put', 'amazing', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'alot', 'dance', 'moves', 'how', 'much', 'confidence', 'finally', 'showing', 'again', 'saw', 'Circus', 'tour', 'was', 'amazing', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'Here', 'not', 'nervous', 'so', 'happy', 'whoever', 'commented', 'dancers', 'outshine', ""'m"", 'Slave', '4', 'U', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'performance', 'were', 'watching', 'did', 'choreography', 'perfectly', 'kept', 'up', 'times', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'broken', 'countless', 'records', 'sold', 'out', 'countless', 'shows', 'stayed', 'top', 'almost', '15', 'years', 'legend', 'icon', ""'re"", 'Britney', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'love', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'lip', 'syncing', 'thing', 'dancing', 'thing', 'just', 'need', 'stop', 'paying', 'attention', 'Britney', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'do', 'time']",Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour

The performances felt kinda rush and fast paced at times. Her dancing wasn't all that stellar. Her dancers had more energy and effort than her which is sad. After since her breakdown and having kids, her dancing and personality haven't been the same. The good news is her personality seems like it's slowly coming back based on what I saw on ""I Am Britney Jean"". I personally wouldn't go out to watch Britney in concert. Her performance skills are just not interesting and are lifeless. She's not on the same level as Beyonce or Janet when it comes to that aspect. Her dancing and her movements remind me of Madonna except that Madonna has more energy and her shows are usually more visually stunning. The middle part and I guess the few last parts were somewhat interesting.The lap dance gave me Janet teas but even that doesn't even comes close to Janet's. I think the only thing she had going on here were the outfits, the songs, and her body. That's about it. I think The Onyx Hotel one remains her best one.

After reading more reviews, I find it's because they dubbed over her singing specifically for the DVD.  Very disappointing.Don't get me wrong with the rest of the review, I have been a fan of Britney since she hit the scene but the woman has no grace.  You can chalk it up to bad knees and what not but she just clomps her way through the steps.  A lot of the time, she's upstaged by the talent of her dancers.  It's a given that she's not the same as she was ten years ago but she should exploit her strengths not try to keep the same ol', same ol'.  It seems forced.

It was amazing, although I could tell it wasn't really live.  I've seen her Live from Las Vegas and Onyx Hotel tours.  Both were pretty amazing.  I went to the Femme Fatale tour last summer.  My friends and I didn't have great seats so I was hoping for Britney to run around the stage more and do more.  I may as well have just watched this DVD at home.  It seems she did more during the Circus tour.  I'm questioning whether to go to her next show, whenever it may be.  I went to Gaga's concert and she did a heck of a lot more.  I've also seen Adam Lambert on a tiny stage but his presence and voice just rocked the house.  Britney is not all about the voice but she is about dancing.  I don't like that she lip syncs; I'd rather her sing bad and dance her butt off.  At least you know it's live.  Also the ""what's up Toronto? I love you Toronto!"" seemed a bit fake; possibly pre-recorded.  Even calling the fan up on stage for Lace and Leather seemed off.  Britney just sat on the prop onstage while her dancers/back up singers did all the work picking.  Maybe it's just me but I would be so embarrassed hiding behind a recording track and lip syncing.  I would walk off the stage with my tail between my legs and I'm surprised Britney didn't.  I didn't give it a 1 star rating because I liked the show, it's just Britney seemed to be in the way or prevented the show from being 5 stars.  I love Britney but I wonder what is going on with her.  Supposedly she had 2 knee surgeries and that may be why she doesn't dance like she used to.  She also had 2 kids.  Madonna has been through a lot.  Heck, Mariah Carey had 2 kids and is still kicking onstage.  Beyonce was pregnant and doing shows.  So was Gwen Stefani.  Something else is going on here because of other performers can still kick butt while pregnant, after pregnant, surgeries, etc... then she can too.  Heck Michael Jackson went through hell and back and his last concert was better than ever!  Oh and he was dancing and it was live.

I caught the ""Femme Fatale"" tour in Columbus here in Ohio this past August, and it was a fantastic show, period. The never-ending debate about whether Britney lip-syncs or not is totally besides the point, as far as I'm concerned, you go to the show to experience the totallity of it. So when I saw this DVD/CD deluxe edition at a big-box retailer the other day, I just had to pick it up.""Britney Spears Live: the Femme Fatale Tour"" (DVD; 86 min.) brings her show from Toronto, and it was exactly the same set I saw in Columbus. The set list is heavy on ""Femme Fatale"", which is a great thing, as I happen to think it is Britney's best album, period. For me this DVD is simply a great memento of a fun show I saw a few months ago. But truth be told, I would not have bought this but for the enticing bonus CD that came with this.The bonus CD (10 tracks; 56 min.) brings a great collection of remixes and one new track. There are three remixes of each ""Would You Hold It Against Me"", ""Till The World Ends"" and ""I Wanna Go"", and while you may think that is overkill, in fact those remixes are quite nice, never unrecognizable from the origial track, but done creatively in a way that I'm enjoying those songs in a new way. There is one new track, ""Scary"", which would've fitted very nicely onto the ""Femme Fatale"" album proper.

In this case , the only absentees are the band, making the music seem all pre-recorded. Nevertheless, it's still a fantastic mix from start till finish.While her Las Vegas DVD showcased Britney's hits up to her third album, Femme Fatale featured songs mostly from her new CD of the same name, with some from Blackout and Circus. Old gems are not forgotten. Toxic gets accelerated and Boys received an Egyptian opening.What really got me going was Hold It Against Me, Till The World Ends and I Wanna Go - the last number had me putting my hands in the air and going Oh! Oh! Oh!...Generally, singers who dance vigorously will be also breathing heavily. Somehow, I don't see or hear that here.

1503785,A2DO1IA1F3N8B6,B005TQACLC,R. Christman,"[10, 13]","Where do I begin with this concert Blu-ray/DVD? You know when you're left with questions after watching a concert Blu-ray/DVD that it's a failure all around. That's the only way to describe this travesty. Was there even a point of putting it on Blu-ray? Because you'd have to be both high and deaf to enjoy it? I'll never know.Ok let's get down to it. The obvious being the lip-syncing. Why ignore the elephant in the room? I know this is pretty standard for Britney because she's done it her entire career but why did she make the decision to have her pre-recorded, or ""live"" vocals dubbed over? She would've gotten some credibility as people would believe she was singing live. And yes, it was Britney's decision, Epix released a statement stating that it was up to the artist. It begs the question as to why she'd want that. What's the point of being a singer if you don't like your voice or you don't want others to hear it? Why do fans have to fight tooth and nail just to hear you live? It's not like your albums aren't edited enough to where you sound robotic and unnatural. You're better of waiting for the demos and stems to leak. What adds insult to injury are the 30 seconds in total, performances with Sabi and Nicki Minaj which had more live singing than from Britney and it was her concert/tour. Also, does Britney and her team think we're stupid? They dubbed over 'Baby One More Time' and 'Slave 4 u' with the album vocals, you're talking vocals from albums that are over a decade old. I give up.The dancing, more like what dancing? Whipping your hair isn't dancing, Willow Smith does that and still sings live. ""arm dancing"" isn't dancing either. I used to be able to defend Britney and say ""she dances really hard and therefore it's ok if she lip-syncs"". These days she does neither. I gave her a major break during Circus because it was her first tour in 5 years and she went through a lot leading up to it. I've run out of excuses and can't and won't defend this.Epix and team Britney really dropped the ball as well. The cover, really? That took a lot of consideration to use the album cover. I hope they didn't think too hard with that decision. The image on the disc itself was much better. When you go to the menu and hit ""song selection"" they messed up a few song titles as well. It's 'Lace and Leather' not 'Leather and Lace', it's also 'Trouble For Me' not 'Trouble'. Did they not pay any attention at all? There's parts where they pan to the audience and it looks pixelated and choppy. And what's with the image on the back cover, the top left B&W; photo? That looks like a photo backstage, prayer circle before the show perhaps? That's not on the Blu-ray/DVD or part of the show. Is that an indication that there was extras to be included originally?In short, like I said, there's questions, and there shouldn't be while watching a concert. In my opinion, the only thing that was done correctly and would make it worthwhile are the Music Videos for each single released. And even that's not on the DVD. If you don't have Blu-ray you're screwed. What I gathered from this? Britney doesn't want to do this anymore and her team hates us all.

I attended one of her fun concerts over five months ago, and was curious to see how this concert dvd would compare.  She gave a great live performance, and watching this version exceeded my expectations of what I had set.  The following are some of the various interesting moments of this dvd:If U Seek Amy: The dancers were cleverly simulating the paparrazi.  Britney Spears was wearing a Marilyn Monroesque skirt during the performance.Gimme More: There was a unique Egyptian theme and she was wearing gold to keep with the theme (a golden two-piece).Drop Dead Gorgeous: The dancers are seen positioning themselves in gold frames, and singer Sabi makes a guest appearance.  Sabi is also known for appearing with Cobra Starship in their music video of ""You Make Me Feel"" (including lending her vocals to ""You Make Me Feel"")I Wanna Go: There is a good group sequence of the dancers carefully timing their moves with Britney Spears.Nicki Minaj appears towards the end of the concert.There is also a remixed cd with this edition, but I admit to liking the concert dvd portion more.

1503789,A29EREHE2HKK12,B005TQACLC,TheProphetFromTrailopen.com,"[10, 25]","I really believe in some ways Spears had a genius never before seen. I think her ""Live From Las Vegas"" DVD, which I reviewed here at Amazon, was simply the best show ever put on by a single female performer, and I've been going to the theater for over 50 years. Britney had a breakdown. She has not been able to get in touch with her creativity since. These meds thicken and slow you down, and confuse you into thinking all is OK, when it isn't. I saw her on stage in ""Circus."" I was afraid she was going to stop on stage and start to cry. The show was smoke and mirrors with no real dancing from Britney. This is the same thing: a sense that everything is moving s-o-o  s-l-o-w-l-y and without any enjoyment on her part.  I feel for the girl. I do. It takes tremendous guts to do what she's doing, but she's running out of time, and you can only play the ""Emporer's New Clothes"" routine for so long (as Empress). Soon there may be boos and jokes on late-night comedy shows. The hands-off-Britney halo she carries now could vanish, and what will her support system offer her then? Hebephrenia? It's no accident her mental-health professionals are lost:Her psychiatrist appears to have been chosen by the same motivation(s) she used to choose the 48 hr. husband #1, who never failed to sell her out to the tabloids as much as possible after their 48 hr marriage. Husband #2, Kfed, performed as much mean-spiritted psychological homicide, theft and adultery on the poor girl as was possible, topping off his decapitation of her sanity by stealing her children. Then Sam Lufti and the paparozzo Ognog. Into the mix she chose this uninspired unpublished psychiatrist, who has never done anything with people suffering with delusional states except MEDICATE THEM! See reviews for Dr. Deborah Nadel, Santa Monica, CA. Britney needs someone who has come out of schizophrenia himself, and who can hold a light unto her path.I, like Britney, entered schizophrenic processes in 1970, and have spent the last 40 years coming out of this disease. I have done so without meds and my videos on my website prove I can do the same with hers.
