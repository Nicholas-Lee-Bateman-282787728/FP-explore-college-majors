891887,A19EKT8H85AKO5,B0007VY47M,BigStory,"[3, 3]","This is a 6 disc set of the Philadelphia 76ers and the team's greatest moments. Disc 1 is the history lesson part. Various players and successful seasons are profiled. Disc 2 thru 6 are individual games presented in their interity. Darryl ""Chocolate Thunder"" Dawkins does the hosting for disc 1.The first disc is basically old material already released during the VHS days. Stuff you get include 76ers A History, rivalries with the Lakers and Celtics, 66-67/75-76/82-83/00-01 seasons, today's team, and Sixers greats(Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving, Darryl Dawkins, Maurice Cheeks, Moses Malone, Charles Barkley, and Allen Iverson).When you see clips from the 66-67 season, its amazing how much the racial make-up of the league had changed in a few short years. It's funny watching highlights from the 82-83 season. The way the players and fans looked(uniform, clothes, hair, makeup, etc) ranges from funny to frightening. The 00-01 season was all about Allen Iverson along with then Sixers president Pat Croche. Croche is one excitable dude.I thoroughly enjoyed the 82 Conference Finals game 7 at the Celtics along with the game 4 sweep of the Showtime Lakers in 83. I have never seen these games before, and although I am not a Sixers fan, I still love watching the Dr J Sixers performing at their highest. Funny how a player would give an opposing player a hand to pick him up. Haven't seen that since I started watching the NBA in the early 90's.The 1990 Semifinal game 3 between the Bull and Sixers was from a cable channel called Prism in Philly. Those were the days when the player's support shorts would show from underneath their regular team shorts. Disc 5 is game 1 between A.I.'s Sixers and the Kobe/Shaq Lakers. Then finally Disc 6 is all about Allen Iverson ""The Answer"". Again, lots of Pat Croche in this.Very nice set for fans of 76ers or fans of NBA history in general. The highlight of this set for me was watching Julius Erving finally win his long awaited championship. You do get a lot of Allen Iverson material. I didn't mind, but it will seem dated since Iverson was still protrayed as Philly's ""Answer"". Still, get the set and relive some of Dr J at his best.",4,Dr J gets his title,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2183,"['6', 'disc', 'set', 'Philadelphia', '76ers', 'team', 'greatest', 'moments', 'Disc', '1', 'history', 'lesson', 'part', 'Various', 'players', 'successful', 'seasons', 'are', 'profiled', 'Disc', '2', 'thru', '6', 'are', 'individual', 'games', 'presented', 'interity', 'Darryl', 'Chocolate', 'Thunder', 'hosting', 'disc', '1.The', 'first', 'disc', 'basically', 'old', 'material', 'already', 'released', 'VHS', 'days', 'Stuff', 'get', 'include', '76ers', 'A', 'History', 'Lakers', 'Celtics', '66-67/75-76/82-83/00-01', 'seasons', 'today', 'team', 'Sixers', 'greats', 'Wilt', 'Chamberlain', 'Julius', 'Erving', 'Darryl', 'Dawkins', 'Maurice', 'Cheeks', 'Moses', 'Malone', 'Charles', 'Barkley', 'Allen', 'Iverson', '.When', 'see', 'clips', '66-67', 'season', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'racial', 'make-up', 'league', 'had', 'changed', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'funny', 'watching', 'highlights', '82-83', 'season', 'way', 'players', 'fans', 'looked', 'uniform', 'clothes', 'hair', 'makeup', 'etc', 'funny', 'frightening', '00-01', 'season', 'was', 'Allen', 'Iverson', 'then', 'Sixers', 'president', 'Pat', 'Croche', 'Croche', 'one', 'excitable', 'dude.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', '82', 'Conference', 'Finals', 'game', '7', 'Celtics', 'game', '4', 'sweep', 'Showtime', 'Lakers', '83', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'games', 'am', 'not', 'Sixers', 'fan', 'still', 'love', 'watching', 'Dr', 'J', 'Sixers', 'performing', 'highest', 'Funny', 'how', 'player', 'would', 'give', 'opposing', 'player', 'hand', 'pick', 'up', 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'started', 'watching', 'NBA', 'early', ""90's.The"", '1990', 'Semifinal', 'game', '3', 'Bull', 'Sixers', 'was', 'cable', 'channel', 'called', 'Prism', 'Philly', 'were', 'days', 'when', 'player', 'support', 'shorts', 'would', 'show', 'underneath', 'regular', 'team', 'shorts', 'Disc', '5', 'game', '1', 'A.I', 'Sixers', 'Kobe/Shaq', 'Lakers', 'Then', 'finally', 'Disc', '6', 'Allen', 'Iverson', 'Answer', 'Again', 'lots', 'Pat', 'Croche', 'this.Very', 'nice', 'set', 'fans', '76ers', 'fans', 'NBA', 'history', 'general', 'highlight', 'set', 'was', 'watching', 'Julius', 'Erving', 'finally', 'win', 'long', 'awaited', 'championship', 'do', 'get', 'lot', 'Allen', 'Iverson', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'will', 'seem', 'dated', 'Iverson', 'was', 'still', 'protrayed', 'Philly', 'Answer', 'Still', 'get', 'set', 'relive', 'Dr', 'J', 'best']",NBA Dynasty Series - Philadelphia 76ers - The Complete History

It has all of the history of the franchise going back to the 1940s teams. It has the wilt chamberlin Billy Cunningham era, to the 9-73 76ers, to the arrival of Dr.J and the whole dunking guys like daryl dawkins and moses malone and them to there finals apperance and victory in 1983. To the fall of that team and rise of Charles Barkely, to the trade of him. Then to the era of Iverson. It has the games when they swpt LA in game 4, and the 7th game vs Boston in 1983, then the series when they lost to Chicago and that one game they won in Philadelphia in the 1990 confrence semi-finals, then my favroite the game when Iverson stepped over lue in game one of the 2001 NBA Finals. The only con to this is that they should have games from the 1983 season and 2001 like that game 2 vs Indiana game 2 vs Toronto game 5 vs Toronto game 7 vs Toronto game 7 vs Milwakee and the seasonal game when they beat Sacramento on TNT in feburary of 2001.

891889,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0007VY47M,Cubist,"[18, 21]","The Philadelphia 76ers are one of the original NBA teams and, as this box set so amply illustrates, have had an impressive roster of players through their legacy, from when they were known as the Warriors, up to the present with Allen Iverson. Several documentaries and featurettes explore various aspects of the team's legacy, its triumphs and star players.There is a treasure trove of vintage footage of players like Wilt Chamberlain and Dr. J in action. Also covered are the classic, individual rivalries, like Chamberlain vs. Boston Celtics' Bill Russell (who jokes, ""I never could stop him. But I could put up some speed bumps. That's the best I could come up with.""), and franchise ones, like the long-standing grudge matches between the Celtics and the Lakers. Back in the day, these teams played tough, grueling matches with heartbreaking defeats and exhilarating wins on both sides.Also included are brief looks at key seasons in the team's history, such as the 1966-67 season when they defeated the Celtics and the 1982-83 season when they won the championship. There are also mini-profiles of some of their legendary alumni, like Dr. J and his simply breathtaking style of play. Some of the shots he made seemingly defied the odds (and gravity).Fans of the Sixers will not be disappointed by this box set. It features a nice mix of team history and vintage games that will have one waxing nostalgic for the glory days when the team was one of the greatest in the NBA.The ""1982 Eastern Conference Finals, Game 7"" allows one to watch, in its entirety, the exciting game where the Sixers defeated the Celtics in Boston to go onto the NBA finals.The ""1983 NBA Finals, Game 4"" is a very exciting and highly emotional game where Dr. J and the Sixers swept the Lakers to win the championship in one of the all-time great match-ups.The ""1990 Eastern Conference Semifinals, Game 3"" sees Barkley score an impressive 34 points to help his team defeat the Chicago Bulls.A.I. tops Barkley in the ""2001 NBA Finals, Game 1"" when he scores an astounding 48 points to hand Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers an upset in overtime.Finally, as an added bonus is the already released Iverson DVD entitled, ""The Answer.""",4,Back in the day...,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,2206,"['Philadelphia', '76ers', 'are', 'one', 'original', 'NBA', 'teams', 'box', 'set', 'so', 'amply', 'illustrates', 'have', 'had', 'impressive', 'roster', 'players', 'legacy', 'when', 'were', 'known', 'Warriors', 'up', 'present', 'Allen', 'Iverson', 'Several', 'documentaries', 'featurettes', 'explore', 'various', 'aspects', 'team', 'legacy', 'triumphs', 'star', 'players.There', 'treasure', 'trove', 'vintage', 'footage', 'players', 'Wilt', 'Chamberlain', 'Dr.', 'J', 'action', 'Also', 'covered', 'are', 'classic', 'individual', 'rivalries', 'Chamberlain', 'Boston', 'Celtics', 'Bill', 'Russell', 'who', 'never', 'could', 'stop', 'could', 'put', 'up', 'speed', 'bumps', 'best', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'franchise', 'ones', 'long-standing', 'grudge', 'matches', 'Celtics', 'Lakers', 'Back', 'day', 'teams', 'played', 'tough', 'grueling', 'matches', 'heartbreaking', 'defeats', 'exhilarating', 'wins', 'sides.Also', 'included', 'are', 'brief', 'looks', 'key', 'seasons', 'team', 'history', 'such', '1966-67', 'season', 'when', 'defeated', 'Celtics', '1982-83', 'season', 'when', 'won', 'championship', 'are', 'also', 'mini-profiles', 'legendary', 'alumni', 'Dr.', 'J', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'style', 'play', 'shots', 'made', 'seemingly', 'defied', 'odds', 'gravity', '.Fans', 'Sixers', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'box', 'set', 'nice', 'mix', 'team', 'history', 'vintage', 'games', 'will', 'have', 'one', 'waxing', 'nostalgic', 'glory', 'days', 'when', 'team', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'NBA.The', '1982', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'Finals', 'Game', '7', 'one', 'watch', 'entirety', 'exciting', 'game', 'where', 'Sixers', 'defeated', 'Celtics', 'Boston', 'go', 'NBA', 'finals.The', '1983', 'NBA', 'Finals', 'Game', '4', 'very', 'exciting', 'highly', 'emotional', 'game', 'where', 'Dr.', 'J', 'Sixers', 'swept', 'Lakers', 'win', 'championship', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'match-ups.The', '1990', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'Semifinals', 'Game', '3', 'sees', 'Barkley', 'score', 'impressive', '34', 'points', 'help', 'team', 'defeat', 'Chicago', 'Bulls.A.I', 'tops', 'Barkley', '2001', 'NBA', 'Finals', 'Game', '1', 'when', 'astounding', '48', 'points', 'hand', 'Shaquille', ""O'Neal"", 'Lakers', 'upset', 'overtime.Finally', 'added', 'bonus', 'already', 'released', 'Iverson', 'DVD', 'entitled', 'Answer']",NBA Dynasty Series - Philadelphia 76ers - The Complete History

The one thing, however, that I truly loathe is the lack of content they have on Wilt Chamberlain.

The history of the team was informative and thorough, and the entire championship-winning game vs. the Lakers was well worth the cost of the entire set alone.  An added bonus of that game was the commentating of Bill Russell as more often than not the listener/viewer had no clue what he was talking about!  He'd babble something totally irrelevant to the game that it's no wonder he ""retired"" from commentating NBA games.  But what SHOULD have been included in this boxed set was the 76ers' prior-season loss of the championship against Los Angeles and, of course, Philadelphia's road TO the championship such as the games of the Eastern Conference finals.  Also, to include so much footage of Allen Iverson was a HUGE mistake as no championships were ever won with him on the team. If you're going to include so much of Iverson, do likewise with Dr. J (who won one championship) and Charles Barkley (who also never won a ring but was a great player).  All in all, I can honestly say that about three of the five disks were of totally uninteresting games and useless footage, which is really a shame because over the lifetime span of the 76ers, there have been some awesome players who should have been either included or properly featured.",3,"History of the 76ers, Non-Winners Included",1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,1347,"['diehard', 'fan', '76ers', '1980', 'Moses', 'Malone', 'general', 'just', 'had', 'have', 'DVD', 'history', 'team', 'was', 'informative', 'thorough', 'entire', 'championship-winning', 'game', 'Lakers', 'was', 'well', 'cost', 'entire', 'set', 'alone', 'added', 'bonus', 'game', 'was', 'commentating', 'Bill', 'Russell', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'listener/viewer', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'about', ""'d"", 'babble', 'something', 'totally', 'irrelevant', 'game', 'wonder', 'retired', 'commentating', 'NBA', 'games', 'what', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'boxed', 'set', 'was', '76ers', 'prior-season', 'loss', 'championship', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'course', 'Philadelphia', 'road', 'TO', 'championship', 'such', 'games', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'finals', 'Also', 'include', 'so', 'much', 'footage', 'Allen', 'Iverson', 'was', 'HUGE', 'mistake', 'championships', 'were', 'ever', 'won', 'team', ""'re"", 'going', 'include', 'so', 'much', 'Iverson', 'do', 'likewise', 'Dr.', 'J', 'who', 'won', 'one', 'championship', 'Charles', 'Barkley', 'who', 'also', 'never', 'won', 'ring', 'was', 'great', 'player', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'about', 'three', 'five', 'disks', 'were', 'totally', 'uninteresting', 'games', 'useless', 'footage', 'really', 'shame', 'lifetime', 'span', '76ers', 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'players', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'properly', 'featured']",NBA Dynasty Series - Philadelphia 76ers - The Complete History
