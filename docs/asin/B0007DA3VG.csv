While her adventures and exploits may range from the exhilarating to the absurd and the acting most of the time way over-the-top somehow, believe it or not, it was always tons of fun and the cast of characters where played to perfection by everyone involved.Here it is, all six seasons of `Xena: Warrior Princess' just within your reach. Yes you could by a season or two separately but what would be the point? This is an evolving saga that has to be viewed in its entirety to be fully understood and appreciated. The action is fast and furious, the drama dark and foreboding, the comedy slapstick and the cast exceptional. There isn't a household on Olympus that doesn't own the complete set, shouldn't you?Postscript: Thanks for the memories Lucy and Renee, I mean Xena and Gabrielle!

880368,A2M0Y868LHDVR5,B0007DA3VG,Dan Carver,"[28, 58]","I Love Xena, she is one of the most interesting Characters ever on Television, and Lucy Lawless does a fantastic job playing her. One Day, I will own the entire series on DVD. But until then, I bought this collection, to tide me over. I LOVE the box and case designing of the collection, it looks great with the rest of my DVD's.. But as far as Xena Essentials, this just won't do. Granted this collection it is not meant to be the entire series on DVD, but they could have done alot better with the Episode Selection. These are the episodes contained in the set:ACTUAL EPISODE LIST:Sins of the Past (Series Premiere Episode)CallistoIs There A Doctor In The House?Been There, Done ThatThe Bitter SuiteOne Against An ArmyThe Ides of MarchFallen AngelLyre, Lyre, Hearts On FireAmphipolis Under SiegeMotherhoodOld Ares Had a FarmWhen Fates CollideMany Happy ReturnsA Friend In Need (1 & 2) (Series Finale)Now, Some of those are Great Epsidoes, some of those really are Essential.. other's we can live without, we could also use a few more. I wouldn't mind paying $75 or $80 for a collection with a few more episodes that were really essential. I mean, seaons 2 and 4 are almost completely ignored leaving out essential storylines including HOPE, CALLISTO, and CAESAR. (None of those are completely left out as it is, but we don't get enough of any of them). Now, if I were in charge of this, which I'm not.. but if I were, this is how I would do it:MY IDEAL EPISODE LIST:Sins of the Past (Series Premiere EpisodeA Royal Couple of Theives *CallistoReturn of Callisto *Destiny *The Quest *A Necissary Evil *Comedy of Eros *Been There, Done ThatThe Deliverer *Gabrielle's Hope *The Debt (1 & 2) *Maternal Instincts *The Bitter SuiteThe Sacrifice (1 & 2) *Family Affair *Between the Lines *The Ides of MarchFallen AngelLyre, Lyre, Hearts On FireGod Fearing Child *Amphipolis Under SiegeMotherhoodOld Ares Had a FarmWhen Fates CollideThe God You Know *You Are There *A Friend In Need (1 & 2) (Series Finale)* Episode Additions or Replacements Suggested by Me for any future Xena DVD collectionsREMOVED: ""s There a Doctor In the House,"" ""A Day in The Life,"" ""One Against and Army,"" and ""Many Happy Returns"" which are some of the weaker connecting episodes in the series. ""A Day in the Life"" is probably my least favorite Episode in the entire XENA Series. ""One Against an Army"" is hard to take out of an essentials collection, but has to be taken out to make room for more ""essential"" episodes...I realize that 30 episodes, opposed to 16.. might be a bit excessive. But it is a better collection for it. When an artist releases an album, generally there are 10-14, sometimes 15 tracks on the album. When that same artist releases a greatest hits collection, there are 15-18 tracks, minnimum, and possibly even two discs, sometimes there's even a supplemental remix disc. A Series, like Xena has about 22-26 episodes per season... It's not unforseeable to release a ""Greatest Hits of Xena"" with about 30 episodes.Personally I wish more thought and preparation had gone into this collection than it did",2,I Wish More Thought Had Gone Into Episode Selection.,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,3091,"['Love', 'Xena', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'Characters', 'ever', 'Television', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'One', 'Day', 'will', 'own', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'then', 'bought', 'collection', 'tide', 'LOVE', 'box', 'case', 'designing', 'collection', 'great', 'rest', ""DVD's.."", 'as', 'far', 'Xena', 'Essentials', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'Granted', 'collection', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'alot', 'better', 'Episode', 'Selection', 'are', 'episodes', 'contained', 'set', 'ACTUAL', 'EPISODE', 'LIST', 'Sins', 'Past', 'Series', 'Premiere', 'Episode', 'CallistoIs', 'A', 'Doctor', 'House', 'Been', 'Done', 'ThatThe', 'Bitter', 'SuiteOne', 'Against', 'ArmyThe', 'Ides', 'MarchFallen', 'AngelLyre', 'Lyre', 'Hearts', 'FireAmphipolis', 'SiegeMotherhoodOld', 'Ares', 'Had', 'FarmWhen', 'Fates', 'CollideMany', 'Happy', 'ReturnsA', 'Friend', 'Need', '1', '2', 'Series', 'Finale', 'Now', 'are', 'Great', 'Epsidoes', 'really', 'are', 'Essential..', 'other', 'can', 'live', 'could', 'also', 'use', 'few', 'more', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'paying', '75', '80', 'collection', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'were', 'really', 'essential', 'mean', 'seaons', '2', '4', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'ignored', 'leaving', 'out', 'essential', 'storylines', 'including', 'HOPE', 'CALLISTO', 'CAESAR', 'None', 'are', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Now', 'were', 'charge', ""'m"", 'not..', 'were', 'how', 'would', 'do', 'MY', 'IDEAL', 'EPISODE', 'LIST', 'Sins', 'Past', 'Series', 'Premiere', 'EpisodeA', 'Royal', 'Couple', 'Theives', '*CallistoReturn', 'Callisto', '*Destiny', '*The', 'Quest', '*A', 'Necissary', 'Evil', '*Comedy', 'Eros', '*Been', 'Done', 'ThatThe', 'Deliverer', '*Gabrielle', 'Hope', '*The', 'Debt', '1', '2', '*Maternal', 'Instincts', '*The', 'Bitter', 'SuiteThe', 'Sacrifice', '1', '2', '*Family', 'Affair', '*Between', 'Lines', '*The', 'Ides', 'MarchFallen', 'AngelLyre', 'Lyre', 'Hearts', 'FireGod', 'Fearing', 'Child', '*Amphipolis', 'SiegeMotherhoodOld', 'Ares', 'Had', 'FarmWhen', 'Fates', 'CollideThe', 'God', 'Know', 'Are', '*A', 'Friend', 'Need', '1', '2', 'Series', 'Finale', '*', 'Episode', 'Additions', 'Replacements', 'Suggested', 'Me', 'future', 'Xena', 'DVD', 'collectionsREMOVED', 's', 'Doctor', 'House', 'Day', 'Life', 'One', 'Against', 'Army', 'Many', 'Happy', 'Returns', 'are', 'weaker', 'connecting', 'episodes', 'series', 'Day', 'Life', 'probably', 'least', 'favorite', 'Episode', 'entire', 'XENA', 'Series', 'One', 'Against', 'Army', 'hard', 'take', 'out', 'essentials', 'collection', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'make', 'room', 'more', 'essential', 'episodes', 'realize', '30', 'episodes', 'opposed', '16..', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'excessive', 'better', 'collection', 'When', 'artist', 'album', 'generally', 'are', '10-14', 'sometimes', '15', 'tracks', 'album', 'When', 'same', 'artist', 'greatest', 'hits', 'collection', 'are', '15-18', 'tracks', 'minnimum', 'possibly', 'even', 'two', 'discs', 'sometimes', 'even', 'supplemental', 'remix', 'disc', 'Series', 'Xena', '22-26', 'episodes', 'season', 'not', 'unforseeable', 'release', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'Xena', '30', 'episodes.Personally', 'wish', 'more', 'thought', 'preparation', 'had', 'gone', 'collection', 'did']",Xena: Warrior Princess The Complete Series (Seasons 1-6 Bundle)
880369,ABZQ3E2G1UWJT,B0007DA3VG,"David E. Miller ""LividEmerald""","[52, 67]","This 10th Anniversary Collection is very well packaged. I do wish it had a few more episodes, but some of my favorites are included (""A Day in the Life,"" ""Been There, Done That,"" ""The Bitter Suite,"" ""The Ides of March""). The one episode I didn't particularly care to see included was ""Is There a Doctor in the House?"" but I guess fans liked the ""Gabrielle is mortally wounded"" aspect (similar to her plight in ""One Against an Army""), or else the ""female relationship"" angle. Although I hated the series finale (""A Friend in Need"") at the time it aired, and have been quite bitter about it for years now, viewing the finale again has tempered my feelings considerably. There is a certain undeniable logic that justifies Xena's mortal end, and her brutal demise is softened by the visual presence of her spirit. I must say, I truly appreciate the theatrical quality of the seamless director's cut, and there are a couple of graphic scenes included in this version that did not air on television which definitely enhances the episode's tragic impact.... As for the interviews and featurettes, I really enjoyed most of them. But I simply could not sit through the Robert Trebor piece, first of all because I never cared for the Salmonius character, and second of all because the actor is just too full of himself. Everyone else is delightful, though. I cringed here and there during the Xena Convention piece, didn't care for the Xena reenactments, and absolutely loathed the ""Xena Fanatic"" video. I am a true fan of Xena, but I'm definitely NOT a fanatic. As William Shatner once opined, fanatics need to get a life.... Also, I'm a heterosexual male, and the convention footage and fanatic videos clearly focus on gay fans. I have nothing against this sector of our society, but I do feel that guys like me who found Xena kick-butt sexy should have found a voice in the featurettes somewhere. At any rate, I rarely watch the extras more than once.

I liked Xena more then i liked Hercules at the time, because even though that show was also very good, Xena i thought had the better direction out of those 2 shows. Lucy Lawless was so great on portraying Xena, not only beautiful but a really good actress. Same for Renee O' Connor who plays Gabrielle. Ted Raimi, i thought this was his funniest role, playing Joxer, trying to be a warrior, ends up getting his butt kicked everytime.This show was just so creative, not only in its stories but in its action scenes. Loved the music to the Xena shows, all the amazing scores and the song in the opening credits, it sounds so amazing. I liked this DVD set because i never got the chance to see the last episode of this amazing series. I was amazed by the last episode, the directors cut, i'm guessing a lot of scenes were too violent for TV, which is kind of obvious, the darts looked so painful. Some of the stories, actually make you feel sympathetic towards the characters when they are in danger and on television shows that is a rare thing, usually it only happens in the movies, i find that quite amazing.Kind of hard to believe this show has been gone since 2001, i think this DVD will make fans of the show very happy, the audio/video commentary, the fan convention where fans tell us what their favorite episodes were. This show had something that i feel no other show can copy, i think we see too many reality shows now.

I can honestly say that the New Zealand locations these series were filmed at bear little resemblance to ancient or modern Greece.Both series were absolutely great!  Watched them every day and got absorbed into the characters, so much so that when the end came I could not believe they ended the series like that.  I have no problem with reality but it felt real to me and I'm still very angry with the way Xena was killed/murdered/butchered at the end.The next time I watch this series I'll have to end it with the next to last episode because this was one of the few TV shows my wife and I both watched together and liked unfortunately we never saw them all together because of our schedules.  She died last year and it's taken me a long time to come to grips with her death and watching Xena's final mortal moments isn't something I care to ever watch again since her character was one my wife and I both enjoyed.Except for the last episode the rest of the series is five stars.",5,Better Late than Never,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,1739,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'rundown', 'obvious', 'facts', 'trivia', 'been', 'done', ""'m"", 'just', 'sharing', 'unique', 'experience', 'opinion.I', 'was', 'deployment', 'Navy', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'episodes', 'first', 'time', 'back', '2000', 'unfortunately', 'due', 'deployments', 'work', 'schedules', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'more', 'very', 'small', 'handful', 'episodes.I', 'ordered', 'complete', 'series', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'again', 'due', 'deployment', 'schedules', 'merchant', 'marine', 'now', 'work', 'schedule', 'basically', 'stayed', 'box', 'recently.I', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'entire', 'series', 'including', 'Hercules', 'deployment', 'Mediterranean', 'Sea', 'Greek', 'islands', 'mostly', 'Crete', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'make', 'claim', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'New', 'Zealand', 'series', 'were', 'filmed', 'bear', 'little', 'resemblance', 'ancient', 'modern', 'Greece.Both', 'series', 'were', 'absolutely', 'great', 'Watched', 'day', 'got', 'absorbed', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'end', 'came', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'ended', 'series', 'have', 'problem', 'reality', 'felt', 'real', ""'m"", 'still', 'very', 'angry', 'way', 'Xena', 'was', 'killed/murdered/butchered', 'end.The', 'next', 'time', 'watch', 'series', ""'ll"", 'have', 'end', 'next', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'TV', 'shows', 'wife', 'watched', 'together', 'liked', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'saw', 'together', 'schedules', 'died', 'last', 'year', 'taken', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'grips', 'death', 'watching', 'Xena', 'final', 'mortal', 'moments', ""n't"", 'something', 'care', 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'wife', 'enjoyed.Except', 'last', 'episode', 'rest', 'series', 'five', 'stars']",Xena: Warrior Princess The Complete Series (Seasons 1-6 Bundle)

It's great action, at times heartfelt or hilarious or risque.  Christians might be offended by the not so subtle references to biblical stories (i.e. ""immaculate"" conception of Xena's baby.)

That is despite the season 1 collection.  It's got poor special features and weak video quality that's very obvious on the HDTV.  I've seen better quality VHS recordings.Season 2 has the same weak video quality but a few features like occasional commentary and interviews.  During the commentary, Bob Tapert's the serious one and Lucy Lawless is laughing at herself like Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Certainly interesting to hear her without the American accent.  They introduced the concept of Video Commentary, where they show the actors or crew reacting to the episode as they're watching it.  You can't watch that instead of an episode (the video commentary is not on the complete episode) but there is some value added to see their reactions.Season 3 is when the video quality got much better and the features excellent.

The show, for a while, ran in syndication, and after a few years hiatus is now back on tv. It was its return to tv that prompted me to buy this set. I had forgotten how much I loved to watch Xena and Gabrielle's adventures. These episodes are great, and I've noticed that some of what we see here is not what aired on tv, guess the FCC had something to say about it. It also saves you money if you want the director's cut of Friend in Need, as its included in this boxed set. Granted there are other episodes I would have chosen, but until I get the seasons this will work for me just fine. Great buy, and any Xena fan would want it for their collection.Just wanted to mention, one thing I also love are the black and white pictures on the inside glossy dvd covers. The show's greatest moments are actually compiled on six discs, with the seventh being nothing but extras. The commentary is also wonderful, as its nice to see Lucy [Lawless] and Renee [O'Connor] laughing and enjoying the show just as much,if not more than, as the fans.",5,Xena in all her glory!,1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,1112,"['was', 'junior', 'highschool', 'when', 'Xena', 'final', 'episode', 'aired', 'television', 'show', 'while', 'ran', 'syndication', 'few', 'years', 'hiatus', 'now', 'back', 'tv', 'was', 'return', 'tv', 'prompted', 'buy', 'set', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'watch', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle', 'adventures', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'not', 'what', 'aired', 'tv', 'guess', 'FCC', 'had', 'something', 'say', 'also', 'money', 'want', 'director', 'cut', 'Friend', 'Need', 'included', 'boxed', 'set', 'Granted', 'are', 'other', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'get', 'seasons', 'will', 'work', 'just', 'fine', 'Great', 'buy', 'Xena', 'fan', 'would', 'want', 'collection.Just', 'wanted', 'mention', 'one', 'thing', 'also', 'love', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'pictures', 'inside', 'glossy', 'dvd', 'covers', 'show', 'greatest', 'moments', 'are', 'actually', 'compiled', 'six', 'discs', 'seventh', 'being', 'nothing', 'extras', 'commentary', 'also', 'wonderful', 'nice', 'see', 'Lucy', '[', 'Lawless', ']', 'Renee', '[', ""O'Connor"", ']', 'laughing', 'enjoying', 'show', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'fans']",Xena: Warrior Princess The Complete Series (Seasons 1-6 Bundle)
