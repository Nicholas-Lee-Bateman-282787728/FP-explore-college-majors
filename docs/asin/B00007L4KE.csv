An obvioulsy low-budget film, the acting was so absurd and it was almost funny!  However, the plot is what saved the film, and for that I give it a 4 star rating.  I often wonder, however, how this book-based movie would have turned out with quality acting.  Her other movies, (While My Pretty One Sleeps, Let Me Call You Sweetheart, and Remember Me) were done beautifully and I would recommend highly to any Mary Higgins Clark fan!",4,"Loves the Book, Laughs at the Movie!",1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,603,"['die-hard', 'Mary', 'Higgins', 'Clark', 'fan', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'even', 'had', 'pleasure', 'meeting', 'book-signing', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'obvioulsy', 'low-budget', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'absurd', 'was', 'almost', 'funny', 'However', 'plot', 'what', 'saved', 'film', 'give', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'often', 'wonder', 'however', 'how', 'book-based', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'quality', 'acting', 'other', 'movies', 'My', 'Pretty', 'One', 'Sleeps', 'Let', 'Me', 'Call', 'Sweetheart', 'Remember', 'Me', 'were', 'done', 'beautifully', 'would', 'recommend', 'highly', 'Mary', 'Higgins', 'Clark', 'fan']",N/A

730898,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00007L4KE,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Adaptations of Mary Higgins Clark's books range from the cheesy to the chilling, and sadly the adaptation of ""Loves Music, Loves to Dance"" is closer to the ""cheesy"" end of the spectrum. There's a good mystery buried somewhere in this, but the murderer is hilariously over-the-top and doll-faced Patsy Kensit just flails around ineffectually with her mouth open.TV producer Darcy Scott (Kensit) persuades her buddy Erin to help her with a TV special on people who put out romantic personal ads. But then Erin is found murdered, with a heeled dancing shoe on one foot -- and the guilt-wracked Darcy is determined to figure out who killed her buddy. The police detective (Frank Pellegrino) assigned to the case thinks this is just one of a string of similar deaths.But Darcy is determined to help nab the killer herself, so she starts going on dates with the various creepy weirdos that Erin vetted... and she thinks she's got the killer when she encounters one creep who seems to have rage issues. Of course it isn't that easy, particularly since serial killers aren't really about the spontaneous bursts of rage.""Loves Music, Loves to Dance"" is a wonderfully creepy book, even if it's one of Mary Higgins Clark's weaker mysteries. Too bad you won't find any of that in this TV adaptation -- when it's not tedious enough to make your eyes bleed, it's hilariously silly enough to make you kick your dancing shoes on the floor. The worst part is, it's not trying to be either.Most of the plot oozes by with some red herrings and the occasional clue, and the police investigations are overshadowed by Darcy bumbling around on dates with dangerous, creepy men. If those dates weren't enough to make you want to tear your eyes out, then I direct you to any scenes with the killer in ""creepy mode."" It's bad enough when he's slow-dancing with corpses, but then he swoops around in a wig and makes all sorts of dramatic statements like ""... maybe we'll SHARE A DANCE.""The most unforgivable aspect of the story: Darcy is completely superfluous. Unnecessary. Unneeded. She contributes absolutely nothing to the investigation that eventually figures out the killer, and the police manage to figure it out without her. She actually HAMPERED their investigation by her efforts, rather than helping it.As if Darcy weren't enough of an annoyance, Patsy Kensit plays her as a fluttery wide-eyed blonde who doesn't have the faintest idea what she's doing, and can only solve the mystery because the murderer slipped up. Pellegrino does a remarkably good job as an iron-fisted cop who inexplicably seems to find this dunce attractive, and who actually has good detecting skills. And Yannick Bisson looks vaguely embarrassed to be there.""Mary Higgins Clark's Loves Music, Loves To Dance"" won't exactly make you dance... more like crawl behind the sofa. Bad acting, a limp plot and wretchedly cheesy direction all combine.",1,"Don't quite love music, can't quite love dancing",1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,2901,"['Adaptations', 'Mary', 'Higgins', 'Clark', 'books', 'range', 'cheesy', 'chilling', 'sadly', 'adaptation', 'Loves', 'Music', 'Dance', 'closer', 'cheesy', 'end', 'spectrum', 'good', 'mystery', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'murderer', 'hilariously', 'over-the-top', 'doll-faced', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'just', 'around', 'ineffectually', 'mouth', 'open.TV', 'producer', 'Darcy', 'Scott', 'Kensit', 'buddy', 'Erin', 'help', 'TV', 'special', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'out', 'romantic', 'personal', 'ads', 'then', 'Erin', 'found', 'murdered', 'heeled', 'dancing', 'shoe', 'one', 'foot', 'guilt-wracked', 'Darcy', 'determined', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'buddy', 'police', 'detective', 'Frank', 'Pellegrino', 'assigned', 'case', 'just', 'one', 'string', 'similar', 'deaths.But', 'Darcy', 'determined', 'help', 'nab', 'killer', 'going', 'dates', 'various', 'creepy', 'weirdos', 'Erin', 'vetted', 'got', 'killer', 'when', 'one', 'creep', 'who', 'have', 'rage', 'issues', 'course', ""n't"", 'easy', 'particularly', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'spontaneous', 'bursts', 'rage', 'Loves', 'Music', 'Dance', 'wonderfully', 'creepy', 'book', 'even', 'one', 'Mary', 'Higgins', 'Clark', 'weaker', 'mysteries', 'Too', 'bad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'when', 'not', 'tedious', 'enough', 'make', 'eyes', 'bleed', 'hilariously', 'silly', 'enough', 'make', 'kick', 'dancing', 'shoes', 'floor', 'worst', 'part', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'either.Most', 'plot', 'oozes', 'red', 'herrings', 'occasional', 'clue', 'police', 'investigations', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'Darcy', 'bumbling', 'around', 'dates', 'dangerous', 'creepy', 'men', 'dates', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'tear', 'eyes', 'out', 'then', 'direct', 'scenes', 'killer', 'creepy', 'mode', 'bad', 'enough', 'when', 'slow-dancing', 'corpses', 'then', 'around', 'wig', 'sorts', 'dramatic', 'statements', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'SHARE', 'DANCE', 'most', 'unforgivable', 'aspect', 'story', 'Darcy', 'completely', 'superfluous', 'Unnecessary', 'Unneeded', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'investigation', 'eventually', 'out', 'killer', 'police', 'manage', 'figure', 'out', 'actually', 'HAMPERED', 'investigation', 'efforts', 'rather', 'helping', 'it.As', 'Darcy', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'annoyance', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'fluttery', 'wide-eyed', 'blonde', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'faintest', 'idea', 'what', 'doing', 'can', 'only', 'solve', 'mystery', 'murderer', 'slipped', 'up', 'Pellegrino', 'remarkably', 'good', 'job', 'iron-fisted', 'cop', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'find', 'dunce', 'attractive', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'detecting', 'skills', 'Yannick', 'Bisson', 'vaguely', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'there', 'Mary', 'Higgins', 'Clark', 'Loves', 'Music', 'Dance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'make', 'dance', 'more', 'crawl', 'sofa', 'Bad', 'acting', 'limp', 'plot', 'wretchedly', 'cheesy', 'direction', 'combine']",N/A

He is suspected then to have killed seven women and the bodies disappeared and apparently the profiling of the murders that all had some important common points did not bring them together and attract the attention of the police. Then the story is well executed and designed and the final identity of the killer is not a total surprise but it is quite logically introduced in the film, the way he is introduced from the very start. But of course that kind of antagonistic presentation of the killer as the most innocent person possible, actually friendly and helpful, is nave because it has been used hundreds of times.

Mary Higgins Clarke, America's Queen of Suspense, has crafted a terrific tale of murder, full of twists and turns which lead to  an edge-of-the-seat and surprisingly non-violent finale.While the low budget does hurt the film (the stock footage of NY is painfully horrible), and Patsy Kensit tends to overact quite a bit, the real winner here is the story, a twisted tale which takes a stab at the dangerous side of the world of online dating. The film does get cheesy at parts, especially when we see the 'killer' alone in his studio, talking to himself and dancing with the corpses of the women he has killed. These scenes could have been handled a lot more maturely and have had a creepy feel to them had they been done right, but it comes across as B-movie bad in this.
