The Cage was an excellent telefilm, needing no enveloping really, but the producers obviously felt otherwise.  The enveloping story is full of plot holes and, quite plainly, not very good.  Spock acts illogically and irrationally for a reason that just doesn't cut it (surely he could have found another way to help his Captain without mutiny).  This is a bad episode.

207738,AO37T54VEP0JQ,630021320X,"B.C. Scribe ""trekviewer""","[1, 2]","On September 8, 1966 Star Trek premiered on NBC to little critical acclaim.  In the weeks that followed Star Trek's audience of ardent fans was treated to shows unlike anything else they had seen on television.  Over the course of the evenings of both November 17 and November 24 of that same year Star Trek aired an episode titled 'The Menagerie' and science fiction on television came of age - and, more importantly, people noticed.  The episode has become legendary over these past many years, some Trekkies considering it the best show in the whole of the Star Trek canon.  While that point may be arguable it is no question that 'The Menagerie' helped put the series over the top.  Nearly every one of us fans knows the story of this episode: in 1965 the NBC network approved the series for production but rejected the series pilot titled 'The Cage'; that footage was then used as a ""wrap-around"" story for 'The Menagerie' detailing the extraordinary experiences of the crew of the Enterprise, and in particular Captain Pike, on Talos IV.  The story itself is quite good but it's the use of the footage of the failed pilot that makes this episode so brilliant.While enroute to deliver much needed medical supplies to the distant Vegan colony the Enterprise intercepts an old style earth radio transmission.  The signal is determined to be sent by a Starfleet vessel and originating from a nearby star system; further the Enterprise's science officers discover that the signal had been sent over 17 years earlier, when the vessel was first listed as missing.  When it's confirmed there are survivors the Enterprise travels there to rescue them.  Very soon upon their arrival the landing party makes some mysterious discoveries about the survivors - including an alluring and seductive beauty named Vina. The captain is taken captive and held in an underground cavern by the planet's inhabitants, the Talosians, where he is forced against his will to live through illusion after another.  The crew members try to rescue the captain but continually fail; two female members of the bridge crew are taken hostage when the Enterprise attempts to beam a landing party inside the caverns.  The Talosians are attempting to entice the earthlings into propagation in order to reproduce a new race of beings to repopulate the planet which once thrived.  When the Talosians realize that humans will not be contented to be caged they relent and allow the Enterprise and its crew to leave.  Vina however, who was the only human survivor of a scientific expedition that crash-landed on Talos IV seventeen years earlier, harbors a secret that leaves her with little choice but to stay.That was the story in the original pilot aptly titled 'The Cage'.  In 'The Menagerie' Spock both shanghais his former commander, Captain Pike, from Starbase 11 and commandeers the Enterprise through a series of masterful maneuvers.  Pike is now a virtual invalid having been paralyzed and horribly disfigured in an accident.  When Spock takes his charade as far as he can he turns himself over for judicial punishment but does not relinquish his control over the Enterprise - which is now being controlled by computers and set on a course for Talos IV.  Contact with the planet is forbidden by the Federation and violation of the directive is punishable by death.  A court martial is convened to determine Spock's culpability and what his reasons are for taking such an incredible risk.  During the trial Spock refuses to divulge his reasons and instead the officials arbitrating the court martial are fed images from Talos IV that picture what happened on the Enterprise's visit there 13 years ago.  The mystery of what happened to them there is revealed onscreen and the reasons for Spock's actions become clear and the intrepid first officer escapes judicial punishment.Even after all these many years and several Star Trek incarnations this episode continues to hold it's own among the very best shows Trek has produced.  And what might be seen as dated production elements are actually still quite impressive when seen today.  In particular the matte painting in the background of the opening sequence where Kirk, Spock and McCoy are greeted by Miss Piper is among the very best produced for the original series; the matte painting of the fortress on Rigel VII is another memorable shot.  I also liked the fact that the survivors the Enterprise encounters on Talos IV were wearing tattered remnants of clothing and that the camp was a sort of slap-dash and hodge-podge of pieces from wreckage - the wreckage of a starship they detected from their scanners on the Enterprise.  Too often the production department opted to use props that looked entirely too new and clean for scenes in the original series when clearly that should not have been the case.The only knock I have against 'The Menagerie' is that the happy ending has one insurmountable shortcoming.  At the end of the episode Captain Pike joins Vina on the surface of Talos IV presumably to live out the rest of his life.  Since we discovered earlier in the show that Pike now has a battery driven heart let's hope the Enterprise left the Talosians with a prodigious supply of Duracells, Energizers or Everreadys!  Vina explained to Pike during the course of the episode that the Talosians had forgotten how to fix their machines in the centuries since they began living in the underground caverns.  And as evidenced at the conclusion of the show the top of the elevator shaft is still blown off, remaining in the same state of destruction the Enterprise had done to it 13 years earlier.  But of course now that the captain is able to speak and is mobile once again he can probably come up with a solution to that problem huh?  Let's hope so anyway!The court room sequences have one curiosity too that is a bit glaring.  All of the officers present for the trial are in full dress uniform with the exception of Mr. Scott who wears the familiar red long-sleeve shirt while he operates a computer that I presume is recording the events seen onscreen.  Speaking of Scotty he has only one line of dialogue during the show - if you can call it a line that is.  After Commodore Mendes and Kirk beam aboard the Enterprise a message is received in the transporter room to the effect that the computers aren't responding to commands or inputs.  Scotty grunts something unintelligible and walks out of the transporter room.  Apparently the writers couldn't spare one piece of dialogue for the ship's engineer; granted he isn't a peripheral character to the drama unfolding here but it's a shabby way to portray one of the staff officers of the flagship of the Federation.Worth noting: That is of course Majel Barrett seen playing Number One here who portrays Nurse Christine Chapel in subsequent episodes; John Hoyt, who plays Dr. Philip Boyce, is a familiar character actor and veteran of a few science fiction films of the 50's most notably in 'When World's Collide'; because Jeffrey Hunter had passed away it was decided to have his character depicted in the unrecognizable manner seen here and played by another actor; Mr. Spock acts very un-Vulcan like in the scenes on the planet's surface where he smiles a few times; this episode received a 1967 Hugo award as the best television screenplay (written by Gene Roddenberry).",5,Arguably the biggest milestone in Trek's storied history,1101859200,"12 1,

207740,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,630021320X,Brian Overland,"[0, 0]","""The Menagerie"" is a unique chapter in Trek history. Unable to deliver new episodes quickly enough (due to Trek's exceptionally long postproduction times in those days), the producers wrote a 2-part episode based largely around the original pilot for the show, which NBC had rejected. The newer scenes are mostly simple set-ups aboard ship or a starbase.The story-telling device is ingenious. Spock was the only crew member to carry over from the original cast. In Part I of ""The Menagerie,"" Spock hijacks the Enterprise to take his old captain, Christopher Pike, back to planet Talos IV. In the resulting mutiny trial, images are beamed from the planet. This footage is actually reused from the original Star Trek pilot, ""The Cage.""The resulting two-part story is an award-winning masterpiece. Roddenberry was fond of his original pilot and liked to show it by itself. But a great deal is gained by the framing device, or ""envelope."" (Note that there is little ""Cage"" footage that did not get reused in ""The Menagerie"" -- just a couple of brief scenes.) By seeing old and new Enterprise footage side by side, we get a sense of Federation history and continuity. There are some cosmetic changes, which would be natural, but it's basically the same ship. We see how deep the quality of loyalty is in Spock. Normally Spock's loyalty is to Kirk, but Spock's loyalty to his old captain -- also an Earthman -- in my opinion makes Spock all the more admirable.We also get to see Kirk and Pike side by side. These are similar men, both bold decisive leaders on the young side of 40. But Jefferey Hunter (whose other major role was Jesus) brought less of a sense of humor to Captain Pike than Shatner often did with Kirk.""The Cage"" itself, which makes up the bulk of Part II, is quite good. The big-brained Talosians captured Pike and sought to make him mate and settle down with an Earth woman, Vina (the delightful Susan Oliver). When they see that human hatred of captivity -- as demonstrated by Pike -- is too great, they realize that humans aren't useful to them and they let him go. Using the power of illusion, they offered many enticements. The scene in which they make Vina appear as a green Orion slave girl is the sexiest in all of Star Trek, and it's worth the money for that scene alone.The final scene (back on the current Enterprise) is one of the most moving in the history of the franchise. As the credits roll, we see Kirk gaze in awe as he sees the Talosians use their mental powers to restore the severely-disabled Pike to a full and joyful life. ""He has illusion and you have reality."" It is a very humane ending that helps to make up for the Talosians' earlier bad behavior.",5,Inadvertant Star Trek Masterpiece,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,2688,"['Menagerie', 'unique', 'chapter', 'Trek', 'history', 'Unable', 'deliver', 'new', 'episodes', 'quickly', 'enough', 'due', 'Trek', 'exceptionally', 'long', 'postproduction', 'times', 'days', 'producers', 'wrote', '2-part', 'episode', 'based', 'largely', 'original', 'pilot', 'show', 'NBC', 'had', 'rejected', 'newer', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'simple', 'set-ups', 'ship', 'starbase.The', 'story-telling', 'device', 'ingenious', 'Spock', 'was', 'only', 'crew', 'member', 'carry', 'original', 'cast', 'Part', 'Menagerie', 'Spock', 'Enterprise', 'take', 'old', 'captain', 'Christopher', 'Pike', 'back', 'planet', 'Talos', 'IV', 'resulting', 'mutiny', 'trial', 'images', 'are', 'beamed', 'planet', 'footage', 'actually', 'reused', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'pilot', 'Cage', 'resulting', 'two-part', 'story', 'award-winning', 'masterpiece', 'Roddenberry', 'was', 'fond', 'original', 'pilot', 'liked', 'show', 'great', 'deal', 'gained', 'framing', 'device', 'envelope', 'Note', 'little', 'Cage', 'footage', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'reused', 'Menagerie', 'just', 'couple', 'brief', 'scenes', 'seeing', 'old', 'new', 'Enterprise', 'footage', 'side', 'side', 'get', 'sense', 'Federation', 'history', 'continuity', 'are', 'cosmetic', 'changes', 'would', 'be', 'natural', 'basically', 'same', 'ship', 'see', 'how', 'deep', 'quality', 'loyalty', 'Spock', 'Normally', 'Spock', 'loyalty', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'loyalty', 'old', 'captain', 'also', 'Earthman', 'opinion', 'Spock', 'more', 'admirable.We', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Kirk', 'Pike', 'side', 'side', 'are', 'similar', 'men', 'bold', 'decisive', 'leaders', 'young', 'side', '40', 'Jefferey', 'Hunter', 'other', 'major', 'role', 'was', 'Jesus', 'brought', 'less', 'sense', 'humor', 'Captain', 'Pike', 'Shatner', 'often', 'did', 'Kirk', 'Cage', 'up', 'bulk', 'Part', 'II', 'quite', 'good', 'big-brained', 'Talosians', 'captured', 'Pike', 'sought', 'make', 'mate', 'settle', 'down', 'Earth', 'woman', 'Vina', 'delightful', 'Susan', 'Oliver', 'When', 'see', 'human', 'hatred', 'captivity', 'demonstrated', 'Pike', 'too', 'great', 'realize', 'humans', 'are', ""n't"", 'useful', 'let', 'go', 'Using', 'power', 'illusion', 'offered', 'many', 'enticements', 'scene', 'make', 'Vina', 'appear', 'green', 'Orion', 'slave', 'girl', 'sexiest', 'Star', 'Trek', 'money', 'scene', 'alone.The', 'final', 'scene', 'back', 'current', 'Enterprise', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'history', 'franchise', 'credits', 'roll', 'see', 'Kirk', 'gaze', 'awe', 'Talosians', 'use', 'mental', 'powers', 'restore', 'severely-disabled', 'Pike', 'full', 'joyful', 'life', 'illusion', 'have', 'reality', 'very', 'humane', 'ending', 'make', 'up', 'Talosians', 'earlier', 'bad', 'behavior']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 16: The Menagerie Part I & II VHS"

That award was well deserved, this is one of the most imaginative stories in the series. All fans of the show rejoice that Gene Roddenberry decided to use the first pilot as the basis for this two-part episode. It would have been tragic if all of the original ideas in that first pilot had not been expanded into one of the best episodes of the series.Spock reports that an urgent message has been received and the Enterprise is to report to a star base. Once they get there, the personnel at the base are surprised, stating that no such message was sent. This is the star base where Christopher Pike, the former captain of the Enterprise, resides. He was horribly mutilated in a radiation accident, he is currently in a motorized device that can respond to his brain waves. The only thing that he can do to communicate is to cause a light to flash, once for yes and two for no. His only movement is to have the device move forward and backward. However, his brain is still fully functional, so he is essentially trapped in a dysfunctional body.Spock hijacks the Enterprise and takes it to Talos IV, a planet that was visited by the Enterprise when Captain Pike commanded it. Because it is considered to be very dangerous, the only death penalty still on the books in the Federation is to deliberately go to the planet. Therefore, Spock has not only risked a court martial, he is also risking execution. Kirk and Commodore Mendes catch up with the Enterprise and since he has put the Enterprise on computer control, Spock submits to arrest and a trial.As the trial begins, images from the Enterprise's visit to Talos IV appear in the view screen. These scenes are from the first pilot and we see the events recreated. The planet is inhabited by a race of creatures with unusually large heads and is capable of creating masterful illusions. Their goal is to find suitable breeding stock so that they can repopulate their planet. Centuries earlier, a war had essentially wiped all life off the planet, the inhabitants now live underground, but they have lost the ability to repair the machines.Captain Pike meets a beautiful girl who is real, and meant to be his mate. However, he refuses and so two additional females from the Enterprise are added so that he can make his selection. He still refuses and tries to escape. Pike and his group are recaptured, but rather than submit to a life of captivity, the first officer of the Enterprise places a phaser on overload so that all the humans will be killed. Faced with this resolve, the inhabitants of Talos IV agree to release them.It turns out that Spock's actions are an act of mercy to Captain Pike. By being returned to Talos IV, the inhabitants will use their ability to create illusions to allow Captain Pike to ""live"" a normal life. At the end, Pike is seen running around and enjoying himself again. The images that were sent to the Enterprise were also seen by Star Fleet command and they waive all charges against Spock and allow Pike to stay on Talos IV.This story uses one of the strongest themes in the original series sequence, self-sacrifice for your friend. In the subsequent movies, Kirk and company were willing to sacrifice their careers to aid Spock. ""The needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many.""  In this case, Spock is willing to sacrifice himself in order to ""save"" his former captain. The amount of originality in the first pilot is still impressive, even after all these years and the number of times that I have seen it.",5,The needs of the one outweigh the needs of the one,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,3588,"['episode', 'was', 'awarded', 'Hugo', 'highest', 'award', 'given', 'science', 'fiction', 'award', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'one', 'most', 'imaginative', 'stories', 'series', 'fans', 'show', 'rejoice', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'decided', 'use', 'first', 'pilot', 'basis', 'two-part', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tragic', 'original', 'ideas', 'first', 'pilot', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'expanded', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'series.Spock', 'reports', 'urgent', 'message', 'been', 'received', 'Enterprise', 'report', 'star', 'base', 'get', 'there', 'personnel', 'base', 'are', 'surprised', 'stating', 'such', 'message', 'was', 'sent', 'star', 'base', 'where', 'Christopher', 'Pike', 'former', 'captain', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'horribly', 'mutilated', 'radiation', 'accident', 'currently', 'motorized', 'device', 'can', 'respond', 'brain', 'waves', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'communicate', 'cause', 'light', 'flash', 'once', 'yes', 'two', 'only', 'movement', 'have', 'device', 'move', 'forward', 'backward', 'However', 'brain', 'still', 'fully', 'functional', 'essentially', 'trapped', 'dysfunctional', 'body.Spock', 'Enterprise', 'Talos', 'IV', 'planet', 'was', 'visited', 'Enterprise', 'when', 'Captain', 'Pike', 'commanded', 'considered', 'be', 'very', 'dangerous', 'only', 'death', 'penalty', 'still', 'books', 'Federation', 'deliberately', 'go', 'planet', 'Therefore', 'Spock', 'not', 'only', 'risked', 'court', 'martial', 'also', 'risking', 'execution', 'Kirk', 'Commodore', 'Mendes', 'catch', 'up', 'Enterprise', 'put', 'Enterprise', 'computer', 'control', 'Spock', 'arrest', 'trial.As', 'trial', 'images', 'Enterprise', 'visit', 'Talos', 'IV', 'appear', 'view', 'screen', 'scenes', 'are', 'first', 'pilot', 'see', 'events', 'recreated', 'planet', 'inhabited', 'race', 'creatures', 'unusually', 'large', 'heads', 'capable', 'creating', 'masterful', 'illusions', 'goal', 'find', 'suitable', 'breeding', 'stock', 'so', 'can', 'repopulate', 'planet', 'Centuries', 'earlier', 'war', 'had', 'essentially', 'wiped', 'life', 'planet', 'inhabitants', 'now', 'live', 'underground', 'have', 'lost', 'ability', 'repair', 'machines.Captain', 'Pike', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'real', 'meant', 'be', 'mate', 'However', 'so', 'two', 'additional', 'females', 'Enterprise', 'are', 'added', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'selection', 'still', 'tries', 'escape', 'Pike', 'group', 'are', 'recaptured', 'rather', 'submit', 'life', 'captivity', 'first', 'officer', 'Enterprise', 'phaser', 'overload', 'humans', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'Faced', 'resolve', 'inhabitants', 'Talos', 'IV', 'agree', 'release', 'them.It', 'out', 'Spock', 'actions', 'are', 'act', 'mercy', 'Captain', 'Pike', 'being', 'returned', 'Talos', 'IV', 'inhabitants', 'will', 'use', 'ability', 'create', 'illusions', 'allow', 'Captain', 'Pike', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'end', 'Pike', 'seen', 'running', 'around', 'enjoying', 'again', 'images', 'were', 'sent', 'Enterprise', 'were', 'also', 'seen', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'command', 'waive', 'charges', 'Spock', 'allow', 'Pike', 'stay', 'Talos', 'IV.This', 'story', 'one', 'strongest', 'themes', 'original', 'series', 'sequence', 'self-sacrifice', 'friend', 'subsequent', 'movies', 'Kirk', 'company', 'were', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'careers', 'aid', 'Spock', 'needs', 'one', 'outweigh', 'needs', 'many', 'case', 'Spock', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'save', 'former', 'captain', 'amount', 'originality', 'first', 'pilot', 'still', 'impressive', 'even', 'years', 'number', 'times', 'have', 'seen']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 16: The Menagerie Part I & II VHS"

207744,AEV640MKB3I9J,630021320X,Hank Drake,"[20, 21]","&quot;The Menagerie&quot; has consistently scored as one of the top ten most popular episodes of the original series.  Both the flashback and wraparound plotlines are among the best Star Trek had to offer.  Spock is  willing to sacrifice his career--and perhaps his life--to ensure that  Christopher Pike, his former Captain--horribly disfigured by a recent space  disaster--can spend his remaining years in comfort and happiness.  If that  is not an act of love, I don't know what is.Paramount has simply  outdone itself in the remastering of this episode.  The flashback elements  date back to 1964, yet they look so fresh they could have been filmed  yesterday.  It is also  interesting to see the great care the original  cinematographer took with lighting--most of the compositions are simply  beautiful--and far superior to today's more flatly lit approach.  The sound  has been remarkably enhanced, with both the sound effects and score in  stereo.It is interesting to compare &quot;The Cage&quot; with the  original series.  Although it is very impressive as science fiction, there  is very little chemistry between the characters (similar to &quot;The Next  Generation&quot;).

207746,A3N0AXNEZVE686,630021320X,Hound Dog,"[0, 0]","As `Star Trek' rapidly approaches its 50th anniversary, it is a given that the tragic ""City on the Edge of Forever"" and the laugh-out loud ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" are considered the original TV series' best two episodes.  Still, I suggest that ""The Menagerie, Parts I & II,"" is the original series' most poignant tale and is definitely worth of re-discovery by today's generation.  Director J.J. Abrams' past two 'Trek' films have ret-conned Captain Christopher Pike (portrayed by Bruce Greenwood) as the new Captain Kirk's predecessor, mentor, and surrogate dad.  As agreeable as Greenwood's portrayal is, perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the original Pike (the late Jeffrey Hunter) whose prot&eacute;g&eacute; instead proved to be Spock.In 1965, producer Gene Roddenberry's initial `Trek' pilot entitled ""The Cage"" was rejected by NBC as being ""too cerebral,"" with too many unapppealing characters/actors and too little action.  Truth be told, NBC did Roddenberry a huge favor by allowing him an almost-unprecedented second pilot (""Where No Man Has Gone Before"") soon after and setting in motion the `Star Trek' we know today.  By late 1966, with its first season already near the halfway mark, a hard-pressed Roddenberry ingeniously recycled most of ""The Cage"" into what became ""The Menagerie, Parts I and II.""Book-ended by an intriguing storyline (set thirteen years after ""The Cage"") the plot has Spock has inexplicably abduct his invalid former captain and hijack the Enterprise, only to be court-martialed.  The original series' only two-part episode cleverly integrates mysterious ""trial evidence"" revealing how Pike and his crew encountered an illusion-casting alien race on planet Talos IV.  Played extremely well with some possibly sinister overtones, the enigmatic motive behind Spock's defiant conspiracy with the Talosians isn't revealed until near the end.  Replacing Jeffrey Hunter, actor Sean Kinney portrays a crippled, wheelchair-bound Pike suffering a hellish, vegetative existence from severe radiation exposure.  Pike's tragic condition is the only hint we initially have as to why Spock would even want to risk returning his former captain to a planet so forbidden that going there invokes the Federation's only death penalty offense.  The first half concludes with a tense scene between Kirk and Spock setting up a cliffhanger.  The mystery's solution becomes fairly obvious in the second half.  Arguably, the second half's last few minutes provide one of Spock's all-time best moments in revealing his compassion and loyalty.As for this Captain Pike and his crew, Hunter offers a solid performance while his co-stars do their best with surprisingly generic characters.  Majel Barrett (billed as M. Leigh Hudec), as Number One, and John Hoyt, as Dr. Boyce, have the best supporting parts, but the acting MVP deservedly goes to guest star Susan Oliver for her challenging role as Vina.  Leonard Nimoy's presence is notable only for being the Enterprise's token alien crew member.  Still, watch for young Spock's wide grin while examining an odd plant on Talos IV.  Nimoy and the writers hadn't yet fleshed out his character's distinctive Vulcan personality, as this Spock clearly is a rough draft.  That actually sums ups ""The Cage:"" it is a `Trek' rough draft featuring an original, intelligent storyline but missing the vital element of charismatic characters necessary to make the story really click.Beyond the actor upgrades, the vast improvement of ""The Menagerie"" over ""The Cage"" is most apparent in the difference in their finales.  Watching ""The Cage,"" the open ending clearly implied that it was simply on to the next episode, while ""The Menagerie"" will reward you with something to think about when it is over.  Hence, ""The Menagerie"" truly makes the `Trek' magic come to life by bringing all of science fiction's best elements together.  Viewing ""The Cage"" (minus a few scenes) inside ""The Menagerie, Parts I & II,"" however, remains an enlightening experience to see where `Trek' could have gone where no one has gone before.Rating: 5 stars.  Suffice to say, ""The Menagerie, Parts I & II"" offers an inspiring, sentimental theme about why one should feel blessed and fulfilled by reality --  just like enjoying any fantasy or illusion.P.S. From the same out-of-print Star Trek DVD collection (two episodes per volume), it concludes with a double feature of the original series' last episode: the dubious ""Turnabout Intruder,"" with ""The Cage"" (linking the unused black-and-white footage with its colorized ""Menagerie"" scenes).",5,"""The Menagerie, Parts I & II"" Fondly Recalls the First `Trek'",1397606400,"04 16,

THE MENAGERIE is easily one of the series best dramas and also easily one of the best episodes of the first season.  Creator Gene Roddenberry made a very clever move in this episode.  Using the footage from the (at the time) un-seen pilot episode THE CAGE, he made an episode that revolved around Captain Pike.The MENAGERIE takes place 13 years after the events that occured in THE CAGE.  Spock was a crew member aboard the USS Enterprise during Cpt. Pike's command.  However now Pike is severely crippled from a freak accident when he was saving some children.  He is still the same person he once was only trapped inside a useless body, a vegetable if you will.  When they arrive on a planet Spock and Kirk meet up with Pike after many years.  Spock kidnaps Pike and sets the Enterprises course to Rigel IV the forbidden planet.  He is arrested and sent to court for a court martial for disobeying Kirk orders.  Spock explains why he is doing this and during the court shows footage that occured 13 years ago.  If Spock is not guilty he will be able to continue his assignment if he is Kirk will be forced to find him guilty and the Vulcan will be court martialed.THE MENAGERIE was a wonderful episode that ranks as one of the series most complex plots.  Partly because it is a two parter but the best thing about this was Roddenberry was finally able to put some of the unused footage from THE CAGE to use.  Although the run of THE CAGE here is quite disjointed it gives you the basic jist of the plot.  It also features the famous bulb head aliens that treat human like zoo animals.Overall Volume 8 is a essential 2 part Trek episode that must be seen.  It is great to see Cpt. Pike again even though he is terribly scarred and says nothing.  Still this DVD is one of the collections finest.

I gleaned some of the following information (edited and mixed with my own comments) from Wikipedia for the benefit of consumers here.Here we get to see the ORIGINAL Captain of the Starship Enterprise, Jeffrey Hunter, who played the role of Captain Pike. Hunter wasn't nearly as theatrical and overdramatic as William Shatner, who ended up in the role of Captain James T. Kirk, but would have, in my opinion, been equally great for the entire series had he stayed on board.Part one of the two-part episode was broadcast on November 17, 1966 with the second part broadcast a week later on November 24, 1966.Here, Spock has to trick Captain Kirk and essentially commit treason in taking the Enterprise to the forbidden Planet, Talos IV. At his trial for that infraction, Captain Pike, a man unable to move or speak except through an electronic device, ultimately reveals the story behind Spock's bizarre deception.New filming took place for the framing story for ""The Cage,"" the Star Trek pilot film which Gene Roddenberry shrewdly utilized in the production of this episode. Since actor Jeffrey Hunter was unavailable to reprise his role as Captain Pike, a look-alike actor, Sean Kenney, played the injured captain in the new scenes of ""The Menagerie"".Sadly, in 1969, while flying back to the U.S. from Spain after filming ""Viva America!,"" Jeffrey Hunter suffered the signs of a stroke. After recovering at a hospital in Los Angeles, he suffered another stroke while at home, causing a fall and a skull fracture. He died the following day from his injuries and was ultimately interred in the Glen Haven Memorial Park cemetery in Sylmar, California.In summary, while this double episode is NOT representative of the typical Star Trek program, it's still a superb entry and any fan of science fiction television would much enjoy this intriguing and coherent story.
