1025661,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B000JBWWTC,I. Giles,"[0, 0]","This disc, recorded/issued in 2006, is another absorbing combination of deeply thoughtful and fascinating documentary coupled with an excellent performance of the work discussed in the extensive hour long documentary.In this case Michael Tilson Thomas takes us on a very personal tour of the symphony with a persuasive proposal as to how it actually came to be written in the way it is. This is a view shared by many of the interviewed orchestral players. Essentially his view is that the symphony represents Beethoven's journey through life up the point of composition. This would include his approaching deafness and all that that implies plus his well-known rejection of the original dedicatee, Napoleon upon Napoleon's becoming Emperor of France. This, and the symphonic title 'Eroica' leads Tilson Thomas to see Beethoven as being the Heroic subject of his own composition.Throughout the documentary we are shown numerous examples of the music as it unfolds to support this view. Also included are illustrated references to associated venues and events at the time of composition.In the event, knowing the music very well, I found that the following performance could be equally enjoyed with or without regard to this very detailed analysis. That is largely because Tilson Thomas actually leads a performance that follows very expected paths. Those paths also show a clear awareness of period considerations as regards tempi and phrasing which are generally swift and dramatic. The use of a full orchestra, which demonstrates admirable skill both individually and corporately throughout in the concert situation, becomes of far less importance than the very evident commitment to a completely engrossing and convincing interpretation.The camera work and clarity of imaging is excellent as in the rest of the series. The sound is presented in equally fine DTS surround format or stereo. This applies to both the documentary and the concert.I would suggest that this is a very high quality production and both documentary and performance have a great deal to offer both to those who are very familiar with the music and its origins as well as those to whom much of this may be unfamiliar territory.",5,Another absorbing documentary plus fine full-orchestra performance,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,2201,"['disc', 'recorded/issued', '2006', 'absorbing', 'combination', 'deeply', 'thoughtful', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'coupled', 'excellent', 'performance', 'work', 'discussed', 'extensive', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary.In', 'case', 'Michael', 'Tilson', 'Thomas', 'very', 'personal', 'tour', 'symphony', 'persuasive', 'proposal', 'how', 'actually', 'came', 'be', 'written', 'way', 'view', 'shared', 'many', 'interviewed', 'orchestral', 'players', 'Essentially', 'view', 'symphony', 'Beethoven', 'journey', 'life', 'up', 'point', 'composition', 'would', 'include', 'approaching', 'deafness', 'well-known', 'rejection', 'original', 'dedicatee', 'Napoleon', 'Napoleon', 'becoming', 'Emperor', 'France', 'symphonic', 'title', ""'Eroica"", 'leads', 'Tilson', 'Thomas', 'see', 'Beethoven', 'being', 'Heroic', 'subject', 'own', 'composition.Throughout', 'documentary', 'are', 'shown', 'numerous', 'examples', 'music', 'support', 'view', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'illustrated', 'references', 'associated', 'venues', 'events', 'time', 'composition.In', 'event', 'knowing', 'music', 'very', 'well', 'found', 'following', 'performance', 'could', 'be', 'equally', 'enjoyed', 'regard', 'very', 'detailed', 'analysis', 'largely', 'Tilson', 'Thomas', 'actually', 'performance', 'very', 'expected', 'paths', 'paths', 'also', 'show', 'clear', 'awareness', 'period', 'considerations', 'regards', 'tempi', 'phrasing', 'are', 'generally', 'swift', 'dramatic', 'use', 'full', 'orchestra', 'admirable', 'skill', 'individually', 'corporately', 'concert', 'situation', 'becomes', 'far', 'less', 'importance', 'very', 'evident', 'commitment', 'completely', 'engrossing', 'convincing', 'interpretation.The', 'camera', 'work', 'clarity', 'imaging', 'excellent', 'rest', 'series', 'sound', 'presented', 'equally', 'fine', 'DTS', 'surround', 'format', 'stereo', 'both', 'documentary', 'concert.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'documentary', 'performance', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'offer', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'familiar', 'music', 'origins', 'as', 'well', 'whom', 'much', 'may', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'territory']",N/A

A movement by movement explanation of a pioneering work in classical music history. MTT does a fabulous job of providing his personal insights into the music with a terrific musical ensemble.

A detailed exploration of the nearly molecular construction of the music is not undertaken (it would take quite a few DVDs for that) but the overall storyline is beautifully explained.  Beethoven's music has a poignancy that can't be denied; a sharing of thoughts and emotions with his audience that leaves both better off for the experience.

1025665,AXLN36UV9KGXD,B000JBWWTC,Mr John Haueisen,"[60, 63]","This dvd was given to me by friends who know I love to learn more and more about music.It consists of a complete performance by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra of Beethoven's Third Symphony, ""The Eroica,""ANDMichael Tilson Tilson Thomas, conducting a movement by movement ""tour"" of Beethoven's Third.  Tilson Thomas explains what was going on in Beethoven's life and provides various explanations of why the music is the way it is.  Comments are added by some of the SFSO's musicians, including their approach to playing Beethoven.I had long known of Beethoven's original intention of dedicating the symphony to Napoleon Bonaparte, whom Ludwig saw as ""a leader come from the people.""  Later, of course, when Bonaparte crowned himself emperor, Beethoven literaly scratched out the dedication to Napoleon, and it has been hereafter know simply as the Eroica, or heroic symphony.What I didn't know, which Micael Tilson Thomas explains, is that Beethoven was confronting the reality of his impending deafness, just at the time he was writing this symphony.  He explains how the symphony includes Beethoven's anguish and (unfounded) shame at being a deaf musician.  Yet he goes on to explain that Beethoven faces this demon, and the music tells us that he goes on with life.  Thus Beethoven's Eroica is heroic in more ways than is commonly known.",5,More heroic than I had realized,1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,1345,"['dvd', 'was', 'given', 'friends', 'who', 'know', 'love', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'music.It', 'consists', 'complete', 'performance', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'Beethoven', 'Third', 'Symphony', 'Eroica', 'ANDMichael', 'Tilson', 'Tilson', 'Thomas', 'conducting', 'movement', 'movement', 'tour', 'Beethoven', 'Third', 'Tilson', 'Thomas', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Beethoven', 'life', 'various', 'explanations', 'why', 'music', 'way', 'Comments', 'are', 'added', 'SFSO', 'musicians', 'including', 'approach', 'playing', 'Beethoven.I', 'had', 'long', 'known', 'Beethoven', 'original', 'intention', 'dedicating', 'symphony', 'Napoleon', 'Bonaparte', 'whom', 'Ludwig', 'saw', 'leader', 'come', 'people', 'Later', 'course', 'when', 'Bonaparte', 'crowned', 'emperor', 'Beethoven', 'literaly', 'scratched', 'out', 'dedication', 'Napoleon', 'been', 'hereafter', 'know', 'simply', 'Eroica', 'heroic', 'symphony.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Micael', 'Tilson', 'Thomas', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'confronting', 'reality', 'impending', 'deafness', 'just', 'time', 'was', 'writing', 'symphony', 'how', 'symphony', 'Beethoven', 'anguish', 'unfounded', 'shame', 'being', 'deaf', 'musician', 'explain', 'Beethoven', 'demon', 'music', 'life', 'Thus', 'Beethoven', 'Eroica', 'heroic', 'more', 'ways', 'commonly', 'known']",N/A

The instructor gave us LPs of three classical works: Beethoven's Eroica, Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, and a symphony by Cesar Franck. I was fascinated by Eroica and listened to it over and over.Now with Michael Tilson Thomas' series Keeping Score, anyone interested in classical music can get a deep analysis of the major revolutions in classical music. There are 6 DVDs and several blu-rays available from KVIE in San Francisco and PBS. Season 1 includes Beethoven, Stravinsky and Copland. Season 2 features Berlioz, Ives and Shostakovich.Beethoven's Third Symphony is a good place to start. Beethoven came to Vienna, the sophisticated music capital of the world as a rough youth from the hinterlands of Germany who had to prove himself. Thomas tells the story of Beethoven's encounter with a young rival who had mocked one of his compositions by improvising variations to the main theme. Beethoven totally destroyed him by turning the rival's score upside down and writing a new work based on it.Thomas' commentary is anything but pedantic. He uses humor to make his point with references to Chuck Berry and Elvis. He explains the importance of Beethoven's impending deafness during this early period and tells how he overcame that handicap. By the time he completed his final symphony, the ninth, he was totally deaf.Thomas illustrates his points by playing relevant passages from the symphony and concludes with a full performance by the San Francisco Symphony.After watching this DVD you will want to see the other titles in the series.",5,A Music Appreciation Course on DVD,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,1632,"['first', 'contact', 'classical', 'music', 'was', 'music', 'appreciation', 'course', 'college', 'instructor', 'gave', 'LPs', 'three', 'classical', 'works', 'Beethoven', 'Eroica', 'Bartok', 'Concerto', 'Orchestra', 'symphony', 'Cesar', 'Franck', 'was', 'fascinated', 'Eroica', 'listened', 'over.Now', 'Michael', 'Tilson', 'Thomas', 'series', 'Keeping', 'Score', 'anyone', 'interested', 'classical', 'music', 'can', 'get', 'deep', 'analysis', 'major', 'revolutions', 'classical', 'music', 'are', '6', 'DVDs', 'several', 'blu-rays', 'available', 'KVIE', 'San', 'Francisco', 'PBS', 'Season', '1', 'Beethoven', 'Stravinsky', 'Copland', 'Season', '2', 'features', 'Berlioz', 'Ives', 'Shostakovich.Beethoven', 'Third', 'Symphony', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'Beethoven', 'came', 'Vienna', 'sophisticated', 'music', 'capital', 'world', 'rough', 'youth', 'hinterlands', 'Germany', 'who', 'had', 'prove', 'Thomas', 'story', 'Beethoven', 'encounter', 'young', 'rival', 'who', 'had', 'mocked', 'one', 'compositions', 'improvising', 'variations', 'main', 'theme', 'Beethoven', 'totally', 'destroyed', 'turning', 'rival', 'score', 'upside', 'down', 'writing', 'new', 'work', 'based', 'it.Thomas', 'commentary', 'anything', 'pedantic', 'humor', 'make', 'point', 'references', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Elvis', 'importance', 'Beethoven', 'impending', 'deafness', 'early', 'period', 'how', 'handicap', 'time', 'completed', 'final', 'symphony', 'ninth', 'was', 'totally', 'deaf.Thomas', 'points', 'playing', 'relevant', 'passages', 'symphony', 'full', 'performance', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Symphony.After', 'watching', 'DVD', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'other', 'titles', 'series']",N/A
