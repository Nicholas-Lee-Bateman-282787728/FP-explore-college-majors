McGregor portrays Leeson as a charmer white collar criminal who ended up sentenced to six years in a Chinese prison for insider trading and fraud.  Diagnosed with cancer, Leeson wrote his memoirs and low and behold it became a film.  Ewan McGregor plays the self-absorbed, arrogant Leeson with his usual competence and energy.  Anna Friel is his in the dark wife who yearns to be pregnant but can't interest her husband away from the trading floor.  This is story of greed, larceny, and speculation on a grand scale.

His defalcation in this capacity (to the tune of over 1.3 billion dollars) led to Baring's unexpected collapse and about 6 years of jail time for the miscreant.While behind bars, he wrote a story of his life entitled ""Rogue Trader.""  This movie is heavily based on that book.As for the quality of what you're getting here, I have to say the whole thing's a bit puzzling.On the surface, there seems nothing wrong with this movie.  The acting is all fine, the directing fine, the script fine.  In theory the subject matter is interesting and the filmmakers make no obvious blunders.Yet it's one of those movies that has so little to recommend it that months later you probably won't even be able to remember watching it.Can't quite put my thumb on why:  I've read Leeson's book and found it entertaining in a grisly sort of way.But here we have a movie, and a movie that simply doesn't work.Is that because Leeson's story simply does not lend itself well to the medium of film?  Is is because the whole thing is predictable and there really aren't any twists?  Is is because what Leeson was doing was so complicated that, despite the valiant efforts of the filmmakers, you spend the entire movie more or less in a fog?

Of how one mans ambition was overcome by pressures, and in turn, reckless gambling.An incredible aspect of this case was  how Leeson covered up for so long, and fooled  so many, who it seemed, were so wrapped up in their own company rhetoric they simply wanted to believe in Leeson. The regional manager in Singapore had never even heard of the name of the brokerage house Leeson used to &quot;invent&quot; a trade to cover the missing and ever increasing deficit being incured in the &quot;88888&quot; account, a supposed customer account, but in reality, an back office error account.The pace of the story is very well done here. My only gripe is, for a film with excellent supporting cast, why did they take so little care over the choice of the leading players?

515280,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00002RAPA,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""Rogue Trader"" is based on the book of the same name by Nick Leeson and journalist Edward Whitley, which covers the events that caused the insolvency and eventual sale of the venerable Barings Bank to ING for 1 in 1995. Leeson was the inept derivatives trader who lost over 200 million of Barings' money that ballooned to nearly 1 billion as Barings was forced to sell its positions. Like the book, the movie ""Rogue Trader"" tells the story from Leeson's perspective. Leeson (Ewan MacGregor) sorted out some problems with bearer bonds in Barings' Jakarta office and was rewarded with his own derivatives department in Singapore. He was supposed to be arbitraging Nikkei futures for client accounts. But he actually took huge long positions with the bank's money, which tanked when the Nikkei took a dive after the earthquake in Kobe, Japan.Leeson used various fraudulent accounting practices to cover up his losses and string his positions along for a while. His superiors at Barings didn't ask questions as long as the profits looked good on paper. Leeson blamed them for the losses, accusing his aristocratic employers of being stupid and so embarrassed by their ignorance of modern finance that they didn't ask questions. So it's no surprise that the folks at Barings are presented as dolts in this film. It's unclear exactly how the filmmakers want to present Nick Leeson. He was, after all, one of the most incompetent traders ever -and one of the biggest crooks. People don't get much dumber. So I'm not sure it's wise to have Nick narrate the film or to take the perspective of his book, seeing as it is the perspective of an idiot and a criminal.This could have been an interesting cautionary tale, but its perspective is too narrow and disingenuous. We spend an hour and a half watching a guy worry about his positions. Occasionally, a stuffed shirt at Barings interjects a half-hearted attempt to figure it out. The state of Nick's marriage and his emotions are irrelevant. There are more interesting things to say about why a reputable bank put itself in the hands of a narcissistic duffer with no prior derivatives experience. ""Rogue Trader"" needs a broader perspective. Banks do entrust fast-talking upstarts with too much money. They don't always understand the intricacies of the financial instruments they deal in. And low-risk methods of making money are simply inadequate. Hence, debacles like this one. But the story ""Rogue Trader"" presents is shallow and trivial. Anything meaningful must be read between the lines. English captions are available on the Miramax 1999 DVD.",3,Interesting Material.

I already had heard somethings on Leeson and his trading, but didn't quite knew the details. This movie gave a pretty detailed overview on how he started out, got to the bank in Singapore and got the chance to start his with his on team of employees in the trading pit on the SIPEX.I guess the question most of the people would ask themselves is why Leeson let It com so far with his secret account to hide the losses (his 88888-account). I guess the guy didn't know pretty good what he was doing back then himself. As a trader myself, I found It interesting to see Leeson actually made most his big losses while trying to recoup earlier (smaller) losses. Once you're on a losing string it's better to cut back your trading activity for some days.The guy certainly had some bad luck, writing a straddle on the SIMEX index futures right before a big earthquake hit in. Afterward he just kept on betting the index would recover (through ITM calls and long open futures positions) which he just kept increasing as far as I understood. In order to hide these huge losses he cheated with a signed letter and a fax machine. From this point on he just continued his cheating.Ewan Mc Gregor was the right guy for this movie.Certainly advised if you're into trading.",4,Good film on what Leeson did back in the days,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,1323,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'pretty', 'pleased', 'already', 'had', 'heard', 'somethings', 'Leeson', 'trading', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'knew', 'details', 'movie', 'gave', 'pretty', 'detailed', 'overview', 'how', 'started', 'out', 'got', 'bank', 'Singapore', 'got', 'chance', 'start', 'team', 'employees', 'trading', 'pit', 'SIPEX.I', 'guess', 'question', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'ask', 'why', 'Leeson', 'let', 'com', 'so', 'far', 'secret', 'account', 'hide', 'losses', '88888-account', 'guess', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'back', 'then', 'trader', 'found', 'interesting', 'see', 'Leeson', 'actually', 'made', 'most', 'big', 'losses', 'trying', 'recoup', 'earlier', 'smaller', 'losses', 'Once', ""'re"", 'losing', 'string', 'better', 'cut', 'back', 'trading', 'activity', 'days.The', 'guy', 'certainly', 'had', 'bad', 'luck', 'writing', 'straddle', 'SIMEX', 'index', 'futures', 'right', 'big', 'earthquake', 'hit', 'Afterward', 'just', 'kept', 'betting', 'index', 'would', 'recover', 'ITM', 'calls', 'long', 'open', 'futures', 'positions', 'just', 'kept', 'increasing', 'as', 'far', 'understood', 'order', 'hide', 'huge', 'losses', 'cheated', 'signed', 'letter', 'fax', 'machine', 'point', 'just', 'continued', 'cheating.Ewan', 'Mc', 'Gregor', 'was', 'right', 'guy', 'movie.Certainly', 'advised', ""'re"", 'trading']",N/A

There's at least two generations who grew up never realizing that producer David Frost used to a vicious satirist, and this is the movie equivalent of one of his interviews, going along with his subjects' account of events no matter how outrageous the excuses become: here he seems to have blown several million pounds providing a celluloid alibi for a dodgy dealer. Thus Ewan McGregor's Nick Leeson becomes a loveable cockney who only got into this mess to save a bullied colleague's job and to save managements' bonuses without disappointing his wife or the memory of his dear old mum.
