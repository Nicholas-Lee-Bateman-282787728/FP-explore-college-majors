1680782,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00GSBQ2HU,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","The story of Nelson Mandela&#8217;s life is certainly an inspiring one.  He has touched the lives of so many people and given hope and paved the way for a better tomorrow for so many that telling his story properly becomes a great responsibility.  You can&#8217;t mess this up.  Too much is at stake.  When it was announced that a film about his life was going to be released, I became skeptical.This is a BIG story to tell, even at nearly two and a half hours.While 2009 gave us a film that focused on a small portion of Mandela&#8217;s life (a portion that this film doesn&#8217;t even mention) it felt so unimportant (to the point where I never felt the slightest desire to see it, and still don&#8217;t).  Despite this film&#8217;s horrible title (yes, it sounds like a Lifetime movie), the idea of covering so much of this man&#8217;s life (all of it) was such an intriguing premise that I felt a strong urge to root for this to succeed.  Add to that the fact that Idris Elba deserves a role meaty enough to sustain his talent and Naomie Harris is one of those actresses who should have broken out in a big way YEARS ago, and you have me eagerly anticipating the day I can get my hands on this film.Then it came and went without any real impact outside of that brief moment where it looked like &#8216;Let it Go&#8217; was going to LOSE the Original Song Oscar (really, it never looked that way, but The Globes sent shivers) and so it left me wondering just how well this film captured all it needed to capture.For me, &#8216;Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom&#8217; has the look and feel of a great Hollywood epic, but it lacks something very important; substance.  I know that that sounds rather harsh and maybe even inaccurate when you consider the weight that is associated (and rightfully so) with the name Nelson Mandela, but the truth of the matter is that when the film is over the audience isn&#8217;t brought to any deeper understanding of who he is, and in all honesty his life almost feels vacant of real honest meaning.Everything feels so superficial.The problem with a film like this is that it tries to cover so much ground, it sacrifices key details.  So little time is spent on key moments in his life that it feels so unimportant.  His first marriage is basically thrown away, as is his relationship with his children, and what is even more alarming is that his fight for equality is given absolutely no depth.  There is no basis for his ascension to deity among the people because we&#8217;re only really given one or two scenes of him chanting with fists in the air to show us, supposedly, that he is a great leader.  His life was deeper than that, and so it was a shame to see it all get this kind of treatment.  It also doesn&#8217;t help that the 27 years he spent in prison are portrayed as a mere plot point and not give their just detail.  The progression of time issue that was present in &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; was also a problem here.  Those 27 years take up about thirty minutes of screen-time and they all feel so condensed.  It felt like they were showing me 2 years, not 27.The treatment this story received showed in the way the performances were crafted.  Idris Elba deserved a better script and more time to develop this man, because he had so much right.  His voice, his stance, his brooding all felt so alive and real and yet his character almost feels like a prop and not the center of the film.  Naomie Harris, who is usually so captivating, is horribly uneven here, and again this is largely due to the fact that so many aspects of her life are given such minimal time to develop.  Her numerous stints in prison fly by in a few moments and so her character&#8217;s emotional anguish and eventual hardening feel too sudden and, like the rest of this movie, superficial.The film is beautifully lensed and the score is marvelous (not to mention those costumes and sets, which scream of authenticity and are truly eye catching) but this film needed another hour or two to really develop.  Instead we are given an empty look at a rich life, and that is a true shame.",3,Not even the half of it&#8230;,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,4111,"['story', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', '8217', 's', 'life', 'certainly', 'inspiring', 'one', 'touched', 'lives', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'given', 'hope', 'paved', 'way', 'better', 'tomorrow', 'so', 'many', 'telling', 'story', 'properly', 'great', 'responsibility', 'can', '8217', 'mess', 'up', 'Too', 'much', 'stake', 'When', 'was', 'announced', 'film', 'life', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'became', 'skeptical.This', 'BIG', 'story', 'tell', 'even', 'nearly', 'two', 'half', 'hours.While', '2009', 'gave', 'film', 'focused', 'small', 'portion', 'Mandela', '8217', 's', 'life', 'portion', 'film', 'doesn', '8217', 'even', 'mention', 'felt', 'so', 'unimportant', 'point', 'where', 'never', 'felt', 'slightest', 'desire', 'see', 'still', 'don', '8217', 't', 'film', '8217', 'horrible', 'title', 'yes', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'idea', 'covering', 'so', 'much', 'man', '8217', 's', 'life', 'was', 'such', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'felt', 'strong', 'urge', 'root', 'succeed', 'Add', 'fact', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'role', 'meaty', 'enough', 'sustain', 'talent', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'one', 'actresses', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'broken', 'out', 'big', 'way', 'YEARS', 'ago', 'have', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'day', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'film.Then', 'came', 'went', 'real', 'impact', 'brief', 'moment', 'where', 'looked', '8216', 'Let', 'Go', '8217', 'was', 'going', 'LOSE', 'Original', 'Song', 'Oscar', 'really', 'never', 'looked', 'way', 'Globes', 'sent', 'shivers', 'left', 'wondering', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'captured', 'needed', 'capture.For', '8216', 'Mandela', 'Long', 'Walk', 'Freedom', '8217', 'look', 'feel', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'epic', 'something', 'very', 'important', 'substance', 'know', 'rather', 'harsh', 'maybe', 'even', 'inaccurate', 'when', 'consider', 'weight', 'associated', 'rightfully', 'so', 'name', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'truth', 'matter', 'when', 'film', 'audience', 'isn', '8217', 'brought', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'who', 'honesty', 'life', 'almost', 'feels', 'vacant', 'real', 'honest', 'meaning.Everything', 'feels', 'so', 'superficial.The', 'problem', 'film', 'cover', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'key', 'details', 'So', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'key', 'moments', 'life', 'so', 'unimportant', 'first', 'marriage', 'basically', 'thrown', 'away', 'relationship', 'children', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'alarming', 'fight', 'equality', 'given', 'absolutely', 'depth', 'basis', 'ascension', 'deity', 'people', '8217', 'only', 'really', 'given', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'chanting', 'fists', 'air', 'show', 'supposedly', 'great', 'leader', 'life', 'was', 'deeper', 'was', 'shame', 'see', 'get', 'kind', 'treatment', 'also', 'doesn', '8217', 'help', '27', 'years', 'spent', 'prison', 'are', 'portrayed', 'mere', 'plot', 'point', 'not', 'give', 'just', 'detail', 'progression', 'time', 'issue', 'was', 'present', '8217', '12', 'Slave', '8217', 'was', 'also', 'problem', 'here', '27', 'years', 'take', 'up', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'screen-time', 'feel', 'so', 'condensed', 'felt', 'were', 'showing', '2', 'years', 'not', '27.The', 'treatment', 'story', 'received', 'showed', 'way', 'performances', 'were', 'crafted', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'deserved', 'better', 'script', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'man', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'right', 'voice', 'stance', 'brooding', 'felt', 'so', 'alive', 'real', 'yet', 'character', 'almost', 'feels', 'prop', 'not', 'center', 'film', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'who', 'usually', 'so', 'captivating', 'horribly', 'uneven', 'here', 'again', 'largely', 'due', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'life', 'are', 'given', 'such', 'minimal', 'time', 'develop', 'numerous', 'stints', 'prison', 'fly', 'few', 'moments', 'so', 'character', '8217', 'emotional', 'anguish', 'eventual', 'hardening', 'feel', 'too', 'sudden', 'rest', 'movie', 'superficial.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'lensed', 'score', 'marvelous', 'not', 'mention', 'costumes', 'sets', 'scream', 'authenticity', 'are', 'truly', 'eye', 'catching', 'film', 'needed', 'hour', 'two', 'really', 'develop', 'Instead', 'are', 'given', 'empty', 'look', 'rich', 'life', 'true', 'shame']",Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

1680785,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00GSBQ2HU,Anthony L.,"[6, 11]","MANDELA: LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is elevated above your average biopic by a towering performance from that singular 6'2 charisma machine,Idris Elba. Idris Elba is one of the great black actors of our time; he carries the gravity of Denzel, the charisma of a demigod, and the magnetism to make lesser men weep. He's cancelled the apocalypse, saved the world twice, and now turns his talent to the role of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.The temptation to play Mandela as a larger-than-life figure must have been great, but Elba's performance is human and sympathetic. The weight of the years of pain, injustice, and violence weigh heavy on his shoulders, but there is steel in his voice. Elba perfects the complex African accent, and works through difficult age makeup to bring Mandela's older self to life. In my opinion, this is the finest depiction of Mandela to grace the big screen yet.But alongside Elba, and a worthy companion to him, is an equally towering Naomie Harris as Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Playing alongside Idris Elba is a tall order, but if any actress could do it, it's Naomie Harris. Showing her range from pirates to spies, Harris is one of the most diverse actresses working today. Even when the film takes on a rather predictable structure in the second act, her moving performance is described by critics as ""a crucial injection of warmth and humanity"" and ""a firecracker"".So now we get to the ""con"" part of the review. Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom does not have many problems, but it does have big ones. While there are portions of the film that successfully bring to life Mandela's character and the events surrounding him, the film's scope is too epic, and often stoops to rote fact-by-fact narration of Mandela's colorful life. It's pace is too quick and grand, covering too much ground, without pausing to savor certain moments or give true insight into character. A more focused screenplay would have saved this film a lot of grief.CONCLUSION: On the whole, MANDELA: LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is hugely flawed - at times, it covers too much ground without paying attention to character - but also technically striking, and a powerfully acted glimpse into the life of one of history's greatest peacemakers and visionaries...made only more poignant by the great man's death.

The aging process is not handled very well.The pacing is pretty descent, director Justin Chadwick did manage to show a lot in this 140 minute movie without ever getting boring.But MANDELA: LONG WALK TO FREEDOM overall feels like a propaganda movie.This would-be &#34;documentary&#34; is a complete failure, because it is dishonest and simply omits the inconvenient truths of Mandela's past.We get the impression during the film, that Mandela was somehow &#34;wrongly&#34; imprisoned for 27 years, while in reality he was imprisoned for acts of terrorism. He was commander of the &#34;Umkhonto we Sizwe&#34;, the armed militia of the African National Congress (ANC), which was responsible for numerous bombings between 1981 and 1989, targeting and killing several civilians at churches, bars, restaurants, shopping centers and courts. What do you call a man responsible for such crimes? A terrorist. What do you call an organization responsible for such crimes? A terrorist organization. Not so in MANDELA: LONG WALK TO FREEDOM, where these acts are simply omitted and Mandela is a HERO and the ANC a righteous organization of freedom fighters.&#34;Necklacing&#34;, invented by the great Mandela, a common form of execution performed by the righteous ANC, which is carried out by forcing a car tire filled with gasoline around the victim's neck or torso and setting it on fire, is mentioned but once in a dismissive way.The ANC also considered a landmine program on rural roads, which was scrapped, though, after realizing that it would also have a high rate of black laborer casualties.Torture and brutal executions (&#34;necklacings&#34;) were commonly practiced by Umkhonto we Sizwe members throughout the 80s.I will not go into Mandela's failed marriage with Evelyn Mase, the domestic violence or his womanzing.It is true that Nelson Mandela later distanced himself from most of the violence he was responsible for, but that does not make him the saint that this movie tries to make him and many people try to make him in real life.",1,A DISHONEST MOVIE.,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,2465,"['Idris', 'Elba', 'memorable', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'other', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Naomie', 'Harris', 'Winnie', 'Mandela', 'remain', 'rather', 'third', 'class', 'side', 'show.Never', 'mind', 'Elba', 'similarity', 'whatsoever', 'real', 'Mandela', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'Mandela', 'was', 'unique', 'looking', 'individual', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'long', 'period', 'movie', 'idea', 'using', 'just', 'one', 'actor', 'was', 'such', 'good', 'idea', 'aging', 'process', 'not', 'handled', 'very', 'well.The', 'pacing', 'pretty', 'descent', 'director', 'Justin', 'Chadwick', 'did', 'manage', 'show', 'lot', '140', 'minute', 'movie', 'ever', 'getting', 'boring.But', 'MANDELA', 'LONG', 'WALK', 'TO', 'FREEDOM', 'overall', 'feels', 'propaganda', 'movie.This', 'would-be', '34', 'documentary', '34', 'complete', 'failure', 'dishonest', 'simply', 'inconvenient', 'truths', 'Mandela', 'past.We', 'get', 'impression', 'film', 'Mandela', 'was', 'somehow', '34', 'wrongly', '34', 'imprisoned', '27', 'years', 'reality', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'was', 'commander', '34', 'Sizwe', '34', 'armed', 'militia', 'African', 'National', 'Congress', 'ANC', 'was', 'responsible', 'numerous', 'bombings', '1981', '1989', 'targeting', 'killing', 'several', 'civilians', 'churches', 'bars', 'restaurants', 'shopping', 'centers', 'courts', 'What', 'do', 'call', 'man', 'responsible', 'such', 'crimes', 'terrorist', 'What', 'do', 'call', 'organization', 'responsible', 'such', 'crimes', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'Not', 'so', 'MANDELA', 'LONG', 'WALK', 'TO', 'FREEDOM', 'where', 'acts', 'are', 'simply', 'omitted', 'Mandela', 'HERO', 'ANC', 'righteous', 'organization', 'freedom', 'fighters.', '34', 'Necklacing', '34', 'invented', 'great', 'Mandela', 'common', 'form', 'execution', 'performed', 'righteous', 'ANC', 'carried', 'out', 'forcing', 'car', 'tire', 'filled', 'gasoline', 'victim', 'neck', 'torso', 'setting', 'fire', 'mentioned', 'once', 'dismissive', 'way.The', 'ANC', 'also', 'considered', 'landmine', 'program', 'rural', 'roads', 'was', 'scrapped', 'realizing', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'high', 'rate', 'black', 'laborer', 'casualties.Torture', 'brutal', 'executions', '34', 'necklacings', '34', 'were', 'commonly', 'practiced', 'Umkhonto', 'Sizwe', 'members', '80s.I', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'Mandela', 'failed', 'marriage', 'Evelyn', 'Mase', 'domestic', 'violence', 'womanzing.It', 'true', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'later', 'distanced', 'most', 'violence', 'was', 'responsible', 'not', 'make', 'saint', 'movie', 'make', 'many', 'people', 'try', 'make', 'real', 'life']",Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

Although facially unlike Nelson Mandela, he captures the great man's mannerisms and speech-patterns with uncanny accuracy.  Throughout his long life, depicted in MANDELA from his humble beginnings as a lawyer to his final accession to the Presidency of the Republic of South Africa in the mid-1990s, he comes across as a devoted family man, who is nonetheless devoted to the nationalist cause.  When faced with a choice between domesticity and politics, he inevitably chooses the latter option.  This might not necessarily be the best for him, but it is something that he believes he must do for the cause of the African National Congress.  Although not by nature a violent man, Elba's Mandela is nonetheless pragmatic; as the Sixties wear on, he understands that violence is necessary in order to advance the cause of African equality in the apartheid regime.  While this performance stands out in the film, the handling of post-1945 South African history is superficially handled.  We are not told why the apartheid regime came into being in the late Forties; nor does the film explain how and why it fundamentally differed from the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.  For the first half-hour, the film adopts a comic-strip approach to history; a series of apparently disparate sequences follow one another with little concern for historical coherence.  It is only when Mandela is sent to Robben Island for life imprisonment that the structure becomes more comprehensible.  When Mandela is released from prison, the film once again fails to provide explanations for the sudden outbreak of violence in the townships following his release, when it seemed that African was fighting African as well as the white minority.  Nor does the film acknowledge the contribution made by other members of the ANC (African National Congress) - for example, Oliver Tambo.  Viewers expecting to learn something about South African history since 1945 will be sadly disappointed.",3,Worthy but Superficial Account of a Great Man's Life,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,2062,"['heart', 'Justin', 'Chadwick', 'film', 'wondrous', 'central', 'performance', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'facially', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'great', 'man', 'mannerisms', 'speech-patterns', 'uncanny', 'accuracy', 'long', 'life', 'depicted', 'MANDELA', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'lawyer', 'final', 'accession', 'Presidency', 'Republic', 'South', 'Africa', 'mid-1990s', 'across', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'devoted', 'nationalist', 'cause', 'When', 'faced', 'choice', 'domesticity', 'politics', 'inevitably', 'latter', 'option', 'might', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'best', 'something', 'must', 'do', 'cause', 'African', 'National', 'Congress', 'not', 'nature', 'violent', 'man', 'Elba', 'Mandela', 'nonetheless', 'pragmatic', 'Sixties', 'wear', 'violence', 'necessary', 'order', 'advance', 'cause', 'African', 'equality', 'apartheid', 'regime', 'performance', 'out', 'film', 'handling', 'post-1945', 'South', 'African', 'history', 'superficially', 'handled', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'why', 'apartheid', 'regime', 'came', 'being', 'late', 'Forties', 'film', 'explain', 'how', 'why', 'fundamentally', 'differed', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'United', 'States', 'first', 'half-hour', 'film', 'comic-strip', 'approach', 'history', 'series', 'apparently', 'disparate', 'sequences', 'follow', 'one', 'little', 'concern', 'historical', 'coherence', 'only', 'when', 'Mandela', 'sent', 'Robben', 'Island', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'structure', 'more', 'comprehensible', 'When', 'Mandela', 'released', 'prison', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'provide', 'explanations', 'sudden', 'outbreak', 'violence', 'townships', 'following', 'release', 'when', 'seemed', 'African', 'was', 'fighting', 'African', 'as', 'well', 'white', 'minority', 'film', 'acknowledge', 'contribution', 'made', 'other', 'members', 'ANC', 'African', 'National', 'Congress', 'example', 'Oliver', 'Tambo', 'Viewers', 'expecting', 'learn', 'something', 'South', 'African', 'history', '1945', 'will', 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointed']",Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

1680802,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00GSBQ2HU,FNDNreview,"[8, 12]","History will remember the late, great Nelson Mandela as one of the world's most important leaders. His devotion to South Africa and to the freedom of his people is a unparalleled, putting him in the company of immortal human rights icons, like Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Gandi, and Malcolm X. Mandela spent nearly half of his life incarcerated as a unique living martyr &#8211; and although he was out of sight, he was never out of mind. Looking back at the life of Mandela, he is an inspiration for all of use, proving that no matter how difficult something becomes, if you give yourself to a cause and demand change, you will reap the rewards. And, also like history's greatest figures, Nelson Mandela will likely see his immortality recognized many times over on the big screen &#8211; the first of which is Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.Director Justin Chadwick (The Other Boleyn Girl, The First Grader) helms this Nelson Mandela biopic, starring Idris Elba as Nelson Mandela. When the film begins, we see shades of Mandela entering adulthood, eventually moving quickly into his days as a lawyer. It doesn't take long for this film to set a disturbing tone of racial inequality in the troubled county of South Africa. Before focusing on his prominent role in fighting apartheid (forced racial segregation), the film turns its attention to his first marriage &#8211; which is slowly deteriorates due to his prolonged absence and infidelity.After his first wife leaves him, Mandela turns his sights to protests and speaking to supporters of the freedom fighter cause. At the same time, he meets Winnie Madikizela (Naomie Harris), whom he quickly falls for, marries, and incorporates in their battle for freedom. With his people behind him, Mandela is now a polarizing figure that's hunted for allegedly being behind a violent revolution with the intent to overthrow the nation. He, and those close to him, are eventually apprehended and given life imprisonment &#8211; but if you think that would be enough to deter a revolution, you're wrong. Even behind bars, Nelson Mandela finds ways to inspire his closest friends and a country desperate for change.Biopics can be a bear to tackle, especially when they're based squally on the majority of one man's life. Nelson Mandela accomplished more in his life than you could ever hope to put into a roughly 2 hour film. With that being said, Long Walk to Freedom, based on the autobiography of the same name written by Nelson Mandela, chronicles the most important aspects of his life &#8211; at lest the important moments regarding peace for South Africa. And, if you even vaguely recall the history of South Africa, then you know it's a dark, desperate time. Keeping with that idea, this film does nothing to shy away from the endless amount of violence that took place. One moment in particular is highlighted &#8211; that being the disturbing and pivotal moment in 1960 when South African police officers opened fire on unarmed protesters.There are several crucial, moving events that take place over the course of this film &#8211; but as you might expect, many of them have a tendency to feel rushed. Everything moves at a relatively quick pace, but the one thing that makes it such a joy to witness is the acting work of Idris Elba. It's hard to imagine the pressures of taking on such a monumental figure, but Elba does so with such awe-inspiring grace. No, there's nothing about Elba that resembles Nelson Mandela, but Elba's attempt to reenact his voice is both noteworthy and impressive. Elba's portrayal is not only appealing and engaging, but one would like to think that even Nelson Mandela would have been proud of this performance.This film is one dominated by mostly two figures, one of which is Nelson Mandela and the other being his wife, Winnie &#8211; played splendidly by Naomie Harris. While Mandela is a peaceful man that resists the urge to turn to violence, his wife appears to be far more vengeful. You could easily call this couple, who spend far more time apart than together, two different sides of the same coin. One is patient and picks his spots to act, while the other is full of rage and actively involved in the belief to fight &#8211; not just figuratively, but physically. Harris adds anger to a film that is surprisingly calm, all be it melancholy and hopelessly resilient.Overall, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom is your average biopic that bites off quite a bit of information and tries to incorporate it in a restricted amount of time. However, while it does seem chopping and off-key at times, it doesn't hinder the quality of the film. There's no shortage of drama to be found in Mandela's life story, but much of it &#8211; like his children, marriage, and worldwide diplomacy as the eventual President of South Africa, are overlooked to tell a more concise story about the country's struggles for freedom. Idris Elba and Naomie Harris both give quality performances, which greatly improve this film, and if nothing else, Long Walk to Freedom tells a tremendous story that will serve as a satisfactory vehicle for information about one of the greatest leaders in modern history. This film should be viewed by any and all that have an interest in world history or the beloved Nelson Mandela.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,"Idris Elba shines in biopic, 'Mandela: Long Walk to

For some reason it seems to skip the international honors he was awarded, e.g., The Nobel Peace Prize, but offers a rich story arc of his wife Winnie.We watch:* Idris Elba (""Luther"") as Nelson Mandela, a cunning lawyer, a cautious revolutionary and a crafty prisoner. He was arrested for his ANC activities, for which he was given the death sentence, commuted to life. He served 27 years in two different prisons during which his wife Winnie and the ANC launched an effective, international ""Free Mandela"" campaign, augmented by trade embargoes and other pressures brought to bear on the apartheid government of South Africa.* Naomie Harris (""Skyfall"") is Winnie Mandela, his second wife; mother of his two daughters; an intelligent and proactive participant in his life. After being imprisoned, she became a dedicated terrorist who vilified her white oppressors. Her rabid activism became a liability to him later in life.As a fan of Idris Elba ever since ""The Wire,"" I would be happy to watch him read a telephone book, so even though this gave him plenty to do, I would have appreciated a better script. William Nicholson based his screenplay on Mandela's autobiography, but tried (unwisely) to make this film encompass his entire life. Director Justin Chadwick (""The Other Boleyn Girl"") uses flashbacks and other devices to fill in the blanks.This movie had the mixed blessing of being released 20 days after Mandela's death at age 95, so there was more than uncommon interest in his life.

1680813,A19H2PZCIUA8UF,B00GSBQ2HU,"Kelly Cyr ""Author of Supreme Love: A Battered...","[0, 1]","I liked this movie more because I wanted to know more about Nelson Mandela. If you read his Wikipedia page, you will see that he had a horrendous life and paid hard for his beliefs. What astounded me was his message of ""Together, we are strong"" which helped unite his people, because alone you can do nothing really. And I was amazed that his followers kept him in mind as the years progressed during his incarceration. Here in the United States, I have found many people to be too apathetic and too self-involved to really want to protest wrongs or correct injustices. So apathetic in my hometown of Great Falls, Montana, that we only had a 12% voter turn-out for our last election! So my admiration grows for those who have the fighting spirit to change the world, like Mandela did and I also admire the black South Africans who helped him.The apartheid movement in South Africa matched our Civil movement here. Mandela led that and then through the process of militant fighting which he was involved with and called a terrorist, he finally comes to a peace with the South African government upon his release from prison. I was thinking at the time, that he was getting older then, and as you age, you realize that fighting does not remain the single answer. War always comes before peace. He was becoming more peaceful and resigned and a lot of the credit has to be given to the former South African president before him too.I'm very glad that country has straightened out now and for myself, racism is just plain ignorance. This is a global world now, everyone is coming together, marrying and forming families. I, myself am married to an Englishmen, my sister-in-law's daughter-in-law is Vietnamese, my stepmother just welcomed her new grandson who is half-black and I have a niece that has a Hispanic son. And I've always had many couple friends who are of mixed origins. It's only going to be more so, so people need to open their minds, forget their prejudices and welcome the diversity. The world is becoming more one now with the advent of the internet interconnecting with another, and if you think you and your descendants are just going to stay in your race, well, you are dead wrong.I believe Nelson Mandela died a happy man and he did live 96 years surrounded by his beloved family and his people at the end. His life did make a difference and I applaud his efforts and his struggles. I hope this movie serves as a message that segregation will always be wrong and there is no purpose in it.

The movie&#8217;s one problem is that many of the political complexities of South Africa are skimmed over, so that if viewers are unfamiliar with the history of that nation, they are likely to be confused as to the &#8220;how&#8221; and the &#8220;why&#8221; certain events took placeIdris Elba delivers a compelling performance as Nelson Mandela, from his salad days as a young lawyer, through his years as a political leader and human rights advocate, which resulted in his serving twenty-seven years in prison, to his election as President of South Africa.  It is a portrait that not only presents the qualities that made Mandela a great leader of a torn country, but also his frailties as a human being.Naomie Harris is equally effective as Winnie Mandela, Nelson&#8217;s second wife who starts out as a sweet, virtual &#8220;innocent,&#8221; but because of the injustices of Apartheid, develops into a more radical and violent dissenter than her husband.  Script wise, the development and understanding of Winnie&#8217;s character would have certainly benefited from a longer running time.The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital HD Ultraviolet combo package from Anchor Bay Entertainment has several extras, including audio commentary by director Justin Chadwick, a documentary, &#34;Mandela: The Leader You Know, The Man You Didn&#8217;t,&#34; plus other &#8220;Behind the Scenes&#8221; featurettes.

1680821,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00GSBQ2HU,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","This biopic traces Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela from his days as a young attorney in the late 1940's until his election as president of South Africa in 1994.  As the apartheid white minority government began an even more oppressive regime, the country's native majority begin to protest.  Often in large crowds but always peaceful.  When the government began to crack down on the protests, their violence increased, eventually leading to shooting non-violent protestors, including children.Mandela (Idris Elba), along with a handful of others, become leaders in the African National Congress.  Ultimately they retaliate against the government with their own brand of violence.  Mandela and his cohorts are eventually caught and imprisoned for life, initially on a remote island off the coast.  Nelson's wife Winnie (Naomie Harris) is imprisoned herself for many months as the government increases their oppression.Much of the film revolves around Mandela's years in prison where he begins to believe that peaceful means will eventually win out.  On the other hand, Winnie's hatred of the government fuels continued violent resistance.  Director Justin Chadwick (""The Other Boleyn Girl""), with a screenplay by William Nicholson based on Mandela's autobiography, does a commendable job providing scope and substance of Mandela's adult life which included many years behind bars.  You can pick up where this film left off with 2009's ""Invictus"" if you want a double feature.  Elba's performance deserves more accolades than he received during award season.  He is very effective as the great world leader.The Blu ray transfer comes from Anchor Bay and it's terrific.  It comes in 1080p resolution with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is consistent throughout with just a hint of grain.  Colors are excellent and range from the opulent settings of the presidential home to the deplorable conditions in the slums.  Detail is excellent as exemplified in much of the clothing and facial close-ups.  There is nothing to complain about.  Ditto the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  This soundtrack is perfectly balanced giving the viewer a sense of immersion within the film itself.  Natural sounds like wind, rain storms and animal sounds are perfectly staged.  Dialog is properly focused upfront.  Overall an excellent job.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.

1680824,AARHFHP17QFNG,B00GSBQ2HU,"Music Lover ""Peace. Love. Happiness.""","[0, 1]","I understand that it can be a challenge to cover the complexities of a movement that changes the course of life for people (politics, individual idiosyncratic nature of people, and relationships, etc.) because everything is important to know and in the interest of time and money and creative flow important aspects and people are often left out of movies and things are added that may or may not have been proven to have occurred.How people viewed Madiba, Winnie, the ANC or any other important figure in this movement is varied.  Although, I find it interesting that the oppressed are often called terrorists when they fight back.  I was not there so I cannot attest to whether or not they were terrorists, but history has shown us all that they were certainly unjustly terrorized. As for the complexities of it all, I am not much interested in that debate. They called Dr. MLK, Jr, a communist too for wanting to be treated humanely and with equality.As for the script, I dreaded watching this movie because like 12 Years A Slave I thought it would be hard to watch and parts of the movie are hard to swallow (like children dying), but to me it was a better life story because it resulted in a huge triumph to some extent.  I would not say it was a feel good movie but I felt better in the end (even if I already knew the result). This movie made me question whether or not I would have been a victim of violence or if I would have been brave enough to fight back. I certainly would have been angry.  I reflected on what it would would have felt like to be in their shoes-to be killed simply for not having a ""pass"" on me as I walked the streets of my own neighborhood; to have my child's murder ignored because the whites considered blacks to be animals and because the law/justice was less important than the power and terrorism of the white police and militia who were supposed to be peacekeepers; to be a mother who loses her innocent child to a police bullet; to be a family member of someone who was suspected of being a traitor to the ANC and set on fire; to be tortured like Winnie by police and broken to the point of hating white people and to be a white person attacked by angry mobs of South Africans as the social and political climate began to clash.  If the whites were scared of black retaliation, it is because they knew that their treatment of them warranted such a response (they would reap what had been sown over all of those years).  In other words, they knew what they (citizens and the government alike)were doing and allowing to occur was morally and legally unjust and they would be held accountable for the outcome. History repeats itself in this way-the oppressed always rise up eventually.  Mandela and the others were brave souls willing to die for their freedom.  That is what I reflected on as a viewer.  Still I had more questions at the end of the movie that need to be researched and answered.I thought this movie did its job of pointing out a time in history that left a stain on the existence of mankind. Even if you are not a history or political whiz kid, you get the point it serves up.  Even if Mandela was guilty of doing heinous crimes, like so many oppressed who are first angry during their revolt, he realized that to hate those who oppressed him would only consume him and make him no better than them.  That is always a powerful statement. After all, we cannot move forward without the help and outcry for justice coming from others (locally or internationally).  This film powerfully illustrated to me that once things come together (a series of unjust and criminal actions, the right timing, the right technology, and the placement of the right people and influential leaders) change becomes inevitable.I thought the acting was superb. The movie was over 2 hours long but it did not feel like it to me (maybe because I was cooking while I watched it), but I actually enjoyed this movie more than 12 Years A Slave.

1680826,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00GSBQ2HU,Paul Allaer,"[3, 5]","""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" (2013 release from South Africa; 139 min.) is the movie interpretation of Nelson Manela's 1995 autobiography of the same name. An introductory voice-over from Mandela (played by Idris Elba) stating the ""my father had given me the name troublemaker"" is never explained nor explored. and instead we are almost immediately thrown into Mandela's private law practice as a 24 yr. old in Johannesburg in 1942. So much for understanding Mandela's background or upbringing. The movie provides a parallel chronicle of Mandela's family life and political rise. Even though controversial for much of his life (up until becoming the beloved elder statesman in the early 90s), there is only one hint in the entire movie of Mandela as less than a saint (when we seen him cheating on his first wife and then beating her when denying the affair). The movie dutifully documents the 27 year prison term, and Mandela's subsequent release in 1990 and becoming South Africa's President in 1994.Couple of comments: first and foremost, given the immense popularity of Nelson Mandela and his incredible life story, I was surprised how little emotional pull this movie has, despite its noble intentions. It simply came across as a by-the-numbers biopic without much cohesion or vision. The only time I felt emotionally connected/involved in the movie was when Mandela, then in prison on Robben Island, gets a visit from his now 16 yr. old daughter, whom he last saw when she was 5. Second, I couldn't help but be struck by the fact that every single white person (man and women) in the entire movie up until near the very end is portrayed as an abusive fascist pig, and I do mean EVERY SINGLE ONE. Third, let's give proper credit to the acting performance of British actor Idris Elba, portraying Mandela over a timespan of 5 decades. It is near impossible to portray such an iconic figure with credibility but Elba somehow manages. Fourth, without being disrespectful, I can only imagine the imaginary high-fives that took place at The Weinstein Company, given the timing of Mandela's passing away, literally within a week of the movie's official release, thereby significantly increasing the attention to this movie. Harvey Weinstein couldn't have scripted it or timed it better himself. Lastly, there is a bunch of great African music throughout the movie, as well as more 'traditional' songs like Bob Marley's cover of ""War"" and U2's new song, ""Ordinary Love"", which over the movie's closing credits (the soundtrack is available here on Amazon for anyone interested).The movie came out 2 weeks ago here in Cincinnati but due to the holidays I only had a chance to go see it this weekend. The late matinee screening where I saw this at was not particularly well attended, and given the less that robust word of mouth this movie has generated, and the apparent lack of Oscar potential but for Elba's performance, I don't see this movie becoming the box office hit that one might've expected from a movie like this. Bottom line: ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" is noble and well intended, but regretfully falls short of expectations and feels like ""just another"" by-the-numbers biopic that fails to surprise or captivate.",4,3.5 stars... noble and well-intended but ultimately by-the-numbers biopic,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,3228,"['Mandela', 'Long', 'Walk', 'Freedom', '2013', 'release', 'South', 'Africa', '139', 'min', 'movie', 'interpretation', 'Nelson', 'Manela', '1995', 'autobiography', 'same', 'name', 'introductory', 'voice-over', 'Mandela', 'played', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'stating', 'father', 'had', 'given', 'name', 'troublemaker', 'never', 'explained', 'explored', 'instead', 'are', 'almost', 'immediately', 'thrown', 'Mandela', 'private', 'law', 'practice', '24', 'yr.', 'old', 'Johannesburg', '1942', 'So', 'much', 'understanding', 'Mandela', 'background', 'upbringing', 'movie', 'parallel', 'chronicle', 'Mandela', 'family', 'life', 'political', 'rise', 'Even', 'controversial', 'much', 'life', 'becoming', 'beloved', 'elder', 'statesman', 'early', '90s', 'only', 'one', 'hint', 'entire', 'movie', 'Mandela', 'less', 'saint', 'when', 'seen', 'cheating', 'first', 'wife', 'then', 'beating', 'when', 'denying', 'affair', 'movie', 'dutifully', 'documents', '27', 'year', 'prison', 'term', 'Mandela', 'subsequent', 'release', '1990', 'becoming', 'South', 'Africa', 'President', '1994.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'given', 'immense', 'popularity', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'incredible', 'life', 'story', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'little', 'emotional', 'pull', 'movie', 'noble', 'intentions', 'simply', 'came', 'by-the-numbers', 'biopic', 'much', 'cohesion', 'vision', 'only', 'time', 'felt', 'emotionally', 'connected/involved', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Mandela', 'then', 'prison', 'Robben', 'Island', 'visit', 'now', '16', 'yr.', 'old', 'daughter', 'whom', 'last', 'saw', 'when', 'was', '5', 'Second', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'struck', 'fact', 'single', 'white', 'person', 'man', 'women', 'entire', 'movie', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'portrayed', 'abusive', 'fascist', 'pig', 'do', 'mean', 'EVERY', 'SINGLE', 'ONE', 'Third', 'let', 'give', 'proper', 'credit', 'acting', 'performance', 'British', 'actor', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'portraying', 'Mandela', 'timespan', '5', 'decades', 'near', 'impossible', 'portray', 'such', 'iconic', 'figure', 'credibility', 'Elba', 'somehow', 'Fourth', 'being', 'disrespectful', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'imaginary', 'high-fives', 'took', 'place', 'Weinstein', 'Company', 'given', 'timing', 'Mandela', 'passing', 'away', 'literally', 'week', 'movie', 'official', 'release', 'thereby', 'significantly', 'increasing', 'attention', 'movie', 'Harvey', 'Weinstein', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'scripted', 'timed', 'better', 'Lastly', 'bunch', 'great', 'African', 'music', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'more', ""'traditional"", 'songs', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'cover', 'War', 'U2', 'new', 'song', 'Ordinary', 'Love', 'movie', 'closing', 'credits', 'soundtrack', 'available', 'here', 'Amazon', 'anyone', 'interested', '.The', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '2', 'weeks', 'ago', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'due', 'holidays', 'only', 'had', 'chance', 'go', 'see', 'weekend', 'late', 'matinee', 'screening', 'where', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'well', 'attended', 'given', 'less', 'robust', 'word', 'mouth', 'movie', 'generated', 'apparent', 'lack', 'Oscar', 'potential', 'Elba', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'becoming', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'one', 'might', ""'ve"", 'expected', 'movie', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Mandela', 'Long', 'Walk', 'Freedom', 'noble', 'well', 'intended', 'regretfully', 'short', 'expectations', 'feels', 'just', 'by-the-numbers', 'biopic', 'surprise', 'captivate']",Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

When his legal course doesn't work out he is forced to take more extreme measures. When these acts lead him to life imprisonment the guards do all they can to break him. His resolve continues to grow and eventually he becomes the face of hope and change. Before I started this movie I have to admit I was expecting it to be a little long and boring (it's almost 2 and 1/2 hours). I really liked the Winnie Mandela movie but sat down expecting to have to struggle through this. I was wrong. While the movie did drag in a few spots I have to say it did seem to movie pretty fast and kept me interested the entire time. The one flaw with this movie to me is that it seemed to not show how brutal and rough he had it while in prison, but I don't think that was the point of the movie anyway. After watching Morgan Freeman play Mandela my only thought was why would anyone else even try to portray him. Elba proved me wrong, he was great in this. While I did think that Winnie Mandela was a little better I did like this one much more then I expected to. Overall, Better then I was expecting and in my opinion a better movie then 12 Years A Slave.

Although he physically does not look like Mandela, he does emulate his stature and demeanor perfectly.  I also viewed the movie Winnie which gives the same story but from Winnie Mandela's viewpoint.
