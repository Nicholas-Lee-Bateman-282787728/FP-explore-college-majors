It's an inspiring family film without the sappiness. Elizabeth Taylor stars as a young girl determined to ride in the Grand National, despite the barriers she faces as a female. One could say it's a feminist film with a light touch. Mickey Rooney stars as her friend. Taylor brings her character to life, full of the passion that filled her life. There are beautiful scenes of the English countryside, with its fields and its cliffs.""National Velvet"" is a beautiful, inspirational equine film.

549040,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00004RFHM,Austin Somlo,"[0, 3]","Viewed: 10/12Rate: 510/12: In what should have been a great film, National Velvet comes off as a disappointment. Mostly it's due to Mickey Rooney and Donald Crisp. The way Mickey Rooney acted in National Velvet is like a pathetic midget trying to act like a forty year old man. The hammy acting is too hard for me to stomach. So does Angela Lansbury. For a nineteen old girl, she looks as if she is 45 years old.  On the other hand, Donald Crisp...oy vey! Couldn't he be less pessimistic? He ruined the film for me. Finally, the real point of the film...the Grand National. It's just so little of it but too much of Mickey Rooney tugging on the guy who cares only for himself. Better editing there is much desired please. Now, for the best parts of the film, obviously the film is all Anne Revere and Elizabeth Taylor. They really do an outstanding job of acting and bring the best out of a what should have been an excellent film. It's just a pity. I've not seen another child actress to act this great as Elizabeth Taylor has in National Velvet. She reminds me of the female version of Lord Fauntleroy. Anne Revere deservingly wins the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. That is a good performance as any and brings the meaning to why Velvet Brown does what she did. But you know, I see that scene on the bed where Velvet does this horse practicing thing with ropes; it seems to be very sexually suggestive. Meanwhile, looking at the Grand National, these scenes are spectacular, much in lines of Ben-Hur's chariot race. They also looked very real as the jockeys and their horses took a nasty spill jumping over these fences. Of course, the cinematography of the film is a can't miss. All in all, I'm just disappointed with the overall results of National Velvet.",3,Please Spare Me of Mickey and Donald.,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",2012,1765,"['Viewed', '10/12Rate', '510/12', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'National', 'Velvet', 'off', 'disappointment', 'Mostly', 'due', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'way', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'acted', 'National', 'Velvet', 'pathetic', 'midget', 'trying', 'act', 'forty', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'hammy', 'acting', 'too', 'hard', 'stomach', 'So', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'nineteen', 'old', 'girl', '45', 'years', 'old', 'other', 'hand', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'vey', 'Could', ""n't"", 'be', 'less', 'pessimistic', 'ruined', 'film', 'Finally', 'real', 'point', 'film', 'Grand', 'National', 'just', 'so', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'tugging', 'guy', 'who', 'only', 'Better', 'editing', 'much', 'desired', 'please', 'Now', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'obviously', 'film', 'Anne', 'Revere', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'really', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'acting', 'bring', 'best', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'film', 'just', 'pity', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'child', 'actress', 'act', 'great', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'National', 'Velvet', 'female', 'version', 'Lord', 'Fauntleroy', 'Anne', 'Revere', 'deservingly', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'good', 'performance', 'meaning', 'why', 'Velvet', 'Brown', 'what', 'did', 'know', 'see', 'scene', 'bed', 'where', 'Velvet', 'horse', 'practicing', 'thing', 'ropes', 'be', 'very', 'sexually', 'suggestive', 'Meanwhile', 'looking', 'Grand', 'National', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'much', 'lines', 'Ben-Hur', 'chariot', 'race', 'also', 'looked', 'very', 'real', 'jockeys', 'horses', 'took', 'nasty', 'spill', 'jumping', 'fences', 'course', 'cinematography', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', ""'m"", 'just', 'disappointed', 'overall', 'results', 'National', 'Velvet']",N/A
549041,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00004RFHM,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","This was Elizabeth Taylor's first starring role. She was playing a girl of 12, and may have been as much as a year or two older, at most. To tell you how old it is, Angela Lansbury plays her teen-age sister! Donald Crisp, great British character actor, played her father, and Mickey Rooney played the ex-jockey and trainer who help her prepare for the Grand National. (That's why she's called ""National Velvet."")Velvet Brown is just plain crazy about horses. There's a very suggestive scene where she's in bed with two ropes over her big toes, using them as reins and galloping laying on the bed. So when a neighbor gets tired of paying for the damage caused by his new gelding every time he jumps the fence and runs through the town, he raffles him off. Predictably, Velvet wins him. She names him Pie because the neighbor referred to him as a wicked Pirate, but she said he was gentle. He is a very, very beautiful horse. (Warner Brothers gave him to Liz Taylor when they were done filming.) Since the Grand National is a steeplechase -- that is a race with jumps in it, lots of jumps -- the fact that Pie loves to jump fences is no problem at all.It comes down to the night before the race, and there's no jockey. (The reasons are a little complex plot developments; I'll leave them to tell you all about it.) So Mickey Rooney says he will ride, although plainly he has a phobia about it. But Velvet is determined to ride herself, and she does, and she wins. But she was injured, and when the doctor took off her shirt to examine her, he ratted to the racing commissioner that she was a girl. So she won the race, and the respect of all those racing fans, but not the prize money.It's a good movie in the standards of its day, and has historical significance due to its starring cast of young actors & actresses who went on to be famous. But it is pretty predictable, and more than a little corny. I'll give it three stars.",3,"Sadly Dated, But a Fine Piece of Movie History",1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,1926,"['was', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'was', 'playing', 'girl', '12', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'much', 'year', 'two', 'older', 'most', 'tell', 'how', 'old', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'teen-age', 'sister', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'great', 'British', 'character', 'actor', 'played', 'father', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'played', 'ex-jockey', 'trainer', 'who', 'help', 'prepare', 'Grand', 'National', 'why', 'called', 'National', 'Velvet', 'Velvet', 'Brown', 'just', 'plain', 'crazy', 'horses', 'very', 'suggestive', 'scene', 'where', 'bed', 'two', 'ropes', 'big', 'toes', 'using', 'reins', 'galloping', 'laying', 'bed', 'So', 'when', 'neighbor', 'tired', 'paying', 'damage', 'caused', 'new', 'gelding', 'time', 'fence', 'town', 'off', 'Predictably', 'Velvet', 'Pie', 'neighbor', 'referred', 'wicked', 'Pirate', 'said', 'was', 'gentle', 'very', 'very', 'beautiful', 'horse', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'gave', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'when', 'were', 'done', 'filming', 'Grand', 'National', 'steeplechase', 'race', 'jumps', 'lots', 'jumps', 'fact', 'Pie', 'jump', 'fences', 'problem', 'all.It', 'down', 'night', 'race', 'jockey', 'reasons', 'are', 'little', 'complex', 'plot', 'developments', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'tell', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'will', 'ride', 'plainly', 'phobia', 'Velvet', 'determined', 'ride', 'was', 'injured', 'when', 'doctor', 'took', 'off', 'shirt', 'examine', 'ratted', 'racing', 'commissioner', 'was', 'girl', 'won', 'race', 'respect', 'racing', 'fans', 'not', 'prize', 'money.It', 'good', 'movie', 'standards', 'day', 'historical', 'significance', 'due', 'starring', 'cast', 'young', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'went', 'be', 'famous', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'more', 'little', 'corny', ""'ll"", 'give', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

549044,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B00004RFHM,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","Elizabeth Taylor was 12 years old when this movie was made; it was her fifth screen role (two of which had been uncredited), and it catapulted her to a fame from which she's never slipped since.  Given some of the incidents of her adult life, it's refreshing to see what she was like in her innocent youth, but above all the story itself and the people in it are what make it a classic.Velvet Brown (Taylor) is one of the four children of Herbert (Donald Crisp), a butcher, and his wife Araminta (Anne Revere), who at the age of 20 swam the English Channel when nobody thought a woman could do such a thing.  Her oldest sister Edwina (Angela Lansbury) is beginning to focus on boys; her only brother Donald (Jackie Jenkins) collects insects and tells tall tales; her second sister Malvolia (Juanita Quigley) is a passionate canary fancier; and Velvet is in love with horses.  ""Every night I pray to God to send me horses..."" she says.  When she first sees the half-wild chestnut called ""the Pie,"" she's lost forever.  And when the Pie's owner decides to raffle him off, she wins--and, spurred on by the stories of the cynical young ex-jockey Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), whose father was her mother's trainer, she resolves to train the horse for racing.  She's no piker, either: the Pie will be entered in the Grand National, the greatest race in the world.Following closely the original bookNational Velvet, the movie doesn't gloss over the work involved in training the Pie to mind and bringing out his natural gifts as a jumper; and where it does depart from the novel (chiefly in the character of Mi, who's rather different from Enid Bagnold's vision of him), it does so plausibly and well--part of the thrust of the tale lies in how seeing Velvet's faith and resolve helps Mi get past his bitterness.  (In case anyone wonders, the horse in the book is a ""piebald""--what we call in the U.S. a pinto--and that's where his odd name comes from.)  Young girls of Velvet's age, who all seem to be in love with horses, should especially enjoy it, but all families will find it a pleasant evening's watching, with nothing in it to object to.",4,A dream fulfilled,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,2136,"['Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'was', '12', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'fifth', 'screen', 'role', 'two', 'had', 'been', 'uncredited', 'catapulted', 'fame', 'never', 'slipped', 'Given', 'incidents', 'adult', 'life', 'refreshing', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'innocent', 'youth', 'story', 'people', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'classic.Velvet', 'Brown', 'Taylor', 'one', 'four', 'children', 'Herbert', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'butcher', 'wife', 'Araminta', 'Anne', 'Revere', 'who', 'age', '20', 'swam', 'English', 'Channel', 'when', 'nobody', 'thought', 'woman', 'could', 'do', 'thing', 'oldest', 'sister', 'Edwina', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'beginning', 'focus', 'boys', 'only', 'brother', 'Donald', 'Jackie', 'Jenkins', 'insects', 'tells', 'tall', 'tales', 'second', 'sister', 'Malvolia', 'Juanita', 'Quigley', 'passionate', 'canary', 'fancier', 'Velvet', 'love', 'horses', 'night', 'pray', 'God', 'send', 'horses', 'When', 'first', 'half-wild', 'chestnut', 'called', 'Pie', 'lost', 'forever', 'when', 'Pie', 'owner', 'raffle', 'off', 'spurred', 'stories', 'cynical', 'young', 'ex-jockey', 'Mi', 'Taylor', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'father', 'was', 'mother', 'trainer', 'train', 'horse', 'racing', 'piker', 'Pie', 'will', 'be', 'entered', 'Grand', 'National', 'greatest', 'race', 'world.Following', 'closely', 'original', 'bookNational', 'Velvet', 'movie', ""n't"", 'gloss', 'work', 'involved', 'training', 'Pie', 'mind', 'bringing', 'out', 'natural', 'gifts', 'jumper', 'where', 'depart', 'novel', 'chiefly', 'character', 'Mi', 'who', 'rather', 'different', 'Enid', 'Bagnold', 'vision', 'so', 'plausibly', 'well', 'part', 'thrust', 'tale', 'how', 'seeing', 'Velvet', 'faith', 'resolve', 'Mi', 'get', 'bitterness', 'case', 'anyone', 'wonders', 'horse', 'book', 'piebald', 'what', 'call', 'U.S.', 'pinto', 'where', 'odd', 'name', 'Young', 'girls', 'Velvet', 'age', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'love', 'horses', 'should', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'families', 'will', 'find', 'pleasant', 'evening', 'watching', 'nothing', 'object']",N/A

The movie is mostly set in Sewels, Sussex, England and stars a young Elizabeth Taylor as Velvet Brown who dreams of owning her own horse. On her way home from school, she meets a young drifter named Mi Taylor (played by Mickey Rooney) who looking for Velvet's mother. He had found Mrs. Brown's name and address in his late father's possessions.The Browns hire Mi to help out around their farm and at their store. They also allow him to sleep in the barn. Velvet and Mi become friends despite the fact that Mi hates horses as he use to be a jockey.A local farmer is raffling his horse ""Pirate"", because the horse is wild. The horse likes to get jump the fence and create chaos throughout the small village, practically putting the owner in debt. Despite the Browns rejections, Mi buys several raffles and gives them to Velvet and her siblings. To her luck, she wins the horse that she renames Pie.Velvet has great faith in Pie and wants to enter him into the Grand National. She talks Mi into helping her train Pie for the great race and her mother gives her 100 pounds to enter into the race.I've never really cared for watching horse racing movies, or horse moves in general, butNational Velvetwas under five dollars and has a great cast (It even has the dog Daisy from the Blondie movies as the Browns' family dog.), so I decided to give it a try. Considering the age of the movie, the film looks great on DVD! Elizabeth Taylor gives a great performance as Velvet, the girl who loves horses, but my favorite character was Mi Taylor played by Mickey Rooney, as he is a flawed character. Several times he has a great amount of money in his hands, but he cares for the Browns and he doesn't want to disappoint them. The running time is a little over two hours, but I was so into the movie that it felt less than that.

When it was released on a DVD, my wife and I sat down and really enjoyed this fabulous film.  We didn't find that it was made poorly.  Just the opposite.  It had all the earmarks of a fine film - joy, suspense, love, action, drama, comedy, and the like.  We didn't find we liked Mickey Rooney's character at first, but he grew on us, and Elizabeth Taylor was simply marvelous, as were her parents.  Thoe whole ensemble cast was terrific.  And then we get to the horse race and that whole business.  I can't say enough about it!!  There's a scene in the film where Mickey Rooney tells a tale to the young boy, and it's done without any fanfare of the what the future might hold, but had there ever been plans of making a movie called ""The Black Stallion,"" then this little scene in this film was the precursor.A fine family film!!

549055,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00004RFHM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","So have you heard of: Marilyn Monroe's sixth toe? Or Marisa Tomei's fake Oscar win? The cryogenically frozen Walt Disney? Or Richard Gere and that unfortunate gerbil? Okay, what about this Hollywood urban legend: In 1943, when informed that she was too small and looked too young for the part of Velvet Brown in the upcoming film, NATIONAL VELVET, 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor willed herself into growing three inches taller in the next three months. And whether thru a regimen of furious exercise and a strict diet or from reportedly hanging from a bar to stretch her spine, she really did grow those three inches in three months, and so she got the part. NATIONAL VELVET, adapted from Enid Bagnold's much-loved novel and released in 1944, would plant Liz Taylor on the road to cinematic immortality.She is luminous and so ingratiating as the 12-year-old Velvet Brown, a child impossibly passionate about horses. So imagine her ecstatic response when she wins the unruly gelding, the Pie, in a town lottery. With the sometimes disgruntled tutoring of embittered road tramp (and former ex-jockey) Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), Velvet tames her wild horse and then entertains big dreams of entering the Pie in the grueling Grand National race, never mind the hundred to one odds.For NATIONAL VELVET Elizabeth Taylor was this close to garnering a Special Oscar - one of those Academy Juvenile Awards - except that Peggy Ann Garner, who was so fantastic in A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, trumped her. Mickey Rooney effectively veers away from his cheerful, wholesome image to play the surly, sort of fishy Mi Taylor. Mi Taylor, you see, exhibits a certain, to borrow Mr. Brown's words, ""watchful sharpness"" about him. It's a jarring moment, eyeballing a shady Mickey Rooney. The best surprise, though, is Anne Revere's captivating performance as Velvet's wise, understanding mother. Mrs. Brown once was a girl who dared to live out her dream and then had the practical sense to move on. So she understands her daughter's naive ambitions very well and she indulges them, but with a caveat. She cautions her daughter: ""Remember, Velvet, it will have to last you all the rest of your life."" The pitch-perfect Anne Revere deservedly won that year's Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.NATIONAL VELVET is a classic; it's a timeless family film, one that I never tire of watching each year. It doesn't take place during the holidays, and yet there's a warm holiday glow to it. It's sentimental and nostalgic and hearkens back to an England set during the late 1920s. And whenever I drop in at my local barbershop and the chatter inevitably cycles back toward the best horses in cinema, the Pie is always well represented. He ranks right up there with the Black Stallion and Silver and the 'Biscuit. If you're a fan of MURDER SHE WROTE, note that Angela Lansbury has a supporting role as Velvet's oldest sister. If you're a fan of movie butlers of the 1930s, perennial manservant Arthur Treacher steps out of his usual role and has an amusing bit as a race patron.You may be curious to know that, in 1978, a sequel to NATIONAL VELVET was released, titled INTERNATIONAL VELVET (Four Film Favorites: Classic Horse Films (Black Beauty / The Story of Seabiscuit / National Velvet / International Velvet)). It has the suddenly orphaned American girl, Sarah Brown (Tatum O'Neal), coming to live with her British aunt Velvet (Nanette Newman) and eventually competing in an Olympic equestrian event. It's a solid sequel, but, no, Liz Taylor isn't in it.",5,"""You think a horse of yours can win the Grand National?

549057,AH1M9A3JTV7C3,B00004RFHM,Ian Muldoon,"[9, 12]","On a fine sunny day we see a boy walking, jauntily with a spring in his step, along a dirt lane whistling a happy tune. The lane is bordered by  carefully planted shrubs which form a hedge on each side. In the distance  we see an expanse of water. The titles come up in bright yellow followed by  the message &quot; ENGLAND IN THE LATE TWENTIES - A LONG TIME AGO IN A  SPINNING WORLD&quot;. The boy comes to a sign and a fork in the road and  ahead is visible a long stretch of beach, a blue sea with white surf  breaking on white sand and the hints of settlement in the form of a  village. He sits and rests, wiping his forehead. Cut to a school hall  resembling a church building with ivy on its exterior, an oak at its side  and children joyously spilling out of its door. Cut to interior with a  class of girls standing in their places, in order of size behind their  desks from front to back, in chorus singing a ditty about &quot;Happy,  happy holiday etc&quot;. Elizabeth Taylor (as &quot;Velvet&quot;)stands out  in the class, in the middle, with her jet black hair, violet eyes, red  dress and white trim, and her braces; and then at the front of the group  when the children rush to the front to hear the words of wisdom from the  teacher showing great affection for this seminal authority figure. The  light, the hope, that shines from Velvet's face is a marvel to witness. My  love for this film rests much on the contrast between the theme of the free  spirit versus the ordered life and the benefits that are evident in both  but the difficulty indeed impossibility of having both at the same time.  The horse &quot;Pi&quot; symbolises, like Mickey Rooney (as Mi Taylor),  that free spirit, and Elizabeth Taylor(as Velvet Brown) tries to  &quot;civilise&quot; or at least, train, both. With the horse, she succeeds  through love. She succeeds up to a point with Mi. Much of the film's  tension comes through the conflict between authority (of the father, the  mother, the police,etc)and the likes of Mi and the horse which at one point  runs wild destroying various items within the village including some  carefully cultivated flowers in a private garden. I feel also that Mickey  may have represented the free spirit of the American whose presence at this  time in England at the time of this film's production (1944) was manifest  and somewhat controversial especially regarding the attractiveness(economic  and spiritual)of the American Servicemen to the English women. When Velvet  wins the race posing as a boy jockey, it's her one victory and the  implication is that her life will take its expected path - she rejects  Hollywood offers following her astounding victory, for life in the village  with her wonderful family. Pi is taken out of racing to be free to roam  albeit within the confines of his enclosure by the sea. Mi returns to his  travels where the world itself is his home - when Velvet first meets him  she asks &quot;Where should you be?&quot; He replies &quot;Anyplace my feet  take me.&quot; When she tells him that she has two sisters and a brother  and her father is a butcher, she asks him what he's got and he replies  &quot; The whole world. My Pa left it to me.&quot;  There is tension  between the Romantic and the Practical - in the beginning it seems Mi is  filled with practical no nonsense information about horses, food, travel,  money whilst Velvet is filled with romantic notions, hope and idealism. In  the end, its Mi who continues to travel on his life's journey while Velvet  decides to opt for the sensible comforts of her stable village life. Little  does she know, but that her world, and ours, has changed for ever. It's the  real beginning of the rise of the United States of America. There is a  certain poignancy about the film, the knowledge that one kind of life is  ending and another beginning.  In terms of craft, acting, production  values, direction, it seems to me to be faultless. It doesn't deserve to be  shunted off as a &quot;family film&quot;. It's superior by far to GONE WITH  THE WIND for example. It deserves to be spoken of in the same breath as  WIZARD OF OZ, THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, etc",5,Free spirit meets civilised village life - a faultless film,967161600,"08 25, 2000",2000,4171,"['fine', 'sunny', 'day', 'see', 'boy', 'walking', 'jauntily', 'spring', 'step', 'dirt', 'lane', 'whistling', 'happy', 'tune', 'lane', 'bordered', 'carefully', 'planted', 'shrubs', 'form', 'hedge', 'side', 'distance', 'see', 'expanse', 'water', 'titles', 'come', 'up', 'bright', 'yellow', 'followed', 'message', 'quot', 'IN', 'THE', 'LATE', 'TWENTIES', 'LONG', 'TIME', 'AGO', 'IN', 'A', 'SPINNING', 'WORLD', 'quot', 'boy', 'sign', 'fork', 'road', 'ahead', 'visible', 'long', 'stretch', 'beach', 'blue', 'sea', 'white', 'surf', 'breaking', 'white', 'sand', 'hints', 'settlement', 'form', 'village', 'rests', 'wiping', 'forehead', 'Cut', 'school', 'hall', 'resembling', 'church', 'building', 'ivy', 'exterior', 'oak', 'side', 'children', 'joyously', 'spilling', 'door', 'Cut', 'interior', 'class', 'girls', 'standing', 'places', 'order', 'size', 'desks', 'front', 'back', 'chorus', 'singing', 'ditty', 'quot', 'Happy', 'happy', 'holiday', 'etc', 'quot', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'quot', 'Velvet', 'quot', 'out', 'class', 'middle', 'jet', 'black', 'hair', 'violet', 'eyes', 'red', 'dress', 'white', 'trim', 'braces', 'then', 'front', 'group', 'when', 'children', 'rush', 'front', 'hear', 'words', 'wisdom', 'teacher', 'showing', 'great', 'affection', 'seminal', 'authority', 'figure', 'light', 'hope', 'Velvet', 'face', 'marvel', 'witness', 'love', 'film', 'much', 'contrast', 'theme', 'free', 'spirit', 'ordered', 'life', 'benefits', 'are', 'evident', 'difficulty', 'indeed', 'impossibility', 'having', 'same', 'time', 'horse', 'quot', 'Pi', 'quot', 'symbolises', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Mi', 'Taylor', 'free', 'spirit', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Velvet', 'Brown', 'quot', 'civilise', 'quot', 'least', 'train', 'horse', 'love', 'up', 'point', 'Mi', 'Much', 'film', 'tension', 'conflict', 'authority', 'father', 'mother', 'police', 'etc', 'likes', 'Mi', 'horse', 'one', 'point', 'wild', 'destroying', 'various', 'items', 'village', 'including', 'carefully', 'cultivated', 'flowers', 'private', 'garden', 'feel', 'also', 'Mickey', 'may', 'have', 'represented', 'free', 'spirit', 'American', 'presence', 'time', 'England', 'time', 'film', 'production', '1944', 'was', 'manifest', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'especially', 'regarding', 'attractiveness', 'economic', 'spiritual', 'American', 'Servicemen', 'English', 'women', 'When', 'Velvet', 'race', 'posing', 'boy', 'jockey', 'one', 'victory', 'implication', 'life', 'will', 'take', 'expected', 'path', 'Hollywood', 'offers', 'following', 'astounding', 'victory', 'life', 'village', 'wonderful', 'family', 'Pi', 'taken', 'racing', 'be', 'free', 'roam', 'confines', 'enclosure', 'sea', 'Mi', 'travels', 'where', 'world', 'home', 'when', 'Velvet', 'first', 'quot', 'Where', 'should', 'be', 'quot', 'quot', 'Anyplace', 'feet', 'take', 'me.', 'quot', 'When', 'two', 'sisters', 'brother', 'father', 'butcher', 'what', 'got', 'quot', 'whole', 'world', 'Pa', 'left', 'me.', 'quot', 'tension', 'Romantic', 'Practical', 'beginning', 'Mi', 'filled', 'practical', 'nonsense', 'information', 'horses', 'food', 'travel', 'money', 'whilst', 'Velvet', 'filled', 'romantic', 'notions', 'hope', 'idealism', 'end', 'Mi', 'who', 'travel', 'life', 'journey', 'Velvet', 'opt', 'sensible', 'comforts', 'stable', 'village', 'life', 'Little', 'know', 'world', 'changed', 'ever', 'real', 'beginning', 'rise', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'certain', 'poignancy', 'film', 'knowledge', 'one', 'kind', 'life', 'ending', 'beginning', 'terms', 'craft', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'direction', 'be', 'faultless', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'shunted', 'off', 'quot', 'family', 'film', 'quot', 'superior', 'far', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'example', 'be', 'spoken', 'same', 'breath', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'THE', 'PHILADELPHIA', 'STORY', 'etc']",N/A

He happens to know about horses and helps Velvet train The Pie.  They end up entering the horse in the most prestigious steeplechase event in the world, the Grand National.  The rest I'll keep a secret!The story is so heart warming and special... the characters are funny and sympathetic.  The acting is superb!  A very young Angela Landsbury has a part as Velvet's beautiful older sister!  And the race at the end is just brilliant - you really can't help but cheer The Pie on - to this day I find myself standing up and screaming along as he is leaping over those fences!The movie followed the basic story of the book, but as with most movies they had to leave a lot out.  The book is a classic in its own right though, and well worth reading if you haven't already.  The story is so exciting and fun, its one I will never forget.  I highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you're not a horse fanatic. :)",5,Top Notch!,1071100800,"12 11, 2003",2003,1394,"['classic', 'horse', 'movies', 'STILL', 'great', 'today', 'have', 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'still', 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'story', 'basically', 'poor', 'horse-crazy', 'girl', 'named', 'Velvet', 'Brown', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'up', 'unruly', 'talented', 'horse', 'Pie', 'known', 'jumping', 'pastures', 'being', 'nuisance', 'young', 'boy', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'up', 'staying', 'family', 'awhile', 'help', 'out', 'family', 'business', 'know', 'horses', 'Velvet', 'train', 'Pie', 'end', 'up', 'entering', 'horse', 'most', 'prestigious', 'steeplechase', 'event', 'world', 'Grand', 'National', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'secret', 'story', 'so', 'heart', 'warming', 'special', 'characters', 'are', 'funny', 'sympathetic', 'acting', 'superb', 'very', 'young', 'Angela', 'Landsbury', 'part', 'Velvet', 'beautiful', 'older', 'sister', 'race', 'end', 'just', 'brilliant', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheer', 'Pie', 'day', 'find', 'standing', 'up', 'screaming', 'along', 'leaping', 'fences', 'movie', 'followed', 'basic', 'story', 'book', 'most', 'movies', 'had', 'leave', 'lot', 'book', 'classic', 'own', 'right', 'well', 'worth', 'reading', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'story', 'so', 'exciting', 'fun', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'highly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'horse', 'fanatic']",N/A

549067,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004RFHM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[15, 19]","Somehow I never got around to see this movie until I was 40 years old.  I  guess it was because I was never really an Elizabeth Taylor fan, although I  have always enjoyed &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;Who's  Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;  But I was at the library and I had always  heard good things about it and so I checked in out and took it home and  watched it and feel in love with it.The plot line involving Mike (Mickey  Rooney) starts off as somewhat melodramatic, the standard story (literarly  in this case) of the guy who has to get back on the horse.  The twist is  that when he does our young heroine has decided she is the only one who can  ride the Pie to victory.  The twist is the Rooney achieves his victory  without winning (anticipating &quot;Rocky&quot; in that regard when you  stop and think about it).The focus of the film is on Taylor and Rooney,  but the heart and soul of the film is the relationship between Velvet and  her mother.  Anne Reeve won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her  portrayal of the mother, and while her scenes with husband Donald Crip are  small gems scattered throughout the film (they call each other &quot;Mr.  Brown&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot; and you can tell how much they love  each other every time they do it), it is the scenes with her daughter that  bring home the film.Mrs. Brown uses the money from her swimming the  channel to fund Velvet's dream of racing the pie in the Grand National.  But for Velvet the payoff is not when she wins the race and becames a front  page story, but when she arrives home and immediately runs to her mother  and says, &quot;We won, Mother.  We won.&quot;  Her mother already knows.  All of England knows.  But all that mattered was telling her mother.  It is  a neat scene and an ellegant payoff to the film, more so than her running  off to fetch make Mike.This 1944 film was directed by Clarence Brown and  is based on the novel by Enid Bagnold.

It's almost as old as Keith Richards but its age barely shows. You'd have to be hopelessly hard and bitter not to get caught up in Velvet Brown's determination to enter the crazy, talented horse she wins in a raffle in the Grand National, the greatest steeplechase in the world. Yes, it's from a more innocent time, but there is plenty of humor for adults to enjoy. The acting is uniformly excellent. Mickey Rooney has one of his finest roles. Ann Revere and Donald Crisp delight as Velvet's parents. A very young Angela Lansbury plays Velvet's boy-crazy sister. Arthur Treacher of fish-and-chips shop fame plays a race fan. Elizabeth Taylor was never more vibrant, passionate and lovely. (She probably should have stuck with horses.) Unfortunately, with World War II raging in England in 1944, the filming had to be done in California, where the ever-present sunshine undermines the credibility of the English village setting, but that's a minor quibble. For its era, the film's depiction of what girls and women can accomplish with work and determination is remarkable. Highly recommended for the whole family.Humane/animal rights activists take note: The ASPCA did not monitor animal action in films 64 years ago, and CGI did not exist. Many horses take some nasty falls during the Grand National. I have never been able to find out, but it would not surprise me if some became permanently lame or had to be euthanized after filming was complete.

This is going to be a big day for Velvet.  On her way home she meets Mike Taylor (Mickey Rooney) and sees a horse which she names the Pi (short for the Pirate).Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) was a famous channel swimmer.  Mike's father was her coach.  Mr. Brown (Donald Crisp) is the town butcher and hires Mike to work for him.When the Pi escapes and runs rampant through town, his owner decides to raffle him off.  Velvet gets the notion that she will win the horse; she's arranged it with God.  When she loses the raffle, she is heart broken.  She is so heart broken that she sees the whole town bringing her the Pi.  But it's true.  The number drawn hadn't been sold and the next number was Velvet's.Then Velvet gets the idea to enter the Pi into the Grand National Steeplechase.  And finally, she decides to race the horse herself.This was Liz's second starring role - fourth film.  You could see from this her true charisma was showing early on.  This was also an early role for Angela Lansbury.  This film she played a girl about her own age, a rarity for Lansbury.  Rooney was the veteran.  This was his 50th film.  But this was Mickey in transition.  He wanted to get away of being Andy Hardy, Judy Garland's boyfriend or the younger brother of the star of a film.  All proved they had the talent to go far.The rest of the cast included many of MGM's greatest character actors.  But it was Anne Revere as the center rock of the Brown family that won the Oscar.  She gave a great performance that would be the standard and copied to this day.The production values are the best of MGM's toughest standards.

Who knows if life was ever this sweet?  I hope so.The cast is superb and we are lucky to have these special people still living.  I agree that a DVD should be released with comments from the amazing Mickey Rooney, and Liz Taylor.  Angela Lansbury, too...wow, what longevity in the business.Mickey is billed as the star and he is really wonderful here as the down on his luck drifter who battles his own demons to come out strong and good to help Velvet win the National.

For serious film critics, a few weaknesses follow.The little boy in this movie is unnecessary. He doesn't add anything to it. He's loud, annoying, and has nothing to say. He's not cute; he's just annoying. And what's the purpose of his bigger sister painting his toenails with red nail polish?!Mrs. Brown is tremendously overrated. There was so little emotional range in her role and it was not impressive acting. Winning an Oscar for it was absolutely ridiculous! If any actress in National Velvet should have got an Oscar it was Elizabeth Taylor.Mickey Rooney had a great performance, too.The relationship between Mr. Brown and Mrs. Brown and them always calling each other Mr. Brown and Mrs. Brown was supposed to be funny but it was grating.The Grand National scene itself, the climax of the movie, was poorly written and disappointing. The ex-jockey continuously asking what's going on was annoying and almost ruined the scene.The final shot of National Velvet could have been better.I like how this family movie had good themes for both children and parents.A lesson for parents in the story is if your child expresses her dream, be ready to run with it, and don't exploit her if she's successful.",4,"Classic 1940s Horse Movie for Girls in Color; Parents Can Enjoy, Too",1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,1285,"['Lots', 'like', 'love', 'wonderful', 'horse', 'movie', 'already', 'been', 'noted', 'serious', 'film', 'critics', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'follow.The', 'little', 'boy', 'movie', 'unnecessary', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'loud', 'annoying', 'nothing', 'say', 'not', 'cute', 'just', 'annoying', 'what', 'purpose', 'bigger', 'sister', 'painting', 'toenails', 'red', 'nail', 'polish', 'Mrs', 'Brown', 'tremendously', 'overrated', 'was', 'so', 'little', 'emotional', 'range', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'impressive', 'acting', 'Winning', 'Oscar', 'was', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'actress', 'National', 'Velvet', 'should', 'have', 'got', 'Oscar', 'was', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor.Mickey', 'Rooney', 'had', 'great', 'performance', 'too.The', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'always', 'calling', 'other', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'grating.The', 'Grand', 'National', 'scene', 'climax', 'movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'written', 'disappointing', 'ex-jockey', 'continuously', 'asking', 'what', 'going', 'was', 'annoying', 'almost', 'ruined', 'scene.The', 'final', 'shot', 'National', 'Velvet', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.I', 'how', 'family', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'themes', 'children', 'parents.A', 'lesson', 'parents', 'story', 'child', 'dream', 'be', 'ready', 'run', 'do', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'successful']",N/A
549092,A1C80B497LCYKA,B00004RFHM,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[4, 4]","National Velvet is one of the finest family films ever made, and it contains one of the most exciting races, perhaps second only to the chariot race in Ben-Hur. Directed by Clarence Brown (The Yearling, The White Cliffs Of Dover, Edison The Man), who was nominated for Best Director, and based upon Enid Bagnold's novel, it tells the story of a girl named Velvet Brown, who is in love with horses - portrayed passionately and innocently by Elizabeth Taylor. Her father, Mr. Brown - played with good-natured stubbornness by Donald Crisp - and mother, Mrs. Brown - infused with even-tempered wisdom and efficiency by Anne Revere, who won the Oscar for her performance - provide a lot of the entertainment with their constant and playful bantering. Her brother, Donald - played comically but with stone-faced seriousness by Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins - older sister Edwina - given typical teenage aloofness by Angela Lansbury - and younger sister Mally - made likable but somewhat forgettable by Juanita Quigley - round out the family.The real story is about the relationship between Velvet and a young itinerate named Mi - one of Mickey Rooney's most memorable performances. Mi's father knew the family, and now the son shows up on their doorstep with the idea of robbing them. But he changes his mind after realizing there is something about this family he would like to get to know. Velvet overwhelms him with her obsession over horses, especially since he dislikes them - apparently because of some bad experience. But he changes his mind when quite by chance she wins the county's finest stallion in a lottery. Mi realizes the horse's potential when he jumps a six foot wall, and helps Velvet train him for the Grand National - the most gruelling and dangerous steeplechase in terfdom, full of treacherous jumps and water hazards.Besides the nomination for director Clarence Brown and the win for actress Anne Revere, the film was also nominated for its lush cinematography and delightful art direction, and won for its masterful editing. Much of this is due to editor Robert Kern's handling of the race, which forms the climax of the film. Except for the chariot race in Ben-Hur, I don't think there has ever been a more realistically staged or exciting race in a film. The stunt work is incredible. It would be a miracle if no men or horses were injured, because they go over those jumps pall mall, sometimes landing, apparently, on their heads, and often piling up on each other. Kudos to the stunt people, horses and trainers.National Velvet warms and excites the heart, while leaving an impression of human nobility and spiritual values that will not soon be forgotten. And if someone isn't a horse lover at the end of this film, then there's no hope that they ever will be. Great directorial insight, intelligent writing, superb performances and top notch production values make this a small masterpiece.Waitsel Smith",5,"ONE OF FINEST FAMILY FILMS, ONE OF MOST EXCITING RACES",1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,2921,"['National', 'Velvet', 'one', 'finest', 'family', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'races', 'perhaps', 'second', 'only', 'chariot', 'race', 'Ben-Hur', 'Directed', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'Yearling', 'White', 'Cliffs', 'Dover', 'Edison', 'Man', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'based', 'Enid', 'Bagnold', 'novel', 'story', 'girl', 'named', 'Velvet', 'Brown', 'who', 'love', 'horses', 'portrayed', 'passionately', 'innocently', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'played', 'good-natured', 'stubbornness', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'infused', 'even-tempered', 'wisdom', 'efficiency', 'Anne', 'Revere', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'provide', 'lot', 'entertainment', 'constant', 'playful', 'bantering', 'brother', 'Donald', 'played', 'comically', 'stone-faced', 'seriousness', 'Jackie', ""'Butch"", 'Jenkins', 'older', 'sister', 'Edwina', 'given', 'typical', 'teenage', 'aloofness', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'younger', 'sister', 'Mally', 'made', 'likable', 'somewhat', 'forgettable', 'Juanita', 'Quigley', 'round', 'family.The', 'real', 'story', 'relationship', 'Velvet', 'young', 'itinerate', 'named', 'Mi', 'one', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Mi', 'father', 'knew', 'family', 'now', 'son', 'up', 'doorstep', 'idea', 'robbing', 'mind', 'realizing', 'something', 'family', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'know', 'Velvet', 'overwhelms', 'obsession', 'horses', 'especially', 'apparently', 'bad', 'experience', 'mind', 'when', 'quite', 'chance', 'county', 'finest', 'stallion', 'lottery', 'Mi', 'horse', 'potential', 'when', 'six', 'foot', 'wall', 'Velvet', 'train', 'Grand', 'National', 'most', 'gruelling', 'dangerous', 'steeplechase', 'terfdom', 'full', 'treacherous', 'jumps', 'water', 'hazards.Besides', 'nomination', 'director', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'win', 'actress', 'Anne', 'Revere', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'delightful', 'art', 'direction', 'won', 'masterful', 'editing', 'Much', 'due', 'editor', 'Robert', 'Kern', 'handling', 'race', 'climax', 'film', 'chariot', 'race', 'Ben-Hur', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'there', 'ever', 'been', 'more', 'realistically', 'staged', 'exciting', 'race', 'film', 'stunt', 'work', 'incredible', 'would', 'be', 'miracle', 'men', 'horses', 'were', 'injured', 'go', 'jumps', 'pall', 'mall', 'sometimes', 'landing', 'apparently', 'heads', 'often', 'piling', 'up', 'other', 'Kudos', 'stunt', 'people', 'horses', 'trainers.National', 'Velvet', 'warms', 'heart', 'leaving', 'impression', 'human', 'nobility', 'spiritual', 'values', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten', 'someone', ""n't"", 'horse', 'lover', 'end', 'film', 'then', 'hope', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'Great', 'directorial', 'insight', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'superb', 'performances', 'top', 'notch', 'production', 'values', 'make', 'small', 'masterpiece.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
