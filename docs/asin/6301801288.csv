268974,A2YK2MBP8KH1FD,6301801288,"A. Carey ""adamarket""","[6, 13]","I'm just getting back into Doctor Who courtesy of my three year old daughter who absolutely loves it. The first episode I really remember seeing was the Planet of the Spiders where Pertwee changed into Baker. Consequently, Tom Baker remains my firm favorite because he was really &quot;my&quot; Doctor Who.There was a fair amount of disappointment with the Five Doctors among my fellow 13 year olds when it came on British TV. Personally, I would have held off production once I learned Tom Baker wasn't available. The stand-in for Hartnell does a fantastic job and the idea of getting the five doctors together is enjoyable. It hails back to the famous Three Doctors episode, where the enemy was a renegade Timelord called Omega, I think.Utlimately, the entry is pretty weak. Every hallmark monster is thrown into the mix and the doctors crowd on stage cancelling each other out. Add in the side characters and you get a rare mess of a production. Ironically, the best thing I remember about this episode was a completely new creature, a lightening quick android who could throw out darts from the ends of his fingers. As I remember, he gives the Cybermen a run for their money.",2,A Big Disappointment in 1983,1011312000,"01 18, 2002",2002,1179,"[""'m"", 'just', 'getting', 'back', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'courtesy', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'absolutely', 'first', 'episode', 'really', 'remember', 'seeing', 'was', 'Planet', 'Spiders', 'where', 'Pertwee', 'changed', 'Baker', 'Consequently', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'firm', 'favorite', 'was', 'really', 'quot', 'quot', 'Doctor', 'Who.There', 'was', 'fair', 'amount', 'disappointment', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'fellow', '13', 'year', 'olds', 'when', 'came', 'British', 'TV', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'off', 'production', 'once', 'learned', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'stand-in', 'Hartnell', 'fantastic', 'job', 'idea', 'getting', 'five', 'doctors', 'together', 'enjoyable', 'back', 'famous', 'Three', 'Doctors', 'episode', 'where', 'enemy', 'was', 'renegade', 'Timelord', 'called', 'Omega', 'think.Utlimately', 'entry', 'pretty', 'weak', 'Every', 'hallmark', 'monster', 'thrown', 'mix', 'doctors', 'crowd', 'stage', 'cancelling', 'other', 'out', 'Add', 'side', 'characters', 'get', 'rare', 'mess', 'production', 'Ironically', 'best', 'thing', 'remember', 'episode', 'was', 'completely', 'new', 'creature', 'lightening', 'quick', 'android', 'who', 'could', 'throw', 'out', 'darts', 'ends', 'fingers', 'remember', 'Cybermen', 'run', 'money']",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS

Richard Hurnell(I think that's how you spell it) was pretty good, though nothing like William Hartnel.  Old compaignions made thier appearance as well, some cameo, some had major parts, though most of them seemed a little naive or silly.  Others, like Tegan, were a bit wiser.  Turlough did not have much of a part in Dr. Who as a whole.  He very seldom showed up in this, except inside the TARDIS.This special edition included scenes cut out in the original broadcast(originally broadcast in America anyway)  As for the special effects, they ruined them all!  The original release, had sharper more futuristic images for the Time Scouper and looked much better.  This ""enhanced"" version glossed it over with some kind of computer genorated blurry white thing and it is awful.  The TARDIS sequence was replaced with the same, cheapening the effect.  What were you thinking, BBC!However, the storyline is inhanced by the added scenes and adds to the continuity.  The Master's role was a bit weak in this story.  The Cybermen were [bad]!

It really was such an accomplishment to show all these former companions come in as well. At least it made sense. This new 5 Doctors is done very well. The added footage that was originally cut down due to time constraints when it originally aired, was nice to see the new stuff. The new effects as well was great to watch. It made this much more enjoyable to watch and relive. As I've probably seen this so many times, this new edition certainly made it worth watching again. I enjoyed all the cast and was fond of the opening too which put the first Dr., William Hartnell as an nostalgic touch. His replacement Richard Hurndall does well but I thought he was way too tall. All the other Doctors are great and Tom Baker's absence is missed. Wished he'd done it. The new ending of how everyone was sent home made a more logical reason than the original's splitting Tardis'. The new Dolby Surround Sound certainly really enhanced the music on this new edition. Made it more a part of the story and helped set the mood to a new level of enjoyment. All in all a great new cut. My only gripe is I wish the BBC would offer the original cut on tape still. The original would be 4 stars, new one is 5 stars I'd rate.",5,Very pleasing to watch this new &quot;Five Doctors&quot;.,998956800,"08 28, 2001",2001,1326,"['probably', 'closest', 'can', 'get', 'having', 'Doctors', 'meet', 'other', 'selves', 'early', 'incarnations', 'really', 'was', 'such', 'accomplishment', 'show', 'former', 'companions', 'come', 'as', 'well', 'least', 'made', 'sense', 'new', '5', 'Doctors', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'added', 'footage', 'was', 'originally', 'cut', 'down', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'new', 'stuff', 'new', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'great', 'watch', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'relive', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'new', 'edition', 'certainly', 'made', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'enjoyed', 'cast', 'was', 'fond', 'opening', 'too', 'put', 'first', 'Dr.', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'nostalgic', 'touch', 'replacement', 'Richard', 'Hurndall', 'well', 'thought', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'tall', 'other', 'Doctors', 'are', 'great', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'absence', 'missed', 'Wished', ""'d"", 'done', 'new', 'ending', 'how', 'everyone', 'was', 'sent', 'home', 'made', 'more', 'logical', 'reason', 'original', 'splitting', 'Tardis', 'new', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'certainly', 'really', 'enhanced', 'music', 'new', 'edition', 'Made', 'more', 'part', 'story', 'helped', 'set', 'mood', 'new', 'level', 'enjoyment', 'great', 'new', 'cut', 'only', 'gripe', 'wish', 'BBC', 'would', 'offer', 'original', 'cut', 'tape', 'still', 'original', 'would', 'be', '4', 'stars', 'new', 'one', '5', 'stars', ""'d"", 'rate']",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS

If you're new to the series, this is a great introduction as you'll meet the aforementioned 5 Doctor's, a few of their assistants and get a solid foundation to explore the Doctor's further adventures.  It's not the strongest story in the series, but it's endlessly entertaining to see the Doctors relate to each other.The audio commentary is at turns insightful and funny but I seemed to detect an undercurent of resentment that was quite suprising to me.  Picture and sound is the best I've seen for a Doctor Who release.  The 33minute soundtrack is a nice diversion, but I must admit to not listening to it all.  One complaint I have is the omission of a booklet with chapter stops.  I know you can find this information from the menu screen, but it's useful to have chapter stops in a booklet or on the back of the packaging for easy refrence when watching the episode.Once again The Five Doctors is essential for historical as well as foundational reasons and this DVD is the best presentation it's ever recieved.

For the 20th Anniversary of the great Doctor Who series, get together all of the surviving Doctors and pit them against some of their bitterest enemies - what could be better! Well Tom Baker, that's what. Unfortunately he didn't feel he had been away from the series long enough to make a comeback, hence the tacked on ""Shada"" portion for this story.However that's the bad news. The good news is you get Pertwee and Troughton snapping at each other (though in too few scenes) as well as the underrated Peter Davison, who brought a great deal to the series. You get some of the best companions like Sarah-Jane and the Brig though you do have to put up with the awful Turlough and the past her prime Susan. As for the enemies, while Anthony Ainley could never compete with the late Roger Delgado, he puts up a great performance while the Cybermen seem to be tricked rather too easily.

268984,A11GO5VA74HD8K,6301801288,Crazy Fox,"[6, 8]","It pains me greatly to give any ""Doctor Who"" DVD less than four stars. I love this show, and in my biased and embarrassingly overenthusiastic way consider ""Doctor Who"" at its worst to be light years ahead of most shows at their best. Unfortunately, if I needed an actual sample to test that theory, ""The Five Doctors"" would fit the bill nicely.First of all, the entire concept is unoriginal. This is a cardinal sin, for originality is the lifeblood of ""Doctor Who"" and is what has kept it going for decades--without it, we wouldn't have been celebrating the show's twentieth anniversary in 1983 at all (as ""The Five Doctors"" is meant to do). And yet instead of celebrating by coming up with something new, the producers and creative staff rested on their laurels it seems and just rehashed the very creative and innovative tenth anniversary story ""The Three Doctors""--only adding in more and more stuff, proving that there really can be too much of a good thing.Second of all, the title is a blatant case of false advertising. William Hartnell, rest his soul, had shuffled off his mortal coil years before, and there is simply no replacing him as the first Doctor. And frankly, it seems almost blasphemous to try. Richard Hurndall does his level best at the utterly thankless job of being somebody else's replacement, and there are one or two spots where he allllmost reminds you of Hartnell, but mostly the first Doctor here is a pale, anemic caricature of the real thing. There's all of the crotchety gruffness but none of the grandfatherly charm and none of the mischievous twinkle, and he even gets intimidated by danger whereas the real first Doctor would've stood his ground and made a fine display of stern indignation. And as if Hartnell's absence weren't bad enough, we also have the absence (more avoidable in theory) of the fourth Doctor. Yes, Tom Baker is not in this one. It would've been really fun to see him in the role again, this time interacting with two of his predecessors as well as with his rather bland replacement, but whether by choice or circumstance it was not to be--and splicing in old footage from ""Shada"" isn't going to fool anyone. So ironically we are back to Three Doctors all over again, after all...But even this is squandered! A big part of the enjoyment in ""The Three Doctors"" was the interaction between three (or mainly two, really) incarnations of the same character--all quite different but just similar enough to get on each other's nerves. Here though the writer has dealt with the dramatic overkill of having four protagonists and their companions all doing the same thing by splitting them up, letting them converge only at the very end. A reasonable solution, yes, but it takes away the fun of seeing the five (or four, or, well, three plus a stand-in--oh, anyway...) Doctors actually interact--and their trading a few quips at the conclusion is paltry compensation. Speaking of the conclusion, the Doctors all converge only to stand and watch as a holographic projection of a dead guy from history does the work of neutralizing the villain. Deus ex Machina resolutions are seldom satisfying, and it seems a poor way to celebrate a hero of twenty years on TV.There are tons of other problems. The second and third Doctors look visibly older than when they regenerated--unavoidable, but they just do. Both the Daleks and the Cybermen, hallmark villains of the show's long history, are made to appear weak-minded and feeble rather than formidable. The Master is offered extra regenerations in order to manipulate him into helping the Doctor, but if the Time Lords can just give those away willy-nilly then it makes no sense that the main villain (another Time Lord at the end of his last regeneration) is on a desperate quest for immortality--the, er, basic plot premise of the story, as such. And to top it off, on this DVD remastered scenes and CGI special effects are not optional but mandatory, which is evil worthy of the Master himself.The chief saving grace of this mess is the pure, unadulterated guilty pleasure of unabashed nostalgia. For all that there are way too many characters and they don't do much, it's still kind of heartwarming to see them again. Furthermore, here of all places, Anthony Ainley gives one of his finest, most nuanced performances as the Master--cunning and smooth rather than the cackling knuckle-popping baddie we usually get, and more complicated, unwilling to see a universe lacking the challenging presence of his nemesis. Finally, the DVD is worth watching just to see Patrick Troughton's shining performance as the second Doctor again, and his interaction with the good old Brigadier is simply priceless. So all is not lost. ""The Five Doctors"" is pretty close to as bad as ""Doctor Who"" can get, but that's still pretty decent, a fact that is worth celebrating after all. Still, I do hope they don't try to pull off ""The Ten Doctors"" in 2013...",2,"""To lose is to win, and he who wins shall lose.""",1184025600,"07 10, 2007",2007,4931,"['greatly', 'give', 'Doctor',

268985,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6301801288,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 3]","The original version of The Five Doctors was the first story I bought on sale video, and I saw it before the normal sequence of Peter Davison stories that were being shown on PBS.  It gave me a good look at Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee (the Second and Third Doctors), as well as Liz Sladen (Sarah Jane), and Nicholas Courtney (the Brigadier).The Doctor, Tegan, and Turlough are resting at the Eye of Orion, a relaxing field with an effect like Earth after a rainstorm.  An unseen black-gloved figure manipulating some controls and kidnaps the First Doctor, played with great William Hartnell-ness by Richard Hurndall.  A miniature of the Doctor appears.  Hmmm, who around here likes shrinking people?  Familiar?  This happens to the Second and Third Doctor, as well as other companions, but a glitch occurs with the Fourth Doctor and Romana II, who are trapped in a time vortex.  With each attack, the Doctor suffers twinges of cosmic angst, and he must do something, lest he be pulled into the vortex and into oblivion.  &quot;Great chunks of me are being detached, like icebergs,&quot; he says.  &quot;I must become whole.&quot;The High Council of Time Lords, still led by Borusa, summon the Master to rescue the Doctor from Gallifrey's Death Zone, &quot;the black secret at the heart of your Time Lord paradise&quot; which is &quot;not the most hospitable of environments.&quot;  He does so, but is rebuffed by two of the Doctors, understandable as he was full of tricks and traps before.The Cybermen play a major role here, as three squads of them come out.  However, they prove no match to the &quot;most perfect killing machine ever devised,&quot; the sleek and featureless Raston Warrior Robot, who steals the show with its martial arts acrobatics and deadly lances and disks, and turns one squad into putty, impaling and decapitating away.  Only one Dalek appears here, as does a creature from the Second Doctor's era.There's plenty of fabulous dialogue here.  The Master tells us why the Doctor is so endeared to fans:  &quot;A cosmos without the Doctor scarcely bears thinking about.&quot;  Something the Beeb should have remembered in 1989.The Time Scoop is seen as a spinning black obelisk here, and the Fourth Doctor and Romana's faces are swirling when caught in the time eddy.  These were changed in the revamped edition of the Five Doctors, sold together as a two-pack with The King's Demons.My favorite Doctor, Jon Pertwee, comes off the best here, &quot;ever so resourceful,&quot; as the Master says.  He's still the charming, improvising guy with ideas; it's as if he never left the series, and he's a calm counterpart to the strung out Sarah Jane.  She's more wimpy here, and that's a big contrast to her earlier era, when she was more headstrong and self-assured.An interesting double-entendre is when the First Doctor sees traces of two other Doctors.  &quot;Well, well, well, so two of them made it.  I wonder what happened to the other.&quot;  This last sentence spoken in such an acidic tone, might be a reference to Tom Baker's last minute refusal to participate in the story.And the Second Doctor's solo presence implies that he came here inbetween the verdict and sentencing at his trial--there is a hint of that when he encounters Jamie and Zoe, his last travelling companions.I was right on one thing.  In the revamped version, the First Doctor's approximation of pi is 3.14287.  Here, it's more accurate--3.14159265.  Clearly they used an alternate take on the revamped version.  Another is the Cybermen led by the Master--how could they note fail to spot the Doctor and Tegan in the chessboard room upon entering?A welcome reunion from some Who alumni, past and present, (they even included some William Hartnell in The Dalek Invasion Of Earth and Tom Baker footage from the untelevised Shada) with old pairings up (Doctor Two and the Brigadier, Doctor Three and Sarah) bringing back fond memories of the past, as well as new pairings (Turlough and Susan).",5,A cosmic without the Doctor scarcely bears thinking about,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,3990,"['original', 'version', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'was', 'first', 'story', 'bought', 'sale', 'video', 'saw', 'normal', 'sequence', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'stories', 'were', 'being', 'shown', 'PBS', 'gave', 'good', 'look', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'Second', 'Third', 'Doctors', 'as', 'well', 'Liz', 'Sladen', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Nicholas', 'Courtney', 'Brigadier', '.The', 'Doctor', 'Tegan', 'Turlough', 'are', 'resting', 'Eye', 'Orion', 'relaxing', 'field', 'effect', 'Earth', 'rainstorm', 'unseen', 'black-gloved', 'figure', 'manipulating', 'controls', 'kidnaps', 'First', 'Doctor', 'played', 'great', 'William', 'Hartnell-ness', 'Richard', 'Hurndall', 'miniature', 'Doctor', 'Hmmm', 'who', 'here', 'shrinking', 'people', 'Familiar', 'Second', 'Third', 'Doctor', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'companions', 'glitch', 'Fourth', 'Doctor', 'Romana', 'II', 'who', 'are', 'trapped', 'time', 'vortex', 'attack', 'Doctor', 'suffers', 'twinges', 'cosmic', 'angst', 'must', 'do', 'something', 'be', 'pulled', 'vortex', 'oblivion', 'quot', 'Great', 'chunks', 'are', 'being', 'detached', 'icebergs', 'quot', 'quot', 'must', 'become', 'whole.', 'quot', 'High', 'Council', 'Time', 'Lords', 'still', 'led', 'Borusa', 'summon', 'Master', 'rescue', 'Doctor', 'Gallifrey', 'Death', 'Zone', 'quot', 'black', 'secret', 'heart', 'Time', 'Lord', 'paradise', 'quot', 'quot', 'not', 'most', 'hospitable', 'environments.', 'quot', 'so', 'rebuffed', 'two', 'Doctors', 'understandable', 'was', 'full', 'tricks', 'traps', 'before.The', 'Cybermen', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'here', 'three', 'squads', 'come', 'out', 'However', 'prove', 'match', 'quot', 'most', 'perfect', 'killing', 'machine', 'ever', 'devised', 'quot', 'sleek', 'featureless', 'Raston', 'Warrior', 'Robot', 'who', 'show', 'martial', 'arts', 'acrobatics', 'deadly', 'lances', 'disks', 'one', 'squad', 'putty', 'impaling', 'decapitating', 'away', 'Only', 'one', 'Dalek', 'here', 'creature', 'Second', 'Doctor', 'era.There', 'plenty', 'fabulous', 'dialogue', 'here', 'Master', 'why', 'Doctor', 'so', 'endeared', 'fans', 'quot', 'cosmos', 'Doctor', 'scarcely', 'thinking', 'about.', 'quot', 'Something', 'Beeb', 'should', 'have', 'remembered', '1989.The', 'Time', 'Scoop', 'seen', 'spinning', 'black', 'obelisk', 'here', 'Fourth', 'Doctor', 'Romana', 'are', 'swirling', 'when', 'caught', 'time', 'eddy', 'were', 'changed', 'revamped', 'edition', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'sold', 'together', 'two-pack', 'King', 'Demons.My', 'favorite', 'Doctor', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'best', 'here', 'quot', 'ever', 'so', 'resourceful', 'quot', 'Master', 'still', 'charming', 'improvising', 'guy', 'ideas', 'never', 'left', 'series', 'calm', 'counterpart', 'strung', 'out', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'more', 'wimpy', 'here', 'big', 'contrast', 'earlier', 'era', 'when', 'was', 'more', 'headstrong', 'self-assured.An', 'interesting', 'double-entendre', 'when', 'First', 'Doctor', 'traces', 'two', 'other', 'Doctors', 'quot', 'Well', 'well', 'well', 'so', 'two', 'made', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'other.', 'quot', 'last', 'sentence', 'spoken', 'such', 'acidic', 'tone', 'might', 'be', 'reference', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'last', 'minute', 'refusal', 'participate', 'story.And', 'Second', 'Doctor', 'solo', 'presence', 'implies', 'came', 'here', 'inbetween', 'verdict', 'sentencing', 'trial', 'hint', 'when', 'Jamie', 'Zoe', 'last', 'travelling', 'companions.I', 'was', 'right', 'one', 'thing', 'revamped', 'version', 'First', 'Doctor', 'approximation', 'pi', '3.14287', 'Here', 'more', 'accurate', '3.14159265', 'Clearly', 'used', 'alternate', 'take', 'revamped', 'version', 'Cybermen', 'led', 'Master', 'how', 'could', 'note', 'fail', 'spot', 'Doctor', 'Tegan', 'chessboard', 'room', 'entering', 'welcome', 'reunion', 'Who', 'alumni', 'past', 'present', 'even', 'included', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'Dalek', 'Invasion', 'Earth', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'footage', 'untelevised', 'Shada', 'old', 'pairings', 'up', 'Doctor', 'Two', 'Brigadier', 'Doctor', 'Three', 'Sarah', 'bringing', 'back', 'fond', 'memories', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'pairings', 'Turlough', 'Susan']",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS
268986,A2XMBWQL0LGNJD,6301801288,Dave Cordes,"[7, 7]","A classic celebration story involving the first five actors to play the legendary Doctor but this DVD is indeed a &quot;Special Edition&quot; and not the version originally televised.  For example, the special effect of the mysterious Black Triangle that abducts the timelords from their respective time streams has been updated with a new CGI morphing effect.  Also, when Tom Baker is returned at the end the scene has been changed.  Instead of the Doctor and Romana seen happily rushing back to the Tardis in the broadcast version, we now see a recycled shot of the Doctor once again punting the yact as the new ghostly whirlwind effect flies off.  This is perhaps the most disappointing change, as I would rather have seen the aforementioned cut shot from the unaired &quot;Shada&quot; episode which fitted in perfectly with the story.  Also at the end, instead of the 3 Tardis' splitting up in different directions, the new whirlwind effect is used to show the Doctors dematerializing from the Tardis.  While I love the new 5.1 Dolby sound mix and the inclusion of the isolated music soundtrack, I am ambivalent to the new alterations.  Being a purist, I would rather have the original broadcast version intact.  Granted the visual effects at the time were of poor quality but part of the production cheeziness is what Doctor Who is all about.

268987,A3QPHVR39IMAVC,6301801288,David L. White,"[6, 6]","Yes, the one with all of them. Except that the first Doctor is recast and played very well by Richard Hurndall and Tom Baker, Doctor #4 chose not to take part. The producer bought Tom Baker many lunches and many drinks and in the end, he still refused to take part. So, bits from the unfinished story, Shada, were used for Tom's contribution.In watching this story, it's important to not have extremely high expectations. It crams a lot into a 90 minute slot (100 minutes for the extended, special edition DVD). It's best to switch off your brain and let the images hit you. All of the Doctors are in fine form, and it's especially nice to have the lovely Patrick Troughton recreating the 2nd Doctor, since there is so little that exists from his original run as the Doctor in the late '60s. It's just a big celebration of Doctor Who and all (well, many) have been invited.The Special edition works just fine and the new visual effects are a real enhancement to the story, in my opinion. None of the changes have drastically altered the story. In some cases, they have improved the feel of the story. For example, the voice of Rassilon has been enhanced in such a way that one believes that he is the most important figure in Time Lord history, rather than the game show host that was in the original version.This first DVD is light on features, like the UK release. I was rather pleased that the US release got the commentary with Peter Davison and Terrance Dicks. They seem to have fond memories of the program, along with a few disappointments and frustrations.I enjoyed the DVD enormously and hope that the Doctor Who releases on DVD continue.",4,"No, not the mind probe...",1031529600,"09 9, 2002",2002,1647,"['Yes', 'one', 'first', 'Doctor', 'recast', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Richard', 'Hurndall', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Doctor', '4', 'chose', 'not', 'take', 'part', 'producer', 'bought', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'many', 'lunches', 'many', 'drinks', 'end', 'still', 'refused', 'take', 'part', 'So', 'bits', 'unfinished', 'story', 'Shada', 'were', 'used', 'Tom', 'contribution.In', 'watching', 'story', 'important', 'not', 'have', 'extremely', 'high', 'expectations', 'lot', '90', 'minute', 'slot', '100', 'minutes', 'extended', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'best', 'switch', 'off', 'brain', 'let', 'images', 'hit', 'Doctors', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'especially', 'nice', 'have', 'lovely', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'recreating', '2nd', 'Doctor', 'so', 'little', 'original', 'run', 'Doctor', 'late', ""'60s"", 'just', 'big', 'celebration', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'well', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'invited.The', 'Special', 'edition', 'just', 'fine', 'new', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'real', 'enhancement', 'story', 'opinion', 'None', 'changes', 'have', 'drastically', 'altered', 'story', 'cases', 'have', 'improved', 'feel', 'story', 'example', 'voice', 'Rassilon', 'been', 'enhanced', 'such', 'way', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'figure', 'Time', 'Lord', 'history', 'rather', 'game', 'show', 'host', 'was', 'original', 'version.This', 'first', 'DVD', 'light', 'features', 'UK', 'release', 'was', 'rather', 'pleased', 'US', 'release', 'got', 'commentary', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'Terrance', 'Dicks', 'seem', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'program', 'few', 'disappointments', 'frustrations.I', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'enormously', 'hope', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'DVD', 'continue']",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS

Miller,"[4, 4]","The only negative thing you can say about the new DVD release of &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; is that it's not, repeat, not the version you remember from the BBC, PBS, or VHS.  This is the &quot;special&quot; edition released a few years ago, cobbled together by various members of fandom without input from the original production crew.  Only slight changes have been made, but since &quot;Five Doctors&quot; is perhaps the one story that all DW fans may know backwards and forwards, the bulk of the alterations seem both inconsequential and annoying.  Even though the DVD box states that this edition is &quot;not intended as a replacement for the original&quot;, one wishes that for the DVD release, it hadn't in fact replaced the original.However, the DVD itself is a must-have.  &quot;Five Doctors&quot; the episode is a perfect distillation of the series into 90 minutes.  To see previous Doctors, several companions, and several popular enemies, all together on Gallifrey, in a story with a crisp, clear plot, is a joy.  Nearly every line of dialogue resonates, and the enthusiasm in the production is high.  The story works both as an episode in the ongoing series, and as a standalone reunion special.  Many subsequent DW books and audios have attempted to duplicate the magic of this story, with less success.  Here on this DVD is a little bit of everything that has made &quot;Doctor Who&quot; such grand viewing since 1963.The commentary track is by author Terrance Dicks, and the Fifth Doctor himself, Peter Davison.  This track is the best available track on the 3 DW DVDs out thus far.  The production anecdotes, insights into the script, asides, and digs at the Special Edition, are uniformly funny and interesting.  Terrance appears to remember every moment of every DW serial he worked on (literally dozens), and Peter's recall and sense of humor are nearly as sharp.  Thankfully, both men watched the episode before recording the track, so there's little dead air caused by their figuring out what happens next (unlike the commentary for the other two DVDs).The disc does lack the breadth of special features you can find on the other releases, but don't let that deter you from buying it.  Whether you watch it with commentary on or off, &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; should be mandatory repeated viewing for both newcomers to, and old hands at, the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe.",5,What?

Anyone expecting to see all five (at the time) incarnations of the good Doctor will be very disappointed - first Doctor William Hartnell had died 8 years before this episode was made, and is replaced here by veteran actor Richard Hurndall. Meanwhile popular fourth Doctor actor Tom Baker, in a fit of megalomania, declined to join the production and appears only in stock footage form.So why buying this DVD at all? Well, it's still a pretty good episode. Production values are about as high as Doctor Who gets, and the performances are top notch. Dialogue and story are both a little weaker than one might hope for, but bear in mind this was an anniversary special meant for the masses.

Although I found it to be quite a good story, I was disappointed that the DVD did not include the original edition, only the special edition, and it did not have many special features either. But I still enjoyed it. This version includes both editions along with many great special features. Why didn't they release this in 2001 (or 2002)?Now lets talk about the story itself. This is a great little adventure. The five incarnations of the Doctor are being taken out of time and space and placed in the Death Zone on Gallifrey where they fight many old foes inlcuding Daleks, Cybermen, Yeti, and the Master; plus a couple of new ones too including the Raston Warrior Robot (a great new villain), and another renegade Time Lord who is behind it all and trying to gain the ultimate power and rule Gallifrey for eternity. Now it's up to the Doctors to join forces and battle these villains and save Gallifrey once again.It is action-packed with lots of mystery, brilliant performaces from the cast, and some great directing. And even though you begin to suspect the main villain half-way through the story, the end still comes as a shock to see how he is defeated. The only let down is that you don't see much of Tom Baker in this story. He is only in two scenes. And although the special edition is better than the original, Tom Baker is seen even less in that one because they cut out one of his scenes, leaving only one. That's one thing I like better about the original version is that both scenes are included. That's the good thing about this DVD, you get to see both versions of the story, and the story itself is great.

And they owe him big time!  After all, it was the BBC's desperate hunger for shelf space that deprived us of dozens of classic stories from the show's sixties heyday.  Treasures wiped clean by bureaucratic short-sightedness.  Heavy sigh.But here they go again, releasing episodes piecemeal, cherry picking the supposed &quot;good&quot; ones and never getting around to what the Doctor deserves:  a full release of all available material.  A release, by the by, that DVD would be perfect for.  Imagine a disc with surviving clips from all deleted Hartnell and Troughton stories as a bonus.  Or with full episodes from incomplete serials that still exist but haven't yet seen video release; from &quot;The Reign of Terror&quot; and &quot;The Faceless Ones,&quot; for instance.But no.  Instead, we'll get three episodes this year.  Then maybe three more next year.  And I will have shuffled off this mortal coil by the time the BBC gets around to releasing &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot; or -- fervent wish -- a complete &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs.&quot;  Yes it does exist.So I'd like to make a modest proposal.  To Whom It May Concern at the BBC video division:  Take a lesson from Fox Home Video and consider a release a la the &quot;X-Files&quot; season box sets.  Perhaps three volumes to encompass all available Hartnell material.  One or two for all available Troughton stories.  And then a box set for each complete season from there on in.And not forgetting the McGann TV movie.The Doctor deserves a little respect.

It is nice to be able to See it but this Special Edition reminds of George Lucas's effects on the original star wars movie - a reduction of quality from the original.  Some scenes were added/ extended and I don't think they add anything to the story except drag out some of the scenes.  Additionally a few minutes were shaved from the SHADA clips used in the original broadcast - A crime considering Tom Baker is the most recognized Doctor for most TV audiences.  The folks at BBC made a great use of the SHADA footage for the original broadcast when Mr. Baker bowed out of the broadcast.AKnowing that when you watch a Dr Who story you aren't going to see great special effects you accepted that to watch the story.  ttempting to Adding to the story brings me to the CGI effects.  Unlike the more recent WHO DVD's you do not have the option to turn off the ""Enhanced"" Effects and sounds.  I feel this is a detriment for most of the scenes that have these enhancements.

269004,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,6301801288,jude pepper,"[1, 3]","at the appropriate time (a month and a half or so ago at this writing), i wrote a review of the Doctor(s)'s 50th anniversary adventure DAY OF THE DOCTOR. i've since been accused of being less than altogether fair to it's 20th anniverary counterpart. this seemed like the best way to set the record straight.i never meant to suggest that i disliked THE FIVE DOCTORS. there are indeed elements to reccomend it. all i said, and i stand by this statement, is that DAY OF THE DOCTOR was less concerned with inviting every conceivable established WHO element to the party. on DAY, writer/producer Steven Moffatt gave the story he was telling his full attention, and that's where it improves upon FIVE.whereas the producer of the series at this time, one John Nathan-Turner, had a decided P.T. Barnum streak in him and tended to promote the series using that brand of spectacle. his showman tendencies fortunately didn't damage the series too severely very often, but they were never less helpful than when they convinced him to heap every attainable piece of WHO effluvia onto this plate. the Daleks, the Yeti, K9, and several surplus companions make neither necessary nor logical walk-on appearances solely for the marquee value.i did take one stand from which i hereby back down. i mentioned that Tom Baker declined to participate, which was an ironic favor because it meant the narrative could be slightly less complicated. but on reflection, maybe not. in fact, he ruined an idyllic circumstance for us. at the time the only Doctor to of yet died was William Hartnell. Hartnell's crotchety old fart version is the weakest Doctor there has ever been (and, unless Bobcat Goldthwait gets the part at some point, the weakest Doctor there is ever likely to be). circumstance was unusually tidy, making the unavailable Doctor the expendable Doctor. so it could've been that imperfect protoype Doctor to get tangled up in the limbo of the ""time stream,"" leaving plenty of room for Tom.when Tom backed out, an actor named Richard Hurdnall was brought in to simulate the first Doctor. his performance is comparable to a celebrity impersonation by a stand-up comedian, making the character even more abrasive, and less endearing, than he already was. and just to rub salt in the wound, it is this counterfeit Doctor who hits upon the solution to the mystery. that's not simply a matter of my dislike for the first Doctor, it's a genuine blooper. the idea is obviously based on the cliche' of the wisdom of our elders, but as the first Doctor he's in fact the youngest, so the logic defeats itself!!(i've heard that by a twist of Fate, Hurdnall died so soon after this performance that he didn't even have a chance to pick up his paycheck. apparently there are even harsher critics than me.)but again, THE FIVE DOCTORS is not a complete washout, and i never meant to make it sound like one. it has a historical quest which appeals to the Indiana Jones fan in me, and a whodunnit which inevitably charmed my internal Sherlock Holmes/Perry Mason/Agatha Christie enthusiast. it builds up a fine atmosphere and used it well about two thirds of the time. it's look into the history of Rassilon (the Timelord messiah, if you will), sheds a bit of new light on the history of Gallifrey. said light isn't always quite comprehensible, but since the Timelords aren't Earthlings and therefore don't think like Earthlings, maybe it wasn't supposed to make complete sense by our standards.i was excited about this release because it was finally the televised version. for years the only one available on home video was the ""special edition,"" which is, alas, 10 minutes longer solely for the sake of being 10 minutes longer. if only they'd made the uncluttered first cut available on it's own rather than forcing a ""deluxe"" package of both upon us. (granted, i solved the problem by simply throwing away the extended version disc, but it's still more trouble than i should've had to go to.)so THE FIVE DOCTORS is not without it's charms, but let's face it, it's not without it's weaknesses, either.",3,"well technically, The 3 1/2 Doctors.",1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,4071,"['appropriate', 'time', 'month', 'half', 'so', 'ago', 'writing', 'i', 'wrote', 'review', 'Doctor', 's', '50th', 'anniversary', 'adventure', 'DAY', 'THE', 'DOCTOR', 'i', ""'ve"", 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'less', 'altogether', 'fair', '20th', 'anniverary', 'counterpart', 'seemed', 'best', 'way', 'set', 'record', 'straight.i', 'never', 'meant', 'suggest', 'i', 'disliked', 'THE', 'FIVE', 'DOCTORS', 'are', 'indeed', 'elements', 'reccomend', 'i', 'said', 'i', 'stand', 'statement', 'DAY', 'THE', 'DOCTOR', 'was', 'less', 'concerned', 'inviting', 'conceivable', 'established', 'WHO', 'element', 'party', 'DAY', 'writer/producer', 'Steven', 'Moffatt', 'gave', 'story', 'was', 'telling', 'full', 'attention', 'where', 'FIVE.whereas', 'producer', 'series', 'time', 'one', 'John', 'Nathan-Turner', 'had', 'decided', 'P.T', 'Barnum', 'streak', 'tended', 'promote', 'series', 'using', 'brand', 'spectacle', 'showman', 'tendencies', 'fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'damage', 'series', 'too', 'severely', 'very', 'often', 'were', 'never', 'less', 'helpful', 'when', 'convinced', 'heap', 'attainable', 'piece', 'WHO', 'effluvia', 'plate', 'Daleks', 'Yeti', 'K9', 'several', 'surplus', 'companions', 'make', 'necessary', 'logical', 'walk-on', 'appearances', 'solely', 'marquee', 'value.i', 'did', 'take', 'one', 'stand', 'i', 'hereby', 'back', 'down', 'i', 'mentioned', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'declined', 'participate', 'was', 'ironic', 'favor', 'meant', 'narrative', 'could', 'be', 'slightly', 'less', 'complicated', 'reflection', 'maybe', 'not', 'fact', 'ruined', 'idyllic', 'circumstance', 'time', 'only', 'Doctor', 'yet', 'died', 'was', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'Hartnell', 'crotchety', 'old', 'fart', 'version', 'weakest', 'Doctor', 'ever', 'been', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'part', 'point', 'weakest', 'Doctor', 'ever', 'likely', 'be', 'circumstance', 'was', 'unusually', 'tidy', 'making', 'unavailable', 'Doctor', 'expendable', 'Doctor', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'imperfect', 'protoype', 'Doctor', 'get', 'tangled', 'up', 'limbo', 'time', 'stream', 'leaving', 'plenty', 'room', 'Tom.when', 'Tom', 'backed', 'out', 'actor', 'named', 'Richard', 'Hurdnall', 'was', 'brought', 'simulate', 'first', 'Doctor', 'performance', 'comparable', 'celebrity', 'impersonation', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'making', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'abrasive', 'less', 'endearing', 'already', 'was', 'just', 'rub', 'salt', 'wound', 'counterfeit', 'Doctor', 'who', 'solution', 'mystery', 'not', 'simply', 'matter', 'dislike', 'first', 'Doctor', 'genuine', 'blooper', 'idea', 'obviously', 'based', 'cliche', 'wisdom', 'elders', 'first', 'Doctor', 'fact', 'youngest', 'logic', 'i', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'twist', 'Fate', 'Hurdnall', 'died', 'so', 'soon', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'chance', 'pick', 'up', 'paycheck', 'apparently', 'are', 'even', 'harsher', 'critics', 'again', 'THE', 'FIVE', 'DOCTORS', 'not', 'complete', 'washout', 'i', 'never', 'meant', 'make', 'sound', 'one', 'historical', 'quest', 'appeals', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'fan', 'whodunnit', 'inevitably', 'charmed', 'internal', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes/Perry', 'Mason/Agatha', 'Christie', 'enthusiast', 'up', 'fine', 'atmosphere', 'used', 'well', 'two', 'thirds', 'time', 'look', 'history', 'Rassilon', 'Timelord', 'messiah', 'will', 'bit', 'new', 'light', 'history', 'Gallifrey', 'said', 'light', ""n't"", 'always', 'quite', 'comprehensible', 'Timelords', 'are', ""n't"", 'Earthlings', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Earthlings', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'make', 'complete', 'sense', 'standards.i', 'was', 'excited', 'release', 'was', 'finally', 'televised', 'version', 'years', 'only', 'one', 'available', 'home', 'video', 'was', 'special', 'edition', 'alas', '10', 'minutes', 'longer', 'solely', 'sake', 'being', '10', 'minutes', 'longer', 'only', ""'d"", 'made', 'uncluttered', 'first', 'cut', 'available', 'own', 'rather', 'forcing', 'deluxe', 'package', 'granted', 'solved', 'problem', 'simply', 'throwing', 'away', 'extended', 'version', 'disc', 'still', 'more', 'trouble', 'i', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'go', 'THE', 'FIVE', 'DOCTORS', 'not', 'charms', 'let', 'face', 'not', 'weaknesses', 'either']",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS

Well, according to the Doctor it only happens in the direst of times...with the Timelords help, as in the THREE DOCTORS.Here the Doctor is taken out of time at points in his LIVES, featuring oddly enough 3 original actors playing their respective Doctors, the First Doctor played here by another actor and the 4th Doctor is sparingly taken from the unaired Shada episode (by Douglas Adams). The Doctor is taken out of time to play the GAME OF RASSILON in the Timelord DEATH ZONE facing old enemies like THE CYBERMEN, THE DALEKS, YETI, THE MASTER, who is actually meant to be rescuing the Doctor. Also along for the ride lots of classic companions including the Doctor's first companion SUSAN ""FOREMAN"", fan fav SARAH JANE SMITH along with a K9 cameo, UNIT'S Finest the Brigadier , cameos by Jamie and Zoey (sort of).  Tegan and Turlough are the 5th Doctor's current companions to they help out, but strangely absent is robot shape-shifter Kamelion, who isn't mentioned in the story, by timeline wise is in the TARDIS.The Doctors and their companions are split up each finding their own way to the Dark Tower at the center of the DEATHZONE games, ultimately leading to a showdown with their abducting benefactor who is no stranger either.The last DVD offered tweaked SFX options and several different edits have been offered of the Five Doctor's over the year, some more suspect then others, like the DVD deletion of the Cyberman's ""AHHH"" upon spotting the Doctor, which I greatly missed. The sometimes in, sometimes out ""Cyber-barf"" as well. Another change was the edited end effects of the TARDISes departure scene, which was removed, while making more sense in the latest edit, aren't nearly as cool.This release ties in nicely to the inclusion of TIME CRASH the brief  5th Doctor 10th Doctor team up to be included in the season 4th set.Drinking games for the Five Doctors:This one is simple...drink whenever there is a retro-reference from the show's past...this one loaded with 'em...for example:...baddies from the past, lots of 'em......companions from the past, lots of 'em.......quotes from the past ""I'll explain someday..."" or ""reverse the polarity of the neutron flow!""...Susan strains an ankle!....Classic!",5,A great special...we used to call it DOCTOR WHO meets DUNGEONS & DRAGONS!,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,2960,"['love', 'special', '.and', 'am', 'torn', 'not', 'want', 'buy', 'again', 'struggle', 'replace', 'DW', 'lost', 'Katrina', 'was', 'converting', 'DVD', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'one', 'DVD', 'were', 'Blue-Ray', ""'d"", 'atleast', 'be', 'able', 'justify', 'granted', 'are', 'lots', 'extras', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'not', 'sure', 'u', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'already', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'NEED', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'are', 'just', 'learning', 'way', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'universe', 'milestone', '5th', 'Doctor', 'teaming', 'up', 'past', 'selves', 'how', 'cool', 'surprisingly', 'obvious', 'timetraver', 'long', 'lived', 'one', 'even', 'whole', 'universe', 'disposal', 'must', 'meet', 'now', 'again', 'Well', 'according', 'Doctor', 'only', 'direst', 'times', 'Timelords', 'help', 'THREE', 'DOCTORS.Here', 'Doctor', 'taken', 'time', 'points', 'LIVES', 'featuring', 'oddly', 'enough', '3', 'original', 'actors', 'playing', 'respective', 'Doctors', 'First', 'Doctor', 'played', 'here', 'actor', '4th', 'Doctor', 'sparingly', 'taken', 'unaired', 'Shada', 'episode', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'Doctor', 'taken', 'time', 'play', 'GAME', 'OF', 'RASSILON', 'Timelord', 'DEATH', 'ZONE', 'facing', 'old', 'enemies', 'CYBERMEN', 'THE', 'DALEKS', 'YETI', 'THE', 'MASTER', 'who', 'actually', 'meant', 'be', 'rescuing', 'Doctor', 'Also', 'along', 'ride', 'lots', 'classic', 'companions', 'including', 'Doctor', 'first', 'companion', 'SUSAN', 'FOREMAN', 'fan', 'fav', 'SARAH', 'JANE', 'SMITH', 'K9', 'cameo', 'UNIT', 'Finest', 'Brigadier', 'cameos', 'Jamie', 'Zoey', 'sort', 'Tegan', 'Turlough', 'are', '5th', 'Doctor', 'current', 'companions', 'help', 'out', 'strangely', 'absent', 'robot', 'shape-shifter', 'Kamelion', 'who', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'story', 'timeline', 'wise', 'TARDIS.The', 'Doctors', 'companions', 'are', 'split', 'up', 'finding', 'own', 'way', 'Dark', 'Tower', 'center', 'DEATHZONE', 'games', 'ultimately', 'leading', 'showdown', 'abducting', 'benefactor', 'who', 'stranger', 'either.The', 'last', 'DVD', 'offered', 'tweaked', 'SFX', 'options', 'several', 'different', 'edits', 'have', 'been', 'offered', 'Five', 'Doctor', 'year', 'more', 'suspect', 'then', 'others', 'DVD', 'deletion', 'Cyberman', 'AHHH', 'spotting', 'Doctor', 'greatly', 'missed', 'sometimes', 'sometimes', 'Cyber-barf', 'as', 'well', 'change', 'was', 'edited', 'end', 'effects', 'TARDISes', 'departure', 'scene', 'was', 'removed', 'making', 'more', 'sense', 'latest', 'edit', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'cool.This', 'release', 'ties', 'nicely', 'inclusion', 'TIME', 'CRASH', 'brief', '5th', 'Doctor', '10th', 'Doctor', 'team', 'up', 'be', 'included', 'season', '4th', 'set.Drinking', 'games', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'one', 'simple', 'drink', 'whenever', 'retro-reference', 'show', 'past', 'one', 'loaded', ""'em"", 'example', 'baddies', 'past', 'lots', ""'em"", 'companions', 'past', 'lots', ""'em"", 'past', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'someday', 'reverse', 'polarity', 'neutron', 'flow', 'Susan', 'ankle', '.Classic']",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS

A mysterious enemy traps all five (so far) Doctors (well, three and a half, really; the first Doctor is played by Richard Hurndall instead of the much-loved ""Billy"" Hartnell, who is deceased, and the fourth Doctor's actor, Tom Baker, is unavailable and so the story simply has him trapped in a time bubble or something) in a giant landscaped arena and pits them against many old enemies: a Dalek, a platoon of Cybermen, a yeti, a lightning-fast warrior robot and, of course, the Master.The plot is pure ..., but it really doesn't matter; unusually good special effects (updated & remastered recently) and great acting on the part of the lead characters (especially Patrick Troughton) make this story spectacular. The scenes of the Doctors teaming up is particularly warm, and great work is done by the companions, past and present: Susan (a grown woman now, but she still manages the silly feat of falling & spraining her ankle), Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (who gets to give the Master a sweet right-cross), Sarah Jane Smith (who acts her part as if she never stopped playing it), the cynical Turlough and the acerbic Tegan, who gets to show the crabby first Doctor that she can scold as well as he can. Great photography, moments of deep suspense, and a fantastic action scene where the warrior robot coldly and efficiently slaughters at least a dozen Cybermen make this story very accessible to modern viewers.

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[3, 3]","Go ahead and buy it -- you will definitely not be disappointed.Yes, I know Tom Baker (born in 1934!) refused to cooperate because his ego is *still* out of control and he traditionally refused to share the stage with any of the other Doctors, but Terrence Dicks (the writer of this story and of many other Doctor Whos) fixed it. He and the producers took Baker out of another story which never aired, (*Shada* -- never saw air time due to strikes but you can buy the DVD now), and stuck him in plenty good enough, (along with companion Lalla Ward ""Romana"" who later became Baker's wife... briefly), to complete ""The Five Doctors"" theme. What did they do about poor old dead William Hartnell? They got a great actor who looked and acted just like him (Richard Hurndall), and he was absolutely superb! You will immediately accept him as Hartnell.HERE'S THE STORY: One by one, each of the five Doctors get swept up by a *triangular Time Lord snatcher* [my phrase] and all except the Baker Doctor get sent to Gallifrey (where the Time Lords reside and run the Universe, or Galaxy, or whatever.) Baker gets ""stuck"" in some sort of time warp and so he's pretty much out of the picture at that point. The short of the story is, some nefarious person, (The Master? He's in it too and very good at that!), is trying to become immortal and the five Doctors, for some convoluted reason, are subjected to being pawns of this unknown villian, who is revealed near the end. In the meantime, you get to enjoy LOTS of former companions and you additionally get the fun of seeing the Doctors interact. They certainly do not love one another, even though they are theoretically the same person (alien, actually), regenerated.As an additional benefit, there are more goodies with this two-disc set. On one disc, you get the entire story, all episodes, plus a ""companions commentary"" option, plus some other extras. On the second disc, you get the exact SAME entire story, only it has available a so-called ""production commentary"" in which Terrance Dicks continually rants about what he didn't write which sneaked into the story, plus his unending pointing out all of his great ideas which DID remain in the yarn... and Peter Davison mostly remains calm and listens to what this renowned, but somewhat insane, writer has to say. Oh, Davison *does* have a few things to say. Plus there are more extras on this disc. So it's a monumental deal.Did I like the story? Well, as convoluted as it is at times, (Terrence Dicks had to perform constant re-writes due to people popping in and out of the project up until the last minute), I really, honestly thought it was great. There is a LOT of outdoor scenery (shot on film) and so it's a so-called ""piebald production"", mixing film with videotape. But that was the norm for period Doctor Who and most folks don't even notice. Film was expensive so they usually avoided location shooting and this one has enough to maintain up one's interest. The best adversary in the flick? Definitely, *The Raston Robot*, here, if you want to copy and paste the address: [...]Do not hesitate in the least to grab this Doctor Who treasure chest.

It has some really stupid moments (Sarah Jane really can't climb out of that ditch unaided?  My driveway is steeper than that!) but there are some really awesome moments as well - Raston Robot I'm looking at you.  The problem is that they had to bring together all five Doctors as promised (kind of - William Hartnell was dead by this point so Richard Hurndall takes over with adequate results as the First Doctor and Tom Baker is seen only in footage from the unaired ""Shada"" - but you already knew that, didn't you?) so the story is rather clunky and artificial as a result.

Then-current Doctor Peter Davison (Number Five) was joined by predecessors Patrick Troughton (Doctor Number Two) and Jon Pertwee (Number Three).  The late William Hartnell had passed on nearly a decade earlier, but is seen at the very beginning of the episode in a clip from The Dalek Invasion of Earth, and Richard Hurndall does an admirable job stepping into Hartnell's shoes as the First Doctor.  Tom Baker, the Fourth Doctor, was unavailable to do the anniversary story, but is seen in clips from the unfinished story Shada (along with Lalla Ward as Romana), doctored up with some special effects and the subplot of the Fourth Doctor being trapped in a time vortex as an explanation as to why that particular Doctor is not part of the action in the story.  Several of the Doctor's companions put in appearances--most of them cameos--including Sarah Jane Smith (played by Elisabeth Sladen), K-9 (voiced by John Leeson), the Doctor's granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford), Jamie McCrimmon (Fraser Hines), and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) among several others in addition to then-current companions Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) and Turlough (Mark Strickson).  The story involves an area on the Doctor's homeworld of Gallifrey called the Death Zone.  A member of the High Council of the Time Lords has reactivated the Death Zone and used a timescoop to lift the Doctor's earlier incarnations, along with several of his companions from their respective time streams and place them in the Zone.  The Fifth Doctor and his companions are brought to the Death Zone when the TARDIS is caught in a tractor beam.  Several of the Doctor's old enemies--Daleks, Yeti, Cybermen--have also been brought to the Zone.  The Doctor's archenemy the Master (the late Anthony Ainley) is sent into the Zone by the High Council to rescue the Doctors.  The Doctors and their companions must journey to a dark tower (the Tomb of Rassilon) at the center of the Zone to disable the tractor beam holding the TARDIS, and find out who has reactivated the Death Zone to play the Game of Rassilon.  Yes, having so many characters involved does make this story a bit of a cluster, but The Five Doctors made a great celebration of Doctor Who's twentieth anniversary, and it's one of my favorite stories from the Peter Davison era.",4,20th Anniversary Story,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,2439,"['Five', 'Doctors', 'aired', 'November', '1983', '90', 'minute', 'special', 'commemorate', 'twentieth', 'anniversary', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Then-current', 'Doctor', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'Number', 'Five', 'was', 'joined', 'predecessors', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'Doctor', 'Number', 'Two', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'Number', 'Three', 'late', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'had', 'passed', 'nearly', 'decade', 'earlier', 'seen', 'very', 'beginning', 'episode', 'clip', 'Dalek', 'Invasion', 'Earth', 'Richard', 'Hurndall', 'admirable', 'job', 'stepping', 'Hartnell', 'shoes', 'First', 'Doctor', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Fourth', 'Doctor', 'was', 'unavailable', 'do', 'anniversary', 'story', 'seen', 'clips', 'unfinished', 'story', 'Shada', 'Lalla', 'Ward', 'Romana', 'doctored', 'up', 'special', 'effects', 'subplot', 'Fourth', 'Doctor', 'being', 'trapped', 'time', 'vortex', 'explanation', 'why', 'particular', 'Doctor', 'not', 'part', 'action', 'story', 'Several', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'put', 'appearances', 'most', 'cameos', 'including', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Smith', 'played', 'Elisabeth', 'Sladen', 'K-9', 'voiced', 'John', 'Leeson', 'Doctor', 'granddaughter', 'Susan', 'Carole', 'Ann', 'Ford', 'Jamie', 'McCrimmon', 'Fraser', 'Hines', 'Brigadier', 'Lethbridge-Stewart', 'Nicholas', 'Courtney', 'several', 'others', 'addition', 'then-current', 'companions', 'Tegan', 'Jovanka', 'Janet', 'Fielding', 'Turlough', 'Mark', 'Strickson', 'story', 'area', 'Doctor', 'homeworld', 'Gallifrey', 'called', 'Death', 'Zone', 'member', 'High', 'Council', 'Time', 'Lords', 'reactivated', 'Death', 'Zone', 'used', 'timescoop', 'lift', 'Doctor', 'earlier', 'incarnations', 'several', 'companions', 'respective', 'time', 'streams', 'place', 'Zone', 'Fifth', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'are', 'brought', 'Death', 'Zone', 'when', 'TARDIS', 'caught', 'tractor', 'beam', 'Several', 'Doctor', 'old', 'enemies', 'Daleks', 'Yeti', 'Cybermen', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'brought', 'Zone', 'Doctor', 'archenemy', 'Master', 'late', 'Anthony', 'Ainley', 'sent', 'Zone', 'High', 'Council', 'rescue', 'Doctors', 'Doctors', 'companions', 'must', 'journey', 'dark', 'tower', 'Tomb', 'Rassilon', 'center', 'Zone', 'disable', 'tractor', 'beam', 'holding', 'TARDIS', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'reactivated', 'Death', 'Zone', 'play', 'Game', 'Rassilon', 'Yes', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'involved', 'make', 'story', 'bit', 'cluster', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'made', 'great', 'celebration', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'twentieth', 'anniversary', 'one', 'favorite', 'stories', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'era']",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS

Still, you've got to hand it to them - they did a bang-up job for a show with a forever-fluctuating cast list (most notably our old buddy Tom Baker, who turned the project down before filming and got replaced by some old footage). ""The Five Doctors"" is a fun romp down memory lane, and as such happens to be one of the very best ways to bring new fans into the show (hey, it worked for me).So why did we exactly need a ""special edition""? No, the visual effects aren't especially great, but they never were on ""Doctor Who."" The additional scenes, while interesting, are mostly pointless additions that add nothing to the plot. Probably the best changes in the Special Edition are a slight rearrangement of events (which makes the story flow a little better) and some improved lightning effects. Not enough to justify a ""Special Edition,"" for sure.It's worth recognizing, though, that the original version of ""The Five Doctors"" will probably be released one day, and in the meantime, this really isn't a bad disc (certainly not the worst of the Region 1 line, by a long shot). Possibly where it disappoints the most is in the video department. The picture suffers from a lot of grain (especially in the outdoor sequences); while a significant step above the video, it pales in comparison to other '80s-era Who stories on DVD. The 5.1 soundtrack, on the other hand, is quite nice indeed.Admittedly the ""Who's Who"" biographies are a bit sparing, but the half-hour of isolated musical score is a great inclusion. Without a doubt, though, the best extra on the disc is the commentary with Peter Davison and Terrance Dicks, which was recorded especially for the Region 1 release. It remains one of the two or three best commentaries for the ""Who"" DVDs yet. Davison and Dicks make a great team, both taking a jovial attitude towards proceedings. Since this disc's release, Peter Davison has proven himself an invaluable commentator on other stories; I would very much like to hear from Terrance Dicks again.The story is a great way to get new fans into your favorite series, and the commentary alone makes the disc worth a seasoned fan's purchase.",3,"A Great Reunion, a Reasonably Good DVD",1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,2296,"['20th', 'anniversary', 'special', 'corny', 'essentially', 'plotless', 'designed', 'cram', 'as', 'many', 'Doctors', 'companions', 'monsters', 'possible', '90', 'minutes', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'got', 'hand', 'did', 'bang-up', 'job', 'show', 'forever-fluctuating', 'cast', 'list', 'most', 'notably', 'old', 'buddy', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'who', 'turned', 'project', 'down', 'filming', 'got', 'replaced', 'old', 'footage', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'fun', 'romp', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'such', 'happens', 'be', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'ways', 'bring', 'new', 'fans', 'show', 'hey', 'worked', '.So', 'why', 'did', 'exactly', 'need', 'special', 'edition', 'No', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'especially', 'great', 'never', 'were', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'additional', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'are', 'mostly', 'pointless', 'additions', 'add', 'nothing', 'plot', 'Probably', 'best', 'changes', 'Special', 'Edition', 'are', 'slight', 'rearrangement', 'events', 'story', 'flow', 'little', 'better', 'improved', 'lightning', 'effects', 'Not', 'enough', 'justify', 'Special', 'Edition', 'sure.It', 'worth', 'recognizing', 'though', 'original', 'version', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'released', 'one', 'day', 'meantime', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'disc', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst', 'Region', '1', 'line', 'long', 'shot', 'Possibly', 'where', 'most', 'video', 'department', 'picture', 'suffers', 'lot', 'grain', 'especially', 'outdoor', 'sequences', 'significant', 'step', 'video', 'comparison', 'other', ""'80s-era"", 'Who', 'stories', 'DVD', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'other', 'hand', 'quite', 'nice', 'indeed.Admittedly', 'Who', 'Who', 'biographies', 'are', 'bit', 'sparing', 'half-hour', 'isolated', 'musical', 'score', 'great', 'inclusion', 'doubt', 'though', 'best', 'extra', 'disc', 'commentary', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'Terrance', 'Dicks', 'was', 'recorded', 'especially', 'Region', '1', 'release', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'best', 'commentaries', 'Who', 'DVDs', 'yet', 'Davison', 'Dicks', 'make', 'great', 'team', 'taking', 'jovial', 'attitude', 'towards', 'proceedings', 'disc', 'release', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'proven', 'invaluable', 'commentator', 'other', 'stories', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'hear', 'Terrance', 'Dicks', 'again.The', 'story', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'new', 'fans', 'favorite', 'series', 'commentary', 'alone', 'disc', 'worth', 'seasoned', 'fan', 'purchase']",Doctor Who - The Five Doctors VHS

269028,A82S5Y6AOD46N,6301801288,"tin2x ""tin2x""","[9, 10]","I'm actually going to start with the story itself first.  Who fans know it, and I think there's generally some great affection for this.  However if you're NOT a Who fan I'm not sure, despite what many speculate, that this is a good introduction.  There is a LOT of Doctor Who history which you're assumed to know to understand how the same character is being played by 5 different actors in the same place at the same time (or nowhere in time technically).  It is also not representative of the normal stories because of the need for getting all the major characters on the screen.  Additionally while the three most classic villains of Doctor Who (The Master, the Daleks, and the Cybermen) are in this (and us Who fans like to see them) they are hardly menacing as when involved in their own plots to gain intergalactic domination.  For novices this story was made to celebrate Doctor Who and in many ways succeeds for fans, but I think is not a good introduction for people new to the series, unless of course you have a fan to talk you through it.For fans though there are some great things.  First of all we get to see the different regenerations of the Doctors interract with each other.  This is ALWAYS hilarious.  While each Doctor had their own manner and sense of humour in dealing with their companions, it's absolutely hilarious to see how much they dislike their other selves.As noted above the top Who villains make cameos, but not at all satisfying ones.  Teh Cybermen and the lone Dalek just aren't threatening without their own specific plans for world domination.  The Master is a bit better and has his moments but even he is rather tame in this episode.Naturally we also get to witness pathetic assistants (usually female as is the case in Doctor Who), some witty yet cheesy one liners,and some cheesy special effects.  However for people not familiar with Doctor Who, these are actually all part of the appeal.  Much like older Bond films there are things that might make one wince in real life that are priceless to see on the screen.Personally as they're only 2 other stories with multiple Doctors this is a rare treat.  The banter is at times priceless, but for me there was something else that made this a fantastic DVD.The commentary by Peter Davison (the 5th Doctor) and Terrance Dicks is wonderful.  To have the man who largely wrote the story and one of the principal actors discussing script choices, rapid edits, shooting conditions, and of course BBC budget limitations (notorious, and often explanatory for the cheesiness found in Doctor Who as well as Blake's 7 and other British science fiction).  From experience some commentary tracks are dull or of questionable value (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon imho) but this is one of the BEST ever!  Davison and Dicks don't just tease others but take themselves to tasks for things that they wished they could have done better.  Marvelous!I whole-heartedly recommend this DVD, but be aware that it is not a truly first class Doctor Who story, but a Doctor Who EVENT.  For newbies I really urge you to look elsewhere.  Watch a classic episode or two, but if you get this as your introduction you may be confused and nonplussed by the villains to go much futher.
