Were made by ZIV television .Tombstone Territory was among the bestof them. Unfortunately you can only find the 1st season. But a complete 91 episode set comprising all 3 seasons of the series was issued through Walmart .Earlier this year. But they got snapped upBefore anyone had a chance to buy them.Walmart has no plans to restock them.And if you try to buy it on eBay, You'll pay 100.00 bucks or more, for what Walmart sold for 20.00 .

Airing from 1957-60, this ZIV production pretty much was lost in the shuffle of TV westerns that flooded the airwaves. After 2 seasons in primetime, a third season aired in syndication, and then the town too tough to die lived on in re-runs until B&W; shows were dropped by most stations.Up until now, the only episodes available were bootleg copies, most in very very poor condition. Now with this release it looks like they were made yesterday. Timeless has dipped into the MGM library for almost pristine prints.Have Gun had Palladin, Gunsmoke had Matt/Kitty/Chester and Doc, Bonanza had the &#34;boys&#34;, Big Valley had Victoria.......Tombstone had excitement, stories and Zivs moody background music. The lead, Pat Conway as Sheriff Clay Hollister, is an underrated actor. Plus he looked good. Wearing a gun on both hips, black hat, black boots and string tie set him apart from most of the 1950's oaters.I would have lost my house on a bet that this show would be out on DVD. I beg you to buy this show because not only will you love it, but maybe there is hope that Timeless will continue with seasons 2 and 3.

Land ""music collector""","[12, 12]","Love this show, it was one of the best westerns ever on TV and the closing song was the added bonus that made it unforgettable.I watched this show every week as a kid and looked forward to the end when the song came on. I would have to place it in the top 5 of all time best western theme songs. I also have the complete set but will definitely be buying this release and hopefully the rest of the seasons. I highly reccommend this series, 2 great leads with some great guest stars and a fantastic closing song.",5,"""The Song-Made The Show Great""",1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,511,"['Love', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', 'ever', 'TV', 'closing', 'song', 'was', 'added', 'bonus', 'made', 'unforgettable.I', 'watched', 'show', 'week', 'kid', 'looked', 'forward', 'end', 'when', 'song', 'came', 'would', 'have', 'place', 'top', '5', 'time', 'best', 'western', 'theme', 'songs', 'also', 'have', 'complete', 'set', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'buying', 'release', 'hopefully', 'rest', 'seasons', 'highly', 'reccommend', 'series', '2', 'great', 'leads', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'fantastic', 'closing', 'song']",Tombstone Territory: Season 1

It was a ZIV production and I always thought of them as a second tier production company. But having bought season one, filling out my western DVD collection, I am finding that I'm very much enjoying these episodes. On a par with the Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp and I hold that series in high regard. Picture and sound quality are very good.
