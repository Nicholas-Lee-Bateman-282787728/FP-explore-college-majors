It stars the dim-witted Captain Monkey D. Luffy who wants to be ""KING OF THE PIRATES!"" which seems to be his catchphrase for the entire series.Luffy (as he's known for short) has wanted to be a pirate since he was young when he met a real life pirate called Shanks, who visited his village (this was in the Manga, the Anime series continues further in) Shanks soon became his idol along with infamous Gold Roger, who was hung and said his last words of where his treasure was ""I left it all in One Piece"".Luffy soon leaves his home island and goes in search of a Pirate Crew, on this journey he meets the infamous Pirate killer, Roanoa Zolo and saves him in exchange for him joining his crew.This series is a lot better then Hikaru No Go and Naruto so I suggest you pick up the DVD today!",5,I'm gonna be king of the pirates!,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,889,"['Yaoi', 'Fan', 'nature', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'series', 'watched', 'marathon', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'dim-witted', 'Captain', 'Monkey', 'D.', 'Luffy', 'who', 'be', 'KING', 'THE', 'PIRATES', 'be', 'catchphrase', 'entire', 'series.Luffy', 'known', 'short', 'wanted', 'be', 'pirate', 'was', 'young', 'when', 'met', 'real', 'life', 'pirate', 'called', 'Shanks', 'who', 'visited', 'village', 'was', 'Manga', 'Anime', 'series', 'further', 'Shanks', 'soon', 'became', 'idol', 'infamous', 'Gold', 'Roger', 'who', 'was', 'hung', 'said', 'last', 'words', 'where', 'treasure', 'was', 'left', 'One', 'Piece', '.Luffy', 'soon', 'home', 'island', 'search', 'Pirate', 'Crew', 'journey', 'infamous', 'Pirate', 'killer', 'Roanoa', 'Zolo', 'exchange', 'joining', 'crew.This', 'series', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'Hikaru', 'No', 'Go', 'Naruto', 'so', 'suggest', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'today']","One Piece, Vol. 1 - King of the Pirates"

Beg pardon, in Japanese, the liquids are identical and Americans CANNOT hear the actual sound produced by native speakers in various contexts, such that sometimes it appears to be R, sometimes it appears to be L, and sometimes (as in Gate of Hell, famously, but also in 1971, when my nihongo no sensei made a special point of wishing us ""Meri kurisumasu"" WITHOUT the L sound) the sound is like D!  Either Zolo or Zoro, but not Zorro, please ;-)  I like One Piece Volume 1 a lot, but I'm biased by a well-steeped sense of lunacy tempered by my 61 years.  Yes, I'm sure this suffers by comparison to the Japanese original (which tell me where to buy, s'il vous plait, as most things do), but the opening scenes of this LONG story are absurdly fun.  You will hear bits and pieces of mature dialog (since it relates to money, life, wisdom) that go past extremely fast and provide some smile-of-recognition moments.  I won't spoil it for you with details.  I don't care what kids think about 4Kids One Piece -- taken as it stands, it's funny, and probably a good introduction to the manga (which I'm trying to locate in Japanese) and whatever else follows on.  Four stars, ok?  Five would be perfect, and it's not that.",4,"The dialog is fast and over the head of everyone here, but other than that...",1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,1308,"['Hmmm', 'lot', 'animaniac', 'religious', 'cant', 'going', 'here', 'Really', 'Zolo', 'Zoro', 'Beg', 'pardon', 'Japanese', 'liquids', 'are', 'identical', 'Americans', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'hear', 'actual', 'sound', 'produced', 'native', 'speakers', 'various', 'contexts', 'such', 'be', 'R', 'be', 'L', 'sometimes', 'Gate', 'Hell', 'famously', 'also', '1971', 'when', 'nihongo', 'sensei', 'made', 'special', 'point', 'wishing', 'Meri', 'kurisumasu', 'L', 'sound', 'sound', 'D', 'Zolo', 'Zoro', 'not', 'Zorro', 'please', 'like', 'One', 'Piece', 'Volume', '1', 'lot', ""'m"", 'biased', 'well-steeped', 'sense', 'lunacy', 'tempered', '61', 'years', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'suffers', 'comparison', 'Japanese', 'original', 'tell', 'where', 'buy', ""s'il"", 'vous', 'plait', 'most', 'things', 'do', 'opening', 'scenes', 'LONG', 'story', 'are', 'absurdly', 'fun', 'will', 'hear', 'bits', 'pieces', 'mature', 'dialog', 'money', 'life', 'wisdom', 'go', 'past', 'extremely', 'fast', 'provide', 'smile-of-recognition', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'details', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'kids', 'think', '4Kids', 'One', 'Piece', 'taken', 'funny', 'probably', 'good', 'introduction', 'manga', ""'m"", 'trying', 'locate', 'Japanese', 'else', 'Four', 'stars', 'ok', 'Five', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'not']","One Piece, Vol. 1 - King of the Pirates"

971369,A6J4HWRNO9LYR,B000EBGEBE,JackieFan28,"[2, 3]","I know that the 4Kids version of One Piece is considered to be an abomination in the eyes of One Piece fans and anime fans in general...but I still love it.Why, you ask? Well, this version of the show was on television when I was younger, and I loved it. I watched every episode, each week, and I couldn't get enough. I was heartbroken when it was taken off the air, and as I grew older, I sought to find One Piece in some other format. Of course, I began reading the manga from the original one shot, and what can I say, I was in love. I still read One Piece today, and it's one of the greatest mangas out there.So, while the show it edited terribly, (some of the edits are completely bizarre), I do value this DVD. That's why I purchased it in the first place, nostalgia.To be honest, kids love this show, so if you have children that demand entertainment, show them this show.But if you're looking for quality One Piece, read the manga. And if you don't like reading, then watch the Funimation dub/sub of the anime.
