933692,A2FVE6V3YTFIDO,B000ATQYXI,"Amazon Customer ""Glen""","[5, 5]","Shaun Cassidy, former star of the Hardy Boys and singer of such pop hits as ""Da Doo Run Run"" and ""That's Rock And Roll"" grows up to be a writer/producer. He overcame the critics of the 70s who tried to pass him off as a clone of his brother, David and carved a niche of his own in the pop world, rather successfully, I may add. Unfortunately, though through no fault of his own, Shaun has never had a bonafide hit in the television field with his written masterpieces. American Gothic was one of these gems. Invasion was the most recent casualty of a network's mishandling of the sci-fi or horror fantasy genre.American Gothic was the tale of Trinity, South Carolina and its strange happenings. Run by Sheriff Lucas Buck (Gary Cole), the Devil incarnate, it is the tale of his coming to terms with his illegitimate son, Caleb Temple (Lucas Black) whom he wants to follow in his footsteps with the interference of returning prodigal cousin, reporter Gail Emory (Rescue Me's Paige Turco) and the town doctor Matt Crower (Medium's Jake Weber)as well as the supernatural influence of Caleb's dead sister, Merlyn. Produced by Shaun Cassidy and Evil Dead's Sam Raimi, American Gothic is a veritable classic tale of good vs. evil it's release marking it's 10th anniversary of broadcast including all 22 episodes, four of which were only broadcast on the Sci-Fi network. Trinity is a town, once visited, you will never forget....a town where there are skeletons in every closet. Sad to say, but Universal screwed up the true order of the episodes, but they are all here, and as one great reviewer here noted already, the true order as they should be viewed. This is the only thing that prevents me from giving this great set the five stars the package richly deserves.",4,Another Great Shaun Cassidy Vehicle Dies Too Soon,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1760,"['Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'former', 'star', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'singer', 'such', 'pop', 'hits', 'Da', 'Doo', 'Run', 'Run', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'up', 'be', 'writer/producer', 'critics', '70s', 'who', 'tried', 'pass', 'off', 'clone', 'brother', 'David', 'carved', 'niche', 'own', 'pop', 'world', 'rather', 'successfully', 'may', 'add', 'Unfortunately', 'fault', 'own', 'Shaun', 'never', 'had', 'bonafide', 'hit', 'television', 'field', 'written', 'masterpieces', 'American', 'Gothic', 'was', 'one', 'gems', 'Invasion', 'was', 'most', 'recent', 'casualty', 'network', 'mishandling', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'genre.American', 'Gothic', 'was', 'tale', 'Trinity', 'South', 'Carolina', 'strange', 'happenings', 'Run', 'Sheriff', 'Lucas', 'Buck', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Devil', 'incarnate', 'tale', 'coming', 'terms', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Caleb', 'Temple', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'whom', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'interference', 'returning', 'prodigal', 'cousin', 'reporter', 'Gail', 'Emory', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'Paige', 'Turco', 'town', 'doctor', 'Matt', 'Crower', 'Medium', 'Jake', 'Weber', 'as', 'well', 'supernatural', 'influence', 'Caleb', 'dead', 'sister', 'Merlyn', 'Produced', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'American', 'Gothic', 'veritable', 'classic', 'tale', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'release', 'marking', '10th', 'anniversary', 'broadcast', 'including', '22', 'episodes', 'four', 'were', 'only', 'broadcast', 'Sci-Fi', 'network', 'Trinity', 'town', 'once', 'visited', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'town', 'where', 'are', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'Sad', 'say', 'Universal', 'screwed', 'up', 'true', 'order', 'episodes', 'are', 'here', 'one', 'great', 'reviewer', 'here', 'noted', 'already', 'true', 'order', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'only', 'thing', 'prevents', 'giving', 'great', 'set', 'five', 'stars', 'package', 'richly', 'deserves']",American Gothic: The Complete Series

933694,AWQDIP5LPT8KT,B000ATQYXI,Bat185,"[16, 16]","Ten years ago CBS aired what would be the pilot for a terrifying new series called American Gothic.  The show starred Gary Cole as the sheriff of a small town called Trinity in South Carolina.  One might think, at first, this show is just a drama set in a small town but Sheriff Buck is more than meets the eye.  Soon, terrible things being happening.  What makes this show so intriguing is the mix of drama and horror.  The first time I heard ""Someone's at the door"" I was scared out of my mind.  This show was truly terrifying, but nonetheless intriguing.  Comparisons of this show could be made to the cancelled FOX series ""Point Pleasant"".  Both shows featured a teen who is the offspring of the devil.  Both shows were considered big gambles for their networks due to the supernatural nature of each series.  And both series were cancelled far too soon.Being such a fan of this show as I was when I was younger, I was thrilled when I heard it was being released on DVD.  I went to the video store the day it came out and immediately picked up my copy.  I loved the embossed, blood-red writing of the title.  The brown box was absolutely beautiful.  I had high hopes for the DVD set.My enthusiasm for the release quickly disappeared once I got home and popped this show in my DVD player....Not only were the episodes out of order so it was hard to follow the storyline unless I switched between disks, the episodes also skipped FREQUENTLY.  I would expect more in a DVD release for the price I paid.Universal truly saddened me with this set.  How can they expect to please their viewers if they put out sets such as this?  I have already contacted them and I would encourage anyone else who reads this and agrees with me to do the same.  If enough of us band together we should be able to get the quality DVDs we deserve.  As the saying goes, ""You get what you paid for"".  Well, I paid good money for this, I should get GOOD QUALITY.***UPDATE***  I have contacted Universal Studios about these DVDs and they wrote me back apologizing for the sets but they have NO plans of putting out better quality sets at this time.  They have just agreed to issue another copy of the DVD-18s to anyone who sends in what they currently have.  My advice would be to bring your sets back to the store where you purchased it and demand your money back.  Show the people at Universal we will NOT stand for this kind of shotty craftsmanship and DESERVE GOOD QUALITY DVDS.  The more money they lose, the more it will show them we will not stand for this.",2,"American Gothic, American Tragedy",1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2538,"['Ten', 'years', 'ago', 'CBS', 'aired', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'pilot', 'terrifying', 'new', 'series', 'called', 'American', 'Gothic', 'show', 'starred', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'sheriff', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Trinity', 'South', 'Carolina', 'One', 'might', 'think', 'first', 'show', 'just', 'drama', 'set', 'small', 'town', 'Sheriff', 'Buck', 'more', 'eye', 'Soon', 'terrible', 'things', 'being', 'happening', 'What', 'show', 'so', 'intriguing', 'mix', 'drama', 'horror', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'Someone', 'door', 'was', 'scared', 'mind', 'show', 'was', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'nonetheless', 'intriguing', 'Comparisons', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'cancelled', 'FOX', 'series', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'shows', 'featured', 'teen', 'who', 'offspring', 'devil', 'shows', 'were', 'considered', 'big', 'gambles', 'networks', 'due', 'supernatural', 'nature', 'series', 'series', 'were', 'cancelled', 'far', 'too', 'soon.Being', 'such', 'fan', 'show', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'went', 'video', 'store', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'immediately', 'picked', 'up', 'copy', 'loved', 'embossed', 'blood-red', 'writing', 'title', 'brown', 'box', 'was', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'DVD', 'set.My', 'enthusiasm', 'release', 'quickly', 'disappeared', 'once', 'got', 'home', 'popped', 'show', 'DVD', 'player', 'only', 'were', 'episodes', 'order', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'storyline', 'switched', 'disks', 'episodes', 'also', 'skipped', 'FREQUENTLY', 'would', 'expect', 'more', 'DVD', 'release', 'price', 'paid.Universal', 'truly', 'saddened', 'set', 'How', 'can', 'expect', 'please', 'viewers', 'put', 'out', 'sets', 'such', 'have', 'already', 'contacted', 'would', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'do', 'same', 'enough', 'band', 'together', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'deserve', 'saying', 'get', 'what', 'paid', 'Well', 'paid', 'good', 'money', 'should', 'get', 'GOOD', 'QUALITY', '***UPDATE***', 'have', 'contacted', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'DVDs', 'wrote', 'back', 'apologizing', 'sets', 'have', 'plans', 'putting', 'out', 'better', 'quality', 'sets', 'time', 'have', 'just', 'agreed', 'issue', 'copy', 'DVD-18s', 'anyone', 'who', 'what', 'currently', 'have', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'bring', 'sets', 'back', 'store', 'where', 'purchased', 'demand', 'money', 'back', 'Show', 'people', 'Universal', 'will', 'NOT', 'stand', 'kind', 'shotty', 'craftsmanship', 'DESERVE', 'GOOD', 'QUALITY', 'DVDS', 'more', 'money', 'lose', 'more', 'will', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'stand']",American Gothic: The Complete Series

But those are the types of bad guys who are the most interesting.  And Buck certainly delivers!  I only wish this series had aired longer than a mere 22 episodes.  The series has such a dark ending and it would have been nice if more closure had come to pass.  Maybe I can find some fanfics or something to satisfy me.  But I think this series is fantastic nonetheless.(Stop reading here if you don't want some plotpoints spoiled for you)  I wish Lucas Buck had finally gotten what was coming to him, though.

933697,A15ENK5HYBO2YF,B000ATQYXI,"Bruce F. Webster ""geek in a suit""","[178, 185]","This DVD set is long overdue. Loooong overdue. In our recent move from DC to Colorado, I threw out all of our recorded VHS tapes--except for the ones with ""American Gothic"". Now I can get rid of those as well, but for the right reason.Like ""Firefly"", ""American Gothic"" is a unique, outstanding series never given a chance by its network (CBS, in this case). It was also probably the most chilling and disturbing series ever to air, a stark morality tale with Gary Cole as the Devil incarnate (or a close kin), disguised as Sheriff Lucas Buck of the small town of Trinity, SC. Buck rules over his little kingdom with morbid humor and playfulness, setting up moral pitfalls and dilemmas for the town's inhabitants, and dispensing his own brand of justice or vengance or just plain meanness--which often involves ruin, insanity, dismemberment, or death.Opposing Buck is young Caleb Temple (played by Lucas Black), an orphan who talks regularly to his dead sister Merlyn and who has powers of his own--and who may or may not be Buck's son. Buck wants Caleb to follow him; Merlyn wants Caleb to resist; and the rest of Trinity gets caught in the crossfire, so to speak.The writing, acting, and directing are all outstanding. You'll never look at Gary Cole the same way again. Or, for that matter, Shaun Cassidy--yes, the ""Hardy Boys"" teen heart-throb [thanks for the corrections, everyone!]--who conceived and produced the show, along with Sam Raimi (""Evil Dead"", ""Army of Darkness"", ""Spider-Man"").",5,"""Someone's at the door...""",1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,1493,"['DVD', 'set', 'long', 'overdue', 'Loooong', 'overdue', 'recent', 'move', 'DC', 'Colorado', 'threw', 'out', 'recorded', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'ones', 'American', 'Gothic', 'Now', 'can', 'get', 'rid', 'well', 'right', 'reason.Like', 'Firefly', 'American', 'Gothic', 'unique', 'outstanding', 'series', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'network', 'CBS', 'case', 'was', 'also', 'probably', 'most', 'chilling', 'disturbing', 'series', 'ever', 'air', 'stark', 'morality', 'tale', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Devil', 'incarnate', 'close', 'kin', 'disguised', 'Sheriff', 'Lucas', 'Buck', 'small', 'town', 'Trinity', 'SC', 'Buck', 'rules', 'little', 'kingdom', 'morbid', 'humor', 'playfulness', 'setting', 'up', 'moral', 'pitfalls', 'dilemmas', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'dispensing', 'own', 'brand', 'justice', 'vengance', 'just', 'plain', 'meanness', 'often', 'ruin', 'insanity', 'dismemberment', 'death.Opposing', 'Buck', 'young', 'Caleb', 'Temple', 'played', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'orphan', 'who', 'regularly', 'dead', 'sister', 'Merlyn', 'who', 'powers', 'own', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Buck', 'son', 'Buck', 'Caleb', 'follow', 'Merlyn', 'Caleb', 'resist', 'rest', 'Trinity', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'so', 'speak.The', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', 'outstanding', ""'ll"", 'never', 'look', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'matter', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'yes', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'teen', 'heart-throb', '[', 'thanks', 'corrections', 'everyone', ']', 'who', 'conceived', 'produced', 'show', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'Spider-Man']",American Gothic: The Complete Series

The evil Sheriff Lucas Buck (Gary Cole) is evil incarnate, while his bastard son Caleb Temple (Lucas Black of Sling Blade) has to choose between him and his murdered sister Merilyn (Sarah Paulson), a ghost of good or a angel. It is the story of the struggle of good and evil within all of us, and it also shows that not everything is completely black or white, yet there is individuals more evil than good and vice versa, but even the bad have a little good in them. The show deals in folklore, myth, the supernatural, and it is very dark. Most people will not like this show as evidenced by it's cancellation. To many the last episode will be a major let down, no resolution but that wasn't the creator of the shows fault, it was the network CBS that canceled it not only that, when it was shown on TV it was constantly shuffled around and shown out of order with episodes that weren't even aired that even confused me as a viewer. They had plans to do another season that is why it seems there is no closure, one can only imagine what could've happened as endless fan fiction web sites have shown. There is commentary from the show's creator which is a bit lack luster and the episodes are out of order like on TV. The show seemed to come on at a time that Twin Peaks was going out on a low ebb but still influential and X Files the bastard child of the just mentioned show was on the rise, it seemed they tried to capitalize on the ""weird show"" craze. In my opinion they did a pretty good job of it, but they let the show die too early of a death and were very unfair in the way the treated it, it was as if they wanted the show too die. Too many networks back then and now let shows die instead of trying to find it a audience and let it grow, one season is not enough. If you like the otherworldly and weird this show is right up your alley but if your like the majority of Americans, this show will not appeal to you, you have to have imagination which most people lack. Aside from a ill advised character change out I think was out of their control, this show is a keeper and like Carnivale it makes you wish they had done more and if the show had been allowed to grow what potential it would've reached.

933701,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000ATQYXI,Cubist,"[5, 5]","American Gothic was the victim of lousy timing. When it debuted on network TV in 1995, it arrived too late to ride on the coattails of Twin Peaks' success and too early to ride the wave of popularity of shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. It also faced fierce competition from The X-Files which ultimately won out sending American Gothic and the underrated X-Files wannabe Dark Skies into pre-mature cancellation.Gothic was the brainchild of `70s pop icon Shaun Cassidy who was clearly influenced by David Lynch when he made this show as evident by the opening credits of small-town America accompanied by `50s era rock `n' roll music. However, as much as Cassidy is influenced by Lynch his show is also steeped in the rich tradition of southern gothic horror in the vein of William Faulkner's prose.Like Lynch did with Twin Peaks, Cassidy explores the incestuous-like secrets that plague a small-town. In an amusing running joke, it seems that almost everyone owes Sheriff Buck a favour in what were probably some kinds of Faustian pacts. The show never spells out what these were but only presents them as little asides when Buck greets a passerby on his way to somewhere else.When American Gothic aired the network had no idea how to market its funky blend of horror and magic realism and moved it around, showed episodes out of order and basically insured that no one but the dedicated few would stick with it. At the time people only wanted to see cop shows (NYPD Blue), sitcoms (Seinfeld) or medical shows (ER) and so it died an early death. But Cassidy has persisted and surfaced this year with a new genre show called Invasion, a modern take on Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It too focuses on a small-town filled with dark secrets. So far, this show has been a success so at least Cassidy's timing has improved.Each disc features a variety of deleted and extended scenes for various episodes.A real treat for fans is an audio commentary for the ""Pilot"" episode by Shaun Cassidy and producer David Eick. It's been ten years since they have seen this episode so it's a trip down memory lane for both of men. They point out all the cast who have since gone on to greater success and joke (sort of) about the troubles they had and the pressures imposed on them by the network who clearly did not understand what they were trying to do.",4,A victim of lousy timing.,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2352,"['American', 'Gothic', 'was', 'victim', 'lousy', 'timing', 'When', 'debuted', 'network', 'TV', '1995', 'arrived', 'too', 'late', 'ride', 'coattails', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'success', 'too', 'early', 'ride', 'wave', 'popularity', 'shows', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'also', 'faced', 'fierce', 'competition', 'X-Files', 'ultimately', 'won', 'out', 'sending', 'American', 'Gothic', 'underrated', 'X-Files', 'wannabe', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'pre-mature', 'cancellation.Gothic', 'was', 'brainchild', '70s', 'pop', 'icon', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'who', 'was', 'clearly', 'influenced', 'David', 'Lynch', 'when', 'made', 'show', 'evident', 'opening', 'credits', 'small-town', 'America', 'accompanied', '50s', 'era', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'music', 'However', 'as', 'much', 'Cassidy', 'influenced', 'Lynch', 'show', 'also', 'steeped', 'rich', 'tradition', 'southern', 'gothic', 'horror', 'vein', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'prose.Like', 'Lynch', 'did', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Cassidy', 'incestuous-like', 'secrets', 'plague', 'small-town', 'amusing', 'running', 'joke', 'almost', 'everyone', 'owes', 'Sheriff', 'Buck', 'favour', 'what', 'were', 'probably', 'kinds', 'Faustian', 'pacts', 'show', 'never', 'out', 'what', 'were', 'only', 'little', 'asides', 'when', 'Buck', 'passerby', 'way', 'somewhere', 'else.When', 'American', 'Gothic', 'aired', 'network', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'market', 'funky', 'blend', 'horror', 'magic', 'realism', 'moved', 'around', 'showed', 'order', 'basically', 'insured', 'one', 'dedicated', 'few', 'would', 'stick', 'time', 'people', 'only', 'wanted', 'see', 'cop', 'shows', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'sitcoms', 'Seinfeld', 'medical', 'shows', 'ER', 'died', 'early', 'death', 'Cassidy', 'persisted', 'surfaced', 'year', 'new', 'genre', 'show', 'called', 'Invasion', 'modern', 'take', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'too', 'small-town', 'filled', 'dark', 'secrets', 'So', 'far', 'show', 'been', 'success', 'so', 'least', 'Cassidy', 'timing', 'improved.Each', 'disc', 'variety', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'various', 'episodes.A', 'real', 'treat', 'fans', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'producer', 'David', 'Eick', 'been', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'episode', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'men', 'point', 'out', 'cast', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'greater', 'success', 'joke', 'sort', 'troubles', 'had', 'pressures', 'imposed', 'network', 'who', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do']",American Gothic: The Complete Series

For some reason the network chose to remove it during early 1997, then show about four episodes during the summer of 1997.This CD set contains all 22 of the completed episodes.  Unfortunately they are not presented chronologically in such a way that the viewer can watch the story unfold from start to finish.  As an example, the original doctor is confined to an asylum but is in one episode about four episodes later, then the other doctor is in the next one. This is just one example.As far as the series itself, I feel the creators had a good idea, but did not know what to do with it.  You are never quite sure if Sheriff Buck is the devil, an channel for evil influences, or a devil's disciple.  Then, here's Gail (Paige Turco) believing Buck was responsible for her parents' death, yet sleeping with Buck.  These are just two of the most obvious descrepancies in the series.The best thing about the series is Gary Cole as Sheriff Buck.  As a person who has followed the career of this most versitile of actors, I feel he deserves better star status.

I agree with others here that the dvd release is terrible - constantly having to switch disks to view the episodes in the correct order and having problems with skipping (although mine weren't as bad as others have had, but they were still annoying).  This was an excellent show and it should have been afforded a good dvd release.  The price for AG wasn't any less than for other one season releases, so Universal shouldn't have cut corners the way they did - that was a rip-off.  The show itself, however...  well, that's another story.  I'd have to say that of all the ""scary"" tv shows I've ever watched, this was the only one that actually scared me.  Most other such shows usually end up making me laugh because of their hokiness - not a problem with AG.  Plus, the combination of Paige Turco, Brenda Bakke and Sarah Paulson make Charlie's Angels look ugly.  This was an excellent, excellent show that shouldn't have been cancelled.  The one complaint about the show I would have (and it's also mentioned by the producers in their commentary) is that they had to rush the ending after they found out they weren't coming back the next year - not their fault, but I'm sure it would have been better if they had been given an earlier warning that they weren't being renewed.

933709,A1VE7UAKRR9KHQ,B000ATQYXI,"H. Stonehouse ""Yemanya""","[5, 6]","First things first, lets start with the negative aspects of this boxset.  For one things its on double sided discs, which are always a bit ish, because they tend to scratch easily.  Secondly, the special features are almost non-existant, some retrospective documentaries would've been welcome and lastly, the episodes are all mixed up (I won't waste your time giving you the correct order because some considerate reviewers have already done that).Now that all the bad points are out of the way, let me tell you why this boxset is still worth 5 stars, AMERICAN GOTHIC IS A WORK OF GENIUS! So good, in fact that I have been waiting 10 long years, for a copy on DVD.The main reason to watch is of course, Sheriff Lucas Buck (played to perfection by Gary Cole).  He is sort of devil's representative on earth and his charm and razor sharp dark humour is brilliant and personally speaking, I think he's gorgeous.  Anyone who has already seen the show will have realised that the title of this review is a nod towards when he first meets Gail Emory and introduces himself as 'Sheriff Buck, with a B', so that she spells it right when she writes about him.What is most enticing about the show, are the grey areas.  The Sheriff seems to only punish sinners, yet he is supposed to represent evil (could this mean that the town of 'Trinity' is hell) and the so called heavenly being (Caleb's dead sister, Merlyn) does some really awful stuff, which she says is 'in the name of God'. It turns out that it is for her own selfish reasons, which in my opinion makes her worse than Buck, at least with him it's 'what you see, is what you get'.  I think that it is maybe, the blurred boundaries and the fact that the wicked character was most appealing that got this show cancelled far too early.  Some viewers might not have grasped the point of the show, the fact that everything is not always black and white.I could ramble on forever about the merits of this show, but I won't, since everything is always a matter of personal taste, I urge any fan of contempory gothic horror and good plots to BUY THIS SERIES AND TRY IT FOR YOURSELF.

933717,A10872FHIJAKKD,B000ATQYXI,Just Bill,"[16, 16]","I agree with nearly all other reviewers: American Gothic is brilliant. I remember when the show debuted on TV. I was hooked from the first few episodes. But then I lost track of it (now I know why -- the network kept switching the airing days). So I was very pleased to see that it was released on DVD.My wife and I recently bought and watched the entire set within a couple of week's time -- but only after taking it back to the store twice because of faulty discs. These double sided DVDs are crap. They skip, freeze and have a habit of getting stuck at the most inopportune times. We're now on our third set. So far, so good. It skips less, but still isn't skip-free.Universal ought to be charged with some kind of crime for releasing such defective merchandise. Shouldn't we be contacting the Better Business Bureau about this? Shouldn't everyone who bought (and re-bought and re-bought) this DVD set lodge complaints against Universal?Moreover, shouldn't we as consumers stop buying anything released by Universal no matter what it is? If Amazon gets the idea that no one will buy Universal products from them maybe they'll demand higher quality before placing massive orders. That would definitely hit Universal where it hurts: in the pocketbook.Ultimately, it's not Universal's fault that they release crap. It's ours. We buy it, regardless. Amazon sells it, regardless. If Amazon and all of the consumers stopped buying Universal's defective garbage, they'd have to change its quality to be able to sell it. It's that simple.The only consolation I can take in all of this is that Universal must have received a flood of returns from all over the U.S. Serves them right.That said, I have to comment on the show itself. The acting is fantastic. The dialog is witty, often wry. Always very crisp. Although Gary Cole has gone on to bigger and better things in his career, I still like him best as Sheriff Lucas Buck. In this role, he is sublime.American Gothic is a very strange slice of television. It's spooky, quirky, funny and completely engrossing. Others have described the show in greater detail. I'll let you read their reviews to discover what the show is about.Even though I love the show, I hesitate to recommend the DVDs. If you do buy them, be prepared to return them endlessly until you chance upon a set that works.Let's start an anti-Unversal campaign to get them to release better merchandise! (Incidentally, I had the same problems with Universal's Kolchak: The Night Stalker.

933718,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B000ATQYXI,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[8, 8]","Every single genre fan knows what it is like to suffer that terrible sense of loss you can only undergo when one of your favorite television series has been cancelled, because it happens to us all the time! Its infinitely worse than a death in the family because shows of this calibre are a rarity and relatives are a dime a dozen--mine are at any rate. I'll bet that every one of you could sit down right now (well, you're probably sitting already, so scratch that) and make a list of ten shows that you loved with all your heart that never made it out of their first season. Am I right? Sure I am. My own list would include some real obscure shows like QUARK (about intergalactic garbage collectors), WIZARDS AND WARRIORS (it lasted 8 whole episodes!), STRANGE DAYS, EERIE INDIANA, WONDERFALLS, THE ADVENTURES OF BRISCO COUNTY JR., which is the only one that comes close to qualifying as a big success story, and last but not least AMERICAN GOTHIC. Now THERE was a real winner!AMERICAN GOTHIC  which aired in 1995 was the brain-child of Shaun Cassidy,(yes, that Shaun Cassidy) and was produced by Sam Raimi's Renaissance Pictures company. It was set in the fictional town of Trinity, South Carolina, and for 22 episodes it exposed the unsuspecting American public to more Evil and nasty goings on than they had any right to hope for. The town was aptly named for no matter what smaller stories seemed to be going on from week to week, there was always a greater story being played out in Trinity; Stories that involved Sheriff Lucas Buck played by Gary Cole with just the right amount of restrained leer and sneer. It was the  Sheriff was at the heart of everything the happened in Trinity. Did he just have the devil in him, or was he really The Devil? And where you found the Sheriff most often was hanging around young Caleb Temple (Lucas Black, from SLING BLADE), because it turned out that the Sheriff might actually be the orphaned boy's real father--and Buck just wanted to bring the boy into the family business. And where Caleb went you frequently found his sister Merlyn--even though she was murdered in the series' first episode, she was an angelic presence who still liked to hang around and try and guide Caleb down the right path. So Trinity literally has its very own version of the father, the son, and the holy ghost. Only in this case they were usually at each other's throats--in a genteel  sothern kind of satanic way. But make no mistake about it, if you have an appetite for the weird, the eerie, or a more plausible version of TWIN PEAKS, then this is the show for you.From the beginning AMERICAN GOTHIC was plagued by problems and found itself the center of controversy. In the first episode for instance Merlyn's murder was deemed too graphic and a long battle with network censor's ended in having the SOUND of her neck being broken removed from the soundtrack. Censors are strange animals, aren't they? You can see it, but you can't hear it. When they weren't battling the censor's they were having problems with scheduling, the series was constantly being bumped for this reason or that--furthermore episodes were being shown out of order. It was a mess. Four episodes were never shown period. The fact that the series managed to build up any fan base at all is nothing short of miraculous. But miracles do happen, and nearly everyone who watched this series became hooked on it and lived for the day when the DVDs would be released and they could finally see it the way it should be seen--in order and in its entirity!Of course, nothing is perfect. THE EPISODES ON THE DVD ARE NOT PRESENTED IN THE PROPER ORDER! They should be viewed as follows: 1.PILOT 2.A TREE GROWS IN TRINITY 3.EYE OF THE BEHOLDER 4.DAMNED IF YOU DO 5.POTATO BOY 6. DEAD TO THE WORLD 7.MEET THE BEETLES 8.STRONG ARM OF THE LAW 9.TO HELL AND BACK  10.THE BEAST WITHIN 11.REBIRTH 12.RING OF FIRE 13.RESURRECTION14.INHUMANITAS 15.THE PLAGUE SOWER 16.DOCTOR DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY 17.LEARNING TO CRAWL 18.ECHO OF YOUR LAST GOODBYE 19.STRANGLER 20.TRIANGLE  21.THE BUCK STOPS HERE  22.REQUIEMEpisodes of interest from a fannish perspective are #2 ""A Tree Grows in Trinity"" which features Arnold Vosloo who starred in Raimi's direct to video DARKMAN 2&3, as well as in HARD TARGET which Raimi produced for John Woo as his first American flick. #7 ""Meet the Beetles"" which stars Bruce Campbell as a cop who could never be able to come back for a sequel. And #19 ""Learning to Crawl"" in which Sam's brother Ted Raimi has a rather large part as a semi-vicious criminal who serves as an object lesson for young Caleb.AMERICAN GOTHIC'S current dvd release has discs with episodes on both sides. There is precious little in the was of special features--a few deleted scenes and some commentary from Cassidy on the pilot episode. Nonetheless its worth having because for the first time all 22 episodes are here, commercial free just waiting for you to discover them. Perhaps they are a bit heavy handed in some places, perhaps they are hindered by the limitations of tv special effects in the mid '90s, but none of that changes the fact that this series was an earth shaker was a sly, wicked sense of humor.

I went through two sets through Amazon and got my money back, then went through two sets at best buy and was able to persuade a manager to give me my money back.  In the process of temporarily owning all these sets, I watched the entire series, though some episodes skipped so poorly it was hard to continue watching, and the final episode had the entire first half cut off because the skipping was so horrible.  This release is pathetic.  No excuse.  Great show I'd love to own, but not this pathetic release.  This show could have been a huge DVD hit like Firefly ended up to be, a big profit for the powers that put it out, but they won't see that success because even suckers like me aren't going to invest in this set.  It was tempting to hold onto a flawed set, but I am hoping another run will be released, and I'll be able to grab a good set (but my hope is low this will ever happen).  I'd glady pay twice this price for a decent set.  I can handle out of order episodes (pathetic as that is that they'd release it this way), but I can't stomach all thefreezing.If you want some ideas for DVD sets to look into, look up Freaks and Geeks (far different genre, but well worth the money), The Shield (violent and intense, but I got so hooked), and Roswell (a fun series to watch).

The characters and storyline keeps you interested and spellbound.The main character, Sheriff Lucas Buck, does things that will make your skin crawl.  He can be very charming while seducing you into evil.  Gary Cole is an incredible actor, making this character all TOO real.  I love the scenes between Sheriff Lucas Buck and Ben, his deputy (played very well by Nick Searcy). Overall, the acting is great.  Every character comes to life. Even those that come back from death-like the Boston Strangler.The tone of this show is also well done.  Even with the dark turn throughout each episode, the lighting, scenery and sound often gives an air of lightness. An example of this is in the pilot when Sheriff Buck is walking back to the jail cells, whistling the theme of ""The Andy Griffith Show"".I loved this show when it first aired and I am pleased to have it in my collection.  It can be very addicting and you will not want it to end. Watching this series disturbed me at times but I wouldn't want it any other way.  The last two episodes, ""The Buck Stops Here"" and ""Requem"" will keep you on the edge of your seats.Buying this DVD set is worth the price. My only complaint would be the disorder of the episodes-it would have been nice to have the unaired episodes placed in order.

933724,A2ZY5IX8MDRJY7,B000ATQYXI,Lloyd J. Peasley,"[2, 2]","This ill-fated series contains some of the best-written (and delivered) dialogue you will ever hear on a TV show. It brings to mind some of the most literate scripts from 1940s movies (especially of the more Noirish kind) it's so witty, sophisticated, and unpredictable. A bon mot comes along every few lines or so; in fact it's worthy of ""All About Eve"" at its best. I've been bored by the mundane scripts of pretty well every modern TV show and this came as the most refreshing antidote.What's more, the actors' delivery of these lines is nigh on perfect, especially Gary Cole as the enigmatic Sheriff Lucas Buck and Brenda Bakke as the schoolteacher cum smalltown femme fatale. Cole's timing is about as good as I've ever heard from any actor and I kept on wondering why Bakke isn't more of a name she has so much presence.Still, there is a problem. Dramatically, this series is a bit of a mess. It sets things up nicely but then doesn't appear to know how to proceed. There are lots of half-digested ideas but not (until near the end when most of the original viewers were already lost) a satisfying meal. Threads are left hanging, episodes peter out, it's as if the writers are making it up as they go along. Then, with about six episodes to go it all starts to come together and you're left wishing the series could've gone on to a second season.One last thing: if you're looking for horror this probably won't please you. It's more black humour than fright night. Sheriff Buck is supposed to be evil incarnate according to some accounts but in many ways he's the hero of the story; he's the one who keeps the town together despite the odd body or two. AND he has most of the best lines.

Taking place in the small South Carolina town of Trinity, American Gothic focuses around young Caleb (Lucas Black, who appeared opposite Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade, and more recently in Friday Night Lights) who has a mysterious connection to the supernatural world and receives frequent visits from his dead sister Merlyn (Sarah Paulson).  The sheriff of Trinity, Lucas Buck (the teriffic Gary Cole) has set his sights on Caleb for his own reasons, as the viewer is shown how much control Buck has over the town and it's inhabitants.  Among the mix are a reporter (Paige Turco) and a doctor (Jake Weber) who are pawns in Buck's game, as the viewer is shown more and more that Buck may be either the most evil man walking the earth, or the devil himself.  Were it not for it's all too brief run, viewers could have seen that Buck is simply one of the most mesmerizing TV villains of all time, and the eerie settings and the great cast only make American Gothic all the sweeter.

933732,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000ATQYXI,OverTheMoon,"[12, 12]","`American Gothic', a TV series, is a supernatural drama consisting of 22 episodes, some of which where not aired during the original run. It ran on CBS for one year between 1995 and 1996. Its creator Sam Raimi had already worked on southern horror projects such as `Evil Dead I & II' and would later go on to direct the southern horror thriller `The Gift' before breaking box office records with his `Spider-man' series success. Southern horror is nothing new as Stephen King attests using some of his best works as an example, such as `The Stand'. We also have the `Children of the Corn' series (nobody said all southern horror was great), the works of David Lynch and `Frailty' to name a few of what is a whole DVD section unto itself. Apart from the modern `Carnivale' TV series it is hard to find southern horror outside of some `X Files' or `Twilight Zone' episodes. The most obvious parallel though is to Lynch and `Twin Peaks', and for those who enjoyed Peaks, then Gothic offers a slightly less satisfying but equally as interesting plot type.Gothic is about the town of Trinity, Deep South southern Carolina, that is home to what seems to be the devil himself in the guise of Sheriff Lucas Buck, who in the view of his deputies has never done an honest days police work in his life. Buck is creating illegitimate sons in order to sire his successor. Caleb Temple, an orphan, finds himself caught between his murdered sister's ghost pleas for revenge while a plot is hatched by Buck to turn Caleb to the dark side. Caleb's cousin, Gail Emory and local doctor Matt Crower, are determined to ensure that Caleb doesn't fall into the clutches of Buck's psychopathic fatherly lessons. The scene is set for explosive tension between this world and the next.American Gothic was aired out of the directors intended sequence by the instances of CBS who also refused to air some episodes.  The episodes ""Echo of Your Last Goodbye"" and ""Strangler"" where not aired. ""Potato Boy"" and ""Ring of Fire"" were aired out of sequence. This same inconsistent sequence is presented in the DVD box set. For this reason you need to know the intended viewing order before you watch the DVD. The intended viewing is - ""Pilot"", ""A Tree Grows in Trinity"", ""Eye of the Beholder"", ""Damned if You Don't"", ""Potato Boy"", ""Dead to the World"", ""Meet the Beetles"", ""Strong Arm of the Law"", ""To Hell and Back"", ""The Beast Within"", ""Rebirth"", ""Ring of Fire"", ""Resurrector"", ""Inhumanitas"", ""The Plague Sower"", ""Doctor Death Takes a Holiday"", ""Learning to Crawl"", ""Echo of Your Last Goodbye"", ""Strangler"", ""Triangle"", ""The Buck Stops Here"" and ""Requiem"".Compared to Peaks, Gothic is far more supernatural and slowly burned its way to a specific cult following that didn't generate any ground breaking ratings. A second season of Gothic did not appear, however when other stations aired Gothic in its intended order the ratings improved. The DVD series is also very popular. There are many reasons to believe that Gothic could have been made for extra seasons (what produ$er would not?) as there are some loose ends, but that is not to say that American Gothic does not stand alone as this mini-series, it does and it can. The only real onion is that one of the leads Dr. Crow (Jake Weber) left the show, or was written out, only a few episodes from the end. Apart from these minor production drawbacks American Gothic builds slowly but gains a lot of momentum towards the concluding episodes for a mind-blowing supernatural Abrahamic type finale on a staircase. If you like a good supernatural TV series and if you like originality with some of the best wit ever scripted and some serious dead pan sarcasm every split second, then look no further. And for those who boil at `CBS butchery' they can now own all of the Gothic episodes and watch it in the order it was meant to be viewed.",5,Well above average southern horror drama is worthy of any TV series collection,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,3852,"['American', 'Gothic', 'TV', 'series', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'consisting', '22', 'episodes', 'where', 'not', 'aired', 'original', 'run', 'ran', 'CBS', 'one', 'year', '1995', '1996', 'creator', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'had', 'already', 'worked', 'southern', 'horror', 'projects', 'such', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'II', 'would', 'later', 'go', 'direct', 'southern', 'horror', 'thriller', 'Gift', 'breaking', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'Spider-man', 'series', 'success', 'Southern', 'horror', 'nothing', 'new', 'Stephen', 'King', 'using', 'best', 'works', 'example', 'such', 'Stand', 'also', 'have', 'Children', 'Corn', 'series', 'nobody', 'said', 'southern', 'horror', 'was', 'great', 'works', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Frailty', 'name', 'few', 'what', 'whole', 'DVD', 'section', 'Apart', 'modern', 'Carnivale', 'TV', 'series', 'hard', 'find', 'southern', 'horror', 'X', 'Files', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episodes', 'most', 'obvious', 'parallel', 'though', 'Lynch', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Peaks', 'then', 'Gothic', 'slightly', 'less', 'satisfying', 'equally', 'interesting', 'plot', 'type.Gothic', 'town', 'Trinity', 'Deep', 'South', 'southern', 'Carolina', 'home', 'what', 'be', 'devil', 'guise', 'Sheriff', 'Lucas', 'Buck', 'who', 'view', 'deputies', 'never', 'done', 'honest', 'days', 'police', 'work', 'life', 'Buck', 'creating', 'illegitimate', 'sons', 'order', 'sire', 'successor', 'Caleb', 'Temple', 'orphan', 'caught', 'murdered', 'sister', 'ghost', 'pleas', 'revenge', 'plot', 'hatched', 'Buck', 'turn', 'Caleb', 'dark', 'side', 'Caleb', 'cousin', 'Gail', 'Emory', 'local', 'doctor', 'Matt', 'Crower', 'are', 'determined', 'ensure', 'Caleb', ""n't"", 'fall', 'clutches', 'Buck', 'psychopathic', 'fatherly', 'lessons', 'scene', 'set', 'explosive', 'tension', 'world', 'next.American', 'Gothic', 'was', 'aired', 'directors', 'intended', 'sequence', 'instances', 'CBS', 'who', 'also', 'refused', 'air', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'Echo', 'Your', 'Last', 'Goodbye', 'Strangler', 'where', 'not', 'aired', 'Potato', 'Boy', 'Ring', 'Fire', 'were', 'aired', 'sequence', 'same', 'inconsistent', 'sequence', 'presented', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'reason', 'need', 'know', 'intended', 'viewing', 'order', 'watch', 'DVD', 'intended', 'viewing', 'Pilot', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Trinity', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'Damned', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Potato', 'Boy', 'Dead', 'World', 'Meet', 'Beetles', 'Strong', 'Arm', 'Law', 'Hell', 'Back', 'Beast', 'Within', 'Rebirth', 'Ring', 'Fire', 'Resurrector', 'Inhumanitas', 'Plague', 'Sower', 'Doctor', 'Death', 'Takes', 'Holiday', 'Learning', 'Crawl', 'Echo', 'Your', 'Last', 'Goodbye', 'Strangler', 'Triangle', 'Buck', 'Stops', 'Here', 'Requiem', '.Compared', 'Peaks', 'Gothic', 'far', 'more', 'supernatural', 'slowly', 'burned', 'way', 'specific', 'cult', 'following', 'did', ""n't"", 'generate', 'ground', 'breaking', 'ratings', 'second', 'season', 'Gothic', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'however', 'when', 'other', 'stations', 'aired', 'Gothic', 'intended', 'order', 'ratings', 'improved', 'DVD', 'series', 'also', 'very', 'popular', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'believe', 'Gothic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'extra', 'seasons', 'what', 'er', 'would', 'not', 'are', 'loose', 'ends', 'not', 'say', 'American', 'Gothic', 'not', 'stand', 'alone', 'mini-series', 'can', 'only', 'real', 'onion', 'one', 'leads', 'Dr.', 'Crow', 'Jake', 'Weber', 'left', 'show', 'was', 'written', 'out', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'end', 'Apart', 'minor', 'production', 'drawbacks', 'American', 'Gothic', 'builds', 'slowly', 'gains', 'lot', 'momentum', 'concluding', 'episodes', 'mind-blowing', 'supernatural', 'Abrahamic', 'type', 'finale', 'staircase', 'like', 'good', 'supernatural', 'TV', 'series', 'like', 'originality', 'best', 'wit', 'ever', 'scripted', 'serious', 'dead', 'pan', 'sarcasm', 'split', 'second', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'who', 'boil', 'CBS', 'butchery', 'can', 'now', 'own', 'Gothic', 'episodes', 'watch', 'order', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'viewed']",American Gothic: The Complete Series

933736,A2PJUHNKHBDY27,B000ATQYXI,"SciFiCahill ""the researcher""","[2, 2]","American Gothic is set in the rural south lands of America, and brings to life the Hoodoo Voodoo atmosphere associated with that locale (much in the likeness of ""Skeleton Key"").  The main threat is one Sheriff Buck, who we learn is more than human - perhaps a demon or at the very least, under the control of one?  His main opponent is one of his own making - the spirit of an innocent girl who he, himself, brutally murdered.  The prize being fought over is the soul of the girl's younger brother, who, also, just happens to be Sheriff Buck's son.This battle of good vs. evil is anything but typical.  There are a number of twists and turns to keep one guessing.  And, along the way, we discover that no one is purely good or purely evil - that we always have both options at our command but, we don't always choose wisely.  Then, again, sometimes we do!American Gothic is just dark enough to be spooky, and still balanced enough to give faith more than even chance at victory.  This would be a great TV night contribution throughout October leading up to Halloween.  I'd recommend it for mature teens and adults.Others have rightly complained about the poor recording quality of the disks - that they stick, etc., and that the episodes are out of order - and they are right on both counts.

933738,A1ZZ2EB6FCY8MW,B000ATQYXI,"Staci L. Wilson ""Author: Animal Movies Guide ...","[189, 190]","Shaun Cassidy has a hit series on his hands right now with the alien-thriller Invasion, but ten years ago it was a harder row to hoe with his demonically-inspired weekly show American Gothic. At the time, CBS didn't give the series its due - they not only dropped entire episodes out from the middle of the story-line without ever airing them, they often preempted the show for weeks on end. After slapping the viewers' faces time and time again, CBS found that fans turned their TV attentions elsewhere.When it was airing, American Gothic was one of my favorite shows. And I've never quite forgotten it; it's one of those series like Twin Peaks or Carnivale - it's flawed but so compelling it haunts the memory for years. The story takes place in darkly wooded Trinity, South Carolina and centers on the imposing Sheriff Buck (Gary Cole) and his orphaned, (secret) illegitimate son, Caleb Temple (Lucas Black). The story-line is not especially unique but everything just gelled so perfectly with the actors and their characters, American Gothic qualifies as a classic.But how does it hold up? Despite some rather dodgy special effects and the occasional heavy-handedness, American Gothic holds up very well. It's much bolder and far more addictive than Cassidy's current Invasion, as a matter of fact. Some of the greatest little signature touches about the show include the catchphrase, ""Someone's at the door""; or the way Sheriff Buck always just shows up out of the blue as if dropping from the sky (or maybe coming up from someplace else); and Caleb's ever-furrowed brow and the way he said ""Daay-dy"".One of the best shows early on in the DVD is ""Meet the Beetles"" - it's a standalone episode and will remind many of an X-Files episode. The opener of the show is a bone-rattling bang when Caleb and his friend Boone are looking through the charred ruins of what was once Caleb's family home - a skeletal hand seemingly latches onto the boys' ankle and tries to pull him underground. Throughout the episode, Caleb is haunted by visions of his own grave.It turns out the remains belong to Hack Weller and that, even though he's been reduced to bones, the philandering husband has been dead for only two or three days. Much to the pithy Sheriff Buck's consternation, the State Police send square-jawed Lt. Drey (Bruce Campbell) in to solve the mysterious and potentially deadly case. It's an episode that will keep on ""bugging"" you even after the final fade.The actors would later go on to do other remarkable roles - Cole in Office Space; Black in Sling Blade; and Jake Weber in TV's Medium - but it's the genre-blending American Gothic that discerning horror fans will always remember them for.The DVD features deleted scenes and commentary on pilot episode from Cassidy and producer David Eick. Cassidy admits he hasn't seen the series since it aired 10 years ago, and too often it shows - there are some rather unfortunate long lapses of silence as he watches the show. There are a very interesting tidbits revealed; for example, Cassidy reveals that the ""Someone's at the door"" scene sold the pilot as he acted it out for CBS execs.The pair jokes about the prominent Elvis pillowcase shown in the pilot, and they complain about the stock music they were forced to resort to in certain sequences. They also mention wannabe Prez Bob Dole's then-ongoing anti-violence-on-TV campaign a few times, then they never utter a word about Dole during a scene in a which a certain character is found dead with an expensive writing instrument thrust into his windpipe (remember Dole's trademark pen?).Eick and Cassidy also talk about how producer Sam Raimi came in with a lot of visual ideas, and how he gleefully said that yes, Buck is the Devil (while Eick and Cassidy say they wished to keep the Sheriff's identity more ambiguous - however, one of them does laughingly say during the commentary, ""This is not Touched By An Angel - it's Touched By Satan!"").They don't go into too much detail about the show's cancellation, but Eick does say, ""We knew we were dead early enough to be able to plan our own funeral,"" in regards to being able to wrap up the loose ends in the series finale.It's absolutely wonderful to the have the American Gothic series on DVD, finally. However - be warned that the order of the episodes is not sequential and that there is nothing on the DVD package to indicate this. The four unaired episodes are piled on the last disc, but actually the show should be viewed in this order:PilotA Tree Grows in TrinityEye of the BeholderDamned if You Don'tPOTATO BOYDead to the

Gary Cole can't quite carry the load he has been given, and supporting roles are given less time because the latest victim must be introduced. The best 11 episodes make for a solid viewing experience, while the remainder seem like bland filler.

I'm watching them almost for the first time again and enjoying them as much as I did when they originally aired other than I can watch them a little faster than when they aired.  Gary Cole is one if my favorite actors and the character he puts into Lucas Buck is so mean but you love him anyway!!!!!,5,Great,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,344,"[""'d"", 'forgotten', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'series', ""'m"", 'watching', 'almost', 'first', 'time', 'again', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'other', 'can', 'watch', 'little', 'faster', 'when', 'aired', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'character', 'Lucas', 'Buck', 'so', 'mean', 'love', 'anyway']",American Gothic: The Complete Series

Well, once again I was wrong. This show is amazing, so far. I say that because I haven't finished it, but like most people on here, I'm wondering why it didn't get a second season.As for the intended order of viewing it, I'm trying to take each episode on its own terms, in other words, as seperate stories. I do however wish Dr.Crower could've stayed in longer. Kudos to Gary Cole for his subtly menacing role as the obviously evil Sherrif of Trinity. I do look forward to seeing how they wrap this up, hopefully some loose ends will be explained, we'll see.",5,the good vs. evil battle continues in American Gothic,1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,675,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'series', 'premiering', 'CBS', 'first', 'reaction', 'was', ""'oh"", 'boy', 'not', 'slasher', 'series', 'Well', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'wrong', 'show', 'amazing', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'finished', 'most', 'people', 'here', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'second', 'season.As', 'intended', 'order', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'trying', 'take', 'episode', 'own', 'terms', 'other', 'words', 'seperate', 'stories', 'do', 'however', 'wish', 'Dr.Crower', 'could', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'longer', 'Kudos', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'subtly', 'menacing', 'role', 'obviously', 'evil', 'Sherrif', 'Trinity', 'do', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'wrap', 'up', 'hopefully', 'loose', 'ends', 'will', 'be', 'explained', ""'ll"", 'see']",American Gothic: The Complete Series

933745,A2A60Y2HTOTNSX,B000ATQYXI,yourlibrarian,"[3, 3]","I have to agree with several other reviewers regarding the quality of the DVDs (stalling or stuttering during first-time play) and the efforts made to present this series appropriately.  The most confusing part is the episode order, which was done based on when the episode aired but not in what order the episode was written.  This is extremely unhelpful to anyone not highly familiar with the series.  While many episodes can stand on their own there is also a continuing storyline with the major characters which requires proper viewing order to be understood.It's a real shame as I have been waiting 10 years to see this series again as well as finally see the never aired episodes.  The deleted scenes rarely add anything to the episode that wasn't already there (in some cases adding only a few lines of dialogue) , and the commentary is unfortunately not a great addition either.  Co-producers Cassidy and Eick view the pilot for the first time since it was done and Cassidy spends most of it telling Eick to be quiet so he can watch the show.  It's a pity Eick wasn't doing it alone as he goes into more detail about locations, CGI use, wardrobe choices, network interference in the show, and casting choices but is constantly interrupted.Given the time it has taken to bring this to DVD, it may be worth taking a chance on this purchase (and make note above of the proper viewing order).  It's an interesting series with some fascinating characters and some really stellar episodes.  It's a shame we never got to spend more time with them.",3,Great show -- poor effort in DVD production,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,1548,"['have', 'agree', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'regarding', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'stalling', 'stuttering', 'first-time', 'play', 'efforts', 'made', 'present', 'series', 'appropriately', 'most', 'confusing', 'part', 'episode', 'order', 'was', 'done', 'based', 'when', 'episode', 'aired', 'not', 'what', 'order', 'episode', 'was', 'written', 'extremely', 'unhelpful', 'anyone', 'not', 'highly', 'familiar', 'series', 'many', 'episodes', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'also', 'continuing', 'storyline', 'major', 'characters', 'proper', 'viewing', 'order', 'be', 'understood.It', 'real', 'shame', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', '10', 'years', 'see', 'series', 'again', 'as', 'well', 'finally', 'see', 'never', 'aired', 'episodes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'rarely', 'add', 'anything', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'already', 'there', 'cases', 'adding', 'only', 'few', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'commentary', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'great', 'addition', 'Co-producers', 'Cassidy', 'Eick', 'view', 'pilot', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'Cassidy', 'most', 'telling', 'Eick', 'be', 'quiet', 'can', 'watch', 'show', 'pity', 'Eick', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'alone', 'more', 'detail', 'locations', 'CGI', 'use', 'wardrobe', 'choices', 'network', 'interference', 'show', 'casting', 'choices', 'constantly', 'interrupted.Given', 'time', 'taken', 'bring', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'taking', 'chance', 'purchase', 'make', 'note', 'proper', 'viewing', 'order', 'interesting', 'series', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'really', 'stellar', 'episodes', 'shame', 'never', 'got', 'spend', 'more', 'time']",American Gothic: The Complete Series
