688025,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005V9HN,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Triumph of the Spirit, 1989 filmThis movie is based on the experiences of Salamo Arouch, a Greek boxer who was sent to Auschwitz and survived. It tells about life and death in a Nazi concentration camp, and shows the horrors that are seldom mentioned on today's popular television (as if it was ancient history). This movie uses classic restraint, the horrors are off-screen. Those who were old and sick were sent to the extermination camp. The women were kept in a separate camp, their life was just as hard. Children were sent to a ""holiday camp"" and never seen again. A pregnant woman could be sent to a laboratory where neither baby or mother survived.Salamo's experience as a boxer lets him be used for entertainment, like musicians and others. He survives, but loses his brother and father. When a siren sounds a warning the guards and prisoners seek shelter. [I read that Auschwitz was never bombed because it was beyond the range of fighter escorts, and was not a prime military target.] There is an explosion that damages a furnace, the presumed guilty are shot. The prisoners hear rumors that the Russian Army is approaching. The healthy prisoners will be herded back to Germany, the rest will go ""up the chimney"". Then we learn ""its over"". The details of the liberation from Nazi rule are omitted. [Still too controversial?]The look and details suggest a European production, they would best know the facts. The names of the actors in the credits tell where this was produced (the actual location of Auschwitz-Birkenau). This was only one of the many concentration and extermination camps. Oswiecim was the headquarters and training grounds of the Polish Cavalry. Just as Theresenstadt was a Czecho-Slovak military base from the times of the Austrian empire. I think Auschwitz was the site of a synthetic fuel factory; it had coal, water, lime, and the very cheap labor needed as raw materials.This is the only film in English that is set in a concentration camp to tell about its horrors. ""Escape from Sobibor"" did not list the horrors as this film does. ""Playing for Time"" also was set in a concentration camp. They are worth viewing as a history lesson. Movies provide drama and entertainment, they won't replace history books. Concentration camps were a corporation's dream. They provided very cheap labor at a minimal wage, no medical costs or vacations, not even a pension. These films seldom mention the corporations that profited from their operations.",5,Surviving an Evil Empire,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,2471,"['Triumph', 'Spirit', '1989', 'filmThis', 'movie', 'based', 'experiences', 'Salamo', 'Arouch', 'Greek', 'boxer', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'Auschwitz', 'survived', 'life', 'death', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'horrors', 'are', 'seldom', 'mentioned', 'today', 'popular', 'television', 'was', 'ancient', 'history', 'movie', 'classic', 'restraint', 'horrors', 'are', 'off-screen', 'who', 'were', 'old', 'sick', 'were', 'sent', 'extermination', 'camp', 'women', 'were', 'kept', 'separate', 'camp', 'life', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'Children', 'were', 'sent', 'holiday', 'camp', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'A', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'could', 'be', 'sent', 'laboratory', 'where', 'baby', 'mother', 'survived.Salamo', 'experience', 'boxer', 'be', 'used', 'entertainment', 'musicians', 'others', 'brother', 'father', 'When', 'siren', 'warning', 'guards', 'prisoners', 'seek', 'shelter', '[', 'read', 'Auschwitz', 'was', 'never', 'bombed', 'was', 'range', 'fighter', 'escorts', 'was', 'not', 'prime', 'military', 'target', ']', 'explosion', 'damages', 'furnace', 'presumed', 'guilty', 'are', 'shot', 'prisoners', 'hear', 'rumors', 'Russian', 'Army', 'approaching', 'healthy', 'prisoners', 'will', 'be', 'herded', 'back', 'Germany', 'rest', 'will', 'go', 'chimney', 'Then', 'learn', 'details', 'liberation', 'Nazi', 'rule', 'are', 'omitted', '[', 'Still', 'too', 'controversial', 'look', 'details', 'suggest', 'European', 'production', 'would', 'best', 'know', 'facts', 'names', 'actors', 'credits', 'tell', 'where', 'was', 'produced', 'actual', 'location', 'Auschwitz-Birkenau', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'concentration', 'extermination', 'camps', 'Oswiecim', 'was', 'headquarters', 'training', 'grounds', 'Polish', 'Cavalry', 'Just', 'Theresenstadt', 'was', 'Czecho-Slovak', 'military', 'base', 'times', 'Austrian', 'empire', 'think', 'Auschwitz', 'was', 'site', 'synthetic', 'fuel', 'factory', 'had', 'coal', 'water', 'lime', 'very', 'cheap', 'labor', 'needed', 'raw', 'materials.This', 'only', 'film', 'English', 'set', 'concentration', 'camp', 'tell', 'horrors', 'Escape', 'Sobibor', 'did', 'not', 'list', 'horrors', 'film', 'Playing', 'Time', 'also', 'was', 'set', 'concentration', 'camp', 'are', 'worth', 'viewing', 'history', 'lesson', 'Movies', 'provide', 'drama', 'entertainment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'replace', 'history', 'books', 'Concentration', 'camps', 'were', 'corporation', 'dream', 'provided', 'very', 'cheap', 'labor', 'minimal', 'wage', 'medical', 'costs', 'vacations', 'not', 'even', 'pension', 'films', 'seldom', 'mention', 'corporations', 'profited', 'operations']",N/A

688027,A36IYF4FWA8MD8,B00005V9HN,an amazon fan,"[17, 29]","I am more disatified with nearly all the reviews then the movie itself. This boxer had basically become a specialized kapo. And if you don't know what a kapo is, it is a prisoner who turns against their own and gets more food and other things denied to the others. In slavery regarding the blacks, there were people who turned in their own relatives to have a better chance of not being a slave themselves. In Auschwitz and other death camps, some of the kapos started liking hurting and killing their own and some even were geniunelly pleased when Nazi overseer's praised them for their 'work'. I can understand this is probablyhuman nature at its worst and could hardly be helped, but how can this be a triumph of the spirit? It was a global tragady. If your going to make a movie about this boxer, why not make a movieof other kapos who were worse. Will the movie be called 'Triumph of the spirit again'? This boxer was lucky other Jews didn't kill him after liberation because fellow prisoners with 'lower'status killed some of the kapos after liberation for their betrayal to their own people. This was legally wrong, but once again, it was human nature for some, ie revenge or even a slight bit of personal justice. To roughly quote a Holocaust survivor, this is not meant to dishonor the prisoners who did bad things to fellow prisoners. It was a man-made society that failed miserably and utterly dishonored itself. I prefer seeing a movie referring to all the good things prisoners didfor others even sacrificing their lives for others in the camps, like the prisoner who didn't have to, but joined 200 children all alone in the gas chambers to comfort them while they were in horror and death. THAT type of example is truely 'Triumph of the Spirit' and if people can't see that, then this world is really in trouble.",4,UPSET,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,1826,"['am', 'more', 'disatified', 'nearly', 'reviews', 'then', 'movie', 'boxer', 'had', 'basically', 'become', 'specialized', 'kapo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kapo', 'prisoner', 'who', 'own', 'more', 'food', 'other', 'things', 'denied', 'others', 'slavery', 'regarding', 'blacks', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'turned', 'own', 'relatives', 'have', 'better', 'chance', 'not', 'being', 'slave', 'Auschwitz', 'other', 'death', 'camps', 'kapos', 'started', 'liking', 'hurting', 'killing', 'own', 'even', 'were', 'geniunelly', 'pleased', 'when', 'Nazi', 'overseer', 'praised', ""'work"", 'can', 'understand', 'probablyhuman', 'nature', 'worst', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'helped', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'triumph', 'spirit', 'was', 'global', 'tragady', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'boxer', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'movieof', 'other', 'kapos', 'who', 'were', 'worse', 'Will', 'movie', 'be', 'called', ""'Triumph"", 'spirit', 'again', 'boxer', 'was', 'lucky', 'other', 'Jews', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'liberation', 'fellow', 'prisoners', ""'lower'status"", 'killed', 'kapos', 'liberation', 'betrayal', 'own', 'people', 'was', 'legally', 'wrong', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'human', 'nature', 'ie', 'revenge', 'even', 'slight', 'bit', 'personal', 'justice', 'roughly', 'quote', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'not', 'meant', 'dishonor', 'prisoners', 'who', 'did', 'bad', 'things', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'was', 'man-made', 'society', 'failed', 'miserably', 'utterly', 'dishonored', 'prefer', 'seeing', 'movie', 'referring', 'good', 'things', 'prisoners', 'didfor', 'others', 'even', 'sacrificing', 'lives', 'others', 'camps', 'prisoner', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'joined', '200', 'children', 'alone', 'gas', 'chambers', 'comfort', 'were', 'horror', 'death', 'type', 'example', 'truely', ""'Triumph"", 'Spirit', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'then', 'world', 'really', 'trouble']",N/A

688030,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00005V9HN,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 4]","What you end up seeing here is not what was on the menu. Though not bad by any means, it lacks focus.Here's the scoop. Dafoe and his family are Jews who live in pre-WWII Greece. He's a formidible boxer, and when the Nazis round the family up, and throw them in Auschwitz, he ends up boxing for one of the upper-ups and takes on anyone they send into the ring. If he wins, his sponser wins money. If he loses, he is no longer of any use.This is based on a true story but there isn't much story here. A small amount of time is spent in the set up, showing family life before the Nazis for a few minutes. Then they show life as they are herded into a ghetto, then finally when they are sent to Auschwitz. When they arrive there the viewer gets an eyeful of life in a concentration camp. Though there might be a few new details and insights here it isn't much more than you've already seen a number of times.The box art and tag line make you think the story is wrapped around the boxing, when surprisingly little time is spent on it. He fights. He wins bouts. He gets better work assignments and eats a bit better than his fellow prisoners. But there's no struggle for him. He's a good boxer and his prowess isn't challenged to any great degree. And it does nothing to earn him his freedom. The Russians and Allies are getting closer so the Nazis just abandon the camp and the prisoners wander off.This isn't a bad watch by any means. All the acting is good. It's directed well enough and all the other production values are right on. One odd note was that there were scenes where two Germans would be speaking to each other in German, and there were no subtitles. And these weren't short conversations. WTF?!

688031,AMOVQSDE8OHHK,B00005V9HN,"HARKONNEN... Forever ""One Cannot Go Against T...","[6, 7]","As a child growing up I had to endure the sometimes mad and raving ramblings of my father who is a dyed-in-the-wool Holocaust revisionist and an admirer of all things German.  I was given a German name, a German godfather, and most of my relatives married Germanic people even though my family does not have an ounce of German blood at all.  So when I was going to school I was really confused and I thought to myself "" why don't I find out my own truth and not have my Father tell me things that HE believes are true, but are true to me? "" So in middle school I spent countless hours in the library ( which was brimming over with a wealth of informative and educational, ah, what America once was ) and I would choose many books on the Holocaust and WWII.  I picked up a book named "" A Nightmare In History "" and needless to say my life changed FOREVER.If such a thing such as the Holocaust actually NEVER ocurred as my Father and the countless Hitler lovers and Neo-Nazis in the world say never ocurred, then I truly despise being born a human being and inhabiting this sick and twisted world.  This was truly a soul-crushing, harrowing, nightmarish view of a world I knew about when I was a child being indoctrinated into believing it wasn't true but seeing it actually being brought to the silver screen was surreal and the most brutal, engaging, engrossing, and lividly disgusting depiction of what we as men do to our brothers and sisters.Without going into much detail there are things in this movie that will shock ANYBODY who can call themselves a person, no matter what horror or blood and guts movie they have ever seen.  The acting is solid and the affected relationship between father and son ( Willem Dafoe and Robert Loggia ) is truly heartbreaking and painful to watch.  When Salomo finally was forced to say goodbye to his Father I couldn't stop crying, it had to be one of the most painful scenes I have ever seen on a movie screen.  The last 10 minutes of the movie to me are the worst, bar none.  I won't give anything away, all I have to say is that this movie isn't a movie at all, it is more like a going through a time machine and waking up in a nightmare world where all you want to do is escape, and anybody who believes in God above has to know that although God allows such things to happen time and time again, be it in Rwanda, Cambodia, Germany, Poland, wherever and when it happens again ( as it most likely will somewhere ) there is a silver lining to ever story:  God is eternal just like the Jewish people, who have been much maligned and forced to suffer thoughout history for the faults and sins of their ancestors, and no matter how or why they have become who they are, no matter what you may think of them or any other race of people you admire or despise, we are all human, we are all brothers, we are all on this planet for a purpose, the purpose of being good, honest and decent people who were put here to live happy lives and love our neighbors and all the living creatures God put on this Earth.  I am a Christian and I try to love everybody equally, and although sometimes my inherent prejudices do come out ( because all of us have them, no matter what we may think ) I try to put myself in the other person's shoes and I try to remember that every man, woman and child on this planet has a soul, a spirit that can be uplifted or taken down, exalted or shattered, but it is always there and GUESS WHAT:  NO MAN IS BORN EVIL, I TRULY BELIEVE THAT.  The world has a way of making men evil, but all of us have a chance to redeem ourselves and try to make the world a place that we can enjoy to live in.

To think that human beings did such horrible things to their own kind is truly horrific to even begin to try and understand. This film, actually shot inside Auschwitz is another sobering reminder of the horrors that took place in the Nazi death camps. Though the film makes the whole shocking event of the holocaust look rather tame compared to what historical records, testimony and images have proven, it was effective enough to imagine how truly horrible it really was to exist in such unthinkable circumstances. This film while not as realistic as Schindler's list, it does examine the horrible living conditions and day to day misery that prisoners of Auschwitz had to endure. It's clearly a watered down version that doesn't begin to convey how horrifying living conditions there were really like anyway.

The concentration camp situation has been seen in film many times (The Grey Zone), but this movie throws in the ""boxing for survival"" piece, and thanks to Willem Dafoe's incredible acting the movie becomes distinctive.  With boxing being more a sport of survival than one of competition, I thought the story a perfect metaphor for the overall jewish holocaust survivors.  Not only does a boxer fight against a crafty and often cruel opponent, but he must fight the urge of his own body and soul crying out to him to quit and give up the fight.Triumph of the Spirit strips back the flesh to reveal that crying soul doing whatever he or she has to in a situation where only the strong and enduring survive.Great performances by veteran actors Edward James Olmos and Robert Loggia. There are hidden moments in this film where the all-seeing human spirit is silently captured in the eye contact between the actors.  It is in these exchanges that I felt the truest impact and challenge the holocaust had on these victims and their oppressors.

688038,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005V9HN,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","Having watched numerous Holocaust movies, I had put off watching ""Triumph of the Spirit"" because I had wrongly assumed that the movie's primary focus was on boxing, even though it was centered in that most notorious of all concentration camps, Auschwitz. Well, I finally decided to watch it last night, since it is a fact-based Holocaust drama and I was very impressed at the credible portrayal of the main character, Salamo Arouch by actor Willem Dafoe.The movie is actually quite subtle for a Holocaust drama - many of the horrors awaiting the Jewish victims at the extermination camp Auschwitz are subtly portrayed. One scene is especially horrific to me - masses of Jewish Greeks clapping when the Nazis declare they are to be given hot showers before being reunited with their loved ones...and then walking down the steps taking them to the gas chambers where they would be murdered en masse. The murder scenes are not portrayed - but the innocence of these hapless victims, who could not possibly comprehend the evils the Nazis were capable of just struck me to my very core.Salamo Arouch finds himself in this living hell that is Auschwitz - separated from his sweetheart Allegra (Wendy Gazelle who like other able women was housed in a separate camp, Birkenau), but together with his father (Robert Loggia in a particularly noteworthy performance) and younger brother, tries to survive day to day until his boxing prowess attracts the attention of a senior Nazi officer who promptly gets him to participate in matches where the Nazi officers bet big bucks and where the winner is lucky to be rewarded with an entire loaf of bread. Salamo realizes this is his chance for earning extra rations (in a camp like Auschwitz starvation is rampant) though he is also aware that the risks are high.The movie is interesting (at least for me) because it provides insights into the social structure of the camp - there are the Nazi officers who basically lounge around enjoying the spoils of their victims; the Kapos who are brutal in carrying out the orders by the Nazis, even if it means brutalizing their own people; and of course the prisoners themselves who are treated as sub-humans or less. Edward James Olmos is compelling in his portrayal of a Gypsy Kapo who is merciless and brutal, but who eventually softens and forms a subtle rapport with Dafoe's Arouch.Though Arouch's story is at the heart of the drama, there is another secondary narrative revolving around the plight of Arouch's sweetheart, Allegra who together with her sister tries to stay alive, not knowing if Arouch is still alive. The situation in the women's camp appears even more desperate as the women fight with each other over a piece of bread and even shoes, turning on each other almost bestially in order to survive. This matches with my own reading of history books which portray the situation in Birkenau as unimaginably desperate.Those who are familiar with the Holocaust will appreciate some of the subtler aspects of the story such as Salamo's brother's fate when he refuses to be part of a work detail cleaning up the gas chambers and carrying out corpses - the work detail referred to here is the Sonderkommando which comprised able-bodied men who were literally condemned to carry out the most gruesome task of disposing of the bodies of victims murdered in the gas chambers - and who were provided good rations, though due to the nature of the work, they were rotated and sent up the chimneys themselves after a short period.""Triumph of the Spirit"" is a compelling Holocaust drama that portrays the tenacity of the human spirit under the most deplorable conditions.
