Check. Fresh new lead actress (Gina Carano) who is a real life mixed-martial artist that does her own stunts? Check. Well known/dependable supporting cast? Check. David Holmes ofOcean's Elevenfame even did the soundtrack, yet somehow that went wrong too.This is a spoilerless review, and if you want to get a sense of the plot the main Amazon review above does a fine job. The movie itslef gets stuck sometimes trying to be a modern day version of the 70s tv show ""Baretta"", while other times attempting too much Bond like international intrigue. The end result comes across as mixed genres and ultimately falls flat.Towards the end Carano has her longest fight scene of the film, set on a gorgeous beach as the sun begins to set. What could have been a great opportunity to showcase her talent instead comes off as terribly staged and hokey. You know she could really kick your butt, and maybe it's partially because Ewan McGregor looks like he couldn't defend himself against an overly aggressive girl scout, but everything from the multiple cutaways to the lighting is wrong. This is arguably supposed to be the dramatic conclusion, but when the scene is shown from a multitude of angles it comes across more like the director is desperately trying to find the one shot that might actually work. Other parts of the movie feel the same way, including a very cardboard like performance by Bill Paxton as Carano's father.Worth seeing once? Maybe, it does have several good moments early on, and Carano is a real talent we'll no doubt see again. A good rookie effort for sure.

It has some moments reminiscent of Ocean's 11; you can tell that this film was lovingly crafted when it came to the soundtrack, scenery, editing, and all the other little things that take a movie from good to excellent. The story was compelling and very clever. It's a smart movie. You have to do a little work to put the pieces together, but it's worth it and makes it that much more enjoyable.What I loved most is that the actress who plays Mallory, the protagonist, looks like a REAL secret agent would look--muscular curves, practical clothes, minimal makeup. There's a great scene of her relaxing while cleaning her gun and drinking a glass of wine with her hair tied up in a scarf. That's me every night (sub out the gun for a book though, lol)! Moreover, Mallory gets the job done without heavy reliance on her sex appeal although she definitely has it. When she gets down to business she's kicking butt in boots, not running around flailing wildly on five inch heels. The supporting cast is great as well, and it's wonderful to see a movie where men regard the female character as their equal (or better) without trying to put her in her place.Gina Carano more than holds her place among more seasoned actors.

After an assignment in Barcelona, Mallory goes to Dublin, supposedly on a cakewalk assignment, only to find that she's been betrayed.  Trying to piece together the nature of and motivation for the betrayal is probably more challenging for the viewer than for Mallory.  Fortunately for the viewer, Mallory makes the improbable decision to tell her story to a random stranger whose car she steals while making one of her getaways from the people who are trying to kill her.Apart from being hard to follow, the direction of Haywire is a little too gimmicky.  Choppy editing is intended to convey a sense of edginess.  Action scenes frequently shift between sepia-tinted frames, black-and-white frames, washed-out frames, and normal-colored frames.  I suppose it's interesting to watch but it's all been done before.  Steven Soderbergh has done it all before, and he's clearly capable of better things.If you like chases, shootouts, and fistfights -- and who doesn't? -- Haywire has plenty to offer.  There are some wicked fight scenes that are enough to make the movie worth watching.

You don't get engaged like you do with Bourne identity.

1529480,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B007C4ZJ0S,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Gina Carano is a terrible actress.  Outside of that, `Haywire' is a fun ride.  It is a little choppy and at times slightly nonsensical, but in the vein of Soderbergh's other stylized thrillers (like `Ocean's Eleven') this works rather well.  It has a huge ensemble that all hold their own and it has a sharp attention to detail that makes for a lot of thrilling scenes (THIS is how you shoot an action sequence) and yet when all is said and done it makes a minimal impact and thus becomes largely forgettable.  This isn't a film you'll remember for a long time, despite merit in some respects.This basically follows a rogue black ops soldier, Mallory, who was sold out by someone close to her and is on the run for her life covering up someone else's mistake.  We open with her beating the tar out of Channing Tatum and then explaining how she got there, which then leads into flashbacks of her beating the tar out of Michael Fassbender and then eventually beating the tar out of Ewan McGregor.As a tool for physical violence, Carano works very well, but when she is given dialog to spew or emotions to portray, she winds up feeling so forced and so calculated that she distracts from the movie.  They should have found a better actress and just used Carano to do the stunt work.  Still, the rest of the cast (especially Fassbender and a shady, bearded, Banderas) shine in their respective roles, and Soderbergh really directs this with finesse and captures all the action marvelously.

It's an action film with a story that's nothing new, but it's serviceable, and it's perfect if you're looking for something to just pop in, sit back and relax and enjoy.Gina Carano is Mallory Kane, a mercenary who is set up for a murder and finds herself the target of her own mercenary contract company and, unlike the audience, she's not going to take that sitting back. The story's been done before and from the onset, we can pretty much guess who the dastardly, double-crossing bad guys are, but Soderbergh manages to keep us engaged with a brisk pace and some nice, unexpected, little twists.Acting-wise, the A-listers (McGregor, Tatum, Fassbender etc.) competently pull off their roles as you would expect them too. For a newcomer, Gina Carano also holds her own with what she is given; she's sexy, dangerous and in control and it gives her a strong screen presence. When she jumps into action, running, climbing, kicking ass, she delivers as good as she gets...move over Jason Statham.Speaking of action, it's fast and brutal. There are fights, shoot-outs, car chases...the works. I'm thankful that Steven Soderbergh keeps the camera still with little cutting during action so I can actually track what's going on, it's not that I don't appreciate the in-the-action handheld style of shooting that directors so love to use these days, but if you've got a well-choreographed hand-to-hand fight, I want to see it, not bits and pieces because of jarring camera work.It's not perfect - I still have some questions about the plot - but 'Haywire' is a fun ride. Carano's an enjoyable leading lady to watch, the action is hard-hitting and Soderbergh adds some real flair with his direction and cinematography work to what would've been a by-the-numbers action movie in the hands of anyone else.

She's a good actress and a phenomenal fighter. Not to mention, she's a phenomenal fight/actor as well. In fact, ""HAYWIRE"" has tremendous action scenes and tremendous fight scenes. The movie as a whole though, has many problems.Carano, rooted in Mixed Martial arts, is new to acting, but this movie alone proves that she has a career in it. She holds her own and she is far from the problem with this film. She is exactly what she is supposed to be in this film, a top secret operative named Mallory Kane who lives for the job and is such a force to be reconed with that even the men in her business don't want to mess with her. Many of her scenes are just plain action movie eye candy, and I'm not talking about her beauty. There is a fight in a hotel room, a scene where she is fleeing from heavily armed police men and a scene where she is pinned down on a snowy road in the middle of the woods and many more.These are all great scenes, but the movie as a whole just doesn't have any meat to it. When a movie can be explained by simply calling it a ""revenge flick"". It's too simple. Especially these days. That's what it is. No more needs to be said. It isn't enough to have a bunch of cool action scenes thrown together for the purpose of serving one objective. Audiences are too smart these days and the actors in this film (McGregor, Douglas, Banderas, Fassbender, Carano & 'yes' even Tatum) are better than this.After watching Carano participate in many hand to hand fight scenes to go through her objective, which were all cool, It began to get tiresome. We know that Carano can fight and fight/act, but on one of her ""revenge"" scenes, instead of taking care of something quickly and steathly, we have to endure another unnecessary fist fight. As good as she is 'supposed to be', I would think a long unnecessary exchange of fists would be frowned upon if unavoidable.

The first action scene in the diner is shocking at first, the viewer is alarmed that a woman is being brutalized in such force in public with just a couple feeble attempts to help by the other patrons...but keep watching and you'll see she's not going to take it! She returns the brutality in triple force. Michael Fassbender and Ewen McGregor are favorites of mine and I also enjoyed their performance. In my opinion, the movie slowed down a tad too much in some areas, but in the words of the talented screenwriter Nick Kazan (and probably several others) 'Perfection is the Enemy of Art'. Just because I didn't get the pace in a couple areas doesn't mean it doesn't fit. Overall, I think it's a great action film and the fight scenes are done really well (made me wince more than once).

For a pro muay thai and mma female fighter to star in it, they should have had much better fight scenes although the grappling scenes aren't bad. The only thing that saves this movie remotely at all is that Gina Carano is so pretty and smoking hot. I would not call her a ""beauty queen"" in any way but there is just something about her that is so attractive and very womanly and tough. She has  a very pretty face. But on the quality of this movie it reminded me of some kind of mission impossible copy or Angelina Jolie spoof for an upcoming action beauty.There is a lot of action, suspense, fighting, stunts and like I said decent plot, but altogether I think it would have been a magnifiscent movie if they got someone who knew how to use the mixed martial arts bombshell, like a female steven seagal/chuck ""chick"" norris/, or jean-claud. In some areas I want to give this movie 5 stars and in others one star so I'll end up with 3 stars or 4 if in kind spirits. NOt bad for her ""blockbuster"" movie debut..at least that I've ever seen her in(i know she's been in others but i've never heard of them or seen them). Gina carano is stunning though. A starlett that keeps your attention lol. I would fail this movie in terms of giving it a passing grade, but all in all considered it was not a bad movie and not a bad breakthrough performance for her. All the other supporting actors were tremendous! B+. She also reminds me or kind of looks like rachel leigh cook. I was a little disppointed we didn't get to see more of her athletic ""form."" I also was very shocked and astounded to learn of her extensive fighting background because until I looked her up on wikipedia I though this woman never fought in her life and never acted in any movie. To my suprise she both has acted and starred in many movies, and was a pro muay thai fighter and then a mma fighter as well as an american gladiator (crush) lol. I then changed my whole view to bad fight scene producers and choreographers who didn't bring there ""A"" game. If they can make angelina jolie look good, they definitely can make an undefeated (i cancel her fight with santos due to steroids) mma fighter look fabulous. I am definitely looking forward to her in future roles when they will give her better fight scenes and more close-ups of how beautiful she is!!!

It's not all bad.  There are a couple of nice moments of action; and the cast - at least in concept - is good.  Gina Carano acquits herself respectably. The role does not require great acting of her (and is therefore likely a good first film role, one on which she can cut her acting teeth), and she is more than able to handle the physical demands that the role requires.  In that sense, she is the best performer in this movie.But as for the rest...  Sigh. The film is nominally director Steven Soderbergh's stab at genre storytelling.  Not a bad thought - at least not initially.  I like genre storytelling, and action movies; and if you happen to make a noir-infused action movie, all the better.  (Soderbergh seems to have been striving for the latter here.)  Better yet - in theory, again - Soderbergh isn't a stranger to genre moviemaking.  The Ocean's films, after all, are essentially glossed-up heist movies, and I enjoyed them to varying degrees.But this film doesn't work.  A good action film - even a slow-burn, noir-ish, `thinking persons' actioner like this one wants to be - should have a palpable sense of forward momentum.  Alas, this film never seems to build any.  Aside from Carano, the performances have a certain laziness to them; actors like Michael Douglas and Ewan McGregor sleepwalk through their roles.  Only Antonio Banderas seems to have any spark, but even then I'm not sure that it wasn't simply the same glimmer of charm that he always has.Finally, a caveat: except in rare circumstances, I'm still not sold on the overall look of films shot on digital cameras, as 'Haywire' has been. I know that digital may well be the future of cinema, but right now I feel that the format imbues the final products with a rather unfinished aspect; an end result that occasionally feels to me less like cinema and more like old fashioned video.  Soderbergh has been working with digital for some time now and so is better practiced at concealing this aspect than most, but there are still moments when I feel that 'Haywire' looks unpolished.",2,Two-and-a-Half Stars - A Bit of a Disappointment,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2199,"['Hmmm', 'Well', 'liked', 'concept', 'least', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'much', 'else.Okay', 'perhaps', 'unduly', 'dismissive', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'couple', 'nice', 'moments', 'action', 'cast', 'least', 'concept', 'good', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'respectably', 'role', 'not', 'require', 'great', 'acting', 'therefore', 'likely', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'role', 'one', 'can', 'cut', 'acting', 'teeth', 'more', 'able', 'handle', 'physical', 'demands', 'role', 'sense', 'best', 'performer', 'movie.But', 'rest', 'Sigh', 'film', 'nominally', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'stab', 'genre', 'storytelling', 'Not', 'bad', 'thought', 'least', 'not', 'initially', 'like', 'genre', 'storytelling', 'action', 'movies', 'happen', 'make', 'noir-infused', 'action', 'movie', 'better', 'Soderbergh', 'have', 'been', 'striving', 'latter', 'here', 'Better', 'yet', 'theory', 'again', 'Soderbergh', ""n't"", 'stranger', 'genre', 'moviemaking', 'Ocean', 'films', 'are', 'essentially', 'glossed-up', 'heist', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'varying', 'degrees.But', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'even', 'slow-burn', 'noir-ish', 'thinking', 'persons', 'actioner', 'one', 'be', 'should', 'have', 'palpable', 'sense', 'forward', 'momentum', 'Alas', 'film', 'never', 'build', 'Aside', 'Carano', 'performances', 'have', 'certain', 'laziness', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'sleepwalk', 'roles', 'Only', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'have', 'spark', 'even', 'then', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'simply', 'same', 'glimmer', 'charm', 'always', 'has.Finally', 'caveat', 'rare', 'circumstances', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sold', 'overall', 'look', 'films', 'shot', 'digital', 'cameras', ""'Haywire"", 'been', 'know', 'digital', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'future', 'cinema', 'right', 'now', 'feel', 'format', 'final', 'products', 'rather', 'unfinished', 'aspect', 'end', 'result', 'occasionally', 'less', 'cinema', 'more', 'old', 'fashioned', 'video', 'Soderbergh', 'been', 'working', 'digital', 'time', 'now', 'so', 'better', 'practiced', 'concealing', 'aspect', 'most', 'are', 'still', 'moments', 'when', 'feel', ""'Haywire"", 'looks', 'unpolished']",N/A

Yep, it's that simple.  You've seen/read/heard the story a dozen times before, and that's only if you aren't a fan of the spy genre.  The structure is slightly unique--the story is told in flashbacks, anchored by a ""present tense"" scene involving Mallory dictating her story to a reluctant passenger (RED STATE'S Michael Angarano).  But even this nonlinear structure is a bit tired by now, and honestly most of the story could've benefited from a straightforward approach.Why should you watch HAYWIRE then?  Because it's a film by Stephen Soderbergh, a filmmaker so utterly devoted to his craft, he's threatened to retire from it (yeah, one of ""those"" auteurs).  Sarcasm aside, Soderbergh knows what he wants, and he almost always delivers.  HAYWIRE isn't intended to be anything original; and it's not.  It's a straight-up action film, full of those twists and fight scenes and menacing baddies that all action films feature, but filtered through Soderbergh's well-honed lens.  The cinematography is perfect; the fight-scenes are flawlessly choreographed, with no weird cuts or music to take away from the brutal punches and shattering glass.  These are real people doing real stunts.  Yep, just like it used to be.Soderbergh's choice of star is well-intentioned and mostly on-cue.  Gina Carano isn't an actress, and it shows; but then, she rarely has to do much acting, and certainly no actor could do her stunts quite like she can.  That's obviously clear in the fight scenes between the likes of Michael Fassbender and Channing Tatum: both actors bring their best (and Tatum's best is surprisingly good), and while they can act circles around Carano any day, they can't hold their own in the ring with her.  Also bearing some of the acting burden are Ewen McGregor (a decent villain), Michael Douglas (barely there but always welcome), Bill Paxton (again, little to do, but he does it well), and Antonio Banderas (who, with the best one-liner in the film, proves he's still a contender, and not just an animated bee or cat).

The problem lies solely on the shoulders of director Steven Soderbergh.Soderbergh is known for strong female leads and likes to make smart movies.  A movie featuring an ex-MMA fighter as a betrayed agent out for revenge almost can't fit that second part.  What should have been a fast paced, sexy action movie featuring lots of fight scenes and gunplay (which is what the previews make it look like!) is instead a plodding, lumbering dinosaur of a movie that just never gets up and goes.Ultimately the movie is just boring.  The gunfights are stilted and disappointing.  The fight scenes are all the same: Carano gets hammered by which ever man she's fighting in this 10 minute segment until she lands one big spectacular shot that turns the tide and allows her to end the fight.  The only moment of excitement comes during the car chase scene more than halfway through the movie.  Too bad that scene only lasts about 2 minutes.Ultimately Carano is a likable and able rising action star.

The start of the of movie was good, it had some good fighting scenes and then our main character Mallory Kane somehow enchants a boy to drive away with her in his car. So the story begins here, the boy asks questions about why she's being attacked. The flashback begins as Mallory Kane explains the story to the boys about her adventures in Europe and how her company double-crossed her. Basically after her story, the boy just leaves the story.  There were a lot of chase scenes which i think were just too long and it doesn't help that it's accompanied by cheesy jazz music. The dialogue between characters were just dry and boring and I'm sorry but the character who play Mallory can't act. The action scenes were cool but executed as if they were still in training. We don't find out who the real bad guys are until near the end of the movie. Mallory has made it her life's mission to hunt down her boss, Kenneth, after she realized he set her up. But instead of telling us, how she tracked him down, they showed a scene of Kenneth on the beach and Mallory on the side of beach just running up to him to beat the crap out of him.

That she did her own stunts is less impressive because it is to be expected from someone with her background.  Casting her in a feature film where she's allowed to utilize her expertise and not much else is nothing short of a gimmick.  This project was fabricated solely to showcase her talent.  It was populated with no less than six ""names"" in bit parts to help give her and this film some credibility.  The story is paper thin and easily summed up in a single sentence with the tagline: why bother.I was not impressed.The problem with this film is that the person with the most screen time should have been allotted the least.  When Carano isn't beating the crap out of someone, the film stalls.  She has no charisma, no natural charm, she doesn't evoke mystery; she simply stands there and recites her lines by rote.  A lamppost could spark more interest.  It was annoying how little effort she put into the non-action sequences.  Not that she was entirely to blame; this movie was little more than a bunch of fight scenes strung together.  Nothing about this movie surprised me.  In the end, I was glad I checked it out of the library rather than waste any money on it.I won't say it was the worst action flick I'd ever seen, it would have had to work a lot harder to gain that distinction.

Each person will interpret a book, movie, game, or album in a different fashion, unique to their experience. Therefore, no review (mine or otherwise) is a definitive judgment on a piece of media; it is simply one opinion of many. Please keep that in mind while reading reviews, and do not post angry comments because you disagree with a review's perspective (just because we're hidden by online anonymity does not mean that rules of courtesy do not apply). Level-headed comments or questions are welcome. Customer reviews are my way of making a small contribution to the Amazon community, instead of simply consuming media without offering honest feedback. On to the review:The film stars Gina Carano as a mercenary for hire (Mallory), who is betrayed by her employers, and must subsequently go on a revenge binge in order to find justice and answers alike. The plot of ""Haywire"" is threadbare, to be sure. But I don't have any problem with that. The problem is that it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, and it's hard to get invested in the characters or their plight.Some of the acting is excellent (Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas, in limited roles), but much of it is a bit stilted (Carano and Paxton). Particularly awkward is the dialogue between Mallory and her father, as they exchange wooden lines as if reading from cue cards.An interesting technique the director used was to kill all music during fight scenes. The results are mixed. At times, it adds a level of tension and reality to the scenes. However, if you're going to try to pull this off without using music or special effects, you better be really, REALLY good at choreographed fighting. Carano's stage combat is at times convincing, but at others, looked a little silly (like jumping off a wall to kick somebody in the head, ""Underworld"" style). However, this is apparently Carano's first film, so I can't be too hard on her, and this would more the director's responsiblity than the actor's.This is a decent action/spy/revenge movie to entertain you for an evening, with a rather subdued quality to it.

Surely there must be a reason because if they had read the script (which could have been more than two or three pages of lines in length!) they would have seen that there is no plot to speak of - just a series of poorly executed incidents, each they response to a newly identified character whose background is so ignored that we are left without a clue as to how the characters are interrelated. Lem Dobbs is credited as `writer' and the big surprise is that this is a product of Steven Soderbergh's direction.The plot is summarized as follows: `Beautiful freelance covert operative Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is hired out by her handler to various global entities to perform jobs which governments can't authorize and heads of state would rather not know about. After a mission to rescue a hostage in Barcelona, Mallory is quickly dispatched on another mission to Dublin. When the operation goes awry and Mallory finds she has been double crossed, she needs to use all of her skills, tricks and abilities to escape an international manhunt, make it back to the United States, protect her family, and exact revenge on those that have betrayed her.'The supporting cast, most of the characters are so ambiguous that we forget their names, is carried out by such fine actors as Michael Angarano, Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, Maximino Arciniega, and some other very talented but misused actors.

People giving this film negative reviews are simply people who don't get the movie and subscribe to mindless fodder like the Fast and the Furious franchise and Top Gun to get their action movie fix. This film is paced like an actual film and not some s&%@ action movie with a bunch of close shots of people fighting hand to hand with quick cuts and edits. What Ronin did with car chases, this movie does with hand to hand fight scenes. The plot lays on a bit thick and does not cater to people who aren't paying attention, no one over acts and Gina Carano isn't the terrible actress people make her out to be. If you can sit through Jessica Alba or Angelina Jolie, then you shouldn't complain about Gina. The music is in the vein of Lalo Schifrin (Bullit, Enter the Dragon) with a very 1970's style score which really adds to the movie. It's shot with digital cameras which allowed for the film to be shot without artificial light which adds to the very cool aesthetic and look of the lighting for the film. While there isn't a fight scene every ten minutes, when they do happen they hit hard and are brutal.

The ""Let's make it jump all over the place confusing."" technique is to show how intelligent the writer and director are while keeping the audience guessing about what's going on for as long as possible. Poorly thought out e.g. in the beginning she's doesn't take or disable her pursuer's car so that he can't chase her but grab's some stranger and his car. The rest of the movie was typical Hollywood actors making dumb decisions courtesy of writers who lead sheltered lives.(2.) Production: Dialogue had a low quality echoey sound. Background music was a loud, overbearing and aggravating. A cheap substitute to compensate for poor storyline. Cinematography and camera settings such as color palette looked washed out with a greenish tone.(3.) Self indulgent editing and directing. Two examples: A foot chase scene and later a fight scene each utilized between six and ten different camera angles while annoyingly constantly switching amongst the angles. Viewing from the bottom, top, sides all looked artificial and was a pointless distraction. Also nauseating.(4.) Acting was of the type where you sign up a few big names (they agree because they had nothing to do for a day and it's good money); the resulting  commitment to naturalism is to read lines like actors portraying actors.  Also looked non-commital and artificial.(5.) A rip off of the ""Girl with ..."" and ""Girl Who ..."" ""Kick-Ass"", ""Hanna"" movies with Carano in ""Haywire"" as Mallory Kane and was not at all convincing, especially in comparison to Rapace, Moretz, Ronan in their roles.

1529546,A3GLALCBHOR3T,B007C4ZJ0S,Harry Georgatos,"[6, 31]",This is Soderbegh in poor form. Soderbergh basically has taken a mainstream genre formula and given it an independent school of filmmaking. The hybrid of these two sensibilities don't gel that succesfully together. The shoot-outs are poorly staged and have no genuine intensity. Carano has no acting experience and it badly shows. She's convincing in the fight scenes and that's about it. Surrounded by high-class actors in this film helps overcome Carano's shortcomings with her stilted performance. Soderbergh likes using digital cameras to film his movies. I hate digital film as there's a flatness and coldness to the film. Some scenes have poor pictorial composition and it shows badly. There's just no intensity and genuine suspense in the chase through back-alleys and rooftops of Dublin. When one see's what Philip Noyce did for Angelina Jolie in SALT that's a director at the height of his game. HAYWIRE is extremly formulaic and routine. The extraction set-piece in Barcelona should have been bravado filmmaking but Soderbergh chooses to shoot the entire set-piece in silence and muted noise which would irritate mainstream audiences seeking huge thrills. The last 15 minutes of this film sinks even lower in mediocrity where it becomes nothing more then a below-par-cable movie. People looking for the female Jason Bourne will be disappointed with this film as the premise had great potential for something explosive with a more daring director.

1529547,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B007C4ZJ0S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 6]","So this was many months ago: Stunned in the aftermath of a brutal shellacking meted out by Chris Cyborg, MMA fighter Gina Carano entertained one of them standing at the crossroads moments. Which is around when Hollywood came knocking, when Steven Soderbergh decided to call and ask her to star in a movie. And here's HAYWIRE, fruit of their collaboration, a film that isn't high-brow or artsy or a Major Motion Picture. What it is, though, is gritty and action-packed and massively appealing. It just might make a movie star of Gina Carano. She's better looking than the Rock.From the opening scene in an upstate New York diner, your eyes are fixed on Carano. She sits at her table quietly, but there's a trapped animal watchfulness about her and you're instantly put on guard. And yet when the sitch goes sour, it happens in a shocking heartbeat and you're caught unprepared anyway (unless, of course, you've seen the trailer). Carano plays Mallory Kane, an exceptional employee in a private contracting company that takes on all manner of dirty ops work. The narrative doesn't follow a linear track. It shifts back and forth from the present and the past. As the film opens, Mallory Kane already has a bullseye on her.Mallory must work thru a labyrinthine puzzle to figure out all them what betrayed her. It all goes back to an eventful rescue mission executed by Mallory and her fellow agents in Barcelona - of which entirety we see in flashback. But all this is a superfluous info dump. It's the film's MacGuffin. Somewhere along the way, someone high up in the cloak & dagger community made the decision to sanction Mallory Kane. This then allows us to marvel at Carano as her resourceful, lethally capable character travels the globe bent on exacting revenge. From Barcelona to Dublin to New Mexico to upstate New York, she leaves a trail of busted up bodies.Even when Soderbergh is slumming, his stuff registers high on the watchability scale. HAYWIRE is his spin on the action thriller, and it's a well-crafted one. It's not just one fight after another. It takes its time in unfolding its narrative beats (okay, there are some slow spots). But HAYWIRE overall feels like the product of a master filmmaker letting his hair down and having fun but not neglecting his due diligence. It's obvious that Soderbergh set out to make Carano a star. HAYWIRE showcases her pretty brilliantly. Carano isn't half bad at the acting bits, and she is most definitely eye candy. But recognizing that she's a fledgling actress, Soderbergh populates her film with big Hollywood names. We're treated to hard-hitting scenes in which Carano opens a mean can on hunks like Channing Tatum, Michael Fassbender, and a slightly weasely Ewan Macgregor. The cool thing is these actors - along with Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas - seem to not mind playing second fiddle to a rookie actress. The performances are universally solid, with the biggest surprise being that Gina Carano does hold her own in their company. There's something about her, about her attitude, a sense that she's working hard but still not taking herself seriously. And when she smiles that flirty smile, there's a feel of wheels spinning internally. I believed that her character really was that intelligent and resourceful and undeterred. I already knew she was sexy.Soderbergh plonks her in diverse settings which showcase her versatility. We see her glamorous side as she partners Michael Fassbender's dashing MI6 operative on a work night in Dublin. We see her down and dirty as she gets to the business of eluding her assassins and dishing out payback. I didn't doubt that Gina Carano would be able to sell her action scenes; she's photogenic that way, too. Her fights are nasty affairs, no holds barred and sometimes not pretty to look at. Carano is explosive and marvelously athletic, and when she hits a body you don't doubt that her blows have a serious impact. And, to make it even more realistic, Carano also absorbs her share of punishment, lots of it. Soderbergh opted to not have a music score framing these no-quarter-given scraps. All you hear are the desperate grunts and harsh breathing and the thuds of striking feet and fists. It makes it even more believable.I heard someone mention this already, and, in fact, a cop in the film even refers to Carano by that name. But if the role of Wonder Woman is still being cast, why not Gina Carano? She's got the goods. And she probably won't even need that lasso of truth to whup on them villains. In any case, Gina Carano needs to do more films.",4,"""You shouldn't think of her as a woman.

But the heroine...God finally someone you can root for. Finally a girl you can relate to! We all loved Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but Angelina isn't credible people. A 90-pounder cannot in fact stick it to the bad guys the way this female MiddleWeight can. She's as thick as the guys she's supposedly whipping around, and dammit we believe her. For all of the awful factors of this pretty sorry film, watch it for the sturdy chick who takes some Muay Thai meanness to Michael Fassbender. Screw Channing Tatum and how heavy he lands on his crappy lines, watch Gina Carano throw her weight around like a champ. If you're a feminist, if you like dominant women, or if you just want to enjoy some slightly more believable martial arts--watch this film. Gina Carano can't act for much but she can kick. For those of you that have a desire to believe that women CAN in fact do bad-ass things, pop this in the DVD player and gaze into a piece of empowering imagery.That being said however...Every good part of this movie is spoiled in the preview. The film trailer is more impressive than the entirety of this sludge. The attempts to make the action realistic make it anticlimactic instead. This does not have the deliciously sharp edge of close-cut Krav Maga sequences like the Bourne Films. This does not have the choppy and brutal realism of Fight Club. The sounds are hollow; the moves are not so impressive. While the fight scenes are plausible I'd dare say they left Hollywood out of it--to their own detriment.

His work on the OCEAN's trilogy and TRAFFIC is proof of that. But then he'll go back and do films like FULL FRONTAL and THE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIMENT. After that, he'll return to Hollywood and do the big cast outbreak disaster film CONTAGION. But this film here, HAYWIRE, is kind of in-between his Hollywood and his indie sensibilities. And in Soderbergh's pursuit to do a film in every type of genre, he has taken it upon himself to make a spy actioner with former American Gladiator and MMA fighter Gina Carano as his muse and his lead amongst a cast that boasts Ewan MacGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Channing Tatum, Bill Paxton and Michael Fassbender.The plot is pretty rote: Mallory Kane (Carano) is former CIA-turned-independent-contractor. She has been double-crossed by her boss, Kenneth (MacGregor) and is on the run. She intends to return the favor in kind. Along the way, there are some pretty spectacular hand-to-hand fight sequences, some fun little chases and a plot twist or two. It's not the type of film you haven't seen before a hundred times, and there's the pity.Soderbergh and his occasional partner-in-crime screenwriter Lem Dobbs did a fantastic job subverting the crime drama a bit with THE LIMEY, and they could have used some of that same energy and smarts added to this film's interal workings. Instead, they decided to go with the same old, same old.Gina Carano is quite striking (in a number of ways) and is a talented actress. I hope that she's able to get more starring work, but I said the same thing about Zoe Bell from Tarantino's DEATH-PROOF and that hasn't happened yet. The rest of the ensemble don't really have a whole lot to do, but they all put themselves into it. Nothing feels particularly phoned in. MacGregor is a coward, Douglas is powerful, Tatum is conflicted, Fassbender is charming, Banderas is duplicitous, and Paxton is paternal. That's really all they needed for this film.The most important thing about HAYWIRE is that it's Soderbergh's chance to make a low-budget but globe-trotting actioner and also to bring someone like Carano into the cinema firmament, and it's fun and goofily serious, but it's nothing that will stay with you for a long time.",3,"A fun experiment for Soderbergh, but not much more.",1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,2465,"['Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'considered', 'indie', 'auteur', 'films', 'sex', 'videotape', 'KAFKA', 'THE', 'LIMEY', 'THE', 'UNDERNEATH', 'also', 'side-stepped', 'bright', 'lights', 'big', 'fun', 'studio', 'filmmaking', 'surprisingly', 'quite', 'good', 'work', 'OCEAN', 'trilogy', 'TRAFFIC', 'proof', 'then', ""'ll"", 'go', 'back', 'do', 'films', 'FULL', 'FRONTAL', 'THE', 'GIRLFRIEND', 'EXPERIMENT', ""'ll"", 'return', 'Hollywood', 'do', 'big', 'cast', 'outbreak', 'disaster', 'film', 'CONTAGION', 'film', 'here', 'HAYWIRE', 'kind', 'in-between', 'Hollywood', 'indie', 'sensibilities', 'Soderbergh', 'pursuit', 'do', 'film', 'type', 'genre', 'taken', 'make', 'spy', 'actioner', 'former', 'American', 'Gladiator', 'MMA', 'fighter', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'muse', 'lead', 'cast', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Michael', 'Fassbender.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'rote', 'Mallory', 'Kane', 'Carano', 'former', 'CIA-turned-independent-contractor', 'been', 'double-crossed', 'boss', 'Kenneth', 'MacGregor', 'run', 'return', 'favor', 'kind', 'way', 'are', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'hand-to-hand', 'fight', 'sequences', 'fun', 'little', 'chases', 'plot', 'twist', 'two', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'pity.Soderbergh', 'occasional', 'partner-in-crime', 'screenwriter', 'Lem', 'Dobbs', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'subverting', 'crime', 'drama', 'bit', 'THE', 'LIMEY', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'same', 'energy', 'smarts', 'added', 'film', 'interal', 'workings', 'Instead', 'decided', 'go', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old.Gina', 'Carano', 'quite', 'striking', 'number', 'ways', 'talented', 'actress', 'hope', 'able', 'get', 'more', 'starring', 'work', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'Tarantino', 'DEATH-PROOF', ""n't"", 'happened', 'yet', 'rest', 'ensemble', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'do', 'put', 'Nothing', 'particularly', 'phoned', 'MacGregor', 'coward', 'Douglas', 'powerful', 'Tatum', 'conflicted', 'Fassbender', 'charming', 'Banderas', 'duplicitous', 'Paxton', 'paternal', 'really', 'needed', 'film.The', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'HAYWIRE', 'Soderbergh', 'chance', 'make', 'low-budget', 'globe-trotting', 'actioner', 'also', 'bring', 'someone', 'Carano', 'cinema', 'firmament', 'fun', 'goofily', 'serious', 'nothing', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time']",N/A

It was her first film.  Carano plays an ex-Marine, now government assassin who turns rogue. Onscreen she's a cross between Linda Fiorentino (The Last Seduction) and Noomi Repace (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). As beautiful and raven haired as Fiorentino and as svelte and agile as Repace in black leather, Carano plays her role more like a Cyborg than a human. And she does her own stunts...great stuff.As Time film critic Richard Corliss writes in his review, this movie is ""sooo 1940's.""  Yes, it's an ""ingenious, old-school, thrill-a-minute"" entertaining movie needing no special effects, loud sound track, wild car chases nor hand-held cameras. And it's filmed mainly in Ireland...with one segment in a luxury suite in The Shelbourne Hotel for a little glam.Gina Carano may be new to film-goers...but there's an impressive array of male superstars.

But, to be fair, the movie did seem low-budget, the story-line was choppy, and some of the scenes were contrived.  The acting was good because the actors (Douglas, Banderas, Tatum, Fassbender, etc.) are good and the directing solid.  As some have stated, this was a vehicle to introduce Carano.  My take on that is, she's believable as an action acter like Cynthia Rothrock and Michelle Yeoh but with much more realistic (and affective) fighting.  She is fast, tough, and brutal (those are good things).  Her character did not require a broad range of acting skills (but look at Arnold, Stallone, Strathom, etc.) but what it did require, Carano delivered.  I hope she gets the chance to show us more.Would like to mention one other thing.  Hollywood seems to have conditioned audiences to want hystrionics in the dialog and reactions to events.

My biggest problem was that there was very little action and it certainly wasn't a thriller. In fact, this was the most passion-less thriller I have endured recently. There was a lot of talk, but even the talk was emotionless and ineffective; the plot was never very clear. Maybe when Amazon.com notifies me of the DVD release I can figure it out.The central issue seemed to be money, but there were so many double crosses and conflicting coalitions, I finally lost track.

(He mostly keeps his clothes on in this one...smile...)* Ewan McGregor (""Beginners"") seems to be in charge of the professional agents, but his motives aren't totally clear.* Antonio Banderas (""Puss in Boots"") is the mouthpiece for the kingpin in Barcelona...we think...* Michael Angarano (""Red State"") is the hapless guy in the diner whose car is commandeered and him along with it. He goes from cautious to helpful to terrified in just three scenes.* Michael Douglas (""Solitary Man"") is a government official who seems to be playing both ends against the middle.I guess Soderbergh doesn't have to hit a home run every time at bat.

She is attractive and plays a leading role as a tough girl. When Angelina Jolie did it she was acting. Gina Carano can most likely really kick your ass. It was nice to see her play the kind of role usually held by guys and it really made her more attractive as the movie played out.- There are quite a few well known actors in the movie, which was a little surprising.- Gina's fight scenes. You could tell she knows what she is doing so her part of the fighting was more realistic.- I personally didn't think Gina's acting was bad. Some people have a problem with it, but she did decent considering shes a MMA fighter and not an actor.The Bad- The fight scenes. Outside of Gina herself the fights were a mixed bag. It was occasionally kind of obvious it was fake because the person she was fighting cant operate at her level, like the fight with Ewan Mcgregor, though the fights with Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender were decent. For a movie billed as an action movie there also was not that much action which was disappointing.- The overall story was kind of dull. It really sort of left me saying is this it? The viewers were not really given a reason to care.- The ending. I really didn't like it. It felt like the last 15 minutes of the movie that should have been there were suddenly cut off.Overall this is an average movie, and there are both good and bad areas to it. If you go into the movie just looking for a popcorn flick and some action then you will most likely be satisfied.

1529564,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B007C4ZJ0S,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[0, 0]","Traditionally, January is the time that most film studios tend to dump the films that they know aren't very good but that they're hoping they can still make some money off of before releasing them on DVD.  As such, I tend to approach films differently in January than I do most months of the year.  I go in with lowered expectations and yet, often times, I'm still surprised by how disappointing most of the films in January truly are.  However, this year, I'm surprised and happy to say that a genuinely entertaining film has actually been released in January and that film is Steven Soderbergh's Haywire.In Haywire, Mixed Martial Artist Gina Carano plays Mallory Kane, an ex-Marine who is now working as a covert operative for a security firm owned by her ex-boyfriend (Ewan McGregor).  After rescuing a hostage in Barcelona, Mallory is immediately sent on another assignment to Dublin.  However, once she gets to Dublin and meets up with another enigmatic operative (Michael Fassbender), she quickly discovers that she's been set up and somebody wants her dead.  The rest of the film deals with her efforts to discover who has set her up and why and then getting her own brand of violent revenge on her enemies.At this point, Steven Soderbergh could pretty much make this type of film in his sleep and, to a certain extent, Haywire feels a lot like Soderbergh on autopilot.  Fortunately, Soderbergh on autopilot is still usually more interesting than most other American directors working today.  He's using his usual tricks here (frequent flashbacks, a jazzy score, and an emphasis on style over substance) but he uses them well and the end result is an entertaining and fast-paced 90 minute film.  Gina Carano, to be honest, isn't much of an actress but she's a great fighter and the scenes where she's literally fighting for her life are all the more exciting because her amazing moves are not the result of CGI but her own natural abilities.  Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, and Bill Paxton are all well-cast and Antonio Banderas has a lot of fun with his cameo appearance.  The final result is a genuinely entertaining film that's considerably better than the usual January cinematic product.",3,Entertaining Enough For January,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,2203,"['Traditionally', 'January', 'time', 'most', 'film', 'studios', 'tend', 'dump', 'films', 'know', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'money', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'such', 'tend', 'approach', 'films', 'differently', 'January', 'do', 'most', 'months', 'year', 'go', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'yet', 'often', ""'m"", 'still', 'surprised', 'how', 'disappointing', 'most', 'films', 'January', 'truly', 'are', 'However', 'year', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'happy', 'say', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'actually', 'been', 'released', 'January', 'film', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Haywire.In', 'Haywire', 'Mixed', 'Martial', 'Artist', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'Mallory', 'Kane', 'ex-Marine', 'who', 'now', 'working', 'covert', 'operative', 'security', 'firm', 'owned', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'rescuing', 'hostage', 'Barcelona', 'Mallory', 'immediately', 'sent', 'assignment', 'Dublin', 'However', 'once', 'Dublin', 'up', 'enigmatic', 'operative', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'quickly', 'discovers', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'somebody', 'dead', 'rest', 'film', 'deals', 'efforts', 'discover', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'why', 'then', 'getting', 'own', 'brand', 'violent', 'revenge', 'enemies.At', 'point', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'make', 'type', 'film', 'sleep', 'certain', 'extent', 'Haywire', 'lot', 'Soderbergh', 'autopilot', 'Fortunately', 'Soderbergh', 'autopilot', 'still', 'usually', 'more', 'interesting', 'most', 'other', 'American', 'directors', 'working', 'today', 'using', 'usual', 'tricks', 'here', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'jazzy', 'score', 'emphasis', 'style', 'substance', 'well', 'end', 'result', 'entertaining', 'fast-paced', '90', 'minute', 'film', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'be', 'honest', ""n't"", 'much', 'actress', 'great', 'fighter', 'scenes', 'where', 'literally', 'fighting', 'life', 'are', 'more', 'exciting', 'amazing', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'result', 'CGI', 'own', 'natural', 'abilities', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'are', 'well-cast', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'lot', 'fun', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'final', 'result', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'considerably', 'better', 'usual', 'January', 'cinematic', 'product']",N/A

Peters,"[12, 25]","I had seen the trailer for this movie and thought it looked rather compelling, so I was eager to rent it when it became available in the local Red Box rental machine.  Before I had actually watched it, my daughter saw the DVD and mentioned that she had seen the movie in the theater and that it was disappointing.  I told her about the trailer, and she said it contained the best two minutes of the entire movie.  It turns out her assessment was entirely accurate.I had a sneaking suspicion that the movie was going to be a total dud after viewing it for only about five minutes.  The longer I watched it, the more my suspicion was confirmed.  This movie is the kind you keep watching because you hope it's going to pick up its pace, but that never happened. I finally just shut the movie off after about 50 minutes.  Even though there were only about 40 minutes remaining, and even though I could have invested the remaining time to at least see how things ended, I just didn't care anymore. It was really that bad.To give you an idea of the movie's content, the movie opens with a scene in a diner where Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) and Aaron (Channing Tatum) end up fighting. Aaron is totally pummeling the hell out of Mallory, but in a manner taken straight out of the old Channel 47 wrestling matches of the 1970s, even though Mallory should have been knocked out (or killed) several times, there is a miraculous reversal in the action, and she ends up dominating Aaron and subduing him.  What then follows are 40 minutes of slow-moving scenes, pointless filler, flash-backs that seem like they might be from a different movie or storyline, bland dialogue, and a totally awful soundtrack.  There is eventually another fight scene between Mallory and Paul (Michael Fassbender), and it's the same I-almost-kill-you-but-you-miraculously-manage-to-turn-the-tables kind of fight.  It was just ridiculous, and it utterly strained credulity.Even though there are some big names in this movie, it just isn't worth your time, and it certainly isn't worth your money.  If you feel compelled to see it, do yourself a favor and rent it first to see what I mean. I am usually pretty forgiving when watching movies, and I am willing to forgo things like character development and plot for good special effects and action, but this movie cannot claim credit for any of these things.

""Haywire"" has director Steven Soderbergh (""Traffic"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"") at the helm who brings his talents to an otherwise typical story of a black-ops agent named Mallory (Gina Carano, Former MMA Star) who rescues a hostage and is given a job that leads to her being (gasp) betrayed by someone close to her.So naturally she must fight back and use her training and skills to find out who betrayed her and well take them out for lack of a better word. Since this is her first major film role, its good that Soderbergh put together an all-star supporting cast with her. Among them are Ewan McGregor (The new ""Star Wars"" Trilogy), Antonio Banderas (""The Mask of Zorro"" and ""Shrek 2""), Bill Paxton (""Twister"" & ""Frailty""), Michael Douglas (""Basic Instinct"" & ""The Sentinel"") and others really add some pep to this flick.The music by David Holmes also really fits the movie, its stylish and really soothing and also jolting when it has to be but it doesn't overpower the movie. The story while simple is well done thanks to the layered cast, the previously mentioned music, Soderbergh's direction and to me Carano shines here as she's not given way too much to do but looks equal parts tough and very, very beautiful.

1529589,AX9C10JD538D9,B007C4ZJ0S,Liviania,"[1, 3]","Steven Soderbergh doesn't always make critically acclaimed movies; yet, he remains a critical darling.  I think it's because he takes chances with his films.  He's willing to try his hand at new genres and to push at the boundaries of those genres.Haywire, at its core, is a straightforward revenge-driven action thriller.  Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) did a job in Barcelona.  Shortly after, she finds herself betrayed by her agency and pursued by assassins.  But the movie begins after that, with Mallory's first contact post-betrayal with former coworker Aaron (Channing Tatum).  The Barcelona and Dublin jobs fold out in flashbacks.There are moments when Haywire shines.  The script is lean, allowing the images to carry the story.  Most of the action unfolds wordlessly to a jazzy electronic score by David Holmes.  At Haywire's release, critics made a big to do over a female action star who looked like she could actually carry out the action.  Now, Carano did her time as an MMA fighter.  She's got muscle, and it shows, especially in the rare scene where her bare arms make an appearance.  But she's not particularly Amazonian.  Her muscle is more toned than bulky.  But Carano carries the physicality of the movie wonderfully.  She can do her own stunts and the choreography is quite wonderful.Carano's acting is not up to par with her stuntwork.  She does good at playing cold, which is necessary for most of the film, but she's less convincing when having a touching moment with her father.  The role of Mallory suits Carano well, and she might certainly have a future as an action star.  Most of the acting is carried off by the very able supporting cast, which includes Michael Fassbender and Michael Douglas.  I adore Ewan McGregor, but his Kenneth didn't always work for me.  (It may be because I associate blond Ewan McGregor withI Love You Phillip Morrisand thus think blond Ewan McGregor is the sweetest thing ever.)As much as I loved the flashbacks, the framing was somewhat awkward.  Mallory explains her story to a preternaturally calm kid.  I'm not blaming the actor.  It was a strange part, and it's for the best that the end of Haywire forgets that he ever existed.If you like action movies or any of the actors involved, I'd buy or rent Haywire.  It delivers heavily on stylish, brutal, and realistic action.  The story isn't ridiculously stupid and the long interlude with Mallory and Paul (Fassbender) is delightfully tense.

The latter three all starring George Clooney.So, when he saw MMA fighter Gina Carrano fight he had the idea to build a movie around her character, and Haywire is the result. His fascination with her is understandable, and he takes an appreciable risk casting an unknown and inexperienced actress in a leading role.The risk I think does pay off. While she may lack the smooth acting technique of a more established actress, she more than compensates for this with her charisma and presence, her impeccable fighter skills, and fascinating physicality.When an operation goes wrong members of a shady organisation, intent on cleaning up pursue her with the intent to kill. It's nothing personal just business.I loved for example that she traveled to Ireland on a mission, and part of the pursuit takes place through Dublin City. The odds against her seem insurmountable, and she has to push to get even before she gets squared away.Because of her fighting skills the fight scenes have a gripping realism, and usually she is fighting men who are also very skilled, and whether she will win is by no means certain. In one fight she is attacked by surprise from behind.I have to admit I did enjoy this movie a lot more than I expected. It's a refreshing change from the formula where the fight scenes are obviously choreographed, and you get MTV style cross cutting and slow motion where the heroines hair doesn't get mussed.You can watch many clips of Gina Carrano on youtube, and decide for yourself if you are intrigued and I totally enjoyed the movie.

Yahoo!I was somewhat familiar with Gina Carano prior to her film debut and it was already well known she had that unusual combination of being seriously hot in addition to being a serious badass. But this - this is something altogether new. Something amazing.What anorexic Angelina was attempting to capture in her film 'Salt' - Gina actually accomplished in 'Haywire'; profiling the life of a genuine female spec operator. No wires, no cinematic camera tricks, no politically correct faux-empowerment b.s. This is sheer power and a lifetime of martial arts training packaged into a stunning shell of female beauty. A full-on bleeping medieval babe. Hot damn! :-DI can remember when Cynthia Rothrock was the kickass-chick-du-jour of her time and she did an okay job of carrying the titular role of ""Baddest Babe On The Planet"". But Gina, whooboy, she's taken that to a completely new level!In this fun action-packed film, Gina plays former Marine and current independent contractor Molly Kane. A hardcore and disciplined warrior whose services are in demand for the same reason that real-life female operators are sought out - that very rare combination of brains, skills and sexuality. Her current assignment: Rescue a kidnapping victim.But is the job what it appears?A well-trod action/adventure made completely fresh by Ms. Carano and her exquisite confluence of bone crushing devastation and sensual lethality. Her wicked beauty and monster skills really drive this well beyond your typical action flick.Altogether fantastic and highly enjoyable - one that I have already purchased for repeat screenings.My fear is that she might have started in films too late. Not sure how long her looks can last in comparison to the types of roles she might take on. But I'm not betting against her.I'm also hoping that Soderbergh considers doing a trilogy - making up to us for his mishandling of the Ocean's trilogy. Would pay big bucks to see another Molly ""Hatchet"" Kane film.The only complaint I have is very minor. In the scene when Coblenz, played by Michael Douglas, meets Molly for the first time, he's accompanied by bodyguards that would better suited protecting some silly reality tv starlet. The lack of professionalism shown - they're standing by with their hands in their pockets - is disturbing to say the least and sincerely dangerous at the worst. It's a small mistake by Soderbergh, but one that irked considering how much effort he places toward accuracy in his films.",5,Now We Know Who They Should Have Cast In 'Salt',1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,2492,"['Holy', 'Smokes', 'Yahoo', 'was', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'prior', 'film', 'debut', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'known', 'had', 'unusual', 'combination', 'being', 'seriously', 'hot', 'addition', 'being', 'serious', 'badass', 'something', 'altogether', 'new', 'Something', 'amazing.What', 'anorexic', 'Angelina', 'was', 'attempting', 'capture', 'film', ""'Salt"", 'Gina', 'actually', 'accomplished', ""'Haywire"", 'profiling', 'life', 'genuine', 'female', 'spec', 'operator', 'wires', 'cinematic', 'camera', 'tricks', 'politically', 'correct', 'faux-empowerment', 'b.s', 'sheer', 'power', 'lifetime', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'packaged', 'stunning', 'shell', 'female', 'beauty', 'full-on', 'bleeping', 'medieval', 'babe', 'Hot', 'damn', '-DI', 'can', 'remember', 'when', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'was', 'kickass-chick-du-jour', 'time', 'did', 'okay', 'job', 'carrying', 'titular', 'role', 'Baddest', 'Babe', 'Planet', 'Gina', 'whooboy', 'taken', 'completely', 'new', 'level', 'fun', 'action-packed', 'film', 'Gina', 'former', 'Marine', 'current', 'independent', 'contractor', 'Molly', 'Kane', 'A', 'hardcore', 'disciplined', 'warrior', 'services', 'are', 'demand', 'same', 'reason', 'real-life', 'female', 'operators', 'are', 'sought', 'out', 'very', 'rare', 'combination', 'brains', 'skills', 'sexuality', 'current', 'assignment', 'Rescue', 'kidnapping', 'victim.But', 'job', 'what', 'well-trod', 'action/adventure', 'made', 'completely', 'fresh', 'Ms.', 'Carano', 'exquisite', 'confluence', 'bone', 'crushing', 'devastation', 'sensual', 'lethality', 'wicked', 'beauty', 'monster', 'skills', 'really', 'drive', 'well', 'typical', 'action', 'flick.Altogether', 'fantastic', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'have', 'already', 'purchased', 'repeat', 'screenings.My', 'fear', 'might', 'have', 'started', 'films', 'too', 'late', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'long', 'looks', 'can', 'last', 'comparison', 'types', 'roles', 'might', 'take', ""'m"", 'not', 'betting', 'her.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'hoping', 'Soderbergh', 'considers', 'doing', 'trilogy', 'making', 'up', 'mishandling', 'Ocean', 'trilogy', 'Would', 'pay', 'big', 'bucks', 'see', 'Molly', 'Hatchet', 'Kane', 'film.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'very', 'minor', 'scene', 'when', 'Coblenz', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Molly', 'first', 'time', 'accompanied', 'bodyguards', 'would', 'better', 'suited', 'protecting', 'silly', 'reality', 'tv', 'starlet', 'lack', 'professionalism', 'shown', ""'re"", 'standing', 'hands', 'pockets', 'disturbing', 'say', 'least', 'sincerely', 'dangerous', 'worst', 'small', 'mistake', 'Soderbergh', 'one', 'irked', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'accuracy', 'films']",N/A

1529599,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B007C4ZJ0S,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[6, 15]","I like how Soderbergh will alternate between making big-budget popcorn flicks with low-budget experiments. It's nice to see a director trying to expand beyond his usual oeuvre, although that also means there's bound to be more than a few misfires. In fact, the last off-beat Soderbergh I saw that I liked was BUBBLE. The rest have been, well, good for him for trying is the point.Don't let the big names in HAYWIRE fool you. Everyone here -- Michael Douglas, Ewan MacGregor, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton -- these people are the A-list powder sugar dusting on what is essentially Soderbergh filming Gina Carano beating people up for an hour and a half. If you don't know who Carano is, neither do I, and I didn't like this movie enough to look her up. I have heard that she was some kind of martial arts wunderkind, which is evident in the film. The fight choreography is a lot of fun without being cartoonish. There's also quite a bit of it.When Carano isn't fighting, she's trying very hard to convey emotions with what I have decided are paralytic good looks. I cannot tell if she chose to sublimate every one of her character's feelings under the same cold facade (if so, lazy and boring choice) or if she -- being new to film -- was afraid to look anything but her best in the movie, and so she always has the exact same sexy half-smirk in every scene. It's like the girl you know who does the duckface in every photo because she thinks its the only way she can take a good photo. Of course, maybe Carano just doesn't really know how to act, and the look on her face is muted confusion.The story might be partly to blame for that. Characters toss out vague references to being spies and such, and there's dozens of references to foreign places as if they were events. ""Did he tell you about Barcelona? I'll never forget Dublin! Don't tell me you were behind Madrid!"" The meat and potatoes of the plot work in the same overly general way. It's hard to understand much of what's going on, and when all is made (somewhat) clear, it turns out to be your basic spy-by-numbers plot. Even more disappointing than that is that the final revelations are made in true, clunky, B-movie style by having one character explain everything in a drawn-out monologue.The weirdest example of this happens near the very beginning, when Carano steals a man's car, but then politely tells him all about her jaded history as a private spy before crashing the car into Act Two. It's never fully explained why she sweetly reveals everything to this total stranger -- maybe he was supposed to go to the cops with his second-hand info from a wanted criminal? -- and when the topic is brushed over, it's dismissed without fanfare. Because who cares, right? Character actions and motivations be dammed! What people really want is Carano beating the snot out of Michael Fassbender for ten minutes.Well, I didn't want that. Soderbergh apparently did. If you do, too, then you might enjoy this film.

1529601,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007C4ZJ0S,Mark Turner,"[2, 5]","It seems that we've never had a female version of the James Bond character. Certainly Bond has had his share of femme fatales but never has one taken the lead role in a film. The closest we've had in the past was Cynthia Rothrock who starred in a series of martial arts films, but those were always B movie quality. That all changes with HAYWIRE.MMA star Gina Carano starts as Mallory Kane, an operative for a private group that hires out to the likes of the CIA. An ex-Marine, Mallory is more tomboy than girly girl. As the film opens she makes her way to a diner where she meets up with Aaron (Channing Tatum), a fellow operative sent to bring her in. When she refuses the first of many well choreographed fight sequences begins. Mallory escapes and is on the run with a young man from the diner in tow. As they speed off she begins to tell him her tale.It all went sour with a job in Barcelona. Mallory's boss Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) has sent her out at the request of Coblenz (Michael Douglas), the head of a secret government agency one would assume is the CIA, and fellow spymaster Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas). It should be a simple snatch and grab, rescuing a hostage and taking him home. When one of the guards for the hostage takes off, Mallory chases him down resulting in another well choreographed fight sequence.Home after the run Mallory finds Kenneth waiting for her and asking her to do one more job before some well earned time off. This time the job takes her to Ireland where she is to meet up with a member of MI-6 named Paul (Michael Fassbender). At a party hosted by some big wig, Mallory wanders around and discovers the hostage from the Barcelona affair with a bullet in his head. Something seems wrong which becomes painfully obvious when Paul tries to kill Mallory when they return to their hotel room. He doesn't succeed.Traveling home with the intent of revenge, Mallory has ended where we found her at the beginning of the film. Just who she can and can not trust is in question. The only person she does is her father, an ex-military man himself (played by Bill Paxton). When a hit squad with Kenneth shows there the chances of their survival are slim even though they exude confidence. How the film finishes, just who was it that was behind all the skullduggery and who will pay make for a fine film.Directed by Steven Soderbergh this is not his usual style of film. This outing into the world of action adventure shows he is quite capable. While not quite up to par with the Bourne films, the movie does take its action sequences seriously and shoots them in the way they should be shot, with the camera back a way so we can actually watch the fight scenes rather than in the middle looking for close ups.The story is well written and thought out though it takes a while to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps more clues along the way would have upped the ante here, but as it is the movie still tells a compelling story.The movie seems made for Carano, forming around her and her incredible fighting skills, showing them off as best as they can. One would think that her acting ability would be lacking but she demonstrates an ability to do better than most real life action stars pushed into the world of film. Her character does offer a rather stoic look more often than not, but for a first feature role she does outstanding. Future films will tell if she can get the acting chops she needs or not.For an action film the action must be non-stop and well thought out. It must be paced at regular intervals and those scenes must work well within the story. That is done here in spades. It also must feature someone who can handle the action as well as co-stars who can do the same. That's also well done here, including having Fassbender do his own stunts in the fight sequence he performs with Carano. It all results in a fast paced, well made action film that's worth your rental fee.",3,BOND WITHOUT TESTOSTERONE,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3920,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'female', 'version', 'James', 'Bond', 'character', 'Certainly', 'Bond', 'had', 'share', 'femme', 'fatales', 'never', 'one', 'taken', 'lead', 'role', 'film', 'closest', ""'ve"", 'had', 'past', 'was', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'who', 'starred', 'series', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'were', 'always', 'B', 'movie', 'quality', 'changes', 'HAYWIRE.MMA', 'star', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'Mallory', 'Kane', 'operative', 'private', 'group', 'out', 'likes', 'CIA', 'ex-Marine', 'Mallory', 'more', 'tomboy', 'girly', 'girl', 'film', 'way', 'diner', 'where', 'up', 'Aaron', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'fellow', 'operative', 'sent', 'bring', 'When', 'first', 'many', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'sequences', 'Mallory', 'escapes', 'run', 'young', 'man', 'diner', 'tow', 'speed', 'off', 'tell', 'tale.It', 'went', 'sour', 'job', 'Barcelona', 'Mallory', 'boss', 'Kenneth', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'sent', 'out', 'request', 'Coblenz', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'head', 'secret', 'government', 'agency', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'CIA', 'fellow', 'spymaster', 'Rodrigo', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'should', 'be', 'simple', 'snatch', 'grab', 'rescuing', 'hostage', 'taking', 'home', 'When', 'one', 'guards', 'hostage', 'off', 'Mallory', 'down', 'resulting', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'sequence.Home', 'run', 'Mallory', 'Kenneth', 'waiting', 'asking', 'do', 'one', 'more', 'job', 'well', 'earned', 'time', 'off', 'time', 'job', 'Ireland', 'where', 'meet', 'up', 'member', 'MI-6', 'named', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'party', 'hosted', 'big', 'wig', 'Mallory', 'wanders', 'hostage', 'Barcelona', 'affair', 'bullet', 'head', 'Something', 'wrong', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'when', 'Paul', 'kill', 'Mallory', 'when', 'return', 'hotel', 'room', ""n't"", 'succeed.Traveling', 'home', 'intent', 'revenge', 'Mallory', 'ended', 'where', 'found', 'beginning', 'film', 'Just', 'who', 'can', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'question', 'only', 'person', 'father', 'ex-military', 'man', 'played', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'When', 'hit', 'squad', 'Kenneth', 'shows', 'there', 'chances', 'survival', 'are', 'slim', 'even', 'exude', 'confidence', 'How', 'film', 'finishes', 'just', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'skullduggery', 'who', 'will', 'pay', 'make', 'fine', 'film.Directed', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'not', 'usual', 'style', 'film', 'outing', 'world', 'action', 'adventure', 'quite', 'capable', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'Bourne', 'films', 'movie', 'take', 'action', 'sequences', 'seriously', 'shoots', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'shot', 'camera', 'back', 'way', 'can', 'actually', 'watch', 'fight', 'rather', 'middle', 'looking', 'close', 'ups.The', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'thought', 'out', 'while', 'get', 'bottom', 'things', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'clues', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'upped', 'ante', 'here', 'movie', 'still', 'compelling', 'story.The', 'movie', 'made', 'Carano', 'forming', 'incredible', 'fighting', 'skills', 'showing', 'off', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'acting', 'ability', 'would', 'be', 'lacking', 'ability', 'do', 'better', 'most', 'real', 'life', 'action', 'stars', 'pushed', 'world', 'film', 'character', 'offer', 'rather', 'stoic', 'look', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'first', 'feature', 'role', 'outstanding', 'Future', 'films', 'will', 'tell', 'can', 'get', 'acting', 'not.For', 'action', 'film', 'action', 'must', 'be', 'non-stop', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'must', 'be', 'paced', 'regular', 'intervals', 'scenes', 'must', 'work', 'well', 'story', 'done', 'here', 'spades', 'also', 'must', 'feature', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'co-stars', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'here', 'including', 'having', 'Fassbender', 'do', 'own', 'stunts', 'fight', 'sequence', 'Carano', 'results', 'fast', 'paced', 'well', 'made', 'action', 'film', 'rental', 'fee']",N/A

1529606,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B007C4ZJ0S,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[17, 18]","The action hero genre has long resisted a strong female lead. Although Angelina Jolie is the current reigning queen, her sexiness is as much a driving force as her martial prowess. Steven Soderbergh clearly thought he could do better with Gina Carano, a real life mixed martial arts champion. Is she up to the challenge?Yes and no. One the one hand, Soderbergh has created a character that's not very hard for her to play. Mallory Kane (Carano) is a Jason Bourne-style cipher, with a ruthless reputation. When she is tapped for a mission as a government contractor, there are layers upon layers of intrigue that swirl around her, with Kane as the most valuable piece in the game. That doesn't really ever reflect on Carano's face though, which seems to be frozen in a bemused smirk.The story is told in media res as she meets a man in a diner who isn't who she hoped. Soderbergh carefully stages each one of her fight scenes, and it's fascinating to see Carano in action. She literally crawls up her opponents, using a woman's physical advantages - powerful legs - to counterbalance opponents who are out of her weight class. After fleeing the scene with the assistance of an innocent bystander, she tells him -- and the audience - her tale.And it's a doozy. A Chinese dissident/professor/journalist has been kidnapped and it's up to Carano's team to get him back. Or is it? Is she working for the good guys or the bad guys? This being a Soderbergh film, it's likely there are no good guys here.Soderbergh has fun with his, casting Carano in a variety of scenes where she brutally beats men to death. See Kane kill a man in a diner...in a cocktail dress...and on a beautiful beach as the sun sets!Carano plays Kane as uncomfortable in social settings. ""I don't do the dress thing"" she quips. But she has to, because that's a staple of the modern spy genre and Carano is beautiful enough to pull it off. The scene of course ends with more bare-knuckled brawling in an evening dress, which unfortunately still feeds into the observer effect common to these kinds of films.Still, Carano lends a toughness and believability to a character archetype that has long been fetishized. You can see it in her combat style, in her eyes, and most importantly in her hands. Her paws are big and meaty, not the dainty fingers of an actress who lives a life of luxury off set. Kane looks like she can punch you in the face, and that's exactly how it should be.""Haywire"" tries to be deeper than it is while shoring up its lead's lack of acting talent with a character who's just as bland as she is. That doesn't change the fact that this is still a step forward for the female action hero. Carano may not be all that eloquent, but neither is Schwarzenegger or Stallone.",3,Hit-Girl all grown up,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,2752,"['action', 'hero', 'genre', 'long', 'resisted', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'current', 'reigning', 'queen', 'sexiness', 'as', 'much', 'driving', 'force', 'martial', 'prowess', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'clearly', 'thought', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'real', 'life', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'champion', 'challenge', 'Yes', 'One', 'one', 'hand', 'Soderbergh', 'created', 'character', 'not', 'very', 'hard', 'play', 'Mallory', 'Kane', 'Carano', 'Jason', 'Bourne-style', 'cipher', 'ruthless', 'reputation', 'When', 'tapped', 'mission', 'government', 'contractor', 'are', 'layers', 'layers', 'intrigue', 'swirl', 'Kane', 'most', 'valuable', 'piece', 'game', ""n't"", 'really', 'ever', 'reflect', 'Carano', 'face', 'be', 'frozen', 'bemused', 'smirk.The', 'story', 'told', 'media', 'res', 'man', 'diner', 'who', ""n't"", 'who', 'hoped', 'Soderbergh', 'carefully', 'one', 'fight', 'scenes', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Carano', 'action', 'literally', 'up', 'opponents', 'using', 'woman', 'physical', 'advantages', 'powerful', 'legs', 'counterbalance', 'opponents', 'who', 'are', 'weight', 'class', 'fleeing', 'scene', 'assistance', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'audience', 'tale.And', 'doozy', 'Chinese', 'dissident/professor/journalist', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'up', 'Carano', 'team', 'get', 'back', 'working', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'being', 'Soderbergh', 'film', 'likely', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'here.Soderbergh', 'fun', 'casting', 'Carano', 'variety', 'scenes', 'where', 'brutally', 'men', 'death', 'See', 'Kane', 'kill', 'man', 'diner', 'cocktail', 'dress', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'sun', 'Carano', 'Kane', 'uncomfortable', 'social', 'settings', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'dress', 'thing', 'staple', 'modern', 'spy', 'genre', 'Carano', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'scene', 'course', 'more', 'bare-knuckled', 'brawling', 'evening', 'dress', 'unfortunately', 'still', 'observer', 'effect', 'common', 'kinds', 'films.Still', 'Carano', 'toughness', 'believability', 'character', 'archetype', 'long', 'been', 'fetishized', 'can', 'see', 'combat', 'style', 'eyes', 'most', 'importantly', 'hands', 'paws', 'are', 'big', 'meaty', 'not', 'dainty', 'fingers', 'actress', 'who', 'life', 'luxury', 'set', 'Kane', 'can', 'punch', 'face', 'exactly', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'Haywire', 'be', 'deeper', 'shoring', 'up', 'lead', 'lack', 'acting', 'talent', 'character', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'bland', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'still', 'step', 'forward', 'female', 'action', 'hero', 'Carano', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'eloquent', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Stallone']",N/A

From Bruce Lee classics to Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and beyond, I have seen and loved many a fight scene. My recent favorites have been Ong Bak, Unleashed, and The Raid.

They also feature high flying styles of fighting. This film has several fight scenes that showcase Carano's MMA skills. Mixed Martial Arts is the most practical style of fighting around. It combines jui-jitsu with wrestling an other stlyles. What it ends up looking like on screen is a really well choregraphed and skill-ful brawl. No backflips and spinning roundhouses here. Just realistic, grounded, and brutal violence.The movie itself is not too bad. Carano's acting is a bit choppy, though its her first film.

1529611,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B007C4ZJ0S,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[7, 10]","With Cynthia Rothrock considered yesterday's news and the film world over-enamored with Milla Jovovich in her over-produced blockbusters, it really surprises me that a movie like ""Haywire"" could still be made under the Hollywood umbrella. Not only is an action movie starring a woman getting the big-name treatment, but it's an action movie starring a genuine fighter and not some stunt-doubled starlet. While most of the professional cage brawlers who've made it to the film world have had to slug it out in some remarkably bad low-budget fare (e.g.Never Surrender), MMA heroine Gina Carano lucks out with a great director and a surprisingly good cast in a pretty satisfying CIA revenge flick that could easily become the foundation of a very promising career.The story: black ops operative Mallory Kane (Carano, who had a bit part inBlood & Bone) embarks on an intercontinental mission to find out why she was betrayed by her allies...I can easily see why the general, non- action-oriented public might not like this movie. Director Steven Soderbergh is definitely one of contemporary Hollywood's best, and because this isn'tTraffic, people who aren't in it for the punches and kicks might consider it a step down for him. Additionally, even I was surprised by this one's cast: I would have expected to find Channing Tatum (Fighting), but Antonio Banderas (Desperado), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting), and Michael friggin' Douglas (Wall Street)? It's as though Steven Soderbergh called in some favors and bets he won... Truthfully, some of these big names aren't necessary to the film - Michael Douglas' role as a CIA director could've easily been played by someone else - so again, some viewers who will watch this film for name recognition are chancing disappointment when these big stars end up not doing too much. With that said, everybody generally does well and you have to hand it to star Gina Carano for making the most of her first major role: even when not kicking butt, her dramatic offering is more than acceptable.Of course, the main reason I saw the film was for the butt-kicking, and I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. Mixed martial arts movies contradict my belief that the best fight scenes are produced by low-budget fare where choreographical creativity can be embellished and not stifled by the whims of producers: while the majority of direct-to-video MMA movies have featured truly awful fight scenes, Hollywood seems to have a better bead on how to make the most of ""realistic"" fighting, and ""Haywire"" is a great example. Carano has six fights of varying lengths throughout the film, and to say that she uses them to redefine how powerful a woman can appear onscreen is an understatement. Even though I like only four of these brawls (which include a standup battle against Ewan McGregor of all people), they're good enough to make me reconsider the place of mixed martial arts in movies. The fights are, for the most part, well-shot and Carano displays the same sort of brutal efficiency as in her Strikeforce career, though she's not above the occasional flashy move like a rebounding roundhouse off the wall. When it comes to looking like she really means it but still being entertaining, Gina's got few equals.The production is strong, which should be a given in a Soderbergh movie. Some of the European scenes are shot on location, others are fudged, but it all looks authentic. The film doesn't try to do anything aesthetically new, but as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't need to: unless you're particularly needy of car chases and explosions, this movie delivers what an action picture should and does it with a complete lack of pretense. My only major qualm? - the ending comes from out of nowhere and bit too soon for my taste, but I can live with this. Definitely worth a watch, and probably even a buy.",4,"""I've never done a woman before...""",1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,3849,"['Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'considered', 'yesterday', 'news', 'film', 'world', 'over-enamored', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'over-produced', 'blockbusters', 'really', 'movie', 'Haywire', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'umbrella', 'Not', 'only', 'action', 'movie', 'starring', 'woman', 'getting', 'big-name', 'treatment', 'action', 'movie', 'starring', 'genuine', 'fighter', 'not', 'stunt-doubled', 'starlet', 'most', 'professional', 'cage', 'brawlers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'made', 'film', 'world', 'have', 'had', 'slug', 'out', 'remarkably', 'bad', 'low-budget', 'fare', 'Surrender', 'MMA', 'heroine', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'out', 'great', 'director', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'cast', 'pretty', 'satisfying', 'CIA', 'revenge', 'flick', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'foundation', 'very', 'promising', 'career.The', 'story', 'black', 'ops', 'operative', 'Mallory', 'Kane', 'Carano', 'who', 'had', 'bit', 'part', 'inBlood', 'Bone', 'intercontinental', 'mission', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'betrayed', 'allies', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'general', 'non-', 'action-oriented', 'public', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'Director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'definitely', 'one', 'contemporary', 'Hollywood', 'best', ""isn'tTraffic"", 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'punches', 'kicks', 'might', 'consider', 'step', 'down', 'Additionally', 'even', 'was', 'surprised', 'one', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'find', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Fighting', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Desperado', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Trainspotting', 'Michael', 'friggin', 'Douglas', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'called', 'favors', 'bets', 'won', 'Truthfully', 'big', 'names', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'film', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'role', 'CIA', 'director', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', 'played', 'someone', 'else', 'so', 'again', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'watch', 'film', 'name', 'recognition', 'are', 'chancing', 'disappointment', 'when', 'big', 'stars', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'doing', 'too', 'much', 'said', 'everybody', 'generally', 'well', 'have', 'hand', 'star', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'making', 'most', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'kicking', 'butt', 'dramatic', 'offering', 'more', 'acceptable.Of', 'course', 'main', 'reason', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'butt-kicking', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'Mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'contradict', 'belief', 'best', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'produced', 'low-budget', 'fare', 'where', 'choreographical', 'creativity', 'can', 'be', 'embellished', 'not', 'stifled', 'whims', 'producers', 'majority', 'direct-to-video', 'MMA', 'movies', 'have', 'featured', 'truly', 'awful', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'better', 'bead', 'how', 'make', 'most', 'realistic', 'fighting', 'Haywire', 'great', 'example', 'Carano', 'six', 'fights', 'varying', 'lengths', 'film', 'say', 'redefine', 'how', 'powerful', 'woman', 'can', 'appear', 'onscreen', 'understatement', 'Even', 'like', 'only', 'four', 'brawls', 'include', 'standup', 'battle', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'people', ""'re"", 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'reconsider', 'place', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'fights', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'well-shot', 'Carano', 'same', 'sort', 'brutal', 'efficiency', 'Strikeforce', 'career', 'not', 'occasional', 'flashy', 'move', 'rebounding', 'roundhouse', 'wall', 'When', 'looking', 'really', 'still', 'being', 'entertaining', 'Gina', 'got', 'few', 'equals.The', 'production', 'strong', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Soderbergh', 'movie', 'European', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'location', 'others', 'are', 'fudged', 'authentic', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'anything', 'aesthetically', 'new', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', ""n't"", 'need', ""'re"", 'particularly', 'needy', 'car', 'chases', 'explosions', 'movie', 'what', 'action', 'picture', 'should', 'complete', 'lack', 'pretense', 'only', 'major', 'qualm', 'ending', 'nowhere', 'bit', 'too', 'soon', 'taste', 'can', 'live', 'Definitely', 'watch', 'probably', 'even', 'buy']",N/A

Carano falls somewhere in between. She definitely does not have the charisma of The Rock, and in this movie is very raw. You can tell that the script was written with that in mind. She is not good at conveying emotion. While she does have potential, and if she keeps at it and gets training, can probably be OK, her performance here is best described as wooden. You could not tell the difference between any emotional state. She was the same serious, angry, horny, and scared. She is basically there to look pretty and fight. And she does that well.There is a good backing ensemble cast that you can tell was put in place to support that fact that Carano was green. Unfortunately the script was such that they even the A list actors in the cast could do much. All that said, if you are in to action movies, and can handle a so so script and marginal acting ability from the lead role, this can be enjoyable.

Soderbergh conceived the film as a vehicle for mixed martial arts fighter Gina Carano, who has an imposing combination of good looks, physicality, and charisma. Soderbergh filmed, directed, and edited the film, but he did not write it. That job went to Lem Dobbs, who gives us a storyline sufficiently convoluted that it gives the audience the impression it is watching a spy thriller. But this is basically a chase film, with a great cast, that showcases Gina Carano's charms and skills in a series of great hand-to-hand combat scenes.Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is on the run in the car of a young man named Scott (Michael Angarano), who happened to be available when she was attacked by ex-colleague Aaron (Channing Tatum). As she drives with injured arm, she tells Scott why and from whom she is running. It began in Barcelona, where Mallory was sent by her employer Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) to rescue a dissident journalist who had been kidnapped. All went well; the team split up and headed home. But experiences on her next  job in Dublin led Mallory to believe that she's being set up. Government agent Alex Coblenz (Michael Douglas), who contracts with her security firm, seems to know this but is more interested in discovering Kenneth's motives than in helping Mallory.I admire the spareness of this film. ""Haywire"" is only 93 minutes long. No CGI. No explosions. Just running, fighting, a car chase, and some tantalizing scenes in which Mallory interacts with fellow contractors. They never trust one another. Female action heroines don't usually make much of an impression. The exceptions are Sigourney Weaver of the ""Alien"" franchise and Angelina Jolie, who has had moderate success as an action star. Both of those women are tall, with features striking enough to hold their own onscreen beside men and artillery. Gina Carano goes one better, as she is really a fighter. She does action in real life. I love the visceral quality of ""Haywire""s fights.I especially love Mallory's fight in a cocktail dress. Usually when women get into physical altercations while wearing a skirt in a movie, it's preposterous. But Mallory kicks off her heels, the dress tears at the seam, her pantyhose run, while she beats the stuffing out of someone. It's down and dirty and glamorous too. -Though I was moved to some pity for the men; the actors must have been black and blue from head to toe. There were no stunt doubles. ""Haywire"" is an exercise in style. There is not much plot. The device by which Mallory recounts the story to Scott, so that we enter midway in the narrative, is clumsy. But ""Haywire"" is seductive and energetic, and that is all one asks of an action flick.The DVD (LionsGate 2012): There are two featurettes. ""Gina Carano in Training"" (16 min) interviews Jamie Levine of World Extreme Fighting, Stephen Soderbergh, some of the cast, Special Ops technical advisor Aaron Cohen, fight choreographer J J Perry, and Gina Carano about the conception of the film, preparation, and behind-the-scenes insight into the three main fight scenes. ""The Men of Haywire"" (5 min) interviews Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, and Channing Tatum about what attracted them to the project and working/fighting with Carano.

1529615,A3G4MPMSA9T3HK,B007C4ZJ0S,M. Mierendorf,"[6, 7]","By Drew Morton for Cultural Transmogrifier[...]Back in 1999 - it is hard to believe that it's already been more than a decade - director Steven Soderbergh was in the midst of a career upswing. He rocked the landscape of American independent cinema in 1989 with his award winning, high-grossing art film Sex, Lies, and Videotape. Yet, over the subsequent decade, his career floundered. His follow up, Kafka (1991) - his first collaboration with screenwriter Lem Dobbs - led to much head scratching. Here was a film with Jeremy Irons and Alec Guiness that constructed a fictional narrative around Franz Kafka while drawing on pieces of Kafka's work. Essentially, it's an anti-biopic biopic, shot in black and white with some color sequences, and nobody saw it. Soderbergh's string of failures continued after Kafka, and it wasn't until 1998 that he came back on the industrial radar with the critically beloved and modestly successful Out of Sight. After Out of Sight, his phone started to ring (and it hasn't stopped since), and he picked Lem Dobbs's neo-noir The Limey (1999) to be his comeback piece.I offer this context because the colorful collaboration between Dobbs and Soderbergh (one need only listen to the commentary on The Limey to get the lowdown) has never really changed. Like a pair of Jean-Luc Godards, Soderbergh and Dobbs pick a genre and strip it down to its essentials in order to go beyond it. Together again on Haywire (2012), the pair have made a revenge flick about a female spy, Mallory Kane (Gina Carano), who after being betrayed by the men for whom she works (Channing Tatum, Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, and Antonio Banderas), returns to kick some ass...and maybe get a few answers.Like The Limey, Haywire isn't big on traditional characterization or exposition (it turns exposition into a running joke actually). The Limey used thirty-year-old footage of Terrence Stamp to add motivation, whereas Haywire draws on the tried and true - the scorned woman - in order to move on to other concerns. Yet, while the plot is rather conventional, the beauty is in the execution...literally. Quite simply, Haywire offers some of the best choreographed, shot, edited, scored, and mixed fight scenes since The Matrix(1999). While some may prefer the arthritic tremor of the Bourne films (2002, 2004, 2007), Soderbergh's geography is always well-defined; the action is always legible while still being messy and energetic, and - unlike The Matrix - it feels tactile, untainted by digital effects (which worked in The Matrix because they took place within a digital world).Soderbergh's film succeeds for many reasons - from David Holmes's Eurofunk score (who scored Out of Sight and the Ocean's Trilogy as well), to the director's ability to get top talent in bit parts, and to the director's eye for film form (he shot and edited the film under pseudonyms). Yet, it owes its success primarily to Carano, a former Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter Soderbergh saw on television and around whom he decided to construct a movie. As a non-professional actress among a sea of stars, Carano, as Kane, possesses a guarded nature that, considering her character, makes the minimal dramatic material work before she performs acts of violence on her male enemies. After feeling letdown by Lisbeth Salander and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), I can get behind Kane as a heroine in a revenge flick because she's too smart and paranoid to wait to be victimized.",5,Go Haywire!,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,3493,"['Drew', 'Morton', 'Cultural', 'Transmogrifier', '[', 'Back', '1999', 'hard', 'believe', 'already', 'been', 'more', 'decade', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'midst', 'career', 'upswing', 'rocked', 'landscape', 'American', 'independent', 'cinema', '1989', 'award', 'winning', 'high-grossing', 'art', 'film', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'subsequent', 'decade', 'career', 'floundered', 'follow', 'up', 'Kafka', '1991', 'first', 'collaboration', 'screenwriter', 'Lem', 'Dobbs', 'led', 'much', 'head', 'scratching', 'Here', 'was', 'film', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'constructed', 'fictional', 'narrative', 'Franz', 'Kafka', 'drawing', 'pieces', 'Kafka', 'work', 'Essentially', 'anti-biopic', 'biopic', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'sequences', 'nobody', 'saw', 'Soderbergh', 'string', 'failures', 'continued', 'Kafka', 'was', ""n't"", '1998', 'came', 'back', 'industrial', 'radar', 'critically', 'beloved', 'modestly', 'successful', 'Out', 'Sight', 'Sight', 'phone', 'started', 'ring', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'picked', 'Lem', 'Dobbs', 'neo-noir', 'Limey', '1999', 'be', 'comeback', 'piece.I', 'offer', 'context', 'colorful', 'collaboration', 'Dobbs', 'Soderbergh', 'one', 'need', 'only', 'commentary', 'Limey', 'get', 'lowdown', 'never', 'really', 'changed', 'pair', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godards', 'Soderbergh', 'Dobbs', 'pick', 'genre', 'strip', 'down', 'essentials', 'order', 'go', 'Together', 'again', 'Haywire', '2012', 'pair', 'have', 'made', 'revenge', 'flick', 'female', 'spy', 'Mallory', 'Kane', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'who', 'being', 'betrayed', 'men', 'whom', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'kick', 'ass', 'maybe', 'get', 'few', 'Limey', 'Haywire', ""n't"", 'big', 'traditional', 'characterization', 'exposition', 'exposition', 'running', 'joke', 'actually', 'Limey', 'used', 'thirty-year-old', 'footage', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'add', 'motivation', 'whereas', 'Haywire', 'tried', 'true', 'scorned', 'woman', 'order', 'move', 'other', 'concerns', 'plot', 'rather', 'conventional', 'beauty', 'execution', 'literally', 'Quite', 'simply', 'Haywire', 'best', 'choreographed', 'shot', 'edited', 'scored', 'mixed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Matrix', '1999', 'may', 'prefer', 'arthritic', 'tremor', 'Bourne', 'films', '2002', '2004', '2007', 'Soderbergh', 'geography', 'always', 'well-defined', 'action', 'always', 'legible', 'still', 'being', 'messy', 'energetic', 'Matrix', 'tactile', 'untainted', 'digital', 'effects', 'worked', 'Matrix', 'took', 'place', 'digital', 'world', '.Soderbergh', 'film', 'many', 'reasons', 'David', 'Holmes', 'Eurofunk', 'score', 'who', 'scored', 'Out', 'Sight', 'Ocean', 'Trilogy', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'ability', 'get', 'top', 'talent', 'bit', 'parts', 'director', 'eye', 'film', 'form', 'shot', 'edited', 'film', 'pseudonyms', 'success', 'primarily', 'Carano', 'former', 'Mixed', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'MMA', 'fighter', 'Soderbergh', 'saw', 'television', 'whom', 'decided', 'construct', 'movie', 'non-professional', 'actress', 'sea', 'stars', 'Carano', 'Kane', 'guarded', 'nature', 'considering', 'character', 'minimal', 'dramatic', 'material', 'work', 'acts', 'violence', 'male', 'enemies', 'feeling', 'letdown', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', '2011', 'can', 'get', 'behind', 'Kane', 'heroine', 'revenge', 'flick', 'too', 'smart', 'paranoid', 'wait', 'be', 'victimized']",N/A
1529616,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B007C4ZJ0S,M. Oleson,"[96, 104]","The amazing Steven Soderbergh directs and elevates another film genre. Specifically, ""B"" movies that focus on espionage, intrigue and high action martial arts fighting. In an unusual mixture of actors, he brings in former MMA superstar and calendar girl Gina Carano as the headliner. She plays an agent for hire who works for one of those Blackwater-type firms that do a lot of the foreign dirty work for Uncle Sam. For some reason, she is believed to be expendable and is used as a pawn in a double-cross to kill a Chinese journalist in Spain.Unlike, the lithe Zoe Saldana in ""Columbiana"", Ms Carano is tall, firm and fully packed. The daughter of a former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, the beautiful fighter is very believable. She appears to be doing all of her own stunt work and from what I can discern without the aid of wiring and other devices. For example, in a rooftop chase she doesn't just leap up to grab a roof and catapult herself to the top. You can see the effort in her face. She's really doing this stuff! Her MMA skills also come into play with obvious boxing training. And you have to love it when she does a figure-4-leg-lock (sorry, I don't know the official name for the hold) around some guy's neck. She needs to get comfortable with the acting component of her new career, but she is far from terrible.Soderbergh also manages to bring into the mix an assortment of ""A"" list actors, who must have been begging to have their asses kicked by this girl. Michael Douglas is the government man (CIA?) who hires the mercenaries headed by Ewan McGregor and who is Mallory's (Carano) boss. Bill Paxton is her dad. Michael Fassbender (his scenes with Carano are priceless) is a rogue MI:6 agent. Channing Tatum is a co-worker and part time lover. Antonio Banderas is a middle man playing both sides. The plot isn't overly complicated and even makes sense but no one should confuse this movie as an Oscar contender or even the caliber of the new ""Mission: Impossible"" film, but it is fun, fast and furious and highly recommended.BLU RAY UPDATE (8-31-12): In this re-look at this terrific Soderbergh coming out party for Gina Carano, I'll focus on the Blu ray version.  The film looks terrific featuring scenes from hotel rooms to the ocean to bustling cities to the Colorado mountains.  Soderbergh presents a color palette unlike other films of the genre.  He's not afraid to use hues of yellow and brown mixed in with the usual basics.  The film has a 1080p transfer with an aspect ratio of 2.40:1.  The audio mix is also excellent with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix.  When I first saw this film I overlooked an early scene when Mallory (Carano) and her 3 partners rescue a Chinese journalist in Barcelona.  When a gunfight begins, the gun shots and bullet hits are muted to the extent they are dull thuds.  This allows the retro jazzy soundtrack to play loud and clear.  Very cool as is the whole movie.  The disc only has two extras and they total 21 minutes.  One is called ""Gina Carano in Training"" and the second is ""The Men of Haywire.""  I'd upgrade the film to 4.5 stars.",4,"BLU RAY update of Soderbergh's great ""B"" movie",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,3101,"['amazing', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'directs', 'film', 'genre', 'Specifically', 'B', 'movies', 'focus', 'espionage', 'intrigue', 'high', 'action', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighting', 'unusual', 'mixture', 'actors', 'former', 'MMA', 'superstar', 'calendar', 'girl', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'headliner', 'agent', 'hire', 'who', 'one', 'Blackwater-type', 'firms', 'do', 'lot', 'foreign', 'dirty', 'work', 'Uncle', 'Sam', 'reason', 'believed', 'be', 'expendable', 'used', 'pawn', 'double-cross', 'kill', 'Chinese', 'journalist', 'Spain.Unlike', 'lithe', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Columbiana', 'Ms', 'Carano', 'tall', 'firm', 'fully', 'packed', 'daughter', 'former', 'Dallas', 'Cowboys', 'quarterback', 'beautiful', 'fighter', 'very', 'believable', 'be', 'doing', 'own', 'stunt', 'work', 'what', 'can', 'discern', 'aid', 'wiring', 'other', 'devices', 'example', 'rooftop', 'chase', ""n't"", 'just', 'leap', 'up', 'grab', 'roof', 'catapult', 'top', 'can', 'see', 'effort', 'face', 'really', 'doing', 'stuff', 'MMA', 'skills', 'also', 'come', 'play', 'obvious', 'boxing', 'training', 'have', 'love', 'when', 'figure-4-leg-lock', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'official', 'name', 'hold', 'guy', 'neck', 'get', 'comfortable', 'acting', 'component', 'new', 'career', 'far', 'terrible.Soderbergh', 'also', 'bring', 'mix', 'assortment', 'A', 'list', 'actors', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'begging', 'have', 'asses', 'kicked', 'girl', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'government', 'man', 'CIA', 'who', 'mercenaries', 'headed', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'who', 'Mallory', 'Carano', 'boss', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'dad', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'scenes', 'Carano', 'are', 'priceless', 'rogue', 'MI:6', 'agent', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'co-worker', 'part', 'time', 'lover', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'middle', 'man', 'playing', 'sides', 'plot', ""n't"", 'overly', 'complicated', 'even', 'sense', 'one', 'should', 'confuse', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'even', 'caliber', 'new', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'film', 'fun', 'fast', 'furious', 'highly', 'recommended.BLU', 'RAY', 'UPDATE', '8-31-12', 're-look', 'terrific', 'Soderbergh', 'coming', 'out', 'party', 'Gina', 'Carano', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', 'terrific', 'featuring', 'scenes', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'ocean', 'bustling', 'cities', 'Colorado', 'mountains', 'Soderbergh', 'color', 'palette', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'not', 'afraid', 'use', 'hues', 'yellow', 'brown', 'mixed', 'usual', 'basics', 'film', '1080p', 'transfer', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.40:1', 'audio', 'mix', 'also', 'excellent', 'lossless', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'mix', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'overlooked', 'early', 'scene', 'when', 'Mallory', 'Carano', '3', 'partners', 'rescue', 'Chinese', 'journalist', 'Barcelona', 'When', 'gunfight', 'gun', 'shots', 'bullet', 'hits', 'are', 'muted', 'extent', 'are', 'dull', 'thuds', 'retro', 'jazzy', 'soundtrack', 'play', 'loud', 'clear', 'Very', 'cool', 'whole', 'movie', 'disc', 'only', 'two', 'extras', 'total', '21', 'minutes', 'One', 'called', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'Training', 'second', 'Men', 'Haywire', ""'d"", 'upgrade', 'film', '4.5', 'stars']",N/A

I do not doubt Gina Carano's MMA credentials, but after watching this I sure do doubt her acting credentials. Looking pretty (even after having been beaten up) does not an actor make.  Perhaps the bigger name actors (Douglas and Banderos) were added to try and give the movie some credibility. If that were the case, it failed.Another reviewer stated that he watched the movie the whole way through in the hope that it may get better (which apparently did not happen). I managed to get about half way through it and just knew that it was never going to get better.  But hey, this is just my opinion. There may be some who find the movie appealing. If you do, great.

I just watched it and was wowed, but looks like it's not everyone's cup of tea, at least here on Amazon. All I can say is that, in addition to the raw, kickass fight scenes, the characters are quite deep and compelling, especially given how little time is permitted to sketch some of them within the confines of a fast-moving spy flick.Soderbergh is definitely a hit-or-miss director, and this one definitely has some of the usual trappings of his other movies. But to me, Haywire is a dead-on hit, and the Soderbergh cliches that are present (music by the always-funky David Holmes, quick, jargon-heavy, almost-noir dialogue by uber-attractive leads, a sense of seriousness that flirts with self-parody) are quite welcome b/c they're handled so well. To me, Haywire came across like a return to his roots, much more similar to the tightly-tuned and quietly powerful ""Out of Sight"" than to some of his later, more far/over-reaching efforts.Perhaps most surprising, I thought athlete Gina Carano was terrific as an actress -- imposing but still vulnerable, witty, and just very real (and smokin' hot, of course). And between this and 21 Jump Street, Channing Tatum is turning into quite a promising star. And all the other amazing, established A-list actors are as consistently great as always without overwhelming the movie with star power; what a cast!So definitely give this one a try if you like smart, raw action flix, you won't regret it.

1529641,AUDW8J8GH0IDO,B007C4ZJ0S,"ReAgent 6 ""Mixed media: movies, music and wha...","[1, 3]","Okay, okay I admit I did a bad thing by missing this movie when it was in theaters. I've watched Gina Carano in many Mixed Martial Arts events and always thought she would translate well in a movie as a kick-ass agent of destruction. We were teased by her cameo appearance in 2009's B-classic Blood and Bone as a street fighter. Tell me when she gave Isaiah Bone (main: Michael Jai White) her number- you weren't hoping she'd be seen again.And so, when a trailer emerges that shows Gina Carano doing the CIA-MMA combat style, you have to get amped. The trailer also showed Michael Douglas so you felt that the good acting was going to be handled by an able veteran. Add Ewan McGregor and Antonio Banderas and you have a can't-miss bundle. Well it has just arrived on rental and DVD so now I'm getting my chance to see Gina in action.Plot PloddingsAt about the 36 minute mark I realized I had no idea what was going on, why and who any of the characters were. I had to check myself to see if I had checked out and stopped paying attention and missed some clues. No, it's one of those movies where they leave it blurry and bring it into focus at the very end, which doesn't quite make sense since the overall plot is as simple as it seemed in the trailer: super agent is double-crossed and sets out on a mission to find out why and at the same time - seek revenge. It doesn't work to keep us in the dark about something we already knew walking in.Cut to the chaseLet's get to the action and choreography since that's supposed to be the meat of this flick.  In true fanboy service, you will get to see Gina Carano as freelance agent Mallory Kane pull off several bread and butter MMA moves- including the triangle, Muay Thai leg kicks and the superman punch. The only problem is; all the best moments are pretty much shown in the trailers. The early scenes are well edited and frenetic enough to warrant the name haywire, but later they begin to feel like set ups. It's as if the director looked at the clock and figured it was time for a mini-fight scene and placed the characters in, oh just enough peril to have a quick fight. By the time the climatic confrontation (Which you won't know is going down until the credits roll) occurs you'll be hoping you can see something different. Unfortunately the action plays out the same as the first fight and only the quick jump-cuts make the fight seem any different.Sometimes it feels like I've slipped from watching an action movie to watching an action reel meant to prove Gina Carano is a great action-hero fit. We have long shots of her running (for almost no damn reason), which proves she can run and look cool [like James Bond] and we have her in several outfits showing off her curves. She is also allowed to play it sexy, aloof and cool in a few quiet moments. Her action-acting resume is accepted. In much the same style as Hanna (2011 main: Saoirse Ronan) there are several scenes set to music as if we are watching a music video. And that's another bothersome point. It feels as if director Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Traffic, Erin Brockovich and Solaris +) was more concerned with getting a cool shot and placing the camera in an interesting place than following any kind of logical course of action for our heroine to take. To his credit, he may be a saving factor because removing those cool camera angles might have left some scenes looking very boring and plain. I mean, she's jumping over roof tops, but with no real sense of danger and no discernable reason to be doing so. She's not exactly trapped and the pursuing baddies aren't even sure where she is. So what's she doing besides looking awesome?In the end, I feel the whole is not equal to the sum of its parts. You have many underutilized, bankable actors, a great physical actress and a plot as simple as it gets. Sure there are scenes with creative camera work. Sure there are moments when MMA-lovers can cheer at the screen and call out the techniques being used, but overall this movie represents a first step in what I hope is the budding film career of Gina Carano. I can easily see her as a Bond villainess or arch nemesis in the next Charlie's Angels.

This is because Gina is *really* a badass. That she has enough acting chops to make you think she isn't just appearing in an extended cameo is a compliment to her. And this is why this movie (mostly) works in its goal of being a good action thriller.Her acting was spare, as someone else wrote, a sort of feminine Jason Statham. In other words, she knows her strengths and one of them isn't acting. She keeps the emotions spare and doesn't try to milk a scene which lets the movie flow.Not a legendary thriller action flick, but a good one that is worth the rental for a night. Weaknesses are the rather scatter-shot collection of Big Names brought in somewhat randomly in an attempt to flesh out the very spare plot. Outside of Channing Tatum, I thought the rest of the Big Names were almost slumming their way through the film.

1529648,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B007C4ZJ0S,RMurray847,"[2, 3]","HAYWIRE was a deeply disappointing movie.  Steven Soderbergh has helmed some truly outstanding movies over the year, and when I heard that he was making his own action-thriller with a great cast...I was pretty pumped.My first hint that this movie might not be great was in his casting of Gina Carano, a well-known MMA star, in the lead.  She brought limited acting experience to the film, which Soderbergh essentially crafted for her.  This is similar to the way in which he created GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE to showcase porn star Sasha Gray in a ""legit"" role.  The movie was well-nigh unwatchable, and Gray was okay at best.  Carano is also okay at best.  She's supposed to be carrying an entire movie on her shoulders, but through no fault of her own, she isn't much of an actor.  She's got the action moves down, and I certainly believed she could kick the butt of all these male adversaries...but when required to show emotion, or humor, or determination or any recognizable emotion...her skills were pretty tiny.  Again, Soderbergh apparently saw ""movie star"" in her somewhere and crafted this project for her.  I don't blame her for letting him...but I also doubt we'll be seeing her in many lead roles in the near future.HAYWIRE tells the story of a black-ops agent (Carano) who has apparently been targeted for elimination by someone she knows as an ally.  The movie tells its story out-of-order...and frankly, I'm not sure there's a good reason for that.  It makes the story needlessly complicated, yet adds NOTHING to the suspense.  We're essentially going from one fight scene to another, and the plot is so thin and the explanations so sketchy...all we know is that we should be rooting FOR her and against anyone trying to kill her.  I suppose I could have given more effort to sorting out the plot specifics...but the movie is so murkily filmed and so un-involving from the get-go that I had no impetus for working that hard.I had hoped for a guilty-pleasure film...but I'm astonished to say that even a mediocre Jason Statham movie will give you more vicarious action thrills, and will skip the artsy pretense.  There is certainly a case to be made for ""artsy"" genre thrillers (DRIVE springs to mind)...but HAYWIRE is just boring.  Carano has some pretty high profile co-stars, but their roles are either tiny and undemanding (Bill Paxton, Michael Douglass, Antonio Banderas) or the actor can barely muster up any intensity for their role (Ewan McGregor is bland as Carano's boss and Michael Fassbender seems vaguely embarrassed to be in the film).  Channing Tatum generates momentary interest...but his dialogue is also mush-mouthed at times.It's tempting to give this film one-star, but I'll stick with two because if nothing else, the one-on-one fight scenes ring with some authenticity...people actually seem to get hurt.  I think Carano could be a nice small part of a bigger film...something like THE EXPENDIBLES, perhaps.

1529649,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B007C4ZJ0S,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Haywire (Steven Soderbergh, 2011)I'll start off with two confessions: (a) the last Steven Soderbergh movie I actually liked was 1999's The Limey, and (b) not a single review I read of Haywire before watching the film mentioned that it was directed by Steven Soderbergh, so when I added it to my Netflix queue, I had no idea it was anything other than the Gina Carano vehicle I'd seen it painted as so many times. Soderbergh earned my eternal scorn with the trio of remakes he did just after The Limey, which desecrated two of my favorite movies of all time (Ocean's 11 and Solyaris) and turned an interesting, intelligent TV miniseries into a brainless rah-rah-rah feature (Traffic) that begged me to turn it off at least once a minute for its entire length. And I rush to add that Haywire, brainless as it is, is nowhere as awful as that trio of obscenity, but all those ""Gina Carano vehicle"" reviews are right, in the classic sense of the term: this is a movie that focuses the viewer's attention on Carano despite there being the usual bevy of huge-name stars who seem to cleave to Soderbergh like remora sucking on hammerheads.Plot: MMA champ Carano plays Mallory Kane, an ex-government operative now working for a private company headed by Kenneth (Ewan MacGregor, whose very presence in a film spells doom). As we open, she's sitting in a little diner in upstate New York, waiting to be extracted after a botched operation. Aaron (Magic Mike's Channing Tatum), another operative, shows up. We get the idea from their conversation that he was somehow involved in the operation, but we don't have details yet. He attempts to forcibly abduct her when she refuses to go with him; despite being able to take care of herself, she is aided both by a waitress (stuntwoman Debby Ross Rondell in one of her few appearances as an actress) and Scott, an innocent bystander (Red State's Michael Angarano). Presumably, the waitress has to finish out her shift, so Kane--one of only three people in the film with a given last name--grabs Scott, heads out the door, commandeers his car, and spends most of the rest of the movie in flashback, telling him about said botched operation. It seems Kenneth sent her to Barcelona to extract a guy while partnered with an MI6 agent named Paul (Hunger's Michael Fassbender). Problem is, the guy in question ended up dead, as did Paul after he attempted to kill her, resulting in Kane doing a bunch of globetrotting with agents, cops, and pretty much the rest of the world on her trail--and now her fate is in the hands of a nineteen-year-old whose greatest achievement is having just bought a Prius. (I think it was a Prius.) Can Mallory, filtering all the data she has through Scott, figure out what went wrong before she ends up in the hands of people who obviously want her dead?I didn't even scrape the surface of the massive names here. The opening scene, where the Barcelona job is hashed out, has MacGregor in a room with Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas, who's a really good friend of Matthieu Kassovitz' (if the name isn't as familiar as those first three, go grab yourself a copy of La Haine posthaste. I'll wait). Kane's father is played by Bill Paxton; the guy they're supposed to extract is Anthony Brandon Wong, from the Matrix franchise. I could go on and on. And while Carano is a decent enough actor for genre work, it's kind of ridiculous to expect her to hold her own with a cast of that caliber. But...she does.And here's where my problems with Steven Soderbergh come to the fore. Here's a guy who, at the beginning of his career, was notable for getting fantastic performances out of his actors; was Andie MacDowell ever better than she was in sex, lies, and videotape? But once you get past Terence Stamp kicking ass and taking names in The Limey, and the similarity of Stamp's role there and Carano's here has not escaped me, Soderbergh seems to have gone the exact opposite way. Everyone in this movie save Carano and MacGregor, who is never capable of acting even up to the ""meh"" level, gives a performance best characterized as ""meh"". Which, by default, makes Carano the standout. How does that happen in a movie containing Michael Fassbender, who's under consideration by a whole lot of people I know as the Best Actor Working in Movies Today (TM)? It has to be Soderbergh's direction.That said, if you're looking for a turn-your-brain-off action picture that showcases Gina Carano doing a whole lot of what she does best--beating people up--than Haywire is as good a choice as anything. But, man, Lem Dobbs' script is all over the place, way too complex and not nearly enough fun. Dobbs has always been inconsistent; I still have a hard time believing the guy who wrote the sublime Dark City was also responsible for the ridiculous Hider in the House (we'll also note in passing: guess who wrote The Limey?). This, however, represents a new low for Dobbs, if not for Soderbergh. **",2,The (Imported) Limey,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,4944,"['Haywire', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', '2011', ""'ll"", 'start',

One of the worst action films I  have ever seen.  There are many fight scenes but they all appear incredibly choreographed and highly unrealistic.  I know that all fight scenes in all movies are choreographed but in Haywire, you can almost imagine the actors whispering to each other, 'Okay, take a left swing here; I'll duck and throw an elbow there""  The storyline was a bit confusing but worst of all, none of the characters had character.  In any good movie, the villain and the hero  or heroin are people you are either rooting for or against.  They make you feel something.  The characters in Haywire make you feel nothing but wanting to look at your watch to see how much more there is left in the film so you can put something else good on.  Michael Douglas and other stars are phoning in their performances for a paycheck and they phone pretty well.  It's just that there is nothing in this very low budget movie that creates any real tension or sympathy for anyone.  It appears that most of the interior shots were all roughly in the same local, exteriors as well.  I wonder how much this film actually took to make.

It was acceptable B -  movie fare by a thread but Soderbergh was either asleep or leaving most of the directing duties to a 12 year old. The story, the talent and, probably, the money demanded something better. This could have been Carano's  'Enter the Dragon' but played out like a big budget episode of any current television actioner.It really irks me when there are so many of the right cards being held and then, some where along the way, the holder chokes on a simple bet and loses on a beautiful straight.I REALLY want to see Gina Carano in more films. She held up her end of things in this one and has credible acting chops to stride along with the physicality of her role and she's hot. This could have been in league with a Bourne flick and even surpassed 'Salt' just with Carano's obviously full inclusive stunt work.There was no use of any true camera artistry that wasn't laughable in the 80's.  Steven Soderbergh has done some great films  and owed the entire cast better attention.Bill Paxton has mere moments of screen time but owns his part as does Micheal Douglas.

Gina Carano was critiqued as being ""strong, fast, relentless"" and I'd have to agree.  She more than holds her own as Mallory Kane, a black ops badass who is about to get out of the business but is pulled in for that one last job.  After reading what I just wrote I can see how many people would groan, but you need not!  The story is packed with verve and visceral fights, showcasing an engaging Carano in one-on-one knockdowns as well as beating up multiple bogeys.  But it is the one-on-one fights that really shine as she goes against men that look the bigger and stronger.  It certainly doesn't hurt that Soderbergh pulled in a lot of stars (from the ""it"" man Channing Tatum to Obi Wan Kenobi himself, Ewan McGregor).  The story contains a few twists that are tidied up by story's end and it all ends satisfactorily for our heroine.This actioner plays by the rules for the most part and doesn't try to twist your brain inside out or make you think than it is more than it is.  I appreciate that especially when the film is exciting.  Two scenes that stand out in my mind still after watching it several months ago are the coffee shop ambush where Carano goes up against a brutish and heavy-handed Tatum and in the hotel where she and her partner, spies posing as a married couple, do a brutal and bashing dance to the death.  This was much more satisfying (and even felt believeable) than anything that, say, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" ever threw at us.If you like action movies then check this one out.

Whatever he makes, he brings in something new into the material, and ""Haywire"" is no exception. It is stylishly shot. It avoids loud music and big effects. It has some authentic martial arts action stunts. It has a mouth-watering cast that includes Michael Angarano, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Mathieu Kassovitz, Ewan McGregor, Bill Paxton and Channing Tatum. And it is boring. Yes, ""Haywire"" has styles, but that doesn't mean it is a great movie.""Haywire"" is about a vengeful black ops agent Mallory Kane played by Gina Carano. This is basically an action movie template that is used differently. The lead is Mallory, a strong female agent. The car chase ends up in an unexpected fashion. The rooftop chase sequence unfolds more slowly (and realistically) than those of usual Hollywood blockbusters. I see the point. Still I must say the film is dull.For the film's story goes nowhere. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, whose penchant for experimental film techniques is well known among filmgoers, ""Haywire"" goes back and forth in time, showing bits of action here and there, giving us clues as to what happened and is happening.

1529690,A38RTTX1916P52,B007C4ZJ0S,Vykoden,"[29, 49]","Roger Ebert gave this movie three (out of four) stars, primarily because MMA champ Gina Carano appears to use her MMA skills in the fight scenes and because of the film's all-star cast. Note: Ebert did not remark on Carano's acting skills or lack thereof. According to Ebert's users, the movie deserved 2.5 stars.The first person to comment on this movie, in Amazon, gave it 5 stars and said it was non-stop action. Whoever wrote that garbage had to have been high. In the first hour of the movie, there were a total of four fight scenes; all of which totaled about 5 minutes of combined time. One of the fight scenes is only about 20 seconds, which came after a 1-minute chase scene in which Carano's character is running after ""Bad Guy #1"" through the streets of Barcelona. The majority of the first hour, you're left watching boring dialogues with very few words. Carano (Mallory Kane) actually does very little speaking the entire film - primarily because she's not an actress; she's an MMA competitor.Ebert was also correct, when he criticized the director of the movie, Steven Soderbergh. This was Soderbergh's first attempt at an action thriller, and hopefully, it will be his last. The script was horrible, the plot was hideously cliche, and even the fight scenes were very obviously and very poorly choreographed. If you're hoping for a ""Bourne"" or ""Salt"" style action sequence, you won't find it here. In some fight scenes, you can actually watch the actors manipulate each other into the next move... like in one scene, you can picture hearing Carano say ""Pick your arm up, so I can get you in a sleeper hold."" LOL.The funniest aspect of the whole thing was that Carano's character gets punched and kicked in the face multiple times, and at one point, she actually gets a cup of hot coffee thrown in her face, and she never shows even as much as an abrasion. No blood, no bruising... not even some redness or blistering caused by the hot coffee. I found this to be pretty hilariously stupid. I don't know how anyone can get punched in the face five or six times and not even show a bruise. This gave the movie a professional wrestling feel... like ""It's obviously not real, because she doesn't even have a bloody lip.""...Not that I expect movies to be real, but I do expect them to be realistic, or as realistic as possible, if they're not animated. Even fist fights in the old TV show ""Gunsmoke"" showed people with bloody lips and noses, so it seems pretty lame when a movie is made today, in which nobody ever gets so much as a visible blemish on their face.If you're an MMA fan, or if you're a Carano fan, you will probably love this movie, because it lacks the choreography movie goers enjoy in good Hollywood action movies.But, if you're an action/thriller/espionage fan with a sweet tooth for well-made fight scenes and conspiracy theories, save your money for the next Bourne movie, because everything about this movie blows in every way from start to the bitter end.",1,I should have listened to Ebert's users,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,2985,"['Roger', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'movie', 'three', 'four', 'stars', 'primarily', 'MMA', 'champ', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'use', 'MMA', 'skills', 'fight', 'scenes', 'film', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Note', 'Ebert', 'did', 'not', 'remark', 'Carano', 'acting', 'skills', 'lack', 'thereof', 'According', 'Ebert', 'users', 'movie', 'deserved', '2.5', 'stars.The', 'first', 'person', 'comment', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'said', 'was', 'non-stop', 'action', 'Whoever', 'wrote', 'garbage', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'were', 'total', 'four', 'fight', 'scenes', 'totaled', '5', 'minutes', 'combined', 'time', 'One', 'fight', 'scenes', 'only', 'about', '20', 'seconds', 'came', '1-minute', 'chase', 'scene', 'Carano', 'character', 'running', 'Bad', 'Guy', '1', 'streets', 'Barcelona', 'majority', 'first', 'hour', ""'re"", 'left', 'watching', 'boring', 'dialogues', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'Carano', 'Mallory', 'Kane', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'speaking', 'entire', 'film', 'primarily', 'not', 'actress', 'MMA', 'competitor.Ebert', 'was', 'also', 'correct', 'when', 'criticized', 'director', 'movie', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'Soderbergh', 'first', 'attempt', 'action', 'thriller', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'script', 'was', 'horrible', 'plot', 'was', 'hideously', 'cliche', 'even', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'obviously', 'very', 'poorly', 'choreographed', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'Bourne', 'Salt', 'style', 'action', 'sequence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'fight', 'scenes', 'can', 'actually', 'watch', 'actors', 'manipulate', 'other', 'next', 'move', 'one', 'scene', 'can', 'picture', 'hearing', 'Carano', 'say', 'Pick', 'arm', 'up', 'can', 'get', 'sleeper', 'hold', 'LOL.The', 'funniest', 'aspect', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'Carano', 'character', 'punched', 'kicked', 'face', 'multiple', 'times', 'one', 'point', 'actually', 'cup', 'hot', 'coffee', 'thrown', 'face', 'never', 'even', 'as', 'much', 'abrasion', 'blood', 'bruising', 'not', 'even', 'redness', 'blistering', 'caused', 'hot', 'coffee', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'hilariously', 'stupid', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'get', 'punched', 'face', 'five', 'six', 'times', 'not', 'even', 'show', 'bruise', 'gave', 'movie', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'feel', 'obviously', 'not', 'real', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'bloody', 'lip', 'Not', 'expect', 'movies', 'be', 'real', 'do', 'expect', 'be', 'realistic', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', ""'re"", 'not', 'animated', 'Even', 'fist', 'fights', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'Gunsmoke', 'showed', 'people', 'bloody', 'lips', 'noses', 'pretty', 'lame', 'when', 'movie', 'made', 'today', 'nobody', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'visible', 'blemish', 'face.If', ""'re"", 'MMA', 'fan', ""'re"", 'Carano', 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'choreography', 'movie', 'goers', 'enjoy', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movies.But', ""'re"", 'action/thriller/espionage', 'fan', 'sweet', 'tooth', 'well-made', 'fight', 'scenes', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'save', 'money', 'next', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'everything', 'movie', 'way', 'start', 'bitter', 'end']",N/A

But let's get one thing straight here. Gina Carano is at best, a stunt woman. She is not and will never be an actress. The girl can't act, period the end.Her character was quite bland as was her acting. But her fight scenes? Those were the stars of the show. In fact, it was only because of the fight scenes that I wanted to watch the movie. (Well and the fact that it's a female lead.)When Hollywood complains that female leads don't draw in audiences. It's because movies like this which should have great potential, are done so poorly. I am a huge supporter of female lead movies and even wrote a book about a superheroine lead. But this movie is not a step in the right direction. She is so poorly written, the movie so poorly done, it felt like I was watching a student film.Need a more in-depth breakdown? All right, let's get this done before I'm late for dinner.1.) Who thought it was a smart idea to have a piss colored yellow filter over almost all the shots? It's hideous, it's distracting, and an overbearing vignette makes the movie look much darker than it should.2.) The music was so out of place for this movie. I kept on expecting Bruce Lee to pop up and for the camera to do a rapid zoom in to the close up shots. Terrible selection of music which ruined the mood and atmosphere of the whole movie. It was very campy and didn't mesh well with anything in this movie.3.) Where the hell is the tension? News flash to the editor. Cutting a bunch of scenes of Gina Carano running around without someone actually chasing her. Is very boring. Having her chase someone through Spain without even the obligatory fruit cart turn over, is boring. Sitting on a shot of her reversing a car for almost 2 minutes, IS BORING!What the hell where they thinking with this movie? Everything was so drawn out and so padded, and so damn boring. Take a note from the James Bond movies, they know how to do a foot chase.4.) Poorly written script with awful dialogue. I didn't feel surprised or shocked with any of the reveals in the movie because they just weren't that interesting and have been done to death.So I did a bit of homework and checked IMDB. So apparently Steven did the cinematography and the editing.Sorry dude, I have great respect for you as an intelligent man, but you're fired.If you're looking for a heart pounding action movie with a bad ass female lead.
