1119596,A3GBS13EUHBDAR,B000YENUJ0,"B. Poole ""bradiane777""","[12, 12]","I bought this DVD because I'm disabled due to a back condition. I get very little exercise so I really needed something that was low impact, yet would get my heart rate up a little. I was very impressed with it. It's not too hard (I couldn't do his older ones now) yet it works up a sweat and gets the heart rate going. With my condition, I'm not able to do it everyday but it's still something I can do. It's not too long, keeps you moving and has a great cool down session. If you want a hard workout with lots of talking that takes at least an hour, then this isn't for you. If you need to warm up, do a low impact workout, cool down and not spend a huge amount of time on the workout, then this is perfect.  There isn't a lot of bending, which I can't do.  Even though I can't do it everyday, it is the only work out that I have found that I can do at all. It's also fun!",5,Much better than the older ones,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,875,"['bought', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'disabled', 'due', 'back', 'condition', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'exercise', 'so', 'really', 'needed', 'something', 'was', 'low', 'impact', 'yet', 'would', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'little', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'older', 'ones', 'now', 'yet', 'up', 'sweat', 'heart', 'rate', 'going', 'condition', ""'m"", 'not', 'able', 'do', 'everyday', 'still', 'something', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'moving', 'great', 'cool', 'down', 'session', 'want', 'hard', 'workout', 'lots', 'talking', 'least', 'hour', 'then', ""n't"", 'need', 'warm', 'up', 'do', 'low', 'impact', 'workout', 'cool', 'down', 'not', 'spend', 'huge', 'amount', 'time', 'workout', 'then', 'perfect', ""n't"", 'lot', 'bending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'everyday', 'only', 'work', 'have', 'found', 'can', 'do', 'also', 'fun']",Sweatin' to the Oldies

I used this way back when I first starting working out as a young adult and now that I have MS I am now needing a basic easier to follow workout guide. I had loaned out my other one and never got it back so I purchased this again and even though I can't do all of the exercises, I am not intimidated my Richard Simmons because he is so nice and encouraging. This has been a tough journey for me to go from healthy to basically living in my bedroom and needing a wheelchair to go any distances larger than my own yard. I lost my career as an RN of which broke my heart. One of the bright spots in my day is listening to Richard Simmons encouraging me to do what I can and that is better than doing nothing at all.

But great if you're more than 50 lbs. overweight since it's low impact.  Simmons is self-indulgent and seems to be doing the steps as they come to him.  We're not given any warning or heads up when he suddenly goes into the next bit.  The live band is a distraction (as good as they are) because Simmons bounces and squeals like a school girl after every song.  I just want a challenging, no-nonsense workout, please.
