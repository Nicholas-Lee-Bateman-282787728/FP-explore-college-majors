1433877,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004YM6JVO,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[33, 35]","There's no doubt `The Glades' compares to `Midsomer Murders.' Skilled copper, multiple crimes, additional plots, romantic moments, and comedy also in the mix. The Glades takes place in Palm Glades, a fictitious small town Florida (somewhere near the Everglades), while Midsomer is rural English villages. Glades storylines take into account Florida history, out-of-the-way settings, habitats, politics, animal life, ethnic diversity, and of courts FL-style murder. Also expect many bathing beauties--it's Florida.  Like Midsomer, Glade makes use of MANY guest stars, too numerous to mention. Includes contemporary music worked into the story. Murder solving is by the episode but other relationship plots are ongoing from the beginning pilot in Season 1 through this set of stories.Returning: Jim Longworth (Matt Passmore, an Aussie using American accent recognized only by bonus material in Series 1 DVD) is a top crime solver, but knows it and up-talks everyone from his boss to his partner. Capable of his own quick funny jabs, forensic med. examiner Carlos (Carlos Gomez-a real Cuban/American playing one in a super performance) is an extra smart Dr. while FDLE boss Colleen (Michelle Hurd-who began in the pilot as a barmaid, is stunning as well as in charge). Tough and hot, as quick-witted as Longworth, Callie (Kiele Sanchez) is a nurse with a kid Jeff (Uriah Shelton) and jailbird husband Ray (Clyne Crawford) but he's about to be released for narking aid, and Callie will soon gain new employment. The new employment only adds to the romantic conflict for her and Longworth, sometimes generating spontaneous frivolity. The great regulars must include Daniel (Jordan Wall-FL local actor making it big in this series) intern who's funny, quick, smart, and a good bit of a computer nerd.Episodes for season 2 (SUBTITLED)1 FAMILY MATTERS-2 OLD GHOSTS-3 LOST AND FOUND- `new' forensic nurse introduced4 MOONLIGHTING-5 LITTLE DIRTY SECRETS-6 GIBTOWN- a town of the strange and bizarre7 ADDICTED TO LOVE-8 SECOND SKIN-9 IRON PIPELINE-10 SWAMP THING-Can the success continue to Season 3? Surely! Midsomer (look it up, it's fantastic) began in 1997 and continues non-stop. Two great murder series to own. Like Midsomer Murders, The Glades have already proven themselves to be one to buy early, I want to own every episode.

1433878,ALIAV59AW2TRM,B004YM6JVO,Howard Nemerov,"[3, 3]","The first season was a pleasant surprise. The interactions between Jim and Callie were well-scripted, showing a realistic view of two people with past relationship issues who were attracted, but wanting to get it right for a change. Fortunately, this continues into the second season. The first season's plots were well-written. It was hard to guess who the perpetrator was most of the time. This is a challenge to do, having to avoid all the lazy ""butler did it"" scenarios to create a good plot.Unfortunately, the second season's plots began to fail on this important note. The show became preachy, the bad guys more stereotypical, and action scenes sometimes became amateurish, indicating a drop in production values and script writing.For example, Jim confronts a non-suspect customer in a gun store suspected of gun running, telling the customer to hire an exterminator instead of buying a gun to deal with his ""rodent problem."" Granted, the buyer may have been lying. However, this scene represents the producers' simplistic view of gun ownership and their promotion of the gun control agenda, where civilians must obtain police permission in order to buy a gun. In the real world, the customer would have cause to file a lawsuit against the state of Florida and the officer for assault, because Jim had no probable cause to grab a gun out of his hands and shove him. This episode also included law enforcement repeating another gun control standard about the availability of guns on the street.In other episodes where teams entered a suspect residence to clear it, there's a bit of sweeping going on, where one officer points the muzzle of his gun at another officer as they move through the house. The producers didn't seem to want to pay for room clearing drills to train the actors properly.Another unrealistic scene is where Jim shoots to wound on purpose. Of course, any decent person doesn't want to kill another, but real gun battles aren't so neat and pretty that you can call your shots while somebody else tries to kill you. Tactical shooting teaches defenders to shoot to stop. Where the bullets hit while accomplishing that goal is impossible to plan beforehand, especially when the defender will feel lucky just to be the one walking away.In the second season finale, this unrealistic gun handling reached a peak. Numerous times, a perpetrator pointed a gun at Jim with no ensuing defensive action. Granted, this may be an option (though risky) during a hostage situation where the perpetrator is simply posturing in order to improve his bargaining position. However, by law that's considered aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, justifying the use of potentially lethal defensive force for both police and private citizens. When they did this again in a later scene with no hostages, having Jim slap the pistol out of the perpetrator's hands is likely to end in the defender's death in real life.If you can live with decreasing technical production values, this is still one of the better TV cop shows currently running. The script is often funny, the supporting characters add depth, and most of the plots fair to good.",3,One of the better TV cop shows,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,3144,"['first', 'season', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'interactions', 'Jim', 'Callie', 'were', 'well-scripted', 'showing', 'realistic', 'view', 'two', 'people', 'past', 'relationship', 'issues', 'who', 'were', 'attracted', 'wanting', 'get', 'right', 'change', 'Fortunately', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'plots', 'were', 'well-written', 'was', 'hard', 'guess', 'who', 'perpetrator', 'was', 'most', 'time', 'challenge', 'do', 'having', 'avoid', 'lazy', 'butler', 'did', 'scenarios', 'create', 'good', 'plot.Unfortunately', 'second', 'season', 'plots', 'began', 'fail', 'important', 'note', 'show', 'became', 'preachy', 'bad', 'guys', 'more', 'stereotypical', 'action', 'scenes', 'sometimes', 'became', 'amateurish', 'indicating', 'drop', 'production', 'values', 'script', 'writing.For', 'example', 'Jim', 'non-suspect', 'customer', 'gun', 'store', 'suspected', 'gun', 'running', 'telling', 'customer', 'hire', 'exterminator', 'instead', 'buying', 'gun', 'deal', 'rodent', 'problem', 'Granted', 'buyer', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lying', 'However', 'scene', 'producers', 'simplistic', 'view', 'gun', 'ownership', 'promotion', 'gun', 'control', 'agenda', 'where', 'civilians', 'must', 'obtain', 'police', 'permission', 'order', 'buy', 'gun', 'real', 'world', 'customer', 'would', 'have', 'cause', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'state', 'Florida', 'officer', 'assault', 'Jim', 'had', 'probable', 'cause', 'grab', 'gun', 'hands', 'shove', 'episode', 'also', 'included', 'law', 'enforcement', 'repeating', 'gun', 'control', 'standard', 'availability', 'guns', 'street.In', 'other', 'episodes', 'where', 'teams', 'entered', 'suspect', 'residence', 'clear', 'bit', 'sweeping', 'going', 'where', 'one', 'officer', 'muzzle', 'gun', 'officer', 'move', 'house', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'pay', 'room', 'clearing', 'drills', 'train', 'actors', 'unrealistic', 'scene', 'where', 'Jim', 'wound', 'purpose', 'course', 'decent', 'person', ""n't"", 'want', 'kill', 'real', 'gun', 'battles', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'neat', 'pretty', 'can', 'call', 'shots', 'somebody', 'else', 'tries', 'kill', 'Tactical', 'shooting', 'teaches', 'defenders', 'shoot', 'stop', 'Where', 'bullets', 'hit', 'accomplishing', 'goal', 'impossible', 'plan', 'beforehand', 'especially', 'when', 'defender', 'will', 'feel', 'lucky', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'walking', 'second', 'season', 'finale', 'unrealistic', 'gun', 'handling', 'reached', 'peak', 'Numerous', 'times', 'perpetrator', 'pointed', 'gun', 'Jim', 'ensuing', 'defensive', 'action', 'Granted', 'may', 'be', 'option', 'risky', 'hostage', 'situation', 'where', 'perpetrator', 'simply', 'posturing', 'order', 'improve', 'bargaining', 'position', 'However', 'law', 'considered', 'aggravated', 'assault', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'justifying', 'use', 'potentially', 'lethal', 'defensive', 'force', 'police', 'private', 'citizens', 'When', 'did', 'again', 'later', 'scene', 'hostages', 'having', 'Jim', 'slap', 'pistol', 'perpetrator', 'hands', 'likely', 'end', 'defender', 'death', 'real', 'life.If', 'can', 'live', 'decreasing', 'technical', 'production', 'values', 'still', 'one', 'better', 'TV', 'cop', 'currently', 'running', 'script', 'often', 'funny', 'supporting', 'characters', 'add', 'depth', 'most', 'plots', 'fair', 'good']",The Glades: Season 2

Jim Longworth (Matt Passmore) a Chicago detective, who took his payout after being falsely accused of sleeping with his captain's wife. Looking for a less hectic law enforcement job he lands at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) in the make-believe town of Palm Glade, Florida.He meets, and becomes infatuated with Callie Cargill (Kiele Sanchez). She is married. Her husband, Ray, is in prison, but she plans to wait on him to return, reformed and ready to start over with her and her 13-year-old son, Jeff. It's the chemistry between these two characters which keeps The Glades fresh and interesting. It reminds me of the relationship between Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan (Emily Deschanel) and FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) on Bones.By the start of Season 2, Callie has decided to divorce Ray, who has just been released. The problem is Ray does appear to have reformed. He asks her for three months to prove himself and re-bond with her son. She decides to trust him, and give him the time with Jeff, but keeps any of his romantic advances at bay.Jim's former partner and lover from Chicago, Detective Samanatha Harper (Natalia Cigliuti) comes to Florida, putting a little peg between Jim and Callie.

1433882,A33MDQZWJ5NZE4,B004YM6JVO,Karl P. Madsen,"[1, 1]","How is it that there can be so many police shows on T.V., and yet every fall new cop shows get aired and every spring some of those shows get renewed? Do you ever wonder if there is just that much crime to go around? We've looked at cops as rookies and veterans, beat cops and detectives, homicide, vice, forensics and Internal Affairs. The police have operated in the cities and country, north and south, east and west. We've visited the past, gone to the future, and even been protected by mythical creatures. In my opinion, it's the characters that are well developed, quirky, and a group dynamic that evolves, changes, but never becomes dull. The Glades seems to fit the criteria.Last season we learned that Jim Longworth (Matt Passmore - Masterwork) is a Chicago detective who moved to Florida after his captain shot him in the backside. Callie Cargill (Kiele Sanchez - 30 Days of Night: Dark Days) is a nurse, med student, and struggling single mom to Jeff (Uriah Shelton - Blue) and wife to Ray (Clayne Crawford - 24), a convicted armed robber doing time up-state. It's because of Ray's profession, and separation that allows Jim and Callie to become friends. Since Jim locked up his first partner for killing his wife, he teams up with medical examiner, Carlos Sanchez (Carlos Gomez - Shark), and paid intern and gopher Daniel Green (Jordan Wall - The Summoning).  Rounding out the group is Coleen Manus (Michelle Hurd - 90210), the precinct captain.At the end of season one Jim was making a name for himself as a detective, he and Callie had finally figured out their relationship, and we found out that Ray had snitched to get out of prison early. The Glades: Season Two starts out with Jim and Callie dealing with the return of Ray, and a case from Chicago shows up in Florida which also brings Jims former partner and lover, Det. Sam Harper (Natalia Cigluiti - Raising the Bar).  Did I mention that a jealous and insecure Callie has been hired as a forensic nurse to assist Carlos, and a somewhat jealous and confused Jim on their cases? Entertaining for us, not so much for them. But crime fighting goes on and cases are solved involving race car drivers, sailors and poachers, moonshiners, circus folk, medical examiners, human traffickers, mobsters, and your plain old serial killer.Episode Listing:Episode 1 - Family Matters - Jim is put on the case when a daughter of a Cuban Mob member is found dead.Episode 2 - Old Ghosts - When Detective Samantha Harper, a woman from Jim's past, comes to Florida, Jim and her have to team up before a killer kills again.Episode 3 - Lost and Found - The body of a Navy Recruiter is found, and a baby's life may be in danger if the killer isn't found.Episode 4 - Moonlighting - When a 12-year-old girl gets pulled over and the police find the body of a NASCAR mechanic in the trunk, Jim is put on the case to find the killer.Episode 5 - Dirty Little Secrets - When a man finds a man killed at a rest stop, Jim and Carlos along with Dr. Perez, an old student of Carlos's, investigate further to see what the cause of death was and who did it.Episode 6 - Gibtown - When a woman's body is found in a baby stroller in an area where the people are descendants of sideshow people, Jim is on the case to find who killed the woman.Episode 7 - Addicted to Love - When a Haitian doctor is found murdered, Jim pieces things together and finds that he was involved in illegal drugs and selling them as well.Episode 8 - Second Skin - When a minister is found dead in a pit of snakes, Jim is forced to go into the world of a religious sect that he knows nothing about to find a killer that could be in the midst of the members.Episode 9 - Iron Pipeline - When a coach is shot, Jim is called in to investigate the murder.Episode 10 - Swamp Thing - When a Coast Guard Marine's finger is found inside a dead boar's stomach, Jim and Carlos go out to find the killer. This results in uncovering something bigger than just a murder as well.Episode 11 - Beached - Jim is called on the scene when a man is found dead on the beach and the owner of a beachside bar is the main suspect.Episode 12 - Shine - An Ernest Hemingway look-alike is found shot in the head and adrift in the ocean.Episode 13 - Breakout - In the Season 2 finale, ex-con brothers seize Callie's hospital and take hostages, and Jim and Callie must work together to capture the men and keep everyone safe.Special features:Family Matters - Extended EpisodeDeleted ScenesJim Longworth's Guide to Police WorkLove Triangles: Relationship Complexities and The GladesGag ReelCommentary on Moonlighting EpisodeSo what makes The Glades a good show? Well, besides the quirkiness I like the fact that the characters can be related to. Colleen is the firm but fair boss, Daniel and Carlos are good and likable partners, Callie is the girl next door, and Jim is putter wielding, wisecracking guy that eventually finds the answer, but has to make several mistakes along the way to the answer. And their lives are not without the occasional bump, whether it be love lives, gone astray prot&eacute;g&eacute;es, or problems with family and friends, we can relate to the way they react to the bumps. Besides, everything is better when you're in the swamp. If you watch The Glades then you'll want to pick up Season 2, and if you've never seen The Glades then go out and get season 1 and 2.

1433887,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004YM6JVO,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Out of nowhere it seems that many cable channels are coming alive with some of the best television shows on the air. I've found myself captivated by shows like WHITE COLLAR, BURN NOTICE and COVERT AFFAIRS while passing over many network shows. The reason is that these shows are smart, well written and entertaining. That holds true with the A&E; series THE GLADES.Season one of THE GLADES introduced us to the main characters, who they were and how they ticked. The show focuses Jim Longworth (Matt Passmore), a Chicago detective who made a mistake and was forced out of town. Longworth now works in a small Florida town for the State Police in their homicide division. His methods are unusual to say the least but his record is tops.Side characters in the series include Carlos Gomez as Carlos Sanchez, the local coroner and friend of Longworth, Michelle Hurd as Colleen Manus the head of the local division and Jordan Wall as Daniel Green, Carlos assistant and resident nerd. But there is an additional main character as well in Callie Cargill (Kiele Sanchez), a local nurse and single mother who finds a mutual attraction to Longworth that begins in season one and continues to develop in season two.While solving a weekly murder is the main focus of the series, the relationship between Jim and Callie is of equal importance. In season one we found out that Callie is still married but that her husband is in prison. She wants to divorce him but has held off until his release. With season two he gets an early release and now Callie must decide what to do: stay with a man who is trying to get his act together or go with Jim. The fact that her son continues to love his father but finds a friend in Jim complicates matters.If that weren't enough there is a problem on Jim's side as well. An ex-colleague from Chicago comes down to help with a case. But this isn't just any ex-colleague. This is a woman that Jim was involved with, not just a partner of the force but in life as well for a time. Will romance rekindle or will Jim wait for Callie to make up her mind about what she wants? These and other personal questions make the series interesting from a different standpoint than the murders he investigates.But the investigations are of interest as well. Jim Longworth is a character who is long on smart aleck quips, sarcasm and the insight to see beneath what lies on the surface. My only misgiving about the character is his willingness to toss out accusations like they hold no meanings and hoping they will stick. It would seem a charge of harassment might stick if one of the accused here considered filing. But that's reality and this is TV. The remarks help him solve the case and we get entertained in the process.The cases are much like season one in that they don't always have the normal type murders that actually exist in the real world. Instead we have a murder in a community where sideshow carnival acts have gone to retire. Or we get into a murder of a NASCAR driver. These are not the typical fare for most murder mystery shows but they all seem to fit into this one.There isn't an actor in this series who doesn't fit their part to a T. Not only that, each and every one excels at the role they play. To pull one front and center as the best would be to do a disservice to the rest. They all are phenomenal. As the main character Passmore does take center stage but he's often more than willing to share that with his co-stars.It seems odd to say this as I read it in print, but this show about murder and crime is actually quite entertaining and funny. But there are moments that touch the heart as well. Give it a view and my guess is you'll find yourself much like I have, watching the series as it airs as well as enjoying the DVDs. This is one series that delivers the goods.",4,DEPTH OF CHARACTER PROGRESS,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,3811,"['nowhere', 'many', 'cable', 'channels', 'are', 'coming', 'alive', 'best', 'television', 'shows', 'air', ""'ve"", 'found', 'captivated', 'shows', 'WHITE', 'COLLAR', 'BURN', 'NOTICE', 'COVERT', 'AFFAIRS', 'passing', 'over', 'many', 'network', 'shows', 'reason', 'shows', 'are', 'smart', 'well', 'written', 'entertaining', 'true', 'A', 'E', 'series', 'THE', 'GLADES.Season', 'one', 'THE', 'GLADES', 'introduced', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'how', 'ticked', 'show', 'Jim', 'Longworth', 'Matt', 'Passmore', 'Chicago', 'detective', 'who', 'made', 'mistake', 'was', 'forced', 'town', 'Longworth', 'now', 'small', 'Florida', 'town', 'State', 'Police', 'homicide', 'division', 'methods', 'are', 'unusual', 'say', 'least', 'record', 'tops.Side', 'characters', 'series', 'include', 'Carlos', 'Gomez', 'Carlos', 'Sanchez', 'local', 'coroner', 'friend', 'Longworth', 'Michelle', 'Hurd', 'Colleen', 'Manus', 'head', 'local', 'division', 'Jordan', 'Wall', 'Daniel', 'Green', 'Carlos', 'assistant', 'resident', 'nerd', 'additional', 'main', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Callie', 'Cargill', 'Kiele', 'Sanchez', 'local', 'nurse', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'Longworth', 'season', 'one', 'develop', 'season', 'two.While', 'solving', 'weekly', 'murder', 'main', 'focus', 'series', 'relationship', 'Jim', 'Callie', 'equal', 'importance', 'season', 'one', 'found', 'out', 'Callie', 'still', 'married', 'husband', 'prison', 'divorce', 'held', 'off', 'release', 'season', 'two', 'early', 'release', 'now', 'Callie', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'stay', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'go', 'Jim', 'fact', 'son', 'love', 'father', 'friend', 'Jim', 'complicates', 'matters.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'problem', 'Jim', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'ex-colleague', 'Chicago', 'down', 'help', 'case', ""n't"", 'just', 'ex-colleague', 'woman', 'Jim', 'was', 'involved', 'not', 'just', 'partner', 'force', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'Will', 'romance', 'rekindle', 'will', 'Jim', 'wait', 'Callie', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'other', 'personal', 'questions', 'make', 'series', 'interesting', 'different', 'standpoint', 'murders', 'investigations', 'are', 'interest', 'well', 'Jim', 'Longworth', 'character', 'who', 'long', 'smart', 'aleck', 'quips', 'sarcasm', 'insight', 'see', 'what', 'surface', 'only', 'misgiving', 'character', 'willingness', 'toss', 'out', 'accusations', 'hold', 'meanings', 'hoping', 'will', 'stick', 'would', 'seem', 'charge', 'harassment', 'might', 'stick', 'one', 'accused', 'here', 'considered', 'filing', 'reality', 'TV', 'remarks', 'help', 'solve', 'case', 'get', 'entertained', 'process.The', 'cases', 'are', 'much', 'season', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'normal', 'type', 'murders', 'actually', 'exist', 'real', 'world', 'Instead', 'have', 'murder', 'community', 'where', 'sideshow', 'carnival', 'acts', 'have', 'gone', 'retire', 'get', 'murder', 'NASCAR', 'driver', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'fare', 'most', 'murder', 'mystery', 'shows', 'seem', 'fit', ""n't"", 'actor', 'series', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'part', 'T.', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'excels', 'role', 'play', 'pull', 'one', 'front', 'center', 'best', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'disservice', 'rest', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'main', 'character', 'Passmore', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'often', 'more', 'willing', 'share', 'co-stars.It', 'odd', 'say', 'read', 'print', 'show', 'murder', 'crime', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'are', 'moments', 'touch', 'heart', 'well', 'Give', 'view', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'find', 'much', 'have', 'watching', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'enjoying', 'DVDs', 'one', 'series', 'goods']",The Glades: Season 2

Many of these shows tie everything up in the beginning and they have their share of jaw dropping dopiness.However, even by the low standards of cop shows, this is pretty dire. The main character is a House-like jerk who is supposedly awesome but takes forever to solve the case. There are the points where actors have to stop and make show-killing speeches.And then there is Kiele Sanchez - an actress that is so horrifying bad that it's a wonder that she's working.
