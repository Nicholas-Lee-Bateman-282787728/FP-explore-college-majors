Seymour Cassel yells and punches his way through a part that needed more hippie sweetness to win me over.  He comes off more like a stalker than a passionate lover--in the end, Gena Rowlands doesn't seem to fall in love so much as cave in.  Maybe it's the moustache--I liked him better when he cut it, too!  The scenes with Cassavetes as her married lover are electrifying and I wanted to see more of him.  This looks like a polished studio picture compared to most Cassavetes films.  It's like he was trying to make a screwball romantic comedy in the Hollywood tradition but couldn't help being his explosive, passionate self.  Still, some touching scenes (Rowlands drinking with her older friend, Cassavetes coming home to the kids) makes it well worth checking out.",3,Love on the Rocks,1037750400,"11 20, 2002",2002,833,"['love', 'Cassavetes', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'one', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'yells', 'punches', 'way', 'part', 'needed', 'more', 'hippie', 'sweetness', 'win', 'off', 'more', 'stalker', 'passionate', 'lover', 'end', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fall', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'cave', 'Maybe', 'moustache', 'liked', 'better', 'when', 'cut', 'too', 'scenes', 'Cassavetes', 'married', 'lover', 'are', 'electrifying', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'polished', 'studio', 'picture', 'compared', 'most', 'Cassavetes', 'films', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'screwball', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Hollywood', 'tradition', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'explosive', 'passionate', 'self', 'Still', 'touching', 'scenes', 'Rowlands', 'drinking', 'older', 'friend', 'Cassavetes', 'coming', 'home', 'kids', 'well', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

Well, putting aside the manifest fallacy that any art can be `truth', even were one to accept that premise, this film is a walking, talking testament for the need of a little judicious fibbing, every so often, to up the art quotient. Yes, the realism of certain humorous scenes is way above the typical Hollywood screwball domestic comedies of earlier times, but Cassavetes ruins their power by never relenting, never letting a mature nor subtle dramatic moment exist between the two leads. There is no vulnerability shown, no moderation brinked, and thus Moskowitz comes across as a dislikable, if not despicable, person, and one that, in a truly `truthful' film, someone like Minnie Moore would not waste a minute of her life on, much less a doomed marriage. And you just know that the `marriage' of these two characters will last no longer than the film they're in, but Cassavetes accepts it and wants you too, as well. Fine, but acceptance is not caring, and without a character to care for, or empathize with, few films can succeed.Even though the clothes and sayings are pass&eacute;, that is not the reason this film has not aged well. When it was made, all independent films were thought to have that rough, shoestring budget quality, and it seemed a virtue, of sorts, but too much has changed. Indy filmmakers like John Sayles and David Gordon Green have shown that a low budget does not automatically equal a low quality film, so this film simply looks cheap, silly, dated, and amateurish in all technical aspects, but especially so in the writing, where loose ends hang all over the place. My wife told me, when it was over, that she felt like she was waiting for a punchline that never came, and it's true, for Minnie And Moskowitz is not really a single film, but more like a series of brilliant and horrible vignettes, or blackout sketches, that never quite connect up into a coherent whole to be enjoyed. Had the film recapitulated that feeling into the romance it might have been something wonderful. As it is, it is merely a noble, but head-scratching, failure.",3,Ok,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,2151,"['often', 'said', 'boosters', 'Cassavetes', 'films', 'are', 'truth', 'Well', 'putting', 'aside', 'manifest', 'fallacy', 'art', 'can', 'be', 'truth', 'even', 'were', 'one', 'accept', 'premise', 'film', 'walking', 'talking', 'testament', 'need', 'little', 'judicious', 'fibbing', 'so', 'often', 'up', 'art', 'quotient', 'Yes', 'realism', 'certain', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'way', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'screwball', 'domestic', 'comedies', 'earlier', 'times', 'Cassavetes', 'power', 'never', 'relenting', 'never', 'letting', 'mature', 'subtle', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'exist', 'two', 'leads', 'vulnerability', 'shown', 'moderation', 'brinked', 'thus', 'Moskowitz', 'across', 'dislikable', 'not', 'despicable', 'person', 'one', 'truly', 'truthful', 'film', 'someone', 'Minnie', 'Moore', 'would', 'not', 'waste', 'minute', 'life', 'much', 'less', 'doomed', 'marriage', 'just', 'know', 'marriage', 'two', 'characters', 'will', 'last', 'no', 'longer', 'film', ""'re"", 'accepts', 'too', 'as', 'well', 'Fine', 'acceptance', 'not', 'caring', 'character', 'care', 'empathize', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'succeed.Even', 'clothes', 'sayings', 'are', 'pass', 'eacute', 'not', 'reason', 'film', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'When', 'was', 'made', 'independent', 'films', 'were', 'thought', 'have', 'rough', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'quality', 'seemed', 'virtue', 'sorts', 'too', 'much', 'changed', 'Indy', 'filmmakers', 'John', 'Sayles', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'have', 'shown', 'low', 'budget', 'not', 'automatically', 'equal', 'low', 'quality', 'film', 'film', 'simply', 'cheap', 'silly', 'dated', 'amateurish', 'technical', 'aspects', 'especially', 'so', 'writing', 'where', 'loose', 'ends', 'hang', 'place', 'wife', 'told', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'felt', 'was', 'waiting', 'punchline', 'never', 'came', 'true', 'Minnie', 'Moskowitz', 'not', 'really', 'single', 'film', 'more', 'series', 'brilliant', 'horrible', 'vignettes', 'blackout', 'sketches', 'never', 'quite', 'connect', 'up', 'coherent', 'whole', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'Had', 'film', 'recapitulated', 'feeling', 'romance', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'wonderful', 'merely', 'noble', 'head-scratching', 'failure']",N/A

The only thing missing is the shaky camerawork. This isn't a movie.....it's an embarrassment. What's it about? Just imagine a day in the life with some loud mouthed couple who are mismatched and thrown together and someone is following them around with a camcorder waiting for them to kill each other. The only difference is that in this movie they don't die which is a shame considering all the punishment we are subjected to trying to watch it. An eccentric concoction based on a pot brainstorm that isn't worthy of a passing grade in a high school film project assignment. Maybe one of the worse movies I've ever seen.

476713,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,6305759332,Richard J. Brzostek,"[5, 5]","Minnie and Moskowitz is an unusual love story that has a very unique feeling to it right from the start.  Minnie Moore is a pretty blond woman that works in a museum.  Seymour Moskowitz is a parking lot attendant that is a bit of a goofball.  Seymour's chance encounter with Minnie is love at first sight, but now he has to convince her to feel the same.  Minnie is romantic at heart, but isn't sure if she believes in love so Seymour has quite a challenge.If the romance between Seymour and Minnie could be compared to the sound of violin music, it would be the type that hurts your ears.  They have a very rocky romance that is one roller coaster of a ride.  It doesn't help that their personas clash a bit.  Minnie has a sophisticated presence while Seymour may be headstrong; he isn't as polished as her.Nearly all the characters are odd, but in a captivating way.  You wouldn't think of anyone in the movie as really being crazy, but they certainly are unusual.  Part of what gives the movie its magical feeling is the conversations these people have, which border on the philosophical side.The emotion and drama that is part of this story may put off some viewers.  There is a lot of yelling by a lot of the people in this film.  What may repulse viewers even more is the violence.  Minnie takes and gives some hits in her relationships.  It is all part of the story, but may get on your nerves too.  Despite this, everything ties together well at the end and finishes in a way that I enjoyed.  The final message is one of hope and it makes the crazy ride all worthwhile.",5,an unusual love story that has a very unique feeling to it,1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,1577,"['Minnie', 'Moskowitz', 'unusual', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'unique', 'feeling', 'right', 'start', 'Minnie', 'Moore', 'pretty', 'blond', 'woman', 'museum', 'Seymour', 'Moskowitz', 'parking', 'lot', 'attendant', 'bit', 'goofball', 'Seymour', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Minnie', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'now', 'convince', 'feel', 'same', 'Minnie', 'romantic', 'heart', ""n't"", 'sure', 'love', 'so', 'Seymour', 'quite', 'challenge.If', 'romance', 'Seymour', 'Minnie', 'could', 'be', 'compared', 'sound', 'violin', 'music', 'would', 'be', 'type', 'ears', 'have', 'very', 'rocky', 'romance', 'one', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', ""n't"", 'help', 'personas', 'bit', 'Minnie', 'sophisticated', 'presence', 'Seymour', 'may', 'be', 'headstrong', ""n't"", 'as', 'polished', 'her.Nearly', 'characters', 'are', 'odd', 'captivating', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'movie', 'really', 'being', 'crazy', 'certainly', 'are', 'unusual', 'Part', 'what', 'movie', 'magical', 'feeling', 'conversations', 'people', 'have', 'border', 'philosophical', 'side.The', 'emotion', 'drama', 'part', 'story', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'viewers', 'lot', 'yelling', 'lot', 'people', 'film', 'What', 'may', 'repulse', 'viewers', 'even', 'more', 'violence', 'Minnie', 'hits', 'relationships', 'part', 'story', 'may', 'get', 'nerves', 'too', 'everything', 'ties', 'together', 'well', 'end', 'finishes', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'final', 'message', 'one', 'hope', 'crazy', 'ride', 'worthwhile']",N/A
