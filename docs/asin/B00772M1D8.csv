Usually, I don't care for the switching scenes in movies but, this time it was very necessary to get the story etched in your mind. James Cromwell was the grandfather and his acting was outstanding as was his 13 year old grandson played by Jackson Bond. Grandson becomes insistent that his Grand father tell him some stories of items that were in Grand Fathers foot locker. It happened and they switched between the grand son at age 13 and when he was in Iraq in the hospital and was played by Jonathan Bennett.

1527083,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B00772M1D8,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[3, 4]","I get a little uncomfortable when they say that our military are sent to fight for our freedoms, whatever that means. So, when I first read this film's title -- ""Memorial Day"" --, I immediately thought that this was going to be one of these silly patriotic movies with no redeeming values - a brainwashing, propaganda experience, if you will. But how mistaken I was! ""Memorial Day"" is a very smart, touching and honest film about love and family, and how the military experience affect or lives.The movie basically opens on Le Center, Minnesota, on Memorial Day, 1993. It is a hot, beautiful day, and we find Bud Vogel (James Cromwell), seating in the porch of his home, keeping an eye on his grandchildren, who were playing outside. At one point in time, the children are playing hide and seek, and young Kyle Vogel, one of Bud's grandsons, finds a trunk inside a barn house. He opens it, and discovers old memorabilia from his grandfather's military service during World War II. He is curious and, against his grandmother Betty's (Mary Kay Fortier-Spalding) advice, takes the trunk to his grandfather. Betty believes that showing it to Bud will bring bad memories. Initially, Bud is aggravated, but he consents to talk about the stuff inside the trunk with Kyle. However, as to not expand his grief, Bud only agrees to talk about three items. Kyle agrees, and proceeds to select the items, with Bud telling him stories about each one. For this purpose, we are taken to the war itself, when young Bud (then Lieutenant Bud Vogel, played by John Cromwell) was guiding his troops in Holland, Belgium and Germany. At the same time, we are transported to Iraq, in 2001, and we see SSGT Kyle Vogel (Jonathan Bennett) commanding his troops in war. He gets wounded, and ends up in a military hospital, were he talks to Dr. Kelly Tripp (Emily Fradenburgh) about that special Memorial Day on 1993.Directed by Sam Fischer, ""Memorial Day"" is truly an unforgettable experience, and I am very happy to have watched it. It is not patronizing and it doesn't take political sides. It goes right to your heart, and it makes you appreciate life more. You will learn, too, as Bud tells Kyle, that ""we are different from other animals because we can do one thing they can't: we can kill at a distance."" And I have to say that I never get tired of watching James Cromwell acting - he has great presence. I also enjoyed Mary Kay Fortier-Spalding; she was very tender and understanding of her husband. Great movie. The Blu-ray includes audio commentary by Fischer, John Cromwell, and writer Marc Conklin, as well as a making-of feature.

Either that or they shove patriotism down your throat. ""Memorial Day"" isn't like that at all, which is a relief. What really balances out the entire movie is the time Kyle spends with his grandfather. James Cromwell's heartfelt performance is really fantastic. His emotion gives much needed heart to a story like this. The thing about grandfathers is that they're supposed to always have a story to tell and have words of wisdom. Bud is the epitome of that, but he waits to reveal that until somebody makes him talk.The time Kyle and Bud spend together inspires Kyle to start a collection of his own once he becomes a soldier as an adult and has a family of his own. This is the other big intriguing aspect of the war drama. Seeing Kyle collect things throughout the movie only makes you realize what he's eventually going to tell his son one day, which is kind of heartwarming. The last five minutes of the movie are also its bread and butter. It's as if the entire movie was written to give those few scenes more impact and it works so well. It's just a series of really passionate performances along with perhaps the most memorable scene to take place on that porch in the entire movie.Many of the other performances feel uninspired. Maybe it's just the way Hollywood writes soldiers, but most of them are pretty forgettable here other than Kyle. John Cromwell is pretty exceptional in his full length feature film debut though. Everyone else outside of the main cast just feels like filler. Ho-hum is an acceptable way to describe the majority of the movie as things like the score, battlefield sequences, and lines of dialogue will be a distant memory at best. Although roaming shots of the countryside are extremely colorful on the Blu-ray edition of the movie.""Memorial Day"" is mostly watchable thanks to the performances of John and James Cromwell. The story does its best to reel you in and feel for these characters, but may feel like it's stringing you along with no pay off in sight at times. There are certainly worse war related movies you could spend your hard earned money on.Special features include Audio Commentary with Director Sam Fischer, Writer Marc Conklin, and Actor John Cromwell and a less than two minute Behind the Scenes featurette.""Memorial Day"" is being released as a single disc DVD and a single disc Blu-ray starting tomorrow, May 29. The movie is not rated, is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio in 1080p High-Definition and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. It is approximately 104 minutes in length.

It's beginnings came after the American Civil War to commemorate the fallen Union soldiers of the Civil War. Southern ladies also decorated Confederate graves in Richmond and other important Civil War cities.Today, the holiday encompasses all wars.The film Memorial Day brings the holiday to vivid life when 13-year-old Kyle discovers his grandfather's trunk while playing hide-and-seek. At first the grandfather, Bud, (James Cromwell) tells the youngster to put it back. But eventually decides to make a puzzle out of the trunk and the holiday. He tells Kyle to pick any three items out of the box and he'll tell the story behind the souvenir.The film also flashes forward to show Kyle, now a soldier himself, in the Iraq war, injured and being questioned by a nurse about his own experiences.Bud, a WWII soldier, shares decisions he made, some good, some bad -- but emphasized you just got to make them and live with them. Clearly as he remembers we realize what a difficult task it is to choose these verdicts.Years later Kyle will remember his grandfather's choices, and find he can make his determinations a little more informed. He also comes to understand war is war.Many times veterans have a hard time talking about their experiences. I think Memorial Day would certainly be a good starting point.

1527127,AU7MW8YQQYHXX,B00772M1D8,"John A. Van Devender ""Gadfly""","[1, 1]","I spent 23 years in the military during a time (Viet Nam) when the wider culture was definitely not disposed to endorsing that lifestyle.  This movie demonstrates that finally it is possible for our stories to be told without the false romanticism of the early days nor the hideous distortions of the Anti-war crowd.When a military person talks about ""doing his job"" there is an entire layer of meaning that is included there that simply does not communicate very well outside the circle.  He/She is not talking about simply putting in time at the desk nor just earning a paycheck.  That person is talking about an entire focus of life and mission that integrates sense of country, sense of responsibility, sense of mutual dependence, sense of honor, sense of necessity that transcends ordinary vocation.  This is not to romanticize it nor to unduly glorify it.  It simply is what it has to be.  The well understood observation that when the bullets are flying that a soldier is not fighting for his country, he is fighting for his buddies, is true.  But the reason why he is fighting for them is because, fundamentally, they share that same set of sensibilities, each to a greater or lesser extent and each in different proportions.  Life is clarified greatly when your immediate actions and those of your brothers in arms constitute issues of life and death.  The simultaneously liberating and depressing reality that death is only one bullet away at any given instant and that there really is no such thing as a ""safe area"" breeds a certain callousness as well as intense awareness of each moment.  There is the story of the soldier crossing Flanders field in World War I, in the midst of mind boggling carnage, suddenly being intensely aware of a single tree still standing and beautifully shrouded in fog.  Life is real when your business is death.This of course does not mean, necessarily, that this intensity of experience is always conducive to mental stability.  There are those of us in whom sensory over-load simply is intolerable and the danger of foundational collapse is a real possibility.  That challenge is always present and as this movie shows, each person responds to it in their own unique manner.I have seen few movies which rivets the audiences attention to the military experience as well as this one.  There are no rose colored glasses here but neither are honor and duty held in contempt.  The central character hates the statement ""it is what it is"" but in the last analysis, that is the message that the story communicates.  The connection between the grandson and the grandfather is far more than common military experience but it cannot be separated from it.  Their stories are different but fundamentally the same.  As the grandfather says... ""you cannot choose your war... you have to just go and do the best job you can.""  That statement communicates the fundamental integrity and prevailing moral virtue of military service.  A price has to be paid... but the whole point is that is a price that must be paid.  Not everyone is called to it and not everyone can do it... and that also is just how it is.  But for those who do and for those whose integrity is proven in it, there is a transcendent bond that is established among them that is as important as life itself.  It simple is the way it is.What is possible to achieve is exactly what this movie portrays as being achieved, both by the grandfather and his grandson.  The respect and appreciation of superiors and inferiors alike, when the man they want to fight with is the man that is there with them.  Grandfather and grandson both walked the walk and their reward was not a grand parade and a bunch of medals.  Their reward was the look in their fellow soldiers' eyes when tough decisions had to be made.Some will say that such is not worth it... they are the ones who don't know what it means to ""do their job.""This is a great movie and it is well worth watching.",5,Doing the Job That Has To Be Done,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,3957,"['spent', '23', 'years', 'military', 'time', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'when', 'wider', 'culture', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'disposed', 'endorsing', 'lifestyle', 'movie', 'finally', 'possible', 'stories', 'be', 'told', 'false', 'romanticism', 'early', 'days', 'hideous', 'distortions', 'Anti-war', 'crowd.When', 'military', 'person', 'talks', 'doing', 'job', 'entire', 'layer', 'meaning', 'included', 'simply', 'not', 'communicate', 'very', 'well', 'circle', 'He/She', 'not', 'talking', 'simply', 'putting', 'time', 'desk', 'just', 'earning', 'paycheck', 'person', 'talking', 'entire', 'focus', 'life', 'mission', 'sense', 'country', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'sense', 'mutual', 'dependence', 'sense', 'honor', 'sense', 'necessity', 'ordinary', 'vocation', 'not', 'romanticize', 'unduly', 'glorify', 'simply', 'what', 'be', 'well', 'understood', 'observation', 'when', 'bullets', 'are', 'flying', 'soldier', 'not', 'fighting', 'country', 'fighting', 'buddies', 'true', 'reason', 'why', 'fighting', 'because', 'fundamentally', 'share', 'same', 'set', 'sensibilities', 'greater', 'lesser', 'extent', 'different', 'proportions', 'Life', 'clarified', 'greatly', 'when', 'immediate', 'actions', 'brothers', 'arms', 'constitute', 'issues', 'life', 'death', 'simultaneously', 'liberating', 'depressing', 'reality', 'death', 'only', 'one', 'bullet', 'away', 'given', 'instant', 'really', 'such', 'thing', 'safe', 'area', 'certain', 'callousness', 'as', 'well', 'intense', 'awareness', 'moment', 'story', 'soldier', 'crossing', 'Flanders', 'field', 'World', 'War', 'midst', 'mind', 'boggling', 'carnage', 'suddenly', 'being', 'intensely', 'aware', 'single', 'tree', 'still', 'standing', 'beautifully', 'shrouded', 'fog', 'Life', 'real', 'when', 'business', 'death.This', 'course', 'not', 'mean', 'necessarily', 'intensity', 'experience', 'always', 'conducive', 'mental', 'stability', 'are', 'whom', 'sensory', 'over-load', 'simply', 'intolerable', 'danger', 'foundational', 'collapse', 'real', 'possibility', 'challenge', 'always', 'present', 'movie', 'person', 'own', 'unique', 'manner.I', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'movies', 'rivets', 'audiences', 'attention', 'military', 'experience', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'are', 'rose', 'colored', 'glasses', 'here', 'are', 'honor', 'duty', 'held', 'contempt', 'central', 'character', 'statement', 'what', 'last', 'analysis', 'message', 'story', 'communicates', 'connection', 'grandson', 'grandfather', 'far', 'more', 'common', 'military', 'experience', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'separated', 'stories', 'are', 'different', 'fundamentally', 'same', 'grandfather', 'can', 'not', 'choose', 'war', 'have', 'just', 'go', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'can', 'statement', 'fundamental', 'integrity', 'prevailing', 'moral', 'virtue', 'military', 'service', 'price', 'be', 'paid', 'whole', 'point', 'price', 'must', 'be', 'paid', 'Not', 'everyone', 'called', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'do', 'also', 'just', 'how', 'who', 'do', 'integrity', 'proven', 'transcendent', 'bond', 'established', 'as', 'important', 'life', 'simple', 'way', 'possible', 'achieve', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'being', 'achieved', 'grandfather', 'grandson', 'respect', 'appreciation', 'superiors', 'inferiors', 'alike', 'when', 'man', 'want', 'fight', 'man', 'there', 'Grandfather', 'grandson', 'walked', 'walk', 'reward', 'was', 'not', 'grand', 'parade', 'bunch', 'medals', 'reward', 'was', 'look', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'eyes', 'when', 'tough', 'decisions', 'had', 'be', 'made.Some', 'will', 'say', 'such', 'not', 'worth', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'job', 'great', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Memorial Day

1527134,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00772M1D8,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I found this film watchable and by moments even quite good - but ultimately I felt a little bit disappointed. Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.Sergeant Kyle Vogel (Jonathan Bennett) is a young American soldier who serves in Iraq with the 34th Infantry Division. Briefly hospitalised for a not very serious injury, he strikes up a conversation with the resident military psychiatrist, Lieutenant Kelly Tripp (Emily Fradenburgh). Even if he is of course aware that this conversation is neither entirely accidental nor completely casual he accepts to play the game and tells to the the inifinitely patient psychiatrist a story from his childhood, about the one and only day when his grandfather (James Cromwell) accepted to tell him some of his own service with 82nd Airborne Division in WWII. The film then mixes four  story lines: Kyle's service in Iraq, Kyle's conversation with Lt. Tripp, Kyle's conversation with his grandfather and the WWII stories his grandfather tells him...This is a rather well done film, but it is not entirely succesfull. Quite a lot of what we hear and see is quite clich&eacute;d and banal and ultimately seems... quite flat. War time adventures of both men are not very interesting - we saw ALL OF THIS like hundreds of times. In fact the really interesting parts of this film, those which I liked the best are the moments when we see the grandfather struggling with his progressing sickness and slowly overwhelming dementia, brief but clever exchanges between Kyle and Lt. Tripp and especially the very ending which is a kind of post-scriptum of the whole story...In war time fragments only some elements were really good and original, like a brief scene in which we can see in April 1945 a veteran Waffen SS officer fighting against the Americans side by side with his young son who can't be older that 14... There is also one soldier in Kyle's squad who is a really peculiar and highly entertaining fellow. Fighting scenes are not really good and there is few of them anyway - I admit however that there is one scene of a suicide bomber attack in Iraq which is very honest indeed... Finally, there is a grand total of three good one-liners - not enough to carry the film, but still it is better than in many recent works...The most precious thing in this film is its respectful and grateful tone, as ""Memorial Day"" was clearly made as a tribute to all US soldiers who since 1941 served their country and fought bravely, risking loss of life or limb against really horrible regimes and cruel foes...

I served proudly with Delta Co. 2nd Bat 8th Cav Rgt Abn 1st Air Cavalry Division in Vietnam in 68/69.  I was wounded for my third and final time on Jan 28th 1969 and spent two years recovering at Walson Army Hospital at Ft. Dix, NJ.  I was like I came full circle, Ft. Dix is where I started and it's where I ended upon my discharge date which was also my release date from the hospital.  I was very emotionally connected to this movie since every male in my family served in a war or the service at one time.  That includes my namesake Uncle Nick who was killed in Germany and who is buried in Holland.  My dad who was with the 440th Combat Engieneers and Uncle Nick was with Patton in the 2nd Armour Div as Armored Infantry and like me was also an Infantry Sergeant.  Dad and Uncle Nick spent leave time together for the last time just before D-Day in England and then both headed off to France.  I am so glad that a bunch of Americans have adotped my Uncle's burial plot and have paid for the maintainance and upkeep of it and have posted it on the internet.  I found it there accidentially one day and all his military info.  The only things I have to remind me of him is a last photo of he and my dad in England and a photo of his white cross that my dad took after the German's surrendered.  I tried many times to talk to my dad about his combat time but he never would open up about it or even any of his military time. He was a great dad and I loved my parents dearly but they are both gone now.  The only time he taled to me about it was when I got back from Vietnam and then he pulled out an old dufflebag and pulled out his uniforms and WWII awards, that was the first and only times that we ever talked about it.  That's why this movie meant so much to me and why I think it was so realistic.  Boy, I wish they had spellcheck on Amazon!!!  Well, anyways, I felt compelled to put my opinion in and hope it is accepted by others who are thinking about buying this movie.  For those of you who think I am a phony or wannabe, just Google my name or buy the book, ""Strength and Honor"" by my dear friend Terry Garlock in Peachtree, GA, it too is available here on Amazon.  He saw fit to write my story along with a lot of my friends and others whom he picked to write about.  Thank you for listening.

1527139,A2PX1Q29F2VYFG,B00772M1D8,noname,"[2, 12]","I rented this movie because the 4- and 5-star ratings outnumbered the 1-star ratings by a ratio of 20-1 (201 to 10). I agree *completely* with all ten of my predecessors' 1-star ratings.Aside from the Cromwells, the acting is miserably bad. The storyline is more predictable than a Mighty Mouse cartoon and the entire ""interplay"" between the nurse and patient is acted so badly it not only *feels* contrived, it almost comes off as being read from cue cards.Fortunately, I like James Cromwell, and just enough to sit through this travesty to enjoy his performance. Unfortunately, I had to grind through Jonathan Bennett and that nurse. He should stick to the lightweight-movie roles for which he's ""known"".This movie almost set a record for the number of times I looked at my watch. Everyone touting this movie makes claims for heart-felt this and that... BS. Without James Cromwell, I'd wager most of the audience would vanish... Bennett scenes ground time to a crawl. The most touching scene had nothing to do with the scars of war and memories of military service, nor anything related to the movie title. That ""most touching"" scene was performed when Cromwell thanked his wife for his last lemonade--again, the emotional strength and impact of the big screen was only wielded by Cromwell's talent.If you're suckered into watching this garbage despite having read these reviews, ask yourself one question while you're viewing the movie--""do I care what happens to this character?"" It'll tell you if you think there's any viable performance by the subject you're watching. I'll bet your answer is, ""no""... and if it is, skip the rest of the movie. Nothing happens that you didn't anticipate, and everything you'd predict comes to pass. There's a reason the IMDB rating for this movie was 5.6--I wish I'd seen their rating before renting this movie. Without the pre-29yr old female vote, the IMDB number would have been remarkably lower.If you feel the need to watch a well-acted, or patriotic, or heart-felt, or handkerchief movie about how vets feel when they come home from war, do yourself a BIG favor--skip this and rent ""Coming Home"" or ""Born On the Fourth of July"".Zardoz, make room; you've got company.",1,suckered by preceding reviews,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2211,"['rented', 'movie', '4-', '5-star', 'ratings', 'outnumbered', '1-star', 'ratings', 'ratio', '20-1', '201', '10', 'agree', '*completely*', 'ten', 'predecessors', '1-star', 'ratings.Aside', 'Cromwells', 'acting', 'miserably', 'bad', 'storyline', 'more', 'predictable', 'Mighty', 'Mouse', 'cartoon', 'entire', 'interplay', 'nurse', 'patient', 'acted', 'so', 'badly', 'not', 'only', 'contrived', 'almost', 'off', 'being', 'read', 'cue', 'cards.Fortunately', 'like', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'just', 'enough', 'sit', 'travesty', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'grind', 'Jonathan', 'Bennett', 'nurse', 'should', 'stick', 'lightweight-movie', 'roles', 'known', '.This', 'movie', 'almost', 'set', 'record', 'number', 'times', 'looked', 'watch', 'Everyone', 'touting', 'movie', 'claims', 'heart-felt', 'BS', 'James', 'Cromwell', ""'d"", 'wager', 'most', 'audience', 'would', 'vanish', 'Bennett', 'scenes', 'ground', 'time', 'crawl', 'most', 'touching', 'scene', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'scars', 'war', 'memories', 'military', 'service', 'anything', 'related', 'movie', 'title', 'most', 'touching', 'scene', 'was', 'performed', 'when', 'Cromwell', 'thanked', 'wife', 'last', 'lemonade', 'again', 'emotional', 'strength', 'impact', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'only', 'wielded', 'Cromwell', 'talent.If', ""'re"", 'suckered', 'watching', 'garbage', 'having', 'read', 'reviews', 'ask', 'one', 'question', ""'re"", 'viewing', 'movie', 'do', 'care', 'what', 'character', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'think', 'viable', 'performance', 'subject', ""'re"", 'watching', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'answer', 'skip', 'rest', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'did', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'everything', ""'d"", 'predict', 'pass', 'reason', 'IMDB', 'rating', 'movie', 'was', '5.6', 'wish', ""'d"", 'seen', 'rating', 'renting', 'movie', 'pre-29yr', 'old', 'female', 'vote', 'IMDB', 'number', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'remarkably', 'lower.If', 'feel', 'need', 'watch', 'well-acted', 'patriotic', 'heart-felt', 'handkerchief', 'movie', 'how', 'vets', 'feel', 'when', 'come', 'home', 'war', 'do', 'BIG', 'favor', 'skip', 'rent', 'Coming', 'Home', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', '.Zardoz', 'make', 'room', ""'ve"", 'got', 'company']",Memorial Day

Bud has been trying to put the past memories of his time during WW 2 behind him, then on Memorial Day in 1993, his grandson Kyle finds his old footlocker and brings it to his Grandpa. At first he is none too pleased and when he tells Kyle to put it back, Kyle answers `but what am I supposed to remember?' So he decides to tell the story of some of the objects or souvenirs in the box.We also have a the parallel story of Kyle after he has joined the US Army and is on a tour of duty in Iraq circa 2005, where he is recounting  his memories of that time to a lieutenant doctor. Both his life and the stories of his grandpa are told in flash back.Military purists are going to find fault with the WW 2 depictions, especially as the budget did not stretch to a cast of thousands but the Iraq era action is actually very well done. This is not an action movie in any way at all so please avoid if that is what you are looking for.

What can I say, was born in 60 and reckon it isn't to dissimilar from those born in 90 or 2000. Grew up seeing ""the war"" nightly on tv and by the time I was a teenager the war was over. I've never served although I spent many a sleepless night during the year my youngest was in Afghanistan. Governments are screwed up and most wars are truly fought for the wrong reasons, however this should never diminish the respect and care we give to our veterans and active troops. This flick was one that is worthy for all of us that live free because they protected us. Reminds us of burden they carry. Sit back, grab a beer and think of those you know that have served. Thank you - to all our troops.",4,Worth watching.,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,823,"['Not', 'bad', 'flick', 'Excellent', 'topic', 'Alot', 'critics', 'acting', 'actually', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'be', 'hypercritical', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'born', '60', 'reckon', ""n't"", 'dissimilar', 'born', '90', '2000', 'Grew', 'up', 'seeing', 'war', 'nightly', 'tv', 'time', 'was', 'teenager', 'war', 'was', ""'ve"", 'never', 'served', 'spent', 'many', 'sleepless', 'night', 'year', 'youngest', 'was', 'Afghanistan', 'Governments', 'are', 'screwed', 'up', 'most', 'wars', 'are', 'truly', 'fought', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'however', 'should', 'never', 'diminish', 'respect', 'care', 'give', 'veterans', 'active', 'troops', 'flick', 'was', 'one', 'worthy', 'live', 'free', 'protected', 'burden', 'carry', 'Sit', 'back', 'grab', 'beer', 'think', 'know', 'have', 'served', 'Thank', 'troops']",Memorial Day
