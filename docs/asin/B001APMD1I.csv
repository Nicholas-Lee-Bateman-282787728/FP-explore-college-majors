As the program evolved, sex and innuendo became the overwhelming theme of the show.

You have to have seen them to note the oddities.  I won't dwell on them because it would take a long description to break down even one show.  Suffice it to say, if you are a parttime fan of the show, get the earlier years, say 2-7.  If you're a big fan that wants it all, then go ahead and ante up.

If anything changes, get ready for cries of ""you jumped the shark!"" Whatever. Better tell Bud and Kelly to stop getting older then, but if you do, then you lose the opportunity for countless great stories. Such as: Bud's new job at the DMV, Kelly auditioning for a TV show while battling a pimple, Bud staffing the virgin hotline, Kelly going after a commercial, and Bud volunteering for a virtual reality sex experiment.Then there's Al.. the older he gets, the more cynical he gets, the funnier he gets. This season's highlights: being forced to sleep with Marcy, pleading with Bud to pass him on his driver's test, breaking into  Wrigley Field with No Ma'am, banning breast feeding in the shoe store, suing the mall for on-the-job stress, and making a movie about shoes with Kelly. Oh, and they FINALLY included a few bloopers and extras, but only as part of the 200th episode celebration. You can hear a little ""love and marriage"" music in that episode. (I really miss hearing that song when the fountain goes up in the intro!)So, if this is jumping the shark, well, all shows should do it.

1166615,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B001APMD1I,JGC,"[42, 47]","""Married ... with Children"" is the longest running family sitcom in the entire history of episodic television. When the series premiered some 21 years ago on some obscure TV station called Fox no one thought that it would ever morph into this huge worldwide hit.The Star of the series is Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill.) Al is the perpetual, typical husband who just can't catch a break no matter how hard he tries. Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal) is Al's love-starved wife. Peggy is just as horny as she is lazy. The woman has a serious aversion to work and enjoys passing her time smoking on the couch, watching Oprah and eating bonbons. Bud Bundy (David Faustino) is Al and Peg's son. Bud is totally the most intelligent person in this family, however he often gets sidetracked if there's a hot chick involved. Kelly (Christina Applegate) is the daughter of the family and such a sweet girl. Kelly has lofty dreams of being a model but first she'll need to master the art of turning the doorknob. Al can often be seen defending his daughter's honor because he wouldn't ever allow anyone to take advantage of his little ""Pumpkin."" As a matter of fact, even though he'd never admit it, Al is just as protective over both Peggy and Bud, too. Rounding out this very interesting group of people is Marcy D'Arcy (you gotta love that name) (Amanda Bearse) and Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley) the Bundys' neighbors. Marcy and Al have a very serious hatred for each other. I think this is because both are threatened by each other; Al is a man who isn't afraid to say what he wants and vice versa. Jefferson is Marcy's pretty boy second hubby. He's basically the male version of Peggy.The reason why I love this series so much is because it never pretended to be anything than what it was. It never preached to the audience. It never put on airs. No one tried to ""educate"" the viewers. No one tried to give a ""moral"" to the story. And most of all the reason why I consider ""Married... with Children"" to be the defining sitcom of the 80's (and the 90's) is because it never tried to end each show with a ""happy ending."" Nope. They were miserable and they were staying miserable. Although, sometimes I bet Bud would have welcomed a ""happy ending.""There are a total of 27 eps from Season 9 (as well as 1 special.) That's another reason why I loved this show because they often produced in excess of the standard 22 eps per Season. Season 9 is just as good as all of the others and my favorite show from this Season is ""Kelly Takes a Shot.""

Instead they showed families as they really were. But more than that ""Married ... with Children"" celebrated this and embraced this. They never tried to improve upon the Bundy's. Sure, over the course of 11 Seasons they'd change and evolve (after all, even a pack of wild dogs will change) but this wasn't that typical systematic television evolution nonsense that (for some reason) was/is always intent on building people up and showing the sunny-side of life.This is also the first American coast-to-coast program to use such strong language and adult themes and storylines. Of course today it may seem almost tame in the potluck of reality TV hell that domestic television has retrogressed into. (I can only imagine what Al would have to say about this latest batch of reality-garbage that's strewn all over the networks.) It may be hard to believe, but nearly 20 years ago, some of the things discussed on ""Married ... with Children"" were never discussed before.All of the performers were perfect. This is because, like the series, they never took themselves or their roles too seriously. I'm sure Christina and David aren't Shakespearian trained but that's OK and they're probably better off for it. Ed never won an Emmy (he was never even nominated) the series was never in the Top 10 and perhaps overshadowed by those 2 other ""groundbreaking"" family sitcoms of the 80's/90's (you know which ones,) the writers never even received the acclaim that they very rightfully deserved.As a matter of fact, some people were even outraged by the Bundy's. When the show premiered Fox was bombarded with letters and phone calls from angry parents demanding that they pull the plug on this show. For most of the run they had to battle the network and the mindless haters who were afraid of someone corrupting their kids' minds (I suppose the thought of simply changing the channel never occurred?)But all of this really doesn't matter though. Because ""Married ... with Children"" has turned into a huge worldwide phenomenon. The series has been dubbed in more than 75 different languages (everything from German to Japanese to Italian to Indian.) The viewers recognized that this was a fine show and they were the ones who embraced ""Married ... with Children"" because there was never anything like it, before or since. The fans will never forget about this modern classic.This was also a sitcom written from a man's perspective. How many other sitcoms are there like this? (I count zip.) And, in the 80's when everyone was turning all PC, this series stuck out like a smashed thumb. There have always been billions of shows from the women's prospective (I'm so sick of hearing otherwise.) But ""Married...with Children"" didn't conform to the norm. They didn't follow all of the other mindless sheep to that greener pasture. They set their own rules and on this show, father may not have always knew best, but he got his opportunity to be heard.",5,it's a man's world,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,6201,"['Married',

J Rey,"[3, 5]","Constantly downtrodden shoe salesman Al Bundy and his dysfunctional family continue to delivers big laughs in ""Married... with Children: The Complete Ninth Season"". ""Married... with Children"" is the long-running FOX sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In this season, Al and his NO MA'AM crew head to Washington DC to protest the cancellation of their favorite show ""Psycho Dad"". A series of train accidents delays Peg's (Katey Sagal) return home. A huge zit could ruin Kelly's (Christina Applegate) chances to star in a commercial. Bud (David Faustino) volunteers on a Virgin hotline but has problems fulfilling his duties. On a Caribbean cruise, the Bundys' and Darcys' (Amanda Bearse & Ted McGinley) end up lost at sea with comedian Gilbert Gottfried. The ninth season features some of the most memorable episodes of the comedy sitcom. The season features plenty of over-the-top humor and guest appearances from some big names from the world of sports. It also marks David Garrison's final two appearances as Steve Rhoades.Sony Pictures continues to disappoint us with their ""Married... with Children"" 3-disc box sets. All 28 episodes of this season including the ""Best of Bundy"" and ""My Favorite Married"" episodes are presented in their original broadcast full screen format. The picture quality isn't spectacular but the episodes do look better than the typical syndicated reruns. Its 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is satisfactory. Unfortunately, this is another simple 3-disc set with no decent extras other than two 3-minute mini-episodes of ""Facts of Life"" and ""Sheena"", and previews of upcoming Sony DVD releases.

1166618,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B001APMD1I,Taheen Lopez,"[1, 2]","It's about time that they brought this 1994-95 Season of MARRIED WITH CHILDREN out on DVD, since it's one of my favorite seasons throughout it's whole 10-year run on FOX.This is also the season when Harold Sylvester joins the cast and crew of this show as Al's divorced down on his luck co-worker(Griff)and when Juliette Tablak joins the cast and crew as Marcy's down on her luck niece(Amber).In fact, in this season I loved the episode when baseball celebrities Mike Piazzi and Joe Morgan do a cameo appearance in the episode when doofus Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill) and his buddies got busted for trespassing and Al ends up becoming famous and acknowledged as a baseball player afterwards when all sports go on strike.I also like the episode when famous DJ(Wolfman Jack) and comedian(Gilbert Gottfried)did a cameo appearance in the episode where the Bundys and the Darcys get stranded out to sea on their disasterous vacation.In addition, I enjoyed Larry Storch's cameo appearance in the episode when Al(Edward O'Neill) and Griff try to pull off a midnight show sale that falters until Larry Storch is knocked out in the shoe store having pictures taken with customers.The episode when the sexy blonde bombshell Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate) gets chosen to do a waist away diet drink commercial is hillarious too, since the daffy Kelly was never able to get the flavor right along with the fact that they didn't even end up using Kellys head for the commercial, but only used Kellys body for it, since Kelly was obviously quite slender and very sexy, plus I liked seeing Kelly in a sexy red bikini on the episode where she gets fired from her Verminator job after taking Jefferson's advice, but something else I noticed especially in this season was Christina Applegate did a lot of braless scenes, especially where Kellys tatas bounced a lot.In the meantime, I can hardly wait till this season comes out on DVD this Summer and I can hardly wait till the Bundy's 10th Season comes out on DVD too, since the 1995-96 Season is even better than the Bundy's 9th Season as well as the first 8 seasons, especially since Kelly seemed to have gotten sexier and sexier and a little bit more talented every year, despite her doofus Kelly Bundy character on Married With Children.In addition to why I like this Bundy's 9th Season DVD; I liked the way they had put the DVD's in a case to protect them along with the fact that both DVD cases provide a brief summary of each episode on the case instead of on a little booklet like they did with the first 7 seasons of Married With Children DVD's, since the DVD's are better protected, plus it's easier to just look up the summaries of each episode on the case instead of having to grab out the brochure of the episode summary.This DVD also contains the Bundy's 200th episode showing clips from Married With Children's greatest episodes from the 1st Season thru the 9th Season hosted by George Plimpton, which was quite intriguing.In addition to why I like watching MARRIED WITH CHILDREN; Christina Applegate is still one of my very favorite actresses and was my favorite actress back then when she played Kelly Bundy, not to mention I was so in love with her back then, but it's just too bad that Christina Applegate is dealing with breast cancer now at 36 almost 37 years old, but Applegate's mastectomy in 2008 has brought a great inspiration to most women battling breast cancer, especially young women along with the fact that my mother is a breast cancer survivor too just like Christina Applegate and her mother(Nancy Priddy).Therefore, I will always love Christina Applegate for her wonderful inspiration to women battling breast cancer along with the fact that MARRIED WITH CHILDREN is the show that made Christina Applegate a superstar and a very popular one still to this very day along with the fact that the Bundys was the first TV show on FOX and probably the longest running sitcom on FOX on top of that, which made MARRIED WITH CHILDREN like a pioneer in many ways, despite the fact that THE BUNDYS would've been a better name and title for this show instead of MARRIED WITH CHILDREN since THE BUNDYS would've fit the title better for what kind of lewd show this was.Unfortunately Sony didn't provide the posting of the original air-date of each episode either.For instance, the original air-dates to all these 1994-1995 Season episodes on FOX were9/4/94-SHOEWAY TO HEAVEN9/11/94-DRIVING MR.

TV and anyplace I know and even though this show is raunchy and kind of goofy, this show at least helps us appreciate not having the kind of problems or turmoil the Bundys always had and to be able to tell ourselves ""Thank God my family is not like that"" and/or ""Thank God I'm not like that"" along with the fact that this was the show that made a lot of people wanting to stay single and be childless and the show that every other person tried to get cancelled, due to the fact that this show was a bad influence since the Bundys were so crude all the time.This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to my last year of living in my hometown(El Centro, CA) since 1995 was the last year I had lived in the boring Imperial Valley.In the meantime, I just got word that the Bundy's 11th Season is currently underway and scheduled to be released on DVD this Fall on Tuesday October 13th, 2009 and I can hardly wait either since its the final and farewell season throughout Married With Children's whole 10-year run on FOX.",5,The Bundys Kick Ass!,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,6257,"['time', 'brought', '1994-95', 'Season', 'MARRIED', 'WITH', 'CHILDREN', 'out', 'DVD', 'one',

1166620,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B001APMD1I,Twiddles42,"[1, 4]","I bought the set mostly because the episodes with Steve always turn out to be hilarious. (Steve was the better hubby; everyone knows that...) A couple other episodes weer good, e.g. ""A Pot to Pease In"", but by this time the show was too one-joke and lacking the sharp satire of its earlier years. So they turn to episodes featuring Bud in a virtual machine, getting it on with an imaginary girlfriend... at least it had Elaine Hendrix, but it wasn't edgy or smart. It's solely 80s sex comedy mentality, now on the small screen.  Yawn.But I digress.  This year's ""Steve-o-Rama"" is twofold:1.  ""Get the Dodge out of Hell"".  Steve turns up at the car wash where Jefferson works; the Bundys get their Dodge washed.2.  ""Radio Free Trumaine"" - Steve is a college Dean, getting involved with a couple ribald campus DJs.  This is, if I recall, and thankfully, the LAST of a long series of 'spin-off' shows that MWC tried to create.  And also the best, again only because Steve provides a decent foil for the shock jock antics going on (in this pilot, the jocks turn from a mandated discussion of something ""decent"" to piping through Bud's conversation of trying to get a steady girlfriend...)And while ""The Naked and the Dead, but mostly Naked"" revolves around the wives going with their hubbies to the strip club, I always found the subplot with Kelly doing a diet commercial hilarious.""Driving Mr Boondy"", where Bud (an employee at the DMV) has to decide if Al's license gets renewed.The other episode worth looking at is ""Business Sucks"" - somewhat OTT, but a hilarious look on the controversial topic of breastfeeding in public. (I'll side with Al on this, as a biological function is a biological function. If it hadn't been for the censors, Al would have found a better parallel to use as well...)What really irked me was, when getting the set, they shoved 10 episodes per disc. People with LCD TVs might want to set their ""MPEG filter"" to ""high"" to get around that grainy look... I always thought 9 per disc was a stretch, but 10? Still, this season has 2 bonus episodes, and for that along it would be dumb to chuck in a fourth disc.
