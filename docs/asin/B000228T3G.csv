I trustI heard right.  In any event the acting cannot be faulted, but I found thestory line slow going. Craig Chester, Alexis Arquette, I admit I've liked injust about anything. However the drawbacks are generally technical.  Inone office scene, the lighting is so poor, the actors are overshadowedby light coming through a window behind them. (anybody hear of reflectors?)the Director of this film was said to have piloted the film ""The Fluffer""which was vastly superior in terms of lighting and picture.

821594,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000228T3G,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[4, 4]","Recently released for the first time on DVD, the 1994 dark comedy ""Grief"" stars Alexis Arquette, Jackie Beat, Craig Chester and Illeana Douglas as the creative team behind a sleazy TV soap called ""The Love Judge"".  Chester plays Mark, the show's head writer, a gay man who goes into depression on the 19th of each month (the anniversary of his lover's death to AIDS).  His co-workers include his best friend Jeremy (Carlton Wilborne) and young sexy Bill (Arquette), who is always talking about his girlfriend but still flirts openly with his male co-workers.  Their boss and ""den mother"" of sorts is Jo (played deadpan by draq queen Jackie Beat), whose assistant Leslie (Douglas) counts the minutes until she can sell a screenplay she is writing and quit her job. They get involved in impossible work deadlines, homophobic office politics from above, a secret affair and resulting jealousy, and competition for Jo's job when she announces she is leaving to marry her boyfriend in Prague.Believeable, fleshed-out characters in a setting that is just crazy enough to make it credible.  It's not much of a story, but you feel you know the characters and root for them to overcome their personal demons, whatever they may be.  You also get peeks at their TV show, which is a wild satirical take on ""Divorce Court""-type shows.  Overall, a positive message about friendship and loyalty, in a business where usually it's ""everyone for himself.""The film is a ten year old low-budget indie, and looks it.  The photography is lacking in spots, but the story and acting makes it worth while.  Nominated for prizes at the 1994 Sundance festival and at a couple of gay film festivals.",3,"Likeable characters in so-so story, but I liked it",1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,1671,"['Recently', 'released', 'first', 'time', 'DVD', '1994', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Grief', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', 'Jackie', 'Beat', 'Craig', 'Chester', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'creative', 'team', 'sleazy', 'TV', 'soap', 'called', 'Love', 'Judge', 'Chester', 'Mark', 'show', 'head', 'writer', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'depression', '19th', 'month', 'anniversary', 'lover', 'death', 'AIDS', 'co-workers', 'include', 'best', 'friend', 'Jeremy', 'Carlton', 'Wilborne', 'young', 'sexy', 'Bill', 'Arquette', 'who', 'always', 'talking', 'girlfriend', 'still', 'openly', 'male', 'co-workers', 'boss', 'den', 'mother', 'sorts', 'Jo', 'played', 'deadpan', 'draq', 'queen', 'Jackie', 'Beat', 'assistant', 'Leslie', 'Douglas', 'minutes', 'can', 'sell', 'screenplay', 'writing', 'quit', 'job', 'get', 'involved', 'impossible', 'work', 'deadlines', 'homophobic', 'office', 'politics', 'secret', 'affair', 'resulting', 'jealousy', 'competition', 'Jo', 'job', 'when', 'leaving', 'marry', 'boyfriend', 'Prague.Believeable', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'setting', 'just', 'crazy', 'enough', 'make', 'credible', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'feel', 'know', 'characters', 'root', 'overcome', 'personal', 'demons', 'may', 'be', 'also', 'get', 'peeks', 'TV', 'show', 'wild', 'satirical', 'take', 'Divorce', 'Court', '-type', 'shows', 'Overall', 'positive', 'message', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'business', 'where', 'usually', 'everyone', 'film', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'photography', 'lacking', 'spots', 'story', 'acting', 'worth', 'Nominated', 'prizes', '1994', 'Sundance', 'festival', 'couple', 'gay', 'film', 'festivals']",N/A

I'm still trying to figure out why I wanted to see this one. I think I must have bought it by accident. Nevertheless, it is a spoof about a group of very openly gay and lesbian people working on the staff of a crazy flamboyant TV soap Opera. It showcases their relationships, lust and personality traits. It is ok if you are into films of this nature. Not really my cup of tea but it did hold my attention enough that I didn't want to turn it off without seeing the whole thing. Perhaps that was in the hopes something would show up later in the film to take away the disappointment. I don't know. An indy film, thus quality is not expected to be at Hollywood status and of course wasn't. Not bad all in all if you like this type of production.

821596,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B000228T3G,J. Martin,"[0, 0]","Grief is a fantastic movie. Most of the (shockingly few) other reviewers must have had their heads elsewhere while they watched it.It is a modest but beautifully written, directed and acted drama about the family-like team of misfit writers of a low-brow afternoon-TV divorce-court show. The excerpts from The Love Judge are always hilarious (especially the ""Circus Lesbians"" episode, which had me rolling on the floor), but the behind-the-scenes drama is pure character study, serious but never plodding. All the comedy is in the Love Judge segments, which are well integrated into the backstage drama as the writers wrestle with the relevant scripts.The writers (played by Craig Chester, Alexis Arquette, Lucy Gutteridge and Carlton Wilborn) are presided over by the show's producer Jo (Jackie Beat, aka Kent Fuher, who also plays a polar-opposite thug in ""Circus Lesbians"") and her writer-wannabe assistant Leslie (Illeana Douglas), with a few peripheral characters. The whole cast is fantastic, especially Chester and Beat/Fuher - and it's the first time I've ever seen Arquette actually act (ie, play a character who isn't him, in this case a mostly straight guy), and he's not bad! The several sources of drama are all believable, and the resolution is satisfying without being in any way forced.I really, truly love this movie! I'm astounded that it has been so badly overlooked and dissed in the 20 years since it was made. Shame on the reviewers - here and elsewhere - who have treated it with such contempt! Not only does it deserve to be considered a gay classic, but it's a much better movie than most that are. It's extremely well made, great fun to watch, very entertaining and very satisfying.",5,"A fantastic movie, shockingly overlooked and unappreciated",1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,1708,"['Grief', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'Most', 'shockingly', 'few', 'other', 'reviewers', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'heads', 'elsewhere', 'watched', 'it.It', 'modest', 'beautifully', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'drama', 'family-like', 'team', 'misfit', 'writers', 'low-brow', 'afternoon-TV', 'divorce-court', 'show', 'excerpts', 'Love', 'Judge', 'are', 'always', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'Circus', 'Lesbians', 'episode', 'had', 'rolling', 'floor', 'behind-the-scenes', 'drama', 'pure', 'character', 'study', 'serious', 'never', 'plodding', 'comedy', 'Love', 'Judge', 'segments', 'are', 'well', 'integrated', 'backstage', 'drama', 'writers', 'wrestle', 'relevant', 'scripts.The', 'writers', 'played', 'Craig', 'Chester', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', 'Lucy', 'Gutteridge', 'Carlton', 'Wilborn', 'are', 'presided', 'show', 'producer', 'Jo', 'Jackie', 'Beat', 'aka', 'Kent', 'Fuher', 'who', 'also', 'polar-opposite', 'thug', 'Circus', 'Lesbians', 'writer-wannabe', 'assistant', 'Leslie', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'few', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'whole', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'especially', 'Chester', 'Beat/Fuher', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Arquette', 'actually', 'act', 'ie', 'play', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'case', 'mostly', 'straight', 'guy', 'not', 'bad', 'several', 'sources', 'drama', 'are', 'believable', 'resolution', 'satisfying', 'being', 'way', 'forced.I', 'really', 'truly', 'love', 'movie', ""'m"", 'astounded', 'been', 'so', 'badly', 'overlooked', 'dissed', '20', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'Shame', 'reviewers', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'who', 'have', 'treated', 'such', 'contempt', 'Not', 'only', 'deserve', 'be', 'considered', 'gay', 'classic', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'most', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'very', 'entertaining', 'very', 'satisfying']",N/A
