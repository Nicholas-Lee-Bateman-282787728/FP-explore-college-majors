630925,ACC1SLND21RI6,B00005JNIS,Breyel,"[1, 1]","What a great comedy! I can't imagine two better guys than Mark Linn-Baker (Larry Appleton) and Bronson Pinchot (Balki Bartokomous) pulling off these `distant' cousins - one from mythical Mypos, the other from Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The comedic timing between them is pitch perfect.In my book any show or film -- especially an American comedy like PERFECT STRANGERS -- that can transcend cultural and generational differences is a true classic. I've run the litmus test on my Malaysian wife, our teenage daughter and her cousins, and they all found the show to be absolutely hilarious. It's so good that all six discs from Seasons 1 and 2 have been played twice -- soon to be the third  --  since purchasing from Amazon. Needless to say, we can't wait for Warner Brothers to release the remaining six seasons.I've even read that PERFECT STRANGERS was considered one of Lucille Ball's favourite comedies of the 1980s. And little wonder. The situation comedy and slapstick humour are all pages right out ofI Love Lucy - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-6).My apologies  to reviewer, Jae-Ha Kim. I think Ball is a better judge of comedy than you; I don't buy your line that ""Perfect Strangers is an outdated show that isn't as funny as it thinks it is.""  Please, don't be ridiculous!Now, if I really want to nit-pick over PERFECT STRANGERS, I've got to say the digital transfer is pretty shabby at the start. The opening frames for the show seem to be fuzzy VCR clips. Thankfully it's just a minute or so, and the actual content of the show is clear and the audio alright. The packaging is a bit flimsy too. So are the DVD cases; my DVDs fall out of the cases very easily.Otherwise, the clash-of-culture comedy of PERFECT STRANGERS is brilliant...all 28 episodes!!!",5,"Of course, their Perfect Strangers.

630927,A3SHA4Y9DHEK39,B00005JNIS,Chad Oberholtzer,"[0, 0]","During my formative years in the 1980's, ""Perfect Strangers"" was one of my favorite television programs, with just enough slapstick to keep my childish sense of humor interested and clean enough for my parents to allow me to watch it.  It's been many, many years since I have seen the show, so I was delighted to discover this DVD release on Amazon and thrilled when my wife bought it for me for Christmas.  And, in general, it's been great fun to enjoy the crazy shenanigans of Balki and Cousin Larry once again.It is not hard to critique ""Perfect Strangers,"" which hasn't entirely aged well.  The writing is absolutely dreadful at times, with absurdly wooden dialogue and lame, expected jokes.  The directing seems to be sporadically absent.  The acting of the extras, and even some of the recurring characters, is truly painful.  (Could Mr. Twinkacetti be any more of a caricature?)  The stories are overly formulaic, with an unnecessarily heavy-handed ""lesson"" explained at the end of most episodes.  And even the acting of the two lead roles is sometimes over-the-top and very forced at times.  Ultimately, ""Perfect Strangers"" manages to fall victim to most of the weaknesses of sitcoms in its era.Nonetheless, some of the writing is actually quite clever, especially with Balki's linguistic and cultural confusion.  The physical comedy is often hysterical.  And some of the stories are quite sweet, offering genuinely touching moments between Balki and Larry.  Ultimately, I think that it would be difficult for anyone to watch these episodes without any previous experience with the show, as it falls prey to numerous short-comings.  But for anyone with even a hint of nostalgia for ""Perfect Strangers,"" I am confident that you'll enjoy many laughs and genuinely appreciate what made this show such a hit with so many of us a few decades ago.",4,A delightful blast from the past...,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,1849,"['formative', 'years', '1980', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'television', 'programs', 'just', 'enough', 'slapstick', 'keep', 'childish', 'sense', 'humor', 'interested', 'clean', 'enough', 'parents', 'allow', 'watch', 'been', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'was', 'delighted', 'discover', 'DVD', 'release', 'Amazon', 'thrilled', 'when', 'wife', 'bought', 'Christmas', 'general', 'been', 'great', 'fun', 'enjoy', 'crazy', 'shenanigans', 'Balki', 'Cousin', 'Larry', 'once', 'again.It', 'not', 'hard', 'critique', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'aged', 'well', 'writing', 'absolutely', 'dreadful', 'times', 'absurdly', 'wooden', 'dialogue', 'lame', 'expected', 'jokes', 'directing', 'be', 'sporadically', 'absent', 'acting', 'extras', 'even', 'recurring', 'characters', 'truly', 'painful', 'Could', 'Mr.', 'Twinkacetti', 'be', 'more', 'caricature', 'stories', 'are', 'overly', 'formulaic', 'unnecessarily', 'heavy-handed', 'lesson', 'explained', 'end', 'most', 'episodes', 'even', 'acting', 'two', 'lead', 'roles', 'sometimes', 'over-the-top', 'very', 'forced', 'times', 'Ultimately', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'fall', 'victim', 'most', 'weaknesses', 'sitcoms', 'era.Nonetheless', 'writing', 'actually', 'quite', 'clever', 'especially', 'Balki', 'linguistic', 'cultural', 'confusion', 'physical', 'comedy', 'often', 'hysterical', 'stories', 'are', 'quite', 'sweet', 'offering', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments', 'Balki', 'Larry', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'anyone', 'watch', 'episodes', 'previous', 'experience', 'show', 'prey', 'numerous', 'short-comings', 'anyone', 'even', 'hint', 'nostalgia', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'am', 'confident', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'many', 'laughs', 'genuinely', 'appreciate', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'hit', 'so', 'many', 'few', 'decades', 'ago']",N/A

This arrangement was still quite common back in the 1980s, as big-city living comes with a high price, henceforth the sharing of quarters.. Such an arrangement tests the friendship of these two -  even though they are cousins. One will find plenty to laugh about & at in these two seasons, as Larry & Balki find themselves working for a manipulative & tough boss, Mr. Twinkacetti (played by Ernie Sabella). His wife, Edwina, is the voice of reason. Edwina is played by Belita Moreno. We meet Balki Bartokomous right off the bat in the opening episode ""Knock Knock, Who's There"". Larry has a difficult time believing & accepting that Balki is his cousin, although they are distant cousins. We also learn Larry's a wannabe photographer in the episode ""Picture This"" - where he learns Dolly Parton's in Chicago. He wants to take THE picture that will get Larry his big break, but Balki has other ideas! Socially, Balki's a little wet-behind-the-ears, especially in the dating department. In ""First Date"", Larry advises Balki on how to handle women, with surprising & hilarious results! Balki wants to obtain his driver's license, so Larry instructs him on how to drive in ""Baby, You Can Drive My Car"". These are some of the highlights of Season One. Season Two contains a lot of memorable, funny moments, like in the episode ""Babes In Babylon"" - where Larry (Mark Linn-Baker) & Balki (Bronson Pinchot) vacation in Las Vegas. Larry educates Balki about the dangers of gambling, & Larry ends up losing everything including his shirt! ""The Rent Strike"" finds the boys at odds with their landlord, who happens to be Mr. Twinkacetti! Twinkacetti ends up moving in with Larry & Balki in ""Trouble In Paradise"" after a fight with Mrs. Twinkacetti, & we meet Jennifer (Melanie Wilson) & Mary-Anne (Rebeca Arthur) for the first time in ""Trouble In Paradise"". Larry needs to take an aerial photograph in ""Up On A Roof"" - the trouble is, he takes the picture on Twinkacetti's roof! There are plenty of episodes to choose from between these two seasons.

I loved the show then and still do now.  I get to watch any episode whenever i choose and still has all the laughs, puns and the Dance of Joy that i love seeing Balki and cousin Larry perform when something great happens or when the mood strikes.  This one is packed with 28 episodes encompassing Season 1 and 2 of the show.My favorite is the two parter Snow Way To Treat a Lady.  As Larry, Balki, Jennifer get trapped in a cabin after a certain someone professes how great of a skier that he is.  But he ends up falling twisting his ankle that seems to switch legs at random moments.  They are trapped in an avalanche and the hi-jinks, crying and everything else all come out in this two part episode.  Season 2 ends with Larry's sister Elaine stopping by for a visit before she heads off to Big Apple or Pineapple as Balki likes to say.  Once Larry finds out his sis isn't going off to college he reminds her on a daily basis that she's making a huge mistake and screwing up her life.  But in the end common sense and good ole brother sister love prevail through his outdated and close minded thinking.If anything Perfect Strangers is one of those shows that i grew up with in the 80s that i still love and hold dear even after all this time.

630940,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B00005JNIS,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[6, 6]","""You saved my life you took me in""-Balki to his cousin Larry.Well finally after what it seems forever the great comedy series from ABC comes to DVD. People talk about great comedy duos like  Abbott and Costello, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz but to me Mark Linn-Baker and Bronson Pinchott belong in that category. I mean without a doubt Perfect Strangers along with shows like Full House is one of the most popular 80/90s shows ABC has produced.It's interesting to watch these episodes from the beginning. Cousin Larry wasn't very ambitious at all. He was happy just to be an average working stiff working in Ritz Discount store for the bossy and mean Mr. Twinkacetti (although we get some brief moments and eps showing Larry's desire to get into journalism). It's also interesting that before Mary Anne and Jennifer came into Larry and Balki's life there was the beautiful Susan Campbell (played by Lise Cutter) as their next door neighbor (I sure would love to live next door to her).Anyways, the longevity of the show can be seen in the QUALITY of the acting and comedy. Mark Linn-Baker and Bronson Pinchot are two underrated actors that don't get talked about much today which is sad. The show was funny but could be dramatic, sad, uplifting and heartwarming and all that lies with Pinchot and Baker delivering one great performance after another.Then comes the many themes of the show including the one of an immigrant learning about America and doing what he can do to be accepted into the culture. This is probably what appeals to me the most even today since we have a lot anti-immigrant feelings and racism in 2008 when in fact America is a land based off immigrants. Speaking of which that theme song ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now"" is one of these great TV theme songs that stick with you forever. For this show it was a perfect fit as it pretty much said what this show was going to be about two best friends who were going to achieve their dreams for better or worse.We also get to see Larry move on his way up to become a journalist. Of course the wacky adventures are also a big part of the show that comes through when an outsider from another country accustoms himself to the American way of life with hilarious results such as Balki trying to pick up women and in another episode learning how to say ""No"" to Balki being initiated into a biker gang. Balki was the spontaneous, loose guy while Cousin Larry was the stiff, by the books type of guy and it's fun to see these two guys mesh.Anyways good DVD set, only nitpick is that special features were slim. I mean this show had hundreds of promos during it's day and yet we only get the ""Dance of Joy"" montage?Well hopefully when they release the other seasons will see a boatload of special features. However, for those people who watched the show but whatever reason don't have this DVD set it is a must buy.

630950,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B00005JNIS,JGC,"[8, 8]","""Perfect Strangers"" was a classic meeting of two completely different people. Comic-genius Bronson Pinchot (who was in the Tom Cruise movie,Risky Business) played Balki Bartokomous; an innocent (and very naive) man who came to the US for the first time from the fictitious land of Mypos. Balki winds up staying with his cousin (albeit, very distant,) Larry Appleton. Mark Linn-Baker (also known for the cult-classic,My Favorite Year) played the straight-laced, no-nonsense Larry. Larry is on his own for the first time and hardly wants to share his apartment with someone else, least of all a stranger. ...Thus, the premise of ""Perfect Strangers"" is born. It was always so funny seeing Larry try to convince Balki to do something because some type of slapstick comedy would usually develop. And, it was equally funny when Balki didn't understand something (remember this is his first time in a new country,) such as the time Larry took him to the singles bar for the first time!There are a total of 28 eps from both Season 1 & Season 2.

Larry and Balki were still working in the Ritz Discount store where their adventures seemed a bit forced. It wasn't until years later when they met those blonde chicks, married them, and moved into a big house together that their mark was made on American television. Much like the later seasons of One Day at a Time, the real comedy could not exist until they were all in a single house. This meant less time figuring out excuses to get them to visit each other, and more time spent crafting intricate runs of slapstick comedy that would make laurel and hardy come back from the dead, laugh their hineys off, then commit shameful seppuku.Simply stated, if you are a Perfect Strangers purist, you have to have the complete run, so this box is a steal at the low price its being offered at.

630952,A2MI2QMF9XSG9C,B00005JNIS,John Corbett,"[77, 82]","Perfect Strangers debuted to high ratings and critical praise in March 1986.  Comfortably nestled betweenWho's the Boss?andMoonlightingon ABC's Tuesday night lineup whileGrowing Painstook a break, Perfect Strangers was hailed by critics as a refreshing blend of witty humor and slapstick delivery.  Co-stars Mark Linn-Baker (Larry Appleton) and Bronson Pinchot (Balki Bartokomous) were lauded for their unmatched chemistry and comic talent.  Comic legend Lucille Ball called it her favorite comedy.  The show returned in the fall of 1986 on Wednesday nights paired with Head Of The Class, and continued to win its time slot.  (It would be at least another two years before Perfect Strangers would become the centerpiece of ABC's TGIF Friday night lineup.)The new DVD box set from Warner Bros. containing the first two seasons of the hit series allows longtime fans and newcomers alike to rediscover this wonderful, often overlooked sitcom gem from the 1980s.  The premise of the series is simple and attractive.  At the start of the pilot episode, Larry had just moved from his crowded childhood home in Madison, Wisconsin, to an apartment in Chicago, where he planned to make it as a photojournalist.  To pay his bills, he found a job working at a discount store for the heartless Mr. Twinkacetti.  One evening, a distant cousin shows up at his door, bearing his possessions in a box mislabeled ""America or Burst.""  Balki has made his way from the Mediterranean island country of Mypos to start a new life in America.  Unfortunately, there aren't many jobs in Chicago for sheepherders, so Larry lets Balki move in with him until he can get settled.Balki innocently sees America through a scattered and chaotic series of images and slogans he has picked up along the way.  ""America, land of my dreams, home of the Whopper!"" he exclaims.  When he finds out he is in debt, Balki proudly asserts ""now I am a true American.""  He may not realize that groveling is not the proper way to pick up American women, but he is a virtual encyclopedia of references to stars from Telly Savalas to Bo Derek.  And then there's his weakness for Wayne Newton, the most popular singer on Mypos.Larry views himself as the person to educate the naive but big-hearted Balki in the complex ways of American life.  In various episodes, Larry attempts to teach his cousin about everything from dating and opening a checking account to driving a car and joining a ""healthy club.""  But Larry is not as schooled in the ways of life as he likes to portray himself.  When Larry's big ideas inevitably lead to chaos, it is often Balki that gives Larry a useful nugget of wisdom.  This is the true strength of the show - for all the talk of Perfect Strangers being about a zany immigrant, the show is at its core about two people from different backgrounds who become inseparable when they discover how much they really need each other.The box set contains all six episodes from the spring 1986 run, and the 22 episodes comprising the 1986-87 season.  The packaging is colorful and informative, as the plastic slipcases give episode titles, writer and director information, airdates, and witty blurbs about each episode plot.  Thankfully, all episodes appear to be uncut, so they can be watched as they were originally seen on ABC.  Even the original Lorimar-Telepictures logo at the end of each episode is preserved.  And for those of you who have endured theWKRPDVD debacle, it should be noted that all the music appears to be intact.  Balki sings a number of songs in the episodes, from Tina Turner's ""What's Love Got To Do With It"" to Dolly Parton's ""9 To 5,"" and they're all here.One significant criticism is that the episodes do not appear to have been remastered from the original film, but rather taken from a video master.  Although the picture quality is less than ideal given the potential of the DVD format, the look is still equal to if not superior to what has been available in syndication or on AOL's In2TV.In the end, this DVD set is a must buy.  This show is quite addictive, and it gets even better as the seasons roll on.  Early in Season Two, we are introduced to Jennifer Lyons (Melanie Wilson) and Mary Anne Spencer (Rebeca Arthur), who will continue as Larry and Balki's love interests, respectively, throughout the rest of the series.  Larry and Balki remain working for Twinkacetti at Ritz Discount during the first two seasons in this set, although they are constantly chafing to do something more.  At the beginning of Season Three, the two of them get jobs in the basement of the Chicago Chronicle, where Larry cuts his teeth as a cub reporter and Balki works in the mailroom.  On the home front that same season they are seen in a new apartment where Balki has his own room and no longer has to sleep on the sofa.  (Many have commented on the fact that the move was never explictly referenced in the show, and that Jennifer and Mary Anne were still their neighbors even in the new apartment building - but we'll leave those controversies for the Season Three review!)If enough people buy Seasons One and Two, Warner Bros. hopefully will release Season Three in the near future, and the fun will continue!",5,Great show makes its belated appearance on DVD,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,5202,"['Perfect', 'Strangers', 'debuted', 'high', 'ratings', 'critical', 'praise', 'March', '1986',

I used to watch it growing up and I'd tape it each week, and watch it over and over until the next weeks show and then tape that and repeat.  It's so funny (yet by todays standards it's quite reserved) and enjoyable.  I LOVE Balki and Larry and together they had great comic chemistry together.Balki Bartokomous came from Mypos ('in the Meditteranean') to move to the great land of America.  He looks up his long lost cousin (seemingly barely related) Larry who himself has just left home for the windy city of Chicago.  He can't refuse Balki a night or two in his home, but when Balki does good at Larry's work, he's hired there too and so he stays longer with Larry and so begins their story.  Balki plays an innocent type guy with no real life experience who discovers the joys of everyday living and life with the help of Larry in America.  His most famous saying is ""Of course I do/did, don't be redikalus"" and each time I hear that I still roll about laughing (I believe he was nominated for an Emmy once for his role as Balki).You have to do yourself a favour and pick up a copy of this.

You get two complete seasons (6 episodes from Season One and 22 episodes from Season Two) on four discs. This release is full-screen as could be expected (1.33:1). There is also a bonus feature (Dance of Joy: Merry montage of Balki and Larry's signature two-step throughout the show's first two seasons). In regards to Seasons 3-8, an article on TVShowsOnDVD.com regarding TV series with stalled DVD releases mentioned that the main hold-up for any subsequent releases of Perfect Strangers is not poor sales but rather high music licensing costs. The series sometimes featured popular songs within certain episodes, though the versions by the artists who originally performed them were usually not used, instead they were commonly sung acapella by Mark Linn-Baker and Bronson Pinchot's characters whenever the script called for Balki or Larry to sing within the episode. Fortunately, this release contains unedited episodes (the shortest episode runs 23:55 and the longest is 25:18 which seems to be extended from any of the syndicated broadcasts that I can recall) along with the original music. Fans will recall Seasons 1 & 2 had the opening sequence with images of Balki and Larry on opposite sides of the screen. Larry and Balki spend more time saying good-bye to their families. Seasons 3-8 begin with a close-up on Larry and Balki on the back of a tour boat heading east down the Chicago River that is more familiar to most audiences.My only real complaints are that the picture and audio quality are fairly average because they haven't been remastered. Also, more bonus features like a documentary on the making of the series, outtakes and an audio commentary would be a treat for fans in future seasons.Buy this collection.
