When a young girl is taken to a cursed, remote island by her mom, she comes to learn about the history of this place.

Only problem is, all the townsfolk seem to know this secret, except of course Miss Silly.  Uhmm . . . I wonder how she got that silly name?

673798,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005Q4DZ,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[23, 27]","""I'll start at the beginning, as all stories must...""- Celia (Lynn Redgrave)A good story has the power to heal and if you have seen The Secret of Roan Inish, you will enjoy this story even more. You are immediately drawn into this haunting tale by a rather moody Claire Mackay (Julia Brendler), a grieving teenage violinist who seems uninterested in living in an isolated island community off the coast of Nova Scotia.She and her mother (Alberta Watson)  arrive on the island and Claire is given a package to deliver, which she forgets at the beach. After a fight with her mother, she finds an emotional release in swimming as far as she can into the water's salty soul. The viewer might assume she has drowned as I did, but suddenly we find her washed up on the beach with the small package floating in the edges of the foamy surf at her bare feet.Claire's brooding moods almost border on depression at first until she finds Celia (Lynn Redgrave), the owner of the package. We soon find out this is a story Celia is writing has been rejected by the publishers. As she hangs the dripping pages up to dry on the clothesline, Claire becomes rather interested in the story.Two stories then start to intertwine like seaweed waving on the floor of the ocean. Claire and Silly's lives have so many similarities. They are almost mirrors to one another's souls. Celia knows that her story was just waiting for Claire to discover it.Silly (Kirsten Dunst) is the girl in Celia's story who is born at the beginning of the fishing season on a cursed island, she has a strange affinity to the call of the sea. As she swims in the ocean as a very young child, her eyes change color and this startles her mother. No one in the fishing village will tell her about the ancient legend of a Viking ship that passed by so long ago and was shipwrecked near the island.The island is cursed and every 50 years the fish dissapear and someone drowns to break the curse. Everyone on the island believes that the sea has come to take that individual as a sacrifice. While this part of the story seems pretty intense, it is played out rather mildly in the film.This is also a love story where two people find one another quite by chance.  James (Trent Ford), the son of a wealthy British Admiral is drawn to the island and falls in love with Silly. He spends most of his time camped out in a tent on the beach where they meet occasionally. James and Silly share moments of happiness, but sadly make the mistake of taking destiny in their own hands and run into a storm they cannot control.If you love the sound of the ocean, the feel of sand between your toes and a salty breeze tousling your hair, this movie will take you there.Lingering memories melt with myth to capture theessence of beauty you expect from a fairy tale.~The Rebecca Review",5,An Insatiable Ocean,1013126400,"02 8, 2002",2002,2816,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'beginning', 'stories', 'must', 'Celia', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'A', 'good', 'story', 'power', 'heal', 'have', 'seen', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'will', 'enjoy', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'are', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'haunting', 'tale', 'rather', 'moody', 'Claire', 'Mackay', 'Julia', 'Brendler', 'grieving', 'teenage', 'violinist', 'who', 'uninterested', 'living', 'isolated', 'island', 'community', 'coast', 'Nova', 'Scotia.She', 'mother', 'Alberta', 'Watson', 'arrive', 'island', 'Claire', 'given', 'package', 'deliver', 'beach', 'fight', 'mother', 'emotional', 'release', 'swimming', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'water', 'salty', 'soul', 'viewer', 'might', 'assume', 'drowned', 'did', 'suddenly', 'find', 'washed', 'up', 'beach', 'small', 'package', 'floating', 'edges', 'foamy', 'surf', 'bare', 'feet.Claire', 'brooding', 'moods', 'almost', 'border', 'depression', 'first', 'Celia', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'owner', 'package', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'story', 'Celia', 'writing', 'been', 'rejected', 'publishers', 'dripping', 'up', 'dry', 'clothesline', 'Claire', 'rather', 'interested', 'story.Two', 'stories', 'then', 'start', 'intertwine', 'seaweed', 'waving', 'floor', 'ocean', 'Claire', 'Silly', 'lives', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'similarities', 'are', 'almost', 'mirrors', 'one', 'souls', 'Celia', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'Claire', 'discover', 'it.Silly', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'girl', 'Celia', 'story', 'who', 'born', 'beginning', 'fishing', 'season', 'cursed', 'island', 'strange', 'affinity', 'call', 'sea', 'ocean', 'very', 'young', 'child', 'eyes', 'change', 'color', 'mother', 'one', 'fishing', 'village', 'will', 'tell', 'ancient', 'legend', 'Viking', 'ship', 'passed', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'shipwrecked', 'island.The', 'island', 'cursed', '50', 'years', 'fish', 'dissapear', 'someone', 'drowns', 'break', 'curse', 'Everyone', 'island', 'sea', 'come', 'take', 'individual', 'sacrifice', 'part', 'story', 'pretty', 'intense', 'played', 'out', 'rather', 'mildly', 'film.This', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'find', 'one', 'quite', 'chance', 'James', 'Trent', 'Ford', 'son', 'wealthy', 'British', 'Admiral', 'drawn', 'island', 'love', 'Silly', 'most', 'time', 'camped', 'out', 'tent', 'beach', 'where', 'meet', 'occasionally', 'James', 'Silly', 'share', 'moments', 'happiness', 'sadly', 'make', 'mistake', 'taking', 'destiny', 'own', 'hands', 'run', 'storm', 'can', 'not', 'control.If', 'love', 'sound', 'ocean', 'feel', 'sand', 'toes', 'salty', 'breeze', 'tousling', 'hair', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'there.Lingering', 'memories', 'melt', 'myth', 'capture', 'theessence', 'beauty', 'expect', 'fairy', 'tale.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Deeply
673799,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005Q4DZ,Reviewer,"[0, 1]","A remote fishing village located off the coast of Canada is the setting for this tale of a close-knit community of people who make their living from the sea, while abiding the customs and superstitions that have been handed down from one generation to the next for hundreds of years.  ""Deeply,"" written and directed by Sheri Elwood, is a story of love and survival, and of what it sometimes takes just to get on with life; but more than that, it's about a dark secret that has been a part of this village since before remembrance, and the effects of a collective belief in something few care to contemplate and even fewer dare to speak of openly, even in a contemporary, modern world in which such things no longer exist-- and yet still do.When her teenage daughter, Claire (Julia Brendler), cannot escape the memories of a tragic accident, Fiona McKay (Alberta Watson) takes her to the island and the village that was her own home as a child.  Fiona hopes the change will enable Claire to put all that has happened behind her.  Claire's depression continues, however, and she becomes increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative, even with her mother, who is desperately trying to reach out and help her.Things begin to change, however, when Claire finds a manuscript on the beach that's been rejected and returned by the publisher, and she delivers it to the owner, a reclusive writer named Celia (Lynn Redgrave), a long time resident of the island who lives alone in a small house at the edge of the sea.  Initially their relationship is tentative, but gradually Claire finds herself drawn to Celia, who agrees to tell Claire the story contained in the manuscript; and it's a story in which Claire finds a parallel to her own life-- and it just may prove to be the catharsis that will enable Claire to move on with her life.Writer/director Elwood uses the story-within-a-story technique nicely to present her tale, which contains elements that make it something of a cross between ""The Secret of Roan Inish"" and ""The Wicker Man.""  It's beautifully filmed (cinematography by Sebastian Edschmid), and the transitions between the present and the depiction of Celia's story are executed quite well.  The story itself, though, while engaging to a point, is wrapped in a fairly obvious mystery, which in retrospect may have been Elwood's intent, as she creates the dots but leaves it up to the viewer to connect them.  It's effective in that it invites involvement on any number of levels, while leaving it up to the individual to decide upon one and to what extent they want to take it.  Celia's story, which involves a young girl named Silly (Kirsten Dunst) is interesting, but the real appeal of the film is rooted in Claire's gradual awareness of her deep connection to Silly, and how the story subsequently affects her.  And it's in the telling of Claire's story that Elwood's work shines the brightest, as that is where she manages somewhat to connect emotionally with her audience.One of the best young actors in the business, Kirsten Dunst is to be commended for taking on a role that is quite a departure for her (with the exception of her portrayal of Marion Davies in the more recent ""The Cat's Meow,"" in which she was terrific).  Dunst has a charismatic screen presence and talent to match, which has served her so well in films like ""The Virgin Suicides"" and the aforementioned ""The Cat's Meow,"" and it's obvious that she put a great deal of effort into her portrayal of Silly in this film; and though it's a decent job, she somehow never manages to fully realize the character, and though she has her moments, Silly is never entirely convincing.  Part of the blame has to fall on Elwood, of course, who should have taken measures to correct the most obvious flaw in Dunst's performance, which is the inconsistency of the accent she affects.  Part of the time her manner of speech most resembles Lux Lisbon, while at other times she sounds more like Ma Kettle's daughter.  It is, perhaps, a minor flaw in an otherwise solid performance, but it's enough to prevent Dunst from ""finding"" the character, and it is so distracting that it diminishes the effectiveness of her portrayal, and in turn the credibility of the film.  And there are a couple of scenes in which Silly smokes a pipe that simply do not work at all.  Still, you have to admire Dunst for wanting to expand her repertoire and explore new territory; many actors who have achieved a similar level of success lack the courage to challenge themselves artistically as Dunst has done here, and it's an attribute that will continue to set her apart from the dime-a-dozen actors who flow through the business without making so much as a dent.As Claire, Julia Brendler gives a performance that is honest and affecting, and as much as the story itself, it's what establishes her as the focus of the film.  She conveys emotions that transcend the typical teen angst, and it makes her situation real and believable.  Her portrayal of Claire is sensitive and (with Elwood's help, of course) is developed with great care, which is what makes it so effective.  The film, in fact, would have benefited had Claire's part been expanded, perhaps with more interaction between her and Celia.  As presented, however, it is definitely the strength of the film.Lynn Redgrave does a good job as Celia, though she isn't afforded enough screen time to fully develop her character with any nuance; but it is a convincing performance.  Interestingly enough, this was filmed the same year her sister, Vanessa, played a similar role, that of a reclusive old woman living by the sea, in ""A Rumor of Angels.""  A good film, but nothing special, ""Deeply"" is worth a look; just don't expect to be too emotionally engaged by it.",3,Lacks Any Real Emotional Connection,1027382400,"07 23,

I failed to connect with any of the lead characters, the plot seemed to switch indiscriminately between past and the present, and we never did get to learn more about the ""curse."" or what exactly was ""In the water.""

673803,A1F6Q5Q0U6MS5X,B00005Q4DZ,Tim F. Martin,"[5, 7]","_Deeply_ is a beautifully filmed if rather somber movie, ostensibly a fantasy story but with the magical elements very subtle. Really it is two stories. One is a framing modern day story, perhaps not unlike say _The Princess Bride_, though this plotline is much more serious. It focuses on a teenager who had undergone some sort of trauma while at school in Europe, a trauma only hinted at and not revealed until much later in the film. Brought to an island community (never named), one that used to thrive on fishing but is now largely uninhabited, this teenager, Claire McKay, has moved into a house with her mother and her uncle. Not only not wanting to be on the very isolated island (there is only one boat on the island and it is frequently in use), Claire doesn't want to talk to her mother or her uncle and just wants to grieve. Her mom and her uncle think they are doing the right thing by bringing her to the island, but Claire doesn't seem to think so at all.She becomes, after a time, friends with an eccentric next neighbor, a near elderly woman by the name of Celia (played by Lynn Redgrave). Celia engaged Claire's interest by reading a story she had been writing, one that would appear to have had no ending until Claire showed up, a tragic tale set on the same island in the 1940s, one involving another teenager, a woman by the name of Silly (played by Kirsten Dunst).The fantasy elements revolve around the founding myth of the island, that the first would-be settlers were Vikings, and one Viking couple, a man and a woman, the woman pregnant with the couple's child, perished in a storm before they could reach the island's shores. Just before they perished beneath the sea, they cursed the island, the curse being that every 50 years the fish would dry up unless a chosen one, apparently a young woman, sacrificed herself. Was Silly that chosen one that story seems to ask? Was the curse real? Is that her destiny?The viewer never is sure if that is curse is real or not, as while the islanders take it seriously, outsiders do not, and there are little obvious magical elements except on two occasions (and even those occasions are open to interpretation).Really for me the movie is about accepting the loss of loved ones, of moving on, perhaps dealing with survivor's guilt. The story-within-the-story, starring Ms. Dunst is a romance, at times funny, but without giving too much away is ultimately tragic.I found the movie a bit somber at times, moody, many scenes of quiet people contemplating the sea while the waves crashed on the shore and orchestral music could be heard in the background or for the story of Silly, much of that revolved around a rebellious teenager (echoing the quieter rebellions of the grieving Claire in the present). Sometimes I found the pace a bit slow but I thought it well made. The scenery was beautiful, Ms. Dunst is a good actress, and I generally liked it.",4,"Nice fantasy tale, slow-paced but well made with beautiful scenery",1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,2915,"['_Deeply_', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'rather', 'somber', 'movie', 'ostensibly', 'fantasy', 'story', 'magical', 'elements', 'very', 'subtle', 'Really', 'two', 'stories', 'One', 'framing', 'modern', 'day', 'story', 'perhaps', 'not', 'say', '_The', 'Princess', 'Bride_', 'plotline', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'teenager', 'who', 'had', 'sort', 'trauma', 'school', 'Europe', 'trauma', 'only', 'hinted', 'not', 'revealed', 'much', 'later', 'film', 'Brought', 'island', 'community', 'never', 'named', 'one', 'used', 'thrive', 'fishing', 'now', 'largely', 'uninhabited', 'teenager', 'Claire', 'McKay', 'moved', 'house', 'mother', 'uncle', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'very', 'isolated', 'island', 'only', 'one', 'boat', 'island', 'frequently', 'use', 'Claire', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'mother', 'uncle', 'just', 'grieve', 'mom', 'uncle', 'think', 'are', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'bringing', 'island', 'Claire', ""n't"", 'seem', 'think', 'so', 'all.She', 'becomes', 'time', 'friends', 'eccentric', 'next', 'neighbor', 'near', 'elderly', 'woman', 'name', 'Celia', 'played', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Celia', 'engaged', 'Claire', 'interest', 'reading', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'writing', 'one', 'would', 'appear', 'have', 'had', 'ending', 'Claire', 'showed', 'up', 'tragic', 'tale', 'set', 'same', 'island', '1940s', 'one', 'involving', 'teenager', 'woman', 'name', 'Silly', 'played', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', '.The', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'revolve', 'founding', 'myth', 'island', 'first', 'would-be', 'settlers', 'were', 'Vikings', 'one', 'Viking', 'couple', 'man', 'woman', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'couple', 'child', 'perished', 'storm', 'could', 'reach', 'island', 'shores', 'Just', 'perished', 'sea', 'cursed', 'island', 'curse', 'being', '50', 'years', 'fish', 'would', 'dry', 'up', 'chosen', 'one', 'apparently', 'young', 'woman', 'sacrificed', 'Was', 'Silly', 'chosen', 'one', 'story', 'ask', 'Was', 'curse', 'real', 'destiny', 'viewer', 'never', 'sure', 'curse', 'real', 'not', 'islanders', 'take', 'seriously', 'outsiders', 'do', 'not', 'are', 'little', 'obvious', 'magical', 'elements', 'two', 'occasions', 'even', 'occasions', 'are', 'open', 'interpretation', '.Really', 'movie', 'accepting', 'loss', 'loved', 'ones', 'moving', 'perhaps', 'dealing', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'story-within-the-story', 'starring', 'Ms.', 'Dunst', 'romance', 'times', 'funny', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'ultimately', 'tragic.I', 'found', 'movie', 'bit', 'somber', 'times', 'moody', 'many', 'scenes', 'quiet', 'people', 'contemplating', 'sea', 'waves', 'crashed', 'shore', 'orchestral', 'music', 'could', 'be', 'heard', 'background', 'story', 'Silly', 'much', 'revolved', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'echoing', 'quieter', 'rebellions', 'grieving', 'Claire', 'present', 'Sometimes', 'found', 'pace', 'bit', 'slow', 'thought', 'well', 'made', 'scenery', 'was', 'beautiful', 'Ms.', 'Dunst', 'good', 'actress', 'generally', 'liked']",Deeply
