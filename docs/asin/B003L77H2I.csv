1353504,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B003L77H2I,Amanda,"[14, 14]","Last summer USA introduced us to sophisticated white collar thief Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer), a con man turned FBI consultant, and FBI Special Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), an agent in the FBI white collar crime division who has dedicated his career to hunting down Neal. After making a deal with the FBI, Neal begins working with Peter on white collar cases, including everything from art theft and forgery to embezzlement. Season one laid the groundwork for this edge-of-your seat show, creating unforgettable characters (especially Willie Garson's quirky Mozzie) and building a white-hot, unique summer show that ended (quite literally) with a bang.At the beginning of season two, Neal is still reeling from ex-girlfriend Kate's unexpected death. Though he returns to his job as an FBI consultant (after a brief stint in prison after cutting his tracking anklet -- again), Neal secretly works to unravel the mystery behind Kate's death. Meanwhile, a concerned Peter meets secretly with Neal's friend and fellow con man Mozzie out of concern for Neal, while still hiding an agenda of his own. Whether it's out of concern for Neal or for the Bureau, Peter begins working with newly reassigned Special Agent Diana Barrigan (Marsha Thomason) outside of business hours on the questions surrounding a strange artifact that was connected to Kate's death.The biggest refresher about season two is the inclusion of Marsha Thomason as Special Agent Diana Barrigan, Peter's trainee and chief point-person to discovering the truth behind Operation Meteor in the first season. Thomason appeared in both the series pilot and season one finale, but was replaced during the remainder of the season by Special Agent Lauren Cruz (Natalie Morales). While Lauren was an interesting character, she often felt stilted and flat, not to mention occasionally extraneous. Whether or not the failure of Lauren's character was due to writing or acting, Diana is a welcome change. She feels much more natural on screen with Peter and Neal and adds a much-needed level of cohesion to the cast, especially in the bureau. Diana is already poised to be a standout character in season two and I'm curious to see what the writers do with her.The rest of the cast is just as strong as before -- perhaps even stronger. Neal and Peter's entertaining old married couple-like bickering flows even more easily, and it feels like both the writers and actors have fully settled into the characters and plot, adding a warm sense of comfort to the show that makes it more accessible. Not to mention that Willie Garson (as Mozzie) continues his show-stopping awesome, stealing the show in nearly each scene (just like in the first season) but somehow manages to improve upon his quirky, whimsical nature in the second season. Oh, and West Beverly Hills High alum Tiffani Theissen returns as Peter's wife Elizabeth. Though I admit it's hard for me not to see the girl from 90210, Theissen holds her own against the other strong characters in the show and plays well off Neal and Mozzie while managing to establish herself as part of the White Collar universe. With such an intriguing group of characters, it's easy to get involved.So far, season two of USA's crime-comedy hit is heating up to be even better than the first. Even if you haven't seen the first season, you can still dive into the intriguing world of white collar crime.",5,Back and even better,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,3390,"['Last', 'summer', 'USA', 'introduced', 'sophisticated', 'white', 'collar', 'thief', 'Neal', 'Caffrey', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'con', 'man', 'turned', 'FBI', 'consultant', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Peter', 'Burke', 'Tim', 'DeKay', 'agent', 'FBI', 'white', 'collar', 'crime', 'division', 'who', 'dedicated', 'career', 'hunting', 'down', 'Neal', 'making', 'deal', 'FBI', 'Neal', 'working', 'Peter', 'white', 'collar', 'cases', 'including', 'everything', 'art', 'theft', 'forgery', 'embezzlement', 'Season', 'one', 'laid', 'groundwork', 'edge-of-your', 'seat', 'show', 'creating', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'especially', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'quirky', 'Mozzie', 'building', 'white-hot', 'unique', 'summer', 'show', 'ended', 'quite', 'literally', 'bang.At', 'beginning', 'season', 'two', 'Neal', 'still', 'reeling', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Kate', 'unexpected', 'death', 'job', 'FBI', 'consultant', 'brief', 'stint', 'prison', 'cutting', 'tracking', 'anklet', 'again', 'Neal', 'secretly', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'Kate', 'death', 'Meanwhile', 'concerned', 'Peter', 'meets', 'secretly', 'Neal', 'friend', 'fellow', 'con', 'man', 'Mozzie', 'concern', 'Neal', 'still', 'hiding', 'agenda', 'own', 'concern', 'Neal', 'Bureau', 'Peter', 'working', 'newly', 'reassigned', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Diana', 'Barrigan', 'Marsha', 'Thomason', 'business', 'hours', 'questions', 'surrounding', 'strange', 'artifact', 'was', 'connected', 'Kate', 'death.The', 'biggest', 'refresher', 'season', 'two', 'inclusion', 'Marsha', 'Thomason', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Diana', 'Barrigan', 'Peter', 'trainee', 'chief', 'point-person', 'discovering', 'truth', 'Operation', 'Meteor', 'first', 'season', 'Thomason', 'appeared', 'series', 'pilot', 'season', 'one', 'finale', 'was', 'replaced', 'remainder', 'season', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Lauren', 'Cruz', 'Natalie', 'Morales', 'Lauren', 'was', 'interesting', 'character', 'often', 'felt', 'stilted', 'flat', 'not', 'mention', 'occasionally', 'extraneous', 'not', 'failure', 'Lauren', 'character', 'was', 'due', 'writing', 'acting', 'Diana', 'welcome', 'change', 'much', 'more', 'natural', 'screen', 'Peter', 'Neal', 'much-needed', 'level', 'cohesion', 'cast', 'especially', 'bureau', 'Diana', 'already', 'poised', 'be', 'standout', 'character', 'season', 'two', ""'m"", 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'writers', 'do', 'her.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'before', 'perhaps', 'even', 'stronger', 'Neal', 'Peter', 'entertaining', 'old', 'married', 'couple-like', 'bickering', 'even', 'more', 'easily', 'writers', 'actors', 'have', 'fully', 'settled', 'characters', 'plot', 'adding', 'warm', 'sense', 'comfort', 'show', 'more', 'accessible', 'Not', 'mention', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'Mozzie', 'show-stopping', 'awesome', 'stealing', 'show', 'nearly', 'scene', 'just', 'first', 'season', 'manages', 'improve', 'quirky', 'whimsical', 'nature', 'second', 'season', 'Oh', 'West', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'High', 'alum', 'Tiffani', 'Theissen', 'Peter', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'admit', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'girl', '90210', 'Theissen', 'own', 'other', 'strong', 'characters', 'show', 'plays', 'well', 'Neal', 'Mozzie', 'managing', 'establish', 'part', 'White', 'Collar', 'universe', 'such', 'intriguing', 'group', 'characters', 'easy', 'get', 'involved.So', 'far', 'season', 'two', 'USA', 'crime-comedy', 'hit', 'heating', 'up', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'Even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'can', 'still', 'dive', 'intriguing', 'world', 'white', 'collar', 'crime']",N/A

So it's not surprising that the former gentleman thief spends ""White Collar Season 2"" searching for whoever killed her, even as he struggles to help Peter with even more elaborate cons, thefts and murders -- as well as an ever-twisting game of trust.Devastated by Kate's death, Neal (Matthew Bomer) goes back to working with Peter (Tim DeKay) and the FBI. But now he isn't just trying to stay out of prison -- he's trying to find out who is responsible for his girlfriend's death, and why she had to die. The secret lies in the mysterious music box that the FBI has in its custody, which holds the key to a long-buried secret.And in the meantime, Neal and Peter solve some very elaborate crimes -- corrupt politicians, bank robbers, a copycat criminal, a disappearing waitress that Mozzie is attracted to, adoption extortions, corporate espionage, FBI corruption, an aging conman, corporate espionage, diplomatic disasters in Burma, an old enemy who has Peter kidnapped, identity-switching to uncover a power company scam, and Peter being framed for a crime he didn't commit...The second season of ""White Collar"" actually feels more like the second half of one reeeeaalllyy long season -- the running subplot of Kate's death and the mysterious music box run all the way through it. Those subplots add a lot of suspense to this season, particularly since we never quite know what the music box is for until the end.The writers maintain a solid balance of solid action and detective work, but they keep an eye on the warmer side of the show -- such as Peter's loving relationship with his wife, or Neal and Diana goofing around in bathrobes. And as always, there's a small but healthy dose of comic relief, mostly from the ever-entertaining Mozzie. He's always doing something strange and/or hilarious (""Hiter clones!"" ""Please tell me he's joking"").The one writing downside is that the writers clumsily shoehorn not one but TWO love interests for Neal at the end of the season. It feels like a forced attempt to have a love triangle.Bomer and DeKay still have great chemistry -- they have that buddy-cop atmosphere, where there's just a little tension and witty sniping to spice things up, but they really are solid friends. Willie Garsona and Tiffany Thiessen round out the main cast very well. And they thankfully got rid of.... whoever the female FBI agent was last season, in favor of the wry, witty Marsha Thomason.""White Collar Season Two"" plays out the various subplots that the first season set up, and introduces some solid new crimes.

1353512,A3A9UCRADPMCT8,B003L77H2I,James Horlan,"[3, 3]","It would be difficult to call Season Two of White Collar an improvement over the first season, but it's a worthy successor at any rate.The overall premise is still the same:  White collar crook (forger, thief, con-man) Neil Caffrey (Matt Bomer) is seconded to the FBI, specifically Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) in lieu of a prison sentence, in order to help catch people Neil.  Burke is assisted by Agents Diana Berrigan (Marsha Thomsen) and Clinton Jones (Sharif Atkins), with Caffrey's main aide being his best friend Mozz (Wilie Garson), and potential new love interest Sara Ellis  (Hilarie Burton), not a con woman yet, but she's getting some pointers.  The season long story arc of the first season, finding Neil's ex-girlfriend Kate (Alexandra Daddario) is now replaced by finding her murderer, a person from their collective pasts.The individual cases were much the same as the previous season, with a bit more jeopardy for both Neil and Peter, and some cases that are more personal in nature for both as well.  There is a flashback episode, which somewhat details how Neil, Kate, Alex (Gloria Votsis), and Mozz all met, and how Peter entered their lives.  It's an episode that could have been a home run but for the horrible acting by Daddario, who I hope was just having a bad week. I don't recall her being bad at all in Percy Jackson, but she was wooden and unconvincing here.  Neil has tons more chemistry with fellow thief Alex, as well as insurance investigator Sara, both of whom are just as attractive as Kate and a lot more lively.  We even get a look into the past of Neil's landlady June (Diahann Carroll), who while she's still too good to be true, is a nice person to have around in an episode.  Garson's Mozz has more to do this season as well, and while he never took over the show, more and more plots became entwined around him.  This isn't a bad thing mind you.  Notable in her early season absence was Peter's wife Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen), but that was due to the actress' pregnancy, which they somewhat successfully managed to hide in the rare moments she was on screen in the first half.  Kind of.Problems?  Eh, none that were really out there, other than Kate and why someone would go to so much trouble to find her, kill her, or find her killer.  The end of the season sets up Season Three (not seen by me) pretty well, though the premise of the show doesn't have that much longer to run, given that Neil's sentence has to run out eventually.  Bomer and DeKay are the heart of the show, and both perform as expected.  Bomer could teach smooth to anyone, and DeKay is a nice contrast in his awkwardness at times.  New addition Burton adds spice to the show, I look forward to more of her next season.All in all a great season, and more than worth the money paid and time spent.  It's a keeper.Five stars",5,No Sophomore Slump Here,1314748800,"08 31, 2011",2011,2839,"['would', 'be', 'difficult', 'call', 'Season', 'Two', 'White', 'Collar', 'improvement', 'first', 'season', 'worthy', 'successor', 'rate.The', 'overall', 'premise', 'still', 'same', 'White', 'collar', 'crook', 'forger', 'thief', 'con-man', 'Neil', 'Caffrey', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'seconded', 'FBI', 'specifically', 'Agent', 'Peter', 'Burke', 'Tim', 'DeKay', 'lieu', 'prison', 'sentence', 'order', 'help', 'catch', 'people', 'Neil', 'Burke', 'assisted', 'Agents', 'Diana', 'Berrigan', 'Marsha', 'Thomsen', 'Clinton', 'Jones', 'Sharif', 'Atkins', 'Caffrey', 'main', 'aide', 'being', 'best', 'friend', 'Mozz', 'Wilie', 'Garson', 'potential', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Sara', 'Ellis', 'Hilarie', 'Burton', 'not', 'con', 'woman', 'yet', 'getting', 'pointers', 'season', 'long', 'story', 'arc', 'first', 'season', 'finding', 'Neil', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Kate', 'Alexandra', 'Daddario', 'now', 'replaced', 'finding', 'murderer', 'person', 'collective', 'pasts.The', 'individual', 'cases', 'were', 'much', 'same', 'previous', 'season', 'bit', 'more', 'jeopardy', 'Neil', 'Peter', 'cases', 'are', 'more', 'personal', 'nature', 'as', 'well', 'flashback', 'episode', 'somewhat', 'details', 'how', 'Neil', 'Kate', 'Alex', 'Gloria', 'Votsis', 'Mozz', 'met', 'how', 'Peter', 'entered', 'lives', 'episode', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'home', 'run', 'horrible', 'acting', 'Daddario', 'who', 'hope', 'was', 'just', 'having', 'bad', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'being', 'bad', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'was', 'wooden', 'unconvincing', 'here', 'Neil', 'tons', 'more', 'chemistry', 'fellow', 'thief', 'Alex', 'as', 'well', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'Sara', 'whom', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'attractive', 'Kate', 'lot', 'more', 'lively', 'even', 'get', 'look', 'past', 'Neil', 'landlady', 'June', 'Diahann', 'Carroll', 'who', 'still', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'nice', 'person', 'have', 'around', 'episode', 'Garson', 'Mozz', 'more', 'do', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'took', 'show', 'more', 'more', 'plots', 'became', 'entwined', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'mind', 'Notable', 'early', 'season', 'absence', 'was', 'Peter', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Tiffani', 'Thiessen', 'was', 'due', 'actress', 'pregnancy', 'somewhat', 'successfully', 'managed', 'hide', 'rare', 'moments', 'was', 'screen', 'first', 'half', 'Kind', 'Eh', 'none', 'were', 'really', 'there', 'other', 'Kate', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'find', 'kill', 'find', 'killer', 'end', 'season', 'up', 'Season', 'Three', 'not', 'seen', 'pretty', 'well', 'premise', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'longer', 'run', 'given', 'Neil', 'sentence', 'run', 'out', 'eventually', 'Bomer', 'DeKay', 'are', 'heart', 'show', 'perform', 'expected', 'Bomer', 'could', 'teach', 'smooth', 'anyone', 'DeKay', 'nice', 'contrast', 'awkwardness', 'times', 'New', 'addition', 'Burton', 'spice', 'show', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'next', 'season.All', 'great', 'season', 'more', 'money', 'paid', 'time', 'spent', 'keeper.Five', 'stars']",N/A

It is very hard to keep up the quality when writers must come up with new scams etc. that aren't repetitive or just plain lacking in pizazz. This show thrives on charisma--first season had many more winning episodes than losing, but still inconsistent. Second season is less entertaining and lacks pizazz. When wife is on screen, everything drops many degrees, farenheit or celsius.  She is poor actress to begin with, but there is no way that she can handle a business. Her lovey-dovey relationship with Peter (much better actor) is 90/100 on nausea meter. After watching first season, I was impressed by the actor who plays Peter, but I was conned. In this season, unless Neil or Moss (sp?) is on the screen, everything, well lets repeat ourselves, drops in quality and charisma--a necessary element for this kind of show. Willie Garson is a great, underused actor who lights up the screen whenever he's on it. The dead opposite of wifey.  Also, Neil suffers from inconsistent plots. writing, themes, and lack of lovers. Bring em on. The only thing that could save this show is getting real. Dreamboat Neil needs to get the girls, which he would get in real life. Make him more of a George Clooney and James Garner and less of a terribly good looking, prissy model who seems to be struggling with his lines. Garson played a gay in Sex and the City.

1353522,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003L77H2I,Mark Turner,"[2, 2]","Last year USA Network rolled out another series that was on the fantastic end instead of the here we go again side. That series was WHITE COLLAR and I talked when the first season came out about how great it was, how the cast worked, the stories worked, etc. The fact is that with season two now out on DVD you can discover just how much better it got and catch up as season three begins.As with my review for BURN  NOTICE SEASON FOUR, here's a refresher for those who haven't seen the show: Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) is the ultimate con man and a gent who seems to always find a way out of trouble. In prison and placed there by FBI agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), Caffrey attempts to escape but fails, caught once more by Burke. But there was a reason why Caffrey, so close to being released, attempted that escape. He talks to Burke and gives him a part of the reason, his girlfriend has disappeared and he's concerned about her. Burke gets Caffrey a work release deal that has him wearing an  ankle tracker and as long as he co-operates assisting the FBI on other cases, Burke will help him with his problem as well. By the end of season one, Caffrey's girlfriend Kate was blown to pieces in a plane explosion that he was set to be on as well.Season two begins with Caffrey trying to find out who was behind the whole situation we saw him in in season one. Along with his best friend and fellow con artist Mozzie (Willie Garson), Caffrey follows the clues to this puzzle while at the same time assisting Burke take down white collar criminals for the FBI. One major piece that comes into play here is a music box that Caffrey comes into possession of. He may have the box but Peter has the key to the mystery that will reveal just why it is so important. And that information will lead to the biggest case the pair have ever worked on and the possible killer of Kate.Other cast members that come into play throughout the series include Tiffani Theissen as Peter's devoted wife Elizabeth, a woman that Neal becomes close with, a friend he never really had. But the same holds true for Peter as well. While the pair has been at opposite ends of the criminal world throughout most of their careers, there is a certain amount of respect they share for one another. And as they solve each new case, the bond of friendship between the two builds. But all of that may dissolve by the end of the season as each one plays out their own search for the answers to their important question, never quite knowing if they can trust the other.The thing that makes this show click is, to start with, the ensemble they've collected to play these roles. Not only that, the characters themselves makes the show not just fun to watch but interesting as well. So many times we are presented with characters that you either care for to much or don't care for at all. Here you worry about each, you care about them all and you root for not only the good guy but the bad guys too. Well at least some of the bad guys.Each of the actors is perfectly suited for their role. Bomer exudes the confidence that a con man needs, easily fitting into an upper crust society while being from a low level life. DeKay not only looks, feels and sounds like an FBI agent, he comes off as a man who wants to accomplish his job but at the same time has a heart as well. And Garson as Mozzie is a treat. Smart, paranoid and quirky, he completes the main trio of male roles that forms a bond that just works.If you take the chance with this series, you'll find yourself drawn in not just by the weekly cases they have to solve, great writing and shows in their own right, but also drawn into the whole mystery that began with the very first episode ever. This is a well crafted series that will hold your interest better than most offerings on TV these days.

1353542,A1Z0CR9O2SLSH0,B003L77H2I,Starfire,"[7, 7]","which strikes me as odd because the strength of this series is the relationship between Matt Bomer's Neal Caffrey and DeKay's Peter Burke. The vagaries of marketing aside, this is, for my money, the best series on television right now. Willie Garson plays Neal's eccentric friend Mozzie and Tiffani Thiessen is Peter's wife Elizabeth. Cleverly written with a very strong cast, season two opens with conman/thief Caffrey back in prison and FBI agent Burke fighting to get him released again - and get himself reinstated back at the FBI. It's a tall order but everything moves fast in White Collar and this is no exception.Season Two is chock full of really good episodes, some of which seem more like you're watching a movie other than a modestly budgeted TV series. There was only episode I really didn't like; the retrospective Forging Bonds, which pretty much threw the series timeline to the wind, odd for a show that usually keeps to a very strict line. We see how Neal meet Moz and together they picked a dubious target, the mysterious Trump like financier Vincent Adler (Andrew McCarthy). Neal also met his great love Kate, the thief/fence Alex Hunter and, to his dismay, ended up on the radar of FBI Agent Burke. This episode was weak and a rarity, almost dull in places. But it's the only one, folks. The rest are solid or top drawer.My favorites: Withdrawal (season opener, see above); By the Book, a Mozzie episode that is by turns humorous and dangerous. Prisoner's Dilemma, a turnaround where Peter is forced to go on the run with a rogue FBI agent while Neal tries to cover at the FBI for him. Company Man, a rare look at Peter's life choices and talents when he and Neal go undercover at a high tech company. It has a near deadly twist at the end. Burke's Seven, the mid season opener that finds the entire gang looking for Mozzie's shooter and then things get even more interesting with Peter on suspension for evidence tampering. The elaborate con Neal and Peter put together trying to right the wrongs is fascinating to watch. My personal favorite is Payback. Neal's odious arch enemy, Matthew Keller, is back again, this time with a new mission, get himself out of prison and make Neal pay for his triumph in last season's episode Bottlenecked. Keller ups the ante this time though but having an associate kidnap Agent Burke. A tense, fast moving episode that concludes with my favorite scene, Neal on the phone to an imprisoned Peter, who has partially freed himself,  trying to 'talk him through a jailbreak'. Excellent episode.This DVD set lacks all the opulent extras the first season had, to my disappointment but the price is significantly lower. The White Collar cast is one of the few though that I actually do listen to the commentaries and we only have three, none of them on the really strong episodes. (Go figure) You do get a gag reel though (again, funny although not as long as season 1)and a rather long commercial for Burn Notice/White Collar, where the show's creators and writers roast/compliment each other. Its okay but nothing I would have paid for though. Also, something called Slick Willie (I'm assuming Garson) but I have not watched it yet.All in all, I highly recommend White Collar. I only started watching the show a couple episodes in on season two and I'm hooked. It is one of the few shows on television that the writing is not predictable and the acting is superb. Try it; I really doubt that you'll be disappointed.",5,Best partnership show on but still no Tim DeKay on the cover ?,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,3468,"['odd', 'strength', 'series', 'relationship', 'Matt', 'Bomer', 'Neal', 'Caffrey', 'DeKay', 'Peter', 'Burke', 'vagaries', 'marketing', 'aside', 'money', 'best', 'series', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'Neal', 'eccentric', 'friend', 'Mozzie', 'Tiffani', 'Thiessen', 'Peter', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Cleverly', 'written', 'very', 'strong', 'cast', 'season', 'two', 'opens', 'conman/thief', 'Caffrey', 'back', 'prison', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Burke', 'fighting', 'get', 'released', 'again', 'get', 'reinstated', 'back', 'FBI', 'tall', 'order', 'everything', 'moves', 'fast', 'White', 'Collar', 'exception.Season', 'Two', 'chock', 'full', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'seem', 'more', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'other', 'modestly', 'budgeted', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'only', 'episode', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'retrospective', 'Forging', 'Bonds', 'pretty', 'much', 'threw', 'series', 'timeline', 'wind', 'odd', 'show', 'usually', 'very', 'strict', 'line', 'see', 'how', 'Neal', 'meet', 'Moz', 'together', 'picked', 'dubious', 'target', 'mysterious', 'Trump', 'financier', 'Vincent', 'Adler', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'Neal', 'also', 'met', 'great', 'love', 'Kate', 'thief/fence', 'Alex', 'Hunter', 'dismay', 'ended', 'up', 'radar', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Burke', 'episode', 'was', 'weak', 'rarity', 'almost', 'dull', 'places', 'only', 'one', 'folks', 'rest', 'are', 'solid', 'top', 'drawer.My', 'favorites', 'Withdrawal', 'season', 'opener', 'see', 'Book', 'Mozzie', 'episode', 'turns', 'humorous', 'dangerous', 'Prisoner', 'Dilemma', 'turnaround', 'where', 'Peter', 'forced', 'go', 'run', 'rogue', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Neal', 'tries', 'cover', 'FBI', 'Company', 'Man', 'rare', 'look', 'Peter', 'life', 'choices', 'talents', 'when', 'Neal', 'go', 'undercover', 'high', 'tech', 'company', 'near', 'deadly', 'twist', 'end', 'Burke', 'Seven', 'mid', 'season', 'opener', 'entire', 'gang', 'looking', 'Mozzie', 'shooter', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'Peter', 'suspension', 'evidence', 'tampering', 'elaborate', 'con', 'Neal', 'Peter', 'put', 'together', 'trying', 'right', 'wrongs', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'My', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Payback', 'Neal', 'odious', 'arch', 'enemy', 'Matthew', 'Keller', 'back', 'again', 'time', 'new', 'mission', 'get', 'prison', 'make', 'Neal', 'pay', 'triumph', 'last', 'season', 'episode', 'Bottlenecked', 'Keller', 'ante', 'time', 'having', 'associate', 'kidnap', 'Agent', 'Burke', 'A', 'tense', 'fast', 'moving', 'episode', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Neal', 'phone', 'imprisoned', 'Peter', 'who', 'partially', 'freed', 'trying', ""'talk"", 'jailbreak', 'Excellent', 'episode.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'opulent', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'disappointment', 'price', 'significantly', 'lower', 'White', 'Collar', 'cast', 'one', 'few', 'actually', 'do', 'listen', 'commentaries', 'only', 'have', 'three', 'none', 'really', 'strong', 'episodes', 'Go', 'figure', 'do', 'get', 'gag', 'reel', 'again', 'funny', 'not', 'as', 'long', 'season', '1', 'rather', 'long', 'commercial', 'Burn', 'Notice/White', 'Collar', 'where', 'show', 'creators', 'writers', 'roast/compliment', 'other', 'okay', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'though', 'Also', 'something', 'called', 'Slick', 'Willie', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'Garson', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'highly', 'recommend', 'White', 'Collar', 'only', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'couple', 'season', 'two', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'television', 'writing', 'not', 'predictable', 'acting', 'superb', 'Try', 'really', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
