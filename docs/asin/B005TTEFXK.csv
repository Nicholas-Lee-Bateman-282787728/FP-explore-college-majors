We both saw over 10 films, some were pretty terrible but both this one and Trollhunter rocked! This film didn't win the audience award at Newport for no reason.Everything about this film was strong. Story, Cinematography, Dialogue, Character, Music, Acting, etc etc.Except for one supporting actor.He comes into the film early on as the best friend of our protagonist. They're both deaf and he serves as a mentor to deaf culture. His name is Jay, as played by Michael Anthony Spady.Tell me already, was he bad or good?He's beyond good. I have never seen a more charismatic performance in any film since Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption.",5,Great film for the whole family!,1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,744,"['film', 'was', 'favorite', 'film', 'Newport', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'also', 'girlfriend', 'favorite', 'saw', '10', 'films', 'were', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'one', 'Trollhunter', 'rocked', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'audience', 'award', 'Newport', 'reason.Everything', 'film', 'was', 'strong', 'Story', 'Cinematography', 'Dialogue', 'Character', 'Music', 'Acting', 'etc', 'etc.Except', 'one', 'supporting', 'actor.He', 'film', 'early', 'best', 'friend', 'protagonist', ""'re"", 'deaf', 'mentor', 'deaf', 'culture', 'name', 'Jay', 'played', 'Michael', 'Anthony', 'Spady.Tell', 'already', 'was', 'bad', 'good', 'good', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'more', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption']",The Hammer
