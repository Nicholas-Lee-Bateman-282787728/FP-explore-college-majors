Andre,"[2, 2]","death bed will likely generate more blank stares than laughs, such as when the bed eats an apple and spits it back to the surface as just a core (or even when it downs a bottle of pepto). and it's not likely that it will give you the chills either, such as when a moment later the bed consumes two lovers. you may chuckle to yourself here and there but ultimately this film is a curiosity piece. anyone who sees this will have to wonder, ""and they thought this was a GOOD idea???"" in fact the director was unable to sell the movie at all and it disappeared into obscurity until the dvd format began resurrecting every film possible, including this oddball.it's an amateurish production but not neccessarily ""bad"". Death Bed actually has its moments. Some of the digestion shots are interesting visually. the entity trapped behind the painting on the wall is gothic and cryptic. it's also filled with lots of voice over to express characters inner monologues and even the entity has alot to say. these moments and about half of the dialogue in general is just flat out bizarre. the film in general is capable of putting the viewer in a warped head space.Death Bed is entertaining and can be very interesting if you can set logic aside for the entire 80 min runtime. probably best if viewed by a few people rather than a lone sitting. if you're a collector or an open minded viewer than i'd say grab a copy. extras are limited to a video intro by the director and an insert with liner notes. the transfer is actually decent considering what Cult Epics was working with. the cover art of the dvd is very nice to. i rated this one star above average because it sets itself apart from the norm while maintaining a fairly coherent story line...also for the fact that it's just strange strange strange!",4,fails as a comedy and fails as a horror film but succeeds as a really weird movie,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,1795,"['death', 'bed', 'will', 'likely', 'generate', 'more', 'blank', 'stares', 'laughs', 'such', 'when', 'bed', 'apple', 'back', 'surface', 'just', 'core', 'even', 'when', 'bottle', 'pepto', 'not', 'likely', 'will', 'give', 'chills', 'such', 'when', 'moment', 'later', 'bed', 'two', 'lovers', 'may', 'chuckle', 'here', 'there', 'ultimately', 'film', 'curiosity', 'piece', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'wonder', 'thought', 'was', 'GOOD', 'idea', 'fact', 'director', 'was', 'unable', 'sell', 'movie', 'disappeared', 'obscurity', 'dvd', 'format', 'began', 'resurrecting', 'film', 'possible', 'including', 'oddball.it', 'amateurish', 'production', 'not', 'neccessarily', 'bad', 'Death', 'Bed', 'actually', 'moments', 'digestion', 'shots', 'are', 'interesting', 'visually', 'entity', 'trapped', 'painting', 'wall', 'gothic', 'cryptic', 'also', 'filled', 'lots', 'voice', 'express', 'characters', 'inner', 'monologues', 'even', 'entity', 'alot', 'say', 'moments', 'half', 'dialogue', 'general', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'bizarre', 'film', 'general', 'capable', 'putting', 'viewer', 'warped', 'head', 'space.Death', 'Bed', 'entertaining', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'can', 'set', 'logic', 'aside', 'entire', '80', 'min', 'runtime', 'probably', 'best', 'viewed', 'few', 'people', 'rather', 'lone', 'sitting', ""'re"", 'collector', 'open', 'minded', 'viewer', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'grab', 'copy', 'extras', 'are', 'limited', 'video', 'intro', 'director', 'insert', 'liner', 'notes', 'transfer', 'actually', 'decent', 'considering', 'what', 'Cult', 'Epics', 'was', 'working', 'cover', 'art', 'dvd', 'very', 'nice', 'i', 'rated', 'one', 'star', 'average', 'apart', 'norm', 'maintaining', 'fairly', 'coherent', 'story', 'line', 'also', 'fact', 'just', 'strange', 'strange', 'strange']",N/A
776023,A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ,B0000CEB56,Blahblahblah,"[4, 5]","I watched this film expecting something silly, but it turned out to be a very accomplished film.  Taking a very bizarre concept (a bed that eats people), the director has managed to make a film filled with David Lynchesque surrealism that is equally intentionally humourous and frightening.  The effects showing how the bed eats are very well done.The movie (largely seen through the eyes of the ghost of Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde's favourite illustrator) is divided into three sections: Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.  The first part sets up the fact that the bed eats people as a couple stumble upon it.  The second part, also taking place in the &quot;present&quot; shows another group of friends coming upon the bed.  Scenes of these new visitors falling victim to it one at a time are intercut with scenes of the bed's history and its origins.  The bed, despite its immobility, manages to kill each victim with far more imagaination than the average movie serial killer.  The third section deals with the final fates of the bed and the film's heroes.Unfortunately, after watching the film once, all the surprises are gone, and the dreamlike pacing of it then becomes a negative instead of a positive.  Despite this, I have no hesitation in recommending that this film be watched at least once.The extras include the director explaining how this film became &quot;lost&quot;, illustrating how dirty the film distribution business can be.  If he had been able to release it in the early 1970s like he intended, this film would have been a classic, instead of something seen by only a few people with access to pirated copies.",4,Surpisingly Good,1077408000,"02 22, 2004",2004,1630,"['watched', 'film', 'expecting', 'something', 'silly', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'accomplished', 'film', 'Taking', 'very', 'bizarre', 'concept', 'bed', 'people', 'director', 'managed', 'make', 'film', 'filled', 'David', 'Lynchesque', 'surrealism', 'equally', 'intentionally', 'humourous', 'frightening', 'effects', 'showing', 'how', 'bed', 'eats', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done.The', 'movie', 'largely', 'seen', 'eyes', 'ghost', 'Aubrey', 'Beardsley', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'favourite', 'illustrator', 'divided', 'three', 'sections', 'Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'first', 'part', 'up', 'fact', 'bed', 'people', 'couple', 'stumble', 'second', 'part', 'also', 'taking', 'place', 'quot', 'present', 'quot', 'group', 'friends', 'coming', 'bed', 'Scenes', 'new', 'visitors', 'falling', 'victim', 'one', 'time', 'are', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'bed', 'history', 'origins', 'bed', 'immobility', 'kill', 'victim', 'far', 'more', 'imagaination', 'average', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'third', 'section', 'deals', 'final', 'fates', 'bed', 'film', 'heroes.Unfortunately', 'watching', 'film', 'once', 'surprises', 'are', 'gone', 'dreamlike', 'pacing', 'then', 'negative', 'instead', 'positive', 'have', 'hesitation', 'recommending', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'least', 'once.The', 'extras', 'include', 'director', 'explaining', 'how', 'film', 'became', 'quot', 'lost', 'quot', 'illustrating', 'how', 'dirty', 'film', 'distribution', 'business', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'release', 'early', '1970s', 'intended', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'instead', 'something', 'seen', 'only', 'few', 'people', 'access', 'pirated', 'copies']",N/A

776025,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0000CEB56,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 6]","Death Bed - The Bed That Eats - it sounds like something a second-grader would write, doesn't it?  Obviously, this is not your typical horror film.  The title alone compelled me to watch the film, and what I discovered is a sort of mystery.  There's nothing mysterious about the film, really; the mystery comes in the reactions other people have had to this long-lost film of the 1970s.  Some treat the film as some macabre work of art, expound upon supposedly enlightening fairy tale elements of the story and presentation, play up the erotic nature of the theme, and comment on the macabre humor underlying such a rich presentation.  Folks, I won't lie to you - I didn't see any of that stuff in this film.  It's a bed, and it eats people - that's about all there is, except for the increasingly weird story of the bed's creation and ultimate destruction.We find this huge, ornate, hungry bed inside an old stone grotto somewhere on an abandoned estate.  No one comes here anymore - apparently a slew of missing persons in that locale scared everyone away long ago, so the bed sleeps (and snores and makes other disturbing man-like sounds).  Then an amorous couple shows up, only to find out that they were looking for love in all the wrong places.  That's Breakfast.  Lunch and Dinner come in the form of a trio of young women who have decided to drive out to the middle of nowhere for no apparent reason.  One of the girls disturbs, even scares, the bed, and this leads us into a discussion of the bed's origins.  Of course, the bed can't speak for itself; fortunately, decades ago it trapped the spirit of an artist who painted the bed while he was lying in it dying of consumption.  Let me tell you, this bed got around in its younger days, even serving at one time as the central element in an outdoor ""sexual rejuvenator"" scheme.I won't tell you how the bed actually eats its victims, nor will I explain the really weird story of its origins - I don't want to take away what little fun you might have with this weird little film.  There is a little blood and gore involved, but none of it is very graphic in nature.  In my opinion, this really isn't a very good film.  Some viewers may talk about some sort of Death Bed epiphany, but I didn't take much of anything away from this cinematic experience.The story of the film is an unusual one, though.  A college student named George Barry made this film in the early 1970s on 16mm color film; he finally finished it in 1977, but he was not able to generate any interest in distributing it.  Without Barry's knowledge, however, a pirated version of the film found its way into the market in the late 1980s; he only learned about this - accidentally - in 2002.  Now the film has been released properly, giving credit where credit is due, as a Lost Horror Film of the Seventies.  This is all well and good, but in my opinion Death Bed just isn't a very good horror movie.",2,"Gives new meaning to the term ""midnight snack""",1095379200,"09 17, 2004",2004,2925,"['Death', 'Bed', 'Bed', 'Eats', 'something', 'second-grader', 'would', 'write', ""n't"", 'Obviously', 'not', 'typical', 'horror', 'film', 'title', 'alone', 'compelled', 'watch', 'film', 'what', 'discovered', 'sort', 'mystery', 'nothing', 'mysterious', 'film', 'really', 'mystery', 'reactions', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'had', 'long-lost', 'film', '1970s', 'treat', 'film', 'macabre', 'work', 'art', 'expound', 'supposedly', 'enlightening', 'fairy', 'tale', 'elements', 'story', 'presentation', 'play', 'up', 'erotic', 'nature', 'theme', 'comment', 'macabre', 'humor', 'underlying', 'such', 'rich', 'presentation', 'Folks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'stuff', 'film', 'bed', 'people', 'increasingly', 'weird', 'story', 'bed', 'creation', 'ultimate', 'destruction.We', 'find', 'huge', 'ornate', 'hungry', 'bed', 'old', 'stone', 'grotto', 'somewhere', 'abandoned', 'estate', 'one', 'here', 'anymore', 'apparently', 'slew', 'missing', 'persons', 'locale', 'scared', 'everyone', 'away', 'long', 'ago', 'bed', 'sleeps', 'snores', 'other', 'disturbing', 'man-like', 'sounds', 'Then', 'amorous', 'couple', 'up', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'were', 'looking', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'come', 'form', 'trio', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'decided', 'drive', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'apparent', 'reason', 'One', 'girls', 'disturbs', 'even', 'scares', 'bed', 'discussion', 'bed', 'origins', 'course', 'bed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'fortunately', 'decades', 'trapped', 'spirit', 'artist', 'who', 'painted', 'bed', 'was', 'lying', 'dying', 'consumption', 'Let', 'tell', 'bed', 'got', 'around', 'younger', 'days', 'even', 'serving', 'one', 'time', 'central', 'element', 'outdoor', 'sexual', 'rejuvenator', 'scheme.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'bed', 'actually', 'victims', 'will', 'explain', 'really', 'weird', 'story', 'origins', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'away', 'what', 'little', 'fun', 'might', 'have', 'weird', 'little', 'film', 'little', 'blood', 'gore', 'involved', 'none', 'very', 'graphic', 'nature', 'opinion', 'really', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'film', 'viewers', 'may', 'talk', 'sort', 'Death', 'Bed', 'epiphany', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'anything', 'away', 'cinematic', 'experience.The', 'story', 'film', 'unusual', 'one', 'though', 'college', 'student', 'named', 'George', 'Barry', 'made', 'film', 'early', '1970s', '16mm', 'color', 'film', 'finally', 'finished', '1977', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'generate', 'interest', 'distributing', 'Barry', 'knowledge', 'however', 'pirated', 'version', 'film', 'found', 'way', 'market', 'late', '1980s', 'only', 'learned', 'accidentally', '2002', 'Now', 'film', 'been', 'released', 'properly', 'giving', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'Lost', 'Horror', 'Film', 'Seventies', 'well', 'good', 'opinion', 'Death', 'Bed', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'horror', 'movie']",N/A
776026,A1EGZYG8PC51U5,B0000CEB56,"D. Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[4, 4]","The title of this little known gem from the 1970's says it all; ""Death Bed: The Bed That Eats!""  What more do you really want to know?  The answer to that question is probably everything, although I really feel that you'll get more out of this movie flying blind, but I'll give it a shot...  the story centers around a demonic bed that well, ahem, ""eats"" anyone who makes the mistake of laying in it.  Helping to move the tale along is the narrative of the spirit of an artist, trapped behind one of his own paintings hanging near the bed.  Enter a number of unsuspecting victims AND a cockamamie way of defeating the evil munching mattress(when the demon that created it falls asleep, the bed losses it's invulnerability... but this only happens once every ten years... also the spirit behind the picture can talk then too... also... you get the idea LOL!) and you've got a movie!  Now I wouldn't go as far as to say that this is a ""lost classic"" of the genre, BUT Death Bed: The Bed That Eats is most certainly an entertaining and original entry to be sure.  The film plays more like a macabre fairy tale than an actual horror film(kinda had the feel of Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural) with a surreal and dreamlike quality running throughout it.  Some excellent effects(take into consideration this is the 70's and they're attempting to make a bed devouring people look real) and the ability to switch from serious to playful(a scene in which the bed eats a bottle of Pepto Bismo after a meal comes to mind) all help to make the movie an enjoyable time waster.  In the end, Death Bed: The Bed That Eats won't work for everyone, even horror fans may struggle with the bizarre and at times plodding nature of the film... but for those in search of originality and the throwback feel of 70's DIY cinema, Death Bed delivers.  Thanks to fellow Amazon reviewer Mike Liddell for the recommendation on this and a big congratulations on his recent marriage(hope she likes horror Mike!).",3,So ya say the bed eats huh?

The bed has a pool of digestive juices with blood that can swallow anything without soiling the sheets and it can bring an artist back as a ghost, paint his fingernails black and imprison him behind a painting.

The narration of a Limbo-bound spirit reveals that the bed in this house is alive and that he's been listening to it snore for a century.  But, once awakened, it strategically locks all of the doors to the house except for the one that leads the amorous couple to its bedroom lair.  Most likely taking offense to the boyfriend's clumsily amateur breast-fondling technique, the bed spitefully eats the young couple's lunch...and then eats them.It seems that these first two victims serve no more purpose than to let viewers know what they're in for...a movie about a bed that eats people.  Our narrating spirit gives us a little history about the bed, its loud munching sounds, and its generally dim wit.  Now that we've set the stage, it's time to meet our next victims which include William Russ (the dad from Boy Meets World) in his FIRST ROLE EVER!This was directed, written and produced by George Barry, who has never done anything else.  The same goes for almost every other actor in this except for William Russ.  Probably for the best.  The effects were poor, the acting was destitute, the scoring was terrible, and the film editing was somehow yet worse.  Following suit was the overly informative, dry, ill-timed narration.  Oh, and we get some narrative from one of the victims as well.  Although I have no clue why.  It serves little purpose other than stacking more poor qualities which disrupt the film's pacing.  All in all, this movie feels like a series of fragmented thoughts, punctuated by nudity, that never go anywhere and which frankly are no more comprehensible than the mutterings of a mad man.The one thing this film has going for it is that it is deliberately funny, for example depicting the bed eating Pepto-Bismol after a meal of a homely naked girl.  The effects are largely limited to the bed drooling yellow foam and digesting things in a prop department fish tank.  My favorite scene had to be when the bed ate William Russ' hands to the bone.  Basically every scene in this movie labors on much longer than is necessary, and only to its hysterical detriment.Simply put, this is the story of a waterbed filled with digestive fluid and powered by a demon that uses telekinesis on its more feisty victims.A must see for those who claim to have seen a little of everything.",3,"Simply put, this is the story of a waterbed filled with digestive fluid and powered by a demon.

She is having a nightmare in the ominous bed born from a demons blood.  As she sleeps her cross necklace slowly and patiently begins to saw away at her throat before the bed will devour her body and plant roses in her skull for her unknowing friends to pick.  In the chamber a victim's ghost from this evil narrates this twisted macabre story while trapped behind his own painting.That is just one of many such sequences in writer, producer, director George Barry's twisted, weird, and extremely creative only film.  Death bed plays like an evil and Gothic fairytale, filled with dreamlike images and eerie effective sets.I would imagine Wes Craven's classicA Nightmare on Elm Street (Infinifilm Edition)was greatly influenced by the film, from a bed getting into your dreams that wants nothing but to kill you.  The bed is also a sadist as the tortured spirit of our narrator points out, taking pleasure in tormenting It's victims before finally devouring them.The acting is pretty bad but that adds to the moments of dark comedy such as the bed drinking pepto bismal after eating a young girl.The scenes of a black screen with the titles Breakfast or Dinner in white letters across the screen reminded me of the seasons spelled on screen duringThe Shining [Blu-ray] minus the eerie music.  It made me think of something an amateur Kubrick would make on an extremely low budget and perhaps while under the influence of mind altering drugs.I heard about this diamond in the rough in Stephen Thrower's bookNightmare, USA: The Untold Story of the Exploitation Independents(also very highly recommended) who has a write up on the dvd jacket and gives this and a few other ""exploitation independents"" the reason to continue to search through tons of bad obscure films in hopes of finding something like this.I have to say the concept is so good and the budget low that I could see this possibly warranting a remake although this original is bordering on bizarre horror masterpiece in It's own right.  This is a must add to your horror dvd collection to give it some diversity and even if you don't like the movie look at it this way:  You have a movie called Death Bed The Bed That Eats, that's worth it alone.DVD SPECIAL FEATURES (FROM THE BACK OF THE DVD)New Transfer from original 16mm Print4 Page Liner NotesVideo Introduction by the DirectorUnrated, Uncensored Version.",5,[4.5]  A creative horror film.

776033,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000CEB56,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 9]","Death Bed: The Bed that Eats (George Barry, 2003)Less than ten minutes into George Barry's Death Bed, which is arguably the single worst movie ever made, I was already nauseous. Not because of the terrible gore effects, but because I was laughing so very hard. And things only got worse--or better, depending on your perspective--from there. This is a movie so insanely awful that no one would release it for two decades after its completion, and according to the DVD extras, Barry seems to have even forgotten he made it (despite never having made another film; you'd think having completed one would stick in your mind, no?). But it is one of those movies that transcends the realms of the quotidian bad into something so entirely horrendous that it achieves a kind of greatness. It's so bad that ""bad"" quails in fear at the mention of Death Bed: The Bed That Eats. And rightly so.Plot: there's this bed, see. And it eats people.Okay, there's a bit more to it than that. The bed is in an abandoned mansion in the middle of nowhere, sitting in a room which also contains a painting haunted by the ghost of someone whom we're not supposed to realize, I don't think, is Aubrey Beardsley. The ghost hates the bed, though there are times when we're supposed to think (I think) that the ghost is the spirit that inhabits the bed. In any case, there's a long, dull, rather incomprehensible story, related by the ghost about two-thirds of the way through the film, about how the bed came to be a bed that eats people. Which it does, by the way, by secreting something that looks like orange soda over them and dissolving them. (It can do this with other things, too, which makes for some unintentionally hysterical moments; who knew that acid had such well-defined teeth when eating a fried chicken leg, for example?) Yes, folks, this is genius at work.The acting, as is to be expected, is atrocious; I have no idea which gangster is which, but keep an ear on the guy with the mustache when he first notices there's something strange about the bed. It's probably the funniest line I've heard in a movie in weeks. Unintentionally, of course. I've never heard an expression of horror delivered in quite that deadpan before. The direction is similarly horrible. The effects? Orange soda, people. The script is brutal, the sound mix seems to have been accomplished with yards of cotton batting. There is nothing whatsoever to recommend this movie. And yet, somehow, if you start watching it, you will not be able to look away. You'll wonder just how much worse it can get, and it will reward you every time. I can't recommend this by any stretch of the imagination, and yet still, you've got to see it just to confirm that, yes, someone can spend five years making a movie and still have it come out looking, sounding, feeling, and tasting like Death Bed: The Bed That Eats. *",1,I continue to be amazed you can see the sets through the copious pot smoke that must have pervaded the air.,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,2866,"['Death', 'Bed', 'Bed', 'Eats', 'George', 'Barry', '2003', 'Less', 'ten', 'minutes', 'George', 'Barry', 'Death', 'Bed', 'arguably', 'single', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'already', 'nauseous', 'Not', 'terrible', 'gore', 'effects', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'very', 'hard', 'things', 'only', 'got', 'worse', 'better', 'depending', 'perspective', 'there', 'movie', 'so', 'insanely', 'awful', 'one', 'would', 'release', 'two', 'decades', 'completion', 'according', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Barry', 'have', 'even', 'forgotten', 'made', 'never', 'having', 'made', 'film', ""'d"", 'think', 'having', 'completed', 'one', 'would', 'stick', 'mind', 'one', 'movies', 'realms', 'quotidian', 'bad', 'something', 'so', 'entirely', 'horrendous', 'kind', 'greatness', 'so', 'bad', 'bad', 'quails', 'fear', 'mention', 'Death', 'Bed', 'Bed', 'Eats', 'rightly', 'so.Plot', 'bed', 'see', 'people.Okay', 'bit', 'more', 'bed', 'abandoned', 'mansion', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'sitting', 'room', 'also', 'painting', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'someone', 'whom', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'realize', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Aubrey', 'Beardsley', 'ghost', 'bed', 'are', 'times', 'when', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'think', 'ghost', 'spirit', 'bed', 'case', 'long', 'dull', 'rather', 'incomprehensible', 'story', 'related', 'ghost', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'film', 'how', 'bed', 'came', 'be', 'bed', 'people', 'way', 'secreting', 'something', 'orange', 'soda', 'dissolving', 'can', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'too', 'unintentionally', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'who', 'knew', 'acid', 'had', 'such', 'well-defined', 'teeth', 'when', 'eating', 'fried', 'chicken', 'leg', 'example', 'Yes', 'folks', 'genius', 'work.The', 'acting', 'be', 'expected', 'atrocious', 'have', 'idea', 'gangster', 'keep', 'ear', 'guy', 'mustache', 'when', 'first', 'something', 'strange', 'bed', 'probably', 'funniest', 'line', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', 'weeks', 'Unintentionally', 'course', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'expression', 'horror', 'delivered', 'quite', 'deadpan', 'direction', 'similarly', 'horrible', 'effects', 'Orange', 'soda', 'people', 'script', 'brutal', 'sound', 'mix', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'yards', 'cotton', 'batting', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'recommend', 'movie', 'yet', 'somehow', 'start', 'watching', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'away', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'worse', 'can', 'get', 'will', 'reward', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'yet', 'still', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'just', 'confirm', 'yes', 'someone', 'can', 'spend', 'five', 'years', 'making', 'movie', 'still', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'looking', 'sounding', 'feeling', 'tasting', 'Death', 'Bed', 'Bed', 'Eats', '*']",N/A

These things beg to be collected, and it is the horror genre where I seem to be spending most of my efforts and cash.  Most of the time I buy DVDs where I've previously seen the movie, but perhaps a third of the time I'm buying based on the favorable reviews given on Amazon, particularly where key words, phrases or concepts are mentioned by the reviewer which I find appealing.The key words, phrases, concepts for ""Death Bed"" are: psychedelic, astmospheric, bizarre, sensuous, comfortable, surreal, dreamlike, artistic....and obscure.  This is the type of movie I search out.  I can't believe there isn't more buzz about this film as I've shared it with a few friends and they've responded with similar enthusiasm.  This is just a hidden gem.  It is not insanely scary, but it has a elegant weirdness to it that I think many people will find satisfying.The story line has already been explained: hidden little cottage out in nowhere, with a big, beautiful bed in it which invites intruders to either nap on or get naked in.  The bed then consumes them.  At first I thought the ""eating"" scenes were cheesey, but then the movie showed some scenes inside the bed as it ""digested"" its prey, and these scenes are very well done and surreal.The major artisitic fluorish of the movie is that it is narrated by the Victorian artist Aubrey Beardsley who is held captive inside the wall behind one of his paintings next to the bed. He reveals to you the history of the house, the bed, and many of the historic victims over the past century.  The elegance with which this is presented can not be overstated, especially for a film which did not have a big budget. The bed gives Beardsley gifts of the deceased's jewelry, but Beardsley still yearns to be free.  The actor who speaks Beardsley's voice was BRILLIANT, his pacing, accent, inflections are hypnotic and perfect.There is another strange series of scenes displaying a woman inside an underground coffin  on the estate of the cottage and nearby mansion.  I can't recall her exact role, but the scenes of her emerging back to consciousness are very effective and scary.I hesitate to criticize this movie at all because it was so satisfying.  I think it is an American film, and I perhaps wish it had a little more erotic emphasis such as you would see with a European film of the same era.  I believe sexuality is an important component in horror, contrasting life with death as it does.  I also did not fully understand the ending of the movie, it ended a little unexpectedly and possibly a little anti-climacticly.  But, given the overall excellence of the movie itself that was only a marginal detraction.The director, whose name I now forget, gives a little introduction about the making of the film and his failure way back when to get the movie successfully marketed.  He tells about how he actually heard about his film in underground internet chatrooms 25+ years later where bootlegged copies were being exchanged or discussed. He had all but forgotten about his little movie.  This man's modesty, his sense of humour, and his total lack of affectation had me wanting to buy him a very good bottle of cognac.  He may not take his little movie too seriously, but I see it as a serious artistic accomplishment (I'll call it ""poetic horror"") and it is in the top five of my voluminous horror collection along with Suspiria, The Haunting (the 1964 original), The Legend of Hell House, and Burnt Offerings.",5,Jack Pot!,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,3593,"['never', 'bought', 'single', 'VHS', 'tape', 'years', 'advent', 'DVD', 'find', 'spending', 'unreasonable', 'sums', 'money', 'DVD', 'things', 'beg', 'be', 'collected', 'horror', 'genre', 'where', 'seem', 'be', 'spending', 'most', 'efforts', 'cash', 'Most', 'time', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'where', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'seen', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'third', 'time', ""'m"", 'buying', 'based', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'given', 'Amazon', 'particularly', 'where', 'key', 'words', 'phrases', 'concepts', 'are', 'mentioned', 'reviewer', 'find', 'appealing.The', 'key', 'words', 'phrases', 'concepts', 'Death', 'Bed', 'are', 'psychedelic', 'astmospheric', 'bizarre', 'sensuous', 'comfortable', 'surreal', 'dreamlike', 'artistic', '.and', 'obscure', 'type', 'movie', 'search', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""n't"", 'more', 'buzz', 'film', ""'ve"", 'shared', 'few', 'friends', ""'ve"", 'responded', 'similar', 'enthusiasm', 'just', 'hidden', 'gem', 'not', 'insanely', 'scary', 'elegant', 'weirdness', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'satisfying.The', 'story', 'line', 'already', 'been', 'explained', 'hidden', 'little', 'cottage', 'out', 'nowhere', 'big', 'beautiful', 'bed', 'intruders', 'nap', 'get', 'naked', 'bed', 'then', 'first', 'thought', 'eating', 'scenes', 'were', 'cheesey', 'then', 'movie', 'showed', 'scenes', 'bed', 'digested', 'prey', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'surreal.The', 'major', 'artisitic', 'fluorish', 'movie', 'narrated', 'Victorian', 'artist', 'Aubrey', 'Beardsley', 'who', 'held', 'captive', 'wall', 'one', 'paintings', 'bed', 'history', 'house', 'bed', 'many', 'historic', 'victims', 'past', 'century', 'elegance', 'presented', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overstated', 'especially', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'big', 'budget', 'bed', 'Beardsley', 'gifts', 'deceased', 'jewelry', 'Beardsley', 'still', 'be', 'free', 'actor', 'who', 'Beardsley', 'voice', 'was', 'BRILLIANT', 'pacing', 'accent', 'inflections', 'are', 'hypnotic', 'perfect.There', 'strange', 'series', 'scenes', 'displaying', 'woman', 'underground', 'coffin', 'estate', 'cottage', 'nearby', 'mansion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'exact', 'role', 'scenes', 'emerging', 'back', 'consciousness', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'scary.I', 'hesitate', 'criticize', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'satisfying', 'think', 'American', 'film', 'perhaps', 'wish', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'erotic', 'emphasis', 'such', 'would', 'see', 'European', 'film', 'same', 'era', 'believe', 'sexuality', 'important', 'component', 'horror', 'contrasting', 'life', 'death', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'ending', 'movie', 'ended', 'little', 'unexpectedly', 'possibly', 'little', 'anti-climacticly', 'given', 'overall', 'excellence', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'marginal', 'detraction.The', 'director', 'name', 'now', 'forget', 'little', 'introduction', 'making', 'film', 'failure', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'get', 'movie', 'successfully', 'marketed', 'how', 'actually', 'heard', 'film', 'underground', 'internet', 'chatrooms', '25+', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'bootlegged', 'copies', 'were', 'being', 'exchanged', 'discussed', 'had', 'forgotten', 'little', 'movie', 'man', 'modesty', 'sense', 'humour', 'total', 'lack', 'affectation', 'had', 'wanting', 'buy', 'very', 'good', 'bottle', 'cognac', 'may', 'not', 'take', 'little', 'movie', 'too', 'seriously', 'see', 'serious', 'artistic', 'accomplishment', ""'ll"", 'call', 'poetic', 'horror', 'top', 'five', 'voluminous', 'horror', 'collection', 'Suspiria', 'Haunting', '1964', 'original', 'Legend', 'Hell', 'House', 'Burnt', 'Offerings']",N/A
