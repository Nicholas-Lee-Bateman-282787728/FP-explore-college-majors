1246158,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B0021204G0,&#308;&#308;,"[1, 1]","Kim Kardashian is known for filing a controversial divorce, starring in several reality shows, being the subject of a leaked X-rated video, and doing the Mambo (badly) on Dancing with the Stars.  Needless to say, I was a little bit skeptical on whether or not she could successfully produce a workout video that was more ""tough"" than ""fluff.""  I am amazed to tell you that while the DVD doesn't really focus on the abs as much as it would have you believe, it's one of the best total upper body workouts that I've ever done, and I've done a lot.First of all, Kim is not actually your instructor for the workout; Jennifer Galardi is the trainer that will be teaching you the exercises.  Kim is more of a student or modifier that is there to show that it's not about doing everything perfectly...it's just about doing everything to the best of your ability.  Kim will wobble and falter at times which is slightly refreshing to see after doing countless workouts where the trainer doesn't even break a sweat, much less mess up.  Jennifer will always be there, as well, to show you advanced options and maintain perfect form.  If you've ever done a Jennifer Galardi workout, then you probably will be a little surprised at the difference in this workout; while she usually is all about dancing and toning without weights, she leads a more intense workout here, almost the level of a Jillian Michaels upper body workout.The exercises included can be rough, depending on how heavy your weights are.  I was struggling with 10 pound dumbbells and had to drop down to 8 pounds, but I was still extremely sore in the morning.  This DVD is going to work nearly every upper body muscle; your back, biceps, triceps, shoulders, shoulders, chest, and core will all be bombarded with strength training.  However, my one complaint is that one of the few muscles that weren't sore in the morning was my abs.  If a DVD is going to have a muscle group in its title, then I expect to really focus on that muscle group.  It would probably be more appropriate to title this workout ""Amazing ARMS Body Sculpt.""  It is a fantastic workout for your entire upper body as a whole, but the abdominal focus just didn't seem to be there.Some of the moves that you'll see throughout the DVD will be traditional exercises such as bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, or mountain climbers.  Others will be a bit more unique and difficult to describe.  The second half of the DVD uses a step, however, you could probably modify everything so that you do all of the step exercises on the floor.  To view video clips from this DVD, search Youtube(.)com or Totalfitnessdvds(.)com for the title of this DVD.Overall, I loved this workout and recommend it to everyone looking for an upper body workout.  Whether you're a beginner to exercise or a seasoned pro, simply elevating or lowering the weight of dumbbells used will give you a different level of difficulty.  It's true that the abs aren't stressed as much as they could have been, but the final five minute ab workout is really good.  Don't let the Kim Kardashian label sway your opinion of this DVD; this is still an intense workout that you get to do with a celebrity who's just like you (exercise-wise anyway).",4,More arms than abs but still shockingly effective!,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,3224,"['Kim', 'Kardashian', 'known', 'filing', 'controversial', 'divorce', 'starring', 'several', 'reality', 'shows', 'being', 'subject', 'leaked', 'X-rated', 'video', 'doing', 'Mambo', 'badly', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'not', 'could', 'successfully', 'produce', 'workout', 'video', 'was', 'more', 'tough', 'fluff', 'am', 'amazed', 'tell', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'really', 'focus', 'abs', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'total', 'upper', 'body', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', ""'ve"", 'done', 'lot.First', 'Kim', 'not', 'actually', 'instructor', 'workout', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'trainer', 'will', 'be', 'teaching', 'exercises', 'Kim', 'more', 'student', 'modifier', 'there', 'show', 'not', 'doing', 'everything', 'perfectly', 'just', 'doing', 'everything', 'best', 'ability', 'Kim', 'will', 'wobble', 'falter', 'times', 'slightly', 'refreshing', 'see', 'doing', 'countless', 'workouts', 'where', 'trainer', ""n't"", 'even', 'break', 'sweat', 'much', 'less', 'mess', 'up', 'Jennifer', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'well', 'show', 'advanced', 'options', 'maintain', 'perfect', 'form', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'workout', 'then', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'surprised', 'difference', 'workout', 'usually', 'dancing', 'toning', 'weights', 'more', 'intense', 'workout', 'here', 'almost', 'level', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'body', 'workout.The', 'exercises', 'included', 'can', 'be', 'rough', 'depending', 'how', 'heavy', 'weights', 'are', 'was', 'struggling', '10', 'pound', 'dumbbells', 'had', 'drop', 'down', '8', 'pounds', 'was', 'still', 'extremely', 'sore', 'morning', 'DVD', 'going', 'work', 'nearly', 'upper', 'body', 'muscle', 'back', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'shoulders', 'shoulders', 'chest', 'core', 'will', 'be', 'bombarded', 'strength', 'training', 'However', 'one', 'complaint', 'one', 'few', 'muscles', 'were', ""n't"", 'sore', 'morning', 'was', 'abs', 'DVD', 'going', 'have', 'muscle', 'group', 'title', 'then', 'expect', 'really', 'focus', 'muscle', 'group', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'title', 'workout', 'Amazing', 'ARMS', 'Body', 'Sculpt', 'fantastic', 'workout', 'entire', 'upper', 'body', 'whole', 'abdominal', 'focus', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'there.Some', 'moves', ""'ll"", 'see', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'traditional', 'exercises', 'such', 'bicep', 'curls', 'tricep', 'kickbacks', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'Others', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'unique', 'difficult', 'describe', 'second', 'half', 'DVD', 'step', 'however', 'could', 'probably', 'modify', 'everything', 'do', 'step', 'floor', 'view', 'video', 'clips', 'DVD', 'search', 'Youtube', 'com', 'Totalfitnessdvds', 'com', 'title', 'DVD.Overall', 'loved', 'workout', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'looking', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'exercise', 'seasoned', 'pro', 'simply', 'elevating', 'lowering', 'weight', 'dumbbells', 'used', 'will', 'give', 'different', 'level', 'difficulty', 'true', 'abs', 'are', ""n't"", 'stressed', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'final', 'five', 'minute', 'ab', 'workout', 'really', 'good', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'Kim', 'Kardashian', 'sway', 'opinion', 'DVD', 'still', 'intense', 'workout', 'get', 'do', 'celebrity', 'who', 'just', 'exercise-wise', 'anyway']",N/A

Instead of doing mostly ab work, this workout was mainly a sculpting workout for the arms.  Not a bad thing as I love to work out my arms... just saying that if you are wanting this DVD to mainly work your abdominals you will be a little disappointed as I found the ab workout section was a little lacking compared to the segment focusing on the arms.I would not recommend this if you are a beginner to working out as it can be very tough in some parts, especially in the second workout section.I own all 3 of the DVDs in the Fit In Your Jeans By Friday series and this one is my least favorite.  I will probably only use it for the arm-toning exercises and turn it off after that point.  In the second workout there are far too many plank moves for my taste, which I found can be a bit hard on the knees.  The other thing I noticed on this DVD compared to Kim's other 2 was that the camera seemed to focus on Kim's facial expressions and rest there sometimes and that was quite annoying when trying to learn a new exercise move and not being able to see the full body.

Kim Kardashian works out with trainer Jennifer Galardi who really knows how to work your body to the limit. None of the exercises were easy although Kim seemed to be able to do everything with ease.This begins with a warm up and killer arm workout. Your arms will ache! Then there are balance challenges and fast transitions between the exercises. To keep up you really have to pay attention.I did the exercises with three-pound weights and Kim and Jennifer looked like they were using one-pound weights. So there are ways to make this workout even more challenging. I did feel that doing the stair runners with a step made them more comfortable and enjoyable.What makes some of this workout really hard is going from standing to doing pushups and back up again. Your heart will really be pumping and by the end of this workout you should be panting on the floor.To me this workout felt like a full-body workout. I could feel this in my thighs, abs, butt, back and arms. What really made this workout great was the bonus workout for abs. It is more traditional but very effective.If you are an intermediate or beginner then I can almost guarantee you are going to feel the burn. I wasn't expecting such a good workout but I'm pleasantly surprised.

1246170,AP9JZONAK4ZC6,B0021204G0,Valentine,"[4, 4]","When Kim Kardashian released her work-out series, I knew I had to buy it; first, because I'm enamored of the Kardashian family--they love fashion and work in the field (jealous), they have a Brady-Bunch family that seems very loving and they makes lots of $ and are very successful and they're all gorgeous Hollywood-ites. Plus, I'm a DVD-fitness-aholic and own and stay in shape with 100+ videos.This DVD starts with an idle warm-up-some simple stretching and begins 2 segments of arm work with short and infrequent cardio bursts--plus, some floor core work (nothing too impressive or new) and while Kim is engaging, her attitude and demeanor with the trainer is a little sour (she might not like working-out as much as say, Renee Zellweger) but her overall energy and enthusiasm is pretty palatable. I did work up a sweat and had sore arms for a few days but the DVD seemed to lack a real tight flow--there were many moments that slowed or stalled the pace. Kim's trainer often defers to Kim which is quite funny as it's like the ghostwriter of a book deferring to the ""author"" to make a comment on the book content---the trainer should take the helm and let Kim serve as eye-candy as Kim herself admits on the DVD to having a ""limited and lazy"" approach to fitness in the past.Comparing the DVD to Kim's wardrobe: it lacks the true spunk, originality and fierceness as her fun and fabulous frocks but remains eye-catching, charming and overall pretty decent for a celebrity fitness DVD routine (intermediate recommended).",4,Kim-me This DVD for a Solid Work-Out,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,1524,"['When', 'Kim', 'Kardashian', 'released', 'work-out', 'series', 'knew', 'had', 'buy', 'first', ""'m"", 'enamored', 'Kardashian', 'family', 'love', 'fashion', 'work', 'field', 'jealous', 'have', 'Brady-Bunch', 'family', 'very', 'loving', 'lots', 'are', 'very', 'successful', ""'re"", 'gorgeous', 'Hollywood-ites', ""'m"", 'DVD-fitness-aholic', 'own', 'stay', 'shape', '100+', 'videos.This', 'DVD', 'idle', 'warm-up-some', 'simple', 'stretching', '2', 'segments', 'arm', 'work', 'short', 'infrequent', 'cardio', 'bursts', 'floor', 'core', 'work', 'nothing', 'too', 'impressive', 'new', 'Kim', 'engaging', 'attitude', 'demeanor', 'trainer', 'little', 'sour', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'working-out', 'as', 'much', 'say', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'overall', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'pretty', 'palatable', 'did', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'had', 'sore', 'arms', 'few', 'days', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'lack', 'real', 'tight', 'flow', 'were', 'many', 'moments', 'slowed', 'stalled', 'pace', 'Kim', 'trainer', 'often', 'Kim', 'quite', 'funny', 'ghostwriter', 'book', 'deferring', 'author', 'make', 'comment', 'book', 'content', '-the', 'trainer', 'should', 'take', 'helm', 'let', 'Kim', 'serve', 'as', 'eye-candy', 'Kim', 'DVD', 'having', 'limited', 'lazy', 'approach', 'fitness', 'past.Comparing', 'DVD', 'Kim', 'wardrobe', 'true', 'spunk', 'originality', 'fierceness', 'fun', 'fabulous', 'frocks', 'eye-catching', 'charming', 'overall', 'pretty', 'decent', 'celebrity', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'routine', 'intermediate', 'recommended']",N/A

I still need to drop a few pounds in order to do the workout for the abs on the step due my poor core strength. Other than that, the arm workouts are awesome! For the first time, I really can see results. Especially, my triceps, that's a big problem area for me.

No novices or severely overweight sculptors allowed. Although physically active for many years, a recent illness skyrocketed me to 216 lbs! Doing this DVD at 216 lbs. was an extreme challenge, but it felt great!I would NOT recommend it if you are totally new to exercise. DOWNSIDES: The unnessarily long face shots of Kim are a bit annoying if you're here to exercise and not stare at Kim.  I only gave it 3 stars because neither the trainer or Kim lead you smoothly into the next exercise; they jump from one to the next before announcing the switch. Kim also tended to ""relax"" at times she should have been on top of her game. She's her usual self with the whining and ""baby talk.""  I'm not hating - I like Kim! I just have a low tolerance for a grown woman acting that way, especially if she's supposed to be ""training"" me.All in all, I would recommend it if you're semi-fit and do not have a lot of weight to hit the floor, jump in the air, hit the floor, jump in the air...you get the point.
