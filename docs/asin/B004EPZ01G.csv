1402126,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,B004EPZ01G,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[3, 4]","When you sit down with a PG-rated movie ""inspired by a true story"", you can pretty much bet that every move is telegraphed far in advance, there will be no surprises and that everything will come up roses. As long as you go into this movie managing your expectations about any bumps in the ride or unexpected outcomes...go ahead and watch. No matter how cliche-ridden and predictable it is (and it *is* both of those, from start to finish), if you aren't reaching for your tissues at the end, then have who ever you've watched it with check you for a heartbeat...because you might not have one.In a nutshell: awkward, loner pre-teen Sawyer is saying goodbye to his cousin Kyle as the movie opens. Saywer has been sentenced to summer school and Kyle is shipping off for an overseas combat tour (we never learn where), finishing up his Army time so he can resume training for unspecified future competitive swimming goals.Then, in order:-Sawyer is second on the scene at a Florida beach where an injured dolphin (who will eventually be named ""Winter"") has beached.-Sawyer uses the Swiss Army knife Kyle gave him to help free the dolphin, who is rescued by a local marine animal hospital and rescue facility.-We quickly learn the hospital is in dire financial straits, and sits in the sights of an apparently evil hotel developer.-Winter the Dolphin loses her tail to infection. Even though she improvises with a side-to-side swimming technique, we learn that this will damage her spinal cord (which is designed for an up-down motion) and eventually kill her.You know what happens next.Please note that even with these details, there's not a spoiler in sight in any of what follows; trust me when I tell you there are NO surprises in this movie):-Kyle returns home wounded and bitter (but with all his limbs still attached).-Sawyer bonds with the dolphin as he comes out of his awkward shell and falls into the orbit of the hospital's main players, including Hazel, a pre-teen girl his age.-After Sawyer is reported truant, his mom (Ashley Judd) dismisses him from the tyranny of summer school to help tend to the dolphin.-Veterans Affairs prosthetic specialist (Morgan Freeman) is roped into the dolphin's rehab efforts by Sawyer after a visit to Kyle at the VA hospital.-Bitter, distant and injured GI Kyle becomes happy and healed after the connection between his wounds and the dolphin's is revealed.-Oh yeah: Winter ends up loving the prosthetic tail after rejecting many protoypes.-The developer decides not to build, but to instead fund the rescue organization's continued operation after seeing the grassroots support Sawyer grew as fundraising effort for the dolphin and the hospital.-And yes, his summer school teacher sees all of this in action at a gala fundraiser, and offers Sawyer experiential learning credit..Each of these messages is pounded with the subtlety of a sledgehammer...but hang in there anyway.Just before the credits roll, we're treated to real-world video of Winter and a montage of her recovery, and then the exposure of many differently-abled children and adults (including veterans of Southwest Asia combat). Get out your tissues then, becasue you'll be needing them. Other than the possibility of romance between Hazel's dad (widowed Harry Connick, Jr.) and Sawyer's mom (divorced Ashley Judd), or  an awkward first kiss between Hazel and Sawyer, there is NO cliche left unturned in this movie.I don't know how the real-world events differed from the ""inspired by"" events in the movie, but I'm guessing they did not get wrapped up in such a tidy little package.Even with all that: set aside your cynicism for a few minutes and you'll be left with an enjoyable enough (and very family-friendly) movie that dishes out formulaic sweetness with no surprises.",4,Good family movie; you get exactly what you expect in every frame...,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3786,"['When', 'sit', 'down', 'PG-rated', 'movie', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'bet', 'move', 'telegraphed', 'far', 'advance', 'will', 'be', 'surprises', 'everything', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'roses', 'As', 'long', 'go', 'movie', 'managing', 'expectations', 'bumps', 'ride', 'unexpected', 'outcomes', 'go', 'ahead', 'watch', 'matter', 'how', 'cliche-ridden', 'predictable', '*is*', 'start', 'finish', 'are', ""n't"", 'reaching', 'tissues', 'end', 'then', 'have', 'who', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'check', 'heartbeat', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'one.In', 'nutshell', 'awkward', 'loner', 'pre-teen', 'Sawyer', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'cousin', 'Kyle', 'movie', 'Saywer', 'been', 'sentenced', 'summer', 'school', 'Kyle', 'shipping', 'off', 'overseas', 'combat', 'tour', 'never', 'learn', 'where', 'finishing', 'up', 'Army', 'time', 'can', 'resume', 'training', 'unspecified', 'future', 'competitive', 'swimming', 'goals.Then', 'order', '-Sawyer', 'second', 'scene', 'Florida', 'beach', 'where', 'injured', 'dolphin', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'named', 'Winter', 'beached.-Sawyer', 'Swiss', 'Army', 'knife', 'Kyle', 'gave', 'help', 'free', 'dolphin', 'who', 'rescued', 'local', 'marine', 'animal', 'hospital', 'rescue', 'facility.-We', 'quickly', 'learn', 'hospital', 'dire', 'financial', 'straits', 'sits', 'sights', 'apparently', 'evil', 'hotel', 'developer.-Winter', 'Dolphin', 'tail', 'infection', 'Even', 'side-to-side', 'swimming', 'technique', 'learn', 'will', 'damage', 'spinal', 'cord', 'designed', 'up-down', 'motion', 'eventually', 'kill', 'her.You', 'know', 'what', 'next.Please', 'note', 'even', 'details', 'not', 'spoiler', 'sight', 'what', 'trust', 'when', 'tell', 'are', 'surprises', 'movie', '-Kyle', 'returns', 'home', 'wounded', 'bitter', 'limbs', 'still', 'attached', '.-Sawyer', 'bonds', 'dolphin', 'awkward', 'shell', 'orbit', 'hospital', 'main', 'players', 'including', 'Hazel', 'pre-teen', 'girl', 'age.-After', 'Sawyer', 'reported', 'truant', 'mom', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'tyranny', 'summer', 'school', 'help', 'tend', 'dolphin.-Veterans', 'Affairs', 'prosthetic', 'specialist', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'roped', 'dolphin', 'rehab', 'efforts', 'Sawyer', 'visit', 'Kyle', 'VA', 'hospital.-Bitter', 'distant', 'injured', 'GI', 'Kyle', 'happy', 'healed', 'connection', 'wounds', 'dolphin', 'revealed.-Oh', 'yeah', 'Winter', 'up', 'loving', 'prosthetic', 'tail', 'rejecting', 'many', 'protoypes.-The', 'developer', 'not', 'build', 'instead', 'fund', 'rescue', 'organization', 'continued', 'operation', 'seeing', 'grassroots', 'support', 'Sawyer', 'grew', 'fundraising', 'effort', 'dolphin', 'hospital.-And', 'yes', 'summer', 'school', 'teacher', 'action', 'gala', 'fundraiser', 'Sawyer', 'experiential', 'learning', 'credit..Each', 'messages', 'pounded', 'subtlety', 'sledgehammer', 'hang', 'anyway.Just', 'credits', 'roll', ""'re"", 'treated', 'real-world', 'video', 'Winter', 'montage', 'recovery', 'then', 'exposure', 'many', 'differently-abled', 'children', 'adults', 'including', 'veterans', 'Southwest', 'Asia', 'combat', 'Get', 'tissues', 'then', 'becasue', ""'ll"", 'be', 'needing', 'Other', 'possibility', 'romance', 'Hazel', 'dad', 'widowed', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Sawyer', 'mom', 'divorced', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'awkward', 'first', 'kiss', 'Hazel', 'Sawyer', 'cliche', 'left', 'unturned', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'real-world', 'events', 'differed', 'inspired', 'events', 'movie', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'such', 'tidy', 'little', 'package.Even', 'set', 'aside', 'cynicism', 'few', 'minutes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'left', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'very', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'out', 'formulaic', 'sweetness', 'surprises']",Dolphin Tale
1402127,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004EPZ01G,A kids review,"[2, 2]","Inspirational stories aimed at a younger demographic and featuring exceptional animals are far from original, but every once in a while, one will come along that somehow manages to capture a genuine winning spirit. Dolphin Tale, based on true events, is one such movie. The film centers on Winter, a rescued dolphin whose tail is deformed by a crab trap, and the humans -- including Morgan Freeman as a prosthetics specialist -- whose pioneering efforts and moral support help her to overcome her physical challenges. I found Dolphin Tale to be an earnest, sweet, and well-told story enjoyable enough for kids and parents alike, thanks in part to the decision to dial down the schmaltz. Probably a safe bet if you're looking for something uplifting for the kids that won't bore you to tears in the process.",4,Dolphin Tale,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,806,"['Inspirational', 'stories', 'aimed', 'younger', 'demographic', 'featuring', 'exceptional', 'animals', 'are', 'far', 'original', 'once', 'while', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'somehow', 'capture', 'genuine', 'winning', 'spirit', 'Dolphin', 'Tale', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'one', 'such', 'movie', 'film', 'centers', 'Winter', 'rescued', 'dolphin', 'tail', 'deformed', 'crab', 'trap', 'humans', 'including', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'prosthetics', 'specialist', 'pioneering', 'efforts', 'moral', 'support', 'help', 'overcome', 'physical', 'challenges', 'found', 'Dolphin', 'Tale', 'be', 'earnest', 'sweet', 'well-told', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'kids', 'parents', 'alike', 'thanks', 'part', 'decision', 'dial', 'down', 'schmaltz', 'Probably', 'safe', 'bet', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'uplifting', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'tears', 'process']",Dolphin Tale

Take every cheesy after-school special you have EVER seen and roll it into one terrible movie.Watching this movie shouldn't have been painful, but it was. The older actors were awful, which shouldn't have been the case. Ashley Judd and Harry Connick Jr are great actors! And the younger cast was so stilted and akward that I felt bad for them, not as bad as I felt for myself, but bad nonetheless. Did the producers think that just because they had a great story line they could get away with making a head-ache inducing movie?My seven year old begged to see this movie, so we rented it, for which I'm thankful, as it only cost me a dollar. Within twenty minutes I was so sick to my stomach from the bad acting, horrible dialogue and forced feel-good-ness that I was tempted to turn it off and tell my daughter the movie was scratched. It was too much, too forced, and very boring. Which is sad, because the story line should have made for a wonderful family movie. Unfortunately, this movie is TOO feel good.

As a result of the missing tail, Dr. McCarthy, played by Morgan Freeman, is asked to design a prosthetic tail for the dolphin.  Although it is rated PG, the story is really appropriate for all ages and especially dolphin lovers.Some of the choices made by the director, Charles Martin Smith, was a little disappointing.  One of the setbacks is a storm which causes major loss in money and forces the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, the aquarium that rescued Winter the dolphin, to close down.  Therefore the aquarium was forced to find homes for all the animals, except they couldn't find one for Winter, due to the lack of chance of survival.  The title and previews also made the movie very predictable, but it was still very moving and inspirational.As the main character (besides for Winter of course), Nathan Gamble as Sawyer Nelson starts off as a young kid not doing well in school, and spending most of his summer in summer school and his tool shack where he builds many things including helicopters.  At the start of the movie, Sawyer is a shy and timid boy, but as the movie goes on you see his love for Winter and how he starts to really enjoy life.",5,Dolphin Tale Review,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,1304,"['Dolphin', 'Tale', 'touching', 'story', 'dolphin', 'struggling', 'survive', 'loss', 'tail', 'modern', '2011', 'film', 'place', 'Florida', 'result', 'missing', 'tail', 'Dr.', 'McCarthy', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'asked', 'design', 'prosthetic', 'tail', 'dolphin', 'rated', 'PG', 'story', 'really', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'especially', 'dolphin', 'lovers.Some', 'choices', 'made', 'director', 'Charles', 'Martin', 'Smith', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'One', 'setbacks', 'storm', 'major', 'loss', 'money', 'Clearwater', 'Marine', 'Aquarium', 'aquarium', 'rescued', 'Winter', 'dolphin', 'close', 'down', 'aquarium', 'was', 'forced', 'find', 'homes', 'animals', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', 'Winter', 'due', 'lack', 'chance', 'survival', 'title', 'previews', 'also', 'made', 'movie', 'very', 'predictable', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'moving', 'inspirational.As', 'main', 'character', 'Winter', 'course', 'Nathan', 'Gamble', 'Sawyer', 'Nelson', 'off', 'young', 'kid', 'not', 'doing', 'well', 'school', 'spending', 'most', 'summer', 'summer', 'school', 'tool', 'shack', 'where', 'many', 'things', 'including', 'helicopters', 'start', 'movie', 'Sawyer', 'shy', 'timid', 'boy', 'movie', 'see', 'love', 'Winter', 'how', 'really', 'enjoy', 'life']",Dolphin Tale

1402149,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B004EPZ01G,California Dreaming,"[2, 2]","What makes humans love dolphins so much?  Is it the fact that dolphins are very social, just like us?  (I might argue that being ""social"" isn't always such a good thing, but that would be an argument for another day.)  Or could it be that a common ancestor of both humans and dolphins lost their tails eons ago, left the water, and decided to walk on land?  And we feel a real connection to dolphins today because of it?You'd have to have a heart of stone to not like ""Dolphin Tale,"" an obviously very inspirational movie for the entire family about getting through adversity.  I've seen this film a couple of times now, and I liked it the second time almost as much as the first.  Winter -- the dolphin who loses her tail in a tragic accident -- is one of the most sympathetic characters you'll ever meet, animal or human, and there is a connection between her and the audience that is unmistakable.I just reviewed ""The Magic of Belle Isle,"" a film that was, well, not very magical.  In that film, Morgan Freeman gave a very mediocre performance, something that surely doesn't happen very often.  Not here.  He's excellent, and he's almost as sympathetic as Winter.  He's building an artificial tail for Winter, on-his-own-time-and-on-his-own-dime, but you probably already knew that part.  Nathan Gamble, the boy who finds Winter on the beach and helps save her, is also very good here, as is Harry Connick Jr.But the star who makes a real splash is most definitely Cozi Zuehlsdorff.  She's a little firecracker, and she gives an amazing performance for her age.  The one character that didn't quite work for me though:  Kris Kristofferson.  It's not his acting here per se that's off, but rather it's the dialog written for him.  He comes off sounding like a human bumper sticker, kind of like the wheelchair-bound teacher in ""Dodgeball.""  (The character in Dodgeball was really funny, because it was supposed to be funny.  I was laughing at Mr. Kristofferson's lines here when it wasn't supposed to be funny.)Winter loses her tail, and that's certainly not a spoiler.  What might be:  maybe humans like her more because of it, because she's then more like them, maybe more like that possible common ancestor.  But why doesn't much matter.

Ashley Judd plays Lorraine Nelson, Sawyer's mom, in a good performance, despite her limited part.  Morgan Freeman is charming and delightful in his part as Dr. Cameron McCarthy, a prosthesis specialist. You might also spot the prolific character actor Richard Libertini as a fisherman in the beginning of the movie. (It's a shame they only give him a bit part, he deserves more.)  But, the dolphin is the heart of the story.  Unfortunately, due to extensive damage, its tail has to be amputated.

1402166,A19939E8YK1FGC,B004EPZ01G,Donna Do-right,"[3, 7]","Given the reviews by prominent newspapers and magazines, I looked forward to viewing ""Dolphin Tale"" with a lot of enthusiasm, and even bought the DVD without viewing it first (I don't know why I don't learn from past experiences....).  It had a great cast, and had Winter, the actual dolphin, telling this tale of survival and hope.  However, I was sickened by the ""disney-ism"" of the story--the overly-sweet and incredibly unrealistic portrayals of all the characters involved.  Morgan Freeman's character was stupified into a bumbling ""scientist"" making inept attempts to help Winter; the actual scientist was much more knowledgeable about what he was dealing with, and it was a mis-use of a brilliant actor.  The children in this make-believe story were nice actors, but the writers missed the boat on them, giving them almost adult attitudes that were unbelievable for the ages of children.  The animal actors were given behaviors that were cartoonish and not factual whatsoever, but typical of a Disney movie.  I expected to see the actual story of Winter's rescue and follow the attempts to fit her with a prosthesis--what I got was a story that was ""inspired by"" her story.  That means yes, Winter was rescued and had a new tail made for her, but the rest was a cartoon--this movie would have been better made as an animated feature, which would have allowed for the mis-represented and unbelievable, human-like behaviors forced onto the animals.I expect that the same tripe will be served up to audiences for the upcoming ""Big Miracle"", the story of the three young gray whales trapped by Artic ice, and 2 were rescued by volunteers cutting holes into the ice in a trail leading them to open water.  I read the book by Tom Rose (""Big Miracle"") of the actual rescue, and there weren't any children mentioned, and the woman portrayed by Drew Barrymore was just one of the many people involved with the rescue.  So we will be fed a another fairy tale story of behavoirs not seen in wild animals, even from such intelligent creatures such as whales, and a riduculous fairy tale about the people involved.  It makes me sick, knowing that some people will believe this fictitious story (and that of ""Dolphin Tale"") as actual fact, instead of viewing it as a fairy tale.  So beware whenever you see the words ""inspired by the story of..."", don't believe a word they say.  And certainly never, ever purchase a DVD with that disclaimer without viewing it first!!!

It is refreshing to see a film that is not about dumbed down man-boys or out of control female men hunters or vampires or cartoon characters. The story, based on a true incident is touching and life reaffirming and deserves a place on the plates of all people who care about their fellow beings. If at times the film becomes a bit heavy on the saccharine level then that too is forgivable. The message is sweet and the tale is well told by a group of actors who are obviously more committed to this story than just a movie script.Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) is a lonely and friendless boy who finds and untangles a hurt dolphin that is caught in a crab trap. He becomes very attached to the dolphin when the tail must be taken off to save the dolphin's life. The boy believes the dolphin would be able to swim normally if it was given a prosthetic tail. He rarely leaves the dolphin (now called Winter) while at the financially struggling aquarium run by Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.). Sawyer bonds with Haskett's daughter ((Cozi Zuehlsdorff) and together they maneuver the invention of an appliance that will allow Winter to swim. Sawyer meets Dr. McCarthy (Morgan Freeman), who works with the veterans who need prosthetic limbs. Sawyer then draws Dr. McCarthy into the project of designing and building a prosthetic tail for Winter. The ending is gratefully predictable.The large cast includes Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson, Austin Stowell, Frances Sternhagen and a flock of others in addition to the ones mentioned above. This is a committed group who make the best of a rather predictable plot and simplistic dialogue.  Lots of Hallmark sensibilities, but then that is what the story is about - emotions and caring and healing.  At 110 minutes it could have been edited and carried more impact, but it is a nice diversion, one that most every viewer can enjoy.

1402192,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B004EPZ01G,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[1, 1]","""Dolphin Tale"", based on actual events, is an inspiring story about overcoming obstacles and learning how to survive.Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) is a young boy who is having trouble at school.  Forced to attend summer school, Sawyer usually amuses himself by tinkering with remote control helicopters in his garage.  His only friend seems to be his older cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell).  Soon, Kyle is called to active duty in the Army, leaving Sawyer alone, or so it seems, but everything in Sawyer's life is about to change.One day while riding his bike, Sawyer discovers an injured dolphin on the beach.  Soon, an immediate connection between Sawyer and the dolphin is formed.  A rescue team led by marine biologist Clay (Harry Connick Jr.) and his young daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) has taken the injured dolphin into care.  Soon, Sawyer is spending all of his time with Hazel, Clay, and the dolphin, now named Winter.  Winter's injuries required her tail to be amputated, and she is having difficulty adjusting.  Clay soon discovers that Winter's compensation for her missing tail is causing damage that, if left untreated, could kill her.  Meanwhile, Kyle has been discharged from the Army after suffering injuries in an explosion.  He has lost ability to use his legs and is in a wheelchair.  He has been working with a prosthetist (Morgan Freeman) to regain use of his legs.  This has given Sawyer an idea; if Kyle can be helped with prosthetics, then maybe Winter can, too.  So begins a journey of constructing a tail so Winter can return to her normal swimming ways.  Packed with incredible highs and deep lows, Sawyer, Clay, Hazel, and Winter begin an incredible journey that will make you cheer.This is an excellent movie.  I'm a fan of true-life stories, and ""Dolphin Tale"" is full of inspiration, triumph, and overcoming obstacles.  The acting is first-rate, and the story is heartwarming.

1402195,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,B004EPZ01G,Jeremy Storly,"[0, 0]","Innocuous and warmhearted, this film is good, clean fun.  It also seems to be remarkably faithful to the real-life story that inspired it.  The scenes with the dolphin Winter are incredible and convincing, and although the film is often sentimental to the point of being sappy and predictable, it retains a sincerety that makes this film quite touching.  Knowing that this was based on a true story certainly helps.  I am not ashamed to admit that there were a few scenes during which I had a hard time holding back tears.One thing that mildly annoyed me was this movie's treatment of the boy's summer school teacher.  First of all, the teacher's lessons seem to be outdated, and do not reflect any trend in education within the past twenty years.  Secondly, the teacher seems to be expected to accept an essay in lieu of classroom instruction.  In this time of high-stakes testing and common core standards, how realistic is this?  That the boy would be excused from summer school to pursue something that is meaningful to him is understandable, but to pressure a teacher to grant credit for work that may not meet rigorous state or national standards is unfair.  I may be spending an undue amount of time dwelling on this point, but it is a theme that preyed on my mind.Issues of unfairness aside, the plot is touching, the performance of the dolphin convincing, and it is a good, clean ""family night"" movie that could be enjoyed by almost any audience.  It respects its source material, and it asserts an important theme: the emotional connection between human and animal.

Young Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble), 11 years old, is struggling with school and life in general.  His father left him and his mother 5 years earlier and his best friend Kyle Connellan (Austin Stowell) is his much older cousin that is leaving to join the army.  Sawyer just feels like everyone he loves leaves him behind. On the way to school he helps rescue a dolphin that is beached and severely injured by being trapped in a crab cage and rope.The Clearwater Marine Hospital comes to rescue the dolphin and she is named Winter by the staff.  Sawyer visits Winter because they have bonded and they both respond to each other's presence. There Sawyer meets Hazel (Cozi Zuehisdorff) who is the head doctor's daughter and he befriends her.  Winter's condition continues to worsen until Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) has to amputate her tail to save her life.  Winter learns to swim without a tail but the strange motions she uses builds up muscle that again jeopardizes her life.Meanwhile Kyle is injured while at war and loses the use of his legs.What transpires is a story of love, courage, persistence and family that shows how with those things you can overcome hardships.  The star studded cast does a wonderful job in the movie and the young cast members carry the movie by playing great roles.

This movie will draw you in.  The movie has well known actors as well as young newer ones as well.  This was such a good movie.The movie is about a young boy who is kind of in a rut.  He never does good at school, has few if any friends and does not have a father.  One day while he is out, he hears a man.  The man is asking him if he has a phone.  There is a dolphin that has washed up on shore and is tangled in something.  While the man is away for a short time, the boy goes and sits right next to the dolphin.  So the movie begins.  I do not want to give to much away, but the dolphin is more hurt than the people at the marine place know.  First, they just think he is hurt and needs to be healed back to health.  Then they realize that his tail is more hurt than they realize.  They have to remove it.  You will see the journey the boy, his family, the marine doctor and the dolphin through out the movie.  At the beginning, the boy stays by himself.  His cousin who is joining the Army tries to get him to interact and be happy.  The man goes to war and when he comes back, the role switches.  Him and his younger cousin are in each others shoes.  It is all very interesting and heart warming.  I get this weird feeling a few times and started to tear up.

1402208,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B004EPZ01G,Kathy W,"[15, 20]","This is one of the most emotionally powerful movies I have seen in a very long time!  5 stars does not even begin to cover it!  Based on a true story, young dolphin ""Winter"" faces impossible odds to live without a tail.  My only hope is that I can provide a review that is worthy of this beautiful story.  I saw this in the 2-D version and it was outstanding!The movie opens with a few minutes of beautiful underwater shots and dolphins swimming in what appears to be their natural habitat.  Then we see commercial crabbers dropping their traps and ropes. ""Winter"" plays herself in this powerful heart-centered movie about love, caring, and perseverance.We flip over to learn a bit about young Sawyer (Nathan Gamble), a very quiet, keep-to-himself young man about age 12.  Champion swimmer cousin Kyle tries to bring young Sawyer out of his self-imposed closet, but it just ain't happening. Then Kyle joins the army because they will pay his way through college and Sawyer is soon to be without his big-brother type cousin.While riding along South Beach, Sawyer approaches a beached dolphin, tangled in ropes and dragging a metal crab trap.  Her tail and mouth are bloody and the ropes are tightened around her tail.  Dolphin and boy bond immediately as he begins to cut the ropes that bind her, while making short whistling noises to answer her dolphin sounds.  Dr. Clay (Harry Connick Jr) and young daughter Hazel are among the Clearwater Marine Hospital folks who arrive quickly and take the little 3-month old dolphin in and try to save her tail.Dolphin rehab begins to take effect when Sawyer sneaks into the Marine Hospital to see how his new friend is doing.  Then, Kyle is injured during his active duty tour and he reminds us what some of our men and women in the service go through when they return home and must adjust to permanent changes in their lives.  We begin to watch lives intertwine and healing begin in many ways as folks are touched by something special and wonderful.Ashley Judd plays Sawyer's mom (Lorraine) and Morgan Freeman plays Dr Cameron  who helps soldiers with prosthetic devices at the Veteran's Hospital. Kris Kristofferson plays Harry Connick's dad.  Rufus (named so because he lives on the roof) the pestering pelican provides comic relief throughout the movie.Through the tears, fears, and worries, I found some laugh-out-loud moments throughout the movie, laughing so loud I thought someone was going to tell me to shut up!.  There is also play time between the boy and the dolphin.The real Winter was rescued from Mosquito Lagoon (near Cape Canaveral) and now lives at the Clearwater Aquarium, in Florida.  She lost her entire tail and two vertebrae and wears a prosthetic device, as many humans do.  She is an amazing lesson to us all about determination, adjusting to life's changes, and perseverance -- about taking the lemons and making lemonade.  Her lesson is also about how amputees and disabled children can be encouraged by an itty bitty dolphin who has overcome all the odds.  The gel sleeve developed for prosthetics in this story is said to be in use today.This charming movie touched me at the soul level.  I urge you to take your children, and yourself, to see it - then buy the movie to watch over and over again. It has powerful lessons in it!  Keep your tissues close by.)Oh, and hang out for some extra tape right after the end of the movie.  Looks like it is probably photos of the real rescue and folks in the actual story.

The dolphin is nursed back to health at a marine animal rescue hospital, but an infection results in the loss of her tail.  Without a tail, she swims awkwardly and could permanently damage her spine.  Can she be saved in time?Well, of course she can, as this family-friendly PG movie is based on a true story.  (The part of the tailless dolphin is played by the real-life, ""Winter."")  This is a wholesome movie with many stars, but I think the writer went overboard creating unnecessary characters, cutesy situations, and conflict.**SPOILER**The movie focuses on Sawyer, who has trouble with his teacher; Sawyer's beloved cousin, injured in an unnamed war, has a rehab doctor who fashions the dolphin's new prosthetic tail; the animal hospital is in danger of being being bought out by a land developer.  The problem is, none of that really happened and it all seems very contrived, predictable, and often dull.  (I fell asleep in the middle.)

Based on a true story of a real dolphin named Winter, and a young boy named Kyle who rescues a dolphin with its tail caught in a lobster trap. It follows somewhat in the tradition of Flipper, andFree Willy (Keepcase).  It's fair to say, if you enjoyed those you will love this.As the movie begins Kyle is a withdrawn 12 year old. As we get further into the movie we understand why.At a going away party for his cousin, a soldier and former swimming champion, Kyle would rather be alone in the garage indulging a hobby than out swimming. His cousin encourages him to be more social.  At school he struggles.When he rescues the dolphin he meets a young girl named Hazel. Ultimately, the encounter awakens in him a curiosity, and a purpose, and the dolphin and he form a special bond. He helps to heal the dolphin, and the dolphin helps to heal him, and you can see how he becomes more confident, outgoing and social. In his quest to help Winter, he encounters a prosthetic maker played by Morgan Freeman, and when the dolphin loses his tale finds ways to fashion a new prosthetic one. I must admit that I thought at times I was watching a special effects dolphin, but it turns out that it was the real dolphin, which added even more to the experience.Along the way there are many adventures, and twists and turns, which bring heartwarming moments, and gripping and inspiring moments. When his cousin returns from war, he too is withdrawn. Kyle encourages him to be more social. Ultimately, anyone who comes in contact with Winter becomes inspired, and that includes the viewer, and a territorial pelican provides many moments of comic relief.I consider this one of the best movies of the year, and one that is sure to be enjoyed by the whole family, not just for the children.I particularly liked how whatever happened, the children were able to be proactive, and solve whatever problem came up. This included fundraising to save the dolphin, and quite creative and resourceful solutions. Undoubtedly, this will inspire many children to be the same way, and think and act for themselves. The real dolphin encouraged real people to overcome their perceived limitations.The movie has a great cast of established stars including Ashley Judd, who was inpsired by the script, and really wanted to be part of it, Harry Connick Jr, and Kris Kristofferson. The movie belongs to the kids, with great central performances by Nathan Gamble as Kyle and Cozy Z as Hazel.So, ultimately whether it's a real tail, a prosthetic tail, or no tail, if you're like me, Winter's Tale will inspire you.I think you will love it, and I hope this review was helpful.",5,A summer tale of winter's tail,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,2684,"['whale', 'tale', 'not', 'tale', 'whale', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'real', 'dolphin', 'named', 'Winter', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Kyle', 'who', 'dolphin', 'tail', 'caught', 'lobster', 'trap', 'somewhat', 'tradition', 'Flipper', 'andFree', 'Willy', 'Keepcase', 'fair', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'love', 'this.As', 'movie', 'Kyle', 'withdrawn', '12', 'year', 'old', 'get', 'further', 'movie', 'understand', 'why.At', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'cousin', 'soldier', 'former', 'swimming', 'champion', 'Kyle', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'alone', 'garage', 'indulging', 'hobby', 'out', 'swimming', 'cousin', 'be', 'more', 'social', 'school', 'dolphin', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Hazel', 'Ultimately', 'encounter', 'awakens', 'curiosity', 'purpose', 'dolphin', 'form', 'special', 'bond', 'heal', 'dolphin', 'dolphin', 'heal', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'more', 'confident', 'outgoing', 'social', 'quest', 'help', 'Winter', 'prosthetic', 'maker', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'when', 'dolphin', 'tale', 'finds', 'ways', 'fashion', 'new', 'prosthetic', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'thought', 'times', 'was', 'watching', 'special', 'effects', 'dolphin', 'out', 'was', 'real', 'dolphin', 'added', 'even', 'more', 'experience.Along', 'way', 'are', 'many', 'adventures', 'twists', 'turns', 'bring', 'heartwarming', 'moments', 'gripping', 'inspiring', 'moments', 'When', 'cousin', 'returns', 'war', 'too', 'withdrawn', 'Kyle', 'be', 'more', 'social', 'Ultimately', 'anyone', 'who', 'contact', 'Winter', 'becomes', 'inspired', 'viewer', 'territorial', 'pelican', 'many', 'moments', 'comic', 'relief.I', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'one', 'sure', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'family', 'not', 'just', 'children.I', 'particularly', 'liked', 'how', 'happened', 'children', 'were', 'able', 'be', 'proactive', 'solve', 'problem', 'came', 'up', 'included', 'fundraising', 'save', 'dolphin', 'quite', 'creative', 'resourceful', 'solutions', 'Undoubtedly', 'will', 'inspire', 'many', 'children', 'be', 'same', 'way', 'think', 'act', 'real', 'dolphin', 'encouraged', 'real', 'people', 'overcome', 'perceived', 'limitations.The', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'established', 'stars', 'including', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'who', 'was', 'inpsired', 'script', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'part', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'movie', 'kids', 'great', 'central', 'performances', 'Nathan', 'Gamble', 'Kyle', 'Cozy', 'Z', 'Hazel.So', 'ultimately', 'real', 'tail', 'prosthetic', 'tail', 'tail', ""'re"", 'Winter', 'Tale', 'will', 'inspire', 'you.I', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'hope', 'review', 'was', 'helpful']",Dolphin Tale

If so, ""Dolphin Tale"" is for you.In this ""inspired by a true story"" film, a baby dolphin is injured when she is entangled in crab pot lines. She washes up on a beach in Florida where Sawyer, the lonely son of a single mother, sees her. The Clearwater Marine Hospital picks her up. Hazel, the daughter of the hospital chief of staff, names the dolphin ""Winter.""  Winter recovers but her tail must be amputated. She learns to swim by wiggling side-to-side, but if she continues to do that indefinitely, it will damage her spine and kill her. The movie concerns efforts to design a prosthetic tail that Winter will wear by Sawyer, Hazel, the marine hospital staff and a prosthetic specialist doctor Sawyer meets at the VA hospital when visiting his war-wounded cousin. The Marine Hospital is also struggling financially and trying to raise enough money so it can avoid being bought by a wealthy developer who intends to tear it down and build a resort. The lonely Sawyer finds a friend in Hazel and something to be passionate about in the effort to save Winter.Here's what ""Dolphin Tale"" is missing:1.  Dazzling special effects2.  Bodily function jokes3.  Swearing4.  Anything remotely sexually suggestive (I expected the filmmakers to turn up the heat between Hazel's widowed father and Sawyer's abandoned mother, but they don't)5.  Magic6.  Super powers7.  Car, spacecraft or other vehicle chases8.  Battles9.  Explosions10.  Violence11. Diva actingHere's what ""Dolphin Tale"" has:1.  A story that engages even kids who usually demand slam-bang action, slapstick, magic and/or super heroes (like mine);2.  An appealing cast;3.  Situations that feel like something resembling reality: single parents doing their best to bring up their kids; young adults joining the military to get money for education and coming back from the Middle East with bodies and dreams maimed; nonprofits struggling to stay open in a bad economy4.  Positive images of people from a variety of backgrounds and abilities and disabilities5.  Positive values: family, community, perseverance, creativity, generosity, ethical behavior6.  An adorable dolphin you can't help but love; and7.  Considering the subject matter, a remarkably favorable balance of charm to treacle.Adults will see through some of the more heavy-handed plot devices, but that's OK.

1402230,A11M0G762OKA11,B004EPZ01G,"Mary Ann Ward ""snidelyward""","[7, 18]","OK. Did I like the film? Yes, I did, because my grandchildren loved it, so as soon as it appeared on Blu-Ray, I wanted it, but the words ""Ultraviolet Digital Copy"" made me hesitate. I purchased the same thing with the last installment of the Harry Potter film.Let's talk about Flixster. I couldn't get it to work, and yes, I'm old, but I understand technology. The complications were horrific. I found a ""helpline site,"" so I sent my complaint, reminding them that I wanted my digital copy as promised on the disk: one you could put on your computer, either Mac or IBM. It took a few days, and because I run Mac, they sent me an I-Tunes code. There was no problem. The wait was probably four or five days. My only complaint was that I wanted the film for a road trip with grandchildren, so I purchase a copy. I thought there would be no response. ""Live and Learn,"" I thought to myself.Within a day of that purchase, Flixster sent me a code for I-Tunes, so I had an extra copy.So I thought Dolphin Tale would be the same situation. I kept thinking somehow that they would have digital copies like they once did, like with Part I of the last Harry Potter film. The copy--unlike other studio offerings--expired within a period of time, but at least I could put it on my computer ""G drive,"" where I have confidence it would allow me to rely on it, if my computer crashed.I was mistaken. The digital copy for Dolphin Tale was impossible. First, I couldn't access my ""whatever"" they call it in this ""cloud"" or whatever. My password didn't work. My username didn't work. I couldn't reset anything. I couldn't even find a help center, and I would never have found that, if I hadn't kept the e-mail from the bad experience with the Harry Potter download.The wait began for me on Christmas Eve, days after the initial purchase. The opportunity to show it to grandchildren was gone. I kept thinking it would be nice to have it for another time. I sent more e-mails. They sent more, each time asking for bits of information. New Year's happened without resolution.I contacted the store, where I made the purchase. They informed me that I couldn't bring back the Blu-Ray package, since it had been opened, because it was against federal law to return something opened. Now that, is something I found interesting. Or at least it was until I continued the conversation. The store--national chain-- near my hometown gave me numbers for Warner Brothers. I called and left a message. Numerous requests to Flixster went unanswered.It was the first week of January, before they resolved the issue.Everything I've read so far, tells me that studios don't want consumers to have access to streamed movies like this, because they want to control illegal copying, which is the ultimate paradox. The hassle, the wait, and most importantly, the feeling of being ""ripped off"" tells most people just to get a ripper and take care of it.I paid good money for the Blu-Ray, DVD and digital copy. I will not do it again. Flixster eventually called me.First, they said they sent an e-mail on December 30 about having resolved the issue, but they felt that I didn't receive it, because my e-mail probably designated it as spam. I checked the account with spam, that had been filtered, and nothing was there from them.I'm glad they resolved it, but the whole spam thing is just another example of their way of making excuses for a product that doesn't deliver.According to my reading, Blu-Ray and DVD sales are ""in the cellar,"" and I'm sure this idea isn't going to help matters. For me personally, I refuse to purchase any digital copy package that has Warner or Ultraviolet printed on the cover. Interestingly enough, the large chain felt the same way.I admire them for their integrity. You see, they refuse to place a product that appears to be defective, or at best, one that doesn't deliver the promise it makes to purchasers.For me, I purchased tapes, DVD's, Blu-Rays and then I began downloading digital copies. I have enough films to entertain my grandchildren. I refuse to be ripped off by those, who feel that I will must buy another version.For purchasers, who want a digital copy, note my complaint, because I'm not the only one who feels this strongly. For purchasers, who only want a Blu-Ray copy, buy that.I will continue to give my business to I-Tunes, and if they come up with some similar cloud idea. that will be the end of my downloading experience as well.",1,Ultra Violet Mess,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,4442,"['OK.', 'Did', 'like', 'film', 'Yes', 'did', 'grandchildren', 'loved', 'so', 'as', 'soon', 'appeared', 'Blu-Ray', 'wanted', 'words', 'Ultraviolet', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'made', 'hesitate', 'purchased', 'same', 'thing', 'last', 'installment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film.Let', 'talk', 'Flixster', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'work', 'yes', ""'m"", 'old', 'understand', 'technology', 'complications', 'were', 'horrific', 'found', 'helpline', 'site', 'sent', 'complaint', 'reminding', 'wanted', 'digital', 'copy', 'promised', 'disk', 'one', 'could', 'put', 'computer', 'Mac', 'IBM', 'took', 'few', 'days', 'run', 'Mac', 'sent', 'I-Tunes', 'code', 'was', 'problem', 'wait', 'was', 'probably', 'four', 'five', 'days', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'wanted', 'film', 'road', 'trip', 'grandchildren', 'purchase', 'copy', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'response', 'Live', 'Learn', 'thought', 'myself.Within', 'day', 'purchase', 'Flixster', 'sent', 'code', 'I-Tunes', 'had', 'extra', 'copy.So', 'thought', 'Dolphin', 'Tale', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'situation', 'kept', 'thinking', 'somehow', 'would', 'have', 'digital', 'copies', 'once', 'did', 'Part', 'last', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'copy', 'other', 'studio', 'offerings', 'expired', 'period', 'time', 'least', 'could', 'put', 'computer', 'G', 'drive', 'where', 'have', 'confidence', 'would', 'allow', 'rely', 'computer', 'crashed.I', 'was', 'mistaken', 'digital', 'copy', 'Dolphin', 'Tale', 'was', 'impossible', 'First', 'could', ""n't"", 'access', 'call', 'cloud', 'password', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'username', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'could', ""n't"", 'reset', 'anything', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'help', 'center', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'found', 'had', ""n't"", 'kept', 'e-mail', 'bad', 'experience', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'download.The', 'wait', 'began', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'days', 'initial', 'purchase', 'opportunity', 'show', 'grandchildren', 'was', 'gone', 'kept', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'time', 'sent', 'more', 'e-mails', 'sent', 'more', 'time', 'asking', 'bits', 'information', 'New', 'Year', 'happened', 'resolution.I', 'contacted', 'store', 'where', 'made', 'purchase', 'informed', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', 'Blu-Ray', 'package', 'had', 'been', 'opened', 'was', 'federal', 'law', 'return', 'something', 'opened', 'Now', 'something', 'found', 'interesting', 'least', 'was', 'continued', 'conversation', 'store', 'national', 'chain', 'hometown', 'gave', 'numbers', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'called', 'left', 'message', 'Numerous', 'requests', 'Flixster', 'went', 'unanswered.It', 'was', 'first', 'week', 'January', 'resolved', 'issue.Everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'so', 'far', 'tells', 'studios', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'consumers', 'have', 'access', 'streamed', 'movies', 'want', 'control', 'illegal', 'copying', 'ultimate', 'paradox', 'hassle', 'wait', 'most', 'importantly', 'feeling', 'being', 'ripped', 'off', 'most', 'people', 'just', 'get', 'ripper', 'take', 'care', 'it.I', 'paid', 'good', 'money', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'again', 'Flixster', 'eventually', 'called', 'me.First', 'said', 'sent', 'e-mail', 'December', '30', 'having', 'resolved', 'issue', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'e-mail', 'probably', 'designated', 'spam', 'checked', 'account', 'spam', 'had', 'been', 'filtered', 'nothing', 'was', 'there', 'them.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'resolved', 'whole', 'spam', 'thing', 'just', 'example', 'way', 'making', 'excuses', 'product', ""n't"", 'deliver.According', 'reading', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'sales', 'are', 'cellar', ""'m"", 'sure', 'idea', ""n't"", 'going', 'help', 'matters', 'personally', 'refuse', 'purchase', 'digital', 'copy', 'package', 'Warner', 'Ultraviolet', 'printed', 'cover', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'large', 'chain', 'felt', 'same', 'way.I', 'admire', 'integrity', 'see', 'refuse', 'place', 'product', 'be', 'defective', 'best', 'one', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'promise', 'purchasers.For', 'purchased', 'tapes', 'DVD', 'Blu-Rays', 'then', 'began', 'downloading', 'digital', 'copies', 'have', 'enough', 'films', 'entertain', 'grandchildren', 'refuse', 'be', 'ripped', 'off', 'who', 'feel', 'will', 'must', 'buy', 'version.For', 'purchasers', 'who', 'want', 'digital', 'copy', 'note', 'complaint', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'strongly', 'purchasers', 'who', 'only', 'want', 'Blu-Ray', 'copy', 'buy', 'that.I', 'will', 'continue', 'give', 'business', 'I-Tunes', 'come', 'up', 'similar', 'cloud', 'idea', 'will', 'be', 'end', 'downloading', 'experience', 'as', 'well']",Dolphin Tale

1402236,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B004EPZ01G,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","""Dolphin Tale"" is a family film, suitable for adults too, inspired by the true story of Winter, a bottlenose dolphin who lost her tail in an accident and had to learn to swim with a prosthetic. 11-year-old Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) is feeling down after his cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell) leaves to serve in the Army and he must attend summer school after failing English. One day, Sawyer comes to the aid of a fisherman who has found a dolphin caught in a crab trap. The animal is removed to Clearwater Marine Hospital, under the care of Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick, Jr.), whose adventurous daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) names it ""Winter"". Winter can swim without a tail, but the unnatural movement is damaging her spine. Sawyer enlists the assistance of Dr. McCarthy (Morgan Freeman) from a nearby veteran's rehabilitation hospital in hopes of fitting Winter with a prosthetic.Many changes have been made to the real story of Winter, who currently resides at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Florida. One of the most notable is the addition of children, Sawyer and Hazel, in consideration of a younger audience. Writers Karen Janszen and Noam Dromi have packed the film with themes and dramas far beyond that of Winter's plight. We have a marine rehab center on the verge of bankruptcy due to poor economic conditions, then struck by a hurricane. Sawyer is rewarded for doing something meaningful rather than attending school, in which he has little interest. The amputees at the veteran's hospital are inspired by Winter's success. And that's just for starters.To the filmmakers' credit, none of this overwhelms the urgency of Winter's situation or her charm. But I think the writers over-packed this script more than a little. I like the children. Chatterbox Hazel is especially charming. The Harry Potter books and movies have made bright, adventurous children who don't always follow the rules into something of a ideal, which is reflected in ""Dolphin Tale"". It's entertaining. The evolution of the prosthetic is interesting -and I understand it is realistic, though what took over a year is compressed into a few weeks. Winter is a delightful movie star. Kids will love it, and adults won't be bored. My only criticism is that the story is so over-packed that it beggars belief.",4,"Charming, Inspirational, Fun for the Whole Family -if a Little Too Much of a Good Thing.",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,2289,"['Dolphin', 'Tale', 'family', 'film', 'suitable', 'adults', 'too', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'Winter', 'bottlenose', 'dolphin', 'who', 'lost', 'tail', 'accident', 'had', 'learn', 'swim', 'prosthetic', '11-year-old', 'Sawyer', 'Nathan', 'Gamble', 'feeling', 'down', 'cousin', 'Kyle', 'Austin', 'Stowell', 'serve', 'Army', 'must', 'attend', 'summer', 'school', 'failing', 'English', 'One', 'day', 'Sawyer', 'aid', 'fisherman', 'who', 'found', 'dolphin', 'caught', 'crab', 'trap', 'animal', 'removed', 'Clearwater', 'Marine', 'Hospital', 'care', 'Dr.', 'Clay', 'Haskett', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'adventurous', 'daughter', 'Hazel', 'Cozi', 'Zuehlsdorff', 'Winter', 'Winter', 'can', 'swim', 'tail', 'unnatural', 'movement', 'damaging', 'spine', 'Sawyer', 'assistance', 'Dr.', 'McCarthy', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'nearby', 'veteran', 'rehabilitation', 'hospital', 'hopes', 'fitting', 'Winter', 'prosthetic.Many', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'real', 'story', 'Winter', 'who', 'currently', 'Clearwater', 'Marine', 'Aquarium', 'Florida', 'One', 'most', 'notable', 'addition', 'children', 'Sawyer', 'Hazel', 'consideration', 'younger', 'audience', 'Writers', 'Karen', 'Janszen', 'Noam', 'Dromi', 'have', 'packed', 'film', 'themes', 'dramas', 'far', 'Winter', 'plight', 'have', 'marine', 'rehab', 'center', 'verge', 'bankruptcy', 'due', 'poor', 'economic', 'conditions', 'then', 'struck', 'hurricane', 'Sawyer', 'rewarded', 'doing', 'something', 'meaningful', 'rather', 'attending', 'school', 'little', 'interest', 'amputees', 'veteran', 'hospital', 'are', 'inspired', 'Winter', 'success', 'just', 'starters.To', 'filmmakers', 'credit', 'none', 'urgency', 'Winter', 'situation', 'charm', 'think', 'writers', 'over-packed', 'script', 'more', 'little', 'children', 'Chatterbox', 'Hazel', 'especially', 'charming', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'movies', 'have', 'made', 'bright', 'adventurous', 'children', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'follow', 'rules', 'something', 'ideal', 'reflected', 'Dolphin', 'Tale', 'entertaining', 'evolution', 'prosthetic', 'interesting', '-and', 'understand', 'realistic', 'what', 'took', 'over', 'year', 'compressed', 'few', 'weeks', 'Winter', 'delightful', 'movie', 'star', 'Kids', 'will', 'love', 'adults', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bored', 'only', 'criticism', 'story', 'so', 'over-packed', 'belief']",Dolphin Tale
1402237,A2M85JGCPOR97Y,B004EPZ01G,Misterbanks,"[2, 3]","This was the best movie of 2011. It is dramatic, comedic, fun, emotional all at the same time, and does it all very well. It is very family friendly, appeals to kids very easily, also it appeals to adults very easily. It also has a strong pull for veterans and disabled people. People can relate to a dolphin with a prosthetic tale and the main character's cousin who comes home from war with a disability.The acting is top notch. I have to say the young lead, Nathan Gamble, really stuck out as the best of the bunch. He acted every scene and every line, and every expression to the 't'. He has a bright future as an actor and will have no problem becoming as well known a star as his co-stars are now. Morgan Freeman was his usual fun and endearing self with a whimsical twist. Ashley Judd was very good as usual. The other young co-star, Cozi Zuelsdorf, made a very good start with her debut role, and should succeed should she choose to go on acting. Harry Connick Jr. was a fun character and made his usual top notch performance, he even got to flex his musician muscles for a scene. Winter the Dolphin who plays herself will even captivate your attention with her own unique personality.Also the cinematography was grade-A outstanding!!This movie is a hear-felt, fun, dramatic and inspiring movie. People may compare it to other aquatic-themed movies, but once they've seen it, they will agree it stands apart as unique and wonderful.I would give this movie a 20 out of 10 but this site won't let me.

This was my first combo DVD/Blu Ray/Digital where it is an ultraviolet digital copy.

But this one... BUYER BEWARE... it only allows you to stream the video through Flixter.  This doesn't help when you're in the car and don't have an internet connection.  I need a digital copy my kids can watch on their iPods while we are traveling in the car.  So, this combo pack is a complete waste of time.  I would have done better to purchase the DVD and burn my own digital copy to the iPods.  I will know better next time.

A young boy helps rescue a dolphin from the beach, but its damaged tail-fin must be amputated. They develop a bond, and he develops a bond of friendship with the daughter of the animal hospital's manager. There are many moments of eager anticipation, bitter disappointment, and teary-eyed joy. **SPOILER**There are about three almost-romantic relationships that are barely hinted at, but the friendships and family relationships are fulfilling on their own.**/SPOILER** There is nothing I noticed that would be inappropriate for children.THE PACKAGEFor me, the 4-disc package was not worth the extra $10. This one-disc version includes a few nice bonus features, and the ability to get an 'UltraViolet' version of the movie.

1402260,ABC8FXLD7W528,B004EPZ01G,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[2, 3]","Dolphin Tale is a movie that will warm your heart (and have your child asking if they please have a pet dolphin at home!  It is based on a true story and begins with an injured dolphin (nothing graphic is shown) who is rescued by a marine hospital. The discovery of the dolphin, named Winter, couldn't come at a better time for Sawyer, a young boy who has just said goodbye to his beloved older cousin Kyle. Kyle has been called into active duty, leaving Sawyer feeling alone and discouraged. However, it isn't long before Sawyer and Winter form a special bond.Without many friends and missing Kyle (who also is somewhat like a fatherly role model to the fatherless Sawyer), the sweet and outgoing Hazel, is a welcome friend. She and her father, Gary, who is a marine hospital doctor, join Sawyer and several others in the effort to save Winter.I loved the wonderful show of family unity in this movie. Sawyer, his mom, aunt, and Kyle are all very close. Hazel and her dad and grandpa are also close. When Kyle returns home from active duty with a severe injury, his family rallies around him. Friendship plays a huge role in this film and a doctor from the VA not only befriends those trying to save Winter, but also joins in the fight. Another thing I enjoyed about this movie was the positive light shed on homeschooling.Winter becomes an inspiration to all, but especially those with physical disabilities. A little girl in a wheelchair travels with her mother eight hours to see Winter, thus opening an excellent opportunity for discussion of how we are to show compassion to others. Kyle, struggling with his depression from the life-changing injury he received, is inspired by Winter as well. Another great discussion topic of how we should always be mindful and grateful of what our soldiers endure just to ensure our freedoms.I would highly recommend this movie for the entire family. It is a movie that will stay with you long after the closing credits! I have added this movie to my Mom-Approved Movie Listings on my Wordpress blog.Reviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of ""77 ways Your Family Can Make a Difference.""",5,A Must See for the Entire Family!,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,2123,"['Dolphin', 'Tale', 'movie', 'will', 'warm', 'heart', 'have', 'child', 'asking', 'please', 'have', 'pet', 'dolphin', 'home', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'injured', 'dolphin', 'nothing', 'graphic', 'shown', 'who', 'rescued', 'marine', 'hospital', 'discovery', 'dolphin', 'named', 'Winter', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'better', 'time', 'Sawyer', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'said', 'goodbye', 'beloved', 'older', 'cousin', 'Kyle', 'Kyle', 'been', 'called', 'active', 'duty', 'leaving', 'Sawyer', 'feeling', 'alone', 'discouraged', 'However', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Sawyer', 'Winter', 'form', 'special', 'bond.Without', 'many', 'friends', 'missing', 'Kyle', 'who', 'also', 'somewhat', 'fatherly', 'role', 'model', 'fatherless', 'Sawyer', 'sweet', 'outgoing', 'Hazel', 'welcome', 'friend', 'father', 'Gary', 'who', 'marine', 'hospital', 'doctor', 'join', 'Sawyer', 'several', 'others', 'effort', 'save', 'Winter.I', 'loved', 'wonderful', 'show', 'family', 'unity', 'movie', 'Sawyer', 'mom', 'aunt', 'Kyle', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'Hazel', 'dad', 'grandpa', 'are', 'also', 'close', 'When', 'Kyle', 'home', 'active', 'duty', 'severe', 'injury', 'family', 'Friendship', 'huge', 'role', 'film', 'doctor', 'VA', 'not', 'only', 'trying', 'save', 'Winter', 'also', 'fight', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'positive', 'light', 'shed', 'homeschooling.Winter', 'inspiration', 'especially', 'physical', 'disabilities', 'little', 'girl', 'wheelchair', 'mother', 'eight', 'hours', 'see', 'Winter', 'thus', 'opening', 'excellent', 'opportunity', 'discussion', 'how', 'are', 'show', 'compassion', 'others', 'Kyle', 'struggling', 'depression', 'life-changing', 'injury', 'received', 'inspired', 'Winter', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'discussion', 'topic', 'how', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'mindful', 'grateful', 'what', 'soldiers', 'endure', 'just', 'ensure', 'freedoms.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'closing', 'have', 'added', 'movie', 'Mom-Approved', 'Movie', 'Listings', 'Wordpress', 'blog.Reviewed', 'Penny', 'Zeller', 'Author', '77', 'ways', 'Family', 'Can', 'Make', 'Difference']",Dolphin Tale

1402297,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004EPZ01G,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[37, 42]","Dolphin Tale is, first and foremost, a great family movie. What I mean by that is that everyone - kids and adults alike - can enjoy it and never feel either bored or like they're being talked down to.  A lot of craftsmanship went into the making of this movie and it shows, mainly in how seamlessly it flows and how well everything fits together.The movie centers around the true story of Winter, a young bottlenose dolphin found on a beach in coastal Florida whose tail was injured and ended up having to be amputated. The humans taking care of Winter ultimately had to create a prosthetic tail in order for her to survive, and in the process she became an inspiration to many, from children who were born missing a limb to veterans who had lost limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan.In Dolphin Tale, the plot begins with Sawyer (Nathan Gamble), a young boy who's been withdrawn ever since his father left the family five years earlier and who's having to deal with his older cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell), who's been like a brother to him, leaving to do a tour in Afghanistan. Which leaves Sawyer even more lonely and withdrawn, until one day he happens to come across a dolphin stranded on the beach.  The dolphin is injured, its tail caught in a crab trap which has washed up along with it. Sawyer cuts the dolphin free of the trap, animal rescue is called and the local aquarium comes and takes the dolphin away for treatment.Curious, Sawyer later goes to the aquarium to check on the dolphin, sneaking into the Employees Only area where he runs into Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff), the young daughter of the aquarium's resident vet, Dr. Haskett (Harry Connick, Jr).  Hazel, who is as extroverted and chatty as Sawyer is withdrawn and shy, takes him out to the tank where the dolphin - now named Winter - is being treated.  Winter, who had been lethargic and unresponsive, seems to perk up at the sound of Sawyer's voice, apparently recognizing him as the one who cut her free, and gradually Sawyer becomes part of the team of humans trying to save her.  Which he does by playing hookey from summer school and spending his days at the aquarium, without telling his mother (Ashley Judd) who is furious when she gets a call from the school asking where Sawyer has been. But when she sees how much the experience is drawing her son out of himself for the first time and he's actually emotionally connecting with people once again, she decides to let him continue.The damage to Winter's tail, however, is too severe and Dr. Haskett ends up having to amputate it, which makes them all wonder if Winter will be able to survive. In the meantime, Kyle has returned from Afghanistan after having been badly injured and is having to undergo physical therapy and learning to walk with a leg brace.  While visiting Kyle at the VA hospital, Sawyer meets Dr. McCarthy (Morgan Freeman), who works with the veterans who need prosthetic limbs. Sawyer then draws Dr. McCarthy into the project of designing and building a prosthetic tail for Winter.  And in the background, the aquarium is facing threats from budget problems which only worsen when a tropical storm wreaks havoc on the place.There are admittedly in Dolphin Tale a number of Hollywood embellishments to Winter's story that frequently border on the formulaic, and at times the relentless optimism that permeates the film seems a bit much, but it is a mark of how well the film was written and directed that I never felt bothered by them. As director, Smith shows a deft hand at pacing and at balancing drama and humor so that you're always engaged in the film.  He also seems to know exactly how to work with animals - in this case the dolphin Winter (who played herself) and a comically territorial pelican named Rufus.  Smith also has a fine eye for knowing just how to photograph animals to bring out their personalities, which may have come from his own experience working with wolves in the 1983 film Never Cry Wolf.  The scenes between Sawyer and Winter, particularly the underwater ones, are beautifully crafted, and one genuinely experiences what it is to be in that special world where dolphin and human connect with each other.Credit should also be given to the particularly fine performances by Nathan Gamble as Sawyer, Cozi Zuehlsdorff as Hazel, and Ashley Judd as Sawyer's mom, all of whom make their characters fresh and believable, which carry the emotional core of the movie without a hitch or a stumble.  At 12, Gamble is already a veteran actor with appearances in films like Babel, The Mist, and The Dark Knight and numerous TV shows). The supporting cast is also excellent.  Harry Connick, Jr is convincing as Dr. Haskett, the aquarium vet and Hazel's father, and you can see him noticing how Winter responds to Sawyer and recognizing that Sawyer seems to have a natural gift for working with animals... and then weighing whether he should involve a boy that young in something this serious.  Kris Kristofferson does a nice low-key job as Haskett's father and Hazel's grandfather, offering calm advice and reassurance when it's needed. Austin Stowell is good as Kyle, Sawyer's cousin and a former champion swimmer who now has to deal with that part of his life effectively being over. And a number of familiar veteran character actors fill in various roles - Frances Sternhagen as Gloria, the administrator having to deal with the aquarium's financial problems, Richard Libertini as the fisherman who finds Winter along with Sawyer, and Ray McKinnon as Sawyer's harried summer school teacher.On a side note, I saw the 3D version of the movie, and I can actually say that, unlike most 3D films, Dolphin Tale actually made some nicely effective use of the 3D technology, particularly when the shots that take place underwater and in the part of the film where they're working on the design of Winter's prosthetic tail and the blueprints take shape, showing how they're supposed to fit and function.  And again in a throwaway but nonetheless fun scene involving Sawyer's remote-controlled model helicopter buzzing out of control around and through the aquarium.Highly recommended as a good, solid all-round enjoyable family film.",5,A well-crafted tale that everyone can enjoy,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,6182,"['Dolphin', 'Tale', 'first', 'foremost', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'What', 'mean',

1402302,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B004EPZ01G,Z Hayes,"[70, 77]","My husband and I took our first-grader to watch this beautiful, uplifting movie this past weekend and had the most wonderful time. When the movie ended, the audience broke out in spontaneous applause, that's how much this movie affected all of us. Dolphin Tale is the story of overcoming the odds, of love between family and love among friends, and of courage and resilience.Set in Clearwater, Florida and inspired by a true story (yes, there is a real Winter the Dolphin!), the story centers on a young boy Sawyer (Nathan Gamble in a finely nuanced performance) who is portrayed as being despondent at the beginning of the movie - he is sad that his cousin,Kyle (Austin Stowell) a champion swimmer is going away to serve the country as a soldier. Kyle is Sawyer's role model and mentor, and the closest thing he has to a 'dad' figure given his own father left the family when he was very young. Sawyer's mom, Lorraine (Ashely Judd) tries her best to cope and provide for Sawyer, but she can't seem to bring Sawyer out of his doldrums. Sawyer is also very unhappy that he has to attend summer school, but something happens to change the way Sawyer views life.One day, Sawyer comes across a stranded, injured dolphin and the amazing journey begins...soon enough, Sawyer is volunteering at the Clearwater Marine Rescue facility, headed by Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick, Jr.), and the young boy finally sees a reason to be enthusiastic about life. He befriends Clay's young daughter, Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) and forms a close bond with Winter the dolphin. Unfortunately, the marine facility is in financial trouble and faces the threat of being bought out by a developer. Added to this is the sad fact that Winter, having lost her tail, may eventually face paralysis. Morgan Freeman plays a doctor who designs prosthetics for injured war vets, and whose unwavering perseverance plays a prominent role in the movie.There's something in this movie that captures the imagination and interest of both children and adults. The antics of the dolphin, and the children's interactions between themselves and the dolphin will keep young children entertained and older children engaged. The riveting storyline, and the tension and drama keep the adults engaged as well. This truly falls into the category of ""family entertainment"". We did not watch it in 3D, but loved the movie all the same. Another friend who did watch it in 3D enjoyed the extra effects, so we might go back and watch it again. I will certainly be purchasing the DVD when it is released and adding it to our home DVD library.The messages in this movie are timely and evergreen - of resilience, hope, love, overcoming the odds, and of course, conservation.
