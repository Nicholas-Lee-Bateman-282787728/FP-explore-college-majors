With that said, there is nothing b-movie about this. I love the whole playing on reality that will make people look up to see if Dirt Boy is indeed a true novel. That's the kind of genius Lovecraft, Stephen King and Clive Barker possess.The movie looks great, sounds great, has some great music. The only negative is some occasional weak acting but it's totally forgivable.A whole town obsessed with a book because of its success and the prosperity it brings, sort of like living near Area 51 or the house Ed Gein lived in. I'm sure it's a love/hate relationship for those folks--you hate the reason people come but you benefit from their business. Only in this town, people LOVE the attention and really own it.

Along the way, he listens to a book on tape about the Atwater Commons murderer known only as DIRT BOY. While in Atwater Commons, Matty discovers a local radio station playing the DIRT BOY story on a daily basis. He listens intently to the exploits of the title character. Matty soon finds himself retracing the killer's steps, and visiting the murder sites in the story. He even digs up one of the victims' graves, and it has a fresh corpse in it! Matty continues to follow DIRT BOY's trail, and finds another body! Atwater residents become offended, believing that Matty is ruining the town's reputation and bringing unwanted attention. The story of DIRT BOY appears to be the only concern of the entire town! Matty hears what he believes to be a radio DJ telling someone to cover their tracks. It's even spoken in code! What the hell is going on? Is a copy cat on the loose? Is there some sort of town-wide conspiracy, or is Matty losing his grip on reality?

The reaction of the town to his discovery is pretty amusing. It kept me engaged as I tried, along with the protag, to figure out the secret. The gradual reveals were well plotted, moving the pace along. Its a quiet kind of film, more of an experience for the mind than a visceral sensory based movie. I remained a spectator throughout, never forgetting I was watching a movie, unsure if it was due to the incredulity of the story (not meant as a criticism), or the acting (which was mainly adequate but kind of tongue in cheek for some characters), A decent choice for a low key afternoon, not a prime time hour.",4,"Horror Junkie's review: 3.5 really, a sleepy afternoon kind of film",1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,727,"['Dirt', 'Boy', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'protagonist', 'searching', 'answers', 'stumbles', 'secret', 'reaction', 'town', 'discovery', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'kept', 'engaged', 'tried', 'protag', 'figure', 'out', 'secret', 'gradual', 'reveals', 'were', 'well', 'plotted', 'moving', 'pace', 'along', 'quiet', 'kind', 'film', 'more', 'experience', 'mind', 'visceral', 'sensory', 'based', 'movie', 'remained', 'spectator', 'never', 'forgetting', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'unsure', 'was', 'due', 'incredulity', 'story', 'not', 'meant', 'criticism', 'acting', 'was', 'mainly', 'adequate', 'kind', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'characters', 'decent', 'choice', 'low', 'key', 'afternoon', 'not', 'prime', 'time', 'hour']",N/A

701535,A13V0W9U52ML9K,B000066C7C,moxycat,"[13, 13]","The sparse synopsis and only 1 review compelled me to watch this film so that I could review it.  Overall it was not bad.  A plodding psychological thriller, there is minimal gore (corpses) so I'm not exactly sure it falls under the 'horror' category.The story is about Mr. Matthews, an ex-drug addict from New York who attends a criminology seminar in Atwater Commons, near Cape Cod, in order to 'understand the death of his mother'.  At first I assumed she was the victim of a serial killer because, you know, that would make sense.  Or that at least he was directly responsible for her death and feared he may be a serial killer.  But no, she died in a car accident.  So there's confusing plot point #1.Atwater Commons is home to Atwater Bridges, author of the popular serial killer account 'Dirt Boy'.  The book is supposedly fiction, but the story treats it as if it's historical fact at times...Confusing plot point #2.  Especially when Mr. Matthews, with no law enforcement background whatsoever, begins retracing the steps of the 'fictional' Dirt Boy and discovering corpses in the exact locations described.  The first one I can almost buy, but then a second such occurrence?  I wouldn't have gone corpse hunting again for fear of seeming suspicious, and since law enforcement was called to the scene I WOULD look pretty suspicious.  Plus the fact that, upon discovery of the first body, it was the amateur searching for more and not actual police.  If a scene in a 'fictional' book turned out to be true the first thing I would do as a detective would be to scour the other scenes described....Confusing plot point #3.But the townspeople are so loaded due to sales of the book (almost $100k annually for the town library and $150k for carpenters) it is implied that the townspeople are covering up the truth, but never really explained to what extent.  In reality the author himself of 1 popular book wouldn't even be earning that much, and God only knows how one book could pump that much revenue into a town....Confusing plot point #4.  When the true murders become public the book is banned and the tourist season takes a hit. This really angers the townsfolk.  In reality if 'fictional' murders turned out to be true, book sales would soar and MORE tourists would flock to the place....Confusing plot point #5.Mr. Matthews is on the trail of a bona fide serial killer and persists despite the creepy, ominous neighborhood kid, the warning of a detective in the same seminar, an attempt on his own life and other major red flags that would certainly send me packing back to New York.  At times you wonder 'Is Mr. Matthews the killer, inspired by the book?'  'Is Atwater Bridges, the nutty author, living out his own story?'  'Is the killer one, or all, of the creepy town residents?'I won't ruin the ending, because most of the plot IS explained (with only 30 mins left in the movie and still no resolution, I was kinda worried).  Not a bad movie, but be prepared to suspend belief.  Don't watch this if you're expecting true horror, if you've ever worked in law enforcement, or if (like me) you tend to over-analyze details in movies that would never happen in real life.",2,Confusing & unrealistic....but not bad,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,3185,"['sparse', 'synopsis', 'only', '1', 'review', 'compelled', 'watch', 'film', 'could', 'review', 'Overall', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'plodding', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'minimal', 'gore', 'corpses', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', ""'horror"", 'category.The', 'story', 'Mr.', 'Matthews', 'ex-drug', 'addict', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'criminology', 'seminar', 'Atwater', 'Commons', 'Cape', 'Cod', 'order', ""'understand"", 'death', 'mother', 'first', 'assumed', 'was', 'victim', 'serial', 'killer', 'know', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'least', 'was', 'directly', 'responsible', 'death', 'feared', 'may', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'confusing', 'plot', 'point', '1.Atwater', 'Commons', 'home', 'Atwater', 'Bridges', 'author', 'popular', 'serial', 'killer', 'account', 'Boy', 'book', 'supposedly', 'fiction', 'story', 'historical', 'fact', 'times', 'Confusing', 'plot', 'point', '2', 'Especially', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Matthews', 'law', 'enforcement', 'background', 'whatsoever', 'retracing', 'steps', ""'fictional"", 'Dirt', 'Boy', 'discovering', 'corpses', 'exact', 'locations', 'described', 'first', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'buy', 'then', 'second', 'such', 'occurrence', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'corpse', 'hunting', 'again', 'fear', 'seeming', 'suspicious', 'law', 'enforcement', 'was', 'called', 'scene', 'WOULD', 'look', 'pretty', 'suspicious', 'fact', 'discovery', 'first', 'body', 'was', 'amateur', 'searching', 'more', 'not', 'actual', 'police', 'scene', ""'fictional"", 'book', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'first', 'thing', 'would', 'do', 'detective', 'would', 'be', 'scour', 'other', 'scenes', 'described', '.Confusing', 'plot', 'point', '3.But', 'townspeople', 'are', 'so', 'loaded', 'due', 'sales', 'book', 'almost', '100k', 'annually', 'town', 'library', '150k', 'carpenters', 'implied', 'townspeople', 'are', 'covering', 'up', 'truth', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'what', 'extent', 'reality', 'author', '1', 'popular', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'earning', 'much', 'God', 'only', 'how', 'one', 'book', 'could', 'pump', 'that', 'much', 'revenue', 'town', '.Confusing', 'plot', 'point', '4', 'When', 'true', 'murders', 'become', 'public', 'book', 'banned', 'tourist', 'season', 'hit', 'really', 'townsfolk', 'reality', ""'fictional"", 'murders', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'book', 'sales', 'would', 'soar', 'MORE', 'tourists', 'would', 'flock', 'place', '.Confusing', 'plot', 'point', '5.Mr', 'Matthews', 'trail', 'bona', 'fide', 'serial', 'killer', 'creepy', 'ominous', 'neighborhood', 'kid', 'warning', 'detective', 'same', 'seminar', 'attempt', 'own', 'life', 'other', 'major', 'red', 'flags', 'would', 'certainly', 'send', 'packing', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'times', 'wonder', 'Mr.', 'Matthews', 'killer', 'inspired', 'book', 'Atwater', 'Bridges', 'nutty', 'author', 'living', 'out', 'own', 'story', 'killer', 'one', 'creepy', 'town', 'residents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'ending', 'most', 'plot', 'IS', 'explained', 'only', '30', 'mins', 'left', 'movie', 'still', 'resolution', 'was', 'kinda', 'worried', 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'be', 'prepared', 'suspend', 'belief', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'true', 'horror', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'worked', 'law', 'enforcement', 'tend', 'over-analyze', 'details', 'movies', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'life']",N/A

DB is NOT a horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller that revolves around an ex-junky a one hit wonder author and the odd little town the author lives. The town and its residents are beholden to the author for the astronomical amount of money (this makes no sense) his books revenues brings to them. Mr. Matthews is a lost soul looking for understanding and forgiveness in regards to the loss of his mother in a car accident. He visits Atwater Commons to attend a two week seminar on understanding serial killers and their apprehension which is odd to say the least since his mom died in a car accident. I am not sure why this would help him heal from his loss or maybe it is some weird way for him to help understand death and its effects on people? I just don't see the link to serial killer seminar except for the book DB that he doesn't know about until he arrives in the town? Matthews character gets caught up in the Dirt Boy book and starts to investigate the books murders (I guess he was driven from the seminar) and guess what he finds ??? The story keeps getting more bizarre with his discovery from the reactions of the locals as well as the lack of a visible law enforcement presence and their actions. I was going to give some detailed info on all the bizarre quirks in this story, but that would reveal to much so I won't. This story loosely reminds me of a Stephen King story only a lot more disjointed and lacking a much needed polishing job for clarification and cohesion. I say that becauce of the small New England town feel, his older car (not a classic) and the strange story. So I've listed a few of the oddities that present themselves in this story to give you an idea of what you are up against as a guide to the bizarre nature of this story. The acting and direction are good, but as described before the story needs work and in the hands of a good writer I think that this would make for a great movie. I must say that even with all the quirks in the writing I still enjoyed this movie and its odd ball characters and its little town full of mysterious residents. I seldom will enjoy a movie that has so many quirks in the writing or a combination of issues that include acting, direction, editing and so on. I hope if you give this movie a try that you can overlook its flaws and still be able to enjoy the story as is unfolds to its conclusion. 3 starsRating 0 to 5Story = 3 The hard way.Acting = 3.5Direction = 3Fear Factor = 1Gore = .5Sex/Nudity = NO and NoFoul Language = Not muchEntertainment Value = 3",3,Dirt Boy Fact or Fiction???,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,2726,"['Dirt', 'Boy', 'was', 'mix', 'bag', 'odd', 'parameters', 'infused', 'story', 'aimed', 'adding', 'mystery', 'believability', 'enhance', 'causation', 'chain', 'events', 'led', 'murders', 'DB', 'NOT', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'ex-junky', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'author', 'odd', 'little', 'town', 'author', 'town', 'residents', 'are', 'beholden', 'author', 'astronomical', 'amount', 'money', 'sense', 'books', 'revenues', 'brings', 'Mr.', 'Matthews', 'lost', 'soul', 'looking', 'understanding', 'forgiveness', 'regards', 'loss', 'mother', 'car', 'accident', 'Atwater', 'Commons', 'attend', 'two', 'week', 'seminar', 'understanding', 'serial', 'killers', 'apprehension', 'odd', 'say', 'least', 'mom', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'would', 'help', 'heal', 'loss', 'maybe', 'weird', 'way', 'help', 'understand', 'death', 'effects', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'link', 'serial', 'killer', 'seminar', 'book', 'DB', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'town', 'Matthews', 'character', 'caught', 'up', 'Dirt', 'Boy', 'book', 'investigate', 'books', 'murders', 'guess', 'was', 'driven', 'seminar', 'guess', 'what', 'story', 'getting', 'more', 'bizarre', 'discovery', 'reactions', 'locals', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'visible', 'law', 'enforcement', 'presence', 'actions', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'detailed', 'info', 'bizarre', 'quirks', 'story', 'would', 'reveal', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'story', 'loosely', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'only', 'lot', 'more', 'disjointed', 'lacking', 'much', 'needed', 'polishing', 'job', 'clarification', 'cohesion', 'say', 'becauce', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'feel', 'older', 'car', 'not', 'classic', 'strange', 'story', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'few', 'oddities', 'present', 'story', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'are', 'up', 'guide', 'bizarre', 'nature', 'story', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'good', 'described', 'story', 'work', 'hands', 'good', 'writer', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'even', 'quirks', 'writing', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'odd', 'ball', 'characters', 'little', 'town', 'full', 'mysterious', 'residents', 'seldom', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'quirks', 'writing', 'combination', 'issues', 'include', 'acting', 'direction', 'editing', 'so', 'hope', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'can', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'story', 'unfolds', 'conclusion', '3', 'starsRating', '0', '5Story', '=', '3', 'hard', 'way.Acting', '3.5Direction', '3Fear', 'Factor', '=', '1Gore', '=', '.5Sex/Nudity', '=', 'NO', 'NoFoul', 'Language', '=', 'Not', 'muchEntertainment', 'Value', '=', '3']",N/A
