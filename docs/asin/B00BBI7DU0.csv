Television networks rarely know when they have a good thing and such was the case for HARRY O.  Regardless, THANK YOU Warner Archive for releasing HARRY O on DVD!  Hopefully--before this decade is out--there will be a DVD release of David Janssen's RICHARD DIAMOND, PRIVATE DETECTIVE (a.k.a. CALL MR. D) TV series as well.

1624253,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B00BBI7DU0,Gary P. Cohen,"[7, 8]","I can still remember the shock I felt upon reading that Harry O had been cancelled.  The series was doing well in the ratings and beating its competition, the mediocre Barnaby Jones on CBS.  Yet the series was cancelled with no explanation other than that a new regime had taken over at ABC and didn't like it. (We learned this later.)  Anyway, I always felt that the second season of Harry O was superior to the first.  The series had worked out its kinks and the great David Janssen worked well with Anthony Zerbe as Lt. Trench.  Zerbe won a supporting actor Emmy for this role.  (Isn't it amazing that David Janssen, tv's greatest actor as far as I'm concerned, never won an Emmy for either this series or The Fugitive?)In conclusion, I'm happy that this series has been released so that others can discover tv's greatest Private Detective  as well as most prematurely cancelled series.",5,The Second Season for a Truly Great Series,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,889,"['can', 'still', 'remember', 'shock', 'felt', 'reading', 'Harry', 'O', 'had', 'been', 'cancelled', 'series', 'was', 'doing', 'well', 'ratings', 'beating', 'competition', 'mediocre', 'Barnaby', 'Jones', 'CBS', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'explanation', 'other', 'new', 'regime', 'had', 'taken', 'over', 'ABC', 'did', ""n't"", 'learned', 'later', 'Anyway', 'always', 'felt', 'second', 'season', 'Harry', 'O', 'was', 'superior', 'first', 'series', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'kinks', 'great', 'David', 'Janssen', 'worked', 'well', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Lt.', 'Trench', 'Zerbe', 'won', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Emmy', 'role', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'David', 'Janssen', 'tv', 'greatest', 'actor', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'never', 'won', 'Emmy', 'either', 'series', 'Fugitive', 'conclusion', ""'m"", 'happy', 'series', 'been', 'released', 'so', 'others', 'can', 'discover', 'tv', 'greatest', 'Private', 'Detective', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'prematurely', 'cancelled', 'series']",Harry O: The Complete Second Season

Now, it's even better, being able to view it as an adult.I have both Harry O Season 1 and Season 2 and love them both, but I think the show got even better in the second season. The stories are so engaging, with great guest stars.David Janssen is one of my favorite actors of all time. Loved watching him in The Fugitive and many movies. And Anthony Zerbe is great in this series too as Lt. Trench.Their on/off again friendship and rivalry adds so much to each episode.I stopped watching TV shows of all kinds, a few years ago because this kind of quality entertainment seems to be a thing of the past on the tube. Sad that there was only 2 seasons for Harry O but at least now fans can enjoy it again, with these DVDs.Buy both DVDs, you won't be sorry.

K.C. Trench, interplay that helped Anthony Zerbe win an Emmy.  Orwell solves cases involving a varierty of clinets, but the series' charm lay in Orwell, a burned out former San Diego cop injured in a liquor store robbery.  Orwell's inability to find happiness is illustrated in the episode &#34;Reflections&#34; when a candidate for high state court is being blackmailed by a former mental hospital intern and the candidate's wife is Harry's former wife, and having to help her brings out in Harry that he still loves her and can't love another woman as a result.Harry also has to deal with wannabe-detective Lester Hodges.  This leads to the series' funniest episode &#34;Mister Five and Dime&#34; where Lester gets Harry and Trench mixed up with varied federal investigators searching for a gang of armored car thieves who also kidnap a maker of funny money.Harry periodically gets rescued by Trench and always gets the upper hand on the lieutenant, and the relationship between the two is always crackerjack.",4,Harry O's Superb Second Season,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,1168,"['Harry', 'O', 'concluded', '1975-6', 'season', 'highlighted', 'superb', 'interplay', 'David', 'Janssen', 'private', 'detective', 'Harry', 'Orwell', 'LAPD', 'nemesis', 'Lt.', 'K.C', 'Trench', 'interplay', 'helped', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'win', 'Emmy', 'Orwell', 'cases', 'involving', 'varierty', 'clinets', 'series', 'charm', 'lay', 'Orwell', 'burned', 'out', 'former', 'San', 'Diego', 'cop', 'injured', 'liquor', 'store', 'robbery', 'Orwell', 'inability', 'find', 'happiness', 'illustrated', 'episode', '34', 'Reflections', '34', 'when', 'candidate', 'high', 'state', 'court', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'former', 'mental', 'hospital', 'intern', 'candidate', 'wife', 'Harry', 'former', 'wife', 'having', 'help', 'brings', 'out', 'Harry', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'woman', 'result.Harry', 'also', 'deal', 'wannabe-detective', 'Lester', 'Hodges', 'series', 'funniest', 'episode', '34', 'Mister', 'Five', 'Dime', '34', 'where', 'Lester', 'Harry', 'Trench', 'mixed', 'up', 'varied', 'federal', 'investigators', 'searching', 'gang', 'armored', 'car', 'thieves', 'who', 'also', 'kidnap', 'maker', 'funny', 'money.Harry', 'periodically', 'rescued', 'Trench', 'always', 'upper', 'hand', 'lieutenant', 'relationship', 'two', 'always', 'crackerjack']",Harry O: The Complete Second Season

Bought both seasons and the feature length pilot direct from Warner Bros when they first came out. Recalled seeing many of them when they initially aired back in the 70's. The only thing about them that doesn't carry forward well is the early/mid 70's mod clothing that some of the more hip characters in the series wore.
