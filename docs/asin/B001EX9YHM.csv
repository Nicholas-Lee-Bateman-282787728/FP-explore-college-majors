Ratcliffe ""wearevinyl""","[0, 0]","Having caught this show totally by accident on Youtube, all i needed to see was a few scenes of this short-lived show to convince me to buy it here, on Amazon.What is actually more than the first season, it includes season 2, but not the 4 episodes from season 3, which was abandoned after lead character Hylda Baker had injured herself while filming the first episode of season 3.The show was originally supposed to be a spin-off of a previous show that starred Baker (Nearest And Dearest), but changed a few things here and there in the procss to bring certain aspects of the new show a bit of freshness. It never did catch on for some reason, as I find Baker's occasional 'ticks' with the English language funny, but what one would call this show almost like 'Cheers' in a way. As owner of a pub, Baker encounters different personalities that drop by, some are endearing, some are a little annoying, but adds to the charm of this show nonetheless.I rated this show highly for 2 reasons. First, for having this available on Region 1, so those in the USA can enjoy a good classic britcom. Second, for making me laugh, think, and enjoy a good show that didn't rely on raunchy humor.",5,Not On Your Nellie!,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,1182,"['Having', 'caught', 'show', 'totally', 'accident', 'Youtube', 'i', 'needed', 'see', 'was', 'few', 'scenes', 'short-lived', 'show', 'convince', 'buy', 'here', 'Amazon.What', 'actually', 'more', 'first', 'season', 'season', '2', 'not', '4', 'episodes', 'season', '3', 'was', 'abandoned', 'lead', 'character', 'Hylda', 'Baker', 'had', 'injured', 'filming', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '3.The', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'spin-off', 'previous', 'show', 'starred', 'Baker', 'Nearest', 'Dearest', 'changed', 'few', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'procss', 'bring', 'certain', 'aspects', 'new', 'show', 'bit', 'freshness', 'never', 'did', 'catch', 'reason', 'find', 'Baker', 'occasional', ""'ticks"", 'English', 'language', 'funny', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'show', 'almost', ""'Cheers"", 'way', 'owner', 'pub', 'Baker', 'different', 'personalities', 'drop', 'are', 'endearing', 'are', 'little', 'annoying', 'charm', 'show', 'nonetheless.I', 'rated', 'show', 'highly', '2', 'reasons', 'First', 'having', 'available', 'Region', '1', 'so', 'USA', 'can', 'enjoy', 'good', 'classic', 'britcom', 'Second', 'making', 'think', 'enjoy', 'good', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'raunchy', 'humor']",Not on Your Nellie: Season 1
