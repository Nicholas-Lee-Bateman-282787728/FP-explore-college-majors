When I finally began watching, I fell in love with Amy and her friends.  I applaud their courage.

1636900,A1D22OU25XABAK,B00BOTCHRU,Baranabus,"[1, 1]","I'm still in Season 2, but this show has me hooked. I'm binge-watching and wish that it was still on the air. Dern is brilliant, as is Mike White.At first it had me alternately pissed and laughing at the narcissistic, self-righteous Amy who seems opportunistic yet pious. What irked me was the way it seems to follow the stereotype of a whistle-blower as just a crank with an axe to grind, negating the value of dissent (a book on Wikileaks I was reading dismissed Manning this way, as well as Assange- while Assange is probably a creep, the character assassination of Manning seems secondary to the question exposing war crimes).In the beginning, it makes acceptance of corporate corruption seem normal, and only an unhinged, emotional f-up would complain about it, and naively so. And in some ways, there may be truth to that: people with nothing to lose may be more likely to say the unspoken instead of people who have a vested interest in maintaining status quo.But living in the Bay Area, I've seen a lot of Amys- and I'm sure many of us have. People who aren't really that self-sacrificing but just want to guilt-trip you to death. People who don't really want to do the hard work of social justice, but talk about it loudly. My favorite part (spoiler) is where she doesn't want to work with homeless people for low pay, but she's weasley enough to let her boss think **she's** homeless so she can keep the job she keeps slacking on. WOW! Yet I've known Amy's, and I've worked with them.(****some spoilers below****)But there are great shifts in her character, though she's deeply flawed; I love the episode ""Other People's Lives"" where she starts to slowly remove her head from her arse. I think the show is great for showing the especially lame side of New Ageyness in all of its cloying self-righteous cluelessness, yet then it makes us reexamine our own cynicism. Even when you want to smack Amy, she's pretty hard to stop watching.Also, just when it makes you somewhat sympathetic to her, she's confronted with the question of her own motives by the very type of social justice-fighter that she wants to be: a reporter bluntly asks her ""did somebody screw you over?"" which is what we knew from the beginning, that she never would've cared about social justice before until her way of life was pulled out from under her. She would've been just like everybody else in the company, living the good life and not asking too many questions.And the episode ""Consider Helen"" is also quite powerful. I won't give that away though...just stick with it through all the awkwardness and squirmy moments. That's what makes real drama, not lightweight entertainment and cheap laughs.Don't write it off too quickly- there's a lot of substance here. Also, I think Dougie's line ""Stay anal, guys"" needs to be a catchphrase.I think only Laura Dern could've pulled off this character.",5,Stick with it-it's got more depth than you think,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,2876,"[""'m"", 'still', 'Season', '2', 'show', 'hooked', ""'m"", 'binge-watching', 'wish', 'was', 'still', 'air', 'Dern', 'brilliant', 'Mike', 'White.At', 'first', 'had', 'alternately', 'pissed', 'laughing', 'narcissistic', 'self-righteous', 'Amy', 'who', 'opportunistic', 'yet', 'pious', 'What', 'irked', 'was', 'way', 'follow', 'stereotype', 'whistle-blower', 'just', 'crank', 'axe', 'grind', 'negating', 'value', 'dissent', 'book', 'Wikileaks', 'was', 'reading', 'dismissed', 'Manning', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'Assange-', 'Assange', 'probably', 'creep', 'character', 'assassination', 'Manning', 'secondary', 'question', 'exposing', 'war', 'crimes', '.In', 'beginning', 'acceptance', 'corporate', 'corruption', 'seem', 'normal', 'only', 'unhinged', 'emotional', 'f-up', 'would', 'complain', 'naively', 'so', 'ways', 'may', 'be', 'truth', 'people', 'nothing', 'lose', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'say', 'unspoken', 'instead', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'vested', 'interest', 'maintaining', 'status', 'quo.But', 'living', 'Bay', 'Area', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'Amys-', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'have', 'People', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'self-sacrificing', 'just', 'want', 'guilt-trip', 'death', 'People', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'do', 'hard', 'work', 'social', 'justice', 'talk', 'loudly', 'favorite', 'part', 'spoiler', 'where', ""n't"", 'want', 'work', 'homeless', 'people', 'low', 'pay', 'weasley', 'enough', 'let', 'boss', 'think', ""**she's**"", 'homeless', 'can', 'keep', 'job', 'slacking', 'WOW', ""'ve"", 'known', 'Amy', ""'ve"", 'worked', '****some', 'spoilers', 'below****', 'are', 'great', 'shifts', 'character', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'love', 'episode', 'Other', 'People', 'Lives', 'where', 'slowly', 'remove', 'head', 'arse', 'think', 'show', 'great', 'showing', 'especially', 'lame', 'side', 'New', 'Ageyness', 'cloying', 'self-righteous', 'cluelessness', 'yet', 'then', 'reexamine', 'own', 'cynicism', 'Even', 'when', 'want', 'smack', 'Amy', 'pretty', 'hard', 'stop', 'watching.Also', 'just', 'when', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'confronted', 'question', 'own', 'motives', 'very', 'type', 'social', 'justice-fighter', 'be', 'reporter', 'bluntly', 'did', 'somebody', 'screw', 'what', 'knew', 'beginning', 'never', 'would', ""'ve"", 'cared', 'social', 'justice', 'way', 'life', 'was', 'pulled', 'out', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'company', 'living', 'good', 'life', 'not', 'asking', 'too', 'many', 'questions.And', 'episode', 'Consider', 'Helen', 'also', 'quite', 'powerful', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'just', 'stick', 'awkwardness', 'squirmy', 'moments', 'what', 'real', 'drama', 'not', 'lightweight', 'entertainment', 'cheap', 'laughs.Do', ""n't"", 'write', 'off', 'too', 'quickly-', 'lot', 'substance', 'here', 'Also', 'think', 'Dougie', 'line', 'Stay', 'anal', 'guys', 'needs', 'be', 'catchphrase.I', 'think', 'only', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'could', ""'ve"", 'pulled', 'off', 'character']",Enlightened: Season 2

As in all major life changes it is more often messy than smooth or pretty. All the turmoil makes this viewer uncomfortable, yet if it weren't for such committed whistle-blowers, social and industrial change would happen much more slowly and even more painfully. Laura's real life mother, Diane Ladd, is great as Amy's mother. The rest of the talented cast does an admirable job with the series as well.

Enlightened Season Two maps the territory in an erratic, sometimes aimless way that eventually delivers its punch through underplaying (yes, even Laura Dern and her mother try underplaying here, to great result) and some script surprises which I dare not reveal in this public space, eve though the show's been cancelled and anyone who cared for it has doubtless subscribed to HBO and gone for it.  But anyhow when the end times came for Enlightened I put aside my grudges and totally embraced the ethos of the show, confusing and arbitrary as it is/was.I should add that some varied acting helped the pace of Season Two.  Viewers, some of us, had a hard time with Laura Dern's continual swing between relentless optimism and Nazimova-like gloom, which occurred in every episode; one wanted to reach out and counsel her, Amy Jellicoe, don't stop taking your meds just because you saw a flower in your mother's garden.  And Christa, her assistant, obdurately chipper and phony, and Mike White sitting there looking like the underside of a log in every episode, his lips twitching--well, the director made them all act this way  We looked forward to Luke Wilson showing up once in a while not because he's a better actor, nor because he used to be a hunk (sorry, that boat sailed long ago) but because he gave some relief from the one dimensionality of everything else we knew about the world of Enlightened.  Southern California is a two-edged sword in this series, one blade ripe for satire of New Age belief in self-improvement, and the other blade trying to cut through the thorny, perdurate fiber of corporate culture with its lies standing in for truth.  But Season Two brought us Molly Shannon and James Rebhorn as the top players at Abbaddon and the show got much more intriguing instantly.  And also late in the season, we got a blast of Charlie from GIRLS in Hawaii trying out rehab and failing miserably, right before he got fired from GIRLS itself, poor guy.  Yet another victim of corporate culture, meta style?  He was good in this show too.Did they know ahead of time, last year, when Laura Dern was pushed into the bowels of Timm Sharp's Cogentiva, that the humble IT department would be put into use, episode by episode, in a Herculean effort to bring down Abbadon?
