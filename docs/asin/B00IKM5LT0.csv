1694390,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B00IKM5LT0,D. Holmes,"[10, 14]","Blood Ties is a muscular and old-fashioned drama of crime and family.  It is the first English-language film by French actor and director Guillaume Canet, perhaps known best behind the camera for the art-house hit Tell No One.  He shares writing credit here with director James Gray, who has developed a small, but potent cult fan base for his films set in and around Brighton Beach, including We Own the Night and Two Lovers.  For his fans, his authentic, soulful, and urban touch overshadows any repetition in regard to content and location.  This new film bears a strong resemblance to We Own Night:  the focus is once again on brothers, one an honest detective (Billy Crudup) and the other a career criminal (Clive Owen), and their painful bid to understand and forgive one another amidst escalating tension and violence.This is not a hard film for a cynic to criticize, so I am not surprised by the mixed reviews.  Though played by recognizable performers such as Marion Cotillard (the director's wife), Mila Kunis, and Zoe Saldana, none of the female characters are complex, functioning only as girlfriends and wives, betrayers and prostitutes.  For Gray, it could be described as a cinematic greatest-hits record, constructed from characters, confrontations, and themes lifted from his overall oeuvre.  And understatement is not always the film's strong suit:  note how a scene in which one character, a former drug user, relapses is set to none other than ""Heroin"" by the Velvet Underground.  Despite the flaws, however, Blood Ties is still entertaining, overflowing with period-perfect design choices and exciting heist and chase sequences.  And as the brothers, both stars are riveting; they give the domestic dysfunction depth and grit, ensuring the audience invests in their shared fate.  Owen in particular shines as a man who motions at times toward nobility and redemption, but always finds himself turning again to murder and theft out of desperation and self-hatred.",4,"Unoriginal, but very entertaining and well-acted",1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,1983,"['Blood', 'Ties', 'muscular', 'old-fashioned', 'drama', 'crime', 'family', 'first', 'English-language', 'film', 'French', 'actor', 'director', 'Guillaume', 'Canet', 'perhaps', 'known', 'best', 'camera', 'art-house', 'hit', 'Tell', 'No', 'One', 'shares', 'writing', 'credit', 'here', 'director', 'James', 'Gray', 'who', 'developed', 'small', 'potent', 'cult', 'fan', 'base', 'films', 'set', 'Brighton', 'Beach', 'including', 'Own', 'Night', 'Two', 'Lovers', 'fans', 'authentic', 'soulful', 'urban', 'touch', 'repetition', 'regard', 'content', 'location', 'new', 'film', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Own', 'Night', 'focus', 'once', 'again', 'brothers', 'one', 'honest', 'detective', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'other', 'career', 'criminal', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'painful', 'bid', 'understand', 'forgive', 'one', 'amidst', 'escalating', 'tension', 'violence.This', 'not', 'hard', 'film', 'cynic', 'criticize', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'played', 'recognizable', 'performers', 'such', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'director', 'wife', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'none', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'functioning', 'only', 'girlfriends', 'wives', 'betrayers', 'prostitutes', 'Gray', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'cinematic', 'greatest-hits', 'record', 'constructed', 'characters', 'confrontations', 'themes', 'lifted', 'overall', 'oeuvre', 'understatement', 'not', 'always', 'film', 'strong', 'suit', 'note', 'how', 'scene', 'one', 'character', 'former', 'drug', 'user', 'relapses', 'set', 'none', 'other', 'Heroin', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'flaws', 'however', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'still', 'entertaining', 'overflowing', 'period-perfect', 'design', 'choices', 'exciting', 'heist', 'chase', 'sequences', 'brothers', 'stars', 'are', 'riveting', 'give', 'domestic', 'dysfunction', 'depth', 'grit', 'ensuring', 'audience', 'invests', 'shared', 'fate', 'Owen', 'particular', 'shines', 'man', 'who', 'times', 'nobility', 'redemption', 'always', 'turning', 'again', 'murder', 'theft', 'desperation', 'self-hatred']",Blood Ties

1694401,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00IKM5LT0,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","In BLOOD TIES the setting is New York, the time is 1974 and the problems faced by one family are more than they can surmount before the final credits role in this film. The story looks at one family that has many dysfunctional problems yet somehow bonds before the end of the film.Billy Cruddup stars as Frank, a NYPD detective on the rise with more than one problem. His first revolves around his ex Vanessa (Zoe Saldana), a woman he gave up to their difference in race. Now married to a small time crook claiming to be straight, Frank still wants to be with her. Was it enough for him to send her husband to jail? That's a question never quite answered. His other more major concern is his brother Chris (Clive Owen). At one time close the two have drifted apart as Chris became more enmeshed in the criminal world, the opposite of his brother.As the film opens Chris is being released from prison on a furlough program. While sister Marie (Lili Taylor) is glad to see him, Frank is a bit more hesitant. Chris has decided to be as straight as possible but between seeing his old friends and having problems at the day to day job he chose you know it won't be what he wants. Old habits are hard to break and eventually Chris is bound to return to his criminal escapades.All of this doesn't bode well for Frank. With Chris living under his roof the rest of the NYPD doesn't look kindly on the situation. For Frank's family, in particular his ailing father (James Caan), their only hope is for Chris to do well. Unfortunately they also tend to turn a blind eye to anything that Chris might be involved in that isn't on the up and up.Chris slowly gets back into his old ways. After a failed attempt at starting a new business, he gets involved with a crew of robbers. He visits his children and their mother Monica (Marion Cotillard), an ex-junkie who peddles her body on the street to support her and the kids. He meets a new flame where he works (Mila Kunis) and using the money he made robbing an armored car he marries and tries to set up a business, even if it is a whorehouse with his ex in charge.For Frank things aren't going as well. Having Chris as his brother puts him on a bad path in the department. Getting back involved with Vanessa results in little more than her ex bringing violence into their lives or at least the threat of it. These two items combine to make the story of Frank one of family, both his blood relations and the family he chooses. The decisions Frank makes will affect both. Whether this is for the better or not isn't seen until the final scene of the film.The movie captures the feel of New York 1974 with ease, never going for the most obvious depictions we normally get like Studio 54, instead offering us the small time clubs where low level criminals would hang out. In so doing they appear to be big time but in small locales. The costumer involved in this film deserves extra note, capturing the clothing of the ear without going overboard as well. That's the one thing that stands out when capturing the time line here. Not one piece goes over the top and yet it feels like not only the era the film takes place in but the movie has the look of films from that time.There isn't a false note in any of the performances here. Cruddup does a great job portraying Frank as a man who wants to do the right thing and yet finds himself at odds because the one person he may have to place under arrest is his older brother. Owen does a great job as well making Chris a character who is willing to do bad things and yet tries to do the right thing at the same time. There is no way this can work and it's just a matter of time until things explode.The movie never opened big, at least in this area, and from what I recall opened day and date on On Demand when it was released.

Their entire lives they have been different and even though they have grown up some things never change. When Chris tries to get his life back together he finds slipping into his previous routines much easier.  Once again the brothers are on opposite sides of the law. This is a hard movie to review and talk about. The movie is very good and worth seeing but it is also a little slow moving in some parts. This has shades of We Own The Night but it&#8217;s not as exciting as that one. I don&#8217;t know if it was the acting or the writing but Chris was much more interesting and easier to root for even though he was the &#8220;bad one&#8221;.  Even though it was a little predictable that didn&#8217;t take away from the movie at all. There have been many movies with a similar idea that have come out lately but to me none of them have really distanced themselves as being better than the others. While this was a good movie it was nothing amazing, I&#8217;m glad I watched it but I wouldn&#8217;t watch it again.
