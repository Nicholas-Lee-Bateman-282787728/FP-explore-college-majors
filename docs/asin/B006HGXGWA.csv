It's Dumb & Dumber & The MASK all in one how can you beat that to make it better on Blu-ray now out of all things this (Double Feature Rocks). The only down fall I disliked is I purchased it for $11.00 & something and before I got this Blu-ray in the mail I'm not sure if it was even shipped yet the Price to $9.99 dropped & I still paid the 11 something which sucks but with the other products I did buy went up in Price so I suppose it evened it out either way can't get the ones that only drop and not expect it to change if it goes up so i guess theres a + somewhere lol. I would recommend this product to anyone who LOVES JIM CARREY MOVIES!

It really launched Carrey at the time, which later allowed him to command mega bucks on future films, but from beginning to end the comedy is timeless, the effects were cartoonish enough where you didn't judge them compared to today's abilities. Cameron is perfect. The extras were really good as well.Dumb and Dumber just falls flat for me.

1515509,AA7P2NEC94K79,B006HGXGWA,J. Pappan,"[3, 3]","I already own both of these movies in DVD format, so, I bought this for a few reasons.- I was hoping the picture quality would be improved. Even a slight difference is enough to justify the cost for these two classics.- The TrueHD audio tracks which this offers provides lossless audio for an improved home theater experience.- &#34;Dumb and Dumber&#34; Unrated features some snippets not included in the Theatrical (DVD) release. I wanted to see what was removed.I'm glad I went with this set. The picture quality is slightly improved on &#34;Dumb and Dumber&#34;, and significantly improved on &#34;The Mask&#34;. See my images in the item description for the top/bottom comparison of DVD vs. Blu-ray.This set offers TrueHD for both titles, which is a lossless audio track which is superior to AC3 audio (codec used for DVD audio). I could hear a better center channel in comparison. The difference is slight.The &#34;Dumb and Dumber&#34; Unrated had some scenes included which were removed in the Theatrical release - for a reason. You'll find the &#34;additions&#34; (or subtractions, rather) are not terribly funny. It's interesting nonetheless. It kind of livens up an old film when you see a few new snippets.Overall a great purchase if you want these in your collection of classics.",5,"Improved sound and picture quality, great bargain for two classics",1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,1290,"['already', 'own', 'movies', 'DVD', 'format', 'bought', 'few', 'reasons.-', 'was', 'hoping', 'picture', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'improved', 'Even', 'slight', 'difference', 'enough', 'justify', 'cost', 'two', 'classics.-', 'TrueHD', 'audio', 'tracks', 'lossless', 'audio', 'improved', 'home', 'theater', 'experience.-', '34', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', '34', 'Unrated', 'snippets', 'not', 'included', 'Theatrical', 'DVD', 'release', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'removed.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'went', 'set', 'picture', 'quality', 'slightly', 'improved', '34', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', '34', 'significantly', 'improved', '34', 'Mask', '34', 'See', 'images', 'item', 'description', 'top/bottom', 'comparison', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray.This', 'set', 'offers', 'TrueHD', 'titles', 'lossless', 'audio', 'track', 'superior', 'AC3', 'audio', 'codec', 'used', 'DVD', 'audio', 'could', 'hear', 'better', 'center', 'channel', 'comparison', 'difference', 'slight.The', '34', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', '34', 'Unrated', 'had', 'scenes', 'included', 'were', 'removed', 'Theatrical', 'release', 'reason', ""'ll"", 'find', '34', 'additions', '34', 'subtractions', 'rather', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'funny', 'interesting', 'nonetheless', 'kind', 'livens', 'old', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'few', 'new', 'snippets.Overall', 'great', 'purchase', 'want', 'collection', 'classics']",Dumb & Dumber: Unrated / The Mask
