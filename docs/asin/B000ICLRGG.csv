It was the same old plot that we have seen over and over and over but done in a completely different way. Another good movie to veg out and enjoy the season. I heard someone on TV just yesterday say that Tom Arnold without Rosie was enough to turn them off from watching anything. I think it's just the opposite; I wouldn't watch Rosie but he's not so bad away from her. I was surprised at the Christmas movie I saw him in, two years ago, I think. He wasn't bad and he still isn't. He's not afraid to laugh at himself and we liked this new twist of the plot and the actors. You would never expect Christmas past to be as he was in this movie but we've watched this one twice and will probably watch it again before the season is over.",5,Just enjoy it,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,773,"['one', 'was', 'surprising', 'movie', 'was', 'same', 'old', 'plot', 'have', 'seen', 'done', 'completely', 'different', 'way', 'good', 'movie', 'veg', 'out', 'enjoy', 'season', 'heard', 'someone', 'TV', 'just', 'yesterday', 'say', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'Rosie', 'was', 'enough', 'turn', 'off', 'watching', 'anything', 'think', 'just', 'opposite', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Rosie', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'away', 'was', 'surprised', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'saw', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'still', ""n't"", 'not', 'afraid', 'laugh', 'liked', 'new', 'twist', 'plot', 'actors', 'would', 'never', 'expect', 'Christmas', 'be', 'was', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'one', 'twice', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'season', 'over']",Chasing Christmas

Tom Arnold hates Christmas because his ex-wife cheated on him with his dentist on Christmas Eve. When he finally becomes enlightened by things he has no control over with the visits of Christmas spirits, it begins to sink into his head that he doesn't have it so bad.

This time the ghost of Christmas past doesnt cooperate so the story takes a different and mostly includes the ghost of Christmas present. The ghost of Christmas future doesnt show up until the end.

In ""Chasing Christmas"" the ""scrooge"" character is about as unlikeable as any I've seen, because this one is the dad of a beautiful teenage girl who longs for a normal Christmas. Her dad, who is embittered about Christmas because he caught his wife cheating on him on a Christmas Eve 7 years ago, hates everything about Christmas. Of course there are the usual Ghosts of Christmas, but in a unique twist, the Ghost of Christmas Past is also embittered at the world he sees now, and wishes to live in the past himself.
