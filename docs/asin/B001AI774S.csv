The production values, writing and amazing cast manage to mesmerize, thought provoke and terrify with tales that are very unique and intelligent.The cast led by the amazing Patricia Arquette expands this year and only for the better.  The story line since season one plays like a continuous movie.  There are stories each week but underneath is a continuous story that evolves and grabs the viewer.Patricia Arquette is the ultimate example of how great it is when a film actress brings their talents to tv.  She carries this show totally on her shoulder and her performance is so real and complex one can't help but watch with amazement.Most shows on network tv are formulaic and predictable.  Hospital shows that are more about romance are a dime a dozen.  This show in a very realistic way shows a very believable family and all they go through as well as the professions of the characters with the sasme realism.It really bothers me when people give a low review based on Amazon and their performance or the writers strike affecting the # of episodes or even the price.  Reviews here should be based soley on the dvd set of medium - Season 4 and that rates a definite 5 stars.  I can't wait for September and Season 5.",5,BEST SHOW ON NETWORK TELEVISION,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,1261,"['Medium', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'production', 'values', 'writing', 'amazing', 'cast', 'manage', 'mesmerize', 'thought', 'provoke', 'terrify', 'tales', 'are', 'very', 'unique', 'intelligent.The', 'cast', 'led', 'amazing', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'year', 'only', 'better', 'story', 'line', 'season', 'one', 'continuous', 'movie', 'are', 'stories', 'week', 'underneath', 'continuous', 'story', 'grabs', 'viewer.Patricia', 'Arquette', 'ultimate', 'example', 'how', 'great', 'when', 'film', 'actress', 'talents', 'tv', 'show', 'totally', 'shoulder', 'performance', 'so', 'real', 'complex', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'amazement.Most', 'shows', 'network', 'tv', 'are', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'Hospital', 'shows', 'are', 'more', 'romance', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'show', 'very', 'realistic', 'way', 'very', 'believable', 'family', 'go', 'as', 'well', 'professions', 'characters', 'sasme', 'realism.It', 'really', 'bothers', 'when', 'people', 'give', 'low', 'review', 'based', 'Amazon', 'performance', 'writers', 'strike', 'affecting', 'episodes', 'even', 'price', 'Reviews', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'based', 'soley', 'dvd', 'set', 'medium', 'Season', '4', 'rates', 'definite', '5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'September', 'Season', '5']",Medium: Season 4

1165751,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B001AI774S,Joanna Mechlinski,"[2, 2]","Allison Dubois (Patricia Arquette) is a thirtysomething woman like countless others. She's a wife and a mother to three adorable young girls, Ariel, Bridgette and Marie. Yet Allison struggles with something that sets her apart -- the ability to dream about crimes, communicate with the dead, read minds and other physic abilities. Wanting to use her gift to help others, Allison works with the Phoenix district attorney, Manuel Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) and detective Lee Scanlon (David Cubitt) to try to help solve area crimes -- sometimes after the fact, and other times, before they actually happen.Unfortunately, Allison's dreams -- more accurately called nightmares -- are often horrifically graphic, and usually not very clear. So, she must relive them, night after night, hoping to gain new details and understanding with each new version.Allison's daughters -- especially teenage Ariel -- also possess psychic talents of their own, which often troubles their father Joe (Jake Weber). Luckily Joe is basically a laidback type of man, who has come to grips with the fact that he shares his life with four very special women.At the start of the fourth season, Allison's abilities have been made public, and there's something of an outcry from many, who don't like the idea of such a person working with their local police and legal system. Meanwhile Joe is attempting to strike out on his own after being let go from Aerodytech following the previous season's hostage situation.Notable Season 4 episodes include ""But for the Grace of God,"" where Allison works with Det. Cynthia Keener (guest star Anjelica Houston) while Ariel begins dreaming about her mother's own teenage years, and the two-part ""Wicked Game,"" where Allison and Cynthia attempt to solve the mystery of Cynthia's own daughter's murder and keep the killer from striking again.Other notable guest stars include Kelly Preston as Megan Doyle, a new business partner of Joe's who may have her own agenda in mind, and Kelsey Grammar as FBI Agent Edward Cooper.All in all, ""Medium"" is a great show -- it's a perfect mix of fascinating mysteries and crimes, while balancing the very human Dubois family and all its day-to-day issues.",4,"Ordinary woman, struggling with extraordinary abilities...",1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,2198,"['Allison', 'Dubois', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'thirtysomething', 'woman', 'countless', 'others', 'wife', 'mother', 'three', 'adorable', 'young', 'girls', 'Ariel', 'Bridgette', 'Marie', 'Allison', 'something', 'apart', 'ability', 'dream', 'crimes', 'communicate', 'dead', 'read', 'minds', 'other', 'physic', 'abilities', 'Wanting', 'use', 'gift', 'help', 'others', 'Allison', 'Phoenix', 'district', 'attorney', 'Manuel', 'Devalos', 'Miguel', 'Sandoval', 'detective', 'Lee', 'Scanlon', 'David', 'Cubitt', 'try', 'help', 'solve', 'area', 'crimes', 'sometimes', 'fact', 'other', 'times', 'actually', 'happen.Unfortunately', 'Allison', 'dreams', 'more', 'accurately', 'called', 'nightmares', 'are', 'often', 'horrifically', 'graphic', 'usually', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'So', 'must', 'relive', 'night', 'night', 'hoping', 'gain', 'new', 'details', 'understanding', 'new', 'version.Allison', 'daughters', 'especially', 'teenage', 'Ariel', 'also', 'possess', 'psychic', 'talents', 'own', 'often', 'father', 'Joe', 'Jake', 'Weber', 'Luckily', 'Joe', 'basically', 'laidback', 'type', 'man', 'who', 'come', 'grips', 'fact', 'shares', 'life', 'four', 'very', 'special', 'women.At', 'start', 'fourth', 'season', 'Allison', 'abilities', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'public', 'something', 'outcry', 'many', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'such', 'person', 'working', 'local', 'police', 'legal', 'system', 'Meanwhile', 'Joe', 'attempting', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'being', 'let', 'go', 'Aerodytech', 'following', 'previous', 'season', 'hostage', 'situation.Notable', 'Season', '4', 'episodes', 'include', 'Grace', 'God', 'where', 'Allison', 'Det', 'Cynthia', 'Keener', 'guest', 'star', 'Anjelica', 'Houston', 'Ariel', 'dreaming', 'mother', 'own', 'teenage', 'years', 'two-part', 'Wicked', 'Game', 'where', 'Allison', 'Cynthia', 'attempt', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Cynthia', 'own', 'daughter', 'murder', 'keep', 'killer', 'striking', 'again.Other', 'notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'include', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Megan', 'Doyle', 'new', 'business', 'partner', 'Joe', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'own', 'agenda', 'mind', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Edward', 'Cooper.All', 'Medium', 'great', 'show', 'perfect', 'mix', 'fascinating', 'mysteries', 'crimes', 'balancing', 'very', 'human', 'Dubois', 'family', 'day-to-day', 'issues']",Medium: Season 4

1165755,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B001AI774S,Lee Armstrong,"[9, 9]","I'm so glad to have the fourth season of ""Medium"" on DVD.  This has been my favorite show on TV for 4 years now.  While I tried to watch each episode, I never saw ""Car Trouble"" during broadcast; so as Allison tried to catch a Hispanic killer, only to find he is a model who was on a poster completely engaged me.  ""Lady Killer"" with Patricia Arquette's sister Rosanna Arquette starring as an author who writes a best seller about how older women can get guys turns into an exciting tracking of a serial killer.  ""Drowned World"" that traces a story of a family's dysfunction as it is manifested into dreams of running water built with great unexpected turns.  What Glenn Gordon Caron calls ""story arcs,"" stories that span a number of episodes, brings Angelica Huston as Cynthia Keener, the representative of an organization Ameritips that try to find lost children.  Huston's character builds until her final climactic episodes of ""Wicked Games.""  The season had a tremendous setup from the previous season as both Joe Dubois and Allison find themselves out of work.  Their struggle with family bills, trying to find ways to say no to the children who want money for special things, and having to ask for help from Joe's mother all give this show the duality of the fantastic element of the paranormal and the everyday life of an American family trying to make ends meet.  Joe & Allison's love for each other shines well, particularly in the episodes where Allison gets jealous of Kelly Preston's character who plays Joe's boss on several episodes.  The packaging on the box is excellent.  I particularly appreciate watching the shows without commercial breaks.  While shorter than previous seasons, Season 4 is a welcome addition that will come out from time to time for return engagements on my DVD.
