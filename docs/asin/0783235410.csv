Of course it's so confusing knowing which one is which that I honestly had more trouble just following along to the plot than anything else.In addition to that, the woman who plays lead characters spends WAY too much time screaming her head off and never acting normal even for a *second* so the entire film ended up giving me a headache.I understand she'd freak out during one scene involving her daughter by a lake, but for the most part, she was extremely hard to deal with thanks entirely to her nonstop screaming.  It was completely out of control to an annoying extent.Sometimes I just don't get what the writers are going for, and this *extremely* confusing storyline is a perfect example of ""I don't get it"" that I've ever seen.  You just don't know what's going on half the time... no no, make that 25% of the time.

Annette Bening (American Beauty) is Claire, a woman who has become psychically linked w/ a serial murderer named Vivian Thompson, played by Robert Downey, jr. (Zodiac). The two are drawn together in fatalistic fashion, while Claire's mind disintegrates, and her family is obliterated. Sound like fun? I first saw this gruesome little chiller back in '99.

65759,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,0783235410,California Dreaming,"[1, 2]","In 1999, there was this guy who went completely off the rails.  He was a squatter, did drugs, and was a nightmare for everyone around him.  It's amazing how art can imitate life.Well, luckily for us, Robert Downey Jr. turned his life around, while not so much can be said about the character named Vivian that he played in this film.  Vivian is surely a psycho, but the question is, how could any sane real-life actor want to play this character after taking a peek at the screenplay?  Or even want to be involved in such an ill-fated project?And this goes for Annette Bening, who's done some very nice work over her career.  It even applies to Aidan Quinn, an actor that I believe hasn't quite gotten enough credit over the years.  I think that, while you surely can't bucket him into that ""great"" actor category, he surely is only a notch or so below that.  He was really good in ""Stakeout,"" but I also really liked him in ""Benny and Joon.""  And he's kind of got that ""everyman quality"" that people can relate to, even though most likely most women find him to be attractive.With regards to this film, the screenplay is absolutely nonsensical.  I was laughing most of the time, which surely is a bad sign.  This was supposed to be either horror, or some psychological thriller, right?  Well, it was horrifying, call it more of a nightmare that never seemed to end.  And it's running time was only 98 minutes, but it sure seemed much longer than that to me.  After I had wasted a half hour or so of my time, I decided to stick it out.  Well, as a smart guy once said to me, ""Don't throw good money after bad.""  Wish I'd listen, even though this was on ""free"" TV.Thinking about the question, ""Why did the actors even want to be involved in this ill-fated project?"" I did come up with a theory.  It was 1999 and a recession was just on the horizon.  The DotCom bubble was about to burst, and money was going to be tight.  Well, both the Robert Downey Jr. and Annette Bening characters were supposed to be psychic, so maybe they realized in advance that they'd need the work and the money.

65764,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0783235410,D. Litton,"[8, 10]","Perhaps one of the most evocative thrillers ever created for film, &quot;In Dreams&quot; is one of the most visually and psychologically stunning films that has ever come to the silver screen. It isn't very often that I can say this about a film and mean every word of it; even the best of movies have their flaws. Personally, I found this one to be quite flawless. The story and actors work together in every way possible to make the movie flow at a steady pace, and in the end, everything that is supposed to make sense does.Annette Bening is Claire Cooper, wife of an airline pilot, mother of a little girl, and illustrator of childrens books. The family lives in a town that sits near a reservoir, which covers a ghost town that was abandoned in order for the reservoir to be built. Claire is beginning to have strange dreams as soon as the film begins, one being a little girl who is led into an orchard-like place full of apples by a long-haired individual. Soon after, her daughter is abducted from a school play, causing Claire to realize that the dreams she is having are visions of the future, believing that the killer is channeling them into her mind in order for her to find him. After they find the body of her daughter, Claire runs her car off the dam, ultimately surviving the fall and going into a coma for six months. During this period, she has visions of an orchard filled with apples, nursery rhymes written in blood on a wall, and a small boy tied to a bed in a room slowly filling with water. Going home from the hospital proves to be a bad decision, and after much mayhem, she is put into a mental institution, where she begins having dreams about the death of her husband. As the dreams keep coming, people keep thinking that she is crazy, until she finally escapes to find herself face-to-face with the killer himself, who has a dangerous surprise for her.Little can be said to denounce the film; it simply is that good. What really keeps it moving are the macabre images of decay and death the pervade throughout the entire movie, keeping in touch with the sinister environment that is necessary for the movie's story. The images of the haunting dreams are the most significant, and these scenes are shot with poor color clarity and slightly soft-edged images to complete the sense of surrealism. The underwater photography used in filming the reservoir sequences is stupendous, and quite frightening as well. Moviegoers expect to see a sunken ship or marine vessel underneath the surface of water, but to see a town completely covered with water is a whole new ball game, a game that seems to have won. There is not an over-abundance of blood or gore in the film; scenes include a second-long shot of a dog eating a corpse, a man wearing sunglasses being stabbed in the eye, and a woman with slit wrists that hardly bleed.The story is based on the novel &quot;Doll's Eyes,&quot; written by Bari Wood, and screenwriters Bruce Robinson and Neil Jordan, who also directed the piece, have done a masterful job in bringing to the story a sense of overwhelming suspense and uncertainty. The truly magnificent aspect of the story is that everything that happens in the beginning and middle will all be tied back together in the end, making for a very satisfying and involving thriller.The performances by the actors also make the movie enjoyable. This is, without a doubt, the best of Annette Bening's films, encompassing even her performance in American Beauty. This is clearly her movie, as she will be the centrifuge for all that goes on throughout the entire experience. Robert Downey, Jr. is a perfect psychotic, his long, dirty hair and sensational eyes pierce right into the subconscious of those who see him act in this movie, the element that creates the upset in Claire's life. Aidan Quinn is a convincing husband, though I did not particularly care for the way in which the character of the husband is portrayed; he could've been a little more sensitive to his wife's feelings. Stephen Rea plays the doctor who refuses to give up on Claire, and he does a good job in carrying us with him in his quest for the truth, even if that quest picks up later than is needed.Under the glorious direction of Neil Jordan, &quot;In Dreams&quot; is a perfect and almost sparkling example of terrific thriller-making. It may well be said that this is the best movie I have ever seen in a long time, simply for the fact that it is solid entertainment that never stops moving, even if its audiences cannot keep up.",5,"Haunting, moving, emotional, and totally involving!",977270400,"12 20, 2000",2000,4529,"['Perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'evocative', 'thrillers', 'ever', 'created', 'film', 'quot', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'psychologically', 'stunning', 'films', 'ever', 'come', 'silver', 'screen', ""n't"", 'very', 'often', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'mean', 'word', 'even', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'flaws', 'Personally', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'quite', 'flawless', 'story', 'actors', 'work', 'together', 'way', 'possible', 'make', 'movie', 'flow', 'steady', 'pace', 'end', 'everything', 'supposed', 'make', 'sense', 'does.Annette', 'Bening', 'Claire', 'Cooper', 'wife', 'airline', 'pilot', 'mother', 'little', 'girl', 'illustrator', 'childrens', 'books', 'family', 'town', 'reservoir', 'ghost', 'town', 'was', 'abandoned', 'order', 'reservoir', 'be', 'built', 'Claire', 'beginning', 'have', 'strange', 'dreams', 'as', 'soon', 'film', 'one', 'being', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'led', 'orchard-like', 'place', 'full', 'apples', 'long-haired', 'individual', 'Soon', 'daughter', 'abducted', 'school', 'play', 'causing', 'Claire', 'realize', 'dreams', 'having', 'are', 'visions', 'future', 'believing', 'killer', 'channeling', 'mind', 'order', 'find', 'find', 'body', 'daughter', 'Claire', 'car', 'dam', 'ultimately', 'surviving', 'fall', 'going', 'coma', 'six', 'months', 'period', 'visions', 'orchard', 'filled', 'apples', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'written', 'blood', 'wall', 'small', 'boy', 'tied', 'bed', 'room', 'slowly', 'filling', 'water', 'Going', 'home', 'hospital', 'be', 'bad', 'decision', 'much', 'mayhem', 'put', 'mental', 'institution', 'where', 'having', 'dreams', 'death', 'husband', 'dreams', 'keep', 'coming', 'people', 'keep', 'thinking', 'crazy', 'finally', 'find', 'herself', 'face-to-face', 'killer', 'who', 'dangerous', 'surprise', 'her.Little', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'denounce', 'film', 'simply', 'good', 'What', 'really', 'moving', 'are', 'macabre', 'images', 'decay', 'death', 'pervade', 'entire', 'movie', 'keeping', 'touch', 'sinister', 'environment', 'necessary', 'movie', 'story', 'images', 'haunting', 'dreams', 'are', 'most', 'significant', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'poor', 'color', 'clarity', 'slightly', 'soft-edged', 'images', 'complete', 'sense', 'surrealism', 'underwater', 'photography', 'used', 'filming', 'reservoir', 'sequences', 'stupendous', 'quite', 'frightening', 'as', 'well', 'Moviegoers', 'expect', 'see', 'sunken', 'ship', 'marine', 'vessel', 'surface', 'water', 'see', 'town', 'completely', 'covered', 'water', 'whole', 'new', 'ball', 'game', 'game', 'have', 'won', 'not', 'over-abundance', 'blood', 'gore', 'film', 'scenes', 'include', 'second-long', 'shot', 'dog', 'eating', 'corpse', 'man', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'being', 'stabbed', 'eye', 'woman', 'slit', 'wrists', 'hardly', 'bleed.The', 'story', 'based', 'novel', 'quot', 'Doll', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'written', 'Bari', 'Wood', 'screenwriters', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'piece', 'have', 'done', 'masterful', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'sense', 'overwhelming', 'suspense', 'uncertainty', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'aspect', 'story', 'everything', 'beginning', 'middle', 'will', 'be', 'tied', 'back', 'together', 'end', 'making', 'very', 'satisfying', 'involving', 'thriller.The', 'performances', 'actors', 'also', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'doubt', 'best', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'films', 'encompassing', 'even', 'performance', 'American', 'Beauty', 'clearly', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'centrifuge', 'entire', 'experience', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'perfect', 'psychotic', 'long', 'dirty', 'hair', 'sensational', 'eyes', 'pierce', 'right', 'subconscious', 'who', 'see', 'act', 'movie', 'element', 'upset', 'Claire', 'life', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'convincing', 'husband', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'care', 'way', 'character', 'husband', 'portrayed', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'more', 'sensitive', 'wife', 'feelings', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'doctor', 'who', 'give', 'up', 'Claire', 'good', 'job', 'carrying', 'quest', 'truth', 'even', 'quest', 'up', 'later', 'needed.Under', 'glorious', 'direction', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'quot', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'perfect', 'almost', 'sparkling', 'example', 'terrific', 'thriller-making', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'said', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'simply', 'fact', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'never', 'moving', 'even', 'audiences', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'up']",In Dreams

Benning was not convincing in her role however she definitely had moments. RDJ was as strange as possible in a role that was scripted one half psycho and one half psycho on steroids.

It's typical of the movies they show on LMN.The basic idea is pretty good.  Someone who can invade another person's mind and control their dreams.  But the invader can not only control Claire's dreams but also show her the past and the future.The invader is someone who escaped from a mental institution.  Claire ends up in the same hospital and then eventually relives exactly what that guy did 25 years earlier.This was all caused by that bad guy so he could eventually meet up with Claire and start a new family since his original family life wasn't that great.I guess how much you will enjoy this movie depends on how much you are willing to let your imagination run wild and ignore the utter impossibility that something like this could ever happen.  Since we know it could never happen the only thing left to enjoy is the story and the acting.The movie has an atmosphere of dreariness and despair.  It seems like the weather is overcast every day.

Michael Click,"[1, 8]","Movie: *1/2  DVD Quality: ****  DVD Extras: ***Don't be fooled by the pedigrees of the distinguished cast and crew members; ""In Dreams"" is without doubt THE career low for director/screenwriter Neil Jordan as well as actors Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, and even Robert Downey, Jr. (who's made a handful of turkeys throughout his rollercoaster career).  The film aspires to be a psychological mystery-suspense-thriller in the vein of ""Psycho"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but is completely undone by a cut-and-paste script filled with unlikeable and unbelievable characters; uninspired direction; shallow performances; choppy editing; and a grossly ineffective musical score.  Only one scene in the movie is played convincingly, and that's the one in which Annette Bening finally begins to go over the edge mentally; pitching her voice in a lower tone and undergoing swift changes of emotion, Bening gives a brief and tantalizing glimpse of what she might have been able to achieve with a similar character in a better movie.  Unfortunately, that one scene does not make the chore of sitting through the other 97 minutes of pretention and tedium worthwhile.In terms of technical quality, the DVD presentation of this bomb is more than acceptable.  Picture quality is clear and sharp; the sound is a bit fuzzy in one or two spots, but that may have been the intent of the filmmakers - I was so bored and so eager for the movie to be over that I didn't stop to replay the bits of dialogue in question.  The DVD extras are so-so: thumbnail cast and crew Biographies that mention much better movies; several lackluster screens filled with ""Production Notes""; and finally, the Theatrical Trailer, which is probably the best thing on the disc because it's short and features quick flashes of the film's visual highlights.

This has to be another case where a lot went wrong between a promising script and the finished product. The renowned producer Robert Evans once remarked that the biggest problem with movies today is that too many are made by a committee, rather than by individuals. Perhaps that is the problem here.Annette Bening plays Claire Cooper, who lives in an ordinary town, but who has an extraordinary gift. She is psychic. This is not something she wants in her life, but she is unable to escape it. She has recurrent nightmares about a young boy who, tied to his bed, tries frantically to escape when water begins to fill his room. At the same time, a series of murders begins to occur in the town. She knows her dream is somehow related to them.There are the usual elements of such fare. No one believes her. Her husband is convinced that it's really mental illness. The audience is given enough clues to know that she isn't a fake. There are scenes that make us jump. At times the tension builds, especially in the eerie underwater sequences.Several great movies, such as Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, have been made from premises as absurd as this. After all, the best pictures cause us to get so caught up in them that we temporarily lay aside reason and logic. In Dreams tries hard, but it's rarely able to do that.I think the main problem is that, unlike the movies I mentioned, there is not a whole lot to make us care that much about Claire. It isn't the acting. Bening is professional and convincing, as is Robert Downey, Jr. as the strange Vivian Thompson. Scenes which would bond us to her emotionally are absent. It is always convenient to blame the director. Respected director Neil Jordon certainly hit a career low point here. In this case, I think he didn't have enough to work with. Like a chef, a director can't whip up something delectable if he hasn't the right ingredients.In Dreams makes a decent ""popcorn"" movie. It is simply not up to the standards of the people who worked on it. All of them will recover and go on to bigger things.

Annette is simply stunning in this Neil Jordan thriller that got lost in 1998 and did not receive the acclaim it should have.&quot;In Dreams,&quot; based on the book &quot;Doll's Eyes&quot; by Bari Wood, is a haunting, and sometime disturbing, film.  Annette plays a woman who has been haunted by strange dreams all of her life, sharing the life of a serial killer, played quite convincingly by Robert Downey, Jr.  Aidan Quinn plays her husband, and in a delightful but short role, Pamela Payton-Wright shines as Benning's sanitorium roommate, Ethel.The film abounds in delicious imagery, focusing on apples and Snow White.  The terror mounts subtly, and is quite chilling.  When Annette learns the fate of her daughter, Rebecca, she gives one of the most effective expressions of grief captured on film.  Later, when she is being questioned by psychiatrist Stephen Rea, she blows you away with her attempt to be in control, when she obviously is not.  A totally stunning tour de force for Annette.Her performance alone makes this a five-star movie, although I would have appreciated a more detailed explanation for why her character shares this psychic link with Downey.  Also, her relationship with her husband is not totally fleshed out.  And how did Downey's character survive living in an abandoned orchard?  Those questions' resolutions would have made this an absolutely perfect five stars.  But, nonetheless, &quot;In Dreams&quot; is the kind of thriller that stays with you even after the credits have finished.Also, kudos to Jordan for his use of songs in the movie.  &quot;If,&quot; &quot;Ebb Tide,&quot; &quot;Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree,&quot; and Roy Orbison's title theme, are haunting and sure beats the rock crap we have to put up with most of today's movies.Watch this and enjoy a really different thriller!",5,Not Such Sweet Dreams,973987200,"11 12, 2000",2000,1939,"['Add', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'long', 'list', 'performances', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'nominated', 'let', 'alone', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Annette', 'simply', 'stunning', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'thriller', 'got', 'lost', '1998', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'acclaim', 'should', 'have.', 'quot', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'based', 'book', 'quot', 'Doll', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'Bari', 'Wood', 'haunting', 'sometime', 'disturbing', 'film', 'Annette', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'haunted', 'strange', 'dreams', 'life', 'sharing', 'life', 'serial', 'killer', 'played', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'husband', 'delightful', 'short', 'role', 'Pamela', 'Payton-Wright', 'shines', 'Benning', 'sanitorium', 'roommate', 'Ethel.The', 'film', 'abounds', 'delicious', 'imagery', 'focusing', 'apples', 'Snow', 'White', 'terror', 'mounts', 'subtly', 'quite', 'chilling', 'When', 'Annette', 'fate', 'daughter', 'Rebecca', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'expressions', 'grief', 'captured', 'film', 'Later', 'when', 'being', 'questioned', 'psychiatrist', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'away', 'attempt', 'be', 'control', 'when', 'obviously', 'not', 'A', 'totally', 'stunning', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Annette.Her', 'performance', 'alone', 'five-star', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'more', 'detailed', 'explanation', 'why', 'character', 'shares', 'psychic', 'link', 'Downey', 'Also', 'relationship', 'husband', 'not', 'totally', 'fleshed', 'out', 'how', 'did', 'Downey', 'character', 'survive', 'living', 'abandoned', 'orchard', 'questions', 'resolutions', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'five', 'stars', 'nonetheless', 'quot', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'kind', 'thriller', 'even', 'credits', 'have', 'finished.Also', 'kudos', 'Jordan', 'use', 'songs', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ebb', 'Tide', 'quot', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Sit', 'Apple', 'Tree', 'quot', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'title', 'theme', 'are', 'haunting', 'sure', 'rock', 'crap', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'most', 'today', 'movies.Watch', 'enjoy', 'really', 'different', 'thriller']",In Dreams

Had it not bothered with as linear a storyline and just followed the dream-logic plotlines it may have been hailed as a David Lynch-like fairy tale nightmare; add more violence and it could be a Dario Argento film.  But instead we have something by Neil Jordan, who gives this film more wonder and magic (albeit dark) than anyone else could.  I think it's a great film.  See, it's called In Dreams, not In Logic.  Its surreality is its strength, staying visually spectacular at all times and boosted by an absolutely great performance by Annette Bening.  I think the plot contrivances are almost subversive; OF COURSE there are moments of coincidence because that's what happens in dreams.  Moments of opportunity or clarity (claire-ity?) arrive for our heroine and she takes them in stride.  The film's general feel is continuously reinforced by the eerie flooded dream village in the reservoir, and the fairy tale orchard.

This point is made even more pronouncedly when the dreams happen to be about things that are occurring or are going to happen, especially when they teeter on the edge of insanity, or, as is the case with Claire, on areas that hit close to home. For several nights now she has been seeing visions of an apple orchard and a figure leading a little girl through it, leading her to believe that the child in her mind might well be a little girl that has gone missing. So, with an outstretched mentality, her mind goes searching, looking for something which she can clamp onto. Unfortunately for her, the mirror sometimes has a darker side, one that can peer into the mind that dreams visions, and that hands that can effectively whittle away many of the pieces that lead a person toward happiness, security, and the warmth that we like to call home.In dreams had some beautiful depictions within it, capturing the aura of a town floating beneath waters unleashed by river diversion, showing a person in the first few minutes that it had a surreal feeling to it and that there was the ability to seem frightfully eerie running laps through its veins. This was further accented by the visions that were seen throughout the film, those of children and a past foretold in the shadows of a nursery rhyme wearing a shroud of insane speech and garble imagery, keeping its viewer enmeshed in the tale that was being portrayed upon the screen. It also seemed to have a storyline going for it that was interesting until the final chase that is inevitable begins to ensue, dragging on for a time before leading toward a vindictive ending that leaves everyone shattered as sprawling in the dust and that makes up for the duration of the run. This was an interesting ride, too, because getting a handle on what exactly is going to happen is a bit hard until alter in the movie, and then its all apples from there.Combine this with the acting, which was done beautifully, the fact that the movie was something containing portions that entranced me within their bleakness, and the madness in the eyes of a Downey seems somewhat believable int he role, and you have something that is worth watching and that does the book its based on, Doll Eyes, a fair amount of justice.

One night, she dreams about a little girl being taken away by a stranger, right in her neighbourhood. When her own daughter Rebecca is kidnapped and murdered only a little later, Claire is sure about the chilling truth that her and the killer's mind are connected to each other in dreams. But nobody believes her being able to foresee the killer's next steps, as she could with her own daughter. In addition, the nervous breakdown she suffers gets her into a mental facility after a suicide attempt. And here, locked away in a padded cell, she dreams of her husband being murdered. This movie is a taut, edge-of-your-seat complex thriller. Sure, it may be a bit unrealistic, but as far as storytelling, directing and acting, it's a very good movie. Both Robert Downey Jr. and Annette Bening are outstanding. If you enjoy the work of either of these two actors, or if you enjoy complex, mind-bending thrillers, watch this.",5,In Dreams,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,976,"['Claire', 'Cooper', 'strange', 'things', 'time', 'time', 'One', 'night', 'little', 'girl', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'stranger', 'right', 'neighbourhood', 'When', 'own', 'daughter', 'Rebecca', 'kidnapped', 'murdered', 'only', 'little', 'later', 'Claire', 'sure', 'chilling', 'truth', 'killer', 'mind', 'are', 'connected', 'other', 'dreams', 'nobody', 'being', 'able', 'foresee', 'killer', 'next', 'steps', 'could', 'own', 'daughter', 'addition', 'nervous', 'mental', 'facility', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'here', 'locked', 'away', 'padded', 'cell', 'husband', 'being', 'murdered', 'movie', 'taut', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'complex', 'thriller', 'Sure', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'as', 'far', 'storytelling', 'directing', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'are', 'outstanding', 'enjoy', 'work', 'two', 'actors', 'enjoy', 'complex', 'mind-bending', 'thrillers', 'watch']",In Dreams
