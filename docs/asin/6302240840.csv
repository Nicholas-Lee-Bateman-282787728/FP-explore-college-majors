303311,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6302240840,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","It has been almost 40 years since ""All In the Family"" made its' network television debut, so much of the controversy it generated has passed deep into the archives of history. It is nearly impossible for the young person to realize how revolutionary it was at the time. Until the show appeared, network television shows about families were bland and noncontroversial fare along the lines of ""Leave It to Beaver"" and ""My Three Sons."" Suddenly, topics such as rape, atheism, homosexuality, bigotry, racial and ethnic prejudice, and conflict over the war in Vietnam were passionately being discussed in the Bunker household. By openly airing these previously taboo topics, the nation was forced to examine them and in its' own way, the show helped the nation cope with and overcome some of them.This tape, hosted by the show's producer Normal Lear, shows highlights from the show as well as comments from a wide range of viewers, conservative Christians to older couples where the partners have different views. While their reactions range from the extremely positive to extremely negative, this is an accurate portrayal of the national reaction to the show. Even the people offended by the show admit to the extent it affected them. To say that ""All In the Family"" was revolutionary television is an understatement, it completely changed the concept of network television from one where blandness was in and controversy was avoided to a position where difficult topics could be openly discussed. It is impossible to overstate the social change driven by this show and some of the most significant is demonstrated on this tape.",5,A retrospective on one of the best television shows ever aired and one that helped change the country,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,1624,"['been', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'All', 'Family', 'made', 'network', 'television', 'debut', 'so', 'much', 'controversy', 'generated', 'passed', 'deep', 'archives', 'history', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'young', 'person', 'realize', 'how', 'revolutionary', 'was', 'time', 'show', 'appeared', 'network', 'television', 'families', 'were', 'bland', 'noncontroversial', 'fare', 'lines', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'Three', 'Sons', 'Suddenly', 'topics', 'such', 'rape', 'atheism', 'homosexuality', 'bigotry', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'prejudice', 'conflict', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'were', 'passionately', 'being', 'discussed', 'Bunker', 'household', 'openly', 'airing', 'previously', 'taboo', 'topics', 'nation', 'was', 'forced', 'examine', 'own', 'way', 'show', 'helped', 'nation', 'cope', 'overcome', 'them.This', 'tape', 'hosted', 'show', 'producer', 'Normal', 'Lear', 'highlights', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'comments', 'wide', 'range', 'viewers', 'conservative', 'Christians', 'older', 'couples', 'where', 'partners', 'have', 'different', 'views', 'reactions', 'range', 'extremely', 'positive', 'extremely', 'negative', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'national', 'reaction', 'show', 'Even', 'people', 'offended', 'show', 'admit', 'extent', 'affected', 'say', 'Family', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'television', 'understatement', 'completely', 'changed', 'concept', 'network', 'television', 'one', 'where', 'blandness', 'was', 'controversy', 'was', 'avoided', 'position', 'where', 'difficult', 'topics', 'could', 'be', 'openly', 'discussed', 'impossible', 'overstate', 'social', 'change', 'driven', 'show', 'most', 'significant', 'demonstrated', 'tape']",N/A

Who cares? This series was a true revolutionary for its time and had the gonads enough to tackle real-life social issues and problems in real-life fashion, something that comedies then didn't do. This video, a compilation of highlights from the series, comes no where near capturing ALL the highlights of the program: you'd have to get cassettes of literally every episode to savor all those other highlights for which not enough time exists in this compilation. We do get the treat of some classics, like the historic kiss Sammy Davis Jr. plants on Archie while a camera captures it, ""Meathhead"" Michael's frustrating rantings to Archie about ""Tricky Dick"" and a then-bold episode where ""Dingbat"" Edith finds a lump in her breast. But some of the other highlights you won't see here are those showing Edith's evolution from passive to formidable wife, and her standing up with a strength the comes from unflappable conviction of her beliefs. We miss the powerfully devastating show where Edith escapes a sexual assault by decking her victimizer with her own birthday cake, nor do we see (or are we likely to as long as Norman Lear has his way) Archie's heartbreaking acceptance of his wife's death. Still, this compilation is a dandy and gives us just enough of an appetite to ask for more. In that respect, the late Carroll O'Connor, who pumped an amazing life into the character of Archie Bunker, and a cast of stellar other performers, has left us with an indelible and priceless legacy.",4,Some of the best moments of a landmark series,1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,1607,"['Family', 'been', 'reviewed', 're-reviewed', 'analyzed', 're-analyzed', 'till', 'little', 'anything', 'original', 'left', 'Who', 'series', 'was', 'true', 'revolutionary', 'time', 'had', 'gonads', 'enough', 'tackle', 'real-life', 'social', 'issues', 'problems', 'real-life', 'fashion', 'something', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'video', 'compilation', 'highlights', 'series', 'where', 'capturing', 'highlights', 'program', ""'d"", 'have', 'get', 'cassettes', 'literally', 'episode', 'savor', 'other', 'highlights', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'compilation', 'do', 'get', 'treat', 'classics', 'historic', 'kiss', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Jr.', 'plants', 'Archie', 'camera', 'Meathhead', 'Michael', 'frustrating', 'rantings', 'Archie', 'Tricky', 'Dick', 'then-bold', 'episode', 'where', 'Dingbat', 'Edith', 'lump', 'breast', 'other', 'highlights', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'here', 'are', 'showing', 'Edith', 'evolution', 'passive', 'formidable', 'wife', 'standing', 'up', 'strength', 'unflappable', 'conviction', 'beliefs', 'miss', 'powerfully', 'devastating', 'show', 'where', 'Edith', 'sexual', 'assault', 'decking', 'victimizer', 'own', 'birthday', 'cake', 'do', 'see', 'are', 'likely', 'as', 'long', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'way', 'Archie', 'heartbreaking', 'acceptance', 'wife', 'death', 'Still', 'compilation', 'dandy', 'just', 'enough', 'appetite', 'ask', 'more', 'respect', 'late', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'who', 'pumped', 'amazing', 'life', 'character', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'cast', 'stellar', 'other', 'performers', 'left', 'indelible', 'priceless', 'legacy']",N/A

303314,A2BX9UPWBK2I8V,6302240840,Grahame R. Davis,"[11, 11]","All in the Family is the best show of the 1970's, and possibly the greatest comedy show of all time. This tape highlights the funniest moments of the program, but to truly appreciate the genius of All in the Family,  entire episodes must be seen.  I personally have on video nearly every  episode of this wonderful show.  It is amazing that throughout a run of  almost an enitre decade, virtually every episode was thought-provoking,  shocking, heart-warming, and most of all, side-splittingly funny.  The  characters of Archie and Edith Bunker are permanently stamped on the  landscape of American television.  Archie, outrageously bigoted, was deep  down a caring and thoughtful man, who occasionally shows his ability to be  a man of intense compassion and love, especially for his loving and loyal  wife Edith.  Archie was capable of acts of incredible stupidity and  calousness, but when his family was in trouble, he always came through.  It  is a program that will never be replicated, and can simply never be topped.  It is a portrait of a narrow minded man and his innane, backwards beliefs,  but it managed to capture a nation of loyal fans.  Watching just a few  episodes of All in the Family (some of which are available from Amazon.com  on video in their entirety) only serves to emphasize how truly dull and  unimaginative American television has become.  All in the Family is likely  the best situation comedy ever on television, and certainly one of the best  programs of any sort ever.  This video showcases some of the best moments,  but only scratches the surface of this magnificent show.",5,The Best TV Show of the 1970's,955152000,"04 8, 2000",2000,1608,"['Family', 'best', 'show', '1970', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'comedy', 'show', 'time', 'tape', 'funniest', 'moments', 'program', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'genius', 'All', 'Family', 'entire', 'episodes', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'personally', 'have', 'video', 'nearly', 'episode', 'wonderful', 'show', 'amazing', 'run', 'almost', 'enitre', 'decade', 'virtually', 'episode', 'was', 'thought-provoking', 'shocking', 'heart-warming', 'most', 'side-splittingly', 'funny', 'characters', 'Archie', 'Edith', 'Bunker', 'are', 'permanently', 'stamped', 'landscape', 'American', 'television', 'Archie', 'outrageously', 'bigoted', 'was', 'deep', 'down', 'caring', 'thoughtful', 'man', 'who', 'occasionally', 'ability', 'be', 'man', 'intense', 'compassion', 'love', 'especially', 'loving', 'loyal', 'wife', 'Edith', 'Archie', 'was', 'capable', 'acts', 'incredible', 'stupidity', 'calousness', 'when', 'family', 'was', 'trouble', 'always', 'came', 'program', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'replicated', 'can', 'simply', 'never', 'be', 'topped', 'portrait', 'narrow', 'minded', 'man', 'innane', 'backwards', 'beliefs', 'managed', 'capture', 'nation', 'loyal', 'fans', 'Watching', 'just', 'few', 'episodes', 'All', 'Family', 'are', 'available', 'Amazon.com', 'video', 'entirety', 'only', 'emphasize', 'how', 'truly', 'dull', 'unimaginative', 'American', 'television', 'become', 'Family', 'likely', 'best', 'situation', 'comedy', 'ever', 'television', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'programs', 'sort', 'ever', 'video', 'best', 'moments', 'only', 'surface', 'magnificent', 'show']",N/A
