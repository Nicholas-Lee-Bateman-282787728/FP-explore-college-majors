825218,AUBO5UYMEHYZ1,B00026L9BQ,Amina Zeinu,"[10, 10]","I have never really watched any of Chris Rock's stand up's, but when I rented ""never scared,"" I thought it was the funniest stand up I've ever seen. Chris Rock is really funny in this, and what I like is that he makes so much sense when he's talking about politics, or pretty much anything that affects us in our every day lives. I've read some of the review's that some people wrote, thinking  that some of the things that Chris Rock says about white people seem to be prejudice. I didn't think that at all, and neither did my mom (who's white), and who loved it. I asked her after we watched it, if she was offended by any of the stuff he was saying when he started mentioning race, and she said she wasn't. The way I look at is, Chris Rock is a very intelligent person, who's just speaking the truth about history, and how there still is racism out there. The whole show isn't about race, he talks about other issues too that make all of us think, politics, war, drugs and other things. He's serious when he talks about this stuff, but he also does it in a way that will make you laugh. Overall he's a real funny, smart person. I reccomend watching this, watch it with your friends, or with some people in your family, maybe it will make them think about certain things, and of course also laugh. Some people who've watched this say ""Oh it's not like ""Bigger and Blacker,"" or it's not like ""Bring the pain,"", yah, because it's different. Obvioulsy anytime Chris Rock comes out with a new stand up, it's going to be different from his others. I don't think some people understand that when you get older and you're a comedian, you're not going to keep writing about the same stuff all the time, it's going to be different each time. No matter what, I think his stand ups will always be funny. Also, the people out there who are offended by his race jokes, when he's talking about white people, you guys need to chill out. Do you actually think that he's going to stand up there and put down white people, when he knows that he has fans that are white?  get real. He's just speaking the truth about certain things, maybe the people who don't like what he's saying about how there still is racisim out there, are afraid to hear it. Alot of us have a little bit of prejudice in us, and Chris Rock just tells it like it is. Overall, I really liked this stand up of his, and I recommend wathching it.

As he warms up though, talking about strippers and rap music, he goes on a crescendo.

In a sense, it was classic Chris Rock, but that was also the problem.Rock's comedy focuses on relationships, politics, government, race relations, and now parenthood (since Rock is now a parent).  There is plenty of material for Chris to draw upon, but the problem I had was just that he wasn't as funny as he has been in the past.  This was a new comedy special, but it felt like the same old material, only not quite as funny.  Don't get me wrong, Chris Rock is still a very funny man, but this performance was not at the level that I have come to expect from Chris Rock.

I honestly think this is one of the most insighful comedic dialogues regarding social contradiction, relationships, wealthyy vs. rich and  politics.

Highly recommended for Rock fans and those who can accept racy language in pursuit of a good laugh, NEVER SCARED is more than funny.  It's observational humor at its best, whipped up from a precise recipe of three parts cheek-aching laughs and one part disturbing reality.Maybe not as great as ""Bring the Pain"" -- which will go down in history as one of the most successful comedy performances ever -- NEVER SCARED (2004) is nonetheless a great DVD that Rock fans will love.Due to its adult content, obviously this DVD is not appropriate for young children -- and possibly not even your friends/relatives.  But just when you wonder how many times Rock can throw a curse into a sentence, he offers viewers a universally true observation that cuts to the core of the realities of American popular culture and male-female relationships.I agree with some viewers here who note the concert begins awkwardly.  After viewing it a dozen times, I think Rock looks nervous as he struts onto the stage and immediately notes that the main responsibility of fathers is to keep their daughters off the stripper's pole.  Though the bit has enormous potential, Rock looks too vulnerable to make it work as well as later jokes.After discussing strippers and his increasingly reluctant love of rap music, Rock begins to look more comfortable and starts to hit his stride when he discusses the antics of Michael Jackson and his eccentric family, troubled R&B; singer R. Kelly, magician David Blaine and Kobe Bryant.But truth be told, almost any good comedian could deliver these celebrity-oriented jokes/observations, but what makes Rock unique is his ability to charm the audience with discussions of serious subjects like American patriotism, abortion, ignorant bipartisan politics and marriage.In a nutshell this is why I love and admire Chris Rock.

There will no doubt be people who won't like his truth, but I can't do anything but respect it and crack up laughing because I agree with every single detail of it.

Here, he seems almost bitter, his timing is off and the program loses momentum quite early. His rants about The Jacksons, R.Kelly, who ""real Americans"" are and his thoughts on marriage are the strongest bits, but the remainder of this material is woefully lacking in humor and often gets too repetitive to be enjoyable.
