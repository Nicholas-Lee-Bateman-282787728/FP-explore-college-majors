329415,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302720419,Austin Somlo,"[1, 3]","Viewed: 10/04, 7/12Rate: 27/12: I knew every time I see Courtney Gains in Children of the Corny, I would be in deep trouble. Remember the other film that he tried to act like he was in a gang? Now, that was bad. The worst acting award went to John Franklin for the character of Isaac. A lot of times, he was frothing at his mouth in a quaint way while spitting out words in order to make himself a real cult leader. Nice try, but mmm, nope...not going to work. Now, how about the IQ on Burt? For a medical doctor, he sure was dumb. When one goes into a town that is completely barren and sees only kids running around, it's not too hard to put 2 and 2 together within few minutes. Then, when a phone is dead in one area while the caf&eacute; is completely abandoned not to mention the town hall, the police station, etc., it's not too hard to put 2 and 2 together within few minutes. Yet he keeps walking around the town and looking for a working phone. What the hell? Forget the phone! Even if he finds one that actually works, what good does it do for him? Hmm, one identifiable trait that is always annoying in every horror film is when the characters decide to split up for some nebulous purpose and it actually dooms the individual characters. This is what happened in Children of the Corny with Burt and Vicky. And why? What is the purpose? And why? Also, when Burt found Sarah in the house, the most plausible thing he could have done was to ask her many, many, many questions. Yet Burt gave up after several questions and left the house to look for *gasp* a working phone! When Burt entered a church and witnessed a ritual pre-sacrifice, he got stabbed in the chest by the crazed girl with a good six inch blade. I believe that sort of thing would have punctured his lung. Yet he managed to overcome that and had plenty of energy to do a lot of heavy duty work afterwards. That kind of thing in reality really takes superhuman strength to do that. At the end of the film, let's not forget that the boy was run over in the middle of the road, he must be smelling so bad in the trunk of the car. I believe the word is ""hit and run"" or ""manslaughter."" Finally, let's go for the Obvious Moment of the Day. Any time you can't see beyond due to the height of the corn stalks, just...uh get on the top of the car and scope the field out, for starters. When you get to a house or a barn, get to the roof. That much of height will be enough to help out instead of going to the middle of the corn rows randomly. Let's see...have I mentioned how corny these kids were? I thought Children of the Corny was a funny film, and it got funnier when Courtney Gains (stupid nitwit) was screaming, ""Outlander!"" while Burt was in the cellar of some house. Like he would hear him. Moron. Anyway, guns are really useful, okay? Finally, the concept of the film couldn't work because all of the towns are interconnected. It would take minutes for drifters to drive through the town, and out of many, there will be enough to raise an alarm. Plus, these folks do have out of town relatives. Then, there are companies and banks that are connected to others. The regional managers will know that something's wrong. The public service fixtures get state and federal funds, and the comptroller will know something is amiss if the funding isn't being used. All in all, Children of the Corny is really bad.",1,"Burt...Burt...Forget the Phone, 'Kay?",1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,3381,"['Viewed', '10/04', '7/12Rate', '27/12', 'knew', 'time', 'see', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'Children', 'Corny', 'would', 'be', 'deep', 'trouble', 'Remember', 'other', 'film', 'tried', 'act', 'was', 'gang', 'Now', 'was', 'bad', 'worst', 'acting', 'award', 'went', 'John', 'Franklin', 'character', 'Isaac', 'lot', 'times', 'was', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'quaint', 'way', 'spitting', 'out', 'words', 'order', 'make', 'real', 'cult', 'leader', 'Nice', 'try', 'mmm', 'nope', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'Now', 'how', 'IQ', 'Burt', 'medical', 'doctor', 'sure', 'was', 'dumb', 'When', 'one', 'town', 'completely', 'barren', 'only', 'kids', 'running', 'around', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'put', '2', '2', 'together', 'few', 'minutes', 'Then', 'when', 'phone', 'dead', 'one', 'area', 'caf', 'eacute', 'completely', 'abandoned', 'not', 'mention', 'town', 'hall', 'police', 'station', 'etc.', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'put', '2', '2', 'together', 'few', 'minutes', 'walking', 'town', 'looking', 'working', 'phone', 'What', 'hell', 'Forget', 'phone', 'Even', 'one', 'actually', 'what', 'good', 'do', 'Hmm', 'one', 'identifiable', 'trait', 'always', 'annoying', 'horror', 'film', 'when', 'characters', 'decide', 'split', 'up', 'nebulous', 'purpose', 'actually', 'individual', 'characters', 'what', 'happened', 'Children', 'Corny', 'Burt', 'Vicky', 'why', 'What', 'purpose', 'why', 'Also', 'when', 'Burt', 'found', 'Sarah', 'house', 'most', 'plausible', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'ask', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'questions', 'Burt', 'gave', 'up', 'several', 'questions', 'left', 'house', 'look', '*gasp*', 'working', 'phone', 'When', 'Burt', 'entered', 'church', 'witnessed', 'ritual', 'pre-sacrifice', 'got', 'stabbed', 'chest', 'crazed', 'girl', 'good', 'six', 'inch', 'blade', 'believe', 'sort', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'punctured', 'lung', 'managed', 'overcome', 'had', 'plenty', 'energy', 'do', 'lot', 'heavy', 'duty', 'work', 'afterwards', 'kind', 'thing', 'reality', 'really', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'do', 'end', 'film', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'boy', 'was', 'run', 'over', 'middle', 'road', 'must', 'be', 'smelling', 'so', 'bad', 'trunk', 'car', 'believe', 'word', 'hit', 'run', 'manslaughter', 'Finally', 'let', 'go', 'Obvious', 'Moment', 'Day', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'due', 'height', 'corn', 'stalks', 'just', 'uh', 'get', 'top', 'car', 'scope', 'field', 'out', 'starters', 'When', 'get', 'house', 'barn', 'get', 'roof', 'much', 'height', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'help', 'out', 'instead', 'going', 'middle', 'corn', 'randomly', 'Let', 'see', 'have', 'mentioned', 'how', 'corny', 'kids', 'were', 'thought', 'Children', 'Corny', 'was', 'funny', 'film', 'got', 'funnier', 'when', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'stupid', 'nitwit', 'was', 'screaming', 'Outlander', 'Burt', 'was', 'cellar', 'house', 'would', 'hear', 'Moron', 'Anyway', 'guns', 'are', 'really', 'useful', 'okay', 'Finally', 'concept', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'work', 'towns', 'are', 'interconnected', 'would', 'take', 'minutes', 'drifters', 'drive', 'town', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'raise', 'alarm', 'folks', 'do', 'have', 'town', 'relatives', 'Then', 'are', 'companies', 'banks', 'are', 'connected', 'others', 'regional', 'managers', 'will', 'know', 'something', 'wrong', 'public', 'service', 'fixtures', 'get', 'state', 'federal', 'funds', 'comptroller', 'will', 'know', 'something', 'amiss', 'funding', ""n't"", 'being', 'used', 'Children', 'Corny', 'really', 'bad']",Children of the Corn VHS

But I had read this one (originally a short story), and I had seen clips, and I figured being so old, it wouldn't be as disgusting as the later films. Yeah, OK, sort of.In a small town in Nebraska, one day three years ago (says the film), all those under 19 rose up and slaughtered all the adults. They are led by a religious fanatic who had been a child preacher before he came to the town, and knew how to manipulate the children to do his bidding. Just goes to show you people should not use kids for preachers. But anyway.Cut to a handsome young couple (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) who are passing through on their way to a vacation in Seattle. They were driving down a back road near the cursed town when a boy ran out in front of their car. They couldn't avoid hitting him, but it turns out his throat had been cut back in the corn field, where the couple found his suitcase covered in blood. They put the body in the trunk of the car and take the suitcase with them and drive off to find someone to report the murder to.An old guy working on a truck at a gas station that has no gas directs them to a town 19 miles away, and warns them against the nearby town, which is full of religious fanatics who don't like strangers. He's wrong about that. They want the strangers: they need them to sacrifice to He Who Walks Behind (between?) the Rows.I think I'd have liked this better if it turned out to just be psychosis and manipulation on the part of Isaac, the young preacher, and Malachi, his bloodthirsty henchmen. But there's a supernatural element involved in the nature of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Exactly who or what he is never becomes clear.Still, I guess it's worth watching.

King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields.

The charachters of Isac and Malicai (spelling) are interesting as a conecept but they are not developed nearly enough. The acting is also very inconsistent and whilst the actor that portrays Isac does a great job the rest of the acting is anywhere from b movie acting (the hero) to downright shoddy (his girlfriend). The music is great at times but other times it feels like it was done as an afterthought. The special effects are quite cheap looking and the end could have been so much more. Still I will watch the rest of this series just out of sheer curiosity and still it is not a bad movie.

But, at the same time, it is no disasterpiece, either.  I'm a big-time Stephen King fan, and while this is the film adaptation of his work that comes in for the most lambasting, it is really nowhere near the worst King film.  (Look to either ""Thinner"" or to ""Sleepwalkers"" for that odious distinction.)I'm not going to say much about the movie, really.  It is what it is, and odds are that you already know whether or not you like this sort of thing.Instead, I'd like to focus on the features done for this special edition DVD.  First off, the picture and the sound quality are WAY better than might have been expected (or possibly even deserved).  The film has probably never looked or sounded better, even when it was first released.The documentary is about 35 minutes long, and relies on interviews with director Fritz Kiersch (who comes off as a knowledgeable and likeable man) and the actors who portrayed Isaac and Malachi (both of whom are funny and relazed about what they realize ain't exactly the finest thing since Citizen Kane).  It's a good documentary, although perhaps a bit too quick to try and posit the film as an overwhelming success.  The commentary track features the same participants, and is a good listen.Not surprisingly, Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton ar enowhere to be found in the supplements, and don't even dream of an interview with Stephen King, for you will find one not.All in all, this is a fine special edition for a not-that-fine movie.But I can't help liking it, for some reason...",3,good special edition DVD,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,1617,"['Gosh', 'what', 'say', 'Children', 'Corn', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'masterpiece', 'same', 'time', 'disasterpiece', 'either', ""'m"", 'big-time', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fan', 'film', 'adaptation', 'work', 'most', 'lambasting', 'really', 'nowhere', 'worst', 'King', 'film', 'Look', 'Thinner', 'Sleepwalkers', 'odious', 'distinction', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'much', 'movie', 'really', 'what', 'odds', 'are', 'already', 'know', 'not', 'sort', 'thing.Instead', ""'d"", 'like', 'focus', 'features', 'done', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'First', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'WAY', 'better', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'possibly', 'even', 'deserved', 'film', 'probably', 'never', 'looked', 'sounded', 'better', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released.The', 'documentary', '35', 'minutes', 'long', 'relies', 'interviews', 'director', 'Fritz', 'Kiersch', 'who', 'off', 'knowledgeable', 'likeable', 'man', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Isaac', 'Malachi', 'whom', 'are', 'funny', 'relazed', 'what', 'realize', 'ai', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'finest', 'thing', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'good', 'documentary', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'quick', 'try', 'posit', 'film', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'commentary', 'track', 'same', 'participants', 'good', 'listen.Not', 'surprisingly', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'enowhere', 'be', 'found', 'supplements', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'dream', 'interview', 'Stephen', 'King', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'not.All', 'fine', 'special', 'edition', 'not-that-fine', 'movie.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'reason']",Children of the Corn VHS

329428,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6302720419,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[35, 45]","So how did such a mediocre film warrant six sequels (here's a hint...it's all about the money)?  There's the original. Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice (1993), Children of the Corn III (1995), Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering (1996), Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror (1998), Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return (1999), and Children of the Corn: Revelation (2001)...that's a lot of corn, or as the Native Americans call it, maize...I've seen the original, but not the subsequent sequels...my gut instinct tells me to avoid them.  Children of the Corn, aka Stephen King's Children of the Corn (1984), directed by Fritz Kiersch (Tuff Turf, Gor) features a solid cast including Peter Horton (""thirtysomething"") and Linda Hamilton (Terminator 2: Judgment Day). Also appearing is R.G. Armstrong (Dick Tracy), Courtney Gains (Colors, The 'burbs) and John Franklin, who appeared 1991 film The Addams Family, along with its' 1993 sequel, as the very hairy Cousin Itt.The film, which primarily takes place in the small farming town of Gatlin, Nebraska, begins with a flashback, relating a particularly gruesome incident in where the children depopulate the town of nearly all adults through a good old fashion bloodbath. Fast forward three years to the present, and we have Burton (Horton) and his girlfriend Vicky (Hamilton) traveling through the Midwest as Burton has recently graduated from med school, and has been offered an internship somewhere...but that's neither here nor there as the pair get lost, have an accident, and soon find themselves looking for aid in Gatlin...but guess what? Gatlin appears all but deserted...except for the children, who've formed some kind of weird cult, led by the incredibly creepy man-child Isaac (Franklin). Initially their idolatry seems to be centered on the corn, but later we learn it's not so much the corn as what lurks under the corn. Burton and Vicky soon find themselves in a world of trouble, as the corn is thirsting for holy sacrifices, and they're at the top of the list (I wouldn't mind initiating a religious ceremony with that Linda Hamilton...that is the soft and sexy Linda from the original Terminator movie, not the bony and intensely scary Linda from T2: Judgment Day)...The film is based on a Stephen King short story taken from his book Night Shift, which I've never read, but I have read a number of his other books, many of which were later adapted to film, with varying degrees of success...anyone else besides me sit through Maximum Overdrive? Okay, Children of the Corn isn't as bad as that was, but it is lacking something...it's not the acting...Horton, whom I despise for no other reason than he was on that TV show `thirtysomething' was actually pretty good. As far as Linda Hamilton, well, I think she's a good actress, provided she's given something to work with, and that wasn't the case here. The real fun is watching the performances of Franklin and Gains, as Isaac and Malachai, respectively. Franklin is extremely disconcerting as the leader of the group, mainly because his appearance is that of a child, but a closer look would make you think twice as his face and voice seem to indicate some much older. Turns out Franklin, who suffered from some sort of hormone deficiency, was actually much older, like 23 at the time of the film's release. As far as Gains, he presents the most intense performance as Isaac's enforcer and right hand man, but I felt like he got into it just a little too much (in the featurette Gains speaks of his craft and how he brought his character to the screen...I do appreciate it when actors give to the screen, but I think Gains took his modest role a bit too seriously, trying to make more of it than it was...but since the production in general was pretty bland, this overacting wasn't necessarily unwelcome). These two guys come off really good as the antagonists, mainly because they're so completely annoying I wanted to beat them both to a pulp (wait for the scene when Malachai is walking down the center of the street calling for Burton to come out, yelling `Outlander!""...you'll understand what I mean by annoying). As far as the direction, I have no real complaints, as Kiersch seems capable...in the featurette he speaks a lot of what he was trying to accomplish with regards to the sense of direction, and in some areas I think he met his goal, but others I think his aspirations extended beyond his capabilities. So what's the problem with the film? It's the story...well, not the original story, but the adaptation of the story. As I said, I'm familiar with many of King's works, and I know he takes a lot of time to craft his tales, utilizing detail like it was going out of style. I think one of the things that makes his story so popular is his ability to paint a visual using words...and he also seems to do this in terms that are accessible to an extremely wide audience. And I think this is a main factor that ends up hurting many of the films that are adapted from his novels...they lack the focus on what's important to the story. I think this is why we are seeing his more recent works produced as television mini-series...because more time can be spent developing the story and presenting the details, in my opinion.The Divimax edition, released by Anchor Bay Entertainment features a really sharp looking wide screen (1.85:1) print, enhanced for 16 X 9 TV's, and the audio is exceptionally clear and crisp. Special features include a new 39 minute documentary titled Harvesting Horror, an audio commentary by the director, the producer, actors Franklin and Gains, trailer, poster and still gallery, screenplay, storyboard art, title sequence art, and a mini reproduction of poster for the film inside the DVD case.Cookieman108",3,And a child shall lead them...,1107993600,"02 10,

329430,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6302720419,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Children of the Corn isn't a bad movie, but it is certainly not very scary.  When I was young and this movie was new, my conception of the movie was wrapped in an aura of fright, but now that I have finally watched it, I don't know where that aura came from.  The theme of the movie is nothing new, really, but it has real potential by its very nature.  In Gatlin, Nebraska, there are virtually no adults; the children, led by the young and powerful Isaac with the help of head goon Malachai, murdered all of the adults in the name of religious mania.  He Who Walks Behind the Rows made himself known to Isaac, and that is where all the trouble started three years earlier.  Only two children are not active participants in the twisted religion of Gatlin children-Job and Sarah.  Sara has the ""gift of sight,"" oftentimes revealing future events in her crayon drawings.  Now two strangers have come to town, having run over an already murdered youngster who had tried to escape through the corn fields.  The fate of adults in town is not really a deep secret, but our heroes stumble around idiotically, wising up only when the children have made their move.John Franklin gives an impressive performance as the young prophet Isaac, adding a real sense of realism this movie had to have in order to work.  Courtney Gains plays his character Malachai very well, but unfortunately the ""farm implement of death""-happy Malachai is one of the most annoying characters in the history of moviemaking.  Our unsuspecting adult ""interlopers"" are OK but not outstanding; Peter Horton gives a credible yet unspectacular performance, and a pre-Terminator Linda Hamilton serves the necessary function of generating sympathy for the grown-ups.  The children Job and Sarah are likeable, but the fact that Job serves as the film's de facto narrator gives a part of the story away fairly early on.One is left with any number of questions after viewing the film.  Since the murder of the town's adults took place three years prior to the arrival of the interlopers, why do even the youngest kids look exactly the same?  Why do some seem too old to be children to start with?  Who plants all this corn, anyway, and why wouldn't the ill-fated runaway choose to escape during winter, when the corn would presumably be much easier to navigate?  Why are the two adults so slow-witted?  The movie begs many more questions than it answers.  One is also hard pressed to figure out what exactly He Who Walks Behind the Rows really is.  The special effects witnessed at the concluding moments of the movie are unspectacular and unilluminating, and the conclusion does little more than simply bring the movie to a close.  The adults' reactions to events are often inconsistent and seemingly peculiar, at times making the plot sound as weak as it sometimes is.  I won't blame Stephen King for the faults of this film adaptation of his work, particularly given the fact that it takes great liberty with his original short story.

329431,A1SSKWISW4QWVX,6302720419,Daniel T. SWan,"[0, 0]","I remember watching this movie when I was really young; by the stars the movie creeped me out. Later here in my adult life I've watched it again, and here's my take on the movie... good, bad, or indifferent. Stephan King's short story of this title in Night Shift was and still is in my opinion a good look at what a cult structure can spawn, and who better to manipulate that children; young people who never experienced the outside world, shielded from it by the small town stigma to the fullest. Along comes a supernatural entity that provokes, manipulates, and in the end controls the minds of the young. of a small town in Nebraska. Obviously the town itself (Gatlin) is fictional, but the manipulation of children through a religious cult is not fictional.... it happens every day. Off topic.... okay, this movie as far as the time period in when it was made was wonderfully done in my opinion. The horrible demise of the couple in the book does not happen in the movie, along with other Hollywood interferences in the story. Still, this movie is a five star rating in my opinion, due to the creepy soundtrack, the claustrophobia of a small town (done very well), and the fact that children were used as the catalyst for the demon to take over the entire town, and when you really think about it, I would use this movie as a reminder of what could happen when cults take over the minds of young people who have no sense of right and wrong outside of their little guidelines layed upon them by &#34;He who Walks Behind the Rows&#34;, fanatics, or anything that deals in absolutes in an ever changing world and society.....

329432,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,6302720419,DarthJustice,"[0, 0]","Children of the Corn is a 1984 horror movie based on a Stephen King story of the same name. In the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, life is going on as normal one Sunday morning. The adults in town have just gotten out of church while all but two children are in the local cornfields with a mysterious boy named Isaac, whom the one kid's father doesn't like or trust.After services end, the children with Isaac begin their attacks and suddenly murder every one of the adults in the town. Three years later, Isaac and the town's kids have continued living their isolated existence when a dating couple, played by Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton, stumble (or should I say 'drive') across a teenager who, like the other two kids not in the field that day, knew the evils in Gatlin had tried escaping but was caught and murdered.This leads the couple into town where the kids under Isaac's leadership decide to bring them and sacrifice them to their god, known only as He Who Walks Behind The Rows. The couple must now protect the two kids on their side as well as bring an end to the murdering child cult.CotC is what I think to be one of the better made Stephen King adaptions. The movie is an entertaining horror movie in its own right as well. As for the actual blu-ray itself, I have no complaints there. It looks nice enough. So far I've only used one of the special features, the function where trivia pops up on screen and every once in a while. It does give some nice background on different scenes.Is it worth a buy?

329434,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,6302720419,Dave. K,"[4, 6]","THE CHILDREN OF THE CORN*** Out of 5Release Date- March 9th, 1984Running Time- 92-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- George Goldsmith (Story by Stephen King)Director- Fritz KierschStarring- Peter Horton, Linda Hamilton, R.G. Armstrong, John Franklin, Courtney Gaines, Robby Kiger, Anne Marie McEvoyReleased in 1984 Children of the Corn is based off a short story of the same name written by Stephen King; Children of the Corn was first published in 1977 in Penthouse and than later in part of King's short story collection Night Shift.Children of the Corn wasn't one of King's better stories in my opinion, but it wasn't bad or anything. It was an enjoyable piece, but in the end nothing special so I suppose it's only fitting the movie adaptation ends up being nothing special as well. Some people say King's work isn't suited well for film due to his writing style. I have to disagree with that; I think most of King's work is perfectly suited for film, but for the most part it seems many haven't translated well on film. King's work while sometimes violent is almost always character driven and that is what makes his novels and short stories work so well. In general horror is always about believing the impossible and that works best when the characters are well developed.The fact Stephen King has created such excellent characters is the reason why his work has excelled; it's not easy basing a movie off of a book. You have the groundwork already done, but a lot of character development often gets lost and some of King's work turned into films have been duds like The Dark Half or average at best like Desperation, but The Dead Zone and Carrie were two prime examples of how well King's work can translate onto film. With Children of the Corn I don't think the story was good enough to be made into a 90-minute film. If anything I think this would have worked better as a short film or even an episode of a TV series. Again that's not to say the short story was bad or anything. It was enjoyable, but not one of King's stronger stories.The screenplay by George Goldsmith was rather sub-par filled with some silly dialogue, but works well due to the silliness. The one area I do feel the screenplay improved upon the short story were with the lead characters of Burt played by Peter Horton and Vicky played  by Linda Hamilton. Like I said earlier Stephen King's strong suit are his characters, but Burt and Vicky weren't among his best. I personally found them rather annoying and mostly un-likeable and here in the film version I thought they were a lot more likeable. The short story was 29-pages and the film runs at 90-minutes so obviously changes will be made; the changes made by George Goldsmith never improve on the original story, but I wouldn't say they were inferior either.The script by Goldsmith as stated before is filled with some silly dialogue and overall Children of the Corn is poorly written, but in the poor writing it does actually make it fun. There is very little character development and the plot isn't really expanded on all that much, but it works well due to the poor writing and makes it campy fun. Like I said before the only real improvement for me was the main characters; I found Burt and Vicky more likeable in the film than the short story and in the story they spend most of their time arguing where as here in the film their relationship is still strong. My biggest complaint with the script though is the ending; the ending isn't dark like the short story and I personally felt was a cop out.Fritz Kiersch makes his directorial debut and I'll give him credit due to the fact Children of the Corn had a very low budget, which shows at times, but doesn't look any cheaper than other low budget flicks of the same era. But besides making a decent looking film on a low budget he doesn't get much right besides that, which some limitations are due to the script though. The pacing isn't all that bad, but it's never really exciting either; Fritz Kiersch stated that when it came to the violence he wanted it more suggested than shown to do something like Alfred Hitchcock used to do. Most of the violence is just that suggested; we never see anything, but some blood splatter, which would be ok in a better movie. No offense to Fritz Kiersch, but he isn't Hitchcock and shouldn't attempt to do what he did. Children of the Corn is a movie that really could have used a lot more gore.Some scenes are quite silly and over the top that it can be hard to keep a straight face while watching it, but some of that can also be blamed on the very poor acting from most of the cast. There is very little in the way of suspense and tension, but to Fritz Kiersch credit he does at least attempt it. Some scenes with Burt and Vicky going around the town of Gatlin can be semi creepy, which is more to do with the location than directing, but these scenes at least work some what decently, but another problem was the whole film was shot in the daytime except the final act and some of these scenes would have worked slightly better with a nighttime shoot.The acting was rather terrible with the exception of Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton who give good performances despite the weak script; Courtney Gaines ended up becoming a solid actor, but here he wasn't very good and does add to the whole so bad its good vibe, which can partly be blamed on the silly things he has to say. I suppose it isn't easy to sound good with the idiotic lines he has, but Gaines has improved over the years. John Franklin as Isaac didn't fair much better; he is sort of creepy, but his performance was the icing on the cake for the so bad it's good.The rest of the cast range from terrible to below average; one of my problems with the short story and film was I just couldn't fully buy into the concept, but with such weak acting it doesn't exactly help matters. Horton and Hamilton both work well together and manage to sell some really silly stuff.My review for Children of the Corn may not sound good, but the movie really wasn't very good, but it is an enjoyable movie in how poor it was. The whole so bad its good vibe is on full effect and despite how poor the film was it does work due to that and is enjoyable, but you can easily find movies on the same level far more enjoyable. Amazingly there were several sequels made I don't think the original was good enough to warrant any (or if anything as many) and while I haven't seen all of them of the ones I've seen this is probably the best of the bunch, which is actually quite scary.The Blu-ray release is top notch; Anchor Bay delivers a solid transfer, but obviously don't expect a pristine print. Due to the age of the film anything less than a full re-master there is only so good the picture can look. But the transfer is very good and there is some grain to be found and some dirt, but Anchor Bay delivers an excellent transfer. There are also some new features that cover the behind the scenes and they are all informative; Even though the movie is enjoyable in the so bad its good level the disc is far better than maybe the movie deserved.",3,"Average at best, but an excellent Blu-ray release",1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,7115,"['CHILDREN', 'THE', 'CORN***', 'Out', '5Release', 'Date-', 'March', '9th', '1984Running',

That is crazy...I think King's original short story was around 20 pages.Of course, as a lover of Bad Movies, I can't wait to watch them all.With that said, I remember this first entry very well. I actually saw this one in theaters when I was about the same age as Malachi, and remember really enjoying it. I've seen it a few times of the years, but it has been at least two decades since my last visit to Gatlin, Nebraska and thought it was time to give it another view...along with the sequels.As the film begins we see events unfold in Gatlin, Nebraska, a small farming community suffering from drought. In the opening moments of the film, thanks to narrator Job, we learn that most of the kids have fallen under the spell of Isaac, a new kid in town who happens to be a preacher. One Sunday after church, all of the kids in Gatlin begin murdering all of the adults in town. Job sees his father cut down in front of him, and only Job and his sister Sarah have not fallen under Isaac's spell.Flash forward 3 years and we meet, Burt and Vicky, a young couple traveling to Seattle where Burt has taken a job as an ER doctor. And of course they decide to get off the highway and end up traveling through the 2-lane countryside heading towards Gatlin. While looking at a map, they run over a young boy who was trying to escape Gatlin and it's cult. When Burt examines the boy's body he notices his throat is cut, and that he was already dying when he was struck by the car. Looking to report the crime, the young couple drive through the corn and into Gatlin where they'll meet the Children of the Corn.I was surprised at how well this film holds up!! The F/X are still pretty solid (well the climax is bit cartoony..but still good), and the acting is really good for a B-Movie. Specifically the kids who play Isaac, Malachi and Job. Malachi in particular has a real menace that comes across on screen, and Isaac just out and out creepy. Linda Hamilton is always fun to watch as the damsel in distress.I highly recommend this first entry...now bring on the sequels!",4,He Who Walks Behind The Rows Should Be Pleased,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,2175,"['never', 'realized', 'how', 'many', '34', 'Children', 'Corn', '34', 'movies', 'are', 'think', 'are', 'up', '9', 'total', 'crazy', 'think', 'King', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'was', '20', 'pages.Of', 'course', 'lover', 'Bad', 'Movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'all.With', 'said', 'remember', 'first', 'entry', 'very', 'well', 'actually', 'saw', 'one', 'theaters', 'when', 'was', 'same', 'age', 'Malachi', 'remember', 'really', 'enjoying', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'years', 'been', 'least', 'two', 'decades', 'last', 'visit', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'thought', 'was', 'time', 'give', 'view', 'sequels.As', 'film', 'see', 'events', 'unfold', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'small', 'farming', 'community', 'suffering', 'drought', 'opening', 'moments', 'film', 'thanks', 'narrator', 'Job', 'learn', 'most', 'kids', 'have', 'fallen', 'spell', 'Isaac', 'new', 'kid', 'town', 'who', 'be', 'preacher', 'One', 'Sunday', 'church', 'kids', 'Gatlin', 'begin', 'murdering', 'adults', 'town', 'Job', 'father', 'cut', 'down', 'front', 'only', 'Job', 'sister', 'Sarah', 'have', 'not', 'fallen', 'Isaac', 'spell.Flash', 'forward', '3', 'years', 'meet', 'Burt', 'Vicky', 'young', 'couple', 'traveling', 'Seattle', 'where', 'Burt', 'taken', 'job', 'ER', 'doctor', 'course', 'decide', 'get', 'off', 'highway', 'end', 'up', 'traveling', '2-lane', 'countryside', 'heading', 'towards', 'Gatlin', 'looking', 'map', 'run', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'escape', 'Gatlin', 'cult', 'When', 'Burt', 'boy', 'body', 'throat', 'cut', 'was', 'already', 'dying', 'when', 'was', 'struck', 'car', 'Looking', 'report', 'crime', 'young', 'couple', 'drive', 'corn', 'Gatlin', 'where', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'Children', 'Corn.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'up', 'F/X', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'solid', 'well', 'climax', 'bit', 'cartoony..but', 'still', 'good', 'acting', 'really', 'good', 'B-Movie', 'Specifically', 'kids', 'who', 'play', 'Isaac', 'Malachi', 'Job', 'Malachi', 'particular', 'real', 'menace', 'screen', 'Isaac', 'just', 'out', 'creepy', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'damsel', 'distress.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'first', 'entry', 'now', 'bring', 'sequels']",Children of the Corn VHS

329440,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,6302720419,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 2]","""...but it's safe."" is how the rest of the line goes.  But when the film begins with the slaughtering of adults in a small Nebraska town by all the children, it's far from that.  Children of the Corn is a unique horror film in that it blends children and cornfields, but other than that, this is a pretty lame and average scarefest.Gatlin is the small Nebraska town where the action takes place.  Gatlin is now a ghost town, because the adults are ""in the cornfields"".  In other words, sacrificed by the orders of ""Isaac"" (John Franklin) the leader of the strange cult consisting of all children 18 years and younger.  Isaac teaches what he sees from the Bible, and even the assumption we get that the film's main character Burt is weary of Christianity, he still points out that these events are ridiculous and obsured.Burt and Vicky are the unlucky young adults who travel through Gatlin, and end up getting trapped there due to roadsigns that have been misplaced to keep outlanders stuck.  Obviously, since the town is dry of adults, the children are always looking for visitors to sacrifice.  The majority of the film is slow paced, though mildly entertaining with suspense and chases.  The blood and gore factor is actually quite minimal, and nothing compared to today's standards.  Most of the time, the camera will pull away before someone is murdered.The characters in this film are primarily the children and the two young adults.  Only Isaac and his henchman Malachai stood out with the most interest, looking and talking with decent intimidation, but in the end their lack of acting (as well as everyone else) keeps things at bay.  Horror movies aren't usually known for good acting, but this is below those standards.Overall, the film has some originality to it and is worth a look, though its more of a way to kill 90 minutes it would seem.  It scares a bit here and there for the most part.  Apparently, though, someone liked it since it spawned 7 more sequals, though none of those really improved over this.Acting - 2Characters - 3Horror - 3Story - 3.5Overall - 3.5",3,"[3.5] ""It's a little weird out here...""",1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,2081,"['safe', 'how', 'rest', 'line', 'when', 'film', 'slaughtering', 'adults', 'small', 'Nebraska', 'town', 'children', 'far', 'Children', 'Corn', 'unique', 'horror', 'film', 'children', 'cornfields', 'other', 'pretty', 'lame', 'average', 'scarefest.Gatlin', 'small', 'Nebraska', 'town', 'where', 'action', 'place', 'Gatlin', 'now', 'ghost', 'town', 'adults', 'are', 'cornfields', 'other', 'words', 'sacrificed', 'orders', 'Isaac', 'John', 'Franklin', 'leader', 'strange', 'cult', 'consisting', 'children', '18', 'years', 'younger', 'Isaac', 'what', 'Bible', 'even', 'assumption', 'get', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Burt', 'weary', 'Christianity', 'still', 'out', 'events', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'obsured.Burt', 'Vicky', 'are', 'unlucky', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'travel', 'Gatlin', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'trapped', 'due', 'roadsigns', 'have', 'been', 'misplaced', 'keep', 'outlanders', 'stuck', 'Obviously', 'town', 'dry', 'adults', 'children', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'visitors', 'sacrifice', 'majority', 'film', 'slow', 'paced', 'though', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'suspense', 'chases', 'blood', 'gore', 'factor', 'actually', 'quite', 'minimal', 'nothing', 'compared', 'today', 'standards', 'Most', 'time', 'camera', 'will', 'pull', 'away', 'someone', 'murdered.The', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'primarily', 'children', 'two', 'young', 'adults', 'Only', 'Isaac', 'henchman', 'Malachai', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'interest', 'looking', 'talking', 'decent', 'intimidation', 'end', 'lack', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'everyone', 'else', 'things', 'bay', 'Horror', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'usually', 'known', 'good', 'acting', 'standards.Overall', 'film', 'originality', 'look', 'more', 'way', 'kill', '90', 'minutes', 'would', 'seem', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'Apparently', 'though', 'someone', 'liked', 'spawned', '7', 'more', 'sequals', 'none', 'really', 'improved', 'over', 'this.Acting', '2Characters', '3Horror', '3Story', '3.5Overall', '3.5']",Children of the Corn VHS

329447,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,6302720419,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","CHILDREN OF THE CORNThis is one of those movies that seems to divide people, some love it and consider it a classic while others not so much. I know people on both sides of the fence on this subject and have listened to them all on their thoughts. Me myself I fall somewhere in the middle since I do like the movie but admit that it is not as great as some say. In fact if you want a good one check out the first filming of this story on ""Stephen King's Nightshift Collection"" movie called ""Disciples of the Crow"". It is a better telling of the story and like the story is a short film.Based on King's short story the film follows a couple traveling the country that happen to have an accident near the town of Gatlin Nebraska. This town though is not as it seems when the couple arrive, the town has a secret that may be the end of them both. An entity known only as ""He who walks behind the rows"" has taken control of the town's children and has them following his religion. And with that control he has them kill off all adults in brutal fashion.Now it seems that those who believe that this is a classic believe so for one of a couple of reasons I think, could be wrong, have been before. Any way I think a lot of people put this as classic status because it is a King movie, and one from the 80's none the less. Now that can be easily disputed because is that really a reason to label something classic? Then of course there are those who consider it a classic because they watched it when they were young. Now for those who say that I will not debate you at all because I am guilty of that with some titles as well, so I can see that. You are not looking at it as another movie that you would judge more realistically today because it holds a special place in your heart. I am down with that because I do the same thing with movies I watched as a kid.Now on to those who hate this movie all I can say is most I have talked to did not have actual reasons for disliking it other than so many call it a classic because it is a King flick from the 80's. Now I am not talking about everybody because there are people who have actual reasons for disliking it like there are those with actual reasons to like it. Any way as for my opinion I have to say I actually like this movie, not love although there are things I love in it.Now at full length it was always going to hard to make the short story stay interesting. Don't get me wrong I think there maybe someone out there who can make the right film for this, someday maybe. In order for this to work as a full length film it would have to have suspense like crazy and atmosphere throughout the entire film. I feel like if this story could be done like the old school horror films it would be a huge success. But any way I have to say I loved the actual short story and like the movie. It has flaws of course but the idea always was interesting to me. Plus I always loved the ""He who walks behind the rows"" line, super cool line in my opinion. Then of course I thought John Franklin was creepy as child preacher Isaac, but it was Courtney Gains who stole the show. I always liked his portrayal of Malachai and the scene where he is yelling ""Outlander"" was great.Now of course the film has its flaws such as the pacing, the movie tends to move slowly at times. That seems to be the films biggest problem I think and some of the acting is not up to par. Also time has not helped that ending and its special effects which is not the movies fault I must point out but it is there. I believe director Fritz Kiersch did what he could with the adaptation since at full length it is not horrible.I have to say that no matter how I feel about the flick the DVD is great with behind the scenes stuff and an excellent commentary. This is one of those commentaries in which they actually give some good behind the scenes stuff up and tell some funny stories from the set. Like the kid in the road thing with the accident at the beginning. Any way I would say if you are interested in King's films then pick up the special addition here for the special features.",4,GOOD DVD RELEASE,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,4101,"['CHILDREN', 'THE', 'CORNThis', 'one', 'movies', 'divide', 'people', 'love', 'consider', 'classic', 'while', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'know', 'people', 'sides', 'fence', 'subject', 'have', 'listened', 'thoughts', 'Me', 'fall', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'do', 'movie', 'admit', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'say', 'fact', 'want', 'good', 'one', 'check', 'first', 'filming', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Nightshift', 'Collection', 'movie', 'called', 'Disciples', 'Crow', 'better', 'telling', 'story', 'story', 'short', 'film.Based', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'film', 'couple', 'traveling', 'country', 'happen', 'have', 'accident', 'town', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'town', 'though', 'not', 'when', 'couple', 'arrive', 'town', 'secret', 'may', 'be', 'end', 'entity', 'known', 'only', 'who', 'walks', 'rows', 'taken', 'control', 'town', 'children', 'following', 'religion', 'control', 'kill', 'off', 'adults', 'brutal', 'fashion.Now', 'who', 'believe', 'classic', 'believe', 'one', 'couple', 'reasons', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'have', 'been', 'before', 'way', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'put', 'classic', 'status', 'King', 'movie', 'one', '80', 'none', 'less', 'Now', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'disputed', 'because', 'really', 'reason', 'label', 'something', 'classic', 'Then', 'course', 'are', 'who', 'consider', 'classic', 'watched', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'Now', 'who', 'say', 'will', 'not', 'debate', 'am', 'guilty', 'titles', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'not', 'looking', 'movie', 'would', 'judge', 'more', 'realistically', 'today', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'am', 'down', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'movies', 'watched', 'kid.Now', 'who', 'hate', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'most', 'have', 'talked', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'actual', 'reasons', 'disliking', 'other', 'so', 'many', 'call', 'classic', 'King', 'flick', '80', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'everybody', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'actual', 'reasons', 'disliking', 'are', 'actual', 'reasons', 'like', 'way', 'opinion', 'have', 'say', 'actually', 'movie', 'not', 'love', 'are', 'things', 'love', 'it.Now', 'full', 'length', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'hard', 'make', 'short', 'story', 'stay', 'interesting', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'think', 'maybe', 'someone', 'there', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'right', 'film', 'someday', 'maybe', 'order', 'work', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'suspense', 'crazy', 'atmosphere', 'entire', 'film', 'feel', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'old', 'school', 'horror', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'success', 'way', 'have', 'say', 'loved', 'actual', 'short', 'story', 'movie', 'flaws', 'course', 'idea', 'always', 'was', 'interesting', 'always', 'loved', 'who', 'walks', 'rows', 'line', 'super', 'cool', 'line', 'opinion', 'Then', 'course', 'thought', 'John', 'Franklin', 'was', 'creepy', 'child', 'preacher', 'Isaac', 'was', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'always', 'liked', 'portrayal', 'Malachai', 'scene', 'where', 'yelling', 'Outlander', 'was', 'great.Now', 'course', 'film', 'flaws', 'such', 'pacing', 'movie', 'move', 'slowly', 'times', 'be', 'films', 'biggest', 'problem', 'think', 'acting', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'Also', 'time', 'not', 'helped', 'ending', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'movies', 'fault', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'there', 'believe', 'director', 'Fritz', 'Kiersch', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'adaptation', 'full', 'length', 'not', 'horrible.I', 'have', 'say', 'matter', 'how', 'feel', 'flick', 'DVD', 'great', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'one', 'commentaries', 'actually', 'give', 'good', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'up', 'tell', 'funny', 'stories', 'set', 'kid', 'road', 'thing', 'accident', 'beginning', 'way', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'interested', 'King', 'films', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'special', 'addition', 'here', 'special', 'features']",Children of the Corn VHS

'Children of the Corn' is a pretty great short story, but it seems like it would be tough if not impossible to make it into a good film.  It's got a few decent moments, with a nice little massacre at the beginning, and the guy who plays Malachi is pretty cool, and that Courtney dudes 'Outlander!' speech is fun, but overall it's rather silly and uneventful.  Horton and Hamilton are incredibly dull as the leads, and they don't really get the kids right either.  They make 'em out to be like murderous Amish people, and while this may be a fairly reasonable interpretation of the story it doesn't really work.  They should be more feral, but whatever.  Also, 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' is really extraordinarily poorly done, and is a sort of murder-cloud, or something.  Also, Hamilton didn't have her eyes gouged and tongue-ripped out and the holes crammed with corn silk and husks.  Weak.Whether or not you wanna see this depends on how much you like crappy horror movies.  I like them quite a lot, but I'm certainly not gonna tell anyone they need to see this movie, even if I can't quite tell you to avoid it either.

329454,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6302720419,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 2]","The ""Children of the Corn"" is a movie that was supposed to be based on a short story by Stephen King.  The plot is creative and interesting and the movie certainly carves its own niche in the horror genre.  The acting is average to slightly above average for this type of flick.  It's not a good horror movie, but it's not bad either...it's actually fairly entertaining around Halloween.In this movie, the town of Gatlin has a serious problem.  The children have brutally murdered all of the adults including their parents.  These kids' mental problems certainly goes beyond any ordinary adolescent mischief.  It is quite clear from watching the movie that the children in this film have been brainwashed by Isaac and Malakai and they have mistaken the Devil for God or some sort of demon who is known as ""He who walks behind the rows"".The movie provides a creepy theme throughout the film on two levels.  First, you have these evil little kids who like to chop adults up into little pieces, but you also have this evil presence in the corn fields that upon your 19th birthday, it wishes to devour you.  When I was young, the movie disturbed me and I thought it was scary, but that's when I was a kid.  Now, I find it more amusing and entertaining than anything else, but I can still see why it creeped me out.The problem with this movie is that when you get older as I am now these kids are nothing more than just that, stupid kids who need a spanking.  I mean I would kick Malakai's [...] in a fight is what I'm getting around to.  Therefore, his prowess as a horror movie is diminished dramatically; this is a significant problem for this movie and it is ultimately unable to overcome it.  The main mysterious and creepy element in ""Children of the Corn"" is that of ""He who walks behind the rows"".  Because we don't know exactly what that thing looks like, it's kind of creepy.However, the ending of this movie leaves a lot to be desired.  In this sense, the potential of the movie is largely unrealized, not that it ever had the chance to be a classic, but it could have been better than it was.  Indeed, I would argue that while the first thirty minutes or so are, in a sense, kinda creepy, but the movie fails to follow up on its initial effectiveness.  I don't want to go into it because I don't want to give the whole movie away, but all in all, this is an average horror flick with some flaws, rather light on the scares but still quite entertaining; but, they won't let me give it partial star credit, so I will give it a weak 3 stars.  Nevertheless, being the horror film connoisseur that I am, I happen to own this DVD, a guilty pleasure of mine I suppose.  That being said, the bottom line is that while this is not a very good horror movie by any stretch, it's not nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be.",3,"2.65 STARS:  Entertaining for sure, but not very scary.",1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,2831,"['Children', 'Corn', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'plot', 'creative', 'interesting', 'movie', 'certainly', 'own', 'niche', 'horror', 'genre', 'acting', 'average', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'type', 'flick', 'not', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'actually', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'around', 'Halloween.In', 'movie', 'town', 'Gatlin', 'serious', 'problem', 'children', 'have', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'adults', 'including', 'parents', 'kids', 'mental', 'problems', 'certainly', 'ordinary', 'adolescent', 'mischief', 'quite', 'clear', 'watching', 'movie', 'children', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'brainwashed', 'Isaac', 'Malakai', 'have', 'mistaken', 'Devil', 'God', 'sort', 'demon', 'who', 'known', 'who', 'walks', 'rows', '.The', 'movie', 'creepy', 'theme', 'film', 'two', 'levels', 'First', 'have', 'evil', 'little', 'kids', 'who', 'like', 'chop', 'adults', 'up', 'little', 'pieces', 'also', 'have', 'evil', 'presence', 'corn', 'fields', '19th', 'birthday', 'devour', 'When', 'was', 'young', 'movie', 'disturbed', 'thought', 'was', 'scary', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Now', 'find', 'more', 'amusing', 'entertaining', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'why', 'creeped', 'out.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'when', 'get', 'older', 'am', 'now', 'kids', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'stupid', 'kids', 'who', 'need', 'spanking', 'mean', 'would', 'kick', 'Malakai', '[', ']', 'fight', 'what', ""'m"", 'getting', 'around', 'Therefore', 'prowess', 'horror', 'movie', 'diminished', 'dramatically', 'significant', 'problem', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'unable', 'overcome', 'main', 'mysterious', 'creepy', 'element', 'Children', 'Corn', 'who', 'walks', 'rows', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'thing', 'looks', 'kind', 'creepy.However', 'ending', 'movie', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'sense', 'potential', 'movie', 'largely', 'unrealized', 'not', 'ever', 'had', 'chance', 'be', 'classic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'Indeed', 'would', 'argue', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'sense', 'kinda', 'creepy', 'movie', 'follow', 'up', 'initial', 'effectiveness', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'whole', 'movie', 'away', 'average', 'horror', 'flick', 'flaws', 'rather', 'light', 'scares', 'still', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'give', 'partial', 'star', 'credit', 'will', 'give', 'weak', '3', 'stars', 'Nevertheless', 'being', 'horror', 'film', 'connoisseur', 'am', 'happen', 'own', 'DVD', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine', 'suppose', 'being', 'said', 'bottom', 'line', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'stretch', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'made', 'be']",Children of the Corn VHS
329455,AMF5LHI9IOIH1,6302720419,Irishgirl,"[4, 5]","I just bought this film around last Halloween. I'd never seen 1984's ""Children Of The Corn,"" and as a lover of Old School horror, I was anxious to watch it. I've seen horror films much, much gorier than this, but you really don't need a lot of it to have yourself a good horror flick. Sometimes just the power of suggestion is enough to scare the heck out of you. This film shows you just the right amount of both and it is an enjoyable movie for the 80's horror fans. It may be a bit too tame for the hardcore horror fans, but it's a pretty good film based on Stephen King's novel.Welcome to the sleepy town of Gatlin, Nebraska......maybe a little too sleepy.....like a dead sleepy. Indeed the town is ghostlike, save an evil religious cult of kids who have brutally slaughtered all the adults and left deranged satanic paintings and trails of cornhusks all over town. Cornhusks? Yes, cornhusks. This violent group of evil holds their main base in a huge cornfield in the lazy Nebraska flatlands. Lead by Isaac (John Franklin), a preacher who spreads the word of  ""He who walks behind the rows,"" and Malachai (Courtney Gains), Isaac's pawn who carries out the deity's wishes in the most gruesome of ways, the cult has taken Gatlin as their own and goes out to ""spill blood"" of any ""outlanders."" Oh yes, and that includes any members of the cult who decide to betray the corn deity. But this cult is strictly for youthful beings. According to ""He who walks behind the rows"": ""And a child shall lead them.""Vicky (Linda Hamilton) and Burton (Peter Horton), are two unfortunate adults who have traveled to this pitiful Nebraska town, as Burton is preparing for a job as a doctor. After getting caught in a horrible accident on the vacant road near the corn, the two decide to venture into Gatlin to seek help. They quickly find that people keep a little too much to themselves in Gatlin and all they find are shops littered with the sacrilegious corn creations and a bunch of strange youngsters wielding blades. The only bright spot they find is two little kids who have not yet been sucked in to the beliefs of the cult; Job (Robby Kiger) and his psychic-drawing sister Sarah (Anne Marie McEvoy). Together, the four of them work up a plan to escape from the horrible corn cult members and find a way to banish the evil deity from the cornfield. Can you say, ""burning stubble?"" But it won't be easy. Isaac's preaching easily contaminates the minds of those around him, and Malachai's thirst for slashing and blood dominates his every waking hour. It's a powerfully evil combination that makes a cult of kids a true hellish nightmare.Personally, I thought the overall acting was mediocre at best when I first viewed ""Children Of The Corn."" After seeing it a few times more since, I've narrowed it down to two people. Linda Hamilton's acting as Vicky can be downright annoying with her persistent ""Can we leave now?"" ""I don't think this is a road,"" and ""Just tell me where we are."" And that birthday song she sings for Burton at the start of the movie makes me grit my teeth with pain. Her acting could have been a lot better if she put a bit more feeling into her lines. It just seemed flat to me somehow. I didn't think Peter Horton as Burton was too bad, although his mocking of the religious speeches on his car radio was less than amusing. His acting was a little flat at times too, but not as bad as Hamilton's. He has an earnestness about him during the more intense scenes when he's confronting the cult of kids, trying to get Sarah to talk to him, and working with Job to cast away the evil deity. It comes across as fairly genuine and he actually sucked me into his character. John Franklin was incredible as Isaac! His eyes are dark and evil and he can do a mean twisted smirk. When he preaches, he puts that umph behind every word; demanding.....earnest.....insistent.....just like a true fire and brimstone preacher desperately trying to get his point across. Courtney Gains as Malachai was probably my favorite though. That guy was just downright disturbing with his evil, narrowed eyes, devilish grin and warped scowl. His voice is seething, intense and loud, as if stretching every vocal chord in his throat. The sight of him with a blade was unnerving. The little kids, Job and Sarah were fairly well cast. They really capture the youth and innocence, not to mention normality that used to be in Gatlin, and really help contrast this with the evil that they are surrounded by. This bipolar tension makes the movie good.The music fits this film so well. During attacks that are about to reach a climax, we hear a loud church-choir like group speak/sing in melodic, intense religious chants. It is absolutely awesome! And again there is the sweet tension there; the religious chants, which are supposed to be good, being sung while evil is being done. The main title theme features high haunting vocals from youth; no words, just notes. It really captures the intensity of the film that much more.I guess I should get to my favorite scene, huh? Well, I actually have two. I'm a fan of horror, so I like intensity. Two of the most intense scenes come in the first part of the film when the cult slaughters the adults in the caf&eacute; and when Malachai sends Joseph to his maker while he's trying to escape. The attack wounds look pretty real and the makeup is very well done. The props are great too; all the cornhusks and evil drawings in the stores, and I also need to mention that dusty town of tumbleweeds, corn fields, old farms and empty rat infested stores. The feeling of isolation in a sleepy town with nothing but evil to come get you, just screams at you. Included in this film is also the original theatrical trailer. Nothing major, but still a kick to watch, and the narrator of it has a voice made for horror.Well, I think I've said all I need to say about ""Children Of The Corn."" Whether you want a fairly disturbing scare, a nostalgic trip back to the 80's horror days, or just a plain old horror film for Halloween, grab up 1984's ""Children Of The Corn.""",3,"""You're not

329457,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6302720419,Jeffrey Leach,"[3, 4]","No other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as Stephen King. For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. ""Carrie"" is probably the best example, followed by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Dead Zone."" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.""Children of the Corn,"" hammered together from a King short story, introduces us to freshly minted physician Burt (Peter Horton) and his significant other Vicky (Linda Hamilton) as they are driving across the country to Burt's first post-medical school stint. The arduous journey begins to takes its toll on the two as they wander through the Midwest, specifically Nebraska. Nothing but open skies, cornfields, and ranting preachers on the airwaves are around to keep Burt and Vicky entertained, and that doesn't last too long. There is also some tension between the two concerning their relationship, with Burt suffering from the predictable ""guy scared to make a commitment"" mentality we've seen in nearly every film made since the beginning of the twentieth century. These problems soon take a backseat, however, when Burt accidentally plows his car into a boy standing in the middle of the road. A cursory examination of the body reveals a shocking revelation: instead of perishing as a result of the car accident, someone slashed this kid's throat moments before the couple came along. Burt searches the cornfield a few yards off the highway and finds a suitcase spattered with blood, further evidence that something quite grim is afoot. The city slickers resolve to head to the nearest town, Gatlin, to report the apparent murder.They soon discover that finding Gatlin is about as easy as finding El Dorado. Signs pointing the way to the town seem to contradict one another. Even the tentative help they get from a crusty old gas station attendant, who also tells them to avoid the town in a way that evokes memories of Crazy Ralph from ""Friday the 13th,"" doesn't initially help them. Nonetheless, Burt and Vicky soon roll into what looks like a ghost town. Cornhusks adorn the buildings and blow through the streets like tumbleweeds. The stores are decrepit, refuse filled shells. Even the courthouse looks like a neutron bomb went off inside. Only when Burt and Vicky stumble over two kids playing a board game in an abandoned house, Job (Robby Kiger) and Sarah (AnnMarie McEvoy), do they begin to understand the horror residing in Gatlin, Nebraska. We the audience learned long before what happened, and what continues to happen, in this strange place. Some years before the children in the town fell under the influence of youthful preacher named Isaac (John Franklin), a scary looking kid who ordered his adherents to murder every adult in town because ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" commanded such an action. With the help of his beefy henchman Malachai (Courtney Gains), Isaac continues to perform bizarre rituals that allow him to keep the others in line. Obviously, Burt and Vicky must challenge his authority, and the legitimacy of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows,"" if they wish to survive.The first film, you will hear stalwarts say over and over again, isn't that bad of a movie. In fact, a few of them will look you straight in the eyes and say ""Children of the Corn"" is not only one of the best horror films out there, it is also one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations ever to grace the silver screen. These are the individuals who will one day find employment as circus barkers, car salesmen, or politicians. ""Children of the Corn"" starts out with lots of promise, about a minute's worth, which gives these apologists' opinions an initial veneer of respectability. After Vicky sings that song to Burt at the hotel room, the movie starts its long decline into banality. The road scenes run on forever, the presence of the elderly gas station attendant is a horror film clich&eacute;, and we never see the demonic force stalking through the cornfields. Worse, there is little gore and the special effects, particularly during the final showdown between the outsiders and the demon, attain the heights of laughable cheesiness. The only bright spots in the film are Isaac and Malachai, in large part due to their sneering visages and the biblical mumbo jumbo they spout every time they appear onscreen.I just learned Anchor Bay released a Special Edition disc of ""Children of the Corn"" complete with a commentary track and featurette. The version I watched--the ""unspecial"" edition, perhaps?--contained only the film and a trailer. As boring as the picture is, I'm still going to give it three stars because several of the sequels that follow it make this one look like ""Citizen Kane."" Give it a watch if you must, but be prepared for a big disappointment.",3,Poorly executed King adaptation,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,5730,"['other', 'author', 'recent', 'memory', 'had', 'much',

As we drive past the fields, we see nothing but green with the occasional rooftop or silo in the distance.  What goes on deep in the fields?  Who is out there?  What is out there?  Is that person or thing religious?This is classic horror.  The movie takes not just things we have looked out before, but things we have never really seen.  We hear religious fundamentalist all the time on the TV and radio.  We see corn fields often enough.  But we never really think much about them.  This story jumps into the imagination and makes the ordinary terrifying.  This is a good story.The movie takes the farm country and religious fundamentalism and wraps them together with a twist.  A child, Isaac, gets visions, which tell him to create a new religion, killing all the adults.  Further, no adults shall be suffered to live.  His religion has some fundamentalist undertones, but also some bizarre rituals and ideas.  Oddly enough, this movie doesn't actually insult religion, but seems to ask the question, ""What if what they said was real?""By no means is this movie worthy of an Oscar, but this movie was never intended to be.  It was meant to thrill you a bit by showing you a slight twist to reality by playing with something we see every day.

329459,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,6302720419,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[1, 1]","Following in the tradition of such Stephen King movies as ""The Shining"", this move uses psychological terror with blood and gore to scare viewers.The movie takes place in Gatlin, Nebraska. A young couple, Burton (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton), are travelling through rural America.  Burton has just graduated from medical school and is on his way to his first internship.  However, the pair end up getting lost and accidentally run over a person who has emerged from one of the fields alongside the road.  Unsure of what to do, Burton places the body in his trunk.  Eventually, Burton and Vicky decide that they need help and begin looking in Gatlin.They soon realize there are no adults in Gatlin; only children.  The children have brutally murdered all of the adults and started a cult which worships the corn and someone known as ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"".  The cult is led by Isaac (John Franklin) and Malachai (Courtney Gains).  After watching, the viewer learns that the true presence is not IN the corn, but UNDER it.  Burton and Vicky must get out of Gatlin at all costs or die at the hands of Isaac, Malachai, and the other cult members.I thought this was a good movie, but not as scary as I had hoped.  Some parts, such as the scenes of the thing running through the fields undergound was scary, but there was little else.  Isaac's and Malachai's struggle for control over the cult was thrilling to see, but I thought Horton and Hamilton gave only average performances.  John Franklin, however, was very good as the man-child Isaac, while Gains' portrayal as Isaac's right-hand man and eventual antagonist Malachai was equally good. The many unanswered questions, such as what ever happened to the body in the trunk, and what is the thing under the rows of corn, are frustrating.I recommend this movie, but I do feel that it could have been better.  However, the psychological suspense of not knowing what was going to happen next was evident in the movie.  The producers must have done something right, because there were several sequels made to this movie.  I've been a fan of Stephen King movies for years, but I wish this one would have been a little better.",3,Another Creepy Stephen King Movie,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,2188,"['Following', 'tradition', 'such', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movies', 'Shining', 'move', 'psychological', 'terror', 'blood', 'gore', 'scare', 'viewers.The', 'movie', 'place', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'A', 'young', 'couple', 'Burton', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'Vicky', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'are', 'travelling', 'rural', 'America', 'Burton', 'just', 'graduated', 'medical', 'school', 'way', 'first', 'internship', 'However', 'pair', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'lost', 'accidentally', 'run', 'over', 'person', 'who', 'emerged', 'one', 'fields', 'road', 'Unsure', 'what', 'do', 'Burton', 'body', 'trunk', 'Eventually', 'Burton', 'Vicky', 'decide', 'need', 'help', 'begin', 'looking', 'Gatlin.They', 'soon', 'realize', 'are', 'adults', 'Gatlin', 'only', 'children', 'children', 'have', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'adults', 'started', 'cult', 'corn', 'someone', 'known', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'cult', 'led', 'Isaac', 'John', 'Franklin', 'Malachai', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'watching', 'viewer', 'true', 'presence', 'not', 'IN', 'corn', 'Burton', 'Vicky', 'must', 'get', 'Gatlin', 'costs', 'die', 'hands', 'Isaac', 'Malachai', 'other', 'cult', 'members.I', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'scary', 'had', 'hoped', 'parts', 'such', 'scenes', 'thing', 'running', 'fields', 'undergound', 'was', 'scary', 'was', 'little', 'else', 'Isaac', 'Malachai', 'struggle', 'control', 'cult', 'was', 'thrilling', 'see', 'thought', 'Horton', 'Hamilton', 'gave', 'only', 'average', 'performances', 'John', 'Franklin', 'however', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'man-child', 'Isaac', 'Gains', 'portrayal', 'Isaac', 'right-hand', 'man', 'eventual', 'antagonist', 'Malachai', 'was', 'equally', 'good', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'such', 'what', 'ever', 'happened', 'body', 'trunk', 'what', 'thing', 'rows', 'corn', 'are', 'frustrating.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'do', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'However', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'was', 'evident', 'movie', 'producers', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'right', 'were', 'several', 'sequels', 'made', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movies', 'years', 'wish', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better']",Children of the Corn VHS

Nearly everything that Stephen King has ever written seems to have been turned into a film or TV series; in fact, I'm surprised that no one has tried to make a mini-series from the guy's grocery list. Let's face it, if they did, it couldn't be any less interesting than 'Children of the Corn.'Based on one of King's many short stories, this 1984 horror flick sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton playing a couple on a long car journey who run into a spot of bother when they chance upon the sleepy Nebraska town of Gatlin, where all of the adults have been murdered by children who worship an ancient evil that lurks in the corn fields.Although director Fritz Kiersch does manage to build a fair amount of atmosphere at the beginning (after Hamilton's silly song and dance, but before we get to meet the freakish Isaac, leader of the killer kids), he completely blows it with endless unexciting scenes in which Hamilton and Horton are hunted down by the town's homicidal half-pints. Courtney Gains, as violent redhead Malachai, manages to appear genuinely menacing, but the rest of the children are not the least bit threatening; as a result, many of the film's 'scary' moments fail to work.Towards the end of the film, when we finally get to see the malevolent force that inhabits the field surrounding Gatlin, the film descends into a glut of terrible 80s visual effects that probably looked pretty ropey almost 25 years ago, but look positively laughable nowadays.'Children of the Corn' might be of interest to King fans keen to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen, but your average horror-film fan will be most unimpressed.",3,It's only consider a Classic because it's one of Stephen Kings earlier works.....,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,1731,"['had', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'like', 'manage', 'get', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'Stephen', 'King', 'ever', 'written', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'film', 'TV', 'series', 'fact', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'one', 'tried', 'make', 'mini-series', 'guy', 'grocery', 'list', 'Let', 'face', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'less', 'interesting', ""'Children"", 'Corn', ""'Based"", 'one', 'King', 'many', 'short', 'stories', '1984', 'horror', 'flick', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'playing', 'couple', 'long', 'car', 'journey', 'who', 'run', 'spot', 'bother', 'when', 'chance', 'sleepy', 'Nebraska', 'town', 'Gatlin', 'where', 'adults', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'children', 'who', 'worship', 'ancient', 'evil', 'corn', 'director', 'Fritz', 'Kiersch', 'manage', 'build', 'fair', 'amount', 'atmosphere', 'beginning', 'Hamilton', 'silly', 'song', 'dance', 'get', 'meet', 'freakish', 'Isaac', 'leader', 'killer', 'kids', 'completely', 'endless', 'unexciting', 'scenes', 'Hamilton', 'Horton', 'are', 'hunted', 'down', 'town', 'homicidal', 'half-pints', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'violent', 'redhead', 'Malachai', 'appear', 'genuinely', 'menacing', 'rest', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'threatening', 'result', 'many', 'film', ""'scary"", 'moments', 'fail', 'work.Towards', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'malevolent', 'force', 'field', 'surrounding', 'Gatlin', 'film', 'glut', 'terrible', '80s', 'visual', 'effects', 'probably', 'looked', 'pretty', 'ropey', 'almost', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'look', 'positively', 'laughable', 'nowadays', ""'Children"", 'Corn', 'might', 'be', 'interest', 'King', 'fans', 'keen', 'see', 'how', 'writer', 'work', 'been', 'translated', 'big', 'screen', 'average', 'horror-film', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'unimpressed']",Children of the Corn VHS

I can understand the difficulty in translating King's superlative prose into a feature film, but why must the acting be so bad.

I'll give you an example: in King's writing, the great creature at the end (He Who Walks Behind the Rows) is a genuinely frightening entity (I won't give away too much). However, in the film, this beast is portrayed as a stupid, hokey &quot;force&quot; (probably due to budget restrictions)...

I guess it plays on the same kind of fears that movies that have bee's taking over the world do. We treat children like they're a nusance, so they rise up against their aggressors, adults, and most likely succeed because adults discredit kids. Huh......Well that's at least what I got from this movie.When I watch a horror movie I look for three basic things. First, is the acting up to par and is the movie well made? Second, how are the special effects and the death sequences? Finally, does the end of the movie deliever and wrap things up?In the first category this movie does really well. You can tell from the beginning that the movie was probably made on a very small budget, but the camera work, and everything else was done extremely well. The acting is also pretty good for such a low budget movie. Terminator girl does a terrific job, as well as all of the kids, especially the leader. Malaki, or the red-headed bully stumbles over his lines, but he does a half decent job. So yeah, the movie delievers here.* Oh, something to watch for. When the main character is running away from the children who are chasing him, and calling him lap lander, or excuse me OUT-lander, he runs into the barn. It is dark in the barn and he ""hits"" his head on a beam. It's incredibly hilarious because you can sooooo tell, he fakes it.Secondly, does the movie have decent special effects and death sequences? Yes and no. Yes because some of the special effects are pretty good, but there isn't that many of them, nor killing sequences. The kids go on a rampage in the beginning and then, that's pretty much it. There is a lot of suspense in the movie, which does creep you out, but no real need for crazy special effects. The special effects are okay. At the end they look pretty cheesy, but hey low-budget movie so what are you going to do?Finally does the ending wrap the movie up? This movie certainly does. It takes all the elements of the story and wraps them up into a neat pacakage at the end. Like I said, the special effects are a little cheesy but alright. It's nothing you can't see coming, but it has some little twists which keep you watching.So all in all, this is a pretty good movie. It's gotten a bad wrap for some reason, but there will always be a book versus movie battle for every book they turn into a movie. I never have read the book, so I can't throw my two cents in here.

I remembered the premise and general plot but hadn't watched it in decades. My wife and I decided to buy it just to watch a spook movie.  Honestly, it was ok. Most of Stephen King's movies are just so-so compared to the books. While I have read a ton of King's books and am a fan for sure, I had never read this one so I can't speak to whether it was as good as the flick itself.  I do know that the casting was fine, the small town creepy atmosphere is palpable, and that kid they cast to play Isaac the little ""prophet,"" John Franklin, CUUUREEPY!  That kid is so bizarre-looking, just creepy! And the Malachi character is a weasle, too!I thought the movie moved along too fast and came to a head too quickly. It became predictable.And what seemed unrealistic to me is how an entire town of kids could keep the town a secret for three years!! Hello? No Pepsi trucks, gasoline trucks, produce trucks, or other goods ever come into that town?  How about the mayor's office and the State of Nebraska?

It is of this film's climax, giant fields of corn, some sort of malevolent creature burrowing through the ground like a mole on coke, and crosses of corn exploding into the air.  I only saw fragments because my parents were watching the film, but at the time, it freaked me out.This is probably because my father is a Baptist minister, lending all sorts of sobriety to the image of crosses, and also because I grew up in southeast Missouri, around dozens and dozens of cornfields.I wanted to be scared like that again, so I got theChildrenoftheCornseries.  Instead of being scared, however, I have been afforded the opportunity to warn others of my mistake.In the first five minutes of this film, all the children of the podunk town of Gatlin, Nebraska kill every last citizen over the age of 19.  That's the first five minutes, mind you.  The entire incident is narrated nonchalantly by young Job (Robby Kiger), who is annoyed that his mother and father have been slain, but who isn't necessarily put out by the ordeal.Because, you see, Job and his sister Sarah (who, for no reason whatsoever, can draw the future), are kept alive by the band of murderous children, who are acting at the behest of Issac, a legitimately creepy child who is acting as the prophet of He Who Walks Behind the Rows (of corn).  Issac is played by John Franklin, a twenty-five year old whose Growth Hormone Disorder makes him seem just the right kind of disturbing for the part.  After murdering all of the adults, the town of Gatlin enters a three-year grace period, where, for some reason, absolutely no investigation or inquiry is made into the town's sudden lack of taxpayers.  What, the relatives of these murdered adults don't worry that their family doesn't respond to mail or phone calls?  How is that this place still gets electricity, gas, and water after all of the breadwinners have been dispatched?  Ah, but I'm thinking too much.  Ha ha.  Silly me.Anyway, enter Burt (a laconic Peter Horton) and Vicky (a younger, sexier Linda Hamilton), two thirty-somethings entering the picture purely by accident when they happen to collide with Issac's latest victim, a young defector whose name I don't care to look up.King has always taken issue with fundamentalism, and his work reflects that.  I can't testify to how true this film is to the short story that inspired it, but that fanatical religious fervor is present here in undiluted form.  Who knows what these kids are worshipping?  Not even them it seems.  Whatever it is, it enjoys bloodshed and corn, and it hates adults (if you define adult as 20+ years of age).Aside from the story's basic incomprehensibility, the movie is uneventful and horribly acted.  It's a rough deal when the bulk of your cast is children, especially when said children are directed to act menacing.  The most violent child of all, Malachai (Courtney Gains), tries to leer and sneer with the best of them, but mostly what I noticed was his abnormally large mouth.  He screams a bit, Issac screams a bit, Burt takes it all in stride, and a kid named Amos gets a pentagram carved into his chestIt's all rather mundane and dull.  In fact, I think the movie glossed over the scariest part.  What I would've liked to have seen is the preface to all of this weirdness.  Instead of making a movie about the aftermath, they should've written a story about Issac discovering He Who Walks Behind the Rows, about him convincing an entire town of children to murder their parents.  That's what I thought the movie was about, actually (instead of it being the first five minutes).  And the sequels that followed?  Well, I assumed they would be about people coming to investigate why no one in Gatlin returns phone calls or has paid their credit card bills.  Now, I don't know what to expect.Probably more corn.",2,Childish and Corny,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,3872,"['have', 'glimpse', 'memory', 'when', 'was', 'ten', 'so', 'film', 'climax', 'giant', 'fields', 'corn', 'sort', 'malevolent', 'creature', 'burrowing', 'ground', 'mole', 'coke', 'crosses', 'corn', 'exploding', 'air', 'only', 'saw', 'fragments', 'parents', 'were', 'watching', 'film', 'time', 'freaked', 'out.This', 'probably', 'father', 'Baptist', 'minister', 'lending', 'sorts', 'sobriety', 'image', 'crosses', 'also', 'grew', 'up', 'southeast', 'Missouri', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'cornfields.I', 'wanted', 'be', 'scared', 'again', 'got', 'theChildrenoftheCornseries', 'Instead', 'being', 'scared', 'however', 'have', 'been', 'afforded', 'opportunity', 'warn', 'others', 'mistake.In', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'children', 'podunk', 'town', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'kill', 'last', 'citizen', 'age', '19', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'mind', 'entire', 'incident', 'narrated', 'nonchalantly', 'young', 'Job', 'Robby', 'Kiger', 'who', 'annoyed', 'mother', 'father', 'have', 'been', 'slain', 'who', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'put', 'out', 'ordeal.Because', 'see', 'Job', 'sister', 'Sarah', 'who', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'can', 'draw', 'future', 'are', 'kept', 'alive', 'band', 'murderous', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'acting', 'behest', 'Issac', 'legitimately', 'creepy', 'child', 'who', 'acting', 'prophet', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'corn', 'Issac', 'played', 'John', 'Franklin', 'twenty-five', 'year', 'old', 'Growth', 'Hormone', 'Disorder', 'seem', 'just', 'right', 'kind', 'disturbing', 'part', 'murdering', 'adults', 'town', 'Gatlin', 'three-year', 'grace', 'period', 'where', 'reason', 'absolutely', 'investigation', 'inquiry', 'made', 'town', 'sudden', 'lack', 'taxpayers', 'What', 'relatives', 'murdered', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'family', ""n't"", 'respond', 'mail', 'phone', 'calls', 'How', 'place', 'still', 'electricity', 'gas', 'water', 'breadwinners', 'have', 'been', 'dispatched', 'Ah', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'too', 'much', 'Ha', 'ha', 'Silly', 'me.Anyway', 'enter', 'Burt', 'laconic', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'Vicky', 'younger', 'sexier', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'two', 'thirty-somethings', 'entering', 'picture', 'purely', 'accident', 'when', 'happen', 'collide', 'Issac', 'latest', 'victim', 'young', 'defector', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'look', 'up.King', 'always', 'taken', 'issue', 'fundamentalism', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'testify', 'how', 'true', 'film', 'short', 'story', 'inspired', 'fanatical', 'religious', 'fervor', 'present', 'here', 'undiluted', 'form', 'Who', 'what', 'kids', 'are', 'worshipping', 'Not', 'even', 'Whatever', 'bloodshed', 'corn', 'adults', 'define', 'adult', '20+', 'years', 'age', '.Aside', 'story', 'basic', 'incomprehensibility', 'movie', 'uneventful', 'horribly', 'acted', 'rough', 'deal', 'when', 'bulk', 'cast', 'children', 'especially', 'when', 'said', 'children', 'are', 'directed', 'act', 'menacing', 'most', 'violent', 'child', 'Malachai', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'leer', 'sneer', 'best', 'mostly', 'what', 'noticed', 'was', 'abnormally', 'large', 'mouth', 'bit', 'Issac', 'bit', 'Burt', 'stride', 'kid', 'named', 'Amos', 'pentagram', 'carved', 'chestIt', 'rather', 'mundane', 'dull', 'fact', 'think', 'movie', 'glossed', 'scariest', 'part', 'What', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'preface', 'weirdness', 'Instead', 'making', 'movie', 'aftermath', 'should', ""'ve"", 'written', 'story', 'Issac', 'discovering', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'convincing', 'entire', 'town', 'children', 'murder', 'parents', 'what', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'actually', 'instead', 'being', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'sequels', 'followed', 'Well', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'people', 'coming', 'investigate', 'why', 'one', 'Gatlin', 'returns', 'phone', 'paid', 'credit', 'card', 'bills', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect.Probably', 'more', 'corn']",Children of the Corn VHS

329489,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6302720419,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","This movie, based on the short story of the same name in Stephen King's night shift collection, takes on an interesting, creepy, original idea and squashes it like a mushy corn cake.The film begins with promise, little evil kids peeking into the windows of a diner as other sadistic brats slaughter the adults inside. So yeah, the movie starts out with a bang but runs out of fuel way too fast. The main stars Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton and pre-Terminator Linda Hamilton) are the focal point while they're finding dead kids, weird distorted bibles, church meetings and parting corn fields. They are interesting enough characters but can't save this film from becoming just another video lining the store shelves.A main issue is some of the annoying child actors. Malachai (Courtney Gains) acts well but has one of the biggest mouths I have ever seen (literally). You should see the size of this thing we he opens it wide and really goes to town with his Shakespearean speaking. And all of the combined dialogue of he and his partner in crime, John Franklin (Isaac), is atrocious. Two unforgivable sins: boring pace and too much chitchat the audience couldn't care less about.Some of the slayings are cool enough but seem almost an afterthought to the constant preaching. Toss this up with a silly finale and it wraps up to be field fertilizer. I always love weird cult premises, they can be dark and morbid, but this one has the kids too melodramatic and doesn't delve deep enough into the story itself.Another bad idea the creator's had was how the ended was executed. The story by itself before they started showing cheap effects in a cheesy wrap-up was slightly chilling simply because it could really happen. For the most part of the movie I saw the other children as brainwashed by two crazed older leaders. But the films ending blows any creepiness all to hell and takes on the job in the most laughable way possible. Rolling earth?? Brrrr....Despite all these faults and being boring for the most part, the movie has some decent parts and is worth watching at least once for curiosity's sake.

Linda Hamilton & Peter Horton are reliable as the adult leads, and I'm usually appalled by bad kid-actors, but there are so many of them that I had a good time. One kid actor, Anne-Marie McEvoy (as Sarah) was believable.  This film starts out well, and really grabs you; after a while, the kids appear and make it a crazy exposition of silliness. The bland setting of Nebraska (actually, filmed in Iowa) adds to the initial interest. Credit must be given to director Fritz Kiersch for his great use of sets and creating a certain tension, and the music of Jonathan Elias (reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmith's THE OMEN) was effective. Still, there's no forgiving the performances of John Franklin (Isaac) and Courtney Gains (Malachi, who looks like a cross between Alfalfa & Eddie Haskell). They were so atrocious, but, mixed with all the other horrible kid-performances, it becomes a laff-fest. One kid, Amos (John Philbin), looks like a young Tom Cruise, and goes to his death with a toothy smile that's borderline corny (forgive the pun). The film is entertaining, as long as you don't take it seriously. It is based on a 15-page Stephen King story, but it kind of takes on a mystique of its own.

It is his birthday, and they are both going to a new town because Horton has the job of a doctor. So they hit the road, and then hit a kid on the road, and more to their horror, he was already dead because the man notices his through severely cut out.So then we find out all kids in the town killed every adult in the town, because they are in in some sort of a cult that gathers in the towns cornfields. Well, the only two normal people are these two kids. Their older borther was the one hit by the car. So they pretty much help the ouple defeat the god that all the kids worship, and happy ending.I liked this film just because to 80s feel, the atmosphere really reminded me of Amish descent, and this had some great special effects and great gore/makeup scenes.

329501,A26WVK274IA7DN,6302720419,Sarah Bellum,"[5, 7]","""Children of the Corn"" had some potential: a ""corn"" cult for children with a charismatic adolescent as its leader takes over a rural town in Nebraska. Based on a short story by Stephen King, this is a fairly interesting and unusual concept. Unfortunately, some very weak execution is what mars the movie. Its director, Fritz Kiersch, sometimes works as ""Alan Smithee,"" the pseudonym for directors who don't want to attach their real names to movies they know are turkeys. This movie doesn't quite warrant that, though it isn't very good either. There is scarcely anything more pathetic than a movie that claims to be frightening, yet simply is not. Most egregious is the use of hokey, faux sacred music. Aside from Linda Hamilton, John Franklin and Robbie Kiger, the performances are pretty weak. It doesn't help that some of the dialogue is laughably bad and that some of the special effects are cheap and look awful. Isaac Chroner (Franklin) instructs the children of the town to murder all but one adult, who is apparently needed to warn potential visitors against entering the town. His advice nearly prevents Vicky and Burt Stanton from seeking medical help there, but darker forces prevail and the couple finds itself fending off attacks from the kids. If the excessively dramatic acting and cheesy effects at the climax do not make you laugh, the incredibly lame final scene certainly will. That is not to say this movie is all bad, however. Though never scary, there are a few effective moments throughout. (I don't want to reveal any of them because they would be the only reasons for watching the movie)  Die hard horror fans might want to check out this 1984 release, though fans of good movies will probably want to steer clear.

Following in the tradition of ""The Bad Seed"" and ""Village of the Damned,"" ""Children of the Corn"" sets out to shatter our notion that childhood is a time of innocence.  The opening scene grabs us right away.  In Gatlin, Nebraska, a small farming community, the good citizens follow church on Sunday with breakfast at the local coffee shop.  One morning, however, the town's children rise up against the adults, poisoning their coffee and slashing their throats in a violent, horrifying sequence.  Skip ahead three years.  Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton, Linda Hamilton) have a bad accident outside Gatlin and walk to town, searching for help.  But they find no adults.  Eventually, they discover that the children of Gatlin have formed a religious cult around an evil entity, ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows.""  Though far from a classic, this film has an enormous following and has inspired six sequels, five released directly to DVD.  Its appeal lies partly in the performances of the two young leads.  John Franklin plays Isaac, the nine-year-old prophet who organized the cult, and Courtney Gains portrays the odd-looking and unsettling Malachai.  Bonus extras include the featurette, ""Welcome to Gatlin: The Sight and Sounds of Children Of the Corn;"" an interview with Linda Hamilton; audio commentary by director Fritz Kiersch and actors John Franklin and Courtney Gains; and the documentary ""Harvesting Horror: Children of the Corn.""",4,Horror in the Cornfields,1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,1540,"['Children', 'Corn', '1984', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'tale', 'children', 'monsters', 'Following', 'tradition', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'Village', 'Damned', 'Children', 'Corn', 'out', 'shatter', 'notion', 'childhood', 'time', 'innocence', 'opening', 'scene', 'grabs', 'right', 'away', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'small', 'farming', 'community', 'good', 'citizens', 'follow', 'church', 'Sunday', 'breakfast', 'local', 'coffee', 'shop', 'One', 'morning', 'however', 'town', 'children', 'rise', 'up', 'adults', 'poisoning', 'coffee', 'slashing', 'throats', 'violent', 'horrifying', 'sequence', 'Skip', 'ahead', 'three', 'years', 'Burt', 'Vicky', 'Peter', 'Horton', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'have', 'bad', 'accident', 'Gatlin', 'walk', 'town', 'searching', 'help', 'find', 'adults', 'Eventually', 'discover', 'children', 'Gatlin', 'have', 'formed', 'religious', 'cult', 'evil', 'entity', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'far', 'classic', 'film', 'enormous', 'following', 'inspired', 'six', 'sequels', 'five', 'released', 'directly', 'DVD', 'appeal', 'partly', 'performances', 'two', 'young', 'leads', 'John', 'Franklin', 'Isaac', 'nine-year-old', 'prophet', 'who', 'organized', 'cult', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'odd-looking', 'unsettling', 'Malachai', 'Bonus', 'include', 'featurette', 'Welcome', 'Gatlin', 'Sight', 'Sounds', 'Children', 'Corn', 'interview', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Fritz', 'Kiersch', 'actors', 'John', 'Franklin', 'Courtney', 'Gains', 'documentary', 'Harvesting', 'Horror', 'Children', 'Corn']",Children of the Corn VHS

I remember when I was 11 or 12 and this movie was on TV, right in the beginning in the coffee house massacre scene. I remember being so frightened I had to switch channels! Being older, I can say that the movie's not as terrifying now, but ""Children of the Corn"" still has an eerie atmosphere that entices you all the way through.If you can get past what may seem silly aspects that climax towards then end and enjoy the movie nonetheless, then ""Children of the Corn"" will definitely be a great watch. It's one of those '80s classics that's still just as entertaining, eerie, mystical and captivating now as it was in its own time. The setting in the abandoned, little Midwestern town is the perfect setting for this sort of movie, so that beefs up the quality of the film right there. In addition, the acting is quite good, and Isaac is one of the most sinister little punks I've ever seen on screen! Malachai too, plays an awesome villain, but whereas Isaac plays the darker, more evil villain, Malachai plays the more nuts-out, kick-a## sort of villain. The two of them work great together and lead the evil flock of children...gahh, it's starting to take its effect on me again!Although ""Children of the Corn"" doesn't really have the humorous breaks in it that a lot of other horror movies do, it's certainly a great and enjoyable movie, that's most likely to captivate you with its dark, mysterious atmosphere.

Well, what has always struck me is how well the children are adapted to the surroundings. I actually BELIEVE that these children lived in Gatlin ""before"" the filming of the movie. They seem very at home and the small town feel is somehow legitimate. The sound is very good for an older flick, being given the 5.1 treatment, and the score itself is practially worth seeing the movie for... I just love that chanting ""Omen-ish"" score, always have. The transfer I'd say is above average, though in places it falters a bit, there is also a handsome insert book that comes with it which is unusual for a rather lowbudget movie. I really like all the leads here, specifically the look on young Sarah's face when ""Vickie"" is taken out to the clearing, she honestly looks to be in fear, I almost feel sorry for the young actress.What's to hate? Well, aside from the odd smalltown feel there really aren't many chills from a horror movie standpoint. Also, I've never really liked the end, often turning it off b4 the poor CG ending, but hey, this is '84 afterall.If you have a few dollars and are looking for a somewhat surreal look at small town life, you could do worse than giving Children Of The Corn a look.",4,It happened everywhere in Gatlin that day...,1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,1314,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', ""'84"", 'have', 'had', 'strange', 'connection', 'ever', 'since.What', 'like', 'Well', 'what', 'always', 'struck', 'how', 'well', 'children', 'are', 'adapted', 'surroundings', 'actually', 'BELIEVE', 'children', 'lived', 'Gatlin', 'filming', 'movie', 'seem', 'very', 'home', 'small', 'town', 'feel', 'somehow', 'legitimate', 'sound', 'very', 'good', 'older', 'flick', 'being', 'given', '5.1', 'treatment', 'score', 'practially', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie', 'just', 'love', 'chanting', 'Omen-ish', 'score', 'always', 'have', 'transfer', ""'d"", 'say', 'above', 'average', 'places', 'bit', 'also', 'handsome', 'insert', 'book', 'unusual', 'rather', 'lowbudget', 'movie', 'really', 'leads', 'here', 'specifically', 'look', 'young', 'Sarah', 'face', 'when', 'Vickie', 'taken', 'out', 'clearing', 'honestly', 'be', 'fear', 'almost', 'feel', 'sorry', 'young', 'actress.What', 'hate', 'Well', 'aside', 'odd', 'smalltown', 'feel', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'chills', 'horror', 'movie', 'standpoint', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'end', 'often', 'turning', 'off', 'poor', 'CG', 'ending', 'hey', ""'84"", 'have', 'few', 'dollars', 'are', 'looking', 'somewhat', 'surreal', 'look', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'giving', 'Children', 'Corn', 'look']",Children of the Corn VHS

Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 4]","Like the majority of adapted Stephen King stories, this 80's horror flick falls short of the source material, although it's pretty cool to actually see the source material on the screen. (Literally, a paperback copy of Night Shift is on the dashboard in front of Linda Hamilton in the opening driving sequence).The original story is only 30 pages long and a little different from the movie, but again, like the majority of King's work, it just doesn't transfer directly to the screen. The story is slightly modified, but not terribly so. One day the children in a small town decide to rise up and kill all the adults in the town in order to worship HE WHO WALKS BEHIND THE ROWS. This plot-line goes back to one of King's semi-obsessions: the idea that there are small towns out there so remote that no one would even notice when an entire town is massacred and deserted... that is, until a pair of unsuspecting travelers happen upon it.Rating this movie based on special-effects and film quality standards of today would hardly be fair, and I have a feeling that for the 80's this was a quality film, but obviously, today the climactic scenes, and some stuff leading up to that are pretty ""corny""... I knew I'd have to say that.I haven't seen any of the sequels, and I suspect they're not that great, but this film is worth the time to watch if you're into horror movies.
