1578823,AFDWSRBS7SRCB,B008YRL79O,J. S. Bell,"[0, 1]","... but what is it about the directors of some of these more explicitly faith-based movies? I am a Christian.  I believe in the premise of the movie, which I take to be that modern tech culture has harmed how families work, has made us too dependent on our toys, and perhaps we need to back away from all that tech and learn how to be human again, especially with those we say we love. I get that.But for some reason, you can really tell the difference between a movie with so-so direction that is slipping into preachy-ness, versus a first class adventure or comedy or romance that is so engaging it never once lets you realize you're watching a movie, let alone get preachy.  That to me, is the measure of a good movie.  You never see actors, sets, special effects, etc.  Instead, you have an experience. You suspend your disbelief from the first to the last.  There is never a lapse. And if there is some great truth to learn, it's woven perfectly, seamlessly into the fabric of the story itself.This movie falls short of that standard. The plot is simple. A dysfunctional family is growing more and more disconnected until the dad realizes his survivalist elder brother may have a solution: pretend for three days that the modern world as you know it has been blown away and it's just you and your family, all alone, trying to survive, and finally coming together as a team.But there comes a point in the story where, for me at least, I fell out of the movie and into the &#34;what are they doing&#34; zone? It happens when they have to chop up a piece of furniture for firewood. Everybody knows they're just pretending. In our house, the wife is not going to just let me chop up some old piece of furniture for a game. They didn't build any motivation into it. I couldn't see it happening, not even in the universe created by the story.  It wasn't real. I started seeing the actors as just people reading a script uncritically. They weren't really there, in the story, either. So why should I be?From that point forward it became work to finish watching it.Others may enjoy it more than I did, and it was a movie where you didn't have to worry about anything happening that might bother your four year old. Well, except perhaps for that one scene with the angry doll.  THAT was creepy, and one of the better moments in the movie. But other than that, harmless fun. Though I think it could have been a great deal more fun with top notch direction.",3,"This movie is watchable, and makes some good points ...",1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,2451,"['what', 'directors', 'more', 'explicitly', 'faith-based', 'movies', 'am', 'Christian', 'believe', 'premise', 'movie', 'take', 'be', 'modern', 'tech', 'culture', 'harmed', 'how', 'families', 'work', 'made', 'too', 'dependent', 'toys', 'perhaps', 'need', 'back', 'away', 'tech', 'learn', 'how', 'be', 'human', 'again', 'especially', 'say', 'love', 'get', 'that.But', 'reason', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'difference', 'movie', 'so-so', 'direction', 'slipping', 'preachy-ness', 'versus', 'first', 'class', 'adventure', 'comedy', 'romance', 'so', 'engaging', 'never', 'once', 'realize', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'get', 'preachy', 'measure', 'good', 'movie', 'never', 'see', 'actors', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'etc', 'Instead', 'have', 'experience', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'first', 'last', 'never', 'lapse', 'great', 'truth', 'learn', 'woven', 'perfectly', 'seamlessly', 'fabric', 'story', 'itself.This', 'movie', 'short', 'standard', 'plot', 'simple', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'growing', 'more', 'more', 'disconnected', 'dad', 'survivalist', 'elder', 'brother', 'may', 'have', 'solution', 'pretend', 'three', 'days', 'modern', 'world', 'know', 'been', 'blown', 'away', 'just', 'family', 'alone', 'trying', 'survive', 'finally', 'coming', 'together', 'team.But', 'there', 'point', 'story', 'where', 'least', 'fell', 'out', 'movie', '34', 'what', 'are', 'doing', '34', 'zone', 'when', 'have', 'chop', 'up', 'piece', 'furniture', 'firewood', 'Everybody', ""'re"", 'just', 'pretending', 'house', 'wife', 'not', 'going', 'just', 'let', 'chop', 'up', 'old', 'piece', 'furniture', 'game', 'did', ""n't"", 'build', 'motivation', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'happening', 'not', 'even', 'universe', 'created', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'started', 'seeing', 'actors', 'just', 'people', 'reading', 'script', 'uncritically', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'there', 'story', 'either', 'So', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'point', 'forward', 'became', 'work', 'finish', 'watching', 'it.Others', 'may', 'enjoy', 'more', 'did', 'was', 'movie', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'anything', 'happening', 'might', 'bother', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'Well', 'perhaps', 'one', 'scene', 'angry', 'doll', 'was', 'creepy', 'one', 'better', 'moments', 'movie', 'other', 'harmless', 'fun', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'fun', 'top', 'notch', 'direction']",3 Day Christmas
