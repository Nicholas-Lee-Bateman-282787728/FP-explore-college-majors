It has almost become a Hollywood rule remakes are never on par with the originals. Just as sequels are not as good as the original.Howard Zieff's &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; is a nice exception. I admit I don't think it's quite as good as the Sturges film (that one I would give 4 stars) it is still entertaining and funny at moments. I thought the absence of Preston Sturges would cause a decrease in the comedic possibilities, but, I forgot how good Dudley Moore and Albert Brooks are.Moore plays Claude Eastman a famous conductor who suspects his much younger wife Daniella (Nastassja Kinski) is cheating on him after the thought is first put into his head when a misunderstanding between Claude and his friend Norman (Albert Brooks) takes place and Norman thought Claude wanted him to hire a detective to watch his wife while Claude was out of town.Howard Zieff is not exactly what I would call a great director, he was the man behind &quot;The Main Event&quot; and the &quot;My Girl&quot; films, but, he strings things together nicely here. The script, while perhaps not as funny as Sturges' is not completely a dud. Barry Levinson had a hand in the remake, so expects some funny bits.One of my favorite scenes is at the restaurant when Moore &quot;thinks&quot; Armand Assante is confronting him about having an affair with his wife, and the start a dueling violin contest of Tchaikovsky.Also I should mention I the film's one advantage. In the scene dealing with Moore's plan to kill his wife it's set-up much funnier.Bottom-line:Remake of the classic Preston Sturges comedy is not exactly as good as the original but offers its own nice moments. Good performances by Moore and Brooks (who isn't used enough).",3,&quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; Is Remade In Good &quot;Faith&quot;,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,2093,"[""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'version', 'quot', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'original', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'verison', 'favorite', 'films', 'pretty', 'large', 'order', 'considering', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'directed', 'quot', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lady', 'Eve', 'quot', 'feelings', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'like', 'remake', 'almost', 'become', 'Hollywood', 'rule', 'remakes', 'are', 'never', 'par', 'originals', 'Just', 'sequels', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original.Howard', 'Zieff', 'quot', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'quot', 'nice', 'exception', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Sturges', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'still', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'moments', 'thought', 'absence', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'would', 'cause', 'decrease', 'comedic', 'possibilities', 'forgot', 'how', 'good', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'are.Moore', 'plays', 'Claude', 'Eastman', 'famous', 'conductor', 'who', 'much', 'younger', 'wife', 'Daniella', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'cheating', 'thought', 'first', 'put', 'head', 'when', 'misunderstanding', 'Claude', 'friend', 'Norman', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'place', 'Norman', 'thought', 'Claude', 'wanted', 'hire', 'detective', 'watch', 'wife', 'Claude', 'was', 'town.Howard', 'Zieff', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'great', 'director', 'was', 'man', 'quot', 'Main', 'Event', 'quot', 'quot', 'My', 'Girl', 'quot', 'films', 'things', 'together', 'nicely', 'here', 'script', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Sturges', 'not', 'completely', 'dud', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'had', 'hand', 'remake', 'so', 'funny', 'bits.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'restaurant', 'when', 'Moore', 'quot', 'quot', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'confronting', 'having', 'affair', 'wife', 'start', 'dueling', 'violin', 'contest', 'Tchaikovsky.Also', 'should', 'mention', 'film', 'one', 'advantage', 'scene', 'dealing', 'Moore', 'plan', 'kill', 'wife', 'set-up', 'much', 'funnier.Bottom-line', 'Remake', 'classic', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'comedy', 'not', 'exactly', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'own', 'nice', 'moments', 'Good', 'performances', 'Moore', 'Brooks', 'who', ""n't"", 'used', 'enough']",N/A

494187,A2DM12Q3QQ9E4J,B000006GET,"Jonsam Friedman ""Symbilbooks""","[0, 0]","What I thought at first to be farcical comedy, turned into the genre of the horror story popular in Europe where the man become psychologically demented and going deeper and deeper into Freudian hysteria. This is not funny anymore but becomes a horror film in the classic style, much like the movie with Kinski before ""Cat People."" We see the protagonist become more and more demented with his own problem- this goes to a classic movie genre, and Kinski continues to show Hollywood how a film should be made in old school genre of the psychological horror.It would take more research, but this form of psychological thriller horror film done in an artistic style was literally invented in Germany with the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and did finally come to America where the horror film continued from the 20s onward. How much did Kinski have her hand in the idea of this film; I would assume a lot, since I have seen very few films like this that were not out of Europe, the only difference is Kinski seems to have taught the director and actors how to act in a ""European manor"" or acting. However because the English language isn't suited in the same fashion, it looks oddly out of place in this American film.I am not sure why the other reviewers said this was funny. After the first 10 minutes it was not funny at all but pure psychological horror if not Freudian. This is where Kinski parts from the norm in aspects of pure cinematic genius; she is a ton smarter about acting and movie philosophy than lets on. Kinski has gotten Dudley Moore and other actors to act how she see fits, as they obviously are good, working actors but that's where it ends-- they have not been taught acting in the classic sense-- and that is where this movie runs into more trouble and falls short of a masterpiece. But fortunately, the screen loves Kinski and she is a master at this genre of movie and the only one in the film, making the film impossible to stop watching as you see the master actress Kinski, carrying the film. No one on the set or other actors can keep pace with her utter and perfect brilliance, she is working on all cylinders here, and it is obvioiusly true then she is one of the best, classic, trained actresses of our time--- however it doesn't lift this nice try out of the doldrums.",3,Kinski carries film,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,2293,"['What', 'thought', 'first', 'be', 'farcical', 'comedy', 'turned', 'genre', 'horror', 'story', 'popular', 'Europe', 'where', 'man', 'become', 'psychologically', 'demented', 'going', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'Freudian', 'hysteria', 'not', 'funny', 'anymore', 'horror', 'film', 'classic', 'style', 'much', 'movie', 'Kinski', 'Cat', 'People', 'see', 'protagonist', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'demented', 'own', 'problem-', 'classic', 'movie', 'genre', 'Kinski', 'show', 'Hollywood', 'how', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'old', 'school', 'genre', 'psychological', 'horror.It', 'would', 'take', 'more', 'research', 'form', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'horror', 'film', 'done', 'artistic', 'style', 'was', 'literally', 'invented', 'Germany', 'Cabinet', 'Dr.', 'Caligari', 'did', 'finally', 'come', 'America', 'where', 'horror', 'film', 'continued', '20s', 'onward', 'How', 'much', 'did', 'Kinski', 'have', 'hand', 'idea', 'film', 'would', 'assume', 'lot', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'Europe', 'only', 'difference', 'Kinski', 'have', 'taught', 'director', 'actors', 'how', 'act', 'European', 'manor', 'acting', 'However', 'English', 'language', ""n't"", 'suited', 'same', 'fashion', 'oddly', 'place', 'American', 'film.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'was', 'funny', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'pure', 'psychological', 'horror', 'not', 'Freudian', 'where', 'Kinski', 'parts', 'norm', 'aspects', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'ton', 'smarter', 'acting', 'movie', 'philosophy', 'lets', 'Kinski', 'gotten', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'other', 'actors', 'act', 'how', 'see', 'fits', 'obviously', 'are', 'good', 'working', 'actors', 'where', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'taught', 'acting', 'classic', 'sense', 'where', 'movie', 'more', 'trouble', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'fortunately', 'screen', 'Kinski', 'master', 'genre', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'impossible', 'stop', 'watching', 'see', 'master', 'actress', 'Kinski', 'carrying', 'film', 'one', 'set', 'other', 'actors', 'can', 'keep', 'pace', 'utter', 'perfect', 'brilliance', 'working', 'cylinders', 'here', 'obvioiusly', 'true', 'then', 'one', 'best', 'classic', 'trained', 'actresses', 'time', 'however', ""n't"", 'lift', 'nice', 'try', 'doldrums']",N/A

Apart from ""10"" this is the ""must have"" Moore comedy. He, along with Nastassja Kinski and Armand Assante go through a myriad of scenarios involving the perception of infidelity. The cast is further enhanced by Albert Brooks and Richard Libertiny. Moore plays a middle-aged composer/conductor named Claude Eastman, Assante plays his best friend and famous violinist Max Stein. Nastassja Kinski plays  Moore's wife Daniella who is about half Claude's age. The plot revolves around a lot of misunderstandings and misreadings between the main characters resulting in Claude's convictions about his wife and Max having an affair. Brooks' character is named Norman and is married to Carla (Cassie Yates). Libertiny plays Guiseppe who as Claude's buttler is hilarious with is thick Italian accent. Norman misunderstands Guiseppe and hires a private-eye to keep tabs on Daniella. He figures that is what his pal Claude wanted when in reality all he wanted was for him to look after her. Claude in turn gets a report from the private-eye who himself misconstrudes the information. Armed with what he thinks is proof, Claude sets a plan to get rid of his infidel wife and her lover (Assante). What happens after that is the juxtaposition of the events as Claude planned them and how they really turn out. The humor is silly and yet very clever. Moore's performance is fantastic as he plays another scene where his character is drunk (a la Arthur and very funny). My favorite scene happens in the kitchen and involves Moore and Assante (I will not reveal it so that you see it for yourselves). Brooks is well suited to play Norman against Yate's Carla who ends up being the one who starts it all. In all, the movie plays very well, is one of my all-time-favorite comedies and it could not have been casted any better. It almost feels as if the cast lived together for a while in order to nail their characters as well as they did. Films like this are hard to come by these days. Hollywood seems to concentrated in putting a lot of money and effects in their fare leaving films like this to smaller independent outfits. The movie also keeps a pretty high decorum regarding the handling of sexual themes. Once again, content over hype. This film prooves that you don't have to get rauchy or rely on gross-out humor to be funny.

To enjoy this picture, it will also help  viewers ifthey are (even moderate) fans of classical music ( such as ofStravinsky's Violin Concertos, for example), in addition to good,clean, above-board humor, never going bottom feeding for laughs.The plot has to do with what goes on in a man's mind, when he'sacheived everything, such as the ultimate in public recognition(Carnegie Hall conductor), wealth, career, success, money, and abeautiful wife.The answer, of course, is the fear and deep concern of losing all,or any of those, especially the woman, played here convincingly byKinski, the latter who really comes alive (unlike many of her othermovies), with a playful, expressive, affectionate, fresh,extroverted, revealing, feminine, elegant presence.Surrounding that paranoia of jealousy and infidelity, Moore succeedsin his own classy manner, in generating a multitude of laughs overthe 90 mins, although the picture does seem to go offrack at the 75minute mark and afterwards, a bit psychotic.The soundtrack is done to a perfection, comprising hand-pickednumbers that only a veteran of the business could have selected.
