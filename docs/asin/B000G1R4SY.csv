998592,A3IVZV4GLD9QL7,B000G1R4SY,Amanda,"[16, 24]","I love the Gilmore Girls... I would rate every other season a full ""5"" stars. Season 6, however, was insufferable because a) there was barely a storyline going, most of the episodes were 90% pointless fill and b) the fact that virtually every character in the series fell out of character. True, problems need to arise on drama shows, especially when the shows claim to be true-to-life, otherwise there is no story to tell. But this season took the simple idea of making the previously realistic-yet-interesting lives of Lorelai and Rory a bit edgier to an extreme. The once witty, intelligent, independent, insightful, and confident girls suddenly turn into dull, dependent, blindingly besotted girls making one bad decision after another in season 6. The Lorelai and Rory fight in the first half of the story was painfully drawn out. Past Seasons' Lorelai would have never let a fight with her beloved daughter Rory go on that long; she'd learned enough from her own difficult relationship with her parents to know that it isn't worth risking her once-smooth relationship with her daughter just to hold a childish grudge. When the two finally reconciliate after many painful episodes, the characters still don't share many of the same scenes or adventures in the rest of the season. Rory spends most of her time besotted with Logan, who treats her like absolute dirt. Past Seasons' Rory would have recognized what a jerk he is and dumped him immediately, but Season Six Rory thought it was great that he was cheating on her, ignoring her, walking all over her. Past Seasons' Rory was resilient (think back to when Jess left her in season 3) and had a good head on her shoulders; that's why I loved her. I was absolutely sickened by the fact that they turned her into the stereotypically troubled college student. Newsflash to writers: not all (in fact, hardly any) college students, particularly students smart and hardworking enough to get into an Ivy League school, would be a) satisfied planning DAR events for four months b) allow one person's criticism to dash their college plans and career hopes c) be free to run off to the Hamptons on a weekend in the middle of the semester when they're taking over the normal class load and are the editor-in-chief of their school's newspaper d) etc. I despise the fact that Rory suddenly and uncharacteristically turned into this troubled wild college girl monster stereotype that smart shows like Gilmore Girls shouldn't buy into.Meanwhile in this season, during which, by the way, the show should have been re-named ""Gilmore Girls' Relationships"" since as I write this I realize how very little time Lorelai and Rory actually spent together or had the story about their lives together in this season... Lorelai and Luke hit tough times when Luke gets a surprise and, unlike Past Season Luke, who would have run to Lorelai first thing for advice, withdraws from his relationship with her. The loveably gruff Luke that everyone had a soft spot for in seasons 1-5 turns into an absolutely unloveable ogre, which was so frustrating that it made me cheer for happiness in the season finale when Lorelai finally let him know how she felt.I could go on... but you get the idea. The characters were not the same people we knew and loved in season 1-5. Actress Lauren Graham (Lorelai) has commented in media interviews that she wasn't crazy about season 6's storylines, and her (and other actors') lack of enthusiasm shows with, for the first time in the series, forced acting and unenthusiastic delivering of lines in numerous episodes. I don't blame the actors; I blame the writing... if I were an actor I'd have trouble getting out some of the pathetically lame, unrealistic, and uncharacteristic lines that the writers dished to the actors this year. There were fewer witty references and lots of cringe-worthy dirty quips and -groan- for the first time ever, profuse use of animal humour instead of those witty lines that the girls used to deliver.So combined with the fact that there was very little story and a lot of fill during tis season, this season was a waste and I wish someone would do it over. However... with that said... this is still the best show on television. It is still wittier, more original, and all-around more enjoyable than any other drama or sitcom on television. It is intelligent (or, at least in season 6, more intelligent than most shows, even if the quality did drop this season) and it is unique (again, the stories and dialogue were more unique other seasons) and it has more going for it than basically all of the other shows on television right now combined. There were a few bright moments in the season; primarily I'm thinking of the Lane storyline and bringing Jess back (what an amazing turn of events for the character and I really hope he had an affect on Rory). So, I suppose it would be a shame for you to miss out on owning this season of DVDs if you've already collected the others. However, if you're new to GG, definitely watch the earlier seasons because they are, simply put, better.",3,Insufferable Filler ... but better than anything else on television,1153612800,"07 23,

The last ep. of Season Five set up the season to begin with Rory dropping out of Yale and moving in with her grandparents both moves a big slap in the face to her mother Lorelei and Lorelei's proposal to Luke. We were left all summer long wondering what would happen. Every ep. of Season Six was a must see t.v. and yet the end of each ep. I was left disappointed and drained. The split between Lorelei and Rory was difficult to watch and it dragged out far to long I think Lorelei should have at least tried to get Rory to listen to reason. I don't know if it was the writing or what but I found it very difficult to feel any sympathy for Rory during the split. It just seemed to come off as another rich spoiled brat then a girl who lost her direction. The writers have been pointing Rory into the richie rich world since season five to create conflict but for me its making it harder to care about Rory. I was happy wehn she finally realized the uselessness of her life and went back to her mother. I liked how Richard and Emily were taking the oppuntunty as a chance to fix the mistakes they made with Lorelei. Rory's always had a good relationship with her grandparents and rarely any of the problems Lorelei has until she experienced living with them. I was happy to see this. But I still feel Rory owes Richard and Emily an apology for the way she left no matter how difficult Richard and Emily are she made the choice to live with them. Their reunion was welcomed but I think Rory owed her mother an apology.Asside from her estrangement from Rory, Luke says yes to Lorelei's proposal without hesitation and plans their wedding. They remodel her house and she adopts a dog. But the wedding plans come to a halt when Luke learns he's a dad. I like many fans was skeptical of the long lost daughter angle. But the actress playing April is great and I really loved the new charactor. I liked April and Luke's relationship. What I didn't like was Luke's hiding the information from Lorelei after their argument about honesty and have Lorelei find out on accident. Its understandable for Luke to be thrown for a loop at learning has a kid and how to handle suddenly being a dad to an eleven year old but it was out of charactor for Luke to keep it from Lorelei and then procede to exclude Lorelei his daughter. I also can't see Lorelei not calling Luke on this instead we got a very sad Lorelei and no wedding.Rory and Logan's relationship contiuned to go up and down. I can't stand Logan and had hoped they would break up for good. All his drinking, partying, stupid friends and pranks. I hate the nickname ""ace"". His whining about how he's life's going to be over when June comes. I don't like the person Rory is when she's with him or forgiving him for being a jerk or cheating on her with half of a bridal party. I really thought this was going to end up being more about Rory's relationship with Christopher. The scene when Logan and Christopher are exchanging stories  about schools they were being kicked out of I thought this was it Rory was finally going to realize it but I was diappointed.I liked the evolution of Lane and Zach's relationship they became a welcome relief from all the sad and disappointing storylines. From Hep Alien's tour, to their breakup and to their two beautiful weddings. Lane and Mrs. Kim's relationship has become so wonderful. I love how Mrs. Kim supports Lane's decisions while keeping true to her own beliefs the same goes for Lane.  I loved Paris from her lunches with Lorelei, crappy and scary apartment, the way she ran the Yale Daily news like a dictator and when she became broke. Sookie and Jackson were great as always and so was Michel. I loved the big Gilmore fight in Friday Nights Alright for Fighting and the scarying insurence stories Richard told Luke and Lorelei in You've Been Gilmored. Lorelei's idea for Halloween, Paul Anka the crazy dog and the girls' soccor team Luke sponsered.",5,An Up and Down Sixth Season,1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,4025,"['most', 'heartbreaking', 'difficult', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'season', 'watch', 'date', 'last', 'ep', 'Season', 'Five', 'set', 'up', 'season', 'begin', 'Rory', 'dropping', 'Yale', 'moving', 'grandparents', 'moves', 'big', 'slap', 'face', 'mother', 'Lorelei', 'Lorelei', 'proposal', 'Luke', 'were', 'left', 'summer', 'long', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'ep', 'Season', 'Six', 'was', 'must', 'see', 't.v', 'yet', 'end', 'ep', 'was', 'left', 'disappointed', 'drained', 'split', 'Lorelei', 'Rory', 'was', 'difficult', 'watch', 'dragged', 'out', 'far', 'long', 'think', 'Lorelei', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'tried', 'get', 'Rory', 'listen', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'writing', 'what', 'found', 'very', 'difficult', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Rory', 'split', 'just', 'seemed', 'come', 'off', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'then', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'direction', 'writers', 'have', 'been', 'pointing', 'Rory', 'richie', 'rich', 'world', 'season', 'five', 'create', 'conflict', 'making', 'harder', 'care', 'Rory', 'was', 'happy', 'wehn', 'finally', 'realized', 'uselessness', 'life', 'went', 'back', 'mother', 'liked', 'how', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'were', 'taking', 'oppuntunty', 'chance', 'fix', 'mistakes', 'made', 'Lorelei', 'Rory', 'always', 'had', 'good', 'relationship', 'grandparents', 'rarely', 'problems', 'Lorelei', 'experienced', 'living', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'still', 'feel', 'Rory', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'apology', 'way', 'left', 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'are', 'made', 'choice', 'live', 'reunion', 'was', 'welcomed', 'think', 'Rory', 'owed', 'mother', 'apology.Asside', 'estrangement', 'Rory', 'Luke', 'yes', 'Lorelei', 'proposal', 'hesitation', 'wedding', 'remodel', 'house', 'dog', 'wedding', 'come', 'halt', 'when', 'Luke', 'dad', 'like', 'many', 'fans', 'was', 'skeptical', 'long', 'lost', 'daughter', 'angle', 'actress', 'playing', 'April', 'great', 'really', 'loved', 'new', 'charactor', 'liked', 'April', 'Luke', 'relationship', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Luke', 'hiding', 'information', 'Lorelei', 'argument', 'honesty', 'have', 'Lorelei', 'find', 'out', 'accident', 'understandable', 'Luke', 'be', 'thrown', 'loop', 'learning', 'kid', 'how', 'handle', 'suddenly', 'being', 'dad', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'charactor', 'Luke', 'keep', 'Lorelei', 'then', 'procede', 'exclude', 'Lorelei', 'daughter', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Lorelei', 'not', 'calling', 'Luke', 'instead', 'got', 'very', 'sad', 'Lorelei', 'wedding.Rory', 'Logan', 'relationship', 'contiuned', 'go', 'up', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Logan', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'break', 'up', 'good', 'drinking', 'partying', 'stupid', 'friends', 'pranks', 'hate', 'nickname', 'ace', 'whining', 'how', 'life', 'going', 'be', 'over', 'when', 'June', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'person', 'Rory', 'when', 'forgiving', 'being', 'jerk', 'cheating', 'half', 'bridal', 'party', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'Rory', 'relationship', 'Christopher', 'scene', 'when', 'Logan', 'Christopher', 'are', 'exchanging', 'stories', 'schools', 'were', 'being', 'kicked', 'thought', 'was', 'Rory', 'was', 'finally', 'going', 'realize', 'was', 'diappointed.I', 'liked', 'evolution', 'Lane', 'Zach', 'relationship', 'became', 'welcome', 'relief', 'sad', 'disappointing', 'storylines', 'Hep', 'Alien', 'tour', 'breakup', 'two', 'beautiful', 'weddings', 'Lane', 'Mrs.', 'Kim', 'relationship', 'become', 'so', 'wonderful', 'love', 'how', 'Mrs.', 'Kim', 'Lane', 'decisions', 'keeping', 'true', 'own', 'beliefs', 'same', 'Lane', 'loved', 'Paris', 'lunches', 'Lorelei', 'crappy', 'scary', 'apartment', 'way', 'ran', 'Yale', 'Daily', 'news', 'dictator', 'when', 'became', 'broke', 'Sookie', 'Jackson', 'were', 'great', 'always', 'so', 'was', 'Michel', 'loved', 'big', 'Gilmore', 'fight', 'Friday', 'Nights', 'Alright', 'Fighting', 'scarying', 'insurence', 'stories', 'Richard', 'told', 'Luke', 'Lorelei', ""'ve"", 'Been', 'Gilmored', 'Lorelei', 'idea', 'Halloween', 'Paul', 'Anka', 'crazy', 'dog', 'girls', 'soccor', 'team', 'Luke', 'sponsered']",Gilmore Girls: S6 (DVD)

998596,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000G1R4SY,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[15, 18]","Season six of the critically acclaimed series had fans of the show split down the middle just like with season 4, although maybe less strongly. The reason?. Well, there's a couple. We'll get to that in a minute. Season six is a fine season for the series, but it hits some minor bumps along the way. It picks up right where season 5 left off, with Lorelai getting the call that Rory is in jail for taking out a yacht with Logan. ""New And Improved Lorelai"" is the season premiere, and it's a good one. The mother and daughter are on the outs, and Rory gets sentenced for her crime. The consequences for the crime are played out over the next few episodes. ""We've Got Magic To Do"", is a solid episode that will have you cheering for Richard and Emily, and Mitchum Huntzberger and his wife getting theirs. Richard comes to his senses about their arrangement with Rory in ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"", which includes a sweet gesture by Richard with the aforementioned dollhouse. Jess rears his head again in ""Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ring Out"", which has him speaking some sense into Rory over all of the recent drama. Mother and daughter are finally reunited in the fantastic ep, ""The Prodigal Daughter Returns"". The second half of the season has some great eps and moments, but it's the twist that divided the fans. Luke learns he is a dad, and the following revelation puts a damper on Luke and Lorelai's relationship. A lot of people hated this turn of events and April, but I love the character. She fits in with the GG lingo, and the actress is phenomenal in the role. But poor Lorelai. What will this mean in the long run between her and Luke?. What's a drama without conflict?. People also had a problem with the ongoing seperation between Lorelai and Rory during the first part of the season. While it wasn't always feel good, I liked it because it showed more conflict(there's that word again)in their relationship when things have always been pretty rosy. Other notable eps here include the Thanksgiving episode, ""He's Slippin 'Em Bread...Dig?"", ""The Real Paul Anka"", and ""I Get A Sidekick Out Of You"". The season finale, ""Partings"", sets up some interesting things, but I was not satisfied with it as I was with past season finales. Season six also includes a wedding(you'll find out who), and other goodies. Some story choices weren't the best, and the mother/daughter seperation, even tho I liked them trying something different, just felt wrong. For any of the flaws that season six has, they have just as many, if not more, great moments that totally make up for it. The writing is still top notch, and the cast is still one of TV's best ensembles.

998597,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000G1R4SY,barry,"[16, 20]","Gilmore Girls is one of the best series to ever be on television.  It has succeeded to bring to life such realistic characters that have become real.  The show has always seemed more like real life when compared to other shows.  We have experienced the ups and downs, loves and losses of these people- Lorelai, Luke, Rory, Sookie, Emily, Richard- the list goes on.Season 5 ended with what fans have been longing for-  the union of Lorelai and Luke as a couple.  Season 6 could have flowed a little better, but the writers took many chances here as they kept the show true to form- inventive, true to life and always bringing up the unexpected.Let's be serious.  Many are upset that Luke and Lorelai didn't just continue walking into the splendors of love's bliss but these are real, complex characters and both bring much baggage.  Also, life just doesn't go complication free.Lorelai, played by the rare and extremely gifted Lauren Graham, has always been extremely strong and fought thru thick and thin.  This season her world had many hits- Rory was out of her life for a long while and Luke, whether due to his introduced daughter or not, was very noncommital about the marriage.  She had put her heart on the line and she had too much.Seeing these episodes in secondary viewing, I can't wait for the uninterrupted viewing on dvd.  Lorelai had an emotional breakdown this year.  It was just too much and her depression grew as the season progressed.  It should have been and Emmy for Lauren.The show was true to life as it always has been.  Lorelai is human and can only take so much.  To just stick with Luke and Lorealai as a happy couple would have been unrealistic - it would have taken the show out of of its true form - continuous exploration of the shows complex characters.I myself am not at all concerned with the departure of the shows main creative force and have much hope and anticipation for season 7.  Also, to all you Gilmore fans who say stop watching the show - if you loved the show so much you would forgive a season that was different in form from others.  All long running shows have had this.  Loyal fans will be back and never have lost their love for this innovative, creative work of art.Compared to other tv, even a slightly off season is far superior.

It's FICTION, so don't believe that any but the luckiet of mothers will raise a Rory.  Nevertheless, it is fun watching their antics and their kookiness.  Occassionaly, Lorelai gets on my nerves.  She is just too flighty and irresponsible - sometimes still the rebellious 16 years old locked in a time loop.  I wish she'd grow up even a bit more.  It's hard to really appreciate her pain with the breakup with Luke because she is the one who pretty much dumped everyone else, except Christopher (whom I think she didn't really love anyway).  I so wished it would work with Luke because they really did &#34;get&#34; each other. It was so heartwarming watching their relationship grow. That is another thing that gets me about Lorelai; her anger is so destructive (like an out of control two-year old)! It was realistic thata Lorelai would get fed up with waiting,but once she did, like Rory said, there were other ways to work it out.  Using Christopher, though very human, was very cruel. Rory with Logan is cute, but you can see that there is no future.  Rory's relationships (in past seasons as well as this one) were the one thing in the show that seem realistic.  Good guy, bad boy, fun-but-no-future boy ,it's all in there.

I had completely forgotten about it until I received it several months later. I wasn't for sure what I was going to use the card for. Late one night, I surfed Walmart.com and found the sixth season of Gilmore Girls for fewer than twenty dollars. Of course I had to order it. I have been watching Gilmore Girls ever since I stumbled upon it on the late Soap.net channel earlier this year, but I watch it every weekday morning (if there isn't some kind of marathon) on ABC Family, which had just started airing the sixth season. I received the DVD set very quickly and just like season one and two (that I own on DVD); I flew right through each episode, taking in every bit of the Gilmore Wisdom.The episodes on season six are:Disc One:Episode 1: New and Improved Lorelai (9/13/05)Episode 2: Fight Face (09/20/05)Episode 3: The UnGraduate (09/27/05)Episode 4: Always a Godmother, Never a God (10/4/05)Disc Two:Episode 5: We've Got Magic to Do (10/11/05)Episode 6: Welcome to the Dollhouse (10/18/05)Episode 7: Twenty-One Is the Loneliest Number (10/25/05)Episode 8: Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing Out (11/8/05)Disc Three:Episode 9: The Prodigal Daughter Returns (11/15/05)Episode 10: He's Slippin' 'Em Bread ... Dig? (11/22/05)Episode 11: The Perfect Dress (1/10/06)Episode 12: Just Like Gwen and Gavin (1/17/06)Disc Four:Episode 13: Friday Night's Alright for Fighting (1/31/06)Episode 14: You've Been Gilmored (2/7/06)Episode 15: A Vineyard Valentine (2/14/06)Episode 16: Bridesmaids Revisited (2/28/06)Disc Five:Episode 17: I'm OK, You're OK (4/406)Episode 18: The Real Paul Anka (4/11/06)Episode 19: I Get A Sidekick Out of You (4/18/06)Episode 20: Super Cool Party People (4/25/06)Disc Six:Episode 21: Driving Miss Gilmore (5/2/06)Episode 22: Partings (5/9/06)There is a lot of emotional baggage that occurs through the sixth season as Lorelai and Rory spend nine episodes apart. During these episodes Lorelai gets engaged to Luke (she is the one who asked), she gets a dog named Paul Anka, and has her house remodeled. Everything changes at the end of episode nine as Rory returns home and Luke finds outs that he has a daughter named April. Unfortunately Lorelai doesn't make it down the aisle, but Rory's best friend, Lane, marries her band mate, Zach.Season six has a lot things going on in Star Hollows. I felt for Luke as he adjusted to being a father, but he had to push Lorelai away in the process. Did Lorelai overreact about all the April drama? Not really. All she wanted was to be part of April's life as she was going to be her step-mother. I didn't care for the last scene of the season with Lorelai in bed with you-know-who.

While it's frustrating and disappointing, it adds a bit of reality to the otherwise pristine life of Rory Gilmore.  It could easily been argued that her life was to unrealistic.Regardless of whether your a new fan or an old one, I highly recommend this series and season to you for viewing pleasure.

They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark throughout the seasons -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.In this season, Luke and Lorelai FINALLY become engaged...making the dreams of many fans become a reality after six years of flirtation. However, just as they've settled into a comfortable routine, Luke learns of a 12-year-old daughter he never knew he had. As if the plot weren't stupid enough, April is essentially a younger version of Rory -- smart, bookish, loquacious and endearingly geeky. Why couldn't they just have given more emphasis on the relationship between Luke and Rory?

998625,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000G1R4SY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","There is a wonderful irony in that there were more episodes of ""Happy Days"" after Fonzie jumped the shark than before that fateful episode that has become the iconic metaphor for when a television series jumps the shark, but that is the exception to the rule.  With half of the next season under its belt, I am convinced now more than ever that ""Gilmore Girls"" jumped the shark in the final scene of the final episode of the show's sixth season.  If fans thought they were not happy at the start of season six, with Lorelai and Rory estranged, that has proven to be nothing compared to their dissatisfaction at setting up yet another round of the Lorelai, Luke and Christopher triangle of disaster by season's end.  We start off being disappointed with Rory and end up shifting our disapproval to her mother.""Gilmore Girls: The Complete Sixth Season"" begins with Rory having dropped out of Yale and into the pool house at her grandparents' house and Luke providing the obvious answer to Lorelai's surprise proposal (""New and Improved Lorelai"").  Things started going badly at the end of the fifth season when Rory fell apart because Mitchum Huntsburger was out to get her just like she thought he was when he told her she did not have it (despite all evidence to the contrary, a point that even Paris should have been eager to point out to Rory).  When Rory was standing in the pool house and turned her back on her mother was the point where I wrote her off as a character and she did not get back into my good graces in season six until she called Mitchum and read him the riot act regarding not coming to see Logan in the hospital (""Driving Miss Gilmore""), which means I was not happy with her pretty much the entire season, especially when she turned into mini-Emily to run the D.A.R. bash (""We've Got Magic to Do""), which is ironically the episode where her grandparents finally get a clue as to what Mitchum had done and that their daughter was (gasp!) right about everything.Once mother and daughter are reunited the focus shifts to Luke and Lorelai on the road to matrimony, a trip that hits a massive detour when it turns out Luke has a daughter he never knew about (""The Prodigal Daughter Returns"").  But while Luke complains about Lorelai hiding her contact with Christopher (the father of her daughter) he refrains from telling her about April and the aforementioned road gets really rocky. For me the nadir of not only the season but the entire series is ""Super Cool Party People,"" when Lorelai goes to see Anna Nardini, who insists that April should not be around Luke and Lorelai because there is no guarantee they will be a couple.  I was so ticked off by the scene I had trouble sleeping that night because the whole conflict was so patently stupid (and that is without getting into the hypocrisy of the current season with Anna wanting to take April away from every relationship but one by moving to another state).  I can understand that Lorelai wanted Rory to decide she wanted to go back to college and I can understand that Luke did not want Lorelai stealing the spotlight away from him when he is trying to build a relationship with his daughter, but this nonsense about April should not get to know anybody else in Luke's life because there is no guarantee they will be there permanently is ridiculous (how did April ever deal with a new teacher or new classmates each year?).The high point of season six for me is the montage at the end of ""Friday Night's Alright for Fighting"" (never underestimate the importance of a good sorbet), which I think is the funniest prolonged sequence in the entire run of the series.  The other scene that I find particularly important is when Luke is up on the roof yelling at Lorelai about how he told Rory they were engaged and how he is in the middle of their fight because it is a scene that shows the two of them can have a fight in which they are funny and caring at the same time.  You know, I thought the whole point of keeping the Luke and Lorelai relationship off the front burner for so many seasons was so that when it finally happened the show would continue to work (i.e., unlike the celebrated fiasco that ""Moonlight"" became when David and Maddie finally got together).  Here is where we get to the nub of the problem, because at the end of season six the show loses its creator, which is why we get from bad to worst over in Stars Hollow.From the perspective of the current seventh season of  ""Gilmore Girls"" where the show has continued to decline it is now impossible not to look at the departure of creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, not to mention Daniel Palladino, as the major factor in the show's deterioration.  In fact, I now look at the final scene of the sixth season as a deliberate attempt by Sherman-Palladino to derail the show as she walked out the door.  Certainly the writers left behind have taken the implications of where Lorelia ends up and what she has just done and driven the show into the ground to the point where I would prefer it if this was the last season (current rumors are the CW wants an eighth season but Alexis Bledel is leaning towards no and Lauren Graham will not do the show without Bledel even if that is what the network wants).  Clearly the writers left behind cannot deal with the Gilmore girls in happy relationships, which is why the show has descended into the murky abyss of a soap opera instead of being the witty and wonderful series it had been before it jumped the shark.",4,"Things go from pretty bad to even worse in Season 6 of ""The Gilmore Girls""",1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,5493,"['wonderful', 'irony',

998631,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000G1R4SY,P Magnum,"[0, 0]","Season six of the Gilmore Girls is the season the show jumped the shark.  The introduction of a daughter Luke (Scott Patterson) never knew he had really sent the show off the rails.  The season starts with Rory (Alexis Bledel) taking time off from Yale & living in Hartford with her grandparents Emily & Richard (Kelly Bishop & Edward Herrmann) while Lorelei (Lauren Graham) tries to cope and move after Luke says yes to her marriage proposal.  Rory becomes involved in the DAR and Lorelei gets a dog she names Paul Anka and Luke has her house remodeled.  Rory finally goes back to Yale after she realizes that she is good enough to be a journalist despite what Logan's (Matt Czuchry) father said about her not being able to cut it.  Lorelei reconnects somewhat with Christopher (David Sutcliffe) after he comes into a large sum of money, but backs off after Luke becomes extremely jealous.  Luke calls of the wedding temporarily after he finds out about his daughter April (Vanessa Marano) and won't include Lorelei in his dealings with her.  This leads to tension between the two and final blow-up between them when Lorelei puts an ultimatum to Luke which causes them to break-up and the seasons ends with her in bed with Christopher.  In the meantime, Lane (Keiko Ageina) and Zack (Todd Lowe) get married and Logan graduates Yale and heads off to London to work for his father.  While the season still exhibits the sharp dialogue and rapid fire delivery, the transition of Rory towards being an adult and the ultimate break-up of Lorelei & Luke doesn't always ring true to the heart of the show.  Introducing April as a somewhat nerdy, super smart 12 year old (she's basically Rory but a math whiz instead of being into literature) who has a hip, smart talking mother (Sherilynn Fenn) seems ridiculous.  I guess it's meant to show that Lorelei is type of woman he's attracted to since April's mother is just like her.  The season still has its moments, but doesn't hold up to the prior seasons.",3,"Still Smart, But Coming Off The Rails",1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,1997,"['Season', 'six', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'season', 'show', 'jumped', 'shark', 'introduction', 'daughter', 'Luke', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'really', 'sent', 'show', 'rails', 'season', 'Rory', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'taking', 'time', 'Yale', 'living', 'Hartford', 'grandparents', 'Emily', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'Bishop', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'Lorelei', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'cope', 'move', 'Luke', 'yes', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Rory', 'becomes', 'involved', 'DAR', 'Lorelei', 'dog', 'Paul', 'Anka', 'Luke', 'house', 'remodeled', 'Rory', 'finally', 'back', 'Yale', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'journalist', 'what', 'Logan', 'Matt', 'Czuchry', 'father', 'said', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'cut', 'Lorelei', 'somewhat', 'Christopher', 'David', 'Sutcliffe', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'off', 'Luke', 'extremely', 'jealous', 'Luke', 'wedding', 'temporarily', 'out', 'daughter', 'April', 'Vanessa', 'Marano', 'wo', ""n't"", 'include', 'Lorelei', 'dealings', 'tension', 'two', 'final', 'blow-up', 'when', 'Lorelei', 'ultimatum', 'Luke', 'break-up', 'seasons', 'bed', 'Christopher', 'meantime', 'Lane', 'Keiko', 'Ageina', 'Zack', 'Todd', 'Lowe', 'get', 'married', 'Logan', 'Yale', 'heads', 'London', 'work', 'father', 'season', 'still', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'rapid', 'fire', 'delivery', 'transition', 'Rory', 'towards', 'being', 'adult', 'ultimate', 'break-up', 'Lorelei', 'Luke', ""n't"", 'always', 'ring', 'true', 'heart', 'show', 'Introducing', 'April', 'somewhat', 'nerdy', 'super', 'smart', '12', 'year', 'old', 'basically', 'Rory', 'math', 'whiz', 'instead', 'being', 'literature', 'who', 'hip', 'smart', 'talking', 'mother', 'Sherilynn', 'Fenn', 'ridiculous', 'guess', 'meant', 'show', 'Lorelei', 'type', 'woman', 'attracted', 'April', 'mother', 'just', 'season', 'still', 'moments', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'prior', 'seasons']",Gilmore Girls: S6 (DVD)

998634,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000G1R4SY,Robert Moore,"[29, 39]","First, I have to begin this review with what is simultaneously an expression of appreciation and concern.  Very late in Season Six it was announced that THE GILMORE GIRLS creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel Palladino had not reached an agreement concerning their contract and rather than accept a one-year contract rather than the two-year contract they were demanding, they decided to leave the show.  The contribution of these two individuals over the past six years has been immense.  Their fingerprints are all over the show.  Anyone who has seen or heard Amy Sherman-Palladino interviewed knows that Lorelei Gilmore is essentially an extension of Amy.  She and her husband created a wonderful show and as we head into Season Seven any fan cannot help but be a little nervous about things.  Amy and Daniel wrote by far the bulk of all the episodes and also directed many.  There is a sense in which Amy Sherman-Palladino WAS the show.  So even as I express a tremendous debt of gratitude for one of the finest quality TV shows of the past few years, I'll admit I'm scared about Season Seven.  Season Seven will almost definitely be the final year of the show.  The contracts of both Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel end at the end of next year and Lauren Graham, at least, has indicated that she doesn't see the show going past next year, though she hasn't absolutely ruled out accepting a new contract.By any standard, Season Six was the oddest in the show's run.  One thing that especially perplexed me was the way that many of the show's opening credits characters barely appeared in the show for long stretches at a time.  In fact, except for Lorelei, Rory, and Luke, all of the characters on the show disappeared for significant periods of time.  More than that, for significant periods of time some characters didn't interact at all.  Until fairly late in the year, Lorelei barely talked to her parents.  I especially missed the dinners that Lorelei and Rory would have at the Gilmore mansion and all of the wonderfully bitchy interchanges between the women.Season Five ended with Rory moving into the coach house at her grandparents, completely severing things with her mother.  This led to an odd period in Season Six in which Rory did community service (to atone for her legal misdeeds at the end of Season Five) and did some work with her grandmother's DAR chapter.  Meanwhile, Luke accepted Lorelei's proposal.  Things went smoothly until Luke discovered that he had a daughter he knew nothing about (April, played winningly by Vanessa Marano, who manages to do a convincing job of being a complete nerd and a very attractive teen at the same time).  Now, this is where the show lost me in Season Six, along with several friends I have who like the show.  Luke becomes inexplicably protective and secretive about his daughter April, not even revealing to Lorelei her existence for several weeks.  This rightfully bugs Lorelei but she reacts by assuming the worst that this portends somehow the end of their relationship.  Things go from bad to worse, eventually causing Lorelei to avoid Luke in the final couple of episodes, when she suddenly pops up at the diner and delivers the ultimatum that they go elope or end the relationship.  Luke quite reasonably declines such a suggestion from a woman who was acting somewhat hysterical, and the episode and season ends with Lorelei rushing into the arms of Chris, Rory's father.  So, Season Seven will end with Lorelei distraught (given the bleakness of her expression as she lay in Chris's bed in the final episode) and Luke perhaps thinking that their relationship had hit a rocky place but not knowing that she had cheated on him.  Most fans were left feeling that while Luke should have been less secretive about April and certainly shouldn't have kept them apart, Lorelei overreacted in a way that made her character somewhat unbelievable.  Lauren Graham has stated her own disagreements with the course the story in Season Six, so it is good to know that Lorelei herself agrees with the fans.Oh, and some things happen between Rory and her boyfriend, but I can't be bothered to remember what.  Seriously, does anyone still care about Rory's boyfriends?  I really feel that the show missed multiple opportunities with Rory's love life.  Like most fans, I liked Jared Parecki's character Dean, but I have detested both Milo Ventimiglia's Dean (I don't care if they are a real life couple, they lacked chemistry onscreen) and Matt Czuchry's Logan.  More and more, this is a part of the show I tolerate more than enjoy.Nonetheless, despite some strains in the plot lines this remained a first rate show.  There is a fictional work mentioned in some novel I once read (it may have been in THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE) entitled THE TRANSFIGURATION OF EVERYDAY LIFE.  In many ways, that describes the real subject matter of this show.  A whole universe of small, recognizable, familiar moments are transgured through their fictional representation.  The dialogue, perhaps not as razor sharp as on earlier seasons, is still about the best on TV.  And after six years, the characters are like a bunch of dear friends for whom we continue to pull.  I'll be honest:  I miss the old formula.  I miss the days when most episodes centered on Stars Hollow and Kirk and Taylor and Miss Patty and Sookie and Michel.  But I respect the way that they have striven to keep the show fresh and new.  That has meant taking the story to some places that might not have been my own first choice.Let me close by saying that the seventh season will also be the first on the new CW network.  The early rumors are that THE GILMORE GIRLS is most likely to be paired on its usual Tuesday night with VERONICA MARS.  This is going to be a great night of TV.  As much as I love THE GILMORE GIRLS, I absolutely adore VERONICA MARS, which I think along with LOST the best show on TV.  For my money, this will be the best back-to-back hours of the week on TV.  Hopefully they will manage to give a very fine show a proper final season.  The rumor all along has been that they hoped to go seven seasons, ending the show with the graduation of Rory from Yale and the marriage of Lorelei and Luke.  Whether that happens or not, it has been a remarkable run for a very fine show.Note:  each year Salon.com gives an award named after BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, the Buffy.  It is so named because although in the opinion of many TV critics and scholars BUFFY was one of the greatest television shows of the past ten or so years, and yet was almost completely ignored by the Emmys.  So each year The Buffy is given to the best show on TV neglected by the Emmys.  Last year the Buffy was given to VERONICA MARS.  I assume a show cannot receive the award twice.  If so, I hope that this year the award will go to one of the runners up from last year:  THE GILMORE GIRLS.  It is tragic the way that the rather conservative Emmys persistently ignores many of the best shows on TV to promote lesser shows that appear on the Big Four and HBO.",5,"Despite some controversial

998635,AGSWTH7SP2256,B000G1R4SY,R. W. Rasband,"[80, 90]","Lorelai Gilmore, as played by the wonderful Lauren Graham, is usually the merriest of characters, a wellspring of fun and laughter.  However, in this sixth season of ""Gilmore Girls"" she is forced to cope with levels of disappointment and heartache unprecedented in the show's history.  The first half of the season Lorelai is estranged from her usually ""freakishly close"" daughter, Rory (angelic Alexis Bledel); and in the second half she watches in anguish as her fiance and soulmate Luke (Scott Patterson) slips away from her.Some fans of the series were upset by the Lorelai's rift (including reportedly Graham herself) but I thought it was a daring move by the writers.  Rory has always been a little too good to be entirely believable, and it was interesting to watch Bledel's fine work at displaying Rory's bafflement in screwing up her life.  Graham also shone as she showed Lorelai's stoicism and trademark mental toughness as well as the grief lurking underneath.  When the reconciliation finally came it was a classic Gilmore moment.The revelation of Luke's long-lost daughter was derided by many as a ""Cousin Oliver"" moment, and I had problems myself with the haphazard plot mechanics.  But the emotional content of the storyline rang true.  Scott Patterson was touching as a man clearly in over his head, and once again Graham was heartrending as Lorelai desperately tried to hang on.  This season the many, many laughs were balanced by a lot of tears and some viewers didn't like it.  But if you view this season as part of the journey and not the final destination I think you will get a better perspective.  We all await with some trepidation a new season without the Palladinos, but given the set-up of this eventful sixth season the next could be fascinating.",5,"Sad Lorelai, In A Controversial Season",1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,1776,"['Lorelai', 'Gilmore', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'usually', 'merriest', 'characters', 'wellspring', 'fun', 'laughter', 'However', 'sixth', 'season', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'forced', 'cope', 'levels', 'disappointment', 'heartache', 'unprecedented', 'show', 'history', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'Lorelai', 'estranged', 'usually', 'freakishly', 'close', 'daughter', 'Rory', 'angelic', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'second', 'half', 'anguish', 'fiance', 'soulmate', 'Luke', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'away', 'her.Some', 'fans', 'series', 'were', 'upset', 'Lorelai', 'rift', 'including', 'reportedly', 'Graham', 'thought', 'was', 'daring', 'move', 'writers', 'Rory', 'always', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'entirely', 'believable', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Bledel', 'fine', 'work', 'displaying', 'Rory', 'bafflement', 'screwing', 'up', 'life', 'Graham', 'also', 'shone', 'showed', 'Lorelai', 'stoicism', 'trademark', 'mental', 'toughness', 'as', 'well', 'grief', 'lurking', 'underneath', 'When', 'reconciliation', 'finally', 'came', 'was', 'classic', 'Gilmore', 'moment.The', 'revelation', 'Luke', 'long-lost', 'daughter', 'was', 'derided', 'many', 'Cousin', 'Oliver', 'moment', 'had', 'problems', 'haphazard', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'emotional', 'content', 'storyline', 'rang', 'true', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'was', 'touching', 'man', 'clearly', 'head', 'once', 'again', 'Graham', 'was', 'heartrending', 'Lorelai', 'desperately', 'tried', 'hang', 'season', 'many', 'many', 'laughs', 'were', 'balanced', 'lot', 'tears', 'viewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'view', 'season', 'part', 'journey', 'not', 'final', 'destination', 'think', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'perspective', 'await', 'trepidation', 'new', 'season', 'Palladinos', 'given', 'set-up', 'eventful', 'sixth', 'season', 'next', 'could', 'be', 'fascinating']",Gilmore Girls: S6 (DVD)

Rory takes a break from Yale and Lorelai deals with Luke's procrastination RE: marriage. Also, Lane's romance with the lead singer of her group becomes serious.This was an ok season with the exception of the Rory/Logan relationship. I did not think anything could be worse than her last boyfriend but I was wrong! Logan is incredibly annoying, treats her poorly and Rory just lines up for more. Plus, I find it difficult to relate to the 'dynasty' rich crowd that Rory hangs out with. To me they seem foolish and obnoxious. I also hate that most of the major characters are paired up. I miss the 'dating' aspect of the Girls. Having every major character either married or in a long term relationship is boring.I also think some of the characters need a bit of growth. Emily Gilmore needs to keep a maid, Lorelai needs to take responsibility for her actions, and please, have Rory grow a spine and stop acting like a snob.

998647,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000G1R4SY,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 2]","I never watched this show when it was on the air. The only episode I ever saw was the final episode and it seemed ok but no big deal. I didn't know the characters and I didn't really find the ""Previously On"" section terribly compelling. Everything seemed very contrived. Still, these were likeable characters in a decent enough show. I thought no more of it until a few months ago when I was searching for things to watch at my library, grabbed an early copy and got hooked.So maybe watching this season when the first few seasons are so fresh in my mind taints my enjoyment. During the fourth season there was a bit of dialogue between Rory and Paris where Rory said something to the effect of just trying to drive Paris crazy and Paris, in a display of self-knowledge, says ""oh like that's hard."" I laughed but I also noticed that the Paris-Rory tensions which had so dominated the first couple of seasons had eased up. The writers were comfortable with the characters and they didn't feel the need for histrionics. Sure, Rory was still trying to choose between the guy fromSupernatural: The Complete Fourth Season(not the most exciting guy but a good stable guy who really grows on you over time with consistancy) and the guy fromHeroes - Season One(comes off really cool at first but over time you realize that there's no much there - ok maybe I'm talking about the shows that they ended up on but their characters did confirm to those types) but it was still a fine show. I knew that it was the beginning of the end. The writers had developed the characters as much as they were ever going to develop them and it was all downhill from there.Jump ahead to season six and the log roll of suck has come back to haunt everyone. You know how it is when you are about to break up with a girlfriend of 2-3 years. You've changed and she's changed and you just aren't the two people who fell in love but you still see glimmers of what once was. So you spend a lot of time wondering if it's you or her and it's just sad. That's the best way to describe watching the sixth season. But there are so many more things wrong with it.For one thing, the writers have gone from being comfortable with the characters to being bored with the characters. Luke is grumpy. Lorelai is smart but angsty. Rory talks like the kid inProblem Child. Luke is grumpy. Kirk is weird. Michel is fashionably catty and gets most of the great lines. Paris is a crazy A-type personality. Taylor is eccentric and controlling (without much explanation as to why he's back to being mayor). Sookie and Parker are adorable. Every character has been set in stone.The one exception is Laine and Mrs. Kim who actually have a great storyline where they are relating as an adult mother and daughter instead of the tyrannical mother and the daughter who hides things in the first few seasons. They are a delight and the sole reason why I'm giving this review a 2nd star.In the absence of real character development there's a lot of contrived plotlines. The season begins with Rory ""crushed"" because Logan's dad said that she doesn't have it. So she retreats to her grandparent's guest house. Nothing in Rory's character up until that episode suggests that she would let the opinion of one person crush her dreams. And as she moves through the season she shows all the competancy we've expected from her since she is the fantasy ""perfect daughter"". Lorelai and Luke get engaged because Lorelai is sulking. Then it gets delayed and delayed and Lorelai sulks some more. Suddenly the funny and together woman of the previous five seasons is a whiny sulking jerk.And to keep with the tradition of a dying show whose writers don't have anything interesting for the characters, not one but TWO cousin olivers are introduced. The first is a dog for Lorelai who is supposed to be a high strung crazy nervous yappy dog according to the script. Unfortunately, the dog is laconic to the point of being bored. It's like everyone is pointing at the dog going ""look he's so crazy' and he falls asleep. That dog is a metaphor for the whole season. Then there's Luke's long lost daughter who shows up in the middle in order to cause more tensions between Luke and Lorelai. She's boring. The storyline is boring.Even worse, the rapid fire dialogue full of cultural references to movies and old books and cool television shows has been replaced by stupid references. Jesse and Rory will no longer flirt over their mutual appreciation ofHowl and Other Poems (City Lights Pocket Poets Series). Jesse does show up but he's preachy and only in the show to make Logan look like a jerk. Of course, Logan is already a jerk so why do we need to be reminded that Rory is the perfect example ofSmart Women/Foolish Choices: Finding the Right Men Avoiding the Wrong Ones (Signet)? The references to trashy 80s movies have ceased. Instead, the references are either non-existent or they are about reality shows and movies that were just out in the past year. One suspects that there was a test audience that sat around going ""Proust? Jack Kerouac? Hardbodies? We don't get it. Can't you make references to things that stupid people like? We'd watch more if you did."" And then someone listened to them.Finally, there was the episode where Jackson and Sookie find out that someone has planted marijuana in Jackson's garden and they spend the entire episode trying to get rid of the pot. As much as I hate the term ""jumping the shark"", the B storyline fits the bill. The Gilmore Girls is supposed to be droll and Oscar Wilde witty. Whacky hijinks are the staple of bad sitcoms. The fact that the show ends with Lorelai frowning doesn't mitigate the whacky hijink quotient. It just adds to the overall joylessness of the proceedings.Sadly, I know I'm going to watch the seventh season just because I was hooked, but if you can avoid watching this DVD or knowing that it exists, let yourself.

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[111, 126]","I have been a fan of the 'Gilmore Girls' since the second episode of the series (I never saw the pilot until the DVD release), and ever since that episode I had been hooked into this wonderful, magical, comedic, and heartfilled world with these characters.Season six starts off on a much different note, taking the show in a direction that it has never been: What would things be like if Lorelai and Rory where no longer friends, and never spoke?  After the rift between mother and daughter at the end of the fifth season, Rory dropped out of Yale and moved in with her Grandparents, aliennating her mother, who was eccentially at a loss for words on the entire subject.Trying to make up for each other's loss Rory starts to go down a path of wallowing and denial as her relationship with Logan gets more and more serious.  Lorelai on the otherhand has a wedding to plan and a new dog to take care off.Season Six while not as good of an overall quality as season five, is still a very strong and entertaining as ever, and for long time fans of the show there are more than a few surprises including the return of two old cast members, A very special wedding (which is probably the best episode of the series thus far), and a bittersweat goodbye to the series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino who's final episode as an Executive Producer will the finale, fitting titled: ""Partings""Season Six includes the following episodes:New and Improved LorelaiFight FaceThe UnGraduateAlways a Godmother, Never a GodWe've Got Magic to DoWelcome to the Doll HouseTwenty-One is the Loneliest NumberLet Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing OutThe Prodigal Daughter ReturnsHe's Slippin' `Em Bread...

Lauren Graham is amazing in her role as single mom Lorelai Gilmore who over the seasons blossoms from a manager at a local inn to an entrepreneur running her own establishment with her best friend and business partner, Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy). Lorelai is devoted her young daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) who is pretty, intelligent, and confident, though a bit naive when it comes to matters of the heart. Both mother and daughter go through their ups and downs over the seasons, but Season 6 marked a major change in the series in that we see Lorelai & Rory having a huge disagreement, and how this affects their relationship and those around them.For those new to the series, I'd definitely recommend watching it from Season One, otherwise there are too many blanks to fill in and one would be lost. In Season 6, Lorelai and Rory are estranged because Rory, against Lorelai's wishes, decides to take time off from Yale to think about her future. Lorelai and her boyfriend Luke (Scott Patterson) get engaged, and though their relationship seems very strong, there is a cloud on the horizon. Luke's discovery that he has a young daughter, April, brings him much happiness, but he finds himself unable to confide to Lorelai until it is almost too late. This also places a lot of stress on their relationship.Despite all of the gloominess that permeates this season, I was still entertained by the various story arcs, the excellent writing, and of course, wonderful acting!",5,The Gilmore Girls experience lots of downs this season,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,1539,"['Gilmore', 'Girls', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'amazing', 'role', 'single', 'mom', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', 'who', 'seasons', 'blossoms', 'manager', 'local', 'inn', 'entrepreneur', 'running', 'own', 'establishment', 'best', 'friend', 'business', 'partner', 'Sookie', 'St.', 'James', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Lorelai', 'devoted', 'young', 'daughter', 'Rory', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'who', 'pretty', 'intelligent', 'confident', 'bit', 'naive', 'when', 'matters', 'heart', 'mother', 'daughter', 'go', 'ups', 'downs', 'seasons', 'Season', '6', 'marked', 'major', 'change', 'series', 'see', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'having', 'huge', 'disagreement', 'how', 'relationship', 'them.For', 'new', 'series', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Season', 'One', 'otherwise', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'blanks', 'fill', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'Season', '6', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'are', 'estranged', 'Rory', 'Lorelai', 'wishes', 'take', 'time', 'Yale', 'think', 'future', 'Lorelai', 'boyfriend', 'Luke', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'get', 'engaged', 'relationship', 'very', 'strong', 'cloud', 'horizon', 'Luke', 'discovery', 'young', 'daughter', 'April', 'much', 'happiness', 'unable', 'confide', 'Lorelai', 'almost', 'too', 'late', 'also', 'lot', 'stress', 'relationship.Despite', 'gloominess', 'season', 'was', 'still', 'entertained', 'various', 'story', 'arcs', 'excellent', 'writing', 'course', 'wonderful', 'acting']",Gilmore Girls: S6 (DVD)
