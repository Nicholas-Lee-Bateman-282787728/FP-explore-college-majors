Instead, as a propaganda piece, it fails on all counts, even as the most marginal entertainment.The entire plot line is not credible in 1962, even as an artificial device, because, as a result of WWII, by 1950 there were over 50,000 interracial marriages of U.S. servicemen with Asians (in Japan, Korea, Philippines, and throughout Asia).The sequence of events and plot development are just incongruous and preposterous.

Yvette Mimeux plays Sloane, his much younger sister, recently returned from San Francisco after finishing college. With her, she has childhood chum, Paul Kahanna, (Bobby Darren) whom she has decided she wants to marry. Paul is 100% pure Hawaiian! Paul's mother, who regrets the loss of her ethnic group through intermarriage with Caucasians, never-the-less offers an engagement party at her house. King objects to the idea of marriage, and so does Sloane's sister-in-law, Laura. Laura arrived on the island many years ago to help raise Sloane after King's wife and son died in a tidal wave. Laura wants to marry King, but King's heart is small - he only wants no-strings sex with his girlfried, Mai Chen. But Mai has other plans; she wants to trap King into marriage by getting pregnant. Also thrown into the mix is Dr. Kahanna, Paul's half-Hawaiian/half Caucasian brother who despises the wealthy Howlands, yet is undeniably attracted to the beautiful, headstrong Sloane. The Howlands have always been a close-knit, unlikeable clan despite their extensive philanthropy. Will Sloane follow through with her plan to break away from Howland family traditions? Will King grow a heart? Will Mai and her slimy brother ruin King's chances to be elected senator? Will any ethnic Hawaiians be seen in this movie? One of my favorite scenes is where Paul and Sloane do a Hawaiian dance at their engagement party.

898242,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00083FZFE,Linda Linguvic,"[68, 76]","This 1962 film is set in Hawaii and, considering that it had just become a state a mere three years before, certainly captured the public's imagination and interest.  Charlton Heston is cast as a wealthy widower whose sister, Yvette Mimieux, is in love with a Polynesian, played by James Darren.  He vehemently objects to the marriage on racial grounds, but has no problem having his own little inter-racial affair with France Nuyen. Complications arise, especially when Nuyen becomes pregnant. There is a violent incident when the future bridegroom is murdered, and his doctor brother, George Chakiris, gets into a romance with Yvette Mimieux.  The whole film is about racial intolerance and it sends a strong message, which kept the story interesting.  The acting was good and Yvette Mimieux, then 20 years old, was a pleasure to look at.  The setting was beautiful too; I can never get tired of looking at films set in Hawaii.However, there was just a bit too much melodrama for my taste and although the story moved fast and was well plotted, I never felt any real emotion for the characters. And, as in the 60s, most of the people who were supposed to be Polynesian were really Caucasian actors with darkened skin, thereby losing authenticity. Usually, this kind of casting makes me angry, but this time I just relaxed and enjoyed the video, which was pleasant, dealt with a controversial theme, and was easy to follow.  But we can't expect all movies to be works of art.

I was young when it was released, and I loved the stars of it (well most of them) and it was the beginning of a love affair with Hawaii.  The story line is old, it's that outdated stuff about prejudice over skin color, that is similar to the West Side Story theme and others of that time.  But I really enjoy the acting of everyone in this (although not a Charlton Heston fan) and although I am younger than Yvette Mimeux as a young girl I thought she was so beautiful and I was such a fan of hers.  Also back in those days I was a James Darren fan  (especially being a South Philly girl myself as a child) despite his small role in this and also a George Chakaris fan and I so enjoy the acting and the beautiful scenery.  If you are young and you don't care for old movies, this won't do it for you.  If you're older like me, it could bring back some memories.

At heart there's an interesting enough dilemma - what happens when Charlton Heston's outwardly liberal and benign business `King' of his part of Hawaii (quite what business he's King of is never made clear) is faced with the prospect of sister Yvette Mimieux marrying Hawaiian James Darren? - but quickly descends into TV movie soap opera bathos as scandal threatens to destroy his political ambitions and his family. By the time it's drawing to a close, a laughably Freudian dream scene makes it clear that his problem isn't so much that she wants to marry a native but that she isn't marrying him...There are surprisingly strong supporting performances from George Chakiris, Aline MacMahon and France Nuyen as Heston's lover (he'll happily sleep with her, but he'll be damned if he'll accept their illegitimate half-caste son as his heir) and in the early stages the film does at least acknowledge that racism exists on both sides, but in director Guy Green's hands it's dreary, passionless stuff. He can't even generate any excitement in a hypothetically inflammatory dance scene between Mimieux and Darren that's supposed to set Chucky thinking dark thoughts but actually looks like the kind of thing you might see in a badly choreographed elementary school play performed by two pupils who've only just met and were threatened with detention if they didn't do it.
