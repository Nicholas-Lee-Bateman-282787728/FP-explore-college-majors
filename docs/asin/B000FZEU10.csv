The 2 lead actors and the French sister-in-law are great.  But even they can't save this mess from a director who obviously thinks that any stupid idea that he comes up with is flowing with artisitic brilliance. By the time the viewer is hit with his surprises toward the end, you just don't care that much because this film has already had more twists than a Chubby Checker concert and the characters are not that well developed.  As someone who was at Ground Zero and traumatized by that experience I came away feeling cheated and offended by yet another retarded attempt to cash in on the tragedy.  I thought this was going somewhere interesting when the female lead starts talking about her experience that day but unfortunately this ends up being as shameless and pointless as Nicolas Cage in World Trade Center.

997591,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FZEU10,A Customer,"[5, 7]","Can terrorism morph from within? Will American citizens, so angry and frustrated, one day commit acts of barbarism? These are the questions at the center of oddly titled Sorry, Haters, a subversive, shocking and totally disturbing film that attempts to project a post 9/11 scenario of what could happen given the right emotional vacuum.Hardworking Syrian cabdriver Ashade (Abdellatif Kechiche) gets more that he bargained for when he picks up the smartly dressed hard-charging career woman Phoebe (Robin Wright Penn). The naive Ashade just wants to earn enough money to pay for an immigration lawyer and support his sister-in-law who is illegally in the country.We realize pretty early on that there's something quite not right about this a Manhattan professional who works for Q Dog TV, a video music network. The movie begins at night, with Phoebe anxiously directing Ashade to take her to a New Jersey suburb, where she stealthily approaches a home, bursts into tears, and then scratches the side of a new Lexus with a rock.Unable to shake her - after all, he is a gentleman - she ends up sharing a bottle of wine with Ashade and his sister-in-law.  When Phoebe finds out that Ashade, a Syrian, needs help - his brother has been arrested for alleged ties to a suspected terrorist - she offers to step in. But is Phoebe all that she seems? Ashade begins to really freak out when she suggests the two of them ""do some damage,"" and then remarks, ""I don't know anything about munitions.""Without giving any more of the plot away, it soon becomes obvious that both Ashade and Phoebe are heading for some sort of cross-cultural showdown. Phoebe is indeed bad news, a sort of damaged and insecure soul, who is angry at the world and Muslims and also bitterly resents her self-obsessed best friend Phyllis (Sandra Ho) for being more successful than she is.Obviously, 9/11 has had a profoundly negative effect on this woman, but the scars also go much deeper, manifesting in a deep-seated hatred for everything that America and the West seems to represent.  The film is gritty and offbeat and totally provocative, as we witness Phoebe thoroughly unraveling and Ashade's ultimate frustration at letting this crazy woman into his life.Writer/director Jeff Stanzler has perfectly captured the impression of being off-kilter that all New Yorkers probably had at some stage since 9/11. But the film is mostly all about the actors, Kechiche gives a reserved and superbly troubled performance; and Wright-Penn, whose character's behavior is never predictable and seldom understandable, anchors the film. Her crippling coffers of resentment and wrath steadily rise to the surface, and it's a scary monster in full bloom, essentially horrific to watch.Sorry, Haters works on a number of levels - as a psychological thriller and as an examination of post-9/11 relations between Muslims and everyone else. And then there's the horrific conclusion, which is destined to leave audiences thinking and talking about it for hours after the movie has concluded. Mike Leonard August 06.",4,"""Do some damage.

997592,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000FZEU10,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Sorry, Haters is a really twisted take on the rocky relationship between the Americans and Muslims.  Before writing my review let me state that I probably didn't get the movie overall.  At least, the second half totally went over my head.What initially appears to be an American woman out for revenge with a short-sighted attitude problem and demanding that a Muslim cab driver take her wherever she desires to go (and willing to pay the guy a large sum of money to make it possible) we soon discover that the storyline is much deeper than that.  Eventually the Muslim takes a temporary stop at a house with a woman and small child, and the woman comes with him, basically invites herself in, and they communicate about how terrible the United States is.  We learn the woman and child are the family of the cab drivers brother.Eventually the discussion concerning the brother becomes an important aspect of the storyline and the woman tries to rationalize by carrying a decent conversation over what should be done about freeing the cab drivers brother, but... well for one thing we never see the brother.  It's all talk.  Second of all, the storyline changes into a different and WAY more confusing direction just as soon as we discover the woman snuck her way through the Muslims belongings and somehow took 500 bucks from the guy.  Actually right before this it would seem the woman set up a perfect trap so the Muslim couldn't escape at the top of a building after locking him up there with nowhere to go, but she -much to MY surprise at least- ends up giving him the door password, lets him run free, and then he's seen on the streets running from the security guards.  From here on out, the discussion over the brother is pushed aside (unless I missed something).Now the storyline turns *much* worse as the communication between the woman and the Muslim is never really fully understood until the very end, and even THEN I'm not sure what to make of it other than the woman has psychotic tendencies and had the Muslim guy completely under her spell the entire time.  I don't want to give away what happens at the *very* end though- two surprises actually, both of which are major and inappropriate to spoil for the readers.Overall, well just understand that the woman has mental issues and she's not capable of rationalizing and sympathizing like a normal human being and perhaps THEN the storyline will make better sense.  Otherwise the acting is decent, and it's a pretty decent film overall.  No it's not a typical ""Americans vs. Muslims"" type of storyline, but that doesn't excuse the confusion mainly thanks to the woman who plays the lead character.  Again, we'll just assume it's the woman who's at fault the entire time and is actually the bad person, and that's the twist the movie writers were going for.  During a time when the average American didn't know how to approach the Muslim community, the film writers wanted to take the issue from a different angle and offer surprising twists and turns.  I believe this is the case with Sorry, Haters.  The only problem is, again, the confusing way the story is told.",3,sorry... didn't hate it but didn't like it either,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,3129,"['Sorry', 'Haters', 'really', 'twisted', 'take', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'Americans', 'Muslims', 'writing', 'review', 'let', 'state', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'overall', 'least', 'second', 'half', 'totally', 'went', 'head.What', 'initially', 'be', 'American', 'woman', 'revenge', 'short-sighted', 'attitude', 'problem', 'demanding', 'Muslim', 'cab', 'driver', 'take', 'wherever', 'go', 'willing', 'pay', 'guy', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'make', 'possible', 'soon', 'discover', 'storyline', 'much', 'deeper', 'Eventually', 'Muslim', 'temporary', 'stop', 'house', 'woman', 'small', 'child', 'woman', 'basically', 'communicate', 'how', 'terrible', 'United', 'States', 'learn', 'woman', 'child', 'are', 'family', 'cab', 'drivers', 'brother.Eventually', 'discussion', 'concerning', 'brother', 'important', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'woman', 'rationalize', 'carrying', 'decent', 'conversation', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'freeing', 'cab', 'drivers', 'brother', 'well', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'see', 'brother', 'talk', 'Second', 'storyline', 'different', 'WAY', 'more', 'confusing', 'direction', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'discover', 'woman', 'snuck', 'way', 'Muslims', 'belongings', 'somehow', 'took', '500', 'bucks', 'guy', 'Actually', 'right', 'would', 'seem', 'woman', 'set', 'up', 'perfect', 'trap', 'Muslim', 'could', ""n't"", 'escape', 'top', 'building', 'locking', 'there', 'nowhere', 'go', '-much', 'MY', 'surprise', 'least-', 'ends', 'up', 'giving', 'door', 'password', 'run', 'free', 'then', 'seen', 'streets', 'running', 'security', 'guards', 'here', 'out', 'discussion', 'brother', 'pushed', 'aside', 'missed', 'something', 'storyline', '*much*', 'worse', 'communication', 'woman', 'Muslim', 'never', 'really', 'fully', 'understood', 'very', 'end', 'even', 'THEN', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'other', 'woman', 'psychotic', 'tendencies', 'had', 'Muslim', 'guy', 'completely', 'spell', 'entire', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'what', '*very*', 'end', 'though-', 'two', 'surprises', 'actually', 'are', 'major', 'inappropriate', 'spoil', 'readers.Overall', 'well', 'just', 'understand', 'woman', 'mental', 'issues', 'not', 'capable', 'rationalizing', 'sympathizing', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'perhaps', 'THEN', 'storyline', 'will', 'make', 'better', 'sense', 'Otherwise', 'acting', 'decent', 'pretty', 'decent', 'film', 'overall', 'not', 'typical', 'Americans', 'vs.', 'Muslims', 'type', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'confusion', 'mainly', 'woman', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'Again', ""'ll"", 'just', 'assume', 'woman', 'who', 'fault', 'entire', 'time', 'actually', 'bad', 'person', 'twist', 'movie', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'time', 'when', 'average', 'American', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'approach', 'Muslim', 'community', 'film', 'writers', 'wanted', 'take', 'issue', 'different', 'angle', 'offer', 'surprising', 'twists', 'turns', 'believe', 'case', 'Sorry', 'Haters', 'only', 'problem', 'again', 'confusing', 'way', 'story', 'told']","Sorry, Haters"
997593,A1SP38JKYFFVJS,B000FZEU10,Caesar M. Warrington,"[18, 27]","Phoebe (Robin Wright Penn), a divorced and detached staffer for a New York based, MTV style music video network, longs for the mood and feeling of 9/11--most especially for the way her self-absorbed boss Phyllis (Sandra Oh) had relied on her for emotional support back then.  Trouble begins when Syrian-born cabdriver Ashade (actor/director Abdellatif Kechiche) picks up Phoebe and he tells her about his family's problems.  Phoebe starts deceiving Ashade, letting him think she can help get his innocent brother released from detention in Guantanamo.  After Ashade realizes Phoebe's mental instability and consequently distances himself from her, Phoebe turns ugly and plots revenge upon the Middle Easterner, and his French-Canadian sister-in-law (Eloise Bouchez), who is illegally resident in this country, as well.SORRY, HATERS actually could have been a good psychodrama if it wasn't such an arty and self-indulgent mess.  Being shot within in little over two weeks with a DV recorder, it stylistically has the feel of an amateur film posted on YouTube.  Robin Wright Penn seems very uncomfortable in her role, looking in several scenes as if she's saying ""What am I doing here?"" to herself.  Kechiche's lines are simply incomprehensible, mumbling in broken English and yelling in Arabic (while subtitles are provided for the Arabic dialogue, I suggest you activate your close captioning for whenever this guy speaks).  Moreover, Kechiche, a Tunisian, is seriously miscast; Syrians, like the Lebanese, have much Greek, Roman, and Armenian blood flowing through their veins, and are generally more fair-skinned than this actor (think of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad).  For some reason Americans--regardless of whichever end of the political spectrum they congregate--feel this need to stress the notion of color difference into our dealings with Muslims, despite those differences being slight and, for the most part, illusory.What is most disturbing, however, is the attempt SORRY, HATERS makes to force upon sane and rational viewers its message that we Americans are really the nihilistic predators and terrorizers.  As with many nowadays who are socially and politcally left-of-center, it wants for us to acknowledge our society's consumerist ambitions, in combination with increased emotional alienation and self-loathing, as something as hateful and destructive as any extreme Islamist ideology.Speaking of self-loathing, this movie's writer and director, Jeff Stanzler, is overwhelmed by it.  There is some major--albeit confused--contempt for the trendy and the 'progressive,' who, assumedly, inhabit Stanzler's personal and professional life.  Naturally, a man as devout as Ashade (who keeps to his ablutions and prayers under even the most stressful situations) doesn't merely enter into some sort of relationship with a strange middle-aged American woman, he also handles dogs, allows alcohol in his home  and, better yet, recognizes and supports his brother's kafir wife.  Yes, of course, we do have the gratuitous scene of thuggish Homeland Security agents copping cheap feels (naturally) off of Ashade's homely sister-in-law after she passes out from interrogation.  But it's those characters and types, otherwise often favorably portrayed in independent films such as this, which are the real targets of Stanzler's disdain:  Phoebe's boss, Phyllis MacIntyre, the head of a major cable music channel, is married to a slight and diminutive house husband, complete with downy beard and a moptop of hair.  Stanzler shows Phyllis to be mercenary and a narcissist, producing violent, expletive-ridden rap videos, but whose top rated program, ""Sorry, Haters,"" a CRIBS-style reality show that glorifies the ghetto fabulous and all things crass and materialistic.  Most poignant of all, however, is the type of woman that is Phoebe herself.  While Phoebe is portrayed as a successful middle-aged professional, she is also emotionally stunted; a woman who compensates for her ex-husband having full custody of their daughter by doting over her little lapdog and yearning to recapture that moment when Phyllis (who Phoebe despises otherwise) was afraid that the terrorists were coming to get her next and looked to her for security and comfort.  Such women once represented the feminist ideal, but Stanzler reduces them to parodies, making it seem as if they are symptomatic of the West's decadence and dysfunction that is polluting the rest of the world. He also seems to be saying that it is from women such as these that men such as Ashade or even the 9/11 hijackers must struggle against with their pious purity.  Such sentiments are a disgrace and are as spit in the face of every New Yorker who suffered through that day, regardless of whatever their lifestyles or politics.  Others may wonder what it would take to make a Jeff Stanzler understand the trauma and loss of that day.  Unfortunately, the Jeff Stanzlers of this country do understand, and they just don't care.Now about the little dog...Stanzler makes a really cheap shot at the very end with that little pooch.  While it is quite unlikely, if I ever come across the man he's got a slap to the back of his head coming from me over the sick finale to this sorry mess of a movie, which stinks worse than a well used port-a-potty on a summer's hottest day.",1,A Sorry Mess,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,5332,"['Phoebe', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'divorced', 'detached', 'staffer', 'New', 'York', 'based', 'MTV',

We will presume him to be innocent, but the cab driver is certain he is innocent and only wants to help his brother. He doesn't hate America in spite of what has happened.A woman gets into his cab, clearly upset about her own personal issues. She asks to be driven downtown and has the cab driver park outside a house where she cries when she sees a man, woman, and child arriving home. She keys the car, and then shows the cab driver a picture of the man, woman, and child, with herself. She says she is a producer of Reality TV Shows, like ""Sorry, Haters,"" a show that displays the lavish lifestyles of rappers to induce envy in viewers. Her husband is an artist, and the woman is their nanny; but she and her husband are estranged, and he is now with the nanny.The cab driver is anxious to get home, as he needs to bring some money to his brother's wife. She is not ready to go home. He will drive her around, but needs to make a quick stop. As he is talking to his brother's wife, she barges in and intrudes on their life. On hearing about his brother's plight, she offers to try to get him a lawyer, but instead she steals the money he has saved to help him. His situation goes from bad to worse. He goes back to her office to find out why she pretended to want to help him, but then went about trying to destroy him.The film doesn't really answer this riddle, but we do learn that Phoebe was not really who she said she was. She has more baggage than a sky cap the day before Thanksgiving. The tag for this film was: The dust has finally settled... for most of us. It delves into the anxieties and fears we have in a post 9/11 America, and also tackles the equally perplexing problems of loneliness, alienation, and mental illness. The film seems prescient about certain events like the arrest of Jihad Jane.This indie film was shot in 15 days and takes on many complex and troubling issues.

In a movie full of twists and turns, Penn has us going as a high-powered exec, then a lowly number-cruncher, followed by a psycho terrorist, then suddenly she is a vulnerable sweatheart on the verge of redemption, followed by a cold-blooded psychopath.  Sybil cannot compete with Robin Wright Penn; and that is giving away too much.  To enjoy the full effect of the movie, it is better to take it at face value and just follow along to be astounded by the depth of disturbance that 9/11 could create in one individual.So we're five years on from 9/11 now.  Big Hollywood is coming out with its exploitation flicks.  Having seen none of the forthcoming productions, I will reserve judgement, but did Nick Cage really need to go there?  What we have in ""Sorry, Haters"" is something far more personal and downstream, a really complex  9/11 ramification that somehow transmogrifies a victim into a victimizer.

The movie is helped considerably by excellent supporting roles, Abdellatif Kechiche and Sandrah Oh shine in a tightly scripted nail-biter.",4,Completely Duped,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1344,"['Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'very', 'much', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'rare', 'vintage', 'wine', 'savor', 'what', 'little', 'get', 'movie', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'Penn', 'going', 'high-powered', 'exec', 'then', 'lowly', 'number-cruncher', 'followed', 'psycho', 'terrorist', 'then', 'suddenly', 'vulnerable', 'sweatheart', 'verge', 'redemption', 'followed', 'cold-blooded', 'psychopath', 'Sybil', 'can', 'not', 'compete', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'enjoy', 'full', 'effect', 'movie', 'better', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'just', 'follow', 'along', 'be', 'astounded', 'depth', 'disturbance', '9/11', 'could', 'create', 'one', 'individual.So', ""'re"", 'five', 'years', '9/11', 'now', 'Big', 'Hollywood', 'coming', 'out', 'exploitation', 'flicks', 'Having', 'seen', 'none', 'forthcoming', 'productions', 'will', 'reserve', 'judgement', 'did', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'really', 'need', 'go', 'there', 'What', 'have', 'Sorry', 'Haters', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'personal', 'downstream', 'really', 'complex', '9/11', 'ramification', 'somehow', 'victim', 'victimizer', 'film', 'final', 'twist', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'unnecessary', 'least', 'writer/director', 'was', 'able', 'one-up', 'savvy', 'audience', 'went', 'places', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'movie', 'helped', 'considerably', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Abdellatif', 'Kechiche', 'Sandrah', 'Oh', 'shine', 'tightly', 'scripted', 'nail-biter']","Sorry, Haters"

Robin Wright Penn has her moments in this film, and those moments are pretty creepy. However, this film was entirely unfocused and awkward at times, and while it attempted to be unique and original, this subject matter has been explored before in other films...and with much better results, I might add. The ending is one BIG cliche.

997608,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000FZEU10,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 2]","All the verbiage about muslims and Americans and the whole decadent American culture vs. Good Muslims is really secondary which is actually quite surprising. You get the feeling that the movie was banking on the Muslim/American cultural clash in order to sell itself to a post-9/11 world but the heart of the story is classic femme fatale noir and it pretty much rises and falls on that basic story.A cab driver picks up a really mean looking woman played by Robin Wright Penn. From the outset, you can tell that's something is wrong with her. She isn't smiling. She's making the cab driver go to New Jersey. She's giving the classic line about ""I'll pay you the total of whatever you made last night"" which Tom Cruise used inCollateral (Two-Disc Special Edition). Meanwhile the cab driver is presented as a good guy who prays regularly and works hard for his extended family.The political stuff comes pretty hard when Robin Wright Penn invades the cab driver's home to drink wine and complain about how she's working for an MTV Reality Show called ""Sorry, Haters"" which features a lot of rich people being ugly rich. She wants him to pull a terrorist attack. He wants to get his brother out of jail and immigrate. She's all full of hatred for America and he's a goodhearted muslim who might have problems but he's basically patriotic even when the cops haul his sister-in-law away and impound his cab based on an anonymous tip from Penn.However, the political material cannot sustain the story. The meat of the story is Robin Wright Penn trying to use the muslim cab driver to carry out her agenda and manipulating him all along the way. And here's where things start to go south. Robin Wright Penn is pretty good as the perpetually frowning crabby woman who seems to hate everything but she's too good at playing this unpleasant creep. So good that you wonder how ANYONE could be roped in by her stories and lies. All noir movies with femme fatales tend to have stupid men who get messed up by evil women, but the cab driver character is so stupid that you just can't really sympathize.At first, you can give him the benefit of the doubt. Sure, when she has him drive her all the way to New Jersey to vandalize a car and then drive off, he might be innocent. Hell, when she yells at him for claiming that he made $160 the previous night and that it's clearly a lie, he might be that desperate for a fare that he will let a horrible creep bully him. Of course, I paid a cab driver $30 to take me from Midtown to Washington Heights and that trip took him 20 minutes tops so I don't see why a cabbie can't make 160.And then it gets even lamer. She keeps claiming that she's calling her lawyer even though it's obvious that it's after midnight and he's never going to pick up. When he stops at his house and leaves her in the cab, she comes in and starts drinking and complaining. He goes back to her office with her and listens to her complain even more. Even when she steals all of his money and gets caught lying about her entire identity he's still willing to believe her. By the end, he's gone from an innocent muslim to the stupidest man in the world. You kind of think that he's going to turn the tables on her and he almost looks like he's going to do that for a second, but then he goes back and trusts that she's really changed now.Noir movies have their same beats but they work because we believe that we can be in this situation; but no one can be as stupid as this cab driver. And that kills the movie.",2,Robin Wright Penn is pretty good as one of the most unpleasant characters in fiction - the rest not so much,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,3514,"['verbiage', 'muslims', 'Americans', 'whole', 'decadent', 'American', 'culture', 'vs.', 'Good', 'Muslims', 'really', 'secondary', 'actually', 'quite', 'surprising', 'get', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'banking', 'Muslim/American', 'cultural', 'clash', 'order', 'sell', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'heart', 'story', 'classic', 'femme', 'fatale', 'noir', 'pretty', 'much', 'rises', 'falls', 'basic', 'story.A', 'cab', 'driver', 'up', 'really', 'mean', 'looking', 'woman', 'played', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'outset', 'can', 'tell', 'something', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'smiling', 'making', 'cab', 'driver', 'go', 'New', 'Jersey', 'giving', 'classic', 'line', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'total', 'made', 'last', 'night', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'used', 'inCollateral', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Meanwhile', 'cab', 'driver', 'presented', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'regularly', 'hard', 'extended', 'family.The', 'political', 'stuff', 'pretty', 'hard', 'when', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'cab', 'driver', 'home', 'drink', 'wine', 'complain', 'how', 'working', 'MTV', 'Reality', 'Show', 'called', 'Sorry', 'Haters', 'lot', 'rich', 'people', 'being', 'ugly', 'rich', 'pull', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'get', 'brother', 'jail', 'immigrate', 'full', 'hatred', 'America', 'goodhearted', 'muslim', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'problems', 'basically', 'patriotic', 'even', 'when', 'cops', 'haul', 'sister-in-law', 'away', 'impound', 'cab', 'based', 'anonymous', 'tip', 'Penn.However', 'political', 'material', 'can', 'not', 'sustain', 'story', 'meat', 'story', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'trying', 'use', 'muslim', 'cab', 'driver', 'carry', 'out', 'agenda', 'manipulating', 'way', 'here', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'south', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'pretty', 'good', 'perpetually', 'frowning', 'crabby', 'woman', 'who', 'hate', 'everything', 'too', 'good', 'playing', 'unpleasant', 'creep', 'So', 'good', 'wonder', 'how', 'ANYONE', 'could', 'be', 'roped', 'stories', 'lies', 'noir', 'movies', 'femme', 'fatales', 'tend', 'have', 'stupid', 'men', 'who', 'get', 'messed', 'up', 'evil', 'women', 'cab', 'driver', 'character', 'so', 'stupid', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'sympathize.At', 'first', 'can', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'Sure', 'when', 'drive', 'way', 'New', 'Jersey', 'vandalize', 'car', 'then', 'drive', 'off', 'might', 'be', 'innocent', 'Hell', 'when', 'claiming', 'made', '160', 'previous', 'night', 'clearly', 'lie', 'might', 'be', 'desperate', 'fare', 'will', 'let', 'horrible', 'creep', 'bully', 'course', 'paid', 'cab', 'driver', '30', 'take', 'Midtown', 'Washington', 'Heights', 'trip', 'took', '20', 'minutes', 'tops', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'cabbie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', '160.And', 'then', 'even', 'lamer', 'claiming', 'calling', 'lawyer', 'even', 'obvious', 'midnight', 'never', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'When', 'house', 'cab', 'starts', 'drinking', 'complaining', 'back', 'office', 'complain', 'even', 'more', 'Even', 'when', 'money', 'caught', 'lying', 'entire', 'identity', 'still', 'willing', 'believe', 'end', 'gone', 'innocent', 'muslim', 'stupidest', 'man', 'world', 'kind', 'think', 'going', 'turn', 'tables', 'almost', 'going', 'do', 'second', 'then', 'back', 'trusts', 'really', 'changed', 'now.Noir', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'beats', 'work', 'believe', 'can', 'be', 'situation', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'stupid', 'cab', 'driver', 'movie']","Sorry, Haters"
