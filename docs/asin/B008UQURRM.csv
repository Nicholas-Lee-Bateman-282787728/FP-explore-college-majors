It is presented in a hilarious awards-show format, with different characters presenting the different awards. The antics of Sarge, Sister, Church, Caboose, and many others keep it funny, while also paying tribute to the epic moments of this spectacular series. So go ahead and pick this up, it's a steal for just $5.

You may be asking yourself, &#34;Why is it here?&#34;I already own all 10 seasons that are out now, but I bought it anyway. Only half of it is reruns, and a few things from the show are re-edited, like a Meta/Agent Maine epicness montage. Even though I've seen every season at least 3 times, I laughed like I was seeing the clips for the first time. However, very few clips from Season 9 made it in, and only one from season 10.The award ceremony scenes between clips are nothing short of hilarious, especially if you know the series as well as I do. If you don't know the series, it's a good way to get hooked, and it's only $5. Come on. Plus, it includes the obscure Grifball miniseries &#34;Expansion&#34; exclusive to Halo Waypoint and the Recollection DVD set from RoosterTeeth (Amazon and Best Buy versions don't have it).Anyway, it's a great way to introduce friends to the show, it's great if you have some or none of the DVDs, and it's great for die-hard fans like me. Buy it. And pick up some elbow grease and headlight fluid while you're at it.",5,"Even if you own all the seasons, get it.",1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,1114,"['Sup', 'Shisnos', 'already', 'released', '10', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'asking', '34', 'Why', 'here', '34', 'already', 'own', '10', 'seasons', 'are', 'out', 'now', 'bought', 'anyway', 'Only', 'half', 'reruns', 'few', 'things', 'show', 'are', 're-edited', 'Meta/Agent', 'Maine', 'epicness', 'montage', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'season', 'least', '3', 'times', 'laughed', 'was', 'seeing', 'clips', 'first', 'time', 'However', 'very', 'few', 'clips', 'Season', '9', 'made', 'only', 'one', 'season', '10.The', 'award', 'ceremony', 'scenes', 'clips', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'know', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'series', 'good', 'way', 'get', 'hooked', 'only', '5', 'Come', 'obscure', 'Grifball', 'miniseries', '34', 'Expansion', '34', 'exclusive', 'Halo', 'Waypoint', 'Recollection', 'DVD', 'set', 'RoosterTeeth', 'Amazon', 'Best', 'Buy', 'versions', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '.Anyway', 'great', 'way', 'introduce', 'friends', 'show', 'great', 'have', 'none', 'DVDs', 'great', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Buy', 'pick', 'up', 'elbow', 'grease', 'headlight', 'fluid', ""'re""]",The Best Red vs. Blue DVD.
