This season is over eight hours of Star Wars goodness. The characters get a digital makeover, making the animation more realistic, and some of the character designs make a departure from the original Genndy Tartakovsky-esque designs to a more Episode III-ish look. The Attack on Kamino, the &#34;Mortis&#34; arc where our three heroes attain a faint glimpse of the future(somewhat similar to the 2D Star Wars Clone  cartoon), and the return of old classics like Chewbacca and a younger Grand-Moff Tarkin are the highlight of the season and will please both young and old fans of the series.",5,My personal favorite.,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,689,"['Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'season', '3', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'up', 'epic', 'conclusion', 'season', '5', 'season', 'over', 'eight', 'hours', 'Star', 'Wars', 'goodness', 'characters', 'get', 'digital', 'makeover', 'making', 'animation', 'more', 'realistic', 'character', 'designs', 'make', 'departure', 'original', 'Genndy', 'Tartakovsky-esque', 'designs', 'more', 'Episode', 'III-ish', 'look', 'Attack', 'Kamino', '34', 'Mortis', '34', 'arc', 'where', 'three', 'heroes', 'attain', 'faint', 'glimpse', 'future', 'somewhat', 'similar', '2D', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Clone', 'cartoon', 'return', 'old', 'classics', 'Chewbacca', 'younger', 'Grand-Moff', 'Tarkin', 'are', 'highlight', 'season', 'will', 'please', 'young', 'old', 'fans', 'series']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars:S3 Box (DVD)

I understand Lucas caught alot of flack about Darth Maul dying but trying to make up for it by bringing in his brother, please cut it out. I know many mistakes were made in the prequels but Clone Wars has made up for it. Season three tries to make up for the prequels too much, but who cares about those movies anymore.

And for those of you who don't, this won't be a visual review as I'm totally blind and have been since birth.  But stick around anyway and explore Lucas' masterpiece via my unique perspective.There have been several SW fans who haven't really enjoyed the first half of this particular season.  They complained that a number of the episodes were too political.  I felt that way when they aired, but once I watched them in chronological order, I had a vast difference of opinion.  For one thing, the 3 or so political episodes focus on what Palpatine is doing behind the scenes.  That's always a joy to watch.  It's also a joy to listen to in my case since I think the late great Ian Aberkromby gave us a magnificent Palpatine.  So give these another shot, folks.What can I say about this series?  I'm guessing you probably already own the first 2 seasons if you're reading this.  You've undoubtedly seen this as well.  So I should probably tell you a few of my favorite episodes and let you buy this already.The first 2 that come to mind were the book-ends to a season 1 episode called Rookies.  I absolutely loved Clone Cadets and ARC Troopers. A very memorable clone named 99 stole the show, in my opinion.  He was certainly an example of an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things.Another favorite was Supply Lines.  That one contained some fantastic battle scenes, but then again most Clone Wars episodes do.  I also loved the Nightsisters Trilogy as well as the Chewbacca Duology/season finale.  the 3 or so episodes spotlighting bounty hunters Aura Sing and Cad Bane were also among my favorites. They include Assassin, Evil Plans, and Hunt for Zero.  Bane is so very ruthless and unpredictable, so you never know what he's going to do next. And the writers don't give Aura enough screen time, so it was great seeing her in Assassin. Here's hoping we see her in season 5 this Fall.The 3rd season was a great ride and can't wait for season 4 to be released on Oct 23rd this year.  I only wish the writers and cast would opt to do a few episode commentaries on these sets.  I bet the voice actors have allot to say.  It would be interesting to listen to people like Clancy Brown, Ashley Eckstein, and James Arnold Taylor tell us their reactions concerning key moments in certain episodes.  But it really isn't a big deal.  The DVD bonus features kept me entertained and the episodes were unforgettable.",5,Another great 22 episodes,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,2471,"['guys', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'reviews', 'know', 'drill', 'now', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'visual', 'review', ""'m"", 'totally', 'blind', 'have', 'been', 'birth', 'stick', 'around', 'anyway', 'explore', 'Lucas', 'masterpiece', 'unique', 'perspective.There', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'SW', 'fans', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'half', 'particular', 'season', 'complained', 'number', 'episodes', 'were', 'too', 'political', 'felt', 'way', 'when', 'aired', 'once', 'watched', 'chronological', 'order', 'had', 'vast', 'difference', 'opinion', 'one', 'thing', '3', 'so', 'political', 'episodes', 'focus', 'what', 'Palpatine', 'doing', 'scenes', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'also', 'joy', 'listen', 'case', 'think', 'late', 'great', 'Ian', 'Aberkromby', 'gave', 'magnificent', 'Palpatine', 'So', 'give', 'shot', 'folks.What', 'can', 'say', 'series', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'probably', 'already', 'own', 'first', '2', 'seasons', ""'re"", 'reading', ""'ve"", 'undoubtedly', 'seen', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'probably', 'tell', 'few', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'let', 'buy', 'already.The', 'first', '2', 'come', 'mind', 'were', 'book-ends', 'season', '1', 'episode', 'called', 'Rookies', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Clone', 'Cadets', 'ARC', 'Troopers', 'very', 'memorable', 'clone', 'named', '99', 'stole', 'show', 'opinion', 'was', 'certainly', 'example', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'doing', 'extraordinary', 'things.Another', 'favorite', 'was', 'Supply', 'Lines', 'one', 'contained', 'fantastic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'then', 'again', 'most', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'do', 'also', 'loved', 'Nightsisters', 'Trilogy', 'as', 'well', 'Chewbacca', 'Duology/season', 'finale', '3', 'so', 'episodes', 'spotlighting', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'Aura', 'Sing', 'Cad', 'Bane', 'were', 'also', 'favorites', 'include', 'Assassin', 'Evil', 'Plans', 'Hunt', 'Zero', 'Bane', 'so', 'very', 'ruthless', 'unpredictable', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'Aura', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'Assassin', 'Here', 'hoping', 'see', 'season', '5', 'Fall.The', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'ride', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '4', 'be', 'released', 'Oct', '23rd', 'year', 'only', 'wish', 'writers', 'cast', 'would', 'opt', 'do', 'few', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'sets', 'bet', 'voice', 'actors', 'have', 'allot', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'listen', 'people', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'Ashley', 'Eckstein', 'James', 'Arnold', 'Taylor', 'tell', 'reactions', 'concerning', 'key', 'moments', 'certain', 'episodes', 'really', ""n't"", 'big', 'deal', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'kept', 'entertained', 'episodes', 'were', 'unforgettable']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars:S3 Box (DVD)

1413422,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B004LROMT8,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[1, 3]","The animated TV show Star Wars The Clone Wars that has been running on Cartoon Network for four seasons has quietly been accomplishing what the three prequel films failed to do.After watching these episodes, I am actually left wondering if in fact those three films might have benefited from full animation, rather than the live action, stuffed-to-the-gills-with-computer-effects that struggled to seem real to the viewer. Several of the newer films failed to form a connection to the original three films. Sometimes animation lets the fantasy of a story seem more real than live action.Lucas obviously has a huge vision for the breadth and scope that is the Star Wars universe. Here in these short episodes, his vision--along with the help of many talented writers, artists, and visionaries--is allowed to play itself out. Every indulgence is satisfied as episode after episode delve into action, history, characters, humor, romance, betrayal, and the slow unfolding of Anakin into his eventual turn toward the dark side in Episode III.I have been more than a little surprised by the depth, gravity, and drama in what is essentially a kids' cartoon. The stories include genuine death scenes in which characters and soldiers are cut down and lost week after week. Gone are the days of G.I. Joe where every exploding ship ridiculously reveals a parachute where even the bad guys make it to safety. Droids, aliens, clones, and humans all lose their lives in what, when all is said and done, might turn out to be the finest Star Wars series ever produced. Characters' backstories are told in a way that a two-hour film would never allow. The funny thing is that it has been going on for years now and has become lost in the pop culture, over-saturated fizz of dozens of other shows that obscure this gem from getting the praise it deserves.For me, this show stands alongside some of the greatest sci-fi TV shows of all time.  I'll be happy to own all the complete seasons when this show runs its course and tells the complete bridge between Episodes II and III. By then, Lucas will have his next opus ready for consumption; the live action TV show that will bridge the long, dark period between Episode III and Episode IV. I can only hope that the live-action show manages to pull off what this show, so far, has been doing.I would also like to mention that the animation, art, background paintings, music, and voice acting, is all second to none. I've been continually pausing and admiring still shots from episodes to marvel at the beauty of this show as it plays itself out. When this show is done, Star Wars fans will have a 100-episode magnum opus to watch over and over. I hope a collectors' edition will eventually be released, as well as a comprehensive soundtrack. The subtlety contained in the music, especially for fans who know the original music well, is fantastic. Each season deserves a multi-disc release. Lucas may have botched the original trilogy in the three films that got consecutively better as they went on, but this series firmly establishes his legacy as the one and only father of Star Wars. It also shows that since he was smart enough to loosen the reigns on his baby and let talent take the helm, he can guide the series to the greatness is deserves.

1413424,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B004LROMT8,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[1, 3]","I won't lie, I am a serious Star Wars fan. I didn't see the orginal movies in the theaters (I did see the Remade ones that came out just before the prequel) We didn't have a lot of money, and when I could afford to go, it was hard to get anyone to take me anywhere. Long story short, I was a frustrated 7 year old. Well almost 7. I did however read the comic book tie-in to see what all the fuss was about. My brothers had all of the trading cards and I thought those were pretty cool. But, after reading the comics I was fascinated by the story. Eventually I got the book out of the library and read it, and I was hooked. Star Wars really does inspire the imagination. The classic themes of good vs. evil, the awesome jedi knights, even the older Obi Wan seemed cool and mysterious. It made you respect your elders even more, especially if they were wielding a light saber. That being said, there isn't anything negative I can say about Star Wars. Sure the tinkering Lucas does can be a bit frustrating, but I do love the improved special effects and some of the elements that tie the prequels into the originals. I didn't mind that Han shot first though. He was a bit of a rogue and a smartass, and I consider myself a professional smartass so I could relate. So when this series started I eagerly watched week after week as the story unfolded. The addition of Ahsoka was unexpected, but a great addition to the Star Wars Canon. Though, knowing what we know about the movies, we know Ahsoka isn't around, so there is a bit of sadness there. We know that Anakin's downfall was because he couldn't stand to lose the ones he loved. And, Ahsoka is part of his new family. Long before he betrays his friends and succumbs to the dark side, we get to see the man before the myth. A lot of people hated episode I because Anakin was so young, but the idea behind Lucas story is that you get to see the evolution of the character, or the de-evolution. You get to see how someone who is basically good can become something else. Sometimes desire turns to shame. Sometimes you're so blinded by doing the right thing that you do the wrong thing. You worry about the worst happening that you end up causing it to happen in a self-fulfilling prophecy. We all know Darth Sidious was pulling the strings, but we get to see how that affects Anakin who would become the most feared person in the galaxy. I do not own Season 3 YET, I own the first two on blu ray and am working on getting money for the third. However this was a great season, and as each season progresses the storyline tends to be a bit darker and a bit more violent, but as another reviewer stated it's not overdone. However it does show the real consequences of war and the realities that come with it. This is a story that probably should be supervised by a parent, so that they can explain these changes. That isn't to say that it's not for children, but it will challenge them a bit. Most children are intelligent enough to know this is just a tv show, but will also love how the show doesn't talk down to them. The lessons that the characters learn can be translated into real life, things like loyalty,friendship, sacrifice and knowing when to ask for help and knowing that everyone has limitations. This can easily be applied to the lives of non-jedis watching the show. The storylines are intelligent and fun to watch, and the special effects/animation are ahead of its time. sometimes you forget you are even watching animation, which is a sign that you are watching a quality show. When you care about the characters the same way that you would live actors playing the characters, that's the sign that you are watching great animation. I am glad this show is still on. I hope it is on for a while longer. But, with animation four years is a long time. Aside from the simpsons, animated shows usually do not last that long, but hopefully Lucas and his team have enough patience/time and money (though I'm sure he has enough money) to keep it going awhile longer. I get the feeling they do not want to end it too fast. They want the story to progress and the characters realised. That makes for good storytelling, and makes the end tragedy both anticipated and forboding. We all know what's going to happen in the end, but it's fun to see how they get there.

Yes, the one or two behind the scenes shows per disc is cool.  Let's talk packaging.  No sketchbook?  Really?  With all the cool characters, planets, droids and ships in the season, there should have been a crap-ton of artwork.  But no, blah packaging.Now to the season.  This series gets better by the season.  Yes, it gets a little dark in the back half of the season, but it's good stuff.  We flesh out the Ventress character as well as, to an extent, Darth Maul.  I waded through the one star reviews to get a feel for why people gave such a low rating.  All but one was about the lack of goodies.  One rather intrigued me.  While I respect everyones opinion, and their right to said opinion, I don't agree with it.  I felt it was the right time to tell the NightSisters story.  You need a little variety outside of the politics story and battle story.  More went on than strictly ""Clone"" and ""War"" and ""Political intrigue"" stories.  I also liked the series about Anakin being the Chosen One.  The season as a whole was very strong; I just thought the second half was stronger than the previous two seasons back 11 episodes.  They do get perhaps slightly less kid friendly than the other episodes, but at its heart this is a kids series so they aren't going to be too intense.  I think where maybe the reviewer had a problem is that it isn't ""typical"" Star Wars.  But, I digress.I can't say too much that is bad about this season.  I liked it more than the previous two, which is saying something as I loved the first two seasons.  It only gets 4 stars since there isn't artwork included as with the other seasons.

Rather, the political episodes were a great way to give Padme some character development and show her relationship with Bail Organa. had several epic trilogies which allowed the show to tell longer, more intense stories. The Savage Opress arc was a fan favorite and focus almost exclusively on Asajj Ventress and Savage Opress. The Mortis trilogy was another brilliant episode that delved into mythic archetypes. These were some of the best episodes of the season. Finally, Season 3 had more familiar faces from the Original Trilogy, particularly Tarkin and Chewbacca.

The writing and character development was very good. It ""fixed"" my perceived error of off Darth Maul too quickly in Episode One. It also answered questioned from Ziro jailbreak that I thought ended rather abruptly earlier in the show. The writers also developed a few more of the Clone Troopers that we see somewhat regularly on the show. We got to see a young Chewbacca. This season really fleshed out the universe and added some depth to it.It also seemed that the Force played a more central role in the Jedi and Sith characters. However, the central role of the Force and the Prophecy of the Chosen One lead to my least favorite episodes of the Mortis Trilogy.

However, the last half REALLY picks up pace and even contains on of the best story arcs of all seasons so far with The ""Witches of Mist"" trilogy. The finale introduces Chewbacca into the mix in a double-length episode. I only wish it came earlier. All-in-all a good season that could have been GREAT if the first half focused more on the Jedi, Clones and villains and less on politics, 3rd-tier characters and stuff nobody cares about.This Blu-Ray contains the same top-notch quality (top scores for 1080p video and 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio) as seasons 1 & 2, however the packaging has changed for the worse. (I deduct 1 star for packaging, 1 for a boring first half, but add one back for an EXCELLENT last half.)The 22 Episodes, over 3 disks, are:(1) Clone Cadets (2) ARC Troopers (3) Supply Lines (4) Sphere of Influence (5) Corruption (6) The Academy (7) Assassin(8) Evil Plans (9) Hunt For Ziro (10) Heroes on Both Sides (11) Pursuit of Peace (12) Nightsisters (13) Monster (14) Witches of the Mist(15)Overlords (16) Altar of Mortis (17) Ghosts of Mortis (18) The Citadel (19) Counterattack (20) Citadel Rescue (21) Padawan Lost (22) Wookiee HuntAll episodes are presented in widescreen with English, Spanish and French 5.1 DTS audio and English, French and Spanish subtitles. The disks are all REGION FREE, so will play in any country.Bonus features include:* Creating Kamino* Hutts and the Underworld* Witches and Monsters* Secrets of Mortis* Chewbacca Returns* Blu-ray Exclusive -- The Jedi Temple Archives: An extensive database exploring special effects footage, early concept art, 3D character and object turnarounds, early animation and more than 30 deleted/extended scenes. The Archives is a rare look at the assets in various stages of creation for The Clone Wars, with a wealth of surprises and never-before seen moments sprinkled throughoutRecommended if you love Star Wars, but be prepared for a few episodes of political talk and some uninteresting story lines.

Some people have complained about the Cgi animation for the characters finding them to cartoonish,  but I have never had a problem with this animation as regardless if the characters don't look to realistic or not they still entertain you throughout the series.  The voice cast and action of the series keeps you entertained but somewhat frustrated as we now have to wait until the next season for us to add to our collection,  many people have wondered how long the show is going to run until it catches up to the Episode III time era of the star wars franchise.

1413474,A26TTBH1QNCVSF,B004LROMT8,Some Guy,"[0, 0]","The Clone Wars is a wonderful series. Okay, now that I've said that I'll just jump right into my review of the third season.Of the three seasons that have been aired and are now currently available for purchase, this is the weakest but at the same time the strongest. Now, how can this be?  Well let me start by saying the series takes off on a very strong note.  We are reintroduced to the clone rookies from season 1 and given an interesting look at the training future clone troopers go through.  This episode called Clone Cadets is a great opener as it takes us back to the beginning of the war.  It adds more depth to the clone trooper as an individual.  In this episode we see the young cadets struggling to prove themselves to the ARC Commanders and their own instructors.  We are also introduced to Jedi Master Shaak Ti which is cool.  The second episode returns to the present and dishes up a Sep attack on Kamino! The third episode is good and the ones up to 12 are good but they are the reason I do not give this season 5 stars.  I felt that these episodes while interesting detracted from the action that drives the Clone Wars as a series.  Ep 4-12 are largely concerned with Senate matters and while intersparsed with some excitement are not what I expected.  The first and second seasons were consistent with keeping the show about the clones in the field and the Jedi leading them.  However a sizable chunk of the season turns our attention towards the political war fought in the senate. I understand that the battleground of politics and the one dominated by clones are related but the politics should not command the stage.  This series is meant to chronicle the struggle of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Jedi who reluctantly lead it.  I want to jump into the minds of the clones on the front lines.  On the subject of politics I find Padme to be naive and her views on how to end the war rather foolish.  One of my biggest gripes about this season is having to listen to her more often. Now I understand that this series is also aimed at children but when you look at the darker turns the series keeps taking you can see that it is looking to broaden its appeal.  This becomes quite apparent in episodes 12-22.  These episodes are the nuts and bolts of the Clone Wars and will please every viewer. Get ready for some familiar faces and some big surprises.So in conclusion let me say the third season is worth buying and worth watching over and over again.  It has its down point but recovers and makes up for lost action.

The reason I took off only one star for this and not two is because it's a perfectly fine set compared to any other show out there, and it does come with a nice enough slip cover, but it's hard not to be disappointed after being spoiled by the previous two digibook cases, so it still loses one star.Once I got over the fact that the case is about 20% less cool than the other season sets that I own, it's overall a very good release. The episodes in this season are a little confusing since they are in broadcast order instead of chronological order, and some of these episodes actually take place during Season 2! Even though the fanboys haven't yet figured out the correct viewing order for this season, the story arcs here are at least good, and there are some great cameos this season that the fans will love. Some famed characters from the movies make their animation debut, and even the titular heroes from the video game ""Republic Commando"" get an appearance. The transfer quality is top-notch as always, and if you've been collecting the show on Blu-Ray this is obviously a must buy.",4,"Good quality transfer, but WHERE'S MY DIGIBOOK!?",1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,1379,"['own', 'digibook', 'versions', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Lucasfilm', 'decided', 'release', 'Season', '3', 'only', 'regular-case', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'release', 'season', 'digibook', 'just', 'sucked', 'up', 'bought', 'anyway', 'reason', 'took', 'off', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'not', 'two', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'set', 'compared', 'other', 'show', 'there', 'come', 'nice', 'enough', 'slip', 'cover', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'being', 'spoiled', 'previous', 'two', 'digibook', 'cases', 'still', 'one', 'star.Once', 'got', 'fact', 'case', '20', '%', 'less', 'cool', 'other', 'season', 'sets', 'own', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'release', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'little', 'confusing', 'are', 'broadcast', 'order', 'instead', 'chronological', 'order', 'episodes', 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'Season', '2', 'Even', 'fanboys', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'figured', 'out', 'correct', 'viewing', 'order', 'season', 'story', 'arcs', 'here', 'are', 'least', 'good', 'are', 'great', 'cameos', 'season', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'famed', 'characters', 'movies', 'make', 'animation', 'debut', 'even', 'titular', 'heroes', 'video', 'game', 'Republic', 'Commando', 'get', 'appearance', 'transfer', 'quality', 'top-notch', 'always', ""'ve"", 'been', 'collecting', 'show', 'Blu-Ray', 'obviously', 'must', 'buy']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars:S3 Box (DVD)

So guess what.  You are into deep at this point.  You have to buy it.  Otherwise you shoulda cut yourself off after the season one.  That's why I bought it.  Trust me.  You won't be disappointed.  The show keeps getting better.  Watch it and love it.  But it's not about the decision of whether or not to purchase this.  It's going to come down to buying it now or waiting for the price to go down and holding off til the entire series is in a bulk packaging.  As for that dilemma I can't advise one way or the other.  Either way it's still keeping me up at night over what's going to happen to Ashoka.  I mean, the audacity for Lucas to bring out that incredible character when we all know it ain't ending well for her; not by one shot at all.  Something bad is going to bring her life to a fast end.  And Lucas put her out there for us to all love her knowing we'd have to deal with the shared dread knowing that she won't even last to the beginning of the Return of the Sith.  And if the show producers cheat and have her get exiled to safety in some far flung outpost ala Kenobi then they will have betrayed what we have emotionally invested in her.",5,Do what must be done,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,1280,"['point', 'are', 'contemplating', 'not', 'buy', 'then', 'am', 'just', 'going', 'assume', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'first', 'two', 'So', 'guess', 'what', 'are', 'deep', 'point', 'have', 'buy', 'Otherwise', 'shoulda', 'cut', 'off', 'season', 'one', 'why', 'bought', 'Trust', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'show', 'getting', 'better', 'Watch', 'love', 'not', 'decision', 'not', 'purchase', 'going', 'come', 'down', 'buying', 'now', 'waiting', 'price', 'go', 'down', 'holding', 'off', 'til', 'entire', 'series', 'bulk', 'packaging', 'dilemma', 'ca', ""n't"", 'advise', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'way', 'still', 'keeping', 'up', 'night', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Ashoka', 'mean', 'audacity', 'Lucas', 'bring', 'out', 'incredible', 'character', 'when', 'know', 'ai', ""n't"", 'ending', 'well', 'not', 'one', 'shot', 'Something', 'bad', 'going', 'bring', 'life', 'fast', 'end', 'Lucas', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'love', 'knowing', ""'d"", 'have', 'deal', 'shared', 'dread', 'knowing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'last', 'beginning', 'Return', 'Sith', 'show', 'producers', 'cheat', 'have', 'get', 'exiled', 'safety', 'far', 'flung', 'outpost', 'ala', 'Kenobi', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'betrayed', 'what', 'have', 'emotionally', 'invested']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars:S3 Box (DVD)
