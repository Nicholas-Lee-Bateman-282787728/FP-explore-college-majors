1614625,A1OO7OYL4XMA5F,B00AOCDDDK,"C. Harmon ""animal lover""","[5, 9]","I have loved horses since I knew what the word 'horse' meant.  I am 63 yrs old and have not been without a horse since I got my first pony for my 11th birthday.  I've loved them, ridden them for pleasure and exhibited them in horse shows.  WHY, oh WHY can't directors, producers and screen writers make a movie about horses that is realistic??????  For those who would comment that this is a movie about a family sticking together in difficult times, I say it IS.  But it could have been made just as effectively with total realism about horses.  Yet they have a man and his daughter capturing what is supposedly a wild stallion (a STALLION, yet!!) and completely training him to compete in a race that will occur in 2 weeks...2 WEEKS!!!  That's completely implausible!!!  The movie could have had the same uplifting theme using a time frame of at least a year and not a meager 2 weeks to train this WILD stallion for a race.Another total escape from reality is a rich, snobby banker trying to buy the stallion because the horse is so fast he could, perhaps, be raced in the Preakness or the Kentucky Derby!!!  PLEASE!!!  The only breed of horse allowed to run in any of these races is a Thoroughbred registered by the Jockey Club.  You know... a horse like Man O' War, Seabiscuit, Secretariat, War Admiral, etc.......And the ending almost had me wanting to pass out.  Selfish, greedy, wealthy people who try to use and abuse everyone do NOT suddenly become all 'warm and fuzzy' as these people did.The scenery WAS beautiful as were the horses, but the poor acting and completely unrealistic horse aspect negated all of the positives.  I bought the damn thing and wish I had my money back.  Even more, I wish I could have my Saturday night back:  I wasted 91 minutes of my life with this......",2,"Not realistic, at all...",1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,1793,"['have', 'loved', 'horses', 'knew', 'what', 'word', 'meant', 'am', '63', 'yrs', 'old', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'horse', 'got', 'first', 'pony', '11th', 'birthday', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'ridden', 'pleasure', 'exhibited', 'horse', 'shows', 'WHY', 'oh', 'WHY', 'ca', ""n't"", 'directors', 'producers', 'screen', 'writers', 'make', 'movie', 'horses', 'realistic', 'who', 'would', 'comment', 'movie', 'family', 'sticking', 'together', 'difficult', 'times', 'say', 'IS', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'just', 'effectively', 'total', 'realism', 'horses', 'have', 'man', 'daughter', 'capturing', 'what', 'supposedly', 'wild', 'stallion', 'STALLION', 'yet', 'completely', 'training', 'compete', 'race', 'will', 'occur', '2', 'weeks', '2', 'WEEKS', 'completely', 'implausible', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'uplifting', 'theme', 'using', 'time', 'frame', 'least', 'year', 'not', 'meager', '2', 'weeks', 'train', 'WILD', 'stallion', 'race.Another', 'total', 'escape', 'reality', 'rich', 'snobby', 'banker', 'trying', 'buy', 'stallion', 'horse', 'so', 'fast', 'could', 'perhaps', 'be', 'raced', 'Preakness', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'PLEASE', 'only', 'breed', 'horse', 'allowed', 'run', 'races', 'Thoroughbred', 'registered', 'Jockey', 'Club', 'know', 'horse', 'Man', 'O', 'War', 'Seabiscuit', 'Secretariat', 'War', 'Admiral', 'etc', 'ending', 'almost', 'had', 'wanting', 'pass', 'out', 'Selfish', 'greedy', 'wealthy', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'use', 'abuse', 'everyone', 'do', 'NOT', 'suddenly', 'become', ""'warm"", 'fuzzy', 'people', 'did.The', 'scenery', 'WAS', 'beautiful', 'were', 'horses', 'poor', 'acting', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'horse', 'aspect', 'negated', 'positives', 'bought', 'damn', 'thing', 'wish', 'had', 'money', 'back', 'Even', 'more', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'Saturday', 'night', 'back', 'wasted', '91', 'minutes', 'life']",Midnight Stallion

1614627,AY3EENC2BGTGK,B00AOCDDDK,"M. G. Gagliano ""Maria""","[5, 6]","OK..completely predictable but so what.  I knew exactly what was going to happen through the entire movie within the first 18 minutes from beginning to end.  A family in financial trouble decide to try to save the farm by planting a new type of crop, one that makes more money on the market than their current one. They are wonderful parents who are utterly in love and supportive of each other. Their daughter is a good girl who helps out and will do whatever she can to pitch in. She also has the best manners ever.OK...so you are wondering where the beautiful Midnight black stallion on the cover comes in right?! Well, one day the father is riding to clear his head about the financial problems and his wife's idea about the new crop when he spots a stunning horse just prancing around in the wild.  He decides to try to catch the horse so he can enter a horse race and hopefully win a huge sum of money that would help his family.So, my thoughts, Kris Kristofferson who I am a huge fan of and if you have ever seen A Star is Born you would know why. He was beautiful looks like he should be playing the grandpa and not the father of this young girl however, I do love him so we will let the fact that I had a hard time understanding him. However, I am a fan of Miss Ferland who was in Eclipse, Cabin In The Woods, The Haunting Hour, Silent Hill and Kingdom Hospital and thought she was perfect as the good, cowboy hat wearing, horse riding daughter.It is a sweet movie. Even the teen relationship is sweet!  Great family movie full of inspiration and a reminder on how we should never give up!",3,Lovely shots of Canada and a beautiful Horse!
