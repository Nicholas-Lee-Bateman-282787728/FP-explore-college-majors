I love the &quot;Behind The Scenes&quot; Commentary Feature that comes with the DVD.I know that off-stage Margaret isn't &quot;funny&quot; 24/7 and that's okay, who is? If you like insightful comedy that has more to offer than a few laughs, this film is &quot;the one&quot;.All The Best Margaret!!!UPDATE:  Margaret's 3rd DVD &quot;Revolution&quot; is coming soon!!!  You can also get all 3 DVDs in a &quot;Margaret Cho Collection&quot; set for a great price!!!  Buy the set and give the other DVDs to friends!!!  Happy!!!

She talked a lot about not only the funny things that have happened in her life, but the serious things too. (Once in a while, it actually looks like she might cry) Someone once said, ""Comics are the most unhappy people on earth."" (or something to that effect.) Well, I don't know how true that is, but I do know that I really appreciated the fact that she could share bits of her life that were less than humorous.She talked about how the network made her lose so much weight (30 pounds in 2 weeks) that her kidneys just collapsed during rehearsal. She talked about how she didn't ""get it"" and that it took her a while to realize that she was ok just the way she was. (I was almost brought to tears on a couple of occasions.)On a lighter note, her stuff was hilarious! I loved when she said she slept with a woman on the gay cruise she was working on. Then, she thought to herself, ""Am I gay? Am I straight? Then, i realized: I'm just slutty!!!"" Also, a lot of her routine features her imitating her Korean born mother. I was rolling watching her facial expressions! At the very end, when she walks off the stage, I almost stopped it, cause I thought that it was over. But, she comes back for an encore, so don't stop the tape! This, in my opinion, is probably the best part! Her parents used to own a bookstore in San Francisco, and her mother discusses the gay porn with her daughter...Oh, if you haven't already guessed, she talks a lot about gay people in her jokes. Don't watch if you would be offended.I recommend this to all who love watching great comics!",5,Funny and full of feeling!,1035072000,"10 20, 2002",2002,1748,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'work', 'before', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'aside', 'what', 'read', 'reviews.She', 'different', 'other', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'have', 'seen', 'talked', 'lot', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'life', 'serious', 'things', 'too', 'Once', 'while', 'actually', 'might', 'cry', 'Someone', 'once', 'said', 'Comics', 'are', 'most', 'unhappy', 'people', 'earth', 'something', 'effect', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'true', 'do', 'know', 'really', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'could', 'share', 'bits', 'life', 'were', 'less', 'humorous.She', 'talked', 'how', 'network', 'made', 'lose', 'so', 'much', 'weight', '30', 'pounds', '2', 'weeks', 'kidneys', 'just', 'collapsed', 'rehearsal', 'talked', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'took', 'while', 'realize', 'was', 'ok', 'just', 'way', 'was', 'was', 'almost', 'brought', 'tears', 'couple', 'occasions', 'lighter', 'note', 'stuff', 'was', 'hilarious', 'loved', 'when', 'said', 'slept', 'woman', 'gay', 'cruise', 'was', 'working', 'Then', 'thought', 'herself', 'Am', 'gay', 'Am', 'straight', 'Then', 'i', 'realized', ""'m"", 'just', 'slutty', 'Also', 'lot', 'routine', 'imitating', 'Korean', 'born', 'mother', 'was', 'rolling', 'watching', 'facial', 'expressions', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'walks', 'off', 'stage', 'almost', 'stopped', 'cause', 'thought', 'was', 'over', 'back', 'encore', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'tape', 'opinion', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'parents', 'used', 'own', 'bookstore', 'San', 'Francisco', 'mother', 'gay', 'porn', 'daughter', 'Oh', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'guessed', 'lot', 'gay', 'people', 'jokes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'would', 'be', 'offended.I', 'recommend', 'who', 'love', 'watching', 'great', 'comics']",Margaret Cho - I'm the One That I Want VHS
666274,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005ML8S,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 2]","Comedian Margaret Cho brings SF Bay Area culture to the masses, giving bawdy, multiculti pansexualism a very funny, and very recognizable voice. Cho delves deep into the depressing details of her brush with mainstream fame, when the ABC television network cast her as The Star Of The First Asian-American Female Sitcom... and then proceeded to tear apart at the very identity it found so compelling. Meanwhile, she gets in all sorts of brilliant observations about Korean-American identity and the joys of being a big ole fruit fly. She's hella funny and very, very Bay Area.",5,Painfully hilarous,1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,575,"['Comedian', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'SF', 'Bay', 'Area', 'culture', 'masses', 'giving', 'bawdy', 'multiculti', 'pansexualism', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'recognizable', 'voice', 'Cho', 'deep', 'depressing', 'details', 'brush', 'mainstream', 'fame', 'when', 'ABC', 'television', 'network', 'cast', 'Star', 'First', 'Asian-American', 'Female', 'Sitcom', 'then', 'proceeded', 'tear', 'apart', 'very', 'identity', 'found', 'so', 'compelling', 'Meanwhile', 'sorts', 'brilliant', 'observations', 'Korean-American', 'identity', 'joys', 'being', 'big', 'ole', 'fruit', 'fly', 'hella', 'funny', 'very', 'very', 'Bay', 'Area']",Margaret Cho - I'm the One That I Want VHS

In a nutshell, she has verve, and she has COJONES!  Her jokes revolve around sex, admiration of gay men, racism and sexism...it's mostly the second that distinguishes her from most comics, who still tend to lean towards the homophobic side.Towards the end there is a bit of a confessional that flirts with self-pity and then syrupy self-help, but that's a small thing compared to the rest of this side-splitting movie.  I'm ordering a copy for my very ""proper"" sister, who more closely fits the impeccable Yuppy suburbanite Asian stereotype...will relish watching it again with her, to see all the squiriming but also the shocked laughter.",5,"groundbreaking, hilarious & subversive",1039910400,"12 15, 2002",2002,1023,"['Asian-American', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'Margaret', 'Chos', 'there', 'female', 'male', 'such', 'powerful', 'counterpoint', 'Model', 'Minority', 'stereotype', 'Asians', 'submissive', 'faceless', 'conformists', 'techno/corporate', 'coolies.There', 'doubt', 'lady', 'hilarious', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'just', 'comedic', 'gold', 'graphic', 'humor', 'acerbic', 'wit', 'devastating', 'nutshell', 'verve', 'COJONES', 'jokes', 'revolve', 'sex', 'admiration', 'gay', 'men', 'racism', 'sexism', 'mostly', 'second', 'most', 'comics', 'who', 'still', 'tend', 'lean', 'homophobic', 'end', 'bit', 'confessional', 'self-pity', 'then', 'syrupy', 'self-help', 'small', 'thing', 'compared', 'rest', 'side-splitting', 'movie', ""'m"", 'ordering', 'copy', 'very', 'proper', 'sister', 'who', 'more', 'closely', 'impeccable', 'Yuppy', 'suburbanite', 'Asian', 'stereotype', 'will', 'relish', 'watching', 'again', 'see', 'squiriming', 'also', 'shocked', 'laughter']",Margaret Cho - I'm the One That I Want VHS

It usually takes us 2 and a half hours to get through one viewing of her DVD  because we have to stop and rewind just to hear what we missed because we are laughing so hard,or just to replay a spot that is so incredibly funny.
