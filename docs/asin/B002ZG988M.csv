1306520,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B002ZG988M,AIROLF,"[72, 84]","This is the true story: In 19th century, people of Verona indicated a house as the residence of Juliet from William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" Later, in 1937, it became a tradition to go to Juliet's grave in Verona and leave Juliet a letter about one's love problems. In 1990s the amount of letters reached astronomical proportions and a group of volunteers, who call themselves ""Club di Giulietta,"" took it upon themselves to answer each and every letter that's left for Juliet.Enter Hollywood: A young woman named Sophie (played by Amanda Seyfried) on her pre-Honeymoon discovers a letter left unanswered since 1957 and decides to answer it. This sets in motion the entire movie and, lo and behold, the audience is following the film's characters through Italy's countryside in the search for one true love.""Letters to Juliet"" is a cute romantic comedy that has some pretty scenery and captures of Verona, Italy. The movie is rather unrealistic but in a nice, harmless way that makes the most critical of us smile. Although the film never transcends beyond the fairy-tale, it's a sugar-sweet movie that leaves a pleasant feeling.Amanda Seyfried struggles with the responsibility of carrying on a film as a leading lady and Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal is miscast as the fiance that never has time for Sophie.

1306531,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG988M,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 10]","There are certain films that just cannot overcome the obstacle set before them by the prose suggested on the outset of the film.  It is a gigantic hurtle to overcome, beings that it is something that can cause individuals to roll their eyes uncontrollably and get up to use the restroom even when they have no need to.  It will cause people to stare at their watches and make silent prayers to the movie gods for the film to just END.That obstacle is, quite simply, stupidity.In the end, that is the biggest problem to be found with `Letters to Juliet'.  It is problematically clich&eacute;d and predictable and, above all else, it is stupid.  It is preposterous, and to the point where it cannot rebound from its ridiculous developments.  There is absolutely nothing about this film that makes any sense, and because of that one is left simply NOT CARING about anyone involved.  I see a lot of positive reviews for this film (which baffles me) and they I read the reviews and see that many are taking a more sympathetic approach simple because this stars the glorious Vanessa Redgrave.  Don't get me wrong; I LOVE HER, and I strongly consider her one of the finest actresses we've ever had the pleasure of watching do anything.  Even at her ripe age, she is still delivering impeccable performances; and this is no exception.  If anything could have been capable of pulling this dud out of the mire it was Redgrave, and she truly was an inspired casting decision and she made the most of her every moment (I was rooting for her to get that sentimental Oscar nomination that some on the internet were talking about).  She is great; but sadly the rest of the film is far from it.So, quickly, here are my main issues...The dialog is soap operatic in that it doesn't even sound like real people would ever say these things.  The relationships between individuals has absolutely no shading; no truth.  Sophie and her boyfriend would never exist within the same circle, and their `non' relationship is an insult to the audience (they wouldn't have made it past date-one).  The relationship between Sophie and Charlie isn't any better...in fact his whole character was unbearable.  The `lovey' connotations heaped upon every sequence of events felt forced and unnatural, and the way that Sophie's past was explored felt extremely underdeveloped.  I mean, if you are going to throw that weight our way, at least have the decency to make it feel like more than a manipulative plot device.Sometimes predictable fairytale endings work, but in order to make the cheesy and upended ridiculousness of these kinds of films work you really need to WORK at it.  `Letters to Juliet' puts in no real effort and it shows.All hail Vanessa Redgrave, but next time put her in a better movie!",1,I got nothin'...,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,2769,"['are', 'certain', 'films', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'obstacle', 'set', 'prose', 'suggested', 'outset', 'film', 'gigantic', 'hurtle', 'overcome', 'beings', 'something', 'can', 'cause', 'individuals', 'roll', 'eyes', 'uncontrollably', 'get', 'up', 'use', 'restroom', 'even', 'when', 'have', 'need', 'will', 'cause', 'people', 'stare', 'watches', 'make', 'silent', 'prayers', 'movie', 'gods', 'film', 'just', 'END.That', 'obstacle', 'quite', 'simply', 'stupidity.In', 'end', 'biggest', 'problem', 'be', 'found', 'Letters', 'Juliet', 'problematically', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'predictable', 'else', 'stupid', 'preposterous', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'rebound', 'ridiculous', 'developments', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'sense', 'one', 'left', 'simply', 'NOT', 'CARING', 'anyone', 'involved', 'see', 'lot', 'positive', 'reviews', 'film', 'read', 'reviews', 'see', 'many', 'are', 'taking', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'approach', 'simple', 'glorious', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'LOVE', 'HER', 'strongly', 'consider', 'one', 'finest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'do', 'anything', 'Even', 'ripe', 'age', 'still', 'delivering', 'impeccable', 'performances', 'exception', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'capable', 'pulling', 'dud', 'mire', 'was', 'Redgrave', 'truly', 'was', 'inspired', 'casting', 'decision', 'made', 'most', 'moment', 'was', 'rooting', 'get', 'sentimental', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'internet', 'were', 'talking', 'great', 'sadly', 'rest', 'film', 'far', 'it.So', 'quickly', 'here', 'are', 'main', 'issues', 'dialog', 'soap', 'operatic', ""n't"", 'even', 'sound', 'real', 'people', 'would', 'ever', 'say', 'things', 'relationships', 'individuals', 'absolutely', 'shading', 'truth', 'Sophie', 'boyfriend', 'would', 'never', 'exist', 'same', 'circle', 'non', 'relationship', 'insult', 'audience', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'date-one', 'relationship', 'Sophie', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'better', 'fact', 'whole', 'character', 'was', 'unbearable', 'lovey', 'connotations', 'heaped', 'sequence', 'events', 'felt', 'forced', 'unnatural', 'way', 'Sophie', 'past', 'was', 'explored', 'felt', 'extremely', 'underdeveloped', 'mean', 'are', 'going', 'throw', 'weight', 'way', 'least', 'have', 'decency', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'manipulative', 'plot', 'device.Sometimes', 'predictable', 'fairytale', 'endings', 'work', 'order', 'make', 'cheesy', 'upended', 'ridiculousness', 'kinds', 'films', 'work', 'really', 'need', 'WORK', 'Letters', 'Juliet', 'real', 'effort', 'shows.All', 'hail', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'next', 'time', 'put', 'better', 'movie']",N/A

He is caught up in work-related matters, and Sophia happens upon the house of Juliet (of Shakespeare fame).  Women from all over the world go there and leave letters to Juliet, taped to the wall below her balcony.  Sophia is intrigued when she notices that a woman with a basket collects the letters.  Sophia follows her and she meets ""Juliet's secretaries.""  This group of women take the time to answer each letter.

If the script was well-written this would be less of a problem, but the screenwriters are in dire need of a concept I learned in freshman English -- show, don't tell, and for goodness sakes, make use of subtlety!  I shouldn't be able to guess the entire plot of the movie based on the first 15 minutes...

1306556,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG988M,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","It's amazing how movies work on people. ""Letters to Juliet"" is a contrived, mushy, predictable story of love and romance, and yet it thoroughly won me over. This is strange given the fact that I'm usually so critical of romances, especially if they're trying to be funny. But unlike the desperate comedy of films like ""My Life in Ruins,"" ""27 Dresses,"" and the newly released ""The Back-Up Plan,"" this movie keeps its humor low key, reserving it for only such moments that it's actually needed. On the same token, it doesn't go for the needlessly weepy melodrama of movies like ""Dear John"" and ""The Last Song,"" both based Nicholas Sparks tearjerkers; it's all rather sweet and charming and fun, a nice way to spend 101 minutes away from the house, especially if you're with a date.The story begins in New York City, where Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a young fact checker for ""The New Yorker,"" dreams of becoming a featured writer. She's engaged to a developing chef named Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), who seems pleasant enough but is really more interested in micromanaging the opening of a new restaurant than in spending time with his bride to be. They travel to Verona on what was supposed to be a pre-honeymoon but, for Victor, ended up becoming a scouting mission for the best wines, olive oils, and truffles. The pre-honeymoon idea is enough of a red flag, I think. Honestly, who actually goes on something called a ""pre-honeymoon""?For Sophie, it becomes the perfect opportunity to write a story for her magazine. One day, she happens upon the house where Juliet Capulet is said to have lived and watches as emotional women from all over the world post relationship letters to a stone wall. She then becomes involved with a group of women who collect the letters and respond to them one by one. They call themselves Juliet's Secretaries, which, if you ask me, is actually a cute name. Entirely by accident, Sophie discovers a letter from 1957, written by a love-struck but frightened girl named Claire who left her beloved behind and returned home to England. Sophie is touched and decides to write back, apparently confident that, after a period of over fifty years, Claire still lives at the same address.As it turns out, this is the case. A few days later, Sophie is approached by Claire's grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan), a cold and bitter young man who disapproves of what Sophie has done. Because of her reply, his grandmother has returned to Verona and is on a quest to find her lost love - an utterly foolish idea if there ever was one. Undaunted, Sophie follows Charlie and meets Claire (Vanessa Redgrave), quite a bit older now but no less in the throes of romance. Kindly and gracious, she immediately takes a liking to Sophie and, despite Charlie's objections, lets her tag along on a cross-country search for her old flame, whose name is Lorenzo Barotlini. Sophie knows that Victor won't mind her going; he's too involved in food hunts and wine auctions to take notice.If you know anything about movie romances, then chances are you have a pretty good idea of where this is going, so I don't need to describe any more of the plot. Suffice it to say, this is a wholly delightful story with appealing characters, and it's all set against the backdrop of picturesque Italian landscapes. It was an experience that, however hokey, I was glad to be a part of. I have to treasure feelings like that because, quite frankly, I don't often have them; I'm usually pointing out all the ways in which the audience is coerced, if not shamelessly manipulated, into emotional submission. But even I have a sentimental side, and I'm glad there are movie like this that allow me to indulge in it.I was moved, for instance, by the rekindled love between Claire and Lorenzo (Franco Nero), which mirrors the real life relationship between the actors who played them. Back in 1967, Redgrave and Nero met on the set of ""Camelot"" and became romantically involved. They finally married in 2006. Considering the film's theme of officially claiming a love that had always been, can you honestly say this doesn't warm your heart just a little? Watching them together onscreen, you truly do believe that they're in love, which is more than I can say for most modern romance stories between young people who in all likelihood wouldn't know love if it came up and bit them.""Letters to Juliet"" is by no means groundbreaking cinema, but boy, is it charming. I liked the story, rote though it may be. I cared about the characters, young and old. I appreciated the fact that, in spite of his standoffish take on Victor, Bernal didn't play him as a crude, unlovable caricature. Most of all, I enjoyed the chemistry between Seyfried, Egan, Redgrave, and Nero. I can imagine a movie like this being used in the field of neuroscience, specifically in how it affects dopamine and endorphin levels, both thought to play a part in how much pleasure a person feels. I suspect most participants would show an increase. No matter how silly they may seem, some movies just make you feel good inside.",4,The Year's First Feel-Good Romance,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,5073,"['amazing', 'how', 'movies', 'work', 'people',

1306557,A1LLFJHOE7DZV,B002ZG988M,"ClarityOfMind ""Harry Wentz""","[0, 0]","Amanda Seyfried, Gael Garcia Bernal and Vanessa Redgrave present a special love story which is all because of letters left in a wall which is a tradition in a tiny town in Italy.  Amanda's character finds a letter dating back decades and she decides she will facilitate any possibility of love or at least closure for the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) who placed the letter in the wall.  Vanessa Redgrave is MUCH older by the time this occurs and much life has passed since the letter was placed in the wall.  Vanessa has a grandson who is extremely protective and a bit intense in his distrust of Amanda's motives, but these are only the main ingredients in a delightfully developing scenario where we witness many sweet scenes, a long line of disappointing events, but a love finale... or, so we think... love seems to overwhelm our characters so that we are given all the gratification this simple movie provides... a pleasure to watch and a feel-good for those with romance in their hearts.I give it 4.5 stars and think it's something you might enjoy with a loved one, be it your beloved or just your mom or aunt who appreciates a story with romance as the main ingredient in this tender tale.

Letters to Juliet is one such film.It's predictable at times yes, but it is fun and warm and beautiful to watch. Some very detailed cinematography capturing glorious landscapes can be found here. The actors and the story add a great deal to the film's warmth as well.Amanda Seyfried, who I fall a little more in love with in everything I see her do, stars as Sophie. Sophie is an American who travels to Verona Italy with her boyfriend Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), who barely recognizes she is there. Victor adores her in his own way, but is far too engulfed with pursuing his dreams becoming a terrific chef. They traveled to Verona for a romantic getaway, but as fate would have it, Victor heads off to attend cooking classes, leaving Sophie alone.Being an aspiring writer, Sophie would surely not let this trip go to waste. Her boredom takes her on a tour of the majestic countryside where she stumbles upon a discovery that will change her life forever.She finds what has been said to be the very house that once inhabited William Shakespeare's beloved character Juliet. Sophie finds thousands of love letters that have been placed snuggly into deep crevasses in the home's outer wall. They are written by women seeking wholesome love advice from Juliet. Sophie is enthralled with this ritual and one letter in particular, captures her heart.It was written some 50 years ago by a woman who had long since lost touch with a man she once loved so dearly. The woman is Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) and Sophie is so moved by her words, that she writes Claire a heartfelt letter of her own in return, inspiring Claire to track her lost love down.Claire is in turn so grateful of Sophie's kind words that she comes to Verona with her grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) in tow. Naturally Charlie is around the same age as Sophie and is dashingly handsome. As clich&eacute; as this is, I promise you that their humorous meeting and superb acting will have you more than forgiving of it.In defense of his grandmother who has been heartbroken once or twice, Charlie is not pleased by Sophie's gesture; especially when he suspects she is only interested in seeing these two lovebirds reunite, in hopes of writing a successful story about it.The dynamic of the relationships between these three characters works like clockwork in every scene. Against Charlie's wishes, Sophie and Claire hit it off right away, and the three are off on a journey to find Claire's Romeo. None of them counted on there being several hundred Italian men named Lorenzo Bartolini to sort through, but hey - that's half the fun.Director Gary Winick who also brought us 13 Going on 30, has crafted another gorgeous film. He blends solid dramatic moments with dead-on comedic timing and the film is more than entertaining. It's the kind of movie that makes you either want to call up an old flame that got away if you are single, or take a trip to Italy with your significant other; either way, it inspires good times to be had.",4,Letters to Juliet Review,1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,3383,"['LETTERS', 'TO', 'JULIETSTARRING', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Christopher', 'Egan', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'Oliver', 'PlattWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Jose', 'Rivera', 'Tim', 'SullivanDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Gary', 'WinickRated', 'PGGenre', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', '/', 'DramaRelease', 'Date', '14', 'May', '2010Review', 'Date', '20', 'May', '2010We', 'were', 'real', 'lull', 'while', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'good', 'ones', 'Letters', 'Juliet', 'one', 'such', 'film.It', 'predictable', 'times', 'yes', 'fun', 'warm', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'very', 'detailed', 'cinematography', 'capturing', 'glorious', 'landscapes', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'actors', 'story', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'warmth', 'well.Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'who', 'fall', 'little', 'more', 'love', 'everything', 'see', 'do', 'Sophie', 'Sophie', 'American', 'who', 'Verona', 'Italy', 'boyfriend', 'Victor', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'who', 'barely', 'there', 'Victor', 'own', 'way', 'far', 'too', 'engulfed', 'pursuing', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'terrific', 'chef', 'traveled', 'Verona', 'romantic', 'getaway', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'Victor', 'attend', 'cooking', 'classes', 'leaving', 'Sophie', 'alone.Being', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'Sophie', 'would', 'surely', 'not', 'let', 'trip', 'go', 'waste', 'boredom', 'tour', 'majestic', 'countryside', 'where', 'discovery', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'forever.She', 'what', 'been', 'said', 'be', 'very', 'house', 'once', 'inhabited', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'beloved', 'character', 'Juliet', 'Sophie', 'thousands', 'love', 'letters', 'have', 'been', 'placed', 'snuggly', 'deep', 'crevasses', 'home', 'outer', 'wall', 'are', 'written', 'women', 'seeking', 'wholesome', 'love', 'advice', 'Juliet', 'Sophie', 'enthralled', 'ritual', 'one', 'letter', 'particular', 'heart.It', 'was', 'written', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'long', 'lost', 'touch', 'man', 'once', 'loved', 'so', 'dearly', 'woman', 'Claire', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Sophie', 'so', 'moved', 'words', 'Claire', 'heartfelt', 'letter', 'own', 'return', 'inspiring', 'Claire', 'track', 'lost', 'love', 'down.Claire', 'turn', 'so', 'grateful', 'Sophie', 'kind', 'words', 'Verona', 'grandson', 'Charlie', 'Christopher', 'Egan', 'tow', 'Naturally', 'Charlie', 'same', 'age', 'Sophie', 'dashingly', 'handsome', 'clich', 'eacute', 'promise', 'humorous', 'meeting', 'superb', 'acting', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'forgiving', 'it.In', 'defense', 'grandmother', 'who', 'been', 'heartbroken', 'once', 'twice', 'Charlie', 'not', 'pleased', 'Sophie', 'gesture', 'especially', 'when', 'only', 'interested', 'seeing', 'two', 'lovebirds', 'reunite', 'hopes', 'writing', 'successful', 'story', 'it.The', 'dynamic', 'relationships', 'three', 'characters', 'clockwork', 'scene', 'Against', 'Charlie', 'wishes', 'Sophie', 'Claire', 'hit', 'off', 'right', 'away', 'three', 'are', 'off', 'journey', 'find', 'Claire', 'Romeo', 'None', 'counted', 'being', 'several', 'hundred', 'Italian', 'men', 'named', 'Lorenzo', 'Bartolini', 'sort', 'hey', 'fun.Director', 'Gary', 'Winick', 'who', 'also', 'brought', '13', 'Going', '30', 'crafted', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'solid', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'dead-on', 'comedic', 'timing', 'film', 'more', 'entertaining', 'kind', 'movie', 'want', 'call', 'up', 'old', 'flame', 'got', 'away', 'are', 'single', 'take', 'trip', 'Italy', 'significant', 'other', 'way', 'good', 'times', 'be', 'had']",N/A

Here's the rundown: Girl [Sophie] travels to Italy with her fiancee (who looks eerily like Balki Bartagamousse from the '80's sitcom Perfect Strangers)completely ignores her beause he is obsessed with finding the best wine/cheese/truffles for use in his soon-to-be-opened NYC restaurant.  Girl finds a letter to Juliet written 50 years ago, and commits to helping it's author [Claire, played by Vanessa Redgrave] find her long-lost love (which she does).  Girl fights with Claire's J. Crew modelesque grandson/chaueffer, which means (of course) that the two will fall in love by the film's end (which they do).  There - I just saved you ten bucks.For a ""romantic comedy"", it sure was lacking both ""comedy"" and ""romance"".  Oddly enough, the older couple [Claire and her reunited love, Lorenzo] had more sizzle than the younger people in the film, who had so little chemistry that you can't even tell that they're falling ""in love"" (aside from a random kiss in the middle of the flick) until they verbally declare it out of nowhere in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  It's all very predictable and harmless, and I've seen worse films, but this one's nothing to write home about.  It's hard to know who to blame here:  The writers?  Director? Actors?  Maybe a little of each?  In any case, the result is about as exciting as a stale corn tortilla.I give it two stars because the sceneary [Italian countryside] is absolutely stunning, and having visited Italy, it brought back memories of how beautiful a place it is.

1306572,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B002ZG988M,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[3, 9]","Gary Winick's 2010 film ""Letters to Juliet"" contains all the right ingredients to make a fabulously lighthearted romantic comedy that should teach every lover's torch to burn bright.  However, the overall combination of beautiful young stars, older, dignified stage and film veterans, captivating scenery and Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers does nothing synergistically other than create a rather bland just-under two hour fare.The problem has nothing to do with the storyline; the overall premise here sugars the heart like the perfect icing on a moist cupcake.  Sophie, (the wide-eyed and silken haired Amanda Seyfried--Dear John,Mamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)andBig Love: The Complete Seasons 1-3) a wannabe writer, travels to Verona with her fianc&eacute; Vincent (the frenetic Gael Garcia Bernel), a food and wine enthusiast and soon-to-be restaurant owner and chef.  Purveyor opportunities send the passionate Vincent on gourmand fare finding missions that take him away from his beloved and catapult her into Capulet territory--literally showing her another brick in the wall of the Casa di Guilietta.  In this case, the wall wails a bit with letters of the lovelorn from a variety of countries collected each day by a quartet of Italian Dear Abbys that act as Juliet's secretaries, dutifully answering the pleas scribbled from present day petitioners of Shakespeare's most famous maiden.  When Sophie finds an undiscovered note written by Englishwoman Claire bemoaning her decision to leave her lover Lorenzo some fifty years prior, she feels compelled to respond, setting an entire chain of events in motion that may motivate her to write an entertaining feature story but threatens her upcoming nuptials.  Enter stage left, the softly aging Claire (the one and only Vanessa Regrave) appears, prompted by Juliet's long awaited response; she comes to seek her man.  Cynical Charlie (Christopher Egan), the handsome blonde grandson scowls attractively and, of course, cannot help but hate to love the ever-romantic Sophie.  Let me reiterate: As the plot has potential, the golden cypress-speared scenes of the Crete Senesi area of Tuscany lull with their stark photographic beauty and the actors exude sex appeal and enough sad-eyed empathy to play without dialogue, why does this film seem like a wasted 105 minutes?Perhaps `wasted' is too harsh a term. The film attempts to be a pretty confection.  Nonetheless with all these marvelous ingredients, why doesn't ""Letters to Juliet"" play like a modern day Shakespearean sonnet that honors love both old and young?I think the fault lies mainly in this film's editing.  Perhaps to keep the film under two hours, Bill Pankow went digital scissor happy.  Somehow the character of Charlie transferred from the Sophie hating camp to the Sophie loving camp in crucial moments not seen on the screen.  These pre-loving/lusting moments are shown in montage fashion akin to a music video wonder depicting more Tuscan beauty and unheard dialogue between the two leads that the audience needs to hear rather than imagine.  Seyfried pouts and tears up prettily, but as in her performance in Dear John, she doesn't seem to have the range to portray a more mature character.  Egan charms with a Prince Edward polish, yet the dialogue extended to him could have been more developed, less clipped and much more believable if written to enhance his obvious selling points. As a couple, the duo does have chemistry, but the script is hard put to utilize its foundations to the fullest extent.  Not enough scenes providing more emotional disclosure limits both actors.Case in point:  both characters suffer from the loss of mothers--why not a flashback so the audience can absorb the emotional impact of this?  We understand that Sophie and her boyfriend care but do not share a passion for each other's work.  An over abundance of this interplay between Seyfried and Bernal certainly exist.  However, the same scene building is not afforded to the bond between the two eventual lovers.  Unfortunately, Redgrave's role resigns her to little significant dialogue.  As the lovesick grandma, she speaks with her eyes while she searches convincingly for the eyes of her Lorenzo.In such a film, the positive aspects of life are sure to take a warm ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" glow that at times seems more like a travelogue than an adjunct to a scene.  In ""Under the Tuscan Sun (Full Screen Edition)"" Diane Lane and her fellow players exuberantly compliment the loveliness of the scenery and even though there are many moments in Audrey Wells 2003 film that are downright corny and predictable, it somehow works for that particular genre of a film that doubles as two hours worth of tourist marketing.  Who wouldn't want to go Italy and hook up with the likes of Franco Nero, his son and grandson or Raoul Bova? A veritable smorgasbord of men for women of any age.Bottom line?  ""Letters to Juliet"" is meant to display the landscape of Tuscany and the city of Verona in Venito though the golden filter of love both young and old.  Unfortunately, due to a script that eliminates critical bonding between the two lead characters, the film lacks the warmth that one has come to expect from romantic comedy. Predictability doesn't even come into play here.  Everything looks wonderful--both the cast and locales--but a lack of engagement between the audience and the film's characters makes this reviewer wish she had more to smile and laugh about while remembering this film.  Vanessa Redgrave's quiet performance is recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Molto Potenziale . . .

While in the city made famous for being the setting of ""Romeo and Juliet"", Sophie discovers a group of women who have made it their jobs to answer letters written by love-sick woman looking for romantic help from Juliet. Sophie discovers a letter written 50 years ago and decides to answer it. This kicks off a series of events where Claire, the 65 year old letter writer (played by Vanessa Redgrave), follows Sophie's advice and returns to Verona to look for her first love.The movie follows the adventures of Sophie and Clarie's grandson Charlie (played by Christopher Egan) as they help Claire to find her long lost love and discover love and adventure of their own.All the actors are just a backdrop for the real star of this movie - the city of Verona and the surrounding countryside.

1306590,A2IQGJFF7BBMJV,B002ZG988M,Geaux Lightly,"[9, 14]","Oh how a genre has fallen. I'm 27, so I grew up with Pretty Woman, Sleepless in Seattle, While You Were Sleeping, You've Got Mail, etc. I also love the classic Hollywood ones like My Man Godfrey, Bachelor Mother, The Shop Around the Corner / In The Good Old Summertime, The Apartment, etc. As an 80s baby/90s teen, I love Ten Things I Hate About You, Clueless, and She's All That.  What Hollywood churns out now and refers to as RomComs leave a lot to be desired. `The Holiday' might have been my last enjoyable romcom.I rented `Letters to Juliet', and I am not impressed. I turned it off a few minutes ago (didn't finish it) and figured I'd write a review while it's fresh. First off, the previews didn't really appeal to me, so I knew I'd wait til On Demand or Netflix had it. Anyway, I pop it in and w/o fully knowing what it's about, I can see where it's going. It's the total clich&eacute; of the young New Yorker (who's also a writer), a fianc&eacute; who is clearly not right for her, international trip, interest in someone else's life, verbal sparring with a handsome guy....LOVE.  Now to be fair, these are common elements of a romcom, but it's about the delivery. For me, LTJ did not deliver.One reason is that I didn't find Sophie to be relatable.  I didn't find myself rooting for her and I didn't find her motivations very believable. I don't buy AS as a romantic comedy lead. It was clear it wasn't going to work out w/the fianc&eacute; and I don't think his character was needed. There was no chemistry with Charlie either and this plays into my gripe with the new romcoms. The leads don't have chemistry! It's as if they just pick an attractive guy and girl, and don't try to sell the movie.  One of the big things in romcoms is the two leads start off not liking each other, verbally sparring, something happens to ""open"" their eyes to each other, and then they fall in love.  Nowadays, not only do they not have chemistry, but the sparring isn't funny or witty, the characters come off as crabby and unpleasant (especially the guys), and it's just hard to believe that they'd fall for each other. Shop Around the Corner, In The Good Old Summertime, and You've Got Mail are all the same movie, but all three sets of leads sold the stories. Jimmy/Margaret, Judy/Van, Tom/Meg all played their roles naturally and made you want them to end up together.  You could also see the moment where they discovered that thing about the other person that made them fall in love. This movie lacked that. One minute they were fighting, and the next, they were into each other. Where was the transition? Where was that moment when their eyes connected, and we just knew? Heck, `Beauty and the Beast' got it right and wrote a song about it (`Something There That Wasn't There Before'). I just don't feel they sold it, but being a romcom, they had to get together.There was also no humor.  I kept wondering when I was going to laugh. Wasn't looking for slapstick, just something to make me crack a smile. I ended up giving up on the film. Turned it off and opted for the Wiki plot summary. I really like Vanessa Redgrave, but I couldn't make it through the film. Romantic comedies are good because they are light and fun, and if the delivery is right, the predictability doesn't bother me. Sometimes I like seeing happy endings and I even like when the endings may not be so happy but are believable (My Best Friend's Wedding), but there's something wrong when I could care less what happens to the characters.

Written by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan and directed in a very calm manner by Gary Winick, this little tour of Verona, Italy provides a lovely setting for a sweet story.Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is a 'fact finder' for a New Yorker Magazine and presents story details to her boss, editor Bobby (Oliver Platt).  She longs to be a writer but is merely on her way up the ladder. She is living with Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal) who loves her but is more caught up in his primary love of being a chef and opening a restaurant than in filling Sophie's needs.  The two plan a pre-marriage honeymoon to Italy to spend time together, but on arrival in Verona, Victor becomes enchanted with the wines, the cheeses, etc and drags Sophie around on his culinary investigations.  Sophie discovers the Juliet setting from the Shakespeare pay, a home said to be where Juliet lived and where women from all over the world leave letters on the wall asking Juliet's advice on love matters. The letters are collected everyday and answered by a charming group of women - the Juliet Secretaries - and when Amanda discovers a hidden 50 year old letter from a women named Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) who didn't follow her heart years ago and wrote for advice, Sophie writes Claire a response. The result - Claire and her supercilious grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) arrive in Verona to see if they can find Lorenzo Bartolini, the love of Claire's life she ran away from fifty years ago. Sophie, Claire and the very reluctant and pessimistic Charlie set out to find Lorenzo, finding many men with that name but none is the Lorenzo of Claire's past.  Meanwhile Victor has all but deserted Sophie in his excitement of discovering new culinary secrets and Sophie gradually falls for Charlie.  When Claire finally finds Lorenzo (Franco Nero, husband of Vanessa Redgrave in real life) destinies change and love conquers all barriers.The mentioned cast is excellent as are the actors who fill the roles of the secretaries and the people encountered in the Lorenzo search.  The cinematography by Marco Pontecorvo is lushly beautiful: the musical score by Andrea Guerra is basically a series of semi-popular type songs - not very additive or interesting.  But the overall effect is a tasty as an Italian repast on a terrace in Italy.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Homies, a helpful hint: If you ever holiday someplace romantic with your chica, do not, for the love of all that is good, ever, ever leave her to her own devices while you go do your own thing. Case in point, the guy in this movie, Victor - a passionate chef and engaged to beautiful Sophie Hall - all Victor seems to care about whilst in picturesque Verona is attending all these cooking seminars. In his skeevy passive aggressive way - he offers to ""not attend but it'll be missing an opportunity"" - he ends up leaving Sophie to her own devices. Chef should've listened to my helpful hint.LETTERS TO JULIET is a travelogue of the lush Italian countryside as much as it is a romantic comedy about characters who follow their hearts and have grand adventures while racking up petrol money. This is heart-on-its-sleeve cinema, the sort which steeps itself in unlikely dialogue such as: ""I'm sorry, I didn't know true love had an expiration date."" and ""Grazie, destino."" And the production company must've scampered off with all the rude Italians and locked them away because the locals here are across the board welcoming and charming, and it makes me wanna go visit. Sophie Hall travels to Verona with her oblivious fiance on what is intended to be a pre-honeymoon jaunt. Instead of paying attention to her, the fiance waxes rhapsodic about cheeses and mushrooms. When she offers to do her thing while he does his thing, he calls this a ""Win, win"" situation. You can't see me but I am shaking my head right now. I am wise in the matters of the heart.Sophie is a fact checker for the New Yorker magazine, but she aspires to be a writer. Serendipity arrives when Sophie, in one of her solitary walks in Verona, chances upon Juliet's Courtyard (yes, that Juliet!), on which walls brokenhearted women have posted their lovelorn, sometimes tear-stained letters. We then set eyes on the Secretaries of Juliet, women volunteers who collect these letters every day and then respond to them (and this makes me want to pick up the book this film is based on). When Sophie finds a 50-year-old letter hidden away in the wall, she embarks on an unforgettable journey, with the letter's author Claire and Claire's priggish grandson Charlie as her companions. Or, actually, she tags along while Claire goes off on her quest for lost love while Claire's grandson casts disapproving glances her way. Too much time on their hands? Maybe. Too starry-eyed? Without a doubt. But Italy will do that to you, rob you blind of your senses.Something about LETTERS TO JULIET allows you to be swept away. The glorious scenic locales inhabit this movie, and they invite you to buy into the mood and the tone. I honestly didn't think Amanda Seyfried and Chris Egan exhibited that much chemistry, although Seyfried is wonderful and pitch perfect in her role, but Egan left me unengaged, sorry to say. The two leads' characters have a prickly first meeting, so that's promising. But then the story doesn't go to demonstrate enough of Charlie's development from cynical cold fish to British gent in love. But never mind. The casting coup is in landing Vanessa Redgrave, and she is simply exquisite as the wistful Claire. She makes you long for the things that happen in this movie to happen in real life. For those incurable romantics who tend to swoon over Audrey Hepburn and Clark Gable, LETTERS TO JULIET delivers a similar whiff. See it for that and for the idyllic landscapes and for Amanda Seyfried and, mostly, for Vanessa Redgrave. And, remember, romantic holiday - stick to your girl like glue.

Although I really enjoy Amanda Seyfried, when I saw the previews for this movie, it looked a bit too much like a schmaltzy romance, a kind of celluloid goo that doesn't resonate five minutes after leaving the theater. However, wiser heads (and my partner) prevailed, and I found myself almost enchanted over the next two hours at this delightful, quiet, powerful type of romance film that truly has appeal.Ms. Seyfried finds herself once again playing another Sophie (first one in Mamma Mia!), who once again is engaged (this time to a distractable fiance played by the lovable Gael Garcia Bernal). This Sophie doesn't sing, but writes. No, she doesn't write either, but merely is a fact checker for the New Yorker magazine, but yearns to write. Due to scheduling conflicts, she and her fiance Victor fly to Verona, seemingly to have an early honeymoon, but in reality, Victor wants to dialogue business the entire trip. This leaves Sophie to find the venerable ""Juliet wall"", where hoards of heartbroken women leave love notes to Juliet attached to a wall, hoping she will help them with their crisis (remind me never to fall in love in Verona!).Seeing a woman pluck the notes from the wall, Sophie discovers a small group of women who answer these lovelorn letters (at least the ones with addresses). Sophie quickly joins the group and finds a letter one day, fifty years in the making. It was written by a young English woman who, due to circumstance, could not marry the Italian boy she loved. Sophie writes back, and invites the amazing Vanessa Redgrave into the movie, playing lovelorn Claire, and her mildly cartoony and thickly irritating grandson Charlie with her.Predictable? Entirely. You know exactly where the movie is headed ten minutes into it, and the director of the movie Gary Winick, seems to not realize it by giving us a few unnecessary scenes towards the end that could have easily been cut or shortened. However, what makes this movie five stars is the character of Claire. Her story is handled so gently, with kid gloves, a small dash of humor, and most importantly, with respect. Redgrave glows on the screen in every scene she's in, and you get the sense that the trip is more for her grandson that it ever is for her.It's not often that movies nowadays treats romance of our senior set with any respect or admiration. Sometimes, they are accorded two scenes, while the focus of the movie lands on the young twenty-nothings to carry the plot (and plop popcorn buying teens into the seats). So Claire's story is a wonderfully invigorating breath of fresh air into what could have been a stale movie. Her search is a search for love eternal, and one that the audience goes along with her, with bated breath, waiting to see if she finds her lost love, and cheering her every step of the way.",5,Romance at any age...,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,2873,"['Quite', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'plan', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'when', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'looked', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'schmaltzy', 'romance', 'kind', 'celluloid', 'goo', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'five', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'theater', 'However', 'wiser', 'heads', 'partner', 'prevailed', 'found', 'almost', 'enchanted', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'delightful', 'quiet', 'powerful', 'type', 'romance', 'film', 'truly', 'appeal.Ms', 'Seyfried', 'once', 'again', 'playing', 'Sophie', 'first', 'one', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'engaged', 'time', 'distractable', 'fiance', 'played', 'lovable', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Sophie', ""n't"", 'sing', 'No', ""n't"", 'write', 'either', 'merely', 'fact', 'checker', 'New', 'Yorker', 'magazine', 'write', 'Due', 'scheduling', 'conflicts', 'fiance', 'Victor', 'fly', 'Verona', 'seemingly', 'have', 'early', 'honeymoon', 'reality', 'Victor', 'dialogue', 'business', 'entire', 'trip', 'Sophie', 'find', 'venerable', 'Juliet', 'wall', 'where', 'hoards', 'heartbroken', 'women', 'leave', 'love', 'notes', 'Juliet', 'attached', 'wall', 'hoping', 'will', 'help', 'crisis', 'remind', 'never', 'fall', 'love', 'Verona', '.Seeing', 'woman', 'notes', 'wall', 'Sophie', 'small', 'group', 'women', 'who', 'answer', 'lovelorn', 'letters', 'least', 'ones', 'addresses', 'Sophie', 'quickly', 'group', 'letter', 'one', 'day', 'fifty', 'years', 'making', 'was', 'written', 'young', 'English', 'woman', 'who', 'due', 'circumstance', 'could', 'not', 'marry', 'Italian', 'boy', 'loved', 'Sophie', 'back', 'amazing', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'movie', 'playing', 'lovelorn', 'Claire', 'mildly', 'cartoony', 'thickly', 'irritating', 'grandson', 'Charlie', 'her.Predictable', 'Entirely', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'movie', 'headed', 'ten', 'minutes', 'director', 'movie', 'Gary', 'Winick', 'not', 'realize', 'giving', 'few', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'end', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'cut', 'shortened', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'character', 'Claire', 'story', 'handled', 'so', 'gently', 'kid', 'gloves', 'small', 'dash', 'humor', 'most', 'importantly', 'respect', 'Redgrave', 'screen', 'scene', 'get', 'sense', 'trip', 'more', 'grandson', 'ever', 'her.It', 'not', 'often', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'romance', 'senior', 'set', 'respect', 'admiration', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'accorded', 'two', 'scenes', 'focus', 'movie', 'young', 'twenty-nothings', 'carry', 'plot', 'plop', 'popcorn', 'buying', 'teens', 'seats', 'So', 'Claire', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'invigorating', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stale', 'movie', 'search', 'search', 'love', 'eternal', 'one', 'audience', 'along', 'bated', 'breath', 'waiting', 'see', 'lost', 'love', 'cheering', 'step', 'way']",N/A

Well, I loved it so much that I purchased 2 copies: one from Amazon.com and the second one from Walmart because Amazon wasn't deliverying it to my address fast enough. ""Letters To Juliet"" is a compelling love story. A love story that is told through the eyes of the old and young.Christopher Egan is an excellent choice for Amanda Seyfreid's love interest. The two of them appear matched in Heaven with their perfect good looks and classic charm. And it doesn't hurt that they look appealing on screen. Egan is really growing as an actor, already having starring roles in movies like the dark,suspenseful ""Crush"" and he shines even better in this one. Seyfreid is the perfect match for him in casting. She already has skills under belt, coming from her other love story hit, ""Dear John"" with Channing Tannum. She's the one to watch for years to come.And let's not forget the real star of this movie. The queen herself, Miss. Vanessa Redgrave. Personally, she has experienced major hardships: the death of her talented daughter, Natasha Richardson, the daughter of director, Tony Richardson, and then her only sister, the unforgettable Lynn Redgrave, but her talent still reigns in this one as her character sets out to find her true love in this remarkably funny, but touching romantic masterpiece.

Kaye Oldner ""Judith""","[1, 1]","Sophie, a fact-checker for The New Yorker, (played by Amanda Seyfried)  is engaged to marry Victor (played by Gael Garcia Bernal) who is opening up a restaurant in a few weeks. Because Victor will be too busy after the wedding with his new business, the couple decides to take a pre-honeymoon to Italy. Little does Sophie realize how much business Victor plans for this trip until after they arrive. Not too discouraged at the beginning, Sophie plans to use her time away from Victor to write. My guess was that she wanted her work published in The New Yorker.While Victor is off meeting with suppliers, visiting wineries, cheese shops and other places to help his upcoming business, Sophie decides to go off on her own sightseeing where she happened upon an alley. There she discovered Juliet's balcony, made famous by William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. These letters were collected daily and a group of women known as the Secretaries of Juliet would reply back--very much like the US version of Dear Abby only the theme here was issues of the heart.Sophie, looking for a story, decides to help and stumbles across a hole in the wall where a letter had been left more than fifty years ago. She decides to respond back and believes that the rest will remain a mystery. Imagine her surprise when the lady's grandson, Charlie, (played by Christopher Egan) shows up. He isn't there to thank her either. He's angry because his grandmother (played by Vanessa Redgrave) has it in her mind to find her lost love, Lorenzo Bartollini. Soon the three embark on a sometimes comical, sometimes sad journey about true love.I loved everything about the movie, but my favorite character was Victor, who wasn't Italian but pretended to be. Though he was made to be the bad guy here, I found his role hilarious. He had such a passion for food, wine, and cooking that was admirable.

While he looks after dealers to help his restaurant business she gets involved with answering letters to Juliet and finds a 50 year old letter.  She writes back and inspires Claire to come to Italy and seek her ""true love"" despite the decades that have passed and the protests of her grandson, Charlie and wait for it . . . Charlie and Sophie end up falling in love as they search for her Grandmother's long lost lover.  First, the good: Amanda Seyfried as Sophie.  She does a great job and is incredibly likable and there is some depth to her character.  Also great is Vanessa Redgrave as Claire.  She is believable and very likable and manages to be attractive and graceful in her pursuit of love as a grandmother.  The four secretaries to Juliet are very likable and fun and you wish they had more scenes in the movie.  The ending scene is actually touching even though you know the outcome.  The OK: yes, you can guess the ending and there are predictable turns as the story moves along but overall it is enjoyable story.  The  bad: there is really nothing Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal can do with the character Victor.  Sophie's fiance is a plastic figurine absolutely obsessed/possessed with his restaurant and food in general.  If he even smells food he completely ignores the beautiful Amanda Seyfried/Sophie and is so unlikable you want to hit him as he sniffs like a starving rat after every morsel of food or wine.  If you go to Italy with someone as stunning as Amanda Seyfried and had any inkling of feelings towards her you would not leave her for a minute much less completely ignore her.  Also not so great is Christopher Egan's character of Charlie.  I am sure there are a lot of deleted scenes which they were forced to cut which actually developed his character a little more.  As it is, he moves from annoying nay sayer to charming Romeo a little too quickly.Overall, a fun, if not predictable romantic comedy, that is definitely worth watching (which romantic comedies aren't predictable in some sense).

The locals who answer the letters on Juliet's behalf invite Sophie to join them and her response to a 50-year old letter will change several lives forever.This has all the makings of a charming chick flick, telling an idealistic love story in a stunningly beautiful place.

She does not wear a ring. That's the first hint that things are amiss in paradise. Sophie and her intended go off to Italy on a pre-wedding Honeymoon, during which he becomes engrossed in Italian cuisine and she becomes engrossed in the city of Verona and its romantic attachment to Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET. They spend no time together. She discovers that there is a kind of Wailing Wall in Verona, where heartbroken women leave messages addressed to Juliet.By chance, she finds a 50 year old letter from Claire (Vanessa Redgrave, who, thank God, eschews politics in this film) telling the story of her lost love, Lorenzo. Sophie answers, and before long, Claire appears with her grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) in tow. The three set off, seeking Lorenzo.The results are predictable all around. The difficulty with LETTERS TO JULIET is that Charlie is initially so rude and so dismissive of Sophie that their eventual attraction to each other seems an impossible outcome. Worse yet, Egan and Seyfried have ZERO chemistry onscreen (Seyfried is lovely and wide-eyed while Egan, squinty-eyed and grimacing, appears to be suffering from a digestive complaint all throughout the film). The mother-daughter affection that blooms between Claire and Sophie seems so much more sincere than the forced and faked ""love"" that Sophie and Charlie proclaim for one another.Seyfried tries her best to entertain her audience, but there are better romantic comedies out there.",2,"""What if . . . ?""

About unrequited or interrupted love.  And about a romantic tradition in which lovers all over come to one site to leave letters for Juliet (of Romeo and Juliet).Amanda Seyfried's character Sophie has come to Italy with her fiance, but they end up going their separate ways to separate events.  On her own, she becomes fascinated with watching women place their letters at a monument, and then seeing that one woman collects them all at the end of the day.  She follows that woman and learns of how she writes back to everyone (as Juliet).  Shortly afterwards, while helping to collect the letters, Sophie discovers a letter behind a brick that was left there 50 years ago.  She writes to that woman, and a short time later, the woman and her grandson appear.  And thus begins the real romantic quest as Sophie helps Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) search for her long lost love.Vanessa Redgrave made the movie worthwhile, as did the quest itself.  We got to see a lot of Italian landscapes on this journey, and could vicariously enjoy the moments along the way.At one point, I wished that Amanda Seyfried's character would burst into song...I loved her singing voice in Mama Mia.

She is engaged to Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), a chef who is gearing up to open his own restaurant in New York City, which explains not only why they are taking their ""honeymoon"" to Verona before the wedding, but why Victor is more interested in checking out the local food and wine than on spending quality time with Sophie.  Left on her own, Sophie visits Casa di Giulietta, an old house in Verona that has a balcony and is purported to be Juliet's house (of course it is not--for one thing the ""true story"" was set in Siena--but clearly visitors are employing ""Velveteen Rabbit"" logic, which I have seen played out with equal emotion at another faux site, namelyGreen Gableson Prince Edward Island).  Visitors from around the world flock there and Sophie discovers dozens of women writing letters to Juliet, which they then stick on the wall beneath the balcony.  At the end of the day a woman shows up, carefully removes the letters, and puts them in a basket.Sophie follows the woman and discovers the Club di Giulietta, a quartet of women who volunteer to respond to the letters left to Juliet.  Intrigued by the whole idea as a possible story to jump start her literary career, Sophie is inspired when she discovers a letter left in a hole in the wall fifty years ago in which a young woman bemoans the fact that she did not keep an appointment with the man she loved.  Sophie responds to the letter and the next thing we know Charlie (Christopher Egan) shows up and wants to know what idiot wrote his grandmother Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) that letter, because she has dragged him to Italy to find Lorezno Bartolini, her long lost love.Of course, as soon as you know the basic set up you know that Sophie is going to tag along with Claire and Charlie on this romantic question, and it is fairly obvious who is going to end up with whom.  Consequently, there are not any great surprises, although when Charlie first shows up he does tend to make Victor look better, even though by that point it is clear that Sophie should ditch her fianc&eacute; because being with nobody is preferable to being with him.  That being said, there is not a lot of depth to the developing relationship between Sophie and Charlie beyond the looks in Claire's eyes that make it clear this is a consummation that she devoutly wishes.  It ends up being what I think of as a Stephen Stills romance, to wit, ""love the one you're with,"" so this 2010 film from director Gary Winnick (""Bride Wars""), is enjoyable but is not going to be one that you will watch time and time again to make yourself weep at the emotional power of love.I first heard of ""Letters from Juliet"" when the trailer for this summer romantic comedy screened right after a trailer for ""Dear John.""  Apparently actress Seyfried was looking over two scripts about love stories in which letters play a pivotal role and if she flipped a coin it must have landed on its edge because she did both of them, back-to-back.  ""Dear John"" was more of a tragic romance, while ""Letters from Juliet"" would qualify more as a romantic comedy, although with the emphasis way more on the romance than on the comedy, which is rather refreshing given some of the recent films I have seen in this genre.  This is not a great romantic film, but it is certainly more enjoyable than the recent offerings I have seen (e.g., ""When in Rome,"" ""Leap Year,"" and, for that matter, ""Dear John"").The chief charm of this film, in addition to the lush Italian countryside, is Redgrave, who provides a case study in making acting look completely effortless (and then there is the wholeFranco Nerobackstory).  She also gets the big romantic moment in the movie, when she gets around to reading a pivotal letter.  Seyfried is a busy young actress these days, and when I see here I always wonder who would have thought that Lindsay Lohan would turn out to be the least talented of the actresses in ""Mean Girls.""  I still think at this pointRachel McAdamscomes in first, but Seyfried comes in a close second, especially after she showed she could do more than just carry a tune in ""Mamma Mia! The Movie.""  This time around I noticed that when her face lights up and she goes for a big smile, that smile reminds me very much of Goldie Hawn's, which is just another plus in Seyfried's favor.In case it is not clear, people really do write letters to Juliet and for seven decades women in Verona have been writing back, as volunteers of the Juliet Club.  If you are interested in the ""true story"" (or 75 ""true letters""), then check out Letters to Juliet: Celebrating Shakespeare's Greatest Heroine, the Magical City of Verona, and the Power of Love by Lise Friedman and Ceil Friedman.  The book is acknowledged in the end credits, although it is not a source for the screenplay by Jose Rivera (""The Motorcycle Diaries"") and Tim Sullivan (""Jack and Sarah""), but some sort of accommodation has to be made when you have the same title and the same subject.  So, yes, that really is the Casa di Giulietta, and visitors really do leave letters and rub the breast of the statue of Juliet because legend has it that brings you good luck.  Final note: When I saw this film the plan was to go out for Chinese food afterwards, but halfway through the opening scenes I was suddenly starving and it was obvious we were going to have to go out for fancy Italian food (five cheese crespelle with sausage).  I am glad we did not give in and munch on popcorn, because sometimes the unconventional order of doing a movie and dinner is justified.",4,"When you write a letter to Juliet, Juliet writes

1306681,A8ZY9LI1KBU2P,B002ZG988M,Mary Kate,"[2, 4]","The Set-Up: Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a fact-checker for the New Yorker and her fianc&eacute;, Victor (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal), a budding restaurateur (two jobs that, apparently, pay much more handsomely than I would have guessed), go on a ""pre-honeymoon"" to Verona, Italy. There, Victor immerses himself in meetings with wine and food vendors he hopes will become his suppliers and Sophie, left on her own, discovers a group of women who answer love letters left at the home of Shakespeare's tragic Juliet. Invited to join these women in their work, Sophie discovers a letter written some 50 years earlier and pens an answer to it, which brings the letter writer, Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) and her grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) to Verona. There, Sophie, Claire and the argumentative Charlie meet and, over Charlie's objections, decide to seek out Lorenzo Bertolini, Claire's lost love. Rather than (sensibly) making a series of phone calls, they choose to pay personal visits to each of the Lorenzo Bertolini's Sophie (using those fact-checking skills) was able to find within a certain radius of Verona. This calls for a road trip.Before its release and in many reviews, much was made of the scenery in the film; I seem to recall one reviewer going so far as to call it a character. And I'll agree that there are certainly some stunning shots, particularly of the countryside. On the other hand, I found myself disappointed that we did not see a lot more of Verona and Siena. The glimpses we got of the cities were so wonderful that I found myself longing to see a lot more of them - and a lot less of the interior of the car.Letters to Juliet is utterly predictable. I honestly felt like I could have outlined nearly every scene just from seeing the trailer, and a good chunk of the dialogue, too. I will say, though, that the predictability wasn't excruciatingly annoying and, at the film's end, I didn't leave the theater feeling like I had just wasted two precious hours of my life. Hence the ""mostly harmless"" in my review title.While I could argue that I actually found the vibrantly-portrayed Victor (the fianc&eacute; whose passion for food and cooking made it possible for us to like him even though he was cluelessly neglectful of his bride to be), the most interesting character in Letters to Juliet, the film is most definitely Redgrave's. Claire's search for her Lorenzo is poignant and the enduring passion between them is handled with sweetness and a lovely delicacy. Her search also provided what were, for me, the two best things in the film: humor as each new Lorenzo was found and checked off the list and some genuine suspense as I waited for Franco Nero to finally make an appearance so that I could see how well the actor had aged.

She writes anyway and the women (played by the indelible Vanessa Redgrave) shows up with her grandson detailing she's a widow and wants to find out what happened to her Italian love. This is a charming tale which leaps from American to Italy but spends about 85% of its time in the latter. Vanessa Redgrave is brilliant, dominating various scenes and playing the part of the grandmother that many of us wish we had had growing up. The themes on love are done well, the Italian countryside is breathtaking and there is an overall lovely fantasy feel to the movie. It's hard to hate anyone in this film and the humor had some funny takes. The ending is predictable but the audience wants it that way so nobody but the deepest of cynics should feel ripped off. This film was the last one for its director before he died of brain cancer. It cost $30M and the box office yielded roughly $80M.

But I think the most important thing is entertainment, and especially with this film, I find them vastly entertaining.  In a world full of so many romantic movies, Letters to Juliet really does stand out for me.Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is a fact checker for the New Yorker.  Her real dream is to be a writer, but for now she enjoys her work and is quite good at it.  However, now is a time for her to take a break from work.  She and her fiance Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), a chef embarking on opening a restaurant, are taking a trip to Italy as a sort of pre-honeymoon.  Sophie and Victor have very different ideas for their trip though.  She is interested in sight seeing the area and local attractions, while he is more interested with the food and meeting with vendors for his restaurant.  They sort of drift in different directions while they find things that interest them on their trip.Sophie drifts to Juliet's house in Verona.  There she discovers a wall in which people from all over the world write to Juliet to ask for advice on their relationships (perhaps its just me but I find it a bit amusing that they would write to Juliet in this matter seeing how her relationship turned out).  She becomes immersed with discovering the story behind this wall, especially when she sees a young woman take all the letters away in a basket.  To her surprise, she finds a group of women who have taken it upon themselves to answer every letter that is left for Juliet.  She tags along the next few days and finds a very old letter stuck behind a loose brick.  Its from a lady named Claire and she had written it fifty years before.  Inspired, Sophie writes back to her.She is ever surprised when in the same week, dashing angry Charlie (Christopher Egan) shows up and berates her for writing the letter.  She learns from him that his grandmother Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) received the letter and was inspired to come search for the true love she had left all those years ago.  They travel the country in search of Lorenzo (Franco Nero) despite the fact that there are many Lorenzo's listed in the area.  It begins a wonderful road trip for them and even though Sophie and Charlie argue and disagree on the trip, they both learn the value of searching for true love.I thought most of the characters in this movie were well cast.  Although he doesn't have a large part, Nero played Lorenzo with true passion and affection and it was very sweet to watch him interact with Claire.  Redgrave as Claire was also wonderful.  She had such a longing in her acting and I really did think she was searching for a lost love in true life.  Sophie was interesting, she could be a bit cold at times, but she had true emotions and wanted the best for the situation, despite the fact that she was using it to write about.  I was a bit disappointed in Charlie.  He came off abrasive through much of the film and it was hard to like him or understand his complete turn around toward the end as it didn't seem genuine.  I also felt sorry for Victor as a character.  Personally I would have loved exploring his Italy with all its wonderful chances at eating delectable food, but alas, that was not what this story was about.While the plot could be called predictable, I thought it was great.  I had a few tears in my eyes at time and was truly touched by the movie.  It started off a bit slow, but was well worth sticking through and watching the entire movie.The music fit very well with the movie.  It ranged from Italian pop, to slow ballads and even some Taylor Swift.  Every piece matched perfectly the scene in which it was played.  Another beautiful thing in the movie was the scenery.  Italy is definitely gorgeous and this movie did a great job of showing off the wonder that is the area.It was definitely a charming romance and one I plan on watching again and again.  Those who don't like chick flicks probably won't enjoy it, but even if you only have a slight taste for the genre, its one of the better ones to watch.Review by M.

Other times, my patience is richly rewarded. Last night was one of those times.I was so excited to get to see ""Letters to Juliet""  last night. It tells the story of a wannabe writer, Sophia, who goes off to Verona on a vacation with her fiance. He's busy scoping out suppliers for his new restaurant, so she takes advantage of the time to do some sight-seeing on her own. In doing so, she comes across a group of women called the ""secretaries of Juliet"" who write back to the women who leave their letters asking for love advice at Juliet's wall. She joins them, and finds a letter written 50 years earlier (it had been stuck behind a brick). On a whim, she responds to the woman who had left her one true love behind when she was a girl. The letter finds the owner, the owner's grandson finds Sophia and the adventure to find Lorenzo (the man left behind) begins. I am a sucker for a good love story and this one certainly met the bill.

Especially ones shot in lovely foreign cities with beautiful landscapes and amazingly classic architecture.  Sophie (a name which has made quite the resurgence in recent years), played by the beautiful Amanda Seyfried is a fact checker for the New Yorker with the ambition of becoming a writer for the mag.  She is engaged to the passionate and easily distracted Victor (played enthusiastically by Gael Garcia Bernal), a soon to be restaurateur in New York.  The two embark on a pre-honeymoon trip to Italy to both meet suppliers for Victor's restaurant and to site-see together.  But guess what?  Victor and his passion for food has overshadowed Sophie and the sites of Italy.So what's a girl to do?  Go off alone and visit the old digs of the most tragic heroine of all love stories'- the home of Juliet Capulet.  Where love-lorn females from all over the world leave letters for Juliet and hope for an answer.  I think most of you know where the film goes after that - Sophie finds an old letter from the 50's and, under the guise of being one of ""Juliet's secretaries, ""has"" to write a response.  Her letter fuels a trip to find lost love, while giving our main characters a chance to find themselves...All romantics must see this film!  Yes it was cheesy (complete with scaling castle walls and white horses).  Yes it was predictable.  But it was also beautifully shot with likable characters.  And call me easy, but that makes it a must-see film.  I was fully engaged with the characters and their conflicts in this movie.  I appreciated the two versions of Sophie we got to see.  She was sweet and a little bit of a push-over at work and with her fianc&eacute;, but assertive and unshakable in her position with Charlie (played by Christopher Egan) , the overprotective grandson of Claire (Vanessa Redgrave looking quite striking) who wrote the letter from the 50's.  Can I just say how friggin beautiful Amanda Seyfried is?  She looks like she jumped out of a fairytale story with her blond hair and fabulous pout.Anyway, I believe that with romantic comedies you always know how it will end up, you simply must enjoy the ride, and Letters to Juliet is quite the pleasant ride of human characters and satisfying encounters.

1306728,A3IXC749UVCXWF,B002ZG988M,Sabrina M. Messenger,"[2, 3]","Earlier this year, I saw the movie ""Letters to Juliet"" on the big screen at the movie theatre and enjoyed it a lot...at the time. Then I read the book on which the movie was based...and as a result, my view of the movie has changed dramatically.Hence the reason for this review.When you compare the two, and despite the attempt by the moviemakers to have a strong tie in between the book and the movie...it becomes alarmingly apparent one is not at all related to the other...and I found that quite disappointing. I felt cheated... as though I had been offered a mediocre fast food meal with diet pop when I could've (and should've) had a five course gourmet feast, complete with fine vintage wine.If I had a chance to ask the filmmaker and screenwriter some questions, I'd ask first of all, why didn't they follow the book more closely? Next, I'd ask why did they create an unrelated storyline with fictitious two dimensional characters when there was plenty of intriguing real life stories already in the book that they could've been developed? Is Hollywood truly that risk aversive that have to stick with the template even when it's clear it's not all that appropriate for the story?To me, it's as though the people involved with this film overlooked a 24K diamond at Tiffany's in favor of cubic zirconium from Wal-Mart. I would've LOVED to have seen a romantic movie that was montage of those real life stories, or at least based on some of those stories brought to film rather than coming up with fictitious characters. Ok...maybe it would've been taking a risk into crossing into ""art house"" territory, but it would've been much more interesting...and ultimately enduring.It seems to me an opportunity was missed here.Instead of making a truly beautiful film that could've been one that was unique and special, the makers of ""Letters To Juliet"" went for the typical Hollywood box office ""sure thing"" and got all formulaic on us and made yet another status quo rom-com... almost indistinguishable from the others. Sure it made money, and people liked it but let's face it because of the compromise...Letters to Juliet will never be considered the classic it could've and should've been.Now there are some positives of the movie, however...I loved the storyline with Claire/Lorenzo, the couple separated by 50 years. So nice to see more and more storylines in movies with age appropriate romantic partners who are over age 50...and I thought was especially cool when I read how the real life actors, Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero, have a similar love story to the movie. It seems that Art does truly imitate life, eh?I wasn't at all enamored with the ""romance"" between Sophie and Charles. I felt it was superficial and yes, predictable. To me, Charles had very little going for him apart from his Prince William good looks...and his cynicism was annoying.  At least Victor the restauranteur was truly passionate about something in life, which to me, made him considerably more attractive than Charles!If I were to re-write this movie, I would have an alternative ending...my alternative? Have both men be interested in Sophie , but in the end have Sophie remain with Victor the restaurateur after seeing them work through their issues and ideas of what is romantic and have them discover what truly endures in a relationship. After all, isn't part of the purpose of an engagement period to find out those things that can be or can't be worked out in a relationship? If the screenwriters had read the book carefully, they would've realized that the real-life Juliet ""secretaries"" often gave advice to bored and unhappy couples...and that advice was usually in the vein that encourages a couple to stay together and work things out rather than run around looking for an unrealistic or unattainable ideal under the guise of ""romance.""  If that sort of thing was shown between Sophie and Victor, that would've made the movie much truer to the book...and even if they couldn't let Sophie and Victor be together, then at least they should've let Victor find a nice Italian girl who was equally as passionate about the restaurant biz and let them be together happily...""win win"" as Victor would say! I just thought it was sort of unfair he was left without anyone at all... lolAnother issue I had with this film in comparison to the book?The film implies that somehow ONLY women visit the Juliet wall, and write letters to her. I was surprised to discover that many of the real-life letters to Juliet asking for her guidance and advice were written by boys and men! Yet this movie continues to assert that men are not romantic...especially with creating the two dimensional stereotypical British ""cynic"" Charles...who only had his Prince William good looks going for him... and the 'workaholic' American Italo-phile Victor who was passionate about everything except his fianc&eacute;e!Besides, the idea that men are not romantics is a myth...as the book clearly demonstrates. Consider that Shakespeare must have been a romantic at heart if he could write Romeo and Juliet in the first place, and also one of the most romantic poets in Italian history was Dante. If he had been alive today, maybe he would've written to Juliet about his one sided crush on Beatrice? Who knows?I hate to say it, but Letters to Juliet (the movie) in the future will be one of those movies that will not stand the test of time. It will be as memorable as the bag of potato chips I ate with yesterday's lunch!",3,"Nice enough flick, but the moviemakers really missed an opportunity here by not following the book more

This is a fictional take on  one of them and the ""Juliet's secretary"" (yes, they exist in real life, too) who found and answered her letter...50 years later.Vanessa Redgrave is sublime in a story that parallels her own life.

Vanessa stars here as a widow who comes back to Verona to try to find the man  she lost the courage to run away with 50 years ago. Playing opposite her is Franco Nero, the Italian actor she fell in love when they played Guinevere and Lancelot in the movie ""Camelot,"" and then reunited with and finally married some 40 years  later in 2006.

1306751,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002ZG988M,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 4]","The romantic comedy is a staple of the multi-plex. Studios consistently trot out formulaic offerings pairing two attractive people in a story little better than your average television show. A number of recent examples have used old-fashioned romantic comedies as their 'inspiration'. ""When in Rome"" seems to be modeled after the old Doris Day and Rock Hudson films. Nothing in the film could ever happen in reality and the actors seem to keep winking at the camera. Unfortunately, they seem to be the only ones in on the joke. In ""The Bounty Hunter"", Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler spend the entire film fighting with one another, often inflicting physical pain on one another. In the end, they get together (I'm sure that was a big surprise) but you won't care because the rest of the film is so unpleasant. In ""The Back-Up Plan"", animated, very retro style opening credits clue us in to indicate the inspiration for the film would be any lighthearted romance from the 60s. Unfortunately, the film contains many lengthy sequences, which seem to be funny only to the cast and crew involved. And the filmmakers seem insistent on making Jennifer Lopez appear Caucasian. A very strange film.So it is a surprise to find ""Letters from Juliet"", a sweet, romantic, fun to watch and slightly formulaic film starring Amanda Seyfried (HBO's ""Big Love"", ""Mamma Mia""), Vanessa Redgrave, Christopher Egan (lots of TV work) and Gael Garcia Bernal.Sophie (Seyfried), a fact checker for the New Yorker magazine, dreams of becoming a writer. She and her fianc&eacute;, Victor (Bernal), a restaurateur, travel to Verona for a pre-marriage Honeymoon, Victor's restaurant opens in a few weeks, so they want to get away before the wedding. In Verona, Victor quickly starts to get engrossed in local wineries, cheese makers, and butchers, anything that might help his new restaurant. Sophie was hoping the trip would be something more romantic. One day, she wanders to Juliet's wall late in the afternoon. As she sits composing a letter, she watches a woman gather all of the letters and follows her back to a small room above a restaurant. There, she meets a group of women who are known as ""Juliette's secretaries"". They answer every letter, trying to provide some hope to the lovelorn ladies who feel it necessary to write Juliet discussing their love problems. Sophie becomes intrigued and starts to ask questions. The next day, she finds a letter hidden in the wall for fifty years. She decides to write back to Claire, a British woman seeking advice about her affair with an Italian lover. A few days later, Charlie (Egan), Claire's grandson shows up and wants to know who wrote the letter. Charlie is not a romantic and doesn't appreciate the intrusion. Sophie learns he has accompanied his grandmother, Claire (Redgrave) and wants to meet her. Before you can say ""Shakespeare"", Sophie is accompanying them as they crisscross Tuscany trying to find Claire's long lost lover.Seyfried is good as Sophie. She is cute but somehow doesn't seem overly beautiful which helps her seem a little more realistic and interesting. She also makes Sophie more intelligent than most of the characters in these films. Perhaps because she already has a fianc&eacute;e, she isn't looking for love and when she finds it, it seems more natural. As she realizes Victor is more interested in visiting cheese merchants and wine auctions, she shows her disappointment in a subtle way. She wants to express her feelings, but she can see how excited Victor is about these things, so she lets him have his fun. She gives us the feeling this is what she believes a new bride should do, make a certain number of sacrifices. And then she finds out about Juliet's Secretaries and meets Claire and her grandson and finds both a subject for a story she can write for the New Yorker and an adventure to fill her time in Italy.During the road trip, she and Charlie spend a lot of time together and get to know one another better. At times, this is both a blessing and curse for both as Charlie finds himself attracted to Sophie and Sophie occasionally learns more about Charlie, making her even less interested in him. But of course, they also begin to see each other as they truly are, as they let their defenses down and begin to talk. This seems to draw them together.Christopher Egan is good as Charlie. He is probably the most stereotypical of the three characters and he has the least wiggle room to bring anything new and exciting to the character. But he controls the character, showing his traits in subtle and believable ways. We quickly learn Charlie is not a romantic and finds the entire trip frustrating beyond belief. This makes Sophie dislike him, because she is completely the opposite and can't understand Charlie's skepticism. But as they spend time together, Sophie learns a little about Charlie, allowing us a glimpse into the young man's life, which in turn makes him more empathetic.The real selling point for this film is Vanessa Redgrave. Her presence simply makes the film more believable and interesting. From the moment she first appears on screen as Claire, you get her. She looks at Sophie with hopeful, yet tired eyes. She is, after all, looking for her long lost love from fifty years ago. As she makes this journey, we get the sense she is waking up, finding renewed meaning to her life. But because she has gone through so much of her life, she is a bit weary and a bit tired. Even though she is hopeful, she is prepared for the worse. Somehow, this makes our emotions more in tune with hers. We feel her emotions more. She also knows her grandson too well and is able to make a quick comment putting him in his place as necessary.There are a few scenes with Redgrave, which simply make the rest of the film work. In one, she talks with Sophie about her husband, Charlie's grandfather. At the beginning of the journey, Charlie seems more annoyed because his grandmother is looking for ""the love of her life"" and can't understand why that person isn't his grandfather. ""Let's not totally negate my existence"", he asks. Claire and Sophie share a conversation giving us the back-story of this moment. In another, Claire seems to be losing hope but Sophie urges her on, making her believe they will indeed find her long lost love. Redgrave makes this moment work through her reactions to Sophie.Gael Garcia Bernal plays Victor, an aspiring restaurateur. He is actually cartoonish and dense throughout. Victor is very excited about his restaurant and quickly becomes overwhelmed by the possibilities when they arrive in Verona. His connection sets up meetings with winemakers, cheese makers, butchers and more. And Victor jumps in feet first. But Sophie isn't interested and starts to sightsee on her own. Victor is a stupid man, bringing his fianc&eacute;e to a country on the pretext of a romantic trip and essentially abandoning her for visits to possible food vendors, touring their caves and fields. The fact he seems so oblivious makes him a bit of an idiot and not very believable.Some moments work really hard to stretch the credibility of everything else. When Sophie writes the answer to Claire, they mail it on the third (?) night of her stay. In the next scene, Charlie shows up with his grandmother and Sophie is still in Verona. Huh? There is no way a letter would make it from Verona to the English Countryside in less than a week. Then, Claire and Charlie have to make the travel arrangements and actually travel to Italy. Sophie is either on the longest vacation in history or we are supposed to believe the letter arrives in one day. A small quibble, because this is a romantic drama and comedy and we have to suspend a certain amount of belief and go with it. The filmmakers need Sophie and Charlie to meet, so we have to take this jump and move on.""Letters to Juliet"" provides a nice homage to the romantic films of the 50s and 60s and gets most of the moments right. Because it gets it right, we enjoy the ride and believe in the budding romance.""Letters to Juliet"" is a welcome surprise.",4,Surprisingly chamring,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,8092,"['romantic',

It doesn't hurt that the movie is mainly set in the beautiful countryside of Verona, Italy and the gorgeous cinematography is one of the major highlights of this movie. Aspiring writer Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is engaged to be married to chef and budding entrepreneur Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal). The pair travel to Italy for a vacation but each is consumed by work, leaving little time for each other. Then Sophie finds a 50-year-old note addressed to Shakespeare's Juliet, and takes it upon herself to answer it. When the woman who wrote the note discovers it, Sophie finds herself being swept up in a real life romantic quest to discover the recipient of the note.Claire, the genteel woman who wrote the note is played by the majestic Vanessa Redgrave, who always manages to light up the screen in any role she plays, even if it is not a major role. Claire is accompanied on her quest by both Sophie, who is happy to tag along as she finds inspiration for her writing, and Claire's cynical grandson,Charlie, who grudgingly accompanies his grandmother. The trio search for the elusive Lorenzo, whom Claire met as a young teen of fifteen almost fifty years earlier.The movie worked for me because of the credible interplay between the three main characters. Amanda Seyfried is lovely and charming and plays her role earnestly while sharing a credible chemistry with Charlie (Christopher Egan). The two young people contrast nicely with the aging yet graceful Claire who has much wisdom to impart even as she herself makes new discoveries about the power of love to bring about change. This wonderful interaction between the cast coupled with the magnificent backdrop of Verona, Italy makes for a lovely romantic drama. I recommend this movie for those who love romance dramas set in Italy, and also recommend my personal favoriteUnder the Tuscan Sun (Widescreen Edition)andEnchanted April.",4,Ms. Redgrave shines in this lovely romance,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,2020,"['storyline', 'Letters', 'Juliet', 'may', 'be', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'sappy', 'found', 'engaging', 'charming', 'watch', 'nevertheless', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'movie', 'mainly', 'set', 'beautiful', 'countryside', 'Verona', 'Italy', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'one', 'major', 'highlights', 'movie', 'Aspiring', 'writer', 'Sophie', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'chef', 'budding', 'entrepreneur', 'Victor', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'pair', 'travel', 'Italy', 'vacation', 'consumed', 'work', 'leaving', 'little', 'time', 'other', 'Then', 'Sophie', '50-year-old', 'note', 'addressed', 'Shakespeare', 'Juliet', 'answer', 'When', 'woman', 'who', 'wrote', 'note', 'Sophie', 'being', 'swept', 'up', 'real', 'life', 'romantic', 'quest', 'discover', 'recipient', 'note.Claire', 'genteel', 'woman', 'who', 'wrote', 'note', 'played', 'majestic', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'always', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'role', 'even', 'not', 'major', 'role', 'Claire', 'accompanied', 'quest', 'Sophie', 'who', 'happy', 'tag', 'along', 'inspiration', 'writing', 'Claire', 'cynical', 'grandson', 'Charlie', 'who', 'grudgingly', 'grandmother', 'trio', 'search', 'elusive', 'Lorenzo', 'whom', 'Claire', 'met', 'young', 'teen', 'fifteen', 'almost', 'fifty', 'years', 'earlier.The', 'movie', 'worked', 'credible', 'interplay', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'lovely', 'charming', 'role', 'earnestly', 'sharing', 'credible', 'chemistry', 'Charlie', 'Christopher', 'Egan', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'contrast', 'nicely', 'aging', 'yet', 'graceful', 'Claire', 'who', 'much', 'wisdom', 'impart', 'even', 'new', 'discoveries', 'power', 'love', 'bring', 'about', 'change', 'wonderful', 'interaction', 'cast', 'coupled', 'magnificent', 'backdrop', 'Verona', 'Italy', 'lovely', 'romantic', 'drama', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'love', 'romance', 'dramas', 'set', 'Italy', 'also', 'recommend', 'personal', 'favoriteUnder', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andEnchanted', 'April']",N/A
