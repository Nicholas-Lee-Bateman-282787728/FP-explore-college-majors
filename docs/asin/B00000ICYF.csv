503364,AGNOPNCN6FHB6,B00000ICYF,DoMeNiQuE  CoE,"[0, 0]","enjoyed this film immensely and was surprised how the script exploited the stereotype of swedes, are they really that much stronger, independent, honest, and beautiful as depicted in this film, well, at least in the farming community?  each culture does have a mainstream characteristic that seperates them from other countries and geographical regions and this is prolly no exception.  I always found the Italian stereotype misleading but just looking at what that country produced in music, art, and architecture alone definitely sets it apart from others so perhaps it's not misleading to the unsuspecting viewers with less worldly experience.  I found the whole process of being nominated for a congressional seat to be so delusional that when she was walking alll those steps to the capitol I felt nauseous thinking what did that nice girl do to deserve such a disastrous career choice, post-war idealism at it's height was no match for the cynicism and complete breakdown of current political service.  this ending ruined the entire romance and mostly light hearted and deligfhtful fare maintained througout the film.  Seeing Arness as the strapping brother of Young was startling as I found him to be much more handsome as he grew older.  Can't say that about many actors despite the aid of more knife and less fork...  Young never looked more beautiful in this film and found her accent acceptable and not distracting.  Was expecting the butler to be a real challenge given his rep but never saw a flaw in his interactions as the boss, kinda wanted to see her overcome that with her wit and confidence.  sure glad they did not do a FD2 with her fighting corruption, lobbyists, pork projects, and smiling for the constituents.  and oh btw, they kept talking about replacing the rep for the 15th district but the signs all said the 13th???  high recommend for Young, Cotton, Barrymore fans and swedes(?), would love to hear from the Nordic countries who felt this well represented their culture.",3,Blonde Marshall Dillon!!!,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,2001,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'script', 'exploited', 'stereotype', 'swedes', 'are', 'really', 'much', 'stronger', 'independent', 'honest', 'beautiful', 'depicted', 'film', 'well', 'least', 'farming', 'community', 'culture', 'have', 'mainstream', 'characteristic', 'other', 'countries', 'geographical', 'regions', 'prolly', 'exception', 'always', 'found', 'Italian', 'stereotype', 'misleading', 'just', 'looking', 'what', 'country', 'produced', 'music', 'art', 'architecture', 'alone', 'definitely', 'apart', 'others', 'so', 'perhaps', 'not', 'misleading', 'unsuspecting', 'viewers', 'less', 'worldly', 'experience', 'found', 'whole', 'process', 'being', 'nominated', 'congressional', 'seat', 'be', 'so', 'delusional', 'when', 'was', 'walking', 'alll', 'steps', 'capitol', 'felt', 'nauseous', 'thinking', 'what', 'did', 'nice', 'girl', 'do', 'deserve', 'disastrous', 'career', 'choice', 'post-war', 'idealism', 'height', 'was', 'match', 'cynicism', 'complete', 'breakdown', 'current', 'political', 'service', 'ending', 'ruined', 'entire', 'romance', 'mostly', 'light', 'hearted', 'deligfhtful', 'fare', 'maintained', 'film', 'Seeing', 'Arness', 'strapping', 'brother', 'Young', 'was', 'startling', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'handsome', 'grew', 'older', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'many', 'actors', 'aid', 'more', 'knife', 'less', 'fork', 'Young', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'beautiful', 'film', 'found', 'accent', 'acceptable', 'not', 'distracting', 'Was', 'expecting', 'butler', 'be', 'real', 'challenge', 'given', 'rep', 'never', 'saw', 'flaw', 'interactions', 'boss', 'kinda', 'wanted', 'see', 'overcome', 'wit', 'confidence', 'sure', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'FD2', 'fighting', 'corruption', 'pork', 'projects', 'smiling', 'constituents', 'oh', 'btw', 'kept', 'talking', 'replacing', 'rep', '15th', 'district', 'signs', 'said', '13th', 'high', 'recommend', 'Young', 'Cotton', 'Barrymore', 'fans', 'swedes', 'would', 'love', 'hear', 'Nordic', 'countries', 'who', 'felt', 'well', 'represented', 'culture']",The Farmer's Daughter 1947  VHS
503365,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00000ICYF,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Odds are, Loretta Young's best role was in THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER. It's certainly my favorite of all her movies, and it won her a Best Actress Academy Award for 1947. And to think she had qualms about taking on this part, not because she had to dye her hair blonde but I think because of the Swedish accent she would have to assume. Did you know she lobbied for a southern accent instead, and was turned down? THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER is based on a Finnish play titled HULDA, DAUGHTER OF PARLIAMENT, and I guess it was too much of a chore to shift from ""ya"" to ""y'all."" But it was a canny choice, sticking to the guns. A southern accent and everything that goes with it would have altered the story's dynamics significantly.Loretta Young plays Katrin Holstrom, the relentlessly resourceful farm girl of Swedish-American stock come to Washington, D.C. to attend nursing school. But mishap in the shape of a weasely, boozy barn painter leaves her with her savings frittered away, and she ends up working as a house maid in a young congressman's ritzy household in D.C.It doesn't take long for that young congressman, Glenn Morley (Joseph Cotton), and his savvy, lived-in mother (a fantastic Ethel Barrymore) to learn that their new maid knows her politics, in fact, knows plenty about plenty. And, unlike the irascible family butler (Charles Bickford, also fantastic), Katrin Holstrom brews a fine pot of coffee and gives a mean Swedish massage. This being more of a romantic comedy fable than an incisive political expos&eacute;, what are the odds that the young congressman and the maid mutually fall head over heels? (The odds are good.)The story conflict surfaces when the congressman's party decides to back an unsavory character to join the ranks. Katrin, never shy about voicing her opinions, disapproves of the party's choice. One thing leads to another, and before you can say ""A mug of hot glug!"" Katrin Holstrom finds herself running for Congress on the opposition's ticket. Talk about your household divided, ya.The politics that Katrin slings about is pretty naive, corny stuff. Essentially, she runs on the platform of decency and fair play and how the representative's actions should be dictated by those he represents. Still, I found it easy enough to be swayed by the sentimentality of it all because the performances are so good, the story unfolds so delightfully, even if you could see the plot points a mile away. The cast is pitch perfect, from the two leads to Ethel Barrymore, the canny matriarch, and the craggy-faced Charles Bickford who himself was nominated as Best Supporting Actor for his butler role. And if you're a trivia-head, two of Katrin's three strapping big brothers are played by a pre-GUNSMOKE James Arness and a pre-Tarzan Lex Barker. THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER, in my opinion, qualifies as unmissable cinema. There's a Frank Capra-esque whiff to this film, and the writers capitalize on it by staging a dizzy third act colored with a vicious smear campaign, a bit of trickeration employed by Ethel Barrymore's character, and a sprawling, anything-goes scrap involving a dirty politician's thugs on one side and our young senator and Katrin's three large brothers on the other. In a skirmish this freewheeling, you're advised to make sure your chad isn't hanging. It's no fun getting kicked in the ballots.",5,politics do make strange bedfellows... sometimes they even make the beds,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,3336,"['Odds', 'are', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'best', 'role', 'was', 'THE', 'FARMER', 'DAUGHTER', 'certainly', 'favorite', 'movies', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', '1947', 'think', 'had', 'qualms', 'taking', 'part', 'not', 'had', 'dye', 'hair', 'blonde', 'think', 'Swedish', 'accent', 'would', 'have', 'assume', 'Did', 'know', 'lobbied', 'southern', 'accent', 'instead', 'was', 'turned', 'down', 'FARMER', 'DAUGHTER', 'based', 'Finnish', 'play', 'titled', 'HULDA', 'DAUGHTER', 'OF', 'PARLIAMENT', 'guess', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'chore', 'shift', 'ya', ""y'all"", 'was', 'canny', 'choice', 'sticking', 'guns', 'southern', 'accent', 'everything', 'would', 'have', 'altered', 'story', 'dynamics', 'significantly.Loretta', 'Young', 'Katrin', 'Holstrom', 'relentlessly', 'resourceful', 'farm', 'girl', 'Swedish-American', 'stock', 'come', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'attend', 'nursing', 'school', 'mishap', 'shape', 'weasely', 'boozy', 'barn', 'painter', 'savings', 'frittered', 'away', 'up', 'working', 'house', 'maid', 'young', 'congressman', 'ritzy', 'household', 'D.C.It', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'young', 'congressman', 'Glenn', 'Morley', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'savvy', 'lived-in', 'mother', 'fantastic', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'learn', 'new', 'maid', 'politics', 'fact', 'plenty', 'plenty', 'irascible', 'family', 'butler', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Katrin', 'Holstrom', 'fine', 'pot', 'coffee', 'mean', 'Swedish', 'massage', 'being', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fable', 'incisive', 'political', 'expos', 'eacute', 'what', 'are', 'odds', 'young', 'congressman', 'maid', 'mutually', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'odds', 'are', 'good', 'story', 'conflict', 'surfaces', 'when', 'congressman', 'party', 'decides', 'back', 'unsavory', 'character', 'join', 'ranks', 'Katrin', 'never', 'shy', 'voicing', 'opinions', 'disapproves', 'party', 'choice', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'A', 'mug', 'hot', 'glug', 'Katrin', 'Holstrom', 'running', 'Congress', 'opposition', 'ticket', 'Talk', 'household', 'divided', 'ya.The', 'politics', 'Katrin', 'slings', 'pretty', 'naive', 'corny', 'stuff', 'Essentially', 'platform', 'decency', 'fair', 'play', 'how', 'representative', 'actions', 'should', 'be', 'dictated', 'Still', 'found', 'easy', 'enough', 'be', 'swayed', 'sentimentality', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'story', 'unfolds', 'so', 'delightfully', 'even', 'could', 'see', 'plot', 'mile', 'away', 'cast', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'two', 'leads', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'canny', 'matriarch', 'craggy-faced', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'butler', 'role', ""'re"", 'trivia-head', 'two', 'Katrin', 'three', 'strapping', 'big', 'brothers', 'are', 'played', 'pre-GUNSMOKE', 'James', 'Arness', 'pre-Tarzan', 'Lex', 'Barker', 'THE', 'FARMER', 'DAUGHTER', 'opinion', 'qualifies', 'unmissable', 'cinema', 'Frank', 'Capra-esque', 'whiff', 'film', 'writers', 'capitalize', 'staging', 'dizzy', 'third', 'act', 'colored', 'vicious', 'smear', 'campaign', 'bit', 'trickeration', 'employed', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'sprawling', 'anything-goes', 'scrap', 'involving', 'dirty', 'politician', 'thugs', 'one', 'side', 'young', 'senator', 'Katrin', 'three', 'large', 'brothers', 'other', 'skirmish', 'freewheeling', ""'re"", 'advised', 'make', 'sure', 'chad', ""n't"", 'hanging', 'fun', 'getting', 'kicked', 'ballots']",The Farmer's Daughter 1947  VHS

503367,A3RUMI4Y58S59,B00000ICYF,Heaven's Hound,"[2, 3]","Loretta Young deserved the Oscar for her role in The Farmer's Daughter.  Young had had a legendary career as one of Hollywood's leading ladies.  Her beauty was extraordinary in a town where beauties were a dime a dozen.  She was underappreciated for her acting prowess.  She knew she was no Bette Davis, but Davis herself when asked about Young's talent, said that she was ""competent.""  I believe she was far more than competent, and this is quite obvious in The Farmer's Daughter, a delightful comedy.  Young was an excellent comedienne, and she holds her own with some of Hollywood's greatest pros: Joe Cotton, Ethel Barrymore and Charles Bickford.  It is remarkable that the year of 1947, Young made two of her best films, The Farmer's Daughter and The Bishop's Wife, the latter is a great film, in which she stars with Gary Grant.  But the film is really hers:  her radiant, almost spiritual beauty, steals the film right from under Gary Grant and David Niven.  The late 1940s were good years for Young one of a few the stars of the Golden Age to survive into the late forties. She then had the brains and the courage to tackle the new medium of TV.  She became the biggest female TV star of the 1950s (she and Lucille Ball).  Who can ever forget her swinging througn her door in a designer gown every week.  Yes, after a while people would sneer, but in those innocent days, she was the apex of sta glamour.  A classy lady who knew how to wear clothes, created by the best designers in Hollywood including Jean Louis her future husband, he who designed Rita Hayworth's gown in Gilda.  Compared to today's crop of stars, Young is peerless in style and beauty.  There are few who have had such a long career, one that spanned more than seventy years.  As a child, she was an extra in a R. Valentino film.  She fondly recalls him as being very kind to the children on the set, taking tham for rides on his horse.  How's that for a Hollywood memory!  Everyone loved her becasue she was down to earh, no prima donna, very like her former co-star Jean Harlow, both of them staring in the film Platinum Blonde, although Young at the time had top-billing.  And continued to have top billing for most of her carrer.  Always an A-list actress.

But when Katie's reputation is besmirched, Cotton & friends gallop to the the rescue.Truly, I think you'll love The Farmer's Daughter; it's not only entertaining but inspiring.I hope that reasonably priced copies are marketed soon, so a whole new generation can enjoy it.This is one you owe yourself. sloanranger-Wattpad.",5,CLASSIC - ROMANCTIC POLITICAL COMEDY - AA BEST ACTRESS,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,1193,"['Farmer', 'Daughter', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'movie', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'AFI', 'top', '100', 'Film', 'List.Credit', 'given', 'other', 'reviewers', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'much', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'win', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Others', 'include', 'two', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'Harry', 'Davenport', 'Welshman', 'Rhys', 'Williams', 'picture', 'full', 'familiar', 'lesser', 'known', 'including', 'early', 'James', 'Arness.Joseph', 'Cotton', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'late', 'begun', 'appreciate', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'likeable', 'congressman', 'Young', 'character', 'Katie', 'work', 'for.A', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'farm', 'girl', 'Katie', 'nursing', 'course', 'when', 'big', 'city', 'then', 'forced', 'take', 'maid', 'job', 'politico', 'mansion', 'Conflict', 'when', 'Katie', 'induced', 'run', 'congress', 'smitten', 'Senator', 'Cotton', 'opposing', 'party', 'when', 'Katie', 'reputation', 'besmirched', 'Cotton', 'friends', 'gallop', 'rescue.Truly', 'think', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', 'not', 'only', 'entertaining', 'inspiring.I', 'hope', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'copies', 'are', 'marketed', 'soon', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'can', 'enjoy', 'it.This', 'one', 'owe', 'sloanranger-Wattpad']",The Farmer's Daughter 1947  VHS

503377,A1C80B497LCYKA,B00000ICYF,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[6, 7]","In an election year when most voters are wondering which candidate is the least dishonest, which is the lesser evil, The Farmer's Daughter is not only refreshing but instructive. It contrasts a political ""machine"" with a lone, honest voice crying in the political wilderness. Katie is that voice. She is the attractive housemaid of a powerful but amiable family, called the Morleys, who have been running their party's political machine for generations.As one might assume, the Morleys entertain many influential people; but Katie doesn't mind listening to their conversations and interjecting her political views as she hands them a drink or canap&eacute;. Everyone is taken aback by her candor except for the son, Glenn, who is fascinated by Katie, and eventually falls in love with her, as she does with him. He takes her under his wing and encourages her to improve herself by taking night classes. In one class, she has to give a speech, which has her worried; but the family butler, Joseph, who is like another member of the family, introduces her to a little speech once delivered in the Senate by Glenn's deceased father. Katie's simple reading of it moves Joseph and Mrs. Morley.Eventually, the family realizes that Katie does not approve of their party's candidate for Congress, and she speaks out against him in a town meeting. When the opposition party hears her, and likes what they hear, they talk her into running on their ticket. Katie's three brothers leave the family farm to come and help with her campaign. But it doesn't go well at first; until Glenn advises that she stay honest by being herself. Then the Morleys unwittingly buy into a smear campaign to destroy Katie's candidacy, which causes Glenn to leave the party and fight to clear her name.Loretta Young plays the naive but wonderfully wise Katie, and it earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. Amazingly, 1947 was also the year she appeared in The Bishop's Wife, another great classic. Joseph Cotton plays the good-hearted Glenn, who was captain of Yale's greatest hockey team and is now following in his father's footsteps as Senator. Ethel Barrymore is Glenn's world-wise mother, Agatha, the family matriarch, who spots character in Katie and isn't above making side bets with the family butler, Joseph. Charles Bickford is memorable as Joseph, for which he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Lex Barker (Tarzan), Keith Andes (Clash By Night) and James Arness (Gunsmoke) play Katie's strapping brothers, who are terrific in a knock-down, drag-out fight with the bad guys.Director H. C. Potter's filmmaking career lasted for little more than ten years; but he is distinguished for not only this film but also Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948), with Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. (Lex Barker is in that film as well.) The Farmer's Daughter was a play by Hella Wuolijoki (Juhni Tervataa), that was adapted for the screen by Allen Rivkin and Laura Kerr. The dialogue is snappy and witty, and the situations fun. It was later turned into a TV show that was entertaining but lost a great deal in translation.The Farmer's Daughter is smartly insightful. It shows that when We the People are honest, it makes honest politicians possible; but when We the People are corrupt, so are our politicians. Katie, an honest politician, was able to rise to the surface because the people around her were basically honest. That is a great lesson to us in this year of dishonest and disappointing politics.Waitsel Smith",5,KATIE FOR CONGRESS - an Honest Politician and a Great Movie,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,3500,"['election', 'year', 'when', 'most', 'voters', 'are', 'wondering', 'candidate', 'least', 'dishonest', 'lesser', 'evil', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', 'not', 'only', 'refreshing', 'instructive', 'political', 'machine', 'lone', 'honest', 'voice', 'crying', 'political', 'wilderness', 'Katie', 'voice', 'attractive', 'housemaid', 'powerful', 'amiable', 'family', 'called', 'Morleys', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'running', 'party', 'political', 'machine', 'generations.As', 'one', 'might', 'assume', 'Morleys', 'entertain', 'many', 'influential', 'people', 'Katie', ""n't"", 'mind', 'listening', 'conversations', 'interjecting', 'political', 'views', 'drink', 'canap', 'eacute', 'Everyone', 'taken', 'aback', 'candor', 'son', 'Glenn', 'who', 'fascinated', 'Katie', 'eventually', 'love', 'wing', 'improve', 'taking', 'night', 'classes', 'one', 'class', 'give', 'speech', 'worried', 'family', 'butler', 'Joseph', 'who', 'member', 'family', 'little', 'speech', 'once', 'delivered', 'Senate', 'Glenn', 'deceased', 'father', 'Katie', 'simple', 'reading', 'Joseph', 'Mrs.', 'Morley.Eventually', 'family', 'Katie', 'not', 'approve', 'party', 'candidate', 'Congress', 'out', 'town', 'meeting', 'When', 'opposition', 'party', 'what', 'hear', 'talk', 'running', 'ticket', 'Katie', 'three', 'brothers', 'leave', 'family', 'farm', 'come', 'help', 'campaign', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'first', 'Glenn', 'stay', 'honest', 'being', 'Then', 'Morleys', 'unwittingly', 'buy', 'smear', 'campaign', 'destroy', 'Katie', 'candidacy', 'Glenn', 'leave', 'party', 'fight', 'clear', 'name.Loretta', 'Young', 'naive', 'wonderfully', 'wise', 'Katie', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Amazingly', '1947', 'was', 'also', 'year', 'appeared', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'great', 'classic', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'good-hearted', 'Glenn', 'who', 'was', 'captain', 'Yale', 'greatest', 'hockey', 'team', 'now', 'following', 'father', 'footsteps', 'Senator', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'Glenn', 'world-wise', 'mother', 'Agatha', 'family', 'matriarch', 'who', 'spots', 'character', 'Katie', ""n't"", 'making', 'side', 'bets', 'family', 'butler', 'Joseph', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'memorable', 'Joseph', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Lex', 'Barker', 'Tarzan', 'Keith', 'Andes', 'Clash', 'Night', 'James', 'Arness', 'Gunsmoke', 'play', 'Katie', 'strapping', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'terrific', 'knock-down', 'drag-out', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys.Director', 'H.', 'C.', 'Potter', 'filmmaking', 'career', 'lasted', 'little', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'distinguished', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'also', 'Mr.', 'Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', '1948', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Lex', 'Barker', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', 'was', 'play', 'Hella', 'Wuolijoki', 'Juhni', 'Tervataa', 'was', 'adapted', 'screen', 'Allen', 'Rivkin', 'Laura', 'Kerr', 'dialogue', 'snappy', 'witty', 'situations', 'fun', 'was', 'later', 'turned', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'entertaining', 'lost', 'great', 'deal', 'translation.The', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', 'smartly', 'insightful', 'when', 'People', 'are', 'honest', 'honest', 'politicians', 'possible', 'when', 'People', 'are', 'corrupt', 'so', 'are', 'politicians', 'Katie', 'honest', 'politician', 'was', 'able', 'rise', 'surface', 'people', 'were', 'basically', 'honest', 'great', 'lesson', 'year', 'dishonest', 'disappointing', 'politics.Waitsel', 'Smith']",The Farmer's Daughter 1947  VHS
