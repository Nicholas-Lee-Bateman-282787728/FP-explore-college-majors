THE UNBROKEN is another bland and boring ghost story that falls back on all of the same tired cliches the genre has to offer. Lead actress Aurelia Riley tries desperately to inject some energy into an otherwise lifeless production, which is brought down further by Daniel Baldwin as the film's unconvincing villain. The special effects also fail to impress, with the sparing use of cheap make-up and broken glass added for the occasional fright. If one can overcome the lengthy opening, there is at least enough action in the final act to drag the audience grudgingly through to the end.

1638242,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00BTFK09G,Matthew Scott Baker,"[11, 12]","I've mentioned this before in some of my previous book reviews, but I am an absolute sucker for a good ghost story; as such, the same can be said for ghost movies as well.  The problem is that they seem to be few and far between.  With modern-day films about ghosts, we many times get rehashed genre staples that don't break any new ground.  Fortunately, THE UNBROKEN does not adhere to that description.  Although not perfect, this film does entertain, if you can make your way through it.I have to tell you up front that it was sorta difficult for me to get through the first 3/4 of this film.  Overall, the movie is pretty well done...but the acting started bugging me pretty quickly into it.  This is particularly true for the character of Tommy, portrayed by Patrick Flanagan.  Whether it is his acting style or the scriptwriting, the dialogue he presents just seems forced and unrealistic.But, THE UNBROKEN does keep you intrigued enough along the way to look past that.  The mystery that Sarah instantly becomes involved with is interesting and kept me guessing right up to the end.  No matter what I thought was happening in the film, I was wrong, and it was a nice twist at the end that made me smile in appreciation.The film is shot well and the special effects look pretty good, especially considering the lower-ended budget.  The acting, as mentioned above, is where the film stalls for me, though.  I would not consider it to be enough of a deterrent to keep you from watching the film, but I do have to warn you in advance not to expect Oscar-worthy performances.Still, if you can find the will-power to muster through THE UNBROKEN, the ending should justify your time (for the most part).  I'm going to give a neutral recommendation on this one, however, because some folks may not want to devote an hour and 40 minutes to this.  But I enjoyed it and am glad I fought to the end.

1638244,AQ2UN38CMK119,B00BTFK09G,P. Mann,"[0, 0]","Sarah Campbell (played by Aurelia Riley) is an artist who is now on her own after her ex cheats on her. As she drives to inspect an apartment, she nearly runs over a boy. Or does she? When she gets out of the vehicle, all she finds in front of her car is a clown doll. When she moves in, strange things start to happen, and she begins to see the boy. With the assistance of the landlord's grown son, she tries to rid herself of the ghost. As part of these efforts, she visits a shop run by a psychic (Warwick Davis of the Leprechaun and Harry Potter films). At first, his suggestions seem to work. That's at first. Throughout all of this, Sarah is trying to figure out what the ghostly child wants and what the story is about her creepy neighbor (played by Daniel Baldwin).The ending of the film is, I imagine, supposed to be a big twist. It's clever, though not unprecedented. And I suppose there was a sense among the makers that the ending was on a par with that of The Sixth Sense. But if they did think so, they were, I think, unduly optimistic.There is a fair amount to like here. I think Daniel Baldwin is generally solid (though it's hard to understand his thought process in selecting roles given that he was in both Stripperland and Christmas with a Capital C in 2011), and he does about as much as he can with this role. The plot is, as I said, clever. And the three main actors do a solid job (other reviews here notwithstanding). The problem, though, is that the film could have been so much more. It could have been scarier; true scares are few here. (That's probably because the film is so light. Most of the scenes take place during daylight.) The mystery of the ending could have been more firmly established so that it becomes a true &#34;wow&#34; ending.
