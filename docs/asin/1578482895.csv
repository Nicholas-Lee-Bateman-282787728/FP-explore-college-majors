In fact, I finally got a DVD player this Christmas (a week ago, in 2006).  Yes, when it comes to ""getting with the times"" you can say I'm pretty slow, but this movie will now go down in history as the first DVD I've ever had, and that alone makes the overall rating jump from a 4 to a 5.This is the kind of movie that's scary in the Scooby Doo style.  No, I don't mean the Scooby Doo movies with Sarah Michelle Gellar (who's totally hot, by the way) I mean the old cartoon series.  Remember when you had to guess who the bad guy was?  It's like that.The 4th Floor is about a woman who moves into an apartment building, and to her surprise, the entire building features strange people.  In fact, not a single person in that building is normal.  Out of all these unusual people, only one of them is responsible for messing with the woman who just moved in.  The room below from the woman is how the movie got its name, because that's where the crazy person lives.Supposedly, this crazy person never comes out of their room.  So when the woman in the floor above has to deal with the many irritating problems from the person below (such as constantly beating on the ceiling) this is when the woman decides she wants to know who lives in the room below, and confront them.  This is where the suspense comes in.It's almost like a horror plot, but not quite.  It's more along the lines of suspense and mystery.It's an enjoyable movie, worth watching more than once.",5,great suspense,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,1540,"['will', 'never', 'believe', '4th', 'Floor', 'was', 'first', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'owned', 'fact', 'finally', 'got', 'DVD', 'player', 'Christmas', 'week', 'ago', '2006', 'Yes', 'when', 'getting', 'times', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'slow', 'movie', 'will', 'now', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'first', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'alone', 'overall', 'rating', 'jump', '4', '5.This', 'kind', 'movie', 'scary', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'style', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movies', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'who', 'totally', 'hot', 'way', 'mean', 'old', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Remember', 'when', 'had', 'guess', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', '4th', 'Floor', 'woman', 'who', 'apartment', 'building', 'surprise', 'entire', 'building', 'features', 'strange', 'people', 'fact', 'not', 'single', 'person', 'building', 'normal', 'unusual', 'people', 'only', 'one', 'responsible', 'messing', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'room', 'woman', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'name', 'where', 'crazy', 'person', 'lives.Supposedly', 'crazy', 'person', 'never', 'room', 'So', 'when', 'woman', 'floor', 'deal', 'many', 'irritating', 'problems', 'person', 'such', 'constantly', 'beating', 'ceiling', 'when', 'woman', 'know', 'who', 'room', 'confront', 'where', 'suspense', 'in.It', 'almost', 'horror', 'plot', 'not', 'quite', 'more', 'lines', 'suspense', 'mystery.It', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once']",The 4th Floor

Her excitement soon wears off, though, when she starts receiving anonymous letters asking her to keep her noise levels down.  Initally she complies with the requests (whom she suspects are coming from the unseen neighbor on the 4th floor below) until the requests become too demanding and unreasonable.The requests escalate until they turn to a final threat that reads, ""Warnings are over"".  From here on, we're taken on an eerie ride as we watch our protagonist receive threat after dangerous threat until her very life is at stake.  As if that weren't bad enough, no one believes her when she asks for help -- not her boyfriend, not her lawyer, not even the police.  And because of that, she starts to question her own sanity.This was an intriguing story from start to finish, but I only gave it 4 stars - as opposed to 5 -  for two reasons.  One, I thought the acting was just ok.  In the beginning, Juliette Lewis's performance felt amateurish compared to the more mature acting by William Hurt.  By the end, though, it does improve.  I thought the landlord's son and the blonde female tenant downstairs overacted.  However, William Hurt and the actor who plays the neighbor across the street did a fine job.The second reason for only 4 stars is that when Juliette is finally confronted by the killer, the sequence of events that follow border on the absurd.

I paid about $6 for this dvd which I thoroughly enjoyed the first time I rented it. This budget version differs from the original A Pix version: There are no commentaries/alternate endings with this Sterling version. If you want those extras, you'll have to buy the other version. No captioning bothered me since I am so used to having that option. But since I listen with headphones, this isn't a problem. Picture quality is very good with some slight grain. Audio is 2ch despite what is printed on the keep case: Dolby Digital Stereo, it isn't. Minor complaints however considering the first-rate cast and excellent performances by all: Juliette Lewis as our victim-who-gets-run-through-the-mill by a creepy neighbor(Austin Pendleton), William Hurt as her 'I warned you' boyfriend, Shelly Duvall as the nosy oddball landlady. There is of course the apartment building with a long history and sinister feel about it, darkly-lit as well. I was reminded a lot of 'Rear Window'.

The landlady (Shelley Duvall) is a bit of a busybody. There is an elderly couple that are a bit blind and deaf. Mr. Collins (Austin Pendleton) is a kindly old man who likes his privacy, but seems to have taken a shine to Jane.Jane frequently looks out her window at the interesting tenets across the way, who in turn watch their building. Here lives the creepy locksmith, (Tobin Bell) who services both buildings.Jane gets threatening notes about her noise from the 80 year old woman who lives below her. Then weird things happen which escalate.The acting was alright, although I would have rather seen Kidman play Jane. The action moves at a smart pace.
