What makes it so compelling is that he allows the internationalists to speak for themselves through video clips. He has articulate scholars from economics, climatology, and others speak on their area of expertise. The production and editing are outstanding, and Alex Jones speaks to his audience in an interview style that sheds furter light on what others have previously stated.What makes this film so different from others hes produced is that he allows others to dominate. Alex has always been a passionate speaker and gifted film maker. However, by allowing others to dominate this film he has created fact machine that will prove next to impossible for anyone seeking truth to find fault with. If you really want to understand what is happening in the world minus the spin from the talking heads on television, watch this film. 5 stars hands down.P.S.

1286134,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B002RXAER2,Annie Feng,"[17, 41]","As one reviewer so brilliantly pointed out, this documentary is an ""Excellent gift for those who don't read books."" In other words, if you don't know anything, whatever repetitive bulcrap they whisper in your ear you're just gonna nod your head, especially if they repeat it long enough. Just to give one example, this one guy with a beard who speaks in this weird accent says: ""competition is a sin"" and then, 30 seconds later: ""because competition is a sin, because it is a sin"" 30 minutes later into watching this, I was still waiting for any concrete evidence. Believe me people, there is none, just a bunch of people giving their (unprofessional) opinions, and clips of biased ""admissions"" from various people. Such as in this one clip it shows some guy who says: ""no I don't support that"" and then the clip was immediately cut off. In other words, we don't get to see his reasons for not supporting, you know, in case it makes too much sense.I also find it hilarious that the documentary keeps showing clips from the Great Depression (you know, the 1930s) to show us just how bad the situation America is in right now. What's the matter Alex? you can't find clips from the recent years that can bolester your points?The Fall of the Republic is a right-wing propaganda anti-global-government documentary. It features a bunch of people with little or not credentials in economics or politics, to talk unsupportive, meaningless assertions that anyone with a brain could see through. I could just point out one of them: the claim that Franklin Roosevelt takes credit for pulling the American people out of the depression because ""he brought something new and good."" Did people also forget that the Americans also greatly benefited from WWII? Before WWII (and in case some of my readers aren't aware, was centuries AFTER the constitution was drafted), the Great Britain was the world power. But Americans enjoyed peace while Europe was being bombed, and then during the middle of the war Americans suddenly (after Pearl Harbor) decided to help out, and during the process, found jobs from building the military. Meanwhile, you have geniuses like Einestein who fled to the ""peaceful country"" and boosted American scientific research and academia. Needless to say, America got ahead, through the luck of geography and events.That doesn't mean that the constitution doesn't have anything to do with it, of course it does. The American constitution is drafted to establish a stable government that guarrantee people's basic rights. How can we pledge allegiance to the constitution but then at the same time be anti-government? who is going to make sure we have those freedoms? Do people honestly think that private organizations that run for profits will? Now, of course there is always corruption in the government, but that's why we need a check-and-balance system, but what's with this blaming everything on Obama? I noticed that these people conviniently left out all the mistakes the Repulicans and the Bush administration did, which is leaving the country in trillions of dollar in debt, and then blaming Obama for not solving it in 4 years. I do think that Obama should be less of a wuss and less compromising in his ideas, but what can he do when he needs money and the only rich people are the greedy people who owns private sectors, who also have the majority, if not all, republicans (basically half of congress) behind their backs?I find it really funny that every single time someone like Bill Maher brings people who supports his, and the democratic's position, he brings on law professors from Ivy-league schools, economics professors from UC Berkeley etc. While on this documentary we have people from ""maxkaiser.com"" and the person with the best credential is this guy from...the University of Missouri, Kansas City, you know, the place where the documentary, Jesus Camp, is filmed. Is it really far-fetched to say that maybe one position really does hold more water than the other one? such as the fact that some things, such as the police, social security, health care, SHOULD be run by the government? The fact that during an economic crisis, cutting taxes for the rich will plunger the economy (ask yourself just this ONE question: if you know that the economy is currently plungering, are you going to SPEND more money, or SAVE more money? I can guarantee you that you will do the latter), becaus the most the rich will do is, in the best cases, not to lay off anybody he hires, and he will ONLY do that when he can still make profit AND he happens to be a really nice person. We have a general consensus from all the economics experts that the economy is based on consumer-ism, which means that, if people don't buy, economy crashes, it doesn't matter if you have enough money to hire people, and in such scenario you won't hire people anyways, there would be nothing for them to do.Most of the documentary is discrediting the idea of a ""global economy,"" and then they will say something like: ""nobody is taking care of Africa..."" who would ""take care of Africa"" if not a global organization? Did people forget that the reason why we don't have a WWIII with everybody bombing everybody else using atomic bombs is BECAUSE now we have this thing called THE UNITED NATIONS? where we talk out our problems in our countries and collectively make a decision? I also find it really ironic that the people who are so anti-government also tend to be oh so pro-American-Military-empire. Most of the republicans who criticize Obama are also for American troops staying all over the world to ""protect us from immense danger and promot democracy,"" or, in other words, GOVERNING everybody else using military power.Look, we all want free-market economy, the kind that no one will hold monopoly on a product, but non-government-interfering capatalism will always result in monopoly, why? because people naturally do not hold onto integrity when they are competiting. How many of you in the work place have not experienced a situation in which someone will tell you keep quiet, when you know something is clearly unethical and should be spoken out about? Without government interferring, what will happen, beyond a doubt, is that one company will win, outcompeting eveybody else, and then hold a monopoly on that product, which it will self-regulate (aka. demand higher and higher prices), especially on things such as health-care, which everybody needs, because EVERYBODY will get sick at least sometimes in their lifetime. I propose that lawyers and car insurance companies should also be government regulated, in this way when a company gets too powerful, it will not have the power to bribe a top-lawyer with high pay to block somebody else from competiting with them.And yes, we need a global government, we need a government that will insure peace throughout the world. This government will have to have a check-and-balance system of course. What people don't realize is, at the very least, the role of the government is non-profitable, when we start to do everything on our own, we always will think of ""profit"" that's just human nature, it happened throughout history, go look it up.",1,"A pile of repetitive, non-evidence ramblings that don't hold water",1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,7195,"['one', 'reviewer', 'so', 'brilliantly',

1286139,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B002RXAER2,Howard M. Kindel,"[6, 9]","I see no disconnect in rating this documentary five stars yet, at the same time, having serious reservations about its content.  The five stars are for a first-rate documentary; in ""Fall of the Republic"" Alex Jones is at the top of his game.  The reservations stem from the same prickly point that colors virtually every documentary Jones has ever made:  his adamant, almost virulent, climate-change denial.  He may be 100% right; this whole climate-change movement may be nothing but a stratagem by the One Worlders to undercut every nation's sovereignty with a Carbon Tax.  The thing is, Jones never presents any significant geological or archeological or even astronomical evidence to support his contention; he offers only the vagueries of the sun's coronal activity to explain away every piece of evidence used to support climate-change.  Forgive me for being a ""Doubting Thomas"" but I need more evidence than the sun's corona - which, even today, is only partially understood.  I've seen documentaries showing various scientists gathering evidence from rocks, from tree rings, from ice deposits, even from bones and other relics which tend to support the climate-change paradigm; and I've also seen evidence showing melting polar ice, warming ocean waters, rising sea levels.  These things are commonplace nowadays.  Jones would say that these things, which look for the world like evidence, are nothing more than manipulations of natural phenomena to convince the public to go along with the New World Order and its nefarious agenda.  Again, he may be on the mark; but, I'm sorry, I need more than his doubts and a few sunspots to convince me that virtually every bit of science in the last two decades is merely part of a big propaganda ploy.  To be absolutely blunt about it, Alex Jones looks as much like a shill for big oil as a freedom fighter out to inform the American people what's been happening to our country and to warn them what's coming.So, the question for me is simply: can someone be a shill for big oil and still be taken seriously?  To which I have to answer: yes, he can.  Though the target of his reporting is almost exclusively international finance; and though he seems to consistently give big oil a free pass; these two disparate ideas are not mutually exclusive.  Regardless how big oil fits into the picture, the financial community has, through its recent actions, effectively revealed itself as the single greatest threat, not only to our freedom, but to the sovereignty of virtually every nation on the planet.  And because this is so, it isn't necessary for Alex Jones or anyone else to ferret out every possible danger before exposing big finance for what it is.  Besides, big oil at least deals in a real (i.e., physically tangible) commodity; whereas big finance deals in a commodity which does not exist except in people's minds.  True, it's always said that money merely represents actual physical commodities, thus relieving people of the necessity of trading and bartering actual goods.  However, has anyone ever shown where all the quad-trillions of ""goods"" the world's currencies represent are actually located?  Especially, considering how much of anticipated future goods enter into the currency reckoning.  If ever there was such a thing as ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" it's in the way big finance parades around pretending it's commodity - money - represents anything more real or worth more than the paper on which it's printed.And just as Alex Jones is on the mark in his depiction of the financial community; so, too, is he in his depiction of America's political establishment.  All one has to do is follow the news to realize that virtually every elected or appointed official is lock, stock and barrel in corporate America's back pocket.  It's not hyperbole to say that no one in Washington is working primarily for the benefit of the American people.  The only point of contention is whether this has simply evolved over time or whether, as Jones contends, this state of affairs is the result of a deliberate plot by certain global interests to eviscerate the constitution of the United States - as well as the constitutions of every other nation - in order to establish a one-world government which enshrines international finance while enslaving the world's peoples.  Here again, his contention would carry greater weight if this one-world cabal included more than just financial interests.  But, as always, he stops short of including big oil or any other major industry in this New World Order paradigm.  And that reluctance on his part, unfortunately, tends to undercut his message.UPDATE:  Over the course of the last couple months - especially since ""Occupy Wall Street"" became a major topic of conversation - I've detected yet another troubling aspect of Alex Jones' worldview.  He has clearly revealed himself to be a champion of the rich - something I hadn't noticed previously.  When ""Occupy Wall Street"" began, Mr Jones' news notes on his ""Prison Planet"" site seemed to be supportive.  Now, however, he's begun dissing the entire thing as an attempt to redistribute wealth downward.  Well, excuse me, Mr Jones, but haven't you been saying all along that Wall Street has redistributed wealth upward?  So where's the problem in the American people reclaiming some of it?  Sorry, Mr Jones, but there's something fishy going on here.  Perhaps you, too, have a hidden agenda?UPDATE 2:  I'm more convinced than ever that Alex Jones is primarily a shill for Big Oil.  He's running articles on his website which are without exception highly critical of anyone who tries to keep the proposed Keystone Pipeline from being built.  There's tremendous opposition to it - from ordinary citizens as well as scientists and certain government figures.  Jones' website offers this pipeline as a great opportunity for the American people to get much needed Canadian oil; but never mentions the enormous risks of deriving oil from Alberta ""tar sands"" or the risk of transporting it down the center of the United States.  It's abundantly clear that Mr Jones includes Big Oil out of the New World Order paradigm.  Big Oil, it appears, can do no wrong.UPDATE 3:  Add to the list of my growing disenchantment with Alex Jones his handling of the Trayvon Martin killing.  Judging by the tenor of articles appearing on his website, he appears to be leaning toward the uber-conservative - and thoroughly racist - view that Mr Zimmerman was yet another white victim of black thuggery.  One simply cannot turn truth so completely on its head and retain even a shred of credibility. I have given Jones the benefit of the doubt far too long. There are now far too many reservations to maintain a five-star rating.  Jones is still a very accomplished filmmaker; but what he has to say becomes less and less relevant with each new headline.  The expression ""All dressed up with nowhere to go"" comes to mind.",3,Just The Facts Please,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,6942,"['see', 'disconnect', 'rating', 'documentary', 'five', 'stars', 'yet',

However, whether you agree with the conclusions or not, you should know about alternative views of the events from what is presented via mainstream press.I acknowledge that it's possible to fall into a temptation to impose your own view on the events and secretive meetings. I recommend taking cautious approach to such documentaries, but nevertheless to be patient and watch them, and investigate for yourself, taking various views into consideration.This video is seems to be a sequel to the ""Obama Deception"", and casts many same individuals interviewed there. This is good. I like the fact that newer films by Jones include more interviewed people.Among good parts are the ones that criticize federal reserve for lack of transparency, obvious and constant Obama's contradictions, and analysis of the effects of mass media on mass manipulation.When it comes to global warming, I can't be certain because I don't know enough about it. I would take stand that it is too soon to make laws that are built on presumed fact of global warming. Obviously Al Gore is into making a big buck on that, and there are some very scary laws about global warming under consideration.Whatever the case, I think lots of information is rather informative, and even if you don't think NWO is real threat or something negative, simply watch this documentary and keep in mind what you saw.

I have memberships to both Prison Planet and Infowars, in fact I get a large percentage of my news from those sites. I used to have my doubts about a lot of what Alex was saying but 9/11 changed all of that. Since the investigation into 9/11 I have been a firm believer in the vast majority of content coming out of the Alex Jones camp. Things are not as they seem and the US is under attack. There are very powerful groups out there that want the US Dollar to fail so it can be replaced by a global currency. For those who don't believe this just look at what recently happened in regards to purchasing oil with US dollars.The Bottom line - Obama is not the savior many were hoping he would be and this documentary explains how we are in the final stages of the Elites plan for a one world order and a global currency. It explains this new world order in detail and explains what we can still do to stop it.If your a fan of Alex Jones then you wont want to miss this one. In all honest this was not as good as some of his other, more recent, releases but it was still very good and is still absolutely worth seeing. If it were up to me I would make every US citizen watch this along with a lot of his previous releases.
