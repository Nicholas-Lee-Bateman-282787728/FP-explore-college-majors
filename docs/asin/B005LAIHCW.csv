Mark Tonderai's new thriller loses itself in tired old cliches that have long since lost their appeal. The film is terribly miscast, forcing Elisabeth Shue and Jennifer Lawrence into an awkward mother/daughter relationship that feels very unnatural on screen. Max Thieriot's mousy performance is rather unconvincing as well, and lacks the impact needed in order to leave a lasting impression. The supposed twists offer few surprises, especially for audiences that have already seen the same story played out in a hundred different ways. This drains the film of any suspense, while the lapses in logic and poor decision making by the characters are sure to infuriate viewers.

1469859,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B005LAIHCW,CinemaMinor,"[0, 1]","(Warning: contains some spoilers)  Take a little Psycho, a little Sleepaway Camp, a little Halloween, and you have a lot of this movie.  For those familiar with the horror genre, the first 20 minutes pretty much let you know how the story is going to end.  I will say that the first half of the movie does a good job of creating a creepy, unsettling feeling (thanks to the camera work), but at about the one hour mark, things considerably lose steam...I couldn't believe that there were 40 minutes left.  One of the issues is that in most movies where there's a ""big reveal"" it's saved for the very end.  This movie gradually lets the viewer in on the mystery in a way that kills whatever suspense was established during those very decent first 60 minutes.  I'm purposely being vague because I don't want to give too much away, but the fact is there aren't many directions for the bare bones storyline to take.  Mother and teenage daughter are looking to start a new life...move into a new house...patricide occurred in the house next door...body of murderer never found...brother of murderer/son of murdered still living in the same creepy house in which his parents were killed...teenage daughgter falls for this ostracized, sensitive young man who is keeping a secret from her which the audience is let in on.  This is all laid out in about the first half hour.  There are some twists, but as I said they occur well before the movie ends.  Another problem, in terms of creating an excess of mystery, is that the movie involves very few characters: Jennifer Lawrence as the teenage daughter, Elisabeth Shue as her mother, and Max Thierot as Ryan the troubled boy next door share probably 90% of the total dialogue and camera time.  A good horror movie is hard to find lately and this isn't a bad one; it's just not a very original one.  There's even a friendly, small-town stock police character so brilliantly satirized in Scream.  Maybe all of the good ideas have been taken.  The movie was clearly made for a teenage audience and if you haven't seen many other horror movies, you may feel it holds more suspense than I did. There's no getting around how basic the storyline is, but considering that, the acting is good and particularly during the first half of the film there are some unnerving shots (not really any gore...definitely PG-13).",3,"Effectively creepy at times, but as derivative as its title suggests",1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,2347,"['Warning', 'spoilers', 'Take', 'little', 'Psycho', 'little', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'little', 'Halloween', 'have', 'lot', 'movie', 'familiar', 'horror', 'genre', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'much', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'story', 'going', 'end', 'will', 'say', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'creepy', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'thanks', 'camera', 'work', 'one', 'hour', 'mark', 'things', 'considerably', 'lose', 'steam', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'were', '40', 'minutes', 'left', 'One', 'issues', 'most', 'movies', 'where', 'big', 'reveal', 'saved', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'gradually', 'viewer', 'mystery', 'way', 'suspense', 'was', 'established', 'very', 'decent', 'first', '60', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'purposely', 'being', 'vague', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'fact', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'directions', 'bare', 'storyline', 'take', 'Mother', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'are', 'looking', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'patricide', 'occurred', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'body', 'murderer', 'never', 'found', 'brother', 'murderer/son', 'murdered', 'still', 'living', 'same', 'creepy', 'house', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'teenage', 'daughgter', 'ostracized', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'keeping', 'secret', 'audience', 'let', 'laid', 'out', 'first', 'hour', 'are', 'twists', 'said', 'occur', 'well', 'movie', 'problem', 'terms', 'creating', 'excess', 'mystery', 'movie', 'very', 'few', 'characters', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'mother', 'Max', 'Thierot', 'Ryan', 'troubled', 'boy', 'door', 'share', 'probably', '90', '%', 'total', 'dialogue', 'camera', 'time', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'hard', 'find', 'lately', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'one', 'even', 'friendly', 'small-town', 'stock', 'police', 'character', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'satirized', 'Scream', 'Maybe', 'good', 'ideas', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'movie', 'was', 'clearly', 'made', 'teenage', 'audience', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'may', 'feel', 'more', 'suspense', 'did', 'getting', 'around', 'how', 'basic', 'storyline', 'considering', 'acting', 'good', 'particularly', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'are', 'unnerving', 'shots', 'not', 'really', 'gore', 'definitely', 'PG-13']",House at the End of the Street

1469873,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B005LAIHCW,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[3, 5]","Producers of ""House at the End of the Street"" couldn't buy better advertising for their low-budget thriller. First, the movie is given a boost by the success of ""The Hunger Games"" and the spotlight it shined on Jennifer Lawrence. Secondly, Lawrence wins a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical a mere five days after the movie's release on Blu-ray and DVD. This further guarantees that more people who weren't familiar with the star now are and will likely give any project she's in a chance.Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) and her mother (Elisabeth Shue) move to the suburbs to start a new life. They lease a home in an upper-middle class neighborhood that's affordable to them because of the horrific murders that took place in the house next door. A few years before, a girl killed her mother and father there before running out into the woods and disappearing. She's been long thought dead, but some residents believe she still lives in the woods next to the neighborhood. Elissa befriends the killer's brother, Ryan (Max Thieriot), against her mother's wishes. She soon discovers the boy might be hiding a dark secret from her and the rest of the town.If ""House at the End of the Street"" is guilty of anything, it's trying to be everything to everyone. It feels as if writers David Loucka and Jonathan Mostow couldn't figure out what genre they wanted to tackle, so they just touched on all of them. While sometimes this can work, it really creates a schizophrenic vibe here. They throw in everything AND the kitchen sink. We get a pinch of slasher films, a handful of ingredients from both thriller and suspense movies, and it gets topped off with the recently overused twist ending everyone's come to expect from these types of movies.The pacing is erratic under the helm of director Mark Tonderai. However, I'll give credit where credit is due. The camerawork helps to redeem it by capturing a sense of creepy nostalgia thanks to cinematographer Miroslaw Baszak. He chose to use a type of film that makes it look grainy and similar to older classic horror movies.Jennifer Lawrence puts forth her best effort in the role of flirty and rebellious teen Elissa. Max Thieriot is convincing as the enigmatic Ryan. He's both creepy and charming at the same time, which can be hard to pull off by some actors. Elisabeth Shue does an adequate job portraying the concerned, yet distant mother. Although, she sometimes feels a little disconnected from the role.The high-definition audio and video transfer for the movie is excellent. The grainy, ""real"" film look isn't tainted by the Blu-ray treatment. The 5.1 surround mix gives viewers plenty of sounds to immerse themselves in. This is very much a movie that relies on loud bumps and noises for its scares and won't let the home audience down in that respect.There's not much here when it comes to bonus material for the ""House at the End of the Street"" Blu-ray. They include a near-10-minute""making of"" featurette entitled ""Journey Into Terror: Inside 'House at the End of the Street,'"" and a theatrical trailer. It also features the unrated and theatrical version of the movie.I'm not going to say that ""House at the End of the Street"" doesn't have some enjoyable moments or isn't worth your time. It's just more of the same thing we've come to expect from these types of films. It's like a meal you walk away from full but not satisfied. Nothing you ate was necessarily bad, it just wasn't fantastic. It's one of those PG-13 thriller films we'll see being played repeatedly on the Lifetime Movie Network in a year or so.",3,"Blu-ray Review: ""House at the End of the Street""",1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,3583,"['Producers', 'House', 'End', 'Street', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'better', 'advertising', 'low-budget', 'thriller', 'First', 'movie', 'given', 'boost', 'success', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'spotlight', 'shined', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Secondly', 'Lawrence', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Comedy', 'Musical', 'mere', 'five', 'days', 'movie', 'release', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'further', 'guarantees', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'star', 'now', 'are', 'will', 'likely', 'give', 'project', 'chance.Elissa', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'mother', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'move', 'suburbs', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'lease', 'home', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'neighborhood', 'affordable', 'horrific', 'murders', 'took', 'place', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'few', 'years', 'before', 'girl', 'killed', 'mother', 'father', 'there', 'before', 'running', 'out', 'woods', 'disappearing', 'been', 'long', 'thought', 'dead', 'residents', 'believe', 'still', 'woods', 'neighborhood', 'Elissa', 'killer', 'brother', 'Ryan', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'mother', 'wishes', 'soon', 'boy', 'might', 'be', 'hiding', 'dark', 'secret', 'rest', 'town.If', 'House', 'End', 'Street', 'guilty', 'anything', 'trying', 'be', 'everything', 'everyone', 'writers', 'David', 'Loucka', 'Jonathan', 'Mostow', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'genre', 'wanted', 'tackle', 'just', 'touched', 'sometimes', 'can', 'work', 'really', 'schizophrenic', 'vibe', 'here', 'throw', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'get', 'pinch', 'slasher', 'films', 'handful', 'ingredients', 'thriller', 'suspense', 'movies', 'topped', 'off', 'recently', 'overused', 'twist', 'ending', 'everyone', 'come', 'expect', 'types', 'movies.The', 'pacing', 'erratic', 'helm', 'director', 'Mark', 'Tonderai', 'However', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'camerawork', 'redeem', 'capturing', 'sense', 'creepy', 'nostalgia', 'thanks', 'cinematographer', 'Miroslaw', 'Baszak', 'chose', 'use', 'type', 'film', 'look', 'grainy', 'similar', 'older', 'classic', 'horror', 'movies.Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'forth', 'best', 'effort', 'role', 'flirty', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'Elissa', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'convincing', 'enigmatic', 'Ryan', 'creepy', 'charming', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'actors', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'adequate', 'job', 'portraying', 'concerned', 'yet', 'distant', 'mother', 'sometimes', 'little', 'disconnected', 'role.The', 'high-definition', 'audio', 'video', 'transfer', 'movie', 'excellent', 'grainy', 'real', 'film', 'look', ""n't"", 'tainted', 'Blu-ray', 'treatment', '5.1', 'surround', 'mix', 'viewers', 'plenty', 'sounds', 'immerse', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'loud', 'bumps', 'noises', 'scares', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'home', 'audience', 'down', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'when', 'bonus', 'material', 'House', 'End', 'Street', 'Blu-ray', 'include', 'near-10-minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Terror', 'Inside', 'End', 'Street', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'also', 'unrated', 'theatrical', 'version', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'House', 'End', 'Street', ""n't"", 'have', 'enjoyable', 'moments', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'just', 'more', 'same', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'types', 'films', 'meal', 'walk', 'away', 'full', 'not', 'satisfied', 'Nothing', 'ate', 'was', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'one', 'PG-13', 'thriller', 'films', ""'ll"", 'see', 'being', 'played', 'repeatedly', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'year', 'so']",House at the End of the Street

1469896,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B005LAIHCW,LadyLestat,"[4, 5]","Let me just say that I saw this movie as a preview for another movie that I was watching. A movie that I can't even begin to tell you what it was, but after I saw this it peaked my interest. I wasn't really expecting too much because I got it cheap from the ""Big Red Box"" which is where I get a lot of movies now. That way, if the movies sucks, I don't own it, I'm not stuck with it, and I haven't paid that much to see it.Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I haven't seen Elisabeth Shue in a minute, and I have always liked her as an actress. At any rate, I know some of these reviews tend to over-complicate the movie, so I'm going to keep my review straight forward. Nothing was how I expected it to be, and trust me, I am rarely surprised or shocked by any of these movies nowadays. Quite frankly, it was refreshing to see something not based on a comic book character, or characters, or a movie that looks like somebody grabbed a camera with nightvision and went into their own backyard and shot a movie. With that said, I will include spoilers, so if you don't want to know what happens skip me now...First of all, it's really important that you pay attention to the flashback scenes because they explain a lot. Moving right on, the movie is about a 17-year-old girl named Alyssa (don't know if that's how they spelled it or not). Anyway, Alyssa and her mother have just moved to a new house. However, they are able to get this house really cheap because it's right next to a house where a girl supposedly murdered both parents with a hammer in the middle of the night. This girl is believed to be dead even though body was never found. Anyway, the house is suppose to be empty which was the lie the mother was told BEFORE she signed the lease only to find out afterward that the house does indeed have a current resident. She finds this out after she witnesses a light miraculously illuminate at 3:00 in the morning. The person that is living there is the eldest son of the murdered couple. Now, they say that he was suppose to be living with some Aunt he was taking care of when his sister murdered their parents, and now he's just back living in the house until he fixes it up and sells it which is what he said he was going to do.This is pretty much the basis for the movie. There are few typical parts in between like the teen angst between mother and opinionated teenage daughter. There are times when you see clearly that Alyssa and her mother don't share a great relationship. There is no father around, her mother is never home, she pretty much raises herself, and her mother seems to have a drinking problem which you can tell by the way she was polishing off the bottle of wine at dinner. The mother comes across as disconnected from her daughter, and insensitive  to Ryan because despite his niceness she doesn't trust him with her daughter.Moving further along, I will skip Alyssa and Ryan's introduction, the attempt at romance, or the relationship she was trying to start with a seemingly misunderstood, nice, respectful, guy who's just had a rough life. I don't know about anybody else, but there were many life lessons we hear about everyday in this movie: ""never get in the car with strangers,"" ""mother knows best,"" ""this is the guy your mother warned you about."" However, most teenagers at this age tend to think that they know everything about life and people in general. Those are the ones who most often wish they would have listened to their parents.Moving even further along, you eventually find out that Ryan's sister is indeed alive, and that he has kept and been looking after his seriously mentally ill ""sister"" by keeping her locked and drugged up in the house. Now, the story that Ryan initially told from the beginning involved his little sister having a horrible accident on a swing set when they were kids. Thus, the head trauma being the reason she killed their parents. There isn't anyone who has watched this movie that can tell me that they knew what the twist was going to be at the end. We find out later on through flashbacks that much of Ryan's story was true, but what didn't tell Alyssa was that their lazy father was slumped in front of the television and their drug addicted mother getting high when his sister flipped backwards off the swing and bashed her head open. Then, he and his parents buried Alyssa and kept it a secret. The question was then.. who murdered the parents? Is it safe to say he did? Maybe?I went through several endings myself while the events were unfolding, and found myself with a lot of unanswered questions, which all will be revealed in due time I tell you. I had pretty much figured out that the ""girl"", or should I say ""girls"", you thought were his sister that he was keeping down in the bowels of that house were not really his sister because if you paid attention after her caught her he broke her neck, but when Alyssa finds the room by being just a little too curious one night she finds a completely different girl. That's when this ""nice"" guy flips the script and shows his true colors. Ryan has been kidnapping girls forcing them to be his sister ""Carrie Anne."" I guess in his mind these girls were Carrie Anne, or they were going to be whether they liked it or not, and Alyssa is about to be his next ""Carrie Anne"" whether she likes it or not. Despite the fact that he actually likes her, but he ""needs"" to have another ""Carrie Anne"" more.At this point, you realize that this guy is a loon. I mean, he is just plain crazy, and we assume it's from the fact that he feels responsible for Carrie Anne's death, and his part in burying her. That's still not all of it though. The final twist, which you see in the final flashback is that his parents were responsible for all this. Apparently, after Carrie Anne's death his parents lost it, blamed him for her death, and therefore decided that he was going to take her place and be their replacement ""Carrie Ann"" whether he liked it or not. I know that was enough to mess anybody up, but for a boy being made to play his own dead little sister was hell on Earth. Ryan's parents screwed him up, and he made them pay for it with that hammer. I guess in his mind ""Carrie Anne"" did kill them and the ""Carrie Anne"" was him.Crazy, but that's what happened! This was a good movie that left my jaw on the floor.",4,Got this out of the RED BOX!,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,6362,"['Let', 'just', 'say', 'saw', 'movie', 'preview', 'movie', 'was', 'watching',

1469907,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B005LAIHCW,maskedgamer,"[4, 6]","Lets make one thing clear. The only people voting this movie 5 and 4 stars are fans of Jennifer Lawrence and Hunger Games. You won't see an in depth review but you will see Jennifer Lawrence is so great yadda yadda! On any positive review about this terrible movie. With that said how about an actual review of this film for once.This movie has been done to death. It's predictable because you've seen it before and therefore becomes not that interesting of a film to watch. The film doesn't sell the story so well because it feels like you're watching a movie. The acting is terrible and like a cheesy daytime soap opera. When the star of the movie is Jennifer Lawrence what more can you expect. Hunger games had terrible acting and so did this movie. Bringing a so so actor into a cheesy horror film doesn't make the movie better. If this film didn't star someone with a mindless fan base already This would probably be an average 3 or 2 star horror film.So why am I getting on Jennifer Lawrence's case? Well it's because a bad horror film doesn't deserve instant 5 stars because you're favorite actor is in it. I like Nicholas Cage but I'm not going to give the Wicker Man 5 stars just because he was in it (even though I did like that film a lot). I also like Milla Jovovich but I'm not going to give Resident Evil a 5/5 just because she starred in it? So what's the point of ignoring how bad a movie is and giving a hyper inflated review score because you're favorite actor is in it?Enough of my rant let me talk about the movie now...The movie is about a teenage girl and her mother who move to nice neighborhood after a divorce. Jennifer lawrence and her mother don't get a long because her mother is emotionally unstable and spent her time being a friend to her daughter instead of acting like a parent. Jennifer is introduced to the neighborhood kids and makes a few friends at school. One day after going to a party she runs in to Ryan the boy who lives in the house across the way. Ryan's parents were murdered and he moved into the house after they died or so the story is. The entire town seems to dislike Ryan and spreads rumors about him for his parents being murdered and his decided to live in their home instead of moving out and selling it (what a way to treat a victim). Ryan offers Jennifer a ride home and she soon begins to befriend and fall in love with him. The problem is that Ryan is keeping a big secret in his house (soo spooky). To which we find that his sister Carrie Ann is still alive and is locked up in his sub basement (don't worry that's not a spoiler to this film it's revealed in the first 10 minutes). That's about the only interesting part of the film. The fact that Carrie Ann is still alive after committing the murders and being looked after by her brother BUT THEN! the writers take that great plot and opportunity to create a truly unique and interesting horror story and throw it out the window. At the end of the film you feel cheated,unsatisfied and completely let down. What starts off as a potentially interesting movie turns out to be just another been there done that type of horror film.

The story begins when Elissa and her mother move to a new house in the country, a house that is across the street from the scene of a grizzly double murder four years earlier. The house and story is surrounded by rumors and still occupied by the son of the victims, who Elissa quickly befriends. Once again we have a common theme that has been done to death, but the producers of this film were hoping that by spending big bucks on Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games) and Max Thieriot (Bates Motel) that they could get people to watch their film and it worked, but I suspect most people were sadly disappointing like I was. The acting was terrific and everything you would expect from these actors, but the story was so simple and predictable that it really wasn't worth watching. Being a PG-13 film didn't help either as there wasn't really anything too horrific or creepy to really catch your attention. If that wasn't bad enough, the first hour of the film was so slow, that I almost turned it off. The only thing that kind of gave me a laugh was that there was a lot of scenes with Jennifer Lawrence in the woods and I couldn't help but think that Katniss wished she had her bow. House at The End of The Street is a film that has the star power, but not much else, as it's a slow, tame, predictable film, that's been done and it leaves far too many unanswered questions.

Granted, I am a suspense/thriller movie genre fan, but I figured that this movie would be decidedly average.  I was pleasantly surprised, then, when it hooked me right from the start and carried my interest all the way through!For a basic plot summary, ""House At The End Of The Street"" sees Elissa (Lawrence) and her mother Sarah (Elisabeth Shue) move from Chicago to a more rural local.  They quickly discover that they have a reclusive young neighbor named Ryan (Max Thieriot), who is orphaned after the grisly death of his parents.  Elissa quickly forms a relationship with Ryan and begins to unravel the secrets surrounding his life.Like I said, I was expecting to see Lawrence looking beautiful for 100 minutes and little else.  But, the film ends up working very well because it is not quite as predictable as you would think.  It will never be Shakespeare, as the saying goes, but it distinguishes itself from current similar genre fare for two significant reasons:1. The plot always keeps you guessing.  This is one of those scenarios where the less I say here the better it will be for your viewing pleasure, but suffice it to say that you won't ""figure out"" this one in the opening minutes.2. The acting is tremendous.  Lawrence shines again (when has she ever not?!), Thieriot nearly steals the show on occasion with his nuanced performance, and for older film buffs, it is fun to see Shue back on the big screen.Overall, I think that most viewers will be surprised by ""House At The End Of The Street"" for its ability to differentiate itself from the more mundane suspense/thriller fare that has cropped up recently.",4,Initially Watched For Lawrence But Quickly Got Hooked,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,1806,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'right', 'bat', 'only', 'real', 'reason', 'rented', 'film', 'was', 'had', 'recently', 'seen', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Playbook', 'fell', 'love', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Granted', 'am', 'suspense/thriller', 'movie', 'genre', 'fan', 'figured', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'decidedly', 'average', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'then', 'when', 'hooked', 'right', 'start', 'carried', 'interest', 'way', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'House', 'End', 'Street', 'Elissa', 'Lawrence', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'move', 'Chicago', 'more', 'rural', 'local', 'quickly', 'discover', 'have', 'reclusive', 'young', 'neighbor', 'named', 'Ryan', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'who', 'orphaned', 'grisly', 'death', 'parents', 'Elissa', 'quickly', 'relationship', 'Ryan', 'unravel', 'secrets', 'surrounding', 'life.Like', 'said', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'Lawrence', 'looking', 'beautiful', '100', 'minutes', 'little', 'else', 'film', 'up', 'working', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'predictable', 'would', 'think', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Shakespeare', 'saying', 'current', 'similar', 'genre', 'fare', 'two', 'significant', 'reasons:1', 'plot', 'always', 'guessing', 'one', 'scenarios', 'where', 'less', 'say', 'here', 'better', 'will', 'be', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'opening', 'minutes.2', 'acting', 'tremendous', 'Lawrence', 'shines', 'again', 'when', 'ever', 'not', 'Thieriot', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'occasion', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'older', 'film', 'buffs', 'fun', 'see', 'Shue', 'back', 'big', 'screen.Overall', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'House', 'End', 'Street', 'ability', 'differentiate', 'more', 'mundane', 'suspense/thriller', 'fare', 'cropped', 'up', 'recently']",House at the End of the Street
1469958,AB1CKA6B849SP,B005LAIHCW,zeus,"[2, 4]","Now we are talking about real family secrets with severe consequences!!!This is a very good movie with an outstanding cast and great direction. And a twist at the very end...It is a story that could happen in any street, in any neighborhood, in any country. Accidents happen every day. But when you have hippie parents who smoke dope, well that's another story.Sarah (Elisabeth Shue) and her teen daughter Elyssa (Jennifer Lawrence) arrive in a small town because Sarah just got a new job. She works long hours at the hospital and her daughter has the time and the freedom to do whatever she wants. Sarah is recently divorced and didn't take care of her daughter in the past. Elyssa reminds her of this fact constantly and appears that she misses her father. Now Sarah is overplaying her mother responsibilities which promote a lot of tension between her and Elyssa. They move next to a house where a terrific murder happened few years ago. A girl killed her parents and then disappeared. Most people think that she drowned in the near lake, but they never found her body. Her brother Ryan (Max Thieriot) came back from college to take care of the house. He lives there now quietly. Everybody in town (with few exceptions) thinks that the boy is a weirdo and ...of course a high school adolescent (Elyssa) will fall for him since everybody else is beating on him (...classic).From the beginning of the movie, the moment they get in their house we have the feeling that something horrible happens in front of us but we are not getting an answer until the very end of the movie. And then, when we think we got the plot straight, the very last scene (...seriously, the last 10 seconds) throws a wrench in everything we thought we knew. And while the titles are rolling we say: Well, I have to watch it again to understand better...Really well done, and Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue are superb.Five stars all around for the excellent acting, the script and the direction.
