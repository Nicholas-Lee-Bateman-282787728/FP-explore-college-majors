1040038,A3E1UIGSVRQXQ,B000LPS3B2,"Bobby Brady ""Radioman970""","[0, 0]","There's some very scary moments in this film.  The ending is as freaky as anything I've seen and I've been watching horror films since I was about 8 year old (43 now).  It has a nice uneasiness throughout.  I think everybody can relate to the oddities that sometimes appear in old photos (I have several myself, including one of a pet who had just died) and this film takes good advantage of that.  In fact, if you're like me you'll be looking over your shoulders often after this is over.  It does have a great deal of familiarity to it...at times it looks unpolished, but the effects are mostly quite good.With that said, I have to say I bought this last year and paid too much.  I was disappointed that it wasn't outstanding.  Instead it was good.  I paid for outstanding and didn't get that.  Still, after 2 viewings I feel like I'm over the hurtle and will enjoy it a lot more on my 3rd viewing in about a year.  Still, this doesn't come close to something like the original version of Dark Water.  It seems comfortable beside something like The Eye (original) or The Grudge (only ever seen the remake), however.  I have yet to see Ringu (just bought the anthology to watch in October, however).  Not sure if it compares to that at all.",4,Don't overpay for it and you'll be okay.

1040040,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000LPS3B2,Dave. K,"[6, 10]","Shutter would probably rate as one of the better Asian ghost flicks to come out over the last couple of years. As I stated in another review for the movie The Red Shoes this style of movie is getting too clich&eacute;d. After taking a break for a few months I have recently started watching the Asian ghost movies again.The only major downfall for Shutter is that several movies that came out after it were released in the States first so that takes away some of the impact. Had I seen Shutter during its initial release I'm sure I would have liked it more. Now that's not to say I didn't enjoy Shutter because I very much did. But like I said several movies that came out after Shutter just happened to be released here first.Despite the clich&eacute;s Shutter, proves Asian filmmakers are still capable of making a movie like this and can make it enjoyable. Unlike some other ghost movies it takes a while before the haunting begins. Normally a few things will start to happen and it's a foreshadowing of things to come.But in Shutter it starts to happen rather early and stays through the movie, which is what helped keep the movie moving along. Let's be honest here though the long haired Asian girl doesn't exactly strike the fear it once did from the viewer. We have seen it done so many times by now it has lost its impact a bit.But directors Banjong Pisanthanakun & Parkpoom Wongpoom are still able to make the best of the scenes and they are able to make several scenes a lot creepier than they really should be. While I can't say I was scared, but there were several very suspenseful and tense moments, which for the majority have been lacking in recent movies like this.Of all the Asian ghost flicks I have seen as of recent none were badly made they just suffered from too many clich&eacute;s, but this movie is able to make the best of them. The mystery angle was rather solid, but at the same time I felt more time was needed and would have made the movie even stronger. While the script wasn't bad, Shutter can sometimes be a bit slow when there is no ghostly haunting.The characters were ok; while they weren't boring they weren't strong enough to carry the movie when there was no ghost. But with that said there is a very interesting twist with the character Tun. He's not as innocent as most characters are in these movies and that was an excellent change of pace. Like I said there are flaws; again we have seen this style of movie played out, while the characters were good they just weren't interesting enough to carry the movie for too long.Besides being clich&eacute;d the only problem I have with Shutter is that some of the scenes just fall a bit flat. To me it just seemed the characters were often repeating themselves in scenes just with different words. That's not to say Shutter wasn't well-written; it does have a solid script for the most part.But there are also several things about Shutter that are excellent. The scene when the ghost is on the side of the car was a creepy scene and provided a great jolt and when the ghost chases Tun around late in the movie was one of the creepiest scenes I have seen in an Asian ghost flick in quite sometime. For those new to this style of movie I would say Shutter should be one of the first films you see so it doesn't lose the impact the scenes have. For those who are well schooled on these movies, Shutter won't offer you anything you haven't seen before.But with that said it's by far one of the better Asian ghost movies and despite the clich&eacute; it can and probably will keep you entertained. As I stated earlier in the review several movies that were made after Shutter just happened to be released in here in the States first, which is a shame because it does hurt the movie a little bit.In closing despite the clich&eacute;s and some flaws, Shutter was an excellent movie and shows there is still some life left in this sub-genre.",4,Despite the cliches Shutter works well.,1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,3919,"['Shutter', 'would', 'probably', 'rate', 'one', 'better', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'flicks', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'stated', 'review', 'movie', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'style', 'movie', 'getting', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd.', 'taking', 'break', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'recently', 'started', 'watching', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'movies', 'again.The', 'only', 'major', 'downfall', 'Shutter', 'several', 'movies', 'came', 'out', 'were', 'released', 'States', 'first', 'so', 'away', 'impact', 'Had', 'seen', 'Shutter', 'initial', 'release', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'Now', 'not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Shutter', 'very', 'much', 'did', 'said', 'several', 'movies', 'came', 'out', 'Shutter', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'released', 'here', 'first.Despite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Shutter', 'Asian', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'still', 'capable', 'making', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'ghost', 'movies', 'while', 'haunting', 'Normally', 'few', 'things', 'will', 'start', 'happen', 'foreshadowing', 'things', 'come.But', 'Shutter', 'happen', 'rather', 'early', 'movie', 'what', 'helped', 'keep', 'movie', 'moving', 'along', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'long', 'haired', 'Asian', 'girl', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'strike', 'fear', 'once', 'did', 'viewer', 'have', 'seen', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'now', 'lost', 'impact', 'bit.But', 'directors', 'Banjong', 'Pisanthanakun', 'Parkpoom', 'Wongpoom', 'are', 'still', 'able', 'make', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'able', 'make', 'several', 'scenes', 'lot', 'creepier', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'scared', 'were', 'several', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'tense', 'moments', 'majority', 'have', 'been', 'lacking', 'recent', 'movies', 'this.Of', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'flicks', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'none', 'were', 'badly', 'made', 'just', 'suffered', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'movie', 'able', 'make', 'best', 'mystery', 'angle', 'was', 'rather', 'solid', 'same', 'time', 'felt', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'needed', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'stronger', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Shutter', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'bit', 'slow', 'when', 'ghostly', 'characters', 'were', 'ok', 'were', ""n't"", 'boring', 'were', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'ghost', 'said', 'very', 'interesting', 'twist', 'character', 'Tun', 'not', 'as', 'innocent', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'movies', 'was', 'excellent', 'change', 'pace', 'said', 'are', 'flaws', 'again', 'have', 'seen', 'style', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'characters', 'were', 'good', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'enough', 'carry', 'movie', 'too', 'long.Besides', 'being', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'Shutter', 'scenes', 'just', 'fall', 'bit', 'flat', 'just', 'seemed', 'characters', 'were', 'often', 'repeating', 'scenes', 'just', 'different', 'words', 'not', 'say', 'Shutter', 'was', ""n't"", 'well-written', 'have', 'solid', 'script', 'most', 'part.But', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'things', 'Shutter', 'are', 'excellent', 'scene', 'when', 'ghost', 'side', 'car', 'was', 'creepy', 'scene', 'provided', 'great', 'jolt', 'when', 'ghost', 'Tun', 'late', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'creepiest', 'scenes', 'have', 'seen', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'flick', 'quite', 'sometime', 'new', 'style', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'Shutter', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'see', 'so', ""n't"", 'lose', 'impact', 'scenes', 'have', 'who', 'are', 'well', 'schooled', 'movies', 'Shutter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before.But', 'said', 'far', 'one', 'better', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'movies', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'probably', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'stated', 'earlier', 'review', 'several', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'Shutter', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'released', 'here', 'States', 'first', 'shame', 'hurt', 'movie', 'little', 'bit.In', 'closing', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'flaws', 'Shutter', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'shows', 'still', 'life', 'left', 'sub-genre']",Shutter The Original

They (Tun) decides to just leave the victim lying in the street (it being an accident and all).  So they drive off like nothing has happened.It never works out that way though does it?  The girl that they hit and left for dead has a special connection to Tun that gets explained in vivid detail later on in the movie..suffice to say its very interesting.  Also pay attention when he starts complaining about ""his neck hurting"" and watch for it later on.  Its an excellent movie and i have bought movies from Tartan Asia Extreme in the past ""Two Sisters"" which was also pretty good.

After they later leave it, they can get caught in between certain worlds. And by their vast attachments ranging from a myriad of reasons. They can try to hold onto a person who is still living on the earthly human plane of life.Due to hollywood truly not understanding the other realms of being.They unfortunately pervert certain ""true-isms"" in which leaves the viewer stuck within the interpretation that the movie was/is meant to be just another haunted scary movie genre.This movie was really put together pretty good! It contains alot of realistic proportions/fragments within it.I only give movies like this their props only when deserving. And this one is well worth it!When one has/does go through the appropriate training towards having mystical experiences,From years of meditation,Purging/Purification practices of various kind,Mysticism,Obe's,Getting into states of being,Traveling of various types,unfolding into the self,etc;Then such a person/people can both relate and better grasp these sort of movies. And gain a much deeper appreciation towards certain realities in which particular kind of movies like this possess.Their is no need for one to go into the sorting out of the movie.Because after an individual grows into their own aspects of being.Such a person/people then learn how to decipher/cipher/jigsaw puzzle the movie together as a whole on their own.The more that a person/people grow towards the inner/innate depths of their own being. The more an individual learns the importance of working out their own weaknesses/gaining more balance while living their life on the earth plane.In the long run we are all responsible for our own actions. And one of the necessities for all of us is to evolve into being ""selfless"" as opposed to leaving the earth in a ""selfish"" state of being.This great truth in which is being spoken is very,very,very,important to live up to!One could break the movie down to the smallest molecule and cell.And the truth spoken would still stay veiled within infinity.Because we all learn these hidden truths to life by our willingness to want to take responsibility for our choices/actions in which we do/make.I recommend this to anyone who wants to grow.A person/people must not so much look at the ""selfishness"" from a one-sided perspective. Because not only was the woman who was deceased selfish by her attachments. But the man who was still living on the earth plane, was selfish also,by his actions of withholding information. Along with his choice of trying to carry on throughout life living a constant lie by pretending to be innocent in the matter.The importance of becoming ""selfless"" is a divine quality in which we all need to develop. Because our actions are not just counted for in the here and now.But what we do calculates into other extensions of our being and lives to still yet come.Of course everyone always takes from a movie what they choose to take from it. And thats fine too! However,if a person/people want to grow away from their selfish ways,they must first purge themselves from their own vast web of selfish afflictions.Such appropriate actions of purging opens the doors of ones compassion towards others. Its by sincerily adapting to being compassionate in which eventually dissolves a persons selfishness.Let one who in which has an open mind grasp this great truth.By allowing themself to shine within the infinite radiance by being both ""selfless"" and ""compassionate"".So Mote It Be!",5,In Between Worlds Phenomenology,1236297600,"03 6, 2009",2009,3685,"['Movie', 'Shutter', 'really', 'not', 'being', 'scary', 'movie.The', 'Movie', 'Shutter', 'about', 'true', 'other', 'worldly', 'phenomena', 'sometimes', 'take', 'place', 'certain', 'people', 'who', 'once', 'lived', 'earthly', 'plane', 'later', 'leave', 'can', 'get', 'caught', 'certain', 'worlds', 'vast', 'attachments', 'ranging', 'myriad', 'reasons', 'can', 'try', 'hold', 'person', 'who', 'still', 'living', 'earthly', 'human', 'plane', 'life.Due', 'hollywood', 'truly', 'not', 'understanding', 'other', 'realms', 'being.They', 'unfortunately', 'pervert', 'certain', 'true-isms', 'viewer', 'stuck', 'interpretation', 'movie', 'was/is', 'meant', 'be', 'just', 'haunted', 'scary', 'movie', 'genre.This', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'put', 'together', 'pretty', 'good', 'alot', 'realistic', 'proportions/fragments', 'it.I', 'only', 'give', 'movies', 'props', 'only', 'when', 'deserving', 'one', 'well', 'worth', 'When', 'one', 'has/does', 'go', 'appropriate', 'training', 'towards', 'having', 'mystical', 'experiences', 'years', 'meditation', 'Purging/Purification', 'practices', 'various', 'kind', 'Mysticism', 'Obe', 'Getting', 'states', 'being', 'Traveling', 'various', 'types', 'unfolding', 'self', 'etc', 'Then', 'person/people', 'can', 'both', 'relate', 'better', 'grasp', 'sort', 'movies', 'gain', 'much', 'deeper', 'appreciation', 'towards', 'certain', 'realities', 'particular', 'kind', 'movies', 'possess.Their', 'need', 'one', 'go', 'sorting', 'movie.Because', 'individual', 'grows', 'own', 'aspects', 'person/people', 'then', 'learn', 'how', 'decipher/cipher/jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'movie', 'together', 'whole', 'own.The', 'more', 'person/people', 'grow', 'inner/innate', 'depths', 'own', 'being', 'more', 'individual', 'importance', 'working', 'out', 'own', 'weaknesses/gaining', 'more', 'balance', 'living', 'life', 'earth', 'plane.In', 'long', 'run', 'are', 'responsible', 'own', 'actions', 'one', 'necessities', 'evolve', 'being', 'selfless', 'opposed', 'leaving', 'earth', 'selfish', 'state', 'being.This', 'great', 'truth', 'being', 'spoken', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'important', 'live', 'up', 'One', 'could', 'break', 'movie', 'down', 'smallest', 'molecule', 'cell.And', 'truth', 'spoken', 'would', 'still', 'stay', 'infinity.Because', 'learn', 'hidden', 'truths', 'life', 'willingness', 'want', 'take', 'responsibility', 'choices/actions', 'do/make.I', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'grow.A', 'person/people', 'must', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'look', 'selfishness', 'one-sided', 'perspective', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'deceased', 'selfish', 'attachments', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'earth', 'plane', 'was', 'selfish', 'also', 'actions', 'withholding', 'information', 'choice', 'trying', 'carry', 'life', 'living', 'constant', 'lie', 'pretending', 'be', 'innocent', 'matter.The', 'importance', 'becoming', 'selfless', 'divine', 'quality', 'need', 'develop', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'counted', 'here', 'now.But', 'what', 'do', 'calculates', 'other', 'extensions', 'being', 'lives', 'still', 'yet', 'come.Of', 'course', 'everyone', 'always', 'movie', 'what', 'choose', 'take', 'thats', 'fine', 'too', 'However', 'person/people', 'want', 'grow', 'away', 'selfish', 'ways', 'must', 'first', 'purge', 'own', 'vast', 'web', 'selfish', 'afflictions.Such', 'appropriate', 'actions', 'purging', 'doors', 'ones', 'compassion', 'others', 'sincerily', 'adapting', 'being', 'compassionate', 'eventually', 'persons', 'selfishness.Let', 'one', 'who', 'open', 'mind', 'grasp', 'great', 'truth.By', 'allowing', 'shine', 'infinite', 'radiance', 'being', 'selfless', 'compassionate', '.So', 'Mote', 'Be']",Shutter The Original

Why she waited so long is never questioned so don't expect an answer.  This angry specter just suddenly pops up, mostly in poor photography, but sometimes in the flesh (so to speak), and begins to wreck havoc on those responsible for her sorry state.  As revenge killings go, this one was pretty lax; most of the deaths were simply mentioned as hearsay, late in the game.  For a spirit bent on reprisal, this one was pretty lazy going about it.  Things don't start getting anxious until the last third of the movie.

1040047,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000LPS3B2,Ernest Jagger,"[26, 30]","""Shutter,"" offers nothing new in the horror genre, in regards to what one expects from horror. However, what impressed me with the film is that it is the first feature film by both of the Thai directors, Bangjong Pisanthankun and Parkpoom Wongpoom. And given that Thailand does not have a very large, or great pedigree in the horror film market in comparison to Japan, this film is a worthy effort. The films main protagonist is named Tun (Ananda Everingham), and he portrays a photographer whose past is about to catch up to him. Tun and his girlfriend Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) are driving home late one night after drinking and entertaining friends at a club, when suddenly their  car hits someone in the dark. Since both were drinking, Tun decides it best to leave the scene of the accident.Nothing will be the same for the two after this incident. Moreover, there is something in Tun's past [no spoilers] which will have a significant impact on his life. Soon strange occurances begin to happen. The photographs that Tun snaps appear to show strange shapes and figures in them. Thinking that these exposures were defective, or the careless acts of the developer, Tun insists that a mistake has been made. It is either his camera, or defective film. Soon Tun's friends begin to die suddenly: All by by suicide; and each of them have a connection to Tun and his past. Thinking that the car accident was the reason for the now unexplained events that are occuring in his life, Tun and Jane begin to look into this matter. However, the true reason behind these events are much more ominous  and sinister.While the film does have some elements of other horror films in the film, they are more out of an influence than genuine copying. Furthermore, this is typical of the horror genre, including American horror films. Many borrow from each other. Having written this, I would also like to point out that there are many elements in this film which you will not see in MANY horror films: Like a story. The strength of this film is the journey that Tun and Jane must go through in trying to untangle the mess that their life has now suddenly taken. Further, the acting is very good in this film. Plus there are no special effects, or silly gore scenes. All in all, I thought this was a very good film, and for that it gets 5 stars. I have the import DVD, purchased through Asia Cinema. Therefore, I don't know how well this current DVD copy is. However, I do recommend the film. It will make a nice addition to your foreign cinema collection.

You know how someone says, ""You want to hear a hilarious joke?"" Then when you hear the joke it's not as funny as if they just would have told you the joke first.Anticipation ruins jokes just as it does horror films. I heard from numerous people this was one of the scariest films out of Asia and sadly I have to beg to differ. Although in all fairness, I guess by default, I would have to say it's the scariest out of Thailand (as no others come to mind). I'm just getting tired of seeing the same creepy-crawly Ringu girl in every film as of late.All ranting aside, I wont bother to create another plot synopsis as many other reviewers have already done that part. I'll be brief as I don't want the viewer to anticipate any scenes.Downsides-Poor picture quality (reminiscent of a bad soap opera episode).Not enough effective lighting (personally I like my horror films to have that generally dark feel to them).Much like this one, too many films are capitalizing off of the creepy Ringu-girl.Fairly predictable but definitely not 100% predictable.Upsides-Decent plot (with exception to the *main ""picture""* scene, that didn't make sense to me).Some genuinely good creep-outs.I really liked the general idea of the movie.The closing scene was very good.Overall, ""Shutter"" was a decent movie. I never got bored or felt that the film was dragging on. It may have been better had I not expected so much. It's not that ""Shutter"" was a bad film, it just wasn't fantastic.

While it borrows a bit from the Ringu cycle, the film makers have added enough originality to make the film stand on its own. It is all done with a great deal of talent and packs quite a horrific blow! I had the pleasure of viewing this film the other night and was surprised by all of the clever editing tricks employed by the filmmakers. Some of this editing is so sneaky it happens before your eyes can catch it!After a night out drinking with his fellow graduate friends, photography student Tun (Ananda Everingham) and his girlfriend Jane (Nattaweeranuch Thongmee) accidentally run down a girl who's standing in the middle of the road. After panicking and leaving without stopping to help, Jane begins to have nightmares and Tun finds ghost-like images in the backgrounds of his photos. When his friends start apparently committing suicide, Tun and Jane's investigations lead to more possible incidents of guilt concerning another student, Natre (Achita Sikamana). They may only be in their mid-twenties and this their debut film, but ""Shutter's"" Thai co-directors Parkpoom Wongpoom and Banjong Pisanthanakun have a fantastic feel for what makes an atmospheric, tension filled ghost story.One of the remarkable things about this movie is the cast especially Everingham. Besides being easy on the eyes he has shown several different sides to his character as the story moves in unexpected directions. As beautiful as Jane is, she has the most straightforward and possibly the only completely sympathetic character but she does really well to make Jane far more interesting than the usual screaming girlfriend. Sikamana is good as the quiet reclusive student and then downright terrifying as the vengeful ghost. Even though the ghost is still a woman with messy hair, at least she doesn't stand at the end of halls trying to trick you into thinking she is scary. She actually moves and does things, a winning combo in ghost movies... and the bedroom. The scary moments are so effective. The ""pick a boo"" scene are really scary cause it actually made me jump and I don't do that. Another thing that ""Shutter"" has going for it is director Banjong Pisanthanakun cause he got skills compare to the other directors in this territory.

In my opinion, it's the scariest film that I've seen since the American remake of ""The Grudge,"" which gets my vote for scariest movie ever made.  While for the most part an original piece of work, ""Shutter"" does seem to take elements from past horror films: ""Ghost Story,"" ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" and ""The Grudge,"" to name a few.  But overall, the plot was surprisingly good, with an interesting explanation at the end of the film that I thought amazing!  Asian horror movies seem capable of creating a suspenseful and truly frightening story, unlike most of the cookie cutter movies of Hollywood (I can't even remember the last domestic horror film that was 1) not a remake and 2) was actually scary.)Without giving away any of the main details, the plot revolves around restless spirits - one in particular.  The story has revenge as its main theme.  The special effects are absolutely brilliant - as in the Japanese version of ""The Ring"" and the American remake of ""The Grudge"" - two other great horror horror films.  The film's title comes from the use of cameras by some of the main characters, which capture some images of one of the spirits.There are some slow parts at times, but it is fill with enough scares to keep you on the edge of your seat.

(If I had to say anything about it, I'd say it's a story of obsessive love from beyond the grave). The ghost lady seemed to have been borrowed from Ju-On, (The Grudge) at times, though admittedly not as effective as that one, but the whole movie was very interesting and absorbing to follow and very well done indeed. I didn't get bored at all and loved every minute of it. No annoying laughs and attempts at humour, just a very dark story, and creepy atmosphere. There was a song featured in it, when the couple were driving along in their car, heard then only briefly, and then the whole song played out over the end credits, and featured on the dvd for the photo gallery section, and I wanted to listen to it over and over again. It did say in the credits what the song was called and who by, but as I didn't write it down and it was in a language I'm not familiar with, I can't say what it was called or who by, but it was credited with the date 1965 so maybe was a wellknown release round about that time in that part of the world. Whatever, it was a lovely song and I'd love to get a recording of it if it's available. It seemed really creepy in relation to the movie, and it was so nice to hear a theme song that shows the makers of the movie seem to have used some imagination in deciding what to use, whereas so often the music used in a movie is a bit of a disappointment.

1040063,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000LPS3B2,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[1, 1]","There's a kind of mental checklist I write up whenever I sit down to watch an Asian horror movie. One, girl ghost with long hair over her face. Two, water. Three, revenge. Four, empathy with the villain. Five, a twist.I actually got ""Shutter"" in the same delivery as ""The Ghost"", and while both movies certainly have all of the above criteria in common, and both are ultimately formulaic and on-rails, ""Shutter"" is hands-down the superior film, for a number of reasons.It's also an excellent movie without any comparisons to go on. The first and most notable quality which ""Shutter"" has is a decided sense of contrast. There's a definite sense of low-budget amateurism in the production values, and this is offset by sleek, tense direction and a very compelling central performance by Ananda Everingham. The result is a horror film that feels more real and honest than its contemporaries, and, given that we're walking on some very familiar ground with the subject matter, this realism is a very important asset.The special effects are kept to a bare minimum - directors Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom show great courage, in this age of OTT effects-laden dreck, by actually using their skill behind a camera to create the fear for us. There's a lot of good old-fashioned JUMP!! moments on offer, but ""Shutter"" keeps the tension going in-between these parts, by never letting the action drag or the tension disappear. Which is a brave gamble - the constant sense of dread could have become very old, very fast - but somehow ""Shutter"" engages us from the first frames and keeps us engaged until the credits roll.The use of sound - ambient sound, screams, offscreen effects - is very clever, and very effective - a lot more so than in many horror films. Suphot Raksa's sense of aural storytelling is an ideal compliment to the director's visual sense, and the sparse, straightforward dialogue provides a utilitarian method of delivering a fairly straightforward plot.Besides Everingham giving an excellent performance as the hero Tun, there's a general high standard of acting on offer - even the more minor roles like Tun's girlfriend Jane, or his best pal Tonn, are well-crafted characters. Besides Everingham, nobody stands out, but then, nobody's got as much screen time as him, either.I will not write any plot spoilers, but be assured - if, like me, your Asian horror fix has been neglected of late (frankly I stopped watching because they all got a little... ...samey), ""Shutter"" is absolutely worth your time. While it is very similar to a lot of entries in this particular genre of horror, and is, at its heart, unoriginal, it's also an elegant, well-made and genuinely frightening film. On the other hand, if ""Saw"" and ""Scream"" are more your style, stay away from this one. ""Shutter"" is an acquired taste, but for those of us who like this sort of thing, it's definitely superior.Recommended.",4,"Superior genre entry, genuinely scary movie",1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,2912,"['kind', 'mental', 'checklist', 'write', 'up', 'whenever', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movie', 'One', 'ghost', 'long', 'hair', 'face', 'Two', 'water', 'Three', 'revenge', 'Four', 'empathy', 'villain', 'Five', 'twist.I', 'actually', 'got', 'Shutter', 'same', 'delivery', 'Ghost', 'movies', 'certainly', 'have', 'above', 'criteria', 'common', 'are', 'ultimately', 'formulaic', 'on-rails', 'Shutter', 'hands-down', 'superior', 'film', 'number', 'reasons.It', 'also', 'excellent', 'movie', 'comparisons', 'go', 'first', 'most', 'notable', 'quality', 'Shutter', 'decided', 'sense', 'contrast', 'definite', 'sense', 'low-budget', 'amateurism', 'production', 'values', 'offset', 'sleek', 'tense', 'direction', 'very', 'compelling', 'central', 'performance', 'Ananda', 'Everingham', 'result', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'real', 'honest', 'contemporaries', 'given', ""'re"", 'walking', 'very', 'familiar', 'ground', 'subject', 'matter', 'realism', 'very', 'important', 'asset.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'kept', 'bare', 'minimum', 'directors', 'Banjong', 'Pisanthanakun', 'Parkpoom', 'Wongpoom', 'show', 'great', 'courage', 'age', 'OTT', 'effects-laden', 'dreck', 'actually', 'using', 'skill', 'camera', 'create', 'fear', 'lot', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'JUMP', 'moments', 'offer', 'Shutter', 'tension', 'going', 'in-between', 'parts', 'never', 'letting', 'action', 'drag', 'tension', 'disappear', 'Which', 'brave', 'gamble', 'constant', 'sense', 'dread', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'very', 'old', 'very', 'fast', 'somehow', 'Shutter', 'first', 'frames', 'engaged', 'credits', 'roll.The', 'use', 'sound', 'ambient', 'sound', 'screams', 'offscreen', 'effects', 'very', 'clever', 'very', 'effective', 'lot', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'Suphot', 'Raksa', 'sense', 'aural', 'storytelling', 'ideal', 'compliment', 'director', 'visual', 'sense', 'sparse', 'straightforward', 'dialogue', 'utilitarian', 'method', 'delivering', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'plot.Besides', 'Everingham', 'giving', 'excellent', 'performance', 'hero', 'Tun', 'general', 'high', 'standard', 'acting', 'offer', 'even', 'more', 'minor', 'roles', 'Tun', 'girlfriend', 'Jane', 'best', 'pal', 'Tonn', 'are', 'well-crafted', 'characters', 'Everingham', 'nobody', 'out', 'then', 'nobody', 'got', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'either.I', 'will', 'not', 'write', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'be', 'assured', 'Asian', 'horror', 'fix', 'been', 'neglected', 'late', 'frankly', 'stopped', 'watching', 'got', 'little', 'samey', 'Shutter', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'time', 'very', 'similar', 'lot', 'entries', 'particular', 'genre', 'horror', 'heart', 'unoriginal', 'also', 'elegant', 'well-made', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'Saw', 'Scream', 'are', 'more', 'style', 'stay', 'away', 'one', 'Shutter', 'acquired', 'taste', 'who', 'sort', 'thing', 'definitely', 'superior.Recommended']",Shutter The Original

(I should have known better; aren't most American horror films remakes these days?) I haven't seen the American version yet-- it's in the queue-- but I liked the original a great deal.Tun (The Leap Years' Ananda Everingham) is a graduation photographer. Along with his girlfriend, Jane (Noodle Boxer's Natthaweeranuch Thongmee), he goes to a party where he's reunited with three old friends for the first time since his school days in the opening scene of the film. On the way home from the party, Tun and Jane are involved in a car accident, and things get weird from there. Tun becomes convinced that his old girlfriend Natre (Ghost Station's Achita Sikamana) is haunting him, and he and Jane try and figure out why.While it's not the world's most original movie-- few Asian ghost flicks are, these days-- it gets a whole lot of points for style (as do most Asian ghost flicks these days). While the film certainly has enough moments that will have you jumping in your chair, it's the pervasive sense of creepiness that really makes this movie work. Now, again, that's nothing new if you've been following Asian horror films for the past decade (and hasn't everyone?), but I'm still an easy mark, especially given that, as I said above, pretty much every American horror flick these days coming out of the big studios is a remake of either a recent Asian horror film or an older American horror film, and all of them are highly dumbed-down. So even mediocre films from Thailand, China, Japan, and other countries in that area are bound to score points with me, simply because the standard is so much higher there. People still care about being scared by the atmosphere of a film. They still care about the relationships between the characters. They still understand that it's possible to make an effective chiller without buckets of fake blood. (In fact, the last decade of Asian horror films have, for the most part, eschewed the buckets of fake blood as a reaction to the Japanese Extreme Horror movement; most of the truly great Asian horror films from the past decade have been almost bloodless, as opposed to earlier gorefests like the Guinea Pig films or Bio-Zombie.) And as long as they keep doing it so well, I'll keep being happy with their output.

1040065,A2D1F0HWHN4T1U,B000LPS3B2,Robert,"[0, 0]","I've watched a number of Asian horror films, and at times have found them to be unsettling, but sometimes lacking a coherent story to give the scenes context. ""Shutter"" puts to rest any such notion. Despite being created by a couple of twenty somethings, this is mature filmmaking at its finest. It's tension comes not from special effects or gore, but from a truly fascinating (if not original) plot involving engaging characters, mysterious photos, a vengeful spirit, and the impact of past decisions on the present day.Tun and Jane are the primary characters, who accidentally hit a pedestrian on the way home from a dinner party, then leave the scene without offering any assistance. Their lives, and those of their friends, are soon in disarray as disturbing images appear in photos taken in and around their college campus. Soon, friends begin dying as a result of apparent suicides, and we learn of a sordid incident in the past that Tun had dared not reveal to Jane. We are also introduced to the idea of spirits appearing in photographs (apparently with real photos that are acknowledged in the credits), giving credence to the idea that Tun and Jane are being haunted by the ghost of the woman that appears in the pictures. The search for an explanation and a solution is suspense at its finest, as the tension built between the characters and by the storyline is masterful and palpable.The fright factor is also significant, as the ghostly appearances are often surprising and not without some element of shock. The use of lighting and shadows is well done, and the acting (granted, it is subtitled) more than capably enhances the sense of urgency and fear. The use of the female apparition, now an Asian genre staple, is more effective here than I've ever seen, as her presence leaves an indelible impression on the viewer.This is one movie you'll think about even after the credits roll, as the ending is one you'll not find in American films. It's not uplifting or heartfelt, but it is a satisfying conclusion that unifies all the themes present in the film.

While the formula of ""protagonist is terrorized by the insatible ghost of a creepy looking, long-haired asian woman"" seems to have been repeated ad nauseum in the last couple of years, ""Shutter"" provides a more coherent plot than some other recent supernatural movies and delievers an ending that is neither painfully obvious halfway through the film nor so obtuse that you'll have to check a FAQ to figure out what exactly it's getting at.""Shutter"" provides a creepy atmosphere throughout and pulls of its big scares quite effectively.  Furthermore, the scares are legitimately scary, presenting the viewer with genuinely unnerving moments rather than wallowing in gore.  At one point the director has opted to show a collage of real (such as they are) ghost photos as the protagonist searches for an explanation for the mysterious apparitions that have begun appearing in his own pictures.  This is a very minor detail, but somehow a quite satisfying one.I'll admit that it's difficult for me to render a verdict on the acting because it's in Thai, but the characters are interesting and there aren't any performances that detract from the story.  Indeed I have very few gripes with the film. Of the Thai horror films that I've seen, ""Shutter"" is easily at the top of the (somewhat small) heap.  All things being equal, I would say this movie is at least on par with the current benchmark of imported asian horror, ""Ringu"".The only thing that really hurts the movie at all is that some parts will seem like stuff you've seen before if you've seen very many asian horror movies.  (Or if you've seen ""The Grudge 2"", in which case you'll have seen a scene pretty much taken straight out of ""Shutter"".)

So far, from Thai horror, I have not gone wrong at all, as this movie was great as was Art of the Devil as well.The movie is shot very well, and the acting is not bad at all.  Secondly the storyline is great and is devoid of plotholes.  Once the flashbacks and the backstory start, you are in for a real treat, as that is when the real creepyness begins.  I am not going to give away the ending, but I must say the ending is absolutely AWESOME, and leaves you with your jaw dropped, secondly the 1st half is a great build-up to a turbulent, action packed, exciting second half, that you will certainly not forget.The movie definately takes aspects of the Ringu, Ju-On and the Excorcist and masterfully melds them into one great horror movie.  While the movie is not overly original in its scares or portrayal of creepy long-haired women, the movie does add a great Thai flavor in its incorporation of Buddhism.The basic jist of the movie follows Tun (a professional photographer) and his girlfriend Jane.  Tun starts seeing ghostly images in his photography.  Throughout the movie the hauntings by the ghost turn out to get more and more intense, culminating in a final physical showdown and one hell of a great ending with a nasty twist!  Jane in the mean time, does some investigation into the haunting and learns some pretty dark things about her boyfriend's past that certainly explain why an angry spectre is out to get him.Definately get this movie and keep it for you collection as it is a keeper! The movie is creepy and exciting and keeps you wanting to know what is coming next.  Not to mention they gave the perfect creepy, karmatic conclusion to this movie.  I definately recommend this you will not be disappointed at all.Please see this one before seeing the American remake.  The American remake of this movie with its huge budget and high tech camera equipment is an ABSOLUTE DISASTER!",5,Review - Shutter,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,2150,"['movie', 'great', 'entry', 'Thai', 'horror', 'market', 'definately', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'seeing', 'movie', 'atmospheric', 'creepy', 'definately', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie', 'phenominal', 'condsidering', 'how', 'small', 'Thai', 'horror', 'market', 'So', 'far', 'Thai', 'horror', 'have', 'not', 'gone', 'wrong', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'Art', 'Devil', 'well.The', 'movie', 'shot', 'very', 'well', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'Secondly', 'storyline', 'great', 'devoid', 'plotholes', 'flashbacks', 'backstory', 'start', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'when', 'real', 'creepyness', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'must', 'say', 'ending', 'absolutely', 'AWESOME', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'secondly', '1st', 'half', 'great', 'build-up', 'turbulent', 'action', 'packed', 'exciting', 'second', 'half', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'forget.The', 'movie', 'definately', 'aspects', 'Ringu', 'Ju-On', 'Excorcist', 'masterfully', 'melds', 'one', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'overly', 'original', 'scares', 'portrayal', 'creepy', 'long-haired', 'women', 'movie', 'add', 'great', 'Thai', 'flavor', 'incorporation', 'Buddhism.The', 'basic', 'jist', 'movie', 'Tun', 'professional', 'photographer', 'girlfriend', 'Jane', 'Tun', 'seeing', 'ghostly', 'images', 'photography', 'movie', 'hauntings', 'ghost', 'turn', 'out', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'intense', 'culminating', 'final', 'physical', 'showdown', 'one', 'hell', 'great', 'ending', 'nasty', 'twist', 'Jane', 'mean', 'time', 'investigation', 'haunting', 'pretty', 'dark', 'things', 'boyfriend', 'past', 'certainly', 'explain', 'why', 'angry', 'spectre', 'out', 'get', 'him.Definately', 'get', 'movie', 'keep', 'collection', 'keeper', 'movie', 'creepy', 'exciting', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'Not', 'mention', 'gave', 'perfect', 'creepy', 'karmatic', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'definately', 'recommend', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'all.Please', 'see', 'one', 'seeing', 'American', 'remake', 'American', 'remake', 'movie', 'huge', 'budget', 'high', 'tech', 'camera', 'equipment', 'ABSOLUTE', 'DISASTER']",Shutter The Original

Soon the Koreans followed with their films and now here is a contribution from Thailand. And like many of its predecessors ""Shutter"" is currently being remade in English.The first thing that is really striking is the neat production. This is my first Thai film and I was surprised at the total package. The screenplay is good and though there is some blood it cannot be classified under ""slasher"" horror. Creepy scenes there are a plenty and the film is really good at it. The movie will grab your attention right from the beginning and have you hooked till the end. The story of revenge is nothing new but with a nice twist.Two beautiful things that the movie excels at are its lovely theme tune and the beautiful little romance that goes awry. And here's a tip. At the close of the film pay special attention. I knew there was something queer but didn't care to check it out. If not for a friend's advice I would have never taken a second look.

1040069,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000LPS3B2,Tim Janson,"[13, 14]","Shutter was my first experience with a horror film made in Thailand and I was taken by its subtle terror and the skillful way that the suspense was built up over the course of the film. Shutter is the work of two young Thai directors, Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom, who, despite their inexperience, have crafted a mesmerizing film of horror, guilt, and sorrow.Tun, and his girlfriend Jane are heading home after a night of drinking with Tun's buddies when they hit a young woman walking in the road. Jane wants to get out to check on her but Tun urges her to drive away. In the days following the accident, Jane is wracked with guilt, wondering what happened to the woman while Tun's only worry is the neck pain he's experiencing from the accident. Tun is a photographer and he starts to notice strange images appearing in his pictures. Wisps of glare distort the images and what appears to be a shadowy figure is seen.Jane finally convinces Tun to re-visit the accident site but no trace of the girl is found and no hospitals report any accident victims from that night. They visit the publisher of a ghost magazine and he shows them dozens of photos with spiritual images in them...some fakes, yet others unexplained. The tensions mount as Jane learns about Tun's connection to the girl they hit on the road, a shy, former lover who he dated in college. The film builds masterfully towards an unsettling and utterly terrifying climax, the likes of which I've not experienced before. This is a ghost story in the true gothic tradition. A mournful, baleful spirit who elicits both fear and pity.At first I thought Shutter was just going to be another Ju-On type of film and it's almost as if the directors caught themselves falling into that inevitable comparison, and took things in another direction. It's a small film...the main characters (one or both) are onscreen nearly throughout the entire movie. Natthaweeranuch Thongmee as Jane and Ananda Everingham as Tun are wonderful and believable in their roles. Unlike so many low-budget American horror films where the actors play brainless characters, these two show amazing depth and have a genuine chemistry together. Again, considering their relative inexperience as actors, their performances are surprisingly real.What really propels Shutter is that it doesn't go for any cheap thrills or scares the way so many American films do...there's no gratuitous T &A;, no obnoxious machismo from the male actors, just restrained, and powerful performances. These two young stars, and their directors have a great future in front of them.If there was one slight disappointment, it's that the DVD doesn't come with much in the way of extras. There's a brief interview segment with directors and cast, and some behind the scenes material but that's about it. The film is in Thai with English subtitles.

1040070,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000LPS3B2,Tsuyoshi,"[14, 17]","Spooky Thai horror film ""Shutter"" (2004) is actually shot by two young directors Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom, both still in their 20s. They were mainly working on TV commercials in Thailand before making feature film debut with ""Shutter"" which went on to become Thailand's biggest hit in 2004. Their profile reminds me of David Fincher who tends to create films with styles over content, but ""Shutter"" is not just about elaborate images and camerawork.The film also resembles some other films made in English-speaking countries - at least, its beginning. We see a college student Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) and a young photographer Tun (Ananda Everingham) at the wedding party for one of Tun's friends. After the party, they head for their home by car at night, but their car hits a woman who fell on the ground and does not move. Getting scary of the accident, they leave the spot without calling the police or hospital.The situation is similar to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" so far. Weird things start to happen around Tun and Jane, but the story takes a completely different direction when they come to learn more about the woman whom they think they might have killed. The story is told in a typically Asian horror fashion, like ""The Ring"" (or ""The Ringu""), ""Grudge"" (or ""Ju-on"" if you like) and ""The Eye,"" connecting the episodes in the past with those in the present.[SPIRIT PHOTOS] One unique point about ""Shutter"" is the use of its photos, especially ""spirit photos"" photos with a strange shadow or face in the picture. It's not the same as the photos David Warner took in ""Omen"" - those used in ""Shutter"" are totally different kind, and the film will show you how different. Like the cursed video of ""The Ring,"" the photos play an important role in the film's otherwise orthodox storytelling, where you find conventional narrative techniques used effectively with the directors' original styles. Some of you might not find the film so scary as they thought, but even they would sometimes think ""how did they shoot that?""Most people would find ""Shutter"" creey and scary, but the film's scare is created not by gore or blood, but by its atmosphere.

1040075,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000LPS3B2,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[4, 7]","I saw this THAI horror film about 3 years ago. I have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from Thailand, and I have seen a fair share of them(Nang nak, the sisters, mae nak, art of the devil series).The film focuses on Tun and his girlfriend Jane. Tun, a photographer reunites with his old friends. On the way home, they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on, Tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them.  Ok, I am not spoiling anything, the story is more complex than it sounds. Tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them, with Jane caught in the middle. As usual, there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people. ""Shutter"" refers to his camera and what it represents. ""Sometimes the dead cannot let go of their loved ones.."" I'm stopping here, I don't want to give out anymore.The plot is not that complex, but believe me when I say, the film is well-made. It does a great job of putting things together, each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present. I didn't see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric, creepy feel to it.  Also, there is a scene in the movie that Tun and Jane looked at ACTUAL photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid.Honestly, this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the ""shock ending"" has the greatest twist of any horror flick I've seen! I've seen a lot of horror films, only THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN ever scared/creeped me out, and SHUTTER came very close. My female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place.Since I haven't seen the TARTAN release and I only own the region-3 DTS-ES rlease from PanMedia (Hong Kong)but Tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the HONG KONG or KOREAN versions. The video is sufficient, with some dark and bright contrast. It is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel. the DTS soundtrack is great though, very crisp and loud. The english subtitles are excellent, the Thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen.A DEFINITE must-see if you are a fan of ASIAN HORROR or horror films in general. It rivals RINGU, ONE MISSED CALL and the original JU-ON 1 and 2.FOUR AND 1/2 STARS!!",4,Finally after 3 years...,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,2336,"['saw', 'THAI', 'horror', 'film', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'say', 'best', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'made', 'Thailand', 'have', 'seen', 'fair', 'share', 'Nang', 'nak', 'sisters', 'mae', 'nak', 'art', 'devil', 'series', '.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'Tun', 'girlfriend', 'Jane', 'Tun', 'photographer', 'old', 'friends', 'way', 'home', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'girl', 'car', 'then', 'Tun', 'ghostly', 'apparitions', 'whenever', 'pictures', 'whenever', 'develop', 'Ok', 'am', 'not', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'story', 'more', 'complex', 'Tun', 'friends', 'have', 'past', 'up', 'Jane', 'caught', 'middle', 'usual', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'going', 'killing', 'people', 'Shutter', 'refers', 'camera', 'what', 'Sometimes', 'dead', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'loved', ""'m"", 'stopping', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'out', 'anymore.The', 'plot', 'not', 'complex', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'film', 'well-made', 'great', 'job', 'putting', 'things', 'together', 'shocking', 'scene', 'linked', 'past', 'present', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'scene', 'wasted', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'creepy', 'feel', 'Also', 'scene', 'movie', 'Tun', 'Jane', 'looked', 'ACTUAL', 'photos', 'ghostly', 'apparitions', 'polaroid.Honestly', 'film', 'great', 'scenes', 'can', 'make', 'hairs', 'back', 'neck', 'stand', 'end', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'shock', 'ending', 'greatest', 'twist', 'horror', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'horror', 'films', 'only', 'THE', 'EXORCIST', 'THE', 'OMEN', 'ever', 'scared/creeped', 'out', 'SHUTTER', 'came', 'very', 'close', 'female', 'friends', 'were', 'scared', 'wits', 'when', 'saw', 'place.Since', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'TARTAN', 'release', 'only', 'own', 'region-3', 'DTS-ES', 'rlease', 'PanMedia', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Tartan', 'usually', 'same', 'transfers', 'HONG', 'KONG', 'KOREAN', 'versions', 'video', 'sufficient', 'dark', 'bright', 'contrast', 'not', 'free', 'grain', 'add', 'atmospheric', 'feel', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'very', 'crisp', 'loud', 'english', 'subtitles', 'are', 'excellent', 'Thai', 'language', 'track', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen.A', 'DEFINITE', 'must-see', 'are', 'fan', 'ASIAN', 'HORROR', 'horror', 'films', 'general', 'RINGU', 'ONE', 'MISSED', 'CALL', 'original', 'JU-ON', '1', '2.FOUR', '1/2', 'STARS']",Shutter The Original
