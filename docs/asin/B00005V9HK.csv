Franco protected the OAS discreetly at the time in Spain for being related to the extreme right wing. The film ""Day of the Jackal"" shows these days.Before that, my parents knew the &quot;Maquis&quot;: the attempt of invading Spain at the finish of II World War across the difficult valley of Aran in the Pyrenees. These experienced ""Red"" guerrillas hardened in two wars and with allied armament thought that the allies would help, but it was not like that and they were exterminated by the Spanish army in a obscure but expeditious form. The last episode was that of the GAL, a parapolicial group which was created in the decade of the 80's to finish with ETA's terrorism, the separatist Basque organization. His methods were coarse and they performed brutally open confrontations sometimes even in the streets of France so the scandal was too big and Spanish government had to stop these crude actions. France  protected for a long time ETA, going on to Spain an invoice for the episode of the OAS. Well, in this movie is shown an equally dark episode on the performance of forces against the IRA.

Also, the formula for this category is that pulling on one thread slowly causes a larger fabric to unravel.  However, here the situation is that one person in the middle of one set of misdeeds happens to be aware of a set of misdeeds only tenuously connected to the first.Additional historical background for non-Brits: A important reference that will be missed by many viewers:  In a conversation with the detective, the RUC commander cites the Birmingham pub bombings as a justification for extralegal means such as torture.  At the time this movie was made, it had been proven in two related cases (the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven) that the police had obtained false confessions by torture, had manufactured and misrepresented evidence, and had surpressed crucial evidence, including information about the actual terrorists.  There was extensive evidence that the Birmingham Six were similarly innocent (with the exception that the identity of the actual bombers was unknown).  Lord Denning, a judge on an aspect of this case, rejected stong physical and testimonial evidence of torture under the reasoning that it was unthinkable that the police would do such.  Aside: US courts use legal technicalities to block such evidence (e.g., that no matter how much evidence the prosecution suppressed and manufactured, it wouldn't have changed the verdict in the original trial).",2,Did not work for me,1149206400,"06 2, 2006",2006,1465,"['did', ""n't"", 'work', 'political', 'thriller', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'known', 'too', 'soon', 'Also', 'formula', 'category', 'pulling', 'one', 'thread', 'slowly', 'larger', 'fabric', 'unravel', 'However', 'here', 'situation', 'one', 'person', 'middle', 'one', 'set', 'misdeeds', 'happens', 'be', 'aware', 'set', 'misdeeds', 'only', 'tenuously', 'connected', 'first.Additional', 'historical', 'background', 'non-Brits', 'important', 'reference', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'many', 'viewers', 'conversation', 'detective', 'RUC', 'commander', 'Birmingham', 'pub', 'bombings', 'justification', 'extralegal', 'means', 'such', 'torture', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'had', 'been', 'proven', 'two', 'related', 'cases', 'Guildford', 'Four', 'Maguire', 'Seven', 'police', 'had', 'obtained', 'false', 'confessions', 'torture', 'had', 'manufactured', 'misrepresented', 'evidence', 'had', 'surpressed', 'crucial', 'evidence', 'including', 'information', 'actual', 'terrorists', 'was', 'extensive', 'evidence', 'Birmingham', 'Six', 'were', 'similarly', 'innocent', 'exception', 'identity', 'actual', 'bombers', 'was', 'unknown', 'Lord', 'Denning', 'judge', 'aspect', 'case', 'rejected', 'stong', 'physical', 'testimonial', 'evidence', 'torture', 'reasoning', 'was', 'unthinkable', 'police', 'would', 'do', 'such', 'Aside', 'US', 'courts', 'use', 'legal', 'technicalities', 'block', 'such', 'evidence', 'e.g.', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'evidence', 'prosecution', 'suppressed', 'manufactured', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'changed', 'verdict', 'original', 'trial']",N/A

688019,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00005V9HK,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[15, 17]","Ken Loach's Hidden Agenda is likely one of the best political thrillers ever made on the troubles in Northern Ireland. The characters are full and rich; the violence is real; and the political cover-ups and corruption are rife. The acting is solid, the plotting is very strong, and the pace of the film is perfect.In particular, drawing in not only the Northern Irish, but also the British and the Americans into the story was a truly inspired move. An American lawyer who fights for civil rights throughout the world is murdered by the Northern Irish police under orders from a high level official and all hell breaks loose. Unlike the flimsy, paltry political cover-ups seen in the film ""Defense of the Realm"" where there are no characters worth caring about, here Brad Dourif as the lawyer, Frances McDormand as his activist girlfriend and especially Brian Cox as the fiercely driven British police officer committed to uncovering the truth make a solid impression on the viewer.Known for his politically charged films, director Ken Loach here never takes a false step. Cox's character, Peter Kerrigan, relentlessly pursues the truth of the backstory behind the murder of the American lawyer and it's really gripping to watch how things unfold.This is a first class thriller, one of the best in its class.

688020,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B00005V9HK,Matthew Kresal,"[2, 2]","Hidden Agenda has been on my list of films to see for a long time now. As a fan of the political thriller genre I was intrigued by its premise. Now, having finally found it and had the opportunity to see it I was presently surprised. The film surpassed my expectations and easily ranks amongst the best political thrillers I've seen.The performances are the staring point of this phenomenal film. Frances McDormand gives a marvelous performance as American civil rights activist Ingrid Jessner as Brian Cox as Kerrigan, the top investigator investigating the death of Jessner's boyfriend. The result is that, together and separately, they give two highly watchable performances that keep your attention focused on the screen. There's also the supporting cast including Brad Dourif as the murdered boyfriend, Maurice Roves as the mysterious army officer Harris who has all the secrets plus Bernard Archard and Patrick Kavanagh as two politicians at the heart of the film's conspiracy.The film is, if nothing else, a conspiracy thriller. What may seem like an odd murder in Northern Ireland soon turns out to be mired in the politics of Thatcher era Britain. The film, while fictional, seems to be far too real for comfort. Writer Jim Allen has crafted a thriller that blends fact and fiction together and so well that the fine line between the two is blurred when it comes to the issues of 1980's Northern Ireland, how Thatcher got herself elected and how governments deal with terrorism. Of even greater surprise is that the plot doesn't overwhelm the dialogue. Unlike some political thrillers, in this film scenes come alive not just from the performances of the actors but from the words on the pages themselves. While it deals with 1980's Northern Ireland one can't help but see the relevant issues ever present in the film nearly twenty years on.On top of the script there's the documentary like approach that makes the film too realistic for comfort. Clive Tickner's cinematography is the main reason this succeeds so well in that it never feels like a Hollywood film. The result is that (thankfully) one gets the feeling of being a fly on the wall for many of the scenes which makes the blurring of fact and fiction even more successful. Add on the realistic costume and production design along with the tight editing of Jonathon Morris and the result is an all too realistic thriller.Hidden Agenda is what a political thriller should be. With its combination of fantastic performances, well written script, its realistic design work and especially its documentary like cinematography make it too realistic to be ignored. While it may deal with 1980's Britain in Northern Ireland it's a thriller with a message too strong to be ignored. It's a first rate and a must see for fans of the genre of the political thriller.",5,An All Too Realistic Thriller,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,2824,"['Hidden', 'Agenda', 'been', 'list', 'films', 'see', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'fan', 'political', 'thriller', 'genre', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'Now', 'having', 'finally', 'found', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'was', 'presently', 'surprised', 'film', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'easily', 'ranks', 'amongst', 'best', 'political', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'seen.The', 'performances', 'are', 'staring', 'point', 'phenomenal', 'film', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'American', 'civil', 'rights', 'activist', 'Ingrid', 'Jessner', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Kerrigan', 'top', 'investigator', 'investigating', 'death', 'Jessner', 'boyfriend', 'result', 'together', 'separately', 'give', 'two', 'highly', 'watchable', 'performances', 'keep', 'attention', 'focused', 'screen', 'also', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'murdered', 'boyfriend', 'Maurice', 'Roves', 'mysterious', 'army', 'officer', 'Harris', 'who', 'secrets', 'Bernard', 'Archard', 'Patrick', 'Kavanagh', 'two', 'politicians', 'heart', 'film', 'conspiracy.The', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'conspiracy', 'thriller', 'What', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'murder', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'soon', 'out', 'be', 'mired', 'politics', 'Thatcher', 'era', 'Britain', 'film', 'fictional', 'be', 'far', 'too', 'real', 'comfort', 'Writer', 'Jim', 'Allen', 'crafted', 'thriller', 'fact', 'fiction', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'fine', 'line', 'two', 'blurred', 'when', 'issues', '1980', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'how', 'Thatcher', 'got', 'elected', 'how', 'governments', 'deal', 'terrorism', 'even', 'greater', 'surprise', 'plot', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'dialogue', 'political', 'thrillers', 'film', 'come', 'alive', 'not', 'just', 'performances', 'actors', 'words', 'pages', '1980', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', 'relevant', 'issues', 'ever', 'present', 'film', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'on.On', 'script', 'documentary', 'approach', 'film', 'too', 'realistic', 'comfort', 'Clive', 'Tickner', 'cinematography', 'main', 'reason', 'so', 'well', 'never', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'result', 'thankfully', 'one', 'feeling', 'being', 'fly', 'wall', 'many', 'scenes', 'blurring', 'fact', 'fiction', 'even', 'more', 'successful', 'Add', 'realistic', 'costume', 'production', 'design', 'tight', 'editing', 'Jonathon', 'Morris', 'result', 'too', 'realistic', 'thriller.Hidden', 'Agenda', 'what', 'political', 'thriller', 'should', 'be', 'combination', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'realistic', 'design', 'work', 'especially', 'documentary', 'cinematography', 'make', 'too', 'realistic', 'be', 'ignored', 'may', 'deal', '1980', 'Britain', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'thriller', 'message', 'too', 'strong', 'be', 'ignored', 'first', 'rate', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'genre', 'political', 'thriller']",N/A
