1132009,A3AWRTFWNEK7FV,B0011NVCAC,Denise,"[0, 1]","This season is so bittersweet because it marks the beginning of the end of a fantastic series that is still my personal favorite TV show...EVER!!!!As we all know, on tv as soon as boy gets girl that marks the beginning of the end of their relationship and/or the show.  Wings was no exception.  I truly felt that  Joe and Helen's 'wedding' was the low point of the show and was the most anti-climatic culmination of a wedding from a whirlwind love affair that I'd ever seen.  Since then I've been equally disappointed with Big and Carrie's 'wedding' but that is another review...Amy Yasbeck's addition was an improvement over Farrah Forke.  She is funny and beautiful and has a nice chemistry with the rest of the cast.  The rest of the cast was stellar as usual and even though I've seen these episodes literally dozens (if not hundreds of times) I still laugh at them.My kids are now hooked on this wonderful show and they anxiously await the last two seasons.  I'm not sharing my disappointment in what's to come. Perhaps after all of this time seeing them again will give me a different perspective on them.Afterall, even BAD Wings was still better than most anything on the tube right now.",5,Beginning of the end...,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,1194,"['season', 'so', 'bittersweet', 'beginning', 'end', 'fantastic', 'series', 'still', 'personal', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'EVER', 'know', 'tv', 'as', 'soon', 'boy', 'girl', 'beginning', 'end', 'relationship', 'show', 'Wings', 'was', 'exception', 'truly', 'felt', 'Joe', 'Helen', ""'wedding"", 'was', 'low', 'point', 'show', 'was', 'most', 'anti-climatic', 'culmination', 'wedding', 'whirlwind', 'love', 'affair', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'then', ""'ve"", 'been', 'equally', 'disappointed', 'Big', 'Carrie', ""'wedding"", 'review', 'Amy', 'Yasbeck', 'addition', 'was', 'improvement', 'Farrah', 'Forke', 'funny', 'beautiful', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'rest', 'cast', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'stellar', 'usual', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'literally', 'dozens', 'not', 'hundreds', 'times', 'still', 'laugh', 'them.My', 'kids', 'are', 'now', 'hooked', 'wonderful', 'show', 'anxiously', 'await', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'sharing', 'disappointment', 'what', 'come', 'Perhaps', 'time', 'seeing', 'again', 'will', 'give', 'different', 'perspective', 'them.Afterall', 'even', 'BAD', 'Wings', 'was', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'anything', 'tube', 'right', 'now']",Wings: Season 6

1132011,AEJ0EGQ79Y0KK,B0011NVCAC,Gareth Mc Bride,"[8, 8]","Get set to laugh as the classic sixth season of Wings has arrived from Paramount Home Entertainment.Set on Nantucket Island, the series followed the exploits of Sandpiper Airlines, a small one plane operation that commutes between the Island and Boston as well as other points of interest.  The airline is owned by Joe Hackett (Timothy Daly), who is a stickler for details and a solid if unexciting individual.The laughs start to fly when the supporting cast comes into play, as the characters all have a very interesting history.  There is Helen (Crystal Bernard).  an aspiring Cellist who runs the airport lunch counter.  She has been friends with Brian and Joe since childhood but was hampered by her weight which she lost in becoming a very attractive lady.  Then there is Lowell (Thomas Hayden Church), the simple, yet eccentric mechanic, who is a whiz with planes as he is with oddball saying and situations.Rounding out the cast are Rebecca Schull as Faye, a former airline hostess who has buried her past three husbands, and who runs the counter at Sandpiper, and Roy Biggins, (David Schramm), who owns a much larger airline chain that competes with SandpiperThe season opens with Helen leaving for New York to marry the wealthy Davis Lynch after spending a night with Joe. Joe follows Helen and convinces her to accept his marriage proposal.  Hilarious consequences ensue as the duo plans for their wedding and have to deal with the arrival of Helen's sister Casey (Amy Yasbeck), who has had to abandon her socialite ways after being dumped by her husband.  As the season progresses, we get to see Joe and Helen plan for their wedding, Case and Brian deal with their lot in life, and Antonio (Tony Shalhoub) the cab driver deal with fealings for his Cousins Fiance as well as his desires for Casey which he is unable to utter.Some of the best moments include Lowel purchasing a wax museum, Debbie Reynolds and Helen's mom and a psychotic air traffic controller. All of which leads to one of the most humor filled weddings ever filmedNever a dull moment, this set will keep you laughing.While most shows start to fade after their first couple of seasons, this show keeps getting stronger and this is a collection for fans and collectors alike.5 stars out of 5",5,Get Ready To Laugh,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,2267,"['Get', 'set', 'laugh', 'classic', 'sixth', 'season', 'Wings', 'arrived', 'Paramount', 'Home', 'Entertainment.Set', 'Nantucket', 'Island', 'series', 'followed', 'exploits', 'Sandpiper', 'Airlines', 'small', 'one', 'plane', 'operation', 'Island', 'Boston', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'points', 'interest', 'airline', 'owned', 'Joe', 'Hackett', 'Timothy', 'Daly', 'who', 'stickler', 'details', 'solid', 'unexciting', 'individual.The', 'laughs', 'start', 'fly', 'when', 'supporting', 'cast', 'play', 'characters', 'have', 'very', 'interesting', 'history', 'Helen', 'Crystal', 'Bernard', 'aspiring', 'Cellist', 'who', 'airport', 'lunch', 'counter', 'been', 'friends', 'Brian', 'Joe', 'childhood', 'was', 'hampered', 'weight', 'lost', 'becoming', 'very', 'attractive', 'lady', 'Then', 'Lowell', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'simple', 'yet', 'eccentric', 'mechanic', 'who', 'whiz', 'planes', 'oddball', 'saying', 'situations.Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Rebecca', 'Schull', 'Faye', 'former', 'airline', 'hostess', 'who', 'buried', 'past', 'three', 'husbands', 'who', 'counter', 'Sandpiper', 'Roy', 'Biggins', 'David', 'Schramm', 'who', 'much', 'larger', 'airline', 'chain', 'SandpiperThe', 'season', 'Helen', 'leaving', 'New', 'York', 'marry', 'wealthy', 'Davis', 'Lynch', 'spending', 'night', 'Joe', 'Joe', 'Helen', 'accept', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Hilarious', 'consequences', 'ensue', 'duo', 'plans', 'wedding', 'have', 'deal', 'arrival', 'Helen', 'sister', 'Casey', 'Amy', 'Yasbeck', 'who', 'had', 'abandon', 'socialite', 'ways', 'being', 'dumped', 'husband', 'season', 'get', 'see', 'Joe', 'Helen', 'plan', 'wedding', 'Case', 'Brian', 'deal', 'lot', 'life', 'Antonio', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'cab', 'driver', 'deal', 'fealings', 'Cousins', 'Fiance', 'as', 'well', 'desires', 'Casey', 'unable', 'utter.Some', 'best', 'moments', 'include', 'Lowel', 'purchasing', 'wax', 'museum', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Helen', 'mom', 'psychotic', 'air', 'traffic', 'controller', 'one', 'most', 'humor', 'filled', 'weddings', 'ever', 'filmedNever', 'dull', 'moment', 'set', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing.While', 'most', 'shows', 'start', 'fade', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'show', 'getting', 'stronger', 'collection', 'fans', 'collectors', 'alike.5', '5']",Wings: Season 6

Alex is history and they introduce us to Helen's sister Casey and Antonio is madly in love with her.  The best part about this season is they applied tags at the end of each episode as the credit were rolling.  Oftentimes, the tags were as funny as the rest of the episode.  There are too many great episodes to list but my favorites are: ""The Waxman Cometh"", Lowell sinks his inheritance into a floundering wax museum.  The use of wax figures in this episode was hilarious.*Lowell is showing the gang The Beverly Hillbillies exhibit*Lowell: Come listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed.Brian:  There is no Jed.Lowell:  The previous owner was quite a gambler and lost Jed in a poker game.Helen:  Where's Ellie Mae?Lowell:  Did I also mention that the previous owner was also a widower?""Is That a Ten Foot Sandwich or Are You Just Glad to See Me?"", The introduction to a running gag of The Big Sandwich. ""All's Fare"" Antonio becomes the driver of a visiting businessman who has his eye on Casey.  Antonio finds out the man has a family and spills the beans to Casey.  A very touching ending.  ""Have I Got a Couple for You"", Joe and Helen meet another couple but become too clingy.

1132015,A3OH101U0CPUC7,B0011NVCAC,Joseph Boone,"[5, 5]","Most comedies hit their stride in their second season. It usually takes that long to get a good handle on the characters and really get things humming. While Wings was certainly good by Season Two, I personally believe that it wasn't until Season Six that it truly hit its peak. The often wooden Alex departed and was replaced by Helen's sister, Casey. Casey was comedy gold and added an energy that the show had lacked up to this point. The writing also seems to have taken a step forward and the number of laugh-out-loud funny moments goes way up from past seasons.If you've never watched Wings, you probably don't want to come in quite this late... you should probably go back toWings - The Complete Third Seasonat least.

I thought her and Brian's chemistry was great, and it was nice for Helen to have an ally. When Helen's sister arrives in season six, however, she quickly won me over, as a smart, interesting and funny character. (Although I have to admit, I would love to have had both her and Alex along for the ride). As with most sitcoms, after six years, you're bound to have stories that stretch too far at times, but, to me, ""Wings"" in season six is still fresh and entertaining, and it promted me to finish out the set of all eight seasons, which I originally wasn't planning on doing... sorry about that, walet. This was also, unfortunately, the final season of Lowell, as Thomas Hayden Church left to star in his own series. The best part of a show like this is, it's an ensemble piece.
