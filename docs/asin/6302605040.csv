322568,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302605040,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","But mostly yes.One of those small films I'd never heard of yet stumbled upon while scanning through TCM's playlist, `Pressure Point' is a stirring drama about a psychologist at odds with a very jarring patient.  In this 1962 film, Sidney Poitier plays the doctor who is given the assignment of caring for a Nazi dealing with a bout of insomnia.  This Nazi, played with a ferocity I didn't expect from Bobby Darin, is condescending and almost bitter at the fact that his doctor is black, and he relishes in spewing his propaganda and his questionable lifestyle on the doctor every chance he gets.The film really pits Poitier against Darin in more ways than one, and Darin comes out the victor in the end, while Poitier's doctor may be the film's obvious hero.  Darin's acting is triumphant here, for her really sinks into every emotional cavity of this man.  He reminded me a bit of an amalgam of both Edward Norton's Oscar nominated roles (if you're unfamiliar, he was nominated for both American History X and Primal Fear).  Darin surprised me.  I know of Darin by his music, and that musical Kevin Spacey starred in, but I had yet to see him act.  He was certainly one of those singer/actors who made it work on both accounts.  Poitier is less successful, but I've never been a complete fan of his work.  I really loved what he did in both `A Raisin in the Sun' and `Edge of the City', his two finest roles by a long shot, but overall he comes across very stiff and mannered to me.  He overemphasizes all of his emotions and tends to play one emotion throughout.I know I'm in the minority here, but it is how I feel.Overall, this is a pretty good film, but I digress.  There is one scene that I just can't take seriously and it's one of those scenes that put a permanent stain on the film, in my opinion.  I'm talking about the `tic-tac-toe' scene, and when you see it you'll understand.  It just is so bizarre and nonsensical that it takes me out of what Darin and the film itself has been building up until that point.  Despite that, the imagery is outstanding (especially in that scene) with some delicious cinematography.Still, I really liked this movie and as one of those rare gems no one knows about, it stands out!",4,Yes-and-no...,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,2224,"['mostly', 'yes.One', 'small', 'films', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'yet', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'scanning', 'TCM', 'playlist', 'Pressure', 'Point', 'stirring', 'drama', 'psychologist', 'odds', 'very', 'jarring', 'patient', '1962', 'film', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'doctor', 'who', 'given', 'assignment', 'caring', 'Nazi', 'dealing', 'bout', 'insomnia', 'Nazi', 'played', 'ferocity', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'condescending', 'almost', 'bitter', 'fact', 'doctor', 'black', 'spewing', 'propaganda', 'questionable', 'lifestyle', 'doctor', 'chance', 'film', 'really', 'Poitier', 'Darin', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Darin', 'out', 'victor', 'end', 'Poitier', 'doctor', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'obvious', 'hero', 'Darin', 'acting', 'triumphant', 'here', 'really', 'sinks', 'emotional', 'cavity', 'man', 'reminded', 'bit', 'amalgam', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'roles', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'was', 'nominated', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'Darin', 'surprised', 'know', 'Darin', 'music', 'musical', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'starred', 'had', 'yet', 'see', 'act', 'was', 'certainly', 'one', 'singer/actors', 'who', 'made', 'work', 'accounts', 'Poitier', 'less', 'successful', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'complete', 'fan', 'work', 'really', 'loved', 'what', 'did', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'Edge', 'City', 'two', 'finest', 'roles', 'long', 'shot', 'overall', 'very', 'stiff', 'mannered', 'emotions', 'tends', 'play', 'one', 'emotion', 'throughout.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'minority', 'here', 'how', 'feel.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'digress', 'one', 'scene', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'one', 'scenes', 'put', 'permanent', 'stain', 'film', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'talking', 'tic-tac-toe', 'scene', 'when', 'see', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'just', 'so', 'bizarre', 'nonsensical', 'what', 'Darin', 'film', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'point', 'imagery', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'scene', 'delicious', 'cinematography.Still', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'one', 'rare', 'one', 'out']",N/A
322569,A3HMOQO8J0SOC3,6302605040,"bix lang ""pastafagiole""","[33, 35]","""Pressure Point"" is a thinking person's film, dealing with the topic of a seditious, neo-Nazi (Darin) during World War II, and the prison psyciatrist (Portier)whose job it is to determine whether the young man is sane or insane. While Portier gives an excellent, understated performance, it is Bobby Darin's film from start to finish. The young Darin (only 25 when this film was made) portrays the unbalanced, hateful neo-Nazi with a realism that is frightening. He swings from moody, pensive philosophizing to acerbic, irascible mania in the drop of a hat, without skipping a beat. At the same time, he evokes sympathy from the viewer who comes to realize that the deranged prisoner was brought up in a psychopathic family. An incredible, thought-provoking performance by a legendary talent. No wonder that Darin won the Cannes Film Festival and Golden Globe Awards as Best Actor for this performance. It was a real injustice that he was not nominated for an Academy Award. It was known in Hollywood circles that many critics who praised Darin's performance refused to push for his nomination because they were turned-off by his allegedly arrogant demeanor. Sadly, Darin's awareness of his imminent mortality instilled in him a fierce desire to succeed before his time ran out. This competitiveness was erroneously interpreted by many as ""arrogance"". It would take Darin another great performance the following year (1963) in ""Captain Newman, M.D."" for him to garner an Academy Award nomination.  In this film Darin gives an equally impressive performance as a shell-shocked WWII fighter pilot. Besides being a legendary vocalist and the highest-paid Cabaret performer in the history of Las Vegas at the time of his death (Sinatra was second), Darin was also a superb actor who could do drama and comedy with equal ease. Darin's career was limited and his life was cut short by heart disease. One can only guess how far he would have gone had he not required oxogen after every performance, as well as a series of open heart surgeries. In fact, he died on the operating table on December 20, 1973 at the age of 37.

I admire the effort and the finished product.  The subject matter seems fresh and topical, sadly..., tho' the director's style seems a bit over the top.*  And, as others have noted the director should NOT have done the commentary when he could hardly talk.As also noted by almost every reviewer Bobby Darin was fantastic.  Yeah, he really could act.  Big time.  And I think if he was born nowdays, after Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino showed that men who look like normal people could become stars, he'd have been a major motion picture star.  But he didn't look the part in the early 60's so he had to content himself with being a singing superstar.Bobby's performance here was subdued yet powerful.  Just stunning.  He makes his character impossible to dismiss, and therefore all the more thought provoking and, as The Doctor notes, all the more terrifying.Stanley Kramer wisely opted not to wrap this movie in a happy Hollywood bow, overruling the director by reshooting the ending (with Darin's approval and cooperation) to keep it bleak and realistic.  It was a gutsy thing to do and probably lost it a lot of fans and ticket sales, but certainly earned my respect (for what that's worth).*Spoiler Footnote:Tho', as a cinematographer the director did have an eye for a good shot, like the one where a (fore)shadow from a window blind string hangs by The Patient/Darin like a noose as he's in a counciling session with The Doctor....",5,Bobby Darin's best dramatic performance in a worthwhile movie,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,1570,"['Everyone', 'associated', 'movie', 'was', 'brave', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'producer', 'Cornfeld', 'Director', 'stars', 'Poitier', 'Darin', 'admire', 'effort', 'finished', 'product', 'subject', 'matter', 'fresh', 'topical', 'sadly', 'director', 'style', 'bit', 'top', '*', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'director', 'should', 'NOT', 'have', 'done', 'commentary', 'when', 'could', 'hardly', 'talk.As', 'also', 'noted', 'almost', 'reviewer', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Yeah', 'really', 'could', 'act', 'Big', 'time', 'think', 'was', 'born', 'nowdays', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'showed', 'men', 'who', 'look', 'normal', 'people', 'could', 'become', 'stars', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'star', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'part', 'early', '60', 'so', 'had', 'content', 'being', 'singing', 'superstar.Bobby', 'performance', 'here', 'was', 'subdued', 'yet', 'powerful', 'Just', 'stunning', 'character', 'impossible', 'dismiss', 'therefore', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Doctor', 'notes', 'more', 'terrifying.Stanley', 'Kramer', 'wisely', 'opted', 'not', 'wrap', 'movie', 'happy', 'Hollywood', 'bow', 'overruling', 'director', 'reshooting', 'ending', 'Darin', 'approval', 'cooperation', 'keep', 'bleak', 'realistic', 'was', 'gutsy', 'thing', 'do', 'probably', 'lost', 'lot', 'fans', 'ticket', 'sales', 'certainly', 'earned', 'respect', 'what', 'worth', '*Spoiler', 'Footnote', 'Tho', 'cinematographer', 'director', 'did', 'have', 'eye', 'good', 'shot', 'one', 'where', 'fore', 'shadow', 'window', 'string', 'hangs', 'Patient/Darin', 'noose', 'counciling', 'session', 'Doctor']",N/A
322573,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302605040,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 3]","Although the genesis of hate crimes is worthy of a film treatment, this heavy-handed 1962 melodrama is weighed down by too many theatrical flourishes to be as genuinely powerful as was once intended. Some critics at the time praised the bravery of such an undertaking, but one can see in hindsight how director Hubert Cornfield, who co-wrote the screenplay with Robert Lindner, doesn't seem to trust the basic material enough to provide a more straightforward telling of the case history of a psychopathic convict who hates non-Aryans with a virulent passion. To further depersonalize the plot, he doesn't even give the characters proper names. As a typically austere Stanley Kramer production, it has the earmarks of the high-minded social consciousness prevalent in the comparatively better films he made during this period - 1959'sOn the Beachabout nuclear disarmament, 1961'sJudgment at Nurembergabout the Nazi atrocities and 1963'sA Child Is Waitingabout mental retardation.As a framing device for the central story, a chief psychiatrist is confronted by a frustrated staff doctor threatening to resign due to the seeming hopelessness of getting through to an anti-white black patient. Hoping to convince the younger doctor not to give up, the psychiatrist - who happens to be black - flashes back to a similarly difficult case he handled during WWII when he was forced to treat a Nazi supporter who was in jail for sedition. The convict is a vicious racist and anti-Semitic, who is suffering from a sleep disorder and blackouts. The bulk of the movie is the dialogue between the two over the course of the convict's three-year sentence. What emerges is a portrait of a pathetic man who had a miserable childhood that led to random acts of sadism and ultimately his membership in the American Nazi (Bund) party.Fantasy sequences and documentary footage are liberally used to emphasize the convict's malignant nature with melodramatic excess. The film's turning point is the decision to release the unrepentant convict, which pits the heretofore becalmed psychiatrist against the prison authorities convinced he should be paroled. As late as this comes in the movie, it's the only point where Sidney Poitier's performance as the psychiatrist comes alive. In fact, his fury is so characteristically electrifying that he replicated the scene on a more subtle level in the father-son showdown in Kramer's laterGuess Who's Coming to Dinner.  As the convict, Bobby Darin gets the showier role, and while he is up to the challenge, he doesn't transcend it either. Peter Falk shows up briefly in the present-day scenes, while Carl Benton Reid adds some dimension to his small role as the chief medical officer. It all ends anti-climactically.

322574,A2IY9M330NKBW6,6302605040,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 2]","I hadn't seen this film in well over 30 years but recall being quite moved by it. I thought it might be worth revisiting and I was right.Here's the scoop. Sidney Poitier plays a prison psychiatrist in the early 40s, well before African Americans occupied that part of society. He begins work with an inmate, Bobby Darin, who is in for sedition. Darin is a racist and anti-semite who is a member of the American Nazi Party and Poitier feels that no amount of treatment will cure him of his deep-seated hatred, but he works with him as best he can.Stanley Kramer produced this and has brought many films to the screen that were centered on significant social issues. This is no exception. Released in 1962 but set in 1942, it deals with racism but is set against the mentality of the Nazis who were on the move across Europe. It is a drama with very few sets. Everything is in the writing and acting. It is certainly a bit on the preachy side, particularly in Poitier's final pro-American monolog, but it works and is powerful. It feeds into the myth that is America. The arguments are good on both sides of the fence, but Poitier's point, that things might not be great (or even good) for the black man in America, but at least they're moving in the right direction, works well given what happened under the Nazi philosophy. History has proven him correct.This is generally directed well. Some of the flashback scenes look a bit hokey now but they get the point across. Poitier is his usual great self and Bobby Darin, though not really known as an actor, does more than credible job. Films like this need to be seen. Sometimes the misery index experienced by many Americans leads them to look for an enemy. This film shows the consequences of that mind set.",4,Worth Revisiting,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,1757,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'well', '30', 'years', 'recall', 'being', 'quite', 'moved', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'was', 'scoop', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'prison', 'psychiatrist', 'early', '40s', 'well', 'African', 'Americans', 'occupied', 'part', 'society', 'work', 'inmate', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'who', 'sedition', 'Darin', 'racist', 'anti-semite', 'who', 'member', 'American', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'Poitier', 'feels', 'amount', 'treatment', 'will', 'cure', 'deep-seated', 'hatred', 'as', 'best', 'can.Stanley', 'Kramer', 'produced', 'brought', 'many', 'films', 'screen', 'were', 'centered', 'significant', 'social', 'issues', 'exception', 'Released', '1962', 'set', '1942', 'racism', 'set', 'mentality', 'Nazis', 'who', 'were', 'move', 'Europe', 'drama', 'very', 'few', 'sets', 'Everything', 'writing', 'acting', 'certainly', 'bit', 'preachy', 'side', 'particularly', 'Poitier', 'final', 'pro-American', 'monolog', 'powerful', 'myth', 'America', 'arguments', 'are', 'good', 'sides', 'fence', 'Poitier', 'point', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'even', 'good', 'black', 'man', 'America', 'least', ""'re"", 'moving', 'right', 'direction', 'well', 'given', 'what', 'happened', 'Nazi', 'philosophy', 'History', 'proven', 'correct.This', 'generally', 'directed', 'well', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'look', 'bit', 'hokey', 'now', 'get', 'point', 'Poitier', 'usual', 'great', 'self', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'not', 'really', 'known', 'actor', 'more', 'credible', 'job', 'Films', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'Sometimes', 'misery', 'index', 'experienced', 'many', 'Americans', 'look', 'enemy', 'film', 'consequences', 'mind', 'set']",N/A
322575,A16VH7SPVPVJKV,6302605040,Harvey M. Canter,"[3, 3]","This is a truly excellent & powerful film that portrays the tense therapeutic relationship between a prison psychiatrist (Poitier) and a self-exalted American Nazi upstart (Darrin). Although incarcerated for sedition, Darrin's real imprisonment is within his own mind and persecutory complexes. and he suffers agonizing panic attacks, which results in his having to submit to therapy at the hands of someone he considers his inferior. He learns that his terrors are really the eruption of PTSD symptoms, and that his whole enterprise of hatred is a compensatory mask covering his deeper feelings of rage and inferioriy. Does this knowledge change him, however? To answer that question, you'll need--and want--to see the entire film and decide for yourself.At the same time, this couch-opera is also an allegory about race relations, and perhaps about the spiritual battle between the forces of light/truth and darkness/deception--which is NOT protrayed lining up as Caucasian = light/truth and Black = darkness/deception, quite the opposite--even if one wants to be so literal about it. This film never takes the simple way out--it confronts unsavory hatred & bigotry, tackles some very subtle points about the process of psychotherapy, and portrays in painful detail the genesis (via graphic, bizarre parental abuse/neglect/cruelty) of a young man with an Antisocial Personality Disorder. Rather ambitious, I'd say!!There are some pretty far-out special effects in this film, and even though perhaps crude by today's standards, they are still gripping and effective. As Darrin reluctantly unfolds his story in flashbacks, there are some excellent supporting performances by the actors portraying the parents and the Darrin-as-a-youngster character. Also, look for a young, earnest, sincerely befuddled, and non-trenchcoated Peter Falk in the framing story as a novice psychiatrist confessing his professional failures to the older, more experienced Poitier as his supervisor.While I have not heard the commentary on the DVD, I can verify one other reviewer's surmise about director Kornfeld having medical problems and speaking through an electronic voice box. In the early 90's I saw Kornfeld speak at a showing of this film and 'Night of the Following Day' and while his remarks were hard to decipher, one could not help but admire his courage and erudition that shown through his handicap. He clearly had to struggle to make these dark, non-traditional films HIS way, and some pretty choice talent was happy to go along with him.For clinical background contemporary to the making of this film, one might read texts such as 'The Authoritarian Personality' (Adorno, et.al.), Lindner's 'Fifty-Minute Hour' or perhaps John Bowlby's 'Forty-Four Juvenile Thieves' or Aichorn's 'Wayward Youth'.

Even as he helps Darin conquer his personal demons, Poitier realizes that his patient remains an unrepentant threat to society.  Worse, he finds that Darin has fooled the rest of the staff into believing he has reformed.  Darin cunningly taunts Poitier by explaining how easily the visceral appeal of his ""cause"" is spread to those inclined to hate and blame minorities for their problems.  The doctor's restraint, intelligence, and ultimate effectiveness in helping his patient wins the latter's apparent personal admiration but does not change said patient's overall racist beliefs.For brevity I keep citing the actors but of course the credit belongs as well to screenwriters Hubert Cornfield and S. Lee Peterson.  Cornfield, who also directed, contributes an audio commentary that is sadly all but unlistenable due to his obvious ill health.  I would have liked to learn how the two actors got along during filming, but I just couldn't get through more than a few minutes of the commentary.Peter Falk appears briefly at the beginning and end of ""Pressure Point,"" but a far more impressive supporting role is that of young Barry Gordon as the childhood version of the Darin character's psycho-in-training.I highly recommend this to fans of Poitier and Darin, as well as to anyone with the stomach for a deeper-than-usual examination of the unfortunate (and unfortunately continuing) appeal--to some--of white supremacist movements.",4,Lost Classic's Handling of Racism is Sadly Still Relevant Today,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,1628,"['Bobby', 'Darin', 'own', 'great', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'intense', 'psychological', 'duel', 'black', 'prison', 'psychiatrist', 'charismatic', 'white', 'supremacist', 'patient', 'angling', 'parole', 'Even', 'Darin', 'conquer', 'personal', 'demons', 'Poitier', 'patient', 'unrepentant', 'threat', 'society', 'Worse', 'Darin', 'fooled', 'rest', 'staff', 'believing', 'reformed', 'Darin', 'cunningly', 'taunts', 'Poitier', 'explaining', 'how', 'easily', 'visceral', 'appeal', 'cause', 'spread', 'inclined', 'hate', 'blame', 'minorities', 'problems', 'doctor', 'restraint', 'intelligence', 'ultimate', 'effectiveness', 'helping', 'patient', 'latter', 'apparent', 'personal', 'admiration', 'not', 'change', 'said', 'patient', 'overall', 'racist', 'beliefs.For', 'brevity', 'keep', 'citing', 'actors', 'course', 'credit', 'belongs', 'as', 'well', 'screenwriters', 'Hubert', 'Cornfield', 'S.', 'Lee', 'Peterson', 'Cornfield', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'audio', 'commentary', 'sadly', 'unlistenable', 'due', 'obvious', 'ill', 'health', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'learn', 'how', 'two', 'actors', 'got', 'along', 'filming', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'commentary.Peter', 'Falk', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'end', 'Pressure', 'Point', 'far', 'more', 'impressive', 'supporting', 'role', 'young', 'Barry', 'Gordon', 'childhood', 'version', 'Darin', 'character', 'psycho-in-training.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Poitier', 'Darin', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'stomach', 'deeper-than-usual', 'examination', 'unfortunate', 'unfortunately', 'continuing', 'appeal', 'white', 'supremacist', 'movements']",N/A

One is hardly a surprise: it's given by award-winning actor and screen legend Sidney Poitier, who plays a principled prison psychologist with characteristic dignity and aplomb.  The other is an unexpected tour-de-force delivered by Bobby Darin, who is perhaps best remembered for his singing talents rather than his acting chops.  Darin plays a racist, anti-Semitic prisoner who has embraced Nazism, and has been jailed on a charge of sedition.  When Poitier is assigned the task of delving into Darin's mental and emotional history, the two men enter into a volatile relationship that eventually strips away their psychological defenses, setting the stage for a raw and bitter final confrontation.Produced by Stanley Kramer, the film is ably directed by Hubert Cornfield and strikingly photographed by veteran cinematographer Ernest Haller, who had won an Oscar for his work on ""Gone With the Wind"" and whose previous film had been the stylish ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"".  Ernest Gold's fine jazz score contributes immensely to the film's impact, and the title sequence is a work of art in itself, as is the film's provocative theatrical trailer.""Pressure Point"" is still a topical film today.  It wasn't a commercial success when first released, although it did receive some excellent reviews and even garnered a Golden Globe nomination for Bobby Darin as Best Actor in a Leading Role (Drama).
