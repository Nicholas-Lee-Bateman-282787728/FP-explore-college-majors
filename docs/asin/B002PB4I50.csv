1282752,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002PB4I50,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Some movies are just dumb.  It's sad when those said movies star talented actors.  Jeff Bridges is one of the best ever born, and Justin Timberlake is more than a pretty face (he can sing, he can dance and...yes, he can act).  Still, they cannot save a boring and ill-advised `father/son' bonding film from being anything but what it is, boring and ill-advised.  The storyline is a mixed bag of preposterous and clich&eacute;d and the direction is so generic that it bears repeating.  I just wish that there had been some spark to be had here, but instead we get Bridges muddling through `too familiar' territory with nothing to really color in and Timberlake pouting and trying his hardest not to appear uninteresting.  Oh yeah, and Oscar nominee Rooney Mara's less talented yet more famous sister is here to play Timberlake's would be/should be flame who really warrants no mention whatsoever.  I would have loved to like this.  It's nice to have a light and frothy warm hearted film every once in a while.

1282753,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002PB4I50,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Open Road is definitely a disappointment for a couple different reasons.  For one thing, Jeff Bridges plays a fairly annoying father character more often than not.Alright *sometimes* he's not so bad, such as -to mention the storyline in small detail- whenever Bridges son tries forcing his father to come back home and visit his ex-wife (the sons mother) in the hospital, and the character of Jeff Bridges constantly finds sneaky ways to get out of it such as sneaking off to a bar, sneaking into a bathroom, or just putting on an unexpected disappearing act.  Or was that woman supposed to be his *current* wife?  Who knows.  The storyline was hardly ever specific enough because it never developed to its full potential.The film is supposed to be a light comedy with a sprinkle of drama elements to make you feel satisfied by the end of the movie, but well... the ""feel good"" moments are more like ""feel like total crap"" because they aren't actually any good either.  These particular segments focus on the teenage boy bringing his girlfriend to the location of Jeff Bridges, everyone getting into needless fights with each other in the middle of nowhere, and bringing the father back to the boys mother.In addition to that, the storyline focuses on the confusing relationship troubles between both the son and his girlfriend.  So if anything, the film is supposed to show viewers what it's like for two adults to have relationship difficulties as well as two teens.Yes that's right- I mention a trip.  Jeff Bridges, his teenage son and the girlfriend all travel across country on a road trip (and mostly find themselves in the small towns and fields of Kentucky).  Now I've seen my share of ""country road trip"" type films over the last 10 years, and this one is CLEARLY inferior to most.  It's one boring trip, that's for sure!Jeff Bridges just never came across as an interesting enough main character to keep my attention very long.  Throughout the entire film, the only time I laughed was the moment where he got into a fight with his son, stormed out of the car, and fell over on the ground.  That was the ultimate moment of humor there... and it stunk.I don't even recall any mention of why the mother was in the hospital to begin with.  Just that she insisted her son bring Jeff Bridges to her NOW.  I won't spoil what happens at the end, but let's just say, it was extremely melodramatic, making the build-up and the whole road trip very unsatisfying and pointless.  All the frequent baseball talk was pointless too.The film is extremely brief at just over 80 minutes, and feels undeveloped and lacks focus most of the time.  A pretty big letdown.",2,mediocre attempt at captivation,1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,2661,"['Open', 'Road', 'definitely', 'disappointment', 'couple', 'different', 'reasons', 'one', 'thing', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'fairly', 'annoying', 'father', 'character', 'more', 'often', 'not.Alright', '*sometimes*', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'such', '-to', 'mention', 'storyline', 'small', 'detail-', 'whenever', 'Bridges', 'son', 'tries', 'forcing', 'father', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'visit', 'ex-wife', 'sons', 'mother', 'hospital', 'character', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'constantly', 'sneaky', 'ways', 'get', 'such', 'sneaking', 'off', 'bar', 'sneaking', 'bathroom', 'just', 'putting', 'unexpected', 'disappearing', 'act', 'was', 'woman', 'supposed', 'be', '*current*', 'wife', 'Who', 'storyline', 'was', 'hardly', 'ever', 'specific', 'enough', 'never', 'developed', 'full', 'potential.The', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'light', 'comedy', 'sprinkle', 'drama', 'elements', 'make', 'feel', 'satisfied', 'end', 'movie', 'well', 'feel', 'good', 'moments', 'are', 'more', 'feel', 'total', 'crap', 'are', ""n't"", 'actually', 'good', 'either', 'particular', 'segments', 'focus', 'teenage', 'boy', 'bringing', 'girlfriend', 'location', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'everyone', 'getting', 'needless', 'fights', 'other', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'bringing', 'father', 'back', 'boys', 'mother.In', 'addition', 'storyline', 'confusing', 'relationship', 'troubles', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'So', 'anything', 'film', 'supposed', 'show', 'viewers', 'what', 'two', 'adults', 'have', 'relationship', 'difficulties', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'teens.Yes', 'right-', 'mention', 'trip', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'teenage', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'travel', 'country', 'road', 'trip', 'mostly', 'find', 'small', 'towns', 'fields', 'Kentucky', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'share', 'country', 'road', 'trip', 'type', 'films', 'last', '10', 'years', 'one', 'CLEARLY', 'inferior', 'most', 'one', 'boring', 'trip', 'sure', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'just', 'never', 'came', 'interesting', 'enough', 'main', 'character', 'keep', 'attention', 'very', 'long', 'entire', 'film', 'only', 'time', 'laughed', 'was', 'moment', 'where', 'got', 'fight', 'son', 'stormed', 'car', 'fell', 'over', 'ground', 'was', 'ultimate', 'moment', 'humor', 'stunk.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'recall', 'mention', 'why', 'mother', 'was', 'hospital', 'begin', 'Just', 'insisted', 'son', 'bring', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'NOW', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'end', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'extremely', 'melodramatic', 'making', 'build-up', 'whole', 'road', 'trip', 'very', 'unsatisfying', 'pointless', 'frequent', 'baseball', 'talk', 'was', 'pointless', 'too.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'brief', 'just', '80', 'minutes', 'feels', 'undeveloped', 'focus', 'most', 'time', 'pretty', 'big', 'letdown']",N/A

1282758,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B002PB4I50,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","As Jeff Bridges, to me, has always been one of the most underrated actors of his period--I'm glad to see him finally getting the recognition he deserves. His recent Oscar win for ""Crazy Heart"" is just a capper on his previous four nominations (The Last Picture Show, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, Starman, and The Contender) which spanned nearly 40 years.  Aside from ""Picture Show,"" these films only hint at Bridges' range and I've always maintained that his best work often flew under the radar (Tucker: The Man And His Dream, The Fisher King, the incredible Oscar worthy Fearless, and dare I mention The Dude from The Big Lebowski) and were the true heights of his acting genius. It's only natural that Bridges has settled into somewhat of a comfort zone and ""The Open Road"" is a film he could do in his sleep. Playing a disheveled and obstinate man in a mid-life crisis has been Bridges' go-to role for several years now and it's on display again in this dysfunctional road trip dramedy.Justin Timberlake plays a struggling minor league ball player who is distressed to learn that his mother (Mary Steenburgen) is in need of a heart operation.  She refuses the procedure unless her ex-husband (Timberlake's father Bridges) comes to see her.  Bridges plays a former baseball champion now boozing through his glory years signing autographs and reliving past successes.  Needless to say, his relationship with his son is fairly non-existent and suitably strained.  Timberlake and faithful gal pal (and former girlfriend) Kate Mara fly out to retrieve Bridges at a baseball convention.  Of course, if this were the real world--there wouldn't be much drama to this scenario.  But through movie magic and contrived situations, the three are forced into a road trip across country.  It's not the least bit believable, but are these things ever?  What do you suspect might happen?  If I have to tell you, you don't see many movies!  There are plenty of confrontations between Bridges and Timberlake, unexpected bonding, mild humor and anything else that might provoke a new understanding between the central characters.Many people I know have attacked this movie due to Timberlake (this was prior to him appearing in higher profile roles).  In truth, he's fine.  I appreciated that he actually wanted to do something more low key and small to develop his talent.  Bridges is, of course, a reliable trooper.  But the movie's secret weapon, to my mind, is the thoroughly charming Mara.  I've liked her for years (check out Transsiberian if you haven't seen it), but here she really gets a chance to hold her own.  Look, nothing in ""The Open Road"" will surprise you from a plotting standpoint--but it is an agreeable and amiable diversion.  I certainly liked it, but its lack of surprises or originality keep it firmly grounded as a pleasant, but not great, experience.  If you are a fan of any of the principles, check this out.  Slight and predictable, but fairly engaging nevertheless.
