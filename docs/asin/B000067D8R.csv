After watching it I was glad to see the Olsens are continuing to handle their potential influence in a positive manner. Okay, okay I know, so they get everything they wish, including fantasy parents and a sweet car. But hey, if you had a say in the making of your own fictitious film, wouldn't you dream big too?The movie itself is all right and has pretty cool script editing, but some scenes are not all that fantastic.

702070,AKVU4HUG6AN1U,B000067D8R,"""chick_flick""","[9, 10]","As usual in the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen films, Mary-Kate and Ashley play two 16-year-old spoiled rich girls who's parents buy them a convertible for their 16th birthday and allows them to take a road trip to Utah for the Winter Olympic games with some friends (both males and females). Along the way, they get into trouble when one of the cars is stolen, and they meet up with some kids who help them. First of all, I can't understand why any parent would give their 16-year-olds a car on their 16th birthdays (OK, maybe some with a lot of money but c'mon, a CONVERTIBLE?!) and then let them take a road trip across country! Maybe if the parents were on dope, but if they were grounded parents, then they should (I hope at least) know better than to do something like that. Also, why on earth were the actors in the film not wearing seat belts? Isn't Hollywood supposed to support the use of their actors wearing seat belts in movies and on TV? For 16-year-olds they should AT LEAST be wearing seat belts! There wasn't much of a unique storyline or plot, and I would've graded this film less but it's the Olsen twins and I don't really want to totally diss their films (I am a fan, after all...don't ask why!). Anyway, the acting is okay, especially by the Olsen twins, but you can't really relate to any of the characters. One of the things that I don't like about the Olsen twins' films is that they always play characters who just like to shop, gossip, and talk on the phone. And then they end up getting to go someplace like London or Australia where they meet cute boys and fall in love and everything has a happy ending.&quot;Getting There&quot; was a disappointing film.

In celebration of their rite of passage the girls and a group of friends embark on a road trip to Salt Lake City to catch the 2002 Winter Olympics.  Who would have thought that getting to Salt Lake city would have been so hard though as problem after problem besets the beleaguered group of friends...THE ANALYSIS:Overall, like most Mary-Kate and Ashley movies the plot is perfectly harmless and entertaining.  The movie should appeal as a great, clean, kids/family movie.  The MANY comical misadventures of the group as they head to Salt Lake are amusing at worse and hilarious at best.THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:This DVD is actually chocked full of goodies.  Included in the DVD special features are:1. One alternate ending to the movie:  SPretty funny.2. Behind the Scenes mini-feature:  6 minute feature where the cast and crew (primarily the twins) talk about the movie and how their experiences filming it.3.  ""Getting There"" Trivia Quiz:  Test your knowledge about the movie!!!4. Party Planning Tips for Your Sweet 16 Birthday Party:  The twins offer their tips on how to make your Sweet 16 the best, even if you are on a budget.  Pretty good and sound advice actually...5. Trailers:  The Multi-million dollar Olsen marketing machine was in full force here!!!  The twins shill the following from their extensive product line:a. Their DVD/Video Catalog:  including ""Holiday in the Sun,"" ""Winning London,"" ""Passport to Paris,"" and ""Our Lips Are Sealed.""b. The ""Getting There"" soundtrack.c. Their ""Girls Night Out"" video game for the Next Gen systems.d. Their ""So Little Time"" tv series action dolls.e. The ""Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action"" cartoon series on ABC.f. Their website ... where you can get all the latest information!!!THE VERDICT:In all, overselling in the DVD features aside, the movie was decent for a ""lazy afternoon"" viewing.

Since then, I forgot them, until &quot;Two Of A Kind&quot; arrived here, and I was a fan once again. But to fill the gap, I watched some of their movies, and it's not a big deal. In fact, it seems like they are all made by a formula, and if you've seen one, you've seen them all. It's clear that the goal of whoever writes their movies is to make as much money as possible, and since the name of the twins alone is a money-machine, they don't really care about making the plot interesting or watch-worthy.I don't say it because I hate the Olsens, I say it because I am a fan. I think the girls have talent, though they do need to work on it a bit, and it's a shame that they're stuck in making silly movies that are only made to sell.If the girls don't want to stay child-actresses for their whole life, and maybe some day be serious actresses, they should draw the line and start making more serious movies.

They get lost about nine times by taking the wrong Greyhound bus, leaving their topless car in the parking lot with the keys in the car, and a lot of other stuff. If I got lost in the middle of the country, my parents would grab me up in no time! Overall, I liked it and it was a little more mature than their previous films. Another thing: How can a sixteen-year-old use their parents' credit card without the parent being around??",4,Surprise!,1035504000,"10 25, 2002",2002,787,"['have', 'admired', 'how', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'have', 'developed', 'such', 'great', 'actresses', 'Now', 'movie', 'Taylor', 'Mary-Kate', 'Kylie', 'Ashley', 'Hunter', 'celebrate', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'new', 'car', 'driver', 'license', 'trip', '2002', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'travel', 'friends', 'theirs', 'when', 'unrealistic', 'get', 'lost', 'about', 'nine', 'times', 'taking', 'wrong', 'Greyhound', 'bus', 'leaving', 'topless', 'car', 'parking', 'lot', 'keys', 'car', 'lot', 'other', 'stuff', 'got', 'lost', 'middle', 'country', 'parents', 'would', 'grab', 'up', 'time', 'Overall', 'liked', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'mature', 'previous', 'films', 'thing', 'How', 'can', 'sixteen-year-old', 'use', 'parents', 'credit', 'card', 'parent', 'being']",N/A

I couldn't get enough of all the horrible things that happen. Not that I would like that to happen in real life, but atleast things don't go perfect like they usually do in their other movies. I also thought some parts were kind of funny. Its totally different then their older movies, Which I like instead of seeing the same old boring plot. Its about where Mary-Kate and Ashley and their friends are wanting to go to the olympics but on their way... However I have to admit it was a little predictable. I mean come on who gets a mustang for their b-day and then go on a great trip to see the olympics with their friends. If you ask me they seem like spoiled little brats to me. Every seen in all their movies they look the best they could be. Have some movie where they just woke out of bed with their hair all messy or something so they don't always look perfect. Try to do things more realistic. I love the twins and I have bean a fan for quite some time but they just seem spoiled. I did like this movie because they didn't end up with boyfriends. It is a little different from their other movies. But if I were them I would try to get into the big movies.",4,Finally Something Different!,1024963200,"06 25, 2002",2002,1265,"['Finally', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'instead', 'chasing', 'guys', 'movie', 'awesome', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'horrible', 'things', 'happen', 'Not', 'would', 'like', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'atleast', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'perfect', 'usually', 'do', 'other', 'movies', 'also', 'thought', 'parts', 'were', 'kind', 'funny', 'totally', 'different', 'then', 'older', 'movies', 'Which', 'like', 'instead', 'seeing', 'same', 'old', 'boring', 'plot', 'where', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'friends', 'are', 'wanting', 'go', 'olympics', 'way', 'However', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'little', 'predictable', 'mean', 'come', 'who', 'mustang', 'b-day', 'then', 'go', 'great', 'trip', 'see', 'olympics', 'friends', 'ask', 'seem', 'spoiled', 'little', 'brats', 'seen', 'movies', 'look', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'Have', 'movie', 'where', 'just', 'woke', 'bed', 'hair', 'messy', 'something', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'look', 'perfect', 'Try', 'do', 'things', 'more', 'realistic', 'love', 'twins', 'have', 'bean', 'fan', 'quite', 'time', 'just', 'seem', 'spoiled', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'boyfriends', 'little', 'different', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'would', 'try', 'get', 'big', 'movies']",N/A
