It focuses much more on meditation, which is great when you're in the mood for that. I feel like I am totally able to let go and dump all the negative energy and (...) I am carrying around after doing this.If you have a bad back, you might want to be careful with the spinal twists.

702014,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000067D1B,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[27, 27]","When I first tried this video, I didn't know what to expect; my only previous experience with Rod Stryker was in the Kathy Smith yoga series, which I did not like.  But to my pleasant surprise, I found that Rod teaches in a relaxed, easy-going style that was a perfect fit for me.  The DVD actually contains two practices, each just under 30 minutes, that can be performed either separately or combined for a longer practice (this format as well as the general feel of the practice is very similar to Kripalu Yoga Gentle).  Rod and a student, Ingrid, perform the practice in a pretty mountaintop field area overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  Rod instructs via voiceover, and Ingrid frequently displays modifications of the poses.  In general, Rod performs several flowing repetitions of each posture followed by a longer hold, which gave the practice a viniyoga feel to me.The first practice, which is about 28 minutes long, begins in a reclined position with a focus on breathing.  Some simple stretches follow, including knee-to-chest, revolved stomach pose, cat/cow, and a kneeling shoulder stretch.  Rod continues with a few more stretches in a standing position:  standing forward bend, arm circles, and a neck stretch.  He then moves into a standing pose series, returning to mountain pose for stabililty between each standing posture.  The poses consisted of triangle, warrior 1, a wide-legged down dog/standing forward bend combination, and modified revolved triangle.  He then returns to the floor for additional cat/cow stretches, down dog, a rest in child pose, and then final relaxation.  During the relaxation, which lasts for several minutes, Rod asks you to meditate on the number 12 and then slowly count backward, with each number bringing you closer to perfection.You can either stop your practice at this point or continue with the second practice, which flows right into bridge pose.  Next, he moves into a lying face-down position for some back extension work and then back to a reclined position for hand-to-foot pose, lying twist, and reclined bound angle.  Transitioning to a seated postion, you'll perform a seated forward bend, bound angle, and then move into relaxation pose.  This time, Rod asks you to visualize various parts of your body smiling, eventually moving to imagining your entire body smiling; I found these visualizations to be beneficial.  The relaxation again lasts for several minutes, and then the final six minutes of this practice is devoted to pranayama (breathing) and seated meditation.  From a seated position, you will first perform a variation on alternate nostril breathing and then spend several minutes just sitting quietly, bringing the total time for the second practice in at about 26.5 minutes.Options on the DVD include selecting chapters, choosing to perform the practice from the modified perspective, and an interview/biography of Rod.  I enjoyed Rod's gentle teaching style, and even though I was already very familiar with all of the poses included in this video, I found his alignment reminders to be helpful.  All of the postures on this DVD would be accessible to beginners (although prior familiarity with the poses would be helpful), but I think that all levels of yoga practitioners will find something to like in this soothing, relaxing practice.",5,"Really enjoyed this relaxing, gentle yoga practice!",1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,3316,"['When', 'first', 'tried', 'video', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'only', 'previous', 'experience', 'Rod', 'Stryker', 'was', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'yoga', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'found', 'Rod', 'teaches', 'relaxed', 'easy-going', 'style', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'DVD', 'actually', 'two', 'practices', 'just', '30', 'minutes', 'can', 'be', 'performed', 'separately', 'combined', 'longer', 'practice', 'format', 'as', 'well', 'general', 'feel', 'practice', 'very', 'similar', 'Kripalu', 'Yoga', 'Gentle', 'Rod', 'student', 'Ingrid', 'perform', 'practice', 'pretty', 'mountaintop', 'field', 'area', 'overlooking', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'Rod', 'voiceover', 'Ingrid', 'frequently', 'modifications', 'poses', 'general', 'Rod', 'several', 'flowing', 'repetitions', 'posture', 'followed', 'longer', 'hold', 'gave', 'practice', 'viniyoga', 'feel', 'me.The', 'first', 'practice', '28', 'minutes', 'long', 'reclined', 'position', 'focus', 'breathing', 'simple', 'stretches', 'follow', 'including', 'knee-to-chest', 'revolved', 'stomach', 'pose', 'cat/cow', 'kneeling', 'shoulder', 'stretch', 'Rod', 'few', 'more', 'stretches', 'standing', 'position', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'arm', 'circles', 'neck', 'stretch', 'then', 'standing', 'pose', 'series', 'returning', 'mountain', 'pose', 'stabililty', 'standing', 'posture', 'poses', 'consisted', 'triangle', 'warrior', '1', 'wide-legged', 'down', 'dog/standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'combination', 'modified', 'revolved', 'triangle', 'then', 'floor', 'additional', 'cat/cow', 'stretches', 'down', 'dog', 'rest', 'child', 'pose', 'then', 'final', 'relaxation', 'relaxation', 'several', 'minutes', 'Rod', 'meditate', 'number', '12', 'then', 'slowly', 'count', 'backward', 'number', 'bringing', 'closer', 'perfection.You', 'can', 'either', 'stop', 'practice', 'point', 'continue', 'second', 'practice', 'right', 'bridge', 'pose', 'Next', 'lying', 'face-down', 'position', 'back', 'extension', 'work', 'then', 'back', 'reclined', 'position', 'hand-to-foot', 'pose', 'lying', 'twist', 'reclined', 'bound', 'angle', 'Transitioning', 'seated', 'postion', ""'ll"", 'perform', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'bound', 'angle', 'then', 'move', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'time', 'Rod', 'visualize', 'various', 'parts', 'body', 'smiling', 'eventually', 'moving', 'imagining', 'entire', 'body', 'smiling', 'found', 'visualizations', 'be', 'beneficial', 'relaxation', 'again', 'several', 'minutes', 'then', 'final', 'six', 'minutes', 'practice', 'devoted', 'pranayama', 'breathing', 'seated', 'meditation', 'seated', 'position', 'will', 'first', 'perform', 'variation', 'alternate', 'nostril', 'breathing', 'then', 'spend', 'several', 'minutes', 'just', 'sitting', 'quietly', 'bringing', 'total', 'time', 'second', 'practice', '26.5', 'minutes.Options', 'DVD', 'include', 'selecting', 'chapters', 'choosing', 'perform', 'practice', 'modified', 'perspective', 'interview/biography', 'Rod', 'enjoyed', 'Rod', 'gentle', 'teaching', 'style', 'even', 'was', 'already', 'very', 'familiar', 'poses', 'included', 'video', 'found', 'alignment', 'reminders', 'be', 'helpful', 'postures', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'accessible', 'beginners', 'prior', 'familiarity', 'poses', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'think', 'levels', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'soothing', 'relaxing', 'practice']",Yoga for Longevity VHS
702015,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B000067D1B,CPTScott,"[28, 28]","I bought this video after reading various reviews about it both in Yoga Journal and on Amazon as well.For the sake of background, I've been a dedicated daily yoga practitioner for over 5 years and have over 40 videos (along with weekly lessons with a wonderful teacher) and was curious to see Rod Stryker's approach to yoga. I've read several articles by him and and about his deep background in Yoga. I'm really pleased with what he presents in this video.This video is unique in many ways. First, Rod Stryker moves at a much more relaxed pace than many videos which makes it much easier to follow. For most (if not all) of the poses he starts with preparatory movements that move you gently into and out of each pose before you hold them for an extended time. This really lets your body ""warm"" into the pose and acclimate to the movement before holding it. This is a really beautiful part of the approach taken here (many of Yoga Zone's videos do this to a certain extent as well and I wouldn't be surprised if that's a result of Mani and Alan Finger's influence on him (Alan Finger is the founder of Yoga Zone and Mani was his Father).Anyway, this is a very thorough, well executed session that has lots of attention to the internal aspects of yoga practice. It also contains a long relaxation segment which then moves into a seated meditation segment.Also, you can do either the first 30 minutes of the tape and stop if you are short on time or you can continue on for the full hour to be able to get into a deeper, more thorough practice.I highly recommend this video to those looking for a gentle but very thorough Yoga practice. I don't know if you'll end up living longer but you'll sure feel better each day of the life that you do have.Namaste.",5,"Wonderful, Gentle yet Thorough Yoga Video",1039219200,"12 7, 2002",2002,1754,"['bought', 'video', 'reading', 'various', 'reviews', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'Amazon', 'well.For', 'sake', 'background', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dedicated', 'daily', 'yoga', 'practitioner', '5', 'years', 'have', 'over', '40', 'videos', 'weekly', 'lessons', 'wonderful', 'teacher', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'Rod', 'Stryker', 'approach', 'yoga', ""'ve"", 'read', 'several', 'articles', 'deep', 'background', 'Yoga', ""'m"", 'really', 'pleased', 'what', 'video.This', 'video', 'unique', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'Rod', 'Stryker', 'much', 'more', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'many', 'videos', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'most', 'not', 'poses', 'preparatory', 'movements', 'move', 'gently', 'pose', 'hold', 'extended', 'time', 'really', 'body', 'warm', 'pose', 'acclimate', 'movement', 'holding', 'really', 'beautiful', 'part', 'approach', 'taken', 'here', 'many', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'videos', 'do', 'certain', 'extent', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'result', 'Mani', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'influence', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'founder', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Mani', 'was', 'Father', '.Anyway', 'very', 'thorough', 'well', 'executed', 'session', 'lots', 'attention', 'internal', 'aspects', 'yoga', 'practice', 'also', 'long', 'relaxation', 'segment', 'then', 'seated', 'meditation', 'segment.Also', 'can', 'do', 'either', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'tape', 'stop', 'are', 'short', 'time', 'can', 'continue', 'full', 'hour', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'deeper', 'more', 'thorough', 'practice.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'looking', 'gentle', 'very', 'thorough', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'living', 'longer', ""'ll"", 'sure', 'feel', 'better', 'day', 'life', 'do', 'have.Namaste']",Yoga for Longevity VHS

This video gives you a great workout, meditative and restorative breaks, and breath training.  This tape has the most positive effect on mind and mood of any tape I have.  It takes approximately an hour to do the entire routine, but there is a convenient break point if you have less time.  This tape has really caused me to appreciate the beauty of the movements, the peace to be found in even brief periods of meditation, and the joy of breathing and living. Stryker has an assistant who demonstrates modified forms of the poses.  Watch the whole tape through once before starting because it is just slightly different than most, and Stryker does not always use the names of the poses in the manner to which I have become accustomed.  It is not, however, difficult to catch on to his directions.",5,Perfect Combination of Exercise and Meditation,1031270400,"09 6, 2002",2002,887,"['am', 'major', 'fan', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'Rod', 'Stryker', 'measures', 'master', 'video', 'great', 'workout', 'meditative', 'restorative', 'breaks', 'breath', 'training', 'tape', 'most', 'positive', 'effect', 'mind', 'mood', 'tape', 'have', 'approximately', 'hour', 'do', 'entire', 'routine', 'convenient', 'break', 'point', 'have', 'less', 'time', 'tape', 'really', 'caused', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'movements', 'peace', 'be', 'found', 'even', 'brief', 'periods', 'meditation', 'joy', 'breathing', 'living', 'Stryker', 'assistant', 'who', 'modified', 'forms', 'poses', 'Watch', 'whole', 'tape', 'once', 'starting', 'just', 'slightly', 'different', 'most', 'Stryker', 'not', 'always', 'use', 'names', 'poses', 'manner', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'not', 'however', 'difficult', 'catch', 'directions']",Yoga for Longevity VHS

The only thing I can add in on the menu, you can either do the main workout which is 1 hour, or choose the 1st or 2nd half only, or you can choose to have the camera focus only on Ingrid doing the modified version. It's just an angle change option even during the workout. If you don't do the meditation, the actual movement part of the workout is 43 min.Dr. Beth did a great job listing all the poses & you can see by how few for 60 min, you can estimate that he slowly moves in/out of each pose & does it 2x half-way before actually doing it. He holds it an moderate nice 40 seconds each when done fully. The pace of the actual movement is nice & slow & could have been good, but I got a bit bored since Rod doesn't talk much or have that many inspiring words, or tell you the benefits of each pose to keep you going.Rod Stryker who speaks very calmly & slowly narrates as a voice over. The music is very light, barely hitting your consciousness, very light, no deep beat which I need. The camera work & production quality is great of course since this is GAIAM.The thing that bothered me the most & main reason I give it 1 less star is I didn't feel the poses flowed with one another, it felt a little like gym stretching, with just getting into basic standing usually in between which I personally don't like. I don't feel he has as much body awareness or peace doing yoga as Rodney Yee, Seane Corn, Shiva Rea, Wai Lana, Teigh McDonough, Yoga for S*x, etc. though he has more then most of the new people or aerobic instructors jumping on the yoga bandwagon. *Cough* Kathy Smith *cough*You can see a preview at Gaiam",4,Slow & relaxed hour-long basic yoga session,1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,1659,"['Dr.', 'Beth', 'Cholette', 'wrote', 'great', 'review', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'add', 'menu', 'can', 'either', 'do', 'main', 'workout', '1', 'hour', 'choose', '1st', '2nd', 'half', 'only', 'can', 'choose', 'have', 'camera', 'only', 'Ingrid', 'doing', 'modified', 'version', 'just', 'angle', 'change', 'option', 'even', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'meditation', 'actual', 'movement', 'part', 'workout', '43', 'min.Dr', 'Beth', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'listing', 'poses', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'few', '60', 'min', 'can', 'estimate', 'slowly', 'in/out', 'pose', '2x', 'half-way', 'before', 'actually', 'doing', 'moderate', 'nice', '40', 'seconds', 'when', 'done', 'fully', 'pace', 'actual', 'movement', 'nice', 'slow', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'got', 'bit', 'bored', 'Rod', ""n't"", 'talk', 'much', 'have', 'many', 'inspiring', 'words', 'tell', 'benefits', 'pose', 'keep', 'going.Rod', 'Stryker', 'who', 'very', 'calmly', 'slowly', 'voice', 'music', 'very', 'light', 'barely', 'hitting', 'consciousness', 'very', 'light', 'deep', 'beat', 'need', 'camera', 'work', 'production', 'quality', 'great', 'course', 'GAIAM.The', 'thing', 'bothered', 'most', 'main', 'reason', 'give', '1', 'less', 'star', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'poses', 'flowed', 'one', 'felt', 'little', 'gym', 'stretching', 'just', 'getting', 'basic', 'standing', 'usually', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'much', 'body', 'awareness', 'peace', 'doing', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Wai', 'Lana', 'Teigh', 'McDonough', 'Yoga', 'S*x', 'etc', 'more', 'then', 'most', 'new', 'people', 'aerobic', 'instructors', 'jumping', 'yoga', 'bandwagon', 'Kathy', 'Smith', '*cough*You', 'can', 'see', 'preview', 'Gaiam']",Yoga for Longevity VHS
