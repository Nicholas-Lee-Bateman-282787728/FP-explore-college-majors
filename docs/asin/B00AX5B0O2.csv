I'm relived to know that Discovery Channel has continued with this successful program. If only they could have done the same for ""Exorcist Diaries"" - another forgotten program that was left in the back-burner!OK. In Season 5 of ""A Haunting"", we get to know of equally terrifying encounters of the spirit world and those human victims who have stumbled across their paths.I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED to know that many of these victims are still left without any positive solutions in most of these unsolved cases! The featured human victims come mainly from the working and middle class and are mostly unbelievers, atheists, skeptics, and some Protestants. Many of them are left hanging in the air without any answers. I wish I can shake them ALL and let them know that there ARE positive solutions to their plight! LOL! As I poured through each of their cases, I already know what to so and where to go and how to go about solving EVERY CASE! Yet, those victims kept looking at all the wrong places for their answers! What a faithless culture America has degenerated into! Why would they approach all those silly and USELESS agnostic ""paranormal research societies""?!!!! Can their EMF metres and video cameras chase away supernatural entities? They all a bunch of silly JOKERS pretending to help those victims! They're all a bunch of useless FOOLS!We're dealing with the supernatural world here, not one you can place in a bottle and study under a microscope with all your technological gadgetry! The answers you get from those ""helpful"" pretenders goes something like that unhelpful woman in Episode 6: ""OK, we got a EVP on tape, we've confirmed that the phenomena you're experiencing is of supernatural origin, but sorry, we can't help you get rid of it!"" ROFLMAO!!!!! That family then approached their Protestant pastor whose prayers are equally useless and ineffective! LOL! I already know the answers to their case 15 mins into hearing their tale.If the producers of this series are responsible enough to help those victims, they should call for a Traditional Catholic priest who knows about these things and who is more effective than his Modernist / Liberal counterparts. A Traditional Catholic Exorcist is called only as a last resort in the most difficult cases. 97% of the time, a Traditional Catholic priest with the relevant training would suffice. Ignore those Liberal Catholic priests who fill the ranks of the modern mainstream dioceses, their lack of faith is detrimental to the Work. Get the Traditional Catholic priest to do more than just a simple blessing. A simple blessing isn't effective enough for the victims featured in this ""A Haunting"" series.In the case studies featured in ""A Haunting"", we see many haunted houses, so we've to work on the houses, their respective histories in relation to the histories of previous occupants (eg. any previous deaths, murders, suicides, devil worship in the houses, Native Indian burial grounds, etc.). Determine if the source of the haunting is human or inhuman, or both. You'll want a series of rounds of blessings and banishments customised for that specific type of haunting. Here's a TIP: people think that they can call a priest for help, expect a wand to be waved and things would get back to a state they expect. You think you're treating a bout of flu? Pop a pill and hope to get well the next day or week? In reality, the real world doesn't work that way! If the victims, or someone closely connected to them, are living in MORTAL SIN and living unhealthy (read: sinful) lifestyles, then they should work on cleansing THEMSELVES, as much as they seek help in cleansing their surroundings!A VERY EFFECTIVE SOLUTION:Roman Ritual (Christian Burial and Office for the Dead, Exorcism, Blessings Reserved to Religious or to Certain Places, Volume 2)Recommended reading:Beware the NightThe Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine WarrenThe ExorcistHostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary AmericansRecommended viewing:A Haunting - Seasons 1-4The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)The Exorcism of Emily Rose (Unrated Special Edition)",5,> Keep This Exciting Series Alive!

In the older seasons you'd see the actors preform actions but when they talked it was low and the narrator talked over them so they could basically get anyone to be in the show and it wohld look good.  In this season they chucked that brilliant idea out the window and decided to let these people try to act it out.  Seasons 1-4 I could binge on, watching episode after episode but these I can just stomach one at a time.One other problem is the earlier seasons were well known ghost stories for the most part with fresh stuff peppered in but none of these were note worthy.  That would have been alright, it was mainly the acting that killed these for me.",2,Not as good as season 1-4 but still watchable.,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,718,"['other', 'reviews', 'said', 'horrible', 'acting', 'killed', 'show', 'older', 'seasons', ""'d"", 'see', 'actors', 'preform', 'actions', 'when', 'talked', 'was', 'low', 'narrator', 'talked', 'so', 'could', 'basically', 'get', 'anyone', 'be', 'show', 'wohld', 'look', 'good', 'season', 'chucked', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'window', 'decided', 'let', 'people', 'try', 'act', 'out', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'could', 'binge', 'watching', 'episode', 'episode', 'can', 'just', 'stomach', 'one', 'time.One', 'other', 'problem', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'were', 'well', 'known', 'ghost', 'stories', 'most', 'part', 'fresh', 'stuff', 'peppered', 'none', 'were', 'note', 'worthy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'alright', 'was', 'mainly', 'acting', 'killed']",A Haunting - Season 5
