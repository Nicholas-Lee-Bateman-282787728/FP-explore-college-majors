1251484,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B0026IQTO0,AIROLF,"[0, 1]","Simply put, ""Shadowheart"" is an atrocious film. Although it's not as bad as some of the other films I've seen, ""Shadowheart"" is poorly written, badly acted, and historically inaccurate.What kept bothering me throughout the movie wasn't the fact that this Western wasn't actually set in a correct era, it was the fact that no one in this film speaks as if they were in the 19th century New Mexico. The dialogue, as well as the accent, are modern-day. The music, the sets, the costumes - everything rarely has a feel of the olden era about it.All in all, it's almost as if someone read the Cliff Notes as to how to behave in a Western and made it into a film.Perhaps in his first film debut, Dean Alioto shouldn't have overextended himself by trying to be a triple threat (writer-director-actor); he should've focused on one area. He needed to have concentrated more on honing his script to include character development and realistic dialogue, directing his actors, and doing something besides looking moody and mysterious as a supporting character, Spider. Alioto attempts to project his inner Sam Elliott in the film and comes up quite short.Furthermore, it's unclear why Alioto needed 114 minutes to tell the most basic of all stories and why he needed to use every minute of film to drag out the most basic of plots. The plot begins with the murder of James Conners (Justin Ament), the preacher of the town of Legend, New Mexico. Conners runs away, fights through the Civil War, comes back to get the girl of his dreams, decides not to avenge his father's death and realizes how wrong he's been about ""turning the other cheek.""A film that could've dealt with Conners' inner turmoil and the questions of forgiveness and religious beliefs vs reality, ""Shadownheart"" barely even hints at these themes and provided no others for the viewer to contemplate.The only possible highlight of this film is Angus Macfadyen. Macfadyen plays Will Tunney - the film's villain - a murderer, philanderer, and a business tycoon. Tunney is a character that's a lot more promising than the purported hero of this film. However, Macfadeyen has very little to work with in terms of script and is thus unable to carry this movie.The cover for the DVD for ""Shadowheart"" claims that this is ""The best movie sinceTombstone."" The only way that this can be the case is if the person providing such feedback (Peter Sherayko, who is a ""Western historian"" according to the DVD cover) has not seen any other Westerns since ""Tombstone."" To even draw comparisons between ""Tombstone"" and ""Shadowheart"" is to think excessively low of the former and optimistically high of the latter.Even though I never push my opinion of a movie on others (realizing that everyone has different taste), I must recommend against watching this film.",1,do not waste your time on this film,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,2798,"['Simply', 'put', 'Shadowheart', 'atrocious', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Shadowheart', 'poorly', 'written', 'badly', 'acted', 'historically', 'inaccurate.What', 'kept', 'bothering', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Western', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'set', 'correct', 'era', 'was', 'fact', 'one', 'film', 'were', '19th', 'century', 'New', 'Mexico', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'accent', 'are', 'modern-day', 'music', 'sets', 'costumes', 'everything', 'rarely', 'feel', 'olden', 'era', 'it.All', 'almost', 'someone', 'read', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'how', 'behave', 'Western', 'made', 'film.Perhaps', 'first', 'film', 'debut', 'Dean', 'Alioto', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'overextended', 'trying', 'be', 'triple', 'threat', 'writer-director-actor', 'should', ""'ve"", 'focused', 'one', 'area', 'needed', 'have', 'concentrated', 'more', 'honing', 'script', 'include', 'character', 'development', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'directing', 'actors', 'doing', 'something', 'looking', 'moody', 'mysterious', 'supporting', 'character', 'Spider', 'Alioto', 'project', 'inner', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'film', 'up', 'quite', 'short.Furthermore', 'unclear', 'why', 'Alioto', 'needed', '114', 'minutes', 'tell', 'most', 'basic', 'stories', 'why', 'needed', 'use', 'minute', 'film', 'drag', 'out', 'most', 'basic', 'plots', 'plot', 'murder', 'James', 'Conners', 'Justin', 'Ament', 'preacher', 'town', 'Legend', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Conners', 'away', 'fights', 'Civil', 'War', 'back', 'get', 'girl', 'dreams', 'not', 'avenge', 'father', 'death', 'realizes', 'how', 'wrong', 'been', 'turning', 'other', 'cheek', 'A', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'dealt', 'Conners', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'questions', 'forgiveness', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'vs', 'reality', 'Shadownheart', 'barely', 'even', 'hints', 'themes', 'provided', 'others', 'viewer', 'contemplate.The', 'only', 'possible', 'highlight', 'film', 'Angus', 'Macfadyen', 'Macfadyen', 'plays', 'Will', 'Tunney', 'film', 'villain', 'murderer', 'philanderer', 'business', 'tycoon', 'Tunney', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'promising', 'purported', 'hero', 'film', 'However', 'Macfadeyen', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'terms', 'script', 'thus', 'unable', 'carry', 'movie.The', 'cover', 'DVD', 'Shadowheart', 'best', 'movie', 'sinceTombstone', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'case', 'person', 'providing', 'such', 'feedback', 'Peter', 'Sherayko', 'who', 'Western', 'historian', 'according', 'DVD', 'cover', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'Westerns', 'Tombstone', 'even', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'Tombstone', 'Shadowheart', 'think', 'excessively', 'low', 'former', 'optimistically', 'high', 'latter.Even', 'never', 'push', 'opinion', 'movie', 'others', 'realizing', 'everyone', 'different', 'taste', 'must', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film']",Shadowheart
1251485,A3MFORLOKIOEQY,B0026IQTO0,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I find this movie to be very well crafted, with good photography, story, and acting.Technical Details: Widescreen, Dolby Surround 5.1, R rated for violence (there is no nudity), with English subtitles available (for hearing impaired). The only extras are a short ""behind the scenes"" and the trailer.This movie is about a man who returns to his small town in New Mexico to find revenge for his father's murder. It is set in the period just before and after the Civil War. The story is somewhat dark, as is perhaps appropriate for a movie called ""Shadowheart"". Westerns have traditionally been about good and evil (and good always wins), but this one is a more modern theme - it could have been set in any age or time. The fact that it works very well in this period piece is a testament to the writer and directors. The writers manage to give a good experience of how the west actually was, rather than succumbing to Hollywood stereotypes. The movie has a lot of depth because of the script.There are no bad actors in this film, which is nice to see in an independent production. I think that the best character was the villain; he was thoroughly evil, and yet was also pitiful. One got the impression that he was evil but at the same time tired of life. The acting for this character was really great. The lead character was also quite good, showing the conflicts he felt about his mission of revenge versus his inner feelings that he had simply seen too much violence. The other characters were well acted, but did not have as much script material to work with.Photography is focused on the action, and in general very well done. They do not use screen time on expansive scenery, which is done a lot in westerns (but would have detracted from the dark plot). I thought the filming supported the movie well.The only negative in the entire movie was that I felt the Native American involvement did not quite come through as well as I would have liked. There was not enough time in the script to develop their characters, and I found their actions in helping the main character to be a bit, well, sudden.Summary: A bit depressing, but a very thoughtful movie.

There are some scenes that remind one of classic wersterns, almost a tribute to them. This is an old story. Boy returns as a man to avenge his father's death. It is fairly implausible that a young boy could travel over a thousand miles to family after his father's death, especially with all the dangers of a pre civil war country.(And back, fifteen years later) I have read all of Larry Mc Murtry's sagas that almost scare one away from camping for heaven's sake. And Will Henry, that author makes the hundred years war seem a picnic in comparison. But this story has young love, the most miserable villian imaginable and a really great supporting cast of classic western actors that I enjoyed seeing. I hope this crew gets together again for another western with a more unique story. This was well done but it became a tad preachy in parts, remembering his father the slain minister.

1251491,A1BEKAQQGP8CMF,B0026IQTO0,Big Red,"[2, 2]","Shadowheart is not your typical western and I have mixed feelings about it. If I want a true western I think I'll turn to Eastwood. Allow me to split my thoughts into pros and cons...There are several things I don't like about Shadowheart. First of all, the movie doesn't exactly reflect the title. I think in the first minute the narration says something along the lines of ""I refer to him as Shadowheart"" and that's all we hear of that. You can forget about it and might as well make up your own title. I would call it Legend, which is where this takes place, a town in New Mexico set in 1865. Secondly, the beginning of the movie is boring and the child acting is borderline laughable. Obviously not all children are stars, but the acting just isn't good. Thirdly, the very end did not seem necessary. I won't say much so as not to spoil everything, but if it ended showing the yellow ribbon and nothing afterward I would have been happier. That would have been a great way to finish. Watch and you'll know exactly what I mean.Now on to what I do like about Shadowheart. First of all, poor acting aside, this is a solid story. I enjoyed it despite dealing with the aforementioned cons. James Conners loses his father to murder as a child, he leaves town and returns an adult seeking vengeance. Would I recommend it as a western to see? No. Would I recommend it as a movie to see? Maybe. Secondly, Will Tunney is a fantastic character. He's the slimy guy everyone's afraid to mess with and he ultimately owns the town. Nobody likes him, likely even his own crew.

Not even close. First off, let me explain the title of my review. Now I don't mean by saying that this movie is geared toward octogenarians/80 year olds as an insult. What I mean is this is the type of western made by Roy Rodgers and John Wayne back in the 50s and even 40s. They are pretty dry for the most part and look like they are shot in the hills behind the Hollywood sign. Nothing fancy in those oldies and nothing fancy here. The main building in the movie, a church, looks like a large version of a tool shed.  What drew me to this movie was the mention of the Civil War and it had a 2 minute Civil War scene that must have put them back [...] bucks to shoot. Another reason I wanted to see this move is because there haven't been many westerns made recently but surprisingly the ones getting the most publicity have been pretty good. Shadowhart is not.Westerns started having much more of an edge in the 60s. Bad guys starting being really bad. The main bad guy in Shadowheart is annoying. Heck I wanted to shoot him 20 minutes into the movie just to shut up his bad dialog and mannerisms.  The story was very predictable. The acting was mixed, some were a little better then others, but overall what you would expect from a low budget indie or made for TV movies. When I am watching a western and thinking to myself that the women are out acting the men, Houston, you have a problem. Great films are the ones you want to watch over and over.

1251493,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0026IQTO0,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 4]","Being a proud member of Amazon.com's Vine reviewers, I found myself pondering why some movies were available on occasion (usually ones I've never heard of), while others were not. I also consider myself a responsible reviewer; in other words, I'll read, sample, or watch whatever it is I get from Amazon's Vine program, regardless of what it looks like on the outside. Unfortunately, a pattern is emerging for The Vine program films. These are the seldom heard of ones I mentioned earlier. To give you an idea as to what types of films are being offered through The Vine, I'll use this one -- SHADOWHEART -- as an example.First, let's take into consideration the fact that the film was produced by first-time film production company Desert Moon Pictures. Okay. So. Big deal. Now let's look at the main actor, Justin Ament. His film repertoire is not exactly stellar. He's had a lot of uncredited work (see ""extra""), obviously trying to break into Hollywood's mainstream. He's written two screenplays: this one, and another forThe Path of Evil. The Path of Evil, like Shadowheart, hasn't been lauded as very good cinema. But why?Well, the easy answer is that the films just aren't that well thought-out nor well put together. In Shadowheart, we see cliche after cliche, and old character after old character. It's a recycle mish-mash of seriously poor proportions. Think of just about every Italian western starring Clint Eastwood and you'll have seen every character in this film many times over.The only exception to the poor characters is Angus Macfadyen (best known for his role as Robert the Bruce inBraveheart) as the wicked -- but still cliche stereotype -- Will Tunney. He played (perhaps overplayed) the role of the ruthless and amoral killer and made it, at the very least, fun to watch.Everything else in this story was completely predictable.

I liked the story overall, set in early west New Mexico, pre/post Civil War, where a young boy leaves a gritty growing town only to return to deal with his angst from his childhood and to cleanse himself from his difficulties he went through during the Civil War.The movie itself is a little slow paced, yet the story itself is engaging with a few glimpses into some great potential. The actors do a great job in their parts.  You will recognize a few of them.  Telling is the work of Angus MacFadyen (who played Robert the Bruce in Braveheart).  He is the bad guy in the movie, and you really get this gut wrenching feeling about the character, so he really does a great job.  Frankly, we get the bad guys always looking smart or clean, but this guy is just an ugly mess.  Great performance.The movie is soft on language and not much if any gore.  Although the violence is not completely off screen, there is no spurting blood everywhere when someone gets shot, so at least, you are more into the story than the gore.Justin Ament is fairly new to me, so I was impressed with his acting, very serious brooding character who has flashes of insight on where he needs to be as a person.I liked this movie and rated it a 4 for overall, yet the story line itself would be a 5.  It made me feel a little like Unforgiven as far as the feel of the screen work.  It could have used a little more on the wide view or panorama view to get a larger feel.  I think it would make a great TV pilot and would make a good TV show  like Lonesome Dove.The only negative I felt that there were too many lines to follow, his childhood, the Civil War, the run in with the Indians, the train and the bad guy.

The movie wanted to be good, the director tried, but too much of the film seemed cobbled together and not smoothly finessed. Film students in high school could have done better. In no particular order, here are things that marred the production and truly bothered me:1. Opening: What does an Indian dance have to do with this film? A reason for its inclusion could be stretched, but mostly it's cobbled.2. The biggest blunder comes with Will Tunney, movie's bad guy--gambler, womanizer, cheat, dissolute and immoral--played wonderfully by Angus MacFadden, although a bit over the top. What is the blunder? In his first scene he has rotten nubs for teeth. A few years later he has perfect teeth, obviously not ""false."" But yes, false, in that they are not false (which he carefully picks clean in public--I wanted to gag every time).Note: I intentionally wrote #2 vague to show how vague was the non-explanation for the miraculous improvement of his teeth. The seeming moral here is that, if you take other people's land, your teeth will improve?3. Time jumps. The most disturbing comes when James meets the two Navajos, brother and sister, on their forced march to New Mexico. He slips them a knife to free themselves, yet the story line later reveals that they escaped from the reservation where they learned really good English. The viewer is given no information about a time jump. So how the discrepancy? This is major.4. The insertion of a Navajo woman who has become a Bible-reading Christian. She is shown receiving that Bible, then in a short period learns how to read it. How? She is the Christian witness in the movie and would have been very effective had the time problem been explained. But no, it's just a throw-in.5. Shave off a man's big thick mustache and he becomes a new man. Maybe.6. **SPOILER ALERT**NUMBERS 6-8 CONTAIN SPOILERS. READ NO FURTHER!This is my own personal objection to plot development. It very well could have happened.The marriage is not consummated!! Yes, good for moving the story forward, but oh so disappointing!! I object!!7. When the bad guys beat up and shoot James, he just looks roughed up, not beaten to a pulp. The shooter is a ferocious, scary killer, yet his shot lands in that little sunken space between the breast bone and the shoulder. A big blunder!8. James is shot repeatedly yet has the strength to get back to Mary's grave to die. Strains credulity!9. Even though James kills in revenge and hatred, he still goes to heaven.

1251504,AAPPWNP9FWVWS,B0026IQTO0,"Kathlyn Storey ""Kathlyn A Storey""","[11, 14]","My husband I watched this movie last night.  I don't ""book review"" movies because that information can be found in other reviews and the product description.  We love westerns, have watched them for over 50 years, and have a great respect for the older, and more recent, great ones in the genre, such as Shane, High Noon, Gunfight at the OK Corral, Unforgiven, Open Range, among others.  Shadowheart cannot be mentioned in the same sentence with great westerns.  My husband gave it 1  stars; I had to give it one star because 0 stars cannot be posted.  Here is why:The first 10 minutes of the movie lays out the plot, which does catch your attention.  Unfortunately, after the initial promise, from then on everything goes straight downhill, whether it is the story (predictable), dialogue (leaves a lot to be desired), acting (fair to poor), or directing (out to lunch).  I personally didn't think it was possible to muddle the themes of revenge and redemption; however, this movie does a fairly good job of it.The movie is relentlessly depressing.  It starts out badly, and from there, it just gets worse.  In that respect only, it strongly reminded me of an excellent 1967 movie called Welcome to Hard Times.  Otherwise, there is nothing about Shadowheart, the title being explained in a completely confusing way, that is funny, entertaining, uplifting, or fathomable, for that matter.

From this, Shadowheart sounds very promising. As other reivewers correctly note, however, the film falls far, far from its description. The story is slow going (taking about 30 wandering minutes to really take shape), and the meeting of this Native American tribe (of two Native Americans) is, at best, a wandering side plot to a wandering main plot.THE BEST: If there is anything that brings Shadowheart to life, it is the wonderful acting by Angus MacFayden (Saw V, Californication) who portrays an absolutely WONDERFUL villian in the murderous mayor Will Tunney. MacFayden undoes at least a little bit of the damage done by the overall stiff acting and awkward dialogue (""Dead or alive? I prefer...dead!"") It is not exaggeration to say that if MacFayden hadn't been cast in the role he was, I'd have given the film two less stars.THE WORST: What really killed this film is the very wandering plot (guy sees his father die, fights in the civil war, comes back to hometown, gets married, attempts to lock up fathers killder...).

But after ""Unforgiven,"" the modern Western had the bar raised as high as an elephant's eye.Give the movie credit. It starts with that most classic and elemental hero's desire: revenge. James Conners sees his father (the wonderful actor William Sadler, who the director praises in the audio commentary), a town preacher, murdered by Will Tunney, the psychotic land baron who chews up the scenery and injects vulnerability into the role of the antagonist. Conners leaves town, returns after a stint in the Civil War, reconnects with his sweetheart Mary Cooper, and sets out to avenge his father's death, even though his father told him to leave justice to God.

1251510,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0026IQTO0,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 3]","Dean Alioto cast himself as the gunman Spider & also directed.  He was interesting as the assassin who kills for the bad guy Will Tunney.  Angus Macfadyen plays the bad guy with relish.  He does a very good job, although Alioto does him no favors with several over-the-top moments where it's hard to tell whether he's playing comedy like ""L.A. Dicks"" which Alioto also directed or a seriously evil man.  The dialogue and characterization tends to make Tunney ridiculous rather than callous as when he checks his hair in his pocket watch rather than attend to a mayoral meeting.  Add to this the sorely limited acting of Justin Ament who handles the grief of his wife's loss with sad puppy dog eyes, not even nearing the level of intensity needed to motivate the final scene.  The two actors playing American Indians, Michael Spears as Washakie and Tonantzin Carmelo as Miakoda, do well in the film, except for brief melodramatic touches by Carmelo.  Marnie Alton as Mary Cooper does an excellent job in her appearance as the bride.  Ines Dali is also quite impressive as Velma, the lady of the evening who somehow has a crush on the evil Tunney.  Shawn Reeves also turns in a good performance as Johny Cooper, Mary's brother the stable keeper.  Unfortunately, the script doesn't hang together very well.  I believe this film was intended to appeal to a Christian audience because of its philosophic emphasis on nonviolence.  However, it winds up portraying Christians as weak people who would rather allow their families to be killed rather than stand up to evil.  While I sympathized with the intent, the execution irked me.  William Sadler did a nice cameo as the preacher.  I stopped this film several times not wanting to watch more.

1251511,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0026IQTO0,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[0, 0]","Shadowheart came out in 2009 and was set in the years of the civil war. Despite its intro scene which features a Navaho dancer, and the marketing push which states that there's a lot of Native American aspects to the movie, it is primarily about a white couple. We begin with the boy and girl in love in the town of Legend, New Mexico. The music seems almost lifted directly from Lord of the Rings scenes of the Shire. After the boy's father is slain he runs off, experiences the horrors of war, then returns home to make things right. Much of the movie is fairly stereotypical complete with slick-back-hair bad guy and his sneaky sidekick.The funniest part of the entire movie has to be the existence of Vampire People in Legend. I watched this movie twice, two years apart, and each time I burst out laughing when I saw their evidence. But we'll get to that in a minute.The movie promotes heavily its native American layers - and indeed the title Shadowheart refers to how dark the hero feels. However, there are only random glimpses of native Americans here. First, as Shadowheart is bounty hunting after his civil war stint, he runs into a small group of Navaho who have been rousted from their home in Tsegi, Arizona and are being brought to live on a reservation. He gives a knife to two of them so they can escape. This brother and sister pair are played by Michael Spears and Tonantzin Carmelo. Michael is Sioux. He played ""Otter"" in Dances with Wolves. Tonantzin is half Tongva / Kumeyaay - tribes of southern California. The movie was filmed in California, too. Maybe I'm too picky, but it always bothers me when they film something that is all about a ""place"" with certain ""people"" and then neither are accurate.Back to the story. There is of course conflict between the good guys and bad guys, and the two Navajo have to come in and help out. I won't give away any spoilers, but the movie is certainly not focused on the native American aspect of things, which the rest of the marketing might lead one to believe. It's primarily an Old West love / revenge story.Now, as to the Vampire People. Or maybe they're zombies. In any case, they are some sort of people who don't age at all despite the passage of ten years. At the beginning of the film, the main lovers are maybe 11 or 12. Young love. As they first get into the town of Legend, a very distinctive pair of women are walking on the street with giant parasols. One parasol is white, the other black. It's hard to miss them. A guy to the left lounges in a fringed shirt with white pants.Then we fast forward to when Shadowheart returns to town after his years of civil war grief and bounty hunting. He strolls back into his home town for the first time in a decade or more. Look! It is the EXACT SAME PEOPLE in the exact same positions standing in the street! What, is this where they stand all the time, waiting for him to see them? They haven't aged a day, they haven't changed their clothes, they are maintaining the same relative position to each other.Spoooooky.In any case, watching this once was not overly exciting, and watching it a second time just reminded me of the silliness from the first time. The saving grace is that I loved the characters of the surveyors. They were minor characters, but so well done. They really came to life. It made me realize as an author that this was something to aim for, to give even minor characters this kind of vitality.",3,Missing its Claimed Native American Roots,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,3434,"['Shadowheart', 'came', 'out', '2009', 'was', 'set', 'years', 'civil', 'war', 'intro', 'scene', 'Navaho', 'dancer', 'marketing', 'push', 'lot', 'Native', 'American', 'aspects', 'movie', 'primarily', 'white', 'couple', 'begin', 'boy', 'girl', 'love', 'town', 'Legend', 'New', 'Mexico', 'music', 'almost', 'lifted', 'directly', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'scenes', 'Shire', 'boy', 'father', 'slain', 'horrors', 'war', 'then', 'home', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'Much', 'movie', 'fairly', 'stereotypical', 'complete', 'slick-back-hair', 'bad', 'guy', 'sneaky', 'sidekick.The', 'funniest', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'be', 'existence', 'Vampire', 'People', 'Legend', 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'two', 'years', 'apart', 'time', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'when', 'saw', 'evidence', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute.The', 'movie', 'heavily', 'native', 'American', 'layers', 'indeed', 'title', 'Shadowheart', 'refers', 'how', 'dark', 'hero', 'feels', 'However', 'are', 'only', 'random', 'glimpses', 'native', 'Americans', 'here', 'First', 'Shadowheart', 'bounty', 'hunting', 'civil', 'war', 'stint', 'small', 'group', 'Navaho', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'rousted', 'home', 'Tsegi', 'Arizona', 'are', 'being', 'brought', 'live', 'reservation', 'knife', 'two', 'can', 'escape', 'brother', 'sister', 'pair', 'are', 'played', 'Michael', 'Spears', 'Tonantzin', 'Carmelo', 'Michael', 'Sioux', 'played', 'Otter', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Tonantzin', 'half', 'Tongva', '/', 'Kumeyaay', 'tribes', 'southern', 'California', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'California', 'too', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'picky', 'always', 'bothers', 'when', 'film', 'something', 'place', 'certain', 'people', 'then', 'are', 'accurate.Back', 'story', 'course', 'conflict', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'two', 'Navajo', 'have', 'come', 'help', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'focused', 'native', 'American', 'aspect', 'things', 'rest', 'marketing', 'might', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'primarily', 'Old', 'West', 'love', '/', 'revenge', 'story.Now', 'Vampire', 'People', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'zombies', 'case', 'are', 'sort', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'age', 'passage', 'ten', 'years', 'beginning', 'film', 'main', 'lovers', 'are', 'maybe', '11', '12', 'Young', 'love', 'first', 'get', 'town', 'Legend', 'very', 'distinctive', 'pair', 'women', 'are', 'walking', 'street', 'giant', 'parasols', 'One', 'parasol', 'white', 'other', 'black', 'hard', 'miss', 'guy', 'left', 'fringed', 'shirt', 'white', 'pants.Then', 'fast', 'forward', 'when', 'Shadowheart', 'town', 'years', 'civil', 'war', 'grief', 'bounty', 'hunting', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'first', 'time', 'decade', 'more', 'Look', 'EXACT', 'SAME', 'PEOPLE', 'exact', 'same', 'positions', 'standing', 'street', 'What', 'where', 'stand', 'time', 'waiting', 'see', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'day', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'clothes', 'are', 'maintaining', 'same', 'relative', 'position', 'other.Spoooooky.In', 'case', 'watching', 'once', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'exciting', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'just', 'reminded', 'silliness', 'first', 'time', 'saving', 'grace', 'loved', 'characters', 'surveyors', 'were', 'minor', 'characters', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'came', 'life', 'made', 'realize', 'author', 'was', 'something', 'aim', 'give', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'kind', 'vitality']",Shadowheart

I won't spoil the film, but as far as that tag-line goes...not really.  And that is my main problem with this film.  It had no idea what it was trying to say.  It leads you in the direction of God and redemption, completely ignores it, and pays you off with...well, I can't say without putting spoilers in the review.  I'll just say, the ending should have been different, considering the actions and words of the characters.  At the same time I was afraid that this would be a movie that over preachy, and it was not.The plot, briefly, is typical Western fare.  A preacher is killed, the son goes off and comes back years later for revenge.Cinematically, this feels like a Halmark or Disney channel made-for-T.V. movie.  Having grown up on the films of Sergio Leone, I have a love of Westerns where you can feel the grit.  Where you can smell the stink coming off the actors on the screen.  In ""Shadowheart"", everyone has perfectly shampooed hair and bright clean clothes.  Even after a fight, characters have perfectly and artistically applied dirt and blood to their clothes.  The most hilarious is the main character's glued on mustache when he returns to town, to let you know he's a ""tough guy"".The writing and acting, for the most part, is fairly dreadful.  The ""bad guys"" are the most hilarious of caricatures.  Black Bart meets Yosemite Sam.  The Navajo are portrayed as both the ""noble savage"" and as the ""magical healers"".  Two stereotypes for the price of one.  The railroad surveyors are hilarious anachronisms.The only saving grace for this movie is that, in spite of its relatively safe PG-13 approach to filming and story, there is a surprising amount of darkness to the film.  This is what actually drew me in to the story and kept me from turning it off after 10 minutes.  Still, given all of countless great westerns that exist, I would put this film way down the list of movies in that genre that should be seen.

Others have described the plot already, I'll just mention some things about the film I liked and didn't like.I liked the bad guy, played by Angus MacFadyen.  This guy was so scuzzy and hateful he made my skin crawl.  Casting did an excellent job there.As others have mentioned, the descrption on the jacket didn't match the film at all.  And I didn't understand how the name Shadowheart came about; I'm not even sure who Shadowheart was.  Therefore I think a better title could have been created.Daniel Baldwin lent his name to this film, yet he has a very small, insignificant part.  (If you have a cameo appearance by a big star, make it a big star.  If your big star is a Baldwin brother, and he only has five lines, it's not very impressive.  His appearance added nothing to the movie.)The movie was predictable; you knew what was going to happen before it happened.  And there were some pretty unrealistic parts, like when the Indian girl rode into town looking for her brother, and when the main character, James, and his brother-n-law should have been sneaking out of town to go find the Marshall of a nearby town, they rode right down Main street so everyone could see them.  That was a seriously stupid move, in my opinion.  Smart cowboys wouldn't have done that.I didn't feel the movie was a complete waste of time.If you really like made-for-TV movies and romances, I'd say give it a shot.

Westerns are by their nature formulaic...they are a genre that hews closely to established turns.  That's why they have often struggled in modern times...it's rare they find an embracing audience because they often feel tired and uninspired, unless crafted with real skill and fervency (I'm thinking of UNFORGIVEN or the 3:10 TO YUMA remake).  This Western, based on a story by its star Justin Ament suffers from a low budget which did not allow the money to hire skillful lead actors, craft a good script or even provide for technical technique that ever rises above mid-level TV movie quality.As a young boy, James Cooper's preacher father is killed by town trouble maker Will Tunney...so James flees his New Mexico  home to head east.  He leaves behind his best friend, a young girl named Mary as well as his shame at not having the nerve to kill the man who murdered his beloved father.  Year later, James returns to his old town a Civil War He arrests veteran who has been hardened by his work as a bounty hunter.  He finds that Will is now mayor and a major landowner, but still a vicious killer.  Things don't work out as easily as James would like, and the movie takes many predictable turns.  Although the body count of ""good"" guys is higher than normal).  It even echoes DANCES WITH WOLVES at times.While little in the film is new, a well done Western can still be engrossing.  Simple passions and clear boundaries between good and evil can make the films satisfying and emotional.  But SHADOWHEART suffers because its lead ""good"" guy (Ament) is not only bland, but downright bad.  He rarely musters up any convincing emotions (and his efforts are not helped by a corny soundtrack that contains a couple of songs so bad as to be laughable).  And as Will Tunney, character actor Angus Macfadyen might just as well be twirling a mustache and typing folks to railroad tracks.  We hate him mostly because he's so unconvincing.The film, set in New Mexico but filmed in California, looks nice and that's virtually its only redeeming quality.  It is violent, but most of the violence is not terribly graphic, which I suppose might make this a good movie for an older audience that yearns for the days of films with no bad language, nudity or overt sexuality or violence.  That's not a knock on that kind of film or audience member.  SHADOWHEART is one of those movies that was probably a labor of love from Ament and director Deann Alioto (who also co-wrote the screenplay and takes on a major supporting role).  I'm not sure how they got the supposed budget of $10,000,000...but I'm guessing they were disappointed with the returns on the investment.I almost hate to criticize this film, because it feels a little like yelling at a group of youth league football players for not being able to beat a college team.  It feels like a movie made by folks eagerly trying to break into the big leagues, even though they don't have the skills.

1251526,A19YOYY7FLQMA6,B0026IQTO0,"Tante Maren ""Maren""","[1, 1]","Shadowheart has the components for the makings of a good western movie, but it falls short in several areas, leaving it at best an average western.The story starts out very promising as the main character James Conners (Justin Ament) as a boy, sees his preacher father killed by the greedy bad guy Will Tunney (Angus Macfayden)in town. Now an orphan, James has a little girlfriend he leaves, Mary (Marnie Alton) and her younger brother, as he says he is going to live in another state with an Aunt and Uncle. The next thing you know James was in the Civil War and suddenly he's a Bounty Hunter.James, naturally wants to go back to his home town of Legend, get even with the bad guy Tunney, who now owns the town with the help of his gang, because the railroad will be going through it, and of course marry his girlfriend Mary. When James is attacked by the bad guy land Baron Tunney and his gang, he is rescued by Indians. Michael Spears from Dances With Wolves plays a great part as the Indian, as does his sister. The biggest problem is, these promising characters are never fully developed.Justin Ament plays a great part as James Conners and so does his girlfriend Mary. The biggest disappointment is in Angus Macfayden's performance of the bad guy land Baron Will Tunney and his gang. Tunney should have been the town's dentist, instead of the bad Baron, as he spends most of his time cleaning and picking his teeth. The gang acted like a bunch of immaturity cases that anybody's grandmother could whip in a minute. That only made it all the more unbelievable that James had such a hard time getting rid of these guys.With the characters not fully developed, the story line missing parts that would have made for a more interesting plot, the movie takes a turn for the worse, when after about 20 minutes into the movie, our whole family could predict what would happen next, including the ending.I am a huge fan of Western movies, especially the classics that featured the great John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. I've been spoiled with really great bad guys like Lee Van Cleef, and I had a hard time believing the bad guys in this movie were really bad. They seemed as though, if someone slapped them in the face, they would cry like babies. What could have been another good Western, ended up being underdeveloped and far too predictable, which is a shadow of a very average movie for me.",3,Shadowheart-A Shadow of a B Western,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,2391,"['Shadowheart', 'components', 'makings', 'good', 'western', 'movie', 'short', 'several', 'areas', 'leaving', 'best', 'average', 'western.The', 'story', 'out', 'very', 'promising', 'main', 'character', 'James', 'Conners', 'Justin', 'Ament', 'boy', 'preacher', 'father', 'killed', 'greedy', 'bad', 'guy', 'Will', 'Tunney', 'Angus', 'Macfayden', 'town', 'Now', 'orphan', 'James', 'little', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'Marnie', 'Alton', 'younger', 'brother', 'going', 'live', 'state', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'James', 'was', 'Civil', 'War', 'suddenly', 'Bounty', 'Hunter.James', 'naturally', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'Legend', 'get', 'even', 'bad', 'guy', 'Tunney', 'who', 'now', 'town', 'help', 'gang', 'railroad', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'course', 'marry', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'When', 'James', 'attacked', 'bad', 'guy', 'land', 'Baron', 'Tunney', 'gang', 'rescued', 'Indians', 'Michael', 'Spears', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'great', 'part', 'Indian', 'sister', 'biggest', 'problem', 'promising', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'developed.Justin', 'Ament', 'great', 'part', 'James', 'Conners', 'so', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'Angus', 'Macfayden', 'performance', 'bad', 'guy', 'land', 'Baron', 'Will', 'Tunney', 'gang', 'Tunney', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'town', 'dentist', 'instead', 'bad', 'Baron', 'most', 'time', 'cleaning', 'picking', 'teeth', 'gang', 'acted', 'bunch', 'immaturity', 'cases', 'anybody', 'grandmother', 'could', 'whip', 'minute', 'only', 'made', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'James', 'had', 'such', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'rid', 'guys.With', 'characters', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'story', 'line', 'missing', 'parts', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'plot', 'movie', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'could', 'predict', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'including', 'ending.I', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Western', 'movies', 'especially', 'classics', 'featured', 'great', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'really', 'great', 'bad', 'guys', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'bad', 'guys', 'movie', 'were', 'really', 'bad', 'seemed', 'someone', 'slapped', 'face', 'would', 'cry', 'babies', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'Western', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'underdeveloped', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'shadow', 'very', 'average', 'movie']",Shadowheart

I thought it was okay, there was no sex, and only one curse word that I could remember, yet there was some violence, not bad considering the normal violent movies.

Most of the films are about a west that never existed, but every once in a while you'll see something that's entertaining.""ShadowHeart"" is the sort of film you might see on the Hallmark Hall of Fame Channel.  The script is okay, and the acting is actually pretty good.  What makes it sort of an average film is the rather slow pace at which the story unfolds and lack of character development.  A lot of this film, especially the rather mawkish beginning, seems to be one establishing shot after another.I watched this dvd in two sittings.  During the first sitting, I got through the first half- hour or so.  After that I lost interest.  At that point, the Justin Ament character, James Conners, had returned to his hometown as a bounty hunter and proceeded to demand justice for his father's murder ten years or so previously.  At that point, Ament basically looked like a kid whom someone slapped a fake handlebar mustache on, and outfitted with typical cowboy gear. And way too laid back.It seemed improbable.  Someone hell-bent on revenge or justice would have had a better plan.  In retrospect, I guess the James Conners character was supposed to be such a tough guy that he inspired fear in anyone he came into contact with.  That really didn't come across too well. The end result wasn't due to any lack of acting skill on Ament's part; it had more to do with the script itself.So, at that point you had to use your imagination, because the film wasn't working very well. Which was why I turned the thing off and did something else.During the second sitting, I picked up where I left off and watched if the pace would pick up.  Eventually, it did, and the story started to unfold at a faster pace.  I'm not going to go into a plot synopsis, because you probably wouldn't be interested in reading it anyway.  Besides, if you really want to know what the story was about, you can read one of the other reviews.The film managed to hold my interest to its conclusion, but to be honest, I really didn't have anything else to watch anyway.  By the end of the film, I thought that ""ShadowHeart"" was about a B minus western.The most notable aspect of this film was the actor Angus Macfadyen , best known for his previous role as Robert Bruce in the Mel Gibson Film, ""BraveHeart"".  His acting style in portraying the villain Will Tunney reminded me a lot of Rod Steiger. I really liked his performance - it was fun to watch.""ShadowHeart"" isn't a film I'd want to watch over and over and over again.  It's not ""The Wild Bunch,"" or even ""The Hired Hand"".There's not a lot of action here... And certainly nothing to shock a viewing audience.

1251530,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B0026IQTO0,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[3, 6]","I'm going to have to blameDeadwood: The Complete Series. If it hadn't been for that series that brought nobility to pimps and whores and peppered everything with vulgarity and iambic pentameter, I would never expect Westerns to be as cool as I do. Furthermore, I wouldn't have been so in love with the idea of villains who are beneficial for the community at large and heroes who have tempers that ruin them. Most of all, I wouldn't expect the Western to be just a little bit historically accurate.But even without those high standards, this would be a pretty sorry movie. If you even halfway care about this thing, your eye rolls and groands will reach G-d's ear and hopefully smite the filmmakers where they stand.The thing begins badly with William Sadler as a preacher who has some problems with his rent. The town redneck shows up demanding the money. For the church. And then as they argue, he shoots the preacher. And gets away with it. Because those Western towns never liked their clergy in the first place.Flash forward 16 years or so and the son of that pastor comes back vowing revenge. Only he gets all wimpy and decides to marry his childhood sweetheart. By this point I've seen so many movies about childhood sweethearts, I'm almost tempted to look up Robin from the housing projects - see how she's doing - wonder if she remembers that her challenge of ""Race You!"" led to me falling on broken glass. Still got the scar on my hand from that one. But instead of reminiscing about old scars, our hero and his girlfriend run around and try to avoid the villain who is also trying to marry her, Snidely Whiplash style. There is a mention that there are prostitutes in those their saloons but you never get to see it.Like I said in the title, this is a Christian movie full of prattling about ""forgiveness"" and ""be all peaceful"". When the Noble Savages show up, the cute one is a Christian and she has to speechify over and over again.There are so many things wrong with this movie including the noble savages, the way the soundtrack gets to the bells and drums and ""native music"" whenever the Indians show up, the endless preaching and the confused plot about the mayor/villain trying to take over, but the worst part is the hypocrisy of violence.LikeTorchwood - The Complete First Season, the show presents us with a completely unredeemable villain who is twirling a mustache and ringing his hands in evil glee and then telling us that we SHOULDN'T kill him and he SHOULDN'T die and forgiveness is a virtue, blah blah. There's no connection between the characterization and the sermons because the writers don't have the skill or the inclination to give us a villain with ambiguity or redeeming values. For the most part, the hero isn't supposed to kill him because the hero is the hero and Jesus will not be very happy if he gives into his baser instincts. There is no discussion of what goes into revenge and violence; just a cartoon villain getting all villain-like without remorse.Boring and didactic; this is the kind of movie that is supposed to make Christians feel good about themselves, but really just makes everyone tired.",1,Warning: The overtly Christian tone is only part of the problem.,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,3145,"[""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'blameDeadwood', 'Complete', 'Series', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'series', 'brought', 'nobility', 'pimps', 'whores', 'peppered', 'everything', 'vulgarity', 'iambic', 'pentameter', 'would', 'never', 'expect', 'Westerns', 'be', 'as', 'cool', 'do', 'Furthermore', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'love', 'idea', 'villains', 'who', 'are', 'beneficial', 'community', 'large', 'heroes', 'who', 'have', 'tempers', 'ruin', 'Most', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Western', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'historically', 'accurate.But', 'even', 'high', 'standards', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'sorry', 'movie', 'even', 'halfway', 'care', 'thing', 'eye', 'rolls', 'groands', 'will', 'reach', 'G-d', 'ear', 'hopefully', 'smite', 'filmmakers', 'where', 'stand.The', 'thing', 'begins', 'badly', 'William', 'Sadler', 'preacher', 'who', 'problems', 'rent', 'town', 'redneck', 'up', 'demanding', 'money', 'church', 'then', 'argue', 'shoots', 'preacher', 'away', 'Western', 'towns', 'never', 'liked', 'clergy', 'first', 'place.Flash', 'forward', '16', 'years', 'so', 'son', 'pastor', 'back', 'vowing', 'revenge', 'Only', 'wimpy', 'decides', 'marry', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'point', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'childhood', 'sweethearts', ""'m"", 'almost', 'tempted', 'look', 'up', 'Robin', 'housing', 'projects', 'see', 'how', 'doing', 'wonder', 'challenge', 'Race', 'led', 'falling', 'broken', 'glass', 'Still', 'got', 'scar', 'hand', 'one', 'instead', 'reminiscing', 'old', 'scars', 'hero', 'girlfriend', 'run', 'around', 'try', 'avoid', 'villain', 'who', 'also', 'trying', 'marry', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'style', 'mention', 'are', 'prostitutes', 'saloons', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'it.Like', 'said', 'title', 'Christian', 'movie', 'full', 'prattling', 'forgiveness', 'be', 'peaceful', 'When', 'Noble', 'Savages', 'show', 'up', 'cute', 'one', 'Christian', 'speechify', 'again.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'including', 'noble', 'savages', 'way', 'soundtrack', 'bells', 'drums', 'native', 'music', 'whenever', 'Indians', 'show', 'up', 'endless', 'preaching', 'confused', 'plot', 'mayor/villain', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'worst', 'part', 'hypocrisy', 'violence.LikeTorchwood', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'show', 'completely', 'unredeemable', 'villain', 'who', 'twirling', 'mustache', 'ringing', 'hands', 'evil', 'glee', 'then', 'telling', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'kill', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'die', 'forgiveness', 'virtue', 'blah', 'blah', 'connection', 'characterization', 'sermons', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'skill', 'inclination', 'give', 'villain', 'ambiguity', 'redeeming', 'values', 'most', 'part', 'hero', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'kill', 'hero', 'hero', 'Jesus', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'baser', 'instincts', 'discussion', 'what', 'revenge', 'violence', 'just', 'cartoon', 'villain', 'getting', 'villain-like', 'remorse.Boring', 'didactic', 'kind', 'movie', 'supposed', 'make', 'Christians', 'feel', 'good', 'really', 'just', 'everyone', 'tired']",Shadowheart

My parents were Baby Boomers and they made sure my siblings and I knew about Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Paladin, the Lone Ranger, and the Cisco Kid. Most of the films we watched were somewhat melodramatic with a formulaic plot that included a good dose of humor and or music. I've re-watched some of those films recently and even the most formulaic of these stories is better than the average films Hollywood now pushes out. There are certain characteristics of the genre and the reason Westerns often seem to fail nowadays is because filmmakers just don't understand the genre. Such is the case with SHADOWHEART.SHADOWHEART is an independent, low-budget Western that revolves around the character of James Conners (Justin Ament). The opening segment of the movie shows the relationships between Conners with his best friend, Johny Cooper (the older version portrayed by Shawn Reaves), his sweetheart Mary Cooper (older version portrayed by Marnie Alton), and his father,Thomas Conners (William Sadler). Thomas is the pastor of the small church in the town. The church building is one that he has built by his hand from the bottom up. On a summer day he is putting the finishing coats of white paint on the steeple when he is approached by Will Tunney (Angus MacFayden). Tunney is a local drunk and lowlife. However, Tunney informs Rev. Conners that last night in a game of cards he won the deed for the land the church sits on. He gives the Reverend two days to pay off the money he still owes on the deed otherwise he is evicting him. The Reverend is dismayed and Tunney shoots the man in cold blood. However, there are no witnesses to the crime and when the sheriff arrives two traveling lowlifes claim they saw the Reverend preparing to throw a hammer at Tunney. Thomas last words to James are that he forgive those who wrong him. With that, James is left an orphan and leaves behind his town and sets out for family who live in the South.Fifteen years pass by. The Civil War has come and gone and now Tunney is a respected businessman and mayor of the town. Through murder, extortion, and other unsavory means he owns all of the land in town. When James returns home to seek out his long-lost love, Mary, he also plans on seeking revenge on Tunney. But Mary and Thomas Conner's words of forgiveness weight heavy upon James and leave him conflicted. What will he do, what will he do?Angus MacFayden gives a wonderful performance as Will Tunney. He steals every scene he is in. Most of the other cast give decent performances, though there are some moments of blandness. That's about the only redeeming features about SHADOWHEART. The rest is a hodge-podge mix-match mess.Let's start off with what SHADOWHEART portends to be.  The DVD cover states that the movie is an exciting Western about a man who returns to his hometown to seek revenge for his father's murder only to, ""discover a Native American world where justice has no name and vengeance rides in the shadows."" Well, there are only two Indians in most of the movie and neither one of them seems to be part of the world in which they are living. In fact, they are escapees from group of natives being moved to a reservation. When we first meet them they appear more like a line of slaves being brought to market instead of the actual groups of people that were forced to move to reservations.Most of the dialog is quite silly and melodramatic. The actors do what they can with it, but there's only so much you can do when given pressed ham and cheese to work with.The story is all over the map. You think the overall story is going to be about James coming home to seek his revenge, but finding redemption instead. Well, he does, but then the bad guys escape and instead of redemption, James is left wanting revenge again. Bad guys appear out of nowhere, none the more apparent than a character called Spider who seems only to exist as a deux ex a machine for the bad guys and to give the director an opportunity to act in the movie. Railroad men, who were some of the most ruthless and consistent figures in history, alter their plans for a railroad at the request of a small town land baron whom they will never see again.Oh, and then there's the whole them of SHADOWHEART.  Is it about revenge or redemption? Well, the two are kind of related, but they are distinct things. The movie confuses the two all the time and ends with a message that you can get redemption through revenge even if it goes against everything else in the movie. James father, his girl Mary, and even the Indian woman he meets all tell him that he won't see his loved ones again if his heart if full of shadow that is tinted with bloodlust. Yet, that's exactly what he does and in the end everything turns out alright. It just doesn't fit.I realize that my taste in movies are different from my parents. They were lovers of Westerns. So, I keep asking myself what my Dad and Mom would think of SHADOWHEART. I think they would say, ""It's okay,"" and that would be it.  That's about the highest praise this movie should receive because beyond the acting, particularly Angus MacFayden's performance, SHADOWHEART should be a movie better left in the shadows.",2,Better Off

The only real enjoyment I got out of this was heckling it with my friends.  There is a review on the cover that says it is the best western since ""Tombstone""; That is a bold face lie.  In addition it says that it has Daniel Baldwin on the cover.
