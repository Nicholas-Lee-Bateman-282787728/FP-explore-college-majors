I did get one of the sets with a bad disc but a simple phone call and a replacement was at my door in a few days.It is really great to see how Anthony started his now incredible career as not only a Chef and Television host but a very good writer. I have been a fan for a long time and I am happy to see him get the attention he deserves.His current show &#34;Parts Unknown&#34;on CNN shows how is only getting better at what he does.I use his shows as a way to gauge the quality of show that attempt to do what he does. I am looking forward to seeing where he takes us next.,5,The early years.,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,644,"['very', 'nice', 'set', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'had', 'hoped', 'did', 'get', 'one', 'sets', 'bad', 'disc', 'simple', 'phone', 'call', 'replacement', 'was', 'door', 'few', 'days.It', 'really', 'great', 'see', 'how', 'Anthony', 'started', 'now', 'incredible', 'career', 'not', 'only', 'Chef', 'Television', 'host', 'very', 'good', 'writer', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'long', 'time', 'am', 'happy', 'see', 'get', 'attention', 'current', 'show', '34', 'Parts', 'Unknown', '34', 'CNN', 'how', 'only', 'getting', 'better', 'what', 'shows', 'way', 'gauge', 'quality', 'show', 'attempt', 'do', 'what', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'where', 'next']",Anthony Bourdain - A Cook's Tour

Overall I was very pleased with this set, and I found that Tony hasn't lost an ounce of his spunk, and/or his aptitude to seek out good, quality food.  I contacted Questar about the issue with disc 6, and I received a replacement promptly. I easily forget about issues like that when they are taken care of by those who made the mistake. Keep up the good work Tony!",5,In the Beginning,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,517,"['bought', 'set', 'DVDs', 'have', 'just', 'gotten', 'watching', 'shows', 'thought', 'would', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'Bourdain', 'Early', 'Years', 'Overall', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'set', 'found', 'Tony', ""n't"", 'lost', 'ounce', 'spunk', 'and/or', 'aptitude', 'seek', 'out', 'good', 'quality', 'food', 'contacted', 'Questar', 'issue', 'disc', '6', 'received', 'replacement', 'promptly', 'easily', 'forget', 'issues', 'when', 'are', 'taken', 'care', 'who', 'made', 'mistake', 'Keep', 'good', 'work', 'Tony']",Anthony Bourdain - A Cook's Tour

Put them together with a host as interesting and personable as Anthony Bourdain and you've got yourself a winner.  It seems Tony is open to just about anything you throw at him but is always polite and kind to his hosts and guides.In this day of big mouth, rude cooking entertainers it is refreshing to watch a well-mannered gentleman traveling the world and showing us the cuisine of many cultures.

1504362,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B005W2BWDA,P Magnum,"[0, 0]","Anthony Bourdain was riding high with the success of his memoir Kitchen Confidential when he pitched the idea of traveling the world in search of the perfect meal and writing about it to his publisher.  To his amazement they bought the idea but came back with the plan to also have his adventures filmed for broadcast on the Food Network.  Mr. Bourdain had been super critical of celebrity chefs, so it was not without heavy irony that he went along with plan.  He referred to it as selling out and lucky for us he did.  A Cook's Tour and his follow-up series No Reservations are among the finest shows made for television.  Mr. Bourdain has a wry and sardonic nature that comes across perfectly on the small screen. For those who love No Reservations, A Cook's Tour episodes are only a half-hour and they are mainly about Mr. Bourdain's search for food and less about the social environment than No Reservations.  The main complaint I have about the set is that group the episodes by region they were filmed in as opposed to chronological order.  While each episode stands on its own and can really be watched in any order, it would have been nice to have it chronically to watch the series in its correct order if you so desired.",5,In Search Of The Perfect Meal,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,1231,"['Anthony', 'Bourdain', 'was', 'riding', 'high', 'success', 'memoir', 'Kitchen', 'Confidential', 'when', 'pitched', 'idea', 'traveling', 'world', 'search', 'perfect', 'meal', 'writing', 'publisher', 'amazement', 'bought', 'idea', 'came', 'back', 'plan', 'also', 'have', 'adventures', 'filmed', 'broadcast', 'Food', 'Network', 'Mr.', 'Bourdain', 'had', 'been', 'super', 'critical', 'celebrity', 'chefs', 'was', 'not', 'heavy', 'irony', 'went', 'along', 'plan', 'referred', 'selling', 'out', 'lucky', 'did', 'Cook', 'Tour', 'follow-up', 'series', 'No', 'Reservations', 'are', 'finest', 'shows', 'made', 'television', 'Mr.', 'Bourdain', 'wry', 'sardonic', 'nature', 'across', 'perfectly', 'small', 'screen', 'who', 'love', 'Reservations', 'A', 'Cook', 'Tour', 'episodes', 'are', 'only', 'half-hour', 'are', 'mainly', 'Mr.', 'Bourdain', 'search', 'food', 'less', 'social', 'environment', 'Reservations', 'main', 'complaint', 'have', 'set', 'group', 'episodes', 'region', 'were', 'filmed', 'as', 'opposed', 'chronological', 'order', 'episode', 'own', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'watched', 'order', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'chronically', 'watch', 'series', 'correct', 'order', 'so', 'desired']",Anthony Bourdain - A Cook's Tour
1504363,A1TR9417Z4U72F,B005W2BWDA,"S. M. Robare ""smurfwreck""","[10, 11]","I first stumbled upon Anthony Bourdain's writing a couple years after his magnum opus on the food service industry,Kitchen Confidential Updated Edition: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (P.S.), was released and quickly became a fan of his very 70s punk view of what it's like to work the line and run a restaurant.  When I heard that he was writing his next book,A Cook's Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines, as well as filming a television show to back it up I was very excited and intrigued by the concept.  In a nutshell, Bourdain traveled the globe stopping off in places that have either had a profound affect on him culturally (such as visiting Vietnam because of films like Apocalypse Now) or on his culinary proclivities (such as visiting the hometown of his longtime employer in Portugal or the spot of his first childhood food epiphany in France.)  Along the way he does his best to completely open himself up to any available gastronomical experiences which can at times be weird, exciting, or downright disgusting (like eating the still-beating heart of a cobra or trying barbequed lizard on a stick.)The television series, which ran for two seasons back around the turn of the millennium, was at the time some of the most interesting programming on the Food Network focusing more on real life and a wide variety of cultural experiences (as opposed to the typical shows which center on short-cut cooking and product placement.)  Though Bourdain has a hearty sense of humor and charisma that could easily place him among the ranks of the other Food Network celebrity chefs, it quickly became clear during the second season that (which featured travel beyond the scope of the original book and concept) he was under heavy pressure from the network to ""get in-line"" with their outlook and direction content-wise as he was visiting places (like the Mall of America), where it's obvious he does not want to be.  Luckily, he stepped away from the show and the network and found a home elsewhere where he's free to make the content he wants to.Pop culture-wise, this series is probably best known for introducing the public to the idea of extremely weird eating (bugs, lizards, cobras, you name it), but that's only on the surface.  The heart of the show is really about digging into other cultures and opening oneself up to trying all kinds of cuisine.As for the DVD set, I was surprised when I found a copy up at my local Target as I thought this series was stuck in a Food Network limbo.  The packaging was alarming in it's poor production design quality, but at twenty bucks I thought it was worth a glance to see if the actually DVD picture and sound quality was decent.  Besides, I never expected the series would be released so I figured I better snag a copy before it disappeared.  All in all, it's not that bad, quality-wise, with a 8 out of 10 on picture and 7 out of 10 on sound quality.  To be honest, it's been so long since I saw it in its original run that this might be more or less how it originally aired.  My main complaint with the set is that it's presented in a six disc set that's broken up disc by disc into world regions (US, Mexico & the Americas, Europe, Morocco & Russia, Asia, and Australia & Japan) instead of being set up in either production or air-date order.  So it's hard to figure out what is the first and second season.  I guess for those really intrigued by the series it's well worth picking up the first book and doing your best to use it as a guide to the first season.",4,A primer for broadening one's food horizons...,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,3529,"['first', 'stumbled', 'Anthony', 'Bourdain', 'writing', 'couple', 'years', 'magnum', 'opus', 'food', 'service', 'industry', 'Kitchen', 'Confidential', 'Updated', 'Edition', 'Adventures', 'Culinary', 'Underbelly', 'P.S', 'was', 'released', 'quickly', 'became', 'fan', 'very', '70s', 'punk', 'view', 'what', 'work', 'line', 'run', 'restaurant', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'writing', 'next', 'book', 'Cook', 'Tour', 'Global', 'Adventures', 'Extreme', 'Cuisines', 'as', 'well', 'filming', 'television', 'show', 'back', 'up', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'intrigued', 'concept', 'nutshell', 'Bourdain', 'traveled', 'globe', 'stopping', 'off', 'places', 'have', 'had', 'profound', 'affect', 'culturally', 'such', 'visiting', 'Vietnam', 'films', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'culinary', 'proclivities', 'such', 'visiting', 'hometown', 'longtime', 'employer', 'Portugal', 'spot', 'first', 'childhood', 'food', 'epiphany', 'France', 'way', 'best', 'completely', 'open', 'up', 'available', 'gastronomical', 'experiences', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'weird', 'exciting', 'downright', 'disgusting', 'eating', 'still-beating', 'heart', 'cobra', 'trying', 'barbequed', 'lizard', 'stick', 'television', 'series', 'ran', 'two', 'seasons', 'back', 'turn', 'millennium', 'was', 'time', 'most', 'interesting', 'programming', 'Food', 'Network', 'focusing', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'wide', 'variety', 'cultural', 'experiences', 'opposed', 'typical', 'shows', 'center', 'short-cut', 'cooking', 'product', 'placement', 'Bourdain', 'hearty', 'sense', 'humor', 'charisma', 'could', 'easily', 'place', 'ranks', 'other', 'Food', 'Network', 'celebrity', 'chefs', 'quickly', 'became', 'clear', 'second', 'season', 'featured', 'travel', 'scope', 'original', 'book', 'concept', 'was', 'heavy', 'pressure', 'network', 'get', 'in-line', 'outlook', 'direction', 'content-wise', 'was', 'visiting', 'places', 'Mall', 'America', 'where', 'obvious', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'Luckily', 'stepped', 'away', 'show', 'network', 'found', 'home', 'elsewhere', 'where', 'free', 'make', 'content', 'to.Pop', 'culture-wise', 'series', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'introducing', 'public', 'idea', 'extremely', 'weird', 'eating', 'bugs', 'lizards', 'cobras', 'name', 'only', 'surface', 'heart', 'show', 'really', 'digging', 'other', 'cultures', 'opening', 'trying', 'kinds', 'cuisine.As', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'found', 'copy', 'up', 'local', 'Target', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'stuck', 'Food', 'Network', 'limbo', 'packaging', 'was', 'alarming', 'poor', 'production', 'design', 'quality', 'twenty', 'bucks', 'thought', 'was', 'worth', 'glance', 'see', 'actually', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'decent', 'never', 'expected', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'so', 'figured', 'better', 'snag', 'copy', 'disappeared', 'not', 'bad', 'quality-wise', '8', '10', 'picture', '7', '10', 'sound', 'quality', 'be', 'honest', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'saw', 'original', 'run', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'how', 'originally', 'aired', 'main', 'complaint', 'set', 'presented', 'six', 'disc', 'set', 'broken', 'up', 'disc', 'disc', 'world', 'regions', 'US', 'Mexico', 'Americas', 'Europe', 'Morocco', 'Russia', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'instead', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'production', 'air-date', 'order', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'guess', 'really', 'intrigued', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'first', 'book', 'doing', 'best', 'use', 'guide', 'first', 'season']",Anthony Bourdain - A Cook's Tour
