751552,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000093NTL,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[26, 29]","I was looking forward to this film. Indeed, I made sure it was at the top of my `Netflix' queue.  Unfortunately, it was the one that got away.  Soon there was a very long wait.  People are no doubt drawn to this film because they are longing for simple, good entertainment.  Perhaps they first saw it on `The Hallmark Channel' and wanted to see it again.  It's not all that great of a film, but it is worthwhile anyway.  That needs an explanation, so bear with me.  It certainly is easy to watch.  I think great film or not, it goes down easily and becomes a casual pleasure.  The subject matter is interesting even if the whole affair becomes no better than a lite (or, ""light"") version of 'The Horse Whisperer'.The story is the basis for a romantic culture clash.  Jordan Donovan (Teri Polo) is a photographer from New York City.  She's tired of the typical treadmill of romance.  In both aspects of her life she is trying to break through.  Her arty exhibits of (literally) garbage fail to spark interest for a sponsor of photography exhibits.  Meanwhile, her love interest,  Edward, has been dating her for years, but refuses to make a commitment.  Her roommate, Carla, (Christine Tucci) is presented like a half-funny, but easily as likable Rhoda.  She plays matchmaker by signing her up for `Cowboy Connections,' a magazine with a ""Personals"" column designed to hook up couples out West.All too neatly, Carla has taken the liberty of not only putting her friend's name in the magazine, but writing her background and answering any prospects that come to her.  On Jordan's birthday, she not only has a man, but a plane ticket for her to join him at his ranch in Wyoming.  Cynically, she, nevertheless, does what most people would do at the prospect of adventure:  She accepts both as a present.Even more neatly, Tyler Ross (Andrew McCarthy) has a doting sister named Laurie (Patricia Kalember) who answers his personal ads for him.  Jaundiced about dating again, he doesn't think much when she calls to tell him a woman from NYC is coming to his ranch.  Something must stir inside him, for we discover earlier it is he who provides the plane ticket.Her arrival is not a friendly one.  Quickly, the resentment pours through:  At breakfast he tartly announces that they don't serve ""espresso"" at the morning table.  Later, when she's falls off a horse, he nastily chides,  ""I don't want some big city lawyer trying to sue me.""  She understandably doesn't allow herself to be a walking mat.  She has some counter resentments to offer:  going toe-to-toe she has plenty to say about cholesterol soaked breakfasts and his backward behavior.  Yet, she has a background that he doesn't even consider, and as the movie unfolds, she has several opportunities to prove herself more than a typical city slicker.Across the way former friend, Mr. Jameson, is brazen about trespassing on Tyler's land to capture wild mustangs for his own use.  United Tyler and Jordan try to oppose his lawless horse trade while working out some terms of bitterness found in everyone's past.Some of the appeal of the movie is the scenery.  Mustangs rush past with autumnal mountain horizons while the pair take on the work of the land.  The old-fashioned Western score by Mader is superb for the laid back adventure, and the tenderness of key scenes works its way incrementally as it goes along.Pleasant, enjoyable, and easy-going like a trek to Wyoming itself,  `Straight from the Heart' may not have the best performances, nor the most original dialogue, but it is still a pleasurable film trek anyway.  While I thought throughout the ""torn between two lovers"" scenario Jordan deserved better choices, who's to judge about taste if a relationship has a chance to work?  After all, sometimes even a two-star film is all we really need.",2,'The Horse Whisperer' Lite,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,3809,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'Indeed', 'made', 'sure', 'was', 'top', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'one', 'got', 'away', 'Soon', 'was', 'very', 'long', 'wait', 'People', 'are', 'doubt', 'drawn', 'film', 'are', 'longing', 'simple', 'good', 'entertainment', 'Perhaps', 'first', 'saw', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'anyway', 'explanation', 'so', 'bear', 'certainly', 'easy', 'watch', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'down', 'easily', 'casual', 'pleasure', 'subject', 'matter', 'interesting', 'even', 'whole', 'affair', 'better', 'lite', 'light', 'version', ""'The"", 'Horse', ""Whisperer'.The"", 'story', 'basis', 'romantic', 'culture', 'clash', 'Jordan', 'Donovan', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'photographer', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'tired', 'typical', 'treadmill', 'romance', 'aspects', 'life', 'trying', 'break', 'Her', 'arty', 'exhibits', 'literally', 'garbage', 'fail', 'spark', 'interest', 'sponsor', 'photography', 'exhibits', 'Meanwhile', 'love', 'interest', 'Edward', 'been', 'dating', 'years', 'make', 'commitment', 'roommate', 'Carla', 'Christine', 'Tucci', 'presented', 'half-funny', 'easily', 'likable', 'Rhoda', 'matchmaker', 'signing', 'up', 'Cowboy', 'Connections', 'magazine', 'Personals', 'column', 'designed', 'hook', 'up', 'couples', 'out', 'West.All', 'too', 'neatly', 'Carla', 'taken', 'liberty', 'not', 'only', 'putting', 'friend', 'name', 'magazine', 'writing', 'background', 'answering', 'prospects', 'come', 'Jordan', 'birthday', 'not', 'only', 'man', 'plane', 'ticket', 'join', 'ranch', 'Wyoming', 'Cynically', 'nevertheless', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'prospect', 'adventure', 'present.Even', 'more', 'neatly', 'Tyler', 'Ross', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'doting', 'sister', 'named', 'Laurie', 'Patricia', 'Kalember', 'who', 'personal', 'ads', 'Jaundiced', 'dating', 'again', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'when', 'tell', 'woman', 'NYC', 'coming', 'ranch', 'Something', 'must', 'stir', 'discover', 'earlier', 'who', 'plane', 'ticket.Her', 'arrival', 'not', 'friendly', 'one', 'Quickly', 'resentment', 'breakfast', 'tartly', 'do', ""n't"", 'serve', 'espresso', 'morning', 'table', 'Later', 'when', 'falls', 'off', 'horse', 'nastily', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'big', 'city', 'lawyer', 'trying', 'sue', 'understandably', ""n't"", 'allow', 'be', 'walking', 'mat', 'counter', 'resentments', 'offer', 'going', 'toe-to-toe', 'plenty', 'say', 'cholesterol', 'soaked', 'breakfasts', 'backward', 'behavior', 'background', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'several', 'opportunities', 'prove', 'more', 'typical', 'city', 'slicker.Across', 'way', 'former', 'friend', 'Mr.', 'Jameson', 'brazen', 'trespassing', 'Tyler', 'land', 'capture', 'wild', 'mustangs', 'own', 'use', 'United', 'Tyler', 'Jordan', 'try', 'oppose', 'lawless', 'horse', 'trade', 'working', 'out', 'terms', 'bitterness', 'found', 'everyone', 'past.Some', 'appeal', 'movie', 'scenery', 'Mustangs', 'rush', 'autumnal', 'mountain', 'horizons', 'pair', 'take', 'work', 'land', 'old-fashioned', 'Western', 'score', 'Mader', 'superb', 'laid', 'back', 'adventure', 'tenderness', 'key', 'scenes', 'way', 'incrementally', 'along.Pleasant', 'enjoyable', 'easy-going', 'trek', 'Wyoming', 'Straight', 'Heart', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'best', 'performances', 'most', 'original', 'dialogue', 'still', 'pleasurable', 'film', 'trek', 'anyway', 'thought', 'torn', 'two', 'lovers', 'scenario', 'Jordan', 'deserved', 'better', 'choices', 'who', 'judge', 'taste', 'relationship', 'chance', 'work', 'sometimes', 'even', 'two-star', 'film', 'really', 'need']",Straight From the Heart

I might add, not only did she love it, so did we all!The story involves two unhappy people living two entirely different lifestyles who have those who care about them wanting to help fix their lives. In both cases the well-meaning relative/friend decides to either place or answer an ad in a magazine for those seeking a spouse. This is done without the two unhappy people even knowing anything was afoot.It all works out that the girl, a New Yorker, is persuaded to journey to Wyoming to meet the boy, a rancher, mostly to satisfy the friend.What happens then is the core of the story and easily holds one's attention; there is misunderstanding, conflict, surprises, and joy; the scenery is majestic and contributes to the joy of simply watching the story unfold.The rancher is still suffering the loss of his wife who died at the birth of their child and is very busy blaming himself for what happened. It so happens that the rancher is skilled as a horse-whisperer and trains horses using this technique; there are many scenes of horses running against magnificent backgrounds as well as a ""joining-up"" scene where a wild horse finally accepts the horse-whisperer.By way of summary, the movie is captivating and persuasive; it provides a nice evening's entertainment!

751569,A3GV24GH1AFXDJ,B000093NTL,"FaithOryx ""Always Searching""","[3, 3]","I ordered this DVD on-line based on the amazing reviews it got here on Amazon.com without ever having seen it. I have to say, this is a very cute and wholesome story and I'm pleased to add it to my collection. However, I didn't see it as the 5 star film most everyone else did.First of all- the good points. I thought Andrew McCarthy did a fine job of illustrating a broken widower. He was appropriately ""manly"" about his pain which was both tender and wrenching. Also, he played a rancher, which of course gave him an ever ""manlier"" edge. Not comfortable with sharing emotion, he is tough and rough and sharp.Teri Polo was okay as the New Yorker who travels to the midwest based on a singles ad that her friend answered.One of the things that bothered me was that neither character could accept the singles ad. Was that not PC enough for America? What's the problem there? She had to have a friend do it and he had to have a sister do it. I thought it would have been nice if one of them were actually responsible for being there. Both made a big deal of rejecting responsibility for wanting to be there. He didn't want her at all (it was a deal with his sister) and she was... what? On a fling to defy her boyfriend?Long story short- the movie was great in many ways. The scenery was amazing. I loved the substory- the wild horses. (Even though the ""taming"" method was ridiculous.) I LOVED the sister and her story.I guess it comes down to the biggest complaint. I felt zero chemistry from the two main characters. It was SO wholesome. I don't want to spoil the ending at all. But basically, I rolled my eyes. I didn't feel it at all or believe it. And trust me, I'm not asking for anything raunchy. (My fave movie is Anne of Green Gables!)

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Fine arts photographer Jordan Donovan (Teri Polo), frustrated with a boyfriend (Greg Evigan) who won't commmit, is persuaded by her best friend to go along with a pretense. See, her friend had responded to an ad for a mail order bride and, in the correspondence, had passed herself off as Jordan. Now Jordan leaves the comforts and the slick of New York City and heads out west to Wyoming to meet surly cowboy Tyler Ross (Andrew McCarthy). But here's another kicker: it was Tyler's sister who had posted the ad, much to Tyler's dismay. Tyler had some time ago withdrawn from the world when his wife passed away, and he's just not that ready to let it go. So, predictably, it's an awkward first meet for Jordan and Tyler. She's dubious but is at least willing to play along. He doesn't even try. Initially.STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART presents us with an unusual role for Andrew McCarthy, or so it seems to me. Andrew McCarthy as a man of few words and fewer smiles? That seems more implausible than, say, a mannequin coming to life or lugging around a dead guy and passing him off as still a breather. I haven't seen McCarthy in anything in years, but I remember him for those fidgety yuppie characters from ST. ELMO'S FIRE, LESS THAN ZERO, and WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S. So it's jarring at first to see him playing against type, playing someone rugged and restrained and tall on a saddle. The years have added lines and wrinkles to his face and they flatter him. Andrew McCarthy looks the part of the weathered, morose horse rancher. He projects palpable sorrow and a world weariness and deep resentment. I guess he did shed his Brat Pack image after all.I've always liked Teri Polo. There's just something so winning about her. I love that she always seems to be grounded no matter how wacky the film that she's in (MEET THE PARENTS and its sequels). STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART isn't one of them sweeping romances, per se. The mademoiselle doesn't catch the vapors. The gent doesn't indulge in grand gestures... well, okay, he does in the end. Mostly, the film takes its time. After all, he's a grieving widower and she's an unproven city slicker, a pesky, walking invasion of his privacy. But there's gratification in watching them engage in caustic sparring and shape a relationship and gradually develop a mutual attraction. I happen to think that the ending comes too abruptly; I guess I wanted to savor those closing moments a bit longer, even if the whole sequence is over-the-top. In a film filled with quiet little moments, I guess you're allowed one grand gesture.",4,Andrew McCarthy channels the Marlboro Man,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,2561,"['Fine', 'arts', 'photographer', 'Jordan', 'Donovan', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'frustrated', 'boyfriend', 'Greg', 'Evigan', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'commmit', 'persuaded', 'best', 'friend', 'go', 'along', 'pretense', 'See', 'friend', 'had', 'responded', 'ad', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'correspondence', 'had', 'passed', 'off', 'Jordan', 'Now', 'Jordan', 'comforts', 'slick', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'heads', 'out', 'west', 'Wyoming', 'meet', 'surly', 'cowboy', 'Tyler', 'Ross', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'here', 'kicker', 'was', 'Tyler', 'sister', 'who', 'had', 'posted', 'ad', 'much', 'Tyler', 'dismay', 'Tyler', 'had', 'time', 'withdrawn', 'world', 'when', 'wife', 'passed', 'away', 'just', 'not', 'ready', 'let', 'go', 'So', 'predictably', 'awkward', 'first', 'meet', 'Jordan', 'Tyler', 'dubious', 'least', 'willing', 'play', 'along', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'Initially.STRAIGHT', 'THE', 'HEART', 'unusual', 'role', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'so', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'fewer', 'smiles', 'more', 'implausible', 'say', 'mannequin', 'coming', 'life', 'lugging', 'dead', 'guy', 'passing', 'off', 'still', 'breather', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'McCarthy', 'anything', 'years', 'remember', 'fidgety', 'yuppie', 'characters', 'ST.', 'ELMO', 'FIRE', 'LESS', 'THAN', 'ZERO', 'WEEKEND', 'AT', 'BERNIE', 'jarring', 'first', 'see', 'playing', 'type', 'playing', 'someone', 'rugged', 'restrained', 'tall', 'saddle', 'years', 'have', 'added', 'lines', 'wrinkles', 'face', 'flatter', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'part', 'weathered', 'morose', 'horse', 'rancher', 'projects', 'palpable', 'sorrow', 'world', 'weariness', 'deep', 'resentment', 'guess', 'did', 'shed', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'image', 'all.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'just', 'something', 'so', 'winning', 'love', 'always', 'be', 'grounded', 'matter', 'how', 'film', 'MEET', 'THE', 'PARENTS', 'sequels', 'THE', 'HEART', ""n't"", 'one', 'sweeping', 'romances', 'se', 'mademoiselle', ""n't"", 'catch', 'vapors', 'gent', ""n't"", 'indulge', 'grand', 'gestures', 'well', 'okay', 'end', 'Mostly', 'film', 'time', 'grieving', 'widower', 'unproven', 'city', 'slicker', 'pesky', 'walking', 'invasion', 'privacy', 'gratification', 'watching', 'engage', 'caustic', 'sparring', 'shape', 'relationship', 'gradually', 'develop', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'happen', 'think', 'ending', 'too', 'abruptly', 'guess', 'wanted', 'savor', 'closing', 'moments', 'bit', 'longer', 'even', 'whole', 'sequence', 'over-the-top', 'film', 'filled', 'quiet', 'little', 'moments', 'guess', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'one', 'grand', 'gesture']",Straight From the Heart

I guess I'm just a sappy romantic at heart. This film's been airing on the Hallmark Channel, and I find myself watching it over and over, to the point where I came here to find out if it was on DVD. Thank goodness it is!I particularly appreciated the cinematography and settings, and well... okay. I really appreciated Andrew McCarthy in his jeans. :) As a mustang adopter and advocate, I can't say that the depiction of mustangs and the BLM (called the ""DLM"" in the film) is really terribly accurate, but I'm EXTREMELY gratified to see a film even approaching the question of wild horse management in such a positive way. (Of course, when it comes to training mustangs, I wouldn't try this at home; while we see Tyler using some pretty decent training methods, he's also working with a domestic quarter horse rather than a range-fresh mustang; the real thing doesn't tend to go that fast or easy. ;))I think they did a nice job of making the characters both believable and likeable, and the various conflicts and situations actually make sense, unlike too many films where things could just be resolved if the characters would stop behaving like morons. :) Andrew McCarthy does a really nice job as a gruff cowboy type... and he certainly sits a horse well, too.",5,Sometimes a corny romance is a good thing.,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,1373,"[""'m"", 'more', 'Aliens', 'sort', 'girl', 'romance', 'fan', 'have', 'admit', 'absolutely', 'loving', 'movie', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'sappy', 'romantic', 'heart', 'film', 'been', 'airing', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'find', 'watching', 'over', 'point', 'where', 'came', 'here', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'DVD', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'particularly', 'appreciated', 'cinematography', 'settings', 'well', 'okay', 'really', 'appreciated', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'jeans', 'mustang', 'adopter', 'advocate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'depiction', 'mustangs', 'BLM', 'called', 'DLM', 'film', 'really', 'terribly', 'accurate', ""'m"", 'EXTREMELY', 'gratified', 'see', 'film', 'even', 'approaching', 'question', 'wild', 'horse', 'management', 'positive', 'way', 'course', 'when', 'training', 'mustangs', 'would', ""n't"", 'try', 'home', 'see', 'Tyler', 'using', 'pretty', 'decent', 'training', 'methods', 'also', 'working', 'domestic', 'quarter', 'horse', 'rather', 'range-fresh', 'mustang', 'real', 'thing', ""n't"", 'tend', 'go', 'fast', 'easy', 'think', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'making', 'characters', 'believable', 'likeable', 'various', 'conflicts', 'situations', 'actually', 'make', 'sense', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'where', 'things', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'resolved', 'characters', 'would', 'stop', 'behaving', 'morons', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'really', 'nice', 'job', 'gruff', 'cowboy', 'type', 'certainly', 'horse', 'well', 'too']",Straight From the Heart
