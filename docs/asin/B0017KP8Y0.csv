1157313,A39VF2QMR5SVSS,B0017KP8Y0,,"[0, 0]","It is a delight to watch a series that concentrates on character development rather than gaudy special effects & graphic violence. Benton Frazier, Paul Gross's character, is a Canadian mounty seeking the murderer and reasons for his father's death. Such a mundane story could have proven boring over the years this series existed, but there were some excellent things going for it. 1. There is no laugh track. A laugh track is a sign that the originators know the production is not funny. This show is funny in it's own right. 2. They employed selected actors from another of my favorite Canadian imports, Red Green Show. And the writers were brilliant. They used each actor's talents to produce a show balanced on unique, genuine characters. I didn't know it was going to take so long the first time I put on this series, but I couldn't stop. Each story is a unique experience, sort of like McGyver on steroids. Chicago was fairly realistic. If Canadians are even remotely like this, I am so sad I have never met any. .... or maybe I have, here.",5,It is a delight towatch a series that concentrates on character development ...,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,1046,"['delight', 'watch', 'series', 'character', 'development', 'rather', 'gaudy', 'special', 'effects', 'graphic', 'violence', 'Benton', 'Frazier', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'character', 'Canadian', 'mounty', 'seeking', 'murderer', 'reasons', 'father', 'death', 'mundane', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'proven', 'boring', 'years', 'series', 'existed', 'were', 'excellent', 'things', 'going', '1', 'laugh', 'track', 'laugh', 'track', 'sign', 'originators', 'know', 'production', 'not', 'funny', 'show', 'funny', 'own', 'right', '2', 'employed', 'selected', 'actors', 'favorite', 'Canadian', 'imports', 'Red', 'Green', 'Show', 'writers', 'were', 'brilliant', 'used', 'actor', 'talents', 'produce', 'show', 'balanced', 'unique', 'genuine', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'so', 'long', 'first', 'time', 'put', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'story', 'unique', 'experience', 'sort', 'like', 'McGyver', 'steroids', 'Chicago', 'was', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'Canadians', 'are', 'even', 'remotely', 'am', 'so', 'sad', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'maybe', 'have', 'here']",N/A

1157316,A24ZKGYGJU5GK7,B0017KP8Y0,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","The show itself is one of my favorite shows of the 90s. Due South has some fantastic characters, great comedy, and it has some good action as well. They absolutely love to have fun with Canadian and American stereotypes (especially how polite Canadians are), have plenty of fun with sticking a Mountie out of his element in the middle of Chicago, and this show is just plain good family fun. It's a real shame that they didn't make more of it.As for this particular release, I'd advise against picking it up unless you just want the show cheap and don't care about video quality. The video has been way, _way_ over-compressed. They have too many episodes per disc, and the result is that the video is highly pixelated. It's the worst quality that I have ever seen on a commercial DVD. On the bright side, it's cheap, so if you don't want to pay much, then you can get the whole series for cheap, but you get what you pay for.If you really want this show at decent quality, I would advise picking up the Canadian releases of the show. It comes in 4 parts and unfortunately costs at least 4 times as much, but you actually get good quality with that release. You can pick them up at amazon (the full set can currently be found here:Due South (4 pack) Season 1,2,3 PlusThe Final Season), or you might be able to find them at amazon.ca for somewhat cheaper depending on what the exact pricing looks like when you read this. But I seriously regret having picked up this release, and as soon as I figured out what was going on, I picked up the Canadian one, and I don't regret it one bit.The show is 5 stars, and the release is 1, so I'm giving it a 3.",3,"Fantastic Show, Horrible Release",1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1646,"['show', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', '90s', 'Due', 'South', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'great', 'comedy', 'good', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'absolutely', 'love', 'have', 'fun', 'Canadian', 'American', 'stereotypes', 'especially', 'how', 'polite', 'Canadians', 'are', 'have', 'plenty', 'fun', 'sticking', 'Mountie', 'element', 'middle', 'Chicago', 'show', 'just', 'plain', 'good', 'family', 'fun', 'real', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'it.As', 'particular', 'release', ""'d"", 'advise', 'picking', 'up', 'just', 'want', 'show', 'cheap', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'video', 'quality', 'video', 'been', 'way', '_way_', 'over-compressed', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'disc', 'result', 'video', 'highly', 'pixelated', 'worst', 'quality', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'commercial', 'DVD', 'bright', 'side', 'cheap', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'pay', 'much', 'then', 'can', 'get', 'whole', 'series', 'cheap', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'for.If', 'really', 'want', 'show', 'decent', 'quality', 'would', 'advise', 'picking', 'up', 'Canadian', 'releases', 'show', '4', 'parts', 'unfortunately', 'costs', 'least', '4', 'times', 'as', 'much', 'actually', 'get', 'good', 'quality', 'release', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'amazon', 'full', 'set', 'can', 'currently', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Due', 'South', '4', 'pack', 'Season', '1,2,3', 'PlusThe', 'Final', 'Season', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'amazon.ca', 'somewhat', 'cheaper', 'depending', 'what', 'exact', 'pricing', 'looks', 'when', 'read', 'seriously', 'regret', 'having', 'picked', 'up', 'release', 'as', 'soon', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'picked', 'up', 'Canadian', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'one', 'bit.The', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'release', '1', ""'m"", 'giving', '3']",N/A
1157317,A2AGQHF6JICYZQ,B0017KP8Y0,Amazon Customer,"[52, 54]","A friend of mine has the ""Ultimate"" US release featured on this page. I collected the original Canadian sets as they were released. Seen both. I wrote the following as Amazon commentary on the US releases of individual seasons. Still stand by it.True, the US sets are cheaper than the Canada sets (though if you buy the Canada sets from Amazon.ca, they're LOTS cheaper than buying them as imports from Amazon.com). True, the Canadian sets have difficult packaging (DVD overlay and spindles that require a lot of pressure before you can pop out the disk without risk of damage). True the first two Canadian season sets use the dreaded ""flipper"" (2-sided) disks. True what we saw in the US as a third season of 22 (missing four episodes, by the way) was produced and broadcast in Canada as two seasons of 13 each -- and the third and fourth DVD sets are released separately too. (Does the US ""third season"" set have all 26?) And most ironic truth of all: if I'd known that by waiting, I'd have gotten all three sets cheaper from an American distributor, I'd've taken that route too.However -- the Canadian sets feature pristine transfers. (I've read that the US sets use videotape as the masters; I'm not sure where this info comes from, but it doesn't make sense that the masters would be any different than what the Alliance sets drew upon, since they license the material.) The Canadian sets feature disks running at the highest speed. (The American disks are single sided because they jam twice the normal amount of eps. per side, and run at a slower speed. That, it seems to me, would account for VHS-like resolution.) The Canadian sets, for whatever it's worth, do feature accurate packaging (the right cast members listed and featured in illustrations). And finally ---- small thing though it may be ---- the Canadian Final (4th) Season set does have a small but utterly delightful extra. Paul Gross does a running commentary for both parts of CALL OF THE WILD. I can live without most commentary tracks I hear, but this is one you'll return to. It's witty, wryly funny and thoughtfully observed.I won't tell you not to save the dough on the American release, I empathize ... I'll only tell you, the Canadian sets have more vibrant sound and video. And in the end, it's what's ON the DVD that matters the most ... isn't it?",4,Fine for Fans on a Budget.

The DVD set contains all 65 episodes and was created by Paul Haggis. Video quality is what you'd expect for the time. If you like cop stuff (I don't) it will do. All cop shows utilize the same formula: good cop/bad cop face adversity together to get the bad guy. All these shows suffer from the same maladies. Haggis' idea of sending a Mountie to Chicago to explore the differences between Canadians and Americans was far-fetched and doesn't really work. The mountie character is extremely irritating in his constant lecturing mode. The Chicago cop is extremely irritating in his continuous whining, brawling mode. The two partners don't match and in effect this doesn't work. Garner and Selleck (both whiners) had similar maladies. Magnum had a good formula; Rockford's oblique formula was not. However, Haggis has come up with some unique scripting in covering a different subject in each episode of due South and some very creative writing in giving us different viewpoints. So in reality it's not like any previous formula cop show you have ever seen. Cop shows now make up 90% of all TV programming, defining the United States as a p*olice st*te! Today's cop show (2014) utilizes more brutality, robots, and desecration of a citizen's rights (guilty until proven innocent) to deaden the population into accepting that they no longer have any viable Constitutional rights and that cops have unlimited power and can do anything they please. For instance, the new Patriot Act allows the F*I to break into your home while you're not there, and not inform you for up to a month! The Dept of HS has taken away all your Constitutional rights!One very interesting aspect of due South is that the mountie cannot be armed, because he is not an American cop, so only the Chicago cop carries a gun. This results in him figuring out ways to operate without one, while the Chicago cop blows the crap out of everything. The English police force was incepted in 1829 and the Bobby was only allowed to carry a whistle and a stick and did fine. Today's cop carries a Glock 17 with 51 rounds, enough to kill 51 victims all by himself. He also carries military-grade capsecum to melt a victim's corneas; a million-volt shocker to stop a victim's heart; cuffs and a stick, so that the victim can be subdued while being beaten; a walkie-talkie, so he can call his gang; and a battering flashlight, so he can beat you while shining a light in your eyes. Today's cop 'incites for felony arrest' to get you into the system, so that it will cost you $20,000 (to corrupt attorneys and judges) to not be put in an animal cage and raped. Cops are trained to shoot you though the lip, to sever your spinal chord to make sure you are dead, so that you cannot later sue. If a cop murders a victim, he is given a paid vacation until reinstatement. Cops cannot be sued in Criminal Court, so you must spend tens of thosand$ to sue in Civil Court. What type of history do they have, riding around in brand new cars that you bought them: raping a man's wife on a lonely road after he has been beaten and cuffed; beating homeless veterans to death as a gang of thugs, even though few cops have ever been in the military or served in combat themselves; planting drugs and contraband for felony arrest; forcing a cavity search for not coming to a full stop at a stop sign, $10K medical expenses which the victim must pay for out-of-pocket while being humiliated in front of donut-eating and laughing cops; and on and on!All these cop shows illustrate one thing. The street cop in the US has too much power, is unregulated and unsupervised. And this is the way the N*w W*rld O*rder P*lice St*te wants it! Six months in an academy learning statutes and how to beat and shoot innocent citizens to death does not qualify a moron for 'officer' status. A Bachelor's degree is required to be officer-level! In other words, uneducated morons with guns control your life, steal your money and make your life a living hell to satisfy their sick egoes. Police forces in the US have to be completly revamped and have 90% of their power usurped!

I'm usually not a fan of the big hits.I'm finally watching ""Due South"" courtesy of Netflix. It revolves around the adventures of a police odd couple, a Mountie (descended about equally from Dudley-Do-Right and Sgt. Preston) and a cynical, not-so-very-by-the-book Chicago Detective.  The Mountie, Constable Benton Frazer, has a ""pet"" wolf. It sleeps in his bed, while Frazier sleeps in a pristine boy scout bed-roll, on the floor.I have to admit, I've just completed viewing the first year. At first, DS had me genre-confused, then I realized it's cheerfully playing the field. In the beginning, it seemed to be old time T.V. with a happy-ending, clearly never meant to be taken too seriously, targeting the ""Murder She Wrote"" demographic + Canadian jokes. Some episodes were just plain witty, and with a wry, dry, off-kilter Pythonlike humor. Others, with street kids and dogs, were sort of corny, with plots which strained even this old lady's credulity. Nevertheless, the opening shot of Constable Frazier marching into Chicago-- with his boots, backpack and animal companion wolf--is poignant. He's the classic Stranger in a Strange Land, an (only slightly saner) Don Quixote RCMP.I'm getting soft in my old age, but it's uplifting to enter--if only through the suspension of belief required by theater--a reality where honesty, knowledge, industry, creative thinking and optimism carry the day. I've grown to LOVE these characters, especially, (and just like all the women who populate this series) I love the Constable! This guy needs lots and lots of cookies--and a good woman to take care of him.And just as I'm thinking that, Blam! The ""Victoria's Secret"" episodes! Suddenly, it's all romantic tragedy, with bare skin on Hudson Bay Blankets, and an old flame almost getting the Constable killed. I was floored by the change, but definitely will continue watching.Due South is highly character driven, and the plots sometimes suffer, particularly as the '90's are getting to be ancient history, but I've got a weakness for charming off-beat characters. ""Due South"" has plenty, as well as the wolf sidekick, who is by turns trusty police dog and/or obnoxious roommate. There are ghosts, too, more often than ""Hamlet.""BTW, wonder if the video quality earlier reviews have mentioned result from some scenes (apparently) being shot in video tape instead of film. Sometimes the cutting together of these very different textures and photographic capability give the viewer an unpleasant jolt. However, I'm no expert, so could be wrong about this being the reason for ""poor quality"" others have spoken of.Anyway--I really am enjoying this series!

1157343,AF8WQMZUUZJ9D,B0017KP8Y0,"Kamila Z. Miller ""explores the word woods""","[4, 6]","For those of you who haven't seen a single episode of Due South and need some clues as to what kind of show this is, I'll give it a shot.  I wouldn't be surprised if this show was cancelled simply because it doesn't fit neatly into a particular category and would be hard to pitch to execs.My teenaged kids' favorite character is Diefenbaker, the beautiful dog you see on the cover.  He's deaf, supposedly can read lips, and has engaging storylines that center around him.  Working with animals in a production is extremely difficult to do.  I'm impressed by Diefenbaker and always look forward to his presence in the show.  He's described as wolf that decided to live with Fraser (the mountie) and went deaf when he saved Fraser's life in a water rescue.  This is a comedy and I find it easy to set aside any quibbles with the chances of this happening, although it's my understanding that sometimes people who own sled dogs and live in the far north have wolves interact with their dogs and even become somewhat friendly toward the people if they're fed.  Diefenbaker is a big step up from the dog heroes I enjoyed as a child.  He is very much as fully realized a character as any of the other leads.My favorite character is Fraser.  I've always had a fondness for the innocent, brave and ultra-polite stereotypical image of 'Mounties' and Fraser doesn't disappoint with his sometimes comical adherence to the strict letter of the law and his rarely fallible capability to track down bad guys in any terrain.  I believe his mother was a librarian if I remember correctly, or maybe it was a grandparent.  This is the excuse the writers use to turn Fraser into a kind of living encyclopedia.  The pilot says it all as Fraser brings in the bad guy in a bad storm by sled for illegal fishing.  You have to see the show to get the punchline, and how he ends up in Chicago is a fun set up.Vecchio, Fraser's Chicago partner, is the jaded cop on the verge of being a screw-up that offsets Fraser's straight role.  He loves his car too much, loves his clothes too much and doesn't do much to fight crime until Fraser comes along.  At his heart Vecchio wants to do well but clearly hasn't an idea of how to go about it.  He's too much of an adult to have Fraser become his role model, but by their interactions and Vecchio's increasing success in crime fighting he quickly develops into a force to be reckoned with.  He's not exactly comic relief.  His role is more complex than that.  Every character, including Vecchio's sister, is comical and exaggerated in some way, but they also have a heart that we all aspire to find within ourselves that's unbreakable and untaintable.  The writers play with this idea a great deal, tempting these iconic characters to sully themselves, but they don't, and it's a beautiful thing.Fun secondary characters abound, including the ghosts of the fathers of Fraser and Vecchio.  The writers rarely miss an opportunity to make a side character make us want to laugh even as the viewer becomes engaged in the crime-solving storyline.  The crimes aren't particularly campy, nor is the crime-solving.  It's more of a dry comedy with some serious moments.  It is extremely family friendly with very limited violence, although some very young children may be concerned or disturbed about animals in danger, especially the horses/slaughterhouse episode where there are hanging carcasses and they may correctly interpret that those are meant to depict horse carcasses.I have no complaints about the quality of the DVDs themselves.

Big surprise -- it's GREAT adult entertainment, too!  Subtle wit, intelligent story lines, and meaningful character development are the mainstay of the entire series. Hilarious lines enjoy dead-pan delivery by extraordinary Canadian writer/actor/director/producer Paul Gross. In addition, this series devotes more attention to high-quality music than any other I've ever seen on American TV. It fits seamlessly with the action, either as subtle support for the story or as active accompaniment to the actors.Constable Benton Fraser is sober-as-a-judge, a Canadian Mountie with a rigid moral backbone and a disarming manner, something rather unfamiliar to big-city law enforcement in Chicago. He's smart, talented, well-read, wholesome, unassuming, kind-hearted ... and devastatingly handsome. His backwoods Yukon upbringing makes him a fish-out-of-water when he is led south in search of his father's murderer; that said, his strength of character and sweet manner make him valuable to all he encounters.His father's ghost visits Fraser regularly throughout the series, adding warm wisdom about the human condition, unexpected wacky wit that often flies under the radar, and knee-slapper belly-laughs to many episodes. Pure ridiculous fantasy, of course, but who among us is not haunted by a dead relative?I highly recommend this series; it offers many hours of entertainment value for the money. It's generally good, clean fun, but does cross the line in a few places.

Echo Bridge has compressed the episodes to such an extent that pixelation appears in every intense action scene for the first couple of seasons and pixelation almost obliterates the images for any scene with motion in seasons three and four. It's a travesty! And it's not because the show's old. I have DVDs of TV shows from the eighties that look FAR better. And Alliance Atlantis, the people releasing the Canadian version of Due South, did NOT overcompress the video so there is NO pixelation for any of the episodes, regardless of season.

I mean I actually have the software on my computer right now to make the exact same menu screen (except better, cause I'm not colorblind.) Aside from the crappy menu, they also have the first Vecchio on the disks containing the third season (when Kowalski was undercover as Vecchio and Vecchio was barely even there).Now there's also the matter of the amount of episodes per disk. For this you have to consider two things. One I paid 20 dollars for Four seasons. Two this show was produced in 1994 to 1996 for the first two seasons, and 1996 to 1999 for the last two. If you've watched reruns of old 90's shows (like the first couple seasons of X-files 1993...) then you know the quality's not great. So the first couple seasons of Due South aren't that great either, though the last two seasons are better. The haven't been enhanced, but they also only cost 20 dollars so... you get what you pay for. If you really want to hold out in case they decided to release an enhanced version you can do that. Or if you're able to buy the Canadian version (which I've heard is better) then do that. BTW the USA release of Due South has 4 seasons, the Canadian 3 (but it's the same episodes, only the third season was split in two for some reason.) Oh and don't buy Call of the Wild because it's included. In the end you get 4(USA)/3(CA) seasons, and the follow up movie. It's not enhanced, and the quality of film shows it's age. But it's only 20 dollars and how many people have bought a new movie for 20 only to hate it, or end up watch it few times before leaving it to gather dust on a shelf somewhere. At least most people buying this series already like it. In the end, I read up on the product, knew basicly what I was getting, found a price I was willing to pay from seller with a 95% or higher rating and was content with what I got even if I did exerience an urge to smack the person or persons that thought Peach was a good font color.

I was really looking forward to watching this series for the first time.  68 episodes for $30 didn't seem suspicious since I figured it's a little-known show that probably underperformed for the DVD studio in season sets, so they decided to burn off their investment in one affordable mega-set.  When I saw the first disc my blood ran ice cold:  6 TV hours on one DVD?  Okay, most TV sets won't break a 4-episode per disc limit or risk some serious image compression issues.  Fancy sets will do 2 or 3 per disc which in my opinion generates a reference quality picture.  I thumbed through the rest of the discs and would have laughed had I not broke the manufacturer's shrinkwrap, thereby making a refund impossible:  Some discs in this set contain a whopping 7 episodes!!!  I skimmed through some of the episodes on disc 1:  Despite the fact that this is an older show (pre-HD), and the image is naturally soft, there is expectedly HEAVY PIXELATION.  Whenever someone or something moves, they turn into a blob of compression.  Cars, people... in this shameful presentation, the show can't even fade out or in from black without turning into a videophile's nightmare.  Cursing, I inserted a disc with 7 episodes -- morbid curiosity at this point.  The cast can't even walk down a hall without the picture turning into a substandard digital cable parody.  I suppose the math of the issue should have occurred to me: 68 episodes divided by 11 discs = VCD quality.  Too late.

It was initially meant to be just a two-part made for TV movie, but it did well enough that it was turned into a series.  Chances are anyone who is reading this already knows the story, so I will not rehash that too much.  They did very well with the ""fish out of water"" story.  The show blended elements of comedy, drama and action perfectly.The key to the show was that it was always well acted.  Even in the last season after David Marciano left and the story became a little more campy, the acting was always great.  One thing I had forgotten was how many guest appearances were made on the show.  Leslie Nielsen was the big one, who appeared in a few different episodes.  But Ryan Phillipe and Mark Ruffalo also guest starred in very early roles for both of them.I originally thought that the show should have gone on longer, but after watching the series again from beginning to end, I think that the show went out at exactly the right time.  It told as many stories as possible, without getting extremely repetitive.  It was definitely a show that was always being kept alive.  It barely got a second season on CBS, then survived a couple more in syndication.In the end I felt it did a fine job wrapping up everyone's stories, and leaving the ""continued adventures"" to the imagination.  It was one of the best series on the air at the time.  It did not rely on gratuitous sex and violence to be entertaining.  The stories always had a point, and the acting was great.

Like other police series the show had the standard two partner cop solving cases and helping people out of their tough situations, you had the straight by the book Canadian police officer and his more laid back American detective partner with the wise-cracking mouth.  The episodes while somewhat entertaining weren't exactly great either pretty much what you expected from the episodes pretty much is what would happen at the end.  The cast were pretty good actors and actresses for their roles though sometimes they would act a little stiffly and some parts but nothing to terrible to scream about.  The set itself is pretty sturdy you have eleven dvds put into one plastic dvd case that holds all the dvds and which is pretty sturdy so you shouldn't have to worry about any of the dvds shaking off or the case breaking apart.  There aren't any extras as far as I've seen on the dvds though,  also the video while not to blurred could have used some fixing but like one reviewer said the video probably is better than the vhs version and the audio pretty clean so no complaints on that part.

Yes, the price for the complete collection is right but with the price comes poor packaging (I have received two of the complete collections--a set and a replacement for the damaged set--and in both the first disc in set came off the spindle), scratched DVDs (in the two sets about 1/4 of the discs were scratched and looked used), poor picture quality (too many episodes squeezed on to too few discs still it could be far worse), video stops and starts, audio dropouts, and horizontal lines in the picture frame at one point.If you like this series as I do and you have an all-region DVD player and the money go for the Network box set from the UK. The picture quality is far superior and so is the packaging. I have also heard excellent things about the French TF1 releases that have come out thus far.By the way I bought one of the multi volume sets at a local grocery store that will remain nameless (season one, volume 1).

He mentioned at the time that if we ever saw it on sale, maybe we should get it.  So, for his birthday in May, his comment percolated up thru my brain and I looked for it on Amazon.  I couldn't believe the price!  All this and Diefenbacker, too -  for 20 bucks???  I was gobsmacked!  I mean, this series isn't any rocket surgery as far as series go, but it's fun, innovative and filled with wonderful characters.  It's great to just take an hour's breather and enjoy the ride with this series.",5,What a deal!!,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,589,"['husband', 'had', 'introduced', 'series', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'rented', 'thru', 'Netflix', 'mentioned', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'sale', 'maybe', 'should', 'get', 'So', 'birthday', 'May', 'comment', 'percolated', 'up', 'thru', 'brain', 'looked', 'Amazon', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'price', 'Diefenbacker', 'too', '20', 'bucks', 'was', 'gobsmacked', 'mean', 'series', ""n't"", 'rocket', 'surgery', 'as', 'far', 'series', 'go', 'fun', 'innovative', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'great', 'just', 'take', 'hour', 'breather', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'series']",N/A
