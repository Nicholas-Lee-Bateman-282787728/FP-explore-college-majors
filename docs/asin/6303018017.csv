350892,AN3NLOTAEJKPQ,6303018017,"C. Baugh ""Duke Keagan""","[0, 0]","The Jazz Singer (1959) with Jerry Lewis starring was a surprise to me. I'm a long time Martin and Lewis fan but slowly lost interested with much of his solo work. It was produced as a television series, Startime on ABC, and was broadcast on October 13, 1959. I never knew Lewis had performed in this roll since the original one hour episode had never been rebroadcast, only recently being released in 2012.The Jazz SInger is a fantastic story. I think most folk think of the 1980, Neil Diamond version. The original full length motion picture was released in 1927 as an American Musical Film, starring Al Jolson. The actual screening of the film was a technical nightmare as each of Jolson's songs had their own reel and own sound plate. Crazy times back in the early days of &#34;Talkies.&#34;I was hoping to see Jerry Lewis at his best, even though his showing of the Jazz Singer was done as an early TV broadcast. I was very disappointed. Without knowing the story of Joey Rabinowitz, aka as Joey Robbins, the viewer might have difficulty catching on to the plot of a Jewish young adult who left home to make a living cracking jokes and singing jazz, instead of following in his fathers footsteps as a Jewish Cantor. About midway through the production the story plot line collapses together.Lewis' acting is sketchy at best. Lines are delivered out of time, blocking is poor even if one takes into consideration it was blocked more as a work of theatre more than for TV. Even the comedy sketches were below Lewis' level and simply not funny. I'm not sure who told Lewis he could sing a serious and dramatic song as he seemed to have a difficult time even coming close to hitting the correct notes. That said, he preformed one number accapella. Without having to stay in key with the music, it was Lewis' best number of the hour.The one strong point of the show came through the performance of Eduard Franz who played Joey's father, the Cantor. His performance as a father struggling to understand his son and failing to understand why his son would simply walk away from five generations of a family heritage, was, in my opinion, spot on and managed to carry the show.Another standout performance was done by Molly Picon who played Joeys mother. In the role of peacemaker between her stubborn husband and son, Picon's performance gave life to the frustrated Jewish mother.With all said and done, this show is just short of an hour in length. There are worse things you could with an hour of free time.  That said I would recommend taking a little extra time and watching the  Neil Diamonds version instead of this one.",2,"Jerry Lewis as the Jazz Singer (Spoilers)  NOTE: This review is automatically posted on the Danny Thomas, Jazz Singer page.",1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,2622,"['Jazz', 'Singer', '1959', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'starring', 'was', 'surprise', ""'m"", 'long', 'time', 'Martin', 'Lewis', 'fan', 'slowly', 'lost', 'interested', 'much', 'solo', 'work', 'was', 'produced', 'television', 'series', 'Startime', 'ABC', 'was', 'broadcast', 'October', '13', '1959', 'never', 'knew', 'Lewis', 'had', 'performed', 'roll', 'original', 'one', 'hour', 'episode', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'rebroadcast', 'only', 'recently', 'being', 'released', '2012.The', 'Jazz', 'SInger', 'fantastic', 'story', 'think', 'most', 'folk', 'think', '1980', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'version', 'original', 'full', 'length', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'released', '1927', 'American', 'Musical', 'Film', 'starring', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'actual', 'screening', 'film', 'was', 'technical', 'nightmare', 'Jolson', 'songs', 'had', 'own', 'reel', 'own', 'sound', 'plate', 'Crazy', 'back', 'early', 'days', '34', 'Talkies.', '34', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'best', 'even', 'showing', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'was', 'done', 'early', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'knowing', 'story', 'Joey', 'Rabinowitz', 'aka', 'Joey', 'Robbins', 'viewer', 'might', 'have', 'difficulty', 'catching', 'plot', 'Jewish', 'young', 'adult', 'who', 'left', 'home', 'make', 'living', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'singing', 'jazz', 'instead', 'following', 'fathers', 'footsteps', 'Jewish', 'Cantor', 'midway', 'production', 'story', 'plot', 'line', 'together.Lewis', 'acting', 'sketchy', 'best', 'Lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'time', 'blocking', 'poor', 'even', 'one', 'consideration', 'was', 'blocked', 'more', 'work', 'theatre', 'more', 'TV', 'Even', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'were', 'Lewis', 'level', 'simply', 'not', 'funny', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'told', 'Lewis', 'could', 'sing', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'song', 'seemed', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'even', 'coming', 'close', 'hitting', 'correct', 'notes', 'said', 'preformed', 'one', 'number', 'accapella', 'having', 'stay', 'key', 'music', 'was', 'Lewis', 'best', 'number', 'hour.The', 'one', 'strong', 'point', 'show', 'came', 'performance', 'Eduard', 'Franz', 'who', 'played', 'Joey', 'father', 'Cantor', 'performance', 'father', 'struggling', 'understand', 'son', 'failing', 'understand', 'why', 'son', 'would', 'simply', 'walk', 'away', 'five', 'generations', 'family', 'heritage', 'was', 'opinion', 'spot', 'managed', 'carry', 'show.Another', 'standout', 'performance', 'was', 'done', 'Molly', 'Picon', 'who', 'played', 'Joeys', 'mother', 'role', 'peacemaker', 'stubborn', 'husband', 'son', 'Picon', 'performance', 'gave', 'life', 'frustrated', 'Jewish', 'mother.With', 'said', 'done', 'show', 'just', 'short', 'hour', 'length', 'are', 'worse', 'things', 'could', 'hour', 'free', 'time', 'said', 'would', 'recommend', 'taking', 'little', 'extra', 'time', 'watching', 'Neil', 'Diamonds', 'version', 'instead', 'one']",Jazz Singer VHS

They make me laugh and help me forget all my troubles for just a few moments. This film  did that an more. Though the laugh wasn't there, the Jazz Singer held me spell bound from start to finish.
