Especially when talking about sitcoms this is true... full of beautiful people thin stories, and cars exploding at the drop of a hat.There are some exceptions!1> Stingray2> Miami Vice3> AirwolfOn the surface, Airwolf was a rip-off of BLUE THUNDER. With a few changes... They hired above average actors, spent GOOD money altering an actual helicopter (Bell 222, adding a second door, and the fake weapons)... and all the weapons that I remember the copter having were believable.The thing I liked most about the series was the characters. Even in the pilot, the copter was shown very little, the people were most important.Hawke had an almost empathic understanding of the `copter, he just didn't trust people.Santini was probably as good as Hawke, when he was younger. Now he is Hawke's only friend, and father figure.Archangel couldn't be trusted in or out of your sight. I liked his character because you never knew what he was going to do... or if this was the day he would try to stab the heroes in the back.The copter wasn't a gimmick to get people to watch the program like the other advanced-hardware programs (KNIGHT RIDER, STREET HAWK, BLUE THUNDER, VIPER). All these programs ended because people got bored with the gimmick... KNIGHT RIDER lasted a bit longer than the others because they kept changing the beautiful mechanic that would fix the car. AIRWOLF ended because one of the stars had a personal issue that was wrecking the shooting schedule.The only place where I think the show is lacking is the aerial combat. Even in the early 80s, it was too expensive to do good model shots, so most of the time they reused old footage of airplanes/copters exploding. Seeing the same shot over and over is one of the things that killed another Bellisario production BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.",5,Airwolf...

1022213,A1KD93LN4BHUT3,B000IONJI8,Dumb Ox,"[8, 9]","And it's not quite as good as season one.  But that's okay, it's still a worthwhile addition to an Airwolf fan's collection.  The overall quality has its moments but isn't up to the level of the first set of episodes.  Marella was taken out, only recurring in the rare guest appearance, which was too bad, since she was a great character and knew as much about Airwolf as anyone involved.  Caitlin O'Shaughnessy was a fine addition, nice and spunky, well-played by Jean Bruce Scott.  Archangel's character suffered, acting less like a suavely pleasant yet potentially dangerous spy with ambiguous loyalties and more like an ineffectual whiner.  Worst was the change in String's character from wounded loner with a fear of romantic entanglements to a man-about-town with plenty of female action.One positive note was there was a fair amount of emphasis on the story arc involving St. John Hawke when there wasn't undue focus on human interest plots. (Blame the network for interfering with Bellisario's vision for his show.) And though there were groaners like Out Of The Sky(a country singer's hubby is out to get her---who cares?), there were also great episodes, such as Moffett's Ghost, where the evil inventor of Airwolf returns as a computer virus trying to destroy his creation so nobody else gets to use it.Overall, though not as good as the first season, this DVD is a must for those interested in having the entire series done by CBS.  It does include the introduction of Caitlin's character and there's more St. John stories than the first go-round.  We recommend this as a slightly flawed but still essential part of the phenomenon that was Airwolf, and a great trip back to the best part of 80's TV.The episodes are Sweet Britches, Firestorm, Moffet's Ghost, The Truth About Holly, The Hunted, Sins of the Past, Fallen Angel, HX-1, Flight #093 Is Missing, Once A Hero, Random Target, Condemned, The American Dream, Inn at the End of the Road, Santini's Millions, Prisoner of Yesterday, Natural Born, Out of the Sky, Dambreakers, Severance Pay, Eruption, and Short Walk to Freedom.

1022215,A3A9UCRADPMCT8,B000IONJI8,James Horlan,"[1, 1]","Had the net been around back in the mid-1980's, there would have been an interesting debate on which was the better vigilante show, Airwolf or The A-Team.  Both had lots of bullets flying from former military men, rarely hitting anyone (though Airwolf had a much higher body count), characters cracking wise to lighten things up, and enough do-gooding to satisfy most viewers.Airwolf changed direction from the first season, when it was an espionage show with international intrigue.  It showcased new technology, and seemed unlike most shows on TV at the time.  But I guess the ratings weren't good enough, so the network (CBS) forced a move to more domestic situations.  This was not to the series' benefit, and it made for a lesser show, as it was always 'bad local man wants to rule over the locals', a scenario that The A-Team was already mining, and without an advanced chopper.  It led to the marginalization of Archangel (Alex Cord) and Marella (Deborah Pratt, wife the show's creator), who seemed to be in about 1/3 of the episodes, with less screen time than usual even in those.  Introduced in this season is Caitlin O'Shaughnessy (Jean Bruce Scott), who Dom and String help out in one of their vigilante missions early on, and sort of attaches herself to them.  She seems to exist to give those guys someone to talk to, and lend a female presence.  Scott isn't bad in the role, poorly written though it is, and she's attractive without being too obviously eye candy.Ernest Borgnine as Dom is in a lot of ways the heart of the show, the cranky old man who's the only one String seems to listen to.  His cranky old man tendencies get a little too much screen time, he's the main character in more episodes than you'd think, but it's always nice to see Borgnine in action.  The same cannot be said for Jan-Michael Vincent, who has three facial expressions:  A goofy smile that's seldom used......studied indifference (the dominant one).....and a scowl, which befits this most hostile of characters.  Vincent's struggles with drugs and alcohol are now a minor legend, but it's hard to tell here if that's the issue here, or that he's just not a good actor.  It's certainly worth noting that nothing he's done other than this and Winds of War (for which he was not hired back for the sequel) have endured.The villains and damsels in distress were almost uniformly bad, as were the local heroes who needed String's and Dom's help.  And I mean bad, not that the dialogue they were given was Shakespeare to begin with.  The contrast between the acting of then and now is  rather jarring, almost 30 years later.Airwolf isn't a bad show, but you can understand how it only lasted three seasons (sorry, like most fans I don't count the fourth season on USA Network).  If only it had stuck to the original premise.....Three Stars.",3,A Product of Its Time,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,2830,"['Had', 'net', 'been', 'around', 'back', 'mid-1980', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'debate', 'was', 'better', 'vigilante', 'show', 'Airwolf', 'A-Team', 'Both', 'had', 'lots', 'bullets', 'flying', 'former', 'military', 'men', 'rarely', 'hitting', 'anyone', 'Airwolf', 'had', 'much', 'higher', 'body', 'count', 'characters', 'cracking', 'wise', 'lighten', 'things', 'up', 'enough', 'do-gooding', 'satisfy', 'most', 'viewers.Airwolf', 'changed', 'direction', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'was', 'espionage', 'show', 'international', 'intrigue', 'showcased', 'new', 'technology', 'seemed', 'most', 'shows', 'TV', 'time', 'guess', 'ratings', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'network', 'CBS', 'forced', 'move', 'more', 'domestic', 'situations', 'was', 'not', 'series', 'benefit', 'made', 'lesser', 'show', 'was', 'always', ""'bad"", 'local', 'man', 'rule', 'locals', 'scenario', 'A-Team', 'was', 'already', 'mining', 'advanced', 'chopper', 'led', 'marginalization', 'Archangel', 'Alex', 'Cord', 'Marella', 'Deborah', 'Pratt', 'wife', 'show', 'creator', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'about', '1/3', 'episodes', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'usual', 'even', 'Introduced', 'season', 'Caitlin', ""O'Shaughnessy"", 'Jean', 'Bruce', 'Scott', 'who', 'Dom', 'String', 'help', 'out', 'one', 'vigilante', 'missions', 'early', 'sort', 'attaches', 'exist', 'give', 'guys', 'someone', 'talk', 'lend', 'female', 'presence', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'bad', 'role', 'poorly', 'written', 'attractive', 'being', 'too', 'obviously', 'eye', 'candy.Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Dom', 'lot', 'ways', 'heart', 'show', 'cranky', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'String', 'listen', 'cranky', 'old', 'man', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'main', 'character', 'more', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'think', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Borgnine', 'action', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'who', 'three', 'facial', 'expressions', 'goofy', 'smile', 'seldom', 'used', 'studied', 'indifference', 'dominant', 'one', '..and', 'scowl', 'most', 'hostile', 'characters', 'Vincent', 'struggles', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'are', 'now', 'minor', 'legend', 'hard', 'tell', 'here', 'issue', 'here', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'actor', 'certainly', 'worth', 'noting', 'nothing', 'done', 'other', 'Winds', 'War', 'was', 'not', 'hired', 'back', 'sequel', 'have', 'endured.The', 'villains', 'damsels', 'distress', 'were', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'bad', 'were', 'local', 'heroes', 'who', 'needed', 'String', 'Dom', 'help', 'mean', 'bad', 'not', 'dialogue', 'were', 'given', 'was', 'Shakespeare', 'begin', 'contrast', 'acting', 'then', 'now', 'rather', 'jarring', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'later.Airwolf', ""n't"", 'bad', 'show', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'only', 'lasted', 'three', 'seasons', 'sorry', 'most', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'fourth', 'season', 'USA', 'Network', 'only', 'had', 'stuck', 'original', 'premise', '..Three', 'Stars']",Airwolf: Season Two

1022221,A3C2HQOFO37TFN,B000IONJI8,Pamela Walters,"[3, 3]","At the start of this season I was really getting into this show. The stories seemed to really start the season off with a bang, and kept you going for at least 5-10 episodes, and then something happened. In my opinion they dropped the ball. The season started off well, and then took a dip, and kind of went back to the boring style of episodes like in season 1. I find it really hard to sit through some of these episodes. (The American Dream is a good example of a really boring episode.)The only episode I remember being decent from around the middle of the season is Santini's Millions, and then it takes another kind of nosedive. I heard the reason they changed mid season like this is because they wanted to present the show in a more hip fashion, kind of like Knight Rider, so they changed the direction of the show. I always preferred the episodes that focus on things that happen in the U.S., rather than the boring episodes that take place in other countries. I realize it's a military type show, and all that, but I think the stories are more relatable on american soil. Like the first episode of season 2. It is nothing short of amazing.Since the first half of the season was so great, I give it a 3 out of 5 because it is better than season 1, but not quite a solid season by any means.

1022227,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000IONJI8,Taheen Lopez,"[3, 3]","This 1984-85 Season of AIRWOLF DVD is awesome along with the fact that this Superchopper series 2nd Season is even better than the 1st Season, since this season of this show is more upgraded, more sophisticated and has more action than the First Season does along with the fact that AIRWOLF's 1st Season was only an abbreviated season, since this show didn't premiere on CBS until Sunday January 22, 1984.In addition to that, the Second Season is when Jean Bruce-Scott joins the case & crew as Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent) and Dom's(Ernest Borgnine)spunky fellow pilot(Caitlyn O'Shaunessy), which made the episodes of AIRWOLF more interesting and enjoyable than the First Season along with AIRWOLF showing off more features too.Therefore, I think this is the second best season of AIRWOLF that made its debut in January of 1984, but the Third Season is even better than the first 2 seasons throughout AIRWOLFs whole 2 1/2-year run on CBS, despite the fact that this show didn't last very long and started getting a drop in ratings during this 1984-1985 Season which resulted in AIRWOLF's cancellation in the Spring of 1986 which was when KNIGHT RIDER was cancelled too.It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this 1984-1985 Season like*James Whitmore, Jr. in the ""Sweet Britches"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & McCall's ornery fellow officer (Det. Bernie Terwilliger)on the police drama HUNTER*Jared Martin in the ""Santinis Millions"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS*Mills Watson in the ""Eruption"" episode after his co-starring days as the doofus Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO*Lance LeGault playing a crooked Sheriff in the ""Sweet Britches"" episode during his co-starring days as the ornery Army nemesis(Col. Decker) on THE A-TEAM & his co-starring days as Magnum's disgruntled Navy nemesis(Col.Green)on MAGNUM, P.I.*Jennifer Aniston's father(John Aniston) in the ""Short Walk To Freedom"" episode before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES*Anne Lockhart in the ""Random Target"" episode after her co-starring days as Sheba BATTLESTAR GALACTICA*Nick Campbell in the episodes ""Prisoners Of Yesterday"" and ""The Inn At The End Of The Road"" after his earlier co-starring days as THE HITCHHIKER, which was of course before Nick Campbell was replaced by Page Fletcher*Jeffrey McKay during his co-starring days as Magnum's gullible Navy buddy(Mac Reynolds)*Noble Willingham in the ""Natural Born"" episode before his co-starring days on the police drama WALKER TEXAS RANGER*Martin Milner in the ""Severance Pay"" episode after his co-starring days on ADAM-12*David Graf in the ""Sweet Britches"" episode during his co-starring days in the POLICE ACAMEDY flicks*Arte Johnson in the ""Severance Pay"" episode after his co-starring days on the GONG SHOWI also couldn't help finding it intriguing how Jared Martin and Joseph Ruskin not only both guest starred in the ""Santini's Millions"" episode of AIRWOLF, but they coincidentally also happened to both guest star in the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode of KNIGHT RIDER that same season.Therefore, we used to be able to watch Super-Autos every weekend back in the Winter of '85 since ABC had STREET HAWK on Friday nights at 9PM, CBS had AIRWOLF on Saturday nights at 9PM, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER on Sunday nights at 8PM which all coincidentally just happened to be Universal owned TV shows that were all filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood on top of that even though the supercar series KNIGHT RIDER, this superchopper series AIRWOLF, & the short-lived supercycle series STREET HAWK were all in competition with one another & despite the fact that STREET HAWK had stole a lot of viewers away from AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER, but then STREET HAWK hit a speed-bump after only 9 weeks since it didn't get the ratings ABC wanted which was probably due to the fact that STREET HAWK was too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF since it gave viewers too much of the same thing every week, giving us too much competition, & redundancy since they all premiered too soon after one another on top of that since KNIGHT RIDER debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1982, AIRWOLF debuted on CBS in the Winter of 1984, and then lastly STREET HAWK debuted on ABC in the Winter of 1985, but had tanked & cancelled in the Spring of 1985 with no 2nd Season underway.This season also reminds me of the days when CBS's motto was ""CBS: We've Got The Touch"", since that was their slogan on CBS from September of 1983 thru August of 1986. The only problem I have with this AIRWOLF-SEASON 2 DVD is for some reason it freezes and skips on the ""Santinis Millions"" episode and the episodes didn't come with a brief summary of each episode displaying their original air-dates unlike the AIRWOLF-SEASON 1 DVD.For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1984-1985 Season episodes on CBS was9/22/84-SWEET
