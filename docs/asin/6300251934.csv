230149,A17NB397AH144H,6300251934,ACS,"[4, 5]","""Dr. Gore"" is the second, but thankfully the last, film by director and lead actor J. G. ""Pat"" Patterson. (Mr. Patterson reportedly died a year or so after this movie was made. I'm guessing it was from lung cancer since he smoked about 100 cigarettes in this 80-min. feature.) It's the story of a ""doctor"" who loses his wife and then decides to build the ""perfect mate."" Like a modern-day Dr. Frankenstein, he goes out and kills half a dozen or so women and then sews together the parts that he likes best. The resulting ""perfect mate"" is a blond, well-endowed, empty-headed, bimbo.Everything about this film is poorly done: the direction is bad, the camera work is awful, the editing stinks and the acting is abysmal. Don't get me wrong: I'm a huge B-movie fan. But this one is so technically inept that it's more annoying than entertaining. ""Dr. Gore"" isn't one of those so-bad-it's-good kind of movies; it's just plain bad. Apparently, the only reason this movie was made was so that middle-aged, bad-comb-over-guy Patterson could make out with a bunch of young chicks.Admittedly, there are a few (unintentionally) funny moments. At one point, you hear someone knocking at the door. The doctor says to his hunchbacked assistant, Gregory, ""Go get that, it might be the door."" Later in the film, the doctor is in prison (although no one bothers to explain why he's there). Anyway, he's talking to a female prison employee who is scrubbing the floor. The camera angle shifts and suddenly you see the movie clapboard (you know, that big black and white wooden thing with chalk writing all over it that they clap together before every scene to synchronize the picture with the sound). Somehow, they just forgot to edit that part out! There's also a full-length country-music ""video"" in the middle of the film. It's supposed to be part of a nightclub scene, but it's so long and so poorly integrated that you'd swear it got there by accident. I'll bet that one of the investors was a frustrated singer and told Patterson that unless he let him sing in the movie, he wouldn't give him any money.One positive thing can be said about this Something Weird DVD: it's got a ton of special features. There are no less than three featurettes (all three of them are completely unwatchable -- avoid them), an alternate opening sequence (which is interesting because it has a special introduction by Herschell Gordon Lewis, the ""Godfather of Gore""), a dozen or so trailers and more. The trailers are particularly entertaining. Most of them are for nudie movies from the late ' 50s early '60s and are positively hilarious.One out of five stars.",1,Amateurish exploitation,1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,2629,"['Dr.', 'Gore', 'second', 'thankfully', 'last', 'film', 'director', 'lead', 'actor', 'J.', 'G.', 'Pat', 'Patterson', 'Mr.', 'Patterson', 'reportedly', 'died', 'year', 'so', 'movie', 'was', 'made', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'lung', 'cancer', 'smoked', '100', 'cigarettes', '80-min', 'feature', 'story', 'doctor', 'who', 'wife', 'then', 'build', 'perfect', 'mate', 'modern-day', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', 'out', 'dozen', 'so', 'women', 'then', 'sews', 'together', 'parts', 'best', 'resulting', 'perfect', 'mate', 'blond', 'well-endowed', 'empty-headed', 'bimbo.Everything', 'film', 'poorly', 'done', 'direction', 'bad', 'camera', 'work', 'awful', 'editing', 'stinks', 'acting', 'abysmal', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'huge', 'B-movie', 'fan', 'one', 'so', 'technically', 'inept', 'more', 'annoying', 'entertaining', 'Dr.', 'Gore', ""n't"", 'one', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'kind', 'movies', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Apparently', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'so', 'middle-aged', 'bad-comb-over-guy', 'Patterson', 'could', 'make', 'out', 'bunch', 'young', 'chicks.Admittedly', 'are', 'few', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'moments', 'one', 'point', 'hear', 'someone', 'knocking', 'door', 'doctor', 'hunchbacked', 'assistant', 'Gregory', 'Go', 'get', 'might', 'be', 'door', 'Later', 'film', 'doctor', 'prison', 'one', 'explain', 'why', 'there', 'Anyway', 'talking', 'female', 'prison', 'employee', 'who', 'scrubbing', 'floor', 'camera', 'angle', 'shifts', 'suddenly', 'see', 'movie', 'clapboard', 'know', 'big', 'black', 'white', 'wooden', 'thing', 'chalk', 'writing', 'clap', 'together', 'before', 'scene', 'synchronize', 'picture', 'sound', 'Somehow', 'just', 'forgot', 'edit', 'part', 'out', 'also', 'full-length', 'country-music', 'video', 'middle', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'part', 'nightclub', 'scene', 'so', 'long', 'so', 'poorly', 'integrated', ""'d"", 'swear', 'got', 'there', 'accident', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'one', 'investors', 'was', 'frustrated', 'singer', 'told', 'Patterson', 'let', 'sing', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'money.One', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Something', 'Weird', 'DVD', 'got', 'ton', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'less', 'three', 'featurettes', 'three', 'are', 'completely', 'unwatchable', 'avoid', 'alternate', 'opening', 'sequence', 'interesting', 'special', 'introduction', 'Herschell', 'Gordon', 'Lewis', 'Godfather', 'Gore', 'dozen', 'so', 'trailers', 'more', 'trailers', 'are', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'Most', 'are', 'nudie', 'movies', 'late', '50s', 'early', ""'60s"", 'are', 'positively', 'hilarious.One', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

If not, then leave it.I loved it and was laughing out loud through the entire film and will force lots of unwillings to sit through a full viewing.The ""commentary"" by Jeffrey Hogue is of little value. He speaks of his career and not about the movie at all, I love the commentary tracks to most films but this is of little interest.Second feature ""How to make a doll"" is a total loser, not even entertaining grade B.

Its exactly the sort of movie you either expect or deserve if you're shopping the Something Weird catalog.A bonus feature titled ""How to Build a Doll"" is a lot worse but also a lot weirder.  Its hard to sit through.  Actors who can't deliver lines are given pages of clever dialogue.  There's a scene near the end where everyone is just sitting on a couch giggling.  The whole point of this movie should have been to get as many hot babes as possible in the frame for as long as possible wearing as little as possible.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to rely on the strength of their script, which may not have even existed.Perhaps the most interesting feature on the disk is a short subject called Maniac Hospital.  Its like a VD propaganda film on acid, or steroids, or both.  There's really no way to describe it except to say its a little like the Wizard of Oz without really being anything like the Wizard of Oz.Then there's even more stuff on this disk, including an Easter egg for a movie called Axe, which is a movie that wanted you to think of it as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only with an axe instead of a chainsaw.",2,Its something weird all right,1039996800,"12 16, 2002",2002,1256,"['Dr.', 'Gore', 'one', 'weird', 'movies', 'where', 'scenes', 'fake', 'gore', 'are', 'interspersed', 'tender', 'country', 'songs', 'love', 'lost', 'exactly', 'sort', 'movie', 'either', 'expect', 'deserve', ""'re"", 'shopping', 'Something', 'Weird', 'catalog.A', 'bonus', 'feature', 'titled', 'How', 'Build', 'Doll', 'lot', 'worse', 'also', 'lot', 'weirder', 'hard', 'sit', 'Actors', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'lines', 'are', 'given', 'pages', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'everyone', 'just', 'sitting', 'couch', 'giggling', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'get', 'many', 'hot', 'babes', 'possible', 'frame', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'wearing', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'Unfortunately', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'rely', 'strength', 'script', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'most', 'interesting', 'feature', 'disk', 'short', 'subject', 'called', 'Maniac', 'Hospital', 'VD', 'propaganda', 'film', 'acid', 'steroids', 'really', 'way', 'describe', 'say', 'little', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'really', 'being', 'anything', 'Wizard', 'Oz.Then', 'even', 'more', 'stuff', 'disk', 'including', 'Easter', 'egg', 'movie', 'called', 'Axe', 'movie', 'wanted', 'think', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'only', 'axe', 'instead', 'chainsaw']",N/A
