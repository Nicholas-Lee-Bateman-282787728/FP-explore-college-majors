A gut wrenching story makes me want to vomit.In this case, that's not a bad thing.I understand that this movie came under fire for the protagonists' machinations towards revenge.  I see that and can understand that some may see the movie as supporting such actions.  Desiring revenge in something I have, over the years, become very wary of.  I feel uncomfortable when I give so much negative thought and emotion to someone.However, this is still an incredibly powerful movie.

89139,A2QA095LQPDBJD,0790729393,Ariel Escasa,"[2, 3]","If you tell me a story and make it clear from the start that it's fiction, I'll take it for what it is: fiction. But if you tell me a story and claim that it's true, and I find out that it's not true or its truth is questionable, I'll take that against you. Fair enough, I'm sure you'll agree.Given that framework, the controversy surrounding Sleepers makes rating this entry difficult. The film is based on a book (a first-person account by Lorenzo Carcaterra) that purports to be based on a true story, a claim we have to factor in. But numerous critics have thrown a huge shadow of doubt on the truthfulness of this claim, a counter-claim we also have to factor in.There is no question that Sleepers is a powerfully moving story. It draws you in and never lets you go. It works admirably hard at character development and depth. Few other films succeed at making us feel a certain compassion for two apparently cold-blooded murderers. Or understand why a priest would lie under oath. Or condone a District Attorney's breach of ethics when he takes a case with the intention of losing. Director Barry Levinson's compassionate handling of a very sensitive and complex subject matter is indeed remarkable, matched only by the ensemble cast's performances.But we have to go back to that question of veracity. Carcaterra stands by his story, and he's pretty much out on a limb alone on that. On the other hand, the critics (and we're not talking here about the literary type) are legion. That naturally makes us lean more towards the doubters' side. But can we say with absolute certainty that they're right? Or that Carcaterra is right, for that matter?The fact is, that burning question will probably continue to do just that -- burn -- for the rest of our lives. And that is unfortunate. If the book and the movie never made this ""based on a true story"" claim, I would give it five stars without batting an eyelash. But because I simply cannot go along with the school of thought that says, ""whether it's true or not is irrelevant, just enjoy the movie,"" I have to take away one star.

""Cheesy"" or ""corny"" can be substituted too. My favorite moment is when the phony actor Jason Patric takes a phony stab at The Method acting during a dinner with the phony actor Bruno Kirby until he is abruptly cut off by his co-actor's ""Hey, things are good? Life is good? Good...good."" That was that for the scene. Honestly, that's how I think of Sleepers: an all-around phony acting infused through many meaningless scenes (sort of resembling an audition for most of the actors). Really, the big names of the cast aren't necessary. Barry ""Oh, All I Do Is Make Baltimore Pictures"" Levinson clearly cannot direct. He just doesn't know how to make a sharp film; the pacing drags, and there are always degrees of phoniness throughout the picture. Take the phony narration: oh man...could the words be phonier? What do I expect from the phony who makes phony pictures about phony characters trying to make a phony statement?

This trauma follows 2 of the boys into adulthood where they enter a life of crime.

In some ways the film compliments the more contemporary film ""Mysterious Skin"" which deals with a similar theme. I will first discuss an overall assessment of the film and then return to the theme of sexual molestation and the long path to recovery from sexual molestation.As a dramatic engaging film, this product is very good. The acting of Robert DeNero, Kevin Bacon, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Brad Pitt, and Dustin Hoffman is super. DeNero is wonderful as the priest put in an ethical dilemna. Jason Patric holds the second half of the film together as the most psychologically sound of the victims. Kevin Bacon is creepy and realistic as the sadistic molester. Dustin Hoffman is a rare talent as he plays an incompetent alcoholic drug addicted second rate lawyer. Also note that the child actors were very good also. The plot is well developed and engaging, especially the division of the film into childhood and adulthood experiences. The Count of Monte Cristo by Dumas is also used as a unifying theme of imprisonment, escape, planned revenge, and redemption from pain. The cinematography was very good (notice the camera angels and techniques used on the city streets, the courtroom, and especially in the youth facility) and sound track (with serious almost tragic overtones) are first rate. Overall the film gets 5 out of 5 points.The theme of sexual molestation of children by adults is a difficult and disturbing topic. In this film, 4 boys are molested, with two emerging as angry killers and two emerging with intact emotional stability. Brad Pitt plays the young lawyer who uses the court room to unearth the sexual crimes committed by several guards in the correctional facility. Jason Patric however plays the victim with the the strongest emotional stability and who is capable of developing loving relationships and moving forward with his life. Revenge was the theme that holds the second half of the film together, carefully plotted and executed by two of the victims, impulsively and self defeating by the other two.A fine film worthy of your time.",5,Entertaining well made film about a difficult subject,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,2225,"['film', 'topic', 'continually', 'culture', 'sexual', 'molestation', 'children', 'adults', 'authority', 'positions', 'ways', 'film', 'more', 'contemporary', 'film', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'similar', 'theme', 'will', 'first', 'discuss', 'overall', 'assessment', 'film', 'then', 'return', 'theme', 'sexual', 'molestation', 'long', 'path', 'recovery', 'sexual', 'molestation.As', 'dramatic', 'engaging', 'film', 'product', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'Robert', 'DeNero', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'super', 'DeNero', 'wonderful', 'priest', 'put', 'ethical', 'dilemna', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'together', 'most', 'psychologically', 'sound', 'victims', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'creepy', 'realistic', 'sadistic', 'molester', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'rare', 'talent', 'incompetent', 'alcoholic', 'drug', 'addicted', 'second', 'rate', 'lawyer', 'Also', 'note', 'child', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'plot', 'well', 'developed', 'engaging', 'especially', 'division', 'film', 'childhood', 'adulthood', 'experiences', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'Dumas', 'also', 'used', 'unifying', 'theme', 'imprisonment', 'escape', 'planned', 'revenge', 'redemption', 'pain', 'cinematography', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'camera', 'angels', 'techniques', 'used', 'city', 'streets', 'courtroom', 'especially', 'youth', 'facility', 'sound', 'track', 'serious', 'almost', 'tragic', 'overtones', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'film', '5', '5', 'points.The', 'theme', 'sexual', 'molestation', 'children', 'adults', 'difficult', 'disturbing', 'topic', 'film', '4', 'boys', 'are', 'molested', 'two', 'emerging', 'angry', 'killers', 'two', 'emerging', 'intact', 'emotional', 'stability', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'young', 'lawyer', 'who', 'court', 'room', 'unearth', 'sexual', 'crimes', 'committed', 'several', 'guards', 'correctional', 'facility', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'however', 'victim', 'strongest', 'emotional', 'stability', 'who', 'capable', 'developing', 'loving', 'relationships', 'moving', 'forward', 'life', 'Revenge', 'was', 'theme', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'together', 'carefully', 'plotted', 'executed', 'two', 'victims', 'impulsively', 'defeating', 'other', 'two.A', 'fine', 'film', 'worthy', 'time']",N/A

Adapted from Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel/memoir of the same name, `Sleepers' claims to be an accounting of Lorenzo's life as a child, being sent to a juvenile detention home at a young age with three friends and being repeatedly abused by the guards until their release.Ten years later and these four friends are reunited with the guard that ruined their lives.  Sean Nokes (Bacon) shows up at a local diner where two of the molested, Tommy (Crudup) and John (Eldard), are taking a couple drinks.  After recognizing this man they kill him in cold blood, and of course are then arrested for it.  That's when the other two boys, Lorenzo (Patrick) and Michael (Pitt) decide to make their case.  Michael is a high profile prosecutor who takes the case AGAINST his friends in an attempt to turn the tables on the detention center the boys where abused in.What makes this film so compelling is the brilliant acting on the parts of Pitt and Patrick as well as Bacon in all his sadistic pleasure, but to me it was De Niro who plays the boys priest Father Bobby and serves as their only real friend who moved me the most.  You could see all the pain in his eyes as he heard what these boys, these boys whom he loved and cared about, had to go through.  Minnie Driver also delivered a stand out performance as long time friend and lover to the boys, as well as Dustin Hoffman (always brilliant) as the accused shabby lawyer.True or false, `Sleepers' is still a gripping courtroom drama that is sure to have you at the edge of your seat for its entire duration.",4,True or false...it's still worth the time...,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,1775,"['debate', 'not', 'film', 'actual', 'events', 'really', 'moot', 'even', 'events', 'portrayed', 'were', 'as', 'faux', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'would', 'still', 'hold', 'very', 'powerful', 'message', 'hands', 'Adapted', 'Lorenzo', 'Carcaterra', 'novel/memoir', 'same', 'name', 'Sleepers', 'claims', 'be', 'accounting', 'Lorenzo', 'life', 'child', 'being', 'sent', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'home', 'young', 'age', 'three', 'friends', 'being', 'repeatedly', 'abused', 'guards', 'release.Ten', 'years', 'later', 'four', 'friends', 'are', 'reunited', 'guard', 'ruined', 'lives', 'Sean', 'Nokes', 'Bacon', 'up', 'local', 'diner', 'where', 'two', 'molested', 'Tommy', 'Crudup', 'John', 'Eldard', 'are', 'taking', 'couple', 'drinks', 'recognizing', 'man', 'kill', 'cold', 'blood', 'course', 'are', 'then', 'arrested', 'when', 'other', 'two', 'boys', 'Lorenzo', 'Patrick', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'decide', 'make', 'case', 'Michael', 'high', 'profile', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'case', 'AGAINST', 'friends', 'attempt', 'turn', 'tables', 'detention', 'center', 'boys', 'where', 'abused', 'in.What', 'film', 'so', 'compelling', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'parts', 'Pitt', 'Patrick', 'as', 'well', 'Bacon', 'sadistic', 'pleasure', 'was', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'boys', 'priest', 'Father', 'Bobby', 'serves', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'who', 'moved', 'most', 'could', 'see', 'pain', 'eyes', 'heard', 'what', 'boys', 'boys', 'whom', 'loved', 'cared', 'had', 'go', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'also', 'delivered', 'stand', 'out', 'performance', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'lover', 'boys', 'as', 'well', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'always', 'brilliant', 'accused', 'shabby', 'lawyer.True', 'false', 'Sleepers', 'still', 'gripping', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'sure', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'duration']",N/A

Maloney""","[3, 4]","A lot of controversy surrounded &quot;Sleepers&quot; regarding the author's claim that his work was based on a true story which actually took place in New York's Hell Kitchen in the 1960's. The New York State Juvenile  Authority and the New York City Police Department deny the story's  veracity.Nonetheless, the story is outstanding. Set in the 60's, it  involves the lives of four boys and a girl from different families living  in Hell's Kitchen on the West Side of Manhattan.The story does a fine  job or portraying the fact that these kids don't come from one of the  &quot;finer&quot; New York neighborhoods of the day. They are the kids of  single parents and hardworking blue collar folks. There is too much  drinking at home, domestic disputes, and other glimpses of a hard life  growing up.The story kicks into high gear as the kids pass summer days  sunning and getting into hijinks. One of their antics is to cheat the hot  dog vendor out of his hot dogs. They do this once too often and a serious  chase ensues where the hotdog vendor pursues one of the kids for blocks  after he's been ripped off. The other three boys decide to move his hot dog  stand so he'll have to look for it when he returns.Tragedy occurs when  there is a serious mishap with the hotdog cart that ends up hurting a  man.The boys are charged with stealing the hot dog cart and associated  charges. They are sent to juvenile training school for rehabiliation  together.The Training School is hellish. Guards led by a mean, hateful  Kevin Bacon; the kids are subjected to humiliation, solitary confinement,  verbal abuse as well as physical and sexual abuse. Bacon does a masterful  job of portraying a truly horrible human being who enjoys abusing  kids.Years later the boys get a chance for payback against the guards.The story steps up from here as Brad Pitt (now an attorney) masterminds  the punishment of the four guards who abused the boys most.His tactics  are effective. Yet, each of these men remain psychologically marked as a  result of the destroyed innocence of their youth.Robert DeNiro does an  excellent job as the local parish priest who looks out for the boys.

Years later, two of them (Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup), now adults and full-fledged thugs, murder one of their tormentors (Kevin Bacon).  This provides an opportunity for the other two, one a public prosecutor (Brad Pitt) and the other a fledgling newspaperman (Jason Patric), to acquit their friends and bring down the other guilty guards.Superficially, this is a mostly entertaining, though overlong, film.  Morally, however, the film is a mess.  Early on, it appears to be critical of the culture of violence in which these events occur.  The moral compass of the neighborhood is the scrupulously honest Father Bobby (Robert DeNiro).  Yet, when the time for payback arrives, the Mafia mentality takes over, murder is approved, and Father Bobby perjures himself to provide an alibi for ""his boys,"" who are guilty of worse crimes than the abuse that was committed against them.  I believe that these characters (with the exception of Father Bobby) might behave this way and a perceptive film about such choices could have been made, but such a film would require some evidence that either the characters or the filmmakers were aware of the moral complexity involved.  Instead, Father Bobby leaves the witness stand and disappears conveniently from the film, so we never see how he justifies himself.  The reunion of the four friends at the end of the film has an uninterrupted tone of triumph and happiness, without a hint of reflection, regret, or awareness that any moral compromises were made.",2,Morally bankrupt,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,1654,"['Four', 'friends', 'violent', 'New', 'York', 'neighborhood', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'are', 'sent', 'reformatory', 'school', 'where', 'are', 'beaten', 'sexually', 'abused', 'guards', 'Years', 'later', 'two', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'now', 'adults', 'full-fledged', 'thugs', 'murder', 'one', 'tormentors', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'opportunity', 'other', 'two', 'one', 'public', 'prosecutor', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'other', 'fledgling', 'newspaperman', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'acquit', 'friends', 'bring', 'down', 'other', 'guilty', 'guards.Superficially', 'mostly', 'entertaining', 'overlong', 'film', 'Morally', 'however', 'film', 'mess', 'Early', 'be', 'critical', 'culture', 'violence', 'events', 'occur', 'moral', 'compass', 'neighborhood', 'scrupulously', 'honest', 'Father', 'Bobby', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'when', 'time', 'payback', 'arrives', 'Mafia', 'mentality', 'over', 'murder', 'approved', 'Father', 'Bobby', 'provide', 'alibi', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'guilty', 'worse', 'crimes', 'abuse', 'was', 'committed', 'believe', 'characters', 'exception', 'Father', 'Bobby', 'might', 'behave', 'way', 'perceptive', 'film', 'such', 'choices', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'would', 'require', 'evidence', 'characters', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'aware', 'moral', 'complexity', 'involved', 'Instead', 'Father', 'Bobby', 'witness', 'stand', 'disappears', 'conveniently', 'film', 'never', 'see', 'how', 'reunion', 'four', 'friends', 'end', 'film', 'uninterrupted', 'tone', 'triumph', 'happiness', 'hint', 'reflection', 'regret', 'awareness', 'moral', 'compromises', 'were', 'made']",N/A

In the case of Sleepers, the lodged complaint circles not around the brutal treatment of four boys at the center of the film, but the  perjury-laced testimony of the priest (played by Robert DeNiro) who tries  to protect them.The authenticity of Lorenzo Carcaterra's bestseller has  continued to be a question, but the compelling nature of the story--true or  not--is undeniable. The wise guy buddies grow up fast in Hell's Kitchen in  the '60s. They do the altar boy thing one minute and peer at naked ice  capade dancers through a broken window the next. It's like an Angel's with  Dirty Faces remake without Cagney or an electric chair.The rough center  of the story comes in the shadowy form of Wilkinson, a dank reform school  where the spirits of the precocious teens are crushed on a relentless wheel  of physical and verbal abuse. The leader of the pack is a sicko guard named  Nokes (Kevin Bacon). The kids do their time and twelve years later two of  them grease Nokes in a restaurant. Michael (Brad Pitt), an assistant D.A.,  and Lorenzo (Jason Patric), a reporter, conspire to get their buds off the  hook in an eye for an eye trade-off.They cash in all their favors, throw  an alcoholic lawyer played by Dustin Hoffman on the other side of the case,  and wreak revenge on their past.But despite the star-studded lineup,  Sleepers doesn't pack quite the emotional wallop it could have.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[31, 36]","With a gripping story, augmented by the moral and ethical dilemmas of a lawyer, a journalist, and a priest, Barry Levinson's SLEEPERS is heart-pounding drama at its finest.  Set in New York's Hell's Kitchen--with all of its subsequent turbulence and socioeconomic dysfunction--this film tells the story of four boys, four lifelong pals, who are sadistically brutalized in a reform school and carry the scars into their adult lives.It comes as no surprise that two of the four embark on a problematic life of crime; it comes as even less of a surprise that when a former reform school guard is seen eating in a diner the two men extract a brutal and bloody revenge.At this point SLEEPERS embarks on a breathless course of twists and turns, with one underlying, consistent theme:  the unbroken bond of friendship.  With their friends on trial for murder, the other two men, a prosecuting attorney (Brad Pitt) and a journalist (Jason Patric) put their careers and reputations on the line to exonerate the defendants--who are indeed guilty of murder--and to malign the former guard who was killed.  The stage is set for courtroom drama that is literally spellbinding.Kevin Bacon, Jason Patric, Brad Pitt, and Minnie Driver are exceptional in this film, but the cast is trumped by two &quot;oldtimers,&quot; Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro.  Hoffman plays an alcoholic defense attorney in over his head for the trial, while De Niro--as a loving priest who has been a father figure to all four of the boys--faces a titanic decision as he is called to testify as an important witness.  The acting is compelling and absorbing, and so is the story.  SLEEPERS is about as good as a drama can get.--D.

Moreover, I would argue that it is a consequence of not recognizing that the story in the film is about assault and battery, and the terrorizing--not ""abuse""-- of children (and others), that the makers and stars of the film were unsure how to present the story in more poignant and dramatic fashion.Despite one's position (""abuse"" versus assault/terrorism) on the subject mater of the story, the script and theme of the film--which really is more about how to ""deal"" with the effects of such actions--can only be described as cynical and pessimistic at best; and, more realistically, illegal/morally corrupt and vigilantism.  Because, as far as I am concerned, what the film is about, when the movie ends, is that revenge is sweeter than either the victim's health or justice, let alone how to realistically deal with the problem.  That is, the film condones the notion that the ""best"" thing one can do as a victim is break the law themselves, exacting revenge on their perpetrators while maintaining the illusion they and others see: that nothing ever happened to them.  The failure of such an approach is alluded to at the end of the movie--two of the boys (victims) get killed acting out just as they were treated, and the two other boys become (depressed) lost and lonely in society.  BUT I question how evident this is to most viewers.  Indeed, my gut reaction to the film the first time I watched it was: ""Yeah, that's how you deal with sicko child predators: kill them!""  AND this is the movies ""undoing,"" while it is also what gives the film a feel good dramatic effect on viewers.As a society, most people ""feel good"" when revenge--especially when concealed in the imagery of ""justice""--is the conclusion of the story.  So what if the prosecutor broke numerous laws to lose the case; that a priest committed perjury (which is acceptable, apparently, since the president can do so without consequences); two ""hardened"" criminals--who essentially admitted to killing the guard (Kevin Bacon's character)--are found ""innocent"" of murder; and another man/guard is killed ""street"" style by a drug lord?  In a society that refuses to acknowledge the true nature of ""abuse,"" and therefore coddles said criminals (as well as allowing so called ""abuse"" to be used as an excuse for the victim's own criminal actions), people--myself at times, as well--need an outlet to feel like something is being done.Movies (and other media) such as ""Sleepers"" provide that relief; and in doing so, I think, conceive a dramatic and satisfying exposure to one of our greatest threats to social order, in the movie ""Sleepers.""  As such, this allows the viewer to empathize with the characters and theme of ""Sleeper,"" and come away satisfied or really liking the movie.  I think ""Sleepers"" also allows the viewer to (incorrectly) believe that the problem is not as bad as it is, and that it is being dealt with by others.  As such, ""Sleepers"" essentially provides the viewer a sense that ""Yes, 'abuse' is out there, but it is being dealt with by ""someone"" else; so who cares?""However, it also keeps the viewer from asking more important questions:  Does such revenge help the victims?  Does such revenge help prevent the problem?  Why are we as individuals so willing to view such violence and crime as nothing more than ""abuse?""  How is child assault and terrorism (aka ""abuse"") effecting other people, in addition to the victims and perpetrators--that is, to what degree has this problem disrupted/destroyed families, relationships, jobs, beliefs, and other socio-cultural aspects of our lives?I purchased this movie based on two factors: the amazing cast and other reviews praising how well the film was made, glossing over the subject matter.  Unfortunately, the cast--for the most part--gave mediocre performances relative to their past portrayals in other films; although, collectively, they did well enough to keep the drama moving forward.  As such, ""Sleepers"" is an average movie, with an amazing cast of stars who, on the face of it, give solid performances; but really just ""walk"" their way through their scenes, being themselves.  But, then again, an average performance by Robert Deniro or Dustin Hoffman is often superior to a really great performance my lesser actors.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.

Moye,"[5, 7]","I found this to be an incredibly compelling film, although it took a long time for me to get past the central brutality, and watch it a second and third time.  By then, I was hooked.The underlying story is a troubling but familiar one, about young boys growing up in the Hell's Kitchen section of New York.  Their lives take them on a huge turn when heir ""innocent"" prank goes bad.  For their crime, they are sentenced to a year in a reform school for troubled boys, ostensibly to keep them from advancing into a life of crime.Unfortunately, the institution is populated by not only brutally sadistic fellow inmates but also with guards who take the boys' remaining innocence and traumatize them.  The boys leave, butyears later their paths bring them back across a terrible reminder of their past.  The remainder of the film is the turning of the law enforcement system, in which the system itself is shown for what it was, and the way it impacts these individuals.One of the bit players, Frank Medrano as a neighborhood tough guy has the most timeless line of the film: ""On the street, justice got no price. She's blind where the judge sits. But she ain't blind out here. Out here, the ... got eyes.""Fabulous performances, even if they were critically not acclaimed.  Robert DiNero is terrific as a local priest who never gives up hope for ""his boys"", even to the point of ommitting perjury for them.  Kevin Bacon IS the sadistic guard, and there is real joy at seeing his comeuppance.  Brad Pitt and Dustin Hoffman appear as dueling lawyers in the courtroom scene, each giving marvelous and understated performances.  Ron Eldard steals his scenes as one of the abused boys, all grown up, who serendipitously discovering Bacon in a restaurant has the best line of the movie when Bacon asks him what he wants.  His retort, (which I will not quote, to avoid giving away theending) delivered with deadly quiet, and is nothing short of chilling.As another reviewer said, this film is stunning with its insight of boys' institution's and its horrors.  It makes one wonder if anyone can ever survive the institution which was supposed to be an alternative to jail for kids.Growing up in New York around the same time as the protagonists, and getting into just a tad of trouble myself, I kept thinking ""There but for the Grace of God go I"".That alone was enough to make me say ""Damn!

I also read the book and the movie pretty much follows the book almost verbatim...so watching the movie is good enough although some of the detail is missing from the horrendous abuse suffered by some of the main characters. The acting by all is great and well worth the time and effort to see.Reading some of the reviews though is quite disturbing. IT'S A MOVIE BASED ON A NOVEL BASED ON SOME EXPERIENCES IN THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR! When words like homophobic get thrown around about some aspects of this movie when there is no reference or even the slightest hint to anything to do with homosexuality it makes one wonder as to the sensitivity level of some viewers. I'm not a  psychiatrist but in my humble opinion if this movie makes someone who sees it think that one of the messages being conveyed is that it's ok to murder a serial child rapist because the bad guy must have some homosexual tendencies that obviously soar above the depraved evil of the acts committed then that viewer may be a little too sensitive to offer an objective review. This is not intended to offend anyone just to help some realize that an objective review of this movie should be just that without inserting perceived slights and imagined motives.Reform schools like prisons are not nice places and terrible things happen there for all sorts of reasons. The justice system is not perfect and is manipulated almost on a daily basis. Just look at the O J Simpson and Robert Blake murder trials for some of the most famous cases. So all is within the realm of possibilities.In any case if you're going to watch this movie with an open mind and your sensitivity meter turned down a bit I think you will enjoy a well written and well acted movie, especially if you're from the Hell's Kitchen area of NYC.",5,"AN EXCELLENT ""MOVIE""",1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,1922,"['have', 'watched', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'really', 'enjoy', 'themes', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'revenge', 'retribution', 'justice', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'also', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'book', 'almost', 'verbatim', 'so', 'watching', 'movie', 'good', 'enough', 'detail', 'missing', 'horrendous', 'abuse', 'suffered', 'main', 'characters', 'acting', 'great', 'well', 'time', 'effort', 'see.Reading', 'reviews', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'IT', 'A', 'MOVIE', 'BASED', 'ON', 'A', 'NOVEL', 'BASED', 'ON', 'SOME', 'EXPERIENCES', 'IN', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'THE', 'AUTHOR', 'When', 'words', 'homophobic', 'get', 'thrown', 'around', 'aspects', 'movie', 'when', 'reference', 'even', 'slightest', 'hint', 'anything', 'do', 'homosexuality', 'one', 'wonder', 'sensitivity', 'level', 'viewers', ""'m"", 'not', 'psychiatrist', 'humble', 'opinion', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'think', 'one', 'messages', 'being', 'conveyed', 'ok', 'murder', 'serial', 'child', 'rapist', 'bad', 'guy', 'must', 'have', 'homosexual', 'tendencies', 'obviously', 'soar', 'depraved', 'evil', 'acts', 'committed', 'then', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'sensitive', 'offer', 'objective', 'review', 'not', 'intended', 'offend', 'anyone', 'just', 'help', 'realize', 'objective', 'review', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'inserting', 'perceived', 'slights', 'imagined', 'motives.Reform', 'schools', 'prisons', 'are', 'not', 'nice', 'places', 'terrible', 'things', 'happen', 'there', 'sorts', 'reasons', 'justice', 'system', 'not', 'perfect', 'manipulated', 'almost', 'daily', 'basis', 'Just', 'look', 'O', 'J', 'Simpson', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'murder', 'trials', 'most', 'famous', 'cases', 'realm', 'possibilities.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'sensitivity', 'meter', 'turned', 'down', 'bit', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'especially', ""'re"", 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'area', 'NYC']",N/A

Sleepers is a good name for this since it becomes so tedious.This is an all-male sleeze fest despite the token mop-head Driver, who didn't belong in it.

The second half of this sleeze-fest is about the trial in which one of the boys, who has become a lawyer (Brad the Pits) perverts the law with the help of a lying priest to get the killers off.This movie tries to show there is no absolute truth, the end justifies the means, and ""proves"" the theories of relative values taught in schools.

It was directed by Barry Levinson and had a great cast that included Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, and Kevin Bacon:  all of which are favorites of mine.  As good as their performances are  though they really do not have much screen time.  In fact, no one really  does since the film deals with flashbacks and present day material.  It's  about a group of kids in Hell's Kitchen that pull a prank that turns out to  be deadly and are sent to reform school where they are abused by sadistic  guards (Kevin Bacon's darkest performance).  Two of the kids find him years  later and murder him and then the other two fix thet trial.  Robert DeNiro  gives a really good performance as a priest who is very close to the kids.  It's a really dark film though and it seems to drag at parts.  The begining  seemed to open up like all the New York gangster films open up with  childhood flashbacks that are starting to all be the same.  It basically  has the same opening as &quot;Bronx Tale&quot; or &quot;GoodFellas&quot;  yet it is much longer.  Though Levinson's directing is top notch as are the  performances.

Four young boys in the 1960s are put into the &quot;Wilkinson Home For Boys&quot;  where they suffer abuse and torture at the hands of four guards. All  because of a dumb prank. The boys then make a pact to keep silent about the  suffering they endured.Several years later two of the boys, now violent  gang leaders, walk into a restaurant where they recognize one of the guards  from the reform school: the brutal Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon). He now looks  like a stubbly, long-haired loser and fails to recognize the two men who  walk up to his table. The memories come back to him when he's told who the  two men are.

The cast on the cover draws you in right from the start but then there's the movie. Absolutely brilliant.Right from the start, you know that it's going to be sad, disturbing and one hell of a powerful movie. The plot centers around four boys that are sent to the Wilkenson Home forBoys after a prank in Hell's Kitchen goes horribly wrong. But the guards there are perverts that abuse them, in so many ways.This ruins their entire lives. But when they have a chance for revenge latter on in life, they take it and a court room trial comes next to determine their fates.The movie is gripping, powerful and haunting. What makes it even more scary is that its' based on a book written by one of the 4 boys, based on reality.The acting is great with Robert DeNiro stealing the show! Kevin Bacon is creepy and Dustin Hoffman adds a lot!Ultimately, this movie is one of my favorites of all time. The DVD treatment is lousy though. There are 2 side to the DVD that splits the movie in 2! What the heck?But you can get it for a low price and you'll really enjoy it even though it's so hard to watch. It makes your mind think a lot...and makes you wonder what you would do in their position. Would you kill for revenge?

I picked it up recently at the movie store and boy it gives new meaning to the term &quot;renter&quot;.Let me begin by stating that the film was mildly entertaining, thus the two stars I have given it. However, the rest is down hill.The overriding problem with this movie is the contrived plot. This could have been a serious drama, with excellent actors, about horendous child abuse, but it was reduced to a second rate revenge plot, that wasn't even convincing.  The court scenes were pure non-sense, no Judge in his right mind would allow a trial to unfold like that, I haven't seen a confession from a witness like that since the old Perry Mason episodes on TV, did anyone else want to yell at this guy and remind him of his 5th amendment rights.  I'm not even American and I could have figured that one out!The young actors were very good, but the story was weak. Some have described the movie as brutal yet what we actually are presented with is a lot of voice over and flashing around. I agree with one other reviewer that a much more compelling and realistic movie concerning institutional abuse was the Boy's of St. Vincent. In that film we feel the victims pain, see the crushed lives and see justice done in a court room, but not in some contrived plot.Deniro's character also troubled me.  I like Deniro a lot but I was not convinced that this priest would throw away all of his ethics and lie to protect a murderer in this revenge as morality play.  Perhaps I could have been convinced but this movie did not convince me that this faithful priest would participate in this crime.The actual DVD is also a disappointment with a double sided format that needs to be flipped half way through.

89224,A1THRE1N60I1L5,0790729393,"infj_I_am ""alicekinnian5""","[2, 2]","This movie is a movie about the negative and positive sides of friendship; on the negative side, we see a relatively &#34;clean&#34; guard at the correctional institution the children are sent to part-take in atrocities with his friend, fellow prison guard leader Nokes, and later initially defend Nokes even posthumously in the trial of the boys who took his life, simply out of a sense of brotherly bond; we understand the basis for the guards' camaraderie and fraternity to be the worst - the systematic humiliation and torture of young, vulnerable lives in their care. Antithetically, we see the positive side of friendship and human action later in the movie in the bonds between the victims themselves, and also those of the entire community, which bands around the children later in life, each character magnanimously offering all they can to help restore some sense of vindication to the injured, now grown, children. This is epitomized in the sacrifice of the priest, who violates his entire belief system &#34;as a good father would&#34; - for his &#34;sons&#34; and commits perjury.The film is graceful, but horrifically sad. Unlike some of the negative reviewers, I did not have a problem with the revenge portion of this film; to me, the only detriment was that it was not vengeful enough. Rather than the expedient execution of the pedophilic animals passing for human beings, I would really have enjoyed watching them get tortured in a slower, more satisfying and brutal way (gunshots were too merciful for them). My only thought is that perhaps doing so would have had more of a cathartic effect on the viewer, feeling more that &#34;justice was done&#34; than the author wanted to permit.Because therein lies the true haunting nature of this tale. Even though the boys summarily execute one of the sadistic guards, and help destroy the lives of the rest, &#34;it's not enough&#34;. They remain broken, sleeping with the light on, forever traumatized by their past; some cannot even achieve sexual intimacy, while others have lost more than their sexual innocence, but have resorted to a life of crime - an uncertain outcome had they not been so brutalized in their youth - leaving a power-imbalance that they perhaps then tried to rectify the rest of their lives.I know some of the negative reviewers walked away with a sense that &#34;justice is being done&#34; and so these pedophilic problems were therefore &#34;trivialized&#34; in their impression of the movie - because &#34;someone out there is doing something about them, so why care?&#34; I think only if you imagine that killing the slime presented in the movie were compensatory justice enough for the absolute permanent and horrific abuse demonstrated in the movie - could you arrive to that conclusion.For me, it was a tragedy from start to finish. I did not enjoy going mentally to the places this film took me too - the basement with the ill lighting, where the abuse was going on, with the background conversation on the children's mother and all they held sacred. These things will remain seared into my mind, just as though they were real events. Just as the touching scene when the boy looks back in the moonlight on his palm, and remembers joyfully playing with a hose and diving into the water in absolute childish innocence with his friends. It's poignantly, even if terribly, portrayed.I know the film does try to give the victims some sense of emotional victory in that, they see how while their abusers showed the worst side of humanity - antipathy and cruelty - the same extreme was reversed and presented in the actions of the priest, who self-sacrificially gave everything he could out of love and compassion - giving them perhaps the only thing in their lives as a powerful example of the &#34;best of humanity&#34;. Still, I feel, it's not enough.This film is therefore permanently a sad horror story, and it makes one want to hide from society as a whole, seeing how vile it can be.",5,Ineffably Sad,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,3980,"['movie', 'movie', 'negative', 'positive', 'sides', 'friendship', 'negative', 'side', 'see', 'relatively', '34', 'clean', '34', 'guard', 'correctional', 'institution', 'children', 'are', 'sent', 'part-take', 'atrocities', 'friend', 'fellow', 'prison', 'guard', 'leader', 'Nokes', 'later', 'initially', 'defend', 'Nokes', 'even', 'posthumously', 'trial', 'boys', 'who', 'took', 'life', 'simply', 'sense', 'brotherly', 'bond', 'understand', 'basis', 'guards', 'camaraderie', 'fraternity', 'be', 'worst', 'systematic', 'humiliation', 'torture', 'young', 'vulnerable', 'lives', 'care', 'Antithetically', 'see', 'positive', 'side', 'friendship', 'human', 'action', 'later', 'movie', 'bonds', 'victims', 'also', 'entire', 'community', 'children', 'later', 'life', 'character', 'magnanimously', 'offering', 'can', 'help', 'restore', 'sense', 'vindication', 'injured', 'now', 'grown', 'children', 'epitomized', 'sacrifice', 'priest', 'who', 'entire', 'belief', 'system', '34', 'good', 'father', 'would', '34', '34', 'sons', '34', 'perjury.The', 'film', 'graceful', 'horrifically', 'sad', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'revenge', 'portion', 'film', 'only', 'detriment', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'vengeful', 'enough', 'Rather', 'expedient', 'execution', 'pedophilic', 'animals', 'passing', 'human', 'beings', 'would', 'really', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'get', 'tortured', 'slower', 'more', 'satisfying', 'brutal', 'way', 'gunshots', 'were', 'too', 'merciful', 'only', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'cathartic', 'effect', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'more', '34', 'justice', 'was', 'done', '34', 'author', 'wanted', 'permit.Because', 'therein', 'true', 'haunting', 'nature', 'tale', 'Even', 'boys', 'summarily', 'execute', 'one', 'sadistic', 'guards', 'help', 'destroy', 'lives', 'rest', '34', 'not', 'enough', '34', 'remain', 'broken', 'sleeping', 'light', 'forever', 'traumatized', 'past', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'achieve', 'sexual', 'intimacy', 'others', 'have', 'lost', 'more', 'sexual', 'innocence', 'have', 'resorted', 'life', 'crime', 'uncertain', 'outcome', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'brutalized', 'youth', 'leaving', 'power-imbalance', 'perhaps', 'then', 'tried', 'rectify', 'rest', 'lives.I', 'know', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'walked', 'away', 'sense', '34', 'justice', 'being', 'done', '34', 'pedophilic', 'problems', 'were', 'therefore', '34', 'trivialized', '34', 'impression', 'movie', '34', 'someone', 'doing', 'something', 'so', 'why', 'care', '34', 'think', 'only', 'imagine', 'killing', 'slime', 'presented', 'movie', 'were', 'compensatory', 'justice', 'enough', 'absolute', 'permanent', 'horrific', 'abuse', 'demonstrated', 'movie', 'could', 'arrive', 'conclusion.For', 'was', 'tragedy', 'start', 'finish', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'going', 'mentally', 'places', 'film', 'took', 'too', 'basement', 'ill', 'lighting', 'where', 'abuse', 'was', 'going', 'background', 'conversation', 'children', 'mother', 'held', 'sacred', 'things', 'will', 'remain', 'seared', 'mind', 'just', 'were', 'real', 'events', 'Just', 'touching', 'scene', 'when', 'boy', 'back', 'moonlight', 'palm', 'remembers', 'joyfully', 'playing', 'hose', 'diving', 'water', 'absolute', 'childish', 'innocence', 'friends', 'poignantly', 'even', 'terribly', 'portrayed.I', 'know', 'film', 'try', 'give', 'victims', 'sense', 'emotional', 'victory', 'see', 'how', 'abusers', 'showed', 'worst', 'side', 'humanity', 'antipathy', 'cruelty', 'same', 'extreme', 'was', 'reversed', 'presented', 'actions', 'priest', 'who', 'self-sacrificially', 'gave', 'everything', 'could', 'love', 'compassion', 'giving', 'perhaps', 'only', 'thing', 'lives', 'powerful', 'example', '34', 'best', 'humanity', '34', 'Still', 'feel', 'not', 'enough.This', 'film', 'therefore', 'permanently', 'sad', 'horror', 'story', 'one', 'want', 'hide', 'society', 'whole', 'seeing', 'how', 'can', 'be']",N/A

89228,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0790729393,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[10, 17]","This film is a masterpiece. It starts with a vision of children in Hell's Kitchen, a deprived neighborhood of New York City in the sixties, where four boys, deeply religious or at least deeply influenced by religion and a priest, one day sink into a prank that turns criminal. They destroy the  cart of a hotdog vendor, a Greek man who is working hard to bring his  family to the US, and by doing so cause severe injuries to an innocent man  who is crushed by the cart. They are sent to a boys' institution. This film  shows how some young guards or wardens take advantage of the kids to give  way to their sadistic violence and their perverted peadophiliac sexual  drives. It is hell and not reformation, the hell of rape, beating,  torturing, sexual assault in all possible forms. That is the first  dimension of the film. The second dimension is revealed by the fact that  two of those four boys recognize the worst of these guards in a restaurant  one night (twenty or so years later) and just kill him on the spur of the  moment and out of cold blood. The other two boys will organize their  defense, with the help of some older people of the community and the trial  will be rigged by the prosecutor who is one of them and a lawyer hired to  go along with the setup. The trial becomes then a full denunciation of the  hell those kids have lived in, through the counter-examination of a  prosecuting witness, one of the two particularly vicious guards, a good  friend of the one who was killed. This witness will later be killed by some  black people, because the band of guards he belonged to managed to kill the  brother of a black artist because he stood in their way and tried to  prevent the  torturing . This is the second level of the film. The third  level comes with the search, by the fourth friend and the girl who was  associated to their group, for a witness to give them a perfect alibi on  the night of the murder. They find that witness in the person of the priest  who had been their close adviser and religious friend all along. He swears  on the Bible to tell the truth, but he lies skillfully and unquestionably  to give them the alibi they need to be acquitted. But he does not really  lie, in the eyes of God, because for him the condemnation of such hellish  boys' institutions is more important than the freedom of the two boys. He  saves the boys (close to thirty by then) to force public opinion and  justice to look into those institutions, thanks to his priestly authority.  This reveals that in life you never have to choose between good and evil,  the truth and a lie. You have to choose most of the time between two evils,  two lies, and you have to ponder in your soul and mind, in your human and  religious responsibility, to know which evil and which lie are worse and  then decide to support the least evil and the least vicious lie, and then  your  lying  is between you and your soul, between you and your ethics,  between you and your God, if you believe in God. This level is absolutely  superbly done. Finally the film is in a way pessimistic about society that  can only move on from lesser lie to lesser lie, from lesser evil to lesser  evil. Society improves because the lesser lies and evils are chosen by the  men and women who have some kind of humane and humanistic inspiration,  based on personal ethics or on their religious beliefs.

89229,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,0790729393,James Morris,"[10, 44]","Before I begin, let me state that in no way do I condone child abuse nor do I excuse adults who sexually victimize children.  But neither do I condone vigilante-style justice.  This author of the book and the makers of this film seem to be of the opinion that sexual predators deserve to die a violent death, and that their killers should be allowed to get away with it.  The picture disturbed me greatly for its lack of a sense of true justice, as well as the cheap exploitation and ignorance that the script espoused.  I couldn't have been more shocked if this film had condoned mob lynching, genocide, serial killing - or child abuse, for that matter.  Morally wrong is morally wrong, and the defense of vigilantism is morally wrong.Some people continue to insist that this film is based on a ""true story"" even though the author has never presented credible evidence that it's based on fact.  Some have suggested that this was a matter of publicity seeking, but I believe that his insistence that it's based on truth is merely a way of lending its unbelievable plot line more credibility.  In this film, Kevin Bacon plays a low-life security guard in a Catholic reform school.  He and two other guards routinely victimize and intimidate their young charges, forcing themselves on teenage boys in horrendous acts of sexual abuse.  Years later, one of their victims spots the Kevin Bacon character in a restaurant and shoots him dead in cold blood.  Unfortunately, there's nothing unbelievable about the plot up to this point.  Child abusers do exist, and people do kill for revenge.  It's what follows next that is so incredible.The murder is followed by a cover-up at all levels to protect the murderer.  We are asked to believe that, in order to exonerate a killer - a GUILTY killer - a Catholic priest would lie under oath and a prosecutor would throw a capitol murder case, all on the basis of the idea that the ""fag"" child molester got what was coming to him.  Of course, most well-read and enlightened people know that sexual predators who victimize children are almost always heterosexual.  And although there is no indication in the film that the Kevin Bacon character is homosexual, many people (probably a majority of people in the US) still wrongly believe that most gay men are child abusers and most child abusers are gay.  I believe that this homophobic reasoning underlies the author's conviction that the murderer is justified in his actions; this opinion is further underscored by the fact that the mood of the film when the killer is acquitted is nothing less than celebratory.  I also believe that it's one reason why so many people think that a movie in which someone literally gets away with murder is a ""great"" film.For me, this picture was bad in a dozen different ways that I found offensive - the storyline reflects bad logic, bad judgment, bad justice, bad morals, bad lessons and bad drama.  All combined, this film annoyed me from the first scene forward.  The conclusion that murder can be justified struck me as absolutely barbarian, and I was flabbergasted at the fact that such a distinguished group of fine actors would lend their skills to this bigoted, puerile garbage.  The more I watched, the more I got the impression that this film, and the book it was based on, was created only to please homophobic adolescents.  If you are the sort of ignorant Neanderthal who would think it's OK to commit murder as long as you're blowing away a ""sexual deviate"", then this film is for you.  If you further believe that murder in the name of revenge is not only defensible but perfectly just, then you will find this film rewarding.With all the talk in the news these days about sex abuse victims coming forward to accuse their tormentors, I would have liked this film much more if the boys had simply banded together and accused Bacon and the other guards of the abuse, bringing charges in adulthood for what they suffered as adolescents.  Surely if real life victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests can find relief though genuine legal means and have their accusations believed (as so many have done) why not the teens depicted here?  A far more satisfying ending would have been for Kevin Bacon (and his cohorts, who escaped any retribution at all, including the vigilante killing) to receive exposure and proper legal punishment.",1,Homophobic Garbage,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,4365,"['begin', 'let', 'state', 'way', 'do', 'condone', 'child', 'do', 'excuse', 'adults', 'who', 'sexually', 'victimize', 'children', 'do', 'condone', 'vigilante-style', 'justice', 'author', 'book', 'makers', 'film', 'seem', 'be', 'opinion', 'sexual', 'predators', 'deserve', 'die', 'violent', 'death', 'killers', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'get', 'away', 'picture', 'disturbed', 'greatly', 'lack', 'sense', 'true', 'justice', 'as', 'well', 'cheap', 'exploitation', 'ignorance', 'script', 'espoused', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'shocked', 'film', 'had', 'condoned', 'mob', 'lynching', 'genocide', 'serial', 'killing', 'child', 'abuse', 'matter', 'Morally', 'wrong', 'morally', 'wrong', 'defense', 'vigilantism', 'morally', 'wrong.Some', 'people', 'continue', 'insist', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'even', 'author', 'never', 'presented', 'credible', 'evidence', 'based', 'fact', 'have', 'suggested', 'was', 'matter', 'publicity', 'seeking', 'believe', 'insistence', 'based', 'truth', 'merely', 'way', 'lending', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'line', 'more', 'credibility', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'low-life', 'security', 'guard', 'Catholic', 'reform', 'school', 'two', 'other', 'guards', 'routinely', 'victimize', 'intimidate', 'young', 'charges', 'forcing', 'teenage', 'boys', 'horrendous', 'acts', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'Years', 'later', 'one', 'victims', 'spots', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'restaurant', 'shoots', 'dead', 'cold', 'blood', 'Unfortunately', 'nothing', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'up', 'point', 'Child', 'abusers', 'do', 'exist', 'people', 'do', 'kill', 'revenge', 'what', 'next', 'so', 'incredible.The', 'murder', 'followed', 'cover-up', 'levels', 'protect', 'murderer', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'order', 'exonerate', 'killer', 'GUILTY', 'killer', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'would', 'lie', 'oath', 'prosecutor', 'would', 'throw', 'capitol', 'murder', 'case', 'basis', 'idea', 'fag', 'child', 'molester', 'got', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'course', 'most', 'well-read', 'enlightened', 'people', 'know', 'sexual', 'predators', 'who', 'victimize', 'children', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'heterosexual', 'indication', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'homosexual', 'many', 'people', 'probably', 'majority', 'people', 'US', 'still', 'wrongly', 'believe', 'most', 'gay', 'men', 'are', 'child', 'abusers', 'most', 'child', 'abusers', 'are', 'gay', 'believe', 'homophobic', 'reasoning', 'author', 'conviction', 'murderer', 'justified', 'actions', 'opinion', 'further', 'underscored', 'fact', 'mood', 'film', 'when', 'killer', 'acquitted', 'nothing', 'less', 'celebratory', 'also', 'believe', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'movie', 'someone', 'literally', 'away', 'murder', 'great', 'film.For', 'picture', 'was', 'bad', 'dozen', 'different', 'ways', 'found', 'offensive', 'storyline', 'bad', 'logic', 'bad', 'judgment', 'bad', 'justice', 'bad', 'morals', 'bad', 'lessons', 'bad', 'drama', 'combined', 'film', 'annoyed', 'first', 'scene', 'forward', 'conclusion', 'murder', 'can', 'be', 'justified', 'struck', 'absolutely', 'barbarian', 'was', 'flabbergasted', 'fact', 'distinguished', 'group', 'fine', 'actors', 'would', 'lend', 'skills', 'bigoted', 'puerile', 'garbage', 'more', 'watched', 'more', 'got', 'impression', 'film', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'created', 'only', 'please', 'homophobic', 'adolescents', 'are', 'sort', 'ignorant', 'Neanderthal', 'who', 'would', 'think', 'OK', 'commit', 'murder', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'blowing', 'away', 'sexual', 'deviate', 'then', 'film', 'further', 'believe', 'murder', 'name', 'revenge', 'not', 'only', 'defensible', 'perfectly', 'just', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'talk', 'news', 'days', 'sex', 'abuse', 'victims', 'coming', 'forward', 'accuse', 'tormentors', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'boys', 'had', 'simply', 'banded', 'together', 'accused', 'Bacon', 'other', 'guards', 'abuse', 'bringing', 'charges', 'adulthood', 'what', 'suffered', 'adolescents', 'Surely', 'real', 'life', 'victims', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'can', 'find', 'relief', 'genuine', 'legal', 'means', 'have', 'accusations', 'believed', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'done', 'why', 'not', 'teens', 'depicted', 'here', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'cohorts', 'who', 'escaped', 'retribution', 'including', 'vigilante', 'killing', 'receive', 'exposure', 'proper', 'legal', 'punishment']",N/A

Young boys, most of them who are Altar Boys, in Brooklyn checking out girls, snooping in on other peoples confessions, getting into plenty of mischief and basically just being kids (troublemakers but who wasnt, right) and the movie lets you get a good feel of the characters before anything dramatically changes.  It lets you grow to like the boys and lets you get a few laughs in.  The story follows Tommy, John, Michael and Lorenzo ""Shakes"" on their shinanigans until something that was meant to be a prank goes terribly wrong.  It takes them to a dark path in a youth correctional facility called ""wilkensons home for boys"" where they are beaten daily, raped daily and during one point you watch one as he is left for dead in solitary confinement.  You watch as the boys lives are forever changed.  Sleepers is 2 stories connected by the people involved in the story.  Michael grows into a successful lawyer, Shakes grows into a writer , and john and tommy turn into notoriously known hardened criminals.  One day John and Tommy find one Sean Nokes (a particulary rememberable abusive guard) and fill him from head to toe with bullets.  After years of keeping the horrors of Wilkensons a secret to both friends and family, including their best friend Carol (grown up carol played by Mimi Driver, shes AMAZING in this film) and their life long friend and mentor Father Bobby (Robert Deniro).  When John and Tommy are convicted of the murder of sean nokes lorenzo and michael are left with a painful decision, let their friends be possibly put to death or get help, help which will require telling their story.

In a nutshell, the story involves a childhood prank gone wrong, reform school guards gone sadistic and revenge taken fifteen years later by the boys, grown to manhood. I read Lorenzo Caracaterra's book (which was touted as a true story, but later shown to be no such thing, but still a good read) and here is one case where the movie is better than the book -- by far. The movie is tightly scripted, and although it may, at 2 1/2 hours, seem long, you will not notice the passage of time. The cast demonstrates from the very outset what fine acting is all about. To single out any one performer may not do justice to the entire cast, but Robert DeNiro is superb in the role of the parish priest, who becomes conflicted by his religious beliefs and his wish to help &quot;his boys&quot;, grown to adulthood. Although the subject matter involving the reform school guards' sadistic abuse of four boys is troublesome, this is outstanding film making.

It chronicles the life of four boys growing up in ""Hell's Kitchen"", New York in the 1960s. It is told through the eyes of one of the boys, ""Shakes"" (Joe Perrino). Hell's Kitchen was a very rough place to grow up. However, a strict code of honour existed, and crimes against the person were not tolerated. A central character in this human drama was the parish priest, Father Bobby (Robert De Niro), a no-nonsense rough-and-ready representative of God.The four boys - Shakes, Michael , John and Thomas - are inseparable, and they all get up to the usual adolescent hijinks, until one day something goes horribly wrong and they find themselves sentenced to incarceration at the Wilkinson Home for Boys. The Home is a brutal place, with physical, mental and sexual abuse almost a matter of routine, particularly by a foursome of guards headed by Nokes (Kevin Bacon).Their time passes, and the four are released. They grow up, but their lives are forever damaged. One day, the adult John and Thomas happen across Nokes in a bar, a seemingly perfect setup for revenge.Sleepers will disturb you.

Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few tears.

89264,AFOK05KDCHSHL,0790729393,Libretio,"[116, 128]","SLEEPERS(USA - 1996)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSBy virtue of its all-star cast, handsome production values and solemn subject matter, Barry Levinson's SLEEPERS was clearly intended as a Major Motion Picture from the outset. Based on the harrowing true-life bestseller by journalist Lorenzo Carcaterra - first published in 1995 - book and film describe the appalling fate of four Hell's Kitchen kids (played as children by Joe Perrino, Brad Renfro, Geoffrey Wigdor and Jonathan Tucker) who, in 1967, were sentenced to confinement in the 'Wilkinson Home for Boys' following a near-fatal accident involving a hot dog vending machine which they had stolen as a prank. Inside the reformatory, all four boys are sexually and emotionally abused by a group of sadistic guards led by the sinister Nokes (Kevin Bacon at his slimiest). More than a decade later, traumatized by their experiences, two of the now grown-up boys (Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup) corner Nokes unexpectedly in a local diner and murder him in cold blood. The other members of the group - one a prosecuting attorney (Brad Pitt), the other an aspiring writer and journalist (Jason Patric) - formulate a daring plan to have their friends acquitted, expiose the reformatory's dark secrets, and take revenge on their abusers...Such an extraordinary tale was always going to be controversial, and so it proved. Upon release, book and film drew immediate fire from critics who accused author and filmmakers of embellishment and exaggeration, since no records could be found to prove that the trial depicted in the film ever took place within the Manhattan district, or that the Wilkinson Home for Boys ever existed - even though Carcaterra's book (and Levinson's script) makes it clear that most of the names, dates and locations have been changed or fictionalized to protect those involved, and that the records of all children held in institutions like Wilkinson are routinely deleted after seven years. Further scandal ensued when the movie ignited protests from those who believed the story drew unfortunate parallels between pedophilia and homosexuality, thereby reinforcing the worst kind of homophobic stereotype. The point is certainly valid, given Hollywood's shameful mistreatment of gay themes and characters over the years, but SLEEPERS doesn't seek to draw any kind of parallels, unconsciously or otherwise, merely to recreate events described in Carcaterra's book. Besides, monsters are monsters, whoever their victims may be.As a movie, SLEEPERS is competent, briskly paced, and beautifully acted by a dream cast of old pro's (including Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman in key roles) and a new generation of rising stars. It's an ensemble piece, and the lack of grandstanding - in favor of narrative momentum - is admirable. But while the film is consistently intelligent and engaging, it's drawbacks are significant: The kids are terrific, especially Perrino, but the adults are burdened by the gravity of the subject matter, and Patric's sombre narration seems a little too laidback at times, lacking warmth or even genuine emotion, while John Williams' rambling score clashes resolutely with the film's epic visual sweep. Also, for obvious reasons, the moviemakers were unable to depict the kind of sexual atrocities outlined in the original book, with unfortunate consequences: Here, Nokes' murder seems more like the result of a petulant outburst by a couple of thugs, rather than the inevitable outcome of horrendous physical abuse. And during the subsequent trial, it defies belief that the prosecution's key witness - a former guard at Wilkinson - would incriminate himself so readily on the stand, as depicted here. That said, however, the movie is still a worthwhile entry, but the book is better.",4,Solemn drama gets the all-star treatment,1018224000,"04 8, 2002",2002,3831,"['SLEEPERS', 'USA', '1996', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1', 'Super', '35', 'Theatrical', 'soundtracks', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '/', 'DTS', '/', 'SDDSBy', 'virtue', 'all-star', 'cast', 'handsome', 'production', 'values', 'solemn', 'subject', 'matter', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'SLEEPERS', 'was', 'clearly', 'intended', 'Major', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'outset', 'Based', 'harrowing', 'true-life', 'bestseller', 'journalist', 'Lorenzo', 'Carcaterra', 'first', 'published', '1995', 'book', 'film', 'describe', 'appalling', 'fate', 'four', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'kids', 'played', 'children', 'Joe', 'Perrino', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'Geoffrey', 'Wigdor', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'who', '1967', 'were', 'sentenced', 'confinement', ""'Wilkinson"", 'Home', 'Boys', 'following', 'near-fatal', 'accident', 'involving', 'hot', 'dog', 'vending', 'machine', 'had', 'stolen', 'prank', 'reformatory', 'four', 'boys', 'are', 'sexually', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'group', 'sadistic', 'guards', 'led', 'sinister', 'Nokes', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'slimiest', 'More', 'decade', 'later', 'traumatized', 'experiences', 'two', 'now', 'grown-up', 'boys', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'corner', 'Nokes', 'unexpectedly', 'local', 'diner', 'murder', 'cold', 'blood', 'other', 'members', 'group', 'one', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'other', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'journalist', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'formulate', 'daring', 'plan', 'have', 'friends', 'acquitted', 'expiose', 'reformatory', 'dark', 'secrets', 'take', 'revenge', 'abusers', 'extraordinary', 'tale', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'controversial', 'so', 'proved', 'release', 'book', 'film', 'drew', 'immediate', 'fire', 'critics', 'who', 'accused', 'author', 'filmmakers', 'embellishment', 'exaggeration', 'records', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'prove', 'trial', 'depicted', 'film', 'ever', 'took', 'place', 'Manhattan', 'district', 'Wilkinson', 'Home', 'Boys', 'ever', 'existed', 'even', 'Carcaterra', 'book', 'Levinson', 'script', 'clear', 'most', 'names', 'dates', 'locations', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'fictionalized', 'protect', 'involved', 'records', 'children', 'held', 'institutions', 'Wilkinson', 'are', 'routinely', 'deleted', 'seven', 'years', 'Further', 'scandal', 'ensued', 'when', 'movie', 'ignited', 'protests', 'who', 'believed', 'story', 'drew', 'unfortunate', 'parallels', 'pedophilia', 'homosexuality', 'thereby', 'reinforcing', 'worst', 'kind', 'homophobic', 'stereotype', 'point', 'certainly', 'valid', 'given', 'Hollywood', 'shameful', 'mistreatment', 'gay', 'themes', 'characters', 'years', 'SLEEPERS', ""n't"", 'seek', 'draw', 'kind', 'parallels', 'unconsciously', 'otherwise', 'merely', 'recreate', 'events', 'described', 'Carcaterra', 'book', 'Besides', 'monsters', 'are', 'monsters', 'whoever', 'victims', 'may', 'be.As', 'movie', 'SLEEPERS', 'competent', 'briskly', 'paced', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'dream', 'cast', 'old', 'pro', 'including', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'key', 'roles', 'new', 'generation', 'rising', 'stars', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'lack', 'grandstanding', 'favor', 'narrative', 'momentum', 'admirable', 'film', 'consistently', 'intelligent', 'engaging', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'significant', 'kids', 'are', 'terrific', 'especially', 'Perrino', 'adults', 'are', 'burdened', 'gravity', 'subject', 'matter', 'Patric', 'sombre', 'narration', 'little', 'too', 'laidback', 'times', 'lacking', 'warmth', 'even', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'John', 'Williams', 'rambling', 'score', 'clashes', 'resolutely', 'film', 'epic', 'visual', 'sweep', 'Also', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'moviemakers', 'were', 'unable', 'depict', 'kind', 'sexual', 'atrocities', 'outlined', 'original', 'book', 'unfortunate', 'consequences', 'Here', 'Nokes', 'murder', 'more', 'result', 'petulant', 'outburst', 'couple', 'thugs', 'rather', 'inevitable', 'outcome', 'horrendous', 'physical', 'abuse', 'subsequent', 'trial', 'belief', 'prosecution', 'key', 'witness', 'former', 'guard', 'Wilkinson', 'would', 'incriminate', 'so', 'readily', 'stand', 'depicted', 'here', 'said', 'however', 'movie', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'entry', 'book', 'better']",N/A

The beginning of the film is set in 1967 and they are happy-go-lucky, yet somewhat careless and unthinking with some of their pranks.  They are always looking for some excitement and one day their prank changes their lives forever.  When playing games to get free hot dogs, a vendor's cart unexpectedly is set loose down subway stairs and a man is killed.  The boys are given a ""lenient"" sentence to serve at the Wilkinson School for Boys, since Father Bobby (Robert De Niro), the neighborhood priest puts in a good word for them.  The home turns out to be a nightmare where they are raped and tortured by four guards.  Noles (Kevin Bacon) is the worst and the ringleader of the group.Fifteen years later, the boys, now men, Shakes (Jason Patrick), Michael (Brad Pitt)l, Tommy (Billy Crudrup), and John (Ron Edard) come together under the same judicial system that was supposed to protect them, but failed.  They are still dealing with the memories and psychological issues surrounding the tortures and sadistic rapes.  Tommy and John are now criminals and they happen to see Noles at a local bar.  Noles is now a security guard eating by himself, so Tommy and John shoot him in front of a few patrons and leave the bar, soon to be arrested and brought to trial.Shakes is now a newspaper reporter and Michael is a lawyer with the district attorneys office.  They want to save their two childhood friends, while keeping the secret of their friendship and times at Wilkerson together.An alcoholic lawyer (Dustin Hoffman) from Hell's Kitchen is hired to prosecute the case.

89283,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0790729393,Michael Butts,"[2, 3]","SLEEPERS is a difficult movie to watch, but one cannot deny its impact.  Allegedly based on a true story, Lorenzo Carcaterra's tale was finally discredited and found to be bogus.  While this lessens the impact somewhat, director Barry Levinson has assembled a brilliant cast and the story catches you from the start and never lets up.  A tragic accident that springs from a boyish prank lands four boys in a detention home where they are brutalized by four of the guards.  The movie shifts to 1983, where the boys are now young men.  Two of them have turned to a life of violent crime, one is a minion at a newspaper office and the other is now a district attorney.  When a chance for revenge (a strong theme in the movie) occurs, the story becomes a combination of courtroom drama and behind the scenes corruption.  You'll find yourself questioning the actions of some of the characters and how they achieve ""justice,"" but you can't deny its forceful conclusion.  The cast is marvelous:  the young boys (particularly Joseph Perrino and Brad Renfro) are superb, in difficult roles; Robert DeNiro is wonderful as the boys' priest friend; Dustin Hoffman in a smaller role is great as the alcoholic lawyer who defends the boys; Vittorio Gassman is very effective as the gentle mob lawyer who pulls his strings; Minnie Driver shines as the boys' childhood friend all grown up and who loves them all; Kevin Bacon is absolutely astonishingly chilling as the head guard; Terry Kinney gives a solid performance as the other head guard; and of course, the adult boys are brilliant:  Jason Patric as laidback Shakes; Brad Pitt as the attorney; and Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup as the accused murderers.

While the incidents that take place are never witnessed by the viewer, they are implied, but are necessary for the foundation of the whole movie. Whether this story is true or not, the storyline is gripping and is a good follow up to the novel 'A safe place' which would have also made a good movie. The all star cast is what will entice most viewers. With the like of Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Jason Patric and Bruno Kirby - it is hard not to be impressed by each and everyone of their performances. Kevin Bacon is outstanding as a sadistic guard at a juvenile detention center.The story revolves around four boys growing up in Hells kitchen and the first half of the movie focuses on them growing up and doing their time in Wilkinsons home for boys. It is then after this we fast forward 13 years when they have all grown up and fate will have them facing their demons for the first time. Barry Levinson directs a powerful drama with an excellent music score, great dialogue and excellent pictures. The sound is also good in 5:1 surround.

The story, whether or not it is factual, is stunning.  You won't forget it.  I do warn any sensitive types that there are scenes that you might not want to see.  I stopped watching it after the intense scenes of brutality in the boys' correctional institution.  However, in a few days I returned to see how it would end, and I'm glad I did.Robert DeNiro underplays his role beautifully, portraying the most sympathetic and hunky priest since Bing Crosby.  Dustin Hoffman, whom I often dislike, came through with an almost comic performance.  It wasn't supposed to be, and perhaps Hoffman overplayed it a little.

89315,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0790729393,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[8, 15]","Sleepers purports to tell the story of a group of boys who, growing up in Hell's Kitchen in NYC, straddle the line between good and evil, and are thrown over the line after their brutal stay at an up-state reform school. Sharing an oath while still young to never disclose the cruelties they've endured, especially sexual brutalization at the hands of a group of guards led by the sadistic Nokes (Kevin Bacon), the group grows into scarred and withdrawn men. With their juvenile records sealed, their inner pain is the only sign of their suffering. Lorenzo (Jason Patric) goes to work for the New York Post, and unsurprisingly becomes the narrator for this tale of woe. Two of the other boys aren't so lucky, becoming coke-addicted Westies-like contract killers, doomed to die before they hit 30. In an inexplicable coincidence, the pair happen across the hapless Nokes in a Manhattan eatery, and extract a cruel revenge. .... In a lucky turn, the subsequent murder prosecution is handed to Michael (Brad Pitt), an ADA and the fourth of the unlucky boys. In a bid to enhance the revenge they all want, Michael plots to throw the trial, revealing Noke's uncharted history as a sexual predator to do the defense attorney's job of raising reasonable doubt. Because some of the prosecution's witnesses were also former reformatory guards, the defense has an opportunity to discredit them and reveal their sins. Those not exposed on the stand are tagged by other contract killers, whether related to our heroes or to other boys brutalized at the reformatory. Besides covering the trial, Lorenzo's job is to protect Michael from retaliation for heading the prosecution against his former friends. As the trial progresses, Michael and Lorenzo are forced to break their oath and reveal what they endured to Father Bobby (Robert De Niro) and Carol Martinez (Minnie Driver playing latina), a local girl and single mother loved by each of the four boys.Despite the premise, Sleepers loses it for me. The great pains the film takes to jar your senses and convince you of its authenticity makes the flick look shallow and manipulative. The script bathes itself in an underworld cool of local gangsters and dark secrets that looks very Hollywood, and Lorenzo' voice-overs don' help. ""It was 98 degrees on the day our lives changed forever"" gives you some clue as to the New York Post style realism that pervades the film and undermines its credibility (Carccaterra's position with the New York Post seems about the only credible thing in this movie). The courtroom looks like some unconvincing Hollywood set (probably the reason why the film requires a screaming subway to cut across now and then). What really kills me is the shallow and high-minded moralism of the film, with characters like Fat Mancho pontificating about justice-for-sale, and ignoring the top-flight cast (with matching paychecks) the movie leans on heavily. De Niro and Hoffman are totally wasted here. As a father I can't easily ignore the cries of victimized children, but I found this film's slickness an insultingly manipulative vehicle for dealing with that horror.",2,Too slick,1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,3128,"['Sleepers', 'purports', 'tell', 'story', 'group', 'boys', 'who', 'growing', 'up', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'NYC', 'straddle', 'line', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'thrown', 'line', 'brutal', 'stay', 'up-state', 'reform', 'school', 'Sharing', 'oath', 'still', 'young', 'never', 'disclose', 'cruelties', ""'ve"", 'endured', 'especially', 'sexual', 'brutalization', 'hands', 'group', 'guards', 'led', 'sadistic', 'Nokes', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'group', 'scarred', 'withdrawn', 'men', 'juvenile', 'records', 'sealed', 'inner', 'pain', 'only', 'sign', 'suffering', 'Lorenzo', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'work', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'unsurprisingly', 'narrator', 'tale', 'woe', 'Two', 'other', 'boys', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'lucky', 'becoming', 'coke-addicted', 'Westies-like', 'contract', 'killers', 'doomed', 'die', 'hit', '30', 'inexplicable', 'coincidence', 'pair', 'happen', 'hapless', 'Nokes', 'Manhattan', 'eatery', 'extract', 'cruel', 'revenge', 'lucky', 'turn', 'subsequent', 'murder', 'prosecution', 'handed', 'Michael', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'ADA', 'fourth', 'unlucky', 'boys', 'bid', 'enhance', 'revenge', 'want', 'Michael', 'plots', 'throw', 'trial', 'revealing', 'Noke', 'uncharted', 'history', 'sexual', 'predator', 'do', 'defense', 'attorney', 'job', 'raising', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'prosecution', 'witnesses', 'were', 'also', 'former', 'reformatory', 'guards', 'defense', 'opportunity', 'discredit', 'reveal', 'sins', 'not', 'exposed', 'stand', 'are', 'tagged', 'other', 'contract', 'killers', 'related', 'heroes', 'other', 'boys', 'brutalized', 'reformatory', 'covering', 'trial', 'Lorenzo', 'job', 'protect', 'Michael', 'retaliation', 'heading', 'prosecution', 'former', 'friends', 'trial', 'Michael', 'Lorenzo', 'are', 'forced', 'break', 'oath', 'reveal', 'what', 'endured', 'Father', 'Bobby', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Carol', 'Martinez', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'playing', 'latina', 'local', 'girl', 'single', 'mother', 'loved', 'four', 'boys.Despite', 'premise', 'Sleepers', 'great', 'film', 'jar', 'senses', 'convince', 'authenticity', 'flick', 'look', 'shallow', 'manipulative', 'script', 'underworld', 'cool', 'local', 'gangsters', 'dark', 'secrets', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'Lorenzo', 'voice-overs', 'don', 'help', 'was', '98', 'degrees', 'day', 'lives', 'changed', 'forever', 'clue', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'style', 'realism', 'film', 'undermines', 'credibility', 'Carccaterra', 'position', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'only', 'credible', 'thing', 'movie', 'courtroom', 'unconvincing', 'Hollywood', 'set', 'probably', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'screaming', 'subway', 'cut', 'across', 'now', 'then', 'What', 'really', 'kills', 'shallow', 'high-minded', 'moralism', 'film', 'characters', 'Fat', 'Mancho', 'pontificating', 'justice-for-sale', 'ignoring', 'top-flight', 'cast', 'matching', 'paychecks', 'movie', 'heavily', 'De', 'Niro', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'totally', 'wasted', 'here', 'father', 'ca', ""n't"", 'easily', 'ignore', 'cries', 'victimized', 'children', 'found', 'film', 'slickness', 'insultingly', 'manipulative', 'vehicle', 'dealing', 'horror']",N/A

89336,A3JLKDUV0B6O5U,0790729393,TFR,"[4, 10]","I went out and bought this dvd used, for about five dollars. Here are ten - Count `em - (10) observations:1. When the Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup characters confront the Kevin Bacon Character in a Hell's Kitchen tavern near the middle of the story, ""Sleepers"" is absolutely electric. This scene is worth the price of the dvd alone. (Would the two hoods have killed the former reformatory guard in this manner? Probably not, but what is shown makes for better theater, and an easier transition.)2. Alas, ""Sleepers"" does not continue with the same sort of intensity as the above-mentioned murder scene. The story begins and moves along at an even pace, but once the trial of the Eldard and Crudup characters begins, the story becomes more ambiguous and ends rather abruptly.3. Which brings us to the foundation and integrity of the film: The story appears to be mostly believable up to the above-mentioned murder. After that, it gets pretty dicey.4. Also, the timeline in ""Sleepers"" is sort of weird. The characters seem to have been born around 1950 - 1952, but are still preteen kids by 1967 or 1968, which, judging from the background music (""Alone Again Or"" by Love) appears to be when they were sent to the boy's reformatory. By 1981, which is when the killing of the Bacon Character takes place, they are all supposed to be in their mid-twenties.5. A City or County Prosecutor in his mid-twenties, even in New York, is rather rare. Maybe he might have had some type of connection with some alderman or some old Irish Democrat, but if he did, he would never have been sent to the reformatory in the first place. Anyway, Brad Pitt looked like he was about ninteen when this film was made.6. Robert DeNiro played himself with his ""Regular New York Guy"" routine, but his character's motives for lying under oath was too contrived. I'm not saying that a priest would be incapable of doing something like this; After all, beside having dedicated their live to the pursuit of spirituality, priests are human beings as well and vulnerable to the same feelings about situations that we all face from time to time. However, under the given circumstances, this sort of ""feel good"" ending was slightly unbelievable and too gimmicky.7. The popular music sprinkled throughout the soundtrack really does not fit what was happening visually in the film. I was also surprised to find that the soundtrack CD only contained the background music. ""Walk Like a Man"" by the Four Seasons, which was so prominently used in the film, never made it to the soundtrack CD.8. It's hard to believe that so many good actors were assembled for this film. Dustin Hoffman, DeNiro, Minnie Driver, Brad Pitt, Jason Patrick and all the rest of the cast did their part to live up to the billing. This all-star cast was what probably saved ""Sleepers"". With lesser actors, one wonders what the final outcome would have been.9. ""Sleepers"" is not a bad film, it's just not a great one. This is the sort of thing that happens when you get three or more big box office draws working the same project. The final product appears to be mediocre, because it can't possibly live up to the advance billing.10. I wish Levinson had made more of the tavern murder scene throughout the film, i.e. flashbacks, different camera angles, etc. Eldard and Crudup, along with the direction of this scene are simply amazing. They were right on target with their portrayal of two young hoods.Bonus comment: Why do directors like Levinson persist in trying to portray old Mafia Dons as wise, stoic old men?

The first part is a drama that involves four young teenagers in the sixties, Hell's Kitchen, New York. They make a stupid mistake that sends them to a reformatory, the Wilkinson home for boys. Here they are sexually abused by the guards including Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon). The second parts is about the revenge the four boys have when they are grown up. If you do not want to know what they're plan is, read no further.Two of the boys, John (Ron Eldard) and Tommy (Billy Crudup), have become killers and one day, 1981, they see Nokes in a restaurant. They walk up to him, shoot him, and leave. The District Attorney who handles their case is Michael (Brad Pitt), one of the four. He has asked for the case, not to win, but to lose. It is time for revenge. Together with Shakes (Jason Patric), the narrator of the story, they come up with a plan to expose events at Wilkinson. Key figures here are John and Tommy's lawyer Snyder (Dustin Hoffman), the girl they all like Carol (Minnie Driver), the Mafia boss from the neighborhood King Benny (Vittorio Gassman), and a priest who has been friends with the four forever, Father Bobby (Robert DeNiro).The first part is very good with four kid actors who are not annoying and a Bacon who is close to pure evil. The way they set up the story is very good as well. We learn to know the kids, King Benny, Father Bobby, the neighborhood. We feel we understand how things work in Hell's Kitchen which is pretty important to make events plausible when the kids have grown up. The second part is not as good but as least as interesting. There are more question we could ask here, but fine actors like DeNiro, Hoffman, Pitt and Patric know how to create believable characters. Although what they do might not be the right thing, we somehow hope they pull it off.  Director Barry Levinson has made a good film, yet with nearly two-and-a-half hours of film, ""Sleepers"" is perhaps a little drawn out. He finds the right way to tell this sad story, with a perfect set-up and with interesting courtroom scenes in the second part. The star power probably does the rest. Hoffman and De Niro are great as always, Bacon is perfectly creepy, Pitt, Patric and Driver are effective, and John Williams' score is great.

Most of the end is pretty good too, except for the ridiculous courtroom strategy.Slight spoliers to follow >>> Murder victims do not need ""character witnesses"".  Maybe a glowing assessment of the murder victim during a sentancing hearing but not during the trial.  Further, the ""alibi"" stuff was nonsense.  If the murderers had the alibi Dinero gave them they would have told the police that during the investigation and the case never would have gone to trial.  Finally, you can't call witnesses with no notice to the prosection.  Absurd.The movie is 3 to 4 stars for entertainment.  They deal with the brutality fairly tastefully.  But only one star due to the stupid coutroom plot - plus I got tired to looking at Brad Pitt's nose job.  He was the worst in terms of acting (for better Brad Pitt acting see Meet Joe Black - though some say his acting there stinks).  Hoffman starts out slow, but gets better.  He plays the same character in every movie (i.e, since Rainman that is the only character he seems to be able to play).And what was the hideous Minnnie Driver doing in this movie?  She added nothing.

89341,AJYGQV81FSFE2,0790729393,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[3, 5]","Many of the previous reviewers covered the plot of the film. Some mentioned that the story is allegedly true, yet the NY State corrections board, or whoever governs the subject matter, denies it.Is it true? Who knows. I doubt it is word for word. But even if only conceptually true, it was a wonder of revenge.I think those denying the story's truth do so because the young guys who'd been miserably abused while youngsters in a &quot;reform school&quot; in New York essentially planned--and succeeded at!-- revenge. The opportunity slipped into their hands when two of the guys--older, and real thugs with murder raps longer than a linebacker's arm--ran across the chief abuser in one of their Hell's Kitchen watering holes. They did him in, and stood trial for it. One of the other abusees--and I'm talking about real abuse, not some recovered nonsense of Aunt Tilly spanking you when you were five--just happened to be a prosecutor. He was the real planner. He, and the character of the guy who wrote the book--then a budding journalist--worked with the Internal Affairs Dept. of the police, drug dealers, mobsters, and an inept, alchoholic attorney (Strange bedfellows? Also a reason to deny its truth?) to LOSE the case against the murderers, to expose other abusers (and the system), and make more public what they had undergone while in the state's &quot;care.&quot; The planning, like any planning, had its weak points, in this case the key witness, a priest portrayed by none other than Robert DeNiro, who'd always stood by the boys from the time they were relatively harmless to now when they were dangerous.As someone pointed out, DeNiro, after much painful discernment, perjured, and that was the key to a not guilty verdict.I could see why they'd deny it: the justice system is supposed to work to ensure justice. How could one successfully PLAN to use it to ensure personal vengence??Agreed with many a reviewer: the acting was great (though I admit I think Brad Pitt is one of the most overrated actors in Hollywood). The film is almost remarkably similar to the book; there were a few details left out of the film, and the religion of Dustin Hoffman's character was different in the film. (If I recall correctly, in the book he's an Irish Catholic, in the film he is probably Jewish). Maybe there are so many Irish Catholic attorneys in NYC that the producers feared a legal suit.Sure, it's not a real happy ending. The murderers were dead before they were 30. But what sweet revenge! Come on, admit it. You've all sometimes felt that desire...Within the couple of hours the film takes enough was shown of the background of the characters that describe where many of their attitudes and lifestyles may have come from. Bruno Kirby did a great job as Carcatarra's dad, an ex-con with a hot temper, and anecdotes of revenge. So, while there some inferable influence of the abuse on the murders' chosen career path (!) there wasn't a tone of &quot;if it weren't for the abuse, they might have been life insurance salesmen in Westchester County.&quot; They probably would have spent the rest of their lives in Hell's Kitchen anyway!An aside: I liked the reference too in the guys' background that they were altar boys (Dominus vobiscum...been there, done that...)at the funerals of Hell's Kitchen's Vietnam deaths. They may have seen us demonstrators on the tube, but they were too busy surviving--or getting drafted and NOT surviving--to worry about the stuff many of us had the opportunities to do.Well done, Mr. Carcatarra (forgive my probable misspelling) and Mr. Levinson.

89343,ABLBRUT8DALNN,0790729393,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances.
