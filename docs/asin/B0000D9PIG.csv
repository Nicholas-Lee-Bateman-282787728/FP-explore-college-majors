777139,A281387UUS2IN5,B0000D9PIG,Beantown Jim,"[2, 2]","It appears that the great group Foreigner had to replace Lou Gramm, their longtime lead singer with the unique voice.  He broke away and became a separate performer.  In getting a Foreigner DVD, I insisted upon getting one with the great original Lou Gramm.  If you feel the same way, then this disk is your best, if not only, choice.  Here, Lou does all the great hits, and Foreigner's album of hits stands up as well as anyone's.  The DVD is not perfect, as no concert can be perfect when compared to the studio recording which is indeed perfect.  Still, this disk has everything you would want in a Foreigner work and as such is a great bargain.",4,"Almost perferct, and with Lou Gramm",1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,648,"['great', 'group', 'Foreigner', 'had', 'replace', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'longtime', 'lead', 'singer', 'unique', 'voice', 'broke', 'away', 'became', 'separate', 'performer', 'getting', 'Foreigner', 'DVD', 'insisted', 'getting', 'one', 'great', 'original', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'then', 'disk', 'best', 'not', 'only', 'choice', 'Here', 'Lou', 'great', 'hits', 'Foreigner', 'album', 'hits', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'DVD', 'not', 'perfect', 'concert', 'can', 'be', 'perfect', 'when', 'compared', 'studio', 'recording', 'indeed', 'perfect', 'Still', 'disk', 'everything', 'would', 'want', 'Foreigner', 'work', 'such', 'great', 'bargain']",N/A

But I've loved Foreigner for years, and had seen clips from this tour on YouTube. I was pleased with the overall quality of the production, and enjoyed seeing how Foreigner evolved in terms of performance between the Feels Like the Very First Time video and this one. Whatever water may have gone under the bridge during those years, this performance was top-notch, and both Gramm and Jones seemed to be happy to be back out there live.Gramm's voice was always unique and recognizable; I'm one of those fans who enjoyed it even more as it matured, and as his delivery became richer and more nuanced. And yes, both as performer and songwriter, he could still rock you down to your shoetops. That's worth the price and more.Thanks to Foreigner for all the music through the years, and especially to Lou for hanging in there. I'd go see Lou without Foreigner, but not Foreigner without Lou.

Fortunately, I recently had the opportunity to watch this DVD on a videostore and I realized that my fears were unfounded.This DVD reviews have mentioned too many complains about the video or production quality, and although I don't disagree with some of these comments, its flaws aren't that great so as to detract from the real pleasure of owning this DVD... watching Foreigner at arguably, their peak.The concert video and sound are very good, more so considering this is not a recent tour.  This concert is based on the The Very Best ... and Beyond Tour, and I watched them in Caracas, Venezuela during this tour.  It was an amazing concert.  This DVD captures its spirit and showcases the great setlist Foreigner played during the tour.I do not regret at all buying this DVD, this is Lou and Mick at their very best, great songs, great energy.
