No expense is spared in showing the detail of the French bourgeosie striving to live like the aristocracy they replaced. The acting is very good, especially the two leads, Jacqueline Bisset and Armand Assante. In my book, Josephine was one of the smartest women in history. I'd like to see a new movie done about her as they did Marie Antoinette. If Marie had been as intelligent as Josephine, she probably would have survived the French Revolution.",5,Good Introduction to Napoleon,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,512,"['Fans', 'lush', 'programs', 'Dynasty', 'will', 'enjoy', 'miniseries', 'expense', 'spared', 'showing', 'detail', 'French', 'bourgeosie', 'striving', 'live', 'aristocracy', 'replaced', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'book', 'Josephine', 'was', 'one', 'smartest', 'women', 'history', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'new', 'movie', 'done', 'about', 'did', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Marie', 'had', 'been', 'as', 'intelligent', 'Josephine', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'French', 'Revolution']",Napoleon and Josephine VHS

And, I always thought that Jacqueline Bisset was only a so so  actress but she does a wonderful job in this.  I taped this when it ran on t.v. many years ago and still have it. I've ordered the DVD and am looking forward to seeing it without all those horrible long commercials that have to be fast forwarded over.  Before going to France the first time I did a long study of the history of France which, of course, included a study of Napoleon and Josephine.  I visited Malmaison while I was in France the first time just to see where so much of their story took place. Nothing like standing where they stood so to speak.  As I have said, this is my favorite of the movies I've seen about Napoleon. Asante never puts a foot wrong in his portrayal and the same may be said for Bisset. Later: I have received the DVD and checked the end. One reviewer had said that only half the movie was on his DVD.

Tells the story clearly and shows just how much Napoleon was obsessed with her.  Unfortunately they gave each other the greatest love of their lives but also hurt each other tremendously.  Their story is complex as they each find they love each other at different times in their relationship and remain in love despite not being able to meet each others needs.  Armand and Jacqueline give the best performances of their careers and yet this movie was never popular, and that escapes me as I have no idea why.  It is brilliant and if you love this time period you will not be dissapointed.  It is one of my favorite period pieces.
