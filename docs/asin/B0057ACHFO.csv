1444641,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0057ACHFO,Michael Butts,"[4, 7]","This is definitely a kid-oriented movie and on that level, it succeeds as a cute enjoyable film.  Adults might find it too contrived and difficult to appreciate.THE PUPPY YEARS is obviously an attempt to cash in on its successful origins but is so amateurishly done, there is no real comparison.  First problem is the decision to have the animals talk.  It's become a tired device and the voice characterizations aren't particularly effective.  The human actors tend to overact and poor Donnelly Rhodes (DaVinci's Inquest) is forced to act as second banana to the dogs.But I'm being too Scroogish...family films are intended to entertain families looking for wholesome entertainment.
