138520,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,0792837592,Brian A. Schar,"[6, 7]","This musical is such a staple of American culture that you already know everything about the plot already.  You've probably seen the movie, or been in or seen one of the millions of high-school drama versions of this old standby.  A rugged mountain man/farmer (how he farms in the mountains is not explained) finds a wife and brings her back to his cabin to cook and clean for him and his six brothers.  She cleans them up, teaches them a thing or two about manners, and then dance fighting ensues at a barnraising.  The brothers get served, they serve it right back, and then it's on.  Unfortunately, the newly-raised barn is quickly razed as a result.  After that debacle, the brothers figure the only way to get wives is to kidnap them, so they do so in a manner not entirely unlike how the Grinch stole Christmas.  After a long winter the womenfolk all come down with a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome, and you might guess what happens after that.Despite the kidnappin' and so forth, this remains a good-natured movie with some excellent singing and dancing.  And at a hour 40 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome, unlike, say, the decent but interminable ""Paint Your Wagon.""

138524,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,0792837592,Byron Kolln,"[25, 25]","Excellent new `Special Edition' of the musical masterpiece SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS, featuring both versions of the film plus a generous array of extras.Set against the backdrop of settlement-era Oregon, the story concerns Adam Pontipee (Howard Keel) who takes a wife in Milly (Jane Powell) before delivering her to his mountaintop ranch.  The honeymoon comes to an abrupt end when Milly learns she must also keep house for Adam's six unruly - and uncouth - brothers!  But after Milly teaches them the finer points of ""Goin' Courtin'"" they go and and find brides of their own...with diastrous, hilarious and heartwarming results.The cast is simply amazing.  Among the `Brothers' are Russ Tamblyn, Broadway dancer Marc Platt, New York City Ballet star Jacques d'Amboise and KISS ME KATE's Tommy Rall.  The `Brides' include Broadway's Virginia Gibson, B-movie beauty Ruta Lee (in her film debut) and future `Catwoman' Julie Newmar.The score has become one of the most beloved ever written and elevates the on-screen story into the high heavens.  Gene DePaul and Johnny Mercer's flavoursome tunestack includes Milly's jubilant ""Wonderful Wonderful Day""; her moonlight aria ""When You're in Love"" and the soaring ""June Bride"" with the girls dancing in corsets and bloomers.  Adam isn't overlooked music-wise, his numbers include ""Bless Yore Beautiful Hide"", the syncopated and irresistible ""Sobbin' Women"" and the brothers' plaintive ""Lonesome Polecat"".  Choreographer Michael Kidd's routines in this film are among his all-time best, including what many consider his Magnum Opus, the showstopping ""Barn Raising Ballet"".  With so many talented dancers among the `Brothers' and `Brides', it's no wonder that this film is so rich in musical numbers.This is the peak of the original M-G-M musical.  It's hard to believe now, but at the time the studio heads had no faith whatsoever in the project and dismissed it as a B-movie.  BRIGADOON was also being made at the same time, a film M-G-M held great hopes for, though it was SEVEN BRIDES.. that the audiences and critics fell in love with.SEVEN BRIDES..  was actually filmed twice.  It was intended for the film to be seen exclusively in the new CinemaScope but many movie theaters did not have the facilities to show films in this ratio.  So an open-matte 1:78 `flat' format version of the film was made to accommodate the problem.  This Special Edition contains both versions of the film.  It's almost like attending two different performances of the same show.  The CinemaScope version looks a treat in 16:9 enhanced widescreen, and the colours are magnificent.Extras include an updated version of ""Sobbin' Women: The Making of..."" (previously seen on the first DVD edition) which features new interview footage with Jane Powell as well as Jacques d'Amboise.  Audio commentary is provided by director Stanley Donen who offers listeners a rare insight into the production of this masterpiece.  There are two rare newsreels (""Radio City Music Hall Premiere"" and ""M-G-M 30th Anniversary"" which features commentary by Jane Powell and Ann Miller).  Also included is the rare CinemaScope ""M-G-M Jubilee Overture"".With this all-new `Special Edition', it's a ""Wonderful Wonderful Day"" for SEVEN BRIDES.. fans!",5,"a ""Wonderful Wonderful Day"" for SEVEN BRIDES.. fans!",1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,3254,"['Excellent', 'new', 'Special', 'Edition', 'musical', 'masterpiece', 'SEVEN', 'BRIDES', 'FOR', 'SEVEN', 'BROTHERS', 'featuring', 'versions', 'film', 'generous', 'array', 'extras.Set', 'backdrop', 'settlement-era', 'Oregon', 'story', 'concerns', 'Adam', 'Pontipee', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'who', 'wife', 'Milly', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'delivering', 'mountaintop', 'ranch', 'honeymoon', 'abrupt', 'end', 'when', 'Milly', 'must', 'also', 'keep', 'house', 'Adam', 'six', 'unruly', 'uncouth', 'brothers', 'Milly', 'finer', 'points', 'Goin', 'Courtin', 'go', 'find', 'brides', 'own', 'diastrous', 'hilarious', 'heartwarming', 'results.The', 'cast', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Brothers', 'are', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'Broadway', 'dancer', 'Marc', 'Platt', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Ballet', 'star', 'Jacques', ""d'Amboise"", 'KISS', 'ME', 'KATE', 'Tommy', 'Rall', 'Brides', 'include', 'Broadway', 'Virginia', 'Gibson', 'B-movie', 'beauty', 'Ruta', 'Lee', 'film', 'debut', 'future', 'Catwoman', 'Julie', 'Newmar.The', 'score', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'ever', 'written', 'on-screen', 'story', 'high', 'heavens', 'Gene', 'DePaul', 'Johnny', 'Mercer', 'flavoursome', 'tunestack', 'Milly', 'jubilant', 'Wonderful', 'Wonderful', 'Day', 'moonlight', 'aria', 'When', ""'re"", 'Love', 'soaring', 'June', 'Bride', 'girls', 'dancing', 'corsets', 'bloomers', 'Adam', ""n't"", 'overlooked', 'music-wise', 'numbers', 'include', 'Bless', 'Yore', 'Beautiful', 'Hide', 'syncopated', 'irresistible', 'Sobbin', 'Women', 'brothers', 'plaintive', 'Lonesome', 'Polecat', 'Choreographer', 'Michael', 'Kidd', 'routines', 'film', 'are', 'all-time', 'best', 'including', 'what', 'many', 'consider', 'Magnum', 'Opus', 'showstopping', 'Barn', 'Raising', 'Ballet', 'so', 'many', 'talented', 'dancers', 'Brothers', 'Brides', 'wonder', 'film', 'so', 'rich', 'musical', 'numbers.This', 'peak', 'original', 'M-G-M', 'musical', 'hard', 'believe', 'now', 'time', 'studio', 'heads', 'had', 'faith', 'whatsoever', 'project', 'dismissed', 'B-movie', 'BRIGADOON', 'was', 'also', 'being', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'M-G-M', 'held', 'great', 'hopes', 'was', 'SEVEN', 'BRIDES..', 'audiences', 'critics', 'fell', 'love', 'with.SEVEN', 'BRIDES..', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'twice', 'was', 'intended', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'exclusively', 'new', 'CinemaScope', 'many', 'movie', 'theaters', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'facilities', 'show', 'films', 'ratio', 'open-matte', '1:78', 'flat', 'format', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'accommodate', 'problem', 'Special', 'Edition', 'contains', 'versions', 'film', 'almost', 'attending', 'two', 'different', 'performances', 'same', 'show', 'CinemaScope', 'version', 'treat', '16:9', 'enhanced', 'widescreen', 'colours', 'are', 'magnificent.Extras', 'include', 'updated', 'version', 'Sobbin', 'Women', 'Making', 'previously', 'seen', 'first', 'DVD', 'edition', 'new', 'interview', 'footage', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'as', 'well', 'Jacques', ""d'Amboise"", 'Audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'who', 'listeners', 'rare', 'insight', 'production', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'two', 'rare', 'newsreels', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'Premiere', 'M-G-M', '30th', 'Anniversary', 'commentary', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'Also', 'included', 'rare', 'CinemaScope', 'M-G-M', 'Jubilee', 'Overture', '.With', 'all-new', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Wonderful', 'Wonderful', 'Day', 'SEVEN', 'BRIDES..', 'fans']",N/A
138525,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,0792837592,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[3, 4]","I'm typically not a big fan of musicals but Seven Brides for Seven Brothers works.  The story revolves around seven brothers scratching a living out of a farm in the Oregon Mountains in the 1800's.  Adam, the oldest brother, goes to town one day and comes back with a wife - Mille, played by Jane Powell.  Poor Millie finds herself playing the role of cook and washer woman for the seven ruffians and immediately puts her foot down and sets out to make the uncouth group a respectable bunch.  She plays the role of big sister and mother and is really, more so than Adam, the focal character in the movie.The boys, being boys, are lonely and set out to find themselves wives.  Adam comes up with a harebrained scheme to kidnapped the girls they've set their hearts on and indeed, they do so.  It is also a bit of harebrained plot device but it works here.The music and dancing in this movie are excellent.  And taken as a semi-comedic musical the movie works well and is quite entertaining.While the sets seem a bit dated, it was released in 1954, the quality and sound on this DVD is excellent.

138528,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,0792837592,Classic film buff,"[3, 3]","As I muddle through this winter from hell in frigid upstate New York with at least one significant snowstorm each week since the day after Christmas my thoughts turned towards this film which I remembered had a musical lament about the unceasing snow.  Given that situation & the fact that it has been several years since I viewed this, I pulled the DVD out of my own film library, and was thoroughly entertained all over again.The time is 1850 in the Oregon territory when Adam Pontipee (Howard Keel) the oldest of seven bachelor brothers who all live together in a farm up in the mountains ventures into town to find himself a wife. By day's end he has, the pretty, petite, spunky Millie (Jane Powell). Adam has deliberately withheld telling her of his six younger brothers in residence, and the fact that are scruffy, rough mannered and uncouth.  However Millie very shortly has the brothers whipped into shape, and there is a growing fondness between them.  Soon the brothers want wives of their own, and Millie helps them with the rituals of courtship and teaches them to dance.  At a barn raising party the boys meet six enticing young women from the town, and although the girls are definitely interested, they all have beaux from the town.  Despite the brothers' promise to Millie to be on their best behavior a heated brawl breaks out between them and the townsmen that ends disastrously.  The girls' families are appalled by the loutish behavior, and the Pontipee brothers in a tangle of regret and desire moon dejectedly around the farm.  Adam then comes up with an idea that he has gotten from ""Plutarch's Lives"", about the abduction of the Sabine women by the ancient Romans.  He suggests they do the same but kidnap a minister as well to marry them all.  With their hormones in overdrive, the brothers enthusiastically agree, and they take off in a sleigh through the winter night to get their women, which they do.  With the women wailing and struggling, and the men from the town in hot pursuit, the brothers deliberately cause an avalanche that blocks the pass on the road to their home.  Since the winter has just begun, the townspeople won't be able to get to them until the spring thaw.  The brothers' moment of triumph is short lived however, Millie horrified and repulsed by the act, banishes them all from the house and into the barn, the girls shun them, and worst of all they forget to bring the preacher!""Seven Brides..."" became a sleeper for it's studio, MGM, which hadn't high hopes for it. You can see why it was, it's unpretentious and original, having a folksy charm, a well written script by Frances Hackett, Albert Goodrich and Dorothy Kingsley, skillful direction by Stanley Donen, engaging tunes by Gene DePaul and Johnny Mercer, an appealing cast headed by Jane Powell and Howard Keel, and I think the most important factor superb choreography by Michael Kidd.  This is very masculine themed musical overall, a lot of testosterone flowing, with the seven red headed, robust, hot-blooded Pontipee brothers dominating the story.  It has a simple goal to entertain it's audience, and it does and then some.The barn raising dance, the most celebrated sequence in the film, and one of the top ten most memorable dance numbers in musical films exemplifies this perfectly.  The brothers vie with the townsmen over the attention of the young women.  It is a both a challenge and a mating dance, both sets of men competing with each other to outdo the other in terms of demonstrating their able bodied prowess and thereby impressing the women with their virility.  The resulting number is both brilliant and exhilarating, showcasing the extraordinary versatility of the male dancers particularly the Pontipee brothers.  The three that really dazzle are Tommy Rall, Russ Tamblyn and Matt Mattox.  They soar and seem to defy gravity, the combined grace and power could get them in the Olympics for gymnastics: backward leaps on balance boards several feet off the ground,cartwheels agilely spun over the same, Rall nimbly dancing on the rolling cylinder of a well while Marc Platt turns the handle, Tamblyn leaping back and forth over an axe held in his hands, Mattox flying sky high touching his hands to his feet as he executes several perfect splits, so wide it's astounding he doesn't split his pants!  The other two dancing brothers Jacques D'Amboise and Marc Platt are ballet trained and more lyrical in their dancing, but excellent nonetheless.  These men are trailblazers following Gene Kelly's vigorous, muscular style to show ""real men"" could dance, even ballet!Leads Howard Keel and Jane Powell supply most of the singing.  Ms. Powell gets to trill sweetly a lilting song on her wedding day ""Wonderful, Wonderful Day!"" plus the yearning ballad  ""When You're in Love"", and a sprightly number with the brothers called ""Goin' Courtin"" that evolves into a rowdy, good natured dance.  Keel's songs are more hearty and robust as befits his strong baritone and Adam's self assured character, ""Bless Your Beautiful Hide"" sung while hunting for a wife, and ""Sobbin' Women"" a full throated lusty number he uses to persuade his brothers to go grab their gals!  He does get a chance to reveal his more vulnerable side though in a reprise of ""When You're in Love"".  Both pair each other well romantically as the main couple of the piece.The would be brides get a chance to sparkle in ""June Bride"" sung and danced in their corsets and pantalets as they daydream about their wedding day.  They also sing ""Spring, Spring, Spring"", which begins with their heartfelt weariness with the unrelenting snow in a downcast tempo and brightens in tone as spring finally bursts out in all its glory, and they at last get to join the brothers outside the house in the warmth of the sun!  It's refreshing that although the ladies are attractive, they are not in the usual Hollywood mold, and actually look their parts as pioneer women.  The one bride who achieved a degree of fame is Julie Newmeyer, who is better known as Julie Newmar, the original ""Catwoman"" in the 1960's ""Batman"" series.I own the 1 disc CD, which besides the original trailer, has a standout documentary of the making of the film  called ""Sobbin Women: The Making of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.""  Howard Keel is the narrator, it has interviews and recollections by Stanley Donen, Michael Kidd, Saul Chaplin, and cast members Jane Powell, Tommy Rall, Russ Tamblyn and Julie Newmar.  This is chock full of fascinating nuggets for example the fact that the late Michael Kidd at first refused to do the choreography, yet this is the movie for which he probably will be remembered in years to come.So, yet another snowstorm, a one-two punch for this Tuesday and Wednesday,but each day is one less day of winter to endure.  In the meantime, I highly recommend viewing this splendid, bouyant musical that sheds its own warmth and light. Look at it as a harbinger of the spring, that just as in the film, may take forever to arrive, but will be all the sweeter when it does!",5,"""And though they'll be a sobbin fer awhile, we're goin' to

138529,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0792837592,C. O. DeRiemer,"[6, 6]","What has this MGM musical, on the cusp of the Hollywood musical's long decline, have going for it? For starters, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers has a generous story with healthy, naughty overtones; a boisterous score; two attractive leads, both of whom can sing while smiling; great scenery, even if the movie was shot on sound stages; dances that are original and precise; and, rare in movie musicals, a genuinely masculine feel thanks to the seven Pontipee brothers, all of whom were definitely male with four of them played by great dancers and one by a gifted gymnast.The story is a tale of sex and abduction...no, better make that a search for wives by seven well-intentioned nature's gentlemen who are a bit rough around the edges. Adam Pontipee (Howard Keel), the eldest brother, leaves the isolated Oregon homestead he and his six brothers work and takes the long, long ride into the small town miles away. He's after supplies and a wife. Surprisingly, he finds both. Milly (Jane Powell), a young woman who wants her own life, is swept off her feet, agrees to marry Adam, and off they go back to the homestead. What she finds isn't as bad as Elsa Knudsen meeting the Hammond brothers, but it's clear the Pontipees haven't much acquaintance with soap. The Pontipee house is a mess and so are the Pontipee table manners. Milly begins to straighten out the house and the brothers, and the brothers begin thinking that having wives of their own might not be a bad idea. Milly starts to teach them the finer aspects of courting, but Adam encourages them to just go into town and abduct the young women they'd met at a barn-raising. They do...and Milly nearly brings down the house around them. But then winter sets in, the pass is blocked, the young women can't be returned even if they want (they really don't), and Milly dictates the sleeping arrangements, which is not what the brothers had in mind. And that includes for Adam. When spring comes, Milly says, the girls get returned or they get married. Until then, she's going to be an iron-fisted chaperone. In time, with Spring, all is happily resolved.With the story an amusing, sweet-natured comedy of longing, frustration, good-intentions and hormones, for me Seven Brides for Seven Brothers stands out for three reasons. First, lyric writer Johnny Mercer and composer Gene de Paul constructed a score of outstanding, rambunctious songs interspersed with a few easy-to-take, serviceable romance songs. ""Bless Your Beautiful Hide,"" ""Goin' Courtin',"" ""Lonesome Polecat"" and ""Sobbin' Women"" carry the movie along with great good spirits and a little bit of irony. Second is the dancers. Of the seven Pontipees, four do the dancing...Tommy Rall, Marc Platt, Matt Mattox and Jacques d'Amboise. They were all classically trained in ballet with careers that didn't often, except for Rall, include Hollywood. They are fast, controlled, precise and believable as backwoods types who just happen to be able to spin, leap and stomp. Russ Tamblyn, the gymnast, joins them with integrated flips. Third, is Michael Kidd's choreography, with the highlight being the long barn-raising sequence. The Pontipees, all washed and spiffed up, have come to town to meet some girls, decide to take part in a barn raising because that's where the girls are, but the girls have young townsmen who don't take kindly to the backwoods competition. We're off on a clever, vigorous square dance that quickly turns into a challenge dance between the Pontipee brothers and the townsmen, and that moves from the square dance to the building of the barn. Kidd has constructed one series of challenges after another, using everything from lumber on wooden horses to axes. It's athletic and funny. Tamblyn holds his own, and Rall, Platt, Mattox and d'Amboise shine.According the Donen, MGM placed its bets that Brigadoon, directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Gene Kelly, which was being shot at the same time as Seven Brides, would be the big smash. MGM executives took half of Donen's budget and gave it to Minnelli. How wrong they were. Brigadoon turned out to be a disappointment, stagy and self-conscious. Nowadays, it looks dated. Seven Brides just took off. Fifty years later it still is a joy to watch, and that barn-raising sequence is a dance classic. Donen was 27 when Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was released. He and Michael Kidd did alright.The DVD transfer is excellent, crisp and colorful.",5,"One of the great MGM musicals, with the seven Pontipee brothers, two attractive leads and four superb dancers",1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,4438,"['What', 'MGM', 'musical', 'cusp', 'Hollywood', 'musical', 'long', 'decline', 'have', 'going', 'starters', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'generous', 'story', 'healthy', 'naughty', 'overtones', 'boisterous', 'score', 'two', 'attractive', 'leads', 'whom', 'can', 'sing', 'smiling', 'great', 'scenery', 'even', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'sound', 'stages', 'dances', 'are', 'original', 'precise', 'rare', 'movie', 'musicals', 'genuinely', 'masculine', 'feel', 'thanks', 'seven', 'Pontipee', 'brothers', 'whom', 'were', 'definitely', 'male', 'four', 'played', 'great', 'dancers', 'one', 'gifted', 'gymnast.The', 'story', 'tale', 'sex', 'abduction', 'better', 'make', 'search', 'wives', 'seven', 'well-intentioned', 'nature', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'rough', 'edges', 'Adam', 'Pontipee', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'eldest', 'brother', 'isolated', 'Oregon', 'homestead', 'six', 'brothers', 'work', 'long', 'long', 'ride', 'small', 'town', 'miles', 'away', 'supplies', 'wife', 'Surprisingly', 'Milly', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'life', 'swept', 'feet', 'marry', 'Adam', 'go', 'back', 'homestead', 'What', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'Elsa', 'Knudsen', 'meeting', 'Hammond', 'brothers', 'clear', 'Pontipees', 'have', ""n't"", 'much', 'acquaintance', 'soap', 'Pontipee', 'house', 'mess', 'so', 'are', 'Pontipee', 'table', 'manners', 'Milly', 'straighten', 'out', 'house', 'brothers', 'brothers', 'begin', 'thinking', 'having', 'wives', 'own', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'idea', 'Milly', 'teach', 'finer', 'aspects', 'courting', 'Adam', 'just', 'go', 'town', 'abduct', 'young', 'women', ""'d"", 'met', 'barn-raising', 'do', 'Milly', 'nearly', 'down', 'house', 'then', 'winter', 'sets', 'pass', 'blocked', 'young', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'returned', 'even', 'want', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'Milly', 'sleeping', 'arrangements', 'not', 'what', 'brothers', 'had', 'mind', 'Adam', 'When', 'spring', 'Milly', 'girls', 'get', 'returned', 'get', 'married', 'then', 'going', 'be', 'iron-fisted', 'chaperone', 'time', 'Spring', 'happily', 'resolved.With', 'story', 'amusing', 'sweet-natured', 'comedy', 'longing', 'frustration', 'good-intentions', 'hormones', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'out', 'three', 'reasons', 'First', 'lyric', 'writer', 'Johnny', 'Mercer', 'composer', 'Gene', 'de', 'Paul', 'constructed', 'score', 'outstanding', 'rambunctious', 'songs', 'interspersed', 'few', 'easy-to-take', 'serviceable', 'romance', 'songs', 'Beautiful', 'Hide', 'Goin', 'Courtin', 'Lonesome', 'Polecat', 'Sobbin', 'Women', 'carry', 'movie', 'great', 'good', 'spirits', 'little', 'bit', 'irony', 'Second', 'dancers', 'seven', 'Pontipees', 'four', 'do', 'dancing', 'Tommy', 'Rall', 'Marc', 'Platt', 'Matt', 'Mattox', 'Jacques', ""d'Amboise"", 'were', 'classically', 'trained', 'ballet', 'careers', 'did', ""n't"", 'often', 'Rall', 'include', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'fast', 'controlled', 'precise', 'believable', 'backwoods', 'types', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'able', 'spin', 'leap', 'stomp', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'gymnast', 'integrated', 'flips', 'Third', 'Michael', 'Kidd', 'choreography', 'highlight', 'being', 'long', 'barn-raising', 'sequence', 'Pontipees', 'washed', 'spiffed', 'up', 'have', 'come', 'town', 'meet', 'girls', 'decide', 'take', 'part', 'barn', 'raising', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'girls', 'have', 'young', 'townsmen', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'kindly', 'backwoods', 'competition', ""'re"", 'off', 'clever', 'vigorous', 'square', 'dance', 'quickly', 'challenge', 'dance', 'Pontipee', 'brothers', 'townsmen', 'square', 'dance', 'building', 'barn', 'Kidd', 'constructed', 'one', 'series', 'challenges', 'using', 'everything', 'lumber', 'wooden', 'horses', 'axes', 'athletic', 'funny', 'Tamblyn', 'own', 'Rall', 'Platt', 'Mattox', ""d'Amboise"", 'shine.According', 'Donen', 'MGM', 'placed', 'bets', 'Brigadoon', 'directed', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'was', 'being', 'shot', 'same', 'time', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'smash', 'MGM', 'executives', 'took', 'half', 'Donen', 'budget', 'gave', 'Minnelli', 'How', 'wrong', 'were', 'Brigadoon', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'disappointment', 'stagy', 'self-conscious', 'Nowadays', 'dated', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'just', 'took', 'off', 'Fifty', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'joy', 'watch', 'barn-raising', 'sequence', 'dance', 'classic', 'Donen', 'was', '27', 'when', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'was', 'released', 'Michael', 'Kidd', 'did', 'alright.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'crisp', 'colorful']",N/A

The Best Documentary About A Hollywood Musical Ever Made.See the ""Special Feature"" about how this movie was made...not available elsewhere, from what I can see......""Sobbin' Women"" (1997) Is The Best Documentary About A Classic Hollywood Musical Ever Made By Far.""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers "" (1954 MGM) starring Jane Powell and Howard Keel was originally filmed in 1953, was made ""inexpensively"" (cost was about 1/3 that of ""Brigadoon"" released in 1953 starring Gene Kelly), and was not expected to be a big hit or a major movie.Well, you just never know, eh?55 years later, in 1997, about a dozen of the major players part of this truly ""ensemble"" movie were gathered and interviewed for this incredible documentary about the making of ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" (1954 MGM), with scenes from the actual movie inter-cut between interviews of the now ""senior citizen"" characters.Almost all were quite young when the movie was made in 1953 (e.g. Producer Stanley Donen was 27 years old in 1953, most of the Brides and Brothers were in their 20's and several were in their teens...""brothers"" Russ Tamblyn, Jacques D'Amboise, and ""bride"" Ruta Lee were all teen agers.....the only ""older"" actor/ dancer in the movie was Ballet Russe veteran dancer Mark Platt was 41 in 1953....the oldest major cast member of all by far, and still living in 2012 at age 98!).Nobody who treasures major Hollywood musicals over history should miss this documentary about one of the best musicals ever made at any time.The story the documentary film tells is riveting, and so are the people.Actresses who played ""brides"" are interviewed, and several (Julie Newmar and Ruta Lee) are still spectacular, movie star level beauties in 1997 with astonishing ability to compel attention with their words, their simple gestures, and their still breathtaking pulchritude....that means beauty from the Latin word ""pulchra,"" which means beautiful!).Michael Kidd created the dances for the movie, and is interviewed during the documentary. He didn't see, originally, how the movie could be a dance movie at all....originally planned only to ""stage"" the singing segments without actual and formal dancing.All this changed, and the movie became one of the great dance movies of all time.You just never know, do you? The entire movie was shot in only 47 days.....""inexpensive"" movies in the present era (2012) are shot in that amount of time.The famous ""barn dance"" sequence was shot in only 3 days after about 4 weeks of rehearsal.The ""wood cutting"" song and dance sequence (set at the brothers' farm outside in the snow, sung by the lonesome brothers who miss their girlfriends and future brides, and sing of their loneliness while swinging axes and sawing wood on their farm) was shot without a single cut. The entire sequence was done in one take without turning the camera off.Very fancy filmmaking.Two entirely different versions of the movie were shot, one in widescreen ""Cinemascope"" and another in conventional 35 mm film.Two entirely different performances were given by the movie's actors and dancers. Two entirely different filming's of the movie were created by the technical staff. Enthusiasts interested in ""Seven Brides"" will interested to view and compare the two versions (both are available on the 50th Anniversary 2004 DVD release of the movie, along with the ""Sobbin' Women"" documentary.....which is not sold separately, sadly).The later is almost never seen or shown. The ""non-wide screen"" version available on most videos of the movie is taken from the Cinemascope version. The ""conventional aspect ratio"" version was meant to be shown in movie houses not equipped with wide-screen, Cinemascope lenses, since Cinemascope was only introduced into USA movie theaters the year ""Seven Brides"" was filmed (1953).Both the ""Sobbin' Women"" documentary and the ""second and completely separately shot"" version of ""Seven Brides"" in the ""conventional aspect ratio version"" are available in a DVD package released in 2004, the 50th anniversary of the the release of ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" (1953 MGM).The ""Sobbin' Women"" (1997) documentary about ""Seven Brides"" and how it was made as told by ""players"" who were there is so good, it should be sold separately, made available for sale as a separate item.Currently (2012), it appears the documentary is available only by purchasing the 2004 DVD ""50th Anniversary"" release of the movie in both the wide-screen, and the separately shot (and performed) conventional aspect ratio version.There are so many good things about the ""Sobbin' Women"" (1997) documentary, it is hard to list them all, remember them all.If is a treasure.

The accompanying `making-of' documentary shows how Michael Kidd cleverly made is so that the macho brothers didn't actually dance much unless it was appropriate, instead he had them jumping and moving to time. Interviews with most of the main cast members and director Stanley Donen make this an interesting extra, even if short at 35 minutes. There's also a trailer and subtitles (ideal if you plan to sing-along!).The techniocolor works very well in this restored version, particularly with the brightly coloured shirts the brothers wear and the pastel shade dresses worn by the brides.

Russ Tamblyn as one of Howard Keel's brothers and Julie Newmar as one of the potential brides are very memorable. Besides Michael Kidd's brilliant choreography (which almost goes without saying) is Cinematographer George Folsey's CinemaScope photography that captured both the grandeur of the land (shot on MGM's back lot!) and the brilliant and bawdy dance numbers. Unfortunately it was shot in Ansco Color and not Technicolor which makes the images less vivid. Yet it does not hinder the film. I saw a recent interview with Jane Powell and she believed that MGM thought they had a real dud on their hands. Boy, were they wrong. Of the DVD versions I prefer the original MGM issue which had a 2.55 to 1 aspect ratio. The Warner Studios version is 2.35 to 1.

Then there was the whole part of where...you know...typical love potion...boy meets girl...likes her food...thinks she is cute...and asks her to marry him 5 minutes later.

138579,A8F2AZWB20X1H,0792837592,JLind555,"[2, 2]","Plutarch's history of the Sabine Women, as re-told by Adam Pontipee, goes something like this:""Tell ya 'bout them sobbin' wimmen,Who lived in the Roman days,It seems that they all went swimmin'While their men went off to graze,Well a Roman troop came ridin' byAnd saw them in their me-oh-my,So they took them all back home to dry,'least that's what Plutarch said.""And that's the basis for ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"", a bang-up joyous musical for everyone, even people who normally hate musicals. If the word ""musical"" conjures up a treacly mess of overstaged song and dance numbers that have scant relation to the plot, or even worse, a plot that is little more than an excuse to showcase some overblown song-and-dance talent, this movie might just change your mind. The film opened in 1954 as a sleeper, filmed mainly on a back sound stage in Hollywood (and it looks it in spots), and turned out to be one of the biggest hits of the year, nominated for an Oscar for best picture.Loosely based on Stephen Vincent Benet's ""The Sobbin Women"" and transported to Oregon Territory in 1850, so the opening screen tells us, ""Seven Brides"" brings us Howard Keel (and that gorgeous baritone) as Adam Pontipee, a backwoodsman who comes to town looking for a wife. The film starts off with a rousing number called ""Bless Yore Beautiful Hide"" in which Keel tells the audience ""I'd swap my gun and I'd swap my mule, 'Tho whoever took 'em would be one big fool, To pay your way through cookin' school, if'n you would say I do."" After rejecting a few prospects (""Purty and trim, but kinda slim, Heavenly eyes, but oh, that size""), he sets his eyes on Milly, played by the young Jane Powell (and her lovely soprano), and it's love at first sight. Back she goes with him to his homestead, little reckoning that keeping house for him and his six rowdy, unwashed brothers is part of the package deal. In no time at all she has them out of their moldering longjohns, washed, shaved and presentable, and they're off to a neighborhood barn-raising, where they fall in love with six local belles; trouble is, they're already spoken for. It looks like a long, lonely winter ahead (as one of the brothers sings, ""A man can't sleep, when he sleeps with shee-e-e-eep""). Not to worry, Adam advises his brothers; the Romans knew how to handle their business:""Now when the menfolk went to fetch 'em,The women would not be fetched,It seems when the Romans ketch 'em,Their lady friends stay ketched.Now let this be,Because it's trueA lesson to the likes of you,Rough 'em up like them there Romans do,Or else they'll think you're tetched.""...and they're off to town to fetch the girls. The ensuing kidnap scene is hilarious, but returning home with their prizes, they discover a major boo-boo: somebody forgot to kidnap the parson. But after being snowed up on the hills for the whole winter (the brothers thoughtfully set off an avalanche to block the pass behind them in order to prevent any rescue party from reaching the girls till spring), by the time spring finally comes, marriage is on everybody's minds, and the brothers are married off to their women in a mass shotgun wedding. As in all good musicals, we can imagine they all lived happily ever after.Okay, so it's a corny plot, and if plot were all, there wouldnt be much to this movie; but the characters are so delightful you can't help being charmed by them. Chief of them all is Milly, winningly played by Jane Powell; she was married to be little more than a wife/servant, but she soon shows what she's made of. When the brothers wolf down the first meal she cooks them like pigs, she overturns the table and the dishes on their heads. She gets them out of their malodorous winter underwear by sheer coercion, threatening to barge into their room and rip it off them by force. She'd probably do it, too. And once she has them cleaned up and learning good table manners, she takes on the major task of teaching these louts some civility so they can compete for the local ladies. She's a perfect combination of wife/housekeeper/big sister. The song ""Goin' Courtin'"" where she teaches the brothers how to spark a lady is hilarious.The casting for the six brothers was excellent. Given biblical names by their mother in alphabetical order, after Adam they are Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank(incense) (""'cause he smelled so sweet"") and Gideon. They're all handsome, hunky and personable, and except for Benjamin, they all dance up a storm. Benjamin, played by the late Jeff Richards, doesn't dance, sing, or do much acting, either, but he's so gorgeous all he has to do is look good. Matt Mattox (Caleb) and Marc Platt (Daniel) were already personalities in the dance world before they were cast in this film. But the three to watch are the three youngest brothers, Ephraim (Jacques D'Amboise), Frank (Tommy Rall) and Gideon (Russ Tamblyn). D'Amboise, only 20 when this film was made, was already a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, and Rall had performed in several musicals as well as being a featured dancer with the American Ballet Theater. Russ Tamblyn, who later starred in the film version of ""West Side Story"", had a background in gymnastics rather than dance, but some of his dancing in this movie is so incredible he seems to defy gravity.Which brings us to the dancing. Holy moly, the dancing! The musical numbers in most musicals, no matter how well they are done, are often a major irritant; it's as if the director is saying ""Stop the story, it's time for another song/dance."" But in this film, Michael Kidd's breathtaking choreography is woven so seamlessly into the story that it's an integral part of it. One of the most hauntingly beautiful song/dance numbers I've ever seen in any film is ""Lonesome Polecat"", when the six unmarried brothers, chopping wood in a snowstorm, lament the long lonely winter ahead of them; the movements are so precise and so intricate they are almost balletic. The major dance production is the barn-raising scene, featuring five of the brothers, the local girls, and their townie boyfriends dancing up a storm. They look like they're having the time of their lives and we have a ball watching them.As for the rest of the casting, the actresses playing the six girls are all pretty and talented; look out for the young Julie Newmar, later of ""Catwoman"" fame, as Benjamin's girl Dorcas; but this film is definitely the brothers' movie. They throw themselves so exuberantly into this film that they're a joy to watch. My favorite scene in the whole movie is when they burst out of the barn on their way into town to kidnap the girls, bellowing at the top of their lungs:""Oh the women were sobbin', sobbin', sobbin' tears by the ton,But remember what Robin, Robin, Robin Hood woulda done:We'll be just like them there Merry MenAnd make them merry once again,And though they'll be a-sobbin' for a while,We're gonna make them sobbin' women SMILE!""Only a total grinch could keep from smiling as well.Judy Lind",5,The best American musical ever made,966556800,"08 18, 2000",2000,7009,"['Plutarch', 'history',

The barn-raising scene alone is worth the price, with the brothers performing Michael Kidd's athletic choreography brilliantly, albeit in pastel shirts that were probably never really seen in the Oregon wilderness. The musical score is basically good, although it will never give Rodgers and Hammerstein a run for their money.Another highlight is the 'Lonesome Polecats' number, in which the brothers sing of their ""loneliness"" out there in the snowy forest, whilst chopping wood and holding firm axes. The symbolism is subtle, and certainly does not threaten the film's family-friendly tone. Also notable is the ""Sobbin' Women"" number, with Howard Keel in fine voice.Indeed, Keel is outstanding in his role as the eldest brother, full of swagger and arrogance, while Russ Tamblyn and Tommy Rall stand out in their roles as two of the younger brothers, dancing up a storm and clearly having fun. Jane Powell shines in the rather thankless role of Keel's bride, her lovely soprano voice often better than the actual songs she is singing.Also be on the lookout for a young Julie Newmar as one of the future ""brides"".DVD transfer is good, considering the source (Ansco color is certainly not Technicolor), and the DVD includes the rarely-seen alternate filming in VistaVision, as well as some cast interviews.A great addition to any collection of classic movie musicals.",4,Lonesome polecats.,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,1451,"['fairly', 'low-budget', 'musical', 'MGM', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'dancing', 'film', 'barn-raising', 'scene', 'alone', 'price', 'brothers', 'performing', 'Michael', 'Kidd', 'athletic', 'choreography', 'brilliantly', 'pastel', 'shirts', 'were', 'probably', 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'Oregon', 'wilderness', 'musical', 'score', 'basically', 'good', 'will', 'never', 'give', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'run', 'money.Another', 'highlight', ""'Lonesome"", 'Polecats', 'number', 'brothers', 'sing', 'loneliness', 'there', 'snowy', 'forest', 'whilst', 'chopping', 'wood', 'holding', 'firm', 'axes', 'symbolism', 'subtle', 'certainly', 'not', 'threaten', 'film', 'family-friendly', 'tone', 'Also', 'notable', 'Sobbin', 'Women', 'number', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'fine', 'voice.Indeed', 'Keel', 'outstanding', 'role', 'eldest', 'brother', 'full', 'swagger', 'arrogance', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'Tommy', 'Rall', 'stand', 'out', 'roles', 'two', 'younger', 'brothers', 'dancing', 'up', 'storm', 'clearly', 'having', 'fun', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'shines', 'rather', 'thankless', 'role', 'Keel', 'bride', 'lovely', 'soprano', 'voice', 'often', 'better', 'actual', 'songs', 'singing.Also', 'be', 'lookout', 'young', 'Julie', 'Newmar', 'one', 'future', 'brides', '.DVD', 'transfer', 'good', 'considering', 'source', 'Ansco', 'color', 'certainly', 'not', 'Technicolor', 'DVD', 'rarely-seen', 'alternate', 'filming', 'VistaVision', 'as', 'well', 'cast', 'interviews.A', 'great', 'addition', 'collection', 'classic', 'movie', 'musicals']",N/A

Many years passed before we saw you on VHS as Frank Butler in the George Sidney version of Annie Get Your Gun, one of your very best parts, delayed for eons due to legal complications with the Berlin estate.  And only recently thanks to the miracle of DVD have we seen the second, ""flat"" version of SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS, the movie in which you played Adam Pontipee and made us laugh and cry out for more, your signature role.We liked you in SHOWBOAT and JUPITER's DARLING and so many more, and even in your non-singing parts like The DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (scary!) and THE BIG FISHERMAN (kind of religious, and the very first movie I remember ever seeing).

138607,A1Z2MZ9DV1K74T,0792837592,Lawrence Rapchak,"[9, 12]","Many people consider this great film to be the product of a sexist, male-dominated culture, where women are subservient creatures, whom men can use and abuse as they see fit.But one must TAKE A SERIOUS, CAREFUL LOOK AT THE FILM...and above all, LISTEN to the dialogue!There are THREE MOMENTS when Millie (Jane Powell) clearly articulates the heart and soul of the story: 1.)Near the beginning, riding in the wagon with Howard Keel when she talks briefly of familiy things (""I'd like to be wearing something that belonged to your mother..."")2.) In the middle of the film, when she learns that Benjamin is planning on leaving the farm...she tells Howard of her ""dreams""...of all of the brothers married with families...""all visiting back and forth on Christmas and birthdays...""3.) Near then end....when Howard, CLEARLY A TRANSFOREMED MAN, holds his infant daughter for the first time, and Jane tells him that she wants to give the tot a ""bible name""....""picking up where your father left off.""These 3 moments reveal the true essence of the character AND THE FILM ITSELF.....Yeah...so Howard and his brothers are rough, ""slum-oxy backwoodsmen""...totally unaccustomed to relations with the fair sex....and Howard admits on his wedding night that a woman to ""work alongside him"" is of prime importance.....BUT THAT""S JUST THE REALITY OF THE TIME AND PLACE OF THE STORY...IT""S THE SET-UP...into which Millie becomes entangled....it's a nightmare for her inititally. But notice, incidentally, how Howard was JUST ABOUT TO TELL HER the truth about his home life when she bursts into song with ""Wonderful Day""....he at least had enough conscience to consider letting her know what was in store once they arrived at the farm, but he crapped out.  Not very manly, of course,  but, never fear....he WILL BECOME A TRUE, STRONG LOVING MAN by the end of the film!The brilliant scripting and direction of ""7 Brides"" allows Millie to formulate her ""plan"" for the brothers, and then carry it out. On her first morning there, she succeeds in getting them all cleaned up, acting decently at the breakfast table, and lets them know that their new ""big sister"" is going to help them meet the girls in town.EVERY SCENE that follows lets these ideas unfold beautifully: Millie's deep and mature love as she deals with her husband's  domineering, insensitive ""old world"" idea of marriage; the brothers and their plight to win the town girls while trying THEIR BEST TO RESIST THEIR IMPULSE TO FIGHT any time they feel threatened (note how Millie ""defuses"" things during the big dance by intercepting Tommy Rall just as he's about to start a fight....she coaxes them to use their terrific physical DANCING skills to win the women, as opposed to their FIGHTING skills); the townsmen's hatred of the Pontipee brothers, which leads to the barn destruction;  the brother's frustration and loneliness which leads to Howard's desperately immature kidnap plan;  Millie's outrage, as she turns Adam and the boys out into the barn.....Gideon's visit to Adam at the cabin to let him know of the birth of his daughter...Gideon slugs his big brother, and almost gets the crap beat out of him for doing it. But that sock on the chin starts Adam thinking....It all makes such beautiful, logical sense.  MILLIE is the spiritual, emotional guiding light of this story: strong-willed, steadfast, warm, loving, mature....and SHE WINS...the big, macho Adam yields to HER, accepting the petite Millie on HER terms, embracing HER values, HER views on what makes a loving union between man and wife.PLUS..there's great music and dancin' to boot!!  Only the near-fatal silliness of the final scenes....the uniquely brilliant song ""SPRING, SPRING, SPRING"" is almost a total throw-away, complete with LOUSY vocal dubbing....and the near farcical final chase scenes in the barn, etc.,  keep this great film from the 5-star rating in my opinion.But I still love it, and the DVD looks and sounds GREAT!!  And who ever would have thought that we would be able to see the complete ALTERNATE VERSION of the film, photographed shot-by-shot alongside the familiar Cinemascope version?! What a treat!So forget all of the knee-jerk feminist condemnation of this film...

It was released in 1954 so it will seem very outdated to many viewers.  But it is one of most enjoyable, lively, colorful, engaging, uplifting musicals I've seen.Howard Keel (Adam) is an absolutely fantastic singer, and not bad to look at.  Jane Powell (Millie) is a perfect compliment to him.  Adam leaves his mountain home one day to go to town to &#34;find a wife&#34;.  He's determined not to return home without one.  He sees Millie, decides she's the one, woos her for about 10 minutes, they are married by the justice of the peace and off they go.  She has no idea that he's taking her home to a rambunctious and raucous brood of 6 grown, redneck brothers.The rest of the story is funny, tender, ironic and lively.  There is no murder, gore, swearing or immorality.  There is a kidnapping scene (which happens to be very comical), but it's put right by Millie and her determination to keep things proper.The music and dancing are AMAZING.

138616,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0792837592,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[6, 6]","A huge backwoodsman comes into town one day, looking at all the unmarried women in town.  The next thing you know he has found a woman who wants to marry him, they get hitched and they head for his home in the mountain.  The man is Adam Pontipee, played by Howard Keel.  The woman is Milly Pontipee, played by beautiful Jane Powell.  Of course Adam's search for a bride is accompanied by a song and glares from many of the townspeople.When Milly returns to Adam's cozy little cabin in the woods she discovers that Adam has six younger brothers, and Adam seems to expect Milly to be a combination wife and mother to all of them.  Milly quickly puts everyone straight as she turns the heathen brothers into a semblance of respectability.The six brothers begin to think that they should get wives for themselves.  Their manly juices flow when they visit town and instantly fall into love.  Unfortunately, the local town lads have other ideas about their women, and having them head up into the mountains are not part of those ideas.After Milly reads the seven brothers a story about the Sabine women, the brothers convince themselves that they need to bring the women into the mountains.  The brothers head off to town and manage to round up six women with whom they have fallen in love.  However, the girls do not take kindly to being kidnapped and put up a huge fuss.  The chase is on as the boys head back to their mountain home with the townsmen hot on their heels.  Fortunately, the women aid in halting the pursuit, but now they are stuck in the mountains until spring.Though the kidnapping is even more politically incorrect now than it was then, the story works because Milly keeps the lads in line and because the boys are very innocent.  A viewer has to wonder how this movie will turn out (if you have not seen it before), because the boys have not thought through what will happen when the snow thaws in the spring.This musical is from the era when musicals were popular and successful.  This particular musical is one of the best of the era with a fast-paced and humorous story and great choreography.  I also recommend getting the 2.55:1 aspect ratio over full screen or the 1.77:1 aspect ratio.  Of course, you need a larger television for the bigger aspect ratio.  However, with full screen, which requires pan and scan, you lose so much of the picture that much of the story is lost.There are several versions of this movie available.  There is a two disk version that has both the 2.55:1 and 1.77:1 aspect ratios.  That version also has a number of extras that some fans may find interesting.

I have seen them all, and I still love this one best. The music is not just fun or well-written - the love songs are passionate and the dance numbers are rollicking. Howard Keel is a dashing redhead and his voice makes me melt, Jane Powell is so pretty and such a charming leading lady. The brothers and the town girls all worked so well together. This was definitely written in a time when good performance was everything. I love each of the songs for a different reason. For example ""Bless Yore Beautiful Hide"" is just funny to me. No one would write a song like that anymore because it isn't 'PC' for a man to go into town, look over the potential women and pick his bride based on what he likes or doesn't like. I especially like it when Howard Keel's character, Adam Pontapee, is walking down the street and commenting on every girl that walks by. One is married, one gets engaged just as he introduces himself to her, one is pretty but too thin, another has heavenly eyes, but is a little to short and stout and then he sees Millie and 'she's the gal for him'.I wish I could type a review for each and every song in the musical. I love them all and could probably sing every single word. ""Wonderful, wonderful day"" is beautiful, ""Goin' Courtin'"" is good advice for every man, the barn dance shows exactly what used to be REAL talent, I love ""June Bride"" for it's lovely melody and subtle references to popular songs of the time period that the story takes place in and ""Spring, Spring, Spring"" speaks about a simpler life and time, when after a long hard winter, a changing of seasons was truly something to sing about.

I always liked it a lot and could confirm recently that the old magic still works. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.In the beginning was a short story, &#34;The sobbin women&#34;, written in 1926 by Stephen Vincent Benet (1898-1943), the man who also gave us the immortal classic &#34;The devil and Daniel Webster&#34;. The story was immediately spotted as good film material, but for various reasons it took almost 20 years to make a movie from it. As in the meantime films gained the speech and color, this long wait was finally a good thing, as was the idea to change the initial story into a highly humorous musical.Oregon Territory 1850. Adam Pontipee (Howard Keel), a farmer living in an isolated valley in the mountains, comes to town to trade - and, as in many earlier occasions, also look for a wife... This is a daunting task, because not only single young women are very few (and almost already are spoken for) but he also never can stay longer in town than one day at a time...But incredibly, this time he will get impossibly lucky - to the greatest annoyance of many a male in the town...))) His brand new wife Milly (Jane Powell), met, courted, won over and married in just one day, will go live with him in the mountains - where she will discover a big bad surprise... in fact, six of them...))) And then the film REALLY begins.There are many treasures in this film:- gentle, clever humour. TONS of it!- great songs. TONS of them!- one absolutely incredible dance (&#34;The Barn Building Dance&#34;), in which twelve handsome young men and six adorable young ladies play a complicated and merciless courting/mating/fighting ritual, without ever losing their smiles or missing one step (and that even if at one moment a huge axe gets involved) ...)))- a wonderful lesson in marital logistics, tactics and strategy- a great lesson about women decisive influence in progress of civilization and culture...)))- an absolutely unique lecture about early Roman history (with music!)...)))- one of the most glorious marriage scenes EVER!Other important reason to LOVE this film is that any feminist exposed to it will instantly screech in pain, then die and desintegrate into dust, as a vampire in full sunlight...)))Bottom line, this film is an absolute TREASURE, to buy, watch and keep for ever.

138627,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,0792837592,Mat,"[15, 30]","(...)Seven Brides for Seven Brothers is a pretty by the books MGM musical. It is based on a book entitled The Sobbin' Women which is in turn based on a Roman story titled The Rape of the Sabine Women. Which, like the title implies is about the kidnapping and rape of several young women who eventually come to 'love' their captors. How someone decided to make a musical out of this one wonders.The movie is very sexist. The oldest brother, Adam, sets out at the beginning of the movie to find a wife. He doesn't do this because he is lonesome, or loveless, or in need of company. No, he seeks a wife because he lives in the mountains with six brothers and they need someone to cook for them and clean up after them. Even his method of finding a wife is pretty awful. He comes to town on to shop for various goods and reckons to add a wife to that goods list. The remainder of the story focuses on the wife he finds, named Millie, and how she manages to turn the brothers into refined gentlemen. The original story figures in with a kidnapping plot designed to win the hearts of potential brides for the remaining single brothers.Sexist plot aside Seven Brides really does sparkle as a gem in the musical hat of MGM. This can be mainly attributed to some fine songs by Johnny Mercer (including the hillbilly charm of ""Bless Your Beautiful Hide"") and some incredible choreography by Michael Kid. The 'Barn Raising' scene is worth the price of the ticket alone. Add to that the subtle beauty of 'Lonesome Polecat' and you have a winner.I have personal memories of this film being watched in a dormitory lobby in college. Some bubbly friends of mine insisted that we had to watch it immediately after finding I had never seen it. They proceeded to quote most of the lines, sing every song and practically dance along with every scene. They did so with such energy that I was swept along as well, hardly paying attention to the jokes or the plot. Upon viewing it again I couldn't help remember that enthusiasm, but this time I was unable to miss the bothersome plot. In the end one must realize the time and place this movie came from without overlooking what is a pretty disturbing bit of plotting. The songs and the movements will most assuredly win most of the skeptics over though.(...)",3,Singing and Dancing,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,2285,"['Seven', 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'pretty', 'books', 'MGM', 'musical', 'based', 'book', 'entitled', 'Sobbin', 'Women', 'turn', 'based', 'Roman', 'story', 'titled', 'Rape', 'Sabine', 'Women', 'Which', 'title', 'implies', 'kidnapping', 'rape', 'several', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'eventually', 'come', ""'love"", 'captors', 'How', 'someone', 'decided', 'make', 'musical', 'out', 'one', 'wonders.The', 'movie', 'very', 'sexist', 'oldest', 'brother', 'Adam', 'out', 'beginning', 'movie', 'find', 'wife', ""n't"", 'do', 'lonesome', 'loveless', 'need', 'company', 'No', 'wife', 'mountains', 'six', 'brothers', 'need', 'someone', 'cook', 'clean', 'up', 'Even', 'method', 'finding', 'wife', 'pretty', 'awful', 'town', 'shop', 'various', 'goods', 'reckons', 'add', 'wife', 'goods', 'list', 'remainder', 'story', 'wife', 'named', 'Millie', 'how', 'turn', 'brothers', 'refined', 'gentlemen', 'original', 'story', 'figures', 'kidnapping', 'plot', 'designed', 'win', 'hearts', 'potential', 'brides', 'remaining', 'single', 'brothers.Sexist', 'plot', 'aside', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'really', 'sparkle', 'gem', 'musical', 'hat', 'MGM', 'can', 'be', 'mainly', 'attributed', 'fine', 'songs', 'Johnny', 'Mercer', 'including', 'hillbilly', 'charm', 'Bless', 'Your', 'Beautiful', 'Hide', 'incredible', 'choreography', 'Michael', 'Kid', ""'Barn"", 'Raising', 'scene', 'price', 'ticket', 'alone', 'Add', 'subtle', 'beauty', ""'Lonesome"", 'Polecat', 'have', 'winner.I', 'have', 'personal', 'memories', 'film', 'being', 'watched', 'dormitory', 'lobby', 'college', 'bubbly', 'friends', 'mine', 'insisted', 'had', 'watch', 'immediately', 'finding', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'proceeded', 'quote', 'most', 'lines', 'sing', 'song', 'practically', 'dance', 'along', 'scene', 'did', 'so', 'such', 'energy', 'was', 'swept', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'hardly', 'paying', 'attention', 'jokes', 'plot', 'viewing', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'remember', 'enthusiasm', 'time', 'was', 'unable', 'miss', 'bothersome', 'plot', 'end', 'one', 'must', 'realize', 'time', 'place', 'movie', 'came', 'overlooking', 'what', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'bit', 'plotting', 'songs', 'movements', 'will', 'most', 'assuredly', 'win', 'most', 'skeptics', 'though.']",N/A

When Adam returns to his dilapidated cabin with Milly (Jane Powell) as his wife, he sets his brother's minds and hearts awhirl with convoluted notions of doing the same. There's just one problem: the troupe is about as couth and gentile as that proverbial bull in the china shop. So Milly sets to work on molding gentlemen out of these ruffians.  MGM, the most lavish purveyors of musical entertainment quashed director, Stanley Donen's desire to film on anything beyond a soundstage, resulting in some pretty obvious looking sets and very claustrophobic staging. Regardless, the film abounds with riotous exuberance and rollicking charm. The outstanding sequence remains the ""Barn-Raising Ballet"" - a fifteen minute tour de force in which the brothers - newly polished up - take on the cultured town's men for the affections of the town's women and come up the undisputed winners.So too is Warner Brothers newly minted two disc special edition of this classic musical a winner. Featuring both the Cinemascope original (this time anamorphically enhanced for 16:9 displays) and a recently discovered 1:85:1 print, we get to see twice as much as before. Colors are rich, vibrant and bold. Contrast levels are bang on. Black levels are deep and solid. There's only the slightest amount of age related artifacts and minor edge enhancement to speak of. Neither will distract. The audio is dated by features a newly cleaned up and aggressive 5.1 mix.

I don't know if it was recently added, but I hadn't noticed it on Amazon prime before. I thought, that I would turn it on for just a moment to see how it looked after all these years. I was once again hooked and watched it through to the end for probably the 10th time. It's still as fresh as ever and I have my own ideas why.Musicals are known for their silly plot lines, and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers is one of the silliest, and it's rather sexist to boot. Then, again, the women teach the men a thing or two and all is forgiven because this film is such a joy to watch. It's full of energy and vitality.This film is in a rarefied atmosphere: Great musicals written for film rather than adapted from broadway. It is by far Johnny Mercer's most successful film as lyricist. Howard Keel and Jane Powell were huge musical stars. But, these aren't what makes this film great.It's one of the first musicals filmed in CinemaScope and it is simply beautifully filmed. The great outdoors with the mountains and snow are glorious. While Brigadoon was being filmed at the MGM studios lot, Seven Brides was mostly being filmed on location in Utah. I believe this is one of the reasons Seven Brides was more popular at the time, received more awards, and has stood up to the test of time far better than Brigadoon. Spectacular scenery on a wide-screen is almost always a winner and it buried Brigadoon's fake Scottish highlands in an avalanche.It's a musical with great songs, but the dancing choreographed by Michael Kidd is the real star. I recognized New York City Ballet's Jacques D'Amboise the first time I saw Seven Brides. I could see that the dancing was spectacular. What I didn't know was that, at Kidd's insistence, Jacques D'Amboise and other dancers were cast as the brothers - with the exception of Russ Tamblyn who was a gymnast, and Jeff Richards, another brother who was a baseball player turned actor. The brides were dancers, too -- including Julie Newmar in her first film (did you know she was trained as a ballet dancer? I didn't until recently.)Who ever heard of a dance number done with axes? Seven Brides has one.The real show stopper and the heart of this film is the dancing at the barn-raising. There has never been a dance number filmed with such athleticism and ingenuity before or since. I don't know this to be the case, but watch West Side Story again after watching Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I'm sure Jerome Robbins must have been influenced by Michael Kidd's choreography.Whether you're a fan of musicals or not, give Seven Brides for Seven Brothers a try.",5,FIVE STARS!

It is also the story of a rugged young farmer, in 1850, who rides into town to trade for some supplies, and pick himself up a comely bride...In town, Adam finds just what he's looking for--'Pretty and trim, but not too slim. Heavenly eyes and just the right size. Simple and sweet and sassy as can be.' Adam meets the young spirited Milly working at a local inn... He is instantly attracted by her good looks and her cooking... For her part, Milly likes her tall, and self-assured man... Also his directness, and the sound of his good house in the wilderness... After a whirlwind courtship, the two agree to wed...Millie chirps an engaging 'Wonderful, Wonderful Day' as she welcomes what she expects will be a perfect new life... But when she arrives at the ranch, all her dreams about love and marriage and such, are shattered... She discovers that her new husband has not been entirely truthful... Instead of an idyllic honeymoon cottage just for two, she finds he really wants 'a cook, a washerwoman, a hired girl,' for his small army of six sensitive brothers living in one filthy cabin...After the shock, Milly immediately sets out to transform the young rowdy men into the region's most eligible bachelors, with an eye to marrying them off as quickly as possible...Milly's good cooking and stubborn nature inspire the rambunctious young men that they cannot expect to attract wives if they dress and behave the way they do... They have to learn some social graces... At the perfect opportunity, the boys put Milly's teaching to good use, meeting the town girls whose glances express an obvious interest...Unfortunately, the women are spoken for..Adam could hardly believe it how his little wife tamed his backwoods brothers... He suggests to the wild and grieving 'Romeos,' reduced to what he can only describe as ""a bunch of mamma's boys,"" forget gentle methods of love, and kidnap the unwilling gals they want, following the actions of the Roman with the Sabine women...Howard Keel is at his commanding best... He develops an unorthodox solution to his brothers loneliness, much to the chagrin of the town fathers and their romantic rivals... With a voice singularly warm and precise, he rises magnificently to the occasion, singing a firmness 'Bless Your Beautiful Hide,' while he appraises the qualities of womanhood in general...In her probably best screen performance, Jane Powell had the required amount of grit and spunk that was needed to lay the woman who could tame seven backwoodsmen... She sets about to refine her unkempt brothers-in-law giving them the manners and habits they need to court and to win their own sweethearts... Her clear, high, spring-water voice is just right for the songs, seemingly meant to be heard in the open with the mountains and meadows to echo it...Unquestionably, the highlight of the motion picture is justly the 'Barn-raising' sequence... It begins as a 'challenge' dance--a truly breathtaking display of acrobatic leaps and ballet steps, in which the brothers compete for the girls with the more 'refined' men of the town, and it ends inevitably in a noisy, undignified fight as the men actually try to raise the four sides of the wooden barn...The collective presence of the six brothers is simply dynamic... All the players move rhythmically with grace and ease... Russ Tamblyn jumps both forward and backward over an ax held in his hands... Stanley Donen again displays his visual originality and creates a new style of musical, irresistible with its vitality and freshness, lovely to look at and hear...",5,Irresistible with its vitality and freshness...,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,3942,"['former', 'Broadway', 'dancer', 'choreographer', 'Donen', 'initial', 'encounter', 'MGM', 'was', 'choreographer', 'number', 'musicals', 'including', 'Girl', ""'Anchors"", 'Aweigh', ""'Take"", 'Me', 'Out', 'Ball', 'Game', ""'Nominated"", '5', 'Academy', 'Awards', ""'Seven"", 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'tells', 'story', 'seven', 'Pontipee', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'rough', 'lonely', 'existence', 'farm', 'Oregon', 'also', 'story', 'rugged', 'young', 'farmer', '1850', 'who', 'town', 'trade', 'supplies', 'pick', 'up', 'comely', 'bride', 'town', 'Adam', 'just', 'what', 'looking', ""'Pretty"", 'trim', 'not', 'too', 'slim', 'Heavenly', 'eyes', 'just', 'right', 'size', 'Simple', 'sweet', 'sassy', 'can', 'be', 'Adam', 'young', 'spirited', 'Milly', 'working', 'local', 'inn', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'good', 'looks', 'cooking', 'part', 'Milly', 'tall', 'self-assured', 'man', 'Also', 'directness', 'sound', 'good', 'house', 'wilderness', 'whirlwind', 'courtship', 'two', 'agree', 'wed', 'Millie', 'chirps', 'engaging', ""'Wonderful"", 'Wonderful', 'Day', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'new', 'life', 'when', 'ranch', 'dreams', 'love', 'marriage', 'such', 'are', 'shattered', 'new', 'husband', 'not', 'been', 'entirely', 'truthful', 'Instead', 'idyllic', 'honeymoon', 'cottage', 'just', 'two', 'really', 'cook', 'washerwoman', 'hired', 'girl', 'small', 'army', 'six', 'sensitive', 'brothers', 'living', 'one', 'filthy', 'cabin', 'shock', 'Milly', 'immediately', 'out', 'transform', 'young', 'rowdy', 'men', 'region', 'most', 'eligible', 'bachelors', 'eye', 'marrying', 'off', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'Milly', 'good', 'cooking', 'stubborn', 'nature', 'inspire', 'rambunctious', 'young', 'men', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'attract', 'wives', 'dress', 'behave', 'way', 'do', 'have', 'learn', 'social', 'graces', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'boys', 'put', 'Milly', 'teaching', 'good', 'use', 'meeting', 'town', 'girls', 'glances', 'express', 'obvious', 'interest', 'Unfortunately', 'women', 'are', 'spoken', 'for..Adam', 'could', 'hardly', 'believe', 'how', 'little', 'wife', 'tamed', 'backwoods', 'brothers', 'wild', 'grieving', 'reduced', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'bunch', 'mamma', 'boys', 'forget', 'gentle', 'methods', 'love', 'kidnap', 'unwilling', 'gals', 'want', 'following', 'actions', 'Roman', 'Sabine', 'women', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'commanding', 'best', 'unorthodox', 'solution', 'brothers', 'loneliness', 'much', 'chagrin', 'town', 'fathers', 'romantic', 'rivals', 'voice', 'singularly', 'warm', 'precise', 'magnificently', 'occasion', 'singing', 'firmness', 'Beautiful', 'Hide', 'qualities', 'womanhood', 'general', 'probably', 'best', 'screen', 'performance', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'had', 'required', 'amount', 'grit', 'spunk', 'was', 'needed', 'lay', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'tame', 'seven', 'backwoodsmen', 'refine', 'unkempt', 'brothers-in-law', 'giving', 'manners', 'habits', 'need', 'court', 'win', 'own', 'sweethearts', 'clear', 'high', 'spring-water', 'voice', 'just', 'right', 'songs', 'seemingly', 'meant', 'be', 'heard', 'open', 'mountains', 'meadows', 'echo', 'Unquestionably', 'highlight', 'motion', 'picture', 'justly', ""'Barn-raising"", 'sequence', ""'challenge"", 'dance', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'display', 'acrobatic', 'leaps', 'ballet', 'steps', 'brothers', 'compete', 'girls', 'more', ""'refined"", 'men', 'town', 'inevitably', 'noisy', 'undignified', 'fight', 'men', 'actually', 'try', 'raise', 'four', 'sides', 'wooden', 'barn', 'collective', 'presence', 'six', 'brothers', 'simply', 'dynamic', 'players', 'move', 'rhythmically', 'grace', 'ease', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'forward', 'backward', 'ax', 'held', 'hands', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'again', 'visual', 'originality', 'new', 'style', 'musical', 'irresistible', 'vitality', 'freshness', 'lovely', 'look', 'hear']",N/A

The music is great, the colors bright and vivid, the choreography wonderful.To our modern eyes, the story of this 1954 musical seems a little outdated--the attitudes towards women are somewhat distasteful. Howard Keel's character, Adam, needs someone to clean and cook for his household of 6 wild brothers, so he just goes into town and ""acquires"" a wife, poor Millie (Jane Powell) who has no idea what is in store for her.When the boys decide they need wives, they just go into town, kidnap a batch of girls, beat the girls' boyfriends insensible, and spend the winter snowbound with the girls who miraculously fall in love with them. OK, well then...But, the charm of this musical somehow allows us to overlook all of this, and Millie's sheer spunkiness in trying to tame these wild men redeems them somehow. So everyone learns his lesson and all ends well.This musical is also interesting in that it showcases several young talents who became better known in later years: The character of Dorcas is played by Julie Newmeyer (a young Julie Newmar, Catwoman in the TV series Batman in later years), Russ Tamblyn (future star of West Side Story), and Ruta Kilmonis (later semi-celebrity Ruta Lee). Even in this very early outing, Julie Newmar's distinctive voice and looks make her stand out.The director, Stanley Donen, directed some of the best musicals in the 50s, including Damn Yankees, Singing in the Rain, Kismet (uncredited), and Royal Wedding.

138673,AR1T36GLLAFFX,0792837592,Scott FS,"[2, 2]","'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers' is notable for the rousing score with an unbelievable, long and impressively choreographed 'barn raising' scene.  Shot on a budget cut in half (the balance going to MGM's other musical of 1953, 'Brigadoon', 'Seven Brides' (originally 'Sobbin Women', then ""A Bride for Seven Brothers, which sounded too risque back then) turned out to be a huge hit for MGM, surprising everyone but the cast and crew of the film.Based on a story by Stephen Vincent Benet entitled 'Sobbin Women', itself a parody of the famous legend, the Rape of the Sabine Women, made famous by paintings by several different artists, including Schonfeld and Poussin, 'Seven Brides' is a fun and light-hearted tale of love, innocent longing, and taming the wild beasts of the mountains.The incomparable Howard Keel (Kiss Me Kate, Show Boat, Annie Get Your Gun) plays Adam Pontipee, the eldest brother of the family.  On their own, they've moved to the Oregon wilderness in 1850.  They start farming and ranching, and seem on their way to becoming very successful.  Only one problem.  They have no women folk to make them gentlemen.  Adam goes into town one day, and gets a notion to find a wife.  Despite there being ten men for every woman, he gets it into his head to not only find a woman, but marry her that very day, in fact, within a few hours.  He spies some likely candidates, but they're either too fat, too thin, or not sturdy enough.  But, he spies Jane Powell (Milly) chopping firewood, and cooking up a mess of eats for the bar in which she works.  Ah!  She can work hard, cook, milk a cow, and is easy on the eyes.  Adam proposes marriage, immediately.  He explains that back east, it would have take years before he could ask her father for her hand.  But since he lives 12 miles outside of town, he might not get back for months.  Improbably, they get married.  It's only when she gets to his cabin does she realize that there are not one, but seven brothers to contend with.The music is very good; 'Seven Brides' was nominated for five Oscars (including Best Picture), and won Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture (Adolph Deutsch and Saul Chaplin).  The two outstanding songs are ""Bless Yore Beautiful Hide"", which opens the movie, and ""Sobbin' Women"", both of which feature the superb baritone of Howard Keel.  Future stars Julie Newmar (Newmeyer here) and Russ Tamblyn (West Side Story, Twin Peaks) are one of the brides and one of the brothers, respectively.The not-to-be-missed barn-raising scene was shot over only three days, which is hard to believe when you watch the complexity of the scene.  As one of the actresses says, neither before or since have you had such an involved and exuberant dancing, leaping, throwing, sliding and all-around high energy goings-on in a film.Highly recommended.  Four and one half stars for this fun romp.  It will probably put a smile on your face; it certainly did mine.

The first song was good and a little funny and it helped shape up what the remainder of the movie would be about.From the start...Adam goes to town to find a wife. He is looking through town when he discovers Milly who is ""pretty and trim, but not too slim, heavenly eyed, and just the right size, gentle and sweet.."" (sorry I got carried away there....)He convinces her to marry him and that is where things pick up as they stop for the horses to drink. She sings a song (""Wonderful, Wonderful day"") among a set with that ""cloud Wall"" (but again, I didn't care, I was looking directly at her the whole time). She then arrives and discovers that Adam wasn't totally honest (and that she didn't assume) about his 6 brothers. She turns the tide quickly on them (in which was a very funny couple of scenes) as they learn well-needed manners and a change of it-seems weeks old longjohns. (If I had double ""X"" chromasomes I would continue on the subject.....LOL)(clearing throat, knuckle-cracking the hands) Ahem....moving on....They start asking moreabout the ""fairer sex"" when their first encounter with them didn't go too well (you care for some chewing tobacco...LOL) and one of them mops the floor with the townfolk. After the two lessons they decide to be nice and display their manners at a competition. This is one of the best scenes in the movie when they have a country version of a ""Dance-Off"" with the ""boyfriends"" of the girls that caught their eyes. The brawl breaks out shortly. The ""Sobbin Women"" song was okay but appearently the boys and Adam took it a little different way and decide to sneak up and kidnap the girls with some funny and clever ways! ""Meow"" ""Meow""  LOLAnother funny event is the brothers who are living in the barn getting attacked from the girls, but they soon fall for them. (I just wished it would happen in real life like that.......sigh) :(The Brothers learn a great lesson, (Adam learns his own harsh as well) about how women are supposed to be treated. I won't say how it ends but the commitment was there.This movie was great for the age in which it was in. Most of the cast were dancers (I'll go by their color shirts) like blue and red (Frank) along with manatory actors like orange. (If you see him, he is either sitting down when others are dancing or in the far screen during the dancing competition). The extras are worth it with commentary by a few of the cast members. The production costs were small for the movie but it was very successful.If you think ""I just told you the movie, why go get it now"" you're wrong. There is more then I mentioned. You will be wanting to watch it again and again.How said nice guys always finish last?

It was released the same year as Brigadoon, and since Gene Kelly and Cid Charisse were better known stars than Howard Keel and Jane Powell, it was assumed that Brigadoon would be the bigger hit. Director Stanley Donen had to make many compromises on the film that he believed sacrificed the quality of the overall picture. Yet the movie was a great success and is one of MGM's most beloved musicals. (All this information can be found in the additional track section of the DVD Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.)The story is rather implausible. Adam, and his six brothers Ben, Caleb, Dan, Ephraim, Frankincense, and Gideon, live alone in the Oregon back country. Adam decided to get a wife and Millie, a local girl agrees to take a chance with Adam. She gets more than she bargained for when she is expected to cook and clean for the seven barbaric men, but eventually she tames them. The six bachelor brothers deicide they too want wives and kidnap six other young ladies. Eventually the women fall in love with the men and all are married. Somehow the magic of the movie makes the viewer forget the complete political incorrectness of the film, and in reality the brothers should be facing criminal charges rather than marital bliss.Highlights of the film include the barn raising scene where one of Hollywood's greatest dance scenes takes place-the brothers compete fore the attention of the ladies with one of the most acrobatic square dances ever conceived. The lonely feel of ""I'm a Lonesome Polecat"" is very convincing. DVD viewers can get the benefit of the story behind the movie which gives the viewer an appreciation of the great musical films. All in all, this is a feel good film and definitely worth the price.",4,"Great musical Fun, albeit Corny Musical Fun",1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,1785,"['Seven', 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'film', 'surprised', 'MGM', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Brigadoon', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Cid', 'Charisse', 'were', 'better', 'known', 'stars', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'was', 'assumed', 'Brigadoon', 'would', 'be', 'bigger', 'hit', 'Director', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'had', 'make', 'many', 'compromises', 'film', 'believed', 'sacrificed', 'quality', 'overall', 'picture', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'one', 'MGM', 'most', 'beloved', 'musicals', 'information', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'additional', 'track', 'section', 'DVD', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'story', 'rather', 'implausible', 'Adam', 'six', 'brothers', 'Ben', 'Caleb', 'Dan', 'Ephraim', 'Frankincense', 'Gideon', 'live', 'alone', 'Oregon', 'back', 'country', 'Adam', 'decided', 'get', 'wife', 'Millie', 'local', 'girl', 'take', 'chance', 'Adam', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'expected', 'cook', 'clean', 'seven', 'barbaric', 'men', 'eventually', 'six', 'bachelor', 'brothers', 'deicide', 'too', 'want', 'wives', 'kidnap', 'six', 'other', 'young', 'ladies', 'Eventually', 'women', 'fall', 'love', 'men', 'are', 'married', 'Somehow', 'magic', 'movie', 'viewer', 'forget', 'complete', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'film', 'reality', 'brothers', 'should', 'be', 'facing', 'criminal', 'charges', 'rather', 'marital', 'bliss.Highlights', 'film', 'include', 'barn', 'raising', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'dance', 'scenes', 'place-the', 'brothers', 'compete', 'fore', 'attention', 'ladies', 'one', 'most', 'acrobatic', 'square', 'dances', 'ever', 'conceived', 'lonely', 'feel', ""'m"", 'Lonesome', 'Polecat', 'very', 'convincing', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'can', 'get', 'benefit', 'story', 'movie', 'viewer', 'appreciation', 'great', 'musical', 'films', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'definitely', 'price']",N/A

The lead actor has been in several musicals. Two that come to mind he acted opposite to Debbie Reynolds (she can DANCE and SING!) and played the part of a gambling establishment owner in &#34;Paint Your Wagon&#34;. Some scenes seem to 'drag', only because the concepts of cinematography and screen play writing was of a different mindset in the post war decades (more dialogue and no CG).

138696,A2IJKC3QH8XLSB,0792837592,vintageboy,"[10, 10]","I'm sure I'm not the only one who bought DVD titles of some of MGM's classic musicals, like ""American in Paris"", ""Brigadoon"", or ""Seven Brides"", when they were first released on the format, and were disappointed with the skimpy DVD treatment they got. No bonus scenes, no anamorphic transfer...these releases were pathetic.Now, thankfully, Warners seems to be re-releasing these titles in far more handsome and respectable issues. This release for ""Seven Brides"" is quite satisfying. Along with a lovely anamorphic transfer of the CinemaScope version of the film (in 5.1 audio), we also get the rarely screened alternate ""flat"" version of the film, which was filmed separately from the Scope version. That version is presented in Mono, although the music sequences seem to be in Stereo. It's interesting to do a comparison of the two versions, particualrly for the ""barn-raising' dance, to see how the two versions were framed for their respective film format ratios.As far as bonus features, we get the documentary on the making of the film, now expanded-upon from the previous versions, with extra interviews. It's well-done and worth watching. There are a couple montages of vintage MGM clips, one showing people attending the NYC premiere of the film, with voiceovers from those involved, and another montage shows MGM stars celebrating the studios 30th anniversary. I didn't find either of these to be that inspiring, but they are interesting. There is a running commentary with the film, but the coolest bonus feature (to me) was a short film made in CinemaScope, featuring the MGM orchestra playing selections from their music library. No doubt this film was made to demonstrate the wonders of Stereophonic Sound and CinemaScope...it's amusing to watch. I'm assuming this was run with the feature when first released.All in all, a very nice package, and hopefully we can look forward to more of the classic MGM musicals getting the royal treatment they deserve, in the future.",5,Finally!,1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,1983,"[""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'bought', 'DVD', 'titles', 'MGM', 'classic', 'musicals', 'American', 'Paris', 'Brigadoon', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'when', 'were', 'first', 'released', 'format', 'were', 'disappointed', 'skimpy', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'got', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'releases', 'were', 'pathetic.Now', 'thankfully', 'Warners', 'be', 're-releasing', 'titles', 'far', 'more', 'handsome', 'respectable', 'issues', 'release', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'lovely', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'CinemaScope', 'version', 'film', '5.1', 'audio', 'also', 'get', 'rarely', 'screened', 'alternate', 'flat', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'filmed', 'separately', 'Scope', 'version', 'version', 'presented', 'Mono', 'music', 'seem', 'be', 'Stereo', 'interesting', 'do', 'comparison', 'two', 'versions', 'particualrly', 'barn-raising', 'dance', 'see', 'how', 'two', 'versions', 'were', 'framed', 'respective', 'film', 'format', 'ratios.As', 'far', 'bonus', 'features', 'get', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'now', 'expanded-upon', 'previous', 'versions', 'extra', 'interviews', 'well-done', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'couple', 'montages', 'vintage', 'MGM', 'clips', 'one', 'showing', 'people', 'attending', 'NYC', 'premiere', 'film', 'voiceovers', 'involved', 'montage', 'MGM', 'stars', 'celebrating', 'studios', '30th', 'anniversary', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'inspiring', 'are', 'interesting', 'running', 'commentary', 'film', 'coolest', 'bonus', 'feature', 'was', 'short', 'film', 'made', 'CinemaScope', 'featuring', 'MGM', 'orchestra', 'playing', 'selections', 'music', 'library', 'doubt', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'demonstrate', 'wonders', 'Stereophonic', 'Sound', 'CinemaScope', 'amusing', 'watch', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'was', 'run', 'feature', 'when', 'first', 'released.All', 'very', 'nice', 'package', 'hopefully', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'classic', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'getting', 'royal', 'treatment', 'deserve', 'future']",N/A
