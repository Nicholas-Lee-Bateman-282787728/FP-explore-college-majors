But as he explained himself he learned his wordings and his pace later in his career. So this set show beautifully how George re-invented himself in this 20 year retrospect of his career (1977-2007). On the first discs he is kind of observing the environment and trying different things (weather man, seven words, baseball) but later on becomes more and more enraged by politics and such. But it's an interesting change and certainly for the better.A very big plus is that the shows were put on DVD with subtitles, that's fantastic. But I can't give it five stars simply because the set was released prematurely in 2007 and therefore his LAST show ever &#34;it's bad for ya!&#34; is missing in this collection. Sadly.

George Carlin was one of the greatest comedians of all time and he was so much more! Not only did he make us laugh until we cried, he also made some very intelligent and profound observations. With a comedy career spanning over 50 years, this Irish-American life erudite never walked on egg shells or pulled any punches!Sadly, he was only a few months away from receiving The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. I'm sure he was aware of how much he was loved and how special his brand of comedy is. I'm glad he went out on a high note with one of his funniest comedy specials ever!.....It's Bad For Ya!

I'm talking about stuff that will make your eyes sting after a while. The box itself is great as well as the bonus material, but throughout the first special as well as the third and fourth (and one or two more) there are these horizontal lines--a couple of dozens of them--occupying all of screen, and they're highyl visual and create striped blurs over the whole screen during sudden movement (the speed of movement that is required for a heavy blur to appear varies from disc to disc, but it's more obvious on close-up shots, and the first special suffers the most.) This unfortunate flaw really effects your mood while trying to concentrate on Carlin's shows...so a few of these discs have been exposed to some sort of digital over-compression, while a bit over half are just fine. Actually, on the ""George on George"" documentary on one of the two bonus discs, clips are shown from several of these specials, but the quality is crisp and clear, and you think to yourself ""why can't the actual shows on the other discs look this great?"" ...it's a shame. I own no other of Carlin's HBO shows separately, and don't know if most of the early ones suffer from this over-compression or whatever it is the way they do here, but I'm almost ready to buy one of them just to see if I can replace the discs in this set...but I suspect that these are just gathered discs of all already separately released DVD's....oh, and I don't think I have to explain anything about George Carlin and his stand-up for this product. He's a legend, and you know his stuff (you wouldn't be considering buying this pricey box if you weren't familiar with his comedy from before) ...I just wanted to be the first one to point out this unfortunate flaw.
