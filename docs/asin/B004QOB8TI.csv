He knows the true intentions of Jesus and what true love is.This film shows how we are truly connected with nature on a DNA level, we are one, connected and give off energy, our thought patterns and what we do affects nature and those around us, just give a 'sincere"" smile to someone who just cut you off and see them change from anger to either and ""ok"" mood or they change right away to peace, yet give them the finger back and their anger intensifies. See a man in the Army just returning home from Iraq and his kids and wife runs to him, you just have to smile and feel that love they are now sharing, yet you do not even know them...or do you??I have seen also a connection from those who have had a Near death experience and this film, Betty J. Eadie in her book ""Embraced by the Light"" said we and all things are spiritual first then physical. What we have on earth is a dim mirror reflection of what it's like on the other side, where colors are more vibrarent, are perseptions are greater, our understanding pure and all knowing. She (Betty) said she saw the earth and it's people and saw we all had a energy field we were giving off, positive thoughts gave off a soothing blue energy while anger gave off a more orange reddish energy. We draw and feed off this energy, I was amazed that this film also discussed this, the yogurt in the tray was a great example. I love this film, it's a masterpiece and it's also art, the colors and scenes and imagery are awesome, the director's side of Tom comes through very strong and the message is not lost at all of what he's trying to convey. This is a DVD to OWN, to watch many times over, whenever we get down or want to know agian, who we truly are, so show to friends or people who are hurting or just wondering, wondering about life, Love and God.So many will bash this film because it doesn't flow with their 1611 english King James bible or other religions in the world.

It was disappointing because there was really nothing new for me.  I've heard of the ideas of connectivity and the science backing it up so this film was rather dull.  The film talks little about whats wrong with the world and how to change it and instead talks a lot about life's purpose or the way we should be living life.  There were also very few scientific examples and its mostly just what a few famous people said and that must be the correct way of thinking or behaving.  And thats what really ruined it for me.

We cannot analyze, compare,contrast, measure and project realistically what we are even doing nowin a way that we can stand to look at.  The people who think they knowwhat is wrong are so positive, but they all disagree.The big shots interviewed in this documentary ... are they friends, orare they rivals ... if they are rivials, they are basically at war hoping thattheir rivals do to usurp their power, attention, money or fame, and thatis their primary goal.How can they possibly do anything to bring about change.  And if theydo get close and cost some people some money, what is going to reallyhappen?  The same thing that happened to John Kennedy?

In fact, I watched the ending twice and then immediately rewatched the first 20 minutes. This is a documentary that came to be after Tom Shadyac producer of Ace Venture and other silly comedies has a miraculous recovery from a devastating head injury and starts rethinking his life including his direction in the film-business. For I AM, he put a together a bunch of short interviews of him chatting with compassionate, enlightened, smart people intermixed with video clips, a bit on his own life story, a few experiential exercises, and music to deliver a powerful message. Accumulating massive wealth in excess of what one needs is presented rather than a life's goal, as a mental illness; excessive spending is akin to hoarding or eating to obesity. It doesn't lead to happiness but dissatisfaction. And, this living for oneself at the expense of others goes against the innate communal nature of human beings.One of the film clips showed an image that invoked parental feelings, with the question of who is my ""child"", my brother, my sister? How far is my reach of compassion? of responsibility? One of the people interviewed is Desmond Tutu who speaks about the South African concept of ubuntu (something we don't even have an English word for) which is the degree a person has relations and allegiances to others/humankind. (This concept is one focus of Tutu's book ""God Has a Dream,"" which I'm currently reading).I was a bit wary of the seemingly blasphemous film title ""I AM,"" but it is actually a play on words; the message here weaves in nicely to Christianity and other world religions too.

In a word, love. I am and I can make a difference.'This has been said before; it will be said again.

1425657,A35DSAZ6TD3J3W,B004QOB8TI,Marc Albert,"[0, 0]","In my opinion, it's too bad the content of the film's beautiful message and that of many of the viewer's comments here will be lost on most of the world's population.  Too many people are filled with some of the very characteristics the film portrays as ""what's wrong with the world""; greed, materialism, competitiveness and hate.  I believe we are presently at our zenith, if you can call it that, as a species and will be on the decline from here on.  The very skills and abilities that got us to this point as humans will be the source of our undoing and the raison d'tre of our decline and perhaps, extinction.  The Earth will go on very well without us, save for a super size asteroid, perhaps changed but it will reclaim itself and heal the damage we've done.I found the film both inspiring and depressing.  Inspiring in what could be and that there is some greatness and ""good"" in the world, but depressing in that there is much more evil, excess and greed.  The way events are progressing, our destiny is probably fated to end badly.  If you agree with the film's premise, you might say the human species will be part of a grand experiment that failed.  Or, you may conclude it is all part of evolution, particularly of the human race and in the end was destined to be unsuccessful.I give the film 5 stars for its goal in educating the people who watch it and its efforts to somehow turn things around.  Compare and contrast the commentators in this film with our country's politicians (U.S.), corporate CEO's, the world's leaders and maybe some of your own acquaintances, all of whom collectively, have the power to change the world's direction.  What a dismal thought this comparison is for most of us.As you can see, I am not optimistic about the human race and its future.  Those who are the ""haves"", rather than the ""have-nots"", will probably look on the film's makers, commentators and those who agree with its message as no more than a bunch of ""bleeding hearts.""  I think the film's detractors are wrong and guided by their own avarice, materialism and lack of compassion for others.  Their hearts are closed and their minds blinded.  Funny thing is, the film did demonstrate most convincingly that the heart, rather than the brain, is the seat of our feelings and empathy.If you look at history with complete honesty and objectivity, then you must conclude that now, overall, most of its populace are in the worst of times.  Are we inherently ""good"", or ""bad""?  We're all on the Titanic with a few in First Class, some in Second, and too many in Third Class.  This time there are no lifeboats at all, so ironically, everyone will go down with the ship if and when disaster hits.

1425660,A1YLU9NT0Q9H1V,B004QOB8TI,MJC,"[1, 2]","Thought-provoking film whose reason for being made is interesting in itself. Successful Hollywood director, Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura and Nutty Professor), gets into accident and develops post-concussive symptoms that make him face his own mortality and re-evaluate his own life. As a way of answering some questions that arise from this re-evaluation, he travels the globe interviewing prominent authors, religious leaders, and scientists. He asks two questions: What is wrong with our world? What can we do about it? Initially, the film is depressing, demonstrating the results of man's constant aggression and current over-the-top ""Greed is Good "" mentality. As the film progresses, the theme goes from separateness to connectivity. It approaches this connectivity in a novel way - demonstrating the scientific evidence of our connectedness. In doing so, the film has more weight than in a typical new-age connectedness theme. For example, the scene where the yogurt's bacteria responds to the Tom's emotions is effective and memorable. The effect Tom's research has on his own personal life also hits a chord. Tom's big screen experience helps make the film's montage and sound effective, subtle yet work well in the movie.After watching this film, I felt inspired to be more conscious my own actions, which can directly impact my own daily life as well as all life around me. Tom has certainly done his, in creating this film. If, like ripples of water, we each watch this movie, try to live its take-home message and encourage others to watch it, maybe we can eventually bring out the best in the human race on a large and daily scale.

This is a very uplifting film, and is NOT supposed to be a scientific flick. If you want one of those, go and rent The Living Matrix, or read some of Greg Braden's books.I AM is the story of a personal transformation of someone, who at the peak of his life, thought he had everything he could possibly want; Success, Wealth, Fame, Admiration, and yet, at the end of the day, that wasn't enough to make him happy. Through a series of interviews with viewpoints of different prominent (and some not as prominent) people from across the globe, he touches on the different cultures he encounters and how it made him aware that there is so much more to the life he's living. Only a small section of the film really involves him, as he shows the audience how the journey in the making of this movie is what prompted him to make changes to his life. As a result of these changes, he's a happier man, and being much more of service to others. Granted, it's hard to feel sorry for someone who is that famous and wealthy already, but he gives you a glimpse into his heart as he moves into his mansion, then closes the door at the end of the day and feels lonely.This movie was truly professionally filmed (how could it not be, in the hands of such an experienced movie maker). He shows joyous wonderful moments, like when the Dalai Lama rushes over to hug a young girl with such enthusiasm that is becomes a truly heart warming moment. Another scene of a little boy laughing at the camera, in sharp contrast with a little boy in africa with sadness on his face. Let's face it, life for the majority of people is a struggle.

1425669,A3E3SZ9H1BYYPD,B004QOB8TI,Piety Hill Booksellers,"[4, 4]","I wanted to like this movie. From the opening quotation from Emerson about looking beyond the pretense of life, Tom had my attention. But as this theme rolled along I became more and more frustrated. Allow me to paraphrase; &#34;We should pursue community&#34;, &#34;we have become too competitive as a society&#34;, &#34;we aren't living the right way&#34;.All I can think is, &#34;well duh&#34;. Really? This is the big insight? What I find most condescending is the myopic and ethnocentric approach of the film. Not all society globally has rejected community. In fact, most have not. Only an American (and I am one) would imagine that community is a dead concept. And not even every American has rejected community. Look at religious groups. Look at the Amish. Look at Mormons. Look at conservative Jews. My guess is that these groups don't fit Tom Shadyac's worldview very well. But make no mistake, these groups succeed because of their sense of community.Thankfully Tom's message doesn't seem to reject competition completely. And I did give the film two stars. But I get angry when it is a typical overachiever like Tom who suddenly realizes the error of his ways. Many of us NEVER WERE overachievers. Many of do live with a balanced view of competition. Some people like myself, while recognizing the merits of competition, have no interest in competition themselves. It is so typical to paint the world AS WE SEE IT.And the thing is, a documentary doesn't need to be a one-sided conversation. Balance is possible. In fact, a documentary fails completely when the audience nearly screams out the questions the filmmaker should be asking and answering himself.Tom avoided the harder route. He could have looked to various and competing points of view and then attempted to synthesize them. Instead he simply went to one side of the spectrum. It is his film and his right to do so. But it doesn't make for good movie making. And oddly, as some have pointed out, he assumed the synthesis of religious points of view where none exists. The closing quotation that &#34;I AM&#34; the problem with the world is a very western/christian way of thinking. It assume that the individual has control of his or her destiny. This goes against several religions (some even that are Christian). Don't get me wrong, I like this sentiment and in fact this one subject I agree with Tom on.My final frustration is the topic that Desmond Tutu most speaks to. The idea that &#34;family&#34; is this communal force we all require. And again, it isn't that he is wrong. But again my reaction was, &#34;well duh&#34;. Many Americans have know about how important family is. We don't need a condescending Hollywood millionaire to remind us.I suppose my opinion is pretty well laid bare. I just find it ridiculous that we need a man who has enough money that he can sit around all day philosophizing, telling the rest of us what we already knew to be true; that Community matters, that greed and materialism aren't the answer, that competition has some benefits but serious limits as well. You have to live in a bubble like Hollywood to not know this. To me it is like the drug addicts that finally get clean telling the rest of us to avoid drugs. Right. We all knew that. You didn't which is why YOU and not ME got strung out on drugs.I am glad Tom found himself. But don't assume because YOU found yourself that the rest of us have ever been lost.",2,Very Frustrating and Extremely condescending despite its good intentions,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,3431,"['wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'opening', 'quotation', 'Emerson', 'looking', 'pretense', 'life', 'Tom', 'had', 'attention', 'theme', 'rolled', 'along', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'frustrated', 'Allow', 'paraphrase', '34', 'should', 'pursue', 'community', '34', '34', 'have', 'become', 'too', 'competitive', 'society', '34', '34', 'are', ""n't"", 'living', 'right', 'way', '34', 'can', 'think', '34', 'well', '34', 'Really', 'big', 'insight', 'What', 'find', 'most', 'condescending', 'myopic', 'ethnocentric', 'approach', 'film', 'Not', 'society', 'globally', 'rejected', 'community', 'fact', 'most', 'have', 'not', 'Only', 'American', 'am', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'community', 'dead', 'concept', 'not', 'even', 'American', 'rejected', 'community', 'Look', 'religious', 'groups', 'Look', 'Amish', 'Look', 'Mormons', 'Look', 'conservative', 'Jews', 'guess', 'groups', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'worldview', 'very', 'well', 'make', 'mistake', 'groups', 'succeed', 'sense', 'community.Thankfully', 'Tom', 'message', ""n't"", 'seem', 'reject', 'competition', 'completely', 'did', 'give', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'get', 'angry', 'when', 'typical', 'overachiever', 'Tom', 'who', 'suddenly', 'error', 'ways', 'Many', 'NEVER', 'WERE', 'overachievers', 'Many', 'do', 'live', 'balanced', 'view', 'competition', 'people', 'recognizing', 'merits', 'competition', 'have', 'interest', 'competition', 'so', 'typical', 'paint', 'world', 'WE', 'SEE', 'IT.And', 'thing', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'one-sided', 'conversation', 'Balance', 'possible', 'fact', 'documentary', 'completely', 'when', 'audience', 'nearly', 'out', 'questions', 'filmmaker', 'should', 'be', 'asking', 'answering', 'himself.Tom', 'avoided', 'harder', 'route', 'could', 'have', 'looked', 'various', 'competing', 'points', 'view', 'then', 'attempted', 'synthesize', 'Instead', 'simply', 'went', 'one', 'side', 'spectrum', 'film', 'right', 'do', 'so', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'making', 'oddly', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'assumed', 'synthesis', 'religious', 'points', 'view', 'where', 'none', 'closing', 'quotation', '34', 'AM', '34', 'problem', 'world', 'very', 'western/christian', 'way', 'thinking', 'individual', 'control', 'destiny', 'several', 'religions', 'even', 'are', 'Christian', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'sentiment', 'fact', 'one', 'subject', 'agree', 'Tom', 'on.My', 'final', 'frustration', 'topic', 'Desmond', 'Tutu', 'most', 'speaks', 'idea', '34', 'family', '34', 'communal', 'force', 'require', 'again', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'again', 'reaction', 'was', '34', 'well', '34', 'Many', 'Americans', 'have', 'know', 'how', 'important', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'condescending', 'Hollywood', 'millionaire', 'remind', 'us.I', 'suppose', 'opinion', 'pretty', 'well', 'laid', 'bare', 'just', 'find', 'ridiculous', 'need', 'man', 'who', 'enough', 'money', 'can', 'sit', 'around', 'day', 'philosophizing', 'telling', 'rest', 'already', 'knew', 'be', 'true', 'Community', 'matters', 'greed', 'materialism', 'are', ""n't"", 'answer', 'competition', 'benefits', 'serious', 'limits', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'live', 'bubble', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'know', 'drug', 'finally', 'get', 'clean', 'telling', 'rest', 'avoid', 'drugs', 'Right', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'why', 'YOU', 'not', 'ME', 'got', 'strung', 'out', 'drugs.I', 'am', 'glad', 'Tom', 'found', 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'YOU', 'found', 'rest', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'lost']",N/A
