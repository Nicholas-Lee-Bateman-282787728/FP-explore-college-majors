530178,A2P3371V44C0L7,B00003CXO3,Aaron Elliott,"[1, 3]","I haven't seen the original GET CARTER, I must say this stands well on its own. I have liked many other Stallone movies (JUDGE DREDD, CLIFFHANGER, FIRST BLOOD, DEMOLITION MAN) but GET CARTER was a different movie.This movie is about a man who tries to come back to a family (his brother's) who he walked out on so many years ago. The only connection his niece has to him is a picture that sits around. But Jack Carter learns that his interrogating people only makes the people he's trying to get in touch with grow farther from him.But yet Jack does not stop his quest to prove that his brother did not die in an auto-accident. As he goes deeper into the world of filth under Seattle, Jack uncovers Cyrus Paice, a man who likes to project porn on the Internet for money.As Jack comes closer to the truth, he realizes that if he'd have been there when they needed them, none of this would have ever gone down. Jack begins to get in touch with his niece, and eventually develops a new sense of family and honor.I recommend this one for fans of PAYBACK, Stallone, Crime-dramas, or just somebody who likes good movies. This one is like the case of BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The reviewers hate it and people don't like it and it bombs. But I liked both this movie and BATTLEFIELD EARTH. But you'll have trouble finding it.

Both Mel and Sly make Their characters Far more Likeable, and in Doing so, they Lose what made the Originals Classic films.Sly's Carter is a Vegas Debt Collector who heads off to Seattle when his Brother Mysteriously dies. He meets a Lot of Sordid Characters on his little Holiday, including Miranda Richardson as Gloria Carter, Sly's Brothers Wife, Rachel Leigh Cook as Doreen Carter, Gloria's Daughter, the Wonderfully Smug Alan Cumming as Computer Genius Jeremy Kinnear, Michael Caine (whose presence only reminded me of the Superior Original) as the Shadowy Cliff Brumby, John C McGinley as Hometown Henchman Com McCarty, the Criminally Underrated Mickey Rourke as Cyrus Paice and the Stunning Rhona Mitra as Geraldine, Sly's Link to the Underground. They all give Restrained, Mature Performances that Perfectly Fit the Feel that the film is aiming for.The Scenes where Stallone and Rourke face off are worth Purchase Price Alone, I simply Could Not Choose who I wanted to come out on Top. They are Two of my Favourite Tough Guys. Gretchen Mol makes a Good Impression in a very small part. (an Extended Cameo that has Good Performances from her and Sly, but it Worked Better in the Original) Her scenes, as well as Rachel Leigh Cook's scenes, nearly all feature Sly, and they are the films Best Scenes, Acting wise.Action wise, the film is subdued. There are two well-staged Car chases that have been a little Over Edited, they still Achieve their Goal. Sly dishes out some Harsh Beatings, but the film never becomes a Full On Action film like Most of Sly's Resume. Fans of &quot;Copland&quot; should enjoy this, the two films share a lot in common, eg. Mood, Tone and Performances. In the End, the film is more of a Triumphant Return for Mickey Rourke than it is for Stallone...

530198,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXO3,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 2]","This is a mediocre remake of a 1971 film by the same name, with Sylvester Stallone inheriting the title role from Michael Caine (who also has a minor role in this film).  The screenplay has been updated to make it more techie (cyber porn, cell phones and internet billionaires).  Writer David McKenna (""American History X"") attempts to flesh out Carter a bit more and make him a nice guy in a bad profession.  Unfortunately, while that helps, the dialogue is uniformly bad and the characters are boringly stereotypical.Director Stephen Kay is creative with the camera, but adds excessive style without regard to substance.  He throws every technique ever invented into the frame in a flurry of strange camera angles, strobe effects and fast forward photography.  The result is a presentation that is more idiosyncratic than brilliant.  There is so much hand held photography that by the end of the film, the viewer has whiplash from trying to follow the action.  Speaking of action, there is not much of it.  There is a lot of talk, a few fistfights and one decent car chase and that is about it.  For a film that clearly targets a male audience, this film fails to deliver what guys want most.Stallone gives his standard tough guy performance, which is generally among the best in the business.  He is still in good shape at 54, but one has to wonder how much longer he can keep playing these characters before it becomes incongruous.  As has been the rule in remakes of late, the former Carter, Michael Caine is given a supporting role in this film.  Caine is excellent as the slime bag pulling the strings behind the scenes.  Rachel Leigh Cook also gives a fine performance as Carter's niece, and does an outstanding job in one poignant scene where she describes to her uncle how she was raped.  Alan Cumming plays a sniveling rich boy who made millions in technology and provides an almost comic contrast to Stallone's deadly seriousness.  Mickey Roarke provides his character with a sinister and despicable personality, and is still as tough as they come.  However, he is another actor whose thug days are numbered.I rated this film a 5/10.  Despite some good acting, a dull script is embellished with unnecessary directorial flourishes making it more annoying than entertaining .

530216,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXO3,Matthew Horner,"[8, 12]","Hollywood has remade movies for decades. When sound was introduced in the late 1920s, it was only logical to take some of the better silent movies and do them again. Cecil B. DeMille remade his 1925 movie The Ten Commandments in 1956 It is a timeless story and will no doubt be done again in the future. Some movies have great stories that are worth retelling. An example is A Star is Born which was first filmed in 1937. It was remade in 1954 and in 1976. Sometimes, a producer will buy the rights to a foreign film in order to do an English language version. Three Men and a Baby was a remake of a French film. All too often, however, remakes happen for reasons that are logical only to the people who decide to do them. Get Carter is one of those movies. The original an English film released in 1971. It starred Michael Caine, who also appears in the new version, perhaps as a reminded that, most of the time, what was successfully done in the past is best left there.Jack Carter, originally Caine's character, is this time played by Sylvester Stallone. Carter is a very bad man, which worked perfectly the first time around. Why the producers decided to tone the character down for modern audiences is beyond me. He is still unsavory, but that's not the same thing as being bad to the bone. The result is that this Carter is far less interesting.After working in Las Vegas for five years as a debt enforcer for a casino boss, Carter returns home to Seattle after his brother is killed in a car accident. He finds the circumstances of the death to be suspicious. A little checking around shows that some of the people the brother knew have a lot to hide. Soon, several of them have reason to fear Carter, who, after all, is all too familiar with their shady little world. The trick for Carter in this dark little thriller is to find out what his brother might have known that cost him his life.Get Carter is literally one of the darkest films I have seen in years. Director Stephen T. Kay wants to make sure we get in the mood of the story. I was yearning for a little sunshine long before the movie ended.I will note that Stallone gives a more subtle and nuanced performance than usual. If the producers were determined to do this remake, then Stallone was a good choice for the lead. Besides Caine, the movie also stars two of my favorite British actors - Miranda Richardson and Alan Cummin, both playing Americans. Richardson adds class to the picture, but her role is hardly a stretch for her. Add Cummin to a growing list of English actors who have learned how to play American villains better than Americans themselves. As a vain, self-centered zillionaire, Cummin's character is delightfully nasty.This movie is not the worst choice you could make to spend an evening with. Had the original never existed, reviewers probably would have been kinder. The fact is that it suffers by comparison. If you like your thrillers dark and on the nihilistic side, you might enjoy this, but if you can find a copy of the original, by all means watch it instead.",2,Classic Michael Caine actioner gets tepid remake,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,3059,"['Hollywood', 'remade', 'movies', 'decades', 'When', 'sound', 'was', 'introduced', 'late', '1920s', 'was', 'only', 'logical', 'take', 'better', 'silent', 'movies', 'do', 'again', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'remade', '1925', 'movie', 'Ten', 'Commandments', '1956', 'timeless', 'story', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'done', 'again', 'future', 'movies', 'have', 'great', 'stories', 'are', 'worth', 'retelling', 'example', 'Star', 'Born', 'was', 'first', 'filmed', '1937', 'was', 'remade', '1954', '1976', 'Sometimes', 'producer', 'will', 'buy', 'rights', 'foreign', 'film', 'order', 'do', 'English', 'language', 'version', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby', 'was', 'remake', 'French', 'film', 'too', 'often', 'however', 'remakes', 'happen', 'reasons', 'are', 'logical', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'decide', 'do', 'Get', 'Carter', 'one', 'movies', 'original', 'English', 'film', 'released', '1971', 'starred', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'also', 'new', 'version', 'perhaps', 'reminded', 'most', 'time', 'what', 'was', 'successfully', 'done', 'past', 'best', 'left', 'there.Jack', 'Carter', 'originally', 'Caine', 'character', 'time', 'played', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Carter', 'very', 'bad', 'man', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Why', 'producers', 'decided', 'tone', 'character', 'down', 'modern', 'audiences', 'still', 'unsavory', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'being', 'bad', 'bone', 'result', 'Carter', 'far', 'less', 'interesting.After', 'working', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'five', 'years', 'debt', 'enforcer', 'casino', 'boss', 'Carter', 'home', 'Seattle', 'brother', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'circumstances', 'death', 'be', 'suspicious', 'little', 'checking', 'shows', 'people', 'brother', 'knew', 'have', 'lot', 'hide', 'Soon', 'several', 'have', 'reason', 'fear', 'Carter', 'who', 'too', 'familiar', 'shady', 'little', 'world', 'trick', 'Carter', 'dark', 'little', 'thriller', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'brother', 'might', 'have', 'known', 'cost', 'life.Get', 'Carter', 'literally', 'one', 'darkest', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'Director', 'Stephen', 'T.', 'Kay', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'mood', 'story', 'was', 'yearning', 'little', 'sunshine', 'long', 'movie', 'ended.I', 'will', 'note', 'Stallone', 'more', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'usual', 'producers', 'were', 'determined', 'do', 'remake', 'then', 'Stallone', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'lead', 'Besides', 'Caine', 'movie', 'also', 'two', 'favorite', 'British', 'actors', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Alan', 'Cummin', 'playing', 'Americans', 'Richardson', 'class', 'picture', 'role', 'hardly', 'stretch', 'Add', 'Cummin', 'growing', 'list', 'English', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'learned', 'how', 'play', 'American', 'villains', 'better', 'Americans', 'vain', 'self-centered', 'zillionaire', 'Cummin', 'character', 'delightfully', 'nasty.This', 'movie', 'not', 'worst', 'choice', 'could', 'make', 'spend', 'evening', 'Had', 'original', 'never', 'existed', 'reviewers', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'kinder', 'fact', 'comparison', 'like', 'thrillers', 'dark', 'nihilistic', 'side', 'might', 'enjoy', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'original', 'means', 'watch', 'instead']",Get Carter VHS

Leaving Vegas for rainy Seattle, Carter is on a quest to find out who murdered his little brother and why. Along the way he tries to mend his broken relationships with his sister in law (Miranda Richardson) and his niece (Rachael Leigh Cook). He battles old enemies like Cyrus Pace (Mickey Rourke), an Internet porn purveyor and new ones like a shady club owner (original Carter Michael Caine), and a wimpy computer entrepreneur (Alan Cumming). I guess I never realized how terrible Stallone is. You can't understand a word he says and the man doesn't grasp subtlety. He lumbers around looking awkward during emotional scenes. Thankfully the supporting cast proves much more exciting. Caine, as always, is classy and fun and Cumming is too. The draw here is Mickey Rourke. This was before his comeback and before countless plastic surgeries that would leave his face ruined. He looks like the old Mickey here which is to say good. He's also kept in great shape and his final fight  with Carter is thrilling. All of the action is scored to pulsing techno music which livens things up considerably. The sexy women like Cook and Rhona Mitra, as the brother's mistress, are also very enjoyable. Unfortunately for Cook all her scenes are opposite Stallone and she is stuck trying to elicit some genuine emotion from him.  She does fine.

Directors are trivialized left and right--the good ones at least.  How else do we explain the lack of Academy Awards on Terrence Malick's belt after the Thin Red Line; people's degrading of John Woo movies as simply action, and not art; and, to pique my ire, the looking over of David Fincher in Fight Club?  Sure, Get Carter will never be a Gladiator or a Fight Club, something to inspire you and leave you disallusioned, but the directing is top-notch. If you enjoy angles and flashes, and the way these things can offer a greater insight into a character's development than simply the script, look no further than Stephen Kay.  At times, Carter is a gentler man.  In others we see violence through his eyes in flashes of anger.  Sure, the Die Hard's are great--they have the one-liners to make you laugh, and quote them when they're funny.  But there's nothing else there.  Characters do not evolve beyond introductions, and scripts offer no peace of mind.  I loved the Professional, even if it was a bit slow and thick at parts.  This movie excels where that one failed to coninue in excellence.  Carter is a truly interesting character, and Kay was smart enough to know that the movie should revolve around him--he is the subject and purpose of the movie.  And it works. Give this movie a chance--at 15.0$, how could you not?  If you like directing as an art, and as a corrolary to scripting, look here.  Don't look for action, though the car chases are the best since Ronin, or cheesy one-liners.

Though the look and sound is very stylish (the soundtrack is particularly interesting and original in a movie like this), sometimes the cuts and filmwork are rather jarring and draw too much attention to themselves. The entire movie almost looks like an MTV video, and yet it's hard to deny that all of this brings with it a definite atmosphere that works in spite of itself.Even though Stallone stars in &quot;Get Carter,&quot; I would not call it an action flick as much as a thriller. The action scenes are brief and relatively scarce, yet still intense when they roll around in the later stages. This puts more focus on the plotline, which is very rarely ever a bad thing. Still, the plot can sometimes be hard to follow, and by the end of the movie there remain a great deal of loose ends that were never tied up. In fact, you'll wonder if the vast majority of the bad guys were killed or just wounded, which is mostly a result of the film's artistic lisence. Sylvester's character, however, makes a charming hero you want to follow to the end. He may once not have been such a great guy, but there is certainly a strong moral fiber embedded within him, espesially where his family is concerned.When the credits rolled I realized that &quot;Get Carter&quot; is a unique film, sometimes confused, and yet ultimately entertaining, and fans of action-thrillers (and Stallone) should definitely give it a look.",4,STRANGE BUT ENJOYABLE,982195200,"02 15, 2001",2001,1549,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'originally', 'saw', 'film', 'even', 'half-way', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'really', 'liked', 'not', 'look', 'sound', 'very', 'stylish', 'soundtrack', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'original', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'cuts', 'filmwork', 'are', 'rather', 'jarring', 'draw', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'entire', 'movie', 'almost', 'MTV', 'video', 'yet', 'hard', 'deny', 'definite', 'atmosphere', 'spite', 'itself.Even', 'Stallone', 'stars', 'quot', 'Get', 'Carter', 'quot', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'action', 'flick', 'as', 'much', 'thriller', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'brief', 'relatively', 'scarce', 'yet', 'still', 'intense', 'when', 'roll', 'around', 'later', 'stages', 'more', 'focus', 'plotline', 'very', 'rarely', 'ever', 'bad', 'thing', 'Still', 'plot', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'hard', 'follow', 'end', 'movie', 'there', 'remain', 'great', 'deal', 'loose', 'ends', 'were', 'never', 'tied', 'up', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'vast', 'majority', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'killed', 'just', 'wounded', 'mostly', 'result', 'film', 'artistic', 'lisence', 'Sylvester', 'character', 'however', 'charming', 'hero', 'want', 'follow', 'end', 'may', 'once', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'guy', 'certainly', 'strong', 'moral', 'fiber', 'embedded', 'espesially', 'where', 'family', 'concerned.When', 'credits', 'rolled', 'realized', 'quot', 'Get', 'Carter', 'quot', 'unique', 'film', 'sometimes', 'confused', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'entertaining', 'fans', 'action-thrillers', 'Stallone', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'look']",Get Carter VHS

O'Blenis,"[16, 18]","Easily one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies (and best performances), this remake of ""Get Carter"" was relentlessly bashed upon its release but seems to be gaining more of a following in the subsequent years.  It's a good thing too, because if you pass this one up you're actually missing out on one of the most intense and just plain best action movies of the last several years.  Carter (Stallone) is basically a bad guy who doesn't want to be a bad guy, a midlevel mob enforcer who it seems gotten into his current lifestyle and occupation rather unwittingly some years ago and now can't find a way out.  It never says that in the movie, but that's what I got right from the beginning.  He seems resigned to his role until the death of his brother brings him home to his estranged family for the first time in years, where he becomes suspicious that his brother's death wasn't an accident.  When his sister-in-law and niece begin to be terrorized by some unknown assailants, Carter goes on the warpath against whoever's after them and whoever killed his brother, turning his violence loose without reserve.  The bond he forms with his niece (played by Rachel Leigh Cook in a big change of pace from her comedic roles) seems to galvanize his courage to not only pursue his current targets but to re-evaluate his whole life and the choices he's made and the position as a common thug he's lived in during recent years.  Very effective use of inner drama intermixes with tension and top-of-the-line fight scenes to make this a cut above many similar movies.  Was ripe for a sequel but it appears unlikely one will materialze.

There's also Doreen and Audrey of course, and Cyrus Paine, and Thorpey always hanging around...The movie contains an interesting Las Vegas scene too, and a long train scene.The end is really great: Jeremy was scared to death (really), but left alive (great for the story !!), while Brumby is catched and gets shots in the back.",5,An excellent Sylvester Stallone movie,1043366400,"01 24, 2003",2003,731,"['excellent', 'movie', 'even', 'pace', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'unfortunately', 'Well', 'least', 'get', 'what', 'need', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'few', 'psychological', 'hints', 'more', 'phrases', 'most', 'Sly', 'movies', 'fact', 'action', 'not', 'always', 'present', 'when', 'there', 'always', 'good', 'level', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'great', 'kind', 'main', 'character', 'Jack', 'also', 'Doreen', 'Audrey', 'course', 'Cyrus', 'Paine', 'Thorpey', 'always', 'hanging', 'movie', 'interesting', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'scene', 'too', 'long', 'train', 'scene.The', 'end', 'really', 'great', 'Jeremy', 'was', 'scared', 'death', 'really', 'left', 'alive', 'great', 'story', 'Brumby', 'catched', 'shots', 'back']",Get Carter VHS

In ""Get Carter,"" he plays Jack Carter, a bail bondsman of sorts and loves what he does. You don't pay the man, the stuff's in the fan. You don't like it, too bad. After his brother was murdered in Seattle, Carter went to check out the sneaky cover-up. He uncovered a pornographic solicitation scandal that involved his niece and he got extremely aggravated. Oh, piddily mortals, you shouldn't have messed with the best. A wannabe wiseguy played by Mickey Rourke, thought he could box with the immortal.

Remarkably, it still managed to bore, confuse, and altogether turn me off.For a basic plot summary, the movie focuses on Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone), who returns to Seattle (after spending years as a mob-enforcer in Vegas) for the funeral of his brother Richie.  After discovering that Richie was ""into something"" at the time of his death, and also may have involved his daughter Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook), Jack goes on a revenge streak that leads him into a dangerous business cover-up.This film fails on so many different levels that it is difficult to even remember them all (but I'll try):-The plot is so confusing that you almost have to ""Wiki"" the film after viewing to know exactly what transpired.-Besides Stallone's Carter, none of the auxiliary characters stand out whatsoever, thus they tend to blend into each other and only add to the confusion.-Director Stephen T. Kay tries to be a visionary with the camera, but all we get are scenes that don't make much sense, along with scenes so frenetic that it is impossible to even know what is going on.-Try as they might, the writers/producers cannot make Jack Carter an interesting character whatsoever.  For the majority of the film, he ruthlessly pursues a gang of business thugs, taking them down one by one.  Then, with hardly an emotional scene to swing public opinion, we are supposed to believe he has changed.  Not quite.Really, only Cook's Doreen is an interesting character in the film, and she isn't given enough screen time to upgrade the overall plot much, if at all.This ""Get Carter"" was a remake of the 1971 version starring Michael Caine, and I would recommend the original if only because there is no way it could be as boring, bland, or confusing as this 2000 reboot.",1,"More Like ""Get Confused""",1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,1858,"['sat', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'expected', 'very', 'little', 'based', 'previous', 'recommendations', 'reviews', 'Remarkably', 'still', 'managed', 'bore', 'confuse', 'altogether', 'turn', 'off.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Carter', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'who', 'Seattle', 'spending', 'years', 'mob-enforcer', 'Vegas', 'funeral', 'brother', 'Richie', 'discovering', 'Richie', 'was', 'something', 'time', 'death', 'also', 'may', 'have', 'involved', 'daughter', 'Doreen', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'Jack', 'revenge', 'streak', 'dangerous', 'business', 'cover-up.This', 'film', 'fails', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'difficult', 'even', 'remember', ""'ll"", 'try', '-The', 'plot', 'so', 'confusing', 'almost', 'have', 'Wiki', 'film', 'viewing', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'Stallone', 'Carter', 'none', 'auxiliary', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'whatsoever', 'thus', 'tend', 'blend', 'other', 'only', 'add', 'confusion.-Director', 'Stephen', 'T.', 'Kay', 'be', 'visionary', 'camera', 'get', 'are', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'scenes', 'so', 'frenetic', 'impossible', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'on.-Try', 'might', 'writers/producers', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'Jack', 'Carter', 'interesting', 'character', 'whatsoever', 'majority', 'film', 'ruthlessly', 'gang', 'business', 'thugs', 'taking', 'down', 'one', 'one', 'Then', 'hardly', 'emotional', 'scene', 'swing', 'public', 'opinion', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'changed', 'Not', 'quite.Really', 'only', 'Cook', 'Doreen', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'upgrade', 'overall', 'plot', 'much', 'all.This', 'Get', 'Carter', 'was', 'remake', '1971', 'version', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'would', 'recommend', 'original', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'boring', 'bland', 'confusing', '2000', 'reboot']",Get Carter VHS
