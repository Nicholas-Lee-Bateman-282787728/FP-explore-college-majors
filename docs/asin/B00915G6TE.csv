Says a lot about the writing of this show and the quality of the acting talent they continue to get.  ""Bad Girl"" Jules is a great diversion from the prim and proper Katherine now departed, and Ted Danson continues to impress as DB Russell.  Now....what would be great is some return visits from Katherine (as an FBI agent) and Grissom, maybe for a two-parter?  Katherine clashing with Jules would let the sparks fly big time.  It would also give the writers a chance to profile Grissom and Sara's explosive relationship a little further.  And, have another great actor (say, ""Fringe"" Alumi Anna Torv?) do a guest shot as another female serial killer? That would be great stuff! The best episodes in CSI's now 14 year run have always been where the principal characters come up against villans who are every bit the equal of the principals in intelligance, and are more than capable of defeating them! (the minature killer, the suicide killer ""Paul Milander"" from Seasons 1 & 2, etc.  the list goes on.

I want to see Ted Danson, Nick, Sara Sidle,the coroner, and even Elizabeth Shue. I don't care to see Hodgens or the other small guy in the lab and I don't want the blonde Morgan shoved down my throat. I like the main cast not the supporting. The story line of the lab guy getting engaged to the Italian bombshell is completely unbelievable. The guy looks like a weasel and was mainly a weasel in the past episodes/seasons.

1583574,A2ZFHK015YXP6U,B00915G6TE,Wild1138,"[0, 0]","I have been watching CSI for seven years. I will still consider it one of my favorite shows of all time. Some fans thought the show was going to go downhill in season 9 when William Peterson left, and surprisingly, it didn't. Laurence Fishburne made a surprisingly good lead, and some of my favorite episodes actually come from season 11 (which also had that awesome cameo from Peterson). So, what happened?Season 12 saw the departure of Fishburne, and Ted Danson came in as the new lead. I thought Danson was a good new addition to the cast, and I will say that season 12 was good, just not as good as season 11. My hope was that season 12 would be just like season 10; a good season, but the show was still trying to find it's footing. Season 10 was good, but it was still awkward without Peterson, and the writing wasn't all that top notch. Season 11, however, really stepped up it's game and did a terrific job utilizing Fishburne as it's lead. I hoped that season 13 would also step up it's game and take more advantage of it's new cast members.Unfortunately, None of the new or old characters are developed. If you didn't care for characters like Finn or Brody, this season doesn't help. They get more screen time, but they aren't developed and you still don't get much backstory from them (they're acting hasn't improved that much either). They come off as more annoying as ever. But, what really killed this season for me, was the episode &#34;Forget me not&#34;, which seriously jumped the shark. If you don't want to be spoiled, then stop reading this review.*SPOILERS!*Sara and Grisom are now divorced. Yep, nine years were spent developing this relationship. Now, it's meaningless. Imagine if &#34;Friends&#34; was renewed for an 11th season, and Rachael decided to go to Paris after all. Talk about a slap in the face to fans of those characters. This was the moment in CSI that they ran out of ideas for drama, and they decided &#34;hey, how about Sara gets divorced?&#34; BRILLIANT! One problem: She's married to one of the most beloved characters on the show, who isn't even here anymore. I know the human drama isn't the focus of the show but... oh wait, yes it is! What made this show stand out was it's characters, and why it's been around for all of these years. I know not every character is going to get a happy ending, but we invested nine years in the relationship of these characters. Splitting up Sara and Grisom made me consider everything post season 12 of CSI is non canon.Like I said, I know other fans will write this off and say &#34;eh, I just watch the show for the crime solving&#34;. But this season, the forensics side of it is pushed too far to the background. The mysteries this season are too predictable and too convoluted (even for CSI standards). The human drama that used to make this show so great is now the equivalent of a bad soap opera. If you're a fan of this show, I'd say just watch up to season 12, then the season 13 premiere, which works as a nice little finale. There really isn't anything worth watching after that. I wasn't one of the fans that gave up on this show after Peterson left. I'm glad I continued to watch, but now, it's time to stop. I'm not going to act like this season is terrible (there are a few mildly entertaining episodes here and there) but it's not the same CSI.",2,The season where things went wrong,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,3342,"['have', 'been', 'watching', 'CSI', 'seven', 'years', 'will', 'still', 'consider', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'time', 'fans', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'downhill', 'season', '9', 'when', 'William', 'Peterson', 'left', 'surprisingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'made', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'lead', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'actually', 'come', 'season', '11', 'also', 'had', 'awesome', 'cameo', 'Peterson', 'So', 'what', 'happened', 'Season', '12', 'saw', 'departure', 'Fishburne', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'came', 'new', 'lead', 'thought', 'Danson', 'was', 'good', 'new', 'addition', 'cast', 'will', 'say', 'season', '12', 'was', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'season', '11', 'hope', 'was', 'season', '12', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'season', '10', 'good', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'footing', 'Season', '10', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'still', 'awkward', 'Peterson', 'writing', 'was', ""n't"", 'top', 'notch', 'Season', '11', 'however', 'really', 'stepped', 'game', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'utilizing', 'Fishburne', 'lead', 'hoped', 'season', '13', 'would', 'also', 'step', 'up', 'game', 'take', 'more', 'advantage', 'new', 'cast', 'members.Unfortunately', 'None', 'new', 'old', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'Finn', 'Brody', 'season', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'are', ""n't"", 'developed', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'backstory', ""'re"", 'acting', ""n't"", 'improved', 'much', 'come', 'off', 'more', 'annoying', 'ever', 'what', 'really', 'killed', 'season', 'was', 'episode', '34', 'Forget', 'not', '34', 'seriously', 'jumped', 'shark', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spoiled', 'then', 'stop', 'reading', 'review.*SPOILERS', '*Sara', 'Grisom', 'are', 'now', 'divorced', 'Yep', 'nine', 'years', 'were', 'spent', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Now', 'meaningless', 'Imagine', '34', 'Friends', '34', 'was', 'renewed', '11th', 'season', 'Rachael', 'decided', 'go', 'Paris', 'Talk', 'slap', 'face', 'fans', 'characters', 'was', 'moment', 'CSI', 'ran', 'ideas', 'drama', 'decided', '34', 'hey', 'how', 'about', 'Sara', 'divorced', '34', 'BRILLIANT', 'One', 'problem', 'married', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'characters', 'show', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'here', 'anymore', 'know', 'human', 'drama', ""n't"", 'focus', 'show', 'oh', 'wait', 'yes', 'What', 'made', 'show', 'stand', 'out', 'was', 'characters', 'why', 'been', 'years', 'know', 'not', 'character', 'going', 'get', 'happy', 'ending', 'invested', 'nine', 'years', 'relationship', 'characters', 'Splitting', 'up', 'Sara', 'Grisom', 'made', 'consider', 'everything', 'post', 'season', '12', 'CSI', 'non', 'canon.Like', 'said', 'know', 'other', 'fans', 'will', 'write', 'off', 'say', '34', 'eh', 'just', 'watch', 'show', 'crime', 'solving', '34', 'season', 'forensics', 'side', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'background', 'mysteries', 'season', 'are', 'too', 'predictable', 'too', 'convoluted', 'even', 'CSI', 'standards', 'human', 'drama', 'used', 'make', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'now', 'equivalent', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', ""'d"", 'say', 'just', 'watch', 'up', 'season', '12', 'then', 'season', '13', 'premiere', 'nice', 'little', 'finale', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'fans', 'gave', 'up', 'show', 'Peterson', 'left', ""'m"", 'glad', 'continued', 'watch', 'now', 'time', 'stop', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'act', 'season', 'terrible', 'are', 'few', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'episodes', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'same', 'CSI']",CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Season 13
