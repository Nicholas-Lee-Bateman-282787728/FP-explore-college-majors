1343587,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B003FLQPX2,Brent Butler,"[4, 4]","Richard Boone was a thoughtful and serious actor, and so must have felt a great satisfaction in playing a 'thoughtful gunman' in the Old West.Although Paladin often professed the desire to settle every situation without gun play if possible, his rivals in most shows didn't afford him that opportunity. Its a rare show that Paladin didn't have to shoot someone ... sometimes a few someones.Despite many story corners having to be cut to fit these stories into a 30 minute format, each story is interesting and compelling, virtually always with a twist that keep them from being some of the many Western clich&eacute;s.Now that the series has been resurrected, generations who had no opportunity to appreciate this fine series in years past can now discover it for themselves. This is yet another example of how many television shows from the 50s and early 60s were far superior to most of what is filmed now.The 4th season has some delightful episodes ... very different and intriguing story lines for a Western. Paladin even helps Phileas Fogg along on his travels! Ken Curtis appears in what may have been an inspiration for his later role of Festus on Gun Smoke.If you have cable or satellite, you can also currently view this series on Encore Westerns.",5,The Thoughtful Western,1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,1256,"['Richard', 'Boone', 'was', 'thoughtful', 'serious', 'actor', 'so', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'great', 'satisfaction', 'playing', ""'thoughtful"", 'gunman', 'Old', 'West.Although', 'Paladin', 'often', 'professed', 'desire', 'settle', 'situation', 'gun', 'play', 'possible', 'rivals', 'most', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'afford', 'opportunity', 'rare', 'show', 'Paladin', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'shoot', 'someone', 'sometimes', 'few', 'someones.Despite', 'many', 'story', 'corners', 'having', 'be', 'cut', 'fit', 'stories', '30', 'minute', 'format', 'story', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'virtually', 'always', 'twist', 'keep', 'being', 'many', 'Western', 'clich', 'eacute', 'series', 'been', 'resurrected', 'generations', 'who', 'had', 'opportunity', 'appreciate', 'fine', 'series', 'years', 'can', 'now', 'discover', 'yet', 'example', 'how', 'many', 'television', 'shows', '50s', 'early', '60s', 'were', 'far', 'superior', 'most', 'what', 'filmed', 'now.The', '4th', 'season', 'delightful', 'episodes', 'very', 'different', 'intriguing', 'story', 'lines', 'Western', 'Paladin', 'even', 'Phileas', 'Fogg', 'travels', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'inspiration', 'later', 'role', 'Festus', 'Gun', 'Smoke.If', 'have', 'cable', 'satellite', 'can', 'also', 'currently', 'view', 'series', 'Encore', 'Westerns']",N/A

1343589,A2B24W9ZTLXOSR,B003FLQPX2,GL,"[3, 3]","I have purchased the first four seasons of the 50's TV Western, ""Have Gun Will Travel"" including Season 4, volume 2.  I must confess that while I started a bunch of episodes, I never really got past the first 10 minutes.  You know, black and white, ok but not great dvd presentations, obvious standard western sets, and what appeared to be, for the few minutes I watched, obvious plots.  Then, recently retired, with more time on my hands, I watched an episode from Season 4  (episode 8), ""The Shooting of Jessie Mae"".  I was relaxed, not rushed, and, this time, patient.  I was rewarded with the revelation that Richard Boone is a great actor, a story that developed into something that was anything but stereotypical, and  rich characterizations by  William Talman, Robert Blake, and Hari Rhodes.  Finally this 26 minute gem had a musical score by Bernard Herrman.  I have made it a habit to watch two or three episode each month now.  I have found myself continually amazed or, at least, engaged by the quality and maturity of the material and the acting.My conclusion is that it helps in your enjoyment of this series, and most television material from the 50's, if you try to forget the speed and tempo of life and entertainment today.  If you can afford to take the time sit back and watch these short stories with patience, I think you will be rewarded.  Have Gun Will Travel is an adult, powerful set of short dramas.

1343593,A2CWF1BN6OYWTK,B003FLQPX2,"Marivaux ""Ulriccowl""","[1, 1]","When I received the set I did notice that the picture quality appeared to be superior to the quality of the first 3 seasons that were released. The picture and audio are much crisper. And as far as I can tell, CBS did not mess with the original music, as they unfortunately have done with such a classic TV series as ""The Fugitive"". I was disappointed that they did not include the ""Wire Paladin"" feature that was a part of the first 3 seasons, which gave you background information on the episodes and the guest stars that appeared in a particular episode. I've also enjoyed the performance of Lisa Lu who plays Hey Girl in the 4th season.  Kam Tong (Hey Boy) had left to co-star in a show called ""Mr. Garland"" (later renamed ""The Garland Touch"").  After that show failed, he returned to HGWT.  While I did enjoy Tong's work, Lisa Lu really brought an interesting quality to what was essentially a ""servant role"".  She displays a subtle sense of humor and brings her own strong charisma to the scenes she plays with Richard Boone. I hope that if sales for this half season are not as spectacular as CBS hopes for, that they recognize their own role in possibly discouraging sales by the split season treatment. However, the acting work of Richard Boone in this series, the excellent writing that dealt progressively with many social issues within the context of a Western still deserves to be seen and enjoyed by the public. Those are some of the reasons that motivated my 5-star rating. I hope this series will continue to be released, so season 5 and 6 can finally be appreciated on DVD.",5,Have Gun Has Game,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,1590,"['When', 'received', 'set', 'did', 'notice', 'picture', 'quality', 'appeared', 'be', 'superior', 'quality', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'were', 'released', 'picture', 'audio', 'are', 'much', 'crisper', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'CBS', 'did', 'not', 'mess', 'original', 'music', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'done', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'Fugitive', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'Wire', 'Paladin', 'feature', 'was', 'part', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'gave', 'background', 'information', 'episodes', 'guest', 'appeared', 'particular', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'also', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'Lisa', 'Lu', 'who', 'Hey', 'Girl', '4th', 'season', 'Kam', 'Tong', 'Hey', 'Boy', 'had', 'left', 'co-star', 'show', 'called', 'Mr.', 'Garland', 'later', 'renamed', 'Garland', 'Touch', 'show', 'failed', 'returned', 'HGWT', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Tong', 'work', 'Lisa', 'Lu', 'really', 'brought', 'interesting', 'quality', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'servant', 'role', 'subtle', 'sense', 'humor', 'own', 'strong', 'charisma', 'scenes', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'hope', 'sales', 'half', 'season', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'spectacular', 'CBS', 'recognize', 'own', 'role', 'possibly', 'discouraging', 'sales', 'split', 'season', 'treatment', 'However', 'acting', 'work', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'series', 'excellent', 'writing', 'progressively', 'many', 'social', 'issues', 'context', 'Western', 'still', 'be', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'public', 'are', 'reasons', 'motivated', '5-star', 'rating', 'hope', 'series', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'released', 'season', '5', '6', 'can', 'finally', 'be', 'appreciated', 'DVD']",N/A

1343597,A1X7YF2QY6UYQO,B003FLQPX2,R. G. Bright,"[31, 34]","For anyone not aware, Season Four of HAVE GUN-WILL TRAVEL was the second best season of the series (following the superb Second Season). Frank Pierson was the producer, having recently replaced Sam Rolfe, the creator of the TV western. Rolfe came to blows with Richard Boone and conflict behind the camera led to Rolfe leaving the series and quitting on CBS. Pierson got along VERY well with Boone, allowing the actor to take control of the series (including directing a few episodes). Season Three was mildly weak as a result of Boone's insistence that each episode be filmed in two days instead of three, so he and actor Martin Gabel could play the starring leads in Norman Corwin's THE RIVALRY on Broadway. The season's filming had to conclude early in order for them to appear on schedule. With Season Four, there was no rush-job and each episode was made with care. In fact, at Boone's pleasure, the series became a text book example of how an actor can explore the character he played and you see a number of different sides of Paladin. ""Love's Young Dream"" is a sequel to a third-season episode, with a pre-Festus Ken Curtis as Monk, applying his real singing voice before the camera. ""Out at the Old Ballpark"" is perhaps the silliest episode of the series, but the fourth season brings to life some of the best episodes of the series such as ""A Head of Hair,"" ""Saturday Night,"" ""The Poker Fiend,"" ""The Marshal's Boy"" (which dealt with mental illness, tricky subject matter for the time), the series' only two-part episode ""A Quiet Night in Town"" which explores a darker side of Paladin and introduces us to Sydney Pollack as an actor before he became a director, ""The Princess and the Gunfighter"" which was clearly a rip-off of ROMAN HOLIDAY, ""El Paso Stage"" (with a crooked Buddy Ebsen), and my personal favorite, ""Broken Image."" (Keep in mind that a couple of these episodes were in the first half of the fourth season and appear in volume 1.)""The Shooting of Jessie May"" was the episode that brought William Talman back to Perry Mason. The actor was banned from the courtroom drama as a result of a drug charge, but after his appearance on this episode of HAVE GUN, CBS read the fan mail and reconsidered.""The Long Way Home,"" which will probably appear in the second volume of this season, will have my interest. When Columbia House initially released the entire series on 56 VHS videos many years ago, that was the only episode that suffered damage to the original studio archival negative. The damage was during the closing credits but some speculate the closing credits had a mistake and for legal reasons the studio could not include the complete cast. So the closing credits was computerized and not the original closing credits as it aired on TV. My hope is that when this episode appears on DVD, CBS will go back to the original master and not the altered print. No one wants to see an altered version of the closing credits. This will also verify whether CBS is turning to the studio masters for the DVD, or the same masters they used for the Columbia House VHS videos.This fourth season is a welcome addition to my collection. If anyone wants to know how I know so much about the series, please consult THE HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL COMPANION by Les Rayburn and Martin Grams. The book was not released by a major publishing house, course those companies have no interest in books like these. But it's not only a wealth of information, but gives behind-the-scenes stories and details for each episode. Sydney Pollack recalled how the scene where he smashes Boone's hand was done too real and the actor had to have his hand mended. Betsy-Jones Moreland recalled how she thought she was going to die as a result of the behind-the-scenes parties. Even the musicians recalled working on the series. Lots of stories and memories and recollections. The book is available on Amazon.com (that's where I got my copy) so I recommend you get both and enjoy the fourth season.",5,Kick Butt Review of the 4th Season,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,3978,"['anyone', 'not', 'aware', 'Season', 'Four', 'HAVE', 'GUN-WILL', 'TRAVEL', 'was', 'second', 'best', 'season', 'series', 'following', 'superb', 'Second', 'Season', 'Frank', 'Pierson', 'was', 'producer', 'having', 'recently', 'replaced', 'Sam', 'Rolfe', 'creator', 'TV', 'western', 'Rolfe', 'came', 'blows', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'conflict', 'camera', 'led', 'Rolfe', 'leaving', 'series', 'quitting', 'CBS', 'Pierson', 'got', 'along', 'VERY', 'well', 'Boone', 'allowing', 'actor', 'take', 'control', 'series', 'including', 'directing', 'few', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'mildly', 'weak', 'result', 'Boone', 'insistence', 'episode', 'be', 'filmed', 'two', 'days', 'instead', 'three', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Gabel', 'could', 'play', 'starring', 'leads', 'Norman', 'Corwin', 'THE', 'RIVALRY', 'Broadway', 'season', 'filming', 'had', 'conclude', 'early', 'order', 'appear', 'schedule', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'rush-job', 'episode', 'was', 'made', 'care', 'fact', 'Boone', 'pleasure', 'series', 'became', 'text', 'book', 'example', 'how', 'actor', 'can', 'explore', 'character', 'played', 'see', 'number', 'different', 'sides', 'Paladin', 'Love', 'Young', 'Dream', 'sequel', 'third-season', 'episode', 'pre-Festus', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'Monk', 'applying', 'real', 'singing', 'voice', 'camera', 'Old', 'Ballpark', 'perhaps', 'silliest', 'episode', 'series', 'fourth', 'season', 'brings', 'life', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'such', 'A', 'Head', 'Hair', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Poker', 'Fiend', 'Marshal', 'Boy', 'mental', 'illness', 'tricky', 'subject', 'matter', 'time', 'series', 'only', 'two-part', 'episode', 'A', 'Quiet', 'Night', 'Town', 'darker', 'side', 'Paladin', 'introduces', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'actor', 'became', 'director', 'Princess', 'Gunfighter', 'was', 'clearly', 'rip-off', 'ROMAN', 'HOLIDAY', 'El', 'Paso', 'Stage', 'crooked', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Broken', 'Image', 'Keep', 'mind', 'couple', 'episodes', 'were', 'first', 'half', 'fourth', 'season', 'appear', 'volume', '1', 'Shooting', 'Jessie', 'May', 'was', 'episode', 'brought', 'William', 'Talman', 'back', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'actor', 'was', 'banned', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'result', 'drug', 'charge', 'appearance', 'episode', 'HAVE', 'GUN', 'CBS', 'read', 'fan', 'mail', 'reconsidered', 'Long', 'Way', 'Home', 'will', 'probably', 'appear', 'second', 'volume', 'season', 'will', 'have', 'interest', 'When', 'Columbia', 'House', 'initially', 'released', 'entire', 'series', '56', 'VHS', 'videos', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'only', 'episode', 'suffered', 'damage', 'original', 'studio', 'archival', 'negative', 'damage', 'was', 'closing', 'credits', 'speculate', 'closing', 'credits', 'had', 'mistake', 'legal', 'reasons', 'studio', 'could', 'not', 'include', 'complete', 'cast', 'closing', 'credits', 'was', 'computerized', 'not', 'original', 'closing', 'credits', 'aired', 'TV', 'hope', 'when', 'episode', 'DVD', 'CBS', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'original', 'master', 'not', 'altered', 'print', 'one', 'see', 'altered', 'version', 'closing', 'credits', 'will', 'also', 'verify', 'CBS', 'turning', 'studio', 'masters', 'DVD', 'same', 'masters', 'used', 'Columbia', 'House', 'VHS', 'videos.This', 'fourth', 'season', 'welcome', 'addition', 'collection', 'anyone', 'know', 'how', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'series', 'please', 'consult', 'HAVE', 'GUN', 'WILL', 'TRAVEL', 'COMPANION', 'Les', 'Rayburn', 'Martin', 'Grams', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'major', 'publishing', 'house', 'course', 'companies', 'have', 'interest', 'books', 'not', 'only', 'wealth', 'information', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stories', 'details', 'episode', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'recalled', 'how', 'scene', 'where', 'Boone', 'hand', 'was', 'done', 'too', 'real', 'actor', 'had', 'have', 'hand', 'mended', 'Betsy-Jones', 'Moreland', 'recalled', 'how', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'result', 'behind-the-scenes', 'parties', 'Even', 'musicians', 'recalled', 'working', 'series', 'Lots', 'stories', 'memories', 'recollections', 'book', 'available', 'Amazon.com', 'where', 'got', 'copy', 'so', 'recommend', 'get', 'enjoy', 'fourth', 'season']",N/A
