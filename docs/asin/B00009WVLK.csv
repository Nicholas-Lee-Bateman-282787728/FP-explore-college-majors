A fun series if you're a Marvel or X-Men fan.,4,Well done.,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,125,"['think', 'high', 'point', 'season', 'one', 'next', 'volume', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'fun', 'series', ""'re"", 'Marvel', 'X-Men', 'fan']",N/A

I felt it was very helpful and taught many valuable lessons such as team work, friendship, and doing what you think is right even if no one else agrees with you.  This disc includes the episodes 'Turn of the Rogue,' 'SpykeCam,' and 'Survival of the Fittest.'  I would suggest the entire series to anyone including people who aren't necessarily fans of X-men.",5,X-Men Revival,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,444,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'even', 'have', 'heard', 'referred', 'juvenille', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'helpful', 'taught', 'many', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'such', 'team', 'work', 'friendship', 'doing', 'what', 'think', 'right', 'even', 'one', 'else', 'disc', 'episodes', ""'Turn"", 'Rogue', ""'SpykeCam"", ""'Survival"", 'Fittest', 'would', 'suggest', 'entire', 'series', 'anyone', 'including', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'fans', 'X-men']",N/A
758907,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00009WVLK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","""X Marks the Spot"" offers up episodes 7-9 of the first season of the animated series ""X-Men Evolution"" that airs on the Kids! WB network.  The series, focuses on the core group of Professor X, Cyclops, Jean Gray, and, of course, Wolverine: (7) ""Turn of the Rogue"" (Aired February 3, 2001) is the episode where Rogue discovers the truth about Principal Darkholme on a Geology Club field trip to some underground caves and finally decides to turn her back on Mystique and throw in her lot with the X-Men; (8) ""Spykecam"" (Aired February 10, 2001), has Spyke working on a school assignment to document teenage life using his digicam, just as Sabertooth attacks the Institute looking for his old friend Wolverine; and (9) ""Survival of the Fittest"" (Aired March 3, 2001), starts with the X-Men attending a survival school and ends with Mystique releasing the Juggernaut from prison to go after his brother, Professor X.  The situation is so bad that the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants have to join forces to take down the Juggernaut.  This is the third of four vidoes covering the first season of ""X-Men Evolution,"" which covers a lot of ground in getting all the merry mutants together.  All three of these episodes are above average in terms of this particular series.  Interestingly the show manages to put off the first confrontation with Magneto until the final pair of episodes, to be found on the next tape.",4,Rouge joins up and Sabertooth and Juggernaut come calling,1068422400,"11 10, 2003",2003,1419,"['X', 'Spot', 'up', 'episodes', '7-9', 'first', 'season', 'animated', 'series', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'Kids', 'WB', 'network', 'series', 'core', 'group', 'Professor', 'X', 'Cyclops', 'Jean', 'Gray', 'course', 'Wolverine', '7', 'Turn', 'Rogue', 'Aired', 'February', '3', '2001', 'episode', 'where', 'Rogue', 'truth', 'Principal', 'Darkholme', 'Geology', 'Club', 'field', 'trip', 'underground', 'caves', 'finally', 'decides', 'turn', 'back', 'Mystique', 'throw', 'lot', 'X-Men', '8', 'Spykecam', 'Aired', 'February', '10', '2001', 'Spyke', 'working', 'school', 'assignment', 'document', 'teenage', 'life', 'using', 'digicam', 'just', 'Sabertooth', 'Institute', 'looking', 'old', 'friend', 'Wolverine', '9', 'Survival', 'Fittest', 'Aired', 'March', '3', '2001', 'X-Men', 'attending', 'survival', 'school', 'Mystique', 'releasing', 'Juggernaut', 'prison', 'go', 'brother', 'Professor', 'X', 'situation', 'so', 'bad', 'X-Men', 'Brotherhood', 'Evil', 'Mutants', 'have', 'join', 'forces', 'take', 'down', 'Juggernaut', 'third', 'four', 'vidoes', 'covering', 'first', 'season', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'lot', 'ground', 'getting', 'merry', 'together', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'terms', 'particular', 'series', 'show', 'put', 'off', 'first', 'confrontation', 'Magneto', 'final', 'pair', 'episodes', 'be', 'found', 'next', 'tape']",N/A
