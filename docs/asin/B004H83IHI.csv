First up is the Early Years, a great prequel film from 86 written by series creator David Jacobs.  It is interesting in it's way, although not entirely in sync with the show.  Next is JR Returns, the first reunion sequel.  This is a great film, providing an excellent resolution to the series with a great sense of continuity and finality.  It was written by Dallas masters Leonard Katzman and Art Lewis and directed by Katzman, who died shortly before it's release.  As the main man behind all of Dallas except the dream, it is a fitting tribute to him and Swan Song to his show which he ran and crafted for so long.  The next one, War of the Ewings, is not as good, having a new writer come on and in general being extraneous.  Finally, the silly 04 reunion which was already on another season release is also going to be here.  It's just the cast hanging around as themselves and frankly doesn't do much for me.

Since Then I've Purchased Seasons 4-7, With Having Just Purchased 5-7 This Morning. I Noticed That Someone Suggested That The Entire Series Should Be Viewed Before Viewing The Movies.

1408123,A28B7IJR80M8KE,B004H83IHI,"Michael Pettinato ""mike2922""","[1, 1]","Having watched all 14 seasons & the new TNT reboot of ""Dallas"", I have to say that this is a beginning & end to the original series, ""The Early Years"" gives us Dale Midkiff as a young Jock Ewing & Molly Hagan as a young Miss Elle, Hagan definately has the face of what Miss Elle might have looked like in her youth, the actor that plays the younger Digger Barnes definately favors Ken Kercheval who played Cliff Barnes, they definately picked the right actors to portray these beloved characters in their youth, we also meet Jock Ewing's brother Jason who's children we met in season 8 & 9 that was played by Jennilee Harrison & Dack Rambo, when Jock, Jason, & Digger do hit oil they deal with all kinds of corruption from the local towns people as they try to strike oil in the depression era Texas of the 1930's, we see what led to Jock & Jason's falling out as it was talked about in season 8, we also see what brought about Jock & Digger's feud that would carry on with their children J.R. & Cliff in the series, this is a great prequel film & should be watched before the series to newcomers who watch for the first time, my only complaint on this one is Jock & Elle's courtship is a bit rushed, but other than that, a good set-up to the series, the second film ""J.R. Returns"" picks up where season 14 ended, with J.R. once again having lost everthing at the end of the series trying to get Ewing Oil back, what I liked about this one is that it really sets-up the new series now airing on TNT, with a teenage John Ross & Christopher & Cliff's teenage daughter, who are in their 30's with the new show & Bobby's new girlfriend who looks like a younger version of Brenda Strong who is Bobby's new wife on the current TNT reboot, which brings me to the last made-for-T.V.-movie ""War of the Ewings"" which totally contradicts the show, whoever wrote this one wasn't a true fan or even a good writer, where do I start, this one totally ignores the events in ""J.R. Returns"", there is no John Ross, Christopher, Cliff Barnes, all are MIA, it is as if they never existed,  Bobby's new girlfriend is never mentioned, there is an implied romance betwwen Bobby & Sue Ellen(dumb) an assassination attempt on J.R. that makes no sense, he hasn't done anything at this point to warrant such an attempt, this was said to be a ratings disappointment & I can see why, why Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, & Larry Hagman agreed to this script is a mystery, for new fans I say watch the Prequel film ""Early Years"", the 14 seasons, then ""J.R. Returns"" & go directly to the new TNT rebooted ""Dallas"", but skip ""War of the Ewings"" at all costs.",4,"""The Early Years & J.R.

On this two-disc set viewers get the three films including the prequel that aired on CBS in 1986 while the series was still airing called ""The Early Years"" which shows the beginnings of Southfork and how the Ewing/Barnes feud began. The last two movies aired after the serial went off the aired and the first ""J.R. Returns"" aired in 1996 and was quite a ratings bonanza. It featured Larry Hagman , Patrick Duffy and Linda Grey reprising their roles and showed the stronger side of Sue Ellen who was no longer an alcoholic, but a very demanding and conniving business woman. The final film ""The War of the Ewings"" was not at all well-written mainly because the powers-that-be who helmed the first ""Dallas"" sequel were not on board, and ultimately it was a ratings failure.

For example it's great to see vintoria complaining to patrick about their divorce and patrick's involvement with the beautiful priscilla presley and now u can cry and weep about how great were romeo and juliet in the show but for me patrick and priscilla had a great erotic chemistry which is impossible to understand unless u watch the entire 6th dvd show to see it for yourself.Anyways this is a great but not complete set cause recently another reunion was releaseed and u can order this gem from the official dallas website.I Think this new reunion is from 2008 or so. the previous 2004 reunion is also available in the season 4 dvd set.,5,Now we can complete our dallas collection ? well...almost,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,1145,"['will', 'disagree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'i', 'will', 'say', 'right', 'thing', 'begin', 'EARLY', 'YEARS', 'then', 'go', 'entire', '14', 'seasons', 'go', 'two', 're-union', 'films', 'right', 'order.Anyways', 'great', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'completed', 'tv', 'movies', 'also', 'great', 'have', '2004', 'reunion', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'see', 'old', 'gang', 'together', 'again', 'house', 'lived', 'nearly', '15', 'years', 'so', 'talking', 'remembering', 'past', 'example', 'great', 'see', 'vintoria', 'complaining', 'patrick', 'divorce', 'patrick', 'involvement', 'beautiful', 'priscilla', 'presley', 'now', 'u', 'can', 'cry', 'weep', 'how', 'great', 'were', 'romeo', 'juliet', 'show', 'patrick', 'priscilla', 'had', 'great', 'erotic', 'chemistry', 'impossible', 'understand', 'u', 'watch', 'entire', '6th', 'dvd', 'show', 'see', 'yourself.Anyways', 'great', 'not', 'complete', 'set', 'cause', 'recently', 'reunion', 'was', 'releaseed', 'u', 'can', 'order', 'gem', 'official', 'dallas', 'website.I', 'Think', 'new', 'reunion', '2008', 'so', 'previous', '2004', 'reunion', 'also', 'available', 'season', '4', 'dvd', 'set']",N/A
