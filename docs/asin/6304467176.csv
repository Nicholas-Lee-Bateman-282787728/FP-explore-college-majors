424370,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6304467176,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Let me start by saying I came to this documentary knowing next to nothing about Tupac Shakur, his music, or hip hop/gangsta culture.  I don't think I ever even heard of Tupac until the rumors started about how he faked his death, etc.  Thus, it should come as no surprise that I found Thug Immortal a pretty informative documentary.  I'm not sure it really captured the essence of the man, however, so I'm still on the fence as to whether the positives of his life outweigh the negatives.  A diverse range of his friends and associates talk about the man behind the thug persona, but the facts of his life make it a little hard to buy into some of what they are saying.This isn't a biopic, as the vast majority of the material consists of interviews with those who knew Tupac from his early days in San Marin to his final days with Death Row records leading up to his murder.  As far as his childhood is concerned, all we really learn is that his mother was a major player with the Black Panthers.  The story here really starts after his move from Baltimore to California as a teen.  That's where his pursuit of a rap career really started, and I greatly enjoyed the interviews with those who knew him and rapped with him then.  Of course, most of those stories couldn't be farther away from role model material, but it's hard not to laugh with these guys about the crazy stuff that went down back then.  The most surprising thing to me was the fact that Tupac, while never one to back down from a fight, seemed to get beaten up a lot.  It's here in these formative years, though, that we see the idealistic Tupac who wants his rap to mean something and to help change for the better some of the aspects of life as he has lived it.  It is not until his portrayal of Deacon in the filmJuicethat he turns more to the hard core rap and lifestyle he is best remembered for today, and several of his friends express some sadness about this change in his life, arguing that it wasn't the real Tupac.Apart from Shock G, I had never heard of any of the rappers interviewed for this documentary, so I'm not sure how prominent any of them may have been (my knowledge of rap does not go very far beyond old school artists like Run DMC and Whodini), but the words of Death Row head honcho Suge Knight, who was almost killed himself when Tupac was gunned down, certainly leave a few lasting impressions.  For me, though, the greatest insights into the life and legacy of Tupac come from some of the journalists and writers who interviewed him, such as Malcolm Hoover of 4080 Magazine and editor Tony Patrick, who seemed to sum Tupac's life up with the following words: ""age without maturity, knowledge without wisdom, ... order turned into chaos.""In the end, though, I don't feel as if I know very much about Tupac yet.  The limited video of the man himself included here (much of it from home movies) do not show the intellectual artist that many of his associates describe.  I certainly know little more about his music, as that is in no way a focus of this documentary.  As for his death, you'll find no conspiracy theories here, just the sad reflections of a life of great potential cut short by unknown assailants.",4,"Interesting and informative, but it doesn't get to the essence of the man",1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,3206,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'came', 'documentary', 'knowing', 'next', 'nothing', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'music', 'hip', 'hop/gangsta', 'culture', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'even', 'heard', 'Tupac', 'rumors', 'started', 'how', 'faked', 'death', 'etc', 'Thus', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'found', 'Thug', 'Immortal', 'pretty', 'informative', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'captured', 'essence', 'man', 'however', ""'m"", 'still', 'fence', 'positives', 'life', 'outweigh', 'negatives', 'diverse', 'range', 'friends', 'associates', 'talk', 'man', 'thug', 'persona', 'facts', 'life', 'make', 'little', 'hard', 'buy', 'what', 'are', 'saying.This', ""n't"", 'biopic', 'vast', 'majority', 'material', 'interviews', 'who', 'knew', 'Tupac', 'early', 'days', 'San', 'Marin', 'final', 'days', 'Death', 'Row', 'records', 'leading', 'up', 'murder', 'As', 'far', 'childhood', 'concerned', 'really', 'learn', 'mother', 'was', 'major', 'player', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'story', 'here', 'really', 'move', 'Baltimore', 'California', 'teen', 'where', 'pursuit', 'rap', 'career', 'really', 'started', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'interviews', 'who', 'knew', 'rapped', 'then', 'course', 'most', 'stories', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'farther', 'away', 'role', 'model', 'material', 'hard', 'not', 'laugh', 'guys', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'went', 'down', 'back', 'then', 'most', 'surprising', 'thing', 'was', 'fact', 'Tupac', 'never', 'one', 'back', 'down', 'fight', 'seemed', 'get', 'beaten', 'up', 'lot', 'here', 'formative', 'years', 'though', 'see', 'idealistic', 'Tupac', 'who', 'rap', 'mean', 'something', 'help', 'change', 'better', 'aspects', 'life', 'lived', 'not', 'portrayal', 'Deacon', 'filmJuicethat', 'more', 'hard', 'core', 'rap', 'lifestyle', 'best', 'remembered', 'today', 'several', 'friends', 'express', 'sadness', 'change', 'life', 'arguing', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'Tupac.Apart', 'Shock', 'G', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'rappers', 'interviewed', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'prominent', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'knowledge', 'rap', 'not', 'go', 'very', 'far', 'old', 'school', 'artists', 'Run', 'DMC', 'Whodini', 'words', 'Death', 'Row', 'head', 'honcho', 'Suge', 'Knight', 'who', 'was', 'almost', 'killed', 'when', 'Tupac', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'certainly', 'leave', 'few', 'lasting', 'impressions', 'though', 'greatest', 'insights', 'life', 'legacy', 'Tupac', 'come', 'journalists', 'writers', 'who', 'interviewed', 'such', 'Malcolm', 'Hoover', '4080', 'Magazine', 'editor', 'Tony', 'Patrick', 'who', 'seemed', 'sum', 'Tupac', 'life', 'up', 'following', 'words', 'age', 'maturity', 'knowledge', 'wisdom', 'order', 'turned', 'chaos', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'know', 'very', 'much', 'Tupac', 'yet', 'limited', 'video', 'man', 'included', 'here', 'much', 'home', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'intellectual', 'artist', 'many', 'associates', 'describe', 'certainly', 'know', 'little', 'more', 'music', 'way', 'focus', 'documentary', 'death', ""'ll"", 'find', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'here', 'just', 'sad', 'reflections', 'life', 'great', 'potential', 'cut', 'short', 'unknown', 'assailants']",N/A

Its basically just no-thrills video footage of some old friends of Pacs from Baltimore, hanging around their neighborhood talking about Pac, some of their memories are funny and its amusing watching them clown around telling their stories, but most of it is entirely forgettable. Theres a few home made video segments that Pac and his boys took of each other back in the day, but nothing too great. If youre a crazy Pac fan that must own everything with his name attached to it, then go ahead and buy this Video/DVD.  But, if youre just a big fan of Pacs who wants to pick up a video/DVD about him, I recommend the Tupac Movie documentary ""Tupac/Resurrection"" which is really a must own for any real 2Pac fan.  Also although not all about just Tupac himself ""welcome to Death Row"" is interesting to watch, but do yourself a favor and save your money rather then spend it on this video/DVD. Trust me people, this video/DVD sucks, dont believe any of the reviews that said it was great or whatever.

424375,AL6JIT43D8D4Z,6304467176,"unraveler ""unraveler""","[15, 16]","I liked this documentary, even if it gets a bit slow at times. It tells of Tupac's hard life as a child and adolescent. He was born in New York, but the family moved around a lot, ending up in Marine county in northern California. Tupac's mother was a former Black Panther, released from prison just before giving birth to Tupac. As everybody knows, Tupac's first name is due to Leftist Tupac Amaru guerilla's fighting in Peru.The people interviewed, with the exception of Suge Knight, are not nationally known, but there was not much one could do about it, if one wanted a thorough documentary about Tupac's life as a young adult in northern Cali. He did not hobnob with a lot of nationally known people, so you are left with interviewing those who actually knew him.I enjoyed the documentary, especially those moments (unfortunately they were rather rare) that showed the footage of Tupac. Suge Knight gave a very good interview, and I suppose that the price of having him in this film was that neither ""Bloods,"" nor ""MOB Pirus"" are mentioned. But there is a reference to Orlando Anderson as a ""notorious Crip"" and the footage of what happened in Las Vegas following the Tyson fight, when Tupac and his friends apparently assaulted Anderson, who it is said, refused to press charges when approached by the police.Finally, there is a story of the shooting of Tupac and his death in the hospital.The video lacks a flashy production, and the camera work may be less than outstanding at times, but it does give you an insight into Tupac's origins and character. There are many ironies in life. In this case, a New Yorker was transplanted to northern California, ended up in prison, was bailed out, and came to represent southern California gangsta culture. There are two classes of people who occasionally grow to lofty heights in a foreign soil--great tyrants and great artists.
