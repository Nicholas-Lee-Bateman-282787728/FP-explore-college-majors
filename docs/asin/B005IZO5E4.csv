It's an absolutely amazing aircraft. It's too bad only the military can build stuff like this and such a great plane was scrapped. It may have been simply the lack of existing footage of the craft, but I was disappointed we didn't see even more of it's flight capabilities.",4,Very Cool Technology,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,367,"['knew', 'YF-23', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'been', 'direct', 'competition', 'YF-22', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'aircraft', 'too', 'bad', 'only', 'military', 'can', 'build', 'stuff', 'such', 'great', 'plane', 'was', 'scrapped', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'lack', 'existing', 'footage', 'craft', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'even', 'more', 'flight', 'capabilities']",Web of Secrecy:YF-23 Black Widow II Declassified
1462853,A3A5VHIOCJIDDP,B005IZO5E4,Gary V,"[7, 7]","A decent review of the ATF and the work that the people at Northrop put into their entry, the YF-23.  Although I have had a life long interest in aviation, I am not well versed on the YF-23, which is probably due to some degree to the fact that there is still secrecy surrounding parts of the ATF program.  This documentary likewise did not seem to reveal anything particularly detailed technically.  It spends a fair amount of time on the larger ATF program, and then on the Northrop people involved with the YF-23 and their dedication to the project.  The video and images, though, of the YF-23 in flight were very nice to see.  For my taste, it would have been better if there were another half hour or so of material to explore more details about the aircraft.",3,A decent documentary.,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,764,"['decent', 'review', 'ATF', 'work', 'people', 'Northrop', 'put', 'entry', 'YF-23', 'have', 'had', 'life', 'long', 'interest', 'aviation', 'am', 'not', 'well', 'versed', 'YF-23', 'probably', 'due', 'degree', 'fact', 'still', 'secrecy', 'surrounding', 'parts', 'ATF', 'program', 'documentary', 'likewise', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'reveal', 'anything', 'particularly', 'detailed', 'technically', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'larger', 'ATF', 'program', 'then', 'Northrop', 'people', 'involved', 'YF-23', 'dedication', 'project', 'video', 'images', 'YF-23', 'flight', 'were', 'very', 'nice', 'see', 'taste', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'were', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'material', 'explore', 'more', 'details', 'aircraft']",Web of Secrecy:YF-23 Black Widow II Declassified
1462854,A1J48DYGTWSPHS,B005IZO5E4,inspectorudy,"[0, 3]",This is a documentary on the contest between two companies vying for the right to manufacture the next generation of advanced fighter aircraft for the US and its allies. Unfortunately it is primarily about the F-23 and does not include much of the winner the F-22. It is also about the people who worked on the plane and not very much about the plane itself. There is no head to head comparisons of the two planes and what is revealed is five of six years old. Not much to see or learn from this turkey.,2,Old news,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,503,"['documentary', 'contest', 'two', 'companies', 'vying', 'right', 'manufacture', 'next', 'generation', 'advanced', 'fighter', 'aircraft', 'US', 'allies', 'primarily', 'F-23', 'not', 'include', 'much', 'winner', 'F-22', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'plane', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'plane', 'head', 'head', 'comparisons', 'two', 'planes', 'what', 'revealed', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'Not', 'much', 'see', 'learn', 'turkey']",Web of Secrecy:YF-23 Black Widow II Declassified
