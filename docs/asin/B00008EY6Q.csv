Thanks to Comedy Central and recurrent bouts of insomnia I have not been without The Critic these many long years, but not a day went by where I didn't curse those responsible for the show's demise.  How could a show with so many writers, producers, and actors from The Simpsons last only two seasons....IDIOT executives, that's how.Voice Talents:Jon Lovitz as Jay ShermanNancy Cartwright as MargoGerrit Graham as FranklinDoris Grau as DorisJudith Ivery as EleanorCharles Napier as Duke PhillipsNick Jameson as Vlada Velimirovic, othersMaurice LeMarche as Jeremy Hawke, othersChristine Cavanaugh as Martin(1) The Pilot (1994):  Guest star Valerie Fox as an actress who seduces Jay in order to secure a good review for her latest (sub-par) performance.  (4 of 5)(2) Marty's First Date:  It's career day at Marty's school (Jay's son) where Jay is embarrassed and Marty meets the girl who is to be his first date.  (5)(3) Dial `M' for Mother:  Test audiences find Jay cold, uncaring, and homely and less warm and cuddly than Hitler.  He goes on Geraldo with his mother in order to soften his image-with disastrously hilarious results.  (5)(4) Miserable:  An obsessed projectionist kidnaps Jay so that he can tell her what movies are good.  On the plus side, Jay did get some action.  Jay is rescued by Jeremy Hawke, his best bud and Australian action hero.  (4)(5) A Little Deb Will Do You:  Margo (Jay's sister) is reluctant to attend a debutante ball despite pressure from her mother (...to starve yourself to fit into a dress, to dance with boys who feel you up, to drink so much you fall into a well, it's a magical night...).  Secondary to threats to shoot her beloved horse, Margo agrees to her mother's will and has a miserable time.  (5)(6) Eyes on the Prize:  Jay celebrates his 1000th episode but poor ratings and no visitor turn-out at his party spur him to quit and focus on winning a Pulitzer.  Guest stars Phil Hartman as Adolph Hitmaker, Adam West as himself, and Tress MacNeille make the episode a hit.  (4)(7) Every Doris Has Her Day:  Jay and Doris (yep, Lunch lady Doris) go to a show and as they get to know each other better, it becomes apparent that Jay may in fact be Doris' child given up for adoption years earlier.  (4)(8) Marathon Mensch:  To prove his machismo, Jay agrees to train for and run the NY Marathon.  Guest star Bob Costas.  (4)(9) L.A. Jay:  Jay writes a screenplay and takes it to LA  but it's too good for the illiterate , ex-gigolo executive to produce (instead opting for Revenge of the Nerds 4).  Jay is then hired to write `Ghost-Chasers III' and in so doing must abandon his creative ideology.  (5)(10) Dr. Jay:  As Duke announces his plan to change the endings of Holly Woods greatest hits he is stricken with a terminal illness.  Jay vows to find a cure.  (4)(11) A Day at the Races and a Night at the Opera:  Jay is voted Time Magazine's Wittiest Man Alive and to improve ratings Duke offers to pay any viewer $100 if they don't find Jay funny.  Upon failing, Duke and Jay are taken to court in a mass class-action suit.  Guest stars Steve Allen and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  (5)(12) Uneasy Rider:  Jay refuses to endorse products on his show and quits his job to become a truck driver.  In order to impress his fellow truckers he volunteers for the high-risk jobs.  (4)(13) A Pig-Boy and His Dog:  Jay's mother writes a children's book whose main character (pig-boy) resembles the critic and he is tortured by the consequences.  (5)(14) Sherman, Woman, and Child (1995):  Here we are introduced to Alice, Jay's assistant and on-again off-again love interest.  Alice re-creates Jay's image thereby saving his job and Jay teachers her how to survive in NYC.  (4)(15) Siskel and Ebert & Jay and Alice:  This episode guest stars Roger Ebert, Gene Siskel, Rex Reed, and Gene Shalit.  Siskel and Ebert splt and each want Jay as their new partner.  (4)(16) Lady Hawke:  Jay falls for Jeremy's twin sister, Olivia.  Olivia is a man-eater and Jeremy fights to protect his friend.  Meanwhile, Alice finds herself caught in this love triangle.  (4)(17) A Song for Margo:  Margo falls for her dangerous new neighbor, Johhny Wrath from the group Nuns in a Blender.  When she denies his advances, he abandons her for another, looser woman.  (4)(18) From Chunk to Hunk:  Jay and Marty go to a fat camp for diet, exercise, and torture.  Marty is successful both in losing weight and subsequently with the ladies.  (4)(19) All the Duke's Men:  Jay is enlisted as a speech writer for Duke Phillips' presidential campaign.  Jay's writing gains him respect and Duke the loyalty of the masses.  When Jay refuses to write a speech where Duke drops Franklin (Jay's father) as his running mate Duke fires him and reveals his true plans for the country.  (5)(20) Sherman of Arabia:  Marty has a slumber party and Jay regales the children with his story of capture and subsequent heroism during the Gulf War.  (4)(21) Frankie and Ellie Get Lost:  Following their 40th anniversary, Jay's parents get lost at sea when their penguin-piloted aircraft crashes.  Recall that ""penguins can't fly.""  (5)(22) Dukerella:  Miranda, Alice's sister (Alice is Jay's girlfriend), visits NY and proceeds to irritate all with her great beauty, naivety, and deep southern ways.  Just as Miranda hit's rock-bottom she meets and falls in love with Duke.  (5)(23) I Can't Believe It's a Clip Show:  Jay and pals are held hostage at his 10th anniversary show.  Although this is a flash-back episode and no way for a show like the Critic to leave us, it did have Milton Berle as the saves-the-day ninja.

Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 5]","Like most Simpsons watching fanatics that are also latched tightly to the Family Guy, I couldn't help but walk (never run) to buy this series when it came out.  Jay Sherman is my inspiration for my excessive amounts of film reviews.  He was never afraid to speak his mind about the garbage distributed by Hollywood ever week.  His classic line, ""It stinks"" inspired me to find those horrible films and make sure I warned others before it was too late.  He is a God among Gods in my book!Created by the same team that did The Simpsons, Sherman great to life through not only the witty banter that leapt from his mouth, but also his surrounding characters.  Parodying some of cinema's finest, you cannot help but laugh at this obese critic that wants nothing more than to have respect and eat his Charleston Chew.  Duke Phillips is one of the funniest characters created and provides some of the funniest social commentary on the extremely wealthy in our country.  Sherman, in my eyes, represents the little man.  While making $270,000 a year, he doesn't rise above anyone else.  He reminds all of us of who we are, whether it would be running a marathon or trying to clean-up his hometown of New York, Sherman represents our desires and wants.  One of our biggest desires is to see good cinema.  We pay top dollar to see good movies, why does Hollywood continually fill our plate with all the bread we can eat before giving us the main course?  Suddenly, we are too full to enjoy it.I would like to applaud Jay Sherman for his fight against a repetitive and uncreative Hollywood.  As an avid filmgoer it is nice to see the battle being fought in the animated world.  Sadly, I only wish this series could have lasted long enough to endure some of the garbage released today.  We need a new Jay Sherman to help us wade through and poke fun of today's Hollywood.I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone that is as upset with Hollywood as I.  This series will make you laugh at a large man that loves food and life.

While this show doesn't ""stink"" I thought it was fairly hit or miss much of the time, with many of the episodes having a similar theme to them. Jay wasn't even the funniest person on the show IMHO. However, while the Critic wasn't the most short-lived show in history it's still too bad it had an uphill battle pretty much the whole time it was on the air. Since many who worked on the show also worked on the Simpsons I personally think it would've been nice if Jay were to become a re-occurring character there, such as at least once a season like Sideshow Bob. He was already a known character there so writing him in, claiming he was kicked out of NY or something, would be simple to pull off. If not the Simpsons than perhaps the other Matt Groening show, Futurama.

Jean's response, basically, is ""Look how far it went.""Not as far as it deserved, sadly, and ""The Critic"" feels like a creature of its time.  Satires of films like ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Scent of a Woman"" were a lot funnier when the movies were fresh in people's heads.  Still, ""The Critic"" had one-liners only ""The Simpsons"" could rival, from Jay's ""And that's why I'm glad the Beatles broke up"" to Franklin's should-have-been-classic ""As the first black female head of the Ku Klux Klan, I'd like to say America stinks!""No surprise, then, that this was the first prime time cartoon that could hold its own with and frequently surpass Homer and the gang (if you remember ""Capital Critters,"" you'll see my point).  I personally prefer the Fox episodes, which rub down some of Jay's harsher edges (Alice is a big help) and go into loonier directions than the ABC episodes, but each show has achingly funny moments, whether it's Orson Welles narrating a video will or a ""Have A Nice Day"" poster calling Jay ""a scum-sucking loser.""Unlike ""The Simpsons,"" though, ""The Critic"" often targeted specific fads or celebrities, which are funny as long as those targets are in the public mind. A scene of Roseanne terrorizing New York was a lot funnier when, well, Roseanne was, and some of the Clinton jokes are already frayed around the edges.  If ""The Critic"" had survived longer, as it should have, these things might have been less noticeable, but with only 23 episodes in the can, there isn't as much timelessness as there is with ""The Simpsons.""Still, the energy and excellent writing makes this a good addition to the collection of any Evergreen Terrace fan, who can see that the talents of that show's extraordinary crew weren't limited to Springfield.",3,A little dated but still pretty funny,1074297600,"01 17, 2004",2004,1951,"['one', 'point', 'Simpsons', 'Season', '3', 'commentary', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'Al', 'Jean', 'Mike', 'Reiss', 'got', 'do', 'Critic', 'could', 'finally', 'write', 'film', 'parodies', 'wanted', 'Jean', 'response', 'basically', 'Look', 'how', 'far', 'went', 'Not', 'as', 'far', 'deserved', 'sadly', 'Critic', 'feels', 'creature', 'time', 'Satires', 'films', 'Cliffhanger', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'were', 'lot', 'funnier', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'fresh', 'people', 'heads', 'Still', 'Critic', 'had', 'one-liners', 'only', 'Simpsons', 'could', 'rival', 'Jay', 'why', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Beatles', 'broke', 'up', 'Franklin', 'should-have-been-classic', 'first', 'black', 'female', 'head', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'America', 'stinks', 'No', 'surprise', 'then', 'was', 'first', 'prime', 'time', 'cartoon', 'could', 'hold', 'own', 'frequently', 'surpass', 'Homer', 'gang', 'remember', 'Capital', 'Critters', ""'ll"", 'see', 'point', 'personally', 'prefer', 'Fox', 'episodes', 'rub', 'Jay', 'harsher', 'edges', 'Alice', 'big', 'help', 'go', 'loonier', 'directions', 'ABC', 'episodes', 'show', 'achingly', 'funny', 'moments', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'narrating', 'video', 'will', 'Have', 'Nice', 'Day', 'poster', 'calling', 'Jay', 'scum-sucking', 'loser', 'Simpsons', 'Critic', 'often', 'targeted', 'specific', 'fads', 'celebrities', 'are', 'funny', 'as', 'long', 'targets', 'are', 'public', 'mind', 'scene', 'Roseanne', 'terrorizing', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'lot', 'funnier', 'when', 'well', 'Roseanne', 'was', 'Clinton', 'jokes', 'are', 'already', 'frayed', 'edges', 'Critic', 'had', 'survived', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'noticeable', 'only', '23', 'episodes', 'can', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'timelessness', 'Simpsons', 'Still', 'energy', 'excellent', 'writing', 'good', 'addition', 'collection', 'Evergreen', 'Terrace', 'fan', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'talents', 'show', 'extraordinary', 'crew', 'were', ""n't"", 'limited', 'Springfield']",The Critic - The Complete Series
741046,A3JM7ZRLXC18UC,B00008EY6Q,Church of The Flaming Sword,"[36, 38]","The Critic is one brilliant animated TV show that suffered a fate that befell entirely too many other brilliant shows like Family Guy and The PJs.  These shows would be hyped up weeks before the first episode aired.  Then about 2-4 weeks into the series' first season (few of these shows lasted much longer than that), an entirely different series would air.  And thus, the series would be left in limbo for weeks, sometimes months before another episode made its way to its small, and impatient group of fans.  Because of this apathetic treatment from the networks, these shows were not given a sufficient opportunity to find an audience.  The Critic, which debuted on ABC in 1994, languished in this manner until Fox would pick it up a year later.  History would once again repeat itself on that network as well.  It's just shameful how not one, but two, networks could take such a clever, inventive show for granted.The Critic is about a very short pudgy New York City film critic and divorced father named Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz).  Sherman hates blockbuster films with a burning passion.  He makes his hatred known with two simple words: &quot;IT STINKS!!!&quot;.  This makes him one of the least popular people in the city.  John Rocker may get the key to the city before Sherman does if that tells you anything.  Sherman's life is full of some interesting and sometimes oddball characters.  He comes from a rich family - his mother is a haughty aristocrat and his father is still recovering from a stroke, which is evident with his eccentric behavior.  The only other normal person in Sherman's family is his loving, but slightly insecure teenage sister.  Sherman's best friend is an Australian actor who is basically cross between Mel Gibson and Paul Hogan.  The actor stars in precisely the same big budgeted films that Sherman likes to pan.  And finally there's his boss, a Southern-bred media tycoon would love to cancel Sherman's hugely unpopular show for purely business reasons, but the tycoon for some reason likes having Sherman around.What set The Critic apart from the other creative animated shows was how it would joke about cinema, much in the same way Family Guy would do to modern television, or how King of the Hill would do with rural stereotypes.  One of the funniest skits (Lord knows The Critic had a lot of them), involved a trailer with Arnold Schwarzeneggar in a Jewish-themed action film.  Arnold's new catch phrase was &quot;Haga Navilla, Baby!!!&quot;.  Pure hilarity.For those of you who can't get enough of these amazing animated shows like The Simpsons, Family Guy, and King of the Hill; you owe it to yourself to watch The Critic.  Once you've watched it, realize that it has been cancelled for nearly a decade, and see the sickening glut of reality shows that now reign over prime time with an oppresive fist - Don't be surprised to hear yourself saying this about the sickening state of 21st Century television: &quot;IT STINKS!!!&quot;",5,Grossly neglected.,1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,2986,"['Critic', 'one', 'brilliant', 'animated', 'TV', 'show', 'suffered', 'fate', 'befell', 'entirely', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'brilliant', 'shows', 'Family', 'Guy', 'PJs', 'shows', 'would', 'be', 'hyped', 'up', 'weeks', 'first', 'episode', 'aired', 'Then', '2-4', 'weeks', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'few', 'shows', 'lasted', 'much', 'longer', 'entirely', 'different', 'series', 'would', 'air', 'thus', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'limbo', 'weeks', 'sometimes', 'months', 'episode', 'made', 'way', 'small', 'impatient', 'group', 'fans', 'apathetic', 'treatment', 'networks', 'shows', 'were', 'not', 'given', 'sufficient', 'opportunity', 'find', 'audience', 'Critic', 'debuted', 'ABC', '1994', 'languished', 'manner', 'Fox', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'year', 'later', 'History', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'repeat', 'network', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'shameful', 'how', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'networks', 'could', 'take', 'clever', 'inventive', 'show', 'granted.The', 'Critic', 'very', 'short', 'pudgy', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'film', 'critic', 'divorced', 'father', 'named', 'Jay', 'Sherman', 'voiced', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Sherman', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'burning', 'passion', 'hatred', 'known', 'two', 'simple', 'words', 'quot', 'IT', 'STINKS', 'quot', 'one', 'least', 'popular', 'people', 'city', 'John', 'Rocker', 'may', 'get', 'key', 'city', 'Sherman', 'anything', 'Sherman', 'life', 'full', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'oddball', 'characters', 'rich', 'family', 'mother', 'haughty', 'aristocrat', 'father', 'still', 'recovering', 'stroke', 'evident', 'eccentric', 'behavior', 'only', 'other', 'normal', 'person', 'Sherman', 'family', 'loving', 'slightly', 'insecure', 'teenage', 'sister', 'Sherman', 'best', 'friend', 'Australian', 'actor', 'who', 'basically', 'cross', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'actor', 'stars', 'precisely', 'same', 'big', 'budgeted', 'films', 'Sherman', 'pan', 'finally', 'boss', 'Southern-bred', 'media', 'tycoon', 'would', 'love', 'cancel', 'Sherman', 'hugely', 'unpopular', 'show', 'purely', 'business', 'reasons', 'tycoon', 'reason', 'likes', 'having', 'Sherman', 'set', 'Critic', 'apart', 'other', 'creative', 'animated', 'shows', 'was', 'how', 'would', 'joke', 'cinema', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Family', 'Guy', 'would', 'do', 'modern', 'television', 'how', 'King', 'Hill', 'would', 'do', 'rural', 'stereotypes', 'One', 'funniest', 'skits', 'Lord', 'Critic', 'had', 'lot', 'involved', 'trailer', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzeneggar', 'Jewish-themed', 'action', 'film', 'Arnold', 'new', 'catch', 'phrase', 'was', 'quot', 'Haga', 'Navilla', 'Baby', 'quot', 'Pure', 'hilarity.For', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'amazing', 'animated', 'shows', 'Simpsons', 'Family', 'Guy', 'King', 'Hill', 'owe', 'watch', 'Critic', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'been', 'cancelled', 'nearly', 'decade', 'see', 'sickening', 'glut', 'reality', 'shows', 'now', 'prime', 'time', 'oppresive', 'fist', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'hear', 'saying', 'sickening', 'state', '21st', 'Century', 'television', 'quot', 'IT', 'STINKS', 'quot']",The Critic - The Complete Series

The funniest segments are always the movie ""trailers"" (""Brown Acres"" and ""Rabbi P.I."" being the best, in my opinion).  And for a show that's ten years old, it's aged remarkably well, and I laughed just as hard at the jokes.This box set includes every episode of the series, as well as commentaries.  My favorite episode by a long shot is ""Siskel & Ebert & Jay & Alice,"" which includes one of the funniest moments in television history- Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert getting into a fistfight, and then duetting on a love song.The box set also features ""webisodes,"" previously available only on the Internet, that feature Jay Sherman ""reviewing"" more recent films.

Though there are plenty of shows out there that I've watche more than this, I've probably watched 'The Critic' more per episode than any other one.(Well, 'The Simpsons' may still beat it, but nothing else, for sure) Also, the rerun schedule on Comedy Central had grown increasingly sporadic, so I hadn't actually seen it all that much the last couple of years, and I wasn't sure it was gonna hold up.  I eventually got it a couple months late, and it turns out that I like it about as much as ever.  Admittedly, it does have a few problems, particularly a couple running jokes that are kinda weak. (Too many fat jokes, easter island kid etc.)  Also, Jay isn't that great of a main character.  Pretty decent, but not as good as the central characters for an animated show generally ought to be.  Still, most of the film parodies are fairly classic, and it's got a first-rate cast of secondary characters, which is easily the most imporatant thing for an animated show.  Duke and Franklin are particularly good, with a succesful joke-rate startlingly close to 100%.  It's too bad it didn't stay on the air longer, as it usually takes a while to develop a full cast, and they were just getting around to really doing it when they got cut off.Anyway, there are only 23 episodes, but their isn't a genuine dud in the bunch, and they've all stood up to many, many repeat viewings over the years.

741056,A3QBFZ4BC3CSH5,B00008EY6Q,Heather Baldwin,"[8, 8]","I first caught The Critic on FOX when I was in high school, and although it was canceled, I was pleased to see that Comedy Central picked up the reruns a few years ago.  This underrated show, like many others, was simply a victim of politics among network executives.  One of the commentators on this DVD (I forget who) quoted Jonny Carson as saying, &quot;TV is only medium that eats its young&quot;, and that's very true in this case.  Fortunately The Critic developed enough of a following to be released on DVD, and so I will now review the DVD itself.Episodes - 5/5 - Great lines, characters, stories, and movie parodies.  The visual gags (such as the cartwheeling hampster) and sign jokes (United Nations School: Teaching Tolerance and Brotherhood To Those Who Can Afford It) have rivaled those on the Simpsons and Futurama.  The animation has a unique and naturalistic look that works very well: the people and places feel real.  Also, the writing and the acting are quite solid.Commentaries - 3/5 - The commentators are witty and informative, but my main complaint is that there are only eight episodes with commentaries.  I would have enjoyed commentaries on all of the episodes.  The other problem is that when I played the commentaries, the sound wasn't as good, and I had to turn the volume way up, not only to hear the episode, but to hear Charles Napier and Nick Jameson, who often talk softly.Subtitles/Language Options - 0/5 - There are no subtitles at all, which is particularly irritating when trying to listen to the commentary tracks.  And despite the FBI warnings being in both English and French, the audio is only in English.DVD package/menues - 2/5 - The outer package has little info about the DVD's contents.  There is a booklet inside that lists the episodes, but doesn't list the special features.  The DVD menues are simplified (for instance, there are no submenues for each episode).  Episodes with commentary available only have an asterisk in the Episode Selection Menu, and the names of the commentators are not shown, only spoken.Special Features - 5/5 - I was pleasantly surprised with the extras on this DVD.  They've included all ten of the internet shorts from 2000, which were cool to watch.  I particularly enjoyed the &quot;Making of the Critic&quot; featurette, which contained interviews with Mike Reiss, Al Jean, Jim Brooks, Rich Moore, Maurice La Marche, and Nick Jameson.  I like being able to finally match up a face with a voice!

It was a highly intelligent and very funny show that made fun of movies, Hollywood, TV stations at the same time as giving us a sympathetic hero and the whacky world he lives in.Jay Sherman is short, fat, bald and dresses like dweeb, his ex-wife hates him, his boss is always on his back, women run from him in terror and his make-up lady humiliates him at every given opportunity. He's also voiced by the increasingly adorable Jon Lovitz and has one of the best catchphrases ever. HOTCHIE MOTCHIE!!!!!The supporting characters are equally hilarious. Jay's crazy dad is always up to some kind of insanity. His pal Jeremy Hawke (star of the controversial and highly blasphemous Crocodile Gandhi movies) is always featured in some sort of dumb action movie clip. Even his tummy has a 'feed me' voice of its own. Though the honors go to Charles Napier, who is absolutely priceless as Jay's megalomaniacal, all-American hard-man boss.It's hard to believe ABC ditched this after ONE EPISODE!!! What were they thinking? Even Fox eventually gave up on it. Sad considering how sharp the writing and humor was. How on earth does self-indulgent, over-rated and long, long past prime trash like Friends gets 10 seasons and The Critic gets 23 episodes. You won't find Jay Sherman all but winking at the camera or pausing until the fake laughter dies down.This complete set comes with a fair amount of extras (the cinema screen trivia cards are great) but the best is fact that we get all the 'webisodes'. In 2000 Jay made a brief comeback on the internet and all those 5 minute shows are featured on the 3rd DVD. My only complaint is, after 22 brilliant episodes, it kind of dies out with an obnoxious and annoying 'clip show' than a proper end-of-season finale. Minor complaint nonetheless.The shows are all presented in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with a good Dolby 2.0 soundtrack. If Family Guy can come back through strong DVD sales then let's hope the same for The Critic.

Other than that, and the unchangeable fact that some of the jokes show their age...painfully, this show ranks up there with the smartest and most biting of all sitcoms. Sure this point is covered up by the rampant childish humor, but that is also the genious that was meant to be seen. A show where you must peel away the ill-contrivances to see the true core-meaning of it. It is stupid for the sake of being smart. I think that confusing point i just mentioned was the reason why this series was so short lived. People ,all to often, do not want to think about what they are watching. And since the obvious things that occur in these shows, on the face appear insipid, underneath they are genious.

Ironically, it lasted two half-seasons, but it's cult following has grown immensely over the past 10 years. Jon Lovitz voices Jay Sherman, a loser turned movie critic who gets no respect from anyone.

Lovitz is perfect as the lovable loser, and many of life's lessons portrayed in the movies wind up happening to the main character.The extras include cast and crew commentary on all episodes, a documentary and interviews.

I loved it when first appeared in the early 90s on ABC, and continued to love it on Fox and in reruns on Comedy Central.  The pop culture references mixed in with Simpsons-inspired craziness simply made this perfect television program for me.For those who were paying attention in the early 1990s, the Critic shined some hilarious and downright silly light on popular things of the time.  If you've seen the show on Comedy Central, you know whether or not this DVD is for you.  If you like making fun of now almost-archaic pop-culture from the 1990s, you'll enjoy this.If you're looking at this DVD, you've probably enjoyed the show already.  Every episode is intact, though the quality is sketchy.  First season episode's brightness, contrast, and even color balance seem somewhat questionable on my computer monitor.  The first season's colors look somewhat muddy, while the second season seems a little brighter and higher quality.  Did someone mishandle the original prints?The commentary is quite good, with some interesting, fast-paced commentary discussing a wide variety of topics.  The writers seem quite intelligent and funny, all the more shame this show got cancelled.  They discuss whether Jon Lovitz really is like Jay Sherman in real life, the history of the show's acceptance, or lack thereof, on its networks, and even discussing the policies of FOX handling television programs: namely, how incomprehensible, off-putting, and detrimental re-arranging schedules can be to a show's success.The writers even mention when they recorded the commentary; the day of California's gubernatorial vote, which Governor Schwarzenegger won and whose election the writers predict.  Am I declaring the commentators psychic?  No, otherwise they could have avoided The Critic's failure.  Hatchie matchie!It's simply a joy to see this wonderful show getting some wide distribution.  Here's to hoping to a future version of the DVD with higher quality video, commentaries for every episode with even more of the cast, and maybe real-life video interviews with the writers and cast.If you liked the Critic on TV, you will like this competently put-together DVD set.",4,A welcome gift for Critic fans,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,2213,"['Critic', 'television', 'program', 'know', 'best', 'loved', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'early', '90s', 'ABC', 'continued', 'love', 'Fox', 'reruns', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'mixed', 'Simpsons-inspired', 'craziness', 'simply', 'made', 'perfect', 'television', 'program', 'me.For', 'who', 'were', 'paying', 'attention', 'early', '1990s', 'Critic', 'shined', 'hilarious', 'downright', 'silly', 'light', 'popular', 'things', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'show', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'know', 'not', 'DVD', 'like', 'making', 'fun', 'now', 'almost-archaic', 'pop-culture', '1990s', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'this.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'already', 'episode', 'intact', 'quality', 'sketchy', 'First', 'season', 'episode', 'brightness', 'contrast', 'even', 'color', 'balance', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'questionable', 'computer', 'monitor', 'first', 'season', 'colors', 'look', 'somewhat', 'muddy', 'second', 'season', 'little', 'brighter', 'higher', 'quality', 'Did', 'someone', 'mishandle', 'original', 'prints', 'commentary', 'quite', 'good', 'interesting', 'fast-paced', 'commentary', 'discussing', 'wide', 'variety', 'topics', 'writers', 'seem', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'funny', 'more', 'shame', 'show', 'got', 'cancelled', 'discuss', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'really', 'Jay', 'Sherman', 'real', 'life', 'history', 'show', 'acceptance', 'lack', 'thereof', 'networks', 'even', 'discussing', 'policies', 'FOX', 'handling', 'television', 'programs', 'namely', 'how', 'incomprehensible', 'off-putting', 'detrimental', 're-arranging', 'schedules', 'can', 'be', 'show', 'success.The', 'writers', 'even', 'mention', 'when', 'recorded', 'commentary', 'day', 'California', 'gubernatorial', 'vote', 'Governor', 'Schwarzenegger', 'won', 'election', 'writers', 'predict', 'Am', 'declaring', 'commentators', 'psychic', 'No', 'otherwise', 'could', 'have', 'avoided', 'Critic', 'failure', 'Hatchie', 'matchie', 'simply', 'joy', 'see', 'wonderful', 'show', 'getting', 'wide', 'distribution', 'Here', 'hoping', 'future', 'version', 'DVD', 'higher', 'quality', 'video', 'commentaries', 'episode', 'even', 'more', 'cast', 'maybe', 'real-life', 'video', 'interviews', 'writers', 'cast.If', 'liked', 'Critic', 'TV', 'will', 'like', 'competently', 'put-together', 'DVD', 'set']",The Critic - The Complete Series

Sincerely, there are just so many cartoon series based for adults that really seem to be overdubbed again and again. That goes with the case of The Simpsons, and King Of The Hill, as them being the most successful of all the animated series for adults. Yet, typically speaking, there is one zany one that is worth seeing all over again. The Critic was one those animated series that truly brought out the best in crude, but laughable humor for all ages, young and old. The story is about a single father, Jay Sherman, who works as a movie critic, and all the weirdness that is around his world, including the basis from his parents, who adopted Jay, and his crazy boss Duke. Still, the sense of humor fits right in.The complete series DVD of The Critic consists of the only two channels that broadcasted whole episodes of the series, Fox and ABC. Arguably, the series was absoluely brillant and completely funny. Jon Lovitz, from Saturday Night Live fame, portrays the voice of the wacky Jay Sherman. The shows are just enjoyable, but does leave a whole lot of humor, from Jon and his parents who are the loose actual cannons, one of them who is sensible, but the other one that is drunk as a noose. Still, the show does evolve, Jay even more, including his humor as a critic, and some of the most outrageous things ever, including the episode where Duke, runs for president, and just makes so much of an ordeal, he actually controls the whole show, and the episode where Jay celebrates his a milestone show as the host of Coming Attractions, where they only shows clips of the films Jay reviewed. Unfortunately, that was the final episode of The Critic.Untimately, this was one of the best animation series of its era. The Critic was just full of complete joy. All that I can say is that I absolutely suggest you get this boxed set of the entire series, The Critic. No matter what people think of other series out there, Jay Sherman just brings down the house.

Unfortunately, a lot of people fell in the third category when flipping through channels in the mid-1990s, missing one of the greatest TV shows of all time.  Yes, The Critic is that good!  It is a sharp, biting comedy that never got the ratings or respect it deserved.From those that brought you the Simpsons, co-creators Al Jean and Mike Reiss developed a comedy that is basically the Jon Lovitz version of Homer Simpson.  The animation of the show is different, but the comedy is as witty.  Where The Critic differs from the Simpsons is in 1)less focus on socio-political issues--The Critic focused on making fun of the entertainment industry, and 2)the lack of a family.  Lovitz's Jay Sherman is a divorced, middle aged film reviewer with a son.  Sherman is the focus of the majority of the episodes, and as a result the plots did not require the creation of a large cast of characters.But, if you like Jon Lovitz, then the focus on Jay Sherman is not a negative. Jay Sherman the character was built for Lovitz, and Lovitz played the part well.  Sherman is a short, balding, overweight, irritable, and somewhat depressed character (especially in season one).  His failures and negative traits are part of the plots of the episodes--from ""running"" a marathon to his bad luck with women.  Like the Simpsons, The Critic builds its comedy in laughing at their characters but empathizing with them nonetheless.For those familiar with Lovitz's great acting talents, it is especially evident in The Critic.  The writers on the show allow Lovitz to highlight his operatic singing ability as well as his trademark...well...Jewishness.  Although Sherman is adopted, the writers make it crystal clear that Jay Sherman is Jewish.  Although the show is plenty funny for a Gentile, if you are Jewish you appreciate more of the jokes.  Sherman dancing and singing in fake Yiddish, the Howard Stern/Lion King sketch with the background cast singing ""Shalom Alechem,"" and on and on...some of the Critic's jokes are geared to an extent to Jewish humor...and Lovitz plays it well.  Nevertheless, The Critic is an equal opportunity comedy.  Celebrites are parodied (with particular focus on Orson Wells and the stereotypical action star), Fidel Castro makes an appearance, Jay's WASPy adopted parents are foils, and a Eastern European student at the U.N. School gets laughed at in an episode for performing a native song with the lyrics ""Tee-Pee Tee-Pee Pee-Pee Poo-Pee.""  No one is safe on The Critic.Problematically, some of the jokes and parodies are dated.  When Jay Sherman reviews films (actually the parodies of films), a teenager today may not recognize some of the films.  Silence Of The Lambs seems dated, even today.  To that end, The Critic does not age nearly as well as The Simpsons, which focuses more on universal themes.The DVD offers all episodes from its three seasons on FOX, ABC, and Comedy Central (unfortunately the show was cancelled twice), as well as the short episodes that appeared online a few years ago.  The extras on the DVD are fairly limited, as are the number of commentaries.  Regrettably, Jon Lovitz did not appear in ANY episode commentary, which is bizzare considering he did show up in Simpsons DVD commentaries!  Nevertheless, Al Jean and Mike Reiss do a great job in providing additional insight and laughs on the commentaries.For the Simpsons or Jon Lovitz fan, The Critic is a must own.

The Critic was a cartoon made awhile back and yet didn't stick around long enough. I am upset that the cartoon did end and they hardly ever show it on tv as reruns anymore so finally I just looked around to see if it was on DVD and sure enough I found it and did not hesitate buying it. I've always loved this cartoon when I saw it on tv, especially the fat little pig epidsode. That is probably the funniest Critic epidsode made, but honestly they're all funny. This cartoon was one of the funniest shows I have watched, it was like a cartoon that was not overly stupid nor overly intelligent, just right in between, like a cartoon should be. Some cartoons are too dumb though and some are too intelligent, making it a boring way to watch a cartoon show, but the Critic is a good balance and I think that's why I love it the most.The jokes are downright funny too. I love how they make fun of Jay Sherman's weight all the time (he is the Critic) like when he jumped on this waterbed on his honeymoon with his first wife and he blew out all the hotel windows with the water from the bed. Then they're always making fun of celebrities and films in real life and those are just so funny. The characters are great and humorous in their own way, but it is always Jay Sherman and his makeup lady Doris that bring the most humor, and great runners up is Jay's boss and also his father (who is a little on the nutty side).Growing up in this world, we all need a little humor once and awhile from like a bad day. Well when I pop in the Critic DVD on one of these hateful days, I am laughing in less than a few minutes. This cartoon is just that good. The fat little pig epidsode though has to be the best from that entire cartoon, it is just too funny.

741092,A3EUSQCI8G8D8O,B00008EY6Q,"The 747 Gambit ""500,000 Scoville Units""","[1, 1]","The Critic falls into the same gone-before-their-time comedy shows of my past - The State, Family Guy, Sifl and Olly, and the underrated Chimp Channel. Okay, with the exception of the Chimp Channel, it has seemed for years without fail, any show that I found humor in was quickly axed. I had just discovered the Critic when it disappeared, lingering around in syndication before going to join the televised wreckage heap of the past.But thanks to DVD, the Critic has returned to the small screen, and for some who actually remember the show, this is a good thing. For those who don't, know what you're getting into before somebody recommends this show...like me.Fans of the Simpsons or Family Guy will feel as if they've entered an alternate, if eerily similar, TV dimension. The show centers around a fat loser, Jay Sherman (a despised movie critic voiced by Jon Lovitz, essentially playing himself). But, unlike Homer or Peter Griffin, Jay isn't stupid - far from it. And, true to real life, nobody likes a know-it-all. Jay suffers from a near total lack of respect, an inability to attract women, and a whole host of other life issues that would crush a non-cartoon character to death, including a spiteful ex-wife and an abusive boss. But Jay weathers the slings and arrows with snappy one-liners and more ""I'm fat!"" and ""I'm Jewish!"" jokes than anyone should be forced to endure over a 22-minute stretch. But he is ultimately a funny character, and highly sympathetic.The rest of the cast is good, but not great. The late Doris Grau does an amazing turn as Jay's embittered, chain smoking personal stylist, while Gerrit Graham (as Jay's insane father, Franklin) and Charles Napier (as Jay's Ted-Turner-like boss Duke) both do marvelous work with their characters. The rest of the characters, while having occasional fun moments, are a supporting cast in every sense of the word 'supporting'. The show truly centers around Jay, and thus has less flexibility to pursue different character story-lines, like when the Simpson do a ""Lisa"" episode or the Family Guy might do a ""Brian"" episode. All Critic episodes are above and beyond Jay episodes, though this isn't necessarily a bad thing.The animation changes noticeably from Season 1 to Season 2, starting out with extremely muted, earthy colors. Remember how trees were predominately purple in the Simpsons for a while? Well, the people responsible for coloring the early Critic were in love with greens, grays, and browns, so the visual style of the first season is a bit drab. Season 2 looks more lively, with brighter colors and main characters getting slight makeovers. The look always tends towards realism, except for the actual people, who have a stylized look without a central theme, a different take than that in (I apologize for my 15th ""Simpsons"" reference here) the Simpsons, where most characters share Matt Groening's googly-eyes and overbite look.The writing is usually top-notch, if a little heavy on the afore-mentioned fat and Jewish jokes. There's plenty of satire and social commentary, though nothing too heavy-handed. The show's funniest moments come during Jay's reviews of movies, which are themselves hilarious parodies of actual movies, usually in the form of a sequel to a film that needed, or couldn't possibly have had, a sequel. I wouldn't recommend the series for these short segments alone, but they help ground the show and add a fresh change from the usual story-driven fare.So, overall, if the idea of yet another smart-alecky cartoon show rooted in those carefree days of the late 90's appeals to you, give the Critic a try. Not every episode is sure-fire funny, but there are enough funny episodes to make this a worthwhile collection.",4,It Doesn't Stink.,1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,3727,"['Critic', 'same', 'gone-before-their-time', 'comedy', 'shows', 'past', 'State', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Sifl', 'Olly', 'underrated', 'Chimp', 'Channel', 'Okay', 'exception', 'Chimp', 'Channel', 'seemed', 'years', 'fail', 'show', 'found', 'humor', 'was', 'quickly', 'axed', 'had', 'just', 'discovered', 'Critic', 'when', 'disappeared', 'lingering', 'around', 'syndication', 'going', 'join', 'televised', 'wreckage', 'heap', 'past.But', 'thanks', 'DVD', 'Critic', 'returned', 'small', 'screen', 'who', 'actually', 'remember', 'show', 'good', 'thing', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'somebody', 'show', 'me.Fans', 'Simpsons', 'Family', 'Guy', 'will', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'entered', 'alternate', 'eerily', 'similar', 'TV', 'dimension', 'show', 'around', 'fat', 'loser', 'Jay', 'Sherman', 'despised', 'movie', 'critic', 'voiced', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'essentially', 'playing', 'Homer', 'Peter', 'Griffin', 'Jay', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'far', 'true', 'real', 'life', 'nobody', 'know-it-all', 'Jay', 'suffers', 'near', 'total', 'lack', 'respect', 'inability', 'attract', 'women', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'life', 'issues', 'would', 'crush', 'non-cartoon', 'character', 'death', 'including', 'spiteful', 'ex-wife', 'abusive', 'boss', 'Jay', 'slings', 'arrows', 'snappy', 'one-liners', 'more', ""'m"", 'fat', ""'m"", 'Jewish', 'jokes', 'anyone', 'should', 'be', 'forced', 'endure', 'over', '22-minute', 'stretch', 'ultimately', 'funny', 'character', 'highly', 'sympathetic.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'late', 'Doris', 'Grau', 'amazing', 'turn', 'Jay', 'embittered', 'chain', 'smoking', 'personal', 'stylist', 'Gerrit', 'Graham', 'Jay', 'insane', 'father', 'Franklin', 'Charles', 'Napier', 'Jay', 'Ted-Turner-like', 'boss', 'Duke', 'do', 'marvelous', 'work', 'characters', 'rest', 'characters', 'having', 'occasional', 'fun', 'moments', 'are', 'supporting', 'cast', 'sense', 'word', ""'supporting"", 'show', 'truly', 'centers', 'Jay', 'thus', 'less', 'flexibility', 'pursue', 'different', 'character', 'story-lines', 'when', 'Simpson', 'do', 'Lisa', 'episode', 'Family', 'Guy', 'might', 'do', 'Brian', 'episode', 'Critic', 'episodes', 'are', 'Jay', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing.The', 'animation', 'changes', 'noticeably', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '2', 'starting', 'out', 'extremely', 'muted', 'earthy', 'colors', 'Remember', 'how', 'trees', 'were', 'predominately', 'purple', 'Simpsons', 'while', 'Well', 'people', 'responsible', 'coloring', 'early', 'Critic', 'were', 'love', 'greens', 'grays', 'browns', 'visual', 'style', 'first', 'season', 'bit', 'drab', 'Season', '2', 'more', 'lively', 'brighter', 'colors', 'main', 'characters', 'getting', 'slight', 'makeovers', 'look', 'always', 'towards', 'realism', 'actual', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'stylized', 'look', 'central', 'theme', 'different', 'take', 'apologize', '15th', 'Simpsons', 'reference', 'here', 'Simpsons', 'where', 'most', 'characters', 'share', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'googly-eyes', 'overbite', 'look.The', 'writing', 'usually', 'top-notch', 'little', 'heavy', 'afore-mentioned', 'fat', 'Jewish', 'jokes', 'plenty', 'satire', 'social', 'commentary', 'nothing', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'show', 'funniest', 'moments', 'come', 'Jay', 'reviews', 'movies', 'are', 'hilarious', 'parodies', 'actual', 'movies', 'usually', 'form', 'sequel', 'film', 'needed', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'have', 'had', 'sequel', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'series', 'short', 'segments', 'alone', 'help', 'ground', 'show', 'add', 'fresh', 'change', 'usual', 'story-driven', 'fare.So', 'overall', 'idea', 'yet', 'smart-alecky', 'cartoon', 'show', 'rooted', 'carefree', 'days', 'late', '90', 'appeals', 'give', 'Critic', 'try', 'Not', 'episode', 'sure-fire', 'funny', 'are', 'enough', 'funny', 'episodes', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'collection']",The Critic - The Complete Series
741093,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B00008EY6Q,Twiddles42,"[5, 5]","The commentary alone makes the series worth the buy.  While they did more reminiscing and laughing, they did mention some juicy behind the scenes stuff.  It's nice to know why ABC cancelled the show (too racy), why FOX picked it up (make it racy), and why they cancelled it (they didn't own it and as such couldn't profit much from it - the show did have plenty of viewers...)There's even a storyboard for an episode or two, these discs are jam-packed...The DVD's episode order must be in production order as the airdate order is quite different...I saw the FOX series halfway through its run and I loved it.  It was so fresh, so different, so atypical of mainstream drivel.  So naturally I'd love it.  I'd never seen the ABC series until purcashing the set.  I must say the ABC series is somewhat funnier and more relevant to/critical of the movie industry.The ABC series, which started it all, has some great episodes.  The pilot sets it all up, followed by &quot;Miserable&quot; (it spoofs the movie &quot;Misery&quot; (as I think it was called) and has a lot of very funny moments), &quot;Marathon Mensch&quot;, &quot;A Pig-Boy and His Dog&quot;, &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; (my all time favorite), and &quot;Every Doris Has Her Day&quot;.  There really isn't a clunker amongst the bunch.The best FOX episodes to look out for are &quot;Chunk to Hunk&quot;, &quot;Dukearella&quot;, &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;, &quot;All the Duke's Men&quot;, and &quot;Frankie and Ellie get Lost&quot;.  They come to mind as being utter classics, and the Star Trek TNG parody in &quot;Sherman of Arabia&quot; is NOT to be missed!  (it was so nice, at the time, to finally see somebody poke fun at a Star Trek show that wasn't about Kirk.)  And catch other episodes for the digs aimed at ABC, those are a real riot, especially the bit in &quot;Sherman of Arabia&quot; where Jay wants Alice and daughter Penny to watch 'wholesome ABC comedy'...  LOL!  You can bet your bippy I won't divulge its details, but it is hilarious!  The only real clunker from the FOX series is &quot;A Song for Margo&quot;, though it had a few cute lines as well.  So watch that one last.  :-)  And while okay, the Siskel and Ebert episode seemed lackluster and ultimately became silly.  But that's just my impression, and I'm weird.I won't mention the FOX season's clip show, featuring clips from the ABC season.  You can watch it, but it's pointless unless you haven't seen the ABC episodes.  Well, not really - the bits that aren't clips are funny, and you wouldn't believe who'd guest-starred...  so, it's worth watching too.  :-)Ultimately, both seasons are highly witty and entertaining in their own ways, but they are slightly different in their approach.  But if you're a fan, you already know this!  :-)Now why did I take off a star?* Trailers.  I was expecting original commercials from &quot;The Critic&quot;.  Not adverts for mainstream Sony shows I could care less about.  I want material RELEVANT to the show being sold, I'm sorry.  This is just a nitpick as I am tired of the industry throwing in promos for shows that I'll never watch, let alone care for.  Besides, how many people who like &quot;The Critic&quot; go for the mainstream stuff that everybody already knows about anyway, and would you EVER see &quot;The Critic&quot; trailers on some other DVD?  (if they took the time to even take a guess at what people buying DVD X would like, having specialized promos would be better than just shoving anything and everything at us.)  This is worth 1/2 star removal, mainly because I'm in such a good mood from critiquing the good points of this set.  :-)  So I won't see original Critic advertisements.  Oh well, applesauce happens.* This one is not much of a quibble as I've seen far worse DVD image quality (think &quot;Three's Company&quot; season 1 as an example...):  &quot;Family Guy&quot; season 3 managed to squeeze 8 episodes on a disc and have virtually perfect video quality and had commentary as well.  How come &quot;The Critic&quot; has visible DVD compression in all the episodes?!  (do note, it is much easier to see this compression artifacting when you pause a frame, and I'll admit it's not as easy to spot here as it is in lower quality releases...)  In all honesty, considering everything jammed onto these three discs, the compression is not that bad and I've seen far worse in terms of picture quality.  So maybe this is worth 1/4 star.  Just another quibble, really.  I just wanted to add filler material.At $34.95, this is a steal for fans and is easily worth the risk for anybody curious of the series.  It's well worth the money.  And I was stupid enough not to have checked Amazon.com first!  (I'd spent $44.95 elsewhere...  oops.  Even then, it's worth the price, but I rather like $35 over $45, don't you?)",4,$34.99 is a killer price for this AWESOME series!,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,4813,"['commentary', 'alone', 'series',
