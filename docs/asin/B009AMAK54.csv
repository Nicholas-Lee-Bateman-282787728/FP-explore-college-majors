I love Clint Eastwood.  The story is good.  By the way, I love baseball as well, even to the point of moving to Cooperstown for a number of years.  So loving Eastwood and baseball makes this film a winner for me.  However, there is more to the story.  It is a counterpoint to Money Ball and shows the problems of a young person (daughter in her 30s) coping with an aging grumpy father (Eastwood).  Such a situation is the case with my brother and his daughters and is probably the case for many younger people these days.  As a result, I bought copies for my brother and each of his two daughters as gifts.  Perhaps it will help them to understand each other better.

There is some nice character development, a killer performance by Amy Adams and some nicely toned dialog that keeps the film freely moving, even in parts that could otherwise drag.  I will say; it does feel long.  By the time the draft picks are made I really thought the film would be over, but it wasn't.  That being said, it's an enjoyable film with some heart.Eastwood does Eastwood well and Timberlake continues to prove himself the next Matthew McConaughey (you know, charisma without the ability to do something special with a performance), but Adams is the real reason to see this.  I have never considered her a true leading lady, but she knocked this one out of the park with a genuinely heartfelt turn as an ambitious lawyer concerned with the welfare of her aging father.  Gus is a scout for the Braves, but his stubborn demeanor and seeming lack of success have his superiors questioning his relevance.  He's sent to tail a prospective #1 pick, but his failing eyesight is a concern and his daughter Mickey gets roped into tagging along to help him out.  While on the road they both strike up a friendship with a scout for the Red Sox and they begin to find out things about themselves they've been shielding for a long time.I'll say that there are some very predictable turns of events here, and there are also some segments that make no sense (especially the film's resolve) but at the end of the day it was charming and had nice flow and Adams really makes up for a lot of the film's faults.

1591032,A2582KMXLK2P06,B009AMAK54,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Trouble With the Curve is a really nice movie that takes place in a small town.  It's basically a light comedy and a light drama for that matter about scouting the best baseball players for the major league, but what elevates the movie to greatness probably has to do with the actors/actresses, which are all really spectacular and deserving of their big name well-known success.You can probably guess the biggest one I'm going to mention since he's sort of legendary- Clint Eastwood!  He's wonderful.  He plays a grumpy old scout that has vision problems, but that doesn't prevent him from acknowledging the bigger picture- that he has a talent for knowing the good players from the bad.  Listen up young men- take Clint's advice since he's been around for a while.  His daughter is the center of the storyline.  Played by the beautiful and charming Amy Adams, she's constantly fighting and bickering with her father concerning her troubled childhood and why Clint Eastwood basically gave her away as a child, as well as informing people that she's more suitable for the scouting job than anyone else in that office.  Her baseball knowledge is just incredible.Robert Patrick is one of the more underrated actors and a personal favorite of mine (DARN IT for the Unit being cancelled so soon!).  Justin Timberlake -while I'm certainly not a fan of his music, he plays a genuine good guy/boyfriend of Amy Adams in this movie.  We all John Goodman for his role in the Flintstones.  Haha, just kidding.  Roseanne all the way!  Bob Gunton- yes I recognize him from the hit TV show 24.  Matthew Lillard is the man who plays the guy everyone hates, being a know-it-all jerk and everything.  We want to see him make wrong decisions and take his walking papers!Basically Trouble With the Curve is one of those feel-good type family movies that does everything correctly.  It's a movie that probably plays it safe with the storytelling more often than not, and any boring moments are occasional and quickly veer in a more constructive/enticing direction so there's always something to look forward to.  Perhaps light on substance, but again, the big name actors/actresses makes up for that tiny flaw.

Amy Adams, one of my favorite actresses who rarely makes a misfire.  Justin Timberlake, who I think is actually better as an actor than as a singer (check out ""The Social Network"" if you disagree.)  And John Goodman, who -- minus ""Roseanne"" -- is always good for a really good laugh.I could argue that the dialog is full of sports clich&eacute;s, and I would have a strong argument there.  However, in reality, people often speak in clich&eacute;s in real life -- particularly sports; have you ever listened to a sports broadcast? -- so I don't always have a problem with it in film.  But worse, ""Trouble with the Curve"" feels overly manipulative to me.  You've got the daughter-who's-still-upset-with-daddy thing going on.  You've got the old-timer-who's-career-is-coming-to-a-close thing going on as well.  And you've got the unnecessary-love-triangle thing that might be the worst.  The entire plot just felt terribly contrived to me.It looks like Mr. Eastwood didn't direct this film, and perhaps if he had, it would have surely been better.  I think that if he had directed, he would have required a rewrite on the script, and he would have made it less manipulative.

Ad...","[0, 0]","This movie moves swiftly but has a few wise messages for viewers of all ages if they pay attention.The  main message here is that, you might be older, you might feel older- but that doesn't mean you still don't have something to offer the world.In this story, Eastwood is angry. Even on a good day, he is angry.While he has always been an angry sort of guy,  now he is angry because he is noticing the signs of aging that he fears could hold him back or cost him, his beloved career as a baseball talent scout.He might have physical problems- but he is still mentally sharp and for the most part, a mobile man- as long as you don't give him a car to drive. :-)Eastwood's ""Damn it all"" attitude, is all about not giving in to things that slow you down or prove to be an obstacle.Despite his looming health issues, he won't hang up his cap just yet!You find yourself rooting for him and admiring his pride, while feeling his embarrassment just as equally, when he uses tactics( some successfully- some not so successfully) to cover up his physical deficits.In fact, in defiance( and some would say stupidity) he opts to ignore his problems and blow off further medical assistance( at least, perhaps, for the time being ) in order to go scout the latest and greatest out there.He has to see just how authentic these hyped up school baseball players supposedly are- not just because it is in his blood- but because his career is also in jeopardy.And he has to ABSOLUTELY GET THE NEXT DRAFT PICK, RIGHT. He can't afford to make a mistake, especially now.This is a man whose identity is very wrapped up in his career.If forced to retire when his contract runs out in 3 months- you might as well just kill the guy.He lives, eats, breathes and sleeps baseball.There may be other things he can do- but he wants to remain  a talent scout.The idea of retirement sends a fury through him, so this particular venture of scouting out the players, just 3 months before he could be forced into retirement, proves to be so extra serious for him.It is an understatement to say,the week of scouting proves to be very intense as Eastwood tries incredibly hard not to drop the proverbial ball.His daughter is played by Amy Adams.She gets wind of his problems thanks to her father's friend( played by John Goodman) and despite her own promising career in a law office, and with the strong chance at partnership on the horizon, she decides to leave everything at work to intervene and attempt to help her Dad out.This means she takes off from her job at a critical time, a time when a major legal case hangs in the balance, as well as the pending decision on whether she makes the cut  as  a firm partner.Eastwood has no idea of the sacrifice his daughter has made.All he knows is he doesn't want her hanging around.It is not long before he gets a revelation he is forced to accept:he comes to realize, much to his chagrin, he really does need her around.Their relationship has long been troubled and very complex.Despite having a grumpy man for a Dad, a man who seems to disdain meaningful conversation, Adams has compassion for him and his plight.  She makes the decision to tag along with Eastwood for  the week, to check out the talent with him.She frequently calls into work to make sure they realize that while she has to take this week break, she is very serious about her job, the pending legal case and her partnership.She has worked there many years, putting in long hours, to make her mark, she is not about to give it up so easily.Her office is not happy she is gone.The veiled threats start to happen. Adams tries to appease them, saying when she gets back, she will have things on track.Yet, despite knowing what she might lose, the priority of her job( and chance at partner) is superseded by her need to help her Dad.Or perhaps, deep in her heart,she knows it is more than compassion- but love that is making her stay with him-  despite his his cantankerous behavior and personality quirks.Though the phone calls begin to allude her place in the company is shifting on her, she still makes the decision to stay with Eastwood and not yet return to work. This despite her bosses gentle, yet  pressing request to come back to work a.s.a.p.So you have Eastwood, pissed off about her coming along, clueless as to what his daughter might be putting in jeopardy FOR HIM; while she feels a deep sense of obligation to Eastwood, even though her father has failed her in  many ways, growing up.And so the story unfolds: a man desperately trying to hold on to his career, resisting the truth about his health issues, pissed off about getting older, and feeling both resentful -outwardly- and loving and proud-inwardly- toward his adult daughter.They may be blood related but in so many ways they are total strangers to one another.The movie covers the week the two are off on this journey of scouting.But it covers more than just baseball, even though that is the obvious theme of the movie.Justin Timberlake is a key character in the movie as well, but rather than explain his role, I will just say that he is a part of Eastwood's past and could possibly be a part of Adams future- if she ever decides to break down the emotional barriers she has erected over the years.Barriers meant to keep from feeling rejected and unloved, as she often felt from her father growing up and into adulthood.It is a fast paced movie and I enjoyed it.While based on baseball, there are other themes going on in the movie,  so everyone can watch this and appreciate it, even if they know nothing about baseball.Side note of trivia: Adams has an attorney boyfriend she is seeing.He is seen briefly, but he is played by Mariska Hargitay's real life husband.",4,"A nice

Clint Eastwood is pitch perfect as an elderly ""loveable curmudgeon"" - and the story poses the question whether it's time for him to pack it in and retire, or bring his 50+ year career as a major league baseball scout to a marvelous pinnacle. The adorable Amy Adams plays his 33 year old daughter, seeking to reconcile ""daddy's sort-of-absent love"" with her own actual inner strength, and the fact that she is a perfect female, and younger, version (in all the good ways) of her tough, masterful, no-nonsense father. Justin Timberlake plays the intelligent, honest and gentle suitor for the daughter's affections- enhanced by the fact that her father (the Eastwood character) was his mentor as well, a few years back. Sure- all of this is stock-ish movie making characterzation- maybe even ""predictable,"" but so are most excellent things in life on one level. It is also alive and fresh, and thoroughly sweet and inspiring.

1591081,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B009AMAK54,C. Sawin,"[1, 2]","""Trouble with the Curve"" is Clint Eastwood's first acting role since 2008's ""Gran Torino."" Eastwood was talked out of acting retirement for this movie. The San Francisco born actor turned 82 this year and it seems as though ""Trouble with the Curve"" took advantage of his age. Eastwood plays Gus; a baseball scout who is too stubborn to retire or make time to deal with his health issues. While this is probably the best way to approach writing a character for someone of Eastwood's age, ""Trouble with the Curve"" often feels like surveillance footage of Clint Eastwood being ancient rather than being anything substantial. The health issues in the movie relate to his eyesight, so seeing him run into furniture or not being able to see a baseball player swing a bat are vital to that story point. So did we really need to see him have trouble urinating or curse at his bladder the entire time?The drama feels pretty unbearable until Gus's daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) enters the picture. Adams makes ""Trouble with the Curve"" worthwhile thanks to her strong on-screen presence. Her performance makes it seem like she really is Gus's daughter as she has stubbornness and is extremely tough, but at the same time she's extremely smart-witted and incredibly flawed thanks to how Gus always put baseball before his daughter.Meanwhile, Justin Timberlake isn't bad but doesn't really stand out either. Johnny Flanagan (Timberlake) was a pitcher who could once pitch a fastball at over 100mph, but eventually threw his arm out and is now a scout for the Braves just like Gus. His one-liners are often pretty humorous, but his performance overall seems to struggle to be as charming or even keep up with Adams' performance.The forced relationship between Gus and Mickey is the heart and soul of the movie. Not only is that a focal point of the story, but the chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams is what keeps the movie from being a complete train wreck. Gus still grieves over the loss of his wife and feels like he did what was best for his daughter while Mickey feels as though Gus pushed her away to keep baseball the main priority in his life. Their arguments and their bonding moments are when ""Trouble with the Curve"" is at its best.The Gus character has the same problem that Hushpuppy's dad Wink did in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" If the character wasn't so stubborn, his issues wouldn't be as inflated as they turn out to be. But at the same time, you wouldn't have the same journey laid out before you and the final product wouldn't be nearly as interesting.In what is quite possibly the best scene in ""Trouble with the Curve,"" a man hits on Mickey at a bar and grabs her arm and Gus ends up stepping in and threatening the guy with a broken beer bottle. As the confrontation escalates, Johnny steps in, makes a smart aleck comment and the guy eventually walks away. The scene combines humor, intensity, and drama into one sequence that lasts only a few moments, but its consequences are felt long after and when its finally revealed why Gus jumped in then it gains quite a bit of depth as well.The issue with ""Trouble with the Curve"" is that it's nothing special. While it certainly may contribute that the person writing this review isn't a fan of any sport, that doesn't always play a factor as ""Moneyball"" from last year was pretty good. If you can get past Eastwood whispering nearly every line, then he doesn't do too bad of a job here. Amy Adams is the only reason you should really go to see this though. She's really coming into her own as an actress and does an exceptional job here. ""Trouble with the Curve"" does take a while to get going, but thanks to the tainted father/daughter relationship at its core is much more sentimental than it lets on.",3,Kind of a struggle to endure,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,3772,"['Trouble', 'Curve', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'first', 'acting', 'role', '2008', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'talked', 'acting', 'retirement', 'movie', 'San', 'Francisco', 'born', 'actor', 'turned', '82', 'year', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'took', 'advantage', 'age', 'Eastwood', 'Gus', 'baseball', 'scout', 'who', 'too', 'stubborn', 'retire', 'make', 'time', 'deal', 'health', 'issues', 'probably', 'best', 'way', 'approach', 'writing', 'character', 'someone', 'Eastwood', 'age', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'often', 'surveillance', 'footage', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'being', 'ancient', 'rather', 'being', 'anything', 'substantial', 'health', 'issues', 'movie', 'relate', 'eyesight', 'so', 'seeing', 'run', 'furniture', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'baseball', 'player', 'swing', 'bat', 'are', 'vital', 'story', 'point', 'So', 'did', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'have', 'trouble', 'urinating', 'curse', 'bladder', 'entire', 'time', 'drama', 'pretty', 'unbearable', 'Gus', 'daughter', 'Mickey', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'picture', 'Adams', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'worthwhile', 'thanks', 'strong', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'performance', 'seem', 'really', 'Gus', 'daughter', 'stubbornness', 'extremely', 'tough', 'same', 'time', 'extremely', 'smart-witted', 'incredibly', 'flawed', 'thanks', 'how', 'Gus', 'always', 'put', 'baseball', 'daughter.Meanwhile', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'Johnny', 'Flanagan', 'Timberlake', 'was', 'pitcher', 'who', 'could', 'once', 'pitch', 'fastball', '100mph', 'eventually', 'threw', 'arm', 'now', 'scout', 'Braves', 'just', 'Gus', 'one-liners', 'are', 'often', 'pretty', 'humorous', 'performance', 'overall', 'struggle', 'be', 'charming', 'even', 'keep', 'up', 'Adams', 'performance.The', 'forced', 'relationship', 'Gus', 'Mickey', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'chemistry', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'what', 'movie', 'being', 'complete', 'train', 'wreck', 'Gus', 'still', 'loss', 'wife', 'feels', 'did', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'daughter', 'Mickey', 'feels', 'Gus', 'pushed', 'away', 'keep', 'baseball', 'main', 'priority', 'life', 'arguments', 'bonding', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'best.The', 'Gus', 'character', 'same', 'problem', 'Hushpuppy', 'dad', 'Wink', 'did', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'stubborn', 'issues', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'inflated', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'same', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'journey', 'laid', 'out', 'final', 'product', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'interesting.In', 'what', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'scene', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'man', 'Mickey', 'bar', 'grabs', 'arm', 'Gus', 'up', 'stepping', 'threatening', 'guy', 'broken', 'beer', 'bottle', 'confrontation', 'Johnny', 'steps', 'smart', 'aleck', 'comment', 'guy', 'eventually', 'away', 'scene', 'combines', 'humor', 'intensity', 'drama', 'one', 'sequence', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'consequences', 'are', 'felt', 'long', 'when', 'finally', 'revealed', 'why', 'Gus', 'jumped', 'then', 'gains', 'quite', 'bit', 'depth', 'well.The', 'issue', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'nothing', 'special', 'certainly', 'may', 'contribute', 'person', 'writing', 'review', ""n't"", 'fan', 'sport', ""n't"", 'always', 'play', 'factor', 'Moneyball', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'Eastwood', 'whispering', 'nearly', 'line', 'then', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'bad', 'job', 'here', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'only', 'reason', 'should', 'really', 'go', 'see', 'though', 'really', 'coming', 'own', 'actress', 'exceptional', 'job', 'here', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'take', 'while', 'get', 'going', 'thanks', 'tainted', 'father/daughter', 'relationship', 'core', 'much', 'more', 'sentimental']",Trouble with the Curve

Add that to my lifelong admiration for Clint Eastwood and the fact that I find Amy Adams to be absolutely charming and very easy on the eyes makes ""Trouble With The Curve"" a true home run for me.It's obvious that Clint Eastwood is slowing down a bit with age, but that just makes him the perfect fit here for the aging baseball scout who scouts for the Atlanta Braves but is having vision problems.  Since it's hard to actually scout anything without proper vision, his estranged daughter, played by Adams, who is a hot-shot lawyer on the partner path decides to join him out on the road for his latest scouting mission.""Trouble With The Curve"" is a quiet little movie that may telegraph its pitches a bit, but for me that just added to the charm of the movie.  There are no major twists and turns, just a simple and heartfelt story being told with grace.  Adam's character wants to know why her dad abandoned her after her mother died when she was younger and Eastwood is reluctant to talk about it.  Both characters have their flaws and both of them have been carrying demons from the past.Justin Timberlake plays Johnny, a once hot-shot pitching phenom who was scouted by Eastwood and who then threw his arm out early in his career and is now scouting for the Red Sox in the hopes of landing a broadcasting job with the team.  His character plays nicely between Eastwood and Adams, helping bridge the gap between them and as he grows closer to Adams' character helps her understand that her old man may not be the cold guy she thinks he is.When it's all said and done, this isn't as much a baseball movie as it is a movie about the father and daughter relationship and a movie about why people follow paths that they may not want to follow.  The characters are all so very human and well played that it was a joy to watch.The bottom line is if you like quiet little movies about real people then you'll probably like ""Trouble With The Curve.""",5,Clint Eastwood May Be Slowing Down But He Can Still Hit The Curve,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,2005,"['have', 'say', 'up', 'front', 'like', 'baseball', 'movies', 'lot', 'Add', 'lifelong', 'admiration', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'fact', 'find', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'be', 'absolutely', 'charming', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'true', 'home', 'run', 'me.It', 'obvious', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'slowing', 'down', 'bit', 'age', 'just', 'perfect', 'fit', 'here', 'aging', 'baseball', 'scout', 'who', 'Atlanta', 'Braves', 'having', 'vision', 'problems', 'hard', 'actually', 'scout', 'anything', 'proper', 'vision', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'played', 'Adams', 'who', 'hot-shot', 'lawyer', 'partner', 'path', 'decides', 'join', 'out', 'road', 'latest', 'scouting', 'mission', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'quiet', 'little', 'movie', 'may', 'telegraph', 'pitches', 'bit', 'just', 'added', 'charm', 'movie', 'are', 'major', 'twists', 'turns', 'just', 'simple', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'grace', 'Adam', 'character', 'know', 'why', 'dad', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Eastwood', 'reluctant', 'talk', 'characters', 'have', 'flaws', 'have', 'been', 'carrying', 'demons', 'past.Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Johnny', 'once', 'hot-shot', 'pitching', 'phenom', 'who', 'was', 'scouted', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'then', 'threw', 'arm', 'out', 'early', 'career', 'now', 'scouting', 'Red', 'Sox', 'hopes', 'landing', 'broadcasting', 'job', 'team', 'character', 'nicely', 'Eastwood', 'Adams', 'helping', 'bridge', 'gap', 'closer', 'Adams', 'character', 'understand', 'old', 'man', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cold', 'guy', 'said', 'done', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'baseball', 'movie', 'movie', 'father', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'movie', 'why', 'people', 'follow', 'paths', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'follow', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'human', 'well', 'played', 'was', 'joy', 'watch.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'like', 'quiet', 'little', 'movies', 'real', 'people', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'Trouble', 'Curve']",Trouble with the Curve

1591088,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B009AMAK54,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","You would have thought the excellent ""Gran Torino"" would have been Clint Eastwood's swansong in front of the camera.  He must have found the script for ""Trouble with the Curve"" compelling enough that he had a change of heart.  Like most of the great baseball movies the sport is only a subtext.  The main themes here are family, friends, and loyalty.  Gus Lobel (Eastwood) has been a successful scout for the Braves for decades but he's slipping a little.  Instead of relying on the ""interweb"" for evaluating talent he depends on charts and his instincts in evaluating prospects.  There's a high school slugger in Gus' North Carolina territory that the organization is hot on and there is pressure on him to get the kid signed.  Mickey Lobel(Amy Adams) is a successful lawyer about to make partner who is aware of her father's travails.  As a young girl she used to travel with her father on scouting trips and a little of Gus' instincts rubbed off on her.  Despite her better instincts she drops everything to help her father.  Though not necessarily a dysfunctional relationship there is a bit of a disconnect. Mickey still harbors the wounds from being sent to live with relatives by Gus after her mother passed.  Throw in an amiable Red Sox scout (Justin Timberlake) who has as much an eye for the young slugger as for Mickey and you have a terrific dynamic.  As good as Eastwood is he wisely delegates the limelight to his younger co-stars.  John Goodman also turns in a good performance as Gus' friend in the organization.

My goodness, is film legend Clint Eastwood making a memorable ride into the sunset (arguing with an empty chair notwithstanding), not only as a gifted director/producer, but as a squinting, raspy-voiced actor.  You can't help but like him, which is why I so enjoyed TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE.  Here Eastwood plays aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout Gus--a seasoned veteran who avoids statistics and numbers to evaluate talent. Gus relies on the old eyeball test; trouble is, the old eyeballs are failing him.  And Gus has to deal with a Braves front office just itching to get rid of him, led by director of scouting operations Phillip (Matthew Lillard).  Yet also residing in the front office is Gus's good friend and ally Pete (John Goodman just keeps getting better and better).  With Gus en route to scout the most sought-after player in the country, a concerned Pete contacts Gus's estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), a busy lawyer on the fast track to make partner in her firm.  Yet Mickey takes a leave of absence to accompany her father; their reunion is bittersweet, to say the least.Over the course of Gus and Mickey's journey, they encounter Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former ballplayer and current Red Sox scout with broadcast aspirations.  Gus had once signed Johnny, so they're competitors on friendly terms, and Johnny is romantically attracted to an (initially) indifferent Mickey from the start.  So as the trio scouts the decided diva slugger named Bo (Joe Massingill makes this brat truly unlikable), who, as Gus insists to his superiors, has ""trouble with the curve,"" Gus and Mickey reconnect, Mickey and Johnny also connect, and, in the unlikeliest of places, Mickey discovers an amazing pitching talent who ultimately gives both Phillip and Bo their long overdue comeuppances.  Like Eastwood himself, the film occasionally feels a little long in the tooth, and meanders and flows a tad unevenly before recovering to deliver its predictable feel-good ending.  Yet these slight irritations take little away from TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE'S tender portrayal of a father and daughter finally getting acquainted after decades of estrangement.

The problem is that he never explained that to his daughter, he just left her with the aunt and uncle and headed out onto the road, thinking that somehow she'd come to magically understand why he had done what he'd done.Think about it for a minute.  How many times in our lives do we look back on the choices and actions of our parents and think to ourselves, WTF?  How could they have possibly done what they did if they'd had a clue?  However, life doesn't come with a hindsight manual that allows us a glimpse of the future to see how our choices will pan our for ourselves and our loved ones.That's what makes this story so meaningful. Regardless of what profession a parent is in, especially when they have lost their partner in life and the other parent to their children, every single choice and decision that the remaining parent makes becomes proportionately more important.  That kind of pressure and the desire to do the right thing can sometimes result in choices that the children wished their parents had never made, and that is what we see play out in this movie.Surprisingly enough, Justin Timberlake delivers a very funny and heartfelt performance as the love interest for Adams and the quasi-protege to Eastwood and his character acts as a bridge between the two in the film.Clint Eastwood is a phenomenal actor, delivering powerful performances time and again, and this movie is no different.  The ensemble cast is crisp and clean and John Goodman provides a great performance in the role of longtime friend and co-worker of Eastwood's character.This was a truly enjoyable movie from start to finish and I couldn't recommend it more highly.  If you want good story telling and a well crafted film, you'll find it here, and with the feel good twists and turns that some might call a bit predictable, it provides a very satisfying ending to the film.Pop some popcorn, make sure the beers are cold and have a few hot dogs at the ready and settle in for a real treat!",5,It's a human story more than it is about baseball...,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,2818,"['was', 'told', 'had', 'be', 'baseball', 'fan', 'grasp', 'fine', 'details', 'film', 'watching', 'learned', 'was', 'not', 'case.While', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'fantastically', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'baseball', 'scout', 'story', 'more', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'played', 'achingly', 'well', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'loss', 'Eastwood', 'wife', 'film.It', 'choices', 'make', 'so', 'ones', 'love', 'most', 'will', 'have', 'best', 'chance', 'success', 'based', 'point', 'view', 'time', 'choices', 'are', 'made', '*spoiler', 'alert*', 'near', 'miss', 'child', 'predator', 'when', 'Eastwood', 'daughter', 'very', 'young', 'road', 'scouting', 'next', 'great', 'thing', 'baseball', 'Eastwood', 'better', 'daughter', 'go', 'live', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'giving', 'stability', 'security', 'problem', 'never', 'explained', 'daughter', 'just', 'left', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'headed', 'out', 'road', 'thinking', 'somehow', ""'d"", 'come', 'magically', 'understand', 'why', 'had', 'done', 'what', ""'d"", 'done.Think', 'minute', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'lives', 'do', 'look', 'back', 'choices', 'actions', 'parents', 'think', 'ourselves', 'WTF', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'done', 'what', 'did', ""'d"", 'had', 'clue', 'However', 'life', ""n't"", 'come', 'hindsight', 'manual', 'glimpse', 'future', 'see', 'how', 'choices', 'will', 'pan', 'ourselves', 'loved', 'what', 'story', 'so', 'meaningful', 'Regardless', 'what', 'profession', 'parent', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'lost', 'partner', 'life', 'other', 'parent', 'children', 'single', 'choice', 'decision', 'remaining', 'parent', 'becomes', 'proportionately', 'more', 'important', 'kind', 'pressure', 'desire', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'can', 'sometimes', 'result', 'choices', 'children', 'wished', 'parents', 'had', 'never', 'made', 'what', 'see', 'play', 'out', 'movie.Surprisingly', 'enough', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'very', 'funny', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'love', 'interest', 'Adams', 'quasi-protege', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'bridge', 'two', 'film.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'phenomenal', 'actor', 'delivering', 'powerful', 'performances', 'time', 'again', 'movie', 'different', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'crisp', 'clean', 'John', 'Goodman', 'great', 'performance', 'role', 'longtime', 'friend', 'co-worker', 'Eastwood', 'character.This', 'was', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'could', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'more', 'highly', 'want', 'good', 'story', 'telling', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', 'here', 'feel', 'good', 'twists', 'might', 'call', 'bit', 'predictable', 'very', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'film.Pop', 'popcorn', 'make', 'sure', 'beers', 'are', 'cold', 'have', 'few', 'hot', 'dogs', 'ready', 'settle', 'real', 'treat']",Trouble with the Curve

The story line is fine, although it could have focused on certain aspects that would have built drama. The tumultuous upbringing of Amy Adams character, as a result of her mother dying so young, should have been a focus, yet it gets two short scenes in which to build from. We get that she is a miserable person, but you aren't sure if it is because her personality was developed from agony or because she inherited her fathers gruff manner. There is just little character development.For the baseball part of the story, which there isn't much, it is fine. The scenery of all of these minor league ballparks in GA is great. Loved that! You really come to hate the star prospect that Gus and many other scouts are following. The movie does a real good job there. Other parts are just rushed. The degrading of Gus' skills, the love development between Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake, the discovery of the hotel workers son as a major league pitcher are all just rushed and come off as hokey.Last negative is that Amy Adams is just miscast.

1591137,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B009AMAK54,FNDNreview,"[1, 1]","Trouble with the Curve stars Eastwood as Gus Lobel, an aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout that is sent to North Carolina to scout a first round prospect and possible future star of the organization.  The problem is Gus is losing his eye sight and can no longer visually see the game.  His friend and co-worker, Pete (John Goodman), asks Gus' daughter Mickey (Amy Adams), an ambitious lawyer trying to make partner, to accompany him on the trip.  Gus also reconnects with a failed prospect turned scout, Johnny (Justin Timberlake).As far as the acting goes for this off-field drama, there's really no need to critique anything that Dirty Harry does on film, quite simply because he's earned the right to do whatever he wants.  If he wants to play a cranky old baseball scout that's losing his sight, he should indulge himself.  Amy Adams is easily the most enjoyable character to watch and masters the part to the best of her ability, but unfortunately she is thrust into a love story with Justin Timberlake, which feels out of place and unnecessary for this film.  That's not to say Timberlake is bad in the role (since he has surprisingly turned out to be a decent actor), but there are already too many other variables to deal with without a forced/rushed love story complicating an already slow-moving story - namely stress father/daughter relationship.If you're a fan of sports films, it's highly doubtful that this will even come close to breaking your top twenty.  It is certainly no Moneyball, or even a Field of Dreams caliber experience.  It's more of a Sandlot type film that only uses baseball as a backdrop to further its predictable, lackluster plot.  Could this have been a football or basketball film?  Very easily.  The studio should be advised and encouraged to change the name of the film from Trouble with the Curve to Trouble with the Plot.  Just saying.Overall, anyone that loves Clint Eastwood will want to check out this film.  He is still a master of his craft and it will be a sad day when he decides to call it quits on his long-lived acting career.  Let's hope he stays in the directors chair, though.  In any event, this film could have also been so much more to look at visually.  Instead, audiences are forced to look at a high school baseball stadium backdrop for the majority of the film, giving it the 'cheat seats' quality feeling.  For a film that had such high potential, it felt too busy and drawn out - not to mention sappy and bland.  Aside from the acting, it really did provide a high amount of disappointment.Friday Night Date Night ReviewFollow us at: Facebook.com/FNDNReview",2,The trouble is watching 'The Curve',1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,2619,"['Trouble', 'Curve', 'stars', 'Eastwood', 'Gus', 'Lobel', 'aging', 'Atlanta', 'Braves', 'baseball', 'scout', 'sent', 'North', 'Carolina', 'scout', 'first', 'round', 'prospect', 'possible', 'future', 'star', 'organization', 'problem', 'Gus', 'losing', 'eye', 'sight', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'visually', 'see', 'game', 'friend', 'co-worker', 'Pete', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Gus', 'daughter', 'Mickey', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'ambitious', 'lawyer', 'trying', 'make', 'partner', 'accompany', 'trip', 'Gus', 'also', 'failed', 'prospect', 'turned', 'scout', 'Johnny', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', '.As', 'far', 'acting', 'off-field', 'drama', 'really', 'need', 'critique', 'anything', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'film', 'quite', 'simply', 'earned', 'right', 'do', 'whatever', 'play', 'cranky', 'old', 'baseball', 'scout', 'losing', 'sight', 'should', 'indulge', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'easily', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'watch', 'masters', 'part', 'best', 'ability', 'unfortunately', 'thrust', 'love', 'story', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'place', 'unnecessary', 'film', 'not', 'say', 'Timberlake', 'bad', 'role', 'surprisingly', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'decent', 'actor', 'are', 'already', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'variables', 'deal', 'forced/rushed', 'love', 'story', 'complicating', 'already', 'slow-moving', 'story', 'namely', 'stress', 'father/daughter', 'relationship.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'sports', 'films', 'highly', 'doubtful', 'will', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'breaking', 'top', 'twenty', 'certainly', 'no', 'Moneyball', 'even', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'caliber', 'experience', 'more', 'Sandlot', 'type', 'film', 'only', 'baseball', 'backdrop', 'further', 'predictable', 'lackluster', 'plot', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'football', 'basketball', 'film', 'Very', 'easily', 'studio', 'should', 'be', 'advised', 'encouraged', 'change', 'name', 'film', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'Trouble', 'Plot', 'Just', 'saying.Overall', 'anyone', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'will', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'still', 'master', 'craft', 'will', 'be', 'sad', 'day', 'when', 'call', 'long-lived', 'acting', 'career', 'Let', 'hope', 'directors', 'chair', 'though', 'event', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'look', 'visually', 'Instead', 'audiences', 'are', 'forced', 'look', 'high', 'school', 'baseball', 'stadium', 'backdrop', 'majority', 'film', 'giving', ""'cheat"", 'seats', 'quality', 'feeling', 'film', 'had', 'such', 'high', 'potential', 'felt', 'too', 'busy', 'drawn', 'out', 'not', 'mention', 'sappy', 'bland', 'Aside', 'acting', 'really', 'did', 'provide', 'high', 'amount', 'disappointment.Friday', 'Night', 'Date', 'Night', 'ReviewFollow', 'Facebook.com/FNDNReview']",Trouble with the Curve

1591167,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B009AMAK54,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Whereas MONEYBALL makes a case for the cold hard stats of sabermetrics, THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE celebrates the gut instinct and the long years of experience of the baseball scout. In the realm of America's national pastime, old Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) roams, a dinosaur in the era of the tech-savvy armchair pundit. Gus is a veteran baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. In the twilight of his career, his eyes are steadily failing him. It's not fully incapacitated him yet, but he's steady tripping over stuff now. His contract is up in three months. He gets wind that management is set to put him out to pasture. Gus, that stubborn, snarling mule, is just ornery enough to prove them wrong.Mickey (Amy Adams) is Gus's estranged 33-year-old daughter, an ambitious attorney on the cusp of being made partner. She's named after her dad's favorite baseball player. When an old family friend approaches her to relate her father's faltering vision, she's guilted into coming along Gus's latest scouting foray, never mind that Gus is fiercely against her tagging along. That tender father-daughter intimacy thing just ain't his bag.I could've sworn GRAN TORINO was the last bow, and that Eastwood was forever done with the acting side of the industry. But acting's an itch, isn't it? You can say that THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE is a bit obvious, and there's no arguing from me. You can say it's too leisurely paced, but that's what you get with character studies. The film works hard to get into the skins of its characters, is diligent with examining the two leads' foibles and quirks and a slew of neuroses that runs bone deep. It peels back layers. There are tiny details and pieces of memory that unfold gradually, the blend and sum of which explain away that monumental rift between Gus and Mickey. Gus is such a defensive, self-reliant old cuss. It literally pains him to have to depend on someone. You never question his daughter's committment to set things right. After all, this is Amy Adams playing the role, and Amy Adams exudes sunshine and light. The question always was will Gus learn to bend and meet her halfway. He's never had before.I'm still not sold on Justin Timberlake as an actor. In each film I'd seen him in before, he seemed to be always ""on."" That feeling doesn't evaporate with his performance here, but he's likable as the once promising pitcher ('til he wrecked his arm) and now fledgling scout for the Red Sox. He strikes an easy familiarity with Eastwood and is off-the-cuff charming with Adams. Timberlake presents the film's secondary and tertiary plotlines. Not only is he Mickey's potential love interest, he and Gus are vying for the same high school power hitter. More instrumental is that he provides the bridge between Gus and Mickey. Who would've thunk it that JT could pull off a part that's funny and diplomatic and wise? But his clogging is horrible.THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE works too hard for the perfect conclusion, except by that time I am so invested in the characters and their interactions that damn if I didn't lap it all up, all the convenient but very satisfying endings (Take that, Matthew Lillard!). The narrative won't ambush you with crazy plot twists. The conflicts are ones that play out a lot in typical familial relationship dramas. But Eastwood and Adams' nuanced performances glue you to where you'd parked your butt. I enjoyed THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE, but for Eastwood, GRAN TORINO is the better film to go out on. This is a good thing.

Gus's job is to scout a highly touted top high school baseball prospect and decide whether ""Bo"" should be the Braves number one pick in the upcoming draft. It readily becomes apparent that Gus' failing vision puts him at a distinct disadvantage of evaluating Bo, so daughter Mickey steps in to be her father's failing eyes. In the process, she tries to reconnect with her father and figure out why he seemed to reject her and ignore her after the death of her mother when she was just 6 years old. She also rediscovers her true love of baseball, and learns from her father the intricacies on how to scout players, from the flow of their swings to the sound of the fastball hitting a mitt. Intermixed into the relationship is Johnny Flanagan, (Justin Timberlake), a rival scout who takes a definite love interest in Gus's daughter, Mickey.Although the movie stars Clint Eastwood, clearly, this is Amy Adams' movie. She absolutely shines in her role of ""Mickey"" (named after Gus's favorite Yankee player), and she single-handedly rescues this film from being a mediocre film about an aging old man, to a very relevant film on how a father and daughter reconcile their past hurts and differences. To his credit, Eastwood knows to step back from the limelight and let Adam's star shine. While baseball plays a major role as the backdrop of this movie, it is the troubled parent-child relationship that is the core of this film. Amy Adams is nothing but terrific and her performance may very well be Oscar-worthy. Justin Timberlake, as Johnny, is also remarkably well cast as Mickey's love interest. I thought Timberlake could only sing; but his acting performance is more than adequate, and his relationship with the emotionally confused and tentative Mickey carries this movie forward in a huge way. A strong supporting cast, namely John Goodman, shores up this movie as well.The ending is particularly satisfying, and while all the questions about the troubled relationship between parent and child are never fully answered, clearly, the relationship is healed, and there is a promising future for both Gus, Mickey, and Johnny.I hope this is not Eastwood's last film performance. He has some emotionally engaging scenes where he really shows his range as an actor. He has so much more to give yet to the film industry. I hope he finds another role that allows his diverse talents to shine.While probably not generally appealing to the crucial 16-24 age group, (thus not a box office smash hit), I believe many ""Baby Boomers"" will appreciate this movie, not only for the portrayal of the angrily aging parent, but for the reconciliation that is possible in all relationships.(Rated PG-13 for language).kone",4,"Amy Adams Earns a Big ""Save"" in ""Trouble With the Curve""",1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,3504,"['2012', 'offering', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'return', 'big', 'screen', 'blockbuster', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Eastwood', 'Gus', 'Lobel', 'ancient', 'ailing', 'baseball', 'scout', 'Atlanta', 'Braves', 'who', 'perhaps', 'embarking', 'last', 'scouting', 'road', 'trip', 'younger', 'Braves', 'management', 'beginning', 'see', 'anachronism', 'rather', 'asset', 'Fortunately', 'scouting', 'boss', 'be', 'good', 'friend', 'supporter', 'Pete', 'played', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'Gus', 'having', 'physical', 'problems', 'Pete', 'up', 'Gus', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Mickey', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'aspiring', 'corporate', 'lawyer', 'go', 'father', 'last', 'road', 'trip', 'Being', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'Gus', 'intrusion', 'daughter', 'job', 'anger', 'subsides', 'stubbornly', 'side', 'Gus', 'job', 'scout', 'highly', 'touted', 'top', 'high', 'school', 'baseball', 'prospect', 'decide', 'Bo', 'should', 'be', 'Braves', 'number', 'one', 'pick', 'upcoming', 'draft', 'readily', 'apparent', 'Gus', 'failing', 'vision', 'distinct', 'disadvantage', 'evaluating', 'Bo', 'so', 'daughter', 'Mickey', 'steps', 'be', 'father', 'failing', 'eyes', 'process', 'reconnect', 'father', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'seemed', 'reject', 'ignore', 'death', 'mother', 'when', 'was', 'just', '6', 'years', 'old', 'also', 'true', 'love', 'baseball', 'father', 'intricacies', 'how', 'scout', 'players', 'flow', 'swings', 'sound', 'fastball', 'hitting', 'mitt', 'Intermixed', 'relationship', 'Johnny', 'Flanagan', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'rival', 'scout', 'who', 'definite', 'love', 'interest', 'Gus', 'daughter', 'Mickey.Although', 'movie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'clearly', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'role', 'Mickey', 'named', 'Gus', 'favorite', 'Yankee', 'player', 'single-handedly', 'film', 'being', 'mediocre', 'film', 'aging', 'old', 'man', 'very', 'relevant', 'film', 'how', 'father', 'daughter', 'reconcile', 'past', 'hurts', 'differences', 'credit', 'Eastwood', 'step', 'back', 'limelight', 'let', 'Adam', 'star', 'shine', 'baseball', 'major', 'role', 'backdrop', 'movie', 'troubled', 'parent-child', 'relationship', 'core', 'film', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'nothing', 'terrific', 'performance', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'Oscar-worthy', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Johnny', 'also', 'remarkably', 'well', 'cast', 'Mickey', 'love', 'interest', 'thought', 'Timberlake', 'could', 'only', 'sing', 'acting', 'performance', 'more', 'adequate', 'relationship', 'emotionally', 'confused', 'tentative', 'Mickey', 'movie', 'forward', 'huge', 'way', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'namely', 'John', 'Goodman', 'up', 'movie', 'well.The', 'ending', 'particularly', 'satisfying', 'questions', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'parent', 'child', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'answered', 'clearly', 'relationship', 'healed', 'promising', 'future', 'Gus', 'Mickey', 'Johnny.I', 'hope', 'not', 'Eastwood', 'last', 'film', 'performance', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'scenes', 'where', 'really', 'range', 'actor', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'give', 'yet', 'film', 'industry', 'hope', 'role', 'diverse', 'talents', 'shine.While', 'probably', 'not', 'generally', 'appealing', 'crucial', '16-24', 'age', 'group', 'thus', 'not', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'hit', 'believe', 'many', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'portrayal', 'angrily', 'aging', 'parent', 'reconciliation', 'possible', 'relationships', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'language', '.kone']",Trouble with the Curve

So it follows I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Clint is a baseball scout in this movie who is near the end of his contract.The owner of the team is concerned about Clint's ability to continue scouting because of his age.  He has a critic, in the team's front office, that claims Clint can't do a good job because he doesn't know modern methods of scouting like using computers and statistics to verify a player's potential value to the team. He also has a front office supporter, played by John Goodman, that reminds the owner of the all-star players and MVPs that Clint has found for the team.  The owner isn't sure what is his best option.  Goodman takes responsibility for sending Eastwood to scout baseball's hottest prospect.John visits Clint to fill him in on what's at stake and observes that Clint is having problems with his sight (macular degeneration)and a rather foul attitude in general. John becomes concerned about Clint's trip to scout the nation's hottest baseball prospect.  Back in the office John calls Clint's daughter, who is a lawyer and estranged from Clint.  He tells her that he believes it would be good for her to join Clint on the trip.She says no.  She won't do it.  However certain events cause her to change her mind and she goes.The movie has several subplots.  Clint and the daughter reestablishing their relationship.  The daughter and a young rival baseball scout falling in love.  Clint recognizing that the hot power-hitting prospect has &#34;trouble with the curve&#34;.  The daughter discovering a pitching prospect that no other team was scouting.I rated the movie five stars because it is a feel good movie and Clint's antics are great comedy.The movie's premise that no other team's scouts would not be aware that a certain power hitter couldn't hit a breaking ball except this one crusty old scout is I think not realistic.

In this film Clint Eastwood plays the role of an aging baseball scout. He has been doing it for years and he is very good at what he does. But like all of us he is aging; his eyes are not what they use to be. He compensates by using his hearing like people who are vision impaired do. His character's name is Gus Lobel and Gus can tell a pitch just by the crack of the bat. Thus he refuses to be benched for what may be his final season in his outstanding baseball-scouting career. But Gus may not have a choice. The front office of the Atlanta Braves is starting to question his judgment, especially with the country's hottest batting phenomenon on deck for the draft. Gus needs help to prove that all is not what it seems and the one person who might be able to help him is his daughter. But she is the one person Gus would never ask. His daughter Mickey is played by Amy Adams and plays the role of an associate at a high-powered Atlanta law firm whose drive and ambition has put her on the fast track to becoming partner. So against her better judgment, and over Gus's objections, Mickey joins him on his latest scouting trip to North Carolina, jeopardizing her own career to save his. This is a heartwarming story of what true families do when trouble shows its ugly head. Yes, they all pitch in to resolve the problem. So can Mickey help Gus? Will this film have a happy ending? Will Gus stick by his guns? You have to see it to find out! The title &#34;Trouble with the Curve&#34; makes for a really great movie!

1591258,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009AMAK54,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Can Clint Eastwood actually make a bad movie? I'm beginning to think it's impossible. I went back to check out the list of movies he's starred in over the past several decades and while I found one or two that weren't my taste and maybe one other that was just different I couldn't actually find one I would say was terrible. Remarkably at 82 his record remains intact with the new release TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE.Here Eastwood plays Gus, a baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. Gus is getting older and beginning to have problems with his eyesight, something he needs to do his job. The franchise is looking for smarter ways to decide who to sign and Gus is in competition with Phillip (Matthew Lillard) and his computer stats style of knowing which players to sign.Running along side this story is that of Gus' daughter Mickey (Amy Adams), a top notch lawyer who is on the fast track to partnership. If Mickey can win the latest case she's in charge of then she's almost guaranteed a partnership at the firm. But things with Gus will find these two crossing paths that are not well traveled between father and daughter.The two have issues with one another that stem back from years before. When Gus' friend Pete (John Goodman) begins to think Gus might have a problem, he calls on Mickey to help him out and to make sure Gus is all right. While Gus doesn't want this so called babysitter with him on his latest trip to scout out a hot prospect, Mickey goes anyway hoping that perhaps she can get some answers to the questions she's had most of her life about her father.Eastwood's Gus is a cantankerous sort who is unwilling to admit that there is something wrong. He does have the occasional moment when he lets down his guard to his daughter but he's determined to be on his own and do things his way like he always has. Adam's Mickey is just as stubborn as her father and attempts to give him plenty of opportunities to open up but those moments don't seem to be happening. How they resolve these problems that have developed over years on a three day road trip makes for interesting viewing and touches the heart as well.Included in this mix is Justin Timberlake as Johnny, an ex-ball player that Gus signed up years before but whose career has changed over the years. Having thrown out his arm, he's now a talent scout as well. He still gets along great with Gus and as the days go by begins to develop some feelings for Mickey as well.While the movie is centered around the world of baseball make no mistake, it's not baseball that is the film's focus. This film is about the lives of two people who should be connected from the start but whose lives have taken them down different paths away from one another. While they both should find comfort and ease with one another their lives offer little of either. It is this path that they've gone down for years that has driven them apart and has left them with emotional scars that they won't easily repair.There isn't a bad piece of acting in this entire film. Adams does a great job as Mickey, trying to solve the problems that she's built up over the years. Timberlake has grown on me over the past few years showing that he can be a dynamite actor given the chance. The surprising thing for me in this film was Eastwood though. Always teased about a monotone delivery and for his use of silence more than speaking, the character of Gus is given plenty of life in Eastwood's performance here. One sequence involving him visiting his wife's grave was particularly touching and totally different than anything I've ever seen him do before.When this film came out I wasn't sure that I actually wanted to see it. I held off on it even when it came out on DVD but thought finally why not. I'm glad I did. This was one of the most enjoyable dramas I've seen in some time. It also proves that while Eastwood is getting older, he's also still one of the best movie stars around today.",4,OUR HEROES GROW OLD,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,3934,"['Can', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'actually', 'make', 'bad', 'movie', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'think', 'impossible', 'went', 'back', 'check', 'out', 'list', 'movies', 'starred', 'past', 'several', 'decades', 'found', 'one', 'two', 'were', ""n't"", 'taste', 'maybe', 'one', 'other', 'was', 'just', 'different', 'could', ""n't"", 'actually', 'find', 'one', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'terrible', 'Remarkably', '82', 'record', 'intact', 'new', 'release', 'TROUBLE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'CURVE.Here', 'Eastwood', 'Gus', 'baseball', 'scout', 'Atlanta', 'Braves', 'Gus', 'getting', 'older', 'beginning', 'have', 'problems', 'eyesight', 'something', 'do', 'job', 'franchise', 'looking', 'smarter', 'ways', 'decide', 'who', 'sign', 'Gus', 'competition', 'Phillip', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'computer', 'style', 'knowing', 'players', 'sign.Running', 'along', 'side', 'story', 'Gus', 'daughter', 'Mickey', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'top', 'notch', 'lawyer', 'who', 'fast', 'track', 'partnership', 'Mickey', 'can', 'win', 'latest', 'case', 'charge', 'then', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'partnership', 'firm', 'things', 'Gus', 'will', 'find', 'two', 'crossing', 'paths', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'traveled', 'father', 'daughter.The', 'two', 'have', 'issues', 'one', 'stem', 'back', 'years', 'before', 'When', 'Gus', 'friend', 'Pete', 'John', 'Goodman', 'think', 'Gus', 'might', 'have', 'problem', 'Mickey', 'help', 'out', 'make', 'sure', 'Gus', 'right', 'Gus', ""n't"", 'want', 'so', 'called', 'babysitter', 'latest', 'trip', 'scout', 'out', 'hot', 'prospect', 'Mickey', 'anyway', 'hoping', 'perhaps', 'can', 'get', 'answers', 'questions', 'had', 'most', 'life', 'father.Eastwood', 'Gus', 'cantankerous', 'sort', 'who', 'unwilling', 'admit', 'something', 'wrong', 'have', 'occasional', 'moment', 'when', 'down', 'guard', 'daughter', 'determined', 'be', 'own', 'do', 'things', 'way', 'always', 'Adam', 'Mickey', 'just', 'as', 'stubborn', 'father', 'attempts', 'give', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'open', 'up', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'happening', 'How', 'resolve', 'problems', 'have', 'developed', 'over', 'years', 'three', 'day', 'road', 'trip', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'heart', 'well.Included', 'mix', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Johnny', 'ex-ball', 'player', 'Gus', 'signed', 'up', 'years', 'career', 'changed', 'years', 'Having', 'thrown', 'out', 'arm', 'now', 'talent', 'scout', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'along', 'great', 'Gus', 'days', 'go', 'begins', 'develop', 'feelings', 'Mickey', 'movie', 'centered', 'world', 'baseball', 'make', 'mistake', 'not', 'baseball', 'film', 'focus', 'film', 'lives', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'connected', 'start', 'lives', 'have', 'taken', 'down', 'different', 'paths', 'away', 'one', 'should', 'find', 'comfort', 'ease', 'one', 'lives', 'offer', 'little', 'path', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'down', 'years', 'driven', 'apart', 'left', 'emotional', 'scars', 'wo', ""n't"", 'easily', 'repair.There', ""n't"", 'bad', 'piece', 'acting', 'entire', 'film', 'Adams', 'great', 'job', 'Mickey', 'trying', 'solve', 'problems', 'built', 'up', 'years', 'Timberlake', 'grown', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'showing', 'can', 'be', 'dynamite', 'actor', 'given', 'chance', 'surprising', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'Eastwood', 'Always', 'teased', 'monotone', 'delivery', 'use', 'silence', 'more', 'speaking', 'character', 'Gus', 'given', 'plenty', 'life', 'Eastwood', 'performance', 'here', 'One', 'sequence', 'involving', 'visiting', 'wife', 'grave', 'was', 'particularly', 'touching', 'totally', 'different', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', 'before.When', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'actually', 'wanted', 'see', 'held', 'off', 'even', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'thought', 'finally', 'why', 'not', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'also', 'Eastwood', 'getting', 'older', 'also', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'today']",Trouble with the Curve

One of the beauties of this film is how it crosses over baseball subculture with relationships of all types. Clint Eastwood plays a grumpy old timer baseball scout whose vision is going out and Amy Adams plays his lawyer-daughter trying to make partner (dependent on a big case) yet she gets called to assist her father's scouting because a friend (played by John Goodman) asks her to do it and she's scared for her father's health. Enter the standard work with your relationships from the old American perspective but the conflicts and layers are so much more.As one might expect the father and daughter have a troublesome relationship that became scarred when the father ""abandoned"" her, sending her off to stay with an uncle and aunt. As a result the daughter has obvious intimacy issues and fear of abandonment which make her troublesome in any intimate relationship. The whole thematic focus as a result is about this relationship while baseball further symbolizes and layers the issue. Compare players who are not quite up to the Major Leagues because they have one serious issue holding them back much like people who cannot function in an intimate relationship.Justin Timberlake plays the romantic interest to Amy Smart. He's a washed out pitcher who is trying to make a life as a baseball scout and stay in the game. Timberlake is one of the lead romantic male choices in the last few years and as expected he delivers. His lines and mannerisms are great for bringing down the walls of the Adams character.Overall, I'd describe this as one of those slice of life family pictures about people you can like. Baseball fans will appreciate the details, too.Also starring Robert Patrick as Eastwood's boss in the film.Eastwood claimed he was retired from acting but the 82 year old actor liked the script enough to get in front of the camera again.The budget for this film is not listed but it has made over $35M at the Box Office so far.SOUND/MUSIC: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus to A minus; BASEBALL FOCUSES/SOMETHING FRESH (by Hollywood standards): B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid January 2013.",4,MY GRADE: B plus to A minus.,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,2287,"[""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'baseball', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'picture', 'immensely', 'One', 'beauties', 'film', 'how', 'baseball', 'subculture', 'relationships', 'types', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'grumpy', 'old', 'timer', 'baseball', 'scout', 'vision', 'going', 'out', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'lawyer-daughter', 'trying', 'make', 'partner', 'dependent', 'big', 'case', 'yet', 'called', 'assist', 'father', 'scouting', 'friend', 'played', 'John', 'Goodman', 'do', 'scared', 'father', 'health', 'Enter', 'standard', 'work', 'relationships', 'old', 'American', 'perspective', 'conflicts', 'layers', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more.As', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'father', 'daughter', 'have', 'troublesome', 'relationship', 'became', 'scarred', 'when', 'father', 'abandoned', 'sending', 'off', 'stay', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'result', 'daughter', 'obvious', 'intimacy', 'issues', 'fear', 'abandonment', 'make', 'troublesome', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'whole', 'thematic', 'focus', 'result', 'relationship', 'baseball', 'further', 'symbolizes', 'issue', 'Compare', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'Major', 'Leagues', 'have', 'one', 'serious', 'issue', 'holding', 'back', 'much', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'function', 'intimate', 'relationship.Justin', 'Timberlake', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'washed', 'out', 'pitcher', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'baseball', 'scout', 'stay', 'game', 'Timberlake', 'one', 'lead', 'romantic', 'male', 'choices', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'as', 'expected', 'lines', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'great', 'bringing', 'down', 'walls', 'Adams', 'character.Overall', ""'d"", 'describe', 'one', 'slice', 'life', 'family', 'people', 'can', 'like', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'details', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Eastwood', 'boss', 'film.Eastwood', 'claimed', 'was', 'retired', 'acting', '82', 'year', 'old', 'actor', 'liked', 'script', 'enough', 'get', 'front', 'camera', 'again.The', 'budget', 'film', 'not', 'listed', 'made', '35M', 'Box', 'Office', 'so', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE', 'B', 'STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'BASEBALL', 'FOCUSES/SOMETHING', 'FRESH', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'B', 'B', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'WHEN', 'WATCHED', 'mid', 'January', '2013']",Trouble with the Curve

As his contract is up for renewal, he faces the usual effects of getting older, but his deteriorating vision could jeopardize his career.In a by-the-numbers story, Gus (Eastwood) has a successful daughter (Amy Adams) who is on the cusp of making partner in a high profile law firm.  Gus and Mickey's (Adams) relationship is strained to say the least.  Mickey's mom died when she was about 6 so dad was responsible for her care.  Rather than spend time with her, he pawned her off on relatives most of the time.  We keep waiting for the real reason which eventually comes with a thud.Gus is sent to North Carolina to scout a highly prized slugger in high school.  When Mickey learns of her dad's eyesight problem, she meets him.  He's not happy of course, grumbling all the while.  Why?  It is here Justin Timberlake is introduced as a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Gus who blew out his arm.  He's now a scout for the Red Sox as well as a potential love interest for Mickey and some comic relief.  This movie signals where it's going more often than a third base coach.It also adds the traditional Hollywood treatment of secondary characters.  The high school star is a real dick; cocky, arrogant and just unlikeable.  So we are set up for movie revenge.  Likewise, Gus has to deal with an assertive executive (Matthew Lillard) who wants Gus out of the organization.  He's also portrayed as a real jerk, just so we can smile when he gets his due.This movie is certainly the other side of 2011's ""Moneyball"" where technology and statistics are the winning formula.  ""Trouble with the Curve's"" plot line relies on Gus's ability to calculate a player's potential by the sound of the bat.  I'll take ""Moneyball"" both as a movie and a strategy to find good players.Well, there is certainly no trouble with the Blu ray transfer.  Delivered in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the picture is clear and crisp.  Every Eastwood wrinkle is there.  The colors are excellent as are the black levels.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option is likewise excellent.  Nothing in particular stands out, but the crowd ambiance and the dialog are clear.

Well, this star's latest comeback in the role of an aging baseball scout is a comeback to remember.  And while Clint Eastwood does just fine being Clint Eastwood, he'd be nowhere without the rest of this fine cast.  Amy Adams is always worth watching and her tom-boyish streak was a perfect touch.  I could never get enough of John Goodman and the man delivers here as a good friend and fair boss to Eastwood's character.  Matthew Lillard was perfectly slimey and Robert Patrick was great about seeming competent while missing something obvious...mainly Eastwood's skills as an actor and his characters knowledge of the American pasttime.  I'll be honest here...I want to like Justin Timberlake...I really do.  I'm just having trouble with his transition from boy band singer to serious actor.  But if Mr. Timberlake turns out more performances even half as good as this one, he'll win me over for sure.  Of course, no great cast is without a great story to work with and this film delivers on that just fine.  I do find the ending a bit too neat and perhaps corny, especially as it all depended on a number of pretty amazing coincidences and some serious luck.  But maybe this is just part of the film's charm...after all, some of our great historical moments are born out of coincidences and luck.  I'll admit I enjoyed the desperation exhibited by Robert Patrick's character when he was trying to get Clint Eastwood's character to renew his contract with the team, ready to offer him anything he wanted, and Mr. Eastwood wasn't in any hurry.  And sometimes, we just need an ending like this.  It's certainly no Disney fairytale (imagine Clint in one of those) but that doesn't mean a happy ending isn't out of the relm of possibilities.

John Goodman plays Gus's (Eastwood) boss,  and Justin Timberlake plays an injured baseball player turned scout.Gus is losing his sight, which is his mainstay in his business. Mickey, his estranged daughter is called about Gus's problems by Goodman's character. She is betwixt and between, she is on the edge of a big business promotion, but she decides to pay her father a visit. They quarrel, but she perseveres and helps dad with his scouting. They concentrate on Bo Gentry, an obnoxious country boy who thinks he is hot stuff. Gus does not like Gentry, he can hear the whistle of the ball when it slides by Gentry and knows he can't hit all the balls. Timberlake's character is not so certain. Timberlake and Mickey meet and carry on in a grown- up manner and their repertoire is entertainng. The final day when Gus must give his appraisal of Bo Gentry is the complete opposite of the computer generated models. Will Gus's decision be his last? Will Mickey and the scout hook up? Wil Bo Gentry meet his comeuppance?Stay tuned, the last scenes are worth the price.Recommended. prisrob 01-02-13Leap YearThe Big Uneasy",4,"Hey, Peanut Boy!",1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1343,"['liked', 'film', 'liked', 'story', 'line', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'OK', 'hill', 'father', 'baseball', 'scout', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'daughter', 'smart', 'savvy', 'lawyer', 'entire', 'life', 'job', 'somewhat', 'father', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Gus', 'Eastwood', 'boss', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'injured', 'baseball', 'player', 'turned', 'scout.Gus', 'losing', 'sight', 'mainstay', 'business', 'Mickey', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'called', 'Gus', 'problems', 'Goodman', 'character', 'betwixt', 'edge', 'big', 'business', 'promotion', 'pay', 'father', 'visit', 'quarrel', 'dad', 'scouting', 'concentrate', 'Bo', 'Gentry', 'obnoxious', 'country', 'boy', 'who', 'hot', 'stuff', 'Gus', 'not', 'like', 'Gentry', 'can', 'hear', 'whistle', 'ball', 'when', 'Gentry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'balls', 'Timberlake', 'character', 'not', 'so', 'certain', 'Timberlake', 'Mickey', 'meet', 'carry', 'grown-', 'up', 'manner', 'repertoire', 'entertainng', 'final', 'day', 'when', 'Gus', 'must', 'give', 'appraisal', 'Bo', 'Gentry', 'complete', 'opposite', 'computer', 'generated', 'models', 'Will', 'Gus', 'decision', 'be', 'last', 'Will', 'Mickey', 'scout', 'hook', 'up', 'Wil', 'Bo', 'Gentry', 'meet', 'comeuppance', 'Stay', 'tuned', 'last', 'scenes', 'are', 'price.Recommended', 'prisrob', '01-02-13Leap', 'YearThe', 'Big', 'Uneasy']",Trouble with the Curve

This movie is about a man named Gus who is a baseball talent scout but he is losing his sight. He is old-fashioned and always relied on his sight and a feeling to pick good baseball players. Without his sight he doesn't know how to scout and even though he is having trouble he won't ask for help. His daughter comes to help him anyway and they have a good time together but bad things happen too. The main characters in the movie are Gus and Mickey. Gus is played by Clint Eastwood and Mickey is played by Amy Adams. Amy Adams is in another movie that my little sister loves called Enchanted and I also really liked her in The Muppets. My favorite character in this movie is Gus because he is a good man that people should trust. He knows a LOT about baseball and has a good heart. The movie also has really good chemistry. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams work very well together. He kind of seems like a grumpy old man and she is kind of sweet.My favorite part in this movie is when Mickey meets a new guy who can through a really good curve ball and since she really loves baseball they become really good friends. I would recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because my brother says that the movie was a little too old for him and he's seven.

This time, Eastwood's character is the symbolic representation of the dated, but perhaps purer, world of baseball before the computer analysts arrived with their statistical analyses of a game that the movie argues, both metaphorically and literally, should be assessed by those who have experience and an indefinable human approach.  It is therefore an undisguised attack on ""Moneyball."" But this challenge is filled with more bluster than substance, as is the rest of the movie. In its unsophisticated, transparent attempts to make the audience smile, it lacks depth, development and realism.Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, a veteran Atlanta Braves baseball scout whose traditional methods are not only questioned by a few of the upstart, obnoxious members in the front office- especially ambitious executive Phillip Sanderson (Matthew Lillard)- but whose eyesight is failing as well. (Ah, but he is still able to detect the ability of a hitter by the sound of his swing!!!) To help him defeat the villains who want him fired, his estranged daughter Mickey (Amy Adams)is coaxed by Pete Klein (John Goodman), Gus' best friend and immediate superior, into lending a hand. She has been waging a battle of her own combating the weary jabs of the chauvinist pigs at her law office, and when she is taken off an important case, she is ultimately convinced to dump her legal career in favor of becoming Gus' willing assistant. Their subsequent rapprochement is aided by Johnny Flanagan (Dustin Timberlake), a former promising pitcher originally scouted and signed by Gus, who is now a rival scout for the Boston Red Sox.  Johnny runs into the pair when they're all in North Carolina to check out a young batting phenom, potentially number one draft-pick, Bo Gentry.  What then occurs is so evident that you needn't wonder how the story will turn out.This over-simplified morality tale of right vs. wrong is objectionable enough (the only thing missing is black and white hats to tell the good guys from the bad), but becomes all the more ridiculous in the scenes which focus on baseball itself.  Indeed, in its ostensible effort to defend the game's honored traditions, the film commits repeated blunders, revealing a fundamental ignorance and misunderstanding of the game that even a casual fan will notice.These and additional problems notwithstanding, at least Amy Adamsonce again demonstrates her talent and versatility. The script didn't give her much to work with, but her performance is easily the best thing in the movie. Goodman does what we now have come to expect, a journeyman-like job in his supporting role; and for his part, Justin Timberlake does not embarrass himself. How often, however, will Eastwood continue to play the same tired character? We've seen this old grouch with the heart of gold in ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino."" He doesn't even have to read the screenplay - just show up and ad lib. Regrettably, that's what it appears he did here, and his work falls far short of what we witnessed in those other two superior efforts.Maudlin, clich&eacute;d, formulaic and loaded with out-of-date stereotypes, ""Trouble with the Curve"" is neither a good baseball movie nor even a good film.

1591400,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B009AMAK54,Steven Aldersley,"[4, 6]","I knew that I wanted to see Trouble with the Curve without knowing anything about the plot. The reason? Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams are so likable. Eastwood claimed that he would never act again after making Gran Torino, but I'm happy that he changed his mind. Eastwood plays baseball scout, Gus Lobel, and his character is similar to Walt from Gran Torino in many ways. He's hard to get along with, even if you happen to be one of his close friends.One thing I should point out is that Trouble of the Curve is funny. Although it's tagged as a drama, there is a lot of humor in the movie. Eastwood has good comic timing and his character delivers one-liners at every opportunity. The audience in my theater laughed loudly and often. But the story also has the ability to move you emotionally. It feels somewhat like a James L. Brooks movie, such as Broadcast News or As Good as It Gets.Like Moneyball, Trouble with the Curve is about people more than it is about Baseball. Gus has three months left on his contract and with the exception of his friend, Paul (John Goodman), people are starting to wonder whether he's still capable of doing his job. He's a dinosaur, preferring to dig through a pile of newspapers for statistics, rather than rely on computers for the information. His boss (Matthew Lillard) wants to replace him.The thing is, there is some truth to the belief that Gus is struggling to do his job as a scout. His eyesight is failing and it doesn't go unnoticed. Paul pays him a visit and advises him of the situation, asking him if he has considered the future, but Gus won't listen. In desperation, Paul asks Gus's daughter, Mickey (Adams), to go on the road and help out her father with his latest scouting assignment. She's an ambitious lawyer, and on the verge of becoming a partner, but she agrees to squeeze it into her schedule and intervene.Adams is a talented actress and I've been waiting for her to get a meaty role after earning an Oscar nomination for her performance in Doubt. Her role in The Fighter was too brief to count. I've yet to see The Master, but I came away thinking this was the best Amy Adams performance in the past four years. I mentioned that she is likable, but she's also good at what she does. There's a certain intelligence and vulnerability to her characters that I find appealing, and it's present in Mickey. She appears successful on the outside, but she has never been close to her father.There are three main themes present in the movie:If you have seen Absolute Power, you'll know that Eastwood is convincing as a father who has a problematic relationship with his daughter. One of the keys to Trouble with the Curve is seeing how Mickey attempts to resolve her issues with Gus.The most obvious issue is with Gus, as old age threatens his livelihood. Director Robert Lorenz takes plenty of time at the outset to establish his characters, allowing us to get an idea of what is at stake. Is Gus washed up, or does he still have something to offer? I won't ruin that for you.The other main theme is the ability to decide what constitutes happiness. It's different for everyone. Are you happy because you earn a good salary and thrive in your career? What about personal relationships and family? How about having time to enjoy your life?It's clear that Gus is happy working as a baseball scout, but what isn't clear is how Mickey views her own life. Is she truly happy as a lawyer? Can she come to terms with the distance between her and her father? She's also romantically involved with a man who thinks of her as a commodity rather than as a woman he loves. He figures that they get along quite well and are both successful, so it would make sense for them to be together. He's not the most romantic of men.That's the setup. As you can see, there are a lot of issues at stake.One thing the movie does badly is make it obvious which characters you are supposed to root for, and who you should dislike. That flaw makes it easy to predict the outcome for Gus, Mickey, and at least three other minor characters. Those flaws aside, I enjoyed the pacing and the thorough characterization.If this turns out to be Eastwood's final acting role, it's not a bad way to finish. As for Adams, it is good to see her in a role which allows her to show that she can actually act. I should also mention Justin Timberlake, who plays a former baseball player and young talent scout. He's also interested in Mickey if she'll let down her defenses long enough.Trouble with the Curve isn't a great movie, but it's very good, and one that I want to own. It's a pleasure to spend time with the actors and the story has a lot of warmth. If you're a fan of Eastwood or Adams, I doubt that you'll be disappointed.",4,Has a James L.

Swing and connected!Watching at liesure soon after with my wife within the first 20"" of this cinematic game I knew exactly how it was going to play out and I was grateful that I hadn't wasted any moolah on it.  Out at first!This film is pretty pedestrian; it goes by the numbers.  You have the story of a revered but aging out of the game scout (played by Clint Eastwood, all gruff and no substance) who is suffering an eye malady and who is never in the office to battle the young statistic crunchers who want to push him out of his job.  You have the story of his daughter (played by Amy Adams doing her best to raise the emotinal bar of this film but generally failing), physically and emotionally abandoned by her father, but still loyal to him and with a driving internal ache to still be daddy's little girl.  You have the romantic love interest (played by Justin Timberlake who isn't given much to do and does alright) who has a strong tie to the daughter's father and who could be easily manipulated to give them what they want...Okay I tried not to spoil anything but if you can't see where this is all going then maybe you'll dig on this movie like some other people have.  What was worse for me than the simple see-the-pitch coming storyline was how utterly one-note all of these characters were (and the ball player making a name for himself with his bat was simply the worst; it's as if the movie was sticking in a cue card that read ""DON'T LIKE THIS GUY, AUDIENCE!  HE'S A JERKWAD!"").  The performances (excepting John Goodman who offered empathy and vulnerability) were either dull (Adams), wooden (Eastwood, I know he was going for gruff but that was ridiculous), or stiff (all of the extras; and I mean all of them).  It makes me wonder if director Robert Lorenz knows what an emotion is outside of a high school play (yeah, yeah, I know I shouldn't knock high school plays...).Trouble With The Curve has trouble of its own finding nuanced emotional beats and avoiding heavy foreshadowing.  I can't help but believe that otherwise good actors were hampered by a faulty script and directing.

With a solid  cast (Amy Adams, Eastwood, Timberlake) this movie showed promise early on. Eastwood plays an aging baseball scout whose vision is deteriorating, and in the end, despite not being able to see players' mechanics clearly, he manages to use his wisdom, experience and 'hearing' to still be the best scout in the business. His daughter is an attorney who's so caught up in her work, that she forgot how to 'live'. A strained lifelong relationship with her father comes to a head when she accompanies him on a scouting trip to North Carolina. There, they clash, until her father finally tells her the reason why he wasn't in her life for many years. With his visual impairment affecting his evaluation of players, she takes over and ultimately finds a true gem of a pitcher who easily strikes out baseball's top prospect, with (you guessed it) the curve ball. It was this prospect that Eastwood said wasnt good enough for the Braves to draft, because he couldn't hit the curve, but they did so anyway. This movie has a nice touch to it, and carries a message of forgiveness and love.

You have a very difficult relationship and, at the same time, are coming to a turning point in your own career. What do you do tend to, your career or your family?Gus Lobel (played by Clint Eastwood) is a scout for the Atlanta Braves and has resisted the change occurring in his business and the world around him with every fiber of his being. While his immediate superior and longtime friend Pete (played by John Goodman) values Gus's opinion and defends him against his detractors, one of them is Pete's boss and Gus's ultimate superior. That man, Pete Silver (played by Matthew Lillard) is determined to fire Gus even though he is completely unaware of Gus's failing eyesight. To Silver, a man who relies on statistics and equations over experience and first-hand observation, Gus is a relic of a time gone by. Gus is given one chance, scouting a highly-coveted player in North Carolina, to prove his value to the organization. Pete worries about his friend and so, behind his back, he contacts Gus's daughter Mickey (played by Amy Adams). Mickey is a lawyer on a partnership track in a prestigious firm with a pressing case on the horizon. She's been told that her handling of this case will determine the outcome of the upcoming partnership vote. Still, despite a strained relationship between the two of them, she chooses to go to her father's aide in rural North Carolina and work in her hotel room and over the internet. When Gus informs Mickey that his eyes are starting to fail him, she begins taking an active role in her father's scouting trip. A task she is well-suited for, after a spending a large portion of her formative years by her father's side on scouting trips. In addition to colleagues Gus has known for many years, there is Johnny Flanagan, a relatively inexperienced scout who Gus recruited into the major leagues and who later suffered a career-ending injury. Johnny (played by Justin Timberlake) thinks of Gus as a mentor and, separately, takes an immediate romantic interest in Mickey.Now, many believed that 2008's Gran Torino would be the end of Eastwood's career, both as a director and an actor. Some who thought little of the film even took great joy in the very idea of Eastwood's retirement. I was not among them. I won't say this is better than Gran Torino or Million Dollar Baby, it isn't. Still, it's an enjoyable film about the endurance of family that also manages to incorporate some timeless wisdom regarding the quintessential American sport.

The film is directed by Eastwood's long-time collaborator (assistant director/producer) Robert Lorenz making his feature film debut here.Clint Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, whose latest (and possibly last) assignment is to travel to North Carolina and scout a promising high school player Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill). Being unsure of his ability to see whether Bo is really worth the No.1 pick, Gus's friend and boss Pete Klein (John Goodman) asks Gus's daughter Mickey to accompany her father, whose eyesight is failing.

1591455,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B009AMAK54,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[10, 18]","Trouble With The Curve is a watchable film about an aging baseball scout facing problems with a changing game, fading eyesight and a difficult relationship with his daughter that he's running out of time to fix. In a lot of ways, it could have been the perfect counter-point to last year's excellent film Moneyball, showing the view of the veteran scouts and their traditional ways of looking for talent in contrast to the analytics-driven approach which now dominates the game. But in the hands of first-time director Robert Lorenz and first-time screen-writer Randy Brown, Trouble With The Curve never ventures beyond formula and manages to run for 111 mostly by-the-numbers minutes without a single moment of unpredictability.Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is a man caught between the rocks of old age and failing eyesight and the hard place of trying to hang on to his job as a baseball scout as the whole nature of the business is changing around him, going from a hands-on gut feel approach to boiling down potential players into a set of stats on a laptop. His contract with the Atlanta Braves baseball team is coming up for renewal, but his bosses, team owner Vince (Robert Patrick) and manager Pete Klein (John Goodman) aren't sure if Gus is up to the job anymore. Especially with their up-and-coming scout Phil Sanderson (Matthew Lillard, oozing sleaze) telling them that Gus' way of doing things just doesn't cut it anymore.Ultimately, everything depends on a scouting mission Gus is set to handle: to check out a player named Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill, oozing obnoxiousness), a hard-hitter on a small Georgia college team who's viewed as a potential top pick in the upcoming draft. Klein, who's a long-time friend of Gus's as well as his boss, gets in touch with Gus's daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams, shining brilliantly) a successful attorney on the brink of being made a partner at the law firm where she works. Klein tells Mickey his concerns and what's at stake for Gus if he blows this mission, asking her to go with Gus and keep an eye on things. Unwilling at first, particularly as her being made a partner depends on a big presentation she's to give for a major client in a matter of days, Mickey reluctantly gives in when she finds out about Gus's eye problems, telling her bosses that she has to take a couple of days off to deal with her father but that she _will_ be there to handle the presentation on time. While Mickey and Gus aren't exactly estranged, there is nonetheless a distance between them that neither seems able to overcome, making their relationship difficult at best and more often one of walking away with hands thrown up in frustration. Their only common ground, rather naturally given the film, is their love of baseball.While scouting out the intended prospect, Gus and Mickey run into Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former pitcher first recruited by Gus who is now a scout for the Boston Red Sox, having been forced to find an alternate career after his arm gave out too soon. Johnny rounds out the odd trio, Johnny in his relationship to Gus as a former recruit and now rival scout, Gus with his awkward and ever frictional relationship with Mickey, and now Mickey who finds herself being drawn out in spite of herself by Johnny's almost clownish come-on's. And of course all three of them with their relationship with baseball, the one thing where they all find their moments of grace.It has to be said that if Trouble With The Curve works at all, it is in no small part because of Amy Adams' performance. In spite of Lorenz' mechanical direction and Brown's pedestrian script, Adams manages to make Mickey shine nonetheless, engaging you in ways that make you buy into her character even when you'd otherwise see no reason to. Some of her best moments are those in which she has no dialogue and it's just the expression on her face conveying what Mickey is feeling that make the connection. Her scenes with Eastwood and with Timberlake work because she makes them work, bringing a chemistry to the situations that keeps you watching and makes you care. Eastwood's Gus is adequate to the role, but only just, with Eastwood basically just playing the same role he's been playing for the last twenty years, largely glaring and growling his way through things, mostly relying in this case on the fact that at 82 he actually _is_ old instead of having to act old. In the hands of a better director, Eastwood would almost certainly have given a better performance, but one of the problems with Trouble With The Curve is that Lorenz doesn't seem to know how to draw the best out of his actors or the situations they're in. Timberlake is not only largely wasted but in retrospect grossly miscast: he would have been far more effective as Gus's in-house nemesis Sanderson. As Johnny, he really doesn't have much credibility or even reason to be there as you could pretty much cut all of his scenes and it wouldn't affect the main plot in the slightest. But at the same time, his scenes with Adams do give her even more opportunities to shine. One of my favorite scenes is in a country bar where Mickey pulls a reluctant Johnny out onto the dance floor for a throw-him-in-the-water lesson in clog-dancing.The other performances are a mixed bag, but two in particular stand out in ways that encapsulate the problems with the script and the direction. Matthew Lillard's Phil is almost a caricature of a sleazey underhanded in-house rival to Gus, so over-the-top that you know from the moment he first opens his mouth that you're supposed to hate him. I think this could be something of a career problem for Lillard as he's gone from always playing goofy comic sidekicks when he was younger to now playing complete sleazeballs in recent years, most recently in The Descendants. And Joe Massingill's Bo Gentry is so unbelievably obnoxious that it's a mystery why the rest of his team hasn't taken him out behind the stadium and beaten him to death with his own bat long before Gus and Mickey show up. If Trouble With The Curve had been an outright comedy, then both Lillard and Massingill's performances would've fit perfectly, but as it is, some subtlety was badly needed and unfortunately was completely lacking, the primary blame for which must be laid at the feet of Lorenz and Brown.One wishes that Lorenz and Brown had been more daring or ambitious, given the talented actors they had to work with, but they weren't. You can tell early on that before Trouble With The Curve is over, all problems will be resolved in true Hollywood fashion, the characters you like will all triumph in the end and the characters you dislike will all get their deserved comeuppance. One also wishes that they'd gotten a more experienced director and writer to begin with as quite frankly Lorenz and Brown display a lack of talent in both the direction and the writing. The one element of mystery in the film - the reason why Gus and Mickey have such distance between them - when finally revealed feels completely artificial due in part to the clunky way in which the foreshadowing was handled and in part to the fact that, once revealed, it apparently makes no difference to either character as the movie just returns to its original track. The editing is often jumpy in places instead of smooth, and apparently Lorenz never wanted to do more than one take because you're constantly seeing all of the major actors' eyes looking to the sides, apparently to read cue cards to get through their lines. A regrettable waste of A-list actors in the C-list hands of a first-time director and a first-time writer.On the plus side, the feel of the settings is well done, and you can believe that you're actually seeing Gus and Mickey doing a scouting mission in a small town where a local baseball star can be a big fish in a small pond. The music score by Marco Beltrami is also well done, setting the tone in the background without ever being intrusive so that you're barely aware that it's there, exactly the kind of score you need in a film like this.Recommended for Amy Adams' brilliant performance and for anyone interested in a film about baseball recruiting and doesn't mind if the rest of the film is routine and completely predictable.",3,"Eastwood gets a double, Timberlake walks, but Amy Adams knocks it out of the park in otherwise formula film",1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,8248,"['Trouble', 'Curve', 'watchable',

1591466,AP3B615GM191G,B009AMAK54,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[50, 51]","After starring in the remarkable ""Million Dollar Baby"" in 2004, then following it up with the gritty ""Gran Torino"" in 2008, Clint Eastwood announced his ""retirement"" from acting, instead focusing on on directing/producing films. When the script for ""Trouble with the Curve"" came along, though, Mr. Eastwood decided that it was too good of a vehicle to pass up. Thus, in his return to leading-man status, the 82-year old thespian proves that his filmmaking (or film-choosing) instincts are as solid as ever.For a basic plot summary, ""Trouble with the Curve"" focuses on Gus (Eastwood), an aged baseball scout who relies on his eyes, senses, and gut feelings to scout the top prospects. The trouble is, his eyes are failing and his job is on the line. As such, Gus's friend Pete (John Goodman) is concerned about him and gives a call to Mickey (Amy Adams), Gus's daughter. Predictably, the father-daughter duo do not share a strong relationship with each, and that is tested on a road trip together to scout the newest ""can't miss"" prospect. Along the way, rival scout Johnny (Justin Timberlake) teaches both parts of the duo a little something about each other and their lives.When evaluating ""Trouble with the Curve"", there is one thing that you must do: Absolutely DO NOT try to compare it to ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Gran Torino"". It's not even so much that it doesn't measure up to those movies (although it doesn't), but rather that it takes a bit of a different tone. It is a bit more light-hearted and not nearly as ""life-or-death serious"" as those other flicks.When looked at under its own merits, then, ""Curve"" is an excellent film that does everything it sets out to do. The plot is interesting enough to keep you invested, the emotion runs high throughout, and the acting is superb. Eastwood is his typical self, while Adams and Timberlake provide the much-needed camaraderie that a movie like this needs from time to time. The characters aren't quite as fleshed-out as a normal Eastwood movie (in this case, there is more ""telling"" of emotions than ""showing"", generally speaking), but they are still engaging.Basically, ""Trouble with the Curve"" is a conglomeration of a number of different themes (aging, fatherhood, baseball scouting, etc.) that work not in isolation but blended together. All those themes have been done better in other movies, but having them all play off each other still manages to produce a cinematic treat. I hope Eastwood still continues to shine ON the camera as well as BEHIND it, but if this does turn out to be his final acting role, there is no reason to look back with any regret.",4,Eastwood's Well-Rounded Return To Acting,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,2622,"['starring', 'remarkable', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', '2004', 'then', 'following', 'up', 'gritty', 'Gran', 'Torino', '2008', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'announced', 'retirement', 'acting', 'instead', 'focusing', 'directing/producing', 'films', 'When', 'script', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'came', 'along', 'though', 'Mr.', 'Eastwood', 'decided', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'vehicle', 'pass', 'up', 'Thus', 'return', 'leading-man', 'status', '82-year', 'old', 'thespian', 'filmmaking', 'film-choosing', 'instincts', 'are', 'as', 'solid', 'ever.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'Gus', 'Eastwood', 'aged', 'baseball', 'scout', 'who', 'eyes', 'senses', 'gut', 'feelings', 'scout', 'top', 'prospects', 'trouble', 'eyes', 'are', 'failing', 'job', 'line', 'such', 'Gus', 'friend', 'Pete', 'John', 'Goodman', 'concerned', 'call', 'Mickey', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Gus', 'daughter', 'Predictably', 'father-daughter', 'duo', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'strong', 'relationship', 'tested', 'road', 'trip', 'together', 'scout', 'newest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'prospect', 'way', 'rival', 'scout', 'Johnny', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'parts', 'duo', 'little', 'something', 'other', 'lives.When', 'evaluating', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'one', 'thing', 'must', 'do', 'Absolutely', 'DO', 'NOT', 'try', 'compare', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'not', 'even', 'so', 'much', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'movies', ""n't"", 'rather', 'bit', 'different', 'tone', 'bit', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'not', 'nearly', 'life-or-death', 'serious', 'other', 'flicks.When', 'looked', 'own', 'merits', 'then', 'Curve', 'excellent', 'film', 'everything', 'out', 'do', 'plot', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'invested', 'emotion', 'high', 'acting', 'superb', 'Eastwood', 'typical', 'self', 'Adams', 'Timberlake', 'provide', 'much-needed', 'camaraderie', 'movie', 'time', 'time', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'fleshed-out', 'normal', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'case', 'more', 'telling', 'emotions', 'showing', 'generally', 'speaking', 'are', 'still', 'engaging.Basically', 'Trouble', 'Curve', 'conglomeration', 'number', 'different', 'themes', 'aging', 'fatherhood', 'baseball', 'scouting', 'etc', 'work', 'not', 'isolation', 'blended', 'together', 'themes', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'other', 'movies', 'having', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'still', 'produce', 'cinematic', 'treat', 'hope', 'Eastwood', 'still', 'shine', 'ON', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'BEHIND', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'final', 'acting', 'role', 'reason', 'look', 'back', 'regret']",Trouble with the Curve
1591467,AB1CKA6B849SP,B009AMAK54,zeus,"[4, 4]","This is Clint Eastwood in another great movie representing an average individual. Not inspector Callahan but an everyday Joe with his problems and qualities.Clint plays the role of an aging baseball scout (Gus Lobel) who works for the Atlant Braves, and who is slowly losing his sight and the respect of the people around him. His daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) who is auditioning to became partner with a macho law firm (aren't all like this?...patronizing) must take time off and help him in his last assignment. At this point everybody knows what will happen to her partnership in the firm... but apparently she is resolved this time to help her father. During the trip many old family stories come out, including the fact that he had to practically abandon her when she was little after her mom died. They also meet another scout (Justin Timberlake) who is really more interested in ...Mickey than in baseball.As always, Clint Eastwood performance is outstanding. Reminded me of ""Bloodwoork"" where again he is weak and dependable. He also reminded me of ""Bloodwork"" because he is always fighting an arrogant young idiot who thinks he knows everything after few months on the job. Of course the plot in this movie is totally different from the one in ""Bloodwork"".This movie represents very accurately our society and what is happening these days. On one hand we have an old experienced guy who lives in a modest house with minimum furniture, who travels alot, and who is used to seat in the stands for years and years watching AAA and high school games all over the country and uses his on-the-field experience and instinct to select real baseball talent, not really caring for the payback. On the other side we have an arrogant idiot with an iPod and an iPhone with minimum education and a computer, who thinks that he knows everything because he can Google the player's name and check his statistics. Never saw him play but he is looking at the stats and therefore if he looks great on paper he must be a great player. In addition, anticipating that he will be in this job forever because he is so good (...because he has a computer), he is living the great life on a credit card (...but I just bought a boat and I have mortgage payments). Typical metrosexual that we usually expect to find in New York city, but he is in Atlanta and works for the Braves.This kind of attitude has real consequences in life. Just two examples. Look at the mess with the BCS. Every year it is a blow out because it is not the people on the side lines who decide which is the best team and which teams are going to play in the championship game. The computers decide (strength of schedule, stats etc). Look what happened to Tim Tebow. A decent human being with huge potential to become a great QB, coming out of a great school. The sportscasters ridiculed him because he is a Christian, putting up his bad stats all the time, to a point that now it will be difficult for him to come back. Only because the teams are affraid to offer him a contract because of what the sportscasters will say. If it weren't for the idiots sportscasters (who know everything because they have a computer in front of them and can draw footbal plays) he could have the starting QB position in a good team and with a decent QB coach he could have done well in the NFL.The ending of the movie is not surprising but is not predictable either. Really enjoyed the scene towards the end when Mickey disposes of her cell phone. There is so much patience to have with some people!This is a great solid family movie with great acting, a solid story, and great direction. Five stars all around. Thank you Mr. Eastwood for another great movie to put next to Bloodwork, Million dollar Baby, and Gran Torino.",5,Great family movie.,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,3757,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'great', 'movie', 'representing', 'average', 'individual', 'Not', 'inspector', 'Callahan', 'everyday', 'Joe', 'problems', 'qualities.Clint', 'role', 'aging', 'baseball', 'scout', 'Gus', 'Lobel', 'who', 'Atlant', 'Braves', 'who', 'slowly', 'losing', 'sight', 'respect', 'people', 'daughter', 'Mickey', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'auditioning', 'became', 'partner', 'macho', 'law', 'firm', 'are', ""n't"", 'patronizing', 'must', 'take', 'time', 'help', 'last', 'assignment', 'point', 'everybody', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'partnership', 'firm', 'apparently', 'resolved', 'time', 'help', 'father', 'trip', 'many', 'old', 'family', 'come', 'out', 'including', 'fact', 'had', 'practically', 'abandon', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'mom', 'died', 'also', 'meet', 'scout', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'who', 'really', 'more', 'interested', 'Mickey', 'baseball.As', 'always', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'Reminded', 'Bloodwoork', 'where', 'again', 'weak', 'dependable', 'also', 'reminded', 'Bloodwork', 'always', 'fighting', 'arrogant', 'young', 'idiot', 'who', 'everything', 'few', 'months', 'job', 'course', 'plot', 'movie', 'totally', 'different', 'one', 'Bloodwork', '.This', 'movie', 'very', 'accurately', 'society', 'what', 'happening', 'days', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'old', 'experienced', 'guy', 'who', 'modest', 'house', 'minimum', 'furniture', 'who', 'alot', 'who', 'used', 'seat', 'stands', 'years', 'years', 'watching', 'AAA', 'high', 'school', 'games', 'country', 'on-the-field', 'experience', 'instinct', 'select', 'real', 'baseball', 'talent', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'payback', 'other', 'side', 'have', 'arrogant', 'idiot', 'iPod', 'iPhone', 'minimum', 'education', 'computer', 'who', 'everything', 'can', 'Google', 'player', 'name', 'check', 'statistics', 'Never', 'saw', 'play', 'looking', 'stats', 'therefore', 'great', 'paper', 'must', 'be', 'great', 'player', 'addition', 'anticipating', 'will', 'be', 'job', 'forever', 'so', 'good', 'computer', 'living', 'great', 'life', 'credit', 'card', 'just', 'bought', 'boat', 'have', 'mortgage', 'payments', 'Typical', 'metrosexual', 'usually', 'expect', 'find', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'Atlanta', 'Braves.This', 'kind', 'attitude', 'real', 'consequences', 'life', 'Just', 'two', 'examples', 'Look', 'mess', 'BCS', 'year', 'blow', 'out', 'not', 'people', 'side', 'lines', 'who', 'decide', 'best', 'team', 'teams', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'championship', 'game', 'computers', 'decide', 'strength', 'schedule', 'stats', 'etc', 'Look', 'what', 'happened', 'Tim', 'Tebow', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'huge', 'potential', 'become', 'great', 'QB', 'coming', 'great', 'school', 'sportscasters', 'ridiculed', 'Christian', 'putting', 'up', 'bad', 'stats', 'time', 'point', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'come', 'back', 'Only', 'teams', 'are', 'affraid', 'offer', 'contract', 'what', 'sportscasters', 'will', 'say', 'were', ""n't"", 'idiots', 'sportscasters', 'who', 'know', 'everything', 'have', 'computer', 'front', 'can', 'draw', 'footbal', 'plays', 'could', 'have', 'starting', 'QB', 'position', 'good', 'team', 'decent', 'QB', 'coach', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'NFL.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'not', 'surprising', 'not', 'predictable', 'either', 'Really', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Mickey', 'cell', 'phone', 'so', 'much', 'patience', 'have', 'people', 'great', 'solid', 'family', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'solid', 'story', 'great', 'direction', 'Five', 'stars', 'around', 'Thank', 'Mr.', 'Eastwood', 'great', 'movie', 'put', 'next', 'Bloodwork', 'Million', 'dollar', 'Baby', 'Gran', 'Torino']",Trouble with the Curve
