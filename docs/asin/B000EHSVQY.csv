Peter Falk is especially good for an actors debut. But, he is not alone all the acting is good. Nothing over-done. Today's actors could learn a lot from these roles.Why four stars instead of five?

973644,A1N37L78ZREG8Y,B000EHSVQY,Carolyn Paetow,"[4, 5]","By the arithmitic of this review's title, this flick gets a mean score of 3.  But, with its lame, leaky script, late-fifties look, and poorly paced direction, it can scarcely be considered good.  Peter Falk is so fantastic, however, that it's as if he wandered in from a top-notch film noir onto the set of some mousy, mob-themed musical. When May Britt's character blasts him with a what-are-you-doing-here plaint, many viewers may have wondered the same.  Falk plays a hooligan hired by a crime boss to carry out hits.  He's to be on retainer with a bonus for each ordered bump-off and will deal only with the big fellow's right-hand henchman (who looks like an accountant).  Yet Falk is surprised and dismayed that he can't get no respect from these guys, the mob's mouthpiece, or a punk's pushy wifey.  He pressures a reluctant, naive debtor (who was fool enough to pay hospital bills instead of Falk) into abetting a hit that could easily be made without him.  Yet Falk's performance is so mesmerizing that one can almost overlook these anomalies.  But when he's not around, the plot's poverty is painfully obvious.  Take, for instance, the casting and role of May Britt.  She's a refugee (from Sweden??) who, after a terrifying sexual encounter with one gangster, shuffles around another in sheer lingerie and dares to repeatedly cook his eggs wrong.  Maybe her marabou-trimmed peignoir was supposed to remind the audience of a moll's in real thirties mobster films, because nothing else in the women's hairstyles, makeup, or clothing does.  It's all reminiscent of earlier period films where, regardless of the century portrayed, actresses had pencil-thin eyebrows, short, curling-ironed coiffs, and slinky dresses.  Though black-and-white filmography should have imparted a certain element of stylistic grittiness, the movie possesses a sort of garishness that might cause a viewer to recall Britt's negligee as bright pink or her velvety sofa as sky blue.  The set holding the latter is one of the few spacious ones.  Some are oddly cramped, like the crime boss's waiting room, a neighborhood diner, and particulary the hotel rooms where stoolies are being held.  At least the shotgun-style diner is made interesting by Helen Waters as its noirishly fat proprietor.  Next to Falk, she's the most intriguing character in a movie dulled by intrusive narration, flat cop roles, and pace-breaking plot devices like Britt dancing, Morey Amsterdam telling jokes, and Sarah Vaughan singing one whole number.  The soundtrack of her obviously pre-recorded song doesn't even match her mouth movements!",3,"Peter Falk--5, Remainder of the Movie--1",1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,2600,"['arithmitic', 'review', 'title', 'flick', 'mean', 'score', '3', 'lame', 'leaky', 'script', 'late-fifties', 'look', 'poorly', 'paced', 'direction', 'can', 'scarcely', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'so', 'fantastic', 'however', 'wandered', 'top-notch', 'film', 'noir', 'set', 'mousy', 'mob-themed', 'musical', 'When', 'May', 'Britt', 'character', 'what-are-you-doing-here', 'plaint', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'wondered', 'same', 'Falk', 'hooligan', 'hired', 'crime', 'boss', 'carry', 'out', 'hits', 'be', 'retainer', 'bonus', 'ordered', 'bump-off', 'will', 'deal', 'only', 'big', 'fellow', 'right-hand', 'henchman', 'who', 'accountant', 'Falk', 'surprised', 'dismayed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'respect', 'guys', 'mob', 'mouthpiece', 'punk', 'pushy', 'wifey', 'reluctant', 'naive', 'debtor', 'who', 'was', 'fool', 'enough', 'pay', 'hospital', 'bills', 'instead', 'Falk', 'abetting', 'hit', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'Falk', 'performance', 'so', 'mesmerizing', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'overlook', 'anomalies', 'when', 'not', 'around', 'plot', 'poverty', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Take', 'instance', 'casting', 'role', 'May', 'Britt', 'refugee', 'Sweden', 'who', 'terrifying', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'one', 'gangster', 'around', 'sheer', 'lingerie', 'dares', 'repeatedly', 'cook', 'eggs', 'wrong', 'Maybe', 'marabou-trimmed', 'peignoir', 'was', 'supposed', 'remind', 'audience', 'moll', 'real', 'thirties', 'mobster', 'films', 'nothing', 'else', 'women', 'hairstyles', 'makeup', 'clothing', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', 'period', 'films', 'where', 'regardless', 'century', 'portrayed', 'actresses', 'had', 'pencil-thin', 'eyebrows', 'short', 'curling-ironed', 'coiffs', 'slinky', 'dresses', 'black-and-white', 'filmography', 'should', 'have', 'imparted', 'certain', 'element', 'stylistic', 'grittiness', 'movie', 'sort', 'garishness', 'might', 'cause', 'viewer', 'recall', 'Britt', 'negligee', 'bright', 'pink', 'velvety', 'sofa', 'sky', 'blue', 'set', 'holding', 'latter', 'one', 'few', 'spacious', 'ones', 'are', 'oddly', 'cramped', 'crime', 'boss', 'waiting', 'room', 'neighborhood', 'diner', 'particulary', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'where', 'stoolies', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'least', 'shotgun-style', 'diner', 'made', 'interesting', 'Helen', 'Waters', 'noirishly', 'fat', 'proprietor', 'Next', 'Falk', 'most', 'intriguing', 'character', 'movie', 'dulled', 'intrusive', 'narration', 'flat', 'cop', 'roles', 'pace-breaking', 'plot', 'devices', 'Britt', 'dancing', 'Morey', 'Amsterdam', 'telling', 'jokes', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'singing', 'one', 'whole', 'number', 'soundtrack', 'obviously', 'pre-recorded', 'song', ""n't"", 'even', 'match', 'mouth', 'movements']","Murder, Inc.

Although the vintage cars are possibly the only real indicator of the timeframe (since the dialogue doesn't use much, if any, of the slang at that time in vogue), Falk's propulsive acting moves the movie slam-bang from beginning to end.The aforementioned supporting cast includes Stuart Whitman before he started grating on most moviegoers' nerves, May Britt as his sexy wife, and Simon Oakland (really good) and Henry Morgan as the two cops committed to bringing down Murder Inc, as well as Vincent Gardenia (when he was actually thin!!) as Reles' sleazy lawyer (Gardenia is also very good here).Hard to believe that the rumpled seemingly confused Columbo got his silver screen start as a really nasty piece of work, but there you go. He's a lot of fun to watch.

973657,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B000EHSVQY,Pork Chop,"[1, 1]","Murder, Inc. (1960) is worth renting as a DVD, for the simple reason thatit shows the ugliness of murder, rubouts, contract killings in a Post-Prohibitionera, during which various gangs cooperated in a national syndicate, for profitmaximization as opposed to rival gangs competing for the same turf.In fact, the gangs now prefer taking the low key approach, staying off the radar screen oflaw enforcement. The biggest profit generators the movies suggests, are shakedowns of themanagement of a company, by micromanaging the labor unions and their ability to strike andhold the company hostage for a large pay increase unless the underworld is used to mitigatethe union's greed, or so they say. Another one, is the protection money requiredfrom shopkeepers, under the risk of retaliation and complete destruction of their livelihood(  of the actual productive assets and inventory) should they refuse and resist payment.This work is completely non-glossy in terms of a film, as it shows the underbelly of crime,and the actual implications of taking part in the underworld, once the gang draws theattention of law enforcement and the top bosses rub out their own helping hands, to avoidbeing connected with the dastardly deeds they ordered be carried out.One of the few artistic merits of their work, is the clarity, sharpness and good editingcoupled with the great wide-screen release, while the story itself (the script) is mixedwith a sentimental love story (perhaps not grounded in reality) to keep viewers interesteddespite  the hard hitting facts. Clearly, this movie was intended  as an ""educational tool""by the police, to discourage crime and enlighten youth from partaking in profit generatingbut illegal behavior.Centered in Brooklyn, NY in the 1930's,  the film is modern except for the telephones, andautomobiles shown, whereas the rest has stood the test of time.The protagnonist, Falk, is an enigma, as sometimes he appears aloof,  like a sitting duckor Momma's Boy,  but at other times, able to transform himself as a hard hitting criminal,keen to violence,  even to ruthlessness and generosity so long as it suits his agenda, evenrape. His oversized coat draws away from the movie's credibility, as it looks it just cameoff the clothes rack, spotless, no dust.It also  gives horse betting and pawnshop keepers a bad name, as shylocking and betting iscondoned.The movie is also brave, in terms of the mini skirts of the dancing girls shown on screen,as the gangsters enjoy the entertainment of night clubs as well as crooners and the girls.The story is valuable in showing how peer and economic pressures can sometimes push anhonest but vulnerable man to get involved in criminal activities, even when simply drivingor cooperating on a contract, vs. pulling the trigger.For those familiar with the hierarchy found in the military, that of the underworldsyndicate is much alike, in the expectation of taking orders from the top without askingquestions, and respecting higher ranked individuals in the movement.The psychology of criminals is also portrayed as that of  greedy individuals, who areunable  to tame their desires and impulses. Falk yells "" Whatever I want, I take! That'swhat hands are for! To take!""Bizarrely, the script is critical and mocking of showgirls as  worthy housewives, as theycan't cook, (boil an egg), dress themselves decently or even maintain an interestingconversation. It also associates those characteristics with  women from European countries,who arrive to the USA, as opposed to home grown USA women.Overall, the story tells how 200 murders in 2 years were committed in Brooklyn alone, by asmall gang for maximizing their underworld revenue generation operations.The story touches slightly on the law, in terms of Habeas Corpus, and corroboratingwitnesseses and subpoenas and the like - needed in preparation of a court date,  and how,at the end of the day, st00l pigeons are a gang's archilles heel.",3,"Educating, sober and interesting",1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,3946,"['Murder', 'Inc.', '1960', 'worth', 'renting', 'DVD', 'simple', 'reason', 'thatit', 'ugliness', 'murder', 'rubouts', 'contract', 'killings', 'Post-Prohibitionera', 'various', 'gangs', 'cooperated', 'national', 'syndicate', 'profitmaximization', 'opposed', 'rival', 'gangs', 'competing', 'same', 'turf.In', 'fact', 'gangs', 'now', 'prefer', 'taking', 'low', 'key', 'approach', 'staying', 'off', 'radar', 'screen', 'oflaw', 'enforcement', 'biggest', 'profit', 'generators', 'movies', 'are', 'shakedowns', 'themanagement', 'company', 'micromanaging', 'labor', 'unions', 'ability', 'strike', 'company', 'hostage', 'large', 'pay', 'increase', 'underworld', 'used', 'mitigatethe', 'union', 'greed', 'so', 'say', 'one', 'protection', 'money', 'requiredfrom', 'shopkeepers', 'risk', 'retaliation', 'complete', 'destruction', 'livelihood', 'actual', 'productive', 'assets', 'inventory', 'should', 'refuse', 'resist', 'payment.This', 'work', 'completely', 'non-glossy', 'terms', 'film', 'underbelly', 'crime', 'actual', 'implications', 'taking', 'part', 'underworld', 'once', 'gang', 'theattention', 'law', 'enforcement', 'top', 'bosses', 'rub', 'out', 'own', 'helping', 'hands', 'avoidbeing', 'connected', 'dastardly', 'ordered', 'be', 'carried', 'out.One', 'few', 'artistic', 'merits', 'work', 'clarity', 'sharpness', 'good', 'editingcoupled', 'great', 'wide-screen', 'release', 'story', 'script', 'mixedwith', 'sentimental', 'love', 'story', 'perhaps', 'not', 'grounded', 'reality', 'keep', 'viewers', 'interesteddespite', 'hard', 'hitting', 'facts', 'Clearly', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'educational', 'tool', 'police', 'discourage', 'crime', 'enlighten', 'youth', 'partaking', 'profit', 'generatingbut', 'illegal', 'behavior.Centered', 'Brooklyn', 'NY', '1930', 'film', 'modern', 'telephones', 'andautomobiles', 'shown', 'rest', 'stood', 'test', 'time.The', 'protagnonist', 'Falk', 'enigma', 'sometimes', 'aloof', 'sitting', 'duckor', 'Momma', 'Boy', 'other', 'times', 'able', 'transform', 'hard', 'hitting', 'criminal', 'keen', 'violence', 'even', 'ruthlessness', 'generosity', 'so', 'long', 'suits', 'agenda', 'evenrape', 'oversized', 'coat', 'away', 'movie', 'credibility', 'just', 'cameoff', 'clothes', 'rack', 'spotless', 'dust.It', 'also', 'horse', 'betting', 'pawnshop', 'keepers', 'bad', 'name', 'shylocking', 'betting', 'iscondoned.The', 'movie', 'also', 'brave', 'terms', 'mini', 'skirts', 'dancing', 'girls', 'shown', 'screen', 'gangsters', 'enjoy', 'entertainment', 'night', 'clubs', 'as', 'well', 'crooners', 'girls.The', 'story', 'valuable', 'showing', 'how', 'peer', 'economic', 'pressures', 'can', 'sometimes', 'push', 'anhonest', 'vulnerable', 'man', 'get', 'involved', 'criminal', 'activities', 'even', 'when', 'simply', 'drivingor', 'cooperating', 'contract', 'vs.', 'pulling', 'trigger.For', 'familiar', 'hierarchy', 'found', 'military', 'underworldsyndicate', 'much', 'alike', 'expectation', 'taking', 'orders', 'top', 'askingquestions', 'respecting', 'higher', 'ranked', 'individuals', 'movement.The', 'psychology', 'criminals', 'also', 'portrayed', 'greedy', 'individuals', 'who', 'areunable', 'tame', 'desires', 'impulses', 'Falk', 'want', 'take', 'hands', 'are', 'take', 'Bizarrely', 'script', 'critical', 'mocking', 'showgirls', 'worthy', 'housewives', 'theyca', ""n't"", 'cook', 'egg', 'dress', 'decently', 'even', 'maintain', 'interestingconversation', 'also', 'characteristics', 'women', 'European', 'countries', 'who', 'arrive', 'USA', 'opposed', 'home', 'grown', 'USA', 'women.Overall', 'story', 'how', '200', 'murders', '2', 'years', 'were', 'committed', 'Brooklyn', 'alone', 'gang', 'maximizing', 'underworld', 'revenue', 'generation', 'story', 'touches', 'slightly', 'law', 'terms', 'Habeas', 'Corpus', 'corroboratingwitnesseses', 'subpoenas', 'like', 'needed', 'preparation', 'court', 'date', 'how', 'end', 'day', 'st00l', 'pigeons', 'are', 'gang', 'archilles', 'heel']","Murder, Inc.

973660,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B000EHSVQY,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","Peter Falk became so indelibly associated with the seemingly bumbling, self deprecating TV detective Columbo that many people forget (or are simply unaware) that he had a solid career as a dramatic film actor before that. Falk first gained public attention (and a well deserved Oscar nomination) as the vicious gangster Abe ""Kid Twist"" Reles in the based-on-fact mob expose, ""Murder, Inc.""Released in 1960, ""Murder, Inc."" is the story of the infamous group of mob assassins of the same name organized by Louis ""Lepke"" Buchalter, the man who orchestrated the killing of Dutch Schultz. Buchalter hired freelance killers, usually lower level gangsters, and kept them on retainer so they would be available as needed. One of these hired killers was Abe Reles, a small time loan shark who moonlighted as one of Lepke's hit men. Eventually, Reles would turn state's evidence, and his testimony was instrumental in sending Lepke to the electric chair, making him the only major mob boss ever executed for murder.""Murder, Inc."" is based on a book by Burton Turkus (played by Henry Morgan in the film), the assistant district attorney who turned Reles and convicted a number of Murder, Inc. killers. The book concentrated on Lepke, Reles, and the other mobsters Turkus encountered over the years. Peter Falk's portrayal of Abe Reles is perfect for the material. As played by Falk, Reles is a stone cold but very shrewd psycho, given to fits of rage, but also capable of turning on the charm on occasion. He easily dominates every scene he is in, playing a character somewhat similar to the one that would win Joe Pesci an Oscar decades later in ""Goodfellas.""However, the film's producers, influenced by the highly successful TV series, ""The Untouchables,"" decided to shift the emphasis away from Reles and the deceptively mild mannered Lepke (nicely played by little known character actor David J. Stewart). Neither the bland Morgan nor the various cops in the movie are well suited in the protagonist role, so the film creates a fictional central character, Joey, a small time musician played by Stuart Whitman. Joey has a gambling problem and gets deeply in debt to Reles, who agrees to let Joey off the hook if the musician will serve as the getaway driver for some of Reles' killings. Joey's wife, Eadie (May Britt), a nightclub dancer, also attracts the attention of Reles and, later, Lepke. The film hints at the demands the gangsters make of Eadie, whose outspoken defiance threatens to get the couple in trouble.Although Whitman is an underrated actor, the character of Joey is badly underwritten, and he lacks any spark with Britt. She has the requisite sex appeal, but not the acting skills for her role. As a result, the couple at the center of the movie have little chemistry together and lack the heft to carry the film, which, as a result, suffers badly whenever Reles is not on screen. Further, when Henry Morgan finally makes his appearance as Turkus two-thirds of the way through the movie, the action grinds to a near complete halt when it should be leading up to a climactic trial.Another big problem with the movie is that the factual background of the movie is never made quite clear. It's obvious that Lepke, Reles, and the rest are dangerous, evil men, but the film glosses over many of the facts in the real case, including the nature of the intense two-year manhunt that went on for Lepke (who, in the film, was an unwelcome houseguest of Joey and Eadie for some unspecified period of time). An entire movie could have been centered on the effect Lepke had on the couple's relationship and the events that eventually induced him to surrender. Instead, the film merely reduces these events to about three scenes, only one of which (featuring Eadie trying to wait on Lepke but eventually having a temper tantrum) is effective.""Murder, Inc."" isn't a great, or even a very good, mob film, but it isn't merely a showcase for Falk. The moody black-and-white cinematography fits the piece quite well, and the movie features a very rare appearance by the legendary Sarah Vaughan as a night club singer. Still, watching ""Murder, Inc."" won't give viewers much of a feel either for the real life gangsters portrayed in the movie or the American gangster movie. Although the movie looks and sounds good (and has some other nice supporting performances), there's still only one reason, albeit a very good reason, to see this movie, and that' s Peter Falk. In a better movie, his Abe Reles would be hailed as one of the best villainous performances of all time. Even in this average film, that performance is enough for me to recommend the movie.",3,A Twist of Falk,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,4648,"['Peter', 'Falk', 'became', 'so', 'indelibly', 'associated', 'seemingly', 'bumbling', 'deprecating', 'TV', 'detective', 'Columbo', 'many', 'people', 'forget', 'are', 'simply', 'unaware', 'had', 'solid', 'career', 'dramatic', 'film', 'actor', 'Falk', 'first', 'gained', 'public', 'attention', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'vicious', 'gangster', 'Abe', 'Kid', 'Twist', 'Reles', 'based-on-fact', 'mob', 'expose', 'Murder', 'Inc.', 'Released', '1960', 'Murder', 'Inc.', 'story', 'infamous', 'group', 'mob', 'assassins', 'same', 'name', 'organized', 'Louis', 'Lepke', 'Buchalter', 'man', 'who', 'orchestrated', 'killing', 'Dutch', 'Schultz', 'Buchalter', 'hired', 'freelance', 'killers', 'usually', 'lower', 'level', 'gangsters', 'kept', 'retainer', 'would', 'be', 'available', 'needed', 'One', 'hired', 'killers', 'was', 'Abe', 'Reles', 'small', 'time', 'loan', 'shark', 'who', 'moonlighted', 'one', 'Lepke', 'hit', 'men', 'Eventually', 'Reles', 'would', 'turn', 'state', 'evidence', 'testimony', 'was', 'instrumental', 'sending', 'Lepke', 'electric', 'chair', 'making', 'only', 'major', 'mob', 'boss', 'ever', 'executed', 'murder', 'Murder', 'Inc.', 'based', 'book', 'Burton', 'Turkus', 'played', 'Henry', 'Morgan', 'film', 'assistant', 'district', 'attorney', 'who', 'turned', 'Reles', 'convicted', 'number', 'Murder', 'Inc.', 'killers', 'book', 'concentrated', 'Lepke', 'Reles', 'other', 'mobsters', 'Turkus', 'encountered', 'years', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'portrayal', 'Abe', 'Reles', 'perfect', 'material', 'played', 'Falk', 'Reles', 'stone', 'cold', 'very', 'shrewd', 'psycho', 'given', 'fits', 'rage', 'also', 'capable', 'turning', 'charm', 'occasion', 'easily', 'scene', 'playing', 'character', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'one', 'would', 'win', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Oscar', 'decades', 'later', 'Goodfellas', 'However', 'film', 'producers', 'influenced', 'highly', 'successful', 'TV', 'series', 'Untouchables', 'decided', 'shift', 'emphasis', 'away', 'Reles', 'deceptively', 'mild', 'mannered', 'Lepke', 'nicely', 'played', 'little', 'known', 'character', 'actor', 'David', 'J.', 'Stewart', 'bland', 'Morgan', 'various', 'cops', 'movie', 'are', 'well', 'suited', 'protagonist', 'role', 'film', 'fictional', 'central', 'character', 'Joey', 'small', 'time', 'musician', 'played', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'Joey', 'gambling', 'problem', 'deeply', 'debt', 'Reles', 'who', 'let', 'Joey', 'hook', 'musician', 'will', 'serve', 'getaway', 'driver', 'Reles', 'killings', 'Joey', 'wife', 'Eadie', 'May', 'Britt', 'nightclub', 'dancer', 'also', 'attention', 'Reles', 'later', 'Lepke', 'film', 'hints', 'demands', 'gangsters', 'make', 'Eadie', 'outspoken', 'defiance', 'threatens', 'get', 'couple', 'trouble.Although', 'Whitman', 'underrated', 'actor', 'character', 'Joey', 'badly', 'underwritten', 'spark', 'Britt', 'requisite', 'sex', 'appeal', 'not', 'acting', 'skills', 'role', 'result', 'couple', 'center', 'movie', 'have', 'little', 'chemistry', 'together', 'lack', 'heft', 'carry', 'film', 'result', 'suffers', 'badly', 'whenever', 'Reles', 'not', 'screen', 'Further', 'when', 'Henry', 'Morgan', 'finally', 'appearance', 'Turkus', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'movie', 'action', 'near', 'complete', 'halt', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'leading', 'up', 'climactic', 'trial.Another', 'big', 'problem', 'movie', 'factual', 'background', 'movie', 'never', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'obvious', 'Lepke', 'Reles', 'rest', 'are', 'dangerous', 'evil', 'men', 'film', 'many', 'facts', 'real', 'case', 'including', 'nature', 'intense', 'two-year', 'manhunt', 'went', 'Lepke', 'who', 'film', 'was', 'unwelcome', 'houseguest', 'Joey', 'Eadie', 'unspecified', 'period', 'time', 'entire', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'centered', 'effect', 'Lepke', 'had', 'couple', 'relationship', 'events', 'eventually', 'induced', 'surrender', 'Instead', 'film', 'merely', 'events', 'three', 'scenes', 'only', 'one', 'featuring', 'Eadie', 'trying', 'wait', 'Lepke', 'eventually', 'having', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'effective', 'Murder', 'Inc.', ""n't"", 'great', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'mob', 'film', ""n't"", 'merely', 'showcase', 'Falk', 'moody', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'piece', 'quite', 'well', 'movie', 'very', 'rare', 'appearance', 'legendary', 'Sarah', 'Vaughan', 'night', 'club', 'singer', 'Still', 'watching', 'Murder', 'Inc.', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'viewers', 'much', 'feel', 'either', 'real', 'life', 'gangsters', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'American', 'gangster', 'movie', 'movie', 'good', 'other', 'nice', 'supporting', 'performances', 'still', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 's', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'better', 'movie', 'Abe', 'Reles', 'would', 'be', 'hailed', 'one', 'best', 'villainous', 'performances', 'time', 'Even', 'average', 'film', 'performance', 'enough', 'recommend', 'movie']","Murder, Inc.
