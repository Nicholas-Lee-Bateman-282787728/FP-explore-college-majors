505094,A1H1CTEAYK0G9S,B00000IQXK,Lady Kathryn,"[0, 0]","Love this movie!  First let me warn you:  The quality of the tape is very poor--a lot of distortion.  I purchased two copies and they were exactly the same, both distorted.  Not available on DVD--not sure it ever will be, so didn't wait and got the VHS.  If it does come out on DVD, I'll be the first to buy it--it's that good!  This is a very sweet love story of two people destined to meet and fall in love.  It is a forbidden love because one is married.  The actors are the best.  Not familiar with the woman, but the lead male is dreamy Robert Urich.  He's truly wonderful and aptly suited for the role.  It wouldn't be the same movie without him.  I miss him terribly and try to find as many of his movies as I can on tape.  This is perhaps his best--at least close to it.  If you love Harlequin Romance movies, you'll love this one, too.  Well worth the price.",5,Romance on Film,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,867,"['Love', 'movie', 'First', 'let', 'warn', 'quality', 'tape', 'very', 'poor', 'lot', 'distortion', 'purchased', 'two', 'copies', 'were', 'exactly', 'same', 'distorted', 'Not', 'available', 'DVD', 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'wait', 'got', 'VHS', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'buy', 'good', 'very', 'sweet', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'destined', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'forbidden', 'love', 'one', 'married', 'actors', 'are', 'best', 'Not', 'familiar', 'woman', 'lead', 'male', 'dreamy', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'aptly', 'suited', 'role', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'movie', 'miss', 'terribly', 'try', 'find', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'tape', 'perhaps', 'best', 'least', 'close', 'love', 'Harlequin', 'Romance', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'too', 'Well', 'price']",Danielle Steel's A Perfect Stranger VHS
