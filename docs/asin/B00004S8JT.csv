The dreadful departure from the books aside, you would not recognize the &quot;new&quot; Anne as the free spirited yet innocent girl of the first 2 movies.  Where she would have acquired this new sense of &quot;worldliness&quot; I can't imagine (there's not a man in the whole movie whom she doesn't touch with more than sisterly affection; and the anti-war sentiment she displays is insulting to the Anne of the book series).  But if Kevin Sullivan thought that this would make her more appealing to today's audiences, he was sorely mistaken. What makes the Anne of Green Gables movies so appealing (and the books even more so), is the timeless beauty, mirth, and innocence that is so lacking from our own society.  It resonates with something in the heart of those who &quot;belong to the race of Joseph&quot;, which part I THOUGHT Kevin Sullivan ascribed to.

I am so disappointed there are not words to express it. I am usually less critical of movie versions of favorite books than most of my friends... but this movie broke my heart with its awfulness. I couldn't figure out how to give it zero stars... but if I could have, I would have.The entire Anne of Green Gables series is my favorite series of books. I have read them all dozens of times. I always say that I have a hard time deciding which is my favorite - the first or the last. If they had to put Anne and Gilbert in a WWI movie (her children fought in the war, not Gilbert)... WHY oh WHY couldn't they have used storylines from Rilla of Ingleside? The Anne I know and love is a dreamer. The third movie takes her ""impetuous"" nature (which she outgrows by her Redmond years, mostly) and runs with it... and completely ignores the aspect of Anne that is clever, and witty, and... kindred spirit-y. The Anne in this movie is NOT of the ""race that knows Joseph.""I hated this movie so much that I won't even resell it to get it out of my house... then someone else would have to be subjected to it and I couldn't forgive myself for that. It just breaks my heart to have the first two movies desecrated by this 3rd... movie, for lack of a better word.DON'T see it if you love LM Montgomery as I do.

Although, seeing some of the old cast members did bring a smile to my face. :)But I still wonder why in the world they didn't follow the storyline from the books better (remember, the first original films didn't really follow the books but they were much more cautious and respectful to Lucy Maud Montgomery's work). They could have easily followed (at the very least) ""Anne's House of Dreams"" about life after Gilbert and Anne were married (speaking of which, Anne and Gil may as well 'eloped'. It sure felt like it because of their 'speedy' wedding...RIDICULOUS!). I guess the writers, producers...etc were 'nervous' that *if* they 'did' follow the original storyline, it wouldn't be as ""exciting"" as a WWI topic they pulled (which twisted the series around). I guess to them, watching things blow up is more exciting than watching couple of women drink tea. They have to remember that the reason why the first two were so popular was because the movie didn't follow the 'protocol' of excitement that so many of us are fed these days with the technology in movies. Had they kept the storyline from the books as they should have done, the ratings here could have been MUCH different.A little additional note... 'we' Gilbert/Anne romance fans would have happily overlooked missing the actual wedding between the two characters in place where we could see their life after the ceremony with Gilbert's first years of him being a doctor and Anne's life while meeting new characters. It certainly would have been better.One thing that absolutely BOTHERED me to no end was how they made Diana's husband and Anne too close for comfort. I simply didn't feel the 'passion' Gilbert and Anne had together in this film as when they last left us in a embrace at the end of the second movie. That in itself was a insult to the whole series and the many many years of fans discovering these wonderful books. And mostly, it's a slap in the face to Lucy Maud Montgomery!I truly hope that SOMEONE who was in charge (or can be in charge) see these reviews and reconsider remaking another finale Green Gables movie where they can bypass their blatant mistake of this one.

But also because substantial portions of this film were taken up with World War One, and I don't remember anything about Anne going to war in the books. She grows up, goes to New York with Gilbert while he's in residence at Bellevue (I was a patient there once, but it had changed significantly in the meantime), works for a publishing company, and eventually has a book published. When she and Gilbert have both had quite enough of New York (and, by implication, of Yankees), they return to PEI to discover that the people who bought Green Gables had rented it out to some trashy people who very nearly destroyed it, which broke Anne's heart. Marilla's death is only mentioned in passing.Then Diana's husband Fred volunteers for the Army, and when Gilbert goes to volunteer at a local veteran's hospital, he finds that the soldiers who are being returned home had not been treated properly in the field hospitals, or even on board the ships coming home, and he volunteers, too.Anne's letters to Gilbert come back to her as unforwardable, and so she decides to go to France and see if she can find out what has happened to him. There are many adventures in between, but she does eventually find him. Almost none of this movie corresponds to anything in the books, but that does not make it a bad movie. It's pretty good, although I seem to recall I gave the first one five stars, the second four, and this one three.

Plus, she and Gil were long-married, not just newlyweds.2)  Patriotism:  The filmmaker adds a sordid anachronistic ""anti-war"" theme which was absolutely not present in Anne's character, nor in her community.3) Senitmental pap:  Anne was headstrong, but also a pragmatist.  She'd never have traipsed through the European battlefields searching for Gil -- nor put herself in compromising situations with friends.  At that time, no well-bred lady would have been sharing a hotel room with a man to whom she was not married.4) The cry baby:  Throughout the last 3/4 of the movie, Anne lugs around a giant baby (at least 9 months old), which is accompanied by the soundtrack of a newborn infant wailing.

549574,A1XYFI8215KTF6,B00004S8JT,Colleen Chen,"[13, 18]","I'd second most of what's been said in the other reviews here--that it's nothing like the books and hasn't much of the magic of the first two movies.  Actually it's outright depressing.  And, it's a betrayal of LM Montgomery's books--it's kind of like seeing all the actors from the previous two movies playing different characters in a movie unrelated to anything she wrote.  It's kind of surreal and puzzling, not to mention BORING.  There's no sense to the plot--what the heck was the point of writing in as part of the screenplay Anne going to New York?  That entire section seemed totally irrelevant.  If Kevin Sullivan was going to depart from the books so completely, he might have tried to write something with at least a little internal coherence instead of a series of lackluster scenes without any overlying themes.Since the characters are all 13 years older than in the movie before, there are some inevitable changes.  One of these that I can't get over is Anne's voice, which is much deeper.  She hardly smiles at all in this movie and it's no wonder because it's dang depressing the whole way through, with this dark overtone as in any war movie.The extra half star over one that I'd like to give this are for the acting, which is pretty decent; Megan Follows particularly I think has improved as an actress.  Also Anne's hair isn't ridiculously and artificially bouffant like in the 2nd movie; it's just the right size and color.  Gilbert Blythe is much cuter in this movie than in the other two (the first one he had this strange perm, the second he still had baby fat on his face), and his chemistry with Anne is much more believable here too--in the second movie they seemed so asexual, whereas here their passion for each other is evident and I can actually imagine that they'd have enough sex to produce the huge brood Anne does in the books.All in all a disappointment and also a movie that, because of how it strays so completely from the timeline of the books, makes it near impossible to make another sequel based on Rilla of Ingleside or other stories of Anne's children.",1,Actually 1.5 stars,1149206400,"06 2, 2006",2006,2097,"[""'d"", 'second', 'most', 'what', 'been', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'nothing', 'books', ""n't"", 'much', 'magic', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'Actually', 'outright', 'depressing', 'betrayal', 'LM', 'Montgomery', 'books', 'kind', 'seeing', 'actors', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'playing', 'different', 'characters', 'movie', 'unrelated', 'anything', 'wrote', 'kind', 'surreal', 'puzzling', 'not', 'mention', 'BORING', 'sense', 'plot', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'point', 'writing', 'part', 'screenplay', 'Anne', 'going', 'New', 'York', 'entire', 'section', 'seemed', 'totally', 'irrelevant', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'was', 'going', 'depart', 'books', 'so', 'completely', 'might', 'have', 'tried', 'write', 'something', 'least', 'little', 'internal', 'coherence', 'instead', 'series', 'lackluster', 'scenes', 'overlying', 'themes.Since', 'characters', 'are', '13', 'years', 'older', 'movie', 'are', 'inevitable', 'changes', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'over', 'Anne', 'voice', 'much', 'deeper', 'hardly', 'movie', 'wonder', 'dang', 'depressing', 'whole', 'way', 'dark', 'overtone', 'war', 'movie.The', 'extra', 'half', 'star', 'one', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', 'are', 'acting', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'particularly', 'think', 'improved', 'actress', 'Also', 'Anne', 'hair', ""n't"", 'ridiculously', 'artificially', 'bouffant', '2nd', 'movie', 'just', 'right', 'size', 'color', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'much', 'cuter', 'movie', 'other', 'two', 'first', 'one', 'had', 'strange', 'perm', 'second', 'still', 'had', 'baby', 'fat', 'face', 'chemistry', 'Anne', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'here', 'too', 'second', 'movie', 'seemed', 'so', 'asexual', 'whereas', 'here', 'passion', 'other', 'evident', 'can', 'actually', 'imagine', ""'d"", 'have', 'enough', 'sex', 'produce', 'huge', 'brood', 'Anne', 'books.All', 'disappointment', 'also', 'movie', 'how', 'so', 'completely', 'timeline', 'books', 'impossible', 'make', 'sequel', 'based', 'Rilla', 'Ingleside', 'other', 'stories', 'Anne', 'children']",Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story VHS
549575,A23UB49EG29MVT,B00004S8JT,Commenter77,"[0, 1]","It is disappointing that this continuation veered entirely from the book chronicle, which is excellent, but I have to say that it is a worthy enough presentation in production values.  They just couldn't resist the common urge to ""update"" the character to the ""modern ideal,"" according to the media anyway.  However, Anne was and is rock solid in her convictions, somewhat impulsive still, loyal to the death, certainly parts of her character.  But the books know nothing of these events. It is a tribute more to Megan Follows than to LM Montgomery.  The character of Anne is stellar and the Follows portrayal the same. though I agree she shows more wear here than her film contemporaries.  Yet, she delivers the book's wonderful girl and amazing woman.  Gilbert grows up very responsibly as well. I thought the actor's portrayal very nuanced, attractive and finely executed.However, again, this episode is an entire invention and departure from the author's accounts.  Anne and Gilbert moved to their first house (House of Dreams) upon their marriage in another part of the island where Gilbert obtained his first medical practice.  Then, as they outgrew the house, they move to Ingleside, where most of her children were born and raised.  What is wrong with that?  Nothing at all. Mr. Sullivan, et al elected to position Gilbert in the war, perhaps for the adventurous element. The book facts are that Anne and Gilbert's grown sons went to war, Gilbert being too old by then and about the only established doctor in a large radius.  Anne never lost access to Green Gables, nor did it run down to shack status.  Diana's husband and marital situation are not developed in the books. There are needfully many new characters to go with the entirely new circumstances.Credit must be given to the truly outstanding portrayals and overall authenticity of character development in this offering.  I was most impressed with the quality of performance from Ms. Follows in this. However, it remains a puzzling deviation from the books, which series is a merited classic.  Thus, four stars for performance and development of character, withholding the fifth due to disappointment over the totally invented circumstances.",4,"Mis-scripted, but Quality Presentation",1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,2210,"['disappointing', 'continuation', 'veered', 'entirely', 'book', 'chronicle', 'excellent', 'have', 'say', 'worthy', 'enough', 'presentation', 'production', 'values', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'common', 'urge', 'update', 'character', 'modern', 'ideal', 'according', 'media', 'anyway', 'However', 'Anne', 'was', 'rock', 'solid', 'convictions', 'somewhat', 'impulsive', 'still', 'loyal', 'death', 'certainly', 'parts', 'character', 'books', 'know', 'nothing', 'events', 'tribute', 'more', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'LM', 'Montgomery', 'character', 'Anne', 'stellar', 'Follows', 'portrayal', 'same', 'agree', 'more', 'wear', 'here', 'film', 'contemporaries', 'book', 'wonderful', 'girl', 'amazing', 'woman', 'Gilbert', 'up', 'very', 'responsibly', 'as', 'well', 'thought', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'very', 'nuanced', 'attractive', 'finely', 'executed.However', 'again', 'episode', 'entire', 'invention', 'departure', 'author', 'accounts', 'Anne', 'Gilbert', 'moved', 'first', 'house', 'House', 'Dreams', 'marriage', 'part', 'island', 'where', 'Gilbert', 'obtained', 'first', 'medical', 'practice', 'Then', 'outgrew', 'house', 'move', 'Ingleside', 'where', 'most', 'children', 'were', 'born', 'raised', 'What', 'wrong', 'Nothing', 'Mr.', 'Sullivan', 'et', 'al', 'elected', 'position', 'Gilbert', 'war', 'perhaps', 'adventurous', 'element', 'book', 'facts', 'are', 'Anne', 'Gilbert', 'grown', 'sons', 'went', 'war', 'Gilbert', 'being', 'too', 'old', 'then', 'only', 'established', 'doctor', 'large', 'radius', 'Anne', 'never', 'lost', 'access', 'Green', 'Gables', 'did', 'run', 'down', 'shack', 'status', 'Diana', 'husband', 'marital', 'situation', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'books', 'are', 'needfully', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'go', 'entirely', 'new', 'circumstances.Credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'portrayals', 'overall', 'authenticity', 'character', 'development', 'offering', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'quality', 'performance', 'Ms', 'Follows', 'However', 'puzzling', 'deviation', 'books', 'series', 'merited', 'classic', 'Thus', 'four', 'stars', 'performance', 'development', 'character', 'withholding', 'fifth', 'due', 'disappointment', 'totally', 'invented', 'circumstances']",Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story VHS

549583,A969IRIB06EPC,B00004S8JT,ditty,"[17, 19]","As a huge Lucy Maud Montgomery/Anne of Green Gables fan, I truly enjoyed the first two Megan Follows Anne of Green Gables movies. The first movie stuck mostly to the book and was really wonderful. The second movie was a combination of several of the subsequent Anne books, and sticks less to the original stories but none the less is an enjoyable view and true to the books in most majorly important areas. The third movie was a bit of a disaster with plot, setting, and events totally fabricated and not at all from the books. YIKES! DO NOT READ ON IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW INFO ON THE ANNE OF GREEN GABLES BOOKS BEFORE FINISHING READING THEM YOURSELF. (Though I highly recommend reading all the books in the series before watching any movie versions.) In reality, Anne does not go on to do anything exceptional by the world's standards. Montgomery chooses NOT to have her go on to become a great author. Instead she becomes a loving wife and mommy and her adventures continue to be Anne-like and focus on meeting new people and winning them over with her unaltered charm. She enjoys some occasional match-making. She and Gilbert eventually have a rather large brood of children and are happy and content in the normal everydayness of life. The stories are really very sweet and satisfying but not exactly the greatest movie material. The last two novels (Rainbow Valley and Rilla of Ingleside) focus almost exclusively on the lives and times of her children. However, this third Megan Follows movie has Anne embarking on an adventure in wartime Europe in search of Gilbert who left for Europe shortly after their wedding. Anne meets up with Diana's husband, Fred, who has been wounded and joins Anne in her quest to find Gilbert. At one point, Fred subtly suggests that they give up the search for Gilbert and just become a family themselves. Okay...ICK!  It ends with Gilbert and Anne adopting a war baby who had been under Anne's charge while she was searching for her missing husband in Europe. They hand over Green Gables to Diana and her emotionally-wrecked husband and plan to settle elsewhere and raise the little boy as their own. Someone behind this movie has a very active imagination. It is almost all completely made up. The final book, Rilla of Ingleside, does take place during wartime, but Anne's sons, not her husband, go off to war. Her teenage daughter, Rilla, does help to raise an infant whose mother dies and whose father is away at war.  However, this does not result in any adoption as the baby's father eventually returns to claim him. If you don't mind its almost total departure from anything having to do with the books, I guess this film can be entertaining. I just think it is such a shame that many people fall in love with Anne after reading Anne of Green Gables but never read the rest of the books in the series. Then they watch the Megan Follows movies and are walking around this earth thinking that her story ends with a wartime adventure for Gilbert and Anne who then settle down to raise their adopted son! It's sad, really. The only way I would recommend someone to see this film is if they can't get enough of Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie and cannot rest until they see them get married on the screen, even if they event itself, and more significantly, the events that follow, are remarkably different from L.M. Montgomery's books. Do read all 8 Anne books and do see the first 2 Megan Follows movies.

But being a devoted fan of the books, I don't particularly care for any of the movies, especially the last two, because of the way that the characters, events, and settings were distorted at the whim of the producers. Anne of Green Gables was OK, because it followed the basic story line, but I was dissapointed with Anne of Avonlea, which left out wonderful characters in the books, and threw in people who didn't even exist, as well as combing elements from books 2,3, and 4 in the series. The last film was especially dissapointing.  To begin with, the settings were all wrong. Anne and Gilbert NEVER lived in, or even visited, New York, or anywhere else in America, for that matter. In the books, the time of Gilbert and Anne's courtship was set in the 1880s -- a peaceful, prosperous time. The turmoil of WWI came much later, when Anne's youngest daughter, Rilla, was a teenager, and Anne's three sons go away to fight in the war. The wedding scene was a dissapointment -- I think they should have been already married at the time the film began , or at least at the beginning of the movie, when times were happier. We had been waiting to see it for so long that it should have been a very joyous moment, but instead it was rushed and clouded with sorrow. Also, the story should have shown Anne and Gilbert's own children (or at least one or two of them) instead of an adopted war orphan who didn't even exist in the books.

Anne and Gilbert have a beautiful 7 year old named Faith Leanne they believe they are blessed to have her after loosing Dominick in a fire the day before he was to be offically adopted. So Anne finds out she is pregnant again and magically discovers that its a girl and faith is overjoyed to have a little sister but when Anne falls ill on the day of her labor her doctor urges Gilbert and Anne to take the train to London, England because the baby needs special treatment and if Anne births the baby before they reach the hospital in London that the baby will die without the proper medical treatment when Gilbert questions how long the ride is the doctor tilts his head down and saids 4 days but Anne is in labor still the parents decide to take the chance and travel to England that very day on the train ride Anne is having a difficult time trying not to deliever the baby on the way luckily they make it even though Anne delievers the baby they call Rilla at the hospital healthy and beautiful the doctor arrives with sad news... that is basically the story of my script Anne Of Green Gables: The Labor that should be publish if I can find the address to Sullivan Entertainment.

I knew they departed from LMM's books, but I was shocked to find out how much.  The story is loosely based on the last book in the Anne series, ""Rilla of Ingleside"", about Anne's youngest daughter during the First World War.  Being the only North American woman's written account of the war, it is a very famous book, and although fiction, has historical value.  In the book Anne & Gibert are middle-aged and the book centers around their young adult children, but the movie has Anne searching for Gilbert on the battle lines!  Of course Anne has a flirtation along the way even though she and Gilbert are married.  What were LMM's descendants thinking when they allowed this movie to be made!?The first two movies are splendid and are true to LMM's characters in ways that the third movie is not.  Although poetic license was used, especially in the 1st sequel, they went a bit further in this second sequel.  Anne didn't seem like Anne.  Gilbert and Diana were so thin they were almost unrecognizable.  How different was Megan Follows as Anne?  One of my friends commented to me that she had seen the movie and actually was under the impression that the actor who played Anne was not Megan Follows!!I think the most unforgiveable thing to me is how they portrayed Anne & Gilbert's wedding, which was so beautiful in the book ""Anne's House of Dreams""!My hope is that if Sullivan productions tackles such a project again that they present ""Anne's House of Dreams"", a wonderful story, and stick to the words that made LMM famous!

I was glad to see more of Anne and her life, and  I was prepared to see a story that didn't follow the books (this from reading the reviews).  I was just disappointed there wasn't more screen time for Anne and Gilbert together. I love watching these two actors portray their characters.  There is such chemistry between the two that they are enjoyable to watch.The whole tone of the movie was somber.  The war storyline was the focus of the movie and could be called the &quot;second character&quot;.  I would have liked to see the whole Anne-Gilbert wedding.  This was what I had hoped for in the two previous movies.  I think any Anne fan would want to see the whole wedding.This movie didn't seem to have the same quality as the other two Anne movies.  It seemed like something was missing.  Of course I realize it has been quite a few years between the sequel and this movie and it would have been impossible to get all the actors back to portray their characters, but it seemed like something was missing.  Maybe it was because Marilla was not in this movie.  She definitely was a presence in the first two.  Of course, I would rather Marilla not be in the movie than to have someone else replace Colleen Dewhurst.  That would have been horrible. She set the standard for Marilla.  No one else could have replaced her.If you want to see more of Anne, then watch this movie.  It isn't all bad. It is good to watch Anne and Gilbert.

There are still four more books in the Anne series that they haven't touched, they could easily have taken things from THEM, so why did they make this wishy-washy movie?

Bernabo,"[12, 13]","Having listened to Kevin Sullivan's commentary on the DVD versions of the first two &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series, I realized that he has a very poor conception of L. M. Montgomery's stories. That would explain the travesty of &quot;Anne of Green Gables III.&quot; As co-writer, Sullivan totally abandons Montgomery's work to spin his own melodramatic tale of World War I, even though the author's &quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot; deals with that same time frame. Of course, Anne is almost fifty years old by the time of that novel and it is a pair of her sons who go off to fight and die in the war. Montgomery's novel was published right after the end of the Great War, making it a uniquely contemporaneous work which richly deserves a film treatment. Maybe Sullivan objected to the novel's politics, in which the characters supported the war and the Empire, unlike Anne in this film, but who knows. Clearly they waited too long to get around to making this third part, since Anne and Gilbert should have been married long ago. Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie are basically twice as old as the characters they first portrayed in the original &quot;Anne.&quot; But while it is great to see these two playing Anne and Gilbert again, the story told here is just plain awful. There is no reason to tell the tale of a wife who goes looking for her husband in Europe using L. M. Montgomery's characters.The first two &quot;Anne&quot; series were filled with warm and wonderful moments that you enjoy viewing again and again. The only moments that stand out in this sorry affair are when Anne finally finds Gilbert and when she goes back to the train station where Matthew first found Anne so many years ago to give us a sense of having come back to where we started. Of course, a lot of our disappointment comes from the heighten expectation of finally getting to see our beloved characters on screen again. I know I am not the only one who has read everything written by L. M. Montgomery after seeing the first &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; program, so I know I am not alone in being bitterly disappointed by this production. Even worse, the storyline here effectively kills ever returning to Montgomery's original stories, unless we are to suddenly believe Anne's kids end up being old enough to fight World War II. Watching this is just such a depressing experience that you have to go back and read again the best parts of Montgomery's novels or watch the first two series again.

I absolutely loved the scenes between Ann and Gilbert and that alone made it worth the purchase. It was wonderful to see them so openly affectionate with each other.The chemistry between Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie was even better than Anne of Avonlea, perhaps because the two actors had matured as their characters had. It made Ann and Gilbert's love for each other palpable and very romantic. As Ann didn't hesitate to say, she was scandalously in love with him and I believed it.The storyline with Jack Garrison did not thrill me and when Ann tells him toward the end of the movie that she would always think of his son as theirs, it was very un-Ann like to me. It seemed as though she was being unfaithful to Gilbert in a small way. Maybe I'm picking nits, but it was the one scene I really disliked.On the plus side, many of the characters from the first two Ann movies made appearances and it was startling to see how much they'd aged. I do admit that I wish Rachel Lynde had been more a part of the story and was certainly surprised not to see her at Ann and Gilbert's wedding. And where were Gilbert's parent's?While I was disappointed that the movie didn't have a wedding night for Ann and Gilbert, because the scene was ultimately cut, it did show up in the extras as a deleted scene.

She just didn't feel like Anne anymore, in some area's there is a hint of her in that older lady, but just gone.  Also, she was around 17 or 18 in the last movie.  In this movie she would have been in her early 20's when married to Gill, and their characters looked so much older than they should have.  It was nice to see both actors back thou, and I do applaud Sullivan Entertainment for doing so.  It's just they should have made this movie sooner, than they did.Third - What was going on?  I felt stupid for not really getting the plot of the movie.  At one point she is holding a child, the next in a conspiracy that made no since.  Dumb one liners thought-out the whole movie, to the point she looked like she was about to kill a Nun for not telling her where her husband was. :-p it's all good, but could have been better.If you're like me, and never read the books, this show at least ends the Mini Series, and leaves no questions asked about Anne's relationship with Gill, or anything else.  Personally I wouldn't mind a reboot of the series with different actors.  Megan Follows was very good in the role, and I don't think there will hardly be anyone better, but the show could use an update, that way the third movie can be more like the book.  I gave this movie 4 stars only because it was not a bad movie, just not Anne in a way we knew her in the past movies.  If you didn't read the books, then you won't be vastly disappointed in the ending.",4,I never read the Books!!,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2472,"['First', 'am', 'guy', 'loved', 'story', 'Anne', 'liked', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'girlfriend', 'fainted', 'when', 'said', 'wanted', 'watch', 'never', 'seen', 'two', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'had', 'third', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'bought', 'as', 'fast', 'could.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'being', 'fan', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'see', 'ending', 'show', 'story', 'end', 'Mini', 'Series', 'not', 'books', 'So', 'once', 'understand', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'little', 'more.First', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'was', 'older', 'movie', 'still', 'looked', 'good', '-p', 'had', 'throw', 'manliness', 'review', 'somewhere', 'lol.Second', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'Anne', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'more', 'serious', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'made', 'grow', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'wished', 'see', 'Anne', 'enduring', 'traits', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'popular', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'had', 'imagination', 'movie', 'was', 'War', 'story', 'made', 'almost', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Anne', 'anymore', 'area', 'hint', 'older', 'lady', 'just', 'gone', 'Also', 'was', 'around', '17', '18', 'last', 'movie', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'early', '20', 'when', 'married', 'Gill', 'characters', 'looked', 'so', 'much', 'older', 'should', 'have', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'actors', 'back', 'thou', 'do', 'applaud', 'Sullivan', 'Entertainment', 'doing', 'so', 'just', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'sooner', 'did.Third', 'What', 'was', 'going', 'felt', 'stupid', 'not', 'really', 'getting', 'plot', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'holding', 'child', 'next', 'conspiracy', 'made', 'Dumb', 'one', 'whole', 'movie', 'point', 'looked', 'was', 'about', 'kill', 'Nun', 'not', 'telling', 'where', 'husband', 'was', '-p', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.If', ""'re"", 'never', 'read', 'books', 'show', 'least', 'Mini', 'Series', 'questions', 'asked', 'Anne', 'relationship', 'Gill', 'anything', 'else', 'Personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'reboot', 'series', 'different', 'actors', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'there', 'will', 'hardly', 'be', 'anyone', 'better', 'show', 'could', 'use', 'update', 'way', 'third', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'book', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'only', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'Anne', 'way', 'knew', 'past', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'vastly', 'disappointed', 'ending']",Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story VHS

Montgomery books. Meagan Follows IS Anne Shirley. When I found out that a third installment of the series was coming out, I could not wait. However, what I received left a very bad taste in my mouth. ""Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story"" was horrible! The story was terrible and did not live up to the previous installments that drew you in to the story. With this film, I really didn't care about the characters the way I had in the past. The only thing I did care about was the fact that Anne and Gil were FINALLY together, but was still disappointed by their rushed wedding - something I had been waiting for for a very long time. I don't think that we, as fans, had the opportunity to really enjoy their wedding the way we had always imagined we would. I also hated the fact that the character of Jack and his son, in a way, came between Anne and Gil. Sometimes I felt like Anne was cheating on Gil with her interactions with Jack. I wanted to see Anne and Gil have their own children and raise them in the wonderfully heartwarming way they were raised, not with all of the melodrama of WWI.I truly wish that a better ending to an extraodinary series could have been made, but I guess I'll make do with the first two movies. I can't say enough great things about those films!The only reason I am giving this film one star - I would like to give it zero - is because some of the original cast is back. It was great to see Anne, Gil, and Dianna once again!If you are a fan of ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea"" (aka ""Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel""), don't bother purchasing this last installment.

I had recently seen the first two movies and was thrilled to find out that there was a third!  I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. (I haven't read any of the books, although I'm going to read them all, now)So, right away I'm wondering what in the world happened to Megan Follows' voice...why is it so deep?  Is she a smoker? Why does she look and sound so much older???? Only 5 years are supposed to have gone by. By the end of the movie, Gilbert is gray at the temples!Then, the romance and chemistry between Gilbert and Anne is completely gone!  We had to wait for two whole movies before we get to see them share one kiss, and now, we find out, they've waited so long to get married that there is no thrill or chemistry left!I'm sure at that time and date, these two would NEVER go off to live in New York without being married!Why in the world has Green Gables disintegrated in 5 years?  Why does there have to be a fire at all?  Why is Diana unhappy, snooty and sending her kids to bed when it's broad daylight?  Why is she filthy rich and yet has to live at Green Gables after the war?It's RIDICULOUS to think that Anne would share an apartment with another married man (who happens to be her best friend's husband).  She has two questionable, borderline relationships after finally marrying Gilbert!  By the way, don't hold your breath waiting for the wedding, it's completely silly, unromantic and over in a flash. We don't even get to see them finish their wedding dance.Most of the movie Anne is running around, while the viewer is left wondering what in the world is going on...am I watching a ""war movie"" or what?  The movie is about war-war-war.  And of course Anne is running around carrying this baby who never stops crying (yet most of the time she is hiding and the crying never gives them away).  It's completely ridiculous!When Anne and Gilbert finally are reunited and they return home, it's a big nothing. All Anne cares about is whether the boy will remember her.  Of course it's totally goofy, but this kid (who is just as cute as a button) remembers her and runs into her open arms, which no child estranged from their caregiver for that long would ever do.  Actually, the kid was so cute it was the only part of the movie I could even think of watching again. (But I didn't.)How in the world could they do this to Anne and Gilbert?  I'm going to take the other reviewers' advice and read the books.  This movie depressed me for days. Don't buy it!  You will hate it!

I'd probably give it four stars if the two main characters weren't named Anne Shirley and Gilbert Blythe. But then that's the crux of the situation--it didn't have anything whatsoever to do with the Anne of Green Gables book series.It had most of the original cast from the 'Anne' films from the 80s (with the notable exception of Colleen Dewhurst, who died about six years ago), but honestly it had nothing to do with Anne of Green Gables. The only part of the movie that I recognized from the books was a mention near the end of Glen St. Mary. So for me, from the aspect of having been a huge fan of the Anne books and even of the first two movies for many years, this third installment was extremely disappointing. It did not portray the story you would expect from having read the books.On the other hand, this was a pretty good movie, as I've said. It was an original screenplay that accurately depicted the horrors of WWI and even if I didn't already know Anne and Gilbert's history, I think it would still have been a kind of a sweet love story. If you were to take this film and judge it for the merits of it's story, acting, and cinematography, you'd probably find that it was a worthwhile investment of your time because it really is a good film from that perspective. If you were to take this film and judge it on the merits of how true it was to the books, you'd probably give it a negative ten stars and think that L.M. Montgomery must be rolling over in her grave. So let me finish up by saying this: If you liked the previous two 'Anne' movies and are just curious to see, you know, how the actors look today and what kind of performance they'll give, then by all means you should see this film. If you really liked the books and can't stand the idea of any director defiling L.M. Montgomery's vision in any way, shape, or form, then stay far, far away from this movie, for you are destined to be greatly disappointed.",3,"Uh, um, Anne?",1029974400,"08 22, 2002",2002,2042,"['was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'stars', 'give', 'movie', 'two', 'issues', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'named', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'then', 'crux', 'situation', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'book', 'series.It', 'had', 'most', 'original', 'cast', ""'Anne"", 'films', '80s', 'notable', 'exception', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'who', 'died', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'honestly', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'recognized', 'books', 'was', 'mention', 'end', 'Glen', 'St.', 'Mary', 'So', 'aspect', 'having', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Anne', 'books', 'even', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'many', 'years', 'third', 'installment', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'did', 'not', 'portray', 'story', 'would', 'expect', 'having', 'read', 'books.On', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'said', 'was', 'original', 'screenplay', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'horrors', 'WWI', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'Anne', 'Gilbert', 'history', 'think', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'kind', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'were', 'take', 'film', 'judge', 'merits', 'story', 'acting', 'cinematography', ""'d"", 'probably', 'find', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'investment', 'time', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'perspective', 'were', 'take', 'film', 'judge', 'merits', 'how', 'true', 'was', 'books', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'negative', 'ten', 'stars', 'think', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'must', 'be', 'rolling', 'grave', 'let', 'finish', 'up', 'saying', 'liked', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'curious', 'see', 'know', 'how', 'actors', 'look', 'today', 'what', 'kind', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'give', 'then', 'means', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'books', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'idea', 'director', 'defiling', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'vision', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'then', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'movie', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'greatly', 'disappointed']",Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story VHS
549633,AV2UMS38TIILZ,B00004S8JT,Picky viewer,"[1, 12]","All though it doesn't follow the original books, ""Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story"" is definantly worth watching.It begins with our familiar and beloved character Anne, as she goes to New York with Gilbert to see about getting her book published and waits for him to finish his education. As the story progresses, Gil feels the tug and the responsability of war and soon asks Anne to marry him before he is shipped out as doctor in the Canadian army. Soon after he ships out, Gill is posted as missing. It is all Anne can do to stand by and not know if he is dead or alive. The story gains momentum as she suspensfully signs up for red cross and completes a secret mission while looking for Gil and taking care of an old back-stabbing aquaintance's child, and her best friends wounded husband.Needless to say, this movie has a lot going on. And I feel that it has a very fitting and heartwarming ending.The only thing that I thought was a little out of place, is that Anne and Gilbert didn't start the movie already married. I think that this would have made the continuity of all the stories flow a lot better. Because they are in there early 30's late 20's and facing mature situations, it is hard to think of them taking such a youthfull position as newlyweds.

Crawford,"[1, 1]","I knew that the reviews were bad here, but my daughter loved the first two films in this series and wanted the complete set for her collection.  Reluctantly, I got it for her, and my expectations - of the worst of the 3, a terrible film that almost ruins the whole concept -  were not disappointed.  Indeed, this film is so poorly scripted that I was shocked.  The actors are good, but even they could not save this.The plot is ridiculously convoluted and impossible to believe after a time.  Anne goes to NYC with Gilbert, but both of them experience terrible career setbacks.  Upon return to Avonlea, they set about restoring Green Gables during the patriotic fervor for WWI, as seemingly all of their friends are departing.  Gilbert decides he must go too, only to vanish.  Anne decides to go and find out what happened to him, setting off a series of adventures that leads to a ring of spies, innumerable ridiculously unbelievable coincidences, all amidst war where the bombs are falling nearby, other people fall for Anne, etc etc.  Not only does it not hold together, but there is virtually no development of interesting characters, not even the writer who betrays her.  Some promising characters make appearances, but no depth or flesh is added to the bones of their behavior.Beyond the plot, the spirit of the series is lost here.  There was something so urgent, so pressing about Anne's hopes and efforts, the blooming of her talents for friendship, love, and work - all the great signs of a healthy psychology - that are simply lacking in this film.  Even my daughter was laughing at it by the end, I am sorry to say.  She is glad to own it as it completes a collection, but I doubt we will want to watch this again.There is some advancement of the plot lines.  Anne's bosom companion is not in a very happy marriage.  They do get married and decide to move on.  Anne still writes and works.  Gilbert is also brilliant and with singular integrity.  Finally, WWI is portrayed fairly well.  But that is it and it is all so predictable.  There is also very little humor or discovery in thisNot recommended.

This movie was barely viewable.First off, it is supposed to be five years after the second movie, but the actors all look like they have aged 15 years (big shock considering the huge time difference between the making of the 2nd and 3rd films).  It also took me about 1/2 of the movie to reconcile the new deepness of Megan Follows voice with the Anne character (which probably wasn't helped by the fact I had just finished watching the first two movies).  I kept getting pulled out of the movie by the age lines every time a close-up of Anne or Gil appeared.Second, the relationship between Anne and Fred in London is just creepy.  And the way he looks at her at then end of the movie, with Diana happily preggers beside him, made feel like I needed to take a shower to wash away the ick.Third, I just didn't like this Anne at all.  She had zero of the dreamy-eyed drama queen quality that made me love the Anne character to begin with.  She was kinda smarmy in the beginning of the movie and I'm not so sure they didn't cut out some love scenes with Anne and Fred and Anne and Jack because I got the distinct feeling that, despite her 'must find Gilbert' mantra, she was not true to her wedding vows.Last, not enough of the Anne/Gilbert romance.  Come on...that was half of what sold the original two movies, the absolute certainty these two were soul mates!  Where was the wedding!  And why did it take five years to happen?  No way did the Anne and Gil from the first two movies wait five more years to marry!  And then him ship off with the ink barely dry on the marriage certificate, absolutely not!What was wrong with giving the fans what they wanted, more of Avonlea life with Anne and Gil as a young married couple?",1,Terrible,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,1925,"['finally', 'watched', 'Anne', 'movie', 'when', 'received', 'part', 'trilogy', 'box', 'set', 'What', 'disappointment', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'two', 'Anne', 'movies', 'tween', 'movie', 'was', 'barely', 'viewable.First', 'off', 'supposed', 'be', 'five', 'years', 'second', 'movie', 'actors', 'look', 'have', 'aged', '15', 'years', 'big', 'shock', 'considering', 'huge', 'time', 'difference', 'making', '2nd', '3rd', 'films', 'also', 'took', '1/2', 'movie', 'reconcile', 'new', 'deepness', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'voice', 'Anne', 'character', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'helped', 'fact', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'kept', 'getting', 'pulled', 'movie', 'age', 'lines', 'time', 'close-up', 'Anne', 'Gil', 'appeared.Second', 'relationship', 'Anne', 'Fred', 'London', 'just', 'creepy', 'way', 'then', 'end', 'movie', 'Diana', 'happily', 'preggers', 'made', 'feel', 'needed', 'take', 'shower', 'wash', 'away', 'ick.Third', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Anne', 'had', 'zero', 'dreamy-eyed', 'drama', 'queen', 'quality', 'made', 'love', 'Anne', 'character', 'begin', 'was', 'kinda', 'smarmy', 'beginning', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'out', 'love', 'scenes', 'Anne', 'Fred', 'Anne', 'Jack', 'got', 'distinct', 'feeling', ""'must"", 'find', 'Gilbert', 'mantra', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'wedding', 'vows.Last', 'not', 'enough', 'Anne/Gilbert', 'romance', 'Come', 'was', 'half', 'what', 'sold', 'original', 'two', 'movies', 'absolute', 'certainty', 'two', 'were', 'soul', 'mates', 'Where', 'was', 'wedding', 'why', 'did', 'take', 'five', 'years', 'happen', 'way', 'did', 'Anne', 'Gil', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'wait', 'five', 'more', 'years', 'marry', 'then', 'ship', 'off', 'ink', 'barely', 'dry', 'marriage', 'certificate', 'absolutely', 'not', 'What', 'was', 'wrong', 'giving', 'fans', 'what', 'wanted', 'more', 'Avonlea', 'life', 'Anne', 'Gil', 'young', 'married', 'couple']",Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story VHS
549651,A14NPYRHG8EGR9,B00004S8JT,"Wilderness ""wilderness1111""","[1, 1]","In one of the early scenes in this movie, the main character, Anne Shirley spots her  beloved Gilbert from the beach and runs to greet him...only to do an epic faceplant in the sand.  This pretty much sums up this movie.  It strives and yet falls flat on its face repeatedly. It was an ill-conceived attempt to further cash in on the Anne franchise.  Unlike the first two parts of this ""trilogy"" of movies, this story is original and not truly based on the works of Montgomery at all.  Even overlooking that, the story is weak at best and reminiscent of an early soap opera or the worst of Danielle Steele.  Characterization is lacking.  Gone is the polyannish girl with red hair who would illuminate people's hearts with her flair for the dramatic and her love of words.  We are given in her stead a generic female protagonist who lives in fear and whose only real drive is to reunite with her husband--she could just as easily be a grown Nancy Drew.  The writing was stilted at the best of times, so it is a credit to the extraordinary acting abilities of Megan Fellows et al. that they were able to deliver some of these lines without choking on the cheese.  The Magic of Green Gables (and Avonlea in general) was that it was an archetypal Home.  It was a place where the pies were always hot and hearts were always glad.  This movie begins with a violation of that, so it begins on a note of betrayal. It continues in that spirit with the addition of adult subplots that have no real business in a young adult movie (marital difficulties, ethical dilemmas, hospital politics...)  I have given this movie a rating of two stars because as usual the acting was superb and it was just barely enough to pull this movie from the edge of the cliff.",2,Flat...flat...flat,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,1745,"['one', 'early', 'scenes', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'spots', 'beloved', 'Gilbert', 'beach', 'greet', 'only', 'do', 'epic', 'faceplant', 'sand', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'movie', 'yet', 'flat', 'face', 'repeatedly', 'was', 'ill-conceived', 'attempt', 'further', 'cash', 'Anne', 'franchise', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'trilogy', 'movies', 'story', 'original', 'not', 'truly', 'based', 'works', 'Montgomery', 'Even', 'overlooking', 'story', 'weak', 'best', 'reminiscent', 'early', 'soap', 'opera', 'worst', 'Danielle', 'Steele', 'Characterization', 'lacking', 'Gone', 'polyannish', 'girl', 'red', 'hair', 'who', 'would', 'illuminate', 'people', 'hearts', 'flair', 'dramatic', 'love', 'words', 'are', 'given', 'stead', 'generic', 'female', 'protagonist', 'who', 'fear', 'only', 'real', 'drive', 'reunite', 'husband', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'grown', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'writing', 'was', 'stilted', 'best', 'times', 'credit', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Megan', 'Fellows', 'et', 'al', 'were', 'able', 'deliver', 'lines', 'choking', 'cheese', 'Magic', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Avonlea', 'general', 'was', 'was', 'archetypal', 'Home', 'was', 'place', 'where', 'pies', 'were', 'always', 'hot', 'hearts', 'were', 'always', 'glad', 'movie', 'violation', 'note', 'betrayal', 'spirit', 'addition', 'adult', 'subplots', 'have', 'real', 'business', 'young', 'adult', 'movie', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'ethical', 'dilemmas', 'hospital', 'politics', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'rating', 'two', 'stars', 'usual', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'just', 'barely', 'enough', 'pull', 'movie', 'edge', 'cliff']",Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story VHS

549653,A8LD0D4RVJJ1N,B00004S8JT,Zarah Mayes-Horowitz,"[12, 15]","Having enjoyed the first two installments of the Anne saga, I was deeply disappointed with ""The Continuing Story.""I expected to be re-introduced to the characters that I came to love. I expected to feel the same warmth and delight unique to the first two Kevin Sullivan films. Instead I found next to nothing reminiscent of Anne of Green Gables or Anne of Avonlea.  The story was moved from Prince Edward Island and relocated to war-riddled Europe in the midst of calamity and conflict.  Gilbert is sent to war and ends up missing in action.  Anne spends 90% of the movie searching for him amidst bombings, wounded soldiers, orphaned children, and every other depressing scenario peculiar to a war zone.  This is too big of a departure from the series and from the sequel long expected by Anne of Green Gables fans.  If Sullivan had wanted to make a war film, he should have done that, however, absent the Green Gables franchise.I expected first of all that the setting would remain in Canada...Prince Edward Island, Halifax, etc.  Secondly, although I, quite naturally, expected Anne to have matured, I thought I'd still see the same irrepressible, colorful Anne that made her such a delightful character.  Instead she wanders through Europe on a search for Gilbert; and set against the gray and melancholy backdrop of war, there's no opportunity for her to be the quaint and eloquent Anne we came to know and love.Sullivan's first two Anne films were perfect ""feel good"" family movies, but he strayed too far from a flawless formula with this one.  This movie was depressing, long, and cumbersome.  Since the essential elements in this film are so far removed from the first two Anne adventures, it, therefore, can not be considered a sequel or a continuing story. Nevertheless, in the end Sullivan takes us back to Avonlea, and we find that Green Gables is in ruins; and although there's some semblance of Anne's former home, we don't feel that we've returned to Green Gables.This movie lacks the warmth, the imagination, the beautiful scenery, the amusing dialogue, and the uniqueness of the characters that Lucy Maud Montgomery created.",1,A Huge Disappointment,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,2141,"['Having', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'Anne', 'saga', 'was', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'Continuing', 'Story', 'expected', 'be', 're-introduced', 'characters', 'came', 'love', 'expected', 'feel', 'same', 'warmth', 'delight', 'unique', 'first', 'two', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'films', 'Instead', 'found', 'next', 'nothing', 'reminiscent', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Anne', 'Avonlea', 'story', 'was', 'moved', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'relocated', 'war-riddled', 'Europe', 'midst', 'calamity', 'conflict', 'Gilbert', 'sent', 'war', 'up', 'missing', 'action', 'Anne', '90', '%', 'movie', 'searching', 'amidst', 'bombings', 'wounded', 'soldiers', 'orphaned', 'children', 'other', 'depressing', 'scenario', 'peculiar', 'war', 'zone', 'too', 'big', 'departure', 'series', 'sequel', 'long', 'expected', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'fans', 'Sullivan', 'had', 'wanted', 'make', 'war', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'however', 'absent', 'Green', 'Gables', 'franchise.I', 'expected', 'first', 'setting', 'would', 'remain', 'Canada', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'Halifax', 'etc', 'Secondly', 'quite', 'naturally', 'expected', 'Anne', 'have', 'matured', 'thought', ""'d"", 'still', 'see', 'same', 'irrepressible', 'colorful', 'Anne', 'made', 'such', 'delightful', 'character', 'Instead', 'Europe', 'search', 'Gilbert', 'set', 'gray', 'melancholy', 'backdrop', 'war', 'opportunity', 'be', 'quaint', 'eloquent', 'Anne', 'came', 'know', 'love.Sullivan', 'first', 'two', 'Anne', 'films', 'were', 'perfect', 'feel', 'good', 'family', 'movies', 'strayed', 'too', 'far', 'flawless', 'formula', 'one', 'movie', 'was', 'depressing', 'long', 'cumbersome', 'essential', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'first', 'two', 'Anne', 'adventures', 'therefore', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'sequel', 'continuing', 'story', 'Nevertheless', 'end', 'Sullivan', 'back', 'Avonlea', 'find', 'Green', 'Gables', 'ruins', 'semblance', 'Anne', 'former', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'returned', 'Green', 'Gables.This', 'movie', 'warmth', 'imagination', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'amusing', 'dialogue', 'uniqueness', 'characters', 'Lucy', 'Maud', 'Montgomery', 'created']",Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story VHS
