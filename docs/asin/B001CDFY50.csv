1175905,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B001CDFY50,A. Estes,"[3, 3]","From executive producer Quentin Tarantino comes ""Hell Ride,"" a throw-back biker flick/vehicle for Larry Bishop, who not only serves as the lead in the film, but also steps up to the plate as writer/director. The film follows the exploits of a hardened clan of bikers known as The Victors whose penchant for booze, women and good old fashioned revenge seems to have bonded them for life.Bishop, along with his co-stars Michael Madsen and Eric Balfour, manages to conjure up enough charisma in spite of poorly written characters and the cringe-worthy dialog they are forced to spew. Here is where the Tarantino touch would have saved the film, but alas, the famed director's involvement appears to be limited to providing funding and promotion for the film, rather than actually helping to nurse it along. Bishop does the wholeGrindhouse/Tarantino/Rodriguez schtick well enough on the surface; the film looks good and has a vibrant soundtrack, but not much else. What the film lacks is true charm and appeal, not to mention, a cohesive or even mildly interesting plot.Bit parts from the likes of David Carradine and Dennis Hopper may serve to shake you out of the semi-comatose state the film lulls you into, but neither character do much to improve or advance the story. It's almost as if they are there for us to say ""Hey, look! Dennis Hopper! Neat!"" rather than having the actors put to good use. In the end, ""Hell Ride"" is all style and no substance. There's lots of eye-candy -- from the babes to the bikes -- but not enough plot to go around, even for it's miniscule 80 minute running time, which still makes for a ride that goes on way too long.",2,Running on Empty.,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,1650,"['executive', 'producer', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Hell', 'Ride', 'throw-back', 'biker', 'flick/vehicle', 'Larry', 'Bishop', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'lead', 'film', 'also', 'up', 'plate', 'writer/director', 'film', 'exploits', 'hardened', 'clan', 'bikers', 'known', 'Victors', 'penchant', 'booze', 'women', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'revenge', 'have', 'bonded', 'life.Bishop', 'co-stars', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Eric', 'Balfour', 'conjure', 'up', 'enough', 'charisma', 'spite', 'poorly', 'written', 'characters', 'cringe-worthy', 'dialog', 'are', 'forced', 'spew', 'Here', 'where', 'Tarantino', 'touch', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'film', 'alas', 'famed', 'director', 'involvement', 'be', 'limited', 'providing', 'funding', 'promotion', 'film', 'rather', 'actually', 'helping', 'nurse', 'along', 'Bishop', 'wholeGrindhouse/Tarantino/Rodriguez', 'schtick', 'well', 'enough', 'surface', 'film', 'good', 'vibrant', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'What', 'film', 'true', 'charm', 'appeal', 'not', 'mention', 'cohesive', 'even', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'plot.Bit', 'parts', 'likes', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'may', 'serve', 'shake', 'semi-comatose', 'state', 'film', 'neither', 'character', 'do', 'much', 'improve', 'advance', 'story', 'almost', 'are', 'there', 'say', 'Hey', 'look', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Neat', 'rather', 'having', 'actors', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'end', 'Hell', 'Ride', 'style', 'substance', 'lots', 'eye-candy', 'babes', 'bikes', 'not', 'enough', 'plot', 'go', 'around', 'even', 'miniscule', '80', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'still', 'ride', 'way', 'too', 'long']",Hell Ride

It even has a serviceable backstory. But the execution was lackluster. One gang takes out some of their guys. Their guys retaliate, then the first gang takes out some more of the other guys. Lather, rinse, repeat. Larry Bishop's acting has two moves: 1) lower the chin and 2) glare. Michael Madsen has a really cool character- The Gent, a 1%er who wears his colors on a tuxedo jacket- but he spends most of the movie stuck with some really sophomoric dialogue. Not his fault. Also, it seems all the killing maiming and multiple shootings go completely unnoticed by police or the public at large. And it helps when you're screaming up and down the road on motorcycles to have the roads to yourself- no other traffic at all- regardless of the time of day or night.On the other hand, the DVD cost me less than $5.

1175910,A3K1JFYC9KOVV5,B001CDFY50,CB,"[0, 0]","It's not a great movie, certainly, but Hell Ride has one important thing going for it - it's hard not to like it, despite its faults.Here's the ""plot"" (such as it is): Pistolero (Larry Bishop) is the president of the Victors motorcycle gang, on a quest for vengeance against the leaders of a rival gang who are trying to muscle into his territory and who, 30 years ago, killed the woman he loved. He is joined in his quest by fellow Victors the Gent (Michael Madsen), Comanche (Eric Balfour) and Dennis Hopper, as they ride across the southwest seeking their enemies and rooting out traitors.This movie is basically everything you'd expect from a ""Grindhouse""-style picture produced by, you guessed it, the Weinsteins and Quentin Tarantino - lots of violence, some witty dialogue, and self-conscious Z-grade schlockiness. And it has certainly earned it's ""R"" rating, to be sure. However, the film - which, admittedly, is pretty hard to follow, and there is no plot at all to speak of, really - never loses its sense of crowd-pleasing fun.

1175911,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001CDFY50,Chris Pandolfi,"[12, 24]","Kick starting the supposed plot of ""Hell Ride"" is the murder of a woman. Back in the 1970s, the leader of a biker gang slashed her throat before dowsing her in gasoline and setting her on fire. Watching this scene, I'm wondering why the filmmakers couldn't make up their minds--you can slash her throat or you can burn her, but there's really no need to do both. I'm not one for overkill. The film, on the other hand, is; ""Hell Ride"" is not so much a story of feuding bikers as it is a series of death scenes, each so brutal, we're too shocked to realize that we're watching nothing of value or skill. Once we finally start paying attention, it becomes painfully obvious that writer, director, and star Larry Bishop wanted to make nothing more than a sleazy exploitation film, something that bursts at the seams with violence and language and nudity. A film isn't worth recommending just because it plays true to its genre. And a genre isn't worth defending if the point is to be ugly and nihilistic.""Hell Ride"" divides its unlikable characters into two categories: the bad guys we're supposed to root for, and the bad guys we're not supposed to root for. The former can be found in a biker gang called the Victors, led by Pistolero (Bishop). For the past thirty-two years, he's been on a mission to track down and destroy everyone involved in the murder of his old lady, Cherokee Kisum (Julia Jones), who met her gruesome end on July 4, 1976, the Bicentennial. He knows who was responsible--the members of Six Six Six, a rival biker gang. Armed with guns, knives, and a mysterious key to a hidden safety deposit box, Pistolero and his posse cruise through the American Southwestern deserts, knowing they're getting closer to the two most important members of Six Six Six: the suspiciously British-sounding Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) and the head honcho, Deuce (David Carradine).As you've probably noticed, everyone in this movie is given some clever nicknames, which are no doubt supposed to make us think of the gritty motorcycle films from the 1970s. On the Victors' side, there's The Gent (Michael Madsen), so named because he dons a tuxedo coat and a frilly white shirt instead of a leather jacket. There's also Comanche (Eric Balfour), a young hothead Pistolero believes witnessed Cherokee's murder as a kid. And then there's Eddie Zero, played by Dennis Hopper; this character serves no real purpose other than paying homage to Hopper's early career in motorcycle films. All live by Pistolero's Three B's philosophy: Bikes, Beer, and Booty. The film does pretty much the same thing. In fact, it makes more of an effort in when it comes to the last item on the list; there are enough naked and half-naked women in this movie to start a division of softcore pornography.One of these women is Nada (Leonor Varela), a part-time information gatherer and full-time nymphomaniac. She walks around like a flirt in a bad adult movie, rubbing, prodding, and caressing her body to Pistolero as she begs him for sex. She somehow manages to make Bishop's B-movie dialogue sound even worse, not helped by the fact that every conversation with her is a litany of sexual innuendos and biker clich&eacute;s. Example: when Nada subtly suggests that not--ahem--sleeping with her will send Pistolero to hell, Pistolero nonchalantly replies, ""Baby, I'm already in hell."" Another example: when Pistolero hands Nada a draft of his 666-page novel, the two engage in a lively discussion about fire departments and fire hoses and various body parts burning with desire. I guess it wasn't silly enough that a grimy, murderous biker actually took the time to write a novel, making sure it was exactly 666 pages.Is this what passes for filmmaking nowadays? Are we actually supposed to take this exploitive piece of trash seriously? This is the kind of film that wouldn't even appeal to diehard fans of blood-soaked B movies; it lacks the campy charm of those old grindhouse standards, relying instead on a plot that makes no sense, violence that doesn't serve the story, and dialogue that would embarrass even the worst pulp fiction writers. I was surprised to see Quentin Tarantino's name attached to this project as the executive producer; even if he does have a place in his heart for schlocky movies, I seriously doubt they were made as badly as ""Hell Ride.""And then there's the ending, which is so grotesquely anticlimactic that I wondered whether a reel of film was missing. Not that I would have cared much; I knew this movie was a lost cause less than five minutes into it, during a scene in which a fellow member of the Victors is buried in the desert; each member walk over the open grave, tossing half-finished bottles of beer onto the coffin. A sign of respect, no doubt. It's probably the only shred of respect the film has to offer. ""Hell Ride"" is unbelievably bad, a vile, poorly written, mean-spirited film that just doesn't know when to quit. And yes, I get that it's supposed to be that way. I get that it's a throwback to the gritty biker films of yesteryear, meant for fans of the genre. The thing is, I don't think even they will like this movie. To really appreciate anything about ""Hell Ride,"" you have to appreciate films made by people with no discernable talent. If you do, then I really feel sorry for you.",1,Bad to the Bone,1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,5311,"['Kick', 'starting', 'supposed', 'plot', 'Hell', 'Ride', 'murder', 'woman', 'Back', '1970s',

1175914,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001CDFY50,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 1]","HELL RIDEQuentin Tarantino once again provides us with one of the most entertaining films to come out in a long while, of course most credit should go to writer/director/producer/star Larry Bishop. I found this film to be one of the most enjoyable films I have watched in a while mainly due to the characters, T&A;, and over all feel of the film. This is a throwback to the old biker flicks in which Larry Bishop was once apart of. For those wondering how Tarantino is involved just has to watch the special features or listen to the commentary, turns out this film literally came about because of him. Larry got a call one day from a woman [who produces on this] who was standing right next to Quentin as he was speaking about Larry and his old films. Next thing you know Larry is at Quentin's house watching old movies and gets the news from Quentin that he apparently is destined to write and direct the greatest biker movie of all time.So once he heard that he went work on the script and started filming this excellent movie with a brilliant cast. Larry himself stars in this as Pistolero the leader of a biker gang that seems to be going extinct. Larry does a great job with his character and is kind of an evil guy wrapped in a nice guy if that makes any sense at all. Along for the ride is one Michael Madsen as The Gent a smooth type of guy that is real laid back but very dangerous. This seems like a part Madsen was born to play and honestly I have not liked him this much since QT's ""Reservoir Dogs"", no lie. Eric Balfour is great as Comanche the young buck of the group who seems to have a bone to pick but all is not what it seems. And then there is Dennis Hopper who plays Eddie Zero the veteran of the group who apparently has died many a time and no body seems to know who he is or how he is alive. All of them along side a couple of other guys in the group do wonderful jobs in this film and seemed like they had a great time doing it.On the opposite side of things is a rival gang that is out to kill every one headed by the great David Carradine as The Deuce. As one would expect he is great in the film but he meets a rather bad ending, but he has a crazy young guy out on the loose named Billy Wings played by Vinnie Jones. He is crazy in this movie and really a nasty guy, I loved his character. Every one in this film do a magnificent job especially all the women in the film, rally wonderful performances. Plus it does not hurt that they all look amazing and one in particular gets you all heated up with out taking any clothes off, what a good time.The film follows a group of bikers trying to survive a little war with another group who keeps blowing every one away. Along the way we learn of a young Indian woman that had a child that literally is the key to what every one is looking for. That is literally the over all summary of the film, but trust me this movie is very entertaining. I had a great time watching this movie with my brother and girl back when this was first released. I have no doubts you will as well.As for those who want cool bikes, T&A;, and lots of guns this is the movie for you no doubt about it. All of those things listed above are all over this movie as well as some wonderful shots and locations out in the desert. Add in some really wonderful scenes and some fascinating characters and you have one fun movie. I recommend this to all out there looking for a good time, buy it don't rent it. The film was wonderfully shot and looks much like a Tarantino film and features characters you would find in his films as well. If you are a fan of biker flicks, QT's films, or just a film buff you will enjoy this.There are some wonderful behind the scenes features on this excellent disc and it comes with one of the most informative commentaries ever.",5,"QUENTIN TARANTINO, T&A, GUNS, AND BIKES - SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME",1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,3803,"['HELL', 'RIDEQuentin', 'Tarantino', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'long', 'while', 'course', 'most', 'credit', 'should', 'go', 'writer/director/producer/star', 'Larry', 'Bishop', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'have', 'watched', 'while', 'mainly', 'due', 'characters', 'T', 'A', 'feel', 'film', 'throwback', 'old', 'biker', 'flicks', 'Larry', 'Bishop', 'was', 'once', 'apart', 'wondering', 'how', 'Tarantino', 'involved', 'just', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'listen', 'commentary', 'out', 'film', 'literally', 'came', 'Larry', 'got', 'call', 'one', 'day', 'woman', '[', 'who', ']', 'who', 'was', 'standing', 'right', 'next', 'Quentin', 'was', 'speaking', 'Larry', 'old', 'films', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'Larry', 'Quentin', 'house', 'watching', 'old', 'movies', 'news', 'Quentin', 'apparently', 'destined', 'write', 'direct', 'greatest', 'biker', 'movie', 'time.So', 'once', 'heard', 'went', 'work', 'script', 'started', 'filming', 'excellent', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'Larry', 'Pistolero', 'leader', 'biker', 'gang', 'be', 'going', 'extinct', 'Larry', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'kind', 'evil', 'guy', 'wrapped', 'nice', 'guy', 'sense', 'ride', 'one', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Gent', 'smooth', 'type', 'guy', 'real', 'laid', 'back', 'very', 'dangerous', 'part', 'Madsen', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'honestly', 'have', 'not', 'liked', 'much', 'QT', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'lie', 'Eric', 'Balfour', 'great', 'Comanche', 'young', 'buck', 'group', 'who', 'have', 'bone', 'pick', 'not', 'what', 'then', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'who', 'Eddie', 'Zero', 'veteran', 'group', 'who', 'apparently', 'died', 'many', 'time', 'body', 'know', 'who', 'how', 'alive', 'side', 'couple', 'other', 'guys', 'group', 'do', 'wonderful', 'jobs', 'film', 'seemed', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'doing', 'it.On', 'opposite', 'side', 'things', 'rival', 'gang', 'out', 'kill', 'one', 'headed', 'great', 'David', 'Carradine', 'Deuce', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'great', 'film', 'rather', 'bad', 'ending', 'crazy', 'young', 'guy', 'loose', 'named', 'Billy', 'Wings', 'played', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'crazy', 'movie', 'really', 'nasty', 'guy', 'loved', 'character', 'one', 'film', 'do', 'magnificent', 'job', 'especially', 'women', 'film', 'rally', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'not', 'hurt', 'look', 'amazing', 'one', 'particular', 'heated', 'up', 'out', 'taking', 'clothes', 'off', 'what', 'good', 'time.The', 'film', 'group', 'bikers', 'trying', 'survive', 'little', 'war', 'group', 'who', 'blowing', 'one', 'away', 'way', 'learn', 'young', 'Indian', 'woman', 'had', 'child', 'literally', 'key', 'what', 'one', 'looking', 'literally', 'summary', 'film', 'trust', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'brother', 'girl', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'have', 'doubts', 'will', 'well.As', 'who', 'want', 'cool', 'bikes', 'T', 'A', 'lots', 'guns', 'movie', 'doubt', 'things', 'listed', 'are', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'wonderful', 'shots', 'locations', 'out', 'desert', 'Add', 'really', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'have', 'one', 'fun', 'movie', 'recommend', 'there', 'looking', 'good', 'time', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'film', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'shot', 'much', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'characters', 'would', 'find', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'fan', 'biker', 'flicks', 'QT', 'films', 'just', 'film', 'buff', 'will', 'enjoy', 'are', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'features', 'excellent', 'disc', 'one', 'most', 'informative', 'commentaries', 'ever']",Hell Ride

Bishop follows Tarantino's formula with kitschy music, story out of order and plenty of ""witty"" dialouge from the main players, but none of it is done well. The setting, which seems to be irrelvent in Tarantino's world revolves around bikers that...wait for it..don't trust each other or their rivals!

What makes these films so great is that the original ideas started out serious. These thoughts and actions were written down on paper for one reason only: to put this on film no matter the cost. The low budget aspect is what made these the grindhouse films of the era. They couldn't afford special effects, stunt drivers and high paid professional actors and yet they tried their best and made the films that held on to become the cult classics of today.Hell Ride, written & directed by Larry Bishop, is completely opposite. It was an original, moderate budget, idea that wanted to do a tribute to the low budget motorcycle genre of yesterday. So how does one make such a film?1. Great cast - There is a difference between bad acting and purposly taking the fall. In this movie you can clearly tell they are trying too hard to act awful.2. Intriging Plot - With constant script repeats and quick clips that made absolutely no sense, Larry Biship has now earned a spot next to Uwe Boll.3. Beautiful Women - There were more breasts than plot and action in this movie. I could've switched over to Cinemax and saved myself $13.00 if I wanted to watch soft porn.4. Overall Perfection - Vinnie Jones, bad guy, has a total of 9 minutes in the film (they cut out 20 minutes of him to add more breasts) and Carradine has a minor roll which makes sense at first then doesn't. I'm ashamed to see Tarantino's name in this. I know he has money but at least have some pride.In a nut shell: Bikers, spear guns, slutty bar maids and awful acting all go together in this straight to video movie that should have gone straight to the incinerator.

1175927,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001CDFY50,Mark Turner,"[6, 9]","It seems a large number of viewers have missed the point on the film HELL RIDE. Many have gone online to proclaim just how bad the movie is. But chances are that those doing so missed the point. The movie isn't nearly as simplistic as it seems on the surface. It isn't about looking cool. And while it tries to breathe new life into the biker film genre, its roots are deeper than that.Larry Bishop directs, writes and stars in the film as Pistolero, the head of a biker gang known as The Victors. The gang has seen better days and unrest lies within its members as their age old rivals, the Six Six Sixers, are attempting to take over their turf. The bad blood between the two gangs has been brewing some time, with initial problems begun with the death of a young woman named Cherokee Kissum (Julia Jones).The main members of the Victors are Pistolero who swaggers and oozes cool while at the same time containing a venomous wrath that isn't fulfilled till films end. Alongside him is his right hand man, The Gent (Michael Madsen). The Gent is an odd one, filled with psychotic, subtle rage that lets loose on occasion while at the same time offering a more sophisticated person among the more stereotypical bikers. Lastly is Comanchee (Eric Balfour), the young gun moving up in the gang quickly, Pistolero's new favorite brought in by The Gent. The rest of the gang is there as well but as they begin to show signs of disloyalty, their numbers dwindle.The set up is simple. Flashbacks to the past and the murder of Cherokee Kissum result in a truce of sorts that is just now being broken nearly 30 years later. The leaders of the Six Six Sixers are Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones), a truly societal reject if there ever was one, who intends to kill every Victor he comes in contact with. The main man in charge though is The Deuce (David Carradine), rarely seen and yet pivotal in the main storyline. Between the killings brought on by Billy and Pistolero, team Victors drops down to just three.Along the way we are able to meet the women in the lives of the gang, nothing more than playthings to each with the possible exception of Nada (Leonor Varela). While being used for information, there is a bond between her and Pistolero that even he won't acknowledge.Just who killed Cherokee Kissum, and why, is what sets the whole ball in motion. The face offs are more due to this moment in time than they are to the current battle for turf. Behind her story lies a revenge motive that breaks all ties and results in a promise made to her finally fulfilled.This confrontation is the result of what happened years ago. If you don't figure it out by mid-film then you haven't seen enough movies. Just who is who and what was it that brought about a bloodbath because of it can be seen coming. But the trip their, the hell ride, makes it a curious travel indeed.Bishop cut his teeth in biker films having had parts in THE SAVAGE SEVEN, THE DEVIL'S 8, ANGEL UNCHAINED and CHROME AND HOT LEATHER. He knows the genre well. But the film doesn't rest in that genre nearly as much as it does the revenge fueled spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s. This film grows on you, revealing itself after you watch it.The movie is definitely not for children having its fill of nudity and relative soft core moments. The violence is seen throughout and seems more day to day for the characters involved than one would hope to live through. There are no heroes here, just anti-heroes. Men who do the right thing, perhaps, for the wrong reasons. Men who brutally take justice into their own hands yet at the same time do things just as bad as those they face. In the end, a somewhat happy ending occurs. But at the same time it's not the end you deal with here, it's the ride.",4,TAKE THE RIDE,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,3752,"['large', 'number', 'viewers', 'have', 'missed', 'point', 'film', 'HELL', 'RIDE', 'Many', 'have', 'gone', 'online', 'proclaim', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'chances', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'missed', 'point', 'movie', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'simplistic', 'surface', ""n't"", 'looking', 'cool', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'biker', 'film', 'genre', 'roots', 'are', 'deeper', 'that.Larry', 'Bishop', 'writes', 'stars', 'film', 'Pistolero', 'head', 'biker', 'gang', 'known', 'Victors', 'gang', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'unrest', 'lies', 'members', 'age', 'old', 'rivals', 'Six', 'Six', 'Sixers', 'are', 'attempting', 'take', 'over', 'turf', 'bad', 'blood', 'two', 'gangs', 'been', 'brewing', 'time', 'initial', 'problems', 'begun', 'death', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Cherokee', 'Kissum', 'Julia', 'Jones', '.The', 'main', 'members', 'Victors', 'are', 'Pistolero', 'who', 'swaggers', 'cool', 'same', 'time', 'containing', 'venomous', 'wrath', ""n't"", 'fulfilled', 'till', 'films', 'end', 'Alongside', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Gent', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Gent', 'odd', 'one', 'filled', 'psychotic', 'subtle', 'rage', 'loose', 'occasion', 'same', 'time', 'offering', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'person', 'more', 'stereotypical', 'bikers', 'Lastly', 'Comanchee', 'Eric', 'Balfour', 'young', 'gun', 'moving', 'up', 'gang', 'quickly', 'Pistolero', 'new', 'favorite', 'brought', 'Gent', 'rest', 'gang', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'begin', 'show', 'signs', 'disloyalty', 'numbers', 'dwindle.The', 'set', 'up', 'simple', 'Flashbacks', 'past', 'murder', 'Cherokee', 'Kissum', 'result', 'truce', 'sorts', 'just', 'now', 'being', 'broken', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'later', 'leaders', 'Six', 'Six', 'Sixers', 'are', 'Billy', 'Wings', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'truly', 'societal', 'reject', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'kill', 'Victor', 'contact', 'main', 'man', 'charge', 'though', 'Deuce', 'David', 'Carradine', 'rarely', 'seen', 'yet', 'pivotal', 'main', 'storyline', 'killings', 'brought', 'Billy', 'Pistolero', 'team', 'Victors', 'drops', 'down', 'just', 'three.Along', 'way', 'are', 'able', 'meet', 'women', 'lives', 'gang', 'nothing', 'more', 'playthings', 'possible', 'exception', 'Nada', 'Leonor', 'Varela', 'being', 'used', 'information', 'bond', 'Pistolero', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'acknowledge.Just', 'who', 'killed', 'Cherokee', 'Kissum', 'why', 'what', 'whole', 'ball', 'motion', 'face', 'offs', 'are', 'more', 'due', 'moment', 'time', 'are', 'current', 'battle', 'turf', 'story', 'revenge', 'motive', 'ties', 'results', 'promise', 'made', 'finally', 'fulfilled.This', 'confrontation', 'result', 'what', 'happened', 'years', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'mid-film', 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enough', 'movies', 'Just', 'who', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'brought', 'bloodbath', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'coming', 'trip', 'hell', 'ride', 'curious', 'travel', 'indeed.Bishop', 'cut', 'teeth', 'biker', 'films', 'having', 'had', 'parts', 'THE', 'SAVAGE', 'SEVEN', 'THE', 'DEVIL', '8', 'ANGEL', 'UNCHAINED', 'CHROME', 'AND', 'HOT', 'LEATHER', 'genre', 'well', 'film', ""n't"", 'rest', 'genre', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'revenge', 'fueled', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', '60s', '70s', 'film', 'revealing', 'watch', 'it.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', 'having', 'fill', 'nudity', 'relative', 'soft', 'core', 'moments', 'violence', 'seen', 'more', 'day', 'day', 'characters', 'involved', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'live', 'are', 'heroes', 'here', 'just', 'anti-heroes', 'Men', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'perhaps', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Men', 'who', 'brutally', 'take', 'justice', 'own', 'hands', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'do', 'things', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'face', 'end', 'somewhat', 'happy', 'ending', 'occurs', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'end', 'deal', 'here', 'ride']",Hell Ride

Bishop stars as the leader of a motorcycle gang (also consisting of Michael Madsen and Eric Balfour) preparing to go to bloody war with a rival club (featuring Vinnie Jones).

The dialog all feels forced, with the 2-second pauses between every new sentence or exchange not helping that at all. It sounded like listening to nearly illiterate adults trying to read which makes it hard to get immersed or even interested in.  The plot felt like an afterthought, tacked on wherever there was a convenient place to stop and show bland flashbacks and tripping scenes.

What a ride.A gritty story filled with violence, orgies, lots of naked women, choppers, tons of action, bar fights, and did I mention lots of nudity? Anyway - I went into this with no expectations so I wasn't let down. The writing was horrible - but after watching the BD docus I realized that was the point. They wanted to make an old fashioned story about how bike films used to be, but with more naked ladies. So I wasn't complaining. Madsen found his calling I think, and Balfour was very believable - he has improved greatly from his soft porn days (and bulked up big time). Hopper and Carradine had walk on roles, and Vinnie was his normal self, but the ladies do steal this show.The quality of the film for BD looked ok, but the built-in grit of the film coupled with the yellow chroma on most of the lenses makes for a different viewing than I am used to with Blu. The sound was great and my subwoofer got plenty of work with all of those choppers running around. The extras were excellent as Bishop and Tarentino had no holdbacks on the interviews and docus (cuss all you want, say what is on your mind, have the ladies talk about sex all they want, etc.).I understand why so many people have their proverbial boob in a ringer over this film, but I figure the only ones reading this review or watching this film already know they are going to have fun with this...enjoy!",4,"The BD case says it best...bikers, babes and booze",1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,1545,"['Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'catch', 'up', 'kinds', 'films', 'one', 'sold', 'rented', 'better', 'big', 'titles', 'week', 'so', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'What', 'ride.A', 'gritty', 'story', 'filled', 'violence', 'orgies', 'lots', 'naked', 'women', 'choppers', 'tons', 'action', 'bar', 'fights', 'did', 'mention', 'lots', 'nudity', 'Anyway', 'went', 'expectations', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'writing', 'was', 'horrible', 'watching', 'BD', 'docus', 'realized', 'was', 'point', 'wanted', 'make', 'old', 'fashioned', 'story', 'how', 'bike', 'films', 'used', 'be', 'more', 'naked', 'ladies', 'was', ""n't"", 'complaining', 'Madsen', 'found', 'calling', 'think', 'Balfour', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'improved', 'greatly', 'soft', 'porn', 'days', 'bulked', 'up', 'big', 'time', 'Hopper', 'Carradine', 'had', 'walk', 'roles', 'Vinnie', 'was', 'normal', 'self', 'ladies', 'do', 'steal', 'show.The', 'quality', 'film', 'BD', 'looked', 'ok', 'built-in', 'grit', 'film', 'coupled', 'yellow', 'chroma', 'most', 'lenses', 'different', 'viewing', 'am', 'used', 'Blu', 'sound', 'was', 'great', 'subwoofer', 'got', 'plenty', 'work', 'choppers', 'running', 'around', 'extras', 'were', 'excellent', 'Bishop', 'Tarentino', 'had', 'holdbacks', 'interviews', 'docus', 'cuss', 'want', 'say', 'what', 'mind', 'have', 'ladies', 'talk', 'sex', 'want', 'etc', '.I', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'proverbial', 'boob', 'ringer', 'film', 'figure', 'only', 'ones', 'reading', 'review', 'watching', 'film', 'already', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'fun', 'enjoy']",Hell Ride
1175944,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001CDFY50,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[11, 24]","Quentin Tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry you had to make your own Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. Writer/actor/director Larry Bishop seems to have taken that advice a little too literally with Hell Ride and concocted a messy homage that borrows much too heavily in its visuals, music, camerawork, and time-altering storytelling. But to properly mimic a Tarantino film, one has to have a knack for constructing creative conversations; unfortunately Hell Ride's primary derailing element is its atrocious ramblings and vulgar monologues that only work to disgust and confuse the audience while simultaneously invoking pity for the actors just for being involved.The anti-hero protagonist biker gang, The Victors, consists of several weathered vigilantes who bring their own brand of bloodthirsty justice to the lawless roads. The leader, Pistolero (Larry Bishop), is hell-bent on revenge and putting out fires. The Gent (Michael Madsen) just tries to balance his chaotic, psychotic symphony of life with putting lead into anyone who crosses his boss, and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows with a fierce loyalty and a mysterious past.On the villainous front, Deuce (David Carradine) is the mastermind who orchestrates from afar, though not quite far enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits venom and lewd explanations for his tattoos while toting a harpoon gun and a general disdain for life. While these characters might sound interesting on paper, once they're forced to rant horrendously ill-conceived dialogue all traces of cool disappear faster than the funding should for Bishop's next film.While Hell Ride is riddled with imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facet of its undoing lies in the poorly devised conversations. And because Bishop's main influences are the talky films of Tarantino, there are a lot of them. The first twenty minutes of the movie are nearly unintelligible and would probably make as much sense muted. By the time Pistolero's main squeeze is introduced and certain phrases are overused to the point of nausea, you'll pray for both death and the ability to turn the sound off. Even Dennis Hopper has trouble remaining cool while spouting off such goofy dialogue.Have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so many times that it just doesn't sound right or even make sense anymore? Bishop starts there and then keeps the madness going until you envy the characters onscreen getting their heads cut off. And when the dialogue finally takes a break, we're treated to interspersed shots of nude female oil wrestling and throats being slashed. I'm not sure what effect Bishop hoped to attain, but I doubt he found it.Hell Ride wants to pay homage to Quentin Tarantino films, Robert Rodriguez films, and every movie that idolizes the violent and devil-may-care attitudes of bikers. But while its intentions may be noble, the horrendously cringe-worthy dialogue and the hyper-stylized timeline-mangling editing prevents the audience from becoming invested with the generic tough-guy characters. By the time we figure out the mystery behind the characters' motives (and it may be awhile before you even realize there's a mystery to be solved), it's just too hard to care anymore. And while everyone onscreen is clearly having fun, they've entirely neglected to translate any of that entertainment to the audience.- Joel Massie",1,Hell Ride Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,3393,"['Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'once', 'said', 'succeed', 'film', 'industry', 'had', 'make', 'own', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Writer/actor/director', 'Larry', 'Bishop', 'have', 'taken', 'little', 'too', 'literally', 'Hell', 'Ride', 'concocted', 'messy', 'homage', 'much', 'too', 'heavily', 'visuals', 'music', 'camerawork', 'time-altering', 'storytelling', 'properly', 'mimic', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'knack', 'constructing', 'creative', 'conversations', 'unfortunately', 'Hell', 'Ride', 'primary', 'derailing', 'element', 'atrocious', 'ramblings', 'vulgar', 'monologues', 'only', 'work', 'disgust', 'confuse', 'audience', 'simultaneously', 'invoking', 'pity', 'actors', 'just', 'being', 'involved.The', 'anti-hero', 'protagonist', 'biker', 'gang', 'Victors', 'consists', 'several', 'weathered', 'vigilantes', 'who', 'bring', 'own', 'brand', 'bloodthirsty', 'justice', 'lawless', 'roads', 'leader', 'Pistolero', 'Larry', 'Bishop', 'hell-bent', 'revenge', 'putting', 'out', 'fires', 'Gent', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'just', 'tries', 'balance', 'chaotic', 'psychotic', 'symphony', 'life', 'putting', 'lead', 'anyone', 'who', 'boss', 'Comanche', 'Eric', 'Balfour', 'fierce', 'loyalty', 'mysterious', 'past.On', 'villainous', 'front', 'Deuce', 'David', 'Carradine', 'mastermind', 'who', 'afar', 'not', 'quite', 'far', 'enough', 'Billy', 'Wings', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'venom', 'lewd', 'explanations', 'tattoos', 'toting', 'harpoon', 'gun', 'general', 'disdain', 'life', 'characters', 'might', 'sound', 'interesting', 'paper', 'once', ""'re"", 'forced', 'rant', 'horrendously', 'ill-conceived', 'dialogue', 'traces', 'cool', 'disappear', 'faster', 'funding', 'should', 'Bishop', 'next', 'film.While', 'Hell', 'Ride', 'riddled', 'imperfections', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'main', 'facet', 'undoing', 'lies', 'poorly', 'devised', 'conversations', 'Bishop', 'main', 'influences', 'are', 'talky', 'films', 'Tarantino', 'are', 'lot', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'nearly', 'unintelligible', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'muted', 'time', 'Pistolero', 'main', 'squeeze', 'introduced', 'certain', 'phrases', 'are', 'overused', 'point', 'nausea', ""'ll"", 'pray', 'death', 'ability', 'turn', 'sound', 'Even', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'trouble', 'remaining', 'cool', 'spouting', 'off', 'such', 'goofy', 'dialogue.Have', 'ever', 'repeated', 'word', 'phrase', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'just', ""n't"", 'sound', 'right', 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'anymore', 'Bishop', 'there', 'then', 'madness', 'going', 'envy', 'characters', 'onscreen', 'getting', 'heads', 'cut', 'off', 'when', 'dialogue', 'finally', 'break', ""'re"", 'treated', 'interspersed', 'shots', 'nude', 'female', 'oil', 'wrestling', 'throats', 'being', 'slashed', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'effect', 'Bishop', 'hoped', 'attain', 'doubt', 'found', 'it.Hell', 'Ride', 'pay', 'homage', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'films', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'films', 'movie', 'violent', 'devil-may-care', 'attitudes', 'bikers', 'intentions', 'may', 'be', 'noble', 'horrendously', 'cringe-worthy', 'dialogue', 'hyper-stylized', 'timeline-mangling', 'editing', 'audience', 'becoming', 'invested', 'generic', 'tough-guy', 'characters', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'characters', 'motives', 'may', 'be', 'awhile', 'even', 'realize', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'care', 'anymore', 'everyone', 'onscreen', 'clearly', 'having', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'entirely', 'neglected', 'translate', 'entertainment', 'audience.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",Hell Ride
1175945,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001CDFY50,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","The story of ""Hell Ride,"" homage to the biker movies of the late 60s, revolves around three bikers: Pistolero (Larry Bishop), The Gent (Michael Madsen) and Comanche (Eric Balfour). Well, you may not be interested in the biker flick genre or the film's cast, but the film has supports (or cameos) from David Carradine, Dennis Hopper, and Vinnie Jones, and you think the film could be entertaining, or at least OK, with interesting characters and clever dialogues.Actually, ""Hell Ride"" is a huge disappointment, not because of its nudity or violence (which I don't hate themselves), but because of their pointlessness. Larry Bishop's Pistolero is, the film shows, bent on revenge for the death of his girlfriend. The film's story also involves the rivalry between two biker gangs, the Victors and the 666s. However, Larry Bishop just doesn't look like the vengeful tough-guy he plays, and I can't see any difference between these two gangs. Also, Bishop as star and director spends so much time on delivering ludicrous lines, which are too self-conscious, and when he has nothing to do, all he can do is show nudity and violence, which soon become very boring.""Hell Ride"" is written and directed by Larry Bishop. Back in the late 60s he was seen in some of the AIP exploitation films such as ""The Savage Seven,"" but some people might remember him as the son of Joey Bishop, member of ""The Rat Pack."" For ""Mad Dog House,"" his previous effort as a director made in 1996, Larry Bishop managed to collect something of an interesting cast - Henry Silva and Christopher Jones among them - and he wasted the great opportunity, as he does in ""Hell Ride.""""Hell Ride"" still has one good thing and that is its soundtrack.

The only problem that I had with the movie was the dialogue. Everything and everybody sounded like Larry Bishop trying to do his super cool talk. That would have been ok if it was just Pistolero doing it but when every character talks like that it gets to be almost ridiculous and annoying. I just once wanted to hear one of the characters in the movie listen to this goofy jibber jabber and say, ""What the heck are you morons saying?""The chicks in the movie were really hot but again just like I said above the dialogue was all Bishop. Nadas first scene was sexy but the stuff she said in it and in her other scenes was just too forced, too goofy and too contrived.I liked the cast pretty much from top to bottom though I wasn't sold on Eric Balfour at all at first. I think in the end he ended up doing an ok job. David Carradine and Dennis Hopper were welcome suprises and like all the others they did an ok job with the terrible dialogue they were given. Michael Madsen and Balfours fight in the Dani's bar was just completely nonsensical and stupid. Also Bishop looked like he was trying to hit the right pose in every shot and for the most part it was the same pose ever time.The bikes were really cool and I also enjoyed all the extras on the DVD about the making of the movie and about the guys, girls and bikes used in the movie. This movie was pretty much total exploitation trash which is what it was going for but it could have been so much better if it would have had somebody else write the dialogue. The story was actually pretty good.
