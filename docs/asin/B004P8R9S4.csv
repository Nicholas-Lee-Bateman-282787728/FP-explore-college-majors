I kept hoping this past year or so that they would come out with the Jabberjaw series on DVD.  Well they did! =)  To me, it's kind of like Josie and the Pussycats.  You have a group of teens with a pet shark and together they are a band that plays music and thwarts the bad guys.  I like the underwater aspect of the show as well.  Pretty cool.  So pretty much think Josie and the Pussycats, but underwater with a nutty shark who sounds like Curly from the 3 Stooges.  I recommend waiting for amazon to put it on sale though because 40 bucks is too steep in my opinion for these classic releases.  They would do more business, I think, if they would only charge $20 for the classics like this.",5,Just like I remember,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,818,"['Very', 'good', 'series', 'just', 'remember', 'life', 'have', 'watched', 'Jabberjaw', 'here', 'there', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'kept', 'hoping', 'past', 'year', 'so', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'Jabberjaw', 'series', 'DVD', 'Well', 'did', '=', 'kind', 'like', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'have', 'group', 'teens', 'pet', 'shark', 'together', 'are', 'band', 'music', 'bad', 'guys', 'underwater', 'aspect', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'Pretty', 'cool', 'So', 'pretty', 'much', 'think', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'underwater', 'nutty', 'shark', 'who', 'Curly', '3', 'Stooges', 'recommend', 'waiting', 'amazon', 'put', 'sale', '40', 'bucks', 'too', 'steep', 'opinion', 'classic', 'releases', 'would', 'do', 'more', 'business', 'think', 'would', 'only', 'charge', '20', 'classics']",N/A
1423451,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B004P8R9S4,Graves,"[3, 3]","Jabber Jaw is one of those 70&#8217;s cartoons that people either hate or love, there really wasn&#8217;t a middle ground. Built on the well establish HB lines of &#8220;meddling kids with weird side kick solve crimes&#8221; it came when the originality was sort of wearing very thin and so a lot of the load fell onto the lead character, a great white shark and this is where, for me it fell down.Jabber Jaw is set in the future and underwater but the lead character is a shark who has no problem &#8216;swimming&#8217; in the air next to his human buddies and seems to have an elastic shape. Add on to that the fact that a character portraying the most devastating apex predator in the oceans has only marginally more back bone than Scooby Doo and I remember even as a kid being unable to suspend disbelief.  Yeah, yeah I know, I know I was not bugged by the talking animal or the fact he&#8217;s buddy&#8217;s with what most of his kin would have considered a buffet  but even as a kid I was annoyed by the three stooges personality and floating in air shark.Maybe I was just too old when it came on. I still loved Scooby doo and had a fond place for Speed buggy, Chan and the Chan Clan, Funky Phantom, and Josie and the Pussycats, but Jabber Jaw?.  Just not my style. I tried revisiitng it as an adult with a better view of these things and an appreciation for the better quality of kids programing in the 70's but still hit the same problems.Still if you had fond memories of it, then buy it and watch it again. I&#8217;ve found that those cartoons you loved as a child still reach something deep down and are well worth revisiting.",3,"A matter of taste, like sushi.",1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,1637,"['Jabber', 'Jaw', 'one', '70', '8217', 'cartoons', 'people', 'hate', 'love', 'really', 'wasn', '8217', 'middle', 'ground', 'Built', 'well', 'establish', 'HB', 'lines', '8220', 'meddling', 'kids', 'weird', 'side', 'kick', 'solve', 'crimes', '8221', 'came', 'when', 'originality', 'was', 'sort', 'wearing', 'very', 'thin', 'so', 'lot', 'load', 'fell', 'lead', 'character', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'where', 'fell', 'down.Jabber', 'Jaw', 'set', 'future', 'underwater', 'lead', 'character', 'shark', 'who', 'problem', '8216', 'swimming', '8217', 'air', 'human', 'buddies', 'have', 'elastic', 'shape', 'Add', 'fact', 'character', 'portraying', 'most', 'devastating', 'apex', 'predator', 'oceans', 'only', 'marginally', 'more', 'back', 'bone', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'remember', 'even', 'kid', 'being', 'unable', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'Yeah', 'yeah', 'know', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'bugged', 'talking', 'animal', 'fact', '8217', 'buddy', '8217', 's', 'what', 'most', 'kin', 'would', 'have', 'considered', 'buffet', 'even', 'kid', 'was', 'annoyed', 'three', 'stooges', 'personality', 'floating', 'air', 'shark.Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'old', 'when', 'came', 'still', 'loved', 'Scooby', 'doo', 'had', 'fond', 'place', 'Speed', 'buggy', 'Chan', 'Chan', 'Clan', 'Funky', 'Phantom', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'Jabber', 'Jaw', 'Just', 'not', 'style', 'tried', 'revisiitng', 'adult', 'better', 'view', 'things', 'appreciation', 'better', 'quality', 'kids', 'programing', '70', 'still', 'hit', 'same', 'problems.Still', 'had', 'fond', 'memories', 'then', 'buy', 'watch', 'again', '8217', 'found', 'cartoons', 'loved', 'child', 'still', 'reach', 'something', 'deep', 'down', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'revisiting']",N/A
1423452,AQKY5TW7OTY9W,B004P8R9S4,"Marvin The Critic ""&#34;The Critic&#34;""","[8, 9]","Warning!!! (in depth review ahead)So  after waiting  just about a year to order to  this  dvd I finally got it . It came via overnight mail. This was the first time I had chosen the one day shipping and Amazon did a great job as always. I ordered it Friday morning and got it Saturday morning. I was very happy with the shipping process.Now I know right off the bat many  people seem to have mixed feelings about this show. It came out after Scoooby Doo and loosely followed the format.The exception was there were no ghost or monsters just straight villians in this one.The show consist of 5 main characters. Biff on lead guitar(the leader and  underwater counterpart to Allen of josie and the pussycats), Shelly on tamborine (who is similar to Alexandria from Josie and the Pussycats minus the White Streak and Sebastion),Bubbles on  piano (who is ditzy and sounds exactly like  gracie allen),Clamhead on second guitar (who is essentially a Shaggy/Jughead reincarnation) and Jabberjaw, the main character on drums.This band goes from location to location playing random gigs (similair to the plot of josie and the pussycats).There are 16 episodes in all, and they all generally follow the same  pattern. Which is the villain does something underhanded and then Jabber and the gang get mixed up in it by mistake at some point.  Then the gang comes up with a plan that involves Jabberjaw being in the middle of it.One unique thing about Jabbejaw is  he is extremely pliable. He can just about turn into any shape. He can be as flat as a rug or as round as a balloon. This comes in handy when he runs into all types of chase situations.Another thing that makes this show interesting is the music during the chase scenes.  It is the band's  own music played in the background. After few episodes a listener starts to get real familiar with the songs.There are only about 4 sounds in the  band's collection, and they get played to the max throughout the run of the show.The  weird thing is there are several partial songs played when the band is actually performing on stage, but they are never heard in full.Which leads me to believe that these partial songs were just incidental music to make it appear the band had many songs, but in reality they only had 3 or 4 that were full compositions.The following songs are played for many of the chase scenes and they are pretty catchy:There's a Mountain of Time (favorite of mine)Cruisin' 2062 (another of my favorite)I Aint' Got No MoneyYou Gotta Believe in LoveThey are unlike Josie and the Pusscycats where at least 8 or so songs are cycled for chase scenes over a span of a couple of  epsidoes.Unlike Josie and the Pussycats the songs are often cut short. So a song that generally ran a minute and half might only run 45 seconds all of sudden and then come to an abrupt end oddly. This can take away from the enjoyement of the show  being that the songs are really  one of the biggest reasons to even watch the show.I found myself wanting to hear more of the band's full songs, but unfortunately that request is seldomly fulfilled.Now one of the biggest annoyances for the show is the main character himself. He is often acting just like Curly from the Three Stooges and that can be a bit much sometimes. His often repeated line is ""no respect"" which can also get a bit jarring at times.  The nyuk, nyuk, nyuk can be a bit annoying too. These are my  only real gripes about the character and could be a reason why the series didn't go beyond the 16 episode standard.This show is perfect for when you don't want to watch anything very serious or doesn't involve becoming  super involved with characters or plotlines.This is also perfect for watching late nights when there is nothing on tv and you want to just eat junk food and be a kid again.This is not on the  level of Scooby doo when it comes to characters or plots. It is much closer in set up to Josie and the Pussycats. So if you like the idea of young adults running around without any kind of supervision, and a pet shark going along for the ride then get this.I will admit several of the episodes can drag a bit in the middle, but before you know it the show is over.It is worth having if you either grew up with Hanna-Barbera cartoons, remember watching these episodes on tv during the cartoon network age or when they originally showed on television. I think it is worth the purchase for the nostalgia  alone. Keep in mind this may not be for everybody if you don't fall under one of the previously mentioned catergories.This show is good for what it is...mindless entertainment:-]",4,They're Cruisin'  2062,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,4590,"['Warning', 'depth', 'review', 'ahead', 'So', 'waiting', 'just', 'year', 'order', 'dvd', 'finally', 'got', 'came', 'overnight', 'mail', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'chosen', 'one', 'day', 'shipping', 'Amazon', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'always', 'ordered', 'Friday', 'morning', 'got', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'shipping', 'process.Now', 'know', 'right', 'bat', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'show', 'came', 'out', 'Scoooby', 'Doo', 'loosely', 'followed', 'format.The', 'exception', 'was', 'were', 'ghost', 'monsters', 'just', 'straight', 'villians', 'one.The', 'show', 'consist', '5', 'main', 'characters', 'Biff', 'lead', 'guitar', 'leader', 'underwater', 'counterpart', 'Allen', 'josie', 'pussycats', 'Shelly', 'tamborine', 'who', 'similar', 'Alexandria', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'minus', 'White', 'Streak', 'Sebastion', 'Bubbles', 'piano', 'who', 'ditzy', 'exactly', 'gracie', 'allen', 'Clamhead', 'second', 'guitar', 'who', 'essentially', 'Shaggy/Jughead', 'reincarnation', 'Jabberjaw', 'main', 'character', 'drums.This', 'band', 'location', 'location', 'playing', 'random', 'gigs', 'similair', 'plot', 'josie', 'pussycats', 'are', '16', 'episodes', 'generally', 'follow', 'same', 'pattern', 'villain', 'something', 'underhanded', 'then', 'Jabber', 'gang', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'mistake', 'point', 'Then', 'gang', 'up', 'plan', 'Jabberjaw', 'being', 'middle', 'it.One', 'unique', 'thing', 'Jabbejaw', 'extremely', 'pliable', 'can', 'just', 'about', 'turn', 'shape', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'flat', 'rug', 'as', 'round', 'balloon', 'handy', 'when', 'types', 'chase', 'situations.Another', 'thing', 'show', 'interesting', 'music', 'chase', 'scenes', 'band', 'own', 'music', 'played', 'background', 'few', 'episodes', 'listener', 'get', 'real', 'familiar', 'songs.There', 'are', 'only', '4', 'sounds', 'band', 'collection', 'get', 'played', 'max', 'run', 'show.The', 'weird', 'thing', 'are', 'several', 'partial', 'songs', 'played', 'when', 'band', 'actually', 'performing', 'stage', 'are', 'never', 'heard', 'full.Which', 'leads', 'believe', 'partial', 'songs', 'were', 'just', 'incidental', 'music', 'make', 'appear', 'band', 'had', 'many', 'songs', 'reality', 'only', 'had', '3', '4', 'were', 'full', 'compositions.The', 'following', 'songs', 'are', 'played', 'many', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'catchy', 'Mountain', 'Time', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Cruisin', '2062', 'favorite', 'Aint', 'Got', 'No', 'MoneyYou', 'Got', 'ta', 'Believe', 'LoveThey', 'are', 'Josie', 'Pusscycats', 'where', 'least', '8', 'so', 'songs', 'are', 'cycled', 'chase', 'scenes', 'span', 'couple', 'epsidoes.Unlike', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'songs', 'are', 'often', 'cut', 'short', 'song', 'generally', 'ran', 'minute', 'half', 'might', 'only', 'run', '45', 'seconds', 'sudden', 'then', 'come', 'abrupt', 'end', 'oddly', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'enjoyement', 'show', 'being', 'songs', 'are', 'really', 'one', 'biggest', 'reasons', 'even', 'watch', 'show.I', 'found', 'wanting', 'hear', 'more', 'band', 'full', 'songs', 'unfortunately', 'request', 'seldomly', 'fulfilled.Now', 'one', 'biggest', 'annoyances', 'show', 'main', 'character', 'often', 'acting', 'just', 'Curly', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'sometimes', 'often', 'repeated', 'line', 'respect', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'bit', 'jarring', 'times', 'nyuk', 'nyuk', 'nyuk', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'annoying', 'too', 'are', 'only', 'real', 'gripes', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', '16', 'episode', 'standard.This', 'show', 'perfect', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'anything', 'very', 'serious', ""n't"", 'involve', 'becoming', 'super', 'involved', 'characters', 'plotlines.This', 'also', 'perfect', 'watching', 'late', 'nights', 'when', 'nothing', 'tv', 'want', 'just', 'eat', 'junk', 'food', 'be', 'kid', 'again.This', 'not', 'level', 'Scooby', 'doo', 'when', 'characters', 'plots', 'much', 'closer', 'set', 'up', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'So', 'like', 'idea', 'young', 'adults', 'running', 'around', 'kind', 'supervision', 'pet', 'shark', 'going', 'along', 'ride', 'then', 'get', 'this.I', 'will', 'admit', 'several', 'episodes', 'can', 'drag', 'bit', 'middle', 'know', 'show', 'over.It', 'worth', 'having', 'either', 'grew', 'up', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'cartoons', 'remember', 'watching', 'episodes', 'tv', 'cartoon', 'network', 'age', 'when', 'originally', 'showed', 'television', 'think', 'purchase', 'nostalgia', 'alone', 'Keep', 'mind', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everybody', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'one', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'catergories.This', 'show', 'good', 'what', 'mindless', 'entertainment', ']']",N/A
