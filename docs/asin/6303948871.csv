It deserves being seen on disc and discovered. Why this is so ""unkonwn,"" I don't know.Robert Duvall, who almost never gives a bad performance, is excellent in here, too, as the ever-optimistic ""Mr. Cox."" He's a self-described oil man but in truth has never done anything noteworthy in the business. However, after finding himself in a small Texas town called ""Henrietta,"" (which really exists) he thinks this one residence has a lot of oil on its property. The tough part is trying to convince the literally-poor landowner (Aiden Quinn) that he should invest $5,000 on a well.All kinds of obstacles ensue - an non-supporting wife (Frances Fisher), an antagonistic and hot-tempered villain who runs things in the area (Brian Dennehy) and just plain bad luck.Duvall and his pet cat who sticks by him like glue throughout much of the film, keeps this story together.If you like a good drama and appreciate Duvall's talents, you should like this.",4,One Of Those Unknown Good Ones,1243468800,"05 28, 2009",2009,1081,"['Well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fairly-unknown', 'film', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'perhaps', 'enough', ""'m"", 'sorry', '2009', 'still', 'not', 'out', 'DVD', 'being', 'seen', 'disc', 'discovered', 'Why', 'so', 'unkonwn', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'almost', 'never', 'bad', 'performance', 'excellent', 'here', 'too', 'ever-optimistic', 'Mr', 'Cox', 'self-described', 'oil', 'man', 'truth', 'never', 'done', 'anything', 'noteworthy', 'business', 'However', 'finding', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'called', 'Henrietta', 'really', 'one', 'residence', 'lot', 'oil', 'property', 'tough', 'part', 'trying', 'convince', 'literally-poor', 'landowner', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'should', 'invest', '5,000', 'well.All', 'kinds', 'obstacles', 'ensue', 'non-supporting', 'wife', 'Frances', 'Fisher', 'antagonistic', 'hot-tempered', 'villain', 'who', 'things', 'area', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'luck.Duvall', 'pet', 'cat', 'who', 'glue', 'much', 'film', 'story', 'together.If', 'good', 'drama', 'appreciate', 'Duvall', 'talents', 'should', 'like']",Stars Fell on Henrietta VHS

391211,AFSQ6YUV4ZGYD,6303948871,jct456,"[1, 1]","I tracked down an old VHS tape through aLibris after reading these reviews (when is the DVD coming out?), and the effort was worth it.  This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time, and I have watched it several times already.  This film shows a vintage piece of Americana, and says something about the indomitable human spirit, especially the American frontier spirit, where capitalism meets Wild West mentality.As others have said, Robert Duvall is terrific in the character role of Mr. Cox, submerging himself in the role.  But for me, the most moving role and acting were those of Aidan Quinn, as the beaten-down scorned dirt farmer, Don Day, who still has the soul of a dreamer. Day and Cox are kindred spirits, but Quinn's character never loses his integrity and gentleness - Quinn is so good at portraying strength and tenderness in the same character. He looks like someone straight out of one of those old WPA Depression photos.  The story of what happens to Cox and the Day family on their failing farm is emotionally satisfying.The settings are wonderfully specific to the time and place.  My husband, a 5th-generation farmer, related strongly to the story, and loved seeing the old tractors, pickups, and automobiles.You and your whole family will love this movie, and it would be a great film for history classes studying the Depression.
