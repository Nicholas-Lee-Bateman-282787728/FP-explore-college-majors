This album is a classic of classic songs from Rush.  All the songs rock and Rush is one of the few bands whose songs sound good live - not like some kind of twisted, stream of consciousness, we've played these songs a hundred times and we are REALLY bored crap like many other bands do.

906890,A3ANNIRMIGPFKP,B0009JQJRK,Eric,"[0, 0]","I've been a longtime fan of Rush, and I think they put on a good show at their concerts.  So, it's always good to have video of Rush's performances.  This concert video has a good set of songs, including some from their then-recent Moving Pictures album (Limelight, Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, and YYZ), as well as some songs from their previous albums (The Trees, Xanadu, Freewill, Closer To The Heart, and more).However, I am a little disappointed with a couple things:- Some songs are incomplete or totally left out: I heard that their Exit Stage Left tour was the only tour during which they played ""The Camera Eye"" live.  However, that song does not appear in this video, except briefly when they play a small part of it in the background during the intro.  I also heard that Rush played Witch Hunt during this tour, but that song does not appear in this recording.  The video is only about an hour long; A DVD can certainly store more than that, and it would be nice to have the complete concert.- There is commentary and edited visual effects intertwined with the video.  When most of the songs start up, there is a short voice-over commentary about the song that I find distracting.  Also, there are shots that include edited effects such as borders around the players, etc. that I think distracts from the concert feel.  When I watch a concert video, I prefer to see an unedited concert, as it happened, so I feel more like I'm actually there.Despite the missing songs and added-in commentary and effects, it's still better to have something rather than nothing.  It's always great to see Rush in concert!",3,It's good to at least have some footage..,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,1613,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'longtime', 'fan', 'Rush', 'think', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'concerts', 'So', 'always', 'good', 'have', 'video', 'Rush', 'performances', 'concert', 'video', 'good', 'set', 'songs', 'including', 'then-recent', 'Moving', 'Pictures', 'album', 'Limelight', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Red', 'Barchetta', 'YYZ', 'as', 'well', 'songs', 'previous', 'albums', 'Trees', 'Xanadu', 'Freewill', 'Closer', 'Heart', 'more', '.However', 'am', 'little', 'disappointed', 'couple', 'things', 'songs', 'are', 'incomplete', 'totally', 'left', 'out', 'heard', 'Exit', 'Stage', 'Left', 'tour', 'was', 'only', 'tour', 'played', 'Camera', 'Eye', 'live', 'However', 'song', 'not', 'appear', 'video', 'briefly', 'when', 'play', 'small', 'part', 'background', 'intro', 'also', 'heard', 'Rush', 'played', 'Witch', 'Hunt', 'tour', 'song', 'not', 'appear', 'recording', 'video', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'A', 'DVD', 'can', 'certainly', 'store', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'complete', 'concert.-', 'commentary', 'edited', 'visual', 'effects', 'intertwined', 'video', 'When', 'most', 'songs', 'start', 'up', 'short', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'song', 'find', 'distracting', 'Also', 'are', 'shots', 'include', 'edited', 'effects', 'such', 'borders', 'players', 'etc', 'think', 'distracts', 'concert', 'feel', 'When', 'watch', 'concert', 'video', 'prefer', 'see', 'unedited', 'concert', 'happened', 'feel', 'more', ""'m"", 'actually', 'there.Despite', 'missing', 'songs', 'added-in', 'commentary', 'effects', 'still', 'better', 'have', 'something', 'rather', 'nothing', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'Rush', 'concert']",Rush: Exit...Stage Left
906891,A1D9D8BJ4RLWWU,B0009JQJRK,G. Parnell,"[21, 29]","I never saw the VHS version of this concert.  I wore out a dozen ""Exit Stage Left"" cassettes and my CD still gets a lot of play.  Suffice it to say, ""I love the music from this tour.""  The video footage was well captured and well done all the way around.  No complaints there.  But every song is interrupted with commentary and goofy visual effects that have nothing to do with the concert.  For instance:Geddy Lee on stage, ""This a song about a car, this is called Red Barchetta."" Then the audio and video are interrupted for some oration and a stupid, low quality visual.  Fellas, that is tripe.  Tripe.  I want to see the concert, please.  I want to listen to the music, please.  Spare me the gimmicks.  You are Rush.  You do not need this kind of garbage.  It detracts from the overall effect, which is to imagine yourself at the concert!  When the DVD was made, the corny crap should have been canned.  Most of the songs are corrupted in this manner.  Thank God nobody pulled these pranks on the music album!  Thank God.  I am so sick of concert DVD's that fall into this same category.  The only thing worse is the cursed ""change the camera angle every second"" effect.Isn't anyone else interested in plain old concert footage?  Am I the only one?  I've been to hundreds of concerts.  Can you imagine it?  Geddy Lee in front of thousands of screaming fans, just beginning a song, then the lights and sound fade out, a voice comes over the P.A telling us what the song is about while some cheesy video footage is displayed.  There would be a riot.  People would trash the place.  Why do DVD's of concerts have to be different?

Since then, I've also bought this on Laserdisc and while that did look better than the VHS, it still basically looked like crap.  Well, not anymore.  The remastered video here looks incredible and the sound, especially the DTS track, is astounding.  Alex Lifeson actually had a hand in the 5.1 mix and if you have your rear levels set just right, the DTS sound will blow you away.  And after all these years, the performance is still incredible.  I have to say that if anything, this video has only improved with age.  All three members of the band are absolutely at the top of their game here.  And because of the new 5.1 soundtrack, you can now actually hear what the hell the guys are saying on the voiceovers.  If you like this band, this is the only video you need.
