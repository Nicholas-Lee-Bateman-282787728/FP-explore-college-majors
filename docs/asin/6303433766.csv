374356,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,6303433766,AC,"[3, 3]","When I ran across a VHS tape of this, in a thrift store, I had never heard of the movie, or of the true story that it was based on.I only knew, given the date of the release (per the VHS tape sleeve), that it would represent one of the first feature films in which Kate Winslet appeared (it turns out that it was *the* first) ... and I recognized the actress who played the other lead role (as in, I strongly suspected that it was an actress I'd seen in productions since, but had never seen her at so young an age, and had no idea that she'd been acting this long), but I hadn't previously known her name (something that can be said of many terrific character actors), and suspected that it might be one of the first feature films in which she appeared (as with Kate Winslet, it turns out to have been Melanie Lynskey's feature film debut).I was also intrigued by the fact that Peter Jackson directed, co-produced, and co-wrote the screenplay for the film -- and given the honors bestowed upon him over the past decade, I was curious to see an example of his work from early in his career.Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson's long-time writing (and life) partner, had originally heard of the events (upon which the film is based) when she was 10, and news of the associated crime and trial were reported extensively in newspapers (in New Zealand, where the events occurred), and had shocked the country.Fran remained interested in the case... and after she recommended to Peter that they write a screenplay based on the events, it was ultimately decided that they would focus on the girls' friendship, rather than the murder and trial -- and there are several reasons why it made/makes sense for them to have done so.Interestingly, Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson engaged in a nationwide search for people who had had close association with Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme (the girls whose actions form the basis of the film) back when the friendship, and the events in question, took place -- 40 years before.According to online sources, this involved tracking down the girls' former classmates and teachers, 17 of whom were interviewed... and speaking with family friends, colleagues, neighbors, psychologists, police, and lawyers.Importantly, the background research for the film also included Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson reading Pauline's diary, which contained daily entries of detailed description of the friendship, and events associated with such.All of the voiceover narration in the film is of excerpts from Pauline's diary (this is conveyed to the viewer via a brief statement, at the beginning of the film).Fran Walsh searched 'high and low', in a widespread search of schools from throughout New Zealand, for someone who looked a lot like Pauline, and could act. The difficulty in finding such an actress ultimately culminated in the discovery of Melanie Lynskey.The first casting calls took place in 1992. Kate Winslet won the role of Juliet, over 175 others who had auditioned.The incredible performances of the co-lead actresses in this film is rendered all the more astonishing when one considers their respective ages at the time of filming (Winslet was born in October 1975, and Lynskey in May 1977).Peter Jackson's creative direction for this film is quite amazing, and the visual effects used (and back in the early 1990s, no less), to bring the rich fantasy life of the girls 'to life', are not only highly creative, but visually captivating, and the montage 'sequences' in question (and especially when they 'overlap' a reality-based scene) are innovative and 'arresting'.As with various other fascinating 'older' movies that I happen to ultimately 'stumble upon', I am then curious (after viewing such a film) about what others had to say about the film, and especially from back when it was released.It turns out (and what an odd little coincidence this is) that I happen to have watched this film (yesterday) on the 19th anniversary of the date associated with Roger Ebert's review of the film.And while my few movie reviews don't tend to focus on a 'retelling' of a film's plot (given that so many other reviews tend to already have done so), and do, instead, focus more on things I find to be exceptional or noteworthy, or convey reflections I found myself 'chewing on' after viewing a film, etc., I did find a few of Roger Ebert's comments to be rather interesting, and find that I am in agreement with him, when it comes to his 'take' on the film -- and thought I'd include a few excerpts, for those who might not have viewed other (and plot-centered) reviews of this film --------------------The movie shows the crime as resulting from a tragic confluence of coincidences: Two girls, both emotionally unstable in just the right way to complement each other's weaknesses, are outsiders in a Christchurch girls' school. [...]------------------------------------The girls are separated when one contracts tuberculosis.They begin to write each other long, detailed letters about the events in an imaginary country they have created, with dream castles and heroic figures with which they identify. Jackson uses fantasy sequences to make this world as real for us as it is to the girls, who inhabit it as an alternative to the daily lives they find dreary.------------------------------------Casting is a delicate matter in telling a story like this, and in Melanie Lynskey as Pauline and Kate Winslet as Juliet, Jackson has found the right two actresses. There is a way Lynskey has of looking up from beneath glowering eyebrows that lets you know her insides are churning. And Juliet, superficially so ""bright"" and normal, laughs too much, agrees too quickly, always exists just this side of hysteria.------------------------------------The insight of ""Heavenly Creatures"" is that sometimes people are capable of committing acts together that they could not commit by themselves. A mob can be as small as two persons. [...] In the case of Pauline and Juliet, that truth is complicated by their own emotional maladjustments. What makes Jackson's film enthralling and frightening is the way it shows these two unhappy girls, creating an alternative world so safe and attractive they thought it was worth killing for.------------------Lastly, on a final note...This film was released in 1994, and to well-deserved critical acclaim, and high praise in reviews from around the world. Laudatory attention was focused on the acting of the co-lead actresses, and for Jackson's directing, as well as for the screenplay, which was co-written by Walsh and Jackson, and was nominated for an Academy Award (that year's award for Best Original Screenplay ended up going to Quentin Tarantino, for ""Pulp Fiction"").Of the various terms used by others to describe this film, and its acting, direction, cinematography, and script...the following descriptors are among those I find to reflect my perception and 'conclusions', as well --Exemplary, imaginative, disturbing, stunning, haunting, incisive, shocking, complex, thoughtful, astonishing, unforgettable, superb, dark, masterpiece...This is a riveting story, told in a magnificently rendered fashion, and is considered by some to be the best true crime film they've ever seen.I remain 'taken aback' by just how incredible this film is, and will now be sure to obtain a DVD version of such -- especially given that the DVD releases in Region 1 format include an 'uncut' version of the film, which is 109 minutes, versus the 99 minutes found in the original runtime version (and which is associated with the VHS, laserdisc, and DVD Regions 2 & 4 releases, as well as the version streamed on Netflix and HuluPlus).This film is an early peek at the genius of Peter Jackson's remarkable directorial talent and vision, and the great collaborative writing from the earlier years of the now-20-plus-years-along team of Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson.That being said, Melanie Lynskey is reported to have said that Jackson and Walsh acted as co-directors.""Heavenly Creatures"" is a riveting film, and its masterful production highlights an originality in filmmaking that is a wonder to behold.",5,"A riveting film, with remarkable acting

374358,AJYILFULOQ3CX,6303433766,a man from the east coast,"[1, 3]","First, know this:  ""Heavenly Creatures"" is about a murder that shocked New Zealand in the 1950's.  If a film based upon such subject matter is not your cup of tea, I suggest you stop reading right now.Ok, still with me?Then let me list the reasons why one might want to see this film:1)  You are a big Peter Jackson fan, and you'd like to learn more about the films he made before the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy; you'd also like to see why his films made him an excellent choice to helm the ""LOTR"".2)  You are a big Kate Winslet fan, and you'd like to see her in her cinematic debut (her performance here clearly establishes her as a major dramatic talent).3)  You like very off-beat films about deranged personalities.4)  You're a film buff, and you're always interested in high-quality films, and based on the reviews here on Amazon, you would like to check this one out.If your reason for viewing this film isn't articulated above, then don't bother with this one.  This isn't your average Friday night DVD entertainment.Still interested?  Read on.I won't explain the plot in this review; if you need a basic overview of the plot, check out some of the other reviews, or read it on wikipedia.What I will tell you, first and foremost, is that watching this film, you can see how Peter Jackson certainly made a very logical choice to helm the ""LOTR"" trilogy.  Why?  His ability to bring us into the minds, the thoughts, and the feelings of deranged, outcast personalities is almost parless.  Only someone who had clearly demonstrated such abilities could be trusted to bring a major character like Gollum to the big screen, and Jackson's intimate protrayal of these two girls, and their murderous machinations towards one of their mothers, is nothing short of amazing.Why is it amazing?  Because we're taken into these girls' psyches, and there we're shown how both self-centered and obsessed with one another they are.  They do not seem to have any real connection or bond with anyone outside of themselves and their profoundly twisted and dysfunctional relationship.  Yet this film does not demand any particular judgment from us; rather, one gets the impression that this film seeks merely to present us this terrible tragedy, and let us draw from it whatever lessons we can.Jackson does the same thing in ""LOTR""; we journey into Gollum's split personality, and we find that issues of self-centeredness, obsession, and irrationality abound; yet again, we're not there to judge Gollum (especially since Gandalf doesn't seem to judge him so much as pity him).The upshot?  Watching ""Heaven Creatures"" gives one insight into why Jackson was clearly an excellent choice for ""LOTR""; he can portray obsessed and irrational characters whose interaction with the world outside of themselves veers from the seemingly rational to the clearly irrational.  ""Heavenly Creatures"" is indisputable evidence of this.However ...While it might have been possible to pity Gollum rather than hate him, it's difficult to be at all sympathetic to Juliet and Gina.(beware, plot-spoilers follow)One reviewer here posted that ""almost in spite of ourselves, (we) are completely in sympathy with their decision (although afterwards, we shake ourselves back into rationality, and wonder why they came to such a desperate conclusion), we accept the racing towards inevitability that they seemed to have felt.""I certainly respect differing perceptions and points of view, but I don't agree that it is inevitable that one will sympathize with the girls' desperation, so much so that a plot to kill Gina's mother begins to seem rational, even if only for a short time.  Rather, what is so successfully protrayed here is the extremely intense and profoundly emotional symbiotic relationship these two teenage girls shared with one another.  The film's exploration of this relationship serves to explain to the viewer the context in which this murder was planned and carried out, illustrating to the viewer the girls' motive.  But I must disagree  that one is inevitably drawn into the girls' emotional world; I, for one, was not.And why was I not drawn in?  Gina's mother was not evil, not abusive, and very much did not deserve the terrible crime committed against her.  Not that anyone ""deserves"" to be bludgeoned to death with a brick; I use the word ""deserve"" to illustrate that this film protrays Gina's mother truly as a victim.  While she did not understand her daughter Gina, it can hardly be argued that she somehow brought the girls' murderous plot upon herself.  Her care and concern for Gina was evident throughout the film, even if it was equally evident that she had no idea how to reach her daughter.This film is very much a tragedy, and as much as the context of this murder is protrayed as a repressive society that doesn't give these young ladies a chance to discover their own, unique identities, neither does this film attempt to excuse or justify the murder these girls commit.  (I, for one, was very surprised by how little time both spent in prison).So, to sum up, yes, this is a high-quality film; it's well-acted, directed and photographed.  Quality is not the issue; your motive to see it is what comes into play.  As aforementioned, if you are looking into either Peter Jackson's or Kate Winslet's background, or, you like stories about deranged personalities who, in their obsession with one another, seem to both isolate themselves from their surrounding familial and social environments, whilst casting their own twisted judgments upon the same, then, well, this film is for you!But if you're just looking for some interesting-yet-entertaining Friday night escapism, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.This is a good film, but if you're not looking for this kind of story, you won't find much to like

It's an amazing contrast--with its small scale and documentary style--to the epic extravaganza of ""The Lord of the Rings."" What makes the story powerful is that it tells the true story of Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Julie Hulme (Kate Winslet,having beginner's luck before Titanic) The girls were infamous for the matricide in Christchurch in 1954.""Heavenly Creatures"" powerfully blends the realistic with the fantastical. The two isolated girls create their own ""Fourth World""--where Mario Lanza sings,they're princesses,and there are no Christians. Their close friendship becomes closer in the erotic sense as well--they bathe together,they kiss,they ask the permission of a male ""saint"" to be intimate with each other. They come from dysfunctional families. Parker's parents aren't married-a scandal at the time- and Hulme's parents are divorcing. As their families disintegrate, Julie and Pauline become obsessed with each other. They can't bear separation. They become immersed in their fantasy world.""Heavenly Creatures"" doesn't excuse the girls for their crime. It is depicted as it was--horrific. The girls' punishment is exactly what they feared the most. Peter Jackson shows the relationship as unhealthy for being obsessive,alienated from reality&finally; murderous,not for being homoerotic.""Heavenly Creatures"" is an early masterpiece for Jackson and Winslet. Jackson powerfully creates an ""alternate world"" and its consequences.

374361,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303433766,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Peter Jackson's savagely brilliant `Heavenly Creatures' has to be his finest cinematic moment.  Sure, he astounded millions (and won Oscars) for his `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but he has never been as honest and as human as he was with his delicate handling of this startling true life story.The film opens with a sequence as shocking as its conclusion; the image of two blood soaked teenage girls floating across the screen.  This opening lays a solid foundation for the masterpiece we are about to witness.  `Heavenly Creatures' tells the story of young Pauline Parker, a social outcast who lives under the strict rule of her parents Herbert and Honorah.  She has no friends and truly no life until she meets Juliet Hulme, the beautiful and interesting new girl.  The two girls bond quickly and that bond grows deeper and stronger with time.  That bond is threatened though when their parents begin to suspect that maybe the girls are too close and attempt to separate them.  What happens as a result is as horrific as it is heartbreaking.Peter Jackson's visual styling here is marvelous; the way he interjects colors and shapes to deepen the meaning behind many events in the film and to embellish the relationship between Pauline and Juliet.  This is especially evident when studying the fantasy world the two girls create for themselves.`Heavenly Creatures' truly sinks into the minds of these two girls, sheltered from the outside world and jaded by everyone around them except one another.  As their devotion towards one another grows they retreat into their fantasy world, a world where they can be together always.  They have alternate identities (Pauline is `Gina' and Juliet is `Devora') and they gallivant around clay figures and sing Mario Lanza songs and are ultimately free from the confines of their natural born existence.This film also marks the big screen debut of both Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet.  Both girls are flawless here, utterly flawless.  Lynskey captures the desperation and loneliness that engulfs her character, a loneliness that could lead someone to kill.  Her relationship with her parents is fleshed out beautifully, and Lynskey portrays the perfect emotions at the precise time to make her character not only believable but truly sympathetic.  Kate Winslet is a revelation as Juliet.  She embodies her character with confidence and sophistication and natural charm.  It's apparent from her first role that she would become a legend, and look now, just fourteen years later, and she has five Oscar nominations to her name.  Alongside Winslet and Lynskey there is also a stunning performance given by Sarah Peirse, who plays Honorah, Pauline's mother.  Her performance is brilliant, controlled and commanding and breathtakingly honest.`Heavenly Creatures' is a wonder of a film; at times soft and delicate, charming and sweet and then savage and brutal; a film that will capture your heart and soul and tears it to pieces.  As some have mentioned, there are no villains here, only victims, and I think that Jackson's handling of the sensitive material helps translate that important point.  By filming almost entirely on location (that is exact location of events) as well as having exerts from Pauline's actual diary read throughout, Peter Jackson helps create a sense of honesty, a sense of truism that permeates this impeccable film.  `Heavenly Creatures' may be hard to watch, especially as the film draws to its shocking conclusion, but there is no denying that film this powerful is nothing short of heaven-sent.",5,An impeccable film that captures the heart and chills the soul...,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,3560,"['Peter', 'Jackson', 'savagely', 'brilliant', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'be', 'finest', 'cinematic', 'moment', 'Sure', 'astounded', 'millions', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'never', 'been', 'honest', 'as', 'human', 'was', 'delicate', 'handling', 'startling', 'true', 'life', 'story.The', 'film', 'sequence', 'as', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'image', 'two', 'blood', 'soaked', 'teenage', 'girls', 'floating', 'screen', 'opening', 'solid', 'foundation', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'witness', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'story', 'young', 'Pauline', 'Parker', 'social', 'outcast', 'who', 'strict', 'rule', 'parents', 'Herbert', 'Honorah', 'friends', 'truly', 'life', 'Juliet', 'Hulme', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'new', 'girl', 'two', 'girls', 'bond', 'quickly', 'bond', 'grows', 'deeper', 'stronger', 'time', 'bond', 'threatened', 'when', 'parents', 'begin', 'suspect', 'maybe', 'girls', 'are', 'too', 'close', 'attempt', 'separate', 'What', 'result', 'as', 'horrific', 'heartbreaking.Peter', 'Jackson', 'visual', 'styling', 'here', 'marvelous', 'way', 'colors', 'shapes', 'deepen', 'meaning', 'many', 'events', 'film', 'embellish', 'relationship', 'Pauline', 'Juliet', 'especially', 'evident', 'when', 'studying', 'fantasy', 'world', 'two', 'girls', 'create', 'themselves.', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'truly', 'sinks', 'minds', 'two', 'girls', 'sheltered', 'outside', 'world', 'jaded', 'everyone', 'one', 'devotion', 'one', 'retreat', 'fantasy', 'world', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'always', 'have', 'alternate', 'identities', 'Pauline', 'Gina', 'Juliet', 'Devora', 'gallivant', 'clay', 'figures', 'sing', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'songs', 'are', 'ultimately', 'free', 'confines', 'natural', 'born', 'existence.This', 'film', 'also', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'girls', 'are', 'flawless', 'here', 'utterly', 'flawless', 'Lynskey', 'desperation', 'loneliness', 'character', 'loneliness', 'could', 'lead', 'someone', 'kill', 'relationship', 'parents', 'fleshed', 'out', 'beautifully', 'Lynskey', 'perfect', 'emotions', 'precise', 'time', 'make', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'believable', 'truly', 'sympathetic', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'revelation', 'Juliet', 'character', 'confidence', 'sophistication', 'natural', 'charm', 'apparent', 'first', 'role', 'would', 'become', 'legend', 'look', 'now', 'just', 'fourteen', 'years', 'later', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'name', 'Alongside', 'Winslet', 'Lynskey', 'also', 'stunning', 'performance', 'given', 'Sarah', 'Peirse', 'who', 'Honorah', 'Pauline', 'mother', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'controlled', 'commanding', 'breathtakingly', 'honest.', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'wonder', 'film', 'times', 'soft', 'delicate', 'charming', 'sweet', 'then', 'savage', 'brutal', 'film', 'will', 'capture', 'heart', 'soul', 'tears', 'pieces', 'have', 'mentioned', 'are', 'villains', 'here', 'only', 'victims', 'think', 'Jackson', 'handling', 'sensitive', 'material', 'translate', 'important', 'point', 'filming', 'almost', 'entirely', 'location', 'exact', 'location', 'events', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'exerts', 'Pauline', 'actual', 'diary', 'read', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'create', 'sense', 'honesty', 'sense', 'truism', 'impeccable', 'film', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'especially', 'film', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'denying', 'film', 'powerful', 'nothing', 'short', 'heaven-sent']",Heavenly Creatures VHS

At the time, the ""hype"" was about the girls' ""homosexuality"". This completely missed the point.

Dubbed by my TV guide as an 'intense and atmospheric treat,' I decided to sit and watch it, if not only for the adorable Kate Winslet. By the end I was convinced I had just watched one of the best films I have seen in years!In 1954 two girls brutally murdered one of their mothers in what still remains, to this day, perhaps the most documented and sensational murders in New Zealand's history. &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; tells the true story of this crime drama and highlights their strange friendship. If you think before you watch this that you're just in for another stereotypical blood-splatter flick then you are very much mistaken.Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) is a typical student in a strict all-girls' school who is completely bowled over when Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) joins her school and tears up her pathetic existence into something radical and fresh. They have similar interests such as the arts, sculpture, English and the tenor Mario Lanza. Eventually both the romance and the frightfulness of it all reaches a tragic conclusion. In their all consuming friendship Juliet and Pauline create a &quot;Fourth World,&quot; better than heaven (because it has no Christians), inhabited by the clay figures they have fashioned to represents their friends and where the music of Mario Lanza, the greatest tenor on earth, is always in the air.The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense, so that they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality for them. Not even a four-month stint in hospital for Juliet can keep Pauline away. Pauline drops out of school and stops talking to her parents; Juliet learns that her mother is sleeping with one of her clients, and that her parents are divorcing. Now she's being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together...such as murder.Watching the film I felt a continual underbelly of lesbianism playing a major role. These suggestions are continually squashed, however, due to the times the movie is set in where homosexuality is an 'unnatural' subject. Kate Winslet is superb as the bright and luminous Juliet and with her posh accent, she brings a certain level of humor to the film that would have been impossible without her. Melanie Lynskey portrays Pauline superbly too, contrasting from the mature attitude of a fully grown woman to the sly grin of an evil teenage girl who knows too much. The films comedy moment can be cheesy at times, but are intentional in their positions in that they counterbalance the horrifying scenes. Many moments pre-horror build up the suspense brilliantly, then perform a sort of anticlimax. However, the peaceful and tranquil music that plays just before the brutal and obscene ending is obviously intentful.The ending is what stays with the viewer most when looking back on the film The way Jackson directed the scene to be something truly spectacular was superbly pulled off. The screams of the mother and the cuts to the alternative-world made me want to cover my eyes in fear, but I persisted and watched through the horror. The dialogue of the film is brilliant, and only Peter Jackson could come up with the idea of life-size clay models that walk and talk. Six years later he'd be making something a lot grander. Richard Taylor supplies the CGI effect and is superb in doing so making for surprisingly life-like, realistic characters - remember, this was 1994!In the end what you have here is a fantastic and timeless film that is perfect for college/University studies both in direction and content. What is most fascinating, apart from the real-life chilling theme that features prominently throughout, is the fact that Peter Jackson went on to become one of the world's most celebrated directors in history, whilst Kate Winslet went on to star in the most successful motion picture of all time! This is a film that will appeal to all generations (obviously not youngsters) of people with a thirst for crime, horror, blood, gore and fantasy.

It is a remarkable achievement, none so the less  for the controversy that has surrounded it since the identities of the two  protagonists has been recently revealed.There has been much controversy  and argument over how true the film is to what exactly happened.  While all  of this is interesting when discussing the case, I ultimately don't think  it's very important when discussing the film.

Ebeling ""ctlpareader""","[11, 11]","I will always wonder what I would have thought of HEAVENLY CREATURES had I seen it when it came out rather than now, after Columbine.  This film is based on the true story of two adolescent girls in New Zealand in the 1950s who kill the mother of one of them.  The crime was shocking and like latterday Americans, the New Zealanders must have staggered about saying, we just did not see it coming and how could two girls from nice families do this?  It is precisely that question that the filmmakers seek to answer and, in a very original way, succeed at.The film follows the girls from the point they meet in the restrictive girls' school they attend to the moment of the crime.  In between it reveals two very intelligent misfits who are drawn to each other as if by a fierce law of physics.  Such is their affinity that they invent a fantasy world and inhabit it so intensely as to be able to envision exactly what the other sees in their minds.  Their bond and fantasies affect their judgment, throwing the usual excesses of emerging pubescence off kilter.  When events in their families' lives begin to insert themselves in such a way to threaten a separation of the two friends, they decide to remove the perceived obstacle in their path to togetherness.It would have been safe to suggest the mystery of the fantasy world but this film shows it concretely.  The clay figures the girls fashion to depict their characters are seen coming to life so that the audience also sees what they see and share.  There is wit, too, in the depiction of the very normal aspects of the girls' experiences with school and families.  In the end, the power of the film comes in the realization that no one aspect of the girls' lives is any different or less sympathetic than the stuff of many coming of age stories, it's just that in this case they were sucked into a vortex so powerful that it knocked out all the emotional safety catches.  The line between angel and monster is a very thin one and that is very scary.  That one of the girls is revealed to have become a well-known, successful personage in her adulthood just adds to the perplexity.All the artistic ducks are in a row behind this production.

374373,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,6303433766,Dai-keag-ity,"[3, 3]","The true-life tale told in Peter Jackson's often deceptively meandering Heavenly Creatures is one of lurid murder, and it possesses the ability to make a viewer recoil, not only because of the identity of the victim in the particularly heinous and cold blooded crime, but because of the identity of the killers. When I was in Christchurch, New Zealand this year, I happened to mention the Parker-Hulme murder, and the reactions I received from people my own age and younger showed that even fifty-three years after they occurred, the case still holds power over the collective memory of that normally peaceful nation. When I came home I watched Heavenly Creatures for the first time since high school, and found it probably even more troubling than I did years ago.Before he was better known in the United States for making The Lord of the Rings, New Zealand native Peter Jackson shot this fantasy-heavy version of a killing he'd grown up hearing so much about. He cast Kate Winslett and Melanie Lynskey as Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker, two slightly off-center girls whose unusual detachment from reality and somewhat disordered species of lesbianism set up a disturbing background for their premeditated crime. While the concept of adolescents who kill family members is less novel to us today than it was generations back, to enter into the minds and secret lives of Pauline and Juliet still makes for a unique sort of head trip. I also found the realization that Jackson shot nearly all of Heavenly Creatures on the actual sites of the events depicted generates a peculiar frisson in me every time I settle in to watch it. Jackson shot the tea shop scene in the actual restaurant in which Mrs. Parker had her last meal moments before her slaying, and as rumor has it, was set to shoot the death segment literally atop the actual ground on which the murder took place, but felt there was something too troubling in the act, so he re-located a short space away. In my opinion it's little details like these that only add to the creepy quality of Heavenly Creatures.In a side note, Juliet Hulme went on in later life to become a best selling novelist---of murder/detective fiction, no less---and is still writing today under the pen name of Anne Perry.",5,"New Zealand's Most Shocking Murder Case, And The Teenaged Girls Who Carried It Out",1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,2255,"['true-life', 'tale', 'told', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'often', 'deceptively', 'meandering', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'one', 'lurid', 'murder', 'ability', 'make', 'viewer', 'recoil', 'not', 'only', 'identity', 'victim', 'particularly', 'heinous', 'cold', 'blooded', 'crime', 'identity', 'killers', 'When', 'was', 'Christchurch', 'New', 'Zealand', 'year', 'happened', 'mention', 'Parker-Hulme', 'murder', 'reactions', 'received', 'people', 'own', 'age', 'younger', 'showed', 'even', 'fifty-three', 'years', 'occurred', 'case', 'still', 'power', 'collective', 'memory', 'normally', 'peaceful', 'nation', 'When', 'came', 'home', 'watched', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'first', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'found', 'probably', 'even', 'more', 'troubling', 'did', 'years', 'was', 'better', 'known', 'United', 'States', 'making', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'New', 'Zealand', 'native', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'shot', 'fantasy-heavy', 'version', 'killing', ""'d"", 'grown', 'up', 'hearing', 'so', 'much', 'cast', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'Juliet', 'Hulme', 'Pauline', 'Parker', 'two', 'slightly', 'off-center', 'girls', 'unusual', 'detachment', 'reality', 'somewhat', 'disordered', 'species', 'lesbianism', 'set', 'up', 'disturbing', 'background', 'premeditated', 'crime', 'concept', 'adolescents', 'who', 'kill', 'family', 'members', 'less', 'novel', 'today', 'was', 'generations', 'back', 'enter', 'minds', 'secret', 'lives', 'Pauline', 'Juliet', 'still', 'unique', 'sort', 'head', 'trip', 'also', 'found', 'realization', 'Jackson', 'shot', 'nearly', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'actual', 'sites', 'events', 'depicted', 'peculiar', 'frisson', 'time', 'settle', 'watch', 'Jackson', 'shot', 'tea', 'shop', 'scene', 'actual', 'restaurant', 'Mrs.', 'Parker', 'had', 'last', 'meal', 'moments', 'slaying', 'rumor', 'was', 'set', 'shoot', 'death', 'segment', 'literally', 'actual', 'ground', 'murder', 'took', 'place', 'felt', 'was', 'something', 'too', 'troubling', 'act', 're-located', 'short', 'space', 'away', 'opinion', 'little', 'details', 'only', 'add', 'creepy', 'quality', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures.In', 'side', 'note', 'Juliet', 'Hulme', 'went', 'later', 'life', 'become', 'best', 'selling', 'novelist', '-of', 'murder/detective', 'fiction', 'less', '-and', 'still', 'writing', 'today', 'pen', 'name', 'Anne', 'Perry']",Heavenly Creatures VHS

Telling the shocking true story of two young girls who committed a terrible crime, this film is as accurate as it is moving.  Pauline and Juliet were just two girls in love, but when their families insisted on separating them they had no choice but to take matters into their own hands.Melanie Lynskey and of course Kate Winslet work wonders with their roles, each one so different yet so much the same.  Melanie plays Pauline Rieper, the narrator of the story.  She's a bit of an outcast, living under strict watch of her parents Honorah (Sarah Pierce) and Herbert (Simon O'Connor), but when she meets Juliet things start to change for her.  As Juliet, Kate infuses so much natural charm into her character that you can instantly understand why Pauline would be attracted to her in the first place.  They instantly bond, growing closer to each other with their fantasies and stories.  Juliet's parents are much different than Pauline's.  They are much more lenient yet they tend not to take much interest in their young daughter, even going as far as to leave her when she goes ill, not seeing her for four months.The girl's parents soon start to suspect something indecent between their daughters and try and separate them, to no avail.  When Juliet's health worsens and her parent's marriage starts to crumble they insist on sending Juliet away, out of the country without Pauline.  It's at this point that the plot is hatched to murder someone standing in their way...just who is it?  The end of this film, as shocking as the beginning, will leave you speechless.  Peter Jackson deserves honors for bringing this horrendous account to life and casting such wonderful talents to help in doing so.Being the debut for both Winslet and Lynskey it definitely shows what amazing things they are capable of (I mean since her debut in '94 Kate Winslet has gone on to receive 4 Oscar nominations and may very well receive number 5 this year!).

It's an art film, an abstract expressionists impression of what the world looks like through somebody elses eyes. Unfortunately those eyes are a pair of oddball friends who fall into a fantasy world from which they can not (nor desire) to leave.  It's not to say this is a bad film, just not for everyone, as I concede my favorites like Taxi Driver and Boogie Nights might not strike the same cord with others as it did me.

374377,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6303433766,David Baldwin,"[4, 4]","This film distinguishes itself in so many ways.  It marks the arrival of Peter Jackson as a cinematic voice to be reckoned with.  His melding of bone-chilling reality and terror and fantasy suggests his later works, ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and the underappreciated remake of King Kong.  In her film debut Kate Winslet arrives auspiciously as the sickly daughter of a disfunctional upper class family.  Not to take anything away from Jackson and Winslet, who would be the selling points here, is the work of Melanie Linskey.  Aside from the scene in the beginning that forbodes the film's shocking conclusion I thought Linskey telegraphed her performance with a Kubrickian stare as she poses for a photograph with her smiling private school classmates.  Don't be fooled.  Linskey's turn is one of great subtlety as she assays the insecurities and loneliness of Pauline Parker.  Seemingly polar opposites Parker and Winslet's Juliet Hulme serve a need in each other that would ultimately become lethal.

Jackson and Walsh made the proper decision to base their film on the friendship of the two girls, climaxing with the crime and entirely ignoring the details of their trial and conviction.  This allows us to empathize with the girls, even though we know that something awful is going to happen, and making the climactic event seem almost as tragic for the perpetrators as it was for the victim.  Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, in their screen debuts, give powerful performances.

This is teen  escapism carried to the nth degree.  Innocence and wholesome fun do NOT  prevail.  As the parents grow increasingly concerned about their daughters'  obsessive relationship, the girls begin to hate the parents...  Based on a  rather shocking (for its time) true story.Kate Winslet made her film  debut in this modest com&eacute;die noire from way down under.  It is amazing to  realize that three years later she starred in the Academy Award winning  Titanic (1997), on her way to establishing herself as one of the most  charismatic and talented stars of the past decade.  In retrospect, her  budding talent is apparent here as the spinning, laughing, crazy teen who  went off the deep end emotionally.  There is no mistaking the sharp,  confident and commanding Winslet style.  Despite the part, Kate looks as  wholesome and delicious as apple pie with cherry vanilla ice cream, yet  manages to convey the demented edge necessary to the role.Full-figured  and brooding Melanie Lynskey is intriguing and not easily forgotten as  Kate's manic/depressive friend.Director Peter Jackson is to be  commended for getting the most out of the girls, and for making their  fantasy world believable.

I did a side by side comparison of exact scenes w/ the upscaled dvd (via HDMI) and this blu-ray.1) The first and foremost noticeable eye opener are some cropping (missing information) on the sides of the picture of both versions, and vice versa.  Let me explain.  In a large majority of camera shots, either the tops and bottoms, or the sides are missing on the dvd or blu-ray, and vice versa.  In simple film school terms, it is panned and scanned (P&S;) differently.  I use the term P&S; loosely because as you know it's associated w/ old 4:3 full screen, but the point is that the picture editing, cropping, and zooming are different.  I chose several exact scenes that were not in motion, and I paused at the exact location to compare.  The P&S-ing; is regardless of the aspect ratio, 1.79:1 Blu-Ray, 2.35:1 DVD.2) The 1080i blu picture is only slightly better than the upscaled dvd picture.  Blu-ray picture still contains jitters and artifacts considering a 16 years old (1994) transfer.  Colors at times are not as accurate, so the noticeable improvement is in the definition (resolution), however only slightly.3) Blu-ray: The sound of the English 2.0 track is very low, while the French 2.0 is loud.  Volume just needs manual adjusting, which is annoying that these 2 language tracks are not standardized (or equalized).4) Blu-ray contains no extra materials.  DVD contains Trailer.  Hence, you might think I'm keeping both the blu and the dvd versions, yes, I recommend that.  In fact, I'm keeping the VHS as well!

374381,A3ORWAR4CAOPAC,6303433766,DRob,"[19, 19]","I'll have to admit that my reason for wanting to see Heavenly Creatures was prurient. Anne Perry is one of my favorite mystery writers, and I was interested to see the movie Peter Jackson made about the murder she and her best friend committed as teen-aged girls.Melanie Lynskey plays the part of Pauline Yvonne Parker, who grows up in a poor family. Her parents were never actually married, and they keep boarders in their home. Lynskey portrays Pauline as a very sullen teen-ager, and deserves much more credit for her portrayal than she has received. Very rarely do you see her exhibit true happiness in this film, and the few times she does, it is always when she is with her friend, whom she sees as the only way she has of excaping her horrible life.Kate Winslet plays the part of Juliet Hulme, the privileged daughter of wealthy parents. To Pauline, it appears as though Juliet has the perfect life, but in fact, Julliet has a checkered past. Due to constant lung problems, her parents sent her away to live in the Bahamas for five years, leaving her in constant fear of abandonment. She meets Pauline on her first day of school after she and her family move to christchurch, New Zealand, and the two of them strike up a friendship.Although the movie depicts a lesbian relationship between the two of them, Anne Perry has staunchly denied that they were anything but friends. Indeed, it is not outside the realm of possibility that Perry is telling the truth as teen-aged girls frequently develop ""crushes"" on each other and have extremely intense personal friendships without any sexual involvement.What is obvious, though is that both girls were highly imaginative, and they both fulfilled a deep need in each other. Pauline needed to feel as though she were a part of Juliet's wealthy family, and Juliet needed to have someone she could count on not to leave her. Indeed, in one scene of the movie, Juliet has experienced a recurrence of tuberculosis and her parents put her in a convalescent home before leaving to spend several months in England. Pauline and her mother are the only people to visit Juliet during that terrible time.Juliet's world comes crashing down when she learns that her parents are getting a divorce. Her father is going back to England and she is being sent to stay with an aunt in South Africa. Once again, she will be abandoned by her parents and, even worse, she will be separated from Pauline. Pauline convinces her that if they kill Pauline's mother, the two of them will be able to stay together.It is sad watching the scene of Pauline's mother preparing to go out for a day's outing with her daughter and Juliet. It must have been one of the happiest days in the woman's life-- her daughter was taking her to tea and then to a park, and then her daughter and her daughter's friend savagely murder her. It is the opening scene of the movie, and the closing scene of the movie.Peter Jackson does a stellar job of weaving the girls' fantasy world into the real life elements of the story. Although he has taken some liberties with the story, that can be excused as neither of the women involved participated in any way in the making of the film. I can't say that I really enjoyed the movie so much as I thought it was an interesting portrayal of a horrible crime. However, the movie is a superb acting vehicle for a very young Kate Winslet and for Melanie Lynskey, both of whom do a terrific job of portraying their characters. The movie also foreshadows Jackson's genius and his attention to detail that we see later in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.While I wouldn't want to watch the movie again, I am glad that I at least saw it. I've read about the crime and tried to picture the events in my head. Jackson did a terrific job of translating things that I've only read about into reality.",4,Creepy Movie,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,3830,"[""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'reason', 'wanting', 'see', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'was', 'prurient', 'Anne', 'Perry', 'one', 'favorite', 'mystery', 'writers', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'made', 'murder', 'best', 'friend', 'committed', 'teen-aged', 'girls.Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'part', 'Pauline', 'Yvonne', 'Parker', 'who', 'up', 'poor', 'family', 'parents', 'were', 'never', 'actually', 'married', 'keep', 'boarders', 'home', 'Lynskey', 'Pauline', 'very', 'sullen', 'teen-ager', 'much', 'more', 'credit', 'portrayal', 'received', 'Very', 'rarely', 'do', 'see', 'exhibit', 'true', 'happiness', 'film', 'few', 'times', 'always', 'when', 'friend', 'whom', 'only', 'way', 'excaping', 'horrible', 'life.Kate', 'Winslet', 'part', 'Juliet', 'Hulme', 'privileged', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'Pauline', 'Juliet', 'perfect', 'life', 'fact', 'Julliet', 'checkered', 'past', 'Due', 'constant', 'lung', 'problems', 'parents', 'sent', 'away', 'live', 'Bahamas', 'five', 'years', 'leaving', 'constant', 'fear', 'abandonment', 'Pauline', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'family', 'move', 'christchurch', 'New', 'Zealand', 'two', 'strike', 'up', 'movie', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'two', 'Anne', 'Perry', 'staunchly', 'denied', 'were', 'anything', 'friends', 'Indeed', 'not', 'realm', 'possibility', 'Perry', 'telling', 'truth', 'teen-aged', 'girls', 'frequently', 'develop', 'crushes', 'other', 'have', 'extremely', 'intense', 'personal', 'friendships', 'sexual', 'involvement.What', 'obvious', 'though', 'girls', 'were', 'highly', 'imaginative', 'fulfilled', 'deep', 'need', 'other', 'Pauline', 'needed', 'feel', 'were', 'part', 'Juliet', 'wealthy', 'family', 'Juliet', 'needed', 'have', 'someone', 'could', 'count', 'not', 'leave', 'Indeed', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'Juliet', 'experienced', 'recurrence', 'tuberculosis', 'parents', 'put', 'convalescent', 'home', 'leaving', 'spend', 'several', 'months', 'England', 'Pauline', 'mother', 'are', 'only', 'people', 'visit', 'Juliet', 'terrible', 'time.Juliet', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'parents', 'are', 'getting', 'divorce', 'father', 'going', 'back', 'England', 'being', 'sent', 'stay', 'aunt', 'South', 'Africa', 'Once', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'abandoned', 'parents', 'even', 'worse', 'will', 'be', 'separated', 'Pauline', 'Pauline', 'kill', 'Pauline', 'mother', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'stay', 'together.It', 'sad', 'watching', 'scene', 'Pauline', 'mother', 'preparing', 'go', 'out', 'day', 'outing', 'daughter', 'Juliet', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'happiest', 'days', 'woman', 'life', 'daughter', 'was', 'taking', 'tea', 'then', 'park', 'then', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'friend', 'savagely', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'closing', 'scene', 'movie.Peter', 'Jackson', 'stellar', 'job', 'weaving', 'girls', 'fantasy', 'world', 'real', 'life', 'elements', 'story', 'taken', 'liberties', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'excused', 'women', 'involved', 'participated', 'way', 'making', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'horrible', 'crime', 'However', 'movie', 'superb', 'acting', 'vehicle', 'very', 'young', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'whom', 'do', 'terrific', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'movie', 'also', 'Jackson', 'genius', 'attention', 'detail', 'see', 'later', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy.While', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'am', 'glad', 'least', 'saw', ""'ve"", 'read', 'crime', 'tried', 'picture', 'events', 'head', 'Jackson', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'translating', 'things', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'reality']",Heavenly Creatures VHS

374383,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6303433766,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","""How can these heavenly creatures be real?"" asks one of the characters in of ""Heavenly Creatures,"" the exquisite and horrifying docudrama of a shocking, real-life murder. Famed director Peter Jackson uses spectacular special effects and great actors to show us how these heavenly creatures became monsters.In 1952, Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) is a loner at her proper New Zealand school, until the day Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) arrives -- an intelligent, witty, daring girl who appeals to Pauline. Soon the two of them are nearly inseparable; even Juliet's four month stint in the hospital doesn't separate the girls through their letters and shared fantasies.But soon their parents becomes concerned that their close friendship is ""unhealthy."" It is, just not in the way he thinks. The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense: they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality. Now Juliet is being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together... such as murder.Peter Jackson starts the movie by emphasizing what a beautiful, peaceful country (via a cheesy 1950s documentary) New Zealand is. But beauty is not everything -- fairy tales can become nightmares. Jackson doesn't just show the audience what the two girls did, but showed why they did it. Even then, he doesn't make excuses.At first the movie seems almost whimsical, with fairy tale figures coming to life, beautiful woodlands, and hillsides transforming into blooming gardens. Nobody except Peter Jackson could have pulled off the idea of including living clay figurines or four-foot-wide butterflies. Somehow it not only works, but adds to the surreality of the story.But as the girls go deeper into infatuated madness, Jackson warps the whimsical world around them. Settings get darker and more distorted, and the line between fantasy and reality is completely wiped out. The scripting keeps that creepiness going (""Our main idea for the day was to murder Mother""), as do Richard Taylor's handling of CGI and prosthetics. (How DID they do the zoom through a sand castle?)But the movie really centers around Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, and these two carry the movie beautifully. Lynskey can switch in an instant from sullenness to smiles, naive girl to murderous woman.

Their friendship quickly becomes intense, obsessive, and as each pushes their own families farther  and farther away, they wander jointly into a world that is more fantasy  than reality.Peter Jackson's dramatic recount of the true story of  matricide in Christchurch is aggressive as well as imaginative. Jackson's  creative method of storytelling includes a combination of traditional  story, with first person narrative by Pauline, and fantastic lifesize  `claymation' like portrayals of the girls' fantasies. Pauline Parker's own  diaries were contributive in reconstructing many of these events.As  their parents begin to question the `healthiness' of the relationship, a  decision is made to separate the girls from contact. Jackson implies that a  sexual relation existed between the girls as well, and it's this  implication and the resulting separation that ultimately results in the  girl's joint decision to kill.When I first saw this film, it was also my  first exposure to Kate Winslet. Her on-screen presence is so commanding,  it's virtually impossible to take your eyes off her whenever she is on  screen.I understand that, in real life, Juliet made a career as a writer  of mystery stories subsequent to her release, but Pauline is nowhere to be  found.",4,Wonderful storytelling.,950313600,"02 12, 2000",2000,1387,"['Juliet', 'Hulme', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Pauline', 'Parker', 'Melanie', 'Lynsky', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'teenagers', '1950', 'New', 'Zealand', 'friendship', 'quickly', 'intense', 'obsessive', 'pushes', 'own', 'families', 'farther', 'farther', 'away', 'wander', 'jointly', 'world', 'more', 'fantasy', 'reality.Peter', 'Jackson', 'dramatic', 'recount', 'true', 'story', 'matricide', 'Christchurch', 'aggressive', 'as', 'well', 'imaginative', 'Jackson', 'creative', 'method', 'storytelling', 'combination', 'traditional', 'story', 'first', 'person', 'narrative', 'Pauline', 'fantastic', 'lifesize', 'claymation', 'portrayals', 'girls', 'fantasies', 'Pauline', 'Parker', 'own', 'diaries', 'were', 'contributive', 'reconstructing', 'many', 'events.As', 'parents', 'begin', 'question', 'healthiness', 'relationship', 'decision', 'made', 'separate', 'girls', 'contact', 'Jackson', 'sexual', 'relation', 'existed', 'girls', 'as', 'well', 'implication', 'resulting', 'separation', 'ultimately', 'results', 'girl', 'joint', 'decision', 'kill.When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'exposure', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'so', 'commanding', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'take', 'eyes', 'whenever', 'screen.I', 'understand', 'real', 'life', 'Juliet', 'made', 'career', 'writer', 'mystery', 'stories', 'subsequent', 'release', 'Pauline', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found']",Heavenly Creatures VHS

Kind of your typical pretty-girl-ugly-girl combination, to put it bluntly.  They pretty much create an incredibly vivid and powerful fantasy world that they inhabit together, and which will propel them towards the murder and mayhem of the last 30 minutes of the movie.I bailed out with about 25 minutes left to go because by that time it was painfully obvious what was going to happen, and if there's one thing I really cannot stand, it's a painfully predictable and obvious movie especially one involving a long downhill slide that you can see coming a thousand miles away...King Lear type stuff.  However I was already starting to get restless about 45 minutes into the movie...I stayed longer mainly to finish the very good bottle of wine I'd opened, LOL!You can sort of see Peter Jackson's talent in all the fantasy scenes which he brings to another level in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and also Kate Winslet's onscreen charisma (this was her film debut apparently) which continues to make her one of my favorite actresses.

Peter Jackson's film takes as its starting point the real-life murder committed by two teenage girls in Christchurch, New Zealand in the 1950s, but transforms it into a brilliant meditation on the role of escapism and fantasy in daily life and their sometimes devastating consequences. The film takes you into the bizarre Brontsque fantasy worlds of the two young women, Pauline Rieper and Juliet Hulme, as they come to turn to each other for support against the dreadful realities of adolescence and their parents' unhappy lives, and allows you to feel their mounting intensity of hysteria as their dreamworld spins out of control.

Years later, it remains as powerful.  The wonderful, odd vision of Peter Jackson (Director of LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) is put to use in this story of two young girls whose fantasy world runs amok.I think it would be fair to say this is the breakout film that brought Kate Winslet to the well-deserved attention of a world market, but her co-star Melanie Lynskey gives the more complex performance of the two in this, if only because her role is given more layers.  The DVD is an uncut version, and it lends a different light to her sexuality than the version in theatres, but it is all still awkwardly (perfect for this story telling) ambivalent.Jackson makes weird and wonderful use of the clay figures and fantasy land of the girls, and although I don't really think he has a full handle on what a girl's fantasy land would be made of (this one was awfully muddy - ick),  it is still a compelling, complete and disturbing vision - all fitting.  There are truly great moments which feels completely, messily, real.  Sarah Peirse's entire performance is wonderful, as the more downtrodden and distressed mother. This is really fine acting.Not long after the film was released, the actual case this was based on was re-opened, and it was found that, as part of their ""treatment,"" the girls were given a drug to sedate them, but it has since been shown to cause extreme violent outbursts.  It is too bad this information could not have been available as the film was made.  I believe Jackson could have incorporated this and made the film even richer.  But that would be icing.

Many other reviwers have given detailed descriptions of the plot so I will forego that here. After some basic research subsequent to watching the film, it seems that Peter Jackson was quite faithful to the original story.  There were certain simplifications needed to fit the story into a two hour movie but that is to be expected.  The story told in this movie is a disturbing one.  The two girls are highly disturbed and engage in increasingly bizaar behavior leading up to the murder.  If you are interested in a character study about highly erratic and disturbed individuals then this movie will surely be of great interest to you.For pure entertainment value, however, I must say that I found Heavenly Creatures to be lacking in the extreme.  The girls are loud, shrill, and incredibly irritating... at least to my sensibilities.  They are constantly singing (badly), shrieking either in laughter or tears, screaming at their parents, or wildly enthusing about their elaborate imaginary stories that they are continuously writing.  As a finale, these two bash one their mothers' head in with repeated blows from a brick in a fairly grisly scene that actually underplays the violence compared to the real life murder.  Quite simply, watching this movie forces you to endure two of the most annoying and disturbing people you could ever hope NOT to meet for a seemingly endless two hours.This movie was very difficult to rate because it is such a mixed bag.  For historical accuracy and faithfulness to the real life events, I would give it 5 stars.  Yet, I found it of no entertainment value whatsoever and could not wait for it to end and I would normally give such a film 1 star.  Accordingly, I've split the difference and give it an overall rating of 3 stars.

374410,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6303433766,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[143, 155]","For those who wondered how the director of &quot;Bad Taste&quot; and &quot;Brain Dead&quot; got to direct &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; this 1994 film from director Peter Jackson supplies the answer.  In 1954 two teenage girls brutally murdered one of the their mothers in what must be the most sensational murder in New Zealand history.  &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; tells the strange story of these two girls and their unique relationship.  If you think this is just a reality based splatter flick, then you are going to be much more than surprised and impressed by what Jackson has accomplished.Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) is a simple and rather dull young girl who is totally dazzled when Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) enters her life.  Juliet is impressed as well, because Pauline has a scar on her leg from an operation.  Juliet declares that: &quot;All the best people have had chest and bone disease! It's all frightfully romantic!&quot;  Eventually both the romance and the frightfullness of it all reaches a tragic conclusion.  In their all consuming friendship Juliet and Pauline create a &quot;Fourth World,&quot; better than heaven (because it has no Christians), inhabited by the clay figures they have fashioned to represents their friends and where the music of Mario Lanza, the greatest tenor on earth, is always in the air.Jackson brings this fantasy world alive, which allows him to explore the pivotal theme of juxtaposition throughout the film.  This comes into play most notably at the beginning and ending of &quot;Heavenly Clouds.&quot;  Jackson begins with a 1950s newsreel about Christchurch, New Zealand, which is interrupted by the appearance of the two screaming and bloodied girls, thereby symbolizing the way this sensational case shocked the nation.  Even more effective is the film's conclusion, where the murder is inter-cut with what the girls think will happen if they do not find this way of saving themselves.With any film based on historical events there are omissions, alterations, substitutions, and the like, and &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; is no different.  On the plus side of the ledger Jackson attempted an almost morbid verisimilitude.  Almost all of the locations used for filming were the real locations where events occurred, including the tea shop where Honora Parker ate her last meal, which was torn down a few days after the shooting ended.  However, the cast and crew found the actual murder scene uncomfortable and moved further down the path.  All of the journal voice-overs come directly from Pauline's diary, as are the characters in the girls' make-believe world.  However, since the two filled up fifteen notebooks and hundreds of letters devoted to their fantasies, the movie actually underplays these elements.However, having familiarized myself somewhat with the actual &quot;facts&quot; of the case, and the recollections of the woman one of the girls grew up to be, the key point of dispute is the motive.  But if Jackson is guilty of becoming fixated on the idea that these two young girl committed a murder because they could not bear to be separated and have their fantasy world unravel, then he can be hardly faulted for finding that a fascinating interpretation of the evidence (the girls never testified or were examined in court, but Pauline's diary was seen as providing all the answers).  More importantly, Jackson does not seem guilty of taking liberties, merely with offering a valid interpretation of the evidence.  For example, the murder sequence greatly reduces the number of blows, but the effect is still horrific, so it seems trivial to complain about any inaccuracy.From an artistic standpoint his interpretation is more than justified, especially at the end.  In addition to the information we receive between the final scene and the closing credits that tells what happened to Pauline and Juliet, Marzio Lanza sings &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone,&quot; which is as perfect a choice of a song to play at the end of a film as you will ever hear, forcefully underscoring the film's thesis.  Jackson says this is &quot;a murder story about love, a murder story with no villains,&quot; and it is hard to argue with this idea after watching his film.&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; received an Oscar nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Jackson and Frances Walsh.  The film won every award for which it was nominated in the New Zealand Film and TV Awards, including Best Actress for Lynskey and Best Foreign Performer for Winslet (both of whom were perfectly suited for those roles), and earned film festival awards in Venice and Toronto.  This is a striking and unforgettable film, both creative and thoughtful.  Those who are drawn to it because it was directed by Peter Jackson might be shocked by the subject matter, but they will not be disappointed with the results.",5,Peter Jackson's captivating murder

I wanted to see more of his work in another genre.HEAVENLY CREATURES is a wonderful and complex film.  Jackson (and cowriter Fran Walsh) takes what could be a salacious story (homosexuality, sex, and murder) and makes an amazingly surreal and touching film.  After the shootings in Columbine and other dastardly acts - including the two real-life New Zealand girls who are the subject of this story - Jackson gets into the state of mind of the youth.  The two New Zealand girls (played by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) are too consumed by their fantasy world to know right from wrong.  They are young and confused and their best recourse is their imaginations (incredible sequences with life-size clay people!).Jackson has created a very theatrical world in HEAVENLY CREATURES.  There are some hilarious filmatic references (including some funny bits about Orson Wells).  The characters are complex, though.  Jackson and Walsh made me understand WHY the girls chose to do what they did -- which doesn't make it right.  But the film makes no moral judgment (which I appreciate!), it only tells the girls' story.The DVD looks very good, with an excellent transfer of the film (although I noticed some scratches running down the right side of the frame in the early scenes!).I'm glad I finally saw HEAVENLY CREATURES.

Chlanda ""Miguelito""","[1, 2]","This movie, based on a true story, and set in New Zealand, during the 1950's; features the introductory performances of Kate Winslet (of numerous movies) and Melanie Lynskey (currently seen as Rose in Two And A Half Men).  It's a disturbing movie, about an &quot;unnatural&quot; friendship that develops and the &quot;fatal&quot; consequences for the mother of Lynskey's character.  As the two young women plot their murder, they develop a fantasy world; populated with older movie and music stars; including Orson Welles and Mario Lanza.  The man portraying a young Orson Welles was particularly, and unncanny was his resemblance, well cast. It was fairly sensual in places, which surprised me; given that there was little, if any nudity, although according to Craig Hosada, of the book &quot;The Bare Facts Guide&quot; there is, but it's brief, and may have been &quot;lost&quot; to &quot;modification&quot; for the smaller screen.  This doesn't detract too much from very emotional performances, by Winslet and Lynskey, [which made there characters very sad, at times, as they yelled and cried a lot] but also made them strangely sympathetic.  Winslet was clearly the more &quot;sophisticated&quot; one, but Ms. Lynskey held her own, as the plain[er] looking, but equally strange, highly emotional, young woman.  I'm not sure if a sequel would be in order, given that each is doing many different things now, but it would be an interesting idea to see them &quot;several years on&quot;.

374417,AUFK6UT2DU87H,6303433766,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[2, 2]","Truth is often much more enthralling than fiction.  This statement has never been more accurate than when examining Peter Jackson's unforgettable film, ""Heavenly Creatures."" Set during the early 1950's, this film explores the obsessive friendship and desperate loneliness of two young girls.In Christ Church, New Zealand, Pauline Reiper is an introverted 14-year-old who lives with her mother and father, Honora and Herbert.  The family runs a boardinghouse, and Pauline keeps to herself.Enter Juliet Hume, a flamboyant, romantically-minded, yet ultimately tormented girl from an upper-class family.  Her father, Henry, rector of Canterbury college, has moved his family to Christ Church.The two girls meet at school.  They find that they share many common interests: a love for opera, art, literature, and medieval life.  They also find that they were both afflicted with illness at young ages.  As the girls friendship progresses, they create an elaborate ""Fourth World,"" and a fantasy kingdom called Brovnia.  fantasy and reality merge with rapid frequency.  When the girls parents try to separate them, Pauline and Juliet lash out in the only way they feel they can.This movie grabs you from the very beginning.  Pauline's lower class life is wonderfully contrasted to Juliet's prestigious one.  Pauline comes from a family who truly loves her, (Sarah Paierce and Simon O'Connor turn in stellar performances as Pauline's parents), yet Juliet comes from a self-centered background.  Her parents are self-absorbed and rarely give Juliet the attention she craves.  Perhaps the most heartwrenching scene is the one where Juliet is abandoned by her parents when she is ill with tubercolosis.Mostly, we see the events unfold through Pauline's eyes.  She sees Juliet's life as ideal and longs to be a part of Juliet's family.  The script intersperses verbatim diary entries from Pauline that provide a glimps into her mind.  I especially liked the fact that the girls were not portrayed as helpless victims, but humans responsible for their actions.  None of the principle characters are ""cookie-cutter"" representations but real humans who struggle.  The portrayals are chilling yet also sympathetic.  Kate Winslet is excellent as Juliet.  Her over-the-top performance provides a glimpse into the mind of a wildly imaginative yet sad child.  Melanie Lynsky is superb as Pauline, and the viewer understands how the girls were drawn to each other in real life: they had such similar personalities.My only complaint about the film is the lesbian subplot and the treatment of Christianity.  I can understand why Juliet would have trouble believing God's love, especially when one considers the hypocrisy exhibited by her parents.  Juliet has been reported to say that she and Pauline were obsessive, but they never engaged in a sexual relationship.I just learned from researching the case that Juliet Hume is now writing under the name Anne Perry! I was absolutely astonished! Anne Perry's writing is excellent, and I am greatly comforted to know that both girls are free.  It is truly tragic that such young lives were ruined by irrational fear, and that a kindhearted woman lost her life.This film reminded me of the importance of being a good mentor to children.  We can all learn to give kids support and to be available to help them whenever possible.  Please give this enthralling film a chance.

Jackson gives us a bizarre, insightful, but ultimately, dissatisfying look at two young girls who think murder is the answer to all of their problems.  Knowing that one of the girls (Juliet) grew up to be acclaimed mystery novelist Anne Perry adds a sense of irony.  Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet give flawless performances, eliciting that awkward innocence of youth, but their chilling deviousness in plotting the murder of Lynskey's mother gives an underlying chill to this innocence.  Jackson's fantasy scenes are marvelous, presaging his finesse to come.  But can one really sympathize with these two girls?  I didn't...Lynskey's mother is nothing more than a concerned mother who has a right to question her daughter's rebellious behavior...she is no more callous or harsh than any one's mother.

Because of some scenes such as matricide and homosexual love, it was disturbing. However, as I watched this film again, I realized that I could see some things that I did not see at the first time. I began to see thing that are technical aspects of the film and disagreeable situations. In conclusion, I felt that this work is quite well made film. This work treats shocking materials but as this materials connect to fantasy of two girls in the middle of the film, it tone down intensity of the shocking. The notable features of this work are fantasy of two girls, and the beautiful music, which links girls&iexcl; s fantasy. Two girls like to hear Mario Lanza&iexcl;s song, and then they became to fall into their fantasy world. They gradually fell into the fantasy, so they could not distinguish between the reality and the fantasy and they began to look away their real life. Their friendship became to change into delicate feeling like a homosexual love. In this film, there is no direct expression about it, but I could feel it. After all, relationship of them made brutally murder of Pauline&iexcl;s mother. This is the most impact part of the film. by the way, the director Peter Jackson made it not particularly impact. He showed it step by step to explain why they committed a murder. This film is related to many genres such as love, fantasy, horror and psychodrama. All characters are described delicately to be shown shift of their emotion. This film is different from previous works of Peter Jackson, as it talked about reality. Pauline and Juliet made an imaginary kingdom and various characters. They thought that their fantasy is more important than real life. Their fantasy became to change reality, it was just not a story and writings. Then their fantasy was completed in their dream. They could come true everything what they want in dream.  Peter Jackson expressed their &iexcl;dream&iexcl; in this film. He described what they dream and indecent affairs that they did to realize their dream in real life. However, the boundary between the real life and the fantasy is obscure. The actual and the dream do not turn their back, they grasp their hand.

As evident through Jackson's other films, the director shows his similar interest by illustrating their fantasy world as they become closer. Strong macabre themes run through the film, as you simultaneously root for the girls? relationship and against what you know they eventually plan to do. Jackson skillfully balances this to create a mesmerizing film that you can't take your eyes off until the bloody end.Acting all around is note perfect, especially with the two girls played by Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet in her first film role. Everything works perfectly here to capture your attention. It?s clear how Jackson earned approval to make the risky Lord of the Rings project, because for the first time here, he shows how he can be a serious filmmaker with a load of talent.Heavenly Creatures is a must-see film.

374428,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6303433766,Reviewer,"[4, 5]","The true story of two teenaged girls living in New Zealand in the early `50s, ""Heavenly Creatures,"" directed by Peter Jackson, is a riveting, sometimes intense drama that examines the fast friendship between Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet), and the effects of that friendship, on not only themselves, but on their families and friends as well.  From a working class family, at fourteen, Pauline was shy and prone to introspection, recording her most intimate thoughts daily in a diary.  Originally from England, Juliet was the new girl in town; from a well-to-do family, she was well traveled, her father a professor of some stature.  Gregarious and outgoing, she was also given to flights of fancy, all of which appealed to Pauline immediately.  Brash and vivacious, Juliet was everything Pauline would never be; and Pauline was writing a novel, an endeavor in which Juliet quickly joined her.  Together, they would write and act out their romantic notions of brave knights and fair ladies, and Juliet shared with Pauline her knowledge of ""The Fourth World,"" a place to which she would one day go instead of heaven.  By the time they were fifteen, they were virtually inseparable.  They were ""best"" friends in every sense of the word.Director Jackson does a magnificent job of taking you into the world of Pauline and Juliet.  By contrasting the reality with the fantasy, he gives you an excellent sense of what they were all about, how they related to one another (as well as to others), and most importantly, their collective mind set which enabled them to actually embark upon their chosen path.  the girls' dream world is presented with a lyrical style that makes the happy times uplifting, and enhances the impact when things turn dark.  Throughout the film, passages are read verbatim from Pauline's diaries, which adds such stark realism to the events as they unfold, that in the end it produces a veritable sense of awe.  To see the things depicted here in a movie is one thing, but when you stop and think about the fact that two such ""normal"" young girls were capable of doing what they did, it is indeed sobering.  And when you learn what finally became of Pauline and Juliet, it merely adds to the incredulity of it all.This film marked the screen debuts of Winslet and Lynskey, and in Winslet's case, this film could have been subtitled ""A Star Is Born.""  From the opening frames, in which her talent, beauty and charismatic screen presence are readily apparent, there was no doubt as to the direction her career would soon be taking.  In retrospect, this was a great role with which to jump start her career, and she grabbed the opportunity with both hands and created a truly memorable character, using her natural poise and charm to the ultimate effect.  Winslet not only played the character, she discovered the spirit that moved Juliet and used it to the fullest extent to bring her to life here.  It's a genuinely auspicious and incredible performance.That Lynskey hasn't fared as well in her career as Winslet has since this film was made is in no way a reflection upon her performance in it.  Pauline is perfectly realized by Lynskey, but due to the more solemn nature of the character, it was almost as if she was predestined to be overshadowed here by Winslet.  But the credit for making the on screen relationship between the girls work so well, and the fact that it is so believable, has to be distributed equally between the two actresses.  And it was Lynskey's ability to evoke and surround herself with an ambience of darkness that allowed Winslet's light to shine so brightly.The supporting cast includes Sarah Peirse (Honora), Diana Kent (Hilda), Clive Merrison (Henry), Simon O'Connor (Herbert), Jed Brophy (John), Peter Elliott (Bill), Gilbert Goldie (Dr. Bennett) and Kirsti Ferry (Wendy).  Watching such extraordinary circumstances being played out so matter-of-factly by such seemingly ordinary people can be a thought provoking experience, but in the case of ""Heavenly Creatures,"" it's profoundly disturbing.  There's nothing quite so jarring as realizing the facility with which certain boundaries can in fact be traversed, and when it happens, it's like a slap in the face from reality.

There is a strong attraction between the two girls, and the film doesn't fudge the glint of lesbianism. In fact in its mocking treatment of the adults who try to label their friendship as ""unwholesome"", the film urges us to look beyond any tidy summaries.It is also refreshing to see a director respecting the complexity of each character's obsessions; the murderers are not necessarily driven by deliberate evil, but victims of turbulent imaginations themselves. Despite their crazy behaviour, we end up empathizing with them as well as the mother. In this regard, the three central performances by  Melanie Lynskey, Kate Winslet and Sarah Peirse are simply riveting.Jackson is now known for his 'Lord of the Ring' histrionics. The imagery in this film tells us why he reached that pinnacle.The DVD sadly is a bit sparse, devoid of the special features a film of this cadre so richly deserves, but the film itself is a pulse-pounding must-see of a murder yarn.

374432,A2WMEDQT6EL5FM,6303433766,"Shaz ""oi-you!""","[16, 18]","Pauline Rieper (New Zealand native Melanie Lynskey, ""Sweet Home Alabama"")has a dull and unhappy life at home with her family. And since none of the other girls at school understand her, she has no friends. The Hulme family moves in town from England, and their daughter Juliet (Winslet, who won the part over 175 other girls) clicks instantly with Pauline, especially since the girls share a love of literature and fantasy. In their creative minds, they begin to write about a ficticious world they want to be in; these parts of the film are shown with life-size versions of the clay model characters they make. Juliet and Pauline are inseperable, mainly because Juliet's wealthy parents always seem to be trying to ditch her, and Pauline is humiliated by her father and suffocated by her mother. But the girls parents, particularly Pauline's mother, begin to notice bizarre behavior from them, and decide that they need to see less of each other.  What else are two disturbed girls to do but conspire to kill the person that wants to keep them apart?Not only is this a true story, it came out in 1994, while Jackson (""Lord of the Rings"" fame) was filming this, that Juliet Hulme was actually mystery novel writer Anne Perry. Pauline Rieper was tracked down in 1997 in a run down cottage, apparently living under the name Hilary Nathan, and has since become a devout Catholic who spends her time helping handicapped children. Aparrently, they were eventually released from prison under the condition that they never see each other again. Jackson has an uncredited cameo, playing a bum that gets kissed by Winslet's character outside a theatre. All of the journal voice-overs are direct from real diary entries made by Pauline Rieper. Also, almost all locations used for filming were the genuine locations where the events occurred. The tea shop where Honorah Parker ate her last meal was knocked down a few days after the shoot ended. According to Jackson, when they got to the location of the murder on the dirt path, it was eerily quiet; the birds stopped singing, and it didn't seem right. So they moved along a couple of hundred yards.

374434,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,6303433766,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[1, 2]","Long before he found international success with THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and a fabulous remake of KING KONG, Peter Jackson made the brilliant and unforgettable HEAVENLY CREATURES (1994, New Zealand).  The source is the shocking and scary Parker-Hulme murder case in 1954 Christchurch that galvanized New Zealand.  The case is less well known in the United States, and a gorgeous new letterboxed DVD has no bonus material [....]I don't know how much plot to give away here, except to say that the film ends with a violent crime that is hinted at in the opening scene when teenagers Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme (an auspicious film debut for both Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) come running out of a forest covered in blood and saying someone is dead.  We then flash back to 1952 and work our way forward to a 1954 finale.  The movie was filmed in Panavision (by Alun Bollinger) in rich yellows and oranges as the two girls develop a deep friendship that includes kisses and baths together.  The two are very different.  Pauline is shy and inward, while Juliet is open and sophisticated.  The daughter of a university professor, Juliet has been all over the world at age 15 and suffers from tuberculosis.  Pauline is a quiet wallflower who has never left New Zealand.The more their parents and teachers worry about their friendship, the more Juliet and Pauline retreat inside a fantasy world of claymation figures, gorgeous gardens, and Mario Lanza records.  In that fantasy world, Juliet is nicknamed ""Devora"" and Pauline is called ""Yvonne"" or ""Gina"".  I adore a musical number in the fantasy world, with the girls dancing to Mario singing ""The Loveliest Night of the Year."" (It is the real Lanza on real records throughout the film.)  Yellows and oranges blend with scary blues on nighttime interiors.  Writers Jackson and Frances Walsh got an Oscar nomination for their Original Screenplay.  I like the way teen sex in the real world is juxtaposed against religion and murder in the fantasy world.And I like the way colors contrast  and the way the real world of early 1950's Christchurch contrasts with the fantasy world of WETA design clay figures.  The technical credits will be very familiar to anyone who has seen a LORD OF THE RINGS movie--editor Jamie Selkirk, costumer Ngila Dickson, writers Jackson and Walsh (husband and wife), production designer Grant Major, and others.  It's a beautifully made movie.The ending packs a shocking jolt, even when you can guess what will happen.  It will haunt you for days afterwards and give you many sleepless nighs.  HEAVENLY CREATURES deserves its ""R"" rating (for violence and sexual content).  Juliet has to go to South Africa with Dad for her health (lung tuberculosis), which gets Pauline distraught and even suicidal.  She has a frighteningly amoral solution.  ""It can be an accident,"" she rationalizes.  ""People die every day.""  So a crime will take place.  End crawls with a haunting Lanza rendition of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" say the girls were too young for the death penalty, so they were imprisoned until adulthood, then ordered never to see or write to one another again.  That's a rough punishment for these two.Fascinatingly, it was divulged that Juliet and Pauline were taking anti-depressant drugs that have long since been banned from the market.  (I have mental illness myself and would love to know what the drugs were.  I'm sure my doctors would like to know also.)  And Juliet's story at least has a happy ending:  she surfaced several decades later in Scotland, where she currently writes murder mysteries under the name ""Anne Perry"".  I've read a couple of the novels, and they are outstanding.  So I am glad she was not executed in 1954.  I may be wrong, I'd have to check the web site.  But I think Pauline moved to England and found religion as an adult; that is not confirmed.What a movie HEAVENLY CREATURES is for mature adults who feel up to its bloodbath finale.  It is flawlessly made, with gorgeous color and wide-screen, fascinating blendings of reality and fantasy that eventually become one for Juliet and Pauline.  It is chilling stuff, a true-life crime case.  It is fascinating to see the enormously talented Kate Winslet as a teenager at the start of a magnificent career; she was born an actress.  And it is interesting to see what Peter Jackson was up to before LORD OF THE RINGS.The new DVD of CREATURES is the uncut 109 minute Director's Cut, never before seen in the United States.  The original American version ran 99 minutes.  I had also never seen the movie in Panavision since 1994 in a theater.  It really needs to be experienced in wide-screen format.  Seen uncut and in wide-screen in a night bedroom, I love CREATURES more than the cold LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, if not more than the wondrous KING KONG.  It is a must for the mature members of the Winslet and Jackson fan clubs.",5,A chilling and disturbing true-crime film,1179360000,"05 17, 2007",2007,4894,"['Long', 'found', 'international', 'success',

The film gives a fair share of the culpability to the parents, though in the true spirit of class warfare, the uppercrust family-which includes a stodgy university cuckold and his hedonistic wife, a marriage counselor whose therapy technique includes bedding her charges-escapes with the least harm, even if it deserves the greatest amount of blame.  It is the ""poor,"" dark-haired girl, with all that bad blue-collar blood, that instigates the ultimate crime, her mother, perhaps the only truly sympathetic character, the one who pays the ultimate price.  Director Peter Jackson weaves Terry Gilliam-esque fantasy sequences with even stranger real events, the results being an unsettlingly colorful film whose low-budget and sparse production seem to enhance rather than detract from the all-too-true story.  Still the film's sequences often walk, sometimes trip over a fine line between camp and drama, with Winslett in particular delivering performances that are so affected they frequently grate on the nerves.  The film works best when it shows the breeziness of young girls and the happiness the leads find in each other's company and arms; it's worst when it tries to generate any real sympathy for them.  Ultimately, their crime is senseless and misdirected, and one is left at the end with a feeling that we've been bamboozled into caring about them in the first place.",3,Yet Another Dysfunctional Family Movie,1044576000,"02 7, 2003",2003,1826,"['yet', 'late-20th-century', 'examination', 'paradox', 'WASP', 'families', 'failing', 'work', 'properly', 'yet', 'somehow', 'nonetheless', 'proliferating', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'by-now', 'familiar', 'set', 'dysfunctional', 'selfish', 'characters', 'careening', 'disaster', 'Here', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'are', 'creatures', 'question', 'two', 'odd', 'angst-ridden', 'teenagers', '1950s', 'New', 'Zealand', 'mutual', 'affection', 'creepy', 'fantasy', 'lead', 'murder', 'film', 'fair', 'share', 'culpability', 'parents', 'true', 'spirit', 'class', 'warfare', 'uppercrust', 'family-which', 'stodgy', 'university', 'cuckold', 'hedonistic', 'wife', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'therapy', 'technique', 'bedding', 'charges-escapes', 'least', 'harm', 'even', 'greatest', 'amount', 'blame', 'poor', 'dark-haired', 'girl', 'bad', 'blue-collar', 'blood', 'ultimate', 'crime', 'mother', 'perhaps', 'only', 'truly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'ultimate', 'price', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Terry', 'Gilliam-esque', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'even', 'stranger', 'real', 'events', 'results', 'being', 'unsettlingly', 'colorful', 'film', 'low-budget', 'sparse', 'production', 'seem', 'enhance', 'rather', 'detract', 'all-too-true', 'story', 'Still', 'film', 'sequences', 'often', 'walk', 'sometimes', 'trip', 'fine', 'line', 'camp', 'drama', 'Winslett', 'particular', 'delivering', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'affected', 'frequently', 'grate', 'nerves', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'breeziness', 'young', 'girls', 'happiness', 'leads', 'find', 'other', 'company', 'arms', 'worst', 'when', 'generate', 'real', 'sympathy', 'Ultimately', 'crime', 'senseless', 'misdirected', 'one', 'left', 'end', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bamboozled', 'caring', 'first', 'place']",Heavenly Creatures VHS

But you'd still be painfully close to it..Peter Jackson does some gracious wasting of celluloid by showing us ethereal dancing scenes that contribute zilch to the plot. Whenever he runs out of choreography he throws in some hallucinatory visuals hoping this will distract ya from asking ""hey, dude, where's my movie?"", but, nonetheless ""Heavenly creatures"" remains a draggy affair with only one huge positive: it only lasts a merciful one and a half hour..Now, this is not to say that the story actually implied in this film is not good. I'm sure that in real life (this is based on a true story) these two female characters were indeed tremendously interesting and brave for defying the ""morals"" of the tragically puritan society they lived in. And I'm positive in thinking that their homosexual affair did stir the murky waters of their ultra-conservative environs. I'm also quite sure that their story, their real life story, was definately worth narrating and even filming.However, we'll have to wait patiently on, until someone else, with less tendencies for the pointlessly absurd and abstract, refilms this. Because what Lord of the Yawns-director has done here was not worth the sleep i fought not falling into..Unless you're a total beginner in the  sport of film-viewing, i advise ya to try something else.

374439,A1B22L23YH8CDW,6303433766,"""tierneyfan""","[21, 23]","A unique masterpiece, which infuses ingenious camera techniques, solid acting, and a well-adapted script.  Stars Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey in their film debuts.  Both show promise and this film is more Lynskey's than Winslet's, but Lynskey has yet to become a household name (she will sooner or later).  This film is based on the most celebrated trial in placid New Zealand, the Parker-Hulme case, which concerned the girls' murder of one of their mothers in the 1950's. What's intriguing about it is that one of the girls (Hulme) turns out to be the celebrated mystery writer, Anne Perry.Winslet plays Juliet Hulme, an English debutante who moves to Christchurch, New Zealand when her father becomes the Rector of the town's college.  As a child she suffered from tuberculosis and like the stereotypical upper-crust English, her parents neglected her by abandoning her in the Caribbean.  She strikes up a friendship with the class wallflower, Pauline Parker, a girl of a lower socio-economic background, who also suffered from a childhood illness and felt outcast.  They soon become best friends and pursue their interests in writing stories and listening to opera to escape their mundane surroundings.  Scarily, their imagination takes over and they lose touch with reality.  Their emotional dependence on each other frightens their parents, who fear their daughters have developed homosexual feelings for each other.  As a solution, they attempt to separate the girls.  Juliet is to live in South Africa with her relatives and Pauline is not granted a passport.  The girls view Pauline's mother (Sarah Peirse) as the main obstacle of staying together.  They hatch a plan to kill her and make it look like an accident.The director, Peter Jackson, presents the story from the girls' perspective.  The viewer is sucked into their visually rich fantasy-world, and one sympathizes with their plight.  One understands the girls' disillusionment with their parents, when Juliet discovers her mother (Diana Kent) is having an affair with a married man.  Pauline's parents, it is discovered during the trial, were never married.  In fact, her father was still legally married to his first wife.  Jackson, who understandably was the perfect director to direct Lord of the Rings, utilizes clay animation, timely editing and angular use of the camera.  And most important of all is the script, based mostly on Pauline Parker's diaries written during the two year period leading up to the horrifying crime.  The result is the most original film in decades.FYI, the girls were released when they turned 21 years old on condition that they never meet.  Perry, who took her stepfather's surname, her stepfather being the man her mother was having an affair with, currently resides in Scotland.  Surprisingly and coincidentally, so does Parker, although they have yet to meet again.  They both are doing what they dreamed of when they met-Perry writing books and Parker riding horses (she runs a horseback riding academy).  Perry, who lived in the US for a number is years, is a devout Mormon and Parker is a devout Catholic.  They both eschewed religion as teenagers.",5,The Best Film of the 90's,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,3161,"['unique', 'masterpiece', 'ingenious', 'camera', 'techniques', 'solid', 'acting', 'well-adapted', 'script', 'Stars', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'film', 'debuts', 'show', 'promise', 'film', 'more', 'Lynskey', 'Winslet', 'Lynskey', 'yet', 'become', 'household', 'name', 'will', 'sooner', 'later', 'film', 'based', 'most', 'celebrated', 'trial', 'placid', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Parker-Hulme', 'case', 'concerned', 'girls', 'murder', 'one', 'mothers', '1950', 'What', 'intriguing', 'one', 'girls', 'Hulme', 'out', 'be', 'celebrated', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Anne', 'Perry.Winslet', 'Juliet', 'Hulme', 'English', 'debutante', 'who', 'Christchurch', 'New', 'Zealand', 'when', 'father', 'Rector', 'town', 'college', 'child', 'suffered', 'tuberculosis', 'stereotypical', 'upper-crust', 'English', 'parents', 'neglected', 'abandoning', 'Caribbean', 'up', 'friendship', 'class', 'wallflower', 'Pauline', 'Parker', 'girl', 'lower', 'socio-economic', 'background', 'who', 'also', 'suffered', 'childhood', 'illness', 'felt', 'outcast', 'soon', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'pursue', 'interests', 'writing', 'stories', 'listening', 'opera', 'escape', 'mundane', 'surroundings', 'Scarily', 'imagination', 'lose', 'touch', 'reality', 'emotional', 'dependence', 'other', 'frightens', 'parents', 'who', 'fear', 'daughters', 'have', 'developed', 'homosexual', 'feelings', 'other', 'solution', 'attempt', 'separate', 'girls', 'Juliet', 'live', 'South', 'Africa', 'relatives', 'Pauline', 'not', 'granted', 'passport', 'girls', 'view', 'Pauline', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Peirse', 'main', 'obstacle', 'staying', 'together', 'hatch', 'plan', 'kill', 'make', 'look', 'accident.The', 'director', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'story', 'girls', 'perspective', 'viewer', 'sucked', 'visually', 'rich', 'fantasy-world', 'one', 'sympathizes', 'plight', 'One', 'girls', 'disillusionment', 'parents', 'when', 'Juliet', 'discovers', 'mother', 'Diana', 'Kent', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'man', 'Pauline', 'parents', 'discovered', 'trial', 'were', 'never', 'married', 'fact', 'father', 'was', 'still', 'legally', 'married', 'first', 'wife', 'Jackson', 'who', 'understandably', 'was', 'perfect', 'director', 'direct', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'utilizes', 'clay', 'animation', 'timely', 'editing', 'angular', 'use', 'camera', 'most', 'important', 'script', 'based', 'mostly', 'Pauline', 'Parker', 'diaries', 'written', 'two', 'year', 'period', 'leading', 'up', 'horrifying', 'crime', 'result', 'most', 'original', 'film', 'decades.FYI', 'girls', 'were', 'released', 'when', 'turned', '21', 'years', 'old', 'condition', 'never', 'meet', 'Perry', 'who', 'took', 'stepfather', 'surname', 'stepfather', 'being', 'man', 'mother', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'currently', 'Scotland', 'Surprisingly', 'coincidentally', 'so', 'Parker', 'have', 'yet', 'meet', 'again', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'dreamed', 'when', 'met-Perry', 'writing', 'books', 'Parker', 'riding', 'horses', 'horseback', 'riding', 'academy', 'Perry', 'who', 'lived', 'US', 'number', 'years', 'devout', 'Mormon', 'Parker', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'eschewed', 'religion', 'teenagers']",Heavenly Creatures VHS

374441,A18C1PCR8WUAST,6303433766,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[18, 25]","BE WARNED! THIS IS NOT THE FILM YOU SAW IN THE THEATRE!Much to my surprise, this arrived with the small words ""uncut version"" on the cover, and to my dismay, this was not a good thing. Peter Jackson's brilliant film, which gave Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey what may be the two best debut roles ever for young women, was a non-stop roller-coaster ride of mounting hysteria that mirrored the increasing intensity of the girls' relationship. This friendship between Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker, which became deeply emotional, sexual, and ultimately so co-dependent that they simply could not tolerate the notion of separation, culminated in the violent murder of Pauline's mother, with the two girls bashing her head in repeatedly with a brick inside of a stocking(the scene is gruesome, but still understates reality, which is a shocking thing to learn). This crime shocked the quiet community of Christchurch, New Zealand so completely that Jackson starts his film with a propoganda movie the town had made to lure new residents, in order to give us an idea of what sort of place this was. He then begins to fade in screams of the girls, shots of their blood-streaked faces, and we are as shocked by the violence as the town was then (1954). In order to understand and sympathize with these girls, not an easy thing for a director to accomplish given the violence of their crime and the inability of such smart girls to find any other way to deal with their terror of separation, Jackson gets deep inside their heads very effectively, and more than sharing their fantasy world with us, takes us into it. And by keeping the pace of the film pumping along with such speed and focus that we feel the girls' pain, too, and almost in spite of ourselves, are completely in sympathy with their decision (although afterwards, we shake ourselves back into rationality, and wonder why they came to such a desperate conclusion), we accept the racing towards inevitability that they seemed to have felt. The tension and intensity are incredible, and without it, the film would never have worked.The original cut of ""Heavenly Creatures"" gave us what we needed to maintain within ourselves this hysteria and to see from their points of view without stopping to question. This ""uncut version"" destroys that completely. It contains a 10-15 minute section that doesn't exist in the theatrical release, and which stops the film dead. The scenes are also longer, there's more dialogue in some, more time in ""The Fourth World"" (their fantasy world), and the editing is considerably less elegant. While some of these scenes add to our understanding of the girls, especially the rather bizarre details of Juliet's family life, and are therefore interesting to see, it's not the cut I'll watch again and again, as I do the original. It just doesn't work, and sadly, unless you realize that this wasn't the work of genius everyone was raving about, you'll wonder why we were raving about it. I don't believe anyone would have raved about this version, especially as the anguish of the ending is wrecked by an incredibly bad editing decision. Certainly I would not have raved about it, even if I could have seen its potential for genius.It is very frustrating that now one can only get this version--there isn't even a choice between the two. I don't understand why this wasn't released in a two-sided or two-disk ""pick a version"" manner, or the extended/deleted scenes shown as ""deleted scenes"" often are on the original DVD. That this is the only choice now is infuriating, especially as, with no warning, one may discover it as I did, watching the opening sequence and thinking, ""Wait a minute...I don't remember this..."" While not everyone is like me with a photographic memory that genuinely knows films by heart, even noticing a different single edit in a scene if the film shows up on TV, most who loved this film will realize they're watching something different, and probably will only notice it after it's in the DVD player, making getting credit for a return more of a challenge. But the fact that this is not the original version is not, in my opinion, sufficiently explained in the information on the DVD info page. That this is NOT the original version should be shouted, as unlike ""Apocalypse Now Redux,"" it is not re-titled.The comparison to ""Apocalypse Now"" is actually an appropriate one. In the Redux version, we can see scenes that add background about Vietnam (the presence of old French colonialist families still living there, for example), interesting conversations, etc., but its pace is deadly, and as with ""Heavenly Creatures"" we need to be on a voyage of inevitability, moving relentlessly towards the mysterious Kurtz. Without this ever-mounting tension, it's not the work of genius that the original cut is. But we have choices between the two, and that's as it should be. Why the extra and extended scenes in ""HC"" weren't just in a ""deleted scenes"" section on the original disk is a mystery, but this poor replacement is a disappointment that now is the only version first-time viewers can see without buying second-hand. Bad, bad call.A note: Editing is everything. Everything. I learnt how to build a film from my editing teacher (who became my editor); it's in the editing that the film is either made or broken, and obviously Jackson knew that, and made all the right choices with his editor the first time around. Why he ruined his own work is a question someone should ask him. Please, if you can, check out the documentary, ""The Cutting Edge: The Magic of Editing"" to see what this final piece of a film project really consists of.",2,"Not the original cut! 5 stars for

374443,A35NVOZDHB4NXN,6303433766,"""valeska_""","[4, 4]","Taking place in the 1950's in Christchurch New Zealand. Heavenly Creatures is based on a true story about the intense bond of two girls Pauline Yvonne Rieper and Juliet Hulme.I think for Pauline in particular this friendship is very important. Pauline is moody person, an introvert of very strong character, kind of a tom boy, with short black unruly curls.Her father runs a fish shop, and her mother is a house wife, their working-class home also doubles as a boarding house.She may have feelings of inadequetcy, because of scars on her legs, leaving them brittle, from a childhood illness. But when she meets Juliet Hulme it seems she's met her soul mate.Juliet is an extrovert, worldly and outspoken, she even corrects the French teacher on her first day.Juliet is impressed with Pauline's scars, she has scars too, on her lungs from a childhood bout with tuberculosis.Juliet's parents left her in the Bahamas &quot;for the good of her health&quot; and she didn't see them for five whole years. Juliet tells Pauline &quot;All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases, it's all frightfully romantic!&quot;Pauline finds refuge at Juliet's enormous upper-class house, where they play and obsess in their made-up world of Borovnia, they write about the escapades of their imaginary alter egos and their fantasy family. Juliet becomes Deborah and Pauline becomes Gina (a beautiful gypsy). and they revel in the music of Mario Lanza, the worlds greatest tenor!But Juliets parents seem rather cold and aloof. Her mother is a marriage counselor, she has a special technique called &quot;deep therapy&quot;.And her father is an esteemed University rector. He is the first to question the intensity of Pauline and Juliet's relationship. He suggests to the Riepers that Pauline may be growing in a &quot;wayward&quot; fashion and suggests a psychiatrist.However, Pauline seems oblivious to this. She thinks of Mr. Hulme. as the kindest man she's ever known.Pauline begins to grow desperate, at the idea that someone may try to come in between her and Juliet, particularly her mother. Who seems to grow concerned at Pauline's total obsession with her stories (and uninterest in school) and especially after a short affair with a male boarder, their relationship is rocky.Whereas Pauline truly has loving parents, her friendship with Juliet is so important to her, it seems to have altered her reality. And the tension builds when Juliet's parrents announce they are getting divorced and Mr. Hulme is taking Juliet and her brother to South Africa.The story is absolutely true.The narration of the film was taken directly from the actual diaries entries of Pauline, which was discovered buried in her backyard by the police. And Peter Jackson, said he filmed most of the scenes in the actual location of the real events.Melanie Lynsky who portrays Pauline, is MAGNIFICENT! Her performance in fantastic, and seems so real.Those scenes in which she cries, are so excruiating to watch, because she's actually sobbing, and at the same time it's just facinating.She's also very charming. I think you'll like her right away.Kate Winslet is also wonderful. This must have been he first film for each of them, because in the opening sequence is says &quot;and introducing Melanie Lynsky &amp; Kate Winslet&quot;Filmed in Christchurch New Zealand, Heavenly Creatures is a FACINATING and an absolutely ENGROSSING film. If you like movie of &quot;dark&quot; genre, you'll be awe-struck.As an interesting side note, The girls were spared harsh punishment because of their ages. Juliet Hulme, changed her name to Anne Perry and is now a writer (of fictional crime) Anne Perry herself admits this. There has been speculation as to what has become of Pauline. But one source says, she changed her name to Hilary Nathan and is an ex-librarian, devout Catholic (almost became a nun) and now runs a riding school in rural England. This is from NZ (New Zealand) Woman's Weekly magazine 1997 in an article written by Chris Cooke.This is an excellent film, and I'm glad to see it's now on DVD, I know there was a petition going around to get it released, I signed it. :-)This is the Uncut version.",5,HEAVENLY CREATURES,1043020800,"01 20, 2003",2003,4174,"['Taking', 'place', '1950', 'Christchurch', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'intense', 'bond', 'two', 'girls', 'Pauline', 'Yvonne', 'Rieper', 'Juliet', 'Hulme.I', 'think', 'Pauline', 'particular', 'friendship', 'very', 'important', 'Pauline', 'moody', 'person', 'introvert', 'very', 'strong', 'character', 'kind', 'tom', 'boy', 'short', 'black', 'unruly', 'curls.Her', 'father', 'fish', 'shop', 'mother', 'house', 'wife', 'working-class', 'home', 'also', 'boarding', 'house.She', 'may', 'have', 'feelings', 'inadequetcy', 'scars', 'legs', 'leaving', 'brittle', 'childhood', 'illness', 'when', 'Juliet', 'Hulme', 'met', 'soul', 'mate.Juliet', 'extrovert', 'worldly', 'even', 'French', 'teacher', 'first', 'day.Juliet', 'impressed', 'Pauline', 'scars', 'scars', 'too', 'lungs', 'childhood', 'bout', 'tuberculosis.Juliet', 'parents', 'left', 'Bahamas', 'quot', 'good', 'health', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'five', 'whole', 'years', 'Juliet', 'Pauline', 'quot', 'best', 'people', 'have', 'bad', 'chests', 'bone', 'diseases', 'frightfully', 'romantic', 'quot', 'Pauline', 'refuge', 'Juliet', 'enormous', 'upper-class', 'house', 'where', 'play', 'obsess', 'made-up', 'world', 'Borovnia', 'write', 'escapades', 'imaginary', 'alter', 'egos', 'fantasy', 'family', 'Juliet', 'Deborah', 'Pauline', 'Gina', 'beautiful', 'gypsy', 'revel', 'music', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'worlds', 'greatest', 'tenor', 'Juliets', 'parents', 'seem', 'rather', 'cold', 'aloof', 'mother', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'special', 'technique', 'called', 'quot', 'deep', 'therapy', 'quot', 'father', 'esteemed', 'University', 'rector', 'first', 'question', 'intensity', 'Pauline', 'Juliet', 'relationship', 'Riepers', 'Pauline', 'may', 'be', 'growing', 'quot', 'quot', 'fashion', 'psychiatrist.However', 'Pauline', 'oblivious', 'Mr.', 'Hulme', 'kindest', 'man', 'ever', 'known.Pauline', 'begins', 'grow', 'desperate', 'idea', 'someone', 'may', 'try', 'come', 'Juliet', 'particularly', 'mother', 'Who', 'grow', 'concerned', 'Pauline', 'total', 'obsession', 'stories', 'uninterest', 'school', 'especially', 'short', 'affair', 'male', 'boarder', 'relationship', 'rocky.Whereas', 'Pauline', 'truly', 'loving', 'parents', 'friendship', 'Juliet', 'so', 'important', 'have', 'altered', 'reality', 'tension', 'when', 'Juliet', 'parrents', 'are', 'getting', 'divorced', 'Mr.', 'Hulme', 'taking', 'Juliet', 'brother', 'South', 'Africa.The', 'story', 'absolutely', 'true.The', 'narration', 'film', 'was', 'taken', 'directly', 'actual', 'diaries', 'entries', 'Pauline', 'was', 'discovered', 'buried', 'backyard', 'police', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'said', 'filmed', 'most', 'scenes', 'actual', 'location', 'real', 'events.Melanie', 'Lynsky', 'who', 'Pauline', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'performance', 'fantastic', 'so', 'real.Those', 'scenes', 'cries', 'are', 'so', 'excruiating', 'watch', 'actually', 'sobbing', 'same', 'time', 'just', 'facinating.She', 'also', 'very', 'charming', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'right', 'away.Kate', 'Winslet', 'also', 'wonderful', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'quot', 'introducing', 'Melanie', 'Lynsky', 'amp', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'quot', 'Filmed', 'Christchurch', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'FACINATING', 'absolutely', 'ENGROSSING', 'film', 'like', 'movie', 'quot', 'dark', 'quot', 'genre', ""'ll"", 'be', 'awe-struck.As', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'girls', 'were', 'spared', 'harsh', 'punishment', 'ages', 'Juliet', 'Hulme', 'changed', 'name', 'Anne', 'Perry', 'now', 'writer', 'fictional', 'crime', 'Anne', 'Perry', 'been', 'speculation', 'what', 'become', 'Pauline', 'one', 'source', 'changed', 'name', 'Hilary', 'Nathan', 'ex-librarian', 'Catholic', 'almost', 'became', 'nun', 'now', 'riding', 'school', 'rural', 'England', 'NZ', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Woman', 'Weekly', 'magazine', '1997', 'article', 'written', 'Chris', 'Cooke.This', 'excellent', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'now', 'DVD', 'know', 'was', 'petition', 'going', 'around', 'get', 'released', 'signed', 'Uncut', 'version']",Heavenly Creatures VHS

For the most part Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) followed Juliet's (Kate Winslet's) lead.  It seems that a lot of the reviews put 60% of the blame on Pauline because she's the dark, gloomy one, but really the wholesome Juliet had the more screwed up family life and outlook; especially when it came to her own abandonment issues.  Pauline was a perfect sounding board for Juliet's poor family life.  And as the friendship and teen pressures increased, both girls literally got lost in a world all their own.

Director Peter Jackson chose to tell a fictionalized version of what occurred in 1954 for his first serious and mainstream films ""Heavenly Creatures"" a film that displays his remarkable ability to tell suspenseful stories while also handling the fantasy elements exceptionally well.Featuring Kate Winslet in one of her earliest roles as Juliet Hulme and Melanie Lynskey as Pauline Rieper, the film nicely captures the flavor of the 50's and the often represssive atmosphere that existed at the time. Both actresses do exceptional jobs in their roles and the supporting cast give marvelous supporting performances.The Blu-ray looks quite nice but keep in mind that the film was shot intentionally ""soft"" particularly during the fantasy sequences of the film. Detail is stronger here than the older DVD and there are nice textures throughout while color looks terrific and isn't oversaturated.The audio likewise has some limitations but the 2.0 DTS lossless sound is extremely good--there's loads of detail and dialogue comes across with good clarity.My only complaint is that Lion's Gate has chosen NOT to include any special features. As I recall there was a short documentary produced for this film and that certainly should have been included. It's also disappointing that Lion's Gate either didn't ask for(or Jackson chose not to provide) a commentary track.
