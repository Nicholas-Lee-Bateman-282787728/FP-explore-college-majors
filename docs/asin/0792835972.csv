I liked this movie because it wasn't a &quot;chick flick.&quot;  As many of Hepburn's movies do, Adam's Rib demands the equality of women.  However, it  does not go too far- it demands equality for women, not special treatment.  The movie is also interesting to see nowadays as it presents the situation  of women back in the 40s, shows how far we have come, and yet how far we  still have yet to go.  One thought I had though- on the idea of  homewrecking and how terrible it is for men to cheat on their wives- didn't  Tracy cheat on his wife for his committed relationship with Hepburn?",4,"Battle of the Sexes, Round 1",946684800,"01 1, 2000",2000,659,"['love', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'perfection', 'movie', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'quot', 'flick.', 'quot', 'many', 'Hepburn', 'movies', 'do', 'Adam', 'Rib', 'equality', 'women', 'However', 'not', 'go', 'too', 'far-', 'equality', 'women', 'not', 'special', 'treatment', 'movie', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'nowadays', 'situation', 'women', 'back', '40s', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come', 'yet', 'how', 'far', 'still', 'have', 'yet', 'go', 'One', 'thought', 'had', 'though-', 'idea', 'homewrecking', 'how', 'terrible', 'men', 'cheat', 'wives-', 'did', ""n't"", 'Tracy', 'cheat', 'wife', 'committed', 'relationship', 'Hepburn']",N/A

136663,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792835972,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","One of those films that I just totally adored from start to finish, `Adam's Rib' is a fantastic romantic comedy that thrives on its stellar cast and smart scripting.  Even when the film starts to fray towards the end (this may be a personal opinion, but I found the last few minutes to be rather off-putting and unnecessary), it never truly leaves the audience.The film is exciting and fun and just all around pure entertainment!Hepburn and Tracy (I love Spencer Tracy SOOOOO much) play Adam and Amanda Bonner, husband and wife lawyers who wind up on opposite ends of a court room when jilted wife Doris Attinger shoots her philandering husband and his lover (she doesn't actually wound the lover).  Adam is handed the prosecution of the case, but his wife (who firmly believes that this is her chance to rally the equality of women) takes the defense and together they turn the courtroom (and their marriage) on its head.The acting across the board is phenomenal.  Hepburn and Tracy worked a lot with one another, and it is obvious why.  They really have such undeniable chemistry, and here they play off one another so beautifully.  Hepburn has the more triumphant and stirring moments, but Tracy, for me, is the standout of the two.  He really understands the quieter moments and plays them to perfection.  Even in the films final frames, where I see the script starting to lose steam, he manages to make his character so likable and memorable that you can't help but forgive the scene.But, and I mean this in a BIG way, the film's grandest performance comes from the GLORIOUS Judy Holliday.  What I love so much about this performance is that it feels so modern in its approach.  I mean, there is no doubt in my mind that that very performance can be seen in a film today, and that is saying a lot since the whole style and craft of acting has changed a lot since the 40's.  It lacks the overtly theatrical stylings of the day and instead layers the character with a sharp sense of pure naturalism.Holliday is flawless!So, the film is really a rich and entertaining ride.  With the ethics of law, love and equality all thrown on the cutting board, `Adam's Rib' really covers a lot of ground.  Instead of coming across as hurried and stuffed though, the film covers that ground very nicely.  Sure, it doesn't really come together on all areas, but the bell was sounded and the players all came to the rescue, delivering something that is the epitome of entertainment.",5,SO.MUCH.FUN.,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,2470,"['One', 'films', 'just', 'totally', 'adored', 'start', 'finish', 'Adam', 'Rib', 'fantastic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'stellar', 'cast', 'smart', 'scripting', 'Even', 'when', 'film', 'fray', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'personal', 'opinion', 'found', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'be', 'rather', 'off-putting', 'unnecessary', 'never', 'truly', 'audience.The', 'film', 'exciting', 'fun', 'just', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'Hepburn', 'Tracy', 'love', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'SOOOOO', 'much', 'play', 'Adam', 'Amanda', 'Bonner', 'husband', 'wife', 'lawyers', 'who', 'wind', 'up', 'opposite', 'ends', 'court', 'room', 'when', 'jilted', 'wife', 'Doris', 'Attinger', 'shoots', 'philandering', 'husband', 'lover', ""n't"", 'actually', 'wound', 'lover', 'Adam', 'handed', 'prosecution', 'case', 'wife', 'who', 'firmly', 'chance', 'rally', 'equality', 'women', 'defense', 'together', 'turn', 'courtroom', 'marriage', 'head.The', 'acting', 'board', 'phenomenal', 'Hepburn', 'Tracy', 'worked', 'lot', 'one', 'obvious', 'why', 'really', 'have', 'such', 'undeniable', 'chemistry', 'here', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'so', 'beautifully', 'Hepburn', 'more', 'triumphant', 'stirring', 'moments', 'Tracy', 'standout', 'two', 'really', 'quieter', 'moments', 'perfection', 'Even', 'films', 'final', 'frames', 'where', 'see', 'script', 'starting', 'lose', 'steam', 'make', 'character', 'so', 'likable', 'memorable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'forgive', 'scene.But', 'mean', 'BIG', 'way', 'film', 'grandest', 'performance', 'GLORIOUS', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'What', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'performance', 'so', 'modern', 'approach', 'mean', 'doubt', 'mind', 'very', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'today', 'saying', 'lot', 'whole', 'style', 'craft', 'acting', 'changed', 'lot', '40', 'overtly', 'theatrical', 'stylings', 'day', 'instead', 'character', 'sharp', 'sense', 'pure', 'naturalism.Holliday', 'flawless', 'So', 'film', 'really', 'rich', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'ethics', 'law', 'love', 'equality', 'thrown', 'cutting', 'board', 'Adam', 'Rib', 'really', 'lot', 'ground', 'Instead', 'coming', 'hurried', 'stuffed', 'film', 'ground', 'very', 'nicely', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'together', 'areas', 'bell', 'was', 'sounded', 'players', 'came', 'rescue', 'delivering', 'something', 'epitome', 'entertainment']",N/A

Brightly written (by Ruth  Gordon and Garson Kanin), it takes the premise of the trial of a wife (the  sparkling Judy Holliday, in her film debut) shooting her unfaithful husband  (Tom Ewell, establishing himself in the kind of role he'd reprise in The  Seven-Year Itch), and turns it into a forum for sexual values in the '40s,  and a showcase for the fabulous Tracy and Hepburn. The two were never  better than as the battling D.A. and defense attorney. In the courtroom and  out, the love they share, and tweaking of each other's egos, is a sheer joy  to watch. That the story is also a knowing commentary about women's  inequality under the law makes the film even more topical today, and  doesn't reduce the film's enjoyment value at all. It is a VERY funny film,  and can be enjoyed at MANY levels!

Maybe these issues will never be completely settled; maybe the discussion is the point, not the settling of it.In any event, aside from the social impact of the issues that take place in this seriocomic picture, the most memorable thing of all is the obvious fondness with which Tracy & Hepburn regard one another.  The best acting doesn't feel like acting and, in spite of Tracy's offscreen religious situation that prevented him from divorcing his wife and marrying Kate, and in spite of the dicey morality thereof, it's a pleasure to see them together with a witty script and George Cukor's sure direction.

136671,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,0792835972,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","Originally released in 1949, ""Adam's Rib"" still remains in scintillating mint condition 63 years later.  In my humble opinion, it's the pinnacle of the Tracy-Hepburn cinema partnership just ahead of ""Pat and Mike"", ""Woman of the Year"", and ""State of the Union.""  And it just happens to be one of the all time best films of the battle of the sexes ever made.Adam and Amanda Bonner (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) are married lawyers practicing in Manhattan.  Adam as the Assistant District Attorney is prosecuting Doris Attinger (Judy Holliday) a housewife on trial for shooting her unfaithful husband Warren Attinger (Tom Ewell).  Doris followed him and found him en flagrante in the apartment of ""the other woman"" Beryl Caighn (Jean Hagen).  Amanda is a fervent advocate for women's rights and total equality of the sexes.  Since an unwritten law protects the man if he should shoot the lover of his wife, Amanda believes Doris should be given the same consideration before the law.  She gets herself appointed Doris's attorney, and the fireworks begin as Adam and she square off against each other in court.  Complicating matters further is their wickedly mischievous neighbor composer Kip Lurie (David Wayne) who flirts outrageously with Amanda, and takes gleeful delight in Adams's discomfiture and the courtroom antics.Tracy and Hepburn are unqualifiedly marvelous, two champions at their peak.  Given a superb screenplay by the husband-wife team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon plus expect guidance from director George Cukor, they run with it delivering the most dazzling performance of their illustrious partnership.  In this tale based on men and women having the same equal rights before the law, it's one of the few times that Tracy and Hepburn are actually equals on the screen.  One usually is a notch above the other in responsibility, education, social position or employment, here both are successful, well educated lawyers, balancing each other perfectly on the scale.  Also there is a strong element of a satisfactory sexual relationship, even though since it's the era of Production Code Hollywood, there are the ubiquitous twin beds!  The astute viewer can pick it up in the little flashes and instances of a cozy intimacy between them; the hot blood is definitely coursing, (as it was in real life)!  Hepburn is especially alluring and desirable as a slightly ""mature"" woman, sveltely elegant, charmingly self-assured, moving with an instinctive grace and possessing that glorious face which improves with age, what a woman!  One of the most natural of actors, Tracy as always delivers the goods and then some, and as always makes it look deceptively effortless.  He can throw away a line such as looking at Hepburn trying a new flower trimmed hat and quip ""you look kind of like Grandma Moses"" without losing any of the intended humor.  Sufficient to say they are a joy together, absolutely believable as a couple who have been married a number of years and know each others little quirks and habits and aren't we moviegoers lucky to witness their alchemy!You'll not find such a sterling supporting ensemble in films nowadays, beginning with the incomparable Judy Holliday as Doris Attinger.  This was her first major film role, and actually with the collusion of Kanin, Gordon, Tracy, Hepburn and Cukor intended to be an elaborate screen test to win her the film role of Billie Dawn in Kanin's ""Born Yesterday"" which she'd originated on Broadway.  Here she is both comic and affecting, playing with an innate sweetness and a touch of pathos the drab put upon wife, who under Amanda's expert tutelage becomes more attractive and confident.  Hepburn and she really click in their scenes together particularly in the first long scene where Hepburn subdues her own strong personality to let Holliday's star quality shine through.  Incidentally the ploy to get Holliday  ""Born Yesterday"", worked, she not only won the role but a Best Actress Oscar as well.As her self-righteous dolt of a husband Warren Attinger, Tom Ewell plays his part so well you're almost sorry Doris didn't finish him off!  Jean Hagen, pretty in a coarse and flashy manner, with an on target urban accent, is just right as the floozy Beryl Caighn.  Fresh from two Broadway triumphs in ""Finian's Rainbow"" and ""Mister Roberts"", David Wayne with his crew cut, impish smirk and mocking demeanor cuts a fine figure of fun as composer Kip Lurie.  Two funny bits, one of them truly a showstopper or trial stopper anyway, are supplied by character actress Hope Emerson.The genesis of the screenplay resulted from a true story that Ruth Gordon told her husband Garson Kanin one sleety evening in 1947 when they were driving to their country home in Connecticut.  It concerned a well-known married theatrical couple Raymond Massey and his wife Adrienne Allen, and close friends of theirs another married couple Bill and Dorothy Whitney who were both exceptional lawyers.  The Masseys were having marital problems and Raymond confidentially consulted Dorothy for legal advice regarding separation and divorce, while concurrently Adrienne was privately conferring with Bill on the same thing.  The punch line was that when all was settled Raymond was married to Dorothy, and Adrienne married Bill, and both marriages happily endured until the deaths of the husbands.  This sparked the idea of married lawyers who are on opposite sides of a court case, from the beginning the Kanins intended it for Tracy and Hepburn, close personal friends, and custom tailored the script to them both.The Kanins wrote several successful screenplays, ""Pat and Mike"", ""The Marrying Kind"" and ""It Should Happen to You"", but this is their masterpiece.  It's an absolute pleasure to hear such a literate, well-constructed screenplay with dialogue that snaps and crackles with wit.  Witness this exchange between Amanda and Beryl on the witness stand when Amanda asks her if Mr. Attinger had ever touched her before:  (Beryl) ""We used to shake hands quite a lot""  (Amanda) ""Did you enjoy it?""  Or this gem from Kip to a tearful Amanda ""Lawyers should never marry other lawyers.

136672,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0792835972,Dennis Littrell,"[8, 11]","Two New York lawyers, husband Adam Bonner (Spencer Tracy) and wife Amanda Bonner (Katharine Hepburn), work out the marital tension and fight the sexual wars in the courtroom on opposite sides of a wife (Judy Holliday)  shoots cheating husband (Tom Ewell) case.  Adam's masculinity is seemingly  challenged and his sense of justice offended by his wife's insistence on  showing how smart she is while furthering her feminist agenda at the  expense of the law.  Will their public confrontation destroy their  marriage, or will it ultimately make the bond stronger?This still  plays mainly because of the charisma of Hepburn and Tracy and the fine  chemistry they create together.  The script by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon  is profound and shallow by turns, yet ultimately witty and pleasing.  Judy  Holliday as the lower middle-class Doris Attinger (on her way to her  signature role in Born Yesterday (1950)) and David Wayne, as the  song-writing neighbor who adores Amanda, shine in supporting roles.  George  Cukor's direction is clear, crisp and always focused.  In the end we can  see that Adam can be as feminine as Amanda can be masculine.  The bit where  Tracy cries real tears to win her back and then tells her, ""We all have our  tricks"" is classic.  It's his clever answer to her outrageous courtroom  theatrics.  Memorable as it illuminates their contrasting personalities is  the early scene where the unsophisticated Doris is interviewed by Yale law  school grad Amanda.As a political movie, was Adam's Rib ahead of its  time as a vehicle for feminist expression, or was it just another apology  for male chauvinism, or was it balanced and fair?  I'll give you a hint:  the title is ironic. One of the things that made the Tracy/Hepburn romance  work so well for so long was the creative balance they maintained in the  battle of the sexes.

Pawl ""Dani""","[3, 3]","ADAM'S RIB is a great example of intelligent, beautiful and thought-provoking cinema, with two of the most gifted individuals to ever grace the screen, Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.  Amanda (Hepburn) and Adam (Tracey) Bonner are married lawyers who are on opposite sides of a case, involving a woman (Judy Holiday in her film debut) who shot her abusive husband (Tom Ewell).  While Amanda and Adam stand on opposite sides in the courtroom, their genuine love and respect for each other balances the sparks that fly in their professional lives.I believe that this is one of the most progressive films made at its time.  It took on hard hitting issues like domestic violence, gender equality (or the lack thereof) in society and on the job.  Katherine Hepburn's character challenges every stereotype of the commonplace depiction of the ""model"" 1950s woman.  She has a career, brilliant and anything but a pushover.

The zingy repartee and old-shoe comfort in their relationship are in full bloom in this 1949 comedy classic directed by George Cukor. Written by the legendary husband and wife writing team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, the plot focuses on a headline-grabbing court case involving Doris Attinger, a dim-witted wife who shoots her philandering husband Warren just as he is caught with his blowsy mistress Beryl Caighn. Representing the wounded husband is Assistant DA Adam Bonner who is looking for a quick conviction of the wife. However, his proto-feminist attorney wife Amanda sees the alleged crime as an act of justifiable defiance and decides to defend the wife.This potentially tense set-up leads to a trial where Amanda sets out to prove that a double standard exists for women and that Doris was merely defending her family and home. Adam, however, believes that the law is the law no matter the gender of those involved and that a murder was indeed attempted. Consequently, the story is not so much about Adam's inherent sexism as it is about Amanda's single-minded determination to prove her point even as the case degrades into a media sideshow. Over half a century later, Amanda's arguments sound rather dated, one-note and frankly ill-conceived with many of her lines simply polemics. At the same time, Hepburn plays such a convincing litigator that her case actually sounds persuasive at times. Tracy is also in top form as he brings his unique combination of sympathy and combustible bluster to a man who respects his wife deeply but becomes increasingly disillusioned with her unlawful stance.Together, they banter terrifically throughout, but it's in the domestic scenes, for instance, the home movie of their Connecticut farm and the late night meal preparation, where you feel their natural chemistry the most. As Doris, Judy Holliday delivers in her first significant screen role, bringing a deeper pathos to the scorned wife than you would expect. Several years away from ""The Seven Year Itch"", Tom Ewell plays Warren for the smarmy, sexist cheater that he is, while Jean Hagen expertly plays Beryl as a media-hungry floozy. As the Bonners' next door neighbor Kip, David Wayne acts rather fey for someone who supposedly wants to run away with Amanda, but I suppose the approach was intentional to ensure nothing would really threaten the Bonner marriage except the case. However dated some of the sexual politics feel, the film is still one of the most smartly played of romantic comedies.

136677,A2TV6SBCWT7P8S,0792835972,ehakus,"[6, 8]","Probably the best of the Tracy-Hepburn movies, Adam's Rib is very funny and enjoyable. Excellently written, well directed by George Cukor, and (most of all) featuring great chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, this is the ultimate ""battle of the sexes"" movie and a must-see.Basically, Adam's Rib starts out with a wife who shoots at her husband (Judy Holliday, who does an excellent job with her important, if small, role) after finding him with another woman. At the trial, Holliday is represented by Amanda Bonner (Katherine Hepburn) who just happens to be opposed by her own husband (Spencer Tracy) who is the prosecuting attorney. The movie creatively uses the premise of the trial as a springboard for witty, funny conversations between the Bonners' about equality and the double standard (if Holliday had been a man, would she be judged so harshly).Anyhow, Adam's Rib is a fantastic film which discusses many relevant issues and is, contrary to what you might think, really quite modern in its outlook. There may be some points in the film that reflect its age but, overall, the main issue - the ever ongoing battle of the sexes - is still as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.Furthermore, the movie is so witty and well done that it would be a joy to watch even if the content was clearly irrelevant now. It features several scenes that are especially noteworthy - for instance, the scene in which Hepburn humiliates Tracy in court and the resulting scene where Tracy scares Hepburn with the licorice gun.

Women had exploded the myth of not being as capable as men and now they began demanding not just the vote, but equality in all things.  Made in 1949, ""Adam's Rib"" is a comedy that addressed one of the most hotly contested issues of the day.This is the fifth in a series of ten collaborations between Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.  This film was written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, a team that wrote two of the ten Hepburn/Tracy films (""Pat and Mike"" was the other).  Gordon and Kanin generally wrote stories that were patterned after their own marriage, and were nominated for an Oscar for this screenplay.  Katharine Hepburn always sought out roles that had a strong female character and Tracy enjoyed playing the traditional male trying to tame the tiger.  They were perfect for one another.  Their films were very popular because they were able to bring humor to a painful transition that was occurring all across America, the re-evaluation of women's roles in society.This story seems silly by today's standards, showing how far we've come.  A woman shoots her husband for cheating on her, and Amanda (Katharine Hepburn) decides to represent her as her defense counsel.  Her husband Adam (Spencer Tracy) is the prosecutor in the case.  Sparks fly between attorneys in the courtroom and the bedroom as the battle of the sexes ensues.  Much of it is in jest, but the film does a good job of making fun of the battle without mocking the women's cause.  The film whimsically makes the point that the issues are not black and white, and that the ideal of totally equality is impeded by numerous immutable differences between men and women.One of the most anachronistic elements has nothing to do with sex.  The idea that shooting one's spouse for infidelity is justifiable, whether man or woman, would be ludicrous in today's society.  In 1949, however, it was the generally held belief that home wreckers who were shot had gotten what was coming to them.  Amanda succeeds at arguing that this standard of justifiable assault should apply to women as well as men, but today a jury would laugh its way all the way to a guilty verdict regardless of the sex of the defendant.As always, Tracy and Hepburn are terrific together, with probably the best screen chemistry of any male/female team in the history of films.  Adam is always ribbing Amanda about her feminism (giving the title a double entendre) and defeats her in the end using one of her own female tricks.  Cole Porter contributes an original song ""Farewell Amanda"" which is a beautiful tune rendered trite by incessant repetition.  David Wayne is the only discordant note, elevating an annoying character to unbearably obnoxious with his snide delivery.This excellent comedy was relevant in its time, but it hasn't aged well because the times have changed (which may be all the more reason to see it).  I rated it a 9/10.

The trial gets a lot of attention as Hepburn attempts to assert the need for equality in how women and men are treated when caught in similar situations, such as revenge against a cheating spouse.  She believes a man shooting his wife would be considered more justifiable.  The trial also gets a lot of attention since the lawyers are married.  Thus men and women are pitted against each other in yet another fight for equality.  Elements of the film have dated, mostly surrounding the trial itself and Hepburn's circus like attempts to make her point.  But what is not dated is the very real chemistry between the two stars, setting off sparks outside the courtroom.  Both were top actors, with screen personalities and styles that contrast each other perfectly.  Their talent and chemistry alone can carry a film.  They are well supported by the wonderful Judy Holliday, who makes her character just slightly off-centre enough to be believable.  The only sour note is David Wayne, as Hepburn's obsessed neighbour.  It's not that he doesn't do a good job - he does.  But the character is extremely annoying as written, and I found myself fast-forwarding through some of his parts.

We get an idea of her motive when she drops her purse and a small revolver spills out. Her hunch is right, and after reading the directions how to use the weapon, she closes her eyes and starts shooting, wounding but not killing, her husband. The story shifts to a stylish apartment building where a servant is bringing breakfast to the bedroom of Adam (Tracy) and Amanda (Hepburn) Bonner. They scan the lead stories as they eat and prepare for work, noting the attempted murder story. Adam arrives at his office (Assistant District Attorney) and discovers he has been assigned to the case which he assumes will be a 'slam dunk'. He calls to tell Amanda, an attorney in private practice, the news and rub it in how he will put this one away quickly. Amanda hangs up on him, determined to defend this woman, believing women are treated differently than men and that this woman was justified in her actions. The movie shifts to the courtroom where the action and the fun begins. Each night the trial carries over into their personal life. A little dated now, it was somewhat shocking in 1949 that a woman could, heaven forbid, compete in the 'men's domain'. Where are there inequities today that need to be corrected?

If you want to find razor-sharp, fast-moving dialog, try the Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster film, ""The Sweet Smell of Success."" The hard-hitting, corrosive, and rapid-fire dialog in that movie virtually singes the air, remembered long after the movie has ended, although it's a much more serious movie and not intended to be funny as with this one.But getting back to the present flick, if there was a longer or more charismatic on-screen romance than Tracy and Hepburn, I don't know what it is, and they bring that chemistry once again to the silver screen in this movie. Their rivalry in the murder case becomes the talk of the town as well as in their bedroom, and Tracy is great as the dutiful husband who suffers Hepburns' barbs and diatribes about everything from his job to women's rights with a sort of calm, stoic exasperatedness, although she finally gets his goat and gets a rise out of him on more than one occasion. And Hepburn is equally great in her role also, as the smart, upbeat, and driven defense attorney who champions the accused woman's cause.The movie deals surprisingly well with many women's rights and equality issues considering this is 1949, and women who think feminism and women's lib was invented in the early to mid-60's would do well to watch this film, which came out almost 15 years earlier.

What I can say with full knowledge is that Katherine Hepburn was perfect for this role, playing the same sort of independent woman she herself tended to be from time to time.This is a richly written movie about a married couple, Adam and Amanda, who are both lawyers and who are both working on the same case... opposing each other.  A woman shot at her uncaring, unsympathetic husband.  Adam claims that it's necessary to bring her to the attention of the law.  Amanda claims that she won't be given fair treatment as a woman.  A battle of the sexes ensues.The best part of this movie is showing this rather adoring and loving couple as they go through the day to day stresses of their jobs and yet try to maintain a home life at the same time.  However, that's just the first element, as of course the stresses of facing each other has to be taken into account.  Indeed it's hard to say quite for sure where the movie's going to go, but once it's ended it seems like it couldn't have been presented in any other way.George Cukor does a brillaint job with directing it.  I particularly like how he often sets the camera in a room and lets the characters weave in and out of the area in a way that evenly presents both the disconnect and the miscommunication of the couple from both perspectives.  This movie is brilliant in that it is capable of maintaining two (or more) points of view entirely at the same time.All in all, a very good movie, one of those that makes one nostalgic for the warmth and compassion often felt in older movies.

136709,A16QODENBJVUI1,0792835972,Robert Moore,"[10, 10]","Of all the films that Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy made together, this is my favorite.  The two are absolutely brilliant as a husband and wife who are both lawyers on opposite sides of a case having to do with a woman defending her honor by shooting her husband when she finds him cheating on her.  As great as the two leads are, however, this film is so rich and succeeds on so many levels that it would have been a great success even with two far less gifted performers.  The film also features what was essentially the debut of three well known performers:  Jean Hagen (who would shine only three years later in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN), Tom Ewell, and the absolutely magnificent Judy Holiday, arguably the greatest dumb blondes in the history of Hollywood (despite being by all accounts one of the most intellectually brilliant performers ever, once having scored over 170 on an IQ test).  Holiday is especially great in the film, absolutely stealing every scene in which she appears.  Her scene in the witness chair is my favorite scene in the film.  David Wayne fills out a remarkable cast as Hepburn and Tracy's next door neighbor, a songwriter who pens the song &quot;Farewell, Amanda&quot; for Hepburn, who plays Amanda Bonner (Tracy is Adam Bonner, hence the title of the film).  His constant bantering enlivens nearly every scene in which he appears.George Cukor does his usual competent job directing, but the heart of the film, in addition to the acting, is the outstanding script by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin.  The movie is stuffed with jokes, gags, emotional tension, and serious issues in a manner that is rarely successful.  One of my few complaints with the film is the rather absurd handling of questions of women's equality, naively basing it on the ability of a woman to do anything a man can do, which is, of course, absurd in a variety of situations.  For instance, they bring a Strong Woman into the court room, to demonstrate that a woman can be as strong as a man, though it is impossible to discern what legal point that is supposed to make, and leads to a moment of slapstick that is below the quality of the rest of the film.  The silliness of this scene seems to undercut the seriousness of the issue of women's issues in the rest of the film.  Also, one can see the wires used to make it appear the woman is lifting him over her head, making it seem even sillier.This is one of those movies that improves upon reviewing, partly because a first viewing isn't sufficient to unveil all the excellences contained within it.  It remains one of my favorite films by all of the principles involved.",5,"A classic that succeeds on many, many levels",1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,2628,"['films', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'made', 'together', 'favorite', 'two', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'husband', 'wife', 'who', 'are', 'lawyers', 'opposite', 'sides', 'case', 'having', 'do', 'woman', 'defending', 'honor', 'shooting', 'husband', 'when', 'cheating', 'As', 'great', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'however', 'film', 'so', 'rich', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'success', 'even', 'two', 'far', 'less', 'gifted', 'performers', 'film', 'also', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'debut', 'three', 'well', 'known', 'performers', 'Jean', 'Hagen', 'who', 'would', 'shine', 'only', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'SINGIN', 'IN', 'THE', 'RAIN', 'Tom', 'Ewell', 'absolutely', 'magnificent', 'Judy', 'Holiday', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'dumb', 'blondes', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'being', 'accounts', 'one', 'most', 'intellectually', 'brilliant', 'performers', 'ever', 'once', 'having', 'scored', '170', 'IQ', 'test', 'Holiday', 'especially', 'great', 'film', 'absolutely', 'stealing', 'scene', 'scene', 'witness', 'chair', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'David', 'Wayne', 'out', 'remarkable', 'cast', 'Hepburn', 'Tracy', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'songwriter', 'who', 'song', 'quot', 'Farewell', 'Amanda', 'quot', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'Amanda', 'Bonner', 'Tracy', 'Adam', 'Bonner', 'hence', 'title', 'film', 'constant', 'bantering', 'enlivens', 'nearly', 'scene', 'Cukor', 'usual', 'competent', 'job', 'directing', 'heart', 'film', 'addition', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'script', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'Garson', 'Kanin', 'movie', 'stuffed', 'jokes', 'gags', 'emotional', 'tension', 'serious', 'issues', 'manner', 'rarely', 'successful', 'One', 'few', 'complaints', 'film', 'rather', 'absurd', 'handling', 'questions', 'women', 'equality', 'naively', 'basing', 'ability', 'woman', 'do', 'anything', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'course', 'variety', 'situations', 'instance', 'bring', 'Strong', 'Woman', 'court', 'room', 'demonstrate', 'woman', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'strong', 'man', 'impossible', 'discern', 'what', 'legal', 'point', 'supposed', 'make', 'moment', 'slapstick', 'quality', 'rest', 'film', 'silliness', 'scene', 'undercut', 'seriousness', 'issue', 'women', 'issues', 'rest', 'film', 'Also', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'wires', 'used', 'make', 'appear', 'woman', 'lifting', 'head', 'making', 'seem', 'even', 'sillier.This', 'one', 'movies', 'reviewing', 'partly', 'first', 'viewing', ""n't"", 'sufficient', 'unveil', 'excellences', 'contained', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'principles', 'involved']",N/A

Possibly the idea that I had the most trouble with was that at the time men who shot their cheating wives would often be let off, while women who did the same thing often got nailed. It never really explains this, and I had to get it from the back of the box. Of course, if this film took place today Amanda would be laughed out of the courtroom long before her closing statement, which really drove home how much things have changed. It really should be viewed for anyone who wants to know about the 40s, and anyone who is just looking for a good time.",5,a charming and hilarious time capsule,993686400,"06 28, 2001",2001,651,"['did', ""n't"", 'live', 'period', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'found', 'hard', 'understand', 'first', 'Possibly', 'idea', 'had', 'most', 'trouble', 'was', 'time', 'men', 'who', 'shot', 'cheating', 'wives', 'would', 'often', 'be', 'let', 'off', 'women', 'who', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'often', 'got', 'nailed', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'get', 'back', 'box', 'course', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'today', 'Amanda', 'would', 'be', 'laughed', 'courtroom', 'long', 'closing', 'statement', 'really', 'drove', 'home', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'who', 'know', '40s', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'looking', 'good', 'time']",N/A

I had high hopes for  this film since I like Judy Holliday and Jean Hagen, however i cannot begin  to describe to you how ludicrous this film is.  If you have not seen this  film save yourself see any other Katharine Hepburn film, or read a book,  just don't watch this film.  The plot is boring and contrived, and although  this film is trying to make a statement about equal rights for women I  think it fails.
