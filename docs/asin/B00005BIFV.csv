581251,A3I3051BZDJWGU,B00005BIFV,Diane C. Howard,"[2, 4]","My review doesn't match my stars!Please, someone, recommend a GOOD Monkey King DVD that I can watch in the USA!From an American point of view, I enjoyed the fact that it was Monkey. I've read two translations, but until this, had never seen Monkey on-screen (for another western taste, get Forbidden Kingdom). I loved this, except for the stupid love story. There is no place for that in Monkey, and I found it offensive. If you are from Asia, you may be offended at what America has done to a venerable tale and to the Goddess of Compassion. I don't blame you. I keep rewriting this in my head. Hollywood screws up everything. At least, thank God, Disney hasn't got a hold of it.  Well, getting on with it:Read the one-star reviews first, then go up the scale. Since other reviews will tell you what you need to know, I'll say this: If you are a westerner who is unfamiliar with Monkey's Journey to the West (one of the world's most popular tales, even if we don't know it), this is a fair introduction, even if it is inaccurate and offensive. I know, offensive is a bad word. Think of the old Westerns, where the indians were all white actors, or minstrel shows, where the actors were all in blackface. It's that kind of offensive. But like those old westerns, you can still enjoy this film for what it is.It was fun watching the terra cotta army, the Chinese version of heaven (so filled with beaurocrats and civil servants), and Monkey and crew. I found it a lot of fun, except for the offensive romantic relationship. I can take bastardizing a tale as long as Journey to the West. I can even allow a western scholar to bridge a cultural gap, even if Another White Man to the Rescue bores and angers me. I was disgusted at the turning the Goddess of Compassion into an airbrained, ditsy sex toy (albeit a chaste one).Still, probably because I am a westerner, I enjoyed this for what it is. Funny, because I can't enjoy Disney's destruction of Little Mermaid or the Pocahontas rape/kidnapping.Anyhow, I enjoyed it and watch it regularly, which is why I gave it five stars. Enjoying it does not take away any of the negatives, but the negatives do not take away from the pure fun of this.",5,"Fun, but near racist",1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,2190,"['review', ""n't"", 'match', 'stars', 'Please', 'someone', 'recommend', 'GOOD', 'Monkey', 'King', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'USA', 'American', 'point', 'view', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'was', 'Monkey', ""'ve"", 'read', 'two', 'translations', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Monkey', 'on-screen', 'western', 'taste', 'get', 'Forbidden', 'Kingdom', 'loved', 'stupid', 'love', 'story', 'place', 'Monkey', 'found', 'offensive', 'are', 'Asia', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'what', 'America', 'done', 'venerable', 'tale', 'Goddess', 'Compassion', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'keep', 'rewriting', 'head', 'Hollywood', 'up', 'everything', 'least', 'thank', 'God', 'Disney', ""n't"", 'got', 'hold', 'Well', 'getting', 'Read', 'one-star', 'reviews', 'first', 'then', 'go', 'up', 'scale', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'need', 'know', ""'ll"", 'say', 'are', 'westerner', 'who', 'unfamiliar', 'Monkey', 'Journey', 'West', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'popular', 'tales', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fair', 'introduction', 'even', 'inaccurate', 'offensive', 'know', 'offensive', 'bad', 'word', 'Think', 'old', 'Westerns', 'where', 'indians', 'were', 'white', 'actors', 'minstrel', 'shows', 'where', 'actors', 'were', 'blackface', 'kind', 'offensive', 'old', 'westerns', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'film', 'what', 'is.It', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'terra', 'cotta', 'army', 'Chinese', 'version', 'heaven', 'so', 'filled', 'beaurocrats', 'civil', 'servants', 'Monkey', 'crew', 'found', 'lot', 'fun', 'offensive', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'can', 'take', 'bastardizing', 'tale', 'as', 'long', 'Journey', 'West', 'can', 'even', 'allow', 'western', 'scholar', 'bridge', 'cultural', 'gap', 'even', 'White', 'Man', 'Rescue', 'bores', 'angers', 'was', 'disgusted', 'turning', 'Goddess', 'Compassion', 'airbrained', 'ditsy', 'sex', 'toy', 'chaste', 'one', '.Still', 'probably', 'am', 'westerner', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'Funny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Disney', 'destruction', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Pocahontas', 'rape/kidnapping.Anyhow', 'enjoyed', 'watch', 'regularly', 'why', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'Enjoying', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'negatives', 'negatives', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'pure', 'fun']",The Lost Empire

No.But it was still fun to watch and a lot more kid oriented then the Chinese Ghost story movies or many of the Chinese fantasy movies made. Not to mention it is in English so you don't have to read subtitles or hear a bad dub.I think the biggest downer of this movie was the main protagonist (played by Thomas Gibson) just isn't a good actor. The rest of the cast was just fine. Does Russell Wong ever age?This movie not up to par with the direction or story telling as the Hallmark verion of Gulliver's Travels or The Odyssey, which in my opinion are more serious stories made for adults anyway.My kids thought Piggsy (the pig-man) kicking martial arts (...) with a rake was hilarious.

581260,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00005BIFV,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[24, 26]","The Lost Empire / The Monkey King is a mini series that tells the story of Nicholas Orton (Thomas Gibson) who finds himself on a save-the-world mission. The plot itself is a bit difficult to follow - it is loosely inspired by 'Journey to the West'- the famous chinese epic. However in this version, it shows us what would happen if 'Journey to the West' had never existed. Demons are trying to destroy the book (for the simple reason of that's what evil demons do with their spare time) and the world is running backwards because of it, deleting all the things that 'Journey to the West' helped inspire (which includes buildings and clocks, strangely enough). So the Goddess of Mercy, Kwan Ying (Ling Bai) travels from her world to find the prophesied Scholar from Above - our own Nick Orton. He is 'above' because all of the mythological characters he later mets live in a copy of China in one of the (very, very, very large) unexcavated tombs, under the musuem. So with the help of Kwan Ying and the famous terracotta warriors that come to life, Nick finds himself inside the tomb/copy of mythological China, faced with the sacastic Monkey King (Russell Wong) who was been trapped inside a mountain by those same demons that are out to destroy 'Journey to the West'.As you can see, the premise is quite confusing, so if you like to sit down and get a nice, logical plot, you might want to give this one a miss, as our heroes do a lot of wandering around and your not actually sure where they're going or why.However, if you are a fan of other Hallmark fantasy mini-series (the Magical Legend of the Leprechauns, Merlin, Arabian Nights, the 10th Kingdom, the Voyage of the Unicorn) then this is the movie for you. Like the others it boasts great special effects, great set-designs and Kwan Ying and her consort Whitesnake wear the most beautiful outfits I've seen. The lovely Ling Bai is perfectly cast as the Goddess of Mercy, and the scenes that take place in the home of the gods are wonderful. Nick and his reluctant teacher the Monkey King are good too, and get some good one-liners, and their allies Pigsy and Friar Sand should appeal to kids. The romance between Nick and Kwan Ying is nothing new, but still enjoyable to watch, and the carefully choreographed martial-art sequences are amazing.If you are a Chinese-historian or a purist of any kind, I advise you to steer clear, as I'm sure Confucius wasn't an annoying, back-stabbing traiter as he is portrayed here, but everyone else should just sit down and enjoy the ride without being picky.",3,The Goddess of Mercy,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,2554,"['Lost', 'Empire', 'Monkey', 'King', 'mini', 'series', 'story', 'Nicholas', 'Orton', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'who', 'save-the-world', 'mission', 'plot', 'bit', 'difficult', 'follow', 'loosely', 'inspired', ""'Journey"", ""West'-"", 'famous', 'chinese', 'epic', 'However', 'version', 'would', 'happen', ""'Journey"", 'West', 'had', 'never', 'existed', 'Demons', 'are', 'trying', 'destroy', 'book', 'simple', 'reason', 'what', 'evil', 'demons', 'do', 'spare', 'time', 'world', 'running', 'backwards', 'deleting', 'things', ""'Journey"", 'West', 'helped', 'inspire', 'buildings', 'clocks', 'strangely', 'enough', 'Goddess', 'Mercy', 'Kwan', 'Ying', 'Ling', 'Bai', 'travels', 'world', 'find', 'prophesied', 'Scholar', 'Above', 'own', 'Nick', 'Orton', 'mythological', 'characters', 'later', 'live', 'copy', 'China', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'large', 'unexcavated', 'tombs', 'musuem', 'So', 'help', 'Kwan', 'Ying', 'famous', 'terracotta', 'warriors', 'come', 'life', 'Nick', 'tomb/copy', 'mythological', 'China', 'faced', 'sacastic', 'Monkey', 'King', 'Russell', 'Wong', 'who', 'was', 'been', 'trapped', 'mountain', 'same', 'demons', 'are', 'destroy', ""'Journey"", ""West'.As"", 'can', 'see', 'premise', 'quite', 'confusing', 'so', 'like', 'sit', 'down', 'get', 'nice', 'logical', 'plot', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'miss', 'heroes', 'do', 'lot', 'wandering', 'around', 'not', 'actually', 'sure', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'why.However', 'are', 'fan', 'other', 'Hallmark', 'fantasy', 'mini-series', 'Magical', 'Legend', 'Leprechauns', 'Merlin', 'Arabian', 'Nights', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'Voyage', 'Unicorn', 'then', 'movie', 'others', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'set-designs', 'Kwan', 'Ying', 'consort', 'Whitesnake', 'wear', 'most', 'beautiful', 'outfits', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lovely', 'Ling', 'Bai', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Goddess', 'Mercy', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'home', 'gods', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Nick', 'reluctant', 'teacher', 'Monkey', 'King', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'get', 'good', 'one-liners', 'allies', 'Pigsy', 'Friar', 'Sand', 'should', 'appeal', 'kids', 'romance', 'Nick', 'Kwan', 'Ying', 'nothing', 'new', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'carefully', 'choreographed', 'martial-art', 'sequences', 'are', 'are', 'Chinese-historian', 'purist', 'kind', 'advise', 'steer', 'clear', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Confucius', 'was', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'back-stabbing', 'traiter', 'portrayed', 'here', 'everyone', 'else', 'should', 'just', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'being', 'picky']",The Lost Empire

I read all the reviews and decided to give it a chance-save yourself the dissapointment. The movie could have been so good. The plot is quite good but the screenplay, acting, effects, are not. A goddess having a drink at the bar...come on, even I won't watch something that lame. Mythology is something I love but the way these people portray it becomes laughable, and disrespects the story it's trying to tell. Most of all you can't even like the hero because he is so annoying! Buy the Snow Queen, Jack and the Beanstalk, DEFINETLY 10th Kingdom, but don't buy this movie!(no, don't even think about giving it a chance because it has a cool cover)",1,DO NOT waste your time...,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,967,"['movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'yet', 'watched', 'just', 'see', 'possibly', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'can', 'act', 'damn', 'monkey', 'even', 'then', 'character', 'development', 'slim', 'always', 'buy', 'Halmark', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'etc', 'one', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'endorsed', 'read', 'reviews', 'decided', 'give', 'chance-save', 'dissapointment', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'good', 'plot', 'quite', 'good', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'A', 'goddess', 'having', 'drink', 'bar', 'come', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'something', 'lame', 'Mythology', 'something', 'love', 'way', 'people', 'portray', 'laughable', 'story', 'trying', 'tell', 'Most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'hero', 'so', 'annoying', 'Buy', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'DEFINETLY', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'giving', 'chance', 'cool', 'cover']",The Lost Empire

The major characters are Kuan Yin, Confucius, and a flock of other gods, godlings, immortals, buddhas, figures from myth, and other well-known figures and stereotypes from the Chinese pantheon. There are the flying heroes, improbable weapons, and acting at least on a par with the Dr. Who series. In other words, lots of viewers will see it as alien, disconnected, and amateurish, as well as being filled overly convenient miracles.But it's not in the Western idiom, so parts of it have to be taken in their own terms. And it has the look of a low-budget film, so you won't see effects on the Star Wars scale. And it is a bit cheesy and over-the-top, which is part of the appeal.The fights are bloodless, the romance is chaste, and all but the youngest kids will understand the characters. If you don't take it or yourself too seriously, there's a lot of fun in this one.//wiredweird",4,Passable entertainment,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,1007,"['OK', 'rounded', 'up', '4', 'stars', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'idiom', 'most', 'American', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'familiar', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'Kuan', 'Yin', 'Confucius', 'flock', 'other', 'gods', 'godlings', 'immortals', 'buddhas', 'figures', 'myth', 'other', 'well-known', 'figures', 'stereotypes', 'Chinese', 'pantheon', 'are', 'flying', 'heroes', 'improbable', 'weapons', 'acting', 'least', 'par', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'series', 'other', 'words', 'lots', 'viewers', 'will', 'see', 'alien', 'disconnected', 'amateurish', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'filled', 'overly', 'convenient', 'miracles.But', 'not', 'Western', 'idiom', 'parts', 'have', 'be', 'taken', 'own', 'terms', 'look', 'low-budget', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'effects', 'Star', 'Wars', 'scale', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'over-the-top', 'part', 'appeal.The', 'fights', 'are', 'bloodless', 'romance', 'chaste', 'youngest', 'kids', 'will', 'understand', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'lot', 'fun', 'one.//wiredweird']",The Lost Empire
