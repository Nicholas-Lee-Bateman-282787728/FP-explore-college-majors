1248850,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0021R52IU,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[53, 54]","NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online.I took a yoga workshop with Desir&eacute;e Rumbaugh, the instructor of this DVD, in September 2008, and it was absolutely amazing.  However, I also tried Rumbaugh's previously two DVD releases, Yoga to the Rescue and Yoga to the Rescue for Back Pain, and unfortunately found them to be be disappointing.  Happily, this latest release succeeds where the prior two videos failed.One important change which Rumbaugh made for this DVD is that there are two separate 30-minute practice segments:  the ""Tutorial"" offers more comprehensive instruction plus a detailed review of modifications for most of the postures, whereas the ""Flow Sequence"" is a faster-moving, more dynamic session based on the postures introduced during the tutorial.  For both segments, Rumbaugh has an assistant, Andrew Riven, who displays the modified versions of the poses.  Rumbaugh instructs the Tutorial segment via voiceover, although a few of the segments are preceded by brief live introductions.  The chapters of the Tutorial are listed below:*Wall Shoulder Stretch & Chair Pose*Neck Strengthening*Push-Ups*Sphinx & Cobra*Bow Pose*Down Dog*Locust Pose*Side-to-Side Leg Lifts*Crunches*Lunge with Twist*Side Plank*Shoulder Stand*Bridge, Plow & Shoulder Stand*RelaxationAs the title suggests, the Flow Sequence moves along at a significantly quicker pace.  Rumbaugh again teaches via voiceover, but there are no chapter breakdowns and no pauses between segments.  The entire practice continues in this vigorous manner before concluding with the short (approximately 4 minutes) relaxation.Although I am very pleased with this DVD, I would offer a few cautions.  The DVD case states ""For Beginners & Beyond,"" which I think is misleading.  I would recommend these practices for experienced yoga students only--i.e., advanced beginners and above.  The case description also suggests that the practices will help to ""alleviate pain and stiffness,"" and I do think the DVD would be valuable for this purpose--that is, in terms of normal, everyday aches and pains.  I would be much more hesitant to recommend this DVD to someone with any type of injury or other special condition which might require a more GENTLE therapeutic approach.",5,Rumbaugh finally gets it right!,1257465600,"11 6, 2009",2009,2290,"['NOTE', 'received', 'free', 'review', 'copy', 'DVD', 'web', 'site', 'Metapsychology', 'Online.I', 'took', 'yoga', 'workshop', 'Desir', 'eacute', 'Rumbaugh', 'instructor', 'DVD', 'September', '2008', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'However', 'also', 'tried', 'Rumbaugh', 'previously', 'two', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Yoga', 'Rescue', 'Yoga', 'Rescue', 'Back', 'Pain', 'unfortunately', 'found', 'be', 'be', 'disappointing', 'Happily', 'latest', 'release', 'where', 'prior', 'two', 'videos', 'failed.One', 'important', 'change', 'Rumbaugh', 'made', 'DVD', 'are', 'two', 'separate', '30-minute', 'practice', 'segments', 'Tutorial', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'instruction', 'detailed', 'review', 'modifications', 'most', 'postures', 'Flow', 'Sequence', 'faster-moving', 'more', 'dynamic', 'session', 'based', 'postures', 'introduced', 'tutorial', 'segments', 'Rumbaugh', 'assistant', 'Andrew', 'Riven', 'who', 'modified', 'versions', 'poses', 'Rumbaugh', 'Tutorial', 'segment', 'voiceover', 'few', 'segments', 'are', 'preceded', 'brief', 'live', 'introductions', 'chapters', 'Tutorial', 'are', 'listed', '*Wall', 'Shoulder', 'Stretch', 'Chair', 'Pose*Neck', 'Strengthening*Push-Ups*Sphinx', 'Cobra*Bow', 'Pose*Down', 'Dog*Locust', 'Pose*Side-to-Side', 'Leg', 'Lifts*Crunches*Lunge', 'Twist*Side', 'Plank*Shoulder', 'Stand*Bridge', 'Plow', 'Shoulder', 'Stand*RelaxationAs', 'title', 'Flow', 'Sequence', 'along', 'significantly', 'quicker', 'pace', 'Rumbaugh', 'again', 'voiceover', 'are', 'chapter', 'breakdowns', 'pauses', 'segments', 'entire', 'practice', 'vigorous', 'manner', 'concluding', 'short', 'approximately', '4', 'minutes', 'relaxation.Although', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'would', 'offer', 'few', 'cautions', 'DVD', 'case', 'Beginners', 'Beyond', 'think', 'misleading', 'would', 'recommend', 'practices', 'experienced', 'yoga', 'students', 'only', 'i.e.', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'above', 'case', 'description', 'also', 'practices', 'will', 'help', 'alleviate', 'pain', 'stiffness', 'do', 'think', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'valuable', 'purpose', 'terms', 'normal', 'everyday', 'aches', 'pains', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'hesitant', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'someone', 'type', 'injury', 'other', 'special', 'condition', 'might', 'require', 'more', 'GENTLE', 'therapeutic', 'approach']",YOGA TO THE RESCUE FOR NECK & SHOULDERS

She provides decently thorough instruction and also provides modifications of poses.On the negative, she moves quickly in and out of poses, which are not held long. She instructs very quickly. There's not a flow between poses,as a sequence, rather the video cuts from pose to pose. Somehow, her word choice doesn't quite nail it for me, an advanced beginner; afterwards, I found myself more stressed in other places in my body, than when I had begun the practice. I don't think its sufficiently safe for someone who had a bit of back pain or weakness going into it. Rather, I'd use this once truly intermediate or advanced for back strengthening and maintenance. Maybe I'll purchase it someday in the future....but I need some gentle, safe strengthening first.If you'd like a safe practice by knowledgeable instructor, with a male counterpart doing modifications, also in an indoor setting with chill music, check out 'Yoga Therapy for Back Pain' with Emily Klingermann.

1248853,A3DABNO1HS997Q,B0021R52IU,J. kingman,"[1, 1]","I could feel a difference after just one session of Desiree's DVD. I have had upper back stiffness, posture trouble, and serious neck and shoulder stiffness and restriction of movement for years now. I've gone to doctors, massage therapists, and chiropractors repeatedly with very little relief beyond a day. I wish it had crossed my mind sooner to try yoga postures that targeted my problem areas.I found just a couple of Desiree's poses a tad too advanced and difficult for me, so I'm just going slowly with those. The majority of these moves are straightforward and invigorating and I have no trouble doing them. She explains what to do very well in a clear and gentle voice. Although some of the ""open your heart"" and ""let the light shine from your head"" stuff is just a little too new-agey for me, you get the gist of what to do, and it is filmed clearly from different angles. Her companion does the same moves but often at a lower level for those of us who are less flexible. The studio is very nice, and the music is very pretty and relaxing.I'm really very pleased, as I've done her exercises only for a few days now and I feel better already. Sure, there is some residual soreness, but it is the good kind of sore that you get after a good workout when you challenge your body and work towards improvement. I predict that if I keep up with these poses, I'll feel better and better.",5,Very helpful poses for neck/shoulder tightness and restriction.,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,1391,"['could', 'feel', 'difference', 'just', 'one', 'session', 'Desiree', 'DVD', 'have', 'had', 'upper', 'back', 'stiffness', 'posture', 'trouble', 'serious', 'neck', 'shoulder', 'stiffness', 'restriction', 'movement', 'years', 'now', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'doctors', 'massage', 'therapists', 'chiropractors', 'repeatedly', 'very', 'little', 'relief', 'day', 'wish', 'had', 'crossed', 'mind', 'sooner', 'try', 'yoga', 'postures', 'targeted', 'problem', 'areas.I', 'found', 'just', 'couple', 'Desiree', 'tad', 'too', 'advanced', 'difficult', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'slowly', 'majority', 'moves', 'are', 'straightforward', 'invigorating', 'have', 'trouble', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'clear', 'gentle', 'voice', 'open', 'heart', 'let', 'light', 'shine', 'head', 'stuff', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'new-agey', 'get', 'gist', 'what', 'do', 'filmed', 'clearly', 'different', 'angles', 'companion', 'same', 'moves', 'often', 'lower', 'level', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'flexible', 'studio', 'very', 'nice', 'music', 'very', 'pretty', 'relaxing.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'very', 'pleased', ""'ve"", 'done', 'exercises', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'now', 'feel', 'better', 'already', 'Sure', 'residual', 'soreness', 'good', 'kind', 'sore', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'when', 'challenge', 'body', 'work', 'towards', 'improvement', 'predict', 'keep', 'up', 'poses', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'better', 'better']",YOGA TO THE RESCUE FOR NECK & SHOULDERS
