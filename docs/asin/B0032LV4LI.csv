""lets make him go after the 4 minute mile"" ... but the movie would have been much better if he was going after breaking a 5 minute mile ... people would have still thought that was fast, he looks like him might be able to run a 5 minute mile ... and runner's could respect that more.",4,Christian Running,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,968,"['coach', 'Christian', 'runner', 'appreciate', 'Christian', 'teaching', 'film', 'running', 'aspects', 'are', 'better', 'most', 'running', 'movies', 'say', 'not', 'terrible', 'always', 'amazing', 'college', 'runner', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'running', 'movies', 'there', 'never', 'think', 'talk', 'runner', 'filming', 'good', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'not', 'young', 'kids', 'one', 'missed', 'area', 'should', 'have', 'written', 'more', 'main', 'character', 'had', 'running', 'ability', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'enough', 'shape', 'end', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'happened', 'writer', 'just', 'did', 'shortcut', 'said', '..', 'lets', 'make', 'go', '4', 'minute', 'mile', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'going', 'breaking', '5', 'minute', 'mile', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'thought', 'was', 'fast', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'run', '5', 'minute', 'mile', 'runner', 'could', 'respect', 'more']",N/A

It's a very interesting twist on friendship, family and death. It has values and believe it or not a good twist on what happens when you feel guilty. It's a story about two high school friends. When they were little they both talked about track but as they grew one of the boys went into football.When an accident happens with the kid who stuck with track the kid who went to football decides to go back to running track. Now the irony of it is that his father is the football coach and wants his son to get the scholarship with football since college is so expensive.His son instead sticks with track and starts training to run the mile in under 4 minutes.This is a story of determination and seeing the goal you want and going for it regardless of what anyone else says or thinks.
