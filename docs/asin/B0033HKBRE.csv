The false note is the inane pseudo dating dialogue between Ian Somerhalder and Bijou Phillips where both actors seem too cool handed and smart to say silly dating things - that is very strange.  It's hard to trust Ian Somerhalder's character because his lines don't match his face despite the frat boy haircut.

Add the stereotypic plot tension of the usual family discords with: Should clumsy female trust good-looking guy? Of course the movie is set up to make him look suspicious but we all know it's a tension device. Besides our beyond-likable male love interest happens to be a doggy doctor who has just lost his fianc&eacute; to cancer (but as it turns out he does make her ending, painless) - such stereotypes alone are worth a few extra million in viewer share.(3.)

Rueger ""Julie""","[1, 1]","I have to admit - when Ian Somerhalder first came onto the scene with Lost (ok...that was the first that I'd heard of him)...I thought he was just a pretty face.  In fact, I pretty much didn't hop onto the bandwagon until I saw him play Damon Salvatore in ""The Vampire Diaries.""  So...now I want to see him in other things.  Enter this movie.The premise is awful..Bijou Phillips is both ""cute-as-a-button"" and ""eerie"" and ""annoying"" with her portrayal of an emotionally stunned woman who just happens to frequent funerals in an attempt to ""feel"" again.  I was willing to suspend belief UNTIL  the scene with the ring.  THEN...it became painful.  It was painful because of how Bojou's character treated Ian's character (Tyler) throughout the entire movie.  The woman is flawed.  VERY flawed.  You get the sense that there is something Tyler is holding back...that there is more to the death of his fiancee...and as part of the audience i don't think ANY of us believed he was a killer.  To watch Karis go off the deep end.  Wow.Ian's performance was the typical nice guy.  He did a great job of making you believe that the comedy of errors would wind up exonerating him.  But it was STILL painful to watch...not because his performance was bad or that the movie was bad...but BECAUSE the way Karis stumbles around and fails to be honest and BELIEVES a man she's said she's in love with to be a murderer so easily...well..The movie ends with a single scene.  I wanted at least something said between these characters.  It was a tender moment - bittersweet...but at the same time leaves the audience hanging. Ok...it left me hanging.  That being said, I did LIKE it.  I know...a bit contradictory...but ultimately it has heart.",4,Enjoyed the movie...BUT,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,1724,"['have', 'admit', 'when', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'first', 'came', 'scene', 'Lost', 'ok', 'was', 'first', ""'d"", 'heard', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'hop', 'bandwagon', 'saw', 'play', 'Damon', 'Salvatore', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'now', 'want', 'see', 'other', 'things', 'Enter', 'movie.The', 'premise', 'awful..Bijou', 'Phillips', 'cute-as-a-button', 'eerie', 'annoying', 'portrayal', 'emotionally', 'stunned', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'frequent', 'funerals', 'attempt', 'feel', 'again', 'was', 'willing', 'suspend', 'belief', 'UNTIL', 'scene', 'ring', 'THEN', 'became', 'painful', 'was', 'painful', 'how', 'Bojou', 'character', 'treated', 'Ian', 'character', 'Tyler', 'entire', 'movie', 'woman', 'flawed', 'VERY', 'flawed', 'get', 'sense', 'something', 'Tyler', 'holding', 'back', 'more', 'death', 'fiancee', 'part', 'audience', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ANY', 'believed', 'was', 'killer', 'watch', 'Karis', 'go', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'Wow.Ian', 'performance', 'was', 'typical', 'nice', 'guy', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'believe', 'comedy', 'errors', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'exonerating', 'was', 'STILL', 'painful', 'watch', 'not', 'performance', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'way', 'Karis', 'around', 'be', 'honest', 'BELIEVES', 'man', 'said', 'love', 'be', 'murderer', 'so', 'easily', 'well..The', 'movie', 'single', 'scene', 'wanted', 'least', 'something', 'said', 'characters', 'was', 'tender', 'moment', 'bittersweet', 'same', 'time', 'audience', 'hanging', 'left', 'hanging', 'being', 'said', 'did', 'LIKE', 'know', 'bit', 'contradictory', 'ultimately', 'heart']",N/A
