With the video it really enhances the pleasure to listen and see how the sound effects are producedespecially in the music ""An American in Paris"". Seiji Ozawa conducting never fail to amaze me with his feeling and enthusiasm.The Marcus Roberts Trio really offer a very pleasant bonus to the music blending very well the jazz rhythm with theclassical music, without over-powering them. The piano solo was precise and articulated, especially with the jazzarrangements.The DVD is a must for people who like music in light classical and jazz styles without compromise.

I love these classic works of Gershwin and it is said Concerto in F was his favorite.  Unfortunately, the Jazz trio played almost all the concert pieces from there on and ruined Concerto in F for me;  Rhapsody in Blue was almost unrecognizable in the hands of the trio.  I guess I really wanted a classical presentation with a LITTLE jazz.  This had far too much for me.  Highly disappointed and will probably give it away.",2,Too much of the jazz trio througout concert,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,539,"['orchestra', 'know', 'great', 'American', 'Paris', 'was', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'went', 'downhill', 'love', 'classic', 'works', 'Gershwin', 'said', 'Concerto', 'F', 'was', 'favorite', 'Unfortunately', 'Jazz', 'trio', 'played', 'almost', 'concert', 'pieces', 'there', 'ruined', 'Concerto', 'F', 'Rhapsody', 'Blue', 'was', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'hands', 'trio', 'guess', 'really', 'wanted', 'classical', 'presentation', 'LITTLE', 'jazz', 'had', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Highly', 'disappointed', 'will', 'probably', 'give', 'away']",N/A

I was suspecting the pianist is a blind man when I first watched the performance.  I bought the DVD just to see how Ozawa conducting the jazz music rather than classic music.  I watched Ozawa's conducting Vienna New Years concert in 2002 right before this one.  After such classic performance I wanted something more relax.  When I saw Ozawa leading the pianist out, I realized this is probably much difficult than what seemed to be on the DVD.  At first I was not sure if the pianist is good at what he is doing.  This may not be what Gershwin original intended way to express the music, but I like it for the sake of giving the less advantage person a chance to express his way to interpret the music.  I do not know how Seiji Ozawa and the whole Orchestra is able to work with a blind pianist who is not able to see the conductor.  A lot of effort must be put in to make it possible.  However, my mother had no problem to recognize the music when she heard them at all.  I enjoyed the American in Paris.  I am more impressed that the pianist is able to remember the music and plays like a normal pianist.  I have great respect to everyone who is involved in making this DVD possible for the audience.",4,What a conductor & pianist!,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,1346,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'performance', 'was', 'Arts', 'channel', 'like', 'Seiji', 'Ozawa', 'conducting', 'very', 'much', 'looked', 'so', 'cute', 'Tuxedo', 'was', 'suspecting', 'pianist', 'blind', 'man', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'performance', 'bought', 'DVD', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'Ozawa', 'conducting', 'jazz', 'music', 'rather', 'classic', 'music', 'watched', 'Ozawa', 'conducting', 'Vienna', 'New', 'Years', 'concert', '2002', 'right', 'one', 'such', 'classic', 'performance', 'wanted', 'something', 'more', 'relax', 'When', 'saw', 'Ozawa', 'leading', 'pianist', 'realized', 'probably', 'much', 'difficult', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'DVD', 'first', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'pianist', 'good', 'what', 'doing', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'Gershwin', 'original', 'intended', 'way', 'express', 'music', 'like', 'sake', 'giving', 'less', 'advantage', 'person', 'chance', 'express', 'way', 'interpret', 'music', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'Seiji', 'Ozawa', 'whole', 'Orchestra', 'able', 'work', 'blind', 'pianist', 'who', 'not', 'able', 'see', 'conductor', 'lot', 'effort', 'must', 'be', 'put', 'make', 'possible', 'However', 'mother', 'had', 'problem', 'recognize', 'music', 'when', 'heard', 'enjoyed', 'American', 'Paris', 'am', 'more', 'impressed', 'pianist', 'able', 'remember', 'music', 'plays', 'normal', 'pianist', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'everyone', 'who', 'involved', 'making', 'DVD', 'possible', 'audience']",N/A
871019,A306OBIN3PR1KP,B0006M4ROW,"Young Seok Park ""yspak""","[27, 29]","In this special concert, such popular Gershwin works as 'An American in Paris', 'Rhapsody in Blue' and 'Concerto in F'were performed by Berlin philharmonic (conductor: Seiji Ozawa) and Marcus Roberts Trio led by Marcus Roberts, one of the most renowned jazz pianists.Except the first one, the other two  were arranged by Marcus Roberts especially for the solo piano parts, and the rendition is actually far from the Gershwin's original. They sound a lot more jazzy than classical. Some might say ""This is not what I expected!"" because they are different that we have heard. I admit that three too long solo parts by the trio ruined the essence of the 'Rhapsody in Blue'. To me, however, the concert was still very enjoyable and entertainig maybe because I like jazz too. Marcus' piano was so great and sweet to listened to. (He's blind, by the way.) The trio also played ""I got Rhythm"" in their style.I think this concert is a special treat from both the world's finest orchestra Berlin Phil and the trio. This kind of concert is not usual at all. It is like ""once-in-a-life-time concert"". It was also fun to watch the Japanese conductor Seiji Ozawa, whose facial expressions were sometimes humorous and funny. I also liked the atmosphere of the open-air theater of the Berlin Waldbuhne. Camera work is not perfect but great. In extra feature ""They Got Rhythm"", Marcus Roberts Trio is introduced in details.  Sound formats include DD 5.1, DTS 5.1, PCM stereo. Sound/video quality is excellent.I recommend to any music lovers except those who want a pure classical performance.",5,Very entertaining and special performance...,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,1576,"['special', 'concert', 'such', 'popular', 'Gershwin', 'works', ""'An"", 'American', 'Paris', ""'Rhapsody"", 'Blue', ""'Concerto"", ""F'were"", 'performed', 'Berlin', 'philharmonic', 'conductor', 'Seiji', 'Ozawa', 'Marcus', 'Roberts', 'Trio', 'led', 'Marcus', 'Roberts', 'one', 'most', 'renowned', 'jazz', 'first', 'one', 'other', 'two', 'were', 'arranged', 'Marcus', 'Roberts', 'especially', 'solo', 'piano', 'parts', 'rendition', 'actually', 'far', 'Gershwin', 'original', 'sound', 'lot', 'more', 'jazzy', 'classical', 'might', 'say', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'are', 'different', 'have', 'heard', 'admit', 'three', 'too', 'long', 'solo', 'parts', 'trio', 'ruined', 'essence', ""'Rhapsody"", 'Blue', 'however', 'concert', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'entertainig', 'maybe', 'like', 'jazz', 'too', 'Marcus', 'piano', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'sweet', 'listened', 'blind', 'way', 'trio', 'also', 'played', 'got', 'Rhythm', 'style.I', 'think', 'concert', 'special', 'treat', 'world', 'finest', 'orchestra', 'Berlin', 'Phil', 'trio', 'kind', 'concert', 'not', 'usual', 'once-in-a-life-time', 'concert', 'was', 'also', 'fun', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'conductor', 'Seiji', 'Ozawa', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'sometimes', 'humorous', 'funny', 'also', 'liked', 'atmosphere', 'open-air', 'theater', 'Berlin', 'Waldbuhne', 'Camera', 'work', 'not', 'perfect', 'great', 'extra', 'feature', 'Got', 'Rhythm', 'Marcus', 'Roberts', 'Trio', 'introduced', 'details', 'Sound', 'formats', 'include', 'DD', '5.1', 'DTS', '5.1', 'PCM', 'stereo', 'Sound/video', 'quality', 'excellent.I', 'recommend', 'music', 'lovers', 'who', 'want', 'pure', 'classical', 'performance']",N/A
