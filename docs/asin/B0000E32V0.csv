781017,AS558SNWF1DXG,B0000E32V0,Clare Quilty,"[5, 6]","When it comes to books-turned-into-movies, there's an eternal question: Is it better to see the movie before you read the book? Or should you read the book before you see the movie?I've always felt that reading a book can spoil a movie for a viewer, yet movies almost never ruin a good book for a reader because, well, there's just more there. And the fact is, the book is almost always better than the movie. With the exception of, maybe, &quot;The Godfather.&quot; And, so I'm told, &quot;The Bridges of Madison County.&quot; And &quot;Carrie.&quot; And most of the James Bond movies. And . . .Anyway, all this came to mind because I watched &quot;Buffalo Soldiers,&quot; a movie based on Robert O'Connor's novel. Joaquin Phoenix plays Ray Elwood, an Army specialist who's running drugs and black-market goods through his base in West Germany in the late '80s, about the time the Berlin Wall comes down. With the Cold War over, the soldiers grow bored, get slack and start giving in to badideas, such as tackle-football indoors and heroin.Meanwhile, like a crooked Ferris Bueller, Elwood scams his commanding officer (Ed Harris), fences anything not nailed down, collides with a no-nonsense sergeant (Scott Glenn) and ill-advisedly falls in love with the sergeant's daughter (Anna Paquin).The movie flirts with interesting ideas about peace and war and soldiers and criminals; it's well-made and nicely juggles drama and dark humor; and literally all the casting is perfect. But as a fan of the book, too many times during the movie I found myself buying hard-to-buy scenes (for example, the massive opium refinery Elwood assembles right on the base) because of what I knew from the novel, not from what the movie was telling me. Which made me wonder: Would I have liked the movie more if I didn't know the book? By the time I got to the film's forced &quot;happy&quot; ending (which plays out much differently than O'Connor imagined it), I realized that if the movie were better, the book wouldn't matter.",3,A movie about source and product (I prefer the source),1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,2008,"['When', 'books-turned-into-movies', 'eternal', 'question', 'better', 'see', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'should', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'reading', 'book', 'can', 'spoil', 'movie', 'viewer', 'movies', 'almost', 'never', 'ruin', 'good', 'book', 'reader', 'well', 'just', 'more', 'there', 'fact', 'book', 'almost', 'always', 'better', 'movie', 'exception', 'maybe', 'quot', 'Godfather.', 'quot', ""'m"", 'told', 'quot', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Carrie.', 'quot', 'most', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', '.Anyway', 'came', 'mind', 'watched', 'quot', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'movie', 'based', 'Robert', ""O'Connor"", 'novel', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Ray', 'Elwood', 'Army', 'specialist', 'who', 'running', 'drugs', 'black-market', 'goods', 'base', 'West', 'Germany', 'late', ""'80s"", 'time', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'down', 'Cold', 'War', 'soldiers', 'grow', 'bored', 'get', 'slack', 'start', 'giving', 'badideas', 'such', 'tackle-football', 'indoors', 'heroin.Meanwhile', 'crooked', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Elwood', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'fences', 'anything', 'not', 'nailed', 'down', 'collides', 'no-nonsense', 'sergeant', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'ill-advisedly', 'falls', 'love', 'sergeant', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Paquin', '.The', 'movie', 'flirts', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'peace', 'war', 'soldiers', 'criminals', 'well-made', 'nicely', 'juggles', 'drama', 'dark', 'humor', 'literally', 'casting', 'perfect', 'fan', 'book', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'found', 'buying', 'hard-to-buy', 'scenes', 'example', 'massive', 'opium', 'refinery', 'Elwood', 'assembles', 'right', 'base', 'what', 'knew', 'novel', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'telling', 'Which', 'made', 'wonder', 'Would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'book', 'time', 'got', 'film', 'forced', 'quot', 'happy', 'quot', 'ending', 'out', 'much', 'differently', ""O'Connor"", 'imagined', 'realized', 'movie', 'were', 'better', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter']",Buffalo Soldiers

This is  one of the more anti-military moives out there and watching the inner dark workings of subrosa crime within the military is not what the studios deemed as appropriate when it was due for release around the time of 911.  But now, a couple of years later, when we are hearing the stories of what happens in soldiers' minds when stressed (as in Vietnam, as in Iraq where the suicide rate is increasing) or when bored by the false security of a two year stint of isolation and that boredom encourages subterfuge, then this film noir makes sense, uncomfortably.Joaquin Phoenix makes the most of his role as the 'undercover agent' who pilfers goods for the black market on the German base of the US Army at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall 1989.  Ed Harris is terrific as the disillusioned officer-on-the-way-up who loses everything, and Scott Glenn is evil personified as the Top Sargent who comes on base and wipes it clean - if dastardly deeds can be termed 'clean'.  Elizabeth McGovern proves she can still vamp, and Anna Paquin is growing into a fine actress.  So even if the story is a bit on the slight side we still have some fine actors to observe.  There are shortcomings here, chief among them is the rather flatline of the speaking and the action.

Lee (Scott Glenn) catches wind of whats going and then sends in hisArmy goons to steal Ellwood's stuff, he then proceeds to makeEllwood's life a living hell while Ellwood is now targetedfor death if he doesnt have the merchandise to sell by hisdrug dealing friends.Ellwood hatches a scheme to tick of Sgt. Lee by investigatinghis personal files then dating his daughter who knows all toowell about her maniacal father.When these two guys collide , sparks will fly and eventuallyat the end of the movie you see that military isnt quite, theskeaky clean, moral image they portray to be in those propaganda ""all you can be"" commercials.Ed Harris is also great as Col.

It's really much more sympathetic and amusing than I expected, though it has its' dark moments too.  I would suggest that those viewing it not take things too seriously and don't go into it thinking this is going to be a documentary about real life in the military--its' not that kind of movie.  As the bonus material indicates, the point of the movie is that it was supposed to take place in 1989, the end of the Cold War, when for a short period it was believed that this was a good thing that was happening and that it might be the end of wars.  (The cynical among us knew better, of course, and can scoff at such misconception now.) The result is that without a real war, some will create their own, out of boredom or whatever.Anyway, all that said, this movie worked for me.  As usual, actor Joaquin Phoenix takes an unethical, uncaring opportunist and gives the audience permission to like him and root for him, even though he's not a traditional good guy.  His character, Ray Ellwood, has just the right mix of charming wit and inevitable screw up.  This is a character that the audience could have just written off as an idiot and a bad guy without the nuances and layers Phoenix brought (and always brings) to his roles.I liked the German scenery, thought the music was great, loved the mix of comedy and tenseness.There's a couple of great twists at the end of the film too.

781026,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,B0000E32V0,Jessica Lux,"[11, 11]","Buffalo Soldiers is the story of US Army supply clerk Ray Elwood, played by the handsome and mysterious Joaquin Phoenix.  Elwood is one of those go-to-guys who can score anything you need in exchange for the right favor.  He has his hands all over the supply chain, drives a sweet German sports car, and knows who to cook up a batch of heroin in spare warehouses.  He's a stoic who is well-respected by his peers.  He helps his goofball desk jockey boss (played by Ed Harris) keep the base in West Germany in line.Elwood's life is thrown into personal and romantic turmoil with the arrival of Sgt. Lee (played by Scott Glenn) and his beautiful daughter (Anna Paquin).  Sgt. Lee has a personal goal of cleaning house and exposing Elwood's dabblings in the black market.  Elwood, of course, decides to antagonize Lee by dating his daughter, and then he falls hard for the young lady.  The movie is a dark game of cat and mouse between Lee and Elwood, with the base commander bumbling around in the background in truly comedic fashion.  With a few healthy plot twists and elements of both satire and horror, Buffalo Soldiers is a movie to catch on DVD for anyone who likes dark drama/comedy in which the viewer ends up rooting for a handsome ""bad guy.""

This was days before  9/11 when terrorists flew aircrafts into the World Trade Center and Pentagon.  Miramax held the film back in concern of how some might react to the anti-war message depicted in the film.  Almost a year and half later during the Sundance Film Festival, a woman verbally assaulted the filmmakers by stating that they were anti-American for making the film as she threw a water bottle towards the screen that accidentally hit Anna Paquin.  Having this background information prior seeing the film brings the audience to the story in a completely different light, which builds up a pre-viewing atmosphere full of notions.Buffalo Soldiers is an interesting story about Specialist Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix) who runs all kinds of scams on his military base in Germany during the final days of the Cold War when the Berlin Wall is about to plunge.  When the new Top Sergeant Lee arrives to his base, there seems to be a new sheriff in town.  Lee also happens to bring his daughter Robyn (Anna Paquin) who falls for Elwood.  This is a recipe for disaster as Elwood discovers that he also has feelings for Robyn, and Robyn's father is out to get him by all means necessary.  Buffalo Soldiers is a comic anti-war drama that is depicted through an atmosphere of boredom among young adults without much life experience and a lot of responsibility.  This restlessness among the soldiers is captured with precise directing by Jordan and a good performance by the cast, which leaves the audience with a fine cinematic experience.",4,Restless soldiers...a good thing?,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,1652,"['Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'had', 'first', 'official', 'release', 'Canada', 'Toronto', 'Film', 'Festival', 'September', '8', '2001', 'was', 'days', '9/11', 'when', 'terrorists', 'flew', 'aircrafts', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Pentagon', 'Miramax', 'held', 'film', 'back', 'concern', 'how', 'might', 'react', 'anti-war', 'message', 'depicted', 'film', 'Almost', 'year', 'half', 'later', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'woman', 'verbally', 'assaulted', 'filmmakers', 'stating', 'were', 'anti-American', 'making', 'film', 'threw', 'water', 'bottle', 'screen', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Having', 'background', 'information', 'prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'audience', 'story', 'completely', 'different', 'light', 'up', 'pre-viewing', 'atmosphere', 'full', 'notions.Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'interesting', 'story', 'Specialist', 'Ray', 'Elwood', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'kinds', 'scams', 'military', 'base', 'Germany', 'final', 'days', 'Cold', 'War', 'when', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'plunge', 'When', 'new', 'Top', 'Sergeant', 'Lee', 'base', 'be', 'new', 'sheriff', 'town', 'Lee', 'also', 'bring', 'daughter', 'Robyn', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'Elwood', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'Elwood', 'discovers', 'also', 'feelings', 'Robyn', 'Robyn', 'father', 'out', 'get', 'means', 'necessary', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'comic', 'anti-war', 'drama', 'depicted', 'atmosphere', 'boredom', 'young', 'adults', 'much', 'life', 'experience', 'lot', 'responsibility', 'restlessness', 'soldiers', 'captured', 'precise', 'directing', 'Jordan', 'good', 'performance', 'cast', 'audience', 'fine', 'cinematic', 'experience']",Buffalo Soldiers

I can promise you, this film is not over the top and it's not necessarily taking any artistic license.Not that every soldier was like Elwood and the rest of them.  There were plenty of people who were very strait laced and did their job profesionally.  But there were also plenty of people just like the ones in this film, and all of this stuff and worse did take place in the real US Army in this period.  In fact I knew a guy who was eerily like Joachim Phoenixes character in this movie.

Look it up online if you don't believe it.  There were shootings on base, smuggling and theft rings, drug rings.  Horrible racial incidents.  Corruption.  Riots between different Army units.  Just like in the movie there were horrible ""training"" accidents in which numerous G.I.'s were injured and killed.  Routinely.

His unit gets a new Top Sergeant (Scott Glenn) at the same time Elwood and his partners have an opportunity to sell some arms for enough money to retire on. Sergeant Lee is bent on crushing their operation and Elwood's swagger. The arms sale is complicating their lives. And Elwood has fallen for his enemy's daughter (Anna Paquin).&quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; is a hilarious black comedy based on the book of the same name by  Robert O'Conner and directed by Gregor Jordan. The film has been widely admonished for presenting an unflattering picture of U.S. military personnel. &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; doesn't comment much on officers, except to say that some are blind to what goes on under their noses. The film is about enlisted men stationed to West Germany during the last years of the Cold War &quot;with nothing to kill except time.&quot; These soldiers are overwhelmingly idiots, sociopaths and junkies. But they sure are funny. I spent the summer of 1983 near a U.S. Army base in West Germany, and I can attest to the strangeness of base life and the feeling that the enlisted men are purposeless. I also had an acquaintance who was stationed to West Germany in the early 1990s. He was a lot like the soldiers in the movie. In fact, of five people I have known who enlisted in the Army or Navy, four resemble characters in this film. So however unflattering &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; may be, I am inclined to believe that it is a realistic portrait of base life at a specific time and place. The cast of the film is just wonderful. Joaquin Phoenix and Scott Glenn are perfect in every way. The supporting cast delivers equally impressive and thoroughly enjoyable performances. It's nice to see Ed Harris in a comic role. His talent is not wasted here as Elwood's earnest but naive commanding officer. &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. It has smart darkly comic writing, good construction, and gutsy performances that never fail to entertain. It's one of the most enjoyable films in recent memory. But it's a very dark comedy that dabbles in tragedy as well. And it's unflattering to at least some U.S. military personnel. If that doesn't bother you, don't miss this film! I give &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;  my highest recommendation.The DVD: Bonus features include a short &quot;making of&quot; documentary, an &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; featurette that concentrates on the scenes surrounding Elwood's acquisition of the weapons, and an audio commentary by director Gregor Jordan. The bonus features aren't terribly exciting, but I think the audio commentary is more worth your time than the other stuff. Dubbing is available in French.

It also is especially entertaining to those havingserved in the military.The story captures well the self-contained world of the military, interms of bases, discipline, the constant reminder of belonging to agroup, and the expectations imposed that must be met in terms ofuniformity, and standards that  met by all in innumerable aspects ofconduct. The picture shows a few of these: the mess, drills, marches,deployment exercises, etc.  It also brings  up the physical andmental stress of being in a chain of command, where there is nooutsider, per se, who can come to a soldier's rescue, if there ismisconduct, abuse of authority, physical violence, even to one's lifein extreme and rare cases of bullying.An intriguing suggestion made by the movie, is that the volunteernature of enrollment (vs. conscription) has resulted in a lack ofrecruited manpower, leading the Army to force convicts to serve, suchthat many of these bring their prior shady activities to their newplace of employment. We see drug users and drug labs built on an Armybase,  narco-trafficking, as well as black market reselling of Armycommodities. The picture shows the numerous tentacles of thoseoperations, as perhaps 30 or more are on the take, to look the otherway, or participate actively.The entertainment goal is met, such as from a few moments of juvenilehumor (a tank runs over a car, gas station), or  the  mini-romancewith Phoenix and a teenage girl, played by Anna Paquin, but mostlyfrom thrill and action aspects, culminating in a climax ofexplosions, and a fire fight  and man-to-man combat.Some interesting lessons are learned by Phoenix, as he tries to pullout of his deal, being told by the international arms dealer that hecan't do that, under penalty of losing his life, as up until then hewas small-time, dealing only with commodities, not rifles or grenadelaunchers.The story also underlines how some individuals in the chain ofcommand (in civilian life, supervisors, bosses, but here, officers,sergeants) due to lack of oversight can create their own rules, andget away with it, preparing an ordeal for their rivals in theorganization, such that they are themselves the judge, jury andexecutioner, later leaving appearances of either a suicide event orof an accident of their coworkers.Overall, this work is entertaining because it intentionally doesn'ttake itself too seriously, has a charismatic cast, the requiredingredients for an action film, and a sufficient plot to keep peopleinterested for 90 mins.",2,"Entertaining action film, sufficient plot and charismatic cast",1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,2721,"['BUFFALO', 'SOLDIERS', '2001', 'interest', 'fans', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'who', 'comprise', 'star', 'cast', 'picturetaking', 'placing', 'West', 'Germany', 'Cold', 'War', 'ended', 'theBerlin', 'Wall', 'fell', 'also', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'havingserved', 'military.The', 'story', 'captures', 'well', 'self-contained', 'world', 'military', 'interms', 'bases', 'discipline', 'constant', 'reminder', 'belonging', 'agroup', 'expectations', 'imposed', 'must', 'be', 'met', 'terms', 'ofuniformity', 'standards', 'met', 'innumerable', 'aspects', 'ofconduct', 'picture', 'few', 'mess', 'drills', 'marches', 'deployment', 'exercises', 'etc', 'also', 'up', 'physical', 'andmental', 'stress', 'being', 'chain', 'command', 'where', 'nooutsider', 'se', 'who', 'can', 'come', 'soldier', 'rescue', 'ismisconduct', 'abuse', 'authority', 'physical', 'violence', 'even', 'one', 'lifein', 'extreme', 'rare', 'cases', 'bullying.An', 'intriguing', 'suggestion', 'made', 'movie', 'volunteernature', 'enrollment', 'conscription', 'resulted', 'lack', 'ofrecruited', 'manpower', 'leading', 'Army', 'force', 'convicts', 'serve', 'suchthat', 'many', 'bring', 'prior', 'shady', 'activities', 'newplace', 'employment', 'see', 'drug', 'users', 'drug', 'labs', 'built', 'Armybase', 'narco-trafficking', 'as', 'well', 'black', 'market', 'reselling', 'Armycommodities', 'picture', 'numerous', 'tentacles', 'thoseoperations', 'perhaps', '30', 'more', 'are', 'take', 'look', 'otherway', 'participate', 'actively.The', 'entertainment', 'goal', 'met', 'such', 'few', 'moments', 'juvenilehumor', 'tank', 'car', 'gas', 'station', 'mini-romancewith', 'Phoenix', 'teenage', 'girl', 'played', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'mostlyfrom', 'thrill', 'action', 'aspects', 'culminating', 'climax', 'ofexplosions', 'fire', 'fight', 'man-to-man', 'combat.Some', 'interesting', 'lessons', 'are', 'learned', 'Phoenix', 'pullout', 'deal', 'being', 'told', 'international', 'arms', 'dealer', 'heca', ""n't"", 'do', 'penalty', 'losing', 'life', 'then', 'hewas', 'small-time', 'dealing', 'only', 'commodities', 'not', 'grenadelaunchers.The', 'story', 'also', 'how', 'individuals', 'chain', 'ofcommand', 'civilian', 'life', 'supervisors', 'bosses', 'here', 'officers', 'sergeants', 'due', 'lack', 'oversight', 'can', 'create', 'own', 'rules', 'andget', 'away', 'preparing', 'ordeal', 'rivals', 'theorganization', 'such', 'are', 'judge', 'jury', 'andexecutioner', 'later', 'leaving', 'appearances', 'suicide', 'event', 'accident', 'coworkers.Overall', 'work', 'entertaining', 'intentionally', ""doesn'ttake"", 'too', 'seriously', 'charismatic', 'cast', 'requiredingredients', 'action', 'film', 'sufficient', 'plot', 'keep', 'peopleinterested', '90', 'mins']",Buffalo Soldiers

Zwick,"[1, 2]","Although the opening shot of ""Buffalo Soldiers"" echoes the most famous image from ""Dr Strangelove,"" the real pedigree for this military satire lies in those twin hits from 1970, ""MASH"" and ""Catch-22.""  ""Buffalo Soldiers"" presents us with an army corps composed almost exclusively of drug users, narcotics dealers, bureaucratic bunglers and traffickers in stolen merchandise.  The prime culprit is battalion secretary Ray Elwood, the opportunist supreme who knows all the angles and can make the system work to his own benefit and advantage.  A criminal who was given service in the military over time in prison, Elwood has simply transferred all his illegal activities to the realm of army base life.  One day, however, Elwood meets his match in the form of one Sergeant Lee (the leathery Scott Glenn), a gruff no-nonsense commander, new to this German base, who is on to Elwood's antics and is determined to make life a living hell for him.""Buffalo Soldiers"" is a gutsy film in that it dares to take on a sacred cow institution and paint it in an unflattering light.  It is also willing to present us with a protagonist who has few, if any, redeeming qualities as a human being (though he does radiate glimmers of decency, at times, albeit not very convincing ones).  These are the film's two strongest virtues, yet they are also, paradoxically, its two greatest weaknesses.  Despite Joaquin Phoenix's superb, energetic performance in the role, Elwood just does not grab the viewer's sympathy in the way that, say, Hawkeye and Yossarrian do in ""MASH"" and ""Catch-22"" respectively.  Those characters could be shrewdly, cynically humorous about the flaws and hypocrisy in the military establishment, yet could still value what was good in the institution itself and the grunts who made up its ranks.  The problem with Elwood is that he is seen far more as the rule rather than the exception in the world scenarists Eric Weiss, Nora Maccoby and writer/director Gregor Jordan have created.  The film, though it obviously has valid points to make, feels so unbalanced in its approach that it ends up weakening its own moral case.  It's true that the other two films took place in a wartime setting and ""Buffalo Soldiers"" is set in peacetime 1989, but it still could use a bit more equity in its portrayal.All this wouldn't matter so much if the film displayed a finer sense of humor and a firmer grasp of tone, which ranges all the way from dead seriousness to cartoon-like caricature and slapstick.  There are a few deft and witty moments in the film, but they just don't come often enough to lift the comedy too far above the ordinary.Maybe ""MASH"" and ""Catch-22"" were more acceptable as satires because they weren't targeting just the military but the human propensity for war in general.  With no war operating in its background, ""Buffalo Soldiers"" seems to exist in a sort of satirical vacuum - making it, in the long run, a cynical exercise oddly devoid of relevance and point.",3,uneven satire,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,2977,"['opening', 'shot', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'most', 'famous', 'image', 'Dr', 'Strangelove', 'real', 'pedigree', 'military', 'satire', 'lies', 'twin', 'hits', '1970', 'MASH', 'Catch-22', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'army', 'corps', 'composed', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'drug', 'users', 'narcotics', 'dealers', 'bureaucratic', 'bunglers', 'traffickers', 'stolen', 'merchandise', 'prime', 'culprit', 'battalion', 'secretary', 'Ray', 'Elwood', 'opportunist', 'supreme', 'who', 'angles', 'can', 'make', 'system', 'work', 'own', 'benefit', 'advantage', 'criminal', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'service', 'military', 'time', 'prison', 'Elwood', 'simply', 'transferred', 'illegal', 'activities', 'realm', 'army', 'base', 'life', 'One', 'day', 'however', 'Elwood', 'match', 'form', 'one', 'Sergeant', 'Lee', 'leathery', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'gruff', 'no-nonsense', 'commander', 'new', 'German', 'base', 'who', 'Elwood', 'antics', 'determined', 'make', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'gutsy', 'film', 'take', 'sacred', 'cow', 'institution', 'paint', 'unflattering', 'light', 'also', 'willing', 'present', 'protagonist', 'who', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'human', 'being', 'radiate', 'glimmers', 'decency', 'times', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'ones', 'are', 'film', 'two', 'strongest', 'virtues', 'yet', 'are', 'also', 'paradoxically', 'two', 'greatest', 'weaknesses', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'superb', 'energetic', 'performance', 'role', 'Elwood', 'just', 'not', 'grab', 'viewer', 'sympathy', 'way', 'say', 'Hawkeye', 'Yossarrian', 'do', 'MASH', 'Catch-22', 'respectively', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'shrewdly', 'cynically', 'humorous', 'flaws', 'hypocrisy', 'military', 'establishment', 'yet', 'could', 'still', 'value', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'institution', 'grunts', 'who', 'made', 'up', 'ranks', 'problem', 'Elwood', 'seen', 'far', 'more', 'rule', 'rather', 'exception', 'world', 'Eric', 'Weiss', 'Nora', 'Maccoby', 'writer/director', 'Gregor', 'Jordan', 'have', 'created', 'film', 'obviously', 'valid', 'points', 'make', 'feels', 'so', 'unbalanced', 'approach', 'up', 'weakening', 'own', 'moral', 'case', 'true', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'took', 'place', 'wartime', 'setting', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'set', 'peacetime', '1989', 'still', 'could', 'use', 'bit', 'more', 'equity', 'portrayal.All', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'displayed', 'finer', 'sense', 'humor', 'firmer', 'grasp', 'tone', 'way', 'dead', 'seriousness', 'cartoon-like', 'caricature', 'slapstick', 'are', 'few', 'deft', 'witty', 'moments', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'often', 'enough', 'lift', 'comedy', 'too', 'far', 'ordinary.Maybe', 'MASH', 'Catch-22', 'were', 'more', 'acceptable', 'satires', 'were', ""n't"", 'targeting', 'just', 'military', 'human', 'propensity', 'war', 'general', 'war', 'operating', 'background', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'exist', 'sort', 'satirical', 'vacuum', 'making', 'long', 'run', 'cynical', 'exercise', 'oddly', 'devoid', 'relevance', 'point']",Buffalo Soldiers
781037,A3CH1KT8XQE8SA,B0000E32V0,"S. Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[1, 4]","BUFFALO SOLDIERS is a movie adaptation of Robert O'Connor's popular novel about a group of young U.S. soldiers at the Theodore Roosevelt U.S. Army Base in Stuttgart, West Germany in October 1989. Military clerk Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix) is the mastermind of the operation. Along with his GI pals he deals drugs, steals supplies, and has a thriving black-market business. But his schemes begin to unravel when Sergeant Lee (Scott Glenn) decides to investigate Elwood's activities. And to make matters worse, Elwood pursues Lee's daughter without his permission.While viewing this DVD I was constantly confused about the intention of this film. Is it a comedy or a drama? Did the directors want their audience to walk away with a serious impression or laugh all the way through to the credits? Unfortunately this film couldn't make up its mind. Some of the scenes contained screwball comedy elements reminiscent of classic military movies such as STRIPS (i.e., stoned soldiers causing havoc by running the tank though the town). Other scenes attempted to portray the heartfelt emotions of the characters (i.e., Ed Harris coming to grips with the end of his military career). But the two polar opposites never successfully united to create a good movie.I read all the press about this film when it was suppressed shortly after 9/11/01. But now after finally being able to watch it I can't believe that anybody had a problem with it. Clearly this is an instance of being hypersensitive. Why is this film controversial? It's surely not the first film to portray soldiers who don't follow protocol. What's more, it's set during 1989 - 15 years ago.In short, BUFFALO SOLDIERS simply didn't work for me. There were too many frayed loose ends at the end that detracted from the whole. It is surely unfortunate that wonderful actor abilities such as Ed Harris and Scott Glenn were wasted in this dismal film.",3,"""When there's peace, the war-like man attacks himself""",1074297600,"01 17, 2004",2004,1901,"['BUFFALO', 'SOLDIERS', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Robert', ""O'Connor"", 'popular', 'novel', 'group', 'young', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Base', 'Stuttgart', 'West', 'Germany', 'October', '1989', 'Military', 'clerk', 'Ray', 'Elwood', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'mastermind', 'operation', 'GI', 'pals', 'drugs', 'steals', 'supplies', 'thriving', 'black-market', 'business', 'schemes', 'begin', 'unravel', 'when', 'Sergeant', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'investigate', 'Elwood', 'activities', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Elwood', 'Lee', 'daughter', 'permission.While', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'was', 'constantly', 'confused', 'intention', 'film', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Did', 'directors', 'want', 'audience', 'walk', 'away', 'serious', 'impression', 'way', 'credits', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'scenes', 'contained', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'elements', 'reminiscent', 'classic', 'military', 'movies', 'such', 'STRIPS', 'i.e.', 'stoned', 'soldiers', 'causing', 'havoc', 'running', 'tank', 'town', 'Other', 'scenes', 'attempted', 'portray', 'heartfelt', 'emotions', 'characters', 'i.e.', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'coming', 'grips', 'end', 'military', 'career', 'two', 'polar', 'opposites', 'never', 'successfully', 'united', 'create', 'good', 'movie.I', 'read', 'press', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'suppressed', 'shortly', '9/11/01', 'now', 'finally', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anybody', 'had', 'problem', 'Clearly', 'instance', 'being', 'hypersensitive', 'Why', 'film', 'controversial', 'surely', 'not', 'first', 'film', 'portray', 'soldiers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'protocol', 'What', 'more', 'set', '1989', '15', 'years', 'ago.In', 'short', 'BUFFALO', 'SOLDIERS', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'frayed', 'loose', 'ends', 'end', 'detracted', 'whole', 'surely', 'unfortunate', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'abilities', 'such', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'were', 'wasted', 'dismal', 'film']",Buffalo Soldiers

781039,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0000E32V0,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 4]","""Buffalo Soldiers"" is essentially a version of Bill Murray's ""Stripes,"" but only told by a guy who is really, really angry.  It's still funny - even inspired, at times - but it's a humor fueled by rage.  And that rage causes the story to make a couple of missteps.Set in 1989 (note the perfect use of then-President Bush's plastic grin in several portraits) on an Army base in West Germany, ""Buffalo Soldiers"" informs the viewer that the majority of our fighting soldiers are simply there in order to escape a jail sentence.  As a result, thieves and drug dealers rule the roost - the top MP is a villainous heroin dealer.  The only virtuous soldier is the commanding officer, Colonel Berman (Ed Harris), who is a nice, incompetent buffoon more suited to running a vineyard than a regiment.  (This is a wonderful supporting performance by Harris, by the way.)Almost every Army movie has a ""scrounger,"" the guy who can get things done in the cracks of the system and usually with a lot of charm.  In ""Buffalo Soldiers,"" that is Private Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix), the company clerk.  We see early on how smooth Elwood is as he simultaneously covers up a drug dealing enterprise while protecting the honor of a soldier who was killed playing tackle football indoors while stoned on about ten different substances - including the Pill.  Elwood is a small-time heroin dealer who sells black market Mop & Glo and drives a Mercedes.  He is one of the princes of the criminal Army.His little realm gets invaded by ""Topper,"" Sergeant Robert Lee (Scott Glenn, easily the most sinister Sergeant ever).  Lee sizes up Elwood in an instant and brings him down about fifteen pegs - look for an inspired scene involving Lee's bullying of Elwood via ""target practice.""  Lee is unbribable, connected to the general, but also dangerous in that Scott Glenn way.Elwood also has his little world come apart due to a stoned tank crew on maneuvers.  Intoxication leads to two dead American trucks drivers and two trucks full of unclaimed assault rifles.  Elwood stumbles across the guns and instantly sees an angle.  But he is forced by his connection to take raw narcotics rather than cash as compensation.  Elwood, who makes his money by cooking the drugs into a distributable product, is soon playing a game that he does not control, and the bodies begin to mount up.This is not one of those movies that gently mocks the Army while honoring it.  There is nothing gentle or honorable in ""Buffalo Soldiers.""  It is funny.  It is dark.  And it pulls no punches.

Aside from the minor skirmish here and there, fully trained and fully armed soldiers have a lot of time on their hands, idle hands with unbridled access to weapons and drugs. Surely makes for a funny predicament for a film!Among the actors, Phoenix has a remarkable way of playing negative characters, and yet making the audience care about his characters (e.g., in Gladiator.)

I say this not because I wanted to show my historical knowledge (sorry, I confess, I did).  I say this because I still don't know why the film (or the original book) uses the name?  What's the point?This is exactly what I was thinking while watching this film.  It is a satire, to be sure.  I can see it when Joaquin Phoenix appears as Elwood, US soldier in Germany just before the Cold War ended, and acts like an anti-hero -- stealing, cooking cocaine, etc.  I don't know whether or not his outrageous deeds are based on truths, but I know such dark comedy films as ""MASH"" and ""Catch 22,"" and you don't need to be offended seeing these things on screen.  Even if the tank runs like mad on the town's market, 'squishing' the cars and stalls; even if Ed Harris's Col. Berman is, good-natured as he is, hopelessly inept as an officer.  Scott Glen's sardonic sergeant Lee (another reference to the Civil War?), according to his daughter Robyn (Anna Paquin), is delighted to 'kill' Elwood, just like he did in the previous war in Vietnam.  And her burnt skin testifies to her words.  All these elements point to one thing only.Right, if the things went this too far, this film must be a satire. But against what?  The film is about that particular time between the long Cold War and the Gulf War, the curiously 'peaceful' period when nations in the world were keeping the military balance in a precarious way.  But that old time is gone forever, and we should know that now.  It is Miramax who knows it best when it had to delay the release date many times.However, for all its uniformly good acting, the film looks irrelevant now.  It's about those soliders living at that time and that place.  It's not 'Three Kings' whose setting is more immediate to us.  It's not 'Catch 22' whose absurd situations reminded us of our equally absurd existence.  And of course, the film is not about the soldiers in Iraq (if so, this could never be released).With all respect to the film and its makers, it is truism, or cliche, to say that 'Buffalo Soldiers' is darkly funny, hilarious attack on the US military system, and so on and on.  The film is not boring, but it ends there, nothing more.  Aussie director Gregor Jordan made 'Ned Kelly' after this, and it also lacked a strong center or theme around which the events should be depicted.
