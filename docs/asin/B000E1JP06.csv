I can't wait for that to happen. I have seen them in concert and they are worthy of all the buzz.Until that time I'll just consider Undressed a precursor.This video highlights the after the show camaraderie.Musicians who are co-workers and friends, chilling out afterperforming for thousands. No pressure, just doing it for the love of the music and the opportunity to hang out.I liked the acoustic sound of the songs.Gretchen may be THE NAME, but she doesn't hog the spotlight.Her lead guitarist Dean Hall sings several songs, and very well!The band members talk about working with Gretchen and vice versa. I am a recent fan, and liked learning about theRedneck Woman and her life on the road.One nit-pik: I really wished the band had been introduced.You can catch who is who in the credits.I will say, I am glad I didn't pay full price for it.I will watch it again, but I don't think it is one that I will replaya blue million times.",4,Gretchen and Friends,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,1077,"['really', 'liked', 'unpretentious', 'look', 'Gretchen', 'band.Would', 'have', 'preferred', 'live', 'amped', 'out', 'filmed', 'arena', 'performance', 'Hell', 'Yeah', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'happen', 'have', 'seen', 'concert', 'are', 'worthy', 'buzz.Until', 'time', ""'ll"", 'just', 'consider', 'Undressed', 'precursor.This', 'video', 'highlights', 'show', 'camaraderie.Musicians', 'who', 'are', 'co-workers', 'friends', 'chilling', 'out', 'afterperforming', 'thousands', 'pressure', 'just', 'doing', 'love', 'music', 'opportunity', 'hang', 'out.I', 'liked', 'acoustic', 'sound', 'songs.Gretchen', 'may', 'be', 'THE', 'NAME', ""n't"", 'hog', 'spotlight.Her', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Dean', 'Hall', 'several', 'songs', 'very', 'well', 'band', 'members', 'talk', 'working', 'Gretchen', 'vice', 'versa', 'am', 'recent', 'fan', 'liked', 'learning', 'theRedneck', 'Woman', 'life', 'road.One', 'nit-pik', 'really', 'wished', 'band', 'had', 'been', 'introduced.You', 'can', 'catch', 'who', 'who', 'credits.I', 'will', 'say', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'it.I', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'will', 'replaya', 'blue', 'million', 'times']",N/A

Nope, it's a Jam Session with a bunch of band members and friends back stage after a concert. It's still entertaining enough, but more of her friends singing and playing than she does. It's good, but I love the voice of Gretchen and would have liked it to be mostly about HER.

965128,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B000E1JP06,Mike,"[6, 6]","There's no doubt about the fact that Gretchen's a ""country singer,"" but there's a lot more under the surface for those who are willing to look. She's actually a performer who can comfortably step outside of the ""CMT"" boundaries...WAY out. I really had my eyes opened when I saw her performance on VH1's ""Heart: Decades Live."" She started out with a nice duet with Ann Wilson on Heart's hit ""Even It Up,"" but then the two jumped head-first into a faithful, energetic reading of Led Zeppelin's ""Rock and Roll."" This lady's got the pipes, no doubt about it. They didn't do a ""polite"" version of the song...they went for the throat. It was a genuine ""goose bump"" moment. So yes, this DVD is brief, and yes, the price is reasonable for the content offered (I paid ten bucks for mine). Gretchen is, and probably will remain, a ""country singer,"" and there's a certain amount of loyalty and sticking to tradition that audience expects. But the performers who are in it for the long haul are also rewarded with the freedom to try new things and expand their boundaries, and if there's one thing I've learned about Gretchen in the last couple of years, it's the fact that there's a lot...a LOT...more going on than ""Skoal Ring."" She's the performer to watch. She's got the looks, the talent, and she seems to be wearing her success up to this point very well.

I'm not a big country fan but I liked what I heard. After I checked the TV listings and found the show wasn't scheduled to be shown again, I checked to see if it was available on DVD. And here we are. While I wouldn't pay $20 for this DVD due to limited content, I was more than happy to take it for a fraction of that. Gretchen and her band sound great in what is really an acoustic jam session after a concert featuring songs from ""All Jacked Up"".
