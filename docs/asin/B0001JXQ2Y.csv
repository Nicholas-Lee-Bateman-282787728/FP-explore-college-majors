808740,A1B53UQIMZHOVN,B0001JXQ2Y,Anthony Caton,"[10, 11]","Out of the dozens of Westerns that premiered on television in the mid 1950's, &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel,&quot; is still arguably the best.  Richard Boone brought a distinct style of elegance and intelligence to the role of &quot;Paladin.&quot;  Paladin preferred to reason his way out of difficulty, but was prepared to use his imposing, custom-made revolver to settle a score; always drawing second, but forever being true to his target.  &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel,&quot; ran for six seasons on CBS (1957-63), and often finished third in the Nielsen Top Ten during it's run, behind &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train.&quot;  Boone was offered a seventh season by CBS but decided to leave the program and begin his own anthology series on NBC, &quot;The Richard Boone Show,&quot; which featured Robert Blake, Ford Rainey, and Harry Morgan, among others.Video tapes of the program have long been offered by Columbia House, but, for the first time, DVD's are now available from CBS.  The complete first season is enclosed in an attractive six-pack jacket.  Video quality is the same as the VHS tapes; what is surprising is that the sound quality is only fair, at best.  Among the few features available on the DVD's is a biography of the primary guest star of each program.Performers to be found on &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; during the first season, are future stars Charles Bronson, Angie Dickinson, Stuart Whitman, Dan Blocker, Warren Oates, Jack Lord, and Pernell Roberts.  More likely you'll see terrific character actors such as R.G. Armstrong, Leo Gordon, John Carradine, Roy Barcroft, Denver Pyle, Robert Wilke, Murray Hamilton, Harold J. Stone, Ed Binns, Henry Brandon, Whit Bissell, Strother Martin, John Dehner, Anthony Caruso, and Claude Akins.Amazon has offered the complete first season for a reasonable price.  My advice?

808741,A2XXV9HF169LCF,B0001JXQ2Y,A. Trotter,"[3, 3]","Let me tell you a little something. I'm a thirtysomething woman from New England, a reader and traveler who works full time in a technical field. The western genre was never a big part of my life as a child; to this day the theme song for Bonanza gives me a case of the shudders. And yet somehow this series, an overly dramatic black and white western with terrible audio quality, is a real delight to me.Originally, I bought it because I was curious about the closing credits song: Stephen King's ""Stand By Me"" left an indellible impression on my mind, and the song the boys sang made me deeply curious about the series that inspired it. I put it on my wish list and contemplated it for a while; in a slow season for new releases I bought it. It sat on my shelf waiting for a long night when I was tired of reading and willing to give it a chance; a patient show, because it took a long time for me to come around. But once I started watching I couldn't stop. I've been sneaking an episode or six in every chance I could get, when I was supposed to be sleeping or eating or cleaning - Plunk in front of the TV, pop in the disk and gobble up a couple more episodes.I have to admit that there were personal moments of ""A Ha!' for me. I watched a lot of Star Trek as a kid, and realized partway into this series that Gene Rodenburry was a director; I then spotted moments and characters that struck a familiar chord. The Aramenian dancing woman is deeply reminiscent of the Orion women form the original Trek; or perhaps the other way around. The character Ella West should sing deja vu to anyone who watched Natasha Yarr in the Next Generation.There are other cliches: the dive for the gun, the terrible fight scenes, the balsawood studio sets. It's fun for me to see where the cliches come from, as I missed them the first time around. The effects, by today's standards, are abysmial. But the characterization and intelligent writing are wonderful.All in all I love this show. The depictions of violence are so tame by today's standards, and the hero insists on attempting to use brains and nonviolent means in every situation before resorting to a gun, so I'd feel completely comfortable loaning it to my friends with young kids. But the hero is a professional gunslinger who chases women, drinks, smokes and gambles; he's a rogue and a poet, so it's not boring for adults either.",5,A rogue and a poet with a quick gun hand.,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,2381,"['Let', 'tell', 'little', 'something', ""'m"", 'thirtysomething', 'woman', 'New', 'England', 'reader', 'traveler', 'who', 'full', 'time', 'technical', 'field', 'western', 'genre', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'part', 'life', 'child', 'day', 'theme', 'song', 'Bonanza', 'case', 'shudders', 'yet', 'somehow', 'series', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'black', 'white', 'western', 'terrible', 'audio', 'quality', 'real', 'delight', 'me.Originally', 'bought', 'was', 'curious', 'closing', 'credits', 'song', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Stand', 'Me', 'left', 'indellible', 'impression', 'mind', 'song', 'boys', 'sang', 'made', 'deeply', 'curious', 'series', 'inspired', 'put', 'wish', 'list', 'contemplated', 'while', 'slow', 'season', 'new', 'releases', 'bought', 'sat', 'shelf', 'waiting', 'long', 'night', 'when', 'was', 'tired', 'reading', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'patient', 'show', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'around', 'once', 'started', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sneaking', 'episode', 'six', 'chance', 'could', 'get', 'when', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sleeping', 'eating', 'cleaning', 'Plunk', 'front', 'TV', 'pop', 'disk', 'gobble', 'up', 'couple', 'more', 'episodes.I', 'have', 'admit', 'were', 'personal', 'moments', 'A', 'Ha', 'watched', 'lot', 'Star', 'Trek', 'kid', 'realized', 'partway', 'series', 'Gene', 'Rodenburry', 'was', 'director', 'then', 'spotted', 'moments', 'characters', 'struck', 'familiar', 'chord', 'Aramenian', 'dancing', 'woman', 'deeply', 'reminiscent', 'Orion', 'women', 'form', 'original', 'Trek', 'perhaps', 'other', 'way', 'character', 'Ella', 'West', 'should', 'sing', 'deja', 'vu', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Natasha', 'Yarr', 'Next', 'Generation.There', 'are', 'other', 'cliches', 'dive', 'gun', 'terrible', 'fight', 'scenes', 'balsawood', 'studio', 'sets', 'fun', 'see', 'where', 'cliches', 'come', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'effects', 'today', 'standards', 'are', 'abysmial', 'characterization', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'are', 'wonderful.All', 'love', 'show', 'depictions', 'violence', 'are', 'so', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'hero', 'attempting', 'use', 'brains', 'nonviolent', 'means', 'situation', 'resorting', 'gun', ""'d"", 'feel', 'completely', 'comfortable', 'loaning', 'friends', 'young', 'kids', 'hero', 'professional', 'gunslinger', 'who', 'women', 'drinks', 'smokes', 'gambles', 'rogue', 'poet', 'not', 'boring', 'adults']",N/A

When they are finally distributed and bought, it is a shocker to find that they are sophomoric or just long cigarette commercials. Well this time you will not be disappointed.Each episode must find a conflict and solve it in an extraordinarily short time. Each with a moral and still maintain the entertainment value. One of the ways this is accomplished is the use of a wide spectrum of writers; many of the stories are adoptions of classics or became classics of other programs and/or movies.Each episode is accompanied by a synopses of the story, which by the way is very well done and points out the purpose of the story.  Also each episode has a small but interesting biography of the main actors.One of the finer points of this series is that there usually is no clear cut hero or villain as the characters and themes of the stories are as complete as many ancient myths.  We can see virtues and faults in everyone and many times there is no such thing as a clear-cut winner or loser.Paladin (Richard Boone), a well chosen name as on a chess board there are many moves available, lives in San Francisco and most people assumes he has investments all over the west as he is taking frequent trips to protect them. We know different as ""Have Gun Will Travel"" he makes his fortune on his many skills.  Every once in a while we get a gimps of his past as we know he went to West Point and can quote many ancient writings and wars. He has an uncanny way of knowing what the meanings of names are. Yet who ever he really is many people are better off for knowing him.

808745,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,B0001JXQ2Y,Daniel Hurley,"[8, 8]","Richard Boone may have been the first 'man in black' as he plays Paladin, the highly educated and affluent gentleman who resides in a luxry hotel in San Francisco where each day he scans the papers looking for conflicts that he will resolve by hiring out his gun. Boone's charcter is West Point trained in military affairs, is a veteran, ladys man, he knows the arts, Shakespear and he is somewhat of a psychologist and scientist as he seems to know a lot about everything while still maintaining a background of mystery. He makes his living by hiring out his gun to primarily settle disputes or ocassionally bring some one in. The twist is that he is highly ethical and he evaluates each situation individually and he may even change sides. A classic example in the first year collection is when he is hired by a prisoner under arrest to make sure he survives in a vigilante town until he makes trial. Paladin provides protection but stops the prisoner from making a jail break, his agreement is to protect him until he gets his trial, he does get to trial and he hangs. Paladin is known by his calling card: ""Have Gun Will Travel, Wire Paladin San Francisco"" with the symbol of a chess piece knight etched on the card. The same knight is on his holster. Paladin frequently resolves disputes with his head but he is known for being a fast drawing gunfighter who shoots with accuracy and he does frequently. The first year as well as the subsequent years feature current stars of the 50s and many budding stars of the future. The video quality is surprisingly good and much better than the grainy versions last seen on local TV. The best way to watch is on DVD particularly since each episode has a menu that includes a plot line and a list of prominent guest stars. Amazing that ""Have Gun"" was criticized in it's day for being too violent, which after watching, you will find it more intellectual, action packed but less violent than TV today. Running from 1957 to 63, this was truly a unique show, and often amusing particular when Paladin would quote Shakespear or a poet such as Shelly while in remote areas of the west often having to translate the meaning. Now they need to release the last season that contains the episode ""Genesis"" that reveals how our central charcter became 'Paladin'.",5,HIgh Quality Video of one of the Most Unique Westerns,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,2295,"['Richard', 'Boone', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'first', ""'man"", 'black', 'Paladin', 'highly', 'educated', 'affluent', 'gentleman', 'who', 'luxry', 'hotel', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'day', 'papers', 'looking', 'conflicts', 'will', 'resolve', 'hiring', 'out', 'gun', 'Boone', 'charcter', 'West', 'Point', 'trained', 'military', 'affairs', 'veteran', 'ladys', 'man', 'arts', 'Shakespear', 'somewhat', 'psychologist', 'scientist', 'know', 'lot', 'everything', 'still', 'maintaining', 'background', 'mystery', 'living', 'hiring', 'out', 'gun', 'primarily', 'settle', 'disputes', 'ocassionally', 'bring', 'one', 'twist', 'highly', 'ethical', 'situation', 'individually', 'may', 'even', 'change', 'sides', 'classic', 'example', 'first', 'year', 'collection', 'when', 'hired', 'prisoner', 'arrest', 'make', 'sure', 'vigilante', 'town', 'trial', 'Paladin', 'protection', 'prisoner', 'making', 'jail', 'break', 'agreement', 'protect', 'trial', 'get', 'trial', 'Paladin', 'known', 'calling', 'card', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'Wire', 'Paladin', 'San', 'Francisco', 'symbol', 'chess', 'piece', 'knight', 'etched', 'card', 'same', 'knight', 'holster', 'Paladin', 'frequently', 'disputes', 'head', 'known', 'being', 'fast', 'drawing', 'gunfighter', 'who', 'accuracy', 'frequently', 'first', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'subsequent', 'years', 'feature', 'current', 'stars', '50s', 'many', 'budding', 'stars', 'future', 'video', 'quality', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'much', 'better', 'grainy', 'versions', 'last', 'seen', 'local', 'TV', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'DVD', 'particularly', 'episode', 'menu', 'plot', 'line', 'list', 'prominent', 'guest', 'stars', 'Amazing', 'Have', 'Gun', 'was', 'criticized', 'day', 'being', 'too', 'violent', 'watching', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'intellectual', 'action', 'packed', 'less', 'violent', 'TV', 'today', 'Running', '1957', '63', 'was', 'truly', 'unique', 'show', 'often', 'amusing', 'particular', 'when', 'Paladin', 'would', 'quote', 'Shakespear', 'poet', 'such', 'Shelly', 'remote', 'areas', 'west', 'often', 'having', 'translate', 'meaning', 'Now', 'need', 'release', 'last', 'season', 'episode', 'Genesis', 'how', 'central', 'charcter', 'became', ""'Paladin""]",N/A

Though a man of refinement, he made his living by hiring his gun out to those in need.  He passed his little cards around - &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel.  Wire Paladin, San Fransisco&quot; and waited for clients to find him.While a cultured man, he was just as comfortable in the deadly knight errant persona, the man in black.  Boone excelled at making you believe both sides could exist within one man.  While he was a hired gun, he often spent more time talking to people making them listen to reason.A loved all these Westerns.  Have enjoyed the reruns on TVLand, Starz Westerns, and the Hallmark Channel.  But so many of the old Westerns don't hold up well.  I was surprised how well Rawhide and Have Gun, Will Travel hold their quality.  So these are a super addition to any video maven's collection.

For example, women's hair-dos and makeup were often quite modern. Have Gun-Will Travel is not free of this nonsense, but you can see the extra effort they made to be accurate by observing the foreground and background objects instead of focusing on the action. The right curtains are on the window, the right dishes and silverware are on the table, and the extras wore clothing made out of the appropriate fabric. And, it doesn't stop there - When Paladin reads a note in Chinese, he reads it top to bottom, right to left. When he reloads his belt with fresh ammunition, he examines each bullet as if his life depends on it (you know the rest). Also, they often got out of the two-dimensional constraints of the studio and shot on location, which helps a lot with the suspension of disbelief. Being very modern for its time helps it hold up almost as well as Gunsmoke and Wanted - Dead or Alive. Mr. Boone is better than this role, but I am very glad that he took the part.

Lambeth,"[7, 12]","If the audio quality of Have Gun Will Travel were as good as the quality of the programs themselves, I would've given this set 5 stars.Unfortunately, the audio is surprisingly poor. The volume of the programs is much softer than the volume of the Main Menu screen. The sound also isn't as clear as it should be for today's technology. Cranking the volume when the show starts, and emersing yourself in the stories themselves takes care of the problem, but it's still annoying.The extra features of the DVD's are minimal. With each episode, you can choose a Wire Paladin option, which will give you a little background about some of the actors on the show, some of the plots, info on the writers, etc. Usually it's not much more than half a page worth of brief info. On most episodes, you'll also have a Guest Cast option (I believe this option isn't available in Disk 4 of the set) which gives a brief history on one or a few of the actors in the chosen episode. Some of it's elementary, and some of it is interesting. Still, nothing more than this text. No interviews, no ""making of""...nothing about the overall history of the show itself. A funny thing about these two extras: In the episode in which John Dehner stars, a biography was given about Dehner, but no mention was made of Dehner being cast as Paladin in the radio version of Have Gun Will Travel (and did an excellent job at it, too). I figured, 'maybe they left out Dehner's credit of the radio series because most knew about it'. If that was the case, then Denver Pyle wouldn't have been mentioned in separate episodes as playing Uncle Jesse in the Dukes of Hazzard.The lack of quality extras isn't much of a big deal considering I wanted the collection for the episodes themselves. IMO, this really is the best western TV series ever aired. But the audio quality is really a disappointment. Still, you have to have this collection, and you shouldn't wait around for Encore Westerns to show it.

Armstrong, John Carradine, Mike Connors, Angie Dickinson, June Lockhart, Jack Lord, Strother Martin, Victor McLaglen, Warren Oates ~ with digital clarity and sound to boot, this has the makings of a winner.Hats off to CBS and Paramount Pictures for sharing this entire first season that ran five seasons ~ this is when good drama with a Western flavor rode the trails and things were good ~ Richard Boone took this role very seriously and it showed ~ if you're into good stories, fine actors and plenty of action, this one is for you ~ so wire Paladin and have his gun travel with you for your next purchase of an outstanding collection...gotta love it!Total Time: 6-DVD-Set ~ Paramount Home Viedo 87523 ~ (5/11/2004)",5,&quot;CBS/Paramount Pictures/Richard Boone/Paladin&quot;,1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,1944,"['Paramount', 'Home', 'Video', 'quot', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'quot', 'featuring', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'role', 'was', 'meant', 'play', 'quot', 'Paladin', 'quot', 'first', 'episode', '1957', 'made', 'mark', 'ratings', 'number', 'three', 'spot', '~', 'hired', 'gun', 'expertise', 'six-shooter', 'commanded', 'fairness', 'understanding', 'situation', 'always', 'made', 'exciting', 'adventurous', 'story', '~', 'not', 'mention', 'Kam', 'Tong', 'Hey', 'Boy', 'who', 'worked', 'hotel', 'gave', 'Paladin', 'newspapers', 'day', 'next', 'assignment.Almost', 'very', 'beginning', 'man', 'black', 'who', 'always', 'gave', 'out', 'famous', 'calling', 'card', 'quot', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'quot', 'wire', 'Paladin', 'San', 'Francisco', 'invitation', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'when', 'were', 'trouble', 'edge', 'catastrophe', '~', 'opening', 'theme', 'was', 'composed', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'who', 'humble', 'opinion', 'gave', 'series', 'much', 'credibility', 'haunting', 'music', 'meant', 'Paladin', 'was', 'ready', 'action', 'had', 'just', 'handed', 'someone', 'famous', 'card.Some', 'best', 'business', 'was', 'stable', 'CBS', 'winner', '~', 'Andrew', 'V.', 'McLaglen', 'director', 'Gene', 'Roddenbury', 'writer', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'writer', 'starring', 'well', 'known', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'R.G', 'Armstrong', 'John', 'Carradine', 'Mike', 'Connors', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'Warren', '~', 'digital', 'clarity', 'sound', 'boot', 'makings', 'winner.Hats', 'CBS', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'sharing', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'ran', 'five', 'seasons', '~', 'when', 'good', 'drama', 'Western', 'flavor', 'rode', 'trails', 'things', 'were', 'good', '~', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'took', 'role', 'very', 'seriously', 'showed', '~', ""'re"", 'good', 'stories', 'fine', 'actors', 'plenty', 'action', 'one', '~', 'so', 'wire', 'Paladin', 'have', 'gun', 'travel', 'next', 'purchase', 'outstanding', 'collection', 'got', 'ta', 'Total', 'Time', '6-DVD-Set', '~', 'Paramount', 'Home', 'Viedo', '87523', '~', '5/11/2004']",N/A

Even then, I enjoyed it's attention to historical detail and its witty style.  Richard Boone was an anomaly among the pretty boys (Tab Hunter/Rock Hudson look-alikes) of the period.  He displayed both acting talent and charisma -- things in short supply during the Happy Days era.Of all the Fifties Westerns, this is the only one I wanted on DVD -- if you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat! I even purchased the DVD compilations released by Columbia House (4 episodes per DVD) for a price of around $4.00 per show.  This release offers the entire first season for a quarter of the price and with wonderful packaging.  I was very disappointed with the Columbia House pencil-sketch covers (ugly) and very relieved to see that this release was done with all the class befitting this wonderful series.Rush out and order them.  If you're a Western fan, you won't be disappointed.

But people unfamiliar with Richard Boone's remarkable portrayal of Paladin, and the half hour program that showcased it, would very likely be surprised at what a superlative show 'Have Gun- Will Travel' really is.These are tight, streamlined tales- examples of a storytelling style that cannot be found in any modern TV show.  The plots charge ahead, yet manage to deliver atmosphere, characterization, and plot twists within their half-hour time frame.  Paladin is larger than life: brave, confident, thoughtful, moody, and very dangerous.  And Boone plays this hero of almost mythic stature without irony or self consciousness.In short this DVD collection will provide many hours of enjoyment to anyone who loves a well-told story, or who wants to see a fine actor bring a legend to life.

808768,A1KXLMA9ZD2G12,B0001JXQ2Y,MaineGirl,"[15, 16]","Have Gun Will Travel, the hit series airing from 1957 to 1963, was  the creation of two innovative ex-radio writers, who had been tipped that CBS was in the market for a cowboy show with a ""different twist."" The result was a truly adult TV western, which chronicled the exploits of a West Point educated solider of fortune known simply as Paladin. Historically the term ""paladin"" is associated with the medieval knights of Charlemagne's court, who were often called upon to travel the country and resolve issues between the king's subjects. Indeed, the TV paladin is a complex combination of knight errant and resourceful gunslinger, who upon payment of $1,000 will leave his well-appointed suite in San Francisco's Hotel Carlton to pursue whatever mission a well-heeled client commissions. A gourmet, an opera buff, and a connoisseur of fine wine, women, and Ming Dynasty artifacts, Paladin can quote Keats, Shelley, and Shakespeare with the same self-assurance that he brings to defeating frontier villains.The character of Paladin is played with sharp intelligence and dry wit by talented actor Richard Boone. Boone's intimidating growl, prominent nose, and pock-marked visage physically distinguished him from the typical pretty-boy hero, just as his character's cultured background distinguished him from more rustic inhabitants of the1870s Old West. Dressed all in black and sporting a waxed mustache, his holster embossed with a silver chess knight, Paladin routinely hands out his signature calling card--an image of a white knight chess piece with the inscription ""Have Gun, Will Travel . . . Wire Paladin, San Francisco."" The charisma and sophistication of his character brought Boone more loyal female fan mail than many of his more photogenic cowboy contemporaries received.The thirty-minute episodes spanning five seasons of Have Gun Will Travel were immensely popular, and the individualistic take on the traditional western format made an international star of its talented lead actor. All in all, it was a well-written show, moral without being preachy. Paladin often solved problems with his wits and powers of negotiation rather than his gun. He was respectful toward women and ethnic groups and spoke any language the plots called for. Yes, the show is dated in it's view of the proper place of women, and not every episode is top-notch, but in general the writing is good, particularly within the confines of a half-hour drama format. You will encounter a number of guest actors, such as Jack Lord (Hawaii 5-O), Charles Bronson, DeForest Kelley (Star Trek), and  June Lockhart, who would later become prominent television stars. Recommended for anyone who likes period westerns or has the urge to re-visit television's Golden Years.",4,A Western With a Different Twist,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,2752,"['Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'hit', 'series', 'airing', '1957', '1963', 'was', 'creation', 'two', 'innovative', 'ex-radio', 'writers', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'tipped', 'CBS', 'was', 'market', 'cowboy', 'show', 'different', 'twist', 'result', 'was', 'truly', 'adult', 'TV', 'western', 'chronicled', 'exploits', 'West', 'Point', 'educated', 'solider', 'fortune', 'known', 'simply', 'Paladin', 'Historically', 'term', 'paladin', 'associated', 'medieval', 'knights', 'Charlemagne', 'court', 'who', 'were', 'often', 'called', 'upon', 'travel', 'country', 'resolve', 'issues', 'king', 'subjects', 'Indeed', 'TV', 'paladin', 'complex', 'combination', 'knight', 'errant', 'resourceful', 'gunslinger', 'who', 'payment', '1,000', 'will', 'leave', 'well-appointed', 'suite', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Hotel', 'Carlton', 'pursue', 'mission', 'well-heeled', 'client', 'commissions', 'gourmet', 'opera', 'buff', 'connoisseur', 'fine', 'wine', 'women', 'Ming', 'Dynasty', 'artifacts', 'Paladin', 'can', 'quote', 'Keats', 'Shelley', 'Shakespeare', 'same', 'self-assurance', 'defeating', 'frontier', 'villains.The', 'character', 'Paladin', 'played', 'sharp', 'intelligence', 'dry', 'wit', 'talented', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'Boone', 'intimidating', 'growl', 'prominent', 'nose', 'pock-marked', 'visage', 'physically', 'distinguished', 'typical', 'pretty-boy', 'hero', 'just', 'character', 'cultured', 'background', 'distinguished', 'more', 'rustic', 'inhabitants', 'the1870s', 'Old', 'West', 'Dressed', 'black', 'sporting', 'waxed', 'mustache', 'holster', 'embossed', 'silver', 'chess', 'knight', 'Paladin', 'routinely', 'out', 'signature', 'calling', 'card', 'image', 'white', 'knight', 'chess', 'piece', 'inscription', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'Wire', 'Paladin', 'San', 'Francisco', 'charisma', 'sophistication', 'character', 'brought', 'Boone', 'more', 'loyal', 'female', 'fan', 'mail', 'many', 'more', 'photogenic', 'cowboy', 'contemporaries', 'received.The', 'thirty-minute', 'episodes', 'spanning', 'five', 'seasons', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'were', 'immensely', 'popular', 'individualistic', 'take', 'traditional', 'western', 'format', 'made', 'international', 'star', 'talented', 'lead', 'actor', 'was', 'well-written', 'show', 'moral', 'being', 'preachy', 'Paladin', 'often', 'solved', 'problems', 'wits', 'powers', 'negotiation', 'rather', 'gun', 'was', 'respectful', 'women', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'spoke', 'language', 'plots', 'called', 'Yes', 'show', 'dated', 'view', 'proper', 'place', 'women', 'not', 'episode', 'top-notch', 'general', 'writing', 'good', 'particularly', 'confines', 'half-hour', 'drama', 'format', 'will', 'encounter', 'number', 'guest', 'actors', 'such', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Hawaii', '5-O', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'DeForest', 'Kelley', 'Star', 'Trek', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'prominent', 'television', 'stars', 'Recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'period', 'westerns', 'urge', 're-visit', 'television', 'Golden', 'Years']",N/A

Broadcast over the Columbia Broadcasting System for six seasons, Richard Boone played the role of Paladin - rather, he created the role of Paladin and explored human falicies with intriguing plots.  The first season, explored in this gift set, offers some of the series's finer episodes including &quot;The Outlaw&quot; with Charles Bronson, the tear-jerking Christmas episode &quot;The Hanging Cross,&quot; and shocking &quot;Return of Dr. Thackeray,&quot; and the fun-filled &quot;The O'Hare Story.&quot;  The most notable is &quot;Hey Boy's Revenge&quot; exploring prejudice between white man and Chinese.  A few years ago TV Guide took a poll to find out what viewers considered the 100 greatest episodes of any TV series.  &quot;Hey Boy's Revenge&quot; was on that list!  If you are going to buy this set (which I highly recommend), I also recommend the fact-filled book, &quot;The Have Gun - Will Travel Companion&quot; by Martin Grams, Jr. and Les Rayburn, also available on Amazon.com, giving insight to the episodes.  Regrettably, the info booklet included with this set gives nothing along the lines of trivia or background info, but the &quot;Have Gun Will Travel Companion&quot; does (including giving a piece of trivia about the theme song composer/singer making a cameo in a first season episode - won't spoil the fun, watch and read for yourself).

808772,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,B0001JXQ2Y,M. Dog,"[4, 4]","This series has really crossed over into true Americana. From the beginning it was kissed by the fates and had a very popular five year run, ending only when the Western genre itself had worn out its welcome with television audiences in the mid sixties.What made it so immediately popular, and why is its appeal so timeless?Well, for starters it was based on a genius premise: A sophisticated, cultured mystery man has based himself in the well-appointed Hotel Carlton in San Francisco just after the Civil War.  He spends his days smoking fine cigars and reading several out-of-town newspapers in the hotel lobby, and his nights are spent in high-stake poker games (always between gentlemen) or escorting San Francisco's most beautiful women to the San Francisco Opera House (in fact his romantic involvements have forced him on more than one occasion to accept out of town work rather hastily). He can quote Shakespeare or Milton easily and with obvious pleasure, or explain a complex piece of history to demonstrate the sad glory and weakness resident in all men. He is patient and tolerant with all, close to none. He is also more than a little mysterious. It is said he is a war hero and a graduate of West Point, but no one seems to know for sure. He is only known by the name Paladin, and no one ever, during all the years the series ran, called him anything else (Paladin, by the way, is defined in Webster's Ninth as: ""1: a champion of a medieval prince 2: an outstanding protagonist of a cause"").Occasionally he will come upon a disturbing bit of news in his newspaper readings. He immediately calls for his Chinese manservant (who is in fact employed by the Carlton but seems nearly always at his beck and call) to post a letter for him immediately, offering his services. The letter will contain only one thing - a business card with a chess piece in the center, the knight, and the words ""Have Gun - Will Travel. Wire Paladin - San Francisco."" If the party in question can afford his high price, they can hire his gun to solve their problems.Second in the list of reasons explaining the shows success: it was packed with heavyweights. Gene Roddenbery and Sam Peckenpah were regular writers. Andrew V. McLaglen directed the first season and Bernard Herman wrote the score (in every episode the famous business card is flashed once, always filling the screen, accompanied by a dramatic snatch of Herman score. Every fan of the series could feel the moment coming in their gut).  Charles Bronson, Strother Martin, Harry Carry Jr., Warren Oates, and many other future and legendary stars were either cutting their teeth or making honorary appearances throughout the series. Really, they don't call it the Golden Age of Television for nothing.And finally, the most significant reason for the series' success: Richard Boone. If ever an actor filled a role more perfectly, I haven't seen it. The actor's large boned, creviced face defines the series. He filled the role with the dignity and authority of deposed royalty, whether he was ordering vintage wine in the cosmopolitan Hotel Carlton or dressed in black, walking into an unfriendly frontier saloon. Boone could draw and level his Colt Single Action Army .45 and quote Euripides in a smooth baritone, making the moment look as natural as Sunday morning. He could handle anything, and he was an easy man to believe in completely. What more needs to be said? Few television heroes wore their crowns with such ease.My favorite moment from season one? Episode 33 ""The Silver Queen."" Paladin has knocked a man to the ground. The man draws his gun, only to find himself staring up into the barrel of Paladin's Colt. A grin develops on Paladins' face, which turns into a warm, nearly friendly chuckle. ""Oh my,"" says Paladin, faced yet again with man's eternal folly, ""you are slow."" It is a supreme moment of ease and grace, tinged with pity and affection.This series is a treasure. -Mykal Banta",5,Deposed Royalty in Black,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,3951,"['series', 'really', 'crossed', 'over', 'true', 'Americana', 'beginning', 'was', 'kissed', 'fates', 'had', 'very', 'popular', 'five', 'year', 'run', 'ending', 'only', 'when', 'Western', 'genre', 'had', 'worn', 'out', 'welcome', 'television', 'audiences', 'mid', 'sixties.What', 'made', 'so', 'immediately', 'popular', 'why', 'appeal', 'so', 'timeless', 'Well', 'starters', 'was', 'based', 'genius', 'premise', 'sophisticated', 'cultured', 'mystery', 'man', 'based', 'well-appointed', 'Hotel', 'Carlton', 'San', 'Francisco', 'just', 'Civil', 'War', 'days', 'smoking', 'fine', 'cigars', 'reading', 'several', 'out-of-town', 'newspapers', 'hotel', 'lobby', 'nights', 'are', 'spent', 'high-stake', 'poker', 'games', 'always', 'gentlemen', 'escorting', 'San', 'Francisco', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Opera', 'House', 'fact', 'romantic', 'involvements', 'have', 'forced', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'accept', 'town', 'work', 'rather', 'hastily', 'can', 'quote', 'Shakespeare', 'Milton', 'easily', 'obvious', 'pleasure', 'explain', 'complex', 'piece', 'history', 'demonstrate', 'sad', 'glory', 'weakness', 'resident', 'men', 'patient', 'tolerant', 'close', 'none', 'also', 'more', 'little', 'mysterious', 'said', 'war', 'hero', 'graduate', 'West', 'Point', 'one', 'know', 'sure', 'only', 'known', 'name', 'Paladin', 'one', 'ever', 'years', 'series', 'ran', 'called', 'anything', 'else', 'Paladin', 'way', 'defined', 'Webster', 'Ninth', '1', 'champion', 'medieval', 'prince', '2', 'outstanding', 'protagonist', 'cause', '.Occasionally', 'will', 'come', 'disturbing', 'bit', 'news', 'newspaper', 'readings', 'immediately', 'Chinese', 'manservant', 'who', 'fact', 'employed', 'Carlton', 'nearly', 'always', 'beck', 'call', 'post', 'letter', 'immediately', 'offering', 'services', 'letter', 'will', 'contain', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'business', 'card', 'chess', 'piece', 'center', 'knight', 'words', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'Wire', 'Paladin', 'San', 'Francisco', 'party', 'question', 'can', 'afford', 'high', 'price', 'can', 'hire', 'gun', 'solve', 'problems.Second', 'list', 'reasons', 'explaining', 'shows', 'success', 'was', 'packed', 'heavyweights', 'Gene', 'Roddenbery', 'Sam', 'Peckenpah', 'were', 'regular', 'writers', 'Andrew', 'V.', 'McLaglen', 'directed', 'first', 'season', 'Bernard', 'Herman', 'wrote', 'score', 'episode', 'famous', 'business', 'card', 'flashed', 'once', 'always', 'filling', 'screen', 'accompanied', 'dramatic', 'snatch', 'Herman', 'score', 'fan', 'series', 'could', 'feel', 'moment', 'coming', 'gut', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Harry', 'Carry', 'Jr.', 'Warren', 'Oates', 'many', 'other', 'future', 'legendary', 'stars', 'were', 'either', 'cutting', 'teeth', 'making', 'honorary', 'appearances', 'series', 'Really', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Television', 'nothing.And', 'finally', 'most', 'significant', 'reason', 'series', 'success', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'ever', 'actor', 'filled', 'role', 'more', 'perfectly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'actor', 'large', 'boned', 'creviced', 'face', 'series', 'filled', 'role', 'dignity', 'authority', 'deposed', 'royalty', 'was', 'ordering', 'vintage', 'wine', 'cosmopolitan', 'Hotel', 'Carlton', 'dressed', 'black', 'walking', 'unfriendly', 'frontier', 'saloon', 'Boone', 'could', 'draw', 'level', 'Colt', 'Single', 'Action', 'Army', '.45', 'quote', 'Euripides', 'smooth', 'baritone', 'making', 'moment', 'look', 'as', 'natural', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'could', 'handle', 'anything', 'was', 'easy', 'man', 'believe', 'completely', 'What', 'more', 'needs', 'be', 'said', 'Few', 'television', 'heroes', 'wore', 'crowns', 'such', 'ease.My', 'favorite', 'moment', 'season', 'one', 'Episode', '33', 'Silver', 'Queen', 'Paladin', 'knocked', 'man', 'ground', 'man', 'gun', 'only', 'find', 'staring', 'up', 'barrel', 'Paladin', 'Colt', 'A', 'grin', 'develops', 'Paladins', 'face', 'warm', 'nearly', 'friendly', 'chuckle', 'Oh', 'Paladin', 'faced', 'yet', 'again', 'man', 'eternal', 'folly', 'are', 'slow', 'supreme', 'moment', 'ease', 'grace', 'tinged', 'pity', 'affection.This', 'series', 'treasure', '-Mykal', 'Banta']",N/A

I showed my 11 year old daughter the show, and she became an instant fan. My wife, who hates westerns, loved it after one episode. My wife, like Paladin, has no tolerance for stupid people, stereotypes and ignorance in general. I can honestly say, that I think anyone would like this show, regardless of age. You can always get a few one liners out of every show. IMHO, they just don't write TV this good anymore.

Each had its own gimmick, and the one here is that a fast gun for hire is a knight errant ""without armor in a savage land.""The episodes often began in a posh San Francisco hotel with ""Paladin"" dressed suavely, reading a newspaper, giving instructions to a Chinese lad, ""Hey Boy,"" and smoking a cheroot.  Soon the knight would be off on another adventure, saving a lass, or whatever.  He was strictly a man of honor who only shot those who deserved to be shot.It isn't perfect.  The opening, with Paladin drawing his six gun, is a bit wearing.  For one thing his leather holster and its stitching is shiny new, not the equipment of a veteran gunslinger.  Then one must accept the fact that Paladin has calling cards and hands one to a client in every episode.  That also gets a little old.  As for realizm, well, the people and towns are too clean (smooth sand streets, no horse manure anywhere), the hats are wrong (too clean, too neatly creased,) etc.  In that respect, this is standard western fare.The black and white photography is great.  Richard Boone was no pretty boy.  He looks rough and is.  The dialogue is fine, and most of the acting is good as well.  For the most part, Boone is convincing.

808792,AK61LQI92GTCH,B0001JXQ2Y,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[157, 161]","Richard Boone stars as Paladin in this six-disk dvd set of the first season of HAVE GUN, WILL TRAVEL (1957-1958).CBS broadcast an incredible thirty-nine episodes that first season, each episode lasting 23 to 25 minutes.  Most episodes begin with the spiffily dressed Paladin (we're never given a last name) scouring the thick stacks newspapers brought to him by the ever helpful Hey Boy (Kam Tong), bellboy at Paladin's residence, the Carlton Hotel in San Francisco.  Eventually Paladin reads of a missing child in Colorado, or a rash of robberies occurring in Montana. Paladin slips his business card - a chess knight with the legend Have Gun, Will Travel, Wire Paladin, San Francisco - into an envelope and mails it to the injured party.Slowly enough as we wend our way through the first year we learn something of Paladin.  He has a passion for justice and a taste for the good things.  His going rate is $1000, although he will take on a pro bono job if the cause is just.  In town he dresses to the nines and in sundry other ways consumes conspicuously.  When traveling with a gun he dresses in black.  Somewhere along the line he picked up a military education, quotes Shakespeare and Pliny, savors a first-edition of Dryden.  His taste in and knowledge of fine wines is commented upon in a couple of episodes....I don't know if any of this matters, but going through fifteen hours of HGWT over a week or so it's kind of fun to have an aha moment or two.  Paladin is an enigma, and Boone, a little more credible as the gunslinger than the city dandy, was an inspired choice to play him.  Boone has a commanding presence and, believe me when I tell you buckaroos, was pretty darn quick on the draw.Twenty-three minutes is a pretty tight box to fit a action story in, which might explain why we don't waste a whole lot of time on Paladin's backstory.  Of course, the storytelling is made a lot easier when you consider the talent involved.  The talent rundown has to start with Boone, who was nominated Best Leading Actor as Paladin in 1959 and 1960.  The great majority of the first season episodes were directed by action veteran Andrew McLaglen (son of actor Victor McLaglen), although a couple were helmed by Oscar winning director Lewis Milestone.  Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry wrote a few scripts for the first season as well.  Sam Peckingpah even co-wrote one episode (The Singer).The talent in front of the camera was as formidable as that behind.  Major established stars like Victor McLaglen and John Carradine appeared in episodes - weak ones, in my opinion, especially the McLaglen episode (directed by son Andrew) in which the old actor played a construction foreman threatening to cut a town off from its source of water.  McLaglen simply wasn't getting around very briskly and it's a little painful to watch.  Another major movie star fares much better.  Charles Bronson wasn't established yet, but he plays a robber who more or less forces Paladin into a gunfighting showdown in an episode that paints fatal violence as both regrettable and, sometimes, unavoidable.  Strother Martin (Cool Hand Luke) appears in two episodes, once as an unscrupulous frontier lawyer and earlier in a more affecting role as a high wire walker who'd lost his nerve somewhere along the way.  Warren Oates plays one of the bad offspring in a truncated take on King Lear.That's just the beginning.  Future television stars appear in almost every episode. Pernell Roberts and Dan Blocker (Bonanza) appear as scruffy tough guys in relatively small roles in separate episodes.  Jack Lord (Hawaii 5-0) is a cowardly kidnapper.  June Lockhart (Lassie, Lost In Space) appears twice as a frontier doctor.  Angie Dickinson (Police Woman) plays a young woman whose brother was murdered and threatens to incite a lynch mob.  Mike Connors (Mannix) plays a cattle rustling bad guy in one of the early episodes.Okay, I'm enthusing here. Still haven't got to the best stuff.  What gave me the biggest kick was watching the people I'd never heard of.  Peter Whitney, who the intro blurb that precedes each episode tells us made a film career out of playing slow-witted big guys and menacing big guys, plays a mentally challenged ranch hand who's goaded into placing a burr under boss's Stuart Whitman's saddle, with dire consequences, in ""The Last Laugh.""  The diminutive B-western star Bob Steele plays a crooked mine boss in ""The High Graders"" - the Wire Paladin blurb tells us Steele had developed a quick draw during his B-career, which McLaglen pays homage to in a draw down between his character and Paladin.  My favorite discovery, though, has to be Marian Seldes, a tremendous actress who is featured in two episodes.  First as a mail order bride who Paladin escorts to her new home in ""The Bride"" and later as a small town teacher who the local bullies try to intimidate in ""The Teacher.""Very strongly recommended, especially for fans of traditional westerns.",5,A knight without armor in a savage land,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,4956,"['Richard', 'Boone', 'Paladin', 'six-disk', 'dvd', 'set', 'first', 'season',

808796,A3NFT0DBLKFYST,B0001JXQ2Y,"Tim R. Niles ""Nomad""","[45, 46]","This will be a review by someone who purchased ALL the Columbia House VHS videotapes of ""Have Gun Will Travel"" (as well as ALL the available ""Maverick"" and the half hour ""Gunsmoke"" VHS tapes) as soon as they were available, from 1995 to 1998. The price for four episodes of the half hour series was about $25 (about $5 for shipping.) If you do the math, these DVDs are a fantastic savings AND offer the added bonus of being easier to store and probably to use.The quality of the VHS tapes was crystalline, which is probably why the DVDs have been reviewed favorably in the technical sense. Much of the filming for ""HGWT"" was done on location in what seems to be pristine wilderness areas, and this clarity of viewing - the extra effort to get the locations done by the production staff and the effort required by the actors involved - is beautiful to watch as well. Most episodes start out in the SF hotel and then lead Paladin far afield on his missions.+It is true that the Gene Roddenberry episodes are very special. Even in the 90s, when a script - and the way that the actors presented it - awed me, it was almost certainly a Roddenberry episode. Truly, eye opening. You understand why ""Star Trek"" has been around forever.Like many children of the 50s, Westerns were the 'meat and potatoes' of my TV experience, and while I liked the shows like ""Maverick"" and ""HGWT"" at that age, but to be able to view them as an adult is amazing. I would also recommend the same for the half hour ""Gunsmoke"" episodes. Clearly, these series went far beyond the standard shoot 'em ups and good guys versus bad guys plotting of production line Westerns. There were a lot of adult level references within the programming and it makes re-viewing later in life even more entertaining, and, leaves a powerful positive impression of all involved.I would suggest also that the first few years of the ""HGWT"" series are the best. In the 50s, there were a lot of episodes being filmed every season, so at least the first three seasons are mainly outstanding.Cannot say enough about the acting skills of Richard Boone: FANTASTIC! He brought that character to life as a multi-dimensional human being.I would definitely recommend the three series mentioned above.

808802,A3KYE9EB8J0S6Y,B0001JXQ2Y,"Writerdana ""Dana""","[13, 14]","Have Gun Will Travel is one of the most remarkable series from television's so-called ""Golden Age"".  It boasts actors who can act (Richard Boone stands out on anyone's list), writers who can write (including Sterling Silliphant and Gene Roddenberry), and both characters and stories that remain three-dimensional even almost 50 years later.  Very few of the characters are all good or all bad (except Paladin, of course).  Even the villains are human beings.  And the concept of a Renaissance man as professional gunfighter is inspired.  The fact that he remains an enigma through most of the series is a bonus.Guest stars on this series read like a ""Who's Who"" of Hollywood in that era and later.  Mike Conners (""Mannix""), Angie Dickinson (""Police Woman""), June Lockhart (""Lassie"" and ""Lost in Space""), Jack Lord (""Hawaii Five-O""), Harold J. Stone (myriads of character parts in TV and the movies), and others far too numerous to mention show up.But Have Gun Will Travel is also a history lesson.  It is a sincere picture of the time in which it takes place.  The show, while always entertaining, deals with some weighty issues.  Many episodes deal with sexual inequality and racial relations.  One episode deals explicitly with the despicable treatment of the Chinese laborers by the railroad owners.  And they all try to capture the feeling of the time -- after the Civil War, when people were trying to make lives for themselves in the West, often under difficult conditions.As with most DVD collections, the episodes are UNCUT.  They play very differently when they are allowed those extra few minutes to round out characters and plot.One more note.  Season One consists of 39 episodes, as many series did at that time -- a far cry from the 24 (if you're lucky) that you get today.  And the price is a bargain.Get this one to see Golden Age television at its very finest.",5,A classic's classic,1084406400,"05 13, 2004",2004,1876,"['Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'series', 'television', 'so-called', 'Golden', 'Age', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'out', 'anyone', 'list', 'writers', 'who', 'can', 'write', 'including', 'Sterling', 'Silliphant', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'characters', 'stories', 'remain', 'three-dimensional', 'even', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'later', 'Very', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'Paladin', 'course', 'Even', 'villains', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'concept', 'Renaissance', 'man', 'professional', 'gunfighter', 'inspired', 'fact', 'enigma', 'most', 'series', 'bonus.Guest', 'stars', 'series', 'read', 'Who', 'Who', 'Hollywood', 'era', 'later', 'Mike', 'Conners', 'Mannix', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'Police', 'Woman', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'Lassie', 'Lost', 'Space', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'Harold', 'J', 'Stone', 'myriads', 'character', 'parts', 'TV', 'movies', 'others', 'far', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'show', 'up.But', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'also', 'history', 'lesson', 'sincere', 'picture', 'time', 'place', 'show', 'always', 'entertaining', 'deals', 'weighty', 'issues', 'Many', 'episodes', 'deal', 'sexual', 'inequality', 'racial', 'relations', 'One', 'episode', 'deals', 'explicitly', 'despicable', 'treatment', 'Chinese', 'laborers', 'railroad', 'owners', 'try', 'capture', 'feeling', 'time', 'Civil', 'War', 'when', 'people', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'lives', 'West', 'often', 'difficult', 'conditions.As', 'most', 'DVD', 'collections', 'episodes', 'are', 'UNCUT', 'play', 'very', 'differently', 'when', 'are', 'allowed', 'extra', 'few', 'minutes', 'round', 'out', 'characters', 'plot.One', 'more', 'note', 'Season', 'One', '39', 'episodes', 'many', 'series', 'did', 'time', 'far', 'cry', '24', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'get', 'today', 'price', 'bargain.Get', 'one', 'see', 'Golden', 'Age', 'television', 'very', 'finest']",N/A
