The writing is awful, but I still like it because I like the topic.There are some good lines in it though, I like Sabrina Carpenter's short seen and there are several other funny scenes in the movie.",4,"call me biased, but I like video game flicks",1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,257,"['want', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'guess', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'writing', 'awful', 'still', 'like', 'are', 'good', 'lines', 'like', 'Sabrina', 'Carpenter', 'short', 'seen', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie']",Noobz

The funniest scenes are actually cameos courtesy of Lin Shaye, Mindy Sterling, and Casper Van Dien.

Save yourself the headache and watch it on Netflix instead. After 5 minutes you'll see what I'm talking about.

As soon as the movie gets going you see shameless plugs for Microsoft and Gears of War 3. This may as well have been a long commercial for the game and Xbox 360. I could have overlooked all that but this movie simply was terrible. This comedy failed to make me laugh much and left me disgusted after the ending. Believe me, you will want to punch out the lead character after you watch this movie. In fact, you will want to punch the actor behind the character for making such a terrible movie. This one has to be as bad as Jay and Silent Bob.",1,Terrible Movie & a Shameless Plug For Microsoft,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,585,"['watched', 'game', 'being', 'gamer', 'As', 'soon', 'movie', 'going', 'see', 'shameless', 'plugs', 'Microsoft', 'Gears', 'War', '3', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'commercial', 'game', '360', 'could', 'have', 'overlooked', 'movie', 'simply', 'was', 'terrible', 'comedy', 'failed', 'make', 'laugh', 'much', 'left', 'disgusted', 'ending', 'Believe', 'will', 'want', 'punch', 'out', 'lead', 'character', 'watch', 'movie', 'fact', 'will', 'want', 'punch', 'actor', 'character', 'making', 'such', 'terrible', 'movie', 'one', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob']",Noobz
