Potty Power attempts to speed up the process by presenting a DVD that encourages kids to use the potty and give up their diapers or pull- ups for good. It accomplishes it goal through its potty talk, songs, skit, and upbeat attitude about using the potty. Jessica, the Potty Power narrator, is encouraging and extremely perky. She talks about pee and poop, slang terms for bodily functions, and more while managing to keep a smile on her face throughout. She really wants children to learn to use the potty, and her enthusiasm, hopefully, will carry through to the children who watch the DVD.This DVD certainly has its usefulness and I know many people who have had great success showing this training session to their young toddlers. But it does get a little corny and many adults will roll their eyes as they listen to the dialogue and the songs. Songs like I'm Proud to Wear my Underwear, Wipe Your Bottom and others are certainly catchy to young children, but even some youngsters will find the material too silly to be true. One of my toddlers is already toilet trained and she laughs aloud when she watches this DVD, due to its silly and often corny style.Silliness aside, what matters most is the effectiveness of the DVD and from my experience, Potty Power has made a difference. My youngest one likes to repeat the lines she has heard from this DVD and she likes to sing along to the tunes. She has been going on her own, to the potty, so the DVD does seem to be having a positive effect, even if it does get annoying at times.Potty Power, in spite of its silliness, is an effective means to wean children off their diapers and pull- ups. If you can get past the goofiness of the whole experience, the excessive perkiness of the narrator, and the annoying skit at the end, Potty Power seems to have something going for it. Children will remember the tunes and message, making this DVD a good toilet- training supplement.",4,"Potty Power is Silly, but it Works",1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,2079,"['Toilet', 'training', 'part', 'parenting', 'process', 'usually', 'toddler', 'years', 'can', 'take', 'longer', 'children', 'others', 'Potty', 'Power', 'attempts', 'speed', 'up', 'process', 'presenting', 'DVD', 'kids', 'use', 'potty', 'give', 'up', 'diapers', 'pull-', 'ups', 'good', 'goal', 'potty', 'talk', 'songs', 'skit', 'upbeat', 'attitude', 'using', 'potty', 'Jessica', 'Potty', 'Power', 'narrator', 'encouraging', 'extremely', 'perky', 'pee', 'poop', 'slang', 'terms', 'bodily', 'functions', 'more', 'managing', 'keep', 'smile', 'face', 'really', 'children', 'learn', 'use', 'potty', 'enthusiasm', 'hopefully', 'will', 'carry', 'children', 'who', 'watch', 'DVD.This', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'usefulness', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'success', 'showing', 'training', 'session', 'young', 'toddlers', 'get', 'little', 'corny', 'many', 'adults', 'will', 'roll', 'eyes', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'songs', 'Songs', ""'m"", 'Proud', 'Wear', 'Underwear', 'Wipe', 'Your', 'Bottom', 'others', 'are', 'certainly', 'catchy', 'young', 'children', 'even', 'youngsters', 'will', 'find', 'material', 'too', 'silly', 'be', 'true', 'One', 'toddlers', 'already', 'toilet', 'trained', 'aloud', 'when', 'DVD', 'due', 'silly', 'often', 'corny', 'style.Silliness', 'aside', 'what', 'most', 'effectiveness', 'DVD', 'experience', 'Potty', 'Power', 'made', 'difference', 'youngest', 'one', 'repeat', 'lines', 'heard', 'DVD', 'sing', 'along', 'tunes', 'been', 'going', 'own', 'potty', 'DVD', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'positive', 'effect', 'even', 'get', 'annoying', 'times.Potty', 'Power', 'spite', 'silliness', 'effective', 'means', 'wean', 'children', 'off', 'diapers', 'pull-', 'ups', 'can', 'get', 'goofiness', 'whole', 'experience', 'excessive', 'perkiness', 'narrator', 'annoying', 'skit', 'end', 'Potty', 'Power', 'have', 'something', 'going', 'Children', 'will', 'remember', 'tunes', 'message', 'making', 'DVD', 'good', 'toilet-', 'training', 'supplement']",Potty Power - For Boys & Girls
