1278614,AHF97M45JFCB,B002MXZYFY,ONENEO,"[20, 20]","I reviewed the first collection of Nabari a few months back and though the story was ridiculed for being overly complex and flat emotionally, I found quite a few redeeming aspects to the tale and secretly looked forward to the second (and final) FUNimation release of the series.  I completed it last night and have concluded that love or hate the first release, it may be in your best interest to consider completing the journey.Nabari The Complete Series Part Two comes in at a runtime of 325 minutes and contains 13 episodes (14-26) spanning two discs. The discs come packaged in a pair of thin packs within a cardboard outer slipcase.The show wears an appropriate TV 14 rating due to some slightly adult slanted themes of violence, war, and conflict. There is no nudity, swearing, or gore to report.Language options are typical sub and dub, which means the viewer has the choice of running either the original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround) and the option of displaying English subtitles beneath either dialog choice.Extras include textless songs, a commentary track from some of the English voice talent over Episode 25, and a host of upcoming Funimation anime previews.As you would probably expect, the tale picks up right where the first collection ended and jumps right back into rhythm with very little re-establishing.  If your memory of the first set is hazy, reviewing is probably a requisite.Miharu Rokujou's slow and mysterious rise into the ranks of a secret society is fully cemented this time around with his inability to ever return to a life of normalcy.  Becoming the Ruler of Nabari is no longer an option but rather his only chance for survival.To be completely honest, the second half of the tale is actually much darker than the first.  Some of those midday high school moments that opened the entire saga seem like ages ago!  The plot really becomes no easier to follow this time around but does tend to focus a bit more heavily on the emotional relationships between the characters.  Upon completion of the first 13 episodes, I basically concluded that the tale could take one of two paths to fruition: A dependence upon Ninjitsu combat/ action sequences or a deeper look at the emotions motivating the players involved.  As it turns out, the latter is the path taken and for the most part, it's pretty rewarding.Those who felt the first installation came up feeling flat emotionally may be interested in this collection for its insistence upon revealing each and every character's innermost motivations.  The acting is subdue, just like before, and sometimes so nonchalant that it almost feels ""emotionless"" but the story sets up their personas so thoroughly that the responsibility didn't fall squarely into the laps of the actors themselves.Surprisingly a homosexual angle is solidified by the show's conclusion that may put off some viewers, but the cast commentary over episode 25 does a nice job of offering an explanation into the acting mind set that warrants another viewing.The music, which has been one of the show's greatest strengths, is maintained here with whimsical melodies (especially during each episode's title card) and intense, sweeping scores when the onscreen tension demands it.Visually the show continues to charm with moody atmospheres, dark underground lairs, and well-animated character models.  I've always been partial to the raining Japanese characters as a tool to indicate the use of power- it's reminiscent to the green coding used in The Matrix with a welcomed organic touch.Funimation's English dub is very, very well done although I have to give the edge to the original Japanese vocal work on this one.  In truth your probably best off to view the show in both languages as the experience is quite unique in either incarnation.  The complexity of the plot (and the names involved) may deter some from wanting to go all the way through reading subtitles.In all Nabari is quite a unique property.  Fans expecting an action-filled, Ninja-based hack and slash fest were probably a bit let down with the first collection due to its drab characters and focus on relationships.  In that regard, the second installment carries on this tradition pretty heavily.  However, by the conclusion of the 26 episodes, it's difficult to come away without a greater understanding/ respect for the cast of characters and the unique struggles they've gone through.  And in the end, that is perhaps the greatest mark of a solid piece of anime.",4,"A Darker, Grittier, and Richer Conclusion",1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,4533,"['reviewed', 'first', 'collection', 'Nabari', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'story', 'was', 'ridiculed', 'being', 'overly', 'complex', 'flat', 'emotionally', 'found', 'quite', 'few', 'redeeming', 'aspects', 'tale', 'secretly', 'looked', 'forward', 'second', 'final', 'FUNimation', 'release', 'series', 'completed', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'concluded', 'love', 'hate', 'first', 'release', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'interest', 'consider', 'completing', 'journey.Nabari', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Part', 'Two', 'runtime', '325', 'minutes', '13', 'episodes', '14-26', 'spanning', 'two', 'discs', 'discs', 'come', 'packaged', 'pair', 'thin', 'packs', 'cardboard', 'outer', 'slipcase.The', 'show', 'appropriate', 'TV', '14', 'rating', 'due', 'slightly', 'adult', 'slanted', 'themes', 'violence', 'war', 'conflict', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'gore', 'report.Language', 'options', 'are', 'typical', 'sub', 'dub', 'viewer', 'choice', 'running', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialog', 'track', 'stereo', 'English', 'dub', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'option', 'displaying', 'English', 'subtitles', 'dialog', 'choice.Extras', 'include', 'textless', 'songs', 'commentary', 'track', 'English', 'voice', 'talent', 'Episode', '25', 'host', 'upcoming', 'Funimation', 'anime', 'previews.As', 'would', 'probably', 'expect', 'tale', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'collection', 'ended', 'jumps', 'right', 'back', 'rhythm', 'very', 'little', 're-establishing', 'memory', 'first', 'set', 'hazy', 'reviewing', 'probably', 'requisite.Miharu', 'Rokujou', 'slow', 'mysterious', 'rise', 'ranks', 'secret', 'society', 'fully', 'cemented', 'time', 'around', 'inability', 'ever', 'return', 'life', 'normalcy', 'Becoming', 'Ruler', 'Nabari', 'no', 'longer', 'option', 'rather', 'only', 'chance', 'survival.To', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'second', 'half', 'tale', 'actually', 'much', 'darker', 'first', 'midday', 'high', 'school', 'moments', 'opened', 'entire', 'saga', 'seem', 'ages', 'ago', 'plot', 'really', 'easier', 'follow', 'time', 'around', 'tend', 'focus', 'bit', 'more', 'heavily', 'emotional', 'relationships', 'characters', 'completion', 'first', '13', 'episodes', 'basically', 'concluded', 'tale', 'could', 'take', 'one', 'two', 'paths', 'fruition', 'dependence', 'Ninjitsu', 'combat/', 'action', 'sequences', 'deeper', 'look', 'emotions', 'motivating', 'players', 'involved', 'out', 'latter', 'path', 'taken', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'rewarding.Those', 'who', 'felt', 'first', 'installation', 'came', 'up', 'feeling', 'flat', 'emotionally', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'collection', 'insistence', 'revealing', 'character', 'innermost', 'motivations', 'acting', 'subdue', 'just', 'before', 'sometimes', 'so', 'nonchalant', 'almost', 'emotionless', 'story', 'up', 'personas', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'responsibility', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'squarely', 'laps', 'actors', 'themselves.Surprisingly', 'homosexual', 'angle', 'solidified', 'show', 'conclusion', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'viewers', 'cast', 'commentary', 'episode', '25', 'nice', 'job', 'offering', 'explanation', 'acting', 'mind', 'set', 'warrants', 'viewing.The', 'music', 'been', 'one', 'show', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'maintained', 'here', 'whimsical', 'melodies', 'especially', 'episode', 'title', 'card', 'intense', 'sweeping', 'scores', 'when', 'onscreen', 'tension', 'demands', 'it.Visually', 'show', 'charm', 'moody', 'atmospheres', 'dark', 'underground', 'lairs', 'well-animated', 'character', 'models', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'partial', 'raining', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'tool', 'indicate', 'use', 'power-', 'reminiscent', 'green', 'coding', 'used', 'Matrix', 'welcomed', 'organic', 'touch.Funimation', 'English', 'dub', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'give', 'edge', 'original', 'Japanese', 'vocal', 'work', 'one', 'truth', 'probably', 'best', 'off', 'view', 'show', 'languages', 'experience', 'quite', 'unique', 'incarnation', 'complexity', 'plot', 'names', 'involved', 'may', 'deter', 'wanting', 'go', 'way', 'reading', 'subtitles.In', 'Nabari', 'quite', 'unique', 'property', 'Fans', 'expecting', 'action-filled', 'Ninja-based', 'hack', 'slash', 'fest', 'were', 'probably', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'first', 'collection', 'due', 'drab', 'characters', 'focus', 'relationships', 'regard', 'second', 'installment', 'tradition', 'pretty', 'heavily', 'However', 'conclusion', '26', 'episodes', 'difficult', 'come', 'away', 'greater', 'understanding/', 'respect', 'cast', 'characters', 'unique', 'struggles', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'end', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'mark', 'solid', 'piece', 'anime']","Nabari No Ou: Complete Series, Part 2"

1278616,AV1WAYOHXD1MA,B002MXZYFY,"The Pes ""Deerhoads""","[1, 3]","So here we are at the end.  The lines between 'good' and 'evil' have been erased and the factions that began the series have been blurred.  Miharu and Yoite are now in cahoots with each other, trying to accomplish Yoite's desire to be erased from the face of the earth--memories and all.  Their pact produces some confusion amongst the Banten and Kairoshu ninja clans, as each one of the clans is trying to jock for position to attain Miharu and the power within him.It's a wild goose chase, as Miharu changes hands between the two ninja clans multiple times.  And while this sounds like a lot of action involved, what with all the exchanges that Miharu goes through, in reality it isn't.This, in my opinion, is where the series could have been better.  I understand that a big central theme within the series is the bond between Miharu and Yoite.  Yoite's anguish, his melancholy is the driving force that leads him to kidnap Miharu and get his wishes to use the Shinrabansho.  The fact that Miharu starts to understand Yoite and feel compassion for his cause is a good thing for the plot.  However, I feel the story, specially this part, could had been told in a much more condensed package, which would had delivered a better punch to the ending.There were too many episodes that felt too similar and dealt too much with Yoite's depression.  These episodes felt unnecessary, and just a rehash of that central theme mentioned above.  I get it that Yoite is sad about his past.  I get it that Yoite sees no meaning in his life.  I get it that he just wants to die and be erased from existence.I get it.We spend too much time on this and after a while Yoite's plight starts to lose its impact and starts to sound like whining.  Nobody likes a whiny little boy telling you how sad he feels all the time.  It's a disservice to the plot and it stretches the series ten episodes too long.A much tighter, and truncated show would had worked better in the story telling aspect.  Sixteen episodes would have been sufficient to tell this story and it would have given it more oomph by the last episode.  It doesn't help that the primary characters at the beginning of the show receded too much into the background and didn't play much of a part to the story.  Tabari, Raimei and Kouichi are practically forgotten and only appear useful in the last few episodes.This series could have been a lousy one, but the ending actually makes it worth it.  That bond between Yoite and Miharu actually comes out much better by series end than it does midway through it.  You care at the end that these two people have feelings (romantic or affectionate, you decide) for each other.  That their bond wasn't for naught.  That their actions actually mattered.  It isn't a spectacular ending, and some who wish for a massive end-game battle will have to look elsewhere.  The ending serves its purpose and, I think, gives the show a redeeming value.So what does this mean to you?Well it really comes down to how you felt about the first 13 episodes.  If you made it this far, I think you can get through this last set.  Just be prepared to slush through some heavy-handed melancholy episodes in the middle of it.  Yes, they drag on a little and yes they tend to be overly dramatic, but the ending will satisfy most and there are some cool reveals about some of the supporting character's pasts.  Throw in some descent fight scenes and you have a rewarding set.It might not change your mind about the series, but it does make it an interesting one.  If you didn't like the first half then stay away from this one.Overall, this won't waste your time, just make it interesting.",3,"Good ending to a mediocre, overall series",1270684800,"04 8, 2010",2010,3649,"['So', 'here', 'are', 'end', 'lines', ""'good"", ""'evil"", 'have', 'been', 'erased', 'factions', 'began', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'blurred', 'Miharu', 'Yoite', 'are', 'now', 'cahoots', 'other', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'Yoite', 'desire', 'be', 'erased', 'face', 'earth', 'memories', 'pact', 'confusion', 'Banten', 'Kairoshu', 'ninja', 'one', 'clans', 'trying', 'jock', 'position', 'attain', 'Miharu', 'power', 'him.It', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'Miharu', 'hands', 'two', 'ninja', 'multiple', 'times', 'lot', 'action', 'involved', 'what', 'exchanges', 'Miharu', 'reality', 'opinion', 'where', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'understand', 'big', 'central', 'theme', 'series', 'bond', 'Miharu', 'Yoite', 'Yoite', 'anguish', 'melancholy', 'driving', 'force', 'kidnap', 'Miharu', 'get', 'wishes', 'use', 'Shinrabansho', 'fact', 'Miharu', 'understand', 'Yoite', 'feel', 'compassion', 'cause', 'good', 'thing', 'plot', 'However', 'feel', 'story', 'specially', 'part', 'could', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'much', 'more', 'condensed', 'package', 'would', 'had', 'delivered', 'better', 'punch', 'ending.There', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'felt', 'too', 'similar', 'dealt', 'too', 'much', 'Yoite', 'depression', 'episodes', 'felt', 'unnecessary', 'just', 'rehash', 'central', 'theme', 'mentioned', 'get', 'Yoite', 'sad', 'past', 'get', 'Yoite', 'meaning', 'life', 'get', 'just', 'die', 'be', 'erased', 'existence.I', 'get', 'it.We', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Yoite', 'plight', 'lose', 'impact', 'sound', 'whining', 'Nobody', 'whiny', 'little', 'boy', 'telling', 'how', 'sad', 'time', 'disservice', 'plot', 'series', 'ten', 'too', 'long.A', 'much', 'tighter', 'truncated', 'show', 'would', 'had', 'worked', 'better', 'story', 'telling', 'aspect', 'Sixteen', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sufficient', 'tell', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'oomph', 'last', 'episode', ""n't"", 'help', 'primary', 'characters', 'beginning', 'show', 'receded', 'too', 'much', 'background', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'much', 'part', 'story', 'Tabari', 'Raimei', 'Kouichi', 'are', 'practically', 'forgotten', 'only', 'appear', 'useful', 'last', 'few', 'episodes.This', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lousy', 'one', 'ending', 'actually', 'bond', 'Yoite', 'Miharu', 'actually', 'out', 'much', 'better', 'series', 'end', 'midway', 'care', 'end', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'feelings', 'romantic', 'affectionate', 'decide', 'other', 'bond', 'was', ""n't"", 'naught', 'actions', 'actually', 'mattered', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'ending', 'who', 'wish', 'massive', 'end-game', 'battle', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'ending', 'purpose', 'think', 'show', 'redeeming', 'value.So', 'what', 'mean', 'Well', 'really', 'down', 'how', 'felt', 'first', '13', 'episodes', 'made', 'far', 'think', 'can', 'get', 'last', 'set', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'slush', 'heavy-handed', 'melancholy', 'episodes', 'middle', 'Yes', 'drag', 'little', 'tend', 'be', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'will', 'satisfy', 'most', 'are', 'cool', 'reveals', 'supporting', 'character', 'pasts', 'Throw', 'descent', 'fight', 'scenes', 'have', 'rewarding', 'set.It', 'might', 'not', 'change', 'mind', 'series', 'make', 'interesting', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'half', 'then', 'stay', 'away', 'one.Overall', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'just', 'make', 'interesting']","Nabari No Ou: Complete Series, Part 2"
1278617,A16I1TNBSOLQFG,B002MXZYFY,Tristan A. Hayes,"[1, 1]","Chances are you probably read the first review for Nabari No Ou, or happened to decided to finish off the 1 season anime and are now entering into deciding on continue the series or abandoning it.  My advice for this second is actually quite interesting.The ending of part 1 convinced me to keep going through the 26 episode series and seeing how it would turn out.  The episodes in the teens were actually quite interesting and the same can be said for this part of the season.  The plot had the potential to be fast paced and exciting throughout the episode 20 and beyond but there is so much lost potential.Several mistakes are made.  First off the anime spends so much time on the relationship between Yoite and Miharu that it gets annoying. These are two male characters who have the weirdest friendship, and had I not have already know the background of the manga and the outcome, even the genre, I would be convinced that this was dwelling in the realms of a shonen-ai anime.  It just gets so sappy at times that I spent time surfing the internet while they were talking and such.  Other mistakes were just the pacing, ie, the plot could have been resolved with just 22 episodes instead of dragging it out to 26.  Next, the actual villain and resolution of that plot seemed to in my mind conclude at episode 24. All the action and such and even some resolutions, which is two episodes before being finished.Highlights of the anime include awesome action animations.  I would say that is a huge highlight, fighting is fast paced, brisk, and fluid.  There arent any badly drawn character models that morph into molds in the heat of action or animation that is reminiscent of first time flash animation users. Folks it is all fresh, smooth, and even magical at times.  There is a wide array of ninja took used and even ninjutsu as well.  The fight scenes made the series bearable to watch.There really isnt much more to say other than that the strong background cast was enjoyable to have and it was easy to immediately get acquainted with newcomers to the storyline and even pick out favorites. The opening song was memorable too and I was glad it was chosen (Crawl by Veltpunch).All in all it is still just a decent anime boxset that gets the job done.  There werent any memorable special features, there are english subtitlies for people who want to listen to the Japanese voices, with an acceptable font.  The female voice actor for the main male character was a random choice too and probably weakened many of the moments of action when he screamed like a girl or when angry sounded like a women.  Oh well.2.5 out of 5 stars:  Decent to continue through just to get through the end, outstanding fight scenes.
