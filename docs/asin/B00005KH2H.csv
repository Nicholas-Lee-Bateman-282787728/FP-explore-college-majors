There are plenty of songs/videos I like here; there are also plenty that have the power to make me change the station when they come on.  The really nice surprise, though, was the Jungle Brothers video.  My husband, my brother and I weren't familiar with the song, but we loved the video--it was vastly entertaining.I think most people can find things they like about this collection and things they don't like; I also think we can all agree that getting four decent DVDs for approximately the price of one or two is a pretty good deal.",4,You get your money's worth.,1103587200,"12 21, 2004",2004,660,"['think', 'fairly', 'low', 'price', 'number', 'videos', 'get', 'feelings', 'selection', 'videos', 'are', 'mixed', 'are', 'plenty', 'songs/videos', 'like', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'plenty', 'have', 'power', 'make', 'change', 'station', 'when', 'come', 'really', 'nice', 'surprise', 'was', 'Jungle', 'Brothers', 'video', 'husband', 'brother', 'were', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'song', 'loved', 'video', 'was', 'vastly', 'entertaining.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'find', 'things', 'like', 'collection', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'also', 'think', 'can', 'agree', 'getting', 'four', 'decent', 'DVDs', 'approximately', 'price', 'one', 'two', 'pretty', 'good', 'deal']",MTV20 Collection

Music videos were a great idea for the TV, until MTV made crappy shows, then it went extremly downhill. Now the only shows on MTV that are worthwhile are Pimp My Ride, The Ashlee Simpson Show, and maybe the RR/RW show is aight, but other than that, MTV sucks now considering they play more crappy show like Punk'd, Jack***, and other junk rather than doing what their idea was in the 80's, shows music videos. Anyway, I'm not going to waste my review bashing MTV, I'm going to review the DVD. Well, it's kinda hard to make a DVD of the biggest songs of 1982-2002, and MTV did an ok job on it. Mainly because MTV put on so-so to forgettable videos on the DVD. Some of these videos are also low quality, but, just buy the DVD if you see it for half-price somewhere, but other than that, this DVD is wasting your money.",2,Poor videos choices ruin it,1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,873,"['MTV', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'ideas', 'TV', 'Music', 'videos', 'were', 'great', 'idea', 'TV', 'MTV', 'made', 'crappy', 'shows', 'then', 'went', 'extremly', 'downhill', 'Now', 'only', 'MTV', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'are', 'Pimp', 'My', 'Ride', 'Ashlee', 'Simpson', 'Show', 'maybe', 'RR/RW', 'show', 'aight', 'other', 'MTV', 'now', 'considering', 'play', 'more', 'crappy', 'show', 'Punk', ""'d"", 'Jack***', 'other', 'junk', 'rather', 'doing', 'what', 'idea', 'was', '80', 'music', 'videos', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'waste', 'review', 'bashing', 'MTV', ""'m"", 'going', 'review', 'DVD', 'Well', 'kinda', 'hard', 'make', 'DVD', 'biggest', 'songs', '1982-2002', 'MTV', 'did', 'ok', 'job', 'Mainly', 'MTV', 'put', 'so-so', 'forgettable', 'videos', 'DVD', 'videos', 'are', 'also', 'low', 'quality', 'just', 'buy', 'DVD', 'see', 'half-price', 'somewhere', 'other', 'DVD', 'wasting', 'money']",MTV20 Collection
661944,A3AHPXZ8IQNNKC,B00005KH2H,"S. ""mediaddict""","[22, 25]","Whether or not you should buy this is really determined by your gut reaction to the concept. If the thought of owning some of your favorite videos from years past puts a smile on your face, go buy this immediately. If you hem and haw, or are unsure, pass it up. Unless you can think of a few videos on each disc that you would love to own, you are probably better off just buying your favorite disc, as the bonus DVD is rather sparse.The videos in general are in great quality (the more recent ones look pristine), and the sound quality is fine. The little video interviews are completely forgettable however, and the 'bonus' disc really could have used some more fleshing out.DVD is really the ideal medium for video retrospectives like this because you can skip past the ones you don't like in the blink of an eye. My one beef with the set is that you are left wondering why they didn't fill these discs up a bit more. DVDs can certainly fit more than 15 or so videos per disc, and it gets you to thinking about what deserving bands got snubbed by this retrospective.",3,"Not perfect, but a great way to archive some classic videos",995328000,"07 17, 2001",2001,1069,"['Whether', 'not', 'should', 'buy', 'really', 'determined', 'gut', 'reaction', 'concept', 'thought', 'owning', 'favorite', 'videos', 'years', 'past', 'smile', 'face', 'go', 'buy', 'immediately', 'hem', 'haw', 'are', 'unsure', 'pass', 'up', 'can', 'think', 'few', 'videos', 'disc', 'would', 'love', 'own', 'are', 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'just', 'buying', 'favorite', 'disc', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'rather', 'sparse.The', 'videos', 'general', 'are', 'great', 'quality', 'more', 'recent', 'ones', 'look', 'pristine', 'sound', 'quality', 'fine', 'little', 'video', 'interviews', 'are', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'however', ""'bonus"", 'disc', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'fleshing', 'out.DVD', 'really', 'ideal', 'medium', 'video', 'retrospectives', 'can', 'skip', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'blink', 'eye', 'one', 'beef', 'set', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'fill', 'discs', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'DVDs', 'can', 'certainly', 'fit', 'more', '15', 'so', 'videos', 'disc', 'thinking', 'what', 'deserving', 'bands', 'got', 'snubbed', 'retrospective']",MTV20 Collection
