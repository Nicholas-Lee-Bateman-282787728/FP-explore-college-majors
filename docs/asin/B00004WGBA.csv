555182,A3TOWO3PUY3DGL,B00004WGBA,-Ashi-,"[11, 12]","UPDATE:  December 9, 2012:I finished reading the Hardy novel this excellent BBC mini-series is based on, and I am going to reflect the differences between the original work and this mini-series reviewed here.  The spirit of the novel lives on in this BBC series, much better than the cringe-worthy 1996 remake.  However, I can see the ending was rushed through in the production for whatever the reason.  The tragedy involving the children, at least my impression of the event, was a turning point rather than the climax.  In the novel, the tragedy has only begun and steaming up at that point.  And in Part Six of the novel, the story has no shortage of memorable quotes.  It is in fact, Hardy's tour de force, perhaps that's why it made the bad reception of the novel even more tragic and insulting to the author.  It was precisely Hardy's bluntly put unpleasant truth to people who aren't ready for them that made the novel so much hated during its inception.  After all, why would people, live in an era of distress and gloomy society want to reminded the world is full of flaws and moral hypocrisy.  There are many subjects that are way too ahead of its time and should be included in the mini-series.  I wish there will be a remake that's true to the spirit and much more elaborated.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Like the other reviewer, I finished this two-DVD mini-series in one sitting.  I was also clueless what I was getting, but my passion lasted 'til the very end.It was very difficult to understand at first because of the regional British accent characters were speaking.  It's to provide authenticity of the language spoken by people from that setting.  However, I wished the DVD production company could have provided close captioning for easier watching.Do not let the language issue deter you though, because the story is very rewarding and very timeless, not only for the production value like the other reviewer pointed out, but the story itself transcends the time period it is set (which is Victorian England, early Victorian, I presume).The other reviewer already mentioned something about Jude's marriage life.  I must mention there is another tragedy (a counterpoint) in Jude's life some of us may relate well.  The early focus of the story was on Jude's impotence to fulfill his personal goal.  He wanted to be a scholar at a university.  However, his financial status as well as social status prevented him from achieving it (this was Victorian era where people must know their places).To solve the financial obstacle, he learned a trade and worked as a mason.  However, he still had to meet the obstacle to be admitted to a university.  He was ridiculed as being too educated for his trade.  He felt betrayed by the society.  The upward mobility in Victorian England wasn't very good.  A self-made man was not rewarded.He later wandered through series of vocational changes (I think this is very relatable, given the time we're in).  However, after each new dream shattered before him, he was back as a mason.While he was wading through the river of vocational identity, he also had an emotional journey.  He was a man of tradition value.  His acquaintance to his cousin Sue soon turned into a taboo love affair.  The problem was not they were close kins, but a legal problem.  He was a married man.She also couldn't make up her mind between her own cousin and her betrothed.  Instead, she masked her non-commitment as a break of trivial social convention.  Her free-spiritedness disgusted him at first but at the end of the story, we would see a reversal of values.Sue, on the other hand, after their wedlock children had hung themselves, she believed it was a punishment for her sin.  It led her to re-marry her original husband.  The tragic ending fit the brand of being Thomas Hardy's most controversial work.The story is very melodramatic, which succumbs me once a while as a guilty pleasure (*nervous laughter*).  It also reminds me of Scarlett Letter, except with a male lead.  Jude must face the world's slight opinion of him, both his trade and his value, and bitter end of his own family.It's a very modern story.",4,Jude the Hermit,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,4138,"['UPDATE', 'December', '9', '2012', 'finished', 'reading', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'excellent', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'based', 'am', 'going', 'reflect', 'differences', 'original', 'work', 'mini-series', 'reviewed', 'here', 'spirit', 'novel', 'lives', 'BBC', 'series', 'much', 'better', 'cringe-worthy', '1996', 'remake', 'However', 'can', 'see', 'ending', 'was', 'rushed', 'production', 'whatever', 'reason', 'tragedy', 'involving', 'children', 'least', 'impression', 'event', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'rather', 'climax', 'novel', 'tragedy', 'only', 'begun', 'steaming', 'up', 'point', 'Part', 'Six', 'novel', 'story', 'shortage', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'fact', 'Hardy', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'perhaps', 'why', 'made', 'bad', 'reception', 'novel', 'even', 'more', 'tragic', 'insulting', 'author', 'was', 'precisely', 'Hardy', 'bluntly', 'put', 'unpleasant', 'truth', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'ready', 'made', 'novel', 'so', 'much', 'hated', 'inception', 'why', 'would', 'people', 'live', 'era', 'distress', 'gloomy', 'society', 'want', 'reminded', 'world', 'full', 'flaws', 'moral', 'hypocrisy', 'are', 'many', 'subjects', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'ahead', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'mini-series', 'wish', 'will', 'be', 'remake', 'true', 'spirit', 'much', 'more', 'elaborated.ORIGINAL', 'REVIEW', 'other', 'reviewer', 'finished', 'two-DVD', 'mini-series', 'one', 'sitting', 'was', 'also', 'clueless', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'passion', 'lasted', 'very', 'end.It', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'understand', 'first', 'regional', 'British', 'accent', 'characters', 'were', 'speaking', 'provide', 'authenticity', 'language', 'spoken', 'people', 'setting', 'However', 'wished', 'DVD', 'production', 'company', 'could', 'have', 'provided', 'close', 'captioning', 'easier', 'watching.Do', 'not', 'let', 'language', 'issue', 'deter', 'story', 'very', 'rewarding', 'very', 'timeless', 'not', 'only', 'production', 'value', 'other', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'story', 'time', 'period', 'set', 'Victorian', 'England', 'early', 'Victorian', 'presume', '.The', 'other', 'reviewer', 'already', 'mentioned', 'something', 'Jude', 'marriage', 'life', 'must', 'mention', 'tragedy', 'counterpoint', 'Jude', 'life', 'may', 'relate', 'well', 'early', 'focus', 'story', 'was', 'Jude', 'impotence', 'fulfill', 'personal', 'goal', 'wanted', 'be', 'scholar', 'university', 'However', 'financial', 'status', 'as', 'well', 'social', 'status', 'prevented', 'achieving', 'was', 'Victorian', 'era', 'where', 'people', 'must', 'know', 'places', '.To', 'solve', 'financial', 'obstacle', 'learned', 'trade', 'worked', 'mason', 'However', 'still', 'had', 'meet', 'obstacle', 'be', 'admitted', 'university', 'was', 'ridiculed', 'being', 'too', 'educated', 'trade', 'felt', 'betrayed', 'society', 'upward', 'mobility', 'Victorian', 'England', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'self-made', 'man', 'was', 'not', 'rewarded.He', 'later', 'wandered', 'series', 'vocational', 'changes', 'think', 'very', 'relatable', 'given', 'time', ""'re"", 'However', 'new', 'dream', 'shattered', 'was', 'back', 'mason.While', 'was', 'wading', 'river', 'vocational', 'identity', 'also', 'had', 'emotional', 'journey', 'was', 'man', 'tradition', 'value', 'acquaintance', 'cousin', 'Sue', 'soon', 'turned', 'taboo', 'love', 'affair', 'problem', 'was', 'not', 'were', 'close', 'kins', 'legal', 'problem', 'was', 'married', 'man.She', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'own', 'cousin', 'betrothed', 'Instead', 'masked', 'non-commitment', 'break', 'trivial', 'social', 'convention', 'free-spiritedness', 'disgusted', 'first', 'end', 'story', 'would', 'see', 'reversal', 'values.Sue', 'other', 'hand', 'wedlock', 'children', 'had', 'hung', 'believed', 'was', 'punishment', 'sin', 'led', 're-marry', 'original', 'husband', 'tragic', 'ending', 'fit', 'brand', 'being', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'most', 'controversial', 'work.The', 'story', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'while', 'guilty', 'pleasure', '*nervous', 'laughter*', 'also', 'Scarlett', 'Letter', 'male', 'lead', 'Jude', 'must', 'face', 'world', 'slight', 'opinion', 'trade', 'value', 'bitter', 'end', 'own', 'family.It', 'very', 'modern', 'story']","Jude the Obscure 2 VHS Set, Complete Mini-Series"

555186,A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B00004WGBA,Caraculiambro,"[1, 2]","This is a BBC adaptation from 1971.  The most important thing you need to know is that it was filmed on video, so it's hard to escape the feeling of cheapness when you watch it.  I am told that despite the public's prejudices towards film, video actually renders a superior picture.  That may be true, but the fact is that as you watch this you'll be hard pressed to take it seriously, on account of our mental association of video and cheap soap operas.  The problem is especially acute with this production on account of the gravity of the ending.Further, the filmmakers don't appear to have had a lot of money, so most of the scenes are staged indoors.  Outdoor shots are brief and cramped.The three leads are superior, though, and very convincing.  The direction, while occasionally imaginative, is mostly stiff and forgettable.  (I'm guessing the director was much more comfortable with the stage than film, since it's almost like you're watching rigid adaptation fit better fit for the stage than the screen.)From its intimidating running time (over 4 hours), you might be tempted to think that is adaptation follows the book excruciatingly faithfully (unlike, say, the recentJude), but no, not especially.

555187,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B00004WGBA,Howard M. Kindel,"[0, 0]","There's something ambiguous about this production that, at first, seemed a bit too odd but, as the film progressed, became absolutely essential to the depiction of this most complex and controversial of Thomas Hardy's novels.  Namely, it came across as a hybrid between a play and a movie.  The sets didn't have an authentic 19th century Victorian feel so much as the look and feel of a stage set.  There was almost a flimsiness to the buildings, especially the interiors.  However, as the story moved forward, this stage setting atmosphere served to better emphasize the characters and their interaction.""Jude The Obscure"" is by far the most play-like of Hardy's novels in that the dialogue and characterizations almost completely dominate the setting, whereas, in all the other Hardy novels, the setting tends to dwarf the characters.  Even the city of Christminster, the centerpiece of Jude Fawley's entire existence, fades into the background as if it's no more than a cottage.  In this production nothing is allowed to diminish the dramatic tension between the characters.Robert Powell's performance as Jude Fawley was superlative in every aspect.  The only performances of any actor in any film I've every seen that rival Powell's are those of Ciaran Hinds in Hardy's ""The Mayor of Casterbridge,"" Leo McKern in Ibsen's ""The Master Builder"" and Michael Hordern in both Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" and ""The Tempest.""  Fiona Walker was superb as Sue Bridehead, bringing a malevolence to the somewhat cold-blooded character which wasn't readily apparent in the novel itself.  And Alex Marshall was wonderful as Arabella Donne, with a coarse sensuality that stayed with her as her station in life rose; although, as with Fiona Walker's Sue Bridehead, there was a sinister aspect to her characterization.  And John Franklyn-Robbins was picture perfect as the school master Phillotson, hopelessly drawn to Sue Bridehead.This is a tale of high tragedy, brought about by Jude's desire to transcend his lot in life amidst a society whose classes were rigidly defined and where very little existed to bridge the gap.  The great tragic irony is that if Jude could have been presented to the schools of divinity at Christminster while still a boy he might have succeeded in his ambition.  But having to teach himself in order to prepare for acceptance at Christminster, he grew to manhood too soon and his presenting himself as a potential divinity student became a mockery of his ambition.  Another great irony of this tale is that normally in Thomas Hardy's novels it's the women who are victimized by the caprice and callousness of the men; whereas in ""Jude the Obscure"" it's the men - both Jude and Phillotson - who are victimized by the caprice and callousness of the women.This was Hardy's last novel.  Not his last work; but its scandalous reception in Victorian England turned him away from the novel as a vehicle for expressing his pessimistic, even sardonic, view of life.  This film captures the essence of the novel, which is itself the inevitable expression of Hardy's view.  It's where all his other novels were leading.  And it was just too much for Victorian society.",5,Hybrid,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,3174,"['something', 'ambiguous', 'production', 'first', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'odd', 'film', 'progressed', 'became', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'depiction', 'most', 'complex', 'controversial', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'novels', 'Namely', 'came', 'hybrid', 'play', 'movie', 'sets', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'authentic', '19th', 'century', 'Victorian', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'look', 'feel', 'stage', 'set', 'was', 'almost', 'flimsiness', 'buildings', 'especially', 'interiors', 'However', 'story', 'moved', 'forward', 'stage', 'setting', 'atmosphere', 'served', 'better', 'emphasize', 'characters', 'interaction', 'Jude', 'Obscure', 'far', 'most', 'play-like', 'Hardy', 'novels', 'dialogue', 'characterizations', 'almost', 'completely', 'dominate', 'setting', 'whereas', 'other', 'Hardy', 'novels', 'setting', 'tends', 'dwarf', 'characters', 'Even', 'city', 'Christminster', 'centerpiece', 'Jude', 'Fawley', 'entire', 'existence', 'background', 'more', 'cottage', 'production', 'nothing', 'allowed', 'diminish', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'characters.Robert', 'Powell', 'performance', 'Jude', 'Fawley', 'was', 'superlative', 'aspect', 'only', 'performances', 'actor', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'rival', 'Powell', 'are', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Hardy', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Ibsen', 'Master', 'Builder', 'Michael', 'Hordern', 'Shakespeare', 'King', 'Lear', 'Tempest', 'Fiona', 'Walker', 'was', 'superb', 'Sue', 'Bridehead', 'bringing', 'malevolence', 'somewhat', 'cold-blooded', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'readily', 'apparent', 'novel', 'Alex', 'Marshall', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Arabella', 'Donne', 'coarse', 'sensuality', 'stayed', 'station', 'life', 'rose', 'Fiona', 'Walker', 'Sue', 'Bridehead', 'was', 'sinister', 'aspect', 'characterization', 'John', 'Franklyn-Robbins', 'was', 'picture', 'perfect', 'school', 'master', 'Phillotson', 'hopelessly', 'drawn', 'Sue', 'Bridehead.This', 'tale', 'high', 'tragedy', 'brought', 'Jude', 'desire', 'transcend', 'lot', 'life', 'society', 'classes', 'were', 'rigidly', 'defined', 'where', 'very', 'little', 'existed', 'bridge', 'gap', 'great', 'tragic', 'irony', 'Jude', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'schools', 'divinity', 'Christminster', 'still', 'boy', 'might', 'have', 'succeeded', 'ambition', 'having', 'teach', 'order', 'prepare', 'acceptance', 'Christminster', 'grew', 'manhood', 'too', 'soon', 'presenting', 'potential', 'divinity', 'student', 'became', 'mockery', 'ambition', 'great', 'irony', 'tale', 'normally', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'novels', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'victimized', 'caprice', 'callousness', 'men', 'whereas', 'Jude', 'Obscure', 'men', 'Jude', 'Phillotson', 'who', 'are', 'victimized', 'caprice', 'callousness', 'women.This', 'was', 'Hardy', 'last', 'novel', 'Not', 'last', 'work', 'scandalous', 'reception', 'Victorian', 'England', 'turned', 'away', 'novel', 'vehicle', 'expressing', 'pessimistic', 'even', 'sardonic', 'view', 'life', 'film', 'essence', 'novel', 'inevitable', 'expression', 'Hardy', 'view', 'where', 'other', 'novels', 'were', 'leading', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Victorian', 'society']","Jude the Obscure 2 VHS Set, Complete Mini-Series"
