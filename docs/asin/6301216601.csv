The original of this movie was named Best Picture and it's lead actor, Paul Scofield, was named best actor.  The original is heralded as one of the best movies ever made.  In short, the original comes about as close to perfection as a movie can.So why even attempt a remake?  What is to be gained?  A better question might be, ""what is to be lost?""Much!  This remake doesn't even come remotely close to what was achieved by the original.  A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, the remake, is a movie that had no business being made.Charlton Heston as Thomas More? Not a patch to Scofield's performance. In fact as Chuck's performance continued, I found myself whispering to myself the lines from a far better Heston acting effort, THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY, ""When will you make an end, Michelangelo?"" Heston's performance here was pure agony! John Gielgud, as Cardinal Wolsey, can't even begin to touch the hem of the robes worn by Orson Welles who defined and mastered this role in the original.  And it's incredibly bizarre, as well, that Vanessa Redgrave, who cameoed nicely the part of Anne Boleyn in the original, wouldn't know better about assuming the role of Lady Alice More and falling considerable short of the original performance of Wendy Hiller.The rest of the cast is equally miscast as they attempt to fill shoes of veritable ""Who's Who"" of British and American Cinema, shoes so big that none of them had a chance from the beginning.  But, again, how do you compete with or remake a movie that was perfect to begin with?Don't waste your time with this flop.

For one thing, he keeps the all important narrator, the everyman figure, the one who represents most of humanity.Heston does a good job in making Thomas More not only a lawyer, an intellectual and saint but also a very human, witty man. He loves life but when his principles come into conflict with the wishes of Henry VIII of England he follows those principles to the very end of his life.Wish we had more like him today.The acting is uniformly good, nay outstanding. Heston has been accused of being stiff and grandiose - not in this movie. His portrayal is very human, down to earth. The rest of the cast is also very, very good.

246995,A3H6HGQFL1GBO2,6301216601,"Claude Greenmount ""semper ubi sub ubi!""","[1, 2]","As mentioned, this is not the screen play that was adapted for the 1966 film starring Paul Scofield, but rather a filmed version of the original stage play by Robert Bolt.  Of course much material overlaps, but it is a distinctly different approach and performance.  This is NOT a video of a thetrical performance, but a fully realized 'film' performance, simply using the theatrical script as screen play.  The most noticeable difference is, of course, the presence of The Common Man (admirably executed by Roy Kinnear), a character which is cut in the 1966 film adaptation and replaced by individual actors playing the host of characters The Common Man covers in the play.  John Gielgud is given an upper billing, and he is of course an excellent--if more slender than one would expect-- Cardinal Wolsey.  His Wolsey is not as menacing as Orson Welles' Wolsey in the '66 movie, but none-the-less is clearly a determined, pragmatic, Machiavellian bureaucrat who makes it clear he will brook no resistance from Sir Thomas More, or anyone else.  But these are Gielgud's only few moments on the screen (Wolsey's ""Fall"" is not depicted in the play, as it was in the earlier film, but only mentioned in passing later).  Vanessa Redgrave returns to the script, this time as Lady Alice More, Thomas' wife (she appeared briefly in the non-speaking role of Anne Boleyn in the '66 film; Mistress Boleyn is never actually seen in the play) and she is by turns humorous, fierce, tragic and always convincing.For me, the most pleasant surprise was Charleton Heston-- an accomplished actor, whose unfortunate late-in-life attachments to 'campier' film projects and far-right politics caused him to be dismissed as a significant talent by many.  However his abilities are fully shown here.  The performance is subtle, elegant, and powerful.  He takes a different approach than Scofield, as one would expect, and it works to the character's and story line's advantage (I take nothing from Sir Paul; he is the Definitive Man for All Seasons, of course).  Scofield plays the noble, determined martyr who won't give in; Heston is more unconvinced of his ability to face what he knows must happen and musters his courage through the certainty that he is right to stand up for what he believes in.  Both are convincingly saddened when they realize the lengths that former friends will go to in order to achieve their ends.If you are already a fan of this play and the 1966 movie, this is highly recommended.  If you are just getting to know it, stil highly recommended.  The theatrical purist may find it more to his or her liking than the 1966 film version.",5,Outstanding performances,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,2638,"['mentioned', 'not', 'screen', 'play', 'was', 'adapted', '1966', 'film', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'rather', 'filmed', 'version', 'original', 'stage', 'play', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'course', 'much', 'material', 'overlaps', 'distinctly', 'different', 'approach', 'performance', 'NOT', 'video', 'thetrical', 'performance', 'fully', 'realized', ""'film"", 'performance', 'simply', 'using', 'theatrical', 'script', 'screen', 'play', 'most', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'course', 'presence', 'Common', 'Man', 'admirably', 'executed', 'Roy', 'Kinnear', 'character', 'cut', '1966', 'film', 'adaptation', 'replaced', 'individual', 'actors', 'playing', 'host', 'characters', 'Common', 'Man', 'play', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'given', 'upper', 'billing', 'course', 'excellent', 'more', 'slender', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'Wolsey', 'not', 'as', 'menacing', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Wolsey', ""'66"", 'movie', 'none-the-less', 'clearly', 'determined', 'pragmatic', 'Machiavellian', 'bureaucrat', 'who', 'clear', 'will', 'brook', 'resistance', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'anyone', 'else', 'are', 'Gielgud', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'screen', 'Wolsey', 'Fall', 'not', 'depicted', 'play', 'was', 'earlier', 'film', 'only', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'later', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'returns', 'script', 'time', 'Lady', 'Alice', 'More', 'Thomas', 'wife', 'appeared', 'briefly', 'non-speaking', 'role', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', ""'66"", 'film', 'Mistress', 'Boleyn', 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'play', 'turns', 'humorous', 'fierce', 'tragic', 'always', 'convincing.For', 'most', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'was', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'unfortunate', 'late-in-life', 'attachments', ""'campier"", 'film', 'projects', 'far-right', 'politics', 'caused', 'be', 'dismissed', 'significant', 'talent', 'many', 'However', 'abilities', 'are', 'fully', 'shown', 'here', 'performance', 'subtle', 'elegant', 'powerful', 'different', 'approach', 'Scofield', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'character', 'story', 'line', 'advantage', 'take', 'nothing', 'Sir', 'Paul', 'Definitive', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'course', 'Scofield', 'noble', 'determined', 'martyr', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'Heston', 'more', 'unconvinced', 'ability', 'face', 'what', 'must', 'happen', 'musters', 'courage', 'certainty', 'right', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'are', 'convincingly', 'saddened', 'when', 'realize', 'lengths', 'former', 'friends', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'achieve', 'ends.If', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'play', '1966', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'know', 'highly', 'recommended', 'theatrical', 'purist', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'liking', '1966', 'film', 'version']",Man for All Seasons VHS

Sometimes remakes can be wonderful, and sometimes they can add a fresh interpretation to time-honoured themes and stories; alas, such is not the case here.Charleton Heston is woefully mis-cast as the principled and intelligent Thomas More; Heston is a very good actor, and has done such a range of characters that it is not that I see a Moses or Michelangelo here - it just doesn't work.

Unfortunately, he just doesn't have enough screen-time or involvement in the overall plot to save this piece.  Vanessa Redgrave as Lady Alice is also another terrific actor mis-cast; Redgrave's stunning performances in film and on stage (I've been fortunate to see her in several West End productions) have something that isn't present here.The minor casting of important figures like Richard Rich, Henry VIII and Cranmer also pale so far from the original film casting that the less said here, the better.I give one star for reasonable sets and production values, and a second star for having the presence of mind to recall this wonderful Bolt play and screenplay and try to revive it for a new generation of viewers.
