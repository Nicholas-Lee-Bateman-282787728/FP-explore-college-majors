909813,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B0009OUBEW,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[8, 8]","In this Lifetime TV movie, Gary Cole does a terrific job, as usual, playing a popular high school football coach allowed to seduce young students because he's necessary to a winning team and because parents haven't complained about his behavior up to now.  This time he seduces a 14-year-old who is at first flattered then fearful of reporting his behavior because of her fears about the consequence to him.  Being more concerned for the abuser than herself is typical behavior of someone being abused.  She finally shares her experience with her mother and the man is arrested, convicted and sent to jail.  The people at the school, however, turn against the student for robbing them of the well-liked coach and so her family takes the situation even further by suing the school in court for allowing the teacher to use his power to seduce a youngster.The ending should have depicted a trial with a rousing statement from the judge defending young people everywhere from the terrible misuse of a teacher's power, but it ends with a written blurb telling us the outcome, which weakens the movie and is less satisfying than having the message dramatized would have been.The story and acting are still compelling enough to be pretty good.",3,Decent Drama,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,1236,"['Lifetime', 'TV', 'movie', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'terrific', 'job', 'usual', 'playing', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'coach', 'allowed', 'seduce', 'young', 'students', 'necessary', 'winning', 'team', 'parents', 'have', ""n't"", 'complained', 'behavior', 'now', 'time', '14-year-old', 'who', 'first', 'flattered', 'then', 'fearful', 'reporting', 'behavior', 'fears', 'consequence', 'Being', 'more', 'concerned', 'abuser', 'typical', 'behavior', 'someone', 'being', 'abused', 'finally', 'shares', 'experience', 'mother', 'man', 'arrested', 'convicted', 'sent', 'jail', 'people', 'school', 'however', 'turn', 'student', 'robbing', 'well-liked', 'coach', 'so', 'family', 'situation', 'even', 'further', 'suing', 'school', 'court', 'allowing', 'teacher', 'use', 'power', 'seduce', 'youngster.The', 'ending', 'should', 'have', 'depicted', 'trial', 'rousing', 'statement', 'judge', 'defending', 'young', 'people', 'everywhere', 'terrible', 'misuse', 'teacher', 'power', 'written', 'blurb', 'telling', 'outcome', 'movie', 'less', 'satisfying', 'having', 'message', 'dramatized', 'would', 'have', 'been.The', 'story', 'acting', 'are', 'still', 'compelling', 'enough', 'be', 'pretty', 'good']",Indecent Seduction

909815,A22UN88SYY3Q7G,B0009OUBEW,J. J. Star,"[2, 2]","Excellent movie! Very well done.The story takes place in  fictional Tate High School in fictional Tate, Okalahoma, but this is a true story and it all happened in Taylor, Texas and is based on a magazine article cited in the movie credits.Gary Cole portrays a highschool football Coach who seems to have never grown up, which Cole depicts in the movie as a mature man driving a teenager's type of pickup truck and behaving like a 17 year old himself with his flirting and worse, as well as providing the kids he liked with liquor.In the movie, the Coach's method was to single out a young girl in his Biology class every year, always a freshman, whom he lavished with special attention and privileges, and then intentionally manipulated and coerced into a brief sexual affair that, once ended, left the teenage girl stunned and shunned by her classmates.  The irony of the story is that the Coach became completely obsessed with the last young girl he'd ever fool around with, played by Nicholle Tom, and his desperate actions to keep her to himself and control her brought him down.Cole's portrayal of the Coach was his usual perfect performance and Nicholle Tom was riveting as the innocent young girl who was lured by flattering attention into a situation she didn't know how to stop.  The theme song, ""Oh What a Thrill"", by the Mavericks, stays in your mind long after you've watched this movieIndecent Seduction was well done, careful to not get graphic, and portrayed the characters honestly enough.  The Coach pled guilty to a class of misdemeanor that kept him from a long prison sentence as well as allowing him to avoid graphic testimony in open court.The young girl's parents, played exactly right by Mary Kay Place and Mac Davis, particularly Mary Kay Place as the  mother, showed them to be massively stressed out and dissatisfied with the sentence the Coach received.  Both the girl and her parents were very courageous in not giving up on bringing not only the Coach to justice but the highschool Principal and Board of Education as well.  They made history in Texas and Supreme Court case law as well, which provides a basis today for the protection of students from sexual predators and abuse of power by school teachers and administrators all over the country.",5,Superb Gary Cole Performance,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,2278,"['Excellent', 'movie', 'Very', 'well', 'done.The', 'story', 'place', 'fictional', 'Tate', 'High', 'School', 'fictional', 'Tate', 'Okalahoma', 'true', 'story', 'happened', 'Taylor', 'Texas', 'based', 'magazine', 'article', 'cited', 'movie', 'credits.Gary', 'Cole', 'highschool', 'football', 'Coach', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'grown', 'up', 'Cole', 'movie', 'mature', 'man', 'driving', 'teenager', 'type', 'pickup', 'truck', 'behaving', '17', 'year', 'old', 'flirting', 'worse', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'kids', 'liked', 'movie', 'Coach', 'method', 'was', 'single', 'out', 'young', 'girl', 'Biology', 'class', 'year', 'always', 'freshman', 'whom', 'lavished', 'special', 'attention', 'privileges', 'then', 'intentionally', 'manipulated', 'coerced', 'brief', 'sexual', 'affair', 'once', 'ended', 'left', 'teenage', 'girl', 'stunned', 'shunned', 'classmates', 'irony', 'story', 'Coach', 'became', 'completely', 'obsessed', 'last', 'young', 'girl', ""'d"", 'ever', 'fool', 'played', 'Nicholle', 'Tom', 'desperate', 'actions', 'keep', 'control', 'brought', 'down.Cole', 'portrayal', 'Coach', 'was', 'usual', 'perfect', 'performance', 'Nicholle', 'Tom', 'was', 'riveting', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'lured', 'flattering', 'attention', 'situation', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'stop', 'theme', 'song', 'Oh', 'What', 'Thrill', 'Mavericks', 'mind', 'long', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movieIndecent', 'Seduction', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'careful', 'not', 'get', 'graphic', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'honestly', 'enough', 'Coach', 'pled', 'guilty', 'class', 'misdemeanor', 'kept', 'long', 'prison', 'sentence', 'as', 'well', 'allowing', 'avoid', 'graphic', 'testimony', 'open', 'court.The', 'young', 'girl', 'parents', 'played', 'exactly', 'right', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Mac', 'Davis', 'particularly', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'mother', 'showed', 'be', 'massively', 'stressed', 'out', 'dissatisfied', 'sentence', 'Coach', 'received', 'girl', 'parents', 'were', 'very', 'courageous', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'bringing', 'not', 'only', 'Coach', 'justice', 'highschool', 'Principal', 'Board', 'Education', 'well', 'made', 'history', 'Texas', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'case', 'law', 'as', 'well', 'basis', 'today', 'protection', 'students', 'sexual', 'predators', 'abuse', 'power', 'school', 'teachers', 'administrators', 'country']",Indecent Seduction

Teachers want to show students that they care, and students often need to feel like there are trustworthy adults in their lives who can assist them.However, some people can exploit these needs for their own twisted purposes.""Indecent Seduction"" is a true story about a young girl in a rural school who is victimized by her science teacher, Coach Nash.  Nash's charisma masks a perverted mentality in which he manipulates young girls for his own satisfaction.  It is truly shocking the amount of thhings this man was allowed to get away with! Those who try to report him are ignored because of Nash's masterful coaching techniques.  How sad that some school systems care about prestige instead of their students! Don't get me started!This movie is heartwrenching, but there is a ray of hope as well.  The actors/actresses do very well in their roles, and Gary Cole is particularly convincing as the coach.
