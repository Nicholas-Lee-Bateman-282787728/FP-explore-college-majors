While the movie is good and interesting, it is far from being impartial.

This movie has Scott Peterson walking around with &quot;GUILTY&quot; written all over him.  Hypothetically speaking, what if the Laci Peterson murder was something that was similar to the Dr. Sam Sheppard case?

817335,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B0001Z3HWC,MollyRK,"[8, 8]","My curiosity and heightening interest in the Laci Peterson case finally compelled me to rent this film. Having become heavily focused on all aspects of the case from the time I read Sharon Rocha's recent heart-tugger ""For Laci,"" I was very interested in seeing the film that was formulated and inspired by Amber Frey's quickly released book ""Witness.""My opinions on the performance of Dean Cain clearly will not differ from those of anyone else's on this site; he did a remarkable job at hitting it right on the nail. His eyes, his mannerisms, his behavior...it was all amazingly on target. In his interviews and conversations with others about Laci, Scott Peterson has been known for using ""uh"" and ""um"" more than actual words from the English language in order to bridge the gap between concocting his lies and actually saying them. The way he has stared into space and babbled aimlessly to the extent that he sometimes actually forgot the question he was initially asked speaks volumes in itself, and Dean Cain did a perfect job at re-enacting that.As for the film focusing predominantly on Scott, his behavior and his two ""composite"" friends Tommy and Kate, I think what we have to understand here is that this movie was made just as Scott was arrested and taken to trial. That was a point in the case where everything started crashing down, and of course everyone wanted to get as much emphasis as they could on how Scott Peterson was reacting to everything surrounding his wife's disappearance, as well as the discovery of Laci and Conner's bodies. At that time, everyone really needed and wanted to see what Scott's present role was in all of this, and I think that was the portrait this movie tried to convey.Granted, the movie was made much too early, but such is to be expected with cases like this--people are always eager to spawn a TV movie as quickly as possible. The scenes were choppy and seemed to end really abruptly. It was a quick-paced, 86-minute TV film that lacked emotion and close examination of Laci's family and friends, who deserve to have their perspective acknowledged.All in all, though, it was a good enough film for what it was: a quick, informative story that wanted to lay out some facts and shed some light on Scott's overall demeanor. Even if some of the information was a bit scattered and wayward, they did a good job at zooming in on Scott and revisiting some of the word-to-word conversations that he had with police, Amber, friends, and members of Laci's family.It is a truly gripping story, unforgettable and worthy of a fuller portrait (similar to the book that Laci's mother Sharon wrote earlier this year). Given a few more years (or maybe a lot more years), I think this will make a terrific movie, providing more complete details and a well-rounded pursuit of the feelings and emotions experienced by everyone involved. It's a case with very raw human emotions that America has really gravitated to, and it is really a startling moment from history that people will remember for decades to come. A future movie could include areas about Scott and Laci's courtship, marriage, and life before December 24, 2002. So much has been documented about Scott, his mistress Amber Frey, and the charges he has faced, but it would be nice to get even more on sweet Laci--the innocent victim who was mere weeks away from delivering her first child when an indescribable crime took it all away from her. Discussing all these details would surely make an excellent film that I would watch without hesitation, and I have no doubt that it will eventually happen.",4,"broad, choppy, yet interesting take on a very important case",1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,3593,"['curiosity', 'heightening', 'interest', 'Laci', 'Peterson', 'case', 'finally', 'compelled', 'rent', 'film', 'Having', 'become', 'heavily', 'focused', 'aspects', 'case', 'time', 'read', 'Sharon', 'Rocha', 'recent', 'heart-tugger', 'Laci', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'formulated', 'inspired', 'Amber', 'Frey', 'quickly', 'released', 'book', 'Witness', 'opinions', 'performance', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'clearly', 'will', 'not', 'differ', 'anyone', 'else', 'site', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'hitting', 'right', 'nail', 'eyes', 'mannerisms', 'behavior', 'was', 'amazingly', 'target', 'interviews', 'conversations', 'others', 'Laci', 'Scott', 'Peterson', 'been', 'known', 'using', 'uh', 'um', 'more', 'actual', 'words', 'English', 'language', 'order', 'bridge', 'gap', 'concocting', 'lies', 'actually', 'saying', 'way', 'stared', 'space', 'babbled', 'aimlessly', 'extent', 'actually', 'forgot', 'question', 'was', 'initially', 'asked', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'did', 'perfect', 'job', 're-enacting', 'that.As', 'film', 'focusing', 'predominantly', 'Scott', 'behavior', 'two', 'composite', 'friends', 'Tommy', 'Kate', 'think', 'what', 'have', 'understand', 'here', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'Scott', 'was', 'arrested', 'taken', 'trial', 'was', 'point', 'case', 'where', 'everything', 'started', 'crashing', 'down', 'course', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'emphasis', 'could', 'how', 'Scott', 'Peterson', 'was', 'reacting', 'everything', 'surrounding', 'wife', 'disappearance', 'as', 'well', 'discovery', 'Laci', 'Conner', 'bodies', 'time', 'everyone', 'really', 'needed', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'Scott', 'present', 'role', 'was', 'think', 'was', 'portrait', 'movie', 'tried', 'convey.Granted', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'much', 'too', 'early', 'such', 'be', 'expected', 'cases', 'people', 'are', 'always', 'eager', 'spawn', 'TV', 'movie', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'scenes', 'were', 'choppy', 'seemed', 'end', 'really', 'abruptly', 'was', 'quick-paced', '86-minute', 'TV', 'film', 'lacked', 'emotion', 'close', 'examination', 'Laci', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'deserve', 'have', 'perspective', 'acknowledged.All', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'quick', 'informative', 'story', 'wanted', 'lay', 'out', 'facts', 'shed', 'light', 'Scott', 'overall', 'demeanor', 'Even', 'information', 'was', 'bit', 'scattered', 'wayward', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'zooming', 'Scott', 'revisiting', 'word-to-word', 'conversations', 'had', 'police', 'Amber', 'members', 'Laci', 'family.It', 'truly', 'gripping', 'story', 'unforgettable', 'worthy', 'fuller', 'portrait', 'similar', 'book', 'Laci', 'mother', 'Sharon', 'wrote', 'earlier', 'year', 'Given', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'maybe', 'lot', 'more', 'years', 'think', 'will', 'make', 'terrific', 'movie', 'providing', 'more', 'complete', 'details', 'well-rounded', 'pursuit', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'experienced', 'everyone', 'involved', 'case', 'very', 'raw', 'human', 'emotions', 'America', 'really', 'gravitated', 'really', 'startling', 'moment', 'history', 'people', 'will', 'remember', 'decades', 'come', 'future', 'movie', 'could', 'include', 'areas', 'Scott', 'Laci', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'life', 'December', '24', '2002', 'So', 'much', 'been', 'documented', 'Scott', 'mistress', 'Amber', 'Frey', 'charges', 'faced', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'sweet', 'Laci', 'innocent', 'victim', 'who', 'was', 'mere', 'weeks', 'away', 'delivering', 'first', 'child', 'when', 'indescribable', 'crime', 'took', 'away', 'Discussing', 'details', 'would', 'surely', 'make', 'excellent', 'film', 'would', 'watch', 'hesitation', 'have', 'doubt', 'will', 'eventually', 'happen']",The Perfect Husband: The Laci Peterson Story

Add the annoying best friend who refused to believe anything bad about Scott Peterson and this made it a reasonably difficult 84 minutes to sit through.Those criticisms aside, Dean Cain was quite good in his role as Scott, as was the grieving Dee Wallace as Laci's mother.  However at the end of the day, why does a movie like this get made when this sort of thing goes on all the time every day of the week across the world.
