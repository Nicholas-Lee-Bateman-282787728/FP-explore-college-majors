This move was made in 1999 therefore in that time Black/White relations were much more strained than they are today. This film is a gauge for how far America has come as well as how economically depressed we have become. The film omits why each race is economically separated as to not addressing slavery and basic history. Viewing this film in 2011 turns the film into a comedic look at poor Whites and affluent Blacks just for the simplistic view of the reality that a large portion of this film depicts. For example, in the U.S.A today we have white trash and prosperous Blacks but the striking element that is so vulgar is the reality of commercial television. This film hits home when it depicts TV as all Black for the simple fact that commercial television today is all white and that is not all right. Sure we have come far in creating equality and from 1999 to today there has been a major breakthrough in race relations and I am talking about the reality of the United States electing a Black President. I suggest getting this film just for the monumental task of even trying to flip racial reality.

I pull no punches with critiques of this sort of thing, it should be stated right off the bat. It took me probably 15 minutes into this film to realize what it is.Harry Belafonte is a selfish, powerful corporate owner who cares nothing about his white employees; he is clearly a racist. When a dedicated plant worker (John Travolta trying to kick-start his career here) gets fired for no good reason, he kidnaps the boss at gunpoint. He only wants his due: the money he has lost since being fired.This weird, sometimes pointless film is stunning, showing in full sci-fi glory what it would be like if the roles of blacks and whites were reversed. Trouble is, this is too stark and sometimes mindless. Travolta is allegedly doing what a black man would do ... just remember, this is a reverse-parallel-universe thing.So, they're telling us an angry black man - hardworking, devoted to his family - loses his job, goes nuts and kidnaps the owner of the company?? This could have been a brilliant film, but what the hell were they thinking?!Travolta plays a character who is immature, dimwitted, terribly angry and swears like no one I've ever heard this side of my aunt. Then he allows the boss to suffer a heart attack while in his custody and does not have any idea what to do about it. Therefore, he naturally panics because he's not smart enough to do anything else.Yes, I see where the filmmaker was going with all this - and even so, I found it a racist interpretation and I found it slighlty offensive. My father was a hardworking black man, as were his surviving male relatives. Many of my closest pals as well as relatives are hardworking black folk. If they'd been screwed over, well, they'd be mad!But understand this: they would not have gone bonkers and kidnapped someone at gunpoint because they got angry ... or under any circumstances. I can guarantee that, because some were law enforcement officials and we were all raised properly. So here is Travolta as the underdog second-class citizen and THIS is how they portray him.All in all, I'd say this film would have been much better served if it had been made purely by a black director and crew. Also, the casting of Travolta in this is what brought so much wrath on him that his career has not recovered yet.See it for the carnival sideshow aspect, see it for the happenstance social commentary. After all, Harry Belafonte (whom I have always loved) must have seen something worthwhile in it or he would not have been in it.

43647,A3TIJC6L8USJ6Q,0783115008,Elderbear,"[5, 8]","The premise for this movie is simple. Dark skinned people have power, money and privilege. White skinned people ape them, resent them, suck up to them, and are scorned, oppressed, and humiliated by them. Travolta, as a fired factory worker, and Belafonte, as the factory owner, do quite a decent job of carrying the movie. The plot is a bit cliched and the ending comes as no surprise. But the emotional power of seeing a racial power reversal makes this a movie worth watching.It also is one of the movie's biggest drawbacks. Considering race alone, while ignoring other oppressive social structures and patterns, was simple, but also simplistic. In melodramatizing Travolta's violent response to Belafonte's callousness, it missed the opportunity to be a far more complex vehicle considering the oppression of hierarchical systems, even to members of the dominant race and gender. Dominator political and social systems go unquestioned in the movie, which only examines the racial aspects of oppression. Too bad--this could have been great.Worth every one of the three stars I gave it.

43648,ALSTMFDRPWWWK,0783115008,Firestarter,"[4, 6]","I ordered this film after reading a comment on a blog from a black nationalist. While the concept of the film is GOOD (white people and black people in America basically switch places...Black people on top economically, racially and socially...white people at the bottom) the actual execution of the concept is terrible.***WARING SPOILERS BELOW!***Here are a few problems with script and plot:1). John Travolta is not convincing in the role of an oppressed white man. The character curses over and over again and he is not articulate. I'm assuming this is the way the writers of this film see black men in the real world. Furthermore, the character is more comical than anything else. It is hard to sympathize with the character, which I think it is important if the film's purpose is to examine the impact of social/racial inequality.2). Harry Belafonte as the patriarch of his family is good. The imaginary used in the beginning of the film to show that black people not only reign supreme but are also the STANDARD OF BEAUTY (i.e, their hair is natural, their clothing is afrocentric, black art lines their walls, and all things black is viewed as good) is good. Even the images people watch on television and see in church are all black, which again is good imaginary for this concept. However, this is all undermined when Belafonte's black son comes home with a white woman.Given the reality that the standard of beauty has FLIPPED with black women being the most sought after women...this plot point of the black son/white girlfriend doesn't make a bit of sense.Part of white supremacy in our REAL world relies on WHITE MEN HAVING WHITE CHILDREN TO KEEP WHITE SUPREMACY GOING. If this film is supposed to be the black version of that it's safe to say a black man would take more care with his seed and not be so quick to mix it with another race. It's very likely he would feel shame if he had a non-black woman on his arm. It's likely his family and friends would give him hell for it in this flipped reality.In this film black men have a legacy to pass on. They own businesses. They take pride in their race, their history and all things black. Black pride is clearly important to them. This is one of the main differences between black men and white men in the REAL world. So having a BLACK CHILD would be important to them in this flipped reality. Black children will carry their legacy, their names and keep BLACK SUPREMACY GOING.If the writers of this script truly wanted to cause a stir in a world where BLACK people reign supreme they should have introduced a BLACK DAUGHTER for Belafonte's character and given her a WHITE BOYFRIEND. Remember in this film BLACK is the standard of beauty. It would be a more accurate flip of what we see today in the real world.This brings up another key point: with the flip of racial, social, and economic dynamics sexual dynamics would also change. Black women would be considered just as desirable as black men in this world (as both white women and white men are in the real world...they are equally pursued by all races often because of white supremacy).Black men and black women should find themselves equally prized in this flip reality. This flipped reality is a FAR cry from what we see in the real world where black men appear to be more sexually prized than black women. I would think in this flipped reality a white man would find himself more sexually desirable than a white woman. It's likely he would find himself  represented MORE in the media (albeit in a stereotypical fashion) than his counterpart, who unfortunately would probably either be invisible or represented in the most stereotypical fashion (imagine if black women and white women switched places if you don't understand...and imagine white men making the evening news everyday).Men would probably be put off by white women given their portrayal in the media. On other hand, a stereotypical image of a white man might sexually interest SOME black woman (the Mandingo effect but with white men). Again this shows it would have made more sense to create a black daughter and have her fall in love with a white man....as it would probably be the most likely interracial relationship involving someone black and someone white in this flipped reality.And because black men and white men despise each other in this film (and in the real world it seems) a black woman (the standard of beauty) with a white man is more likely to cause much more of a commotion than a black man with a white woman (remembering white women are the bottom of the totem pole in this flipped reality...a white man dating a black woman would be seen as dating ""up"" while a black man dating a white women would be seen as dating ""down""). The white man would likely feel he is ""taking"" something from the black men who oppress him. The same would not be true for a black man dating a white woman. He would simply be looked down upon by members of the master race, which in this film is the black race.A black woman dating a white man might be equally as shamed but women typically follow their hearts. They don't worry about passing on daddy's name, company and legacy or holding on to racial power. These are very much things that MEN value. So, while dating a white man in this flipped reality might bring shame on a black woman, she likely wouldn't care as much a black man would. He would fear the social penalties that come with dating outside his race and having biracial children.Think about white men who fear dating black women because they are afraid what their friends and family might say in the real world. They fear their father might write them out of the will or disown them. White women don't care as much about this sort of thing because they don't value the same thing that white men value or maybe they do, but not to the same extent as white men.Men and women are simply guided by different things in life. Women are guided by their hearts and desire. Men are guided by a combination of things and one those things is POWER. They not only want power, but they want to secure it and monopolize it. In order to maintain this power in the form of racial supremacy they need the women of their race. Again women don't think this way. Black men would probably ostracize a black woman who dared to date outside her race in this flipped reality. And while she might be hurt by their actions it won't stop her from following her heart.The son dating a white woman also falls short because we NEVER see a reaction from his mother or his father. The issue is never even discussed. He shows up a the house with a white woman one day and the mother's reaction is simply a look that says ""Oh!"" Well in a world where black people reign supreme and are looking to protect their positions at the top I would think this issue would be explored more.3). John Travolta's character is having a bad day...okay we get it. His loses his job after Belafonte's character has him fired from his friend's company after Travolta is caught looking at Belafonte's wife through a window. He lives in the ghetto (all white) in a house he cannot afford. His wife leaves him, and his kid suffers from self-hate (thanks to black supremacy...the doll test with the little boy picking a black action figure instead of a white action figure was a nice touch). In the midst of his bad day Travolta's character is the victim of police brutality (by black racist cops), which honestly comes completely out of nowhere. It was awkwardly placed in the middle of the story and it made no sense. I understand the writers wanted to explore all the injustices suffered by oppressed people but this plot point made no sense. It was misplaced in my opinion.4). Belafonte is kidnapped by Travolta's character. In the midst of this kidnapping Belafonte grows to sympathize with his kidnapper. I like this plot point but it seemed misplaced because Belafonte's character can be heard criticizing white men, who he deems ""inferior"" throughout the beginning of the film. I highly doubt his opinion of white men would change after being kidnapped by a white man. In fact, his hatred would probably grow.5). The ending is horrible. It seems like the ending was rushed. Travolta's character dies. Belafonte pays a visit to his wife and gives her the money Travolta's character thought he was owed. That is how the film ends.In closing, it's not surprising this film is celebrated by black nationalist. It completely misses the mark and often they do too with their nonsense. Only they can't seem to see it. Those of us not caught in the matrix of hating/disliking folks based on a social construct like race can see the nonsense. This film was a good effort, but it unfortunately doesn't live up to the hype.",2,This Film Almost Completely Missed The Mark,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,8765,"['ordered', 'film', 'reading',

People are missing the point of this farce by thinking it such a grand demonstration of role reversal/stereotypes and oooo what a lesson we'll learn!Travolta's married character is fired because he peeped into a window at a naked woman. He got what he deserved but blames what happened to him on another. Seems blacks in the 'real' world do that too. They don't look at their own actions. Whitey made me do the wrong thing. Travolta's character essentially says the same thing.Funny how no one complains that John Travolta's character is MALE.That's gender racism.A woman lead can't be like him in Hollywood. They're too busy being stereotypically portrayed as sexual objects with the mental capacity of a bowl of fruit.""White Man's Burden"" reinforces one thing if you want to talk honestly about racism. It only is racism when it's a black/white issue.Role reversal doesn't change that.Asians aren't going to shout ""Where are we?"" in ""White Man's Burden"" because they're perfectly content to see their bretheren stereotypically portrayed as Bruce Lee clones.Hispanics don't holler ""Where are we?"" in ""White Man's Burden"".They have their own movies like ""Stand and Deliver"" that adds to films portraying them as bit part gang members cruising in low riders, speaking like the Frito Bandito, or doing West Side Story dance numbers. They're always used to pass for Native Americans too. ""We're on screen"" at least they sigh.Native Americans aren't crying ""Where are we?"" in ""White Man's Burden"". They're perfectly content to play modern day reservation Indians living in squalor or be ""Dances With Wolves"" extras. I don't hear any Native Americans shout ""We want to see real Native actors not Hispanics 'passing' for  us. We want to see a Native actor playing Super Indian with a college education living in a New York Penthouse getting rich off his business sense in ventures other than Bingo and shouting greed is good""Gays can't shout ""Where are we?"" in ""White Man's Burden"" because they're in movies portrayed as dying of AIDES or as swishy drag queens. They even have their own ""Queer as Folk"" cable show. That's racism in itself by using that disparaging term for themselves! But if we straights call 'em ""queer"" then we're insulting them.Instead of trying to laud ""White Man's Burden"" for supposedly exposing racism in reverse, how about demanding Hollywood make a movie that portrays a world without racial disharmony for once. But how silly of me. Demanding such a movie is like demanding one without exploding car chases,scantily clad dim witted women or the 800th sequel of a serial killer heaving ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" before he hacks you in a million pieces. Just wouldn't sell.

Shirley ""Laurie's Boomer Views""","[14, 14]","This review refers to ""White Man's Burden""(VHS)...Fresh off his success as a take no prisoners hitman, in ""Pulp Fiction"", John Travolta steps into the shoes of another man with a gun, Louis Pinnock. Louis is your everyday factory worker, living from pay check to pay check to support his family. He lives in the inner-city, and hopes to someday get just a little ahead, so he can move his family to a quieter, safer place. He's about to have a really bad week!Volunteering to run an errand, delivering a package to factory owner Thaddius Thomas (Harry Belafonte), Louis has the unfortunate timing to glance Belafonte's wife as she undresses, and worse, Thomas sees him. The next thing we know,circumstances go from bad to worse. Louis is out of a job, a home and his mind. Blaming his boss, he feels he is ""owed"" what he lost,and becomes a desperate man.He kidnaps Belafonte, from his very upscale home and car at gunpoint.This film is a real eye-opener. You may think you understand what it is like for inner-city, black families(or any minority group)and feel empathetic, but this is a film that will really make you sit up and take notice.The roles are reversed.Travolta's character and his family are treated very much like second or third class citizens.Police automatically assume guilt, and take whatever means they want to make an arrest. The inner-city is mostly inhabited by whites, and is portrayed as crime infested neighborhoods. A little white boy is watching TV, as he flips through the channels, almost every program and commercial are black actors. The little boy wants a super hero action toy for his birthday. The super hero is black and more expensive then the white side kick, but the little boy wont settle for less.An elegant fashion show is put on by the very wealthy. It is to benefit the inner-city kids. The kids are showcased at the end... they are all white... the audience dressed to the nines, all black.The film doesn't completely say everything is either black or white. It shows there is good and bad in every walk of life,has a sprinkling of whites in jobs that yield some power, but gives a good look at what many people must endure as human beings in day-to day life. It's not just about color..it's about the nature of man. How will Belafonte's character react, when he becomes desperate to escape his situation as well? Does it matter what color you are when faced with adversity?The cast really became the characters they portrayed. Travolta and Belafonte were excellent. A young Andrew Lawrence, Magaret Avery(The Color Purple)and Tom bower add their talents as well.Even the angry gang members, played by stunt guys including Tony Zeller were very believable. A film for times you may want a little more substance then just entertainment.It is a film that will make you think.It is a film that has something to say. It says it well, but it is probably not one that would stand up to repeated viewings. A rental would be best if you can find this obscure film.....Laurie",4,On The Outside Looking In,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,3011,"['review', 'White', 'Man', 'Burden', 'VHS', 'Fresh', 'success', 'take', 'prisoners', 'hitman', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'John', 'Travolta', 'shoes', 'man', 'gun', 'Louis', 'Pinnock', 'Louis', 'everyday', 'factory', 'worker', 'living', 'pay', 'check', 'pay', 'check', 'support', 'family', 'inner-city', 'someday', 'get', 'just', 'little', 'ahead', 'can', 'move', 'family', 'quieter', 'safer', 'place', 'have', 'really', 'bad', 'week', 'Volunteering', 'run', 'errand', 'delivering', 'package', 'factory', 'owner', 'Thaddius', 'Thomas', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'Louis', 'unfortunate', 'timing', 'glance', 'Belafonte', 'wife', 'worse', 'Thomas', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'circumstances', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Louis', 'job', 'home', 'mind', 'Blaming', 'boss', 'owed', 'what', 'lost', 'desperate', 'man.He', 'kidnaps', 'Belafonte', 'very', 'upscale', 'home', 'car', 'gunpoint.This', 'film', 'real', 'eye-opener', 'may', 'think', 'understand', 'what', 'inner-city', 'black', 'families', 'minority', 'group', 'feel', 'empathetic', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice.The', 'roles', 'are', 'reversed.Travolta', 'character', 'family', 'are', 'treated', 'very', 'much', 'second', 'third', 'class', 'citizens.Police', 'automatically', 'assume', 'guilt', 'take', 'means', 'want', 'make', 'arrest', 'inner-city', 'mostly', 'inhabited', 'whites', 'portrayed', 'crime', 'infested', 'neighborhoods', 'little', 'white', 'boy', 'watching', 'TV', 'channels', 'almost', 'program', 'commercial', 'are', 'black', 'actors', 'little', 'boy', 'super', 'hero', 'action', 'toy', 'birthday', 'super', 'hero', 'black', 'more', 'expensive', 'then', 'white', 'side', 'kick', 'little', 'boy', 'wont', 'settle', 'less.An', 'elegant', 'fashion', 'show', 'put', 'very', 'wealthy', 'benefit', 'inner-city', 'kids', 'kids', 'are', 'showcased', 'end', 'are', 'white', 'audience', 'dressed', 'nines', 'black.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'completely', 'say', 'everything', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'bad', 'walk', 'life', 'sprinkling', 'whites', 'jobs', 'yield', 'power', 'good', 'look', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'must', 'endure', 'human', 'beings', 'day-to', 'day', 'life', 'not', 'just', 'color..it', 'nature', 'man', 'How', 'will', 'Belafonte', 'character', 'react', 'when', 'desperate', 'escape', 'situation', 'as', 'well', 'matter', 'what', 'color', 'are', 'when', 'faced', 'adversity', 'cast', 'really', 'became', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'Travolta', 'Belafonte', 'were', 'excellent', 'young', 'Andrew', 'Lawrence', 'Magaret', 'Avery', 'Color', 'Purple', 'Tom', 'bower', 'add', 'talents', 'well.Even', 'angry', 'gang', 'members', 'played', 'stunt', 'guys', 'including', 'Tony', 'Zeller', 'were', 'very', 'believable', 'film', 'times', 'may', 'want', 'little', 'more', 'substance', 'then', 'just', 'entertainment.It', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think.It', 'film', 'something', 'say', 'well', 'probably', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'stand', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'rental', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'can', 'find', 'obscure', 'film', '..Laurie']",N/A

I loved it and haven't seen another movie like it, and probably never will; which that in and of itself also says something.The concept seems like it would have been done at least 100 times in America, but no it hasn't; and Travolta and Belafonte got it done right the first time.

Which is to erase people's biases on race and look at the characters all the while opening one self up to the possibility that this is relatable directly to racial issues without feeling like you are being preached to or watching some horrible tragedy that incriminates those of a different race and leaves them feeling embarrassed, harassed, or victimized themselves by a movie.The person I bought the movie from is great also and shipped the movie quickly",5,Perfect parallel RACE movie,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,1071,"['movie', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'plot', 'line', 'own', 'man', 'losing', 'everything', 'trying', 'survive', 'just', 'default', 'movie', 'Blacks', 'are', 'one', 'positions', 'power', 'loved', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'also', 'something.The', 'concept', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'least', '100', 'times', 'America', ""n't"", 'Travolta', 'Belafonte', 'got', 'done', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'race', 'way', 'perspective', 'often', 'silly', 'enough', 'SADLY', 'only', 'cartoons', 'have', 'privilege', 'doing', 'Which', 'erase', 'people', 'biases', 'race', 'look', 'characters', 'while', 'opening', 'one', 'self', 'up', 'possibility', 'relatable', 'directly', 'racial', 'issues', 'feeling', 'are', 'being', 'preached', 'watching', 'horrible', 'tragedy', 'different', 'race', 'feeling', 'embarrassed', 'harassed', 'victimized', 'movie.The', 'person', 'bought', 'movie', 'great', 'also', 'shipped', 'movie', 'quickly']",N/A

Both are excellent actors in their own right. And add to the fact that both are impassioned about messages, this makes it the perfect film vehicle for them to work together in. I see this movie as White Vs. Black, as much as upper class Vs. lower class. But the added change of race reversal makes it more fascinating. In this movie there are only two races, Black and White. Blacks are the powerful majority. They own the businesses, they are the actors you see on TV and in the movies, they are the ones that have super hero dolls made after them, they go on charity junkets with the &quot;poor white kids&quot;, making themselves feel good by pretending to care and help. Behind closed doors, they talk about how the whites really do things to themselves. The whites in this movie are poor, uneducated, trying to avoid work, feel oppressed, and blame race for all of their problems. The occasional white character in power is a &quot;token white&quot;, placed there to meet some kind of quota, not nessicarily because he deserved it. I think that this entire movie is based on role reversal, but it also points out that the problem is not race, as much as it is viewpoint. As long as people see themselves as oppressed, they will be oppressed. The true chains are in the mind, not in the color of the skin. As for the absence of Asian and Hispanic characters, this tells something also. All conversations of race in the US (outside of a few areas like California) talk ONLY about Black and White. There is no Jessie Jackson or Al Sharpton for the Asians and Hispanics. So to many people, these are the &quot;Invisible Minorities&quot;. This was shown in this movie, because these other races did not exist at all. Because nobody stands up and screams for their rights, they are excluded from the movie, because of lower impact. This of course may be unintentional, but it seems to make sense to me. Think of the last time you saw a rally, demonstration, or public speaker talking about how Hispanics and Asians are stepped on. Name one Asian or Hispanic civil rights leader that makes headline news. But this movie is fascinating. Dark, compelling, and worth watching over and over again. Also good to show to people of any race, because it is hard to ignore the hidden truth, and also the lie that is an accepted truth.

43660,A16GGCDUETTTDB,0783115008,T-Man,"[1, 2]","Speaking as a white person, I was quite taken by many aspects of ""White Man's Burden"", a film about an alternate, contemporary America (as far as 1995 is concerned) where White and Black people have switched roles in society.I do not think the director was trying to make this film to ""show Whites how it feels"" nor to ""show Blacks their own faults"". I think he was simply making this film to say, ""What would it look like?""With that question asked, it is clear that the director put much more thought into the background, themes, and imagery, rather than the actual plot. I have to admit, as a white person I was quite struck to see the typical background roles of peaceful joggers, drivers (in nice cars), and wealthy suburbanites filled by Blacks rather than the usual Whites. It was the first time where I actually asked myself how it made Black people feel, usually seeing White people in those roles.The boy who plays John Travolta's son cannot find anyone who looks like him on TV (unless they are being reported as a suspect in a crime, or fill the roles on sit-coms as lazy wise-crackers). When the boy wants a toy for his birthday, he chooses the more expensive black action figure, rather than the white one (a reference to the real-life doll test in which black children wanted the white doll, and felt the black doll was ugly and ""bad""), which speaks to racial self-esteem.Another reversal of roles is found in the inner city, which in this movie, is inhabited by whites, some who exhibit the stereotypes of ""white trash"" or white leather-and-chain-clad punks. It's crime-ridden, many are homeless, and a lot of them either have low self-esteem and they feel very angry about the way they feel they are treated by the black aristocracy. The black police assume guilt and even mistake Travolta's character for a similar looking white suspect, and beat him severely for it. At a charity event fashion show, young little white kids are paraded in front of a crowd of wealthy blacks, as they are thanked for their charity to ""inner city communities"". That part of the movie definitely struck a cord in me, as it seemed almost degrading to have to receive charity like that, knowing that there were white folks who couldn't take care of those kids, and then parade them around like, ""look at these poor children"".As far as the plot, acting, and characters go, well, eek. Harry Belafonte definitely was not the charismatic guy I knew in every day public life. Throughout the whole film, he seemed to almost have a smile on his face, even as John Travolta was car-jacking and kidnapping him. His line delivery has no emotion. John Travolta was basically doing Black Face, just without any black make up. Travolta plays an angry, violent man in this film (once he gets fired and things go bad for him), reinforcing stereotypes about black men. Perhaps, the director was trying to show what being in the underclass does to you, but that is definitely something that could make this film controversial (if it ever did get popular enough). I found it quite unrealistic that Belafonte, in this movie, being a racist, all of a sudden develops some compassion for white people when he is kidnapped by Travolta, offering his family money at the end of the movie. A bit of a leap there for the director.All in all, I think this film can actually do some good for talking about race and race relations in America.",3,"Great concept, so-so delivery",1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,3409,"['Speaking', 'white', 'person', 'was', 'quite', 'taken', 'many', 'aspects', 'White', 'Man', 'Burden', 'film', 'alternate', 'contemporary', 'America', 'as', 'far', '1995', 'concerned', 'where', 'White', 'Black', 'people', 'have', 'switched', 'roles', 'society.I', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'show', 'Blacks', 'own', 'faults', 'think', 'was', 'simply', 'making', 'film', 'say', 'What', 'would', 'look', 'question', 'asked', 'clear', 'director', 'put', 'much', 'more', 'thought', 'background', 'themes', 'imagery', 'rather', 'actual', 'plot', 'have', 'admit', 'white', 'person', 'was', 'quite', 'struck', 'see', 'typical', 'background', 'roles', 'peaceful', 'joggers', 'drivers', 'nice', 'cars', 'wealthy', 'suburbanites', 'filled', 'Blacks', 'rather', 'usual', 'Whites', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'where', 'actually', 'asked', 'how', 'made', 'Black', 'people', 'feel', 'usually', 'seeing', 'White', 'people', 'roles.The', 'boy', 'who', 'John', 'Travolta', 'son', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'anyone', 'who', 'TV', 'are', 'being', 'reported', 'suspect', 'crime', 'fill', 'roles', 'sit-coms', 'lazy', 'wise-crackers', 'When', 'boy', 'toy', 'birthday', 'more', 'expensive', 'black', 'action', 'figure', 'rather', 'white', 'one', 'reference', 'real-life', 'doll', 'test', 'black', 'children', 'wanted', 'white', 'doll', 'felt', 'black', 'doll', 'was', 'ugly', 'bad', 'racial', 'self-esteem.Another', 'reversal', 'roles', 'found', 'inner', 'city', 'movie', 'inhabited', 'whites', 'who', 'exhibit', 'stereotypes', 'white', 'trash', 'white', 'leather-and-chain-clad', 'punks', 'crime-ridden', 'many', 'are', 'homeless', 'lot', 'have', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'feel', 'very', 'angry', 'way', 'feel', 'are', 'treated', 'black', 'aristocracy', 'black', 'police', 'assume', 'guilt', 'even', 'mistake', 'Travolta', 'character', 'similar', 'looking', 'white', 'suspect', 'beat', 'severely', 'charity', 'event', 'fashion', 'show', 'young', 'little', 'white', 'kids', 'are', 'paraded', 'front', 'crowd', 'wealthy', 'blacks', 'are', 'thanked', 'charity', 'inner', 'city', 'communities', 'part', 'movie', 'definitely', 'struck', 'cord', 'seemed', 'almost', 'degrading', 'have', 'receive', 'charity', 'knowing', 'were', 'white', 'folks', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'then', 'parade', 'look', 'poor', 'children', '.As', 'far', 'plot', 'acting', 'characters', 'go', 'well', 'eek', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'definitely', 'was', 'not', 'charismatic', 'guy', 'knew', 'day', 'public', 'life', 'whole', 'film', 'seemed', 'almost', 'have', 'smile', 'face', 'even', 'John', 'Travolta', 'was', 'car-jacking', 'kidnapping', 'line', 'delivery', 'emotion', 'John', 'Travolta', 'was', 'basically', 'doing', 'Black', 'Face', 'just', 'black', 'make', 'up', 'Travolta', 'angry', 'violent', 'man', 'film', 'once', 'fired', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'reinforcing', 'stereotypes', 'black', 'men', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'what', 'being', 'underclass', 'definitely', 'something', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'controversial', 'ever', 'did', 'get', 'popular', 'enough', 'found', 'quite', 'unrealistic', 'Belafonte', 'movie', 'being', 'racist', 'sudden', 'compassion', 'white', 'people', 'when', 'kidnapped', 'Travolta', 'offering', 'family', 'money', 'end', 'movie', 'bit', 'leap', 'there', 'director.All', 'think', 'film', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'good', 'talking', 'race', 'race', 'relations', 'America']",N/A
