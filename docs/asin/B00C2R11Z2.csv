1641564,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00C2R11Z2,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 5]","Yes, I do love a good scare film.  Of course, I'm free to admit that it honestly doesn't take much to scare me these days, but I am partial to good monster movies more than anything else.  What matters most (after caring for the protagonist, of course) is the measures taken to define the monster: there has to be an origin story (not all that involved, just something that clarifies where it all came from), and there has to be a solid reason for the monster to exist for the purposes of the present story.  Anything less?  Well, I just won't tolerate it.  Anything more?  That's a plus because I can be pretty forgiving of creative missteps when it's clear the cast and crew put as much `love' into fashioning their monster as I take in watching it do its nasty business.UNDER THE BED - for all its scars and boils - works very well as a traditional monster movie.  Sure, the origin's a bit sketchy, and the creature's modus operandi remains more than a bit vague.  But - wow - it sure looks solid when it's given something dark and nefarious to do.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Neal Hausman (played by Jonny Weston) has only now found his way back home after a tragedy from two years ago left him emotionally shattered over the death of his mother.  Neal's mistake?  He believed he could fight the monster living under his bed and win.  (Foolish boy!)  His father, Terry (Peter Holden), has moved on, finding happiness in the arms of Angela (a still luminous Musetta Vander), and they've pushed Neal's younger brother, Paul (Gattlin Griffith), to get on with his life.  But Neal finds that the monster is still there, and it's been waiting for his return.  Together, the boys will rise up to face the beast, hoping once and for all to rid their lives of its surly existence.Like those monster movies of yesterday, UNDER THE BED gives its audience a hero - two young ones, actually - to rejoice in.  Some of the more popular, cultish flicks of the 80's put young children in leads, and methinks those are the sentiments director Steven C. Miller was trying to tap into in seizing on Eric Stolze's script.  Add in the estranged father figure and the comely girl-next-door (Kelcie Stranahan), and the formula is indeed complete!And the 90 minute feature goes to great lengths to remind viewers that the boys are constantly `in recovery' from the trauma of their past, which only gets defined significantly through two factors: whatever really happened caused the death of their mother, and it caused a fire that apparently burned down (per their neighbors) more than half of the house.  The house, however, looks perfectly fine - given the size, one wonders how it was all rebuilt to perfection for the purposes of this film - and the monster lives on.Where UNDER THE BED fails is in handling the usual minutiae of the script.  Characters other than the boys - their father, their new mother, the neighbors, etc. - are all one-note creations not even remotely fleshed out beyond their one-note needs: dad needs to constantly be at odds with his boys, mom needs to constantly be trying to show them her version of step-love, the neighbors are constantly turning their nose up at the boys' tales - and a deeper sense of rounded characters could've served to amp up the `small town America' vibe.Also, Stolze's script is littered way too liberally with just plain bad writing.  For example, Neal is told (by his dad) in the opening scenes that winter has finally ended (""snow just came off last week""), yet the trees, brush, and plants are all in full bloom.  At the house party moments later, everyone's in the back yard, dressed for a summer barbecue; yet, the next day, half of the cast members are wearing coats, while others sport short sleeves. (???)  Step-mom Angela - at the house party - somehow plucks a fistful of cash from the pockets of her sundress, telling the boys to go off and celebrate ... to leave the exact party she's throwing for them.  Talk about a curious host!  And what dress has pockets?  And what hostess sends the guests of honor away from their party?It's these kinds of small moments (or small mistakes) that plague the script.  What works is the monster - a bizarre creation that somehow feeds on dead skin cells and creates some shadow dimension under the boys' beds.  Even it gets some half-brained treatment thanks to Stolze's oversight (it apparently takes two forms - one of a skulking, flesh'n'bone demon and that of a wonderfully ghostly combination of dirty laundry - and it never quite seems to follow any discernible rules.As I said, I can be a bit more forgiving than most because I do like monster movies.  I just wish more thought could've produced a smarter monster movie than what Miller delivers.UNDER THE BED (2012) is produced by Site B and Through the Heart.  DVD distribution is being handled through Xlrator Media.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds very solid consistently, and there is a solid handful of terrific in-camera creature effects that make me long for the films of my cinema youth (1970's and 80's).  Sadly, there are no special features to speak of, and that's a big miss for fans of the horror genre: we love our behind-the-scenes shorts, especially when you're dealing with practical effects films as opposed to today's CGI-crapfests.RECOMMENDED.  There's a curious bit of nostalgia for the days of simpler horror films that were populated by neat or nifty ideas, young heroes, and practical in-camera effects work clearly at play in UNDER THE BED.  Eric Stolze's script feels like it's an 80's story made three decades later, and Steven C. Miller's direction almost harkens back to those quieter, gentler days when all it took to scare us was something hidden under the bed.  It ain't perfect - far from it - but there's far more heart and soul in there than a half-dozen modern torture flicks (I'm talking to you, SAW producers) put together.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Xlrator Media provided me with a DVD copy of UNDER THE BED by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,It Came From Our Dirty

1641572,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00C2R11Z2,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","Novice director Steven C. Miller (Silent Night) takes a stab at an R-rated contemporized approach to the classic &#34;monster under my bed&#34; story.  I was generally pleased with Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2011) and The Boogeyman (2005), so why not give this a shot?After years apart following the death of his mother, disheveled and angsty teen Neal (Jonny Weston; John Dies at the End, Taken 3) returns home to live with his father (Peter Holden; Alien Abduction) and younger brother Paulie.  He had been sent away two years ago to &#34;get well&#34; after he burned the house down with his mother in it, defending himself from the monster residing under his bed.  Now that he has returned, he learns his little brother has been tormented by the same demon every night.The notion that an otherworldly monster can magically cross into our dimension through the floor under one specific kid's bed is pretty silly.  Terrifying, in fact.  That it only does so in the dark while you're asleep&#8230;even scarier.  There was so much potential for dark figures and painfully drawn-out tension.  But for some reason I never saw or felt either.  And what about the story&#8230;actually, what exactly is the story?  What drives this monster and how did it get in their house?  Why did it want these boys?  Are there more of these monsters?  Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2011) and The Boogeyman (2005) made at least some effort to explain their monsters, their motivations, their origins and their behavior.  But here, it just seems that this monster came with the house and its abilities and weaknesses seem to change without explanation as the movie persists.  That's really all we get.Not willing to tell their parents this ridiculous story (as they haven't in years past), the two brothers unite to fight this monster.  They arm themselves with flashlights, tape, wire, a power drill and duct tape.  But is this monster really a threat?  Neal was once psychologically tortured and sleep-deprived by this creature.  But that creature had 365 opportunities a year to get the upper hand on a sleeping child and somehow never won!  After Neal left, his younger brother made it 730 consecutive nights unscathed.  If this monster was really in the business of eating children to survive, it clearly would have starved to death by now.  It doesn't seem that menacing.  A clawed hand reaching out from under the bed is scary, YES!  But if it never does anything else&#8230;what's the big deal?I think the filmmakers really thought this movie was scary&#8230;..it wasn't.  Despite their addition of loud music prefacing &#34;SOMETHING SCARY&#34; every time the camera zooms in on something (like, for example, the edge of a menacing bed skirt), I never felt convinced that anyone old enough to buy their own ticket for this movie could possibly be frightened by it.  Sophomoric scare attempts include a shaking washing machine and load noises, loud noises by themselves for no apparent reason, and close-ups of Neal looking at the bed with loud noises.  Noticing a trend here?THEN ALL THE SUDDEN EVERYTHING CHANGED!For over an hour we sit back and wonder why this movie isn't rated PG-13 or even just PG.  Then, after years of going hungry under the bed, the monster suddenly decides to show Neal's family and the audience that it is, in fact, not at all bound to the bed!  Neal and Paulie are next door when the creature arrives and twists off the neighbor kid's head in a gloriously gory display.  There's that R-rating we came for!  When they run back home it follows them and tears their dad's head apart like a food processor.  You hear that?  It just followed them!  Why the Hell did it just stay under the bed all these years?  We went from a lame movie starring a rubber claw under a bed with loud music and no scares to a gore-slathered, slimy creature romp.  The monster itself is actually pretty damned cool looking and the special effects are up to snuff as well.  It looks like an inbred, disfigured Moorlock covered in snot.Why on Earth the director waited so long to reveal this creature, the action and the gore is beyond me because all of the exposition leading up to this was completely empty and the other characters--the parents, the neighbors, some random love interest that never goes anywhere--really never offered anything to the story, which never made any sense to begin with beyond the simple fact that inexplicably there is a child-hungry monster under Paulie's bed.If things weren't random enough yet, the monster actually fashions a hunter's rope snare, traps Paulie like an animal and drags him into the under-the-bed slimy Netherworld!  So, just like in Poltergeist II (1986), Neal ties a rope around his waist and goes after him armed with a flashlight trident.  I can't even believe what I'm writing right now!  WTF is going on in this movie?  Were the writers all high?  When they come back to--ummmm&#8230;reality I guess--the monster now literally has the ability to teleport before our eyes like Nightcrawler in X-Men.  Hooray consistency!  Then Neal is about to lose a fight against our under-the-bed teleporting Netherworld snot monster when he discovers that his dead mother's ashes are its one weakness.  Yeah!  He throws his mother's ashes on the monster and that's what kills it!After a slow, confusing start this film eventually catapults its audience into a tumultuous spin cycle of bonkers gore, creature effects and action which--despite making no sense whatsoever--make the whole experience worth the price of admission.  In fact, the last 20 minutes were so off-the-wall entertaining that I don't regret buying this at all.  Yes it's very dumb.  But it's the kind of dumb I want to share with friends with an improvised drinking game.Enjoy the madness.",3,"A senseless story and slow at the start, but the bonkers gory creature-tastic third act

The conversation they have is vague, but it is clear that a) the boy has been staying with an aunt for a couple years ever since he caused some kind of horrible accident at home, b) his relationship with his father is strained at best, and c) he has a younger brother named ""Paulie"" that he misses and worries about. He gets home, and as soon as he sees his old house, his eyes widen and his face locks in a sort of sexy-ish version of freaked out (get used to this facial expression), the camera zooms in on him and zooms in on the house and zooms in on him and tilts at a threatening angle and you hear a bunch of brass instruments (tubas and the like) bellow a bombastic ""BWAAAAAAAARRRRRMMMMM!"" in the soundtrack, letting viewers know that this is scary. This house. Or something.He has some of the world's most awkward conversations with some of the world's flattest characters, giving them all a hearty dose of barely-strained surliness before he decides to go into the house to see Paulie. He steps up to the entrance to the door. His eyes grow dark and wide and freaked out, the camera frames him in a bad boy pose as he hesitates before the entrance, and the soundtrack clobbers you with another ""BWAAAAAAAARRRRRRRMMMMMM!""This kind of thing happens, by my count, another twenty to fifty times. I can see why the filmmakers did it. It is very addictive. Whenever I do anything in my apartment now, I scream, ""BWAAAAAARRRRRRMMMMM!"" to preface it. I open the cabinet for some soup? ""BWAAAAAARRRRRRMMMMM!"" I get out the can opener? ""BWAAAAAARRRRRMMMMM!"" It drives my girlfriend up the wall.This movie thinks it's scary, and it lets you know from frame one. It is not. It barely even makes sense. Neil and Paulie are afraid of some kind of bloodthirsty, otherworldly creature that lives under Neil's bed. Where did it come from? What does it want? To what rules does its universe adhere? Who knows! Certainly not the movie. There are hints here and there, but mostly it's just bizarre pointlessness that crumbles under the slightest analysis, like some kind of ultra-buttery Jenga stack.It's not just the creature that makes no sense. Our father character goes nuts like a prison hoe-down at the drop of a hat. Neil seems to have some kind of split personality disorder, and the script can't decide what age Paulie is supposed to be. Other characters -- the bullies, the love interest, the step mother -- may as well just be cardboard cutouts with articulated jaws.When the monster finally stops playing peek-a-boo and starts getting all up in everyone's faces, the film gets the burst of energy and ""holy crap!""-itude that it has wanted to have from the first BWAAAAAAARRRRRRRRMMMMMMMM! Of course, the monster's sudden attack of moxie also doesn't make any sense given the meager exposition we've been fed, but by that point you're likely not to care, grateful just to be spared another excruciatingly vague conversation or completely out-of-the-blue familial yelling match. The heck-raising doesn't last long, though, and it is aborted -- true to form -- in ludicrous, head-scratching style, with not even a smidgen of closure. You'd think out of respect to the audience that they'd reveal something to tie up one of the dozens of loose ends, or fill in just a few of the massive logical gaps, but nope.Although, to be fair, the final shot of the movie DOES have an extra long BWWWAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRMMMMMMM! over it, so I guess you take what you can get.",1,BWAAAAAAARRRRRRRRMMMMMMMM!,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,3541,"['film', 'surly', 'teen', 'Neil', 'being', 'driven', 'father', 'back', 'home', 'conversation', 'have', 'vague', 'clear', 'boy', 'been', 'staying', 'aunt', 'couple', 'years', 'ever', 'caused', 'kind', 'horrible', 'accident', 'home', 'b', 'relationship', 'father', 'strained', 'best', 'c', 'younger', 'brother', 'named', 'Paulie', 'worries', 'home', 'as', 'soon', 'old', 'house', 'eyes', 'widen', 'face', 'locks', 'sort', 'sexy-ish', 'version', 'freaked', 'out', 'get', 'used', 'facial', 'expression', 'camera', 'zooms', 'house', 'zooms', 'tilts', 'threatening', 'angle', 'hear', 'bunch', 'brass', 'instruments', 'tubas', 'like', 'bombastic', 'BWAAAAAAAARRRRRMMMMM', 'soundtrack', 'letting', 'viewers', 'know', 'scary', 'house', 'something.He', 'world', 'most', 'awkward', 'conversations', 'world', 'flattest', 'characters', 'giving', 'hearty', 'dose', 'barely-strained', 'surliness', 'go', 'house', 'see', 'Paulie', 'up', 'entrance', 'door', 'eyes', 'grow', 'dark', 'wide', 'freaked', 'out', 'camera', 'bad', 'boy', 'pose', 'entrance', 'soundtrack', 'clobbers', 'BWAAAAAAAARRRRRRRMMMMMM', 'kind', 'thing', 'happens', 'count', 'twenty', 'fifty', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'very', 'addictive', 'Whenever', 'do', 'anything', 'apartment', 'now', 'scream', 'BWAAAAAARRRRRRMMMMM', 'preface', 'open', 'cabinet', 'soup', 'BWAAAAAARRRRRRMMMMM', 'get', 'can', 'opener', 'BWAAAAAARRRRRMMMMM', 'girlfriend', 'up', 'wall.This', 'movie', 'scary', 'know', 'frame', 'one', 'not', 'barely', 'even', 'sense', 'Neil', 'Paulie', 'are', 'afraid', 'kind', 'bloodthirsty', 'otherworldly', 'creature', 'Neil', 'bed', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'What', 'want', 'what', 'rules', 'universe', 'adhere', 'Who', 'Certainly', 'not', 'movie', 'are', 'hints', 'here', 'there', 'mostly', 'just', 'bizarre', 'pointlessness', 'slightest', 'analysis', 'kind', 'ultra-buttery', 'Jenga', 'stack.It', 'not', 'just', 'creature', 'sense', 'father', 'character', 'nuts', 'prison', 'hoe-down', 'drop', 'hat', 'Neil', 'have', 'kind', 'split', 'personality', 'disorder', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'age', 'Paulie', 'supposed', 'be', 'Other', 'characters', 'bullies', 'love', 'interest', 'step', 'mother', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'be', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'articulated', 'jaws.When', 'monster', 'finally', 'playing', 'peek-a-boo', 'getting', 'up', 'everyone', 'film', 'burst', 'energy', 'holy', 'crap', '-itude', 'wanted', 'have', 'first', 'BWAAAAAAARRRRRRRRMMMMMMMM', 'course', 'monster', 'sudden', 'attack', 'moxie', 'also', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'given', 'meager', 'exposition', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fed', 'point', ""'re"", 'likely', 'not', 'care', 'grateful', 'just', 'be', 'spared', 'excruciatingly', 'vague', 'conversation', 'completely', 'out-of-the-blue', 'familial', 'yelling', 'match', 'heck-raising', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'though', 'aborted', 'true', 'form', 'ludicrous', 'head-scratching', 'style', 'not', 'even', 'smidgen', 'closure', ""'d"", 'think', 'respect', 'audience', ""'d"", 'reveal', 'something', 'tie', 'up', 'one', 'dozens', 'loose', 'ends', 'fill', 'just', 'few', 'massive', 'logical', 'gaps', 'nope.Although', 'be', 'fair', 'final', 'shot', 'movie', 'DOES', 'have', 'extra', 'long', 'BWWWAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRMMMMMMM', 'so', 'guess', 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get']",Under the Bed

Really?  Seriously?  &#34;Under the Bed&#34; is one of the WORST horror movies I've seen in years.  Watching it, I had the suspicion that many scenes, scenes of exposition or explanation, ended up on the cutting room floor, because so many of the scenes that remain seem ludicrously short of reason or motive.  A perfect example is the scene in which the stepmother heads to the washer/dryer in the garage to do laundry and has an encounter with the thing from under the bed - then NEVER even mentions it afterward.  Another is the whole character of the father and his methodology to get the kids to behave.  Lock them in their rooms and unscrew the lightbulb in the ceiling!  THEN we'll have a scary encounter with the thing from under the bed...  The neighbors?  The thing from under the bed heading on over there only to provide the movie with a scene of horror?Ludicrous plot.  Ludicrous direction.  Ludicrous performances.

He is coming home with his less than understanding father (Peter Holden) to reunite with his younger brother Paulie (Gattlin Griffith) and meet his new step mother Angela (Musetta Vander). As the film progresses we find out more about the fire incident and the thing that lives under the bed.I liked how they did the horror and creep factor in the film. It didn't come at you constantly so you didn't get numb to it. There were a number of things that made me scratch my head.1) Neal was gone for 2 years. Paulie was 3 when he left. He is clearly well older than 5, more like 10 or 11.2) Angela experiences an early encounter, then acts like nothing happened.3) Paulie has been sleeping in the same room as this thing for years which seems absurd.4) Dad forces them to sleep in the haunted room to prove a point.I felt like there were some missing scenes.
