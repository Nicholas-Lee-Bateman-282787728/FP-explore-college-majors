1693397,ACSEUE5VAJIPQ,B00I4581F4,grant18,"[0, 0]","China Beach was the critics' choice for best television drama at its time but never was able to get decent ratings.  As a Vietnam combat vet, I find situations I relate to & situations that approach incredulity.  The third season seems to have turned toward more stock plots (love stories, mysteries, etc.) but it does have some tense episodes (even if unlikely) such as McMurphy being kidnapped then released by the Viet Cong.  I loved it, you may hate it - but the war's over & the overriding plot line of women being able to rise to what was always considered only men's level of courage in the worst of times is still (and will always be) relevant.  If you were there, it's nostalgic.  If you weren't there, consider yourself lucky.",5,Love it or hate it,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,736,"['China', 'Beach', 'was', 'critics', 'choice', 'best', 'television', 'drama', 'time', 'never', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'decent', 'ratings', 'Vietnam', 'combat', 'vet', 'find', 'situations', 'relate', 'situations', 'approach', 'incredulity', 'third', 'season', 'have', 'turned', 'more', 'stock', 'plots', 'love', 'stories', 'mysteries', 'etc', 'have', 'tense', 'episodes', 'even', 'unlikely', 'such', 'McMurphy', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'then', 'released', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'loved', 'may', 'hate', 'war', 'overriding', 'plot', 'line', 'women', 'being', 'able', 'rise', 'what', 'was', 'always', 'considered', 'only', 'men', 'level', 'courage', 'worst', 'times', 'still', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'relevant', 'were', 'there', 'nostalgic', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'consider', 'lucky']",China Beach: Season 3
