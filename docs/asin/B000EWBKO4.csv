I even wrote DIC entertainment 4 years ago to find out when ALF Tales and The ALF animated series would be released.  There was no answer.  Now my prayers have been answered.  It may sound like hyperbole, but the ALF cartoons rank with Rocky & Bullwinkle and other Jay Ward/Bill Scott creations - Fractured Fairy Tales, Mr. Peabody, Dudley Do-Right, George of the Jungle, et al - as some of the funniest cartoons ever created.  Not in the same genre as cartoons from the golden age of the movie studios - MGM, Tex Avery, Warner Bros. etc. - but of same limited animation as R&B where story and dialog count as the essential elements, these mini-masterpieces have done more than achieve a high level of hilarious, dead-on satire, but have also captured the spirit of the time in which they were created.",5,Finally!,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,843,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'wrote', 'DIC', 'entertainment', '4', 'years', 'ago', 'find', 'out', 'when', 'ALF', 'Tales', 'ALF', 'animated', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'was', 'answer', 'Now', 'prayers', 'have', 'been', 'answered', 'may', 'sound', 'hyperbole', 'ALF', 'cartoons', 'rank', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'other', 'Jay', 'Ward/Bill', 'Scott', 'creations', 'Fractured', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'Mr.', 'Peabody', 'Dudley', 'Do-Right', 'George', 'Jungle', 'et', 'al', 'funniest', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'created', 'Not', 'same', 'genre', 'cartoons', 'golden', 'age', 'movie', 'studios', 'MGM', 'Tex', 'Avery', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'etc', 'same', 'limited', 'animation', 'R', 'B', 'where', 'story', 'dialog', 'count', 'essential', 'elements', 'mini-masterpieces', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'achieve', 'high', 'level', 'hilarious', 'dead-on', 'satire', 'have', 'also', 'captured', 'spirit', 'time', 'were', 'created']","Alf Animated Adventures: 20,000 Years In Driving School"

It heralded the start of the school year and a new season of Saturday morning cartoons. I could hardly wait for the premier of the new fall lineup but year after year I found myself disappointed. We kids were fed a steady diet of low quality programming like Teen Wolf, The Snorks and Kissyfur. Then, in 1987 something magical happened. Starting at 10:00 AM children were presented with a solid hour and a half of creative, well produced programming including Pee-Wee's Playhouse, Ralph Bakshi's Mighty Mouse and Alf: The Animated Series. In a cruel twist of fate, the second season of Alf was pitted against another high quality cartoon, Slimer and the Real Ghostbusters on ABC as well as the second season of Pee Wee on CBS. In the end Alf usually won my attention until reruns started and then I switched to the Ghostbusters or Pee Wee. This was probably the peak of Saturday morning cartooning as far as I was concerned.After more than 20 years Alf: TAS still holds up. I was surprised at how well I remembered details of episodes, right down to specific lines of dialog. The animation is organic, energetic and colorful and the writing is top notch for its day. It definitely has a late 80's feel to it but the creators really went all out to produce a fully realized Melmac (home planet of Alf). The supporting characters are great and Alf: TAS manages to do something so rare in cartoons. It's actually legitimately funny. What I can't deny is that the animated series has pretty much dropped from the public consciousness. It only survived two seasons (which is one more than most Saturday morning cartoons) before being completely revamped as the lamentable Alf Tales and then cancellation.In rating DVD's I tend to weigh almost all my calculations on the feature presentation with little to none on the quality of the packaging, transfer or special features but I have to say that '20,000 Years in Driving School' is the bare bones minimum. No special features whatsoever, only nine episodes chosen randomly from the full 26 and some rather mediocre transfers. My understanding is that Lions Gate released this cheapie collection to test the market interest which turned out to be lackluster. It's too bad because Alf is a terrific cartoon. If this is the best I can get I'll have to live with it but I for one would rush to get all 26 episodes if they ever become available and hopefully they'll pull together some better transfers. When it gets right down to it the DVD is priced low and if it helps Lions Gate or some other company decides to release all the episodes then I'm happy to spend 10 bucks.",4,Even Better than the Original Show,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,2709,"['When', 'was', 'young', 'fall', 'season', 'meant', 'two', 'things', 'falling', 'leaves', 'carving', 'pumpkins', 'heralded', 'start', 'school', 'year', 'new', 'season', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'premier', 'new', 'fall', 'lineup', 'year', 'year', 'found', 'disappointed', 'kids', 'were', 'fed', 'steady', 'diet', 'low', 'quality', 'programming', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'Snorks', 'Kissyfur', 'Then', '1987', 'something', 'magical', 'happened', 'Starting', '10:00', 'AM', 'children', 'were', 'presented', 'solid', 'hour', 'half', 'creative', 'well', 'produced', 'programming', 'including', 'Pee-Wee', 'Playhouse', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'Mighty', 'Mouse', 'Alf', 'Animated', 'Series', 'cruel', 'twist', 'fate', 'second', 'season', 'Alf', 'was', 'pitted', 'high', 'quality', 'cartoon', 'Slimer', 'Real', 'Ghostbusters', 'ABC', 'as', 'well', 'second', 'season', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'CBS', 'end', 'Alf', 'usually', 'won', 'attention', 'reruns', 'started', 'then', 'switched', 'Ghostbusters', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'was', 'probably', 'peak', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartooning', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned.After', 'more', '20', 'years', 'Alf', 'TAS', 'still', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'remembered', 'details', 'episodes', 'right', 'down', 'specific', 'lines', 'dialog', 'animation', 'organic', 'energetic', 'colorful', 'writing', 'top', 'notch', 'day', 'definitely', 'late', '80', 'feel', 'creators', 'really', 'went', 'produce', 'fully', 'realized', 'Melmac', 'home', 'planet', 'Alf', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'Alf', 'TAS', 'manages', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'rare', 'cartoons', 'actually', 'legitimately', 'funny', 'What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'animated', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'dropped', 'public', 'consciousness', 'only', 'survived', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'more', 'most', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'being', 'completely', 'revamped', 'lamentable', 'Alf', 'Tales', 'then', 'cancellation.In', 'rating', 'DVD', 'tend', 'weigh', 'almost', 'calculations', 'feature', 'presentation', 'little', 'none', 'quality', 'packaging', 'transfer', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'say', ""'20,000"", 'Years', 'Driving', 'School', 'bare', 'minimum', 'special', 'features', 'whatsoever', 'only', 'nine', 'episodes', 'chosen', 'randomly', 'full', '26', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'transfers', 'understanding', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'released', 'cheapie', 'collection', 'test', 'market', 'interest', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'lackluster', 'too', 'bad', 'Alf', 'terrific', 'cartoon', 'best', 'can', 'get', ""'ll"", 'have', 'live', 'one', 'would', 'rush', 'get', '26', 'episodes', 'ever', 'become', 'available', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'pull', 'together', 'better', 'transfers', 'When', 'right', 'down', 'DVD', 'priced', 'low', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'other', 'company', 'release', 'episodes', 'then', ""'m"", 'happy', 'spend', '10', 'bucks']","Alf Animated Adventures: 20,000 Years In Driving School"

The environments and characters are very alien and still familiar enough to get you to identify with the humor.  There is some slapstick reminiscent of the old ""Loony Toons"" cartoons with a little ""Three Stooges"" thrown in.  THIS IS DEFINATELY ""KID SAFE"", and fun for parents to watch too.
