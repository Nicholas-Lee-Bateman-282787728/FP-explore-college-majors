961483,A27T7FAONDX6VI,B000CRR33I,"Chris ""Chris906""","[0, 0]","'The Color of War' is a amazing series on the American Experience in World War II that the History Channel did in 2001-2002. This DVD contains all of the episodes. The transfer and sound quality is top notch. This was the old History Channel at their best.The footage in color is amazing and well chosen. There does seem to be more Pacific War footage than the European War. The voiceovers are excellently done and are very moving. The thematic nature of the show really works in its favor, also. I like how particular subjects are dealt with instead of the show being in strict chronological order. I think what makes the series engrossing is that there is only the footage, a Narrator (Actor Peter Coyote doing a splendid job), and the words of the people involved. There are no historians commenting that would create another layer between the viewer and the visceral nature of the program and the viewer.There are powerful episodes such as on Medical care (which contains graphic footage) that shows the true horror of 'The Last Good War'. Also, the episodes on those that covered the war is a great tribute to intrepid reporters and cameramen. Truly unbelievable are the actual reports featured on the episodes that you can hear the crackle of gunfire in the background as the reporters speak. The Air War is excellently portrayed and the sheer awesomeness of the larger than life Naval battles that were fought in Pacific.You will be brought to cheers and completely moved by the efforts of Men and Women of the United States to win such a truly horrific and important war.I recommend this series highly. I think that 'The Color of War' is a excellent companion to other documentaries on the war like the legendary 'World at War'.Definitely purchase this box set if you are a World War II or American history student. If you are not either purchase it all the same. You will not be disappointed!A+++",5,Excellent view of World War II,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,1905,"['Color', 'War', 'amazing', 'series', 'American', 'Experience', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'History', 'Channel', 'did', '2001-2002', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'transfer', 'sound', 'quality', 'top', 'notch', 'was', 'old', 'History', 'Channel', 'best.The', 'footage', 'color', 'amazing', 'well', 'chosen', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'Pacific', 'War', 'footage', 'European', 'War', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'excellently', 'done', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'thematic', 'nature', 'show', 'really', 'favor', 'also', 'how', 'particular', 'subjects', 'are', 'dealt', 'instead', 'show', 'being', 'strict', 'chronological', 'order', 'think', 'what', 'series', 'engrossing', 'only', 'footage', 'Narrator', 'Actor', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'doing', 'splendid', 'job', 'words', 'people', 'involved', 'are', 'historians', 'commenting', 'would', 'create', 'layer', 'viewer', 'visceral', 'nature', 'program', 'viewer.There', 'are', 'powerful', 'episodes', 'such', 'Medical', 'care', 'graphic', 'footage', 'true', 'horror', ""'The"", 'Last', 'Good', 'War', 'Also', 'episodes', 'covered', 'war', 'great', 'tribute', 'intrepid', 'reporters', 'cameramen', 'Truly', 'unbelievable', 'are', 'actual', 'reports', 'featured', 'episodes', 'can', 'hear', 'crackle', 'gunfire', 'background', 'reporters', 'speak', 'Air', 'War', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'sheer', 'awesomeness', 'larger', 'life', 'Naval', 'were', 'fought', 'Pacific.You', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'cheers', 'completely', 'moved', 'efforts', 'Men', 'Women', 'United', 'States', 'win', 'such', 'truly', 'horrific', 'important', 'war.I', 'recommend', 'series', 'highly', 'think', 'Color', 'War', 'excellent', 'companion', 'other', 'documentaries', 'war', 'legendary', ""'World"", ""War'.Definitely"", 'purchase', 'box', 'set', 'are', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'American', 'history', 'student', 'are', 'not', 'either', 'purchase', 'same', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'A+++']",The History Channel Presents The Color of War

This color film of the war shows the true horrors of the war that yes even killed children. This is truth and you see it in your face from these war reporters as it happened. The war has been glamorized for years and has had sugar poured over it to lessen its horrors.i am a person who looks for truth no matter how perverted,disgusting, or beautiful it may be.

961488,A12LH2100CKQO,B000CRR33I,God is a refuge for us (Psalms 62:8),"[4, 4]","The producers limited this documentary to ""color only"" footage.  This means that the stories they tell are less complete than they could have been if they had used both color and black/white footage.Instead of covering places or battles or events in detail, the documentary is split into war topics (see the list of episodes at the end of my review). Do you want to learn about what happened at Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge, or the Philippines?  You won't get that with this DVD set.  You may hear bits and pieces about some of these places/battles in several episodes.Some documentaries that cover WWII (ones that use color and black/white footage) concentrate on places/battles/events; they not only show more complete footage, but their narration/explanation of what is occurring in the footage is more complete.Every episode had a theme, yet they still lacked focus; almost every episode either bounced around from theater to theater or spanned the entire war period (or both) in one 45 minute episode.There were no veteran interviews. That was disappointing. Instead, ""the voices of soldiers, commanders, and civilians come to life through letters, diaries and battlefield communiques.""Some of the footage was repeated among the episodes.  Most of the footage was new to me.  Some of the footage was familiar (also shown in other documentaries).Despite some of these negatives, I thought the series was worthwhile.  There was footage that I have not seen before, and I learned things from the narrative.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collectionsHere is a list of the episodes:DVD #1Into the BreachFace to FaceAir War and BattlegroundDVD #2At EaseAnchors AweighWhy We FightDVD #3Fueling the FireSilent and DeepHomefrontThe Price of WarDVD #4VictoryAftermathMan and MachineDVD #5Clearing the WayCovering WarDressed to Kill",4,"lots of good color footage, but...",1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,1922,"['producers', 'limited', 'documentary', 'color', 'only', 'footage', 'stories', 'tell', 'are', 'less', 'complete', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'used', 'color', 'black/white', 'footage.Instead', 'covering', 'places', 'battles', 'events', 'detail', 'documentary', 'split', 'war', 'topics', 'see', 'list', 'episodes', 'end', 'review', 'Do', 'want', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'Normandy', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'Philippines', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'DVD', 'set', 'may', 'hear', 'bits', 'pieces', 'places/battles', 'several', 'episodes.Some', 'documentaries', 'cover', 'WWII', 'ones', 'use', 'color', 'black/white', 'footage', 'concentrate', 'places/battles/events', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'more', 'complete', 'footage', 'narration/explanation', 'what', 'occurring', 'footage', 'more', 'complete.Every', 'episode', 'had', 'theme', 'yet', 'still', 'lacked', 'focus', 'almost', 'episode', 'bounced', 'theater', 'theater', 'spanned', 'entire', 'war', 'period', 'one', '45', 'minute', 'were', 'veteran', 'interviews', 'was', 'disappointing', 'Instead', 'voices', 'soldiers', 'commanders', 'come', 'life', 'letters', 'diaries', 'battlefield', 'communiques', 'footage', 'was', 'repeated', 'episodes', 'Most', 'footage', 'was', 'new', 'footage', 'was', 'familiar', 'also', 'shown', 'other', 'documentaries', '.Despite', 'negatives', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'was', 'footage', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'learned', 'things', 'narrative.Visit', 'Amazon', 'Collections', 'see', '4-star', '5-star', 'military/war', 'DVDs', 'http', 'list', 'episodes', 'DVD', '1Into', 'BreachFace', 'FaceAir', 'War', 'BattlegroundDVD', '2At', 'EaseAnchors', 'AweighWhy', 'FightDVD', '3Fueling', 'FireSilent', 'DeepHomefrontThe', 'Price', 'WarDVD', '4VictoryAftermathMan', 'MachineDVD', '5Clearing', 'WayCovering', 'WarDressed', 'Kill']",The History Channel Presents The Color of War
