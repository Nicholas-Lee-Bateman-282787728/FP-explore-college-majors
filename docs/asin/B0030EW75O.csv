1315411,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B0030EW75O,Amit Talpade,"[0, 0]","Based on a book by Madhu Rye `Kimball Ravenswood' this movie looks at matrimony in a interesting manner but the execution falls short. One cannot simple blame the length because Ashutosh Gowariker is known for his long slogs. Anyone remember Lagaan, Swades and most recently Jodhaa Akbar, all clocked at 3 hours plus. The story is of Yogesh who is a NRI living in Chicago who is called to India on the pretext that his father has had a heart attack. Upon arrival he is given a deadline to get married, because his marriage will save the family from ruin and the date has been fixed but the girl is not. Yogesh decides that he would see 12 girls of 12 different sun signs. These 12 girls are played by Priyanka Chopra and they give insights in to matrimony and its societal aspects such as virginity, child marriage, illiteracy. Interesting concept but does not come across well on the screen. So there are 12 Raashees and thus 12 stories. The movie has uneven spacing and some scenes are better than the other. Priyanka does this challenging role justice and Harman has a nice screen presence. The songs are melodious. I did not agree with the choice of the girl at the end but hey....The parallel tracks of Harman's father employing a spy and the money lender with his goons are boring...I gave it three stars. 1/18/10",3,An Ok adaptation,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,1319,"['Based', 'book', 'Madhu', 'Rye', 'Kimball', 'Ravenswood', 'movie', 'matrimony', 'interesting', 'manner', 'execution', 'short', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'simple', 'blame', 'length', 'Ashutosh', 'Gowariker', 'known', 'long', 'slogs', 'Anyone', 'remember', 'Lagaan', 'Swades', 'most', 'recently', 'Jodhaa', 'Akbar', 'clocked', '3', 'hours', 'story', 'Yogesh', 'who', 'NRI', 'living', 'Chicago', 'who', 'called', 'India', 'pretext', 'father', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'arrival', 'given', 'deadline', 'get', 'married', 'marriage', 'will', 'save', 'family', 'ruin', 'date', 'been', 'fixed', 'girl', 'not', 'Yogesh', 'would', 'see', '12', 'girls', '12', 'different', 'sun', 'signs', '12', 'girls', 'are', 'played', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', 'give', 'insights', 'matrimony', 'societal', 'aspects', 'such', 'virginity', 'child', 'marriage', 'illiteracy', 'Interesting', 'concept', 'not', 'come', 'across', 'well', 'screen', 'are', '12', 'Raashees', 'thus', '12', 'stories', 'movie', 'uneven', 'spacing', 'scenes', 'are', 'better', 'other', 'Priyanka', 'challenging', 'role', 'justice', 'Harman', 'nice', 'screen', 'presence', 'songs', 'are', 'melodious', 'did', 'not', 'agree', 'choice', 'girl', 'end', 'hey', 'parallel', 'tracks', 'Harman', 'father', 'employing', 'spy', 'money', 'lender', 'goons', 'are', 'boring', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', '1/18/10']",What's Your Raashee ?
1315412,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0030EW75O,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[8, 8]","I really, really liked this movie, even if it went on so long I had a birthday. WHAT'S YOUR RAASHEE? runs at 3 hours and 33 minutes, but what do you expect from director Ashutosh Gowariker, whose previous films (LAGAAN, SWADES, JODHAA AKBAR) were of the ""epic"" persuasion? I could see why the movie's length would get people restless in the theater and why this didn't do too well in the box office. Certainly, watching it at home on DVD makes for a more enjoyable experience. WHAT'S YOUR RAASHEE (""What's Your Sign?"") strays away from this director's mold in that it's a romantic comedy, something which Gowariker had been raring to do. This film also reunites Priyanka Chopra with Harman Baweja after LOVE STORY 2050. Except that this one is lots better and comes loaded with many funny moments.It is foretold that, upon his wedding day, young Yogesh Patel will inherit untold riches. When Yogesh's grandfather decides to leave him all his wealth and property, but only on the day Yogesh gets married, it's the ideal way to get Yogesh's troubled family out of financial straits. But his brother's running afoul of an underworld don in Mumbai imposes a deadline, and now Yogesh has only ten days to make himself a match. He desperately hits on a silly brainstorm, which is to meet one girl from each raashee - a sign from the horoscope - thus giving himself twelve chances, twelve girls to pick from and hopefully one to fall in love with.Taking in the jazzy-cool opening song, I had a sense that this movie was going to go down nice and smooth. WHAT'S YOUR RAASHEE? has something to say about marriage, the perceptions and traditions and restrictions surrounding that institution as held in India. But, because these viewpoints are touched on in scenes that are basically vignettes and mostly couched in humor, things don't get too heavy-handed before we move on to the next beat. Which leads us to the film's interesting conceit.Harman Baweja is solid and there's even that faint echo of Hrithik Roshan about him, from certain angles. But you have to really give it up for Priyanka Chopra who takes on twelve roles. According to Yogesh's grandfather, when a youth seeks the girl of his dreams, he sees that one ideal face in all the girls he meets, and this pretty much explains away the implausibility of all twelve girls looking like Priyanka. I do think it's actually a smart move to have one actress play all twelve roles, as opposed to twelve different actresses. Priyanka lends a continuity thru the story arc whereas various actresses milling around would probably have made it all too confusing. But Priyanka is terrific and, it turns out, a very fine light comedienne. She invests each of her characters with a distinctive persona, utilizing various mannerisms and looks and stances - I honestly didn't recognize her in her last role. You can easily tell them apart, and this is never more evident - and a testament to all the work that Priyanka put in - than in the musical number ""What's Your Raashee? (Chehre Jo Dekhe Hain),"" in which Yogesh interacts with all the twelve girls and where the sweet but unpolished Anjali remains awkward up until the very end (it's a nice touch that she mistimes the song's big finale move).Perhaps because there aren't enough characters in the film (heh), two running side stories are also introduced. Yogesh's father hires a private detective to trail Yogesh. And occasionally those two thugs pop up to make ominous remarks and to remind Yogesh and his brother of the debt owed to their don. Thankfully, both subplots don't really get in the way of the core story.I like that the film doesn't go the predictable route by making it an easy choice for Yogesh. There's really no horrific choice here (okay, the fifteen-year-old is not an option, and that business woman is perhaps too scary intimidating), and so you're kept guessing. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the viewers share differing opinions as to with whom Yogesh should've ended up. I thought there were at least five very viable candidates.The thirteen songs probably take up nearly an hour of the film's running time, but the nice surprise is that just about each track is very good. There are wonderfully melodic ballads like ""Pyaari Pyaari"" (Pooja's song), the melancholy ""Bikhri Bikhri"" (Hansa's song, and the one which Priyanka, Harman, and the director have admitted as their favorite), and ""Jao Na"" (Sanjana's song, and a romantic sequence that made Sanjana the early frontrunner for me). ""Maanunga Maanunga"" is Rajni's song, and it's funny. ""Aa Le Chal,"" Nandini's song and set in Chicago, has got an infectious hook. ""Su Chhe,"" Vishaka's song, and ""What's Your Raashee? (Chehre Jo Dekhe Hain)"" are just really fun and playful with the latter song featuring Yogesh dancing with all twelve girls and you hear fleeting strains of the previous tracks.This DVD set has three discs, the very long feature film broken up between the first two discs with English sub-titles and an option for song selection. Disc three offers up the following bonus stuff, most of which is in English:- ""Shri Madhu Rye Interview"" (he wrote KIMBALL RAVENSWOOD, the novel the film is based on; this interview is around 5 minutes long)- ""Harman and Priyanka Interviewed By Ashutosh Gowariker"" - a fun, relaxed conversation amongst the three (21 minutes)- ""Harman and Priyanka Speak On WHAT'S YOUR RAASHEE?"" - Harman & Priyanka break down Priyanka's twelve roles (22 minutes)- ""Priyanka Chopra's 12 Look Tests"" - we get brief samples of the photo shoots that went on for Priyanka's twelve looks, as well as several shots of Harman looking dapper (4 minutes)- ""Know Your Raashee"" - This is kinda cool; This is a horoscope wheel from which you can click on any of the twelve zodiacs to learn each sign's respective traits- 6 Deleted Scenes (no sub-titles, totaling 7 minutes, 22 seconds)- Song Lyrics to all 13 songs (with a sweet option for English translation)- Promos for the film",5,"""Jesus, man!

1315413,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B0030EW75O,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[2, 3]","Bollywood movies are long--for good reason. The time commitment required of the audience heightens their emotional investment in the story. (The same is true of operas, which are often as long or even longer than Hindi films.) The effect can be powerfully moving, even for Americans accustomed to shorter films. What's Your Rashee?, a tedious romantic comedy with a run time of three hours and 25 minutes, is not an example of Bollywood's artful use of length, but an unpleasant test of endurance.The premise of the film is interesting--one actress, the talented Priyanka Chopra, plays 12 different characters, one for each zodiac sign, or rashee. But that's several characters too many to explore in one film. Chopra doesn't even appear until a full half hour into it, and by then, the audience has suffered too much of her milquetoast co-star, Harman Baweja, to care which one of her avatars (each with a distinct personality and hairstyle) ends up with his character, Yogesh. At some point, you'll start counting how many more signs are left (I began keeping track at six).Yogesh is a student at the University of Chicago. His brother back in Mumbai is involved in a financial scam and must pay restitution, and he also owes a large sum to the mob. His desperate parents consult an astrologer, who tells them Yogesh will get married in 10 days and acquire vast wealth on that day, thereby solving all their money problems. Yogesh's grandfather--who knows nothing about the prediction--fulfills it by deciding to give his entire estate to Yogesh as a wedding gift. The family summons Yogesh home and tells him he's got 10 days to find a bride. He doesn't want to marry under these conditions, but agrees to do it for his brother's sake. Yogesh is a simple man and he believes there are only 12 types of people in the world, according to the zodiac, so he decides to meet one woman from each sign and pick the one he likes best. He goes out with an unsophisticated Aries, a beautiful Aquarian, a bubbly Gemini, an intense Leo, a passionate Scorpio, a generous Virgo, a serious Libra, and so on.All 12 women have some good qualities as well as some flaw, problem, or conflicting goal that renders them imperfect matches, and Yogesh can't make up his mind. But the real question is why would any of them want to marry this drip?- The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",1,Skip,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,2419,"['Bollywood', 'movies', 'are', 'long', 'good', 'reason', 'time', 'commitment', 'required', 'audience', 'emotional', 'investment', 'story', 'same', 'true', 'operas', 'are', 'often', 'long', 'even', 'longer', 'Hindi', 'films', 'effect', 'can', 'be', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'even', 'Americans', 'accustomed', 'shorter', 'films', 'What', 'Rashee', 'tedious', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'run', 'time', 'three', 'hours', '25', 'minutes', 'not', 'example', 'Bollywood', 'artful', 'use', 'length', 'unpleasant', 'test', 'endurance.The', 'premise', 'film', 'interesting', 'one', 'actress', 'talented', 'Priyanka', 'Chopra', '12', 'different', 'characters', 'one', 'zodiac', 'sign', 'rashee', 'several', 'characters', 'too', 'many', 'explore', 'one', 'film', 'Chopra', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'full', 'half', 'hour', 'then', 'audience', 'suffered', 'too', 'much', 'milquetoast', 'co-star', 'Harman', 'Baweja', 'care', 'one', 'avatars', 'distinct', 'personality', 'hairstyle', 'up', 'character', 'Yogesh', 'point', ""'ll"", 'start', 'counting', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'signs', 'are', 'left', 'began', 'keeping', 'track', 'six', '.Yogesh', 'student', 'University', 'Chicago', 'brother', 'back', 'Mumbai', 'involved', 'financial', 'scam', 'must', 'pay', 'restitution', 'also', 'large', 'sum', 'mob', 'desperate', 'parents', 'consult', 'astrologer', 'who', 'Yogesh', 'will', 'get', 'married', '10', 'days', 'acquire', 'vast', 'wealth', 'day', 'thereby', 'solving', 'money', 'problems', 'Yogesh', 'grandfather', 'who', 'nothing', 'prediction', 'fulfills', 'deciding', 'give', 'entire', 'estate', 'Yogesh', 'wedding', 'gift', 'family', 'summons', 'Yogesh', 'home', 'got', '10', 'days', 'find', 'bride', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'conditions', 'do', 'brother', 'sake', 'Yogesh', 'simple', 'man', 'are', 'only', '12', 'types', 'people', 'world', 'according', 'zodiac', 'meet', 'one', 'woman', 'sign', 'pick', 'one', 'best', 'out', 'unsophisticated', 'Aries', 'beautiful', 'Aquarian', 'bubbly', 'Gemini', 'intense', 'Leo', 'passionate', 'Scorpio', 'generous', 'Virgo', 'serious', 'Libra', 'so', 'on.All', '12', 'women', 'have', 'good', 'qualities', 'as', 'well', 'flaw', 'problem', 'conflicting', 'goal', 'imperfect', 'matches', 'Yogesh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'real', 'question', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'marry', 'drip', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",What's Your Raashee ?
