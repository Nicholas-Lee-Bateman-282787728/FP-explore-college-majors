1315443,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B0030HJER0,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[3, 5]","I found the first season of Being Human to be kind of a mixed bag, no so with this season, it is great, different and interesting. Again we follow the lives of three supernatural creatures, Mitchell a vampire, Anna a ghost and George a werewolf, this time they are joined by a second werewolf, Nina who get accidentally scratched by George at the end of season 1. This time around there is allot more going on. I would say there are four main plot lines, one is Mitchell having to try to handle a vampire society now left leaderless after the events of season one, then we have George trying to deal with his relationship with Nina, then we have Anna being threatened by whatever lies beyond death which want her back, and then we have the main plot line of a organization of monster hunters who have their eye on the main characters.Again this show is as much about the everyday life of the four main characters as it is about a fantasy storyline, the show very much deals with the difficulties of being different. In a way the supernatural elements of this show get even more there and in your face because of the mundane events which surrounds them. If you liked the first season, even if you only liked it a little bit, you will love the second season, and really I would recommend the whole of the Being Human series to anyone who like modern fantasy and the supernatural. The show is very original and everything good in the first season is amplified ten fold in the second one.My only complaint about the season is the length. English TV series seasons tend to be short and I would have loved to see this story get more time to develop, and just see more of these wonderful characters. However the show do make good use of their time and it do not feel rushed. All in all I would say this is a very good series which drive the story onward in a satisfying way.",4,Great season but a little to short.,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,1867,"['found', 'first', 'season', 'Being', 'Human', 'be', 'kind', 'mixed', 'bag', 'so', 'season', 'great', 'different', 'interesting', 'Again', 'follow', 'lives', 'three', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'Mitchell', 'vampire', 'Anna', 'ghost', 'George', 'werewolf', 'time', 'are', 'joined', 'second', 'werewolf', 'Nina', 'who', 'get', 'accidentally', 'scratched', 'George', 'end', 'season', '1', 'time', 'allot', 'more', 'going', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'four', 'main', 'plot', 'lines', 'one', 'Mitchell', 'having', 'try', 'handle', 'vampire', 'society', 'now', 'leaderless', 'events', 'season', 'one', 'then', 'have', 'George', 'trying', 'deal', 'relationship', 'Nina', 'then', 'have', 'Anna', 'being', 'threatened', 'lies', 'death', 'want', 'back', 'then', 'have', 'main', 'plot', 'line', 'organization', 'monster', 'hunters', 'who', 'have', 'eye', 'main', 'characters.Again', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'everyday', 'life', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'fantasy', 'storyline', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'deals', 'difficulties', 'being', 'different', 'way', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'show', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'there', 'face', 'mundane', 'events', 'liked', 'first', 'season', 'even', 'only', 'liked', 'little', 'bit', 'will', 'love', 'second', 'season', 'really', 'would', 'recommend', 'whole', 'Being', 'Human', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'modern', 'fantasy', 'supernatural', 'show', 'very', 'original', 'everything', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'amplified', 'ten', 'fold', 'second', 'one.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'season', 'length', 'English', 'TV', 'series', 'seasons', 'tend', 'be', 'short', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'story', 'get', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'just', 'see', 'more', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'However', 'show', 'do', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'rushed', 'would', 'say', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'drive', 'story', 'onward', 'satisfying', 'way']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[25, 27]","Life -- and occasionally undeath -- just keep getting more complicated for the three supernatural roommates of ""Being Human."" The second season is a much darker affair than the one before it, and while there are occasional patches of lighthearted fun (""Clowns... so many... clowns!""), the real focus here is on the dangers both to AND from the supernatural world.About a month after Herrick's death, things have gotten complex for everybody. Annie has decided to get a job at the local pub, leading her to meet a man who is being manipulated by the spirits of the dead. George's strained relationship with Nina takes a new turn when it's discovered that he accidentally infected her. And with Herrick gone, Mitchell is struggling to keep the vampires from being discovered -- and may have to do some morally repulsive things to succeed.Along the way, they have to deal with Annie's matchmaking efforts, vampire attacks, Mitchell's mentor falling off the wagon, George's efforts to quell his lycanthropy (and how THAT backfires), a senseless psychic, and Mitchell falling for a pretty doctor.Unfortunately, the little gang has become an object of interest to the mysterious Kemp and his organization, who are determined to wipe out the supernatural population (""Beasts should be kept in cages""). And though the gang are not aware of them, Kemp's group is drawing closer and uncovering more and more of their secrets, until disaster strikes.The first season of ""Being Human"" was a pretty even mix of horror, comedy and drama, but the second season is a lot darker and more painful. More blood, more angst, more glimpses of the horror of being a werewolf/vampire/ghost/whatever -- and Kemp's cold-blooded approach is a pretty horrible one (example: the scene where a werewolf is prevented from shifting).But fortunately, the series has retained its3 wit (a werewolf afraid of clowns, a vampire who throws a tantrum when he misses his favorite TV show) and delicious dialogue (""This can't be happening to me! I teach language!"" ""You could teach BAD language""). And the writers tighten up the storylines with new problems for each supernatural group, which get progressively worse as the season goes on.The downside: a vein of anti-religious sentiment running through the season. Yeah, of course ONLY religious fanatics would hate werewolves, vampires and ghosts, and the ONLY possible response to the supernatural would be... you guessed it: religious fanaticism. How cliche.The three lead actors are still doing brilliant jobs as three very eccentric roommates: Lenora Crichlow's Annie is charming and sweet as a good-natured ghost, who is just trying to live her own life; Russell Tovey's George goes through some painful patches as he continues to struggle with life as a nerdy werewolf (although he's a complete jerk in Episode 1). And Aidan Turner does a truly brilliant job as a ""clean"" vampire who is slowly slipping down the moral slope.""Being Human Season Two"" is a darker, grimmer affair than the first season, but it's still pretty good TV with loads of supernatural drama.

1315457,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0030HJER0,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Slightly difficult to start, this series or season finally finds its rhythm and its pace in the chase of the bigot priest. Is it the chase of the bigot priest by the monsters, or is it the chase of the monsters by the bigot priest? Both probably. But once this chase is started it gets speed and strength frame after frame. Speedy Gonzalez is playing the road runner.The three friends of ours, plus the brand new female werewolf, and a few occasional acquaintances, are confronted to strong and powerful choices to make. To abstain from drinking blood, hence killing, for the vampires, or to go on with the blood festival. For the werewolves to transform inside a cage or to go on transforming in nature. For the ghost to go on being a spirit invisible to everyone or to go on and proceed to the other side of the door.And in-between the werewolfish changes what about having a normal; creative and fully productive life? And in-between the drinking episodes or the Bloodoholics Anonymous meetings what about having a job and a social life in your neighbourhood and in your community, if you are a member of any community. For the ghost it is more difficult because a ghost is a ghost all the time and there is no in-between episodes. The ghost can just satisfy him/herself by making cups of tea she/he will never drink.All that would be simple if the normal people around them in society were a little more empathetic and supportive. But alas there are on both sides some fundamentalists. Either the fundamentalists of monstrousness for whom there is no possible change of the monsters who have to just follow their ways, their genes. On the normal human side there are also some fundamentalist Christian (in this series) who consider it their duty to kill as many monsters as possible in order to save them, which means to get them away from normal society. That has a name: ethnic cleansing or eugenics.The worst part in this confrontation is that there will always be a scientist who will justify the eugenic ethnic cleansing on the human side, and some ancestor who will always say that things have always been the way they will always be, or vice versa, on the monster side. In other words there is no possible escape from these various dilemmas.But please do not use this very serious discussion as a metaphor of any kind of ethnic confrontation. The people of the other ethnic groups than yours are not vampires, werewolves or ghosts. They are just as human as you, so it does not work. But what about meeting some extraterrestrials tomorrow? The only point that can be generalized is that there will always be fundamentalists on any side of any divide, even when the divide is phantasmagorical. Unluckily we can say fundamentalism is a basic dimension of the human mind and behaviour. God help the poor, the rich, the weak, the meek or the powerful all alike.The series becomes then interesting though maybe slightly too dense in the peripeteias inhabiting the underbrush of the story and we get fearful because there might be some werewolf or vampire behind some heather or ferns. But I do like the various views we get of Bristol now and then.The end of this series is so full of twists we cannot even start summarizing it.

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[5, 7]","In the wake of the cataclysm that ended the prior season, our werewolf, vampire, and ghost fight to maintain their shaky humanity.  But George has infected his girlfriend Nina with the werewolf curse.  Mitchell finds himself the unwilling leader of Bristol's volatile vampire tribe.  And Annie must accept that, though she's still dead, everyone can see and hear her.  Too bad a vengeful preacher won't leave them be.The first several episodes take a different tack than last season, more of a regular episodic drama, as the characters struggle to find level footing in their newly transformed lives.  Relationships take center stage: how can you love someone alive when you're dead?  How can you love someone when your shared rage could kill you both?  How closely do romance and violence dwell in the human heart?Several near-perfect scenes stick with me: dozens of hungry vampires singing Amy Winehouse's ""Rehab"" couldn't be more spot-on.  When George seeks a way to cage his wolf, he gets mistaken for an S&M; practitioner, opening doors for gentle but uproarious comedy.  If we read these episodes as metaphors for common human experience, TV hasn't shown such insightful scenes in many a long, quiet year.Later episodes shift to a ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" tone, as though the creative team thought their audience demanded a catastrophic fantasy conclusion.  When two vampires bare fangs and hiss at each other like angry kittens, I feel laughter, not terror.  Scenes of characters chasing each other up and down dim corridors get tedious.  And the talky denouement lingers so long that I got bored waiting for it to resolve.But on the whole, this is a worthy follow-up to the first season's harrowing epic.  Despite the fantasy element, the characters' struggles are mostly relatable, based on the desire to live the kind of life most of us take for granted.

While still not (for me) up with the all time great series like The Wire or Mad Men or Breaking Bad, at it's best,it's an amazingly potent mix of heartrending drama, dark, off-beat humor and some effective horror as well.But this is horror with all the rules reversed, with the `monsters' being the human race, and the heroes our vampire werewolf and ghost who simplywant to live like other people.  At times, in an odd way it reminded me of ""Dexter"", the outsider with scary possibilities, who wants to fit in.  Butwhereas Dexter is all about emotions repressed, here the emotions are on the sleeve (occasionally a bit too much, and there are a few soapy moments).Much like the first season this starts strong, seems to lose its way a bit in the middle, with some forced humor, and repetitive moments but finisheswith such a kick that its easy to forgive any lapses.  The acting is on a very high level, the writing is witty and human, and the direction and cameraworkcan be very effective at creating mood and scares on a TV budget.  Not perfect perhaps, but it's a rare TV show that can make me think, laugh, cry, andsend a shiver down my spine all in one episode.

The bartender approaches the trio and says ""What'll you have?"" Come on--you know this isn't a real joke--but the wink, wink premise of ""Being Human"" is that the punchline to this bizarre scenario would have the three moving in together as best friends (no, that's not how it actually went--it was just used to illustrate the ""jokey"" nature of the set-up)! ""Being Human"" is a show that absolutely depends on its unique premise to intrigue and amuse its fan base. Season One, for me, was a lark--an uneven blend of comedy and horror. It capitalized on its greatest strength which was the camaraderie of the unusual and supernatural flatmates. And while that's largely what fervent viewers latched on to, the show lacked a cohesion or solid through-line to make it must-see TV. For my money, season one was most notable for the chemistry and banter between werewolf George (Russell Tovey) and vampire Mitchell (Aidan Turner).Season Two is a decidedly darker affair. I can see how viewers who appreciated the lightweight breeziness of the first season might be put off--but I, for one, embraced the growth in drama and characterization. The unifying storyline helped ground the various characters and brought them together for an emotional and bloody finale. Mitchell, who tries to unite the local vampires peaceably, is pushed to extremes when violence thwarts his plan. His back story is revealed (at times graphically) and a colder, more vicious, Mitchell emerges as the season progresses to seek retribution for various betrayals. George is struggling with his own demons--having turned his love Nina into a lycanthrope. Still hoping to cling to humanity, he eventually succumbs to a possible cure that may put everyone at risk. And Annie (Lenora Crichlow), the ghost, continues to figure out her place in the afterlife. I know everyone thinks Annie is charming (don't send me hate mail), but Crichlow continues to be the weakest side of this triangle.Amidst the highs--George and Nina share the series most dramatic and believable moments--and the lows--Annie gets a job as a pub waitress (don't ask!), ""Being Human"" builds a quiet intensity in its sophomore season. The climax is a killer, even Annie is utilized effectively. A solid recommendation for fans of the genre. I do want to shout out to Russell Tovey. Tovey really becomes the star of this piece, steals every scene he's in, and with Sinead Keenan (as Nina--the season's MVP) light up the screen with the best acting the show has seen. Kudos.

The Oppo players (BDP-80 and BDP-83) are among the few that can both output 50hz native AND convert it to 60hz, depending on your needs.MOST British television shows these days are shot in 1080/50hz, because the Eurpoean HDTV standard is still on the same 50hz refresh rate that the old PAL standard was on.

1315482,A35IW20X5N3CEB,B0030HJER0,Novelwit2000,"[1, 2]","I mean, 'Being Human' started out as this...how do I put this? This 'little' show. With this small idea--to just live in this house, get along with the neighbors, blend in with these so called, low-key jobs and well...be human.And in the first season, you see a lot of that. And it's a fun ride to be had by all.Though by the second season, things have had a way of moving along--to the point, that maybe just 'being human' isn't quite the goal anymore.It's more like just trying to keep your head above water now. If the powers that be could just allow that.And from very early on in the new season's opener, we're introduced to these 'powers'.They come in the form of two new characters: Daisy and her husband Ivan. These two figure a lot into Mitchell's life--and that's probably because they're vampires too.I won't give too much away here, but I think it's because of the two of them, that you ultimately see an advancement in Mitchell's personality.It's like Mitchell sorta steps up and assumes a more leadership role in the vampire community at large in the wake of Herrick's departure. (Or at least, he tries.) And through this role, Mitchell becomes a more darker figure.And can I tell you how this really changes your perception of him?Because from the first season, you're thinking that you sorta know this Mitchell character. I mean, I thought I did. It's like from last season, Mitchell always came off as this fun loving guy.I mean, oh sure he was a vampire all right, but there was always this light-heartedness about him too, that always managed to shine its way through. (That's what I always loved about his character--he was a vampire that you could love and even cuddle up to.) This season though, maybe not so much. (Though there is a cute scene in episode four where George is jumping on top of Mitchell and Mitchell is telling George that he stinks--I think this is one of the FEW times in the season that you see Mitchell actually smile.) Boy, do I miss this. (Only because you got so much MORE of this in season one.) Oh well.And maybe when I think about it, that's the evolution that Mitchell's character needed to make. You know, to advance the plot along.There's an evolution that the George character makes too. He seems bolder this time around. And decisive too.It's good that with (his girlfriend Nina's encouragement), that he gets on with things and gets himself a new job teaching English as a second language. This development really suits him I think, though...again, I won't give too much away, but some of my beefs about this season probably go to the writer(s).It's like the writers will do something, like they'll take the story in one direction, then they'll do this 'take back'. (That's what ultimately happens with George.)OK, so I'll give ONE thing away regarding a 'take back'.Early on in this season, the ghost Annie can be seen. And she's so confident with this ability, that she even gets herself a job in a pub.Only after the show progresses along, this ability of being seen (seemingly at random or maybe not?) is taken away from her. And when she can no longer be seen, I'll tell you it's heartbreaking. And kinda pointless too.I mean, why give her this ability (to be seen) just to take it away? [Note to the writers: I think it would be a good idea to make Annie be able to control when she wants to be visible and when she doesn't want to be--like I think a 'real' ghost would be.] Then her character could have more of a life and you could do more things with her.All in all though, I will give the writers of the show their 'props' for keeping 'Being Human' fresh and entertaining. The way the second season ends, you can hardly wait for the third. I know I can't!(Also, how the show had these flashbacks--that was a nice touch too. I really liked the one with Mitchell and his girlfriend from the 60's.)And something else with the Mitchell character that I feel I need to add:  I really feel astonished with where the writers took him this time around.It's like whenever I used to think of him, he was almost like the 'father' figure of the group. And it made so much sense. Because it was like he provided the balance and structure of how George and Annie got along.Only in this season, he sorta crosses that line. (Or really abandons it!)Because to hear Mitchell say (to Annie) 'I just think about your body...under those clothes. I think about your skin...' This is a NEW Mitchell indeed!Because before all this commentary, I NEVER gleaned any kind of 'physical' attraction between Mitchell and Annie. (That is, it never crossed my mind that he could be attracted to her like that.) I mean, because he'd always seemed like this jovial 'big brother' type to me.Now, not so much.And so like I said in my title, the second season of 'Being Human' really DID turn the corner!And maybe that's not such a bad thing after all.Watch and ENJOY!!!",5,"Wow, did this show turn the corner!",1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,4897,"['mean', ""'Being"", 'Human', 'started', 'out', 'how', 'do', 'put', ""'little"", 'show', 'small', 'idea', 'just', 'live', 'house', 'get', 'neighbors', 'blend', 'so', 'called', 'low-key', 'jobs', 'well', 'be', 'human.And', 'first', 'season', 'see', 'lot', 'fun', 'ride', 'be', 'had', 'all.Though', 'second', 'season', 'things', 'have', 'had', 'way', 'moving', 'along', 'point', 'maybe', 'just', ""'being"", 'human', ""n't"", 'quite', 'goal', 'anymore.It', 'more', 'like', 'just', 'trying', 'keep', 'head', 'water', 'now', 'powers', 'be', 'could', 'just', 'allow', 'that.And', 'very', 'early', 'new', 'season', 'opener', ""'re"", 'introduced', ""'powers'.They"", 'come', 'form', 'two', 'new', 'characters', 'Daisy', 'husband', 'Ivan', 'two', 'figure', 'lot', 'Mitchell', 'life', 'probably', ""'re"", 'vampires', 'too.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'here', 'think', 'two', 'ultimately', 'see', 'advancement', 'Mitchell', 'personality.It', 'Mitchell', 'sorta', 'up', 'more', 'leadership', 'role', 'vampire', 'community', 'large', 'wake', 'Herrick', 'departure', 'least', 'role', 'Mitchell', 'more', 'darker', 'figure.And', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'really', 'perception', 'first', 'season', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'sorta', 'know', 'Mitchell', 'character', 'mean', 'thought', 'did', 'last', 'season', 'Mitchell', 'always', 'came', 'off', 'fun', 'loving', 'guy.I', 'mean', 'oh', 'sure', 'was', 'vampire', 'right', 'there', 'was', 'always', 'light-heartedness', 'too', 'always', 'managed', 'shine', 'way', 'what', 'always', 'loved', 'character', 'was', 'vampire', 'could', 'love', 'even', 'cuddle', 'up', 'season', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'cute', 'scene', 'episode', 'four', 'where', 'George', 'jumping', 'top', 'Mitchell', 'Mitchell', 'telling', 'George', 'think', 'one', 'FEW', 'times', 'season', 'see', 'Mitchell', 'actually', 'smile', 'Boy', 'do', 'miss', 'Only', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'MORE', 'season', 'one', 'Oh', 'well.And', 'maybe', 'when', 'think', 'evolution', 'Mitchell', 'character', 'needed', 'make', 'know', 'advance', 'plot', 'evolution', 'George', 'character', 'too', 'bolder', 'time', 'around', 'decisive', 'too.It', 'good', 'girlfriend', 'Nina', 'encouragement', 'things', 'new', 'job', 'teaching', 'English', 'second', 'language', 'development', 'really', 'suits', 'think', 'though', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'beefs', 'season', 'probably', 'go', 'writer', '.It', 'writers', 'will', 'do', 'something', ""'ll"", 'take', 'story', 'one', 'direction', 'then', ""'ll"", 'do', ""'take"", 'back', 'what', 'ultimately', 'George', 'OK', ""'ll"", 'give', 'ONE', 'thing', 'away', 'regarding', ""'take"", ""back'.Early"", 'season', 'ghost', 'Annie', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'so', 'confident', 'ability', 'even', 'job', 'pub.Only', 'show', 'along', 'ability', 'being', 'seen', 'seemingly', 'random', 'maybe', 'not', 'taken', 'away', 'when', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'heartbreaking', 'kinda', 'pointless', 'too.I', 'mean', 'why', 'give', 'ability', 'be', 'seen', 'just', 'take', 'away', '[', 'Note', 'writers', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'make', 'Annie', 'be', 'able', 'control', 'when', 'be', 'visible', 'when', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'think', ""'real"", 'ghost', 'would', 'be', ']', 'Then', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'more', 'life', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'things', 'her.All', 'will', 'give', 'writers', 'show', ""'props"", 'keeping', ""'Being"", 'Human', 'fresh', 'entertaining', 'way', 'second', 'season', 'ends', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'third', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Also', 'how', 'show', 'had', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'too', 'really', 'liked', 'one', 'Mitchell', 'girlfriend', '60', 'something', 'else', 'Mitchell', 'character', 'feel', 'need', 'add', 'really', 'feel', 'astonished', 'where', 'writers', 'took', 'time', 'around.It', 'whenever', 'used', 'think', 'was', 'almost', ""'father"", 'figure', 'group', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'sense', 'was', 'provided', 'balance', 'structure', 'how', 'George', 'Annie', 'got', 'along.Only', 'season', 'crosses', 'line', 'really', 'abandons', 'hear', 'Mitchell', 'say', 'Annie', 'just', 'think', 'body', 'clothes', 'think', 'skin', 'NEW', 'Mitchell', 'indeed', 'commentary', 'NEVER', 'gleaned', 'kind', ""'physical"", 'attraction', 'Mitchell', 'Annie', 'never', 'crossed', 'mind', 'could', 'be', 'attracted', 'mean', ""'d"", 'always', 'seemed', 'jovial', ""'big"", 'brother', 'type', 'me.Now', 'not', 'so', 'much.And', 'said', 'title', 'second', 'season', ""'Being"", 'Human', 'really', 'DID', 'turn', 'corner', 'maybe', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'all.Watch', 'ENJOY']",N/A

Mitchell is dealing with the fallout of the vampire community left without its leader. And meanwhile, he begins a relationship with a new doctor with dark secrets of her own. George also finds a new girlfriend, but her daughter is wary of him. And Annie deals with constant changes and challenges to being non-corporeal.This season ramps up the suspense and violence to a whole new level. The trio are faced with a new enemy this season: CenSSA, a religious organization headed by a man with a deeply-rooted vendetta.  Mitchell takes a dark turn to his former blood-thirsty and violent self that I didn't care for. It also didn't make much sense when he drastically shifts mind-sets and moods without much provocation. Most of his decisions and actions this season seem severely out of character, even before he is betrayed. He never seemed to care much for the vampire community until they are left without a leader. Now, he cares more for them than humans.  Despite this, the plot and pacing throughout the season is non-stop suspense, thrills and chills.

1315491,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B0030HJER0,Scott FS,"[1, 2]","I had mixed feelings about the second season of the BBC's 'Being Human'.  The first half was as good as it gets; Mitchell trying to get Britain's vampires to swear off blood (and killing) and George trying sleeping pills to make the monthly transition to werewolf a little less, well, traumatic.  But, no good deed goes unpunished.  And Annie, the ghost, finds a boyfriend of sorts, only to have a unique problem with him.The thing I didn't like was the last two episodes.  Mitchell has a terrible change of heart after a tragedy, and Annie gets swept up in the Anglican priest's experiments in dealing with those represented by the three housemates.  Mitchell's change is especially terrible; you can no longer sympathize with this young hunkish misfit.  He and his erstwhile girlfriend are reunited, and things are not well in Bristol.  George maintains, but Annie has the rug pulled out from under her, and she's powerless to prevent her sudden change of scenery.Mitchell must become more sympathetic for me to root for him.  Ditch the old girlfriend, avoid the new girlfriend (well, that's not a problem) and get in good graces with the people in Bristol again.Maybe season three will sort it all out.

Just saw this cliche' of a hottie sitting on a couch, and this beautiful chick tells him and the other guy, &#34;Okay, shut up I'm gonna tell you...&#34;  The commercial ends with the dark hottie saying, &#34;The disembodied ghost of a dead woman is getting a job...&#34;  &#34;My mind was completely blown at the concept.  I was awed that that was a ghost, even more awed that the guys could see her, and just hella curious.  My obsession began in that instant. I searched and discovered the show was about A ghost, a vampire and a werewolf who were roomates.  But I couldn't find the damned show!  Then I saw a Syfy commercial for Being Human.  I got all excited, and marked by calender and set my DVR -but when I saw the Syfy show, I was HELLA DISAPPOINTED. These weren't the same people I saw from that commercial.I set out to Google once again and found the show I had been jonesin' for was the BBC original.  That SYFY created an American remake.I was so desperate, that I settled in for what ever crumbs they threw at me. I accepted the American version.  It was cool enough.THEN...I...DISCOVERED...BBCAMERICA.And it was ON-LIKE-DONKEY-KONG.The BBC original is just pure magic. They are lovely and funny and tragic.  The characters are so awesome.  the writing is so innovative. The actor delivery is so magnanimus.  And not just the three main characters.  Some of the best scenes were with the guest characters.  Herrick is just brilliant as a character. Not to mention, the story with the social worker in season 2.  She has this &#34;bitch slap ya&#34; line with her lap top that will just split your sides.The adventures of the original trio stay embedded in ones heart for months and years to come.  Flashbacks of scenes and scenarios that are just meaningful on an indescribable level.There's a true love between these characters that everyone must experience at least once. One experience is all it takes typically to get hooked into all of the first three seasons.  And out of pure loyalty, It makes sense to stick around for the final two.  Different cast in the 4th and 5th seasons. But they win our hearts in the end.Theres no replacing Mitchell, George, and Annie. To be fair, there's no replacing Nina either.I would recommend checking them out on Amazon PRIME, the eps are free at the moment (though they are shortened by 15mins compared to the DVDs -you really don't miss much.)Try BBCAmerica's Being Human.Come back and tell me what you think",5,My one true accidental love,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,2567,"['saw', 'promo', 'commercial', 'Season', '2', 'Series', '2', ""'re"", 'British', 'Had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'Just', 'saw', 'cliche', 'hottie', 'sitting', 'couch', 'beautiful', 'chick', 'other', 'guy', '34', 'Okay', 'shut', 'up', ""'m"", 'gon', 'tell', '34', 'commercial', 'dark', 'hottie', 'saying', '34', 'disembodied', 'ghost', 'dead', 'woman', 'getting', 'job', '34', '34', 'mind', 'was', 'completely', 'blown', 'concept', 'was', 'awed', 'was', 'ghost', 'even', 'more', 'awed', 'guys', 'could', 'see', 'just', 'hella', 'curious', 'obsession', 'began', 'instant', 'searched', 'discovered', 'show', 'was', 'ghost', 'vampire', 'werewolf', 'who', 'were', 'roomates', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'damned', 'show', 'Then', 'saw', 'Syfy', 'commercial', 'Being', 'Human', 'got', 'excited', 'marked', 'calender', 'set', 'DVR', '-but', 'when', 'saw', 'Syfy', 'show', 'was', 'HELLA', 'DISAPPOINTED', 'were', ""n't"", 'same', 'people', 'saw', 'commercial.I', 'set', 'out', 'Google', 'once', 'again', 'found', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'jonesin', 'was', 'BBC', 'original', 'SYFY', 'created', 'American', 'remake.I', 'was', 'so', 'desperate', 'settled', 'what', 'ever', 'threw', 'accepted', 'American', 'version', 'was', 'cool', 'enough.THEN', 'DISCOVERED', 'BBCAMERICA.And', 'was', 'ON-LIKE-DONKEY-KONG.The', 'BBC', 'original', 'just', 'pure', 'magic', 'are', 'lovely', 'funny', 'tragic', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'awesome', 'writing', 'so', 'innovative', 'actor', 'delivery', 'so', 'magnanimus', 'not', 'just', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'best', 'scenes', 'were', 'guest', 'characters', 'Herrick', 'just', 'brilliant', 'character', 'Not', 'mention', 'story', 'social', 'worker', 'season', '2', '34', 'bitch', 'slap', 'ya', '34', 'line', 'lap', 'top', 'will', 'just', 'split', 'sides.The', 'adventures', 'original', 'trio', 'stay', 'embedded', 'ones', 'heart', 'months', 'years', 'come', 'Flashbacks', 'scenes', 'scenarios', 'are', 'just', 'meaningful', 'indescribable', 'level.There', 'true', 'love', 'characters', 'everyone', 'must', 'experience', 'least', 'once', 'One', 'experience', 'typically', 'get', 'hooked', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'pure', 'loyalty', 'sense', 'stick', 'around', 'final', 'two', 'Different', 'cast', '4th', '5th', 'seasons', 'win', 'hearts', 'end.Theres', 'replacing', 'Mitchell', 'George', 'Annie', 'be', 'fair', 'replacing', 'Nina', 'either.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'Amazon', 'PRIME', 'eps', 'are', 'free', 'moment', 'are', 'shortened', '15mins', 'compared', 'DVDs', '-you', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'much', 'Try', 'BBCAmerica', 'Being', 'Human.Come', 'back', 'tell', 'what', 'think']",N/A
