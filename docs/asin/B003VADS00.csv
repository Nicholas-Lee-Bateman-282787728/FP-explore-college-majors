Perhaps the other opinion given couldn't understand the consternation of a woman looking forward to engagement and meeting her future ""in laws"" only to be exasperated by her Uncle bringing home a complete stranger.  I felt the heroin's acting fit the pressure exacted on her given the situation not of her own choosing.""Moonlight and Mistletoe"" was also a ""happy"" Christmas movie and I can recommend both for most people.

And though the plot was good, the acting of the heroine ruined it for me. Not sure if it was the actress or just the way she performed her part. Either way, I was not impressed with her acting and it totally took away from the story. I got what her character was suppose represent but it was almost like she was a spoiled, snotty brat...with a smile on her face and in her voice. It just didn't it. It seemed forced and unnatural.On the other hand, the actor that played the hero was great. I liked his character and felt his acting was done well. Smooth, natural, a character you can fall in love with. Which is really too bad that one character/actress had to ruin it for the entire movie.Good thing I'd purchased this movie in a two pack, along with ""Moonlight & Mistletoe"" Now that's a movie I could watch over and over.Moonlight & Mistletoe-I discovered this movie in a search for something to watch. In the end I purchased a two pack, Moonlight & Mistletoe and The Most Wonderful Time of the Year. The Most Wonderful Time of the Year I could have done without. The acting of the heroine was poorly done, though with another actress could have been a good movie.Moonlight & Mistletoe on the other hand was a wonderful movie. Great acting. Great storyline. It was a cute story done well that will warm your heart and having you smiling.
