Before sharing it with younger children I would watch it first so if they want to know why the aunt has a cold heart towards her nephew in the beginning of the movie you can have a clearer understanding how to respond to it.  So often we forget hardships can turn people bitter and cold because that dark cloud has never left as so warmly stated in movie Loves Abiding Joy #4 of the Love Comes Softly Series (which are my ultimate favorite movies).  Having come from a hard life myself if I hadn't had a loving home and God in my life I too could have turned out differently.  We are a product of our neutering or lack of it; in most cases.  Sometimes I forget that we aren't promised a life without hardships as this movie shows but how we learn to grow from our adventures; that, with trust and forgiveness you can find your way back.  ""Love"" can soften even Jane Seymore the cold hearted aunt.",5,Touching Wild Horses,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,924,"['really', 'loved', 'movie', 'sharing', 'younger', 'children', 'would', 'watch', 'first', 'so', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'aunt', 'cold', 'heart', 'nephew', 'beginning', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'clearer', 'understanding', 'how', 'respond', 'So', 'often', 'forget', 'hardships', 'can', 'turn', 'people', 'bitter', 'cold', 'dark', 'cloud', 'never', 'left', 'so', 'warmly', 'stated', 'movie', 'Loves', 'Abiding', 'Joy', '4', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'Series', 'are', 'ultimate', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Having', 'come', 'hard', 'life', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'loving', 'home', 'God', 'life', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'differently', 'are', 'product', 'neutering', 'lack', 'most', 'cases', 'Sometimes', 'forget', 'are', ""n't"", 'promised', 'life', 'hardships', 'movie', 'how', 'learn', 'grow', 'adventures', 'trust', 'forgiveness', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'Love', 'can', 'soften', 'even', 'Jane', 'Seymore', 'cold', 'hearted', 'aunt']",N/A
831354,A1GVKGSN6V1VTX,B0002DRDOG,Arctic Voice Earl,"[8, 8]","We and our two Alaska Huskies settled down during a chilly November night in the Heartland to watch the movie which simply presented a story on an isolated but lovely island with just a few humans and some beautiful wild horses.  Nothing high tech and absolutely no long car chases!The movie met all our expectation --story of a young boy sent to his aunt who works with the horses on the island. His family has a lot of problems and fighting, and one can only hope the quiet island, the aunt and the horses can heal his pain.But there are glitches, even in the island environment. The boy tries to learn what his aunt (the ever beautiful Jane Seymour) is like and what she expects from him. Also the very simple life, compared with the city.There is only one other character with any real time in movie ---the wilderness bureaucrat, played by Charles Martin Smith. (He's older than his wilderness bureaucrat in ""Never Cry Wolf,"" but still feisty.)The horses are in the background for a while, and then an orphaned foal grabs at the boy's heart, and we wondered if all that built up might come crashing down.Watch the movie, with any pets you might have. You will all enjoy it.Earl",5,Bonding with wild horses and different generations,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,1181,"['two', 'Alaska', 'Huskies', 'settled', 'down', 'chilly', 'November', 'night', 'Heartland', 'watch', 'movie', 'simply', 'presented', 'story', 'isolated', 'lovely', 'island', 'just', 'few', 'humans', 'beautiful', 'wild', 'horses', 'Nothing', 'high', 'tech', 'absolutely', 'long', 'car', 'chases', 'movie', 'met', 'expectation', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'sent', 'aunt', 'who', 'horses', 'island', 'family', 'lot', 'problems', 'fighting', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'quiet', 'island', 'aunt', 'horses', 'can', 'heal', 'pain.But', 'are', 'glitches', 'even', 'island', 'environment', 'boy', 'learn', 'what', 'aunt', 'ever', 'beautiful', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'like', 'what', 'Also', 'very', 'simple', 'life', 'compared', 'city.There', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'character', 'real', 'time', 'movie', '-the', 'wilderness', 'bureaucrat', 'played', 'Charles', 'Martin', 'Smith', 'older', 'wilderness', 'bureaucrat', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'still', 'feisty', 'horses', 'are', 'background', 'while', 'then', 'orphaned', 'foal', 'grabs', 'boy', 'heart', 'wondered', 'built', 'up', 'might', 'come', 'crashing', 'down.Watch', 'movie', 'pets', 'might', 'have', 'will', 'all', 'enjoy', 'it.Earl']",N/A

He has not seen her before and they have to begin a relationship.They are on an island that she is always struggling to keep her rights to stay there.  The govt would like her off the island.  They have a warden on the island and he checks on her all the time.  BUT the other occupants of the island are wild horses.  They are the reason she is there.  The horses are legislated for in a heavy way. They are not allowed to be touched, fed, ridden.  They are not supposed to have any interaction with humans.  But the woman and boy are building a relationship of love slowly.  She has a secret past where she had a child and it was taken from her and adopted because she was and unwed mother.  She has chosen the horses to be her family but the boy sneaks her heart too.  A horse is drowned on the shores of the island by the rubbish nets fishermen leave.  But the horse has a foal that is alive and needs feeding and care.  The law says it should have to live or die.  That would be legal but the boy decides it is not right.  So they enter into a secret relationship of caring for the horse and setting it free when it can survive with the herd.Touching Wild Horses is a very touching tale.  The acting is so good.

Clere ""Member of  INSITE""","[0, 0]","Jane Seymour delivers another great performance in ""Touching Wild Horses""-a somewhat different role for Jane who often appears in period films. Living alone on an island with wild horses, she suddenly acquires a young boy to care for. During the course of the film Jane mellows from her visibly hard exterior to a caring and loving individual. She accurately portrays and obeys all the rules (well, almost all) as they relate to the protected wild horses. She has clearly taken the time to verify all the details to be sure what she says is accurate (as she did in the Dr. Quinn series). The film was shot on Sable Island (off the coast of Nova Scotia) and information on the island can be found on the Internet.
