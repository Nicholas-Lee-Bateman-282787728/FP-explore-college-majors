1367439,A1ULSLL0SUVDSD,B003VNJIWY,Amazon Customer,"[3, 5]","I saw this film recently at the Philadelphia Qfest.  What a stinkerroo!!  The film appeared to be shot using video, which has none of the lighting nuances or shadows associated with film.  The sets and settings were so poorly constructed, that I was counting the seams and nailholes on the backdrop.  It appears that shooting in video highlights every defect, especially since the lighting was glaring.  However, as this will be viewed mostly on small screen, perhaps those defects won't be so evident.As to the cast, I will be kind and say that these guys didn't look like deer in the headlights all of the time.  The lead actor's protrayal was weak, especially since he was taking a moral high ground.  The supporting players appeared as if they came off the street to do the director a favor.  At best, the lead's best male friend appeared to be doing a takeoff of Tony Danza.The story line is a relevant one, to have an open/closed relationship and surely one that deserves a better treatment than what it got here.  Save your money or at best, buy used and then try and resell.  It is not worthy of a place in your permanent collection.",1,Big Disappointment...,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,1141,"['saw', 'film', 'recently', 'Philadelphia', 'Qfest', 'What', 'stinkerroo', 'film', 'appeared', 'be', 'shot', 'using', 'video', 'none', 'lighting', 'nuances', 'shadows', 'associated', 'film', 'sets', 'settings', 'were', 'so', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'was', 'counting', 'seams', 'nailholes', 'backdrop', 'shooting', 'video', 'highlights', 'defect', 'especially', 'lighting', 'was', 'glaring', 'However', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'mostly', 'small', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'defects', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'evident.As', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'kind', 'say', 'guys', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'deer', 'headlights', 'time', 'lead', 'actor', 'protrayal', 'was', 'weak', 'especially', 'was', 'taking', 'moral', 'high', 'ground', 'supporting', 'players', 'appeared', 'came', 'off', 'street', 'do', 'director', 'favor', 'best', 'lead', 'best', 'male', 'friend', 'appeared', 'be', 'doing', 'takeoff', 'Tony', 'Danza.The', 'story', 'line', 'relevant', 'one', 'have', 'open/closed', 'relationship', 'surely', 'one', 'better', 'treatment', 'what', 'got', 'here', 'Save', 'money', 'best', 'buy', 'used', 'then', 'try', 'resell', 'not', 'worthy', 'place', 'permanent', 'collection']",N/A

When he notices a runner going past his house at a certain time each day, he makes it a point to be out there, and eventually meets Grey.  They begin to date, and are very compatible on many levels, except one:  Ben wants a committed, monogamous relationship, and Grey doesn't see that as a possibility for him.Written (based on his own experiences) and produced by Ronnie Kerr (who some may remember as the lead in ""Regarding Billy""), who also stars as Ben.  The concept was good, and there are some realistic, emotional scenes that are done very well. However, while I realize the movie was shot in one week, directly on video with a tiny budget, the overall quality of the production did detract from what could have been much better with a bit more effort and care.  I also thought the ending was a significant cop-out that evaded the point of the story. However, I do give them credit for using realistic-looking 30-something actors (who did a good job, with the material they had to work with), rather than the usual model-quality, buff ""actors"" seen in many gay films.

Many of the scenes were quite good and the relationship between the two leads was quite believable.  It tackles a sensitive subject quite well - but as other reviewers have mentioned I too must agree that the ending was quite disappointing.  I think everyone deserves to have their standards and the film seems to suggest that ""give in"".  Love is NEVER enough to maintain a relationship.  Two people MUST have common ideas, values and goals in order for it to last.  The film says that Love is what is left after you stop judging.
