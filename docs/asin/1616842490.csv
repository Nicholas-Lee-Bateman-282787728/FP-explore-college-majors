194857,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,1616842490,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 4]","I should get my biases out of the way:  I am a big 'Narnia' fan, both of the books, and, so far, of the movies.  The best measuring stick that the latter is up to par as a medium is to determine whether or not the celluloid versions provide a fluid and engaging adventure, and, if the movie offering retains a good measure of charm the books elicit.Now for 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,' there seemed to be plenty of both.  'Prince Caspian,' in my estimation was a better honed adventure, but it was at the expense of the charm factor.I must also confess, just like watching the first 'Star Wars' trilogy, reading the 'Narnia' Chronicles has me holding the first installment dear, but, objectively, as I thought the second film 'The Empire Strikes Back' did measurably better with dramatic unfolding, tension, and visual splendour, my objective favorite 'Narnia' book, short of 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' having all the wonder and magic of a first leg, I especially loved 'Voyage of the Dawn Treader' as the best of the seven (as the most complex, innovative, and transporting), so judging a movie rendition I thought would be a harsh affair.This is especially true when you consider how vividly C.S. Lewis has instilled the framed picture that is the portal of some surrealistically imaginative scenes.  How this movie captured the dark, unconscious voyage past the island where it is difficult to convey these edgy, nightmarish scenes with the skill of Lewis, I feared, would have been inadequate translation on the screen at best and disastrous at worst.Happily, I found the adventure to be well-honed like 'Prince Caspian,' without it being at the expense of that deep, dark voyage the vessel takes to an island of unconscious so dangerous to our young pilgrims.Beyond my expectations was the fine performance by young actor as the prodigy intellectual nuisance, cousin Eustace (Will Poulter)--scientific skepticism and agnostic or atheistic scorn in child form.  He is truly the medium or vessel that keeps the tension running in '...Dawn Treader' afloat.  Honorably mention goes to Georgie Henley (Lucy) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund) who were always the most interesting and best in the show the first two rounds.I'm not entirely sure why there are such tepid reviews for '...Dawn Treader' amongth the pro critics.  During the first round, some said there was wooden acting.  Now, even the actors as Susan and Peter (who are both marginalized in the book and the movie) seem more relaxed and at home with their roles.  Having stated this, I can only surmise that the critics are perhaps all 'Lord of the Rings,' 'Harry Potter'-ed, and 'Narnia'-ed out.Well edited, engagingly portrayed, and having the special effects with a trajectory that keeps our young heroes going, this 'Narnia,' may be the best in the series--in book or film form.  It is hard to imagine C.S. Lewis not being impressed with the marvels we have today--not merely the technology to do his works justice, but the execution and the young child actors who have visibly done what was necessary to bring his fantasy masterpiece to life.",4,'Dawn Treader' Gives Us the Best of Both Worlds,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,3129,"['should', 'get', 'biases', 'way', 'am', 'big', ""'Narnia"", 'fan', 'books', 'so', 'far', 'movies', 'best', 'measuring', 'stick', 'latter', 'up', 'par', 'medium', 'determine', 'not', 'celluloid', 'versions', 'provide', 'fluid', 'engaging', 'adventure', 'movie', 'offering', 'good', 'measure', 'charm', 'books', 'elicit.Now', ""'The"", 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'plenty', ""'Prince"", 'Caspian', 'estimation', 'was', 'better', 'honed', 'adventure', 'was', 'expense', 'charm', 'factor.I', 'must', 'also', 'confess', 'just', 'watching', 'first', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'reading', ""'Narnia"", 'Chronicles', 'holding', 'first', 'installment', 'dear', 'objectively', 'thought', 'second', 'film', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'did', 'measurably', 'better', 'dramatic', 'unfolding', 'tension', 'visual', 'splendour', 'objective', 'favorite', 'book', 'short', ""'The"", 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'having', 'wonder', 'magic', 'first', 'leg', 'especially', 'loved', ""'Voyage"", 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'best', 'seven', 'most', 'complex', 'innovative', 'transporting', 'so', 'judging', 'movie', 'rendition', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'harsh', 'affair.This', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'vividly', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'instilled', 'framed', 'picture', 'portal', 'surrealistically', 'imaginative', 'scenes', 'How', 'movie', 'captured', 'dark', 'unconscious', 'voyage', 'island', 'where', 'difficult', 'convey', 'edgy', 'nightmarish', 'scenes', 'skill', 'Lewis', 'feared', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'inadequate', 'translation', 'screen', 'best', 'disastrous', 'worst.Happily', 'found', 'adventure', 'be', 'well-honed', ""'Prince"", 'Caspian', 'being', 'expense', 'deep', 'dark', 'voyage', 'vessel', 'island', 'unconscious', 'so', 'dangerous', 'young', 'pilgrims.Beyond', 'expectations', 'was', 'fine', 'performance', 'young', 'actor', 'prodigy', 'intellectual', 'nuisance', 'cousin', 'Eustace', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'scientific', 'skepticism', 'agnostic', 'atheistic', 'scorn', 'child', 'form', 'truly', 'medium', 'vessel', 'tension', 'running', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'afloat', 'Honorably', 'mention', 'Georgie', 'Henley', 'Lucy', 'Skandar', 'Keynes', 'Edmund', 'who', 'were', 'always', 'most', 'interesting', 'best', 'show', 'first', 'two', 'rounds.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'such', 'tepid', 'reviews', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'amongth', 'pro', 'critics', 'first', 'round', 'said', 'was', 'wooden', 'acting', 'Now', 'even', 'actors', 'Susan', 'Peter', 'who', 'are', 'marginalized', 'book', 'movie', 'seem', 'more', 'relaxed', 'home', 'roles', 'Having', 'stated', 'can', 'only', 'surmise', 'critics', 'are', 'perhaps', ""'Lord"", 'Rings', ""Potter'-ed"", ""'Narnia'-ed"", 'out.Well', 'edited', 'engagingly', 'portrayed', 'having', 'special', 'effects', 'trajectory', 'young', 'heroes', 'going', ""'Narnia"", 'may', 'be', 'best', 'series', 'book', 'film', 'form', 'hard', 'imagine', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'not', 'being', 'impressed', 'marvels', 'have', 'today', 'not', 'merely', 'technology', 'do', 'works', 'justice', 'execution', 'young', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'visibly', 'done', 'what', 'was', 'necessary', 'bring', 'fantasy', 'masterpiece', 'life']",N/A
194858,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,1616842490,AbeStreet,"[0, 0]","THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER (VotDT) is a relatively good film, even better than the story is the production attention to detail and development.  Of all seven books that make up the Narnia stories I have long felt that VotDT is my second to least favorite.  THE LAST BATTLE is my least favorite story.  Anyway, while the book never quite engaged me I have felt that the 1989 BBC film production and Fox&#8217;s recent film were both quite good and each is probably my favorite when compared with the other film productions they were a part of.I saw VotDT in the theater and in 3D.  The 3d didn&#8217;t really do much for me.  However I was really impressed with the attention to detail that went into costumes, scene location sets, and especially the Dawn Treader set itself.  While the story didn&#8217;t quite adhere to the exact details of the voyages contained in the book the ship itself was a thing of beauty.  If you watch the extra features on the Blu-Ray DVD you will find just how much detail went into every little aspect of the ship.  While I did not notice all the detail outright when first watching the film I can see, after watching the special feature, why I was so taken with the ship itself.The teen actor that portrayed Eustace Scrubb did a remarkable job.  If THE SILVER CHAIR is to be made I hope it is soon as I&#8217;m sure the actor will soon if not already become a young adult.  Lastly, the end credits are beautifully well done.  The song &#8220;There&#8217;s a Place for us&#8221; performed by Carrie Underwood is perfectly paired with the original artwork from the novel, illustrated by  Pauline Baynes.

194863,A1FALNRP7TPE3V,1616842490,A. Lucy,"[1, 2]","The best of all the currently released Narnia films.From the moment I saw the movie ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" (2005), I have been hooked on Narnia. I am completely in love with the wonderful world C.S. Lewis created when he wrote his wonderful classical fantasy series. I have read all of the books many times, and actually get lonesome for them if it's been a while since my last re-reading sension of those so-called children's novels. When ""Prince Caspian"" came out, I went to see the film, I think, about six times in theaters; I couldn't get enough of it, and believe it or not, this was my reaction to a movie I liked a little LESS than ""Lion witch wardrobe""! Voyage of the Dawn Treader is even BETTER than that spendid first film, though it seems hard to believe.I've seen others complaining that Voyage of the Dawn Treader fails either because they feel it strayed too far from its sourse material or because it's ""lack of explaining"" for things in attempting to keep close to the book in some ways made it just a bad movie over all (it's one of those 'darned if you do, darned if you don't' things, I suppose). I don't agree with them one bit. First off, what movie is ever exactly like the book it was based on (excepting MAYBE Holes, which was pretty close, but that doesn't count since the same writer wrote both the book and the screenplay)? Was ""Voyage"" a wonderful, endearing book that stood the test of time? You bet it is! I will always love that book. But I'm not going to knock a movie because it isn't word for word from it, or because of an added subplot.The themes, whatever anyone else says, to me, seem the same in both the book and the movie. I understand that this is subjective since so many people take Narnia in different ways, each having their own little version of what it should be like in their heads (I know I did when I read the books), but I will be free with my thoughts nontheless. Lucy's wanting to look like Susan was beautifully fleshed out in this film. The Green Mist, while not in the book, was part of dark island (which WAS in the book) and I believe something about a mist is mentioned there; so what if the screen-play writers wanted it green? I don't care if they wanted it aquamarine for pity's sake. Eustace and Reepicheep's relationship was beautifully potrayed. Aslan said his most famous line from the end of the book almost word for word.Now, to be fair, this film was shorter than the other two, making the pacing feel either quick or (in some minds) rushed. I think that's just the way Fox does their movies though (cases in point: ""Percy Jackson"", ""City of Ember""). And that may have made it harder for some folks to get into it. And as this is a review of the blu-ray/DVD, I'll mention that while this is a better movie than Prince Caspian it does not have as many good deleted scenes. The deleted scenes in VDT are cute, don't get me wrong, but nothing that felt like ""Oh, gosh, why did they cut that?"" like I felt when I was watching the PC bonus features.The packaging is lovely, though different from that of my other dvds and one other blu-ray I own. On the bright side, it really stands out and looks pretty on my bookshelf.I whole-heartedly recomend this movie and this blu-ray/dvd combo-pack copy of it to anyone, young or old, who loves fairytales/fantasy. It is not just a kid's film, but it will keep a kid entertained. And it's very heartwarming/moving.

194868,A3PN7RBZWFN1GL,1616842490,"A. Nadeau ""lil mi mi""","[12, 14]","The Chronicles of Narnia have been my favorite books since I was 5. When I saw that they were putting those beloved pages ont he big screen I was both delighted and fearful. When I saw the first movie, I notived the spot where they changed the storyline a bit, call it artistic license, so that it would flow better as a movie.  The changes were minimal and didn't alter the story itself.  I was Okal with that.  The second movie was quite a bit altered, but again, I could see where they may have seen the changes as necessary to help it flow right on the big screen. It was well done, and overall I could accept it, although I did gripe about some missing details, and some farther out scenes.This one though... What were they thinking? For every Narnia lover that I've known, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the favorite of the books. It's the kind of book that you have dreams about and want to re-read the second you finish it.  Not only did they alter the storyline, they added a complete central theme that never existed.  They downplayed some very essential parts, and added a bunch of crud that they must have thought necessary, but destroyed the entire story as far as I'm concerned.My children, my husband and myself left the theater feeling completely cheated and wondering why they felt the need to wreck the best story ever. I expected there to be some challenges with certain effects, or with putting into pictures certain things that is left to each individual's imagination, that happens in most movies, but the book flows beautifully as it is. The added story line that, I guess, was supposed to help the flow, was entirely arbitrary, unnecessary, and made no sense.  Personally, it ticked me off.I suppose, if you've never read the book, and never intend to, and don't mind your kids never reading it either, it was a tollerable movie on it's own... If you are a lover of the books and actually want the story, read it... of if you really want it on the screen, the BBC made a low budget version back in the 80s or 90s that is true to the story, despite the bad special effects.",2,What were they thinking?,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,2099,"['Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'have', 'been', 'favorite', 'books', 'was', '5', 'When', 'saw', 'were', 'putting', 'beloved', 'pages', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'delighted', 'fearful', 'When', 'saw', 'first', 'movie', 'notived', 'spot', 'where', 'changed', 'storyline', 'bit', 'call', 'artistic', 'license', 'would', 'flow', 'better', 'movie', 'changes', 'were', 'minimal', 'did', ""n't"", 'alter', 'story', 'was', 'Okal', 'second', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'altered', 'again', 'could', 'see', 'where', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'changes', 'necessary', 'help', 'flow', 'right', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'overall', 'could', 'accept', 'did', 'gripe', 'missing', 'details', 'farther', 'out', 'scenes.This', 'one', 'though', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'Narnia', 'lover', ""'ve"", 'known', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'favorite', 'books', 'kind', 'book', 'have', 'dreams', 'want', 're-read', 'second', 'finish', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'alter', 'storyline', 'added', 'complete', 'central', 'theme', 'never', 'existed', 'downplayed', 'very', 'essential', 'parts', 'added', 'bunch', 'crud', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'necessary', 'destroyed', 'entire', 'story', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned.My', 'children', 'husband', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'completely', 'cheated', 'wondering', 'why', 'felt', 'need', 'wreck', 'best', 'story', 'ever', 'expected', 'be', 'challenges', 'certain', 'effects', 'putting', 'pictures', 'certain', 'things', 'left', 'individual', 'imagination', 'most', 'movies', 'book', 'beautifully', 'added', 'story', 'line', 'guess', 'was', 'supposed', 'help', 'flow', 'was', 'entirely', 'arbitrary', 'unnecessary', 'made', 'sense', 'Personally', 'ticked', 'off.I', 'suppose', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'never', 'intend', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'kids', 'never', 'reading', 'either', 'was', 'tollerable', 'movie', 'own', 'are', 'lover', 'books', 'actually', 'want', 'story', 'read', 'really', 'want', 'screen', 'BBC', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'version', 'back', '80s', '90s', 'true', 'story', 'bad', 'special', 'effects']",N/A

194894,AOJQ4MJARK7V3,1616842490,Book Junkie,"[2, 4]","I really enjoyed this movie when it came out, and I hope they make the next one.  The movie stays fairly close to the book.  It does focus more on the mist than the search for the seven lords of Narnia, but that didn't bother me that much.  The mist and their quest to stop it is in the book. It's just the book gives it more a secondary nature and focuses on finding the seven lords of Telmar, whereas the movie reverses that making the mist primary and the seven lords secondary. But the movie does keep all of the stops that they make along the way in there. The only other thing left out that was in the book is the meeting of the star's father.  In the book when they reach Aslan's table they meet two people, the female star and her father.  In the movie they left out her father and the explanation that he is a fallen star.  But that's small potatoes.Heinley and Keenes do a great job falling back into their roles as Lucy & Edmund.  I loved Poulter as Eustance.  He does an excellent job as the annoying, bratty cousin.  And you do just want to smack him when you first see him.The movie did keep the themes that were in the book: Lucy realizing that she is more important than she gives herself credit for and special in her own right; Edmund learning to let go of his pride and step aside; Caspian once again learning to lead & humility, though the display of anger he shows at the end of the book when he is denied going to see Aslan is left out of the movie; stopping evil and resisting temptation; and Eustance learning humility and kindness.  And as always, Repicheep is the sword wielding mouse who believes in honor. And I thought that the movie did a good job in showing how Repicheep's and Eustance's friendship forms. Though they did leave out Eustance swinging Repicheep by the tale.All in all, the movie is very well done and has a lot of humor and action to it as well as some very heart-warming elements. It is worth going to see and I plan on buying it when it comes out.  I do hope that they make The Silver Chair into a movie.

194895,A1YB29BIDULEYE,1616842490,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","If you watch the old 1979 animated ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" you will see that it mostly follows the book. And now and then, you will see a slight difference. (In the book, Father Christmas gives the children their weapons. In the 1979 animated film, Aslan gives them their weapons.)Well, this is a case where the film is VERY different from the book, and now and then, you see something in the film that is also in the book. To say the least, the older 80s BBC version of ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is more accurate.Alright. I got that out of my system. All of that said, this is a rare case where the differences seem to be done with taste, and the story is still very beautiful. I'll try not to make too many comparisons to the book. (Because then, this review would go on forever.)Edmund and Lucy are not too happy about staying with their cousin Eustace. To say the least, he's a constant and rude complainer. They soon get sucked into Narnia and run into King Caspian and the fighting mouse Reepicheep on their ship the Dawn Treader. Caspian is looking for the 7 lords who fled during the reign of Miraz. Reepicheep and Eustace start to bicker with words, and later swords. But somehow, we know they are going to reconcile.They run across slave traders but make their escape with the help of Reepicheep. To make a long story short, they have to find the 7 swords of the lords Caspian is looking for, and place them at the table of Aslan. It sounds simple, but there is one little catch. There is an evil fog out there that will tempt them with their darkest desires.To complicate things further, Eustace (falling to temptation) is turned into a dragon. And suddenly, he becomes a tragic and sympathetic character who wants to help. Reepicheep's compassion to Eustace (now a dragon) is especially touching. And while we AT FIRST were annoyed by Eustace, we were then lead into sympathy for him. And now we find ourselves cheering for him as he tries to help. GREAT FORMULA!!!I don't want to go much further, because then I might ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. But Aslan has that beautiful moment (as he does in the book) where he explains that he is in our world, but we have to learn to know him by the name he carries in our world.If you read the book, you will know that there are SEVERAL MAJOR CHANGES. Without going through the whole list, the mission in the book is eventually to sail to the end of the world, while in the film it's to place the 7 swords at the table of Aslan. In the book, it's Ramandu who gives the mission. In the film, it's Coriakin. (In fact, Ramandu is nowhere to be seen.) Some may be annoyed that in the book, it's Caspian who is tempted by the water that turns all to gold, while in the film, it's Edmund who is tempted by it. Finally, some may be upset that while Eustace complained a lot in the book, some of what he wrote in his journals was valid. The film seems to deny him this.Probably for the better, Eustace stays a dragon longer in the film, fights side by side with Reepicheep and is allowed the chance of finishing the job and saving everyone. Another change that seems to work is that Edmund has a vision that kind of foreshadows the evil queen in the next story ""The Silver Chair."" (If they choose to make the film that is.)Another change that works is that Reepicheep has a beautiful moment where he speaks with Aslan. There is even a brief line at the end that will prepare us for the next story, which is of course ""The Silver Chair."" (""Jill Pole is here."")Even though it doesn't really follow the book much, it is certainly a wonderful film. What is funny is that Eustace was such a complainer in this story. And in ""The Silver Chair,"" he will have to deal with the constant complainer Puddleglum.

""I'm a king,"" he grumbles.  ""I've fought wars...""  ""Not in this world,"" Lucy reminds him.In fact, Edmund and Lucy are engaged in a kind of guerrilla war, with their priggish, overintellectual, pragmatic cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter), who dislikes them almost as much as they do him.  Then a seascape in Lucy's tiny attic room transforms into real seawater and all three find themselves back in Narnia, being plucked out of its Eastern Ocean by the crew of the ship Dawn Treader.  In command is their old friend King Caspian (Ben Barnes), who has set out to find seven noblemen loyal to his father who fled their homeland when his uncle seized the throne.  For him, it's been three years since he saw them, and all Narnia is at peace.  ""But if there are no wars to fight, and no one is in danger,"" wonders Edmund, ""why are we here?""As it turns out, all the Narnian world may be in danger.  In this, the movie actually improves upon C. S. Lewis's original, as it posits the existence of Dark Island, a place ruled by an ever-growing evil that seeks to absorb and destroy everything good.  Caspian and his friends--including Reepicheep, the knightly Talking Mouse (Simon Pegg)--must find the ancient swords carried by the missing lords and lay them at Aslan's Table in order to destroy it.  On the way each of them will be tempted by the green mist that serves as the evil's eyes and ears; they will battle the slavers who have taken over the isolated Lone Islands, meet a wizard with words of warning and a star's daughter with more, and fight a sea serpent, and Eustace will learn something of swordsmanship, courtesy, and chivalry, and be transformed into a dragon--a shape that enables him to save the day twice, and thereby makes him more human than he ever was before.

194916,A18G7GG53G2X8A,1616842490,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","So there I was, sitting in my seat at the theater awaiting the start of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" the third film in the series. As I tore open the plastic bag containing a set of 3D glasses, I came to a worrying realization: Although I remembered greatly enjoying the previous ""Narnia"" film, ""Prince Caspian,"" I had by now forgotten just about everything concerning the plot and the characters. Would that mean I would be lost watching this new film? Fantasies are a great cinematic distraction, but if they're part of an epic series released over several years, keeping track of key events can be next to impossible. To my surprise and relief, the film makes the occasional reference to previous events but doesn't dwell upon them. In other words, I was allowed to forget the previous films, sit back, and immerse myself in nearly two hours of pure entertainment.Adapted from the novel by C.S. Lewis, ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" begins with a painting that gushes water into a bedroom and ends with a battle between a ship and a sea serpent; in between, we encounter fairy tale creatures, witness acts of magic, and follow the leads on a quest to save Narnia - and themselves - from slave trading and the forces of darkness. I guess what I'm saying is that this movie is a fun, exciting, great-looking fantasy adventure that adults and children will enjoy. That it has joined the 3D bandwagon is really of no concern to me, since the process is now about as commonplace as drive-in theaters were fifty years ago. See it in that format if that's what you prefer. I personally think everyone would be much better off saving themselves a couple of bucks and sticking to traditional 2D.At the beginning of the film, we find the youngest Pevensie siblings, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley), spending the summer holiday with their uncle and insufferable cousin, Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter), who does nothing but complain, complain, complain. Their older siblings, Susan and Peter (cameos by Anna Popplewell and William Moseley), have matured enough to start living their own lives; Susan in particular has joined her parents on a trip to America. Thanks to a painting of a ship at sea, Edmund, Lucy, and cousin Eustace are transported back to Narnia where they board the ""Dawn Treader"" and reunite with King Caspian (Ben Barnes, who seems to have forgotten the Spanish accent he used in the previous film) and the swashbuckling talking mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg).Caspian's mission is to seek out the Seven Lost Lords of Narnia. The Pevensies are happy to tag along, but Eustace is not; he's far too rational and proper to believe that a magical world could ever exist. As he continues to make life difficult for everyone, the ""Dawn Treader"" sails from one island to the next claiming the swords of the Lost Lords with the intent of gathering them at the table of the great lion Lord Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson). Our intrepid leads will engage in a number of harrowing adventures, including encounters with a band of slave traders, one-legged troll creatures, a pond that turns ordinary objects into gold, an evil green mist, and a dark island that can bring to life one's darkest fears. Caspian and the Pevensies will have to resist temptation numerous times along the way; Lucy must not wish herself as beautiful as her sister, Edmund must not hunger for more power, and Caspian must not think he was a disappointment to his father.Since the Pevensies have been well established, let's focus on Eustace. Say the word ""Eustace"" - does it not sound an awful lot like ""useless""? At the start, he's exactly that. But then he goes through ... a transformation, and by the end of the film, he proves himself more useful than most of the other characters combined. He initially has a contentious relationship with Reepicheep, who continuously taunts him for his profound lack of adventure and skill. In due time, they will become friends, which is just about right for this kind of film. As for Poulter's performance, he has the whiny, stuck up, snot-nosed twit stereotype down to a tee.There's an unfortunate tendency for fantasy epics - especially ones adapted from books - to be so overloaded with material that they alienate general audiences and appeal only to those intimately familiar with their sources. What I've been enjoying about the ""Narnia"" films is that, while all connected by recurring characters and themes, each chapter is generally self contained. ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" could have easily existed within a closed universe, defined by a plot that only an elite few would understand or care about. Fortunately, director Michael Apted and writers Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, and Michael Petroni had all audiences in mind. This includes people like me, people who like a film at the moment it's being watched but don't necessarily retain any information about them.",4,Lead Us Not Into Temptation,1291939200,"12 10,

Really in the book they're just sailing from island to island on a whim Caspian had to find the missing lords when he should be, you know, helping lead his newly reunited country. I remember seeing the first preview and having my mother ask if it followed the book. ""Not really,"" I replied, ""but it looks like they've managed to squeeze some actual plot in there.""They've given the characers a conflict to resolve and an enemy to defeat while still remaining true to the book's very episodic style. As characters go they've been developed nicely, with one exception. Lucy is given great inner conflict that was based off a very brief passage in the book, it really adds depth to her otherwise young but trusting character, she is also given a very touching role with a new character invented for the movie. Caspian seems much more like a ruler and leader than he did in the last movie (but where did his accent go?). Eustace was everything he could have been and more, a totally wonderful addition to the cast! Edmund, however, fared much worse. Possibly because he is my favorite character but it felt like they were pushing the jealousy bit too far. I can't think of a logical precedent for this in the books, however it may just be a natural assumption that he is tired of playing second fiddle. Hmmmm...

194921,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,1616842490,C. Sawin,"[2, 5]","The Chronicles of Narnia have always been a fairly big aspect of my life seeing how their my mom's favorite books. I really only remember reading the first book growing up, but also really enjoyed it. The new films came along and The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was just both a faithful adaptation and an exceptional film, but then Prince Caspian was released and (other than the glorious escapades of Reepicheep) was rather subpar overall and fell flat especially in comparison to the rather stellar first film. As production began on The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, problems arose including a switch in studios from Disney to Fox. The real question would be if Dawn Treader could actually recapture the magic that seemed to be absent in the previous film.Edmund (Keynes) and Lucy (Henley) are now living with their cousin, Eustace (Poulter), who is less than thrilled that his cousins are now invading his home while Peter (Moseley) and Susan (Popplewell) are currently in the US having their own adventures outside of Narnia. Just when Edmund and Lucy begin to feel envious of Peter and Susan, a rather Narnian looking painting featuring a sea vessel in the hungry ocean begins to leak water and eventually brings the three into Narnia. They are brought onto a ship known as the Dawn Treader where they're reunited with Caspian (Barnes), who's now king of Narnia and the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (now voiced by Simon Pegg). Their voyage leads them to the Eastern Islands where they'll encounter the likes of slave traders, a green mist that seems to acquire sacrifices, invisible enemies, horrific sea monsters, and their deepest, darkest fears becoming a terrifying reality. Their mission has the fate of Narnia resting in their hands while their voyage has the possibility of leading them into uncharted waters and discovering Aslan's Country.Eustace Scrubb is a character that gets on your last nerve. You honestly just want to slap him and see him left behind countless times in the film, but he eventually becomes more tolerable and gives Reepicheep something to do. Not only is he bearable by the end of the film, but almost likable. So if irritating characters are a turn off to you like they are to me, I can safely say that it at least pays off this time around. It wasn't even noticeable that Simon Pegg took over the voice acting duties for Reepicheep from Eddie Izzard. I honestly had no idea there was a change in actors until after I saw the film. So it was a pretty flawless transition all around. Reepicheep is just such a likable character. It's hard not to love any scene he's a part of and it's fairly incredible that a change in actors didn't influence that in the slightest.Narnia itself looks just as elegant and enchanting as ever. WETA Workshop proves yet again that they're one of the best special effects handlers working in film today. Most notably is the hair on these talking animals. I have no idea what the ratio is between make-up effects and CG, but it's yet another transition in the film that is flawless. There's a minotaur on the crew of the Dawn Treader that is your typical awesome big guy character, but also looks amazing when he talks. Not to mention he throws in a few one liners that are laugh out loud funny. The special effects have never looked better this time around despite the noted production difficulties.The most noteworthy thing about The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is that it's incredibly engaging. The film is just shy of being two hours long, but doesn't feel long or drawn out in the slightest and keeps you thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. While watching Prince Caspian, I was doing several other things at once and the film still felt long, drawn out, and most of all just really distant from the source material (watching it with someone who read the books multiple times and continued to rant about how this didn't happen or that is fairly entertaining in itself). Dawn Treader felt like it's at least gone back to the roots of the franchise and actually delivers another fantastic Narnia film. The film also packs an emotional punch. The ending is borderline heart wrenching as you don't want the adventure to end. It's just an extremely extraordinary and engrossing fantasy film.The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a much needed bounce back after the disappointing Prince Caspian and delivers a surprisingly great film that exceeds expectations. It's an exceptional journey that tugs at your heart strings, is completely absorbing, features some fantastic special effects, and is most of all a worthy sequel to an already well-established franchise. The film invoked emotions in me I haven't felt since seeing Toy Story 3 earlier this year. Much like the books, Dawn Treader takes hold of your imagination and doesn't let go until it's all over. It effectively regains the magic that was lost in Prince Caspian.",4,Exceeds expectations and delivers one of the last surprise hits of the year,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,4928,"['Chronicles',

They are not on any kind of central plastic retainers but slid into the cardboard sides like the oft scratched cheaply enveloped $1 DVDs sold at Walmart and Dollar stores - ONLY THIS IS MUCH WORSE AS THE GLUE HOLDING THE SIDES TOGETHER GETS ALL OVER THE SURFACE OF THE DISCS LIKE NON-DRYING CONTACT CEMENT!  With care I was able to extract the discs and with a clean micro-fiber cloth polished off the glue on their surfaces leaving them clean and unscratched.  I then used the spatula again to open the sides up enough to accept some plastic DVD/CD envelopes to keep the glue from resticking to the discs but I had to trim off the corners of the envelopes to get them in and stand any chance of extracting them again.Being really POed about the experience I am posting to prevent this from happening to others.

194927,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,1616842490,David Bower,"[1, 1]","As have many others, I too have enjoyed the Chronicles of Narnia series and have read the books more than once. I'm a devotee of following the story timeline chronology instead of the writing chronology. If you're not aware of the significance of that distinction I'll freely admit I wasn't aware of it either until after I'd read the series the first time following the timeline of the story. I had purchased a guide to Narnia book and discovered there were two distinct camps of Narnia followers, one who felt the books should be read in the order written, and the other who felt the proper order was to follow the story timeline.Having read all seven stories in the story timeline order I felt following that sequence made the most sense; for example where did the light post in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" come from and did it have any significance. That's all explained in the first book in the story timeline order, ""The Magician's Nephew.""Following the story timeline order ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is book two; ""Prince Caspian"" is book 4, and ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is book five. Book six is called ""The Silver Chair"" and book seven is called ""The Last Battle."" To complete the series, book three is called ""The Horse and His Boy.""This Blu-ray version of the movie has first class sound and video and tells an exciting version of C. S. Lewis's story; the movie is enjoyable and easy to watch and goes by very quickly. On it's own it is entertaining although it has departures from the written story.I must confess that the first Narnia movie out was the catalyst that prompted me to buy the series in book form. Amazon offers the volume I bought and it is called ""The Complete Chronicles of Narnia"" and is a beautifully done volume for children or adults with pictures and maps; I recommend it highly for personal use or as a gift. I'm looking at my copy as I write this.I am a dedicated science fiction fan and only occasionally delve into fantasy; the exceptions to my science fiction have been ""The Chronicle of Narnia,"" The Harry Potter books, ""The Lord of the Rings"" and related books, and ""The Sword of Truth"" books. All four of these fantasy series have been worthwhile and have provided hours of entertaining reading.The very best I could hope for you is to discover the books if you have not already done so; as is always the case, the books are rich with detail which must be eliminated with movie time constraints. I'll be one of the first to admit that the books are much more interesting than the movies; the movies have done a good job of hinting at what the books contain but that is all.I believe the Narnia stories would be outstanding for children who enjoy reading as they present high ethical and moral ideals at a time when children are more open to suggestion. The distinction between good and evil is clearly drawn.Should there be no more Narnia movies I urge you to take advantage of this opportunity to whet a child's appetite for reading and help them discover how these adventures started and how they ended.",4,Begin a Wondrous Voyage that Goes Beyond Dawn Treader,1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,3080,"['have', 'many', 'others', 'too', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'series', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'more', 'once', ""'m"", 'devotee', 'following', 'story', 'timeline', 'chronology', 'instead', 'writing', 'chronology', ""'re"", 'not', 'aware', 'significance', 'distinction', ""'ll"", 'freely', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', ""'d"", 'read', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'following', 'timeline', 'story', 'had', 'purchased', 'guide', 'Narnia', 'book', 'discovered', 'were', 'two', 'distinct', 'camps', 'Narnia', 'followers', 'one', 'who', 'felt', 'books', 'should', 'be', 'read', 'order', 'written', 'other', 'who', 'felt', 'proper', 'order', 'was', 'follow', 'story', 'timeline.Having', 'read', 'seven', 'stories', 'story', 'timeline', 'order', 'felt', 'following', 'sequence', 'made', 'most', 'sense', 'example', 'where', 'did', 'light', 'post', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'come', 'did', 'have', 'significance', 'explained', 'first', 'book', 'story', 'timeline', 'order', 'Magician', 'Nephew', 'Following', 'story', 'timeline', 'order', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'book', 'two', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'book', '4', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'book', 'five', 'Book', 'six', 'called', 'Silver', 'Chair', 'book', 'seven', 'called', 'Last', 'Battle', 'complete', 'series', 'book', 'three', 'called', 'Horse', 'Boy', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'movie', 'first', 'class', 'sound', 'video', 'exciting', 'version', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'story', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'easy', 'watch', 'very', 'quickly', 'own', 'entertaining', 'departures', 'written', 'story.I', 'must', 'confess', 'first', 'Narnia', 'movie', 'out', 'was', 'catalyst', 'prompted', 'buy', 'series', 'book', 'form', 'Amazon', 'volume', 'bought', 'called', 'Complete', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'beautifully', 'done', 'volume', 'children', 'adults', 'pictures', 'maps', 'recommend', 'highly', 'personal', 'use', 'gift', ""'m"", 'looking', 'copy', 'write', 'this.I', 'am', 'dedicated', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'only', 'occasionally', 'delve', 'fantasy', 'exceptions', 'science', 'fiction', 'have', 'been', 'Chronicle', 'Narnia', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'related', 'books', 'Sword', 'Truth', 'books', 'four', 'fantasy', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'worthwhile', 'have', 'provided', 'hours', 'entertaining', 'reading.The', 'very', 'best', 'could', 'hope', 'discover', 'books', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'always', 'case', 'books', 'are', 'rich', 'detail', 'must', 'be', 'eliminated', 'movie', 'time', 'constraints', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'first', 'admit', 'books', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'movies', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'hinting', 'what', 'books', 'contain', 'all.I', 'believe', 'Narnia', 'stories', 'would', 'be', 'outstanding', 'children', 'who', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'present', 'high', 'ethical', 'moral', 'ideals', 'time', 'when', 'children', 'are', 'more', 'open', 'suggestion', 'distinction', 'good', 'evil', 'clearly', 'drawn.Should', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'Narnia', 'movies', 'urge', 'take', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'whet', 'child', 'appetite', 'reading', 'help', 'discover', 'how', 'adventures', 'started', 'how', 'ended']",N/A

194929,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,1616842490,Derek,"[1, 1]","To start out bluntly, this was not my favorite film in the series, but it was overall an enjoyable experience.The third film in The Chronicles of Narnia franchise follows Lucy, Edmund, and their annoying cousin Eustice back into the world of Narnia where they meet up with Prince Caspian and set out to find seven magical swords that have the power to dispel a rising darkness.The first thing that caught my attention in this film was the change of hands from Disney over to 20th Century Fox. This worried me. It seems that Disney, despite having the ability to make several hundred Air Bud films and spinoffs, decided to pass off the sequels to another company for budget reasons. But the film did not lose any quality or sense of Narnia-ness with the transfer.Continuing forward, the special effects in the film were gorgeous and there are some pretty visually stunning scenes. No expense was spared in the effects department. The acting was well done by both veterans and novices. The music, while not as captivating as the first film's, was good. So, not a bad film...but...There were a couple of things that I disliked about the film. The first one being the flow of the film. This may sound like an oxymoron, but the movie moved pretty slow for the most part because of how fast things were happening. It seemed that the characters would sail from one place to the next, staying for a very brief time, and without any real good purpose for stopping. Very little seemed to happen at each place and because of the lack of adventure, it just seemed to drag on. I think the film would have been a lot more interesting if the characters did more at each place and if we got to spend a little more time exploring the character's weaknesses along the way. Slow down, let us get to know more about what's going on.**Spoiler Alert**Second dislike: The moment where the characters have made it to the dark island and Edmund conjures up the evil creature from his mind. I expected to see the Stay Puft marshmallow man instead of the eel-like creature since the scene was almost played exactly fromGhostbusters. The idea could have been pulled off fine, it was just the way they scripted it: One guy is warning everyone to clear their minds of fears and then Edmund apologizes for conjuring up the evil demon. It almost would have been cooler to see Mr. Stay Puft make an entrance...**End Spoiler Alert**So, while not the best in the series, it was still a worth-while film to watch and a good time for everyone who sees it.[...]",3,"Not the best, but enjoyable",1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,2523,"['start', 'out', 'bluntly', 'was', 'not', 'favorite', 'film', 'series', 'was', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'experience.The', 'third', 'film', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'franchise', 'Lucy', 'Edmund', 'annoying', 'cousin', 'Eustice', 'back', 'world', 'Narnia', 'where', 'meet', 'up', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'seven', 'magical', 'swords', 'have', 'power', 'dispel', 'rising', 'darkness.The', 'first', 'thing', 'caught', 'attention', 'film', 'was', 'change', 'hands', 'Disney', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'worried', 'Disney', 'having', 'ability', 'make', 'several', 'hundred', 'Air', 'Bud', 'films', 'spinoffs', 'decided', 'pass', 'off', 'sequels', 'company', 'budget', 'reasons', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'lose', 'quality', 'sense', 'Narnia-ness', 'transfer.Continuing', 'forward', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'are', 'pretty', 'visually', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'effects', 'department', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'veterans', 'novices', 'music', 'not', 'as', 'captivating', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'So', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'were', 'couple', 'things', 'disliked', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'being', 'flow', 'film', 'may', 'sound', 'oxymoron', 'movie', 'moved', 'pretty', 'slow', 'most', 'part', 'how', 'fast', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'seemed', 'characters', 'would', 'sail', 'one', 'place', 'next', 'staying', 'very', 'brief', 'time', 'real', 'good', 'purpose', 'stopping', 'Very', 'little', 'seemed', 'happen', 'place', 'lack', 'adventure', 'just', 'seemed', 'drag', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'did', 'more', 'place', 'got', 'spend', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'exploring', 'character', 'weaknesses', 'way', 'Slow', 'down', 'let', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'what', 'going', '**Spoiler', 'Alert**Second', 'dislike', 'moment', 'where', 'characters', 'have', 'made', 'dark', 'island', 'Edmund', 'up', 'evil', 'creature', 'mind', 'expected', 'see', 'Stay', 'Puft', 'marshmallow', 'man', 'instead', 'eel-like', 'creature', 'scene', 'was', 'almost', 'played', 'exactly', 'fromGhostbusters', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'off', 'fine', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'scripted', 'One', 'guy', 'warning', 'everyone', 'clear', 'minds', 'fears', 'then', 'Edmund', 'conjuring', 'up', 'evil', 'demon', 'almost', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cooler', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Stay', 'Puft', 'make', 'entrance', 'Spoiler', 'Alert**So', 'not', 'best', 'series', 'was', 'still', 'worth-while', 'film', 'watch', 'good', 'time', 'everyone', 'who', 'it.', '[', ']']",N/A

The first half of the movie is rather choppy and rushed, but the second half blossoms into a solid adventure yarn with sorcerers, dragons and a nameless evil lurking near the end of the world.Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) have been sent to stay with their relatives, including their noxious cousin Eustace (Will Poulter). But then a mysterious painting whisks them into Narnia -- right next to a Narnian ship, the Dawn Treader. King Caspian (Ben Barnes) is on a quest to retrieve seven exiled Narnian lords (and their enchanted swords).But they soon find that something is spreading through the Lone Islands -- a malevolent green mist that begins to mess with the Dawn Treader's crew. The only way to defeat it is to lay the swords on the table of Aslan (Liam Neeson). They must grapple with some terrible obstacles -- slavers, magical water, invisible foes and cursed treasure that causes a horrifying transformation in Eustace -- if they have any chance of victory...""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is one of those movies that requires patience. The first half is kind of choppy -- we're given a string of episodic subplots that usually end pretty quickly, and which are pretty rushed (the whole slavery-island thing takes about TEN MINUTES!). I don't blame director Michael Apted, though, since C.S. Lewis' book was even MORE episodic.However, the movie becomes smoother and more streamlined in the second half. Suddenly we have a solid intermingling of religious symbolism (both dark and light), some humor (""I'm a pacifist-"" ""EN GARDE!""), and a truly epic sea battle as the climax (including the most grotesque sea serpent I've ever seen in a movie -- knotty green blubber-skin and a mouthful of spidery tentacles).Keynes and Henley give strong performances as two kids on the cusp of adulthood -- Lucy struggles with her envy for her sister (even stealing a magic spell), and Edmund feels that he isn't appreciated as a man. And Caspian -- now sporting a hot little beard and piratey clothes -- has to deal with his daddy issues, and even gets a love interest near the end.And Poulter gives a very impressive performance as Eustace -- his character starts out as a fusty, annoying little twerp, but a magical transformation helps turn him into a very different person.

The third installment of the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" takes the two youngest Pevensies and Eustace back to Narnia. (Peter and Susan are considered too old to return, and are in America on a trip.) This time they join Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), now king, on a voyage to find out what became of the seven lords that Caspian's uncle conveniently got rid of lest they overthrow him.  At least that was the book version.  In the movie, there's an added plot about magic swords and a creepy island.  Most of the stuff that happens in the book happens here, albeit with a ton of special effects, but not in the same order.  The ending stays true to the books, though.The bad news is that if you love(d) the books just as they are, you probably won't be happy with this version.  For example: Eustace turns into a dragon and stays that way much longer than in the book.  The scene inside the Magician's home, in which Lucy has to consult his spell book on behalf of the Dufflepuds, is much shorter and comes near the beginning.  Also, Lucy has this fixation on becoming as beautiful as Susan; in the books, this was limited to a single scene.  They also omit the scene where she recites a spell to see what her school friends really think of her - something on which Aslan calls her later and would`ve made a good Life Lesson, if you ask me.  But Life Lessons abound here anyway.  You can't watch the movie and not Learn Something Important.

I haven't read the novel, but there's just so much in the movie that is introduced quickly and then dismissed, like Coriakin the magician. I imagine the novel has some background on these characters, such as WHO they are.

It featured seagoing adventure, island exploration, and some great humor with the old dwarf on the docks and the unforgettable Reepicheep. Imagine my excitement to hear the third Narnia movie would be made.Michael Apted lends the film a sure hand, and the children actors are all good in their roles, though the Eustace part is somewhat slapstick at points. The movie draws us into Narnia in a magical way, and I was thrilled to be there once more. With the arrival of the Dawn Treader, I knew I was in for some fun. And yes, in many ways, this third installment builds on the fun, warmhearted, good vs. evil elements of the first. While I personally liked ""Prince Caspian,"" I enjoyed ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" a bit more, and so it was nice to see here that same imaginative and colorful version of our favorite fanciful land. Many of the book's strong points are on display.My few quibbles have to do with the quick romps past the Dufflepuds and some of the island sequences, with time spent instead on building a climactic ending. The ending does mostly succeed, but we've seen these types of conflicts with sea monsters before, and often more dramatically, such as in ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" My other complaint is that the dragon's peeling away that is so meaningful and symbolic in the book loses a lot of its power. The idea is present in the movie, but it backs away from the personal contact from Aslan. While this could be admittedly hard for small children to understand, it is so key to the scene's depth.We bought the two-disc edition for Easter. The second disc has about 45 minutes of extras, with some interviews, making of a scene, island information, and a sword-matching game. It's worth the extra $5, but it lacks the detail and complete world exploration that is found in the extra ""Lord of the Ring"" DVDs, for example.Overall, Apted gives us a thoroughly fun, funny, engaging, and heartwarming story. Although it set up a segue into ""The Silver Chair"" (another of my favorite Narnia books), it looks like the next movie, if it's to be made, will be ""The Magician's Nephew.""

I paid for the film, this is annoying.In the film itself the younger Pevensy children, Lucy and Edmund and their sour cousin Eustace are dropped into the land of Narnia, or rather the sea near Narnia, a magical land where animals talk and trees walk, and discover three years have passed since their adventures in Prince Caspian. Caspian has established his power and has now set out to find seven nobles who had been loyal to his father and were therefore exiled by his usurping uncle.  Along the way they learn that an evil is growing in the east and this can only be stopped if each of the magical swords carried by the lords can be placed on a certain table.Particularly good in the movie are Georgie Henley in her third outing as Lucy wonderfully covering the awkwardness of changing from girl to woman and Simon Pegg as the voice of Reepicheep the mouse. More subdued than Lewis' overly proud cavalier he still steals any scene he's in.On it's own and if you never read the book by Lewis this works. I'll put aside my prejudice and say, it works. BUT that is only if you never read the books. If you have it is right off the beam. We accept that a movie makes some concessions from a book but not a whole hog addition of plots! In the book it is enough that Caspian is looking for the lost lords and the adventures they have along the way lead to their development as people.It is a perfectly good plot. One wonders why the producers failed to learn from their mistake with Prince Caspian. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe pretty faithfully followed Lewis' plot and was a big hit.  `Caspian didn't and was a flop.  Lewis knew how to tell a good story. That is why his books are popular 60+ years later. There was neither need nor reason to go off the mark and the result was yet another flop. The film worked for those who hadn't read the books but for those who did we were left wondering `why'd they do this?"" the question has still not been answered.",3,It wasn't broke so why 'fix' it?,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,2446,"['fantasy', 'film', 'family', 'watch', 'Voyager', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'eye', 'popping', 'piece', 'fun', 'will', 'give', 'thrills', 'little', 'ones', 'talking', 'down', 'adults', 'faithful', 'rendering', '3rd', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'books', 'magical', 'land', 'Narnia', 'useless', 'pratt', 'director', 'should', 'be', 'dropped', 'dragon', 'lair', 'first', 'opportunity', 'CD', 'was', 'disappopinting', 'MUST', 'sit', 'commercials', 'get', 'feature', 'Why', 'paid', 'film', 'film', 'younger', 'Pevensy', 'children', 'Lucy', 'Edmund', 'sour', 'cousin', 'Eustace', 'are', 'dropped', 'land', 'Narnia', 'rather', 'sea', 'Narnia', 'magical', 'land', 'where', 'animals', 'talk', 'trees', 'walk', 'discover', 'three', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'adventures', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Caspian', 'established', 'power', 'now', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'seven', 'nobles', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'loyal', 'father', 'were', 'therefore', 'exiled', 'usurping', 'uncle', 'way', 'learn', 'evil', 'growing', 'east', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'stopped', 'magical', 'swords', 'carried', 'lords', 'can', 'be', 'placed', 'certain', 'table.Particularly', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'Georgie', 'Henley', 'third', 'outing', 'Lucy', 'wonderfully', 'covering', 'awkwardness', 'changing', 'girl', 'woman', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'voice', 'Reepicheep', 'mouse', 'More', 'subdued', 'Lewis', 'overly', 'proud', 'cavalier', 'still', 'scene', 'in.On', 'own', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'Lewis', ""'ll"", 'put', 'aside', 'prejudice', 'say', 'BUT', 'only', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'have', 'right', 'beam', 'accept', 'movie', 'concessions', 'book', 'not', 'whole', 'hog', 'addition', 'plots', 'book', 'enough', 'Caspian', 'looking', 'lost', 'lords', 'adventures', 'have', 'way', 'lead', 'development', 'people.It', 'perfectly', 'good', 'plot', 'One', 'why', 'producers', 'failed', 'learn', 'mistake', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'pretty', 'faithfully', 'followed', 'Lewis', 'plot', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'Caspian', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'flop', 'Lewis', 'knew', 'how', 'tell', 'good', 'story', 'why', 'books', 'are', 'popular', '60+', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'need', 'reason', 'go', 'off', 'mark', 'result', 'was', 'yet', 'flop', 'film', 'worked', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'who', 'did', 'were', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', ""'d"", 'do', 'question', 'still', 'not', 'been', 'answered']",N/A

194963,A1UJ8BZ0MYO4G3,1616842490,humanbeldot,"[6, 8]","""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is, for quite a few fans (including myself), the best book of the series. Considering the switching of studios from Disney to 20th Century Fox, expectations were a bit higher than for ""Prince Caspian"" in the hopes that the series would return to its roots. Unfortunately, the attempt to move a fantasy series with lots of underlying Christian elements into the secular community did not fare well, and ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is so far the worst addition to the film series.To avoid rehashing what many other reviewers have already said about this film, I will simply say that the script chosen for it includes a lot of unnecessary elements that bog down what an incredible adventure story. Apparently, a mere adventure in search of the unknown is not exciting enough, so a plot involving seven magic swords and a sentient green mist was added, plus some battle sequences and side-plots that were not there in the first place. Much of the characters' development occurred in the previous films and novels, and ""Dawn Treader"" was originally the story of Eustace and, in a way, Reepicheep. The film also digs up a lot of unnecessary character elements, such as Edmund's continued issues with the White Witch when it was all taken care of long ago.Story elements aside, the special effects are fantastic - the dragon looks almost real, with a nice emphasis on its bright blue eyes to communicate its thoughts and emotions, and the sea serpent (the battle against which was, in spite of not being in this form in the book, a highlight of the film) is terribly ugly and wonderfully worthy of destruction. Aslan continues to look better with each successive film, and now he looks as though he has real weight - a real creature in the same realm as the live-action characters. The minotaur, fauns, the mist, the water, and the Dark Island all look wonderful, and the high-definition Blu-ray transfer makes everything look crystal-clear and quite realistic.Without a doubt, the film looks best on Blu-ray, without the diminished quality or clarity of DVD resolution. The Dawn Treader ship itself and the surrounding ocean, as well the vivid greens of Coriakin's Island, the treasure of Deathweater Island, and the bleached, tropical tones of the Lone Islands, all look best in high-definition video - a simply beautiful transfer that makes the film worth watching in spite of its failures.For the three-disc edition, it is safe to say that the packaging and special features are sub-par. The Blu-ray disc is partially glued in to prevent it sliding out if the case is jostled, so be sure to clean this off before watching or you may experience a freeze somewhere in the film. The extras present on the disc are not really worth looking at - vignettes about the different islands and creatures, the standard fare of ""making of"" clips and at least one theatrical trailer - and seem to exist merely to take up more space on the disc. The DVD has no real special features to speak of other than a commentary and deleted scenes, though the scenes are worth watching for the sake of completionism. The packaging itself and the screens on the discs are very well done, and if handled properly will not cause much problem.Overall, for the sake of clarity and full appreciation of the visual effects, the Blu-ray is well worth having, though a stripped-down single-disc version, if it existed, is preferable to the three-disc monster available now, though in spite of the presence of the Digital Copy disc, there is not much difference in price between the editions. For those with Blu-ray players or PlayStation 3 consoles, you would be best off buying the Blu-ray-only edition.",2,"Great special effects, butchered story, nice Blu-ray transfer",1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,3731,"['Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'quite', 'few', 'fans', 'including', 'best', 'book', 'series', 'Considering', 'switching', 'studios', 'Disney', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'expectations', 'were', 'bit', 'higher', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'hopes', 'series', 'would', 'return', 'roots', 'Unfortunately', 'attempt', 'move', 'fantasy', 'series', 'lots', 'underlying', 'Christian', 'elements', 'secular', 'community', 'did', 'not', 'fare', 'well', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'so', 'far', 'worst', 'addition', 'film', 'series.To', 'avoid', 'rehashing', 'what', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'film', 'will', 'simply', 'say', 'script', 'chosen', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'elements', 'bog', 'down', 'what', 'incredible', 'adventure', 'story', 'Apparently', 'mere', 'adventure', 'search', 'unknown', 'not', 'exciting', 'enough', 'plot', 'involving', 'seven', 'magic', 'swords', 'sentient', 'green', 'mist', 'was', 'added', 'battle', 'sequences', 'side-plots', 'were', 'not', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'Much', 'characters', 'development', 'occurred', 'previous', 'films', 'novels', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'was', 'originally', 'story', 'Eustace', 'way', 'Reepicheep', 'film', 'also', 'up', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'character', 'elements', 'such', 'Edmund', 'continued', 'issues', 'White', 'Witch', 'when', 'was', 'taken', 'care', 'long', 'ago.Story', 'elements', 'aside', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'dragon', 'almost', 'real', 'nice', 'emphasis', 'bright', 'blue', 'eyes', 'communicate', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'sea', 'serpent', 'battle', 'was', 'spite', 'not', 'being', 'form', 'book', 'highlight', 'film', 'terribly', 'ugly', 'wonderfully', 'worthy', 'destruction', 'Aslan', 'look', 'better', 'successive', 'film', 'now', 'real', 'weight', 'real', 'creature', 'same', 'realm', 'live-action', 'characters', 'minotaur', 'fauns', 'mist', 'water', 'Dark', 'Island', 'look', 'wonderful', 'high-definition', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'everything', 'look', 'crystal-clear', 'quite', 'realistic.Without', 'doubt', 'film', 'best', 'Blu-ray', 'diminished', 'quality', 'clarity', 'DVD', 'resolution', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'ship', 'surrounding', 'ocean', 'as', 'well', 'vivid', 'greens', 'Coriakin', 'Island', 'treasure', 'Deathweater', 'Island', 'bleached', 'tropical', 'tones', 'Lone', 'Islands', 'look', 'best', 'high-definition', 'video', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'spite', 'failures.For', 'three-disc', 'edition', 'safe', 'say', 'packaging', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'sub-par', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'partially', 'glued', 'prevent', 'sliding', 'out', 'case', 'jostled', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'clean', 'off', 'watching', 'may', 'experience', 'freeze', 'somewhere', 'film', 'extras', 'present', 'disc', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'looking', 'vignettes', 'different', 'islands', 'creatures', 'standard', 'fare', 'making', 'clips', 'least', 'one', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'seem', 'exist', 'merely', 'take', 'up', 'more', 'space', 'disc', 'DVD', 'real', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'other', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'sake', 'completionism', 'packaging', 'screens', 'discs', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'handled', 'properly', 'will', 'not', 'cause', 'much', 'problem.Overall', 'sake', 'clarity', 'full', 'appreciation', 'visual', 'effects', 'Blu-ray', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'stripped-down', 'single-disc', 'version', 'existed', 'preferable', 'three-disc', 'monster', 'available', 'now', 'spite', 'presence', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'disc', 'not', 'much', 'difference', 'price', 'editions', 'Blu-ray', 'players', 'PlayStation', '3', 'consoles', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'buying', 'Blu-ray-only', 'edition']",N/A

194970,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,1616842490,Jason,"[71, 83]","Right off the top, if you're looking for a literal book-to-movie adaptation, you're going to be very disappointed.  Aslan may as well be a tiger.  There are countless modifications that did not completely align with the book and numerous subtleties noticeable to anyone familiar with the story.For the most part, however, TVOTDT stayed true to form, following Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) - along with their easy to hate cousin Eustace (Will Poulter) - through the fabric of a family painting and into the vast tapestry of the Narnian world created by C.S. Lewis and onto the Dawn Treader (the ship in the painting).  Aboard the ship the join forces with recently crowned - a year in Earthly time, and three in Narnia - King Caspian (Ben Barnes) who, along with his crew of sentient beasts and willing sailors, seeks out seven Telmarine lords and swords.  Almost immediately after they board the Dawn Treader, and unequivocally after they disembark for their first island excursion, the movie begins to take liberties with the original tale.  Speaking of tales...Eustace did NOT spar with Reepicheep; he swung the mouse around by the tail.  This sort of misguided subtraction by addition is why many fans of the original storyline could be displeased by this movie.  Nonetheless, it's still a fantasy-adventure tale in which the characters grow and learn from their tribulations.Acting-wise, everything was professionally done.  Actors and voice actors alike were entertaining (Simon Pegg was particularly good as the voice of heroic Reepicheep), but Will Poulter absolutely stole the show as the obnoxious cousin.  I'm not sure I've ever wanted to punch an animated character before.  Maybe Scrappy Doo.  Anyway, Poulter is either as pompous and irritating as Eustace in real life, or idiot savant, Rainman brilliant.CGI is naturally prominent in a movie about talking animals, dragons, and magic.  None blew me away like in Avatar or Tron, but considering the target audience the realism presented was, in my opinion, nearly perfect.  Scary, but not quite nightmare-worthy.  The characters that were supposed to be terrifying (i.e. sea serpent) were shrouded in shadows and those who had redeeming qualities were shown in triumph and sunlight, and ways that capture the audience's attention.Considering its engaging story and alignment with Christian allegories, this is a very good movie, an easy recommendation for families, and a worthy addition to the Chronicles of Narnia canon, despite not completely faithful to the book.For thoroughness, a few of the differences...MAJOR DIFFERENCESThe addition of the green mist and the sword collection was neither necessary nor a substantive improvement.  The extra subplot about a father, and his stowaway child, who joins to save a wife captured by the mist was completely pointless and distractive.MINOR DIFFERENCES-Edmund had no big problem with his king-kid-king timeline-No mention of the Dufflepuds giant foot looking like a mushroom.-The sea serpent didn't die; it got tricked-Eustace attempts steals water, not an orange-Where is the old dragon that croaks near the water?-The end mentions nothing about light and water-The end mentions nothing about a marriage-There was no prisoner/slave saving; it was a purchase-Multiple island substories are intertwined and/or out of order-Lord Bern got married and settled down on Felimath; he didn't get imprisoned",4,A Tale With a Different Tail,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,3431,"['Right', 'top', ""'re"", 'looking', 'literal', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptation', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Aslan', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'tiger', 'are', 'countless', 'modifications', 'did', 'not', 'completely', 'align', 'book', 'numerous', 'subtleties', 'noticeable', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'story.For', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'TVOTDT', 'stayed', 'true', 'form', 'following', 'Lucy', 'Georgie', 'Henley', 'Edmund', 'Skandar', 'Keynes', 'easy', 'hate', 'cousin', 'Eustace', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'fabric', 'family', 'painting', 'vast', 'tapestry', 'Narnian', 'world', 'created', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'ship', 'painting', 'ship', 'join', 'forces', 'recently', 'crowned', 'year', 'Earthly', 'time', 'three', 'Narnia', 'King', 'Caspian', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'who', 'crew', 'sentient', 'beasts', 'willing', 'sailors', 'out', 'seven', 'Telmarine', 'lords', 'swords', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'board', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'unequivocally', 'disembark', 'first', 'island', 'excursion', 'movie', 'take', 'liberties', 'original', 'tale', 'Speaking', 'tales', 'Eustace', 'did', 'NOT', 'spar', 'Reepicheep', 'swung', 'mouse', 'tail', 'sort', 'misguided', 'subtraction', 'addition', 'why', 'many', 'fans', 'original', 'storyline', 'could', 'be', 'displeased', 'movie', 'Nonetheless', 'still', 'fantasy-adventure', 'tale', 'characters', 'grow', 'learn', 'tribulations.Acting-wise', 'everything', 'was', 'professionally', 'done', 'Actors', 'voice', 'actors', 'alike', 'were', 'entertaining', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'was', 'particularly', 'good', 'voice', 'heroic', 'Reepicheep', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'absolutely', 'stole', 'show', 'obnoxious', 'cousin', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wanted', 'punch', 'animated', 'character', 'Maybe', 'Scrappy', 'Doo', 'Anyway', 'Poulter', 'pompous', 'irritating', 'Eustace', 'real', 'life', 'idiot', 'savant', 'Rainman', 'brilliant.CGI', 'naturally', 'prominent', 'movie', 'talking', 'animals', 'dragons', 'magic', 'None', 'blew', 'away', 'Avatar', 'Tron', 'considering', 'target', 'audience', 'realism', 'presented', 'was', 'opinion', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'Scary', 'not', 'quite', 'nightmare-worthy', 'characters', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'terrifying', 'i.e', 'sea', 'serpent', 'were', 'shrouded', 'shadows', 'who', 'had', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'were', 'shown', 'triumph', 'sunlight', 'ways', 'capture', 'audience', 'attention.Considering', 'engaging', 'story', 'alignment', 'Christian', 'allegories', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'easy', 'recommendation', 'families', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'canon', 'not', 'completely', 'faithful', 'book.For', 'thoroughness', 'few', 'differences', 'MAJOR', 'DIFFERENCESThe', 'addition', 'green', 'mist', 'sword', 'collection', 'was', 'necessary', 'substantive', 'improvement', 'extra', 'subplot', 'father', 'stowaway', 'child', 'who', 'save', 'wife', 'captured', 'mist', 'was', 'completely', 'pointless', 'distractive.MINOR', 'DIFFERENCES-Edmund', 'had', 'big', 'problem', 'king-kid-king', 'timeline-No', 'mention', 'Dufflepuds', 'giant', 'foot', 'looking', 'mushroom.-The', 'sea', 'serpent', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'got', 'tricked-Eustace', 'attempts', 'steals', 'water', 'not', 'orange-Where', 'old', 'dragon', 'water', '-The', 'end', 'mentions', 'nothing', 'light', 'water-The', 'end', 'mentions', 'nothing', 'marriage-There', 'was', 'prisoner/slave', 'saving', 'was', 'purchase-Multiple', 'island', 'substories', 'are', 'intertwined', 'order-Lord', 'Bern', 'got', 'married', 'settled', 'down', 'Felimath', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'imprisoned']",N/A

194972,A28HO8AE8GPUIY,1616842490,J. B. Pritchard,"[11, 17]","Pros:  Great special effects, solid acting, some good character development.Cons:  The pacing is off, the plot is transformed for the worst, there is a complete lack of subtlety or depth and the movie lacks appropriate tone and purpose.Just so you know what how I'm approaching this movie, I will tell you upfront that I've loved the Narnia books since childhood and continue to be a Narnia geek into adulthood.  I thought that the first movie was great, the second movie was good and the third movie ... well, we'll get to that in a moment.In ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" Edmund and Lucy are back in Narnia along with their obnoxious cousin Eustace.  Why are they in Narnia?  According to the movie, it has something to do with laying some swords on a table and destroying the arch-villain of piece, a cloud of evil green mist.  At any rate, they sail from island to island with Caspian and his crew in something that vaguely approximates the adventures that these characters had in C.S. Lewis' book.This movie certainly had its good points.  The special effects were gorgeous to behold, the best of any of the Narnia movies yet.  The dragon looked amazing.  The acting performances were also solid (even Ben Barnes!) for the most part.  However, for whatever reason, this movie's creators decided to deal with the somewhat meandering storyline of ""Dawn Treader"" by throwing in a bunch of plot coupons that made the story even slower and harder to latch onto.  What is the goal of our heroes?  Well, it might be to find the seven lords and find Aslan's country as it was in the books.  Or it might be to find seven super-special swords and place them at Aslan's table.  Or it might be to find island X so that we can find island Y so that we can stop the people-eating mist.  I honestly started to feel like I was playing a video game - ""find X so you can take it to Y and place it on Z so the story can progress and you can stop evil.""  Or something.  The pacing was also very rushed.  The movie felt very short and the barest possible treatment is given to several pivotal scenes such as when the Lone Islands are freed from slavery.  ""Dawn Treader"" isn't a long book and I really felt like more could have been done with many of these episodes.The result is a movie that has its moments, but that fails as an overall experience.  There were certainly scenes in this movie that I loved.  Many of them involved Reepicheep, but our human heroes have their chance to shine as well.  I particularly enjoyed how the dynamic between Edmund and Caspian was explored.  Will Poulter as Eustace was also quite brilliant - he completely captured the obnoxiousness of that character. Too bad the writers and director don't give these talented actors something worth saying a little more often.  Part of the problem with this movie is that it has all the subtlety of a two-by-four to the face.  For example, in the books we get to see Edmund's lingering guilt about the White Witch incident through his occasional comments and his interaction with Eustace.  In this movie, however, we get a green-mist White Witch who follows Edmund around through half the film, making tempting comments.  Not very subtle.One gets the sense of the writers and director believe that their core audience is made up of idiots.  A shallow reading of Lewis' Narnia series would give one the impression that it is about a bunch of bratty kids wandering around Fantasyland while they learn somewhat childish moral lessons like ""don't fight with your sister"" and ""don't take candy from strangers.""  On one level, this certainly is what the Narnia series is about, but what gives the books their enduring power and what makes them appealing not just to children but to adults is a grandness, beauty and sense of purpose that the previous films capture to varying degrees, but which this latest installment fails to convey. Lewis' ""Dawn Treader"" is about the search for something greater than ourselves and it is about striking out on that search without much idea of where we are going.  In Caspian's case, it is about coming heartbreakingly close to finding that something and having to turn back because ""real life"" gets in the way.  When the creators chose to make the story about laying some swords on a table instead of grander purpose of sailing to the end of the world and finding Aslan's country, they deprived the series of the very elements that makes it so vital and enduring.  Nor did they manage replace these elements with a plot that is worth much in its own right.The creators of this movie seem to have aimed for mediocrity ... and barely managed to hit it. This is half trite children's movie, half wannabe action blockbuster, but the redeeming acting performances, decent character development, and pretty special effects may make it worth seeing for Narnia fans.  3- stars.",3,Aims for mediocrity ... and barely hits it.,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,4862,"['Pros', 'Great', 'special', 'effects', 'solid', 'acting', 'good', 'character',

194975,A2N2S9PPHMW016,1616842490,JDavid,"[14, 15]","As someone who was extremely disappointed by the Walden Media Disney version of ""Prince Caspian"", I almost skipped seeing ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.""  C.S. Lewis is not only one of my favorite writers, but has also been a spiritual guide, helping me to understand the nature of God and the spiritual reality that undergirds our present existence.  I found the film Prince Caspian to be a pretty sad mess--the original story was significantly revised, the characters were unlikeable, the moral tone was blunted and the spiritual depth was lost.But it is hard to keep me from any thing related to Narnia, so I did catch the Dawn Treader film before it ended its theater run.  I was pleasantly surprised.First, even though the film's plot is just as major a departure from the book as Caspian was, Dawn Treader manages to capture the spirit of Lewis's Narnia books.  The film story is a bit forced, with the villainous green mist representing the presence of evil and a new quest involving seven swords.  But even though this is somewhat silly, it does manage to convey the reality of evil and temptation, a major theme in Lewis' works.  The device of the reappearance of the White Witch to tempt Edmund is effective and convincing, as she not only poses a terrifying image of darkness, but she reminds us of Edmund's greatest moral failure, his betrayal of his own siblings.  Again, one might quibble with the film's plot device, but the director Michael Apted and his writers have remained true to Lewis in depicting a clearly spiritual struggle between good and evil.The film also succeeded for me in its characters.  Unlike in Caspian, the characters in Dawn Treader were presented in keeping with Lewis' own characterization.  These were once again likable, while fallible, portraits.  Caspian, Edmund, Lucy, the reformed Eustace and Reepicheep (a real highlight by the way) were heroic figures, striving toward virtue and the fulfillment of Aslan's purposes while they battled with inner and outer demons.  Caspian and Edmund, for example, experience tension and conflict with each other in several scenes yet genuinely like one other and are finally completely reconciled.  In the miserable Caspian film, by contrast, Caspian and Peter can scarcely abide each other's presence.Newcomer Will Poulter does an excellent job portraying the prig Eustace.  The course of his reformation is true to the book and a hopeful view of spiritual conversion and change.  This was another key strength in the film.Finally, the end of the film was a beautiful statement of Lewis' message in the original Dawn Treader.  As the main characters took leave of one another and Aslan at the edge of Aslan's country, Lewis's central themes of the hope of eternity and the longing for a heavenly home were powerfully displayed.  As I watched Lucy ask Aslan tearfully if she would ever see him again, with Aslan responding that she would know him by another name in her own world, I was truly moved.""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is not a perfect film or a cinematic masterpiece in every sense of that term.  But it, beyond my reasonable expectations, succeeds in several important ways.  It captures the spiritual vision of C.S. Lewis in conveying his reasoned belief in the existence of an almighty and loving God who is guiding his creation towards a good end.

There's action, adventure, and a few humorous quips here and there to keep you entertained throughout the film. It was, however, slightly confusing the way they explained (or didn't explain, I guess it just exists) the big bad Evil they were fighting and the bit about the Lords.

It is an adventure story and is also a novel that asks deep questions about the meaning of life.This movie version is a great show, even though it does differ from the book at a few points.  There is a green mist, an evil force, which is in the movie, but not in the book.  However, to me, the mist represented temptation and the way evil can work to distort and corrupt.  So in that way, it did fit as a visual style of a written concept.  Also the 7 swords concept was not in the book either, but again I think this was used to help transfer a written story to a visual and auditory experience.Great acting, beautiful cinematography, pretty music, impressive special effects, and a well told story make this a fun movie.

While staying somewhat truer to the novel than the horrendous ""Prince Caspian,"" Voyage of the Dawn Treader continues to suffer from the filmmaker's insistance on injecting 21st century teenage angst into this piece. Edmund nursing an inferiority complex to Caspian and stooping to Eustace's level are inconsistant with his character, as is Lucy's envy of Susan. Caspian is portrayed as a fop. The scene where the film jumps from Narnia to 1940's Chicago is jarring and unnecessary.Worse still, instead of being satisfied with an exploration adventure to discover the fate of 7 lost lords, the film injects a video-game like villian (green fog, no less), and a quest for seven lost swords. C.S. Lewis was teaching a voyage of self discovery, not trivial quests for trinkets to vanquish a vague unspecified evil. The film stumbles over this with contrary consecutive scenes where Caspian and Edmund speak against hoarding treasure, and then immediately continue on their sword quest. And if the Chronicles of Narnia are a Christian fable, would Jesus really wait until a collection swords were retrieved before swooping down and vanguishing the enemy?The series consistantly underestimates its audience.

194992,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,1616842490,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[299, 326]","If there's anything that Walden Media's CHRONICLES OF NARNIA movie franchise (based on C.S. Lewis' timeless novels) is known for lately, it could very well be that it ever continued at all.  The first film, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, was a box office smash, but successor PRINCE CASPIAN didn't achieve the same success.  But when Disney, who distributed and funded both films, decided not to participate in anymore NARNIA adventures, it seemed as though Lewis' tales were destined to remain forever frosted by the White Witch.  But thankfully, Walden Media refused to let NARNIA die so easily, and so they've teamed up with 20th Century Fox to complete the third movie in the series, THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER.  It could also very well be the last entry; critics have been lukewarm to negative on this film, and faced with so much competition this year from family films such as TRON LEGACY, HARRY POTTER, and even upcoming duds like YOGI BEAR and GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, this film could very well have a hard time finding its audience.  Whether the franchise continues or not is ultimately irrelevant, however, because what ultimately counts is that THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER is a wonderful way to spend another two hours in the world that Lewis conjured up so many years ago.I knew it would happen.  From the moment the opening titles came across the screen, I could feel the nostalgic magic so prevaliant in the first NARNIA movie seeping in, and it stayed that way for me the whole time.  The major difference, of course, is the set-up of the story.  Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund Pevensie (Skander Keyes), both approaching adulthood, are staying with their snarky, obnoxious cousin, Eustace (Will Poulter) when they notice a beautiful painting of a fantastical ship sailing on the ocean waters.  And of course, the picture comes to life, resulting with the squabbling children washed on the deck of the ship in question, the Dawn Treader, where their old friend, Caspian (Ben Barnes), now a bonafide king, welcomes them. It turns out that Caspian is searching for the seven lords that were banished from Narnia during the reign of his evil uncle.  Acompanied by the swashbuckling mouse warrior, Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg), the youngsters travel to various islands across the oceans in search of them.  And will Aslan (voiced, once more, by Liam Neeson) be there to help them?  You betcha.In addition to being a seagoing adventure (inevitable since most of the action takes place on the titular vessel), this tale also deals with spiritual matters.  Rather than matching wits against an evil menace as with the last two films (although the White Witch does make some brief cameo appearances), the major conflict deals with Lucy, Edmund, Caspian, and especially Eustace, all dealing with their own inner demons.  Each island adventure places the quartet through a series of psychological trials that they must overcome.  The lands they visit are a strange, yet fascinating lot.  There's the Lost Islands, operated by greedy slavemasters who make fortunes out of auctioning kidnapped people to baddies.  Another is seemingly deserted, trippy-looking place that looks as though it could come from ALICE IN WONDERLAND inhabited by invisible creatures as well as a magician (whose book can conjure up all kinds of spells, including one that grants pure beauty).  Still others include a cave with a pond that turns everything into gold, a dragon's treasure horde, an abandoned temple that turns out to be under a spell, and, ultimately, a thick fog of darkness in which one's worst fears comes alive.  It is within these places that each character undergoes some growth.  One of my particular favorite scenes involves Lucy wishing she could be as beautiful as her older sister Susan (Anna Popplewell, in a brief cameo), until Aslan admonishes her for stealing the spell from the magician's book.  This is very powerfully depicted through dramatic lighting and emotionally charged acting.  At one point, Edmund and Caspian both become jealous of each other when they are tempted by greed, but it's ultimately Eustace who shows the most growth in the picture.In the beginning of the film, Eustace is just about what you would expect from Lewis' text--he's snobbish, selfish, and condescending, delighting in bullying others while declaring himself superior.  He hates his cousins and quickly makes an enemy out of Reepicheep, who, at one point, chastises him for grabbing his most precious attribute:  ""No one touches the tail!""  And just when you've had enough of him, he is transformed into a fire-breathing dragon midway through the film.  This is where Eustace's character development really begins, as Reepicheep takes him under his, well, paws, and inspires him to do the right thing.  This abovementioned dynamic is the heart of the entire picture, and most of the credit goes to Will Poulter and Simon Pegg for their chemistry.  Poulter does a bang-up job of making Eustace bratty and unlikeable, and his maturation is a joy to behold.  This guy seriously needs an award for his performance.  Pegg, although vocally different from predecessor Eddie Izzard, is a delight as the mouse warrior; his voice is a cross between John Cleese and Cary Elwes, which captures his attitude to a T and beyond.  He has the best lines in the picture and obviously has fun with his role--although the real success to the character is the very convincing computer-animated effects that bring the mouse to life.That's one of the many memorable aspects of VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, which isn't to say that it is without its faults.  The film is directed by Michael Apted (the previous ones by Andrew Adamson), and he moves the tale along at a rapid pace, making it the breeziest (and shortest) of the NARNIA films.  However, I do have some qualms about both his direction and the adaptation; one of them is the scene where Eustace shows himself as a dragon for the first time.  Rather than having him see his reflection in the water, Apted decides instead to show Eustace's charred clothes, and then have his dragon form fly out of nowhere.  This disappointed me somewhat, as I felt that Lewis' original description of this moment was more powerful.  Furthermore, the encounter with Lilandi (Laura Brent), Caspian's future queen, is dealt with rather quickly.  An extra five minutes to show Caspian's affection for the girl wouldn't have hurt.  Finally, although the film is faithful to the novel for the most part, there is at least one addition that felt very pointless--a girl named Gael (Arabella Morton) who stows away with her father in search of her missing parents.  The new character doesn't have a particularly compelling personality and feels so irrelevant that one wonders why the screenwriters included her at all.But those are, truthfully, the only quibbles I have with THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER.  Other controversial changes are nowhere nearly as bothersome.  At first I wasn't so sure about the newly invented subplots concerning the search for the missing swords of the seven lords or a menacing green mist that appears every time a character is tempted, but in the end, I ultimately approved them wholeheartedly.  This especially works in favor of the climactic fight against one of the ugliest sea serpents ever committed to film (particularly when it literally tears apart into the likeness of a centipede), which is occasionally interspersed with ghostly images of Tilda Swinton's White Witch tempting Edmund to join her.  Although longer than in the book, this sequence is nonetheless very thrilling and arguably a more epic scene than in the original.  (It should be known, though, that this scene may be too scary for the young.)Every other aspect of the picture is exactly what one would ask for from a NARNIA adventure.  The cinematography and visual effects are both breathtaking and gorgeous to look at (there were a couple of places where some CG was obvious, but not enough to detract--the film was made on a smaller budget than predecessor CASPIAN), and David Arnold's score is amazingly epic, occasionally using some of original composer Harry Gregson-Williams' original tunes at various points in the movie.  Finally, the performances are top-notch.  Henley's Lucy has always been the most appealing attribute about the whole story, and she is no different here.  Every minute she is on screen is a pure delight, and her expressions and emotions are perfectly conveyed.  Keyes, who had a much smaller part in the previous movie, gets to do a lot more in this third chapter; granted there are some moments where one feels that his character briefly reverts to his old self, but Keyes handles that very effectively.  Barnes mysteriously loses the Spanish accent he was criticized for in the last film, yet it is hardly noticeable, as his performance is much more confident this time around.  The chemistry between all three is fantastic and, after Eustace and Reepicheep, provide the film with a warm, emotional ebb that works effectively in the final parting scenes at the end of the film.Overall, THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, although not quite as magical as the first movie, is still a very entertaining, joyous escapist fantasy which provides a lot of fun for every second of its 115 minute running time.  There are some differences from the book that purists may quibble with, and a couple of scenes that could stand to be either better or at least more fleshed out, but nonetheless it is a pleasure to join the Pevensies on one final adventure in the world of talking animals, monsters, prophecies and enchantment.  Whether the series continues or not, this is a fitting end and a delight from start to finish.  Now if only the film could be about 30 minutes longer....",4,"Another seagoing epic in Lewis' magical ""chronicles""!",1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,9828,"['anything', 'Walden', 'Media', 'CHRONICLES',

Second, I am not one of those folks that hates movies just because they don't slavishly follow the book.  I was reasonably happy with both the HP and LOTR movies as movies.  I was OK with Prince Caspian and even Eragon, but this?  Not only was this movie barely recognizable from the book, the changes made no sense and were often inconsistent with the overall story.  Seven magic swords?  What had been the quest for seven friends of Caspian's father became a quest for seven swords of indeterminate origin and powers, and the men they went to find were totally irrelevant.  The didn't even NOTICE the sleepers at Aslan's table!  And when they found Octesian in the water as a gold statue, not even a brief second of compassion, just ""Oooh, get the sword.""  And the swords makes no sense.  Let us presume that I am a usurper and I want to exile seven lords who oppose me, do I gift them each with a powerful magic sword (completely ignoring that there was never a single magic sword in any of the Chronicles) as parting gifts?  Maybe give them a nice hug too?Acting: Georgie Henley was head and shoulders above all the others and the only the thing that kept the movie from being an utter disaster.  Skandar was not too bad, but his part was poorly written.  Ben Barnes?  I still can't tell if he dropped the ball or just wasn't given anything to work with but his performance was completely non-memorable, it has only been a couple days and I can barely remember that he was in the movie, and I generally like him as an actor.  Will Poulter as Eustace... I am conflicted.  Not sure if I didn't like his portrayal or just didn't like the character he portrayed.  I would need to watch it again to be sure and not sure I want to watch it again.Scenery/cinematography:  Clearly the strength of the movie (though I was disappointed with Ramandu's Island).  Bright colors, sweeping vistas, the ship itself was clearly presented in a manner to appeal to children, and while this bothered me personally it was absolutely understandable to do in this type of movie.Bottom line:  even if I was able to completely forget I had ever read the book, it would still only get three stars, as it is, two is generous.I hope if they do The Silver Chair they can do a lot better.  I would even be OK with them bringing back the White Witch instead of the Green (because apparently it is impossible to make a Narnia movie without Tilda Swinton...) as long as they can maintain a logically consistent plot line and combine it with good acting.

This time I didn't leave the theater scratching my head because finally it all made sense.In the world of movie making the job of a director and screenplay writer is to tell a story in a visual format. Screenplay writers Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and Michael Petroni and director Michael Apted had a daunting task set before them. Their tale of the Dawn Treader's voyage is a stark contrast to the C.S. Lewis classic. Which in and of itself can be a good thing. In the original works by Lewis there are parts which don't flow together and you begin scratching your head trying to figure out what is going on and where the storyline is going. The screenplay writers bridged the gaps within the storyline. Their onscreen tale gives the story continuity so it flows smoothly on the ultra screen: The beginning where the children are taken into Narnia via a painting in Lucy's room in the Scrubb home. Landing on the Lone Islands with the capture and escape of the children from the slave traders. The evil green mist which has invaded Narnia and seeks to destroy all goodness within the land. Lucy's capture by the Dufflepuds. The Dawn Treader's crew meeting with Coriakin where they learn they must conquer the fears within themselves, so they can conquer the evil which has invaded Narnia. Eustace Scrubb's transformation from a boy into a dragon. The Dawn Treader crew journeying to Dark Island, where they encounter the White Witch for a final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Eustace's restoration from a dragon to a boy by Aslan. The laying of the seven swords at Aslan's Table. Caspian's choice to accept responsibility and the kindgom his father died for. Reepicheep's journey into Aslan's Country. Aslan's final scene with Lucy and Edmund before they leave Narnia for the final time. The children's exit from Narnia back into Lucy's room at the Scrubb home. How the tale is told at the beginning from the perspective of Lucy and then at the end is finished from Eustace's perspective.The purpose of actors in a movie is to engage the viewer in the storyline with their performance.The acting performance by Georgie Henley recaptured the awe and wonder of her performance in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" Sadly this is Georgie's last performance as Lucy until her character reappears again in ""The Horse and His Boy."" Will Poulter( Eustace), Skandar Keyes (Edmund), Tilda Swinton (The White Witch), Ben Barnes (Caspian) and Simon Pegg (Reepicheep) gave outstanding performances in their respective roles.Special effects are included in a movie to assist/aid in the story telling of the screenplay writers and director.A considerable amount of thought/effortenergy of making ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" was spent on the focus of special effects. The end result was a ""visual feast"" set before the viewers which I highly commend.The spiritual journey of the Christian faith and triumphing over evil is the major theme of ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader."" The storylines of Lucy struggling with vanity, Edmund facing the temptation of the White Witch, Eustace coming to grips with his greed/arrogance, Caspian accepting responsibility and Reepicheep's hope to see Aslan's country were exceptional. Each character faces a test, which as a result of keeping their eyes on Aslan and fighting the good fight, they emerge victorious.If there is one thing I could change, it would be to see Andrew Adamson return to the helm as director and screen play writer of the Narnia movies. He is a master storyteller and his presence was greatly missed in the adventure of ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.""",5,Return to the Magic...Return to Narnia,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,4072,"['December', '10', 'was', 'date', 'had', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'was', 'world', 'wide', 'release', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'movie', 'based', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'classic', 'Chronicles', 'Narina', 'series', 'watching', 'movie', 'left', 'theater', 'thinking', 'same', 'thing', 'did', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'time', 'What', 'just', 'happened', 'What', 're-reading', 'book', 'went', 'back', 'see', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'theater', 'scratching', 'head', 'finally', 'made', 'world', 'movie', 'making', 'job', 'director', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'tell', 'story', 'visual', 'format', 'Screenplay', 'Christopher', 'Markus', 'Stephen', 'McFeely', 'Michael', 'Petroni', 'director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'had', 'daunting', 'task', 'set', 'tale', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'voyage', 'stark', 'contrast', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'classic', 'Which', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'original', 'works', 'Lewis', 'are', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'together', 'begin', 'scratching', 'head', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'where', 'storyline', 'going', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'bridged', 'gaps', 'storyline', 'onscreen', 'tale', 'story', 'continuity', 'smoothly', 'ultra', 'screen', 'beginning', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'taken', 'Narnia', 'painting', 'Lucy', 'room', 'Scrubb', 'home', 'Landing', 'Lone', 'capture', 'escape', 'children', 'slave', 'traders', 'evil', 'green', 'mist', 'invaded', 'Narnia', 'destroy', 'goodness', 'land', 'Lucy', 'capture', 'Dufflepuds', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'crew', 'meeting', 'Coriakin', 'where', 'learn', 'must', 'conquer', 'fears', 'can', 'conquer', 'evil', 'invaded', 'Narnia', 'Eustace', 'Scrubb', 'transformation', 'boy', 'dragon', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'crew', 'journeying', 'Dark', 'Island', 'where', 'encounter', 'White', 'Witch', 'final', 'confrontation', 'forces', 'good', 'evil', 'Eustace', 'restoration', 'dragon', 'boy', 'Aslan', 'laying', 'seven', 'swords', 'Aslan', 'Table', 'Caspian', 'choice', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'kindgom', 'father', 'died', 'Reepicheep', 'journey', 'Aslan', 'Country', 'Aslan', 'final', 'scene', 'Lucy', 'Edmund', 'leave', 'Narnia', 'final', 'time', 'children', 'exit', 'Narnia', 'back', 'Lucy', 'room', 'Scrubb', 'home', 'How', 'tale', 'told', 'beginning', 'perspective', 'Lucy', 'then', 'end', 'finished', 'Eustace', 'perspective.The', 'purpose', 'actors', 'movie', 'engage', 'viewer', 'storyline', 'performance.The', 'acting', 'performance', 'Georgie', 'Henley', 'recaptured', 'awe', 'wonder', 'performance', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Sadly', 'Georgie', 'last', 'performance', 'Lucy', 'character', 'reappears', 'again', 'Horse', 'Boy', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'Eustace', 'Skandar', 'Keyes', 'Edmund', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'White', 'Witch', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'Caspian', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Reepicheep', 'gave', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'respective', 'roles.Special', 'effects', 'are', 'included', 'movie', 'assist/aid', 'story', 'telling', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'director.A', 'considerable', 'amount', 'thought/effortenergy', 'making', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'was', 'spent', 'focus', 'special', 'effects', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'visual', 'feast', 'set', 'viewers', 'highly', 'commend.The', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'Christian', 'faith', 'triumphing', 'evil', 'major', 'theme', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'storylines', 'Lucy', 'struggling', 'vanity', 'Edmund', 'facing', 'temptation', 'White', 'Witch', 'Eustace', 'coming', 'grips', 'greed/arrogance', 'Caspian', 'accepting', 'responsibility', 'Reepicheep', 'hope', 'see', 'Aslan', 'country', 'were', 'exceptional', 'character', 'test', 'result', 'keeping', 'eyes', 'Aslan', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'emerge', 'one', 'thing', 'could', 'change', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'Andrew', 'Adamson', 'return', 'helm', 'director', 'screen', 'play', 'writer', 'Narnia', 'movies', 'master', 'storyteller', 'presence', 'was', 'greatly', 'missed', 'adventure', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader']",N/A

195003,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,1616842490,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[4, 5]","This Chronicles of Narnia film is different from prior adaptations: set on a ship, it's more claustrophobic, and with sequential landfalls, it's more episodic and disjointed.  Admittedly, it's more streamlined than the novel, but be aware that this is not a retread of the prior films.  Since it aims for an older, more sophisticated audience, it takes on more complex, ambiguous themes, though it retains the prior films' profound vision.Part of the difference may lie with a new director: Michael Apted, famed for films like Gorky Park and The World is Not Enough, returns from semi-retirement to make a film reflecting his background.  This film teems with lush locations, swashbuckling action, and colorful characters.  The original book differs enough from its predecessors to justify these changes, but casual viewers can tell this film comes from a new, energetic director.Yet with Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes reprising their roles as Lucy and Edmund Pevensie, and Ben Barnes back as Caspian, I felt no discontinuity between this film and the prior.  The stars have grown up with us watching, and I wager all of them have thriving careers ahead of them.  Will Poulter makes an excellent Eustace Scrubb: both officious and self-righteous before discovering Narnia, and humble and eager afterward.I wish Apted made more ambitious use of Lewis' non-human characters.  Only swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep and a shaggy minotaur get significant face-time.  Some shipboard scenes perilously resemble a Pirates of the Caribbean remake.  But apart from that one grumble, I found this film a worthy successor to the two prior, making good use of the characters and inventive use of Narnia's locations.

Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 48% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on a sample of 139 reviews, with a rating average of 5.7 out of 10. Among Rotten Tomatoes' Top Critics, which consists of popular and notable critics from the top newspapers, websites, television and radio programs, the film holds an overall approval rating of 50%, based on a sample of 26 reviews. The consensus was: ""Its leisurely, businesslike pace won't win the franchise many new fans, but Voyage of the Dawn Treader restores some of the Narnia franchise's lost luster with strong performances and impressive special effects."" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating from film critics, the film has a rating score of 53% based on 33 reviews. CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinemagoers gave the film an A- on an A+ to F scale.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film and gave it three stars out of four, saying ""This is a rip-snorting adventure fantasy for families, especially the younger members who are not insistent on continuity."" Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave it a three stars out of four; he remarked it is ""a worthy challenger to the far more popular Harry Potter pictures"". The Guardian gave the film a positive review. They stated that the film ""arrives with confidence and bravado intact. ... and arguably the most Tolkien-esque of the Narnia books"". IGN was positive, stating ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a solid sequel that might even surpass the first entry as the best in the series for some fans. It also bodes well for the future of this once iffy franchise.""  Several film critics have praised Apted's direction in character development and Poulter's performance as Eustace. Among them, Arizona Republic's Kerry Lengel said, ""the best thing about the film is neither the top-notch CGI nor the shallow moral lessons but the performance of Georgie Henley as Lucy as well as the performance of her and Edmund's insufferable cousin Eustace Scrubb.""  Luke Y. Thompson from E! Online praised the performances, stating ""Henley and Keynes are charming as ever, and Poulter's turn as Eustace injects a welcome note of comedic cynicism into the sea of sentimentality.

Key for many was the closing scene with Lucy and Aslan in which Aslan assures a sobbing Lucy ""that he's very much in her world, where he has 'another name'. and that ""This was the very reason why (Lucy was) brought to Narnia, that by knowing (Aslan) here for a little, (she) may know (him) better there.""

However I wanted to note that I PURCHASED the Amazon Instant Video of this movie and when I wanted to watch it again, I received an error message that Amazon no longer has streaming rights to Voyage of the Dawn Treader!!!  It didn't matter that I had legally purchased this movie and it should have been mine fair and square.  IT WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR INSTANT STREAMING ANY MORE AND THEREFORE IT WAS NO LONGER MINE!!!!  With all the hoopla about Hollywood going to extreme lengths to stop video pirating, I find it shocking that this movie company is doing the exact same thing in reverse!  The movie was rightfully mine, but the STOLE it back from me with no notification, no offer of compensation, not so much as a ""how do you do""!. I call that video pirating.  When I called Amazon to ask what was going on, the Customer Service agent said that the movie company is issuing a new edition of the DVD and wanted to ""encourage everyone to buy the new DVD"".  I wonder if they broke into all the homes of people who had purchased ealier physical DVDs and took back that merchandise, too?  What a scam!  I was actually starting to build a virtual video library on Amazon.com and phase out my physical videos, but now I no longer trust that system.  In the end, I had to demand a refund from Amazon, and they gave it to me, but if I had never tried to watch this movie again, they would have kept my money forever and I wouldn't have even known the difference.  Shame on them.  BLECH!Original Review:THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER has always been my favorite of the Narnia books and this movie didn't dissappoint me (at least not much)! It is such a fun story, but more than that, the underlying themes hit so close to home that I couldn't help but love it. It is amazing that the primary lessons of this book still came through, even in the hands of a movie company whose bottom line is profit.The visual effects were beautiful, and even though it is a bit scary we took our stout hearted grandchildren (ages 4 and 6) to see it. We had already read them the book series, and they sort of knew going in what to expect, but to have it displayed in living color right before their very eyes was a lot for them to handle. There was some eye hiding, but with guidance, they coped very well and it didn't give them nightmares. I do advise any adults who are thinking about taking kids to see this movie to watch it alone first and determine if it suitable for your particular young ones. There are some scenes that could be extremely scary for a small child and ours did plenty of eye hiding at intense parts. They knew they were free to ask to leave, and they chose to stay the distance. There was no crying, and once we talked about it they wanted to see this movie again and handled it fine the second time around.My only regret was that the feature film time slot required that some great parts of the story had to be pared from the finished product. I really missed the sub-plot about how Prince Caspian finds a wife. I was disappointed in the whole Susan/Caspian romance that was inserted into the last movie and maybe that is why the real Caspian romance with the daughter of a star was dumbed down in this flick.

All of us thoroughly enjoyed it and we bought the DVD when it was released: we also enjoyed watching the film at home.I thought the first two ""Chronicles of Narnia"" films were excellent, but I had not expected this one to live up to the same standard. For one thing, the makers were attempting to fit into two hours a book which I would have expected to be particularly difficult to show in that form.In fact the film exceeded both my expectations and if anything I enjoyed it even more than the first two films,The Chronicles Of Narnia - The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe [DVD] [2005], andThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.The original C.S. Lewis bookThe Voyage of the ""Dawn Treader"" (Puffin Books)has one of the most memorable and amusing opening lines in children's fiction:""There was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it.""No film or TV version of this book will work without a good actor playing Eustace. He has to be someone we can love to hate in the early part of the film, come to sympathise with as the story continues, and whose expressions and actions show the shock, horror and incredulity of a boy who had been raised to scoff at fairy tales and legends who suddenly discovers that they are real and he has been transported into one.This character is brought amusingly to life in this film by Will Poulter, whose elastic face displays brilliantly the shock or confusion most of us would feel if we really found ourselves in a world of magic, dragons, and talking animals. Eustace is the cousin of the Pevensie children from the first two films. He has overheard his cousins Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henshaw) and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keyes) talking about a land called Narnia, and assumed that they were playing fantasy games. When the three of them are magically transported aboard the ship ""Dawn Treader"" he is a picture of stunned disbelief. Eustace's reaction when he asks where they are, to be told - by a minotaur, no less - that they are aboard ""the finest ship in the Narnian navy"" is almost worth watching the film for on its own.As mentioned, the screenwriters had a real challenge to fit the book into two hours, and to be both to be reasonably true to the spirit of the book while keeping the viewer in suspense. As with ""Prince Caspian, they somewhat altered the order of events, though it usually got back onto roughly the same track in the end. In fact almost all the major events of the book eventually happened in the film, along with most of my favourite details of the book, but not necessarily in the same order or quite the same way.A number of scenes in the book had to be radically cut down, although with the exception of the first adventure at the Lone Islands, this was done in a way which did relatively little damage to the storyline. As in the book, the Dawn Treader encounters slavers at the Lone Islands, one of them played in a cameo role by Douglas Gresham, stepson of C.S. Lewis, who was an executive producer on the film staff. But the coup d'etat which follows in the book, a brilliant and daring bluff by which King Caspian (Ben Barnes) overthrows Gumpas, the corrupt governor of the islands, did not make it into the film. This was about the only element of the book which I was disappointed not to see.The scriptwriters cut down on the number of occasions when the Dawn Treader drops anchor at yet another new island by putting more than one adventure on some islands which in the book took place at different ones, and by cutting out some of the uneventful stops in the book to take on food and water. They also cut out some of the action on both Coriakin's and Ramandu's islands - including, surprisingly, Ramandu himself, although Coriakin (Bille Brown in one of the strongest performances in the film) has a slightly enhanced role, while Ramandu's daughter Lilliandil (Laura Brent) and the Dufflepuds do appear. Many fans of the book will be disappointed not to see more of the Dufflepuds, and if you blink you'll miss the start of the romance between Caspian and Lilliandil.At the same time, certain other things have been extended. The duel to which Eustace is challenged by Reepicheep the talking mouse (Simon Pegg) actually takes place in this film, and was both very funny, and started the process of depicting Reepicheep as a much more complex character than he appeared in ""Prince Caspian."" The quest to find the seven missing Narnian lords is extended into a struggle to defeat an evil which is threatening to corrupt the whole world of Narnia, and several of the individual stories which make up the book slotted so well into the extended quest that you could almost imagine C.S. Lewis's meant to write it that way.The moral aspects and christian allegories of the book have been dialled down very slightly, but not enough to offend any but the most fanatical C.S. Lewis purist -  it would have wrecked the story if they had been largely or entirely removed, but too much moralising would have spoiled ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" as family entertainment. I think they got the balance about right.Ben Barnes does an excellent reprise of his role as Caspian (recognisably the same character but he's dropped the hispanic accent), with Skandar Keyes bringing real power to the role of Edmund and Georgie Henshaw absolutely magnificent as a teenage Lucy. So much so that it's a terrible shame they won't have an opportunity for another central role in any of the remaining films.However, if the series continues I've no doubt they will get some cameos, just as William Moseley and Anna Popplewell do in this one playing the elder Pevensie brother and sister, Peter and Susan (in scenes set in our world). And three of the Pevensie siblings - Edmund, Susan and Lucy - have important supporting parts in the book ""The Horse and His Boy (Puffin Books)"" so doubtless Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keyes and Georgie Henshaw will appear in that film.Apart from the lead characters, other excellent performances come from Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan and Simon Pegg, who takes over from Eddie Izzard as the voice of Reepicheep, leader of Narnia's talking mice. This is an extremely difficult role to bring off because he has to be funny in places but also genuinely heroic. (If you've not read the book, imagine a version of Antonio Banderas's character from Shrek II except that where the swordfighting ""Puss in Boots"" is 80% comic and 20% hero, Reepicheep the swordfighting mouse is 80% hero and 20% comic.)Eddie Izzard was immensely amusing as Reepicheep in ""Prince Caspian"" but Simon Pegg's performance was even better, as both the book and film really develop Reepicheep as a much more subtle and rounded character, particularly in the friendship he develops with Eustace despite the worst possible start. The screenwriters took huge liberties with the details of this relationship, but they were absolutely true to the spirit of this part of the book, and this worked for me partly because of Simon Pegg's and Will Poulter's acting (and the skill of the animators, of course).I also appreciated Gary Sweet's role as Drinian, captain of the Dawn Treader, and the shakespearean actor Bille Brown was very impressive as the magician Coriakin.Like the first two ""Chronicles of Narnia"" films, the beginning of this one spends slightly longer in wartime England before children are called into Narnia than in the book. This time it is Edmund who is struggling with some of the problems that all of them would have faced on their return to our world and which Peter in particular was finding difficult at the start of ""Prince Caspian."" If you can imagine spending a decade or two in another word in which you were a king, during which time you had grown to manhood, commanded armies, fought and won wars, and then suddenly had to go back to being an ordinary teenager who the British army considers too young to enlist - it would be pretty infuriating, wouldn't it?We're all used to fantastic special effects these days, but they were magnificent in this film. I gather much of it was filmed in the same facility used to create ""Titanic"" and ""Master and Commander."" From the Dawn Treader herself to mermaids, talking animals, a scary dragon and an even scarier sea serpent, all sorts of wonderful or magical things were made to look real.My other comment about this film is that it was far and away the funniest of the three - I laughed out loud at least half a dozen times while watching this one.One nice little touch was that the closing credits were accompanied by a selection of the Pauline Baynes cartoons which illustrated the original book.DVD extras included a digital copy which can be loaded onto a computer, four deleted scenes, director's commentary, and three music videos which interwove film of the artists who produced the background songs with scenes from the film.Conclusion: broadly true to the spirit of thebook, gripping and exciting, well worth watching. I really hope they are able to bring out films of the other four books, and if so, am really looking forward to whichever of ""The Silver Chair"" or ""The Horse and his boy"" they make next.",5,Brings

The diehard fans may not be happy with the liberties they took with the story, but for the rest of us, this is a fun, fantasy tale for the family.Lucy and Edmund are the two who return to Narnia in this film. Their older siblings are too old for this adventure. So instead, they bring their obnoxious cousin, Eustace.Caspian is also back and this time he's the king.With the children back in Narnia, they board Caspian's boat The Dawn Treader. They travel to a number of Narnia's islands and confront the ""evil green smoke"". With what you'd expect from Edmund, he is tired of playing second fiddle to his brother and Caspian. Caspian is trying to emerge from his father's shadow and Lucy wishes she could be as beautiful as her sister.The green smoke causes them to forget about what they have and fight amongst themselves.Eustace, on the other hand, does his job perfectly. Throughout the first half of the movie, you'll hate him so much that you will want to constantly reach into the screen and strangle the boy. (this is excellent on the part of the actor.)Voyage of the Dawn Treader may have a couple intense scenes with a sea serpent too scary for younger children.Aslan comes this close to proclaiming who he's ""supposed"" to be.And you have a high seas adventure.What more could you want?",4,One More Family Fun Narnia Trip,1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,1357,"['enjoyed', 'third', 'installment', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'diehard', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'liberties', 'took', 'story', 'rest', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'family.Lucy', 'Edmund', 'are', 'two', 'who', 'return', 'Narnia', 'film', 'older', 'siblings', 'are', 'too', 'old', 'adventure', 'So', 'instead', 'bring', 'obnoxious', 'cousin', 'Eustace.Caspian', 'also', 'back', 'time', 'king.With', 'children', 'back', 'Narnia', 'board', 'Caspian', 'boat', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'travel', 'number', 'Narnia', 'islands', 'confront', 'evil', 'green', 'smoke', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Edmund', 'tired', 'playing', 'second', 'fiddle', 'brother', 'Caspian', 'Caspian', 'trying', 'emerge', 'father', 'shadow', 'Lucy', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'beautiful', 'sister.The', 'green', 'smoke', 'forget', 'what', 'have', 'fight', 'amongst', 'themselves.Eustace', 'other', 'hand', 'job', 'perfectly', 'first', 'half', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'want', 'constantly', 'reach', 'screen', 'strangle', 'boy', 'excellent', 'part', 'actor', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'may', 'have', 'couple', 'intense', 'scenes', 'sea', 'serpent', 'too', 'scary', 'younger', 'children.Aslan', 'close', 'proclaiming', 'who', 'supposed', 'be.And', 'have', 'high', 'seas', 'more', 'could', 'want']",N/A

But, to me, the book this is based upon is such a great adventure story, and a classic favorite of my (and many other people's) youth, it seems a sin to make a movie adaptation and not try to stick with Lewis's original.  They got the main plot sequences in, but they rushed through them in order to add a completely unneccesary plot of their own: that Caspian and friends have to collect 7 swords and arrange them on a table to stop some magic mists that are threatening Narnia.  Now, for a series with a Christian subtext, it seems particularly stupid to have this meaningless mumbo-jumbo added when there are plenty of meaningful themes there that this will only detract from.So overall, an entertaining fantasy film, but a disappointment to those who like Narnia as C.S.

195031,A3D9KO6R1JB845,1616842490,"Michael Sloane,Tempe,Arizona,United States of...","[2, 2]","The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a wonderful adventure. While Prince Caspian was a big disappointment,this movie returns the wonder of Narnia found in The Lion,the,Witch,and the Wardrobe. Now,while The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is not NEARLY as literal a book to movie translation as the Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe was,the spirit of the story is absolutely preserved. The feeling of adventure our now seafaring friends provide in the book is absolutely present in the movie. The order in which they find each of the places is somewhat different in the movie than in the book but they are all there. The biggest change from the book to the movie is that the key plot point involving Eustace occurs much later in the film than it did in the book. The Voyage of The dawn Treader is an exceptionally well made movie that really captures the spirit of it' s story. The visual work and acting is the best of the 3 Narnia films. The change of order of events doesn't bother me at all. They hit all the important places and the plot and spirit of the story is captured well. I also really liked the character moment where Caspian decides to stay in Narnia rather than seek his father in Aslan's country.

I haven't jumped on the blueray bandwagon yet, but for movies I know I am going to care about: Harry Potter, Twilight, Narnia etc, I always order the 2 disc dvd editions cause I love the documentaries and stuff. Now, I don't know about the rest of you, but to me, a 2 disc edition means 2 discs in the same case. That's been true with every other set I've purchased. Not this one, however. The 2 disc edition comes in 2 separate cases, and to add insult to injury, they're the new, ultra-cheap cases that I've been seeing more and more of lately. I like the movies to all be in 1 case; space on my shelves is at a premium, and if I would have known this was what I was going to receive, I would have just bought the single disc edition and gone on with life. Since both discs have different covers, I can't just put them in a double case and go on with life. I'm very, very disappointed in this purchase, but hopefully actually watching the movie will make up for its terrible packaging, at least a little.

195043,A3T0OTH5072YRE,1616842490,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[3, 3]","First off, I have to say that the book version of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is my favorite book in the entire series.  So if you mess with it, it tends to upset me a bit.  I had been impressed with how well the first movie stayed in tune with the book that I was anxious for this one to come out, imagining all sorts of wonderful things for it.  So after watching it, I was disappointed a bit.  It was still a very nice movie (and probably more so for those who haven't read the books)  but to me it was lacking in areas.Lucy and Edmund Pevensie are staying with their annoying cousin Eustace Scrubb and his family while the rest of their relatives are in America.  While Eustace is berating them on something or other once again, they notice that a painting of a ship at sea on the wall starts moving.  Before they know it, they are pulled into the painting and land sputtering in their sea while the great ship pulls up to them.  It is none other than Prince Caspian (from previous adventures) and brings them aboard.  You see, this is the land of Narnia, where Lucy and Edmund once ruled with their other siblings as Queen and King.  They are happy to be there, but Eustace is decidedly not, especially since Reepicheep, the talking mouse, won't give him a moments break.  They join Caspian on his voyage to rescue seven missing lords and also discover where an evil green mist comes from.  Their journey will be perilous, but full of wonder as well.Characters:Georgie Henley-Lucy PevensieSkandar Keynes-Edmund PevensieWill Poulter-Eustace ScrubbBen Barnes-King CaspianSimon Pegg-ReepicheepLiam Neeson-Aslanand many othersI've always enjoyed the characters of Lucy and Edmund, and think they are played well in this film (and the others).  Although really, Lucy kind of takes a back seat in this one, which is a shame, because I really like her.  Poulter as Eustace did an excellent job.  I really wanted to drown him like everyone in the movie did he was so annoying.  Ben Barnes did an excellent job as Caspian as well.  Reepicheep the mouse was interesting, although he does get tiring at times.Its a shame that with as much dedication that was shown to the characters, they couldn't have done the same for the original plot as well.  Sure everything is remotely the same and there are some scenes straight out of the book, but they changed some things that should never have been changed, omitted others, and added new scenes that frankly weren't that great.  I would have much preferred to see the actual book happenings as I consider them much more exciting.  The antagonist of the Mist was way out there for me as well since this was a book that was more about adventure than strife and I think the movie could have pulled that notion off just fine.The visuals were pretty excellent in this movie along with the music.  While there were some things from the book I would have loved to have seen brought to life, it was still a very pretty film and I did enjoy the parts that were shown.  I think its wonderful how they generate the mythical creatures and talking animals in these films.  They give it a lot of detail.  Even the sunsets were well done in this movie.While I was very disappointed in all the changes from the book, I do recognize that those who haven't read it, but have watched the other movies, will probably enjoy this one.  For me though, it spoiled it a good bit and all the pretty visuals couldn't make me love the movie.  I merely thought it average because of these things.Review by M.

Like the other Chronicles of Narnia movies (The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch & the WardrobeandThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian), this movie was high-quality in production and quite consistent with the original source material (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (Narnia) Publisher: HarperCollins). The movie has all the hallmarks of a great fantasy movie: magical items, dragons, sea monsters, talking beasts, sword fights, magicians, and explorers venturing into unknown regions.Like the other Narnia movies, this movie has clear undertones of Biblical principles, the most prominent ones being warnings against selfishness, self-indulgence, and greed, and the inability of people to change their own condition without the transformative power of a savior.Some of the images in the movie could be pretty scary for young eyes, and I would not recommend this movie for kids younger than 8 years old, as such.

""Pamela""","[0, 0]","As many have stated, if you want a faithful adaptation of the book, you should check out the BBC version I watched (and memorized) as a child. That being said, there are many changes to the story that I appreciated. When Eustace is caught stealing from the water supply in the book, Caspians threatens the next one caught stealing with violence, while, in the movie, the scene is much lighter (with no threat of ancient barbaric naval discipline). The Dragon Eustace gets much more screen time and plays a larger role than his page-bound counterpart (not to mention the fact that being a Dragon is protrayed in a brighter light in the movie). In the book, Aslan rebukes Caspian for wanting to accompany the children to His Country, but in the movie, Aslan allows him the choice.There were also some changes I didn't like. I was looking forward to seeing the overthrow of governor Gumpas and the subsequent setting free of all the slaves, but they cut it out of the story. They cut out the chess scenes between Eustace and Reepicheep (which I was looking forward to seeing). The movie did feel a bit more rushed and shorter than the others, too.The largest thing I docked it a star for was the packaging on the Blu-Ray combo pack. While it *looks* good, the DVD and Blu-Ray disks are packaged in a cardboard sleeve (like free promo DVDs), and the DVD was unwatchable until I cleaned it because it had some residue on it (perhaps adhesive from the sleeve). It was also scratched. I now have to keep those two disks in a seperate DVD case from the packaging to keep them from getting damaged further. In short, it's just not a very durable and functional packaging, and someone should have realized this ahead of time.Overall, I enjoyed the new twist on a time-honored classic. I do hope they make the rest of them, however, I realize that's increasingly unlikely. After all, filmmakers only want to produce a movie if it's going to make a huge profit, something that's harder to do with the current economy, the state of home theatre technology, and the ridiculous price of a movie ticket (not to mention the sticky floor, junk food, uncomfortable seats, and noisy children). If, however, you only like movies that copy the book exactly, then perhaps the whole recent Narnia franchise isn't for you. None of them have stayed particularly faithful to the books, and if people expected such from Dawn Treader, they were no doubt dissappointed. On it's own, however, Dawn Treader comes across as a fun movie with a good moral and great CGI.Signed, Pamela",4,"Great Moive, Less-Than-Great Packaging",1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,2549,"['many', 'have', 'stated', 'want', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'BBC', 'version', 'watched', 'memorized', 'child', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'many', 'changes', 'story', 'appreciated', 'When', 'Eustace', 'caught', 'stealing', 'water', 'supply', 'book', 'Caspians', 'next', 'one', 'caught', 'stealing', 'violence', 'movie', 'scene', 'much', 'lighter', 'threat', 'ancient', 'barbaric', 'naval', 'discipline', 'Dragon', 'Eustace', 'much', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'larger', 'role', 'page-bound', 'counterpart', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'being', 'Dragon', 'protrayed', 'brighter', 'light', 'movie', 'book', 'Aslan', 'Caspian', 'wanting', 'accompany', 'children', 'Country', 'movie', 'Aslan', 'choice.There', 'were', 'also', 'changes', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'overthrow', 'governor', 'Gumpas', 'subsequent', 'setting', 'free', 'slaves', 'cut', 'story', 'cut', 'out', 'chess', 'scenes', 'Eustace', 'Reepicheep', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'did', 'feel', 'bit', 'more', 'rushed', 'shorter', 'others', 'too.The', 'largest', 'thing', 'docked', 'star', 'was', 'packaging', 'Blu-Ray', 'combo', 'pack', 'good', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'disks', 'are', 'packaged', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'free', 'promo', 'DVDs', 'DVD', 'was', 'unwatchable', 'cleaned', 'had', 'residue', 'perhaps', 'adhesive', 'sleeve', 'was', 'also', 'scratched', 'now', 'have', 'keep', 'two', 'disks', 'seperate', 'DVD', 'case', 'packaging', 'keep', 'getting', 'damaged', 'further', 'short', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'durable', 'functional', 'packaging', 'someone', 'should', 'have', 'realized', 'ahead', 'time.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'new', 'twist', 'time-honored', 'classic', 'do', 'hope', 'make', 'rest', 'however', 'realize', 'increasingly', 'unlikely', 'filmmakers', 'only', 'want', 'produce', 'movie', 'going', 'make', 'huge', 'profit', 'something', 'harder', 'do', 'current', 'economy', 'state', 'home', 'theatre', 'technology', 'ridiculous', 'price', 'movie', 'ticket', 'not', 'mention', 'sticky', 'floor', 'junk', 'food', 'uncomfortable', 'seats', 'noisy', 'children', 'however', 'only', 'movies', 'copy', 'book', 'exactly', 'then', 'perhaps', 'whole', 'recent', 'Narnia', 'franchise', ""n't"", 'None', 'have', 'stayed', 'particularly', 'faithful', 'books', 'people', 'expected', 'such', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'were', 'doubt', 'dissappointed', 'own', 'however', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'across', 'fun', 'movie', 'good', 'moral', 'great', 'CGI.Signed', 'Pamela']",N/A

I read the RottenTomatoes reviews which ranked it at 50% under the (somewhat boring) ""Prince Caspian"" which earned a ""certified fresh"" 67%, so I didn't have the highest of hopes.My expectations were blown away, however, at the captivating magic quality of the film. The mystery of the islands the characters explore brought me back to the feeling I had when I first saw ""Goonies"", which is one of my favorite films. The movie seems to successfully capture the wonder and mystery that ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" tries for, but I honestly think ""Dawn Treader"" is far more entertaining.The only reason I can fathom for people not liking this film is being made uncomfortable with the religious allegory, but even then, it doesn't feel unnatural or distracting to the story. Then again, I'm not sure why ""Prince Caspian"" in particular was better-received because ""Dawn Treader"" is easily my favorite film of the Narnia series!As for the Blu-ray itself. Quality is pretty top notch. The film was shot digitally so you get a very clean image that pops from the screen and the lossless sound is immersive and fun, making good use of surrounds to add a 3D feel. WWII fighter planes roar overhead, the sounds of the  ocean come through well and you feel like part of the scene when dragons and magical creatures jump around you.Oh, and while it looks like several people had trouble with the packaging, I had no problems and thought it was kind of fun. Instead of the standard, boring plastic case, you get a shiny embossed slipcover and a colorful cardboard case that has sleeves that flip out on either side to reveal art of the deck of the ship with dragon flying overhead. In the center is a ships wheel case that flips down to hold the digital copy disk. Behind the center section, you even get some postcards with scenes of the film. Very cool!

195078,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,1616842490,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Narnia:Voyage of the Dawn treader(Dec/10),is the third sequel in the series so far.Disney Studios helmed the first one but dropped the property and Fox picked it up.The first film under Fox's auspices Narnia:Prince Caspian was,I thought,a little on the long and plodding side.This film however moves at quite a brilliant pace and Fox seems to have found its' ""sea legs"" with the franchise.The plot this time around finds Lucy(Georgie Henley)and Edmund(Skandar Keynes)staying with their cousin Eustace and his parents in the war torn countryside of England.They are up in their room when Eustace(Will Poulter)enters and they all start into arguing.Lucy gets distracted as a painting of a heavy sea-tossed ship starts spewing water.It starts out small but eventually,to everyone's shock,it becomes a torrent.Before they know it the room is submerged and they are swimming for their lives.They all surface in the ocean(of the painting)and the ship pulls up and sailors from it jump into save them.One of the rescuers if prince Caspian himself.Safely on board there is a touching reunion with their old friend.No one knows quite why they are there but the prince is off looking for the seven lords of Telmar,friends of his late father and banished by Caspian's evil uncle.Eustace is totally in shock about everything and his ramblings and outbursts become a source of amusement for the crew.They first arrive at one of the Lone islands whose populace is under the heels of slave traders.What people the traders do not sell they sacrifice to a green mist in the bay.They also find one of the Lords they seek,imprisoned,who tells them one of the reasons he came was to investigate the green mist.They kill the slave trade leader and reclaim the island for Narnia and make the found Lord its ruler.In exchange,the lord gives Caspian one of the seven swords given to him by Caspian's late father.They sail to another Lone Island and camp overnight on a beach.Near morning Lucy is taken away by an invisible creature.They force her to enter a house to obtain a spell which will make all things unseen,seen again.This she does and meets a magician who tells her,and later the entire landing party,where they must go and they learn more about the mysterious green mist.Meanwhile Lucy has been discovered missing and the landing party is out searching.They come upon the invisible creatures who remain that way for only a short time,when Lucy speaks the incantation.They are revealed as amusing one footed creatures who were made invisible for their own protection by the magician in the house.The crews next stop is a volcanic island where they find an underground pool of ""water"" that turns everything that falls into it into gold.In it they discover one of the missing lords and they retrieve his sword.However Edmund's temptations get the best of him,re the pool and its powers,and he and Caspian start to fight.Lucy brings both back to their senses.Eustace has wandered off from the main party and he finds a gully strewn with golden trinkets.This is dragon treasure;very bewitched and enchanted.Edmund starts to collect various items and by the time the landing party finds him he has been turned into a dragon.They also find yet another missing Lord and his sword,which they collect.At first they weren't sure if the dragon was Eustace until he wrote that he was in the sand.The party sleeps overnight on the beach and Lucy awakes to find a shining blue star in the sky that was foretold to them.They follow the star and arrive at another of the Lone Islands to discover Aslans table with three lords in a somnolescent state.The blue star descends from the sky and appears as a beautiful woman.She reveals the source of the green mist;a dark and frightening island in the distance where the crew must travel if they are to defeat the great evil.They lay all the collected swords so far on Aslan's table and sail to the Dark Island to get the final sword and defeat the evil there.As they approach they discover the final sword in the hands of the last lord,half crazed and delirious from fear,sitting on a small rock outcropping.Once on board he warns that anything they think will come to pass.At that moment the thought Edmund had,comes to life,as a giant sea serpent.The crew endures a terrible and drawn out battle with the serpent.Eustace,as the dragon,battles the serpent bravely but on a pass of the ship the old Lord,mistaking Eustace for a real dragon,impales him with his sword.Eustace flies off landing on a bright sandy beach where he meets Aslan himself.Aslan changes Eustace back to a boy,heals him and returns him to his table where he must place the final sword.The crew meanwhile is in a pitched battle with the  serpent and when Eustace finally is able to place the sword onto the table the force carries over to Edmund's sword who stabs the serpent fatally in the upper part of its mouth,killing it and ending the evil spell over Narnia.The ship makes its final stop at the end of the world and Aslan's beach.It's a joyous reunion with some tearful goodbyes.There is a huge wave before them and anyone who passes through or over it will never return.Caspian is tempted to go to his father but thinks the better of it.Reepicheep the mouse is there and he longs to see Aslan's country and gets his wish.Edmund,Lucy and Eustace must return home;Eustace will be able to return but Lucy and Edmund will never do so,as they have grown up.As they go through the parted wall of water they are returned to their room with the painting on the floor.All the water retreats into its' frame and all is dry,like nothing ever happened.Lucy and Edmund leave the room deep in thought,as Eustace returns the painting to its original spot on the wall.The ending to the film on the beach with Aslan,is very,very touching and even this hardened old reviewer can't help but to fight back a few tears.As I said the film is a step up from the previous one and it certainly moves along at a good pace.The S/Fx are excellent and bring CS Lewis' visions to brilliant life.All the relevant main characters from the last and previous film are here;as in NO subs,which is a relief.It certainly keeps the feeling and the continuity there which is a big plus.The acting is wonderful and Will Poulter as Eustace really plays the spoiled and annoying one well,without ever going overboard.Technically this film is in its original a/r of 1:78:1 and is both clear and crisp.Extras include the trailer,deleted scenes and commentary.All in all a better film than the last and a worthy successor in the line of CS Lewis stories,staying as true,as Hollywood can,to the books.Recommended.",4,Fox comes up to speed with the third movie,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,6661,"['Narnia', 'Voyage', 'Dawn', 'treader', 'Dec/10', 'third', 'sequel', 'series', 'far.Disney',

195079,AE31M52VLKOG6,1616842490,Robert G Yokoyama,"[6, 7]","The Chronicles Of Narnia- The Voyage Of Dawn Treader is a good movie but not a great one. It is actually the third book of CS Lewis Narnia series of books that has been made into a movie. The first was The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe and the second was Prince Caspian from a couple of years ago. Michael Apted directs this third film. There are some shots in this movie that are absolutely incredible.The visual aspect of the film is the strongest thing about it. There is a scene where our young heroes are transported to Narnia via a portrait of the ocean on the wall in their bedroom. This scene is neat to look at. There is another scene that involves a fire breathing dragon being turned back into a boy. There is another scene with Georgie Henley, She makes it start snowing after reading a spell from a book.Georgie Henley shows promise as an actress in her role as Lucy. She is a young teenager now. She struggles to love and accept herself in the movie. This is an interesting theme of the picture. Ben Barnes returns as captain of the dawn treader and newcomer Will Poulter has his moments as cousin Eustace. The casting of this movie is not the problem. The problem is the lack of drama in the picture. I never felt our heroes were in any sense of danger or dread. There is a battle with a sea serpent, but that is about it. I realize that the movie follows the plot of the book, so I wasn't expecting that much physical conflict.

195083,AHT60YWC3QIMI,1616842490,Robert Thorbury,"[9, 12]","Right up front, I'll note that I'm not a dyed-in-the-wool purist when it comes to adapting books into movies.  Sometimes elements in the plot of a book just won't cut it on the big screen, and adjustments need to be made.  Case in point:  I had few problems with Peter Jackson's treatment of my childhood favorite, ""The Lord of The Rings"".So what am I to think of these Narnia movies, based on my other childhood favorite books?The first movie, ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"", was pretty faithful to the book, so I had few complaints.  There was no way ""Prince Caspian"" could have been filmed as it was written, but that whole pointless attack on Lord Miraz's castle really had me scratching my head.  Still, I liked ""Prince Caspian"" and saw it twice in the theater.As for the third film, ""Voyage of The Dawn Treader"", it departs from the book in a number of significant ways.  Sometimes this is good, sometimes not so good.------------------------Since I consider ""Dawn Treader"" to be an OK movie, let me start with the numerous things I liked.What I really loved about the ""Dawn Treader"" book was its sense of adventure, an epic voyage into the great unknown.  It was always my favorite of the series.  Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, along with their incredibly geeky and obnoxious cousin, Eustace Clarence Scrubb, fall into a suddenly animated picture of a Narnian sea vessel, only to find themselves actually treading water in the Narnian universe.  They are rescued from drowning by King Caspian, and are taken on board his marvelous little ship.Having secured his kingdom, Caspian is on a voyage of discovery into the East.  His primary mission is to discover the fate of seven Telmarine lords of Narnia who were friends of his father, but were exiled by usurper King Miraz.  Along with Caspian is Reepicheep, a talking mouse who is fulfilling his own destiny, prophesied since he was an infant.Throughout the story, our favorite characters learn something about themselves while landing on fantastic new islands and, occasionally, escaping potentially deadly traps.  Eustace at one point is literally transformed.  Lucy has to learn how to confront her envy of her big sister, Susan.  Caspian, as king, must understand that he can't always please himself.  Edmund is just Edmund, kind of an anchor for the others.  He's grown a lot since the first book.Will Poulter, the actor who plays Eustace in the film, is absolutely brilliant -- he nailed the character perfectly.  I have no complaints there.  Lucy was always my favorite Narnia character, and Georgie Henley does a fine job with her.  Ben Barnes plays a good Caspian -- and good riddance to that goofy Spanish accent he had in the last movie.I liked Reepicheep as well.  Perfectly believable, and not the least bit ""cutesy"" as in the previous film.  I really could believe in his essential nobility, a mouse with the heart of a lion.I also enjoyed the way the movie handled the conflict between Eustace and Reepicheep.  It was much more good-natured than in the book, and more playful.In the movie, Edmund has been given his own set of issues he has to deal with, and his own growing to do.  It's not easy being a king for years, then suddenly being stuffed back into the body of a kid who isn't even old enough to fight for his own king and country in World War II.  So I'll accept the movie's treatment of him as well.For a two-hour film, the islands as described in the book are too many, so some are combined.  Fair enough.I can see the logic in the transformation of Eustace lasting longer than in the book, so as to spread it out over more islands.  Eustace gets a better chance to prove his own worth that way.The music, by David Arnold, is very pleasant.  I've known about him since the movie ""Stargate"", and the ""Dawn Treader"" theme melody is still going through my mind as I write this.  It works for the film.The effects are perfectly serviceable.  Long gone are the days when a flying dragon or a talking beast would have looked impossibly cheesy.  I saw the film in 3D, but suspect the 2D experience would have been just as satisfying -- and considerably easier on my pocketbook.A nice touch:  During the end credits, they showed a number of Pauline Baynes' classic drawings from the book.------------------------And now, on to a few aspects of the movie that I'm not so wild about.A major point of departure between the book and the movie comes early on, when our heroes get to the Lone Islands.  As in the book, they get captured by slavers.  Very much unlike in the book, some of these unfortunate slaves are being sacrificed to a mysterious green mist which is threatening to take over the world.Huh???It gets odder.  It turns out that, for some mysterious reason, our heroes find themselves on a quest to collect seven ancient swords and deliver them to Aslan's Table on Ramandu's Island.  If they fail, the whole world will go into the proverbial tank.  And then there's the scary dark island, like a festering sore on the map of the ocean, Ground Zero for all the nastiness seeping into the world.My problem with all this?  It isn't very well explained.  How could it be?  There just isn't enough time.  It feels contrived.I can accept departures from the book when they make sense, but I can't make much sense of the green mist and the seven swords.  It's like a connect-the-dots sort of puzzle, a rote exercise rather than a voyage of discovery.  It vaguely reminds me of a video game I once played.  Green Myst, or something.  But without the interesting puzzles.The bit with the Dufflepuds on Coriakin's island seems very muddled and rushed.Somehow, I've concluded after much thought, the filmmakers had to get Lucy inside Coriakin's house.  There, she would face a very serious test to her integrity, when she starts meddling with things she perhaps ought to leave alone.  Coriakin, the magician, also has to give our heroes some vital information.So, the film couldn't just leave the island out, but then the Dufflepuds didn't really seem to belong, either.  Rather than being kind of funny and even likeable, they end up being a throwaway plot device.  Maybe the film should have dispensed with them altogether.  Coriakin could have met the voyagers on the beach instead.  He has a problem, he tells them, and needs Lucy's help.Caspian's own major character test comes almost as an afterthought, at the very end of the movie, and has little drama.  And, wasn't there supposed to be something important about Ramandu's daughter?  If they ever film ""The Silver Chair"", this part might become relevant.All in all, the movie was over too quickly.  It's noteworthy that it is the shortest installment of the trilogy.Oh, well.  I'm hoping that they'll come out with an extended edition DVD which might flesh things out a bit, giving these new plot elements more context.If you're a long-time Narnia fan, you'll probably want to check this movie out at some point.  But if you do see it, be prepared for it going off in some very odd directions.",3,(3-1/2 Stars) What's With The Green Mist And The Swords?,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,7032,"['Right', 'up', 'front',

But the photo Amazon includes does not show this case as being anything other than the standard plastic case with a sleeve.Which I would have loved. But nothing I hate more than a crappy storage case for a 3 disc blockbuster title.I have included pics. I give this product 3 stars for ""OK"". Even though I hate it. If you want a movie review, check out the many movie review sites. If you want a film transfer review for video and audio quality, check out blu-ray.com.This is one of the most annoying storage cases I have owned. The worst was the Toy Story complete box set, which was so bad that I returned it at a loss and bought all the films individually with multiple versions just to have the better cases.So what makes this storage so bad? Check out the pics. It's basically paper sleeves for the discs (2 of 3), folded together. And then that folded mess it stuffed into a box sleeve, and then that sleeve is pushed into the box sleeve you see in Amazon's photo. If they would have duplicated the outer box art and disc specs from the front and back, onto the internal Box sleeve, I could at least ditch the outer box sleeve and store just the inner box sleeve on the shelf. But the inner box (while it does have specs like rating, time, etc on the back) is not as detailed as the outer box sleeve.So it's annoying when having to get out the discs and more importantly I don't trust paper sleeves to protect the finish of the discs due to sliding motions across the disc surface.Again, no other choice if you want BD and DVD in the same purchase/set. And even if I wanted to spend more and buy them separately, you can't on Amazon. They sell the DVD only or this set. I wish everyone would just stick to the standard BD case or case/sleeve.UPDATE: It's not even standard BD case height! They could have at least made this crappy box look good on the shelf with all the other Blu-Rays. Who wants to mix their BD movies with their DVD cases?

It was one of those movies that just made me happy, that filled me with a sense of adventure and lightheartedness.As for an adaption of the book, which I love, it stunk. It wasn't as drastic a change as, say, The Lightening Thief; I'd more compare it to Eragon (but with much better acting and affects) or Inkheart. Stuck to the basic story, took out a lot, put in a lot, and shifted stuff around. There was this whole theme with finding seven swords and stopping this evil mist, none of which was in the book. I guess they wanted to make it more `epic' but I think the book was epic enough. I thought the island of dreams was much scarier in the book, when we didn't know what it was until too late. Wish the movie had focused as much on Caspian and the seven lords as the book did.There are reviews that cover this movie better than I can, but my say is, if you're not going to mourn too hard over what could have been, if you think you can enjoy something  that isn't totally Dawn Treader, but still has plenty of Narnia magic, fun, and laughs, go for it.

The tone of 2010's movies has been oppressive - IRON MAN's depressed hero, HARRY POTTER's death count, TRON . . . just dark and dreary all around . . .This one, conversely, was sunshine, fun, adventure, with no weighty subject matter, no death toll, no depression . . . just fun.But, it was by no means perfect.  The opening moves WAY too fast to get to Narnia and then to get the voyage on its way (all within about ten minutes).  The first two films took much more care to build up the plot.The young actors seem largely bored this time out, not trying at all to bring any life to their characters.  Georgie Henley (Lucy), who was the heart of the first two films, seems anxious to get past this one and on to bigger and better things.  Ditto, Skandar Keynes and Ben Barnes (Edmund and Caspian). Only newcomer Will Poulter (as the whiny Eustace) brings any strength of character, balancing out the otherwise dull performances with a very exuberant (albeit annoying at first) level of gravitas to his role.And the plot . . . the plot . . . hmm, well . . . not really so much a plot as a thin string upon which to hang a series of adventures.  The focus at first is to find the seven missing lords of Prince Caspian's newly restored kingdom.  But this seques into a quest to discover the source of, and eliminate a pesky Green Mist that has stolen away many of the inhabitants of one of the islands the crew visits. This technically constitutes a storyline, but there isn't anything resembling the central conflicts of the previous two films.But, these gripes are quickly put aside by those who are able to simply enjoy a fantastical and fun film.  The truth is, after about thirty minutes, I no longer cared about the rushed opening and lack of solid performances or storyline, and simply enjoyed the grandiose effects, fanciful encounters (loved the invisible gnomes)and an awesome grand finale that gives the viewer the sailor-vs-sea beast battle that PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN 3 robbed us of!As long as you can prepare your mind for this being less epic than the previous entries, and understand it is going to be more of a popcorn-munching series of adventures, you can really find a lot to enjoy in this third installment!",4,"Enjoyable if only because, unlike most of 2010's movies, this one is light and fun.",1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2343,"['literally', 'falling', 'asleep', 'TRON', 'yesterday', 'VOYAGE', 'THE', 'DAWN', 'TREADER', 'really', 'seemed', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'tone', '2010', 'movies', 'been', 'oppressive', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'depressed', 'hero', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'death', 'count', 'TRON', 'just', 'dark', 'dreary', 'around', 'one', 'conversely', 'was', 'sunshine', 'fun', 'adventure', 'weighty', 'subject', 'matter', 'death', 'toll', 'depression', 'just', 'fun.But', 'was', 'means', 'perfect', 'opening', 'WAY', 'too', 'fast', 'get', 'Narnia', 'then', 'get', 'voyage', 'way', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'took', 'much', 'more', 'care', 'build', 'up', 'plot.The', 'young', 'actors', 'seem', 'largely', 'bored', 'time', 'out', 'not', 'trying', 'bring', 'life', 'characters', 'Georgie', 'Henley', 'Lucy', 'who', 'was', 'heart', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'anxious', 'get', 'one', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'Ditto', 'Skandar', 'Keynes', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'Edmund', 'Caspian', 'Only', 'newcomer', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'whiny', 'Eustace', 'strength', 'character', 'balancing', 'out', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'performances', 'very', 'exuberant', 'annoying', 'first', 'level', 'gravitas', 'role.And', 'plot', 'plot', 'hmm', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'thin', 'string', 'upon', 'hang', 'series', 'adventures', 'focus', 'first', 'find', 'seven', 'missing', 'lords', 'Prince', 'Caspian', 'newly', 'restored', 'kingdom', 'quest', 'discover', 'source', 'eliminate', 'pesky', 'Green', 'Mist', 'stolen', 'away', 'many', 'inhabitants', 'one', 'islands', 'crew', 'technically', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'anything', 'resembling', 'central', 'conflicts', 'previous', 'two', 'films.But', 'gripes', 'are', 'quickly', 'put', 'aside', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'fantastical', 'fun', 'film', 'truth', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'no', 'longer', 'cared', 'rushed', 'opening', 'lack', 'solid', 'performances', 'storyline', 'simply', 'enjoyed', 'grandiose', 'effects', 'fanciful', 'encounters', 'loved', 'invisible', 'gnomes', 'awesome', 'grand', 'finale', 'viewer', 'sailor-vs-sea', 'beast', 'battle', 'PIRATES', 'THE', 'CARRIBBEAN', '3', 'robbed', 'As', 'long', 'can', 'prepare', 'mind', 'being', 'less', 'epic', 'previous', 'entries', 'understand', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'popcorn-munching', 'series', 'adventures', 'can', 'really', 'find', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'third', 'installment']",N/A

Lewis' epic Christian Fantasy series. Here, Edmund and Lucy Prevensie, along with their cousin Eustace, return to the world of Narnia, and join King Caspian on journey to find the seven Lords of Telmar banished by Lord Miraz. It is not long however before they must come to face a threat from the Dark Island, a dark force that threatens the very existence of Narnia itself. Each must find courage, and face temptation, on the ultimate journey to Aslan's Country.Like the previous entry, ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" does make several changes in the adaptation from book to screen. But while the changes made to ""Prince Caspian"" did little to enhance the story, the changes made here actually help to make a cohesive narrative out of what was a more episodic book. The film was sure to be in good hands with director Michael Apted, a man who has shown himself capable of handling both thrilling action (The World Is Not Enough) and dramatic storytelling (Amazing Grace). Here, both serve him well. The cast and crew do a commendable job of bringing the film to the big screen.

195107,A1PD5Z6COH593W,1616842490,S. Yu,"[2, 3]","Any cinematic adaptation of a popular literary work must find a balance between hewing to the book and appealing to moviegoers. The stakes in this case are well-known: the fate of the Narnia franchise depended on Voyage of the Dawn Treader's box office take. In order to appeal to the largest and most reliable crowd--families with young children--the screenwriters had to keep the plot fast and simple enough to ensure that kids wouldn't get confused or bored. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is more challenging to adapt than other books in the series because of its lack of an obvious conflict and its episodic, slow-and-go narrative. For the film, the writers added an enemy (green mist), merged several book scenes, and changed the order of events to create a buildup of dramatic tension that wasn't in the book. Aside from the contrived Green Mist archenemy, I think they did a very good job.I evaluate this movie primarily as a grownup who enjoys the entire series of books, Dawn Treader most of all. To me, the first of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films is the standard for cinematic adaptations of classic fantasy literature. Its acting, writing, and cinematography did justice to the spirit and content of the original work.As I watched Voyage of the Dawn Treader I couldn't shake the impression that all the characters were being carried along by a story in a rush to be completed under two hours and under budget. There were no lingering silences, few moments in which a facial expression or a tone of voice were given time to add texture and emphasis to a line of dialogue. Cameras that were usually zoomed in on characters' faces and upper bodies amplified the dearth of nuance. I believe that wider angles sometimes and more inclusion of the very pretty backgrounds would have mitigated.Character development was uneven. Edmund and King Caspian, whose motives and conflicts were wholly internal, got short shrift on screen. Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep evolved naturally and believably. Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes and Ben Barnes demonstrated better acting ability in the earlier movies, so perhaps they and the director were hindered by time constraints and the cut-to-chase script. That rushed script also forced the morality lessons to be more plainly presented in the film than in the book, though they were not the Sunday school lectures some had feared. Aside from the Green Mist, the questionable camera work, and the rush over nuance in exposition, Voyage of the Dawn Treader excelled.The bond between Eustace and Reepicheep was lovingly and faithfully depicted and developed, and their respective Dragon and Mouse were rendered beautifully in CGI. Aslan, with his lush mane and Liam Neeson voice, inspired awe in every second he appeared. Scenes and backgrounds looked at once convincing and fantastic. The final battle at sea was as intense and dynamic as any from Pirates of the Caribbean.The film falls far short of Lord of the Rings overall, therefore I feel lukewarm about it as an adult filmgoer.Because I believe, however, that almost any elementary school age child would overlook Voyage of the Dawn Treader's flaws while being dazzled by its charms, I wholeheartedly endorse this film for children.Here's hoping that The Silver Chair makes it to the big screen, and gives viewers no less than a two hour escape to Narnia.",4,"Five stars for the kids.

On top of that, once I did make it to the main feature, something did not look right:  I realized that the movie, which had been shown theatrically with a screen ratio of 2.35:1, was being shown at a ratio of 1.78:1, which was not the wide-screen experience I was expecting.On the whole, an enjoyable film (albeit the least of the three) but presented in a bummer of a manner.",3,"Film = Four Stars, Presentation = Two Stars",1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,819,"['Having', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'theatrical', 'run', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'problem', 'started', 'packaging', 'horrible', 'cardboard', 'case', 'flimsy', 'trying', 'extricate', 'discs', 'found', 'exasperating', 'finally', 'freeing', 'disc', 'inserting', 'player', 'found', 'buttons', 'menu', 'were', 'so', 'light', 'was', 'impossible', 'determine', 'what', 'selection', 'was', 'making', 'top', 'once', 'did', 'make', 'main', 'feature', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'right', 'realized', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'theatrically', 'screen', 'ratio', '2.35:1', 'was', 'being', 'shown', 'ratio', '1.78:1', 'was', 'not', 'wide-screen', 'experience', 'was', 'expecting.On', 'whole', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'least', 'three', 'presented', 'bummer', 'manner']",N/A

Having never read the books in this series I have no idea if this is actually the last movie or not, but I have a feeling it is.  Not only because of the way it ended, but because this movie didn't do nearly as well as the others.  I did enjoy this series, but I will admit they didn't really stand out as amazing to me.  I liked them all about the same, they all were a little slow with great action at the end.  Unlike the ""Harry Potter"" series this one is geared toward a fun family night, Disney mixed with C.S. Lewis has something to do with that.  I think sadly, that is part of the reason that it's not as popular as that series or the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy.

195119,A1XOQOW2HJSOIV,1616842490,"Trekkintheplains ""Take a sad song and make it...","[7, 8]","I prefer the 1980's BBC versions I grew up with from PBS.  At least they got the storylines mostly right!  The whole point of the Voyage of the Dawn Treader is for the 7 lost lords who were great friends of Caspian's father and banished by evil uncle Miraz to be found and for Caspian to venture to the farthest Eastern end of the world. Telemarines has been afraid of the water and the East because of Aslan, so Caspian is trying to make Narnia a seafaring nation again with this revolutionary voyage.  Some people say this book isn't exciting enough for a full-length feature film.  Oh, ok, I see, so being kidnapped by slavers and reconquering the Lone Islands, running across an island belonging to a fallen star and inhabited by invisible, one-footed beings, a fight over an island where the water turns anything to gold, being lost and becoming a dragon only to be turned human again when a lesson is learned, meeting a star at rest who eats a berry from the sun every morning, encountering a sea serpent, coming to an island where nightmares come true, and coming to the edge of the world isn't exciting enough???  This was my favorite book of the series growing up!Why, oh WHY was there this absolute B.S. about a green mist, people disappearing in boats as sacrifices, 7 swords beings united, etc etc???  Why did the story need it?  It felt tacked-on to me.  So many of my favorite scenes were forever fatally skewed and destroyed by this interpretation.  This was not The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, it was another story entirely that was vaguely based on said book.  Kids are too easily bored these days if the grand seafaring adventure the book was isn't enough for them.Here are all the things this movie got wrong:1.) Governor Gumpas isn't present at all, Lord Bern is in a dungeon, and we see the advent of the ridiculous ""Green mist."" What really happens is: Upon reaching the Lone Islands, Caspian, Eustace, Edmund, Lucy, and Reepicheep set across an empty island. They are all captured by slavers and taken to market.  Caspian is rescued by Lorn Bern who married a local girl and settled in the islands after leaving his companions to go on. They raise a small army and use a clever set of maneuvers to fool the idiot Governor Gumpas into believing Caspian has come to re-conquer the islands.  Gumpas is unseated and Bern is made a Duke.2.) The island of Coriakin comes WAY too soon! It belongs WAY further along in the series, after Eustace becomes good, before the encounter with the sea serpent.  Lucy isn't kidnapped, ever. She sees their footprints first and hears them, runs to her group, the whole group is surrounded after they see the house, lands, orchards, etc.  They are wined and dined and Lucy volunteers to undo the invisibility spell to keep her comrades safe. She sees the beauty spell but Aslan talks to her and she leaves it alone, she NEVER steals it! She makes friends with the fallen star (the movie never mentions he's a fallen star and caring for the Dufflepuds is his atonement) and he gives them guidance for the rest of their journey.  Again, NO GREEN MIST!!!3.) In the REAL story: The calm comes when Eustace is still a rotten kid.  He steals water, Reepicheep catches him.  Reepicheep later gets to go at him with a sword because Eustace pulled his tail while he was on lookout from the mouth of the dragon.4.) Deathwater Island and the Dragon Island are NOT the same thing!  In the book: The group camps out early on at the island of the dragon. Eustace wanders off, sees a dragon, sees the dragon die, finds the treasure in a cave, falls asleep, becomes a dragon.  He's terrified at first until he realizes he's the dragon.  Then he comes onto the beach, is challenged, then Lucy realizes who it is.  He finds how lonely he is as a dragon.  They spend many days on the island repairing the ship after the terrible storms they encountered.  See, they are tossed about in a tempest for days on end, the water supply runs low, they make it to the island, Eustace becomes a dragon and finds how fulfilling it is to be useful and have companionship.  Then Aslan comes to him and takes him to a pool where he keeps scraping several skins off himself until Aslan splits his skin deep and throws him into the pool.  Eustace is a boy again and a better one after he realizes how rotten he'd been before and how much he liked being nice and people being nice to him in return.  The bracelet Eustace wore the entire time proves the dragon he saw die was probably the lost Lord Octesian.  Eustace NEVER leaves the island as a dragon!! They know he could never ride on the ship or have the strength to fly.  Ridiculous.5.) At Deathwater Island, they find what they think is a statue, but realize when a shell is dipped into the water that he was once human. Remaining clothing and gear prove him to be Lord Restimar.  Caspian and Edmund fight as the thought of endless riches has a dangerously intoxicating effect, until Aslan interferes and speaks to both of them in their minds. They leave the island, never revealing its terrible secret. There is never a rivalry between Caspian and Edmund over who is the higher king.6.) The sea serpent wasn't part of Edmund's imagination, it was REAL.  It really did attack the ship and try to squeeze it in two.  It was only defeated by the efforts of everyone on the ship.  It was pushed over the stern of the ship and they sailed away before it could get its wits about it and come back to attack again.7.) The dark island is, yes, where they found Lord Rhoop.  But, it was not the source of some overpowering evil!  It was simply a place where nightmares came true.  It was a dark place in the ocean.  They sailed in when none of them wanted to be called cowards by Reepicheep for avoiding a possible adventure, found Lord Rhoop who was mad with years of residing there, were lured by the idea of dreams coming true, found out they were really nightmares, and then found they could not get out. An albatross came and led them out when Lucy called to Aslan for help. The island was destroyed in the process.8.) The Island of Ramandu was NOT as early as the movie made it! It was the last island before Aslan's country.  The crew actually meets Ramandu, who tells them he is a star at rest.  The story of the fireberries from the sun, and the birds that bring them, how the food is renewed every day, and how Ramandu will rise again as a new star, is SO beautiful! They left ALL of that out!  Awful!! They find the remaining 3 lost Lords, asleep at the table for years because they had fought about staying or continuing on, and one had picked up the stone knife that was used by the White Witch to kill Aslan in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.  Before Ramandu's daughter explains this, they are speculating and think the food is to blame.  The the daughter explains that to wake the lords, they must sail as far East as their ship can take them, then leave at least one passenger behind.  Then Caspian (who has been looking for a wife but unable to find one he cars for) alludes to the tale of Sleeping Beauty and promises Ramandu's daughter that he will return for her. The crew nearly mutinies at the idea of carrying on, but Caspian manages to get all but one on board.9.) In the book: They sail on, the sun gets brighter, and they find they are caught in water they assume is forever rushing to the edge of the world and beyond it. They fear they may all be washed up and crash over the edge, but then find it is a broad channel they can steer out of if they wish onto calm water.  Lucy sees people who live under the sea, and their forests and castles.  Reepicheep tries to challenge one of them and falls into the water.  It is here he discovers the water is sweet, just like in the song the dryad sang over him as a baby.  They know they are near Aslan's country. A great lake of lilies grows for miles and miles, and they drink the sweet water to strengthen their eyes against the growing strength of the sun. The beauty is that they are getting nearer and nearer the sun the whole time, and daily they see the birds flying to Ramandu's Island to grant him youth and renew the feast.  Another beautiful part that was LEFT OUT!!10.) The Dawn Treader doesn't dump Caspian, Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep in the boat to find their way to a sandbar where Aslan is!  Really, it sails until it can sail no longer. Caspian then declares he will be the one left behind to find himself in Aslan's Country. He gets in a fight with Drinian, Edmund, and Lucy then storms into his cabin. There, Aslan talks to him, and he comes back to say he sees now that he must return to rule his country and take Ramandu's daughter as a bride.  Aslan tells him Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep must continue on, as Reepicheep wishes to partake in the biggest adventure of all.  They go to a spit of land where Aslan greets them and tells Edmund and Lucy they cannot return to Narnia.  Reepicheep gives up his sword, and continues on in his little coracle. The three children are returned to the bedroom where it all started and are great friends afterwards.At least the movie got the beginning and ending right, but that's about it.  All the other events are so out of sequence, mixed together, or changed in some integral way that I cannot appreciate the movie for what it is.  Too many things that were dear to me were changed too much.  I can't enjoy it for what it is.  Through the whole thing, all I could think was ""that didn't happen!"" and ""that's now how/when that happened!""Screenwriters: stop messing with classics!  These are classics for a reason, beloved for decades for a REASON!  Why do you think you can improve on something so well-loved already?  Why do you think your ideas are better or more exciting?  These books will remain classics for many, many years to come, while these interpretations fade into obscurity.  The reason Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader weren't great successes is because you CHANGED them too much!!!  Can't you see that??Bottom line: Change is NOT always a good thing!!!",2,"Take a childhood classic, scramble it up, dump in some dumb story ideas and you have this movie.",1317168000,"09 28,

195121,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1616842490,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" the third installment of the saga, follows the adventures of Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes), two youngest Pevensie children summoned once again to the world of Narnia, this time with their sulky cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter) in tow. Lucy and Edmund reunite with Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) and a sword-wielding warrior mouse Reepicheep (voice Simon Pegg replacing Eddie Izzard), they set forth to brave the dangers of unknown seas in order to find the secrets of the seven missing lords of Narnia and the mysterious green mist.Even if you haven't read the C.S. Lewis's original books (I only read ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe""), you will notice there have been changes done to the story. The film adaptation is action-packed, but feels rather lengthy in the mid-section. Character development is shown - Lucy is tempted by her own desire, and Eustace literally undergoes transformation - but not enough, and the process is not very convincing. Two male characters Caspian and Edmund are almost unmemorable throughout.Still, ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" has impressive production designs (such as the titular ship) and the visual effects including one rousing battle scene. But probably the film's best part would be its moving ending, which defines the entire third installment. Without spoiling too much, I can say it is time to say good-bye. It has been five years since the first ""Narnia"" was released, in which Lucy found a lamppost behind the old wardrobe and met Mr. Tumnus. Time has passed very quickly.Narnia looks less magical than it used to (or should) be, perhaps because we have seen so many fantasy movies made recently.

195124,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,1616842490,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[0, 0]","So things are changing in the world of the Pevense kids. Peter and Susan have left for America while Edmond and Lucy are till stuck in England under the same roof of their annoying and Nerdy cousin Eustace. Suddenly, they are summoned back to Narnia and they board the strongest ship in the Narnian Navy, The Dawn Treader. Under the watchful eyes of Caspian the group is off on an adventure of a lifetime into the unknown wondering that they would find.This time around, I have to say I was not too satisfied. I know that the biggest (yet suttle) change was the transition of the film franchise from Disney to Fox. One thing you can definitely tell is the fact that the movie didn't seem all that magical and mystical as the first two. The acting was fine and the film does have a few great moments. Eustace was definitely a major hit for me. I love characters that solely base their worlds around facts and when they suddenly discover something that doesn't seem natural they try and figure out how it can possibly be natural. Will Poltier did a great job working off of Simon Pegg (The new voice of Reepicheep, fyi you will never figure out that the voice was changed).Unfortunately, the weak point of the movie for me was just the story. I am all for going out on a journey, but this one was just very slow with high point popping in. The ending of the film was probably the best part, because it was a very emotional one and there is a moment that will make you smile.So I am glad I saw 'The Voyage of the Dawn Treader', but now I am wondering what will happen now. It has been announced that the next film will be 'The Magicians' Nephew' so we will be getting a prequel.

Again the Pevensies are drawn back into this magical world, though this time it's just Edmund and Lucy as they are on the verge of leaving their early childhood behind and ready to embrace being adults. Drawn into the adventure with them is their younger cousin Eustace Scrubb, who thinks that Narnia is a bunch of fairy tale rubbish until he sees and experiences its magic (both good and bad) for himself. It's sad to see that this will be the last adventure for the Pevensies as they must now grow to become adults, but the story at the end hints that it won't be the last that anyone from the outside world will ever see of Narnia or its ""lion king"" Aslan.Overall, it's a great fantasy film for children, and I would definitely recommend it along with the other two Narnia films.",5,"The ""Wind Waker"" Narnia tale",1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,1288,"['never', 'read', 'books', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'series', 'do', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'Walden', 'Media', 'put', 'out', 'are', 'based', 'books', 'Even', 'change', 'distributors', 'film', 'quality', 'still', 'top-notch', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'great', 'CGI', 'characters', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'time', 'seafaring', 'adventure', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'compare', 'Nintendo', 'Legend', 'Zelda', 'Wind', 'Waker', 'character', 'cast', 'Narnia', 'books', 'Again', 'Pevensies', 'are', 'drawn', 'back', 'magical', 'world', 'time', 'just', 'Edmund', 'Lucy', 'are', 'verge', 'leaving', 'early', 'childhood', 'ready', 'embrace', 'being', 'adults', 'Drawn', 'adventure', 'younger', 'cousin', 'Eustace', 'Scrubb', 'who', 'Narnia', 'bunch', 'fairy', 'tale', 'rubbish', 'magic', 'good', 'bad', 'sad', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'adventure', 'Pevensies', 'must', 'now', 'grow', 'become', 'adults', 'story', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', 'anyone', 'outside', 'world', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'Narnia', 'lion', 'king', 'Aslan.Overall', 'great', 'fantasy', 'film', 'children', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'other', 'two', 'Narnia', 'films']",N/A

195129,A2Q31IVRP9MYQX,1616842490,"William L. Isley, Jr.","[18, 20]","I recently watched the movie version of Lewis's book The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.  I left entertained but not satisfied; so I decided to read the book again, which is my favorite in the series.  After finishing, I see three reasons that the movies fall short of the books.First, there is a literary error.  The moviemakers appear to understand the books as children's adventure stories with a spiritual twist.  This causes them to make the films into family-friendly action-adventure flicks.  One wonders how they will be able to handle the increasingly mature themes in the later books.This leads them to put their cinematographic efforts into battles and miss the opportunity to rise up to the creative challenge of putting into pictures Lewis's vivid portrayals of spiritual truths and experiences.The result is that the scenes with Aslan or those that broach the spiritual dimension seem anemic.These errors affect negatively the movie version of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.  Three scenes or themes fail to live up to the book.  Consequently, a potentially classic children's movie of spiritual import becomes just a forgettable, albeit enjoyable, action-adventure movie.The first failure is Eustace's transformation from a dragon back into a boy.  Now, the movie does capture the delightfully nasty Eustace quite well, but its portrayal of Aslan the lion pawing the ground to remove the dragon skin from Eustace is tepid.  In the book the transformation is brutally vivid.  Eustace the dragon actually removes three layers of skin before Aslan has to take over.  When Aslan does, his claws tear so deeply that Eustace feels as if the lion has cut into his heart.  The book paints a striking picture of our inability to remove sin and the need for Christ to remove it.  Was it thought that the book is too graphic for a ""family"" movie?The second failure is the dark island where everyone's dreams come true.  The movie pulls out all stops to create an exciting fight against a sea serpent, but this is child's play in comparison to the horrific imaginative possibilities of Lewis's writing.  In the book, while the crew in panic desperately tries to row out of the darkness after being warned that it is a place of nightmares, those nightmares begin to take form.  They hear unnamed creatures crawling up the sides of the ship, see something on the mast and hear the sound of scissors opening and closing and are unable to find their way out of the darkness.  In answer to Lucy's prayer Aslan comes as an albatross and leads them to the light.  One experiences powerfully the relief of being delivered from a nightmare.  Surely with our technology this is a scene that the movie could have captured for us.  Were they too afraid of frightening children to use all the techniques of horror films to show us a nightmare?However, the movie's greatest failure is not being able to portray the main element of the story--sailing to the world's end and Aslan's land.  It starts badly. One can barely hear Reepicheep's recital of the dryad's words over his cradle about finding all he'd seek where sky and water meet.  And nowhere in the film does one catch Reepicheep's passionate longing to sail east in the Dawn Treader, and, when she fails, to paddle east in his coracle, when it sinks to swim east with his four paws, and, when he can swim no longer and hasn't reached Aslan's land or plunged over a cataract at the world's end, to sink with his nose to the sunrise.Lewis is a visual author and the last chapters of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader are perhaps his best.  It is a shame that the makers of the movie did not use all the marvelous cinematic techniques to allow us to see Lewis's magical mystical descriptions of the end of the voyage.  What a joy it would have been to experience vicariously via film the crew's journey into the sun with shining faces, drinking liquid light while sailing through the whiteness of the Silver Sea of lilies shot with gold.This is Lewis's fictional portrayal of ""joy,"" that sweet longing for something that is always just out of our grasp in this world.  This was the central experience used to bring him to God.  For this reason The Voyage of the Dawn Treader takes the form of a quest, like the search for the Holy Grail.  This is the great adventure.While rereading those wonderful pages, my heart was filled to overflowing, and, when Reepicheep disappeared over the great wave, I burst into tears and cried out as I thought of my sins, for I am a Calvinist, ""I have wasted my inheritance for a mess of pottage.""

Sadly, that effort was followed by the critically-panned ""Prince Caspian"" (which I did not even view due to all the poor reviews and word of mouth).  Luckily, ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" brings back in the old Narnian magic in this grand installment!For a basic plot summary, ""Voyage"" sees the younger Pevensie siblings, Edmund (Skander Keynes) & Lucy (Georgie Henley), as well as their cousin Eustace (Will Poulter), once again drawn back into Narnia in order to help Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) defeat the last remaining threat to Narnian peace by sailing towards Aslan Country in search of lost citizens.I can think of nothing that this film really does wrong.  The acting is superb, with Caspian & Lucy's portrayals standing out even above the rest.  The action/adventure is breathtaking and should be viewed in HD if at all possible.  Plus, the general storyline taken from what is considered to be one of the better Narnia novels, is filled with imaginative twists/turns/characters that will keep you in awe.Basically, this film really brought Narnia ""alive"" for me again, as the overall production is just so rich with allegory, emotion, and adventure.  Though I once viewed this series as a sort of poor man's ""Lord of the Rings"", with this successful effort it has now carved out a niche fully its own.Thus, watch this one with the kiddies or just watch it alone with nostalgia...it really doesn't matter!
