118220,A2Y7O4ZH4H37ZU,0790748193,Alan Breck,"[1, 5]","Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn star in this stomach-turning film based on Nicholas Sparks's sappy novel.  Penn plays a Chicago Tribune researcher who finds the title ""character"" on a beach.  After her boss publishes the mushy contents, other messages appear.  Penn and her associates track down the cheesy Romeo, and she travels to his home on the North Carolina's Outer Banks.  Of course, she does not reveal the reason for her visit, and falls in love with him.  You can imagine the dramatic possibilities that follow.  In fact, you've seen them before.Almost nothing in the film rings true.  Every twist is predictable and unbelievable, devised only to tug at the heartstrings.  Could Costner truly be this obsessed with his dead wife and still love Penn- a woman with whom he has nothing in common?  Possibly, but the filmmakers make no effort to show what draws these two very different people to one another.  Instead, their attraction is assumed.  Without it there's no film.  The idea that anyone, let alone Penn's educated newspaper-woman, would even consider speaking with Costner's brooding, troubled, and occasionally violent boat-builder strains credibility.  Instead of a man with a romantic nature, we get a man caught between obsessive-compulsive disorder and a coma.Only the supporting players survive with their dignity intact.  Robbie Coltrane does a nice turn as Penn's boss, and Paul Newman triumphs over the material as Costner's crusty father.",2,Lost at Sea,1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,1471,"['Kevin', 'Costner', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'star', 'stomach-turning', 'film', 'based', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'sappy', 'novel', 'Penn', 'Chicago', 'Tribune', 'researcher', 'who', 'title', 'character', 'beach', 'boss', 'mushy', 'contents', 'other', 'messages', 'appear', 'Penn', 'associates', 'track', 'down', 'cheesy', 'Romeo', 'home', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Outer', 'Banks', 'course', 'not', 'reveal', 'reason', 'visit', 'love', 'can', 'imagine', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'follow', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.Almost', 'nothing', 'film', 'rings', 'true', 'twist', 'predictable', 'unbelievable', 'devised', 'only', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'Could', 'Costner', 'truly', 'be', 'obsessed', 'dead', 'wife', 'still', 'love', 'Penn-', 'woman', 'whom', 'nothing', 'common', 'Possibly', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'effort', 'show', 'what', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'one', 'Instead', 'attraction', 'assumed', 'film', 'idea', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'Penn', 'educated', 'newspaper-woman', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'speaking', 'Costner', 'brooding', 'troubled', 'occasionally', 'violent', 'boat-builder', 'strains', 'credibility', 'Instead', 'man', 'romantic', 'nature', 'get', 'man', 'caught', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'coma.Only', 'supporting', 'players', 'survive', 'dignity', 'intact', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'nice', 'turn', 'Penn', 'boss', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'triumphs', 'material', 'Costner', 'crusty', 'father']",Message in a Bottle VHS

If what the writers and director wanted was inarticulate from Costner, they got it, in spades. Robert Wright Penn did well with the kind of part that normally would only be found in a comedy. Actually, the plot structure never had a chance since its fundamental  premise is comedy material not suitable for straight romance. From my point of view, the basic gimmick was unworkable for the kind of film they made. The basic premise: a researcher for the Chicago Tribune, finds a message in a bottle that touches her heart. Pursuing the search for more messages, two others were found. This leads her to Kevin Costner and Romance. There are various limbs to the trunk of the plot but none of them have much effervescence to them, mostly they fall flat.

118248,A17D77DFID0GZG,0790748193,"dsrussell ""greyhater""","[4, 4]","First, there are some really fine reviews of this movie spinkled in here, especially the reviews from Mikeymkm of Dec. 19th, and Robert's of Sept 15th.  They are in disagreement over the ending, but reading their reviews  will give you an excellent idea of what this movie is all about.Like  Robert, I too saw this movie first on an airplane, and the reactions of the  passengers were identical (maybe we flew on the same plane).  As our plane  landed and people disembarked, those of us who were watching the movie  stayed until it was over--and that has to say something!Personally, I  tend to view the ending more in the vein of Mikeymkm's review, but not  because it was downbeat, more in that it seemed like a typical  Hollywood-style ending.  If they had stayed truer to the novel in this  respect (as mentioned by the North Carolina reviewer of June 12th--caution,  DO NOT read this review if you haven't seen the movie), I would have been  much more satisfied.All in all, ""Message in a Bottle"" did a lot of  things right.  It kept me in my seat and I was attracted to both the theme  and the actors, and the cinematography seemed to sweep me to Outer Banks  (or Maine, where one reviewer said it was filmed).  Still, I came away  feeling a little unsatisfied, even a little manipulated.  Between 1 and 10,  I give ""Message in a Bottle"" a marginal 7.  It is a movie I enjoyed, and  will probably view again, but it missed on the level of being a truly  memorable film, at least it did for me.",4,You can almost smell the sea....,947116800,"01 6, 2000",2000,1499,"['First', 'are', 'really', 'fine', 'reviews', 'movie', 'spinkled', 'here', 'especially', 'reviews', 'Mikeymkm', 'Dec.', '19th', 'Robert', 'Sept', '15th', 'are', 'disagreement', 'ending', 'reading', 'reviews', 'will', 'give', 'excellent', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'Robert', 'too', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'airplane', 'reactions', 'passengers', 'were', 'identical', 'maybe', 'flew', 'same', 'plane', 'plane', 'landed', 'people', 'disembarked', 'who', 'were', 'watching', 'movie', 'stayed', 'was', 'over', 'say', 'something', 'Personally', 'tend', 'view', 'ending', 'more', 'vein', 'Mikeymkm', 'review', 'not', 'was', 'downbeat', 'more', 'seemed', 'typical', 'Hollywood-style', 'ending', 'had', 'stayed', 'truer', 'novel', 'respect', 'mentioned', 'North', 'Carolina', 'reviewer', 'June', '12th', 'caution', 'DO', 'NOT', 'read', 'review', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'satisfied.All', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'did', 'lot', 'things', 'right', 'kept', 'seat', 'was', 'attracted', 'theme', 'actors', 'cinematography', 'seemed', 'sweep', 'Outer', 'Banks', 'Maine', 'where', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', 'filmed', 'Still', 'came', 'away', 'feeling', 'little', 'unsatisfied', 'even', 'little', 'manipulated', 'Between', '1', '10', 'give', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'marginal', '7', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'probably', 'view', 'again', 'missed', 'level', 'being', 'truly', 'memorable', 'film', 'least', 'did']",Message in a Bottle VHS

118250,A92LD431P843F,0790748193,E. Lambeth,"[11, 14]","Let's see. A romantic drama about a woman who searches for the man who writes beautiful missives to his dead wife.How powerful are these words? Princess Bride's journalist character travels down south to visit the man who wrote this beautiful letter in a bottle to his wife. She's intrigued by him. By his writing. How can a man love so much! She MUST know this man!Until she sees that the man who wrote this stuff is a balding, overweight guy. Well, maybe that letter wasn't THAT great. Maybe he copied it out of a book anyways. Besides that, it's silly trying to find out about a guy who wrote something very private. I think I'll go home....WAIT A MINUTE. Kevin Coster is the man that wrote that letter...not the average looking, everyday fellow that nobody would be attracted to! NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, that letter really WAS intriguing! I MUST find out more about this guy!Gimme a break. Costner's a hottie to Wright, especially since her mysteriously doesn't say much. She'll learn later that he doesn't say much because he hasn't much to say. With memorable pick up lines such as ""Do you like meat"", Costner must've been advised to keep his yap shut as much as possible...and it was brilliant advice. In fact, the more he talks in this movie, the more he puts his foot in his mouth. Wright touches dead wife's shoe (Costner leaves a room in his house untouched as a tribute to his dead wife), and that makes Costner FREAK. Costner actually spends the whole movie being quiet, giving mixed signals, pining for his dead wife, and acting like an extreme introvert. BUT THIS DOESN'T TURN OFF WRIGHT in the LEAST! Nope. She invites him to Chicago, has a sex scene with him (I guess she's loose, but it doesn't add to the romance of the movie, and seems like it doesn't really fit in the movie).Romantic dramas work with solid dialogue. There was no banter between Costner and Wright in this movie. Instead, we watch them spending time with each other, with music playing in the background in place of words, showing us that the two are having wonderful conversations, without us actually hearing what they have to say to each other. Maybe it should be assumed that they have a lot to say to each other, but why would I assume that? In the parts of the movie where they have conversation, it's awkward and the dialogue is, well, dull.The romance is unbelievable. What we have here is Wright's character acting like a desparate woman who wants a good lookin' man in her life so bad that she'll ignore obvious signs that should make her run away. Fine, if you don't sugarcoat it into looking like a classic romance between two people that naturally go together like ham n eggs. They don't. And again, NO CLEVER DIALOGUE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. I watched it in the theatre, and thought the sex scene was a half-bleep attempt at forcing a romance in our heads. Sex doesn't assume romance. It assumes sex when there's nothing else going for this couple.I've beaten that to death. Paul Newman overacted so bad it was embarrassing. I blame the director for this one. Newman knows how to act.The death scene looked like an insurance policy. As if the movie wasn't tragic and sad enough, hey let's have a death scene to jerk some tears. I know. It's what the book called for. Still, make us care about the characters more before you throw in a death scene. I didn't care. I was insulted. A man's family goes out for a pleasure sail in stormy waters. Makes sense. I'd take my wife and small child on a pleasure sail in the middle of a storm. Yes, a sailor gets storm warnings before he leaves dock or he gets it from the radio.So everybody capsizes, and Coster saves the family instead of the husband, who waits on Costner's boat for Costner to save his family. I guess the husband, seeing his family in danger, was more concerned with preventing pneumonia. Gimme a break.If you check your brain at the door, you might not find this movie to be horrible. I still don't see how you manage to find it entertaining, though. And I like Costner and Wright!This movie stinks eggs.",1,Have a gratuitious death scene to invoke emotion,1018483200,"04 11, 2002",2002,4065,"['Let', 'see', 'romantic', 'drama', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'who', 'beautiful', 'missives', 'dead', 'wife.How', 'powerful', 'are', 'words', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'journalist', 'character', 'travels', 'down', 'south', 'visit', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'beautiful', 'letter', 'bottle', 'wife', 'intrigued', 'writing', 'How', 'can', 'man', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'MUST', 'know', 'man', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'stuff', 'balding', 'overweight', 'guy', 'Well', 'maybe', 'letter', 'was', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'great', 'Maybe', 'copied', 'book', 'silly', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'guy', 'who', 'wrote', 'something', 'very', 'private', 'think', ""'ll"", 'go', 'home', 'MINUTE', 'Kevin', 'Coster', 'man', 'wrote', 'letter', 'not', 'average', 'looking', 'everyday', 'fellow', 'nobody', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'NOW', 'THINK', 'IT', 'letter', 'really', 'WAS', 'intriguing', 'MUST', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'guy', 'Gim', 'break', 'Costner', 'hottie', 'Wright', 'especially', 'mysteriously', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'later', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'memorable', 'pick', 'up', 'lines', 'such', 'Do', 'meat', 'Costner', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'advised', 'keep', 'yap', 'shut', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'was', 'brilliant', 'advice', 'fact', 'more', 'movie', 'more', 'foot', 'mouth', 'Wright', 'touches', 'dead', 'wife', 'shoe', 'Costner', 'room', 'house', 'untouched', 'tribute', 'dead', 'wife', 'Costner', 'FREAK', 'Costner', 'actually', 'whole', 'movie', 'being', 'quiet', 'giving', 'mixed', 'signals', 'pining', 'dead', 'wife', 'acting', 'extreme', 'introvert', 'BUT', 'THIS', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'TURN', 'OFF', 'WRIGHT', 'LEAST', 'Nope', 'Chicago', 'sex', 'scene', 'guess', 'loose', ""n't"", 'add', 'romance', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'movie', '.Romantic', 'dramas', 'work', 'solid', 'dialogue', 'was', 'banter', 'Costner', 'Wright', 'movie', 'Instead', 'watch', 'spending', 'time', 'other', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'place', 'words', 'showing', 'two', 'are', 'having', 'wonderful', 'conversations', 'actually', 'hearing', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'other', 'Maybe', 'should', 'be', 'assumed', 'have', 'lot', 'say', 'other', 'why', 'would', 'assume', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'have', 'conversation', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'well', 'dull.The', 'romance', 'unbelievable', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'Wright', 'character', 'acting', 'desparate', 'woman', 'who', 'good', 'lookin', 'man', 'life', 'so', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'ignore', 'obvious', 'signs', 'should', 'make', 'run', 'away', 'Fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'sugarcoat', 'looking', 'classic', 'romance', 'two', 'people', 'naturally', 'go', 'together', 'ham', 'n', 'eggs', 'do', ""n't"", 'again', 'NO', 'CLEVER', 'DIALOGUE', 'IN', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'MOVIE', 'watched', 'theatre', 'thought', 'sex', 'scene', 'was', 'half-bleep', 'attempt', 'forcing', 'romance', 'heads', 'Sex', ""n't"", 'assume', 'romance', 'sex', 'when', 'nothing', 'else', 'going', 'couple.I', ""'ve"", 'beaten', 'death', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'overacted', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'blame', 'director', 'one', 'Newman', 'how', 'act.The', 'death', 'scene', 'looked', 'insurance', 'policy', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'tragic', 'sad', 'enough', 'hey', 'let', 'have', 'death', 'scene', 'jerk', 'tears', 'know', 'what', 'book', 'called', 'Still', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'more', 'throw', 'death', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'insulted', 'man', 'family', 'out', 'pleasure', 'sail', 'stormy', 'waters', 'Makes', 'sense', ""'d"", 'take', 'wife', 'small', 'child', 'pleasure', 'sail', 'middle', 'storm', 'Yes', 'sailor', 'storm', 'warnings', 'dock', 'radio.So', 'everybody', 'Coster', 'family', 'instead', 'husband', 'who', 'Costner', 'boat', 'Costner', 'save', 'family', 'guess', 'husband', 'seeing', 'family', 'danger', 'was', 'more', 'concerned', 'preventing', 'pneumonia', 'Gim', 'break.If', 'check', 'brain', 'door', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'horrible', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'manage', 'find', 'entertaining', 'though', 'like', 'Costner', 'Wright', 'movie', 'eggs']",Message in a Bottle VHS

118257,A2P4AKDAI7ERSE,0790748193,Fred Ritzema,"[4, 4]","Thank God for films that do not follow the standard form of what is disgustingly called &quot;chic flicks&quot;.(Sorry, ladies, but it's the hard and highly-biased truth).  This movie is poetry in motion--by which I  mean Shakespearian Love Sonnets,Keats, the Brownings and Shelley.  The poem  begins with breath-taking cinematography of the Maine coastine, reaching  out toward the Atlantic.  I believe these scenes are repeated throughout  the movie to remind us that this is a seaman's story, which has, as many a  coastline villager of any country will tell you, both poetry and pain.  The  film moves along at an easy, mellow pace, giving the viewer time to guess  what really is going on in the characters' minds, and where the next fork  in the 'road of life' will go.  When you learn to love someone who &quot;is  your true north&quot;, and then lose them, think what that must feel  like--total, utter abandonment, a sick-feeling in your gut that you are  really, really ALONE.  It doesn't surprise me that Gerrett is as open as he  is toward Theresa; hugs are good for things like this, as are the things  that go along with hugs.  But Catherine is still there, much like Michelle  Pfeiffer as Gillian in &quot;To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday. There are  some heart-breaking and gut-wrenching decisions to be made, as there are in  real life.  Those who 'pooh-pooh' the ending and Gerrett's death, would be  better off reading Cinderella or eating chocolate.  It's your right to be  upset when you don't like a film's ending, but don't blast the whole movie  because of it.

Costner stars as Garret Blake, a grieving widower who has written touching letters to his wife, sealed them into bottles, and cast them into the sea.  Penn stars as Theresa Osborne, a researcher for the Chicago Tribune who discovers one of the bottles which washed up on a Cape Cod beach.Intrigued, Theresa begins to investigate the bottle and its contents.  She covers everything, right down to the manufacturer of the typewriter which the message was typed from and the letterhead that was used.  All of the clues eventually lead her to Garret and his North Carolina beachfront home.Once there, Theresa discovers that Garret is still obsessed with his lost wife, and she must confront her own growing feelings for Garret.  Despite his tough exterior, Theresa manages to break through and a loving relationship soon begins to develop.  Soon, Theresa must return to her job in Chicago, but she asks Garret to come and visit her.  Weeks later, Garret takes her up on her offer and comes to Chicago.  The romance is rekindled, but Garret discovers the messages and bottle stored in Theresa's home and becomes very upset.  Theresa assures him that she was going to tell him the entire story, but Garret is very skeptical.  Will Theresa explain her true feelings to Garret?  Will he believe her? and will their romance survive?This is a very good movie.  Robin Wright Penn and Kevin Costner are excellent, but I enjoyed Paul Newman's portrayal as Garret's father Dodge Blake the best.  His efforts to maintain his relationship with his son and his sound advice which he gave to Garret were high points of the film.  I also enjoyed Garret's boat building sequences.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[1, 1]","The one thing I abhor in a film is a story that builds emotional content, then allows the death of one of the main characters, destroying any hope of happiness. Yes, I know, such things are realistic and do happen, but give me happiness in my movies (or murder and mayhem). Don't allow me to invest in these other lives, waiting for the moment of connection only to see it crumble and crash.Robin Wright plays Theresa, a researcher for a Chicago newspaper, and Kevin Costner is Garrett, a builder of sailboats (and, to me, the ""sexiest man alive,"" not that Ryan fellow). He's been widowed for three years, meets Theresa and is finally ready to move on--slowly. She has intentionally sought him out because she found his ""message in a bottle."" As a researcher, she is interested in the puzzle; as a woman, she is interested in the emotional investment this writer has apparently put into a life with this Catherine, the intended recipient of the message. Of course, what can you expect from a smaltzy movie--he is gorgeous and thoughtful and well, just perfect--and we know these men don't exist.In no time, they have insinuated themselves into a possible relationship. He lives near a harbor, she in a big city. Maybe it'll work. But he's not quite ready. She's holding back because she hasn't told him about her research. Honesty in a relationship? Sure. Am I thinking it will work? I'm saying no--he will never leave the harbor to live anywhere else. What? She just got a promotion as a full-fledged writer for the paper (yeah, this is an old movie in a perfect world where newspapers can be held in one's hands, not on a mobile device). It looks like they are really going to get together.But, darn (WARNING: big give-away, unless you are addicted to Nicholas Sparks), yep, ol' Garrett drowns trying to save a woman from drowning. He'd already saved the husband and child. Gone. Just like that. He was so excited, too, about future possibilities--a new life with a living woman instead of mourning the dead one. Gone.Frankly, I don't appreciate a vicarious romance in a movie that ends like that with no satisfaction, no fading into the sunset, no promise of rich emotional fulfillment to come (or fights and divorce). (It reminds me of another movie with a similar ending:Nights in Rodanthewith Gere and Lane, another Sparks story). Message in this bottle? You'll be heart-broken!Actually, the movie was beautifully filmed, well-cast (although I'm not a Robin Wright fan). Costner and Paul Newman (who played his father) were perfect.

Penn plays Theresa Osbovue, a woman who falls in love with a man she has never met. A single-mom following a heart-breaking divorce, Theresa retains custody of her son Jason. On a solitary vacation while Jason visits his dad, Theresa is jogging along a remote stretch of coastline when she picks up a sand-immersed bottle containing a passionate letter signed G. The letter turns out to be a heartfelt soliloquy to Catherine. After Theresa's boss publishes the sappy note on the newspaper, Theresa unexpectedly receives a plethora of responses and oddly more letters of the same letterhead turns up at her office. The bittersweet poetry from the letter pulls Theresa's heartstrings and prompts her to search for this man known as the initial G. The movie has adopted from Sparks' novel and seen minor modifications such as the locations of places and the much. Theresa's search for Garret Blake is somewhat cut short in the movie. So if you're interested you should read the novel before watching the movie. Other than that the movie sticks with the original plot:still sad, poignant and heartbreaking, and a bit stomach-turning.

When Jason's dad takes him for a summer visit, Theresa's  journey begins at a deserted beach on Cape Cod where she finds a message in  a bottle.The message Theresa reads quite obviously tugs at her soul as  she proceeds to share it with her hostess at the bed and breakfast where  she's staying, with her co-workers back at the Tribune where she returns  one day early, and with her boss, who does her the favor of sharing the  message with Chicago.Theresa sets out on a mission, with the paper's  encouragement, to find out who the message was written by and the story  behind it all. Using her job's resources, she tracks down the author in the  Outer Banks of North Carolina. He is Garret Blake, a terse ship-builder and  restorer whose discomfort with the world around him is alleviated only by  his passion for the sea.Kevin Costner (Blake) does well with roles that  don't require a lot of overt emotion and he does well here. Robin  Wright-Penn as Theresa was very good as the reporter who gets all too  caught up in her story. A special mention of Paul Newman here doing yeoman  character work as Blake's father Dodge, who understands his son's pain all  too well and who tries to help all around him keep their emotions in check  and headed in the right direction.The movie's downfall comes from a  meandering plot from screenwriter Gerald DiPego (&quot;Phenomenon&quot;)  and a decidedly downbeat denouement.

How wrong I was. This movie is best enjoyed on DVD for its seaborne settings more than anything - the Maine locations, doubling up for South Carolina are a joy to look at and add to the movie's many delights. But most of all, the performers are superb. Robin Wright-Penn plays Thresea, a divorcee and reporter who stumbles across a message in a green bottle addressed to one Catherine. She tracks down the sender to South Carolina - boat builder Garret Blake, played brilliantly by Kevin Costner who proves he's not typecast in action roles all the time! Blake is mourning his dead wife Catherine . . . and before you know it, time spent on his yacht and a bit of opening up his feelings brings out the romantic in both of them. But all does not run well in love as the plot takes on an interesting twist when he visits Theresa and her son in Chicago.And the ending, although a wee bit predictacle, is a real crusher, but then life has its ups and downs as well, one may say. Overall, this movie, like the also thought-provoking and brilliant WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, is one which you must watch with a wife or partner. I definitely agree with other reviews - it will make you appreciate each other a lot more and not take him or her for granted.

118321,ANHGGQT4HTEK0,0790748193,Sonia,"[7, 16]","Wow.  I have a real dilemma here.  I'm sitting here trying to figure out a way to say as delicately as possible that this movie is a real piece of crap.  I could start in on some sarcasm, because I really enjoy being sarcastic at the right moment....something like, go ahead, watch Message in a Bottle if you are on death row and have nothing better to do.  Before I get too nasty, maybe I should explain.First off, no, I didn't read the book.  Maybe that would've helped.  I think practically everyone I've ever known who read the book before seeing the movie, still said, ""The book was better.""  So, knowing that, I say the book HAS to be better because the movie was so bad.Message in a Bottle begins in a somewhat interesting fashion.  Theresa, played by Robin Wright Penn, is jogging along the beach and finds a message in a bottle.  It appears to be a love letter of sorts to a woman named Catherine.  Theresa is so intrigued with this letter that she shows the lady at the inn, her co-workers, that dog of the neighbors that bites everyone....sorry, this sarcasm just takes over my body sometimes.So, Theresa does research for a Chicago newspaper and a columnist for the paper decides to print the letter.  It's content is intriguing to everyone, so, since she found the letter, she starts researching its origin.  This is one of few things I found sort of interesting.  The methods employed in tracking down the author of the message in a bottle kept me interested.  But unfortunately, that part of the movie lasts about 5 minutes tops.  Then, I was instantly bored again.So, she tracks down the origin of the message, and goes on a mission to exploit, I mean FIND, this Ernest Hemmingway of bottled messages.  Kevin Costner, who plays Garet Blake, churns out his usual monotone performance.  Don't get me wrong.  There are some Kevin Costner movies I really like.  Honestly, I do.  But, those have been the movies where the storyline fashioned itself around his calm, everyman demeanor.  This movie moves too slowly and has too few other characters to support his usual ""no acting is good acting"" method.  Kevin, buddy, just for fun, put some emotion in your character the next time.I'm no psychologist, so I really don't know the professional theory on whether it's men or women who hold grudges longer.  I think everyone will agree no one can hold a grudge longer than a teenage girl, but I'm talking about grown men and women, and their relationships with each other.  However, talking about forgiveness, there is a really nice moment of forgiveness between two men in this film.  Like I've said before, you love those moments in movies when your heart stops, just slightly.  This is one such moment, even if every other moment stinks, this one is good.For those of you reaching, hoping for something to love, you can love Paul Newman.  He is the only reason to watch the movie, if you really feel you have to.  He plays, Dodge, Garet's grumpy, surly father.  You may be pleasantly reminded of the old codger in your life.  So, it's kind of fun to watch movie characters who remind you of someone you already know.  His role, though small, is practically the only redeeming part of this film.  There's not much more I can say regarding plot, what little there is anyway, without spoiling the movie.  I think this movie was supposed to be a chick flick, but, being a chick, I could hardly stand it.  There isn't one shred of testosterone in this movie, so for those of you who enjoy a healthy dose of that, you've been duped.  The whole movie could have been avoided if, instead of retreiving the message, the character of Theresa watches Martha Stewart and turns the bottle into a fabulous Christmas gift.  Or maybe she could skip the creative stuff and just put some liquor in there and drink herself into a stupor instead.  The plot moves along at a snail's pace and Robin Wright Penn and Kevin Costner deliver subpar performances.

118325,A35GHITTG3WX7E,0790748193,Taran Wanderer,"[0, 1]","""Message in the Bottle"" is, like the tag-line suggests, a tale of love lost and found.  The way I was introduced to this film is rather interesting, I suppose.  Many years ago I came across it when I was searching online for information regarding the 1977 classic Disney film ""The Rescuers.""  Both films share the theme of the ""message in the bottle"" so the connection lead me to this 1999 film.  Finally, I saw it for sale in a grocery store's bargain DVD bin and just had to bring it home with me, so I did.  I could not have been more pleased.  The film is touching in many ways, beautifully filmed, with fantastic characters and great acting.  It's a refreshing tale of love that does leave a bittersweet impact, and probably will not be forgotten easily.  It is also interesting that I found this film so captivating, because romance tales have never really been of interest to me.  Emily Bront's novel, ""Wuthering Heights,"" was the first time I felt interested in a story of love, enough to keep me reading, very intrigued, through its hundreds of pages.  ""Message in a Bottle"" did the same thing, it intrigued me.  The gorgeously filmed sceneries automatically appealed to me; sights of lighthouses, docks and ships, ships out at sea, ocean waves, beautiful sunsets... not to forget the message in the bottle.  To me it was like watching one of Thomas Kinkade's paintings come to life right before my eyes; the sceneries in this film are that beautiful.This is the story of a young woman named Theresa, who works for the Chicago Tribune.  She and her ex-husband had recently divorced and the two exchanged the time they would spend with their one son.  One day, during a visit to the shore, Theresa finds a simple bottle stranded on the sand and discovers inside it a message from a mysterious man addressed to a certain ""Dear Catherine.""  Theresa is touched by the profound love expressed by this person to their beloved, deceased wife, and so are her friends at work when they read it.  Theresa is not happy when her friends at the Chicago Tribune decide to publish the message in their newspaper, for she believes the person had meant the message to be personal and private.  Still, Theresa becomes intrigued with this man and longs to find him.  With a crew of investigators, she uses every clue she has, including a second and third message, to track down the author of these messages.  Her investigation leads her to a seaside town in North Carolina and a certain G. Blake.  She has high expectations of this man and quickly sets out to find him.  When she finally does, her expectations are exceeded, and she rapidly falls in love with grieving, timid Garret Blake.  She discovers the story behind his wife's death and the rivalry the event left behind for two different family's, Garret's and Catherine's.  Garret is unwilling to let go of the past and wants to conserve every memory he has of his deceased wife.  That is, until he himself slowly finds himself falling in love with Theresa.  The story then changes into one of trust, honesty and understanding, as well as a story of letting go of the past and looking forward, allowing a past life to live only in memories.  Both characters struggle within themselves to find their right paths, until the story finally changes back to one of bravery and loss.All in all, a very profound, believable and touching love story.  The characters, including Paul Newman as Dodge, Garret's father, are all strong, believable, unique and highly appealing.  They're dynamic, they change and grow in one way or another, and that applies to a number of minor characters as well.  The story feels like a classic tale of love set in modern times.  This doesn't affect the impact of the tale, however, because like I said, the sceneries in this film create on their own a sense of enchanting magic that surrounds the action and the characters.  I half-wish that some of the more adult-oriented scenes and language had been left out, thus making this film more appropriate for younger audiences.  The film is a perfect love story, refreshing and unique, and why should we not be allowed to experience it when we're younger?  Again, this film is beautiful and I'm delighted to have it in my collection.  I must say I was shocked at the number of negative reviews this film has received, ranging from bad to mediocre.  I guess in the age of dumb comedy and pessimistic disaster films, people are just not yet ready to experience a well told story of life.  I never, or very rarely, let others' opinions on a film alter my own views on it, so I give this film nine stars out of ten, which in my book, is excellent!",5,Ocean waves and gorgeous sceneries surround this unique and refreshing love story...,1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,4660,"['Message', 'Bottle', 'tag-line', 'suggests', 'tale', 'love', 'lost', 'found', 'way', 'was', 'introduced', 'film', 'rather', 'interesting', 'suppose', 'Many', 'years', 'ago', 'came', 'when', 'was', 'searching', 'online', 'information', 'regarding', '1977', 'classic', 'Disney', 'film', 'Rescuers', 'films', 'share', 'theme', 'message', 'bottle', 'connection', 'lead', '1999', 'film', 'Finally', 'saw', 'sale', 'grocery', 'store', 'bargain', 'DVD', 'bin', 'just', 'had', 'bring', 'home', 'so', 'did', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'pleased', 'film', 'touching', 'many', 'ways', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'great', 'acting', 'refreshing', 'tale', 'love', 'leave', 'bittersweet', 'impact', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'easily', 'also', 'interesting', 'found', 'film', 'so', 'captivating', 'romance', 'tales', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'interest', 'Emily', 'Bront', 'novel', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'felt', 'interested', 'story', 'love', 'enough', 'keep', 'reading', 'very', 'intrigued', 'hundreds', 'pages', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'intrigued', 'gorgeously', 'filmed', 'sceneries', 'automatically', 'appealed', 'sights', 'lighthouses', 'docks', 'ships', 'ships', 'out', 'sea', 'ocean', 'waves', 'beautiful', 'sunsets', 'not', 'forget', 'message', 'bottle', 'was', 'watching', 'one', 'Thomas', 'Kinkade', 'paintings', 'come', 'life', 'right', 'eyes', 'sceneries', 'film', 'are', 'beautiful.This', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Theresa', 'who', 'Chicago', 'Tribune', 'ex-husband', 'had', 'recently', 'divorced', 'two', 'exchanged', 'time', 'would', 'spend', 'one', 'son', 'One', 'day', 'visit', 'shore', 'Theresa', 'simple', 'bottle', 'stranded', 'sand', 'discovers', 'message', 'mysterious', 'man', 'addressed', 'certain', 'Dear', 'Catherine', 'Theresa', 'touched', 'profound', 'love', 'expressed', 'person', 'beloved', 'deceased', 'wife', 'so', 'are', 'friends', 'work', 'when', 'read', 'Theresa', 'not', 'happy', 'when', 'friends', 'Chicago', 'Tribune', 'decide', 'publish', 'message', 'newspaper', 'person', 'had', 'meant', 'message', 'be', 'personal', 'private', 'Still', 'Theresa', 'intrigued', 'man', 'longs', 'find', 'crew', 'investigators', 'clue', 'including', 'second', 'third', 'message', 'track', 'down', 'author', 'messages', 'investigation', 'seaside', 'town', 'North', 'Carolina', 'certain', 'G.', 'Blake', 'high', 'expectations', 'man', 'quickly', 'sets', 'out', 'find', 'When', 'finally', 'expectations', 'are', 'exceeded', 'rapidly', 'love', 'grieving', 'timid', 'Garret', 'Blake', 'story', 'wife', 'death', 'rivalry', 'event', 'left', 'behind', 'two', 'different', 'family', 'Garret', 'Catherine', 'Garret', 'unwilling', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'conserve', 'memory', 'deceased', 'wife', 'slowly', 'falling', 'love', 'Theresa', 'story', 'then', 'one', 'trust', 'honesty', 'understanding', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'letting', 'go', 'past', 'looking', 'forward', 'allowing', 'past', 'life', 'live', 'only', 'memories', 'characters', 'struggle', 'find', 'right', 'paths', 'story', 'finally', 'back', 'one', 'bravery', 'loss.All', 'very', 'profound', 'believable', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'characters', 'including', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Dodge', 'Garret', 'father', 'are', 'strong', 'believable', 'unique', 'highly', 'appealing', ""'re"", 'dynamic', 'change', 'grow', 'one', 'way', 'applies', 'number', 'minor', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'feels', 'classic', 'tale', 'love', 'set', 'modern', 'times', ""n't"", 'affect', 'impact', 'tale', 'however', 'said', 'sceneries', 'film', 'create', 'own', 'sense', 'enchanting', 'magic', 'action', 'characters', 'half-wish', 'more', 'adult-oriented', 'scenes', 'language', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'thus', 'making', 'film', 'more', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'audiences', 'film', 'perfect', 'love', 'story', 'refreshing', 'unique', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'experience', 'when', ""'re"", 'younger', 'Again', 'film', 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'delighted', 'have', 'collection', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'shocked', 'number', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'received', 'ranging', 'bad', 'mediocre', 'guess', 'age', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'pessimistic', 'disaster', 'films', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'yet', 'ready', 'experience', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'life', 'never', 'very', 'rarely', 'let', 'others', 'opinions', 'film', 'alter', 'own', 'views', 'so', 'give', 'film', 'nine', 'ten', 'book', 'excellent']",Message in a Bottle VHS

Kevin Costner is the guy, and the reporter is Robin Wright . . . both suitable for their roles, but nothing remarkable here. Paul Newman is passable as the sailor's father . . . and the screenplay, which slowly withers, resorts to a death at sea.

It may be that it is just too gussied up -- everything about it is picture postcardy and needed more roughness to really work.  It is all too beautiful. It swoops and swirls and the music swells and the sea is photogenic, and the viewer is distanced from the story accordingly.  Nevertheless, and in spite of what I just said, the best thing about it by far is Robin Wright Penn, who is completely gorgeous, and in one or two scenes is quite funny and charming (she needs way more of this kind of work). Kevin Costner has a pretty thankless task, and he gets no thanks -- he's dull, dull, dull.  His beach house is way sexier than he is -- many would kill for his house. The sex scenes between the two of them are not sexy:  there are two nice little scenes, one in a hotel, and one at her house in Chicago that suggest that something really human could have been made of their romance -- meanwhile the overt romance scenes are hopelessly dreary and contrived -- cuddling by a fire,  cute dumpings in the water, etc, etc, etc.  Please. The complicating factor in all this is that Paul Newman plays his father, and is far sexier than Costner.  The director obviously worried about this, so he deliberately put in a scene where Newman says how old he is, and that if he were a hundred years younger she would be in trouble.  In spite of this, there is a moment when one thinks that Paul and Robin should get together, now that the son is drowned.....There is a mythological undercurrent to the story which also makes one suspect that the sweet young first wife drowns her husband for taking up with another woman.  At least it is lovely to think so.",2,bottled up,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,1754,"['completely', 'slushy', 'movie', 'ought', 'be', 'better', 'ingredients', 'short', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'too', 'gussied', 'up', 'everything', 'picture', 'postcardy', 'needed', 'more', 'roughness', 'really', 'work', 'too', 'beautiful', 'swirls', 'music', 'swells', 'sea', 'photogenic', 'viewer', 'distanced', 'story', 'accordingly', 'Nevertheless', 'spite', 'what', 'just', 'said', 'best', 'thing', 'far', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'who', 'completely', 'gorgeous', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'quite', 'funny', 'charming', 'way', 'more', 'kind', 'work', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'pretty', 'thankless', 'task', 'thanks', 'dull', 'dull', 'dull', 'beach', 'house', 'way', 'sexier', 'many', 'would', 'kill', 'house', 'sex', 'scenes', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'sexy', 'are', 'two', 'nice', 'little', 'scenes', 'one', 'hotel', 'one', 'house', 'Chicago', 'suggest', 'something', 'really', 'human', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'romance', 'overt', 'romance', 'scenes', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'dreary', 'contrived', 'cuddling', 'fire', 'cute', 'dumpings', 'water', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'Please', 'complicating', 'factor', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'father', 'far', 'sexier', 'Costner', 'director', 'obviously', 'worried', 'deliberately', 'put', 'scene', 'where', 'Newman', 'how', 'old', 'were', 'hundred', 'years', 'younger', 'would', 'be', 'trouble', 'spite', 'moment', 'when', 'one', 'Paul', 'Robin', 'should', 'get', 'together', 'now', 'son', 'drowned', 'mythological', 'undercurrent', 'story', 'also', 'one', 'suspect', 'sweet', 'young', 'first', 'wife', 'husband', 'taking', 'up', 'woman', 'least', 'lovely', 'think', 'so']",Message in a Bottle VHS

It stars Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman.  The story begins when Theresa Osborne is jogging on the beach in Cape Cod and finds a corked bottle half buried in the sand with a rolled up note inside of it.  She takes the piece of paper out of the bottle and discovers that it's a love letter written to someone named Catherine.  Divorced and raising a son on her on, the letter touches something in Theresa's heart that's totally unexpected.  She returns home to Chicago and to her job at the Chicago Tribune, where she works as a researcher.  Theresa decides to share the letter with her friends at work and an article is written about the letter.  This results in a ton of responses from the female readers of the newspaper.  Two more discovered letters are eventually added to the one Theresa has, and she begins a search to find out who the author of the letters is.  This leads her on a journey to the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Garrett Blake, a boat builder.  Garrett lost his wife two years earlier to an illness and has never recovered.  He still loves her and has kept their house the same since her death, refusing to allow her memory to fade.  When Theresa Osborne enters his life, however, Garrett begins to believe that it might be possible to love again.Message In a Bottle is a beautiful film with magnificent shots of the Outer Banks (though most of the movie was filmed on the coast of Maine) and powerful performances by Costner, Penn, Newman, and John Savage.  Though the movie has a tragic ending, its message is still poignant in that it's possible to love again, even after you've lost someone close to you.  Oh, boy, is the ending of the movie a real tearjerker.  This is another 10-rating on the ""Boohoo Scale.""  The music to the film by Gabriel Yared is lovely and heart moving, and you may want to buy the soundtrack after listening to it.  Nicholas Sparks' Message In a Bottle is a great romantic novel and a wonderful movie about love that will have the eyes of most viewers brimming over with tears.
