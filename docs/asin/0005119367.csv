111,A36311XF4O81IK,0005119367,A. J. Trivette,"[4, 4]","This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level! I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  ""Hollywoodized"" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one!

112,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,0005119367,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[102, 106]","Though this interpretation of Joseph's life has been substantially embellished, the heart and soul of the story remain intact, and is ultimately quite faithful to the Biblical account covered in Genesis Ch. 33:18 through Ch. 46:30.Much of the acting is marvelous, especially Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, whose part has thankfully been enlarged, because he is riveting in every scene he is in.Martin Landau is also excellent as the patriarch Jacob, who mourns the apparent loss of his favorite son, Joseph.Australian actor/dancer Paul Mercurio (&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;) is good in the lead, and others in the cast include Leslie Ann Warren as Potiphar's lying wife, the always beautiful Dominique Sanda as Leah, and some fine character actors playing Joseph's brothers, notably Michael Attwell (Judah), and Vincenzo Nicoli (Simeon).Included in this film, and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah, and the horrific tale his sister Dinah, both done effectively.The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting, they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama. Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who &quot;does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death&quot; is worth watching again and again.",5,a man of character and faith,1077321600,"02 21, 2004",2004,1900,"['interpretation', 'Joseph', 'life', 'been', 'substantially', 'embellished', 'heart', 'soul', 'story', 'remain', 'intact', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'faithful', 'Biblical', 'account', 'covered', 'Genesis', 'Ch', '33:18', 'Ch', '46:30.Much', 'acting', 'marvelous', 'especially', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Potiphar', 'part', 'thankfully', 'been', 'enlarged', 'riveting', 'scene', 'in.Martin', 'Landau', 'also', 'excellent', 'patriarch', 'Jacob', 'who', 'apparent', 'loss', 'favorite', 'son', 'Joseph.Australian', 'actor/dancer', 'Paul', 'Mercurio', 'quot', 'Strictly', 'Ballroom', 'quot', 'good', 'lead', 'others', 'cast', 'include', 'Leslie', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Potiphar', 'lying', 'wife', 'always', 'beautiful', 'Dominique', 'Sanda', 'Leah', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'playing', 'Joseph', 'brothers', 'notably', 'Michael', 'Attwell', 'Judah', 'Vincenzo', 'Nicoli', 'Simeon', '.Included', 'film', 'intrinsic', 'Joseph', 'life', 'are', 'stories', 'Tamar', 'Judah', 'horrific', 'tale', 'sister', 'Dinah', 'done', 'effectively.The', 'only', 'parts', 'are', 'less', 'first-rate', 'are', 'scenes', 'Pharoah', 'court', 'almost', 'campy', 'costuming', 'acting', 'can', 'provide', 'amusement', 'midst', 'drama', 'Stefano', 'Dionisi', 'most', 'unlikely', 'modern', 'looking', 'Pharoah', 'ultimate', 'babe', 'wife', 'pulchritudinous', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'entire', 'film', 'always', 'mentally', 'visually', 'entertaining', 'much', 'spiritual', 'content', 'so', 'much', 'Old', 'Testament', 'are', 'allegories', 'run', 'narrative', 'point', 'New', 'Testament', 'story', 'Joseph', 'much', 'symbolism.Filmed', 'Quarzazate', 'Morocco', 'exotic', 'ancient', 'structures', 'landscapes', 'cinematography', 'Rafaele', 'Mertes', 'wonderful', 'way', 'average', 'production', 'television', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'quot', 'nothing', 'conscience', 'even', 'pain', 'death', 'quot', 'watching', 'again', 'again']",Joseph VHS

124,ADES8B01WRPI3,0005119367,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[7, 7]","This movie, JOSEPH, is in-depth and interesting. They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren't usually included in the story of Joseph, but they don't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes, so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar, so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture, though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor's role. But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not. I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph. I never thought of that aspect, and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph, but it makes sense, after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed, especially as a youngster. I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant, spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery. It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah, Joseph's brother, from Genesis 38, which surprised me. Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph's brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah's baker and waiter is interesting, in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD. It is 3 hours long, so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend, starring Maritn Landau as Abraham, with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, called IN THE BEGINNING, which is also very good. It, too, covers the story of Joseph in a faster, more condensed version. IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events, but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT, the cable TV channel, under the subheading ""The Bible Collection."" I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well. Actually, TNT is just releasing the DVD versions. I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990's. There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years, of these LUBE movies. Look for ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON, as well. These three come in a money-saving collection called THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, which is well worth the price.",5,Great Telling of the Story of Joseph!

This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (""Blessed be His name"")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.

Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....""slightly"" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the ""edit"" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to ""leaven the whole loaf"" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the ""Sampson"" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it!

I teach ancient history and civilizations, and have an earned doctorate in theology. I say this only to lend perspective to this review.This film is Biblically accurate, well-acted, and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch!Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young, this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say!Kingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show, and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph. Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon.Having watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's &quot;My God, my God...&quot; speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story.When Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears.As my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society.'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.Everyone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph.

169,AUFK6UT2DU87H,0005119367,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[2, 2]","There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  ""Joseph"" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  ""Joseph"" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.",5,Magnificent!

First, it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say &quot;brava&quot; to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally, the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However, my &quot;four star&quot; rating refers to the &quot;flashback&quot; section of the film.  Yes, why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?

If only the leaders of the world today was like Joseph was, a wise man, who listened to God, and kept the Ten Commandments!Please read God's story of Joseph, thats in the book of Geneis, in the Holy Bible first, so that you can know Gods true account of Joseph firsthand! This is a awesome, and remarkable true story, of so long ago!My favorite part of the movie, is when Joseph meets the Pharoah of Egypt face to face! WOW! This movie was very well done, this movie is one of my favorite versions of Joseph! God blessed Joseph greatly, and had big plans for him all along, for living his life as a godly man! I loved the way Joseph, and his Egyption master(Ben Kingsley), became friends, and earned each others trust and respect, eventhough Joseph was still a slave.It always amazed me, how Joseph was able to forgive his brothers, especially after what they did to him! Joseph was a very wise, and brillant man! I highly recommend this movie, it is based on a very true, and awesome story, thats in the HOLY BIBLE! This movie is very good, and I loved it very much!

193,A6QOECTD2CPH6,0005119367,The Golden Child,"[3, 6]","Overall, I enjoyed this movie, espescially its ending. The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her ""please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear."" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the ""prostitute"" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.To the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very ""PG-13"" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his ""lover,"" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me). Christianity focuses on the heart before appearances so lets all appreciate this great adaptation of Joseph's life.

194,A37A44LEGU3T45,0005119367,Todd Hudnall,"[5, 5]","""Joseph"" masterfully brings the pages of Genesis alive with the same grit, power, and passion of the Biblical narrative. The acting is of the highest quality, being highlighted by Ben Kingsley's brilliant portrayal of Potiphar. Despite some Hollywood license, ""Joseph"" remains true to the Biblical narrative, even including the sorted accounts involving Tamar and Dinah (which should mark the movie with a PG rating). It is an epic motion picture, lasting over 3 hours, but there is nothing I would have been left on the editing room floor. ""Joseph"" does have its weaknesses, yet the movie receives my very highest recommendation. In fact, it is so good, I consider it one of my all-time cinematic favorites.

195,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,0005119367,Utah Blaine,"[5, 5]","This film is a recounting of the Genesis tale of Joseph.  Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film.",5,Superb dramatization of the Old Testament story of Joseph,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1493,"['film', 'recounting', 'Genesis', 'tale', 'Joseph', 'Joseph', 'most', 'loved', 'son', 'father', 'gift', 'prophecy', 'older', 'brothers', 'hate', 'sell', 'slavery', 'Joseph', 'up', 'Egypt', 'where', 'eventually', 'second', 'most', 'powerful', 'man', 'kingdom', 'Pharoah', 'famine', 'Joseph', 'brothers', 'come', 'Egypt', 'begging', 'grain', 'not', 'knowing', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'decide', 'fate', 'brother', 'whom', 'believe', 'be', 'dead', 'one', 'series', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'important', 'figures', 'Old', 'Testament', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'reviewed', 'several', 'other', 'stories', 'series', 'best', 'strong', 'series', 'view', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'found', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Joseph', 'brothers', 'be', 'particularly', 'moving', 'well', 'done', 'many', 'films', 'series', 'story', 'faith', 'perserverance', 'writer', 'producer', 'did', 'particularly', 'good', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'story', 'Joseph', 'Genesis', 'adding', 'lots', 'non-Biblical', 'threads', 'One', 'thing', 'like', 'movie', 'series', 'whole', 'are', 'not', 'overdone', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'effects-laden', 'films', 'casts', 'thousands', 'rely', 'writing', 'good', 'acting', 'convey', 'tale', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'realistic', 'give', 'film', 'Biblical', 'feel', 'being', 'ostentatious', 'bottom', 'line', 'opinion', 'way', 'Bible', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'film']",Joseph VHS
