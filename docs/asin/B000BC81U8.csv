939972,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000BC81U8,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[1, 10]","In a film that is essentially a bunch of kids playing ping pong the makers of the aptly named ""Ping Pong"" have gotten a fair amount of worldwide exposure mainly because of the unique topic. Since we Yanks don't care about the particular sport Hollywood won't touch it. But Japan is on the other side of the world and have taken a been there sports pic into a rising sun blockbuster. For me the film is a monstrous whiff, the victim of over editing and a director incapable of telling a proper story. Sure, many of the charms may have been lost in translation. It stocks up on the bizarro Asian humor that is so reliant on over exaggeration and way too much enthusiasm. Also, the general fanaticism over ping pong may not compute in your American brain. Seriously, who plays table tennis anymore? And what do you do with yourself if you happen to have the talent for it?The main players are Peco and Smile. Smile is your typical sad sack. The type who thinks that frowning makes him profound, a goth minus the black, you know the type. He spends much of the film in a state of melancholy hand-wringing as he whine whines about how ping pong is nothing more than ""killing time."" Maybe so, but then he's just a darn good time killer, because he definitely has the talent. After an ego caused loss a hard nosed coach gets a hold of him and pushes him to the brink of superstardom. I also must mention that he is constantly fiddling with a Rubics Cube, and ever since Chris Gardner used his to get him a seat at the white table it has becomes shorthand for ""Must be a genius."" Meanwhile, Peco drops out of the sport for a while and becomes a skirt chasing, potato chip munching layabout. That is until his granny becomes his new trainer and together they train for the next big tournament. Why training montages are so popular is beyond me. They practice, they get better, we get it. Obviously this is all leading up to the Big Tournament and if you don't know who ends up in the finals together than I don't know what to tell you.My main beef though is the scatterbrained editing that whips this film into one fine mess. There is no ""let the action tell the story"" here, rather director Fumihiko Sori overcooks all the ping pong sequences with zoom ins, slow mos, and extreme close ups. Not one point can transpire without him trying to remind us what a genius he is. I just wanted him to put his stupid camera on a tripod and let me watch the game. He does get a few good shots out of the deal, but to him more is always more. Even his opening shot of a boy jumping off a bridge is cool, but ends up destroying itself because he takes it so far than you realize that he was in cahoots with a computer the whole time. I'm sure he wanted this to be ""The Matrix,"" but it ends up a phony, an ""Equilibrium"" if you will. It does generate an energy, but it is not a positive one. Less editing would have made a world of difference, but I'm sure he is not going to listen to me. No doubt Sori will launch his career off of this film so it looks like I'm the real loser in this situation. **",2,Extreme Editing Run Amok,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,3079,"['film', 'essentially', 'bunch', 'kids', 'playing', 'ping', 'makers', 'aptly', 'named', 'Ping', 'Pong', 'have', 'gotten', 'fair', 'amount', 'worldwide', 'exposure', 'mainly', 'unique', 'topic', 'Yanks', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'particular', 'sport', 'Hollywood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'touch', 'Japan', 'other', 'side', 'world', 'have', 'taken', 'been', 'sports', 'pic', 'rising', 'sun', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'monstrous', 'whiff', 'victim', 'editing', 'director', 'incapable', 'telling', 'proper', 'story', 'Sure', 'many', 'charms', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'translation', 'stocks', 'up', 'bizarro', 'Asian', 'humor', 'so', 'reliant', 'exaggeration', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'Also', 'general', 'fanaticism', 'ping', 'pong', 'may', 'not', 'compute', 'American', 'brain', 'Seriously', 'who', 'table', 'tennis', 'anymore', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'happen', 'have', 'talent', 'main', 'players', 'are', 'Peco', 'Smile', 'Smile', 'typical', 'sad', 'sack', 'type', 'who', 'frowning', 'profound', 'goth', 'black', 'know', 'type', 'much', 'film', 'state', 'melancholy', 'hand-wringing', 'whines', 'how', 'ping', 'pong', 'nothing', 'more', 'killing', 'time', 'Maybe', 'so', 'then', 'just', 'darn', 'good', 'time', 'killer', 'definitely', 'talent', 'ego', 'caused', 'loss', 'hard', 'nosed', 'coach', 'hold', 'brink', 'superstardom', 'also', 'must', 'mention', 'constantly', 'fiddling', 'Rubics', 'Cube', 'ever', 'Chris', 'Gardner', 'used', 'get', 'seat', 'white', 'table', 'becomes', 'shorthand', 'Must', 'be', 'genius', 'Meanwhile', 'Peco', 'sport', 'while', 'skirt', 'chasing', 'potato', 'chip', 'munching', 'layabout', 'granny', 'new', 'trainer', 'together', 'train', 'next', 'big', 'tournament', 'Why', 'training', 'montages', 'are', 'so', 'popular', 'practice', 'get', 'better', 'get', 'Obviously', 'leading', 'up', 'Big', 'Tournament', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'up', 'finals', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'tell', 'you.My', 'main', 'beef', 'though', 'scatterbrained', 'editing', 'film', 'one', 'fine', 'mess', 'let', 'action', 'tell', 'story', 'here', 'rather', 'director', 'Fumihiko', 'Sori', 'ping', 'pong', 'sequences', 'zoom', 'ins', 'slow', 'mos', 'extreme', 'close', 'ups', 'Not', 'one', 'point', 'can', 'transpire', 'trying', 'remind', 'what', 'genius', 'just', 'wanted', 'put', 'stupid', 'camera', 'tripod', 'let', 'watch', 'game', 'get', 'few', 'good', 'shots', 'deal', 'more', 'always', 'more', 'Even', 'opening', 'shot', 'boy', 'jumping', 'off', 'bridge', 'cool', 'up', 'destroying', 'so', 'far', 'realize', 'was', 'cahoots', 'computer', 'whole', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wanted', 'be', 'Matrix', 'up', 'phony', 'Equilibrium', 'will', 'generate', 'energy', 'not', 'positive', 'one', 'editing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'world', 'difference', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'going', 'listen', 'doubt', 'Sori', 'will', 'launch', 'career', 'film', ""'m"", 'real', 'loser', 'situation', '**']",N/A
939973,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000BC81U8,Ernest Jagger,"[0, 0]","Based on a manga, ""Ping Pong,"" is a good Japanese film that children, or young teens can view; unfortunately this film is not available at the present time as a Region 1 DVD; however, if you have a multi-region player this film is highly recommended. I purchased this film at local Asian video outlet, who were able to get it through Australia. There are too many good Japanese films that are not marketed in the U.S., and this is one of many. I purchased this film a couple of years ago, and hopefully someday it will be more accessible. The film itself centers on the competitive world of High School Ping Pong in Japan. However, there is more to the story than Ping Pong. The films main protagonists are Peco (Yosuke Kubozuka) and Smile (Arata). They have both been friends since childhood.Peco is an arrogant and brash player who believes in taunting and crushing his opponents he plays against; and then rubbing their faces in it afterwards. Smile, [who gets his nickname because he never smiles] is actually a better player, but intentionally loses to other players, and especially his friend Peco, out of loyalty: And also because he really does not care about winning. [Which irritates the coach]. The coach, Butterfly Joe is aptly portrayed by actor (Naoto Takenaka), who gave a great performance in the film ""Shall We Dansu"". This film is both a comedy and drama in one. I like the way the films narrative shows flashbacks of Smile remembering a young Peco with the mask of a popular manga hero during their childhood, while proclaiming, ""Enter the hero."" We see that Smile has worshiped his friend Peco as a hero since childhood.However, things are about to change when both of them are defeated during an inter-school competition. Director Fumihiko Sori did and excellent job with character development in this film. I was not sure that I would like this film at first, but it was recommended to me by a friend whose child was in the same Japanese Language Immersion Class my daughter was in at the time; and I have liked ALL of his recommendations. So, I decided to purchase the film before ever watching it [I do this a lot], and it was well worth the purchase.The films narrative of the friendship between Peco and Smile on the Ping Pong team was absolutely terrific. The director chose the rights actors, who pull off great nuances in their respective roles. Peco as the brash player, and Smile as his nerdy and awkward friend. On one side you have Peco who wants to be nothing less than the champ, all the while thinking highly of himself. And on the opposite end you have Smile, who is just content to play for fun, all the while allowing his friend to defeat him. However, when Peco discovers that Smile loses to him on purpose, he is crushed.Moreover, the entire cast of characters in the film are great: From ""Dragon"" (Shido Nakamura) who is from a highly disciplined and militaristic school who winds up defeating Peco. And ""China, (Sam Lee) who defeats Smile. As a result, these two friends, Peco and Smile decide to pick themselves up and become better players, while also mending their friendship with each other. There are moments the film does drag, but not too much. Furthermore, the payoff at the end of the film is well worth the time. Also, there are some very funny parts in this film. I didn't think I would like a Ping Pong film, but this film is more than that. It is a really good film, and highly recommended. Plus, it has a great soundtrack! And once again, it is recommended for children, or young teens.

The individual's drive to be the best is presented in this film well, and the character of Smile introduces a rarely seen character model for this genre: the reluctant star.As mentioned in other reviews, the film also has a deep undercurrent of what it means to be a friend, and a hero to those you love most. The erratic Peco and the reserved Smile are the perfect definition of the similarities opposites can have. Smile waits for the Peco he idolizes to rise above his own shadowy arrogance and bring him out of the despair he feels, while Peco wrestles with a need for a hero of his own, and coming to terms with the fact that it is not a bad thing to need a helping hand. The depth of the emotional story is wholly unexpected going into the film, but by the end of it one feels as if one has witnessed a new type of emotion, a new way to be a friend.Fumihiko Sori soars with this film, his first--it is not a surprise that he was nominated for Best Director at the Japanese Academy Awards because of it. He certainly knows how to work his way around an action scene, and there are three or four scenes that are so artistically innovative they overshadow many aspects of the film and leave the viewer awestruck.It is a sad thing that more people in the English-speaking world have not had a chance to enjoy this film. It is without a doubt a shining example of modern Japanese cinema. While the character's drive to success is not as strongly presented in this film as in other Japanese stories, like Hikaru no Go, Hajime no Ippo or Prince of Tennis, the depth of emotion presented and the amazing directorial approach work together to make this a film worth owning.",4,Amazing directer and emotional depth,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1805,"['manga', 'anime', 'literature', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'Japanese', 'art', 'undeniably', 'better', 'other', 'country', 'sports', 'story', 'individual', 'drive', 'be', 'best', 'presented', 'film', 'well', 'character', 'Smile', 'rarely', 'seen', 'character', 'model', 'genre', 'reluctant', 'star.As', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'also', 'deep', 'undercurrent', 'what', 'be', 'friend', 'hero', 'love', 'most', 'erratic', 'Peco', 'reserved', 'Smile', 'are', 'perfect', 'definition', 'similarities', 'opposites', 'can', 'have', 'Smile', 'Peco', 'rise', 'own', 'shadowy', 'arrogance', 'bring', 'despair', 'Peco', 'need', 'hero', 'own', 'coming', 'terms', 'fact', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'need', 'helping', 'hand', 'depth', 'emotional', 'story', 'wholly', 'unexpected', 'going', 'film', 'end', 'one', 'one', 'witnessed', 'new', 'type', 'emotion', 'new', 'way', 'be', 'friend.Fumihiko', 'Sori', 'film', 'first', 'not', 'surprise', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'Japanese', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'certainly', 'how', 'work', 'way', 'action', 'scene', 'are', 'three', 'four', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'artistically', 'innovative', 'overshadow', 'many', 'aspects', 'film', 'leave', 'viewer', 'awestruck.It', 'sad', 'thing', 'more', 'people', 'English-speaking', 'world', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'film', 'doubt', 'shining', 'example', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'character', 'drive', 'success', 'not', 'strongly', 'presented', 'film', 'other', 'Japanese', 'stories', 'Hikaru', 'Go', 'Hajime', 'Ippo', 'Prince', 'Tennis', 'depth', 'emotion', 'presented', 'amazing', 'directorial', 'approach', 'work', 'together', 'make', 'film', 'owning']",N/A

The common bond is the childhood friendship that continues into adulthood, galvanised and tested by a passion for ping-pong (table tennis). This is not `pitter-patter' table tennis. This is the real thing. As the film progresses, there are more and more playing sequences and reflections by the players; about themselves (the introverted stuff) and about their opponents (harsh sentiment at times). The point is that all have a passion for a passionate game (and for those of us who have played it seriously, we understand that notion). Peco is the precociously brilliant, extrovert player. Tsukimoto is his boyhood friend; the introspective player. Peco plays with aggressive and flamboyant 'top-spin'. Tsukimoto plays defensively, chopping each shot with heavy 'back-spin'. The increasingly prolonged playing sequences are poetic to watch. The film reaches a perfect crescendo, when these two meet in the final of a tournament.

Smile never smiles and seemed destined to be an outcast until the cocky young ping pong player Paco took him under his wing and taught him to play.  After that they were inseparable, and the only hang up is that Smile has the greater talent, and holds back in order to let Paco win.  Everyone can see this except for them.  What struck me most about the film is that it is distinctively Japanese -- that this is not a film designed for export but that makes it all the more refreshing and revelatory -- and as a sports film doesn't fall prey to any (or many) of the cliches that are part of the American sports film genre.  There is of course the obligatory ""rising to the challenge"" montage -- when the two main characters take their sport seriously and we see them being pushed through a series of exercises by their coaches -- but even that felt distinctive and amusing.

While on one hand a spectacularly visual sports film, with super-speed ping pong matches and dynamic characters, it is also a deeply introspective look at friendship, and the role of a hero and what that is supposed to mean.Based on a five-volume manga by Matsumoto Taiyo, ""Ping Pong"" is the story of two best friends and their love of the sport of Ping Pong. Nicknamed ""Peco"" and ""Smile,"" they are a study of contrasts. Peco (the popular Kubozuka Yosuke from ""Go"") is brash, flashy and smug, always taunting his opponents and singing his own praises as the best player around. Smile, given the name because he never smiles, is a quiet, self-effacing boy whose calm demeanour is the absolute opposite of Peco. Since childhood, they have practiced at a local hangout run by Obaba/Granny (Natsuki Mari from ""Samurai Fiction"") who has trained and nurtured the kids character and talent. Now in high school, they are on the ping pong team coached by former champion ""Butterfly Joe"" (played by the always great Takenaka Naoto.) Peco is Smile's hero, and the natural order of their friendship has been maintained for years. There is only one problem. Smile is better than Peco, and has been purposely loosing to him so as not to topple his hero. Smile prefers to be second place, in deference to his skills. This revelation crushes Peco, and he must discover his own actual strength, and learn what it means to be a hero.Into this mix are an amazing cast of characters each with a unique name and personality. ""Dragon,"" the harsh and serious leader of a rival school, who cannot stand Peco's humor and silliness while playing. ""Akuma"" (""Devil"") who tries to live up to Dragon's standards, but must recognize his own weaknesses. ""China,"" a Chinese player, is the neutral voice who is able to stand aside and see the inner struggles played out before him.Much more than just a sports film, or an uplifting ""feel good"" flick, it is amazing that ""Ping Pong"" is so-far the only film from director Sori Fumihiko. Sori is a computer graphics expert by trade, and the use of CGI is almost seamless, as the players play a game with no ball which was later added in. The actors are all dedicated to there role, and show a profound depth. Takenaka Naoto (""Butterfly Joe"") is both his usual clownish self, as well as someone with a hidden melancholy from a secret past.It does drag a bit in the middle, and sometimes you wonder when the payoff is going to come. When it does come, however, it is not exactly what you expected, and better than you imagined.""He is playing against someone who is playing for the sheer fun of it. To face such an opponent is...fantastic.""",5,Enter the Hero!,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,2810,"['film', 'just', 'great', 'easily', 'one', 'favorite', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'flicks', 'show', 'best', 'countries', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'readily', 'exported', 'one', 'hand', 'spectacularly', 'visual', 'sports', 'film', 'super-speed', 'ping', 'pong', 'matches', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'also', 'deeply', 'introspective', 'look', 'friendship', 'role', 'hero', 'what', 'supposed', 'mean.Based', 'five-volume', 'manga', 'Matsumoto', 'Taiyo', 'Ping', 'Pong', 'story', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'love', 'sport', 'Ping', 'Pong', 'Nicknamed', 'Peco', 'Smile', 'are', 'study', 'contrasts', 'Peco', 'popular', 'Kubozuka', 'Yosuke', 'Go', 'brash', 'flashy', 'smug', 'always', 'taunting', 'opponents', 'singing', 'own', 'praises', 'best', 'player', 'around', 'Smile', 'given', 'name', 'never', 'quiet', 'self-effacing', 'boy', 'calm', 'demeanour', 'absolute', 'opposite', 'Peco', 'childhood', 'have', 'practiced', 'local', 'hangout', 'run', 'Obaba/Granny', 'Natsuki', 'Mari', 'Samurai', 'Fiction', 'who', 'trained', 'nurtured', 'kids', 'character', 'talent', 'Now', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'ping', 'pong', 'team', 'coached', 'former', 'champion', 'Butterfly', 'Joe', 'played', 'always', 'great', 'Takenaka', 'Naoto', 'Peco', 'Smile', 'hero', 'natural', 'order', 'friendship', 'been', 'maintained', 'years', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'Smile', 'better', 'Peco', 'been', 'purposely', 'loosing', 'so', 'not', 'topple', 'hero', 'Smile', 'prefers', 'be', 'second', 'place', 'deference', 'skills', 'revelation', 'Peco', 'must', 'discover', 'own', 'actual', 'strength', 'learn', 'what', 'be', 'hero.Into', 'mix', 'are', 'amazing', 'cast', 'characters', 'unique', 'name', 'personality', 'Dragon', 'harsh', 'serious', 'leader', 'rival', 'school', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'Peco', 'humor', 'silliness', 'playing', 'Akuma', 'Devil', 'who', 'live', 'up', 'Dragon', 'standards', 'must', 'recognize', 'own', 'weaknesses', 'China', 'Chinese', 'player', 'neutral', 'voice', 'who', 'able', 'stand', 'aside', 'see', 'inner', 'struggles', 'played', 'out', 'him.Much', 'more', 'just', 'sports', 'film', 'uplifting', 'feel', 'good', 'flick', 'amazing', 'Ping', 'Pong', 'only', 'film', 'director', 'Sori', 'Fumihiko', 'Sori', 'computer', 'graphics', 'expert', 'trade', 'use', 'CGI', 'almost', 'seamless', 'players', 'play', 'game', 'ball', 'was', 'later', 'added', 'actors', 'are', 'dedicated', 'role', 'show', 'profound', 'depth', 'Takenaka', 'Naoto', 'Butterfly', 'Joe', 'usual', 'clownish', 'self', 'as', 'well', 'someone', 'hidden', 'melancholy', 'secret', 'past.It', 'drag', 'bit', 'middle', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'when', 'payoff', 'going', 'come', 'When', 'come', 'however', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'better', 'imagined', 'playing', 'someone', 'who', 'playing', 'sheer', 'fun', 'face', 'opponent', 'fantastic']",N/A
939980,A2AWDAJOV50842,B000BC81U8,"Zendicant Penguin ""Zendicant Penguin""","[2, 4]","Wow.  This movie works on many different levels, for it is all of the following: Rocky pic, modern samurai movie, chop-sockie, gunfighter flick, coming of age tale, children's story, buddy movie, and adult drama; it even has aspects of a chick flick, all under the guise of a comedy (Our closest analogue would likely be the Pixar(?) Toy Story cartoons).What makes the best Japanese movies great is their ability to capture a part of the essence of what is Japanese and communicate it universally.  For instance, in this film, during one of the samurai ping pong matches opponents are elevated to a zen-like state of consciousness.  Creating such an interlude would never occur to a western director but its zeitgeist is easily apparent from whatever angle one apprehends it.  This movie contains numerous moments where this occurs and cause you to replay them more than once.Having said that, there are quite a few things in this movie that will strike the western viewer as embarrassingly precious or slapstick.  Such moments are rife in many other Japanese films I've seen, and are likely cultural quirks much like the obligatory gratuitous breast scene of American movies.  It's easy to overlook these awkward bits in anticipation of the transcendent moments one hopes for.Reading other reviews of this movie will likely tell you what you need to know about the plot: best friends with massive ping pong talent, now in high school playing varsity playing the best from rival schools; a hired gun from China and the captain of the Jock Squad.The problem is that between our two protagonists we find one who is too big for his britches and another who couldn't care less about the game.  Neither one seems to have what it takes to win.  One from want of desire, the other from lack of will and so in a double entendre it takes a hero to make a hero.Takashi Miike fans take note that the role of coach is played by takenaka whom you'll recognize from his yakuza films.  As usual, he is great.  The performance of the can't care less ping pong protagonist is also quite brilliant, as are the film choreography and soundtrack.I had to laugh when I read the one star criticism issuing from what is obviously a ping pong player because I admit I was totally convinced that everybody in the film could play even though I knew that some of the shots were impossible and much of the play was choreographed.Anyway, if it has never occurred to you that a ping pong table can be turned into the OK Corral, you should probably watch this movie.  You'll be amazed.",5,This is the movie Rocky wanted to make!,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,2553,"['Wow', 'movie', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'following', 'Rocky', 'pic', 'modern', 'samurai', 'movie', 'chop-sockie', 'gunfighter', 'flick', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'children', 'story', 'buddy', 'movie', 'adult', 'drama', 'even', 'aspects', 'chick', 'flick', 'guise', 'comedy', 'closest', 'analogue', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'Pixar', 'Toy', 'Story', 'cartoons', 'best', 'Japanese', 'movies', 'great', 'ability', 'capture', 'part', 'essence', 'what', 'Japanese', 'communicate', 'universally', 'instance', 'film', 'one', 'samurai', 'ping', 'pong', 'matches', 'opponents', 'are', 'elevated', 'zen-like', 'state', 'consciousness', 'Creating', 'such', 'interlude', 'would', 'never', 'occur', 'western', 'director', 'zeitgeist', 'easily', 'apparent', 'angle', 'one', 'movie', 'numerous', 'moments', 'where', 'cause', 'replay', 'more', 'once.Having', 'said', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'will', 'strike', 'western', 'viewer', 'embarrassingly', 'precious', 'slapstick', 'Such', 'moments', 'are', 'rife', 'many', 'other', 'Japanese', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'likely', 'cultural', 'quirks', 'much', 'obligatory', 'gratuitous', 'breast', 'scene', 'American', 'movies', 'easy', 'overlook', 'awkward', 'bits', 'anticipation', 'transcendent', 'one', 'for.Reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'tell', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'plot', 'best', 'friends', 'massive', 'ping', 'pong', 'talent', 'now', 'high', 'school', 'playing', 'varsity', 'playing', 'best', 'rival', 'schools', 'hired', 'gun', 'China', 'captain', 'Jock', 'Squad.The', 'problem', 'two', 'protagonists', 'find', 'one', 'who', 'too', 'big', 'britches', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'game', 'one', 'have', 'what', 'win', 'One', 'want', 'desire', 'other', 'lack', 'will', 'so', 'double', 'entendre', 'hero', 'make', 'hero.Takashi', 'Miike', 'fans', 'take', 'note', 'role', 'coach', 'played', 'takenaka', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'yakuza', 'films', 'usual', 'great', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'ping', 'pong', 'protagonist', 'also', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'are', 'film', 'choreography', 'soundtrack.I', 'had', 'when', 'read', 'one', 'star', 'criticism', 'issuing', 'what', 'obviously', 'ping', 'pong', 'player', 'admit', 'was', 'totally', 'convinced', 'everybody', 'film', 'could', 'play', 'even', 'knew', 'shots', 'were', 'impossible', 'much', 'play', 'was', 'choreographed.Anyway', 'never', 'occurred', 'ping', 'pong', 'table', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'OK', 'Corral', 'should', 'probably', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed']",N/A
