It is the proverbial s---.Just the the synth-pop music and the hot-pink movie title in cursive across the screen and I knew this was special. You'll not be expecting something that looks and feels like a generic car chase action flick made in 2010-11 here. This is not a Fast and the Furious type movie at all.Stars Ryan Gosling. He plays a part time stunt driver and a get away driver and works in car shop. ""Driver"" is mysterious and you don't know much about him other than what he does. Doesn't talk much.The cast is excellent with a few actors you'll recognize that are better left as surprises. One in particular I associate with playing wimpy nice guys and here he's a cold blooded killer. Another actor is presently best known from TV series Breaking Bad. Anyway, Swedish director Nicolas Winding Refn is a new talent to look out for.Some of the violence is shocking and I  have typically thick skin when it comes to this. Part of the reason I was surprised is that the plot unfolds in surprising ways, or did for this viewer anyway. I honestly had no idea what to expect. Which is a good thing, no?At the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, Drive got praised and even received a standing ovation says wikipedia, and it damn well should have.And the soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, maybe what makes this film so cool more than any other single aspectDrive (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack).5+ stars",5,tasteful,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,1529,"['take', 'action', 'thrillers', 'late', '1970s', '80s', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'homage', 'sorts', 'proverbial', 's', '-.Just', 'synth-pop', 'music', 'hot-pink', 'movie', 'title', 'cursive', 'screen', 'knew', 'was', 'special', ""'ll"", 'not', 'be', 'expecting', 'something', 'feels', 'generic', 'car', 'chase', 'action', 'flick', 'made', '2010-11', 'here', 'not', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'type', 'movie', 'all.Stars', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'part', 'time', 'stunt', 'driver', 'get', 'away', 'driver', 'car', 'shop', 'Driver', 'mysterious', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'other', 'what', 'Does', ""n't"", 'talk', 'much.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'few', 'actors', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'surprises', 'One', 'particular', 'associate', 'playing', 'wimpy', 'nice', 'guys', 'here', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'actor', 'presently', 'best', 'known', 'TV', 'series', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Anyway', 'Swedish', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'new', 'talent', 'look', 'out', 'for.Some', 'violence', 'shocking', 'have', 'typically', 'thick', 'skin', 'when', 'Part', 'reason', 'was', 'surprised', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'surprising', 'ways', 'did', 'viewer', 'anyway', 'honestly', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Which', 'good', 'thing', '2011', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Drive', 'got', 'praised', 'even', 'received', 'standing', 'ovation', 'wikipedia', 'damn', 'well', 'should', 'have.And', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'best', 'soundtracks', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'maybe', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'cool', 'more', 'other', 'single', 'aspectDrive', 'Original', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Soundtrack', '.5+', 'stars']",N/A

Long dull sections broken by over-the-top violence.I am not opposed to violence in action films. However in this movie it is senseless and not needed.

A feel from the 1970's,  and a soundtrack like it came out of the 80's (reverb on the snare....LOVE IT!)  The best way to watch this movie is to just let it unfold.  If you're one of those that likes to try to predict the outcome of movies (like several of my friends, which annoys me, as I watch a movie to be entertained not to ""figure it out""), you won't like it...go watch the latest Hollywood blockbuster.  The story is not that deep, however, there is some vibe or untouchable ""something"" to the screenplay that just affects you on a more substantive, deeper level, it's very hard to explain.  It's almost a comparison to the British ""angry young man"" genre (similar, but not exactly like), which is one of my favorite types of historical fiction film.  I did find it odd that Christina Hendricks (of Mad Men fame) was so hyped up when she only had about a 10-minute part.  She's still very cute, though.  Also, the Mustang/Mopar car chase was a nice touch!  Kudos to whomever threw that in there...an enigmatic reference toBullittwhether it was intended or not!

1509645,A33LLUCE9FZQCF,B0064NTZJO,ACRIMONIOUS,"[1, 3]","This film is a perfect storm, cast/acting, story, directing, all the elements come together perfectly. In the tradition of the works of Michael Mann, this film will go down as one of the greatest Neo-Noir films of all time. The stellar cast including: Ryan Gosling (whom really pulled of the strong silent anti-tough guy aesthetic) Albert Brooks (Bernie Rose), Ron Perlman (Nino ""Izzy"")  (both, very convincing as mid level, aging L.A. gangsters) Bryan Cranston (Shannon) Carey Mulligan (Irene) and my favorite, ginger-haired beauty, Christina Hendricks. (whom we know from Mad Men) Our unnamed protagonist, an underpaid mechanic (Ryan Gosling) moonlights as a  Hollywood stunt driver, and more significantly to the story, a wheel man for various criminals. When ""friend"", employer and schemer (Cranston)  decides that Gosling's talents as a driver could be quite lucrative in the world of Nascar. He approaches Gangster, Bernie Rose, to bankroll the venture. After seeing Gosling's skills on the track, Rose becomes exited with the prospect (the scene where Brooks extends his hand to Gosling, leads to one of the greatest lines in film, right up there with, ""Go-ahead make my day"" or ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" Gosling: ""My hands are a little dirty."" Brooks: ""So are mine."" I love that!) In the midst of all this, Gosling becomes non-romantically involved with a single mom (Carey Mulligan) As she and her son, await the release of her husband, ""Standard"" whom is serving hard time, for an unspecified crime. Though the relationship between Gosling and Mulligan seems have erotic potential. It appears to be more akin to, two lost souls making a much needed inter-personal connection. Gosling's feelings towards her son begin as mere sympathy yet, grow into outright fondness. Upon his release from prison, Mulligan's husband is awkwardly (and surprisingly) approving of the relationship. Though, seemingly remorseful for his crime(s). Standard gets caught up with the wrong people, IE: thugs, whom demand payment for: ""protection in the joint"", IE: a heist. Coincidentally? (and unbeknownst to Gosling) the thugs are employed by Bernie Rose's partner, Nino, AKA: Izzy. (Whom disapproves of Rose's Nascar venture, likely out of jealousy.) Gosling valiantly, but foolishly agrees to help (out of fear of harm to Irene or her son) as the wheel man. And from there...it all goes wrong. Was the whole thing a set-up? and if so, by whom? These are the great questions of great Neo-Noir's. The 80's-esque pop music doesn't fit the dark tone of the film, that's why it's perfect. As I stated, this film was heavily influenced by Michael Mann. Yet I can't call it a rip-off. The intertwining of lives, deceit, greed , betrayal, revenge and of course crime, as I said, all the elements come together. Even if Neo-Noir or Crime Drama is not your thing, you are still likely to enjoy this (very well done) film. Though I must warn you, the violence is graphic.

1509646,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,B0064NTZJO,A customer,"[4, 6]","""Drive"" looks, feels, and sounds like a present day homage to the groundbreaking 1980's film ""To Live and Die in L.A."".To Live and Die in L.A. [Blu-ray].  Both movies deal with the sometimes fine line that people like police and criminals walk between wanting to wear white hats, wanting to wear black hats, and what their internal character ultimately drives them to be.Gosling portrays a car mechanic by day, part time thief by night who gets drawn into the mob world after he performs some racing stuntwork and catches the eye of bigger league criminals whose tentacles reach into the everyday world. A love interest from his apartment building pulls his character towards more noble directions, as he watches her struggle with first raising her child alone, and then back with a troubled husband after he is released from prison. As the husband's past life comes back to haunt him and endangers the family he now can't be a part of, Gosling decides to fight back against the corrupting elements in fairly dramatic fashion. Although he sometimes comes across like a Charles Bronson straight out of ""Deathwish"", taking out low level thugs and mob bosses alike, he ultimately knows he has much in common with those he is killing. This realization doesn't sit well with him, leading to a climax where he cares little if he lives or dies. Going out as ""one of the good guys"" might be for the best, ending things before his true nature has a chance to kick back in.All arthouse jokes aside, if you look at the scorpion on Gosling's jacketDrive (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)and recall the fable of the scorpion and the frog, you know the movie's theme:  when the scorpion stings the frog as they cross a river, drowning them both, and the frog asks ""why did you do that?"", all the scorpion can say is ""I can't help it, it's in my nature"".Criticism of Gosling's performance isn't entirely off base, some scenes are slow and the dialogue can be scant. But this can also perhaps be justified by the character and the film's director.  Lets face it, he plays a person who ISN'T right in the head. He's not going to, and shouldn't, act normal. Although not perfect, it works. Any detraction here is also more than made up for by the strong performance of Albert Brooks. Played for most of the movie as the ""nice guy"" criminal compared to his evil business partner (Ron Perlman), his true character comes to light in the end with a chilling scene (spoiler alert) where he is forced to kill a likable loser of a friend with an old trademark weapon he thought he had hung up a long time ago. It's one of several memorable scenes where Brooks steals the show. At one point Gosling won't shake hands with Brooks because grease makes his hands dirty.  Brooks insists on the handshake anyways. ""So are mine"".If you want to see something like a straight up action movie similar to ""The Transporter"", this isn't it. But if you want to go back in time to the early eighties, taking a little bit of ""Miami Vice"", a dash of ""Scarface"", and even a pinch of ""Halloween"" with some arthouse posing, then ""Drive"" will take you where you want to go.",4,To Live and Drive in L.A.

1509647,AHL35XZ3OND2Z,B0064NTZJO,Adron Gardner,"[1, 3]","Wow. Reading the reviews on Drive is like listening to Republicans and Democrats debate health care - Lots of noise and everybody seems to miss the point.Here's the deal.Drive is an unapologetic riff of pretty much every loner crime revenge story ever made and total line descendant of Michael Mann's Thief from 1980, . So much so, that thanks to the bubbly soundtrack, it seems they might as well have filmed it in 1980 too. Drive is a small-time crime story told with great restraint on characterizations and great explosiveness when it comes to violence. As far as modern influences go, Drive is a sort of crazy hybrid of Paul Verhoeven's Spetters and Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard Eight (Sydney) throw in the last few Cronenberg movies while you're at it.While I don't quite understand the negativity so many haters seem to have for Drive, I understand why some people could be so frustrated by it. Drive is told with Nicolas Winding Refn's European eye for detail and tone. Drive is the definition of character study with a heavy emphasis on STUDY. There is very little quick cutting between camera setups and absolutely zero sitcom-esque axial cut dialog scenes. It is the antithesis of the way most American movies are made. We have been conditioned as a society to watch boxes of talking heads broken up with pointless jabber and largely bloodless violence.  On the other hand, I find it hard to call Drive a masterpiece simply because the director knows how to hold a shot instead of a cut every 6 seconds.Now how you interpret Drive's way to tell a story is largely a question of style and sensibility. Drive is not for every taste and probably not something you'll be in the mood to watch 24/7, but it is very well done when you have the time to invest in it.

The music score and sound for Drive also deserves distinct recognition.

Let me warn any possible viewers that even though this is advertised like an action film, it is not; this is a drama that has moments of action. I said in the film listed above that Ryan Gosling is going to be on great actor status if he keeps up the pace he has. And with 2012's ""The Gangster Squad,"" it looks like he will. In ""Drive,"" Gosling plays the unnamed Driver who is a stunt driver by day, getaway driver by night. He is involuntarily involved with a mobster (Albert Brooks) and lives a simple, very quiet life, but things get complicated when Driver meets and falls in love with his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan). Through extenuating circumstances, Driver finds himself assisting in a heist to help clear Irene's husband's debt to a gangster, but when things go majorly awry, the story really takes off! The drama is suspenseful (the beginning is one of the coolest I've seen in a long time) and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat. Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn took a really good script from Hossein Amini (based on the novel by James Sallis) and made it great: a film that is not just good, but a philosophical, metaphorical story full of symbolism behind every scene (something Orson Welles loved doing in his films -- i.e.,Citizen Kane (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition)).

Drive, has been directed by acclaimed Nicolas Winding Refn. Based on the 2005, James Sallis novel this is a moody film from the music, acting, story and the cinematography.This sketch of a quiet driver ( Ryan Gosling) is acting lessons on wheels because the entire star cast is superb. The driver is a quiet man who does side job driving for con artists and also as a stunt man. He falls in love with the neighbor Irene ( Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio( Kaden Leos) Things start going awfully wrong when Irene's husband is released from prison.Basically this is a very stylized version of the fable about the Scorpion and the Frog. In the story, the frog agrees to carry the scorpion across the river but stings the frog because it is the nature of the scorpion, thus drowning both. In the film, the Driver can be seen as the Frog( ironically, he also wears a scorpion jacket throughout the film, just as the frog carried the scorpion on the back) because he helps/drives scorpions around in his car but is inevitably dragged into their world and stung.

On the positive side, it's beautifully filmed and paced. These aspects make parts of it like the Japanese ""Shall We Dance"", or a Wong Kai War's ""In the Mood For Love"", though the tension and dread have your stomach in knots already. The acting was strong and the music was wonderful, though I felt having the lyrics of ""a real hero"" blasted in my face did not work so well. On the not so positive side, this seemed like a typical violent revenge movie. Yes, I got that the Driver was closed emotionally and his neighbor and child brought out love feelings for him that he may not have understood, but for him kill everyone like a pro when things go wrong? The story seemed to indicate that the Driver was not a trained killer, but he sure knew how to dominate every time. In ""First Blood"", viewers had some idea of why Rambo took revenge and was alienated. However, in ""Drive"", we are supposed to believe that an introverted man will step up to help when he has feelings for a woman, and then become a sociopathic killer to ""save the day"". Not only that, but help the woman's obviously ""in too deep"" husband. Did anyone imagine the heist going well? While it was nice to have a somewhat ambiguous ending and long silent shots, the film when over-the-top in showing violence, letting us see extreme graphic detail. The upside of the violence is that it was very uncomfortable to watch, like real life, the downside is that it seemed like nothing to the characters. I'm sure the filmakers did all of the above on purpose to create a stylized ""epic"". The one thing that did not seem to make sense in the world the film created was the chase scene after the heist.

1509662,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B0064NTZJO,Andrea Polk,"[5, 9]","I tried to keep an open mind going into this film.  Hoped for an action drama with a story that moved as the title and trailers would indicate, but was sadly disappointed when at least a third of the movie was taken up with artsy shots and no dialogue or action.The movie was only 1hr and 41 minutes long, but during the first 20 minutes it's tough to figure out where the film is going.  I kept wishing it would get appreciably better, as the actors in it are good actors - just not a lot for them to do for most of the film!One really great 'drive' sequence, two others were OK, but frankly, even for a girl - there wasn't enough consistent action to make this film good.  Nor was there a lot of acting.  The best acting came from Albert Brooks who plays a bad guy; not his usual gig.There were lots of scenes where Ryan Gosling's character was simply staring out windows or driving through the night, which would be OK if you could count on something meaningful to the story after those scenes, but 'Drive' never really takes you anywhere.  At least not quickly or in a satisfying way.Honestly, I found it tough to watch it from beginning to end.  Consider turning it off after 30 minutes, but held on.Very violent, bloody sequences were expected and the film delivered on that front.  When the story finally did get rolling, Gosling's character develops very little, but you know he's basically a good guy - loyal to his friends even if he's on the fringe with his illegal activity.  Unfortunately he's not particularly interesting or likeable, but you do empathize with him in the end and appreciate he wants to do the right thing.In the end the good guy wins, but it ends very much the way it starts, which felt like driving in circles to me.  The viewer is left wondering who was this guy and why did I let him 'Drive' me anywhere?",3,"A long, tedious ""Drive""",1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,1838,"['tried', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'going', 'film', 'Hoped', 'action', 'drama', 'story', 'moved', 'title', 'trailers', 'would', 'indicate', 'was', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'when', 'least', 'third', 'movie', 'was', 'taken', 'up', 'artsy', 'shots', 'dialogue', 'action.The', 'movie', 'was', 'only', '1hr', '41', 'minutes', 'long', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'tough', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'kept', 'wishing', 'would', 'get', 'appreciably', 'better', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'just', 'not', 'lot', 'do', 'most', 'film', 'One', 'really', 'great', ""'drive"", 'sequence', 'two', 'others', 'were', 'OK', 'frankly', 'even', 'girl', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'consistent', 'action', 'make', 'film', 'good', 'was', 'lot', 'acting', 'best', 'acting', 'came', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'not', 'usual', 'gig.There', 'were', 'lots', 'scenes', 'where', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'character', 'was', 'simply', 'staring', 'out', 'windows', 'driving', 'night', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'could', 'count', 'something', 'meaningful', 'story', 'scenes', 'never', 'really', 'anywhere', 'least', 'not', 'quickly', 'satisfying', 'way.Honestly', 'found', 'tough', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'Consider', 'turning', 'off', '30', 'minutes', 'held', 'on.Very', 'violent', 'bloody', 'sequences', 'were', 'expected', 'film', 'delivered', 'front', 'When', 'story', 'finally', 'did', 'get', 'rolling', 'Gosling', 'character', 'very', 'little', 'know', 'basically', 'good', 'guy', 'loyal', 'friends', 'even', 'fringe', 'illegal', 'activity', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'likeable', 'do', 'empathize', 'end', 'appreciate', 'do', 'right', 'end', 'good', 'guy', 'wins', 'very', 'much', 'way', 'felt', 'driving', 'circles', 'viewer', 'left', 'wondering', 'who', 'was', 'guy', 'why', 'did', 'let', ""'Drive"", 'anywhere']",N/A
1509663,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0064NTZJO,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 9]","Very few films can capture the intensity that `Drive' is able to contain, and do so with such bridled passion for every frame.  What Nicolas Winding Refn does here is similar in scope to what David Fincher was able to achieve with last years `The Social Network'.  Every frame is beautifully composed to exact from us the precise emotion relevant to our understanding and appreciation of the film's structural progression.In other words, this is the directorial masterpiece of the year.But, `Drive' is far more than a mere moody masterwork.  A friend of mine mentioned that this is cinematic to the bone, and that is so true.  Every frame is a visual work of genius, so expressive in its ability to convey richness in tones with a mere shading of atmosphere.  The way that the film is perfectly edited (I mean, for a film so brisk in running time, it manages to fill it's frames with intense action AND detailed character development) suits the film's overall progression and remains instilled in the audience's mind long after the credits have finished rolling.  With muted moments (the dialog is far less important than the body language), `Drive' is a stunning cinematic achievement in a year composed and stunning cinematic achievements (seriously, this year is AMAZING).Ryan Gosling adds yet another knock out performance to his long list of intriguing and diverse characters.  Here he plays a driver (never named) who spends his days working in a garage for a man named Shannon who gets him in to do stunt work for movies and also, when needed, to drive getaway for crooks.  By chance, this driver meets a young mother in the same apartment building he is in.  Her name is Irene and her husband is currently serving time in prison.  They obviously have a connection but that connection is severed when her husband, Standard, is released from prison.  Standard owes some bad people some money but he is unable to pay it, and since the driver doesn't want to see something bad happen to Irene or her son, he offers to help Standard out.Big mistake.The second half of `Drive' shifts gears from brooding character study to intensity driven action flick, but those two worlds mesh marvelously thanks to Gosling's impenetrable stare and Winding Refn's superb handling of each scene's emotional dimensions.  The 80's inspired soundtrack coupled with the purposeful toying with time and speed (that elevator sequence is particularly magnificent) help establish `Drive' as an entity all its own.Yes, this is NOT what you think it'll be, but it is everything you could ask it to be.",5,The return of the noir...,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,2578,"['Very', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'capture', 'intensity', 'Drive', 'able', 'contain', 'do', 'so', 'such', 'bridled', 'passion', 'frame', 'What', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'here', 'similar', 'scope', 'what', 'David', 'Fincher', 'was', 'able', 'achieve', 'last', 'years', 'Social', 'Network', 'frame', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'exact', 'precise', 'emotion', 'relevant', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'film', 'structural', 'progression.In', 'other', 'words', 'directorial', 'masterpiece', 'year.But', 'Drive', 'far', 'more', 'mere', 'moody', 'masterwork', 'friend', 'mine', 'mentioned', 'cinematic', 'bone', 'so', 'true', 'frame', 'visual', 'work', 'genius', 'so', 'expressive', 'ability', 'convey', 'richness', 'tones', 'mere', 'shading', 'atmosphere', 'way', 'film', 'perfectly', 'edited', 'mean', 'film', 'so', 'brisk', 'running', 'time', 'fill', 'frames', 'intense', 'action', 'AND', 'detailed', 'character', 'development', 'suits', 'film', 'overall', 'progression', 'instilled', 'audience', 'mind', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'finished', 'rolling', 'muted', 'moments', 'dialog', 'far', 'less', 'important', 'body', 'language', 'Drive', 'stunning', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'year', 'composed', 'stunning', 'cinematic', 'achievements', 'seriously', 'year', 'AMAZING', '.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'yet', 'knock', 'out', 'performance', 'long', 'list', 'intriguing', 'diverse', 'characters', 'Here', 'driver', 'never', 'named', 'who', 'days', 'working', 'garage', 'man', 'named', 'Shannon', 'who', 'do', 'stunt', 'work', 'movies', 'also', 'when', 'needed', 'drive', 'getaway', 'crooks', 'chance', 'driver', 'young', 'mother', 'same', 'apartment', 'building', 'name', 'Irene', 'husband', 'currently', 'serving', 'time', 'prison', 'obviously', 'have', 'connection', 'connection', 'severed', 'when', 'husband', 'Standard', 'released', 'prison', 'Standard', 'bad', 'people', 'money', 'unable', 'pay', 'driver', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'something', 'bad', 'happen', 'Irene', 'son', 'help', 'Standard', 'out.Big', 'mistake.The', 'second', 'half', 'Drive', 'shifts', 'gears', 'brooding', 'character', 'study', 'intensity', 'driven', 'action', 'flick', 'two', 'worlds', 'mesh', 'marvelously', 'thanks', 'Gosling', 'impenetrable', 'stare', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'superb', 'handling', 'scene', 'emotional', 'dimensions', '80', 'inspired', 'soundtrack', 'coupled', 'purposeful', 'toying', 'time', 'speed', 'elevator', 'sequence', 'particularly', 'magnificent', 'help', 'establish', 'Drive', 'entity', 'own.Yes', 'NOT', 'what', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'everything', 'could', 'ask', 'be']",N/A

But I love it because I love David lynch and that is his technique in most films.I mean there's really no negatives here unless you are just not in to creative movies. I really wish that their were more people out there that knew how to make art. The movie starts off pretty slow but once he realizes he has to take charge of the situation. The gore fest is on and the action is just none stop and interesting. This film definitely doesn't hand it all to you on a platter you have to put it all together. I certainly hope this director is nominated for at least cinematography or story. I haven't felt a movie in along time and I actually felt this movie. It really had me in a certain mind frame and mood due to the way the music was and the over all Ora of the film. The soundtrack is another thing that really did it for me. Its sounds like a mix of DaftPunk and some Andreas Kleerup type music. Almost like foreign electro pop or synth tripped out music.

Within the first few minutes of this movie, I thought this movie with Ryan Gosling was going to be something similar. Well, it started off promising enough, then starts getting more and more farfetched by the minute! As it turns out, Gosling's character is a movie stunt driver by day and robbery getaway driver by night. OK, interesting enough. But all of a sudden, he turns into this unstoppable Jason Bourne-esque Terminator who can take out any hardened mob soldier with a flick of the wrist--SUP-ER-MAAAAN! Come on! I don't think it's too realistic that some stunt driver can single-handedly wipe out an entire flank of the mob!He goes on this killing spree (at least he's wiping out bad guys, I'll give him that) without so much of a blink of an eye, as if he has no emotional psyche whatsoever. So it's kind of ironic that he does all this because he LOVES the girl and his kid so much--weird. *SPOILER ALERT*...OK, so he's doing all this killing (with the experience and skill of a well-trained killer, which in the beginning of the movie, there is no indication of such skills) in the name of love, but then he just ups and leaves her anyway. OK, he didn't want any future trouble following him to affect the girl and her kid. But how can this be a worry? He's SUPERMAN! At the end he gets stabbed in the gut with a huge knife by a mobster who has extensive experience in killing people, who of course Gosling's character has no trouble in killing in return. AND THEN HE JUST WALKS OVER TO HIS CAR AND DRIVES AWAY! HUH?? Boy, he's in the wrong business...he should be working for the military as their secret weapon, indestructible one-man army! If the movie had gone on any longer, it would have turned into the Speed Racer cartoons where Speed's car plummets off a cliff, crashes, explodes, and Speed just walks away, without a scratch, hair neatly combed...lol! *END SPOILER ALERT*So I liked the acting in this movie, but the story just got too farfetched for me.

1509676,A2W75RZ6WA9DCN,B0064NTZJO,"Banon ""IronMan004""","[2, 3]","The Driver (or &#8220;The Kid&#8221; as he&#8217;s sometimes called) has no real name, at least nothing that&#8217;s ever spoken. He is what he does, and that is drive cars. When he&#8217;s not being paid to do so as a movie stunt man, he&#8217;s paid by criminals as a driver-for-hire. He feels little attachment to others and speaks even less. Still, beneath the silent exterior there&#8217;s a hidden depth where he keeps his moral convictions and code. This kind of hero is familiar, if a bit old school. The Driver is clearly modeled after characters like Steve McQueen&#8217;s Frank Bullitt, Clint Eastwood&#8217;s the Man with no Name, Toshiro Mifune&#8217;s Yojimbo, or even Alain Delon&#8217;s Jef Costello. In this case, where his true nature is revealed comes from his associations with his neighbor Irene and her son, Benicio.Even though the title is Drive, there isn&#8217;t actually all that much driving to be seen in this movie. There are a few chase sequences, and they&#8217;re well shot with no visible use of CGI, but the bulk of the movie follows the Driver as he interacts with Irene and her son, which allows him to display a hint of his humanity, which seems to be something that hasn&#8217;t surfaced in a long time. The first reveal of the character is while he&#8217;s working. The movie even begins with him firmly explaining the rules that go along with hiring him. It reminded me a little of The Transporter, but luckily the similarities end there. While on the job, we see the way in which he drives. He&#8217;s a true professional, and is not about long and over-the-top car chases. Instead, we see him triumph over the police through his knowledge of the streets and ability to blend into his surroundings (he even drives a Chevy Impala).The characters are crucial to the flow of the story, and it&#8217;s refreshing to see their importance placed over the need to meet expectations of the typical car chase movies. The cast is excellent, featuring Ryan Gosling as the nameless stone-faced protagonist. Although Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn adds a lot of style to the film and really tries to present Gosling as a tough character to match some of the examples I compared him to, he never quite reaches those heights. The character works, but Ryan Gosling doesn&#8217;t have the same screen presence as, for example, Steve McQueen does. Maybe he&#8217;s just too young, but he lacks that look of someone who&#8217;s had a lot of bad experiences and a tough past. As Irene, Carey Mulligan is adorable and fits the part of her role (though it&#8217;s a bit difficult to imagine how she ended up married to a criminal), and Bryan Cranston also gives an understated performance as Shannon, the man who hired the Driver and repairs/modifies his cars. The real scene stealers come from the bad guys however, who run a local pizza joint in L.A. They represent a Jewish sect of a larger mob family apparently, with Albert Brooks&#8217;s character being a former action movie producer turned organized crime boss. He&#8217;s in no way meant to be humorous (and trust me, he isn&#8217;t), and his partner is played by the always entertaining Ron Perlman, a mobster who resents the small time operation he runs with Brooks on the west coast. The two of them are vicious and ruthless killers who, through an uncanny string of bad luck and circumstances, find themselves at war with the Driver.The film is very stylized and though it seems to hearken back to action films of the &#8216;60s and &#8216;70s, it has an almost oddly &#8216;80s feel to it due to the synthesizer-heavy soundtrack (though this choice of music may be due to the European tastes of the director). There&#8217;s a lot of slow motion and Refn takes his time telling the story, focusing primarily on developing his characters. Interestingly, because of the reserved and backstoryless nature of the protagonist, a few of his &#8220;bonding&#8221; scenes with Irene are shown through montage, which keeps us at a constant distance with him. This makes the hyper-violent actions scenes all the more shocking, because we aren&#8217;t shown that he&#8217;s capable of that level of violence. Still, making the film about the Driver instead of his actual driving is a good choice and makes the story that much more interesting when the action does present itself. Compared to other films in this genre, Drive is an interesting change of pace and a stylish alternative to the sub-par norm. It&#8217;s packed with good performances and tells a compelling and layered story. And isn&#8217;t watching Albert Brooks stab someone worth the price of admission?",5,Excellent movie,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,4647,"['Driver', '8220', 'Kid', '8221', '8217', 'sometimes', 'called', 'real', 'name', 'least', 'nothing', '8217', 'ever', 'spoken', 'what', 'drive', 'cars', 'When', '8217', 'not', 'being', 'paid', 'do', 'so', 'movie', 'stunt', 'man', '8217', 's', 'paid', 'criminals', 'driver-for-hire', 'little', 'attachment', 'others', 'speaks', 'even', 'less', 'Still', 'silent', 'exterior', '8217', 's', 'hidden', 'depth', 'where', 'moral', 'convictions', 'code', 'kind', 'hero', 'familiar', 'bit', 'old', 'school', 'Driver', 'clearly', 'modeled', 'characters', 'Steve', 'McQueen', '8217', 'Frank', 'Bullitt', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', '8217', 's', 'Man', 'Name', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', '8217', 'Yojimbo', 'even', 'Alain', 'Delon', '8217', 'Jef', 'Costello', 'case', 'where', 'true', 'nature', 'revealed', 'associations', 'neighbor', 'Irene', 'son', 'Benicio.Even', 'title', 'Drive', 'isn', '8217', 'actually', 'much', 'driving', 'be', 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'chase', 'sequences', '8217', 're', 'well', 'shot', 'visible', 'use', 'CGI', 'bulk', 'movie', 'Driver', 'Irene', 'son', 'display', 'hint', 'humanity', 'be', 'something', 'hasn', '8217', 't', 'surfaced', 'long', 'time', 'first', 'reveal', 'character', '8217', 'working', 'movie', 'even', 'firmly', 'explaining', 'rules', 'go', 'along', 'hiring', 'reminded', 'little', 'Transporter', 'luckily', 'similarities', 'end', 'there', 'job', 'see', 'way', '8217', 's', 'true', 'professional', 'not', 'long', 'over-the-top', 'car', 'chases', 'Instead', 'see', 'triumph', 'police', 'knowledge', 'streets', 'ability', 'blend', 'surroundings', 'even', 'Chevy', 'Impala', '.The', 'characters', 'are', 'crucial', 'flow', 'story', '8217', 'refreshing', 'see', 'importance', 'placed', 'need', 'meet', 'expectations', 'typical', 'car', 'chase', 'movies', 'cast', 'excellent', 'featuring', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'nameless', 'stone-faced', 'protagonist', 'Danish', 'director', 'Nicholas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'lot', 'style', 'film', 'really', 'tries', 'present', 'Gosling', 'tough', 'character', 'match', 'examples', 'compared', 'never', 'quite', 'heights', 'character', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'doesn', '8217', 'have', 'same', 'screen', 'presence', 'example', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Maybe', '8217', 's', 'just', 'too', 'young', 'look', 'someone', 'who', '8217', 'had', 'lot', 'bad', 'experiences', 'tough', 'past', 'Irene', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'adorable', 'part', 'role', '8217', 's', 'bit', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'married', 'criminal', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'also', 'understated', 'performance', 'Shannon', 'man', 'who', 'hired', 'Driver', 'cars', 'real', 'scene', 'stealers', 'come', 'bad', 'guys', 'however', 'who', 'run', 'local', 'pizza', 'joint', 'L.A', 'represent', 'Jewish', 'sect', 'larger', 'mob', 'family', 'apparently', 'Albert', 'Brooks', '8217', 'character', 'being', 'former', 'action', 'movie', 'producer', 'turned', 'organized', 'crime', 'boss', '8217', 's', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'humorous', 'trust', '8217', 't', 'partner', 'played', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'mobster', 'who', 'small', 'time', 'operation', 'Brooks', 'west', 'coast', 'two', 'are', 'vicious', 'ruthless', 'killers', 'who', 'uncanny', 'string', 'bad', 'luck', 'circumstances', 'find', 'war', 'Driver.The', 'film', 'very', 'stylized', 'hearken', 'back', 'action', 'films', '8216', '60s', '8216', '70s', 'almost', 'oddly', '8216', '80s', 'feel', 'due', 'synthesizer-heavy', 'soundtrack', 'choice', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'European', 'tastes', 'director', '8217', 's', 'lot', 'slow', 'motion', 'Refn', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'focusing', 'primarily', 'developing', 'characters', 'Interestingly', 'reserved', 'backstoryless', 'nature', 'protagonist', 'few', '8220', 'bonding', '8221', 'scenes', 'Irene', 'are', 'shown', 'montage', 'constant', 'distance', 'hyper-violent', 'actions', 'scenes', 'more', 'shocking', 'aren', '8217', 'shown', '8217', 'capable', 'level', 'violence', 'Still', 'making', 'film', 'Driver', 'instead', 'actual', 'driving', 'good', 'choice', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'action', 'present', 'Compared', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'Drive', 'interesting', 'change', 'pace', 'stylish', 'alternative', 'sub-par', 'norm', '8217', 'packed', 'good', 'performances', 'compelling', 'layered', 'story', 'isn', '8217', 'watching', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'stab', 'someone', 'price', 'admission']",N/A

1509679,A1Z98R6UK5T00L,B0064NTZJO,Ben.W,"[7, 10]","`Drive' really surprised me. I was never really interested in seeing this, I'd read the articles and seen the posters and ended up dismissing it, I only watched it because there wasn't anything else and didn't have high expectations. But, as it turns out, the film really blew my first impressions away. Instead of being bored, I found myself drawn into the film and caring for its characters, the acting was spot-on and Refn's direction made this movie a real gem.Ryan Gosling is Driver, a solitary guy who works as a mechanic and stunt car driver by day and getaway driver-for-hire at night, that is until he meets his neighbour, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her son. The more time he spends with them, he falls for Irene in a somewhat romantic fairy tale....until it all comes crashing down when Irene's ex-con husband (Oscar Isaac) returns, bringing with him trouble and compelling Driver to protect Irene and her son from gangsters.What really stops this movie from becoming a cookie-cutter action-drama film is the fact that director Nicolas Winding Refn concentrates on giving us well-rounded characters. It's the characters that drive `Drive', not the action or the story and Refn's stylistic way of shooting it - with slow-motion and lingering shots of characters and still camera work - makes sure that what's unspoken speaks the loudest as he leaves it up to you to interpret their feelings and thoughts. It's not what happens when they speak, but more what goes unspoken through looks and body language. I don't know what you call it - noir or artistic or whatever - it's an approach that's been used by many directors before, but it makes `Drive' absorbing to watch.Of course, it wouldn't work without the actors giving top-notch performances and nobody lets the movie down here. Gosling is magnetic as Driver, conveying layers of emotion without uttering a word in some scenes. Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman also give stellar performances that make them more than one-dimensional villains. The one surprise for me was Bryan Cranston, I don't watch `Breaking Bad', but he proves he can stretch his acting chops far beyond quirky sit-com comedy characters. Carey Mulligan, Oscar Isaac, the criminally underused Christina Hendricks, all did admirably and were very believable in their roles.There are scenes of action throughout the film as well and they can be shockingly brutal, especially when compared to the mostly quiet tone of the film, one particular character's demise from a shot gun through a window will stick with me for a while and the car chases are tight and well executed.But this isn't an action film first, if I had to call it something, I'd say it's more like an artsy, character-driven drama. Whether you'll enjoy it or not probably depends on whether you think long, quiet, reflective scenes with lingering shots of characters staring at each other are thought-provoking and beautiful, or a director being self-indulgent and pretentious. Personally, I loved it because it engaged me emotionally and the cinematography work was stunning, this is one that stayed with me long after the credits rolled.",5,An unexpected gem...,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,3131,"['Drive', 'really', 'surprised', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'interested', 'seeing', ""'d"", 'read', 'articles', 'seen', 'posters', 'ended', 'up', 'dismissing', 'only', 'watched', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'out', 'film', 'really', 'blew', 'first', 'impressions', 'away', 'Instead', 'being', 'bored', 'found', 'drawn', 'film', 'caring', 'characters', 'acting', 'was', 'spot-on', 'Refn', 'direction', 'made', 'movie', 'real', 'gem.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Driver', 'solitary', 'guy', 'who', 'mechanic', 'stunt', 'car', 'driver', 'day', 'getaway', 'driver-for-hire', 'night', 'neighbour', 'Irene', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'son', 'more', 'time', 'Irene', 'somewhat', 'romantic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'Irene', 'ex-con', 'husband', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'returns', 'bringing', 'trouble', 'compelling', 'Driver', 'protect', 'Irene', 'son', 'gangsters.What', 'really', 'movie', 'becoming', 'cookie-cutter', 'action-drama', 'film', 'fact', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'giving', 'well-rounded', 'characters', 'characters', 'drive', 'Drive', 'not', 'action', 'story', 'Refn', 'stylistic', 'way', 'shooting', 'slow-motion', 'lingering', 'shots', 'characters', 'still', 'camera', 'work', 'sure', 'what', 'unspoken', 'loudest', 'up', 'interpret', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'not', 'what', 'when', 'speak', 'more', 'what', 'unspoken', 'looks', 'body', 'language', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'call', 'noir', 'artistic', 'approach', 'been', 'used', 'many', 'directors', 'Drive', 'absorbing', 'watch.Of', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'actors', 'giving', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'nobody', 'movie', 'down', 'here', 'Gosling', 'magnetic', 'Driver', 'conveying', 'layers', 'emotion', 'uttering', 'word', 'scenes', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'also', 'give', 'stellar', 'performances', 'make', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'villains', 'one', 'surprise', 'was', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'can', 'stretch', 'acting', 'chops', 'far', 'quirky', 'sit-com', 'comedy', 'characters', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'criminally', 'underused', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'did', 'admirably', 'were', 'very', 'believable', 'are', 'scenes', 'action', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'shockingly', 'brutal', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'tone', 'film', 'one', 'particular', 'character', 'demise', 'shot', 'gun', 'window', 'will', 'stick', 'while', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'tight', 'well', 'executed.But', ""n't"", 'action', 'film', 'first', 'had', 'call', 'something', ""'d"", 'say', 'more', 'artsy', 'character-driven', 'drama', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'not', 'probably', 'think', 'long', 'quiet', 'reflective', 'scenes', 'lingering', 'shots', 'characters', 'staring', 'other', 'are', 'thought-provoking', 'beautiful', 'director', 'being', 'self-indulgent', 'pretentious', 'Personally', 'loved', 'engaged', 'emotionally', 'cinematography', 'work', 'was', 'stunning', 'one', 'stayed', 'long', 'credits', 'rolled']",N/A

1509689,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B0064NTZJO,Brian Driver,"[1, 2]","'I'd been hearing about it for a while, and I had to admit I didn't get the buzz.  ""It's a really great film!""  ""This movie is really surprising people!""  ""Ryan Gosling is terrific!""Ryan Gosling?  What?  The baby-faced guy from ""The Notebook""?  The nut from ""Lars and the Real Girl""?Yes--the same guy.  And boy, does he deliver.""Drive"" is a movie that will sit in your head for days after you see it.  This is a very strange film, not easily definable, and not at all what you think it's going to be.It's romantic.  It's very violent.  It has several twists in it that I found either shocking or disturbing, or both.  And it's a film that makes no bones about making it extremely difficult to pin characters down into easy stereotypes.Don't worry: I won't provide any spoilers.  I'll just say this: Gosling plays a near silent man named/described as, simply, Driver.  An absolute whiz behind the wheel, when he's not busy at his day job as a car mechanic or a Hollywood stunt driver he moonlights as a man who will drive questionable guys where they need to go, no questions asked.  Here's how he puts it...""There's a hundred-thousand streets in this city. You don't need to know the route. You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. No matter what. Anything happens a minute either side of that and you're on your own.""And that's almost all he says throughout the film.  But he really doesn't need to...he speaks pages with those great eyes, whether he's admiring Irene, watching over her young son Benicio, or staring the hell out of some rotten guy who is trying to hurt them.In the manner of the great Steve McQueen, Gosling is able to express an awful lot with those baby blues, and his near silence really works to establish him as a man who speaks rarely but is by no means inexpressive.  It's hard not to latch on to his iconic smile when he sees Irene, and to understand his feeling of dismay when he finds out she has an ex-con husband who's coming home from prison in a couple of days.And that's when the trouble begins.  It's easy to see that Driver does best when he lives on his own terms, but now he feels he needs to watch out for Irene's loser of a husband and that's when things begin to get ugly.  I mean, real ugly.  And Driver finds himself embroiled in a war he didn't want, but to his credit he won't back away, either.  It's all in those eyes: you just know he won't let Irene or Benicio down.There's quite a pedigree in this film, too: Carey Mulligan is Irene, Albert Brooks is a crime boss, as is his hair trigger partner Ron Perlman, and Bryan Cranston is Gosling's boss at the garage,  There are several other young actors of note here as well, but much credit has to go to the movie's director, Nicolas Winding Refn, a Danish director who is no stranger to violent movies about the dark underbelly of life, most recently directing 2009's ""Bronson,"" starring Tom Hardy (soon to become Bane, Batman's formidable nemesis in ""The Dark Knight Rises."")  Refn does a fine job letting the film speak for itself, letting its actors walk a fine line between the notions of good and evil, making it very hard to pick absolutes within this film.In fact, when this movie is over it is very hard to clearly define anyone within this movie, and that includes Driver.  ""Drive"" is willing to allow itself to intermingle traditional concepts of right and wrong, and very few people can be easily categorized here.  It makes for interesting watching, and will probably make the film resonate for you for quite a while.If you hadn't guessed, I'm most impressed with Gosling, whom I'd thought was a simple hot chickflick guy who filled in the blanks when a romantic movie needed a hot dude.  But I realize now that he'd done the same thing in ""The Notebook,"" too.  He says a lot without saying a lot.  He definitely has acting chops.I'm looking forward to Gosling's next role, ""Only God Forgives,"" a Bangkok thriller pairing him with Refn once again.  Also along for the ride is Kristen Scott Thomas.  Gosling was reported as describing the script of ""Only God Forgives"" as ""the strangest thing I've ever read and it's only going to get stranger.""And this from a man who made ""Drive.""

I certainly never watched him on tv in THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUB. Although most of his fellow and sister mousers went on to big show biz careers, usually as singers, he is the only one to emerge as a major film star (from any incarnation of the MMC). This film is the capper for an incredible year from him on film.  I hope he does very well at the awards shows because he deserves anything he wins.In all the other movies he made for this year, he was the best thing in them.  The difference with DRIVE is that the film is as good as he is as are the other actors in it.  However, we also have a dream team of actors here.  Albert Brooks makes an absolutely superb villain.  He even has comedy in a few of his villainous moments. Bryan Cranston (almost unrecognizable from his role as Walt in BREAKING BAD), is the weak, unlucky boss to Gosling. Carey Mulligan is the romantic interest and she is wonderful.  Christina Hendrickson from MAD MEN has a brief turn as a gun moll and she is her usual vixen self.Everyone who surrounds Gosling's character seems to think all he excels in is fixing cars and driving extremely well.  Yes, he is quite good at both.  However, no one seems to put together the extraordinary reflexes, instincts and fearlessness such a person would have to have not to end up as road kill.

What a stunning actor-he sets the bar for all those young handsome 30 somethings in Hollywood right now.  This movie is mind altering. First glance tells you its another high octane car racing movie.  It is definitely not that.  The Driver is much more complex than expected.  He seems to have no quibbles with those who break the law and aids them for a price.  What is not expected from him is the genuine caring and quiet assurance he gives the woman and child to whom he owes nothing. The scene with the Driver watching cartoons on the couch with the small boy is very telling and deeply moving.  He offers the boy the caring his father cannot give from prison.  The Driver steps up to help the boy's father pay off his prison obiligations for the sake of the child and his Mother, played very softly by Carey Mulligan. The supporting players in Drive are chilling-Albert Brooks is the sleaziest mobster ever. We are all glad when he gets what he has coming to him.  Ron Perlman makes us cheer for his cumuppance when delivered with steely resolve by the Driver.

1509701,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0064NTZJO,Chris Kennison,"[1, 1]","Ryan Gosling is about to have a really big year and movies like DRIVE are a big reason. DRIVE is a stylistic artistic noire thriller that at times seems to be a throwback to movies of the 80s like ""To Live and Die in L.A."" or ""No Man's Land"" and at times is as grisly and violent as a Quentin Tarantino film. Apart from that, DRIVE is in a category all its own.The director of DRIVE, Nicolas Winding Refn, is sort of new on the scene and his style in this movie is to be respected and remembered. Too often these days movies and their directors think they have to blow everything up and dazzle you with constant barrages of events, but Refn proved that not to be true. Each and every scene in this film tells a little story and not a single one of those scenes should or can be missed. So, take care of your refreshment and bathroom duties before hand.Ryan Gosling plays a man simply known as Driver. Driver is a soft spoken enigma of a man, who races cars, drives stunt cars for the movies, hires himself out for getaway jobs, works as a mechanic and eventually through a course of events, ends up in the middle of a heist that changes his life forever. Driver is a man of few words, but has a coolness that had me thinking of Steve McQueen in Bullitt or a suave James Dean.The most notable thing about DRIVE is its style and its quiet ability to make you the audience feel like you are in the same room with the characters, watching the thing take place in real time. It isn't just a violent action film, it's a story of people and how people affect each other. The scenes where driver (Gosling) is barreling down the highway at break neck speeds are meaningless without the quiet scenes he spends with the neighbor and her child watching cartoons and living a normal life. Those quiet scenes invest you in the lives of the people on screen.I haven't seen a movie in years that had me so invested in the characters. The movie sucks you in. I only wish the entire movie was as glorious, rich and unique as the build up.

I *didn't* see it until now for the same reasons probably many people *did* go see it, and were then disappointed: in my area, it was marketed like a car chase action movie. I have to be in the right mood for those, and I just wasn't at the time it was in theaters. But I should have gone to see it on the big screen when it was out (and I should have remembered that Gosling was compulsively watchable in Half Nelson). Instead I finally saw it via Netflix on my 47"" TV. There is a local movie revival house that sometimes screens cult movies at midnight or matinees, and I'm hoping that they screen Drive one of these days, so I can finally see it on the big screen. I feel it should be seen on a big screen, although it fares well on a big screen TV in a small living room!Drive is no car chase movie. And although there is a lot of driving, much of it is meditative and quiet, the protagonist (Ryan Gosling) alone in his car, safely ensconced away from the rest of the world. Despite the dangers inherent in the stunt (and getaway car) driving he does, he is such a tightly wound and controlled character that you sense there is little danger in what he does for a living, and that he is in total control of the car. The problem is that life lever lets anyone stay in total control for long, and life is far more dangerous in its unpredictability than the controlled and choreographed chaos of a movie set.Others have described the plot in detail, so I won't go into it here, except to say that while it seems to be fairly simple and straightforward, the old adage applies. Simple does not necessarily mean easy as many a 40s noir pic has told  us before. The protagonist's efforts to positively influence the outcome of the situations unfortunately do not bear the fruit you sense he hopes for.This is a movie that tells its story with a stylized visual economy and surprisingly little dialogue. It tells the story without telegraphing major plot points first, yay; I'm so tired of movies having to foreshadow everything so heavily because they assume the audience is stupid. As a result, I was genuinely surprised by the plot twists, which doesn't often happen to me anymore. Yet despite the fact that Drive's clear, often stark visuals tell the story in a fairly straightforward, if noir and moody, style, it bears repeat watching -- I'm already on my third viewing.Gosling gives a finely nuanced performance, but I felt the rest of the ensemble were all very well cast, especially Brian Cranston, Albert Brooks, and Ron Perlman. Carey Mulligan is possibly the weakest link, though not really, since her character seems deliberately somewhat emotionally ambiguous and fuzzy-edged. I wondered while watching how Michelle Williams might have played it, but that's nothing against Mulligan; she pulls it off with a similarly nuanced performance to Gosling's, but it is Gosling and Cranston who really stand out. Christina Hendricks, who has only a bit part, also holds her own in her scenes, although her character is the least developed and the most cliche. Brooks plays against type the most, but Perlman is effective in his coarse, greedy, mob-connected character.Mulligan and Gosling build a believable sexual tension and chemistry until you are practically aching for them to come together in a way you sense they must be aching for each other. As the plot unfolds, you realize that both hold themselves back from each other and are somewhat reserved, either by their nature (Gosling's character) or by their circumstances (Mulligan's), or both.When Gosling's character seizes the moment and they finally come together, he passionately unfurls all that pent up tension and Mulligan's character authentically responds. The immediate aftermath of that sweetness and passion makes it even more poignant, when it quickly becomes apparent that it was motivated as much or more by a fierce protectiveness as it was by passion. His protectiveness is necessarily brutal in eliminating a truly evil threat, in the way that men fiercely protect that which they most care about. But his brutality clearly unnerves and frightens her, in the way that women always become frightened of men when they show their true capacity for violence.This story is told with a beautiful visual economy. There are cliche-ish helicopter-shot overhead views of the glittering downtown LA skyscrapers sprinkled here and there throughout the movie. Yet you sense that those are included to contrast with the low level interior shots in the apartments, grocery store, auto shop, and especially inside the cars, which feel even more intimate by comparison. The cinematography and direction portray this interior/exterior dichotomy. The vast majority of the truly bloody violence occurs in close quarters between people. The car chases, crashes, and the use of cars as weapon are the only non-bloody violence, and they naturally occur outside. It's as if, in the protagonist's world, the threat posed by people and their physical proximity is much more dangerous than the implied threats of violence inherent in cars driven for stunts or robbery getaways.The dialogue is also very economical. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that so much is told visually, you almost don't need dialogue at all in the first 40-45 minutes of the movie. Paradoxically, the chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan is enhanced by them so rarely speaking. Her shining eyes, the upturned corner of his lip, the way they hold each other's gazes -- it really builds the tension. The same goes for the relationship that builds between her son Benicio and the Driver. A lot of it is built in smiles, stares, and shared gazes, before he ever picks the kid up to carry him inside to bed.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the soundtrack. There is a reason it was hot on Itunes last year. Though the moods conjured are very different, the way the soundtrack was used in Drive reminded me a lot of the way the soundtrack was used in The Virgin Suicides (which was scored by Air, not Cliff Martinez, who scored Drive). I was surprised, and then not, when I found out that Cliff Martinez had also done the soundtrack to Soderberg's remade Solaris with Clooney, which was also very haunting and moody. The synthy electronica of Drive's soundtrack harkens back to the 80s for me, but it still feels very modern in its throwback/retro way. It also reminded me a bit of the soundtrack to Risky Business, by Tangerine Dream. Turns out (I read later) that that was intentional on the part of the director.If you liked those soundtracks and the way they suited and underscored the mood and characters of those movies, you'll probably like Drive's soundtrack. By the same token, if you like the synthpop sounds of the likes of Kraftwerk, early Depeche Mode (when Vince Clarke was still with them, before he started Yaz with Alison Moyet), Yaz, and Gary Numan, you'll like Drive's soundtrack. I always hated the way that so many 80s and 90s movies turned into stitched together music videos, with dialogue-less scenes where the protagonist trains for his/her wrestling meet/dance-off to the sounds of some 80s pop. In those particular movies (Virgin Suicides, Risky Business, and Drive), though the soundtrack is almost a character in the film, it is not off-putting to me the same way those stupid movie montages are... probably because none of those movies have those stupid protagonist-training-for-wrestling-meet/dance-competition scenes.I have not seen other movies by this director, but I plan to. And next time Gosling is in a film, I'll go see it, no matter how it's marketed (or mis-marketed), because so far everything I've seen him in has been really good, or he's been really good in it, or both. While he theoretically has that eye candy appeal, he really doesn't show any skin in this movie. (Although he is rather poured into his tight jeans, white Ts, and denim jacket. But then, Christina Hendricks is similarly poured into her clothes). In fact, none of the main characters shows any skin in this movie, and the movie does not suffer for that. Later, a brief scene in a strip club show tons of T&A.; But that scene is so matter of fact, and the strippers are such copies of each other, they're more like Stepford Strippers. That this is the only scene with nudity of any kind makes me wonder if the director meant to thumb his nose at the ubiquity of nudity in Hollywood. In fact, that lack of skin for the two main characters -- the Driver and Irene -- might be what makes their relationship that much more compelling, in this era of ""show everything.""A note about the violence: some people would undoubtedly describe this as a terribly violent film. I disagree; I've seen gorefests that had 20 times the amount of violence and gore that this film has.What sets Drive's violence apart is the fact that it is not action porn; it is violent punctuation of the story's plot points. It reminded me of the violence in Eastern Promises: brief but startling, brutal, bloody and realistic. This is not the kind of violence you cheer on like an action hero offing his numerous opponents in cartoonish, splattery ways. This is much more like real life violence: infrequent, short-lived, brutal, bloody, and liable to make you upset or at least uncomfortable. Be prepared for that.",5,"NOT an action/car chase movie: deeper, cooler, more ethereal and haunting (NO SPOILERS)",1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,9387,"['should', ""n't"", 'have', 'waited', 'so',

However, it is only recently that I have been driven to take the time to write a review of it.  I loaned the DVD to my best friend and we discussed it afterwards.  That discussion is what drove me to write this review.This is one of those ""atmosphere"" movies, in my view.  The atmosphere in the scenes sort of took the attention away from the characters and the plot.  Especially that very last scene, after the kid's confrontation with the mobster.  And that need to emphasize the atmosphere also made the movie slow-moving.The main character is a mysterious young man who makes his living doing stunt work for cheap movies.  On the side, he moonlights as a criminal who transports people in exchange for cash.  Sort of like the Frank Martin character in the Transporter franchise.  But make no mistake.  This is a much darker, much more violent movie than the Transporter trilogy.The driver is a loner, living alone, speaking only to those he must.  You get the impression that he has experienced a lot of trauma.  There is a sadness about him, but also confidence.  He's one of those people that carries a lot of pain with him.  Trouble starts when he opens the emotional door and makes friends with his neighbor, a young woman living alone with her young son.  As he spends time with them, he becomes attach to them.  Later, the woman's husband completes his prison sentence and comes back to live with them.  The driver ends up becoming friends with Gabriel, the husband.  Unfortunately for them, Gabriel's old associates are not finished with him.  To help the family, the driver agrees to help Gabriel pull off a robbery.  And talk about a robbery gone bad!The movie stars Ryan Gosling, Carrie Mulligan, Albert Brooks, and Ron Pearlman.  This is one movie where the acting is beyond reproach.  Gosling reaffirms his position as one of Hollywood's rising stars.  And Albert Brooks, in an atypical role for him, plays his nemesis.  The movie would rate as over-the-top in violence.  Action is pretty good.  The driving scenes are done very well.  This is not Ryan Gosling's best work, but it is pretty good.  Be forewarned that this is not anything like the Transporter movies.  This one is very violent.  Much too violent than it needs to be, in my opinion.  It does try too hard to make the driver larger than life.  In a way, this makes him somewhat unrealistic or implausible in a non-human way.  He reminds me of Lt. Martin Castillo in the Miami Vice television series.",3,Driven to review!,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2519,"['bought', 'movie', 'earlier', 'year', 'However', 'only', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'take', 'time', 'write', 'review', 'loaned', 'DVD', 'best', 'friend', 'discussed', 'discussion', 'what', 'drove', 'write', 'review.This', 'one', 'atmosphere', 'movies', 'view', 'atmosphere', 'scenes', 'sort', 'took', 'attention', 'away', 'characters', 'plot', 'Especially', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'kid', 'confrontation', 'mobster', 'need', 'emphasize', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'made', 'movie', 'slow-moving.The', 'main', 'character', 'mysterious', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'doing', 'stunt', 'work', 'cheap', 'movies', 'side', 'criminal', 'who', 'people', 'exchange', 'cash', 'Sort', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'character', 'Transporter', 'franchise', 'make', 'mistake', 'much', 'darker', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'movie', 'Transporter', 'trilogy.The', 'driver', 'loner', 'living', 'alone', 'speaking', 'only', 'must', 'get', 'impression', 'experienced', 'lot', 'trauma', 'sadness', 'also', 'confidence', 'one', 'people', 'lot', 'pain', 'Trouble', 'starts', 'when', 'emotional', 'door', 'friends', 'neighbor', 'young', 'woman', 'living', 'alone', 'young', 'son', 'time', 'attach', 'Later', 'woman', 'husband', 'prison', 'sentence', 'back', 'live', 'driver', 'up', 'becoming', 'friends', 'Gabriel', 'husband', 'Unfortunately', 'Gabriel', 'old', 'associates', 'are', 'not', 'finished', 'help', 'family', 'driver', 'help', 'Gabriel', 'pull', 'off', 'robbery', 'talk', 'robbery', 'gone', 'bad', 'movie', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Carrie', 'Mulligan', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Ron', 'Pearlman', 'one', 'movie', 'where', 'acting', 'reproach', 'Gosling', 'position', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'rising', 'stars', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'atypical', 'role', 'nemesis', 'movie', 'would', 'rate', 'over-the-top', 'violence', 'Action', 'pretty', 'good', 'driving', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'best', 'work', 'pretty', 'good', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'not', 'anything', 'Transporter', 'movies', 'one', 'very', 'violent', 'Much', 'too', 'violent', 'be', 'opinion', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'driver', 'larger', 'life', 'way', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'implausible', 'non-human', 'way', 'Lt.', 'Martin', 'Castillo', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'television', 'series']",N/A

To some, it may sound stupid, or even boring but which, I thought would be ""brilliant!"" And from the first five minutes of the film, I can see how anyone might gather that connection. Well, if you too had that impression, you're wrong about one thing: This is NOT a TRANSPORTER film! From it's jarring 70's style poppy-techno-roller-disco vibe soundtrack to its eerie non-descript era and throwback locales this film quickly turns on a...well, pardon the pun, drive. Gosling takes on a departure role of action hero. Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds! He still plays it with that signature slow-to-the-draw subtle demeanor, but don't let that fool you. There's an elevator scene, which rivals Ed Norton's ""head cruncher"" in American History X, and during which time I had a notion to stand up and attempt to literally grab and shake Gosling by the shoulder (through the screen) and shout, ""Ok, he's dead! He's dead!""Some surprisingly familiar and longtime seen faces crop up in this film, Ron Perlman (""Nino""), a 59 year old small town mobster who's tired of running the numbers game and just wants to retire in style; Albert Brooks in a stunning performance as a kind of Jeykle and Hyde character, who is both Nino's business partner and who also dabbles as a Race Car Owner; Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) as Gosling's go between/boss at an auto shop, and the very lovely and amazing Ms. Carey Mulligan (Never Let Me Go) as Gosling's love interest and next door neighbor .

Repeat: this is not an action movie.Rather, it's a character study that just happens to contain some visceral action sequences.I want to make that clear right up-front, because I get the feeling that too many of the folks giving this movie one-star reviews walked into the theater with much the same kind of wrong expectations that did the individual who sued this movie's producers upon realizing the flick wasn't a ""Fast and the Furious"" clone.So guess what?  This movie *isn't* a ""Fast and Furious"" clone - and thank goodness for that.  Yes, ""Drive"" has action, and when it comes it can be viscerally graphic (again, unlike the ""Furious"" films, where thousands of cars and bodies are crushed but nary a drop of blood is often spilled).And yet much of the film unfolds in quiet, concentrated bursts of silent lyricism that highlight the interplay between characters.

1509716,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0064NTZJO,C. Sawin,"[5, 7]","Nicholas Winding Refn is a name I had never even heard of until 2009. That's when the action/biography film Bronson was released and I was introduced to both Refn and Tom Hardy. If you know me or have been reading my reviews for a decent amount of time, you've been hearing me rave about Bronson for awhile now. It's a fantastic film that made me a fan of both Refn and Hardy for life. As I'm still working through both of their filmographies (I'm still dying to get to Refn's Pusher trilogy), all of that was put on the back burner for what's happening now in the present. Refn's new film Drive has been unleashed upon the world and sweet monkey-slapping Jesus is it glorious.Driver (Ryan Gosling) has the uncanny ability of making something as simple as driving look like an art form. The things this guy does with a car are unbelievable. He spends the majority of his time working at a garage under the tutelage of Shannon (Bryan Cranston), but Shannon is also his partner. Driver lends his services to robberies to make some extra cash, which is where Shannon comes in. Then there's what Driver does part-time (it's more fun if you find out what that is for yourself). Driver seems to have things under control until he meets Irene (Carey Mulligan); a married woman with a kid whose husband is in prison. Driver begins to spend a lot of time with her and basically falls for her right as her husband is released from prison. That's when things get messy quick and Driver winds up in over his head.Drive was able to get Refn the best director award at Cannes and it's easy to see why. The story is an incredible balance of character development, building tension, and exquisite acts of brutality. The way Refn portrays all of that is pretty astounding. There's this winding perspective that's used several times in the film where we see someone walking down a long hallway or the aisle of a grocery store. It's a continuous shot as we always have our eyes on whoever is making this journey. It's simple, but memorable. The imagery in Drive is also incredible. The violence hits you like a ton of bricks and pretty much comes out of nowhere. There's a scene near the end of the film where Driver is sitting in his car with his shoes splattered with blood. It makes you contemplate whether the character is dead or not; the rich colors, the blazing sun behind him, and the lack of movement. The way Drive constantly parallels The Scorpion and the Frog is just icing on the cake. Everything about the film is just so absorbing.Ryan Gosling is really fantastic in this. He's a man of few words, but is more than happy to illustrate that actions speak louder than anything he has to say. But it's not like he doesn't have dialogue. He's just quiet, but in the way that makes you unsure of what he's actually capable of. Driver is unpredictable and Gosling portrays that really well. Menacing at times and downright scary at others, Driver has the best intentions in Drive even if the way he shows it is a bit unorthodox. It was also great to see Bryan Cranston have a supporting role. As a huge ""Breaking Bad"" fan, it was really entertaining to see Cranston take that intensity that he's known for on the show and bring it into another medium. Ron Perlman treads familiar ground in his performance, but still manages to steal quite a few scenes. Meanwhile, Albert Brooks is just as mesmerizing. He's a businessman first and just wants to do what's right for business, but isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Carey Mulligan is the only one I'm still kind of up in arms about. I swear she just cries in every movie she's in yet she always manages to be a part of really spectacular films, so that has to say something.The car chases are enthralling. I know nothing about cars and generally don't really care too much about them. Popular car movies only appeal to me so much because I'm just not that into cars; plain and simple. Drive was at least able to trigger that interest. You see kids; extreme acts of violence are good for something after all. The opening car chase leaves you craving for more as it's both strategic and captivating. The one later on is a bit more rewarding as metal scrapes against metal and wheels go flying through the air. The violence in this is pretty heavy; blood paints walls on several occasions, there's one of the most graphic head shots ever, and the elevator scene will probably make you curse out loud. It's pretty amazing if you're into that sort of thing, but could be a turn off if you're not.Drive is essentially everything Faster should have been; violent when it needed to be, calm yet intriguing in its slower moments, a fantastic cast all around, and an intriguing story. Its 80s inspired music along with the typeface used in the opening and ending credits makes Drive feel like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City if it was turned into a movie. Drive is an unusual experience that toys with your emotions. It's borderline heartwarming in its first half while sending your adrenaline through the roof during the car chases. Its violent second half leaves you practically gob smacked. Drive is intense, brutal, and explosive. Nicholas Winding Refn and Ryan Gosling have delivered a frontrunner for the best film of the year.",5,Did you hear the one about the scorpion and the frog?,1316044800,"09 15,

He lives in a crappy apartment next to some girl the film director time traveled to 1984 to find and recruit. She is hooked up with some slimy criminal who has a slimy criminal boss. Ryan does a gig with them, because he thinks this 1984 girl is the bomb (SPOILER: she is not).The gig goes wrong! Oh no. Now slimy boyfriend guy is dead and we get this really sweet scene where a girl (not the 1984 girl, sadly) gets her head blown off by a shotgun in slow motion. Ryan pulls some gangsta stuff and kills off slimy boss guy and his slimy other boss friend. He gets shanked in the process and bails. The end. The retro girl is now doomed - the film budget is spent and she is stuck in our timeline, never able to return to 1984 again.Overall my impression was that the film had some cool death scenes that were way more violent than the uber cheesiness of the film's atmosphere seems to warrant. The characters all suck, bad, except for a couple gangster guys who do well considering their circumstances, what with being forced to deal with Ryan's neanderthal character and some of the worst music ever recorded, ever.This film also was a telling omen of the worst film ever created, short of Eraserhead: Only God Forgives.

But then he makes the ultimate mistake: he makes it personal.  And now people have to pay.There's a beautifully misleading simplicity about DRIVE.  It isn't what you think.  Behind Ryan Gosling's emotionless face is a deep well of emotions: anger, disgust, amusement, empathy.  Gosling is perfect in the part, conveying equal parts machismo, rage, and compassion.  He doesn't say much, but he doesn't need to: Driver is a man of action, not words.  As his quasi-romantic interest, Carey Mulligan again dazzles.  With a lesser cast and crew, her role would be shallow, merely there to serve the plot; she makes it three-dimensional, her own.  The same goes for the various supporting players: Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks, James Biberi, and Ron Perlman.  Kudos especially to Albert Brooks, who makes arguably the most plausible charming-to-sadistic transition in recent cinema.  Props must also be given to the ever-steady direction of Nicolas Winding Refn, and the above-par script by Hossein Amini (who penned the unfairly overlooked KILLSHOT).DRIVE isn't a film for everyone.  It's a slow-burning noir in the old fashioned style: an anti-hero who's as much villain as anything; a dame in distress who's really tough-as-nails (but still beautiful and vulnerable); a cast of characters who are mostly unlikable.  It'll certainly be a disappointment to anyone whose short attention span has been captivated by the various FAST AND FURIOUS films.  (You hear about the person who sued because they thought it was an action film?  Wonder if it's the same person who was surprised at how hot their McDonald's coffee was.)

Every single one of them was morally ambiguous (even the damsel in distress seems to have a thing for men who are, or should be, behind bars.) Gosling offers a superb performance, making you care about a character who has neither a name, nor nothing much to say. His actions speak volumes.For the bad - the soundtrack made me want to rip my ears from my head. Rarely do I even take particular notice of movie music, but these songs were particularly grating. The violence is frequent, and gory. I found myself turning away from the screen on more than one occasion, as the camera loved to linger on the aftermath. And lastly, I just felt, in spots, that the film was trying too hard. Even if a guy who looked like Ryan Gosling offered me a ride in his car, I would be creeped out if his main means of communicating was to stare silently at me for long periods of time. Guys, in case you were wondering - this behavior would be more likely to end with a restraining order than a relationship.Overall, still worth watching.

Everything is ""bottled up"" like Brando in ""One Eyed Jacks"": there is volcanic anger lurking always just below the surface. You see this example clearly in the ""noir type"" scene in the diner.

I wondered what I was missing; the film had gotten rave reviews. I paused the DVD and read a few internet comments. One reviewer wrote, ""Skip the first fifty minutes. It's boring. Fast forward to the end with all the interesting killings.""""Drive"" is a nihilistic, sadistic, nasty little film. There are graphic scenes of one man stomping another man to death. The victim's skull is depicted as having the fragility of an eggshell; his brains have the squishy consistency of chocolate pudding. A man places a nail into the forehead of an intended victim and threatens to hammer the nail. A man makes to shake another man's hand and pulls the man forward and slashes his arm open. There are also more conventional stabbings and shootings. I'm used to images of gore; my facebook friends tend to post the latest stoning, decapitation, or bombing videos. What sickened me about ""Drive"" was realizing that Hollywood executives cooked up all this nihilistic sadism as a moneymaking form of entertainment.Ryan Gosling plays The Man with No Name. He drives getaway cars for violent criminals. He develops a crush on Irene (Carey Mulligan) his neighbor. Her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) has just gotten out of prison. Gosling offers to drive Standard in a heist. There are some Jewish gangsters, Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks.None of this is particularly believable or involving. I never forgot that most characters are actors. Oh, there's Albert Brooks, who usually plays a narcissistic whiner, who is now playing an atypical bad guy role. Oh, there's Ron Perlman, who was in Beauty and the Beast. Oh, there's Carey Mulligan, who just played Daisy in ""The Great Gatsby."" Oh, there's Bryan Cranston, from ""Breaking Bad.""It's impossible to believe that Mulligan and Isaac are married, or that Mulligan belongs in this movie at all. She looks like a dewy buttercup; Isaac looks like he could play Satan with no makeup. Mulligan totally lacks that Gloria Grahame feel of a true film noir heroine - beautiful, shopworn, tragic.The film moves very slowly. There is virtually no dialogue between Gosling and Carey Mulligan. The viewer has no idea why this woman breaks into Gosling's heart. You have no idea who Gosling is. He comes across as being too stupid or too smart; too amoral or too ethical; he's just not believable. None of the characters are likeable. This film could have had any number of endings, with everybody dead or everybody alive or the lovers united or the lovers apart, the money in the bank or the money in the backseat of the car.

To anyone who shies away from graphic violence which is realistic, I would say this movie isn't for you. While there aren't a lot of violent scenes here, the ones the movie has are rather brutal. I can't exactly say those looking for great chase scenes will love this either - it has about three fairly short chase scenes, though they were each striking in different ways. The opening scene where we first learn that the driver makes some money as a getaway driver isn't fast-paced but is very unique; it was my favorite scene in the movie because it's not the type of chase you normally see. The driver manages to elude capture using some intelligent techniques.The dialog in the movie left something to be desired. The driver (his character has no name) says little more than a word here and there for half the movie; then he suddenly has a whole lot to say to the people threatening him. The female neighbor he becomes protective of says even less. What I did appreciate about the movie was its direction and style. The director did some interesting things with light which caught my eye at times. I enjoyed the music used and it was integrated well into the story. A few scenes used slow-motion, a technique which gets on my nerves when not done well; however, the director utilized it successfully here. In the end, I liked the style of the movie more than the substance.

All I can say about that is oh well.""Drive"" is a movie about a stuntman/driver who does little ""odd jobs"" on the side which would involve driving a getaway car for robberies, heists, you name it.  And given that premise, you'd think the movie would be entertaining.  Again, you'd be wrong.  The title of the movie should have been ""STARE,"" because that's basically all Gosling's character does--he drives around and stares.  Oh, there's some contrived plot about him falling for his down-the-hall-neighbor (played by Carey Mulligan).  She's sending out all sorts of positive vibes--until her husband is released from jail!  Gosling tries to befriend the guy, and everything that could go wrong, goes wrong.

It's almost unheard-of for the lead in this type of film to be so stoic, contemplative and softly spoken, but in this instance it works magnificently thanks to a deep, powerful performance from Ryan Gosling and a masterful sense of directorial timing. Gosling's nameless wheelman speaks maybe one full page of very limited dialog throughout the picture, but the deliberate way he pauses to contemplate before acting (and the broad range of subtle facial ticks he broadcasts in the process) tells us more than an encyclopedia of dialog could ever manage. Without the rudder of a brash, charismatic lead, the plot often flirts with disarray amid a very loose structural backbone. Ultimately, though, it flows surprisingly well despite those departures, the lull of its often slow, casual pace emphasizing a penchant for sharp, sudden skids into violence.

Like many others, I thought Drive would be more of a simple action film with the center of the story being action shots of chase scenes.  Something like Gone in 60 seconds, or The Fast and the FuriousI couldn't have been more wrong, and glad I am.Drive is a classic.  It's execution makes what is a relatively linear plot into a smooth, dark urban crime drama.  It is atmospheric and sets it's own unique mood that in turn, sets it apart from films of a similar genre that have used the L.A. crime world as their backdrop.  Each scene is memorable, and each character has a genuine, warranted role within the plot.  The music of the film must also be mentioned with high praise, and is by far one of the better I've heard in years.Less is more, and when you take away everything this film could have been, or was expected to be, you are left with a raw, simple, and moving story.  The chase scenes are brilliant, and don't concentrate on mass carnage and speed so much as calculation and delivery.  It's nice to get away from the over the top, regurgitated Hollywood remakes and find a film that concentrates on characters, production and plot as opposed to special effects, empty tough guy talk and cardboard characters.  The violence, when it does appear, is delivered with a swift, realistic brutality...as it should be.  The Cast is top notch, and Ryan Gosseling's performance as a quiet but effective main character is really great.  In a time where films are lacking in character depth and great cinematic craft, Drive gives us hope.  This film and the soundtrack are both highly recommended.DW",5,Beyond expectations,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,1667,"['truly', 'sad', 'how', 'single', 'minded', 'critics', 'are', 'film', 'many', 'others', 'thought', 'Drive', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'simple', 'action', 'film', 'center', 'story', 'being', 'action', 'shots', 'chase', 'scenes', 'Something', 'Gone', '60', 'seconds', 'Fast', 'FuriousI', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'glad', 'am.Drive', 'classic', 'execution', 'what', 'relatively', 'linear', 'plot', 'smooth', 'dark', 'urban', 'crime', 'drama', 'atmospheric', 'own', 'unique', 'mood', 'turn', 'apart', 'films', 'similar', 'genre', 'have', 'used', 'L.A.', 'crime', 'world', 'backdrop', 'scene', 'memorable', 'character', 'genuine', 'warranted', 'role', 'plot', 'music', 'film', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'mentioned', 'high', 'praise', 'far', 'one', 'better', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'years.Less', 'more', 'when', 'take', 'away', 'everything', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'expected', 'be', 'are', 'left', 'raw', 'simple', 'moving', 'story', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'brilliant', 'do', ""n't"", 'concentrate', 'mass', 'carnage', 'speed', 'so', 'much', 'calculation', 'delivery', 'nice', 'get', 'away', 'top', 'regurgitated', 'Hollywood', 'remakes', 'find', 'film', 'characters', 'production', 'plot', 'opposed', 'special', 'effects', 'empty', 'tough', 'guy', 'talk', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'violence', 'when', 'appear', 'delivered', 'swift', 'realistic', 'brutality', 'should', 'be', 'Cast', 'top', 'notch', 'Ryan', 'Gosseling', 'performance', 'quiet', 'effective', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'great', 'time', 'where', 'films', 'are', 'lacking', 'character', 'depth', 'great', 'cinematic', 'craft', 'Drive', 'hope', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended.DW']",N/A

The film does not have enough action to make it an actions flick and the plot line was too predictable to be a true art house and its simply not cynical enough to be a good noir film. What you are left with is a muddled piece of schizophrenic  cinema that at best is a love story with some violent scenes.With that being said let me say that the acting was very good, no qualms about that, but Ryan Gosling's was miscast as the main character. He simply doesn't have the persona  to pull off the tough guy act (a Hollywood stunt driver yes, but a tough guy that will take out a professional paid killer who has a gun with only his hands - no way), however on the plus side he makes Matt Damon as Jason Bourne seem just a little more believable.Some of the biggest problems I had with the film are the almost myriad of goofs, errors, continuity problems and downright slopping filming and editing, combine that with the completely unrealistic portrayal of people and how they react or in most cases under react got to be unbelievably comical so at least this provided some entertainment.  Take for example,  Ryan Gossling T-bones a car doing 40+ mph, launching that car through the air and he doesn't damage the front of his car, the headlights are still on and the engine running. Or the hilarious ""lighthouse"" beam that is focused on the beach not out to sea.Some people complain about the soundtrack, but I thought it worked for the most part. The filming with shadows was nice but that has been done hundreds of times before so it's hardly anything to get excited about.The bottom line is that this film has no redemptive quality, it doesn't make any statement that resonates with reality driven humans, it's not very entertaining to watch, in fact it can be quite slow and boring (the first 40 minutes). Gosling's character is so sedated and yet at the same time deranged that you don't feel much empathy for him. Ultimately this film will appeal to the crowd who wants to appear to be edgy and in and either don't notice or don't care about all of the incongruities. I think a good predictor of if you will like this movie is if you liked Kill Bill, although the stories are nothing alike I saw many similarities (unrealistic, trying to be edgy, .

1509756,A1LTKJ9UTZ9NVI,B0064NTZJO,Filmaholics Anyonymous,"[1, 4]","Believe it. Drive is the best film to come along in a very long time. Not since Pulp Fiction has there been a more passionate love letter to the Cinema. Drive is one of my favorite movies of the sound era and it gives me hope... Cinema may not be completely dead after all.Ryan Gosling stars as the Driver in yet another performance that has helped to cement him as one of Hollywood's top actors. Nicolas Winding Refn directs him with ease. With Drive, Refn has proven himself as one the premier directors of his generation. Drive, along with his previous films like Bronson and the Pusher trilogy, is not necessarily a reinvention of modern cinema, but more or less a reinterpretation of the days of Cinema past. Refn is startlingly good, so good I get goosebumps just from watching his scenes take time and build up. Finally the likes of Scorsese and Cronenberg can take it easy, and Tarantino and the Coens can step aside to make way for the next great talent in film direction: Nicolas Winding Refn.Drive takes its lead from, quite possibly, the coolest film ever made. Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 magnum opus Le Samourai.Refn's creation, the character of the Driver, is cut from the same cloth as Le Samourai's Jef Costello.  The characters share several likenesses, the least important of which being a mysterious and sordid past. The most important likeness being the almost ritualistic way both characters carry out the tasks assigned to them, the lonely lives in which they traverse through a disconnected and oblivious habitat, the trust that doesn't come easy but when it does it is given to a pretty girl who seals both of their fates, and most interestingly, the eyes. Ryan Gosling must have studied Alain Delon's performance as they both seem to communicate most of the plot-points with their eyes and only their eyes. The Driver's real name could easily have been Jef Costello as far as I'm concerned. This is also telling of how many different ways the same film can be so influential to extremely different ends. This polarity is best explored by the movies Drive and John Woo's 1989 The Killer. Both films are flamboyantly open about the debt each owes to the influence of Le Samourai. Where Drive is almost an arthouse action film, the Killer is the exact opposite of that. But influence on either film is unmistakable, Le Samourai wrote the book, and Refn has memorized each and every passage. Yes, it doesn't just stop with Gosling's performance, Drive owes a great deal to Le Samourai in almost every single department. The pacing Refn embraces is classic Melville, the way he tells the story is almost formulaic of a Melville crime picture. Drive, in essence, is an American action film with 60s French sensibilities. People may seem to give Drive too much credit in the originality department, where much of the credit is Melville-deserved. But I don't hold anything against Drive for being almost a reinterpretation Le Samourai. I see Drive for what it was always meant to be, the warmest and most sincere thank you letter to classic Cinema ever filmed. Refn does no hiding when it comes to the Melville influence, its there staring you right in the face. Bravo, Drive, Bravo! Melville would be proud.What is most unique about Drive is the fact that the film is just as much a salute to the French New Wave of the sixties as it is a reimagining of the mainstream American cinema of the eighties. Surprisingly enough, in a film that boasts a very large and formidable Arthouse following, 1986's Cobra, 1985's To Live And Die In L.A., and several other nods to 80s cinema is almost interchangeable with the 60s influence. Where the 60s influence may be much more subtle and much more consistent throughout, the 80s influence is mostly on the surface. The 80s influence in Drive is of the strictly superficial variety, which is both faithful and respectful of the 80s films and techniques certain areas of the film are modeled after. Neon pink title card, synthesizer soundtrack, mood changes, the poster art, and the occasional trademark 80s lighting. Although a caricature like Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti can in fact be found on the surface of the character of the Driver, that is only the surface, it is not the actual substance of the character. The substance of the character is Le Samourai's Jef Costello. Its almost as if the movie's true colors are of the Melville variety, but it masquerades itself as something much more accessible. Drive pretends to be an 80s American action film. But Drive is so much than that, as any semi-educated cinefile will tell you, Drive is film that wears several different masks. Its true identity is that of Melville. And I can't think of a better frame of mind than that.Cast-wise, yes, Albert Brooks steals the show. The character Brooks plays is also one of the only non-french influences on the film. Bernie Ross is wholly American, and that is why he is such a vicious character. Bernie Ross is an 80s action villain, and he is pitted against a 60s character study. The clash is almost inevitable, but the mutual respect is the most rewarding aspect of their relationship. Same can be said about fans of the Arthouse and of the Mainstream. There is a mutual respect there, although all too often these sects of film fans and filmmakers will clash, they are nothing without the other. That said, in theory the rift between Bernie Ross and the Driver can be symbolic of several different things: Mainstream vs Arthouse, Excess vs Conservation, Action vs Meditation, European sensibilities vs American know-how, but most daringly it represents the Death Of Modern Cinema. All the greats are killing each other. Film cannot survive in a climate of servitude to the past. Mainstream wounds the Arthouse, the Arthouse fights back. Both the Mainstream and the Arthouse refuses to let go of their history, therefore they are doomed to tell the same stories over and over again, and cut the other's throat when necessary. The current state of filmmaking is in a very sad state of affairs as of late, Drive is a film that pits over-used caricatures, genres, and eras, popular of modern visual storytelling, against each other, until once everything is done, destroyed, and wounded. All you are the left with are the end credits, and the promise of a stripped down and re-imagined future in filmmaking.Overall, Drive is a perfect film. If you haven't seen it, I recommend that you do so immediately. If you have seen it, I don't care if you liked it or not, WATCH IT AGAIN. This film is trying to communicate the world to you, open up and listen.",5,A Film Of Many Faces,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,6600,"['Believe', 'Drive', 'best', 'film', 'come', 'along', 'very',

The problem is that he feels--and I mean no offense here and this isn't a dig--almost autistic throughout. In quieter moments, Gosling doesn't seem to know what to do with his face, alternately between a goofy smirk and slack indifference. Throughout most of the film, he doesn't really modulate his voice beyond a flat monotone and it's seldom his emotions even reach his eyes.

1509762,A8DDR9M8BPACT,B0064NTZJO,Gary Nackenson,"[1, 2]","Having been surprised by a very bifurcated sentiment on this movie, and having read  some interesting reviews I was moved to write a short review myself. In the most interesting (3 star) review, echoing many reviewer comments about how the two main characters stared a lot and said little, Ryan Gosling is taken to task for not being accessible. In contrast to this take I found the Gosling character to be very emotionally available, especially in his scenes with Carey Mulligan, I can easily see how it could be seen differently. For me, despite the fact that his expressions are taciturn, it feels to me like he gave a lot of affection to the woman and her son with his eyes. Also, it seems to me that the romance is not consummated because the husband comes back, not because of the character's lack of interest.It could be said (and has been by reviewers as well known as the New Yorker's Anthonly Lane) that the main character is a strong silent type clich&eacute;. But I liked the character and Gosling's performance.I was not turned off by the violence as many reviewers were - it seemed like the guy was backed into a corner and had no choice (see History of Violence).I had not picked up on his lack of concern for wearing a blood stained shirt in public.One reviewer called the main character a psychopath. I don't see that.I found Albert Brooks character hysterically funny not because of his lines but because i could not believe that Albert Brooks was playing a mobster.Quibbles:The main character's attitude towards money was mystifying, especially in the ending.As many have noticed there is not that much driving in ""Drive"".

Each person will interpret a book, movie, game, or album in a different fashion, unique to their experience. Therefore, no review (mine or otherwise) is a definitive judgment on a piece of media; it is simply one opinion of many. Please keep that in mind while reading reviews, and do not post angry comments because you disagree with a review's perspective (just because we're hidden by online anonymity does not mean that rules of courtesy do not apply). Level-headed comments or questions are welcome. Customer reviews are my way of making a small contribution to the Amazon community, instead of simply consuming media without offering honest feedback. On to the review:Drive has some moments that are executed magnificently, particularly the opening getaway sequence, which is full of quiet, subdued tension. As ""Driver"" (seriously, that's what he's called... but we'll get to the hackneyed writing shortly) attempted to safely navigate the streets of Los Angeles, with his two paying clients in the backseat, I felt as if I were riding along in the car, with my fingers tightly wrapped around the dashboard. The two thieves sit huddled in the backseat, silent, sweating, their eyes filled with fear, as the car darts from shadow to shadow, evading the pursuing police cruisers and the spotlight of a hovering helicopter. The fact that I was able to sympathize so strongly with the anxiety of these criminals, who I knew nothing about so early in the movie, is testimony to an impressive piece of film making.As the story unfolds, we find that Driver (REALLY, that's his name) is a part time wheel man, while also working as a mechanic and a stunt man in the city. He seems to have no particular direction for his life, but his new romantic interest leads him into a downward spiral of crime, violence, and self destruction.Unfortunately, this movie is held back by juvenile writing. In one scene, Driver actually utters the following line, which is typical of his dialogue (and which made me burst out with laughter): ""How about this... You shut your mouth, or I'll kick your f**** teeth in, and shut it for you!"" At this point, I'm wondering: Who wrote this, a 15 year old boy? I have worked extensively with high school students, and I assure you... this is exactly how teenage boys write dialogue, when they're trying to summon the image of super tough, cool characters who take no guff. What makes this over-the-top lines even harder to swallow is how Driver is generally a silent, moody, nobody-understands-me type of character (again... high school male, anybody?). Furthermore, the scenes where violence comes into play is WAY over the top, to the point where it's just ludicrous, and employed for purposes of shock value, not moving the story forward. Ultimately, this hackneyed approach left Drive a movie that was difficult for me to enjoy.",3,"A bit of ""Blood Simple"", held back by lackluster dialogue",1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,2963,"['Preface', 'Please', 'understand', 'customer', 'reviews', 'reviews', 'matter', 'are', 'purely', 'subjective', 'person', 'will', 'interpret', 'book', 'movie', 'game', 'album', 'different', 'fashion', 'unique', 'experience', 'Therefore', 'review', 'mine', 'otherwise', 'definitive', 'judgment', 'piece', 'media', 'simply', 'one', 'opinion', 'many', 'Please', 'keep', 'mind', 'reading', 'reviews', 'do', 'not', 'post', 'angry', 'comments', 'disagree', 'review', 'perspective', 'just', ""'re"", 'hidden', 'online', 'anonymity', 'not', 'mean', 'rules', 'courtesy', 'do', 'not', 'apply', 'Level-headed', 'comments', 'questions', 'are', 'welcome', 'Customer', 'reviews', 'are', 'way', 'making', 'small', 'contribution', 'Amazon', 'community', 'instead', 'simply', 'consuming', 'media', 'offering', 'honest', 'feedback', 'review', 'Drive', 'moments', 'are', 'executed', 'magnificently', 'particularly', 'opening', 'getaway', 'sequence', 'full', 'quiet', 'subdued', 'tension', 'Driver', 'seriously', 'what', 'called', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hackneyed', 'writing', 'shortly', 'attempted', 'safely', 'navigate', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'two', 'paying', 'clients', 'backseat', 'felt', 'were', 'riding', 'along', 'car', 'fingers', 'tightly', 'wrapped', 'dashboard', 'two', 'thieves', 'sit', 'huddled', 'backseat', 'silent', 'sweating', 'eyes', 'filled', 'fear', 'car', 'darts', 'shadow', 'shadow', 'evading', 'pursuing', 'police', 'cruisers', 'spotlight', 'hovering', 'helicopter', 'fact', 'was', 'able', 'sympathize', 'so', 'strongly', 'anxiety', 'criminals', 'who', 'knew', 'nothing', 'so', 'early', 'movie', 'testimony', 'impressive', 'piece', 'film', 'making.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'find', 'Driver', 'REALLY', 'name', 'part', 'time', 'wheel', 'man', 'also', 'working', 'mechanic', 'stunt', 'man', 'city', 'have', 'particular', 'direction', 'life', 'new', 'romantic', 'interest', 'downward', 'spiral', 'crime', 'violence', 'destruction.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'held', 'back', 'juvenile', 'writing', 'one', 'scene', 'Driver', 'actually', 'following', 'line', 'typical', 'dialogue', 'made', 'burst', 'out', 'laughter', 'How', 'shut', 'mouth', ""'ll"", 'kick', 'f****', 'teeth', 'shut', 'point', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'Who', 'wrote', '15', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'have', 'worked', 'extensively', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'assure', 'exactly', 'how', 'teenage', 'write', 'dialogue', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'summon', 'image', 'super', 'tough', 'cool', 'characters', 'who', 'take', 'guff', 'What', 'over-the-top', 'lines', 'even', 'harder', 'swallow', 'how', 'Driver', 'generally', 'silent', 'moody', 'nobody-understands-me', 'type', 'character', 'again', 'high', 'school', 'male', 'anybody', 'Furthermore', 'scenes', 'where', 'violence', 'play', 'WAY', 'top', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'ludicrous', 'employed', 'purposes', 'shock', 'value', 'not', 'moving', 'story', 'forward', 'Ultimately', 'hackneyed', 'approach', 'left', 'Drive', 'movie', 'was', 'difficult', 'enjoy']",N/A
1509764,A3DMY9EK0ANVDI,B0064NTZJO,Gerald Masan,"[0, 1]","Every moment of Nicholas Winding Refn's 'DRIVE' demonstrates a superb collaboration between director and principal artists, especially with the main character, the Driver, stunningly portrayed by the excellent actor Ryan Gosling. Here is a man who transforms himself from a mysterious character who operates with a kind of stillness and a very simple code,one who doesn't give himself away very often or very willingly,a loner and a drifter who doesn't care if he has any friends,the quintessential rugged American who transitions from this passive state to an incredibly violent and offensive stance.As comfortable driving stunt cars on a movie set by day as he is at night when he's a getaway driver for petty criminals, Gosling's character becomes engulfed in a world infused with tension as he goes up against vicious mobsters [Albert Brooks, who goes completely against type, and Ron Perlman, who has played 'heavies' before] seeking retribution when a heist goes awry.The Driver's love story with his attractive neighbor [Cary Mulligan-&#34;An Education&#34;] pares down to its bare essentials, the subtext revealed more by what the characters DON'T say, but by the way they look at each other. The film has a visceral, muscular quality that Refn applies even to the car chase sequences, which are not the typical high-speed variety one might expect, but instead demonstrate how the Driver uses his intelligence and expertise to achieve his objectives with nonetheless eye-popping results!'DRIVE' is an expertly-crafted tale of compelling characters acting as an ensemble with a consistent tone. The intense and studied pauses are as dramatic as the scenes rife with unmitigated force and violence, and the viewer eagerly follows the Driver, who sports a jacket emblazoned with a scorpion image, as he transforms from a man without any specific life goals, living and breathing by the moment with no game plan, to one who exacts terrifying revenge on the threatening mobsters.

1509767,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0064NTZJO,Grady Harp,"[3, 6]","DRIVE is a fascinating character study, one that uses a minimum of words to define a complex character in a manner than seems terrifyingly quiet and mesmerizing. Based on a book written by James Sallis the screenplay is the  minimalist yet secure writing of Iranian writer Hossein Amini (Wings of the Dove, The Four Feathers, Jude, Shanghai, Kill Shot, etc). Nicolas Winding Refn is the sensitive director who takes advantage of the pauses in the storyline, allowing cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel to bring this mysterious story to life.An unnamed young man referred to as Driver (Ryan Gosling) is a loner, holding down several jobs as a Hollywood stunt driver, a garage mechanic, and a getaway driver who participates in robberies as a silent, by his own rules driver. He works for garage owner, the crippled Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who in turn works for criminals Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman). Driver meets his apartment house neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos) and while there seems to be a chemistry quietly building between them, Driver is told that Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) has been in prison and will be coming home soon.  Driver, Irene and Benicio bond and when Standard is finally released from prison Driver learns that Standard owes a huge protection debt and to befriend the only people about whom Driver cares, he agrees to help in a getaway car that turns very wrong. From this point the normally gentle and quiet driver transforms into a brutal man and the rest of the film is full of terror.Ryan Gosling is splendid in his role as the driver, saying more with his eyes and his body language and his silences than many actors say with a full script.  Carey Mulligan is likewise strong and the supporting roles by Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks, James Biberi and even Russ Tamblyn (!) are superlative cameos.  This is a tough film, full of graphic violence, but it is such a unique story and is so well acted and directed that it is one of the year's most surprising quality movies.

I think it was one of the best movies of the past year. Ryan Gosling's character (who has no name is the movie), is an first class, exceptional driver. Part time mechanic, Hollywood stuntman, and occasional get away driver, his affection for a married woman and her son, belie the violence he is capable of if provoked.  When her husband is released from prison, his feelings for her cause him to try and save her husband from the criminal elements to whom he owes protection money. That's when the story (and the violence), takes off. I thought the movie was as much a love story as it was a tale of violent actions, and murder. A great cast, and Albert Brooks did a convincing job in an unusual role. The sound track was exceptional, and if you don't find the movie as remarkable as I did, you have to admit the music was great.

On the contrary it creates unreal decibels of tension and suspense with an element of the surreal almost if not for the very real levels of menace and violence that venture in to shatter the deadly calm from time to time.  Drive is a very good film on many levels.  The lead character is very interesting to watch. The cinematography borders on the Kubrick-ian at times and to great effect.  Finally, more impressive than the special effects gore that accompanies the violence is the threat of violence which creates the movie's suspense.  Add to that some very good driving/chase scenes and its not hard to see why this movie has its appeal.  Perhaps the only drawback for me besides the annoying theme song ""Real human being"" (we need a theme song to remind us the guy is a hero and a nice guy?) is the ending which somehow doesn't have as much punch as the movie leading up to it. The movie doesn't end on a satisfying note and perhaps its to be expected in a noir thiller such as this movie.  I kind of stopped beleiving in his relationship to the girl by the end..  The violence/gore special effects seems a bit over the top by the end as well.  No matter, I still enjoyed the 90% of the movie leading up to the end and would EASILY recommend this as a great thriller/hot rod movie.  For other movies in the genre also check out the Tarantino favorite ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"" and ""The Driver"" (on which, by the way, this movie seems somewhat based upon).

1509770,A13O1YCZCYT76I,B0064NTZJO,Greg,"[5, 12]","Ugh, this movie...It's weird to try and write a critical review of Drive because soooo many people respond soooo strongly to it.  And, despite what little enjoyment I got out of it, I'm going to have to recommend it.  Because my opinion is so deep in the minority.  Christ, this thing's got a Rotten Tomatoes rating nearly as high as the Godfather...So, yeah, see Drive, I'm sure you'll love it.At it's heart, Drive is a contradiction.  The script is pulled right from late 70's, early 80's action flicks - it's got a very simplistic plot, very simplistic characters (flawless hero?  check.  trophy girl?  check.  muscle villain and brain villain?  check.  wormy sidekick?  check-twice actually!) and was the type of thing that used to get made to showcase awesome spectacle while being stupid fun.  But Drive is also a very modern, slowly paced, art-house film with unique (and weird) visuals, brutal violence, and a downright oppresive soundtrack (I get it, he's a 'real hero, a real human being', turn the music off already).  So what we're left with is an action flick that is just no fun at all.  The tone is so heavy and the violence so brutal and punctuated that the simplistic elements of the script feel hard to swallow.  We don't question Clint Eastwoods man with no name character being good at violence, because everyone in those movies is good at violence and he's just slightly better because he's the good guy and he rules.  But why the hell is this nameless 'Driver', who pointedly doesn't carry a gun and does nothing but drive cars well, so good and efficient at killing?  How come the first (and best) driving scene involves him carefully avoiding the police with skill and subterfuge and the second (and silliest) has him swerving around in broad daylight at high speeds in a world where highway patrol doesn't even seem to exist?  These internal contradictions, not of logic but of STYLE, kept taking me out and would not let me enjoy this movie that seemed to be written for enjoyement but filmed for artistic fulfillment and to make some kind of point about violence.  ...that it's bad?  I'm not sure.  Sometimes it's bad, but sometimes it's awesome?By the way: tangent - the scene in the strip club is amazing and among the best pieces of a movie I've seen in years (and not because fo the nudity, though that never hurts).  It's fluidly paced, the violence is simple and honest and not ridiculous like in the rest of the film, and we see more character there than almost anywhere else.  It's a brilliant, brilliant scene.Moving on, I'd like to come to the crux of the movie and why, I think, many people love it and I do not.  Ladies and gentlemen... Mr. Ryan Goseling.Goseling's talent in the past has been creating specific, unique, emotionally available characters... which is not at all why he's in this movie.  He's in this movie because he's popular right now and because he's gorgeous.  Ten years ago, this movie would have starred Brad Pitt.  Ten years before that, Patrick Swayze.  Before that, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, et al.  He's the chin du jour, the GQ man of the hour.  It doesn't hurt that he's a good actor, but here he's being used as a blatant 'blank slate' for the audience to project themselves upon.  In the very first scene he's painted as super awesome, super efficient, flawless and nearly invincible - yet he has nearly no facial expression and no real opinions on anything (so you can inject your own).  Guys instantly want to be him. In the second scene, in the grocery store, we see him be meak and awkward around people - especially women (still no real expressions or opinions, again, to not get in the way of the audience injecting their own).  The ladies in the audience instantly imagine themselves as the only person to truly appreciate him, and they want to wrap him up and take him home because no one will ever understand him like they do and blah, blah, blah, sweaty sex fantasy.(I'm making gender generalizations here, and I apologize.  It's just faster.)I could go on for hours about how these two character types don't exist in the same person outside of BS action movies, but it really doesn't matter.  Drive has just delivered the protagonist one-two punch: turned an attactive and popular masturbation fantasy actor into a (potentialy) univerally acceptable blank slate character.  If the movie has you emulating with a character you've created in your own head, you're going the have a good time.  The next 90 minutes just need to be interesting to look at and marginally cohesive.  Which, in all fairness, they are.And this is where Drive failed to grasp me.  I had no interest in projecting anything on the Driver character.  I wanted to see an interesting character study, because the opening scene let me know I wasn't getting a mindless action flick (which, again, is fine - that opening heist scene is amazing).  But I don't get that either... so what do I get?A mediocre flick with good visuals and modest performances that's neither fun nor thought provoking, but one that everyone around me will say is brilliant and unique and timeless and blah blah blah sweaty sex fantasy.  It's not a bad movie, not by any stretch.  But I have a hard time swallowing it as something special.But, yeah, see Drive.

Like his bald-headed rival he gets into trouble when distracted by a woman and is hurled into a plot involving gangsters and hitmen. While Louis Leterrier's French thriller tried so hard to be Hollywood, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn's LA-based thriller tries very hard to be European, and takes the viewer on a ride down a lost highway.At the same time it also comes across as a secret remake of Walter Hill's The Driver. All of these films are very, very similar, but Drive is the best of them. It's difficult to comprehensively review the movie as it is very minimalistic and focuses more on atmosphere and the quiet moments in between dialogue rather than action and twists. It's a wonderful movie to look at though, and I do want to complain about how problematic the morals and values of the unnamed 'Driver' are, but if it is the intention to make him morally ambiguous then I guess it is successful. It doesn't make for a great character regardless of how smooth Gosling plays him.The violence is harrowing and brutal, as it is in real life. Nicolas Winding Refn seems to understand that there is no action in real life, there is only violence, and it's brutal and ugly and not something any sane person wants to happen to them. In this respect it is far more grown-up than The Transporter but cannot be praised as being a 'better' film as it is still sold on style and visuals. The substance takes a back seat and the movie apologetically delivers what it wants without feeling the need to scream for attention. I have to respect it for that.Shot in ProRes 4:4:4 the movie looks great in 2.35:1 1080p. The blacks are gorgeous and the daylight scenes look just brilliant. It sounds just as good in DTS HD-MA.

1509792,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0064NTZJO,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 7]","In this day and age of disposable $100 million films, and films working ridiculously hard on creating not much more than a strong opening weekend, many filmmakers and film audiences forget that like all forms of art, cinema has its own language. What takes five paragraphs to write in a book can be shown in five seconds of a film, and the same works in reverse. Also in this day and age, films tend to get pigeon-holed into three categories; the first two being the most immediately recognizable: The Popcorn-Munchers and The Oscar-Bait. They're easy to recognize.The third are what I refer to as The Dump films. Basically, these are films that will get a wider audience than a limited-release film, but they're generally released in the weakest parts of the year with no expectation of big box-office or great critical acclaim; months like September, most of October, January and February are loaded with Dump Films, so it was no surprise to me that a film like Nicolas Winding Refn's DRIVE was released in September. It was a film with actors rather than stars, and a film that was more of a throwback to the great psuedo-independent crime thrillers of the 1980's (such as MANHUNTER and THIEF, both of those films from Michael Mann who also helped to define TV in the 80's with MIAMI VICE and CRIME STORY, and TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. from Mann's fellow Chicagoan William Friedkin) rather than the high-octane FAST AND FURIOUS flash-over-substance film that one very disgruntled audience member thought it would be and took her outrage to unintentionally satirical heights by suing DRIVE's distributor for the cost of her ticket as well as asserting the film also had Anti-Semitic views and still intends to file a class-action suit against ""false advertising"". I include this anecdote mostly because I think the gall it takes to do something like this is beyond astounding, but also because I believe this woman represents most of the viewing public who saw this film.Looking at the public's reviews of this film, it's very much a love-it-or-hate-it film. Many viewers assail the film for being too slow, too boring, and even in some cases, too graphic. Critical acclaim has been nearly universal for the film. It was one of the best reviewed films of 2011 alongside films like THE ARTIST and THE MUPPETS, but not as successful as either of those films, commercially or Oscar-y. The reason being that DRIVE is not a safe film. There isn't a moment that is antiseptic or commercial. It's not meant for mass consumption, and perhaps that explains its own devisive nature as a film. But DRIVE is not afraid to put some of the onus on the audience and tell us, quietly, to expand our ideas of what a great film is and how not only can a picture be worth a thousand words, but a glance or look can be worth a thousand emotions, and the harshness of a sound can be predicated on the silence that precedes it.Without going too much into plot or character, it's important to give credit where credit is due. Ryan Gosling, the too-dreamy-for-words heartthrob of films like THE NOTEBOOK and CRAZY STUPID LOVE who is also the risk-taker of HALF-NELSON, THE BELIEVER, LARS AND THE REAL GIRL and THE IDES OF MARCH, is perfect as the nameless super-anti-hero of the piece. Every look, every glance, every gesture has purpose. The greatest acting talents are the performers who can speak volumes just by saying nothing at all, and this film is loaded with those performers. I call Gosling's character a super-anti-hero because there is something superhuman about this character. He can do just about anything he wants physically, and he can survive just about any assault, except for the emotional. And that's where Carey Mulligan comes in. Mulligan is by far one of the greatest young actors out there. She first really showed us that in AN EDUCATION, and continued to show it in NEVER LET ME GO, SHAME, and this film. She is picture-perfect innocence. You want to protect her, and you understand The Driver's urge to do so. Bryan Cranston, with the introduction of BREAKING BAD a few years ago, has been a revelatory performer. Who knew the dad on MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE would be one of TV's best serious actors? Not me. And his performance as the other half of the partnership with Gosling is small yet shining. Oscar Isaac as the doomed husband of Mulligan's character plays his ex-con with an immediacy and desperation and sense of inevitability. Ron Perlman as the small-time thug with delusions of grandeur is just pitch-perfect, proving once again that Perlman is a seriously underrated actor. Christina Hendricks is sultry, sexy and that's really all her role requires, which is sad, because I love her. However, the film, from a performance standout, belongs to Albert Brooks. We're used to Brooks playing the nebbish, awkward yet smarter-than-you character. We've seen it since MODERN ROMANCE, and through LOST IN AMERICA, BROADCAST NEWS and others. For Brooks to turn that image on its head and play the lethally efficient and pragmatically violent small-time crime boss Bernie Rose is beyond inspired casting, and the performance he turns in is as strong and chilling as seeing someone like Pacino or De Niro play a similar role. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor but not for an Oscar. In fact, infuriatingly, DRIVE was only nominated for one Academy Award: Best Sound Editing, which if you watch the film closely, it REALLY deserves, but it lost to... whatever; probably TRANSFORMERS or something.The other shining star of this film is director Nicolas Winding Refn. Being somewhat unfamiliar with his work prior to this film, I tried to watch the ultra-surreal BRONSON with Tom Hardy, and couldn't get through it from a narrative standpoint but appreciated its bravura. I haven't seen his other film, VALHALLA RISING yet, but plan to watch it very soon. It's probably more his film than any of the performers: His use of every element of the language of cinema is so deftly handled, from the sound to the picture to the editing to the performers, he achieves cinematic perfection. The film works on every level it's supposed to: Crime Thriller, Fairy-Tale Romance, Emotional Drama, Anti-Heroic Action, it does it all flawlessly. Another unsung hero of this film is Cliff Martinez, who does the Tangerine Dream-esque score for the film as another nod to those classic 80's thrillers.The simple fact of DRIVE is that this film was the purest expression of the language of cinema that came out of 2011. It never missed a moment to capitalize on that language, and it speaks it fluently and perfectly. This is, hands down, the best film of 2011.",5,THE BEST FILM OF 2011.,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,6671,"['day', 'age', 'disposable', '100', 'million', 'films', 'films', 'working', 'ridiculously',

Critics agreed that James Sallis ""may be one of the best mystery writers that most readers have never heard of"" (Knight Ridder Tribune). In DRIVE, he combines murder, treachery, and payback in a sinister plot resembling 1940s pulp fiction and film noir. The story is told through a complex, cinematic narrative that weaves back and forth through time and place.Producers Marc E. Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review of it in Publishers Weekly. The Driver intrigued Siegel because he was ""the kind of character you rarely see anymore - he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it."" The character interested Platt because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.Marc Platt Productions released DRIVE in 2011 as an American arthouse action crime drama film directed by Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn. Like the book, the film is about an unnamed Hollywood stunt performer who moonlights as a getaway driver for criminals.STORYLINE: The Driver (Ryan Gosling) is a mysterious man who has multiple jobs as a garage mechanic, a Hollywood stuntman and a getaway driver. He has no name and no signs of any real personal life. He barely speaks and rarely shows any real emotions. The cars the Driver uses are provided by his mentor and boss, Shannon (Bryan Cranston) a crippled, washed-up body shop owner. Shannon wants to borrow money from Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks), a movie producer/loan shark/local gangster to invest in a racecar that he wants the Driver to race. A side story involving Driver and a neighbor (Carey Mulligan) with a young son may seem a detraction...but a mutual attraction develops and is woven into the plot effortlessly.... even when the neighbor's husband is released from prison.The movie is well cast. Gosling plays the flawed loner well. Albert Brooks is brilliantly cast out of the box as the Bernie Rose, money man, a tough gangster....The film of DRIVE is a very nice character study. A quiet action film with no shaky handheld cameras or loud noises....except the roar of a well tuned engine. At the end our hero drives off into the sunset without the girl. In a fast car....not on a horse.This is one example when the movie may be better than the book!",4,Gosling excels as James Sallis' unnamed driver and flawed loner...,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,2526,"['When', 'American', 'crime', 'writer', 'James', 'Sallis', 'wrote', 'DRIVE', 'standalone', 'novel', '2005', 'had', 'written', 'six', 'well-received', 'detective', 'novels', 'featuring', 'Lew', 'Griffin', 'Critics', 'agreed', 'James', 'Sallis', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'mystery', 'writers', 'most', 'readers', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Knight', 'Ridder', 'Tribune', 'DRIVE', 'murder', 'treachery', 'payback', 'sinister', 'plot', 'resembling', '1940s', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'film', 'noir', 'story', 'told', 'complex', 'cinematic', 'narrative', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'place.Producers', 'Marc', 'E.', 'Platt', 'Adam', 'Siegel', 'Marc', 'Platt', 'Productions', 'optioned', 'novel', 'Siegel', 'read', 'review', 'Publishers', 'Weekly', 'Driver', 'intrigued', 'Siegel', 'was', 'kind', 'character', 'rarely', 'see', 'anymore', 'was', 'man', 'purpose', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'apologies', 'character', 'interested', 'Platt', 'reminded', 'movie', 'heroes', 'looked', 'up', 'child', 'characters', 'typically', 'portrayed', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Clint', 'Eastwood.Marc', 'Platt', 'Productions', 'released', 'DRIVE', '2011', 'American', 'arthouse', 'action', 'crime', 'drama', 'film', 'directed', 'Danish', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'book', 'film', 'unnamed', 'Hollywood', 'stunt', 'performer', 'who', 'getaway', 'driver', 'criminals.STORYLINE', 'Driver', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'mysterious', 'man', 'who', 'multiple', 'jobs', 'garage', 'mechanic', 'Hollywood', 'stuntman', 'getaway', 'driver', 'name', 'signs', 'real', 'personal', 'life', 'barely', 'rarely', 'real', 'emotions', 'cars', 'Driver', 'uses', 'are', 'provided', 'mentor', 'boss', 'Shannon', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'crippled', 'washed-up', 'body', 'shop', 'owner', 'Shannon', 'borrow', 'money', 'Bernie', 'Rose', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'movie', 'producer/loan', 'shark/local', 'gangster', 'invest', 'racecar', 'Driver', 'race', 'side', 'story', 'involving', 'Driver', 'neighbor', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'young', 'son', 'may', 'seem', 'detraction', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'develops', 'woven', 'plot', 'effortlessly', 'even', 'when', 'neighbor', 'husband', 'released', 'prison.The', 'movie', 'well', 'cast', 'Gosling', 'flawed', 'loner', 'well', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'box', 'Bernie', 'Rose', 'money', 'man', 'tough', 'gangster', '.The', 'film', 'DRIVE', 'very', 'nice', 'character', 'study', 'quiet', 'action', 'film', 'shaky', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'loud', 'noises', 'roar', 'well', 'tuned', 'engine', 'end', 'hero', 'off', 'sunset', 'girl', 'fast', 'car', '.not', 'horse.This', 'one', 'example', 'when', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'book']",N/A

The criticism falls into 2 main categories and 2 lesser categories, which I will address one at a time:- Silence / lack of dialogue: People are judging the acting based on the dialogue having awkward pauses, because this is not a dramatic tool that is common in the average modern ""chatterbox"" film, but it's clearly present in nearly all of Clint Eastwood's films. Even in ""Grand Torino"" it was important that he be stoic and not be too talkative. Modern films would lead us to believe there are no quiet characters in the real world. If you are a restless person who cannot stand the ""silent type,"" then please avoid watching this film or dropping negative reviews about it. It pays homage to Clint Eastwood, but also to Marlon Brando. ""Apocalypse Now"" was a very poetic film that really needed every single awkward silence to build the tension of it's poetics. ""Drive"" also pays homage to the silent villain of the original Halloween (especially in the scene when he's standing on the hill overlooking the beach), an homage that also carries-over into the next category.- The gore: I am not a fan of gory films, and I would have liked this film better with four less stomps to the head, so I'm shocked that one reviewer said Goslin's character was more teddy bear than psycho. Again, I do not like gore at all, and I still give this film a strong five stars. The gore is done in a style that I hesitate to call a grind-house homage simply because it's not the Kill Bill style where blood squirts halfway across the room, but it's also not shot in the slick resolution style of Final Destination. The gore style is more like Halloween than Evil Dead, but it has that dry dead-pan camera angle that never looks away when things get rough. The presence of violence is helpful to the story somewhat like ""There Will Be Blood,"" in order to give the impression that this guy has either been corrupted by circumstance, or secretly had a hidden psycho in him. Also, it counterbalances the idea that he is supposedly heartfelt and fighting for someone.Now for the lesser concerns:- Not enough driving: Are you seriously complaining about this? Do people really watch movies just because they have a lot of driving? I guess so. Then please by all means skip this and rent ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (more driving than there is plot) or ""Furious Five"" (I hear it is the best driving movie, which is why it doesn't interest me). This movie starts and ends with driving and that leaves out at least three chase scenes, but I guess people wanted the killing to happen in cars, the romance to happen in cars, etc. Get over it. It's like complaining because people have sex in a movie called ""The Opposite of Sex.""- The music: I guess if the music is what drove me to this movie in the first place, then it's only logical that it would be the factor that drove some people away. I would complain that it could use even more corny 80's-type synthesizer music. The actual soundtrack only has like six songs or so and the rest is just the composer's score of mood-evoking tones and what not. I would have preferred if Dust Brothers had handled the composer parts to give it more grit like they did on Fight Club, but it works regardless. The music goes with the ""Risky Business"" font used in the title credits and it goes with the character's jacket and gloves.Closing remarks: This is not really the ""crossover film"" it was portrayed to be, it's still mostly an arthouse type of film, but the cameras are not shaky, the violence is not cartoonish like Tarantino's style, and the scenes are not shot through dirty windows and stuff like my dad hates. This is a film that builds on the lineage of gangster films, suspense-type film noir, etc. It's only on the edge of the driving movie genre, but a film that the males in my family can all get behind, because it ties back to Reservoir Dogs, Scarface, and The Godfather. This is nothing like the high-pace/soft-violence of ""Gone in 60 seconds.""",5,LETS CUT TO THE CHASE (no pun intended),1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,4227,"['somewhat', 'understandable', 'many', 'viewers', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'when', 'movie', 'homage', 'older', 'films', 'chances', 'are', 'last', 'films', 'saw', 'were', 'recent', 'ones', 'not', 'older', 'ones.This', 'main', 'crime', 'who', 'developed', 'distaste', 'film', 'criticism', '2', 'main', 'categories', '2', 'lesser', 'categories', 'will', 'address', 'one', 'time', 'Silence', '/', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'People', 'are', 'judging', 'acting', 'based', 'dialogue', 'having', 'awkward', 'pauses', 'not', 'dramatic', 'tool', 'common', 'average', 'modern', 'chatterbox', 'film', 'clearly', 'present', 'nearly', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'films', 'Even', 'Grand', 'Torino', 'was', 'important', 'be', 'stoic', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'talkative', 'Modern', 'films', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'are', 'quiet', 'characters', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'restless', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'silent', 'type', 'then', 'please', 'avoid', 'watching', 'film', 'dropping', 'negative', 'reviews', 'homage', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'also', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'was', 'very', 'poetic', 'film', 'really', 'needed', 'single', 'awkward', 'silence', 'build', 'tension', 'poetics', 'Drive', 'also', 'homage', 'silent', 'villain', 'original', 'Halloween', 'especially', 'scene', 'when', 'standing', 'hill', 'overlooking', 'beach', 'homage', 'also', 'carries-over', 'next', 'category.-', 'gore', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'gory', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'better', 'four', 'less', 'stomps', 'head', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Goslin', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'teddy', 'bear', 'psycho', 'Again', 'do', 'not', 'gore', 'still', 'give', 'film', 'strong', 'five', 'stars', 'gore', 'done', 'style', 'hesitate', 'call', 'grind-house', 'homage', 'simply', 'not', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'style', 'where', 'blood', 'halfway', 'room', 'also', 'not', 'shot', 'slick', 'resolution', 'style', 'Final', 'Destination', 'gore', 'style', 'more', 'Halloween', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'dry', 'dead-pan', 'camera', 'angle', 'never', 'away', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'rough', 'presence', 'violence', 'helpful', 'story', 'somewhat', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'order', 'give', 'impression', 'guy', 'either', 'been', 'corrupted', 'circumstance', 'secretly', 'had', 'hidden', 'psycho', 'Also', 'idea', 'supposedly', 'heartfelt', 'fighting', 'someone.Now', 'lesser', 'concerns', 'Not', 'driving', 'Are', 'seriously', 'complaining', 'Do', 'people', 'really', 'watch', 'movies', 'just', 'have', 'lot', 'driving', 'guess', 'so', 'Then', 'please', 'means', 'skip', 'rent', 'Gone', '60', 'Seconds', 'more', 'driving', 'plot', 'Furious', 'Five', 'hear', 'best', 'driving', 'movie', 'why', ""n't"", 'interest', 'movie', 'driving', 'out', 'least', 'three', 'chase', 'scenes', 'guess', 'people', 'wanted', 'killing', 'happen', 'cars', 'romance', 'happen', 'cars', 'etc', 'Get', 'complaining', 'people', 'have', 'sex', 'movie', 'called', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'music', 'guess', 'music', 'what', 'drove', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'only', 'logical', 'would', 'be', 'factor', 'drove', 'people', 'away', 'would', 'complain', 'could', 'use', 'even', 'more', 'corny', ""80's-type"", 'synthesizer', 'music', 'actual', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'six', 'songs', 'so', 'rest', 'just', 'composer', 'score', 'mood-evoking', 'tones', 'what', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Dust', 'Brothers', 'had', 'handled', 'composer', 'parts', 'give', 'more', 'grit', 'did', 'Fight', 'Club', 'regardless', 'music', 'Risky', 'Business', 'font', 'used', 'title', 'credits', 'character', 'jacket', 'gloves.Closing', 'remarks', 'not', 'really', 'crossover', 'film', 'was', 'portrayed', 'be', 'still', 'mostly', 'arthouse', 'type', 'film', 'cameras', 'are', 'not', 'shaky', 'violence', 'not', 'cartoonish', 'Tarantino', 'style', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'shot', 'dirty', 'windows', 'stuff', 'dad', 'film', 'lineage', 'gangster', 'films', 'suspense-type', 'film', 'noir', 'etc', 'only', 'edge', 'driving', 'movie', 'genre', 'film', 'males', 'family', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Scarface', 'Godfather', 'nothing', 'high-pace/soft-violence', 'Gone', '60', 'seconds']",N/A
1509799,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0064NTZJO,Jason,"[3, 8]","So Ryan Gosling is a stunt driver who commits himself to criminal clients.  Without condition, for a designated amount of time.  Miss the window and he's out.  So he's a lot like a cable repairman who breaks the law with his inside industry knowledge - like when you used to be able to splice coax and get free cable if you palmed the installer a $20.  Anyway, Gosling helps out a friend and neighbor, an ex-con neighbor, who needs a getaway driver for what appears to be a simple heist.  Problem: Mob involvement.  From there it's drive, smolder, drive, murder, drive, retaliation, drive,Twilightstaring contest, drive, staring contest redux, drive ambiguously into the sunset.The story is taut, simple, and engaging at times.  Casting and acting is strong primarily because of the supporting roles turned in by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman.  Beyond that, however, I don't see what everyone is so hyped up about.  The film starts slowly, has minimal buildup, has nearly nonexistent character development, and rides gingerly along the frail path of a nearly mute connection between Gosling's character and a cute neighbor.  For a character drama, Drive severely lacks on character, dialogue, and any semblance of credible character connection.  There were enough awkward pauses and silent stares that I looked at the credits to see if William Shatner was involved.To be quite honest, the one aspect of the film that has any meat is the one aspect rarely discussed.  There is a decent amount of action, blood, and violence for it to satisfy the amateur gore-hound, but since all that is discussed is the artsy film noir nonsense with slow, sweeping camera angles of the gritty LA landscape, designer clothing displays with slicked back hair and satin jackets, and extraneous toothpick wiggles from an actor who looks less than half as tough as his character is supposed to be, there is no wonder the truly gripping parts are overlooked.Ultimately Drive ends up constricted by the same elements that have caused so much critical fanboy dog-piling.

The movie kicks off with a slightly suspenseful non action getaway sequence. No explosions, no gunfire. It shows how smart this guy is at getting away when compared to other movies like the Transporter and Driver with Dwane Johnson.The movie has an 80s vibe from the pink cursive text, to the synth pop music in the background to the star Ryan Gosling's scorpion jacket. It is a really nice vibe... but now for the negative. A lot of the movie, probably the first hour is acting through standing there motionless and saying nothing. There were a few times that I thought my DVD player had stopped. Nope it's just them standing there doing nothing. No camera movement at all.For the most part, the story follows Ryan's life outside of being a getaway driver and his boss who gets a stock car funded by two mob men played by Ron Pearlman and Albert Brooks. The driver meets his apartment neighbor, an attractive woman with a kid. He falls for her even though she has a husband in jail. The driver even appears to be out of the getaway driver game without bluntly stating ""that's it I'm out,"" like other movies. I'm sure you can guess what happens. The husband gets out and then there is a twist that brings Ryan back into the driver life for one last score. That's when I feel like the movie really begins... an hour into it.This has a low budget when compared to other driver movies like the Transporter and it seems like most of the budget went to funding brutal scenes of when someone is killed. Very nice and graphic. Shocking for a movie that has zero motion and movement. Maybe that's what the film makers thought... we want to bore people as much as possible so that when we show brutal scenes of violence they take notice of them!Overall, it is probably not even worth a watch due to how slow it is for the first hour. Even after it picked up it is still pretty slow even if it is graphically violent.

It's partially my own fault because the preview made it look more like an action movie then it really was.  Had I been privy to what it that information, I might have had a better experience.  However, I understand the marketing aspect of getting an expanded demographic into the theater as well, and I know why they made it look that way.  But in any case, I would expect a movie called Drive to have a little more...well, driving.  The movie is good, don't get me wrong, but a more accurate moniker might have been, `Drive...a little'.  To be more open minded, let me say that the dramatic aspect was very good.  There were elements that really let the actors shine and the script was good.  It plays out like a 70s action flick that Steve McQueen might have done.  The plot centers on a young part time stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver.  He befriends a young single mother in his building and makes an attachment with her 7 year old boy.  When her convicted husband is released from jail and comes back to re-enter her life, he steps aside only to find out that the husband is still in debt to a local mob boss.  In an effort to help the mother and her son, he offers to help him pull off a job that will wipe out his debt.  Unfortunately, the deal goes south and things get ugly from there.  Drive is a crime drama, hands down.  And in that guise it plays out beautifully.  Ryan Gosling plays the role of The Driver with cold determination and few words.  He lets his mannerisms and facial cues do the acting.  It's subtle and very effective for the character.  The mood throughout the movie is dark and desperate.

1509815,A3RB6NQOLOBXYD,B0064NTZJO,"Jimmy Lee ""James""","[4, 7]","I have to give credit where credit it is due and that certainly goes to Director Nicolas Winding Refn.Nicolas Winding Refn makes the most of ever dollar in this exceedingly tight budget film. I was not familiar with this director nor even the actors, except for maybe one Ryan Gosling film I saw years ago (The Notebook). The simple plot intrigued me not to mention I am biased for lone wolf characters. Nicolas takes us on a personable journey through Los Angeles with the aid of a reticent and introverted Driver. (Ryan Gosling) He is a man who abides by a simple code; he gives you 5 minutes flat, and he doesn't carry a weapon. In those 5 minutes he is yours and yours only, but outside of that, you are on your own. Viewers will be given his sense of style from the very opening scene. He manages to stay calm and collective while avoiding potential danger at every turn. He can handle the road; he can handle a car; he can also handle pop music all too well. He is also a stunt driver for Hollywood films and a very good mechanic too. Imagine that.The driver is good at what he does, at least in so far as driving is concerned, but when it comes to fulfilling an emotional emptiness in his life, he drives to the wrong exit. In his desolate apartment complex we are introduced to the driver's neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son. The driver befriends this family after her car breaks down not to far away from the auto body shop he works at. The driver's voluble manager, Shannon, (Bryan Cranston) offers a ride to Irene and persists that the driver will get her home safe. Quickly enough, the driver confides with Irene and her son and frequently spends time with them. Not surprisingly, a deeper connection ensues. It is not until Irene's husband returns from prison that we feel the emotional tension intensify from a V6 engine to a V8, but never diving below that V6 feel. The driver's love for this family does not abate but only grows when the husband is beaten badly in the garage of the apartment complex. He owes protection money to the mob. It is here that the Driver breaks his code and helps Irene's husband. Unintentionally, he also familiarizes himself more than he would like with local mobsters such as Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman).Drive is incredibly well paced and I tend to disagree with all the surrounding clamor that it is slow in the beginning. This is far from the truth. I feel Nicolas was very much in control in how he maintained such a consistent feel of uneasiness throughout the film. He knew exactly when to take it up a notch and smoothly level it down to tame his audience gently. I thought the relationships were plausible enough to service the simple plot and add substance too. I'm not so sure what kind of a connection some critics were looking for but I felt the interactions were realistic. The chemistry was satisfying overall. Ryan Gosling's character was not very multi dimensional and it didn't need to be. He is a loner, plain and simple; no family, no friends and maybe a few enemies ? Ultimately, he is very mysterious but also very explosive, especially when it comes to protecting his neighbor. He is entertaining to watch. The rest of the cast is also serviceable; Albert Brooks pulls of an unapologetic mobster role as well as Ron Perlman. The style and presentation is quite unique. Moreover, the car chases are brilliantly choreographed to perfection; sounds and colors are pleasing to the eyes and ears and the violence is appropriately delivered. Nicolas reignites a once dominate American auto industry in the way he presents these distasteful and bulky hunks of metal; Ford and Chrysler should pay Nicolas royalties for making their cars look so darn good.I never overlook a film's score and in this particular case, Cliff Martinez scores a masterpiece from start to finish. Martinez weaves together an electronic 80's pop soundtrack that dominates the opening and ending scenes and adds his own personal and eery flare that is so central to Ryan Gosling's character. He enhances the desolation that is so prevalent in the Los Angeles landscape. The Driver's internal feelings are remarkably correlated to every vibrating moan that is released from Martinez's dominate usage of the synthesizer.  The subtle but eery sounds create a quite atmosphere of curiosity and danger in this beautiful and highly stylized film.",4,Nicolas Winding Refn makes even American cars look Stylish.,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,4408,"['have', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'certainly', 'Director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn.Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'most', 'ever', 'dollar', 'exceedingly', 'tight', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'director', 'even', 'actors', 'maybe', 'one', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'film', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'Notebook', 'simple', 'plot', 'intrigued', 'not', 'mention', 'am', 'biased', 'lone', 'wolf', 'characters', 'Nicolas', 'personable', 'journey', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'aid', 'reticent', 'introverted', 'Driver', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'man', 'who', 'simple', 'code', '5', 'minutes', 'flat', ""n't"", 'carry', 'weapon', '5', 'minutes', 'yours', 'only', 'are', 'own', 'Viewers', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'sense', 'style', 'very', 'opening', 'scene', 'stay', 'calm', 'collective', 'avoiding', 'potential', 'danger', 'turn', 'can', 'handle', 'road', 'can', 'handle', 'car', 'can', 'also', 'handle', 'pop', 'music', 'too', 'well', 'also', 'stunt', 'driver', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'very', 'good', 'mechanic', 'too', 'Imagine', 'that.The', 'driver', 'good', 'what', 'least', 'so', 'far', 'driving', 'concerned', 'when', 'fulfilling', 'emotional', 'emptiness', 'life', 'wrong', 'exit', 'desolate', 'apartment', 'complex', 'are', 'introduced', 'driver', 'neighbor', 'Irene', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'son', 'driver', 'family', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'not', 'far', 'away', 'auto', 'body', 'shop', 'driver', 'voluble', 'manager', 'Shannon', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'ride', 'Irene', 'driver', 'will', 'get', 'home', 'safe', 'Quickly', 'enough', 'driver', 'Irene', 'son', 'frequently', 'time', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'deeper', 'connection', 'ensues', 'not', 'Irene', 'husband', 'returns', 'prison', 'feel', 'emotional', 'tension', 'intensify', 'V6', 'engine', 'V8', 'never', 'diving', 'V6', 'feel', 'driver', 'love', 'family', 'not', 'abate', 'only', 'when', 'husband', 'beaten', 'badly', 'garage', 'apartment', 'complex', 'protection', 'money', 'mob', 'here', 'Driver', 'breaks', 'code', 'Irene', 'husband', 'Unintentionally', 'also', 'more', 'would', 'like', 'local', 'mobsters', 'such', 'Bernie', 'Rose', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Nino', 'Ron', 'Perlman', '.Drive', 'incredibly', 'well', 'paced', 'tend', 'disagree', 'surrounding', 'clamor', 'slow', 'beginning', 'far', 'truth', 'feel', 'Nicolas', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'control', 'how', 'maintained', 'consistent', 'feel', 'uneasiness', 'film', 'knew', 'exactly', 'when', 'take', 'up', 'notch', 'smoothly', 'level', 'down', 'tame', 'audience', 'gently', 'thought', 'relationships', 'were', 'plausible', 'enough', 'service', 'simple', 'plot', 'add', 'substance', 'too', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'connection', 'critics', 'were', 'looking', 'felt', 'interactions', 'were', 'realistic', 'chemistry', 'was', 'satisfying', 'overall', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'loner', 'plain', 'simple', 'family', 'friends', 'maybe', 'few', 'enemies', 'Ultimately', 'very', 'mysterious', 'also', 'very', 'explosive', 'especially', 'when', 'protecting', 'neighbor', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'serviceable', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'pulls', 'unapologetic', 'mobster', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'style', 'presentation', 'quite', 'unique', 'Moreover', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'choreographed', 'perfection', 'sounds', 'colors', 'are', 'pleasing', 'eyes', 'ears', 'violence', 'appropriately', 'delivered', 'Nicolas', 'once', 'dominate', 'American', 'auto', 'industry', 'way', 'distasteful', 'bulky', 'hunks', 'metal', 'Ford', 'Chrysler', 'should', 'pay', 'Nicolas', 'royalties', 'making', 'cars', 'look', 'so', 'darn', 'good.I', 'never', 'overlook', 'film', 'score', 'particular', 'case', 'Cliff', 'Martinez', 'masterpiece', 'start', 'finish', 'Martinez', 'together', 'electronic', '80', 'pop', 'soundtrack', 'opening', 'ending', 'scenes', 'own', 'personal', 'eery', 'flare', 'so', 'central', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'character', 'desolation', 'so', 'prevalent', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'landscape', 'Driver', 'internal', 'feelings', 'are', 'remarkably', 'correlated', 'vibrating', 'moan', 'released', 'Martinez', 'dominate', 'usage', 'synthesizer', 'subtle', 'eery', 'sounds', 'create', 'quite', 'atmosphere', 'curiosity', 'danger', 'beautiful', 'highly', 'stylized', 'film']",N/A

Looked fairly action packed. Well, it was, in the trailer as that's all you get. The lead actor is appealing, if you like the moody, silent type. I would bet his lines were less than 100 words and when he did speak it was after long pauses. The movie starts off agonizingly slow after the initial chase scene, which was, in itself lacking emotion. Long scenes of the lead actor and plain Jane lead actress just looking at one another, not saying much. What they saw in each other is unexplainable. There was one scene of the lead actors face where I thought the bluray was actually frozen. It lasted about 15 seconds, close up of his face, and then he blinked. What was this director thinking? Are we supposed to fill in the void? How?  Were we somehow supposed to build a character based on these boring shots, or was this just ""artistic"" and I missed it. Albert Brooks does a good job as the baddy and there are some well done, yet very graphic scenes of violence. This is NOT an action movie, but belongs in some art house where you can sit over a latte and tell me just what the hell was the point. The ending left me saying, ""huh?"".

1509821,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,B0064NTZJO,J. O. Booker,"[5, 10]","I had been sitting on the fence a while with this one. Been reading the reviews here and the extreme differences over those who either love or hate it told me that there was probably more to it than its surface suggests, still I wasn't sure about buying it. That is, until I'd spoken to this person I know who'd seen it a couple of weeks ago. She didn't really care for it much and this settled it for me until I got a moment of clarity and came to my senses and realized whose opinion I was asking. Her favorite films: Love and Basketball; Madeas (all of them); anything with Mark Wahlberg; Glitter; that new one with 50 Cent; Nicholas Cages' films, etc. In other words, films that drop an F-bomb every five minutes or a film made on a level that a 5 year old can appreciate like Transformers.To make a long story short, after she told me she didn't like this film (Drive) I immediately went out, got it, and fell in love with it. Should've known. Some people you have to go to the opposite of when it comes to taste and when they say they don't like something that's usually a tip-off that it's good.This film is a throwback in that the stars, and not the cars, are the humans and to my eye there are no cgi gimmicks to speak of. I won't get into the plot because that's been done here already but I will agree that the film and its star evoke the same tight, custom-fit, leather racing glove feel as McQueen's Bullit. And like McQueen's character in that film, Gossling in this one is as brooding, cool, and low-key.There's a very brief (but unbelievable) car chase that gives a sly wink to Bullit involving a Mustang and a Chrysler, both newer models. This film does have its share of action but it fits the situations they erupt from. And when I say erupt I do mean that word literally. It's not wall to wall action but it is VIOLENT with a capital V and there's a big difference between the 2. But Drive is not the Fast and The Furious. It's not about the cars.

For a movie called &#34;Drive&#34; I expected at least one inventive car chase. There are two short car chases, if you want to call them that, and they simply don't deliver. Third, Gosling's character simply isn't explored, which is a huge problem considering that his and Mulligan's character have zero chemistry. Muted, supposedly longing gazes at each other, don't make for acting here, or anywhere for that matter. Finally, why is Christina Hendricks even listed in the credits?

1509833,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0064NTZJO,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[40, 48]","With so many films still to come this year, it can be safely said that Drive is one of the best films of 2011. I am so ecstatic about this film that I'm struggling to write about it with any coherency, afraid that I may stray into ranting and raving about how great it is. Seeing a great film (hopefully) isn't a rarity, but seeing a great film of this caliber doesn't happen too often. Rarely have I left a theater so eager to turn around and watch the same movie again, my only fear being that it couldn't possibly be as good the second time. Drive shares commonalities with last year's The American with George Clooney. Both were wide releases, marketed as action films that completely defied the expectations of their audience. The biggest difference between the two is that people went to see The American expecting an action film and were treated to alienating, slow-moving, art house fare. Drive lacks the art-house pretentions of The American and those who see it expecting an action film will be treated to something much more hypnotic and memorable than they expected. I saw Drive in an all-male, half-full theatre. Before the film began, they talked loudly with each other but went completely silent once the film began and didn't seem to move an inch until the end. Even those who are likely the target demographic for the Transformers movies were not immune to the spell this film casts.The opening sequence is one of the best in recent years. It quietly introduces its unnamed protagonist (Ryan Gosling), the Driver, and establishes his skills as one. The sequence has no dialogue except for the police transmissions over the radio, yet few scenes are as gripping and suspenseful as this one. The Driver works for Shannon (Bryan Cranston) at his car garage, getting occasional work as a movie stuntman by day. By night, he occasionally operates as a getaway driver with a strict set of rules. The Driver is neither talkative nor effusive and has no back-story nor does he require one. Whether the Driver has any capacity for emotion isn't apparent until he meets his neighbor Irene (a stunning Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio. The three grow close, but Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) soon returns from prison. This is the catalyst for the real meat of the plot, where everything goes against expectations and Drive descends into shocking violence. It's common in modern films to have a character-driven first half and a second half driven by action and violence, which is, thankfully, not the case here. The film does reveal a violent nature, yet it bleeds into this second half with purpose.Directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, best known for directing the Tom Hardy-vehicle Bronson, this film netted Refn the award for Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. With a solid script as a foundation, Refn's direction is what makes this film the experience it is. It's an exercise in style that's never too flashy or too obvious. Drive is a ""throwback film,"" spawned from various influences to create something wholly original. The protagonist is similar to Clint Eastwood's archetypal Man with No Name, the driving scenes bring Bullitt to mind, the credit font recalls Risky Business, the music recalls 80s action films, and the cinematography and overall pacing bring French cinema to mind. Its influences are eclectic and blatant, yet this is not a film that relies on these influences to illicit recognition from viewers. Drive is not an easy film to categorize, making its wide release an act of bravery on the studio's part. Even in the composition there's a bravery rarely seen in modern cinema today. You don't often see a ""mainstream"" film that works as heavily with extended silences, hearkening back to a time where you didn't need to spell everything out to the audience. There are long passages of silence in, absolutely no CGI in the driving scenes, and minutes into the film I was hooked. It was apparent to me that I loved this film only twenty minutes in and not a moment where I doubted this initial assessment. Drive takes risks and pulls them off flawlessly. This is a film with scenes of (literally) heart-pounding suspense and (potentially) nauseating violence that moves with such a poetic force you're afraid to blink for fear of diminishing its effect. When watching a movie I am always aware that I'm sitting in a movie theatre, but Drive is an immersive experience that draws you into the atmosphere it has created on screen and once it gets ahold of you, it doesn't let go.Gosling is a powerful force, portraying the Driver mostly with facial expressions, physical mannerisms, and a quiet conviction. He speaks only about twenty sentences in the film and his performance validates that he's one of the great young actors working today. To think this is the same actor from Crazy, Stupid, Love only a couple months ago is mind-boggling. Gosling was robbed of an Oscar-nomination for his heartbreaking work in 2010's Blue Valentine, but his performance is so pitch-perfect that he'll be hard to ignore this time. Also on Oscar-watch is Albert Brooks, known as a comedic actor, who defies the laws of typecasting with his terrifying performance as a Jewish mobster. Brooks is scary good in this role, nearly unrecognizable and truly terrifying. He should be a shoo-in. Ron Perlman also surprises, delivering a strong performance that begs for more roles in bigger movies.Drive eventually reaches a stunning emotional climax that is a product of its editing as well as its execution. This is a film with a strong sense of direction, setting out to be something and never apologizing for itself or conforming to mainstream Hollywood rules. This is the most surprising film to come out of Hollywood this year, bar none. Surprising because it can be found at your local corporate cinema and surprising because of how unassumingly it sneaks up on you. Drive is a powerful, poetic, moving, existential cinematic experience that far exceeded my expectations and will undoubtedly be one of the ten best films of 2011. Few films say so much by saying so little.GRADE: ABefore seeing Drive, I had somehow avoided all promotional materials for it. I had heard good things since it premiered at Cannes, but I had not seen a trailer nor read any reviews. Having watched the trailer after seeing the film, I urge you to avoid it. The trailer depicts Drive as an action film and will ultimately bring more people to the theatre, but it also spoils nearly every surprise and almost every scene. While the biggest surprise of Drive is how different it is from how it's depicted in the trailer, which doesn't reveal even a hint of the film's tone, your ignorance to the contents of the trailer will leave your viewing experience rewarded.",5,Stunning; Easily One of the Best Films of 2011,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,6775,"['so', 'many', 'films', 'still', 'come', 'year', 'can', 'be',

He does more with less than any actor I have seen.  Drive is the perfect vehicle for his minimalism.  His entire script for the film is probably no more than a page or two.  He doesn't even have a name.  He is The Driver - a Hollywood stunt driver by day who moonlights driving getaway cars.  His style is best described as smart and unbelievably cool.  So we are surprised when The Driver reveals that he is capable of a wide range of roles, depending on what is called for, from lover and benefactor to brute and killer.  The true existential hero, he leaves you wondering, ""Who is this guy?""

He has three jobs, Hollywood stuntman, auto mechanic and the coolest, nerves of steel getaway car driver for criminals this side of Steve McQueen (The Getaway). The kid meets Irene (Carey Mulligan) who has a son and a husband in prison. When Irene's husband gets out of prison he owes the gangs a lot of money for the protection they provided in prison and want him to rob a pawn store to pay off that debt. Driver offers him his services as a getaway car driver for the robbery, but after the robbery goes awry nothing is as it seems and its hard for driver to know who he can trust or should trust.Ryan Gosling is absolutely great as driver, he doesn't say much and doesn't need to say much, but his face, while being cool and reserved, communicates a lot of the feeling behind his eyes. Albert Brooks plays a former Hollywood producer, Bernie Rose, who now makes a living as a mobster with a heart. His partner Nino, played by Ron Perlman is the dirtier side of the mob.

He's a loner, no friends, only human connection is his boss, Cranston's character Shannon. Gosling is such a loner his character doesn't even have a name, he's just the driver. He makes human connections with his seemingly single neighbor and her son. This is why I gave it four rather than five stars. Mulligan isn't really single. She says her hubby is in jail yet she still goes out with Gosling? And who is watching her son when she's out cruising? And how can she afford that apt. working as a waitress? A common movie mistake -- home well out of a person's salary range. Oh wait, I also gave it four of five because it has intrusive, cheesy 80s style music.

1509842,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0064NTZJO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[229, 287]","In a year in which Ryan Gosling could do no wrong from romantic comedy (Crazy, Stupid, Love) to political drama (The Ides of March) to this art house actioner--""Drive"" stands as the apex of his career-changing film streak. I have, for many years, declared Gosling perhaps the best actor of his generation. Ever since he burst onto the film scene in the controversial ""The Believer,"" Gosling has eschewed being a mainstream ""star."" Heck, after ""The Notebook,"" another actor might have taken a very different career path. But Gosling, despite a couple of disappointing forays into big budget Hollywood, has remained true to his indie roots. Until now, that is. This year, he seamlessly blended indie cool with mainstream appeal. Of course, in ""Drive"" he found the perfect filmmaker and artistic collaborator in Danish auteur Nicolas Winding Refn. The two began a very public bromance and have already embarked on their next film project (2012's Only God Forgives). Winding Refn is an ultra-cool writer/director whose resume is populated by some of my favorite international hits, and he picked up the Cannes Best Director prize for this. If you are unfamiliar with his work, I strongly suggest you invest in ""The Pusher"" trilogy--a series of films exploring the underbelly of the Copenhagen drug scene.Well that's a lot of build-up to ""Drive."" But here's the thing, I'm not going to elaborate very specifically on this movie. Anyone who reveals too much is doing the movie a complete disservice. It is a film that is best left to unfold at its own pace with all surprises intact. The movie makes the most of its seedy Los Angeles setting. Gosling plays an unnamed stuntman who gets a sideline job working for a crime syndicate boss, played by an uncharacteristic Albert Brooks. All I will say is that things take an unexpected turn, and Gosling morphs from a virtually silent protagonist into a stone cold nightmare. It's an exciting transformation and one that will linger with you. This is modern noir at its finest, but with a decidedly art-house vibe.  It combines an edgy urban seventies sensibility with the man-with-no-name western allure. I think many expected ""Drive"" to be a car movie or a non-stop action picture, but it is essentially a slow-burn character driven piece about how far one man can be pushed. But make no mistake, it continues to ramp up to extreme proportions before the blood soaked finale.The filmmaking is top-notch throughout. There is an exquisite use of light, shadows, neon shadings, and arresting street level views of Los Angeles which make the visual appearance of the film quite spectacular. The odd techno-pop soundtrack is unorthodox, to be sure, but somehow fits perfectly. The editing and camera work is assured and edgy at the same time. And the effects are brutal and unforgettable. Add to that a great cast, and ""Drive"" becomes a can't miss proposition. Gosling shows a different side here, but the performance everyone will talk about is served by Brooks. Brooks paints one of the most memorable villains on screen this year, completely against type, and will probably be looking at serious awards consideration. Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks help round out the cast. ""Drive,"" ultimately, may not be for everyone and that's OK. Winding Refn has put together a near perfect film for adult audiences. If you check your expectations at the door, don't read spoilers, and settle in (oh and it helps if you aren't particularly squeamish)--this is a ride well worth taking.

After a heist intended to pay off Standard's protection money spins unpredictably out of control, Driver finds himself driving defense for the girl he loves, tailgated by a syndicate of deadly serious criminals.

1509851,A1OE5SI8PQDZK4,B0064NTZJO,L.C.,"[4, 7]","Clearly, not a film for everyone. From beginning to end, the story unfolds at its own pace. If you're just just looking for a ""movie for guys, who like movies"" with rapid-fire action sequences, then be forewarned that this isn't a ""Fast and the Furious,"" ""Shoot 'Em Up,"" or Van Damme-type non-stop, adrenaline-pumped action flic. It doesn't fit neatly into either the action or the drama genre. Definitely a cult classic, though. Some driving scenes. No gun battles or high-speed, explosive car chases, but cleverly done, none the less. Some gruesome kill scenes, without a rain of bullets or extended hand-to-hand combat scenes. Best to know what to expect. If you don't like full-frontal, horrific kill scenes, skip this one. It's not that there's too many. It's part of the story. Don't bother asking why the ""The Kid"" did it that way. It's a kill or be killed scenario. Think fast. Use what's available at hand RIGHT NOW or die. As to the scene in the elevator that ends with Irene standing in the parking garage, looking back at him, I understand his rage in that elevator scene -- it was for everything that he almost had, everything that might have been, everything that he will never have, hence the raw brutality in his actions with her baring full witness. There's a quiet, unique ""romance"" between Irene (Mulligan), & ""The Kid"" (Gosling), but no steamy sex scenes. If you need romantic leads to verbally declare their intentions, spell out their past lives, future dreams, & emotions thru dialogue, you'll be sorely disappointed. Drive is NOT diaglogue-driven.  Irene & ""The Kid's"" lives are simple, & their feelings for each other are pure & simple. No on-screen declarations. It's called ACTING. Everything is conveyed through scant dialogue. Irene's young son is only part of the attraction between them. You'll need to understand what's not said, and pay attention to their multi-layered, nuanced emotions conveyed thru body language, facial expressions, & time spent together in a few, frugal scenes. We loved Gosling's intensity throughout. It drew us in & kept us riveted. The acting held us there, not dialogue or requisite love scenes. We don't need to know ""The Kid's"" name, his history, where he came from, or what made him that way. It's not relevant to the story that played out before us, which relied on the connection between Irene & ""The Kid"" to drive the movie to its final conclusion. Gosling reeled us in & convinced us of every intention thru his posture, the grit of his jaw, & that fleeting glint in his eyes that alternately conveyed tenderness, & unmistakable, dangerous resolve. He doesn't represent ""every man."" Most people will never meet anyone like him. You can't know him. You don't get to know him. He never revealed anything. That's the whole point and the beauty of it, because he made us understand what drove him. It was all done in the name of protecting what he had come to love. We've always been Gosling fans, & this only served to solidify his talent. If you liked ""Lars and the Real Girl,"" you'll like this more, though there's no similarity between ""Lars"" & ""The Kid's"" characters -- the similarity lies in Gosling's uncanny ability to fully inhabit the role of his character.

(The trailer gives away several of Drive's surprises.) I only knew my best friend begged me to see it so that she would have someone to discuss it with. I can never resist pop culture that I might be able to dissect with someone.Drive is obviously influenced by the 80's, from the neon pink credits to the synthpop soundtrack and score that brings to mind classic soundtracks like Thief done by Tangerine Dream. It is a shame that Cliff Martinez's score wasn't eligible for the Academy Awards, because the music in Drive works beautifully. (Apparently there was too much non-original material, which doesn't really make sense to me, since Ludovic Bource's score for The Artist was eligible. It contains music by Duke Ellington and others, as well as using the Vertigo score. Good music, but you can't say it was all written for the movie.)In addition to great music, the cinematography of Drive will knock your socks off. It's a beautiful movie. Well edited, too. Many have accused Nicolas Winding Refn's film of being too technical and cold. I find his precision appealing and enjoyed the characters, good and bad, too much to consider the film cold.Drive's cast includes Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaacs, Ron Perlman, and Christina Hendricks. It's a long list of recognizable names used well. While Drive is set in Los Angeles, you'll never feel that anyone looks too Hollywood. You might not believe this if you've seen the trailer, but the acting is subtle. These are not people who wear their emotions on their sleeves, but that doesn't mean they aren't being driven by their passions.If you like movies with chase scenes, you might find Drive frustrating at first. Refn goes for something more real than constantly exploding cars.

Not sure if the current crop of movie critics are even old enough to remember him or his quiet adrenaline-fueled films. Pretty surprising to see a whopping 93% tomato rating - screams limited background and experience.Why?Director Nicolas Refn is pretty much directing straight off the Mann playbook; from shot sequence, set-up/framing, timing, choice of actor/acting style, and the all-important electro-synth soundtrack. Even the opening sequence Mistral font is a throwback to the late 80s-mid 90s when Mann was at the his peak of creativity.Ryan Gosling does a pretty good James Caan in 'Thief', and I appreciate that Carey Mulligan stands on her own skill alone, nice.

1509863,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B0064NTZJO,M. Bullions,"[5, 11]","Last year, there was a film called ""The American"", that was distributed by Focus Features, and had George Clooney in the role of a hitman who had lost his way, and was hiding out in a gorgeous Italian landscape, waiting to go on one last mission. This was something of an art film. It meant to be subtle, and emotional, and beautiful, and at the same time, somewhat surprising.It did none of these things. I tend to be the occasional film snob, enjoying the kind of film that relies on subtlety, rather than either laughs or violence, or something like that, that the average audience is more likely to enjoy. However, I hated ""The American"". Nothing happened in it. It was dull and boring, and too snooty for even me to enjoy.I mention all of this, because ""Drive"", a film I saw yesterday, was fantastic. It displayed exactly what ""The American"" was going for, but missed completely. This is a fully realized version of that movie. One reason why ""The American"" failed, is because I am completely tired of George Clooney. He's had his time in the spotlight, and that was one of his weakest performances.However, Ryan Gosling is the heartbeat of ""Drive"". He's charismatic, charming, sexy, and one hell of an actor. You never know where his character is going to go, and that's what this movie wants of its audience. His charm isn't something easily accomplished, he becomes his character, like only the best actors do.""Drive"" follows an unnamed man, who is a stuntman for Hollywood movies. On the side, he moonlights as a getaway driver. He never works for the same person twice, and works anonymously. He falls in love with a woman (Carey Mulligan) who lives in his apartment building, whose husband (Oscar Isaac) is in prison. Somewhere in the film, Jewish mobsters (Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman) become involved in the story, threatening the lives of everyone.The story is a slow-burner, taking awhile to set into affect. However, that's the way it should be. Unlike ""The American"", the story eventually does go somewhere, and it has an ending that packs a huge punch. Unlike many action films that I've recently seen, it has undeniable style. It has a Tarantino-esque feel, and a look that separates it from a lot of other similar films.It has a somber, and melancholic feel, and yet has many ""gasp"" moments. Its final act is unforgettable. Storylines overlap, and crash together in an almost classical way. It is definitely not for the faint of heart, though, as quiet moments in the film are broken by moments of brutal violence. However, that's one of the things that makes this film so good.However, there are a few moments that lag the pacing, somewhat. A few things could have easily been cut out, because they don't bring the story along at all. But that doesn't hurt the overall product. Once you see how it ends, it more than makes up for its flaws.Grade: B+",4,"A somber, melancholic thrill ride.",1324684800,"12 24, 2011",2011,2869,"['Last', 'year', 'was', 'film', 'called', 'American', 'was', 'distributed', 'Focus', 'Features', 'had', 'George', 'Clooney', 'role', 'hitman', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'way', 'was', 'hiding', 'out', 'gorgeous', 'Italian', 'landscape', 'waiting', 'go', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'was', 'something', 'art', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'beautiful', 'same', 'time', 'somewhat', 'surprising.It', 'did', 'none', 'things', 'tend', 'be', 'occasional', 'film', 'snob', 'enjoying', 'kind', 'film', 'subtlety', 'rather', 'violence', 'something', 'average', 'audience', 'more', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'However', 'hated', 'American', 'Nothing', 'happened', 'was', 'dull', 'boring', 'too', 'snooty', 'even', 'enjoy.I', 'mention', 'Drive', 'film', 'saw', 'yesterday', 'was', 'fantastic', 'displayed', 'exactly', 'what', 'American', 'was', 'going', 'missed', 'completely', 'fully', 'realized', 'version', 'movie', 'One', 'reason', 'why', 'American', 'failed', 'am', 'completely', 'tired', 'George', 'Clooney', 'had', 'time', 'spotlight', 'was', 'one', 'weakest', 'performances.However', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'heartbeat', 'Drive', 'charismatic', 'charming', 'sexy', 'one', 'hell', 'actor', 'never', 'know', 'where', 'character', 'going', 'go', 'what', 'movie', 'audience', 'charm', ""n't"", 'something', 'easily', 'accomplished', 'character', 'only', 'best', 'actors', 'do', 'Drive', 'unnamed', 'man', 'who', 'stuntman', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'side', 'getaway', 'driver', 'never', 'same', 'person', 'twice', 'anonymously', 'love', 'woman', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'apartment', 'building', 'husband', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'prison', 'Somewhere', 'film', 'Jewish', 'mobsters', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'become', 'involved', 'story', 'threatening', 'lives', 'everyone.The', 'story', 'slow-burner', 'taking', 'awhile', 'set', 'affect', 'However', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'American', 'story', 'eventually', 'go', 'somewhere', 'ending', 'huge', 'punch', 'many', 'action', 'films', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'seen', 'undeniable', 'style', 'Tarantino-esque', 'feel', 'look', 'lot', 'other', 'similar', 'films.It', 'somber', 'melancholic', 'feel', 'yet', 'many', 'gasp', 'moments', 'final', 'act', 'unforgettable', 'Storylines', 'overlap', 'crash', 'together', 'almost', 'classical', 'way', 'definitely', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'though', 'quiet', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'broken', 'moments', 'brutal', 'violence', 'However', 'one', 'things', 'film', 'so', 'good.However', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'lag', 'pacing', 'somewhat', 'few', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'story', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'overall', 'product', 'Once', 'see', 'how', 'more', 'up', 'flaws.Grade', 'B+']",N/A

1509868,A3Q07NIIS6V2CT,B0064NTZJO,"Mia N. Searles ""The Muses Circle""","[11, 16]","Drive completely caught me by surprise. Based upon the trailer and plot summaries such as the one above, I went into the movie thinking it was going to be just another typical action film along the lines of Fast and the Furious and The Transporter. I couldn't have been more wrong. Ryan Gosling plays a character only known as ""Driver"". By day he is a stuntman driver in movies and works on cars at a shop owned by his only/older friend named Shannon. At night he offers his services as a getaway driver to clients who need speedy exits after unsavory activities (such as robbing places). The opening sequence is set up by Driver's simple rules:""There's a hundred streets in this city. You don't need to know the route. You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. No matter what. Anything happens a minute either side of that and you're on your own. Do you understand?""The chase scene that follows is unlike anything I've ever experienced before in an action car film. As the driver starts to navigate his clients through the dark streets with the police following behind, I was sitting there waiting for Ryan Gosling to start spewing cheesy one liners that Vin Diesel or Jason Statham and other action stars have become famous for. I was waiting for the suspenseful music to start pumping. I was waiting for---SOMETHING familiar to happen on the screen. Instead, the scene was done in almost complete silence, except for the sound of the police through his scanner and his own car radio. This technique built suspense way more than the normal high speed chases we see in movies. I found myself holding my breath at every turn. Talk about intense!While the opening sequence was an amazing chase scene, the rest of the movie plays out more like a drama with the main focal point on characterization. Driver is a lonely, introverted man that seems to only feel alive when he is doing dare devil stunts on movie sets or taking the risk of getting caught every time he accepts a ""getaway"" side job at night. The feelings he develops for Irene and her son are foreign to him--driver's background is never really revealed in the movie, but you get the impression that he had an unhappy childhood or rough upbringing that has molded him into the man we see onscreen.Although many people think the elevator scene is the turning point in the film (and in many ways it is) for me it's the motel scene with Christina Hendricks' character, Blanche. Up until then we know him as a lonely, under-the-radar type character. But this new development shows that he is an angry man, that under that cool exterior is suppressed rage just waiting to be unleashed.There were a few things going on in this film that had me a bit confused. However, I eventually made peace with these issues once I connected the dots. Driver had a distinct jacket with a scorpion emblem on the back. He rarely takes it off, even when it's covered in blood and he walks onto one of the movie sets in front of people. I at first thought that was a bit unrealistic but after watching this movie a 2nd time, I realize that Driver is not your normal man. I'm not saying he is supernatural or anything like that, but he definitely has some hero-esque qualities about him. Like Superman with his cape, Driver has his jacket.The music and font chosen for the credits were two other oddities that had me scratching my head at first. There was a lot of pop songs in the movie done in the style of the 80's or early 90's-- definitely not something you would expect out of an action film. The font at the beginning and end credits is done in cursive and is a hot pink color. Again, let me remind you, this is not your typical action movie.My only major gripe with this film is the very long periods of silence. I know this sounds weird and it's hard to describe what I mean but there are many scenes where Driver and Irene just stare at each other-- or Irene would ask him a question and it would take him forever to answer back. This goes on a lot during the film and may be annoying for some viewers who have short attention spans. I won't lie, it even annoyed me the first time around because I put the movie on real late at night and had trouble with keeping my eyes open during those scenes. BUT, I do GET it. I know this was purposely done by the director. There are moments of awkward silence and just when you think nothing is going on and let your guard down, all hell breaks loose. Someone is shot, or stabbed-- you get the point. So in a way, you are rewarded for your patience.

Mctighe ""MMcTighe""","[4, 9]","Drive is a unique film which I'm not surprised alienates some viewers, specifically due to it's slow Hitchcock-esque build up and lack of traditional movie dialogue. Hence why I love this movie. That and the remarkable beauty in every frame.I think before anything is said of the director, the script and the acting something must be said for Ryan Gosling. Ryan delivered one of the single best acting jobs I have ever seen. The way he uses his eyes and face to subtly convey that inner drive beneath his bland exterior is nothing short of amazing. You know he's crazy, you're just waiting for the suspicion to be confirmed and when it is the result is mind blowing. It's one of those performances that shows just how different Ryan Gosling can be, and just how much range he will have as an actor.Ryan Gosling is added by a very sharp and derivative script. The script does away with most dialogue, and cuts everything down to basically what is necessary. In a way it very much resembles real life. When movie characters open their mouths you expect very over the top things to come out, bits of dialogue that would otherwise be awkward if uttered in real life. In this movie, it uses the awkwardness of very real life exchanges to create tension you can cut with a knife.The script itself is not very deep though. I struggle to figure exactly what the moral is, but honestly I never thought the movie needed one. It finds other ways to stick with you long after you've finished it.I think some people are accustomed to movies being a certain way, and this movie certainly dares to be different.

Director Nicholas Winding Refn effectively uses scenes of silence instead of cliched dialogue to illustrate the love story; subtle changes in lighting; a retro-sounding musical score that was actually written between the years 2007-2011.The script avoids many standard cliches regarding stereotyped ex-cons, mobsters, villains, etc.  The Driver's anonymity and his abrupt comfort with violence makes his character intriguing.  The cast is excellent:  Ryan Gosling (so good in ALL GOOD THINGS) is both appealing and disturbing in his enigmatic role; Carey Mulligan is sweetly heartbreaking as Irene; Albert Brooks is amazing as the vile but likeable villain; BREAKING BAD's Bryant Cranston is excellent as best friend Shannon; Oscar Isaac is good as the doomed Standard; Christina Hendricks is an adequate conspirator and Ron Perlman is just perfect as another nasty mobster.DRIVE is definitely Oscar material but sadly garnered only one technical nod.

1509872,A1VNYP0RD6VXIX,B0064NTZJO,"Michael Hogan ""Constant Reader""","[1, 2]","Drive to me was one of those movies that I saw the previews for and thought I'd eventually see.  Essentially, however, I forgot about it until I was looking for a movie to watch the other night.  I decided to watch it, mainly because it was ""free"" as part of a streaming subscription.  I'm glad I finally watched this movie.The first ten minutes or so has little dialogue, and it's mainly the main character (Gosling) doing his job as a for-hire getaway driver.  It's a great scene as the movie focuses on the driver's method of listening to police radio, watching traffic, and showing off his driving skills.After that, the first half of the movie is quiet, almost maddeningly so.  The Driver seems to be somewhat uncomfortable outside of working in a garage and stunt-driving, which are basically his jobs outside of being a getaway driver.  He meets his neighbor and her son when her car breaks down, and the scenes with him and her conversing are almost awkward.  He says very little and seems to be unsure of himself, very much the opposite of how sure he is as a driver.Just as the Driver and Irene are getting close, she tells him that her husband is coming home from prison.  True to his character, the Driver doesn't say anything, doesn't change his facial expression.  There is a very tense moment when the Driver meets the husband, Standard, in the hallway.  You get the feeling that Standard can be a mean guy.Once the Driver finds out that Irene and her son are in danger due to some people who are after Standard, he steps in to be the getaway driver for a heist during which Standard will get the money to pay off those after him and his family.  It's at this point where the movie goes from quiet to very violent, almost without warning.The last half of the movie is a 180 from the quiet, subdued first half.  We learn more about the characters of Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, and a surprising Albert Brooks.  It seems that the Driver is more than meets the eye as he takes on some nasty people while trying to protect Irene and her son.  There's a scene in an elevator that is one of the most violent I've seen in a long time; a scene in which we see a very different side of the quiet Driver.There's a buildup to a final confrontation between the Driver and the nasty folks.  Much blood is shed, and the body count rises.  Overall, what happens is both cringe-worthy and satisfying.This is very entertaining movie with some great performaances by Gosling, Cranston, Perlman, and Brooks.  As I mentioned, the shift in the film from quiet to violent happens in a matter of seconds.  Everything the Driver does is to protect Irene and her son, and the first part of the movie is necessary to see why he does what he does.I recommend this movie, and I encourage anyone who watches it to pay attention to the first half.  Don't let the quiet, subdued theme fool you.",4,Quiet...and Then Violent Film,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,2879,"['Drive', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'saw', 'previews', 'thought', ""'d"", 'eventually', 'see', 'Essentially', 'however', 'forgot', 'was', 'looking', 'movie', 'watch', 'other', 'night', 'decided', 'watch', 'mainly', 'was', 'free', 'part', 'streaming', 'subscription', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'watched', 'movie.The', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'little', 'dialogue', 'mainly', 'main', 'character', 'Gosling', 'doing', 'job', 'for-hire', 'getaway', 'driver', 'great', 'scene', 'movie', 'driver', 'method', 'listening', 'police', 'radio', 'watching', 'traffic', 'showing', 'off', 'driving', 'skills.After', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'quiet', 'almost', 'maddeningly', 'so', 'Driver', 'be', 'somewhat', 'uncomfortable', 'working', 'garage', 'stunt-driving', 'are', 'basically', 'jobs', 'being', 'getaway', 'driver', 'neighbor', 'son', 'when', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'scenes', 'conversing', 'are', 'almost', 'awkward', 'very', 'little', 'be', 'unsure', 'very', 'much', 'opposite', 'how', 'sure', 'driver.Just', 'Driver', 'Irene', 'are', 'getting', 'close', 'husband', 'coming', 'home', 'prison', 'True', 'character', 'Driver', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', ""n't"", 'change', 'facial', 'expression', 'very', 'tense', 'moment', 'when', 'Driver', 'husband', 'Standard', 'hallway', 'get', 'feeling', 'Standard', 'can', 'be', 'mean', 'guy.Once', 'Driver', 'out', 'Irene', 'son', 'are', 'danger', 'due', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'Standard', 'be', 'getaway', 'driver', 'heist', 'Standard', 'will', 'get', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'family', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'quiet', 'very', 'violent', 'almost', 'warning.The', 'last', 'half', 'movie', '180', 'quiet', 'subdued', 'first', 'half', 'learn', 'more', 'characters', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'surprising', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Driver', 'more', 'eye', 'nasty', 'people', 'trying', 'protect', 'Irene', 'son', 'scene', 'elevator', 'one', 'most', 'violent', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'scene', 'see', 'very', 'different', 'side', 'quiet', 'Driver.There', 'buildup', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Driver', 'nasty', 'folks', 'Much', 'blood', 'shed', 'body', 'count', 'Overall', 'what', 'cringe-worthy', 'satisfying.This', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'great', 'performaances', 'Gosling', 'Cranston', 'Perlman', 'Brooks', 'mentioned', 'shift', 'film', 'quiet', 'violent', 'happens', 'matter', 'seconds', 'Everything', 'Driver', 'protect', 'Irene', 'son', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'necessary', 'see', 'why', 'what', 'recommend', 'movie', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'pay', 'attention', 'first', 'half', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'quiet', 'subdued', 'theme', 'fool']",N/A

But I knew the people I was with only heard the word ""Drive"" and thought of action, heist, killing, etc. Normally I would enjoy films similar to this film that mixes drama and action in a sort of indie style or a style that most American audiences aren't used to. I watched the other film ""Bronson"" by this director after I watched ""Drive"". The director uses a lot of similar style and tricks, but that film was a character study and focused on their main character. ""Drive"" did not do the same. I will say that Drive is great to look at and and the sound was very good.So as we watched the film it started off well and from then it declines very slowly, and when I mean slowly this is a result of the two main actors Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan having a lot of interaction with each other and nearly no back and forth dialogue. This doesn't mean that nothing is said, Carey responds like a normal person most of the time and then Ryan's answer would be to just look at her, stare, and then smile.The only character I didn't like was Ryan Gosling's character because while the role may have required him to not speak as much, the movie shouldn't have tried to focus and draw out the relationship between two people that really don't communicate with each other. This is the biggest failure of the film is that when it is all said and done the film's focus is on the relationship between Ryan and Carey, with action becoming a part of the film at the end. The film at the one point changes tones so much that it leaves you confused.I will say to each their own when it comes to most things, this film was only rated a 2 star because the surrounding cast of characters did well. It looked very good and was filmed well, I did enjoy the sort of 80's synth soundtrack because it seemed to take me out of the dramatic points the film tried to focus on.I'll end with stating that if this movie had simply had some basic dialogue between the two main characters then it would've been passable and I would've actually been able to recommend it to people. But this is not the case, I am not the only person out there who felt that the lack of dialogue brings down the film.

A real love story here makes this movie a very good movie.  Affection between Ryan and boy really works.  Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan are great.  All actors are very good in this movie.  Took some time to get used to Albert Brooks as a gangster, but it worked for me by the third viewing.Some fun car chases.  Some fun cars.  Classy to choose a 1975 Malibu (modified with a great engine I'm sure) as Ryan's car.Are there any holes in this movie?  Sure.  And it has some rather violent, bloody moments.

1509878,A1FG91CM8221X1,B0064NTZJO,Miles D. Moore,"[10, 14]","Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Drive"" is the best thriller so far in a year that hasn't lacked for good thrillers. This stylish, breathlessly exciting film has the existential chic that George Clooney strove for in ""The American"" but didn't quite achieve.To describe the plot of ""Drive"" too closely would be a crime. Let's just say that the enigmatic, unnamed lead character (Ryan Gosling), movie stunt driver by day and getaway car driver-for-hire at night, gets into big trouble trying to help a young woman (Carey Mulligan) he's smitten with. The film slows down a bit toward the middle, but only to set up Refn's big wake-up surprise that keeps the film at fever pitch till the very end.Refn knows how to keep the audience's adrenaline pumping, and the photography and editing are state-of-the-art. Mulligan is quite touching as the woman the driver loves, and there are noteworthy supporting performances by Oscar Isaac as Mulligan's ex-con husband; Bryan Cranston as the driver's hard-luck best friend; and especially Albert Brooks in an astonishing, career-changing role as a movie producer-turned-mobster. But the ultimate impact of the film rests on Gosling's shoulders, and he is more than able to bear the weight. He keeps us guessing constantly about this character--his face often impassive but never blank--who is capable of both great tenderness and horrifying violence. Gosling has already been compared with Steve McQueen for this role, but he reminds me even more of Robert Mitchum. He looks nothing like Mitchum, of course, but he has that same sleepy-eyed intensity suggesting deep, almost unfathomable reserves of intelligence and emotion.At one point Brooks' character talks about the movies he produced.

1509882,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0064NTZJO,M. Oleson,"[14, 21]","I was expecting a good movie but nothing like this.  Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn delivers his first American film and boy does he deliver.  Ryan Gosling continues his launch to superstardom as a part time movie stunt driver which supplements his day job as a mechanic.  He also spends a few nights driving a getaway car for nefarious types.  Carey Mulligan plays his shy, but clearly interested neighbor, who lives with her young son.  Her husband, Standard is about to be released from prison.  But let me not get ahead of myself.  The story isn't that important.  We've seen it before and will certainly see it again.  What is important is the style and abdication of the traditional action thriller.The opening of the film has ""Driver"" (he has no other name) working with a couple burglars in the middle of the night.  When the cops are called, he monitors their communication on a police scanner.  This is where most movies activate the car chase sequence.  Refn does the scene in cat-and-mouse, hide-and-seek style.  It's brilliant as is the photography of a wet but brightly lit city.  Throughout the movie, Refn and his musical director layer a soundtrack reminiscent of Tangerine Dream or something from Giogio Moroder.  There is nothing familiar about the music.  I suspect it is Euro in its origins.  It is perfectly placed each time.Back to Irene and ""Driver"".  There is a scene when they first meet.  Both are very quiet as is the whole movie.  They don't talk much.  But when they look at each other, you can see the quiet begin to smolder.  It doesn't explode, but the attraction isn't hidden.  When Standard (never heard that name before) is released and comes home, again we expect a traditional confrontation between him and Driver.  Instead, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is very understanding.  He has debts, however and Driver offers to help him pull of a heist of a pawn shop.  It doesn't go well.  Let the violence begin.Like many brilliant movies (Taxi Driver, Godfather, Goodfellas), the violence becomes the antithesis of the quiet tone of the film.  It is quick but extremely graphic when it comes.  One of the great things about this movie is that it surprises at every turn.  The tension grabs you early and rarely releases.  It is not like a traditional thriller, where the action delivers the tension, then you rest when it's over.  This movie surprises, so you're never quite sure what will happen next.  At the same time Refn creates tenderness between the characters, especially between Driver and Irene, between Standard and Irene and between Driver and his mentor Shannon (Bryan Cranston).  Comparisons between Gosling's character and those created in the past by Clint Eastwood and Steve McQueen are valid.  I would also be remiss by pointing out the role of Bernie, the local mobster honcho played by Albert Brooks.  The comedian gives the film yet another pleasant surprise.  ""Driver"" succeeds on many levels.  It is an elegant, violent and cool art-house thriller.  And the best new movie I've seen this year.2-1-12 - Blu ray update:  This second helping on the just released Blu ray solidifies my original observations.  These subsequent viewings of great movies allow you to focus on things you might have missed the first time around...or just want to see it again.  Since I now know the plot (or at least think I do), can I find answers of confirm previous beliefs?  The story itself is as old as mythology.  Remember ""Camelot"" or at least the tale of King Arthur and his Queen Guinevere and the knight Lancelot?  The attraction between Guinevere and Lancelot is evident, but both want to remain loyal to their King who they love.Here we have Standard who is married to Irene.  By all accounts, although he made a mistake, he is otherwise a good guy.  The initial attraction between Irene and Driver smolders as they don't want to hurt Standard.  Their relationship is chaste but knowing he may be killed or at least leaving town, Driver acts on that attraction in the elevator.  In one of the best scenes in recent memory, he plants a long kiss on Irene.  Not one of those sloppy, all-over-your-face, tongue-in-mouth kisses but one of those real kisses like Cary Grant planted on Ingrid Bergman in ""Notorious."" This tender moment precludes a deadly confrontation with a hired killer in the same elevator.This movie is scant of dialog.  Instead the actors, especially Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan must perform with their eyes, their faces and their gestures.  The 3 ""car chase"" sequences are all different but they are expertly done and remain great moments in the film.  Albert Brooks should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Bernie Rose.  The soundtrack is perfectly layered.The Blu ray transfer is perfect.  Much of the film is at night, so the blacks must be black and the room should be dark.  The DTS-HD sound is magnificent and at its best during the car sequences.  The rumbling of the engines via the woofers and subs adds another type of musicality.  There are 4 supplemental featurettes with the producers, the director, the head stunt driver and all the primary actors except Ryan Gosling who is missing for some reason.",5,Blu ray Update for one of

There is really only one exciting, suspenseful car chase, and that opens the film.

1509889,A28J9NFHSF2ETC,B0064NTZJO,M. Wilson,"[7, 15]","I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it. With a title like ""Drive,"" it is easy to expect a film that is simply car chase after car chase, intermixed with gratuitous violence and a few sex scenes. I'm not going to act as if I don't watch those movies, too (because I do), and that is precisely why Drive was such an unexpected surprise.The film is subtle but powerful. In fact, the things that are left out of this film (long blocks of dialogue that hammer the viewer with what is happening in case they are too dumb to get it; sex scenes featuring body model stand-ins; a happy, predictable, neatly tied-up ending) is part of what makes it great. Just the gazes between Gosling and Mulligan say more than sappy scenes ever could. The cinematography is excellent. A darkness runs through the movie and appears in the images but also in the characters. The music intermixes really well--I even ended up buying the soundtrack to this movie, which I pretty much never do.I watched this film several times, and the more I thought about it (another great thing about this movie--it's one that can make you reflect), I started to consider the different meanings of the word ""Drive."" Yes, the protagonist is a driver. He drives. But perhaps the real meaning as it applies to the movie is, ""to send, expel, or otherwise move by force or compulsion."" So in this way, ""The Driver"" doesn't just drive the car, he forces the action, he is what makes what happens in the movie happen.This has become my favorite film and made me rethink the capabilities of Gosling as an actor.

Likewise, if you are in the mood for non-stop action and are hoping this movie will be likeCrankorFaster, you're going to be a bit disappointed. This is not a high-octane thriller. The movie actually moves very slowly. If anything, the movie reminds me a bit of the old Mel Gibson moviePAYBACK. Like that movie, you don't have a lot of action, special effects, famous actors and actresses, souped-up cars and gadgets, or fantastical and unrealistic heroes and villains. Everything in this movie is firmly set in reality. The main character is not a good guy, but he has a good heart, and at least has some moral code to drive him (no pun intended).Violent scenes come infrequently, but are very brutal when they make an appearance. There is one car cahase scene, but it is at the very beginning. The movie moves steadily towards a final showdown, which is a bit predictable, but you can't be sure of how it is all going to turn out, and that's a big plus, in my book.Overall, a pretty decent movie that I think most people will enjoy.

1509891,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0064NTZJO,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 10]","From director Nicolas Winding Refn (Valhalla Rising) comes Drive, a beautiful throwback to the car-fueled action dramas of the late 70s/early 80s.  Ryan Gosling stars as the otherwise unnamed Driver, a young man that works as a Hollywood stunt driver and mechanic during the day, and moonlights as a getaway driver by night.  It isn't long before his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) catches his attention, and he begins spending time with her and her young son while he and his handler Shannon (Bryan Cranston) appear to be setting themselves up for a lucrative business venture with a local crime boss (Albert Brooks), but when Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) returns from prison, it sets up a chain of events that send things spiraling out of control.  What makes Drive so spectacular is how Refn presents this tale: everything from the camerawork, to the editing, to the pulse-pounding synth-pop soundtrack, to the electrifying opening scene and unpredictable bursts of bloody violence all help make Drive a modern day classic.  It isn't a super flashy mellowdrama, and that's quite the good thing.  Gosling is solid, but it's Albert Brooks that leaves a lasting impression in what should have otherwise an Oscar-nominated role.  Mad Men's Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman are also on board, with the end result being a film that is something truly special indeed.

It's been a few months since I've seen it and honestly, I don't remember much of anything except the final shot. That's only because it was the most interesting part of the film for me. I'll lay out seven points in regards to my final thoughts:1) The action scenes are interesting, but not tense or particularly memorable. I remember the hammer scene only because it was featured prominently in the trailer.2) The style was definitely rockin', but the film seems more interested in creating a mood instead of interesting characters. Silence in regards to actors standing around doesn't build anything except, well, silence.3) The brief car chase in Drive was indeed pretty badass. Refn's technique is incredible in this sequence.4) The chemistry between Mulligan and Gosling felt forced. For man capable of great violence, his shift in tone is jarring and seems unwarranted. We're given reasons to care, but no implementation.5) Albert Brooks exhibits a profoundly radical shift in acting persona, and steals the show. Ron Perlman has a nice little nasty turn. Brian Cranston is nice as a ferret-like agent.6) All of the supporting characters are more interesting than the two leads.7) The climax is patently unsatisfying. I do not expect an epic showdown, but the methods used to showcase the fight were confusing and -- frankly -- uninteresting.

We are introduced to Gosling's character  - a mechanic who moonlights as a movie stunt driver and a robbery get-away-driver for hire -  as a nice guy with an even temper who seems content to allow other people to take advantage of him.  When he's on a driving job he is focused,  calm and his heart rate never seems to rise  even in the most dangerous of situations.  Half way through the movie events transpire - resulting from a superficial acquaintance  with a young woman and her child - which made me reevaluate the first impression I had of this character. I enjoyed this movie because it surprised me by taking off in directions I didn't expect.  Just when I thought I had figured out what was going to happen next something else happened that I didn't anticipate.  The  decision to go against type-casting and have Albert Brooks play the crime boss was brilliant.  You will see Albert Brooks as you have never seen him before.  I didn't give it five stars because I thought there were holes in the plot that needed further explanation.  The writers don't even attempt to provide any sort of back story for Gosling's character that would explain his actions and the choices he makes.  We are only told that he showed up at the garage where he works six years ago willing to work for less money than he should have been paid.

There were too many scenes with hardly any dialogue and just long stare segments, it felt overdone.  The nudity during a crucial scene.

1509906,A11TUHEHHENLBC,B0064NTZJO,"Patrick L. Boyle ""Mr. Wonderful""","[6, 11]","I remember a movie review about Bruce Dern from years ago. ""Yes he can act, but can he play a human being?""In the case of Ryan Gosling I'm still not sure he can act and there are no recognizable humans in the screenplay. I had heard that this was Gosling's year. He is simultaneously in two big popular movies. I chose this one because it is the one that doesn't also star George Clooney. After watching Gosling in this film - I'm still not sure, can he act? The character he plays is so odd as to be unrecognizable as a person.After about ten minutes into the movie Gosling still hadn't said a word on camera. I thought to myself, maybe now that he's this hot new movie star he will soon move up to speaking parts. Yes I know he's trying to be cool, but he's so emotionally unavailable it just comes off as robotic. I've been alive a long time and I've met a lot of people, the only people I have ever met who were this odd were those guys I met that summer when I worked in a mental institution. I have read about weird loners like this in some true crime accounts of serial killers. Gosling plays the driver as a very strange dude indeed.This movie makes you think, or rather this movie gives you a lot of time to think because of all the extremely slow scenes in which nothing happens. You start to think about other getaway driver movies. This film is very similar in many ways to the Ryan O'Neal film ""The Driver"". The protagonist in that film also didn't say much. In contrast Jason Statham in the ""The Transporter"" was rather chatty. In each of these movies the dramatic arc is that getaway driver is set up as a quiet rather precise sort of fellow who suddenly reveals himself to be a killing machine. Statham - who was an Olympic athlete - takes off his shirt and beats the snot out of a dozen guys at once. It's all very amusing if not very plausible. Ryan O'Neal - who was a former professional boxer - is more credible as a guy who explodes into violence. Another similar film was James Caan in ""Thief"" where he plays another one of these cool self controlled professional criminals who in the final reels reveals a hitherto unsuspected capacity for violence.So this movie is a genre movie and Gosling's driver is someone we have seen before. But each movie must top the previous movie (some Hollywood law) and so Gosling when he is cool in the early scenes is beyond normal cool - he's catatonic. And when in the later scenes when he violent he's psychotic. In the character's defense I must reveal that everyone else in this movie is also psychotic. He fits right in.What's so odd about the character? First of all he cares nothing for money. In the previous three films I cited the drivers were always very careful about money. This seems reasonable. They are all criminals aiding robbers. People rob for money. But Gosling's character is indifferent to money. There are at least three scenes in which he establishes that he is not interested in money. What then does he care about? Not people. He's very much a loner with no friends. Of course it's hard to make friends if you never speak. He's also not interested in women at least in any kind of sexual way. He has a platonic relationship with his next door neighbor but he's not a lover - more like an old friend of the family. The romance in this film rings very false.What does he care about? Well, he seems to like to kill people in grotesque ways.Steve McQueen often played cool quiet characters. Indeed he was the first choice for O'Neal's part in ""The Driver"", but McQueen was still emotionally available. He communicated to the audience that he felt things and cared about things even when he didn't show much. Of course he never was saddled with a character as bizarre as that of Gosling's driver. So maybe it isn't Gosling at all. Maybe it's just the screenplay that's so peculiar. Maybe Gosling played it exactly right. In that case I take back every criticism of Gosling himself and transfer it all to the screenwriter. In any case this film stinks.",3,No Human Beings,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,4030,"['remember', 'movie', 'review', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'act', 'can', 'play', 'human', 'being', 'case', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'act', 'are', 'recognizable', 'humans', 'screenplay', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'Gosling', 'year', 'simultaneously', 'two', 'big', 'popular', 'movies', 'chose', 'one', 'one', ""n't"", 'also', 'star', 'George', 'Clooney', 'watching', 'Gosling', 'film', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'act', 'character', 'so', 'odd', 'be', 'unrecognizable', 'person.After', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Gosling', 'still', 'had', ""n't"", 'said', 'word', 'camera', 'thought', 'myself', 'maybe', 'now', 'hot', 'new', 'movie', 'star', 'will', 'soon', 'move', 'up', 'speaking', 'parts', 'Yes', 'know', 'trying', 'be', 'cool', 'so', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'just', 'off', 'robotic', ""'ve"", 'been', 'alive', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'met', 'lot', 'people', 'only', 'people', 'have', 'ever', 'met', 'who', 'were', 'odd', 'were', 'guys', 'met', 'summer', 'when', 'worked', 'mental', 'institution', 'have', 'read', 'weird', 'loners', 'true', 'crime', 'accounts', 'serial', 'killers', 'Gosling', 'driver', 'very', 'strange', 'dude', 'indeed.This', 'movie', 'think', 'rather', 'movie', 'lot', 'time', 'think', 'extremely', 'slow', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'start', 'think', 'other', 'getaway', 'driver', 'movies', 'film', 'very', 'similar', 'many', 'ways', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'film', 'Driver', 'protagonist', 'film', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'contrast', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Transporter', 'was', 'rather', 'chatty', 'movies', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'getaway', 'driver', 'set', 'up', 'quiet', 'rather', 'precise', 'sort', 'fellow', 'who', 'suddenly', 'be', 'killing', 'machine', 'Statham', 'who', 'was', 'Olympic', 'athlete', 'shirt', 'snot', 'dozen', 'guys', 'once', 'very', 'amusing', 'not', 'very', 'plausible', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'who', 'was', 'former', 'professional', 'boxer', 'more', 'credible', 'guy', 'who', 'violence', 'similar', 'film', 'was', 'James', 'Caan', 'Thief', 'where', 'one', 'cool', 'self', 'controlled', 'professional', 'criminals', 'who', 'final', 'reels', 'hitherto', 'unsuspected', 'capacity', 'violence.So', 'movie', 'genre', 'movie', 'Gosling', 'driver', 'someone', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'must', 'top', 'previous', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'law', 'so', 'Gosling', 'when', 'cool', 'early', 'scenes', 'normal', 'cool', 'catatonic', 'when', 'later', 'scenes', 'when', 'violent', 'psychotic', 'character', 'defense', 'must', 'reveal', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'also', 'psychotic', 'right', 'in.What', 'so', 'odd', 'character', 'First', 'all', 'nothing', 'money', 'previous', 'three', 'films', 'cited', 'drivers', 'were', 'always', 'very', 'careful', 'money', 'reasonable', 'are', 'criminals', 'aiding', 'robbers', 'People', 'rob', 'money', 'Gosling', 'character', 'indifferent', 'money', 'are', 'least', 'three', 'scenes', 'not', 'interested', 'money', 'What', 'then', 'care', 'Not', 'people', 'very', 'much', 'loner', 'friends', 'course', 'hard', 'make', 'friends', 'never', 'speak', 'also', 'not', 'interested', 'women', 'least', 'kind', 'sexual', 'way', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'not', 'lover', 'more', 'old', 'friend', 'family', 'romance', 'film', 'very', 'false.What', 'care', 'Well', 'like', 'kill', 'people', 'grotesque', 'ways.Steve', 'McQueen', 'often', 'played', 'cool', 'quiet', 'characters', 'Indeed', 'was', 'first', 'choice', ""O'Neal"", 'part', 'Driver', 'McQueen', 'was', 'still', 'emotionally', 'available', 'communicated', 'audience', 'felt', 'things', 'cared', 'things', 'even', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'much', 'course', 'never', 'was', 'saddled', 'character', 'as', 'bizarre', 'Gosling', 'driver', 'So', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'Gosling', 'Maybe', 'just', 'screenplay', 'so', 'peculiar', 'Maybe', 'Gosling', 'played', 'exactly', 'right', 'case', 'take', 'back', 'criticism', 'Gosling', 'transfer', 'screenwriter', 'case', 'film', 'stinks']",N/A
1509907,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0064NTZJO,Paul Allaer,"[0, 1]","I saw &#34;Drive&#34; when it came out in the theaters in 2011, loved it, and now we are already in 2014. I watch a lot of films, but rarely watch them more than once. But I had to make an exception for this one (more on that later).&#34;Drive&#34; (2011 release; 100 min.) brings the story of a driver, whose real name we never learn (played by Ryan Gosling). Our man is a stunt driver for Hollywood movies. On the side, he also offers his services as a drive-away man for hold-ups and other crimes. The movie opens with a thrilling 10 min. pre-opening credits getaway and car chase scene that will have your heart pumping. Later on, our man gets to know his neighbor Irene, a lovely single mom (played by Carey Mulligan) and her young boy. Her husband is serving time in jail, but will be released soon. Our man and Irene hit it off beautifully. Then, when her husband is released, the troubles start. To tell you more will spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is one of those rare films where everything just clicks: the characters, the action, the atmosphere, the photography, the overall &#34;feel&#34; of the movie. Speaking of the latter, the overall &#34;feel&#34; reminds me vaguely of that film &#34;Thief&#34; by Michael Mann from the early 80s. Second, the performances of Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan are top-notch, without a doubt, but there are several other smaller choice roles that round out the movie so nicely, including Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman and check out also Oscar Isaac, who plays a small role (about 15 min. of screen time) as Irene's husband, yes he of the lead role in &#34;Inside Llewyn Davis&#34;! Last but not least, one of the other reasons that lead me to re-see &#34;Drive&#34; is that I am going through a Cliff Martinez phase right now. Martinez scored the soundtrack, a beautiful, dark, moody electronic score that matches the film's overall's feel perfectly. Just fantastic.&#34;Drive&#34; was directed by Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, and with the artistic and commercial credit he gained for &#34;Drive&#34;, his next Hollywood project, where he reteamed with Ryan Gosling and Cliff Martinez, was last year's &#34;Only God Forgives&#34;, a critical and commercial flop. I have seen it, and even though it is similarly dark as &#34;Drive&#34;, it badly misfires indeed. It's a thin line between love and hate in Hollywood, but so it goes. On the contrary, &#34;Drive&#34; stands the test and holds up after repeated viewing.

However I believe the largest contribution to this film does belong to Refn, and is the authentic product of Scandinavian cinema and television.This element is: 'slow-moving character study of brooding protagonists harboring an inner dark side'. The dialogue here is the opposite of Seinfeld: few things are articulated, voice tone and facial expression are of great importance to understanding the character's nuances of emotion. In some ways this taciturn method of delivery mimics how people express themselves in Scandinavian societies. The fascination with brooding, taciturn characters and the portrayal of bleakness and foreboding - the 'inner darkness' - means that these films would be most appealing to those who relate psychologically to these characters.This is the reason for the film's 'slowness', and if the viewer cannot hook into the meaning of this slow-pacedness, they may assume that nothing is happening.

Watching the trailer left me thinking Drive was a story about a race car driver who works on the side driving getaway cars for thieves and other criminals. Some aspects made it look like an action roadster movie with tons of chase scenes and big `escape the police' action sequences.There's a little bit of that, but a whole lot more under the hood. The director, Nicolas Winding Refn, has recreated a 1970s styled....Burt Reynolds flick mixed with a little James Dean cool. Ryan Gosling (also in The Notebook and The Ides of March, opposite George Clooney) is cast as `the kid', an unnamed mechanic with a sordid past and dangerous alter-ego hiding behind his outer shell of innocence. It's a great casting that at first makes you wonder how `the kid' can change the world around him with his quiet and soft demeanor.The plot is pretty simple and straightforward. The kid befriends a lone mother and child and their growing relationship is complicated by the release of the boy's father, a Standard Gabriel (played by Oscar Isaac from Sucker Punch). His troubles follow him out of the box as he finds himself still boxed in and needs to pull off one last job. It's an odd proposition for our driver. He has the unique skill-set to help, but why is he risking his life, only to help the woman he wants- move on without him? If everything goes well...c'mon you know the rest. That last job never turns out as planned.A woman who left the theater ahead of me said she felt like her stomach tightened up and only relaxed as the credits rolled. I agree. This is a suspenseful movie that revels in its atmosphere. It feels dark and ominous. The cinematography and location(s) help sink us into bleakness as L.A. is rendered as a far away glittery and dreamy backdrop to the darkest of places, characters and deeds.Bernie Rose, played by Albert Brooks, is the perfect combination of mobster, thug and 1940s gangster. When meeting the kid, there is a tense moment when a handshake is expected. The Driver pauses and you wonder if their relationship is going to start off with an insult. The kid says his hands are dirty and so that's why he's not shaking hands. Bernie Rose replies `so are mine'. The double meaning of `dirty hands' and the interplay between characters throughout is well scripted and executed.At some point I would like to revisit this movie and discuss it again after it's been around a while so we can include spoilers and twists.In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movies. I felt like I had seen a throwback to a grittier era. The on-screen violence is filmed in a very realistic way. It's shocking without being done for shock value. It also explains why your stomach was so knotted. You knew it was coming.This is one of those movies that gets better the more you think about it. As you remember how cool this scene and that scene was and how some of the simplest of actions are given so much weight and meaning, you'll realize you've seen a really good movie. There's lots of symbolism and repeated motifs to pick up so it also stands up well in repeat viewings. I recommend this movie to all my friends.

I can appreciate many things about ""Drive"", but, when it was over I sort of wondered if I really cared.I think Ryan Gosling is one of our finest young actors, and he seemed to be channeling his inner suffering (or ambivalence) to copy his performance in ""Half-Nelson"", which was actually more nuanced and centered. I'm sorry I wasn't more involved. Carey Mulligan brooded a lot, and the only breath of life I noticed was by the guy who played her husband. Albert Brooks had won a lot of awards for his heartless, nasty mob boss (I'd admired him for many years and was glad to hear he was back on the screen). Well, nothing against Brooks, but his character was written to be one-dimensional and there wasn't really any semblance of who he was, where he came from or where he intended to go. Ron Perlman was effective in his small role.I tried to put together what Refn was trying to do. I didn't think the story was fresh at all, reminiscent of ""Collateral"" and the noirish feel of ""L A Confidential"", a superb film, seemed to be present.

One was &lt;em>Absentia&lt;/em>, which has since come to top my own Best-of-2011 list. The other was &lt;em>Drive&lt;/em>, Nicolas Winding Refn's neo-&lt;em>noir&lt;/em> starring Ryan Gosling, which is finally got round to seeing last night. It's not the best film of 2011 (there is little wrong with it, but when it goes wrong, it goes &lt;em>way&lt;/em> wrong; more on that later), but it's pretty fantastic.I should note for the record that I've been a Ryan Gosling fan since &lt;em>Breaker High&lt;/em>. Yes, I admit it. (And if you've never checked &lt;em>Breaker High&lt;/em> out, the actor playing Gosling's buddy is Tyler Labine. That show packed some serious young talent.) He's always been a good actor for edgy, unlikable characters; check &lt;em>The Believer&lt;/em> or &lt;em>The United States of Leland&lt;/em>. Gosling has been treading the same basic ground as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and doing it just as well, for the same time period, but we look at him and think ""hey, it's that nice, clean-cut kid from &lt;em>The Notebook&lt;/em>!"". And then he pops up in &lt;em>Drive&lt;/em> and people still manage to be shocked. (Go back and re-watch &lt;em>The Believer&lt;/em>, which is just as good as &lt;em>Drive&lt;/em>, for a little perspective.)Gosling plays Driver, a mechanic/stunt driver who moonlights as a freelance getaway guy for small-time crooks pulling heists. (The opening sequence of the film is a great account of this side job.) All is going well in Driver's life until Irene (&lt;em>An Education&lt;/em>'s Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos in his screen debut), his neighbors from down the hall, enter his life. Driver starts to see what a life he has never allowed himself--a stable home, a family--looks like, and it's a powerful attraction. Problem is, Irene's husband Standard (&lt;em>Sucker Punch&lt;/em>'s Oscar Isaac) is getting out of prison. And he's in debt to some guys. And maybe needs a getaway driver...The plot, from a Hossein Amini script adapted from a James Sallis novel, is pretty standard stuff for &lt;em>noir&lt;/em>, where everyone's a criminal and life is incapable of ending well for anyone involved. The best parts of this film are in the way Amini writes the characters, especially the minor characters, and how Refn brings those characters to life. (It helps that most of those minor characters are played by very big names, including Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Christina Hendricks, and Russ Tamblyn, among others.) Our ability to empathize with Driver, a character written to have the best poker face in the movies, is pretty impressive, and that's down to the combination of Amini's writing, Refn's directing, and Gosling's acting, all of which are impeccable here.The movie only really goes wrong in its incidentals. The soundtrack is &lt;em>awful&lt;/em>, saccharine and overbearing and as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. In other words, it is everything the script is not, and it detracts from the movie in a fundamental way by being so painfully obvious. There's also a sense that, towards the end, some stuff is missing, though that sense is minor enough that I could have been reading more into it than there actually was (specifically, I got the feeling there was history between Rose and Driver/Shannon that went way beyond what we saw, but there's zero actual evidence of this save some of the things Rose says to each of them towards the end of the movie). If I'm right, well, I'd have gladly spent another half an hour in the company of these characters and the dark clouds that hang over them in order to explore that further.And while I've been hammering on the acting job Gosling did in this flick, I don't want to take away from Carey Mulligan's job here, which is heartbreaking. There's a great, great shot in this flick as we're looking at her through a stationary camera placed in an elevator as the door's getting ready to close. She stands stock-still and everything we need to know about not only her character, but the entire rest of the movie, is contained in the expression on her face. As much as this word is overused in American dialogue, I think it's warranted here--that shot is awesome, in the classic sense of the word. It inspires awe. I'd stick it in the modern film canon right there with the abduction scene in &lt;em>Rabbit-Proof Fence&lt;/em> or the ten-minute shot at the center of Haneke's &lt;em>Funny Games&lt;/em> or the dance at the beginning of &lt;em>Werckmeister Harmonies&lt;/em>. It's that good.Do I need to tell you I'm recommending this movie?

1509928,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B0064NTZJO,Robin Friedman,"[3, 5]","Based on a novel by James Sallis and set in contemporary Los Angeles, ""Drive"" (2011) is a film of violence, repressed passion, rawness, cars, and beauty. Directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, the movie stars Ryan Gosling playing an unnamed driver with extraordinary skills and control behind the wheel. The driver is taciturn, handsome and a loner.  Playing the part, Gosling's eyes smolder with repressed rage. The driver has lived in Los Angeles for 5-6 years when the story takes place, but otherwise little is told about his past or background. The viewer can only guess at how the driver became the man he is. During the day, driver makes his living working in an auto repair shop and doing stunt driving for the movies.  At night, he is a getaway man for robbers.Driver lives in a shabby Los Angeles apartment (I was reminded of Charles Bukowski's early haunts) and meets a new neighbor, a lovely young woman named Irene played by Carey Mulligan who has a small son. Opinions differ about Mulligan's suitability for this role, but I found her convincing. Irene has a husbsnd about to be released from prison. In a relationship described more by innuendo and looks, the driver and Irene are becoming close. When Irene's husband comes home, the mob threatens him and his family unless he pulls a robbery of a pawnshop. Out of feelings for Irene, driver agrees to be the driver for the heist. The robbery goes awry and sets the stage for the long, bloody, violent, and varied denoument of the movie.The movie is filled with character parts, including driver and several mob figures at different levels of organized crime. The acting is strong throughout with Gosling's portrayal of driver and Albert  Brooks playing a Jewish ganster named Bernie Rose particularly impressive.  The movie captures low-life Los Angeles in its scenes of cheap apartments, ragged streets, strip clubs, carry-outs with mobster connections, pawn shops, auto repair shops, and more. There are extensive scenes of the skyline, of deserted beaches and of open road. Much is made of driver's skill and fortitude as he makes dazzling turns, evades pursing wehicles, endures collisions and road wars, and keeps a cool head. The film features several rock songs which enhance the action together with arhythmic pounding score which I found enhanced the story.  The cascade of violence in the second half of the movie, showing novel and brutal forms of killing, builds in intensity towards the close. The effects of this movie, including the long silences, double takes and stares, music, lighting, settings and shifts of scene add a great deal of thought and beauty to what otherwise might simply be a movie of violence and fast cars.The unnaamed mysterious loner, skilled at what he does but otherwise a cipher is at the heart of this movie. He is shown in an unfolding rage with a highly vulnerable side.  The mystery of the character adds much to the movie. The portrayal of the seamy violence of a city's underbelly, the essential element of noir, is intensified through the artistry of the presentation. This movie could be seen as concentrating on the driver's singlemindedness and ability to take his one skill to the level of an art. But the movie seems to me to speak at least as much of the nature of being a solitary, lost, rootless, and alone. Although there are many parallels that might be drawn to this movie, I was reminded of Robert De Niro's portrayal of the loner and violent Travis Bickel in Martin Scorces's film ""Taxi Driver"" of many years ago.  ""Drive"" is a rare work in its appeal to lovers of noir and to lovers of art film.Time: 100 minutesRobin Friedman",5,Noir and Art,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,3650,"['Based', 'novel', 'James', 'Sallis', 'set', 'contemporary', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Drive', '2011', 'film', 'violence', 'repressed', 'passion', 'rawness', 'cars', 'beauty', 'Directed', 'Nicholas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'movie', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'playing', 'unnamed', 'driver', 'extraordinary', 'skills', 'control', 'wheel', 'driver', 'taciturn', 'handsome', 'loner', 'Playing', 'part', 'Gosling', 'eyes', 'smolder', 'repressed', 'rage', 'driver', 'lived', 'Los', 'Angeles', '5-6', 'years', 'when', 'story', 'place', 'otherwise', 'little', 'told', 'past', 'background', 'viewer', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'how', 'driver', 'became', 'man', 'day', 'driver', 'living', 'working', 'auto', 'repair', 'shop', 'doing', 'stunt', 'driving', 'movies', 'night', 'getaway', 'man', 'robbers.Driver', 'lives', 'shabby', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'apartment', 'was', 'reminded', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', 'early', 'haunts', 'new', 'neighbor', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Irene', 'played', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'small', 'son', 'Opinions', 'differ', 'Mulligan', 'suitability', 'role', 'found', 'convincing', 'Irene', 'husbsnd', 'be', 'released', 'prison', 'relationship', 'described', 'more', 'innuendo', 'driver', 'Irene', 'are', 'becoming', 'close', 'When', 'Irene', 'husband', 'home', 'mob', 'family', 'robbery', 'pawnshop', 'feelings', 'Irene', 'driver', 'be', 'driver', 'heist', 'robbery', 'awry', 'stage', 'long', 'bloody', 'violent', 'varied', 'denoument', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'character', 'parts', 'including', 'driver', 'several', 'mob', 'figures', 'different', 'levels', 'organized', 'crime', 'acting', 'strong', 'Gosling', 'portrayal', 'driver', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'playing', 'Jewish', 'ganster', 'named', 'Bernie', 'Rose', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'movie', 'low-life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'scenes', 'cheap', 'apartments', 'ragged', 'streets', 'strip', 'clubs', 'carry-outs', 'mobster', 'connections', 'pawn', 'shops', 'auto', 'repair', 'shops', 'more', 'are', 'extensive', 'scenes', 'skyline', 'deserted', 'beaches', 'open', 'road', 'Much', 'made', 'driver', 'skill', 'fortitude', 'dazzling', 'turns', 'evades', 'pursing', 'wehicles', 'endures', 'collisions', 'road', 'wars', 'cool', 'head', 'film', 'several', 'rock', 'songs', 'enhance', 'action', 'together', 'arhythmic', 'pounding', 'score', 'found', 'enhanced', 'story', 'cascade', 'violence', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'showing', 'novel', 'brutal', 'forms', 'killing', 'builds', 'intensity', 'close', 'effects', 'movie', 'including', 'long', 'silences', 'double', 'stares', 'music', 'lighting', 'settings', 'shifts', 'scene', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'thought', 'beauty', 'what', 'otherwise', 'might', 'simply', 'be', 'movie', 'violence', 'fast', 'cars.The', 'unnaamed', 'mysterious', 'loner', 'skilled', 'what', 'otherwise', 'cipher', 'heart', 'movie', 'shown', 'unfolding', 'rage', 'highly', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'mystery', 'character', 'much', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'seamy', 'violence', 'city', 'underbelly', 'essential', 'element', 'noir', 'intensified', 'artistry', 'presentation', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'concentrating', 'driver', 'singlemindedness', 'ability', 'take', 'one', 'skill', 'level', 'art', 'movie', 'speak', 'least', 'much', 'nature', 'being', 'solitary', 'lost', 'rootless', 'alone', 'are', 'many', 'parallels', 'might', 'be', 'drawn', 'movie', 'was', 'reminded', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'portrayal', 'loner', 'violent', 'Travis', 'Bickel', 'Martin', 'Scorces', 'film', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Drive', 'rare', 'work', 'appeal', 'lovers', 'noir', 'lovers', 'art', 'film.Time', '100', 'minutesRobin', 'Friedman']",N/A
1509929,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0064NTZJO,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 5]","Not since ""Taxi Driver"" has there been so glorious a paean to the poetry of driving as the appropriately titled ""Drive,"" a film that received a standing ovation when it was unspooled at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011.  Indeed, the film is an homage of sorts to Scorsese's 1976 classic as well as to its iconic lead character, Travis Bickle.As Ryan Gosling's unnamed character cruises hypnotically along the streets of downtown L.A., he seems all of a piece with his vehicle - almost as if it were an extension of him or he of it. For Gosling, driving is clearly both an obsession and an art form and he brings to it all the finely-tuned grace and immersive concentration of a symphony conductor or a prima ballerina. Taciturn almost to the point of inarticulateness, Gosling's character only comes fully alive when he's behind the wheel of a car. Indeed, almost a full quarter-of-an-hour of running time elapses before he speaks a word, and even then - and indeed throughout the course of the film - it's only to utter some banal commonplace or half-articulated thought. Language cannot convey his feelings, the sense of who he is; only driving can. Speech serves a strictly utilitarian function for Gosling, but driving speaks to his soul. And, appropriately, both his jobs - that of an assistant mechanic at a local repair place and a daredevil stuntman for the movies - involve working with cars to one extent or another. And, oh yes, he also sells his services as getaway driver for an assortment of sleazy armed robbers willing to pay his price and play by his rules.This last fact is what winds up causing problems for the character, when he falls in love with an attractive neighbor (Carey Mulligan) whose husband gets paroled from prison early on in the movie. But the direction the story takes with this plot turn is not what you might expect, thanks to an intelligent screenplay by Hossein Amini based on James Sallis` novel of the same name.Gosling's character fits comfortably in the mold of Travis Bickle - a morally ambiguous yet righteously angry antihero who defends innocent women and children against the evils of the world while freely crossing over that line himself. And at times he seems almost as mentally unhinged and psychotic as Bickle himself does. Yet, Gosling also runs the risk of inadvertently endangering both himself and those he cares about with his actions.  The dual nature of the character is evident throughout the picture in the radically different ways in which he treats the various people in his life.  Indeed, it is only with Irene and her young son, Benicio, that Gosling can be unconditionally and stoically tender - in stark contrast to the methodical brutality with which he dispatches the numerous enemies who are out to get him (be forewarned: the violence in the film can be unnervingly graphic at times).Perpetually clad in a silver racing jacket - its collar turned up and a giant scorpion printed on the back - Gosling delivers his most indelible screen performance to date. Largely denied the tool of dialogue to define the character, Gosling is forced to rely almost exclusively on facial expressions and body language to convey the man's thoughts and feelings at any given moment. And he does an award-worthy job, for he commands our attention every split second of the time he is on the screen - which is virtually always.  He's like a muted vortex drawing us into the heart of the character.The superb cast is rounded out by a hirsute Bryan Cranston (""Breaking Bad"") as the owner of the shop where Gosling works; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman (""Sons of Anarchy"") as mob bosses looking to hire Gosling to be the driver for a stock car they're planning on purchasing; and a barely recognizable Christina Hendricks (from ""Mad Men"") as a moll who gets in over her head on one of Gosling's ""jobs.""  Heck, even Russ Tamblyn, of ""West Side Story"" fame, makes a cameo appearance!Those who criticize the film for being too arty and Gosling's character for being too taciturn seem, to me, to be missing the point entirely. First, he is inarticulate precisely because he has found a means of expressing himself (i.e. driving) that doesn`t require conventional language. (In fact, wouldn't that criticism eliminate all silent movies automatically?) And, second, like a fine wine, the movie can be savored strictly on the basis of its aesthetic qualities (""The New World"" is a similar film that comes to mind). We are transported to a different world through the sheer beauty of the imagery and pacing, the mesmerizing performances, the hypnotic and smoothly flowing tracking shots (kudos to cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel), the haunting score (more kudos to Cliff Martinez) and canny soundtrack choices.As a director, Danish-born Nicolas Winding Refn is clearly a filmmaker to the manner born, demonstrating a command and mastery of the medium that leaves one breathless with admiration and awe. For ""Drive"" is a movie that revels in its own being.  And that makes it a special treat for anyone sophisticated and savvy enough to appreciate its cinematic richness.",5,Mesmerizing piece of pure cinema,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,5116,"['Not',

Refn is always aware of the genre his film may be compared to and deliberately severs the connection between the two in his most poignant  scenes. Where one style would speed things up and force edit cuts on you every few seconds, Refn slows things down and lets you feel the pulse of each character, he lets you study them before the inevitable brutality commences. For example...*Possible Spoilers Below...you'll notice the film features the bloodiest and most brutal scenes at the beginning and towards the middle, and then consciously removes the gore in favor of allowing the audience to soak in the character during the event, rather than the shock value of the event itself; this style emerges slowly and then reaches its peak in the finale. I believe this was deliberate and I feel it was very effective in giving this film its own tone, its own formula.Don't expect what you've been programmed to expect; this is not a remake, sequel, rehash of old formulas, this is something new so study and try to enjoy it for what it is. I do not feel this film is made for everyone, but I do feel that a lot of viewers aren't judging it for what it is, merely how different it may be from what they were expecting. I try to enter a film with a blank slate as much as I can, don't listen to promotions, don't watch too many trailers, just go and experience the film for what it is; Drive is definitely one of those times where you will benefit from pushing PLAY, open your eyes and ears and experience what the director intended...then discuss.",5,Don't blame the Director for Marketing's Folly,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,2161,"['spectacular', 'film', 'acting', 'extremely', 'subtle', 'emotionally', 'driven', 'music', 'spot', 'perfect', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'soundtrack', 'right', 'afterward', 'did', 'mood', 'so', 'super-cool', ""'ll"", 'want', 'live', 'remarkable', 'moments', 'beat', 'beat', 'film.First', 'concede', 'marketing', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'attempted', 'sell', 'movie', 'something', 'different', 'what', 'hardly', 'Nicholas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'Director', 'fault', 'fore', 'mentioned', 'fact', 'should', 'not', 'cause', 'fail', 'enjoy', 'what', 'can', 'most', 'closely', 'be', 'described', 'art-house', 'actioner', 'brilliant', 'auteur', 'Refn', 'always', 'aware', 'genre', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'compared', 'deliberately', 'connection', 'two', 'most', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'Where', 'one', 'style', 'would', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'force', 'edit', 'cuts', 'few', 'seconds', 'Refn', 'things', 'down', 'feel', 'pulse', 'character', 'study', 'inevitable', 'brutality', 'commences', 'example', '*Possible', 'Spoilers', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'film', 'bloodiest', 'most', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'towards', 'middle', 'then', 'consciously', 'gore', 'favor', 'allowing', 'audience', 'soak', 'character', 'event', 'rather', 'shock', 'value', 'event', 'style', 'slowly', 'then', 'peak', 'finale', 'believe', 'was', 'deliberate', 'feel', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'giving', 'film', 'own', 'tone', 'own', 'formula.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'programmed', 'expect', 'not', 'remake', 'sequel', 'rehash', 'old', 'formulas', 'something', 'new', 'so', 'study', 'try', 'enjoy', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'film', 'made', 'everyone', 'do', 'feel', 'lot', 'viewers', 'are', ""n't"", 'judging', 'what', 'merely', 'how', 'different', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'try', 'enter', 'film', 'blank', 'slate', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'promotions', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'too', 'many', 'trailers', 'just', 'go', 'experience', 'film', 'what', 'Drive', 'definitely', 'one', 'times', 'where', 'will', 'benefit', 'pushing', 'PLAY', 'open', 'eyes', 'ears', 'experience', 'what', 'director', 'intended', 'then', 'discuss']",N/A

At first it seems a bit awkward that Ryan Gosling's character doesn't say much, but I learned to really appreciate the silence in the movie. It gave the movie a definite ""cool"" factor.

I found myself hanging on every word and body movement, which was really refreshing and it kept me on the edge of my seat. In a world of movies and TV shows with non-stop mindless chatter and jabbering, DRIVE was a breath of fresh air.Without giving too much away, this movie is a cross between the action scenes of ""Transporter"", the mob/gangster storyline of ""Departed"", and the darkness of Donnie Darko (because the lead character was a bit strange in that movie, too). The music sounds a bit ""80's-esque"" as well, which was when the setting of Donnie Darko took place.But with those slight comparisons aside, it's a unique movie with incredible style.

The Blu quality is amazing, and depending on the scene it will be testing your blacks and dark motion sensitivity to the extreme. There are two LA skyline night shots that are worthy of pausing and looking for detail clarity. Several other shots with different cameras are almost Michael Mann-ish in their grain and coloring, but so is a lot of this film. The sound is a mixed bag - beautiful yet possibly dangerous depending how high you might be cranking it up to hear the center channel subtleties laced for 15 minutes - followed unexpectedly with a flood of high pitches/decibel increase (follow the hints with the music - when it starts to fade or the lights are coming back to brightness after fading - quick turn it back down before your center gets blown). The DTS is great in the two main chase sequences and the motors were overamped just right.The special features are definitely a mixed bag:* Cut to the Chase, 4:35 minutes. Listed it first because this was the one I had the most interest in...specifically how they pulled off that reverse 270 with the actress in the shot. Unfortunately this was way too short and only glossed over what should have been a 30 minute piece on the stunts...worthy enough though to discover that sequence was not CGI.* Driver & Irene, 6:14 minutes. This and the next two are so clip-heavy they provide so little substance - all forgettable. This one follows the love story angle with talking heads and clips.* Under the Hood, 11:50 minutes. Not what I had hoped as I was looking for car and motor info. Instead it is an extremely clip-heavy talking head piece about the actors and their takes on characters.* I Drive, 5:26 minutes. A confused quip that looks like it was cut from the the prior segment about actors working with the director.* Drive without the Driver, 25:41 minutes. Wow, I cannot think of a more boring way to get all of the information that leads up to the film being made, how it was cast, and so forth. The director (who I respect from his prior work - he assuredly has an eye for filming) sits on a hood of a car and rambles for 25 minutes about the process, essentially a commentary - but as an interview. If you are fans of commentaries (which I am) then you will dig this segment - otherwise a skipper.Overall a fascinating look at a performance film preserved on a solid Blu that has a great picture quality and test-worthy sound, the supplements ding this from being a five but there are no half-stars here...4 for the film and BD specs, .5 star for the supplements.",5,"Solid indie film, competent Blu",1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,3031,"['ton', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'went', 'undeterred', 'see', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'could', 'finally', 'be', 'worthy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'discovered', 'found', 'way', 'great', 'product', 'preservation', 'here.The', 'story', 'driver', 'code', 'formula', 'who', 'love', 'lady', 'things', 'mess', 'code', 'actually', 'summary', 'virtually', 'taken', 'producers', 'film', 'admitting', 'was', 'nothing', 'different', 'film', 'how', 'was', 'filmed', 'Blu', 'quality', 'amazing', 'depending', 'scene', 'will', 'be', 'testing', 'blacks', 'dark', 'motion', 'sensitivity', 'extreme', 'are', 'two', 'LA', 'skyline', 'night', 'shots', 'are', 'worthy', 'pausing', 'looking', 'detail', 'clarity', 'Several', 'other', 'shots', 'different', 'cameras', 'are', 'almost', 'Michael', 'Mann-ish', 'grain', 'coloring', 'so', 'lot', 'film', 'sound', 'mixed', 'bag', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'possibly', 'dangerous', 'depending', 'how', 'high', 'might', 'be', 'cranking', 'hear', 'center', 'channel', 'subtleties', 'laced', '15', 'minutes', 'followed', 'unexpectedly', 'flood', 'high', 'pitches/decibel', 'increase', 'follow', 'hints', 'music', 'when', 'fade', 'lights', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'brightness', 'fading', 'quick', 'turn', 'back', 'down', 'center', 'blown', 'DTS', 'great', 'two', 'main', 'chase', 'sequences', 'motors', 'were', 'overamped', 'just', 'right.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'definitely', 'mixed', 'bag', '*', 'Cut', 'Chase', '4:35', 'minutes', 'Listed', 'first', 'was', 'one', 'had', 'most', 'interest', 'specifically', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', '270', 'actress', 'shot', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'only', 'glossed', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', '30', 'minute', 'piece', 'stunts', 'worthy', 'enough', 'discover', 'sequence', 'was', 'not', 'CGI', '*', 'Driver', 'Irene', '6:14', 'minutes', 'next', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'clip-heavy', 'provide', 'so', 'little', 'substance', 'forgettable', 'one', 'love', 'story', 'angle', 'talking', 'heads', 'clips', '*', 'Hood', '11:50', 'minutes', 'Not', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'was', 'looking', 'car', 'motor', 'info', 'Instead', 'extremely', 'clip-heavy', 'talking', 'head', 'piece', 'actors', 'characters', '*', 'Drive', '5:26', 'minutes', 'confused', 'quip', 'was', 'cut', 'prior', 'segment', 'actors', 'working', 'director', '*', 'Drive', 'Driver', '25:41', 'minutes', 'Wow', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'more', 'boring', 'way', 'get', 'information', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'how', 'was', 'cast', 'so', 'forth', 'director', 'who', 'respect', 'prior', 'work', 'assuredly', 'eye', 'filming', 'sits', 'hood', 'car', 'rambles', '25', 'minutes', 'process', 'essentially', 'commentary', 'interview', 'are', 'fans', 'commentaries', 'am', 'then', 'will', 'dig', 'segment', 'otherwise', 'skipper.Overall', 'fascinating', 'look', 'performance', 'film', 'preserved', 'solid', 'Blu', 'great', 'picture', 'quality', 'test-worthy', 'sound', 'supplements', 'ding', 'being', 'five', 'are', 'half-stars', 'here', '4', 'film', 'BD', 'specs', '.5', 'star', 'supplements']",N/A

There is a feel of stylishness and emotional intensity and sexual subtext and strong violence. However, where this splits from a Mann production is that at times the film has no dialogue &#8211; instead the viewer has to rely on gestures and or facial descriptions and that in its self can be disconcerting. Therefore, it is quite understandable that people will not like this type of storytelling and will reach for volume control on the remote.One of the outstanding scenes was the elevator sequence, which was essentially a series of striking visuals and explicit imagery that&#8217;s a key example of how the film conveys so much through emotions and through the moving image as opposed to the use any spoken narrative.

I fell in love with it in its first five minutes. The movie isn't an action packed extravaganza dripping with testosterone but the opening sequence where the unnamed driver (Ryan Gosling) does his thing as a freelance getaway driver is one of the best openings to a film ever and really helps to sell you on the character and the world he inhabits.I really can't explain what it is about the film that I love so much but there's something about the mood that this film creates and revels in that just wrapped me in its arms and never let me go until the credits started rolling. The music especially makes you feel like you're watching something that would've fit perfectly amidst the roster of films released in the mid to late 80's. It's a haunting film, filled with haunting performances by many fine actors, including Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Oscar Issac, Christina Hendricks and most surprisingly, Albert Brooks. Trust me, after watching this film, you'll never look at Mr. Brooks the same way again as he plays a character way against type in this film. Ryan Gosling has managed to make me a fan based on this film alone, the only thing I've seen him in as of yet. If you like Gosling, I think it's safe to say you'll like him in this as his character is truly a likable fellow, even if he is a little unhinged.In terms of the technical details, this is a fine looking Blu-Ray that sounds pretty fantastic when it needs to. For example, during the aforementioned chase scene there's a helicopter flyover that just fills up the sound stage, making you feel like there's one hovering a few feet above you. This isn't a movie filled with gunfire and explosions but the surround sound is used to great effect, adding an extra dimension to the music and ambiance of the film that is already in place. The extras are okay, with the best feature of the bunch being an interview with director Nicholas Winding Refn, who goes on at length to talk about many of the facets of the production and how the film came about. It's a very interesting discussion, especially if you're a fan of the film.""Drive"" has become one of my absolute favorite films of the past year. I can't even tell you how many times I've seen it since I initially watched it. If you haven't seen it, I say give it a shot. Just don't go in expecting a non-stop action film and take it for what it's worth and I think you'll appreciate it. If you've already seen it and you're interested in picking up the Blu, I feel comfortable in recommending it.

There is also some rather violent stuff here. Be ready for that too.Simple concept: a stuntman/mechanic who lives in a matchbox of an apartment pulls odd jobs on the side. He drives, and he does it well. some of this is legal and some of it is for people puling down robberies. He has a partner, and that partner is tied in with organized crime and those guys are big fish. The big fish decide that our driver is gifted behind the wheel, get involved with his legal career, and all seems to be going well. Things take a turn when neighborly devotion to a con's wife and kid turn into needing to help him out of a spot, and then spiral and get worse.Lots worse.Ryan Gosling was good in this film. He did not have a lot of lines, however, and you could tell that was partially character - motivated and partially mood driven. In some instances this was nice, like in the middle of some action, and some scenes it made a little stale - like sitting around and watching characters not say much. It reminded me of an arthouse film in that respect, relying on expressions given and other mood or familiarity to say things. I'm not sure everyone will enjoy that. There were also other impressive cast members and they did their part as well, making characters that were not unique but that were good enough, illustrating who was a good guy and a bad guy and all the flavors in-between. I'm not saying these are great in any scope, but they pass the bar - even if most of them feel rather shallow. enter Ron Pearlman, yell yell yell. Bad guy, money, anger. You get the idea. It didn't blow me away or anything.The movie itself, once going, was nice to watch. We get some solid effects in the gore department, which I enjoyed a lot, and we get some impressive wheel play. The opening sequence made me think we were going to get going soon, too, but it took some time to set all the pieces. Again, not bad, just something to note. We also get a lot of build into the who and what of the story, fleshing it out a bit. The problem, in some ways, is the amount of time devoted to making a lot of the character bonds develop, and what exactly happens between them. Normally,w hen an hour is devoted to forging a connection, I can feel it. The problem here was the dialog in some respects and possibly some of the choices the movie made in what happened after-the-fact.I'm not saying it was not good, i enjoyed it. I thought it was a solid 4 out of 5, and that a lot of people would like it. That said, some will take exception and not like it for these, and other, reasons. On a day when I wanted what the movie seemed to promise, a thrill ride, I might have been disappointed too. I rented it, so that also made it better - i'm not sure if I would have wanted ownership outright.If expectations are left at the door, you will certainly enjoy it more.",4,More Blood than i figured - in a good way,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,2992,"['were', 'ups', 'downs', 'drive', 'depending', 'how', 'take', 'things', 'brooding', 'silent', 'actor', 'will', 'determine', 'like', 'not', 'also', 'rather', 'violent', 'stuff', 'here', 'Be', 'ready', 'too.Simple', 'concept', 'stuntman/mechanic', 'who', 'matchbox', 'apartment', 'pulls', 'odd', 'jobs', 'side', 'well', 'legal', 'people', 'puling', 'down', 'robberies', 'partner', 'partner', 'tied', 'organized', 'crime', 'guys', 'are', 'big', 'fish', 'big', 'fish', 'decide', 'driver', 'gifted', 'wheel', 'get', 'involved', 'legal', 'career', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'Things', 'take', 'turn', 'when', 'neighborly', 'devotion', 'con', 'wife', 'kid', 'turn', 'needing', 'help', 'spot', 'then', 'spiral', 'get', 'worse.Lots', 'worse.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'lines', 'however', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'partially', 'character', 'motivated', 'partially', 'mood', 'driven', 'instances', 'was', 'nice', 'middle', 'action', 'scenes', 'made', 'little', 'stale', 'sitting', 'around', 'watching', 'characters', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'reminded', 'arthouse', 'film', 'respect', 'relying', 'expressions', 'given', 'other', 'mood', 'familiarity', 'say', 'things', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'were', 'also', 'other', 'impressive', 'cast', 'members', 'did', 'part', 'well', 'making', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'unique', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'illustrating', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'flavors', 'in-between', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'are', 'great', 'scope', 'pass', 'bar', 'even', 'most', 'feel', 'rather', 'shallow', 'enter', 'Ron', 'Pearlman', 'yell', 'yell', 'yell', 'Bad', 'guy', 'money', 'anger', 'get', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'anything.The', 'movie', 'once', 'going', 'was', 'nice', 'watch', 'get', 'solid', 'effects', 'gore', 'department', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'get', 'impressive', 'wheel', 'play', 'opening', 'sequence', 'made', 'think', 'were', 'going', 'get', 'going', 'soon', 'too', 'took', 'time', 'set', 'pieces', 'Again', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'something', 'note', 'also', 'get', 'lot', 'build', 'who', 'what', 'story', 'fleshing', 'out', 'bit', 'problem', 'ways', 'amount', 'time', 'devoted', 'making', 'lot', 'character', 'bonds', 'develop', 'what', 'exactly', 'Normally', 'w', 'hour', 'devoted', 'forging', 'connection', 'can', 'feel', 'problem', 'here', 'was', 'dialog', 'respects', 'possibly', 'choices', 'movie', 'made', 'what', 'happened', 'after-the-fact.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'was', 'solid', '4', '5', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'said', 'will', 'take', 'exception', 'not', 'other', 'reasons', 'day', 'when', 'wanted', 'what', 'movie', 'seemed', 'promise', 'thrill', 'ride', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'too', 'rented', 'also', 'made', 'better', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'ownership', 'outright.If', 'expectations', 'are', 'left', 'door', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'more']",N/A

For the right price and with the right connection, those are services you can obtain once and only once and Ryan Gosling provides them.Starring as a character that is never given a name, Gosling works as a mechanic for Shannon (played by Bryan Cranston) who also allows him to use vehicles brought to his garage for servicing for his illicit activities. In addition, he does the occasional bit of stunt driving for Hollywood films. Not to mention the fact that Shannon's (Cranston's) associate Bernie Rose (played way against type by Albert Brooks) is considering a proposal Shannon made to have Driver race professionally with Bernie (Brooks) as their benefactor. Things appear to be going swimmingly until Driver offers assistance to a neighbor being coerced to perform a robbery. The neighbor, Standard (played by Oscar Isaac), was recently released from prison and fears what his associate will do to his family. A family that Driver became quite close to in the time between when he met them and the day Standard was released.The violence is a little gruesome, and the surreal nature of a character with no name is something that didn't actually strike me until after I left the theater.

Ryan Gosling's laconic hero is a Hollywood stuntman and garage mechanic by day and getaway driver by night, but car action scenes, superb as they are, are sparse and low-key, compared to, say, ""The Transporter."" Based on a James Sallis book, the film is more like a crime noir about a mysterious man, whose past no one really knows.The storyline itself is not very complicated. Some may say it is conventional. Ryan Gosling plays an unnamed protagonist, a driver wearing a scorpion-embroidered jacket, who befriends his next-door neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos).

1509984,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0064NTZJO,Turfseer,"[2, 5]","**This review may contain spoilers**'Drive' is directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, a Danish director known for films with a violent bent. 'Drive' is no exception, as it emulates some of the darker film noirs of the 40s and 50s as well as the neo-noirs of later years. Refn shot 'Drive' in a contemporary Los Angeles but due to the use of an 80s, synth pop score, the story feels like it's more from the 80s rather than today (sounds like some of those synth tracks with the choppy bass parts were 'borrowed' from one of Hall and Oates' more popular hits).For women who might be drawn to the film due to the casting of Ryan ('The Hunk') Gosling in the lead role, be forewarned that 'Drive' is anything but a 'chick flick'. Gosling, in an unnamed part, moonlights as a getaway driver but has more respectable jobs as a part-time stunt driver and auto mechanic. Unfortunately, Gosling has little dialogue and speaks mostly in a monotone. Even worse is Carey Mulligan who plays Irene, the Driver's next door neighbor and mother of a five year old, who appears to drift about in a perpetual stupor (I seem to recall that when Driver crushes the hit man's head in the elevator, Irene backs off in shock but later never discusses or alludes to the incident at all).Things pick up in terms of action when Irene's husband, Standard, is released from prison but is being forced to commit another robbery by a brute named Cook, who claims Standard still owes a debt to former inmate associates who 'protected' him while incarcerated. A normal guy might feel some jealousy when another man encroaches on his territory, but 'Knight-in-Shining Armor' Gosling is ready to help Standard simply because he's taken a real liking to Irene and the kid.'Drive' soon begins to shine through some neat twists and turns in the plot as well as the introduction of cool supporting players who overshadow both Mr. Gosling and Ms. Mulligan. Some critics have argued that the violence in 'Drive' is gratuitous, but I beg to differ. It might be a bit over the top, but is never cartoonish. In fact, the violence underscores the menacing, ruthless character of the antagonists Gosling's Driver must face.Cook beats Standard to a bloody pulp and the shocks are just beginning. There's the big double cross at the pawn shop, where Standard is shot in the back and later Cook's moll, Blanche, is gunned down at the motel room (there was a significant gasp that could be heard throughout the theater from a taken aback audience when the moll is dispatched). Gosling also gets the chance to be ruthless when he works Cook over. Later Bernie (a mobster played by Albert Brooks, who earlier backed the Driver and Shannon, the owner of the auto body shop where the Driver worked, in a joint stock car racing venture) kills Cook by stabbing him in the face. In addition to the aforementioned 'stomping in the elevator' scene, Bernie eliminates Shannon 'mercifully' by slicing his artery, causing the Driver's former pal, to slowly bleed to death.Who would have thought that comedian Albert Brooks, could actually be so good as an amoral crime boss? Bryan Cranston is also excellent as the Driver's seedy employer. Ron Perlman is always great playing the heavy but I would have liked to have seen more of him, as his character Nino's declaration of his Jewishness, remains wholly underdeveloped.The film's climax, where the Driver cuts off Nino's car on the highway, leading to his death by drowning at the hands of the Driver, was quite exciting. Less exciting and more awkward was the Driver's agreement to meet Bernie in public and return the money. For a person as crafty as the driver, didn't he anticipate that Bernie would try and hurt him at the scene of their meeting place? Or is it that he just didn't care? One other thing I wondered about at film's end. If the loot belonged to the east coast Mafia, even though Bernie and Nino were now dead, wouldn't the Mafioso still come looking for the Driver as well as Irene, who they would have discovered was affiliated with him? Thus, how could the Driver ride off into the sunset, knowing full well that Irene was still vulnerable?When I saw the title 'Drive', I expected the film to have many more chase scenes. Fortunately, director Refn took the story in a different direction, emphasizing the rivalry between the Driver and his criminal antagonists. 'Drive' is a film which doesn't have a lot to say. In other words, if you're looking for great 'meaning', you will not find it here. With the exception of the more complex Bernie, its characters are pretty much one-dimensional caricatures, especially the main protagonists, played by Gosling and Mulligan. Nonetheless, in the tradition of some of the great noirs and neo-noirs of the past, 'Drive' manages to be highly entertaining, due to a dynamic plot, that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",3,Dynamic and entertaining neo-noir plot trumps Gosling and Mulligan wooden parts and performances,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,4869,"['**This', 'review', 'may', 'contain',

This throwback offers jagged titles, electronic music, and stylized, Michael Mann-like direction. The carefully lit, composed shots of Gosling looking sullen and tough is an obvious homage to James Dean. What's missing is originality, a unique vision, real drama, and the desire to be anything more than a good-looking, magazine cover-worthy movie. This is a hipster's idea of cool - derivative, shamelessly nostalgic, an appeal for edginess within the safe and familiar, and an infatuation with designer clothing. We all know, from Gosling's first appearance, that he's a handsome bad boy who will be doomed by falling in love, and everything in-between is just a lot of filler violence until that happens. Gosling is also miscast - to make this pretty boy seem tougher than he is, he dons a fright mask and refuses to say more than a few words (like a hipster in a bad neighborhood). The only thing I'd use this movie for is to collect freeze frame shots of Gosling's gorgeous face and hang them up on a wall.

Keep in mind that ""Drive"" although it echoes things like the titles from a film like ""Thief"", ""To Live and Die in L.A."" (a William Friedkin film) and ""Manhunter"" in terms of its soundtrack, titles, asthetics, etc., is an indie film with a distinctive European art house flavor.SPOILERS:The Driver has a specific code for right and wrong that he lives by. Moving out of his isolated world the Driver falls for Irene (Carey Mulligan)a married woman who's ex-con husband Standard (Oscar Issac)ends up spelling trouble when the Driver in an attempt to help Irene acts as a driver for one last job to liberate Irene and her family.END OF SPOILERS""Drive"" is minimalist in every sense of the word from the sparse dialog to the straight forward emotional connection that the Driver develops with those around him from Irene to his employer and friend Shannon (Bryan Cranston). Featuring a terrific supporting cast (Albert Brooks in an unexpected turn as a bad guy, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks in what amounts to a cameo), ""Drive"" won't be for everyone but those who like the unusual mixture of genre action films mixed with art films that Mann helped pioneer back in the 1980's will enjoy this retro thriller.The DVD looks positively stunning with a nice, sharp transfer. Colors vary a bit from the cool surfaces of the night photography to the warmer skin tones during the day sequences of the film. Detail is extremely good throughout with nice skin textures and a fair amount of grain that compliments the gritty feeling of the film.Audio positively pops and pulsates particularly during the action sequences or those where the Driver is cruising the city.Special features include ""I Drive"" which focuses on the inspiration for the film, ""Under the Hood"" focusing on the cars, ""Driver and Irene"" on the pivotal relationship in the film and a nice long interview with director Refn where he discusses his fetish for cars (although he and screenwriter Hossini Amini don't drive)to the genesis of the film (high on medication for a nasty flu bug after a horrible meeting with Gosling Refn was inspired to come up with the basic plot for ""Drive"" when Gosling drove him back to his hotel and that basic outline was incorporated into the script that Amini adapted from James Sallis book).It's a bit disappointing that we don't get an audio commentary and the film comes with the dreaded (by many) Ultraviolet copy that you have to stream live on your portable device but, those two minor drawbacks aside, ""Drive"" is a fascinating combination of 80's retro filmmaking.If the description doesn't sound like it will appeal to you, I'd suggest renting before buying.",4,"An indie minimalist love letter to 80's films like Michael Mann's ""Thief"" with distinctive European flavor",1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,3041,"['Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'Drive', 'minimalist', 'love', 'letter', 'films', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Thief', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Live', 'Die', 'L.A.', 'use', 'pulsating', 'sythesizer', 'music', 'score', 'film', 'riveting', 'action', 'sequences', 'alternating', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'scenes', 'Driver', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'best', 'driving', 'getaway', 'cars', 'Hollywood', 'stunt', 'vehicles', 'Keep', 'mind', 'Drive', 'things', 'titles', 'film', 'Thief', 'Live', 'Die', 'L.A.', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'film', 'Manhunter', 'terms', 'soundtrack', 'titles', 'asthetics', 'etc.', 'indie', 'film', 'distinctive', 'European', 'art', 'house', 'flavor.SPOILERS', 'Driver', 'specific', 'code', 'right', 'wrong', 'Moving', 'isolated', 'world', 'Driver', 'Irene', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'ex-con', 'husband', 'Standard', 'Oscar', 'Issac', 'up', 'spelling', 'trouble', 'when', 'Driver', 'attempt', 'help', 'Irene', 'acts', 'driver', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'liberate', 'Irene', 'family.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Drive', 'minimalist', 'sense', 'word', 'sparse', 'dialog', 'straight', 'forward', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Driver', 'Irene', 'employer', 'friend', 'Shannon', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Featuring', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'bad', 'guy', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'what', 'amounts', 'cameo', 'Drive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'who', 'like', 'unusual', 'mixture', 'genre', 'action', 'films', 'mixed', 'art', 'films', 'Mann', 'helped', 'pioneer', 'back', '1980', 'will', 'enjoy', 'retro', 'thriller.The', 'DVD', 'positively', 'stunning', 'nice', 'sharp', 'transfer', 'Colors', 'vary', 'bit', 'cool', 'surfaces', 'night', 'photography', 'warmer', 'skin', 'tones', 'day', 'sequences', 'film', 'Detail', 'extremely', 'good', 'nice', 'skin', 'textures', 'fair', 'amount', 'grain', 'gritty', 'feeling', 'film.Audio', 'positively', 'pops', 'particularly', 'action', 'sequences', 'where', 'Driver', 'cruising', 'city.Special', 'features', 'include', 'Drive', 'inspiration', 'film', 'Hood', 'focusing', 'cars', 'Driver', 'Irene', 'pivotal', 'relationship', 'film', 'nice', 'long', 'interview', 'director', 'Refn', 'where', 'fetish', 'cars', 'screenwriter', 'Hossini', 'Amini', 'do', ""n't"", 'drive', 'genesis', 'film', 'high', 'medication', 'nasty', 'flu', 'bug', 'horrible', 'meeting', 'Gosling', 'Refn', 'was', 'inspired', 'come', 'up', 'basic', 'plot', 'Drive', 'when', 'Gosling', 'drove', 'back', 'hotel', 'basic', 'outline', 'was', 'incorporated', 'script', 'Amini', 'adapted', 'James', 'Sallis', 'book', '.It', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'dreaded', 'many', 'Ultraviolet', 'copy', 'have', 'stream', 'live', 'portable', 'device', 'two', 'minor', 'drawbacks', 'aside', 'Drive', 'fascinating', 'combination', '80', 'retro', 'description', ""n't"", 'sound', 'will', 'appeal', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'renting', 'buying']",N/A

First, it has lots of action but, unlike the subpar ""Fast & Furious"" movies, there is actual character development in this movie. Many action films, especially in the 21st century, have abandoned character development completely in favor of non-stop CGI effects, 1-second shots before cutting to the next 1-second shot, and little or no reason for the existence of a plot.""Drive"" is an action movie that does not have those 21st century movie cliches and if you expect to see anything like what I mentioned above, then feel free to go and rent or buy a Fast & Furious movie. For the people who deny this is an action movie [by saying its too slow in the middle] are not appreciating or realizing that even the best action movies cannot be 100% action. There has to be character development.The main character (""Driver"") is a complex individual who doesn't say much and doesn't have to. He is a man of action and there's no better lead character to have in an action movie than a man of action. ""Driver"" doesn't talk the talk, ""Driver"" walks the walk. He talks when only absolutely necessary and, when things go haywire, ""Driver"" is not your cardboard action hero who is ""made of stone."" This guy has feelings and can be nervous just like the toughest of the toughest human beings. He has great love, admiration, and respect for people who deserve it and will dish out the revenge needed to anyone who harms either him or the ones he cares for.The soundtrack to the film is unique to any action film. The instrumental music and pink-colored credits reminded me of those great 1980s action movies like William Friedkin's ""To Live and Die in L.A."" and Michael Mann's ""Thief"" - 2 of the greatest action/drama flicks of all time. They had plot, action, and character development just like ""Drive.""This movie gave me hope for future action movies: that movie makers will go back to making good action-packed movies without all of the horrible movie cliches that have plagued recent action films for the last decade.""Driver"" knows how to get things done, knows how to show people a good time, and knows how to survive and provide for himself in this dog-eat-dog world. He reminds me a little bit of the Charles Bronson character (Arthur Bishop) in ""The Mechanic"" - a man who was great at what he does and was not afraid to do whatever was necessary in order to survive and protect himself.A real hero...a real human being...a fantastic movie.",5,A real hero...A real human being,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,2550,"['[', 'are', 'spoilers', 'here', 'Just', 'cold', 'hard', 'facts', 'wonderful', 'movie', ']', 'Drive', 'pleasure', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'lots', 'action', 'subpar', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'movies', 'actual', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'Many', 'action', 'films', 'especially', '21st', 'century', 'have', 'abandoned', 'character', 'development', 'completely', 'favor', 'non-stop', 'CGI', 'effects', '1-second', 'shots', 'cutting', 'next', '1-second', 'shot', 'little', 'reason', 'existence', 'plot', 'Drive', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'have', '21st', 'century', 'movie', 'cliches', 'expect', 'see', 'anything', 'what', 'mentioned', 'above', 'then', 'feel', 'free', 'go', 'rent', 'buy', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'deny', 'action', 'movie', '[', 'saying', 'too', 'slow', 'middle', ']', 'are', 'not', 'appreciating', 'realizing', 'even', 'best', 'action', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'be', '100', '%', 'action', 'be', 'character', 'development.The', 'main', 'character', 'Driver', 'complex', 'individual', 'who', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', ""n't"", 'have', 'man', 'action', 'better', 'lead', 'character', 'have', 'action', 'movie', 'man', 'action', 'Driver', ""n't"", 'talk', 'talk', 'Driver', 'walk', 'when', 'only', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'haywire', 'Driver', 'not', 'cardboard', 'action', 'hero', 'who', 'made', 'stone', 'guy', 'feelings', 'can', 'be', 'nervous', 'just', 'toughest', 'toughest', 'human', 'beings', 'great', 'love', 'admiration', 'respect', 'people', 'who', 'deserve', 'will', 'dish', 'out', 'revenge', 'needed', 'anyone', 'who', 'ones', 'for.The', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'unique', 'action', 'film', 'instrumental', 'music', 'pink-colored', 'credits', 'reminded', 'great', '1980s', 'action', 'movies', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'Live', 'Die', 'L.A.', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Thief', '2', 'greatest', 'action/drama', 'flicks', 'time', 'had', 'plot', 'action', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'Drive', 'movie', 'gave', 'hope', 'future', 'action', 'movies', 'movie', 'makers', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'making', 'good', 'action-packed', 'movies', 'horrible', 'movie', 'cliches', 'have', 'plagued', 'recent', 'action', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'Driver', 'how', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'how', 'show', 'people', 'good', 'time', 'how', 'survive', 'provide', 'dog-eat-dog', 'world', 'little', 'bit', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'character', 'Arthur', 'Bishop', 'Mechanic', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'do', 'was', 'necessary', 'order', 'survive', 'protect', 'himself.A', 'real', 'hero', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'fantastic', 'movie']",N/A

The plot to this movie is stupid.  It's basically a bunch of scenes strung together trying create a story.  Unfortunately it made no sense.  Very little acting was done by the main character, just repeating lines.  In several scenes the main character had long pauses where he just stared off into space and the camera just stayed on his face(Wow, great acting).  Of course maybe that was better than him saying lines because in some scenes he mumbled his lines so bad I couldn't hear or understand what he said.
