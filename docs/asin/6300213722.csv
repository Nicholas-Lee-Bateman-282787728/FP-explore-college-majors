He's having fun, and this isn't just him acting. He loves his character! From that signature twinkle in his eye, to the devilish smile and raised brow, he steals every scene he is in - like he usually does, but he does it so naturally in this film that you don't notice it until its over and try to remember who else was in it. He both stars in and directed this movie, and though I only found one blunder (the hanging gallows doesn't have a trap door) he did a great job. I've watched this movie half a dozen times with various family and friends, and no one comes away disappointed. Christopher Lloyd and John Belushi (his first feature film appearance) are perfectly cast and hilarious. The female lead for the movie was filled by a newcomer, Mary Steenburgen, and I thought this was the only downer of the film because her chemistry with Nicholson was not there. She's a competent actress, but I don't believe she helped make this movie the overall success it should have been for all the other reasons, like the great story, the other supporting characters, the scenery, and 'ol Jack himself. The digital transfer is not great (a little grainy and faded) and the sound is just OK. I needed to have the subtitles option on to make out everything that was being said.

208445,A2SNZYOL209TMD,6300213722,Hobart McShane,"[3, 10]","I saw this flick on HBO when I was in high school many, many years ago.  Jack Nicholson directs as well as stars in this vehicle. I purchased this film because I vaguely recalled a humorous scene where Nicholson voraciously downs half a chicken and then leeringly implores Mary Steenbergen for some dessert. Unfortunately, I didn't recall the rest of the movie in which  Nicholson overacts a great deal and seems to be presenting himself as Charles Manson with a sense of humor.  My mistake for buying this hamfest.  Don't get me wrong; I love Jack Nicholson; I've been a fan of his for years; but, like many actors, he needs a strong director to rein him in to prevent him from doing what he does in this movie, which is overplaying and hamming it up and mugging for the camera.  The movie is actually boring and even tedious at times.  There are glimpses of the Nicholson sly sense of humor, but overall I should have spent my money on something more gratifying, like a tuna fish sandwich.Needless to say, I was disappointed with this movie.  Oh, well; you can't win 'em all.  And, I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most avid Nicholson fan who wants to own all of Jack's films that are out on DVD.  Aside from historical worth and a chance to see a younger, preening, leering, full of himself, salacious, hooting and hollering Jack, I would keep my money if I were you.  Sorry, Jack.  You're great; but you over did it in this one.For the record, Mary Steenbergen is quite good in her usual underplaying, subtle, and quietly sensuous way.  I love her face and never tire of seeing it on screen.  There's something about her that you can't help but adore.  John Belushi is also good in a small part as one of the employed thugs of the law.  Christopher Lloyd is good too as a lawman in a part that precedes his ""Doc Brown"" days from ""Back To The Future.""  The sets are realistic and the terrain is wild and rustic.  The movie is also put together fairly well.  But, like I stated previously, there is just too much Jack; Jack all over the place.  The movie might have turned out better had his character been hanged in the beginning of the film instead of being rescued by an opportunistic Miss Steenbergen.",2,Beware: Over Indulgent Director/Actor Ahead,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,2238,"['saw', 'flick', 'HBO', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'as', 'well', 'stars', 'vehicle', 'purchased', 'film', 'vaguely', 'recalled', 'humorous', 'scene', 'where', 'Nicholson', 'voraciously', 'chicken', 'then', 'leeringly', 'Mary', 'Steenbergen', 'dessert', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'recall', 'rest', 'movie', 'Nicholson', 'great', 'deal', 'be', 'presenting', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'sense', 'humor', 'mistake', 'buying', 'hamfest', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'years', 'many', 'actors', 'strong', 'director', 'rein', 'prevent', 'doing', 'what', 'movie', 'overplaying', 'hamming', 'up', 'mugging', 'camera', 'movie', 'actually', 'boring', 'even', 'tedious', 'times', 'are', 'glimpses', 'Nicholson', 'sly', 'sense', 'humor', 'overall', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'money', 'something', 'more', 'gratifying', 'tuna', 'fish', 'sandwich.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Oh', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', ""'em"", ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'most', 'avid', 'Nicholson', 'fan', 'who', 'own', 'Jack', 'films', 'are', 'out', 'DVD', 'Aside', 'historical', 'worth', 'chance', 'see', 'younger', 'preening', 'leering', 'full', 'salacious', 'hooting', 'hollering', 'Jack', 'would', 'keep', 'money', 'were', 'Sorry', 'Jack', ""'re"", 'great', 'did', 'record', 'Mary', 'Steenbergen', 'quite', 'good', 'usual', 'underplaying', 'subtle', 'quietly', 'sensuous', 'way', 'love', 'face', 'never', 'tire', 'seeing', 'screen', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'adore', 'John', 'Belushi', 'also', 'good', 'small', 'part', 'one', 'employed', 'thugs', 'law', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'good', 'too', 'lawman', 'part', 'Doc', 'Brown', 'days', 'Back', 'Future', 'sets', 'are', 'realistic', 'terrain', 'wild', 'rustic', 'movie', 'also', 'put', 'together', 'fairly', 'well', 'stated', 'previously', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'place', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'better', 'had', 'character', 'been', 'hanged', 'beginning', 'film', 'instead', 'being', 'rescued', 'opportunistic', 'Miss', 'Steenbergen']",N/A

It's hard not to watch and think of how great it could have been with a better script, and a more experioenced director (this was Jack's first time). Fantastic characters and situations, and worth seeing, of course, because of the talent involved. Jack Nicholson's chemistry with the wonderful Mary Steenburgen is crucial to the film's success, and for that it's worth a second viewing. These are the sort of roles that both actors are best at: Nicholson, a complete rogue, yet compelling and likeable; and Steenburgen, noble, principled and sweet. It's a good combination.Steenburgen plays the virginal Julia Tate, who saves Nicholson (Henry Moon) from the gallows by marrying him to work her gold mine. She spends much of the film denying/fighting her true feelings for him, as a bunch of western bad guys (including a member of Moon's old gang, played by the always relaible Danny DeVito) threaten her safety and livelihood.Average DVD transfer, and a lack of DVD extras lost this one a star.

208454,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6300213722,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 6]","""Goin' South"" is a Western-Comedy directed and starring Jack Nicholson, in his directorial debut. Nicholson has only directed two films (the other one being the Chinatown sequel, The Two Jakes) and both of them are really good projects. Especially this one. I don't much like Western-Comedies; They all have that same mood and they, usually, play it way too goofy. This movie has its moments of goofiness, but it's actually pretty funny and charming. If Nicholson hadn't played so many memorable characters already (R.P. McMurphy, Jack Torrance, Warren Schmidt, Jake Gittes, etc.) than you could call his Henry Moon one of his most memorable creations. Anyway, Henry Moon is an outlaw. A robber of banks and stealer of horses. When the law finally catches him, he's sentenced to hang. As he's being led to the gallows, he discovers a loophole. If a woman who owns property agrees to marry him, he doesn't have to swing. After an old lady volunteers, but quickly dies, Julia Tate (Mary Steenburgen, in her debut film role) takes Henry under her wing and marries him. She doesn't marry Henry because she couldn't stand the thought of him dying or because she particularly likes him, but because she needs finding gold in the mines on her property. Henry doesn't mind much, but he's disappointed at the lack of affection the wife is showing her husband. Matters are made worse when the railroad evicts her and two boneheaded lawmen (Christopher Lloyd and John Belushi) are always trying to arrest Henry. Also, Henry's former gang (two of the members include Danny DeVito and Veronica Cartwright) wants in on some of the gold he's been discovering. The movie's humor is hit-and-miss, and I'd be lying to you if I said it didn't miss a lot...It does. But the stuff that hits is pretty funny and the movie is well written, entertaining, and charming enough to get a high grade from me. Jack Nicholson and Mary Steenburgen have good chemistry onscreen and Lloyd & Belushi are so goofy, that they're hilarious. The movie isn't perfect, but it's highly enjoyable. Besides, the DVD is cheap and it's worth the money.GRADE: A-",5,A Fun Western-Comedy,1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,2115,"['Goin', 'South', 'Western-Comedy', 'directed', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Nicholson', 'only', 'directed', 'two', 'films', 'other', 'one', 'being', 'Chinatown', 'sequel', 'Two', 'Jakes', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'projects', 'Especially', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'Western-Comedies', 'have', 'same', 'mood', 'usually', 'play', 'way', 'too', 'goofy', 'movie', 'moments', 'goofiness', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'charming', 'Nicholson', 'had', ""n't"", 'played', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'characters', 'already', 'R.P', 'McMurphy', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'Warren', 'Schmidt', 'Jake', 'Gittes', 'etc', 'could', 'call', 'Henry', 'Moon', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'creations', 'Anyway', 'Henry', 'Moon', 'outlaw', 'robber', 'banks', 'stealer', 'horses', 'When', 'law', 'finally', 'sentenced', 'hang', 'being', 'led', 'gallows', 'loophole', 'woman', 'who', 'property', 'agrees', 'marry', ""n't"", 'have', 'swing', 'old', 'lady', 'volunteers', 'quickly', 'dies', 'Julia', 'Tate', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'debut', 'film', 'role', 'Henry', 'wing', 'marries', ""n't"", 'marry', 'Henry', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'thought', 'dying', 'particularly', 'likes', 'finding', 'gold', 'mines', 'property', 'Henry', ""n't"", 'mind', 'much', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'affection', 'wife', 'showing', 'husband', 'Matters', 'are', 'made', 'worse', 'when', 'railroad', 'two', 'boneheaded', 'lawmen', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'John', 'Belushi', 'are', 'always', 'trying', 'arrest', 'Henry', 'Also', 'Henry', 'former', 'gang', 'two', 'members', 'include', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'gold', 'been', 'discovering', 'movie', 'humor', 'hit-and-miss', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'lot', 'stuff', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'well', 'written', 'entertaining', 'charming', 'enough', 'get', 'high', 'grade', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'onscreen', 'Lloyd', 'Belushi', 'are', 'so', 'goofy', ""'re"", 'hilarious', 'movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'cheap', 'money.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

208461,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6300213722,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[1, 1]","First off, there's Jack as the male lead (he also directed). But then you also got John Belushi in his movie debut (lot of people don't know this), Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen in HER movie debut, Ed Begley Jr., Danny DeVito, Vernonica Cartwright, and some strong actors in other supporting roles--Tracey Walter and R.L. Armstrong. It's a lot of fun to see Belushi and DeVito do their thing here, and Jack is also a lot of fun to watch.This 1978 film is an interesting companion piece to his other Western done around the same time, The Missouri Breaks, a much more serious film. Goin' South has some punchy comedy stuff in it, thanks to the Mary Steenburgen character's on-again, off-again ""romance"" with her newly chosen husband, Jack--whom she marries just so he'll help her get the gold out of a mine on her land. Connubial bliss is far from her thoughts, in fact.The swinging back and forth between Jack and Mary hitting it off and at real odds with each other is further compounded by the two ornery deputies in town, played by Christopher Lloyd and John Belushi (a Mexican converted to American deputy status--don't ask), AND by Jack's former gang--Danny DeVito, Vernoica Cartwright, Tracey Walter, and another guy--and this back and forth also keeps the movie swingin' away at comic situations. An especially funny scene has the outlaws and the two deputies shooting at each other over a short roof.The ending is kind of abrupt, but bearing in mind this was the 70s when the movie was made--and that the director was Jack himself--it's OK, or even better than OK. The parallels to The Missouri Breaks are found in Jack's attraction to a strong-willed woman, his involvement (former or current) with a gang, a Western setting, and a connection--good, bad, or indifferent--to a wealthy man (landowner or railroad representative).While The Missouri Breaks is a much stronger film--not the least reason for which is the presence of the amazing Marlon Brando in it--Goin' South has a lot of goofy charm and is definitely worth seeing.",4,What a cast!,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2044,"['First', 'off', 'Jack', 'male', 'lead', 'also', 'directed', 'then', 'also', 'got', 'John', 'Belushi', 'movie', 'debut', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'HER', 'movie', 'debut', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Vernonica', 'Cartwright', 'strong', 'actors', 'other', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Tracey', 'Walter', 'R.L', 'Armstrong', 'lot', 'fun', 'see', 'Belushi', 'DeVito', 'do', 'thing', 'here', 'Jack', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch.This', '1978', 'film', 'interesting', 'companion', 'piece', 'other', 'Western', 'done', 'same', 'time', 'Missouri', 'Breaks', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'film', 'Goin', 'South', 'punchy', 'comedy', 'stuff', 'thanks', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'character', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'romance', 'newly', 'chosen', 'husband', 'Jack', 'whom', 'just', 'so', ""'ll"", 'help', 'get', 'gold', 'mine', 'land', 'Connubial', 'bliss', 'far', 'thoughts', 'fact.The', 'swinging', 'back', 'forth', 'Jack', 'Mary', 'hitting', 'off', 'real', 'odds', 'other', 'further', 'compounded', 'two', 'ornery', 'deputies', 'town', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Mexican', 'converted', 'American', 'deputy', 'status', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Jack', 'former', 'gang', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Vernoica', 'Cartwright', 'Tracey', 'Walter', 'guy', 'back', 'forth', 'also', 'movie', 'swingin', 'away', 'comic', 'situations', 'especially', 'funny', 'scene', 'outlaws', 'two', 'deputies', 'shooting', 'other', 'short', 'roof.The', 'ending', 'kind', 'abrupt', 'bearing', 'mind', 'was', '70s', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'director', 'was', 'Jack', 'OK', 'even', 'better', 'OK', 'parallels', 'Missouri', 'Breaks', 'are', 'found', 'Jack', 'attraction', 'strong-willed', 'woman', 'involvement', 'former', 'current', 'gang', 'Western', 'setting', 'connection', 'good', 'bad', 'indifferent', 'wealthy', 'man', 'landowner', 'railroad', 'representative', 'Missouri', 'Breaks', 'much', 'stronger', 'film', 'not', 'least', 'reason', 'presence', 'amazing', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Goin', 'South', 'lot', 'goofy', 'charm', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

But when he hears about the town law that states any woman who owns land can save a man from execution by offering herself in marriage to him, things are looking up. And wouldn't you know it, right before the hatch is dropped, a young lady named Julia (Mary Steenburgen) speaks up and takes the outlaw into her legal custody. But it turns out she's got a bit of a cold motive. She firmly believes that there's gold somewhere within the mines of her property -- gold that her now deceased father searched for all his life but never uncovered. She employs her new ""husband"" to help dig. At first, this partnership is set for destruction with obvious differences between the two. But before long it seems that things might work out differently than expected. Can the rugged Moon come to find the heart to settle down for a woman he might actually have true feelings for?

But being a sucker for anything Jack's layed his hands on, I knew I had to try this. After all, it's 1978 -- post One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and pre The Shining. In his early fourties, is this not the golden stage of his iconic charisma? Well, Goin' South was no classic, but it sure put a smile on my face.I was worried because of the plotline that there would be too much romance. Not so. Although there's a strong love story twisted in there, there are plenty of laughs to be had and very little (if any) mushy-mushy junk. The storyline unfolds nicely, employing plenty of memorable scenes with some pretty funny material. With a supporting cast of Christopher Lloyd, John Belushi, Danny DeVito, and Veronica Cartwright, the mood was set for a feel-good mix of knee-slapping comedy and interesting characters.The only thing I found a bit annoying was what other reviewers have frequently mentioned -- Jack's voice. It's not the Southern accent that throws you off, it's the fact that he sounds like he's got a cold. There are a few scenes where he seems clearer, yet most of the time he speaks with a huffy sound like he was just recovering from a winter flu. I don't know if he intended it that way, or if some of the *ahem* substances *ahem* of that time took a slight toll on his voice. Either way, it's not so distracting that it would ruin his lines, but it is a disapointment since he has such a nice natural tone.As for the DVD, the picture and audio quality are superb. However, there are no special features. It's the only edition out right now, and probably will be the only one out ever. Still, the film makes up for any lacking in extras.",4,"For A Fairly Obscure Nicholson Flick, This One's Pretty Impressive",1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,2831,"['Plot', 'Henry', 'Lloyd', 'Moon', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'outlaw', 'dreams', 'escaping', 'Mexico', 'set', 'be', 'hanged', 'when', 'town', 'law', 'woman', 'who', 'land', 'can', 'save', 'man', 'execution', 'offering', 'marriage', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'right', 'hatch', 'dropped', 'young', 'lady', 'named', 'Julia', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'up', 'outlaw', 'legal', 'custody', 'out', 'got', 'bit', 'cold', 'motive', 'firmly', 'gold', 'somewhere', 'mines', 'property', 'gold', 'now', 'deceased', 'father', 'searched', 'life', 'never', 'uncovered', 'new', 'husband', 'help', 'dig', 'first', 'partnership', 'set', 'destruction', 'obvious', 'differences', 'two', 'long', 'things', 'might', 'work', 'out', 'differently', 'expected', 'Can', 'rugged', 'Moon', 'come', 'find', 'heart', 'settle', 'down', 'woman', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'true', 'feelings', 'really', 'just', 'tool', 'selfish', 'intentions', 'destined', 'fulfill', 'lonesome', 'dreams', 'going', 'south', 'border', 'continue', 'ways', 'rebellion', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'much', 'movie', 'being', 'sucker', 'anything', 'Jack', 'layed', 'hands', 'knew', 'had', 'try', '1978', 'post', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'pre', 'Shining', 'early', 'fourties', 'not', 'golden', 'stage', 'iconic', 'charisma', 'Well', 'Goin', 'South', 'was', 'classic', 'sure', 'put', 'smile', 'face.I', 'was', 'worried', 'plotline', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'romance', 'Not', 'so', 'strong', 'love', 'story', 'twisted', 'there', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'mushy-mushy', 'junk', 'storyline', 'nicely', 'employing', 'plenty', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'pretty', 'funny', 'material', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'mood', 'was', 'set', 'feel-good', 'mix', 'knee-slapping', 'comedy', 'interesting', 'characters.The', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'bit', 'annoying', 'was', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'frequently', 'mentioned', 'Jack', 'voice', 'not', 'Southern', 'accent', 'off', 'fact', 'got', 'cold', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'clearer', 'yet', 'most', 'time', 'huffy', 'sound', 'was', 'just', 'recovering', 'winter', 'flu', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'intended', 'way', '*ahem*', 'substances', '*ahem*', 'time', 'took', 'slight', 'toll', 'voice', 'way', 'not', 'so', 'distracting', 'would', 'ruin', 'lines', 'disapointment', 'nice', 'natural', 'tone.As', 'DVD', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'superb', 'However', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'edition', 'right', 'now', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'ever', 'Still', 'film', 'up', 'lacking', 'extras']",N/A
