I was even more ecstatic when I found that it was created as a spin-off/sequel of sorts to the original show. After watching the first AYBS series over and over again for 20 years, it was like a surprise of hidden episodes to watch Are You Being Served Again (aka Grace and Favor).Set in the British countryside instead of a department store, the cast sort of all go into retirement together. Living in a manor house, they set it up as a bed and breakfast of sorts and cater to tour groups. With the cast of the original series having spent so many years together living their parts, they do a flawless job of seaming the first series into this second one.The episodes are very humerus and my only complaint is that they didn't make even more of them. I would have liked to see Mr. Lucas join the cast, but the others more than make up for his absence.

That said, if you haven't ever seen the first series (Are You Being Served?), then you'll probably be out in the dark.For those of us who only saw the original and this series in the U.S. courtesy of PBS or BBC America, we don't realize that there was such a long time between their original British airing and our viewing. While I can only speak for myself and those who I know feel the same way, the staff and management of Grace Brothers department store will always have a warm place in my heart. Full of double entendre and slighty (ever so slightly) bawdy behavior, the original and this sequel series are such fantastic products that the U.K. should create a special room for them in the BBC Hall of Fame.The remaining staff of Grace Brothers is let go from the store as it closes its doors after the death of Young Mr. Grace. Having put money into their pension funds for so many years the staff is eager to learn what they'll receive. What they receive is a country manor house that operates, ever so barely, as a bed and breakfast way out in the British countryside. Unable to recover their investment through its sale, the determine to live there and run it as a business to fund their retirement. Hilarity ensues.The series is basically a chronological day after day series of events that find our cast in a variety of prickly situations.Mrs. Slocumb, Mr. Humphries, Capt. Peacock, Miss Brahm, and Mr. Rumbold are all back. They are joined by the very eccentric and odiferous groundskeeper, Mr. Moulterd, and his daughter, Mavis. Also along for the ride is the very sexy ex mistress (she was really the cause of Mr. Grace's demise), Miss Lovelock.The sets are wonderful and the costumes age appropriate, but the humor is still the same old fun.I guarantee that you'll love seeing your friends again and you'll wish that they'd get together and do another series.A+",5,Brilliant!

Peacock, Mrs. Slocombe, Mr. Humphries, Miss Brahms and Mr. Grace's 'nurse du jour' Miss Lovelock.  The staff learns that their pensions will keep them just off the dole and that their primary asset is Millstone Manor, a country bed and breakfast held in trust with Mr. Rumpold as manager.  When they arrive to inspect the property they find the establishment in a shambles and Miss Lovelock in permanent residence.  The group decides to run the manor with the aid of Mr. Moulterd, the home farm manager and his daughter Mavis.As with the original series there are a series of running gags, some carried over from the original series.  Mr. Rumpbold is still an incompetent bore, Capt. Peacock a skirt chaser, Mrs. Slocombe still fusses over her pussy, Miss Brahms continues to have things 'get up her nose' and Mr. Humphries' mother continues to supervise him from a distance.  While still an ensemble piece the focus is very much on Humphries and his relationship with Mavis Moulterd.  While still very much 'neither here nor there' the two share a bed and many clever double entenderes.This series is as hilarious as the original series.  We are treated to glimpses into some more of their lives and would probably had gotten more had the series continued.  Sadly the series only ran 12 episodes, long before it considered all its possibilities.  I would have liked to learn what happened to some of the other Grace Bros. staff, (Mr. Harmon, Mr. Lucas and others) and find out what happened to Peacock and Rumpold's wives.  There was still lots to be said about Mr. Humphries and Mavis, Capt. Peacock and Miss Lovelock and Mrs. Slocombe and Mr. Moulterd.I would recommend this to fans of the original series and also to those of TO THE MANOR BORN.",5,The further adventures of the Grace Bros. staff,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,2173,"['ARE', 'YOU', 'BEING', 'SERVED', 'AGAIN', 'aka', 'GRACE', 'FAVOUR', 'adventures', 'Grace', 'Bros.', 'Dept', 'Store', 'staff', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'BEING', 'SERVED', 'fame', 'Mr.', 'Grace', 'finally', 'passed', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'circumstances', 'invested', 'Grace', 'Bros.', 'pension', 'fund', 'unconventional', 'ways', 'beneficiaries', 'scheme', 'are', 'loyal', 'employees', 'who', 'remained', 'store', 'closing', 'day', 'Mr.', 'Rumpold', 'Capt', 'Peacock', 'Mrs.', 'Slocombe', 'Mr.', 'Humphries', 'Miss', 'Brahms', 'Mr.', 'Grace', ""'nurse"", 'du', 'jour', 'Miss', 'Lovelock', 'staff', 'pensions', 'will', 'keep', 'just', 'dole', 'primary', 'asset', 'Millstone', 'Manor', 'country', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'held', 'trust', 'Mr.', 'Rumpold', 'manager', 'When', 'arrive', 'inspect', 'property', 'find', 'establishment', 'shambles', 'Miss', 'Lovelock', 'permanent', 'residence', 'group', 'run', 'manor', 'aid', 'Mr.', 'Moulterd', 'home', 'farm', 'manager', 'daughter', 'Mavis.As', 'original', 'series', 'are', 'series', 'running', 'gags', 'carried', 'original', 'series', 'Mr.', 'Rumpbold', 'still', 'incompetent', 'bore', 'Capt', 'Peacock', 'skirt', 'chaser', 'Mrs.', 'Slocombe', 'still', 'pussy', 'Miss', 'Brahms', 'have', 'things', ""'get"", 'up', 'nose', 'Mr.', 'Humphries', 'mother', 'supervise', 'distance', 'still', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'focus', 'very', 'much', 'Humphries', 'relationship', 'Mavis', 'Moulterd', 'still', 'very', 'much', ""'neither"", 'here', 'there', 'two', 'share', 'bed', 'many', 'clever', 'double', 'entenderes.This', 'series', 'as', 'hilarious', 'original', 'series', 'are', 'treated', 'glimpses', 'more', 'lives', 'would', 'probably', 'had', 'gotten', 'more', 'had', 'series', 'continued', 'Sadly', 'series', 'only', 'ran', '12', 'episodes', 'long', 'considered', 'possibilities', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'Grace', 'Bros.', 'staff', 'Mr.', 'Harmon', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'others', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Peacock', 'Rumpold', 'wives', 'was', 'still', 'lots', 'be', 'said', 'Mr.', 'Humphries', 'Mavis', 'Capt', 'Peacock', 'Miss', 'Lovelock', 'Mrs.', 'Slocombe', 'Mr.', 'Moulterd.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'also', 'TO', 'THE', 'MANOR', 'BORN']",N/A

It is not. On a personal note... Mr. Lucus (Trevor Bannister) I very much missed in this series. It would have been a bit better with him. They tried to get Trevor but he felt his charactor was a little too old now to chase girls around. ""As the young Mr.Lucus it was funny, Now HE would come off as just a dirty old man.""

Neither does Mr. Spooner the replacement for Lucus in the old series.  Mr. Humphries comes across as a caricature as opposed to a likeable odd fellow in the original series.  The whole bit with pretending to ""go straight"" just does not work.  His  ""todos"" with the village ""girl"" Mavis come across as gross overacting.  After the second episode one can predict what his lines are and the sexual innuendoes get tiresome.Mrs. Slocum is the bright star.  Though not as sprightly as the original series; her role seems to fit.  She is adorable and funny in spite of the tired line about ""my pussy"".Mr. Peacock seems held back.  His role here is quite stunted and would have been a great enhancement to the series had the director made more of his relationship with Miss  Lovelock.  Much potential was wasted here.Mr. Rumbold's contribution to the series is moderate and again undermined.  My guess is the producers tried to revolve the whole series around Mr. Humphries and thus stunted the plots.Miss. Brahms is passable and plays a rather bland supporting role.Mr. Moulterd is hilarious.  A genuine way-out kind of  a fellow who really adds to the show.

I've been laughing at every episode so far. Yes, it's different from the series, but I like the country atmosphere where they are out of their comfort zone & Mrs. Slocumb & Mr. Humphries don't disappoint. Mavis & Mr. Moulterd [love his name] are interesting additions. It's sad watching & knowing that only a couple of the actors are still alive [although I haven't recently checked to see who is still alive].As for Trevor Bannister, I'm sure there could have been a storyline for him. He was originally cast as the star of Are You Being Served. The show was supposed to have revolved around him, but John Inman stole that show from him. As for the character of Mr. Spooner, he really didn't add anything, seemed like a duck out of water. The rest of the cast had great chemistry & a sense of family about them.If you are a die hard fan of AYBS? you may enjoy this trip down memory lane.

832800,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B0002F6BT2,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[157, 161]","I am very happy that this adorable BBC series is now available on DVD.  For fans of Are You Being Served?, Grace and Favour (known as AYBS? Again! in the USA) was a fun way to see Mr. Humphries, Miss Brahms, Capt. Peacock, Mrs. Slocombe, and Mr. Rumbold together again.  Yes, there are often the same old jokes like the stuck elevator and Capt. Peacocks womanizing, but the new setting brought a lot of freshness to the show.  The Grace Bros. employees who stuck with the company until its closing (which, of course, does not include Mr. Lucas; Trevor Bannister probably would not have done this show anyway) receive, as their pension, a country manor house.  They must abandon past titles (however reluctantly) and work together so that the manor house earns money.  The best part of the series is the adorable character Mavis Moulterd, daughter of the gruff farmer of Millstone Manor (played by Fleur Bennett).  As is customary, she shares the bed with the chef.  Of course, with the staff quitting after meeting Mr. Rumbold, Mr. Humphries is given the chef's quarters.  The sexual, but in a cute way, tension between Mavis and Mr. Humphries really makes the show. The rich colors of the countryside also make this series refreshing when compared to the monotonous store setting of AYBS?  Plus, we finally get to see Mrs. Slocombe's pussy[cat]!The DVD includes all 12 of the episodes that were originally aired on BBC in 1992-93.  The first episode can also be found as an extra on the DVD set for seasons 6-10 of AYBS?  The menu page is a little awkward to use when choosing an episode. To pick  an individual episode, you click the arrow key on the DVD remote the number of times to correspond to the episode number on the disc (i.e. 5 times to get episode #5).  Other than that, the shows play great.  The extras include cast bios (only a list of T.V. and film appearances which was disappointing) and trailers of other BBC shows. I wish there was more on the history of the series. For more on this show, see volume 7 of the first AYBS? DVD box set where John Inman talks a little bit about it in an interview. Lack of extras aside, if you like the characters of AYBS?, you will like AYBS?

Even though our beloved cast of characters has visibly aged, the storyline picks up immediately after the closing of Grace Brothers Department Store. They have come together again to find out how Mr. Grace handled their retirement money. Not very well apparently, as the crew inherits a broken down country mansion in place of their much deserved pensions.They hit upon the idea of opening the mansion to the general public as a bed and breakfast, with the intent of not only &#34;copping the lolly&#34; from their guests, but enjoying free room and board for themselves.The series ran for just a single season. And, while it has more charm then belly laughs, if you watched the entire Are You Being Served? series, your genuine love for the characters and the actors who played them is more than enough to make you want still more episodes of Are You Being Served, Again? It is a wonderful reprise of our beloved cast of characters and perhaps the finest comedians Britain has ever produced.
