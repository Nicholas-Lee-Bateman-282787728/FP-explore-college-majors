1385024,A111TATNFNSU3X,B0044BX4A4,Knight Poet,"[2, 4]","This movie appeared to me to be a strange combination of a devilishly dark comedy blended with the bloody gore of cheap horror flicks but with minute sprinklings of philosophy on top. The end result was an incoherent display of cinematic chaos that was disappointing to say the least. The philosophical elements touched upon the controversial subject of predestination where it would not matter what we choose in the realm of Good versus Evil because that is what was supposed to happen no matter what as though such choosing was already determined in advance by Fate as opposed to us being boldly empowered by our Infinite Creator with the unconditional gift of free-will whereby at least as far as our eternal destinies are concerned, WE decide the finality of our fate by our final decisions (preferably based on the experiential wisdom of cosmic enlightenment learned in part from the previous selection of unwise choices that are the inevitable result of being born in the cradle of imperfection), choosing either to forever EMBRACE or forever REJECT Truth, Beauty and Goodness (more gifts from God, the Giver of all Life) thereby surviving our trial trip in the flesh to continue our adventurous journey towards God by progressively becoming more like Him. I perceive the plan of Paradise ascension as having been preordained (God thought about it first and then had His Architects draw up the blueprints for The Plan) but our personal participation in this plan is NOT preordained (even if God should foreknow the freewill acts of His children, such foreknowledge does not in the least abrogate our freedom to choose). As you can probably tell by now, I reject the false teaching that we have no say in the matter when it comes to choosing Good over Evil and faithfully believing in the spiritual reality of God instead of the lifeless theories of a mechanistic materialism that are filled with dead notions that deny and then lie by seeing only with one blinded eye.",1,Philosophically Speaking,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1974,"['movie', 'appeared', 'be', 'strange', 'combination', 'devilishly', 'dark', 'comedy', 'blended', 'bloody', 'gore', 'cheap', 'horror', 'flicks', 'minute', 'sprinklings', 'philosophy', 'top', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'incoherent', 'display', 'cinematic', 'chaos', 'was', 'disappointing', 'say', 'least', 'philosophical', 'elements', 'touched', 'controversial', 'subject', 'predestination', 'where', 'would', 'not', 'matter', 'what', 'choose', 'realm', 'Good', 'versus', 'Evil', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'happen', 'matter', 'what', 'such', 'choosing', 'was', 'already', 'determined', 'advance', 'Fate', 'opposed', 'being', 'boldly', 'empowered', 'Infinite', 'Creator', 'unconditional', 'gift', 'free-will', 'whereby', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'eternal', 'destinies', 'are', 'concerned', 'WE', 'decide', 'finality', 'fate', 'final', 'decisions', 'preferably', 'based', 'experiential', 'wisdom', 'cosmic', 'enlightenment', 'learned', 'part', 'previous', 'selection', 'unwise', 'choices', 'are', 'inevitable', 'result', 'being', 'born', 'cradle', 'imperfection', 'choosing', 'forever', 'EMBRACE', 'forever', 'REJECT', 'Truth', 'Beauty', 'Goodness', 'more', 'gifts', 'God', 'Giver', 'Life', 'thereby', 'surviving', 'trial', 'trip', 'flesh', 'continue', 'adventurous', 'journey', 'towards', 'God', 'progressively', 'becoming', 'more', 'Him', 'perceive', 'plan', 'Paradise', 'ascension', 'having', 'been', 'preordained', 'God', 'thought', 'first', 'then', 'had', 'Architects', 'draw', 'up', 'blueprints', 'Plan', 'personal', 'participation', 'plan', 'NOT', 'preordained', 'even', 'God', 'should', 'foreknow', 'freewill', 'acts', 'children', 'such', 'foreknowledge', 'not', 'least', 'abrogate', 'freedom', 'choose', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', 'now', 'reject', 'false', 'teaching', 'have', 'say', 'matter', 'when', 'choosing', 'Good', 'Evil', 'faithfully', 'believing', 'spiritual', 'reality', 'God', 'instead', 'lifeless', 'theories', 'mechanistic', 'materialism', 'are', 'filled', 'dead', 'notions', 'deny', 'then', 'lie', 'seeing', 'only', 'one', 'blinded', 'eye']",N/A
1385025,A1JUS0D90TILIA,B0044BX4A4,Mr. Wan,"[2, 3]","DO not buy this movie because you like Zach Galifianakis or his type of humor.  This is more very dark humor, people getting killed, gruesome dead bodies, and violence. This movie is about two friends that just go around talking to each other while one of them spouts out his theories on life and death. It did have some funny moments, but they were few and far between and again, not ""happy"" comedy.  The only parts I thought were funny were the parts involving the ""Dennis"" show.  In the movie, there's parts involving a ""Montel Williams"" type show but it's called ""Dennis Rivers.""  The subject is kids that kill their parents and there's one quiet ashamed kid as a guest who killed his parents.  One of the women in the audience gets up and says ""killing your parents is just wrong kid!""So there are very small bits of humor such as that but they are few and far between.  In another scene, the two friends are on separate beds and the camera scrolls down to the floor between the beds, as they go on their ramblings about life... and there sets the body of a dead women they act obvlivious to.It takes a certain type of behavior to enjoy type of movie... it's not for me.

1385027,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0044BX4A4,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","If you are a big fan of indie films steep in symbolism and Milton; one that makes you say WTF at the end of the movie, you might try this slow mover with tons of dialouge and f-bombs. Jack and Stephen are friends and while polar opposites they seem to know each other extremely well. Jack, who is filled with positive karma, although not all good, is always situated on the right side of Stephen who is filled with negative energy. Zach Galifanakis plays an adult store owner who deals to children and also sells drugs. There are two subplots that run through the story also. Tommy, the cop is investigating the disappearance of a girl and talk show host Dennis River (Jerry Springer type) somehow has a kid on stage who has admitted killing his parents. They all eventually come together. Much of the story is conversation between Jack and Stephen. The adult book store robbery was comical, but after that the comedy dies. The symbolism on the box is somewhat of a plot spoiler as Jack is made to look like the devil and Stephen the angel. There is a difference between being bad and acting bad, as the movie attempts to point out. At one point Jack almost quotes a Rolling Stone line, ""Please to meet you, guess my name"" from Sympathy for the Devil. Jack is a nickname for Satan. While attempting to figure out evil, Stephen Sweet asks Jack ""Is masturbation evil?"" Jack answers, ""According to my mother, yes. Thank God she is dead.""After watching this movie I didn't know if I loved it or hated it. But I do know I won't be able to sit through it again to find out.",3,EVIL BEGETS EVIL,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,1567,"['are', 'big', 'fan', 'indie', 'films', 'steep', 'symbolism', 'Milton', 'one', 'say', 'WTF', 'end', 'movie', 'might', 'try', 'slow', 'mover', 'tons', 'dialouge', 'f-bombs', 'Jack', 'Stephen', 'are', 'friends', 'polar', 'opposites', 'seem', 'know', 'other', 'extremely', 'well', 'Jack', 'who', 'filled', 'positive', 'karma', 'not', 'good', 'always', 'situated', 'right', 'side', 'Stephen', 'who', 'filled', 'negative', 'energy', 'Zach', 'Galifanakis', 'adult', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'children', 'also', 'drugs', 'are', 'two', 'subplots', 'run', 'story', 'also', 'Tommy', 'cop', 'investigating', 'disappearance', 'girl', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'Dennis', 'River', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'type', 'somehow', 'kid', 'stage', 'who', 'admitted', 'killing', 'parents', 'eventually', 'come', 'together', 'Much', 'story', 'conversation', 'Jack', 'Stephen', 'adult', 'book', 'store', 'robbery', 'was', 'comical', 'comedy', 'dies', 'symbolism', 'box', 'somewhat', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'Jack', 'made', 'look', 'devil', 'Stephen', 'angel', 'difference', 'being', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'movie', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'point', 'Jack', 'almost', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'line', 'Please', 'meet', 'guess', 'name', 'Sympathy', 'Devil', 'Jack', 'nickname', 'Satan', 'attempting', 'figure', 'out', 'evil', 'Stephen', 'Sweet', 'Jack', 'masturbation', 'evil', 'Jack', 'answers', 'According', 'mother', 'yes', 'Thank', 'God', 'dead', 'watching', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'loved', 'hated', 'do', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'again', 'find', 'out']",N/A
