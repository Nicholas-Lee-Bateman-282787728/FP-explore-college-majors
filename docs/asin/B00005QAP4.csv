It makes a lot of noise that adds nothing to the plot. Sheryl Lee (probably spelled that wrong) apparently has been scrabbling for a paycheck ever since Twin Peaks and it depresses me to see her act at all since that effort. There's a few other ""never rans"" in this that seem to really be trying but all for nought. I think Mickey Rourke is usually interesting, even in bad movies and he was in this one, too.

674049,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005QAP4,Michael Butts,"[11, 13]","FALL TIME is an interesting and different movie, at times implausible, but infused with a sense of loss and despair.  The three boys who play the teenagers do a commendable job:  Jason London as the educated, uppity-at-times Tim; David Arquette as the prankster in charge David; and Jonah Bleckman as the put-upon Joe.  Their latest prank proves to be their last as they cross paths with two homosexual bank robbers.  The homosexual theme is underplayed and much innuendo abounds, but there's a sincerity to their relationship that makes it believable.  Stephen Baldwin and Mickey Rourke play the robbers.  Baldwin is especially good in his role as Leon, a somewhat nebbish, but at the same time, innocently youthful killer.  It's a good performance from the Baldwin brother.  Rourke, as always, knows how to play sleaze.  His Rusty/Florence (great name, huh) is cold, deceitful and manipulative.  TWIN PEAKS' Sheryl Lee is both downhome homely but covertly sensual in her role as the kidnapped bank teller or loan officer.  There's more than meets the eye,however, with this one.  Country crooner Sammy Kershaw also shows up for a brief performance as the deputy.Paul Warner's direction keeps the atmosphere tense, and with a disturbing sense of doom, which he maintains throughout the movie.  The home videos are particularly effective in establishing some of the characters and their motivations.I liked this film, and think it bears witness to see how some of the unknowns then have blossomed into their present day careers.",4,INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,1528,"['FALL', 'TIME', 'interesting', 'different', 'movie', 'times', 'implausible', 'infused', 'sense', 'loss', 'despair', 'three', 'boys', 'who', 'play', 'teenagers', 'do', 'commendable', 'job', 'Jason', 'London', 'educated', 'uppity-at-times', 'Tim', 'David', 'Arquette', 'prankster', 'charge', 'David', 'Jonah', 'Bleckman', 'put-upon', 'Joe', 'latest', 'prank', 'be', 'last', 'cross', 'paths', 'two', 'homosexual', 'bank', 'robbers', 'homosexual', 'theme', 'underplayed', 'much', 'innuendo', 'abounds', 'sincerity', 'relationship', 'believable', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'play', 'robbers', 'Baldwin', 'especially', 'good', 'role', 'Leon', 'somewhat', 'nebbish', 'same', 'time', 'innocently', 'youthful', 'killer', 'good', 'performance', 'Baldwin', 'brother', 'Rourke', 'always', 'how', 'play', 'sleaze', 'Rusty/Florence', 'great', 'name', 'huh', 'cold', 'deceitful', 'manipulative', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'downhome', 'homely', 'covertly', 'sensual', 'role', 'kidnapped', 'bank', 'teller', 'loan', 'officer', 'more', 'eye', 'however', 'one', 'Country', 'crooner', 'Sammy', 'Kershaw', 'also', 'up', 'brief', 'performance', 'deputy.Paul', 'Warner', 'direction', 'atmosphere', 'tense', 'disturbing', 'sense', 'doom', 'movie', 'home', 'videos', 'are', 'particularly', 'effective', 'establishing', 'characters', 'motivations.I', 'liked', 'film', 'think', 'witness', 'see', 'how', 'unknowns', 'then', 'have', 'blossomed', 'present', 'day', 'careers']",N/A

(David Arquette, Stephen Baldwin, Mickey Rourke, etc.) One wonders what they saw in potential for this script or why they made choices to be involved.This horribly misguided film centers around a juvenile prank gone awry that ends up involving two bank-robbers who freak and there is enough gratuitous violence and mindless killing (and torture) to last me for the rest of my life.  The film starts out terribly boring and gets more mindless and boring as it concludes, perhaps expecting the violence to make up for the total lack of story.This is a disaster not worth enduring.

Then, the friend is kidnapped by the robber's pal, played to the hilt by Mickey Rourke. Stephen Baldwin is bewildered by what happened and is holding the guys who threw him in the trunk of their car by accident hostage. I enjoyed this strange and very entertaining movie. Mickey Rourke is at his best as always. He never pulls his punches when he plays a bad guy. I ordered this movie from Amazon.com and was very pleased with the easy and fast service I received. I have found many movies like this one that I didn't know existed on their site. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Mickey Rourke fan or just enjoys being entertained.
