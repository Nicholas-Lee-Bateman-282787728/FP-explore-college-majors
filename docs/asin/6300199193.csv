206740,A1P959K7WNXNGF,6300199193,Bob Hoskins,"[6, 7]","Another reviewer mentioned similarities between the run up and US involvement in Vietnam and the run up and involvement in Iraq. I think he nailed it.The USA for some reason holds itself accountable to no one and, should it seek to go to war, it will create false truths to do so.The second Gulf of Tonkin incident which effectively got the USA into the war is commented on by Naval servicemen of the time. Their collective comment is one of fabrication. Washington pressured and pressured for a ""positive attack"" that they eventually got despite all the evidence to the contrary.Two lone voices from the Senate rang out in dissent of the ""Gulf of Tonkin resolution"" which basically gave the President (then Johnson) unrestrained power to wage war without a declaration of war.Further into the documentary we see a ""rally"" reminiscent of Nazi Germany taking place. Young boys marching with flags on poles, Steel helmeted soldiers and hateful rhetoric by politicians and high ranking Armed forces officials that make your soul quiver.The arrogance of these people as they talk about ""dead China men, Asians etc"" as being animals and not caring about life makes you angry and just shocked at the zero value placed on the Vietnamese by the Americans.For 1968 this documentary dares to go against the popular support for the war by explaining the history of Vietnam and the descent by USA into a war that could never be won.It's fascinating, sad, emotional and you are left with a ""Wow, I'm almost ashamed to be part of this"" feeling.Iraq is today's Vietnam without the coverage. A needless waste of life in a war where neither the Vietnamese nor the Iraqi's ever threatened the United States.This documentary for me, is a study in ""The arrogance of Power"".",5,Riveting account of USA's arrogance,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,1753,"['reviewer', 'mentioned', 'similarities', 'run', 'up', 'US', 'involvement', 'Vietnam', 'run', 'up', 'involvement', 'Iraq', 'think', 'nailed', 'it.The', 'USA', 'reason', 'accountable', 'one', 'should', 'seek', 'go', 'war', 'will', 'create', 'false', 'truths', 'do', 'so.The', 'second', 'Gulf', 'Tonkin', 'incident', 'effectively', 'got', 'USA', 'war', 'commented', 'Naval', 'servicemen', 'time', 'collective', 'comment', 'one', 'fabrication', 'Washington', 'pressured', 'pressured', 'positive', 'attack', 'eventually', 'got', 'evidence', 'contrary.Two', 'lone', 'voices', 'Senate', 'rang', 'out', 'dissent', 'Gulf', 'Tonkin', 'resolution', 'basically', 'gave', 'President', 'then', 'Johnson', 'unrestrained', 'power', 'wage', 'war', 'declaration', 'war.Further', 'documentary', 'see', 'rally', 'reminiscent', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'taking', 'place', 'Young', 'marching', 'flags', 'poles', 'Steel', 'helmeted', 'soldiers', 'hateful', 'rhetoric', 'politicians', 'high', 'ranking', 'Armed', 'forces', 'officials', 'make', 'soul', 'quiver.The', 'arrogance', 'people', 'talk', 'dead', 'China', 'men', 'Asians', 'etc', 'being', 'animals', 'not', 'caring', 'life', 'angry', 'just', 'shocked', 'zero', 'value', 'placed', 'Vietnamese', 'Americans.For', '1968', 'documentary', 'dares', 'go', 'popular', 'support', 'war', 'explaining', 'history', 'Vietnam', 'descent', 'USA', 'war', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'won.It', 'fascinating', 'sad', 'emotional', 'are', 'left', 'Wow', ""'m"", 'almost', 'ashamed', 'be', 'part', 'feeling.Iraq', 'today', 'Vietnam', 'coverage', 'needless', 'waste', 'life', 'war', 'where', 'Vietnamese', 'Iraqi', 'ever', 'threatened', 'United', 'States.This', 'documentary', 'study', 'arrogance', 'Power']",N/A

If you want a realistic appraisal of what actually happened in Vietnam...keep looking, the guy that produced this turkey is obviously of the opinion that Vietnam was all Americas fault and tries very hard, but fails to put forth the idea that the U.S. lost the war in Vietnam from a military standpoint.  Those who lived through it know better.No, we didn't occupy and hold Vietnam, but then that was never the stated goal of the war, the biggest failure in Vietnam on the part of the U.S. Military was the failure to make the South Viet military comprehend the fact that we weren't staying forever, if there was any massive failure on the part of the U.S. it was Johnson's hard headed idea that we could win a limited war.

This film helped change a nation without the benefit of the subsequently revealed Pentagon Papers or now known confirming documents.

Get a copy for your Viet Nam era collection and stack it with ""The Anderson Platoon"", ""Medium Cool"", ""Getting Straight"", ""Alice's Restaurant"", ""The Green Berets"", and others made during, not after, that conflict.I watched it again today - the anniversary of the reunification of Viet Nam -  with my two youngest sons who are interested in that war, having played virtual versions of it in their video worlds.Seems the conflicting ideologies were all given pretty fair treatment to me. See the internet movie data base (imdb) for the strange bedfellows cast of original characters, including General Curtis ""bomb them back into the stone age"" LeMay to Daniel ""Brother of Philip"" Berrigan.... Original and amazing combat footage supplied by North Viet Nam includes the 1954 fall of Dien Bien Phu. There is some horrifying footage of the self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc, and revealing, candid interviews with American enlisted and officers in the field.
