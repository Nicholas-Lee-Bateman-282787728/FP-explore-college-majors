In ""The Final Destination"" (in 3-D!), Death has its eyes fixed on a Nascar race, and when an assortment of spectators escape their fate, they find themselves receiving their comeuppance in the most grisly and brutal ways imaginable, of course.By now, the formula for these films has been worn down considerably, and unfortunately the fourth installment in this inventive franchise does little to push the envelope, save for some gory and outrageous deaths. Switching back toFinal Destination 2director David R. Ellis, it should come as no surprise that the film is yet another guilty-pleasure carnival of carnage. At this point, you know what to expect, and while the plot is skimpy at best, this sequel pulls no punches and, at the very least, doesn't make you feel like you wasted your time. What it lacks in good characters and original story, it makes up for in its money shots (a.k.a. the death scenes).The 3-D gimmick helps the film out a bit, but unfortunately it's not put to as good of use as it was in the ""My Bloody Valentine"" remake. You'll get giddy during the opening sequence (which is introduced brilliantly by pummeling you with Shinedown's hard-hitting hit, ""Devour"") and get slight satisfaction out of seeing a few less-than savory characters get what they deserve (it's all about that pool scene!).

However, this blu ray edition is SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!!!It appears that this movie was shot with the same 3D technology as that used for AVATAR. I don't know if this is true or not, but this movie simply pours out the best of 3D effects in every single bit! Almost every 5 min, something will pop out (truly, POP OUT!) of the screen, to satisfy your 3D cravings. In the scenes without 'pop-out' effects, the 3d is still brilliant. You can sense great depth in the frame. Try the opening scene in the stadium. You will literally feel the height, depth and layers of the stadium seats. The blu ray video quality is outstanding with breathtaking clarity and sharpness. Color saturation, contrast and overall quality of the HD transfer is nothing but best in every single scene.Having owned many blu ray 3Ds, I can definitlety say that this blu ray 3D is THE Demo disc for your 3dtv system! This is almost equivalent to the Disney PIXAR Toy story 3 3D in terms of Full HD 3D presentation. Yeah, there is gore (and a lot of it), but if you are trying to see the limits of your 3D system, stop here. The audio is mind blowing, that can put you right in the middle of the scene. Simply brilliant by all means!This disc includes the 2D version of the movie too, and for those who are wondering, this newer version of the blu ray is designed for today's 3D TVs. This blu ray does not have the red-blu 3D glasses. You can use it with your active (shutter) glasses (for those who have either Samsung or Sony). For one disc, the price is bit high (considering that you can get Disney's 4 disc sets in the same price range), but the 3D HD quality compensates for it.",5,Review strictly about the 3D blu ray version: This movie is the pinnacle of 3D presentation,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1846,"['review', 'confined', 'mainly', '3D', 'effects', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'not', 'movie', 'itself.Yes', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'many', 'people', 'due', 'gory', 'bloody', 'disgusting', 'nature', 'However', 'blu', 'ray', 'edition', 'SIMPLY', 'OUTSTANDING', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'same', '3D', 'technology', 'used', 'AVATAR', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'true', 'not', 'movie', 'simply', 'out', 'best', '3D', 'effects', 'single', 'bit', 'Almost', '5', 'min', 'something', 'will', 'pop', 'out', 'truly', 'POP', 'OUT', 'screen', 'satisfy', '3D', 'cravings', 'scenes', ""'pop-out"", 'effects', '3d', 'still', 'brilliant', 'can', 'sense', 'great', 'depth', 'frame', 'Try', 'opening', 'scene', 'stadium', 'will', 'literally', 'feel', 'height', 'depth', 'layers', 'stadium', 'seats', 'blu', 'ray', 'video', 'quality', 'outstanding', 'breathtaking', 'clarity', 'sharpness', 'Color', 'saturation', 'contrast', 'overall', 'quality', 'HD', 'transfer', 'nothing', 'best', 'single', 'scene.Having', 'owned', 'many', 'blu', 'ray', '3Ds', 'can', 'definitlety', 'say', 'blu', 'ray', '3D', 'THE', 'Demo', 'disc', '3dtv', 'system', 'almost', 'equivalent', 'Disney', 'PIXAR', 'Toy', 'story', '3', '3D', 'terms', 'Full', 'HD', '3D', 'presentation', 'Yeah', 'gore', 'lot', 'are', 'trying', 'see', 'limits', '3D', 'system', 'stop', 'here', 'audio', 'mind', 'blowing', 'can', 'put', 'right', 'middle', 'scene', 'Simply', 'brilliant', 'means', 'disc', '2D', 'version', 'movie', 'too', 'who', 'are', 'wondering', 'newer', 'version', 'blu', 'ray', 'designed', 'today', '3D', 'TVs', 'blu', 'ray', 'not', 'have', 'red-blu', '3D', 'glasses', 'can', 'use', 'active', 'shutter', 'glasses', 'who', 'have', 'Samsung', 'Sony', 'one', 'disc', 'price', 'bit', 'high', 'considering', 'can', 'get', 'Disney', '4', 'disc', 'sets', 'same', 'price', 'range', '3D', 'HD', 'quality', 'compensates']",The Final Destination

Like,  the writter were getting tired of the same old and just wanted to get this over with. the FX were a little better in past 'episodes' of the blood fest and so in this one, made those 'suppose to be thrilling' moments a disappointment. like when the chick was in the car wash...NO!! you dont 'rescue' a girl that is about to be decapitated..[or so we thought] just before you think her head is gunna fly off and onto the floor...she's rescued...kind of like a pre-mature (you know!! :P) The elevator seen was to 'cut up' and the sequence wasnt quite right...made you sick that they blundered yet another juicy scene.

1195851,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001GCUO4S,B. E Jackson,"[11, 13]","You know, I tend to find the Final Destination series to be among the SCARIEST of all the horror films out there.  This is because the actual horror comes in the way of REAL possibilities.Alright, so they are real possibilities *greatly* exaggerated for the sake of creating a quality horror film, but when you stop and really think about it, the Final Destination series could really mess with your head, and perhaps even permanently screw up your mental state.That is, if you choose to take it seriously and believe in this kind of stuff.  You know, believing the death of every single person on the face of the planet is meant to happen for a reason, and we're all just ticking clocks waiting to die.  For someone like me, it's hard *not* to take a film like this somewhat seriously.  Death is just unbelievably fascinating to me, and this interpretation of it makes it even more exciting.After all, the way people die in this film involve cars, fires, heavy objects falling on top of people and crushing them, and several other realistic possibilities.  It's hard for me NOT to think some of this stuff is actually entirely likely to happen.Of course, the odds of a domino effect coming together and forming the perfect strategy to eliminate a human being is EXTREMELY unlikely to actually happen, but well... sometimes in real life, only a couple things have to come together in order to take out a person.  With *this* in mind, now you know why I find this series a bit freakier than other horror films.  It's exaggerated, but not entirely out of the realm of possibility.The movie writers who come up with the storylines for these kind of films must be exceptionally smart and clever.  They must sit there and actually think up the most bizarre and creative ways that a person can die.  Like I said above- these creative and incredibly graphic deaths are highly unlikely to happen in reality, but the fact so much attention to detail was given makes me really think the movie writers have a special talent for these specific kind of horror films.Anyway, another aspect of the Final Destination series that gives me a distinctly cold chill is whenever a death is about to happen, and you see a black shadow forming around the area or object that will eventually play a major role in killing a person.  It happens very briefly before the shadow fades away (along with a creepy sound effect to indicate it's there) but it's a special attention to detail that I REALLY like.  Good job to the movie writers for including it.  It actually makes me wonder if similar kinds of shadows can be seen in real life as a warning sign right before someone dies.  You never know.Anyway, what makes THIS Final Destination even better than previous ones is the fact that there's a *lot* of death scenes this time around.  Not only that, but the death scenes you witness this time around are EXTREMELY graphic, bloody and disgusting.  I sure hope you have a strong enough stomach to handle it!  They lay it on really thick and heavy for this one.Overall, yes.  Death is freaky.  Believing everything happens for a reason and certain people are meant to die is a *very* dangerous line of thinking (believe me, I've thought about it hard and heavy for several years now, and it's NOT healthy).  But do yourself a favor and check out a really superb way to handle the horror genre in the Final Destination series.  It's mind-bogglingly creative and just terrific.",5,out with a bang,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,3448,"['know', 'tend', 'find', 'Final', 'Destination', 'series', 'be', 'SCARIEST', 'horror', 'out', 'there', 'actual', 'horror', 'way', 'REAL', 'possibilities.Alright', 'are', 'real', 'possibilities', '*greatly*', 'exaggerated', 'sake', 'creating', 'quality', 'horror', 'film', 'when', 'stop', 'really', 'think', 'Final', 'Destination', 'series', 'could', 'really', 'mess', 'head', 'perhaps', 'even', 'permanently', 'screw', 'up', 'mental', 'state.That', 'choose', 'take', 'seriously', 'believe', 'kind', 'stuff', 'know', 'believing', 'death', 'single', 'person', 'face', 'planet', 'meant', 'happen', 'reason', ""'re"", 'just', 'ticking', 'clocks', 'waiting', 'die', 'someone', 'hard', '*not*', 'take', 'film', 'somewhat', 'seriously', 'Death', 'just', 'unbelievably', 'fascinating', 'interpretation', 'even', 'more', 'exciting.After', 'way', 'people', 'die', 'film', 'involve', 'cars', 'fires', 'heavy', 'objects', 'falling', 'top', 'people', 'crushing', 'several', 'other', 'realistic', 'possibilities', 'hard', 'NOT', 'think', 'stuff', 'actually', 'entirely', 'likely', 'happen.Of', 'course', 'odds', 'domino', 'effect', 'coming', 'together', 'forming', 'perfect', 'strategy', 'eliminate', 'human', 'being', 'EXTREMELY', 'unlikely', 'actually', 'happen', 'well', 'sometimes', 'real', 'life', 'only', 'couple', 'things', 'have', 'come', 'together', 'order', 'take', 'out', 'person', '*this*', 'mind', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'find', 'series', 'bit', 'freakier', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'exaggerated', 'not', 'entirely', 'realm', 'possibility.The', 'movie', 'writers', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'storylines', 'kind', 'films', 'must', 'be', 'exceptionally', 'smart', 'clever', 'must', 'sit', 'actually', 'think', 'up', 'most', 'bizarre', 'creative', 'ways', 'person', 'can', 'die', 'said', 'above-', 'creative', 'incredibly', 'graphic', 'deaths', 'are', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'happen', 'reality', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'given', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'writers', 'have', 'special', 'talent', 'specific', 'kind', 'horror', 'films.Anyway', 'aspect', 'Final', 'Destination', 'series', 'distinctly', 'cold', 'chill', 'whenever', 'death', 'happen', 'see', 'black', 'shadow', 'forming', 'area', 'object', 'will', 'eventually', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'killing', 'person', 'very', 'briefly', 'shadow', 'away', 'creepy', 'sound', 'effect', 'indicate', 'there', 'special', 'attention', 'detail', 'REALLY', 'Good', 'job', 'movie', 'writers', 'including', 'actually', 'wonder', 'similar', 'kinds', 'shadows', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'real', 'life', 'warning', 'sign', 'right', 'someone', 'dies', 'never', 'know.Anyway', 'what', 'THIS', 'Final', 'Destination', 'even', 'better', 'previous', 'ones', 'fact', '*lot*', 'death', 'scenes', 'time', 'around', 'Not', 'only', 'death', 'scenes', 'witness', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'EXTREMELY', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'disgusting', 'sure', 'hope', 'have', 'strong', 'enough', 'stomach', 'handle', 'lay', 'really', 'thick', 'heavy', 'one.Overall', 'yes', 'Death', 'freaky', 'Believing', 'everything', 'happens', 'reason', 'certain', 'people', 'are', 'meant', 'die', '*very*', 'dangerous', 'line', 'thinking', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'hard', 'heavy', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'NOT', 'healthy', 'do', 'favor', 'check', 'out', 'really', 'superb', 'way', 'handle', 'horror', 'genre', 'Final', 'Destination', 'series', 'mind-bogglingly', 'creative', 'just', 'terrific']",The Final Destination

The last ""movie"" I saw that was this bad was ""Ruins"" (and I didn't think it was humanly possible to make anything worse than that). Well. . .I was wrong.As I've seen most of the movies currently playing, my choices were very limited. So. . .after reading the blurb in front of the theater (which was the same mistake I made with Ruins), I decided to try Final Destination (and, sadly, they also didn't have a poster displayed - now I know why). There was so much blood and gore during the first five minutes, along with some of the most asinine and insipid dialog imaginable, that one has to question what type of morons would actually create such nonsense, as well as the intelligence of anyone who would pay money (let alone sit through the entire ""movie"") to see this. Normally, I don't give away the plot but Final Destination obviously doesn't have one. Of course, if you are so feeble-minded that you are entertained by human bodies being mutilated, in every possible conceivable (and non-conceivable) manner, have aspirations of becoming a serial killer, or have never had a brainwave in your life, this movie is certainly for you. Oh, I forgot to mention the ""dialog"" (if that's what it was supposed to be) - stupid teenybopper/college age (but certainly not college bound) kids boozing it up at a demolition derby certainly didn't require a script writer. The racist comments about a Black security guard by some of the lowlife trailer-trash characters, (""There goes the neighborhood"") while another moron whistles Dixie was certainly insightful into the clear lack of intelligence of the movie's creators. Then, they added a little more ""fun"" - every trite and utterly insipid ""special effect"" was not only used to emphasize the dismemberment of countless cast members, but it seemed like there were at least twenty ""actors"" who were impaled with only God knows how many planks, stakes, or anything else that might be used, during the first few minutes.After seeing enough blood and guts plastered across the silver screen (there was enough blood to fill both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans) that I literally walked out as the opening title was being displayed. I immediately had my ticket refunded and saw another movie instead.Perhaps the most disturbing thing of all is that people not only spend money to produce fecal material such a ""Final Destination"" but that other people actually spend money to watch it. Of course, the movie was also shown in 3-D to assist ""audiences"" in enjoying the relentless splattering of body fluids - heck, it might be just about as much fun as going to a slaughter house or cutting off your own extremities with a dull knife.",1,Didn't even make it to the opening title before I walked out,1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,2742,"['do', ""n't"", 'review', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'last', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'Ruins', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'humanly', 'possible', 'make', 'anything', 'worse', 'Well', '.I', 'was', 'wrong.As', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'currently', 'playing', 'choices', 'were', 'very', 'limited', 'So', '.after', 'reading', 'blurb', 'front', 'theater', 'was', 'same', 'mistake', 'made', 'Ruins', 'decided', 'try', 'Final', 'Destination', 'sadly', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'poster', 'displayed', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'blood', 'gore', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'most', 'asinine', 'insipid', 'dialog', 'imaginable', 'one', 'question', 'what', 'type', 'morons', 'would', 'actually', 'create', 'such', 'nonsense', 'as', 'well', 'intelligence', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'pay', 'money', 'let', 'alone', 'sit', 'entire', 'movie', 'see', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'Final', 'Destination', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'course', 'are', 'so', 'feeble-minded', 'are', 'entertained', 'human', 'bodies', 'being', 'mutilated', 'possible', 'conceivable', 'non-conceivable', 'manner', 'have', 'aspirations', 'becoming', 'serial', 'killer', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'brainwave', 'life', 'movie', 'certainly', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'mention', 'dialog', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'stupid', 'teenybopper/college', 'age', 'certainly', 'not', 'college', 'bound', 'kids', 'boozing', 'up', 'demolition', 'derby', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'script', 'writer', 'racist', 'comments', 'Black', 'security', 'guard', 'lowlife', 'trailer-trash', 'characters', 'neighborhood', 'moron', 'Dixie', 'was', 'certainly', 'insightful', 'clear', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'movie', 'creators', 'Then', 'added', 'little', 'more', 'fun', 'trite', 'utterly', 'insipid', 'special', 'effect', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'used', 'emphasize', 'dismemberment', 'countless', 'cast', 'members', 'seemed', 'were', 'least', 'twenty', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'impaled', 'only', 'God', 'how', 'many', 'planks', 'stakes', 'anything', 'else', 'might', 'be', 'used', 'first', 'few', 'minutes.After', 'seeing', 'enough', 'blood', 'guts', 'plastered', 'silver', 'screen', 'was', 'enough', 'blood', 'fill', 'Atlantic', 'Pacific', 'Oceans', 'literally', 'walked', 'out', 'opening', 'title', 'was', 'being', 'displayed', 'immediately', 'had', 'ticket', 'refunded', 'saw', 'movie', 'most', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'people', 'not', 'only', 'spend', 'money', 'produce', 'fecal', 'material', 'Final', 'Destination', 'other', 'people', 'actually', 'spend', 'money', 'watch', 'course', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'shown', '3-D', 'assist', 'audiences', 'enjoying', 'relentless', 'splattering', 'body', 'fluids', 'heck', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'going', 'slaughter', 'house', 'cutting', 'off', 'own', 'extremities', 'dull', 'knife']",The Final Destination

The second was also an enjoyable film that in some ways exceeded the first. The third wasn't terrible and was still an okay film but showed  a downfall in the series. This fourth entry in the series is by far the worst. The other three's opening disaster scenes were anywhere from really good to decent, the one in here is just cheesy and lame. It involves a race car crash that leads to a stadium falling apart and crushing many of the people inside. This scene is poorly done with terrible cheaply done cgi special effects. This film also suffers from cheesy 3d gimmicks that might have had some affect if you saw it on the big screen but are otherwise annoying. The death scenes in this one aren't as good or original overall as the ones in previous films.

1195862,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001GCUO4S,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","I know why ""The Final Destination"" was released in 3-D. It's to distract you from the fact that you're being told the exact same story all over again, only with new characters and a plot stripped so bare that the word ""simple"" hardly begins to describe it. What started as a clever and frightening idea back in 2000 has grown tiresome and derivative, and while it isn't quite campy, it definitely takes itself less seriously. I think I heard more laughing in the audience with this film than I did watching ""The Ugly Truth."" Consider an early scene in which a couple of boys cover their ears to shut out loud racetrack noises; their mother provides them with tampons to use as earplugs. Another scene late in the film shows a man trying but failing to hang himself: ""I've been trying to kill myself all day!"" he whines, after which he goes through a list of other failed suicide attempts.Of course, the 3-D process itself is the majority of the problem. Apparently, death scenes are lot funnier when objects come directly at you. That definitely explains shots of a man's head getting impaled, a golf ball whizzing through a woman's eye socket, and a tire flying through the air before decapitating a young woman. Never mind the horror of it all; if you're in the right mood, you will be in for a good laugh.In ""The Final Destination,"" the fourth in the series, an equally hapless group of young people find themselves in a frantic struggle against Death. When attending a racecar event with his friends, the burdened Nick O'Bannon (Bobby Campo) suddenly and inexplicably has a premonition that a car accident will kill many people in the arena, himself included. Panicked, he causes a fuss and gets himself and his friends kicked out of the arena, along with a select group of people. Lo and behold, there's an accident, and many people are killed. That should be the end of it, but hold on--it now seems that Death is going through the accident survivors one by one and picking them off. Nick foresees every event, naturally, although he can't quite make out who the event is intended for. That changes when he remembers his initial vision; through a process too inconsequential to describe, he determines the order in which each survivor will die.It now becomes a matter of Nick breaking the chain and stopping Death in its tracks. But how? His supportive but rattled girlfriend, Lori (Shantel VanSanten) doesn't seem to know, and neither do his callous friend, Hunt (Nick Zano), and his skeptical girlfriend, Janet (Haley Webb). Maybe George Lanter, the race track security guard (Mykelti Williamson), will be able to help Nick figure something out. But they had better hurry; the list of survivors is dwindling fast, and Nick and his friends are next.Usually, I provide a plot description first and then get into the deeper aspects of the story, such as characterization and theme. In the case of ""The Final Destination,"" the plot is the extent of the film's depth. You want to know about Nick, Lori, Hunt, and Janet? Look no further than what I said in the previous two paragraphs. The actors in this movie weren't hired to play human beings; they were hired to mindlessly stand in a scene and wait for their cue to die a horrible death. Think of it in terms of Sid from the original ""Toy Story"": He saw toys not as prized possessions but as worthless objects, and he liked to destroy them just for the fun of it. Destruction, I admit, can be fun, especially in a horror film. But when all you have at your disposal are drones that have absolutely no life to them, there's no sense of fun or entertainment. There's only a sense of emptiness.That being said, I realize I haven't said much about the 3-D process. I'll say this much: It achieves what it set out to achieve. This is especially true of the opening and closing credit sequences, which feature animated x-ray images of people being killed in all sorts of nasty ways. Bones break. Teeth shatter and fly right at you. Skullcaps get sliced off. A drill bit seems to be aimed right at our heads. Does this sound appealing to you? If so, fine. If not, be aware that it's probably the best the movie has to offer in the way of cool graphic imagery. Not even a carwash mishap or a movie theater explosion, both effective, have the same power and punch. And shots of Death manipulating objects to cause a disaster stopped being clever a long time ago.Why are they making more of these movies? Didn't the first one say everything that needed to be said? The insinuation is that ""The Final Destination"" is the last in the series, but I've repeatedly observed that the word ""final"" is meaningless when it comes to a popular horror franchise (""Friday the 13th"" used it twice, and they were proven wrong both times). If the 3-D process is the only way left to make this idea fresh and exciting, if the purpose is no longer to be scary but to film a series of gory death scenes, if the actors are given roles with no depth, then it's probably time to let go and move on to something else. Even Death needs a break from time to time.",2,"O Death, Where is Thy Entertainment?",1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,5084,"['know', 'why', 'Final', 'Destination', 'was', 'released', '3-D', 'distract',

1195863,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B001GCUO4S,Christopher Engel,"[0, 1]","The Final Destination series is really only about one simple formula: Guy/Girl has a premonition of a disaster, gets a bunch of his friends and some other people to safety, then the disaster happens and everyone dies except them. Cue Death, who steps in to finish the job, since those people were supposed to die then and didn't, and Death does not like that one bit. Death then goes around one-by-one and sets up catastrophic and hidden ""accidents"" for each person that survived.Death is clearly a sadist, since he could just, like, give them an aneurism or something, but instead he tries much more painful and sadistic methods to get his work done. So here we are, at the fourth movie, after three films of a whole lot of teenagers dying in freak accidents. For those who want more, here you go.Really, this one isn't exactly terrible and the death scenes do show a little originality, but the previous three really get the job done much better. Death #1, which, if I remember correctly, involves a tow truck and someone being set on fire, isn't all that great. There's very little suspense, as it all happens very quickly, and you never get that suspense you really want from the scenes in which you know someone's going to bite it somehow. The first death scene is a little over the top, and isn't constructed with much suspense. He's there, then he dies with a little help from Death, but not a lot. There's nothing special about the character himself, and the death is over quickly and isn't all that exciting.The second one is a bit of a curveball, since the whole time you're expecting something else to kill the character, but then she randomly dies from something completely different. That ""something"" happens to be a goddamned stone, but whatever. It's not very good, particularly since the character in question dies immediately and without knowing what hit her. It kind of leaves you disappointed at how little the scene really adds up to.Number three is probably the weakest in the whole series. It doesn't work on any level at all. I can stand a lack of realism for stuff like this, but only to a point, since it's pretty hard to die from being in a damned swimming pool. Somehow, the pressure when draining the pool is on the level of a singularity, and causes the character's intestines to be ripped from his...uh...underside. It's really stupid, honestly, and a total throwaway.Then we've got the rest of them. Again, nothing special for any of them. Often, like the others, they're over far too quickly, with no room for suspense, and it's pretty clear they went for quantity over quality here. There are more deaths here than any other FD film, but they're also far shorter and less carefully constructed. One after another, they inevitably go down, until the final climax when the day is supposedly saved (everyone knows by now it never is and Death doesn't just give up because you're determined enough to avoid it--even Clear Rivers learned that the hard way, and she was voluntarily placed in a padded cell to keep herself safe, and she still ended up dying early), and then the remaining characters all die in a spectacular fashion. Really, the climax of this movie is the best part. It's big, explosive, violent, and exciting. It loses a few points for avoidably poor realism (one does not bleed out their mouth from having their foot crushed), but at least it's hectic, and then the ending was supposed to conclude the series...until they made a fifth one. But it still works.This is probably the worst FD movie thanks to too many deaths with too little suspense involved in them. I've heard some people complain about the opening disaster, but I didn't have a problem with it, I just had a problem with everything after it.So, let's check off the things that really matter to the majority of us!Level of gore: 7/10. The stuff that's implied to be extra horrific is censored, but it's still bloody and gory. It gets the job done well enough.Creativity in kills: 3/10. No good. Very little suspense, and it's nothing all that exciting. It gets a couple points for the kills at the very end with the main characters, which was nicely done...they die twice.Character variety: 1/10. Yuck. Cardboard cutout stereotypes all around, with not one single person we should care about. Kind of a shame, really, considering the previous FDs had characters we gave a damn about. There isn't a single one here that is worth noting, though, including our main character, who is just a kid with no discernible traits worth mentioning. He's a generic good guy who has the premonition, and that's about all we care about from then on.Overall satsisfaction: 6/10. Again, it's not awful, and at least the kills are gory, but the suspense is seriously missing. Final Destination 2 this certainly isn't. Some say FD 3 was the worst one, but I have to disagree. This one shows even less creativity.Other problems: Sorry kids, no Tony Todd this time around. A real shame, since he's a staple of FD, and the one single recurring character up to this point. Even the one person who survives into the second film, Clear Rivers, ended up biting it in that one, to some people's dismay, as they wanted her to be a recurring character, too. I mean, if anyone could survive, she could...but no one can survive, so that's sort of a moot point. She went up against Death itself, for Christ's sake. How did she expect to win? But yeah, no Tony Todd.

First off, the &#34;U.S' in this movie is actually Florida (thus so fitting for racing) as opposed to Vancover-ized version of the U.S.as in the other 4 movies. You have absolutely no connection with any of the characters, either because they just are all awful at their craft, or just because you have no empathy for them (the 4 leads are just stiff in their roles).The story is too convoluted in that it does not follow the structure of how premonitions and death work as opposed to the other 4 installments. It is the one movie that is left out there on its own, with no point of reference to the original movie in any way shape or form (the other 3 touch on Flight 180, or have Tony Todd in them to remind us).I actually sat through this movie checking the remaining time left on my blu-ray player as to how much more of this I had to endure.DO NOT use this as a starting off point for the franchise as it will disappoint.

I bought it to add to my collection and expected to be on the edge of my seat like with all the others. I do like the storyline as having it all start at the raceway but there seemed to be a lack of characters and the characters that were portrayed weren't the brightest in trying to survive.I don't know if it was because they really didn't care if they lived or died or if they just weren't smart enough to do their research on past similar events. I was a bit confused because the other 3 movies were related.Every part after part one mentions what happened in the part before and how it effects the new characters.I was also wondering what happened to the surviving cop and girl from part 2.

Indistinguishable from its predecessors except for its premise, which begins at a race track. There, a group of obnoxiously moronic, attractive, foul-mouthed college kids are the focus of a catastrophe about to happen. One of the boys has a premonition of a disaster, which begins as a multi-car mashup culminating with vehicles and various auto parts and even the stadium itself becoming shrapnel missiles attacking spectators.In a blink, everything's back to normal the way it was just prior to the accident. It was a vision but suddenly everything in the vision prior to the disaster is identical. From here, the film becomes a menagerie of how creative can we see someone die. And the basic question is this: do we control our fate, or does fate control us? Also, what happens if we thwart fate by intervening and saving a life? The answer in these films seems to be: fate gets really pissed! I've found these films to be a good mindless excursion, actually funnier than films that are made to be so.

Technically it's a well executed Blu-ray and for that I'd give it five stars.This was touted as the *last* ""Final Destination"" (aka FD4) but that means nothing for a film franchise that may still be profitable and so there's a FD5 following this one. It's plenty ""scary"" in terms of startling events. The concept, however, is growing stale with essentially the same plot: trying to determine the sequence in which people will die and outwit Death before it claims the last one or two survivors. Just change the circumstances of the original vision containing the mass casualty event, the names of the characters, and the manner of their horrific deaths. Watching these in sequence starts to get boring after FD2. By comparison, I've watched Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" and Sergio Leone's ""Fistful of Dollars"" back-to-back and not been bored by it (Leone cloned Yojimbo nearly scene by scene and was successfully sued). Nor have I been bored watching the ""Resident Evil"" series (there's at least a varying story line with continuity through them). Giving this three stars, not for technical aspects of the Blu-ray, but for the film itself.

After a while it became predictable.The ending however I did not see coming and thought it was a great twist.Will not give it away but suffice it to say you should never think for one minute that you are SAFE in a FD movie. Overall a good entry to the franchise a great opening sequence at a race track some good acting some horrible and a clever twist at the end I did not see coming.This is not by no means the BEST FD not by a long shot to me the 2nd one was the best so far.I have still not seen the recent one the 5th one in 3d so I can not make an opinion of that as of yet.,3,NOT the final destination .,1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,1577,"['saw', 'back', '2009', 'was', 'tense', 'fun', 'funny.I', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'few', 'things.The', 'ACTING', 'was', 'huge', 'letdown', 'sure', 'FD', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'known', 'high', 'caliber', 'acting', 'still', 'was', 'letdown.The', '2', 'girl', 'characters', 'were', 'extremely', 'grating', 'everytime', 'talked', 'horrible', 'actors', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'annoying.The', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'bland', 'not', 'interesting', 'say', 'least.The', 'stereotypical', 'jerk', 'guy', 'was', 'very', 'cute', 'someone', 'was', 'rooting', 'die', 'whole', 'time.Mikael', 'Williamson', 'think', 'name', 'anyways', 'was', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'former', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'family', 'due', 'accident.Was', 'not', 'pleased', 'what', 'happened', 'will', 'say.It', 'was', 'cruel', 'extremely', 'fast', 'just', 'plain', 'cold.The', 'deaths', 'ranged', 'meh', 'pretty', 'good', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'deaths', 'case', 'someone', 'still', 'not', 'seen', 'movie.The', '3d', 'was', 'awesome', 'most', 'part', 'while', 'got', 'boring', 'stuff', 'popping', 'out', 'few', 'minutes', 'while', 'became', 'predictable.The', 'ending', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'twist.Will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'say', 'should', 'never', 'think', 'one', 'minute', 'are', 'SAFE', 'FD', 'movie', 'Overall', 'good', 'entry', 'franchise', 'great', 'opening', 'sequence', 'race', 'track', 'good', 'acting', 'horrible', 'clever', 'twist', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming.This', 'not', 'BEST', 'FD', 'not', 'long', 'shot', '2nd', 'one', 'was', 'best', 'so', 'far.I', 'have', 'still', 'not', 'seen', 'recent', 'one', '5th', 'one', '3d', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'opinion', 'yet']",The Final Destination
1195896,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B001GCUO4S,Kevin F. Tasker,"[0, 2]","The Final Destination films have always been so-called 'guilty pleasures,' providing suspense and buckets of blood to iron-stomached movie-goers. As with most horror franchises, the first film was a pretty legitimate exercise in unsettling filmmaking (it didn't hurt that this reviewer watched the film in the middle of winter in a theater without heat), with a pretty unique premise and some rather solid acting from its essentially all-teen cast. The subsequent Destinations have been lackluster to say the least. Cut to nine years later and the arrival of far and away the worst film yet.The problems with The Final Destination are almost too numerous and staggering to be calculated in total, but sufficed to say the misleading title (there was at least one film after this), is the least of T.F.D.'s worries.Let's focus first on the apparent raison d'tre of these movies: gory killings of unsuspecting n'er-do-wells by unknown supernatural forces. In T.F.D., these killings all feel cheap, random and poorly constructed. People are crushed by falling objects (again) like a car engine, they are slowly burned alive, etc but the cartoony nature of the sequences is not even laughably bad, its just plain boring. I have never seen a movie with so much CGI blood, CGI weapons, CGI everything! And this is some of the ABSOLUTE WORST CGI OF ALL TIME. More than once I literally checked the box to make sure this movie wasn't made in 1996. A few of the effects are so agonizingly dumb-looking they make that CGI octopus in Deep Rising look like something out of Avatar (see the movie audience in the film attacked with nails in perhaps the worst meta-stab at a real audience since Funny Games or the second act of Rubber). Blerg. And lets not forget that all effects are in eye-popping 3D--which only makes them look washed out and sort of blue, doing nothing to enhance them, only cross the eyes and confuse the brain of the watcher.And then there is the cast. Bland, bland, bland. A few tan, dull misogynist guys (see the film's cringe-inducingly piggish sex scene) and a few vapid, uninteresting women who talk about men and clothes and that's about it. One understands of course that horror movies are not filled with Shakespearean-class characters, but holy hell are these kids vacuous, not even in the 'cool these dummies are going to die in crazy ways' vacuous. More like, 'the physical presence of these people is making my eyes and ears bleed profusely and please make them go away, I'll do anything' vacuous. And in case you're wondering, good old Tony Todd, spoiler, doesn't even show up to be cryptic and cruel as Death's personification.Finally the plot, which is not even worth discussing. Its true that if you've seen one F.D. movie you've seen them all. This one deals with a Nascar incident and the resulting fallout upon the repugnant, one-note survivors who don't really figure out what is going on until pretty late in the movie and then don't even really do a whole lot to stop it. Moreover, the ending is virtually identical to that of the first film except for an asinine credit sequence showing--get this--the skeletons of the people as they are killed in slow-motion with spurts of way-fake blood. Woah! Dear T.F.D., Romeo Must Die called, and wants its crappy effect back.At least the movie is mercifully short. It clocks in at 82 minutes. Subtracting the credit sequences, it is probably just a hair over 70. That is of course the length of a standard TV drama, which is where this film should have gone. Or really, it shouldn't have been made at all. I won't dwell on that argument because there is apparently no stopping the Hollywood horror greed machine. Like a blood-thirsty escalator, it continues ratcheting on, searching for the next hapless teen-idol-wanabee too stupid to realize he/she is being tugged toward an early 'career' slaughter.",1,Garbage,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,3874,"['Final', 'Destination', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'so-called', ""'guilty"", 'pleasures', 'providing', 'suspense', 'buckets', 'blood', 'iron-stomached', 'movie-goers', 'most', 'horror', 'franchises', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'legitimate', 'exercise', 'unsettling', 'filmmaking', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'reviewer', 'watched', 'film', 'middle', 'winter', 'theater', 'heat', 'pretty', 'unique', 'premise', 'rather', 'solid', 'acting', 'essentially', 'all-teen', 'cast', 'subsequent', 'Destinations', 'have', 'been', 'lackluster', 'say', 'least', 'Cut', 'nine', 'years', 'later', 'arrival', 'far', 'away', 'worst', 'film', 'yet.The', 'problems', 'Final', 'Destination', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'numerous', 'staggering', 'be', 'calculated', 'total', 'sufficed', 'say', 'misleading', 'title', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'film', 'least', 'T.F.D', 'worries.Let', 'focus', 'first', 'apparent', 'raison', ""d'tre"", 'movies', 'gory', 'killings', 'unsuspecting', ""n'er-do-wells"", 'unknown', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'T.F.D.', 'killings', 'feel', 'cheap', 'random', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'People', 'are', 'crushed', 'falling', 'objects', 'again', 'car', 'engine', 'are', 'slowly', 'burned', 'alive', 'etc', 'cartoony', 'nature', 'sequences', 'not', 'even', 'laughably', 'bad', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'CGI', 'blood', 'CGI', 'weapons', 'CGI', 'everything', 'ABSOLUTE', 'WORST', 'CGI', 'ALL', 'TIME', 'More', 'once', 'literally', 'checked', 'box', 'make', 'sure', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', '1996', 'few', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'agonizingly', 'dumb-looking', 'make', 'CGI', 'octopus', 'Deep', 'Rising', 'look', 'something', 'Avatar', 'see', 'movie', 'audience', 'film', 'attacked', 'nails', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'meta-stab', 'real', 'audience', 'Funny', 'Games', 'second', 'act', 'Rubber', 'Blerg', 'not', 'forget', 'effects', 'are', 'eye-popping', '3D', 'only', 'look', 'washed', 'out', 'sort', 'blue', 'doing', 'nothing', 'enhance', 'only', 'eyes', 'confuse', 'brain', 'watcher.And', 'then', 'cast', 'Bland', 'bland', 'bland', 'few', 'tan', 'dull', 'misogynist', 'guys', 'see', 'film', 'cringe-inducingly', 'piggish', 'sex', 'scene', 'few', 'vapid', 'uninteresting', 'women', 'who', 'talk', 'men', 'clothes', 'One', 'course', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'filled', 'Shakespearean-class', 'characters', 'holy', 'hell', 'are', 'kids', 'vacuous', 'not', 'even', ""'cool"", 'dummies', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'crazy', 'ways', 'vacuous', 'More', ""'the"", 'physical', 'presence', 'people', 'making', 'eyes', 'ears', 'bleed', 'profusely', 'please', 'make', 'go', 'away', ""'ll"", 'do', 'anything', 'vacuous', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'good', 'old', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'spoiler', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', 'be', 'cryptic', 'cruel', 'Death', 'personification.Finally', 'plot', 'not', 'even', 'worth', 'discussing', 'true', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'F.D', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'Nascar', 'incident', 'resulting', 'fallout', 'repugnant', 'one-note', 'survivors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'pretty', 'late', 'movie', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'stop', 'Moreover', 'ending', 'virtually', 'identical', 'first', 'film', 'asinine', 'credit', 'sequence', 'showing', 'get', 'skeletons', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'slow-motion', 'spurts', 'way-fake', 'blood', 'Woah', 'Dear', 'T.F.D.', 'Romeo', 'Must', 'Die', 'called', 'crappy', 'effect', 'back.At', 'least', 'movie', 'mercifully', 'short', '82', 'minutes', 'Subtracting', 'credit', 'sequences', 'probably', 'just', 'hair', '70', 'course', 'length', 'standard', 'TV', 'drama', 'where', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'argument', 'apparently', 'stopping', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'greed', 'machine', 'blood-thirsty', 'escalator', 'ratcheting', 'searching', 'next', 'hapless', 'teen-idol-wanabee', 'too', 'stupid', 'realize', 'he/she', 'being', 'tugged', 'early', ""'career"", 'slaughter']",The Final Destination

The musical score by Brian Tyler was fun and complemented the montage of CGI visuals peppered throughout the piece.  The actor portraying the security guard was great, and the teen cast, although expendable, kept things interesting.  It was very tongue-in-cheek--the filmmakers are probably surprised by the popularity of the theme and are trying to push it to new limits.

I liked 1 and 2, 3 was ok at best, and 4 was unwatchable.The first thing that struck me was the bizarre choice of cast. One of the main characters seemed to be a half-hearted attempt to create a comic relief. Its like putting an American Pie character into a horror film, just doesn't work. And the acting in general is horrible compared to previous films. It was horrible compared to any film really......Second thing I noticed is that the beginning (as well as most of the movie) was pretty lame. I know this is personal opinion, but a race track in the middle of the day?This brings be to my third gripe. Its obvious a race track was chosen so they could take advantage of the then newer 3d effects. When watching the movie in 2d, it was very evident the parts that were meant for 3d. These parts looked cheesy and out of place in the 2d version.While previous movies relied on creative untimely (albeit) cheesy deaths, this one relied on... well... 3d effects. The deaths were uncreative and liked to exemplify tons of explosions.Unfortunately one weakness in the whole series is plot holes. This time the main character has dreams that give him hints. Also, he has more than one ""premonition."" This really doesnt do something except take up extra time and give the movie the ability to show of the same explosion several times..... Seriously, they had to be running out of ideas.In conclusion, this movie seemed to have been made to appeal to the rise of 3d technology in movies.

After all, it was a clever idea: who can be a stronger vilain than Death itself?The previous three movies did never bother to even try to explain the following questions:a) Why the main character has/acquires the premonition power?b) Why Death goes through all the trouble to plan extremely intricate plots to get his victims after they survive its first plan?c) Why all the teen characters, when faced with such tremendous odds, appears to have no relatives, parents, friends, contacts, anyone who could help them?This fourth chapter bothers even less with answering those questions. Also, it's extremely more cruel than the others before: there's not even a hint of hope for the characters to survive (and they don't) And the cast sunk to a new low: performances were uniformly lousy, to a point that you simply don't care. You simply doesn't know nothing about them: if they are students, if they work, whatever.To make things worse, the writer planned a ""twist"": after all the struggle fighting Death's inegenious plans, the main characters figures that Death had planned for them to die that wat all along.

Then one by one, death catches up with them. However, the plot and finding outs in this one did not hold up as well as the first 2, or even the 3rd one for that matter. The storyline of this one goes very quickly. It doesn't seem to play on that cool idea that ""what you think is about to happen, happens, but after they do something not expected just before it"" this one is pretty much, you think you know whats about to happen, and it pretty much just does.There is a couple of cool death scenes in this one that should make fans of the film say ""HA, COOL!!!"" but then again there is also a few that really looked dodgy and too CGI.

Some deaths were so insane, like a guy being pulled through a overcharged pool drainer, a woman getting a motor on top of her, a man being hit into a fence and parts of him being cut in squares, etc. The ending with people seeing a 3-D movie brought self-awareness.What it does lack in further plotting, though the agressive vision style, and one character accepting death so he can see his wife and kids I thought worked well.Other parts were funny like a character being referred to as ""the racist"", the incompetence of the main character, one extremly stupid guy, and a lot more.Some people will hate this movie for what it represents in the franchise; a total exploitation of silliness and way too much fun that it can't possibly be enjoyable. But it is.I for one hope they make Final Destination 5 on a cruise ship, with death being a real thing. Keep the CGI but make it a lot darker and the franchise will keep going strong.

This film wasn't even that good.... it is basically the biggest money maker worldwide in the Final Destination Series yet it In my opinion and I am sure I am not alone that this is the worst Final Destination of the series... but it was much better than Halloween II and I only say that movie because they both came out on the same day!Plot: After a horrendous racing accident a group of survivors must fight death in an unoriginal and overdone story that lacks a lot of things..... Death after death the survivors soon realize that there is a pattern to the deaths according to where they were sitting the higher up you sat and survived the longer you would have to live!Review: Boo.... I expected more from David R. Elis. Especially after his impressive ""Snakes on a Plane"" and this years decent creature feature ""Shark Night 3D"". The deaths were cool but looked completely fake especially the CGI blood that looks like it was made by a 9th grader while he was goofing off on a computer in a study hale for an hour!!! There is very few decent quality from this movie... the acting was okay.... the soundtrack was cool, and the death scenes were actually I have to say that I was only impressed by the creativity of a few death scenes the rest were unoriginal and stupid!Acting: I only recognized Krista Allen (""Silent Venom"" and ""Feast"".) She is a decent actor and the rest were as well but none of them really stuck out above the rest!Gore: lots of fake blood and gore, people get crushed and burned several times, a rock has a rock blast through her eye, decapitations, and impalements, and lots more... I just wish it looked more real but I do believe this is the goriest/bloodiest out of them all!Bottom Line: I don't know about this movie.... it was pretty bad but I didn't absolutely hate it.... it was a little under decent all in all.... but it was too unoriginal and cheesy that deducted a point right there!Rated: ""R"" for strong violent/gruesome accidents, language and a scene of sexualityIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 4For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 2",2,Cheap thrills/gore with a Huge Budget!,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,2342,"['Budget', 'movie', 'was', '43', 'million', 'according', 'IMDB', 'International', 'movie', 'data', 'base', 'book', 'huge', 'R-Rated', 'movie', 'especially', 'horror', 'movie', 'what', 'most', 'made', '186', 'million', 'worldwide', 'how', 'possible', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'basically', 'biggest', 'money', 'maker', 'worldwide', 'Final', 'Destination', 'Series', 'yet', 'opinion', 'am', 'sure', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'worst', 'Final', 'Destination', 'series', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Halloween', 'II', 'only', 'say', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'day', 'Plot', 'horrendous', 'racing', 'accident', 'group', 'survivors', 'must', 'fight', 'death', 'unoriginal', 'overdone', 'story', 'lot', 'things', '..', 'Death', 'death', 'survivors', 'soon', 'realize', 'pattern', 'deaths', 'according', 'where', 'were', 'sitting', 'higher', 'sat', 'survived', 'longer', 'would', 'have', 'live', 'Review', 'Boo', 'expected', 'more', 'David', 'R.', 'Elis', 'Especially', 'impressive', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'years', 'decent', 'creature', 'feature', 'Shark', 'Night', '3D', 'deaths', 'were', 'cool', 'looked', 'completely', 'fake', 'especially', 'CGI', 'blood', 'was', 'made', '9th', 'grader', 'was', 'goofing', 'off', 'computer', 'study', 'hale', 'hour', 'very', 'few', 'decent', 'quality', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'cool', 'death', 'scenes', 'were', 'actually', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'only', 'impressed', 'creativity', 'few', 'death', 'scenes', 'rest', 'were', 'unoriginal', 'stupid', 'Acting', 'only', 'recognized', 'Krista', 'Allen', 'Silent', 'Venom', 'Feast', 'decent', 'actor', 'rest', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'none', 'really', 'stuck', 'out', 'rest', 'Gore', 'lots', 'fake', 'blood', 'gore', 'people', 'get', 'crushed', 'burned', 'several', 'times', 'rock', 'rock', 'blast', 'eye', 'decapitations', 'impalements', 'lots', 'more', 'just', 'wish', 'looked', 'more', 'real', 'do', 'believe', 'goriest/bloodiest', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'hate', 'was', 'little', 'decent', 'was', 'too', 'unoriginal', 'cheesy', 'deducted', 'point', 'right', 'there', 'Rated', 'R', 'strong', 'violent/gruesome', 'accidents', 'language', 'scene', 'sexualityIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '4For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '2']",The Final Destination

The storyline is the same; the plot is the same; the ""out-of-your-seat"" suspense is the same; but when you add 3D to the success of the three previous classics, this one is a total winner.  If, in fact, this destination is now final, I think a 4-movie marathon is in order...with the first three being upgraded to 3D!  If you have not been a stout follower of this series, the 3D version will totally blow you away (no pun intended).  Director David Ellis has shared directorship with James Wong since 2000, when the first (and best) film hit the screens.  Wong was the director of 1 and 3, Ellis of 2 and 4.  If asked which is the better director in this supporting role, I would have to stick with Wong.  There's nothing Wong with Wong...everything is right!While watching this film in the theatre this afternoon, a mom brought her younger children (I'm guessing 8 and 10 years old).  DON'T BRING THE KIDS!  This is much too intense for them...especially in 3D!!!  The kids kept asking their mom if they could leave...but she just told them to shut up and sit down.  Don't make that mistake.  This film will be highly traumatic to kids...and adults if they are not accustomed to a gruesome gorefest like this (and all 4 destinations).I give this final edition 5 stars because of the 3D element.

1195934,A39W3263A9HCMN,B001GCUO4S,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[2, 3]","Well guys, look at it this way. The Final Destination Series has now made its fame in the horror movie world: the gory accidental deaths, the premonitions leading up to each, the shattering conclusions. We get it... Final Destination. And if anything, this better be ""The Final Destination"". How many installments have we endured already? Oh right, 4. I forgot since we have had so many fly our way.I very well enjoyed the first movie. It was original, it had a cool concept that we hadn't seen before, good acting, some good gory deaths, and also some good aspiring actors that are still in movies today. The second one I enjoyed, but not as much, but I still enjoyed it. And hell, I'm man enough to even fess up to enjoying the third one, even though it was slightly retarded, but I still liked it- it had that kid from the opening scene of The Ring 2, it solidified my fear of roller coasters (I don't think I'll be going on The Mind Bender anymore or going tanning after seeing it), Had lots of gore, and that (choose their fate) thing was fun to play with.And then I saw this one. I missed its 3D theatrical release which is something I regretted. But recently tonight I sat down and watched it in 2D on Blu-Ray, and I guess I don't regret missing it in 3D. This movie is pretty much a confirmation that the series is pure straight dead in the water (no pun intended).The movie begins with the four principal characters: One's a guy named Nick that looks like my friend Nick, two are sexy chicks: Lori and Janet, and another guy, named Hunt, who has hair that is but a hint to how big of a douche bag he is. They are all gathered at the speedway for a bit of the ol' Speed racing... in a VERY OLD speedway. After smuggling Jack Daniels into binoculars (*makes JD smuggling plans for the coming U2 concert*... OK!!! I'm joking!!!! God, take a joke, will ya?), tampons as ear plugs, and an obnoxious racist redneck behind him, a car crash is caused by a flat tire, and the guy's car basically collapses on the speedway, and... well... its parts shoot out towards everyone! And furthermore... *dramatic music*... the speedway collapses!......oh, well, it was just a premonition. So like in the other movies, our heroine, Nick saves everyone... except one who escaped! Anyways, so after. Basically, there's a memorial at the speedway after it actually happens, and thus like in the other movies, a bunch if far-fetched deaths and other stuff happen, and Nick tries to ""rip up Death's list"", yada yada yada. And I don't need to summarize the rest because you hae seen the other three (or at least I hope you have), and so you basically know the turn of events.Now let's take a look at the movie in general. It's called ""THE"" Final Destination. The ""the"" is emphasized for a reason: it's THE Final Destination. Thankfully it is. At 80 minutes, this movie goes by fast. Thankfully it does- the movie is an 80 minute re-hashing of movies 1-3, but with more deaths and gore, more of everything basically. More nudity, more douche bags, more hot girls, more... need I continue?See the problem with this movie is that as virtually plot-free as it is, it's also criminally BORING. Maybe it's because of the nausem of the first three movies. But there's nothing new, nothing exciting here. This is basically just the entire series in autopilot mode- with nothing but more deaths and gore. You can basically say this movie is The PERIOD Final Destination, but then again you could say that for the others too. And Ellis tries to fill in the void with some CG, but even that fails, because it is virtually fake looking and cheap.Also, despite this movie being THE Final Destination, the ending leaves the gates open for a fifth movie. But why I would want to sit through a fifth installment after an arse-numbing 80 minutes of a fourth installment is beyond me. But then again, a completist, my inner hypocrite will see the fifth movie. Who am I to break up a series?So basically, by skipping this movie, you aren't missing anything. Just what you saw in movies 1-3 again, and what you will continue to see for years to come.IN TOTAL:Entertainment: 4/10- wasted potentialSex: 3/10, and NOT of the good kind (more like the douche bag kind)Violence: It's a FD movie, okay?/10Gore: I'm keeping my *eye* on you/10Jerk hair: 10/10Death by pool drains: Will have exhausted outdoor pools for months to comeCar Washes: Well, there's a new definition of ""suddy water""Seen it all before: 10/10Superfluous dreams: Holy crap!

Really it's just ""Final Destination"" 4, but they added a The in front of the title to set it apart from the original 3, for which the original 3 must be grateful. Actually they should have stopped at #2 with it's appocalyptic highway crash from hell(the first premonition) and the hilariously gruesome finale with a dismembered barbequed leg complete with tennis shoe landing on a family picnic table. Number 3 was ok with its rollercoaster disaster and there were some imaginative ""deaths""-the nail gun scene was perfectly timed for suspense.  The first movie was very good and while some may argue it was the best, I still prefer #2 as the best of the bunch.Now comes the latest in the franchise and ""The Final Destination"" fails on all counts-The characters and the actors playing them are boring-the ""deaths"" are surprisingly tame and even lame. The budget on this installment must have been pretty small because most of the gore is missing which is unusual since this series usually is pretty graphic with its guts and gore. Maybe most of the budget was consumed by the 3-D effects but you know they also squandered this too when the best 3-D effect is a popped champagne cork.

1195947,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B001GCUO4S,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","""The Final Destination"", released in some countries as ""Final Destination: Death Trip 3D"", continues the series with barely a reference to the previous 3 chapters, and with a fair degree less effectiveness.  It admittedly had a high bar to live up to though, and is still worth watching.In the Final Destination series, a number of catastrophes have been avoided by a character having a premonition which directly results in them, and a group of other people, avoiding that forseen fate.  Death then seems to come after them, though, as if it's deliberately trying to reclaim each person who survived because of that premonition.  In Parts 2 and 3, vague hints that could have been the beginning of links tying the separate incidents together were forming, but that's been dropped here and we get right to an all-new scenario and all-new characters.  In fact, one watching this movie without being aware of the others might hardly guess that this was actually the fouth and not the first entry.  Expecially since they dropped the ""Part 4"" and simply added ""The"" ahead of the title.  In any event, this chapter opens at a Nascar-type racetrack, where a multi-car crash-up spills into the stands and kills quite a few spectators.  It's reminiscent of the highway disaster in Part 2 but not as effective.  After the character of Nick (Bobby Campo) foresees these, he creates a commotion that gets himself, his friends, and a few nearby strangers thrown out of the stadium right before the explosive crash-up.  Shortly thereafter, death starts coming for the survivors.One weakness is with the way death comes this time.  In previous entries, the incidents were usually spectacular, and at the same time could have each, by themselves, been written off as once-in-a-lifetime freak accidents.  Only the way these freak accidents continue happening, targeting survivors, reveals that there's something far bigger and stranger than coincidence at work.  Here, the individual incidents (of what I think of as Death's ""Backlash"" effect) are not only a bit weak (for the most part) compared to the previous movies, they make less sense.  For example, some water spills on a countertop.  For some reason this causes a drink container to slowly slide across the counter until it hits a lever, which causes something to short out and kill somebody.  Now, there's a way to take this wonkiness in cause and effect as something that actually works, if they want to follow up on it in any future sequel.  Death could be getting stronger, perhaps Because of the whole premonition/backlash effect.  So say early on, it could take a one-in-a-milion probability and make it happen; now it can take something so far out that it wouldn't likely be seen as simple coincidence, more like a one-in-a-billion probability, and use that to its advantage.  Just a thought, because otherwise many of the deaths in here seem very contrived.Okay, there's the negatives.  Positives - not all of the death backlashes are that weak, and some - even allowing for far reduced cause-and-effect, do come off pretty impressive.  The production values are very high as is par for the course in Final Destination; the female cast members are gorgeous, as is par for the course; and at the very end the movie finally re-captures a sense of grandeur.  I can't really get into that without giving away the ending, but something about it struck me in a particular way that just adds to my thinking that they may be planning the introduction of some really new elements for the future.  That something bigger may be coming.The characters, admittedly, weren't as strong this time out.  The acting itself was fine, and I thought Mykelti Williamson (George) and Haley Webb (Janet) managed to milk the most out of their roles.Now onto the 3D.  I've seen both the 2D and 3D versions of the movie, although the 3D wasn't in a theater.  Actually, because the town I live in doesn't have RealD technology in its theater, I've yet to see the new wave of 3D and how impressive it's supposed to be (Note to self: this summer, get yer rump to the nearest city that Does have a 3D theater in time for Piranha 3D and/or Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D).  However, based on the home viewing experience, The Final Destination made possibly the best use of 3D I've yet seen, not in the stunts it went for but in the visual quality.  One home sets (I don't have a thousand dollar flatscreen but my set isn't a bottom-of-the-line piece of junk, either) the 3D is still impressive, but sometimes the picture's hazy or the color scheme takes a beating, tending toward black-and-white on certain, mainly a bit older, releases.  The 3D on The Final Destination was sharp, for the most part holding its color and its clarity.  The 3D improved on the 2D experience in another way.  Most of the Final Destination series has had very good special effects.  In this one, there are a few times where they don't look nearly as real, but these generally improve when watching in 3D compared to 2D.  Perhaps they were specificall designed for the 3D format and looked Really good on a RealD screen.  But there should be a way to keep them looking good in 2D as well.  None of the sequences were awful in 2D, just not always up to the standards of the series.In the end, this is still very much worth seeing.  It's behind the others in most ways, but judged on its on merits is still a very enjoyable movie.  And the Final Destination concept lends itself exceptionally well to the 3D format.  Note for connosseurs - the 3D hologram cover is pretty impressive itself.",3,"3.5 Stars - Least Of The Series, But Still Good;  3D Helps Somewhat",1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,5582,"['Final',

One of the things that came out as distinctive, or 'original', about it was the fact that death itself was chasing these characters who were meant to die but escaped.Now, ten years and 3 movies later, plotwise, there's absolutely nothing original about these movies. They've basically remade the original movie 3 times, and people keep coming to the theatres mainly to see how different the deaths are.Even the death scenes have gotten increasingly worse since FD2. FD2 was, yes, a ""remake"", but a worthy sequel nonetheless. The opening was absolutely fantastic, scary, crazy stuff. Made me terrified to go home by car. The deaths were a bit cartoonish but not cartoonish enough to make me laugh (FD3, FD4.)These movies are not (supposed to be) comedies. I guess that's the problem. There was a ominous, malevolent presence in FD and FD2 that I just wasn't able to see in FD3 and 4.I wish they came up with a ORIGINAL Final destination movie.

1195953,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B001GCUO4S,Tim Janson,"[0, 1]","Like ""Wash, rinse, repeat""...The Final Destination's refrain is laboriously repetitive.  The fourth film in the series offers nothing new over its predecessors other than the novelty of being in 3D.  Now sure, if there was ever a series perfectly suited for 3-D it's the Final Destination series with its in-your-face kills.  Unfortunately, 3-D on home TV pretty much sucks.  While technology has advances in theaters, home 3-D still has not managed to do any better than the same blue and red 3-D glasses that have been around for decades.  If you can sit through this and not develop a migraine from the glasses then you're a winner!This film begins as all the others, with one of the characters having a premonition of a terrible disaster.  This time it takes place at an auto race as Nick (Bobby Campo) has a vision of a crash which will spill into the stands killing dozens of spectators.  Nick gets his friends Lori, Hunt, and Janet out, as well as some nearby spectators just before the carnage unfolds.  And carnage it is with, among other kills, a woman who gets crushed by a car's engine.From there you know the story.  Death isn't about to let the group get away.  It's not long before each of the survivors of Nick's vision gets killed in one gruesome way after another as Nick tries to somehow break the chain and throw death off their track.  Like elaborately placed dominos, the death scenes unfold with chance circumstances leading to the big payoff.  But the entire film trudges from one death to the next.  The group sits around trying to figure out who is going to be next on the hit list, arriving just seconds too late to stop it, before the entire cycle starts over.  Even the Friday the 13th series managed to forward the character of Jason somewhat in each film.  Here there's not even the attempt to understand Death's...or Fate's motives.  The director merely wants to play with the 3-D which is lackluster at best.  Even the actors play their roles like soldiers doing the same drill for the hundredth time.As has been the case with the series, the opening mass-killing is the highlight of the film but this one has little to keep the viewer's interest beyond the first twenty minutes.  While there are some original and gory kills it seems we always get the ubiquitous character getting hit by speeding car/bus/truck, ambulance, etc...",2,We can only Hope this is the Final One,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,2363,"['Wash', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'Final', 'Destination', 'refrain', 'laboriously', 'repetitive', 'fourth', 'film', 'series', 'nothing', 'new', 'predecessors', 'other', 'novelty', 'being', '3D', 'Now', 'sure', 'was', 'ever', 'series', 'perfectly', 'suited', '3-D', 'Final', 'Destination', 'series', 'in-your-face', 'kills', 'Unfortunately', '3-D', 'home', 'TV', 'pretty', 'much', 'sucks', 'technology', 'advances', 'theaters', 'home', '3-D', 'still', 'not', 'managed', 'do', 'better', 'same', 'blue', 'red', '3-D', 'glasses', 'have', 'been', 'decades', 'can', 'sit', 'not', 'develop', 'migraine', 'glasses', 'then', ""'re"", 'winner', 'film', 'others', 'one', 'characters', 'having', 'premonition', 'terrible', 'disaster', 'time', 'place', 'auto', 'race', 'Nick', 'Bobby', 'Campo', 'vision', 'crash', 'will', 'spill', 'stands', 'killing', 'dozens', 'spectators', 'Nick', 'friends', 'Lori', 'Hunt', 'Janet', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'nearby', 'spectators', 'just', 'carnage', 'unfolds', 'carnage', 'other', 'kills', 'woman', 'who', 'crushed', 'car', 'engine.From', 'there', 'know', 'story', 'Death', ""n't"", 'about', 'let', 'group', 'get', 'away', 'not', 'long', 'survivors', 'Nick', 'vision', 'killed', 'one', 'gruesome', 'way', 'Nick', 'somehow', 'break', 'chain', 'throw', 'death', 'track', 'elaborately', 'placed', 'dominos', 'death', 'scenes', 'unfold', 'chance', 'circumstances', 'leading', 'big', 'payoff', 'entire', 'film', 'trudges', 'one', 'death', 'next', 'group', 'around', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'next', 'hit', 'list', 'arriving', 'just', 'seconds', 'too', 'late', 'stop', 'entire', 'cycle', 'Even', 'Friday', '13th', 'series', 'managed', 'forward', 'character', 'Jason', 'somewhat', 'film', 'Here', 'not', 'even', 'attempt', 'understand', 'Death', 'Fate', 'motives', 'director', 'merely', 'play', '3-D', 'lackluster', 'best', 'Even', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'soldiers', 'doing', 'same', 'drill', 'hundredth', 'time.As', 'been', 'case', 'series', 'opening', 'mass-killing', 'highlight', 'film', 'one', 'little', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interest', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'original', 'gory', 'kills', 'always', 'get', 'ubiquitous', 'character', 'getting', 'hit', 'speeding', 'car/bus/truck', 'ambulance', 'etc']",The Final Destination
1195954,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B001GCUO4S,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 0]","Final Destination 4: ""The Final Destination"" was not what I expected, I mean they had the 3D glasses which made things look like they were aimed at you and all but it wasn't anything new in the Final Destination Franchise. The first three films in the series had creative death sequences and great special effects, this one doesn't have death sequences that were that great but the special effects and 3D was something cool. The 3-D doesn't work with every movie but with Final Destination it works well and can make you jump from your seat, having things thrown at you is surprising and you sort of experience the deaths which was pretty cool. While the first three had good stories this one looks as if the writers didn't know what to do anymore, the story wasn't nearly as good and it was a little predictable.That said the only good thing about FD4 was truly the addition of 3D, the visual looks great and there's a good chance you will be scared while watching but 3D alone shouldn't BE the movie as it is here. The acting was mostly bad; I felt it was much better in the previous films, this time around you don't really feel anything for the characters. The deaths looked great but weren't anything new they were not really original for the most part. What helps it is the 3D otherwise it wouldn't even be worth watching. I liked the other FD films much better than this one which left me disappointed. It is said to be the final movie, the final destination as its title implies but can we really be sure about this?

1195956,A3SLPJHXZYTT8A,B001GCUO4S,Ton Thai,"[2, 2]","I would like to start off by saying I'm a fan of the FINAL DESTINATION series. Even the much maligned third film is starting to grow on me. When it was announced that David Ellis was returning to the director chair (along with screenwriter Eric Bress), I was quite excited, considering that part two is arguably the best in the series. But this one. If I were to describe this film in one word, I would say DISAPPOINTING. In fact, this is one of the most disappointing movies of this year! The fact that the makers of part two has returned just adds on to the frustration.The film starts off pretty rushed. In fact, the film is rushed altogether. You feel as if the filmmakers wanted to get through with the film. The laziness is so apparent in here that you're wondering how much the executives offered in their salary. The film is so lazy that there are even glaring plot holes in the hackneyed script! How the hell does a film that is based on something ridiculous have plot holes? The film--better yet, the franchise, spends most of its time in setting up rules on the order people are going to die yet this film ignores practically everything and kills people in any order it feels like!Even the clever foreshadowing from the previous films is quite blatant here. The laziness is also extended to the death scenes. Remember, quality, not quantity. Even though this film has the most death scenes compared to the previous entries, most of them suck and even that word wouldn't give the deaths that much justice. We all have to admit it sooner or later but we see these films for the death scenes. What is the freaking point in watching this film if they turn out to be lazy to an extent that some death scenes are rehashed from previous FD films? Exactly. There is no point.Another problem about the death scenes is that there is barely any suspense when people are about to get killed. Usually, in the FD films, seeing the set up of the Rube Goldberg-like death scenes IS the suspense, but in here, they feel as if they come out of nowhere because of how rushed everything is. They're surprising, yes, but the surprises wear off very quickly. Google up Alfred Hitchcock's definition of ""suspense"" to learn the difference between surprise and suspense.Let's move on to the next problem: CGI. With the 3D technology, it's obvious the filmmakers wanted to add more CGI effects so the images could pop out on the screen. The problem here is that the FINAL DESTINATION series is always known for their practical effects. The premonition sequence in here works well in 3D, sure, but the CGI is terrible! They look so fake that I questioned how this film wasn't released direct to DVD.You know you have a bad film when a franchise that was supposed to be scary and mysterious now turns into something that pokes fun of itself. It has happened many times before, most notably, the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise. It's as if the filmmakers were aware that the franchise is dying and that their last attempt was to add self-aware characters and idiotic, dumb lines in the film with the many problems the film already has.Even the characters are more like an excuse to kill them off later. It's apparent that this isn't a movie but more of a carnival ride, waiting to see who dies and how they will die. That's how low this film has gone. You'd also be surprised to find out that the most fleshed out character is, in fact, not the protagonist, but a supporting character, played by Mykelti Williamson. He gives a laughable and forced performance but that's nothing compared to Bobby Campo, who is easily the worst premonitionist in the franchise. He can't act to save his life. And the less we say about the others, the better. However, I'm willing to admit the only character I did feel sympathy for was played by Krista Allen, who plays a motherly role with an extremely short running time.However, there are other few things that I liked about the film (emphasis on the word ""few""): There's a sequence in a salon and a car wash that have at least SOME suspense. I don't know if this counts but I also liked the opening credits, which I thought was ingenious, a montage of the previous films' memorable death scenes. And that's about it. Three things. What an accomplishment!I guess it isn't hard to tell but this is, by far, the weakest in the series because there's nothing new. You'd expect that a mythology so easily expandable would be explored here but no. By the end of the film, you feel underwhelmed. You wished they could have done better. In fact, you KNOW they could have done better. If they were to make a fifth film, they better put some thought into it. If you're thinking about watching this movie only ONCE, you should see it in its intended format in 3D AND in theaters, but I don't see why anyone should waste their money on this film.",2,Take the

The real issue is at least two survivors are impossible to like, so the director kills them off rather quickly-what's the complaint, I don't have one, ha!First, there was the plane explosion, then there was the pile-up, followed by a roller-coaster disaster, now we have a race car track catastrophe. My biggest question is, what can they do next? The answer, alot! I don't want this franchise to end just yet. The critics totally missed the point of this series, it was far more original than any 'slasher film' I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of good and bad. My attitude with this series is: you aren't dealing with a knife-carrying psycho just out to kill people, with this series, you have more to work with, so please, a message to the creators, don't stop here!",4,"I don't have a favorite...., yet",1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,841,"['entry', 'shortest', 'not', 'problem', 'real', 'issue', 'least', 'two', 'survivors', 'are', 'impossible', 'like', 'director', 'off', 'rather', 'quickly-what', 'complaint', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'ha', 'First', 'was', 'plane', 'explosion', 'then', 'was', 'pile-up', 'followed', 'roller-coaster', 'disaster', 'now', 'have', 'race', 'car', 'track', 'catastrophe', 'biggest', 'question', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'next', 'answer', 'alot', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'franchise', 'end', 'just', 'yet', 'critics', 'totally', 'missed', 'point', 'series', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'original', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'share', 'good', 'bad', 'attitude', 'series', 'are', ""n't"", 'dealing', 'knife-carrying', 'psycho', 'just', 'kill', 'people', 'series', 'have', 'more', 'work', 'please', 'message', 'creators', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'here']",The Final Destination

FD4 is however a sharp drop in quality from the previous three entries in the profitable teen horror franchise.  FD1 formulates the general ideas (i.e. death and destiny) for the franchise.  FD2 is a great continuation.  FD3 has many great kills though the formula has got stale by then.  FD4 offers nothing new in terms of the story.  Kills are derivative and dull.  Digital blood and sanitized gore look laughably fake.  The opening race track crash and end theater explosion are sub par, comparing to the rollercoaster and subway train accidents in FD3.  The beauty parlor scene is a pale imitation of death by tanning beds in FD3.  The FD4 ending is so abrupt.  It left me scratch my head.I suppose that the main attraction is the 3D technology.  I saw it in 2D theater.  I doubt that 3D enhances the experience given an inept script and kills.My individual ratings of the four films are:FD1  9/10FD2  8/10FD3  7/10FD4  3/10",2,Avoid This Sequel Like Death,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,1020,"['Horror', 'movie', 'sequels', 'perfectly', 'concept', 'diminishing', 'return', 'economics', 'FD4', 'however', 'sharp', 'drop', 'quality', 'previous', 'three', 'entries', 'profitable', 'teen', 'horror', 'franchise', 'FD1', 'general', 'ideas', 'i.e', 'death', 'destiny', 'franchise', 'FD2', 'great', 'continuation', 'FD3', 'many', 'great', 'kills', 'formula', 'got', 'stale', 'then', 'FD4', 'nothing', 'new', 'terms', 'story', 'Kills', 'are', 'derivative', 'dull', 'Digital', 'blood', 'sanitized', 'gore', 'look', 'laughably', 'fake', 'opening', 'race', 'track', 'crash', 'end', 'theater', 'explosion', 'are', 'sub', 'par', 'comparing', 'rollercoaster', 'subway', 'train', 'accidents', 'FD3', 'beauty', 'parlor', 'scene', 'pale', 'imitation', 'death', 'tanning', 'beds', 'FD3', 'FD4', 'ending', 'so', 'abrupt', 'left', 'scratch', 'head.I', 'suppose', 'main', 'attraction', '3D', 'technology', 'saw', '2D', 'theater', 'doubt', '3D', 'enhances', 'experience', 'given', 'inept', 'script', 'kills.My', 'individual', 'ratings', 'four', 'films', 'are', 'FD1', '9/10FD2', '8/10FD3', '7/10FD4', '3/10']",The Final Destination
