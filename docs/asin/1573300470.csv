Video quality in the studio is not great. The weirdest thing is how abruptly the DVD ends almost like a mistake.

It includes interviews of the band members, as well as video of the band rehearsing. The video and sound quality are really good. This is definitely one of the best Aerosmith videos available. I love it and would recommend it to anyone! A must-have for any Aerosmith fan!!",5,Awesome!,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,387,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'videos', 'Aerosmith', 'one', 'awesome', 'video', 'band', 'making', 'pump', 'album', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'as', 'well', 'video', 'band', 'rehearsing', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'Aerosmith', 'videos', 'available', 'love', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'must-have', 'Aerosmith', 'fan']",Aerosmith - The Making of Pump

Thankfully the band was able to rise above the problems that could have ended their career so badly and managed to release an excellent album called Pump.  Aerosmith truly is one of the greatest comeback stories in the history of rock and roll.

I also enjoyed the look at the personalites of the band members that you don't get from stage performances or videos.  This is a ""getting to know you"" kind of video.

Gary Buglass,"[13, 18]","not bad in terms of seeing the bad boys of boston behind the scenes in the studio but bad in terms of dvd entertainment - no special features, no menu, there isn't even any artwork on the disc.I think I speak on behalf of most Aerosmith fans when I say that the record company needs to release an Aerosmith concert on DVD for us. They must be the only band in the world that don't have a live concert to buy whenever you walk into a virgin megastore or a wallmart! It's frustrating! They should have even released an &quot;OH YEAH! GREATEST VIDEO HITS&quot; to coincide with the CD &amp; the dvd could have had special features to make up for the songs without videos - for example big ten inch live, dream on live, etc. Surely this would have been more exciting to us fans than this!!No wonder Aerosmith don't get the recognition they deserve if you cant even buy a concert or video compilation on DVD.",2,average,1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,903,"['not', 'bad', 'terms', 'seeing', 'bad', 'boys', 'boston', 'scenes', 'studio', 'bad', 'terms', 'dvd', 'entertainment', 'special', 'features', 'menu', ""n't"", 'even', 'artwork', 'disc.I', 'think', 'speak', 'behalf', 'most', 'Aerosmith', 'fans', 'when', 'say', 'record', 'company', 'release', 'Aerosmith', 'concert', 'DVD', 'must', 'be', 'only', 'band', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'live', 'concert', 'buy', 'whenever', 'walk', 'virgin', 'megastore', 'wallmart', 'frustrating', 'should', 'have', 'even', 'released', 'quot', 'OH', 'YEAH', 'GREATEST', 'VIDEO', 'HITS', 'quot', 'coincide', 'CD', 'amp', 'dvd', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'special', 'features', 'make', 'up', 'songs', 'videos', 'example', 'big', 'ten', 'inch', 'live', 'dream', 'live', 'etc', 'Surely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'exciting', 'fans', 'wonder', 'Aerosmith', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'recognition', 'deserve', 'cant', 'even', 'buy', 'concert', 'video', 'compilation', 'DVD']",Aerosmith - The Making of Pump

This DVD has 2 sides.  I loved learning about how much time goes into making an album and how they come up with songs.  I'll definitely be buying other Aerosmith DVD's and learning more about them since they haven't been on Vh1's Behind The Music in forever.  I highly recommend buying this.

188166,A3J4PS26Q3UHO3,1573300470,S. Price,"[19, 20]","This DVD was exactly what I had hoped for. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't want a DVD of their video catalog.  Although videos are great, they are &quot;performance pieces&quot; and you can catch those any time you want on MTV.  This DVD brings you inside the studio .. and, in truth, inside the very creative minds of the members of the band.  You get to see exactly what process they go thru to create their masterpieces.  The DVD includes moments of brilliance, frustration, friendship, anger and sheer joy at realizing that their project is complete.  All five members of the band are showcased and it becomes clear how each one is vital to the survival of the group as a whole.  They candidly discuss their years of &quot;drinking and drugging&quot; .. and the lessons that they learned from it along the way.  Being a musician myself, I was fascinated with the recording process and the methods the band-mates utilize to achieve a finished product.  You get to hear the (now famous) hits in their infancy stages -- different lyrics, different music, etc. -- and the steps that were taken along the way to create the songs as we now know them.  You see the anguish the guys go through when one of their songs is cut from an album.  As Joe Perry puts it .. &quot;these songs are their babies and somebody else gets to decide which of them will grow up .. and which ones won't&quot;.Unlike the theatrical quality that you see in a produced music video, this DVD shows you the guys as they REALLY are.  It even opens by hearing Joe Perry urinating in the toilet while he is talking to Steven about a song they are working on.  It is clear that this is just an &quot;ordinary&quot; recording day for the guys.  No stage make-up, no theatrics for the camera .. just the intricate thought process that goes into creating a work of art.As a bonus, you do get to see two &quot;finished&quot; numbers .. &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot; and &quot;The Other Side&quot; and you appreciate them so much more having seen how every note was laid down -- all the way down to the background speaking noises for their videos or &quot;opening clips&quot; before songs.Before I saw this DVD, I was a huge Aerosmith fan ... but I really only knew background info on the two &quot;stars&quot; .. Steven and Joe Perry.  I was very pleased to get to learn more about the other three members of the band and how they all contribute to the workings of the &quot;machine&quot;.I highly recommend this DVD to anybody who is interested in HOW the songs are created.  From humming and knee-slapping (pre-lyrics) to the glorious finished products that we have come to recognize as true masterpieces of music.",5,I Got &quot;Pumped&quot; Watching This,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,2683,"['DVD', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'DVD', 'video', 'catalog', 'videos', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'quot', 'performance', 'pieces', 'quot', 'can', 'catch', 'time', 'want', 'MTV', 'DVD', 'studio', '..', 'truth', 'very', 'creative', 'minds', 'members', 'band', 'get', 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'process', 'go', 'thru', 'create', 'masterpieces', 'DVD', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'frustration', 'friendship', 'anger', 'sheer', 'joy', 'realizing', 'project', 'complete', 'five', 'members', 'band', 'are', 'showcased', 'clear', 'how', 'one', 'vital', 'survival', 'group', 'whole', 'candidly', 'discuss', 'years', 'quot', 'drinking', 'drugging', 'quot', 'lessons', 'learned', 'way', 'Being', 'musician', 'was', 'fascinated', 'recording', 'process', 'methods', 'band-mates', 'utilize', 'achieve', 'finished', 'product', 'get', 'hear', 'now', 'famous', 'hits', 'infancy', 'stages', 'different', 'lyrics', 'different', 'music', 'etc', 'steps', 'were', 'taken', 'way', 'create', 'songs', 'now', 'know', 'see', 'anguish', 'guys', 'go', 'when', 'one', 'songs', 'cut', 'album', 'Joe', 'Perry', '..', 'quot', 'songs', 'are', 'babies', 'somebody', 'else', 'decide', 'will', 'grow', 'up', '..', 'ones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'quot', '.Unlike', 'theatrical', 'quality', 'see', 'produced', 'music', 'video', 'DVD', 'guys', 'REALLY', 'are', 'even', 'hearing', 'Joe', 'Perry', 'urinating', 'toilet', 'talking', 'Steven', 'song', 'are', 'working', 'clear', 'just', 'quot', 'ordinary', 'quot', 'recording', 'day', 'guys', 'stage', 'make-up', 'theatrics', 'camera', '..', 'just', 'intricate', 'thought', 'process', 'creating', 'work', 'art.As', 'bonus', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'two', 'quot', 'finished', 'quot', 'numbers', '..', 'quot', 'Love', 'Elevator', 'quot', 'quot', 'Other', 'Side', 'quot', 'appreciate', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'having', 'seen', 'how', 'note', 'was', 'laid', 'down', 'way', 'background', 'speaking', 'noises', 'videos', 'quot', 'opening', 'clips', 'quot', 'songs.Before', 'saw', 'DVD', 'was', 'huge', 'Aerosmith', 'fan', 'really', 'only', 'knew', 'background', 'info', 'two', 'quot', 'stars', 'quot', 'Steven', 'Joe', 'Perry', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'get', 'learn', 'more', 'other', 'three', 'members', 'band', 'how', 'contribute', 'workings', 'quot', 'machine', 'quot', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anybody', 'who', 'interested', 'HOW', 'songs', 'are', 'created', 'humming', 'knee-slapping', 'pre-lyrics', 'glorious', 'finished', 'products', 'have', 'come', 'recognize', 'true', 'masterpieces', 'music']",Aerosmith - The Making of Pump
