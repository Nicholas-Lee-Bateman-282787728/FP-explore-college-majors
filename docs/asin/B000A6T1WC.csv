What I can't understand is that there are two series to go before the DVD collection is complete.  Two seasons & one special.  Where are they????  The waiting is ridiculous!  I have e-mailed Acorn Media to enquire about the remaining seasons coming to DVD & have not heard anything back.  I will try yet again to get another e-mail to them.[...]I strongly implore all fans of fine british comedy & Butterflies, to let them know we want all the rest of the episodes & can be as stubborn as necessary till we get them.  I can see a couple of years between releases, but this length of time is insane.Anyway, yes, I obviously highly recommend Butterflies (seasons 1 & 2 & the rest whenever they are put to DVD)! ;-)",5,"Wonderful set, but we NEED THE REST!",1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,801,"['been', 'years', 'Butterflies', 'Series', '1', '2', 'were', 'released', 'DVD', 'here', 'U.S..', 'What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'are', 'two', 'series', 'go', 'DVD', 'collection', 'complete', 'Two', 'seasons', 'one', 'special', 'Where', 'are', 'waiting', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'e-mailed', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'enquire', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'coming', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'anything', 'back', 'will', 'try', 'yet', 'again', 'get', 'e-mail', 'them.', '[', ']', 'strongly', 'implore', 'fans', 'fine', 'british', 'comedy', 'Butterflies', 'let', 'know', 'want', 'rest', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'stubborn', 'necessary', 'till', 'get', 'can', 'see', 'couple', 'years', 'releases', 'length', 'time', 'insane.Anyway', 'yes', 'obviously', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Butterflies', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'rest', 'whenever', 'are', 'put', 'DVD']",Butterflies - Series 2

922518,A3BS7G16IV0UW0,B000A6T1WC,"Frank P ""Franco""","[0, 1]","This is an over the top period piece from the sixties or early seventies I would guess.If you've ever been in a relationship where you are undervalued but afraid to burn your bridges you'll enjoy this immensely.Wendy Craig is intelligent, vivacious and caring.  Geoffrey Palmer, (who seems to be in most BritComs) the husband, truly loves Ria, but has the worse sense of timing and is always doing the wrong thing.  He wants to change but is stuck in his old school chauvanism. Her two sons pour gasoline on the relationship but mean well. Between some very poignant moments, you'll find yourself laughing.  Set at the dawn of the women's lib movement, Wendy is torn between being unfaithful with an unwanted suitor and constantly giving her situation another chance.  I suspect it could become therapy if viewed with your significant other.  Overall, excellent, well done and one of my favorite guilty pleasures.",5,Flirting with disaster and loving it.,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,913,"['top', 'period', 'piece', 'sixties', 'early', 'seventies', 'would', 'guess.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'relationship', 'where', 'are', 'undervalued', 'afraid', 'burn', 'bridges', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'immensely.Wendy', 'Craig', 'intelligent', 'vivacious', 'caring', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'who', 'be', 'most', 'BritComs', 'husband', 'truly', 'Ria', 'worse', 'sense', 'timing', 'always', 'doing', 'wrong', 'thing', 'change', 'stuck', 'old', 'school', 'chauvanism', 'two', 'sons', 'pour', 'gasoline', 'relationship', 'mean', 'well', 'Between', 'very', 'poignant', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'find', 'laughing', 'Set', 'dawn', 'women', 'lib', 'movement', 'Wendy', 'torn', 'being', 'unfaithful', 'unwanted', 'suitor', 'constantly', 'giving', 'situation', 'chance', 'suspect', 'could', 'become', 'therapy', 'viewed', 'significant', 'other', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'favorite', 'guilty', 'pleasures']",Butterflies - Series 2

She has a loving husband, who is rather boring and two grown sons who keep her in constant flux.  Add to this a millionaire who is infatuated with her.Season Two has eight 30 minute episodes on two discs.  The episodes shown on PBS were only 28 minutes.Disc One:Episode 1 -  Adam has been dumped by his girlfriend Annie and is in a funk over it.  Now the family must get him up again.  But remember that no matter how bad things get Ria's cooking will always be worse.Episode 2 - Rhea is upset by a fox hunt and decides to have a protest (this was a very big issue at the time.)  This leaves the boys to make lunch for Ben - and they have inherited their mother's cooking talents.Episode 3 - Ben has chest pains and begins to think about his old age.  Ria decides to cook to help him stay fit (do I need to say more) and of course runs into Leonard.  Ben takes up jogging and runs into Leonard (of course he doesn't know who Leonard is!)Episode 4 - The Parkinsons get new neighbors across the road.  Ben is forced to meet the husband when the boys throw their Frisbee in his car.  Ria is having one of ""her days"".

(This is one of the great episodes)Disc Two:Episode 5 - Leonard is sick.  Ben has to cope with the boys and their girls making out all over the house.  When Ria does not run into Leonard, she gets worried.  Ria tries to be more romantic with Ben.Episode 6 - A holiday acquaintance comes to visit and stirs up trouble.Episode 7 - Leonard tells Ria goodbye.  Ben talks to the boys about life.  Ben books a table at the restaurant where she and Leonard met.Episode 8 - This is the Christmas Special. It was never aired on PBS.
