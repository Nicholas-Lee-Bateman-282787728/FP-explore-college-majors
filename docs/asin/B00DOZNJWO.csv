I have two VHS versions of the movie, and one I taped off of Showtime.  I have gone through all the movies and am hoping that the five minutes that have been removed from the VHS versions is back in.  I don't know who decided to take it out but there are things in the movie that don't make sense without those minutes.  So I am hoping that they will be back in the movie.

1660186,AXP8ULN4FULTS,B00DOZNJWO,"Robyn B. Mcgorm ""tiddles""","[0, 0]","A wonderful story of love finding a different way and bringing different cultures together. There's plenty of action with a twist here and there so be careful when watching that you don't miss them. Set in the Sahara desert all about car racing for endurance and winning the race so it makes a name in the motor trade. Brooke is racing her fathers car when she is kidnapped by a sheik  wanting another woman to add to his harem and some  things don't go as planned. Throw in a handsome younger man would be more like it so you will have to wait about the events that continue to happen and who wins. The handsome man, older man or Brooke winning the finishing line and than who gets the heart. So I rated this an A grade plus for keeping it interesting and having you thinking what's going on with suspense. Now it's time for the popcorn and snacks so you can get down into the itty gritty of this movie while relaxing with your feet up for an unusual plus fabulous night in with a grand old classic.
