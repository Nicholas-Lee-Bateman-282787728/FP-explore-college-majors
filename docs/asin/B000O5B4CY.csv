The good guys lose too much; the bad guys win too much.  The Nazis do not get hurt enough.  Perhaps the movie is too realistic to be entertaining; being in Nazi-occupied France in WW II was not much fun.  I was not born then; perhaps the movie does show you what it was like on the individual level.

1062444,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B000O5B4CY,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","Went into this thinking this was another from the Hallmark/Lifetime movie mill - and was pleasantly surprised at this primarily French/Belgian production.Surprise number one - It wasn't an American story that takes place in World War II occupied Belgium. Rather this was a WWII occupied Belgian story with an American element woven into it's storyline.Surprise number two - I appreciate the fact that a significant portion of the film is spoken in French with English subtitles. Thankfully the filmmakers didn't try to Americanize the characters, which often weakens the performances, even falling into caricature. The cast of Resistance didn't take that route and it's a much better film for it.And surprise number three - The female cast carries a significant portion of the plot, revealing the strength of women in general - but specifically women who are living in an occupied country. What they feel, how they perceive the same situation differently than men, the core strength that they carry within themselves.The weak element, and other reviewers have made mention of it, is the almost paradoxical approach that Paxton's character, the lone survivor of a crashed reconnaissance plane, reacts to when he finds himself squirreled away. He doesn't quite understand or appreciate the suffering and sheer terror that the Maquis resistance must face in order to protect him. I can see why some might find it off-putting, and even unrealistic, that he seems to be so disconnected from his situation.But I would argue that that's the point.Firstly, he's an American, where suffering constitutes having to use food and fuel script - not subjugation, torture and execution. Second, he's a pilot. Of all the combat forces, it would be the pilots, who (bravely) fought the war tens of thousands of feet in the air; they might not quite understand what happens on the ground - he wouldn't understand it the way an infantryman might. And lastly, he's as American as one can be - eternally optimistic. Those things combined, at least to me, reflects an accurate and truer performance.Acting, characterization, storytelling - all of solid quality and depth.I'm not going to say this should've been an Oscar contender - but there is much more here than meets the eye.",4,Deeper Than Expected,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,2258,"['Went', 'thinking', 'was', 'Hallmark/Lifetime', 'movie', 'mill', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'primarily', 'French/Belgian', 'production.Surprise', 'number', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'American', 'story', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'occupied', 'Belgium', 'was', 'WWII', 'occupied', 'Belgian', 'story', 'American', 'element', 'woven', 'storyline.Surprise', 'number', 'two', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'significant', 'portion', 'film', 'spoken', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Thankfully', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'Americanize', 'characters', 'often', 'performances', 'even', 'falling', 'caricature', 'cast', 'Resistance', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'route', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'it.And', 'surprise', 'number', 'three', 'female', 'cast', 'significant', 'portion', 'plot', 'revealing', 'strength', 'women', 'general', 'specifically', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'occupied', 'country', 'What', 'feel', 'how', 'perceive', 'same', 'situation', 'differently', 'men', 'core', 'strength', 'carry', 'themselves.The', 'weak', 'element', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'mention', 'almost', 'paradoxical', 'approach', 'Paxton', 'character', 'lone', 'survivor', 'crashed', 'reconnaissance', 'plane', 'reacts', 'when', 'squirreled', 'away', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'suffering', 'sheer', 'terror', 'Maquis', 'resistance', 'must', 'face', 'order', 'protect', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'might', 'find', 'off-putting', 'even', 'unrealistic', 'be', 'so', 'disconnected', 'situation.But', 'would', 'argue', 'point.Firstly', 'American', 'where', 'suffering', 'constitutes', 'having', 'use', 'food', 'fuel', 'script', 'not', 'subjugation', 'torture', 'execution', 'Second', 'pilot', 'combat', 'forces', 'would', 'be', 'pilots', 'who', 'bravely', 'fought', 'war', 'tens', 'thousands', 'feet', 'air', 'might', 'not', 'quite', 'understand', 'what', 'ground', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'way', 'infantryman', 'might', 'lastly', 'as', 'American', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'eternally', 'optimistic', 'things', 'combined', 'least', 'accurate', 'truer', 'performance.Acting', 'characterization', 'storytelling', 'solid', 'quality', 'depth.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'eye']",Resistance
