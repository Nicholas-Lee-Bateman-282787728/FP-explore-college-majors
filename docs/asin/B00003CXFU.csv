If you're a girl, it has Roberts in skimpy clothing acting...and acting well.  In a script that seems tailor-made for her, Julia Roberts makes the most out of being witty, quirky and beautiful. That this is based on a true-story is typically grounds for me to start groaning.  Still, it had Roberts in skimpy clothing...so I bit.  I'm glad I did.  Albert Finney is a definite supporting Oscar favorite at this point and Julia should have a lock on a nomination as well (and should win the Globe for best comedic).  The witty repartee between these two alone makes Brockovich a worthy film, but add in across-the-board solid acting by the rest of the supporting cast (including my favorite underused film actress, Cherry Jones) and you have a delightful film that should be the highlight of any dinner party you throw at home.",4,Wonderful performance by Roberts,970012800,"09 27, 2000",2000,917,"['film', 'something', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'guy', 'Roberts', 'skimpy', 'clothing', ""'re"", 'girl', 'Roberts', 'skimpy', 'clothing', 'acting', 'acting', 'well', 'script', 'tailor-made', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'most', 'being', 'witty', 'quirky', 'beautiful', 'based', 'true-story', 'typically', 'grounds', 'start', 'groaning', 'Still', 'had', 'Roberts', 'skimpy', 'clothing', 'so', 'bit', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'definite', 'supporting', 'Oscar', 'favorite', 'point', 'Julia', 'should', 'have', 'lock', 'nomination', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'win', 'Globe', 'best', 'comedic', 'witty', 'repartee', 'two', 'alone', 'Brockovich', 'worthy', 'film', 'add', 'across-the-board', 'solid', 'acting', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'favorite', 'underused', 'film', 'actress', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'have', 'delightful', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'highlight', 'dinner', 'party', 'throw', 'home']",Erin Brockovich VHS
524142,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00003CXFU,A Customer,"[1, 3]","Summary:Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an ex-beauty queen with three children, two ex-husbands, no job, and no job skills. The movie begins with Erin flubbing a job interview and getting in an accident. She hires Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to sue the other driver. When Ed loses the case Erin demands he give her a job. He does and when she takes a personal interest in a pro bono case that turns out to be a major civil suite, Ed and Erin push it through to victory landing a multi-million dollar settlement against Pacific Gas and Electric. Though Erin isn't a legal expert, she is a people person and it's through her efforts that the case is really won.My Comments:The movie isn't particularly quick, suspenseful, or exciting, but it is remarkably well-produced. The cinematography is great; some of the scenes are even shot in Hinkley, CA, giving the movie a very authentic feel. Ed, Erin, and George (Aaron Eckhart) - the three main actors - are great and well-portrayed.I felt like I was left not knowing what turns out with George, Erin's boyfriend, and there is only one scene of Erin informing people of the court's decision. Too much time was spent on Erin collecting plaintiffs in Hinkley and not enough on her relationship with George and her kids, unless, of course, she really was incredibly neglectful of her family and friends.I'm doing my best to not comment on the story itself, because it is a true story, but I couldn't help but see Erin as an annoying pain. Perhaps that means Julia Roberts did a good job, nevertheless, I wouldn't mind avoiding someone as caustic as Erin was portrayed in my personal life.Overall, the movie is entertaining and well done with just a few flaws. If you like Julia Roberts or legal films, you'll probably enjoy this film.

She leaves disappointed, and her car is hit when someone drives through a red light. The testimony in court doesn't go well; inappropriate language for this young mother may prejudice the jury. [Unfair, but that is life.] She applies for jobs over the phone. No experience? Erin gets a job at that law firm. She meets the new neighbors. Does she have problems at work? Erin learns why there are medical records in a real estate file. The Jensen family has medical problems. Chromium is involved, it can be deadly. There is a factory a few hundred yards away. Erin searches the records at the water board and finds evidence of pollution. Was she a beauty queen? [Looks aren't everything, manners count.]Lawyer Ed Masry drops by for information. Erin gets even more information. Did PG&E; pay for that doctor? The illnesses of the Jensen family can be explained by exposure to chromium hexavalent-6. ""Wow!"". Former neighbors of the Jensen's visit the office for advice. Lawyer Ed explains the laws, Erin explains the costs of litigation. Erin wears sandals in a barn yard! She talks to other neighbors. There are four more families involved. Can Erin find the evidence for law suits? Will she be threatened? Will the case become too large for a small firm? The judge upholds the suits, they will go to trial. Erin's job made her respected by people. [Feared rather than loved?] Masry has a new partner with the most experience in toxic tort law.PG&E; wants the case settled by arbitration. Erin still has a problem in dealing with people. Lawyer Theresa does not have the common touch. There is a problem in their suits, all of the plaintiffs must agree. If they don't use binding arbitration the case can go on for 15 or 20 years. Erin gets the signatures of the plaintiffs. Would a chance meeting bring new evidence? ""How did you do this?"" The judge decides for the plaintiffs, the amount is on the high end. Erin, ever abrasive, gets a surprise from Lawyer Ed. ""Do beauty queens know how to apologize?"" The settlement in Hinkley vs. PG&E; was the largest award in a direct-action lawsuit in US history.

524147,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXFU,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I don't understand how anyone couldn't love Julia Roberts.  I mean I guess I can see how maybe she just isn't your brand of actress, but truly, she is extraordinary.  She has turned out classic performance after classic performance and is a standup person to boot.  Her portrayal of Erin Brockovich may actually be one of her most challenging roles and she delivers it with such precise determination and dedication that she becomes so real and engaging and truly memorable.  The best thing about `Erin Brockovich' though is that Roberts is not the only reason to stay and watch.  Sure, she has everything a movie star needs to keep her audience at her beck-and-call, but Soderbergh (who had such a marvelous year in 2000) doesn't rely solely on Roberts to carry his film.`Erin Brockovich' sports a brilliant script penned by Susannah Grant that utilizes fact with Hollywood drama and peppers in enough humor and charm to make the film stand out apart from your everyday biopic.The film tells to story of Erin Brockovich, a brash young single mother who winds up working for attorney Ed Masry.  Erin doesn't always rub people the right way, but her blunt self-confidence carries her a long way in the legal world, especially when she takes it upon herself to investigate further a case involving a power company and their blatant disregard for the health of the citizens of Hinkley, California.  As Erin becomes absorbed in the case her personal life starts to take a turn as she meets her kind-hearted yet gruff-exteriored neighbor George.  `Erin Brockovich' does a masterful job of melding this woman's personal and professional life together in a way that makes both sides of her interesting and entertaining, never once waning.One of the main reasons to watch this film is to witness the rapport between the actors on the screen.  Julia Roberts is a standout, obviously, but everyone involved pulls their weight and works wonderfully together.  Albert Finney is flawless as Ed Masry and should have won that Oscar.  His chemistry with Roberts is beautiful to witness, just beautiful.  In infuses this sense of paternal concern into his performance that makes Masry a likable and relatable character.  Another standout is Aaron Eckhart who marvelously captures the heart of George.  He plays to Roberts strengths and helps keep the personal side of this story lively and tender.In the end, `Erin Brockovich' is a film that stands on its own, a film that deserves to be seen and lauded.  Roberts received countless amounts of praise for her performance (and a much deserved Oscar to boot) but I think the Academy Award nominations for Supporting Actor, Screenplay, Director and Best Picture speak for themselves in declaring just how impressive this film really is.",5,"Cheeky, brazen and extremely clever; this is a film to love...",1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,2767,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', ""n't"", 'love', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'mean', 'guess', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'maybe', 'just', ""n't"", 'brand', 'actress', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'turned', 'out', 'classic', 'performance', 'classic', 'performance', 'standup', 'person', 'boot', 'portrayal', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'challenging', 'roles', 'such', 'precise', 'determination', 'dedication', 'so', 'real', 'engaging', 'truly', 'memorable', 'best', 'thing', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'though', 'Roberts', 'not', 'only', 'reason', 'stay', 'watch', 'Sure', 'everything', 'movie', 'star', 'needs', 'keep', 'audience', 'beck-and-call', 'Soderbergh', 'who', 'had', 'marvelous', 'year', '2000', ""n't"", 'rely', 'solely', 'Roberts', 'carry', 'film.', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'sports', 'brilliant', 'script', 'penned', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'fact', 'Hollywood', 'drama', 'peppers', 'enough', 'humor', 'charm', 'make', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'apart', 'everyday', 'biopic.The', 'film', 'tells', 'story', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'brash', 'young', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'up', 'working', 'attorney', 'Ed', 'Masry', 'Erin', ""n't"", 'always', 'rub', 'people', 'right', 'way', 'blunt', 'self-confidence', 'long', 'way', 'legal', 'world', 'especially', 'when', 'investigate', 'further', 'case', 'involving', 'power', 'company', 'blatant', 'disregard', 'health', 'citizens', 'Hinkley', 'California', 'Erin', 'absorbed', 'case', 'personal', 'life', 'take', 'turn', 'kind-hearted', 'yet', 'gruff-exteriored', 'neighbor', 'George', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'masterful', 'job', 'melding', 'woman', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'together', 'way', 'sides', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'never', 'once', 'waning.One', 'main', 'reasons', 'watch', 'film', 'witness', 'rapport', 'actors', 'screen', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'standout', 'obviously', 'everyone', 'involved', 'pulls', 'weight', 'wonderfully', 'together', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'flawless', 'Ed', 'Masry', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'chemistry', 'Roberts', 'beautiful', 'witness', 'just', 'beautiful', 'infuses', 'sense', 'paternal', 'concern', 'performance', 'Masry', 'likable', 'relatable', 'character', 'standout', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'marvelously', 'heart', 'George', 'Roberts', 'strengths', 'keep', 'personal', 'side', 'story', 'lively', 'tender.In', 'end', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'film', 'own', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'lauded', 'Roberts', 'received', 'countless', 'amounts', 'praise', 'performance', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'boot', 'think', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Screenplay', 'Director', 'Best', 'Picture', 'speak', 'declaring', 'just', 'how', 'impressive', 'film', 'really']",Erin Brockovich VHS

But while the story may be more than a little predictable for anyone who's ever seen, well, anything -- it's also a pretty great movie, is terrifically directed by Soderbergh, and is fueled by a wonderful, sassy, and complex performance by Julia Roberts.  The DVD is a must, and offers some great extras as narrated by Soderbergh, as well as interviews with the real Brockovich, and a look at an alternate (and completely factual) storyline which was ultimately edited out from the film, and which shows that, for once, Hollywood actually toned DOWN the real events for their translation to film.My favorite things about &quot;Brockovich&quot; were the little touches -- the realistic look at the life of a struggling single mother who's this close to screaming in frustration, the wonderful supporting characters, and the way the wardrobe really seemed to provide Roberts with a completely new character than any other we've seen her play.  Erin is loud, sassy, foul-mouthed, impatient, and rude.  She's also a heck of a lot smarter and more compassionate than she lets on, and takes us on a great ride.  Albert Finney is also equally wonderful as Erin's surprisingly caring boss -- there's a priceless scene where she gets him to let his hair down and do a little screaming, and Finney is just wonderful in it.Erin Brockovich is a great movie, a movie that redefines what the phrase crowd-pleaser is really supposed to mean.

She's always great - but this isn't the sweet role she usually plays. I think I heard someone compare her performance to Sally Field in Norma Rae, and I'd second that. She, as Field often does, nails the hard, rough exterior that holds back a tender, caring inside. Roberts is truly excellent in this movie - funny, quick, strong... just brilliant. Albert Finney is excellent as her 'sidekick' in this one - watching them together is truly a joy. You can see in their eyes they're enjoying their jobs, and I swear there were a few times when I caught Finney laughing, almost shocked about Roberts' performance. Regardless, it was an incredible duo. This kind of age difference is hard to accomplish, (see Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery in Entrapment) - but this one works well.The script is also great - although there are many points when you can feel the fact the writers were trying to squeeze too much in. But - it does it well. John Travolta starred in A Civil Action, a very similar movie, but one which I was ready to leave after a half an hour - Brockovich, despite running about the same time, seems to go by much quicker.Overall - you gotta see this movie.

524153,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,B00003CXFU,atmj,"[0, 1]","As a Julia Roberts fan, first I'm biased.  However, there was a good story  here and though I think Julia Roberts was great for the part, another  equally skilled actress could have done as well.The acting was wonderful  by all, including that by Albert Finney that played her bumbling lawyer  boss; Ed Masry.  The character he played was a smart man, but was not  skilled in speaking.  A scary thought for an attorney.As with many  others, I did find Julia Roberts outfits overly provocative, but if they  were in character, then they were appropriate.  However, what I did fault  with is the endless variety and quality of these outfits.  If she was  single mom with two kids and struggling to eat, her wardrobe never  reflected it.  All of her clothes appeared expensive and worn once.  The  wardrobe person should be faulted here and the director for not adhering to  reality.The story is one of this woman's brashness in resolving her and  others problems.  Erin Brockovich, went to Ed Masry to obtain a settlement  for an injury obtained in a car accident.  He assured her of their success.  Unfortunately, through his bumbling and her appearance and attitude which  did not endear her to the judge, she lost the case.She approached this  attorney shortly after winning the case, for a job, since he had done her  no favors in the courtroom and he grudgingly gave her one much to the  consternation of the rest of his staff.Later on she noted some  oddities in one of his files and asked to pursue the lead.  He  absentmindedly told her it was okay.  However, after a week of absence due  to researching this, he fired her.  His staff was openly pleased and she  left in a huff.Later, when calls started to come in that her research  initiated, her former boss came to her for more information.  Recognizing a  golden opportunity she negotiated for her job back at a better rate with  benefits!Shortly after returning to work she met her next door  neighbor that was soon to become her babysitter and eventually her love  interest.  This resulted in some bedroom scenes were she gave some of her  background and you could understand some of what drives her.  George her  boyfriend/babysitter played back fiddle to her job through most of the  movie and winds up leaving because of this.  You can really see the pull of  both.As time went on she pieced together the whole sordid story of what  went on.  Once the corporate bigwigs got hold of this she received some  threats and leads started to dry up.As a small law firm, they  struggled with the manpower to support and try such a large case.  They  opt to get a partner with more experience to help them.  Here Erin feels  really pushed out.  She struggles against the bias over both her lack of  education besides her trashy dress.In the end they triumphed.  This  isn't quite so simple there are a lot of twists and turns and details, all  well done.Not knowing the personality of the real Erin Brockovich, I  don't know if Julia Roberts portrayed her accurately or not.  However  there is a lesson learned here as well.  If you choose a path you know to  have biases, dressing trashy, working in a field that you have no  qualifications for, you wind up aways fighting to prove you can do the job.  Human nature is that it wants homogeneity.  You have to fit, otherwise your  differences are something you have to add to that hill you have to climb  over every day.  Erin Brockovich chose that battle and triumphed.  I'm  not sure the battles (the trashy dress) were worth the fight, but it's not  my life.The other message here that in today's age, education is  merely a more formal doorway for various jobs.  If employers limit  themselves to only candidates with the right educational background despite  a job candidate's obvious ability, they may be shorting themselves.  So  much of many jobs are on the job knowledge and drive.  Erin Brockovich is a  good example of that.",5,This was a great movie,968025600,"09 4, 2000",2000,3942,"['Julia', 'Roberts', 'fan', 'first', ""'m"", 'biased', 'However', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'here', 'think', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'was', 'great', 'part', 'equally', 'skilled', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'well.The', 'acting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'including', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'played', 'bumbling', 'lawyer', 'boss', 'Ed', 'Masry', 'character', 'played', 'was', 'smart', 'man', 'was', 'not', 'skilled', 'speaking', 'scary', 'thought', 'attorney.As', 'many', 'others', 'did', 'find', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'overly', 'provocative', 'were', 'character', 'then', 'were', 'appropriate', 'However', 'what', 'did', 'fault', 'endless', 'variety', 'quality', 'outfits', 'was', 'single', 'mom', 'two', 'kids', 'struggling', 'eat', 'wardrobe', 'never', 'reflected', 'clothes', 'appeared', 'expensive', 'worn', 'once', 'wardrobe', 'person', 'should', 'be', 'faulted', 'here', 'director', 'not', 'adhering', 'reality.The', 'story', 'one', 'woman', 'brashness', 'resolving', 'others', 'problems', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'went', 'Ed', 'Masry', 'obtain', 'settlement', 'injury', 'obtained', 'car', 'accident', 'assured', 'success', 'Unfortunately', 'bumbling', 'appearance', 'attitude', 'did', 'not', 'endear', 'judge', 'lost', 'case.She', 'approached', 'attorney', 'shortly', 'winning', 'case', 'job', 'had', 'done', 'favors', 'courtroom', 'grudgingly', 'gave', 'one', 'much', 'consternation', 'rest', 'staff.Later', 'noted', 'oddities', 'one', 'files', 'asked', 'pursue', 'lead', 'absentmindedly', 'told', 'was', 'okay', 'However', 'week', 'absence', 'due', 'researching', 'fired', 'staff', 'was', 'openly', 'pleased', 'left', 'huff.Later', 'when', 'calls', 'started', 'come', 'research', 'initiated', 'former', 'boss', 'came', 'more', 'information', 'Recognizing', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'negotiated', 'job', 'back', 'better', 'rate', 'benefits', 'Shortly', 'returning', 'work', 'met', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'was', 'soon', 'become', 'babysitter', 'eventually', 'love', 'interest', 'resulted', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'were', 'gave', 'background', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'George', 'boyfriend/babysitter', 'played', 'back', 'fiddle', 'job', 'most', 'movie', 'up', 'leaving', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'pull', 'both.As', 'time', 'went', 'pieced', 'together', 'whole', 'sordid', 'story', 'what', 'went', 'corporate', 'bigwigs', 'got', 'hold', 'received', 'threats', 'leads', 'started', 'dry', 'up.As', 'small', 'law', 'firm', 'struggled', 'manpower', 'support', 'try', 'large', 'case', 'opt', 'get', 'partner', 'more', 'experience', 'help', 'Here', 'Erin', 'feels', 'really', 'pushed', 'out', 'bias', 'lack', 'education', 'trashy', 'dress.In', 'end', 'triumphed', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'simple', 'are', 'lot', 'twists', 'turns', 'details', 'well', 'knowing', 'personality', 'real', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'portrayed', 'accurately', 'not', 'However', 'lesson', 'learned', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'choose', 'path', 'know', 'have', 'biases', 'dressing', 'trashy', 'working', 'field', 'have', 'qualifications', 'wind', 'up', 'aways', 'fighting', 'prove', 'can', 'do', 'job', 'Human', 'nature', 'homogeneity', 'have', 'fit', 'otherwise', 'differences', 'are', 'something', 'have', 'add', 'hill', 'have', 'climb', 'over', 'day', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'chose', 'battle', 'triumphed', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'battles', 'trashy', 'dress', 'were', 'worth', 'fight', 'not', 'life.The', 'other', 'message', 'here', 'today', 'age', 'education', 'merely', 'more', 'formal', 'doorway', 'various', 'jobs', 'employers', 'limit', 'only', 'candidates', 'right', 'educational', 'background', 'job', 'candidate', 'obvious', 'ability', 'may', 'be', 'shorting', 'So', 'much', 'many', 'jobs', 'are', 'job', 'knowledge', 'drive', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'good', 'example']",Erin Brockovich VHS

This is a $100 million+ grossing wretched trash catered to the audience in the same fashion as Patch Adams. Anybody who loathes the manipulative, vulgar and sentimental Patch Adams will hate Erin Brockovich as well.  Steven Soderbergh directed this saponaceous and sanitized Hollywood version after his botched effort The Limey and he does with his annoying guerilla cinematic gimmicks as usual -- which is also an irritating factor of the film.  What really grates my nerve the most is not only Julia Roberts' bizarre and over-the-top portrayal of the real-life Erin Brockovich whose attitude and lifestyle are rude, irresponsible and repugnant but also the fact Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter seem to believe this is an important ""message movie"". If that's the actual intent of the film, then it fails because it definitely isn't the emotionally intense and sympathetic movie unlike Michael Mann's brilliant film The Insider. It just ends up cumbersome and retch-inducing with the forced ""stand-up-and-cheer happy ending"" that borders on utter audience manipulation. These and the steady stream of coarse and vulgar language throughout the movie -- especially in the scenes where Erin cuss at her kids and desecrated over 600 clients with her ""sexual favor"" reference intended as a sarcastic joke -- made me despise the movie with vehemence. If this movie was meant to reflect the exhibition of the vulgar attitude by the real-life Erin Brockovich, then I have no respect for her as an intelligible human being whatsoever.  Any movie glorifying the cynical attitude of the characters and screwed-up lifestyles like the ghastly overrated American Beauty do not deserve my respect.

Cunningham ""Cris Cunningham""","[15, 16]","Okay, language issues aside, Julia Roberts SHINES as the real-life Erin Brockovich, a dogged, unabashed crusader for justice.Erin accidentally finds out that several hundred unsuspecting residents of Hinkley, California are dead or dying from poisoned water that has exceedingly high levels of toxic chromium.This is a touching story that reminds me a lot of Sally Field's performance in Norma Rae. It's about a grass-roots effort to right a very terrible wrong, and the investigative techniques used by Erin will floor you with their sheer simplicity. It's not what she does, rather it's HOW she does what she does that makes a difference. Erin is not equipped professionally to take on this insurmountable task, but she refuses to let that stop her from trying. She's what I would call &quot;ignorance on fire&quot;, but she's also smart as a whip.What I love most about this movie is how Roberts character gets results when others can't. She may not be the most professional (this movie is cleavage city!), or meekest person you'll ever meet (her boss says she could use a good dose of ""charm school"" - he's right!) but she has a way with people. True, her wardrobe doesn't hurt in her getting her way so often (especially with men), but it's her honest compassion for these victims that makes the movie work.Erin Brockovich teaches all of us a lesson in true leadership, persistence against all odds, and how to motivate people. These victims TRUST her because they know she really CARES, That's the real lesson here, and that's why she is so successful in getting them to do something they would never have done without her.This movie is a real gem.

It seemed like a calculated move by Julia Roberts, Inc., to buy into the character market, the Norma Rae/Silkwood real estate. I thought it would be a star turn.  Roberts and the film are much better than that.  The filmmakers made some excellent choices in rendering the true story of a California legal office clerk who uncovers a ulitity's cover-up of an environmental disaster that has caused widespread health problems in a small town.  They have opted for realism, and have chosen to emphasize the entertaining ironies in Brockovich's character.  Roberts wears the role well and has let go of some trademark mannerisms.  Albert Finney, playing the lawyer for whom Brockovich works, is remarkable and deserves more attention than he's gotten.  The director wisely abandons the hand-held camera early enough, before it becomes annoying. The film slyly comments on legal culture when it puts Finney and Roberts' roll-up-the-sleeves characters in a room with the stiffly attired and mannered upscale corporate lawyers.  I suppose some people should be warned that the dialogue makes frequent use of those words that can't be broadcast on network television; but people I know who are usually offended by such liked this film because it has a humor and charm that pick it up off the ground.",4,"Worthwhile, entertaining and honest",983318400,"02 28, 2001",2001,1352,"['When', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'suspicious', 'seemed', 'calculated', 'move', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Inc.', 'buy', 'character', 'market', 'Norma', 'Rae/Silkwood', 'real', 'estate', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'star', 'turn', 'Roberts', 'film', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'excellent', 'choices', 'rendering', 'true', 'story', 'California', 'legal', 'office', 'clerk', 'who', 'ulitity', 'cover-up', 'environmental', 'disaster', 'caused', 'widespread', 'health', 'problems', 'small', 'town', 'have', 'opted', 'realism', 'have', 'chosen', 'emphasize', 'entertaining', 'ironies', 'Brockovich', 'character', 'role', 'well', 'let', 'go', 'trademark', 'mannerisms', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'playing', 'lawyer', 'whom', 'Brockovich', 'remarkable', 'more', 'attention', 'gotten', 'director', 'wisely', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'early', 'enough', 'annoying', 'film', 'slyly', 'comments', 'legal', 'culture', 'when', 'Finney', 'Roberts', 'roll-up-the-sleeves', 'characters', 'room', 'stiffly', 'attired', 'mannered', 'upscale', 'corporate', 'lawyers', 'suppose', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'dialogue', 'frequent', 'use', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'broadcast', 'network', 'television', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'usually', 'offended', 'such', 'liked', 'film', 'humor', 'charm', 'up', 'ground']",Erin Brockovich VHS

Julia gives such an effortless performance here that she doesn't even appear to be acting.  Everything is so natural, and that can be said for her cast mates as well.

He perfectly compliments her in every scene they share, and the same can be said for Aaron Eckhart who plays George, Erin's neighbor who falls in love with her and offers her the stability she's always needed and never received.

We know that Karen Silkwood is going to die under suspicious circumstances at the end of Silkwood and we know that the tobacco companies are going to pay at the end of The Insider. And since we saw Erin herself being interviewed on all of the major news programs when this film was released, we know that she is not going to be run off the road to be kept quiet. On the contrary, we're aware that she's going to help win a major case against a huge company. But this doesn't mean that these films still can't be amazingly entertaining.Despite these disadvantages, Brockovich's tale provides for one of the most engrossing films of the year due to the very entertaining script by Susannah Grant, the skill with which Steven Soderbergh unfolds the tale (the audience comes to sympathize completely with Erin whose character is in nearly every scene), and the terrific performance by Julia Roberts (sure to be nominated for an Oscar). And though Roberts dominates the entire film, Albert Finney offers some excellent support as her curmudgeon boss and Aaron Eckhart is fine as her sympathetic though neglected boyfriend.

Fincke ""thegreatfandincke""","[3, 7]","To start with the good, Julia Roberts's performance in this film is deserving of much of the acclaim it has received.  To the degree that her performance is a result of just doing &quot;whatever Steven Soderbergh told her to do,&quot; as I heard her claim in an interview, he deserves some credit.  Otherwise this guy seems to be getting WAY too much credit for his film.As a true story it is interesting that a woman with no prior law training or experience could achieve some of the things that Erin Brockovich apparently did.  And it is very inspirational how she personally knew all the details of all the clients' cases and all their phone numbers by heart, etc.  But these little tidbits are not the stuff of interesting filmmaking.  The story is way too familiar to be of any interest.  There are no surprises, there is no new revelation about corporations or about law or about human nature.  There is hardly any comedy, there is no really gripping drama, this is just a true story.  It could have been a TV movie!  Nothing is cinematically contributed to this story to warrant the jump from TV movie of the week or &quot;Dateline&quot; documentary to the big screen.  Is the story inspiring?  I guess so.  Is the movie?  As a movie?  No.  If you want stories of justice and injustice and the middle grounds between, which actually provoke thought into new directions and earn their emotional responses from the audience, look no further than David E. Kelley's brilliant TV show, &quot;The Practice.&quot;  A half an hour of which is ten times more gripping than Erin Brockovich.I have the sneaky suspicion that all the acclaim of this film is due to the political value these days on telling stories about evil corporations.  I don't think it really has anything to do with Soderbergh being a genius, because this film gives no evidence he is one, or this film being rousing, because it is not.  It is simply predictable and politically correct.  I do not mean to say that there are no evils contributed to American or global life by corporations, just that this film gains everything from what people expect to feel and want to feel about this familiar villainy and not from what it actually accomplishes in creating something truly insightful.  There are not even any new insights into the nature of corporate villainy where it exists.  This is simply an overrated film.But again, Julia is worth watching.

He comes across as a blatant plot device--a convenient way to show that Brockovich's kids are being cared for while she works overtime as well as provide a love interest whose only real purpose is to be neglected so we can see the impact of her job on her personal life.

Based on a true story, though doubtless with some Hollywood style touch-ups, this is a powerful tale of a bunch of disparate, ordinary individuals, none too aware or confident, fighting against a wealthy corporation that has played havoc with their lives. And the driving force behind this fight is Erin. Julia Roberts plays a scrappy survivor in this movie, loud, foul mouthed, but a fighter all the way. She makes no apologies for her self or her circumstances and manages to rub countless people the wrong way. Down on her luck and nearly out of funds with three kids to support, she bullies a lawyer who let her down into giving her a job (the responsibilities are never clear!). Once at the law office however, she learns in passing of a set of strange events centered around a power company that has been polluting the water supply in a town near its plant, and then suppressing all news of its activities till the statute of limitations can rescue it. Biting in like a bulldog, Erin-Julia hits the ground running, talks to the victims and slowly assembles a case. She has to fight the status quo all the way, be it her own boss (Albert Finney, superb in a well crafted role), his new partner, the power company itself, the legal system and for that matter her personal life. Left behind by her single minded quest, her boyfriend (an unbelievably soft and sensitive Harley Davidson biker!) bails out. But Erin has by now identified so closely with the victims that it has become a personal crusade for her and she cannot throw in the towel.

I guess that I'm in the extreme minority here -- but I didn't much care for the movie &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;.  I didn't find Brockovich to be an admirable person, much less a hero, and I have grave disappointments concerning the fidelity of the movie to actual events.Item:  Repeatedly throughout the movie, Ms. Brockovich is portrayed as &quot;doing this for her children&quot; or some similar line.  Yet her home life was chaotic at best, her relationship with her kids was awful, and her relationship with her boyfriend (who actually DID seem to care for the kids) was also unimpressive.  (She has since dumped him.)Item:  The movie played fast and loose with the actual facts of the matter.  In the months since the movie's release, numerous syndicated columnists have demonstrated scientific inaccuracies, fiscal irregularities as far as payments to &quot;victims&quot;, exorbident attorney's fees, etc.Item:  The heroic attorney figure has, in real life, not tended toward the highest examples of the ethics of his profession.  He was a religious cult lawyer, an attorney FOR polluters, and was a convicted felon.Item:  In real life, many residents of Hinckly are terribly bitter toward Brockovich.It's politically correct, nowadays, to bash large corporations as intrinsically evil.

524192,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00003CXFU,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 2]","Julia Roberts stars as an unrelentingly tactless, thoroughly tasteless, charm-school dropout twice divorced, the mother of three who dresses like a Las Vegas whore.  We love her.  She is a woman who's been disappointed a time or two and generally expects the worst, and when she doesn't get it, she's surprised.  She is her own worst enemy with a foul mouth and a skanky style and a chip on her shoulder.  She is also very smart and incredibly strong and knows right from wrong (and that's the chip on her other shoulder).  We love her.Stir in Richard Gere or Tom Cruise (no, he's too short)...  How about...no, no, NO.  Give her someone near her equal.  How about a real actor twice her age?  How about Albert Finney (whom I first saw in the delightful Tom Jones (1963))?  Together they play it like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy without the romance.  Not only does it work, it's a triumph.  Finney really is brilliant.  His timing is exquisite as is his ability to round his character.  Did you catch the shot of him with the one eye comically magnified through his glasses?  For love interest give her a bandana-wearing biker whom she turns into a house husband to take care of her kids while she takes on Pacific Gas and Electric (market cap = $28-billion).  For the first time in her life she is doing something important.  For the first time in her life people respect her.  There's something wonderful about this because even without an education people can see, and she can know, that she's their equal and maybe a bit more.Aaron Eckhart, lately seen as the sociopathic Chad in the startlingly original In the Company of Men (1997) plays the biker house husband with fidelity and a kind of sappy warmth.  She neglects him and her kids for her obsession.  Susannah Grant, who penned the very clever script must have gotten a good laugh with this unusual household, the poor, stay at home neglected husband, the always on the road wife.  Incidentally, don't miss the scene where he first kisses her.  It was so real all I could think was this guy is kissing Julia Roberts!  She is so powerfully expressive that everything she does is real.  That's her gift.A significant part of the success of Erin Brockovich of course is in the compelling (and substantially true) story of David versus Goliath (&quot;and all his relatives,&quot; as Finney quips), of good versus evil, of the &quot;little guy&quot; versus the corporate behemoth.  I won't be giving away anything by telling you that there's a happy ending.  But this is also a triumph for Director Steven Soderbergh who can now add a box office success to critical acclaim.  I haven't seen any of his latest movies,  (I'm looking forward to seeing Traffic), but I recall with pleasure the very interesting Sex, Lies, &amp; Videotape from 1989.  I am also looking forward to the Academy Awards presentations because I suspect the Academy is going to reward both Julia Roberts and Soderbergh by making Erin Brockovich the Best Picture of the year 2000.",5,Everything she does is real,981417600,"02 6, 2001",2001,3014,"['Julia', 'Roberts', 'unrelentingly', 'tactless', 'thoroughly', 'tasteless', 'charm-school', 'dropout', 'twice', 'divorced', 'mother', 'three', 'who', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'whore', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'disappointed', 'time', 'two', 'generally', 'worst', 'when', ""n't"", 'get', 'surprised', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'foul', 'mouth', 'skanky', 'style', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'also', 'very', 'smart', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'knows', 'right', 'wrong', 'chip', 'other', 'shoulder', 'love', 'her.Stir', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'too', 'short', 'How', 'NO', 'Give', 'someone', 'equal', 'How', 'real', 'actor', 'twice', 'age', 'How', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'whom', 'first', 'saw', 'delightful', 'Tom', 'Jones', '1963', 'Together', 'play', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'romance', 'Not', 'only', 'work', 'triumph', 'Finney', 'really', 'brilliant', 'timing', 'exquisite', 'ability', 'round', 'character', 'Did', 'catch', 'shot', 'one', 'eye', 'comically', 'magnified', 'glasses', 'love', 'interest', 'give', 'bandana-wearing', 'biker', 'whom', 'house', 'husband', 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'Pacific', 'Gas', 'Electric', 'market', 'cap', '=', '28-billion', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'doing', 'something', 'important', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'people', 'respect', 'something', 'wonderful', 'even', 'education', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'can', 'know', 'equal', 'maybe', 'bit', 'more.Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'lately', 'seen', 'sociopathic', 'Chad', 'startlingly', 'original', 'Company', 'Men', '1997', 'biker', 'house', 'husband', 'fidelity', 'kind', 'sappy', 'warmth', 'kids', 'obsession', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'who', 'penned', 'very', 'clever', 'script', 'must', 'have', 'gotten', 'good', 'laugh', 'unusual', 'household', 'poor', 'stay', 'home', 'neglected', 'husband', 'always', 'road', 'wife', 'Incidentally', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'scene', 'where', 'first', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'guy', 'kissing', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'so', 'powerfully', 'expressive', 'everything', 'real', 'gift.A', 'significant', 'part', 'success', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'course', 'compelling', 'substantially', 'true', 'story', 'David', 'versus', 'Goliath', 'quot', 'relatives', 'quot', 'Finney', 'quips', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'quot', 'little', 'guy', 'quot', 'corporate', 'behemoth', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'giving', 'away', 'anything', 'telling', 'happy', 'ending', 'also', 'triumph', 'Director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'who', 'can', 'now', 'add', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'latest', 'movies', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Traffic', 'recall', 'pleasure', 'very', 'interesting', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'amp', 'Videotape', '1989', 'am', 'also', 'looking', 'forward', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'presentations', 'suspect', 'Academy', 'going', 'reward', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Soderbergh', 'making', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year', '2000']",Erin Brockovich VHS

It is easy to have a real testimony to make your film and watching the extras (which alone would be rated 5) you find the film is a lovely story of struggle and desperation with a more-than-happy ending.

Roberts faces the  breakdown of her family as a single, raising her children, and there in  lies a pillion rider neighbor Albert Finney and her refreshing chemistry  with George in the attorney firm.It is her affection, her will and  strength that bolsters the drama and Roberts handles the emotional scenes  with maturity.

524196,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXFU,D. Litton,"[2, 4]","&quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; is one of those movies that makes you stand up and cheer. Based on the true story of the real Erin Brockovich's law battle with a major corporation, director Steven Soderbergh and actress Julia Roberts bring the events of the movie to life in an unclich&eacute;d, refreshing discourse that is a delight on the eyes and both humorous and dramatic. Soderbergh handles the material in his usual way, filming it with new and evoking techniques, and Roberts, scantily clad but immensely intelligent, proves to audiences and the world that she has matured since her days in &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; playing the role with in a strikingly serious manner that anchors the rest of the plot.As the story begins, Erin is down on her luck, trying to find a well-paying job to support her three kids. After an auto collision leaves her broke with lawyer's fees, she demands that her lawyer, Ed Masry, give her a job in return for losing her case. As she begins working, she discovers some files that seem out of place, and upon further investigation and interviews with several residents of the small town of Hinkley, she uncovers a major coverup involving a major corporation that could mean a major lawsuit that will bring the small firm down or earn it enough money to make a name for itself.The first thing that must be discussed is the incredible performance from actress Julia Roberts, who brings Erin's character to life in such a way that we find ourselves so moved by her performance as the final credits roll. She brings with her all her old tricks, that sweet charm that makes her one of Hollywood's most valuable stars to date. She is vivacious and and brutal in this role, establishing the fact that Erin is a force to be reckoned with.The movie establishes the many traits of Erin right from the beginning of the film, introducing us to her as someone who is hard-working and willing to earn her keep. Her willingness to work is also a testament to her strong devotion to her children, whom she must support on her own. She is also fiesty and outspoken, as shown during her court debate when she comes under cross-examination: &quot;That a**hole smashed in my f***ing neck!&quot; Erin is strong-willed and a leader in this film, which is a brilliant testament to the real life figure.Erin is also smart and intelligent when it comes to deciphering the many nuances of the case that falls into her lap. From the beginning, when she first senses something is not right, she knows enough to question certain residents of Hinkley about their involvement with Pacific Gas and Electric, and the reasons for their illnesses and diseases. Not taking anything for an answer other than &quot;yes,&quot; she pushes her way through all the barriers to come out on top, all the while surviving the troubles of her own personal life and coming out on top as a real person we can all look up to and admire for their strength and courage.There is a nice bond that develops between Erin and her boss, Ed Masry, who is hesitant to hire her from the beginning. His pity for her, though, clouds his judgement, and he takes her on, soon realizing that he is in over his head with a lawsuit that could mean the end of his career and his financial security. Their many arguments over this and other things concerning the case are intriguing to watch, some adding light moments of comical humor, others advancing the plot to the next level.The human emotion and drama of this story and brought to full view in this film, always keeping with the fact that these are real people who experienced these events. Erin's interaction with these characters, and her devotion to their cause as well as her own is inspiring and ambitious. Soon, her cause becomes nothing but concern for their victory, and Roberts brings this change of events to life. Her reactions to changes in the case, things going wrong, and the way in which her character handles them, are all convincing and authentic, and this keeps us involved with the moving story and the developments at hand.Steven Soderbergh's treatment of this material is brilliant, setting his work high above the mark of good and making this movie one of the best movies of 2000. The way in which he handles Erin's story is one of fluidity and constant plot development, whether it have to do with the lawsuit or with Erin's personal life and her involvement with Ed, who takes care of her children. He is able to combine all of Erin's emotions and balance them against the true story of the people she defends in her pursuit of the truth, which makes us feel for them as well as for the losses she suffers because of her efforts. There are a good deal of shots in the film that give it the look and feel of a typical Soderbergh film, showcasing his use of Steadycam, giving the film a true-to-life perspective which keeps it more involving without putting off the audience.Alongside the star power of Julia Roberts is a brilliant supporting cast that have their own roles and key parts in the film. Albert Finney plays Ed Masry, Erin's boss and friend, who comes to learn the true value of her work as the movie progresses. He and Roberts have a nice workplace chemistry that gives life to the movie's lawsuit plotline, while also keeping it more touching and emotional. Aaron Eckhart plays George, Erin's next door neighbor and boyfriend, who is given a lot of time onscreen to develop into a terrific supporting character. His moments with the children are moving, establishing him as a father figure, while his relationship with Erin is complicated because of her work, bringing them to a crossroads. Their chemistry is convincing and believable, and provides some nice bits of romance for the movie without taking it under.In &quot;Erin Brockovich,&quot; all the stops are pulled out, and history is given a quite refreshing treatment that is humorous, emotionally moving, and involving all in one package of short skirts and high heels. In reality, Julia Roberts is what makes this movie work, bringing her charisma and charm to the movie with the same intensity and credibility she carries in her previous roles. Stand back, because the Pretty Woman has grown up, and she's back with an attitude and a brain to match it.",5,A moving film with a talented cast.,985996800,"03 31, 2001",2001,6272,"['quot', 'Erin',

There's no desperate missions to liberate Nazi art treasures or courtroom custody battles over polio-stricken children.

I watched this movie having already heard the whole plot on the radio, and it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the piece. Julia Roberts is in one of her best roles, making the rather strident character she plays likeable and identifiable with. Albert Finney provides fine support as the gruff American lawyer, and thoroughly deserved is Best Supporting Actor nomination.

524198,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B00003CXFU,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","While viewing the riveting ERIN BROCKOVICH one has to ponder. . .if the REAL Erin is so talented and so intelligent, why couldn't she hold a job?  How did she end up with a string of loser men?  Yet, alas, based on the recent boating adventures that placed Ms. Brockovich in some legal peril, perhaps she's not quite as intelligent as the movie suggests.  But I digress.When we meet Erin Brockovich in the film, she is a bombshell single mom down on her luck--a woman absolutely fearless to wear tight, suggestive--very revealing--outfits.  When her auto injury lawsuit gets thrown out, she bullies her way into a job at the firm of the lawyer who represented her (Albert Finney, a curmudgeon to my liking).  But what's she going to do?  Turns out she's a heck of an investigator, uncovering a cover-up by powerful Pacific Gas & Electric.  The utility giant has been dumping toxic waste near Hinkley, California, and the poison has seeped into the ground water, causing premature death and gruesome disease.  Erin befriends the victims, convincing over 600 of them to file a class action lawsuit, while PG&E; throws up roadblock after roadblock.  There are the (predictable) setbacks, and all the while Erin's personal life is put in serious strain, yet in the end there is a poignant feel good moment, augmented by a fiery Erin getting her long overdue comeuppance once she receives her bonus check from Finney's gloating character.This is my favorite Julia Roberts role (to be honest, there's not much competition); the actress aptly carries the freight the entire story.  Finney more than holds his own, and the chemistry with Roberts is exceptional.  Special kudos to Aaron Eckhart as the free spirit, shaggy, next door neighbor biker who ends up babysitting Erin's three kids on a full-time basis; Eckhart's character is the soothing balm that keeps Erin's life from spinning out of control.  There are some jarring moments with the victims, and this film, as it's based on a true story, will make you angry, yet overall ERIN BROCKOVICH is a win/win:  Justice is served, and it's delivered by a vehicle that's ever so easy on the eye.--D.

I've always found her bland, and her one attempt at off-beat casting &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; was disasterous. But in &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; she has found a character who is not a grinny Girl Scout, but on the other hand seems to fit Ms Roberts' persona. Erin Brockovich is a loose cannon whose worst enemy is her own mouth, but underneath the bluster (not to mention the Frederick's of Fresno wardrobe) is an impulsive woman with a brain and a warm sympathy for others. Ms Roberts handles the role well, using her natural charm and vitality to complete the character. (And I'm sure it helped to have a strong director Steven Soderbergh controlling the  character's in-your-face crusading spirit.) Her co-star is Albert Finney, who is remarkable as Erin's lawyer-boss -- an American, of course. Who would believe that Finney was born in England and attended RADA? (Incidently, that 18th Century stud muffin Tom Jones in unrecognizable here.) They get hefty support, especially from Aaron Eckhart as Erin's boyfriend, a down-to-Earth biker who isn't ashamed to play with kids or wear reading glasses. Marg Helgenberger is touching as a woman whose life is threatened by an irresponsible bureaucracy, and Conchata Farrell is always fun in any small role she plays. As another litigant in the lawsuit Erin is involved in, Cherry Jones has yet to display on screen that wattage that has electrified New York. Susannah Grant's screenplay manages to miss most (though not all) the clich&eacute;s of let's-buck-the-system stories; and the musical score (thank God!) is laid back, avoiding any soaring feel-good excesses. &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; is not a great movie, but it is absorbing and very enjoyable.",4,Erin of Arc,985219200,"03 22, 2001",2001,1791,"['many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'oblivious', 'star', 'power', 'Julia', 'Roberts', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'bland', 'one', 'attempt', 'off-beat', 'casting', 'quot', 'Mary', 'Reilly', 'quot', 'was', 'disasterous', 'quot', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'quot', 'found', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'grinny', 'Girl', 'Scout', 'other', 'hand', 'fit', 'Ms', 'Roberts', 'persona', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'loose', 'cannon', 'worst', 'enemy', 'own', 'mouth', 'bluster', 'not', 'mention', 'Frederick', 'Fresno', 'wardrobe', 'impulsive', 'woman', 'brain', 'warm', 'sympathy', 'others', 'Ms', 'Roberts', 'role', 'well', 'using', 'natural', 'charm', 'vitality', 'complete', 'character', ""'m"", 'sure', 'helped', 'have', 'strong', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'controlling', 'character', 'in-your-face', 'crusading', 'spirit', 'co-star', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'who', 'remarkable', 'Erin', 'lawyer-boss', 'American', 'course', 'Who', 'would', 'believe', 'Finney', 'was', 'born', 'England', 'attended', 'RADA', 'Incidently', '18th', 'Century', 'stud', 'muffin', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'unrecognizable', 'here', 'get', 'hefty', 'support', 'especially', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Erin', 'boyfriend', 'down-to-Earth', 'biker', 'who', ""n't"", 'ashamed', 'play', 'kids', 'wear', 'reading', 'glasses', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'touching', 'woman', 'life', 'threatened', 'irresponsible', 'bureaucracy', 'Conchata', 'Farrell', 'always', 'fun', 'small', 'role', 'litigant', 'lawsuit', 'Erin', 'involved', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'yet', 'display', 'screen', 'wattage', 'electrified', 'New', 'York', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'screenplay', 'miss', 'most', 'not', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', ""let's-buck-the-system"", 'stories', 'musical', 'score', 'thank', 'God', 'laid', 'back', 'avoiding', 'soaring', 'feel-good', 'excesses', 'quot', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'quot', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'absorbing', 'very', 'enjoyable']",Erin Brockovich VHS

Her ability to  relate to these people is the axis on which the impending lawsuit turns;  her ability to weasel her way into her boss's fatherly heart enables her to  continue in a fight many would've deemed hopeless.The humor was  effective throughout, softening me for the emotional scenes--directed with  subtlety by Steven Soderburgh.  The up and down relationship between  George, a neighboring biker, and Brockovich adds depth to her struggles and  emotions.Sure, the movie has a lot of foul language, but it's an honest  depiction of a real woman, and it's hard to imagine her pushing her way to  the top of this dog-heap without just such grittiness.

524219,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXFU,"""flickjunkie""","[76, 85]","Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story.  Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck  mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job.  After having an auto  accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law  firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications.  It seems that  utility giant PG&amp;E has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents  are getting gravely ill.The story starts poorly with scenes of Erin  looking for jobs and botching her accident case.  The first twenty minutes  of the film could have been condensed into five.  However, once the  investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing.  It is a  powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and  smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the  victims.Director Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this  after his extremely avant-garde effort in ""The Limey"".  His key strength  here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert  Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters.  However, my  only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was  presented.  George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left  shoulder says &quot;DIRTY&quot;) who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a  ponytail.  He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and  kind.  All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems  inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this  package.Julia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any  myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.  A far cry from her  accustomed lightweight romantic characters, her portrayal of Brockovich was  gritty, raw and audacious.  Emotionally, she commanded states from  manipulative vamp and vicious harpy to sympathetic confidant and indignant  crusader.  This is unquestionably her best performance and legitimizes her  as one of the more versatile actresses in Hollywood.Albert Finney also  gave a fine performance as the bumbling but effective curmudgeon of a  lawyer.  He was simultaneously obnoxious and charming and created a good  contrast to Roberts' character.  The two of them had terrific  chemistry.Aaron Eckhart was lovable as George, although as mentioned  above, the character's forbearing personality didn't jibe with his  rebellious culture.  However, I put more of the responsibility for this on  the director than on the actor.The DVD has some excellent comments by  the real Erin Brockovich that lend credibility to the story.  However,  Brockovich is so toned down in these interviews, it makes Roberts'  portrayal seem like an exaggeration.This is an excellent story that is  well and believably dramatized.  I rated it an 8/10.  For viewers who enjoy  strong dramatic performances and who are not offended by liberal profanity,  I recommend it highly.",4,Julia Roberts gives a breakout performance,966384000,"08 16, 2000",2000,3007,"['Julia', 'Roberts', 'yet', 'David', 'Goliath', 'struggle', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Roberts', 'down-on-her-luck', 'mother', 'three', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'having', 'auto', 'accident', 'bumpy', 'transition', 'client', 'employee', 'law', 'firm', 'stumbles', 'case', 'staggering', 'implications', 'utility', 'giant', 'PG', 'amp', 'E', 'poisoned', 'groundwater', 'local', 'residents', 'are', 'getting', 'gravely', 'ill.The', 'story', 'poorly', 'scenes', 'Erin', 'looking', 'jobs', 'botching', 'accident', 'case', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'condensed', 'five', 'However', 'once', 'investigation', 'case', 'story', 'engrossing', 'powerful', 'well', 'written', 'human', 'interest', 'drama', 'centered', 'tough', 'smart', 'crude', 'woman', 'who', 'passionate', 'crusade', 'behalf', 'victims.Director', 'Steven', 'Soderberg', 'played', 'straight', 'filming', 'extremely', 'avant-garde', 'effort', 'Limey', 'key', 'strength', 'here', 'was', 'direction', 'actors', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'giving', 'excellent', 'interpretations', 'characters', 'However', 'only', 'negative', 'criticism', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'Erin', 'boyfriend', 'George', 'was', 'presented', 'George', 'grubby', 'tattoo', 'covered', 'biker', 'tattoo', 'left', 'shoulder', 'quot', 'DIRTY', 'quot', 'who', 'Ward', 'Cleaver', 'ponytail', 'genteel', 'articulate', 'level', 'headed', 'patient', 'sensitive', 'kind', 'so', 'disconnected', 'lifestyle', 'inconceivable', 'character', 'wonderful', 'could', 'possibly', 'come', 'package.Julia', 'Roberts', 'gave', 'superlative', 'performance', 'smashed', 'myth', 'inability', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'far', 'cry', 'accustomed', 'lightweight', 'romantic', 'characters', 'portrayal', 'Brockovich', 'was', 'gritty', 'raw', 'audacious', 'Emotionally', 'commanded', 'states', 'manipulative', 'vamp', 'vicious', 'harpy', 'sympathetic', 'confidant', 'indignant', 'crusader', 'unquestionably', 'best', 'performance', 'one', 'more', 'versatile', 'actresses', 'Hollywood.Albert', 'Finney', 'also', 'gave', 'fine', 'performance', 'bumbling', 'effective', 'curmudgeon', 'lawyer', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'obnoxious', 'charming', 'created', 'good', 'contrast', 'Roberts', 'character', 'two', 'had', 'terrific', 'chemistry.Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'was', 'lovable', 'George', 'as', 'mentioned', 'character', 'forbearing', 'personality', 'did', ""n't"", 'jibe', 'rebellious', 'culture', 'However', 'put', 'more', 'responsibility', 'director', 'actor.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'comments', 'real', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'lend', 'credibility', 'story', 'However', 'Brockovich', 'so', 'toned', 'down', 'interviews', 'Roberts', 'portrayal', 'seem', 'exaggeration.This', 'excellent', 'story', 'well', 'believably', 'dramatized', 'rated', '8/10', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'performances', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'offended', 'liberal', 'profanity', 'recommend', 'highly']",Erin Brockovich VHS

Overall, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; is an above average Hollywood flick that suceeds due to two relevant elements: the director Steven Soderbergh and the lead actress Julia Ruberts. Frankly, I have never been a big fan of any of them, but I`ll admit that they make this movie work.Roberts gives a solid and convincing performance, probably her best ever, and proves that she can do better than formulaic romantic comedies. Soderbergh creates a film that is somewhat like many predictable TV-movies, yet he manages to present a couple of details which turn this effort into a peculiar and distinct one (professional and appealing direction, competent character development, a familar story told in an absorbing and gripping perspective).Despite the typical Hollywood ending that certainly won`t surprise anyone, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; is an interesting cinematic experience that doesn`t need to rely on high action, multiple twists or shock-value scenes to offer enough dramatic tension.

More attention should  have been given to Aaron Eckhart, Marg Helgenberger and the all too briefly  seen Cherry Jones.Following on the heels of THE LIMEY and OUT OF  SIGHT, the film represents another step forward on director Steven  Soderbergh's comeback trail as well.

""Erin Brockovich"" is  the perfect film to sweep the Academy Awards if only it was released around  the holidays. It is a touching movie that stays as real to real life as it  can. Similar to real life, the only way to get through the rough spots is  to laugh, and writer Susannah Grant knows this. Even during the film's most  depressing and down moments, humor rises to lighten the mood and entertain  the audience.  Julia Roberts gives her best performance to date as  Erin Brockovich, and she alone makes the movie. Albert Finney gives a  wonderful performance as well as Ed Masry, the boss who hates to love Erin.  His performances definitely deserve a nod come Oscar time, while Roberts  deserves not only a nod, but the gold.  Based on a true story, ""Erin  Brockovich"" is the story of a desperate single mom who takes a job in a law  firm to help put food on the table for her kids. What she ends up  discovering though are connections between a power company's abuse of toxic  chromium and the sick town locals who have been drinking the poisoned water  supply.

524243,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00003CXFU,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Strong, emotional, at times pathetic, this film will let you enjoy a real case in its Hollywood rendering. The theme is not new, especially in the US where these disputes about the pollution created by industrial businesses end up all the time in front of a judge. The active woman who is going to fight for that case has three kids, has been married twice and she got divorced twice too. She is fighting for her independence and a motivation in her life in general and professional life in particular. The case is simple: an industrial factory pollutes the soil of a whole residential zone, knows it and hides it to the residents and even lies to them. That Erin Brokovich is doing the only work that can win a case like that: she canvasses all the people who have a reason to claim some damage. She gets them all to sign the document to go in front of a judge. In spite of not liking the procedure chosen by the new experienced associate of the firm she goes along with it and even finds a direct witness of the misbehavior of the business and of its concealing methods. That witness has even stolen some documents that he was supposed to destroy. That will bring an unexpectedly high result and Erin will get a nice check in the end. But Julia Roberts is excellent because she embodies a pugnacious lady that is both stubborn and effective, charming at times and uncompromising when necessary. She manages to win the heart of her son over, though he is young, the understanding and support of her third boyfriend who is going to be the third husband one day, and of course the case more than anything else. There is no real suspense in the film but the impersonation of Erin Brokovich by Julia Roberts is the real charm of the story.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,That's how the world can improve,1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,1870,"['Strong', 'emotional', 'times', 'pathetic', 'film', 'will', 'let', 'enjoy', 'real', 'case', 'Hollywood', 'rendering', 'theme', 'not', 'new', 'especially', 'US', 'where', 'disputes', 'pollution', 'created', 'industrial', 'businesses', 'end', 'up', 'time', 'front', 'judge', 'active', 'woman', 'who', 'going', 'fight', 'case', 'three', 'kids', 'been', 'married', 'twice', 'got', 'divorced', 'twice', 'too', 'fighting', 'independence', 'motivation', 'life', 'general', 'professional', 'life', 'particular', 'case', 'simple', 'industrial', 'factory', 'soil', 'whole', 'residential', 'zone', 'residents', 'even', 'lies', 'Erin', 'Brokovich', 'doing', 'only', 'work', 'can', 'win', 'case', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'reason', 'claim', 'damage', 'sign', 'document', 'go', 'front', 'judge', 'spite', 'not', 'liking', 'procedure', 'chosen', 'new', 'experienced', 'associate', 'firm', 'along', 'even', 'direct', 'witness', 'misbehavior', 'business', 'concealing', 'methods', 'witness', 'even', 'stolen', 'documents', 'was', 'supposed', 'destroy', 'will', 'bring', 'unexpectedly', 'high', 'result', 'Erin', 'will', 'get', 'nice', 'check', 'end', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'excellent', 'pugnacious', 'lady', 'stubborn', 'effective', 'charming', 'times', 'uncompromising', 'when', 'necessary', 'win', 'heart', 'son', 'young', 'understanding', 'support', 'third', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'third', 'husband', 'one', 'day', 'course', 'case', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'real', 'suspense', 'film', 'impersonation', 'Erin', 'Brokovich', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'real', 'charm', 'story.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",Erin Brockovich VHS

Julia Roberts, in one of her freshest performances, is Erin Brockovich, a  single mother with three kids, out of work, with little education or  experience. She gets a job as gofer in a law firm headed by Ed Masry  wonderfully played by Albert Finney (Millers Crossing). Based on a true  story with a real life Erin Brockovich, it's a tale of David versus  Goliath. Watching the essentially conservative Julia Roberts playing  against herself with short skirts, push-up bras and stiletto heels and then  watching her character playing against the long suffering Ed Masry is very  entertaining. Aaron Eckhart (Any Given Sunday) gives a nice, complex  performance as Erin's helpful neighbor; Marge Helgenberger (K.C. of ABC's  China Beach) plays Donna Jensen, a touching victim who becomes a plaintiff.

And, quite honestly, it's fun to watch her do it.Brockovich (Julia Roberts, Oscar-winner for this role) has three kids, two ex-es, and a realy foul mouth. When she lands a job at the law office of Ed Masry (Albert Finney, Oscar-nominee for this role), she finds herself initiating the investigaiton of a local power plant, which has apparently contaminated the water of a small town nearby and caused numerous illness and deaths. Erin keeps pushing Ed and the townspeople, and ends up being a participant in a 333 million-dollar lawsuit, one of the biggest in American history.Besides a heartwarming David-and-Golliath story, this is essentially a star vehicle for the winning Julia Roberts, as well as an ego trip for the real-life Erin Brockovich (who gained MUCH publicity... after the release of the film). The film is not perfect: it sometimes lacks a sense of coherence (one scene ends and the next begins without flow), and some performances are mediocre. However, Roberts finally frees herself from her previous stereotype of the candy-colored heroine and Finney is wonderful as usual, and also noted is a quite moving supporting performance by TV-veteran Marg Helgenberger, who plays Donna Jensen, a victim of the contaminated water due to the power plant's carelessness. Her performance, above all, makes you glad that the good guys win.",4,"Great entertainment, even if it is predictable.",1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,1473,"['Erin', 'Brockovich', 'real', 'woman', 'real', 'problems', 'real', 'will', 'do', 'something', 'good', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'Something', 'good', 'quite', 'honestly', 'fun', 'watch', 'do', 'it.Brockovich', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Oscar-winner', 'role', 'three', 'kids', 'two', 'ex-es', 'realy', 'foul', 'mouth', 'When', 'job', 'law', 'office', 'Ed', 'Masry', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Oscar-nominee', 'role', 'initiating', 'investigaiton', 'local', 'power', 'plant', 'apparently', 'contaminated', 'water', 'small', 'town', 'nearby', 'caused', 'numerous', 'illness', 'deaths', 'Erin', 'pushing', 'Ed', 'townspeople', 'up', 'being', 'participant', '333', 'million-dollar', 'lawsuit', 'one', 'biggest', 'American', 'heartwarming', 'David-and-Golliath', 'story', 'essentially', 'star', 'vehicle', 'winning', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'as', 'well', 'ego', 'trip', 'real-life', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'who', 'gained', 'MUCH', 'publicity', 'release', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'sometimes', 'sense', 'coherence', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'flow', 'performances', 'are', 'mediocre', 'However', 'Roberts', 'finally', 'previous', 'stereotype', 'candy-colored', 'heroine', 'Finney', 'wonderful', 'usual', 'also', 'noted', 'quite', 'moving', 'supporting', 'performance', 'TV-veteran', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'who', 'Donna', 'Jensen', 'victim', 'contaminated', 'water', 'due', 'power', 'plant', 'carelessness', 'performance', 'glad', 'good', 'guys', 'win']",Erin Brockovich VHS

Daniel,"[0, 0]","I think that almost everyone is familiar with this film version of how Erin Brokovitch took on a large corporation that had knowingly polluted the water supply of a small town, and through their intentional cover-up had adversely affected the health of almost everyone in that town. This is a true life David and Goliath story. Only, in this case, &quot;David's&quot; weapons were chutzpa, perseverance, cleavage, and a big dose of commitment to something she believed in, instead of a sling and a stone.Brockovich was no dummy. To the contrary, as portrayed by Julia Roberts, (one of my favorite actresses!) she was bright, articulate (if a little earthy), and always aware of her impact on people. She had a natural empathy that people could feel. Consequently they liked her and responded to her. This applies, from what I've read, to the real life Brockovich, and certainly to the screen Brockovich. Julia Roberts' manner of dressing was, if anything, toned down a bit from that of the real life Erin Brockovich. For those who found Roberts' attire distracting, I wonder how you would have responded to the real Erin.Albert Finney played her boss, a moderately successful &quot;shirt-sleeve&quot; attorney who had a lot to lose if the lawsuit went awry. He gave this role just the right blend of wit, concern, fear, anger, and elation. He's the attorney that we'd all like to find.I found this movie to be entertaining, well acted, satisfying, and one that I can watch and watch with feeling so happy at the end.

I usually don't write reviews on DVD's/Movies unless they are typical guy movies, war movies, etc.  However, I had to make an exception for this wonderful, outstanding acted movie.Julia Roberts portrays true life Erin Brockovich.  A lady who came from a not so glamerous background who with the help of the law firm she worked for took on big and powerful Pacific Gas And Electric (PG&amp;E) and won a huge settlement for the townspeople of Hinckly, California.  This is a true life case where PG&amp;E used Hazardous Chemicals in their electric turbines and took the waste from the turbines (Chronium) and instead of safely containing them in lined waste ponds, decided not to make the ponds safe and thus the Chronium seaped into the ground soil and contaminating the town's water supply.Erin Brockovich (Roberts Character), needed a job desperately and was able to work for a law firm who had the case &quot;pro bono&quot;.  THANK Goodness for the law firm and Hinckly that Brockovich worked for the lawyers (even though she isn't a lawyer).Overcoming a tremendous burden (single mom, low paying salary), Brockovich researched the cases, got to know the townspeople, gathered evidence, and to make a long story short, won for the &quot;little people&quot;, over 300 Million Dollars!!This is a movie that everyone would enjoy.  Roberts rightfully won the Oscar for Best Actress from this movie.  All actors/actresses in this movie did an excellent job.

Her acting talents to me have always seemed pretty run of the mill.  And she can occasionally appear to be stunningly beautiful at most times she appears remarkably average.  So i've never understood the hypeWe are treated here to an extraordinary performance.  She brings genuine honesty to the role.  I would highly recommend that you read the review of 'RESOLUTE' which I found to be particularly poignant and accurate.  To RESOLUTE: I wish that you would include your email and that you would write more reviews because you really seem to know your stuff ie: Independence DayWhat I enjoyed most about this film is that the story and the performances carried the day rather than production tricks and hype.

524259,AK81WLVD5KGUX,B00003CXFU,"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan""","[12, 16]","It's sure hard to find any opinions about this movie that aren't knee-jerk. On the one hand, the movie and its hero are attacked by people who don't seem to think corporations can do any wrong. On the other, it's defended by people who seem to think having a Good Heart is all that's necessary to Defend The Environment and the Public Health.Well, the true story involves _both_ junk science _and_ sleazy corporate practices. And whether or not the &quot;science&quot; in the movie is defended by actual scientists (which it isn't), Erin Brockovich was and is a hero.One hard fact is that hexavalent chromium probably wasn't responsible for all the injuries attributed to it in this film. Yes, it's a carcinogen and it's dangerous when inhaled. But so far as I know, there's no evidence linking it to all the problems detailed in this movie when it's ingested as part of the drinking-water supply. (Not that I'd want to risk it myself, mind you.)But another, and equally important, hard fact is that Pacific Gas and Electric _did_ screw up big-time. The company knew Cr(VI) was a health hazard, _didn't_ know exactly what the risks were (at that time nobody did -- in fact we still don't), failed to take obvious (and, for better or worse, EPA-mandated) precautions against polluting the local groundwater with the stuff, and then lied to everybody about everything. They were not heroes, and Brockovich did uncover their wrongdoing.Brockovich, as I said, was and is a hero, and she is well portrayed in this film. I am not ordinarily a fan of Julia Roberts (in fact, frankly, I haven't liked her in anything but _Steel Magnolias_). But she does a nice job here.The movie, while (I'm told) varying in places from the facts of the actual story, manages to avoid falling into at least _some_ obvious cliches. Far, for example, from portraying a triumph of the &quot;little guy&quot; over the big corporate baddies, the film makes clear that the law firm for which Brockovich works _could not have won_ without the aid of a big-corporate-baddie lawyer (Peter Coyote) with both money and toxic-torts experience.Brockovich doesn't much like this, but it's one of several points on which her knee-jerk, legally inexperienced judgment is simply shown to be wrong. Another is in her initial opposition to binding arbitration, a point handled nicely by Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who is marvelous throughout). And there's another cliche successfully avoided: refreshingly, the fact that Brockovich's &quot;heart is in the right place&quot; doesn't magically make her an expert who out-lawyers the lawyers at every turn.It's probably impossible to avoid comparing this film to _A Civil Action_, which involves a somewhat similar set of facts. But unlike that other movie (which heavily fictionalized Jan Schlichtmann in any event), at bottom this is a character study of Brockovich herself. And, presented &quot;warts and all,&quot; she is much more interesting than ideologues in _either_ camp would like to allow.She is most assuredly a very refreshing movie hero. Sassy, foul-mouthed, and occasionally downright mean (watch, e.g., her nasty comments to Conchatta Ferrell's character), she is also hard-working, (mostly) responsible, and hungry for justice. No cardboard cutout, she's a complicated person with genuine flaws, and Roberts plays her as such.The real fun is in watching her learn to put her &quot;flaws&quot; to work on the side of the good guys. It's a joy to watch her win -- against the usual Hollywood gang of weaselly attorneys (including a condescending Miss Priss who has a hard time believing Brockovich has anything on the ball at all), against PG&amp;E itself, and against the shortcomings that have thus far kept her from success. It's impossible not to like her and root for her.A satisfying film overall, then (and one that incidentally succeeds in many respects in which the heavy-handed and absolutely pathetic _Pay It Forward_ fails utterly). Many reviewers will probably disagree with me here, but I hope Julia Roberts never goes back to romantic comedies.",4,Not just another legal thriller (_or_ Julia Roberts vehicle),994291200,"07 5, 2001",2001,4077,"['sure', 'hard', 'find', 'opinions', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'knee-jerk', 'one', 'hand', 'movie', 'hero', 'are', 'attacked', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'think', 'corporations', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'other', 'defended', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'think', 'having', 'Good', 'Heart', 'necessary', 'Defend', 'Environment', 'Public', 'Health.Well', 'true', 'story', '_both_', 'junk', 'science', '_and_', 'sleazy', 'corporate', 'practices', 'not', 'quot', 'science', 'quot', 'movie', 'defended', 'actual', 'scientists', ""n't"", 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'was', 'hero.One', 'hard', 'fact', 'hexavalent', 'chromium', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'responsible', 'injuries', 'attributed', 'film', 'Yes', 'carcinogen', 'dangerous', 'when', 'inhaled', 'so', 'far', 'know', 'evidence', 'linking', 'problems', 'detailed', 'movie', 'when', 'ingested', 'part', 'drinking-water', 'supply', 'Not', ""'d"", 'want', 'risk', 'mind', 'equally', 'important', 'hard', 'fact', 'Pacific', 'Gas', 'Electric', '_did_', 'screw', 'up', 'big-time', 'company', 'knew', 'Cr', 'VI', 'was', 'health', 'hazard', ""_didn't_"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'risks', 'were', 'time', 'nobody', 'did', 'fact', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'failed', 'take', 'obvious', 'better', 'worse', 'EPA-mandated', 'precautions', 'polluting', 'local', 'groundwater', 'stuff', 'then', 'lied', 'everybody', 'everything', 'were', 'not', 'heroes', 'Brockovich', 'did', 'uncover', 'wrongdoing.Brockovich', 'said', 'was', 'hero', 'well', 'portrayed', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'ordinarily', 'fan', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'fact', 'frankly', 'have', ""n't"", 'liked', 'anything', '_Steel', 'Magnolias_', 'nice', 'job', 'here.The', 'movie', ""'m"", 'told', 'varying', 'places', 'facts', 'actual', 'story', 'avoid', 'falling', 'least', '_some_', 'obvious', 'cliches', 'Far', 'example', 'portraying', 'triumph', 'quot', 'little', 'guy', 'quot', 'big', 'corporate', 'baddies', 'film', 'clear', 'law', 'firm', 'Brockovich', '_could', 'not', 'have', 'won_', 'aid', 'big-corporate-baddie', 'lawyer', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'money', 'toxic-torts', 'experience.Brockovich', ""n't"", 'much', 'one', 'several', 'points', 'knee-jerk', 'legally', 'inexperienced', 'judgment', 'simply', 'shown', 'be', 'wrong', 'initial', 'opposition', 'binding', 'arbitration', 'point', 'handled', 'nicely', 'Ed', 'Masry', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'who', 'marvelous', 'cliche', 'successfully', 'avoided', 'refreshingly', 'fact', 'Brockovich', 'quot', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'quot', ""n't"", 'magically', 'make', 'expert', 'who', 'lawyers', 'turn.It', 'probably', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'comparing', 'film', '_A', 'Civil', 'Action_', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'set', 'facts', 'other', 'movie', 'heavily', 'fictionalized', 'Jan', 'Schlichtmann', 'event', 'bottom', 'character', 'study', 'Brockovich', 'presented', 'quot', 'warts', 'quot', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'ideologues', '_either_', 'camp', 'would', 'like', 'allow.She', 'most', 'assuredly', 'very', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'hero', 'Sassy', 'foul-mouthed', 'occasionally', 'downright', 'mean', 'watch', 'e.g.', 'nasty', 'comments', 'Conchatta', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'also', 'hard-working', 'mostly', 'responsible', 'hungry', 'justice', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'complicated', 'person', 'genuine', 'flaws', 'Roberts', 'such.The', 'real', 'fun', 'watching', 'learn', 'put', 'quot', 'quot', 'work', 'side', 'good', 'guys', 'joy', 'watch', 'win', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'gang', 'weaselly', 'attorneys', 'including', 'condescending', 'Miss', 'Priss', 'who', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'Brockovich', 'anything', 'ball', 'PG', 'amp', 'E', 'shortcomings', 'have', 'thus', 'far', 'kept', 'success', 'impossible', 'not', 'like', 'root', 'her.A', 'satisfying', 'film', 'overall', 'then', 'one', 'incidentally', 'many', 'respects', 'heavy-handed', 'absolutely', 'pathetic', '_Pay', 'Forward_', 'utterly', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'will', 'probably', 'disagree', 'here', 'hope', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'never', 'back', 'romantic', 'comedies']",Erin Brockovich VHS

Mostly with names like Erin Brockovich or Joan of Arc, you'd expect there was going to be some kind of war hero who dies in the end and has never been noticed before. But, in Erin Brockovich, it focuses on a classy new kind of hero that brings a small town to it's feet and huge business to it's knees.Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an unemployed single mother desperate find a job but is having no luck. This losing streak even extends to a failed lawsuit against a doctor in a car accident she was in. With no alternative, she successfully browbeats her lawyer to give her a job in compensation for the loss. While no one takes her seriously with her trashy clothes and earthy manners, that soon changes when she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.. What she discovers is that the company is trying to quietly to buy land that was contaminated by hexavalent chromium, a deadly toxic waste that the company is improperly and illegally dumping and in turn poisoning the residents in the area. As she digs deeper, Erin finds herself leading point in a series of events that would involve her lawfirm in one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against a multi-billion dollar corporationIn Erin Brockovich, you can no longer expect the romantic-comedy type of Julia Roberts. Here, she shines in her role as Erin, a feisty and determined single mom with a plan. It's the first movie in which Roberts really deserves the `career-best' nod, and it will be a movie that she will be remembered for in the future. She is well supported by Albert Finney who handles Ed Masry's anger and happiness perfectly. There is also Aaron Eckhart, who stars as Erin's love interest, to keep us occupied and he is cast nicely and has promise for future roles.

The rest of the cast, likewise, give excellent performances.The story is a compelling one. A down and out single mother of three young children, Erin Brockovich, gets into an auto accident. Her personal injury suit goes down the tubes, when she alienates the jury with her checkered past and salty language. Angry and desperate, she bullies her lawyer, Ed Masry, disarmingly played by Albert Finney, into hiring her, after he loses her personal injury case. He does so, to the consternation of his other employees. You see, Erin marches to the beat of a different drummer. She dresses like a tramp and talks like a longshoreman.Which only goes to show you, that one should never judge a book by its cover. Beneath the vulgar exterior, lies a steel trap mind, which Erin put to good use when she goes through a pro bono real estate case, only to discover that there is more to the real estate transaction than meets the eye, a whole lot more. Intrigued by the fact that extensive medical records are included in the real estate transaction paperwork and wondering why that should be, Erin lets her natural curiosity and interest in people prevail. She goes about and investigates the matter.What she ultimately discovers is that toxic waste is very clearly affecting the quality of life of the inhabitants of the town of Hinckley, California. It appears that the utilities giant Pacific Gas and Electric has been letting highly toxic chromium seep into the ground, affecting the water which the inhabitants of the town use. The utilities giant has compounded the problem by telling the townspeople that they should not worry about a little chromium, despite the high incidence of cancer and other illnesses which abound in Hinckley.Erin, outraged on behalf of the townspeople, discovers through her research and investigation that Pacific Gas and Electric knew about the toxicity of the Chromium, but continued with business as usual and set about deceiving the unsuspecting townspeople to their ultimate detriment. Eager to right a serious wrong, Erin persuades her employer, small time lawyer, Ed Masry, to take on this big time case. This ultimately leads to one of the largest monetary class action settlements in history.This is a true life David and Goliath story. Julia Roberts gives a sassy and brassy performance. Albert Finney does his part justice, as the beleagured small practitioner who decides to do the right thing, even though it could end to his detriment. His low key performance is a perfect foil to that of Julia Roberts'.

This is a  true life David and Goliath story.  Only, in this case, &quot;David's&quot;  weapons were chutzpa, perseverance, cleavage, and a big dose of commitment  to something she believed in, instead of a sling and a stone.Brokovitch  was no dummy.  To the contrary, as portrayed by Julie Roberts, she was  bright, articulate (if a little earthy), and always aware of her impact on  people.  She had a natural empathy that people could feel.  Consequently  they liked her and responded to her.  This applies, from what I've read, to  the real life Brokovitch, and certainly to the screen Brokovitch.  I also  understand that Julie Roberts' manner of dressing was, if anything, toned  down a bit from that of the real life Erin Brokovitch.  For those who found  Roberts' attire distracting, I wonder how you would have responded to the  real Erin.Albert Finney played her boss, a moderately successful  &quot;shirt-sleeve&quot; attorney who had a lot to lose if the lawsuit went  awry.  He gave this role just the right blend of wit, concern, fear, anger,  and elation.

But everything was very well done.  All the characters were good.  One bad thing is that they seem to have cut some scenes out to speed it up?  Some of the scene transitions were downright bizarre and there was no logic behind.  But other than that, no real complaints.One thing I'd like to point out to people before they watch this is that Erin Brockovich is not a very likable person.

524284,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00003CXFU,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[3, 5]","Julia Roberts is like the vanilla ice cream of movies. Everyone pretty much likes her more or less, and for a dessert, she'll do in a pinch.And I don't mean that literally.Of course, vanilla ice cream isn't really all that memorable, and, I'll admit, there are a few memorable Roberts moments. But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts: she is the same in every movie.There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way. If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots. But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore. Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film.Don't get me wrong. It's entertaining. But it's formulaic. A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot. The story: Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm. Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car. This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way.They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man. Hip hip hooray!I didn't ruin the movie for you. It's not a surprise. This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on. Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality. Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre.With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges. Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone.Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe. Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib. Erin serves it up piping hot.And she won't take none of your lip, neither.",3,Goes Down Like Water,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,2757,"['Julia', 'Roberts', 'vanilla', 'ice', 'cream', 'movies', 'Everyone', 'pretty', 'much', 'more', 'less', 'dessert', ""'ll"", 'do', 'pinch.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'literally.Of', 'course', 'vanilla', 'ice', 'cream', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'memorable', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'are', 'few', 'memorable', 'Roberts', 'moments', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'think', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'Ms.', 'Roberts', 'same', 'are', 'many', 'subtle', 'variations', ""'ll"", 'give', 'when', 'boil', 'down', 'essential', 'elements', 'Julia', 'performances', 'coast', 'few', 'melancholy', 'looks', 'few', 'shy', 'smiles', 'lower', 'lip', 'cutest', 'way', 'think', 'movies', 'Julia', 'shined', 'are', 'typically', 'films', 'intense', 'plots', 'when', 'stop', 'imagine', 'more', 'shallow', 'films', 'parallels', 'are', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'latest', 'film', 'Erin', 'Brockovitch', 'such', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'entertaining', 'formulaic', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'made', 'cookie-cutter', 'plot', 'story', 'Julia', 'brash', 'young', 'unwed', 'mother', 'three', 'Erin', 'Brockovitch', 'who', 'score', 'job', 'filing', 'forms', 'small-time', 'law', 'firm', 'Erin', 'take-no-sass', 'attitude', 'foul-mouthed', 'pluckiness', 'soon', 'take', 'far', 'up', 'raise', 'new', 'car', 'woman', 'traditional', 'schooling', 'few', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'manages', 'bring', 'together', '600+', 'members', 'big', 'chemical', 'scandal', 'memorize', 'families', 'diseases', 'phone', 'numbers', 'life', 'histories', 'no-nonsense', 'down-to-earth', 'sassy', 'way.They', 'win', 'lawsuit', 'big', 'mean', 'corporation', 'pay', 'up', '300+', 'million', 'dollars', 'working', 'man', 'Hip', 'hip', 'hooray', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'not', 'surprise', 'movie', 'same', 'emotive', 'capacities', 'based-on-a-true-story', 'enterprises', 'bank', 'basic', 'story', 'only', 'interesting', 'something', 'bounce', 'Erin', 'personality', 'Which', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'call', 'good', 'theatre.With', 'storyline', 'about', 'much', 'subtlety', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'movie', 'Erin', 'Brockovitch', 'basic', 'accomplishments', 'fall', 'same', 'vein', 'Stooges', 'Just', 'one', 'ever', 'watched', 'Curly', 'see', 'well-constructed', 'plot', 'so', 'Erin', 'Brockovitch', 'exploits', 'become', 'excuse', 'just', 'watch', 'act', 'tough', 'in-your-face', 'everyone.Vanilla', ""n't"", 'best', 'flavor', 'true', 'fail', 'safe', 'Likewise', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Erin', 'Brockovitch', 'anybody', 'uncompromising', 'discriminating', 'tastes', 'anyone', 'looking', 'basic', 'well-commercialized', 'entertainment', 'prepackaged', 'humor', 'should', 'come', 'spoon', 'bib', 'Erin', 'up', 'piping', 'hot.And', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'none', 'lip']",Erin Brockovich VHS

524287,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXFU,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","It is often hard for a movie about a landmark legal battle to capture the public's interest, especially if it is based on a true story. Examples include A Civil Action in 1998 and The Insider in 1999. Despite much critical praise, these movies were apparently perceived by audiences as being too dry. Such was not the fate of Erin Brockovich, which became the first smash hit of 2000. Perhaps having Julia Roberts as the title character fighting for justice helped make the difference. I know it didn't hurt.The picture opens with Erin desperately looking for a job. She's twice divorced from no good husbands and has a child to support. After one interview, she is injured in a car wreck when another driver runs a red light. She decides to sue the other person, not because she is greedy, but because she needs to be compensated for her medical expenses. She turns to a lawyer named Ed Masry [Albert Finney], a very busy man who virtually assures her that she will win. Ed does not factor in Erin's flashy, almost trashy taste in clothing or her tendency to spew out four letter words when she is angered. Her appearance on the witness stand is a disaster, and they lose the case, which brings forth a tirade on the lawyer from Erin. Meanwhile, she meets a decent guy who winds up frightening her. She has had such rotten luck with men. In an ironic turn of events, she ends up working for Ed Masry. The other women in the office are pretty hostile, since Julia's style is hardly what we expect in a staid law office. Erin persists, and one day she discovers a case that has been on the office's back burner. It involves a group of people who live adjacent to one of Pacific Gas and Electric's plants. There is a probability that these people have been poisoned for years by chromium the company has allowed to seep into the local drinking water.There are several things which make the movie work. Much of it concentrates on two very interesting characters, Erin and Ed, rather than on the workings of the legal system itself. It also plots the progress of a remarkable woman. Erin starts off as an intelligent woman with vitally no marketable skills. Also lacking any skills at dealing with other people, she seems destined to be someone who works a lifetime just to eke out a living. For some inner reason, this legal case mesmerizes her. It requires her to learn a whole lot very fast and to put her personal life aside for a cause worth fighting for. In the process, we watch as a whole new woman emerges. Her progress is at least as interesting as the legal battle's.Julia Roberts and the great British actor, Albert Finney, are splendid as Erin and Ed. The way they play off of each other reminds me of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. There is no sex involved, but this is decidedly a battle of the sexes. She's too brash and outspoken for him, and he's too stuffy and cautious for her. It is a case of opposites attracting. As for the movie itself, it's a case of a job well done.",5,"Well crafted, energized crowd pleaser",1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2994,"['often', 'hard', 'movie', 'landmark', 'legal', 'battle', 'capture', 'public', 'interest', 'especially', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Examples', 'include', 'A', 'Civil', 'Action', '1998', 'Insider', '1999', 'much', 'critical', 'praise', 'movies', 'were', 'apparently', 'perceived', 'audiences', 'being', 'too', 'dry', 'Such', 'was', 'not', 'fate', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'became', 'first', 'smash', 'hit', '2000', 'Perhaps', 'having', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'title', 'character', 'fighting', 'justice', 'helped', 'make', 'difference', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt.The', 'picture', 'Erin', 'desperately', 'looking', 'job', 'twice', 'divorced', 'good', 'husbands', 'child', 'support', 'one', 'interview', 'injured', 'car', 'wreck', 'when', 'driver', 'red', 'light', 'sue', 'other', 'person', 'not', 'greedy', 'be', 'compensated', 'medical', 'expenses', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Ed', 'Masry', '[', 'Albert', 'Finney', ']', 'very', 'busy', 'man', 'who', 'virtually', 'will', 'win', 'Ed', 'not', 'factor', 'Erin', 'flashy', 'almost', 'trashy', 'taste', 'clothing', 'tendency', 'spew', 'out', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'when', 'angered', 'appearance', 'witness', 'stand', 'disaster', 'lose', 'case', 'forth', 'tirade', 'lawyer', 'Erin', 'Meanwhile', 'decent', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'frightening', 'had', 'such', 'rotten', 'luck', 'men', 'ironic', 'turn', 'events', 'up', 'working', 'Ed', 'Masry', 'other', 'women', 'office', 'are', 'pretty', 'hostile', 'Julia', 'style', 'hardly', 'what', 'expect', 'staid', 'law', 'office', 'Erin', 'one', 'day', 'case', 'been', 'office', 'back', 'burner', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'adjacent', 'one', 'Pacific', 'Gas', 'Electric', 'plants', 'probability', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'poisoned', 'years', 'chromium', 'company', 'allowed', 'seep', 'local', 'drinking', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'Much', 'two', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Erin', 'Ed', 'rather', 'workings', 'legal', 'system', 'also', 'progress', 'remarkable', 'woman', 'Erin', 'off', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'vitally', 'marketable', 'skills', 'Also', 'lacking', 'skills', 'dealing', 'other', 'people', 'destined', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'lifetime', 'just', 'eke', 'out', 'living', 'inner', 'reason', 'legal', 'case', 'learn', 'whole', 'lot', 'very', 'fast', 'put', 'personal', 'life', 'aside', 'cause', 'worth', 'fighting', 'process', 'watch', 'whole', 'new', 'woman', 'progress', 'least', 'as', 'interesting', 'legal', ""battle's.Julia"", 'Roberts', 'great', 'British', 'actor', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'are', 'splendid', 'Erin', 'Ed', 'way', 'play', 'other', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'sex', 'involved', 'decidedly', 'battle', 'sexes', 'too', 'brash', 'outspoken', 'too', 'stuffy', 'cautious', 'case', 'opposites', 'attracting', 'movie', 'case', 'job', 'well', 'done']",Erin Brockovich VHS
524288,A15TMW8RWR54UF,B00003CXFU,"M. Clemmensen ""Mary""","[7, 17]","Even though I would agree that ""Erin Brockovich"" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in ""Pretty Woman.""  I am second to no one in enjoying a good ""David and Goliath"" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the ""true"" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the ""Xena"" character is the main attraction in ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in ""Pretty Woman"" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.  Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.  Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E; had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E; (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired ""work clothes"" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The ""convenience"" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar ""bonus"" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a ""thanks"" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.

This isn't one of my favourite Julia Roberts movies, but it's an OK one. OK, sure, some people talk about her big mouth, and she works it out quite a bit. But we have to give a big hand to Wonderbra - they worked wonders on Julia!This film gets bogged down by a lot of jargon about the world that Julia's character works in.

524291,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00003CXFU,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 2]","The 2000 film ""Erin Brockovich"" is named for the woman whom this true-life story is about.  Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) was an unemployed, poorly educated, single, twice-divorced mother of 3 young children trying to find work to make ends meet.  Following a car accident, her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), was unable to win her lawsuit against the other driver in part due to Erin's irascible and antagonistic demeanor.  Frustrated, Erin storms into Ed's office following the trial and demands a job from him.  He reluctantly hires her and sets her to work on a seemingly simple real-estate deal, but the deal is anything but simple as medical records of the involved homeowners are included in the file.  As Erin investigates, she meets the homeowners, Pete and Donna Jensen (Michael Harney and Marg Helgenberger respectively), who have been repeatedly sick for a long time, as well as their children.  The potential buyer is not an individual, but a major corporation that has an industrial plant very close to the couple's home.  Erin's investigation leads her to some potentially damaging information about the corporation's doings near the Jensen's home that has also affected many more people within the immediate area.Though the story about sick homeowners and corporate doings is powerful and thought provoking, the time in the film devoted to Erin's homelife is far less compelling in part because of Julia Roberts' acting.  Julia Roberts earned the Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Erin Brockovich, but that was probably due more to the politics surrounding the film rather than the quality of actual acting.  The film was also nominated for four other Oscars including Best Supporting Actor (Albert Finney), Best Director (Steven Soderbergh), Best Picture and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  Other notable actors in the film include Aaron Eckhart as Erin's unemployed biker boyfriend George and the real Erin Brockovich doing a cameo as a waitress.Overall, for its engaging story about sickened residents in a small community but less than stellar acting, I rate ""Erin Brockovich"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  If you have never seen the film, I highly recommend seeing it at least once.",4,"""I hate lawyers.

524292,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00003CXFU,Michael Butts,"[1, 1]","What makes Julia Roberts' Oscar winning performance as Erin Brockovich so meaningful is that unlike fellow winners Charlize Theron (Monster); Nicole Kidman (The Hours); and Halle Berry (Monster's Ball), Roberts didn't hide behind makeup or non-glamor to win her trophy.  She utilizes her physical attributes and then some in playing the scrappy, but somewhat tawdry, young woman who brings down a corporate giant.  Roberts is brilliant in the role and shows a wider range than ever before.  She is backed by a wonderful supporting cast including the marvelous Albert Finney as her lawyer boss and friend; Aaron Eckhart as the biker boyfriend who feels cheated in the relationship; Marg Helgenberger as the cancer-stricken client that starts the ball rolling; and Conchata Ferrell as the ""krispy kreme"" office worker who she spars with.

524293,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00003CXFU,Michael J. Mazza,"[0, 0]","&quot;Erin Brockovich,&quot; directed by Steven Soderbergh, is based on the real-life story of the title character, played in the film by Julia Roberts. Brockovich, a feisty legal clerk, is instrumental in exposing the misdeeds of a powerful corporation which has exposed families to disease-causing industrial residue. As Brockovich and her grouchy-but-loveable boss (wonderfully played by Albert Finney) take on the corporation, the viewer is treated to a rousing &quot;David versus Goliath&quot; story.At the heart of this film's success is the sizzling (but entirely non-sexual) chemistry between Roberts and Finney. They bring great passion and intelligence to their roles, and when they are together, the energy is amazing. Also noteworthy is the fact that although this is a serious drama, the witty script (written by Susannah Grant) is also full of humor. In fact, many of the best scenes from &quot;Erin&quot; are firmly in the great tradition of the workplace comedy. Both Roberts and Finney thus deliver not only excellent dramatic performances, but also great comic performances.The supporting cast is also outstanding. Marg Helgenbeger is particularly affecting as one of the victims of corporate greed and dishonesty.Julia Roberts won a pile of awards (among them her first Oscar) for &quot;Erin,&quot; and I do believe that she deserved the accolades. But &quot;Erin&quot; is not all about Julia.

524294,A3IB1W0SVED0Z3,B00003CXFU,"Mike Powers ""mkp51""","[13, 15]","&quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; is a wonderful movie! Starring Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, and Aaron Eckhart, it's based on the real-life story of Erin Brockovich, a down-on-her-luck, twice divorced former beauty queen with three young children. Having no post-high school education and few job skills, she has great difficulty finding and holding down a job. Despite her adversities, she displays a fierce grit and determination as she constantly seeks ways to support her family.Then a seemingly tragic twist of fate puts her on the road to a complete reversal of  luck. After being seriously injured in a car crash, she sues the doctor who hit her. Her antagonistic personality and foul mouth cause her to lose her lawsuit. With bluff and bravado, she persuades  her lawyer, Ed Masry, into giving her a job as a file clerk in his law firm.Erin finds herself intrigued by one of the cases contained in the files she's putting away. Why are people's medical records included in a simple real estate transaction? She asks Ed if she can look into it. He agrees.  What Erin finds horrifies her. A large electric utility near the small town of Hinkley has been dumping a highly toxic form of chromium into the water. Citizens in Hinkley are contracting various forms of cancer and other gravely debilitating diseases.The film's main story line tells of Erin and Ed's efforts to persuade Hinkley's citizens to join in a class action lawsuit against the utility.Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, and Aaron Echhart each  illuminate the screen with their superb performances.  In Roberts' case, it would be easy to focus on her good looks and skimpy wardrobe and slight her acting.  The fact is, though, her acting in this movie is probably her strongest attribute!  Throughout the film, Roberts' character comes off as completely natural, believable, and admirable - if not always likeable. Julia Roberts is certainly deserving of her 2001 Academy Award Best Actress award!Albert Finney (nominated for Best Spporting Actor) plays the gruff, irascible, hard-working, and totally decent lawyer Ed Masry. Finney's Oscar-worthy performance is certainly the equal of Roberts. The chemistry between Roberts, the star of modern-day female movie stars, and Finney, the grizzled veteran of stage and screen, sparkles.Aaron Eckhart' s portrayal of George, the biker-turned-boyfriend and live-in baby-sitter is a refreshing change from the typical - and expected - Harley-Davidson rider stereotype. As Eckhart depicts him, George is smart, tender-hearted, probably a bit lazy, possessed with a wanderlust he keeps under control, and a thoroughly decent fellow.How director Steven Soderbergh managed to keep &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; from becoming another tedious, clich&eacute;-ridden legal and family drama is intriguing, and is probably one of the key reasons for the movie's tremendous popularity. It would have been easy to turn &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; into a film filled with stereotypical courtroom pyrotechnics; long, idealistic speeches about the &quot;little guy&quot; versus corporate America; and characters that are either too easy to hate or too easy to love.That's pretty much what I expected when I began watching the movie. Instead, I witnessed a film filled with ordinary, decent people... people with faults, to be sure; but all living their lives as best they can. Instead of slick lawyers seeking victory at any cost, there are attorneys zealously representing their clients to the best of their abilities. Instead of hapless, pitiable victims of corporate greed, the townspeople of Hinkley are portrayed as caring, decent, law-abiding citizens whose only concern is the welfare of their families.What Soderbergh has, in fact, done is present to his audiences a wonderful reflection of American life - the good as well as the bad. At the conclusion of this wonderful film, it's easy for viewers to walk away feeling pretty good... not only about the ultimate outcome of the movie, but also about the fact that we Americans are, for the most part, decent, caring, law-abiding citizens. And that makes &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; a film well worth seeing!",5,"&quot;WHEW!

It's amazing to think that the director, Steven Soderbergh, released Traffic in the same year as this and not many directors since Steven Spielberg in the early 90's (Jurassic Park &amp; Schindler's List in the same year) have produced two attention-grabbers like these in the same year.Besides the drama involved in the lawsuit against the chemical polluters, one aspect of this movie this is so attractive is it's family feel.  Brockovich, played by Julia Roberts, goes through life as a single mother of three and an interesting boyfriend as she tries to be &quot;Superwoman&quot; and save a small town that is slowly dying off from years of groundwater contamination.  A great performance by Roberts and equally impressive performance by Albert Finney as her boss.The DVD has some interesting extras included.  Like many modern-day DVDs that are based on actual events, there are a few documentaries interviewing the real Erin Brockovich (and her employers) along with stories from the events that actually happened.  (Watch for the sneak cameo of the real Brockovich acting as a waitress to Julia Roberts.) There is a clever short documentary about the filming of the movie included that reveals the director's intentions of making this film as close to the actual historical events as possible. (Which is a miracle in cinema!) Also included in the same documentary are interviews with real-life residents of the polluted town that also filled in as extras at town meetings and other scenes.The DVD includes a director's commentary and a few other small tidbits.  Not entirely impressive with it's extras included, but it's probably because I'm a little biased in that I feel films as good as this should contain many extras that show the magic behind a masterpiece.

524316,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00003CXFU,P Magnum,"[1, 3]","Erin Brockovich is based on the true story of a nearly destitute single mother of three who while working for a small lawyer, Ed Masry, has an almost forgotten a pro bono case the lawyer is working on for a family in Hinckley, CA thrown on her desk for her to file.  The case involves possible chromium contamination in the water due to negligence on the part of utilities giant Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.  Erin becomes intrigued by it and through her tireless effort and Masry's support, they ultimately win the case and receive the largest class action settlement in history.  Director Steven Soderbergh takes what could have been into a television movie of the week story and turns it into an intelligent, funny, dramatic and thought provoking film.  Julia Roberts is absolutely magnificent in the title role.  Her wardrobe in the film (pushup bras and tight clothing which are nice) garnered alot of attention, but they are merely a sideshow to the best acting job of her career.  She makes us feel for the situation Erin is in and through her compassion for the people of Hinckley, we too become involved and concerned for them as well.  Albert Finney contributes his usual first rate acting to the role of Ed Masry.  He perfectly plays off Ms. Roberts, absorbing the rants and abuse she heaps on him and then returning the favor with a few zingers of his own.

Ah, Runaway Bride, another Romanic comedy, and Notting Hill before that, same genre. So what  on earth is she doing in a true-life drama? A lot actually......... I have  to admit, I am a bit of a Julia Roberts fan, but never in my life did I  expect she is this good. No, good is not the right word; Oscar worthy only  comes close. That might make me a bit biased towards her but even the  cynics cannot denied that she has broken her &quot;pretty woman&quot; mould  and become a true character actor, besides Julia Roberts, her co-star  Albert Finney is also excellent as Ed Masery, he almost steels the show  with his subtle and convincing portrayal of Erin's boss and friend.As I  said and you probably know, this film is based on a true-life story about a  woman with no skills who found out something weird is going on and sued a  multi-billion-corporation company and won the largest lawsuit payout in  American history. So what makes this film differ from other  &quot;true-life-dramas&quot;? Well, a lot of the credit must be given to  Julia Roberts, her portrayal of the real Erin is truly convincing. Her  performance brings the character to life; the audience can truly FEEL the  way she felt, I've seen this film twice in the theatre and it's just as  good the second time around.The script is sharpe, some of the dialogue  from Erin is really humorous, and the drama is dealt with care and  precision.

524320,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXFU,Reviewer,"[0, 1]","A tenacious file clerk for a small law firm, curious about some information included in the file of a pro bono case, purses it and  ultimately becomes a major player in a huge lawsuit involving hundreds of  people in ""Erin Brockovich,"" a movie based on actual events, directed by  Steven Soderbergh.  When Erin (Julia Roberts) questions why medical records  are included in the file of a simple real estate transaction between a  public utilities company and some homeowners in the town of Hinckley,  California, she uncovers information that PG&amp;E may have been  responsible for water pollution that may have caused widespread illness and  even death among the citizens of Hinckley.  But truth is one thing, and  having the resources to fight a company worth billions of dollars is  another.  And that's the problem that falls into the lap of lawyer Ed Masry  (Albert Finney), owner of the law firm that employs Brockovich.  Millions  of dollars, as well as justice for those who have been harmed is at stake,  but it's a case of David versus Goliath, and Masry has reservations as to  whether or not he is up to the task; the meager resources of his firm will  only go so far, while the utility could tie them up in court for years and  not feel a thing.  Masry, however, has something else to consider:  Erin  Brockovich, who has latched on to this case harder than a pit bull on a  mailman's trousers.  Julia Roberts gives one of the best performances  of her career in this film, as the sassy, brazen Brockovich, who tells it  like it is and won't take ""no"" for an answer.  She captures ever grain of  realism in bringing Erin's story to life; this woman who was down on her  luck, but refused to give in to circumstances that overwhelmingly stacked  the odds against her.  She perfectly conveys the sense of frustration felt  by this single mother of three who, unemployed, and with no help or  prospects in sight, simply would not quit on her own life or let her  children down.  It's a gritty, charismatic performance with a depth that  aptly demonstrates what kind of person Brockovich really is; not a portrait  of a superwoman or a story made up of overblown, feigned heroics, but of a  self-assured, very real person with too much pride and integrity to turn  away from the truth and people in need.  Albert Finney is also outstanding  as Masry, the honest, hard working lawyer who finds his horizons somewhat  expanded by Erin's zeal.  He's something of a decent, regular guy with a  good marriage, small but successful practice and diabetes.  And Finney  brings him to life with a performance that should get him an Oscar  nomination at the very least.  It's tough taking the part of an average Joe  and making him memorable, and it's a credit to Finney's ability as an actor  that he succeeds so well in doing so.  The solid supporting cast  includes Aaron Eckhart, exemplary in his role of George, the man in Erin's  life; Marg Helgenberger (Donna Jensen); Cherry Jones (Pamela Duncan); Peter  Coyote (Kurt Potter); and Conchata Ferrell (Brenda).  One of the best  movies of the year, ""Erin Brockovich"" is a well made, absorbing and  entertaining drama, well directed and superbly acted, especially by Roberts  and Finney; it's theme of the underdog fighting for justice has a universal  appeal that will get the adrenaline pumping and engage you emotionally.

524329,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXFU,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 2]","In its story, `Erin Brockovich' breaks little new ground. Essentially, it joins the ranks of earlier films such as `Silkwood,' `The Insider,' `A  Civil Action,' `The Rainmaker,' among others, each of which tells the tale  of a common `David' (be it in the form of a whistleblowing employee or  compassionate, righteous lawyer) who, against all odds, mounts a seemingly  quixotic crusade against a corporate Goliath. All the above five films  expose the shoddy and often malevolent business practices of companies that  have resulted in major health care crises for both their own employees as  well as the residents who live near the companies' facilities. In the case  of `Erin Brockovich,' the villain is the PG&amp;E electrical plant located  in the desert community of Hinckley, near Barstow, California. It seems  that the residents of this small town have been experiencing a  mind-bogglingly high number of serious illnesses and miscarriages that  PG&amp;E has assured them are not in any way related to the activities at  their site. The company has even brought in medical professionals and  toxicologists to assuage the residents' growing fears. Almost by chance,  Erin Brockovich stumbles onto this information and takes up the challenge  of fighting for the rights of these victims and exposing PG&amp;E's gross  malfeasance in the process.Looking at its bare-boned plotting, one must  concede that there really isn't much that is new here. However, thanks to a  pair of utterly smashing performances by Julia Roberts and Albert Finney  and a beautifully well-rounded portrait of a real-life heroine, this Steven  Soderbergh film emerges as a true crowd-pleasing triumph. This may, in  fact, be not only Roberts' best performance, but her finest role as well.  Erin is not a conventional do-gooder heroine. First of all, she is often  abrasive and off-putting in her demeanor. Dressed more like a fashion  devotee of Roberts' `Pretty Woman' call girl character than a serious legal  executive, Erin often launches into unrestrained, obscenity-laced tirades  at her boss, her loving boyfriend, even the corporate lawyer bigwigs sent  to help her when the case she is making comes close to completion. Yet, it  is just this no-nonsense directness that earns her the confidence of the  people she is trying so desperately to help. A twice-divorced mother of  three, she is as passionate in the defense of her own children as she is in  the defense of her case. Yet, she is a woman made up of any number of  internal contradictions. Much as she loves her children, she has made a  shambles of her life in recent years. Rootless and lacking the skills  necessary to procure a well-paying job, she practically has to beg to get  hired in the office of a lawyer who has failed to win her a settlement in a  traffic accident case. Staunchly individualistic, she refuses to tone down  her rhetoric or her temper - or to adopt the more `professional' attire of  the business world - even if it might mean that she would be taken more  seriously by those around her. She assumes that no man would be willing to  consider having a serious relationship with her because of her children and  marital track record, yet, when a man enters her life doing just that, her  insecurities and her intense commitment to the cause for which she is  fighting begin to drive him away - and her children as well. Most  fascinatingly, perhaps, we are led to wonder whether it is really the  suffering people who motivate her obsessive commitment or rather, as she  herself admits, the personal recognition she receives now when she walks  into a room and people clamor desperately to know what she thinks on an  issue. All credit to Susannah Grant for writing a character so full of  believable paradoxes. Obnoxious as Erin is at times, her innate vitality,  wisdom and warm-hearted compassion consistently shine forth. Grant, by  making her such a three-dimensional figure, mitigates much of the  incredibility that lies at the root of this story, true though it may  be.And, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.  She conveys each conflicting mood and character trait perfectly. Never  before has this actress brought such a breezy assurance to her every action  and statement. She literally holds this rich film together, forcing us to  focus intently on the storm of emotions taking place deep inside this  complex woman. This is definitely Oscar-caliber work. Equally brilliant is  Albert Finney as Ed Masry, the lawyer for whom Erin works, a jovial,  easygoing man who watches with a bemused appreciation as Erin hurls  colorful invective at him, rages against the system and dresses down with  withering sarcasm not only the legal representatives from PG&amp;E but the  seasoned lawyers Masry himself has hired to help bring home the case. One  of Erin's most endearing traits is that she is an equal opportunity  harridan - a fact that wins Masry over every bit as much as it does  us.If `Erin Brockovich' has a weakness, it comes in the form of Erin's  romantic relationship with the unemployed motorcycle rider next door. He  seems simply too good to be true, and, although we know that it is  necessary to fill in this particular part of Erin's life to make her  portrait a well-rounded and complete one, it is still the least interesting  and believable part of the tale. We feel we are being too often distracted  from the meaty center of the story.Still, this is a minor quibble about  a film that works so beautifully on so many levels. As Erin Brockovich,  Julia Roberts has finally found the role uniquely suited to her enormous  talents and she blazes forth more brightly than she has ever done before.  I, for one, will be roundly rooting for her come Oscar night.",4,a brilliant performance in a wonderful film,966038400,"08 12, 2000",2000,5794,"['story', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'breaks', 'little',

This cover up went on for a long time, until a barely-employable spitfire named Erin Brockovich, working for the lawyer Ed Masry, uncovers a strange file of real estate documents which include medical records.  Curious as to why a real estate file would contain medical documents, she begins to research the case.What follows is the true story of a woman named Erin Brockovich, who together with Ed Masry uncovered a major cover up of a health hazard resulting in one of the largest settlements in history.  This film is extremely well done, dividing its time between Erin the worker, Erin the single-mom trying her best to raise her three kids, and Erin the human being.  The movie skates over the fact that the real Erin got sick along with the rest of the town (although you can see some cut scenes of her illness in the ""deleted scenes"" feature).The movie is definitely a dramatized reproduction of the true story, though it still manages to hold very close to the truth.  A&E; has done a special on the Erin Brockovich case which proves the movie stays true to form.  Julia Roberts as Erin and Albert Finney as Ed Masry both give excellent performances.  The movie isn't necessarily fast-paced but the dialogue is intriguing, intense at times, and funny at times, keeping the entertainment level high.

The title character, who I guess we are all supposed to see as a sharp, tough woman, seemed to me little more than someone with such a chip on her shoulder she was bowing under the weight.  Her law partner (who was excellently played by Albert Finney) was nothing but kind to her, and she was constantly accusing him of trying to cheat her or of going behind her back.  He gave her a car, for Heaven's sake, and she was still treating him like the enemy.  Her refusal to dress professionally wasn't funny, either..it was an indication to me that she was a person who was determined to be rude to others.Since seeing the film, I have read more about Ms. Brockovitch and discovered that the story in the film is only half of the truth anyway.  Many people in the town she &quot;saved&quot; found that their settlements were much smaller than the settlements of people who were particular &quot;buddies&quot; of Erin's..not to mention the fact that the chemical everyone in the film was so upset about is certainly present in Erin's cigarettes in far greater concentration than it was in the water, and that that particular chemical has STILL never been proven to do damage to people.An interesting film, I guess, but certainly not one I have a desire to see again.",2,Only Julia could make this character remotely likeable,1039132800,"12 6, 2002",2002,1458,"['Having', 'heard', 'hoopla', 'surrounding', 'film', 'was', 'fairly', 'eager', 'see', 'so', 'when', 'father-in-law', 'gave', 'Christmas', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'much', 'time.I', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'though', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'guess', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'sharp', 'tough', 'woman', 'seemed', 'little', 'more', 'someone', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'was', 'bowing', 'weight', 'law', 'partner', 'who', 'was', 'excellently', 'played', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'was', 'nothing', 'kind', 'was', 'constantly', 'accusing', 'trying', 'cheat', 'going', 'back', 'gave', 'car', 'Heaven', 'sake', 'was', 'still', 'treating', 'enemy', 'refusal', 'dress', 'professionally', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'either..it', 'was', 'indication', 'was', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'determined', 'be', 'rude', 'others.Since', 'seeing', 'film', 'have', 'read', 'more', 'Ms.', 'Brockovitch', 'discovered', 'story', 'film', 'only', 'half', 'truth', 'anyway', 'Many', 'people', 'town', 'quot', 'saved', 'quot', 'found', 'settlements', 'were', 'much', 'smaller', 'settlements', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'particular', 'quot', 'buddies', 'quot', ""Erin's..not"", 'mention', 'fact', 'chemical', 'everyone', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'about', 'certainly', 'present', 'Erin', 'cigarettes', 'far', 'greater', 'concentration', 'was', 'water', 'particular', 'chemical', 'STILL', 'never', 'been', 'proven', 'do', 'damage', 'people.An', 'interesting', 'film', 'guess', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'again']",Erin Brockovich VHS

Roberts is perfectly cast as the titular (no pun intended) character, a 30-something ex-beauty queen with the mouth of a truck driver and the body of a Barbie doll, as well as its sense of responsibility.  Down on her luck after two failed marriages (surprise), three kids (surprise) and no money in the bank (surprise), Brockovich hooks up with a broken down ambulance chaser (played marvelously by the always affable Albert Finney) following a car accident that may have been her fault.  After practically extorting a job from Finney, she latches onto the plight of a California town, whose bumpkinish residents have been slow-poisoned by the local power utility.  The movie wants to tell a David-and-Goliath story about a ""common"" woman taking on the big, bad corporation, but too often the motives of Brocovich get clouded by her self-indulgent behavior.  For instance, she routinely dumps her kids on whoever will watch them, including a scary-looking but kind-hearted biker who just wants a girlfriend that's actually around.  Though she claims her crusade is for the residents--she even seems to sacrifice her health for the case--ego seems to be more the impetus, as she basks in the adulation of the townspeople and takes generous swipes at anyone with a formal education, all while routinely running as far away from her own family as possible.

Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[1, 1]","Julia Roberts is winsome and not at all cloying in this *Silkwood* meets *Love Canal* meets *Marie* meets *Pretty Woman* extravaganza. In fact, I'd almost admit I'm beginning to like her, now that I've gotten past all the years of oppressive hype. But it's not her fault. She seems like a genuinely nice woman who is growing up to be a competent actress. And *Erin Brockovich* supplies her with just the kind of role that the world like's to see her in - beleaguered but with spunk (an often repellant combination). She plays the real-life whistle-blower of the title (the real Erin has a role as a waitress in the movie), and proves she's a real actress by following the time-honored path beaten by Hollywood actresses since time immemorial - playing white trash. But, of course, she's white trash with a heart of gold, who cares only about taking care of her three children, and finding justice in the world. With her bra showing most of the time, and her New Jersey-deluxe hair, she actually does a credible job of it, and that's where it's possible to develop compassion for her character. And thank God for that - for without her, there's little else memorable about this movie that makes it any different than the kind of movies made for the Lifetime channel. Finney is excellent as her boss, and the handsome Latham is wasted as the boyfriend when the love story just kind of fizzles out. Many say it's the best work Roberts has done. I wouldn't know. But, I'm always a sucker for seeing the little guy win against the behemoth powers-that-be, and even though it's been done over and over again (*A Civil Action* ring any bells? *Norma Rae*?)",4,Hmmm...,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,1649,"['Julia', 'Roberts', 'winsome', 'not', 'cloying', '*Silkwood*', 'meets', '*Love', 'Canal*', 'meets', '*Marie*', 'meets', '*Pretty', 'Woman*', 'extravaganza', 'fact', ""'d"", 'almost', 'admit', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'like', 'now', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'years', 'oppressive', 'hype', 'not', 'fault', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'woman', 'who', 'growing', 'up', 'be', 'competent', 'actress', '*Erin', 'Brockovich*', 'just', 'kind', 'role', 'world', 'see', 'beleaguered', 'spunk', 'often', 'repellant', 'combination', 'real-life', 'whistle-blower', 'title', 'real', 'Erin', 'role', 'waitress', 'movie', 'real', 'actress', 'following', 'time-honored', 'path', 'beaten', 'Hollywood', 'actresses', 'time', 'immemorial', 'playing', 'white', 'trash', 'course', 'white', 'trash', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'only', 'taking', 'care', 'three', 'children', 'finding', 'justice', 'world', 'bra', 'showing', 'most', 'time', 'New', 'Jersey-deluxe', 'hair', 'actually', 'credible', 'job', 'where', 'possible', 'develop', 'compassion', 'character', 'thank', 'God', 'little', 'else', 'memorable', 'movie', 'different', 'kind', 'movies', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'Finney', 'excellent', 'boss', 'handsome', 'Latham', 'wasted', 'boyfriend', 'when', 'love', 'story', 'just', 'kind', 'fizzles', 'out', 'Many', 'say', 'best', 'work', 'Roberts', 'done', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'always', 'sucker', 'seeing', 'little', 'guy', 'win', 'behemoth', 'powers-that-be', 'even', 'been', 'done', 'over', 'again', '*A', 'Civil', 'Action*', 'ring', 'bells', '*Norma', 'Rae*']",Erin Brockovich VHS

A hooker, a movie star, a step mom, and Tinkerbell are among a handful of Roberts' roles in the past decade.  And in that time Julia Roberts has become ""America's Darling"" and one of the most recognizable (and highest paid) actresses in the history of cinema.  Yet, she has never clutched an Oscar in all those years.  So, to say that her Oscar-nominated performance in Erin Brockovich is well deserved would be a tragic understatement.  Roberts takes on the roll of a double divorcee-single mother of three struggling to earn enough money to get by.  Playing Brockovich is easily the most challenging role of Roberts' illustrious career.  But it was also, in turn, the greatest performance of her career.  What makes this a standout role for Roberts is the fact that she has built up that ""squeaky-clean"" image over the course of her career.  She almost always played the role of the vixen, or the damsel in her most memorable movies.  But now, she plays a foul-mouthed, and cunning ex-beauty queen... a far cry from Tinkerbell indeed.  And Julia Roberts stood and delivered the entire length of the movie.  However, Roberts is not the only one to make the movie as great as it is.  Steven Soderbergh's directing job is flawless in this film.  He helped create a movie based on a true story that is, in fact, very believable, humorous, witty, clever, and moving all at the same time.

It is a movie about a very serious and true event that adds enough humor and comic touches throughout it to keep it interesting and entertaining.A down and out, twice divorced, single mother desperately looking for a job finally bullies her way into a job in a law office using the excuse that since her lawyer lost her injury case that he said she would win that he owed her.She ends up looking into some real estate files that have medical records attached to them and is confused.  As she delves deeper, she is shocked and horrified at finding that a major energy company has been dumping toxic chromium waste knowing that it is getting into the water system and making people sick, etc.  She convinces her boss to help the people by taking the matter to court.  Absolutely fascinating!Her choice of clothes is not the demure business type but more on the floozy side.  The cast of characters are absolutely outstanding and work perfectly together.

524370,A5CWLQF6QO3CN,B00003CXFU,"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","[0, 1]","Erin Brockovich could be regarded as one the outstanding movies made by Julia Roberts in the recent years. My Best Friend's Wedding was good, but  Rupert had stolen much of her attention from the audience. Notting Hill was  also good but the beautiful scenery and the superb supporting cast had  shared the glory. Erin Brockovich was a good one woman show for Julia and  she undoubtedly had picked up a good script and made a good movie.The  story was not very complicated, with a new single mom bumped into all sorts  of bad luck in a short period of time, that finally turned out to be a  breakthrough of fate for a successful career in the legal profession. There  are lots of gags and funny lines throughout the movie, particularly like  her attitude against the other female lawyer who originally despised  Julia's qualification to be in the legal industry. However, funny lines  were not the only thing offered by this movie. There is a good description  between Julia and her boy friend, Julia and her eldest son, Julia and her  clients (which was of vital importance in the whole story) and Julia and  her boss.What made this movie a successful one was that it tactfully  combined different elements in a single movie and the chemistry was just  right to the point. Humorous but touching, intriguing but sweet are some of  the good contrasts adopted in the movie. The change of attitude of Julia's  boss to her was a very good written part of the movie, from despise to  admiring, from fury to caring etc. they were all carefully written and  portrayed.Nonetheless, there was one draw back for the movie. That was  Julia's constant dressing of low cuts in the movie (well, that helped a lot  in the movie for her to make different men yield to her requests)which I  think is not necessary in some instances. Anyway, this did not give the  movie a bad image because Julia did have a good outlook, so audiences would  still receive her happily.All in all, Erin Brockovich could be a good  cooling choice for the summer.",4,Julia made it again,966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,2025,"['Erin', 'Brockovich', 'could', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'outstanding', 'movies', 'made', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'recent', 'years', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'was', 'good', 'Rupert', 'had', 'stolen', 'much', 'attention', 'audience', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'superb', 'supporting', 'cast', 'had', 'shared', 'glory', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'woman', 'show', 'Julia', 'undoubtedly', 'had', 'picked', 'up', 'good', 'script', 'made', 'good', 'movie.The', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'complicated', 'new', 'single', 'mom', 'bumped', 'sorts', 'bad', 'luck', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'finally', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'breakthrough', 'fate', 'successful', 'career', 'legal', 'profession', 'are', 'lots', 'gags', 'funny', 'lines', 'movie', 'particularly', 'attitude', 'other', 'female', 'lawyer', 'who', 'originally', 'despised', 'Julia', 'qualification', 'be', 'legal', 'industry', 'However', 'funny', 'lines', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'offered', 'movie', 'good', 'description', 'Julia', 'boy', 'friend', 'Julia', 'eldest', 'son', 'Julia', 'clients', 'was', 'vital', 'importance', 'whole', 'story', 'Julia', 'boss.What', 'made', 'movie', 'successful', 'one', 'was', 'tactfully', 'combined', 'different', 'elements', 'single', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'point', 'Humorous', 'touching', 'intriguing', 'sweet', 'are', 'good', 'contrasts', 'adopted', 'movie', 'change', 'attitude', 'Julia', 'boss', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'written', 'part', 'movie', 'despise', 'admiring', 'fury', 'caring', 'etc', 'were', 'carefully', 'written', 'portrayed.Nonetheless', 'was', 'one', 'draw', 'back', 'movie', 'was', 'Julia', 'constant', 'dressing', 'low', 'cuts', 'movie', 'well', 'helped', 'lot', 'movie', 'make', 'different', 'men', 'yield', 'requests', 'think', 'not', 'necessary', 'instances', 'Anyway', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'movie', 'bad', 'image', 'Julia', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'outlook', 'audiences', 'would', 'still', 'receive', 'happily.All', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'cooling', 'choice', 'summer']",Erin Brockovich VHS
524371,A3POUK5BO810DD,B00003CXFU,T. Wu,"[2, 4]","Watching Julia Roberts play a jobless, skillness single mother whose greatest glory in life was winning a local beauty pageant, might make you wonder what she really thinks. Though Erin Brockovich achieved success far beyond what most in her position would, Roberts is consistently playing down to a station far beneath her own. While not unique in this film or for this actress, its particular noticeable in the contrasts here. Roberts is the only true ""welfare queen"" that ever lived, the Queen of Hollywood playing a destitute single mother, giving a chance for the ""common American"" (or at least the lower middle class single mothers out there) to live vicariously through her. Does she actually empathize with her subject or feel only a professional patronizing cynicism, as if we, the peons of life, must watch a film like this to lift us up from our ""hum-drum little lives"" (to borrow a quote from Jean Hagen)?Cynical or empathetic, Erin Brockovich at least manages to deliver. When it takes flight from reality it is entertaining and when it hits home on everyday realities it is deeply troubling. A sharp reverse in gender roles is deeply evident, with the pedagogically talented boyfriend watching the kids 24/7 while Brockovich goes off to pursue the substance of the film. Once this logistical arrangement is established, the boyfriend's screen time drops off dramatically, and it might seem at times that we are only to be reminded later that, oh yeah, they still exist (how dull), but that is an unfair interpretation. Brockovich's family gets more screen time and substance than the families of the protagonists of any other typical Hollywood thriller would get (Ordinarily we dont see the wife and kids unless they are in physical danger, or unless a sex scene is about to happen). The movie is conscious of its own gender reversal and thrusts the challenge of balancing work and family into the light, tackling the awkward compromises head-on. Indeed, there are very deep though somewhat implicit family values dominating the film, and its to the credit of the scriptwriters that they were able to mix legal thriller and family drama as if they themselves were working parents trying to balance work and home. Certainly a unique film.",4,How do you think Julia Roberts really feels?,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,2251,"['Watching', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'play', 'jobless', 'skillness', 'single', 'mother', 'greatest', 'glory', 'life', 'was', 'winning', 'local', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'might', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'really', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'achieved', 'success', 'far', 'what', 'most', 'position', 'would', 'Roberts', 'consistently', 'playing', 'down', 'station', 'far', 'own', 'not', 'unique', 'film', 'actress', 'particular', 'noticeable', 'contrasts', 'here', 'Roberts', 'only', 'true', 'welfare', 'queen', 'ever', 'lived', 'Queen', 'Hollywood', 'playing', 'destitute', 'single', 'mother', 'giving', 'chance', 'common', 'American', 'least', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'single', 'mothers', 'there', 'live', 'vicariously', 'actually', 'empathize', 'subject', 'feel', 'only', 'professional', 'patronizing', 'cynicism', 'peons', 'life', 'must', 'watch', 'film', 'lift', 'up', 'hum-drum', 'little', 'lives', 'borrow', 'quote', 'Jean', 'Hagen', 'Cynical', 'empathetic', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'least', 'manages', 'deliver', 'When', 'flight', 'reality', 'entertaining', 'when', 'home', 'everyday', 'realities', 'deeply', 'troubling', 'sharp', 'reverse', 'gender', 'roles', 'deeply', 'evident', 'pedagogically', 'talented', 'boyfriend', 'watching', 'kids', '24/7', 'Brockovich', 'pursue', 'substance', 'film', 'Once', 'logistical', 'arrangement', 'established', 'boyfriend', 'screen', 'time', 'dramatically', 'might', 'seem', 'times', 'are', 'only', 'be', 'reminded', 'later', 'oh', 'yeah', 'still', 'exist', 'how', 'dull', 'unfair', 'interpretation', 'Brockovich', 'family', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'substance', 'families', 'protagonists', 'other', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'would', 'get', 'Ordinarily', 'dont', 'see', 'wife', 'kids', 'are', 'physical', 'danger', 'sex', 'scene', 'happen', 'movie', 'conscious', 'own', 'gender', 'reversal', 'challenge', 'balancing', 'work', 'family', 'light', 'tackling', 'awkward', 'head-on', 'Indeed', 'are', 'very', 'deep', 'somewhat', 'implicit', 'family', 'values', 'dominating', 'film', 'credit', 'scriptwriters', 'were', 'able', 'mix', 'legal', 'thriller', 'family', 'drama', 'were', 'working', 'parents', 'trying', 'balance', 'work', 'home', 'Certainly', 'unique', 'film']",Erin Brockovich VHS

Unfortunately, to some extent it felt like a 'painting-by-numbers' exercise.EB recounts the unlikely story of an unemployed, divorced mother who talks her way into a clerical job, spots an anomoly in an - apparently minor - real estate deal and goes on to successfully sue a large conglomerate for a record sum.What is unusual about this film is that story, though unlikely, is based in fact and the film direction largely avoids the usual clich&eacute;s of painting all the characters as heroes and villians.  In fact, other than a couple of minor characters there are no 'baddies' in the film at all.  The story concentrates more on the efforts of 'little people' to get on with their lives and what happens when they come up against the apparently immovable bulk of a multi-million dollar organization that is damaging their lives.Albert Finney certainly excels as the lawyer but the casting of Julia Roberts, a major, rich and confident Hollywood star, as EB, a harrased, divorced, poor and unemployed mother, was risky.  It's a credit to her acting ability that she largely manages to carry it off.  It wasn't until I saw the interview with EB (on the DVD) that I realised how well she did.The DVD contains many deleted scenes, both as filmed and also with a talk-over by the director Steven Sonderberg.  Seeing what he cut out of the film and hearing why is a wonderful insight into the background of both the film and the original (true) story.
