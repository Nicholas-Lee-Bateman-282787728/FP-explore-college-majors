1062947,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000O7861O,B. E Jackson,"[0, 2]","I like Fred Savage.  I grew up with the Wonder Years and could relate to Fred's character and his many aggravating family and school issues, but then again, it's the kind of show that is probably relatable to *most* teenage boys.  Simply put- Fred Savage was a terrific actor for that show, not to mention a perfect choice for lead role.In the Last Run, he unfortunately proves that he isn't good enough for a main role in a movie.The storyline is obviously the worst part.  It's about a foulmouthed Fred Savage having constant desires to attend adult nightclubs so he can try to impress the ladies with his mannerisms, and supposedly this qualifies as humor but I sure as heck didn't find anything about his character remotely funny.I'm just surprised that such a lousy plot was considered good enough to actually make a movie out of it.  I definitely sensed a low budget vibe while watching the film, in both the acting and storyline.I guess Fred wanted to prove to the world that he's finally become an adult with the ability to attract women in a way that I definitely consider inappropriate what with all the swear words being tossed around (though actually his friends are more to blame than he is in this regard).  Basically Fred Savage's character is that of a sleazeball.  He wants to be in a relationship sure, but he's more concerned with scoring and showing disrespect towards women above everything else.He's not right for such a storyline but then again, nobody else would be a quality choice for such a low budget film either.The Last Run is just a terrible film that should be avoided at all costs.",2,bad movie,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,1614,"['like', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'grew', 'up', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'could', 'relate', 'Fred', 'character', 'many', 'aggravating', 'family', 'school', 'issues', 'then', 'again', 'kind', 'show', 'probably', 'relatable', '*most*', 'teenage', 'boys', 'Simply', 'put-', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'was', 'terrific', 'actor', 'show', 'not', 'mention', 'perfect', 'choice', 'lead', 'role.In', 'Last', 'Run', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'main', 'role', 'movie.The', 'storyline', 'obviously', 'worst', 'part', 'foulmouthed', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'having', 'constant', 'desires', 'attend', 'adult', 'nightclubs', 'can', 'try', 'impress', 'ladies', 'mannerisms', 'supposedly', 'humor', 'sure', 'heck', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'character', 'remotely', 'funny.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'surprised', 'lousy', 'plot', 'was', 'considered', 'good', 'enough', 'actually', 'make', 'movie', 'definitely', 'sensed', 'low', 'budget', 'vibe', 'watching', 'film', 'acting', 'storyline.I', 'guess', 'Fred', 'wanted', 'prove', 'world', 'finally', 'become', 'adult', 'ability', 'attract', 'women', 'way', 'definitely', 'consider', 'inappropriate', 'what', 'swear', 'words', 'being', 'tossed', 'actually', 'friends', 'are', 'more', 'blame', 'regard', 'Basically', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'character', 'sleazeball', 'be', 'relationship', 'sure', 'more', 'concerned', 'scoring', 'showing', 'disrespect', 'towards', 'women', 'everything', 'else.He', 'not', 'right', 'storyline', 'then', 'again', 'nobody', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'quality', 'choice', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'either.The', 'Last', 'Run', 'just', 'terrible', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs']",The Last Run
1062948,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000O7861O,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 2]","Fred Savage, the child actor fromThe Wonder Yearsis now all grown up.  Like so many child actors, he needs a way to shed his goodie-two-shoes image that he acquired as a kid actor.  Enter THE LAST RUN.Fred plays a young man who is on top of the world early in the film.  He is head-over-heels in love with the girl of his dreams (Amy Adams).  Just one problem:  his girlfriend is a ""high roller"" and a player, and she's already phasing him out of her life as soon as the opening credits are over.  Uh oh!  {As a sidenote, I don't know if Amy Adams could fill the bill as every man's fantasy, but she SURE does equal what I'd call a dreamgirl!}The inevitable break-up sends the poor guy into a tailspin.  Actually, that's an understatement.  Losing her TOTALLY wrecks his life.  (On a biographical note, I can certainly relate to this!).  The combination of getting dumped by the woman he wanted to someday marry + some very bad advice from his best friend leads to a perfect storm of bad decisions.His friend tells him to rebound by going on a string of meaningless one-night-stands.  He follows these instructions, but they end up costing him just about everything - both financially as well as emotionally.He starts spending thousands on high-priced escort girls & strippers.  It ends up costing him his job as he simply can't function anymore.  He gets to the point where he is addicted to having sex, and he actually  ends up using sex as a sort of weapon against women.  No, that's not to say he becomes a rapist.  Rather, it's the domination (i.e.:  being in control of the situation) that becomes the end-all for him.While the basic plot outline of this film sounds like material for a Romantic comedy, this is not a film that  I would categorize as an RC movie.  To be sure, there are a few funny parts (including a hilarious allusion toThe Terminator), but the overall timbre of the movie is surprisingly dark.If you're looking for a drama with a few humorous lines and a pretty good amount of gratuitous nudity, then this is a film worth checking out.  If you're gunning for a straight RC, I'd advise that you look elsewhere.  This is NOT what I'd call a ""date movie!""",4,A desperate run...,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2178,"['Fred', 'Savage', 'child', 'actor', 'fromThe', 'Wonder', 'Yearsis', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'child', 'actors', 'way', 'shed', 'goodie-two-shoes', 'image', 'acquired', 'kid', 'actor', 'Enter', 'THE', 'LAST', 'RUN.Fred', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'top', 'world', 'early', 'film', 'head-over-heels', 'love', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Just', 'one', 'problem', 'girlfriend', 'high', 'roller', 'player', 'already', 'phasing', 'life', 'as', 'soon', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'Uh', 'oh', 'sidenote', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'could', 'fill', 'bill', 'man', 'fantasy', 'SURE', 'equal', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'dreamgirl', 'inevitable', 'break-up', 'poor', 'guy', 'tailspin', 'Actually', 'understatement', 'Losing', 'TOTALLY', 'life', 'biographical', 'note', 'can', 'certainly', 'relate', 'combination', 'getting', 'dumped', 'woman', 'wanted', 'someday', 'marry', '+', 'very', 'bad', 'advice', 'best', 'friend', 'perfect', 'storm', 'bad', 'decisions.His', 'friend', 'rebound', 'going', 'string', 'meaningless', 'one-night-stands', 'instructions', 'end', 'up', 'costing', 'just', 'everything', 'financially', 'as', 'well', 'emotionally.He', 'spending', 'thousands', 'high-priced', 'escort', 'girls', 'strippers', 'up', 'costing', 'job', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'function', 'anymore', 'point', 'where', 'addicted', 'having', 'sex', 'actually', 'up', 'using', 'sex', 'sort', 'weapon', 'women', 'No', 'not', 'say', 'rapist', 'Rather', 'domination', 'i.e', 'being', 'control', 'situation', 'end-all', 'him.While', 'basic', 'plot', 'outline', 'film', 'material', 'Romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'categorize', 'RC', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'parts', 'including', 'hilarious', 'allusion', 'toThe', 'Terminator', 'overall', 'timbre', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'dark.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'drama', 'few', 'humorous', 'lines', 'pretty', 'good', 'amount', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'then', 'film', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'gunning', 'straight', 'RC', ""'d"", 'advise', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'NOT', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'date', 'movie']",The Last Run

They would have taken perverse amusement from plugging a has-been child-star into a grind-house level comedy.  Fred Savage was always more narrator than actor and the movie's voiceover commentary probably seemed like a good fit.Unfortunately the script is moronic even by Mitchell Brothers standards and there are no likely ""Ivory Snow"" mothers in the cast; the women in this movie look like aging escort service girls lured out of a local AA meeting or bowling alley.  You know these marginal actresses are high mileage because the script calls for the male characters to incessantly discuss how young and beautiful they are.It does have a pre-""Enchanted"" (and then unknown) Amy Adams in the cast.  You mostly know this because she gets top billing on the 2007 promotional poster and DVD package (a marketing thing); although she is only in about 10% of the footage, and even then as secondary player in the scenes.  During her brief appearances she is responsible for the films only funny moments; not because of what she says but because of the way she says it.  She has enough natural comedic talent to make something out of nothing even in a crash-and-burn turkey like ""The Last Run"".  Unless you absolutely have to see everything Adams has appeared in, there is no reason to seek out this DVD.Then again, what do I know?
