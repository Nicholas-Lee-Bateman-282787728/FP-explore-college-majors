The acting was great, the story was excellent and the direction was phenomenal.  Adepero Oduye is an incredible find!!  May this young actress have a long and illustrious career!The one thing I didn't like was Kim Wayans' character.  I thought Kim Wayans the actress was on her AAA game and I believe she is a criminally underused talent in Hollywood.  But her character has to be one of the most unlovable, nonredeeming characters in modern cinema!  No wonder her husband feels so free to be a bastard with her!  I thought there was this one moment where she would soften and I'd see what motivated her, what made her tick.  Nuh-uh!  She remained a total enigma to me until the very end.Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie, see it.

1498579,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005S9EIGU,Grady Harp,"[10, 12]","Writer/Director Dee Rees is an inordinately talented newcomer. If PARIAH is indicative of the quality of films she will create, then we are in for a new level of verismo cinema. She tackles a tough subject - same sex relationships among African American women - with such insight and care to details that her film jumps off the screen screaming as in the words of her heroine `I'm not running - I'm choosing': lesbian girls are not God's mistake (to quote the mother figure) but instead have the courage to accept their difference and embrace their sexuality and still become successful members of society.Alike/Lee (Adepero Oduye, a fine young actress who hails from Brooklyn by way of Nigeria, a graduate of Cornell University who has studied acting with Wynn Handman, Austin Pendleton, and Susan Batson) is a 17-year old sexually conflicted girl who lives in Brooklyn with her younger very bright sister Sharonda (Sahra Mellesse) and her parents - police detective father Arthur (Charles Parnell) and conservative, overprotective, biased mother Audrey (Kim Wayans). Alike is an excellent student, a blossoming poet, and a lesbian: she maintains tow life styles complete with clothes changes so that she can be the `daughter' at home and herself outside the home. Alike's best friend Laure (Pernell Walker) is her support system as Laure is comfortable about being out as a lesbian. Alike's home life is strained as her ever arguing parents disagree on many factors, on of them being Alike's need to appear like a man. Audrey arranges for Alike to become friends with Bina (Aasha Davis) who is the daughter of one of Audrey's friends, an encouragement that eventually leads to Alike's surprise first sexual experience with a girl who is just `doing her own thing' - ie, not a lesbian. This deeply affects Alike, she delves more deeply into her poetry and graduates early because of her shining school record. At a point of no return she is confronted by her parents and the manner in which she makes her decision as to `run or choose' provides the ending of the story.The cast is uniformly strong and though Adepero Oduye makes a show-stopping debut, the other actors are equally superb. Bradford Young is the cinematographer who helps create the atmosphere. The dialogue is delivered in street language and is often covered with shouting and with multiple characters talking simultaneously: subtitles help here. But the genius of the film is in the concept and the courage and in the amazing gift for creating meaning cinema that comes across as the work of Dee Rees.  She is a talent to watch.

This coming-of-age film from newcomer Dee Rees tells the story of an African-American 17 year old anxious to express her sexual identity.  She comes from a strict religious home and Alike's (terrific Adepero Oduye) homosexuality hasn't been addressed with her parents (Kim Wayans and Charles Parrnell).Alike's best friend Laura (Pernell Walker), is ""out"" and tries to hook her up to lose the ""V"" standing.  Alike wants a relationship first and believes she may have found it with Bina (Aasha Davis) who she met through an associate of her mother's.  Bina is experimenting with her sexuality and when she plants a kiss on Alike, Alike bolts.  When looking at the story from a distance, it is something that has been played out many times in the past.  What makes it provocative is that we are talking about black teen-age girls, who like other black teen-age girls.  The performances are excellent, especially Ms. Oduye.

Alike is discovering that she likes girls better than guys. Alike's mom picks up on the fact that Alike is going through a ""tomboy"" phase, and is urging dad to do something about it. Dad, however, has his own problems (the movie shows a short phone call that one might interpret he has another lady in his world) and besides (as he says) ""Alike is always daddy's girl"". Needless to say, a lot of tension builds up between mom and dad and Alike. To reveal more from the plot would spoil the pleasure of watching this movie, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.A lot has been made of the fact that this is a movie about a ""black teenage girl coming out"". I guess I really don't see at all what the relevance is, if any, of the race or color in this movie. What I saw was an intense family drame, set in contemporary Brooklyn, New York. It's not even so much a ""lesbian"" movie. I came away impressed by the fact that this is writer-director Dee Rees' debute film, as the movie certainly doesn't feel like the work of a novice.There are a number of acting performances worth noting, none more so of course than Adepero Oduye in the role of Alike, but also Kim Wayans as Alike's mom and Charles Parnell as Alike's dad. Last but not least, there was plenty of great music featured in the movie (unfortunately the credits went by so quickly I barely had time to register all the music that was featured, although I did notice that Reema Major has 5 or so songs credited).

I am amazed at Dee Rees' Indie effort, and the brilliant central character played by Adepero Oduye. Intelligence abounds, from the direction, acting, script and the incredibly personal cinematography.I'd heard of the film from its many awards and finally checked it out. The very personal and insecure issues a young gay person faces are difficult to explain, often to one's self; Ms Oduye handles this complex dilemma with care, concern and precision. I was never in doubt of her sincerity.Her best friend, Laure (Pernell Walker) is excellent, as a tuff bull-dyke wannabe, with a heart of gold. The confused parents, ably performed by Kim Wayans and, especially, Charles Parnell, hit strong nerves. Indeed, the entire cast is flawless, and the crisp close-up photography belies its Indie status.My only argument is that it involves middle-class black folks.

As a black lesbian I'm happy to see there is a black film aimed in a serious way on a LGBT-subject without comic relief.  Adepero Oduye, an actress I never heard of until this film, challenges her character well in this heartfelt role.  Kim Wayans, someone who most of us grew up laughing at thanks to 'In Living Color' also plays the overprotective mother of Alike and also deals with a struggling marriage.

1498594,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005S9EIGU,Turfseer,"[9, 20]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Pariah' is the feature length expansion of a short film created by Dee Rees, presented at the Sundance Festival in 2007. It's basically a coming of age story focusing on a middle-class, black Lesbian teenager, Alike, played by Adepero Oduye. The title 'Pariah', is a bit of a strong epithet to describe Alike's situation, as she's mainly an outcast in the eyes of her mother Audrey (Kim Wayans), a devout Christian, who can't stomach the idea that her daughter is not really interested in men.'Pariah' is uniformly well-acted with a slow-moving plot that holds few surprises. In fact, take away the black middle-class environment and you'd be left with pretty much your ordinary 'coming out' tale of a conflicted gay teenager. All the stock characters are there including the 'villain' of the piece, the aforementioned intolerant mother as well as the more sympathetic police detective father, Arthur, who's not crazy about his daughter's choice of sexual orientation  but still holds a special place in his heart for 'daddy's girl'. Also in the mix is Alike's best friend, Laura, who enjoys hanging out at 'rough' Lesbian clubs but eventually decides to get her GED. While Alike still enjoys a bond with one parent, Laura is not on speaking terms with her mother, who shows no interest when Laura rings her doorbell and informs her that she's passed her GED.Eventually, Alike's Mom introduces her to Bina, the daughter of one of her colleagues at work (strikingly played by Aasha Davis). The Mom finds Bina much more acceptable since she comes from a more upper class environment than what she regards as the lower class world Laura comes from. Bina invites Alike over to her house and makes it clear that she's interested in having an intimate encounter. At first Alike admits the proposition makes her uncomfortable but on a 'second date', the proposed tryst is consummated. The twist is that Bina is merely bi-curious and Alike is sorely disappointed that she won't be having an extended relationship with her for the foreseeable future. Alike's reaction is predictable: a full-scale meltdown where she trashes her own room.'Pariah' concludes also on a predictable note. Alike's Mom again chastises her for disappearing and then the parents argue over the mother's suspicion that the father has been having an affair. Alike declares her independence when she reveals to her father that she's been accepted into a creative writing program and asks his permission to sign papers so she can leave home.I suspect that deep down, 'Pariah' has garnered so many accolades not because it's a great film, but precisely because critics wish to encourage the film's creator, Ms. Rees, who apparently has much more talent as a director than a screenwriter. In terms of the writing, perhaps Ms. Rees' strongest suit is dialogue, which has a realistic, gritty feel to it. I also liked her choice of alternative rock for the soundtrack, instead of loud, rap music, which is the type of music one would expect to find in a drama of this kind.'Pariah' is a well-crafted first feature effort. You'll find very good acting here and a story that will pretty much hold your interest to the end. Nonetheless, I didn't find myself invested enough in the protagonist's journey to end up raving about the film as so many others have done. By film's end, with Alike's decision to branch off on her own, my reaction was, ""okay, that's nice!"" In essence, the filmmaker is saying that those who have been ostracized in society need to go forward in spite of all the criticism. But most young people must go through obstacles in order to achieve independence. Were Alike's difficulties in 'coming of age', that much different than other teenagers? Not really. Hence, I didn't feel I was watching something so 'different' or 'out of the ordinary'. It's up to Ms. Rees to next take on a project that goes beyond the world that she knows so well about and is comfortable with.",3,"Well-acted but standard coming of age tale of black, middle-class Lesbian teenager",1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,3988,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Pariah"", 'feature', 'length', 'expansion', 'short', 'film', 'created', 'Dee', 'Rees', 'presented', 'Sundance', 'Festival', '2007', 'basically', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'focusing', 'middle-class', 'black', 'Lesbian', 'teenager', 'Alike', 'played', 'Adepero', 'Oduye', 'title', ""'Pariah"", 'bit', 'strong', 'epithet', 'describe', 'Alike', 'situation', 'mainly', 'outcast', 'eyes', 'mother', 'Audrey', 'Kim', 'Wayans', 'devout', 'Christian', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'idea', 'daughter', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'men', ""'Pariah"", 'uniformly', 'well-acted', 'slow-moving', 'plot', 'few', 'surprises', 'fact', 'take', 'away', 'black', 'middle-class', 'environment', ""'d"", 'be', 'left', 'pretty', 'much', 'ordinary', ""'coming"", 'out', 'tale', 'conflicted', 'gay', 'teenager', 'stock', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'including', ""'villain"", 'piece', 'aforementioned', 'intolerant', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'police', 'detective', 'father', 'Arthur', 'who', 'not', 'crazy', 'daughter', 'choice', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'still', 'special', 'place', 'heart', ""'daddy"", 'girl', 'Also', 'mix', 'Alike', 'best', 'friend', 'Laura', 'who', 'hanging', 'out', ""'rough"", 'Lesbian', 'clubs', 'eventually', 'get', 'GED', 'Alike', 'still', 'bond', 'one', 'parent', 'Laura', 'not', 'speaking', 'terms', 'mother', 'who', 'interest', 'when', 'Laura', 'doorbell', 'passed', 'GED.Eventually', 'Alike', 'Mom', 'Bina', 'daughter', 'one', 'colleagues', 'work', 'strikingly', 'played', 'Aasha', 'Davis', 'Mom', 'Bina', 'much', 'more', 'acceptable', 'more', 'upper', 'class', 'environment', 'what', 'lower', 'class', 'world', 'Laura', 'Bina', 'Alike', 'house', 'clear', 'interested', 'having', 'intimate', 'encounter', 'first', 'Alike', 'proposition', 'uncomfortable', ""'second"", 'date', 'proposed', 'tryst', 'consummated', 'twist', 'Bina', 'merely', 'bi-curious', 'Alike', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'having', 'extended', 'relationship', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'Alike', 'reaction', 'predictable', 'full-scale', 'meltdown', 'where', 'own', 'room', 'concludes', 'also', 'predictable', 'note', 'Alike', 'Mom', 'again', 'disappearing', 'then', 'parents', 'argue', 'mother', 'suspicion', 'father', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'Alike', 'independence', 'when', 'father', 'been', 'accepted', 'creative', 'writing', 'program', 'permission', 'sign', 'papers', 'can', 'leave', 'home.I', 'suspect', 'deep', 'down', 'garnered', 'so', 'many', 'accolades', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'precisely', 'critics', 'wish', 'encourage', 'film', 'creator', 'Ms.', 'Rees', 'who', 'apparently', 'much', 'more', 'talent', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'terms', 'writing', 'perhaps', 'Ms.', 'Rees', 'strongest', 'suit', 'dialogue', 'realistic', 'gritty', 'feel', 'also', 'liked', 'choice', 'alternative', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'instead', 'loud', 'rap', 'music', 'type', 'music', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'drama', 'kind', ""'Pariah"", 'well-crafted', 'first', 'feature', 'effort', ""'ll"", 'find', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'here', 'story', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'hold', 'interest', 'end', 'Nonetheless', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'invested', 'enough', 'protagonist', 'journey', 'end', 'up', 'raving', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'end', 'Alike', 'decision', 'branch', 'off', 'own', 'reaction', 'was', 'okay', 'nice', 'essence', 'filmmaker', 'saying', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'ostracized', 'society', 'need', 'go', 'forward', 'spite', 'criticism', 'most', 'young', 'people', 'must', 'go', 'obstacles', 'order', 'achieve', 'independence', 'Were', 'Alike', 'difficulties', ""'coming"", 'age', 'much', 'different', 'other', 'teenagers', 'Not', 'really', 'Hence', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'so', ""'different"", 'ordinary', 'up', 'Ms.', 'Rees', 'next', 'take', 'project', 'world', 'so', 'well', 'comfortable']",N/A
