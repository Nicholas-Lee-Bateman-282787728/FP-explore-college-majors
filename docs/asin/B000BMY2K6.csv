944956,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BMY2K6,A Customer,"[2, 2]","Elliot Wilbur Sherman (Michael Showalter) is a dorky and dull, but kindhearted tax accountant. Elliot has everything he could ever want, including a good job, and a nice apartment in New Jersey, but his life really becomes complete when he falls for the vivacious magazine editor, Caroline Swann (Elizabeth Banks). Although Caroline should be way out of his league, miraculously, she falls for him, too.Eliot can't believe that he's scored such a gorgeous woman, yet there's also something that draws him to bedraggled bookish office temp Cecil Mills (Michelle Williams). Maybe it's the fact that they are currently reading the dictionary for enjoyment and are both up to the same letter. Swept away by Caroline's gorgeousness, Eliot quickly proposes marriage to her, but he remains terribly nervous, apparently several past loves were swept away by dashing ex-boyfriends, and he fears the same will happen again.His darkest fears are realized when Bradley (Justin Theroux), Caroline's annoyingly perfect ex-boyfriend, and childhood sweetheart shows up by surprise at her engagement party, Elliot must watch as his best chance at happiness is stolen from under his nose. Can Elliot actually stay the course and win and marry the beautiful Caroline before Bradley reclaims his prize? Or will he end up with the quietly good-natured Cecil?The Baxter is one of those movies that will probably be instantly forgettable to most viewers, and it is agreeably silly, but it's also fun to watch and has an offbeat sense of humor that is quite touching. The real strength of the film is that the four leads - Showalter, Williams, Banks, and Theroux imbue the film with a simple, inoffensive charm. Showalter is particularly good as Elliot; he's an endearing oddball, just a little out of rhythm with New York City, a ""baxter"" who is also out of step with the rules of dating. He is fussy and talks haltingly, has a bad haircut, and is funny without being condescending.Theroux is suitably gorgeous as Bradley. A scientist who is wealthy, successful, and handsome, Bradley can break-dance, quote Keats and even weep on cue. Mr. Theroux manages to regulate the character so precisely that Bradley remains a real human being behind the smarminess.The real reason, however, to watch The Baxter is the knockout performances by its two female leads: Elizabeth Banks proves she's one of the most versatile actresses working at the moment, and her comedic range is unsurpassed. Although Banks is a sensation, the adorable Michelle Williams may have upstaged her. Ms. Williams has been lost in the shuffle a bit with all the accolades currently heaped on the boys of Brokeback Mountain, so it's wonderful to see her here, in a really strong central performance.The Baxter is subtle offbeat comedy; it's mannered, idiosyncratic, and guileless and perhaps a bit out-of-fashion, or at least decidedly non-mainstream. There's a sort of comedic irony at work here, a type of good-natured fun that is charming, but also rather naughty and irreverent. The laughs mostly stem from situational clumsiness and stupidity, and are always perfectly balanced between huge dollops of good-natured earnestness. Part of the reason The Baxter works, is that you can't help but empathize and fall in love with all of the characters.I guess the point of The Baxter is that it's wryly observing the quirky ironies of life. For all we allow others to dictate about our own self-perception and, in many cases, worth, we are still the controllers of our own destiny. Elliot must try to come to terms with his shortcomings, his life as a Baxter, it is only then that he is able to stop lying to himself and for the first time really see who truly loves him.

944957,A3HCZTTUH3CW9Z,B000BMY2K6,Amy Henley,"[1, 2]","Oddly enough, I ended up watching this movie with my Dad.  We don't always think that the same things are funny, but we both had the same reaction: ""this is either the worst movie I have ever seen, or the best!""  The Baxters/Baxterettes go awkwardly through their lives.  So much so that it makes one cringe.  Think of scenes from The Office (British or American versions). The Baxters/ Baxterettes are so earnest and pathetic.  It is like watching a car accident.  You can't believe someone would act that way.  A guy whose last time saying up late was during finals week in Business school?  A guy who does not know anything about beer?  Two people who read the dictionary for fun?  When will the madness end!  I admit at that point I was worried about the rest of the movie.  I couldn't tell whether the writing was tongue in cheek.  Is it possible that the Baxter himself was in on the joke, hmmmmmm?  Were we the ones not getting it?  I don't know when it happened, but I began to find their habits and mannerisms endearing.  I thought ""my God, they such geeks, but they are trying so hard to find love!""This movie brings home the points that there is someone out there for everyone, and it is never to late to find new love or rekindle old passion. Elliot, the Baxter in the title, has narrowly missed finding the love of his life several times, or has he?  The old flame of every one of his girlfriends has  stolen her right out from underneath him.  He keeps trying to find love, but could he be sabatoging himself?  Can he break free of the past?  This movie is an interesting study in coincidences.  What series of events had to happen in just the right sequence for someone to fall in love, or get dumped, or run into an old flame, or all three at the same time, This movie shows how through a series of misadventures and coincidences Eilliot learns about life and love until he finds the love of his life.As to the humor, because of the writing, acting, and clothes, my Dad was convinced that the movie was set in England.  It took me a bit too.  It wasn't until the words Brooklyn and apartment were said a few times that the debate decisively ended.  The writing and delivery was very Monty Python: slapstick humor and intelligent riffs on life.  Plus, the comic delivery by the two leads was excellent.  I think Michelle Williams did an especially good job, considering I have never seen her play a character like this one.  She really lets loose her inner Nerd.  My favorite scene takes place the only time Cecil and Elliot are in the bedroom together (no not that kind of scene!).  I won't spoil it except to say words can't describe the laughter!  And that is why The Baxter is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",5,Release your inner geek,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2736,"['Oddly', 'enough', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'movie', 'Dad', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'think', 'same', 'things', 'are', 'funny', 'had', 'same', 'reaction', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'best', 'Baxters/Baxterettes', 'go', 'awkwardly', 'lives', 'So', 'much', 'one', 'cringe', 'Think', 'scenes', 'Office', 'British', 'American', 'versions', 'Baxters/', 'Baxterettes', 'are', 'so', 'earnest', 'pathetic', 'watching', 'car', 'accident', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'someone', 'would', 'act', 'way', 'guy', 'last', 'time', 'saying', 'up', 'late', 'was', 'finals', 'week', 'Business', 'school', 'A', 'guy', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'anything', 'beer', 'Two', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'dictionary', 'fun', 'When', 'will', 'madness', 'end', 'admit', 'point', 'was', 'worried', 'rest', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'writing', 'was', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'possible', 'Baxter', 'was', 'joke', 'hmmmmmm', 'Were', 'ones', 'not', 'getting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'happened', 'began', 'find', 'habits', 'mannerisms', 'endearing', 'thought', 'God', 'such', 'geeks', 'are', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'love', 'movie', 'home', 'points', 'someone', 'there', 'everyone', 'never', 'late', 'find', 'new', 'love', 'rekindle', 'old', 'passion', 'Elliot', 'Baxter', 'title', 'narrowly', 'missed', 'finding', 'love', 'life', 'several', 'times', 'old', 'flame', 'one', 'girlfriends', 'stolen', 'right', 'underneath', 'trying', 'find', 'love', 'could', 'be', 'sabatoging', 'Can', 'break', 'free', 'past', 'movie', 'interesting', 'study', 'coincidences', 'What', 'series', 'events', 'had', 'happen', 'just', 'right', 'sequence', 'someone', 'fall', 'love', 'get', 'dumped', 'run', 'old', 'flame', 'three', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'how', 'series', 'misadventures', 'coincidences', 'Eilliot', 'life', 'love', 'love', 'life.As', 'humor', 'writing', 'acting', 'clothes', 'Dad', 'was', 'convinced', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'England', 'took', 'bit', 'too', 'was', ""n't"", 'words', 'Brooklyn', 'apartment', 'were', 'said', 'few', 'times', 'debate', 'decisively', 'ended', 'writing', 'delivery', 'was', 'very', 'Monty', 'Python', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'intelligent', 'riffs', 'life', 'comic', 'delivery', 'two', 'leads', 'was', 'excellent', 'think', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'did', 'especially', 'good', 'job', 'considering', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'character', 'one', 'really', 'loose', 'inner', 'Nerd', 'favorite', 'scene', 'place', 'only', 'time', 'Cecil', 'Elliot', 'are', 'bedroom', 'together', 'not', 'kind', 'scene', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'say', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'laughter', 'why', 'Baxter', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",The Baxter

944959,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000BMY2K6,Cubist,"[6, 10]","The Baxter is about a nice guy named Elliot Sherman (Showalter). He's the kind of guy who doesn't get the girl in the movies. He reads the Dictionary for fun and is an accountant by trade (working for the second best firm in New York City no less) - it doesn't get much more ordinary than that. He is a nave, idealistic dreamer in the same vein as Miranda July's character in Me and You and Everyone We Know. The Baxter champions nice guys and the unsung heroes who may not be dynamic leading man material but fascinating in their own right.Michael Showalter is excellent as the ultimate nice guy/doormat. He walks through life with a perpetually cheery, glazed facial expression that is priceless. With his pursed lips and oblivious nature, he's like a live-action version of Charlie Brown. He has such an expressive face - ideal for all of his funny looks and reaction shots when something doesn't go his way: wide eyes when surprised and narrowed when suspicious.The always watchable Michelle Williams is absolutely endearing as Cecil the temp. Even though she is made to look mousy, her natural beauty and charisma come through. Her character is infinitely more interesting than Caroline and this is due in large part to Williams. There is something about her, an old fashioned quality in what her character wears, her inhibitions and her naivete that is refreshing in this day and age with actresses like Angelina Jolie who reveal too much so that there is no mystique to them. This makes them less interesting to watch.Five minutes into The Baxter and it already has you immersed in this fascinating and idiosyncratic world. You find yourself already caring about what happens to Elliot. He is instantly endearing and engaging. And this extends to other characters via extensive use of close-ups so that we can see them emoting - essential for a character-driven movie like this one. In the first five minutes it is readily apparent that is a wonderfully personal, independent movie.There is a brief ""Blooper Reel"" that features four scenes where actors blow their lines. It's amusing but hardly earth shattering.

You see, The Baxter is less of a romantic comedy that it is a romantic indie with some dry humor. But for what it lacks in a somewhat lackluster original story, the film makes up for with some great characters, some great scenes, and a splendid cast. The movie isn't overtly funny, but the humor derives from the characters, which makes it all the more funny when they do come around. For example, and spoiler warning, when Elliot finally conquers his 'Baxter' status and declares his love for his love, an old college friend of hers comes up to them at that very moment, knowing that this type of incident is what has messed him up before, Elliot runs after the guy chasing him away. Trust me, it's funnier when you actually see it.Overall, being a fan of Michael Showalter, I was pleased with what I found in a movie directed, written, and starring him. It's a good debut, and while I sadly don't expect we'll see another project like this from him again, it certainly speaks to his talents, both in playing the funny, and the serious emotional sides of the character. the movie may feel long at times, but it is worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of Showalter's.",4,I Do Like His Hat,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,1229,"['really', 'can', 'relate', 'main', 'character', 'see', 'Baxter', 'less', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'indie', 'dry', 'humor', 'what', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'original', 'story', 'film', 'up', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'scenes', 'splendid', 'cast', 'movie', ""n't"", 'overtly', 'funny', 'humor', 'characters', 'more', 'funny', 'when', 'do', 'come', 'around', 'example', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'when', 'Elliot', 'finally', ""'Baxter"", 'status', 'love', 'love', 'old', 'college', 'friend', 'hers', 'up', 'very', 'moment', 'knowing', 'type', 'incident', 'what', 'messed', 'up', 'before', 'Elliot', 'guy', 'chasing', 'away', 'Trust', 'funnier', 'when', 'actually', 'see', 'it.Overall', 'being', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Showalter', 'was', 'pleased', 'what', 'found', 'movie', 'directed', 'written', 'starring', 'good', 'debut', 'sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', ""'ll"", 'see', 'project', 'again', 'certainly', 'talents', 'playing', 'funny', 'serious', 'emotional', 'sides', 'character', 'movie', 'may', 'feel', 'long', 'times', 'watch', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Showalter']",The Baxter

While some of the absurdity associated with those projects is in place in ""The Baxter,"" for the most part, this is a sweet comedy in the vein of 70s/80s Woody Allen territory.Showalter plays Elliot Sherman, ""the baxter,"" a term used for the nice guy that always seems to lose the girl to the more passionate ""bad"" boy who pops up in romantic comedies.  Quite an original idea for a movie, many of the same cast members from ""Wet Hot American Summer"" (Michael Ian Black, Zak Orth, Elizabeth Banks, Joe LoTroglio, AD Miles) pop up in small supporting roles.  David Wain is also here doing his thing -- which lends itself to one of the funniest scenes in the film.  The great thing about ""The Baxter"" is that the absurd comedy aspects of the film never infringe on the sweet and serious nature of the story.  It's a fine balance of the two.The only complaints about the DVD is there are basically no special features aside from four brief ""blooper"" clips.

944963,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000BMY2K6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I went into ""The Baxter"" with lots of good will and moderate expectations. I believe Michael Showalter is a talented writer and performer with a distinct sense of comic absurdity. ""Stella,"" with all it's zany irreverence, is one of the more unique programs in recent years. And ""Wet Hot American Summer"" is absolute genius--one of the most underappreciated, robust, and take-no-prisoner's satire in memory. Many who accuse ""Wet Hot American Summer"" of being ""dumb"" comedy are missing just how astute this film is--it's as successful in many ways as ""Airplane!"" was (but without the audience).I knew ""The Baxter"" would represent the kinder, gentler side of Showalter--and playing the agreeable loser, he is genial and pleasant. He smartly surrounds himself with an able and attractive cast including Elizabeth Banks, Michelle Williams, Justin Theroux, and his partner in crime--Thomas Ian Black. An appealing bunch, this film has all the earmarks for success. It's pleasant and nice.It's a pretty conventional romantic comedy setup. ""The Baxter"" is a nice, shy guy chasing a woman who he can never have while ignoring his real soulmate. Done well, this tried and true formula has worked hundreds of time. It's a moderate success here--it just flows smoothly along all the expected pathways. It's pleasant and nice.The comedy is less about ""jokes"" than oddball quirkiness, but really nothing here is that ""quirky"" or fresh (certainly not if you watch a lot of movies and TV--quirky is getting harder to do because everyone's quirky). Because I liked the performers, I generally smiled at their antics. I can't say I laughed out loud but I watched the movie in a mild state of amusement.

944964,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BMY2K6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 2]","How many times have you seen a movie where the girl is about to marry the wrong guy and the right guy shows up at the last moment and stops the wedding from taking place?  I think ""The Graduate"" may well have been the first time I saw that particular commonplace of romantic comedy, but there are a few times that the formula is played with to good effect (""My Best Friend's Wedding"" comes to mind).  ""The Baxter"" is another attempt to take a new look at an old situation because it is really about the fellow left standing at the altar, a.k.a. the wrong guy.  Therefore, the ""Baxter"" is the guy who does not get the girl and this film from writer-director-actor Michael Showalter seeks to rectify that result.Showlater is Elliot Sherman, a CPA, whom we first meet when his wedding to Caroline Swann (Elizabeth Banks) is interrupted by her high school sweetheart, Bradley Lake (Justin Theroux), who has jetted in from Malta because he has a few things we wants to say to the woman in the wedding dress.  We then go back to the beginning, when Elliot met Caroline, only to have this immediately revised to slightly earlier that same day when Elliot met Cecil Mills (Michelle Williams), his temp secretary for the day.  Elliot and Cecil make a connection (they both are reading the dictionary for fun), but then Caroline walks in and he ends up dating and becoming engaged to her instead.  We know what he sees in her, but what she sees in him is not at all clear, but that is the way these stories go.  That would explain why their connection is made off screen, because it is necessary to get us from point A to point B (just like how King Kong gets from Skull Island to New York City in a cut rather than on that little boat).There are a series of flashbacks when we find out that Elliot has been the Baxter for a long time as we watch him lose the girl in high school, college, and graduate school.  So when Bradley shows up, having not seen Caroline in years, he knows what is coming.  Elliot tries to fight back, but he is a Baxter and therefore doomed.  But in this knowledge that what is going to happen is going to happen Elliot actually finds his salvation and when he go back to the beginning there is one rather significant addition in terms of what Elliot says before Bradley makes his grand entrance.This ends up being something of a surprise since given the prologue to the film I was really expecting ""The Baxter"" would focus on the aftermath of being left at the altar and how Elliot picks up the pieces and ends up finding true love.  Instead we go back to the beginning of Elliot's relationship with Caroline and watch the train wreck play out, but with a twist.  Clearly Caroline and Bradley are constrained to playing to the types they represent, which is why their characters are ultimately comic rather than tragic, but that is also the main reason that Cecil stands out as being a much better fit for Elliot.  Lots of people go to Dartmouth, but how many people read the dictionary as their choice for literature?  We know they are perfect for each other and she knows it, but Elliot is a bit slow because, after all, he is a Baxter.This 2005 film plays as more of a farce than a satire, and the paradox is that Elliot has to deserve his fate as a Baxter but somehow be able to break free of the role in the end.  That requires Showlater to try and have it both ways and have a lot of the good will we feel towards his character to be established by his circumstances rather than his characteristics.  I checked out this movie because of Michelle Williams and she is cute and quirky without becoming odd.  The other standout performance in the film is Peter Dinklage as a gay wedding planner named Benson Hedges.

944967,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B000BMY2K6,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[4, 7]","The BaxterThis is probably one of the most underrated films I've seen yet, considering that it's style is basically generic romantic comedy (meaning the makers underrated it themselves), it's gotten little to no viewership... I never even heard of it before I  picked it up off the wall (it was next in line).Anyway, you know all those movies about how the man and the woman love each other but can't figure it out, so the woman almost marries the wrong person before the man crashes the wedding and sweeps her away?  Well this is the story of the guy left at the altar, and his search for the ""right woman"" as well when his character is defined as the safe, content ""nice guy"" that women are supposed to erroneously try to marry when their lively romantic relationships go awry.  Basically that's the long way of saying that this guy is an accountant who spends his time reading the dictionary as a private pleasure, and now he realizes that he'd like to actually get the girl too.What's absolutely wonderful about this film is that Elliot knows that his problem is that he's such a harmless nice guy, but he knows that being a harmless nice guy is a really great thing to be if you don't take into account that that means losing a lot of relationships because women are more interested in romance risk-takers.  So he has to battle his own personality with his own personality while his friends give him TERRIBLE advice that sounds good (we've been there, now haven't we?), he surrounds himself with completely superficial people because superficiality is the only way he knows to fit in, and he totally doesn't notice the direct and not-so-subtle advances from the ""right girl"" who is, also, way too nice to take risks as well.In short, it's an absolutely delightful sort of aside in the whole romantic comedy industry, but still uses a lot of the tropes and techniques usual to the form to keep it simple and enjoyable for everyone.--PolarisDiB",5,An absolutely delightful sort of aside in the whole romantic comedy industry,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,1947,"['BaxterThis', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'considering', 'style', 'basically', 'generic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'meaning', 'makers', 'underrated', 'gotten', 'little', 'viewership', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'picked', 'up', 'wall', 'was', 'next', 'line', '.Anyway', 'know', 'movies', 'how', 'man', 'woman', 'love', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'woman', 'almost', 'wrong', 'person', 'man', 'wedding', 'away', 'Well', 'story', 'guy', 'left', 'altar', 'search', 'right', 'woman', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'character', 'defined', 'safe', 'content', 'nice', 'guy', 'women', 'are', 'supposed', 'erroneously', 'try', 'marry', 'when', 'lively', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'go', 'awry', 'Basically', 'long', 'way', 'saying', 'guy', 'accountant', 'who', 'time', 'reading', 'dictionary', 'private', 'pleasure', 'now', ""'d"", 'like', 'actually', 'get', 'girl', 'too.What', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Elliot', 'problem', 'such', 'harmless', 'nice', 'guy', 'being', 'harmless', 'nice', 'guy', 'really', 'great', 'thing', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'account', 'losing', 'lot', 'relationships', 'women', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'romance', 'risk-takers', 'battle', 'own', 'personality', 'own', 'personality', 'friends', 'give', 'TERRIBLE', 'advice', 'good', ""'ve"", 'been', 'there', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'completely', 'superficial', 'people', 'superficiality', 'only', 'way', 'fit', 'totally', ""n't"", 'notice', 'direct', 'not-so-subtle', 'advances', 'right', 'girl', 'who', 'also', 'way', 'too', 'nice', 'take', 'risks', 'well.In', 'short', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'sort', 'aside', 'whole', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'industry', 'still', 'lot', 'tropes', 'techniques', 'usual', 'form', 'keep', 'simple', 'enjoyable', 'everyone.', 'PolarisDiB']",The Baxter
944968,AOC6CQ1MHA8UD,B000BMY2K6,P. Taegel,"[4, 6]","The Baxter is Michael Showalter's exegesis on the chronic leavability of guys who get ditched at the altar.  Is it fate?  Pure lack of game?  Or do these guys just have a knack for clinging onto women fate has earmarked for another?Fortunately, Showalter has seen fit not to inflict upon us yet another blithe romp where the nerdy guy finally gets the clue to ditch the horned-rims for contacts and all of a sudden he's the next coming of Brad Pitt.  And the result is a quirky comedy with an original and fresh perspective of a classic storyline.Where the film neatly avoids falling the course of a modern Pygmalion myth, however, the inescapable notion that our Baxter, Eliot (Showalter), is playing a role in someone else's story haunts the film, leaving us somewhat apathetic to whether or not his bride will ultimately abandon him or not.  While Eliot blusters and fumes about the reappearance of his bride-to-be's ex-flame, Bradley (Justin Theroux), we can't help but wish we were seeing Bradley's campaign to reclaim his lost love.  After all, it's clear that Eliot's redemption from Baxterhood lies not in his remedial machismo, but rather in his chick-picker.  As it would be problematic to watch a war movie about a guy who's (although unwittingly) on a mission to help out the Third Reich, it's little more compelling to watch a film about a guy who spends the whole time fighting for a woman who's wrong for him.  By the time Eliot clues in to the identity of his soul's lost love, the film has been so preoccupied with the wrong girl that there's barely enough time to tap the right one on the shoulder, much less fight for her.In the meantime, some deftly penned characters, enthusiastic performances and truly funny moments fuel the underpowered storyline.  Showalter infuses enough intelligence into Eliot to make him sympathetic, and a parade of great supporting talent makes gems out of several moments.  As Showalter himself admits, ""The best line is always an improvised line,"" and The Baxter definitely has its fair share.  And it is in these moments that The Baxter tastes satisfying in the theatre.

944970,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000BMY2K6,Robert Moore,"[13, 15]","Once in a while I'll see a movie with minimal expectations, and end up being utterly delighted.  This is one of those movies.  The film is the feature film directorial debut of Michael Showalter, who has previously popped up a number of places on TV and film such as THE DAILY SHOW and STELLA SHORTS.  Here is excels on in all three creative tasks.  I firmly believe that this is one of those ""small"" comedies that will build a significant fan base over the course of time.  It is unorthodox in that the lead romantic character truly is not especially attractive or appealing.  We've all seen comedies in which the leading man was supposed to be unattractive, but in fact was a pretty nice looking guy pretending to be unattractive.  Not here:  Michael Showalter might be an extraordinarily nice guy, but here he simply is not hot.  He isn't merely unattractive; he has terribly posture, moves awkwardly, and dresses horribly.  Much of this is achieved by make up, wardrobe, or acting, but the point is that when we look at him we really do see an unattractive guy, and this is crucial to the film's success.See, Elliot Sherman, Showalter's character, is a Baxter.  As the movie explains at the beginning, a Baxter is the guy in romantic comedies who is always left by the girl at the altar when she is reunited with her true love.  Ralph Bellamy in HIS GIRL FRIDAY is a Baxter.  Bill Pullman in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is a Baxter.  In other words, they are always the guy you know the girl won't end up with.  In THE BAXTER, Elliot meets the very pretty Caroline Swann, whom he meets through his quintessentially Baxter job of accountant.  Inexplicably, they hit it off, get engaged, and plan their marriage.  Inevitably, Caroline's high school sweetheart reenters the picture and we all wonder if this signals the end of their engagement and the reassertion of Elliot's Baxter-hood.  Meanwhile, at the height of his anxiety over the reappearance of the old boyfriend, Elliot meets Cecil, an unpolished but extremely cute temp he met the same day he met Caroline.  Of course, as he talks with her and tells Cecil all about his troubled relationship, everyone in the house desires him to get together with Cecil rather than Caroline.  Michelle Williams, who is best known for her role in DAWSON'S CREEK, does a great job of looking as mousy and unattractive as it is possible for her to look, though her irrepressibly cute face and great smile is impossible to hide.  With her dark and short, she bears a striking resemblance to Janeane Garafalo (which I definitely mean as a compliment-Janeane has gotten a lot of mileage out of being unglamorous, but she really does have one of the great smiles on the planet).There is a great supporting cast of mainly unknown performers.  Most will know Paul Rudd from films like CLUELESS and his other work, but many will be unfamiliar to most.  Michael Ian Black was funny as Elliot's close friend who was a bit clueless in his own way, but the best supporting job by far was by the dwarf actor Peter Dinklage, who was great in THE STATION AGENT.  Most performances by dwarfs are funny primarily being performed by a dwarf (though Tony Cox is a notable exception).  Dinklage, by contrast, is quite funny here, as much by his subtle gestures.  He had some great visual reactions to things that happened in his scenes, and the way he walked back and forth in front of Elliot's building was very funny.  Casting dwarf actors is always difficult, but I hope he finds more roles in the future.  I also like the way that he plays his roles with dignity.  You never get the sense with him that anyone is making fun of him.I saw this at a preview in Chicago, and the audience laughed hard all the way through the film.  I think most film goers will do so.  I was absolutely stunned when I saw that Roger Ebert gave the film two stars.  More and more over the years I've come to distrust his assessments of movies.  He not only underrates good movies; he gives absurdly good ratings to awful movies.  Remember his 3-star rating of GARFIELD?  I'm not sure how to account for the growing quirkiness of his ratings.  I've wondered about the conditions he sees films.  He may receive screeners and watch movies primarily on DVD.  If that is the case, he could have seen this without an audience.  In his review he compares THE BAXTER poorly to A 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN, which I think is the weaker of the two films by a considerable margin.  And the audience laughed much harder at THE BAXTER.  So, I strongly urge anyone wanting to see a good comedy to ignore Ebert and check this out.  I promise that very few people are going to be disappointed.",5,A nice comedy that creates variations on familiar themes,1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,4669,"['Once', 'while', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movie', 'minimal', 'expectations', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'utterly', 'delighted', 'one', 'movies', 'film', 'feature', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Michael', 'Showalter', 'who', 'previously', 'popped', 'up', 'number', 'places', 'TV', 'film', 'such', 'DAILY', 'SHOW', 'STELLA', 'SHORTS', 'Here', 'excels', 'three', 'creative', 'tasks', 'firmly', 'believe', 'one', 'small', 'comedies', 'will', 'build', 'significant', 'fan', 'base', 'course', 'time', 'unorthodox', 'lead', 'romantic', 'character', 'truly', 'not', 'especially', 'attractive', 'appealing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'comedies', 'leading', 'man', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'unattractive', 'fact', 'was', 'pretty', 'nice', 'looking', 'guy', 'pretending', 'be', 'unattractive', 'Not', 'here', 'Michael', 'Showalter', 'might', 'be', 'extraordinarily', 'nice', 'guy', 'here', 'simply', 'not', 'hot', ""n't"", 'merely', 'unattractive', 'terribly', 'posture', 'moves', 'awkwardly', 'horribly', 'Much', 'achieved', 'make', 'up', 'wardrobe', 'acting', 'point', 'when', 'look', 'really', 'do', 'see', 'unattractive', 'guy', 'crucial', 'film', 'success.See', 'Elliot', 'Sherman', 'Showalter', 'character', 'Baxter', 'movie', 'beginning', 'Baxter', 'guy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'who', 'always', 'left', 'girl', 'altar', 'when', 'reunited', 'true', 'love', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'HIS', 'GIRL', 'FRIDAY', 'Baxter', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'SLEEPLESS', 'IN', 'SEATTLE', 'Baxter', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'always', 'guy', 'know', 'girl', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'THE', 'BAXTER', 'Elliot', 'very', 'pretty', 'Caroline', 'Swann', 'whom', 'quintessentially', 'Baxter', 'job', 'accountant', 'Inexplicably', 'hit', 'off', 'get', 'engaged', 'plan', 'marriage', 'Inevitably', 'Caroline', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'picture', 'wonder', 'end', 'engagement', 'reassertion', 'Elliot', 'Baxter-hood', 'Meanwhile', 'height', 'anxiety', 'reappearance', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'Elliot', 'Cecil', 'unpolished', 'extremely', 'cute', 'temp', 'met', 'same', 'day', 'met', 'Caroline', 'course', 'tells', 'Cecil', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'everyone', 'house', 'get', 'together', 'Cecil', 'rather', 'Caroline', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'DAWSON', 'CREEK', 'great', 'job', 'looking', 'mousy', 'unattractive', 'possible', 'look', 'irrepressibly', 'cute', 'face', 'great', 'smile', 'impossible', 'hide', 'dark', 'short', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Janeane', 'Garafalo', 'definitely', 'mean', 'compliment-Janeane', 'gotten', 'lot', 'mileage', 'being', 'unglamorous', 'really', 'have', 'one', 'great', 'smiles', 'planet', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'mainly', 'unknown', 'performers', 'Most', 'will', 'know', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'films', 'CLUELESS', 'other', 'work', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'Michael', 'Ian', 'Black', 'was', 'funny', 'Elliot', 'close', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'bit', 'clueless', 'own', 'way', 'best', 'supporting', 'job', 'far', 'was', 'dwarf', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'STATION', 'AGENT', 'Most', 'performances', 'dwarfs', 'are', 'funny', 'primarily', 'being', 'performed', 'dwarf', 'Tony', 'Cox', 'notable', 'exception', 'Dinklage', 'contrast', 'quite', 'funny', 'here', 'much', 'subtle', 'gestures', 'had', 'great', 'visual', 'reactions', 'things', 'happened', 'scenes', 'way', 'walked', 'back', 'forth', 'front', 'Elliot', 'building', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'Casting', 'dwarf', 'actors', 'always', 'difficult', 'hope', 'more', 'roles', 'future', 'also', 'way', 'roles', 'dignity', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'anyone', 'making', 'fun', 'him.I', 'saw', 'preview', 'Chicago', 'audience', 'laughed', 'hard', 'way', 'film', 'think', 'most', 'film', 'goers', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stunned', 'when', 'saw', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'More', 'more', 'years', ""'ve"", 'come', 'distrust', 'assessments', 'movies', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'movies', 'absurdly', 'good', 'ratings', 'awful', 'movies', 'Remember', '3-star', 'rating', 'GARFIELD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'account', 'growing', 'quirkiness', 'ratings', ""'ve"", 'wondered', 'conditions', 'films', 'may', 'receive', 'screeners', 'watch', 'movies', 'primarily', 'DVD', 'case', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'audience', 'review', 'THE', 'BAXTER', 'poorly', '40-YEAR', 'OLD', 'VIRGIN', 'think', 'weaker', 'two', 'films', 'considerable', 'margin', 'audience', 'laughed', 'much', 'harder', 'THE', 'BAXTER', 'So', 'strongly', 'urge', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'see', 'good', 'comedy', 'ignore', 'Ebert', 'check', 'promise', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Baxter
944971,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000BMY2K6,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 2]","A ""Baxter"" is basically a loser, the guy who not only never gets the girl, but has to hear others applaud when he loses her to hero of the story.  And since ""getting the girl"" is basically the same as ""getting the story"", the ""Baxter"" is fated to become the footnote in the movie.  The conceit behind ""The Baxter"" is that an entire romantic comedy has been written around the genre's most disposable character type (the guy that the movie's hero beats out in the last 5 minutes of the movie).  Unfortunately, the conceit is something of a Baxter itself.The story follows our Baxter, Eliot Wilbur Sherman in the few weeks before his doomed marriage to an unbelievably beautiful, intelligent and successful woman named Caroline (Elizabeth Banks - crazy Beth from ""40 year Old Virgin"").  The script doesn't do much to explain how Eliot managed to land Caroline (or is that ""how Caroline got stuck with Eliot?"") because there's no point to that.  We pretty much know how the movie is going to end - the script beats us to the punch by opening the story at the altar, when Eliot does indeed lose Caroline to Bradley, her former too-good-to-be-true boyfriend.  The twist is that the story also offers us an offbeat musician named Cecil who's fated to become Eliot's true love once he's realized that there is life after Baxter-hood.  The story then re-winds back to those precious weeks before the wedding when we see Bradley slowly reenter Caroline's life and lay the seeds for his triumph at Eliot's altar.The problem with this flick: like Eliot, it's sort of a Baxter itself.  As the story progresses, Bradley edges Eliot out of the way, and since the story is told mostly from his POV, it's soon as marginalized as Eliot.  It didn't take long before I began to feel as if there was some other movie going on somewhere else telling the exact same story from Brad's POV.  Unfortunately, unlike Eliot, ""The Baxter"" doesn't have a Cecil of its own, a redeemer of a sort to save it from its incipient Baxterhood.""The Baxter"" unfortunately is successful only in proving just why Baxters shouldn't get the girl or our attention.",3,The story is its own worst Baxter,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,2119,"['Baxter', 'basically', 'loser', 'guy', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'never', 'girl', 'hear', 'others', 'applaud', 'when', 'hero', 'story', 'getting', 'girl', 'basically', 'same', 'getting', 'story', 'Baxter', 'fated', 'become', 'footnote', 'movie', 'conceit', 'Baxter', 'entire', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'been', 'written', 'genre', 'most', 'disposable', 'character', 'type', 'guy', 'movie', 'hero', 'out', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'conceit', 'something', 'Baxter', 'itself.The', 'story', 'Baxter', 'Eliot', 'Wilbur', 'Sherman', 'few', 'weeks', 'doomed', 'marriage', 'unbelievably', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'successful', 'woman', 'named', 'Caroline', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'crazy', 'Beth', '40', 'year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'script', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'explain', 'how', 'Eliot', 'managed', 'land', 'Caroline', 'how', 'Caroline', 'got', 'stuck', 'Eliot', 'point', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'going', 'end', 'script', 'punch', 'opening', 'story', 'altar', 'when', 'Eliot', 'indeed', 'lose', 'Caroline', 'Bradley', 'former', 'too-good-to-be-true', 'boyfriend', 'twist', 'story', 'also', 'offbeat', 'musician', 'named', 'Cecil', 'who', 'fated', 'become', 'Eliot', 'true', 'love', 'realized', 'life', 'Baxter-hood', 'story', 'then', 'back', 'precious', 'weeks', 'wedding', 'when', 'see', 'Bradley', 'slowly', 'reenter', 'Caroline', 'life', 'lay', 'seeds', 'triumph', 'Eliot', 'altar.The', 'problem', 'flick', 'Eliot', 'sort', 'Baxter', 'story', 'Bradley', 'Eliot', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'mostly', 'POV', 'soon', 'as', 'marginalized', 'Eliot', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'before', 'began', 'feel', 'was', 'other', 'movie', 'going', 'somewhere', 'else', 'telling', 'exact', 'same', 'story', 'Brad', 'POV', 'Unfortunately', 'Eliot', 'Baxter', ""n't"", 'have', 'Cecil', 'own', 'redeemer', 'sort', 'save', 'incipient', 'Baxterhood', 'Baxter', 'unfortunately', 'successful', 'only', 'proving', 'just', 'why', 'Baxters', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'girl', 'attention']",The Baxter
