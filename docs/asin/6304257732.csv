What more can be said about a man that has won 11 All-Ireland and 9 World championships??? (Eat your heart out Michael Flatley!) This man is the most elegant and beautiful Irish dancer recorded thus far. If you'd like to learn from the best, and witness this incredible talent at his peak, buy this video! I would also recommend, of course, Riverdance: NYC, and Dancing On Dangerous Ground, co-starring the always fantastic Jean Butler,The dances on this video are relatively simple for a beginner and really fun to learn. I use them to work out! You'd be surprised how quickly you get your heartrate up by doing them.
