He is funny as usual, but I was hoping for a few scenes from the Carol Burnett show.

Tim's strength is his physical comedy & spontaneous witty ad-lib. He also does best when another actor tries to hold in a laugh at his jokes & that gives Tim confidence to do what he does best & go off the script. That barely happens once in this hour program when a ringing phone didn't happen & he pretending to be psychic (I forget) & the other actor died laughing. I wished Tim kept going, but he went back to the script. All stage skit material from different variety shows, many of them having Tim play a character called ""Dag Hartford"" as a jockey, car driver, hippie, caveman, etc. It's the same character, the type that's slow, thick-headed, etc. But nowhere near as good as his days on Carol.
