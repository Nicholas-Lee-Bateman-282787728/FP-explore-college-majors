1377108,A2I12PBNLB6DRQ,B003Z94WBG,BeastNYC,"[3, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Hunt To Kill was 100 times better than Stone Cold's previous movie (The Stranger). I Definitely recommend Hunt To Kill to all Stone Cold fans and WWE fans. HTK is a mash-up of Cliffhanger and First Blood. You have to be patient and wait until Steve Austin starts hunting! Yes, the movie may start out slow as hell, but give it a chance. The final two fights at the end are both awesome! Director Keoni Waxman did a decent job.Steve Austin plays Jim Rhodes, who is a border patrol agent. JR (ironic that he has the same initials as Austin's real life friend Jim Ross) knows the terrain and is at home in the wilderness (Gabe Walker + John Rambo = Jim Rhodes). The film begins with partners Steve Austin and Eric Roberts about to take down a crystal meth lab. It goes wrong, and Rhodes loses his partner. FFWD >>Jim's daughter always manages to get into trouble and so she is in the sheriff's office ""At The Wrong Place, At The Wrong Time."" Because a small crew of criminals are after their money that went missing in the area. They need someone to guide them. Jim Rhodes gets a call from the sheriff so he heads to the office not knowing what awaits. Rhodes agrees to guide the thugs, but the main villain Banks shot the sheriff.So off they go into the woods ... One of Bank's henchmen tries to molest Jim's daughter Kim which leads to Stone Cold's first fight. It was short, but an okay skirmish none the less. The Main Bad Guy Banks is an idiot so he kills his goon (Banks will later commit another even more moronic blunder). FFWD >> They find the money and of course, GUESS WHO GOES TO GET IT? Yeah Jim Rhodes, just like Gabe Walker in CLIFFHANGER. So, Jim retrieves the $ and then Banks shoots him down into the river. Now, the young Kim Rhodes becomes the guide. So, she purposefully leads them astray.Once again, one of the goons lays a hand on Kim. Banks' female companion Dominika takes exception which leads to a scuffle between her and the goon. She kicks his ass, breaks his leg and the posse decide to leave him behind. Later on, they get hungry and guess who was carrying the food? Yep, the guy they left behind (Geary).FFWD >> Stone Cold catches up with Geary and finds out which direction they went (Austin shoots him up with arrows after wards). Austin catches up to his enemies which leads to Stone Cold Fight 2. Steve Austin vs. Gary Daniels (from The Expendables). It was a good fight scene between Jim Rhodes and Jensen. They have a stick fight or a tree branch fight. Austin finishes him off by sticking the branch through Jensen's chest and he says ""Stick Around"" just like Schwarzenegger did in PREDATOR. It was cool to see Austin vs. Daniels because they were on the same side in THE EXPENDABLES and now in HUNT TO KILL, they are enemies.FFWD >> Austin catches up to Banks and Dominika (last 2 villains left). J.R. throws a wooden spear at Dominika and then she is dead. So, now it is Rhodes vs. Banks, but his daughter is in the way (think Arnold vs the main villain in TRUE LIES).Banks escapes, then he pistol whips Kim and takes off on a motor bike. Austin catches up to Banks which leads to the FINAL FIGHT. The last fight is COOL. I don't want to spoil the way Jim Rhodes kills Banks, but I will say that Banks is very persistent. At the end Banks taunts Rhodes by saying ""you can't kill me!, you can't kill me!!"" & Austin says ... ""When I Hunt, I Hunt to KILL!!!"" Jim Rhodes then proceeds to kill Banks in a unique and special way!Overall I would give ""Hunt To Kill"" a 7 out of 10. Yeah, the budget was low and the film starts out real slow. But once Steve Austin starts hunting, the movie picks up the pace!! Hunt To Kill is > The Stranger. It is not better than Damage or The Condemned.",3,Cliffhanger: First Blood (Mash-up).

Austin plays a Border Patrol officer that loses a partner.  A few years later his daughter is kidnapped and he must escort a group of dangerous robbers to recover their money and get them to the Canadian border to free her.  It becomes obvious they will kill anyone so he must focus on killing them before they kill his daughter.  The movie has a good pace and some decent actors as the group of outlaws.

What's not to like?NOTE:  Minor spoilersCasting was ""five star"" for the movie.  Steve Austin plays Jim Rhodes - macho good guy and single dad - and Marie Avgeropoulos plays his snotty, know-it-all teenage daughter, Kim Rhodes (I felt like putting a gag on her myself at times).  Gil Bellows plays Banks, super bad guy, and Emilie Ullerup plays Dominika, his nasty mean girlfriend.  All the other characters are mainly bad guys and they are all good at being bad.One small complaint I had was location where the movie was shot.  It was supposed to be Montana but didn't look like Montana at all to me.  Lush, green, coastal is what I saw and I found out it was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. The scenery was gorgeous, dandy cinematography but it wasn't Montana.  Too bad because parts of Montana are just as beautiful.Story was fairly simplistic.  Bad guys rob casino, double cross each other and then chase the one bad guy who got away with the bearer bonds.  They end up in Montana and by accident, take Kim Rhodes captive.  Well...you just know that Jim Rhodes isn't going to stand for that.  So the rest of the movie is Rhodes getting rid of bad guys and protecting his daughter.  It's a simplistic formula, one that's been used many times, but Steve Austin does a righteous job of kicking ass.In this type of movie, you DO have to suspend your sense of belief sometimes (slides down cliffs and an oh-so-convenient backpack).  Jim Rhodes must be the toughest, luckiest guy alive to live through his ordeals but...it is a movie and who wants true to life all the time?  Not me.I enjoyed Austin inDamagetoo.  So if you like Steve Austin, try that one too.NOTE:  There is violence in this movie and references to rape.  So, in other words, probably not the best movie for the little kiddos.",4,"'When I hunt, I hunt to kill.'",1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1903,"['Watching', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'movies', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine', 'Rough', 'tough', 'bloody', 'usually', 'gore', 'fest', 'What', 'not', 'like', 'NOTE', 'Minor', 'spoilersCasting', 'was', 'five', 'star', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Jim', 'Rhodes', 'macho', 'good', 'guy', 'single', 'dad', 'Marie', 'Avgeropoulos', 'snotty', 'know-it-all', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Kim', 'Rhodes', 'felt', 'putting', 'gag', 'myself', 'times', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'Banks', 'super', 'bad', 'guy', 'Emilie', 'Ullerup', 'Dominika', 'nasty', 'mean', 'girlfriend', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'mainly', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'good', 'being', 'bad.One', 'small', 'complaint', 'had', 'was', 'location', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Montana', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'Montana', 'Lush', 'green', 'coastal', 'what', 'saw', 'found', 'was', 'filmed', 'Vancouver', 'British', 'Columbia', 'scenery', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'dandy', 'cinematography', 'was', ""n't"", 'Montana', 'Too', 'bad', 'parts', 'Montana', 'are', 'just', 'beautiful.Story', 'was', 'fairly', 'simplistic', 'Bad', 'rob', 'casino', 'double', 'cross', 'other', 'then', 'chase', 'one', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'away', 'bearer', 'bonds', 'end', 'up', 'Montana', 'accident', 'take', 'Kim', 'Rhodes', 'captive', 'Well', 'just', 'know', 'Jim', 'Rhodes', ""n't"", 'going', 'stand', 'rest', 'movie', 'Rhodes', 'getting', 'rid', 'bad', 'guys', 'protecting', 'daughter', 'simplistic', 'formula', 'one', 'been', 'used', 'many', 'times', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'righteous', 'job', 'kicking', 'ass.In', 'type', 'movie', 'DO', 'have', 'suspend', 'sense', 'belief', 'sometimes', 'slides', 'down', 'cliffs', 'oh-so-convenient', 'backpack', 'Jim', 'Rhodes', 'must', 'be', 'toughest', 'luckiest', 'guy', 'alive', 'live', 'ordeals', 'movie', 'who', 'true', 'life', 'time', 'Not', 'me.I', 'enjoyed', 'Austin', 'inDamagetoo', 'So', 'like', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'try', 'one', 'too.NOTE', 'violence', 'movie', 'references', 'rape', 'So', 'other', 'words', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'little', 'kiddos']",N/A

1377114,AR1UCBP9URG82,B003Z94WBG,Christopher Mills,"[11, 12]","I wasn't terribly impressed with the last Anchor Bay DTV action flick starring former wrestler ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, THE STRANGER, but as I'm always up for some testosterone-fueled cinematic mayhem, I decided to give the latest Austin vehicle, HUNT TO KILL (2010) a spin anyway.I'm glad I did.Austin plays a Border Patrol Agent named Jim Rhodes. After a bitter divorce that leaves him raising his teenage daughter Kim (Marie Avgeropoulis) alone and the brutal murder of his partner (Eric Roberts, picking up a check for a quick cameo), Rhodes accepts a promotion that finds him stationed in Northern Montana. But his quiet life in the woods is upset when a band of ruthless heist artists led by a sociopath named Banks (Gil Bellows, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, LOVE & A .45) roll into the neighborhood with a fortune in stolen bearer bonds. They take his daughter hostage, and coerce him into leading them through the wilderness and over the Canadian border. Of course, it isn't long before there's conflict and falling outs among the crooks, and the opportunity for a little random Rambo-styled mayhem on Stone Cold's part.HUNT TO KILL, despite the blandly generic title and somewhat over-familiar plotline, is a terrific low-budget B-action film. Austin is surprisingly effective in the lead role, exhibiting some unexpected bits of human emotion along with the expected brute force. The cast is better than average for the genre, with Bellows turning in a fine, sly turn as the leader of the crooks, and British martial arts star Gary Daniels (THE EXPENDABLES, BLOODFIST IV) making a formidable physical opponent for the hulking Austin. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA vets Michael Hogan and Donnelly Rhodes appear in brief cameos, while Emilie Ullerup of SyFy's SANCTUARY (and a few GALACTICAs) portrays a sexy, felonious femme fatale.The direction by Keoni Waxman is well-paced and engaging, and he makes good use of his cast and locations. The gorgeous, dangerous Canadian wilderness is captured in all its majesty by cinematographer Tom Harting and the score by Michael Plowman is excellent. The script isn't particularly original, but there are a few good twists, a couple of interesting characters, some intentional humor, and plenty of action set-pieces.The stuntwork is excellent, and the action is extremely well-shot and edited. The standout scene is the inevitable throw-down between Austin and Daniels, and when it finally occurs, it proves to be worth the wait. The fight is well-staged and clearly photographed, without the now-passe shaky camerawork, rapid editing and MATRIX-y computer crap that is usually employed to obscure bad choreography. No, this is a duel of mock-combat titans and truly a joy to behold.Anchor Bay's DVD of HUNT TO KILL sports a pristine, razor-sharp 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer and a very robust Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. The only bonus features are an audio commentary by director Keoni Waxman and actor Michael Eklund, a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette, and a trailer.HUNT TO KILL isn't an action classic, but it's a damned good manly entertainment, with plenty of thrills, spills and a couple of big explosions. Fans of B-action flicks should definitely give it a spin.

From there, Rhodes is forced to lead the band of criminals throught the wilderness with so many issues being dealt with such as the villians turning on each other, his daughter being held hostage while she's still having issues & conflict with him, and just trying to survive in the wild.Most of the action in this movie consist of using weapons (shooting weapons like guns & a crossbow) along with an explosion & some stunts but there are two fights with one being between Rhodes & Banks along with one of two mini reunions from the ""Expendables"" movie with Austin's character fighting Gary Daniels' character of Jensen.  Your also treated to another ""Expendables"" reunion in the beginning of the movie between Steve Austin & a cameo made by Eric Roberts.  Overall I enjoyed this more than his previous DVD flick ""The Stranger"" but that doesn't say much as the plot was very basic but some of the characters were too ""cartoonish"" for my taste & none of the action here really got an emotion out me unlike Austin's previous roles in ""The Expendables"" , ""The Condemded"", or ""Damaged.""

I thought going in that this was going to be different but it turned out pretty good. Sure this is not as great as the film he did previous to this one called ""Damage"" but still it is good. I have always been a fan of these types of flicks so of course I should have known I would like this. Plus three guys from ""The Expendables"" are in this film so that is cool.The film follows Jim Rhodes who is a border patrol agent in Texas who loses his partner when they go into a situation without backup. So now he lives in Montana with his daughter trying to forget all that had happened. But a gang of criminals are in his town looking for a former member of their group who screwed them out of their last score. So while in town they kill the sheriff and take Rhodes and his daughter hostage and make them lead them through the forest looking for their former partner. Now Rhodes has to find a way to keep his daughter safe and get them out of this situation without getting killed.This is of course a straight to DVD low budget affair so it does not have the production value of Austin's ""The Condemned"" but it still looks very good. Plus I just love the story here although it has been done before; still I always enjoy these types of flicks. Austin is great at this action type flick and has a good charismatic personality to carry it. The villains and his daughter are all great here as well but at times some seem a bit over the type but still it is fun to watch. All these personalities in the woods trying not to kill each other, and then very much trying to makes for a fun watch.The action here is really fun and great to just chill and watch, although sometimes it is a bit much at times. Not that I didn't like it but Austin's second fall is a bit much after the first time he falls down the side of a cliff. Other than that it is a fun shoot em up and slugfest B action flick. Keoni Waxman direction is great here as he knows how to shoot this beautiful forest. He keeps the pace quick and the action fast and used Frank Hannah's script well.Austin is excellent here and that always helps when the lead is someone who can carry a flick. I really enjoyed this one although I would say it is not his best film. Still I would highly recommend this flick to any action film fan or fan o Austin.

1377125,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B003Z94WBG,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","It's a good thing that Steve Austin quit working with WWE Films. Sure, some of his recent fare was helplessly bad, but a film like this proves that he's up for fighting his way into the ranks of quality action heroes even if he has to begin with the bare minimum. ""Hunt to Kill"" is a bit more than that, but it's an excellent example of what can be done with a talented and underrated cast, a semi-talented director, and a great setting to shoot a film in. What we have here is a combination ofCliffhangerandFirst Bloodproduced on a micro budget but undeniably cool and competent despite its flaws and a great all-around vehicle for the former wrestling superstar.The story: four years after losing his partner in a drug bust gone wrong, ex-border patrol officer Jim Rhodes (Austin) is still trying to put himself together while living in the forested regions of Montana. His ill-conceived vacation with his daughter (Marie Avgeropoulos,I Love You, Beth Cooper) takes a turn for the dangerous when they're taken captive by a group of robbers (headed by Gil Bellows,The Shawshank Redemption) who need them to navigate through the forest to find a backstabbing cohort who's made off with their ill-gotten gains (Michael Hogan,Battlestar Galactica). To save himself and his child, Jim will need to rekindle his killer instinct...Director Keoni Waxman's previous two outings starring Steven Seagal fell flat in my book, but much to my surprise, he pulls off a thoroughly exciting and enjoyable thriller with this one, transcending several commonplace DTV snafus and really getting a lot out of his cast and their filming environment. Austin in particular is utilized well: though not a conventional action hero, he's game to performing most of his own stunts (even some of the rappelling), serviceable in his fight scenes, and light years ahead guys like Van Damme and Statham when it comes to dramatic bits. This one plays more like a suspense movie than an actioneer and Austin is up to the task alongside fellowExpendablesalumni Eric Roberts as his doomed partner and Gary Daniels as a lethal enforcer of the criminal gang: in acting and fight, respectively, they're the top of the cast and, despite their limited interaction, display excellent chemistry with Austin.With that said, the movie does have a definite weakness in its script. Though it possesses the workings of and layout of a decent thriller, the antagonists have been written as just about the sorriest group of villains you've ever seen: guys like Michael ""Geary"" Eklund (House of the Dead) and Adrian ""Crab"" Holmes (White Noise 2) are respectively annoying and foolish beyond all common sense to the point of turning their teammates against them, Gil Bellows tries way too hard to come across as the 'crazy & dangerous' type, and Emilie ""Dominika"" Ullerup (Sanctuary) has been written as a tough chick but really only seems a few steps away from Tara Reid in terms of persona. Additionally, there's an uncomfortable and thoroughly un-heroic scene when Rhodes, having turned a ""Rambo"", interrogates and kills Michael Eklund's character, who was the least malicious among the group of bad guys and absolutely helpless at the time of his murder.Austin and Daniels have a particularly awesome fight in which both performers match their respective fighting styles against eachother with neither looking inferior or less impressive than the other, and later Austin takes on Gil Bellows in a more conventional brawl wherein the latter shows himself to be just about one of the most invincible villains ever. That's the extent of the film's real action content, but amazingly, it's been so strategically placed in the movie that it doesn't feel deficient. Again, this really is more of an adventure-thriller than an action flick, but darn if it isn't a pretty good one. It's a feather in the hat of both the star and director, albeit a flawed one, but fans of both won't be too disappointed in giving it a watch.",3,"""He's like the Davey Crockett of Border Patrol or something""",1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,3970,"['good', 'thing', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'quit', 'working', 'WWE', 'Films', 'Sure', 'recent', 'fare', 'was', 'helplessly', 'bad', 'film', 'up', 'fighting', 'way', 'ranks', 'quality', 'action', 'heroes', 'even', 'begin', 'bare', 'minimum', 'Hunt', 'Kill', 'bit', 'more', 'excellent', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'talented', 'underrated', 'cast', 'semi-talented', 'director', 'great', 'setting', 'shoot', 'film', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'combination', 'ofCliffhangerandFirst', 'Bloodproduced', 'micro', 'budget', 'undeniably', 'cool', 'competent', 'flaws', 'great', 'all-around', 'vehicle', 'former', 'wrestling', 'superstar.The', 'story', 'four', 'years', 'losing', 'partner', 'drug', 'bust', 'gone', 'wrong', 'ex-border', 'patrol', 'officer', 'Jim', 'Rhodes', 'Austin', 'still', 'trying', 'put', 'together', 'living', 'forested', 'regions', 'Montana', 'ill-conceived', 'vacation', 'daughter', 'Marie', 'Avgeropoulos', 'Love', 'Beth', 'Cooper', 'turn', 'dangerous', 'when', ""'re"", 'taken', 'captive', 'group', 'robbers', 'headed', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'who', 'need', 'navigate', 'forest', 'find', 'backstabbing', 'cohort', 'who', 'made', 'off', 'ill-gotten', 'gains', 'Michael', 'Hogan', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'save', 'child', 'Jim', 'will', 'need', 'rekindle', 'killer', 'instinct', 'Director', 'Keoni', 'Waxman', 'previous', 'two', 'outings', 'starring', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'fell', 'flat', 'book', 'much', 'surprise', 'thoroughly', 'exciting', 'enjoyable', 'thriller', 'one', 'transcending', 'several', 'commonplace', 'DTV', 'snafus', 'really', 'getting', 'lot', 'cast', 'filming', 'environment', 'Austin', 'particular', 'utilized', 'well', 'not', 'conventional', 'action', 'hero', 'game', 'performing', 'most', 'own', 'stunts', 'even', 'rappelling', 'serviceable', 'fight', 'scenes', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'guys', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Statham', 'when', 'dramatic', 'bits', 'one', 'more', 'suspense', 'movie', 'actioneer', 'Austin', 'up', 'task', 'fellowExpendablesalumni', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'doomed', 'partner', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'lethal', 'enforcer', 'criminal', 'gang', 'acting', 'fight', 'respectively', ""'re"", 'top', 'cast', 'limited', 'interaction', 'display', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'Austin.With', 'said', 'movie', 'have', 'definite', 'weakness', 'script', 'workings', 'layout', 'decent', 'thriller', 'antagonists', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'just', 'sorriest', 'group', 'villains', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'guys', 'Michael', 'Geary', 'Eklund', 'House', 'Dead', 'Adrian', 'Crab', 'Holmes', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'are', 'respectively', 'annoying', 'foolish', 'common', 'sense', 'point', 'turning', 'teammates', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'come', ""'crazy"", 'dangerous', 'type', 'Emilie', 'Dominika', 'Ullerup', 'Sanctuary', 'been', 'written', 'tough', 'chick', 'really', 'only', 'few', 'steps', 'away', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'terms', 'persona', 'Additionally', 'uncomfortable', 'thoroughly', 'un-heroic', 'scene', 'when', 'Rhodes', 'having', 'turned', 'Rambo', 'interrogates', 'kills', 'Michael', 'Eklund', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'least', 'malicious', 'group', 'bad', 'guys', 'absolutely', 'helpless', 'time', 'murder.Austin', 'Daniels', 'have', 'particularly', 'awesome', 'fight', 'performers', 'match', 'respective', 'fighting', 'styles', 'eachother', 'looking', 'inferior', 'less', 'impressive', 'other', 'later', 'Austin', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'more', 'conventional', 'brawl', 'wherein', 'latter', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'most', 'invincible', 'villains', 'ever', 'extent', 'film', 'real', 'action', 'content', 'amazingly', 'been', 'so', 'strategically', 'placed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'feel', 'deficient', 'Again', 'really', 'more', 'adventure-thriller', 'action', 'flick', 'darn', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'feather', 'hat', 'star', 'director', 'flawed', 'one', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'disappointed', 'giving', 'watch']",N/A

Great start as Steve 'Rambo' Austin and fellow Border Patrol chum Eric Roberts flush out and eliminate some low-life drug makers in a trailer.Unfortunately the great Eric Roberts departs with the druggies, a pity because he would have livened the movie up no end, this now falls to Gil Bellows to provide the dramatic bits.  Austin and daughter, now captives of the baddies, have to lead them through the woods to catch up with Mr Big who cleared off with stolen bonds in a neat double cross back in Vegas where they executed the perfect heist.It all turns out for the best in the end with the baddies squabbling amongst themselves as well as having to deal with Austin.

The ending, true to the genre, means that the death of the final baddie is strung out because you just can't keep a top baddie down; eventually he gets the point though.Overall worth a look with excellent outdoor cinematography from Tom Harting and the movie delivers, more or less, what it's supposed to.",3,Revenge is sweet,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,1330,"['second', 'viewing', 'out', 'better', 'expected', 'still', 'rather', 'predictable', 'course', 'rather', 'reminiscent', ""'Rambo"", 'First', 'blood', 'even', 'down', 'background', 'music', 'chase', 'forests', 'Montana', 'Great', 'start', 'Steve', ""'Rambo"", 'Austin', 'fellow', 'Border', 'Patrol', 'chum', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'flush', 'out', 'eliminate', 'low-life', 'drug', 'makers', 'trailer.Unfortunately', 'great', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'druggies', 'pity', 'would', 'have', 'livened', 'movie', 'end', 'now', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'provide', 'dramatic', 'bits', 'Austin', 'daughter', 'now', 'baddies', 'have', 'lead', 'woods', 'catch', 'up', 'Mr', 'Big', 'who', 'cleared', 'off', 'stolen', 'bonds', 'neat', 'double', 'cross', 'back', 'Vegas', 'where', 'executed', 'perfect', 'heist.It', 'out', 'best', 'end', 'baddies', 'squabbling', 'amongst', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'deal', 'Austin', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'action', 'only', 'one', 'set', 'piece', 'fight', 'Austin', 'kick-box', 'champ', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'ending', 'true', 'genre', 'death', 'final', 'baddie', 'strung', 'out', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'top', 'baddie', 'down', 'eventually', 'point', 'though.Overall', 'look', 'excellent', 'outdoor', 'cinematography', 'Tom', 'Harting', 'movie', 'delivers', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'supposed']",N/A

1377131,A3P222CN9HAPTF,B003Z94WBG,"Steve Benner ""Stonegnome""","[3, 4]","Steve Austin fans probably never look for much of a plot in his movies beyond the nice and simple ""big guy kicks some serious ass"" kind. This 2009 direct-to-video release, ""Hunt To Kill"",  may therefore come as something of a pleasant surprise to some viewers (although ""pleasant"" is hardly the correct word, peppered as it is with almost non-stop violence and general nastiness establishing the need for the big guy to get stuck into the serious ass-kicking). It does at least try to deliver something of a substantial plot--albeit one that is lifted wholesale from ""Cliffhanger (1992)""--and for much of the time actually succeeds. Getting the main story line established takes an eternity, though, and so as a consequence an all but irrelevant high-octane frontispiece has had to be glued on as an opener to prevent action-movie fans from falling asleep at the start. Apart from this, though, the story flows reasonably well until it needs to be interrupted for the obligatory standard fight action set-pieces, before finally disintegrating into a succession of surprises and set-backs which become so regular as to be entirely predictable.  By then, though, the action is coming thick and fast, so I doubt that fans of this genre will care one little bit.The movie's main highlight is the strong supporting cast, especially Gil Bellows in the role of an incredibly nasty cartoon villain, which he hams up to perfection and is entirely believable as a serious match to the protagonist. The production's weak points are the dialogue, which by and large is truly appalling throughout, and the musical soundtrack which is totally OTT and takes things altogether too seriously. Neither of those will deter the die-hard serious ass-kicking fan who can comfortably just sit back and watch the pretty explosions and sprays of blood.",3,Full marks for effort...,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,1827,"['Steve', 'Austin', 'probably', 'never', 'look', 'much', 'plot', 'movies', 'nice', 'simple', 'big', 'guy', 'serious', 'ass', 'kind', '2009', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'Hunt', 'Kill', 'may', 'therefore', 'come', 'something', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'viewers', 'pleasant', 'hardly', 'correct', 'word', 'peppered', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'violence', 'general', 'nastiness', 'establishing', 'need', 'big', 'guy', 'get', 'stuck', 'serious', 'ass-kicking', 'least', 'try', 'deliver', 'something', 'substantial', 'plot', 'one', 'lifted', 'wholesale', 'Cliffhanger', '1992', 'much', 'time', 'actually', 'Getting', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'established', 'eternity', 'so', 'consequence', 'irrelevant', 'high-octane', 'frontispiece', 'had', 'be', 'glued', 'opener', 'prevent', 'action-movie', 'fans', 'falling', 'asleep', 'start', 'Apart', 'though', 'story', 'reasonably', 'well', 'be', 'interrupted', 'obligatory', 'standard', 'fight', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'finally', 'disintegrating', 'succession', 'surprises', 'set-backs', 'become', 'so', 'regular', 'be', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'then', 'though', 'action', 'coming', 'thick', 'fast', 'doubt', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'care', 'one', 'little', 'bit.The', 'movie', 'main', 'highlight', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'role', 'incredibly', 'nasty', 'cartoon', 'villain', 'up', 'perfection', 'entirely', 'believable', 'serious', 'match', 'protagonist', 'production', 'weak', 'points', 'are', 'dialogue', 'large', 'truly', 'appalling', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'totally', 'OTT', 'things', 'altogether', 'too', 'seriously', 'will', 'deter', 'die-hard', 'serious', 'ass-kicking', 'fan', 'who', 'can', 'comfortably', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'pretty', 'explosions', 'sprays', 'blood']",N/A

He really stank up the movie along with a bad script. Austin plays a border patrol guard in Texas and his partner gets killed in a Meth lab raid. Some Mexican steals Austin's wallet and claims he never forgets a face. Other than the watch with a 50 foot rope wrist band, this really isn't part of the movie as the next thing we know Austin is in Montana living in the woods, chomping on grizzly burgers while his daughter hates him, but we get that information more from the DVD box than we do the script or acting.Meanwhile in Reno, a group of thieves, who are not Mexican drug dealers, steal some unmarked bonds. One of the thieves double crosses the rest and heads to Montana of all places so he can walk miles (and days) through the woods to the Canadian border (HEY! Park a little closer next time!) Now it just so happens he is carrying a tracking device so the other crooks can follow him. While this gang of crooks is in town, they force Austin and his daughter to guide them through the woods. How they knew this guy took off on foot, I don't know as he left the tracking device in an abandon vehicle on the road.The gang of crooks are not too bright and always in disagreement. At some point in time Austin is shot, falls off a mountain side and washes up on First Blood beach. He then finds a hunter's pack with a cross bow and carves out perfectly straight arrows and even attaches feathers from...? At night he puts black shoe polish under his eyes (shiny bald head is not an issue) and by day (when he really needs the polish) the shoe polish is all gone.If bad acting, corny lines, and the stupidity of the script doesn't bother you, go ahead.

1377134,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003Z94WBG,trebe,"[0, 0]","In Hunt To Kill (2010), Steve Austin plays a man who is forced to help some ruthless criminals, in order to safeguard the life of his daughter.  The high points are the action scenes, as the reality factor is low, the characters cartoonish, and the dialog woefully unimaginative.  It's nothing you haven't seen before, but if you dial your expectations down, the movie entertains on a very basic level.After a member of a criminal gang absconds with the loot, and goes into hiding in the wilderness, his partners come after him.  Led by Banks (Gil Bellows) the gang force ex-border patrol officer Jim Rhodes (Austin) to act as a guide, and also kidnap his daughter Kimberly (Marie Avgeropoulos) as a hostage.  It doesn't take long to track down the wayward thief and recover the prize.  This makes Rhodes expendable, and Banks sends him sliding down a ravine.  With Kim as his guide, Banks and his party continue on, unaware that Rhodes is still alive.Playing a hero who commits some pretty brutal and ""stone cold"" blooded kills, Steve Austin (The Condemned) is better than average here.  His range as an actor remains quite limited, but this performance should please most of his fans.  As the heavy, Gil Bellows colorfully overplays his villainous role, providing what little emotional spark there is.  Despite a story that fails to generate much real suspense, director Keoni Waxman (Maximum Conviction, True Justice) handles the action elements well, which is the primary reason to watch this movie.",3,a slightly more engaging steve austin action vehicle...,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,1503,"['Hunt', 'Kill', '2010', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'man', 'who', 'forced', 'help', 'ruthless', 'criminals', 'order', 'safeguard', 'life', 'daughter', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'action', 'scenes', 'reality', 'factor', 'low', 'characters', 'cartoonish', 'dialog', 'woefully', 'unimaginative', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'dial', 'expectations', 'down', 'movie', 'very', 'basic', 'level.After', 'member', 'criminal', 'gang', 'loot', 'hiding', 'wilderness', 'partners', 'come', 'Led', 'Banks', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'gang', 'force', 'ex-border', 'patrol', 'officer', 'Jim', 'Rhodes', 'Austin', 'act', 'guide', 'also', 'kidnap', 'daughter', 'Kimberly', 'Marie', 'Avgeropoulos', 'hostage', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'track', 'down', 'wayward', 'thief', 'recover', 'prize', 'Rhodes', 'expendable', 'Banks', 'sliding', 'down', 'ravine', 'Kim', 'guide', 'Banks', 'party', 'continue', 'unaware', 'Rhodes', 'still', 'alive.Playing', 'hero', 'who', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'stone', 'cold', 'blooded', 'kills', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Condemned', 'better', 'average', 'here', 'range', 'actor', 'quite', 'limited', 'performance', 'should', 'please', 'most', 'fans', 'heavy', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'colorfully', 'villainous', 'role', 'providing', 'what', 'little', 'emotional', 'spark', 'story', 'generate', 'much', 'real', 'suspense', 'director', 'Keoni', 'Waxman', 'Maximum', 'Conviction', 'True', 'Justice', 'action', 'elements', 'well', 'primary', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A
