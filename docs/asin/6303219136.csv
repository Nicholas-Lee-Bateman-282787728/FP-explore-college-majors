Thane Furrows, the main character, complains about loud music, cereal, telemarketers, insurance salesmen, Happy the Clam, and basically everything else, too.  After all, how can a pre-recorded message be friendly, even by calling him &quot;T. Furrows?&quot;  His response is &quot;My name is Winky, the magic dog-mule-hare catcher.&quot;  About the only time he ever leaves his apartment is when Death comes for him (Jim Carrey's tiny role) and then decides he's too annoying to take.  Still, you'll fall over laughing.",5,What a crazy movie!,1000425600,"09 14, 2001",2001,583,"['movie', 'Sienfeld', 'topics', 'are', 'useless', 'funny', 'Thane', 'Furrows', 'main', 'character', 'loud', 'music', 'cereal', 'telemarketers', 'insurance', 'salesmen', 'Happy', 'Clam', 'basically', 'everything', 'else', 'too', 'how', 'can', 'pre-recorded', 'message', 'be', 'friendly', 'even', 'calling', 'quot', 'T.', 'Furrows', 'quot', 'response', 'quot', 'name', 'Winky', 'magic', 'dog-mule-hare', 'catcher.', 'quot', 'only', 'time', 'ever', 'apartment', 'when', 'Death', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'tiny', 'role', 'then', 'too', 'annoying', 'take', 'Still', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'over', 'laughing']",High Strung VHS

You'd think that a show about a guy sitting in his room complaining for over an hour would get tedious, but it never does.  If you haven't seen this, you owe it to yourself to find a copy of this and watch it.  It's absolutely hilarious!Why in the world can't we get this on DVD?  On Steve Oedekerk's web site he had continually stated that it was in the works, but that was a few years ago.Please, Email Steve and tell him you want it on DVD!  Amazon execs, please call his people and tell him that people want it!  We NEED this on DVD.  It's not a want, it's a NEED.

I love the concept---dump the fourth wall from moment one and rant for 90 minutes at the viewer---but it hinges on genius writing, and that is sadly nowhere in evidence here. This is basically an angry stand-up comedian type idea, Lewis Black or much better Bill Hicks going off non-stop while stalking their apartment. But Oedekerk is no Hicks, or even very funny after a while. His whining gets old fast, especially as all the bits are really hacky stand-up, nothing too earth-shaking or new. And the irony of this whiner whining about whiners is just too much. Or not enough.The mean boss is kind of funny and there's some decent interplay with his pal, and the death joke is good, but I wish I'd had the sort of comedy nirvana others here seem to have enjoyed. I kept on trying to like it, but after a while I just kept thinking, ""Stand up routine in a living room, and not a great routine at that"". Even Carrey's role was too little, too late. Now if he had been the lead...Maybe I'm way off, and I just missed the genius. But as someone who loves both comedies and stand-up, I think this is a half-assed version of both.",3,My Dinner With Andre...without Andre!,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,1211,"['Boy', 'o', 'boy', 'five', 'stars', 'most', 'everyone', 'here', ""'m"", 'excited', 'rare', 'lost', 'gem', 'Oooops', 'love', 'concept', '-dump', 'fourth', 'wall', 'moment', 'one', 'rant', '90', 'minutes', 'viewer', '-but', 'genius', 'writing', 'sadly', 'nowhere', 'evidence', 'here', 'basically', 'angry', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'type', 'idea', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'much', 'better', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'going', 'off', 'non-stop', 'stalking', 'apartment', 'Oedekerk', 'Hicks', 'even', 'very', 'funny', 'while', 'whining', 'old', 'fast', 'especially', 'bits', 'are', 'really', 'hacky', 'stand-up', 'nothing', 'too', 'earth-shaking', 'new', 'irony', 'whiner', 'whining', 'whiners', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'enough.The', 'mean', 'boss', 'kind', 'funny', 'decent', 'interplay', 'pal', 'death', 'joke', 'good', 'wish', ""'d"", 'had', 'sort', 'comedy', 'nirvana', 'others', 'here', 'seem', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'kept', 'trying', 'like', 'while', 'just', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Stand', 'up', 'routine', 'living', 'room', 'not', 'great', 'routine', 'Even', 'Carrey', 'role', 'was', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'Now', 'had', 'been', 'lead', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'way', 'just', 'missed', 'genius', 'someone', 'who', 'comedies', 'stand-up', 'think', 'half-assed', 'version']",High Strung VHS
