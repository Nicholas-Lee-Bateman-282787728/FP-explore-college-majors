1333504,AM18CU72YEWH5,B00395ATT0,A. J Terry,"[16, 22]","OK, I continue to watch the series, but: It's become transparently a soap opera, constantly working hard to jerk as many tears and ""aaaaaawwwwwws"" from the audience as possible.  In every episode, there is a conflict presented between family members, or between other people, or the community of Lark Rise versus that of Candleford. And each and every episode is very predictably resolved with warm hugs and wise utterances all around.  Many of the wise utterances come straight from the modern therapist's office; ones like ""This isn't about you, it's about me."" However, some of the scriptwriters are channeling Dickens; one of them actually lifted the scene in Great Expectations where the convict threatens Pip to get him to bring food, including only a minor rewrite of Dickens' dialog.  Someone's usually in deep trouble or dying or something, and everyone (including, by inference, the viewers), hangs around and weeps for extended periods.  Even more than in previous series, the work of different scriptwriters renders the episodes discontinuous. In Series 2, Alf acquired a girlfriend, with a sentimental burying of old grudges between Lark Rise and some other hamlet never before mentioned. Now the girlfriend is gone, with no explanation--and so is the other hamlet. In one Series 3 episode, Twister somehow acquires the object of his dreams: A still. Even though it must have cost a lot of money by his standards, and furthermore, would be a source of urgently needed income or at least free booze, the still vanishes after that one episode, with no explanation. For awhile all this is made acceptable by pretty good acting, folk songs, and the golden glow on the fields (they must have used a yellow filter). But after awhile it becomes too treacly, and after that it becomes ridiculous. In other words, watch only one episode, or at the most two, per evening.One tidbit of info: The series theme music is a Polish folk dance.",3,A soap opera and tear jerker,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,1940,"['OK', 'continue', 'watch', 'series', 'become', 'transparently', 'soap', 'opera', 'constantly', 'working', 'hard', 'jerk', 'many', 'tears', 'aaaaaawwwwwws', 'audience', 'possible', 'episode', 'conflict', 'presented', 'family', 'members', 'other', 'people', 'community', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'versus', 'Candleford', 'episode', 'very', 'predictably', 'resolved', 'warm', 'hugs', 'wise', 'utterances', 'around', 'Many', 'wise', 'come', 'straight', 'modern', 'therapist', 'office', 'ones', ""n't"", 'However', 'scriptwriters', 'are', 'channeling', 'Dickens', 'one', 'actually', 'lifted', 'scene', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'where', 'convict', 'Pip', 'get', 'bring', 'food', 'including', 'only', 'minor', 'rewrite', 'Dickens', 'dialog', 'Someone', 'usually', 'deep', 'trouble', 'dying', 'something', 'everyone', 'including', 'inference', 'viewers', 'weeps', 'extended', 'periods', 'Even', 'more', 'previous', 'series', 'work', 'different', 'scriptwriters', 'episodes', 'discontinuous', 'Series', '2', 'Alf', 'acquired', 'girlfriend', 'sentimental', 'burying', 'old', 'grudges', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'other', 'hamlet', 'never', 'before', 'mentioned', 'Now', 'girlfriend', 'gone', 'explanation', 'so', 'other', 'hamlet', 'one', 'Series', '3', 'episode', 'Twister', 'somehow', 'object', 'dreams', 'still', 'Even', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'lot', 'money', 'standards', 'furthermore', 'would', 'be', 'source', 'urgently', 'needed', 'income', 'least', 'free', 'booze', 'still', 'vanishes', 'one', 'episode', 'explanation', 'made', 'acceptable', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'folk', 'songs', 'golden', 'glow', 'fields', 'must', 'have', 'used', 'yellow', 'filter', 'too', 'treacly', 'ridiculous', 'other', 'words', 'watch', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'most', 'two', 'evening.One', 'tidbit', 'info', 'series', 'theme', 'music', 'Polish', 'folk', 'dance']",Lark Rise To Candleford - Series 3 Region Free

1333520,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B00395ATT0,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 1]","I enjoy this series which carries the costume dramas, like Jane Austin works, into the realm of the average person.  After all not many of us would have been ""to the manor born,"" nor were our ancestors.  This collection is based on the novels of Flora Thompson, who wrote of her early life during the final decades of the 19th century.  Like the homely stories of Laura Ingalls Wilder who captured the same era and life in the rural America of the Midwest, those of Ms Thompson reveal the struggles of hard working farmers and small town shop keepers in England.Each episode provides a colorful vignette of country life at the time, the tale of which generally focuses on some aphorism about life drawn from the narrator's father, mother, neighbor or simply something commonly said by many in the town.  The episode is often multi-lineal, with several characters undergoing some misfortune or minor triumph and with all of these various strands pulled together into a complete whole by the end of the story.  Usually after all is said and done and no matter how far afield each little subplot seems to have wandered, when the narrator repeats the maxim at the end, one realizes just how very true it was and in how many ways it proved to be so.The delight of the entire thing is in the humanness of the characters and in the attention to detail; there are few references to the grander panorama of ""history"" as we are used to reading about it.  The most major event for these people is the coming of the railroad to a neighboring town and its likely effect on the local people and their economy.  The narrator's father is often the character that speaks for the rest of the world and the changes that are afoot beyond the borders of Lark Rise and Candleford.  While this may seem to present a very narrow portrait of the world, it is this perspective that most of us have, even today with mass communication and technology of a far higher order.  It is also this narrower view that is most real, since although history is written by ""experts"" about the high and mighty and what they did, it is experienced by individuals through the events of their lives.What surprises me most is that both Laura Ingalls and Laura Timmins live lives that are so very similar despite their separation in space, the differences in their governments, the differences in their countries' histories.  It makes it far more apparent that technology and the demands of the environment are strongly deciding factors in the type of life we live no matter where we might be.",5,Laura Ingalls Wilder of England,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,2547,"['enjoy', 'series', 'costume', 'dramas', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'realm', 'average', 'person', 'not', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'manor', 'born', 'were', 'ancestors', 'collection', 'based', 'novels', 'Flora', 'Thompson', 'who', 'wrote', 'early', 'life', 'final', 'decades', '19th', 'century', 'homely', 'stories', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'who', 'captured', 'same', 'era', 'life', 'rural', 'America', 'Midwest', 'Ms', 'Thompson', 'reveal', 'struggles', 'hard', 'working', 'farmers', 'small', 'town', 'shop', 'keepers', 'England.Each', 'episode', 'colorful', 'vignette', 'country', 'life', 'time', 'tale', 'generally', 'aphorism', 'life', 'drawn', 'narrator', 'father', 'mother', 'neighbor', 'simply', 'something', 'commonly', 'said', 'many', 'town', 'episode', 'often', 'multi-lineal', 'several', 'characters', 'undergoing', 'misfortune', 'minor', 'triumph', 'various', 'strands', 'pulled', 'together', 'complete', 'whole', 'end', 'story', 'Usually', 'said', 'done', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'little', 'subplot', 'have', 'wandered', 'when', 'narrator', 'maxim', 'end', 'one', 'realizes', 'just', 'how', 'very', 'true', 'was', 'how', 'many', 'ways', 'proved', 'be', 'so.The', 'delight', 'entire', 'thing', 'humanness', 'characters', 'attention', 'detail', 'are', 'few', 'references', 'grander', 'panorama', 'history', 'are', 'used', 'reading', 'most', 'major', 'event', 'people', 'coming', 'railroad', 'neighboring', 'town', 'likely', 'effect', 'local', 'people', 'economy', 'narrator', 'father', 'often', 'character', 'rest', 'world', 'changes', 'are', 'afoot', 'borders', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'may', 'seem', 'present', 'very', 'narrow', 'portrait', 'world', 'perspective', 'most', 'have', 'even', 'today', 'mass', 'communication', 'technology', 'far', 'higher', 'order', 'also', 'narrower', 'view', 'most', 'real', 'history', 'written', 'experts', 'high', 'mighty', 'what', 'did', 'experienced', 'individuals', 'events', 'lives.What', 'most', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Laura', 'Timmins', 'live', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'similar', 'separation', 'space', 'differences', 'governments', 'differences', 'countries', 'histories', 'far', 'more', 'apparent', 'technology', 'demands', 'environment', 'are', 'strongly', 'deciding', 'factors', 'type', 'life', 'live', 'matter', 'where', 'might', 'be']",Lark Rise To Candleford - Series 3 Region Free

All of the characters in the story are interesting and the story is authentic, written by a person who lived it.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the very human responses to life's various challenges, especially the human relationships.  There was much attention to the varieties of the  characters' values.  I found the character of Caroline Arliss especially fascinating, and wanted to know more of her earlier life.  She so enjoyed life, but lived with little restraint on her behavior.  Her love for her children was unrestrained, but also reckless.  Her irresponsibility about debt and drinking cause much distress, and eventually caught up to her in such a painful way.  How many people in our own lives can we compare to this special human problem?I also enjoyed the character of Dorcas Lane. Her steadfast and dutiful role as the village postmistress, in a time when few women held that position in their community, is lovely.  It was rewarding to see her overcome her own self-imposed limits at the end, and to accept the idea of sharing her life with a loved, and lovely man.  Her character is one that is rare in these modern times, with devotion to tradition, duty and community standing.  Even when her inclination to offer helpful advice to others became more a case of meddling than beneficial help, she remained pleasant, and open to learning a different way.The actors in this series did a good job.  After enjoying many BBC productions, it is my opinion that the British actors, writers, producers and directors view their careers more as a profession and less  as pure celebrity than  their American counterparts. Most of British actors seem to  have long, productive careers, all the while improving their craft, and enjoying many varieties of roles.  The script writing is excellent.  In all, those who produce the BBC television series do an excellent job.I feel sure that all of those good people who contribute so much to our enjoyment in the British TV productions must eventually tire of the doing the same story over many years.  However, I do wish this series had continued its story past the point in history where it ended after completion of their fourth season.  I seem not to be alone in this desire, as evidenced by responses in comments offered online.  I am grateful for all the pleasant hours this program has afforded to me.I love the atmosphere of that community.  It was indeed a treat to see people portrayed in life situations without violence or senseless crime and bloodshed.  What a shame it happens only in fictional offerings.  It was also lovely to see a community portrayed with few creature comforts that enjoyed life for its basic pleasures and blessings.I will certainly watch the four seasons of Lark Rise To Candleford again, whenever my spirits need lifting.

1333552,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00395ATT0,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 1]","Season one of Lark Rise was splendid.  Season two was very good, but I felt it was not quite up to season one.  Now that I have finished season three, I must say that this is my favorite and what I consider the best season so far.In this stately period drama (using the word drama loosely because this is as far from melodrama as the word drama can be), we continue to glimpse into the lives of the families of these two towns in the late 19th century Britain.  This series continues to impress me with the authentic story telling of these families.  On the one side, you have Lark Rise, a simple farming hamlet.  On the other side is Candleford, an up and coming town with a population tuned in to the affairs of the world at large.In season three we see the Golden Lion Hotel flourishing.  One recurring guest star opens up a newspaper in Candleford.  But despite these changes, life mainly proceeds as it has.  People still have their interactions, their misunderstandings, quarrels, and tiffs.  But they also have camaraderie and spirit.  This is so well portrayed when measles strikes Lark Rise and the folks of Candleford come to help their neighbors.The actors are magnificent in their portrayals of these characters.  The people haven't changed too much.  Their personalities are very well thought out.  I also enjoy that in this show a scandal involves something such as a woman wearing pants instead of a skirt.  This isn't the type of television one usually sees (people having relations all over the place, illegitimate kids, murders, etc...)  Instead, it is a tragic and shocking event when a person is sent to the debtors prison.  Even the story of a homeless wanderer catches the interest of the local paper and even the London papers.The series is slow, stately, and well written and well acted.  I have enjoyed all three seasons so far and plan on enjoying season four (which is the final season so far - though there is a major uproar in Britain for a new series (season) five).  I highly recommend this series to fans of Downton Abbey or Cranford.",5,Season three continues the excellent storytelling ~,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,2066,"['Season', 'one', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'was', 'splendid', 'Season', 'two', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'season', 'one', 'Now', 'have', 'finished', 'season', 'three', 'must', 'say', 'favorite', 'what', 'consider', 'best', 'season', 'so', 'far.In', 'stately', 'period', 'drama', 'using', 'word', 'drama', 'loosely', 'as', 'far', 'melodrama', 'word', 'drama', 'can', 'be', 'continue', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'families', 'two', 'towns', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'Britain', 'series', 'impress', 'authentic', 'story', 'telling', 'families', 'one', 'side', 'have', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'simple', 'farming', 'hamlet', 'other', 'side', 'Candleford', 'up', 'coming', 'town', 'population', 'tuned', 'affairs', 'world', 'large.In', 'season', 'three', 'see', 'Golden', 'Lion', 'Hotel', 'flourishing', 'One', 'recurring', 'guest', 'star', 'up', 'newspaper', 'Candleford', 'changes', 'life', 'mainly', 'People', 'still', 'have', 'interactions', 'misunderstandings', 'quarrels', 'tiffs', 'also', 'have', 'camaraderie', 'spirit', 'so', 'well', 'portrayed', 'when', 'measles', 'strikes', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'folks', 'Candleford', 'come', 'help', 'neighbors.The', 'actors', 'are', 'magnificent', 'portrayals', 'characters', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'too', 'much', 'personalities', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'also', 'enjoy', 'show', 'scandal', 'something', 'such', 'woman', 'wearing', 'pants', 'instead', 'skirt', ""n't"", 'type', 'television', 'one', 'usually', 'people', 'having', 'relations', 'place', 'illegitimate', 'kids', 'murders', 'etc', 'Instead', 'tragic', 'shocking', 'event', 'when', 'person', 'sent', 'debtors', 'prison', 'Even', 'story', 'homeless', 'wanderer', 'interest', 'local', 'paper', 'even', 'London', 'papers.The', 'series', 'slow', 'stately', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'plan', 'enjoying', 'season', 'four', 'final', 'season', 'so', 'far', 'major', 'uproar', 'Britain', 'new', 'series', 'season', 'five', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'fans', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Cranford']",Lark Rise To Candleford - Series 3 Region Free

I would have given this 3 stars were it not for the last few episodes where Fisher returns.  He helped this season to end MUCH better than it otherwise would have although not as well as it could have if Laura had actually chosen him... but perhaps that's just my opinion.

After viewing seasons 1-3 of ""Lark Rise to Candleford"", I have come to the realization that I continue to view this British series mainly because it gives me some needed escape from my usual viewing (murder mysteries, detective shows, hard-hitting dramas, etc.).  Again, in Season three (3), of this well-directed and beautifully photographed BBC series, we are witness to some very, almost unbelievably, nice people.  These unbelievably nice, hard working, conscience and very wholesome people live and work in the gorgeous villages of Lark Rise and Candleford in England in early ""Victorian times"".  After viewing Season three (3) of this series,  I came to the conclusion that although, as in previous seasons, the stories in Season three (3) are set in the early 1800s, I really don't believe that life was as simple, easy and wholesome as this series makes it out to have been no matter how  beautiful the  locales.  We see no violence, sex, crime, dastardly happenings nor do we hear any ""bad"" language.In Season three (3) there are only, to me, very mild annoyances to be dealt with.  All of these annoying problems happen mainly in and around the post office in Candleford where the head mistress is very sweetly (almost cloyingly sweet, at times) acted by Julia Sawalha, as Dorcas--Julia Sawalha also acted in ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""AB FAB""--the character is also the mentor of the narrator of the story, Julia Timmins, who is from an extremely wholesome family comprised of a ""know-it-all"", very hard working boarding on the ""self righteous"" father and a ""long-suffering"" tearful, multi-child-bearing, humble, ""very motherly"" mother along with devoted and loving siblings all living devoid of much money in Lark Rise--her memories form the basis of these stories.The problems that arise are solved by the extremely good citizens of the above mentioned villages with grace, good-will, tolerance and understanding, extreme love, determination, resolve, super niceness, kindness, concern, extreme caring, the singing of little tunes, a sip of beer and, of course, prayer plus the problems and annoyances are resolved without violence, bloodletting, mayhem, killings, revenge-murders for hire, chasing of the culprits, beatings, slapping or punching of same nor is there any cursing.  In other words, it is very safe to gather the entire family  to watch ""Lark Rise to Candleford"".As I said before, I am sure that I continue to view this series mainly because it lets me have a few hours of escape from programs that are kind of based on what's real plus it's very well done and if you can ""buy"" or tolerate all of the goodness of the characters that are shown, it's well acted too.",4,An escape from reality,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,2807,"['desire', 'need', 'time', 'time', 'little', 'break', 'stark', 'reality', 'series', 'viewing', 'seasons', '1-3', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'have', 'come', 'realization', 'continue', 'view', 'British', 'series', 'mainly', 'needed', 'escape', 'usual', 'viewing', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'detective', 'shows', 'hard-hitting', 'dramas', 'etc.', 'Again', 'Season', 'three', '3', 'well-directed', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'BBC', 'series', 'are', 'witness', 'very', 'almost', 'unbelievably', 'nice', 'people', 'unbelievably', 'nice', 'hard', 'working', 'conscience', 'very', 'wholesome', 'people', 'live', 'work', 'gorgeous', 'villages', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'England', 'early', 'Victorian', 'times', 'viewing', 'Season', 'three', '3', 'series', 'came', 'conclusion', 'previous', 'seasons', 'stories', 'Season', 'three', '3', 'are', 'set', 'early', '1800s', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'life', 'was', 'simple', 'easy', 'wholesome', 'series', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'matter', 'how', 'beautiful', 'locales', 'see', 'violence', 'sex', 'crime', 'dastardly', 'happenings', 'do', 'hear', 'bad', 'language.In', 'Season', 'three', '3', 'are', 'only', 'very', 'mild', 'annoyances', 'be', 'dealt', 'annoying', 'problems', 'happen', 'mainly', 'post', 'office', 'Candleford', 'where', 'head', 'mistress', 'very', 'sweetly', 'almost', 'cloyingly', 'sweet', 'times', 'acted', 'Julia', 'Sawalha', 'Dorcas', 'Julia', 'Sawalha', 'also', 'acted', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'AB', 'FAB', 'character', 'also', 'mentor', 'narrator', 'story', 'Julia', 'Timmins', 'who', 'extremely', 'wholesome', 'family', 'comprised', 'know-it-all', 'very', 'hard', 'working', 'boarding', 'self', 'righteous', 'father', 'long-suffering', 'tearful', 'multi-child-bearing', 'humble', 'very', 'motherly', 'mother', 'devoted', 'loving', 'siblings', 'living', 'devoid', 'much', 'money', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'memories', 'form', 'basis', 'stories.The', 'problems', 'arise', 'are', 'solved', 'extremely', 'good', 'citizens', 'above', 'mentioned', 'villages', 'grace', 'good-will', 'tolerance', 'understanding', 'extreme', 'love', 'determination', 'resolve', 'super', 'niceness', 'kindness', 'concern', 'extreme', 'caring', 'singing', 'little', 'tunes', 'sip', 'beer', 'course', 'prayer', 'problems', 'annoyances', 'are', 'resolved', 'violence', 'bloodletting', 'mayhem', 'killings', 'revenge-murders', 'hire', 'chasing', 'culprits', 'beatings', 'slapping', 'punching', 'same', 'there', 'cursing', 'other', 'words', 'very', 'safe', 'gather', 'entire', 'family', 'watch', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', '.As', 'said', 'am', 'sure', 'continue', 'view', 'series', 'mainly', 'have', 'few', 'hours', 'escape', 'programs', 'are', 'kind', 'based', 'what', 'real', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'buy', 'tolerate', 'goodness', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'well', 'acted', 'too']",Lark Rise To Candleford - Series 3 Region Free

English country life at a poetic, pictorial, and enchanting peak. Lives of those living in Lark Rise and Candleford mingle as delicately and wonderfully as frosting on a bridal cake. Even the DVD's music puts a sanguine sugarcoating on the period.4 DVDs, 12 episodes, about 12 hours, all 1800s awesome. Subtitled. It is romance, nostalgia, saga, suspense, drama, well...it's a cornucopia of viewing that is not to be missed. Especially for the folks who have already sat through seasons 1 & 2, it continues with a great and large nucleus cast, but the stories and depth of characters are growing with the show's movement.Julia Sawalha (`Return to Cranford') as Dorcas continues as a major player, the postmistress of Candleford, but how long can she keep the postal position? Claudie Blakley (also of `Return to Cranford') as Emma, work well together, both with female roles that show a modern worthiness of women, but without hurting the period setting of the series. Her devoted husband, Robert (Brendan Coyle) delightful marriage interaction between the two, gives way from some of the Timmins family emphasis, to the advancement of Emma. Even though the show offers these 21 century tendencies, it harms nothing of the charm and warmth of a perfection of Victorian set, costume, and attitude that this show, now in year 3 has become known for. Jane Austin would have loved this show. And Catherine Cookson too, although most of Lark Rise and Candleford are less brutal than the commoners and towns of Cookson's adapted works.Journalist, Daniel Parish (Ben Aldridge) arrives in town which leads to several situations for locals. Viewers will confront measles, witchcraft, bribes, pregnancy, beggars to inheritants, romance, rivalries, and multiple job-insecurity issues. Life. Life as we see now, and life in the 1880s. Amazing writing. Riveting dialogue.Also, be warned. Expect belly laughs too. Those Pratt sisters, Twister (OK tears too) and wife, Queenie, not to mention, Thomas the Bible-quoting, bike-riding, mail-deliverer, and his wife, Margaret (all returning regulars) could put together a comedy show every bit as good as this dramatic series has been--from day one. There is an abundance of fine British dramatic programming available, but this has to be one of my favorite.It's very comparable to ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" in that it is a continuing family struggle 1800s adventure, and hopefully the lady postmistress will survive as long as the lady doctor did. The end of episode 12 does lend itself to continuation, thankfully. I do SO RECOMMEND ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" series 1 and 2 as well.

Watching these episodes and re-reading my journals gave me an opportunity to remember - with laughter some ofmy traumatic martial first, such as when Emma pointed out Robert had stinky feet and the camera fell on his feet showing the holes in his each sock with the toe exposed.  I laughted with Emma and Robt but as a new wife I did not find it amusing to have a husband in that situation. My Dad never wore socks with holes in them. He soaked his feet each night before he took a bath.  After all, suppose my husband had been involved in an accident and had to be taken to a hospital!  What would people think of me for not removing those socks from his drawer?  I am ashamed of the importance I gave the situation in real life (I later accepted, my husband enjoys wearing holes in his socks.  He says it allows his feet to have air.)Reflecting, I see others have experienced the same situation or at least the writers of this episode, and I am delighted with the common sense approach the on screen characters used to diffuse anger.  The show is not only entertaining but is thought provoking. Also, who is to say in hamlets and villages at the time depicted in this piece, women and men did not entertain 20th century procedures in the business world (arbitrators for labor/Management)or adoptions by a single woman did not occur probably under another name.

The characters are such nice people (except for the snotty dressmaker).  The scenery is lovely.  The stories are a bit slowwww[...]Having said that, this season did feel a bit more soap-opera-ish that the first two.  It felt like the writers were desperately contriving conflict to add drama.  Now, I know drama generally has conflict involved, but honestly...the writers were wringing it out in this season.  Every episode had not one, but several ""Oh NO!"" moments...seriously, at one point I started laughing because it was all too much.Two thoughts: How come Robert Timmins is the only man in the village with any sense?  He always has to be the voice of reason for the Lark Rise mob.  It's kind of funny.  Also: Why is the serving girl SO incredibly stupid?

The casting is excellent, with a talented ensemble cast who add real depth to the characters portrayed, the stories are generally interesting with real human drama with all the pains and joys experienced by the inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford, and the cinematography is simply breathtaking.Season Three sees the introduction of a significant new character, Daniel Parrish (played by Ben Aldridge), a young journalist who arrives in Lark Rise with some life-altering news for the Timmins. Emma (Claudie Blakley) might inherit a fortune, and both Emma and her husband Robert (Brendan Coyle) ponder the possibilities and opportunities this signifies for them as a family. Parrish is also drawn to Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) who has matured into a true beauty, but still harbors heartache from the break-up with clockmaker Fisher Price in Season 2.The independent and strong-willed Dorcas Lane (played by the talented and lovely Julia Sawalha) continues as Candleford's postmistress, and experiences some human drama of her own, taking on a role that she finds fulfills her immensely. Unlike previous seasons, Dorcas' story is no longer the only dominant thread this season, as other characters begin to get more screen time (yes, I was not too pleased with this, but I felt some of these stories were still well done). One story arc which I particularly enjoyed watching was the marital adventures of postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) and his devoted wife Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade). Their antics just make me laugh out loud, and yet there is also a poignancy to their marriage which is explored later in the season. This balance makes them an interesting couple to watch on-screen and the actors outdo themselves in lending credibility and depth to their characters.Minnie, the bumbling yet lovable maid from Season 2 is given a meatier role this season, and I loved how Dorcas takes Minnie under her wing, grooming her not for a life of servitude but for something far more worthy and fulfilling, with mixed results - a blend of hilarity and poignancy that had me laughing one moment and tearing up the next.Strong and resilient Emma Timmins also gets a chance to explore other sides to her role - she is not just a loving mother and loyal wife this season, but yearns to be something more which I felt rounded-out her character very nicely this season. One of the story arcs I've loved throughout seasons 1-3 is the strong bond of love between Robert and Emma Timmins, one which is further explored this season.The Pratt sisters, Ruby and Pearl (Victoria Hamilton and Matilda Zeigler) continue their roles as town busybodies and this season sees a major upheaval which threatens the sisters formerly close knit bond with each other. Young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh, also one of my favorite characters after Dorcas and Robert) begins to mature into his role as the head of his family, assuming real responsibilities, but also faces some serious and heartbreaking challenges.This season also sees the inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford coming together in times of crisis, helping each other out, and setting aside their differences which I felt was timely and touching. The stories make you feel like you're there, experiencing these people's joys and pains, their triumphs and failures, and the slowly developing sense of community between both hamlets.There are many other story threads this season that will engage viewers and keep them riveted to the screen. Is Season Three as good as Seasons 1 & 2? Well, on some counts yes, and others no, but the talented ensemble cast puts together another charming and poignant season to please viewers in general. I only hope Season 4 is a reality and that BBC continues making this wonderful period drama!",5,An enchanting British period drama,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,3935,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'faithful', 'fan', 'LRtC', 'Season', 'One', 'just', 'love', 'period', 'drama', 'centered', 'inhabitants', 'hamlet', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'town', 'Candleford', 'casting', 'excellent', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'who', 'add', 'real', 'depth', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'stories', 'are', 'generally', 'interesting', 'real', 'human', 'drama', 'pains', 'joys', 'experienced', 'inhabitants', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'breathtaking.Season', 'Three', 'introduction', 'significant', 'new', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Parrish', 'played', 'Ben', 'Aldridge', 'young', 'journalist', 'who', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'life-altering', 'news', 'Timmins', 'Emma', 'Claudie', 'Blakley', 'might', 'inherit', 'fortune', 'Emma', 'husband', 'Robert', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'ponder', 'possibilities', 'opportunities', 'signifies', 'family', 'Parrish', 'also', 'drawn', 'Laura', 'Timmins', 'Olivia', 'Hallinan', 'who', 'matured', 'true', 'beauty', 'still', 'harbors', 'heartache', 'break-up', 'clockmaker', 'Fisher', 'Price', 'Season', '2.The', 'independent', 'strong-willed', 'Dorcas', 'Lane', 'played', 'talented', 'lovely', 'Julia', 'Sawalha', 'Candleford', 'postmistress', 'human', 'drama', 'own', 'taking', 'role', 'fulfills', 'immensely', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Dorcas', 'story', 'longer', 'only', 'dominant', 'thread', 'season', 'other', 'characters', 'begin', 'get', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'yes', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'pleased', 'felt', 'stories', 'were', 'still', 'well', 'done', 'One', 'story', 'arc', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'was', 'marital', 'adventures', 'postman', 'Thomas', 'Brown', 'Mark', 'Heap', 'devoted', 'wife', 'Margaret', 'Ellison', 'Sandy', 'McDade', 'antics', 'just', 'make', 'loud', 'yet', 'also', 'poignancy', 'marriage', 'explored', 'later', 'season', 'balance', 'interesting', 'couple', 'watch', 'on-screen', 'actors', 'outdo', 'lending', 'credibility', 'depth', 'characters.Minnie', 'bumbling', 'yet', 'lovable', 'maid', 'Season', '2', 'given', 'meatier', 'role', 'season', 'loved', 'how', 'Dorcas', 'Minnie', 'wing', 'grooming', 'not', 'life', 'servitude', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'worthy', 'fulfilling', 'mixed', 'results', 'blend', 'hilarity', 'poignancy', 'had', 'laughing', 'one', 'moment', 'tearing', 'up', 'next.Strong', 'resilient', 'Emma', 'Timmins', 'also', 'chance', 'explore', 'other', 'sides', 'role', 'not', 'just', 'loving', 'mother', 'loyal', 'wife', 'season', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'felt', 'rounded-out', 'character', 'very', 'nicely', 'season', 'One', 'story', 'arcs', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'seasons', '1-3', 'strong', 'bond', 'love', 'Robert', 'Emma', 'Timmins', 'one', 'further', 'explored', 'season.The', 'Pratt', 'sisters', 'Ruby', 'Pearl', 'Victoria', 'Hamilton', 'Matilda', 'Zeigler', 'continue', 'roles', 'town', 'busybodies', 'season', 'major', 'upheaval', 'sisters', 'formerly', 'close', 'knit', 'bond', 'other', 'Young', 'Alf', 'Arless', 'John', 'Dagliesh', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Dorcas', 'Robert', 'mature', 'role', 'head', 'family', 'assuming', 'real', 'responsibilities', 'also', 'serious', 'heartbreaking', 'challenges.This', 'season', 'also', 'inhabitants', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'coming', 'together', 'times', 'crisis', 'helping', 'other', 'setting', 'aside', 'differences', 'felt', 'was', 'timely', 'touching', 'stories', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'there', 'experiencing', 'people', 'joys', 'pains', 'triumphs', 'failures', 'slowly', 'developing', 'sense', 'community', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'story', 'threads', 'season', 'will', 'engage', 'viewers', 'keep', 'riveted', 'screen', 'Season', 'Three', 'as', 'good', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Well', 'counts', 'yes', 'others', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'together', 'charming', 'poignant', 'season', 'please', 'viewers', 'general', 'only', 'hope', 'Season', '4', 'reality', 'BBC', 'making', 'wonderful', 'period', 'drama']",Lark Rise To Candleford - Series 3 Region Free
