973407,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000EHSVFU,,"[3, 4]","Cinema-wise, you know you're witnessing the beginning of the end when the best Hollywood can come up with is a SEQUEL to a REMAKE (it`s not often that two crimes of unoriginality are committed in a single film).  But that is exactly what ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"" turns out to be - and the result, quality-wise, is pretty much what one would expect.This is one of those alleged family comedies in which the adults (the male adults at any rate) are infinitely more immature in their attitude and behavior than the children they are raising.  Steve Martin returns as the prolific father of twelve who is beginning to sense that his children, as they are growing older, no longer want to spend quality time together as a family.  To rectify the situation, he takes them all on a vacation to a favorite lake resort - a move that threatens to turn into a full-scale disaster when the Bakers find themselves embroiled in a fierce competition with a neighboring family of snooty overachievers led by Eugene Levy, a patriarch who runs his brood with so much spit-and-polish regimentation that he makes Captain Von Trapp look like a touchy-feely pushover in comparison.One might be tempted to call this a distended version of a ""Brady Bunch"" episode and leave it at that, but even that show, for all its lack of sophistication, didn't portray the father as a total and irredeemable doofus with serious developmental issues and the emotional maturity of a bratty six-year-old.  Besides the daddy-is-a-dope stereotype, all ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"" has to offer is lame slapstick, a silly pre-pubescent ""Romeo and Juliet"" subplot, and push-button scenes of emotional uplift in which a crescendo of swelling violins serves as the cue for the tears to start flowing.  The drearily unoriginal screenplay comes replete with the requisite dog-humping incidents and poop jokes, and not one but TWO scenes of an elderly handicapped gentleman rolling off into the lake in a wheelchair.Any more of these films and Planned Parenthood won't have to mount a fundraising drive for years to come.",2,"""Family Values"" dreck",1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,2069,"['Cinema-wise', 'know', ""'re"", 'witnessing', 'beginning', 'end', 'when', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'SEQUEL', 'REMAKE', 's', 'not', 'often', 'two', 'crimes', 'unoriginality', 'are', 'committed', 'single', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', '2', 'out', 'be', 'result', 'quality-wise', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect.This', 'one', 'alleged', 'family', 'comedies', 'adults', 'male', 'adults', 'rate', 'are', 'infinitely', 'more', 'immature', 'attitude', 'behavior', 'children', 'are', 'raising', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'prolific', 'father', 'twelve', 'who', 'beginning', 'sense', 'children', 'are', 'growing', 'older', 'longer', 'want', 'spend', 'quality', 'time', 'together', 'family', 'rectify', 'situation', 'vacation', 'favorite', 'lake', 'resort', 'move', 'turn', 'full-scale', 'disaster', 'when', 'Bakers', 'find', 'embroiled', 'fierce', 'competition', 'neighboring', 'family', 'snooty', 'overachievers', 'led', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'patriarch', 'who', 'brood', 'so', 'much', 'spit-and-polish', 'regimentation', 'Captain', 'Von', 'Trapp', 'look', 'touchy-feely', 'pushover', 'comparison.One', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'call', 'distended', 'version', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'episode', 'leave', 'even', 'show', 'lack', 'sophistication', 'did', ""n't"", 'portray', 'father', 'total', 'irredeemable', 'doofus', 'serious', 'developmental', 'issues', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'bratty', 'six-year-old', 'daddy-is-a-dope', 'stereotype', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', '2', 'offer', 'lame', 'slapstick', 'silly', 'pre-pubescent', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'subplot', 'push-button', 'scenes', 'emotional', 'uplift', 'crescendo', 'swelling', 'violins', 'serves', 'cue', 'tears', 'start', 'flowing', 'drearily', 'unoriginal', 'screenplay', 'replete', 'requisite', 'dog-humping', 'incidents', 'poop', 'jokes', 'not', 'one', 'TWO', 'scenes', 'elderly', 'handicapped', 'gentleman', 'rolling', 'off', 'lake', 'wheelchair.Any', 'more', 'films', 'Planned', 'Parenthood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'mount', 'fundraising', 'drive', 'years', 'come']",N/A

973411,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000EHSVFU,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","My wife and I actually enjoyed the first `Cheaper' outing, so we were kind of excited about this one.  I mean, Eugene Levy is hysterical (we love him) and the idea of him sparing with comedic legend Steve Martin was just too much not to anticipate.This film is a horrible mess.I don't know why I felt the need to build up to that, I mean, this film really deserves to apologies or excuses or really anything other than a complete panning, but for some reason I feel compelled to give it two stars (that's still a D).  As horrible as this movie is, and as generic and tasteless and clich&eacute;d and predictable and nauseatingly syrupy preachy (call Ron Howard, Shankman is encroaching on his heavy handed territory) it is, `Cheaper by the Dozen 2' has a thin (very thin) layer of heartwarming enjoyment.  So, while I didn't like it, I didn't hate it.Thank you Levy for remaining funny when Martin wasn't, and thank you little Alyson Stoner for giving this ridiculously unbelievable film a layer of genuine youthful honesty.This film follows the Baker clan as they embark on a vacation back to their old stomping grounds in order to reestablish family unity.  The oldest Baker girls are moving away and Tom feels as though he's losing his grip on his family.  With everyone on board they all make the trip, only to find that they are drifting further apart as Tom's competitive spirit flies into overdrive when he's reunited with childhood nemesis Jimmy Murtaugh.The storyline is pretty simple, but its all the `finding yourself' gushiness that really drags this film into `roll your eyes' ridiculousness.  When the eldest Baker boy and the eldest Murtaugh daughter get together all sorts of stupid and unrealistic `findings' take place.  Whoever wrote this (you Sam Harper) was really lazy, stuffing a bunch of supposed heartwarming sequences into one poorly constructed package.  I love you Shankman (mostly because you amuse me on `So You Think You Can Dance') but this is a horrifying cinematic mess if I ever saw one.Steve Martin is awkward, Bonnie Hunt is barely there, Piper Perabo is sadly underused (again!), Tom Welling is boring, Carmen Electra is hot, Eugene Levy is funny (even if you want to punch him throughout the whole movie), Jaime King is pretty yet dense, Hilary Duff is hideous and talentless (way too thin physically and emotionally)...but there is always Alyson Stoner, who carries this movie on her inexperienced shoulders.Walk away.  I advise everyone to walk away.  There is far better out there.  And to all those giving this five stars because it's `clean family fun' I say ""I'm happy for you"" but really, there are much better `clean' films out there, so why waste precious time with this one?",2,The second outing feels much `cheaper'...,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,2723,"['wife', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Cheaper', 'outing', 'were', 'kind', 'excited', 'one', 'mean', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'hysterical', 'love', 'idea', 'sparing', 'comedic', 'legend', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'anticipate.This', 'film', 'horrible', 'mess.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'felt', 'need', 'build', 'up', 'mean', 'film', 'really', 'apologies', 'excuses', 'really', 'anything', 'other', 'complete', 'panning', 'reason', 'feel', 'compelled', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'still', 'D', 'As', 'horrible', 'movie', 'generic', 'tasteless', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'predictable', 'nauseatingly', 'syrupy', 'preachy', 'call', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Shankman', 'encroaching', 'heavy', 'handed', 'territory', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', '2', 'thin', 'very', 'thin', 'layer', 'heartwarming', 'enjoyment', 'So', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'it.Thank', 'Levy', 'remaining', 'funny', 'when', 'Martin', 'was', ""n't"", 'thank', 'little', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'giving', 'ridiculously', 'unbelievable', 'film', 'layer', 'genuine', 'youthful', 'honesty.This', 'film', 'Baker', 'clan', 'embark', 'vacation', 'back', 'old', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'order', 'reestablish', 'family', 'unity', 'oldest', 'Baker', 'girls', 'are', 'moving', 'away', 'Tom', 'feels', 'losing', 'grip', 'family', 'everyone', 'board', 'make', 'trip', 'only', 'find', 'are', 'drifting', 'further', 'apart', 'Tom', 'competitive', 'spirit', 'flies', 'overdrive', 'when', 'reunited', 'childhood', 'nemesis', 'Jimmy', 'Murtaugh.The', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'simple', 'finding', 'gushiness', 'really', 'film', 'roll', 'eyes', 'ridiculousness', 'When', 'eldest', 'Baker', 'boy', 'eldest', 'Murtaugh', 'daughter', 'get', 'together', 'sorts', 'stupid', 'unrealistic', 'findings', 'take', 'place', 'Whoever', 'wrote', 'Sam', 'Harper', 'was', 'really', 'lazy', 'stuffing', 'bunch', 'supposed', 'heartwarming', 'sequences', 'one', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'package', 'love', 'Shankman', 'mostly', 'amuse', 'So', 'Think', 'Can', 'Dance', 'horrifying', 'cinematic', 'mess', 'ever', 'saw', 'one.Steve', 'Martin', 'awkward', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'barely', 'there', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'sadly', 'underused', 'again', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'boring', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'hot', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'funny', 'even', 'want', 'punch', 'whole', 'movie', 'Jaime', 'King', 'pretty', 'yet', 'dense', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'hideous', 'talentless', 'way', 'too', 'thin', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'always', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'who', 'movie', 'inexperienced', 'shoulders.Walk', 'away', 'advise', 'everyone', 'walk', 'away', 'far', 'better', 'there', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'clean', 'family', 'fun', 'say', ""'m"", 'happy', 'really', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'clean', 'films', 'there', 'so', 'why', 'waste', 'precious', 'time', 'one']",N/A

In the first one, they were having troubles with moving, feeling part of the family, parent's jobs and so on and so forth, whereas in #2, there are a lot more issues with the family all together, such as, the kids are getting older, Nora is pregnant, they want to be treated more like adults, and really more about the family staying a family and not just scattering everywhere and forgetting everything they've been through. There were a lot more great actors, plus another large family rivalry which wasn't really a family rivalry, but a father to father rivalry, which was hysterical because the kids don't really want to be rivals!I suggest this movie to any families, small or large, I can almost certainly assure you you'll like it.

973415,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B000EHSVFU,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 3]","Steve Martin has a way of bringing the issues of parenting to the screen in a truly delightful way.  I enjoyed his remake of Father of the Bride, and its successor, found the remake of Cheaper by the Dozen much more enjoyable than I'd expected, and this sequel even more delightful than the first one.I was fond of the Clifton Webb Cheaper by the Dozen film as a rerun  on TV as a kid, but I have to admit, having seen it again recently, it is a bit time worn and predictable.  I was impressed that Martin did not attempt to do an exact remake of the older film.  It would have been such a major disappointment, because nothing can capture the ambiance of the old film and its stars.  Like his film of the Roustand play Cyrano, Martin has created his own version of Cheaper by the Dozen.  The story is given a thoroughly modern twist and a ""warm fuzzies"" feeling that makes it a unique joy.  While it's hardly War and Peace-a Steve Martin version of that would be really intriging-and it's story line was more than a little  predictable, the characters were likeable people, ones that a person might actually enjoy knowing.  I especially enjoyed the fact that in the end neither method of parenting, the controlling, driven parent or the lasez faire parent, was seen as definitive, and both were shown to have their limitations.  In the end, all the kids were decent human beings.

These three leads are what make this otherwise ""vanilla"" flick worthwhile. I enjoyed the original, but I knew what I would get when going to see this sequel. I was right. Looking over other reviews, it appears that the ones who really tell it like it is about the movie get bombarded with the negative votes, and the ones who praise it as if it were celluloid gold(which it's the exact opposite)get all the votes. As an innocent film for the younger set and families, it is quite good. It is good for the families and is nice and clean and all that, but it has no character. It's undistinguished and nothing sets it apart. It's just more of the same. If you want something very, very safe and by the numbers, then this is for you.  Our three adults try their best with the film. Even though they are what keep this film watchable, and deliver the film's most humorous moments, they don't always succeed either. But you can tell that they are trying to raise the bar a little and bring more to the material, because there isn't much there. There is no bigger Steve Martin fan than myself, but this isn't his worthiest effort. He seems to be phoning it in. The Baker family returns with all twelve kids intact. Oldest daughter(Piper Perabo) is even expecting her own. Tom(Martin)feels that the family is drifting away from each other, and decides to have one last family blow out at the lake they used to visit. They all head there and Tom soon finds himself against his old rival Murtaugh(Eugene Levy), who is filthy rich and owns most of the lake. Murtaugh has eight kids and a trophy wife(Carmen Electra). Soon, The Baker family and the Murtaugh family find themselves challenging each other in different ways. The older kids, except Perabo, are wasted. Hilary Duff(who is not looking as cute as she used too)is only there for a quick scene here and there and to offer beauty tips. She must owe the producer or someone a favor. Tom Welling, who is 28 and playing much younger, has nothing to do either except to pretty up the scenery and hook up with a Murtaugh daughter. All the other kids might as well be kid #1 and kid #2, because there are too many of them. Not much time is spent on most of them and they just become faces in the crowd. The script is prettty predictable and cliched, and the film can be quite corny. Especially the number of scenes that have sweeping music coming into the background. The movie has some nice moments and a scene here and there that might make you smile, but the movie is pretty laugh free. So, is there anything to recommend?. Well, the scenery is nice, and the adults deliver. Hunt is always adorable, and it's her own dry kind of wit that is especially welcomed here. Levy is always welcomed, and Steve Martin can make anything look better than it is. And Carmen Electra?. Well, this is the best movie she's ever been in. That's not saying much. It is nowhere near as good as the first one, not that that one was a classic. But if you are looking for something to take the kids and grandma too, you couldn't do much worse.

973417,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000EHSVFU,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is an improvement over the first one.  Not a BIG improvement.  Just a slightly better film.I didn't care for how typical of a family movie this turned out to be.  It also seemed like, while watching the family at that vacation place, that the only reason this movie exists is to make a few extra bucks and ride the momentum of the success of the previous movie.  The writing was weak overall.The movie is about Steve Martin (of course) who's the father of 12 children feuding with another father (of 8 kids) at this vacation place.  Now, the story parts where the two fathers continued to get in their little digs because they didn't get along with each other was funny, but they really wasted some potential here for good action scenes.An example: in one scene, Steve Martin tells his younger daughter about a plan to do something bad to the guy, but what happens?  Only one above-average moment takes place involving a dog going crazy and jumping around on top of a dinner table, ruining the bad fathers ""good china"".  It just wasn't particularly memorable writing.  We were led to believe the rest of the movie would involve Steve's daughter finding ways to torment the guy, but after this scene, nothing more really happened, and the focus shifted on the daughter dating a boy around her age.  Why?Maybe they were trying to step the writing up a notch by maturing the kids.  If that's the case, it's too soon for that.  After all, this is only the second Cheaper by the Dozen movie.  Wait until a third one, if one actually happens.However, at least this time around, we actually care about the kids.  Last time it felt like the kids were only there for Steve Martin to have fun with.  Unfortunately the daughter of the other father looked exactly like the guys wife, and so throughout the movie I was constantly asking myself ""who is who?""

Oldest daughter Nora (Piper Perabo), VERY pregnant (but not by her 2003 'flame', Ashton Kutcher, who passed on the sequel), plans to move with her husband to a new city; oldest son Charlie (Tom Welling, taking a break from ""Smallville""), is contemplating a future away from home, as well. Daughter Lorraine (Hilary Duff, as irritating and one-dimensional as she'd been in the original), is graduating from high school, and wants to leave the family to attend college cross-country. BIG changes are afoot, and Tom ISN'T happy!While all this could make for a serious, warm family comedy (in the vein of ""Parenthood""), 20th Century Fox, preferring the 'quick bucks' a 'kid-friendly' slapstick-themed farce would generate, quickly moves the film into a ""Meatballs"" mode, with Martin and (the underused) Bonnie Hunt taking the kids on a last 'family vacation', to a lake retreat they'd used, disastrously, years earlier. Back then, Tom had ended upcompeting with smarmy Jimmy Murtaugh and his brood...and sure enough, they AGAIN run into the now-rich Murtaugh (Eugene Levy, doing his usual 'schtick'), his 'trophy' wife, Sarina (the surprisingly good Carmen Electra), and his 'over-trained' children...again leading to the expected competition, and LOTS of pratfall opportunities for Martin.A budding romance between Welling's Charlie, and Anne Murtaugh (Jaime King, returning to 'G'-rated fare after sex-and-violence-drenched ""Sin City"") is sweet, and Alyson Stoner, as Sarah Baker, blooming from 'Tom Boy' into young womanhood, is a film standout, but too much of the film devotes itself to an almost 'sitcom' level ""Father-Is-An-Idiot"" slapstick, the kind of stuff that Steve Martin has spent much of his career movingaway from. One assumes that with his rewarding but much riskier""Shopgirl"" playing at theaters, Martin decided to 'play it safe' with a sure moneymaker, just in case...With the expected 'having a baby at the WORST possible time' finale, ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"" ends, as it began...pleasant, but predictable.It certainly COULD have been far better!",3,Sequel to 2003 Hit Lacks Original's Charm...,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,2295,"['Cheaper', 'Dozen', '2', ""'by-the-numbers"", 'sequel', 'SteveMartin/Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'hit', '2003', 'up', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'dad', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Martin', 'now', ""'house"", 'father', 'unhappily', 'deals', 'children', 'increasing', 'independence', 'Oldest', 'daughter', 'Nora', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'VERY', 'pregnant', 'not', '2003', ""'flame"", 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'passed', 'sequel', 'move', 'husband', 'new', 'city', 'oldest', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'taking', 'break', 'Smallville', 'contemplating', 'future', 'away', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'Daughter', 'Lorraine', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'irritating', 'one-dimensional', ""'d"", 'been', 'original', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'leave', 'family', 'attend', 'college', 'cross-country', 'BIG', 'changes', 'are', 'afoot', 'Tom', 'IS', ""N'T"", 'happy', 'could', 'make', 'serious', 'warm', 'family', 'comedy', 'vein', 'Parenthood', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'preferring', ""'quick"", 'bucks', ""'kid-friendly"", 'slapstick-themed', 'farce', 'would', 'generate', 'quickly', 'film', 'Meatballs', 'mode', 'Martin', 'underused', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'taking', 'kids', 'last', ""'family"", 'vacation', 'lake', 'retreat', ""'d"", 'used', 'disastrously', 'years', 'earlier', 'Back', 'then', 'Tom', 'had', 'ended', 'upcompeting', 'smarmy', 'Jimmy', 'Murtaugh', 'brood', 'sure', 'enough', 'AGAIN', 'run', 'now-rich', 'Murtaugh', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'doing', 'usual', ""'schtick"", ""'trophy"", 'wife', 'Sarina', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Carmen', 'Electra', ""'over-trained"", 'children', 'again', 'leading', 'expected', 'competition', 'LOTS', 'pratfall', 'opportunities', 'Martin.A', 'budding', 'romance', 'Welling', 'Charlie', 'Anne', 'Murtaugh', 'Jaime', 'King', 'returning', ""G'-rated"", 'fare', 'sex-and-violence-drenched', 'Sin', 'City', 'sweet', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'Sarah', 'Baker', 'blooming', ""'Tom"", 'Boy', 'young', 'womanhood', 'film', 'standout', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'almost', 'level', 'Father-Is-An-Idiot', 'slapstick', 'kind', 'stuff', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'spent', 'much', 'career', 'movingaway', 'One', 'rewarding', 'much', 'riskier', 'Shopgirl', 'playing', 'theaters', 'Martin', 'decided', ""'play"", 'safe', 'sure', 'moneymaker', 'just', 'case', 'expected', ""'having"", 'baby', 'WORST', 'possible', 'time', 'finale', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', '2', 'ends', 'began', 'pleasant', 'certainly', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better']",N/A

Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is a tame family movie with tame jokes, predictable plot and is overall an uninspired movie.  Still, your kids will probably enjoy it and you will have a tolerable time watching it with them.The plot is simple, Steve Martin's family (I can't even remember their name) goes to the lake for Labor Day and meets up with childhood rival Murtaugh played by Eugene Levy.  Levy's also has a big family and the entire movie consists of a rivalry between Martin and Levy.  There are snippets of scenes between the kids, who all seem to like each other.Now for some quick comments on various parts of the movie:  All of the kids have gotten a few years older and less cute.  Some of them are lucky to be in the movie at all.  Hilary Duff looks like a skelaton with skin.  She looks gaunt and kind of creepy.  Tom Welling deserves to be in much better movies that his.

You know what to expect from seeing the first movie and this one delivers a well done sequel that does a good job in supplying a story that is different, but consistent with what we liked about the Baker family.Dad is retired from his football coaching job.  How he pulls this off when they are still strapped for cash is something you don't want to think about.  Especially when he can supply a family vacation or go off and buy a bunch of power tools at the drop of a hat, but the kids still struggle to get tuition paid and so forth.  One of the best features of the films is the positive and warm relationship between the parents.  Tom and Kate Baker (Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt) obviously still have passion and affection for each other and really enjoy each of their children.The theme in this movie has a lot to do with kids maturing and moving into those areas of life where they need their parents less and less.  The main plot point has to do with an old personal rivalry between Tom Baker and the Jimmy Murtaugh (Eugene Levy).  Their families have competed over the years and the Murtaugh's have generally won the encounters because of Jimmy's burning passion to prove he is as good as the popular Tom Baker.  Jimmy has become a huge financial success.  His kids seem like fine people and are quite successful.  However, Jimmy is on his third wife, who is also a nice person but knows she is a trophy wife, and there is more going on with his kids than Jimmy understands.How the two large families interact is the source of most of the comedy in the movie and the way the kids interact does a lot to affect the continuing rivalry between their dads.The movie has some very sentimental moments.

It was almost like a wedding, or something, it was so huge.  Come on!!!  And we're supposed to believe somehow Mr. Baker got all 12 kids there, but 1/2 of them have to leave 5 minutes after the party starts?  Now that's just asinine!  Or how about the family members standing up, and making some kind of toast or speech for the graduate.  Not sure if they ralize this, but graduating from High School, is not that big of a feat.  If they had her graduate at the very top of her class, that would have been significant.Same reasoning passes on to having the whole family show up for the vacation.  Okay, the writer put a little thought into, and made many unwilling to come, but they still showed up.  Its movies like this, that make my good highschool friend, Bobby Asslong, think this is normal behavior.  Of course, this type of scenario, rarely happens in real life.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","With oldest daughter Nora (Piper Perabo) married, pregnant and moving to Houston and Lorraine (Hilary Duff) just graduated and moving to New York, patriarch Tom Baker (Steve Martin) feels life quickly passing him by and decides to have one last outing with the whole family intact. Accordingly, the Banks clan goes vacationing to Lake Wanetka. There, Tom is reluctantly reacquainted with his old rival Jimmy Murtaugh (Eugene Levy) and his annoyingly perfect family (though, in due time, we find out there is something rotten in Boulders). It's not too long before Tom's competitive juices are flowing and he and Murtaugh are trading snide, snarky comments and pettily battling to top each other in campfire songs, in tennis, and, ultimately, in the annual Labor Day Cup Event.The whole gang from the first movie is back and comfortably slips into the old, familiar roles. Steve Martin once again mines the family comedy vault of uncomplicated humor and shtick. As Tom Baker, Martin is wackily distraught, sentimental, and unwilling to let go of his maturing offsprings - basically, he's being a normal dad, and Eugene Levy matches him hangup for hangup. The excellent Bonnie Hunt, with her quiet, good-humored takes, predictably shines as Kate Baker. The film strays from the evil stepmother cliche as Carmen Electra plays Murtaugh's third wife as a sweet, understanding woman, who seems to genuinely care for her husband and step-family. Because of the immense cast, Tom Welling, Piper Perabo,  Hilary Duff and others don't have enough screen time to strut their stuff. However, special mention must go out to young scene stealer Alyson Stoner (Sarah Baker), the tomboyish prankster who teeters on the brink of girlish teenhood and has her first ever crush. She probably was the best actor of the lot.I've read the wonderful book by Frank B. Gilbreth and had seen the original 1950 Cheaper by the Dozen starring Clifton Webb and the great Myrna Loy. I saw the later version with Steve Martin and thought it highly diverting. This feel-good sequel is marked with the same easy-going sense of fun, warmth and mirth that permeated the first movie. What can you expect from this film? Well, let's see...predictable hijinks, predicaments you see a mile off, a crazed Steve Martin escalating situations to the point where you're just cringing (the movie theatre scene, for example), and, finally, quick blanket resolutions ending in hugs and handshakes, and a once-again harmonious family or two. Even the given villain has his eyes opened and transforms into a semi-softie. Harmless and good-natured, Cheaper by the Dozen 2 may not have the vaunted zany Steve Martin comedy stylings, but, c'mon, you really didn't expect him to bust out with a ""King Tut"" rendition, did you?",4,Taming the wild and crazy guy,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,2770,"['oldest', 'daughter', 'Nora', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'married', 'pregnant', 'moving', 'Houston', 'Lorraine', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'just', 'graduated', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'patriarch', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'life', 'quickly', 'passing', 'decides', 'have', 'one', 'last', 'outing', 'whole', 'family', 'intact', 'Accordingly', 'Banks', 'clan', 'vacationing', 'Lake', 'Wanetka', 'Tom', 'reluctantly', 'reacquainted', 'old', 'rival', 'Jimmy', 'Murtaugh', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'annoyingly', 'perfect', 'family', 'due', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'something', 'rotten', 'Boulders', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'Tom', 'competitive', 'juices', 'are', 'flowing', 'Murtaugh', 'are', 'trading', 'snide', 'snarky', 'comments', 'pettily', 'battling', 'top', 'other', 'campfire', 'songs', 'tennis', 'ultimately', 'annual', 'Labor', 'Day', 'Cup', 'Event.The', 'whole', 'gang', 'first', 'movie', 'back', 'comfortably', 'slips', 'old', 'familiar', 'roles', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'once', 'again', 'family', 'comedy', 'vault', 'uncomplicated', 'humor', 'shtick', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Martin', 'wackily', 'distraught', 'sentimental', 'unwilling', 'let', 'go', 'maturing', 'offsprings', 'basically', 'being', 'normal', 'dad', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'hangup', 'hangup', 'excellent', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'quiet', 'good-humored', 'predictably', 'shines', 'Kate', 'Baker', 'film', 'strays', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'cliche', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'Murtaugh', 'third', 'wife', 'sweet', 'understanding', 'woman', 'who', 'genuinely', 'care', 'husband', 'step-family', 'immense', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'strut', 'stuff', 'However', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'go', 'out', 'young', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'Sarah', 'Baker', 'tomboyish', 'prankster', 'who', 'brink', 'girlish', 'teenhood', 'first', 'ever', 'crush', 'probably', 'was', 'best', 'actor', 'lot.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'wonderful', 'book', 'Frank', 'B.', 'Gilbreth', 'had', 'seen', 'original', '1950', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'starring', 'Clifton', 'Webb', 'great', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'saw', 'later', 'version', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'thought', 'highly', 'diverting', 'feel-good', 'sequel', 'marked', 'same', 'easy-going', 'sense', 'fun', 'warmth', 'mirth', 'permeated', 'first', 'movie', 'What', 'can', 'expect', 'film', 'Well', 'let', 'see', 'predictable', 'hijinks', 'predicaments', 'see', 'mile', 'off', 'crazed', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'escalating', 'situations', 'point', 'where', ""'re"", 'just', 'cringing', 'movie', 'theatre', 'scene', 'example', 'finally', 'quick', 'blanket', 'resolutions', 'ending', 'hugs', 'handshakes', 'once-again', 'harmonious', 'family', 'two', 'Even', 'given', 'villain', 'eyes', 'opened', 'transforms', 'semi-softie', 'Harmless', 'good-natured', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', '2', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'vaunted', 'zany', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'comedy', 'stylings', ""c'mon"", 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'bust', 'out', 'King', 'Tut', 'rendition', 'did']",N/A

So I put it on for my niece and actually myself sitting down watching it too.  Most of it we've seen before. Eugene Levy (American Pie) is surprisingly not bad here in a role I don't think I ever seen him in. I mean he plays a rich stud or at least a guy that thinks he's all that. He just happens to have a lot of kids as well. Steve Martin thinks he has to compete with him and obsessed with his kids beating his kids in races. One scene where Martin trys to show off water skiing reminds me a lot of John Candy's water skiing scene in the Great Out Doors. Plus you know one of his kids will fall for Levy's kids and that two parents will be against it. We've seen that a lot in movies especially all the Romeo and Juliet movies.Still, although the movie may be predictable with not much originality, I can't really call it bad. Steve Martin has charm and is funny as always. While like I said it's funny seeing Levy as a cool and in shape dad that thinks he's all that. It's funny that he even pulls the part off. Smallville's Tom Welling though might as well not even come back if there's a part 3. The films just show him when they feel like it. He disapears and reapears a lot in this movie. I had to keep reminding myself he was even in it. While the talented Piper Perabo (Cayote Ugly)  as Martin's pregnant daughter is pretty much wasted here too.

973456,APEBIS3MFYMPE,B000EHSVFU,M. Cotter,"[31, 37]","I truly enjoyed this movie - and wouldn't hesitate to allow some of my young children to see it! There is no foul language, and dating and first crush situations were handled very tastefully - and even with a flair of innocence about them! I happen to be the oldest of 7, my husband is one of 8, and together we have 5 children - so we are very much pro big families. It is very refreshing to see a positive story involving not one, but TWO large families! In this day and age where society pushes the idea that 1 or 2 children makes the perfect family, this movie gives the viewer a fairly accurate glimpse of what life can be like with many more siblings. Of course there will be times of difficulty and disagreements, but there is also plenty of love to go around, and this is the ultimate conclusion of this movie - in BOTH families! There are many lessons to be learned in this film - not the least of which is the need to have a clear vision of what is more important in life. Both fathers in this story are struggling with competitiveness that has become an obsession, but I found it truly moving when Steve Martin's character chooses to forfeit the final tie-breaking event because of the potential risk to his 9-months-pregnant daughter. His was the choice of a true champion, and in the end, both fathers come to recognize that their families are so much more important than winning another trophy! What a truly refreshing message to families and young people who are being bombarded with messages of ""me first"" and ""look out for number one!""I most certainly do not regret the time and money spent to see this film!

973459,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000EHSVFU,MollyRK,"[13, 15]","I was basically shocked as all heck when I saw a trailer for this movie on TV over the holidays. Given the modest success of the first film, I was surprised they were going for a sequel. I was even more shocked that the bigger stars like Hilary Duff and Tom Welling returned for this, but somehow the timing was good enough for all fourteen original characters to reprise their roles.After seeing ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"" quite a few times in the theater this Christmas, I have to say that it was very nicely done and certainly outdid the 2003 film.It's not anything that's going to win an Oscar or be discussed in passing years from now, but then again it wasn't trying to be either of those things. It was released as a clean, lighthearted movie, ideal for a day at the movies with the kids over the holiday break from school, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.Don't get me wrong, I watched the first ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" in 2003 and liked it well enough. But right off the bat, the one element of this sequel that sets it gloriously apart from the original, and that's the general attitude of the Baker children. Remember how bratty they were three years ago, treating their parents like dirt, treating one another like dirt, and pulling juvenile pranks left and right? Well, now they're a little older, they get along with each other, and they're actually nice to their parents. It makes for a much more relaxing and enjoyable viewing experience with less children screaming and acting up.The premise for this sequel finds Tom and Kate (played perfectly, once again, by Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt) finding that with their three oldest children stepping out of the nest and the remaining nine becoming more involved in their own activities, it would be a good idea to get the whole family together for one last summer at the lake house. Sounds good....that is, until we meet Jimmy Murtaugh (played quite nicely by Eugene Levy), who has a large family of his own and is determined to strike up another heated competition with his longtime rival Tom Baker.As I said before, the Baker kids are much more likable this time around, and each are presented differently in the film. First off we have:Nora, who is now married (not to Ashton Kutcher, haha) and pregnant with her first child. Perabo does a nice job here; she and her husband are funny and sweet to watch together, and Perabo contributes to a very heartwarming final scene at the end of the movie.Charlie, a college student working to pay off loans and trying hard to please his parents, all while attempting to figure out his ""next move"" in life. ""Smallville"" star Tom Welling puts forth a good and modest performance, just as he did in the first film.Lorraine, whose graduation opens the film and introduces her plan to pursue an internship in New York in the fall. The return of the infamous Hilary Duff is probably the most surprising part of the movie, but it was nice that she came back for this and helped get the sequel made. Her number of scenes are small and spread out, and she seems a bit bored most of the time, but Lorraine has a few nice interactions with younger sister Sarah that help demonstrate Duff's ability to get into character, an especially notable feat with such a large cast.Henry, Jake, Mark and Mike, the four middle sons, who aren't given much to do in this movie except a few lines here and there.Sarah, the third-oldest preteen daughter seeking her own independence and developing her first crush on none other than one of Jimmy Murtaugh's sons. Roger Ebert said it, a myriad of other big-time movie reviewers have said it, and I'm not going to deny it: Young actress Alyson Stoner delivers what is arguably the movie's most heartfelt and well-done performance in this role. The scene where she goes out on her first date literally brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it, and even though the storyline about a tomboy plunging head-first into adolescence and finding her very first crush is nothing new, it is still something that practically every woman can relate to. It's a somewhat cliched character analysis, yes, but Stoner plays it so sweetly and with such youthful innocence, she absolutely makes the entire movie. This actress really comes into her own with this role, and I genuinely hope to see more from her in the future.Twin daughters Jessica and Kim, too, don't have much of a personal storyline to play off of, but actresses Liliana Mumy and Morgan York do well enough with what they are given. The only thing I'd have to say about them is that the writers clearly tried way too hard to give them witty lines and funny things to say in unison (e.g. ""Lay off, Dad!"" and ""We agree to participate!"") and in the end it didn't quite work. The little girls playing the parts are cute, though, especially the red-headed Liliana Mumy. She's another one with a distinctively expressive personality and cute face that could land her roles in other movies.The two youngest Baker kids, identical twins Kyle and Nigel, probably stand right behind Alyson Stoner as the next best thing about the movie. Those are the same adorable faces you see on the television series ""Desperate Housewives,"" and even though they don't have much to do in this film either, they melt your heart whenever they come onto the screen.Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt do a terrific job in their scenes, as well; both of them seem custom-made for the roles as nurturing parents, and they work very well together as on-screen husband and wife. With all the chaotic events going on with the kids, the two of them portray a very special lesson for viewers with the amazing love that they still have for one another. Eugene Levy and Carmen Electra round out the main cast, both playing their roles with humor and ease, and all in all this is a nice movie that handles its overwhelming cast much better this time around. The 12 kids were basically a train wreck in the first movie, running around and getting into all sorts of trouble, but now they are more fleshed out and established in the plot.  It is funny, appealing, and yes, even touching, all while outdoing the original 2003 film and remaining more than ideal for parents to enjoy with their children.",5,a surprise sequel with great

Surprisingly every single member of the original cast comes back and plays the exact same character, just as well. The idea of a big family coming together for one last reuinon, as many are going their seperate ways I enjoy and sympathize with as the same thing is happening to my family.Seeing the cast come back and get new storylines (well actually only Steve and 4 of the kids) was good as it shows there is more potential for these people and how, they can be developed well and still be identifiable. The slight changes to characters make sense, although I'm surprised at how easily Loranne (Hilerey Duff) seems to have drifted from her family, while back in the first one she appeared to be the only person, no one complained about, minus Sarah in ONE scene.The Murtaugh's family is nice to watch, but a few of the conflicts are hard to grasp, as we don't get as much from the family and much of it results off the actions of the Baker's. Plus they are 10 members and we really only see 4 of them (Jimmy, Elliot, Sarina (wife) and Anne) get developed, although we do get brief moments establishing Mark's pal (Kenneth) and Calvin the oldest.Nora's husbend Brad, I can't really comment on him that much, as we don't get much from him, but he seems very likeable and everyone in the family appears to like him also.The conflicts in this movie are easier to predict, but enjoyable, though probubly not by as many. Humorous moments I think are even better in this movie as there is more to work with this time. Although I didn't need that movie theater scene ""The move"" honestly. And actually Jimmy being there is approeite as Ice Age is actually PG not G (not that it really matters for THAT movie).How the conficts resolve, was actually pretty clever, I had (Spoiler alert) completly forgot Nora was pregnent.

Steve Martin must love money, and what I can only imagine was a short, painless shoot, given the singular locale of a camp lake, its ninety-minute length and scenes so poorly covered and acted you can only assume the first take was printed.Martin's awful, this movie is stone, and about the fourth to pretend Bonnie Hunt's superiority complex is wisdom in disguise. Hollywood is following the lead of TV sitcoms and mass-processing stories of idiot men and their sage wives (often accompanied by sage daughters, though not here). The way ""Cheaper By The Dozen 2"" presents it, football coach Tom Baker (Martin) might have eaten his twelve kids whole were it not for Kate (Hunt).Both resolve to take the clan to the lakehouse for one last summer before the second-oldest Lorraine (Hilary Duff, down to 44 pounds) heads to New York. The resort is also home to the Murtaugh family, led by patriarch Jimmy (Eugene Levy) who, if you unpack it all, must see Tom as a some kind of Daisy Buchanan, given the obscene, competitive life he's led just to pummel an old acquaintance into the dirt at the annual family sports competition.It is inevitable that a few Bakers will grow smitten with a few Murtaughs, that a screwball ending awaits - there's a reason oldest daughter Nora (Piper Perabo) is pregnant - that Tom will browbeat his kids for the competition only to lose their love (then -oho! - get it back).

And sure there are a couple of stupid scenes that should have been left out, but not too bad so that your 8-year old can probably still watch it without asking too many questions. Eugene Levy (probably not as well known by his name to too many folks) is excellent and I like him goofing off even more than Martin for the most part.The storyline is about two extended families that apparently had a type of rivalry going on for many years, and now they meet at that particular lake again and on labor day they have a family competition there and so on. While Martin plays the loving Baker dad who's not too well off financially, Levy plays the now wealthy Murtaugh dad who's on his third marriage (with Carmen Elektra as number 3) and who owns most of the land around the lake.The only problem I can see is that much of the fun is predictable, but there are still a number of hearty laughs. It's a relaxing family movie and you just wish that it was summer out there and you too could go for a swim and/or so some water skiing in a lake instead of the apres ski.

973472,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000EHSVFU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[7, 14]","Of course, this is a rhetorical question. I already know the answer: ""Cheaper By the Dozen"", starring Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hillary Duff and Tom Welling was a big hit in 2003. So much so, other studios began looking for similar projects, which is why our local multiplexes were recently inundated with the remake of ""Yours, Mine and Ours"", starring Dennis Quaid, Rene Russo and eighteen kids. ""Dozen"" was popular enough to warrant a sequel, which is why many parents and guardians are currently being subjected to ""Cheaper By The Dozen 2"", with the entire cast returning for ""sequel money"". But it seems a bit pass&eacute; doesn't it. They've already done 12 kids, the competing film had eighteen, and you can't have a sequel with just 12 kids again. How to one up the competition?Dad (Steve Martin) and Mom (Bonnie Hunt) realize their family is drifting away. Nora (Piper Perabo), their oldest, is pregnant......And apparently somnambulant, as the viewer will completely forget she is in the film, even when she is on screen......and her husband......Not Ashton Kutcher; either they couldn't afford him or he had better sense. My guess is the latter......will soon move to Houston, for his job. Charlie (Tom Welling, TV's ""Smallville"") is working in a garage to pay off his student loans. Lorraine (Hilary Duff)......Eat some food, Hilary. You don't look healthy and you are a role model to many, many pre-teen girls. Not a good image......has just graduated from high school and will soon move to New York for an internship at Allure Magazine......The product placement is very subtle. More on that later......So Mom and Dad decide the entire Baker clan needs to make one last trip to the old lake house and have one last summer of fun. Upon arrival, Dad learns that Murtaugh (Eugene Levy), his old summer rival, has been buying up every property around the lake. Soon, their old rivalries heat up and the Baker Twelve are soon competing against the Murtaugh Eight for the prize of best summer ever. Bingo. There we go. ""Cheaper By The Dozen 2"" actually has twenty kids, one dog and Carmen Electra. We have a winner for most excessive and pointless casting.If Steve Martin only made these types of films, I would be more upset. But because he balances these terrible, overly broad, overly commercial projects with smaller, more interesting, better made films like ""Shop Girl"", ""The Spanish Prisoner"" and ""L.A. Story"", I am willing to give him a little slack. But only just a little. Steve Martin is a funny guy and to watch him in these bad films is just painful. As Tom Baker, he consistently shouts, yells, gestures with his arms, flails about, in short, acts crazy. In the real world, this guy would never be allowed to raise 12 kids. After four or five kids, I would hope Child Protective Services would rush in and get a court order for a mandatory vasectomy. My beef with Martin's involvement is that he could make these films better. Maybe not great, but at least pleasant for the adults to sit through. Instead, he allows the filmmakers to throw in food jokes, children acting crazy, broad comedy and more. Martin is at the point in his career where he can wield some of his power. He should be able to say ""You know what, let's try this instead."" At the very least, he could insist on another rewrite before committing to the project.You know a film is going to be bad when Carmen Electra turns out to be the most natural adult in the bunch. With Martin's arms flailing about and face breaking into broad maniacal, cartoonish grins, Levy's posturing and harrumphing and Hunt's apparent boredom with her role, Electra actually makes an attempt at being a real human, a real adult. She plays Levy's third wife and doesn't like the way he interacts with his children. She looks to Hunt's character for guidance. Yeah, it's as boring as it sounds.I have two problems with Hilary Duff's character. First, she doesn't look healthy, like she has lost a lot of weight. This doesn't present a good image to all of the many `tween' girls who look up to her. Second, her character's internship at ""Allure Magazine"" is an excuse to work in a product placement for the magazine. In every scene, anytime someone sees Lorraine (Duff), she is reading a copy of the magazine, to ""study and prepare for her internship"". Yeah, right. Uh-huh.The film is very formulaic and seems to follow the same basic outline as the previous film. Yes, they have changed the setting, but there are still animals running about causing havoc, children getting into trouble in fairly dangerous ways and parents who seem to stand back and just laugh it off. If it ain't broke, right? Well, just because ""Dozen"" made money doesn't mean it wasn't broke. Yet, because it made money, they decided to stick close to the original. The only deviation is the addition of Murtaugh's eight children. Naturally, they had to best the competition. I hate to see what they have planned for ""Cheaper By The Dozen 3"". Perhaps, the Baker family sets out to save an Austrian Orphanage from the Nazis. Martin could dress up as a nun and prance across the Alps singing ""The Hills Are Alive"" while his children soak Hitler's underwear in meat and send in their dog. They could single handedly win World War II. I better stop, or some studio executive might not realize I am leveling the sarcasm on with a trowel.I know it isn't necessary for a successful comedy to be overly broad and simplistic, yet Hollywood seems convinced this is the key to a successful comedy. Fill it with kids, a couple of animals, lots of food jokes and voila, instant success. Unfortunately, we, the American people seem to be proving them right.Why is it necessary to take kids to these bad films? It only serves to make them less discerning and capable of appreciating the truly great films.

However, I still think it would be ok to let small kids see it.I know that there are probably some actors or actresses in this movie that people don't like, but I think that fact can be overlooked.

It was humorous, had great messages, and was a great film not only for families but at displaying how families should work together. However, when I saw the previews for CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2 I thought to myself, &#34;Why didn't they just leave good enough alone.&#34; (A: $).CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2 takes place a few years after the first film. Nora (Piper Perabo) is married with a child on the way, Charlie (Tom Welling) is on his own, and Lorraine (Hillary Duff)is graduating from high school and preparing to move to New York.Tom (Steve Martin) sees his family splitting up and though he knows it must happen, he wants to take the family out to the old summer lake house and spend one last season all together. Upon arrival, Tom runs into his old nemesis, Jimmy Murtaugh (Eugene Levy) and the two are soon competing against each other in a wide variety of ways.CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2 is a good family movie. There isn't any foul language, sex, or violence. It stays true to the 1st film's original message about the strength of family and delivers a couple of other lessons as well. Despite all of this, CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2 is just an average movie. The story isn't that engaging, the acting not that challenging, and all kinds of classic comedy gags. It's a movie that families can enjoy together, but one that really shouldn't have been made.",3,"Entertaining, But Unnecessary",1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,1407,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'CHEAPER', 'BY', 'THE', 'DOZEN', 'was', 'humorous', 'had', 'great', 'messages', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'families', 'displaying', 'how', 'families', 'should', 'work', 'together', 'However', 'when', 'saw', 'previews', 'CHEAPER', 'BY', 'THE', 'DOZEN', '2', 'thought', 'myself', '34', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'good', 'enough', 'alone.', '34', '.CHEAPER', 'BY', 'THE', 'DOZEN', '2', 'place', 'few', 'years', 'first', 'film', 'Nora', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'married', 'child', 'way', 'Charlie', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'own', 'Lorraine', 'Hillary', 'Duff', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'preparing', 'move', 'New', 'York.Tom', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'family', 'splitting', 'up', 'must', 'happen', 'take', 'family', 'old', 'summer', 'lake', 'house', 'spend', 'one', 'last', 'season', 'together', 'arrival', 'Tom', 'old', 'nemesis', 'Jimmy', 'Murtaugh', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'two', 'are', 'soon', 'competing', 'other', 'wide', 'variety', 'ways.CHEAPER', 'BY', 'THE', 'DOZEN', '2', 'good', 'family', 'movie', ""n't"", 'foul', 'language', 'sex', 'violence', 'true', '1st', 'film', 'original', 'message', 'strength', 'family', 'couple', 'other', 'lessons', 'well', 'CHEAPER', 'BY', 'THE', 'DOZEN', '2', 'just', 'average', 'movie', 'story', ""n't"", 'engaging', 'acting', 'not', 'challenging', 'kinds', 'classic', 'comedy', 'gags', 'movie', 'families', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'one', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made']",N/A

After the first movie, and with this wonderful cast, I thougt this would be much funnier than it is.  My kids were a bit disappointed, too, for the same reason.  That being said, I did think it was touching to see them dealing with the kids growing up and wanting to go off and do their own thing, while the parents want the kids to stick around and be ""kids.""  It's a good movie to rent, but I wouldn't buy it because I don't see any of us wanting to watch it over and over.  I did enjoy the performances of Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt.
