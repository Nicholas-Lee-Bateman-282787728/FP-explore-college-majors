While this was made in the 80's, the two-part high society series holds up extremely well in the 21st century.  It features one of Ann-Margrets most powerful acting roles and very deserving of an Emmy Award.  Instead, her co-star, Claudette Cobert, who also turns in a strong performance, got that honor.  Without spoiling the story, this one is filled with greed and tragedy.Nice production values.

1320871,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B00347AIRQ,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[11, 11]","I had pretty much worn out my VHS copy of this movie which I taped from the original telecast back in 1987 and was very glad to see that ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"" finally made it to DVD. The unfortunate part is that it appears to have been made using a video master, not a film negative. The quality is passable, and still much better than watching my VHS! On the positive side, the quality of the production and casting would make it hard to believe that this was a Made-for-TV movie. The story is based on thenovelof the same name by Dominick Dunne, which was inspired by the story of the real-life Woodwards. Dunne's book liberally borrowed from the real-life story as well as Truman Capote's fictionalized account in his novelAnswered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel. For the REAL story, the best book to read isThis Crazy Thing Called Loveby Susan Braudy. The real story is even more compelling (and tragic) than the one Dunne wrote about and is shown here. The plot of this movie is about Billy Grenville (Stephen Collins), a trust-fund baby who meets a showgirl, Ann Arden (Ann-Margret) during World War II. They instantly fall in love despite the differences in their social backgrounds. Things come to a head when Ann meets Billy's mother (Claudette Colbert) and sisters. Polite on the surface, Mrs. Grenville still makes it subtly clear that Ann does not fit in and obviously not part of their world. As Ann looks at a picture of the Queen Mother at Mrs. Grenville's house, she finds what she thinks is a common bond: ""We both like to display photos of celebrities!"" Mrs. Grenville is quick to correct her by telling Ann that only the photos of intimate friends can be seen in the Grenville home. Claudette Colbert is pitch perfect here covering up her slight with the veneer of social grace that is part of her world.Overcome with passion for Ann who is so different from what he is used to, Billy Grenville marries her anyway. Despite loving her as she is, Ann is scared of losing Billy and does all that she can to fit in with the Grenville family; in fact, she tries much too hard, becoming a joke in high society circles as an ostentatious social climber.The marriage unravels and finally comes to a head one fateful night when Billy confronts Ann about her hidden past. Revealing what he has discovered, Ann is pushed into a corner. Her next move binds her to the Grenville family forever, as they choose to cover up an unpleasant public scandal. The moral of the story: money doesn't buy happiness or love.Is this a new plot? Not at all, but it is expertly told her. Compelling to watch, the performances are riveting. Ann-Margret is amazing; you never know what to think of her character; is she a calculating social climber or a sweet midwestern farmgirl who misguidedly chooses the wrong path to keep her husband happy? By not knowing the answer, the movie becomes even more fascinating to watch. Stephen Collins is appropriately wooden, garnering very little sympathy for his silver-spooned character. Not surprisingly, Claudette Colbert, in her final role, won a Golden Globe. Marvin Hamlisch's music provides a lush period underscore that enhances the movie. The costuming by Donald Brooks & Susan Yellen is also fantastic, capturing the essence of the 1940's & 1950's. At times, the script is a little flimsy, betraying the high quality of the production, but this is easily overlooked by the top-notch cast.The movie itself is closer to 5 stars; because of the video quality (and the fact that it occasionally sticks) and lack of extras, I decided to give it a 4. Whatever you do, do not assume that this movie is an accurate account of the real-life Woodwards. Much is changed and much is left-out.

I remembered seeing it when it was originally broadcast, more than 20 years ago. At the time, I found it to be a rather glitzy soap opera with an interesting theme. The one thing that disturbed me the most was Ann-Margret . Seeing it again, my original reaction was reinforced. The main reason to see this film is the performance of Claudette Colbert!  She is utterly believable in the role of Alice Grenville. Every nuance, every gesture rings true! Also worthy of praise is Penny Fuller as one of the Grenville sisters. The rest of the cast has been dircected in such a campy way it is tiresome to watch. For some reason , whenever there is a glossy soap set about the rich and famous, all the people are portrayed as caricatures with ridiculously  exaggerated  mannerisms. The worst is Ann-Margret! Not once is she believable and she is hampered by a wig designer who should be banned from film sets forever! Her performance is SO bad is laughable when not downright boring. I have seen her do other things and enjoyed her in them, but this has got to be the worst I have seen. THOSE AWFUL WIGS!!!!!! So obvious!!Anyway, it is worth seeing for Miss Colbert. My only real regret is that there is not enough of Miss Colbert on the screen. She steals every scene she is in without trying.

1320876,A27NTH2Y9DAR31,B00347AIRQ,Schuyler V. Johnson,"[34, 36]","This is the story of the Woodward marriage gone terribly awry. Ann had been a person of wwhat can only be termed low estate; she was light years beneath the Woodward family; Elsie Woodward took an insant loathing to her future daughter in law as did everyone else in her social circle and Ann felt this keenly and harbored ill will and felt like an alien.The day after the murder, at a luncheon, the Duchess of Windsor remarked ""Nothing like a murder in the country to cure what ails you.""Elsie wrote checks totalling over $400,000.00 to end the criminal investigation. All the family and friends came together and closed ranks to protect Ann, the woman they despised, in order to prevent any scandal.The boys suffered the most, as children always do, and were shipped off to Switzerland to Le Rosey an exclusive all boys school (since gone co-ed).*Note: My brother, Tracy, attended Rosey at the same time Woody did (the older son) and I met him, and thought he was very shy and soft spoken and seemed sad. I was 10 years old and at that time, I had no idea about the shooting, and later when I found out, I felt so bad and wished, in hindsight, I could have done something to help him.Truman Capote called Ann Miss Bang Bang to which she responded with a derogatory comment on his personal lifestyle. He also wrote a story (the characters thinly disguised) re the murder for Esquire magazine which eventually led to her suicide.Elsie commented: ""Well, that's that; she shot my son and Truman has just murdered her, and so now I suppose we don't have to worry about that anymore.""Afterwards, Jimmy, the younger son, jumped out of a window to his death and many years later, when it looked like he was having much success in his life, marriage, child, but then divorced, Woody also took a leap from a window.The movie is superb, Claudette Colbert is Elsie Woodward and wonderful in the part; upon hearing she would be asked to test for the part, she refused and stated she did not need to test for any part. She was hired without being tested.Ann Margret is Ann and she is brilliant in the role, and also very beautiful of course, we see what attracted Billy to her in the first place.Billy is played by Stephen Collins and he is fabulous in the part; a true doomed gentleman.John Rubenstein plays Bratsie Bleeker, his best friend, who meets his own doom before Billy and that affected Billy very deeply who had a prescience about his own death.Ann and Billy had been at a party for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor that fateful night (the Duchess was the only member of society who accepted Ann, perhaps because she too had come from a different background than her husband) and everyone discussed the mysterious burglar who prowled the estates on Oyster Bay, Long Island and this was the springboard from which the story was concocted to explain the shooting.The movie won 2 Emmy awards, nominated for 6 and won a Golden Globe for Ms Colbert.This story would never have been believed if it hadn't been true; it is high drama, high society and high tragedy, it is a brilliantly executed film and well worth seeing.""The rich are different from you and me.""Nick Carraway, from the Great GatsbyErnest Hemingway is said to have responded ""Yes, they have more money.""",5,True life soap opera tragedy of the super rich,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,3261,"['story', 'Woodward', 'marriage', 'gone', 'terribly', 'awry', 'Ann', 'had', 'been', 'person', 'wwhat', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'termed', 'low', 'estate', 'was', 'light', 'years', 'Woodward', 'family', 'Elsie', 'Woodward', 'took', 'insant', 'loathing', 'future', 'daughter', 'law', 'did', 'everyone', 'else', 'social', 'circle', 'Ann', 'felt', 'keenly', 'harbored', 'ill', 'will', 'felt', 'alien.The', 'day', 'murder', 'luncheon', 'Duchess', 'Windsor', 'remarked', 'Nothing', 'murder', 'country', 'cure', 'what', 'Elsie', 'wrote', 'checks', 'totalling', '400,000.00', 'end', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'family', 'friends', 'came', 'together', 'closed', 'ranks', 'protect', 'Ann', 'woman', 'despised', 'order', 'prevent', 'scandal.The', 'boys', 'suffered', 'most', 'children', 'always', 'do', 'were', 'shipped', 'off', 'Switzerland', 'Le', 'Rosey', 'exclusive', 'boys', 'school', 'gone', 'co-ed', '*Note', 'brother', 'Tracy', 'attended', 'Rosey', 'same', 'time', 'Woody', 'did', 'older', 'son', 'met', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'shy', 'soft', 'spoken', 'seemed', 'sad', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'had', 'idea', 'shooting', 'later', 'when', 'found', 'felt', 'so', 'bad', 'wished', 'hindsight', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'help', 'him.Truman', 'Capote', 'called', 'Ann', 'Miss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'responded', 'derogatory', 'comment', 'personal', 'lifestyle', 'also', 'wrote', 'story', 'characters', 'thinly', 'disguised', 're', 'murder', 'Esquire', 'magazine', 'eventually', 'led', 'suicide.Elsie', 'commented', 'Well', 'shot', 'son', 'Truman', 'just', 'murdered', 'so', 'now', 'suppose', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'anymore', 'Afterwards', 'Jimmy', 'younger', 'son', 'jumped', 'window', 'death', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'looked', 'was', 'having', 'much', 'success', 'life', 'marriage', 'child', 'then', 'divorced', 'Woody', 'also', 'took', 'leap', 'window.The', 'movie', 'superb', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Elsie', 'Woodward', 'wonderful', 'part', 'hearing', 'would', 'be', 'asked', 'test', 'part', 'refused', 'stated', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'test', 'part', 'was', 'hired', 'being', 'tested.Ann', 'Margret', 'Ann', 'brilliant', 'role', 'also', 'very', 'beautiful', 'course', 'see', 'what', 'attracted', 'Billy', 'first', 'place.Billy', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'fabulous', 'part', 'true', 'doomed', 'gentleman.John', 'Rubenstein', 'Bratsie', 'Bleeker', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'own', 'doom', 'Billy', 'affected', 'Billy', 'very', 'deeply', 'who', 'had', 'prescience', 'own', 'death.Ann', 'Billy', 'had', 'been', 'party', 'Duke', 'Duchess', 'Windsor', 'fateful', 'night', 'Duchess', 'was', 'only', 'member', 'society', 'who', 'accepted', 'Ann', 'perhaps', 'too', 'had', 'come', 'different', 'background', 'husband', 'everyone', 'discussed', 'mysterious', 'burglar', 'who', 'prowled', 'estates', 'Oyster', 'Bay', 'Long', 'Island', 'was', 'springboard', 'story', 'was', 'concocted', 'explain', 'shooting.The', 'movie', 'won', '2', 'Emmy', 'awards', 'nominated', '6', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Ms', 'Colbert.This', 'story', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'believed', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'true', 'high', 'drama', 'high', 'society', 'high', 'tragedy', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'rich', 'are', 'different', 'Nick', 'Carraway', 'Great', 'GatsbyErnest', 'Hemingway', 'said', 'have', 'responded', 'Yes', 'have', 'more', 'money']",N/A

The Dominick Dunne book was excellent and the mini-series also, just not as well done as the book. This mini-series is both well done and well-cast in all the roles, except that for me anyway; though the screen veteran Claudette Colbert did an adequate job as Alice Greenville, I think they could have done a better job of casting for this role. For me, Ms. Colbert was a bit too soft and not as the character depicted in the book. Claudette Colbert isn't in the film much, but when she is, watch out. I can't see any reason why she was awarded a Golden globe, except that she was up in age.Of course, as in any move based on a novel, there are a number of things not shown on screen. In fact, a great deal was left out and if you loved the book there may be a slight chance that you won't like this series. On the other hand, you might. I did. Ann Margret steals the show here and gives an excellent portrayal of the lost and confused Ann Arden. In the film, unlike the book, Billy starts out having affairs first without much of a reason, whereas in the book Ann starts having affairs first and then, Billy does because he finds out about her affairs. In the book, Billy has a reason to have his affairs, whereas in the film, he doesn't. For a mini-series of the anything goes 80's for when this aired, there was certainly a great deal more they could have aired on screen. I don't agree with some viewers that Collins was wooden here. I felt he did a fine job of bringing the confused playboy to life.I don't know who the other award nominees were for the year this year ran, but after viewing this, I have to say that in my opinion, Ann Margret definitely deserved to win an Emmy and Golden Globe for her performance. I'm not a fan of Ann Margret's, but I have no problem stating that she did a fantastic and believable job in her portrayal of Ann here. You grew to hate her, yet also sympathize with her plight.Overall, this is a film worth buying if you're a fan of Dunne's book and of the real life story of the infamous Woodward Shooting of the Century. I'm sure I'll watch this one over and over again.I received this new DVD direct from a Amazon seller and it plays nicely. Colors are crisp and vivid, though as with other DVDS audio is mixed: music is loud and conversations are low. The DVD arrived promptly and in condition new, as described.",4,Well cast; well done.
