While it is typical &#34;Found Footage&#34; style, the story is about as simple and as stripped down as it can get.  And that is what makes this Series GREAT!!!!!!The story revolves around a pair of sisters who seemingly have strange occourences/hauntings that happen around them.  The first half of each movie is a bit boring.  But this is the set up for the last half of each film as things get progressively freaky!So be prepaired to get literally scared with this trio of films!  And the great part is, they put them in one package so you can watch them one right after the other!Get your popcorn, your blanket, & make sure to be ready to be scared.

But by the time of the 2nd movie, it was already played out and you can see that they were trying to extend their one-hit wonder into a longer streak. But the way they did it, bringing back some of the previous characters, because yes, it actually was a prequel, I was a little interesting to find out how all of what happened in the first movie actually came about, but still not so great.

For having such low budgets, they do their job. They aren't supposed to be scary movies with heart warming endings.

Why did I make this list? Because I want to mention the fact that I LOVE HORROR MOVIES. But This franchise known as Paranormal Activity is crap. Part one consists of some lame noises, and a fire. Its barely worth your time if youve actually read up on the paranormal such as The Demonologist by Ed and Lorraine Warren. By the way I am an atheist, but even you can still enjoy the such a book, or another book such as Dark Sacrement, or a tv series like A Haunting for the fear factor. This movie invokes none of the fear that the TV show A Haunting, or the books I have mentioned does. Even the old music television show FEAR was scarier then this crap. You could enjoy the legends. If you want to be scared, go read one of the books ive mentioened. They have more books like that in the links section. If you want to see a lame bump in the night movie then this is it for you.
