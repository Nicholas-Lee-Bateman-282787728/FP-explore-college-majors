1641546,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00C2PO14C,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","If you are a connoisseur of SyFy network schlock, you watch their movies hoping for their next poorly made endeavor to transcend its own worst qualities to become what I like to call Bad Movie Magic. How does a film become Bad Movie Magic? There isn't really a formula, so to speak, the stars just sort of align. Usually, though, there is some combination of campy cast, wacky creatures, illogical plotting, and ludicrous dialogue. I must say that ""Killer Mountain"" is certainly not the worst made or worst acted movie to come from the SyFy stable. But I don't entirely mean that as a compliment. Without amping up the nuttiness factor, the movie simply becomes rather forgettable. The cast makes the most of what is given them (a deadly climb, an ancient legend, a terrible beastie), but the movie lacks the requisite humor to make it all very interesting. I was no big fan of the creature in this feature, it's fairly unremarkable as these things go. So what the movie really needed for entertainment factor was a great lead actor to ham things up. Overall, though, this is played far too seriously and it's a critical mistake.Aaron Douglas plays a legendary mountain climber. Now, I think Douglas is a solid character actor and has scored in other roles (most notably Battlestar Gallactica), but you won't look at him and think ""mountain climber!"" I wouldn't want to hold the end of a rope he was dangling off of, I'm just saying. He is reluctantly brought to Bhutan with his team by a wealthy businessman conducting a medical research excursion. His ex-wife (Emmanuella Vaugier) was leading the last mission up an unscalable mountain and that team has gone missing. Not just a rescue story, though, the plot deals with fountain of youth mythology and ancient lore about a monstrous protector of the caverns that hold this secret. The team must also contend with local authorities that want to control any possible find. In truth, it's all a bit much with these various plot threads. The movie could have been a modestly scaled success as a mountain climbing story. It simply has too many other elements at play. Of course, Vaugier is just hanging around unharmed. As they climb to reach her, people start getting picked off by the mountain, bad guys, unscrupulous locals, or the aforementioned creature. Man, this really is a Killer Mountain!In the end, the movie tries to play up the central relationship between these two leads. Vaugnier, who is so sexy and terrific on ""Lost Girl,"" has almost nothing to do and is way too hot for Douglas. The movie lacks humor, the creature is vague and uninspiring in creation, and I didn't much care about many of the plot threads. Of course, this being SyFy, I could also mention substandard CGI and other technical problems but those didn't bother me much. Where I disconnected with ""Killer Mountain"" was that I just didn't think it was much fun. If the suspense doesn't hold my attention, I want to laugh along with the silliness. Is ""Killer Mountain"" the most terrible movie to come from SyFy? Not even close. But it's not memorable either. And that is its biggest problem, just too generic.

1641547,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B00C2PO14C,Moviedude,"[6, 6]","A dying millionaire sends his son and a team of climbers up a dangerous Bhutanese mountain to find the lost kingdom of Shambalah, where he believes his illness can be cured. Too bad that the mountain is infested with insectoid dragon-like creatures who eat anyone dumb enough to come skulking around. Matters are further complicated by a local military commander who takes his own interest in the mountain and it's legends to dangerous yet predictable extremes.These direct-to-video sci-fi films tend to follow a pretty predictable formula, so I'll break this review down into its constituent parts:Lone Token Celebrity:NOBODY. This movie is so cheap that there is literally nobody noteworthy in it.Lesson About Man's Hubris:Pretty solid. The monsters don't leave their mountain so going to them is basically the only way to get killed. Also the lost, highly advanced kingdom everyone is looking for is just a sad, monster-filled ruin that everyone looks at from a distance because exploring it would cost too much.Carnage:The monsters eat some people and even drag down a helicopter, but none of it is very exciting.Awful Effects:The monsters actually look pretty good- all black and withered from the cold, and covered in dangerous spikey bits. Like all syfy films however, this one insists on using CG for aircraft, gunfire, and just about everything else that costs money, resulting in a lot of effects that COULD have been believable practical effects looking super fake instead.Romantic Subplot:As is common in this film the hero and heroine are a divorced couple that doesn't really fight- this saves the screenwriters the effort of relationship building since the threat of monster mayhem is enough to push the starstruck lovers back together. In this case though they just go off as friends, so surprising realism I guess.Big Action Truck:In spite of the abundant rugged terrain on offer here, nobody has a big action truck.Pedantic, small looking, and totally by-the-numbers, Killer Mountain marries lazy writing to contrived storytelling to give us a big old slice of forgettable. Just watch the first half of Rodan for the same general idea but better.",2,Avoid Killer Mountain (the place AND the film),1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,2164,"['dying', 'millionaire', 'son', 'team', 'climbers', 'dangerous', 'Bhutanese', 'mountain', 'find', 'lost', 'kingdom', 'Shambalah', 'where', 'illness', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'Too', 'bad', 'mountain', 'infested', 'insectoid', 'dragon-like', 'creatures', 'who', 'eat', 'anyone', 'dumb', 'enough', 'come', 'skulking', 'around', 'Matters', 'are', 'further', 'complicated', 'local', 'military', 'commander', 'who', 'own', 'interest', 'mountain', 'legends', 'dangerous', 'yet', 'predictable', 'extremes.These', 'direct-to-video', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'tend', 'follow', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'formula', ""'ll"", 'break', 'review', 'down', 'constituent', 'parts', 'Lone', 'Token', 'Celebrity', 'NOBODY', 'movie', 'so', 'cheap', 'literally', 'nobody', 'noteworthy', 'it.Lesson', 'Man', 'Hubris', 'Pretty', 'solid', 'monsters', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'mountain', 'so', 'going', 'basically', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'killed', 'Also', 'lost', 'highly', 'advanced', 'kingdom', 'everyone', 'looking', 'just', 'sad', 'monster-filled', 'ruin', 'everyone', 'distance', 'exploring', 'would', 'cost', 'too', 'much.Carnage', 'monsters', 'eat', 'people', 'even', 'drag', 'down', 'helicopter', 'none', 'very', 'exciting.Awful', 'Effects', 'monsters', 'actually', 'look', 'pretty', 'good-', 'black', 'withered', 'cold', 'covered', 'dangerous', 'spikey', 'bits', 'syfy', 'films', 'however', 'one', 'using', 'CG', 'aircraft', 'gunfire', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'money', 'resulting', 'lot', 'effects', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'believable', 'practical', 'effects', 'looking', 'super', 'fake', 'instead.Romantic', 'Subplot', 'common', 'film', 'hero', 'heroine', 'are', 'divorced', 'couple', ""n't"", 'really', 'fight-', 'screenwriters', 'effort', 'relationship', 'building', 'threat', 'monster', 'mayhem', 'enough', 'push', 'starstruck', 'back', 'together', 'case', 'just', 'go', 'off', 'friends', 'surprising', 'realism', 'guess.Big', 'Action', 'Truck', 'spite', 'abundant', 'rugged', 'terrain', 'offer', 'here', 'nobody', 'big', 'action', 'truck.Pedantic', 'small', 'looking', 'totally', 'by-the-numbers', 'Killer', 'Mountain', 'marries', 'lazy', 'writing', 'contrived', 'storytelling', 'give', 'big', 'old', 'slice', 'forgettable', 'Just', 'watch', 'first', 'half', 'Rodan', 'same', 'general', 'idea', 'better']",Killer Mountain
1641548,A3S7REHVBOSTLR,B00C2PO14C,Toni V. Sweeney,"[0, 0]","The screenplay for this one is straight from the Creature Feature Cliche Notebook. Both the cast of characters and the plot could've been developed from an outline for a hundred other features. I was able to call out what was going to happen next as the film progressed and some of the things the characters did were so stupid they had to have been written in for no other reason than to follow that outline. Shangri-La was there (barely) and the creatures guarding it--lizard-like but at least not Yeti--could reptiles survive at such a high altitude?  The Druks--yes, that's what they were called--are never really seen except in vague silhouette showing teeth and a dragon-like spine, and some slug-like larval stage which is just as deadly as the adults.  Needless to say, the cast follows the usual progression in being picked off one by one in accepted ways most of which are caused by their own stupidity or stubbornness. Some unnecessary violence by a corrupt government official along the way  and the expected conflagration at the end. I vacillated between turning it off and toughing it out but since I had noting better to do, saw it through to the bitter end, and was even less enlightened for it.",3,A Filmful of Cliches,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,1210,"['screenplay', 'one', 'straight', 'Creature', 'Feature', 'Cliche', 'Notebook', 'cast', 'characters', 'plot', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'developed', 'outline', 'hundred', 'other', 'features', 'was', 'able', 'call', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'film', 'progressed', 'things', 'characters', 'did', 'were', 'so', 'stupid', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'other', 'reason', 'follow', 'outline', 'Shangri-La', 'was', 'barely', 'creatures', 'guarding', 'lizard-like', 'least', 'not', 'Yeti', 'could', 'reptiles', 'survive', 'high', 'altitude', 'Druks', 'yes', 'what', 'were', 'called', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'vague', 'silhouette', 'showing', 'teeth', 'dragon-like', 'spine', 'slug-like', 'larval', 'stage', 'just', 'as', 'deadly', 'adults', 'Needless', 'say', 'cast', 'usual', 'progression', 'being', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'accepted', 'ways', 'most', 'are', 'caused', 'own', 'stupidity', 'stubbornness', 'unnecessary', 'violence', 'corrupt', 'government', 'official', 'way', 'expected', 'conflagration', 'end', 'vacillated', 'turning', 'off', 'toughing', 'out', 'had', 'noting', 'better', 'do', 'saw', 'bitter', 'end', 'was', 'even', 'less', 'enlightened']",Killer Mountain
