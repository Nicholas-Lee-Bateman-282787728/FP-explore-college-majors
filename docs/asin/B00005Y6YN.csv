There is no wide screen, it has poor contrast and looks more like a well used video.  If this is the only copy available then fair enough - publish it this way, but you should be warned that the movie is nothing to look at, and I suspect that it does not do full justice to the original.  Having said this, it is an entertaining movie with plenty of plot twists.  Personally I found it more humorous than suspenseful.  Unusually, for a thriller there is not graphic violence until the last scene and likewise no nudity so it's quite tame by modern standards.  The psychological impact of the movie is kind of watered down by the fact that the lead character is equally as disturbed as most of the people stalking him and hence they all seem to deserve each other.  Overall this is a well-acted and quite humorous movie that builds up to a better second half.  Not sure it is worth buying a DVD of this picture quality though unless you really know that you want it.",3,Decent Movie Poor Copy,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,1048,"['quality', 'transfer', 'movie', 'DVD', 'passable', 'disappointing', 'wide', 'screen', 'poor', 'contrast', 'more', 'well', 'used', 'video', 'only', 'copy', 'available', 'then', 'fair', 'enough', 'publish', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'movie', 'nothing', 'look', 'suspect', 'not', 'do', 'full', 'justice', 'original', 'Having', 'said', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'plenty', 'plot', 'twists', 'Personally', 'found', 'more', 'humorous', 'suspenseful', 'Unusually', 'thriller', 'not', 'graphic', 'violence', 'last', 'scene', 'likewise', 'nudity', 'quite', 'tame', 'modern', 'standards', 'psychological', 'impact', 'movie', 'kind', 'watered', 'down', 'fact', 'lead', 'character', 'equally', 'as', 'disturbed', 'most', 'people', 'stalking', 'hence', 'seem', 'deserve', 'other', 'Overall', 'well-acted', 'quite', 'humorous', 'movie', 'up', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'Not', 'sure', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'really', 'know', 'want']",N/A
689155,A2LC0DE4ZFHPCD,B00005Y6YN,C.J.,"[1, 1]",This is a brilliantly done movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat from the credits to the end.  Chabrol has really captured the suspense of Patricia Highsmith's novel and added a lot of his own genius to the script.  The actors are perfect for the roles they play.  Chabol's psychological sense is right on.  It's one of his best films.,5,An Exciting Film,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,343,"['brilliantly', 'done', 'movie', 'edge', 'seat', 'credits', 'end', 'Chabrol', 'really', 'captured', 'suspense', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'novel', 'added', 'lot', 'own', 'genius', 'script', 'actors', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'play', 'Chabol', 'psychological', 'sense', 'right', 'one', 'best', 'films']",N/A
689156,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005Y6YN,Doug Anderson,"[9, 9]","Chabrol is the French master of suspense. His most succesful films are the ones in which he extends the bounds(though not too far) of the tried and true Hitchcockian formula. La Femme Infidele(68) and Le Boucher(69) as well as La Ceremonie(97) are considered masterpieces. He also has several films that are near masterpieces. But as a director who directs one film a year he also has made a lot of forgettable pictures as well. Cry of the Owl is not a masterpiece but it is one of Chabrols more memorable efforts. Few pictures have been more aptly and evocatively titled. The lead character is a moribund architect with a sadistic ex-wife who paints birds of prey. And in his spare time he  spies on a chosen prey of his own, a lovely and innocent looking young woman. But she too, once met, proves equally moribund.  The story is stark and each new character met presents yet another twist or turn, (or twisted turn). It is a long dark tunnel of a movie and there is little hope offered that there will be any coming out the other side. Some of Chabrols best work is dark but in his best films there are moments of comic relief as in the very funny outdoor love scenes in his under rated Wedding in Blood(73). Cry of the Owl is a darkly hued ode of a movie which is very good at what it does. The actors are not particularly exciting just competent and the locales are rather unextraordinary but it is a well executed and rare, very rare, kind of movie that presents its dark vision with no apologies or compromises for mere entertainments sake. Chabrol loyalists will be glad to have this and Highsmith readers will too but not many more will really want to go here.Perhaps the only major flaw is that with so many dark chords being struck one begins to become tone deaf by movies end. The dark tones would stand out more if there were something offered in contrast. There is nothing so much as a kiss in this movie. A voyeur movie that is not sensual nor erotic. Bold and haunting. Creepy and cold. Chabrol perhaps has strayed even further than usual from his Hitchcockian formula for success and trespassed into a not easily defined genre between psychological mystery and supernatural thriller. His best of the eighties, but then the eighties was not Chabrols best decade.",4,"Thanatos, nocturne in e, night symphony",1023753600,"06 11, 2002",2002,2278,"['Chabrol', 'French', 'master', 'suspense', 'most', 'succesful', 'films', 'are', 'ones', 'bounds', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'tried', 'true', 'Hitchcockian', 'formula', 'La', 'Femme', 'Infidele', '68', 'Le', 'Boucher', '69', 'as', 'well', 'La', 'Ceremonie', '97', 'are', 'considered', 'masterpieces', 'also', 'several', 'films', 'are', 'near', 'masterpieces', 'director', 'who', 'one', 'film', 'year', 'also', 'made', 'lot', 'forgettable', 'pictures', 'well', 'Cry', 'Owl', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'Chabrols', 'more', 'memorable', 'efforts', 'Few', 'pictures', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'aptly', 'evocatively', 'titled', 'lead', 'character', 'moribund', 'architect', 'sadistic', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'birds', 'prey', 'spare', 'time', 'chosen', 'prey', 'own', 'lovely', 'innocent', 'looking', 'young', 'woman', 'too', 'once', 'met', 'equally', 'moribund', 'story', 'stark', 'new', 'character', 'met', 'presents', 'yet', 'twist', 'turn', 'twisted', 'turn', 'long', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'movie', 'little', 'hope', 'offered', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'other', 'side', 'Chabrols', 'best', 'work', 'dark', 'best', 'films', 'are', 'moments', 'comic', 'relief', 'very', 'funny', 'outdoor', 'love', 'scenes', 'rated', 'Wedding', 'Blood', '73', 'Cry', 'Owl', 'darkly', 'hued', 'ode', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'just', 'competent', 'locales', 'are', 'rather', 'unextraordinary', 'well', 'executed', 'rare', 'very', 'rare', 'kind', 'movie', 'dark', 'vision', 'apologies', 'compromises', 'mere', 'entertainments', 'sake', 'Chabrol', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'have', 'Highsmith', 'readers', 'will', 'too', 'not', 'many', 'more', 'will', 'really', 'want', 'go', 'only', 'major', 'flaw', 'so', 'many', 'dark', 'chords', 'being', 'struck', 'one', 'become', 'tone', 'deaf', 'movies', 'end', 'dark', 'tones', 'would', 'stand', 'out', 'more', 'were', 'something', 'offered', 'contrast', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'kiss', 'movie', 'voyeur', 'movie', 'not', 'sensual', 'erotic', 'Bold', 'haunting', 'Creepy', 'cold', 'Chabrol', 'perhaps', 'strayed', 'even', 'further', 'usual', 'Hitchcockian', 'formula', 'success', 'trespassed', 'not', 'easily', 'defined', 'genre', 'psychological', 'mystery', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'best', 'eighties', 'then', 'eighties', 'was', 'not', 'Chabrols', 'best', 'decade']",N/A
689157,A2R60DUF9N2KKK,B00005Y6YN,Harry O,"[0, 0]","Top notch Chabrol--in fact, one of his best--via Patricia Highsmith (author of Strangers On A Train and the Ripley books). Like any really good mystery, a film that is difficult to summarize without giving away plot developments that the viewer should come upon himself as he watches the story develop. Suffice to say that the story revolves around the relationships among the four main characters: Robert, an emotionally unstable man; Juliette, the woman on whom he has been spying, who develops an attachment to him; Veronique, his ex-wife; and Solages, Juliette's ex-boyfriend. Chabrol creates incredible tension, as it is never clear what direction the film is going to take.

689158,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00005Y6YN,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[5, 5]","Patricia Highsmith is known for her intelligent thrillers--chief among them The Talented Mr. Ripley (filmed twice)--and this film is no exception.  Based on Highsmith's novel of the same name and directed by the inestimable Claude Chabrol, this becomes increasingly disturbing as it progresses until, at the end, we are chilled to the bone.The story of Robert Forestier, a man who initially seems to have the minor vice of peeping (minor because he does not practice this when his ""victim"" is nude, but clothed), it becomes darker as we find out that the object of his scrutiny, Juliette, is herself skewed, although in a dramatically different way.  And that Robert's ex-wife has her own unusual predilections.  As does Juliette's boyfriend Paul.Not only that, but there is something far more disturbing about Robert than his peeping, and that should not be revealed here.  Is he a murderer?  No.  Let's just say it does have something to do with death, however.  The intricate and intelligent interplay of the four main characters give this film an unusually powerful structure and tone.Made in 1987, it has rarely been equalled and is absolutely worth owning.  Without question, it's one of Chabrol's best films, matched in recent years only by his filming of another crime novel written by a British woman (Ruth Rendell), La Ceremonie.",5,Brilliant psychological thriller,1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,1339,"['Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'known', 'intelligent', 'thrillers', 'chief', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'filmed', 'twice', 'film', 'exception', 'Based', 'Highsmith', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'directed', 'inestimable', 'Claude', 'Chabrol', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'end', 'are', 'chilled', 'bone.The', 'story', 'Robert', 'Forestier', 'man', 'who', 'initially', 'have', 'minor', 'vice', 'peeping', 'minor', 'not', 'practice', 'when', 'victim', 'nude', 'clothed', 'darker', 'find', 'out', 'object', 'scrutiny', 'Juliette', 'skewed', 'dramatically', 'different', 'way', 'Robert', 'ex-wife', 'own', 'unusual', 'predilections', 'Juliette', 'boyfriend', 'Paul.Not', 'only', 'that', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'disturbing', 'Robert', 'peeping', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'revealed', 'here', 'murderer', 'No', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'death', 'however', 'intricate', 'intelligent', 'interplay', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'give', 'film', 'unusually', 'powerful', 'structure', 'tone.Made', '1987', 'rarely', 'been', 'equalled', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'owning', 'question', 'one', 'Chabrol', 'best', 'films', 'matched', 'recent', 'years', 'only', 'filming', 'crime', 'novel', 'written', 'British', 'woman', 'Ruth', 'Rendell', 'La', 'Ceremonie']",N/A

This jewel of deception and romance from France's master of suspense centers on the unexpected relationship between a peeping tom and the subject of his fantasy.  It's really unfair to say anything more about the plot except that while watching this giddy, unconventional movie you soon realize it's notgoing where you thought.

689160,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,B00005Y6YN,Utah Blaine,"[0, 6]","I am in general a big fan of Claude Chabrol films, and I think that it is safe to say that no other director has made films of such a range of quality as Chabrol.  Some of his best are masterpieces, but some of his worst are real duds.  I must admit that I cannot understand why most of the other reviews of this film are so positive.  Chabrol tried to create a psychological drama in this film, but the entire work comes off as dull and completely unbelievable.  There is no tension, the characters are simply stupid, and as I was watching this film I couldn't wait for it to be over.  The film starts off as a peep Tom (played by Christophe Malavoy) is caught staring into the window of a young woman.  The woman is engaged to be married, but she becomes enamoured with the peeping Tom and decides to call of the engagement.  Her fiance is angry and threatens Malavoy, eventually leading to fisticuffs.  After the fight, the fiance, in cohorts with Malavoy's ex-wife, decides to disappear and fake his death.  The young woman is enamored with Malavoy, but he spurns her, so she commits suicide.  This is only half way through the film!  The fiance and Malavoy's ex-wife contrive some scheme to `get even' with Malavoy that ends in violence and bloodshed, all the while an incompetent police commissioner is investigating everyone.In the end, this film is a total failure.  Chabrol tried to mix surprising plot twists and obsessed characters in an effort to create a tense psychological drama, but this effort was a complete failure.  The characters come off as stupid and unbelievable, the sudden plot twists seem haphazard, the story is just boring.  I give it two stars for the simple reason that it is a Chabrol film, and therefore worth watching (just once!) by anyone who generally likes his films.  This film is not even on the same planet as La Ceremonie.  Even for a hardcore Chabrol fan, I strongly recommend renting before buying.  You are not likely to be returning to this again and again.  This film is, in my opinion, grossly overrated by the positive Amazon reviews.",2,Pointless and boring,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,2083,"['am', 'general', 'big', 'fan', 'Claude', 'Chabrol', 'films', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'other', 'director', 'made', 'films', 'such', 'range', 'quality', 'Chabrol', 'best', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'worst', 'are', 'real', 'duds', 'must', 'admit', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'most', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'positive', 'Chabrol', 'tried', 'create', 'psychological', 'drama', 'film', 'entire', 'work', 'off', 'dull', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'tension', 'characters', 'are', 'simply', 'stupid', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'film', 'off', 'peep', 'Tom', 'played', 'Christophe', 'Malavoy', 'caught', 'staring', 'window', 'young', 'woman', 'woman', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'enamoured', 'peeping', 'Tom', 'call', 'engagement', 'fiance', 'angry', 'Malavoy', 'eventually', 'leading', 'fisticuffs', 'fight', 'fiance', 'cohorts', 'Malavoy', 'ex-wife', 'disappear', 'fake', 'death', 'young', 'woman', 'enamored', 'Malavoy', 'suicide', 'only', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'fiance', 'Malavoy', 'ex-wife', 'contrive', 'scheme', 'get', 'even', 'Malavoy', 'violence', 'bloodshed', 'incompetent', 'police', 'commissioner', 'investigating', 'end', 'film', 'total', 'failure', 'Chabrol', 'tried', 'mix', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'obsessed', 'characters', 'effort', 'create', 'tense', 'psychological', 'drama', 'effort', 'was', 'complete', 'failure', 'characters', 'come', 'off', 'stupid', 'unbelievable', 'sudden', 'plot', 'twists', 'seem', 'haphazard', 'story', 'just', 'boring', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'simple', 'reason', 'Chabrol', 'film', 'therefore', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'once', 'anyone', 'who', 'generally', 'films', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'planet', 'La', 'Ceremonie', 'Even', 'hardcore', 'Chabrol', 'fan', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'renting', 'buying', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'returning', 'again', 'again', 'film', 'opinion', 'grossly', 'overrated', 'positive', 'Amazon', 'reviews']",N/A
