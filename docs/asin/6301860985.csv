The original Amityville house, with the third floor triangular, chilling windows made the original Amityville movie a worldwide hit. Who could forget the windows and their chilling, eerie feeling they'd give you?? Amityville 4 seems to slip away from the psychological terror that was so prominent in the first three Amityville movies by giving quick, silly, and cheap scares. It was creepy, I'll admit, when the youngest girl in the family kept talking to the lamp, thinking that it was her father. But the scares in the movie aren't as drawn out and psychological as they were in the first movie. There is even some gore in the movie, which doesn't scare me, it just grosses me out. I just find evil hauntings such as wierd noises, strange sights(remember the demons that were coming out of the door in the cellar in the second Amityville movie?) and evil paranormal activity to be much more frightening. The movie actually DOES have the original Amityville house in the beginning of the movie, where a group of priests exorcise the house from the evil, which I felt was a mistake. I don't see what's wrong with continually using the same house if you're going to do a movie with &quot;Amityville&quot; in the title. The original house was perfect for a evil haunted house movie. The house wasn't TOO big, not too small, and it was old and creepy looking to begin with. Not to mention that it was nice enough of a house where all the creepy things that have gone on in the first three movies inside it added to the intrigue of the movie. But I gave it a try anyway, and although many people may disagree with me, I have to say, if you're going to make a movie with the word &quot;Amityville&quot;, you should stick with the original house that made the first movie a hit across the world. And you should also stick with the same types of psychological terror that was so prevalent in the first three movies. To make a long story short, it really wasn't scaring me. As far as the cast, one thing that was turning me off was that there were a couple of elderly women in the movie who reminded me of Alice from the Brady Bunch or extras for the Golden Girls, who both unfortunately have big roles. The youngest daughter was great at her part, as the one who gets drawn to the lamp repeatedly and the evil inside the lamp tries to control her. Patty Duke, who's not only very attractive in the movie plays her part very well as the mother of the little girl. You also won't mind(trust me, guys) looking at the older daughter. The young priest in the movie was very good too. Watching him exorcise the Amityville house in the beginning of the movie was REALLY COOL!! If you're an Amityville freak, it MIGHT be worth checking it out just to see the original house in the beginning, and a FEW scenes with the youngest daughter's obsession with the lamp. And guys, it definately won't hurt to see the mother and older daughter in the movie. Other than that, the movie should have stayed with the original Amityville house. I cannot believe there are absolutely NO MORE ideas moviemakers could come up with for the original house.",2,Why use a different house??,1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,3225,"['Well', 'looks', 'other', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'minority', 'one', 'original', 'Amityville', 'house', 'third', 'floor', 'triangular', 'chilling', 'windows', 'made', 'original', 'Amityville', 'movie', 'worldwide', 'hit', 'Who', 'could', 'forget', 'windows', 'chilling', 'eerie', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'give', 'Amityville', '4', 'slip', 'away', 'psychological', 'terror', 'was', 'so', 'prominent', 'first', 'three', 'Amityville', 'movies', 'giving', 'quick', 'silly', 'cheap', 'scares', 'was', 'creepy', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'when', 'youngest', 'girl', 'family', 'kept', 'talking', 'lamp', 'thinking', 'was', 'father', 'scares', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'drawn', 'psychological', 'were', 'first', 'movie', 'even', 'gore', 'movie', ""n't"", 'scare', 'just', 'grosses', 'just', 'find', 'evil', 'hauntings', 'such', 'wierd', 'noises', 'strange', 'sights', 'remember', 'demons', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'door', 'cellar', 'second', 'Amityville', 'movie', 'evil', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'movie', 'actually', 'DOES', 'have', 'original', 'Amityville', 'house', 'beginning', 'movie', 'where', 'group', 'priests', 'exorcise', 'house', 'evil', 'felt', 'was', 'mistake', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'wrong', 'continually', 'using', 'same', 'house', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'movie', 'quot', 'Amityville', 'quot', 'title', 'original', 'house', 'was', 'perfect', 'evil', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'house', 'was', ""n't"", 'TOO', 'big', 'not', 'too', 'small', 'was', 'old', 'creepy', 'looking', 'begin', 'Not', 'mention', 'was', 'nice', 'enough', 'house', 'where', 'creepy', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'added', 'intrigue', 'movie', 'gave', 'try', 'anyway', 'many', 'people', 'may', 'disagree', 'have', 'say', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'word', 'quot', 'Amityville', 'quot', 'should', 'stick', 'original', 'house', 'made', 'first', 'movie', 'hit', 'world', 'should', 'also', 'stick', 'same', 'types', 'psychological', 'terror', 'was', 'so', 'prevalent', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'scaring', 'As', 'far', 'cast', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'turning', 'off', 'was', 'were', 'couple', 'elderly', 'women', 'movie', 'who', 'reminded', 'Alice', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'extras', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'big', 'roles', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'was', 'great', 'part', 'one', 'who', 'drawn', 'lamp', 'repeatedly', 'evil', 'lamp', 'tries', 'control', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'attractive', 'movie', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'mother', 'little', 'girl', 'also', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'trust', 'guys', 'looking', 'older', 'daughter', 'young', 'priest', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'Watching', 'exorcise', 'Amityville', 'house', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'REALLY', 'COOL', ""'re"", 'Amityville', 'freak', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'just', 'see', 'original', 'house', 'beginning', 'FEW', 'scenes', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'obsession', 'lamp', 'guys', 'definately', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'see', 'mother', 'older', 'daughter', 'movie', 'Other', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'original', 'Amityville', 'house', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'are', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'MORE', 'ideas', 'moviemakers', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'original', 'house']",N/A

I was very surprised after I finished watching it because I expected it to be terrible, but it really took me by surprise and ended up being great!  You can tell that it doesn't try really hard to be a good movie, in fact it doesn't try at all, like most of the other AMITYVILLE sequels. It just ends up being very interesting and it's a very good possession film.

270907,A1QANPJ4NEESAJ,6301860985,Jerry Beaudin,"[4, 4]","A little bit scarier than the spoofy AMITYVILLE 3-D, this made- for-TV sequel is surprisingly scary and gory. The movie starts off in the Amityville house where a group of Priest's have just exorcised it from the demon spirits. But little do they realize the demon has taken the form of a lamp. Later in a yard sale, a woman buys the possessed lamp and gives it to her sister as a present and soon begins a new reign of terror as the possessed lamp takes over a new homestead. As I pointed out earlier, this is a made-for-TV sequel, but don't let that distract you from enjoying it. It has a lot of really scary moments with a dark atmosphere and there are some good gory moments for people who like lots of blood. The characters are really likebale and the movie generates some good moments of suspense. This is also more of a stand-alone movie. You don't have to be that familiar with the previous movies to know what's going on.
