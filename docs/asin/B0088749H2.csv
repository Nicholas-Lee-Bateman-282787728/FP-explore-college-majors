Essentially a coming a age film following the plight of 15 year old Ellis (Graham Phillips) trying to find his place in this world.  Raised by his hipster Mom, and Goat Man (David Duchovny), he reconnects with his remarried and absent father.  The reunion is difficult at first, but rebounds later in the film, rather rapidly.  The film has a fair number of characters including Ellis' roommate and prep school buddies, and a mix of neighbors and his Mom's boyfriend (Justin Kirk of Weeds).  It's a &#34;420&#34; friendly flick, and this combined with actor Kirk, the movie often reminded me of an episode of Weeds, only slower and not quite as insane (or good).  It's a nice film for a chill moment, to just sit back and watch, presuming you like coming of age films with a bunch of crazy characters.  My favorite line is when the local town girl asks Ellis if Atticus Finch exist in the real world?  It's a film highlight, in an otherwise average movie, thought well acted and directed.",3,"Coming of Age Film Complete with Goats, Prep Schools and Lots of Marijuana",1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,1051,"['Goats', 'quiet', 'charmer', 'dramatic', 'times', 'quirky', 'others', 'Essentially', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'following', 'plight', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Ellis', 'Graham', 'Phillips', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'Raised', 'hipster', 'Mom', 'Goat', 'Man', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'remarried', 'absent', 'father', 'reunion', 'difficult', 'first', 'later', 'film', 'rather', 'rapidly', 'film', 'fair', 'number', 'characters', 'including', 'Ellis', 'roommate', 'prep', 'school', 'buddies', 'mix', 'neighbors', 'Mom', 'boyfriend', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'Weeds', '34', '420', '34', 'friendly', 'flick', 'combined', 'actor', 'Kirk', 'movie', 'often', 'reminded', 'episode', 'Weeds', 'only', 'slower', 'not', 'quite', 'insane', 'good', 'nice', 'film', 'chill', 'moment', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'presuming', 'coming', 'age', 'films', 'bunch', 'crazy', 'characters', 'favorite', 'line', 'when', 'local', 'town', 'girl', 'Ellis', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'exist', 'real', 'world', 'film', 'highlight', 'otherwise', 'average', 'movie', 'thought', 'well', 'acted', 'directed']",Goats
1548360,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0088749H2,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","Goats is one of the better quirky independent films I've seen in a long time.This is a classic coming of age film with a twist. Ellis is a nice intelligent boy living in Tucson, Arizona with his hippie mother and her hippie friend Goat Man. His mother Wendy is self centered with more money than she knows what to do with, in fact so much money that she never writes a check but knows exactly how much money is left in her trust fund. Goat Man is simply a friend that cleans the pool, does some gardening, and lives in the pool house. Early in the film Ellis is shipped off to an East Coast prep school, the same one his father attended.The film really works because of the cast. David Duchovny is Goat Man, from the cover art; he is well covered up with the beard and long hair. Duchovny balanced exactly the right amount of stoner, intelligence, and caring. He is fond of Ellis and shows it in only the way he knows, goat treks. Wendy played by Vera Farmiga is absolutely perfect; all she cares about is herself but wants to be a mother. Ty Burrel (Modern Family) is surprising as Ellis's father, Frank (or as Wendy would say f'ing Frank her ex-husband). Keri Russel is simply gorgeous as Frank's new young and pregnant wife. Every line she delivers is caring and perfect toward Ellis. Justin Kirk (Weeds) is perfectly slimy as Wendy's latest play thing lover. The one small problem with the script, Ellis was supposed to be 15 in the film, Graham Philips (the son from Good Wife) is just way too old to remotely seem that age. If they had never mentioned his age, 17 or 18 would have worked perfectly. Otherwise, Philips was fantastic as Ellis. He completely lost that annoying idiot child making horrible mistakes from The Good Wife. I really liked him in this role. Not credited and not listed in IMDB is Minnie Driver making a cameo appearance as a scream coach at the end of the film.This is one heck of a good film. The film is rated R. There is a ton of pot use in the film; in fact Ellis smokes it quite a bit. There is some male nudity with genitals missing from view. There are two funny scenes with a testicle showing, and there is a scene in a Mexican strip club with topless women. There is a bit of strong language. On the violence front, there were a few fist fights, but no killing or gore. With those warnings in mind, it is entirely possible a mature younger viewer might be able to watch this film.Christopher Neil is the first time director of this film. He did an amazing job. I would look forward to seeing his films in the future.Goats is a surprising film that is just the right amount of quirky. It is what is right about good independent film.",5,Quirky,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2671,"['Goats', 'one', 'better', 'quirky', 'independent', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.This', 'classic', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'twist', 'Ellis', 'nice', 'intelligent', 'boy', 'living', 'Tucson', 'Arizona', 'hippie', 'mother', 'hippie', 'friend', 'Goat', 'Man', 'mother', 'Wendy', 'self', 'centered', 'more', 'money', 'what', 'do', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'never', 'check', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'left', 'trust', 'fund', 'Goat', 'Man', 'simply', 'friend', 'pool', 'gardening', 'pool', 'house', 'Early', 'film', 'Ellis', 'shipped', 'off', 'East', 'Coast', 'prep', 'school', 'same', 'one', 'father', 'attended.The', 'film', 'really', 'cast', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Goat', 'Man', 'cover', 'art', 'well', 'covered', 'up', 'beard', 'long', 'hair', 'Duchovny', 'balanced', 'exactly', 'right', 'amount', 'stoner', 'intelligence', 'caring', 'fond', 'Ellis', 'only', 'way', 'goat', 'treks', 'Wendy', 'played', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'about', 'be', 'mother', 'Ty', 'Burrel', 'Modern', 'Family', 'surprising', 'Ellis', 'father', 'Frank', 'Wendy', 'would', 'say', ""f'ing"", 'Frank', 'ex-husband', 'Keri', 'Russel', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'Frank', 'new', 'young', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'line', 'caring', 'perfect', 'Ellis', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'Weeds', 'perfectly', 'slimy', 'Wendy', 'latest', 'play', 'thing', 'lover', 'one', 'small', 'problem', 'script', 'Ellis', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', '15', 'film', 'Graham', 'Philips', 'son', 'Good', 'Wife', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'remotely', 'seem', 'age', 'had', 'never', 'mentioned', 'age', '17', '18', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'Otherwise', 'Philips', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Ellis', 'completely', 'lost', 'annoying', 'idiot', 'child', 'making', 'horrible', 'mistakes', 'Good', 'Wife', 'really', 'liked', 'role', 'Not', 'credited', 'not', 'listed', 'IMDB', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'making', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'scream', 'coach', 'end', 'film.This', 'one', 'heck', 'good', 'film', 'film', 'rated', 'R.', 'ton', 'pot', 'use', 'film', 'fact', 'Ellis', 'quite', 'bit', 'male', 'nudity', 'genitals', 'missing', 'view', 'are', 'two', 'funny', 'scenes', 'testicle', 'showing', 'scene', 'Mexican', 'strip', 'club', 'topless', 'women', 'bit', 'strong', 'language', 'violence', 'front', 'were', 'few', 'fist', 'fights', 'killing', 'gore', 'warnings', 'mind', 'entirely', 'possible', 'mature', 'younger', 'viewer', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'film.Christopher', 'Neil', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'film', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'would', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'films', 'future.Goats', 'surprising', 'film', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'quirky', 'what', 'right', 'about', 'good', 'independent', 'film']",Goats

Ellis has spent much of his early formative years taking treks and toking down with Goat Man, aka Javier, (David Duchovny) with whom he smokes copious amounts of grass and generally hangs out.Ellis heads to an equally gorgeous New England prep school his own absent straitlaced rich father Frank (Ty Burrell) once attended. In fact, his dad had roomed there with the current headmaster, and so the bar is set high for Ellis. He smokes his courses (cut off from his cannabis connection), meets up with other potheads at the school, runs cross-country after some coercion from the hip track coach, declines a liaison with local dining-hall staffer Minnie (Dakota Johnson), who spends her time reading and making extra money off the student bodies. Ellis initially runs afoul of his father Frank during a terse, tense Thanksgiving, but later the pair find their peace and bond.Ellis has to decide where to spend summer break, back in Arizona or with his dad, his step mother, and infant half brother.Well, the critics pretty much gleefully savaged this Sundance film, citing its meandering plot, lack of action, and hybridized comedy-drama tone and comparing the actors and the plot to goats. Cynics are always ready with barbs, but I have to say, this is a fun movie when you don't want 3D special effects, overbearing soundtracks, mutilation and mayhem, and twisted plot lines. In other words, ""Goats"" affords one the chance to just kick back, watch a story without any secret message or theme. It's just a twisted tale, not a study in realism, about choices, growing up, and growing out. We have all done it in one way or another, and the point here is that there is always a story, even if  it is not a cautionary tale or sex romp.It is not a classic movie, but it is a classic case of what happens when critics drip spleen and venom without considering maybe the point of the movie is to meander.

1548372,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0088749H2,"Promise ""promise""","[3, 4]","There is one thing I really disliked about this film and I'll say that and get it off my chest and move on to the good stuff.  I hated the really ignorant way that ""New Age"" people were depicted.  True, there are fools in any group but to characterize the many serious people who are attempting to find a higher spiritual way of life in the way this film does is offensive.  I turned the film off after about 45 minutes just because of this.However I did turn it back on the next night and found that it managed to rise above the stereotypes it created in the beginning.  Not only were the New Agers ripped apart but the East Coast ""strait"" guy who went to Prep School was intially dismissed as an uptight jerk. The only sympathetic character was ""Goat Man"" the resident hippie, who somehow escaped being lumped in with the New Agers and, due to his massive consumption of home grown pot, was Mister Mellow.  Having spent considerable time in that area of the world with spiritual seekers and pot growers I think that there are some serious misconceptions about all of them.However, moving on....I did like the lead character, Ellis Whitman, played by a wonderful young actor, Graham Phillips, enough to tune back in to see what happened to him after he left Arizona and went back east to attend the same Prep School that his hated dad had attended.  This is not very well explained since it's obvious that Ellis isn't at all fond of the man who apparently deserted him early on.  He has grown up with his mother, Wendy, (played beautifully by the wonderfully charming Vera Farmiga,)a ditzy, childish, self-centered but very rich woman and her landscaper/pool cleaner guy, Javier, aka Goat Man.  Goat Man is the surrogate father figure and has given Ellis a great deal of love as well as  dope.The contrast between the two cultures gives a certain amount of humour and provides the grist for the mill of Ellis' maturation.  The film does a good job of showing how the fellow navigates between the worlds of both parents and that of Goat Man.  Ellis is surprisingly wise and resilient as he faces one challenge after another.  He learns, as we all have to, that no one is all good or all bad.  His flakey mom, in spite of her faults really does love him.  His straightlaced dad comes through, too.  And the hallowed Goat Man is shown to have his own shortcomings. This is done very well without being too obvious or preachy.The cinematography is great.  The area outside of Tuscon shimmers in that magical desert light.  I loved the shots of Wendy's home....a hippie's dream!  Likewise the Prep School is lovingly shot...beautiful Spring trees in blossom and green lawns.  The staff at the school is first seen as annoying but they come around, too, and help Ellis find himself.  The pot that Goat Man has tried to send to Ellis never comes through and he is forced to go out for track and finds that he is a pretty good runner.  There is an interesting subplot  -- an almost-romance with a pretty, blond, town girl.  I thought the film handled it very nicely.

1548377,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B0088749H2,Sheryl Fechter,"[7, 8]","This is quite a different atmosphere for a coming of age story through and around ... Goats?  Yes. Christopher Neil directs this film with charming style and abundant laughs.  I was trepidatious about renting this one.  While this may not be to everybody's liking, it works all the way around for me.This movie is really about 15 year old Ellis (Graham Phillips) who is surrounded by a most colorful family.  He is ready to go his own way from Tucson to Gates Prep School on the East Coast; the same school his father, Frank (Ty Burrell), went to before him and the area where he has been living now.His mother, whom he calls Wendy by name, (Vera Farmiga, who shines in this) is a mix of the spiritual and New Age philosophies floating around in her own self-absorbed reality. If you can rope in Wendy's personality in a couple of sentences you are far better spoken than I.Goat Man (David Duchovny) or Javier, take your pick, is a 'botanist' and an experienced goat-trekker, who is hired by Wendy to keep up the place along with her.  Residing in the pool house, he tends to his ever growing garden and ... goats.  These two have raised Ellis in an offbeat style, along with a huge amount love.  Once you do get to know them they quickly become very genuine.Quite simply, Ellis leaves for school and is greeted with an alternate way of life that he easily learns to excel in.  While there, he meets up with his father for the first time in years of absence; he has been avoiding his ex-wife Wendy.Frank is re-married to Judy (Keri Russell) now, with a baby brother on the way. Their lifestyle is easily recognizable as affluent.  While Ellis' father may first appear emotionally vacant, Judy (being much younger) is right on target with Ellis and readily able to befriend him to bridge the gap between father and son.Wendy stays behind with Goat Man and takes up with a new jealous lover Bennett (Justin Kirk - perfect in this).  He screens every call and doesn't give Ellis' messages to Wendy, he wouldn't being the convincingly arrogant prig that he is.  They lose touch, because of his interference, and Wendy loses control going more into her spiritual side, well, her altogether self (?)In this film, watch a Thanksgiving dinner (ala Wendy) take on new meaning with Goat Man, Bennett and several others present.  Ellis chooses to go to Frank's home.  ... Wendy didn't get that phone call either ...*Also a nice cameo appearance with Minnie Driver if you catch it.This indie film plays out as one set-up after another onto some depth and hilarity, in a much more subtle way than hysterical.  Like the other reviewers, I agree with the 'sit back and enjoy' theme of Ellis' journey to find himself.  This movie is one that you wouldn't need to overthink, analyze or anything ... but laugh.As far as Goat Man ...

He is soon finding his feet and friends at school but whilst missing Goatman he is also re- evaluating himself and those around him. This then is a coming of age comedy drama.The term comedy has to be seen in the widest sense as it is more amusing in the making you smile department as opposed to laugh out loud funny. The acting is all quite good. Vera Farmiga (&#8216;Source Code and &#8216;The Departed&#8217;) is surprisingly convincing as the hippy mom and brings a lot of energy to the role.
