1035943,A2M4R8R6SU049A,B000KX0HFK,"Amazon Customer ""too many books, too little time""","[0, 1]","This is a beautiful little piece of noir that makes me think of some of the really great 1940s films.  We have a beautiful unappreciated woman, a dark controlling family member, an insurance investigator....  sound familiar?But tho the plot may resonate, this is a very original and beautifully done little film.  Of course, with such incredible acting talent, what would one expect?After a brief scene that introduces the insurance men to us, the film gives us a scene filled with a brutal murder and set up for an insurance scam.  As the insurance investigator comes to town to see if the one million dollar payout is justified, we meet people that may or may not be who they say they are.  And how perfectly this plays out for us.We especially enjoyed the little tribute to traditional noir films.  You know how sometimes we find the hero in a club with a beautiful chanteuse who may or may not be involved?  In this film, the club and the club employee are a bit more realistic.  We enjoyed the reference.I recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who enjoys good acting, thriller plotting, and an unexpected ending.",5,If you like noir,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,1130,"['beautiful', 'little', 'piece', 'noir', 'think', 'really', 'great', '1940s', 'films', 'have', 'beautiful', 'unappreciated', 'woman', 'dark', 'controlling', 'family', 'member', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'sound', 'familiar', 'plot', 'may', 'resonate', 'very', 'original', 'beautifully', 'done', 'little', 'film', 'course', 'such', 'incredible', 'acting', 'talent', 'what', 'would', 'one', 'expect', 'brief', 'scene', 'insurance', 'men', 'film', 'scene', 'filled', 'brutal', 'murder', 'set', 'up', 'insurance', 'scam', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'town', 'see', 'one', 'million', 'dollar', 'payout', 'justified', 'meet', 'people', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'who', 'say', 'are', 'how', 'perfectly', 'out', 'us.We', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'tribute', 'traditional', 'noir', 'films', 'know', 'how', 'sometimes', 'find', 'hero', 'club', 'beautiful', 'chanteuse', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'involved', 'film', 'club', 'club', 'employee', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'realistic', 'enjoyed', 'reference.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'reservation', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'acting', 'thriller', 'plotting', 'unexpected', 'ending']",A Little Trip to Heaven
1035944,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000KX0HFK,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The most disappointing part with A Little Trip to Heaven is *easily* that it never improves past the car accident in the beginning of the movie.  When a mans car breaks down during a rainstorm, he's forced to pull to the side and get a ride from a stranger.  As soon as he gets inside the car, the driver apparently had a death wish and drove the car directly into the side of a bridge.  A *very* good segment that was!!  After that, you're probably expecting more excitement in the same style, but much to my surprise (and dismay) instead you get a VERY mediocre mystery drama.Forest Whitaker plays the role of an investigator assigned to figure out the mysterious clues pertaining to this accident, however instead what happens is that Forest's character visits a family who has ties to the accident, and... the storyline settles into this groove of a slow-moving family and their fairly ordinary life and normal everyday problems.  Being an investigator, Forest sure didn't seem to be in any hurry to get the facts!I love Forest's accent.  I suppose he was trying to imitate an Icelandic accent, but it ended up sounding more like a nerd who's late for geology class.This movie is downright *boring*.  I don't know what else to say about it.  Eventually -without spoiling what exactly happens- we realize there's a scam taking place involving insurance, and the family (consisting of a man, woman and child) aren't what they appear to be.  Again, I can't spoil who they are and how they relate to the car accident in the beginning- all I can say is that it takes an eternity for the storyline to finally get to that point.  Seriously, you have to wait until at LEAST 70% of the way through to find out what's going on.Overall, I refuse to recommend anyone see such a disappointing detective movie.",2,poor,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,1800,"['most', 'disappointing', 'part', 'A', 'Little', 'Trip', 'Heaven', '*easily*', 'never', 'car', 'accident', 'beginning', 'movie', 'When', 'mans', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'rainstorm', 'forced', 'pull', 'side', 'get', 'ride', 'stranger', 'As', 'soon', 'car', 'driver', 'apparently', 'had', 'death', 'wish', 'drove', 'car', 'directly', 'side', 'bridge', '*very*', 'good', 'segment', 'was', ""'re"", 'probably', 'expecting', 'more', 'excitement', 'same', 'style', 'much', 'surprise', 'dismay', 'instead', 'get', 'VERY', 'mediocre', 'mystery', 'drama.Forest', 'Whitaker', 'role', 'investigator', 'assigned', 'figure', 'out', 'mysterious', 'clues', 'pertaining', 'accident', 'however', 'instead', 'what', 'Forest', 'character', 'family', 'who', 'ties', 'accident', 'storyline', 'groove', 'slow-moving', 'family', 'fairly', 'ordinary', 'life', 'normal', 'everyday', 'problems', 'Being', 'investigator', 'Forest', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'hurry', 'get', 'facts', 'love', 'Forest', 'accent', 'suppose', 'was', 'trying', 'imitate', 'Icelandic', 'accent', 'ended', 'up', 'sounding', 'more', 'nerd', 'who', 'late', 'geology', 'class.This', 'movie', 'downright', '*boring*', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', 'Eventually', 'spoiling', 'what', 'exactly', 'happens-', 'realize', 'scam', 'taking', 'place', 'involving', 'insurance', 'family', 'consisting', 'man', 'woman', 'child', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'Again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'relate', 'car', 'accident', 'beginning-', 'can', 'say', 'eternity', 'storyline', 'finally', 'get', 'point', 'Seriously', 'have', 'wait', 'LEAST', '70', '%', 'way', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'on.Overall', 'refuse', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'see', 'such', 'disappointing', 'detective', 'movie']",A Little Trip to Heaven

1035950,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000KX0HFK,Grady Harp,"[4, 7]","A LITTLE TRIP TO HEAVEN  is a strange little Indie film by Icelandic director Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur, a young director with some very fine ideas but with a script (written both by the director and Edward Martin Weinman) 'that is so spongy that the impact of the film relies on the considerable qualities of the cinematic images.  Filmed primarily in Iceland with some scenes in Hastings, Minnesota, the mood is dank and dark and cold - and so is the story.We first meet insurance investigator ('adjustor') Abe Holt as he listens to his boss Frank (Peter Coyote) explain to a new widow why she will not receive full death benefits because the insurance company took photos of her husband smoking, the apparent cause of his death. Abe just sits in the background but we know he is in tune with the fraudulent activity of the insurance company.  Almost immediately he is assigned to a new case: an ex-con with a million dollar life insurance policy has apparently been found dead in a car crash burned beyond recognition.  Abe drives to the tiny snowy desolate village where his questions of the townsfolk reveal that the victim was Kelvin Anderson, the brother of Isold (Julia Stiles) who is married to a low life type named Fred (Jeremy Renner), a man who we have seen in flashbacks as the one responsible for arranging the car crash and setting the car on fire. Abe sneaks around the town, spies on Isold, and becomes involved in the investigation in more ways than the honest one.  It is the interplay of the three - Abe, Fred, and Isold - that provide the intrigue and mystery of the apparent framed insurance scam.The screenplay is so full of holes that it is difficult to follow the case's development.  The actors are superb artists: Forest Whitaker made this film almost simultaneously with his Oscar winning 'The Last King of Scotland' yet here his character is plagued by an affected accent and by the lack of substance that might make us care about his plight; Julia Stiles does her best with the little she is given to do and Jeremy Renner is convincingly menacing without any factors that make us find him worth caring about. The supporting actors (Joanna Scanlan as a sleazy bartender, Iddo Goldberg and Philip Jackson as the police, Alfred Harmsworth as the 'son' of Isold, and Vladas Bagdonas as the coroner) actually fare better than the leads as far as material available.The strong aspect of the film is the visual imagery, due to the decisions of picture composition by Korm&aacute;kur and cinematographer &Oacute;ttar Gunason and  Mugison's musical is apropos for the mood.  But the film remains grounded and a bit on the confusing side because of  the director's lack of unity. One wonders why Whitaker, Stiles, and Renner signed on to this little film.

1035952,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000KX0HFK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","""A Little Trip To Heaven"" has actually been on my ""to see"" list for a couple of years now.  I love noir and this film seemed like something that would be right up my alley.  With Forest Whitaker, Julia Stiles, Peter Coyote and the indispensable Jeremy Renner, I expected a heavenly tale of deception and intrigue.  But while many of the plot elements were in place to provide an intriguing story, there is an awkwardness to ""A Little Trip To Heaven"" that derails some of the film's better elements.  The initial scenes in which a fatal car accident is staged are crisp and alive--but soon the tension gives way to artifice and unbelievability.  I firmly feel that a solidly plotted thriller is somewhere to be found, but it just isn't realized in the final screenplay or in the completed film.Forest Whitaker plays an insurance investigator sent to evaluate a death claim from the previously mentioned accident.  It's out to the country where the lawmen, naturally, are rubes.  As any insurance agent is want to do--Whitaker decides to spend an extended amount of time in town, interview and insinuate himself into the lives of all those involved, and solve a little murder or two by traipsing around the desolate landscape as some sort of unquestioned authority.  Heck, this is rural America--these country folk don't know any better!  Renner, at least, provides appropriate menace as a prime suspect of wrongdoing.  But the film steers into seriously unnecessary territory as some sort of romantic bond inexplicably forms between Whitaker and Stiles (who is as unlikable and as culpable as anyone in the film, but the filmmakers want us to view as a sympathetic heroine).  It's all very awkward.Part of the underlying awkwardness of ""A Little Trip To Heaven"" is that it is clearly set on foreign soil (Iceland to be exact) subbing for rural America.  This, in and of itself, might not be a problem--but when you're also loaded up with international actors doing over-the-top American accents, the language in this screenplay tends to become stilted.  With stellar talent like Phylidda Law and Anne Reid unconvincing in even bit roles (these great ladies play a school marm and a diner waitress in throw-away scenes), you know you've got a problem.  Add Whitaker, doing an accent from who knows where, and the film starts to get pretty messy.  Some have indicated that the film is difficult to follow--not so.  It's bigger mysteries just tend to push the boundaries of logic and believability.  I so wanted this to be a neo-noir treat--but it's a mystifying misfire.  Renner is worth that second star, though.

I wanted to take photos of most of the scenes - the barren fields, delapidated buildings and gray sky. Wow. I'm guessing it was supposed to take place in Minnesota or North Dakota.I was kinda confused about the identities of Frederick vs. Kelvin, but overall it was a compelling story. Julia Stiles has really matured since I first saw her in 10 Things I Hate About You (she was excellent in that too though, but in a different way). I still wonder about the blood running down her leg in one of her first scenes. Was that also done by Fred?Whitaker was fantastic as well, his character being quite likable. Shy, awkward, principled..trying to do the right thing for his company (to a point, of course) and his clients. Also liked his description of what it's like to burn to death - your eyeballs cracking like glass, your body fat bubbling out, etc. I could empathize with his character when his boss, played by Peter Coyote, makes him go on the road trips because he doesn't have a wife and kids.

It had an interesting plot, although sometimes it seemed hard to follow.  I did think that Forrest Whitaker and Julia Stiles did good work in this film, but for some reason the plot never really got off the ground and the final resolution just defied belief and not just because of where Whitaker's character ended up.  The wrap up was definately NOT in line with the psychological make up of the husband.  He would not have done that. No how.  No way.  It wasn't in him.  And Abe (Whitaker) - Maybe think of something unusual like, oh I don't know, how about calling the police when it involves a police matter.  Despite the flaws though, I thought it was pretty well acted and a pretty interesting piece of work.  This was not one of the best films I have ever seen, but if you like kind of off-beat, atmospheric movies this might be to your taste.

And Julia Stiles at the top of her considerable acting game. This movie will keep you engrossed from its surprising start to stunning finish.Peter Coyote's brief but memorable performance reminds you of the Konstantin Stanislavsky (the inventor of the famous Stanislavsky Method) quote, ""There are no small parts, only small actors.""I finally decide to get my own copy so I wouldn't be at the mercy of a cable movie schedule with no appreciation of what a fascinating little gem movie is.Jeremy Renner finally got his Oscar for ""the Hurt Locker.""
