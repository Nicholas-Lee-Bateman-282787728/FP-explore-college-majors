Though she certainly was evil, it seemed to me that she was acting. I wasn't really drawn into the character. Perry King's character was too naive, as was Shawnee Smith's. I was glad when the film ended.

966545,A3TPRIFSQVXY5H,B000E1YW1I,"William Neely ""Will""","[19, 20]","""Face of Evil"" is one of my favorite made-for-TV movies ever! I Am so glad that is has finally been released on DVD. It is basically about a young woman who kills a college student and takes her identity. The cast is great, most notably Tracey Gold, playing very much against type, and Shawnee Smith. I am a fan of both of them, and they did not disappoint here. Mary Lambert is also a fine director, and I think she helped bring this film a notch above the rest. If you are a fan of Tracey, Shawnee, Lambert, or just good, fun thrillers, ""Face of Evil"" is the perfect film for you!The DVD is in Full Frame format, but the transfer is pretty good.

966546,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000E1YW1I,Z Hayes,"[10, 10]","""Face of Evil"" is an engaging thriller that showcases the talent of Tracey Gold, who portrays a seriously disturbed amoral young woman who will do anything to get what she wants, at the expense of others' lives. Gold plays Darcy Palmer, a young woman engaged to be married to a reformed drunk [whom she has been dating for six months]. On the eve of her wedding, Darcy flees, taking with her her precious art pieces, and a very expensive diamond ring. At the airport, Darcy realises she doesn't have enough money to get to NY and targets a young woman, killing her in a ruthless manner just so she can get some money and assumes the girl's identity, taking the girl's student position at a prestigious private college. Darcy also meets Jeanelle Polk [Shawnee Smith] her rather shy roommate who is also very wealthy. Soon enough, Darcy targets Jeanelle's wealthy dad, Russell [Perry King] who finds himself slowly attracted to Darcy and promptly seduces him.The movie may not tread any new waters here but the strong performances by the cast elevate it above an average thriller. Gold is utterly credible as the mercenary and ruthless psychopath. King and Smith deliver credible performances as well. The pacing of the plot is well-done, engaging the viewer's attention and keeping one on tenterhooks throughout the movie. I'd recommend this to those who like suspenseful thrillers.",4,Tracey Gold shines as a psychopath in this thriller,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,1381,"['Face', 'Evil', 'engaging', 'thriller', 'talent', 'Tracey', 'Gold', 'who', 'seriously', 'disturbed', 'amoral', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'what', 'expense', 'others', 'lives', 'Gold', 'Darcy', 'Palmer', 'young', 'woman', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'reformed', 'drunk', '[', 'whom', 'been', 'dating', 'six', 'months', ']', 'eve', 'wedding', 'Darcy', 'taking', 'precious', 'art', 'pieces', 'very', 'expensive', 'diamond', 'ring', 'airport', 'Darcy', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'get', 'NY', 'young', 'woman', 'killing', 'ruthless', 'manner', 'just', 'can', 'get', 'money', 'girl', 'identity', 'taking', 'girl', 'student', 'position', 'prestigious', 'private', 'college', 'Darcy', 'also', 'Jeanelle', 'Polk', '[', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', ']', 'rather', 'shy', 'roommate', 'who', 'also', 'very', 'wealthy', 'Soon', 'enough', 'Darcy', 'Jeanelle', 'wealthy', 'dad', 'Russell', '[', 'Perry', 'King', ']', 'who', 'slowly', 'attracted', 'Darcy', 'promptly', 'him.The', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'tread', 'new', 'waters', 'here', 'strong', 'performances', 'cast', 'elevate', 'average', 'thriller', 'Gold', 'utterly', 'credible', 'mercenary', 'ruthless', 'psychopath', 'King', 'Smith', 'deliver', 'credible', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'pacing', 'plot', 'well-done', 'engaging', 'viewer', 'attention', 'keeping', 'one', 'tenterhooks', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'who', 'like', 'suspenseful', 'thrillers']",Face of Evil
