Of course you need a quiet hour and no disturbance to catch the magic and the deeper truth of it. Just as one cannot read any book at any time, it is the same with films. You have to be in the right mood for such a film. Have you cought the right moment - it makes you think about your own life and family matters. Great camera work and generally marvellous acting and a really, really great Angela Lansbury!",5,"I agree,",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,545,"['film', 'definitely', 'little', 'gem', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'illustration', 'have', 'book', 'literature', 'course', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'course', 'need', 'quiet', 'hour', 'disturbance', 'catch', 'magic', 'deeper', 'truth', 'Just', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'time', 'same', 'films', 'have', 'be', 'right', 'mood', 'film', 'Have', 'cought', 'right', 'moment', 'think', 'own', 'life', 'family', 'matters', 'Great', 'camera', 'work', 'generally', 'marvellous', 'acting', 'really', 'really', 'great', 'Angela', 'Lansbury']",The Blackwater Lightship
