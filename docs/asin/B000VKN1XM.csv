E Jackson,"[5, 7]","Interestingly enough I just happened to watch this movie right after playing the Black Sabbath song ""Children of the Grave""!Well, I wasn't really impressed with the supposed ghost evidence they were showing in the film.  I guess it was real actual evidence, but the atmosphere of the entire film failed to really make me frightened of the things they were showing on screen.It DID show, maybe by total accident, how unfortunate it was for children in orphanages to be treated as horribly as they were.  You will hear stories of some of the children who grew up in the orphanages and were treated like crap.  This was the thing that mostly kept me interested in the film.Unfortunately they bounce around a lot, from all over the country, talking about different stories and ghost hauntings.  Fascinating how most spirits are of children, or that children are attracted to spirits.  There's a strong connection between children and ghosts, and the film does do a decent job showing you that.Overall, it's your choice whether you want to check out this or not.",3,ghostly stuff,1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,1057,"['Interestingly', 'enough', 'just', 'happened', 'watch', 'movie', 'right', 'playing', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'song', 'Children', 'Grave', 'Well', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'impressed', 'supposed', 'ghost', 'evidence', 'were', 'showing', 'film', 'guess', 'was', 'real', 'actual', 'evidence', 'atmosphere', 'entire', 'film', 'failed', 'really', 'make', 'frightened', 'things', 'were', 'showing', 'screen.It', 'DID', 'show', 'maybe', 'total', 'accident', 'how', 'unfortunate', 'was', 'children', 'orphanages', 'be', 'treated', 'as', 'horribly', 'were', 'will', 'hear', 'stories', 'children', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'orphanages', 'were', 'treated', 'crap', 'was', 'thing', 'mostly', 'kept', 'interested', 'film.Unfortunately', 'bounce', 'lot', 'country', 'talking', 'different', 'stories', 'ghost', 'hauntings', 'Fascinating', 'how', 'most', 'spirits', 'are', 'children', 'children', 'are', 'attracted', 'spirits', 'strong', 'connection', 'children', 'ghosts', 'film', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'showing', 'that.Overall', 'choice', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'not']",Children of the Grave

I think I have more of a problem the way it was filmed more than anything.  I think they could have just filmed it like a straight documentary instead of the Booth brothers trying to show what cool editors they were and putting in rock music and child actors that were for effect only.  And I really could not take those two guys with the berets seriously at all.  I mean, what was that all about?  It was laughable.  The actual video, audio, and photo evidence that they had really was only about 20 minutes' worth.  The rest was filler.  In a nutshell, I was not impressed.  The photo evidence and EVP's were cool, the sequence in the tunnel in the basement was awesome, but there just wasn't enough of this type of footage.

1102874,A1AMPGEFN9R9CT,B000VKN1XM,grayjessical75,"[4, 4]","I'll say one thing about this movie--I totally understood why ghost hunters are not respected by skeptics.  I am someone that believes in the possibility of ghosts, though I admit that if they exist, it is probably a rare phenomenon and not as interesting as we make it out to believe.  For the most part, probably most &#34;ghosts&#34; have other explanations.  However, I try to keep an open mind--and I've never been disgusted by ghost hunters in the past...not even those guys on that &#34;Ghost Adventures&#34; show.The Booth brothers, though, totally ticked me off.  I only paid $1.99 to watch this, but I regretted spending even that much.  For one thing, they went all over the place.  They gave minute information about many things, but they never went into an in-depth history about the places they visited.While it isn't uncommon for ghost hunters to sometimes exaggerate a little bit, this show was totally into sensationalizing.  Some of the things they said didn't seem to even have proof to substantiate it.  For instance, at one orphanage, there was a hostile ghost that didn't like people intruding into his space.  Now personally, I can understand it if ghosts wouldn't like people coming into an area they consider their territory.  However, these men seemed to assume that the ghost of the former janitor was a pedophile who killed the kids, even though it didn't seem that there were any documents to support this.The one thing they focused on was how orphans tended to be mistreated.  It succeeded more in a social commentary of days of old than it did as a documentary on ghosts.It did have a few scares with that creepy blonde ghost they kept showing.  It had a very abrupt ending where they talked about how some children are evil, and then they made a quick reference to Mary Roff.

1102878,A15GWVEH2L5N2B,B000VKN1XM,Jeffrey A. Hopson,"[34, 39]","I watched this film last night and let me start by saying this: I think it's very likely that there are ghosts, hauntings, etc., but I am a very ""skeptical believer"". Back in the late 1800's, during the big ""Spiritist"" movement, tables were being rocked and floated, seances produced phantom images and voices ""from beyond"", ectoplasm squiggled into the air from the noses and mouths of ""mediums"", and about all of it was exposed as fraudulent. These days people are, again, pretty enthusiastic about ghosts and hauntings and speaking with their departed loved ones through some show-biz personality who reels them in like brook trout. The big difference between the old fashioned hoaxters of 130 yrs ago and the new breed of ""Ghost Hunters"" is that the toys and technology are phenomenal in these times. We can do literally anything we want with film and imaging now in the digital age and one would be hard pressed to discern the ""real from the reel"".I saw an error in one of the pictures shown - supposedly a police photograph - depicting a room in a delapidated building in which Satanic rituals had supposedly taken place. There is a Sigil of Baphomet (the pentagram with the goat face and a double circle around it with Hebrew characters in the circumference) and it is a perfectly detailed representation which was certainly not hand painted onto the wall and it was doctored to look ""bloody"". It was very OBVIOUSLY superimposed on the photo to look as though someone had painted it on the wall. These kinds of cheap tricks cast doubt on everything they did and, sadly, cast doubt on everything everybody else does as well. The ""Baby gets thrown out with the bath water"" for most people, just like the Spiritist Movement back in the late 1800's.After having a night to sleep on it, I don't believe the photos OR the EVGs were authentic. I think at BEST they were digitally altered to appear and sound like much more than what they actually were. These guys obviously read the reviews of people who watched the ""Spooked"" dvd and used the critiques offered by them to tweak this one, giving them more of what they wanted. I understand they are not welcome at Waverly Sanitarium any longer for misrepresentation of the historical account. There are scores of competent, serious paranormal investigators out there who wouldn't dream of compromising the integrity of their work, who use the same advanced equipment as the Booths and NO ONE ever gets the kind of evidence concocted for this film. That spooky pic of the shadow children on the hilltop looking down at them was cool, but just a bit over the top for my belief structure.I enjoyed the film for the atmosphere, the historical significance of the orphanages and the lost children in them, the shots of the buildings and graveyards, and such, but - do I believe that everything they presented to be authentic documentation and untampered with? Hell no. I see the Booth brothers as show biz people. They are a couple guys who are in the privileged position of having the wherewithal by which to indulge in their hobbies to a fantastic degree. As entertaining as it is, I have a fair share of disdain for people who bastardize the efforts of others who are working hard to prove and validate the belief in ghosts, spirits, and hauntings. Guys like the Booths and their ilk (i.e. about anything on television) muddy the water for those honestly seeking the truth in these matters.Watch it...eat popcorn and light candles - it's fun and great  entertainment.

I knew this was going to be a real gem when, during the transcription of a voice recording, we see the phrase ""...she through it into the fire"" pop up on the screen. Really? Everyone involved with your production was so illiterate that not a single person knew how to spell ""threw""? We're less than ten minutes into your movie and you've already made yourself a laughingstock. I should have gone with my original instinct and simply given it zero stars based on the first half, since I was certain there was nothing they could do to pick up even half a star. But still, I figured if I was going to savage this flick in the way it so richly deserves to be savaged, I should probably watch the entire thing to make sure there weren't any more awesome transcriptions I could make fun of. (Unfortunately, there aren't.)The basic premise here is that this is a ghost-hunter documentary that focuses on the ghosts of children at a few sites in the midwest. If you've seen a segment from any ghost-hunter television program, you've got a good idea of what you're going to get here, except every one of those is far more polished and professional than this. There's also an odd inversion; whereas with most of these sorts of things you're going to either get most of your time focused on the actual ghost hunting, with some background sketching or the filmmakers intercutting background info with the hunting, here it's almost all background; each of the hunting sequences (one for each site) lasts no more than five-ten minutes. What? All that build-up and then we get next to nothing?Something tells me that if you actually paid money for this turkey, you through it into the fire yourself.

Some EVP's are residual sounds from the past.  They do not always signify a active haunting. The k2 whatever meters that people are so fond of using, go off when near a cell phone.  Some investigators keep out cell phones of sight from the camera, but within range for the meter to go off when they want it to.I believe its especially a low blow to children to make a movie just about them and how so many can't go on.  Does it even occur to them that hanging around forgotten places and cemeteries where they setup equipment and such, is actually drawing spirits who don't want to leave the mortality of the world they left behind. By standing by a gravesite and reciting the deceased name over and over again might actually draw that spirit to the grave instead of just leaving him/her alone so that they can adjust to their new form of existence? I happen to believe in life after death, and I just get tired so many people sensationalizing psychic phenomena and manufacturing an abundance of ""evidence"" through the power of suggestion and atmosphere.An investigation is done as an investigation, otherwise without scientific evidence, it is just an entertaining story.  It's a very morbid and a awful thing to concentrate on the ""child spirit"" when there is no proof that they are actually there.  Through EVP research it has been found that some spirits can mimic children or even your own voice because it is only sound...
