458869,A2RJYV7Q6NOOD1,6305300739,Aizam Awang (Asegamss@Hotmail.com),"[5, 6]","I watched ""Progeny"" because of the fact that it was written by Stuart Gordon and it was directed by Brian Yuzna - in other words, I was expecting pure gore and nasty violence. I was surprised to discover ""Progeny"" a bit  disappointing in these areas. The storyline of the film was weak in itself  - it concerned around the problematic life of a doctor who suddenly found  that his wife was pregnant after a weird ""alien abduction"" experience that  they both had while having sex (they never succeeded in making babies  before): very typical and X-file-ish. Still, I found Yuzna's directing  interesting and the thematic consistency of the main imageries of the film  astonishing and I must say that I did enjoy watching the film. If you are  expecting a violent horror film typical of Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna,  you might get extremely disappointed, but for those who want to see the  beauty of Yuzna's passion for his material, you might be satisfied with  some of the imaginative scenes and twisted ending.",3,A Stereotypical Film With a Twist!,926899200,"05 17, 1999",1999,1013,"['watched', 'Progeny', 'fact', 'was', 'written', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', 'was', 'directed', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'expecting', 'pure', 'gore', 'nasty', 'violence', 'was', 'surprised', 'discover', 'Progeny', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'areas', 'storyline', 'film', 'was', 'weak', 'concerned', 'problematic', 'life', 'doctor', 'who', 'suddenly', 'found', 'wife', 'was', 'pregnant', 'weird', 'alien', 'abduction', 'experience', 'had', 'having', 'sex', 'never', 'succeeded', 'making', 'babies', 'very', 'typical', 'X-file-ish', 'Still', 'found', 'Yuzna', 'directing', 'interesting', 'thematic', 'consistency', 'main', 'imageries', 'film', 'astonishing', 'must', 'say', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'expecting', 'violent', 'horror', 'film', 'typical', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'might', 'get', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'beauty', 'Yuzna', 'passion', 'material', 'might', 'be', 'satisfied', 'imaginative', 'scenes', 'twisted', 'ending']",N/A

The actors do a great job, especially Brad Dourif. Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy&amp; The Mummy Returns) is Craig Barton, the surgeon who is sure that his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) has been impregnated by evil aliens. The movie does have a few surprises and carries out an uncanny mood.

I was certainly lost by then and totally confused by the end.  It seemed as though he or the author had  several &quot;neat&quot; ideas for an ending and used them all!  I also  wondered what or if a medical authority was consulted for the more  technical aspects of of the film; EKG leads, for instance, do not go on the  head!  And no surgeon worth his salt would ever do major abdominal surgery  under general anesthesia without first intubating and venting the patient.  What's sad is that there was a germ of a real film here that got left in  the dust, namely how does a couple unable to conceive a child they wand so  desparately deal with the emotional and marital problems that that can  create.  I think Mr. Vosloos's acting talents are certainly capable of  supporting a more socially weighty film than alien abductions; hope he gets  the opportunity to prove it.  I give the film 3 stars, like an earlier  reviewer, strictly on the basis of that gentleman's presence in the film.",3,ET in the ER,952732800,"03 11, 2000",2000,1099,"['tend', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'felt', 'director', 'lost', 'quot', 'direction', 'quot', 'somewhere', 'mid-film', 'was', 'certainly', 'lost', 'then', 'totally', 'confused', 'end', 'seemed', 'author', 'had', 'several', 'quot', 'quot', 'ideas', 'ending', 'used', 'also', 'wondered', 'what', 'medical', 'authority', 'was', 'consulted', 'more', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'EKG', 'instance', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'head', 'surgeon', 'salt', 'would', 'ever', 'do', 'major', 'abdominal', 'surgery', 'general', 'anesthesia', 'first', 'intubating', 'venting', 'patient', 'What', 'sad', 'was', 'germ', 'real', 'film', 'here', 'got', 'left', 'dust', 'namely', 'how', 'couple', 'unable', 'conceive', 'child', 'wand', 'so', 'desparately', 'deal', 'emotional', 'marital', 'problems', 'can', 'create', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Vosloos', 'acting', 'talents', 'are', 'certainly', 'capable', 'supporting', 'more', 'socially', 'film', 'alien', 'abductions', 'hope', 'opportunity', 'prove', 'give', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'strictly', 'basis', 'gentleman', 'presence', 'film']",N/A

One night they are interrupted by a bright light and they discover that two hours have gone by.  The husband is bothered by this but really freaks out when a bright light flashed in his eyes causes him to space out for a few minutes.  His wife is now pregnant.Hypnosis and seeing a TV spot about alien abduction gets him thinking.The film progresses nicely as the doctor becomes more and more convinced that there is something wrong with the baby his wife is carrying.  One of the great things about this film is that you are kept guessing as to whether he is crazy or not.This is much more of a psychological thriller than a gore fest, so those looking for the gore may be disappointed (there is a little), but those looking for a film with actual creepiness will find a tasty treat with this one.One other note, you might notice that the husband is almost always on screen (he does an excellent job).",4,Stuart Gordon Creates Another Thriller,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,1104,"['Considering', 'Stuart', 'quot', 'Re-Animator', 'quot', 'Gordon', 'much', 'closer', 'resemblance', 'Dagon', 'Re-Animator', 'atmosphere', 'style.A', 'doctor', 'wife', 'are', 'trying', 'have', 'baby', 'One', 'night', 'are', 'interrupted', 'bright', 'light', 'discover', 'two', 'hours', 'have', 'gone', 'husband', 'bothered', 'really', 'out', 'when', 'bright', 'light', 'flashed', 'eyes', 'space', 'out', 'few', 'minutes', 'wife', 'now', 'pregnant.Hypnosis', 'seeing', 'TV', 'spot', 'alien', 'abduction', 'thinking.The', 'film', 'nicely', 'doctor', 'more', 'more', 'convinced', 'something', 'wrong', 'baby', 'wife', 'carrying', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'kept', 'guessing', 'crazy', 'not.This', 'much', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'gore', 'fest', 'looking', 'gore', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'little', 'looking', 'film', 'actual', 'creepiness', 'will', 'find', 'tasty', 'treat', 'one.One', 'other', 'note', 'might', 'notice', 'husband', 'almost', 'always', 'screen', 'excellent', 'job']",N/A

I recently(YES I KNOW) saw The Mummy and The Mummy Returns on tv and was struck by the Character who played Imhotep. I was amazed at his screen presence and wanted to know more about him. Though Vosloo received limited screen time in the Mummy Movies, (Frazier was the lead)he stole the show! Vosloo seems to have an innate sensitivity--an a great strength about him. This is a man with a sense of who he is. I purchased this video to find out what he did before his big break.This movie starts out with a WONDERFUL(and I do mean wonderful) view of Arnold's posterior (I'm quivering and blushing as I type). I immediately hit the rewind button for another view of 'The Vos'. He is making love to his wife when something strange happens. Vosloo (An ER Doctor) tells his therapists that his and his wife's memory of that night is a bit hazy. Through hypnosis they both remember--that aliens impregnated her! Vos teams up with an alien abduction expert to save his(uncooperative)wife before it is to late.Cast includes Craig Burton (Arnold Vosloo), his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) and alien abuction expert Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif).This is a B movie with a B storyline, but Vosloo fans (myself included) should not be disappointed.",5,Only For Arnold Vosloo,1012089600,"01 27, 2002",2002,1281,"['have', 'say', 'am', 'latecomer', 'Vosloo', 'recently', 'YES', 'KNOW', 'saw', 'Mummy', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'tv', 'was', 'struck', 'Character', 'who', 'played', 'Imhotep', 'was', 'amazed', 'screen', 'presence', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'Vosloo', 'received', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'Mummy', 'Movies', 'Frazier', 'was', 'lead', 'stole', 'show', 'Vosloo', 'have', 'innate', 'sensitivity', 'great', 'strength', 'man', 'sense', 'who', 'purchased', 'video', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'did', 'big', 'break.This', 'movie', 'out', 'WONDERFUL', 'do', 'mean', 'wonderful', 'view', 'Arnold', 'posterior', ""'m"", 'quivering', 'blushing', 'type', 'immediately', 'hit', 'rewind', 'button', 'view', ""'The"", 'Vos', 'making', 'love', 'wife', 'when', 'something', 'strange', 'happens', 'Vosloo', 'ER', 'Doctor', 'therapists', 'wife', 'memory', 'night', 'bit', 'hazy', 'hypnosis', 'remember', 'aliens', 'impregnated', 'Vos', 'up', 'alien', 'abduction', 'expert', 'save', 'uncooperative', 'wife', 'late.Cast', 'Craig', 'Burton', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'wife', 'Sherry', 'Jillian', 'McWhirter', 'alien', 'abuction', 'expert', 'Bert', 'Clavell', 'Brad', 'Dourif', '.This', 'B', 'movie', 'B', 'storyline', 'Vosloo', 'fans', 'included', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
