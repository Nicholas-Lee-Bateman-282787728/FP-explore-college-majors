1640586,A3O8PRRQT3DPF8,B00BX8PG3Y,A. Anderson,"[3, 5]","Just requested this new Blu-Ray/DVD combo of the stage musical of Shrek, I popped the disc into my Blu-Ray player and it loaded quickly, played the 20th Century Fox logo and then promptly stopped.  It even indicated STOP on my display. I hit the MENU button, it played the Fox logo once more and ... it stopped. I popped in the DVD version and it played just fine (for a DVD, grainy, fuzzy etc).  I looked online, sure enough many reviewers had the same issue, trouble loading the disc menu to play the feature.  So I decided to send it back and try my luck at another copy.  It arrived and the exact same problem occurred.  Made sure ALL firmware was up to date, etc.  So I sent it back as well. So, it seem this first printing is a BAD printing of SHREK THE MUSICAL.  Fox let's re-issue the disc please, I would like to keep a copy on Blu-Ray in my collection.

1640591,A3KZLC8UFCQ8NU,B00BX8PG3Y,cherryblueberry,"[5, 8]","We just saw this Shrek the Musical on DVD.  First of all, let me say...my daughter is the HUGEST Shrek fan around.  Second of all, let me say....we all loved watching this!Which is probably why you will find it odd when I say:  It wasn't all that good!  WHAAAAT?  What I mean is: ""It Probably Won't Win Any Awards"" sort of good. However, for just plain old silly fun LAUGH OUT LOUD entertainment, this movie/musical is definitely something you'll want to see...and add to your DVD collection!The story moves along at a lively pace with never a dull moment.  (In case you are the only person on earth not familiar with Shrek, he is a smelly yet likable ogre who finds his swamp over-run with multitudes of fairy creature squatters.  In order to get rid of them, he must rescue the princess Fiona from the Dragon's Keep, and return her to the self centered ninny Lord Farquod).  The play is also very colorful with wonderful scenery.  The music is enjoyable - and the costumes are fantastic.  Sutton Foster as Fiona is amazing  (I miss you on Bunheads, Sutton)!In Shrek the Musical, we learn some interesting ""back story"" about Shrek.  Mostly, though, the play sticks to the first Shrek movie plot.  All the favorites are there - including Pinnocchio, the gingerbread man, the three pigs, the gender confused wolf, and others.What was wrong with the musical?  Well...there were a few sort of tasteless lines they could have done without, such as one of the fairy creatures claiming that the swamp ""smelled like butt.""  Just....no.....Also, they kept calling the gender confused wolf a cross-dressing wolf - I guess to be ""edgier,"" since being edgy is so in style lately.  Really though...not necessary.There were some bodily functions jokes which my husband loved.......little kids also will love them, trust me......but...just be prepared.  The actors pull it all off in a mostly likable way, though...it's just all part of the pervasive silliness.And speaking of silly, YES, that is the word of the day when it comes to this musical!  It is much sillier than the actual Shrek movie.  My family couldn't stop laughing, so I guess that's a good thing, right?  Laughing is healthy and fun - and this musical will definitely make you laugh!  Another good thing, is that this DVD is good for ALL AGES!  It's nice to have something the whole family can enjoy.  So....especially if you have young children.....BUY THIS DVD, and just enjoy watching something fun and silly...TOGETHER!",4,"Shrek, the SILLY Musical!",1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,2476,"['just', 'saw', 'Shrek', 'Musical', 'DVD', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'daughter', 'HUGEST', 'Shrek', 'fan', 'around', 'Second', 'let', 'say', 'loved', 'watching', 'Which', 'probably', 'why', 'will', 'find', 'odd', 'when', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'WHAAAAT', 'What', 'mean', 'Probably', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Win', 'Any', 'Awards', 'sort', 'good', 'However', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'silly', 'fun', 'LAUGH', 'OUT', 'LOUD', 'entertainment', 'movie/musical', 'definitely', 'something', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection', 'story', 'along', 'lively', 'pace', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'case', 'are', 'only', 'person', 'earth', 'not', 'familiar', 'Shrek', 'smelly', 'yet', 'likable', 'ogre', 'who', 'swamp', 'over-run', 'multitudes', 'fairy', 'creature', 'squatters', 'order', 'get', 'rid', 'must', 'rescue', 'princess', 'Fiona', 'Dragon', 'Keep', 'return', 'self', 'centered', 'ninny', 'Lord', 'Farquod', 'play', 'also', 'very', 'colorful', 'wonderful', 'scenery', 'music', 'enjoyable', 'costumes', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Sutton', 'Foster', 'Fiona', 'amazing', 'miss', 'Bunheads', 'Sutton', 'Shrek', 'Musical', 'learn', 'interesting', 'back', 'story', 'Shrek', 'Mostly', 'though', 'play', 'first', 'Shrek', 'movie', 'plot', 'favorites', 'are', 'there', 'including', 'Pinnocchio', 'gingerbread', 'man', 'three', 'pigs', 'gender', 'confused', 'wolf', 'was', 'wrong', 'musical', 'Well', 'were', 'few', 'sort', 'tasteless', 'lines', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'such', 'one', 'fairy', 'claiming', 'swamp', 'smelled', 'butt', 'Just', '.no', '..Also', 'kept', 'calling', 'gender', 'confused', 'wolf', 'cross-dressing', 'wolf', 'guess', 'be', 'edgier', 'being', 'edgy', 'so', 'style', 'lately', 'Really', 'not', 'were', 'bodily', 'functions', 'jokes', 'husband', 'loved', '.little', 'kids', 'also', 'will', 'love', 'trust', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'actors', 'pull', 'off', 'mostly', 'likable', 'way', 'just', 'part', 'pervasive', 'silliness.And', 'speaking', 'silly', 'YES', 'word', 'day', 'when', 'musical', 'much', 'sillier', 'actual', 'Shrek', 'movie', 'family', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'guess', 'good', 'thing', 'right', 'Laughing', 'healthy', 'fun', 'musical', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'laugh', 'good', 'thing', 'DVD', 'good', 'AGES', 'nice', 'have', 'something', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'So', '.especially', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'just', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'something', 'fun', 'silly', 'TOGETHER']",N/A

While not every musical has turned out, and I have seen my share of flops too, this was not one of them. I was a bit skeptical at first, not knowing what to expect, and wondering whether the musical would be lacking in regards to story line, or whether it would simply be a retelling of the movie itself, it wasn't. Filled with amazing acting, great songs, and tons of humor, this was a great musical that kept my family and I laughing and loving every minute of it from beginning to end.I was so glad that this was the original cast as I am a huge fan of Sutton Foster and Brian d'Arcy and knew that they had done an amazing job in this too, but alas I was not able to see it while they were in it (in it's NYC run). Beyond these two actors though I have to say that the whole cast just worked. They acted as a team, which you don't always see on stage.This was a fun musical for the whole family!

I've had the CD for a couple of years and still enjoy the music, but until I ran across it accidentally on Amazon, I didn't even know it existed.  The show is more enjoyable if you've already seen the cartoon, since little effort went into the story line.  The songs are lively, spirited, and want you to sing along.  The acting is good with reasonable camera work.  No video can match a live show, but this really tries hard.  Broadway, are you listening?  There are a lot of shows that either can't tour due to set design, or won't tour due to closing early.  A video might help in the bottom line.I have only two complaints:  1. The DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital copy doesn't transfer to a Mac computer, even though it is coming from iTunes.  Apparently it only connects with a PC.  The Ultraviolet expects you to join Vudu of Flixter to watch it on your portable device.

I hope that a lot of people buy this, so that videos of Broadway musicals become an important revenue flow and are made  available for most such shows. However, they should not be as badly directed and edited as this.  It is likely that this video is meant for those who would usually be disinclined to buy a video of a Broadway musical.  A clue is that there is no mention of any of the cast, writers or director anywhere whatsoever in the packaging.Firstly, Shrek - The Musical is a mediocre musical with undistinguished, sometimes bouncy music and the preachy, not always appropriate for kids libretto, but that is NOT my problem with the video. The main camera is placed at such a low level that we are often looking up at the performances from below.  The angle is uncomfortable to watch and makes the actors look odd and the sets look ugly.  The relentless cross cutting, camera movement and up the actor's noses close-ups further contribute to make the video uncomfortable to watch, and an assault on our senses.And how can anyone not know that the curtain calls are an integral part of the theatre going experience.  Without them (and they are at least as carefully directed and choreographed as anything else in the show), the video is simply incomplete.  In place of the curtain calls, there is a post video, credit sequence in which the (about) half dozen lead actors are individually credited on screen while stills of them from the performance (including one still of each one's bows).  The balance of the end credits are on a standard crawl.  It would have been better, although still unsatisfactory, if the curtain calls were at least added as a bonus feature. The video is extremely sparse as to bonus features.Compared to the sensational video of Phantom of the Opera (I think its from an Australian production) and the fine video of Memphis (B'way production), this video is a major step backward.",3,Badly directed for Video w/ curtain calls edited out,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,1995,"['do', 'get', 'most', 'show', 'must', 'have', 'musical', 'theatre', 'buffs', 'hope', 'lot', 'people', 'buy', 'videos', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'become', 'important', 'revenue', 'flow', 'are', 'made', 'available', 'most', 'such', 'shows', 'However', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'badly', 'directed', 'edited', 'likely', 'video', 'meant', 'who', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'disinclined', 'buy', 'video', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'clue', 'mention', 'cast', 'writers', 'director', 'anywhere', 'whatsoever', 'packaging.Firstly', 'Shrek', 'Musical', 'mediocre', 'musical', 'undistinguished', 'sometimes', 'bouncy', 'music', 'preachy', 'not', 'always', 'appropriate', 'kids', 'libretto', 'NOT', 'problem', 'video', 'main', 'camera', 'placed', 'low', 'level', 'are', 'often', 'looking', 'up', 'performances', 'angle', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'actors', 'look', 'odd', 'sets', 'look', 'ugly', 'relentless', 'cross', 'cutting', 'camera', 'movement', 'actor', 'noses', 'close-ups', 'further', 'contribute', 'make', 'video', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'assault', 'senses.And', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'not', 'know', 'curtain', 'calls', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'theatre', 'going', 'experience', 'are', 'least', 'carefully', 'directed', 'choreographed', 'anything', 'else', 'show', 'video', 'simply', 'incomplete', 'place', 'curtain', 'post', 'video', 'credit', 'sequence', 'half', 'dozen', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'individually', 'credited', 'screen', 'stills', 'performance', 'including', 'one', 'still', 'one', 'bows', 'balance', 'end', 'credits', 'are', 'standard', 'crawl', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'still', 'unsatisfactory', 'curtain', 'calls', 'were', 'least', 'added', 'bonus', 'feature', 'video', 'extremely', 'sparse', 'bonus', 'features.Compared', 'sensational', 'video', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'think', 'Australian', 'production', 'fine', 'video', 'Memphis', ""B'way"", 'production', 'video', 'major', 'step', 'backward']",N/A
1640605,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BX8PG3Y,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[28, 30]","While generally I'm opposed to the trend of turning every movie into a big theater production, some certainly lend themselves to the format better than others. It's a symbol of our times, a Broadway production is so expensive and so risky, they want those seats pre-sold with a familiar brand. That's the same reason we get so many carbon copy sequels and remakes in the cineplexes! Whatever happened to actual creativity? When I watched the original ""Shrek"" at the movies, I thought it was one of the five very best films of the year (that was the year the Academy created the Best Animation category and gave ""Shrek"" the award, but I've always maintained it should have been up for Best Picture as well). It was smart AND slyly subversive, pleasing for the kids at face value and a treat for adults in its scathing satire and wit. Needless to say, I wasn't thrilled with the many sequels that followed (although most were serviceable) and I groaned when I heard the green ogre was going to Broadway. For every movie to theater flop (for example, I loathed both Footloose and Saturday Night Fever), there are pleasant surprises (who knew Legally Blonde would be so much fun). ""Shrek,"" due to its source material, colorful staging, and exquisite cast, makes the transition relatively smoothly.This filmed production of the Broadway show benefits greatly from the enthusiastic and extremely talented actors. The Original Broadway cast in this presentation include the great Sutton Foster (Fiona), Brian d'Arcy James (Shrek), Daniel Breaker (Donkey), Christopher Sieber (Lord Farquaad), John Tartaglia (Pinocchio) and Haven Burton (Gingy). Foster, d'Arcy James, and Sieber all picked up Tony nominations with the show picking up another five (including Best Musical). Alas, it only won for Best Costumes, but that was well deserved once you see the get-ups that the actors have to endure. I particularly enjoy Lord Farquaad's diminutive lower half, but its hilarious sight-gag oftentimes takes focus away from Sieber's nifty performance. Along with these delicious and over-the-top costumes, the sets are outlandish, the staging is crisp, and the songs are fitfully amusing. The filmed performance was captured with enough cameras to keep the audience on top of the action so, even though it's not live, you still feel caught up in unfolding events.Special DVD Features: The set has DVD, Blu-ray, and Digital versions. On the Blu-ray only, there is ""From Swamp to Stage,"" a making-of featurette. On both the Blu-ray and DVD, there is ""Shrek The Musical Songbook with Sing-Along"" that has seven songs that will play with the lyrics along the bottom of the screen.The plot of ""Shrek,"" such as it is, has our ogre and his Donkey friend embarking on a quest. Similar to the time frame of the original ""Shrek"" but with a new story line, the musical is populated by endless gags, juvenile antics, and wacky slapstick. It's in comedy overdrive throughout, but the essence of what makes ""Shrek"" so endearing remains. Despite the tackiness and mild crudity, this guy has heart. He is as lovable as can be. The show, itself, plays well for younger audiences due to its frantic nature. Little ones might not get every joke and reference, but that's what will keep the adults entertained as well. The eclectic soundtrack works well and keeps things lively veering through many genres of music including R&B;, jazz, rock, power ballads and old-fashioned show tunes. Some are relatively straightforward, but many are clever and laugh out loud funny. I really enjoyed the musical interpretation of ""Shrek."" I don't necessarily think it's a new classic, but it is colorful and fun.

1640617,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00BX8PG3Y,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[15, 16]","When Dreamworks first released the original CGI film, SHREK, it gave Disney's animation studio a run for their money. It even poked fun at Disney characters. It took the position that adults could enjoy some double-entendre humor while the kids would love the graphics. SHREK spawned two sequels too! Then Dreamworks decided (like Disney with ""Beauty and the Beast"" to conquer Broadway by creating - and producing - a musical version of the film. The 2009 show got nine Tony noms (no wins) and played successfully in NY. A whopping 17 songs (in a two-hour show) were composed by Pulitzer Prize winner David Lindsay-Abaire and Jeanine Tesori to keep the show going. The music is - in my opinion - a combination of Alan Menken's score for ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and Marc Shaiman's for ""Hairspray"". A lot of fun.So, with Dreamworks being a FILM company, they decided to film a live performance with the ORIGINAL Broadway Cast (before they left the company). And that resulted in this 2012 production, just out on DVD and BD.There are already quite a few reviews here - and you probably already know the basic story line - so I won't repeat much of what has been written but will ""fill in"" some more info.First, I agree with others in that I'm thankful that an ORIGINAL CAST production has been captured and preserved for generations to come. Very few, if any, such productions have been made for the general public to see. You don't need to travel to New York, or even spent $50-$70 for a ticket for a touring production, to  enjoy the show. And you'd never be this close. The Director of the filmed production has a tough job deciding when to show the whole stage and when to use close-ups and director Michael Warren did a pretty good job with his 10 cameras. And the makeup is so good that it doesn't even look like makeup on the close shots.Someone questioned the ""off color"" humor and I will alert you that there is a musical number based on flatulence but it's done lightly and is the kind of humor that kids find ""silly"". There are no expletives in the dialogue.Another reviewer said there was not a curtain call. There certainly is. First we are given the one non-original song. It's the curtain call number: The Monkees' hit ""I'm a Believer"". And then the major cast members are identified as they take their bows.The bonuses on the DVD and BD are slightly different. Both have a really nice feature called ""Shrek: The Musical Songbook"" which allows you to replay seven of the musical numbers with a further option of having the lyrics on the screen to sing along. The BD is in High Def as well as having one extra bonus: ""From Swamp to Stage"" - a brief 8 minute featurette (introduced by Cameron Diaz - from the animated version) with comments from the composers. There is also a set of promos for other Dreamworks Animation films.Considering the price of a Broadway show ticket and the fact that this cast will never be together again, this DVD BD is a bargain and a must for Broadway cast lovers. A solid FIVE stars from me.Let's hope more producing companies give us opportunities like Dreamworks is.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Review of BD -The original cast production preserved - for generations to come.

Harpster ""STAGE MANAGER""","[0, 0]","I do love Broadway shows...and I am happy that more and more are being filmed on stage....However,  SHREK does not rate high on my list of favorite shows.  Don't get me wrong, I am very happy that this has been filmed on stage live....I am just not happy with theshow itself.  The performances by Brian D'arcy James and Sutton Foster  are worth the price of the show..these actpors are marvelous!  Perhaps it is the story itself, but I didn't like the cartoon (excuse me animated feature) to begin with.  But if you are a true Broadway fan like me, this show SHREK is worth having in your collection just for the lead actors.Thanks!",4,Broadway on Film!,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,632,"['do', 'love', 'Broadway', 'shows', 'am', 'happy', 'more', 'more', 'are', 'being', 'filmed', 'stage', '.However', 'SHREK', 'not', 'rate', 'high', 'list', 'favorite', 'shows', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'been', 'filmed', 'stage', 'live', '.I', 'am', 'just', 'not', 'happy', 'theshow', 'performances', 'Brian', ""D'arcy"", 'James', 'Sutton', 'Foster', 'are', 'price', 'show..these', 'actpors', 'are', 'marvelous', 'Perhaps', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'cartoon', 'animated', 'feature', 'begin', 'are', 'true', 'Broadway', 'fan', 'show', 'SHREK', 'worth', 'having', 'collection', 'just', 'lead', 'actors.Thanks']",N/A
