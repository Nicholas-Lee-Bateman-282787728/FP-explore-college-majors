If you offend easily go elsewhere.Then the guy got the main role for Doctor Who, then I found this.Enjoyable, intense &#34;flavor&#34;, sort of like black pepper, love the flavor of it, but a little goes a long way and I wouldn't put it on everything.  Also has a tendency to become one noted after awhile, relying heavily on the profanity and attitude of the main character to drive things forwards, definitely works and in small doses is fun, but I fast forwarded through season one in one night and that was a bit much.Get the series, keep it in your back pocket.

The aspect which stands out for me is how much of their time is spent as politicians and their aides on how they will be perceived by the media and the public.  I would estimate over ninety percent of their time.  The time spent on actual legislation is less than ten percent.  I suspect way less. When I think about it though, doesn't a democracy virtually guarantee this? That most of one's time will be spent keeping the majority of people who vote content, if not happy?I never quite figure out what this Minister for Social Affairs does and he seems equally at sea as to his purpose.  He does have to answer to Malcolm, the PM's communications honcho.  He is brilliant.  His entire job is putting out brush fires with ministers and there seems to be a continual onslaught of those.This is also shot as if it is a semi documentary and not a sit com.

We must not imagine but realize we are governed by this kind of social climbers, this kind of social egotistic selfish egocentric psychopaths who only try to capture some power, not really for the power of it, or at the most the power it provides them with over their direct employees, their direct associates, their friends who are friends as long as they are useful. These people have no vision whatsoever. They can advocate a solution today and exactly the reverse on the following day. They can be gross and pretend they are dainty, or just plain liars and let you know they are suffering so much because they told a lie because they could not avoid telling such a lie because otherwise their wives, husbands, spouses, boy or girl friends, plain friends, children pets or even gold fish, or whatever, would have suffered in a way or another if they had not changed positions and convictions during the night and over the week end. Then you end up wondering why they are in their position of power, who in hell elected them, and you suddenly realize you elected them by not voting at all or by wasting your vote on a marginal side-kick candidate. After seeing such a perilous voyage in the stormy waters of political intrigue and the schizophrenic superman complex, you can only finally decide to vote for the good side next time. But is there a good side? Can we vote for Head without seeing that Head entails Tail, or vice versa? The only thing that changes in these people are not the teeth but the dentures. They all bite abundantly with steel or gold but always with gusto since for them the public is a piece of meat and the media are the pepper and the salt of the barbecued beef.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",5,"The Realm of the Bees, Blair, Brown, Brush them off",1243987200,"06 3, 2009",2009,1851,"['fabulous', 'definitely', 'not', 'funny', 'must', 'not', 'imagine', 'realize', 'are', 'governed', 'kind', 'social', 'climbers', 'kind', 'social', 'egotistic', 'selfish', 'egocentric', 'psychopaths', 'who', 'only', 'try', 'capture', 'power', 'not', 'really', 'power', 'most', 'power', 'direct', 'employees', 'direct', 'associates', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'useful', 'people', 'have', 'vision', 'whatsoever', 'can', 'advocate', 'solution', 'today', 'exactly', 'reverse', 'following', 'day', 'can', 'be', 'gross', 'pretend', 'are', 'dainty', 'just', 'plain', 'liars', 'let', 'know', 'are', 'suffering', 'so', 'much', 'told', 'lie', 'could', 'not', 'avoid', 'telling', 'such', 'lie', 'otherwise', 'wives', 'husbands', 'spouses', 'boy', 'girl', 'friends', 'plain', 'friends', 'children', 'pets', 'even', 'gold', 'fish', 'whatever', 'would', 'have', 'suffered', 'way', 'had', 'not', 'changed', 'positions', 'convictions', 'night', 'week', 'end', 'Then', 'end', 'up', 'wondering', 'why', 'are', 'position', 'power', 'who', 'hell', 'elected', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'elected', 'not', 'voting', 'wasting', 'vote', 'marginal', 'side-kick', 'candidate', 'seeing', 'such', 'perilous', 'voyage', 'stormy', 'waters', 'political', 'intrigue', 'schizophrenic', 'superman', 'complex', 'can', 'only', 'finally', 'decide', 'vote', 'good', 'side', 'next', 'time', 'there', 'good', 'side', 'Can', 'vote', 'Head', 'seeing', 'Head', 'entails', 'Tail', 'vice', 'versa', 'only', 'thing', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'teeth', 'dentures', 'bite', 'abundantly', 'steel', 'gold', 'always', 'gusto', 'public', 'piece', 'meat', 'media', 'are', 'pepper', 'salt', 'barbecued', 'beef.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",N/A
