Harris ""Film aficionado""","[31, 41]","There's probably not a lot I can say about ""Vicious Circle,"" Dane Cook's Boston performance in the round filmed for HBO.  Whether or not you enjoy a one-man comedy concert largely depends on how much you enjoy the particular comedian.  Dane Cook has obviously become huge in the last few years, and this concert showcase is very likely to please his fans.Dane Cook is not the most cutting-edge comic, his material will never be construed as dark or dangerous.  But what he has going for him is a real likability factor.  He is a gifted storyteller assuming different voices and really throwing his whole body into the routine.  In a goofy, non-threatening way--he's the guy you want to be your best friend, the class clown and the genial fratboy all rolled up into one.The success of his comedy lies in the fact that he spins instantly recognizable scenarios.  It is very easy to identify with him as a person, and it's easy to relate to his jokes.  There is just something universal and true in most of his performance, so you can appreciate it and see yourself in his observations.  Very watchable and entertaining, I enjoyed this concert.  I think Dane is a great talent and my hope is for him to someday parlay his gift into making movies more worthy of his appeal (yes, I'm talking ""Employee of the Month"")!

However, you'd never know it by watching Vicious Circle, which finds the stand up comedian filling a huge arena of rousing fans.  Now I found most of Cook's earlier material much better than anything found in Vicious Circle, and many of those who loved his older material may be disappointed with what they get here, much like his HBO series Tourgasm.  Many of his jokes fall flat, though some of his material, including stories about theft, are very funny.  Other than that though, there isn't much here that we haven't seen or heard before, and heard better.  However, despite all the negative press I've just given it, it's crystal clear that Cook absolutely loves his fans, and that his fans absolutely love him.  Frequently Cook addresses and comes in contact with the fans populating the arena, and he is obviously having a blast doing what he does.  That itself is a welcome sight to see for a big time star (which Cook has become), so maybe there will be better things to come from Cook, hopefully.

Now that's an accomplishment for a rock band, much less a stand up comedian.Unfortunately, I didn't feel that this particular routine warranted 18,000 people being there to witness it live. It has its moments of hilarity, but they aren't as prevalent as I would expect for a comedian with as many rabid young fans as Dane Cook has. Or maybe that's to be expected when most shots of the audience reveal screaming 17 year olds. I noticed the audience laughed a little less when he made higher brow jokes. Not to worry, though, he rarely makes those.The main force of his comedy is that he's a likable guy. A likable guy with an apparently unending energy inside himself. He runs around the stage, yells, and pantomimes his way through the entire act.The weirdest part about this act is that a lot of the longer bits that were supposed to be ""telling"" of human folly, etc. as comics often do, really seemed strangely off base and disconnected from the real world. I've seen him do much better.Overall, I was disappointed in this entire routine and found myself liking Cook less and less as it progressed, even though there were definitely some laugh til it hurts moments.The special featurette that shows Cook talking about his standup and preparing for this huge performance really shows the endearing side of Dane Cook the human, and shows how devoted to him his fans are.
