502579,A3SISQ2T7BCXLJ,B00000IBUW,A. Customer,"[30, 37]","Within the first 20 minutes I knew that this would be an overall terrible movie.The ""war"" aspect of it is EXTREMELY inaccurate....M-16A2s currently in use are NOT fully automatic, a small squad of three soldiers would not go running from building to building nor EVER pursue 2 individuals through alleyways for hundreds of meters, and they would definitely NEVER leave a wounded soldier alone and say ""Don't worry a medic is on it's way"", and in an ambush two unarmored vehicles, or any for that matter, would split off the main group and drive off on their own.  All this happens within 10 minutes of each other.  As a currently soldier, I wanted to throw my size 10 boot through my TV.And then comes the main point of this movie (wait, is there even a point to this nonsensical crap?) which is their return home and struggles with PTSD.  Sadly, the American public is overall blind to what PTSD truly is, and this movie doesn't help.  Not every soldier, even those with PTSD, struggle with their lives, violence, and alcoholism.  It seems this movie was written by anti-American, anti-soldier, bitter individuals with a grudge against the Army.  It portrays them as hopeless losers who can't function in society at all.  So, sadly, this movie continues to add to the stigma of the wounded.Aside from people like Mark Cuban and Stephen King, who think all soldiers are murders and rapists or uneducated idiots (seriously, look at what either of these two say!) I can't think of anyone who would watch this movie and enjoy it in the slightest.  Even the movie Stop Loss, made by MTV of all companies, was far more accurate in depicting PTSD.",1,"Inaccurate, left wing slanted, anti-soldier crap",1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1641,"['first', '20', 'minutes', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'overall', 'terrible', 'movie.The', 'war', 'aspect', 'EXTREMELY', 'inaccurate', '.M-16A2s', 'currently', 'use', 'are', 'NOT', 'fully', 'automatic', 'small', 'squad', 'three', 'soldiers', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'running', 'building', 'building', 'EVER', 'pursue', '2', 'individuals', 'alleyways', 'hundreds', 'meters', 'would', 'definitely', 'NEVER', 'leave', 'wounded', 'soldier', 'alone', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'medic', 'way', 'ambush', 'two', 'unarmored', 'vehicles', 'matter', 'would', 'split', 'off', 'main', 'group', 'drive', 'off', 'own', '10', 'minutes', 'other', 'currently', 'soldier', 'wanted', 'throw', 'size', '10', 'boot', 'TV.And', 'then', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'wait', 'there', 'even', 'point', 'nonsensical', 'crap', 'return', 'home', 'struggles', 'PTSD', 'Sadly', 'American', 'public', 'overall', 'blind', 'what', 'PTSD', 'truly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'help', 'Not', 'soldier', 'even', 'PTSD', 'struggle', 'lives', 'violence', 'alcoholism', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'anti-American', 'anti-soldier', 'bitter', 'individuals', 'grudge', 'Army', 'hopeless', 'losers', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'function', 'society', 'So', 'sadly', 'movie', 'add', 'stigma', 'wounded.Aside', 'people', 'Mark', 'Cuban', 'Stephen', 'King', 'who', 'think', 'soldiers', 'are', 'murders', 'rapists', 'uneducated', 'idiots', 'seriously', 'look', 'what', 'two', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'slightest', 'Even', 'movie', 'Stop', 'Loss', 'made', 'MTV', 'companies', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'accurate', 'depicting', 'PTSD']",N/A
502580,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00000IBUW,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Home of the Brave, 2006 filmThis story begins in what seems to be Iraq. [The hilly dry land reminds me of southern California.] An Army doctor treats a young child. The soldiers play games. Some soldiers are selected for an escort for a medical supplies truck. They pass through a town. A truck blocks the narrow street. People run for cover, there is an ambush! Two trucks take a detour. An Improvised Explosive Device hits the trucks! There are casualties, they need a Medivac helicopter. Their war is over. We see their home life. Life is different. We see the neighbors. Not all return alive. There is a funeral. Another soldier is getting therapy in a hospital.The souvenirs of a dead soldier are reviewed. ""I gave that to him!"" One soldier adjusts to a lost arm. Another finds his old job was filled; he now works as a cashier in a movie theater. He recalls the ""Good War"", where Europeans welcomed the American soldiers who liberated them from Nazi oppression. At night traffic causes a problem. Why is he restless at night? Soldiers talk about their problems over past memories. ""Whatever."" The wounds have an after-effect. ""What'd I do?""Vanessa visits Dr. Marsh. ""Good to see you."" Public schools have rules. ""Buck Bush""? [No offense except what you read into it.] A teenage son thinks for himself. Dr. Marsh has conflicts at home. Vanessa uses her plastic arm well. There is an incident with Jemal, he has a problem with his job and his family. It ends badly. There is an emotional after effect. Dr. Marsh takes too much of his medicine, and brings unexpected guests home for Thanksgiving. He talks to his family.One veteran talks about his memories. Does he belong at home anymore? Dr. Marsh talks about his experiences during a surprise attack. More casualties and emotional experiences overwhelm him after a long 12-hour shift. ""I don't feel anything."" [Doctors should always be cool and unemotional for their work.] Vanessa talks about the time of her accident. She was very lucky. She finds a new boyfriend. ""Forget it.""Dr. Marsh works on his problems. He talked to his son. One soldier reenlists, he doesn't belong at home. ""I'm going back to do the best job I can do."" [Was this some sort of advertising to get recruits for the war?] ""Wars begin where you will but don't end where you please"" wrote Machiavelli. [It's easier to start a war than to end it.]Were there similar problems after World War One, Two, or Korea? Perhaps the better economy then prevented these problems? Maybe soldiers who believed in their mission had fewer problems. What about soldiers in other armies? Could this story be an argument for a new or expanded bureau to address these problems? Or is prevention better that a cure?",3,Life After Wartime,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,2721,"['Home', 'Brave', '2006', 'filmThis', 'story', 'what', 'be', 'Iraq', '[', 'hilly', 'dry', 'land', 'southern', 'California', ']', 'Army', 'doctor', 'young', 'child', 'soldiers', 'play', 'games', 'soldiers', 'are', 'selected', 'escort', 'medical', 'supplies', 'truck', 'pass', 'town', 'truck', 'narrow', 'street', 'People', 'run', 'cover', 'ambush', 'Two', 'trucks', 'take', 'detour', 'Improvised', 'Explosive', 'Device', 'trucks', 'are', 'casualties', 'need', 'Medivac', 'helicopter', 'Their', 'war', 'see', 'home', 'life', 'Life', 'different', 'see', 'neighbors', 'Not', 'return', 'alive', 'funeral', 'soldier', 'getting', 'therapy', 'hospital.The', 'souvenirs', 'dead', 'soldier', 'are', 'reviewed', 'gave', 'One', 'soldier', 'lost', 'arm', 'old', 'job', 'was', 'filled', 'now', 'cashier', 'movie', 'theater', 'Good', 'War', 'where', 'Europeans', 'welcomed', 'American', 'soldiers', 'who', 'liberated', 'Nazi', 'oppression', 'night', 'traffic', 'problem', 'Why', 'restless', 'night', 'Soldiers', 'talk', 'problems', 'past', 'memories', 'wounds', 'have', 'after-effect', 'What', ""'d"", 'do', 'Vanessa', 'visits', 'Dr.', 'Marsh', 'Good', 'see', 'Public', 'schools', 'have', 'rules', 'Buck', 'Bush', 'offense', 'what', 'read', ']', 'teenage', 'son', 'thinks', 'Dr.', 'Marsh', 'conflicts', 'home', 'Vanessa', 'plastic', 'arm', 'well', 'incident', 'Jemal', 'problem', 'job', 'family', 'badly', 'emotional', 'effect', 'Dr.', 'Marsh', 'too', 'much', 'medicine', 'brings', 'unexpected', 'guests', 'home', 'Thanksgiving', 'family.One', 'veteran', 'talks', 'memories', 'belong', 'home', 'anymore', 'Dr.', 'Marsh', 'talks', 'experiences', 'surprise', 'attack', 'More', 'casualties', 'emotional', 'experiences', 'overwhelm', 'long', '12-hour', 'shift', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', '[', 'Doctors', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'cool', 'unemotional', 'work', ']', 'Vanessa', 'talks', 'time', 'accident', 'was', 'very', 'lucky', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Forget', 'it.', 'Dr', 'Marsh', 'problems', 'talked', 'son', 'One', 'soldier', 'reenlists', ""n't"", 'belong', 'home', ""'m"", 'going', 'back', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'can', 'do', '[', 'Was', 'sort', 'advertising', 'get', 'recruits', 'war', ']', 'Wars', 'begin', 'where', 'will', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'where', 'please', 'wrote', 'Machiavelli', '[', 'easier', 'start', 'war', 'end', 'Were', 'there', 'similar', 'problems', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'Two', 'Korea', 'Perhaps', 'better', 'economy', 'then', 'prevented', 'problems', 'Maybe', 'soldiers', 'who', 'believed', 'mission', 'had', 'fewer', 'problems', 'What', 'soldiers', 'other', 'armies', 'Could', 'story', 'be', 'argument', 'new', 'expanded', 'bureau', 'address', 'problems', 'prevention', 'better', 'cure']",N/A

I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq and looked forward to watching this movie as an accurate analysis of the ""home front.""  Not to often does a war movie come out while the war rages on.  Unfortunatly, this movie was not an accurate representation of anything.The Iraq scene didn't make much sense and the ambush was painfully obvious.  The movie writers must not have hired a qualified military advisor as the entire first part of the movie was inacurate (especially how they wore their beret's...I couldn't help but notice.)  Little details demonstrated the lack of research and effort put in to this film.  From the very beginning until the end, the entire film was predictable.As stated in the Amazon review, the movie failed to take a strong stance on the war for either side and failed to provide a new perspective on soldiers re-adjustment when they return home.  Many other movies have allready touched this topic and with a lot more sucess.Strictly cinematicly speaking, the movie was horrible.  This was possibly the worst acting from ""good"" actors i've ever sceen.  The dialog is terrable and really makes the film un-enjoyable.Considering the big names, this is possibly the worst war drama I've ever seen.  I expected much more.

Irwin Winkler has made some good films (DeLovely, Life as a House, Guilty by Suspicion), but in this film he seems to be working against the script by Mark Friedman which has a tendency to oversimplify emotions and thus loses its impact.The film begins in Iraq where each of the main characters is at least tangentially connected.  Dr. Will Marsh (Samuel L. Jackson) is in a truck driven by Vanessa (Jessica Biel) and accompanied by soldiers Tommy (Brian Presley) and Jamal (50 Cent AKA Curtis Jackson) when a roadside bomb explodes, maiming the hand of Vanessa, killing Tommy's best friend, making Jamal witness unnecessary civilian deaths, and placing Will in an impotent position as a doctor.  Flash forward to Spokane, Washington where each of these four wounded people try to piece their lives together in a world that loathes the Iraq war (not at all unlike the treatment of soldiers returning from the unpopular Vietnam debacle), trying to make sense of it all.The problem with the good idea for a movie lies in the too traditional plot lines.  The actors (especially Presley and Biel) give it their all, but credibility enters and the smoke rises and we are left with a misplaced patriotism.  The message is strong: the delivery of it is shaky.

Chaos ensues, and all receive an injury in one way, shape, or form.  Weeks later they are all in Spokane, Washington and the four main characters (Vanessa - Jessica Biel, Will - Samuel L. Jackson, Jamal - Fiddy, and Tommy - Brian Presely) deal with piecing their lives together while many hate the war, and by proxy, hold that hatred against the soldiers involved in it.  The rest is just a person-by-person experience of individuals coping with semi-related post-war lives.Home of the Brave is controversial in that it's difficult for a movie-maker to relay a message that's very positive of the military life or the struggles of a soldier - and keep a job in Hollywood - but it's clear that the creators of this movie didn't even remotely try.  They paint a bleak picture of abandoned, abused, and shell-shocked soldiers who drink uncontrollably, can't control their anger, and can't relate to the ""civilian life"" outside of the foreign world of the military.  In that sense, Home of the Brave reminded me in many ways ofThe Things They Carriedby Tim O'Brien.  Pain often accompanies scars, but what doesn't always coincide mentally, however, is the visibility of those same scars.  Outward appearances don't always convey the truth of trauma or mental difficulties.With all that said, however, as a former soldier and family member of several generations of soldiers, I can say unequivocally that the image conveyed is hazy to say the least.  To be more accurate, it's slanted politically, with hints and outright displays of ignorant anti-war rhetoric, and reeks of the same type of elitist comments made by John Kerry about the correlation between being in the military and a lack of intelligence or education.While the biased, hyper-focus of the movie is on the troubled few, what's left out is the great majority who deal with their troubles without a comment or complaint.  Therein exists the truism of bravery, courage, honor, and sacrifice of the majority, and perhaps it would do the Hollywood folks a bit of good to concentrate a little more on those stories, because I've heard several and I'm sure there are countless more.",3,"As a former solider, this move is irritating",1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,2296,"['Mere', 'weeks', 'away', 'learning', 'unit', 'received', 'orders', 'go', 'home', 'Iraq', 'various', 'soldiers', 'go', 'humanitarian', 'mission', 'run', 'ambush', 'Chaos', 'ensues', 'receive', 'injury', 'one', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'later', 'are', 'Spokane', 'Washington', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'Vanessa', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Will', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Jamal', 'Fiddy', 'Tommy', 'Brian', 'Presely', 'deal', 'piecing', 'lives', 'together', 'many', 'hate', 'war', 'proxy', 'hold', 'hatred', 'soldiers', 'involved', 'rest', 'just', 'person-by-person', 'experience', 'individuals', 'coping', 'semi-related', 'post-war', 'lives.Home', 'Brave', 'controversial', 'difficult', 'movie-maker', 'relay', 'message', 'very', 'positive', 'military', 'life', 'struggles', 'soldier', 'keep', 'job', 'Hollywood', 'clear', 'creators', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'try', 'paint', 'bleak', 'picture', 'abandoned', 'abused', 'shell-shocked', 'soldiers', 'who', 'drink', 'uncontrollably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'anger', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'civilian', 'life', 'foreign', 'world', 'military', 'sense', 'Home', 'Brave', 'reminded', 'many', 'ways', 'ofThe', 'Things', 'Carriedby', 'Tim', ""O'Brien"", 'Pain', 'often', 'scars', 'what', ""n't"", 'always', 'coincide', 'mentally', 'however', 'visibility', 'same', 'scars', 'Outward', 'appearances', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'convey', 'truth', 'trauma', 'mental', 'difficulties.With', 'said', 'however', 'former', 'soldier', 'family', 'member', 'several', 'generations', 'soldiers', 'can', 'say', 'unequivocally', 'image', 'conveyed', 'hazy', 'say', 'least', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'slanted', 'politically', 'hints', 'outright', 'displays', 'ignorant', 'anti-war', 'rhetoric', 'reeks', 'same', 'type', 'elitist', 'comments', 'made', 'John', 'Kerry', 'correlation', 'being', 'military', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'education.While', 'biased', 'hyper-focus', 'movie', 'troubled', 'few', 'what', 'left', 'out', 'great', 'majority', 'who', 'deal', 'troubles', 'comment', 'complaint', 'Therein', 'truism', 'bravery', 'courage', 'honor', 'sacrifice', 'majority', 'perhaps', 'would', 'do', 'Hollywood', 'folks', 'bit', 'good', 'concentrate', 'little', 'more', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'several', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'countless', 'more']",N/A

502603,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00000IBUW,Joseph Haschka,"[23, 32]","At an advance screening of HOME OF THE BRAVE, the studio flunky introducing the picture claimed that it's the only film that's been made of one of America's wars while the U.S. was still fighting it. Oh, wrongo bongo! I can offhand think of three made about the Vietnam debacle during the period of that conflict: A YANK IN VIETNAM (1964), TO THE SHORES OF HELL (1966), and THE GREEN BERETS (1968). Perhaps the politically correct might tend to forget these as none were anti-war, and the last, starring John Wayne, was unabashedly pro-U.S. involvement. How quickly we forget that there were two sides to that debate.The first twenty or so minutes of HOME OF THE BRAVE, taking place in Iraq, is the introductory bit when we meet Will (Samuel L. Jackson), an Army medical officer assigned to a forward medical unit, and three Army enlisteds: Vanessa (Jessica Biel), a driver in a motor transport unit, and infantry grunts Tommy (Brian Presley) and Jamal (Curtis Jackson). While on a humanitarian aid mission, a military convoy carrying the four is caught in a vicious urban ambush that includes an explosive device hidden in the body of a dog.The balance of the film takes place in Spokane, WA, after the four return to the home base of their respective national guard units. Vanessa is now minus her right hand. Will, who'd been tasked with providing initial trauma care to so many horribly maimed young soldiers (including Vanessa), now finds himself emotionally disconnected from his civilian patients, while at the same time having to deal with the hostility emanating from his anti-war, teenage son. Jamal is wracked with guilt; while in pursuit of the convoy's attackers, he accidentally killed an Iraqi woman while searching her home. During that same pursuit, Tommy had his best friend die in his arms after the latter was twice shot in the back by an insurgent gunman.My screening's viewing audience was informed that Director Irwin Winkler thought the Iraqi war would be over by the time HOME OF THE BRAVE was released. Thus, it's perhaps not surprising that it doesn't overtly support or condemn our presence there since its appearance in American theaters was assumed to be after the fact. (Interestingly, one of the protagonists decides to return to Iraq for all the right reasons; reasons that may leave a lump in the viewer's throat.) Rather, it's an emotionally wrenching study of four average Americans left to cope in the normal world in the aftermath of violence. Each of the four principals gives an Oscar-worthy performance, as does the character of Will's long-suffering wife Penelope (Victoria Rowell), who discovers that life with hubby home doesn't meet long-harbored expectations.Of course, just as the media doesn't consider news worth reporting unless it's of the bad sort, HOME OF THE BRAVE ignores all those war veterans, perhaps a majority of those who have served or are serving, who ultimately return home to take up where they left off without having hit too devastating a speed bump in their lives. In any case, whether you support or condemn our nation's current entanglement in that wretched toilet of a country, you must necessarily come away from HOME OF THE BRAVE with an admiration and sympathy for our uniformed men and women that serve there.

Involved in the attack are Samuel Jackson as a military doctor, Jessica Biel as a driver who loses a hand in the attack, and Brian Presley and Curtis Jackson as two soldiers who are not only wounded but lose a friend in the attack.The  ambush/attack runs out the first 15 minutes or so but the better part of the film takes a look behind the scenes at these same soldiers after their return. Each one has their own difficulties adjusting to life stateside. Each one has their own demons to battle. And each one is a member of the walking wounded who return home.Jackson returns to private practice, slowly developing an overdependence on alcohol. Biel feels full of self pity over the handicap she must now overcome. Presley feels like he doesn't belong and Jackson is the vet who can't seem to get anyone to help or even to listen to him. Their stories coincide with one another, but never to a culmination of all in one place at the same time. Instead, each finds their own solution to the problems they bring back with them.The performances here are top notch, especially considering that the characters range from new to clich&eacute;. I doubt that Samuel Jackson could do anything less than a great performance. But at the same time the movie leaves you unfulfilled, making you feel as if you've been given a glimpse of only a part of the story.There is little doubt that war and combat would have an effect on a person. But Hollywood seems determined to portray soldiers these days as people with not ability to function once they leave the military. That or they become crazed maniacs. While John Wayne may have been an over the top die hard good guy in WW II films, these days it seems that soldiers returning home are psychos, a trend begun with the anti-war films from the Vietnam era. Remember Christopher Walken in THE DEER HUNTER or Stallone's character in the first FIRST BLOOD film. Both came off as damaged goods who were unable to fit back in to society. Somehow I don't believe that every vet that comes home is scarred beyond the ability to come back.The bravest part of this film lies in its decision not to justify nor vilify the war itself. Instead it looks at the effects of the war and not the war itself. The viewer is left to his or her own judgment on that issue. But as for those involved in the war, we are reminded that war is hell and has an effect on those in combat AND those at home.This is not a movie to simply entertain. It makes you think about the war and those involved. And perhaps that is a good thing. Not so much to take sides but to at least think about the whole issue through the eyes of people and not politicians.",4,YOU CAN'T GO HOME?,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,3007,"['beginning', 'film', 'way', 'had', 'own', 'version', 'soldiers', 'returning', 'battle', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'had', 'THE', 'BEST', 'YEARS', 'OUR', 'LIVES', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'had', 'THE', 'DEER', 'HUNTER', 'now', 'war', 'Iraq', 'HOME', 'THE', 'BRAVE.The', 'film', 'centers', 'group', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'attack', 'just', 'are', 'finally', 'head', 'home', 'Involved', 'attack', 'are', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'military', 'doctor', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'driver', 'who', 'hand', 'attack', 'Brian', 'Presley', 'Curtis', 'Jackson', 'two', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'wounded', 'lose', 'friend', 'attack.The', 'ambush/attack', 'out', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'better', 'part', 'film', 'look', 'scenes', 'same', 'soldiers', 'return', 'one', 'own', 'difficulties', 'adjusting', 'life', 'stateside', 'one', 'own', 'demons', 'battle', 'one', 'member', 'walking', 'wounded', 'who', 'return', 'home.Jackson', 'returns', 'private', 'practice', 'slowly', 'developing', 'overdependence', 'alcohol', 'Biel', 'full', 'self', 'pity', 'handicap', 'must', 'now', 'overcome', 'Presley', 'feels', ""n't"", 'belong', 'Jackson', 'vet', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'anyone', 'help', 'even', 'listen', 'stories', 'coincide', 'one', 'never', 'culmination', 'one', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'Instead', 'own', 'solution', 'problems', 'bring', 'back', 'them.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'especially', 'considering', 'characters', 'range', 'new', 'clich', 'eacute', 'doubt', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'could', 'do', 'anything', 'less', 'great', 'performance', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'unfulfilled', 'making', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'glimpse', 'only', 'part', 'story.There', 'little', 'doubt', 'war', 'combat', 'would', 'have', 'effect', 'person', 'Hollywood', 'determined', 'portray', 'soldiers', 'days', 'people', 'not', 'ability', 'function', 'once', 'leave', 'military', 'become', 'crazed', 'maniacs', 'John', 'Wayne', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'top', 'die', 'hard', 'good', 'guy', 'WW', 'II', 'films', 'days', 'soldiers', 'returning', 'home', 'are', 'psychos', 'trend', 'begun', 'anti-war', 'films', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'Remember', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'THE', 'DEER', 'HUNTER', 'Stallone', 'character', 'first', 'FIRST', 'BLOOD', 'film', 'came', 'off', 'damaged', 'goods', 'who', 'were', 'unable', 'fit', 'back', 'society', 'Somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'vet', 'home', 'scarred', 'ability', 'come', 'back.The', 'bravest', 'part', 'film', 'decision', 'not', 'justify', 'vilify', 'war', 'Instead', 'effects', 'war', 'not', 'war', 'viewer', 'left', 'own', 'judgment', 'issue', 'involved', 'war', 'are', 'reminded', 'war', 'hell', 'effect', 'combat', 'home.This', 'not', 'movie', 'simply', 'entertain', 'think', 'war', 'involved', 'perhaps', 'good', 'thing', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'take', 'sides', 'least', 'think', 'whole', 'issue', 'eyes', 'people', 'not', 'politicians']",N/A

The film showed them in Iraq relaxing, working, playing ball, etc before being told they have to go out on a mission two weeks before they are headed home.What was supposed to be a humanitarian mission turned into an ambush. Several soldiers wounded and killed. Two best friends separated forever. A female driver seriously wounded by an RPG. A doctor who sees far too many wounded military and civilian men, women and children.After they were attacked there are time skips taking each soldier back home. From there the soldiers each faced their own problems. Pain, alcohol and PTSD were all shown in this film. The way the VA helped or hindered each person was also shown.Jessica Biel portrayed a young single mother who was a coach at a high school before going to Iraq. She came home minus a hand and her struggles to overcome this loss was for me the forefront of the movie. However I would have liked her character to have been covered more though she did begin to pick up her life with the help of another coach.Whether or not this was supposed to be a true story or just a compilation of so many soldiers and the things they endured during and following their time at war remains to be seen.

Home of the Brave has good intentions and controversial subject matter, but it doesn't translate into an entertaining bit of cinema. Actors such as Samuel L. Jackson who usually churn out admirable performances are left with nothing to work with due to an obnoxious script and meager supporting characters; asinine dialogue carelessly peppers this defenseless cinematic convoy.Home of the Brave revolves around four soldiers who return home after a lengthy tour in Iraq. Will Marsh (Samuel L. Jackson) is a medical captain who is haunted by the lost lives he could not save. Vanessa Price (Jessica Biel) is a military cargo driver who loses her hand in a roadside explosion, and must readjust her life around her scathing injury. Tommy Yates (Brian Presley) is a specialist who deals with the torment of watching his childhood friend die in his arms from an Iraqi insurgent, and Jamal Aiken (Curtis Jackson) must cope with the accidental shooting of an Iraqi woman during the firefight that ensues after their convoy is ambushed. All four soldiers crumble under the hardships of adjusting to their old lifestyles and the dour impact the war has caused.Back in 1946 a little film called The Best Years of Our Lives garnered eight Academy Award nominations and seven wins, including Best Picture and Best Director. Its premise was heartwarming, the acting superb, and the tearjerker moments abundant. War torn veterans return home to discover a changed world that was unsympathetic and ignorant of the atrocities that took place during World War II. Home of the Brave is essentially a remake of that film, replacing WWII with the current Iraqi war. The exception of course, is that Home of the Brave fails to generate even the mildest drama and human emotion evoked from the 1946 classic.The film begins with predictable action reminiscent of the least impressive scenes from Black Hawk Down. Explosions and gunfire rattle the crumbling walls of the Iraqi city. But poor timing and ill-contrived slow motion shots clutter the already bland action. On top of that, the acting is abhorrent. While Samuel L. Jackson and Brian Presley make a decent attempt, they simply don't have much to work with. Curtis Jackson is horribly miscast; his character is pointless, nonsensical and nearly unintelligible. Biel also hands in an uninspiring role with ludicrous dialogue. Her rubbery hand prosthetics are continuously used in unintentionally hilarious scenes with laughable quips which further mock her handicap and the seriousness of losing limbs. Understanding and connection with the characters is never established and therefore the audience is left questioning how they should feel about the situations depicted.The major political themes in the film are also ambiguous and conflicting at times. Marsh defends his son's anti-war mindset even though he willingly participated and supported the war. Nearly the entire film shows the negative aspects of war and the uncompromising and depressing inner conflicts each character suffers with. And yet at the conclusion the mood abruptly circles toward support of the war and those who can no longer live without the pressing sense of camaraderie. Yates is so distraught and uncomfortable in adapting himself into his previous lifestyle that his only choice is to go back to the harsh conflicts in Iraq where he understands the soldiers and their need to fight for what they believe in. Why push the negative outlook, only to resolve with Yates' unexplainable drive to reenlist? Is the film defending the war or criticizing it? Apparently it doesn't know.While veterans and those familiar with the crippling aspects of combat may relate to the characters or situations, unfortunately, like the families of soldiers who stay behind and maintain their normal lives, general audiences won't find anything fulfilling or noteworthy about this movie. The pilfered plot from a far superior film, the absurd dialogue and the mediocre acting all contribute to a generic war film that will certainly be passed up as soon as its one week theatrical run deceases.- Mike Massie",2,Home of the Brave Movie Review,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,4198,"['Varied', 'messages', 'skewed', 'perspectives', 'abound', 'calamity', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'aftermath', 'victims', 'Home', 'Brave', 'good', 'intentions', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', ""n't"", 'translate', 'entertaining', 'bit', 'cinema', 'Actors', 'such', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'usually', 'churn', 'out', 'admirable', 'performances', 'are', 'left', 'nothing', 'work', 'due', 'obnoxious', 'script', 'meager', 'supporting', 'characters', 'asinine', 'dialogue', 'carelessly', 'defenseless', 'cinematic', 'convoy.Home', 'Brave', 'four', 'soldiers', 'who', 'return', 'home', 'lengthy', 'tour', 'Iraq', 'Will', 'Marsh', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'medical', 'captain', 'who', 'haunted', 'lost', 'could', 'not', 'save', 'Vanessa', 'Price', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'military', 'cargo', 'driver', 'who', 'hand', 'roadside', 'explosion', 'must', 'readjust', 'life', 'scathing', 'injury', 'Tommy', 'Yates', 'Brian', 'Presley', 'specialist', 'who', 'torment', 'watching', 'childhood', 'friend', 'die', 'arms', 'Iraqi', 'insurgent', 'Jamal', 'Aiken', 'Curtis', 'Jackson', 'must', 'cope', 'accidental', 'shooting', 'Iraqi', 'woman', 'firefight', 'convoy', 'ambushed', 'four', 'soldiers', 'crumble', 'hardships', 'adjusting', 'old', 'lifestyles', 'dour', 'impact', 'war', 'caused.Back', '1946', 'little', 'film', 'called', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'garnered', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'seven', 'wins', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'premise', 'was', 'heartwarming', 'acting', 'superb', 'tearjerker', 'moments', 'abundant', 'War', 'torn', 'veterans', 'return', 'home', 'discover', 'changed', 'world', 'was', 'unsympathetic', 'ignorant', 'atrocities', 'took', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Home', 'Brave', 'essentially', 'remake', 'film', 'replacing', 'WWII', 'current', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'exception', 'course', 'Home', 'Brave', 'generate', 'even', 'mildest', 'drama', 'human', 'emotion', 'evoked', '1946', 'classic.The', 'film', 'predictable', 'action', 'reminiscent', 'least', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Explosions', 'gunfire', 'rattle', 'crumbling', 'walls', 'Iraqi', 'city', 'poor', 'timing', 'ill-contrived', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'clutter', 'already', 'bland', 'action', 'top', 'acting', 'abhorrent', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Brian', 'Presley', 'make', 'decent', 'attempt', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'Curtis', 'Jackson', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'character', 'pointless', 'nonsensical', 'nearly', 'unintelligible', 'Biel', 'also', 'uninspiring', 'role', 'ludicrous', 'dialogue', 'rubbery', 'hand', 'prosthetics', 'are', 'continuously', 'used', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'laughable', 'quips', 'further', 'mock', 'handicap', 'seriousness', 'losing', 'limbs', 'Understanding', 'connection', 'characters', 'never', 'established', 'therefore', 'audience', 'left', 'questioning', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'situations', 'depicted.The', 'major', 'political', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'ambiguous', 'conflicting', 'times', 'Marsh', 'son', 'anti-war', 'mindset', 'even', 'willingly', 'participated', 'supported', 'war', 'Nearly', 'entire', 'film', 'negative', 'aspects', 'war', 'uncompromising', 'depressing', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'character', 'suffers', 'yet', 'conclusion', 'mood', 'abruptly', 'support', 'war', 'who', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'pressing', 'sense', 'camaraderie', 'Yates', 'so', 'distraught', 'uncomfortable', 'adapting', 'previous', 'lifestyle', 'only', 'choice', 'go', 'back', 'harsh', 'conflicts', 'Iraq', 'where', 'soldiers', 'need', 'fight', 'what', 'believe', 'Why', 'push', 'negative', 'outlook', 'only', 'resolve', 'Yates', 'unexplainable', 'drive', 'reenlist', 'film', 'defending', 'war', 'criticizing', 'Apparently', ""n't"", 'know.While', 'veterans', 'familiar', 'crippling', 'aspects', 'combat', 'may', 'relate', 'characters', 'situations', 'unfortunately', 'families', 'soldiers', 'who', 'stay', 'maintain', 'normal', 'lives', 'general', 'audiences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'fulfilling', 'noteworthy', 'movie', 'pilfered', 'plot', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'absurd', 'dialogue', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'contribute', 'generic', 'war', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'passed', 'up', 'as', 'soon', 'one', 'week', 'theatrical', 'run', 'deceases.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A
502630,ALG7QH2L5JL2L,B00000IBUW,"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[7, 10]","HotB is about three soldiers returning back from a tour in the ongoing war in Iraq and their adjustment issues. In the leads: Samuel Jackson as army surgeon Will Marsh, who feels guilty about his powerlessness to save people and about having become desensitized to their suffering; Jessica Biel as supply runt Vanessa Price, who got her right hand blown off by a roadside bomb, triggered by a kid with a cellphone; Brian Presley as soldier Tommy Yates, who lost his best friend just days before the scheduled return home as a result of the same ambush that occasioned Vanessa's injury.That ambush of what amounts to a humanitarian supply convoy is what loosely connects the characters; as Marsh is the first to tend to Vanessa and she briefly catches a glimpse of Yates as well, before everything goes to the dogs of war.The first segment, in Iraq, portrays some of the pressures of being a soldier, at all levels and in all functions; always having to be on guard, because anything else will kill you. The operative term is 'always'; unrelenting tension and stress, sometimes apparently qualifying as mild, but it never leaves you. For there are people around who hate you and will kill you whenever they can. There are also those who don't hate you and who may even be glad you're there and doing what you're doing, but it's in the nature of things that they will not go out with the same fervor and try to protect you; nor will they speak out in your defense with the same vigor as your opponents. This is, after all, the nature of these things.So, these three come home--plus a few other, more peripheral, figures--and, unlike is the case in other 'soldiers returning home' movies, nothing much actually happens. Which is part of the problem. For the normality of the life of those they are charged to defend--for whatever reason and motivation--is stifling with its normality and the complete lack of appreciation of their situation by those they return home to. So Marsh walks into a home where his son is disgusted not only at the war, but also at his father being a part of it; plus he has trouble sleeping, because he had gotten so used to not getting much sleep. Vanessa has to deal with being a solo divorced mum whose relationship with former boyfriend, Ray (James McDonald), went to the dogs some time ago, and who has to deal with being a one-handed cripple, who can't accept help even from friendly strangers like Cary (Jeffrey Nordling). Tommy has to deal with his father, who's a good guy but a bit dense and simple; a former buddy who's gone mentally AWOL for a number of reasons, and whose rage focuses on his former girlfriend who isn't interested in him anymore; as well as Tommy's own nagging guilt feelings at leaving his fellow soldiers behind to fight, while his own life's become 'safe'--in a manner of speaking.The problems at home would have appeared trivial in comparison to those these three faced while in the warzone. But they're not, because all problems and their magnitude are relative. Still, all of them have this notion that they don't fit, all for apparently different reasons--they all are the same.Irwin Winkler's direction and the script focuses on the ways in which it might be possible to overcome those problems; the manner in which those exposed to the brutalities of war may be redeemed and become, if not 'normal', but at least 'adapted' to life outside a warzone again. In the process the movie is careful to lay open the mood in the US with regards to the Iraq war; both sides of it, and with equal and evenhanded fairness. In the process it avoids making what amounts to a judgment, because that's not what what this movie is all about. It has much more the air of Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down, which also focused on soldiers, rather than politics; all the time acknowledging that there were political issues, but they were at another level and sometimes had to be put aside--with the notable exception of a certain, entirely justified, cynicism toward all politicians; as well as all those who basically don't end up having to put themselves in harm's way--except maybe in an election, which hardly compares.The solutions offered by the film are fairly simple, and they have to do with love, understanding, consideration and appreciation; not just as carried out by the professional machinery of  organized 'rehabilitation', but by the only ones who can do this in a sustained way: family, friends, neighbors and so on, in an ever-widening circle. And this isn't happening, by and large, though the movie suggests that it might. Sometimes. For the lucky ones. Because, as far as the fate of returned soldiers these days are concerned, all three main protagonists in HotB qualify as 'fortunate'. One would wish that it were more than a few.The editing of this film is interesting and fits with the need to follow the fates of three separate lives without too much discontinuity as the focus shifts from one person to another and another and back again. It's also difficult to tell the passage of time, but once one gets used to it, it flows easily enough. The moving shots in the warzone contrast with the many static ones 'at home'. Short scenes alternate with long ones in deft timing. The pacing is thoughtful and measured. At the end there are more questions unanswered than at the beginning. Which is as it should be.",5,One would wish more were so fortunate,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,5375,"['HotB', 'three', 'soldiers', 'returning', 'back', 'tour', 'ongoing', 'war', 'Iraq',
