E Jackson,"[1, 1]","As you probably know, this movie is about a father who is forced out of his car by a bad guy with a gun in his hand (that takes place out in the streets of Los Angeles).As the guy drives away in the fathers car, his son is still in there (in the back seat) so as the bad guy is driving away, the father is running forward down the street with a gun that happened to be with him, and shooting wildly in the small hope of hitting the bad guy (and having little consideration for all the innocent people who happen to be walking the streets) and getting him to stop the vehicle.Once the dust has settled, and all the shooting stops, we find out that the bad guy wants the father to pay him $100,000 by the following evening or else the son dies.  So what's a father to do?  How about finding a girl and going around robbing banks?  That's how he finds the money.The first half of the movie is violent and filled with swear words.  The movie is pretty entertaining overall for all you action fans out there, and the ending is somewhat surprising and emotional.  Though I don't quite understand at the very end how the helicopter happened to find the father so quickly.  I guess the helicopter just happened to be flying around, and it just so happens the guy they were looking for was nearby.

1013587,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000HDZKLO,Dorrie Wheeler,"[7, 9]","Tyrese Gibson and Meagan Goode heat up the big screen in the movie Waist Deep which arrives on DVD on October 10th. The movie arrived in theaters this summer and was well received. In the film, Tyrese stars as a O2 working class single father living in South Central Los Angeles. Early in the film he is the victim of a violent car jacking. Even worse his son is in the backseat of the car. A gun battle soon ensues and Tyrese finds himself on a mission to rescue his son from the hands of a dangerous street thug named Big Meat. On top of that the word on the street is that O2 has a huge stash of money hid away and Big Meat is holding his son for $100,000 cash and O2 has one day to deliver. On the street, O2 runs into a beautiful street hustler named Coco portrayed by actress Meagan Goode. After suspecting her of setting him up, he turns around and enlists her services to help him raise the ransom money. The two go on a crime spree like a urban Bonnie & Clyde hitting up hustlers and robbing bank safe deposit boxes, O2 even leaves a few bodies along the way. The city is also in the midst of a anti-gang violence protests.Waist Deep is a really good film that I enjoyed. It's a bit hard to believe that after such a big crime spree that O2 and his partner in crime manage to not have police heat hot on their trail. They make crime look so easy. Rapper The Game gives a convincing performance as gangster Big Meat and Larenz Tate also stars as O2's crooked cousin Lucky. In many ways it reminded me of a 2006 version of Set It Off. The crime duo get so ""waste deep"" in their crime syndicate there is no turning back. I must confess though that the end is a little bit predictable.Special FeaturesDeleted ScenesAnalysis of a SceneDrive By Film MakingMusic Video ""Bad Girl"" by Black Buddafly featuring Fabolous",5,Predictable But I Enjoyed It Start To Finish,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,1818,"['Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'Meagan', 'Goode', 'heat', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'Waist', 'Deep', 'DVD', 'October', '10th', 'movie', 'arrived', 'theaters', 'summer', 'was', 'well', 'received', 'film', 'Tyrese', 'stars', 'O2', 'working', 'class', 'single', 'father', 'living', 'South', 'Central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Early', 'film', 'victim', 'violent', 'car', 'jacking', 'Even', 'worse', 'son', 'backseat', 'car', 'gun', 'battle', 'soon', 'ensues', 'Tyrese', 'finds', 'mission', 'rescue', 'son', 'hands', 'dangerous', 'street', 'thug', 'named', 'Big', 'Meat', 'top', 'word', 'street', 'O2', 'huge', 'stash', 'money', 'hid', 'away', 'Big', 'Meat', 'holding', 'son', '100,000', 'cash', 'O2', 'one', 'day', 'deliver', 'street', 'O2', 'beautiful', 'street', 'hustler', 'named', 'Coco', 'portrayed', 'actress', 'Meagan', 'Goode', 'suspecting', 'setting', 'up', 'around', 'services', 'help', 'raise', 'ransom', 'money', 'two', 'go', 'crime', 'spree', 'urban', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'hitting', 'up', 'hustlers', 'robbing', 'bank', 'safe', 'deposit', 'boxes', 'O2', 'even', 'few', 'bodies', 'way', 'city', 'also', 'midst', 'anti-gang', 'violence', 'protests.Waist', 'Deep', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'hard', 'believe', 'big', 'crime', 'spree', 'O2', 'partner', 'crime', 'manage', 'not', 'have', 'police', 'heat', 'hot', 'trail', 'make', 'crime', 'look', 'easy', 'Game', 'convincing', 'performance', 'gangster', 'Big', 'Meat', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'also', 'O2', 'crooked', 'cousin', 'Lucky', 'many', 'ways', 'reminded', '2006', 'version', 'Set', 'Off', 'crime', 'duo', 'get', 'waste', 'deep', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'turning', 'back', 'must', 'confess', 'end', 'little', 'bit', 'predictable.Special', 'FeaturesDeleted', 'ScenesAnalysis', 'SceneDrive', 'Film', 'MakingMusic', 'Video', 'Bad', 'Girl', 'Black', 'Buddafly', 'featuring', 'Fabolous']",N/A

It's really good, much better than I thought it was going to be, and it actually kept my attention the whole time.Tyrese & Meagan are the dynamic duo here, and there's some scenes that may surprise you, but in a good way. Although u may think this storyline has been done already, well Tyrese & the rest of the cast (with the exception of Game, but I'll get to that later) manage to do it better than many other movies and add it's own twist.The only thing I think could've been done to make the movie even better is for somebody else to have played The Game's role. I like Game but his acting leaves much to be desired, he comes off way too hard to seem/sound gangsta, to the point where it's laughable. But then, he isn't the main character so his parts are tolerable being that they are so short and Tyrese's acting makes up for it all.Anyway, with that being said, Waist Deep is 4 stars out of 5, if you catch it on one day don't flip the channel just watch & you'll see what I mean.",4,The black Bonnie & Clyde,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,1087,"['write', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'thug', 'romance', 'movie', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'really', 'good', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'actually', 'kept', 'attention', 'whole', 'time.Tyrese', 'Meagan', 'are', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'here', 'scenes', 'may', 'surprise', 'good', 'way', 'u', 'may', 'think', 'storyline', 'been', 'done', 'already', 'well', 'Tyrese', 'rest', 'cast', 'exception', 'Game', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later', 'manage', 'do', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'add', 'own', 'twist.The', 'only', 'thing', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'somebody', 'else', 'have', 'played', 'Game', 'role', 'like', 'Game', 'acting', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'off', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'seem/sound', 'gangsta', 'point', 'where', 'laughable', 'then', ""n't"", 'main', 'character', 'parts', 'are', 'tolerable', 'being', 'are', 'so', 'short', 'Tyrese', 'acting', 'up', 'all.Anyway', 'being', 'said', 'Waist', 'Deep', '4', 'stars', '5', 'catch', 'one', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'flip', 'channel', 'just', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[6, 10]","Waist Deep was an OK piece of entertainment that got over on slick sets with high production values.The plot borrows liberally from many pictures before it. It plays very fast and loose with the audiences' sense of credibility; the hero pulls off so many seemingly impossible stunts here that there is a major ""oh suuuuure"" factor here. In fact, if I had to sum it up in a few words, it would be ""'Commando' featuring a black protagonist in a deep urban setting."" Yes, I'm serious. Think about it: Larger than life muscular ultraman is retired from from his former life of violence and black ops; he is pulled back into that life when his child is kidnapped. On the way, the first woman he bumps into is dragged along into his adventures and eventually becomes his ally and a member of his family. Sound familiar? So things go pretty much 'by the numbers' here. Anyone who has watched action/adventure movies for more than a couple of years could chart every plot point and development in the story arc at least 10 minutes before it happens on screen.The main attraction of this movie is the chemistry between Meagan Good and Tyrese Gibson. These two look good together and played off each other very well. Little else can be said about the other characters who are all one-dimensional. Most of the cast are highly buffed up in a  MTV kind of way, but the characters they play are as shallow as a baking pan, and it's hard to work up too much interest in them, since you know exactly what they are going to do and say. Still everyone ( even Hunter Hill, kidnap little boy) is able to really 'act' at a professional feature film level, as opposed to most glamor figures who just project an attitude. Compare most of the actors here to some 3rd rate fluff piece like ""Cradle 2 the Grave"", and the actors here come off much better than C2G's department store mannequins. I admired Larenz Tate in a way even though he was stuck with the 'weak' 2nd banana role as Gibson's cousin. He put a lot of juice into his character and it kind of worked. He reminded me somewhat of the way that Colin Farrell will use his eyes and mouth to simultaneously project weakness and bravado. The role pretty much sucked, but he did his best to make it succeed, and many actors would have been much worse in the role. Kimero Lee Simmons also did a cameo on this which was sort of odd but suitable for her at the same time.If your  a Tyrese Gibson fan then this film will interest you.""Waist Deep"" is only worth seeing for an evening of undemanding entertainment, but not much more.",2,I wonder why Hollywood even bother putting this film together.,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2558,"['Waist', 'Deep', 'was', 'OK', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'got', 'slick', 'sets', 'high', 'production', 'values.The', 'plot', 'borrows', 'liberally', 'many', 'pictures', 'very', 'fast', 'loose', 'audiences', 'sense', 'credibility', 'hero', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'stunts', 'here', 'major', 'oh', 'suuuuure', 'factor', 'here', 'fact', 'had', 'sum', 'up', 'few', 'words', 'would', 'be', ""'Commando"", 'featuring', 'black', 'protagonist', 'deep', 'urban', 'setting', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'serious', 'Think', 'Larger', 'life', 'muscular', 'ultraman', 'retired', 'former', 'life', 'violence', 'black', 'ops', 'pulled', 'back', 'life', 'when', 'child', 'kidnapped', 'way', 'first', 'woman', 'dragged', 'adventures', 'eventually', 'ally', 'member', 'family', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'So', 'things', 'go', 'pretty', 'much', 'numbers', 'here', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'action/adventure', 'movies', 'more', 'couple', 'years', 'could', 'chart', 'plot', 'point', 'development', 'story', 'arc', 'least', '10', 'minutes', 'screen.The', 'main', 'attraction', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'two', 'look', 'good', 'together', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'Little', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'Most', 'cast', 'are', 'highly', 'buffed', 'up', 'MTV', 'kind', 'way', 'characters', 'play', 'are', 'as', 'shallow', 'baking', 'pan', 'hard', 'work', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'interest', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'say', 'Still', 'everyone', 'even', 'Hunter', 'Hill', 'kidnap', 'little', 'boy', 'able', 'really', ""'act"", 'professional', 'feature', 'film', 'level', 'opposed', 'most', 'glamor', 'figures', 'who', 'just', 'project', 'attitude', 'Compare', 'most', 'actors', 'here', '3rd', 'rate', 'fluff', 'piece', 'Cradle', '2', 'Grave', 'actors', 'here', 'come', 'off', 'much', 'better', 'C2G', 'department', 'store', 'mannequins', 'admired', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'way', 'even', 'was', 'stuck', ""'weak"", '2nd', 'banana', 'role', 'Gibson', 'cousin', 'put', 'lot', 'juice', 'character', 'kind', 'worked', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'way', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'will', 'use', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'simultaneously', 'project', 'weakness', 'bravado', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'sucked', 'did', 'best', 'make', 'succeed', 'many', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'role', 'Kimero', 'Lee', 'Simmons', 'also', 'did', 'cameo', 'was', 'sort', 'odd', 'suitable', 'same', 'time.If', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'fan', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'interest', 'Waist', 'Deep', 'only', 'worth', 'seeing', 'evening', 'undemanding', 'entertainment', 'not', 'much', 'more']",N/A

I think Tyrese is a very underrated actor because he did a solid job in Baby Boy but never got the recognition he deserved. Tyrese is also lucky to get roles playing characters that are based on a California lifestyle, one he has seen before growing up in Watts. Though Waist Deep may seem like the same old same movie it's really not because it's full of talent with these young stars. I knew Tyrese would be ok and play his role perfect and of coarse Larenz Tate would play his character fine but I wasn't so sure about Game and Megan Good. Game was actually a pretty good villain but besides his scarred eye he doesn't stick out as much but he gets the job done. People were probably thinking his character would be over the top just because he is a famous rapper but the director didn't go that route. Megan Good was a nice support to Tyrese and she shows that she's an actress and not just eye candy.Yes the background story for Waist Deep may sound like you've heard it before. O2's (Tyrese Gibson) child gets abducted in a carjacking and he goes back to some old tricks to rescue him. What makes everything worse is that this man just got out of prison and he has two strikes and I don't think that he'll get away with murdering two men even though they just kidnapped his child. O2 is informed by his cousin Lucky (Larenz Tate) that the kidnapping was no coincidence. I had some trouble trusting his cousin though because the entire time he seemed like he was up to no good. Meat (Game) is basically running everything and used to be O2's partner in crime and heard that he stashed some money away before he left for prison and he is willing to trade the kid for the cash. Now O2 has to get $100,000 in a short amount of time or his son's life is over.There's a little bit of love between Tyrese and Megan's characters but you see it bloom into something bigger and anytime you have a movie where a man cares about his child's life and is willing to do anything to get him back is a must see. Every actor plays their character well and even takes it to a higher level and good job by Game for showing he has some talent without trying to takeover the entire movie.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[0, 0]","Waist Deep is the story of an ex-con who is trying to reform himself and make a better life for his son when circumstances force him to return to a life of crime. Tyrese Gibson stars as O2, a man who just got out of prison and is working at rebuilding his life. He's got a job as a security guard and takes care of his son. After picking his son up from school, O2 is distracted by a beautiful woman crossing the street. The next thing he knows he's being carjacked and the robbers are speeding away--unaware that his son is in the back seat. After enlisting the help of the woman who distracted him (Meagan Good in the role of ""hooker with a heart of gold""), O2 learns that his son is being held captive by a ruthless gang leader who wants $100,000 in exchange for the boy.Waist Deep was action packed and easy to follow. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it certainly wasn't the worst. I like the idea of a man who wants nothing more than to reform and show his son that a life of crime isn't his only option. The fact that this man is then forced to choose between leading by example and having someone to lead only makes the storyline more intriguing. I didn't know what to expect from this film, but I was entertained from start to finish.

He's got a job as a security guard and ends up having to go on an emergency run to pick up his son, who his no-good cousin didn't pick up from school.  While they're cruising down the street, this woman (Meagan) walks by trying to sell him a suit.  He's so distracted by her that he holds up traffic and ends up getting carjacked.  This turns out into a full force gun scene.  Crazy drama.  Without telling you much more of the story, he finds out that some cat is holding his son for ransom and he has to find a way to get the money for him.  This plot may seem like something you've heard before (and sorta reminds me of ""John Q."" without the ghetto, hustling, and drug dealers), but it's a very infectious story about the bond between a man and a woman, a man and his child, and how the police can mess somebody's mentality up so bad that even when they're innocent, they still know as a two-time felon/black man, they will never get away with telling the truth.If you like car chases, gun fights, loving, fatherhood, Meagan Good, The Game, Larenz Tate, and hilarious scenes in a very serious movie, this is for you!
