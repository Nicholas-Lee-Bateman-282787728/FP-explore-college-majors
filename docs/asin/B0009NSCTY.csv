908714,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0009NSCTY,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[31, 37]","Am I completely off my rocker when I make the observation that this series began with so much originality and intensity that one could not help but enjoy the sarcastic wit of Lenny Henry.  I loved the first season of Chef!, in fact, I thought that we were going to served a plate of classic Fawlty Towers with a side dish of Hell's Kitchen.  To my surprise, we were.  The first season demonstrated the comic genius of Henry and his ability to bring humor to the kitchen.  Sadly, unlike most other reviews of this series, it is lost after the first season.  The second season is watchable, while the final season is so glossy with obvious financing that you completely loose the characters, the structure of the original series, and everything that one could fall in love with.  I had to check the box to with the final season to ensure that I picked up the right series.  I nearly didn't recognize it.  I have always wondered why most of the BBC's television programs only last a couple of seasons, and Chef! explained it to me perfectly.  If this had continued further, we would have only deepened our loss for Henry's original obnoxious character and would have filed through nearly all of Britain's finest ""would-be"" actors to play the part of the ever-changing staff.  It would have been a debacle of grand proportions that would have left this series with a horrible hangover that could never have been remedied.I will state it one more time.  I loved the first season of this television series.  It was fresh, it was funny, and it had so much imagination that one could simply watch this first series over and over again while experiencing the same enjoyment they had the first time they viewed it.  I loved watching Henry argue with the staff, continually sleep on his days off, while still showing quite a human element to his wife Janice.  While they did argue throughout the program, I thought that it was nothing more than ""love"" spats between the two.  I felt, at least in the first season, that Gareth and Janice knew each other, accepted each other, and supported each other.  Similar to Fawlty Towers there was a bond between them that could not be broken.  In fact, they wanted to go in to business together to support each other.  This was the beginning of a great series.  While this drama happened outside in Gareth's personal life, it was what occurred inside the kitchen that provided most of, if nearly all, the laughter.  The connection with the staff, the education of the inexperienced and Henry's obsession with perfection created a very original program.  It was bright, it was intelligent, and it was ... to sound repetitive ... funny.  This was not a show that could succeed in America, and I think that is what I loved about it.  Then ... as if the forced that be were against this program ... the second and third season were created.The second season isn't bad.  It does falter a bit at times, perhaps giving us a subliminal indication of what is to come, but it still can stand on its own.  Gareth and Janice have their restaurant and are attempting to boost their business.  They argue about the finances and the staff, but the love is still there.  The staff has completely changed, but I was willing to ignore that for this time.  Everton was still present in the kitchen, so I felt a bit comfortable with the lack of familiar faces.  Henry is still obnoxious and himself.  He stays true to his character from the first season constantly yelling sarcasm to institute perfection from his staff.  The timing seems a bit off, but overall it feels like the original.  Henry is determined to be the greatest chef in England and takes his profession seriously, two qualities that you cannot fault a person for.  As we chuckle (not quite laugh) our way through this season, there is no way to prepare ourselves for the horrid disaster that we shall simply call, ""How Money Ruined Chef!"" also known as season three.The final season was a disaster.  The characters that we fell in love with are gone again, even Janice and Gareth are not the same.  We are introduced randomly to new characters that we are forced to laugh at and enjoy.  There is no indication of this at the end of the second season, so it felt like hitting a brick wall.  Lenny Henry is not funny.  I would go so far as to say that he completely lost his character from the first season.  He isn't angry, his sarcasm is very weak, and he does things in the kitchen that I would have never imagined him doing in the first season.  Gareth Blackstock lost his spine in this season.  While he has a personal crisis happen near the beginning of the season, that does not have to be the central focus of the show.  What made this show fantastic in the beginning was the kitchen, and somehow in this season we completely disregard the kitchen (the basis for the show) and bring the comedy out into the ""real world"".  For me, that didn't work.  It is obvious that this season had more money due to the crisp visuals and Americanized standards.  The music was a horrid choice and displaced any humor that tried to escape.  Food was not important any longer, and the structured themes that created this series were torn down with clich&eacute; lines and childish acting.  This final season ruined this series for me because it wouldn't stay true to itself.Overall, thanks to the final season, this was a mediocre television series.  Lenny Henry is funny, but as the monetary dollars rose, his sense of humor seemed to fall.  What began as lyrical humor eventually devolved into physical humor that wasn't funny.  The changing of the kitchen staff became annoying, Everton's character never seemed to grow with time, while it only became obvious that Gareth and Janice were not cut out to run a restaurant.  Janice became bitter, which wasn't funny, while Gareth threw his original food obsession out the window in lieu of personal issues.  This series sank and never had the opportunity to resurface.  If you must watch Chef! stick to the first season, you will be pleasantly surprised, while if you continue you may find yourself pleasantly angry by the results.  Don't say I didn't warn you!Grade: *** out of *****",3,Serious Profession?,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,6201,"['Am', 'completely', 'rocker', 'when', 'make', 'observation', 'series', 'began', 'so',

908722,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0009NSCTY,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[1, 1]","This is a masterful comedy, especially the first two seasons.  It's probably the only comedy to really ever present a chef as they really are (at least the good ones).  The culinary arts are just like any other art forms, and the better the chefs are, the more difficult they can be.  It's like working for a great filmmaker, great writer, etc., etc..  Lenny Henry is brilliant as Gareth, the fantastic, yet incredibly tempremental chef.  The writing here is first rate, and the best thing about this series is that the lead character is not likeable, yet you enjoy watching him anyway.  This is actually a very realistic depiction of what an actual chef would go through.  Gareth hardly sleeps, he has little or no social life, he insults his customers as well as his staff, but he knows food, and he's in his kitchen 12-16 hours a day.  You can constrast this series with the godawful American sitcom Freddie (with Freddie Prinze, Jr.).  He played a chef as well, but in the few episodes that actually made it to air, all he ever did was go to bars and hit on women with his business partner Brian Austin-Green, and spent most of his time in his apartment with his wise cracking grandma and bratty sister.  The writers of Freddie didn't do an ounce of research, and it shows.  In Chef, they actually did research.  It's nice to see a realistic depiction of a chef, and it's still damn funny.  The first two seasons are the best in my opinion.  The third one isn't as bad, but the first two had better writing, and were shot on film.  The third one was shot on video, and Gareth was a little too nice to others in it, like they tried to make the character likeable, which doesn't work.

908723,A1D7VWS3DWS7X8,B0009NSCTY,Joseph Siegler,"[122, 127]","Let me start off by saying that I'm a big fan of Chef.  I run a Chef fan website, and have done so since August of 1996, before the third series of the show was aired.  I know these episodes like the back of my hand.  This show is utter brilliance.  There's little weakness here.  If that's the case, then why didn't I give this 5 stars?The reason for that is that this DVD set misses a huge opportunity, and that's to be an archive of Chef! material, and ultimately that's a bit of a letdown.  This is a 3 DVD set that does include all the episodes of Chef.  However, there's not much else.  Discs 1 and 2 have nothing more than the episodes themselves.  Disc 3 has only a few extras on it, and they are:1) A text based description of some of the careers of the three lead actors (Lenny Henry, Caroline Lee Johnson, & Roger Griffiths).2) An interview with Lenny Henry that aired two weeks before the premiere of the first series of Chef! (3:45)3) An interview with Caroline Lee Johnson that aired halfway through the first series of Chef! (8:36)4) A making of/Interview with Lenny Henry about Series 3 of Chef! (7:24)5) A bunch of trailers for other British Comedy series on DVD.That's it.  No text commentaries, no audio commentaries that are so prevelant these days on DVD sets.  I would have loved to have heard Lenny Henry, Roger Griffiths, or any of the other actors talking about the episodes.  Commentaries are a great way to get additional value out of a set, and much more enjoyment for fans of the series, like I am.  You know there has to be more material lying around the vaults than that.  Lenny could have done a commentary for each episode, or saving that at least a couple.  The fact that the set is barebones really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Additionally, there is an error in the packaging.  If you look at the external box for the set which has all three DVD's in one package, the list of episodes for Series 1 is missing two.  Some promotional materials claim there are only 18 episodes in this set (including Amazon's own incorrect listing information at the time of launch of this set).  However, I've looked - there are definitely all 20 episodes of Chef! in this set.  Disc 1 does indeed have all 6 episodes plus the Christmas Special.But enough about the DVD's themselves.  This show is one of funniest British comedies I've ever seen.Chef! is a show about a cook named Gareth Blackstock (Lenny Henry) who is the head chef at a restaurant in England the Chateau Anglais. Gareth (usually just called Chef on the show) is a very good, extremely good cook, and is not afraid to show it. He is married to a woman, Janice Blackstock, and together, the two of them run the restuarant (in the first two series - In Series 3, the arrangement is a bit different).  The show is based around their life running the resturant, and Gareth's rather overzealous and very loud personnel management of the people in his kitchen. Gareth, while the best cook in England (or so the show says, anyway), is an extremely high strung person, and loses his temper constantly. It's very funny when he does, and they actually manage to convey very strong emotions while staying away from actual swearing.  Part of the thrust of the comedy here is that Gareth is so sure of himself, and blunders into situations and has to get himself out of them.That's the best way I can think of to describe the show.  Gareth doing his rants reminds me a lot of Basil Fawlty and his rants.  There's a certain controlled ""out of controlness"" to the comedy here that appeals to me.  This show is incredibly funny, if you like British Comedy at all, you'll really enjoy this.  Even if you aren't a big britcom fan, I urge you to check it out.  I think you'll like it.Some of my favorite episodes are ""The Big Cheese"" (Favorite overall), England Expects, & Paris? Jamaica?.  Series III takes a hit from some fans, but that's because it's not exactly like the first two.  In Series 3, a bit more attention was paid to character interaction than it was in the first two series.  It has a different feel, but I think it's stronger for that.STILTON!",4,One of the funniest shows around.

I use to catch it on my local PBS station and couldn't get enough of the ill-tempered, titled character. ""Chef!"" was a very funny British sitcom, which neatly observed the early 1990's arrival of the Superstar 'Diva' Chefs, who are very common today (just take a gander at cable's ""Food Network""). In this show, we are introduced to hard working, cooking genuis, Gareth Blackstock (a brilliantly funny, Lenny Henry) who imperiously presides over the kitchen of the Oxfordshire, country restaurant 'La Chateau Anglais'. Gareth might be well known for the finest in French cuisine, but he also has a reputation for his rudeness and volcanic temper, which can explode at any moment, resulting in long tirades of verbal abuse.(Ex.""You are a pea-brained, prat-faced, pompous, pillock-headed cretin. If you took an intensive course of intelligence injections and studied till you drop, then one day you might make it to moron third class failed!"") The crux of the show is that initially nothing matters to Gareth, but creating the very best in cooking. Everything else gets second place in his life.  This is all to the detriment and consternation of his smart, but long suffering/romance starved wife, Janice (an excellent, Caroline Lee Johnson), his abused cooking staff, the service staff, the restaurant's owners and even the dining clientele. During the course of three series, we watch how Gareth's obsessiveness and ego eventually wrecks complete havoc on his marriage and private life. But not all is so dark. The dialogue & plot situations are very funny. (A good example includes an episode that involves a search for English wine in Paris for a cooking contest. It was hilarious to watch the snooty, French liquor store owners laugh in Gareth's face!) Over the course of the series, Gareth's character is slowly softened a bit and the ever changing kitchen staff is eventually given a more prominent comedic role in the show. This includes the much put-upon, Everton (Roger Griffiths), the alcoholic, old hand, Gustave (Ian McNeice, Jeff Nutall), the ditzy, love lorn American, Savannah (Lorelei King) and the owner's spoiled daughter, Renee (Sophee Walker). The show has now been released to DVD in either individual discs or in the box set, ""Chef!-The Complete Collection (Series 1-3)"". I recommend the box set, because it gives you a better ideal of the evolution of the show and it's characters. Extras include short, but interesting interviews with the show's stars.

908734,A2JHYW5V7UFIQ2,B0009NSCTY,"R. C. Walker ""catu11us""","[2, 2]","Our local PBS station at one time offered a marvelous selection of Britcoms on Saturday night.  Many of these gloriously funny comedies lit up the small screen like brilliant fireflies that lived only 3 or 4 of the short British seasons and (alas) vanished - Thin Blue Line, Murder Most Horrid, and others - and of course Chef!.Alas, now the station seems dedicated to the more heavy hitters: Waiting For God, Keeping Up Appearances, As Time Go By, what have you.  These are worthy entries all, that lasted several seasons.  They're long enough to bear repetition, although I'm not sure endless repetition works all that well.  One really wishes for some variation . . . like Chef!.Britcoms, unlike a majority of Americoms, have interesting settings.  The American standard seems to be somebody's house.  Interesting comedies can be done in somebody's house; George and Gracie did it - but a house is a house is a house and it gets boring.  Some Americoms have been done in interesting settings, such as a radio station, and that helps.  But Britcoms are often more creative in the area of setting.  Chef! is set in the kitchen of a gourmet restaurant.  OK, there are some scenes in somebody's house, but it's still a great Britcom.Lenny Henry stars in Chef! as a very talented chef.  Like many stars of sitcoms, he began his career as a standup comedian.  His success is predicated on not stooping to the low-class sort of audience that believes swearing is funny and more swearing is more funny.  Indeed, he has developed a style of invective that would send the swearing-is-funny types scuttling to the dictionary - if they knew what one was.The basic plot of Chef! is simple enough.  Henry is Gareth Blackstock, a chef whose inflated opinion of himself is probably justified.  The 2-star restaurant where he works, despite its success, goes into receivership.  You know the sort of restaurant I mean - the kind that serves you a couple of tablespoons of really great ours d'oeuvres, and charges you a small fortune for the privilege of having to rush home and make a couple of sandwiches to fill up on.With great difficulty he and his wife Janice buy the restaurant.  Most of the action takes place in the kitchen and other locations in the restaurant.  Each episode is complete in itself, but there is an ongoing plot involving the fate of the restaurant and the relationship of Gareth and Janice (played with wit and charm by Caroline Lee Johnson).  Also in the cast is Roger Griffiths, who plays Everton, a fine contrast to the urbane Blackstocks.  These are the only members of the cast you will see for any longer than 1 season - although another character (Gustave LaRoche) appears in seasons 2 and 3, he is played by the estimable Ian Niece in Season 2 and by Jeff Nuttall in Season 3.On the whole, Chef! is a very funny series.  In the last season, 3, things take a more serious turn.  Seasons 1 and 2 appeared in 1993 and 1994, while season 3 appeared in 1996.  The 1995 hiatus might seem to indicate a problem, and in fact no more episodes appeared after 1996.  It's fair to state, however, that the ongoing plot of Season 3 is at least resolved at the end.I believe it's fair to observe that there is a very serious problem with this program.  Save for the 3 main characters, the entire cast changes each season.  One barely gets used to characters, and develops empathy for them, than they vanish and are replaced by strange faces.  It doesn't seem reasonable to expect audience loyalty to a show when this sort of thing is going on.The DVD set is a set of the 3 seasons as they were originally put out, in normal-sized cases.  The thinner cases now so often used in sets would have been much better.Alas, there are no subtitles.  The English seem to feel that they don't owe the viewer any help in understanding what's being said - even down to the most outrageous Yorkshire or Welsh accents.  This is the same country that, for years, didn't feel it necessary to label their stamps as to the country of origin.  (Then, of course, there was the pre-WWI Times headline - I kid you not - ""Storm in Channel, Continent cut off!"".)  Such hubris has only been partially punished by their having to endure a separate Scottish Parliament.There are some special features on the 3rd DVD in the set.  They're OK, but a little on the thin side: primarily interviews with the 2 main principals and a segment of a British food show profiling Chef!.  These range (timewise) from brief to extremely brief - the interview of Henry last little more than 3 minutes!The whiffy title music wears out its welcome by the 2nd episode, becomes even more obnoxious by the 3rd - and by the 4th you will be clicking the fast-forward button before the ""ooooo"" begins, with trembling hands and a hymn of thanks to the god of remotes.Nevertheless, it's

Lenny Henery is simply brilliant as temperamental chef Gareth Blackstock, and Caroline Lee Johnson superb as his wife Janice. Sadly, the DVD set is very much lacking in extras -- all we get are a couple little things. It would have been nice to have gotten more. But the important this is that this series is finally available.The first disk, series 1, is by far the best of the lot. There are some absolutely classic Chef! moments in these episodes, and the first few are probably the best of the whole series. The second series on disk 2 is almost as good, and there are some great moments and episodes here, too.Sadly, series three isn't very good at all. Blackstock is less [...] and more buffoon in series 3, and Caroline Lee Johnson isn't seen much. The chemistry between Gareth and Janice is a major driving force of the first two series, and without it series three falls flat. The stories in series three are more removed from the kitchen and focus more on outside events and characters, which also takes a lot of the wind out of the show. Also, most of the new characters in series three just aren't very good -- I truly hate the characters of Savanah and the new manager. The acting seems VERY forced, as are the laughs -- they don't come as naturally here as they do in series 1 and 2. I will likely not watch the third DVD much, while the first two get a real workout. But all complaining aside, I'm thrilled to finally get this show on DVD.

908739,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B0009NSCTY,Twiddles42,"[7, 7]","The previous reviewer mentioned the gaffe on the packaging.  I had seen the 528 minute running time, did some calculations (averaged at 28 mins per episode) and the tally DOES go up to the full collection's content, so no worries on this!)As for extras, these had also been given detailing by another person.  Given these are NTSC versions of the PAL releases only, the included extras isn't bad - it's quite nice, actually.  Many American shows (and many British ones) lack interviews and such altogether, but having Chef!'s ""big three"" actors make commentaries for certain episodes would be the only change I'd ask for.I ran out the day the VHS tapes for series 1 came out.  A friend introduced me to the series and I instantly fell in love with it.A primer for the show:Series 1 sets up Gareth Blackstock's attempt to buy the Chateau he cooks for.  The 6 episodes, while following a base formula structure, cover so many concepts that it's too easy to forget that it's formulaic.  And, indeed, there are some curveballs thrown you'd never expect - most of which involve Everton, the clutzy beginner.  This series is also somewhat sequential; to get full benefit from later episodes, watching the previous ones will allow you to spot the refences.Series 1's highlights are ""Beyond the Pass"", in which Gareth berates a couple of hapless customers while Everton learns how to make soup...  oh, there's a great anti-banking tirade in this one too.  A must-see for that alone!! :-)  ""Subject to Contract"" features some great interplay against journalists.  ""The Big Cheese"" features a famous chef (played by a real chef of the time) making a visit, with Everton putting a special ingredient into one of Gareth's important dishes...  ""Fame is the Spur"", my favorite, has a camera crew making a documentary of what goes on in Gareth's kitchen.  Everton also hatches up a new way to serve crayfish...All the episodes are fun, but definitely watch them in order.Series 2, also given the same level of care in its production, drops the formula.  This is a mixed bag.  This series doesn't really become engaging until ""Masterchef"", which is a TERRIFIC plot for Everton, who more than proves his mettle.  Every episode after this keeps the same level of entertainment, topping off with the finale where we get to learn a new racial epithet that'll leave you confused AND laughing off your seat at the same time; it's most bizarre.  Of course, ""A Diploma of Misery"" sets the stage for the final series...Series 3 sees big changes.  Gone is the classical music, the show being filmed (it's now taped), and Everton's growth as a character.  On the plus side, we DO see a big interpersonal between Gareth and his wife (Janice) and there are some great character moments. But the level of comedy is nowhere near as brisk, and even Gareth's icy comments are nowhere near as sharp.  Series 3 seems ""Americanized"", not just for the inclusion of an American (and a change in the actor playing Gustav for no reason) but for the type of humor used.  While ""Chef!"" has always been a bit ribald, it was still witty.  Series 3 starts using more physical comedy rather than wit.  Of course, if you dig looking at naked men, then this series might have a surprise or two in store...  But the downsides to this series aside, there ARE some good comedic bits and the drama of Gareth's relationship and surrounding events still makes it worthy.Perhaps it's a shame no 4th series was commissioned.  :-(Definitely a must-buy for fans.  I was a grin-on-legs when I saw it.",5,Kudos to the previous reviewer!,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,3541,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'gaffe', 'packaging', 'had', 'seen', '528', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'did', 'calculations', 'averaged', '28', 'mins', 'episode', 'tally', 'DOES', 'go', 'up', 'full', 'collection', 'content', 'worries', 'extras', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'given', 'detailing', 'person', 'Given', 'are', 'NTSC', 'versions', 'PAL', 'only', 'included', 'extras', ""n't"", 'bad', 'quite', 'nice', 'actually', 'Many', 'American', 'shows', 'many', 'British', 'ones', 'lack', 'interviews', 'such', 'altogether', 'having', 'Chef', 'big', 'three', 'actors', 'make', 'commentaries', 'certain', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'change', ""'d"", 'ask', 'for.I', 'ran', 'out', 'day', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'series', '1', 'came', 'out', 'friend', 'introduced', 'series', 'instantly', 'fell', 'love', 'it.A', 'primer', 'show', '1', 'sets', 'up', 'Gareth', 'Blackstock', 'attempt', 'buy', 'Chateau', '6', 'episodes', 'following', 'base', 'formula', 'structure', 'cover', 'so', 'many', 'concepts', 'too', 'easy', 'forget', 'formulaic', 'indeed', 'are', 'curveballs', ""'d"", 'never', 'expect', 'most', 'involve', 'Everton', 'clutzy', 'beginner', 'series', 'also', 'somewhat', 'sequential', 'get', 'full', 'benefit', 'later', 'episodes', 'watching', 'previous', 'ones', 'will', 'allow', 'spot', 'refences.Series', '1', 'highlights', 'are', 'Pass', 'Gareth', 'couple', 'hapless', 'customers', 'Everton', 'how', 'make', 'soup', 'oh', 'great', 'anti-banking', 'tirade', 'one', 'too', 'must-see', 'alone', 'Subject', 'Contract', 'great', 'interplay', 'journalists', 'Big', 'Cheese', 'famous', 'chef', 'played', 'real', 'chef', 'time', 'making', 'visit', 'Everton', 'putting', 'special', 'ingredient', 'one', 'Gareth', 'important', 'dishes', 'Fame', 'Spur', 'favorite', 'camera', 'crew', 'making', 'documentary', 'what', 'Gareth', 'kitchen', 'Everton', 'also', 'up', 'new', 'way', 'serve', 'crayfish', 'episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'definitely', 'watch', 'order.Series', '2', 'also', 'given', 'same', 'level', 'care', 'production', 'formula', 'mixed', 'bag', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'become', 'engaging', 'Masterchef', 'TERRIFIC', 'plot', 'Everton', 'who', 'more', 'mettle', 'episode', 'same', 'level', 'entertainment', 'topping', 'off', 'finale', 'where', 'get', 'learn', 'new', 'racial', 'epithet', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'confused', 'laughing', 'off', 'seat', 'same', 'time', 'most', 'bizarre', 'course', 'Diploma', 'Misery', 'stage', 'final', 'series', 'Series', '3', 'big', 'changes', 'Gone', 'classical', 'music', 'show', 'being', 'filmed', 'now', 'taped', 'Everton', 'growth', 'character', 'plus', 'side', 'DO', 'see', 'big', 'interpersonal', 'Gareth', 'wife', 'Janice', 'are', 'great', 'character', 'moments', 'level', 'comedy', 'nowhere', 'near', 'brisk', 'even', 'Gareth', 'icy', 'comments', 'are', 'nowhere', 'sharp', '3', 'Americanized', 'not', 'just', 'inclusion', 'American', 'change', 'actor', 'playing', 'Gustav', 'reason', 'type', 'humor', 'used', 'Chef', 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'ribald', 'was', 'still', 'witty', '3', 'starts', 'using', 'more', 'physical', 'comedy', 'rather', 'wit', 'course', 'dig', 'looking', 'naked', 'men', 'then', 'series', 'might', 'have', 'surprise', 'two', 'store', 'downsides', 'series', 'aside', 'ARE', 'good', 'comedic', 'bits', 'drama', 'Gareth', 'relationship', 'surrounding', 'events', 'still', 'shame', '4th', 'series', 'was', 'commissioned', 'Definitely', 'must-buy', 'fans', 'was', 'grin-on-legs', 'when', 'saw']",Chef!: The Complete Collection - Series 1-3
