He gets her a job at the Spitfire Grill, run by old Hannah (Ellen Burstyn), who is crotchety the way old people with aches and pains get, but has a good heart.Before Percy gets used to cooking, Hannah breaks her leg falling off a stool she was standing on, and Percy is in charge of the entire Grill operation. Fortunately, young Shelby (Marcia Gay Harden), Hannah's nephew Nahum's (Will Patton) wife, steps in to help.But Nahum simply cannot trust Percy, which leads to all sorts of complications. The story unfolds in such a perfect rhythm, that there's very little I can tell you without ruining it.I can tell you about the Contest. Hannah put a ""for sale"" sign on the Grill many years ago, and Nahum has been trying to sell it for her. But there have been no buyers, and Hannah has about given up. Then through Shelby, Percy suggests they could do like some people who were trying to unload a hotel in the southern part of the state did: hold an essay contest with a $100 entry fee. Every entry would include a letter expressing why they want the grill. Percy enlists her friends in the call center at the prison to help spread the word, and the contest is a success.But that's nowhere near the end of the story.

417189,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6304369336,Bobby Underwood,"[50, 53]","This very touching and rewarding film was brought to prominence thanks in large part to Robert Redford's Sundance Film Festival. It is a slow and gentle film which is true to life and makes us actually feel its pain. Often described as a small film, it is rather a very large film about the small things in life. The small town of Gilead, Maine is the setting for this tender drama you will never forget once you have seen it.Alison Elliot gives a quiet yet unforgettable performance as Percy Talbot, a young girl fresh from prison and trying to start her life over. One of the most touching moments in the film comes shortly after Percy reveals the reason she had been incarcerated, with the words: ""I thought maybe, in some place small...."" It is quiet and heartbreaking, like the entire film.The day to day life of a small town and its people is perfectly captured as Percy comes to work for Hannah (Ellen Burstyn) at The Spitfire Grill. Hannah is a woman who knows about pain and gives Percy a chance. Marcia Gay Harden gives a fine performance as a shy and sweet soul who befriends Percy. Her husband uses her for a doorstop and hates Percy for being her friend and encouraging her to be herself. It is a hatred which will bring about tragedy.Many lives are touched in this small town by Percy, who has seemingly found her home at The Spitfire Grill in Gilead, Maine. Percy slowly becomes part of Hannah's life as she leaves food out back of the Grill at Hannah's request that is mysteriously gone the next morning. But there is always an underlying sadness to Percy's past which prevents any kind of permanence. Her deep sadness extends to a young man who wants a life that Percy can not give.This film reminds us in a sad and deeply moving way that life does not always give us the chance to start over. But there is also redemption and the message that what we do in our lives does affect others and can even change the way they think.Alison Elliot is magnificent here, giving a Kevin Spacey like performance of so much going on just beneath the surface. A beautiful score from James Horner a year before Titanic matches perfectly the quiet beauty of the story. The supporting cast is equally good in this wonderful and moving film you will remember for a long, long time.....",5,A Heartbreaking Look at Pain,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,2284,"['very', 'touching', 'rewarding', 'film', 'was', 'brought', 'prominence', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'slow', 'gentle', 'film', 'true', 'life', 'actually', 'feel', 'pain', 'Often', 'described', 'small', 'film', 'rather', 'very', 'large', 'film', 'small', 'things', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'Gilead', 'Maine', 'setting', 'tender', 'drama', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'once', 'have', 'seen', 'it.Alison', 'Elliot', 'quiet', 'yet', 'unforgettable', 'performance', 'Percy', 'Talbot', 'young', 'girl', 'fresh', 'prison', 'trying', 'start', 'life', 'One', 'most', 'touching', 'moments', 'film', 'shortly', 'Percy', 'reason', 'had', 'been', 'incarcerated', 'words', 'thought', 'maybe', 'place', 'small', 'quiet', 'heartbreaking', 'entire', 'film.The', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'people', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'Percy', 'work', 'Hannah', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Spitfire', 'Grill', 'Hannah', 'woman', 'who', 'pain', 'Percy', 'chance', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'fine', 'performance', 'shy', 'sweet', 'soul', 'who', 'Percy', 'husband', 'doorstop', 'Percy', 'being', 'friend', 'encouraging', 'be', 'hatred', 'will', 'bring', 'about', 'tragedy.Many', 'lives', 'are', 'touched', 'small', 'town', 'Percy', 'who', 'seemingly', 'found', 'home', 'Spitfire', 'Grill', 'Gilead', 'Maine', 'Percy', 'slowly', 'part', 'Hannah', 'life', 'food', 'out', 'back', 'Grill', 'Hannah', 'request', 'mysteriously', 'gone', 'next', 'morning', 'always', 'underlying', 'sadness', 'Percy', 'past', 'kind', 'permanence', 'deep', 'sadness', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'Percy', 'can', 'not', 'give.This', 'film', 'reminds', 'sad', 'deeply', 'moving', 'way', 'life', 'not', 'always', 'give', 'chance', 'start', 'also', 'redemption', 'message', 'what', 'do', 'lives', 'affect', 'others', 'can', 'even', 'change', 'way', 'think.Alison', 'Elliot', 'magnificent', 'here', 'giving', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'performance', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'just', 'surface', 'beautiful', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'year', 'Titanic', 'matches', 'perfectly', 'quiet', 'beauty', 'story', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'good', 'wonderful', 'moving', 'film', 'will', 'remember', 'long', 'long', 'time', '..']",N/A

She made Percy human and believable.  Percy was not perfect but she has a heart of gold.  The hope was not dead even in prison.  Like Millie Theal, Percy is doomed.  But she loved.

A young girl, just released from prison, decides to settle down in the quiet New England village of Gillead.  The residents initially are downright unfriendly to her, and their transformation is predictable, but achieved in an unpredictable and pleasing way.  The Spitfire Grill is like that:  certain outcomes are required in this kind of movie, but the way the story gets to them is surprising and satisfying.A great cast of characters (and actors) surround Alison Elliott as the young ex-con Percy.  But Elliott is the key:  she is very, very good in this movie, and her character is one you'll remember for quite a while.I don't in general care for tear-jerker movies like the Spitfire Grill, but the tragedies and joys presented here are believable and not overdone.

The problem is that her magic cannot work for her. She can't heal herself. And she is the most injured person she knows. Of course, there are those skeptics who are not healed because they refuse to accept her gift. In this case, it is Nahum (played marvelously by Will Patten) who is the heavy. The result is inevitable as the circle closes and Percy's do-gooding manages to heal everybody, but herself. A great movie. A tear jerker that really gives you something to cry about.

A young woman who has lost her way in life due to a huge amount of trauma tries to find a place of beauty and a way to heal. She does so for the short time she resides in the beautiful mountains of a little township. She comes to find realness, support and true friends from two women in the town and their intimacy takes place in the little restaurant called the Spitfire Grill. It has a warmth and a comfort to it. The nature provides the background to letting go of Percy's emotions. She has been in jail for manslaughter. She is finally making a life for herself. She finds a man that lives as a loner in the forest and aligns herself with him. He may represent the quiet spirit she sees in herself. Her connection with him helps her to find a kindred safty in the world. I could relate with her so much and crave that peace and anonimity that she found in that mountainside and the safty of the big giant who was silent except for a gentleness that flowed from their connection. She found hope and motivation to create and help others and impacted a whole town before her leaving. I would love to be in a place like this with the beauty, safty and healing. The restaurant with its regulars and the aroma of good food gives a feeling of safe and comfort. The mountains were so beautiful and her aloneness allowed the spirit of healing to come forth.

Slowly paced and gently felt, viewed more with the soul than the eyes.It concerns a young woman named Percy who wishes to reconcile her unsavory past in the small town of Giliad Maine but she is haunted by the very past that she wishes to overcome.Many people would like a chance to start over but life does not always afford then that opportunity.Nonetheless, we all still do affect others in ways that are not always seen. And therein lies the tale of redemption. A redemption that can sometimes be late in coming.Yet there is still hope in the unfairness all around us. And compassion to be found.Don't expect a Hollywood ending here. But who really wants one in this context?It's been said that Hollywood films depict life as we would like to see it.But independent films depict life as it is.Small towns are hesitant enough about welcoming newcomers, yet Percy's arrival and her spirit is sensed as being something altogether different and the town unexpectedly finds itself changed forever.The inviting musical score by James Horner renders a sweet ambiance, consoling with a subdued drifty quality that lulls the heart in its wake.This is an exceptionally beautiful American film about a troubled young woman's search for a place she can finally call home.*** ""There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole.""(Jeremiah 8:22)",5,Beautiful,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,1461,"['Spitfire', 'Grill', '1996', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Alison', 'ElliotRated', 'PG13.This', 'very', 'touching', 'bittersweet', 'independent', 'film', 'Slowly', 'paced', 'gently', 'felt', 'viewed', 'more', 'soul', 'eyes.It', 'concerns', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Percy', 'who', 'reconcile', 'unsavory', 'past', 'small', 'town', 'Giliad', 'Maine', 'haunted', 'very', 'past', 'overcome.Many', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'chance', 'start', 'life', 'not', 'always', 'afford', 'then', 'opportunity.Nonetheless', 'still', 'do', 'affect', 'others', 'ways', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'seen', 'therein', 'tale', 'redemption', 'redemption', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'late', 'coming.Yet', 'still', 'hope', 'unfairness', 'compassion', 'be', 'found.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'here', 'who', 'really', 'one', 'context', 'been', 'said', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'depict', 'life', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'it.But', 'independent', 'films', 'depict', 'life', 'is.Small', 'towns', 'are', 'hesitant', 'enough', 'welcoming', 'newcomers', 'Percy', 'arrival', 'spirit', 'sensed', 'being', 'something', 'altogether', 'different', 'town', 'unexpectedly', 'changed', 'forever.The', 'inviting', 'musical', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'sweet', 'ambiance', 'consoling', 'subdued', 'drifty', 'quality', 'heart', 'wake.This', 'exceptionally', 'beautiful', 'American', 'film', 'troubled', 'young', 'woman', 'search', 'place', 'can', 'finally', 'call', 'home', '***', 'balm', 'Gilead', 'make', 'wounded', 'whole', 'Jeremiah', '8:22']",N/A

417229,A1C80B497LCYKA,6304369336,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[4, 6]","This is a good, top-shelf, Hallmark-style story about a small town in Maine named Gilead that has to overcome its suspicions about an ex-con named Percy (played wonderfully by Alison Elliott) as she tries to make a new life there. Working at the Spitfire Grill, she impacts the lives of its owner - crusty but soft-hearted Hannah (also played wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) - fellow waitress Shelby (Marcia Gay Harden), boyfriend Joe (Kieran Mulroney) and the mysterious and elusive woodsman Johnny B. (John M. Jackson). Not to be touched by Percy's honesty and helpful nature is hard-hearted Nahum (Will Patton), Shelby's husband, who only believes the worst about Percy, and who's meddling eventually sets in motion a chain of events that leads to the film's tragic conclusion.But it doesn't have to be that way. There is absolutely no dramatic purpose behind the ending of this movie. Writer-director Lee David Zlotoff could have accomplished everything he wanted (the redemption of Nahum, the revelation of Johnny B., the coming together of the town), plus given the audience what it wanted (the eventual happiness of Percy). But he chose not to, and instead, gave us a contrived, melodramatic, purposeless ending that, frankly, left me empty. Even the appearance at the end of a new owner for the Spitfire Grill that was a lot like Percy didn't take the place of what we really wanted: Percy owning the Grill, happily married to either Joe or Johnny B.Now, I'm not saying that writers and directors should always give us what we want; but, based on everything that happens up to the climax, that's the only thing that makes any sense. This is a good-hearted film, with a haunting score by James Horner; but don't expect to be satisfied with the ending.Waitsel Smith",4,"GOOD-HEARTED STORY WITH UNNECESSARY, TRAGIC ENDING",1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,1769,"['good', 'top-shelf', 'Hallmark-style', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'Maine', 'named', 'Gilead', 'overcome', 'suspicions', 'ex-con', 'named', 'Percy', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Alison', 'Elliott', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'there', 'Working', 'Spitfire', 'Grill', 'lives', 'owner', 'crusty', 'soft-hearted', 'Hannah', 'also', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'fellow', 'waitress', 'Shelby', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'boyfriend', 'Joe', 'Kieran', 'Mulroney', 'mysterious', 'elusive', 'woodsman', 'Johnny', 'B', 'John', 'M.', 'Jackson', 'Not', 'be', 'touched', 'Percy', 'honesty', 'helpful', 'nature', 'hard-hearted', 'Nahum', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Shelby', 'husband', 'who', 'only', 'worst', 'Percy', 'who', 'meddling', 'eventually', 'sets', 'motion', 'chain', 'events', 'film', 'tragic', 'conclusion.But', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'way', 'absolutely', 'dramatic', 'purpose', 'ending', 'movie', 'Writer-director', 'Lee', 'David', 'Zlotoff', 'could', 'have', 'accomplished', 'everything', 'wanted', 'redemption', 'Nahum', 'revelation', 'Johnny', 'B.', 'coming', 'together', 'town', 'given', 'audience', 'what', 'wanted', 'eventual', 'happiness', 'Percy', 'chose', 'not', 'instead', 'gave', 'contrived', 'melodramatic', 'purposeless', 'ending', 'frankly', 'left', 'empty', 'Even', 'appearance', 'end', 'new', 'owner', 'Spitfire', 'Grill', 'was', 'lot', 'Percy', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'Percy', 'owning', 'Grill', 'happily', 'married', 'Joe', 'Johnny', 'B.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'writers', 'directors', 'should', 'always', 'give', 'what', 'want', 'based', 'everything', 'up', 'climax', 'only', 'thing', 'sense', 'good-hearted', 'film', 'haunting', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'satisfied', 'ending.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
