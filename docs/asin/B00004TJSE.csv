550714,AY6XIORKYRD3M,B00004TJSE,"""darc_light""","[1, 1]","Trunks:Prelude to Terror was another excellant Dragonball Z video. Eric Johnson, the voice actor who portrays Trunks, does a wonderful job of bringing real depth of emotion to his character,he realistically conveys all of Trunks rage and suffering of having lived in a future dystopia ruled by sadistic, bloodthirsty Androids, and his hope for a better future.On the down side, the battle with King Cold was, sadly, no contest, one would have expected a better fight from Frieza's father, but Trunks defeated him in less than five minutes, without even getting his hands dirty. And killing someone who's injured and begging for his life is something I just can't stomach, even if he is evil. Other than that it was an excellant and often humorous video, Goku insulting Vegeta's hated pink shirt, Yamcha's terror at the thought of marriage, Goku laughing out of control learning of Trunks' mismatched parentage, and Krillin suddenly becoming a big headed ladies-man when he put on Roshi's sunglasses, to name just a few scenes.",5,Prelude to Terror,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,1026,"['Trunks', 'Prelude', 'Terror', 'was', 'excellant', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'video', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'voice', 'actor', 'who', 'Trunks', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'real', 'depth', 'emotion', 'character', 'realistically', 'conveys', 'Trunks', 'rage', 'suffering', 'having', 'lived', 'future', 'dystopia', 'ruled', 'sadistic', 'bloodthirsty', 'Androids', 'hope', 'better', 'future.On', 'down', 'side', 'battle', 'King', 'Cold', 'was', 'sadly', 'contest', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'better', 'fight', 'Frieza', 'father', 'Trunks', 'defeated', 'less', 'five', 'minutes', 'even', 'getting', 'hands', 'dirty', 'killing', 'someone', 'who', 'injured', 'begging', 'life', 'something', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'even', 'evil', 'Other', 'was', 'excellant', 'often', 'humorous', 'video', 'Goku', 'insulting', 'Vegeta', 'hated', 'pink', 'shirt', 'Yamcha', 'terror', 'thought', 'marriage', 'Goku', 'laughing', 'control', 'learning', 'Trunks', 'mismatched', 'parentage', 'Krillin', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'big', 'headed', 'ladies-man', 'when', 'put', 'Roshi', 'sunglasses', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'scenes']",Dragon Ball Z - Trunks - Prelude to Terror VHS

I am writing this review to update the info posted by Amazon which appears to be out of date.  This is one of my favorite DBZ DVDs to date because of the variety.

550717,A2O4RTEFIJ918H,B00004TJSE,Free Pizza,"[4, 7]","This DVD comes with 5 spectacular episodes, making it an excellent edition to your Dragon Ball Z Collection. The first episode concludes Trunks's fight with King Kold. (Well, it technically shows the final death of Frieza, but that is also shown in the previous DVD along with the rest of the fight.) Anyway, the first episode on this DVD has the fight with King Kold and then the part where Trunks takes everyone to meet Goku. In the second episode, Trunks and Goku talk and he reveals some pretty astounding secrets. Make sure to watch the third episode in Japanese, if you decide to watch any of them in Japanese. The English one actually says completely incorrect information. (Yeah right, it won't take them three years to collect the Dragon Balls.)Anyway, that's the first three episodes. The other two are filler but still very fun to watch. (Actually, they are some of the best, specifically the second.) The fourth episode on this DVD details how everyone prepares for the upcoming battle, including Vegeta's training in 400G. It's pretty exciting to watch all that happens. The last episode has Goku and Picollo learning to drive, which is really funny and exciting too. As for the DVD itself, it has no bonus features, but most Dragon Ball Z fans should be used to this.

The American voices have gotten better, but they just can't compare to the Japanese vocals especially when doing power moves. The dvd is nicely done with the usual features...Play movie, chapter search/select, bonus material, and language/subtitle select. This being my first purchase of the newer DBZ discs, I didn't know that there are two sets of subtitles. One set is for the English vocals and the other is for the Japanese track. No wonder the subtitles kept going eventhough there were no Japanese vocals to be heard. The picture quality is as clear as you can get, but you will notice that the quality of the dbz episodes has degraded over the years. Maybe someone will start remastering these over time cause they do need it. Still, it's a great dvd. Trunks arrival and his conversation with Goku over who his parents were is priceless.

Once I had  reserved it, my body filled with jitters.  It was so amazing.  The day it  came to my house, It was in the vcr 38 seconds after it came in the door.  I give the tape 5 stars for these reasons: Anime: 5 star worthy,  some mistakes but thats okay because its just a &quot;cartoon&quot; Action:  5 stars without a doubt.  Extremely good. The fighting mainly takes place  at the beginning of this tape Music: 5 stars-Excellent.  The music sets the  mood. It wouldnt be as good without the music. Plot: 5 stars. Realistic and  fun.  You wanna keep watching. Adrenaline: 5 stars- This'll get your blood  flowing from head to toe.  The plot goes as follows: After fighting with  Frieza, the mysterious Super Saiyan goes at it with Frieza's dad, King  Cold.  Shortly after, our original hero from the beginning, Goku, arrives  yet, the young one predicted exactly where and when Goku would arrive. How  could that be?  Goku and the young kid talk about whats gonna happen  because Goku realizes that this person is from the future.  After realizing  about destiny, which you'de have to watch to enjoy, Goku starts his  training once again. I strongly suggest that you buy this video. Beyond  wonderful.
