I find myself humming the songs when I'm least expecting it. Great for teaching concepts, as well, like Big, Small, Fast and Slow. Points out body parts in the ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" song. All around a great buy. Would recommend to other parents highly.",5,Love it!,1137196800,"01 14, 2006",2006,349,"['son', 'totally', 'enraptured', 'DVD', 'music', 'great', 'find', 'humming', 'songs', 'when', ""'m"", 'least', 'expecting', 'Great', 'teaching', 'concepts', 'as', 'well', 'Big', 'Small', 'Fast', 'Slow', 'Points', 'out', 'body', 'parts', 'Head', 'Shoulders', 'Knees', 'Toes', 'song', 'great', 'buy', 'Would', 'recommend', 'other', 'parents', 'highly']",Baby Nick Jr. Curious Buddies - Let's Move

883802,A3I5E81ATXAEO8,B0007NFLS6,"Katherine Turner ""The Great Kathalfa""","[0, 0]","This (and the whole Curious Buddies series) features puppets that bear a striking resemblance to those on Jack's Big Music Show - it is a Spiffy Production - so if your kids are already stoked about getting up and dancing to the music on Jack's, they'll regard this as another Super Swell Dance Party.  I gave it four stars because my toddler boys do get up and spaz around to it as I had hoped; but, parents, if you appreciate the gentle humor of Jack's, you may want to turn this on and leave the room, because there ain't no funny gonna make anyone older than five guffaw here.  It makes Elmo look like Noel Coward.  It is adult-annoying to defcon level Barney.",4,Help for the Fledgling Couch Potato,1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,664,"['whole', 'Curious', 'Buddies', 'series', 'puppets', 'bear', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Jack', 'Big', 'Music', 'Show', 'Spiffy', 'Production', 'so', 'kids', 'are', 'already', 'stoked', 'getting', 'up', 'dancing', 'music', 'Jack', ""'ll"", 'regard', 'Super', 'Swell', 'Dance', 'Party', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'toddler', 'boys', 'do', 'get', 'up', 'spaz', 'had', 'hoped', 'parents', 'appreciate', 'gentle', 'humor', 'Jack', 'may', 'want', 'turn', 'leave', 'room', 'ai', ""n't"", 'funny', 'gon', 'make', 'anyone', 'older', 'five', 'guffaw', 'here', 'Elmo', 'look', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'adult-annoying', 'defcon', 'level', 'Barney']",Baby Nick Jr. Curious Buddies - Let's Move

She's had the others since she was around 12 months, and they've always been her favorites. But 'Let's Move' will probably replace them - it's the best so far!! The songs are great, the interaction with the ""Buddies"" is fun, and it really does get her to ""move""! She'll even stretch and rest when they do.
