1526681,A2N3398M4RCNPY,B007549XLG,Antonio Peace,"[11, 17]","The problem with a lot of great shows that try to be more than SpongeBob or Flapjack, is that it has no audience. They end up stuck in this void between its targeted audience, and people that don't know how to grow up and move on.Granted, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But when it becomes clouded by what you loved as a child and not letting something move on in a creative way while still maintaining its core ideology, that's when opinions become questionable at best.X-Men ran off in the opposite direction of Iron Man and Wolverine, and what I mean by that is that it doesn't suck. The plot is put together well enough that it's easy to follow, but it still has some twist and unexpected turns. It may have been a little out there for people who rarely watch anime, but it still doesn't reach anywhere near far-fetched.Each of the X-Men represent themselves well here. Cyclops is cocky towards Logan, even though he shouldn't be, and a bit of an emotional wreck. Logan is still the angry little hairy man he always is. Storm is the level headed voice of reason. Beast is the scientific genius we all know and love. Emma is the sensual den mother with very capable psychic abilities. Xavier retains his role as father, mentor, and guide for his students. Hisako is a teenager who is coming into her powers. They all come together nicely, even during the few times the characters clash over certain things.I hate to dedicate a section of my review to this, but since it seems to be an issue, yes Storm, Emma, and Jean are shapely women. But when have they not been!? Look at the females in the comics and 90's television series. Unless they are teenagers, they are shapely. Actually, Storm has more fabric on in this, than she has had in a while! Why this sort of thing is even an issue, is a little outlandish. The best I can come up with and not offend anyone, is that some people are either too blinded by rage to remember that women tend to be shapely in ALL comics, or that they just lived a sheltered life. I honestly don't know their thought process.Action wise, the show does a good job. There is just enough action to break up the drama of the show, and when there is action on screen it impresses. The show is wonderfully animated, Madhouse really did some of their best work here. While it is a bit more graphic than shows created for children, it's no more graphic that what you would see in the PG-13 DC releases. If you're familiar with Super-Man: Doomsday, Batman: Gotham Knight, etc, it's on par with those, but with a lot more style. Even when Logan has his Berserker Rage triggered the show doesn't exceed PG-13 status. Though it is the epitome of epicness!I've gone on long enough, and my apologies for making the review so long. This all wrapped in a nutshell is me saying, have an open mind people. Stop comparing every show that comes out directly with its source material. Source material is merely a road map for new ideas. As long as it is done in a creative way that doesn't throw away everything that made the source material great, diamonds can be formed from coal. This take on The X-Men may not be the best one available, but it is a good show and deserves to be recognized for that. Not bashed because it's not word for word, action for action, what you grew up with.",4,"Peter Pan Syndrome, it does exist.",1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,3309,"['problem', 'lot', 'great', 'shows', 'try', 'be', 'more', 'SpongeBob', 'Flapjack', 'audience', 'end', 'up', 'stuck', 'void', 'targeted', 'audience', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'grow', 'up', 'move', 'on.Granted', 'everyone', 'entitled', 'opinion', 'when', 'clouded', 'what', 'loved', 'child', 'not', 'letting', 'something', 'move', 'creative', 'way', 'still', 'maintaining', 'core', 'ideology', 'when', 'opinions', 'become', 'questionable', 'best.X-Men', 'ran', 'off', 'opposite', 'direction', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Wolverine', 'what', 'mean', ""n't"", 'suck', 'plot', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'enough', 'easy', 'follow', 'still', 'twist', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'out', 'there', 'people', 'who', 'rarely', 'watch', 'anime', 'still', ""n't"", 'reach', 'anywhere', 'far-fetched.Each', 'X-Men', 'represent', 'well', 'here', 'Cyclops', 'cocky', 'towards', 'Logan', 'even', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'bit', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'Logan', 'still', 'angry', 'little', 'hairy', 'man', 'always', 'Storm', 'level', 'headed', 'voice', 'reason', 'Beast', 'scientific', 'genius', 'know', 'love', 'Emma', 'sensual', 'den', 'mother', 'very', 'capable', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'Xavier', 'role', 'father', 'mentor', 'guide', 'students', 'Hisako', 'teenager', 'who', 'coming', 'powers', 'come', 'together', 'nicely', 'even', 'few', 'times', 'characters', 'clash', 'certain', 'things.I', 'hate', 'dedicate', 'section', 'review', 'be', 'issue', 'yes', 'Storm', 'Emma', 'Jean', 'are', 'shapely', 'women', 'when', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'Look', 'females', 'comics', '90', 'television', 'series', 'are', 'teenagers', 'are', 'shapely', 'Actually', 'Storm', 'more', 'fabric', 'had', 'while', 'Why', 'sort', 'thing', 'even', 'issue', 'little', 'outlandish', 'best', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'not', 'offend', 'anyone', 'people', 'are', 'either', 'too', 'blinded', 'rage', 'remember', 'women', 'tend', 'be', 'shapely', 'ALL', 'comics', 'just', 'lived', 'sheltered', 'life', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'thought', 'process.Action', 'wise', 'show', 'good', 'job', 'just', 'enough', 'action', 'break', 'up', 'drama', 'show', 'when', 'action', 'screen', 'show', 'wonderfully', 'animated', 'Madhouse', 'really', 'did', 'best', 'work', 'here', 'bit', 'more', 'graphic', 'shows', 'created', 'children', 'more', 'graphic', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'PG-13', 'DC', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Super-Man', 'Doomsday', 'Batman', 'Gotham', 'Knight', 'etc', 'par', 'lot', 'more', 'style', 'Even', 'when', 'Logan', 'Berserker', 'Rage', 'triggered', 'show', ""n't"", 'exceed', 'PG-13', 'status', 'epitome', 'epicness', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'long', 'enough', 'apologies', 'making', 'review', 'so', 'long', 'wrapped', 'nutshell', 'saying', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'people', 'Stop', 'comparing', 'show', 'out', 'directly', 'source', 'material', 'Source', 'material', 'merely', 'road', 'map', 'new', 'ideas', 'As', 'long', 'done', 'creative', 'way', ""n't"", 'throw', 'away', 'everything', 'made', 'source', 'material', 'great', 'diamonds', 'can', 'be', 'formed', 'coal', 'take', 'X-Men', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'available', 'good', 'show', 'be', 'recognized', 'Not', 'bashed', 'not', 'word', 'word', 'action', 'action', 'what', 'grew', 'up']",Marvel: X-Men Set- Animated Series

You also might find yourself wondering, why X-men in anime-style hasn't been done before. Especially, since the emotionalistic themes and fast-paced, dynamic action scenes so common to anime, lend themselves so well to the types of stories and characters we find in the X-men, resulting in a perfect marriage, and the best X-men animated series yet! Now, how do I justify that claim? Well, for starters, this is the best I've ever seen the X-men in animation form, and yes, I have seen all the other animated series (including the original 80s pilot). Second, I thought the characterizations were spot-on, and the plot unfolds like a good detective story, climaxing in one of the most emotional endings to an X-men story since the death of Jean Grey.Now, I know most of the other reviewers here on amazon give kudos to the animation in the series, but find it flawed in the story-telling. I notice two major objections to the series; one is to the choice of villians (the Inner Circle, U-men), instead of Magneto and the Mutant Brotherhood, and two, is the plot. I find the villain objection problematic give the choice of time and location for the series, this is post-Pheonix saga, Magneto is incarcerated, and the Brotherhood disbanded. Of course, they didn't have to choose that time and location for the series, but its a sensible one. How many times do we have to relive the Sentinels storyline? Everytime a new series gets started? That gets old. Also, the choice of villians works well with the addition of Emma Frost to the X team. Second, the plot is done as a single story-arc that takes place over the entire length of the series, tweleve episodes. This is unusual for an X-men animated series, but it hooked me in for the entire tweleve episodes, so it worked. Most X-men animated series do single episode stories, with a few multi-episode story-arcs, and maybe a weak seasonal arc. There are problems with that approach too, like losing your audience along the way, or over-streaching your seasonal arc.

1526694,A1MAQ2ZS6N50QJ,B007549XLG,James F. Briggs,"[0, 0]","So Marvel and Madhouse's team up effort on X-men.I can say I liked it. But it is definitely far from perfect. The good points however outweigh the bad, even so I will probably dwell more on the ""bad"" parts (Subject to opinion.)Good: The art. This is good anime design. Where characters are not all effectively carbon copies of each other with a different hairstyle or costume. It falls into the more realistic style, which is something Madhouse tends to lean towards.Overall plot was one of the better ones, even discounting certain areas where it falls flat. The dialogue heavy scenes were actually the more engaging for me.They avoided recycling the same story every X-Men show seems to go through. (Though it is touched on at the beginning this is more or less the aftermath of it.)Voice acting ranges from competent to well Steve Bloom. He's pretty much well mastered that job and none can really complain about his work and be taken seriously.Wolverine done right.Now the bad: *Spoilers ahead you be warned.)Anime ending. Yes sadly we can't escape from the overdone power of friendship and hope ending that plagues anime.Prof X's logic at the end. I suppose they were trying to show him being a mature responsible man accepting his role in what happened, except... he's totally wrong.  Without going into too much detail he's trying to accept part of the blame for something he was totally deceived about and just learned any details of during the series. I am all for a man owning up to his mistakes, but when the woman involved flat out lies to you, uses tech and other means to hide the child you and she had together from your eyes(and in this case his thoughts.) I don't see him as having any responsibility aside from forgetting to wear a condom 15 years ago.Any attempt to make the Prof ex lover remotely sympathetic. Sorry Dr Mengel and she are on the same level for crimes against humanity. Her poor me I just want to protect my boy tripe doesn't fly. (at least in the show the X-Men call her out on it over and over.)Anime mutants. The super mutant freak things that show up look like they belong in Resident Evil, not the X-Men. Seems another overused staple of anime had to be thrown in, where something is forced to change form and comes out as a mass of veins and misplaced tissue, with teeth in spots they just don't belong.Cyclops. I know he's far from the top favored member of the X-Men, but here they pretty much well reduce him to an emo wreck who can't get his act together. There are a few moments where he pulls his head out of his hind end and does the right thing, but they are pretty much well canceled out by his normal attitude.Action Scenes.. Yes I went there. I know some reviewers praised the action as excellent that said the plot was weak, but they have it backwards. The plot was well done with some flawed areas, and the action was mediocre with a few stand out good areas.Most of the action scenes consist of some bad guy showing up. Talking... more talking.. random X-man attacks.. bad guy deflects,(Which the scene is 7 out of ten times a still shot with voice work in it) more talking rinse and repeat until they manage to get the winning shot in. It's your standard anime fight where they talk more smack and take a few passes at each other, instead of actively trying to take their opponent out. On occasion they seem to pull out the budget and actually animate a scene, but the majority of the fights are as described before.Highly recommended for X-Men/Anime fans.Just recommended for X-Men fans.Barely recommended for X-Men fans who are not too fond of anime.3.8/out of 5 rounded up.",4,Mixed bag mostly good.,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,3632,"['So', 'Marvel', 'Madhouse', 'team', 'up', 'effort', 'X-men.I', 'can', 'say', 'liked', 'definitely', 'far', 'perfect', 'good', 'points', 'however', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'even', 'will', 'probably', 'dwell', 'more', 'bad', 'parts', 'Subject', 'opinion', 'Good', 'art', 'good', 'anime', 'design', 'Where', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'effectively', 'carbon', 'copies', 'other', 'different', 'hairstyle', 'costume', 'more', 'realistic', 'style', 'something', 'Madhouse', 'lean', 'towards.Overall', 'plot', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'even', 'discounting', 'certain', 'areas', 'where', 'flat', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'scenes', 'were', 'actually', 'more', 'engaging', 'me.They', 'avoided', 'recycling', 'same', 'story', 'X-Men', 'show', 'go', 'touched', 'beginning', 'more', 'less', 'aftermath', 'Voice', 'acting', 'ranges', 'competent', 'well', 'Steve', 'Bloom', 'pretty', 'much', 'well', 'mastered', 'job', 'none', 'can', 'really', 'complain', 'work', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.Wolverine', 'done', 'bad', '*Spoilers', 'ahead', 'be', 'warned', 'ending', 'Yes', 'sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'overdone', 'power', 'friendship', 'hope', 'ending', 'plagues', 'anime.Prof', 'X', 'logic', 'end', 'suppose', 'were', 'trying', 'show', 'being', 'mature', 'responsible', 'man', 'accepting', 'role', 'what', 'happened', 'totally', 'wrong', 'going', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'trying', 'accept', 'part', 'blame', 'something', 'was', 'totally', 'deceived', 'just', 'learned', 'details', 'series', 'am', 'man', 'owning', 'up', 'mistakes', 'when', 'woman', 'involved', 'flat', 'lies', 'tech', 'other', 'means', 'hide', 'child', 'had', 'together', 'eyes', 'case', 'thoughts', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'having', 'responsibility', 'aside', 'forgetting', 'wear', 'condom', '15', 'years', 'ago.Any', 'attempt', 'make', 'Prof', 'ex', 'lover', 'remotely', 'sympathetic', 'Sorry', 'Dr', 'Mengel', 'are', 'same', 'level', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'poor', 'just', 'want', 'protect', 'boy', 'tripe', ""n't"", 'fly', 'least', 'show', 'X-Men', 'call', 'out', 'Anime', 'mutants', 'super', 'mutant', 'freak', 'things', 'show', 'up', 'look', 'belong', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'not', 'X-Men', 'overused', 'staple', 'anime', 'had', 'be', 'thrown', 'where', 'something', 'forced', 'change', 'form', 'out', 'mass', 'veins', 'misplaced', 'tissue', 'teeth', 'spots', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong.Cyclops', 'know', 'far', 'top', 'favored', 'member', 'X-Men', 'here', 'pretty', 'much', 'well', 'reduce', 'emo', 'wreck', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'act', 'together', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'head', 'hind', 'end', 'right', 'thing', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'well', 'canceled', 'out', 'normal', 'attitude.Action', 'Scenes..', 'Yes', 'went', 'there', 'know', 'reviewers', 'praised', 'action', 'excellent', 'said', 'plot', 'was', 'weak', 'have', 'plot', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'flawed', 'areas', 'action', 'was', 'mediocre', 'few', 'stand', 'out', 'good', 'areas.Most', 'action', 'scenes', 'consist', 'bad', 'guy', 'showing', 'up', 'Talking', 'more', 'talking..', 'random', 'X-man', 'attacks..', 'bad', 'guy', 'deflects', 'scene', '7', 'ten', 'times', 'still', 'shot', 'voice', 'work', 'more', 'talking', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'manage', 'get', 'winning', 'shot', 'standard', 'anime', 'fight', 'where', 'talk', 'more', 'smack', 'take', 'few', 'passes', 'other', 'instead', 'actively', 'trying', 'take', 'opponent', 'out', 'occasion', 'seem', 'pull', 'out', 'budget', 'actually', 'animate', 'scene', 'majority', 'fights', 'are', 'described', 'before.Highly', 'recommended', 'X-Men/Anime', 'fans.Just', 'recommended', 'X-Men', 'fans.Barely', 'recommended', 'X-Men', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'fond', 'anime.3.8/out', '5', 'rounded', 'up']",Marvel: X-Men Set- Animated Series

This is definitely meant mostly for fans of the X-men comics and while it does appeal to anime and action fans again the storyline isn't truly original from what we've read in the X-men comics a hundred times before.

Magneto is locked up and is in prison somewhere, and the other big super villains are no where to been seen or heard of. So, what we get to see are lesser known enemies, the U-Men and the inner circle.All the better known X-Men are here and this series introduces a new junior X-Men member that I never heard of, but comic fans know her, Hisako Ichiki (Armor). We get to see how and why she joins the X-Men for this show. Also, Emma Forst joins the X-Men as well.This show started out great. Nice animation, storyline, and characters. Then, the Japanese story telling came in. There are a bunch of filer story that you do not need to know to progress the story, they are just there to drag the story along. Then, what worse is they tend to repeat the same old story that we heard way too much about. This whole series could be cut 1/3, if they just didn't throw in all that slow dragged out story telling.I like how they draw all the characters and background, but what I didn't like was them having them standing around and doing nothing. The action in this series is ridiculously less than anything I have seen before. In a 20 minute show, you be lucky to see 2 mins of action!!! Heck, in the last few shows, they barely did anything. They stood around telling themselves to wait and stand around watching the enemy's movements. There was 15 seconds of actions before that but was that even worth a buck to see??? I say no.The Japanese tend to draw really big boobs on females and this show is no different!!! If you like seeing that stuff. Buy, Buy, and Buy Now!!! All the females have really HUGE ONES HERE! The littlest is a D cup that's really saying something. So, when you see the other females, OMG!!!And for you all you gay guys/females out there, yeah, they draw nice packages on the guys as well. It's not ridiculous sized like the females, but yeah, you can say they got something down there. lolI like how they try to show more of the variety of characters in the marvel universe at the end, but they didn't do anything with them. All you see is them standing around or a frame shot of them helping other people. It's typical Japanese style animation.I really wish they would stop holding back all the action and actually draw interesting fight scenes that last longer than a minute or two. It gets really boring just seeing a few people just stand around to the next few people just stand around, to a minute fight, to people just walking slowly around, and so on. Man, that's boring!!!This show could had been so much better, but I guess this is what we get for what it is. Not it's not much.

I was even more thrilled when I heard it was coming to television, to the channel 'G4'.  I was not able to watch this series on Friday nights, but managed to view the encore on Sunday mornings.WHAT A LET DOWN!!!As another Amazon reviewer said, it's like porn without the porn.  I was not coming to watch porn.  I wanted to see X-Men, in action, spliced with the feel and look of Anime inkers.  Let me be clear, this is actually NOT porn.  But the female characters, exps: Storm and Emma Frost, look so rediculous with their G-cup sized breasts your not sure what your watching.  Your are teased every episode.  I don't think I saw one female with proportionly sized boobs.  Felt like I was watching Queen's Blade sometimes.Action wise this sucked.  This a talking Anime, and I hate animes where everyone justs stands around and chats.One factor though above all I thought would be stellar, that was Wolverine.  Anime is extremely bloody and violent at times.  I really thought the writers and animators would put his Healing Factor threw the ringer with epic scences of him getting mangled and recovering.  I NEVER saw it.Truth time:  I hated this series so much I gave up on it.  Could not make it threw the entire series.

1526716,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B007549XLG,Theo,"[3, 5]","Like many other long time X-Fans, I'm afraid I found this one an immense disappointment. I know it's easy to fall into hyperbole, but in all honesty, this may well be the single most boring cartoon I've ever seen.On the plus side, on a purely technical level the animation is superb. About as subtle as a tattoo of a flaming skull, but technically superb. Oh, and almost all of the chicks are drawn with giant racks, too. And when I say ""giant"", I really do mean giant. The kind that in the real world could only be achieved with truly industrial quantities of silicone.Actually, aside from the fact that everyone keeps their clothes on, the style of animation here is very much in the mould of high-budget R-rated anime. I'm not just talking about the spandex-clad chests: there's also the splatter and the gore. Measured purely in terms of screen time, the amount of violence in this show is probably about the same as you'd find in any other superhero cartoon. However, the feel and the texture of that violence is very different from what many viewers will be used to. There's something positively gratuitous about the way it's drawn. Indeed, it could almost be described as erotic... If that's your thing.And yet, despite all the violence and the chicks with the giant racks, the truth is that this has to be one of the most profoundly boring pieces of television I've ever seen. The problem is... Well, let me explain with a story.I remember back when I was about seven years old and I thought Star Wars was the greatest movie ever made. I also thought that because the best parts of Star Wars were the space battles, wouldn't Star Wars be even better if it was just one long space battle?Of course, I now know that it simply doesn't work that way. However technically impressive, however visually awe-inspiring, those climactic battles only mean something when we're emotionally invested in the characters. If we fundamentally just don't care about Luke Skywalker or the world he inhabits, we also won't care that much when - or indeed if - he blows up the Death Star. The special effects are reduced to being _just_ special effects. An impressive technical achievement to be sure, but nothing more than that.Unfortunately, that's the way it is with this show.In this series, in place of real character development all we get are emotional histrionics. In place of real storytelling, scenes of gratuitous violence are interspersed with lengthy and turgid exposition. And in those very rare, brief moments when things aren't gratuitously violent, histrionic, or even turgid, everyone suddenly becomes inanely bright and cheery for no apparent reason.The honest truth is that at no point did I find myself caring about the characters in this story even the tiniest little bit. The animators could have drawn us an episode in which every single one was fed slowly into a meat-grinder and it'd barely have rated a yawn.Frankly, I would just have found it as unutterably boring as every other episode in the series.Theo.",1,Like A Porno Film Without The Actual Porn,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3022,"['many', 'other', 'long', 'time', 'X-Fans', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'found', 'one', 'immense', 'disappointment', 'know', 'easy', 'fall', 'hyperbole', 'honesty', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'single', 'most', 'boring', 'cartoon', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.On', 'plus', 'side', 'purely', 'technical', 'level', 'animation', 'superb', 'as', 'subtle', 'tattoo', 'flaming', 'skull', 'technically', 'superb', 'Oh', 'almost', 'chicks', 'are', 'drawn', 'giant', 'racks', 'too', 'when', 'say', 'giant', 'really', 'do', 'mean', 'giant', 'kind', 'real', 'world', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'achieved', 'truly', 'industrial', 'quantities', 'silicone.Actually', 'aside', 'fact', 'everyone', 'clothes', 'style', 'animation', 'here', 'very', 'much', 'mould', 'high-budget', 'R-rated', 'anime', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'spandex-clad', 'chests', 'also', 'splatter', 'gore', 'Measured', 'purely', 'terms', 'screen', 'time', 'amount', 'violence', 'show', 'probably', 'same', ""'d"", 'find', 'other', 'superhero', 'cartoon', 'However', 'feel', 'texture', 'violence', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'something', 'positively', 'gratuitous', 'way', 'drawn', 'Indeed', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'described', 'erotic', 'thing.And', 'yet', 'violence', 'chicks', 'giant', 'racks', 'truth', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'profoundly', 'boring', 'pieces', 'television', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'problem', 'Well', 'let', 'explain', 'story.I', 'remember', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'about', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'thought', 'Star', 'Wars', 'was', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'also', 'thought', 'best', 'parts', 'Star', 'Wars', 'were', 'space', 'battles', 'would', ""n't"", 'Star', 'Wars', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'long', 'space', 'battle', 'course', 'now', 'know', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'However', 'technically', 'impressive', 'however', 'visually', 'awe-inspiring', 'climactic', 'battles', 'only', 'mean', 'something', 'when', ""'re"", 'emotionally', 'invested', 'characters', 'fundamentally', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'world', 'also', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'that', 'much', 'when', 'indeed', 'up', 'Death', 'Star', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'reduced', 'being', '_just_', 'special', 'effects', 'impressive', 'technical', 'achievement', 'be', 'sure', 'nothing', 'more', 'that.Unfortunately', 'way', 'show.In', 'series', 'place', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'get', 'are', 'emotional', 'histrionics', 'place', 'real', 'storytelling', 'scenes', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'are', 'interspersed', 'lengthy', 'turgid', 'exposition', 'very', 'rare', 'brief', 'moments', 'when', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'gratuitously', 'violent', 'histrionic', 'even', 'turgid', 'everyone', 'suddenly', 'inanely', 'bright', 'cheery', 'apparent', 'reason.The', 'honest', 'truth', 'point', 'did', 'find', 'caring', 'characters', 'story', 'even', 'tiniest', 'little', 'bit', 'animators', 'could', 'have', 'drawn', 'episode', 'single', 'one', 'was', 'fed', 'slowly', 'meat-grinder', ""'d"", 'barely', 'have', 'rated', 'yawn.Frankly', 'would', 'just', 'have', 'found', 'unutterably', 'boring', 'other', 'episode', 'series.Theo']",Marvel: X-Men Set- Animated Series
