To see this DVD was wonderful. The new music sounds like the early material from Bridge of Sighs. The vocals sound like James Dewar. Great vocals from Davey Pattison on this DVD.I would love to hear a Paul Rodgers collaberation with vocals on some new and old Robin Trower songs. The bonus interview was great to hear Robin Trower talk about his history in music.

I mean, how many other musicians can still play THIS solid after so long? I LOVE The Who and am a Stones fan too, but these guys have honestly seen their best days come & go while Trower is STILL on the top of his game.Having said all of that, Davey Pattison does a great job on vocals. I wasn't too sure how I'd take to him, but he really impressed me and I thought he was the perfect man for the job. I just wish we still had Jimmy Dewar around - nobody can come close to inflecting emotion into Robins' songs like he could.

It's a great show. Trower's guitar prowess is still evident.I've been a Trower fan since I bought his Bridge of Sighs LP back in 1974. Having grown up listening to the late James Dewar doing vocals with Trower, I have a bit of trouble getting used to Davey Pattison doing vocals. Pattison's voice works well with Trower's playing but I still prefer James Dewar's style. That aside, this is still an excellent DVD of Robin Trower's current live set. Long time Trower fans should enjoy this one.Overall, a very good concert DVD with Trower's guitar front and center.For those who aren't familiar with Robin Trower, this DVD would be a good introduction to his playing. Don't expect any fancy staging or theatrics in this performance; there aren't any. Trower is all about the music.For those new to Trower's music, you might want to buy his classic 1970s release Bridge of Sighs and his 2010 album The Playful Heart before you buy this one.Another Robin Trower concert DVD that's worth having is Trower's collaboration with Jack Bruce (formerly of Cream) called Seven Moons Live.",5,Excellent Concert DVD By Trower - Recorded In 2005,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,1285,"['Robin', 'Trower', 'one', 'best', 'guitarists', 'scene', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'recognition', 'DVD', 'live', 'concert', 'performed', 'Germany', 'Trower', '60th', 'birthday', '2005', 'great', 'show', 'Trower', 'guitar', 'prowess', 'still', 'evident.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Trower', 'fan', 'bought', 'Bridge', 'Sighs', 'LP', 'back', '1974', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'listening', 'late', 'James', 'Dewar', 'doing', 'vocals', 'Trower', 'have', 'bit', 'trouble', 'getting', 'used', 'Davey', 'Pattison', 'doing', 'vocals', 'Pattison', 'voice', 'well', 'Trower', 'playing', 'still', 'prefer', 'James', 'Dewar', 'style', 'aside', 'still', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'Robin', 'Trower', 'current', 'live', 'set', 'Long', 'time', 'Trower', 'fans', 'should', 'enjoy', 'one.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Trower', 'guitar', 'front', 'center.For', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Robin', 'Trower', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'introduction', 'playing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fancy', 'staging', 'theatrics', 'performance', 'are', ""n't"", 'Trower', 'music.For', 'new', 'Trower', 'music', 'might', 'want', 'buy', 'classic', '1970s', 'release', 'Bridge', 'Sighs', '2010', 'Playful', 'Heart', 'buy', 'one.Another', 'Robin', 'Trower', 'concert', 'DVD', 'worth', 'having', 'Trower', 'collaboration', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'formerly', 'Cream', 'called', 'Seven', 'Moons', 'Live']",N/A

Come into 2000 and here you have Robin - maybe a bit greyer, more wrinkles and less hair but man can he still smoke on the guitar.Has a bonus interview where he talks about his music, his influences, working with other artists and also his new custom guitar. I personally found out more about him through the interview and where he came from as well as picking up some new music suggestions. But Robin does his best talking with his guitar.If you're a guitar player (or not), you really should get this DVD. Being a guitar player myself I really got some personal playing tips of his guitar style. He's not a Hendrix clone but does have some similarities to Hendrix's style. There's more than enough examples here to keep me going for the next 6 months learning.I would have liked to see a few more songs off For Earth Below or Bridge of Sighs, but all the songs are great to listen to.BTW this was put out around the same time as 20th Century Blues (get that album as well).

All the bands are trying their best to get a new mdvd to show their best performance.  This is by far one of THE best shows I have seen lately.  The audio is first class and the video as good as it gets.  The bass is perhaps the best I have in my entire collection, which is quite the opposite of the America Live in Chicago mdvd I just bought.  I really want and need another subwoofer but you could not tell on this recording it was so perfect.The vocals were great too, so much I kept for getting about Dewar being gone.  When old bands make a new recording everyone hopes it will be as good as the originals and when the band line up changes the problems are harder to keep the same feeling and spirit of the original while sounding as good or better.  You see this often when a band splits and both parts keep playing the old material.  The vocals here were nearly identical in the way it felt and sounded originally.This is where the real talent shines.  Everything sounds as good but better with a new modern recording capacity.  The old bands either release an enhanced version of their old recording for dvd or throw a new concert and record it hoping for the best.  Usually it is mixed blessings but not here.I really bought this for Bridge of Sighs.  I only have a few Trower cds but I always held Bridge of Sighs in my list of best of the best recordings like RUSH 2112, or Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon and Fleetwood Mac Rumors or Rolling Stones Some Girls and so on.  This was the recording to get but another shot at some of my all time favorite music.  Usually I do not like the new release songs as much that bands add to a concert to promote their new release instead of playing the hits everyone wants to hear the most.  Well the other songs new to me because they were not on Bridge of Sighs sounded almost as good.

The only way it could have been any better is if Trower had performed all of his fist three albums and Victims of the Fury on it.  Trower celebrates his 60th birthday the way he should... by putting in one of the best single sonic performances anyone has ever manipulated from a guitar.  Always one of my favorite guitarists, Trower now takes top spot by showing that he, like the finest wine, is only going to continue to get better with age.  All of the newer material on this actually holds its own against the classics from Bridge of Sighs and Twice Removed From Yesterday.  And the producers did the best job I've seen yet of giving us guitar freaks a solid view of what exactly this genius is doing with his fingers as he pulls impossibly thick, dripping tones from his highly polished Strat fretboards.  I noticed it's even visible that he's using Fulltone equipment now (including the Clyde wah-wah pedal), and the Dejavibe does a perfect job of adding that classic pulsing, throbbing, swirling amorphous mass of sound from every note.  I tell ya, even though you can see him play every note, there's still no figuring out exactly what this guy does to make gobs of sonic honey drip from the front of his Marshall cabs.  There's really no point in commenting on any specific song, except to mention that he does the impossible and actually IMPROVES on the tone of the song Bridge of Sighs.  Notes just hang in the air and throb and pulse and resonate with overtones that are not humanly possible to produce.  If you love guitar get this NOW, and get a couple copies for when you wear out your first, because no guitarist in his right mind could ever get enough of this.  I was totally disgusted and disheartened when I saw that Trower had no recording contract for some time a while back, and seemed to disappear from the scene.  Well, checking out trowerpower.com shows that he's now selling out venues, adding new shows to his American tour, and finally getting back the recognition he deserves (Bridge of Sighs was Guitar Player magazine's '74 album of the year).  I got this the moment I saw that it existed and the people at the store thought I was insane because i was so excited that it was out - and it does NOT disappoint in any way.  God bless Robin Trower for never compromising and for maintaining the passion for guitar that still has him wincing and contorting his facial expression with each note, as though that note at that time was the most important thing in the world to him.  The best.  Ever.  May Robin Trower live well past 100 and continue to improve as he does.

947401,AFSFRSVWGQZC6,B000BPK2MA,Surefire,"[4, 4]","Robin Trower has been one of my favorite guitarists for the last 30 years. My first exposure to him was the Robin Trower Live album from 1976. What a great album! Soon thereafter, I purchased the ""Bridge of Sighs"" album and it became one of my favorite albums. The ""Living Out of Time: Live"" DVD was certainly no let down. I was delighted to see that songs from ""Bridge of Sighs"" were included in the live selections. Good renditions of ""Too Rolling Stoned"" and ""Bridge of Sighs"" are included. ""Bridge of Sighs"" sounds great and is actually extended on the DVD. ""Day of the Eagle"" is included here too, as well as new material. It all sounds fresh and is a delight to view. This DVD is now my favorite Robin Trower release. I've watched it several times and it never gets old.I also want to add that it's a real delight for we guitar players, as we're able to observe closely many of Robin's unique techniques. From the standpoint of a guitar player, there's much here to glean and learn. If you like rock and blues/rock guitar get this DVD and study a master of this genre. It's well-filmed with many great close-up shots of Robin's guitar work.

947405,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000BPK2MA,trebe,"[4, 4]","Robin Trower is a consummate musician, without a pretentious rock star bone in his body.  It has always been about the music for the former Procol Harum guitarist, who had a breakout early in his solo career, with the classic album Bridge of Signs (1974).  When it comes to 70's heavy rock, Robin Trower was undeniably one of the major forces in the genre, although unfortunately his name may not be among the first that comes to mind.  While appreciated by a loyal core of fans, Trower never found major commercial success or widespread recognition.  His signature spacey, blue based, Hendrix influenced sound, has evolved a bit over the decades, but was never in the mainstream.  Dedicated to playing the music in his heart, Trower has always followed his own path.Living Out Of Time: Live (2005) is a concert performance recorded at the Rockpalast Crossroads Festival in Bonn, Germany in 2005, on the occasion of Robin's sixtieth birthday.  The band features Davey Pattison on vocals, Dave Bronze on bass, and Pete Thompson on drums.  Like Trower, these are veteran musicians not inclined to prancing around on stage.  The venue is very intimate, with the small appreciative audience up close to the stage.  The setlist includes classics from the early days, up to material from Trower's most recent release at the time, Living Out of Time (2003), recorded by the very same musicians on the stage.Robin Trower is a master guitar player, who seems to feel the emotion of each note he plays coursing through his body.  In his hands, the Fender Stratocaster seems to become an extension of his being, through which he projects his feelings.  This kind of honest expression of pure emotion is extremely rare.  The passage of the years is evident on Trower's face, but time hasn't dulled his technical skills much.  Still it has been a while since 1973, and while songs like Too Rolling Stoned, Day of the Eagle, Daydream, and Little Bit of Sympathy, still retain their essence, these classics are now played a little slower, more bluesy, and with slightly less aggression.Long time fans will never forget the contributions of vocalist James Dewar, who played with Trower throughout the 70's and early 80's, and passed away in 2002.  Davey Pattison first recorded with Trower in 1987, and has a similar voice and singing style.  His deep powerful vocals resonate well, and he is truly able to do justice to the Dewar material.  Pattison's performance on Daydream is magnificent, and along with Trower's inspired playing, makes this one of the evening's high points, taking things back to Robin's earliest days as a solo artist.The material from the Pattison era is different, but also quite powerful.  Mostly blues based mid-tempo rock, with a tight song structure.  Sweet Angel, Living Out of Time, Rise Up Like The Sun, Close Every Door, and Please Tell Me, are some of the stronger tracks.  The song Breathless features Robin on vocals.The presentation captures nicely the intimate feeling of the venue, and the tight performance of the band.  Davey Pattison of course gets his share of screentime, but Trower is the focus of the show.  For the most part, the editing is well done.  The camera doesn't stay locked on Robin even during a solo,  there is a nice mix of cuts to keep things interesting, but you can usually still get some good looks at what he is doing.  The 73 minute, thirteen song concert concludes with the traditional closer, Little Bit of Sympathy.One on the bonus features is a half hour interview where Robin discusses his roots, some of the backstories behind his music, and his plans for the future.  This interview is a rare treat, as Robin Trower is such a humble, soft spoken man.  This release is highly recommended to Trower fans, as well as those who appreciate classic blues based rock.  RT is definitely the real deal, and a genuine class act.",5,"a hard rock pioneer, guitar virtuoso, and a real class act . . .",1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,3875,"['Robin', 'Trower', 'consummate', 'musician', 'pretentious', 'rock', 'star', 'bone', 'body', 'always', 'been', 'music', 'former', 'Procol', 'Harum', 'guitarist', 'who', 'had', 'breakout', 'early', 'solo', 'career', 'classic', 'album', 'Bridge', 'Signs', '1974', 'When', '70', 'heavy', 'rock', 'Robin', 'Trower', 'was', 'undeniably', 'one', 'major', 'forces', 'genre', 'unfortunately', 'name', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'mind', 'appreciated', 'loyal', 'core', 'fans', 'Trower', 'never', 'found', 'major', 'commercial', 'success', 'widespread', 'recognition', 'signature', 'spacey', 'blue', 'based', 'Hendrix', 'influenced', 'sound', 'evolved', 'bit', 'decades', 'was', 'never', 'mainstream', 'Dedicated', 'playing', 'music', 'heart', 'Trower', 'always', 'followed', 'own', 'path.Living', 'Time', 'Live', '2005', 'concert', 'performance', 'recorded', 'Rockpalast', 'Crossroads', 'Festival', 'Bonn', 'Germany', '2005', 'occasion', 'Robin', 'sixtieth', 'birthday', 'band', 'Davey', 'Pattison', 'vocals', 'Dave', 'Bronze', 'bass', 'Pete', 'Thompson', 'drums', 'Trower', 'are', 'veteran', 'musicians', 'not', 'inclined', 'prancing', 'around', 'stage', 'venue', 'very', 'intimate', 'small', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'up', 'close', 'stage', 'setlist', 'classics', 'early', 'days', 'up', 'material', 'Trower', 'most', 'recent', 'release', 'time', 'Living', 'Time', '2003', 'recorded', 'very', 'same', 'musicians', 'stage.Robin', 'Trower', 'master', 'guitar', 'player', 'who', 'feel', 'emotion', 'note', 'coursing', 'body', 'hands', 'Fender', 'Stratocaster', 'become', 'extension', 'being', 'projects', 'feelings', 'kind', 'honest', 'expression', 'pure', 'emotion', 'extremely', 'rare', 'passage', 'years', 'evident', 'Trower', 'face', 'time', ""n't"", 'dulled', 'technical', 'skills', 'much', 'Still', 'been', 'while', '1973', 'songs', 'Too', 'Rolling', 'Stoned', 'Day', 'Eagle', 'Daydream', 'Little', 'Bit', 'Sympathy', 'still', 'retain', 'essence', 'classics', 'are', 'now', 'played', 'little', 'slower', 'more', 'bluesy', 'slightly', 'less', 'aggression.Long', 'time', 'fans', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'contributions', 'vocalist', 'James', 'Dewar', 'who', 'played', 'Trower', '70', 'early', '80', 'passed', 'away', '2002', 'Davey', 'Pattison', 'first', 'recorded', 'Trower', '1987', 'similar', 'voice', 'singing', 'style', 'deep', 'powerful', 'vocals', 'resonate', 'well', 'truly', 'able', 'do', 'justice', 'Dewar', 'material', 'Pattison', 'performance', 'Daydream', 'magnificent', 'Trower', 'inspired', 'playing', 'one', 'evening', 'high', 'points', 'taking', 'things', 'back', 'Robin', 'earliest', 'days', 'solo', 'artist.The', 'material', 'Pattison', 'era', 'different', 'also', 'quite', 'powerful', 'Mostly', 'blues', 'based', 'mid-tempo', 'rock', 'tight', 'song', 'structure', 'Sweet', 'Angel', 'Living', 'Time', 'Rise', 'Up', 'Sun', 'Close', 'Every', 'Door', 'Please', 'Tell', 'Me', 'are', 'stronger', 'tracks', 'song', 'Breathless', 'Robin', 'vocals.The', 'presentation', 'captures', 'nicely', 'intimate', 'feeling', 'venue', 'tight', 'performance', 'band', 'Davey', 'Pattison', 'course', 'share', 'screentime', 'Trower', 'focus', 'show', 'most', 'part', 'editing', 'well', 'done', 'camera', ""n't"", 'stay', 'locked', 'Robin', 'even', 'solo', 'nice', 'mix', 'cuts', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'can', 'usually', 'still', 'get', 'good', 'looks', 'what', 'doing', '73', 'minute', 'thirteen', 'song', 'concert', 'traditional', 'closer', 'Little', 'Bit', 'Sympathy.One', 'bonus', 'half', 'hour', 'interview', 'where', 'Robin', 'roots', 'backstories', 'music', 'plans', 'future', 'interview', 'rare', 'treat', 'Robin', 'Trower', 'such', 'humble', 'soft', 'spoken', 'man', 'release', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Trower', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'appreciate', 'classic', 'blues', 'based', 'rock', 'RT', 'definitely', 'real', 'deal', 'genuine', 'class', 'act']",N/A
