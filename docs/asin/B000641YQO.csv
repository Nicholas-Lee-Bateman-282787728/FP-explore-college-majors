If you have been a Wolf's Rain collector up to this point... be forewarned that you already own these episodes.

858426,A2EQRK21C2WFI6,B000641YQO,"D. Allen ""Wolfman""","[18, 29]","After an interlude of developing some of the side charactors, this volumne gets back into the main journey of the pack.  Finally, we get to see some of the long awaited former life of Kiba and how his journey began.  Interesting charactor developement proceeds on the rest of the pack...especially on Tsume, and Tolboy faces a crises in which he snaps.I was a bit somber on Volumne 3.  Hubb (the detective), his ex-wife, Cher, and Quint (the wolf hunter) are very interesting charactors, but it's truly Kiba, Tsume, Hige and Tolboy (and the flower maiden, Cheza) that have truly driven this story.  Not to mention, Blue, who we begin to see in ways we have never seen before.  The tention and the story really begin to build in Volumne 4...as well as the new developements.  Has Kiba truly found paridise?  What has really happened to Homina (Lord Darsha's love who has been stricken by Paridise).  And above all that, enter the most vile of villens...the nobel behind the mysery of all...JageraThe only other thing I can add is just wait for Volumne 5!  Volumne 4 is the build up to the climax, but I guarentee every episode in Volumne 5 will have you cheering, crying, or wishing to step through the screen to throttle the villeness Jagera.This is one of the most unique anime series ever produced.  If you like something very different, with some of the best story telling ever written, some of the best sound track music (Yes, there are some new tracks in this volumne, and Yoko Kanno continues to top herself), and some of the best anime ever contained within a television series, Wolf's Rain is a must.  Studio Bones (also producers of Cowboy Bebop)is truly one of the most ground breaking anime groups ever!One last request to Studio Bones...please...please don't do to Kiba and the pack what you did to Spike at the end of the Cowboy Bebop series!!!  Also...Please make a feature film of Wolf's Rain (Like the Cowboy Bebop movie...not just a re-hash!)",5,The haunting fairy tale continues beyond excellence!,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,1959,"['interlude', 'developing', 'side', 'charactors', 'volumne', 'back', 'main', 'journey', 'pack', 'Finally', 'get', 'see', 'long', 'awaited', 'former', 'life', 'Kiba', 'how', 'journey', 'began', 'Interesting', 'charactor', 'developement', 'proceeds', 'rest', 'pack', 'especially', 'Tsume', 'Tolboy', 'crises', 'snaps.I', 'was', 'bit', 'somber', 'Volumne', '3', 'Hubb', 'detective', 'ex-wife', 'Cher', 'Quint', 'wolf', 'hunter', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'charactors', 'truly', 'Kiba', 'Tsume', 'Hige', 'Tolboy', 'flower', 'maiden', 'Cheza', 'have', 'truly', 'driven', 'story', 'Not', 'mention', 'Blue', 'who', 'begin', 'see', 'ways', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'tention', 'story', 'really', 'begin', 'build', 'Volumne', '4', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'developements', 'Has', 'Kiba', 'truly', 'found', 'paridise', 'What', 'really', 'happened', 'Homina', 'Lord', 'Darsha', 'love', 'who', 'been', 'stricken', 'Paridise', 'enter', 'most', 'vile', 'villens', 'nobel', 'mysery', 'JageraThe', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'can', 'add', 'just', 'wait', 'Volumne', '5', 'Volumne', '4', 'build', 'up', 'climax', 'guarentee', 'episode', 'Volumne', '5', 'will', 'have', 'cheering', 'crying', 'wishing', 'step', 'screen', 'throttle', 'villeness', 'Jagera.This', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'anime', 'series', 'ever', 'produced', 'like', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'best', 'story', 'telling', 'ever', 'written', 'best', 'sound', 'track', 'music', 'Yes', 'are', 'new', 'tracks', 'volumne', 'Yoko', 'Kanno', 'top', 'best', 'anime', 'ever', 'contained', 'television', 'series', 'Wolf', 'Rain', 'must', 'Studio', 'Bones', 'also', 'producers', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'ground', 'breaking', 'anime', 'groups', 'ever', 'One', 'last', 'request', 'Studio', 'Bones', 'please', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Kiba', 'pack', 'what', 'did', 'Spike', 'end', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'series', 'Also', 'Please', 'make', 'feature', 'film', 'Wolf', 'Rain', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 're-hash']",Wolf's Rain: Recollections - Volume 4

They are a reprise of the story up to this point, and nothing more.  That might work for the TV audience, for which much time has passed, but for someone who just watched the third DVD last week it's an unexpected delay in an otherwise compelling series.There are a few extra insights here, but most of what you will see is excerpts from the previous episodes.  The continuity is well done, and the effect is something like a four episode special, but at the end you will be right were you were at the end of episode 14.  If your just renting and watching then you could easily skip this DVD and go right on to the fifth.If you are buying than you will have to wrestle with your compulsion for completeness.  If you have none go directly to five without a further thought.  If you are compulsive buy it, but be prepared to feel faintly cheated.  Or you could buy it and wait 6 months before viewing it in order to get the intended effect.Since the first episodes were excellent this DVD is just as good, and the focus on only the key moments makes you more aware of the music, which is in a class by itself.  Truly, This is probably the first time I've told people that something was really good but that they shouldn't buy it.

It's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14, with narration from each character in the background. I believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they weren't getting high ratings on the anime series. Anyway, I didn't buy this dvd, because I have the japanese box set instead, which saved me a lot of $$. I watched each episode, and I must say the only part I liked was the opening and ending theme. Other than that, there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die-hard wolf's rain fan. But, don't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window.

The artwork is fantastic and the soundtrack inspired (thank god for Yoko Kanno - she is hands down my favorite anime composer today).  But there is so much to be explored in this story!  I'm very disappointed that Studio Bones wasted 4 hours of critical plot development time to a recap.  Perhaps it was money related - I don't know the details.  What I do know is that as a fan of this series, I wish that these episodes could have been used to develop the story rather than just throwing in old animation.Bottom line: If you've not watched any of the previous episodes, you could get this DVD and catch up on the story in only 4 episodes as opposed to 12.

Even the infamous last 2 episodes of Evangelion didn't go so far as this and they were running out of money. What is the excuse here? To pay 20$ for an entire dvd of stuff I've already seen.
