1139487,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0012U9IN2,barry,"[8, 10]","There are many reality shows on television now and some are just standard fare while others truly rise above.  Project Runway is one of those and perhaps the best and most intense is Hell's Kitchen.  This is a show about cooking and filtering through the 12 aspiring chefs week after week to get to the TOP CHEF who gets to run his own restaurant.  What differs here is the extent of Ramsay's participation in each episode.  He is not only there to judge after each challenge but actually walks the contestants through every step each week as he helps them learn the skills necessary to be a succesful chef.  He is there to greet them in the morning, there throughout any and all challenges, there to judge and there to truly mentor.Gordon Ramsay is a premier English chef and many find his demeanor and foul mouth a little crass and maybe a gimmick.  I can tell you that if you watch this season from beginning to end you will see that neither is true.  He speaks honestly without being cruel but acknowledges that sometimes the truth hurts.  As the show progresses you see how much he truly invests into these inspiring chefs and tough love is the only way to wipe an aspiring top chef of possible bad habits and train them with essential skills.  Many you think will fall early hold strong and others egos get in the way.  But rest assured.  There is much drama here and we get to know much about the contestants but this is about cooking and producing a master chef.  Ramsay takes the contestants on a spellbinding journey and you the viewer will only gain respect for the sincerity of Ramsay and how he puts his heart 100% into these people.  He drives them, expects perfection and not surprisingly achieves it.To see the show uncensored is a hoot and brings the reality of the show that much more to life.  To see as the season progresses how Ramsay forms his own special bond with the contestants is priceless.  He is a master chef providing his knowledge.  Ramsay is a real guy - passionate and dedicated and it takes this 100 fold to dedicate yourself to trying to train 12 aspiring chefs.  This show is hugely addictive and I am thrilled that season 2 is coming out on dvd next week.  With Kitchen Nightmare's as well as this Gordon Ramsay is providing viewers with much enjoyment and education on the realities of food and cooking.  Highly recommended.",5,Great reality show with the amazing Ramsay,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,2363,"['are', 'many', 'reality', 'shows', 'television', 'now', 'are', 'just', 'standard', 'fare', 'others', 'truly', 'rise', 'Project', 'Runway', 'one', 'perhaps', 'best', 'most', 'intense', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'show', 'cooking', 'filtering', '12', 'aspiring', 'chefs', 'week', 'week', 'get', 'TOP', 'CHEF', 'who', 'run', 'own', 'restaurant', 'What', 'differs', 'here', 'extent', 'Ramsay', 'participation', 'episode', 'not', 'only', 'there', 'judge', 'challenge', 'actually', 'contestants', 'step', 'week', 'learn', 'skills', 'necessary', 'be', 'succesful', 'chef', 'there', 'greet', 'morning', 'challenges', 'judge', 'there', 'truly', 'mentor.Gordon', 'Ramsay', 'premier', 'English', 'chef', 'many', 'find', 'demeanor', 'foul', 'mouth', 'little', 'crass', 'maybe', 'gimmick', 'can', 'tell', 'watch', 'season', 'beginning', 'end', 'will', 'see', 'true', 'honestly', 'being', 'cruel', 'truth', 'show', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'chefs', 'tough', 'love', 'only', 'way', 'wipe', 'aspiring', 'top', 'chef', 'possible', 'bad', 'habits', 'train', 'essential', 'skills', 'Many', 'think', 'will', 'fall', 'early', 'hold', 'strong', 'others', 'egos', 'get', 'way', 'rest', 'assured', 'much', 'drama', 'here', 'get', 'know', 'much', 'contestants', 'cooking', 'producing', 'master', 'chef', 'Ramsay', 'contestants', 'spellbinding', 'journey', 'viewer', 'will', 'only', 'gain', 'respect', 'sincerity', 'Ramsay', 'how', 'heart', '100', '%', 'people', 'perfection', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'it.To', 'see', 'show', 'uncensored', 'hoot', 'reality', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'life', 'see', 'season', 'how', 'Ramsay', 'own', 'special', 'bond', 'contestants', 'priceless', 'master', 'chef', 'providing', 'knowledge', 'Ramsay', 'real', 'guy', 'passionate', 'dedicated', '100', 'fold', 'dedicate', 'trying', 'train', '12', 'aspiring', 'chefs', 'show', 'hugely', 'addictive', 'am', 'thrilled', 'season', '2', 'coming', 'out', 'dvd', 'week', 'Kitchen', 'Nightmare', 'as', 'well', 'Gordon', 'Ramsay', 'providing', 'viewers', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'education', 'realities', 'food', 'cooking', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Hell's Kitchen: Season 1 Deluxe With Slip Case

There is no merit to this show.  Where once we scoffed at the curse words on ""The Osbourne's,"" we don't even shrug when every other word is a curse word, and likely millions of children are tuned in at 8PM.

Read about him in one of Anthony Bourdain's travel books (forgot the title) and smartacre Tony rated him as the best chef in Britain. That's high praise coming from the King of Snark. When he came to America to torture newbie chefs with their eye on the prize I had to watch. (Add to it that one of his sous chefs, Maryanne, was an acquaintance of a friend of mine. She got her gig wearing a ""I hate Rocco Dispirito"" tee shirt. Gordon recognized a kindred spirit.) If you haven't seen Hell's Kitchen, settle in for some high flyin' F-bombs and the meanest boss since Scrooge. But Gordon fights the good fight not for himself, but for his customers. It's all about the food and the paying customer. He makes grown men cry. He's had several pass out. He turns women chefs Hillary Clinton-tough. But he also paid the untrained but spunky cook from the Fried Chicken & Waffle House way through culinary school. Anybody who's seen him with his family on Gordon Ramsey's F-Word knows deep down inside he's a softy. I wouldn't want to work for him, but I'd love to eat his food. His commitment to fresh local ingridents made simply & carefully speaks volumes about him. I'm saving up for a night at his NYC restaurant. First NYC, and then Merry Olde England.

1139492,A11ED8O95W2103,B0012U9IN2,"lighten_up_already2 ""lighten_up_already2""","[8, 9]","I only discovered Hell's Kitchen as season two was beginning and it immediately became the only reality TV show that I ever made a point to keep up with every week.  I'll admit that it's the sheer spectacle of watching the victims...er...contestants survive my idea of hell, working in a restaurant, while attempting to meet Chef Gordon Ramsay's exacting standards that keeps me glued to the tube when this show is on.Here's the short list of what I love about this show.First, there's Chef Ramsay's license to abuse people, within a context of course.  The context being that one of these people will win a huge prize that they in all liklihood would never obtain on thier own: their own fancy restaurant.I look at it like cooking boot camp.  Sure, the contestants are being continually cursed and screamed at.  Of course, we see many hours of real time condensed to a relatively few minutes each episode, so I wonder just how intense it looks ""real time"".  I guess we'll never know, but it's for a purpose and I assume they knew what they signed up for.  There's just something about a frantic, frazzled  amateur chef being cursed over messing up the risotto that I find hilarious.  How difficult is risotto to make, anyway?Second, it's a cooking show that really isn't about cooking at all, but about working as a team in a ""fish out of water"" (and into the frying pan) kind of situation where there's fire, smoke, steam, and screaming.  How do normal people react in stressful situations?  Some rise to the occasion and discover greatness in themselves while others are exposed for the arrogant blowhards that they really are.Third, those wonderful obscenities!  Wow, when I was watching this show I was fascinated by just what Gordon Ramsay could be saying when they bleeped him out.  What could it be?  Well, with this DVD it's all there, so if you like to hear the ""f word"" derisively spoken and screamed with English flair at people, you'll love this show.Seriously, Chef Ramsay uses obscenities so much they become routine and cliche (except I'd imagine if they were directed at me!).  You'd think by watching this show that all Chef Ramsay does is glower and scream at people, and it's a shame that his BBC show ""The F Word"" is not so easily accessed here in the states.  You really get to know Chef Ramsay on that show.Fourth, on this DVD you don't have to suffer the commercials.  A Hell's Kitchen episode is about 40 minutes long.  Even with the show recorded it was annoying to fast forward through all that stuff.  It's fun to just kick back and bask in the heat of Hell's Kitchen without having to reach for a remote every few minutes.All in all, a reality show that I am thankful isn't reality for me.  The only time I worked in a restaurant I was a dishwasher and I broke so many dishes I was fired after three days.  I've done my time in ""hell"", and now you can too!",4,Hear the obscenities while you feel the heat!,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2885,"['only', 'discovered', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'beginning', 'immediately', 'became', 'only', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'point', 'keep', 'up', 'week', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'sheer', 'spectacle', 'watching', 'victims', 'er', 'contestants', 'survive', 'idea', 'hell', 'working', 'restaurant', 'attempting', 'meet', 'Chef', 'Gordon', 'Ramsay', 'exacting', 'standards', 'glued', 'tube', 'when', 'show', 'short', 'list', 'what', 'love', 'show.First', 'Chef', 'Ramsay', 'license', 'abuse', 'people', 'context', 'course', 'context', 'being', 'one', 'people', 'will', 'win', 'huge', 'prize', 'liklihood', 'would', 'never', 'obtain', 'thier', 'own', 'own', 'fancy', 'restaurant.I', 'look', 'cooking', 'boot', 'camp', 'Sure', 'contestants', 'are', 'being', 'continually', 'cursed', 'screamed', 'course', 'see', 'many', 'hours', 'real', 'time', 'condensed', 'relatively', 'few', 'minutes', 'episode', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'intense', 'real', 'time', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'purpose', 'assume', 'knew', 'what', 'signed', 'up', 'just', 'something', 'frantic', 'frazzled', 'amateur', 'chef', 'being', 'cursed', 'messing', 'up', 'risotto', 'find', 'hilarious', 'How', 'difficult', 'risotto', 'make', 'anyway', 'Second', 'cooking', 'show', 'really', ""n't"", 'about', 'cooking', 'about', 'working', 'team', 'fish', 'water', 'frying', 'pan', 'kind', 'situation', 'where', 'fire', 'smoke', 'steam', 'screaming', 'How', 'do', 'normal', 'people', 'react', 'stressful', 'situations', 'rise', 'occasion', 'discover', 'greatness', 'others', 'are', 'exposed', 'arrogant', 'blowhards', 'really', 'are.Third', 'wonderful', 'obscenities', 'Wow', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'show', 'was', 'fascinated', 'just', 'what', 'Gordon', 'Ramsay', 'could', 'be', 'saying', 'when', 'bleeped', 'out', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'Well', 'DVD', 'there', 'like', 'hear', 'f', 'word', 'derisively', 'spoken', 'screamed', 'English', 'flair', 'people', ""'ll"", 'love', 'show.Seriously', 'Chef', 'Ramsay', 'obscenities', 'so', 'much', 'become', 'routine', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'were', 'directed', ""'d"", 'think', 'watching', 'show', 'Chef', 'Ramsay', 'glower', 'scream', 'people', 'shame', 'BBC', 'show', 'F', 'Word', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'accessed', 'here', 'states', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Chef', 'Ramsay', 'show.Fourth', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'suffer', 'commercials', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'episode', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'Even', 'show', 'recorded', 'was', 'annoying', 'fast', 'forward', 'stuff', 'fun', 'just', 'kick', 'back', 'bask', 'heat', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'having', 'reach', 'remote', 'few', 'minutes.All', 'reality', 'show', 'am', 'thankful', ""n't"", 'reality', 'only', 'time', 'worked', 'restaurant', 'was', 'dishwasher', 'broke', 'so', 'many', 'dishes', 'was', 'fired', 'three', 'days', ""'ve"", 'done', 'time', 'hell', 'now', 'can', 'too']",Hell's Kitchen: Season 1 Deluxe With Slip Case

I use to work at a Black Angus a few years back and while the kitchen was chaotic to and had some short temper flare ups and a few shouting arguments between the head cook and others it was nothing compared to Ramsay.  The show seems to play out a little like the series survivor but Ramsay has the ultimate say on who leaves and who stays after the episode, and seeing who the competing players pick from their teams is sometimes understandable and other times shows the true face of some of the players conniving and scheming to be the final winner.

Andrew - The loud mouth of the bunch6. Jimmie - The clumsey oaf7. Elsie - Ramsey's pick, started with no culinary experience8. Carol anne - Never worked in a kitchen9. Mary Ellen - The quiet mouse10. Jessica - The lesbian headhunter11. Wendy - The know it all who knows nothing12. Chris - The arrogant cocky male.Ok, lets start with some pros.Extras - I'm suprised a show like this has them. Altough most of the extra's are made during season 4, they are really wonderful. From the HK tour, to Chef Ramsey's take on each of the contestants. The artwork is wonderfully done. We have a shiny, glossy slip cover that fits over the case with the same art. Another pro, the series was perfect for three discs, we are not going to the menu, and find 2 episodes on each disc, but 4.Cons :(The theme song has been changed to an annoying tune that I'm not a fan of.The extras, although great, are very minimal and are over way too fastI also hate the package type with 2 overlaying discs on one side, and the third on the other side. You must also remove the discs to read the episode synopsises.On the FenceThe menu design, we have one menu that displays everything. No episode selection screen, well except for on the main menuThe video quality. I know this was shot with a camera, but they could've cleaned it up a little bit.The audio track.
