The exploitation theme is carried out with great enthusiasm with large amounts of nudity, lesbian themes, whipping and even a horny spider, but all somewhat harmlessly.  Visually, the movie is quite classy with good production values and this is a good quality print.  This is certainly much more watchable than many other exploitation movies dragged out of the vault for release on DVD in recent times.  Overall whilst this is no masterpiece, it does combine some good moments coherently with surreal elements and it all looks pretty into the bargain.

Hamlow,"[38, 39]","The sight of a woman in white gown spread open, running full frontal through the woods has got to be a good sign, coming as it does in Nude For Satan's opening moments.On his way to a house call, racing down the highway in his VW bug, Doctor William Benson nearly has an accident as he sees the woman in white standing in the middle of the road. As he is recovering from his near miss, he hears a crash behind him. He finds a Mini with the woman inside injured, presumably for the same reason as he. He puts Susan in his car and goes for help. Note: how did he know her name later? He didn't go through her purse or anything that I could see.He finds a castle and enters. The place is a deserted and decrepit place. He sees a painting of a woman, then finds that woman rushing to greet him. To his surprise, it's none other than the woman he rescued, except she calls him Peter. She's also more carefree and happy, and she ends up seducing him. She also spouts some puzzling words on memory and time: ""What is memory but a fraction of time wrapped in the parentheses of the past?"" Wow, sounds like dialogue from Dr. Who, Colin Baker era. And also, ""The past is not in time anymore, and time is silence. There is no space here for memories--it's always now.""Meanwhile, Susan, apparently recovered, goes to the castle, where she is invited in by a mysterious man in black. He welcomes her in but there's a sinister air about him, as he momentarily undresses her with a glance of his eyes. A hallucination or no? She sees a painting of a man who looks like William, except he's dressed in 19th century clothes. She runs into him, and he not only calls her Evelyn, but acts like a buffoon. What's happening should be kind of obvious by now, adding the woman's mysterious words, and those of a book William finds: ""The light is twofold, the way is only one. The essence of life is not in time. He who has made a pact with Him, belongs to Him.""The mysterious stranger says some words about life that are intriguing and true: ""... an illusion, like life. We delude ourselves that we live, that we love, that we die. When we see our mistake, we prefer to ignore it. Then, everything becomes a nightmare."" A nightmare is exactly what William and Susan go through once they figure out what's going on.There's whippings, lesbian sex, and enough full frontal nudity. Rita Calderoni (Susan/Evelyn) also played a dual role in The Reincarnation Of Isabel as Laureen/Isabella, and we see more of her here than in Isabel. If this didn't have the skin and violence, this would make a great Dr. Who story. As it is, it's a piece of weird but fascinating Euro-horror, more coherent than The Reincarnation Of Isabel, and with a good puzzle for the viewer to figure out.",4,Weird but fascinating Euro-sleeze horror,1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,2748,"['sight', 'woman', 'white', 'gown', 'spread', 'open', 'running', 'full', 'frontal', 'woods', 'got', 'be', 'good', 'sign', 'coming', 'Nude', 'Satan', 'opening', 'moments.On', 'way', 'house', 'call', 'racing', 'down', 'highway', 'VW', 'bug', 'Doctor', 'William', 'Benson', 'nearly', 'accident', 'woman', 'white', 'standing', 'middle', 'road', 'recovering', 'near', 'miss', 'crash', 'Mini', 'woman', 'inside', 'injured', 'presumably', 'same', 'reason', 'Susan', 'car', 'help', 'Note', 'how', 'did', 'know', 'name', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'purse', 'anything', 'could', 'see.He', 'castle', 'enters', 'place', 'deserted', 'decrepit', 'place', 'painting', 'woman', 'then', 'woman', 'rushing', 'greet', 'surprise', 'none', 'other', 'woman', 'rescued', 'Peter', 'also', 'more', 'carefree', 'happy', 'up', 'seducing', 'also', 'puzzling', 'words', 'memory', 'time', 'What', 'memory', 'fraction', 'time', 'wrapped', 'parentheses', 'past', 'Wow', 'dialogue', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'era', 'also', 'past', 'not', 'time', 'anymore', 'time', 'silence', 'space', 'here', 'memories', 'always', 'now', 'Meanwhile', 'Susan', 'apparently', 'recovered', 'castle', 'where', 'invited', 'mysterious', 'man', 'black', 'sinister', 'air', 'momentarily', 'glance', 'eyes', 'hallucination', 'painting', 'man', 'who', 'William', 'dressed', '19th', 'century', 'clothes', 'not', 'only', 'Evelyn', 'buffoon', 'What', 'happening', 'should', 'be', 'kind', 'obvious', 'now', 'adding', 'woman', 'mysterious', 'words', 'book', 'William', 'light', 'twofold', 'way', 'only', 'one', 'essence', 'life', 'not', 'time', 'who', 'made', 'pact', 'Him', 'Him', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'words', 'life', 'are', 'intriguing', 'true', 'illusion', 'life', 'delude', 'ourselves', 'live', 'love', 'die', 'When', 'see', 'mistake', 'prefer', 'ignore', 'Then', 'everything', 'nightmare', 'nightmare', 'exactly', 'what', 'William', 'Susan', 'go', 'once', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'whippings', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'enough', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Rita', 'Calderoni', 'Susan/Evelyn', 'also', 'played', 'dual', 'role', 'Reincarnation', 'Isabel', 'Laureen/Isabella', 'see', 'more', 'here', 'Isabel', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'skin', 'violence', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'story', 'piece', 'weird', 'fascinating', 'Euro-horror', 'more', 'coherent', 'Reincarnation', 'Isabel', 'good', 'puzzle', 'viewer', 'figure', 'out']",Nude For Satan

That, and I'll eat my hat if the model on the cover is Rita Calderoni.  The point is that Redemption films is trying to be a little sneaky here, and I don't know why they feel they should.  The movie is what it is, and it's going to have its fans as well as those who think the whole thing is goofy crap, but the cover isn't going to move anyone from one camp to the other.  The only reason for substituting the cover image is to fool someone into buying it who might be turned off by film stills that are obviously from a 1970's film.Not much of a plot here, but that's probably secondary.  Two travelers, a man and a woman who previously did not know each other, find themselves prisoners of a demonic force inhabiting an ancient castle after experiencing a car wreck on a nearby road.  While confined, they meet doubles of themselves, doubles who have none of the inhibitions of their originals.  Exactly why these doubles exist, or what the motives are behind the mysterious man who embodies the supernatural force are never really explained.  The motives of the director are pretty plain though; to squeeze in as much nudity and orgiastic behavior as possible.I've never been especially keen on artsy-porn, ala Jess Franco, although admittedly I've not seen enough of it to completely write off the genre.  Still, that's what Nude for Satan most reminds me of, and it didn't work for me this time.  Rita Calderoni is certainly attractive enough to look at for the duration of the film, with or without her clothes, so the movie has that going for it, but otherwise, there's very little to cover the story's nakedness.  Evidently there is another version of this film, a hardcore XXX version which used body doubles for the main characters.  I can actually see more reasons for that version than this one, due to the paperthin plot.  In fact, now that I think about it, the edited version does in fact look exactly like a porn film with all the porn removed, albeit with the nudity left in.Two stars for the attractive Rita Calderoni, Iolanda Mascitti, and Barbara Lay.
