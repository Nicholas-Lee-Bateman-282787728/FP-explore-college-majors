You get the unaired first shooting of the first episode of the show and the publicly released version along with the next three episodes in the story arc.  The pilot and first aired version are notably different and seeing the doctor portrayed as a more villainous vs friendly character is completely cool.  The alternative dialog interview of the cast/production crew is nicely done and very informative.  The discussion of how the show was designed for children aged 8-14 and the infighting between the folks from BBC drama and BBC kids is really interesting.So, if you have a chance to grab this for little money, do get it.",5,If you ignore price ....,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,830,"['set', 'aside', 'fact', 'disk', 'now', 'bundled', 'less', 'money', 'part', 'ofDoctor', 'Who', 'Beginning', 'Unearthly', 'Child', '/', 'Daleks', 'Edge', 'Destruction', '1', '3', 'disk', 'great', 'get', 'unaired', 'first', 'shooting', 'first', 'episode', 'show', 'publicly', 'released', 'version', 'next', 'three', 'episodes', 'story', 'arc', 'pilot', 'first', 'aired', 'version', 'are', 'notably', 'different', 'seeing', 'doctor', 'portrayed', 'more', 'villainous', 'vs', 'friendly', 'character', 'completely', 'cool', 'alternative', 'dialog', 'interview', 'cast/production', 'crew', 'nicely', 'done', 'very', 'informative', 'discussion', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'designed', 'children', 'aged', '8-14', 'infighting', 'folks', 'BBC', 'drama', 'BBC', 'kids', 'really', 'interesting.So', 'have', 'chance', 'grab', 'little', 'money', 'do', 'get']",N/A

It even includes the never aired pilot. the seller thinks it is some sort of rare art work, it's just a tv show from 1960, and not even a very good episiode of DR Who at that. It was the first and that is it's only claim to fame besides being shown twice. The first shownig was right after the Kennedy shooting and the BBC did not think many kids were watching so they showed it the following week also to make sure they saw the start. I have every show in existance. and this is not worth the price, unless you can find an autorgraphed copy, yet the start died before dvd's came out. so look before you enter the police call box.

1073130,A3I312N7ISZ960,B000PY7HHA,"Mr. Nicholas Pearson ""Cert HE (Open)""","[1, 1]","'An Unearthly Child' is probably the most important television serial within Doctor Who lore, as it is the first ever appearance of the Doctor, who, at this point, is simply regarded as a crotchety old man stumbling through time and space with his granddaughter Susan.  The long-established idea of time-lords, along with regeneration etc. were years away, and children followed William Hartnell's portrayal with awe and wonder.  Joining Hartnell on the main cast list were Carole Ann Ford as Susan Foreman (the Doctor's granddaughter - although there has been much controversy regarding this in the Whovian community for a number of reasons), Jacqueline Hill as history teacher Barbara Wright and William Russell as Ian Chesterton.  The serial, itself, was written by Anthony Coburn and C.E. Webber and produced by the wonderful Verify Lambert, with associate production done by Mervyn Pinfield.  Made up of four separate episodes, the serial was broadcast from 23rd November - 14th December 1963, and was considered an average success, even following the tragic news of the Kennedy Assassination.  It was not until 'The Daleks' that Who-Mania truly began, but this serial certainly laid down the foundation for the major franchise it was to become, and still is.The plot of this four-episode opener surrounds the Doctor 'abducting' Susan's two curious teachers at Coal Hill School, after they follow her home following a series of purported inconsistencies in her behaviour as a supposed contemporary school-girl.  The Doctor explains his and Susan's very vague back-story as two alien run-always, and in the turbulence that follows, the Tardis lands in prehistoric Earth (roughly 100,000 B.C).  The following three episodes show how the Doctor and his new-found companions come into contact with a paleolithic tribe, calling themselves the 'Tribe of Gum', and how their efforts of unravelling the secret of making fire come into conflict with the four travellers.  They are subsequently kidnapped, hunted, bound and imprisoned by the tribe for their ability to make fire (after seeing the Doctor lighting up his pipe), and after their attempt to make amiable contact with the cave-tribe, the rest of the serial surrounds their plan to get back to the Tardis and away from the current time-period.  Initially, this first episode was going to have a completely different plotline, with the main cast being shrunk down to inch-size due to the effects of the Tardis.  However, this plot was later used within the first serial of the show's second season ('Planet of Giants' - 1964), and 'An Unearthly Child' was chosen as the first serial to be broadcast as the show opener.  In fact, a lot of the early scripts that didn't make the grade, so to speak, were later re-worked into continuity via Audio releases.This opener to the Doctor Who franchise was released onto VHS in 1990 and, subsequently, was remastered and released onto DVD in 2006 as part of a box-set entitled 'The Beginning', which includes the first three serials starring the First Doctor and his earliest companions, along with a plethora of bonus material for the absolute fan and general viewer alike.  This specific review is focusing on the serial that is found on 'Disk 1' of the aforementioned box-set, and one can most definitely see the effort that has been put into the re-mastering and up-scaling of the original videotape, with much sharper picture quality and improved sound.  It is of importance to mention that one of the most interesting inclusions as part of the bonus material is that of the original pilot episode, which portrays the Dcotor as a much more vicious and unforgiving individual, as well as giving Susan a much more unusual and 'alien' presence.  There are also camera shots, costume designs and extra scripting that didn't make the final cut shown; one example being that Susan says she 'was born in the 49th century', as opposed to 'another time, another world' in the broadcast version.  This re-remastered and edited pilot episode using VidFIRE technology is available to see when choosing 'Play All' on the DVD menu (and within the Episode and Scene Selection options), whilst the original version, including outtakes is available to see within the list of special features.  This means that, when 'playing all', the inclusion of the pilot episode before the episode titled 'An Unearthly Child' results in the watching of five episodes altogether, as opposed to the four episodes that make up the finalised serial, at a running time of approximately 120 minutes, and not the 95 minutes advertised.  Also included on this disk are four comedy sketches starring David Walliams, with a guest appearance by Peter Davison and a short Who-themed music video utilising the electronic opening soundtrack used in the title sequences during the Hartnell/Troughton era.  Audio commentary is provided on episodes one and four, as well as on the pilot studio recording, with contributions from Waris Hussein (Director), Verify Lambert (Producer), Carole Ann Ford (Susan Foreman), William Russell (Ian Chesterson) and Gary Russell (Moderator).  A photo gallery showing photographs of the rehearsals, the set designs and promotional material round up the special features on this disk, alongside informative and interesting production notes and English subtitles for the hard-of-hearing.'An Unearthly Child' is a staple release on any Whovian's shelf, although I would certainly recommend purchasing the 'Beginning' box-set that this individual DVD forms an initial part of, which has recently been re-packaged with an alternative cover design.  This primary television outing with the Doctor in his initial first incarnation will enthrall and garner interest for the more modern 2005+ generation of Doctor Who fans and will provide loving memories of the start of this pepper-pot shaped phenomenon for the older generation of Classic Who enthusiasts.",4,The Debut of the Doctor and the Beginning of a Multi-Generation Spanning

1073131,A3F3D064D0QW95,B000PY7HHA,Neil Barto,"[1, 2]","An Unearthly Child is how Doctor Who all begins, it is the very first episode of the whole series starring William Hartnell as The Doctor. It originally aired in November 1963 the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The story introduces Ian and Barbara, two teachers who are worried about a student named Susan. When the teachers follow Susan home to a junkyard, they grow increasingly alarmed and on entering into the junkyard Susan has mysteriously disappeared. Only junk and a strange police box are all that are in the junkyard. When a crotchety old man appears in the junkyard and is seen heading towards the police box, both Ian and Barbara approach him asking for his help in finding Susan, but the old man refuses. Suddenly a sound is heard from the box...Susan's voice. Barbara and Ian break into the police box and find themselves in the Tardis - a spaceship that travels through time and space. The old man is Susan's Grandfather called the Doctor. Unwilling to let the teachers leave, the Doctor sets the spaceship running and takes the four travellers into earth's far distant past. An Unearthly Child lasts four episodes and is approx. 95 minutes. It is chuck full of extras: The original Pilot episode is included which was redone when the show was actually aired on TV to tone down how crotchety the Doctor was. Also included is the pilot 40-minute unedited studio recording (basically the pilot episode before all the flaws were taking out). Included is commentary; Doctor Who theme in 5.1 surround sound; Comedy sketches; photo gallery; and information text that goes with each episode.",4,Doctor Who in the beginning,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,1616,"['Unearthly', 'Child', 'how', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'whole', 'series', 'starring', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'Doctor', 'originally', 'aired', 'November', '1963', 'day', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'assassinated', 'story', 'introduces', 'Ian', 'Barbara', 'two', 'teachers', 'who', 'are', 'worried', 'student', 'named', 'Susan', 'When', 'teachers', 'follow', 'Susan', 'home', 'junkyard', 'grow', 'increasingly', 'alarmed', 'entering', 'junkyard', 'Susan', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'Only', 'junk', 'strange', 'police', 'box', 'are', 'are', 'junkyard', 'When', 'crotchety', 'old', 'man', 'junkyard', 'seen', 'heading', 'police', 'box', 'Ian', 'Barbara', 'approach', 'asking', 'help', 'finding', 'Susan', 'old', 'man', 'Suddenly', 'sound', 'heard', 'box', 'Susan', 'voice', 'Barbara', 'Ian', 'break', 'police', 'box', 'find', 'Tardis', 'spaceship', 'time', 'space', 'old', 'man', 'Susan', 'Grandfather', 'called', 'Doctor', 'Unwilling', 'let', 'teachers', 'leave', 'Doctor', 'spaceship', 'running', 'four', 'travellers', 'earth', 'far', 'distant', 'past', 'Unearthly', 'Child', 'four', 'episodes', 'approx', '95', 'minutes', 'chuck', 'full', 'extras', 'original', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'included', 'was', 'redone', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'actually', 'aired', 'TV', 'tone', 'down', 'how', 'crotchety', 'Doctor', 'was', 'Also', 'included', 'pilot', '40-minute', 'unedited', 'studio', 'recording', 'basically', 'pilot', 'episode', 'flaws', 'were', 'taking', 'out', 'Included', 'commentary', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'theme', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'Comedy', 'sketches', 'gallery', 'information', 'text', 'episode']",N/A
