1550894,A3KVAS0IALLIHE,B008DGUQZM,"bbrockRailFan ""Brian Brocksmith""","[2, 6]",You ever watch a movie and the main character is extremely annoying? This is it! Skye McCole Bartusiak plays the main character a lazy writer want-a-be newly wed. She (as expected) is nosey but she also plays off as some cutesy air headed Cali girl. This movie has a ridiculously low budget in every aspect. Skye does a terrible job over-acting at every opportunity. The make-up and special effects are beyond terrible. Dont waste your money on this stinker.,1,Sick Boy and odd Zombie type move - review,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,458,"['ever', 'watch', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'Skye', 'McCole', 'Bartusiak', 'main', 'character', 'lazy', 'writer', 'want-a-be', 'newly', 'expected', 'nosey', 'also', 'off', 'cutesy', 'air', 'headed', 'Cali', 'girl', 'movie', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'budget', 'aspect', 'Skye', 'terrible', 'job', 'over-acting', 'opportunity', 'make-up', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'terrible', 'Dont', 'money', 'stinker']",N/A

I liked it, but I think they could have done a whole lot more with this movie, definitely better than what it is. I picked it up at a local blockbuster that was closing for 3.99 and the disc was almost mint condition.

Zombie babies - hate those, too sick to be scary, zombie kids - oh yeah, big creepy factor.  So they nailed it with the zombie kid part and the suspense and progression towards the reveal and the eventual climax action was good - but here is where the drawback part, comes in.  Every one played their respective role well - maybe, too well.  The female lead in this is so bloody OCD and screechy over-reactive and dare I say, dumb,  on almost everything you can think of, that I was looking forward to what I hoped, would be the end.  The film spent much wasted time setting up for the last 20 minutes of the movie that you wanna FFW the remote button to death to get away from this chick.  This time could have been so much better used, with less on her, more shifting or weird sounds, maybe rotted finger grappling under the door bottom edge and some better Rochon use to develop the tension of the back story - instead, we get a Jerry Springer show candidate with dialogue that just-don't -end!  Okay, getting that off my chest...once things start to line up I really got into this very well and got my zombie on.  So not a bad made film, not in anyway --- but you gotta have a high patience ability, to get where you want to be here.",3,"very good, but with a drawback",1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,1317,"['What', 'drew', 'was', 'Ms.', 'Rochon', 'was', 'been', 'fan', 'hers', 'time', 'Zombie', 'hate', 'too', 'sick', 'be', 'scary', 'zombie', 'kids', 'oh', 'yeah', 'big', 'creepy', 'factor', 'nailed', 'zombie', 'kid', 'part', 'suspense', 'progression', 'reveal', 'eventual', 'climax', 'action', 'was', 'good', 'here', 'where', 'drawback', 'part', 'one', 'played', 'respective', 'role', 'well', 'maybe', 'too', 'well', 'female', 'lead', 'so', 'bloody', 'OCD', 'screechy', 'over-reactive', 'dare', 'say', 'dumb', 'almost', 'everything', 'can', 'think', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'what', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'film', 'spent', 'much', 'wasted', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'wan', 'FFW', 'remote', 'button', 'death', 'get', 'away', 'chick', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'used', 'less', 'more', 'shifting', 'weird', 'sounds', 'maybe', 'rotted', 'finger', 'grappling', 'door', 'bottom', 'edge', 'better', 'Rochon', 'use', 'develop', 'tension', 'back', 'story', 'instead', 'get', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'show', 'candidate', 'dialogue', 'just-do', ""n't"", '-end', 'Okay', 'getting', 'chest', 'once', 'things', 'start', 'line', 'up', 'really', 'got', 'very', 'well', 'got', 'zombie', 'So', 'not', 'bad', 'made', 'film', 'not', 'anyway', 'got', 'ta', 'have', 'high', 'patience', 'ability', 'get', 'where', 'want', 'be', 'here']",N/A

That's right four bills to do nothing but eat strangers food.Sound to good to be true?Well to me it sounds retarded.I just can't follow the logic in this movie at all.Now here a nice spoiler alert for those of you who may still wish to rent this...go rent it and stop reading this.For the rest who are like well if I had an idea of what this movie is about maybe I'd rent it and don't mind a spoiler here it is:The sick boy is a ZOMBIE!!! WOW that's original.That's right another low budget zombie movie which means it has all been done before and then done again.Hey five star people what would you rate a movie that is actually good..like a thousand stars?I mean if by your standards this is a five then a good movie like let's say District 9 must be in the triple digits.Seriously, you could probalby live not having seen this movie...

The film utilizes those cheap voice enhancers normally used for demonically possessed people. The whole scene of Lucy driving in a car listening to hip-hop was a waste.
