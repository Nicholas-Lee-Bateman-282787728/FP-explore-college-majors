343288,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302878616,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","As a young boy, `The Sandlot' was one of those films I just couldn't get enough of.  When you are a child it doesn't matter that a film you love has no real point or plot or anything to say.  A group of boys bond over baseball and the mishap adventure of retrieving a Babe Ruth signed baseball from the drooling jaws of `the beast' next door.  That's basically it, and yet there is something special and quietly beautiful about the whole thing.  This simple yet straightforward story tugs at the fiber of `being a boy' and is the perfect graduation from animated `kid films' to the world of live action films.  As an adult, I can't say that this film is as joyous, but fond memories and nostalgic emotions make me slightly bias towards this film.  It isn't a great film for all, but coming from a kid who never even cared for sports, this captures the joys of youth and adolescence and the innocence of childish adventure at the perfect pace for your young ones.What isn't perfect for young ones is the language.  I'm sorry, and I'm not trying to be a prude, but I don't want my children learning at a young age to repeat such language, and we're not talking about the minor curse words found often in PG rated films.  I had a similar problem trying to watch `The Goonies' with my kids.  This is the type a great family film marred by a few too many adult words.  That's why it's great to have a DVR, for when the film is aired in `edited form' on ABC Family.And yet, it appears that those words are unavoidable in film today (I'm even finding them in the children's books I've been getting for the kids) and so we have to learn to work around it.  It's hard to cast judgment on a film because of the content when the film is suitable for some and not for all, and any parent should investigate and know of the content of a film before subjecting their children to it (something I'm learning as I go along).  So, I'm not going to take off any points for the language.  It never bothered me as a kid, but as a parent I find myself more sensitive.Funny how those things work.",4,"Boys, baseball and the beast...",1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2073,"['young', 'boy', 'Sandlot', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'When', 'are', 'child', ""n't"", 'matter', 'film', 'love', 'real', 'point', 'plot', 'anything', 'say', 'group', 'boys', 'bond', 'baseball', 'mishap', 'adventure', 'retrieving', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'signed', 'baseball', 'drooling', 'jaws', 'beast', 'next', 'door', 'basically', 'yet', 'something', 'special', 'quietly', 'beautiful', 'whole', 'thing', 'simple', 'yet', 'straightforward', 'story', 'tugs', 'fiber', 'being', 'boy', 'perfect', 'graduation', 'animated', 'kid', 'films', 'world', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'adult', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'as', 'joyous', 'fond', 'memories', 'nostalgic', 'emotions', 'make', 'slightly', 'bias', 'towards', 'film', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'coming', 'kid', 'who', 'never', 'even', 'cared', 'sports', 'joys', 'youth', 'adolescence', 'innocence', 'childish', 'adventure', 'perfect', 'pace', 'young', 'ones.What', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'young', 'ones', 'language', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'prude', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'children', 'learning', 'young', 'age', 'repeat', 'such', 'language', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'minor', 'curse', 'words', 'found', 'often', 'PG', 'rated', 'films', 'had', 'similar', 'problem', 'trying', 'watch', 'Goonies', 'kids', 'type', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'marred', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'adult', 'words', 'why', 'great', 'have', 'DVR', 'when', 'film', 'aired', 'edited', 'form', 'ABC', 'Family.And', 'yet', 'words', 'are', 'unavoidable', 'film', 'today', ""'m"", 'even', 'finding', 'children', 'books', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'kids', 'so', 'have', 'learn', 'work', 'hard', 'cast', 'judgment', 'film', 'content', 'when', 'film', 'suitable', 'not', 'parent', 'should', 'investigate', 'know', 'content', 'film', 'subjecting', 'children', 'something', ""'m"", 'learning', 'go', 'along', 'So', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'take', 'off', 'points', 'language', 'never', 'bothered', 'kid', 'parent', 'find', 'more', 'sensitive.Funny', 'how', 'things', 'work']",N/A

343294,A103EXN5Q7HX6Z,6302878616,"BENJ1969 ""BENJ1969""","[1, 1]","This movie is essentially me and my friends growing up in the early 70s. Just like the Bad News Bears, while baseball is center which both stories evolve around, it's about more than that. It's about growing up, innocence of youth, and summer's spent when the only concerns about the future is when school starts again. Like the main cast members, every day we waited for who would start the chain of calls to wake everyone up to play ball at the nearby grade school lot. And with some variations, we spent the time not playing ball doing the same exact things these guys do. This movie is about love of baseball, and why so many cling to it: in addition to the love of the sport, it's the memories the sport evokes for many who played it. Until current times when organized leagues are everywhere and year round training facilities abound, the main memories baseball centered around was our summer vacations, our last years of innocence with no worries or obligations that adulthood would soon bring, whether we liked it or not. Which is kind of the synopsis that ""Smalls,"" the movies main character, makes at the movies end as an adult. How things changed as time move on, but how ""that"" summer will always be the best. Any 40something or older can fully relate to that sentiment. Which is why I think the viewers' age proportion is widely spread.

It deals with the innocence of youth and  how baseball unites people regardless of ability, race or social  status.Scotty Smalls is a new kid in town and he is very shy.  He  doesn't know how to talk to the other neighbor kids, until he sees them  playing baseball in a dusty sandlot.  Having no ability, yet desperate to  make friends, he grabs his old glove and joins the game (they need a ninth  player).  Unfortunately, he is no good and is nearly booted off the team.  However, their best player, Benny Rodriguez, takes pity on him and begins  teaching him the basics of baseball.There is really no plot to this  movie.  This movie is about LIFE, so it is broken down in small vignettes  episodes.  Some are humorous (like the swimming pool scene and the Ghost  story scene), some are poignant (the 4th of July) and some just down right  silly (Getting the ball back from Kujo).  However, they all mesh together  well with the rights of baseball and make the Similie that Baseball is Life  very much true.The kids, mostly unknowns, are very good as a unit.  They  all have interesting nicknames like &quot;Ham&quot;, &quot;Squints&quot;,  &quot;Yeah-Yeah&quot; and  &quot;Repeater&quot;.  They all seem like they  are all truly close to each other.The ending is a little saccarine, but  with it's sweetness comes some poignancy.  It's nice to see that Smalls  continues on (and learns to love) with a game that has helped provide his  childhood memories.Rating: B-",3,Good Entertainment for the whole family.,965952000,"08 11, 2000",2000,1649,"['three', 'baseball', 'movie', 'kids', 'others', 'being', 'ANGELS', 'IN', 'THE', 'OUTFIELD', 'ROOKIE', 'THE', 'YEAR', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'other', 'Sandlot', 'far', 'best', 'innocence', 'youth', 'how', 'baseball', 'people', 'regardless', 'ability', 'race', 'social', 'status.Scotty', 'Smalls', 'new', 'kid', 'town', 'very', 'shy', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'talk', 'other', 'neighbor', 'kids', 'playing', 'baseball', 'dusty', 'sandlot', 'Having', 'ability', 'yet', 'desperate', 'make', 'friends', 'grabs', 'old', 'glove', 'game', 'need', 'ninth', 'player', 'Unfortunately', 'good', 'nearly', 'booted', 'off', 'team', 'However', 'best', 'player', 'Benny', 'Rodriguez', 'pity', 'teaching', 'basics', 'baseball.There', 'really', 'plot', 'movie', 'movie', 'LIFE', 'broken', 'down', 'small', 'vignettes', 'episodes', 'are', 'humorous', 'swimming', 'pool', 'scene', 'Ghost', 'story', 'scene', 'are', 'poignant', '4th', 'July', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'silly', 'Getting', 'ball', 'back', 'Kujo', 'However', 'mesh', 'together', 'well', 'rights', 'baseball', 'make', 'Similie', 'Baseball', 'Life', 'very', 'much', 'true.The', 'kids', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'unit', 'have', 'interesting', 'nicknames', 'quot', 'Ham', 'quot', 'quot', 'Squints', 'quot', 'quot', 'Yeah-Yeah', 'quot', 'quot', 'Repeater', 'quot', 'seem', 'are', 'truly', 'close', 'other.The', 'ending', 'little', 'saccarine', 'sweetness', 'poignancy', 'nice', 'see', 'Smalls', 'love', 'game', 'helped', 'provide', 'childhood', 'memories.Rating', 'B-']",N/A

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 3]","It is the summer of 1962, and Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry), his mother (Karen Allen), and his stepfather, Bill (Denis Leary) have moved to a new neighborhood. Scotty is kind of an egghead and has a hard time making friends. His mother tells him to get out and make friends, get in trouble even. Bill, his stepfather, could teach him how to play baseball, but he is too busy. Luckily, Benny Rodriguez (Mike Vitar) asks him to play with their sandlot baseball team. Scotty has a lot to learn about baseball, and the other kids don't want to let him play:Ham Porter: Benny, why'd you bring that kid?Benny: Because he makes nine of us.Yeah Yeah: Yeah yeah, so does my sister, but I didn't bring her along!They don't keep score or anything, the game just goes on and on, the perfect game--unless someone hits the ball over the junkyard fence where 'The Beast,' dwells. One day Benny hits the ball so hard that the cover tears off. It seems like a sign that something great is going to happen, but they are fresh out of baseballs. Scotty gets the ball that his stepfather keeps in his study, but he is unaware of its value, as it is signed by baseball legend Babe Ruth. He hits his first homerun over the fence, but his victory is shortlived when he realizes that in order to get the ball back before his stepfather misses it, he will have to confront 'The Beast,' the biggest and meanest junkyard dog who has ever lived.Smalls: I was gonna put the ball back.Squints: But it was signed by Babe Ruth!Smalls: Yeah, you keep telling me that! Who is she?Ham Porter: WHAT? WHAT?Kenny: The sultan of swat!Bertram: The king of crash!Timmy: The colossus of clout!Tommy: The colossus of clout!All: BABE RUTH!Ham Porter: THE GREAT BAMBINO!Smalls: Oh my god! You mean that's the same guy?The Sandlot is a classic story of baseball, friends, and dogs. It is much loved by my sister and her daughters, who often quote from it, especially this scene with Scotty Smalls and Hamilton 'Ham' Porter (Patrick Renna):Ham Porter: Hey, Smalls, you wanna s'more?Smalls: Some more of what?Ham Porter: No, do you wanna s'more?Smalls: I haven't had anything yet, so how can I have some more of nothing?Ham Porter: You're killing me Smalls! These are s'more's stuff! Alrite now pay attention. First you take the graham, you stick the chocolate on the graham. Then you roast the 'mallow. When the 'mallows flaming... you stick it on the chocolate. Then cover with the other end. Then you scarf. Kind of messy, but good!This movie was also kind of messy, but good. It was real good. It was the Babe Ruth of baseball movies. Written and directed by David M. Evans, he also provides voice over narration. I could have sworn that it was James Denton who plays the plumber, Mike Delfino on The Desperate Housewives TV program, but it wasn't. David M. Evans did a great job on this film. Chauncey Leopardi was hillarious as Michael 'Squints' Palledorous. Marty York was also very funny as  Alan 'Yeah-Yeah' McClennan. James Earl Jones played the owner of the junkyard, Mr. Mertle. The kids think he is the meanest man who ever lived, but let's just say that his bark is worse than his bite. There is a great scene at the community pool, and Marlee Shelton plays the lifeguard, Wendy Peffercorn.Squints: I've been coming here every summer of my adult life, and every summer there she is oiling and lotioning, lotioning and oiling... smiling. I can't take this no more!When the boys are in the pool watching Wendy Peffercorn, the dialog: ""She don't know what she's doing"" and the answer ""Yes she does, she knows exactly what she's doing"" is the same as in a similar scene in Cool Hand Luke (1967). Also a great scene when they challenge another baseball team, one that actually has uniforms, to a game. Did I mention that red haired, freckled, chubby Patrick Renna was a natural born comic as Ham Porter? His distracting chatter while he plays catcher in the big game is classic.Ham Porter: PLAY BALL! Hurry up, batter. This better be a short game, I gotta get home for lunch.[Pitcher pitches and the batter fails to even swing]Ham Porter: Haha, that's one.[cuts to new pitch]Ham Porter: [to the batter] You know, if my dog was as ugly as you. I'd shave his butt and tell him to walk backwards.[cuts to new pitch]Ham Porter: Here it comes, it's coming, I tell ya. STRIKE THREE[Porter puts the batter off, he swings and misses]Ham Porter: YOU'RE OUT![cuts to new pitch]Ham Porter: Is that your sister out there in left field, naked?

This movie is always billed as a great kids/family movie, but there's more bad language in it than you might expect (including several ""s"" words) - beyond what's in many PG movies.  There's also a bit of an emphasis on sexuality - including a reference to Playboy.  I know that's understandable for boys in this age range, but not everyone will necessarily want their 9 year old watching this - thinking it's such a ""great kids movie"" as so many reviews portray it as. Whenever someone like myself brings up problematic content, the response is often that the rating tells parents they should be careful (PG).  And while that's true, PG covers a broad spectrum.  I just watched another kids baseball movie called The Perfect Game, which is also rated PG and has NO bad language (that I heard) or sexual overtones (it's also a great movie).  Personally, even as an adult, I think The Sandlot would be a more enjoyable film without this unnecessary content, but I know that some people don't/won't agree or care.

An intelligent boy (an egghead), he lacks certain abilities most boys have, like knowing how to catch and throw a ball, any basic baseball rules, or who's the Great Bambino.  The movie does an excellent job in providing just enough depth into these characters to provide a sense of the family dynamic given that Allen and Leary have limited screen time.  In attempting to join a neighborhood pick up game, Scotty's lack of rudimentary baseball skills is made painfully apparent, to which all the boys except Bennie, the best player of the bunch, let their derisive comments fly.  Bennie, feeling a bit sorry for the new kid, gives Scotty a couple of tips and a little extra help in a well hit fly ball that gives Scotty a measure of confidence and helps bring him into the gang.  Once Scotty's accepted into the group the movie delves into a plot involving a priceless baseball and a local dog with a mythical reputation.  What I really liked was how all the boys came together to help a friend in need, and it was an automatic response.  If someone in the circle needs help, the group rallies around, regardless, as they would have done the same for any other member.  While a seemingly natural trait in children (atleast in this movie), it seems to be one that becomes lost as we grow older, as seen in Scotty's step dad and his reluctance to play catch with Scotty because he has too much work and doesn't have the time.  What is so great about this movie is while it's set in the 50's, the story appeals to most anyone.  Whether or not we all had that one great summer or just fond remembrances of childhood friends and activities in general, the movie serves to help recall days when things were simple, and summers were made up of endless possibilities.  While watching this movie, I thought about friends I had when I was a kid, phrases we used, nicknames, activities, etc.No real extras on this disc, but a great presentation of a wonderful movie.  My favorite part involved one of the boys called Squints, a smaller boy with great, big glasses, and scene with curvaceous, older, female lifeguard at the local pool.",5,"""This is baseball.

That's exactly the age I was in 1963. The setting is a dusty, rutted old ballfield where the kids constantly practice hitting &amp; fielding. They have a true love of the game. They also have a sense of history. In 1963, Koufax was having a phenominal year, Maury Wills had stolen 104 bases the prior year, and Maris had hit 61 homers two years earlier. However, the player these kids talk about and dream about is Babe Ruth, the bambinio, the sultan of swat. A new kid to this southern California neighborhood lets his friends use his stepfather's baseball when they lose the one the have. However, this naive neophyte has no idea what this ball is .. it is autographed by the Babe himself. Of course, the ball gets hit over the fence to where a beast (a large, mean, killer dog)lives. The movie then centers on the efforts to retrieve the ball when the rest of the team realizes what this ball was.

It's a frame story narrated by an adult who recalls one extraordinary childhood summer and a very special best friend. However, instead of a quest to find a dead body, it's a signed Babe Ruth baseball the kids are after, and what stands in their way isn't a bunch of older hoodlums with switchblades, but an enormous junkyard dog they call ""The Beast.""More than coming of age, The Sandlot is about baseball . . . or the love of baseball. It's 1962, and in a sleepy L.A. suburb newcomer Scotty Smalls is feeling isolated and friendless until the boy across the street befriends him. Benny is the best player among a ragtag group of kids who do nothing but play baseball, except for taking an occasional swim. The other guys ridicule the diminutive Smalls for his lack of athleticism, but with Benny's support he gains acceptance. And what begins as an idyllic summer ends up a legendary one after a prized ball gets whacked over the fence into The Beast's abode.It's a funny, fun film that holds plenty of family appeal because it has a wholesome Norman Rockwell vibe, and, as with any good sports film, you don't have to love the game to love the film.

The point of view, for one thing, is that of the main character retelling the events of a summer of his youth, giving the narration both the wry perspective of age AND the exaggeration of youthful memories.  The scenes of boys in clubhouses, telling ghost stories or &quot;intitiating&quot; the new boy in town, are hilarious, as are the baseball sequences.The story is actually fairly thin, involving a legendary mean junkyard dog who eats any ball that goes over the fence.

Scotty has just moved to California with his mom (Karen Allen) and stepfather (Denis Leary).  Upon moving in to their new home, Scotty's mom tells him that she wants him to make some new friends instead of staying inside all of the time.  One day, Scotty comes across a group of boys plaing baseball in a sandlot.  He goes over to watch, but he changes his mind.  He's embarrassed because he doesn't know how to throw or catch.  He asks his stepfather to help, but Scotty doesn't get any better.One of the boys at the sandlot noticed Scotty.  He introduces himself as Benny (Mike Vitar) and proceeds to show Scotty the finer points of baseball.  In no time at all, Scotty is catching, throwing, hitting, and has become a part of the team.  These nine boys become inseparable, spending their days playing baseball, swimming, riding bikes, and doing the things most grade school age boys do on summer vacation.  The boys do have one problem in their lives; the beast.  The beast is a large dog that lives behind the fence which surrounds the sandlot where the boys play baseball.  Every time someone hits a ball over the fence, it is automatically assumed that the ball is lost forever, because no one has ever ventured into the yard to get their ball back.  Such a case arises for Scotty and his friends.One day while playing ball, someone hit the ball over the fence.  Scotty volunteered to go home and get another one.  He brought it back to the field and the game began again.  Scotty himself ends up hitting the ball he brought over the fence, but the ball was autographed by Babe Ruth.  The boys try all different kinds of ideas to get the valuable ball back, but nothing seems to work.  One night, Benny has a dream about Babe Ruth and getting the ball back.  Babe tells Benny that he must go into the yard to retrieve the ball.  Will Benny Survive his encounter with the beast?This is an excellent movie.  It takes me back to my own childhood when I would do the same thing as the boys in the movie; play baseball from early morning until late in the afternoon.  I thought the story was exceptional.  It was fun watching the boys learn about life along the way as well.  The scene where ""Squints"" fakes drowning and is revived by the cute lifeguard was one of the best scenes in the movie.  Benny overcoming his own uncertainties as he prepared to retrieve the Babe Ruth ball was equally as good.  I'm a huge baseball fan and I've seen such classics as ""Eight Men Out"", ""The Natural"" and ""Field of Dreams"".  ""The Sandlot"" ranks with these as being one of the best baseball movies I've ever seen.  I highly recommend this movie.  If you're a baseball fan like me or if you enjoy watching movies about friendship and growing up, then this movie is one you won't want to miss.

How often I have loved to live  once more through that outstanding concluding cameo performance by the  incomparable James Earl Jones, which more than makes up for the one  really  weak characterization (Babe Ruth) in the film ! How well I recall with  fondness my own anticipation of invincability when I first took my first  pair of 'P.F. Flyers' out of the box!This is just a great movie! The  director knows how to make these boys do what they do best...just be junior  high kids! The film is narrated in the 'Wonder Years' format, and if  anything does it better than Wonder Years--this is it! There are just a few  'choice' words used, so I have to show the edited version to my 7th graders  in the classroom. I had thought it would be a 'guys only' movie (so much  baseball), but it has universal appeal.Who among us has not had to face  the one thing we are so inept at--just like 'Smalls' did? Do any of us not  look back upon our early teenage years and see things just slightly 'larger  than life'? The director took the film in this direction, and the 'just  larger than life' approach works to perfection! The film is also full of  great lines, (e.g., &quot;...heroes are remembered, kid, but legends never  die.&quot;).All the warmth of the Summer of '62 came back to me as I  watched Sandlot.

He's still getting used to his new step-father and doesn't know how to catch or throw a baseball, and to make matters worse doesn't even know who the ""Great Bambino"" is.  Some of the neighborhood kids gather every day at ""the sandlot,"" their own personal baseball kingdom, and he tries to casually join them.  But it isn't until Bennie Rodriguez, the best and most ardent player of them all, asks him to join and gives him the confidence he needs to learn to play.  It makes for the best summer of his life and lifelong friendships, especially when he unknowingly uses a baseball signed by Babe Ruth, and hits it over the fence into the yard of ""The Beast,"" a huge baseball-eating dog.This is one of those classic baseball-worship movies on a par with ""Field of Dreams"" and other favorites.  Plus, it's a great family movie with few profanities - it's funny and the things the kids do and say resonate with everyone whether or not you grew up playing another sport or in another time period.  My kids love to watch it regularly, and I'm impressed with how good some of the children actors are (James Earl Jones also has a bit part at the end).

I loved it then, when I was 12, and I still love it today when I'm 21. This is a story about a boy named Scott Smalls who just moved to town and has no friends. He is also interested in baseball but has never played. His stepfather keeps promising him he'll teach him how to play catch but never seems to have time until one day when Scott's mom convinces him to take a few minutes from his busy day to teach him. It is not easy at all because Scott seems to not have much, if any, athletic talent.The next day after he is taught how to throw and catch he's tested when the town superstar athlete, Benny ""The Jet"" Rodriguez, who also just happens to be his next door neighbor, invites him to play baseball with him and his friends. They are eight kids who are just awesome at baseball. They just play for fun all day long, every day. This story is mainly about an incident that these guys get into that is started when Scott steals a baseball from his step-father's trophy room. This is no ordinary baseball, it's a ball signed by Babe Ruth! The Babe Ruth. And they actually play a game with it!  That is until Scott happens to hit his first ever ball over the fence and into the yard of the biggest, meanest dog in the town!

THE SANDLOT takes place in the '60s and it's about a kid, Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry), who moves to a new neighborhood and doesn't know anybody - and all at the same time, trying to get used to his new stepfather. He's not really good at sports, but his stepfather is trying to teach him how to play Baseball even though he is very busy. Scotty soon comes across a group of kids who love the game of Baseball and are really good, while playing fo the love of it and are not on a real team. They play Baseball at this deserted Sandlot every day during the summer. Scotty finally gets the courage to ask if he can join in.

They also learn that the huge St. Bernard who lives in the house behind the Sandlot may not be a monster after all, when Scotty accidentally hits their only ball into the yard of the St. Bernard.

First time I seen the movie since I can't remember when and it's just like I remember when I watched it when I was a kid during the 90s.  For those who haven't seen this movie or maybe don't remember it well, it's about a kid who moved to a new town just around the time that summer starts then has to try to make friends before the next school year starts.  While it's a baseball theme based family film, at least of that of what it was like during the 1960s and all that.  Eight kids play baseball at a little 'sandlot' and finally get a ninth person to have a whole team on field anyways, but whenever one hits a homerun into where what is known as 'The Beast' the day is done.  That is until one time one is brave enough to go over there. This was one of the few baseball movies that I know I could go about watching without much of a problem since I don't go about watching movies about the sport that much.

Set in the 1950's or so in a normal suburban town, Tom Guirney plays a short, shy kid who has just moved to the new neighborhood.  He has always struggled with making friends, but eventually he gets involved with a group who love to play the good ol' American pasttime.The group (which consists of many hilarious and memorable youngsters) go through many trials and tribulations together--chewing their first slab of tobacco while riding on a devastating roller-coaster, giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to one of the hottest girls in the history of the world, retreiving a special Babe Ruth autographed baseball that has been snatched up by the child-eating neighborhood pooch, and trying to beat the stuck-up traveling baseball team.  When it is all said and done, &quot;The Sandlot&quot; is an above average tale of the joys of childhood and using the great game of baseball as its playing field.

But what about it makes it so irresistable?For one thing, it's pure fun. Scotty Smalls is new to the neighborhood, and as his stepfather leaves for a week on a business trip, Scotty loses his stepfather's priceless Babe Ruth-signed baseball, thinking it was just another baseball. Seeing him and all his new-found friends go completely over the top to retrieve the ball from the neighbor's giant beast of a dog is sure to prove a great time.Not to give too much away, but there's another awesome scene at the city pool where Squints fakes drowning just to make out with his crush, Wendy the lifeguard! You must see the look on his face right before he does so!At the end of the movie, when the plot is resolved and all is well, the movie catches up with modern times (as it is set in 1962). The older Scotty Smalls is the narrator and tells how each of his friends resulted in their careers and such. It may have been done before, but for me, it's a technique that never,ever gets old!Aside the main plot, there are quite a few other situations the characters get themselves into, including the summer carnival and a sleepover in the treehouse (a scene which sports the immortal, ""You're killing me, Smalls!"" line, and a so-ridiculous-it's-awesome campfire tale of The Beast). In addition, there's a baseball game against a Little League team which returns to the baseball overview of the movie.""The Sandlot"", as previously mentioned, is an absolute joyride full of laughs, great, powerful, dramatic moments (especially in Benny's dream) and is a very nostalgic movie that will leave you feeling great, as a great movie should.

It's nostalgic almost in the vain of the coming of age stance of STAND BY ME, but it is not as heavy handed. It's positive and fun. The plot revolves around a newcomer,Scotty Smalls(Tom Guiry)to a 60's California neighborhood. Scotty is trying to figure out and start a relationship with new stepdad (Denis Leary), and he is introduced to sandlot baseball from the neighborhood boys. At first glance, it looked like the film would be the neighborhood boys vs. the new kid on the block. Fortunately, it didn't go this route. When Scotty doesn't know a thing about baseball (not even the basics of throwing and catching) he is ostracized right away. However, this is quickly resolved. One of the boys, Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez (Mike Vitar) gives Scotty simple advice and confidence and within moments, he is accepted into sandlot baseball by the other boys and, playing the game of baseball. The scene is done well, showing the great universality of Baseball in which anyone, young and old, can learn to play the game. The rest of the film are various vignetts of summer fun for these coming of age pre-teens and their friendship and comraderie. All with sandlot baseball as the backdrop. Also, part of story involves a legendary junkyard dog behind the sandlot's centerfield wall, harboring all the ""homerun"" balls. When a certain important baseball is hit over the fence,the rest of the film shows the gang trying to get the ball away from the dog in various ways. The film is fun and nostalgic and the cast of the neighborhood/sandlot boys are all likeable.
