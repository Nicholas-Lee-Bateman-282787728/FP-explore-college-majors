A lot of people say it was a crummy, shoddy movie and I guess so, (I have not seen it in maybe 15 years) so why so expensive??? I would like to own it.

The movie is not particularly accurate historically, but Art Carney's characterization of Harry Truman, makes the film. For those of us living in sight of Mt. Ranier, another semi-active volcano, it makes for a thought provoking movie.I love trivia so I'll share a few intriguing facts that I've read:  Washington state has cornered the U.S. market on volcanos, we have five active ones. Geologists predict Mt. Ranier will blow catastrophically in the foreseeable future (1 chance in 6, during our lifetime). The lahar (a Hawaiian word), is an avalanche of mud and ash which will race down the nearby Nisqually river valley at freeway speed. Not if mind you...when. Reaching south Seattle, the lahar will erase a quarter of a million people and there may be no warning whatsoever. One geologist was quoted saying that of all the worlds volcanos, it's Mt. Ranier that scares him most. Yikes! It's no wonder we have to take the lessons of Mt. St. Helen seriously.Movies about apocalyptic event's have always held a facination for most of us. Just ignore the fictionalized stuff and focus on the true events. This movie does a pretty good job of that. One thing to note, this film has a slightly soft focus and muddy colors. Almost certainly, it's a second or third generation print. Also, there were several scenes in the film where I could hear annoying flaws in the soundtrack.
