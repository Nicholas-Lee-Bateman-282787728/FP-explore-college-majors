The series has always focused on the character of Morse and the relationship between the two detectives, but this episode brings both these strands home beautifully.Then, at the end, Lewis speaks to the daughter who had to sell the family silver we saw in the opening shot (to pay off a blackmailer).

The adaptation of Colin Dexter's ""The Remorseful Day"" has left a stinking corpse of what was a masterful story, an exquisite exposition of the ""Parsifal"" like heart of Endeavour Morse. The culprits? Rebecca Eaton and her doltish cadre of American PBS writers who have distinguished themselves in missing the entire point of the book.Mind you, if you have not read the book, you'll enjoy this video. All the great elements are there: John Thaw essays Morse brilliantly, Kevin Whately turns in a terrific performance as Lewis, although he is compelled to deliver a totally ridiculous and melodramatic ""Morse is dead!"" proclamation. He acquits himself and moves on. All the supporting players, the family intrigues, the score, the filmwork - all executed brilliantly. So, you'd have little reason to suspect something is awry.But there is and it is as great a disservice to a book as I can ever remember. Now, that argument can be made about a lot of transfers from book to film, but in this case, and with this series, which has been so faithful to Dexter's works, it is just incomprehensible. I can only conclude that it is due to the American fascination with smoothing out any sense of nuance in order to champion the easily digestible. I should tell you where the crime lies, but that's not fair to anyone who really would enjoy what actually happened in the story. Suffice it to say that much of the story turns on the Parsifal legend, and how in fact the pure of heart are vindicated with vision of the grail, whatever form that grail may take. So, Endeavour Morse is vindicated in a coda that lingers with you long, long after you put the book down. Throughout the film, there are efforts made to quote not only Wagner's theme for ""Parsifal"", but Han Knappertsbusch's direction of it in the 1962 score. Why? Well, Morse makes reference to it in discussion with Lewis, and it fits with the T.S Elliott quote that includes the title of the story, plus Knappertsbusch was himself the most Morse like of conductors in every way imaginable, and in 1962 was well aware that he was dying. So with all of the main clues in tact, why on earth Eaton and her merry band of nitwits elected to miss the point is not only unimaginable but unforgiveable.Certainly, enjoy this DVD for what it is. I assure you that if you read the book, you will want, as I want, to grab the murderous crutch and shove it where PBS don't broadcast. The most heinous murder in Oxford was committed in Boston. Shame on Eaton. Perhaps one day Dexter will insist on a reshoot, although Thaw is not well, and Whately may have no interest in any further casting as Lewis. Somehow, the record, as it is in the book, needs to be set straight.",4,A REMORSEFUL ADAPTATION,1027036800,"07 19, 2002",2002,2766,"['been', 'murder', 'here', 'not', 'one', 'think', 'adaptation', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'Remorseful', 'Day', 'left', 'stinking', 'corpse', 'what', 'was', 'masterful', 'story', 'exquisite', 'exposition', 'Parsifal', 'heart', 'Endeavour', 'Morse', 'culprits', 'Rebecca', 'Eaton', 'doltish', 'cadre', 'American', 'PBS', 'writers', 'who', 'have', 'distinguished', 'missing', 'entire', 'point', 'book.Mind', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'video', 'great', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'John', 'Thaw', 'Morse', 'brilliantly', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Lewis', 'compelled', 'deliver', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'melodramatic', 'Morse', 'dead', 'proclamation', 'moves', 'supporting', 'players', 'family', 'intrigues', 'score', 'filmwork', 'executed', 'brilliantly', 'So', ""'d"", 'have', 'little', 'reason', 'suspect', 'something', 'awry.But', 'as', 'great', 'disservice', 'book', 'can', 'ever', 'remember', 'Now', 'argument', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'lot', 'transfers', 'book', 'film', 'case', 'series', 'been', 'so', 'faithful', 'Dexter', 'works', 'just', 'incomprehensible', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'due', 'American', 'fascination', 'smoothing', 'out', 'sense', 'nuance', 'order', 'champion', 'easily', 'digestible', 'should', 'tell', 'where', 'crime', 'not', 'fair', 'anyone', 'who', 'really', 'would', 'enjoy', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'story', 'Suffice', 'say', 'much', 'story', 'Parsifal', 'legend', 'how', 'fact', 'pure', 'heart', 'are', 'vindicated', 'vision', 'grail', 'form', 'grail', 'may', 'take', 'So', 'Endeavour', 'Morse', 'vindicated', 'coda', 'long', 'long', 'put', 'book', 'down', 'film', 'are', 'efforts', 'made', 'quote', 'not', 'only', 'Wagner', 'theme', 'Parsifal', 'Han', 'Knappertsbusch', 'direction', '1962', 'score', 'Why', 'Well', 'Morse', 'reference', 'discussion', 'Lewis', 'T.S', 'Elliott', 'quote', 'title', 'story', 'Knappertsbusch', 'was', 'most', 'Morse', 'conductors', 'way', 'imaginable', '1962', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'was', 'dying', 'main', 'clues', 'tact', 'why', 'earth', 'Eaton', 'merry', 'band', 'nitwits', 'elected', 'miss', 'point', 'not', 'only', 'unimaginable', 'unforgiveable.Certainly', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'what', 'assure', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'want', 'want', 'grab', 'murderous', 'crutch', 'shove', 'where', 'PBS', 'do', ""n't"", 'broadcast', 'most', 'heinous', 'murder', 'Oxford', 'was', 'committed', 'Boston', 'Shame', 'Eaton', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'Dexter', 'will', 'insist', 'reshoot', 'Thaw', 'not', 'well', 'Whately', 'may', 'have', 'interest', 'further', 'casting', 'Lewis', 'Somehow', 'record', 'book', 'be', 'set', 'straight']",N/A

This is his last episode and you should see 'The Wench is Dead' episode first.  Morse is ill; he has been on medical leave because of his stomach ulcers.  His superior has taken over a case, but Morse comes back from leave and is assigned the case.  In the meantime he has been investigating it anyway, to Lewis' chagrin and barely-controlled anger.  The focus of the episode is their relationship; the case barely matters, except for the fact that the victim was one of Morse's nurses, one for whom he had special feelings.  It is a family story, with members of the family among the suspects in the mother's death.  It is also a family story in that it focuses on Morse's relationship with Lewis.  I won't spoil the ending, which is very powerful, but listen especially for Morse's final words . . . and then Lewis'.This is exhibit A for those who seek to demonstrate that genre fiction (here, genre fiction dramatized) can sometimes rise to the level of art.  In the case of Morse the art is achieved through the delineation of character and the study of human relationships.

It truly showed the amount of affection and respect shared between these two great men.This DVD comes with two features. One is the last episode, The Remorseful Day, and the other features a documentary titled The Last Morse. The Last Morse traces the beginnings of Morse, with clips of interviews with many of the main cast members, notably John Thaw and Kevin Whately, as well as author Colin Dexter whose works inspired the drama. There are also interviews with the actors who played Morse's love interests during the course of the show, as well as actors who portrayed villains. Though altogether brief (about 53 minutes), this documentary is well worth watching for Morse enthusiasts.The episode focuses on the investigation of the murder of a nurse, Yvonne Harrison, who had been found brutally murdered in her own home. Morse, who is in terrible physical shape due to his rapidly deteriorating health, is put back on the case after he returns from medical leave, much to the chagrin of DS Lewis, who is hoping to be promoted to Inspector and who is genuinely concerned about his superior's health. There is something Morse is not telling Lewis, and it is only much later that Lewis discovers what it is. Meanwhile, the list of suspects grows, as does the list of murdered victims.Morse and Lewis continue their investigation, working together as a team, and it was bittersweet watching this episode for I knew this was to be their last collaborative effort. How I will miss Inspector Morse, and God bless John Thaw's departed soul, may he rest in peace.
