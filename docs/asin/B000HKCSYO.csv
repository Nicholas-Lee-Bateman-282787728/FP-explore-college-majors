The reason why i nicked two stars is that it is a little annoying for adults to watch, like the annoying songs can stuck in your head, make you want to end it all.  Also, the main women is an intense person, which is fine.  Now, if you go in knowing these lesser qualities ahead of time, i think it can be a positive experience for any parent and their child.  If you are a musician and sensitive to bad music, i would run far away from this product.

The same segment repeats twice, then there's a lengthy introduction by Rachel Coleman.  I found it strange that the introduction that explains the process was placed in the middle rather than at the beginning, but it is what it is.  By the time I got to that part, I stopped watching (it was really long).  The actual signing segment is great, and it's one of the few things that has actually held my son's attention.  He's only 8 months now and we watched it a couple of times, so I don't expect him to sign back just yet.  I found it very helpful, and I continue to sign with him and hope that soon he will catch on.  It's great, it's interesting, catchy, and my son loves it, but I don't see the point of repeating the same segment over and over again.  That's what the rewind button is for.

The thing is, though, this is a very upbeat video with a lot of footage babies find engaging such as of dogs, cats, ocean, bugs, food,, etc. It's an entertaining interesting DVD for any baby and also gives them a sense of their own capabilities and place in the world because all the aforementioned footage is interspersed with shots of very cute babies trying out  different signs with varying degrees of success. The mood is very cheerful and Rachel his a terrific guide. The music, which appears to be original, is very good too. BTW, we also got ""My BMy Baby Can Talk - First Signsand like it, but not as much as this one.Update hundreds of viewings later:This is hands down--or up!--the best DVD for babies. Period. As in: there is no DVD our baby enjoys more. We don't particularly care about signing--she just loves it. And we love it too. After having watched it about a gazillion times--by popular demand of our baby--I don't see a single flaw or weak moment in it. It totally shines, has gotten us really interested in signing, and even has greater artistic value: when I view it it gives me a perspective on what it means to be a mother than is hard to come by in the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The footage is heartwarming, the music is far above average, Rachel the host is fantastic, the camera work is first-rate. They really have captured some special moments.

His communication was about that of an infant learning to point and fuss for what he wanted.  Intellectually he is very bright, so it was frustrating for both of us.  I did a lot of research on the best way to help him in his communication, and I found Baby Signing Time.  I cannot say enough good about this series!!!  My son is communicating!  Within the first TWO DAYS of owning the DVD, my son was already signing all of the signs on the DVD.  At meal time now he will sign for food or drink instead of crying.  He's happier, and it seems to be encouraging him to try new words.  While he is imitating signs (which he seems much more comfortable with) he is also occasionally repeating spoken words now too...something he never did!
