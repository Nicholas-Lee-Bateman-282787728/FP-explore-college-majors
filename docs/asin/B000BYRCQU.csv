Madelaine (Embeth Davidtz) is the cosmopolitan art dealer; George (Alessandro Nivola) is a passionate Southerner.  They head to North Carolina for one of her art deals and for a visit to his family.  They are a disfunctional family, including his louse of a brother, Johnny (Ben Mackenzie) and his colorful wife, Ashley (Amy Adams), who is soon expecting.  The father is withdrawn, and his mother is hyper-critical of others.  There is a clash in cultures, which Madelaine earnestly tries to hurdle without being condescending, yet she discovers her husband as a different person in his own milieu.  The contrasts and characterization are phenomenal, and Ashley and George are such lovable people, they make you want to cry.  The plot is and is not resolved, but the visit is satisfying enough to give a sense of closure.",5,Realistic Reunion,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,941,"['Junebug', 'tender', 'quirky', 'tale', 'two', 'lovers', 'who', 'meet', 'Chicago', 'art', 'exhibition', 'fall', 'love', 'marry', 'Madelaine', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'cosmopolitan', 'art', 'dealer', 'George', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'passionate', 'Southerner', 'head', 'North', 'Carolina', 'one', 'art', 'deals', 'visit', 'family', 'are', 'disfunctional', 'family', 'including', 'louse', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Ben', 'Mackenzie', 'colorful', 'wife', 'Ashley', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'soon', 'expecting', 'father', 'withdrawn', 'mother', 'hyper-critical', 'others', 'clash', 'cultures', 'Madelaine', 'earnestly', 'hurdle', 'being', 'condescending', 'husband', 'different', 'person', 'own', 'milieu', 'contrasts', 'characterization', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'Ashley', 'George', 'are', 'such', 'lovable', 'people', 'make', 'want', 'cry', 'plot', 'not', 'resolved', 'visit', 'satisfying', 'enough', 'give', 'sense', 'closure']",Junebug

Certain aspects of them tug me in both directions. I'll say firmly that the acting was top notch. The settings looked incredibly familiar. The cinematography was innovative and interesting. Unfortunately, there was nothing to tie it all together. The point of view keeps changing and at inconsistent methods. Sometimes you get to hear what certain people are talking about and then it jumps to another person or group meanwhile the first situation is still playing on. The disjoint causes feeling like I'm too a person in the house but have no control over where my body is taking me. Certain realistic issues are brought up with no explanation or closure. I'm not saying that's bad film making, because it is very representative of what I see in real life. However, that's one of the things in life that I don't enjoy very much. To me, a sad ending is a story that's been cut short. I'm disappointed by the thematic cliff that Amy Adams' Ashley is left on after her meltdown at the hospital. All we are treated to after that is an inaudible outburst over the phone to her enigmatic brooding husband. I gave the movie an honest chance, but it delivered a great set of characters with no explanations.",3,On the top of the picket fence,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,1299,"['sometimes', 'come', 'movies', 'where', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'fence', 'like', 'not', 'Certain', 'aspects', 'tug', 'directions', ""'ll"", 'say', 'firmly', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'settings', 'looked', 'incredibly', 'familiar', 'cinematography', 'was', 'innovative', 'interesting', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'nothing', 'tie', 'together', 'point', 'view', 'keeps', 'changing', 'inconsistent', 'methods', 'Sometimes', 'get', 'hear', 'what', 'certain', 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'then', 'person', 'group', 'first', 'situation', 'still', 'playing', 'disjoint', 'feeling', ""'m"", 'too', 'person', 'house', 'have', 'control', 'where', 'body', 'taking', 'Certain', 'realistic', 'issues', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'explanation', 'closure', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'film', 'making', 'very', 'representative', 'what', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'However', 'one', 'things', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'sad', 'ending', 'story', 'been', 'cut', 'short', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'thematic', 'cliff', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Ashley', 'left', 'meltdown', 'hospital', 'are', 'treated', 'inaudible', 'outburst', 'phone', 'enigmatic', 'brooding', 'husband', 'gave', 'movie', 'honest', 'chance', 'delivered', 'great', 'set', 'characters', 'explanations']",Junebug
953384,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BYRCQU,A Customer,"[5, 8]","It's been a long time since George Johnston (Alessandro Nivola) has been back to his small town North Carolina roots. Now an urban sophisticate, complete with his beautiful and cultured new wife and art gallery owner Madeleine (Embeth Davidtz) the time has finally come for George to come home to his backwoods family, where baby showers and church socials generate the most enthusiasm. The trip is also being undertaken so that Madeleine can visit, and hopefully sign a contract with an eccentric local folk artist David Wark (Frank Hoyt Taylor) who paints lurid, racist, and sexual pictures, claiming that god has sent them to him.George's sister-in-law the nervy Ashley (Amy Adams) can't wait for their arrival, as she's anxious to check out the new bride. She constantly badgers her busybody mother Peg (Celia Weston) and her stoic, unresponsive father-in-law Eugene (Scott Wilson) about the new addition to the family. Heavily pregnant, Ashley spends her days reading baby manuals and trying to breath some life into her solemn and taciturn husband, Johnny (Benjamin McKenzie). But as the bubbly Ashley tries to be enthusiastic about the impending birth of their child, Johnny becomes even more morose and detached.The cultures are set to clash as the tall and sophisticated Madeleine begins to tell an eager Ashley all about her upbringing while Ashley's cynical, and wary family look on. Born in Japan, raised in Africa, and the daughter of a diplomat, Madeleine has had a life that Ashley could only dream of. Ashley demands to hear every little thing about her new sister-in-law and is enchanted by this unusual woman who kisses acquaintances on both cheeks and drops swear words in casual conversation.Ashley's an indefatigable optimist, who is thirsting to know about life. A high-school dropout - but only because she and Johnny were ""too much in love"" to finish - Ashley tries to maintain her sense of optimism, even though she's being starved of affection and attention. For his part, George would probably rather be somewhere else; it's not that he's ashamed of his family; it's just that he's reinvented himself, and while he shares comforting lunches with his dad, there's a sense that he just doesn't belong, he noticeably avoids his mom and brother, leaving Madeleine to fend for herself.Junebug is all about the sense of belonging, it's also a bittersweet morality tale about the importance of family, and whether where we come from can determine who we actually are. Kudos must certainly go to first time director Phil Morrison who has filled his film with finely observed and acute observations. In addition, Junebug contains such rich roster of eccentric characters, and while you see that Madeleine's urbane erudition stands out like a sore thumb amongst these unsophisticated simple folk, Morrison cleverly never condescends or looks down on anyone, whilst drawing such penetrating portraits.George is perhaps terrified that Madeleine will judge him for coming from such parochial roots, but to her credit, she fits in perfectly with her surroundings, buoyed perhaps by her newfound love, but also by the sense that the Johnson family is basically good, honest and decent. After all, George is introducing a wife who symbolizes his new life to the parents who remind him of the life he left behind, but part of George's journey is that he must rediscover the values he now deems too old-fashioned or undemanding to live by. Madeleine, meanwhile, discovers facets of George that she never knew.Whilst Junebug is not perfect - there are some awkward scene transitions, the editing is at times clumsy and erratic, and the film is a little too long - the astounding performances from its fine ensemble cast, and particularly the film's two female leads, more than make up for the film's shortcomings.Embeth Davidtz, an actress of immense range and formidable talents, manages to combine being the sympathetic stranger out of her element and the snobbish sophisticate with amazing dexterity and style; she's a classy girl who cleverly never condescends her surroundings. And Adams' performance, which should earn her a best supporting actress nomination - is complex and nuanced; you feel her vulnerability and pain, but her faith and her roots, and also her family, ultimately provide her with a sense of belonging that Madeleine, for all her cosmopolitanism, lacks.

953385,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000BYRCQU,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 13]","Being an ex-resident of Virginia, I saw this film as an opportunity to remember what life was like when I was living there.  I thought I would plunge deep into the roots of southern familiarity and witness scenes that would show realism and honesty.  Instead, what I saw with Junebug was a confusing story that attempted to ""glamorize"" the middle-class living of North Carolina.  When I use the word ""glamorize"", I do not mean it as this film is a glossy, picture-esque view of the south, but instead I use it as a term to describe Phil Morrison direction.  With jumpy camera work, inconsistent (and quite random) shots, a coupling of meaningless scenes, Phil Morrison, I believe, was afraid to go deeper into the hearts of the Junebug family.  I noticed this early in the film when Morrison threw explanation aside to allow more room for ""filler"" shots of what the ""south"" is supposed to look like.  He left quite a bit up to the audience to guess, hope, and assume, instead of giving us a straight story.  This was not a David Lynch film, but instead a story about family, so why not give us everything?  Why were certain characters doing this?  Why did George constantly leave the house?  Why was there so much bitterness and frustration surrounding this ""normal"" family?  Morrison may not agree, but I believe that if these questions were answered, there would have been a stronger sense of emotion and logic, instead of playing the ""independent film guessing game"".  Give us the characters, give us the truth, give us a stronger story and we will still support it.  Does Morrison not believe us?As I disappointingly watched Junebug's southern-esque story of family and culture unfold in front of my eyes, I couldn't help but wonder why Amy Adams was being handed so much praise for her work.  While she did have an interesting character in this film, she was not the most important in my eyes.  There was an actress working harder, giving us a bigger range of emotion, and really demonstrating to us her acting ability.  To me, the one that should be walking away with all of the accolades from this film would be Celia Weston.  Her role as Peg, the defensive matriarch of the family, was the only reason to watch this film.  Her expression, her eyes, her passion for her two sons was exactly what I think the director wanted from everyone in this film.  Director Phil Morrison was attempting to combine the chic structure of the art world, the unfamiliarities of southern living, the randomness of love, and the power of the family bond in one clear film.  He tried to do this with Junebug, but in my eyes, failed.  He did, however, create a powerful sensation with Celia Weston and her role as Peg, which translated into the better character of the film.  Amy Adams was good, but Celia Weston controlled the screen.  It was this dominating presence that could not have been played by anyone better.  The same could be said for Scott Wilson's portrayal of Eugene.  So much power and strength in his eyes alone carried this father figure deep into our hearts.  I just wish I could say the same for George, Madeleine, and Johnny, whom I thought were good, but could not compete with the two experienced actors.  If you have to watch Junebug, keep you eyes on both Weston and Wilson's roles, they alone will demonstrate the themes that Morrison was attempting to convey through the entire film.I will be the first to say that this was not an original view of southern life.  I did like the ideas that Morrison was attempting to bring to the surface, I just think he went about it all the wrong way.  I loved the randomness between Madeleine and George.  We are so used to having the pre-fabricated Hollywood romance that to have something as random and pure as this was exciting to watch.  I enjoyed the concept of learning about George and Madeleine as they were seemingly learning about themselves.  I thought that the cultural differences between the family and Madeleine's upbringing were going be bigger elements in this film.  Here is where I think I had the most trouble with Junebug.  Morrison had so many opportunities to grow a singular theme that he instead chose to confuse us by half-developing a dozen or so separate themes.  The speech by Amy Adams near the end of the film is a prime example of this half-developed theme.  What was the purpose behind that speech outside of winning Oscar votes?  Why was George there?  It seemed to only confuse me further because Morrison did not take the time to fully develop this to be the emotional tearjerker we were all hoping for.  Instead, the speech seemed random, stale and clich&eacute;d all at the same time.  This movie reminded me of the chaotic film known as In the Bedroom in which Todd Field used a similar structure to destroy his simple film.  That is the ultimate surroundings of Junebug.  It was supposed to be a film about simple people and about simple times, but due to the sloppy direction and forcing us to watch Amy Adams attempt to steal the screen, the simpleton style was completely corrupted.  North Carolina should not be proud of this film.Overall, I loved the performances of Celia Weston and Scott Wilson, but cannot say I enjoyed anything further.  I did not like the open-ended questions that Morrison placed before us because it distracted from the overall story.  I expected a bit more of a comedy, but sadly, it was weighted heavily on the dramatic side.  Amy Adams does not deserve the awards that she is being handed, while Celia Weston received the wrong end of the stick.  She should be up at the Oscars next month, not Adams.  Junebug was too artsy, too quiet, and too pushy to accurately depict life in North Carolina or anywhere in the south.  I believe that Morrison was too determined to shock the minds of audience members that he ultimately lost the power behind his film.  Questions are great to have with cinema, just do not make it your central theme.  You can watch this film once, but that may be pushing it a bit too far.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"Obviously influenced by someone's, you know, high-falutin' talkin'.",1140220800,"02 18,

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[3, 3]","There is something almost Chekhovian about this quiet drama of trapped people living frustrated lives and it's enlightened by a sensational performance by Amy Adams.It takes place in a snall town in North Carolina. George, the eldest son of the family, has escaped several years ago to Chicago and married stylish art gallery owner Madeleine (Embeth Davidtz) who boasts a British accent and an obnoxious, condescending manner. Madeleine has located a primitive folk artist whose work she is anxious to show and who lives a short distance from George's family. And so the visit takes place.George's family consists of his parents, his jealous, bitter, unsuccessful younger brother who in turn is married to the heavily-pregnant Ashley, played by Adams.The arrival of outsiders exposes nerves and fissures in the family, bringing all their unhappiness to the surface. Ashley is living a fantasy marriage, stuck with a boy-man who is incapable of responding to her or shouldering an adult role. His pathetic attempts to pass his GED just illustrates his basic emotional inadequacy. Adams' performance is deeply touching. She is aware of every nuance of her character. Davidtz also gives a fine performance of a woman for whom gesture is all but has lost touch with genuine emotion. Every attempt she makes to get close to the family ends in a cringe-making failure, from her over-familiar kisses to her blatant failure even to remember her mother-in-law's name.I recommend this quiet movie as a funny-sad exploration of the alientation that lurks within family life.",5,Superb drama of quiet desperate lives,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,1563,"['something', 'almost', 'Chekhovian', 'quiet', 'drama', 'trapped', 'people', 'living', 'frustrated', 'lives', 'enlightened', 'sensational', 'performance', 'Amy', 'Adams.It', 'place', 'snall', 'town', 'North', 'Carolina', 'George', 'eldest', 'son', 'family', 'escaped', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Chicago', 'married', 'stylish', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'Madeleine', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'who', 'British', 'accent', 'obnoxious', 'condescending', 'manner', 'Madeleine', 'located', 'primitive', 'folk', 'artist', 'work', 'anxious', 'show', 'who', 'short', 'distance', 'George', 'family', 'so', 'visit', 'place.George', 'family', 'parents', 'jealous', 'bitter', 'unsuccessful', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'turn', 'married', 'heavily-pregnant', 'Ashley', 'played', 'Adams.The', 'arrival', 'outsiders', 'exposes', 'nerves', 'fissures', 'family', 'bringing', 'unhappiness', 'surface', 'Ashley', 'living', 'fantasy', 'marriage', 'stuck', 'boy-man', 'who', 'incapable', 'responding', 'shouldering', 'adult', 'role', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'pass', 'GED', 'just', 'basic', 'emotional', 'inadequacy', 'Adams', 'performance', 'deeply', 'touching', 'aware', 'nuance', 'character', 'Davidtz', 'also', 'fine', 'performance', 'woman', 'whom', 'gesture', 'lost', 'touch', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'attempt', 'get', 'close', 'family', 'cringe-making', 'failure', 'over-familiar', 'kisses', 'blatant', 'failure', 'even', 'remember', 'mother-in-law', 'name.I', 'recommend', 'quiet', 'movie', 'funny-sad', 'exploration', 'alientation', 'family', 'life']",Junebug

It's an efficient movie, in that it goes about its business and achieves its goals in a quiet, no-nonsense manner. Some reviews have characterized this style of the movie as ""boring"" but personally, I think it has a lot of charm, class, and something not a lot of films possess today - restraint.Some people don't like this movie because they feel it ""plays up to stereotypes."" Well, that's a potential problem when doing movies that seek to portray, among other things, ""real life"" in the country and small towns, because stereotypes are often born out of common experiences and observations people have, and have truth to them. The truth may become distorted, but people may also incorrectly assume that just because something is a stereotype, it is inherently negative or inaccurate.In any case, at a glance this movie may seem to be full of stereotypical characters, but I believe it does a fine job of getting past that down to the differences that make everyone unique at some level. I don't see many ""rednecks"" is this movie - David Wark and Johnny could be, everyone else, no.The story has been outlined numerous times on here, so I'll just get to the heart of the review. Many of the people involved with the making of this film were from the area it was filmed and North Carolina, and they do a fine job of rendering it true, despite the claims others have made about ""Hollywood's take."" The acting is as good as advertised. Amy Adams gets due credit for her role as Ashley, but perhaps a hair too much credit - let's face it, it is the showiest role in the movie. Alessandro Nivola, who I've liked in everything I've seen him in (from the delightfully tacky ""Best Laid Plans"" to the rock star in ""Laurel Canyon"") does a great job of bringing more layering to what may seem like a one-dimensional good guy, George. Embeth Davidtz is given fine opportunities to shine as Madeleine, the Chicago gallery owner who is a little quizzical about these new places and people but otherwise exceedingly good natured and game for anything. Celia Weston is underrated as George and Johnny's mother, Peg. Scott Wilson infuses the father Eugene with a fitting taciturn melancholy. Ben McKenzie did a fine job with Johnny as well.The movie lack of didacticism was a refreshing change from other celebrated movies of 2005 (""Crash"") and indeed I was pleased to see it make several critics' Top 10 lists. This movie is not the likeliest to blow people away, though the entire church scene, the farewell scene betwen George and his mother, the Ashley and George bedside scene, and the Johnny-Ashley phone call/Eugene and Peg walk were all very powerful high points of the movie. Instead, as I touched on earlier, the movie prefers to tell its story with a quiet, reserved elegance and quirky charm, not unlike some of the characters it portrays.In conclusion, I recommend this movie for anyone who can enjoy a slower-paced movie. Also, I recommend if you enjoyed the movie, to watch it with commentary. If you don't, you'll never learn interesting morsels of information like the looks in the church scene Embeth Davidtz finds particularly compelling, or what astrological sign Amy Adams suggests Ben McKenzie was born under (hint: she's wrong).

However, even then, if they pooled their resources, they wouldn't be able to produce a movie half as good as Junebug.While the dysfunctional family is familiar ground for audiences, it's never been done more accurately or more lovingly.  This is one of the most disciplined movies you will ever see, every word matters, every nuance.

In a classic set-up of worlds colliding, this film refuses to take sides; it refuses to push an agenda.Junebug is awash in exceptionally good performances; you can tell how good they are because you never notice them.  The splashiest is by Frank Hoyt Taylor as David Wark, the endearingly imbalanced folk artist.

953390,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000BYRCQU,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I wasn't expecting to adore `Junebug' as much as I did, but in all honesty I was, and still am, in love with this film.  It is one of those tender and compassionate films that grow on you the more you embrace it, and I've seen this film a good ten times now and it continues to swell my heart.`Junebug' tells the story of Madeleine and George, a newly married couple who spawn from two different backgrounds that discover themselves while visiting George's family in North Carolina.  Madeleine owns an art gallery in Chicago that specializes in self taught small time artists, and when she gets a whiff of one living near her in-laws she drags her husband along in order to seal the deal, and meet her new family.  It is apparent from the very beginning that George's family is not to enthralled with Madeleine, at least not his mother and younger brother.  His father seems somewhat indifferent, but his very pregnant sister-in-law Ashley is thrilled.  She immediately becomes attached to Madeleine, swapping stories and desiring to know all that there is to know about her new sister.`Junebug' may not on the outset seem like it tells too deep of a story, but beneath the rich character development is a beautiful story of family and the need to feel needed.  In each of the characters there is an innate desire to belong somewhere, to escape their current predicament and find solace in a new place.Madeleine is arguably the star or main character, and her character is truly the one that goes through the most changes.  She is far from a cold of superior type of individual, but she is undoubtedly awkward when face to face with her new in-laws who are far from her social status.  Their less than warm welcome is also a factor in Madeleine's development of character as she struggles to make them pleased with her without losing herself in the process.  George is also met with a catalyst in his relationship with Madeleine as he sees her interact with his family for the first time, seeing just how different she is from her family, and even how much different he's become.And then there is George's family.Peg, his mother, is obviously unsettled about his decision to marry someone like Madeleine, who is too cultured for her.  George's brother Johnny is depressed with his lot in life, always living in the more impressive shadow of his older brother, and thus finds George's visit to be nothing more than a chore.  His wife, the perky Ashley, is also lost within her own existence, but she never allows it to weigh her down.  She longs for something more but is content with living vicariously through her newfound sister than actually to allow her aspirations to depress and restrict her.  She just wants Johnny to love her again like he did in high school, and she hopes that when their child is born (her little Junebug) that her husband will embrace her again.The acting is really what elevates this film though, proving to provide the film with that much needed heart and soul.  Embeth Davidtz is beautifully complete as Madeleine, keeping her character open and exposed to the audience.  Alessandro Nivola in contrast keeps himself guarded, hiding his real feelings as he floats in and out each scene.  Scott Wilson is touching as the quite Eugene and Celia Weston is cold and effectively indifferent as Peg.  The real stars here are Benjamin McKenzie and Amy Adams, both of which develop very strong and very real characters.  McKenzie creates a very secluded and broken young man, tortured by his own inadequacies and his own hatred for his decisions.  He wants something he can never attain, or at least something he won't allow himself to attain.  Adams is a revelation as Ashley, infecting the audience with her natural charm and grace, elevating scenes that could have come across clich&eacute;d or generic into scenes that reach us deeper than any other film could.  Her final scene alone is the most impressive and heart touching scene in any film that given year.Such a powerhouse performance.In the end I must urge you to drop what you are doing and watch this beautiful little film.  `Junebug' is one of the most honest and real films about family and the divisions we build that I have seen in a very long time.  With rich and moving performances, a realistic and touching script and a pace that allows for one to feel invested in the film from start to finish, `Junebug' may very well be one of the best films of 2005.",5,It's rare to find a film this honest...,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,4446,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'adore', 'Junebug', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'honesty', 'was', 'still', 'am', 'love', 'film', 'one', 'tender', 'compassionate', 'films', 'grow', 'more', 'embrace', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'good', 'ten', 'times', 'now', 'swell', 'heart.', 'Junebug', 'story', 'Madeleine', 'George', 'newly', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'spawn', 'two', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'discover', 'visiting', 'George', 'family', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Madeleine', 'art', 'gallery', 'Chicago', 'taught', 'small', 'time', 'artists', 'when', 'whiff', 'one', 'living', 'in-laws', 'husband', 'order', 'seal', 'deal', 'meet', 'new', 'family', 'apparent', 'very', 'beginning', 'George', 'family', 'not', 'enthralled', 'Madeleine', 'least', 'not', 'mother', 'younger', 'brother', 'father', 'somewhat', 'indifferent', 'very', 'pregnant', 'sister-in-law', 'Ashley', 'thrilled', 'immediately', 'attached', 'Madeleine', 'swapping', 'stories', 'desiring', 'know', 'know', 'new', 'sister.', 'Junebug', 'may', 'not', 'outset', 'seem', 'too', 'deep', 'story', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'beautiful', 'story', 'family', 'need', 'feel', 'needed', 'characters', 'innate', 'desire', 'belong', 'somewhere', 'escape', 'current', 'predicament', 'find', 'solace', 'new', 'place.Madeleine', 'arguably', 'star', 'main', 'character', 'character', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'changes', 'far', 'cold', 'superior', 'type', 'individual', 'undoubtedly', 'awkward', 'when', 'face', 'face', 'new', 'in-laws', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'social', 'status', 'less', 'warm', 'welcome', 'also', 'factor', 'Madeleine', 'development', 'character', 'make', 'pleased', 'losing', 'process', 'George', 'also', 'met', 'catalyst', 'relationship', 'Madeleine', 'interact', 'family', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'just', 'how', 'different', 'family', 'even', 'how', 'much', 'different', 'become.And', 'then', 'George', 'family.Peg', 'mother', 'obviously', 'unsettled', 'decision', 'marry', 'someone', 'Madeleine', 'who', 'too', 'cultured', 'George', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'depressed', 'lot', 'life', 'always', 'living', 'more', 'impressive', 'shadow', 'older', 'brother', 'thus', 'George', 'visit', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'chore', 'wife', 'perky', 'Ashley', 'also', 'lost', 'own', 'existence', 'never', 'weigh', 'down', 'something', 'more', 'content', 'living', 'vicariously', 'newfound', 'sister', 'actually', 'allow', 'aspirations', 'depress', 'restrict', 'just', 'Johnny', 'love', 'again', 'did', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'child', 'born', 'little', 'Junebug', 'husband', 'will', 'embrace', 'again.The', 'acting', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'proving', 'provide', 'film', 'much', 'needed', 'heart', 'soul', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'beautifully', 'complete', 'Madeleine', 'keeping', 'character', 'open', 'exposed', 'audience', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'contrast', 'keeps', 'guarded', 'hiding', 'real', 'feelings', 'scene', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'touching', 'quite', 'Eugene', 'Celia', 'Weston', 'cold', 'effectively', 'indifferent', 'Peg', 'real', 'stars', 'here', 'are', 'Benjamin', 'McKenzie', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'develop', 'very', 'strong', 'very', 'real', 'characters', 'McKenzie', 'very', 'secluded', 'broken', 'young', 'man', 'tortured', 'own', 'inadequacies', 'own', 'hatred', 'decisions', 'something', 'can', 'never', 'attain', 'least', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'attain', 'Adams', 'revelation', 'Ashley', 'infecting', 'audience', 'natural', 'charm', 'grace', 'elevating', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'clich', 'eacute', 'generic', 'scenes', 'reach', 'deeper', 'other', 'film', 'could', 'final', 'scene', 'alone', 'most', 'impressive', 'heart', 'touching', 'scene', 'film', 'given', 'powerhouse', 'end', 'must', 'urge', 'drop', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'little', 'film', 'Junebug', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'real', 'films', 'family', 'divisions', 'build', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'rich', 'moving', 'performances', 'realistic', 'touching', 'script', 'pace', 'one', 'feel', 'invested', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'Junebug', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2005']",Junebug

Madeleine and George are big city Chicago yuppies, and they decide to take a trip to small town North Carolina to visit George's family.  Mom is almost immediately hostile, but you are never quite sure if it's because she's bitter about her own unfulfilled dreams or if because Madeleine has stolen her boy.  Johnny is the sullen and less successful sibling that resents his older brothers success.  The one bright spot in the family is Ashley, Johnny's sweet and very pregnant wife, played by Amy Adams.  Ashley is seemingly naive and thrilled about becoming a mother, and it becomes clear pretty early on that it is her inner strength that keeps the family from self-destructing.  Johnny seems like a lunkhead at first, but he shows unexpected depth and affection for his wife when he scurries around for a tape to record a program about butterflies for Ashley.  With his undeveloped emotional maturity, however, he lashes out at her when she walks in the room because he was unable to find a tape.  She then utters the most poignant line of the movie, ""God loves you too much to let you stay this way.""This is not a movie you will want to watch over and over again.  I think we will all be able to see some of our own families in this.  It is definitely worth a look, however.

Her husband George's family lives nearby and they go to stay with them while she attempts to cajole the artist to let her represent him at her gallery.The sophisticated Madeleine uses all her charm and grace to endear herself to the husband's family with mixed results.  The mother isn't buying any of it, thinking she is older and not right for her son.  The father likes her, but it is despite her charming veneer.  The younger brother resents his brother and is anxious with his responsibilities, especially the advent of fatherhood. But her biggest fan is the younger brother's pregnant wife, played by the justly honored Amy Adams as the sweetly eager and hopeful Ashley.There is fine work here by all.  Embeth has the right note of bewilderment that all her natural charisma is lost on these folks.  Every move she makes, which no doubt had always worked for her in England and Chicago, fails her here.  The mother makes no effort to conceal her displeasure with her older son's choice.  Eugene, the patriarch, is a taciturn and quietly kind man and is another wonderful portrayal by the superb Scott Wilson. Eugene is the epitome of decency, and it's all in the face and the eyes as he looks on without judgement or comment.  Scott Wilson (who I first appreciated in In Cold Blood decades ago) brings a lifetime of acting experience to bear on the quiet stoicism of Eugene.These are unashamedly ""God-fearing folk"" who wear their religion out there for anyone to see.  It is to the film's credit that they do not mock this, but explore its value to the lives of these people.  Likewise, their faith is presented as joyful and forgiving and not harsh and judgmental.  The scene where George sings a hymn, to the undisguised amazement of his wife who realizes she knows him only a little, is a gem.Toward the end of the film I began to see Madeleine's inappropriatness in this arena was just as profound as if one of these rurals wore bib overalls to one of her gallery showings.  She does no better navigating these waters than they would trying to fit in her world.  And when she makes a decision not to join the family at a crucial moment, but rather to go make a full-court press to sign the crackpot artist instead, the emptiness of her priorities is apparent, as she is made aware of by the simple sincerity of the condolences offered by the artist's sister.The mother's comment after Madeleine's expressed concern ""don't worry about Ashley, she's a firecracker"" speaks volumes about what holds these people together.  You see in their neat and orderly house, you see in their neighbors, in their friends and their pastor, the great strength and bedrock of decency. Decency.  No small thing.Driving back, George expresses how glad he is to leave.  We have seen him reimersed in his roots and the tensions and dynamics of small town family life.  He is touched again by their faith but Wolfe's ""you can't go home again"" applies. It is back to the big city, but Madeleine has had a glimpse of something deeply ingrained she doesn't recognize in her husband, and George has glimpsed something of the superficiality of his wife's values and the life they have embraced.  Perhaps for the better, or not.Oh, and again, if I didn't express strongly what has been so ardently mentioned by so many reviewers, Amy Adam's Ashley absolutely elevates the entire enterprise.

The movie's like life in that way, alternating between being funny and sad while always feeling authentic.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[7, 15]","When Madeleine (Emily Davidtz), a bohemian art dealer from Chicago, married George (Alessandro Nivola), a true southern beau, life started getting interesting. Their whirlwind marriage occurred only a few weeks after they met (love at first sight) and when they decided to head to North Carolina on business, and meet up with George's eccentric and challenging family, short circuits were bound to happen.Madeleine is deposited into this family's home, meeting such interesting members as the quiet father Eugene (Scott Wilson), the domineering matriarchal family leader Peg (Celia Weston), the angry and loathsome brother Johnny (Benjamin McKenzie), and the lonely but ever upbeat - and pregnant - sister-in-law Ashley (Amy Adams).Battles between small town American values and big city life clash (albeit very quietly) as Madeleine, George and George's family have to deal with old wounds left by George's leaving the town three years ago, old wounds that are opened anew within confused brother Johnny, the sexual appetite Madeleine and George have for one another in a household (and community) that has long since lost these passions, and a family that continues to hide its dysfunctions._____________________________________________________________________________________________I love indie films. Love everything they stand for - little nothing company breaks into film on a shoestring budget, possibly gaining a larger audience thanks to such festivals as Sundance and Cannes. But sometimes these independents miss the mark.I'll probably bring the wrath of reviewers down upon me for saying this, but I didn't care for JUNEBUG at all. Once again I was fooled into believing what the critics (Ebert and Roeper, etc.) said about a film and decided to rent it.I guess most of my disappointment comes from the pacing. Although southern life tends to be slow, and this is an interesting fact of life for those that live in the Carolinas and surrounding area, it doesn't necessarily translate well to film. I found myself yawning far too often.The other big disappointment is that the movie's labeled as a ""comedy/drama."" The fact that I didn't crack a smile once during the entire flick tells me that either I missed the parts that were supposed to make me laugh (I'm usually a pretty astute viewer, though), or they (the laughs) missed their mark. Looking over the special features on the DVD, I found it puzzling when many of the actors and actresses kept referring to ""the comedic portions of the film."" Again, I didn't see it.And my final complaint is that the characters - with the exception of Amy Adams - were all one dimensional.I will give some praise to the filming and cinematography. The director caught the unique qualities of the South quite well, so visually I thought the film was well put together.

Some lambast the work because it doesn't seem to have much of a plot; others didn't like any of the characters; and still others feel, or even state, that the function of movie or book is to ""entertain."" Of course we can bicker over the definition of ""entertain"", but be aware that this movie doesn't really have a plot, it doesn't have many likable characters, and it is not entertaining in the sense of providing amusement.A married couple drive down south so that the wife can hopefully sign a contract with an artist, and also so they can visit with hubby's parents. The reason for the trip south is mostly a MacGuffin to get us to our destination (a MacGuffin being a Hitchcock term meaning a story gimmick that gets us somewhere, but is not really important to the story).This movie is all about the characters, and in my view the casting director should get an Academy Award. It was a brilliant idea to cast with little known or unknown actors. These people are set solid in a rut, and being in that rut results in a lot of stifled anger, especially in the case of the husband's brother who totally hates his life and is probably clinically depressed. At best these folks have learned to accommodate to their situation, and are more or less waiting for life to run its course...and end. The accent point in this dull piece of scenery is the  brother's sister in law who goes through life in a happy, manically sort of way. That her mania is covering her own possible depression is shown in a solo bedroom scene.We enter these peoples lives, and an hour and a half later we leave their lives. The plot ""resolution"" is that there isn't any. Thank goodness no miracle working do gooder enters the picture and changes everybody for the better. Some moviegoers like it when this happens, but it doesn't happen here, and such an event would ruin it.So folks, there is only a thread of a plot. Chances are you won't recognize most of the actors, and you won't finish it and leap up and say ""by George that was an entertaining movie"". I find that I never leap up and say that when I watch a Shakespearean tragedy either.

Early on, Madeleine is dispatched to a small North Carolina town to meet a reclusive artist who's paintings her gallery would like to secure.  Said town happens to be in the vicinity of George's hometown, so a sidetrip to meet the folks is only logical.  Having never met George's new wife, the family is slightly hesitant and somewhat leary as to what to expect upon first encounter.  Particularly piqued in interest is sister-in-law Ashley, who gazes upon all things with wide-eyed wonder and is beyond anxious to meet this stranger.  The film provides a nice, realistic portrait of the awkwardness of meeting a spouse's family as well as the awkwardness of a foreigner invading the everyday life of a small-town family.

953404,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BYRCQU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[23, 26]","I was a little wary of this film going in.  Any film that basically sends a Yankee woman down South can easily turn in to something that ridicules Southerners - and not only did this film take place in the South, it came right here to my own Tar Heel backyard.  Starting things off with some footage of the state's annual hollerin' contest seemed a bad omen, but - much to my delight (and relief) - I found nothing to really complain about here.  Sure, there are some stereotypes in the mix - but these are only on the surface (with the exception of the painter character) and Junebug goes far beyond skin deep.  It's an unusual film, to say the least.  Refreshingly different, this film brings together a wonderful myriad of public and private, deeply personal moments, allowing the actors to truly become their characters rather than having their characters imposed upon them.  Some folks won't enjoy this film at all, I'm sure, finding the silent moments others of us find uncommonly compelling to be - well - boring.  This isn't an action film or a comedy or even a drama in the common sense - although there are certainly a number of funny and dramatic moments encompassed in the story.  Those who truly appreciate the art of moviemaking, I believe, will find Junebug an uplifting experience.  It's worth seeing just for Amy Adams' performance alone - she's utterly fantastic.Newlyweds George (Alessandro Nivola) and Madeleine (Embeth Davidtz) apparently had a small, private wedding because she has never met his family.  When they find themselves traveling to North Carolina in order for Madeleine, an art gallery owner in Chicago, to court a promising folk artist, they naturally swing by to meet the folks.  It's quite a family.  There's Dad (Scott Wilson), the strong, silent type who spends most of his time in the basement, woodworking and looking for his screwdriver; Mom (Celia Weston), the enigmatic, direct, suspicious mother; Johnny (Benjamin McKenzie), George's moody, taciturn, stand-offish brother; and Johnny's wife Ashley (Amy Adams), who literally lights up the screen with her over-excitable, spontaneous personality (she's also the only major actor in the film to speak anything like a native North Carolinian).  Ashley's the type who would drive many a person completely up the wall with her inability to ever stop talking and her immense wonder at everything in the world, but I quite fell in love with her from the very start.  It's pretty obvious that part of her behavior is a front for some sadness, even desperation, in her life, and it's not hard to find the source - the uncommunicative Johnny, who seems to want nothing to do with anybody - especially George.  Speaking of George, he sort of just disappears early on, leaving his fish-out-of-water wife to tackle all of his relatives on her own.With no major happenings other than the impending arrival of Ashley's baby and Madeleine's frantic efforts to land the soon-to-be famous folk artist David Wark (Frank Hoyt Taylor), much of the focus is on the interrelationships of the family members, the issues and common bonds that make them a family.  Some of the issues boil up to the surface largely because of Madeleine's presence.  A look oftentimes says more than an extended scene of dialogue, and we do see some way into the souls of most of these individuals.  There's no real sense of cloture at the end, but I suppose that is only natural since there is no real ending to family life itself.  Things are always changing, for better or for worst.  I certainly wonder what the future holds for these people - those I liked, anyway.I have not seen The Constant Gardener, but that isn't going to stop me from saying that Amy Adams deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress over Rachel Weisz (and, seemingly, every film body other than the Academy agreed with me).  Ashley is as captivating a character as I've come across in a long time, and Adams' performance runs the whole gamut from childlike glee to heart-breaking tragedy.I would note that Junebug does not really capture the Tar Heel or Southern spirit - although pieces of it are there.  I also can't imagine that David Wark's artwork would go over big in the South at all - anyone who draws the thing he draws on Robert E. Lee (and every other character in his War Between the States-themed work) won't be met by many open arms down here.I only have one minor complaint about this film, and it concerns the director's sense of direction.  It was interesting when he sidestepped away from a conversation to show us empty rooms with the muffled conversation continuing in the background, and some of his isolated shots of different little scenes were all well and good, but I think he just took it a bit too far at one point, making it look a little too much like he was just trying to be artsy-fartsy about the whole thing.  That's truly a miniscule issue, however - certainly not enough to keep me from giving this refreshingly real film five stars.",5,"Refreshingly unadorned, honest filmmaking",1146268800,"04 29,

953407,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BYRCQU,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 7]","This low-budget indie sneaks up on you after a relatively unpromising start that reminds me a bit of Miranda July's casual randomness in her meandering ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"". However, once the pacing gains momentum after the first half-hour or so, it starts to build a cautious emotional resonance befitting the story of an outsider to a group of people not ready to accept her as one of their own. The outsider is a worldly Chicago art gallery owner named Madeleine. The group is her husband George's small town North Carolina family, whom she meets for the first time six months after their wedding. Madeleine is really in the area to try to sign up an eccentric and profane folk artist to her gallery, one of many points of contention between her and George's family. With a script by Angus MacLachlan, the thrust of the plot focuses on her rather unctuous attempts to ingratiate herself with George's family, full of painfully good intentions but also an unwelcome source of revelation for what she learns about George and ultimately herself.Director Phil Morrison is an observant filmmaker, and much of the friction is expressed through glances and passing remarks the way it would transpire in real life. There are certainly arid patches during the running time, but I genuinely started caring about the characters despite my own predisposition toward them at the beginning. Much of the acting helps considerably. As Madeleine, Embeth Davidtz has the most difficult role as she provides the viewer perspective but also goes through her own catharsis in recognizing George's intractable bond with a family she initially doesn't admire but eventually comes to like and respect. Celia Weston and Scott Wilson play George's parents Peg and Eugene with controlled emotional accuracy. Movie trivialists may remember Wilson as killer Richard Hickock in 1967's ""In Cold Blood"", the film version of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel.Although there are hints that George is more religiously zealous than Madeleine knows, Alessandro Nivola hardly makes an impression as George since the script doesn't really develop the character beyond being the fulcrum for the plot machinations. Benjamin McKenzie is the one misfire of the cast as he seems ill-equipped to play George's emotionally stunted little brother Johnny. On the other hand,  Amy Adams is superb as his effusive wife Ashley, and she deserves the accolades she has been receiving this award season. Even though I assumed from her first line that she would be a caricature, she nails the part of an almost painfully buoyant spirit whose hopes for future happiness seem to rest solely on her pregnancy. Adams makes every glimmer of optimism poignant and her disappointments devastating. By the time the film ends, I unexpectedly got wrapped up in these characters' lives.The DVD has ten deleted scenes that I agree would have merely compounded the already leisurely pacing, but there is one extended scene - where George's parents express their affection and Madeleine and Johnny clarify their misunderstanding - that could have helped tie up some of the plot's loose ends.  There is an audio commentary track by Davidtz and Adams but surprisingly not Morrison or MacLachlan, and consequently we are not provided much insight into the filmmaking process itself. It's the same problem I had with Debra Messing's solitary commentary on ""The Wedding Date"", a film which coincidentally featured Adams playing the betrothed sister. There are five shorts where the actors provide more of a backstory to the characters. All in all, it's a solid set of extras if you like the film.",4,An Outsider's Tale Brought to Gradual Life with Some Stellar Acting,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,3638,"['low-budget', 'indie', 'up', 'relatively', 'unpromising', 'start', 'bit', 'Miranda', 'July', 'casual', 'randomness', 'meandering', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'However', 'once', 'pacing', 'gains', 'momentum', 'first', 'half-hour', 'so', 'build', 'cautious', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'befitting', 'story', 'outsider', 'group', 'people', 'not', 'ready', 'accept', 'one', 'own', 'outsider', 'worldly', 'Chicago', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'named', 'Madeleine', 'group', 'husband', 'George', 'small', 'town', 'North', 'Carolina', 'family', 'whom', 'first', 'time', 'six', 'months', 'wedding', 'Madeleine', 'really', 'area', 'try', 'sign', 'up', 'eccentric', 'profane', 'folk', 'artist', 'gallery', 'one', 'many', 'points', 'contention', 'George', 'family', 'script', 'Angus', 'MacLachlan', 'thrust', 'plot', 'rather', 'unctuous', 'attempts', 'ingratiate', 'George', 'family', 'full', 'painfully', 'good', 'intentions', 'also', 'unwelcome', 'source', 'revelation', 'what', 'George', 'ultimately', 'herself.Director', 'Phil', 'Morrison', 'observant', 'filmmaker', 'much', 'friction', 'expressed', 'glances', 'passing', 'remarks', 'way', 'would', 'transpire', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'certainly', 'arid', 'patches', 'running', 'time', 'genuinely', 'started', 'caring', 'characters', 'own', 'predisposition', 'beginning', 'Much', 'acting', 'considerably', 'Madeleine', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'most', 'difficult', 'role', 'viewer', 'perspective', 'also', 'own', 'catharsis', 'recognizing', 'George', 'intractable', 'bond', 'family', 'initially', ""n't"", 'admire', 'eventually', 'like', 'respect', 'Celia', 'Weston', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'play', 'George', 'parents', 'Peg', 'Eugene', 'controlled', 'emotional', 'accuracy', 'Movie', 'trivialists', 'may', 'remember', 'Wilson', 'killer', 'Richard', 'Hickock', '1967', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'film', 'version', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'non-fiction', 'are', 'hints', 'George', 'more', 'religiously', 'zealous', 'Madeleine', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'hardly', 'impression', 'George', 'script', ""n't"", 'really', 'develop', 'character', 'being', 'fulcrum', 'plot', 'machinations', 'Benjamin', 'McKenzie', 'one', 'misfire', 'cast', 'ill-equipped', 'play', 'George', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'little', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'other', 'hand', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'superb', 'effusive', 'wife', 'Ashley', 'accolades', 'been', 'receiving', 'award', 'season', 'Even', 'assumed', 'first', 'line', 'would', 'be', 'caricature', 'part', 'almost', 'painfully', 'buoyant', 'spirit', 'hopes', 'future', 'happiness', 'seem', 'rest', 'solely', 'pregnancy', 'Adams', 'glimmer', 'optimism', 'poignant', 'disappointments', 'devastating', 'time', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'got', 'wrapped', 'up', 'characters', 'lives.The', 'DVD', 'ten', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'agree', 'would', 'have', 'merely', 'compounded', 'already', 'leisurely', 'pacing', 'one', 'extended', 'scene', 'where', 'George', 'parents', 'express', 'affection', 'Madeleine', 'Johnny', 'clarify', 'misunderstanding', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'tie', 'up', 'plot', 'loose', 'ends', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'Davidtz', 'Adams', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'Morrison', 'MacLachlan', 'consequently', 'are', 'not', 'provided', 'much', 'insight', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'same', 'problem', 'had', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'solitary', 'commentary', 'Wedding', 'Date', 'film', 'coincidentally', 'featured', 'Adams', 'playing', 'betrothed', 'sister', 'are', 'five', 'shorts', 'where', 'actors', 'provide', 'more', 'backstory', 'characters', 'solid', 'set', 'extras', 'like', 'film']",Junebug

What I did realize however was that I was a bit perplexed while viewing it and this was due to the fact that it didn't read like most films I've seen. I needed to adjust my perspective. As a matter of fact I'll need to re-visit this to see how it changes second time around.George is from South Carolina and is now in Chicago married to Madeline who is an art dealer and needs to travel to a place that is very near George's home to sign an ""outside"" artist. They make the trip and stay at George's family's home just days before his sister in law is about to have her first child.This is a ""slice o' life"" type of flick but there are a few plot driven elements present. What was most surprising to me was the interaction between the characters. As others have pointed out there is no finger pointing here. These people are treated with respect. Even the artist, who is openly racist and an anti-semite, is not shown as being bad. I got more the impression that, like his art, he has strong convictions but with no connection to the real world. And George himself: In one scene, when he is asked by the reverend of his church to sing a particular hymn, he does so with great beauty and sincerity. You come to realize that he may live in Chicago now, but he came from, and is part of, this place down to his bones.All the performances here are top shelf, (Amy Adams' character is a real hoot), and they go a long way in helping form the complex relationships these people have with one another. The directing, editing, sound work and music are good as well. But what is really happening here is the script. It never seemed to go in the direction I thought it might. Everything here was unexpected and that is the beauty of it all. Watching each character's relationship with cigarettes or watching as each retires to bed for the night are all important.

953412,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BYRCQU,Grady Harp,"[3, 6]","With astonishing grace and insight first time director Phil Morrison brings newcomer writer Angus MacLachlan's script JUNEBUG to quiet realization and the result is one of the more subtle and fine cinematic accomplishments of the past year.  The study of a fractured family unit and the manner in which each disparate member functions may have been told before ('In the Bedroom' comes first to mind), but rarely has the polarity of atmospheres between the family of origin and the prodigal son been so sensitively scrutinized.The successful Chicago art dealer Madeleine (Embeth Davidtz) works in a gallery featuring Outsider Artists (artists without formal training who make art from the heart sans history) and discovers the fascinating racist/sexually informed/visionary art by one David Wark (Frank Hoyt Taylor) who happens to live in North Carolina near her new husband George's (Alessandro Nivola) home town. George left his little hick town to find success in the big world of Chicago, married the elegant Madeleine without inviting his family (as they might embarrass him in their crude state), and continues to distance himself from them.  But Madeleine coaxes George into driving to North Carolina  to seal the deal of adding Wark to her stable of artists.Once in North Carolina Madelene pursues Wark, meets George's family whom she finds warm and loving, leaving George to address his reasons for distance.  George's mother Peg (Celia Weston) is simple but loving; his father Eugene (Scott Wilson) is rather useless except that he like to wood carve; his brother Johnny (Benjamin McKenzie) is a disturbed angry high school dropout who resents George's upward mobility and all that it represents; and his very pregnant sister-in-law Ashley (Amy Adams), who though unsophisticated, having dropped out of high school because of her pregnancy, contains more joie de vivre than any character ever encountered in film.  Ashley emulates Madeleine, finding in her all of the dreams of life - beauty, wealth, success, personality.  Each of the family members have moments with George and Madeleine that gel the differences and the common threads in a family where often little is said but much is felt.  The story climaxes with Ashley's delivery and the effect that incident has on the entire group.The cast is exceptional with Amy Smart delivering one of those poignant perfect performances that covers the entire gamut of emotion: she certainly should be nominated for Best Supporting Actress if not Best Actress for this outstanding role.  Embeth Davidtz is superb as the elegant but vulnerable Madeleine, Alessandro Nivola may not have many lines but says so much with his facial and body language that he is the pinnacle of understatement.  Likewise Celia Weston, Scott Wilson, and Frank Hoyt Taylor offer pitch perfect performances. This is definitely an ensemble movie.  Director Morrison allows the camera (cinematographer Peter Donahue) to linger listlessly on the countryside of the South in a manner that speaks volumes about the pace of life in the little towns away from the big city and adds to the development of George's change of heart after his experience at home.  The musical score by Yo La Tengo sets just the right mood.This is an extraordinary film that despite its small flaws of a first film outing deserves wide attention and promises us that there is an important new talent on the rise in Phil Morrison.

It is uneven (the schizo artist guy was a bad touch) but it also soars at times. The physical passion between Madeline and George was one of the finest protrayals of real sexuality I have ever seen in an American film. The mainstream studios could learn from this film. But Embeth Davidtz's finest scene may be her reaction to George as he sings a solo hymn (at the pastor's insistence) at the church social- you can just see her sense of wonder as she discovers that there is a spiritual and artistic side to her husband that she had no idea existed- and you can see her falling in love all over again without her having to saying a word.

About all that was missing was the gun rack.Goodness, I think I've just reviewed the whole movie in my opening paragraph.No, wait . . . I forgot about Ashley.  Played to the hilt by Amy Adams, she's sort of a Southern Baptist Agnes of God who, in her sweet simple-mindedness, may be the only one on this side of the holler who has the remotest chance of understanding goodness and of catching a glimpse of God's shadow lurking behind all the church-going.As was Agnes herself, Ashley is apparently pregnant by the hand of God, because it's hard to imagine her husband having had much to do with it.  Throughout the movie, he evinces only two brief flashes of awareness of her existence -- one when he desperately tries to record a TV clip of her favorite animal, and one when he dashes about to get her to the hospital to give birth.  But both are fleeting moments that, by their brevity, reveal his utter lack of ability to articulate love or even to suspect that it might exist.  His life basically hovers on the event horizon of a black hole of lethargy, resentment, and despair, sending out only those two gamma ray bursts before he is finally sucked in to emotional oblivion.And poor Ashley plays it in reverse.  An ever-ebullient and guileless soul, she has but a brief moment of insight into the depths in which she is mired as she lies abed after her miscarriage, opening her soul to a brother-in-law she barely knows and who is trying to throw a cloak of decency over her husband's absence.The movie ends as these kinds of lives end -- just slowly spiralling downward into an ever-deepening gloom of pointless repetition.  It seems Ashley and her husband will attempt another child, with nary a pause taken to ponder that pitiful thing they pretend to be a marriage.And her brother-in-law and his wife head back up north, with his ambivalence about his background unresolved, with her new understanding that the southern concept of familial duty will remain perpetually beyond her grasp . . . and with both unable to come to terms or even to conversation with what just happened on one sunny visit to North Carolina.If Faulkner had written movie scripts, this one would have his name all over it.",4,"Oh, Lordy . . .",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,3235,"['Now', 'just', ""n't"", 'South', 'remember', 'childhood', 'mother', 'highly', 'suspicious', 'thin', 'women', 'who', 'read', 'too', 'many', 'books', 'neighbor', 'maintaining', 'watch', 'comings', 'goings', 'other', 'residents', 'father', 'hiding', 'basement', 'workshop', 'had', 'can', 'stand', 'Ma', 'Snopes', 'upstairs', 'whom', 'inexplicably', 'courted', 'married', 'bred', 'clue', 'would', 'eventually', 'look', 'sound', 'own', 'mother', 'brothers', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drink', 'work', 'cars', 'together', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead', 'water', 'tobacco', 'pretty', 'much', 'form', 'social', 'bonding', 'agent', 'church', 'going', 'social', 'hall', 'eating', 'ineffably', 'moving', 'sonorous', 'hymns', 'pouring', 'mouths', 'otherwise', 'have', 'difficulty', 'ordering', 'grits', 'aversion', 'Jews', 'city', 'folk', 'little', 'distinction', 'two', 'village', 'idiot', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'savant', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'set', 'relatives', 'who', 'can', 'abuse', 'hell', 'absolutely', 'compunction', 'play', 'family-', 'got', 'ta', '-stick-together', 'card', 'time', 'get', 'pinch', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'gun', 'rack.Goodness', 'think', ""'ve"", 'just', 'reviewed', 'whole', 'movie', 'opening', 'paragraph.No', 'wait', 'forgot', 'Ashley', 'Played', 'hilt', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'sort', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'Agnes', 'God', 'who', 'sweet', 'simple-mindedness', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'holler', 'who', 'remotest', 'chance', 'understanding', 'goodness', 'catching', 'glimpse', 'God', 'shadow', 'lurking', 'church-going.As', 'was', 'Agnes', 'Ashley', 'apparently', 'pregnant', 'hand', 'God', 'hard', 'imagine', 'husband', 'having', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'brief', 'flashes', 'awareness', 'existence', 'one', 'when', 'desperately', 'record', 'TV', 'clip', 'favorite', 'animal', 'one', 'when', 'get', 'hospital', 'give', 'birth', 'are', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'brevity', 'reveal', 'utter', 'lack', 'ability', 'articulate', 'love', 'even', 'suspect', 'might', 'exist', 'life', 'basically', 'hovers', 'event', 'horizon', 'black', 'hole', 'lethargy', 'resentment', 'despair', 'sending', 'out', 'only', 'two', 'gamma', 'ray', 'bursts', 'finally', 'sucked', 'emotional', 'oblivion.And', 'poor', 'Ashley', 'reverse', 'ever-ebullient', 'guileless', 'soul', 'brief', 'moment', 'insight', 'depths', 'mired', 'abed', 'miscarriage', 'opening', 'soul', 'brother-in-law', 'barely', 'who', 'trying', 'throw', 'cloak', 'decency', 'husband', 'absence.The', 'movie', 'kinds', 'lives', 'end', 'just', 'slowly', 'spiralling', 'downward', 'ever-deepening', 'gloom', 'pointless', 'repetition', 'Ashley', 'husband', 'will', 'attempt', 'child', 'pause', 'taken', 'ponder', 'pitiful', 'thing', 'pretend', 'be', 'marriage.And', 'brother-in-law', 'wife', 'head', 'back', 'north', 'ambivalence', 'background', 'unresolved', 'new', 'understanding', 'southern', 'concept', 'familial', 'duty', 'will', 'remain', 'perpetually', 'grasp', 'unable', 'come', 'terms', 'even', 'conversation', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'one', 'sunny', 'visit', 'North', 'Carolina.If', 'Faulkner', 'had', 'written', 'movie', 'scripts', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'name']",Junebug

953417,A106016KSI0YQ,B000BYRCQU,Jay Dickson,"[5, 10]","Phil Morrison's JUNEBUG is a quiet indie film largely about a culture clash when a handsome Chicago man (Alessandro Nivola) brings his beautiful, intelligent art dealer wife (Embeth Davidtz) home to his North Carolina smalltown. Although the good and empathetic Madeline wishes to be kind and respectful to her new in-laws, she cannot help but upset them by her mere presence: to George's sullen brother-in-law Johnnie's (Ben McKenzie), her intelligence and beauty are intimidating in a way that causes him to lash out at her, and which cause his father Eugene to hide in seclusion in his woodshop, frightened by her attractions; to her tight-lipped mother-in-law Peg (Celia Weston), Madeline represents the new ways which she thinks have lured her favorite son away from his home and its values. Only Johnnie's talkative lonely pregnant wife Ashley (Amy Adams) responds openly and lovingly to Madeline, who represents almost a state of grace to Ashley in terms of her beauty and privileged cosmopolitan lifestyle.The film's performances are terrific, and while Adams's work has been justly praised and awarded (she seems to have almost no outer hide as Ashley, and wears her enthusiasms and loves so openly she carries all before her). Davidtz is also superb as a basically good and kind woman who has become a kind of serpent in Eden despite herself, simply because of what she represents. But Morrison and the screenwriter, Angus Maclachlan, are so careful not to overshape the material that they leave it a bit amorphous, and the roots of some of the problems of the characters are never fleshed out. The most crucial problem is that the key role of Madline's husband, the adored George (Nivola), is left grossly underwritten: it's never clear why he has not returned to North Carolina for three years when he clearly respects his family and his roots so much, or why he leaves his wife almost entirely to her own devices during their stay when his family is so openly hostile to her. You also wonder why this extremely articulate woman never bothers to ask her husband for any help or advice during their stay, other than the fact that the film seems (both formally and thematically) to be a kind of glorification of inarticulacy, represented by the handsome George who snoozes all day on the sofa and then happily makes silent love to his wife at night on the inflatable guest mattress. Indeed, George seems at some level to want Madeline to avoid her career and show her respects to the family, which are somehow connected in this film to female fertility. When Madeline does not attend a family member's visit to the hospital (as George wishes she would) so she can pursue her career for a crucial encounter with an artist she is courting for her gallery, the results are disastrous, almost as if to suggest that Madeline's desires for a career are ultimately deadly to family life.

This movie seems to attempt to capture that strange realm when you're at the mercy of the people and lives around you. It does this primarily through the eye's of a newly married, well traveled, socially confident and successful woman traveling 1000 miles south for work and also to meet her new husbands Methodist family.The film is sometimes quirky, sometimes stark, and very naked in painting and seemingly portraying uneven and unfamiliar worlds. The scenes often have a very bare and vulnerable feel to them. The acting is great and the filmmaker involves the viewer intimately in every shot. This is a ""day in the life of"" kind of film which I am usually a sucker for so I found it engaging. Each person you meet is different and interesting. You don't really know where the story is going but you don't care because each scene commands your attention. Many scenes seem explicit in their nature with the indiscriminate snippets of the characters presented to us sitting alone, having sex, going to church, or buttering toast.One person reviewing this film said this film could be summed up best using a couple lines from it's script in which the new couple meet for the first time in an art gallery. female lead: ""So, you like this one?""... Male: ""Yeah, it makes me happy... but I'm going to buy the UFO.""Whether or not you like the film will depend on your own interpretation and the overall theme or category this film should be in is unidentifiable.

That's because this tale of fast-living urbanites visiting a slow-paced southern town doesn't feature obvious gags involving ""country bumpkins"" clashing with ""polished urban sophisticates"".  It also doesn't push obvious lessons like the city folk learning that, despite their apparent lack of worldliness, the country folk really have a lot of wisdom to impart to the city slickers.  No, in ""Junebug"" all of the characters are basically decent but imperfect; there are good and less than good qualities about the city folk and good and less than good qualities about the country folk.  And the lessons learned, if any, are subtle ones.  Actually it's not so much lessons that are learned here, but a deeper appreciation for one's spouse, as several of the couples in the film undergo relationship shifts to some degree due to events in the movie.  I'm especially thinking of the city couple, George and Madeleine, who have a playful, sensual, but maybe still a little superficial relationship at the beginning of the film (nicely summed up during their car ride together at the outset), but a deeper, more serious appreciation of one another at film's end, after they've spent a week or so with George's family and their many issues (compare their car ride at the end of the film with the one in the beginning).The DVD features a nice selection of interesting extras.  Especially good is the commentary track, where two of the film's actresses- Amy Adams who plays Ashley and Embath Davidtz who plays Madeleine- share a wonderful discussion that further illuminates many of the film's issues and themes, though it's kind of nice that even the actresses in the movie often speculate about what the film is trying to say about certain things.  I agree with Ms. Adams and Ms. Davidtz in that the film stays a little mysterious about its intentions in a lot of ways, but not so much that it ever crosses over into being unsatisfying.  Several short behind-the-scenes pieces are worth checking out, too.  They're in turn thoughtful and playful, and also provide an interesting look at how lower-budget films get the most bang from their buck, production-wise.To close with another comment or two about the movie itself, I also love the absolutely adorable, catchy main theme song that opens and closes the film.  You'll be humming it for days.  You'll also be thinking of Amy Adams' wonderful performance as the wide-eyed but knowing Ashley, one of the best supporting characters of the year.

Too bad really because this movie is one of the best movies of 2005. Embeth Davidtz plays Madeleine, an art gallery owner who travels to North Carolina with her new husband George (Alessandro Nivola) to convince an artist to add some of his painting to her gallery. As it turns out though, George's family lives in North Carolina, so they kill two birds with one stone and Madeleine meets her new in-laws. They consist of Peg (Celia Weston), George's moody mother. Eugene (Scott Wilson), George's mostly silent father. Johnny (Ben McKenzie), George's annoyed brother. And Ashley (Amy Adams), Johnny's very pregnant wife. When they arrive, no one takes much of an interest in either one of them, except Ashley who wants to know everything about Madeleine. Anyway, that's really a basic synopsis...Nothing you won't find on the back of the DVD. But, I kid you not this is an amazing, heartwarming and at times sad movie. Amy Adams is so charming, cute, and delightful to watch it's unreal. I was skeptical of how McKenzie would be in this movie (this is the dude from the show The OC) and he was pretty good.

953421,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B000BYRCQU,J. SHARP,"[5, 7]","While this film is sometimes uneven in its pacing and priorities and often quirky simply for its own sake, on the whole it was well worth the investment of time and effort to watch it. It was certainly one of the better films of 2005 and, as has been stated many times here, Amy Adams' Supporting Actress nomination was richly deserved. In fact, she was flat-out robbed in not winning.If you've ever spent an unexpectedly protracted time in a family member's home (where every routine is backward to yours, personal tensions are kept just out of your sight with varying degrees of success, politeness has different definitions and contexts, and even the sounds and smells are foreign) the stylistic approach of 'Junebug' will give you a nearly claustrophobic sense of deja vu.Some of the themes presented here are well-worn: ""All regional cultures have good and bad in them,"" ""Do you really know the people closest to you?"" ""Dysfunction is a distorted mask worn by thwarted attempts at showing love,"" and ""Why doesn't anyone say what they're really feeling?"" But the realism with which it is occasionally portrayed in 'Junebug' hits awfully close to home.Amy Adams walked an extremely fine line with amazing ability here. The relentlessly dogged positivity and adorability of her character was designed to be comic, admirable, tragic, and unwittingly profound but could easily have veered into an unbelievably cartoony pathos. Judging from the clips of Adams' audition, she had just the right touch mapped out from day one. I can't imagine anyone else playing her this perfectly. My test for her performance was, ""Is this realistic? Have I actually met people like her?"" I have.I am an 8th generation Southerner. Some Southerners see Adams' character as a stereotype. Is she? She could be interpreted as one. If you see her as just a dumb, sweet hick, then she is a stereotype to you. But I saw a voraciously curious, idealistic, restless, compassionate young woman who felt absolutely trapped in a home that didn't reward such things and who adapted the only way she knew how - gathering obscure knowledge like manna and always holding out hope, no matter the evidence to the contrary. She was inundated with negativity from every angle, every day and you could see her mentally trying to ignore the gunk thrown on her rose-colored glasses at the beginning of each sentence she spoke.

Compare this fil;m to its spiritual forebears, BUS RILEY'S BACK IN TOWN or ALL FALL DOWN, and you'll not how the spirit of William Inge has mutated, albeit in a very charming and quirky way, so that we never find out why Ryan (excuse me, Ben McKenzie) has it in for his brother, nor why Ashley (Amy Adams) winds up being his opposite number in a sort of BRIEF ENCOUNTER doomed love scene at her hospital ward,The early scene of Adams and Embeth Davidtz sizing each other up on the couch is like a living, breathing ""tableau vivant"" in honor of Steven Spielberg, who discovered both actresses in very disparate projects, Adams in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, Davidtz indelible as the abused Jewish prisoner in SCHINDLER'S LIST.

953423,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000BYRCQU,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[7, 12]","Small towns throughout rural areas of America and elsewhere in the Western World have a distinct lifestyle that fosters a homogenous togetherness.  The people support one another, share the same gossip, and occasionally get together in mutual festivities.  Life is rather monotonous affair, as the people who live in these towns find comfort and safety in the familiar and habitual.  Whenever change comes about it faces both suspicion and disapproval, as it could possibly disrupt the routine for the people.  It is not that the people intend to be unpleasant, but it is their way of life they are trying to protect.  Junebug captures the essence of small town life where everyone knows everyone and the mundane has founds its roots.Even though the film is about small town living the story opens contrastingly in a Chicagoan art gallery where Madeleine (Embeth Davidtz) holds a benefit auction to support Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. During the benefit she lays her eyes on George (Alessandro Nivola) with whom she falls in love with and they quickly get married.  They continue their life without meeting the in-laws, but when Madeleine learns about the rural North Carolinian painter David Wark (Frank Hoyt Taylor) they decide visit George's parents who live nearby the painter.  In North Carolina Madeleine meets an eccentric painter that seems to have just stepped out of a time capsule from the 1800s.  His paintings also reflect strongly about the small town living, as he paints the freeing of the slaves while all slaves have white faces.  They have white faces, as David only paints faces he knows suggesting that he does not know any black people.The meeting with the in-laws for the first time, as all married couples can attest to, is a nerve-racking event.  At the same time, the in-laws and other relatives might find the moment equally uneasy, as they might fear the worst.  In Junebug, the parents are also deep-rooted individuals of the small town in which they live, which means they approach the meeting with reserved doubts.  However, Madeleine who grew up traveling the world welcomes the meeting with open arms, maybe a little too open for the taste of George's parents, Peg (Celia Weston) and Eugene (Scott Wilson).  George on the other hand seems to be the one who struggles most with the situation, as he wants to keep the peace by respecting the rules of the house while being aware of the ways of the town and he never complains.Phil Morrison seizes the very spirit of the small town family through Angus MacLachlan's meticulously detailed script, which never wavers in either the spoken language or the topics discussed.  For example, in the arrival scene to the parents George stays outside with Eugene looking at their Volvo's engine while laboriously trying to find something to talk about.  The scene is very short, but it does not let the audience off the hook.  Instead the scene vibrantly shows Eugene's grueling attempt to display emotions and liking for his son in a subtle and caring manner through the few words ""It's good you come down here"", which George recognizes.  It shows that they are not bad people; it is just very difficult for them to show emotions.  Meanwhile, Madeleine throws her arms around and kisses everyone on the cheeks in a very French manner, as a gesture to show her affections to them.  It is something completely foreign and new to the family, which throws them off more than feeling welcome.  Madeleine's demeanor slowly begins to build a wall between her and her in-laws.Madeleine also meets the welcoming and pregnant Ashley (Amy Adams) when they arrive who is married to George's younger brother Johnny (Benjamin McKenzie).  They live in the same house with Peg and Eugene.  Ashley acts in many regards like a 15-year old, as she curiously wants to know about the world and about Madeleine.  However, it is understandable, as she probably never lived by herself in her life, as she most likely moved from her parents' house to live with Johnny's parents.  In the process, Ashley's persona is quickly tossed in and the audience is faced with traits such as hyperactivity, dieting (the notion of dieting while being pregnant only makes one wonder about her sanity), childlike inquisitiveness, and constant need for attention.  These traits brings out an over the top character, but the situation requires such a character.  Amy Adams performs brilliantly, which has honored her with several awards for her dazzling performance including an Oscar nomination.George's brother Johnny is also an interesting character that displays an interesting persona.  Poor self-esteem is among the first things that ooze out of his character, as he lacks self-control and anger management.  Whenever things do not go as planned, it is always someone else's fault.  In addition, Madeleine's overt behavior to express her positive emotions through hugs and kisses on the cheeks are completely misinterpreted by Johnny who thinks she is coming on to him.  Instead of communicating, he assumes and ends up in an awkward situation, which only furthers his poor self-esteem.  The scene also helps provide notions that the small town living prevents people from understanding people coming from the outside into the town such as Madeleine.Morrison offers a cinematic experience that allows for close up examinations of the structure of a social environment in a small town.  Each character plays a significant part that highlights the different aspects of the social structure whether it is being an outsider or a different cohort within the setting.  The success with Junebug shines through in many parts, but most and foremost the script that is brought to life through a marvelous cast.  Morrison also shows vision and artistic quality that permits the audience to fully experience a small town through a family's existence.  It is clear that he has a strong understanding for the psychosocial workings of a small town, as he lets the audience experience a truly remarkable film about the mundane life in rural America.",5,...Remarkable Film About the Mundane Life in Rural America,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,6063,"['Small', 'towns', 'rural', 'areas', 'America', 'elsewhere', 'Western', 'World', 'have',

She and her husband George (Alessandro Nivola) drive down to North Carolina to meet him and then stay with George's family who live nearby.  In that house, Mom runs the show, Dad is invisible to everyone, and son Johnny is mad at the world in general and at his very pregnant wife Ashley (Amy Adams) in particular.This slice-of-life story takes us into the everyday life of the Johnsten family as seen through the eyes of an outsider.  Madeline is the fish-out-of-water in Bible-belt country; the most important thing in life to her is her gallery, but slowly her priorities change.  Embeth Davidtz  makes a lovely Madeline and Amy Adams easily steals all of her scenes as the sweet and silly Ashley.  George's character isn't developed, perhaps to leave more time to get to know his family.  They do come across as real people and we come to care about them all.  It's a sweet, insightful little story about people who could very well be the family next door, just living their lives.

His family lives in North Carolina and none of them show up for the wedding.  Six months later Madeleine is on the trail of a folk artist by the name of David Wark (Frank Hoyt Taylor) who happens to live in the same neck of the woods as George's family down by Winston-Salem.  So how hard can it be to travel with George back to his home, meet his family, and sign Wark to a contract?  Oh, Lordy, you have no idea.George's mom, Peg (Celia Weston), rules the roost, and if Madeline overhears her verdict that George's wife is a dangerous combination of good looks and intelligence, well that is just too damn bad.  Her husband, Eugene (Scott Wilson), does not have much to say and when he is not sitting in his basement carving wood he is trying to figure out where his Philips head screwdriver is hiding.  Then there is George's younger brother, Johnny (Ben McKenzie), who stops working under his car so he can study the Cliffs Notes for ""Huckleberry Finn.""  George has married his high school sweetheart, Ashley (Amy Adams), who talks more than every body else in the movie put together and is nine months pregnant.Besides whether or not Madeleine can sign Wark, a decidedly eccentric fellow who dreams poetry and paints slaves with white faces because he claims he has never met a black man, the driving question of ""Junebug"" is whether chatterbox Ashley is for real.  Madeleine is left to fend for herself with her new in-laws for most of the visit as she finds out what George was apparently happy to leave behind, and her chief strategy is to smile a lot and try and roll with the punches.  But it is Adams, whose Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress was a no-brainer given all the critic awards she has received (including the special jury dramatic prize at Sundance), who steals this movie from start to finish.  I have seen all five of the nominees in her category and I think Adams should win (not that she will, but she should).Director Phil Morrison and screenwriter Angus MacLachlan have been working together since 1990's ""Tater Tomater.""  With ""Junebug"" they bring together a bunch of characters and let them percolate.  After all, this is the south and being in a hurry is not the way people are supposed to be living their lives.  Through most of the movie we keep thinking that Ashley is some kind of joke; here she is, nine months pregnant, eating only a hot dog (boiled not grilled) with mustard (no bun) so she can watch her weight.  But she is the character who has married into this family who has depth and heart, and who touches us the most in the end.

Adams makes this character fully three dimensional.  I think Adams will have a great career ahead of her if she plays all of her roles like this.  Not only is Adams good, but there is not one person that does not shine in this film.  Embeth Davidtz is especially good.

While Amy Adams and Embeth Davidtz give excellent performances, the rest of the cast was given such constricted roles that they couldn't have made much of their characters even if they wanted to do so. The cinematography, on the other hand, is excellent and the plot moves along at a good pace--what little plot there is, I should mention.The film begins when the Chicagoan, highly sophisticated art gallery dealer Madeleine (Embeth Davidtz) meets and marries a guy from North Carolina, George Johnsten (Alessandro Nivola). It's not long before Madeleine hears of a reclusive, backward yet talented artist in North Carolina near where George grew up and where his family still lives. George and Madeleine then head for North Carolina to close a business deal with the artist and visit George's highly dysfunctional family.The moment Madeleine and George arrive, the oddball dynamics of George's family become rather obvious. The only person to warmly welcome Madeleine is Ashley (Amy Adams), George's pregnant sister-in-law. George's mother sees only the good in George while choosing to put down George's brother Johnny (Benjamin McKenzie) who has financial and emotional problems of his own. In fact, the whole family makes light of Johnny which makes Johnny's situation only worse. George's father Eugene (Scott Wilson) is rather introverted and the entire family is very keen on church-going which is not exactly Madeleine's style.All kinds of problems quickly surface; and we see a rather ""unwrapped"" family clinging to the church for emotional strength to get them through their unhappy lives. Madeleine also faces some difficulties getting the reclusive artist to sign a contract so that she can close her important business deal and represent him as an artist.Will Johnny and his brother George ever be able to resolve their differences? Will Ashley coax other members of the family to warm up to Madeleine? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!The DVD comes with a few extras: There is a running commentary with Amy Adams and Embeth Davidtz; and there are a few deleted scenes. There are also two casting sessions on the DVD for actors Amy Adams and Ben McKenzie. The ""behind the scenes"" mini-featurettes are somewhat superficial but a nice bonus anyway.Overall, Junebug is good but it could have been better. The script isn't as kind to the actors as it could have been and it hampers the actors' ability to give good performances with depth. I kept seeing so many one-dimensional characters on the screen and they could have and should have created at least a little bit of depth to these characters as the movie progressed.

953430,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000BYRCQU,Michael Butts,"[7, 14]","If there's any reason to watch JUNEBUG, its for Amy Adams.  Adams is brilliant and infuses every one of her scenes with a ferocious energy and independence.  Her portrayal of Ashley makes the film glow.  Alas, the movie itself is another one of those city slickers vs. country folks tales that always makes small town people look even more inept than ever. The relationships in the movie are never clearly explained or justified.  Why does Johnny hate his brother so much?  What is wrong with Eugene...does he have Alzheimer's?  Unfortunately, lost in this muddled mess are some other good performances, too:  Embeth Davidtz as citified Madeline does very well with her portrayal of a new in-law caught in the mechanisms of a close-minded family; Alessandro Nivola is very good as George, the older son whose decision to marry Davidtz doesn't meet well with his family's approval.

953432,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BYRCQU,mirasreviews,"[4, 8]","""Junebug"" is a family drama with the right amount of quirky comedy, liveliness, and heart to really engage the audience. Chicago art dealer Madeleine (Embeth Davidtz) and new husband George (Alessandro Nivola) head to North Carolina to woo an ""outsider"" artist to Madeleine's gallery and visit George's family nearby. Madeleine is a South African child of diplomats who grew up on three continents, while George is from a small Southern town whose citizens seem to rarely leave it. Meeting Madeleine for the first time, George's family have disparate, very characteristic reactions to her, as sister-in-law Ashley (Amy Adams) eagerly awaits the birth of her first child and her brooding husband Johnny (Ben McKenzie) does his best to ignore the visitors.Amy Adams has been much lauded for her portrayal of vivacious, child-like Ashley. Deservedly so. Ashley's joie de vivre and simple earnestness are captivating. But ""Junebug"" wouldn't be much of a film without Celia Watson's frigid, disapproving, but maternal Peg, the family matriarch, or Ben McKenzie's frustrated Johnny, who isn't enjoying living in his big brother's shadow for even a little while. Scott Wilson provides some occasional perspective on it all as George's father: quiet, steadfast Eugene. Alessandro Nivola doesn't have a lot to do, but hits the right notes when he does: thoughtful, modest, and passionate. ""Junebug"" is an enjoyable film with a nice balance of empathy, insight, comedy, and drama.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): Bonus features include 10 deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, casting sessions, a gallery, and an audio commentary. ""Behind the Scenes"" (17 min) has 5 parts: Amy Adams shows us the neighborhood in which they filmed, Alessandro Nivola talks about singing in the film, Ben McKenzie, Amy Adams and Celia Watson talk about their characters. ""Casting Sessions"" include early run-throughs of 2 scenes, one with Amy Adams (14 min) and one with Ben McKenzie (7 min), which I suppose were used to cast the film. ""Outsider Art Photo Gallery"" is a slideshow of paintings by fictional artist David Wark's, the ""outsider artist"" in the movie. The work was actually painted by Ann Wood for the movie. In the audio commentary with Amy Adams and Embeth Davidtz, the actresses discuss their characters and their recollections of the cast, crew, and filming.

Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[1, 4]","George and Madeleine Johnston (played by Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz -- I confess that while I am familiar with the latter I hadn't recognized Nivola from anything before this film) are two artsy individuals from Chicago who travel to the wilds of North Carolina.  Madeleine is an art house owner specializing in outsider art-- George just happens to be a native of the area where a new, prospective ""fringe"" painter has been noted, hence they take the opportunity to visit the Johnston's while in the area.Note: no reason is ever given as to why George has been gone for so many years or why his family was not present (invited?) at his nuptials.Madeleine, a British national who grew up all over the globe, takes warmly to Eugene (Scott Wilson) and Peg (Celia Weston), George's parents, his younger brother Johnny (Benjamin McKenzie) and his expansively expectant wife, Ashley (Amy Adams).  The father is weirdly withdrawn and is apparently henpecked to death by his chain-smoking, overbearing wife (acted to perfection by Weston).  Johnny is utterly unlikeable -- he's full of barely-contained rage, for reasons unexplained (although being tied down at such a young age likely presents enough justification).Amy Adams was tremendous as the sweet, beguiling young Ashley, who'd never travelled more than 15 miles from her hometown (I am sure) and harbors a bit of a pash for her sister-in-law, who defines glamour and grace in the eyes of the little hick.  Unforuntately she does the same regarding the other Johnstons -- Peg is intimidated by it and deeply suspicious besides; poor Angry Johnny finds it sexy (with briefly disastrous results).  The family faces a devastating crisis which everyone pulls through gracefully, except Madeleine, who's too busy wooing Wark(the freakish artist).Madeleine gleans multiple insights about her man, whom she married in relative haste; unfortunately the viewer gets to know very little of George, who is conspicuously absent for long stretches of the film.Frank Hoyt Taylor plays the eccentric, reclusive David Wark, the perhaps-autistic painter.  This character, I suspect, was lifted almost directly from the real-life fringe artist Henry Darger, whose ""Realms of the Unreal"" paintings and tales of the Vivian Girls closely mirrored Wark's warped visual interpretations of Civil War battles and vaguely Scriptural text notes.This movie takes the age-old themes of family duty, the interweaving of new members into established familiar constructs, and culture clashes and presents a thoroughly enjoyable tale.  George and Madeleine depart northward a little wiser and with a better mutual understanding; even Angry Johnny makes it up with adorable Ashley.If anything I wouldn't mind a sequel.",4,I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did!,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,2745,"['George', 'Madeleine', 'Johnston', 'played', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'confess', 'am', 'familiar', 'latter', 'had', ""n't"", 'recognized', 'Nivola', 'anything', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'artsy', 'individuals', 'Chicago', 'who', 'travel', 'wilds', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Madeleine', 'art', 'house', 'owner', 'specializing', 'outsider', 'art', 'George', 'just', 'be', 'native', 'area', 'where', 'new', 'prospective', 'fringe', 'painter', 'been', 'noted', 'hence', 'take', 'opportunity', 'visit', 'Johnston', 'while', 'area.Note', 'reason', 'ever', 'given', 'why', 'George', 'been', 'gone', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'why', 'family', 'was', 'not', 'present', 'invited', 'nuptials.Madeleine', 'British', 'national', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'globe', 'warmly', 'Eugene', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'Peg', 'Celia', 'Weston', 'George', 'parents', 'younger', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Benjamin', 'McKenzie', 'expansively', 'expectant', 'wife', 'Ashley', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'father', 'weirdly', 'withdrawn', 'apparently', 'henpecked', 'death', 'chain-smoking', 'overbearing', 'wife', 'acted', 'perfection', 'Weston', 'Johnny', 'utterly', 'unlikeable', 'full', 'barely-contained', 'rage', 'reasons', 'unexplained', 'being', 'tied', 'down', 'such', 'young', 'age', 'likely', 'presents', 'enough', 'justification', '.Amy', 'Adams', 'was', 'tremendous', 'sweet', 'beguiling', 'young', 'Ashley', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'travelled', 'more', '15', 'miles', 'hometown', 'am', 'sure', 'bit', 'pash', 'sister-in-law', 'who', 'glamour', 'grace', 'eyes', 'little', 'hick', 'Unforuntately', 'same', 'regarding', 'other', 'Johnstons', 'Peg', 'intimidated', 'deeply', 'suspicious', 'besides', 'poor', 'Angry', 'Johnny', 'briefly', 'disastrous', 'results', 'family', 'devastating', 'crisis', 'everyone', 'gracefully', 'Madeleine', 'who', 'too', 'busy', 'wooing', 'Wark', 'freakish', 'artist', '.Madeleine', 'gleans', 'multiple', 'insights', 'man', 'whom', 'married', 'relative', 'haste', 'unfortunately', 'viewer', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'George', 'who', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'long', 'stretches', 'film.Frank', 'Hoyt', 'Taylor', 'eccentric', 'reclusive', 'David', 'Wark', 'perhaps-autistic', 'painter', 'character', 'suspect', 'was', 'lifted', 'almost', 'directly', 'real-life', 'fringe', 'artist', 'Henry', 'Darger', 'Realms', 'Unreal', 'paintings', 'tales', 'Vivian', 'Girls', 'closely', 'mirrored', 'Wark', 'warped', 'visual', 'interpretations', 'Civil', 'War', 'battles', 'vaguely', 'Scriptural', 'text', 'notes.This', 'movie', 'age-old', 'themes', 'family', 'duty', 'interweaving', 'new', 'members', 'established', 'familiar', 'constructs', 'culture', 'clashes', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'tale', 'George', 'Madeleine', 'depart', 'little', 'wiser', 'better', 'mutual', 'understanding', 'even', 'Angry', 'Johnny', 'up', 'adorable', 'Ashley.If', 'anything', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sequel']",Junebug

953441,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000BYRCQU,Peter Shermeta,"[3, 7]","This is one of the rare occasions that I have a difficult time actually deciding if I liked a movie or not. The distinction, I guess, could be made by clarifying the wording of the question. Did I enjoy the movie? No, not really. Did I enjoy the story? Not particularly. Did I enjoy the message? I did.To overuse the word ""important"" and its variations, I think any story that highlights the importance of family is an important one to see. I would not say that the concept of family is often undervalued, but I would argue that too many times it goes overlooked. Too many movies make money in today's society by focusing on familial faults and their individual disfunctionalities. I admit that I am part of the problem; I support the very movies I describe above. But I can still appreciate the once-in-a-blue-moon appearance of a movie like Junebug.The movie was drawn out by many (I feel) unnecessary ""artsy"" camera shots. Full clips of the neighbor woman walking up her yard to her house. Cut scenes to the bugs flying over a small patch of wildflowers. Maybe these were avenues through which the makers of the movie were able to express themselves, but they succeeded in doing nothing more than taking a movie with a too-slow-to-develop plot and draw it out.The story has left me with some internal conflict. I cannot decide if I am frustrated with the fact that there was much more to the relationships within the family than we are shown or if I actually preferred it that way. Johnny harbors an incredible amount of resentment towards his brother. Is it because George is the all-American son, liked by everyone in town, though he chose to leave North Carolina for more Midwestern surroundings? Or is there more to it? It would surely help us to understand the characters better if we could have a brief monologue by someone to describe for us a few major events that happened years before this story takes place.The flip side of the coin is that we are better off being left to our own imaginative and investigative devices. If you do not opt to watch Junebug alone, as I unfortunately did, there could be some wonderful conversation born from the movie. This theory is maybe the strongest influence from which I recommend Junebug.The synopsis provided with the DVD highlights the performances by Amy Adams and Ben McKenzie.

953442,A2GKXBLXBYLXTR,B000BYRCQU,"Porter ""moonlightbingerased""","[6, 11]","There is no denying that Phil Morrison's ""Junebug"" is raw, real and true. The film is free of the incessant emotional roller coaster that is common films made with lack of true feelings and the very emotion that it's reaching for as the sountrack purrs in the audiences ear signaling the cue for tears or laughter. By the time you've come to the unrealistically perfect end you've been told exactly what to feel regardless of your personal taste and views.Luckily great films are still occasionally made and ""Junebug"" has more life hiding in the dressing rooms than in many American films entire production. The film makers simply invite us to spend one weekend in the life of a family, and the climax is the entire film, every simple, straightforward frame of it.The film begins with Madeleine, an art dealer from Chicago, meeting George and they fall in love. Later, on a trip to North Carolina to meet up with an artist named David Wark, they stop by to visit George's family who live near their destination.George's family are an interesting bunch we learn for ourselves just before the couple arrives. Peg, his mother, is a strong and forward woman who maintains a nice house. Eugene, his father, is a withdrawn and kind man who spends his time in his wood shop in the basement. Johnny, George's brother, is also quiet but for different reasons as if afraid of what he might say or because he's to disenchanted to put together words. And Ashley, Johnny's sweet, innocent, relentlessly upbeat girlfriend. She is pregnant and longing for Johnny's appreciation and forming a bond with Madeleine, whom she's impatienly eager to meet.Upon Madeleine's meeting the family it's clear of the family's personality and intentions, she immediately admires them. She humors Ashley by staying up late and allowing her to paint her toenails. She gives her advice on the pregnancy and her relationship with the distant Johnny. She shares a quiet bond with Eugene who admires her good quality. She tries to help Johnny with studying for his GED exam. He mistakes her kindness and interest for affection, the kind he lacks with Ashley, which could be rooted to his fear and exitement of having a child.In the short time she knows these people she forms such a strong bond that when she finally has the chance to acquire David Wark's artwork she is forced to make a difficult decision to either meet with Wark or sacrifice the professional opportunity and be with the family at Ashley's side while she's giving labor.Ultimately she goes to meet Wark and Ashley loses the baby. Madeleine is crushed. Ashley is devastated. These are experiences real people go through; regret, loss, heartbreak and Morrison delivers these moments with brilliant honesty.There are many great moments in this film like the scene in the hospital with Ashley and George after she's lost the baby, the dialog is heartbreaking but not without hope, and not the hope forced onto characters in other films by just the right music on the soundtrack and the realization that the film is ending with the appropriate tone, but real hope from real people who are uncertain if tomorrow will be better but knowing that you just have to keep living any how.My favorite moment in the film is a scene during Ashley's baby shower. Johnny is sitting on the couch downstairs watching television when he comes upon a documentary on merecats, Ashley's favorite animal. He yells for her but she's engrossed in the party so he frantically hurries to find a tape to record the program. His actions are in vain though, he can not get it to record because the tab was removed. He gets angry and when Ashley comes down and explains his mistake he smashes the tape and goes back into depressive silence. Ashley says to him ""God loves you just the way you are, but he loves you too much to let you stay that way"".""Junebug"" is a great film that ends the way it begins with the individuals living their lives, all of them seemily the same but somewhere deep inside, as with every human being, they have been affected by the events of their lives. The great films know that we don't need it spelled out for us.Thanks ""Junebug"".",5,The Undeniable Truth,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,4160,"['denying', 'Phil', 'Morrison', 'Junebug', 'raw', 'real', 'true', 'film', 'free', 'incessant', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'common', 'films', 'made', 'lack', 'true', 'feelings', 'very', 'emotion', 'reaching', 'sountrack', 'purrs', 'audiences', 'ear', 'signaling', 'cue', 'tears', 'laughter', 'time', ""'ve"", 'come', 'unrealistically', 'perfect', 'end', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'exactly', 'what', 'feel', 'regardless', 'personal', 'taste', 'views.Luckily', 'great', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'occasionally', 'made', 'Junebug', 'more', 'life', 'hiding', 'dressing', 'rooms', 'many', 'American', 'films', 'entire', 'production', 'film', 'makers', 'simply', 'invite', 'spend', 'one', 'weekend', 'life', 'family', 'climax', 'entire', 'film', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'frame', 'it.The', 'film', 'Madeleine', 'art', 'dealer', 'Chicago', 'meeting', 'George', 'fall', 'love', 'Later', 'trip', 'North', 'Carolina', 'meet', 'up', 'artist', 'named', 'David', 'Wark', 'stop', 'visit', 'George', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'destination.George', 'family', 'are', 'interesting', 'bunch', 'learn', 'ourselves', 'just', 'couple', 'Peg', 'mother', 'strong', 'forward', 'woman', 'who', 'nice', 'house', 'Eugene', 'father', 'withdrawn', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'time', 'wood', 'shop', 'basement', 'Johnny', 'George', 'brother', 'also', 'quiet', 'different', 'reasons', 'afraid', 'what', 'might', 'say', 'disenchanted', 'put', 'together', 'words', 'Ashley', 'Johnny', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'relentlessly', 'upbeat', 'girlfriend', 'pregnant', 'longing', 'Johnny', 'appreciation', 'forming', 'bond', 'Madeleine', 'whom', 'impatienly', 'eager', 'meet.Upon', 'Madeleine', 'meeting', 'family', 'clear', 'family', 'personality', 'intentions', 'immediately', 'humors', 'Ashley', 'staying', 'up', 'late', 'allowing', 'paint', 'toenails', 'advice', 'pregnancy', 'relationship', 'distant', 'Johnny', 'shares', 'quiet', 'bond', 'Eugene', 'who', 'good', 'quality', 'help', 'Johnny', 'studying', 'GED', 'exam', 'kindness', 'interest', 'affection', 'kind', 'Ashley', 'could', 'be', 'rooted', 'fear', 'exitement', 'having', 'child.In', 'short', 'time', 'people', 'strong', 'bond', 'when', 'finally', 'chance', 'acquire', 'David', 'Wark', 'artwork', 'forced', 'make', 'difficult', 'decision', 'meet', 'Wark', 'sacrifice', 'professional', 'opportunity', 'be', 'family', 'Ashley', 'side', 'giving', 'labor.Ultimately', 'meet', 'Wark', 'Ashley', 'baby', 'Madeleine', 'crushed', 'Ashley', 'devastated', 'are', 'experiences', 'real', 'people', 'go', 'regret', 'loss', 'heartbreak', 'Morrison', 'delivers', 'moments', 'brilliant', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'moments', 'film', 'scene', 'hospital', 'Ashley', 'George', 'lost', 'baby', 'dialog', 'heartbreaking', 'not', 'hope', 'not', 'hope', 'forced', 'characters', 'other', 'films', 'just', 'right', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'realization', 'film', 'ending', 'appropriate', 'tone', 'real', 'hope', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'uncertain', 'tomorrow', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'knowing', 'just', 'have', 'keep', 'living', 'how.My', 'favorite', 'moment', 'film', 'scene', 'Ashley', 'baby', 'shower', 'Johnny', 'sitting', 'couch', 'downstairs', 'watching', 'television', 'when', 'documentary', 'merecats', 'Ashley', 'favorite', 'animal', 'engrossed', 'party', 'frantically', 'find', 'tape', 'record', 'program', 'actions', 'are', 'vain', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'record', 'tab', 'was', 'removed', 'angry', 'when', 'Ashley', 'down', 'mistake', 'tape', 'back', 'depressive', 'silence', 'Ashley', 'God', 'just', 'way', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'let', 'stay', 'way', 'Junebug', 'great', 'film', 'way', 'individuals', 'living', 'lives', 'seemily', 'same', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'inside', 'human', 'being', 'have', 'been', 'affected', 'events', 'lives', 'great', 'films', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'spelled', 'out', 'us.Thanks', 'Junebug']",Junebug
953443,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B000BYRCQU,"Promise ""promise""","[10, 13]","This is a perfect film.  The script is so smart.  I loved the idea that the well-educated, cosmopolitan Madeleine runs a gallery that features ""outsider art.""  A psychologist would say that she's looking for her own dark side.  She's so polished and perfect that it's almost painful to look at her. No extra body fat on those bones. No wonder she is attracted to the art of those who are demented (one is autistic), delusional, etc.  No wonder she falls in love with the sweet southern boy who comes from a mayonnaise eating, cigarette smoking family.  His mother has hips big enough for all of them!For his part, the male lead,(sorry I can't remember his name, but he's great!) for all of his sermonizing on the importance of family, has obviously left this life behind for the Big City and the Big City lady!  It's perfect.  Opposites attract and then they have to deal with what their attracted to.Madeline loves the crazed primitive artist, but she sees him as a commodity.  When she's faced with the real deal---the culture that spawned this art, she can't quite fathom it. She chooses the representation of the culture over the actual values, when she goes to close the deal with the artist instead of being with the family in the hospital.  But this is her culture and the movie doesn't come down too hard on her for her decision.  It seems to just show it like it is.The film makers are to be strongly commended for not presenting us with another patronizing picture of Southern Christians!!!!!  The scene where the male lead sings a hymn is gorgeous!Indeed much of the beauty of the film is the deep respect with which each character is presented.  That's what saves it and that's what brings us to a hopeful feeling at the end.  Yes, the male lead sees the fault of his wife but he sees beyond it, too, and they drive off happilly into the sunset together.  His mother loves him and he's able to pass that love on to the woman of his choice.All the actors were first rate.  I especially loved the father....before he uttered a word, his face and posture spoke volumes!Everything in this film is done with just the right tone.

Guess Roger feels superior in his Chicago office surrounded by his Liberal pals.What's with the title of this film, Junebug?  You make a film and you want people to see it, but you name it Junebug and nobody shows up.  I wonder why?The premise, intellectual art dealer Madeline with the British accent marries George a Chicago man about town with roots in North Carolina.  Because Madeline wants a primitive artist near George's family home to show at her gallery, the newlyweds go Down South.  The artist turns out to be an old coot with an accent so thick I couldn't figure out what he was saying.  His paintings were primitive all right, concentrating on the male organ in ecstasy with variations of Civil War castration. Yeah, that version of primitive Southern artists could only be thought up in Hollywood or Chicago.Anyhow, George's family is bananas.  Gad, they go to church and believe in God.  The mom thinks Madeline is too pretty, maybe interested in her youngest son, the underachieving Johnny.  Johnny isn't too smart, but he knows when a woman is coming on to him, or does he.  Gad, now we're in an Eugene O'Neil family saga full of incestuous angst.  So these cultural misunderstandings provide the ironies, the laughs.

953447,A3K28Y9KMGEV7B,B000BYRCQU,R. Knapp,"[9, 11]","Junebug is a movie showing off the skills and talents of all involved. Actors act, revealing deep characters. The director directs, bringing the audience into the film and ensuring a proper blending of characters. Sound, cinematography, and costuming are artfully used to engage the audience in mood and attitude. That's what movies are all about, isn't it? Well... it also seems that's what movies have been lacking lately. Junebug is a movie that gives me hope we are transending hype and moving toward substance.Yet, this film apparently failed with the theater audience. Read the negative reviews to learn why. Audiences like movies with resolution. Instead, Junebug looks at passages. We see change. We see realities faced and choices made. But we do not see what follows. It leaves us thinking. It left me uneasy. I like it. It enriches me.What's Junebug about? It's about culture clash. It's about people realizing who they are, where they come from, where they are now, and where they want to be. We see a couple, compatible where they are at the moment, falling in love, marrying quickly after a whorlwind romance, then getting to know each other in context. By the end of the movie, the honeymoon is over. We leave this couple knowing of their committment to each other, but not knowing how or if they can sort out the problem of living together. (But that's only one of the stories going on.)We see beauty in our characters, and we see ugliness. There are no heroes, there are no villians-- only human beings. One genius is the ability to reveal so much about every character in it, including cameo characters like the neighbor across the street. Another genius is its composition: scenes, scene changes, timing, use of cinematography and sound, etc. And yet another genius is its resistance to judgement. A final genius is that, rather than ending as I wanted it to end, Junebug ends as is should end. Rather than giving me what I want, it does the Right Thing (a brave act in movie-making as well as in life).This movie is about people and life. It's not about competition of good and evil, or us and them-- although such are addressed. The movie is tight, concise. Acting is well-done and very evenly done. (Amy Adams plays, perhaps, the only 'endearing' character, but even that is qualified.) Junebug is a comedy in the sense that people are amusing. It is a drama in the sense that life is dramatic.Enjoy it!",5,Genius!

AMAZING---- MOST OF IT IS SO BRILLIANT THE FEW PROBLEMS I HAD W IT--- ARE NOT EVEN WORTH MENTIONING----everything about it seems inspired ---- a great collaborative work-- well worth the effort of all involved---  i must say - to the actresses who do the enjoyable/chatty commentary-- you were both giggling over what i think was the most real and poignant acting moment in the movie --- the prize for the best scene-- and it was only a moment-- was the great character actress who played the autistic artist`s sister----i apologize for not mentioning all yer names- when she says to the girlfriend how sorry she is about the family`s tragedy---in the car-- she says it with such real emotion--so real it made me cry---instantly--- truly for me the best moment in a movie filled w great moments--the scenes of the dad in the basement-- doing his wood work--almost hiding - in the basement-- but still being there absorbing the drama of his family--- rooting it somehow- grounding it ---a moment of him looking up the stairs-- waiting almost for it to settle--- before he ascends up into it---moments of brilliance like this thoughout- but kudos to amy of course- the mother the younger son- scott as the father- who i will never forget for his role in another real masterpiece in cold blood ! now theres a perfect movie !!! and the actress who played the girlfriend--- she had some amazing moments too--- i think it is a testament  to the directors genius-- both commenting actresses in total agreement and the open heartedness of the brilliant writer who let amy use what turns out to be one of the best lines in the movie----when amy says to her husband-- god loves you the way u are but he loves u too much for you to stay that way !!!! or something like that-- it turns out amy heard that line in a nearby church and asked to use it-- perfect !! this kind of synchronicity i truly believes happens when creative and open hearted people have the good fortune of all coming together to create something worth doing--- spirit joins in on it -- and we are all richer for it--- to the people who didnt see the value in this wonderful movie--- the many layers -- socio economic and culture clashes--the theme of longing that the actresses talk about in the commentary how people repress so much but live on in hope and in earnestness-- how much religion means to these sweet people-- how the movie captures so much so well-- the scenes in the church - the singing-- the faces and emotions so present--- i feel sorry for anyone who can sit thru this movie and not be moved and touched by its great charm and spirit----great job and much heart felt praise to everyone who worked on this movie--,5,A REAL GEM,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,3207,"['WONDERFUL', 'AND', 'AMAZINGLY', 'WELL', 'DONE', 'MOVIE', 'EVERYTHING', 'MOVIE', 'LIKE', 'CLOONEYS', 'ABOUT', 'EDWARD', 'R', 'MURROW', 'other', 'nonsense', 'history', 'violence', 'EVERYTHING', 'LACKED', 'IS', 'HERE', 'IN', 'THIS', 'GREAT', 'casting', 'begin', 'ACTING', 'WRITING', 'art', 'direction', 'everything', '-AND', 'course', 'DIRECTING', 'THE', 'DIRECTOR', 'HAD', 'VISION', 'AND', 'REHEARSED', 'SCENES', 'UNTIL', 'HE', 'GOT', 'WHAT', 'HE', 'WANTED', 'REAL', 'STUFF', 'TOUCHING', 'FUNNY', 'SAD', 'JUST', 'BRILLIANT', 'ESP', 'SOMETHING', 'SHOT', 'W', 'NO', 'MONEY', 'THEY', 'SAY', 'AND', 'IN', 'ABOUT', 'FIVE', 'WEEKS', 'AMAZING', 'MOST', 'IT', 'IS', 'SO', 'BRILLIANT', 'THE', 'FEW', 'PROBLEMS', 'HAD', 'W', 'IT', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'EVEN', 'WORTH', 'MENTIONING', 'everything', 'inspired', 'great', 'collaborative', 'work', 'well', 'effort', 'involved', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'actresses', 'who', 'do', 'enjoyable/chatty', 'commentary', 'were', 'giggling', 'what', 'i', 'think', 'was', 'most', 'real', 'poignant', 'acting', 'moment', 'movie', 'prize', 'best', 'scene', 'was', 'only', 'moment', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'autistic', 'artist', 's', 'sister', 'i', 'apologize', 'not', 'mentioning', 'yer', 'names-', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'how', 'sorry', 'family', 's', 'tragedy', '-in', 'car', 'such', 'real', 'emotion', 'so', 'real', 'made', 'cry', '-instantly', 'truly', 'best', 'moment', 'movie', 'filled', 'w', 'great', 'moments', 'scenes', 'dad', 'basement', 'doing', 'wood', 'work', 'almost', 'hiding', 'basement', 'still', 'being', 'there', 'absorbing', 'drama', 'family', 'rooting', 'somehow-', 'grounding', '-a', 'moment', 'looking', 'up', 'stairs', 'waiting', 'almost', 'settle', 'up', '-moments', 'brilliance', 'thoughout-', 'amy', 'course-', 'mother', 'younger', 'son-', 'scott', 'father-', 'who', 'i', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'role', 'real', 'masterpiece', 'cold', 'blood', 'now', 'perfect', 'movie', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'amazing', 'moments', 'too', 'i', 'think', 'testament', 'directors', 'genius', 'commenting', 'actresses', 'total', 'agreement', 'open', 'heartedness', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'who', 'let', 'amy', 'use', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'when', 'amy', 'husband', 'god', 'way', 'u', 'are', 'u', 'too', 'much', 'stay', 'way', 'something', 'out', 'amy', 'heard', 'line', 'nearby', 'church', 'asked', 'use', 'perfect', 'kind', 'synchronicity', 'i', 'truly', 'happens', 'when', 'creative', 'open', 'hearted', 'people', 'have', 'good', 'fortune', 'coming', 'together', 'create', 'something', 'worth', 'doing', 'spirit', 'are', 'richer', 'people', 'who', 'didnt', 'see', 'value', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'many', 'layers', 'socio', 'economic', 'culture', 'clashes', 'theme', 'longing', 'actresses', 'talk', 'commentary', 'how', 'people', 'repress', 'so', 'much', 'live', 'hope', 'earnestness', 'how', 'much', 'religion', 'sweet', 'people', 'how', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'well', 'scenes', 'church', 'singing', 'emotions', 'so', 'present', 'i', 'feel', 'sorry', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'sit', 'thru', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'touched', 'great', 'charm', 'spirit', 'great', 'job', 'much', 'heart', 'felt', 'praise', 'everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'movie']",Junebug

953450,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000BYRCQU,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","""Junebug"" is a complex and understated variant on that old story about the mouse from the city who goes to visit the mouse from the country.  In this case, the city mouse is Madeleine, a Chicago art galley proprietress, who travels to rural North Carolina with her new husband, George, to meet his family and try to sign on a talented artist who lives in the area at the same time.  But as often happens when a newcomer tries to enter into an already established family dynamic (especially when that family comes from an entirely different social background), Madeleine discovers that there is often more going on than meets the eye and that acceptance is not always easy to achieve.It isn't for want of trying, for Madeleine does her best to break through the emotional barriers George's mother and resentful younger brother have put up for her.  George's father, Eugene, is a laid back, live-and-let-live type who pretty much allows his wife, Peg, to run the household and maintain harmony in the family.  But for Peg, who is fiercely private when it comes to the business of her loved ones, her vision of  ""harmony"" does not include the sudden intrusion into their little unit of an educated, highly sophisticated ""city woman,"" with whom she believes George has little to nothing in common.  She treats Madeleine with a chilly politeness and a barely disguised contempt that leaves the newcomer in little doubt as to how unwelcome she really is.  However, Madeleine perseveres, making a strong effort to be pleasant and ingratiate herself into the family.  She actually receives very little support in this endeavor from George, who spends most of his time off wandering aimlessly around the area by himself, leaving Madeleine to deal with the hostility alone.  When, late in the film, George tries to make Madeleine feel guilty about something by saying that family needs to come first and be the most important thing to her, we in the audience feel like telling him off ourselves, since it has obviously been SHE who has been making all the effort at establishing familial relations with his folks.  Yet, it is just this kind of complex characterization that makes ""Junebug"" a richer, deeper film.  It doesn't spell out all the deep feelings and motivations for us nor does it resolve all the problems in a contrived way in the end.  For instance, we certainly sense Johnny's intense resentment of his older brother, yet we are never given specific reasons for it, nor is their any attempt to artificially heal the wound that exists between them.The one bright element in Madeleine's stay is her sister-in-law, Ashley, a relentlessly perky and upbeat young woman who fell in love with Johnny in high school and can't understand why it is he's turned away from her now just as she's about to have his baby.  At first, Ashley threatens to become the stereotype of an airhead country girl filled with starstruck notions of the glamour of big city life (hence why she is so intensely drawn to Madeleine), but, as the movie goes on, she develops into a complex character overflowing with doubts, hopes and fears.Writer Angus MacLachlan and director Phil Morrison are to be commended for providing characters that refuse to be pigeonholed, even if that means we feel frustrated at times because we can't always tell where each person is coming from at any given moment.  As with most films that venture away from the coastal cities and into the less familiar terrain of the American heartland, there is a slight tendency on the part of the moviemakers to look askance at some of the rituals and to be somewhat condescending in their tone.  That happens just a little bit in ""Junebug,"" though, for the most part, MacLachlan and Morrison deal fairly with their people and even acknowledge the place that church and faith play in their lives.  One of the most moving scenes occurs when George sings a hymn at a local church function, stunning Madeleine into realizing that there are many things she still doesn't know about the man she loves.The performances are all excellent, especially those of the women.  As Madeleine, Embeth Davidtz captures the complex reactions of a woman who genuinely wants to be accepted into a world that is largely alien to her but who is stymied at virtually every turn.  She wins us over with her unfailing good cheer in the face of daunting odds.  As Peg, Madeleine's biggest obstacle in that respect, Celia Weston brilliantly plays all her cards close to her vest, allowing us only momentary glimpses into the caring woman that lies beneath the abrasive, emotionally shut-down surface she offers to the outside world.  Yet, it is Amy Adams, in her Oscar-nominated performance as Ashley, who rivets our attention in the film.  She manages to make a seemingly empty-headed, starry-eyed woman complex and fascinating.  On the male side, Alessandro Nivola as George, Benjamin McKenzie as Johnny, and veteran actor Scott Wilson as Eugene all create characters who convey their feelings through indirection and understatement.And that pretty much sums up ""Junebug"" as a whole.  It allows us to observe its characters, warts and all, without expectations and without judgment.  And that's what makes the film so very interesting to watch.",4,understated view of a troubled family,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,5261,"['Junebug', 'complex', 'understated', 'variant', 'old', 'story', 'mouse', 'city', 'who', 'visit', 'mouse', 'country', 'case', 'city', 'mouse', 'Madeleine', 'Chicago', 'art', 'galley', 'proprietress', 'who', 'rural', 'North', 'Carolina', 'new', 'husband', 'George', 'meet', 'family', 'try', 'sign', 'talented', 'artist', 'who', 'area', 'same', 'time', 'often', 'when', 'newcomer', 'tries', 'enter', 'already', 'established', 'family', 'dynamic', 'especially', 'when', 'family', 'entirely', 'different', 'social', 'background', 'Madeleine', 'often', 'more', 'going', 'meets', 'eye', 'acceptance', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'achieve.It', ""n't"", 'want', 'trying', 'Madeleine', 'best', 'break', 'emotional', 'barriers', 'George', 'mother', 'resentful', 'younger', 'brother', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'George', 'father', 'Eugene', 'laid', 'back', 'live-and-let-live', 'type', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'wife', 'Peg', 'run', 'household', 'maintain', 'harmony', 'family', 'Peg', 'who', 'fiercely', 'private', 'when', 'business', 'loved', 'ones', 'vision', 'harmony', 'not', 'include', 'sudden', 'intrusion', 'little', 'unit', 'educated', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'city', 'woman', 'whom', 'George', 'little', 'nothing', 'common', 'Madeleine', 'chilly', 'politeness', 'barely', 'disguised', 'contempt', 'newcomer', 'little', 'doubt', 'how', 'unwelcome', 'really', 'However', 'Madeleine', 'making', 'strong', 'effort', 'be', 'pleasant', 'ingratiate', 'family', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'support', 'endeavor', 'George', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'off', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'area', 'leaving', 'Madeleine', 'deal', 'hostility', 'alone', 'When', 'late', 'film', 'George', 'make', 'Madeleine', 'feel', 'guilty', 'something', 'saying', 'family', 'come', 'first', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'audience', 'feel', 'telling', 'off', 'obviously', 'been', 'SHE', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'effort', 'establishing', 'familial', 'relations', 'folks', 'Yet', 'just', 'kind', 'complex', 'characterization', 'Junebug', 'richer', 'deeper', 'film', ""n't"", 'spell', 'out', 'deep', 'feelings', 'motivations', 'resolve', 'problems', 'contrived', 'way', 'end', 'instance', 'certainly', 'sense', 'Johnny', 'intense', 'resentment', 'older', 'brother', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'specific', 'reasons', 'attempt', 'artificially', 'heal', 'wound', 'them.The', 'one', 'bright', 'element', 'Madeleine', 'stay', 'sister-in-law', 'Ashley', 'relentlessly', 'perky', 'upbeat', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'Johnny', 'high', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'turned', 'away', 'now', 'just', 'about', 'have', 'baby', 'first', 'Ashley', 'become', 'stereotype', 'airhead', 'country', 'girl', 'filled', 'starstruck', 'notions', 'glamour', 'big', 'city', 'life', 'hence', 'why', 'so', 'intensely', 'drawn', 'Madeleine', 'movie', 'complex', 'character', 'overflowing', 'doubts', 'hopes', 'fears.Writer', 'Angus', 'MacLachlan', 'director', 'Phil', 'Morrison', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'providing', 'characters', 'refuse', 'be', 'pigeonholed', 'even', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'tell', 'where', 'person', 'coming', 'given', 'moment', 'most', 'films', 'venture', 'away', 'coastal', 'cities', 'less', 'familiar', 'terrain', 'American', 'heartland', 'slight', 'tendency', 'part', 'moviemakers', 'look', 'askance', 'rituals', 'be', 'somewhat', 'condescending', 'tone', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'Junebug', 'most', 'part', 'MacLachlan', 'Morrison', 'deal', 'fairly', 'people', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'place', 'church', 'faith', 'play', 'lives', 'One', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'when', 'George', 'hymn', 'local', 'church', 'function', 'stunning', 'Madeleine', 'realizing', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'still', ""n't"", 'know', 'man', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'women', 'Madeleine', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'complex', 'reactions', 'woman', 'who', 'genuinely', 'be', 'accepted', 'world', 'largely', 'alien', 'who', 'stymied', 'virtually', 'turn', 'unfailing', 'good', 'cheer', 'face', 'daunting', 'odds', 'Peg', 'Madeleine', 'biggest', 'obstacle', 'respect', 'Celia', 'Weston', 'brilliantly', 'cards', 'close', 'vest', 'allowing', 'only', 'momentary', 'glimpses', 'caring', 'woman', 'abrasive', 'emotionally', 'shut-down', 'surface', 'outside', 'world', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'Ashley', 'who', 'attention', 'film', 'make', 'seemingly', 'empty-headed', 'starry-eyed', 'woman', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'male', 'side', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'George', 'Benjamin', 'McKenzie', 'Johnny', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'Eugene', 'create', 'characters', 'who', 'convey', 'feelings', 'indirection', 'understatement.And', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'Junebug', 'whole', 'observe', 'characters', 'warts', 'expectations', 'judgment', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch']",Junebug

At the center are two sisters-in-law, one of them a Chicago gallery owner and the other a very pregnant teenager, whose dithering talk and boundless optimism represent the opposite of urban sophistication.While they are drawn together, their husbands continue an ages-old sibling rivalry, pitting the wits and charm of a handsome, successful older brother against the barely suppressed rage of the younger, a high school dropout and unwilling father-to-be, content with a minimum wage job. Circumstances put all four of them plus the brothers' parents, under the same roof for several summer days. The mix is Checkovian and, as driven by family ties, so are the results.

This one is quality and will stick with you. Be prepared, though, to not be terribly satisfied from a ""happy-ending"" perspective. But you will walk away enriched.I thought the film presented a complex picture of the South, and pointed out that there are aspects of that religiously-infused, family-oriented culture that are laudable, and that big-city cosmopolitans sometimes lose sight of what's important. Some reviewers here said that it paints a negative picture of Southerners. I don't think that the Southerners' negative characteristics are necessarily attributable to their ""Southernness."" And you could also say that there are some less-than-desirable traits of the city woman (can't remember her name right now). Also, that scene at the church is amazing, and has to be the best treatment of evangelical Protestantism I've seen in a major film. Very fair and interesting, and goes beyond shallow treatment and into appreciation. So the ending isn't satisfying? Sometimes life isn't satisfying. I think the character of George is horribly underdeveloped, and that's the biggest weakness here. Amy Adams' character copes with a crappy life by being sweet and optimistic.

953459,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000BYRCQU,Timothy Kearney,"[5, 8]","JUNEBUG has a quality to it you can't help but love. It tells a simple story. Madeline (Embeth Davidtz) is an art dealer from Chicago interested in a North Carolina folk artist. She wants to represent him and goes to meet him in person. Her husband George (Allesandro Nivola) decides it might be time she meets his family: his quite father Eugene (Scott Wilson), his somewhat difficult mother (Celia Watson), his lovable but emotionally starving sister in law Ashley (Amy Adams) and his distant brother Johnny (Ben McKenzie). The film deals with the unexpected visit and the impending birth of Ashley and Johnny's first child.The strength of the film is that it has a natural flow and feel to it. Madeleine is both intrigued by her husband's family yet we see she doesn't belong. George returns home but we know in some ways he can never return home. There is sibling rivalry, but we're not exactly sure of the cause and the in-law relationship seems natural. There are questions we want answered such as why George left and why he hadn't returned in at least three years, but not having an answer makes the film more believable. Throughout we feel as if we're right at home and in the center of the film.I remember at Oscar time, some critics believing that JUNEBUG was wrongfully overlooked. Many people who saw the film in theatres or have viewed it since being released on DVD agree. The performances are good. Amy Adams as Ashley is perhaps the best performance. Ashley could have been overbearing but Adams plays her as a sweet and vulnerable person we can't help buy feel for and love. A surprise was Benjamin McKenzie. Prior to JUNEBUG, I only associated him with television's The OC, but in this film we see he is a young star with talent (actually since I haven't seen more than five minutes of THE OC, I suppose I can't judge). Another great moment is a small scene at a church supper. George gets up and sings the hymn ""Softly and Tenderly."" I'm not sure if it's lip-synched or if Novola is doing his own vocals, but it's a great treat in an enjoyable film.",5,A Simple and Understated Film,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,2069,"['JUNEBUG', 'quality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'simple', 'story', 'Madeline', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'art', 'dealer', 'Chicago', 'interested', 'North', 'Carolina', 'folk', 'artist', 'represent', 'meet', 'person', 'husband', 'George', 'Allesandro', 'Nivola', 'might', 'be', 'time', 'family', 'quite', 'father', 'Eugene', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'mother', 'Celia', 'Watson', 'lovable', 'emotionally', 'starving', 'sister', 'law', 'Ashley', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'distant', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Ben', 'McKenzie', 'film', 'deals', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'impending', 'birth', 'Ashley', 'Johnny', 'first', 'child.The', 'strength', 'film', 'natural', 'flow', 'feel', 'Madeleine', 'intrigued', 'husband', 'family', 'yet', 'see', ""n't"", 'belong', 'George', 'home', 'know', 'ways', 'can', 'never', 'return', 'home', 'sibling', 'rivalry', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'cause', 'in-law', 'relationship', 'natural', 'are', 'questions', 'want', 'answered', 'such', 'why', 'George', 'left', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'returned', 'least', 'three', 'years', 'not', 'having', 'answer', 'film', 'more', 'believable', 'feel', ""'re"", 'right', 'home', 'center', 'film.I', 'remember', 'Oscar', 'time', 'critics', 'believing', 'JUNEBUG', 'was', 'wrongfully', 'overlooked', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'theatres', 'have', 'viewed', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'agree', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Ashley', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'Ashley', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'overbearing', 'Adams', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'buy', 'feel', 'love', 'surprise', 'was', 'Benjamin', 'McKenzie', 'Prior', 'JUNEBUG', 'only', 'associated', 'television', 'OC', 'film', 'see', 'young', 'star', 'talent', 'actually', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'more', 'five', 'minutes', 'THE', 'OC', 'suppose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'great', 'moment', 'small', 'scene', 'church', 'supper', 'George', 'up', 'sings', 'hymn', 'Softly', 'Tenderly', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'lip-synched', 'Novola', 'doing', 'own', 'vocals', 'great', 'treat', 'enjoyable', 'film']",Junebug

Places can attach so deeply to a person that a person who would be far more successful in life living in a different environment never achieves that success because they have become so attached to a place.  On the other time some places disturb people so much that they are able to pull away from the attachments and leave.  The power of place is augmented by the different people who live in places.  Family, friends, business associates, even casual acquaintances are sometimes more attached or detached from a particular place than we are.  Our relationships with those people affect how we view and live in the places that we do.  This might seem very straight-forward and simple, but it actually something that is very deep and complex so much so that most people chose to ignore it than rather think about it because if one were to actually think about it, that person would have to examine his or her life and most people don't like to do that.  The filmmakers of JUNEBUG decided to examine this aspect of life and in doing so have created a very deep and thoughtful film about the impact of place, and in turn the people from those places, in our lives.George (Allesandro Nivola) is a suave and cultivated man who was raised in the country but has moved to and adjusted quite well to city life.  George meets a beautiful and slightly older Chicago art gallery owner Madeline (Embeth Davidtz) at a showing.  The two fall madly in love and are married to each other within a week.  Madeline's gallery specializes in ""outsider"" artists--unknowns who create powerful and provocative works.  She takes a fancy to the art created by a southern gentleman and when learning where he lives sets out to sign him to her gallery.  Her trip south serves two purposes, though because George's family only live about thirty miles away from the artist and George and Madeline will be staying with them while in the area.  After all, George really is a country boy and it's high time his wife met the family.  During the course of their stay Madeline struggles with trying to be accepted by George's family, whom see her as an outsider, and signing the artist to her gallery.  It is a collision of worlds: English vs. American, city vs. country, complex vs. simple. George has his own struggles, to as he attempts to bridge his past and upbringing with the lifestyle he is now leading.  He has some assistance from his very pregnant sister-in-law Ashley (Amy Adams) who adores Madeline and the life she lives.  Ashley loves her husband, but they've had some tough times and she hopes that the arrival of their baby (who she wants to nickname Junebug) will help bring some peace.Ashley is supposed to be a secondary character in the film, but she is really the center of the story.  Much of this is due to the performance of Amy Adams.  Everyone does an excellent job in their various roles, but it is Adams who truly shines.  She steals every scene that she is in and her portrayal of Ashley is touching and at times heartrending.  It is an Oscar-worthy performance and I look forward to seeing everything Ms. Adams does in the future.Not everyone will enjoy watching JUNEBUG.  In fact, the first time I saw the movie I didn't like it very much.  It had been highly recommended to me by a good friend whose taste in movies is almost impeccable.  However, after having seen the movie again recently, I was overcome by the film's simple charms.  It deals with some rather complex issues that parallel the cultural schism that seems to exist in our country.  At the same time it is a wonderful little film that celebrates the beauty, wonder, and simplicity of life.",5,Roots Versus Wings,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,3808,"['choose', 'admit', 'not', 'places', 'are', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'helping', 'create', 'type', 'people', 'are', 'type', 'people', 'become', 'Places', 'can', 'attach', 'so', 'deeply', 'person', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'life', 'living', 'different', 'environment', 'never', 'success', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'attached', 'place', 'other', 'time', 'places', 'disturb', 'people', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'able', 'pull', 'away', 'attachments', 'leave', 'power', 'place', 'augmented', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'places', 'Family', 'friends', 'business', 'associates', 'even', 'casual', 'acquaintances', 'are', 'sometimes', 'more', 'attached', 'detached', 'particular', 'place', 'are', 'relationships', 'people', 'affect', 'how', 'view', 'live', 'places', 'do', 'might', 'seem', 'very', 'straight-forward', 'simple', 'actually', 'something', 'very', 'deep', 'complex', 'so', 'much', 'most', 'people', 'chose', 'ignore', 'rather', 'think', 'one', 'were', 'actually', 'think', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'examine', 'life', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', 'filmmakers', 'JUNEBUG', 'decided', 'examine', 'aspect', 'life', 'doing', 'so', 'have', 'created', 'very', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'impact', 'place', 'turn', 'people', 'places', 'lives.George', 'Allesandro', 'Nivola', 'suave', 'cultivated', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'country', 'moved', 'adjusted', 'quite', 'well', 'city', 'life', 'George', 'beautiful', 'slightly', 'older', 'Chicago', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'Madeline', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'showing', 'two', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'are', 'married', 'other', 'week', 'Madeline', 'gallery', 'outsider', 'artists', 'unknowns', 'who', 'create', 'powerful', 'provocative', 'works', 'fancy', 'art', 'created', 'southern', 'gentleman', 'when', 'learning', 'where', 'out', 'sign', 'gallery', 'trip', 'south', 'serves', 'two', 'purposes', 'though', 'George', 'family', 'only', 'live', 'thirty', 'miles', 'away', 'artist', 'George', 'Madeline', 'will', 'be', 'staying', 'area', 'George', 'really', 'country', 'boy', 'high', 'time', 'wife', 'met', 'family', 'course', 'stay', 'Madeline', 'trying', 'be', 'accepted', 'George', 'family', 'whom', 'see', 'outsider', 'signing', 'artist', 'gallery', 'collision', 'worlds', 'English', 'vs.', 'American', 'city', 'vs.', 'country', 'complex', 'vs.', 'simple', 'George', 'own', 'struggles', 'bridge', 'past', 'upbringing', 'lifestyle', 'now', 'leading', 'assistance', 'very', 'pregnant', 'sister-in-law', 'Ashley', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'Madeline', 'life', 'Ashley', 'husband', ""'ve"", 'had', 'tough', 'times', 'arrival', 'baby', 'who', 'nickname', 'Junebug', 'will', 'help', 'bring', 'peace.Ashley', 'supposed', 'be', 'secondary', 'character', 'film', 'really', 'center', 'story', 'Much', 'due', 'performance', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Everyone', 'excellent', 'job', 'various', 'roles', 'Adams', 'who', 'truly', 'shines', 'scene', 'portrayal', 'Ashley', 'touching', 'times', 'heartrending', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'everything', 'Ms.', 'Adams', 'future.Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'JUNEBUG', 'fact', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'had', 'been', 'highly', 'recommended', 'good', 'friend', 'taste', 'movies', 'almost', 'impeccable', 'However', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'again', 'recently', 'was', 'overcome', 'film', 'simple', 'charms', 'rather', 'complex', 'issues', 'parallel', 'cultural', 'schism', 'exist', 'country', 'same', 'time', 'wonderful', 'little', 'film', 'beauty', 'wonder', 'simplicity', 'life']",Junebug

953463,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000BYRCQU,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[0, 7]","Junebug is a very unique film on family tides and lifestyle clashes. The characters are all very well rendered by strong actings, which is the best thing about this film. Madeleine(Emberth Davidtz) is a sophisticated Chicago-based art dealer, and she's married to George(Alessandro Nivola) whose family still live in North Carolina. They took a roadtrip down south to visit a local artist and stayed with  George's family while they were in town. At first Madeleine found it hard to get along with the family, because they are so different in many ways.George's mother(Celia Weston very convincing as a conservative southern housewife) is not fond of Madeleine, while his father(Scott Wilson) is quite and withdrawn. Madeleine had a hard time even socializing with her Brother-in-law Johnny(fen McKenzie) who was a total nut-case and easily lashes out when there is a disagreement. The only person in the family that she could establish a strong connection to was Johnny's wife Ashley(Amy Adams), who was heavily pregnant. Ashley has to face constant verbal abuse from Johnny and she's so emotionally insecure. The constant bad temper played out by Johnny was just a bit irritating to watch sometimes.While this might be one of the year's best indie films, it's weakness lies on the script and editing. The cast is just so captivating altogher. Especially Amy Adams who stole the show with a very goofy and vulnerable performance. The hospital scene when she had a miscarriage was so powerful, and she just moved me to tears!
