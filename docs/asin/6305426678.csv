In fact, I felt as if my chances of spontaneously combusting while winning a hand of blackjack on an online casino were better.  A friend of mine, however, suggested it.  One must bear in mind that I am normally not that vulnerable to the power of suggestion, but this was a very hot girl and hot girls generally don't talk to me.  So I call the video store:  ""Hi, do you have 'She's All That?'"" I asked.  ""Uh, yes,"" they replied while dialing 911 on the other line.  Let me tell you, you have not died a slow death until you go to a video store and say ""Hi, I'm the guy who called about 'She's All That.'""Now granted, the make-over tale is a fairly trite and cliched storyline.  For some reason, however, ""She's All That"" isn't as bad as some would think.  Why you ask?  Rachel Leigh Cook is really, really hot.  So hot that even the director's clever attempt to make her ugly (a pair of glasses) didn't work.  Now, I wear glasses.  What are they trying to say here?

I was writing a lot of Illyria stories from Angel (they'll also go with my wicked cool Halloween costume that I just planned, I always plan this holiday early...and I got a little behind) I had watched this with my friends at the beginning of the month, (I hadn't seen it in forever and I forgot how fun it was. 1st off I want to g e t to the spoof from Not Another Teen movie, because for the most part that was the best part(and if you've wondering; no I do not mean the American Pie connection with it; I didn't really care for that) No the 1st thing I mean is her movie names are funny, Janie Briggs is the spoof name, and Laney Boggs is the one in the Real movie...okay that's weird.....so I just switched the names around. I also think it's funny when they describe her, oh not Laney Boggs (remember I switch the names around!) She's got glasses and a ponytail, and she's got paint on her over_all's come on! Me and my friends all thought that was really funny! Okay enough with the spoof, here's the Real movie...1st and even if this sounds cliche' I was the Weird Chick in my school. I love (and still do) monsters, and bad (and good scary movies (Vampire ones like Lost Boys)  and Bad Boys like my husband and Corey Feldman when other girls were into...well whatever popular girls were into during Our Grunge Era, Personally I didn't really care, cause I don't like those kind of people..I like what I like and I like hanging out with the outcast crowd cause were all about being ourselves. That's one of the main reasons I like this movie so much. Because it also shows that you can be true to yourself. The funny thing is I actually do like the main popular chick (but she reminds me of Cordelia on Buffy) The only time I don't is when she's mean to Janie (again name switch) Cause Oh! You're having a bad night so you're gonna take it out on her when she's having fun? (That's why I like Cordelia who is a nice person turns out, but not Popular people) and my guy likes to cheer me up if I'm having a bad day by reminding me of something fun we did...like a fun memory or a song that cheers you up and says Remember We or you were having fun, try it...it works) and I like the dance scene, even though it's heavily choreographed (surprisingly I like dances, but not all in a Carrie way like you'd think, cause lately in some other stories I wrote some Casablanca like Dance scenes with the song Dream a little dream in it (I love that song it reminds me of Happy Summers I had.) I didn't care much for that guy who gets The Foghorn alarm, which was pretty great by the way...but I did think it was also pretty funny how close that scene was to the one with the Green Goblins son from Spider Man with Toby McGuire in the 1st movie.

463782,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6305426678,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 3]","1.  Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character, Zach Siler, was likable, but was he believable? He was a jock, but he was a nice guy. Yeah, right. His big dilemma was whether he should go to Dartmouth or Harvard. And we care and feel sympathy because???  Also, he was the BMOC, but why? Because he was class president and the captain of the soccer team? Who cares about soccer? This is America, and football rules. And not the football that sissy Europeans mean when they say football.2.  Rachael Leigh Cook was so short; she really looked like she belonged in kindergarten. Rachael Leigh Cook? Try Rachael ""Short Order"" Cook. Her character's name, Laney Boggs, was a nod to Wynona Ryder as Lelaina ""Laney"" Pierce in Reality Bites and Kim Boggs in Edward Scissorhands. I knew Wynona Ryder when she shoplifted in a store I worked at, and Rachael Leigh Cook is no Wynona Ryder. Also, she didn't make a convincing artist, or even a convincing art student. The script didn't take her art seriously, and why should we? Her performance art was a string of hackneyed clich&eacute;s. I mean, come on. Midgets writhing under a sheet? Been there, done that.-----------------------Zach Siler: What was that?Laney Boggs: I was busy.Zach Siler: Yeah, busy wiggin'.Laney Boggs: I did not wig.Zach Siler: Oh, there was major wiggage.=======================================3.  Matthew Lillard was Reality TV 'star' Brock Hudson. What kind of name is Brock Hudson? If the whole Reality TV shtick wasn't so done, over, and overdone, it MIGHT have been an effective parody. I like that Rick James song, ""Give It To Me, Baby"" and it didn't deserve the treatment it got from Brock Hudson's choreography.4.  Paul Walker was Zach's rival, Dean Sampson. He was much better as Lance Harbor in Varsity Blues, made the same year as SAT (She's All That). Varsity Blues was funnier, and also more dramatic. Varsity Blues was what SAT wishes it could have been.------------Dean Sampson: His dad owns Harrison Ford.Laney Boggs: The actor?Dean Sampson: No, the car dealership.======================5.  Jodi Lyn O'Keefe as Prom Queen Taylor Vaughan was just so lame. I REALLY didn't care. She was supposed to be such a major diva, but she was a major drag. It would have been slightly better if Laney Boggs had stood up to her when she poured her drink down Laney's insubstantial d&eacute;colletage. A perfectly good cat fight opportunity tossed away. At least Zach should have done SOMETHING. While playing Nash Bridges' daughter, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe was rumored to be involved with Don's Johnson.6.  Anna Paquin was Mackenzie Siler, Zach's sister. What a waste of an Oscar winner. What few good lines there were, were mostly Pacquin's, but that's not saying much.----------------Mackenzie Siler: When was the last time you tweezed?Laney Boggs: What?Mackenzie Siler: I mean your eyebrows.Laney Boggs: Never, why?Mackenzie Siler: Ever watch Sesame Street?Laney Boggs: Yeah.Mackenzie Siler: You know Bert?============================7.  Kieran Culkin as Simon Boggs was another waste of resources. At least Zach stood up to Simon's bullies--which kind of made me question his priorities when he did absolutely nothing when Laney was being bullied by Taylor. Kieran Culkin excelled as Buster in The Cider House Rules. I wonder if Kieran was any good in Igby Goes Down?8.  Gabrielle Union was Katie, and she was also Chastity in 10 Things I Hate About You. In both movies, she played a friend or sidekick, and would have been much more interesting to focus on than the ostensible main characters. Is it because she's black? With Dul&eacute; Hill as Preston, I wonder the same thing. He played a complex character on The West Wing very well, but isn't given much to do in SAT.9.  Elden Henson as Jesse Jackson was the chubby friend of Laney, always supportive, always there for her. In a very minor subplot, he may have hooked up with Zach's sister Mackenzie at the prom. This character should have been gay. That would have been more realistic, by far. Compare him to the character who was Lindsay Lohan's friend in Mean Girls, and it is no contest. What's up with that name, Jesse Jackson? Is that supposed to be funny? Less funny, even, than Brock Hudson.10.  Usher Raymond was the Campus D.J. and Kimberly 'Lil' Kim' Jones was Alex, and they represent yet more missed opportunities for SAT. I didn't even recognize 'Lil' Kim' but then again I am unfamiliar with her oeuvre, but I've heard of her because of her Martha Stewart situation. And I don't mean that she fashioned pine cones and discarded bottle caps into decorative placemats, I mean that she did time in the slammer. In 2005, Lil' Kim served a yearlong prison sentence for lying to a jury about her friends' involvement in a shooting four years earlier. Let me just say one last thing, that along with the jabs at Reality TV, the rap and hip hop elements that they injected into SAT have a very short shelf life, and only make SAT seem all the more outdated in retrospect.For all the musical talent onscreen, the only soundtrack numbers that clicked for me were ""Kiss Me"" by Sixpence None the Richer, and the dance at the prom sequence set to ""The Rockafeller Skank"" by Fatboy Slim. The latter was only thrown in at the last minute to pad the running time, which came up short.Nancy Drew(2007) .... Rachael Leigh Cook was Jane BrightonScooby-Doo - The Movie [HD DVD] (2002) ....

Like,Cluelesstransplants Jane Austen's Emma to Beverly Hills. Like,10 Things I Hate About Youwas inspired by Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. She's All That is a modern take on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, as well as a teen twist on Pretty Woman. These movies support that notion that no one really has an original story anymore. But at least you can dust off that old chestnut and present it in ways that are witty and interesting. Sometimes, it really just boils down to presentation.Spring break done, and Zach Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and his fellow students are looking forward to the remaining six weeks of schooling at Harrison High. Zach is rich and good-looking, is the class president, captain of the soccer team, most popular guy in school. He loses a bit of shine when his smoking hot girlfriend, the stunning but oh-so-hateful Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), breaks up with him on account of her having hooked up with a reality television star while spring breaking in Daytona Beach.Zach's feelings are stung, and this makes him vulnerable to his buddy's taunting. In one of those wagers in which you just know someone's gonna get hurt, Zach posits that he can take any girl in school and, in six weeks' time, make her prom queen. But he balks at the girl his pal finally picks out: Laney Boggs.Laney (Rachel Leigh Cook) is mousy and sullen and unapproachable. She's a brooding artist whose art suffers because of her inability to open up. Sinking her even more in school clique status is that her dad (Kevin Pollak) is the neighborhood pool man. When Zach approaches her at the falafel fast food joint where she works (site of one of the film's funniest scenes), Laney assumes that he requires tutoring lessons, never mind that Zach has the school's fourth highest G.P.A. But our boy's nothing but persistent and she finally caves and agrees to hang out. They rendezvous at a performance art theater where we see Lanie on stage capering around with weird make-up caked on her face. And when she challenges Zach to go improv on stage and he does this telling bit with a hacky sack, that moment is when I got clued in that there's more to the guy than his big-jock-on-campus creds and living under the shadow of a demanding father.The best thing about this movie is that it's not willing to settle for rolling out a by-the-numbers narrative. It's smart and has heart and is exuberant and is so much fun. The prom queen election and even Laney and Zach's relationship serve as a platform to observe the differences in class and social life style. It doesn't hurt that the exploration leads to many very funny moments and plenty of snappy zingers. Prinze Jr. and Cook have incredible chemistry, but I also appreciate the presence of Kevin Pollak who is warm and steady as Laney's father and hilarious in an unobstrusive way. One of the film's showcase scenes involves him at home absent-mindedly hurling wrong answers at Jeopardy even as the JV soccer team does housekeeping around him. He finally looks up and says: ""Who are you people?"" She's All That was an unexpected surprise when it came out in 1999. It features a grip of supporting actors that are very recognizable today (Paul Walker, Anna Paquin, Usher, Matthew Lillard, etc.).

However, in typical fashion, the unpopular person ends up being the bigger person, and eventually teaching one of the cruel, selfish popular people something about life.The biggest problem with this movie is that Rachael Leigh Cook is the nerd and Freddie Prinze Jr. is the agent for change.  I can buy Prinze as the big man on campus, but Cook as the unpopular, awkward, artsy student?  Maybe the latter two are believeable, but there is no world in which Cook is the unpopular girl in school while looking like she does.

Enter the lovely face and legs of americans 1999 sex pot Racheal Leigh Cook who falls for freedy ( which girl wouldnt) but then finds out that he was using her to win a bet.A great story about the fact that if your a ugly girl and a hot guy like freedy prince asks you to a dance he prolly is doing it for a bet to win money or an Augie Ojeda jersey or he is suffering from amniesia and thinks your Hilary Duff.Great cmaeo by the guy who wwas in Scooby, summer catch and Scream you may remember in Scream he says ""Stand back, this one a really sceamer.""I obtanined 9wink-wink)a used copy of this movie back in 2000 but i gave it to my friend cuz i thought he would watch it w/ his sister who I was crushing over at the time.

Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[17, 22]","Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr) is doing fine - he's just started his last 8 weeks of high school, he's class president, he's dating the most desirable girl in high school, and they are a shoo-in for prom king and queen. Everything's good until his girlfriend arrives at school. Taylor Vaughn (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) got a tattoo on spring break, and she is now dating Brock Hudson (Matthew Lillard), whose only claim to fame is that he's an idiot on MTV's Real World reality TV. Zack is hurt, especially when his friend Dean (Paul Walker) razzes him about it. Zack responds by claiming he can make any girl in school into the prom queen. That's the kind of statement that leads to a bet. Dean says he'll choose a girl for Zack's challenge, and he chooses Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook).Laney is about as big an outsider as Taylor's ego. She's an artist - she has been advised that many artists are more appreciated after they are dead, so she should kill herself (we all need ""friends"" like that, right?). She looks after her father and her brother. She's clumsy. She wears unattractive glasses. She wears no makeup. She wears overalls. She even wears a daggy hat while she works in a fast-food joint. They've pulled out all the stops to try to make the beautiful Rachael Leigh Cook look plain (they failed, but they tried hard!).This is the predictable My Fair Lady type of story, or so it seems at first, especially when Zack's sister Mackenzie (Anna Paquin) gets involved to do a make-over on Laney. But there are some nice little twists, and they add up to a film that's different enough to be a pleasant time. Two of the interviewees mention that this film was deliberately modelled on early John Hughes films; I'm not sure I'd agree with that, but it does capture the idea of the romantic comedy / teen comedy genre to which this film belongs.There are some interesting lesser characters in this film. We get to see Gabrielle Union and Clea DuVall as minor characters, and Sarah Michelle Gellar in a non-speaking role (she's included in a list headed ""They're all that"" in the end-credits).

Usually, I do not take teen romantic comedies too seriously; the characters are not mature enough to make me actually believe that their romance will end up with a wedding. The mature viewer watches this kind of flicks with one idea in mind: ""Yeah, right... these two guys are just going through a chemical and purely emotional reaction, have no clue whatsoever of the kinds of commitments that a true relationship requires, and finally... their relationship will not survive the four years of college...""So, why am I writing a review on this one? Basically, one reason: I liked the character of Laney Boggs; she was really sweet and feminine, a characteristic that is kind of latent in today's women.There is one scene that I would watch over and over in this movie: the scene when she walks down the stairs after her amazing makeover. No only is she gorgeus (that goes without saying), but the whole scene is the epitome of femininity.

She brings such honestly and virtue to all her characters and while being beautiful she's not the kind of beautiful where she looks unapprochable, she looks like she would be a normal down-to-earth person that could of easily went to your school. I think she's absolutly adorable. I love her little girl face.Like I said she plays Laney, a high school senior who is the ""geek"" of her high school she's known as the ugly duckling. It's obvious that the people who did this movie realized it's impossible to make it a total transformation like in The Princess Diaries cause Rachel can't go from downright ugly and sad to stunningly beautiful like others can because she's naturaly beautiful and her beauty doesn't come from makeup a fancy hairdo or a skimpy outfit. But they made an effort to give her plain nothing special long hair, big glasses and a clumsy nature to make her an ugly duckling. But Cook took what she had to work with and slamdunked it.Freddie Prinze Jr. plays oppisite of Rachel as Zach the most popular guy in school who seemed like he had everything going for him. Cute, popular, smart, dating the hottest girl in school who is up for prom queen, a jock, your typical popular guy. But when his girlfriend Taylor  (played by the beautiful and talented Jodi Lyn O'Keefe who often gets the sexy and popular but downright bit**y roles thrown at her. But she's still one of my favorites) comes back from spring break, she also comes back with a new tattoo and a new famous boy toy (played by the always goofy Matthew Lillard) so she drops Zach like a hot burrito which is a major burn to his ego and reputation.Zach's best friend (played by sexy Paul Walker from the fast and the furious movies) offers him a bet. He gets to pick a girl for Zach to date and transform into prom queen material in only a few weeks and whoever loses has to go to graduation naked. Zach agrees, and guess who he picks. You guessed it, Laney. At first Laney is totally turned off by Zach's sudden interest but slowly starts to hang out with him and as she does Zach's little sister gets rid of the glasses cuts her hair and gives her makeup and a little red dress and suddenly Laney is known as Taylor's competition for prom queen and Zach becomes smitten for real.Laney has to deal with Taylor who when her new boy toy kicks her to the curb suddenly wants to pick Zach back up but of course he's not interested anymore cause he likes Laney and this makes Taylor jealous at Laney. She also has to deal with Zach's friend who arranged the bet and picked Laney thinking he was sure to win the bet but now feels threatened and so decides to try to get Laney for himself and make Zach look like a jerk to her.The attraction between Laney and Zach is undeniable and when he starts hanging around her she inspires him to be a nice guy and to look at where his future is headed.The whole cast is great and it's a lot better protrayal for teens and more believeable then other teen movies are.

463832,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305426678,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","To me, this is an exceptionally lightweight and predictable romantic comedy. Still, it has some things going for it. The production values are good, and the photography is, at times, imaginative. It has some of the better new stars, particularly Freddie Prinz, Jr. and Matthew Lillard. While the script shows no new insights into teen life, it also does not belittle its characters, as has been the case in many recent movies. It even has a parent who is a good role model. These elements add up to making it a very likable picture.The plot is elementary. Zach [Prinz] is the affable President of his Senior class. When he is dumped by his self-centered beauty queen of a girlfriend, he is left without a date for the prom. His pride wounded, he boasts to a couple of friends that he could make any girl a prom queen. They make a bet with him. The girl they choose for him is Laney [Rachael Lee Cook], who, of course, wears glasses, trips a lot and prefers a bohemian lifestyle. This plot is so old, I can't think of when it was invented. Maybe Charlotte Bronte thought it up back in 1850!Freddie Prinz, Jr. has become a pro at playing the likable high school hero who doubts the validity of his place in the world. It will be interesting to watch his transition into more adult roles in the next few years. My prediction is that he will follow Keanu Reeves into the action/adventure area. Matthew Lillard is one of our funniest young actors. Here is plays Brock, the somewhat older guy who stole Zach's girlfriend. Brock has had his fifteen minutes of fame by appearing on MTV's Real Life. He's so obnoxious that he got kicked off the show. [If you've ever seen Real Like, you know that's an almost impossible feat.] As Laney, Rachael Lee Cook is only so-so. This is not entirely her fault. Eye glasses and kooky clothes are not enough to mask the fact she's a very pretty girl. This makes her transformation from ugly duckling to swan a bit silly.She's All That does a fairly good job of pointing out that social events like Senior prom are not the life-altering moments that are cracked up to be. It does so gently, however, as if the makers were too timid to make much of a statement. I think today's teenagers are exceptionally bright, or at least a lot smarter than movie makers give them credit for.I do think that the days of meaningful movies about young love are gone for good. This is due to society's change in attitude regarding the age at which one is considered to be all grown up. That threshold used to be about seventeen or eighteen years old. Today, this seems to have been pushed to the far side of thirty. As a result, love among people still in high school is almost always looked upon something which is fleeting and unimportant, although kids would surely not agree with me. If I am right, then movies about teenage life seem doomed to be confined to a very limiting space. They will only be able to regurgitate the same stories and characters over and over again, at the rate of about fifty pictures a year. So let's be frank. Romeo and Juliet are dead.

They single out Laney, and the chase is on.A few things put me off about this movie.  Firstly, this wasn't a new story (it's Pygmalion / My Fair Lady, like I said).  Secondly, it is possible that people really are mindless sheep enough to go along with something once a person in power says to do it, as eventually Laney will not be tarred and feathered once Zach starts bringing her to parties out of her area.  Third, if Zach really was such a nice guy (which he seems to be), I have a hard time believing that someone like him would be with a shrew like Taylor to begin with.  Looking back, I realize that a lot of the popular kids got their ways with people by making them look bad before others (like when Taylor pours her drink down Laney's dress), and Zach seems too good to do something like that to someone.  And fourth, Laney was hot underneith all those ugly clothes and hostile attitude, you could tell through those overalls and thick glasses.  Naturally if and when she got dolled up, she would be all she could be rather than look like an ogre in a dress.It's nice, light entertainment.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[2, 3]","It's such a shame that the same old ideas can be churned out on the back of attractive stars and that people actually buy it.  This well-groomed adaptation of the 'Pygmalion' story has high school jock Zach being dumped by his popular girlfriend.  Without a date for the prom he accepts a bet from a friend to transform geeky art student Laney into the future prom queen.Of course we wall know the drill - initial loathing turns to love and as soon as Laney takes off her glasses we all realise how incredibly beautiful she is.  As Zach, Freddie Prinze Jr. shows off his vacuous acting ability and grins a lot.  Rachael Leigh Cook fares better as wide-eyed Laney but it's amazing that the brilliant Anna Paquin and Matthew Lillard were sidelined to make way for such leads.This may be gorgeous to look at but it's neither interesting nor fun seen as the audience already knows what's going to happen, hence why there's no tension when Laney discovers that she was just a bet.  There are also far too many plot holes, which even a casual viewer will easily spot.  For instance, why does Laney state that she cannot wear contacts but for her magical transformation halfway through the movie has got rid of the irksome things.  The only point of recommendation is a very good dance scene indeed towards the end, but that's hardly enough of a reason to watch a movie is it.  At least Anna Paquin and Matthew Lillard are there, plus a brief cameo from 'Buffy' star Sarah Michelle Gellar.  Eagle-eyed viewers may notice that the movie uses the same high school as in the hit TV show.The bottom line is that this is boring, and that there are not only a hundred other teen movies like it but a hundred other teen movies that are better than it.

After his hot-shot girlfriend, Taylor, dumps him for a TV star, he makes a bet with his best friend, Dean. Dean bets him that he cannot find a Taylor-replacement by the time their Senior Prom rolls around and be able to turn her into the Prom Queen! Zack, not wanting to be a coward, accepts the challenge and Dean ends up setting Zack up with the biggest geek in school: Laney Boggs!

463848,A2WZYL0HNUR5XH,6305426678,Robert Shuler,"[1, 2]","The cover says it all.  This is a romantic comedy, a relationship movie about two people.  If that's what you are in the market for viewing, you will not be disappointed by the stereotyped portrayal of other characters or annoyed by the cheesy rendering of high school life.  These are only plot devices.  But because of them I witheld one (only one) star.Several reviewers note Rachael Leigh Cook's striking talent and charm; I concur.  There are few other movies that are written to showcase her as well as this one, but I am hoping some will be made.  A few rebuttals are in order to some other comments.  There is no skin in the movie, and only one curse word (appropriately uttered).  And it will not undermine your preferred sexual orientation.The plot is a combination of Cinderella and the equally common idea that a social manipulator falls for his own tricks (Cupid pricking himself with his own arrow in Cupid & Psyche).  For all the comic intent, the resolution is surprisingly down to earth and satisfying.  The very last scene likely would be forbidden in the real world, but it's funny and confirms the characters.  Only one aspect of character motivation bothered me.  If Zach is so insightful about people and relationships, what was he doing hanging around Taylor in the first place?  And where does he get his insight?  Not from his father.  I guess it would make the movie too long and too serious to explain this, so just suspend disbelief.  Laney's character, by comparison, is fully motivated and explained.There is a music video among the extras which is a gem!  ""Kiss Me"" performed by Sixpence (from their self-titled CD).  They are sitting on a bench jammin' and the way the lead singer flirts with the camera, interposed with scenes from the movie and fantasy takeoffs from the movie, interacting with words from the song, unifies the movie with unrevealed childhood.  It is a welcome relief from pointless trendy scene-frenzy which is so common.  Unfortunately, the rest of Sixpence's music is not so upbeat.

Throughout the whole movie. Now, I do understand that this is a fictional movie and therefore it is set in a fictional world, where anything is possible (except Laney Boggs becoming Prom Queen of course), but I felt like this movie was so far out into la la land with it's premise and execution that it was hard to really relate or like any of the characters in the movie. First of all, why do movies always have to over-exagerate the bitchiness of a Prom Queen??? In my school, the Homecoming Court and Prom Court were chock full of nice, friendly kids, and the ones who took home the crowns were voted on because of there personalities, not because they were HOT like Taylor Vaugh or whatever her name was. I hate that stereotype because it doesn't relate to any school-at least any school in the midwest! Also, What was so terribly heinous about Rachel Lee Cook that they would pick her over ANY other girl in the school-So what if she wore ugly clothes and had big glasses-the girl has a killer face and a tiny little body...her only flaw was her love for being a loner. Freddy Prinze Jr. was at his peak in this movie though-he seems to have gone WAYYYYYYY downhill since this movie was released. The best part about this movie is the cheesy makeover sequence when Laney walks down the stairs to Sixpence None The Richer's song KISS ME. The BIGGEST let down of this movie to me though was that Taylor won Prom Queen over Laney. Seriously, that still pisses me off to this day. The ending was just a complete and utter bomb...I wanted that skank Taylor to lose and cry or get totally laughed at or at least have had SOME minor bad thing happen to her. She was just a horrible, snotty witch and nothing bad seemed to happen to her.

It's one of those kinds of films where someone is put to the challenge of turning the ugly duckling into a stunning beauty.  A popular guy of the school takes on a bet that it can be done, and so Rachel Leigh Cook is the subject of transition.  For being a guy in my forties, I can still feel a little of a flashback of my high school days since this film continued to be charming in it's portrayal of modern day high school kids, which some movies (like ""American Pie"" ishh!) chose to entertain the warped teen (problems at home type) psyche that does not interest us all.And, why any guy could be attracted to, or how any of the other girls of the school could be aspired to, want to be just like that girl Taylor, a self-absorbed, foul mouthed, everyday mattress-back skank. That I will never know.  I guess it's good casting to have that less than appealing blonde witch play the foe competing for the prom queen crown.I am pleased too, that they have just released Drew Barrymore's ""Never Been Kissed"" on to Blu-Ray as well.  These two make for a great double feature on Blu-Ray for me and my wife this weekend.  For a triple feature, I could just add ""Mean Girls"".  And if you like the ""turn to ugly duckling into a beauty queen"" type of movie, check out ""Americanizing Shelley.""

At least one  reviewer from Michigan seemed to have some sort of feminist agenda  in her negative remarks about this picture.  My advice is that you watch  without your agenda filter on.  If you do that, you'll find this to be one  of the better teenage romantic comedies to come around in a while.  In my  opinion, it's better than &quot;Ten Things I Hate About You&quot;, a  teenage Taming of the Shrew which I also liked.Having said that  &quot;She's All That&quot; is a good motion picture and worthy of your  time, I must warn you that you'd be better off seeing it on VHS than DVD.

463857,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,6305426678,S. Schell,"[2, 3]","Let's get one thing straight before I make my critique: for those who are expecting an earnest depiction of high school students and high school life, look elsewhere.  ""She's All That"" is as over-the-top as it can get and the movie ironically contains random jokes and parodies about supposedly realistic programs as well, namely the MTV-spawned reality show ""The Real World"" and its progeny series ""Road Rules"".  This movie is all in good fun but it does manage to hint at a good deal of real life trifles that particular people suffer in that highly-influential and barely survivable place that we geeks and outsiders call ""high school"".  Well, maybe not ""high school"" (probably closer to HELL), but anyone who was picked on or unjustifiably ostracized gets the picture.The endearing Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze, Jr. star in this sugary ditty about a dude named Zack Silar (Prinze) who is ditched by his long-time armpiece Taylor Vaughn (O'Keefe) only six weeks before the prom.  He suffers public humiliation in front of his jock companions and, moreover, the entire school.  His less-than-sympathetic pal Dean (Walker) proposes a bet which the illustrious school president can't pass up: Dean will hand-pick the geekiest girl in the school and within the time allotted, Zack must transform her into a mega-babe and make her more than eligible for the elite status of prom queen.  The deal is on and within only two minutes of searching, the ""scary and inaccessible"" Laney Boggs (Cook) makes her appearance by falling flat on her face in the courtyard - Dean has found his guinea pig.  From here, Prinze and Cook do the traditional and recycled theme of geek-to-goddess. Suspension of disbelief is a pre-requisite for this transformation - the pretty and petite Cook is hardly an ugly duckling by any standard, her luminous brown eyes and almost pixie-ish beauty a complete distraction, even when she is supposed to look mousy (tortoiseshell glasses, stringy hair, sloppy clothes, etc.).  Prinze comes off humble and sweet even when he is trying to be suave and arrogant, but this doesn't ruin anything.  We rather want to see him that way because we want to believe that he really does care about Laney and that his reputation is the last thing on his mind.  Prinze does this remarkably well.  Matthew Lillard of ""Scream"" fame is a riot as a fictitious Real World cast member Brock Landers, a character that is obviously modeled from the obnoxious and insensitive Puck from Real World San Francisco.  Of course, he's a lot more likeable because his character is a complete farce and Lillard almost steals the show.  Almost unbearable is Paul Walker as Dean Sampson, the narcissistic jock who places the bet with Zack and manipulates it in his favor.  Walker's delivery is so forced and obtuse that one would believe that is truly HIS nature and not just his character.  Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is a comedic queen as the vacuous Taylor Vaughn, and Kieran Culkin and Eldin Ratliff are again part of the same cast list (The Mighty) but this time as Laney's younger brother Simon and her best friend Jesse, respectively.  If you watch closely during a particular lunchroom scene, you will see Prinze's fianc&eacute; and ""Buffy"" TV star Sarah Michelle Gellar make a brief cameo.""She's All That"" borrows a lot of old themes but still remains fresh because of its enthusiastic cast and an above average script.  If teen fluff is your fave, direct yourselves towards cookie-cutter flicks like ""Down To You"", ""Ten Things I Hate About You"",  ""Can't Hardly Wait"" and the all-time classic ""Clueless"".  If you want some BIG laughs, rent ""American Pie"" and watch for its sequel, due out August 10th.  Lastly, if you really want to see Prinze show off his acting gams, rent ""The House of Yes"".",4,Pygmalion '99,996624000,"08 1, 2001",2001,3785,"['Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'make', 'critique', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'earnest', 'depiction', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'as', 'over-the-top', 'can', 'get', 'movie', 'ironically', 'random', 'jokes', 'parodies', 'supposedly', 'realistic', 'programs', 'as', 'well', 'namely', 'MTV-spawned', 'reality', 'show', 'Real', 'World', 'progeny', 'series', 'Road', 'Rules', 'movie', 'all', 'good', 'fun', 'manage', 'hint', 'good', 'deal', 'real', 'life', 'trifles', 'particular', 'people', 'suffer', 'highly-influential', 'barely', 'survivable', 'place', 'geeks', 'outsiders', 'call', 'high', 'school', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'high', 'school', 'probably', 'closer', 'HELL', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'picked', 'unjustifiably', 'ostracized', 'picture.The', 'endearing', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'star', 'sugary', 'ditty', 'dude', 'named', 'Zack', 'Silar', 'Prinze', 'who', 'ditched', 'long-time', 'armpiece', 'Taylor', 'Vaughn', ""O'Keefe"", 'only', 'six', 'weeks', 'prom', 'public', 'humiliation', 'front', 'jock', 'companions', 'moreover', 'entire', 'school', 'less-than-sympathetic', 'pal', 'Dean', 'Walker', 'bet', 'illustrious', 'school', 'president', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'Dean', 'will', 'hand-pick', 'geekiest', 'girl', 'school', 'time', 'allotted', 'Zack', 'must', 'transform', 'mega-babe', 'make', 'more', 'eligible', 'elite', 'status', 'prom', 'queen', 'deal', 'only', 'two', 'minutes', 'searching', 'scary', 'inaccessible', 'Laney', 'Boggs', 'Cook', 'appearance', 'falling', 'flat', 'face', 'courtyard', 'Dean', 'found', 'guinea', 'pig', 'here', 'Prinze', 'Cook', 'do', 'traditional', 'recycled', 'theme', 'geek-to-goddess', 'Suspension', 'disbelief', 'pre-requisite', 'transformation', 'pretty', 'petite', 'Cook', 'hardly', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'standard', 'luminous', 'brown', 'eyes', 'almost', 'pixie-ish', 'beauty', 'complete', 'distraction', 'even', 'when', 'supposed', 'look', 'mousy', 'tortoiseshell', 'glasses', 'stringy', 'hair', 'sloppy', 'clothes', 'etc.', 'Prinze', 'humble', 'sweet', 'even', 'when', 'trying', 'be', 'suave', 'arrogant', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'anything', 'rather', 'want', 'see', 'way', 'want', 'believe', 'really', 'care', 'Laney', 'reputation', 'last', 'thing', 'mind', 'Prinze', 'remarkably', 'well', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Scream', 'fame', 'riot', 'fictitious', 'Real', 'World', 'cast', 'member', 'Brock', 'Landers', 'character', 'obviously', 'modeled', 'obnoxious', 'insensitive', 'Puck', 'Real', 'World', 'San', 'Francisco', 'course', 'lot', 'more', 'likeable', 'character', 'complete', 'farce', 'Lillard', 'almost', 'show', 'Almost', 'unbearable', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Dean', 'Sampson', 'narcissistic', 'jock', 'who', 'bet', 'Zack', 'favor', 'Walker', 'delivery', 'so', 'forced', 'one', 'would', 'believe', 'truly', 'HIS', 'nature', 'not', 'just', 'character', 'Jodi', 'Lyn', ""O'Keefe"", 'comedic', 'queen', 'vacuous', 'Taylor', 'Vaughn', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'Eldin', 'Ratliff', 'are', 'again', 'part', 'same', 'cast', 'list', 'Mighty', 'time', 'Laney', 'younger', 'brother', 'Simon', 'best', 'friend', 'Jesse', 'respectively', 'watch', 'closely', 'particular', 'lunchroom', 'scene', 'will', 'see', 'Prinze', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Buffy', 'TV', 'star', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'make', 'brief', 'cameo', 'lot', 'old', 'themes', 'still', 'fresh', 'enthusiastic', 'cast', 'above', 'average', 'script', 'teen', 'fluff', 'fave', 'direct', 'yourselves', 'cookie-cutter', 'flicks', 'Down', 'Ten', 'Things', 'Hate', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'all-time', 'classic', 'Clueless', 'want', 'BIG', 'laughs', 'rent', 'American', 'Pie', 'watch', 'sequel', 'due', 'out', 'August', '10th', 'Lastly', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Prinze', 'show', 'off', 'acting', 'gams', 'rent', 'House', 'Yes']",N/A

Their motivations are questionable and it stirs up the hot vixen of the school (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). Matthew Lillard, Anna Paquin and Lil Kim are also featured.The cast is great and this is a worthy story about a social outcast coming out of hiding, so to speak. But the potential depth of the plot needed fleshed-out more and the film's just too sentimental for my tastes -- numerous moments where characters share deep feelings, etc. Don't get me wrong, I can get into some share-your-feelings type scenes, but I didn't care enough about the characters here to make it meaningful or engrossing.Still, the message is good and the main cast members are superb. Plus there's no raunch, which is refreshing. Those who enjoy sentimentality will appreciate it more than I did.The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area (Redondo Beach, Malibu, Torrance and Cerritos).GRADE: C+ or B-",3,"Good in many ways, but too mushy",1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1167,"['1999', 'school', 'dramedy/romance', 'flick', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'outcast', 'mousy', 'girl', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'who', 'suddenly', 'couple', 'popular', 'guys', 'interested', 'taking', 'prom', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'motivations', 'are', 'questionable', 'up', 'hot', 'vixen', 'school', 'Jodi', 'Lyn', ""O'Keefe"", 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Lil', 'Kim', 'are', 'also', 'featured.The', 'cast', 'great', 'worthy', 'story', 'social', 'outcast', 'coming', 'hiding', 'so', 'speak', 'potential', 'depth', 'plot', 'needed', 'fleshed-out', 'more', 'film', 'just', 'too', 'sentimental', 'tastes', 'numerous', 'moments', 'where', 'characters', 'share', 'deep', 'feelings', 'etc', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'can', 'get', 'share-your-feelings', 'type', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'characters', 'here', 'make', 'meaningful', 'engrossing.Still', 'message', 'good', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'superb', 'raunch', 'refreshing', 'who', 'enjoy', 'sentimentality', 'will', 'appreciate', 'more', 'did.The', 'film', 'runs', '95', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'greater', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'Redondo', 'Beach', 'Malibu', 'Torrance', 'Cerritos', '.GRADE', 'C+', 'B-']",N/A
