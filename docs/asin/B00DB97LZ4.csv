My only complaint was the way it was all shrink-wrapped together and a couple of the season boxes were damaged.  When I contacted Amazon about it, they were happy to replace, but it would have to be the entire package, and I could easily see them arriving damaged again.  So a great deal, just be aware if you're a collector and care about condition.",4,Great deal and great show but damaged boxes,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,419,"['love', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'first', '8', 'seasons', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'shrink-wrapped', 'together', 'couple', 'season', 'boxes', 'were', 'damaged', 'When', 'contacted', 'Amazon', 'were', 'happy', 'replace', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'entire', 'package', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'arriving', 'damaged', 'again', 'great', 'deal', 'just', 'be', 'aware', ""'re"", 'collector', 'care', 'condition']",Criminal Minds: Eight Season Pack

It shows what can happen in real life.

They shipped fast and I got it a day after it shipped which was awesome. Yet some of the discs look scratched, I hope they all work I don't think I'll have a problem with it. Also three of the cases are damaged they almost look used. Those are the only reasons I said it was simply okay.",3,Pretty good deal,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,417,"['Criminal', 'Minds', 'great', 'show', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'buy', 'seasons', 'together', 'much', 'cheaper', 'buying', 'separate', 'shipped', 'fast', 'got', 'day', 'shipped', 'was', 'awesome', 'discs', 'look', 'scratched', 'hope', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem', 'Also', 'three', 'cases', 'are', 'damaged', 'almost', 'look', 'used', 'are', 'only', 'reasons', 'said', 'was', 'simply', 'okay']",Criminal Minds: Eight Season Pack
1654710,A1KUWGZ04I0W2R,B00DB97LZ4,Supercalafragilisticexpealadocious,"[6, 6]","This is a review for the show (first 8 seasons itself).  I have only purchased season seven and eight off of Amazon, I already had the first six. The only thing about the DVD's/packaging of the individual seasons themselves is that all but two of them are in a cardboard box and are in the slim cases, this is in my opinion a cheap and crappy way of packaging expensive seasons, but not the worst way, nonetheless, it was not even consistent with two of the other seasons, 5 & 6 are in the great regular plastic cases, then it went back to the slim cases in the cardboard box.Now my review for the show:Criminal Minds is by far the greatest TV show of its kind, no crime show whether it be a Law & Order, CSI, Monk, Castle, or whatever, have been so gutsy, so investing, so brilliantly astonishing in every way! Ever since I saw one episode on TV I was hooked! But after missing an episode here and there it became hard to keep track so I tried to rent them (never do this) and one disk was missing so I went a few years not watching the show, then my mother and I started buying the seasons to get through the winter, we started them long before winter and finished them before too! This show was so engaging, I love the characters, the plots, murders, murders or whatever crimes they have, I have never been so invested in such a show, I wish season 9 would be released already!!!!! I HIGHLY recommend this show, my favorite character is Dr. Spencer Reid. I have yet to see a bad season and hope it ends before that happens. Truly an amazing masterpiece of a show!Criminal Minds: Season 1 - 8 ***** out of *****Criminal Minds: Season 1 ***** out of *****Criminal Minds: Season 2 ***** out of *****Criminal Minds: Season 3 ***** out of *****Criminal Minds: Season 4 ***** out of *****Criminal Minds: Season 5 ***** out of *****Criminal Minds: Season 6 ***** out of *****Criminal Minds: Season 7 ***** out of *****Criminal Minds: Season 8 ***** out of *****Violent Content: 6/10 - Strong Violence, Infrequent Graphic Gory Imagery, Some Bloody Violence.Sexulity/Nudity: 3/10 - Some Strong Dialog and Descriptions of Sexual Activities Including Rape.",5,Review of the show itself,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,2148,"['review', 'show', 'first', '8', 'seasons', 'have', 'only', 'purchased', 'season', 'seven', 'eight', 'Amazon', 'already', 'had', 'first', 'six', 'only', 'thing', ""DVD's/packaging"", 'individual', 'seasons', 'two', 'are', 'cardboard', 'box', 'are', 'slim', 'cases', 'opinion', 'cheap', 'crappy', 'way', 'packaging', 'expensive', 'seasons', 'not', 'worst', 'way', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'consistent', 'two', 'other', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'are', 'great', 'regular', 'plastic', 'cases', 'then', 'went', 'back', 'slim', 'cases', 'cardboard', 'box.Now', 'review', 'show', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'far', 'greatest', 'TV', 'show', 'kind', 'crime', 'show', 'be', 'Law', 'Order', 'CSI', 'Monk', 'Castle', 'whatever', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'gutsy', 'investing', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'astonishing', 'way', 'Ever', 'saw', 'one', 'episode', 'TV', 'was', 'hooked', 'missing', 'episode', 'here', 'there', 'became', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'tried', 'rent', 'never', 'do', 'one', 'disk', 'was', 'missing', 'so', 'went', 'few', 'years', 'not', 'watching', 'show', 'then', 'mother', 'started', 'buying', 'seasons', 'get', 'winter', 'started', 'long', 'before', 'winter', 'finished', 'too', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'engaging', 'love', 'characters', 'plots', 'murders', 'murders', 'crimes', 'have', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'invested', 'such', 'show', 'wish', 'season', '9', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'already', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'show', 'favorite', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Spencer', 'Reid', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'bad', 'season', 'hope', 'Truly', 'amazing', 'masterpiece', 'show', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'Season', '1', '8', '*****', '*****Criminal', 'Minds', 'Season', '1', '*****', '*****Criminal', 'Minds', 'Season', '2', '*****', '*****Criminal', 'Minds', 'Season', '3', '*****', '*****Criminal', 'Minds', 'Season', '4', '*****', '*****Criminal', 'Minds', 'Season', '5', '*****', '*****Criminal', 'Minds', 'Season', '6', '*****', '*****Criminal', 'Minds', 'Season', '7', '*****', '*****Criminal', 'Minds', 'Season', '8', '*****', '*****Violent', 'Content', '6/10', 'Strong', 'Violence', 'Infrequent', 'Graphic', 'Gory', 'Imagery', 'Bloody', 'Violence.Sexulity/Nudity', '3/10', 'Strong', 'Dialog', 'Descriptions', 'Sexual', 'Activities', 'Including', 'Rape']",Criminal Minds: Eight Season Pack
