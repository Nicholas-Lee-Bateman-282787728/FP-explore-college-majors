I haven't seen it in a long time but remember it having those twins from Kindergarten cop in it. If you liked  Problem Child you'll definately enjoy this film. From what I remember it's basically about these twin body builders who are called upon as a last resort to babysit these rich twin terrors! Then after some hilarious pranks are pulled, one of the boys decides to runaway while the other no longer wants to be mean to the new sitters. But instead the boys are kidnapped and the twin sitters save them. I guess the funniest parts in this movie were the twin guys with the muscles coming down the street in that huge wheeled truck and the kids getting them into all sorts of hilarious mishaps! Worth a view, both corny and funny. You should order a pizza and other junk food when watching this movie!",3,childhood memories,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,869,"['remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'enjoying', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'remember', 'having', 'twins', 'Kindergarten', 'cop', 'liked', 'Problem', 'Child', ""'ll"", 'definately', 'enjoy', 'film', 'what', 'remember', 'basically', 'twin', 'body', 'builders', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'upon', 'last', 'resort', 'babysit', 'rich', 'twin', 'terrors', 'Then', 'hilarious', 'pranks', 'are', 'pulled', 'one', 'boys', 'runaway', 'other', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'mean', 'new', 'sitters', 'instead', 'boys', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'twin', 'sitters', 'save', 'guess', 'funniest', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'twin', 'guys', 'muscles', 'coming', 'down', 'street', 'huge', 'wheeled', 'truck', 'kids', 'getting', 'sorts', 'hilarious', 'mishaps', 'view', 'corny', 'funny', 'should', 'order', 'pizza', 'other', 'junk', 'food', 'when', 'watching', 'movie']",N/A

It has comedy with broad appeal, tongue in cheek dialogue, the occasional high-octane explosion or over-the-top comedic fight scene, and no bad language. If the actors were taking themselves seriously, this movie would not be worth a second's viewing, but all of the stars send themselves or their characters up, with the effect that this is a riotous romp across Los Angeles, but with a well inserted message of love, warmth, and mutual reliance, whether it be brothers depending on each other, the importance of family, or the need to look after the brotherhood of man. The kids will enjoy the slapstick and the smart kid characters, and they won't know they're being educated through entertainment, and the adults can enjoy the asides.All this in a movie that stars James Bond and Pontius Pilate!",5,A Riotous Romp,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,909,"['collector', 'who', 'often', 'asked', 'recommend', 'movies', 'one', 'often', 'suggest', 'great', 'family', 'viewing', 'comedy', 'broad', 'appeal', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'dialogue', 'occasional', 'high-octane', 'explosion', 'over-the-top', 'comedic', 'fight', 'scene', 'bad', 'language', 'actors', 'were', 'taking', 'seriously', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'second', 'viewing', 'stars', 'send', 'characters', 'up', 'effect', 'riotous', 'romp', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'well', 'inserted', 'message', 'love', 'warmth', 'mutual', 'reliance', 'be', 'brothers', 'depending', 'other', 'importance', 'family', 'need', 'look', 'brotherhood', 'man', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'slapstick', 'smart', 'kid', 'characters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', ""'re"", 'being', 'educated', 'entertainment', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'asides.All', 'movie', 'James', 'Bond', 'Pontius', 'Pilate']",N/A

You can't watch Mr. Nanny and expect What's Eating Gilbert Grape.You know what you're embarking upon when you watch this movie, so there's really no way you can say you were disappointed.The movie delivers exactly what you would think: Poorly acted dramatic scenes, corny humor, cartoonish pranks, forced dialogue, and some really bad music made by the stars of the film. All of those things are almost implied in the title. You put these two bodybuilders in a comedy film. The creators figure no one will ever watch it. The Barbarian Brothers always wanted to have a music career. BAM. You've created an award-winning soundtrack to go along with this spectacularly poor movie.But those creators were wrong. Very wrong. I watched this movie and I loved it. It's not as bad-good/good-bad as Mr. Nanny, but that was probably more due budgetary constraints. If you enjoy any of the following films, I recommend this movie to you: Problem Child 1 or 2, Magic Kid, Major Payne, or any of the Ernest films.PS: DVDs have been going out of print in recent years. I bought my copy of this gem 2 years ago for 5 dollars and thank my lucky stars I did. Buy yours before it's too late because it's definitely not making it to Blu Ray or whatever the next minor improvement will be to digital home media.",4,The Spectacle is in the Shittiness,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,1344,"['ca', ""n't"", 'eat', 'veggie', 'burger', 'expecting', 'hamburger', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Mr.', 'Nanny', 'expect', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape.You', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'embarking', 'upon', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'really', 'way', 'can', 'say', 'were', 'disappointed.The', 'movie', 'delivers', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'Poorly', 'acted', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'corny', 'humor', 'cartoonish', 'pranks', 'forced', 'dialogue', 'really', 'bad', 'music', 'made', 'stars', 'film', 'things', 'are', 'almost', 'implied', 'title', 'put', 'two', 'bodybuilders', 'comedy', 'film', 'creators', 'figure', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'watch', 'Barbarian', 'Brothers', 'always', 'wanted', 'have', 'music', 'career', 'BAM', ""'ve"", 'created', 'award-winning', 'soundtrack', 'go', 'along', 'spectacularly', 'poor', 'movie.But', 'creators', 'were', 'wrong', 'Very', 'wrong', 'watched', 'movie', 'loved', 'not', 'as', 'bad-good/good-bad', 'Mr.', 'Nanny', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'due', 'budgetary', 'constraints', 'enjoy', 'following', 'films', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Problem', 'Child', '1', '2', 'Magic', 'Kid', 'Major', 'Payne', 'Ernest', 'films.PS', 'DVDs', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'print', 'recent', 'years', 'bought', 'copy', 'gem', '2', 'years', 'ago', '5', 'dollars', 'thank', 'lucky', 'stars', 'did', 'Buy', 'too', 'late', 'definitely', 'not', 'making', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'next', 'minor', 'improvement', 'will', 'be', 'digital', 'home', 'media']",N/A
