1456476,A1WPCLH2ZACWPH,B005EHSH4A,"Charlie B. ""Charlie""","[0, 0]","The gang returns in ""Truth,"" which is a soap opera-esque sequel to the original that started it all.  Laden with drama as the story progresses, the movie definitely holds your attention from beginning to end, but the reward isn't as satisfying as the original.""Truth"" begins with Faybien updating Lonnie, who travels constantly with work, in letters about what's been going on in his life.  We find out that he is working in the music business, Amera has a music career that is starting to take off finally along with a boyfriend, Greg is dating a pre-med student and Amera's cousin who is her stylist, and Jay is still up to his same old scandalous ways.  When Faybien all of a sudden realizes that he loves Lonnie and professes it to him, Lonnie rejects his advances even though Faybien ""proves"" to him how much he's changed.  After a mistake on both of their parts, the two part ways for good it seems.  Meanwhile, everyone else is dealing with their relationship woes. Greg is dealing with his male lover, who is interested in taking their relationship further from just hooking up casually while going out of his way to hide his other relationship with Amera's female cousin.  Amera is struggling with the fact that she believes her boyfriend is cheating on her, and entails her cousin to help investigate as they get their ""proof.""  Jay is in some kind of relationship with a thug who stays with his baby's mother, and is dealing with that the best way he knows how.  After he upsets him and nearly blows his cover, his ""boyfriend"" gets revenge, which is averted when Faybien comes to the rescue.  This brings the two closer and they start to become hang out buddies, which has a negative effect on Faybien.  He starts hooking up and meets someone, drinks a lot, parties every night, and misses work.  When Greg decides to host a dinner party in which Lonnie unexpectantly shows up, Greg reveals the real reason for the dinner and everyone's business is put out on the table.  Confusion amasses and everyone is heated as their ""truth"" is revealed one by one.  Each person reflects on their problems and confronts them, dealing with them as best as they can.The writing doesn't compare to the original, which is a bit of a let down.  Gone is the blueprint for a moral and meaningful story, traded in for unnecessary dramatics.  The script leaves much more to be desired, as it really has no point unless you factor in the whole truth aspect, which is honestly very minimal.  Also, there are tons of loose ends.  Lonnie's blank and expressionless reactions to what he's going through which inhibit him from totally being responsive to Faybien are never revealed.  A mention of a certain medical condition Faybien is suffering from is mentioned matter-of-factly with no back story and seems like it was just thrown in to justify a certain ""crucial"" scene in the film.  It's never explained Jay's motivation for spiking Faybien's drink at the club given what leads up to the actions.  The ending is so abrupt and forced that it leaves you wondering if they were rushing to complete it or what.  They literally summed up each couple's future in about two minutes.  The acting has improved, but the dialogue has not.  The locations and sets are also better than the first.  There are a couple of filming issues like camera shakiness where it shouldn't be, but not as bad as the first.With all that said, the movie is average, and a great must-see for fans of the original.  Don't expect too much, but just enough to make you fall in love with the characters all over again.  Would love to see a third installment if they decide to make it happen.",3,"Not in the Same Vein as the First, but a Worthy Follow-Up",1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,3646,"['gang', 'returns', 'Truth', 'soap', 'opera-esque', 'sequel', 'original', 'started', 'Laden', 'drama', 'story', 'movie', 'definitely', 'attention', 'beginning', 'end', 'reward', ""n't"", 'as', 'satisfying', 'original', 'Truth', 'Faybien', 'updating', 'Lonnie', 'who', 'constantly', 'work', 'letters', 'what', 'been', 'going', 'life', 'find', 'out', 'working', 'music', 'business', 'Amera', 'music', 'career', 'starting', 'take', 'off', 'finally', 'along', 'boyfriend', 'Greg', 'dating', 'pre-med', 'student', 'Amera', 'cousin', 'who', 'stylist', 'Jay', 'still', 'up', 'same', 'old', 'scandalous', 'ways', 'When', 'Faybien', 'sudden', 'realizes', 'Lonnie', 'Lonnie', 'advances', 'even', 'Faybien', 'proves', 'how', 'much', 'changed', 'mistake', 'parts', 'two', 'part', 'ways', 'good', 'Meanwhile', 'everyone', 'else', 'dealing', 'relationship', 'woes', 'Greg', 'dealing', 'male', 'lover', 'who', 'interested', 'taking', 'relationship', 'further', 'just', 'hooking', 'up', 'casually', 'going', 'way', 'hide', 'other', 'relationship', 'Amera', 'female', 'cousin', 'Amera', 'struggling', 'fact', 'boyfriend', 'cheating', 'cousin', 'help', 'investigate', 'get', 'proof', 'Jay', 'kind', 'relationship', 'thug', 'who', 'baby', 'mother', 'dealing', 'best', 'way', 'how', 'nearly', 'cover', 'boyfriend', 'revenge', 'averted', 'when', 'Faybien', 'rescue', 'two', 'closer', 'start', 'become', 'hang', 'buddies', 'negative', 'effect', 'Faybien', 'hooking', 'up', 'meets', 'someone', 'lot', 'parties', 'night', 'work', 'When', 'Greg', 'host', 'dinner', 'party', 'Lonnie', 'unexpectantly', 'up', 'Greg', 'real', 'reason', 'dinner', 'everyone', 'business', 'put', 'out', 'table', 'Confusion', 'amasses', 'everyone', 'heated', 'truth', 'revealed', 'one', 'one', 'person', 'problems', 'confronts', 'dealing', 'as', 'best', 'can.The', 'writing', ""n't"", 'compare', 'original', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'Gone', 'blueprint', 'moral', 'meaningful', 'story', 'traded', 'unnecessary', 'dramatics', 'script', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'desired', 'really', 'point', 'factor', 'whole', 'truth', 'aspect', 'honestly', 'very', 'minimal', 'Also', 'are', 'tons', 'loose', 'ends', 'Lonnie', 'blank', 'expressionless', 'reactions', 'what', 'going', 'inhibit', 'totally', 'being', 'responsive', 'Faybien', 'are', 'never', 'revealed', 'mention', 'certain', 'medical', 'condition', 'Faybien', 'suffering', 'mentioned', 'matter-of-factly', 'back', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'thrown', 'justify', 'certain', 'crucial', 'scene', 'film', 'never', 'explained', 'Jay', 'motivation', 'spiking', 'Faybien', 'drink', 'club', 'given', 'what', 'up', 'actions', 'ending', 'so', 'abrupt', 'forced', 'wondering', 'were', 'rushing', 'complete', 'what', 'literally', 'summed', 'up', 'couple', 'future', 'about', 'two', 'minutes', 'acting', 'improved', 'dialogue', 'not', 'locations', 'sets', 'are', 'also', 'better', 'first', 'are', 'couple', 'filming', 'issues', 'camera', 'shakiness', 'where', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'first.With', 'said', 'movie', 'average', 'great', 'must-see', 'fans', 'original', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'characters', 'over', 'again', 'Would', 'love', 'see', 'third', 'installment', 'decide', 'make', 'happen']",Finding Me: Truth

1456482,A2PL4KP6QX65EA,B005EHSH4A,Richard C. Jones,"[0, 0]","I purchased Finding Me: Truth through another venue, and really hold any expectations of the film. Some scenes were dark in nature. RayMartell Moore's acting was over the top and amateurish. His overacting overshadowed every scene he appeared in. Derrick L. Briggs I thought brought more emotional angst and depth to his role as the romantically beleaguered Lonnie. He added some twinge of guilt as he tries to reconnect with Moore's character Fabien. Even during the director's commentary, director Roger Omeus admits he added more to the film, which I thought extended the film by needless cutaway's to montages to J'Nara Corbin's Amera's rising musical diva character. The B and C storylines involving Eli and Jay and Omar distracted the viewer from what was actually going on with Lonnie. It was great to see the universe in FMT expanding, but not at the expense of stronger story. I thought the additions of Reggie and Gabe were probably more interesting than cardboard Omar and Tasha. I thought the overall movie was more plot driven than character driven and I'm glad I copped this while at a going-out-of-business sale.",2,Finding Me Truth should have found more consitency,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1127,"['purchased', 'Finding', 'Me', 'Truth', 'venue', 'really', 'hold', 'expectations', 'film', 'scenes', 'were', 'dark', 'nature', 'RayMartell', 'Moore', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'amateurish', 'overacting', 'overshadowed', 'scene', 'appeared', 'Derrick', 'L.', 'Briggs', 'thought', 'brought', 'more', 'emotional', 'angst', 'depth', 'role', 'romantically', 'beleaguered', 'Lonnie', 'added', 'twinge', 'guilt', 'reconnect', 'Moore', 'character', 'Fabien', 'Even', 'director', 'commentary', 'director', 'Roger', 'Omeus', 'added', 'more', 'film', 'thought', 'extended', 'film', 'needless', 'cutaway', 'montages', ""J'Nara"", 'Corbin', 'Amera', 'rising', 'musical', 'diva', 'character', 'B', 'C', 'storylines', 'involving', 'Eli', 'Jay', 'Omar', 'distracted', 'viewer', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'Lonnie', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'universe', 'FMT', 'expanding', 'not', 'expense', 'stronger', 'story', 'thought', 'additions', 'Reggie', 'Gabe', 'were', 'probably', 'more', 'interesting', 'cardboard', 'Omar', 'Tasha', 'thought', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'plot', 'driven', 'character', 'driven', ""'m"", 'glad', 'copped', 'while', 'going-out-of-business', 'sale']",Finding Me: Truth

1456484,A3F2LSOZYJUTKO,B005EHSH4A,"Zee Jai ""Liberator migr ire""","[1, 3]","There's a lot to like about Finding Me: Truth, but the flaws in this sequel to 2009's Finding Me sadly outweigh the positives.We rejoin Jersey City friends Faybien (RayMartell Moore), Greg (Eugene E. Turner), and Amera (J'Nara Corbin), all of whom are struggling with romantic issues of one kind or another. Added into the mix is toxic Jay, Greg's unwelcome roommate, played by Maurice Murrell.Murrell, of course, died suddenly earlier this year, aged just 32, so it's nice to be able to report he's one of the best things in this film - shamelessly stealing every scene as a poisonous bad boy bent on taking everyone in his path down with him.Moore is cute as pretty boy toy Faybien and, when he's given enough to do (blowing his top with Jay comes to mind), proves he can act. Corbin's Amera grates, however: she shrieks her way through the movie, bulldozing her way through every scene like a drunk drag queen in a funeral parlour. It's supposed to be funny, but every appearance has the same effect as fingernails on a blackboard. Dial it down next time - sometimes, less is more.The film's producers have decided a revenge attack on whitey is the best way to make up for lack of black visibility in gay cinema: The two white characters who appear are deliberately distasteful, particularly Jay's friend Neal. Intriguing that each and every one of the black actors are (more or less) dazzlingly attractive, whilst Neal is a nasty queen who looks like an anemic weasel. God bless separatist America and all who sail in her!Still, it falls to Neal to deliver one of the movie's most apt lines. ""I feel like I'm watching three different TV shows,"" he remarks during a disastrous dinner party. You are, Neal, and they all air in the daytime. This isn't cutting edge, arthouse cinema. It's not even mainstream cinema. It's sub-""Noah's Arc"" soap, of the E. Lynn Harris variety, and pretty clumsy soap at that (the dinner party scene is the most idiotic, ill-conceived deus ex machina you're likely to see in a film).If endless deliberations about feelings and relationships are your bag, this is for you. Just don't take it too seriously: watch with friends, plenty of alcohol, and enjoy the cute boys. But really: gay cinema - and black gay cinema - can be so much better than this.",2,The truth?
