I don't remember a romantic action comedy this good since Romancing the Stone in the 80s. Steve Carrell and Tina Fey play a ""boring married couple from New Jersey"" who try to add some spice to their marriage by going on a date night in the city where they are mistaken for a couple involved in blackmail and chased all over town by thugs. The story is mediocre, but Carrell and Fey have outstanding chemistry and do a wonderful job of portraying a very normal couple in extremely absurd circumstances. Nothing profound or artistic here, but there are some tender moments interspersed with the raunchy humor and nearly nonstop action.

1301376,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B002ZG97B0,amerdale876,"[3, 6]","For a film that has a target audience - parents - Shawn Levy's latest film, ""Date Night,"" is hilarious! Levy, best known for his family movie fare (Big Fat Liar (Full Screen Edition),Cheaper By the Dozen,The Pink Panther (Special Edition),Night at the Museum (Widescreen Edition)), takes his humor up a notch and applies it to a more mature audience. Starring a dream team of comic geniuses Steve Carell (Office: Seasons 1-5) and Tina Fey (30 Rock: Seasons 1-3), ""Date Night"" tells the story of a couple whose marriage has fizzled somewhat due to the every day occurrences of career and kids. Then, one night, on their date night, they lie to get a seat in the city's trendiest restaurant. And that's just the start of their problems.The best thing about ""Date Night"" was its unpredictable charm, as well as its unpretentious seriousness and fun. Sure, most parents and married couples will laugh a little harder at the jokes and situations rather than younger, single audience members. But, with Carell and Fey heading a great cast (Ari Graynor, who has a small cameo appearance as one of Carell's clients, is so hilarious and definitely needs to headline her own movie), it's an enjoyable ride for anyone! The only slightly bad criticism I would have for the movie is that I thought the humor would've slightly been more plentiful what with Carell and Fey and their proclivity for ad-libbing.

1301380,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG97B0,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","`Date Night', while consistently funny, doesn't deliver the laughs I was expecting.  Maybe that's because the plot is so contrived and unevenly distributed that you wind up scratching your head instead of focusing on the humor.  Thankfully the two leads carry this film rather well, and the sprinkling of familiar faces in smaller roles is a nice touch, but overall I was a little disappointed with the finished product.The film follows a crazy night that ensues after a middle-aged married couple named Phil and Claire Foster falsely claim to be the `no show' Tripplehorn's at a posh restaurant.  Thoroughly enjoying themselves, their night is tarnished when they are accosted by two corrupt police officers threatening to kill them if they don't hand over the property they stole from their `boss'.  Narrowly escaping death, the Fosters then enlist the help of on of Claire's former clients in order to outwit the thugs and save their family from danger.I'll just say, Carell and Fey have great chemistry.  They interact beautifully and they really flesh out natural and relatable characters here.  You feel like you know them or at least want to know them.  The overall storyline is a tad underdeveloped and overworked.  There is almost too much going on but not enough real thought put into making the flow feel structured or even coherent.  It kind of bounces around with moments that feel great and others that just lack in many areas.  In then end, it just doesn't make a lot of sense AT ALL.  The barrage of supporting players (everyone from Oscar nominees like Mark Wahlberg and Taraji P. Henson to musicians like Common and `hot commodities' like James Franco, Mila Kunis and Leighton Meester show up here, not to mention the comedic frequents like Kristen Wiig and the reliable character actors like Mark Ruffalo and William Fichtner) works well for me (I know some weren't keen on it).  They all seem to know their places well.There are some memorable lines here, although the dialog is not as fresh or as sharp as I expected.  Still, Carell and Fey work what magic they can and the overall feel of the film is one that is warm and humorous.You'll enjoy it, even if it doesn't live up to expectations.",3,"Choppy, uneven fun...",1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,2213,"['Date', 'Night', 'consistently', 'funny', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'laughs', 'was', 'expecting', 'Maybe', 'plot', 'so', 'contrived', 'unevenly', 'distributed', 'wind', 'up', 'scratching', 'head', 'instead', 'focusing', 'humor', 'Thankfully', 'two', 'leads', 'carry', 'film', 'rather', 'well', 'sprinkling', 'familiar', 'smaller', 'roles', 'nice', 'touch', 'overall', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'finished', 'product.The', 'film', 'crazy', 'night', 'middle-aged', 'married', 'couple', 'named', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'Foster', 'falsely', 'claim', 'be', 'show', 'Tripplehorn', 'posh', 'restaurant', 'Thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'night', 'tarnished', 'when', 'are', 'accosted', 'two', 'corrupt', 'police', 'officers', 'threatening', 'kill', 'do', ""n't"", 'hand', 'property', 'stole', 'boss', 'Narrowly', 'escaping', 'death', 'Fosters', 'then', 'enlist', 'help', 'Claire', 'former', 'clients', 'order', 'outwit', 'thugs', 'save', 'family', 'danger.I', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'Carell', 'Fey', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'interact', 'beautifully', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'natural', 'relatable', 'characters', 'here', 'feel', 'know', 'least', 'want', 'know', 'overall', 'storyline', 'tad', 'underdeveloped', 'overworked', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'not', 'enough', 'real', 'thought', 'put', 'making', 'flow', 'feel', 'structured', 'even', 'coherent', 'kind', 'bounces', 'moments', 'feel', 'great', 'others', 'just', 'lack', 'many', 'areas', 'then', 'end', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'AT', 'ALL', 'barrage', 'supporting', 'players', 'everyone', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'musicians', 'Common', 'hot', 'commodities', 'James', 'Franco', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'show', 'up', 'here', 'not', 'mention', 'comedic', 'frequents', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'reliable', 'character', 'actors', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'well', 'know', 'were', ""n't"", 'keen', 'seem', 'know', 'places', 'are', 'memorable', 'lines', 'here', 'dialog', 'not', 'fresh', 'as', 'sharp', 'expected', 'Still', 'Carell', 'Fey', 'work', 'what', 'can', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'one', 'warm', 'humorous.You', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'even', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations']",N/A

I mean, the story line was such that the movie itself couldn't seem to decide what it wanted to be, so how could Carell and Fay?OK, imagine that you are a screenwriter and you want to catch people's attention...what do you throw into the film?

1301383,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B002ZG97B0,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 6]","Tina Fey is one of the funniest people, not just ladies, working today. She made SNL worth watching for her segments alone, wrote one of the biggest surprise hits in recent memory: Mean Girls, has one of the few legitimately funny shows on tv, and managed to make something good out of Sarah Palin. Give the woman a medal. Steve Carrell ain't doing too shabby either. So the two together in a movie should be hilarious, right? Well, yeah, it should, but here with Date Night, it makes you wonder how much better the movie would've been if Fey had written the script instead of the guy who wrote the last 2 Shrek movies. Still, Date Night is a very cute, lighthearted comedy with some moments that are sure to get light chuckles. It's perfect for couples to watch for a movie night, especially if they're sick of the standard romantic comedy with younger people in the leading roles with a fraction of the charisma.Phil and Claire Foster are a successful married couple living a good life. They have a nice home, good paying jobs and two young children. Things are getting a bit repetitive in their life though, and there isn't much of a spark any more, though they aren't unhappy with one another. When they get the news that a couple they know is getting divorced, that serves as the red flag for them that it could possibly happen to them too. So Phil tries to get reservations for a fancy restaurant, but has no luck, as it takes months to get through the waiting list. They still go, and take someone else's seats, and enjoy a few minutes before being taken outside by two thugs. What ensues is a crazy night out that they didn't have planned. Car chases, shoot 'em up action, a strip club and more...who knew you could get into so much trouble just by taking someone else's seats?I really liked the first half of Date Night. The Fosters are a believable couple and do some things that real couples can relate to. Not being 'in the mood' but ruining it for the other person by doing little things, like taking out their retainer and doing the whole 'I guess we can' deal. Mark Wahlberg steals every scene he's in, and even after hearing about this, seeing the bits with him in them are funnier than what I imagined. But the movie keeps going on with crazy things to the point where it becomes an action-comedy halfway through. That's not to say that it gets bad, but I would've rather things stuck to the romantic-comedy for 'older' people bit instead. But as I said earlier, if Fey wrote the script, I'm sure everything would've been much better. A lot of the jokes here seem beneath the lead actors, or like rough drafts of jokes they were working on but didn't finish. But as a simple date movie, Date Night gets the job done. And hey, I'm all for any movie that has Tina Fey running around in a low cut dress and taking charge with the 1-2-3 rule. When a lady can halt gangsters from peeling caps like bananas with the 1-2-3 thing, you know not to mess with her.The picture quality of the blu-ray looks pretty good for the most part. A lot of the action scenes are sharp and clear, but some scenes shot mostly in the dark are full of grain. It's nothing that should bug most people, especially since this isn't exactly a movie to show off your home theater. The audio gets a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround mix, but doesn't make much use of it. Almost everything is front-centric, and the only times the surround gets any use is during the scenes with guns and the car chase. Everything else is as basic as it gets.Special features-wise, there's more here than I expected, but like the picture/audio, it's all average. There's a commentary with the director, Shawn Levy. I actually got sick of listening to him talk after the first 15 minutes, as the guy's more full of himself than Gus Van Sant, and I don't think he realizes that he didn't exactly make a huge hit here. Still, he gives plenty of good information, and is at least passionate about what he does. The deleted scenes run for about 5 minutes and none of them stood out much, a lot like the extended scenes. They really should've just let the actors improvise more rather than try for extended scenes. ATL City is alternate takes of jokes in the movie, but again, nothing stands out. Directing 301 is good for aspiring filmmakers, as it shows what goes on behind the camera, but if you're serious about the profession, you're better off with one of Robert Rodriguez's earlier films on dvd/blu-ray (hint- Desperado or El Mariachi). Disaster Dates is most of the actors in the movie talking about their worst dates, and this is one of the extras worth watching, along with the gag reel. Finally are the trailer, a wardrobe/lighting test with the actors, another directing bit with Levy, and PSAs with Tina and Steve where they try to get you to join Date Night. Think of it as an alternate trailer.For a movie that's simply cute, they sure did try to give this some serious treatment on blu-ray, but everything's so average that I can't give it more than 3 stars. As it stands, you can do a heck of a lot worse than Date Night, and it's at least worth a rental. There's something for guys, and something for ladies here, and that's more than I can say for most of the romantic-comedies I've seen over the years.",3,A cute movie that could've been

Unable to get into the restaurant of their choice, they take the reservation of a couple that is a no-show, and thus their troubles begin. Mistaken for the other couple, the pair end up running for their lives. A series of crazy things happen to them as they struggle to make it through the night alive with the pair ending up on a roof top with a group of armed and dangerous killers. The crowning comedic moment is when the wife tells the men to put down their weapons or she will start counting. They are all in disbelief when she actually does and begin to put down their weapons. What makes this moment so hilarious  for me is the fact that I have used the counting method repeatedly as a discipline action for my own daughter who always complies by the count of two.

It's not because I hate them- I just don't find either of them particularly funny most of the time.  However, given the nature of the plotline, I have to make an exception in this case.It's about Steve and Tina being happily married, and one night they go to a restaurant and take another couples dinner reservations by stealing their names when it's discovered the two people originally intended for the restaurant never show up.  This spells doom a short time later, as two bad guys come out of nowhere, walk up to both Steve and Tina while they're drinking wine at the dinner table, and demand that the two of them take a walk outside.Of course Steve and Tina believe the bad guys are actually working for security and are only there to kick them out of the restaurant, but it's quickly discovered these bad guys have something else completely in mind.  They believe Steve and Tina are the two people who made the reservations at the restaurant while being completely unaware Steve and Tina are only pretending to be them.  Oops!  hahaFrom here, the storyline is one outrageous, fast-paced comedy adventure with Steve and Tina running around town searching for clues on how to stop the bad guys from killing them.  This involves segments pertaining to car chases, gun shootings, breaking and entering buildings, etc.What makes the humor work is the way Steve and Tina communicate with each other.  They treat the entire event like it's a big game and don't take it seriously at *all*.  This leads to plenty of whacky segments that pretty much mock the entire genre of action movies, but oh well- it's funny.Decent acting, a surprising amount of laughs, and a good storyline make Date Night a pretty solid comedy.",4,pretty darn funny,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1810,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'biggest', 'NON', 'supporter', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Tiny', 'Fey', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'not', 'hate', 'them-', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'funny', 'most', 'time', 'However', 'given', 'nature', 'plotline', 'have', 'make', 'exception', 'case.It', 'Steve', 'Tina', 'being', 'happily', 'married', 'one', 'night', 'go', 'restaurant', 'take', 'couples', 'dinner', 'reservations', 'stealing', 'names', 'when', 'discovered', 'two', 'people', 'originally', 'intended', 'restaurant', 'never', 'show', 'up', 'short', 'time', 'later', 'two', 'bad', 'guys', 'come', 'nowhere', 'walk', 'Steve', 'Tina', ""'re"", 'drinking', 'wine', 'dinner', 'table', 'demand', 'two', 'take', 'walk', 'outside.Of', 'course', 'Steve', 'Tina', 'believe', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'actually', 'working', 'security', 'are', 'only', 'there', 'kick', 'restaurant', 'quickly', 'discovered', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'completely', 'mind', 'believe', 'Steve', 'Tina', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'reservations', 'restaurant', 'being', 'completely', 'unaware', 'Steve', 'Tina', 'are', 'only', 'pretending', 'be', 'hahaFrom', 'here', 'storyline', 'one', 'outrageous', 'fast-paced', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'Steve', 'Tina', 'running', 'around', 'town', 'searching', 'clues', 'how', 'stop', 'bad', 'guys', 'killing', 'segments', 'pertaining', 'car', 'chases', 'gun', 'shootings', 'breaking', 'entering', 'buildings', 'humor', 'work', 'way', 'Steve', 'Tina', 'communicate', 'other', 'treat', 'entire', 'event', 'big', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', '*all*', 'plenty', 'whacky', 'segments', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'genre', 'action', 'movies', 'oh', 'well-', 'funny.Decent', 'acting', 'surprising', 'amount', 'laughs', 'good', 'storyline', 'make', 'Date', 'Night', 'pretty', 'solid', 'comedy']",N/A

1301399,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG97B0,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 7]","I cannot think of a better pairing than Steve Carell and Tina Fey, not only because they're funny, not only because they're gifted at improvisation, but also because they possess an actor's sense of timing. Comedy is not only about letting loose physically and verbally; it's also about knowing when to hold back. Carell and Fey get this, and they put it to good use in ""Date Night""; when they're not engaging in over the top sequences that merge summer action with slapstick, then they're taking part in quiet moments of surprising insight and tenderness. Regardless of the situation they find themselves in, they're consistently convincing, both as individuals and as a married couple. I responded more to them than to the relentlessly screwball plot, a cross between a crime caper and a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch.Carell and Fey play Phil and Claire Foster, a suburban New Jersey couple who find themselves in a domestic rut so deep, they're no longer satisfied with their weekly date nights at a local steakhouse. Hoping to shake up the routine, Phil takes Claire to a trendy seafood restaurant in Manhattan, only to find out that no one without a reservation made months in advance is likely to be served. A reservation for Tripplehorn, party of two, goes unclaimed, giving Phil and Claire the opportunity to have dinner in their place.What seemed like a good idea at the time quickly becomes a nightmarish case of mistaken identity, the Fosters unwittingly drawn into a plot involving two corrupt police officers (Common and Jimmi Simpson), a ruthless mob boss (Ray Liotta), Manhattan's District Attorney (William Fitchner), and an elusive memory stick containing sensitive data. What exactly have the Tripplehorns gotten themselves into? And how can the Fosters get themselves out of it?Claire, a real estate agent, appeals to one of her clients, who she remembers as being an expert in homeland security. Here enters Holbrook Grant (Mark Wahlberg), who lives in a luxurious apartment, has high tech equipment in his office, and never, ever wears a shirt. How exactly does he help the Fosters? What does it matter? All anyone notices is that he never, ever wears a shirt. This is a direct hit on Phil's ego. I can't say I blame him -- one look at Mark Wahlberg, and my self esteem plummets faster than a lead weight.As the Fosters run for their lives on the streets of New York City, they find themselves trying to assess the state of their marriage, which, like so many real life marriages, is hampered by work, children, and a lack of intimacy. What could have easily been an opportunity for desperate jokiness is instead an amusing yet honest opportunity for character development; when Phil and Claire fight, we really do believe they're fighting, not only because of their style of delivery but also because they're making valid points. We may laugh at their quirks, such as their tendency to look at dining couples and manufacture a conversation, but we still believe them as ordinary people in an extraordinary situation. We also believe it when they make it clear that, despite a domestic lull, they truly do love each other.Perhaps I'm flawed in that I found this aspect of ""Date Night"" more appealing than its sense of humor. There are a number of highly comedic scenes, although most felt incredibly forced. Consider, for instance, a sequence in which Phil and Claire must perform a pole dance; the circumstances surrounding this moment seem solid enough, but the dance itself is so obvious that it might as well be paired with subtitles reading, ""This is funny because they have no idea how to pole dance."" Also consider a car chase near the end of the film; excitement gives way to silliness when the Fosters plow directly into the front end of a cab, joining the two vehicles together. I grant you that this makes the idea less routine. Nevertheless, I have a feeling it would have been just as funny if only one car had been involved.The director is Shawn Levy, whose recent filmography -- the 2006 remake of ""The Pink Panther"" and both ""Night at the Museums"" -- has mired him in mediocrity. ""Date Night"" is a definite improvement, although I think it has more to do with casting than with plot. Steve Carell and Tina Fey just work well together. I would be neither surprised nor displeased if they were paired in future films, even if all of them turn out to be comedies. Given their quieter moments in this film, however, and given Carell's successful turn in the wonderful ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" we should not rule out the possibility of dramatic roles. If we've learned anything from Carol Burnett, it's that sometimes, even the funniest people can break our hearts.",4,Never Take Someone Else's Reservation,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,4695,"['can', 'not', 'think', 'better', 'pairing', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'not', 'only', ""'re"", 'funny', 'not', 'only', ""'re"", 'gifted', 'improvisation', 'also', 'possess', 'actor', 'sense', 'timing', 'Comedy', 'not', 'only', 'letting', 'loose', 'physically', 'verbally', 'also', 'about', 'knowing', 'when', 'hold', 'back', 'Carell', 'Fey', 'get', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'Date', 'Night', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'engaging', 'top', 'sequences', 'merge', 'summer', 'action', 'slapstick', 'then', ""'re"", 'taking', 'part', 'quiet', 'moments', 'surprising', 'insight', 'tenderness', 'Regardless', 'situation', 'find', ""'re"", 'consistently', 'convincing', 'individuals', 'married', 'couple', 'responded', 'more', 'relentlessly', 'screwball', 'plot', 'cross', 'crime', 'caper', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'sketch.Carell', 'Fey', 'play', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'Foster', 'suburban', 'New', 'Jersey', 'couple', 'who', 'find', 'domestic', 'rut', 'so', 'deep', ""'re"", 'longer', 'satisfied', 'weekly', 'date', 'nights', 'local', 'steakhouse', 'Hoping', 'shake', 'up', 'routine', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'trendy', 'seafood', 'restaurant', 'Manhattan', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'reservation', 'made', 'months', 'advance', 'likely', 'be', 'served', 'reservation', 'Tripplehorn', 'party', 'two', 'unclaimed', 'giving', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'opportunity', 'have', 'dinner', 'place.What', 'seemed', 'good', 'idea', 'time', 'quickly', 'nightmarish', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'Fosters', 'unwittingly', 'plot', 'involving', 'two', 'corrupt', 'police', 'officers', 'Common', 'Jimmi', 'Simpson', 'ruthless', 'mob', 'boss', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Manhattan', 'District', 'Attorney', 'William', 'Fitchner', 'elusive', 'memory', 'stick', 'containing', 'sensitive', 'data', 'What', 'exactly', 'have', 'Tripplehorns', 'gotten', 'how', 'can', 'Fosters', 'get', 'Claire', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'appeals', 'one', 'clients', 'who', 'being', 'expert', 'homeland', 'security', 'Here', 'enters', 'Holbrook', 'Grant', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'luxurious', 'apartment', 'high', 'tech', 'equipment', 'office', 'never', 'ever', 'shirt', 'How', 'exactly', 'help', 'Fosters', 'What', 'matter', 'anyone', 'notices', 'never', 'ever', 'shirt', 'direct', 'hit', 'Phil', 'ego', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'blame', 'one', 'look', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'self', 'esteem', 'plummets', 'faster', 'lead', 'weight.As', 'Fosters', 'run', 'lives', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'find', 'trying', 'assess', 'state', 'marriage', 'so', 'many', 'real', 'life', 'marriages', 'hampered', 'work', 'children', 'lack', 'intimacy', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'opportunity', 'desperate', 'jokiness', 'instead', 'amusing', 'yet', 'honest', 'opportunity', 'character', 'development', 'when', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'fight', 'really', 'do', 'believe', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'not', 'only', 'style', 'delivery', 'also', ""'re"", 'making', 'valid', 'points', 'may', 'laugh', 'quirks', 'such', 'tendency', 'look', 'dining', 'couples', 'manufacture', 'conversation', 'still', 'believe', 'ordinary', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'situation', 'also', 'believe', 'when', 'make', 'clear', 'domestic', 'lull', 'truly', 'do', 'love', 'other.Perhaps', ""'m"", 'flawed', 'found', 'aspect', 'Date', 'Night', 'more', 'appealing', 'sense', 'humor', 'are', 'number', 'highly', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'most', 'felt', 'incredibly', 'forced', 'Consider', 'instance', 'sequence', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'must', 'perform', 'pole', 'dance', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'moment', 'seem', 'solid', 'enough', 'dance', 'so', 'obvious', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'paired', 'subtitles', 'reading', 'funny', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'pole', 'dance', 'Also', 'consider', 'car', 'chase', 'end', 'film', 'excitement', 'way', 'silliness', 'when', 'Fosters', 'plow', 'directly', 'front', 'end', 'cab', 'joining', 'two', 'vehicles', 'together', 'grant', 'idea', 'less', 'routine', 'Nevertheless', 'have', 'feeling', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'funny', 'only', 'one', 'car', 'had', 'been', 'involved.The', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'recent', 'filmography', '2006', 'remake', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Night', 'Museums', 'mired', 'mediocrity', 'Date', 'Night', 'definite', 'improvement', 'think', 'more', 'do', 'casting', 'plot', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'just', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'neither', 'surprised', 'displeased', 'were', 'paired', 'future', 'films', 'even', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'comedies', 'Given', 'quieter', 'moments', 'film', 'however', 'given', 'Carell', 'successful', 'turn', 'wonderful', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'should', 'not', 'rule', 'possibility', 'dramatic', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'anything', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'sometimes', 'even', 'funniest', 'people', 'can', 'break', 'hearts']",N/A

Henson, Jimmi Simpson, Common, William Fichtner, Ray Liotta, Kristen Wiig, Mark Ruffalo, Leighton Meester, James Franco, Mila Kunis, Will i Am and Olivia MunnWRITTEN BY: Josh KlausnerDIRECTED BY: Shawn LevyRated: PG - 13Genre: ComedyRelease Date: 09 April 2010Review Date: 28 June 2010They say the number one rule in comedy is timing. If that is true (and it very easily could be) then Steve Carell and Tina Fey are truly masters of their craft. Their on-screen chemistry is right up there with the best we've seen in any comedy, to include Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller or Chris Farley and David Spade. Fey and Carell make Date Night one of the funniest flicks of the year.They play Claire and Phil Foster. They've been married for quite a while, share a beautiful home with their kids, and live quiet little lives in the suburbs. All of this is bought by us from the get-go by the way. It never smells or tastes like a movie; it easily could be their real life if we didn't know them as Steve Carell and Tina Fey.The Fosters are very much in love and their marriage is sweet and endearing, but they are tired, stressed, and their love life can sometimes be put on the back burner. I've always felt the key to getting people to laugh, is to show them something they can relate to, and so many of us can relate to their set-up.Basically the only thing keeping any small amount of spice lingering at the dusty bottom of their romance jar is their weekly date night. When we meet them, they are so drained from the unrelenting work-week they've just had, that they almost agree to can that week's night out. But common sense and the film's title tell us that that won't happen.The plot is simple but yet somehow refreshing and very entertaining. They show up to the restaurant and they don't have a reservation properly placed. The film cleverly has given us a few tiny well-written moments that tell us Mr. Foster is not going to take no for an answer; he's out with his wife and they are going to have a good time. A smile was pierced to my face watching Carrel's performance as he thought up a brilliant lie that would kick off the entire film.When he hears the name of another couple being called for their table, and they are nowhere to be found, he claims he and Claire are in fact those being called upon. They are seated and Claire is impressed and things look like they are going to work out pretty nicely.But then they are approached by two men who create one of the best moments in any comedy - where we know what's going on and the characters are both talking about two completely different events. The men ask them to come outside with them in regards to something they have done, and naturally Claire and Phil think they are talking about the reservation. Classic.What we have in reality is a case of mistaken identity. The two men do not work for the restaurant and are not the least bit friendly. They believe Claire and Phil are the couple whose reservation they stole, and that they have something they want. Claire and Phil naturally have no idea what the heck they are talking about - and there you have the plot.The clock is ticking, the police become involved but can't be confided in and there are shootouts, car chases and all kinds of humorous moments to be had. It was a tad ridiculous in a few spots, but never stopped being fun and we are laughing from beginning to end.I particularly enjoyed the scenes with Mark Wahlberg's character, Holbrooke. The Fosters confide in him for helpful advice and every time they visit his apartment he has his shirt off and has been having hot sex with his foreign mistress who wants the Fosters to join them. Phil is so uncomfortable with Mark's character being shirtless in front of his wife that he repeatedly makes one hilarious one-liner after another in reference to him putting on a shirt, and they all had me in stitches. Steve Carell is a comedic genius and you can see just how amazing he is at riffing on the spot if you stick around for the credits which are matched with outtakes.And I'm so fond of Tina Fey. She is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood and she is without a doubt the funniest. She's a real treat in this film and if you haven't seen her in Baby Mama, you need to.Lastly I guess the only thing left to say is... no I can't...it's too much... oh what the heck: Date Night would be a great movie to watch on date night (insert sarcastic laugh with appropriately engaged cheesy face here).",4,Date Night Review,1295481600,"01 20, 2011",2011,4550,"['DATE', 'NIGHTSTARRING',

The Hangover worked because they were not afraid of being completely stupid. Date Night will make you laugh. However,you will definately not be rolling around on the floor.

1301416,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002ZG97B0,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","Pairing Steve Carell and Tina Fey as a married couple in a movie is genuinely inspired casting, primarily because they both have razor-sharp improvisational skills that bring out the best in their respective comedy styles. This 2010 comedy vehicle definitely benefits from their mutually compatible presence, but neither Josh Klausner's overly formulaic script nor Shawn Levy's (Night at the Museum) wildly uneven direction can quite measure up to the stars' talents. In fact, Carell and Fey shine the most during the all-too-brief closing credits when a series of bloopers roll where each take tops the previous one with an even more hilarious line reading. Judd Apatow calls these kinds of clips ""line-o-rama's"" on his DVD extras forThe 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Up, and one hopes the producers of this movie will include much more of the co-stars' riffing once the DVD becomes available.The story begins with the drab domestic existence that Phil and Claire Foster play out every day as an ordinary couple living in the New Jersey suburbs. He's a tax accountant, and she's a real estate agent. Married with two children, their well-ordered lives include weekly date nights. These consist of eating the same food at the same local restaurant, the Teaneck Tavern, where one gets the sense that they truly enjoy each other's company. They make a comic routine of imagining what they perceive to be the more interesting lives of the diners at the nearby tables. However, once they find out their best friends are getting a divorce out of sheer boredom with each other, Phil and Claire become concerned they will suffer the same fate. On a whim, Phil decides to take Claire to the trendy Manhattan seafood restaurant she has been dying to try. When they begin to realize they will never get a table, Phil impulsively steals the reservation for a no-show couple. This becomes the turning point for all the shenanigans that follow as the couple they pretend to be are in a great deal of hot water.From that point forward, the movie turns into a cross between Martin Scorsese'sAfter Hours, Woody Allen'sManhattan Murder Mystery, and any number of high-priced action films with heavily orchestrated car chases and acrobatic gunplay. The leitmotif appears to be borrowed heavily from Alfred Hitchcock'sNorth by Northwestin that an innocent couple is pursued relentlessly by unseemly thugs convinced they are carrying an important flash drive containing blackmail information. However predictable the plot turns, Carell and Fey somehow make it work with their pragmatic natures and clever delivery, whether they are trying to escape in a slow-running motorboat in Central Park or pole dancing for a perverse D.A. As a perpetually shirtless security expert who was once Claire's client, Mark Wahlberg has a good time playing a parody of his screen image, while Taraji P. Henson has little to do but look perplexed as an inquisitive police detective. Ray Liotta and William Fichtner have small but pivotal roles, while James Franco, Mila Kunis, Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig show up in cameos. But it's all really about Carell and Fey who manage to do a lot in a genre that on the surface would seem ill-suited for them.",4,Carell and Fey Show Smart Rapport in a Domestic Comedy Disguised as a Chase Film,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,3213,"['Pairing', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'married', 'couple', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'inspired', 'casting', 'primarily', 'have', 'razor-sharp', 'improvisational', 'skills', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'respective', 'comedy', 'styles', '2010', 'comedy', 'vehicle', 'definitely', 'benefits', 'mutually', 'compatible', 'presence', 'Josh', 'Klausner', 'overly', 'formulaic', 'script', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'Night', 'Museum', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'direction', 'can', 'quite', 'measure', 'stars', 'talents', 'fact', 'Carell', 'Fey', 'shine', 'most', 'all-too-brief', 'closing', 'credits', 'when', 'series', 'bloopers', 'roll', 'where', 'take', 'previous', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'hilarious', 'line', 'reading', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'kinds', 'clips', 'line-o-rama', 'DVD', 'forThe', '40-Year-Old', 'VirginandKnocked', 'Up', 'one', 'producers', 'movie', 'will', 'include', 'much', 'more', 'co-stars', 'riffing', 'once', 'DVD', 'available.The', 'story', 'drab', 'domestic', 'existence', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'Foster', 'play', 'out', 'day', 'ordinary', 'couple', 'living', 'New', 'Jersey', 'suburbs', 'tax', 'accountant', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'Married', 'two', 'children', 'well-ordered', 'lives', 'include', 'weekly', 'date', 'nights', 'consist', 'eating', 'same', 'food', 'same', 'local', 'restaurant', 'Teaneck', 'Tavern', 'where', 'one', 'sense', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company', 'make', 'comic', 'routine', 'imagining', 'what', 'perceive', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'lives', 'diners', 'nearby', 'tables', 'However', 'once', 'find', 'out', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'getting', 'divorce', 'sheer', 'boredom', 'other', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'become', 'concerned', 'will', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'whim', 'Phil', 'take', 'Claire', 'trendy', 'Manhattan', 'seafood', 'restaurant', 'been', 'dying', 'try', 'When', 'begin', 'realize', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'table', 'Phil', 'impulsively', 'reservation', 'no-show', 'couple', 'turning', 'point', 'shenanigans', 'follow', 'couple', 'pretend', 'be', 'are', 'great', 'deal', 'hot', 'water.From', 'point', 'forward', 'movie', 'cross', 'Martin', ""Scorsese'sAfter"", 'Hours', 'Woody', ""Allen'sManhattan"", 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'number', 'high-priced', 'action', 'films', 'heavily', 'orchestrated', 'car', 'chases', 'acrobatic', 'gunplay', 'leitmotif', 'be', 'borrowed', 'heavily', 'Alfred', ""Hitchcock'sNorth"", 'Northwestin', 'innocent', 'couple', 'pursued', 'relentlessly', 'unseemly', 'thugs', 'convinced', 'are', 'carrying', 'important', 'flash', 'drive', 'containing', 'blackmail', 'information', 'However', 'predictable', 'plot', 'Carell', 'Fey', 'somehow', 'make', 'work', 'pragmatic', 'natures', 'clever', 'delivery', 'are', 'trying', 'escape', 'slow-running', 'motorboat', 'Central', 'Park', 'pole', 'dancing', 'perverse', 'D.A', 'perpetually', 'shirtless', 'security', 'expert', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'Claire', 'client', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'good', 'time', 'playing', 'parody', 'screen', 'image', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'little', 'do', 'look', 'perplexed', 'inquisitive', 'police', 'detective', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'have', 'small', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'James', 'Franco', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'show', 'up', 'cameos', 'really', 'Carell', 'Fey', 'who', 'manage', 'do', 'lot', 'genre', 'surface', 'would', 'seem', 'ill-suited']",N/A

Unfortunately, it only got worse. The dialog felt contrived and the plot was flat and uni-dimensional at best. It was rudely apparent that scenes had been stripped out, but it didn't matter the film moved along without them like some homage to the undead.Tina seemed out of her element. She usually provides a dynamic performance on SNL. However, one liner skits may be her forte, but feature films may not. Her performance gave that familiar feeling that you get when an actor just didn't have time to rehearse and instead gave a disaffected and flat reading of the cue cards; a familiar occurrence in comedy skits, but not conducive to suspending disbelief in features.The film makes a failed attempt to be something to all. It's not a chick flick, just not enough character development. It tries to be a family film, but references to ""penis blood"" and an overly long scene with Fey working a stripper's pole, leaves the kids behind. Remember, some things can never be unseen.The film is certainly a wasted effort by all and a very forgettable film.

The two are run down by the inertia of marriage, family, and kids.  They are quite possibly the WASPiest couple on Earth, and ennui rules their sad existences.  The only fun they have is date night, where they see other couples and make stories up about their fellow diners.  All that changes when they decide to take a chance one night by stealing another couple's reservation, a couple who just happen to be involved in an intricate plan of betrayal, prostitution, and blackmail.Aside from a very interesting scene that I'm calling a Siamese twin car chase, and the occasionally interesting cameo from Olivia Munn or comedian Bill Burr, this film delivers no surprises.  A few lame jokes, awkward old white people dancing scene, Tina Fey dragging unfunny SNL co-cast members into the film like a hangman's noose.  Other than casting, there isn't a single memorable aspect.  The script is Farmer's Almanac predictable, and the character development never really gives the viewer a reason to care.  I hoped they would get shot and the movie would get good.  Alas, it never happened.

You couldn't be more wrong. Tina Fey's obnoxious approach to comedy is usually right on the button, and Steve Carell (from the comedy perspective) can be hit or miss.  Hit - ""40-Year Old Virgin"" and ""Anchorman.""  Miss - ""Dan In Real Life"" and ""Get Smart.""This movie couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do. Should it be a suspense film, or should it be a comedy? Should it be a comedy/suspense film? Answer: None of the above. Date Night tried too hard to be funny with a storyline that was fighting to disallow comedy from the word ""Go."" The punchlines that forced their way into the dialogue from time to time seemed out of place and contrived. If you're going to have a comedy that involves suspense, maybe you should consider having some bumbling idiots as bad guys or, at the very least, characters with some sense of derivative humor to offset the seriousness of the film, which, in turn, would make this a flick for the comedy/suspense genre. The bad guys here were straight and unfunny.Steve and Tina had a couple of semi-amusing one-liners, but, for the most part, their characters were boring and underdeveloped in an already compromised film, and there was practically nothing they could do, given their highly-regarded comedic talents, to pull this movie from the dregs it was bound to drudge in from the start.Here's an idea: If you're going to make a comedy...make a comedy.

While the movie didn't quite hit the status of one of my favorite movies Shawn directed, ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" it was an adequate night out.  By the filled theater, mostly with the middle aged to older crowd, I am sure this movie will be a commercial success.  I personally don't know if it lived up to the hype but it did make me laugh out loud a few times.Phil (Steve Carell) and Clair (Tina Fey) Foster are your typical middle aged couple.  They have two kids, live in the suburbs and are caught up in the daily routine of keeping the house churning along.  Groceries, soccer, dentist appointments etc. fill every waking second outside of working two jobs.  What American couple doesn't work two jobs in our society today?  One of the first scenes has them debating whether to have sex or not.  When Clair pulls out her night guard, that just happened to remain connected to her mouth by a string of saliva, I died laughing and felt nauseous at the same time.The couple venture off to Manhattan one night in an effort to shake things up a little, and that is where things venture down a wrong path.  Not being able to get dinner reservations they take on another couples identity in order to snag a table.  Who hasn't raised their hand at one time or another when a name is called, even if it were not your own.  Unfortunately the couple they were pretending to be was in trouble with the mob and a few city officials.  The rest of their evening and well into the morning is spent being chased by two gun toting police that just happen to be working for the bad guys.Mark Wahlberg might have played my girlfriend's (and every other woman's) favorite role as the all knowing city dweller.  He just happened to help them out a few times and spent the entire movie walking around with his shirt off.  Yes he does look damn good but he intimated Mr. Foster and every other man in the theater watching most likely.  My girlfriend was unable to pull her gaze from the screen when he opened his apartment door half naked.  The rest of the story was a little shaky on substance, but it was put together more to garner a laugh than to stroke substantive thinking.Overall the movie is worth a few laughs with not much depth of story.  It can't even approach an all out great comedy like ""Old School"" or ""Hangover"" but it is humorous enough to be worth watching.  It is definitely geared to the older married crowd.  I think anyone under the age of 25 might not find all of the parental couple jokes quite as funny.

But watching them throw every mannerism they are famous for up against the wall in every scene in a desperate attempt to make something - anything! - stick is just tiring and boring.The script is the weakest link. It takes forever to get off the ground and has the characters making decisions that leave you scratching your head rather than laughing. I can go along with crazy ideas and panicked reactions - most action comedies are full of those. But theirs are contrived reactions that serve merely serve to keep the premise from unraveling. They aren't based in their human flaws and fears.The only scene that made me chuckle was when Fey and Carrell's sweet anxious innocent middle-class couple come across their mirror image, a coarse, hardscrabble pair of inner city criminals played by James Franco and Mila Kunis.

This is how the story goes: Phil and Claire Foster are a sensible, loving couple with two kids and a house in suburban New Jersey. The Fosters have their weekly ""date night"" -- an attempt at re-experiencing the spice of the dates of yesteryear, involving the same weekly night out at the local Teaneck Tavern. Their conversations quickly drift from barely-date talk to the same chore-chat they have at the dinner table at home. Exhausted from their jobs and kids, their dates rarely end in fore- or any other kind of play, let alone romance. After seeing two of their best friends -- another married couple with kids in suburban New Jersey -- split apart from living the same life they themselves lead, Phil and Claire begin to fear what may lie ahead: a state of bland indifference and eventual separation. In an attempt to take date night off auto-pilot, and hopefully inject a little spice into their lives, Phil decides a change of plans is in order: take Claire into Manhattan to the city's hottest new restaurant. The Fosters, however, don't have reservations. Hoping to be seated sometime before the clock strikes twelve, they steal a no-show couple's reservations. What could it hurt? Phil and Claire are now the Tripplehorns. The real Tripplehorns, however, it turns out, are a thieving couple who are being hunted down by a pair of corrupt cops for having stolen property from some very dangerous people. Forced on the run before they've even finished their risotto, Phil and Claire soon realize that their play-date-for-parents has gone awry, as they embark on a wild and dangerous series of crazy adventures to save their lives -- and their marriage.The cast led by Steve Carell (as Phil) & Tina Fey (as Claire) is great!

With kids that seem to get in to what is acceptable trouble, work that tires them both out and a home life that takes up their remaining time, things have begun to get a little stale. When another couple, their friends, decide to part ways because things have gotten too complacent, Phil decides that they need a special night out.Now the Fosters have always had a date night each week. But their date nights are predictable to say the least. They order the same food, talk the same talk, and make fun of other couples trying to figure out what their story is. But it's the same each and every time. This time will be different.They head to the city, to New York, and a trendy restaurant that Claire read about called Klaw. But being a trendy restaurant in New York means obnoxious staff and little chance you'll find a table on a Friday night. That is until Phil decides to take over for the Tripplehorns, a couple who don't claim their reservation. But by posing as the Tripplehorns they get more than they bargained for when a couple of tough talking guys ask to speak to them in private.The pair is looking for the real reservation couple and assumes the Foster's are them. Seeking a missing flash drive, they kidnap the pair at gunpoint and escort them to Central Park where Phil tells them they can find the flash drive in an attempt to play for time. Once there, they somehow make a successful escape and head straight to the police. The only problem is that while talking to the officer in charge, they see the duo that kidnapped them in the precinct wearing badges.With no one to turn to, their only hope is to find the real Tripplehorns and the missing flash drive. To do so they turn to one of Claire's ex-clients (she works in real estate), a detective Grant Holbrooke (Mark Wahlberg) whose appearance alone is enough to inspire jealousy in Phil.So by now you should get the picture. We have a couple far out of their league in the midst of the big city involved in something far bigger than they can handle. Well at least in the real world it would be more than they can handle. But this is the movies and of course their story turns towards humor rather than danger. Each and every step of the way something happens, they amazingly escape and at the same time bring out laughter while we watch.The only problem is that with these two talented actors in the lead, I kind of expected more laughs more often. Both have been involved with some of the funniest things I've seen in recent years but here, it just feels contrived most of the time. I'll give kudos where they are due, there are some truly funny scenes (especially involving the pair of them attempting to work a stripper's pole) but these are few and far between. Instead we seem to rely on the tried and true method of inserting car chases, crashes and gunplay to fill out the length of the film.I wouldn't say that this is a bad movie and for a rental I'm sure you'll get your money's worth. It does offer some funny moments. But the heart of the story involves, well, heart. It's about a couple that feels after all the years, with kids and responsibilities, that maybe they are missing something. Perhaps that old spark died out years ago and they want to make an attempt to find it again. The thing is that the spark was there all along and it never needed re-ignited. But that idea gets less on screen time than the car chases with perhaps one monologue from Carrell. It should have been front and center all along.For a predictable comedy with two great leads, you'll want to check this one out. Perhaps you won't want to add it to your collection, but as I said, its worth a rental.",3,NOT A GREAT DATE,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,3796,"['movie', 'DATE', 'NIGHT', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'Foster', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'are', 'typical', 'mundane', 'married', 'couple', 'New', 'Jersey', 'kids', 'seem', 'get', 'what', 'acceptable', 'trouble', 'work', 'home', 'life', 'up', 'remaining', 'time', 'things', 'have', 'begun', 'get', 'little', 'stale', 'When', 'couple', 'friends', 'decide', 'part', 'ways', 'things', 'have', 'gotten', 'too', 'complacent', 'Phil', 'need', 'special', 'night', 'Fosters', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'date', 'night', 'week', 'date', 'nights', 'are', 'predictable', 'say', 'least', 'order', 'same', 'food', 'talk', 'same', 'talk', 'make', 'fun', 'other', 'couples', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'different.They', 'head', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'trendy', 'restaurant', 'Claire', 'read', 'called', 'Klaw', 'being', 'trendy', 'restaurant', 'New', 'York', 'obnoxious', 'staff', 'little', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'find', 'table', 'Friday', 'night', 'Phil', 'take', 'over', 'Tripplehorns', 'couple', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'reservation', 'posing', 'Tripplehorns', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'couple', 'tough', 'talking', 'guys', 'ask', 'speak', 'private.The', 'pair', 'looking', 'real', 'reservation', 'couple', 'Foster', 'are', 'Seeking', 'missing', 'flash', 'drive', 'kidnap', 'pair', 'gunpoint', 'escort', 'Central', 'Park', 'where', 'Phil', 'can', 'find', 'flash', 'drive', 'attempt', 'play', 'time', 'Once', 'there', 'somehow', 'make', 'successful', 'escape', 'head', 'straight', 'police', 'only', 'problem', 'talking', 'officer', 'charge', 'see', 'duo', 'kidnapped', 'precinct', 'wearing', 'badges.With', 'one', 'turn', 'only', 'hope', 'find', 'real', 'Tripplehorns', 'missing', 'flash', 'drive', 'do', 'so', 'turn', 'one', 'Claire', 'ex-clients', 'real', 'estate', 'detective', 'Grant', 'Holbrooke', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'appearance', 'alone', 'enough', 'inspire', 'jealousy', 'Phil.So', 'now', 'should', 'get', 'picture', 'have', 'couple', 'far', 'league', 'midst', 'big', 'city', 'involved', 'something', 'far', 'bigger', 'can', 'handle', 'Well', 'least', 'real', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'can', 'handle', 'movies', 'course', 'story', 'towards', 'humor', 'rather', 'danger', 'step', 'way', 'something', 'happens', 'amazingly', 'escape', 'same', 'time', 'bring', 'out', 'laughter', 'watch.The', 'only', 'problem', 'two', 'talented', 'actors', 'lead', 'kind', 'expected', 'more', 'laughs', 'more', 'often', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'funniest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'here', 'just', 'contrived', 'most', 'time', ""'ll"", 'give', 'kudos', 'where', 'are', 'due', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'especially', 'involving', 'pair', 'attempting', 'work', 'stripper', 'pole', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Instead', 'seem', 'rely', 'tried', 'true', 'method', 'inserting', 'car', 'chases', 'crashes', 'gunplay', 'fill', 'out', 'length', 'film.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'rental', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'offer', 'funny', 'moments', 'heart', 'story', 'well', 'heart', 'couple', 'years', 'kids', 'responsibilities', 'maybe', 'are', 'missing', 'something', 'Perhaps', 'old', 'spark', 'died', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'want', 'make', 'attempt', 'find', 'again', 'thing', 'spark', 'was', 'there', 'all', 'along', 'never', 'needed', 're-ignited', 'idea', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'car', 'perhaps', 'one', 'monologue', 'Carrell', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'front', 'center', 'along.For', 'predictable', 'comedy', 'two', 'great', 'leads', ""'ll"", 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'Perhaps', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'add', 'collection', 'said', 'worth', 'rental']",N/A

Tagliaferro,"[0, 3]","While I didn't expect a masterpiece in the way of a plot, with a duo as dynamic as Steve Carell and Tina Fey, I hoped for a lot more from this movie.  Their characters, Phil and Claire Foster, who were a bored New Jersey couple, were good for a few laughs, but the good cop vs. bad cop/political cover-up adventure became equally boring before the end of this twosome's date night.With the exception of the confrontation with the real ""Tripplehorns,"" whose dinner reservations were stolen by the Fosters, a most unusual poll dance, and an unfortunate cab driver who literally was taken for a ride, the funnier parts of this movie ironically dealt with the couple's everyday lives.  Yes, there can be humor in discussing real life situations such as trying to sell a house or a Roth IRA.  And certainly a husband pretending to be interested in participating in his wife's book club is understandably amusing.But since most of the movie is wrapped up in a haphazardly thought out adventure taking place in one evening, the humor had to be strong enough to counteract a totally unrealistic plot.  And that's where our beloved characters fell short.  The Fosters' background is believable enough, but their acquaintances were too stereotypical and shallow.Why would a couple as unkempt as the ""Tripplehorns"" make a reservation at a posh and exclusive restaurant?  And why would dangerous detectives believe that someone would hide something as small as a flash drive in a boathouse in Central Park, where anyone can pick it up?  In this day and age, wouldn't experienced masterminds make copies of such incriminating evidence before hiding it?As with most typical comedies, however, we can forgive a lot for the sake of a few laughs.

Looking at New York City from the eyes of real people who adore its aura is best narrated in this comedy.  The New Jersey couple who dared to venture into Manhattan for a date-night as breakaway from their busy family life could have enjoyed equally glorious time between Philadelphia and Upper State New York, in the same time it takes to drive in the dingy restaurants, streets of Manhattan.  But, here where famous people live and for this professional couple it felt a special treat.The generosity and light spirit of the husband in his willing to reward his wife for being a loving partner turned that date-night into a intrusive adventure into the Attorney General's whorehouse paradise. It appearing that everyone enjoyed his date-night according to their individual budget.  The middle class couple arranged for a baby-sitter to their two kids and dreamed to get a table in a famous restaurant without advance reservation.  The influential law enforcement boss was hunkering in a whorehouse amidst a dozen of girls, yet willing to take more if his mood strikes.The date-night away from the heavy demands of raising two kids and attempting to keep spark in their marriage to avoid the inevitable trend of divorce, got the couple into few interesting heists involving total strangers.  The main theme evolves on the Attorney general exercising his influence on the few policeman to retrieve a flash drive that contains his sex scandals photos and was used to blackmail him.  Unfortunately the dating couples improvised few witty connections that led them to the infamous flash drive. From using a Kindle device to browse a flash drive amidst Manhattan's nightmarish traffic, to using high speed Internet to reverse telephone numbers with physical addresses, the professional couples accomplished more than a professional spying agency could do, in few hours, and no cost.The date-night turned into a great comical adventure and unexpectedly led the state-officials and sex maniacs to falling into the hands of the justice, which they were entrusted to protect.",5,Another New York legend.,1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,2236,"['Date', 'Night', 'tribute', 'New', 'York', 'Governor', 'Eliot', 'Spitzer', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'police', 'Commissioner', 'Bernard', 'Kerik', 'turning', 'government', 'jobs', 'whorehouse', 'paradise', 'Looking', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'eyes', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'adore', 'aura', 'best', 'narrated', 'comedy', 'New', 'Jersey', 'couple', 'who', 'dared', 'venture', 'Manhattan', 'date-night', 'breakaway', 'busy', 'family', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'equally', 'glorious', 'time', 'Philadelphia', 'Upper', 'State', 'New', 'York', 'same', 'time', 'drive', 'dingy', 'restaurants', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'here', 'where', 'famous', 'people', 'live', 'professional', 'couple', 'felt', 'special', 'treat.The', 'generosity', 'light', 'spirit', 'husband', 'willing', 'reward', 'wife', 'being', 'loving', 'partner', 'turned', 'date-night', 'intrusive', 'adventure', 'Attorney', 'General', 'whorehouse', 'paradise', 'appearing', 'everyone', 'enjoyed', 'date-night', 'according', 'individual', 'budget', 'middle', 'class', 'couple', 'arranged', 'baby-sitter', 'two', 'kids', 'dreamed', 'get', 'table', 'famous', 'restaurant', 'advance', 'reservation', 'influential', 'law', 'enforcement', 'boss', 'was', 'hunkering', 'whorehouse', 'dozen', 'girls', 'yet', 'willing', 'take', 'more', 'mood', 'strikes.The', 'date-night', 'away', 'heavy', 'demands', 'raising', 'two', 'kids', 'attempting', 'keep', 'spark', 'marriage', 'avoid', 'inevitable', 'trend', 'divorce', 'got', 'couple', 'few', 'interesting', 'heists', 'involving', 'total', 'strangers', 'main', 'theme', 'evolves', 'Attorney', 'general', 'exercising', 'influence', 'few', 'policeman', 'retrieve', 'flash', 'drive', 'sex', 'scandals', 'photos', 'was', 'used', 'blackmail', 'Unfortunately', 'dating', 'couples', 'improvised', 'few', 'witty', 'connections', 'led', 'infamous', 'flash', 'drive', 'using', 'Kindle', 'device', 'browse', 'flash', 'drive', 'amidst', 'Manhattan', 'nightmarish', 'traffic', 'using', 'high', 'speed', 'Internet', 'reverse', 'telephone', 'numbers', 'physical', 'addresses', 'professional', 'couples', 'accomplished', 'more', 'professional', 'spying', 'agency', 'could', 'do', 'few', 'hours', 'cost.The', 'date-night', 'turned', 'great', 'comical', 'adventure', 'unexpectedly', 'led', 'state-officials', 'sex', 'maniacs', 'falling', 'hands', 'justice', 'were', 'entrusted', 'protect']",N/A

With Tina Fey and Steve Carell I knew it had to be funny. While there were some funny moments, I was somewhat disappointed in the movie. Directed by Shawn Levy, this film had some laughs but often an underdeveloped plot.Phil and Claire Foster (Carell and Fey) have fallen into a funk with their marriage.  Same routines, same jobs, same chores, and even the same activities on their date night have done nothing to improve their relationship.  Finally, one night they decide to try something different and get themselves into a world of trouble.  The evening starts innocent enough; Phil wants to take her somewhere special in the city and they decide on Claw, an upscale seafood restaurant.  Problem is they haven't made reservations and the place is packed. Posing as the Tripplehorns they take a no-show reservation and start having a lovely dinner.  But then they are interrupted by two thugs who want a flashdrive back for their boss Joe Miletto (Ray Liotta).They run for their lives and try to go to the police, but discover the two thugs are also police as well.  With no one to turn to they decide to try to recover the flash drive themselves with a little help from an old client of Claire's, Holbrooke Grant (Mark Wahlberg).  Hilarity and car chases ensue and the Fosters must find a way to make it out of the city and back to their quiet home alive.  They devise several methods to get to this flashdrive including pole dancing and acting as uppity music critics.I'm always a big fan of Fey and Carell and I think they did the best they could with the script that was given to them.  They tried hard to make it funny and really had great chemistry together on the movie.  It just wasn't enough to make a cheesy script fantastic.  It seemed as if the movie was forcing laughs instead of just letting them come naturally.  Granted there were some very funny parts, they were just a bit far in between.The music in this movie was good.  There was variety and it fit well in the scenes.  I especially liked the ending song ""Your Love Is Lifting Me Higher.""  It's always a great song that expresses comfortable love.I'd probably watch this movie again.  It wouldn't be a go-to movie for me but something nice to watch on a rainy day when you want to see something comfortable and in the genre of romantic comedy.Review by M.

Unfortunetely, this film did not live up to the bar.  I'm not sure if the hype surrounding the two leads ruined it by setting my expectations to high, but I didn't laugh as much as I wanted to.  Despite it's flaws, the film wasn't a total wipeout.  Despite my hopes that their ""marriage"" would be more comedic, Steve Carell and Tina Fey do make a nice couple.  Mark Wahlberg actually had a costume person working for him on this film despite never wearing much of a costume (his girlfriend wore more than him in this film and that's saying something.)  That in itself is kind of funny.  Common and Jimmi Simpson made a nice pair of ultimately dirty cops and Taraji P. Henson did a good job trying to figure out what exactly was going on even though she was sure she had the answer on the tip of her tongue the whole time.  Naturally, I can buy Ray Liotta's mobster performance any day of the week so I feel he was underused here.  As for William Fichtner, I know for a fact he can easily play corrupt and nefairious characters...that talent wasn't seen here...he just didn't get a real chance to bring that out.

Granted I had high expectations given that Steve Carell and Tina Fey were the leads but it was just poorly written and poorly directed. The movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a romantic comedy or a crime farce and failed badly at both. Also, Carell and Fey, despite being very funny people had zero chemistry.Having said that one of the best parts of the movie were the supporting characters.  Mark Whalberg was excellent especially the parts regarding how he chose to expose himself.  James Franco and Mila Kunis were also very funny as the bickering sleazebags.

1301493,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG97B0,RMurray847,"[63, 85]","In order for a movie packed full of unlikely plot-developments and general silliness like DATE NIGHT,  a cast that's easy to love who have razor sharp comic timing and mastery of their tone is needed.  Fortunately, Steve Carrell and Tina Fey meet all three requirements, and thus, DATE NIGHT works on many levels.Carrell and Fey play a nearly middle aged married couple with kids.  They have a comfortable suburban life, and are still fond of each other, but they are also clearly just a bit worn out by life.  ""Date Nights"" for them consist of going to a local steak restaurant, with worn-out d&eacute;cor and no sense of romance whatsoever.  And in time-honored, clich&eacute;d tradition, they wonder if they are still in-love with the other...because they see their closest friends getting divorced.  I hate the way Hollywood likes to make us think that no long term marriage could possibly still be happy and fulfilling.  True, raising a family and nurturing a career and paying bills and time do take their toll...but mature couples embrace those things.  They don't shake their heads with regret over the wild and crazy times they may have missed.Anyway, I clearly digress.  One day, Carrell decides to shake things up just a bit, and invites his wife to go ""into the city"" to try out a hot new restaurant they've heard of.  Naturally, when they arrive, with no reservations, they are treated with withering disdain by the staff...but Carrell hangs in there, and when the name ""Tripplehorn"" is repeatedly called by the hostess to no avail, Carrell declares that he and his wife are the Tripplehorns and they are seated and begin to enjoy a lovely evening together.  Then they are approached by a couple of thuggish men, who escort them to the alley and begin to rough them up.  Because apparently the real Tripplehorns are engaged in blackmail, and they are being hunted by some bad men.  Thus, Carrell and Fey embark on a pretty wild and crazy Date Night...one in which many silly moments of physical comedy happen to them and equally as many unlikely plot twits.If you're going to see this movie for a coherent crime drama about two amateurs who foil a crime syndicate...you'll be disappointed.  But if, like 99.99% of the people attending, you're hoping for some good laughs and high-quality banter...you'll be mostly pleased.  Carrell & Fey deliver and then some.  Although these two performers have not really worked together before, they both share a past history with Chicago's famed Second City Improv group, and their comic sensibilities blend together quite nicely.  They can take some pretty mundane writing, and produce some remarkable laughs.  While I won't go so far as to say that Carrell and Fey (the actors) are clearly affectionate towards each other...you can certainly see the appreciation for each other's skill on their faces.  Carrell, in particular, gets a real twinkle of delight in his eyes when Fey delivers a great line.  There is nothing serious in their performances, but there is a warmth and camaraderie that are infectious.They are ably assisted by many good cameos, including a hilarious scene with James Franco and Mila Kunis and a recurring appearance from Mark Wahlberg, who plays a government security consultant (e.g. CIA) who has a lovely apartment and an apparent unwillingness to wear shirts.  While Wahlberg isn't really asked to do much except allow Fey and Carrell to react to him...he shows a humor about himself that is often missing in his persona.  The invaluable William Finctner shows up later, as does Ray Liotta, playing the character Ray Liotta always does.The movie also features an unlikely but very funny car chase.  Your enjoyment of it will greatly depend on your willingness to utterly suspend disbelief....but if you do, it's funny enough to cause a pain in your side.  Other moments of physical comedy fall flatter, even when Fey & Carrell are funny, the stuff they are asked to do sometimes isn't.  Again, in lesser hands (say, oh, Gerard Butler & Jennifer Aniston), this movie would be nearly intolerably shrill.  But in the end, it's a wonderful tribute to the skills of its two stars and while it's not a classic screwball comedy, it is still well worth your time.",4,"Tina Fey & Steve Carrell are excellent in this frantic, uneven comedy",1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,4236,"['order', 'movie', 'packed', 'full', 'unlikely', 'plot-developments', 'general', 'silliness', 'DATE', 'NIGHT', 'cast', 'easy', 'love', 'who', 'have', 'razor', 'sharp', 'comic', 'timing', 'mastery', 'tone', 'needed', 'Fortunately', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'meet', 'three', 'requirements', 'thus', 'DATE', 'NIGHT', 'many', 'levels.Carrell', 'Fey', 'play', 'nearly', 'middle', 'aged', 'married', 'couple', 'kids', 'have', 'comfortable', 'suburban', 'life', 'are', 'still', 'fond', 'other', 'are', 'also', 'clearly', 'just', 'bit', 'worn', 'out', 'life', 'Date', 'Nights', 'consist', 'going', 'local', 'steak', 'restaurant', 'worn-out', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'sense', 'romance', 'whatsoever', 'time-honored', 'clich', 'eacute', 'tradition', 'wonder', 'are', 'still', 'in-love', 'other', 'see', 'closest', 'friends', 'getting', 'divorced', 'hate', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'think', 'long', 'term', 'marriage', 'could', 'possibly', 'still', 'be', 'happy', 'fulfilling', 'True', 'raising', 'family', 'nurturing', 'career', 'paying', 'bills', 'time', 'do', 'take', 'toll', 'mature', 'couples', 'embrace', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'shake', 'heads', 'regret', 'wild', 'crazy', 'times', 'may', 'have', 'missed.Anyway', 'clearly', 'digress', 'One', 'day', 'Carrell', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'just', 'bit', 'wife', 'go', 'city', 'try', 'out', 'hot', 'new', 'restaurant', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Naturally', 'when', 'arrive', 'reservations', 'are', 'treated', 'withering', 'disdain', 'staff', 'Carrell', 'hangs', 'there', 'when', 'name', 'Tripplehorn', 'repeatedly', 'called', 'hostess', 'avail', 'Carrell', 'wife', 'are', 'Tripplehorns', 'are', 'seated', 'begin', 'enjoy', 'lovely', 'evening', 'together', 'Then', 'are', 'approached', 'couple', 'thuggish', 'men', 'who', 'escort', 'alley', 'begin', 'rough', 'up', 'apparently', 'real', 'Tripplehorns', 'are', 'engaged', 'blackmail', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'bad', 'men', 'Thus', 'Carrell', 'Fey', 'embark', 'pretty', 'wild', 'crazy', 'Date', 'Night', 'one', 'many', 'silly', 'moments', 'physical', 'comedy', 'happen', 'equally', 'many', 'unlikely', 'plot', 'twits.If', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'coherent', 'crime', 'drama', 'two', 'amateurs', 'who', 'foil', 'crime', 'syndicate', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', '99.99', '%', 'people', 'attending', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'good', 'laughs', 'high-quality', 'banter', ""'ll"", 'be', 'mostly', 'pleased', 'Carrell', 'Fey', 'deliver', 'then', 'two', 'performers', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'worked', 'together', 'before', 'share', 'past', 'history', 'Chicago', 'famed', 'Second', 'City', 'Improv', 'group', 'comic', 'sensibilities', 'blend', 'together', 'quite', 'nicely', 'can', 'take', 'pretty', 'mundane', 'writing', 'produce', 'remarkable', 'laughs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'Carrell', 'Fey', 'actors', 'are', 'clearly', 'affectionate', 'towards', 'other', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'appreciation', 'other', 'skill', 'Carrell', 'particular', 'real', 'twinkle', 'delight', 'eyes', 'when', 'Fey', 'great', 'line', 'nothing', 'serious', 'performances', 'warmth', 'camaraderie', 'are', 'infectious.They', 'are', 'ably', 'assisted', 'many', 'good', 'cameos', 'including', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'James', 'Franco', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'recurring', 'appearance', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'government', 'security', 'consultant', 'e.g', 'CIA', 'who', 'lovely', 'apartment', 'apparent', 'unwillingness', 'wear', 'shirts', 'Wahlberg', ""n't"", 'really', 'asked', 'do', 'much', 'allow', 'Fey', 'Carrell', 'react', 'humor', 'often', 'missing', 'persona', 'invaluable', 'William', 'Finctner', 'up', 'later', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'playing', 'character', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'always', 'does.The', 'movie', 'also', 'unlikely', 'very', 'funny', 'car', 'chase', 'enjoyment', 'will', 'greatly', 'depend', 'willingness', 'utterly', 'suspend', 'disbelief', '.but', 'do', 'funny', 'enough', 'cause', 'pain', 'side', 'Other', 'moments', 'physical', 'comedy', 'fall', 'flatter', 'even', 'when', 'Fey', 'Carrell', 'are', 'funny', 'stuff', 'are', 'asked', 'do', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'Again', 'lesser', 'hands', 'say', 'oh', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'intolerably', 'shrill', 'end', 'wonderful', 'tribute', 'skills', 'two', 'stars', 'not', 'classic', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'still', 'well', 'time']",N/A

Saul ""opinionated, yet  truthful, mu...","[0, 1]","""Date Night"" could have been an intelligent, insightful and provocative film but, instead, it took the easy way out by turning into a dumbed-down, ridiculous, slapstick movie.The premise of a married couple, happy on it's surface, yet having many anxieties is intringuing and accurate. As a married person, it is common to get into ruts and routines, take for granted what the other is doing, have a curiousity about what it's like on the other side, and grimmace about issues that persons outside your domesticated world couldn't understand. Most reasonable couples recognize the importance of finding time just for themselves' in order to work on the relationship. When ""Date Night"" focuses on this theme, it's a sharp movie that finds a wide audience that can relate to it.Steve Carrell and Tina Fey portray a long married and mild mannered couple, Phil and Claire, that have been engulfed by their everyday routines. They are hardly unhappy yet they yearn for some private time. When they go out to a toney dinner and assume another couple's name (just to steal a dinner reservation) they are mistaken for people that have an illict lifestyle and then the movie takes the route of ""mistaken identity"" and falls into a cliched, stereotypical formula.Carrell has charisma and is highly entertaining as the nerdy guy caught in an unusual situation. Tina Fey offers a lot less and is  overshadowed by Carrell's comedic talents.There are some fun cameos in the movie. Mark Wohlberg is very funny as a hunky, never-wears-a- shirt, former client of Fey, that offers emergency assistance and also extreme jealousy to Carrell's character. Wohlberg is so cool that he is too cool since he is ambivalent to the turmoil that Carrell and Fey bring towards him. James Franco and Milla Kunis are excellent as a ""trashy couple"" that , despite their looked down upon legal/moral status, are nonetheless envied for their romantic passion that Phil and Claire desire.There are many witty ""in the world of marriage"" type jokes that will get amusement from anybody that has been long married.The problem with this movie is that it takes a dumbed down direction. Instead of sticking to a witty, intelliegnt and insightful drama, it takes the easier path of moving the film along with silly car chases, harmless gun battles and other slapstick that is too inconsistent with the initial theme (and charm) of the movie.That sell out is what turns ""Date Night"" from an interesting commentory on seemingly happy marriages into a silly, forgettable farce.",2,This had promise but turned into really light fare,1299888000,"03 12, 2011",2011,2531,"['Date', 'Night', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'intelligent', 'insightful', 'provocative', 'film', 'instead', 'took', 'easy', 'way', 'turning', 'dumbed-down', 'ridiculous', 'slapstick', 'movie.The', 'premise', 'married', 'couple', 'happy', 'surface', 'yet', 'having', 'many', 'anxieties', 'intringuing', 'accurate', 'married', 'person', 'common', 'get', 'ruts', 'routines', 'take', 'granted', 'what', 'other', 'doing', 'have', 'curiousity', 'what', 'other', 'side', 'grimmace', 'issues', 'persons', 'domesticated', 'world', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Most', 'reasonable', 'couples', 'recognize', 'importance', 'finding', 'time', 'just', 'order', 'work', 'relationship', 'When', 'Date', 'Night', 'theme', 'sharp', 'movie', 'wide', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'it.Steve', 'Carrell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'portray', 'long', 'married', 'mild', 'mannered', 'couple', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'have', 'been', 'engulfed', 'everyday', 'routines', 'are', 'hardly', 'unhappy', 'yet', 'yearn', 'private', 'time', 'When', 'go', 'out', 'toney', 'dinner', 'assume', 'couple', 'name', 'just', 'steal', 'dinner', 'reservation', 'are', 'mistaken', 'people', 'have', 'illict', 'lifestyle', 'then', 'movie', 'route', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'cliched', 'stereotypical', 'formula.Carrell', 'charisma', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'caught', 'unusual', 'situation', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'lot', 'less', 'overshadowed', 'Carrell', 'comedic', 'are', 'fun', 'cameos', 'movie', 'Mark', 'Wohlberg', 'very', 'funny', 'hunky', 'never-wears-a-', 'shirt', 'former', 'client', 'Fey', 'emergency', 'assistance', 'also', 'extreme', 'jealousy', 'Carrell', 'character', 'Wohlberg', 'so', 'cool', 'too', 'cool', 'ambivalent', 'turmoil', 'Carrell', 'Fey', 'bring', 'towards', 'James', 'Franco', 'Milla', 'Kunis', 'are', 'excellent', 'trashy', 'couple', 'looked', 'legal/moral', 'status', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'envied', 'romantic', 'passion', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'are', 'many', 'witty', 'world', 'marriage', 'type', 'jokes', 'will', 'get', 'amusement', 'anybody', 'been', 'long', 'married.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'dumbed', 'down', 'direction', 'Instead', 'sticking', 'witty', 'intelliegnt', 'insightful', 'drama', 'easier', 'path', 'moving', 'film', 'silly', 'car', 'chases', 'harmless', 'gun', 'battles', 'other', 'slapstick', 'too', 'inconsistent', 'initial', 'theme', 'charm', 'movie.That', 'sell', 'out', 'what', 'Date', 'Night', 'interesting', 'commentory', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'marriages', 'silly', 'forgettable', 'farce']",N/A

1301511,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002ZG97B0,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[0, 3]","Movie - 4.5I'm a big fan of Steve Carell. Ever since his debut for me in Anchorman, I've really liked his improv schtick and love The Office so much because of him (and others, of course). When I watched the trailer for Date Night some months ago and saw that he was co-starring with Tina Fey (also one of the funnier women I've seen), I thought it was a match made in comedy heaven that two award-winning actors would be gracing an action-packed rom-com with their presence. Carell and Fey play a married couple with two kids, stressful jobs, and a very mundane life that allows them one date night per week that may, but usually doesn't, lead to bedroom fun. One night, they steal a reservation at a high-end restaurant, suffer a case of mistaken identity by two mob-employed policemen, and are on the run to settle things by night's end. With that said, Date Night is a goofy and over-the-top ridiculous film about marriage, the lackluster lifestyle it brings with it, and the desire to break out of said rut. I'm not married myself, nor do I think I ever want to be if anything from this film is even the least bit accurate about ""family life,"" but I appreciate the sentiment they tried to display through Carell and Fey. I suppose like any other part of life, when everything starts to become routine, stagnation kicks in and you eventually get bored. I feel sorry for couples who think they're happily married, but aren't courageous enough to realize the stresses, repetitions, and emotional shortcomings a marriage can bring. Not that this film comes off with some kind of anti-marriage theme, quite the contrary. I think it sends a message that you just have to keep things new and diverse, be it in a steady relationship, marriage, or whatever. Some things I really like in the film are the script, actor chemistry, and the fact that it's all just a little over 90 minutes (for the extended version, anyway), making for a fun, short, and very laughable romp thanks in part to a great cast of supporting characters, particularly Mark Wahlberg, William Fitchner, and J.B. Smoove.Video - 4.5The movie starts off a bit dull in terms of photography, or should I say rather plain. You get to see Carell and Fey, the lives they lead at work, the humdrum existence that is their marriage, and some fairly boring (though funny) instances of social engagement between themselves and the rest of society. Colors don't really stick out, but do provide a very real-world portrayal from their time in the restaurant to the various layouts and nik naks around the house. But when the movie gets into gear, things look especially great. Black levels are perfect from Carell's jacket all the way down to the night streets of Manhattan. All the little dirt marks, scuffs, and messed up hair do a wonderful job in terms of detail and never get lost, despite the action that ensues. Contrast does a fine job keeping lines, shadows, people, and objects separate from each other as well, with a great amount of balance between film grain and noise. One scene that really impressed me was the part where the crooked cops take them to Central Park. It's extremely dark outside and inside the dock house, but there was barely any noise to be seen. On the one downside, while the overall picture is excellent, a few shots around the beginning are a little softer than the rest of the film, but maybe it was to complement the literary transition? Anyway, this was an unexpected surprise to have such good picture quality for a movie that I really thought would just get the low-budget, cannon fodder treatment, but kudos to the DP, Dean Semler for some excellent work.Audio - 4.5Much like the picture, the audio was quite a surprise as well. Dialogue is clear and understandable from the center channel throughout, even during that chaotic car chase sequence with all the screaming and background noise. Directionality doesn't offer much at first, but when the adventure begins, things like gunshots, screeching tires, a SWAT helicopter, and running through the streets (on foot or in car) will make their presence known. The part that wowed me the most was the scene where they go to visit Mark Wahlberg's character for the first time. He has this high-tech Tony Stark kind of computer in his office with a holographic touch-based screen (like I said, the movie is over-the-top), that when he starts pushing buttons or clearing icons to the side, it beeps, bleeps, and creeps with an amazing amount of depth that's almost the same kind of feeling in Iron Man. Seriously? Again, it was totally unexpected. Separation of the dialogue, music, and sound effects also offer up a good deal of immersion. Chrisophe Beck's score mixed with various selections of record label songs really kept me into the movie and always struck just the right chord for the on-screen situations. High and low ends (like Walhberg's computer, or the gunshots from the crooked cops) are handled perfectly as well. The only factor stopping me from giving the audio a 5.0 is the amount of LFEs. While there are a decent amount of them in the form body thuds, club music, and vehicle noise, I think giving the film anything more would just be ludicrous. Great job by the sound crew and the people at Fox, though.Extras - n/aThis was just a rental, and I didn't have time to listen to the commentary or watch the special features, so I apologize for not being quite as thorough as I wanted. However, when I eventually buy the BD for my personal collection, I will take the time to watch/listen to the extras at that time, then update this portion of the review. In the meantime, I hope the movie, video, and audio sections will suffice.Overall - 4.5As much as I wanted to see this in theaters, I never got around to it. But thank goodness the Blu-ray looks and sounds excellent. Date Night is a movie that's very entertaining, and even a little encouraging to those who are married, but not quite having as much fun as they used to. Not that I'd recommend any couple just go out and try to evade the mob or something, but the film does make for funny escapist entertainment. If you like Steve Carell or Tina Fey, this is definitely one to recommend.",5,Date Night (Blu-ray),1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,6201,"['Movie', '4.5I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Ever',

However, this weekend they want something new and fresh for their ""date night"" that has become routine, so the couple go to a fancy New York restaurant, where they ""take somebody else's reservation"" on a whim. To their great surprise, the ""somebody else"" happens to have been involved with some strangers with a gun looking for something.""Date Night"" is an entertaining comedy about mistaken identity and middle-aged husband and wife. There are some action sequences including car chase, but what keeps the film afloat is the two leads Steve Carell and Tina Fey as Phil and Claire. Both players are charming and delightful, fleshing out their characters through amusing banter. ""Date Night"" keeps us entertained as long as they are on screen, and thankfully, they stay there for the most of the film.Sadly, the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast. The list itself is quite impressive, including James Franco, Ray Liotta, Mark Ruffalo, Kristen Wiig and Mark Wahlberg. Shawn Levy's (""The Pink Panther"" ""Night at the Museum"" and its sequel) perfunctory direction doesn't do the film any favor, as apparently he doesn't know what to do with the great supporting cast. You can spot many scenes that could have been much funnier - shirtless playboy by Mark Wahlberg, for example - but the film misses every chance to do so.Then it was very lucky for the filmmakers that they were able to have Steve Carell and Tina Fey. Their excellent performances as the funny and likable married couple raise the otherwise ordinary action comedy one notch higher, almost.",3,(3.5 STARS) Excellent Steve Carell and Tina Fey in the Otherwise Average Comedy,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,1664,"['Phil', 'Claire', 'Foster', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'many', 'years', 'peacefully', 'living', 'New', 'Jersey', 'two', 'kids', 'However', 'weekend', 'want', 'something', 'new', 'fresh', 'date', 'night', 'become', 'routine', 'couple', 'go', 'fancy', 'New', 'York', 'restaurant', 'where', 'take', 'somebody', 'else', 'reservation', 'whim', 'great', 'surprise', 'somebody', 'else', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'strangers', 'gun', 'looking', 'something', 'Date', 'Night', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'middle-aged', 'husband', 'wife', 'are', 'action', 'sequences', 'including', 'car', 'chase', 'what', 'film', 'afloat', 'two', 'leads', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'players', 'are', 'charming', 'delightful', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'amusing', 'banter', 'Date', 'Night', 'entertained', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'screen', 'thankfully', 'stay', 'there', 'most', 'film.Sadly', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'rest', 'cast', 'list', 'quite', 'impressive', 'including', 'James', 'Franco', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Night', 'Museum', 'sequel', 'perfunctory', 'direction', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'favor', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'can', 'spot', 'many', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'funnier', 'shirtless', 'playboy', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'example', 'film', 'chance', 'do', 'so.Then', 'was', 'very', 'lucky', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'able', 'have', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'excellent', 'performances', 'funny', 'likable', 'married', 'couple', 'raise', 'otherwise', 'ordinary', 'action', 'comedy', 'one', 'notch', 'higher', 'almost']",N/A

Their suburban life has settled into such a rut that even their personal time, as a couple, fits a regular schedule - their ""date night,"" away from the kids. The story really gets under way at a toney new restaurant, the kind with reservations made weeks in advance, where they show up on a whim. Using the name on someone else's reservation, they get a seat. Unfortunately, they picked the name of someone in big trouble with a mob boss, some crooked cops, and others you don't want mad at you.Fey and Carrell carry this through beautifully as naifs trying to claw their way out of the situation. Of course, it escalates as it goes along, with a few spectacularly funny moments along the way. They save the best for last, though, in a final faceoff with the bad guys.

1301518,AP3B615GM191G,B002ZG97B0,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[6, 8]","For probably the last 5-10 years, I haven't seen a good Hollywood comedy.  They all seem to be about gross-out scenes, teenage losers, or awkward sexual situations.  Fortunately, ""Date Night"" breaks that trend by combining two hilarious leads with a genuine plot that can be enjoyed on all levels.For a basic plot summary, this movie follows the exploits of Mr. and Mrs. Foster (Carell and Fey) who (on their one impulse move) steal a dinner reservation from another couple and get drawn into a blackmail plot that has them running all over town looking for a way out.In terms of comedy, ""Date Night"" hits on all cylinders, thriving on the unmistakable style of Carell.  As so often happens in the world of funnymen, Carell may be completely irrelevant a year or two from now, but currently he is golden.  If you like him on ""The Office"", you'll laugh at this effort as well.  Tina Fey also shines in a co-starring role, providing a more direct approach to laughs rather than Carell's subtly.What really sets this movie apart from others, though, is its heart.  This is a film that can be enjoyed at a deeper level than just laughs.  It touches on common themes like family, stagnating marriage, and trying to find that youthful excitement in life.  Besides the funny business, ""Date Night"" will make you both think and feel in equal proportions.Thus, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend it to all viewers, especially Carell junkies.  It will have you laughing one minute, and contemplating your life the next.",4,Good Story; Hilarious Carell/Fey,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,1526,"['probably', 'last', '5-10', 'years', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'seem', 'be', 'gross-out', 'scenes', 'teenage', 'losers', 'awkward', 'sexual', 'situations', 'Fortunately', 'Date', 'Night', 'trend', 'combining', 'two', 'hilarious', 'leads', 'genuine', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'levels.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'exploits', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Foster', 'Carell', 'Fey', 'who', 'one', 'impulse', 'move', 'steal', 'dinner', 'reservation', 'couple', 'get', 'drawn', 'blackmail', 'plot', 'running', 'town', 'looking', 'way', 'terms', 'comedy', 'Date', 'Night', 'hits', 'cylinders', 'thriving', 'unmistakable', 'style', 'Carell', 'so', 'often', 'world', 'funnymen', 'Carell', 'may', 'be', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'year', 'two', 'now', 'currently', 'golden', 'like', 'Office', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'effort', 'as', 'well', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'also', 'co-starring', 'role', 'providing', 'more', 'direct', 'approach', 'laughs', 'rather', 'Carell', 'subtly.What', 'really', 'movie', 'apart', 'others', 'heart', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'deeper', 'level', 'just', 'laughs', 'common', 'themes', 'family', 'stagnating', 'marriage', 'trying', 'find', 'youthful', 'excitement', 'life', 'funny', 'business', 'Date', 'Night', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'feel', 'equal', 'proportions.Thus', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'viewers', 'especially', 'Carell', 'junkies', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'one', 'minute', 'contemplating', 'life', 'next']",N/A
