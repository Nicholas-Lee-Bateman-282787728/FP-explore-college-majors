Writers seem to think that sad endings are the way to go but I'm over it,there are far too many of them with &#34;Gay themed movies&#34; and this one is just unnecessary! Being caught and being saved from doing what he did would have the same impact, with a little tweaking of later scenes,this movie, could have been a classic!

1672636,A2FL0EKQ2EQ9E6,B00FPVGWY2,"a viewer ""a viewer""","[1, 1]","This film was great.  I'm glad I did NOT pay attention to the negative reviews before buying this.  I always look at the reviews before buying a product.  Something made me buy this film.  One gets to see what being gay is like when you're not a prince charming, a jock or popular as many gay movies out there depict.  This film has as its two leads two young teenagers with whom the average gay person can identify with.  Yes, the ending is not what I expected.  No, it will not change my mind about the film.  I think its a great film and if you enjoy a good cry and are not ashamed to say that you enjoy it, this film will certainly affect you in that way.  Its not for cynical, analytical people who have to dissect everything and try to come up with explanations about this, than and the other thing.  Why can't people just enjoy a movie for what it is....entertainment, without having to tear everything to bits.  I loved this film and the chemistry between Tristan Barr (Mike) and Lucas Linehan (Will) was the best I HAVE EVER SEEN in any gay themed movie.(SPOILER ALERT BELOW!!)They are both so endearing that they tear your heart out.  One has to have a heart of stone not to be moved.  And the beautiful lines that flowed out of Director/Producer/Writer Lea Galea's word processor touch the heart as well...a prime example being when Will tells Mike:""I know it sounds silly but when I'm in bed at home I try to think of something nice before I fall asleep.  It used to be really hard for me.  But lately, I've been thinking of YOU, and what a beautiful person YOU are and how good You've been to me"".Here is a young man who masks his sensitivity beneath a tough exterior and what makes this line all the more touching is the fact that he sees Mike from the inside, not the outside as Mike is certainly not a ""pretty boy jock type"" which often grace most gay themed films.  This is what makes their chemistry super hot.Probably the three most beautiful scenes in the film are:  1)  The garage scene where Mike has set up a film projector and a make shift screen and he surprises a blindfolded Will, who has never been to a drive in movie.  There is no dialogue...only music in this sequence...and this speaks more than words ever could.  When Mike takes the blindfold off Will and Will sees what Mike has done he is tickled to pieces.  Will has never known much happiness in his life and this is probably the happiest he will ever be and his face radiates with love, wonder, innocence and, yes, a sad pathos as well to see what Mike has done for him.  Mike, in turn, delights in Will's happiness and it is clear that he loves this boy with all his heart and soul.  Mike's face radiates as well because he is happy that Will is happy.Scene number two is the dance scene at school.  Will leads Mike into a beautiful dance (Music by the great Pina Tuteri and the song ""Love to Love"") behind the stage curtain where no one can see them.  They look into each others eyes and convey with their eyes what words will never adequately express.  Just a sweet, innocent, pure declaration of their love.  (Who needs bedroom scenes filled with sex???)Scene number three is the final shot of Mike and Will together under the tree.  Right before this scene Will has had a confrontation with his abusive father and runs out of the house.  Mike finds him.  Will tells him to go home because he doesn't want him to get hurt by his father.  Mike tells Will that he is not leaving and that he loves him.  Will collapses crying into Mike's arms.Then, the next shot is them beneath the tree where both are physically and emotionally exhausted and Will whispers to Mike, ""I love you too.""  Then there is a medium long shot with Mike asleep hugging Will around his rib cage and Will, asleep too, his arms cradled around Mike's knees with both their heads leaning against each other.  Probably the most beautiful shot I have ever seen in a Romantic Film, gay or straight.I have watched this movie practically every night since I bought it in January and I never get tired of it.  This is the most perfectly cast gay themed film I have ever seen and as I said before, Linehan and Barr's haunting performances will stay with you forever.This is destined to become a classic and to my knowledge, Lee Galea, the Producer/Writer/Director, is working on a new film called ""The Neon Spectrum"".  I only hope he re teams Barr and Linehan in his new film and if its half as good as ""Monster Pies"", it will be incredible.",5,Great Film With Brilliant Performances by the Two Leads!,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,4494,"['film', 'was', 'great', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'NOT', 'pay', 'attention', 'negative', 'reviews', 'buying', 'always', 'look', 'reviews', 'buying', 'product', 'Something', 'made', 'buy', 'film', 'One', 'see', 'what', 'being', 'gay', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'prince', 'charming', 'jock', 'popular', 'many', 'gay', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'depict', 'film', 'two', 'leads', 'two', 'young', 'teenagers', 'whom', 'average', 'gay', 'person', 'can', 'identify', 'Yes', 'ending', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'No', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'mind', 'film', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'enjoy', 'good', 'cry', 'are', 'not', 'ashamed', 'say', 'enjoy', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'affect', 'way', 'not', 'cynical', 'analytical', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'dissect', 'everything', 'try', 'come', 'up', 'explanations', 'other', 'thing', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'people', 'just', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', '.entertainment', 'having', 'tear', 'everything', 'bits', 'loved', 'film', 'chemistry', 'Tristan', 'Barr', 'Mike', 'Lucas', 'Linehan', 'Will', 'was', 'best', 'HAVE', 'EVER', 'SEEN', 'gay', 'themed', 'movie', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'BELOW', 'are', 'so', 'endearing', 'tear', 'heart', 'One', 'have', 'heart', 'stone', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'beautiful', 'lines', 'flowed', 'Director/Producer/Writer', 'Lea', 'Galea', 'word', 'processor', 'heart', 'well', 'prime', 'example', 'being', 'when', 'Will', 'Mike', 'know', 'silly', 'when', ""'m"", 'bed', 'home', 'try', 'think', 'something', 'nice', 'fall', 'asleep', 'used', 'be', 'really', 'hard', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thinking', 'YOU', 'what', 'beautiful', 'person', 'YOU', 'are', 'how', 'good', ""'ve"", 'been', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'sensitivity', 'tough', 'exterior', 'what', 'line', 'more', 'touching', 'fact', 'inside', 'not', 'outside', 'Mike', 'certainly', 'not', 'pretty', 'boy', 'jock', 'type', 'often', 'grace', 'most', 'gay', 'themed', 'films', 'chemistry', 'super', 'hot.Probably', 'three', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', '1', 'garage', 'scene', 'where', 'Mike', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'projector', 'make', 'shift', 'screen', 'blindfolded', 'Will', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'drive', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'only', 'music', 'sequence', 'more', 'words', 'ever', 'could', 'When', 'Mike', 'blindfold', 'off', 'Will', 'Will', 'what', 'Mike', 'done', 'tickled', 'pieces', 'Will', 'never', 'known', 'much', 'happiness', 'life', 'probably', 'happiest', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'face', 'love', 'wonder', 'innocence', 'yes', 'sad', 'pathos', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'what', 'Mike', 'done', 'Mike', 'turn', 'delights', 'Will', 'happiness', 'clear', 'boy', 'heart', 'soul', 'Mike', 'face', 'as', 'well', 'happy', 'Will', 'happy.Scene', 'number', 'two', 'dance', 'scene', 'school', 'Will', 'Mike', 'beautiful', 'dance', 'Music', 'great', 'Pina', 'Tuteri', 'song', 'Love', 'Love', 'stage', 'curtain', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'look', 'others', 'eyes', 'convey', 'eyes', 'what', 'words', 'will', 'never', 'adequately', 'express', 'Just', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'pure', 'declaration', 'love', 'Who', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'filled', 'sex', 'Scene', 'number', 'three', 'final', 'shot', 'Mike', 'Will', 'together', 'tree', 'Right', 'scene', 'Will', 'had', 'confrontation', 'abusive', 'father', 'house', 'Mike', 'Will', 'go', 'home', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'hurt', 'father', 'Mike', 'tells', 'Will', 'not', 'leaving', 'Will', 'collapses', 'crying', 'Mike', 'arms.Then', 'next', 'shot', 'tree', 'where', 'are', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'exhausted', 'Will', 'whispers', 'Mike', 'love', 'too', 'Then', 'medium', 'long', 'shot', 'Mike', 'asleep', 'hugging', 'Will', 'rib', 'cage', 'Will', 'asleep', 'too', 'arms', 'cradled', 'Mike', 'knees', 'heads', 'leaning', 'other', 'Probably', 'most', 'beautiful', 'shot', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Romantic', 'Film', 'gay', 'straight.I', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'practically', 'night', 'bought', 'January', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'most', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'gay', 'themed', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'said', 'Linehan', 'Barr', 'haunting', 'performances', 'will', 'stay', 'forever.This', 'destined', 'become', 'classic', 'knowledge', 'Lee', 'Galea', 'Producer/Writer/Director', 'working', 'new', 'film', 'called', 'Neon', 'Spectrum', 'only', 'hope', 'teams', 'Barr', 'Linehan', 'new', 'film', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'Monster', 'Pies', 'will', 'be', 'incredible']",Monster Pies

Both boys have dysfunctional families and lots of emotional baggage, and having that in common is part of their initial attraction to each other, which turns into the first love for both of them.  They struggle with self-acceptance, and then argue about how &#8220;open&#8221; they can be with classmates and parents.This is a sweet indie film from Australia, which won &#8220;Best film&#8221; at the Melbourne Queer Film Festival.  It is an ambitious effort to show the obstacles faced by many gay teens, cleverly illustrated in the couple&#8217;s class project, a love story between two movie monsters who were alienated and shunned by others.  Unfortunately, the writer/director/producer/editor goes a bit overboard with the constant drama the two teens face alone, perhaps realistic for a decade or two ago, but it seems extreme in today&#8217;s internet-connected world of growing acceptance and resources for LGBT youth.  This carries through to the climatic ending, which was powerful but I also found a bit unrealistic.  On the plus side, the two young actors playing the couple were capable and seemed to have a good chemistry, despite their being surrounded by the overacting in supporting roles.Film is unrated, but would be a light R for partial male nudity.

And while the actors in the two lead roles are much more than adequate, few of the supporting players are convincing.

Everyone seems to want a happier denouement;  but I do not think it necessary for either Mr. Galea or Mr. Shakespeare to supply a sweet and sappy one for every tale.

I think the film's presentation is very clever indeed, i.e., layering or imbedding the Bard's great love theme/story (Romeo and Juliet) not only in one context, but in three. The first context is the mundane class reading, the second context is the student's attempt to add their own spin on the story, the third context for the two protagonists is THEIR personal &#34;Romeo/Juliet&#34; love story that happens within the second context--the student's 'spin' on the story.  For our protagonists, it becomes more than an assignment. It becomes, in fact, the reality of their lives--life imitating art--if you will, as they fall in love. That's kinda clever. The acting is sincere though a bit contrived and stagey, but that's high school, sometimes. All the key points in the Bard's telling are here as well. The budding of true love, the secretive forbidden/unconventional nature of the love; the raging parents and of course the death scene.

It is amateurishly acted, the script is weak, and the directing is naive and technically just barely competent.  Characters behave too often in ways that make no sense, that are poorly motivated or seemingly unmotivated altogether by anything that has happened before.  Purely accidental circumstances are thrown in to justify some critical events.  In short, the movie lacks narrative and psychological logic.  The plot is creaky and much of it unbelievable.  The whole kitchen sink, to use a clich&eacute;, of tired gay clich&eacute;s is thrown in:  dismal, broken homes, a cruel father, a distant father, one brain-damaged mother and another who is just batty.  The best friend with a crush on the lead character is a fat girl.  An older woman tries to seduce him in a video store and then, accusing him of assault, gets him fired.  Except for a kindly teacher, the rest of the women are nearly all stereotypes as well, and even the school teacher is at best a sort of caricature.  These clich&eacute;s, stereotypes, and cartoonish characterizations would be bad enough in any movie, but what is worse is that the film is about a half century behind in its view of gay life and of boys growing up discovering their sexuality.  It harks back to the era (spoiler alert) of &#34;People like that kill themselves, don't they?&#34;  If it were a rigorous or penetrating look at gay suicides among, say, bullied kids, it might be worth seeing.

Martin,"[4, 7]","Monster Pies is the story of two average, slightly nerdy guys in high school who fall in love and experience practically everything guys have experienced in gay movies since The Boys in the Band - in other words: too much. Too much for THIS movie, anyway. Robert Altman could have juggled this much melodrama, but this is a small movie that staggers under an unnecessarily heavy load.It's as if Lee Galea, the movie's writer-director-producer-executive producer-editor-etc, had a long list of things he felt compelled to include in his one shot at a feature-length gay movie, and most of them just get shoehorned into the story in places where they don't fit. The result is a painfully clumsy movie, in which the viewer gets slung around from one trauma to the next, with no sense of continuity or understanding of why all this stuff is happening. It's arbitrary, it's tiring, and it makes it very hard to care about these kids, since they live in some slightly skewed universe in which nothing makes sense.So... why did I give this wreck of a movie three stars?

In the mid-1980's, our beloved Vito Russo produced ""The Celluloid Closet"" - a history of the way in which Gay men and Lesbians had been depicted in film until that point in time.  It was a thorough, brilliant history that made its point - gay and lesbian characters never survived the end of a film.  Those of us who were young gay activists at the time vowed to change that - and over the next 15 years, AIDS notwithstanding, we started to see really beautiful films, depicting Lesbians and Gay men in a different way.  (Desert Hearts; Maurice).  So why are we still making films in which young gay men - fortunate enough to have found love in each other - commit suicide?  I'm not suggesting it isn't a serious problem - still.  But this is not the type of film which young gay men or lesbians should see.  We need positive outcomes.  This film is anachronistic.  It belongs to a period 30 years ago.  Or are we returning to that cinematic place again (Brokeback Mountain).  I'm not interested in going back to that time.

The chemistry between the two leads very believable, and the life situations that they are growing up in rings true.More than a gay story, I found this film to be a story of alienation. Both the characters are alienated in their school environment, lack supportive adult figures in their lives, and are left to their own devices to fend for themselves. And, to boot, they are young teenagers with little knowledge of the world and skills to make their way through all the hurdles they face.It's been said many times that teenage love is the most intense of all loves. I agree. Without any of the filters that people have because of dealing with loves that did not work out, a first love is faced head-on and all the emotions come to play.The pacing of the film is good as well. One thing leads to another and another, and while there are several scenes that appear to be random, life is a lot like that as well. Who knows what's going to come up tomorrow, or even today, sometimes?I read somewhere that hetrosexual relationships involve meeting &#34;the other&#34; in the relationship, while in homosexual ones, you meet &#34;yourself&#34;. An interesting way to look at things.
