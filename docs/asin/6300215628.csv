217319,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,6300215628,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[45, 46]","'Houseboat' is a throwback to the kind of sweet, happy comedies Cary Grant did in the late '40s-early '50s, and it foreshadows the domestic comedies James Stewart and Henry Fonda would do in the sixties. Granted, there is more romance (and with Sophia Loren as the objection of affection, Cary has it all OVER Jimmy and Hank!) but ultimately, it scores as a terrific family movie, as Loren, playing an inept but adorable housekeeper/nanny, wins the affection of widower Grant's kids, and awakens in him a more complete love than he was experiencing with his society girlfriend (played effectively by the beautiful Martha Hyer).Living in a rundown houseboat to save on expenses, Grant and family lives had become a boring routine, until the arrival of Hurricane Loren, with her Italian philosophy, her singing, and her unmistakable femininity and sex appeal (which introduces oldest son Paul Peterson to the joys of puberty, and to daughter Mimi Gibson and younger son Charles Herbert a mother-figure they both needed). Grant is at first oblivious to her charms, but she is hard to ignore for long! The question then becomes, when will Cary 'wake up', and realize everything he needs is right on the houseboat?Filmed after Grant and Loren's whirlwind affair during the filming of 'The Pride and the Passion', the film was a bittersweet experience for both stars, particularly shooting the wedding scene, as Grant still desperately wanted to marry Loren, but she had already decided to remain with longtime love Carlo Ponti. Viewers aware of the 'behind-the-scenes' story will appreciate the performances of the two leads even more!After you watch 'Houseboat', catch the flipside of this story in Grant's later 'Father Goose', as a drunken reprobate with a boat who must deal with governess Leslie Caron and her charges!

As a long time fan of Sophia Loren (what's not to like?), I picked up a copy of ""Houseboat"" and sat down to watch it with my wife and teen daughter. To our pleasant surprise, the film tells a story that still feels relevant in many ways.The story starts with Cary Grant, a recent widower, demanding custody of his three young children. He is a working man, in Washington D.C., and he drags the kids there against their wishes. They are mouthy, funny, and painfully sad. They would prefer staying with Aunt Carolyn, Grant's sister-in-law, on sprawling property far from D.C. Carolyn has always had a secret love for Grant, and she dreams of stepping in as the new wife and step-mother. Tensions rise when young and beautiful Sophia Loren appears on the scene. She is visiting America with her famous Italian father, a symphony conductor, and she wants to be free of his overbearing ways. When she runs into Grant's youngest son, she relates to his daddy-troubles and forms a quick bond that eventually lands her in the role of nanny to Grant's children.""Houseboat"" moves from humor to romance, and certain elements share similarities with ""The Sound of Music."" The overbearing father who hires the adorable nanny, who then runs off when she realizes her feelings for the man, but comes back because of the children. In this case, the children are less polished and polite, and this creates some believable conflicts for all concerned.

Imagine seeing Cary Grant and Sophia Loren dancing to a Sam Cooke love song on a screen the size of a football field. The wardrobe for the movie is stunning.

The explanation Cary Grant gives as a parent about death, and the kids dialogue and behavior rang true.  The kids behaved like any children would when one parent dies, and an absentee parent appears to take them from the safe world of their grandparents.  The kids were terrific in their roles.

Do you want to laugh, see gorgeous outfits, hear Loren sing, or root for the under[over]dog? Would you like a romantic comedy that teaches lessons in responsibility for children and parents? Move right in to HOUSEBOAT.I am always amazed when I see a film with a plot that casts Sophia Loren as the overlooked lover vying for a man's affection. (IT STARTED IN NAPLES;THE MILLIONAIRESS). But the notion of seeing what isn't in the eye of the beholder draws you to each film as you impatiently await the leading man to ""discover"" her.Cinzia Zaccardi (Loren) is the wealthy daughter of orchestra conductor Arturo Zaccardi (Eduard Ciannelli). As such, she is lavished in opulent dwellings and dinners with international nobles. What's missing from this overprotected woman's life is a MAN.Tom Winters (Grant) is a diplomat who neglected his parental responsibilities for the sake of his career. After his wife dies he gets the urge to do the right thing. The problem is, he is evidently clueless about what that is. He quickly learns that raising children is a joint responsibility. Though he hires an unlikely nanny, he feels the logical matrimonial choice is a woman who helped care for his three children before he came on the scene. His current nanny, who neither cooks nor cleans well, is good at eventually obtaining whatever she wants. After all, she's the spoiled runaway daughter of Arturo, the orchestra conductor.Despite the too-often sung bing-bang-bong song, HOUSEBOAT is a repeat-watch movie. My only problem is that I've seen it so many times on VHS that I would only purchase it used on DVD at a heavily discounted price just to complete my collection. (Update 9/29/06: I bought the DVD.)

The 50s was a time of sophistication and pure charm for Cary and Sophia Loren was every thirteen year old boys fantasy.The story is okay in that you know it will end with Cary and Sophia in each other's arms and everybody happy. But that's what a romantic comedy is and if you enjoy romantic comedies you will not be disappointed. Cary is taking on the responsibility of raising his three children alone on a houseboat and Sophia, running away from her famous orchestra conductor father, is the maid. The Maid! Can imagine Sophia as your maid? Or anybody's maid?  Through kid problems, arguments, boyfriends, ups and downs, and country club dances it all ends well. It is the two stars that are the attraction here certainly, but wait; there's more. The film would remain a 3 star middle of the road film if it were not for the nice comedic bit by Harry Guardino and a great score. The score is not on a par with Doctor Zhivago by any means but it fits the film nicely and the lead song by Sam Cooke - Almost In Your Arms - is terrific.

217426,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6300215628,Simon Davis,"[3, 4]","This charming little domestic comedy which really can be seen as a forerunner to the situation comedies of the 1960's, is given its memorable quality by the unexpectedly wonderful teaming of screen legends Cary Grant and Sophia Loren. By 1958 Grant was just entering the final period of his legendary career that would see him retire forever from movie making in 1966 with his debonair image still intact after almost four decades of continuous film work. Sophia Loren at this time was still largely considered an exotic recent import to Hollywood from Europe and had just completed a series of Hollywood efforts that teamed her with the likes of John Wayne, Alan Ladd and William Holden. The pair had teamed two years previously in the epic ""The Pride and the Passion"", also starring Frank Sinatra, however it was in this funny, and at times quite touching family story that their real chemistry on screen was properly displayed. Sophia Loren had probably her most successful Hollywood film up to this time with ""Houseboat"", and the ageless Cary Grant was in the middle of his highly successful collaborations in a series of glossy thrillers with director Alfred Hitchcock which certainly helped the box office of this very different type of story. Despite their different screen personas Grant and Loren are a delight together on screen when dealing with diverse situations involving three unruly children and an oversized decaying houseboat which almost becomes a character in itself in the story and is the main setting for the comic situations that arise.Cary Grant plays Tom Winters a debonair Washington business man used to the single life with lots of travel after his marriage breakup. When his former wife is killed in a car accident Tom suddenly finds himself gaining custody of their three children that had formerly been under the care of his former sister in law Carolyn (Martha Hyer). Taking the children away when his wife's family try to keep hold of the children Tom has a dilemma about where his new little family are to live and he finds that his bachelor quarters in Washington are no substitute for a real home. The children at first dont like him and want to be back with Aunt Carolyn and when youngest son Robert (Charles Herbert), runs away he is eventually brought home by beautiful Cinzia Zaccardi (Sophia Loren), who is also in the process of running away from her domineering father Arthuro Zaccardi (Eduardo Ciannelli ), who is a famous orchestra conductor. Because she has a great rapport with the children and they seem to instantly like her Tom offers the supposedly homeless Cinzia a job as combined maid, cook and cleaner for the family. Tom sets out to find a new home and comes across a dilapidated old houseboat which he thinks could be turned into the ideal family home. His idea of domestic bliss however is short lived when he finds out that not only can Cinzia not cook, do laundry or clean house, but that he is also falling in love with her. This creates a further complication for Tom in that he is developing a romance with Carolyn and she and her friends look down unkindly on Tom's having the beautiful Italian woman around the houseboat. After eldest son David (Paul Peterson), almost drowns in an over turned small boat and Carolyn and her friends attempt to embarrass Cinzia just prior to a Fourth of July party at the neighbouring Country Club, Tom realises where his real future lies and proposes marriage. However at this eleventh hour the children have a bad reaction to the lady they have loved over the last few months fearing that Cinzia is trying to take their dead mother's place and even as the wedding is starting on the top deck of the houseboat the children refuse to attend the ceremony. However all such stories have a happy ending and before the preacher can declare Tom and Cinzia man and wife the three children going through a rapid change of heart appear fully dressed behind the couple and Robert even ends up serenading the couple on his harmonica.Oddly enough I find a lot of similiarities between the general story of ""Houseboat"", and that of the more famous ""The Sound of Music"", in that a nanny comes into a disfunctional family and not only reunites its members but marries the head of the house. Sophia Loren although widely praised in her initial Hollywood efforts despite their lack of box office success, really began showing her potential in this effort where she was required to be more than decorative and show plenty of cleavage. She displays a fine comic style and she works very well with Cary Grant's laid back and totally charming acting delivery. She has many pleasing moments such as when she accidently (on purpose), sprays Cary Grant with paint during the houseboat's renovation and her love/hate scenes with him sparkle brightly enough even in the more unlikely moments. Cary Grant had this type of ""charming man of the world suddenly thrown into a dilemma type"" of character down pat by 1958 and he does very well as the comfortable bachelor suddenly having to deal with three children, a leaky houseboat, and a very beautiful Italian maid who can't cook or keep house. The three children in the story are what would be called ""typical sitcom children"", during the next decade but they are pleasing in their performances as well and at times have a maturity about their acting especially in the scenes when they reject Cinzia near the conclusion for supposedly attempting to take the place of their own mother. Paul Peterson as eldest son David would end up winning fame of his own as the son on the long running ""The Donna Reed Show"", which began it's network run the same year that ""Houseboat"", was released. The whole film certainly has the feel of a situation comedy about it and it constantly amazes me that the basic premise of this story in ""Houseboat"", was never used for an ongoing comedy series during the 1960's when this type of story was commonplace. Certainly Paramount regarded this vehicle as one of their bigger efforts for 1958 filming it in glorious Vista Vision and giving it glowing colour photography that gives the story an extremely lush look and feel. The beautiful renovated houseboat of the title seems to simply rise out of its earlier decaying, undesirable state and is something which only Hollywood in the 1950's could have thought up as the ""central character"", of a story such as this.  Veteran clothes designer Edith Head, long a Paramount legend with her incredible clothes designs over forty years for all of the Paramount stars also excels in her designs here and Sophia Loren really came into her own in the glamour stakes with the lavish and highly flattering clothes made for her by Edith Head in this picture.Good nostalgic fun from a simpler time is how best to describe ""Houseboat"". Not the funniest comedy from the 1950's for sure but it's highly enjoyable on a different level as a sort of time capsule for how Hollywood used to make comedies. Seeing Cary Grant and Sophia Loren together in one of their only two movie teamings is also a special treat and they really display what old Hollywood star power was all about. Happily ""Houseboat"", has been given a really beautiful treatment for it's release onto DVD and I highly recommend this charming little domestic comedy for all lovers of older style family movies where all members of the family learn from their experiences and develop a greater love for each other in the process.

This plays out as a predictable romantic comedy but great fun anyway. No heavy plot here.  As Grants housekeeper, Loren helps Grant to change his priorities, be less of a jerk,  and bond with his children.  This takes place on a leaky houseboat that sometimes breaks loose and floats down river.  Grants dry humor and wit is great fun to watch.  Loren is the Italian beauty (thought she was ugly when I was a child)that falls in love with Grant and brings the family together.",4,Houseboat,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,585,"['movie', 'real', 'delight', 'better', 'remembered', 'child', 'priorities', 'were', 'different', 'out', 'predictable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'great', 'fun', 'anyway', 'No', 'heavy', 'plot', 'here', 'Grants', 'housekeeper', 'Loren', 'Grant', 'change', 'priorities', 'be', 'less', 'jerk', 'bond', 'children', 'place', 'leaky', 'houseboat', 'sometimes', 'breaks', 'loose', 'floats', 'down', 'river', 'Grants', 'dry', 'humor', 'wit', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'Loren', 'Italian', 'beauty', 'thought', 'was', 'ugly', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'love', 'Grant', 'family', 'together']",Houseboat VHS

He progresses throughout the movie in a nuanced manner.They both have great chemistry!Mimi Gibson, Paul Petersen (of Mouseketeer and Donna Reed fame) andCharles Herbert all put in great performances as the children.There is even a minor supporting roles by Murray Hamilton as Grant's cheeky friend and Loren's father's manager, played by the very comic Werner Klemperer (Col. Klink). And, Harry Guardino who plays the ethnic Italian almost suiter, Angelo Donatello, was nominated for Golden Globe. The picture was nominated for two Academy's - Best Original Song (""Almost in Your Arms"") and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay. The movie and Grant did win two Golden Laurel Awards for Top Comedy and Top Male Comedy Performance.Mel Shavelson, who did a lot of romantic pictures like ""April in Paris"" and ""Yours, Mine and Ours"", did a great job pooling the acting team together in an innocent comedy that works the way they should - and that is not easy.Loren get's Americanized while she teaches Grant to grow up.

The colors in this film are fantastic so rich.Fresh widower with three kids in post wwii Washington D.C. runs into free spirited rich runaway whose father is a famous conductor for the symphony . She is tired of being dragged from town to town without ever getting to live a little . Cary Grant's seven year old runs off the same night and she ends up taking him home. She is an instant success with the kids and Cary thinks she's a flung off almost G.I. bride, she winks and says the fancy clothes came from her father , the truth yet an implied lie. The sister in law had been taking care of the kids and it was time he stepped up to the plate and started taking care of them. He ends up hiring Sophia to help with the house,he just jumped to the assumption that she is poor because her dress got dirty when she went out the window to the boat to ""row"" away. The problem is the house that he  was supposed to live in is being moved to the lot that day and well it gets hit by a train right in front of them while the trailer it was on was parked on the tracks. The driver got sidetracked looking at Sophia's legs. Now they are on a temporary Houseboat owned by the trailer driver a fellow italian and hound dog by nature. He keeps trying to date her the whole movie. She knows how to handle him .The visuals in here are fantastic. Sophia is sexy, Cary's suave, and portrays the overwhelmed dad well. Slowly he becomes enchanted with Sophias' open ways and starts to have feelings for her .  Troubles ahead in the form of the  very blonde and beautiful sister in law . She is socially acceptable to the richer echelons the family comes from and  has filed for Divorce on her cheating husband. She has had a crush on Cary since before her sister had married him. She's jealous and  disapproving of Sophia and always cutting at her .  Sophia can hold her own .
