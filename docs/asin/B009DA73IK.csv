1595232,AYG1U47VFZ165,B009DA73IK,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 2]","You know it: there's been a rash of found footage films that's been going on solidly for about a decade now.  I suppose each of them has something relevant to add to the phenomenon, but, at some point, I think it's increasingly difficult to find greater value in continuing a `found footage' project unless it posits to bring something fresh to the scene.  That's not an easy sell, mind you; in fact, I'd suspect that those kinds of projects are few and far between.  Still, without bringing something original to the format, is this truly a tale worth being told in this way (i.e. merely being a found footage motion picture)?With REEL EVIL, the results are a bit conflicted.(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Budding documentary filmmakers Kennedy (played by the fetching Jessica Morris), Cory (Kaiwi Lyman), and James (Jeffrey Adler) are hoping to get their big break in Hollywood when they respond to an advertisement seeking a film crew to shoot an official behind-the-scenes short for a studio horror film.  As luck would have it, they find more than they bargained for: the movie takes place inside a former psychiatric hospital - complete with its own sordid past - where they soon realize they can wander off and capture footage for their own project.  However, before the night is over, they're bound to unlock more secrets as they find themselves trapped in a never-ending maze ... and they're not alone.Yes - just to clarify - this is (yet) another found footage film, but I'll briefly try to explain why it, perhaps, shouldn't have been.See, the basic format of the found footage film builds itself around certain expectations for the delivery.  For example, `found footage' means just that - the footage is intended to be a mostly raw presentation of what took place or what happened to the central characters.  Furthermore, as the footage is intended to be presented in its bare bones format, there should be little if any evidence of post-production tinkering of any fashion because that - by definition - tends to interrupt the narrative flow of the `found' story.REEL EVIL, to its detriment, kinda/sorta veers off from the traditional `found footage' sub-genre of horror in several ways.  First, the story is cobbled together by several cameras - a few of which were independent from control of the main characters and, thusly, wouldn't have been part of the `found footage' phenomenon being captured by the crew.  The most prominent example of this is a scene captured by two minor characters on a cell phone; because this footage wasn't part of the end product being filmed by Kennedy, Cory, and James, it ends up reminding the audience that what it's watching IS a motion picture, not a found footage reel, directly.  This causes a break in the natural flow of the story (at least it did for me), producing the effect to pull me out of the story.  Even worse, however, was the fact that either scribe Shane Bitterling or director Danny Draven decided that a music soundtrack was required as part of the REEL EVIL experience; see, `found footage' films don't use soundtracks because, as I think I've tried to be clear, they are compilations of `found footage,' and they necessarily wouldn't have a pounding orchestral accompaniment.To the film's credit, there are several very good ideas and several very good scares at play here, so many that I think the film would've been better served to trash the whole `found footage' experience entirely and simply go with a traditional horror film.  In fact, some of the experiences might've worked better that way, and I think it would've opened up the story to more opportunity for some creative storytelling.  As it is, there are some legitimate `creeps' in there.  It would've been served up with more had Draven and company embraced a different format.REEL EVIL is produced by Full Moon Entertainment, and DVD distribution appears to have been handled by their subsidiary, Full Moon Direct.  As for the technical aspects, I'll have to admit that I find it increasingly difficult to appraise `found footage' films.  First, the sound is never the best (as that's part of the total package); second, the image is herky-jerky and sometimes hard to discern (as that's also part of the package); and, lastly, it's deliberately not all meant to look as prim and proper as regular theatrical releases.  So I'll leave it at this: I think it looks and sounds exactly as well as the director and producer wanted.  For disc enthusiasts, there's a wealth of special features, including a commentary track, some behind-the-scenes production shorts, a blooper reel, music video, and an assortment of trailers for related releases.  They certainly didn't skimp on the side dishes, and I'm sure there's something for everyone who's interested.2 and one-half stars.  RECOMMENDED.  It's a perfectly average experience that coulda/shoulda/woulda been better.  As scares go, it's a harmless way to spend 77 minutes.  Despite the fact that REEL EVIL tries to combine one genre with a sub-genre in it, there are plenty of sparks of inspiration in it, enough that I would've strongly recommended - were I in pre-production - to chuck the whole `found footage' aspect and focused on a traditional horror film.  While I can't predict the outcome, I'd honestly think it may've been better received by audiences.  The story meanders a bit in the second half when it's reduced to  little more than the lost crew trying to find their way out of the haunted hospital, and that needed tightening up in order to produce a cleaner production.  Otherwise, it delivers exactly what it promises: a found-footage flick with ghosts aplenty ... but it could've been something more.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Full Moon Features provided me with an advance DVD screener of REEL EVIL by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,REEL EVIL Is A Real Puzzle,1358208000,"01 15,

Now, I am NOT one of those critical snobs who will poo poo a movie because its thematic content is not wholly original. If that was a problem for me, then most of my slasher A list films, nevermind B list, would not have been made. Actually, that would be true of any subgenre, slasher or otherwise. So I am VERY grateful to those many movies that do not strive for originality but effectiveness because, thanks to them, I have stuff to watch.I guess what makes it hard to overlook the derivative quality here is the main characters. The secondary characters, those who our protags were going to record for their &#34;making of...&#34; documentary, were obnoxious on purpose and as such, funny and a breath of fresh air from the &#34;Controlling Dumb Beotch, with the Dumb and Dumber follower&#34; trio that comprised our protags. Seriously, this not being my first rodeo, if I were in a situation like this, with anyone who acted like that, I would be the first one to satisfy their death wish, waaay before the ghost, demon, serial killer, et al, would get a chance to. You are NOT going to take me down with your dumb butt. That being said... I don't normally criticize the &#34;stupid decisions&#34; made by many of our protags in these movies- and it irks me when others do- because, duh, if they didn't make those mistakes then there would be no movie! But these guys were just too annoying. So much so, I was glad when Dr. Evil came to visit. Except they were biref visitations and as such, didn't comprise much or enough of the film. The visuals, the horror effects, were fine actually. But having seen the aforementioned same but first movies, it wasn't enough to excite me. Pretty much a forgettable experience.

1595237,ANL1LDXUTATCS,B009DA73IK,Manuel A. Saez,"[8, 10]","I love found footage films, specifically because the acting is so raw and realistic, and this one is no exception. Everyone (except the female playing the actress) was authentic, solid in their range, and did a great job of drawing you into the story, so the movie gets two stars for that. Unfortunately, that's where the positives of this film end. The plot has been done before, (and much better, might I add, by 'Grave Encounters'), and the special effects are atrocious. All of the apparitions looked to have been made using Microsoft Paint and then placed into the film with no regards to realism, or how it would appear to the average person. Considering that movies of this nature rely heavily on how well the SFX is implemented, I must say that I was very disappointed by what I saw. Lastly, there are too many instances where absolutely nothing happens, or the actors are walking around in (literal) circles, and this becomes tedious really fast.The worst part of the film, however, is the gratuitous portrayal of breasts that seem to have been added to appease a mentality limited male audience. I counted 3 pairs of breasts, none integral to the story, and I actually rolled my eyes in annoyance at how the film-makers did not even attempt to hide the fact that they were sophomoric males whom have probably never seen a real naked female in their lives.It's sad, really; the talent is obviously there, the story (albeit cliched) held my interest and the real-life location was creepy as hell.

This one incorporates the found footage genre. In this production a film crew is hired to film a documentary on behind the scenes footage of a movie filmed at said asylum. What this gimmick does is to allow decent lighting as the main crew had set them up. This gives us a more professional looking found footage film.Kennedy(Jessica Morris)leads this group of daring film makers as they explore the abandoned establishment. You see occasional ghosts on the camera, but initially there are fewer ghosts than appear on my camera. After our heroes have a tussle with the main quirky film's director, demanding producer, primadonna actress and they explore for a bit, you are one hour into a 72 minute feature before the first scare.The film needed to be longer, cut out some of the build up, and extend the horror ending.
