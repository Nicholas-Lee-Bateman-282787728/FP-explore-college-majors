831898,A37CC2I37GI7Z2,B0002ERWVE,A Reviewer,"[2, 2]","This first season of ""Touched By An Angel"" is pretty good. I think it's slightly better than Season 2. They don't make shows like this anymore. And so far, there aren't anymore reruns of this show. Therefore, I recommend that all fans of this show should buy this set, along with Seasons 2 and 3. This set also includes the Two-Part Series Finale, ""I Will Walk With You,"" which in my opinion, is a great finale. The only downfall about this set is that the transfer is quite poor on the Season 1 episodes. Now, as far as the picture quality is, it's not all that great. The main problem with the picture is that it is very grainy and there is some jerky images, which is very noticeable in the opening credits. The good thing about the picture is that it's very sharp, but the quality control was obviously poor. As far as the sound quality is, it's quite poor. This Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo sound was very poorly done. It sounds like it wasn't compressed very well. However, all of these quality issues are the exact opposite on the Two-Part Series Finale. On those two episodes, the picture and sound quality is fantastic. The picture is very sharp and was transferred beautifully. The Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo sound on those two episodes is amazing. It has very deep bass, especially on the opening credits.",5,"Good season, considering it's the first.",1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,1310,"['first', 'season', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'slightly', 'better', 'Season', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'shows', 'anymore', 'so', 'far', 'are', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'reruns', 'show', 'Therefore', 'recommend', 'fans', 'show', 'should', 'buy', 'set', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'set', 'also', 'Two-Part', 'Series', 'Finale', 'Will', 'Walk', 'opinion', 'great', 'finale', 'only', 'downfall', 'set', 'transfer', 'quite', 'poor', 'Season', '1', 'episodes', 'Now', 'as', 'far', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'great', 'main', 'problem', 'picture', 'very', 'grainy', 'jerky', 'images', 'very', 'noticeable', 'opening', 'credits', 'good', 'thing', 'picture', 'very', 'sharp', 'quality', 'control', 'was', 'obviously', 'poor', 'As', 'far', 'sound', 'quality', 'quite', 'poor', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'Stereo', 'sound', 'was', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', 'was', ""n't"", 'compressed', 'very', 'well', 'However', 'quality', 'issues', 'are', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Two-Part', 'Series', 'Finale', 'two', 'episodes', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'fantastic', 'picture', 'very', 'sharp', 'was', 'transferred', 'beautifully', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'Stereo', 'sound', 'two', 'episodes', 'amazing', 'very', 'deep', 'bass', 'especially', 'opening', 'credits']",Touched by an Angel - The Complete First Season
831899,A2FL0EKQ2EQ9E6,B0002ERWVE,"a viewer ""a viewer""","[77, 89]","I don't know what happened to all the reviews we had for this program but here is a new one! For nine years we were blessed with the most wonderful, edifying and inspirational family drama ever to grace television. This ranks tops above ""Little House"", ""The Waltons"", etc. Why? Because God had his hand on the program and defied all obstacles and odds to become one of the biggest hits in the history of CBS. FOr years it was the #1 drama on CBS...until some idiot decided to change it from its Sunday night family slot to Saturday nights (a night when no one watches television anymore) and the ratings plummeted....through no fault of the show or its producers. This show could have gone on forever and thanks to DVD it will!! Just release all 9 seasons!! This one will sell like hotcakes....especially from those of us who are tired of garbage on the shelves like ""Sex and the City"", ""West Wing"", ""The Sopranos"", ""Will and Grace"", ""Friends"".....all trash!! Its about time we get back on track with the good morals and standards this show gives us!! Thank you so much! When it is released I'll be the first in line to buy!! You can take that to the bank.Update:  It is now August 31, 2004 and I bought my set today at WalMart.  I was NOT disappointed.  It is everything I hoped for and more!!  Lots of extras including Martha Williamson's interview on 60 minutes, the series finale (which I hope is not a portent toward them not releasing the rest of the seasons).  The images are clear, the color is beautiful and of course the episodes from the first season are all first rate, my favorite being ""There But For the Grace of God"", which ranks among my top five TBAA episodes!  I urge everyone to get out and buy this and tell other TBAA fans also so that we can get season II out there as quickly as possible!!  Bravo!!",5,RELEASE ALL 9 SEASONS!!

831902,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0002ERWVE,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[13, 14]","Nominated for 3 Golden Globes and 12 Emmys, including two by Della Reese for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, Touched By An Angel built a sizeable and loyal audience with its upbeat themes and inspirational storylines. The brainchild of John Masius, creator of Providence (1999) and writer for such hit series as St. Elsewhere (1982) and LA Law (1986), Touched By An Angel follows in the footsteps of Michael Landon's successful series Highway To Heaven, which chronicled the exploits of a single angel who wandered across the United States providing support for lost souls in need of aid. Touched By An Angel is quite similar, but the series uses multiple angels to achieve its purpose. Like Highway To Heaven the series utilizes a contemporary setting and modern problems, allowing the show reach a broad audience who enjoy its themes of love, hope, and redemption...Touched By An Angel follows the exploits of several angels sent to Earth as ""caseworkers"" so as to bring God's message of love, peace, and hope to the distressed people of the world. When the series begins, Monica (Roma Downey) is a novice caseworker still in training (having just been promoted from ""search & rescue""). Assisting Monica, and a caseworker in her own right, is Tess (Della Reese) who lends the wisdom of her many years of experience in dealing with the problems afflicting humanity at large. Together, these two angels interact with people on Earth, easing the burden of each soul with which they come into contact. In later seasons, Monica and Tess would be joined by Andrew (John Dye), the Angel of Death who also fills in as a caseworker to help lighten the load, and in the final two seasons (2001-2003), Gloria (Valerie Bertinelli) would join the trio as a regular recurring angel character... Overall, Touched By An Angel filled a desperately unmet need along the TV programming landscape. With much of today's programming fixated on sex, violence, and ""reality,"" the hour-long CBS drama provided deeply probing family-oriented content which always left its viewers with a positive and upbeat feeling...The Touched By An Angel (Season 1) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the series premiere ""The Southbound Bus"" in which Monica is prepared for her first case since being promoted from angel ""search and rescue"". While on the southbound bus, she befriends a young boy named David who tells her the story of his sister and mother's death in a car accident. But when Monica is hired as David's nanny, she soon learns the truth. David's mother is still alive, and Monica's assignment is to reunite her with her family... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Cassie's Choice"" in which Monica and Tess help a teenager deal with the birth of her child and the decision of whether or not to give her baby up for adoption, and ""There, But for the Grace of God"" in which Monica is stripped of her angelic powers in order to learn a lesson of her own while on a case working with several homeless individuals...Below is a list of episodes included on the Touched By An Angel (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (The Southbound Bus)Episode 2 (Show Me the Way Home)Episode 3 (Tough Love)Episode 4 (Fallen Angela)Episode 5 (Cassie's Choice)Episode 6 (The Heart of the Matter)Episode 7 (An Unexpected Snow)Episode 8 (Snow)Episode 9 (Fear Not!)Episode 10 (There, But for the Grace of God)Episode 11 (The Hero)The DVD Report",5,A family-friendly breath of fresh air...,1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,3433,"['Nominated', '3', 'Golden', 'Globes', '12', 'Emmys', 'including', 'two', 'Della', 'Reese', 'Outstanding', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Drama', 'Series', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'built', 'sizeable', 'loyal', 'audience', 'upbeat', 'themes', 'inspirational', 'storylines', 'brainchild', 'John', 'Masius', 'creator', 'Providence', '1999', 'writer', 'such', 'hit', 'series', 'St', 'Elsewhere', '1982', 'LA', 'Law', '1986', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'footsteps', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'successful', 'series', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'chronicled', 'exploits', 'single', 'angel', 'who', 'wandered', 'United', 'States', 'providing', 'support', 'lost', 'souls', 'need', 'aid', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'quite', 'similar', 'series', 'multiple', 'angels', 'achieve', 'purpose', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'series', 'contemporary', 'setting', 'modern', 'problems', 'allowing', 'show', 'broad', 'audience', 'who', 'themes', 'love', 'hope', 'redemption', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'exploits', 'several', 'angels', 'sent', 'Earth', 'caseworkers', 'so', 'bring', 'God', 'message', 'love', 'peace', 'hope', 'distressed', 'people', 'world', 'When', 'series', 'Monica', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'novice', 'caseworker', 'still', 'training', 'having', 'just', 'been', 'promoted', 'search', 'rescue', 'Assisting', 'Monica', 'caseworker', 'own', 'right', 'Tess', 'Della', 'Reese', 'who', 'wisdom', 'many', 'years', 'experience', 'dealing', 'problems', 'afflicting', 'humanity', 'large', 'Together', 'two', 'angels', 'interact', 'people', 'Earth', 'easing', 'burden', 'soul', 'come', 'contact', 'later', 'seasons', 'Monica', 'Tess', 'would', 'be', 'joined', 'Andrew', 'John', 'Dye', 'Angel', 'Death', 'who', 'also', 'caseworker', 'help', 'lighten', 'load', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', '2001-2003', 'Gloria', 'Valerie', 'Bertinelli', 'would', 'join', 'trio', 'regular', 'recurring', 'angel', 'character', 'Overall', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'filled', 'desperately', 'unmet', 'need', 'TV', 'programming', 'landscape', 'much', 'today', 'programming', 'fixated', 'sex', 'violence', 'reality', 'hour-long', 'CBS', 'drama', 'provided', 'deeply', 'probing', 'family-oriented', 'content', 'always', 'left', 'viewers', 'positive', 'upbeat', 'feeling', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'touching', 'episodes', 'including', 'series', 'premiere', 'Southbound', 'Bus', 'Monica', 'prepared', 'first', 'case', 'being', 'promoted', 'search', 'rescue', 'southbound', 'bus', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'David', 'who', 'story', 'sister', 'mother', 'death', 'car', 'accident', 'when', 'Monica', 'hired', 'David', 'nanny', 'soon', 'truth', 'David', 'mother', 'still', 'alive', 'Monica', 'assignment', 'reunite', 'family', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Cassie', 'Choice', 'Monica', 'Tess', 'help', 'teenager', 'deal', 'birth', 'child', 'decision', 'not', 'give', 'baby', 'up', 'adoption', 'Grace', 'God', 'Monica', 'stripped', 'angelic', 'powers', 'order', 'learn', 'lesson', 'own', 'while', 'case', 'working', 'several', 'homeless', 'individuals', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Touched', 'Angel', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Southbound', 'Bus', 'Episode', '2', 'Show', 'Me', 'Way', 'Home', 'Episode', '3', 'Tough', 'Love', 'Episode', '4', 'Fallen', 'Angela', 'Episode', '5', 'Cassie', 'Choice', 'Episode', '6', 'Heart', 'Matter', 'Episode', '7', 'Unexpected', 'Snow', 'Episode', '8', 'Snow', 'Episode', '9', 'Fear', 'Not', 'Episode', '10', 'Grace', 'God', 'Episode', '11', 'Hero', 'DVD', 'Report']",Touched by an Angel - The Complete First Season

We received our order and can not stop watching this series. We are going through them so fast, that we are chasing down the rest of the seasons.This is fun for the whole family.. We found the first season for $10.00 and some change through Amazon second season for $8.49, we thought that it was cheaper to buy the seasons individually instead of the bundle for over $100.00, so far so good.Touched by an Angel has such great talent, values, morals, and lessons. We are so glad that we are able to view this talent and be entertained with clean T.V. shows.We want to own the whole season for TBAA because we love it! We want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean inspiration, values, and lessons! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch. We are also looking into Sky Angel Fave T.V. Which is affordable and worth the money. Sky Angel has T.V. like Touched By and Angel which will pay for itself though inspiration, clean T.V., morals, values etc.  Sky Angel will leave you filled with encouragement etc.We could not find this show on Netflix and decided to purchase this set as it was more affordable to purchase the set. Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time..So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like this show so it is in demand!Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find this show for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you..

831909,A1LXO4DUE5LL02,B0002ERWVE,Gary L. Stanley,"[45, 48]","Having finally bought my very own copy of Touched By An Angel, the complete first season on DVD yesterday, I'm happy to report that it's still every bit as wonderful and relevant as it was in the initial broadcast. As a 50+ year-old military retiree, I'm happy to say that I love this show and never missed an episode in the 9 years it was on, though it makes me tear up from time to time. Some of the episodes I've viewed multiple times on tape. Since I usually work night shift, I always had to record the show in order to watch it, but it was well worth the time to do so.It's too bad that the television producers don't know how to come up with more wonderful family-oriented programs like this one. The show's producers, directors, writers and especially Roma Downey should have won multiple Emmys, but you know how Hollywood works. The lowest common denominator gets all the kudos. A special 'thank you' goes out to the executive producer, Martha Williamson, without whom this show would have been impossible.Though I've had my first generation Philips DVD player since they were introduced in 1997, I've only bought one other TV series on DVD, which was Smallville, another well-written series that can be viewed together with your family. In 2005, we have a total of 7 DVD-capable units in our household - including 2 computer-mounted, a portable, a PS2 and a DVD recorder - but still a dearth of quality TV shows.Touched By An Angel is the only other one that is worth buying, and I'm certainly glad that I did.Consider this DVD set a worthy investment that you will not regret!PARAMOUNT: Please keep releasing all of the seasons! Thanks!One final note: I believe that angels are real and can appear in any form at any time.

That problem is &#34;Highway to Heaven&#34;.  For me &#34;Touched by an Angel&#34; just can not compare to Michael Landon's show. Jonathan Smith (Michael Landon) was a master at bringing out emotion & he was directly connected to the &#34;Boss&#34;.  No go-in-between, but realize Monica needs a supervisor!

The perfect family show that should have been on T.V. longer...Each story leaves you with a certain impact and unknowily makes you feel a little better about the world around you. I remember spending every Sunday watching this show with my family and decided to buy season's one and two-However Season one is not my favorite- the stories lack what the second season has... but, it's stil just as sweet and endearing as the second season. I love watching the episdodes when things seem to be going wrong for at the end of each of them i have a new kind of faith.The show in many ways is better than the somewhat similiar Joan of Arcadia- in the fact that it makes you see how people during times of struggle-who have began to question their faith come to believe and be changed for the better due to the impacts of angels that have come into their lives.

Episodes included are The Southbound Bus, Show me the Way Home, Tough Love, Fallen Angels, Cassies Choice, The Heart of the Matter, An Unexpected Snow, Manny, Fear Not! which was honestly one of my favourites, The Hero, There But For the Grace of God, Angels on the Air, and In the Name of God which was an excellent episode teaching people why it is so wrong to hate people based on their race and ethinicity or religious affiliations. It even includes I Will Walk with You which looks like it was the last and final episode of the series and a very good episode at that featuring an all star cast.  All of these episodes are beautiful and are tear jerkers but if I could recommend an episode to watch, I'd recommend watching In the Name of God. That is a message so many in this world especially here in America need right now. I will never forget the words of Tess from that episode, &#34; Free will is a gift. Love is a choice. Hate leaves you no choice at all.&#34; There were some later episodes later in the series that I didn't like so much mostly because in the later seasons I felt they brushed upon issues that seemed to doctrinal and lost the message of the first season. The first season will always be the best one and I highly recommend purchasing it for it's messages of hope and love which is something we all need...especially around the holidays. I'd recommend the other seasons as well having remembered watching them on television for so long even the ones that I felt got a little too doctrinal because everyone has a right to watch those and draw their own conclusions about how they feel about them. If you need something to pull you up out of the blues during a holiday season, I recommend this series. It's upbeat. A lot of the time it has a happy ending. It's positive.

I felt a lot sharper picture could have been obtained.  But, I forgive this for the privilege of having these episodes. (I would like to say that Paramount did an absolutely stunning transfer on the Laverne & Shirley boxset!  The picture was stunningly clear and the colors vibrant! Kudos for that!)
