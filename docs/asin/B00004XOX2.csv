The 1st segment is just enough cardio to get you a good full body workout and after about two tries the moves are simple.

The third segment, however, is less strenuous than the third and offers a full body series of flexibility exercices.

556652,A118DD1BQQX1WX,B00004XOX2,James E. White,"[7, 8]","This DVD is broken up into 3 workouts, stamina, strength, and flexibility.  The majority of the poses are beginner level (especially the stamina workout),each workout ranges from 20-30 minutes long.  For a total workout do all 3 consecutively.  I have been practicing yoga for 2+ years at least 5-6 days a week, and this DVD still gets plenty of usage. I think this DVD is challenging enough for intermediate level yoga students (check out some of the arm balances Yee demonstrates in the strength workout) yet easy enough for a beginner to try.  However, Yee's workout is not for the faint of heart, the pace is fast (especially the second and third workouts), and you will sweat.  Also, watch the DVD before you follow along with the routines, because they are fairly fast paced.
