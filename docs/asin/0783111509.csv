Wilson ""Atheen""","[14, 15]","I know the general consensus is that the movie is a little too &quot;dear&quot;, but I rather enjoyed it,--So did my Great Dane Courageous, who watched it entranced.  Perhaps the Dog-Dolphin connection  is real!--but then what I do for a living (surgical intensive care) is so  intense and so often lacking in happy endings that I take whatever  opportunities arise for an emotional vacation.  This was certainly that.  Steve Guttenberg was his usual Mister Nice Guy--he's done that same roll  several times (Three men and a Baby, Cocoon, etc.); he just says different  things each time, but he along with the tropical setting were nice to look  at anyway.  I'm less familiar with Ms Quinlin's vita, but I thought she was  quite creditable as a dedicated bio-oceanographer/dolphin specialist.  Certainly the quest for the elusive grant is a theme with which I am  familiar, working as I do at a university hospital.  I especially enjoyed  seeing veteran bad-guy Arnold Vosloo in a wonderfully comedic roll as the  villianous foil of dog and dolphin.  Some of the expressions on his face  when dealing with the assorted animals in the film were worthy of Cary  Grant in his comedy hay-day (Bringing up Baby and I Was a Male War Bride).  Probably the very best performances however were given by Zeus (the dog)  and Roxanne (the dolphin) who were some of the best trained animals I've  ever seen.  (I do hope Courageous was taking note, as he is often not the  paragon of polished canine behavior!)  My favorite scene was the  &quot;escape of Zeus&quot; by means of the balcony.  Definitely worth a  replay.",4,Dog meets Dolphin,952128000,"03 4, 2000",2000,1605,"['know', 'general', 'consensus', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'quot', 'dear', 'quot', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'So', 'did', 'Great', 'Dane', 'Courageous', 'who', 'watched', 'entranced', 'Perhaps', 'Dog-Dolphin', 'connection', 'real', 'then', 'what', 'do', 'living', 'surgical', 'intensive', 'care', 'so', 'intense', 'so', 'often', 'lacking', 'happy', 'endings', 'take', 'opportunities', 'arise', 'emotional', 'vacation', 'was', 'certainly', 'that', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'was', 'usual', 'Mister', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'done', 'same', 'roll', 'several', 'times', 'Three', 'men', 'Baby', 'Cocoon', 'etc', 'just', 'different', 'things', 'time', 'along', 'tropical', 'setting', 'were', 'nice', 'look', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'less', 'familiar', 'Ms', 'Quinlin', 'vita', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'creditable', 'dedicated', 'bio-oceanographer/dolphin', 'specialist', 'Certainly', 'quest', 'elusive', 'grant', 'theme', 'am', 'familiar', 'working', 'do', 'university', 'hospital', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'veteran', 'bad-guy', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'wonderfully', 'comedic', 'roll', 'villianous', 'foil', 'dog', 'dolphin', 'expressions', 'face', 'when', 'dealing', 'assorted', 'animals', 'film', 'were', 'worthy', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'comedy', 'hay-day', 'Bringing', 'up', 'Baby', 'Was', 'Male', 'War', 'Bride', 'Probably', 'very', 'best', 'performances', 'however', 'were', 'given', 'Zeus', 'dog', 'Roxanne', 'dolphin', 'who', 'were', 'best', 'trained', 'animals', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', 'hope', 'Courageous', 'was', 'taking', 'note', 'often', 'not', 'paragon', 'polished', 'canine', 'behavior', 'favorite', 'scene', 'was', 'quot', 'escape', 'Zeus', 'quot', 'means', 'balcony', 'Definitely', 'replay']",Zeus and Roxanne

Mary Beth Dunhill (Kathleen Quinlan) is a marine biologist working for a small oceanographic institute on the Florida Gulf Coast, struggling to get grant funding, working to return a formerly captive dolphin named Roxanne to the wild, and trying to raise two daughters, 15-year-old Judith (Majandra Delfino) and 12-year-old Nora (Jessica Howell).  When the Barnetts rent a cottage just across from the one the Dunhills are occupying and Zeus becomes fascinated with Roxanne on seeing her leaping and playing in the bay, it changes everyone's lives.  Terry is immediately attracted to Mary Beth, but the crazy circumstances of their meeting seem to mitigate against anything serious.  Then Zeus stows away abord Mary Beth's research boat and, to her astonishment, seems to initiate real interchange with Roxanne.  With some manipulation by the kids, Terry and Mary Beth begin to date--but Terry isn't sure he's over his wife's death.  It takes Zeus, once again, to bring things to their rightful conclusion.  Humor, animals, beautiful scenery, and a nasty-nice villain (Arnold Vosloo as Mary Beth's former supervisor Claude Carver)--what more do you need?  Kids will like them all, and adults will enjoy following the budding (but never overemphasized) romance.  In a way, it isn't just a dog and a dolphin who are learning to communicate: it's animals and humans, a man and a woman, a boy and two girls.  And, after all, communication is something everybody has to master.",4,Interspecies communication,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,1663,"['Terry', 'Barnett', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'widower', 'young', 'son', '10-year-old', 'Jordan', 'Miko', 'Hughes', 'rock', 'opera', 'trying', 'get', 'written', 'scruffy', 'sandy-colored', 'dog', 'illogically', 'named', 'Zeus', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Dunhill', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'marine', 'biologist', 'working', 'small', 'oceanographic', 'institute', 'Florida', 'Gulf', 'Coast', 'struggling', 'get', 'grant', 'funding', 'working', 'return', 'formerly', 'captive', 'dolphin', 'named', 'Roxanne', 'wild', 'trying', 'raise', 'two', 'daughters', '15-year-old', 'Judith', 'Majandra', 'Delfino', '12-year-old', 'Nora', 'Jessica', 'Howell', 'When', 'Barnetts', 'rent', 'cottage', 'just', 'one', 'Dunhills', 'are', 'occupying', 'Zeus', 'becomes', 'fascinated', 'Roxanne', 'seeing', 'leaping', 'playing', 'bay', 'everyone', 'lives', 'Terry', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'crazy', 'circumstances', 'meeting', 'seem', 'mitigate', 'anything', 'serious', 'Then', 'Zeus', 'away', 'abord', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'research', 'boat', 'astonishment', 'initiate', 'real', 'interchange', 'Roxanne', 'manipulation', 'kids', 'Terry', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'begin', 'date', 'Terry', ""n't"", 'sure', 'wife', 'death', 'Zeus', 'once', 'again', 'bring', 'things', 'rightful', 'conclusion', 'Humor', 'animals', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'nasty-nice', 'villain', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'former', 'supervisor', 'Claude', 'Carver', 'what', 'more', 'do', 'need', 'Kids', 'will', 'like', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'following', 'budding', 'never', 'overemphasized', 'romance', 'way', ""n't"", 'just', 'dog', 'dolphin', 'who', 'are', 'learning', 'communicate', 'animals', 'humans', 'man', 'woman', 'boy', 'two', 'girls', 'communication', 'something', 'everybody', 'master']",Zeus and Roxanne
