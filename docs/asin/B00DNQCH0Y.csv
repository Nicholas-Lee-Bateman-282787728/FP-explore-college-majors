The writing isn't flawless and some jokes fall flat, but a new one is right around the corner to sucker punch you in the mouth and take all your loose change to use in a coin-operated ride for a thorough humping. The Cabin in the Woods parody was a standout laugh riot. And yes, I listen to the commentaries, Seth! Don't stop doing them! I actually enjoy your meaningless blathering. And the Chicken Nuggets? Delicious.More of the same great entertainment done right on Robot Chicken.

1659924,A27FPQIWI6VAI9,B00DNQCH0Y,Martin Prehn,"[0, 14]","Okay here we go...I have watched every season of this show and yeah, it's pretty funny. I was watching it and then it suddenly hit me...what about breaking Bad? Only instead of breaking bad it would be (switch the elemental letters) BAKING BREAD. yeah, baking bread and someone would be baking muffins. Yeah, muffins instead of a meth lab it would be a muff lab and  hey, they would be blue. Yeah BLUE muffins and violence and gore would ensue. What a great pitch. And then a further thought hit me. This is exactly what robot chicken does. And it's funny but silly and... well. Really silly.Why do I pay money for this? It's so easy to think this s*** up yourself.This has become too easy. I have not been really impressed by robot chicken since season two. It's kind of cool that there are guys out there making money off of people by spending oodles of time and time stop-motion-animating nerds wet dreams but come on! Is it really THAT easy? Yeah it is.Sorry, but I think it's time to grow up and expect a little more.I just can't get behind this anymore. It's too stupid. Good for you if you can still find something to laugh about but I think I'm out for now. When MY ideas are better than the show I'm watching, then it's time to head on to better stuff. Good luck with this fun franchise, I'm just gonna sit tight for the next thing (like maybe next season of metalocalypse unless I think up something better than that on my own!) - people, aim higher!I'm not saying there is a better obvious alternative, but I AM saying; This is just not good enough.I give it three out of five (and that is as a fan).Anyone else would probably give two.",3,season 6,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,1647,"['Okay', 'here', 'go', 'have', 'watched', 'season', 'show', 'yeah', 'pretty', 'funny', 'was', 'watching', 'then', 'suddenly', 'hit', 'what', 'breaking', 'Bad', 'Only', 'instead', 'breaking', 'bad', 'would', 'be', 'switch', 'elemental', 'letters', 'BAKING', 'BREAD', 'yeah', 'baking', 'bread', 'someone', 'would', 'be', 'baking', 'muffins', 'Yeah', 'instead', 'meth', 'lab', 'would', 'be', 'muff', 'lab', 'hey', 'would', 'be', 'blue', 'Yeah', 'BLUE', 'muffins', 'violence', 'gore', 'would', 'ensue', 'What', 'great', 'pitch', 'then', 'further', 'thought', 'hit', 'exactly', 'what', 'chicken', 'funny', 'silly', 'well', 'Really', 'silly.Why', 'do', 'pay', 'money', 'so', 'easy', 'think', 'up', 'yourself.This', 'become', 'too', 'easy', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'really', 'impressed', 'robot', 'chicken', 'season', 'two', 'kind', 'cool', 'are', 'guys', 'there', 'making', 'money', 'people', 'spending', 'oodles', 'time', 'time', 'stop-motion-animating', 'nerds', 'wet', 'dreams', 'come', 'really', 'easy', 'Yeah', 'is.Sorry', 'think', 'time', 'grow', 'up', 'expect', 'little', 'more.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'anymore', 'too', 'stupid', 'Good', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'something', 'laugh', 'think', ""'m"", 'out', 'now', 'When', 'MY', 'ideas', 'are', 'better', 'show', ""'m"", 'watching', 'then', 'time', 'head', 'better', 'stuff', 'Good', 'luck', 'fun', 'franchise', ""'m"", 'just', 'gon', 'sit', 'tight', 'next', 'thing', 'maybe', 'next', 'season', 'metalocalypse', 'think', 'up', 'something', 'better', 'own', 'people', 'aim', 'higher', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'better', 'obvious', 'alternative', 'AM', 'saying', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'enough.I', 'give', 'three', 'five', 'fan', '.Anyone', 'else', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'two']",Robot Chicken: Season 6
