167416,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,096751780X,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","The storyline or biblical prophecy about the miraculous event known as ""the rapture"", a day when God believing people who have given their lives to God disappearing all over the world as it is featured in the Bible under the Book of Revelations and those left behind having to wonder where are their love ones and according to revelations, the years that follow under Satan's rule until God comes for his believers one last time for those left behind, those who have given their lives to God and taking them to the promise land.There have been a number of interpretations of the rapture and in 1995, Christians have taken the events of the rapture to heart, and courtesy of the best selling novel and series ""Left Behind"", many have changed their lives.But the rapture has also inspired many other books written about it and also in film.  In 1999, the film known as ""The Moment After"" written and directed by Christian filmmaker Wes Llewellyn (""It's Supernatural"", ""Up in the Air"", ""Unbound"") and also written by Amanda Llewellyn and actor Kevin Downes was a popular film that would inspire many people.A low budget Christian film created with a $250,000 budget, the film was quite successful as it was a best seller among Christian film audiences and was also a Crown Award winner of the ""Best Evangelistic Film and Best Drama Film"" and inspired a direct-to-video sequel ""The Moment After 2: The Awakening"" in 2006.VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Moment After"" is featured in Anamorphic Widescreen (1:78:1).  The film is ten years old but doesn't look too dated.  The film has a fine layer of grain and has occasional dust but for the most part, picture quality is fine.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital and is front channel driven.  Dialogue is clear and understandable.  For those with modern home theater receivers can set their audio for ""Stereo"" on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.  The film is not action-driven but for the most part, dialogue is clear.  Audio is in English and Portuguese Stereo.Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Moment After"" features two special features:* Audio Commentary by Director Wes Llewellyn and Co-Writer Amanda Llewellyn - A more technical commentary about the camera shots and the screenplay and what both wanted to see in the scenes and also discussion of set design/construction and more.* Cast Commentary by David A.R. White and Kevin Downes - Pretty entertaining and informative commentary by both main talent who talk about mistakes and other behind-the-scenes information on the talent and the certain scene.JUDGMENT CALL:Overall, ""The Moment After"" was an enjoyable Christian suspenseful drama.  Personally, I found it quite refreshing to watch many years after I finished up the ""Left Behind"" series which was more about the family and the global growing of Christians against the anti-christ, ""The Moment After"" is similar but very different that the storyline is not too focused on a certain family but how two FBI Agents are dealing with the events that have transpired after the rapture.For the character of Adam, he would have conversations with his good friend about the bible and he was at least a listener, while his partner Charles Baker looked at being a law abiding citizen for the fight of good (as an FBI Agent) as being good people.  But what drives the film is not more of the war against some anti-christ or the Global Alliance but people searching for answers.Why was Adam's best friend's family taken but his wife was left behind and this film does a good job of showing that all Christians who believe in God are taken away.  It's more than that and that includes giving yourself to God.  And with the character of Jacob, with his words of ""There are worse things more than just dying"" and for any Christian, God believing person...that sentence alone rings true.""The Moment After"" was an enlightening Christian film with an honest storyline with a strong and powerful message.  It's not a film where you're going to find major CG work or special effects, nor are you going to find any major sign of Hollywood's involvement with this film either.  The DVD contains two solid audio commentary tracks which were both insightful and entertaining.For those who enjoyed the film before or people who have any curiosity towards the rapture and a person who is open to watching Christian films, ""The Moment After"" is film worth watching.  You may actually be inspired after watching it.",4,"A Christian film about the rapture, ""The Moment After"" is an enlightening film with a powerful message.",1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,4488,"['storyline', 'biblical', 'prophecy', 'miraculous', 'event', 'known', 'rapture', 'day', 'when', 'God', 'believing', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'lives', 'God', 'disappearing', 'world', 'featured', 'Bible', 'Book', 'Revelations', 'left', 'having', 'wonder', 'where', 'are', 'love', 'ones', 'according', 'revelations', 'years', 'follow', 'Satan', 'rule', 'God', 'believers', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'left', 'behind', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'lives', 'God', 'taking', 'promise', 'land.There', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'interpretations', 'rapture', '1995', 'Christians', 'have', 'taken', 'events', 'rapture', 'heart', 'courtesy', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'series', 'Left', 'Behind', 'many', 'have', 'changed', 'lives.But', 'rapture', 'also', 'inspired', 'many', 'other', 'books', 'written', 'also', 'film', '1999', 'film', 'known', 'Moment', 'written', 'directed', 'Christian', 'filmmaker', 'Wes', 'Llewellyn', 'Supernatural', 'Air', 'Unbound', 'also', 'written', 'Amanda', 'Llewellyn', 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Downes', 'was', 'popular', 'film', 'would', 'inspire', 'many', 'people.A', 'low', 'budget', 'Christian', 'film', 'created', '250,000', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'successful', 'was', 'best', 'seller', 'Christian', 'film', 'audiences', 'was', 'also', 'Crown', 'Award', 'winner', 'Best', 'Evangelistic', 'Film', 'Best', 'Drama', 'Film', 'inspired', 'direct-to-video', 'sequel', 'Moment', '2', 'Awakening', '2006.VIDEO', 'AUDIO', 'Moment', 'featured', 'Anamorphic', 'Widescreen', '1:78:1', 'film', 'ten', 'years', 'old', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'dated', 'film', 'fine', 'layer', 'grain', 'occasional', 'dust', 'most', 'part', 'picture', 'quality', 'fine.Audio', 'presented', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'front', 'channel', 'driven', 'Dialogue', 'clear', 'understandable', 'modern', 'home', 'theater', 'receivers', 'can', 'set', 'audio', 'Stereo', 'channels', 'more', 'immersive', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'not', 'action-driven', 'most', 'part', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'Audio', 'English', 'Portuguese', 'Stereo.Subtitles', 'are', 'English', 'English', 'SDH', 'Portuguese.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'Moment', 'features', 'two', 'special', 'features', '*', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Wes', 'Llewellyn', 'Co-Writer', 'Amanda', 'Llewellyn', 'more', 'technical', 'commentary', 'camera', 'shots', 'screenplay', 'what', 'wanted', 'see', 'scenes', 'also', 'discussion', 'set', 'design/construction', 'more', '*', 'Cast', 'Commentary', 'David', 'A.R', 'White', 'Kevin', 'Downes', 'Pretty', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'commentary', 'main', 'talent', 'who', 'talk', 'mistakes', 'other', 'behind-the-scenes', 'information', 'talent', 'certain', 'scene.JUDGMENT', 'CALL', 'Overall', 'Moment', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'Christian', 'suspenseful', 'drama', 'Personally', 'found', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'many', 'years', 'finished', 'up', 'Left', 'Behind', 'series', 'was', 'more', 'family', 'global', 'growing', 'Christians', 'anti-christ', 'Moment', 'similar', 'very', 'different', 'storyline', 'not', 'too', 'focused', 'certain', 'family', 'how', 'two', 'FBI', 'Agents', 'are', 'dealing', 'events', 'have', 'transpired', 'rapture.For', 'character', 'Adam', 'would', 'have', 'conversations', 'good', 'friend', 'bible', 'was', 'least', 'listener', 'partner', 'Charles', 'Baker', 'looked', 'being', 'law', 'abiding', 'citizen', 'fight', 'good', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'being', 'good', 'people', 'what', 'film', 'not', 'more', 'war', 'anti-christ', 'Global', 'Alliance', 'people', 'searching', 'answers.Why', 'was', 'Adam', 'best', 'friend', 'family', 'taken', 'wife', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'Christians', 'who', 'believe', 'God', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'more', 'giving', 'God', 'character', 'Jacob', 'words', 'are', 'worse', 'things', 'more', 'just', 'dying', 'Christian', 'God', 'believing', 'person', 'sentence', 'alone', 'true', 'Moment', 'was', 'enlightening', 'Christian', 'film', 'honest', 'storyline', 'strong', 'powerful', 'message', 'not', 'film', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'find', 'major', 'CG', 'work', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'major', 'sign', 'Hollywood', 'involvement', 'film', 'either', 'DVD', 'two', 'solid', 'audio', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'were', 'insightful', 'entertaining.For', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'curiosity', 'rapture', 'person', 'who', 'open', 'watching', 'Christian', 'films', 'Moment', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'inspired', 'watching']",The Moment After VHS

The biggest problem with this project was confining the scope of the story.  They narrowed their focus to a few isolated incidents and only two agents were involved in tracking down the source of a WORLDWIDE disappearance.  There was no fear depicted, no foreboding.  Think about it, a few billion people disappear in the blink of an eye.  That's monumental.  What happened to them!?  There would be a huge impact from such an event.  This movie simply didn't place enough emphasis on that fact.  People would be demanding answers.  I saw none of that here.  They made it seem like a local problem easily dismissed.  I don't believe this film gave the Rapture the level of importance it demands.

White, Kevin Downes and Brad Heller, is a Wes Llewellyn Film and is being released by Sony Pictures. This movie is a Biblical suspense thriller set in present times.The Moment After chronicles the chaos that ensues after millions of people across the world disappear in a flash of light. Two FBI agents (David A.R. White and Kevin Downes) are assigned to find out what happened to cause the disappearances. Both agents interview people to try to find clues to what happened but they aren't finding any answers. David A.R. White starts to have an idea of what may have happened when a letter from the President calls everyone off the case and assigns them to find Jacob Krause, who they are told is creating a paramilitary force.As they begin to search for Jacob Krause, who doesn't seem a likely suspect as a paramilitary leader, David A.R. White starts to suspect he knows just what happened to the millions of people who've disappeared. His partner, Kevin Downes, disagrees. As the government begins to require citizens to have a microchip implanted, David truly accepts what happened and decides to try to help Jacob Krause in his true mission.David A.R. White was also in The Blink of an Eye  and Six The Mark Unleashed. Kevin Downes has also been in To the Wall and Mercy Streets. Brad Heller has been in Six The Mark Unleashed  and Mercy Streets.This is by far one of my favorite Rapture related movies. The acting is superb, the special effects memorable and the movie has an actual plot that isn't totally focussed on preaching.

167421,A2XBBQ36STNJ0G,096751780X,here_is_your_review,"[18, 19]","Though the timing of the Rapture is an oft-debated topic, this is one of the best films you'll find from the pre-tribulational viewpoint.This film reunites David White, Kevin Downes and Brad Heller from ""End of the Harvest"".  If you liked the ""Left Behind"" books and movies, you'll love this film, I guarantee it.  Wes Lewellyn did a terrific job finding scenic locations in California for this movie.Early one morning, the Rapture takes place and two FBI agents are assigned to work a list of 600+ missing persons, including one of their long-time friends.  With each interview, they grow more puzzled at the bizarre event that has just taken place.  Curiously, many seem to want to dismiss it without explanation.Brad Heller is simply excellent as Messianic Jew who comes to know Christ as the Son of God.  Blowing a shofar to signify his new found Faith, Heller as ""Jacob Krause"" begins to evangelize the streets.There's a slight continuity error when Kevin Downe's character walks into a wood shop with dark brown pants.  In the next scene, outside, he's wearing tan pants.  In the director's and the actor's commentary, both included on the DVD version, they have a little laugh about Kevin's ""magic pants"" in this scene.Regardless of one's viewpoint on the Rapture, given Matthew 24:42 and Matthew 24:44, this film at least makes one think.  This film was released in 1999, about a year before ""Left Behind: The Movie"" made its way to stores.The DVD version also includes a theatrical trailer, language selections of English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, the aforementioned actor's commentary, director's commentary and one deleted scene.

167422,A2HIVYSH5QAV7Z,096751780X,"John A. M. Darnell ""Pedantic Voracious""","[13, 13]","Without going into a full discussion of the four major views of an interpretation of the Book of Revelations, this film is representative of the Futurist position, the same position held by such luminaries as Hal Lindsey, Tim LaHaye and Joel C. Rosenberg (not to be confused with the SF writer Joel Rosenberg), and it holds fairly close to the mainline Futurist interpretation of that book. Christ comes to grab His church in the Rapture, which presages the Tribulation, during which 144,00 Jews become evangelists for Christ, saving millions, perhaps billions before the Great and Glorious Day when Christ returns to stop Armageddon and begins His 1000 year rule. I write this review as a Christian, but not necessarily as a Futurist; one who emphatically believes that Christ will return, but perhaps not in the way the Futurists believe (and there are plenty of evangelicals who agree with me--they are more interested in being disciples than tickling their emotions with prophesy candy.)Still, I enjoy a good End Times film as much as any one. They are usually fast-paced and good entertainment, and they always get the Gospel right, which I consider far more important than their prophetic content.And this one was no different.  However, it has a few flaws, hence the four stars.  Though the plot and characterization are great and grab you in the first few minutes, there were things that just didn't sit right with me.  First, however, some good points.Though the dialog started out slightly flat (the actor playing Charles Baker sounded at first like he was reading his lines...he got better though), the script got better and more believable.  And Jacob Krause, the rabbi turned Christian Evangelist, played his role as though it wasn't a role.  Joy shined through him like a brilliant light, sometimes outshining the sun.  I waited for him to return to the screen because he was so good at playing his part. I wanted to be there with him! David White's performance was average, though better than his performance in ""In The Blink of an Eye.""When I slipped this into the player, I had intended to watch only the first twenty minutes of the show and then head off to do something else.  The fact that I stayed for the whole thing shows how quickly this movie grabbed me and would not let me go.  However it did have its flaws.  They were tiny, but present.First, the Mark.  I have no problem with it being a bio-chip, but the Mark will be visible.  The chip isn't/wasn't.  To detect it, it had to be scanned for. Second, a character announces shortly after the Rapture that they are entering the Great Tribulation.  Technically, even for Futurists, that is not correct.  The Tribulation is the seven-year period which starts after the Rapture (unless, of course, the Rapture happens after the Tribulation--and there are some fine arguments for that point of view).  The Great Tribulation starts at the three and a half year point.  And people, if the Futurists are right, you do not want to be around for the Great Tribulation.  It will make the world's present troubles look like a happy party.  But I digres.The third point has to do with the ""Lieutenant"" (actually its the third and fourth point).  The ""Lieutenant"" had the longest hair I have ever seen on a modern soldier, and it looked unkempt (read uncombed and greasy).  Soldiers, especially officers in powerful positions do not groom themselves so slap-dashingly. Couldn't the actor have gotten a haircut?  Hair grows back, you know.  It would have been for a good cause regardless of whether that actor is a believer; it would have made the character more believable.  And finally, the ""Lieutenant"" had captain's bars on his uniform.  Check it out on Wikipedia.  Police LTs have a single bar as a symbol of their rank.These small, but noticeable flaws are the reason for the four stars.

If they were the Gospel is a lie. But not to fear. Jesus is coming back. There will be a Tribulation time for 7 years and the Earth will go on in the New Millenium. One thing this film does that other pre-tribulation films, like Left Behind forget to do is place the actual events of how and what takes place according to scripture that is seen throughout the film. It's not drawn out and gets it's message across clearly with an exciting conclusion. It sticks pretty on the money to all the scriptural truths of the Book of Revelations and Daniel.The story opens when the Rapture has taken place. Then comes two FBI agents, Riley and Baker to investigate the mysterious disappearance. They look into the disappearance of their fellow agent and his family. A woman frantic to find answers of some of the strange occurances that happened around her. She describes in account of the events that has shocked her. Even more mysterious that follows is the appearance of a Jewish man who becomes leader raising an organization to help those left behind. He could hold the key to the truth that the world is searching for. The message...seek and you will find the truth.

I did so because I have seen how easily Christians, especially if they are young and naive, take all end times speculation as gospel truth. What they don't realize is that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different interpretations of the end times out there. A movie likes this touts itself as gospel truth. In fact, the version of events it presents is actually just one interpretation, derived from a particular brand of dispensational teaching.Amongst the doctrines being propogated by this movie are the teaching that the second coming of Christ will be preceded by a 'secret rapture', and that the 144 000 referred to in Revelation are Jews chosen by God to spread the gospel during the period known as the great tribulation. Both teachings are highly debatable, and are dependent upon only one very narrow stream of teaching within evangelical Protestantism (and I would argue that at least the first of these two is blatantly unscriptural). This might not be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that Christians of the sort who would watch a film like this are also usually the sort to want to pin things down into black and white categories and take as absolutely authoritative any and every speculation offered by preachers and teachers on this subject.In any case, this film is not up to much even on its own terms. The two FBI investigators supposedly on the trail of clues as to what lies behind what must surely qualify as the most alarming and catastrophic event in world history, are remarkably laid-back and blase as they set about their task. If such an event as the 'secret rapture' really did occur, I think the response would reflect a little more of the urgency of the situation.That is not to say this is an entirely unenjoyable film. Or that it might not have some impact in terms of what it says about the gospel. But it is ultimately unconvincing, and I think the potential for it to mislead zealous Christians on a path of speculation is greater than its potential to be of real spiritual benefit.",2,Speculative &amp; unconvincing,1015459200,"03 7, 2002",2002,2125,"['was', 'asked', 'show', 'film', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'church', 'where', 'pastor', 'refused', 'did', 'so', 'have', 'seen', 'how', 'easily', 'Christians', 'especially', 'are', 'young', 'naive', 'take', 'end', 'times', 'speculation', 'gospel', 'truth', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'are', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'different', 'interpretations', 'end', 'out', 'there', 'movie', 'gospel', 'truth', 'fact', 'version', 'events', 'actually', 'just', 'one', 'interpretation', 'derived', 'particular', 'brand', 'dispensational', 'teaching.Amongst', 'doctrines', 'being', 'propogated', 'movie', 'are', 'teaching', 'second', 'coming', 'Christ', 'will', 'be', 'preceded', ""'secret"", 'rapture', '144', '000', 'referred', 'Revelation', 'are', 'Jews', 'chosen', 'God', 'spread', 'gospel', 'period', 'known', 'great', 'tribulation', 'teachings', 'are', 'highly', 'debatable', 'are', 'dependent', 'only', 'one', 'very', 'narrow', 'stream', 'teaching', 'evangelical', 'Protestantism', 'would', 'argue', 'least', 'first', 'two', 'blatantly', 'unscriptural', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Christians', 'sort', 'who', 'would', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'usually', 'sort', 'want', 'pin', 'things', 'down', 'black', 'white', 'categories', 'take', 'absolutely', 'authoritative', 'speculation', 'offered', 'preachers', 'teachers', 'subject.In', 'case', 'film', 'not', 'up', 'much', 'even', 'own', 'terms', 'two', 'FBI', 'investigators', 'supposedly', 'trail', 'clues', 'what', 'what', 'must', 'surely', 'qualify', 'most', 'alarming', 'catastrophic', 'event', 'world', 'history', 'are', 'remarkably', 'laid-back', 'blase', 'set', 'task', 'such', 'event', ""'secret"", 'rapture', 'really', 'did', 'occur', 'think', 'response', 'would', 'reflect', 'little', 'more', 'urgency', 'situation.That', 'not', 'say', 'entirely', 'unenjoyable', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'impact', 'terms', 'what', 'gospel', 'ultimately', 'unconvincing', 'think', 'potential', 'mislead', 'zealous', 'Christians', 'path', 'speculation', 'greater', 'potential', 'be', 'real', 'spiritual', 'benefit']",The Moment After VHS
