302790,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,630222716X,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[2, 2]","The Hamilton Woman was Winston Churchill's favorite movie and it is easy to see why. The film tells the story of Lord Nelson's affair with Lady Emma Hamilton, the wife of the ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples and an implied former courtesan whose beauty and wit raised her to the highest levels of English society. Emma is married to a man who acquired her in quite the manner he might acquire one of his beloved objets d'art. Lord Nelson, a hero of the Naploeonic wars is married to a woman who would have been acceptable had he not fallen deeply in love elsewhere. Their love and passion is undeniable and in the way of great passions comes close to destroying the principles, especially the woman, who pay disproportionately for their sins.The two principles, brilliantly played by real life lovers Olivier and Leigh would have been enough to carry the film and make it great, but the writing and the acting of the secondary and tertiary characters is every bit as superb as the leads and this along with the wonderful direction and cinematography raises this far above the usual classic period drama. The viewer sympathizes not only with the love of the principles but with the betrayal and suspicion of the betrayed spouses and even the common soldiers making fun of their commander in a Naples bar. The motives and actions of the characters are evergreen and so is this film. Watch it at your earliest possible convenience.

Alan Mowbray puts in a fantastic performance as Sir William HamiltonEmma Hart (Vivien Leigh), a young woman of easy virtue, arrives in Naples to marry the son of  Sir William Hamilton.  It soon becomes apparent that the son has no intentions of marrying her, and so she enters into a marriage of convenience with Sir William himself.  Years pass and Emma, now Lady Hamilton, meets the acquaintance of Lord Horatio Nelson (Olivier), and they embark on a thrilling affair.  Emma's reputation is pulled through the mud and Nelson returns to battle Napoleon's approaching forces, as the romance rushes to it's tearful conclusion.Regarded as Winston Churchill's favourite film, it was made during the height of WW2, and partly meant to serve as an exercise in morale-boosting amongst the troops, THAT HAMILTON WOMAN is still an enjoyable dramatic experience.  Fans of Vivien Leigh won't be disappointed by her amazing portrayal of Emma Hart Hamilton.  The movie also features Sara Allgood as Emma's mother and Gladys Cooper as Lady Nelson.  Heather Angel plays the young woman to whom Emma tells her story in the prologue.  Rene Hubert designed Vivien Leigh's cavalcade of gorgeous gowns.

It stars Lawrence Olivier as Lord Nelson and Vivien Leigh as Emma Hart Hamilton, with Vivien Leigh fresh from her triumph in ""Gone with the Wind"" and at a time when the real-life romance and marriage between the two stars (Leigh and Olivier) was new.  Up until now this film has only been available on expensive out of print VHS copies or Region 2 DVDs. Now Criterion is releasing a copy that will have all of the extras. The extras are:New, restored high-definition digital transferAudio commentary featuring noted film historian Ian ChristieNew video interview with author and editor Michael Korda, Alexander's nephew, who discusses growing up in the Korda family and the making of That Hamilton Woman.Theatrical trailerAlexander Korda Presents, a 1942 promotional radio piece for the filmPLUS: A booklet featuring an essay by Molly HaskellThe film is largely accurate, which is unusual for an historical drama of its time since these usually took great license with the truth. The departures from the truth that the film took were largely to satisfy the production code of the time.  The truth is that William Hamilton, Emma's older husband, accepted and even encouraged the affair between his wife and Lord Nelson. When Emma set up housekeeping with Lord Nelson in England, William Hamilton lived there with them in a menage a trois relationship that fascinated the public of the time. In 1941 this would have been unacceptable on the screen.The implication of the film is that Emma's daughter by Lord Nelson died. In fact their daughter married a man of the cloth, had ten children, and died at the age of 80. Emma's end as it is portrayed in the film is sadly accurate. Women of Emma's time were largely dependent upon their station in life and upon the whims of the men in their lives.

302797,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,630222716X,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 3]","""That Hamilton Woman"" tells the true story of Lady Emma Hamilton and Lord Nelson around the turn of the 19th century. It stars Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier and was produced by Alexander Korda. The film was released in the UK under the name ""Lady Hamilton"".""That Hamilton Woman"" was the last of three films that Laurence Olivier (1907-1989) and his wife Vivien Leigh (1913-67) made together. They met in 1935 and began their affair during ""Fire Over England"" (1937). They made ""21 Days Together"" (1940) and ""That Hamilton Woman"" (1941), and toured together many times in performances of ""Anthony and Cleopatra"", ""Macbeth"", ""Twelfth Night"", and ""The School for Scandal"". They divorced in 1960.Leigh is best known for her stunning performances in ""GWTW"" (1939) as Scarlett O'Hara and as Blanche Dubois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) - she won the Oscar both times. Eventually physical problems, a miscarriage, and the difficulty of living with Olivier would take their toll and she began a slow descent into madness, perhaps precipitated by the 326 performances as Dubois on stage in London followed by months filming the movie. Between 1955 and 1965 she made only 1 film, but she carried on with her theatre work and even won a Tony in 1963. Her last film appearance was in 1965 (""Ship of Fools"").Olivier was nominated for an Oscar 10 times, from 1939 (""Wuthering Heights"") to 1978 (""Boys from Brazil""), and won in 1949 for ""Hamlet"". He appeared in 80+ films, usually as an Englishman or in films based in England.  His prime period had been in the 40s, and he made few films in the 50s, probably because of all the personal problems he was having. He appears as #14 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.Alan Mowbray (1896-1969) appeared in more than 140 films from 1931 to 1962. He had a recurring role in the ""Topper"" series and made memorable contributions to films such as ""The King and I"" (1956), ""The Man who Knew Too Much"" (1956), ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946) and ""Wagon Master"" (1950). Mowbray plays Sir William Hamilton, Leigh's husband.Sara Allgood (1879-1950) plays Leigh's Irish mother. She appeared in more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941). Allgood's chubby face and Irish brogue contributed to films like ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1941), ""The Fabulous Dorseys"", and ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" (1950). My favorite Allgood performance was as John Garfield's mother in ""Between Two Worlds"" (1944).Alexander Korda (1893-1956) produced nearly 60 films in his career that started in 1923 in Hungary. His break through film was ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) and there followed a series of historical dramas including ""Rise of Catherine the Great"" (1934), ""Private Life of Don Juan"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934) and ""Rembrandt"" (1936). Korda was known for his cheap production values, which are sometimes evident in this film, although the Italian palace scenes are lavish.The film came in 1940 and did not shrink for talking about the European menace to the ""little island"" that cradled civilization. In the film it is Bonaparte vs. England, but the mood is clearly Hitler vs. England and many of the speeches refer in general to ""Europe"" rather than ""France"" since France was an ally. There are a plethora of films from this period that conform to this standard, and it's always interesting to see how history is portrayed in the light of current events.The film is a tour d'force for Vivien Leigh. She is in virtually every scene and unless Sara Allgood is around, she is the scene stealer. In the early years she seems to be channeling Scarlett O'Hara and one expects her any minute to exclaim ""Fiddle dee dee"", but as she ages (in the film) she takes on a more mature persona. Quite frankly IMO her acting in this film is even better than her performance in ""GWTW"".BTW - We have many portraits of Emma Hamilton, the most famous of which were done by George Romney, and Leigh often moves in ways to suggest many of these fine portraits. Hamilton was one of the most beautiful women of her age, as was Leigh.Olivier, on the other hand, is unconvincing as Lord Nelson, the hero of the British Empire. He seems to be more like ""Hamlet at Sea"" than the inspirational leader and master of strategy.In retrospect there is a melancholy to this film in the parallel it has to Leigh's own life (much as there is sadness to ""Citizen Kane"" and Orson Welles' life).  Just as in the film, Leigh came from a modest background, and just as in the film, she began an affair with a married man. Eventually they were together and for awhile they were happy and then began the slow decline. Both suffered the loss of a child and both suffered physical problems before the end.If you enjoy historical drama, or just want to see one of the finest performances ever by an actress.

L'hoir,"[5, 5]","My mother took me to see ""That Hamilton Woman"" sixty-eight years ago in a Hollywood movie theatre, and I have never forgotten either the film, or its poignant last line. I am therefore happy to discover that far from being a remnant of my child's imagination, the film has lost none of its charm. In Black and White, its excellence exudes virtual ""colour"" because of its splendid combination of romance and history, its magnificent cinematography, and the acting of its protagonists.Vivien Leigh portrays Emma, Lady Hamilton, with coquettish grace, and Lawrence Olivier endows Horatio Nelson with proper ""heart of oak"". Both of them suggest a selfishness of the ""all for love and the world well lost"" variety. Alan Mobray, who plays Sir William Hamilton, conveys a quiet dignity as he acknowledges the inevitability of the notorious love affair of his wife, who was some thirty-four years his junior. Hamilton, British Ambassador to the court of Naples at the turn of the 18th century, was a a noted antiquarian who, along with the King and Queen of Naples, ""collected"" artifacts from the newly discovered Pompeii and Herculaneum. He has married Emma out of charity, and, because of guilt, she accuses of him of collecting her along with his statues and art objects. The only character I did not care for was Lady Nelson, who was relentlessly glacial. One gets the feeling that Alexander Korda directed her to be as unsympathetic as possible, in order to weight the audience's sympathies in favor of the lovers, since the morality of the affair was considered unsuitable in the cinema of the 'forties.The Battle of Trafalgar is breathtaking. HMS Victory was constructed to scale, but the ships-of-the-line in the background were the size of dinghies, manipulated like puppets by prop men inside of them. The battle took place in a tank with wind machines that roil the water convincingly. One would never guess that this elegant set was jerrybuilt on a low budget. It makes many of the CGI effects in films today seem paltry in comparison.According to Michael Korda's fascinating interview, Churchill encouraged Alexander Korda to make the film for propaganda purposes in order to get the United States to join the war--a problem that became irrelevant by December of 1941; and while the anti-Napoleon/tyrant message may seem quaint to today's audience, it certainly did not when I first saw the film. To us Americans, Nelson epitomised British courage in the face of the onslaught of the twentieth-century tyrant, whom I am not going to dignify with a name, and what can, without hyperbole, be termed the forces of evil. Although the same message was conveyed with slightly more subtlety in ""Casablanca"" of the previous year, considered in its historical context, it is not out of place in ""That Hamilton Woman,"" the performances of which transcend the message.",5,One of the Greats!,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,2862,"['mother', 'took', 'see', 'Hamilton', 'Woman', 'sixty-eight', 'years', 'ago', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'theatre', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'film', 'poignant', 'last', 'line', 'am', 'therefore', 'happy', 'discover', 'far', 'being', 'remnant', 'child', 'imagination', 'film', 'lost', 'none', 'charm', 'Black', 'White', 'excellence', 'exudes', 'virtual', 'colour', 'splendid', 'combination', 'romance', 'history', 'magnificent', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'protagonists.Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Emma', 'Lady', 'Hamilton', 'coquettish', 'grace', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'Horatio', 'Nelson', 'proper', 'heart', 'oak', 'suggest', 'selfishness', 'love', 'world', 'well', 'lost', 'variety', 'Alan', 'Mobray', 'who', 'Sir', 'William', 'Hamilton', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'inevitability', 'notorious', 'love', 'affair', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'thirty-four', 'years', 'junior', 'Hamilton', 'British', 'Ambassador', 'court', 'Naples', 'turn', '18th', 'century', 'was', 'noted', 'antiquarian', 'who', 'King', 'Queen', 'Naples', 'collected', 'artifacts', 'newly', 'discovered', 'Pompeii', 'Herculaneum', 'married', 'Emma', 'charity', 'guilt', 'collecting', 'along', 'statues', 'art', 'objects', 'only', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'was', 'Lady', 'Nelson', 'who', 'was', 'relentlessly', 'glacial', 'One', 'feeling', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'directed', 'be', 'as', 'unsympathetic', 'possible', 'order', 'weight', 'audience', 'sympathies', 'favor', 'lovers', 'morality', 'affair', 'was', 'considered', 'unsuitable', 'cinema', ""'forties.The"", 'Battle', 'Trafalgar', 'breathtaking', 'HMS', 'Victory', 'was', 'constructed', 'scale', 'ships-of-the-line', 'background', 'were', 'size', 'dinghies', 'manipulated', 'puppets', 'prop', 'men', 'battle', 'took', 'place', 'tank', 'wind', 'machines', 'roil', 'water', 'convincingly', 'One', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'elegant', 'set', 'was', 'jerrybuilt', 'low', 'budget', 'many', 'CGI', 'effects', 'films', 'today', 'seem', 'paltry', 'comparison.According', 'Michael', 'Korda', 'fascinating', 'interview', 'Churchill', 'encouraged', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'make', 'film', 'propaganda', 'purposes', 'order', 'get', 'United', 'States', 'join', 'war', 'problem', 'became', 'irrelevant', 'December', '1941', 'anti-Napoleon/tyrant', 'message', 'may', 'seem', 'quaint', 'today', 'audience', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'Americans', 'Nelson', 'epitomised', 'British', 'courage', 'face', 'onslaught', 'twentieth-century', 'tyrant', 'whom', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'dignify', 'name', 'what', 'can', 'hyperbole', 'be', 'termed', 'forces', 'evil', 'same', 'message', 'was', 'conveyed', 'slightly', 'more', 'subtlety', 'Casablanca', 'previous', 'year', 'considered', 'historical', 'context', 'not', 'place', 'Hamilton', 'Woman', 'performances', 'transcend', 'message']",N/A

Horatio is married to a widow who has a son.Vivien Leigh who plays Emma, the young attractive girl from London comes to Naples with her mother. In a scheme created by her lover of 5 years to get her away from London, so that he can marry an heiress. He sends her to his uncle Sir William Hamilton, the British Ambassador to England.  Emma is very distraught with hearing the news but the promises of Hamilton,  infatuates her and she remains in Naples.  Shortly after, she becomes Lady Hamilton.  He is 40 years older.Turbulent times call for fresh ideas and this is exactly what Emma gives to Horatio through her exceptional contacts with the Queen, wife of the King of Naples.  Her ""attitudes"" win over many favors from the King and Horatio promises the King that he will defend Italy, against Napoleon.The adulteress affair begins, later a child is born Horatia (but never seen), Horatio goes off to war once more and the rest is history.Emma at the end of her life, is distraught, penniless and childless.

302804,A106016KSI0YQ,630222716X,Jay Dickson,"[4, 4]","As soon as you see Alexander Korda's classic 1941 film of the star-crossed love of Lord Horatio Nelson and Emma, Lady Hamilton you'll see why it was Winston Churchill's favorite film, which he reputedly screened dozens and dozens of times. Korda spared almost no expense on the sets, which are grandly elaborate on a scale worthy of MGM; the sea battles, particularly at Trafalgar, are beautifully and elaborately detailed, and show terrific models in almost convincing military action; and there are multiple propagandistic speeches about standing up to tyrants and allowing little England its freedom that clearly spoke to the Second World War (right then near its darkest hour). And in the leads there are the real-life couple of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, showing genuine sexual chemistry and intelligence between them. The part of Emma Hamilton is basically tailor-made for Leigh: she gets to show off some of her usual bursts of minxish energy in the film's early sections, when she's a foolish thing being wooed by Sir William Hamilton; later, bowed by worry and love, she gets to show her more skills as a mature woman that did not endear her to her public quite as much as her vixenish sulks (as with Scarlett O'Hara in the early scenes of GONE WITH THE WIND) but where she showed her genuine talents laid. And this is one of Olivier's best roles: he's quite sexy as Lord Nelson, despite the convincing makeup that shows his wounds and ruined eye after the Battle of the Nile, and he manages to seem simultaneously sure of himself in battle and winningly underconfident in matters of the heart.They are given little help from their supporting cast, the film's weakest aspect: to stack the deck in terms of the audience's sympathies in favor of Lady Hamilton, Gladys Cooper, in her most inflexible and unlovable form, is cast as the frowning Lady Nelson; Alan Mowbray fares slightly better as the limping elderly Sir William Hamilton; and Sara Allgood gets a few good jokes as Emma's mother despite her clumsy line readings. The best reason to see the film, other than for its stars, are for its gorgeous cinematography, restored to almost pristine purity by Criterion, and its astonishing sets (there is an interior of the main hall outside the old House of Lords that is a kind of miracle of matte painting effects).",4,Love and war,1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,2334,"['As', 'soon', 'see', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'classic', '1941', 'film', 'star-crossed', 'love', 'Lord', 'Horatio', 'Nelson', 'Emma', 'Lady', 'Hamilton', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'was', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'favorite', 'film', 'reputedly', 'screened', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'times', 'Korda', 'spared', 'almost', 'expense', 'sets', 'are', 'grandly', 'elaborate', 'scale', 'worthy', 'MGM', 'sea', 'battles', 'particularly', 'Trafalgar', 'are', 'beautifully', 'elaborately', 'detailed', 'show', 'terrific', 'models', 'almost', 'convincing', 'military', 'action', 'are', 'multiple', 'propagandistic', 'speeches', 'standing', 'up', 'tyrants', 'allowing', 'little', 'England', 'freedom', 'clearly', 'spoke', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'right', 'then', 'darkest', 'hour', 'leads', 'are', 'real-life', 'couple', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'showing', 'genuine', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'intelligence', 'part', 'Emma', 'Hamilton', 'basically', 'tailor-made', 'Leigh', 'show', 'off', 'usual', 'bursts', 'minxish', 'energy', 'film', 'early', 'sections', 'when', 'foolish', 'thing', 'being', 'wooed', 'Sir', 'William', 'Hamilton', 'later', 'bowed', 'worry', 'love', 'show', 'more', 'skills', 'mature', 'woman', 'did', 'not', 'endear', 'public', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'vixenish', 'sulks', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'early', 'scenes', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'where', 'showed', 'genuine', 'talents', 'laid', 'one', 'Olivier', 'best', 'roles', 'quite', 'sexy', 'Lord', 'Nelson', 'convincing', 'makeup', 'wounds', 'ruined', 'eye', 'Battle', 'Nile', 'seem', 'simultaneously', 'sure', 'battle', 'winningly', 'underconfident', 'matters', 'heart.They', 'are', 'given', 'little', 'help', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'weakest', 'aspect', 'stack', 'deck', 'terms', 'audience', 'sympathies', 'favor', 'Lady', 'Hamilton', 'Gladys', 'Cooper', 'most', 'inflexible', 'unlovable', 'form', 'cast', 'frowning', 'Lady', 'Nelson', 'Alan', 'Mowbray', 'slightly', 'better', 'limping', 'elderly', 'Sir', 'William', 'Hamilton', 'Sara', 'Allgood', 'few', 'good', 'jokes', 'Emma', 'mother', 'clumsy', 'line', 'readings', 'best', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'other', 'stars', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'restored', 'almost', 'pristine', 'purity', 'Criterion', 'astonishing', 'sets', 'interior', 'main', 'hall', 'old', 'House', 'Lords', 'kind', 'miracle', 'matte', 'painting', 'effects']",N/A

I did enjoy it but I guess I expected there to be more about her life before she came to Naples and more about it after Lord Hamilton and Lord Nelson were dead.  Was it possible in that day and age for a husband to leave his wife nothing of his estate?  I guess so as she was apparently destitute. The commentary explains how this happened. Knowing of the romance between Olivier and Leigh I had expected there to be more fire in their relationship.  Of course Leigh can always convey passionate love when she wants to - look at her adoration of Ashley in Gone With the Wind - but I didn't see so much of that here. It felt like they were both holding back and maybe that was because of their deep personal attachment to each other.  It was certainly beautifully filmed and the DVD was quite crisp with only a fine line showing every now and then. LATER: I have now looked at the commentary of this film and it is excellent.  Much better than most commentaries as it is very informative and fills in a lot of blanks that the film leaves.  Also, in looking at the film again I see things that I did not see before in the relationship between Emma and Nelson. I believe that the commentary helped me to see these things. I recommend that everyone be sure to see this film with the commentary at some time. It gave me a better understanding of why the film was made quickly. England was about to become involved in WWII with Germany being the same type of agressor that Nelson faced in Napoleon. The telling of the story of Churchill watching this movie (for the 4th or 5th time)on board a ship bringing him to America to meet with Roosevelt and how moved he was at the death scene of Nelson was extremely moving. Nelson's line ""England Expects Every Man to do his Duty"" was so appropriate for the time this movie was being seen in England. Just one more thing.

302807,A2DSXA1E02C86D,630222716X,Joseph Haschka,"[21, 23]","Released in early 1941 during the time when England was at its most beleaguered, THAT HAMILTON WOMAN is reputed to have been Prime Minister Winston Churchill's favorite film, which, if true, is prima-facie evidence that he was an old softie at heart.A frothy historical romance as only Hollywood could create, the film is broadly faithful to the facts. Low-born Emma Hart (Vivien Leigh), the courtesan lover of the English aristocrat Charles Greville, is shipped off in 1786 to Naples to be, unbeknownst to her, the mistress of Greville's uncle, England's envoy to the Kingdom of Naples, Sir William Hamilton (Alan Mowbray). But, William is so smitten by Emma's beauty as to marry her, and the latter becomes Lady Emma Hamilton in 1791. In that capacity, she first meets Horatio Nelson (Laurence Olivier) in 1793, when he anchors his ship in Naples to officially seek the kingdom's help in providing reinforcements against the French. They don't meet again until five years later, after Nelson's famous victory in the Battle of the Nile, by which time he's lost an arm and his health. The latter is restored to the Admiral while under the Hamiltons' roof and Emma's care, during which time Nelson and his nurse fall in love. The rest is history. The Hamiltons and the Admiral returned to England where, in 1801, all three - or four, if you count Horatia, Nelson's daughter by Emma - moved into a house near present day Wimbledon purchased by Horatio after spurning his legal wife, Frances. William Hamilton died in 1803. Nelson died a national hero at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Ignored by the British government, Emma became destitute and died an alcoholic in Calais in 1815. Indeed, it's in Calais that THAT HAMILTON WOMAN opens and closes; Emma tells her story in flashback form to a fellow prison inmate (Heather Angel) after being arrested for public disorderliness.THAT HAMILTON WOMAN is perhaps typical of the genre of the time. It's a good film, not great. The chief reason to watch is to discern its appeal to Churchill, who obviously found inspiration and a kindred spirit in the Tinseltown Nelson, whose impassioned speeches against the continental tyrant (Napoleon) and the need for his country to fight the dictator even if England stood alone reflected Winston's own feelings about the battle against Hitler and Nazi Germany in the months before Pearl Harbor and America's entry into the war, the salvation so desperately sought by the PM.From an historical point of view, the serious or casual student of the Trafalgar naval confrontation between the British and Franco-Spanish fleets will likely find fault. The battle scenes, using ship models, show vessels blowing up in great cataclysms of fire and smoke, and one actually capsizes. Trafalgar wasn't like that. Tactics dictated that opposing battleships maneuver up close and personal and fire withering volleys of hard, non-explosive shot at each other at point blank range to take down masts, reduce the decks (above the waterline) to kindling, and kill as many opposing sailors as possible. Only then would a ship surrender and be taken and converted to prize-money by the victorious captain and crew. To this end, actual sinking of an opponent was counterproductive. For a better understanding of Trafalgar and naval tactics of the period, I recommend Adam Nicolson's excellent book,Seize the Fire : Heroism, Duty, and the Battle of Trafalgar.Any Vivien Leigh fan will find much to like in THAT HAMILTON WOMAN though, since GONE WITH THE WIND had been released only a couple of years prior, I kept half-expecting Leigh's character to break into a southern accent and pine for Tara. I especially liked the melodramatic ending when, after Captain Hardy (Henry Wilcoxon) rides his gallant steed off-camera after breaking the news of Nelson's death to Emma, the latter shuts the drapes across a massive window and collapses in a faint - a nice allusion to ""the final curtain"" closing on an epic love story. How ""Hollywood"" can you get?Since this DVD was produced by Buddha Video in Taiwan, there's the unusual (to American audiences) availability of Chinese subtitles.

I was half expecting her to go into her Scarlet bit while Olivier (Nelson) was being dragged along with the story.  The production value is certainly first-rate, although a bit inaccurate at times.  The film's music was certainly not period at all, and at one point one hears ""A Life on the Ocean Wave"" in the background, a march written for Royal Marine Bands in the 1880s.  So much for accuracy!  ""Hearts of Oak"" was much better and the words to it inspiring to hear.  One can tell this is a WW2 film, as references to Bonaparte seem awfully much like Hitler!The final battle scene at Trafalgar is again typical movie fair for the time.  Very patriotic and glorious, with Nelson expiring in true heroic fashion onboard Victory at the end.

302819,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,630222716X,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[1, 1]","During their time, Nelson and Lady Hamilton were even greater ""Stars"" than were Leigh and Olivier in later times.  Simultaneously, the liaison between Nelson and Hamilton was attended by far more intrigue, gossip and outrage than Olivier's marriage to Leigh ever was.  I believe this film does real justice to the Nelson-Hamilton relationship and, amazingly [and I've checked], doesn't even veer too far from known--and highly publicized--facts.  Other films have been produced about Nelson depicting Hamilton as bloussy, foul-mouthed and unattractive.  Nelson's attraction for her--if the foregoing were true--remains a mystery.It seems, however, that Lady Emma Hamilton had what it takes.  The famous painter, George Romney, fell in love with her when Emma was still a teenager.  He painted many portraits of her and, as a young woman, she was genuinely beautiful.  She was uneducated and likely her diction and grammar reflected her lack of training [quite unlike the elegant Vivian Leigh in the movie].  On the other hand, she attracted powerful men like honey attracts bees and she seems to have had genuine talent developing a 'Mime' art form which she called 'Attitudes'.  She oftentimes dressed up like a Grecian nymph in filmy clothing and danced for paying audiences.  Many of the portraits of her are of 'Baccanante', apparently the female consort of Bacchus, the god of wine, song, sex, and having a good time.  All these things probably appealed to the lively Emma.  She passed from important man to important man until she married Sir Hamilton in Naples.There she met Nelson and following the Battle of the Nile, when Nelson returned shot to pieces [including the loss of most of his teeth], Emma nursed him back to a semblance of health.  Despite Nelson's appearance, Emma fell deeply in love with him and this love lasted beyond Nelson's death, perhaps to the end of Emma's unfortunate life.Just as depicted in the film, Nelson and Hamilton were flagrant in their adulterous love affair and openly lived together in England.  Emma's husband evidentially didn't disapprove, but the attitude of Nelson's wife may have been considerably different.  Just as movie stars of today following unorthodox life styles, the newspapers couldn't seem to get enough Emma and Horatio stories.  Such publicity may have cut Nelson's wife deeply.Any other person, at any other time, might have been ruined and drummed out of the Navy....but...England was in deep trouble.  As moralistic and judgmental as English society was in those days, the Admiralty put necessity before morality.  Therefore...Nelson battled Napoleon at Cape Trafalgar and the world might be a slightly better place because of it.",5,"Kiss Me, Hardy",1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,2699,"['time', 'Nelson', 'Lady', 'Hamilton', 'were', 'even', 'greater', 'Stars', 'were', 'Leigh', 'Olivier', 'later', 'times', 'Simultaneously', 'liaison', 'Nelson', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'attended', 'far', 'more', 'intrigue', 'gossip', 'outrage', 'Olivier', 'marriage', 'Leigh', 'ever', 'was', 'believe', 'film', 'real', 'justice', 'Nelson-Hamilton', 'relationship', 'amazingly', '[', ""'ve"", 'checked', ']', ""n't"", 'even', 'veer', 'too', 'far', 'known', 'highly', 'publicized', 'facts', 'Other', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'Nelson', 'depicting', 'Hamilton', 'bloussy', 'foul-mouthed', 'unattractive', 'Nelson', 'attraction', 'foregoing', 'were', 'true', 'mystery.It', 'however', 'Lady', 'Emma', 'Hamilton', 'had', 'what', 'famous', 'painter', 'George', 'Romney', 'fell', 'love', 'when', 'Emma', 'was', 'still', 'teenager', 'painted', 'many', 'portraits', 'young', 'woman', 'was', 'genuinely', 'beautiful', 'was', 'uneducated', 'likely', 'diction', 'grammar', 'reflected', 'lack', 'training', '[', 'quite', 'elegant', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'movie', ']', 'other', 'hand', 'attracted', 'powerful', 'men', 'honey', 'attracts', 'bees', 'have', 'had', 'genuine', 'talent', 'developing', ""'Mime"", 'art', 'form', 'called', ""'Attitudes"", 'dressed', 'up', 'Grecian', 'nymph', 'filmy', 'clothing', 'danced', 'paying', 'audiences', 'Many', 'portraits', 'are', ""'Baccanante"", 'apparently', 'female', 'consort', 'Bacchus', 'god', 'wine', 'song', 'sex', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'things', 'probably', 'appealed', 'lively', 'Emma', 'passed', 'important', 'man', 'important', 'man', 'married', 'Sir', 'Hamilton', 'Naples.There', 'met', 'Nelson', 'following', 'Battle', 'Nile', 'when', 'Nelson', 'returned', 'shot', 'pieces', '[', 'including', 'loss', 'most', 'teeth', ']', 'Emma', 'nursed', 'back', 'semblance', 'health', 'Nelson', 'appearance', 'Emma', 'fell', 'deeply', 'love', 'love', 'lasted', 'Nelson', 'death', 'perhaps', 'end', 'Emma', 'unfortunate', 'life.Just', 'depicted', 'film', 'Nelson', 'Hamilton', 'were', 'flagrant', 'adulterous', 'love', 'affair', 'openly', 'lived', 'together', 'England', 'Emma', 'husband', 'evidentially', 'did', ""n't"", 'disapprove', 'attitude', 'Nelson', 'wife', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'considerably', 'different', 'Just', 'movie', 'stars', 'today', 'following', 'unorthodox', 'life', 'styles', 'newspapers', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'enough', 'Emma', 'Horatio', 'stories', 'Such', 'publicity', 'may', 'have', 'cut', 'Nelson', 'wife', 'other', 'person', 'other', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ruined', 'drummed', 'Navy', '.but', 'England', 'was', 'deep', 'trouble', 'moralistic', 'judgmental', 'English', 'society', 'was', 'days', 'Admiralty', 'put', 'necessity', 'morality', 'Therefore', 'Nelson', 'battled', 'Napoleon', 'Cape', 'Trafalgar', 'world', 'might', 'be', 'slightly', 'better', 'place']",N/A

Trivia buffs should know that this was Winston Churchill's favourite film; he had it screened many times. Only part of the astonishing life of Emma, Lady Hamilton is told in this big, sprawling Alexander Korda movie, which makes of Napoleon an earlier Hitler and of Naples an 18th Century warning to America. Her real name was Amy Lyon. Before she married aging Sir William Hamilton, British Prime Minister to the Kingdom of Naples, she had lived in the London slums, passed from hand to hand, bore several illegitimate children and posed as Circe, Cassandra, Nature, Joan of Arc and Mary Magdalene for George Romney, the great English portrait painter. At Naples, she created endless scandal, became the crony of Queen Maria Carolina and met young English Naval Captain Horatio Nelson. From then on, their lives were constantly intertwined, making choice chatter for London gossips. Meanwhile, the young captain chased Napoleon's fleet around the Mediterranean, lost an eye and an arm, became the idolised ""Victor of the Nile"", the immortal Lord Nelson who died of a sharpshooter's ball at the Battle of Trafalgar (1805). Producer Korda makes of his heroism an epic of British defiance to dictators, of Emma's sordid life - a romance in the lush PRISONER OF ZENDA style.",4,LORD AND LADY OLIVIER.,1005350400,"11 10, 2001",2001,1410,"['Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'make', 'beautiful', 'pair', 'portray', 'Lady', 'Emma', 'Hamilton', 'Lord', 'Horatio', 'Nelson', 'THAT', 'HAMILTON', 'WOMAN', 'Trivia', 'buffs', 'should', 'know', 'was', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'favourite', 'film', 'had', 'screened', 'many', 'times', 'Only', 'part', 'astonishing', 'life', 'Emma', 'Lady', 'Hamilton', 'told', 'big', 'sprawling', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'movie', 'Napoleon', 'earlier', 'Hitler', 'Naples', '18th', 'Century', 'warning', 'America', 'real', 'name', 'was', 'Amy', 'Lyon', 'married', 'aging', 'Sir', 'William', 'Hamilton', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Kingdom', 'Naples', 'had', 'lived', 'London', 'slums', 'passed', 'hand', 'hand', 'several', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'posed', 'Circe', 'Cassandra', 'Nature', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'George', 'Romney', 'great', 'English', 'portrait', 'painter', 'Naples', 'created', 'endless', 'scandal', 'became', 'crony', 'Queen', 'Maria', 'Carolina', 'met', 'young', 'English', 'Naval', 'Captain', 'Horatio', 'Nelson', 'then', 'lives', 'were', 'constantly', 'intertwined', 'making', 'choice', 'chatter', 'London', 'gossips', 'Meanwhile', 'young', 'captain', 'chased', 'Napoleon', 'fleet', 'Mediterranean', 'lost', 'eye', 'arm', 'became', 'idolised', 'Victor', 'Nile', 'immortal', 'Lord', 'Nelson', 'who', 'died', 'sharpshooter', 'ball', 'Battle', 'Trafalgar', '1805', 'Producer', 'Korda', 'heroism', 'epic', 'British', 'defiance', 'dictators', 'Emma', 'sordid', 'life', 'romance', 'lush', 'PRISONER', 'OF', 'ZENDA', 'style']",N/A

It is war film based on the true story of Lord Horatio Nelson and his mistress Lady Hamilton. The film was intended to boost morale among Britons during the war and it worked incredibly well and became Churchill's favorite movie and he is reputed to have watched the movie over a hundred times.The starring roles are played by Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. Their acting is incredible and the film's editing style is great too. The most memorable scene for me is a distant night shot of the Royal Navy's ships in harbor with the crews beautifully singing ""Londonderry Air."" I think this is one of the greatest scenes ever used in a movie. This is a timeless classic and on lists of the greatest British films ever made.The special features include an interview with director Alexander Korda's nephew, Michael Korda, a promotional radio presentation for the film, the theatrical, and audio commentary by film historian, Ian Christie.I recommend this film highly.",5,Winston Churchill's favorite movie.
