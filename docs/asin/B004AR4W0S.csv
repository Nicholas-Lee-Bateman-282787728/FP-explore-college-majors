1393759,A2I6DISKM0YKM8,B004AR4W0S,Just a Mom with her thoughts,"[13, 14]","Before receiving Super Why! Humpty Dumpty & Other Fairytale Adventures, my son had not seen Super Why!, but oh my goodness, he is now officially addicted. (Is there a 12-step program for this show?) Every time he sees a question mark, he says ""Look Mommy, Super Why!"" This DVD has played more times than I can count, and he of course knows all the songs, the sayings (""We look... in a book!""), the character names, and more. We have also discovered what time it airs on PBS Kids so we're now watching it live too. :)Super Why! Humpty Dumpty & Other Fairytale Adventures is filled with 100 minutes of problem solving adventures. Each of the four episodes is about a different popular fairytale and they change each story to help the character. For Humpty Dumpty, they help him down from the wall. He still gets a crack, but they put a bandaid on his boo boo so all is better. How cute is that? If you haven't seen Super Why! before, I highly recommend watching Super Why! Humpty Dumpty & Other Fairytale Adventures. I'm sure your child will love it as much as mine did (and still does!).",5,My son plays this DVD at least once per day,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,1086,"['receiving', 'Super', 'Why', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'Other', 'Fairytale', 'Adventures', 'son', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Super', 'Why', 'oh', 'goodness', 'now', 'officially', 'addicted', 'there', '12-step', 'program', 'show', 'Every', 'time', 'question', 'mark', 'Look', 'Mommy', 'Super', 'Why', 'DVD', 'played', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'course', 'songs', 'sayings', 'look', 'book', 'character', 'names', 'more', 'have', 'also', 'discovered', 'what', 'time', 'PBS', 'Kids', ""'re"", 'now', 'watching', 'live', 'too', 'Super', 'Why', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'Other', 'Fairytale', 'Adventures', 'filled', '100', 'minutes', 'problem', 'solving', 'adventures', 'four', 'episodes', 'different', 'popular', 'fairytale', 'change', 'story', 'help', 'character', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'help', 'down', 'wall', 'still', 'crack', 'put', 'bandaid', 'boo', 'boo', 'better', 'How', 'cute', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Super', 'Why', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Super', 'Why', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'Other', 'Fairytale', 'Adventures', ""'m"", 'sure', 'child', 'will', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'mine', 'did', 'still']",Super Why: Humpty Dumpty & Other Fairytale Adventures
