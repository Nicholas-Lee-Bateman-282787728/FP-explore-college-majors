This is truly an awful film.Clearly the screenwriter/Director needs to review some film school classes and pay attention this time. The script is so poor that the actors don't really have a chance. I'm not altogether sure that given a decent script they'd be much better but I do believe in the benefit of the doubt. Obviously shot with a small video camera sans dolly and with a very small pan ratio,the camera once placed in each set seems rooted there. The editing is at best abrupt.Lighting  by sun-guns.

1035374,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000KN7BMW,Grady Harp,"[0, 0]","Now and then we see early films by a well-trained and well-educated writer/director and enjoy the journey from amateur to professional status. Jorge Ameer has been actively and consistently making films since 2000 (with an earlier 1994 work) and it is therefore disappointing that he has not been able to garner financial backing to step beyond the low budget status that grounds his latest feature CONTADORA IS FOR LOVERS.  Why is that happening?For starters Ameer needs to assign the writing of his screenplays to others, find a competent cinematographer with the right equipment to step beyond the video state, and spend time with his actors in rehearsal and polish before the film is committed to the can.  This particular film demonstrates all of those flaws. The story - an engaged couple Mike (Vincent De Paul) and Maria (Christina Antelo) arrive on the off-Panama island of Contadora where they are warmly received by host Gabriel (Tony Sago) - has a good setup, but very quickly turns into an impractical love triangle with the bifurcated aspects of each character skipped over so quickly that the progress of the interrelationships just falls flat.  Gabriel is gay and manages to swoop Mike off for a hike on the island Gabriel 'knows like the back of his hand' only to 'get lost' and spend the night on the beach where some very rusty and insensitive  attempts to show attraction and rejection are shown.  Barely questioning the previous night's events Maria works back into the vacation and touches of ambiguity fizzle like water on hot rocks.  It seems Ameer wants to explore bisexuality but just doesn't understand the conflicts well enough to place words in the mouths of his actors.Each of the actors is attractive and at the beginning of the film there is hope that they can also act.  But the script and the filming and direction  prevent this little travelogue crew from sinking with the sunset.  Maybe next time....Grady Harp, March 07",3,Watching the dedication of Jorge Ameer,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,1955,"['Now', 'then', 'see', 'early', 'films', 'well-trained', 'well-educated', 'writer/director', 'enjoy', 'journey', 'amateur', 'professional', 'status', 'Jorge', 'Ameer', 'been', 'actively', 'consistently', 'making', 'films', '2000', 'earlier', '1994', 'work', 'therefore', 'disappointing', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'garner', 'financial', 'backing', 'step', 'low', 'budget', 'status', 'latest', 'feature', 'CONTADORA', 'IS', 'FOR', 'LOVERS', 'Why', 'happening', 'starters', 'Ameer', 'assign', 'writing', 'screenplays', 'others', 'find', 'competent', 'cinematographer', 'right', 'equipment', 'step', 'video', 'state', 'spend', 'time', 'actors', 'rehearsal', 'polish', 'film', 'committed', 'can', 'particular', 'film', 'flaws', 'story', 'engaged', 'couple', 'Mike', 'Vincent', 'De', 'Paul', 'Maria', 'Christina', 'Antelo', 'arrive', 'off-Panama', 'island', 'Contadora', 'where', 'are', 'warmly', 'received', 'host', 'Gabriel', 'Tony', 'Sago', 'good', 'setup', 'very', 'quickly', 'impractical', 'love', 'triangle', 'bifurcated', 'aspects', 'character', 'skipped', 'so', 'quickly', 'progress', 'interrelationships', 'just', 'flat', 'Gabriel', 'gay', 'swoop', 'Mike', 'off', 'hike', 'island', 'Gabriel', 'back', 'hand', 'only', ""'get"", 'lost', 'spend', 'night', 'beach', 'where', 'very', 'rusty', 'insensitive', 'attempts', 'show', 'attraction', 'rejection', 'are', 'shown', 'Barely', 'questioning', 'previous', 'night', 'events', 'Maria', 'back', 'vacation', 'touches', 'ambiguity', 'fizzle', 'water', 'hot', 'rocks', 'Ameer', 'explore', 'bisexuality', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'conflicts', 'well', 'enough', 'place', 'words', 'mouths', 'actors.Each', 'actors', 'attractive', 'beginning', 'film', 'hope', 'can', 'also', 'act', 'script', 'filming', 'direction', 'prevent', 'little', 'travelogue', 'crew', 'sinking', 'sunset', 'Maybe', 'next', 'time', '.Grady', 'Harp', 'March', '07']",Contadora Is for Lovers

They fall asleep on the beach in each other's arms and then the guy all the sudden wakes up and says ""How dare you!"" It's like WTF just happened?And then he goes back to the hotel room and tells his finance that he just had sex with the guide even though that didn't happen. uhh...?This movie could have used a lot of improvement.
