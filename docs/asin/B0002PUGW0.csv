And it's such fun!I love all three 'Yoga Dance' DVDs, and use them at least twice a week, either as a great warm up before a more intense workout or on days when I'm feeling lazy and don't feel like working too strenuously. However, once I start dancing with Sarina, I find myself wanting to dance and stretch all night long.The 'Fire' DVD contains three 21 minute workouts (which I think were initially made for television). Each workout is then divided into three segments - warm up (the longest segment and my favourite), the 'workout' section (which for me is only mildly aerobic and does not enter 'fat burning' territory) and cool down. I enjoy combining 2-3 warm up sections and doing all the stretches at the end. The three 'workout' sections are quite similar to each other, so I don't often combine these.Other reviewers have complained about the lack of yoga, yet this DVD contains lots of lovely stretches and balancing poses, and Sarina encourages you to breathe with the movements.",5,Something special,1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,1170,"['Sarina', 'fabulous', 'instructor', 'motivating', 'words', 'soothing', 'voice', 'together', 'wonderful', 'music', 'gorgeous', 'free-flowing', 'movements', 'make', 'joy', 'exercise', 'such', 'fun', 'love', 'three', ""'Yoga"", 'Dance', 'DVDs', 'use', 'least', 'twice', 'week', 'either', 'great', 'warm', 'up', 'more', 'intense', 'workout', 'days', 'when', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'lazy', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'working', 'too', 'strenuously', 'However', 'once', 'start', 'dancing', 'Sarina', 'find', 'wanting', 'dance', 'stretch', 'night', 'long.The', ""'Fire"", 'DVD', 'contains', 'three', '21', 'minute', 'workouts', 'think', 'were', 'initially', 'made', 'television', 'workout', 'then', 'divided', 'three', 'segments', 'warm', 'up', 'longest', 'segment', 'favourite', ""'workout"", 'section', 'only', 'mildly', 'aerobic', 'not', 'enter', ""'fat"", 'burning', 'territory', 'cool', 'down', 'enjoy', 'combining', '2-3', 'warm', 'sections', 'doing', 'stretches', 'end', 'three', 'sections', 'are', 'quite', 'similar', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'combine', 'these.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'lack', 'yoga', 'yet', 'DVD', 'lots', 'lovely', 'stretches', 'balancing', 'poses', 'Sarina', 'breathe', 'movements']",YOGA DANCE: FIRE
842838,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B0002PUGW0,C. Daly,"[26, 26]","I usually have trouble with dance steps (I am pretty uncoordinated), but I got most of Yoga Dance: Fire on the first try. I thought it was really fun to do. The instructor is a bit goofy and new age and some of the moves feel goofy also.  There is one when you are moving in circles with airplane arms that made me feel a bit self-conscious. What I really like is the instructor encourages you to just get into the music and add your own personal interpretation, which I did, and it seemed to come naturally. Overall the dance made me feel graceful and sexy, unlike most dance videos when I am tripping all over myself trying to get the steps right.  There is very little actual ""yoga"" except for the cool down. The dance is more of a fusion of different types of dance. I absolutely loved the music--some had a Latin flair, other parts sounded more Eastern. It's easy to dance when you have great music.I only gave the workout four stars because I feel it should have longer, more varied cardio sections.  Let me explain:  there are three separate sections, each one supposedly more difficult.  Each section is 20 minutes, including a warm up and a cool down.  So there is very little actual cardio in each section. It got my heart rate up, but I'm a beginning exerciser.  An advanced exerciser probably wouldn't be affected. Now you could combine the sections for an hour workout, but they are almost identical to one another.  I really don't see much of a difference, and it would seem boring to me to do virtually the same workout three times in a row.  So I just do one section at a time for a nice light cardio routine for time-pressed days. Or I combine it with some other kind of exercise--toning, walking, etc.",4,Enjoyable light cardio,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,1719,"['usually', 'have', 'trouble', 'dance', 'steps', 'am', 'pretty', 'uncoordinated', 'got', 'most', 'Yoga', 'Dance', 'Fire', 'first', 'try', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'do', 'instructor', 'bit', 'goofy', 'new', 'age', 'moves', 'feel', 'goofy', 'also', 'one', 'when', 'are', 'moving', 'circles', 'airplane', 'arms', 'made', 'feel', 'bit', 'self-conscious', 'What', 'really', 'like', 'instructor', 'just', 'get', 'music', 'add', 'own', 'personal', 'interpretation', 'did', 'seemed', 'come', 'naturally', 'Overall', 'dance', 'made', 'feel', 'graceful', 'sexy', 'most', 'dance', 'videos', 'when', 'am', 'tripping', 'trying', 'get', 'steps', 'right', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'yoga', 'cool', 'down', 'dance', 'more', 'fusion', 'different', 'types', 'dance', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'music', 'had', 'Latin', 'flair', 'other', 'parts', 'sounded', 'more', 'Eastern', 'easy', 'dance', 'when', 'have', 'great', 'music.I', 'only', 'gave', 'workout', 'four', 'stars', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'longer', 'more', 'varied', 'cardio', 'sections', 'Let', 'explain', 'are', 'three', 'separate', 'sections', 'one', 'supposedly', 'more', 'difficult', 'section', '20', 'minutes', 'including', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'cardio', 'section', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'exerciser', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'affected', 'Now', 'could', 'combine', 'sections', 'hour', 'workout', 'are', 'almost', 'identical', 'one', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'difference', 'would', 'seem', 'boring', 'do', 'virtually', 'same', 'workout', 'three', 'times', 'row', 'just', 'do', 'one', 'section', 'time', 'nice', 'light', 'cardio', 'routine', 'time-pressed', 'days', 'combine', 'other', 'kind', 'exercise', 'toning', 'walking', 'etc']",YOGA DANCE: FIRE
842839,A2F2DC94847JLP,B0002PUGW0,"Charlie Chaplin ""yogi285""","[12, 12]","I've done yoga for almost 30 years.  I've done tai chi for almost 10.  Aerobic dance for just about 20 years, and belly dance for probably 5 years.  I have exercise tapes of all kinds, even country line dancing.  To keep a variety going, I cycle through them, but have always yearned for one tape that combines my main loves -- yoga, tai chi, aerobics, belly dancing, and exotic dance.  This is it!  I've finally found it!  And, when they talk about global dances, they mean it.  On this tape, you learn and practice African, Latino, Brazilian, Indian, Spanish, and even a bit of Irish dance techniques.  Sarina blends them beautifully with the yoga, tai chi, aerobics and belly dance while really inspiring you by sharing her childlike joy in the music & body movement.  Nicely chosen music that neither drowns out her instructions nor is so quiet in the background that you can barely hear it.  It is just right, as is her voice and sweet way of instructing you.  There are warm-ups, workouts, and cool downs (3 of each) on the DVD.  Really, this is something for those at most levels of fitness and dance ability.  Start slow, make your movements not so big....then as you get used to the movements and get practiced, get as enthusiastic as she is.  I'm addicted to this one and the Earth one.  I have yet to try the Water one, but it is my next purchase.  :)I do agree that it is bothersome that each of the three segments contains a short warm-up, some work-out, and a brief cool down.  I usually hit the ""Play All"" and just go through the whole DVD.  I wish there was a way to slap all the work-outs together right in the middle, but I'm waiting for technology to get there so you can custom-create your own set-up.",5,I've been searching for something like this for years!,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,1721,"[""'ve"", 'done', 'yoga', 'almost', '30', 'years', ""'ve"", 'done', 'tai', 'chi', 'almost', '10', 'Aerobic', 'dance', 'just', '20', 'years', 'belly', 'dance', 'probably', '5', 'years', 'have', 'exercise', 'tapes', 'kinds', 'even', 'country', 'line', 'dancing', 'keep', 'variety', 'going', 'cycle', 'have', 'always', 'yearned', 'one', 'tape', 'combines', 'main', 'loves', 'yoga', 'tai', 'chi', 'aerobics', 'belly', 'dancing', 'exotic', 'dance', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'found', 'when', 'talk', 'global', 'dances', 'mean', 'tape', 'learn', 'practice', 'African', 'Latino', 'Brazilian', 'Indian', 'Spanish', 'even', 'bit', 'Irish', 'dance', 'techniques', 'Sarina', 'beautifully', 'yoga', 'tai', 'chi', 'aerobics', 'belly', 'dance', 'really', 'inspiring', 'sharing', 'childlike', 'joy', 'music', 'body', 'movement', 'Nicely', 'chosen', 'music', 'drowns', 'out', 'instructions', 'so', 'quiet', 'background', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'just', 'right', 'voice', 'sweet', 'way', 'instructing', 'are', 'warm-ups', 'workouts', 'cool', 'downs', '3', 'DVD', 'Really', 'something', 'most', 'levels', 'fitness', 'dance', 'ability', 'Start', 'slow', 'make', 'movements', 'not', 'so', 'big', '.then', 'get', 'used', 'movements', 'get', 'practiced', 'get', 'as', 'enthusiastic', ""'m"", 'addicted', 'one', 'Earth', 'one', 'have', 'yet', 'try', 'Water', 'one', 'next', 'purchase', 'do', 'agree', 'bothersome', 'three', 'segments', 'short', 'warm-up', 'work-out', 'brief', 'cool', 'down', 'usually', 'hit', 'Play', 'All', 'just', 'go', 'whole', 'DVD', 'wish', 'was', 'way', 'slap', 'work-outs', 'together', 'right', 'middle', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'technology', 'get', 'there', 'so', 'can', 'custom-create', 'own', 'set-up']",YOGA DANCE: FIRE
842840,A24K6CTE0YQPFL,B0002PUGW0,Cydni Perkins,"[16, 17]","this dvd consists of three seperate workouts entitled ""work up"", ""work in"", and ""work out"", getting progressively harder with each one.  Sarina is a nice instructor and she breaks down the movements very well.  choreography is fun, consisting of mainly flamenco/gypsy/brazilian dance moves during the cardio part, followed by yoga for the cool-down.  The focus in this workout is playfulness and fun, so Sarina stresses that everyone must perform the dance with their own unique flair - that's something I like.  No pressure to be perfect, but encouragement to be self-expressive instead.  Overall, a good video, especially if you're pressed for time.A word of warning:  unless you are an absolute beginner, meaning someone who has sat around for years without exercising, ""work up"" will not challenge you at all.  On the other hand, if you are a beginner, this will be excellent for you.  It's very easy and short - I did it on a ""light day"" and played it twice just to feel like I had done something.  And I'm not buff, folks.  I've been working out for all of 2 months.The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because the workouts are so brief.  But then, I'm not getting rid of it either, I'm saving it for days when I don't have much time.But one thing I really like about it is that all of the short workouts are on one dvd, instead of making lots of dvds with one short routine on each one.  That's something that bothers me about fitness dvds.  I feel like it's just an excuse to charge more money, and I'm glad this one is more sensible.",4,well done overall,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,1550,"['dvd', 'three', 'seperate', 'workouts', 'entitled', 'work', 'up', 'work', 'work', 'out', 'getting', 'progressively', 'harder', 'one', 'Sarina', 'nice', 'instructor', 'down', 'movements', 'very', 'well', 'choreography', 'fun', 'consisting', 'mainly', 'flamenco/gypsy/brazilian', 'dance', 'moves', 'cardio', 'part', 'followed', 'yoga', 'cool-down', 'focus', 'workout', 'playfulness', 'fun', 'Sarina', 'everyone', 'must', 'perform', 'dance', 'own', 'unique', 'flair', 'something', 'like', 'pressure', 'be', 'perfect', 'encouragement', 'be', 'self-expressive', 'instead', 'Overall', 'good', 'video', 'especially', ""'re"", 'pressed', 'time.A', 'word', 'warning', 'are', 'absolute', 'beginner', 'meaning', 'someone', 'who', 'sat', 'years', 'exercising', 'work', 'up', 'will', 'not', 'challenge', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'beginner', 'will', 'be', 'excellent', 'very', 'easy', 'short', 'did', 'light', 'day', 'played', 'twice', 'just', 'feel', 'had', 'done', 'something', ""'m"", 'not', 'buff', 'folks', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'out', '2', 'months.The', 'only', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'workouts', 'are', 'so', 'brief', 'then', ""'m"", 'not', 'getting', 'rid', ""'m"", 'saving', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'short', 'workouts', 'are', 'one', 'dvd', 'instead', 'making', 'lots', 'dvds', 'one', 'short', 'routine', 'one', 'something', 'bothers', 'fitness', 'dvds', 'feel', 'just', 'excuse', 'charge', 'more', 'money', ""'m"", 'glad', 'one', 'more', 'sensible']",YOGA DANCE: FIRE
842841,A1D807T2HQSMWX,B0002PUGW0,"Jessica Jones ""Dreamsenshi""","[5, 5]","I don't know much about Yoga, but there appears to be little Yoga in this DVD.  So, if you're looking for that specifically, you probably would want to look elsewhere.  After doing the exercises, I found that Sarina is a fun, kind-hearted person, and the DVD is fun and fast to get through.  There isn't real instruction on the dance moves, and you're encouraged to just enjoy yourself . . . which I do!  I find myself giggling at Sarina sometimes, because she's so free-spirited and it comes into the exercise.  It doesn't feel like you're working out because you're encouraged to have fun and just take care of yourself.I guess the only thing I can see most people having a problem with is that Sarina's silliness could be easily taken as being cheesy.  The majority of Americans who feel the need to be ""macho"" or serious would be uncomfortable using the DVD (that is, if anyone else knew they were watching it, or if the others that knew were ""macho"" or ""too serious"" for this kind of thing).  However, if you enjoy actually relaxing through working out instead of feeling like you're exercising the whole time, this is a good one!As far as impact goes, there are a few moves that require jumping, but as Sarina says in the DVD, you can listen to your body and easily adjust the moves to your body's needs and easily avoid any impact to your knees or feet.  That makes the work outs pretty much good for all ages, I think.  There are three work outs on the DVD, and I think they are probably 20-minutes each, but I honestly didn't check the time because I was enjoying myself.",4,"Easy, fun.. so SILLY",1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,1580,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Yoga', 'there', 'be', 'little', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'specifically', 'probably', 'would', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'doing', 'exercises', 'found', 'Sarina', 'fun', 'kind-hearted', 'person', 'DVD', 'fun', 'fast', 'get', ""n't"", 'real', 'instruction', 'dance', 'moves', ""'re"", 'encouraged', 'just', 'enjoy', 'do', 'find', 'giggling', 'Sarina', 'sometimes', 'so', 'free-spirited', 'exercise', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'working', 'out', ""'re"", 'encouraged', 'have', 'fun', 'just', 'take', 'care', 'yourself.I', 'guess', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'see', 'most', 'people', 'having', 'problem', 'Sarina', 'silliness', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'taken', 'being', 'cheesy', 'majority', 'Americans', 'who', 'feel', 'need', 'be', 'macho', 'serious', 'would', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'using', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'else', 'knew', 'were', 'watching', 'others', 'knew', 'were', 'macho', 'too', 'serious', 'kind', 'thing', 'However', 'enjoy', 'actually', 'relaxing', 'working', 'out', 'instead', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'exercising', 'whole', 'time', 'good', 'one', 'As', 'far', 'impact', 'are', 'few', 'moves', 'require', 'jumping', 'Sarina', 'DVD', 'can', 'listen', 'body', 'easily', 'adjust', 'moves', 'body', 'needs', 'easily', 'avoid', 'impact', 'knees', 'feet', 'work', 'pretty', 'much', 'good', 'ages', 'think', 'are', 'three', 'work', 'outs', 'DVD', 'think', 'are', 'probably', '20-minutes', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'time', 'was', 'enjoying']",YOGA DANCE: FIRE
