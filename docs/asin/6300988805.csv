241562,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6300988805,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 1]","I must admit, this film was brilliant.  I have never been so captivated by such powerful acting, intense storytelling, and such beautiful landscapes ... all created in the 1940s.  The work that I witnessed in this film could rival that of most modern films today.  For once, the acting was perfection.  David Lean, the director, has this direct sense of finding the best actors for the roles.  It is as if the actors really want to embody their characters.  This was an acting driven film.  Without strong players, I don't think it would have had such a big impact on me, but everyone involved surprised me.  From the larger roles like Pip played by John Mills (flopsy, but filled with charisma and charm), to the smaller roles like Miss Havisham (Martita Hunt) and Mr. Jaggers (brilliant portrayal by Francis L. Sullivan), everyone seemed in tune, prepared, and excited about their part in Lean's masterpiece.  You just don't see acting like this anymore.  My mind's eye, from reading the books, seemed to even been excited by what they saw.  It was nearly as if Lean was reading my mind and casting accordingly.  It was impressive, honestly, to say the least.From my previous adventures into Lean's work with Brief Encounter (a personal favorite of mine) and Blithe Spirit (another immaculate tale), I knew he could tackle the voluptuous story of Great Expectations, but what I wasn't prepared for was the gorgeous scenery and ability to capture the sensation of the film.  For many directors today, the lack of proper cinematography can sometimes ruin the themes or feelings of a film, and even sometimes disrupt the power of the actors, but for Lean this was no problem.  His eye for filmmaking is unmatched, and his ability to create is on of Hollywood's greatest treats.  Lean has this power to pull the right people, the best scenes (even with a black and white structure), and create the most intense themes that will continue to pull you deeper into a picture that you may think that you are not going to enjoy.  There has yet to be one David Lean film that I have found distracting or below par.  Lean's passion for creation is obvious with the work that he has done, which I think was rather visionary for the time.  You can see it in Brief Encounter, and you can especially see it in this film.  I cannot speak any higher of Lean because his work speaks for him.  If you want to see cinema in its best form, I always suggest a David Lean film.Finally, this film's structure was exactly what this story needed.  While I will agree that it is a love story (and future adaptations would say it was more of a love story than anything else), Lean transformed it more into a story of discovery.  This is a story about Pip, and his ability to be a person that many of us long to be.  While some would have fled in the sight of an escaped convict, or at least turned them into the police, you see a very humble human going beyond that and reaching out his timid hand to help.  This is what will change Pip forever.  Even if we think we are going to loose that person throughout the film (when money enters the picture), we eventually see that Pip's honesty is true.  Lean develops more of a relationship between Magwitch and Pip than he does Pip and Estella.  This worked perfectly for me, because it allowed me to see Pip for who he was, and the heart that he had developed.  While I am very happy with the ending to this film, the direction that Lean pushed us was perfect.  The balance was never tipped and our foundation never broke, a rarity in cinema today.Overall, I was more than impressed with this film.  David Lean continues to prove that he was a formidable director at his time, and I cannot wait to immerse myself in more of his work.  This film wasn't just about Lean though, it was the actors that carried it and built such a solid story.  The reason this movie is so enjoyable to watch is because you don't see the actors, but instead the characters that they represent.  They carry this film on their shoulders and never let it fall or slip.  Whether you have read the story a million times or just once, or even never, this is a film that will capture your attention and excite your mind.  I read a review that stated it was ""intelligent"", and I couldn't agree more.  Lean forces you to think and commands your attention.  I just wish more films were made like this today.  If I could have experienced cinema in the 1940s, I think I would have been a very happy man!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"Keep still, you young devil, or I'll slit your throat!",1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,4514,"['must', 'admit', 'film', 'was', 'brilliant', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'captivated', 'such', 'powerful', 'acting', 'intense', 'storytelling', 'such', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'created', '1940s', 'work', 'witnessed', 'film', 'could', 'rival', 'most', 'modern', 'films', 'today', 'once', 'acting', 'was', 'perfection', 'David', 'Lean', 'director', 'direct', 'sense', 'finding', 'best', 'actors', 'roles', 'actors', 'really', 'want', 'embody', 'characters', 'was', 'acting', 'driven', 'film', 'strong', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'big', 'impact', 'everyone', 'involved', 'surprised', 'larger', 'roles', 'Pip', 'played', 'John', 'Mills', 'flopsy', 'filled', 'charisma', 'charm', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'Martita', 'Hunt', 'Mr.', 'Jaggers', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Francis', 'L.', 'Sullivan', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'tune', 'prepared', 'excited', 'part', 'Lean', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'acting', 'anymore', 'mind', 'eye', 'reading', 'books', 'seemed', 'even', 'been', 'excited', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'Lean', 'was', 'reading', 'mind', 'casting', 'accordingly', 'was', 'impressive', 'honestly', 'say', 'least.From', 'previous', 'adventures', 'Lean', 'work', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Blithe', 'Spirit', 'immaculate', 'tale', 'knew', 'could', 'tackle', 'voluptuous', 'story', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'ability', 'capture', 'sensation', 'film', 'many', 'directors', 'today', 'lack', 'proper', 'cinematography', 'can', 'sometimes', 'ruin', 'themes', 'feelings', 'film', 'even', 'sometimes', 'disrupt', 'power', 'actors', 'Lean', 'was', 'problem', 'eye', 'filmmaking', 'unmatched', 'ability', 'create', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'treats', 'Lean', 'power', 'pull', 'right', 'people', 'best', 'scenes', 'even', 'black', 'white', 'structure', 'create', 'most', 'intense', 'themes', 'will', 'continue', 'pull', 'deeper', 'picture', 'may', 'think', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'enjoy', 'yet', 'be', 'one', 'David', 'Lean', 'film', 'have', 'found', 'distracting', 'par', 'Lean', 'passion', 'creation', 'obvious', 'work', 'done', 'think', 'was', 'rather', 'visionary', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'can', 'especially', 'see', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'higher', 'Lean', 'work', 'speaks', 'want', 'see', 'cinema', 'best', 'form', 'always', 'suggest', 'David', 'Lean', 'film.Finally', 'film', 'structure', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'story', 'needed', 'will', 'agree', 'love', 'story', 'future', 'adaptations', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'anything', 'else', 'Lean', 'transformed', 'more', 'story', 'discovery', 'story', 'Pip', 'ability', 'be', 'person', 'many', 'long', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'fled', 'sight', 'escaped', 'convict', 'least', 'turned', 'police', 'see', 'very', 'humble', 'human', 'going', 'reaching', 'out', 'timid', 'hand', 'help', 'what', 'will', 'change', 'Pip', 'forever', 'Even', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'loose', 'person', 'film', 'when', 'money', 'picture', 'eventually', 'see', 'Pip', 'honesty', 'true', 'Lean', 'more', 'relationship', 'Magwitch', 'Pip', 'Pip', 'Estella', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'allowed', 'see', 'Pip', 'who', 'was', 'heart', 'had', 'developed', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'ending', 'film', 'direction', 'Lean', 'pushed', 'was', 'perfect', 'balance', 'was', 'never', 'tipped', 'foundation', 'never', 'broke', 'rarity', 'cinema', 'today.Overall', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'film', 'David', 'Lean', 'prove', 'was', 'formidable', 'director', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'immerse', 'more', 'work', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'Lean', 'was', 'actors', 'carried', 'built', 'solid', 'story', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'actors', 'instead', 'characters', 'represent', 'carry', 'film', 'shoulders', 'never', 'let', 'fall', 'slip', 'Whether', 'have', 'read', 'story', 'million', 'times', 'just', 'once', 'even', 'never', 'film', 'will', 'capture', 'attention', 'excite', 'mind', 'read', 'review', 'stated', 'was', 'intelligent', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', 'Lean', 'forces', 'think', 'commands', 'attention', 'just', 'wish', 'more', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'today', 'could', 'have', 'experienced', 'cinema', '1940s', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'happy', 'man', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",Great Expectations VHS

241567,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,6300988805,Classic Movie watcher,"[7, 7]","Having watched the classic movies Great Expectations (David Lean) and David Copperfield (George Cukor) recently, I found Great Expectations an unparalled adaptation of the Dickens story - both in terms of the mastery of storytelling, cinematography and more importantly the unbeatable cast of characters.I first watched Great Expectations as a child on a small TV, the only face I could remember was Jean Simmons (16 years old) as the young Estella leading young Pip around Ms Havisham's house. Now as I watched the movie again on DVD, there was young Pip whose distinguished performance would still stand out nowadays. The heartbroken but still beautiful Ms Havisham, Pip's honest brother-in-law, his faithful friend Mr. Pocket (Alec Guiness) all are a delight to watch. Yet the best acts must go to the shrew and careful lawyer Mr. Jaggers, whose diaglogue with Pip on legal terms were impressive, and Pip's benefactor - a convict exiled to Australia, his face was unforgettable and his voice revealed a lonely heart.Though many movie adaptations of classics, by Shakespeare and Dickens and the likes, are produced over the years, this 1946 adaptation is worth watching again and is not a bit dated. The B&W; cinematography, actors in the 40s, old houses, deserted marshlands, a rare glimpse of a steam boat and a distant shot of the gallows have added a natural, nostalgic feel to the movie and created a convincing portrait of a story about a long time ago.",5,Great cast and storytelling,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,1461,"['Having', 'watched', 'classic', 'movies', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'David', 'Lean', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'George', 'Cukor', 'recently', 'found', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'unparalled', 'adaptation', 'Dickens', 'story', 'terms', 'mastery', 'storytelling', 'cinematography', 'more', 'importantly', 'unbeatable', 'cast', 'characters.I', 'first', 'watched', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'child', 'small', 'TV', 'only', 'face', 'could', 'remember', 'was', 'Jean', 'Simmons', '16', 'years', 'old', 'young', 'Estella', 'leading', 'young', 'Pip', 'Ms', 'Havisham', 'house', 'Now', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'DVD', 'was', 'young', 'Pip', 'distinguished', 'performance', 'would', 'still', 'stand', 'out', 'nowadays', 'heartbroken', 'still', 'beautiful', 'Ms', 'Havisham', 'Pip', 'honest', 'brother-in-law', 'faithful', 'friend', 'Mr.', 'Pocket', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'are', 'delight', 'watch', 'best', 'acts', 'must', 'go', 'shrew', 'careful', 'lawyer', 'Mr.', 'Jaggers', 'diaglogue', 'Pip', 'legal', 'terms', 'were', 'impressive', 'Pip', 'benefactor', 'convict', 'exiled', 'Australia', 'face', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'voice', 'revealed', 'lonely', 'heart.Though', 'many', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'classics', 'Shakespeare', 'Dickens', 'likes', 'are', 'produced', 'years', '1946', 'adaptation', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'not', 'bit', 'dated', 'B', 'W', 'cinematography', 'actors', '40s', 'old', 'houses', 'deserted', 'marshlands', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'steam', 'boat', 'distant', 'shot', 'gallows', 'have', 'added', 'natural', 'nostalgic', 'feel', 'movie', 'created', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'story', 'long', 'time', 'ago']",Great Expectations VHS

DeRiemer,"[25, 26]","If a movie ever captured better the look in your head of a book you've read than David Lean's Great Expectations, I don't know what it would be. From the moment young Pip is seen running along the marsh road to the deserted cemetery and his encounter with the escaped convict, Magwitch (scaring Pip as well as us half to death) to Pip the young man ripping down the dust-laden, moldering drapes in Miss Havisham's decaying mansion and letting the daylight in, we see what we imagined, and it's just about perfect.Great Expectations is one of Charles Dickens' greatest novels, and the movie, in my opinion, is David Lean's greatest accomplishment as a director. You'd have to be a cynic not to be captured by this story of a young, poor boy, an orphan raised in a blacksmith's home by his sister and her husband, who unexpectedly becomes a young gentleman of great expectations.Lean chose actors who bring the characters vividly to life. Pip (John Mills) is a young man who has become self-satisfied with the mysterious funds he receives that have enabled him to become a gentleman. In time, however, he realizes ""that in becoming a gentleman, I had only succeeded in becoming a snob."" But Pip's innate honesty and humanity come through as he accepts the debt he owes to his benefactor and faces the love he has for Estella. Jean Simmons as young Estella and Valerie Hobson as Estella the woman are beautiful and cruel, as Estella was raised to be by Miss Havisham. Francis L. Sullivan is perfect as the large, shrewd lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who knows all the secrets. Miss Havisham is played by Martita Hunt. Miss Havisham was abandoned on her wedding day years before. She has retreated into bitterness, living within her mansion as if time at stopped, the draperies closed, still wearing her wedding dress, cobwebs festooning the rooms and the banquet table still fully set, bearing what remains of the bride's cake. She will see to it that men, through Estella, will suffer as she suffered. Finlay Currie is Magwitch, the tough, hulking convict who was unexpectedly touched by young Pip bringing him food. Alec Guinness is Herbert Pocket, good natured, energetic and a true friend.At the end of the story, Pip and Estella realize they will have great expectations together. There is sadness, happiness, redemption, regret and love. Most off all, there are these marvelous characters in a great story.The Criterion DVD looks fine. There are no significant extras.

241571,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6300988805,Craig Connell,"[2, 3]","As I watched the beginning of this film, I couldn't help but compare the story to the only other Charles Dickens story I was familiar with: Oliver Twist. It looked like it was going to be another story of a nice, respectful boy being abused by nasty adults. However, as soon as the young boy turned into a man, the similarities ended. Poor Oliver had a lot of ups and downs but life was basically pretty good for the boy, ""Pip"" in ""Great Expectations."" Because of that, I didn't think this Dickens tale had the emotional impact of Oliver Twist, but still was great storytelling. The last 20-30 minutes of this film tied so many things together it really made it a satisfying film. From what I just researched, it sounds like the book was a lot harsher story.John Mills looked way too old to be playing a 20-year-old ""Pip Pirrip."" In truth, he was too old. Mills was 38 when doing this role. At any rate, I enjoyed a number of actors in here, mainly three older ones: Martita Hunt, Findlay Currie and Francis L. Sullivan. Hunt was just great as ""Miss Haversham."" I found her fascinating in every sentence she delivered, all of which she did while just sitting in a chair. Currie was genuinely frightening in the beginning as the escaped convict ""Magwitch."" However, what a transformation that man made in this story! Francis L. Sullivan emotes convincingly enough to play theTo me, the acting took a back seat to Dickens' story and to the film's cinematography. Knowing David Lean directed this film, that Criterion usually produces nice-looking DVD transfers and that ""Oliver Twist"" looked fantastic on disc, I was paying as close attention to the cinematography, and I enjoyed it. The story wasn't that intense until the finale, which was very well done. Even though the screenplay is softer than the novel, most people say it still captures Dickens' flavor, and few critics had anything but praise for this classic film.  Lean and cinematographer Guy Green won Oscars for their work here, so you know it's not too shabby.The combination of Dickens, Lean, Green and a fine cast all make this a classic movie that is certainly recommended.

Sullivan as the lawyer Jagger (whose clients are hanged as a matter of course), Finlay Curry as the convict Magwitch, and Alec Guinness as Herbert Pocket--is pitch-perfect (although I always thought the excellent Valerie Hobson was a bit of a disappointment after the brittle hauteur of Jean Simmons).This film has everything: humor, suspense, and a lack of the sentimentality that seems to have crept into Dickensian films of late.Lean, who was to become famous for his sweeping desolate landscapes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Dr. Zhivago,"" captures the essence of the lonely English fog-bound marshes with swirling swathes of grey in this glorious black and white film. The image of young Estella (a bewitching Jean Simmons) leading young Pip by candlelight up the darkened staircase into the cobweb-enshrouded inner sanctum of the demented Miss Havisham (the incomparable Martita Hunt), is unforgettable, as is the sight of the jilted bride's rat-infested wedding cake.

Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOWFamed film director David Lean offers us a starkly fearless adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel ""Great Expectations.""  Tonally very similar to its source material, it is also surprising in its sturdy execution, holding up very nicely to contemporary scrutiny.It is cast with some of the best British actors of the period, from Bernard Miles as Joe Gargery to Francis L. Sullivan as Mr. Jaggers.  In a natural and wonderful performance, Anthony Wager shines as the child Pip, even outdoing his mature counterpart Sir John Mills as the adult Pip.  Mr. Mills is passable but oddly colorless and out of place here.  Being paired with the incomparable Sir Alec Guinness for much of the second half of the picture does not do him any favors.  Mr. Guinness is Herbert Pocket, the varnished human symbol of Pip's hopes for material success and he plays the part superbly.  Additionally, Jean Simmons and Martita Hunt give timeless performances as the child Estella and the haunted crone Miss Havisham, respectively.  Ms. Simmons' performance is perfect and makes the viewer wish that the mature iteration of Estella had been handled better.  Much like Sir John Mills, Valerie Hobson's character is undercut by timid writing which diminishes the extent of Estella's romantic danger to Pip.  Martita Hunt expertly walks the line between caricature and realism in her depiction.  Ultimately, she comes off very demented and her slow line delivery mimics the slow speech of someone who is dying.This is a mature movie which has true potential to give children nightmares.  Despite Dickens' reputation as an author who has spawned many family-friendly adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol,""  parents of inquisitive children regarding his other works should screen this prior to letting their children see it.Despite the few complaints I've outlined, this is a superb movie which deserves to be watched for true entertainment value and studied in film schools to the present day.",5,This is still the classic standard film of arguably Dickens' finest novel,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,1978,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWFamed', 'film', 'director', 'David', 'Lean', 'starkly', 'fearless', 'adaptation', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'Tonally', 'very', 'similar', 'source', 'material', 'also', 'surprising', 'sturdy', 'execution', 'holding', 'up', 'very', 'nicely', 'contemporary', 'scrutiny.It', 'cast', 'best', 'British', 'actors', 'period', 'Bernard', 'Miles', 'Joe', 'Gargery', 'Francis', 'L.', 'Sullivan', 'Mr.', 'Jaggers', 'natural', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Anthony', 'Wager', 'shines', 'child', 'Pip', 'even', 'outdoing', 'mature', 'counterpart', 'Sir', 'John', 'Mills', 'adult', 'Pip', 'Mr.', 'Mills', 'passable', 'oddly', 'colorless', 'place', 'here', 'Being', 'paired', 'incomparable', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'much', 'second', 'half', 'picture', 'not', 'do', 'favors', 'Mr.', 'Guinness', 'Herbert', 'Pocket', 'varnished', 'human', 'symbol', 'Pip', 'hopes', 'material', 'success', 'part', 'superbly', 'Additionally', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Martita', 'Hunt', 'give', 'timeless', 'performances', 'child', 'Estella', 'haunted', 'crone', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'respectively', 'Ms.', 'Simmons', 'performance', 'perfect', 'viewer', 'wish', 'mature', 'iteration', 'Estella', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'Much', 'Sir', 'John', 'Mills', 'Valerie', 'Hobson', 'character', 'undercut', 'timid', 'writing', 'extent', 'Estella', 'romantic', 'danger', 'Pip', 'Martita', 'Hunt', 'expertly', 'line', 'caricature', 'realism', 'depiction', 'Ultimately', 'off', 'very', 'demented', 'slow', 'line', 'delivery', 'mimics', 'slow', 'speech', 'someone', 'who', 'dying.This', 'mature', 'movie', 'true', 'potential', 'give', 'children', 'nightmares', 'Dickens', 'reputation', 'author', 'who', 'spawned', 'many', 'family-friendly', 'adaptations', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'parents', 'inquisitive', 'children', 'regarding', 'other', 'works', 'should', 'screen', 'prior', 'letting', 'children', 'see', 'few', 'complaints', ""'ve"", 'outlined', 'superb', 'movie', 'be', 'watched', 'true', 'entertainment', 'value', 'studied', 'film', 'schools', 'present', 'day']",Great Expectations VHS

I hadn't seen it since it appeared on Bravo in the 1980s, so I was very excited when I recently bought it at half price during a Criterion Collection sale. The early scenes of Pip's extraordinary encounter with the prisoner Magwich, family life with his shrewish sister and gentle Joe, and Pip's visits to see Miss Havisham and Estella still grab me in my movie bones. Lean's incredible facility for atmosphere in the foggy English moors, the rotting ship hulks, the graveyard, and Miss Havisham's dreary mansion are still magical. But when Pip grows up, moves to London, and becomes John Mills, the atmosphere recedes, the delightful performance by the actor playing young Pip is of course gone, and Pip's foppish attempts at social climbing are almost too embarrassing to watch.

241583,A2WJSVSBXEYEF,6300988805,Jefferson T. Packer,"[15, 17]","I should mention first that this is the only film version of ""Great Expectations"" that I have ever seen.  There may be better ones, but I'm only qualified to talk about this one.My 10th graders were spellbound by this film.  They saw it on a big screen from an Epson 720p projector with big stereo sound, which probably helped.  However, their reaction to it really surprised me.  From the first frame they were rapt, and it turned into one of their favorite experiences of the year.David Lean's brilliant cinematography is partly responsible for this - the lighting and composition are absolutely stupendous.  Many people talk about the ""possibilities"" of black and white, but David Lean delivers them.  The film is visually stunning.The film also does a decent, if not perfect, job of following the book; obviously some scenes needed to be shortened or left out entirely or this would have been a five hour film.  It is not so accurate that you can read a chapter and then watch it, but it is accurate enough that it is certainly worth showing as a reward for finishing the book.I withhold the fifth star only because the actresses who play young Estella and ""grown woman"" Estella are so jarringly different as to be almost impossible to accept as the same character.  For instance, young Estella seems to have a nose from Sweden, while grown Estella's nose seems to hail from somewhere near Rome.  The actresses just aren't similar enough to sustain even the most willing suspension of disbelief.The actress who plays Miss Havisham, however, is utterly perfect, and her whole broken-hearted domain is reproduced exactly as I imagined it from the book, right down to the mouse-gnawed, spider-infested wedding cake.  Her 25 year-long tantrum is shown as half-hilarious, half-horrifying, which is exactly as Dickens intended it in my opinion, and the actress captures the perfect blend of nuances in portraying this unique character as perfectly as she could be portrayed.The rest of the characters are quite well done also, including the attorney, Pip's sister, Joe and the ""pale young gentleman.""  Even the clerk with ""The Aged"" father is well played, although the tour of his castle-house from the book is absent.  Pip himself is portrayed very appropriately by both the young and older actors, and never disappoints.Along with the characters, the film provides an incredible amount of tantalizing 19th century detail, enough to keep even the sleepiest, most sullen student awake at 8:02 am on a cold winter morning.  All in all, well worth the $35 asking price, especially because, like all Criterion titles in my experience, the DVD transfer looks and sounds absolutely beautiful.",4,An English Teacher's Review,1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,2685,"['should', 'mention', 'first', 'only', 'film', 'version', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'ones', ""'m"", 'only', 'qualified', 'talk', 'one.My', '10th', 'graders', 'were', 'spellbound', 'film', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'Epson', '720p', 'projector', 'big', 'stereo', 'sound', 'probably', 'helped', 'However', 'reaction', 'really', 'surprised', 'first', 'frame', 'were', 'rapt', 'turned', 'one', 'favorite', 'experiences', 'year.David', 'Lean', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'partly', 'responsible', 'lighting', 'composition', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stupendous', 'Many', 'people', 'talk', 'possibilities', 'black', 'white', 'David', 'Lean', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning.The', 'film', 'also', 'decent', 'not', 'perfect', 'job', 'following', 'book', 'obviously', 'scenes', 'needed', 'be', 'shortened', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'five', 'hour', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'accurate', 'can', 'read', 'chapter', 'then', 'watch', 'accurate', 'enough', 'certainly', 'worth', 'showing', 'reward', 'finishing', 'book.I', 'withhold', 'fifth', 'star', 'only', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'young', 'Estella', 'grown', 'woman', 'Estella', 'are', 'so', 'jarringly', 'different', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'accept', 'same', 'character', 'instance', 'young', 'Estella', 'have', 'nose', 'Sweden', 'grown', 'Estella', 'nose', 'hail', 'somewhere', 'Rome', 'actresses', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'similar', 'enough', 'sustain', 'even', 'most', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief.The', 'actress', 'who', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'however', 'utterly', 'perfect', 'whole', 'broken-hearted', 'domain', 'reproduced', 'exactly', 'imagined', 'book', 'right', 'down', 'mouse-gnawed', 'spider-infested', 'wedding', 'cake', '25', 'year-long', 'tantrum', 'shown', 'half-hilarious', 'half-horrifying', 'exactly', 'Dickens', 'intended', 'opinion', 'actress', 'perfect', 'blend', 'nuances', 'portraying', 'unique', 'character', 'as', 'perfectly', 'could', 'be', 'portrayed.The', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'including', 'attorney', 'Pip', 'sister', 'Joe', 'pale', 'young', 'gentleman', 'Even', 'clerk', 'Aged', 'father', 'well', 'played', 'tour', 'castle-house', 'book', 'absent', 'Pip', 'portrayed', 'very', 'appropriately', 'young', 'older', 'actors', 'never', 'disappoints.Along', 'characters', 'film', 'incredible', 'amount', 'tantalizing', '19th', 'century', 'detail', 'enough', 'keep', 'even', 'sleepiest', 'most', 'sullen', 'student', 'awake', '8:02', 'am', 'cold', 'winter', 'morning', 'well', '35', 'asking', 'price', 'especially', 'Criterion', 'titles', 'experience', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'absolutely', 'beautiful']",Great Expectations VHS

This film was directed by David Lean, and I prefer it because the fact that it's in black & white is part of the atmosphere and mood, when Pip was growing up, some of the experiences he went through were rather grim.

241585,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,6300988805,Jeremy Storly,"[4, 6]","First, a word of warning to the modern viewer: If you are the type of viewer who cannot stand the overacting, dramatically altered 'Hollywood' ending, and absurdly ostentatious soundtrack score inherent to any film released in the 1940s, you may choose to look elsewhere for an adaptation of Dickens.If, however, you are able to accept the limitations and imperfections of the decade in which this was created, you will see a beautifully filmed masterpiece. Some of the camera work in this work is incredible. The director shows a sensitivity to setting and mood unparalleled in any other adaptation of 'Great Expectations'.  Even some of the acting is brilliant, especially Alec Guiness's role as Herbert Pocket.Diehard fans of Dickens, especially those familiar with the controversy over Dickens's two endings, will bemoan the way in which the ending is slaughtered in a way Dickens would have never allowed or considered. This, however, may be easily remedied by stopping the movie five minutes before it ends. Or one can grit one's teeth and endure it.The film is also too short. Many of the best scenes from the novel have been cut, and the actors and actresses often seem rushed, which is a shame, since this makes it pretty much impossible to tackle the nuances of the novel's plot. Classic Hollywood apparently had four hours to spare on a movie defending the racist South, but not much time for Dickens.All complaints aside, however, this is not bad. I have watched it twice since I received it three weeks ago, and I would recommend it, though certainly not as warmly as many of the other viewers. Superior versions have been made since.

Thompson,"[1, 2]","Dickens' tale of an abused orphan gets a deluxe production here with lively direction by David Lean, a shapely script by, among others, Anthony Havelock-Allan, some splendid performances (& a few clinkers as well) which is all served up in glorious Black & White by Guy Green,  The first part is so good it carries you through the somewhat disappointing second part.  The opening in the churchyard where Pip meets the escaped convict Magwitch (Finlay Currie) is so expertly staged it's thrilling & you can't wait to see what happens next.  Soon Pip is employed by an eccentric lady who has a fancy to see him 'play'.  She was betrayed & abandoned years earlier on her wedding day &, for her, time stopped that same moment.  In her great moldering house Pip meets the ward, Estella, who is being schooled to be a heart breaker of men.  Later a mysterious benefactor makes Pip a young person of great expectations & he is off to London for a new life, more adventures & perhaps discover the identity of his patron.  Anthony Wager is wonderful as the young Pip.  He doesn't have the creepy precociousness of some Hollywood child stars of the era.  His vulnerability is part of his appeal.  When John Mills takes over the part you understand what he is trying to do; play the part of a young man who doesn't know what to do with his new wealth, how to wear his new clothes or dine on strange foods with his new friends.  Play the part of a young man with no confidence.  Unfortunately Mills' performance has no confidence either.  Freda Jackson is his abusive sister with whom he lives along with his brother-in-law (Bernard Miles who showed up the next year as Newman Noggs in Cavalconti's NICHOLAS NICKLEBY).  Martita Hunt is the Miss Havisham you always wanted to see.  She gives a superb demonstration of how less is more.  Jean Simmons is luminous as Estella.  According to James Agee she is the first British actor to come to acting solely from the movies.  What she does here would be astonishing from anyone but from a teenager it's jaw dropping.  When Valerie Hobson takes over the role it's like going from Being to Nothingness.  John Forrest is young Herbert Pocket & when he morphs into Alec Guinness they are so perfectly matched you may find yourself grinning.  Francis L. Sullivan is Mr Jaggers forever.A word of caution:  The character Pip's sister is so verbally & physically abusive that perhaps her scenes are unsuitable for children & young teens.

241593,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6300988805,Linda Linguvic,"[79, 82]","An Academy Award winner for Best Art and Set Direction and Best Cinematography in a black and white film, this 1947 version of the classic Dickens novel was adapted for the screen by British director David Lean.  I can understand why it won those awards.  Without the availability of modern technical effects, he was able to create a perfect atmosphere and sense of foreboding, keeping the mood and dark macabre feeling of the novel throughout.  He also kept some key scenes intact, the young Pip's meeting with the convict, the mad Miss Havisham, and the ghoulish atmosphere in the law offices of Mr. Jaggers, whose walls are decorated with the death masks of clients he had lost to the gallows.In most respects, this film stayed true to the novel.  But it is impossible to condense Dickens into a spare two-hour film.  Perhaps it was because I had just finished the novel the day before, but I couldn't help but notice how some characters were missing, many scenes were eliminated, the ending was changed and the plot seemed an oversimplification of the one I had just lived with in the book for the past month.Without exception, all of the actors were excellent, but I wondered a bit at the casting.  John Mills played the young pip who was supposed to be 20.  In reality, he was 38 years old at the time and, in those days before plastic surgery, even had some crows feet around his eyes.  Alex Guinness, who was cast as Herbert Pocket who befriends the adult Pip, was actually 32 and both of these gentlemen just didn't have the  freshness of youth that was so apparent in the Dickens novel.Age didn't seem to matter though in the casting of the convict. Finlay Currie, with his craggy face and threatening bearing was 68, but he played the role as if it was created just for him.  Jean Simmons played the young Estella, her performance overshadowing that of Valerie Hopson who was cast as the older Estella.  Marita Hunt played Miss Havisham, exactly as I had pictured her in my mind's eye.  And Francis L. Sullivan's gave a perfect portrayal of the lawyer Jaggers.Perhaps if I had let several decades pass between my reading of the book and my viewing of the film, the edges would have softened on my memory and I would have not been as critical.  The film was really good and a great way to experience Dickens through this director's interpretation of his work. It certainly is a wonderful story and  I've noticed from a bit of research on the Net that there are nine movie versions, three TV programs and four TV series.

Great Expectations is one that students often have to read in high school and it can be tough going.  I learned to love Great Expectations through this film.  David Lean brings out the story in a wonderful way and makes the story clear and meaningful.  Both Pip and Estella are born from low beginnings and then brought up to be a gentleman and a lady.  Their relationship to the status is based on money and connections.  When the money and connections become tenuous, they are laid waste again.  To their benefit?  Maybe.  Great Expectations is a story of hope and social mobility in a society that has little of hope or social mobility.  It is a story in which all members dream of it tenuously while trying to ignore their circumstances and birth.

241598,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6300988805,Martin Asiner,"[43, 45]","It has never been easy to tranfer Dickens from the printed page to the moving screen.  His plots are all too often multi-layered, containing what today's readers might think of as an excessive number of characters.  Nevertheless, the very best filmed adaptations still retain enough of the flavor of the original to keep the movie's actions on line.  Director David Lean in GREAT EXPECTATIONS has created a moody, black and white period piece that perfectly captures the essence of how a young and fearful boy sees his bleak surroundings.  This element of bleakness, so evident in most of Dickens, is especially prominent here, both externally in the grim, forbidding exteriors of the graveyard that introduces the film and internally in the myriad of blows that buffet young Pip (Anthony Wager) for nearly the entire film.  As was common for most of his child heroes, Dickens gave them a juvenile view of a universe that was inhospitable for them.  Adults were often unpredicatable and cruel in a manner than resonates even today.  Young Pip sees terror nearly everywhere.  The escaped criminal, Magwitch (Finlay Currie), his elder sister Mrs. Gargery (Freda Jackson), and the weirdly dressed Miss Havisham (Martita Hunt) all combine to make Pip's existence full of doubt and fear.  There are only a few adults whom Pip trusts, one of whom is his decent and honorable brother-in-law Joe Gargery (Bernard Miles).As Pip matures,(now played by John Mills) he now realizes that his initial perception of the universe as intrinsically unstable was essentially a correct one. What he does learn, at great cost to his pride and self-respect, is that he can alter the equations of this universe slightly by a corresponding alteration in his perception of that universe.  By the novel's end, he can see more clearly the inner natures of those who most impacted on him. Joe Gargery he now can see as the good man he always was.  Magwitch is a man whom life pushed down the wrong path only to later relocate himself on the right one.  Estella has had time to mature even as he has.  Thus, the great expectations of the title is itself revealed as having undergone a metamorphosis.  Pip has learned a brutal lesson: the measurement of greatness is a function more of the heart than of the wallet.

Lean was also nominated for 9 other Oscars for writing and film editing as well as directing.  Two of those nominations came for this film in directing and writing, so my expectations for the director were ""great"".The Film itself was nominated for 5 Oscars itself, one of those for best picture, and it won 2 Oscars for cinematography and art direction.I've heard the film is considered one of the greatest of all Dickens films.  It is also on Roger Ebert's ""great movies"" series with outstanding company.  In his review he quotes the British critic Adrian Turner who has written books on both David Lean and the great director Billy Wilder and says how the atmosphere of the mansion in Great Expectations and its deranged occupant were inspiration for Wilder's classic Sunset Boulevard made four years later.  Turner also ""wonders if the early graveyard scene of Magwitch jumping at Pip from outside the screen didn't inspire countless imitations in horror films ever since.""  So my expectations of the film itself were ""great"".The story is simple enough a young boy named Pip lives with his mean sister and her caring husband Joe who is a Blacksmith.  One day Pip's presence is requested by a wealthy eccentric woman by the name of Miss. Havisham who wants him to visit and play, but for what reason.  Miss Havisham lives in an old wedding dress, her mansion is filled with cobwebs and she hasn't seen the light of day in many many years.  A young girl by the name of Estella who is very mean and nasty lives with Miss. Havisham, she is very insulting of Pip and doesn't want to play with him, yet Miss. Havisham tells her in her ear you can break his heart.  Six years go by and now Pip is 20, although the actor playing the grown up Pip John Mills was actually 38 at the time.  He is delivered a letter by a lawyer by the name of Mr. Jaggers (who also happens to be Miss. Havishams lawyer), played by  Francis L. Sullivan, who delivers a memorable performance and my personal favorite of the movie.  This letter informs Pip he has a benefactor and is to be taken raised as a gentleman.  The benefactor is to remain anonymous until they are ready to reveal themselves, although we and Pip have a good idea of who that is, or do we?  Pip moves in with a roomate by the name of Herbert Pocket played by Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars) and this is where the movie starts to reveal many of it's secrets.  Sounds like a great plot so again my expectations are high.In Roger Ebert's review he says ""One of the great things about Charles Dickens is the way his people colonize your memory. I wonder if there's any writer except Shakespeare who has created more characters whose names we remember, and whose types seem so true to human nature.""  This is very true, I read Great Expectations in school and I am now 29 and remembered some of the story but I still remembered the characters names of Pip, Miss Havisham and Estella.My expectations were great for this film as were Pip's in the film and both Pip and the film live up to and surpass there expectations.  This is a great story as far as film watching goes and is filled with all kinds of lessons on loyalty, true friendship, who we really are, revenge, how our choices effect our lives, that's just naming a few.This is a classic and when I give a star rating I am rating it against other classics.Highly recommend this to anyone, especially for children and families.Criterion Dvd Special Features:-Original Theatrical Trailer-Subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired.",5,My expectations were great. 4.5 Stars,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,3743,"['Considering', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'adaptation', 'directed/written', 'David', 'Lean', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'win', 'two', 'Oscars', 'later', 'forLawrence', 'Arabia', 'Superbit', 'Collection', 'andThe', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Lean', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', '9', 'other', 'Oscars', 'writing', 'film', 'editing', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'Two', 'nominations', 'came', 'film', 'directing', 'writing', 'expectations', 'director', 'were', 'great', '.The', 'Film', 'was', 'nominated', '5', 'Oscars', 'one', 'best', 'picture', 'won', '2', 'Oscars', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'film', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'Dickens', 'films', 'also', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'great', 'movies', 'series', 'outstanding', 'company', 'review', 'British', 'critic', 'Adrian', 'Turner', 'who', 'written', 'books', 'David', 'Lean', 'great', 'director', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'how', 'atmosphere', 'mansion', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'deranged', 'occupant', 'were', 'inspiration', 'Wilder', 'classic', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'made', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'Turner', 'also', 'wonders', 'early', 'graveyard', 'scene', 'Magwitch', 'jumping', 'Pip', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'countless', 'imitations', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'expectations', 'film', 'were', 'great', '.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Pip', 'mean', 'sister', 'caring', 'husband', 'Joe', 'who', 'Blacksmith', 'One', 'day', 'Pip', 'presence', 'requested', 'wealthy', 'eccentric', 'woman', 'name', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'who', 'visit', 'play', 'what', 'reason', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'old', 'wedding', 'dress', 'mansion', 'filled', 'cobwebs', ""n't"", 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'young', 'girl', 'name', 'Estella', 'who', 'very', 'mean', 'nasty', 'lives', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'very', 'insulting', 'Pip', ""n't"", 'want', 'play', 'yet', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'ear', 'can', 'break', 'heart', 'Six', 'years', 'go', 'now', 'Pip', '20', 'actor', 'playing', 'grown', 'up', 'Pip', 'John', 'Mills', 'was', 'actually', '38', 'time', 'delivered', 'letter', 'lawyer', 'name', 'Mr.', 'Jaggers', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Miss', 'Havishams', 'lawyer', 'played', 'Francis', 'L.', 'Sullivan', 'who', 'memorable', 'performance', 'personal', 'favorite', 'movie', 'letter', 'Pip', 'benefactor', 'be', 'taken', 'raised', 'gentleman', 'benefactor', 'remain', 'anonymous', 'are', 'ready', 'reveal', 'Pip', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'who', 'do', 'Pip', 'roomate', 'name', 'Herbert', 'Pocket', 'played', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Obi-Wan', 'Kenobi', 'Star', 'Wars', 'where', 'movie', 'reveal', 'many', 'secrets', 'great', 'plot', 'so', 'again', 'expectations', 'are', 'high.In', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'way', 'people', 'colonize', 'memory', 'wonder', 'writer', 'Shakespeare', 'who', 'created', 'more', 'characters', 'names', 'remember', 'types', 'seem', 'so', 'true', 'human', 'nature', 'very', 'true', 'read', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'school', 'am', 'now', '29', 'remembered', 'story', 'still', 'remembered', 'characters', 'names', 'Pip', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'Estella.My', 'expectations', 'were', 'great', 'film', 'were', 'Pip', 'film', 'Pip', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'surpass', 'expectations', 'great', 'story', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'watching', 'filled', 'kinds', 'lessons', 'loyalty', 'true', 'friendship', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'revenge', 'how', 'choices', 'effect', 'lives', 'just', 'naming', 'few.This', 'classic', 'when', 'give', 'star', 'rating', 'am', 'rating', 'other', 'classics.Highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'especially', 'children', 'families.Criterion', 'Dvd', 'Special', 'Features', '-Original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer-Subtitles', 'deaf', 'hearing', 'impaired']",Great Expectations VHS

Based on the Charles Dickens novel, John Mills stars as Pip, a young man who leaves the world of apprenticing a blacksmith to becoming a young gentleman of society. Mills is excellent, as is the whole cast, which also includes Alec Guinness and Valerie Hobson (and Jean Simmons as the love of Pip's childhood).Director David Lean, before he started doing epic dramas such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia and others, was a master at small personal dramas early in his career (In Which We Serve, Brief Encounter, Oliver Twist). The black and white photography is used splendidly here, with sets that often reflect so much bleakness that black and white is perfect for them. There is so much atmosphere in every detail in every shot.And it is all captured with incredible picture quality crispness on Blu-ray.

Here is a movie of such exquisite taste, such impeccable craftsmanship and so many beautifully rendered performances it is impossible not to be swept into this world of decaying grandeur. Lean, the architect of such larger-than-life movie excursions as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, delves deeply into Dickens' masterwork and comes up with one of the most poignant and visceral adaptations of the author's work. Bar none - the exemplar by which most any adaptation done since owes an immeasurable debt of gratitude.The disc has been remastered and restored and for the most part offers a faithful and fitting visual presentation.

241605,ACD6KAOJ9X973,6300988805,Orff,"[6, 6]","The world's first glimpse of director David Lean's epic vision is a landmark acheivement in the cinema. Never before had Dickens been  transferred to the screen with such cinematic skill, attention to detail,  and vivid style. Lean's unsurpassed cinematic eye, plus Guy Green's  Oscar-winning photography (a rare British win) transport the viewer  straight into Dickensian England. The eye is ravished throughout this  splendid production, (even if the creamy look isn't quite appropriate for  Dickens) but perhaps the opening scenes are the most breathtaking. From  Pip's visit to the church cemetery, with his sudden encountering of  Magwitch, to the escaped convict's capture, the medium of cinema has seldom  been exercised with such stunning brilliance. The superb yoking of image,  motion, and sound in these sequences create a tempo and atmosphere that  give this splendid production of the famous story tremendous appeal to any  and all.  The performances also create plenty of interest on their own;  character and very likeable; Finlay Currie (unknown now, but always  sensational) absolutely perfect as Magwitch; and Jean Simmons (the young  Estella) in an eye-catching turn, irresistably likeable in her snobbery.  in the screen-test stage; and Valerie Hobson (the mature Estella), who just  can't compete with Simmons. The music is only pleasant, but the art  direction (also an Oscar-winner) is a big plus. Last, but not least, the  scope, romantic heart, tight detail, and rich characterization of the book  is superbly conveyed in the film. Where the adaptation falls oh-so short is  the narrative, which, though most individual scenes are absolutely  marvellous, the sum of the parts slightly exceeds the whole; which is why,  though a great movie, doesn't quite match the hypnotic viewer interest, nor  the soaring inspiration of Lean's masterly follow-up &quot;Oliver  Twist&quot; (which surpasses this film in every aspect).

So is Miss Haversham's (Martita Hunt) fate. She has lost the love of her life and has remained locked up for years in a cobweb filled mansion complete with left over wedding cake.Together with her adopted daughter Estella (Jean Simmons (youth)/Valerie Hobson (adult)), she lives in a run down mansion, complete with overgrown vines.Pip (Anthony Wager (youth)/ John Mills (adult)) first meets Magwitch (Finlay Currie) in a graveyard and gives him assistance by giving him the tools to saw off his leg irons. Pip never imagines that in this one ""good deed"" he will in fact be rewarded with lifelong happiness.Pip is at first taunted by Estella and then later Miss Haversham tries to use Estella to ruin him and break his heart like the love of her life did to her so many years ago. She thinks of Estella and Pip as pawns in her cruel little game.If you think this story can be better told in color or in a newer version (1998), consider this. The very setting in which this story unfolds is perhaps best told within the shadowy essence of black-and-white cinematography.I first remember reading this story in a ""classic comic book"" as a child.

The Christmas dinner is great, with Uncle Pumblechook arriving with the announcement:&quot;I have brought you Mum, a bottle of port wine, and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry wine...&quot; To which Mrs. Gargery responds: &quot;Unc-le Pumb-le-chook, that IS kind!&quot; The theft of the savory pork pie is noticed at dinner, when, as Uncle Pumblechook intones: &quot;You could lay a piece of savory pork pie atop anything you care to mention and do no harm.&quot; (Fortunately for Pip, the soldiers arrive, searching for the escaped convict, Magwitch, and the ensuing excitement causes the pork pie to be forgotten...)Alas for Joe, Pip grows up to be, for a while, an insufferable snob, brought about by his mysterious good fortune, bestowed upon him by an anonymous benefactor. We are led to believe, as is Pip, that it is Miss Havisham (WONDERFULLY played by Martita Hunt-&quot;Do you know what I touch here? My heart...broken!&quot; in her vast room with the enormous dining table still laid out for the Wedding feast, with an ancient cake, dainties, and rats running over the whole)...He is engaged, as a boy, to be a companion to Miss Havisham, but her motivation is darker than he knows, as she has trained Estella, (Jean Simmons, very young and very exquisite) her ward, to wreak havoc on men's souls, and Pip is an easy victim, arrested by her beauty and aloofness...an unattainable dream. &quot;He calls the Knaves Jacks, this boy...&quot; in utter disdain, as she is contemptuous of everything about Pip. He meets Mr. Pocket in the garden of Satis House, Miss Havisham's forlorn estate, with the courtyard clock set permanently at 8:30, the time of her doomed wedding that wasn't to be... (Enough House, great title) The two have a half-hearted battle, with Pip bloodying the nose of the affable Mr. Pocket. They meet up again as young gentlemen, and share rooms together, Mr. Pocket now a very young, very eager Alec Guinness, in a great interpretation. He endeavors to teach Pip the finer side of social graces, beginning with his table manners, interrupting his own conversation to remonstrate with Pip to be more moderate in his eating and use of silverware...when Joe comes to visit, he disgraces himself with his clusmsiness, in Pip's censorious eyes, and loses control of his hat, in a way that would have been funny were it not so sad, under the circumstances. Joe realizes the change in Pip and how a chasm has opened up between their friendship and love for each other; it saddens him, but he is still kind, and hopeful as he departs, and tells Pip to think of him back in the forge, where he belongs, and then he &quot;won't judge him nearly so harshly.&quot;Pip learns much along his way, and meets great characters, including the Lawyer who handles his fortune while guarding the identity of his benefactor, and his assistant, who takes Pip to visit his home, (a wonderfully fanciful place, a little castle, with drawbridge and moat, far away from the outer world) with his elderly father whom he addresses as &quot;age-ed P.&quot;Pip's turmoil when he learns the identity of his benefactor, and Estella's origins, (far more humble than she knew herself) is riveting, as are all the characters and their inner workings, diplayed in true, inimitable Dickensian fashion. The ending is wholly unpredictable and is somewhat of a letdown; you want something different to tie things up after all the drama and anguish you are forced to witness...still, it is Dickens, and that is how he chose to end this story, one of his best, although I prefer, of all of them, David Copperfield.

Emphasizing the gothic fairy tale aspect without ignoring the social realism, the director builds one great sequence after another.  Every character is a masterpiece of invention.  Jean Simmons' Estella is perhaps the most astonishing of all: her cruelty is as surreal as someone in a film by Bunuel yet believable in this context.  Martita Hunt's Miss Havisham what will haunt you forever.  The actress' phrasing of simple lines: ""Love her....LOVVE her!"" encompasses all the twisted psychology in the world.  Alec Guiness's fop Pockett is delightful-- especially in his perfect mimicry of his earlier incarnation's boxing match.  Jaggers,  Wemmick, and Magwitch, too, are among the greatest characters ever to grace the movie screen.  No praise can be too great for John Mills' dignity and craft.  The sets, too, are astonishing in their balance of realism and fantasy.In short: a masterpiece.
