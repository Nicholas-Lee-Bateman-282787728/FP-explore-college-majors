1131915,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0011NVC8Y,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[6, 8]","(2.5) Few know the dysfunctional family like Noah Baumbach.  Just like `The Squid and the Whale' before it, `Margot at the Wedding' has at least one parent who is a writer and the head of a family constantly at odds with each other.Our titled heroine (Nicole Kidman) goes to her sister's wedding with her son, Claude (Zane Pais).  Sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is expecting, a fact she confides with Margot, but not with the husband-to-be.  A few times in the movie, they describe each other as best friends, yet when they return to each other, they quickly keep score of who hasn't spoken to whom and for how long.Once they meet at her seaside home, their conversations have a see-saw development, going from renewed affection to arguing and resentment.  Everything is close to coming to a boil.  Whenever they start to fight, they turn the conversation to something more pleasant, avoiding the seething unpleasantness that's just below the surface.As for the groom, Malcolm (Jack Black, in easily the best role I've seen him play to date), is a psychological disaster.  In an early scene, we find a testy man-child who loses his temper over poor play and quick losses in a double-team game of croquet.  Besides fluent cussing over the most mundane of circumstances, he expresses infantile needs and pet peeves in spurts and fits.  Often after an argument with Pauline, Malcolm blurts out, ""Let's..."" [well, do it, except in words I won't repeat.]And everyone has his or her own agenda in this movie.  Margot is a writer who hooks up with Dick, someone she has a writer's interview with and for whom she develops a crush. (And like in 'Junebug,' he's conveniently close to the family reunion.)  Ironically, her estranged husband, Jim (John Turturro) seems the most grounded of this sordid bunch.  He'd like to reconcile with her in Vermont and comes to Pauline's house to coax her back, but she is too infatuated with Dick and too wrapped up in herself to appreciate his thoughtful gift of warm slippers.  Meanwhile, Claude is sorting through his particularly difficult adolescence with his cousin, Ingrid, who share some of the most open discussions in the whole movie.The movie is episodic and has an emotional, forward moving story, but while the pace is admirable, the developments are on a turn organic and haphazard.  The Voglers, their neighbors across the fence, seem backward in a way that comes off crude to them, but the contrast is meant to illustrate two different kinds of crude.  (Their clashes are almost red-state, blue state in nature.)Which brings us to manners.  Malcolm is self-forgetful as we see him draw pornographic art while conversation ensues at the table.  (His rebuke brings about a rare moment when he truly can see his own failings.)  Margot takes Claude aside and brow beats him for not offering to help the hosts more often.  The boy's resentment pours through at those times when his proud mother is caught in an ignominious situation.  She has affection for him, but it seems based on her need for him, rather than a natural love.  For her part,  Margot is a serial breaker of promises.  Her blunt honesty is often uncalled for and goes beyond courage or charity.  Without divulging some of those secrets, she comes off as a bit of a snob.  (Anyone who chastises her hosts for not filling up the ice cube trays has her own work cut out for herself.)Yet, honesty does have a mixed effect in this cinematic offering.  Margot is right about Malcolm and a few other things I won't go into here, but the angst of alienation comes out on top, just like 'The Squid and the Whale,' which seems to me to be more of an magnum opus compared to this film.  However, I must admit that I enjoyed this movie somewhat, even if I objectively feel it is not quite good enough. And to their credit there are plenty of details and developments I've left out.  I'm on the fence on this one, folks.  How they get us absorbed in such obnoxious characters is quite a feat in itself, but the results are going to be an acquired taste.(The previews got me into this cinematic adventure.  They don't ruin the story either, but, after seeing the film, it surely doesn't give one a reason to see the rest.  There`s Malcolm throwing his croquet mallet in the water; Margot's up a tree; and Pauline follows Margot with those great lines, ""No, you haven't kept your mouth shut.  No, you haven't kept your MOUTH shut!""  How could you not want to see this movie?)(The music is distinctive here, too, but the opposite of 'The Squid and the Whale'.  In the former film, we heard the likes of avant-garde classics like Lou Reed's ""Street Hassle"" and Dean Wareham's version of Pink Floyd's ""Hey You"".  Here on 'Margot...' we are offered delightfully cheesy numbers, such as Steve Forbert's ""Romeo's Tune,"" Gilbert O' Sullivan's ""Clair,"" and parodies of pop music like Stephen Bishop's ""On and On"".  This aspect left me in stitches.)",3,"""Aw, Go Climb a Tree!""",1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,4939,"['2.5', 'Few', 'know', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'Just', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'Margot', 'Wedding', 'least', 'one', 'parent', 'who', 'writer', 'head', 'family', 'constantly', 'odds', 'other.Our', 'titled', 'heroine', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'sister', 'wedding', 'son', 'Claude', 'Zane', 'Pais', 'Sister', 'Pauline', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'expecting', 'fact', 'Margot', 'not', 'husband-to-be', 'few', 'times', 'movie', 'describe', 'other', 'best', 'friends', 'yet', 'when', 'return', 'other', 'quickly', 'keep', 'score', 'who', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'whom', 'how', 'long.Once', 'meet', 'seaside', 'home', 'conversations', 'have', 'see-saw', 'development', 'going', 'renewed', 'affection', 'arguing', 'resentment', 'Everything', 'close', 'coming', 'boil', 'Whenever', 'start', 'fight', 'turn', 'conversation', 'something', 'more', 'pleasant', 'avoiding', 'seething', 'unpleasantness', 'just', 'surface.As', 'groom', 'Malcolm', 'Jack', 'Black', 'easily', 'best', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'date', 'psychological', 'disaster', 'early', 'scene', 'find', 'testy', 'man-child', 'who', 'temper', 'poor', 'play', 'quick', 'losses', 'double-team', 'game', 'croquet', 'fluent', 'cussing', 'most', 'mundane', 'circumstances', 'infantile', 'needs', 'pet', 'peeves', 'spurts', 'fits', 'Often', 'argument', 'Pauline', 'Malcolm', 'out', 'Let', '[', 'well', 'do', 'words', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', ']', 'everyone', 'own', 'agenda', 'movie', 'Margot', 'writer', 'who', 'up', 'Dick', 'someone', 'writer', 'interview', 'whom', 'crush', ""'Junebug"", 'conveniently', 'close', 'family', 'reunion', 'Ironically', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Jim', 'John', 'Turturro', 'most', 'grounded', 'sordid', 'bunch', ""'d"", 'like', 'reconcile', 'Vermont', 'Pauline', 'house', 'coax', 'back', 'too', 'infatuated', 'Dick', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'appreciate', 'thoughtful', 'gift', 'warm', 'slippers', 'Meanwhile', 'Claude', 'sorting', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'adolescence', 'cousin', 'Ingrid', 'who', 'share', 'most', 'open', 'discussions', 'whole', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'episodic', 'emotional', 'forward', 'moving', 'story', 'pace', 'admirable', 'developments', 'are', 'turn', 'organic', 'haphazard', 'Voglers', 'neighbors', 'fence', 'seem', 'backward', 'way', 'off', 'crude', 'contrast', 'meant', 'illustrate', 'two', 'different', 'kinds', 'crude', 'clashes', 'are', 'almost', 'red-state', 'blue', 'state', 'nature', 'manners', 'Malcolm', 'self-forgetful', 'see', 'draw', 'pornographic', 'art', 'conversation', 'ensues', 'table', 'rebuke', 'rare', 'moment', 'when', 'truly', 'can', 'see', 'own', 'failings', 'Margot', 'Claude', 'aside', 'brow', 'beats', 'not', 'offering', 'help', 'hosts', 'more', 'often', 'boy', 'resentment', 'times', 'when', 'proud', 'mother', 'caught', 'ignominious', 'situation', 'affection', 'based', 'need', 'rather', 'natural', 'love', 'part', 'Margot', 'serial', 'breaker', 'promises', 'blunt', 'honesty', 'often', 'uncalled', 'courage', 'charity', 'divulging', 'secrets', 'off', 'bit', 'snob', 'Anyone', 'who', 'hosts', 'not', 'filling', 'up', 'ice', 'cube', 'own', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'Yet', 'honesty', 'have', 'mixed', 'effect', 'cinematic', 'offering', 'Margot', 'right', 'Malcolm', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'here', 'angst', 'alienation', 'out', 'top', 'just', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'be', 'more', 'magnum', 'opus', 'compared', 'film', 'However', 'must', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'even', 'objectively', 'feel', 'not', 'quite', 'good', 'enough', 'credit', 'are', 'plenty', 'details', 'developments', ""'ve"", 'left', 'out', ""'m"", 'fence', 'one', 'folks', 'How', 'get', 'absorbed', 'such', 'obnoxious', 'characters', 'quite', 'feat', 'results', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'acquired', 'taste', 'previews', 'got', 'cinematic', 'adventure', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'story', 'seeing', 'film', 'surely', ""n't"", 'give', 'one', 'reason', 'see', 'rest', 's', 'Malcolm', 'throwing', 'croquet', 'mallet', 'water', 'Margot', 'up', 'tree', 'Pauline', 'Margot', 'great', 'lines', 'No', 'have', ""n't"", 'kept', 'mouth', 'shut', 'No', 'have', ""n't"", 'kept', 'MOUTH', 'shut', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'music', 'distinctive', 'here', 'too', 'opposite', ""'The"", 'Squid', 'Whale', 'former', 'film', 'heard', 'likes', 'avant-garde', 'classics', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'Street', 'Hassle', 'Dean', 'Wareham', 'version', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Hey', 'Here', ""'Margot"", 'are', 'offered', 'delightfully', 'cheesy', 'numbers', 'such', 'Steve', 'Forbert', 'Romeo', 'Tune', 'Gilbert', 'O', 'Sullivan', 'Clair', 'parodies', 'pop', 'music', 'Stephen', 'Bishop', 'aspect', 'left', 'stitches']",N/A

""Margot at the Wedding"" continues in that same vein.The Amazon review says that ""the porcelain beauty of Nicole Kidman provides the perfect face for narcissism.""  Let me fix that for you:  ""You can't take your eyes off the massive expanse of Nicole Kidman's overly-Botoxed forehead.""  Especially when it's juxtaposed next to the lived-in beauty of Baumbach's real-life wife, Jenneifer Jason Leigh.Baumbach seems to have a special talent for coaxing tremendous performances out of child stars.

The storyline was decent enough to keep you interested, the characters were all in VERY fine form, and heck, even the presence of Jack Black couldn't ruin this one, haha (he played a crybaby that had emotional problems as his character, which was somewhat funny).The two female leading characters would constantly argue back and forth over whether the one woman should get married or not.I guess the focus of the storyline was how fairly normal people get ready for a marriage, and whether the marriage should actually take place or not.  I did think the story missed the boat a little bit in a few areas- I wanted to know more about the neighbors that were always angry and not friendly in any way, but they were hardly touched upon.The 11 year old boy that plays the son is another mystery to me- the relationship with him and his cousin actually came across like it was going to be more than just a friendship, but nothing really came from it (not that I was expecting two cousins to hit off a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, but the story appeared to be going in that direction and I wanted to see more).The parts where the one woman was stuck way up high in a tree so the fire company had to come out and take her down was good writing, and the ending was really good too because I didn't see it coming.  Not that it was a major plot twist or anything- it was just a nice way to wrap things up.I just don't see the hate for this movie.

Margot is one of the most mentally ill women ever to unravel her way to the big screen and Noah Baumbach's script elucidates the poisonous personality as well as any other I've witnessed. Allusion is made to her being afflicted by borderline personality disorder which she may well have given that she manages to make the people around her completely crazy. One cannot help but feel sad for the impact her dysfunctionality has upon her son Claude who is both devoted to her yet vaguely aware of her evil.I am reluctant to give this endeavor five stars, however. The fact is the movie fascinates in the manner of a textbook but the viewer's experience will not be pleasant. I've always respected Nicole Kidman yet am awed by her brilliance here. Her portrayal of Margot goes beyond inspired--indeed, she is stupendous. Illuminated clearly are the ways that people such as these consider the humans around them to be little more than props with which to manipulate and deconstruct. They yearn for the presence of fellow travelers on their journey to self-obliteration and ubiquitous misery. Overall, the acting is strong but Jack Black comes close to being over the top. He nearly makes a caricature out of his character. Overall, it's a thick, insightful montage of people that most of us have known in one setting or other but are fortunate enough not to deal with on a daily basis.

1131921,ACBFF25XJC2T7,B0011NVC8Y,Choice Critic,"[4, 7]","if you paid money for this movie.  The main ""dysfunction"" in this movie is the banal script and direction of Noah Baumbach.  Margot (Nicole Kidman) a writer from New York comes for her sister Pauline's (Jennifer Jason Leigh), wedding after a long period of alienation from the family. Pauline is getting married to Malcolm (Jack Black).You will find that you are laughing when you are supposed to cry and crying when you are supposed to laugh. That is especially true of Black's performance.  He was obviously attempting to stretch himself into drama. The only effect, though, is to stretch the viewer on the rack.His Malcolm is not a ""dysfunctional."" ""depressed"" or even ""disturbed"" character. He is a merely a fat, gross, undereducated slob who belongs in a soup kitchen.  Give Malcolm/Black a cellphone and he seems to start crying while babbling endlessly and frantically into the phone as though his phone card is running out of minutes.  He will cry, you will laugh.Nicole Kidman is a wonderful actress.  She has a history, though, of really picking clunkers to go with all the great movies she has made.  She really could use a better manager. Noah Baumbach should get partial credit for her sub par performance.  Her portrayal as the dominating, destructive older sister bears a greater likeness to the horror genre than the newly-minted ""dysfunctional"" drama of our time. If you ever want to see dysfunction and tragedy portrayed in a realistic manner, see ""Death of a Salesman"" with Lee J. Cobb.Also under the magic of Baumbach's direction, Jennifer Jason Leigh plays her role as the meek, dominated sister as though she was partially lobotomized right before the wedding. Passive? No, definitely gray matter missing.  She hobbles through each scene like a zombie. Come to think of it, if she were marrying the character portrayed by Malcolm/Black, that operation would provide a more credible storyline.The rest of the characters are ""throw-ins"".

1131922,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0011NVC8Y,Cubist,"[10, 12]","WithThe Squid and the Whale (Special Edition), filmmaker Noah Baumbach reinvented himself by finally discarding the comparisons to Woody Allen that followed his early films (Kicking & Screaming - Criterion Collection,Mr. Jealousy) and produced a more nuanced, mature film with acerbic wit. His follow-up, Margot at the Wedding, adheres to the same approach - chronicling the trials and tribulations of a deeply dysfunctional family.Nicole Kidman is one of those actors that is brilliant but needs to be challenged by a strong director with a specific vision and/or material that is challenging, like working with Stanley Kubrick onEyes Wide Shut (Unrated Two-Disc Special Edition)or Lars Von Trier onDogville. In the same year that she appeared in two high profile, expensive commercial flops (The Invasionand The Golden Compass), she made Margot at the Wedding, a much more interesting character piece. With Margot, she gets to create a wonderfully complex character that looks down on those around her because she feels that they are intellectually inferior to her.Jennifer Jason Leigh turns in another rock solid performance as a smart, free-spirited person trying to reconnect with her estranged sibling only to realize why they haven't spoken for years in the first place - Margot is mean-spirited. Jack Black is fascinatingly cast against type as a frustrated artist. He doesn't resort to his usual shtick, effortlessly mixing comedy and drama in a realistic way. It's great to see him build on the good work he did in Peter Jackson'sKing Kong - Extended Cut (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)andThe Holiday.Margot at the Wedding is the anti-feelgood film, populated with unlikable people who are cruel to each other as only family members can. There are many moments of humour, most of which appear in the first half of the film, but eventually the stretches of cruelty that the characters inflict on each other dominate and the film swerves into a bitter, misanthropic tailspin from which it never recovers. The problem with Margot at the Wedding is that the delicate balance he maintained in the first half is disrupted in such a way that any good will we had to any of these characters is long gone by the end credits.""A Conversation with Noah Baumbach and Jennifer Jason Leigh.""

1131928,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0011NVC8Y,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Writer-director Noah Baumbach's oeuvre seems to be persistently monitoring the untidiness of human foibles within a dysfunctional family and showing how decisions made by one character trigger unexpected and often unsavory actions from others. He focused on the repercussions of an ugly divorce in 2005'sThe Squid and the Whale, and in this off-kilter 2007 film, he captures the messiness generated by the discomfiting relationship between two nearly estranged sisters. What I like about both films is what I ironically don't like about them - the idiosyncratic, often redundant way that Baumbach makes his way through the narrative thread of a story. It feels a bit like a docu-dramedy but with obvious set-ups for the characters to reveal some flaw about themselves. Fortunately, he is quite good at this realistic level of observant detail in his direction and his screenplay; and his two leads, Nicole Kidman and Baumbach's wife Jennifer Jason Leigh, are quite adept as the sisters.Kidman plays the title role, a renowned, Manhattan-based short story writer who decides to take her pre-pubescent son Claude back to her family's beach house which her sister Pauline now owns. Pauline is getting hastily married to a garrulous, unemployed ""letter writer"" named Malcolm, a man Margot already detests before meeting him. It turns out that Margot is there not only for the wedding but to connect with her lover, also a successful writer, who lives nearby with his nubile daughter. More undisclosed facts come stumbling out from both sisters that quickly expose their relationship as a quagmire of latent resentments and petty jealousies. With her passive-aggressive narcissism, Margot initiates the lion's share of the manipulative tactics to validate her own worth. After several commercial debacles, the worst being theBewitchedupdate, it's good to see Kidman do such strong, subtle work here. Unafraid to show Margot's ugly machinations, Kidman still manages to show her character's vulnerability in unexpected ways.As perennially unhappy Pauline, Leigh has played variations on this role before, but she is expert at portraying such disheveled, approval-seeking personalities. Once again, Jack Black is in over his head as Malcolm, playing the comic elements on the surface and experiencing a personal catharsis that is laughable in a misguided way. Baumbach is especially good navigating child actors within an emotionally complex world, and wide-eyed Zane Pais (who looks like a member of the bubble-gum pop group Hanson) as Claude is no exception. In too-brief roles, John Turturro and Ciar&agrave;n Hands show up as Margot's patient husband and insensitive lover, respectively. Other than the original trailers and various previews, the 2008 DVD only has one extra, a brief interview between Baumbach and Leigh talking about the script and the production, especially working with Kidman and Black.",3,Strong Work from Kidman and Leigh Helps Complete the Spotty Character Arcs of Dysfunctional Sisters,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,2904,"['Writer-director', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'oeuvre', 'be', 'persistently', 'monitoring', 'untidiness', 'human', 'foibles', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'showing', 'how', 'decisions', 'made', 'one', 'character', 'trigger', 'unexpected', 'often', 'unsavory', 'actions', 'others', 'focused', 'repercussions', 'ugly', 'divorce', ""2005'sThe"", 'Squid', 'Whale', 'off-kilter', '2007', 'film', 'messiness', 'generated', 'discomfiting', 'relationship', 'two', 'nearly', 'estranged', 'sisters', 'What', 'like', 'films', 'what', 'ironically', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'idiosyncratic', 'often', 'redundant', 'way', 'Baumbach', 'way', 'narrative', 'thread', 'story', 'bit', 'docu-dramedy', 'obvious', 'set-ups', 'characters', 'reveal', 'flaw', 'Fortunately', 'quite', 'good', 'realistic', 'level', 'observant', 'detail', 'direction', 'screenplay', 'two', 'leads', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Baumbach', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'are', 'quite', 'adept', 'sisters.Kidman', 'title', 'role', 'renowned', 'Manhattan-based', 'short', 'story', 'writer', 'who', 'take', 'pre-pubescent', 'son', 'Claude', 'back', 'family', 'beach', 'house', 'sister', 'Pauline', 'now', 'Pauline', 'getting', 'hastily', 'married', 'garrulous', 'unemployed', 'letter', 'writer', 'named', 'Malcolm', 'man', 'Margot', 'already', 'meeting', 'out', 'Margot', 'there', 'not', 'only', 'wedding', 'connect', 'lover', 'also', 'successful', 'writer', 'who', 'nearby', 'nubile', 'daughter', 'More', 'undisclosed', 'facts', 'come', 'stumbling', 'out', 'sisters', 'quickly', 'expose', 'relationship', 'quagmire', 'latent', 'resentments', 'petty', 'jealousies', 'passive-aggressive', 'narcissism', 'Margot', 'lion', 'share', 'manipulative', 'tactics', 'validate', 'own', 'worth', 'several', 'commercial', 'debacles', 'worst', 'being', 'theBewitchedupdate', 'good', 'see', 'Kidman', 'do', 'such', 'strong', 'subtle', 'work', 'here', 'Unafraid', 'show', 'Margot', 'ugly', 'machinations', 'Kidman', 'still', 'show', 'character', 'vulnerability', 'unexpected', 'ways.As', 'perennially', 'unhappy', 'Pauline', 'Leigh', 'played', 'variations', 'role', 'expert', 'portraying', 'such', 'disheveled', 'approval-seeking', 'personalities', 'Once', 'again', 'Jack', 'Black', 'head', 'Malcolm', 'playing', 'comic', 'elements', 'surface', 'experiencing', 'personal', 'catharsis', 'laughable', 'misguided', 'way', 'Baumbach', 'especially', 'good', 'navigating', 'child', 'actors', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'world', 'wide-eyed', 'Zane', 'Pais', 'who', 'member', 'bubble-gum', 'pop', 'group', 'Hanson', 'Claude', 'exception', 'too-brief', 'roles', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Ciar', 'agrave', 'show', 'up', 'Margot', 'patient', 'husband', 'insensitive', 'lover', 'respectively', 'Other', 'original', 'trailers', 'various', 'previews', '2008', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'extra', 'brief', 'interview', 'Baumbach', 'Leigh', 'talking', 'script', 'production', 'especially', 'working', 'Kidman', 'Black']",N/A

His are message films and while they may not entertain the mass number of filmgoers, they are an important aspect of the new American cinema.Novelist Margot (Nicole Kidman) and her son Claude (Zane Pais, in an impressive film debut) are traveling to Margot's semi-estranged sister's wedding: hippie Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is marrying the bizarre artist wannabe Malcolm (Jack Black) in the backyard of the girl's old home somewhere in New England.  The sisters have a rocky relationship, strained by family secrets that include a distant mother and strange sister and a possibly pedophilia father, and strained by Margot's success as a writer (though she has failed in her marriage to the nebulous Jim - John Turturro - and is having an affair with another writer Dick - Ciar&aacute;n Hinds - whose Harvard daughter Maisy - Halley Feiffer - is an oversexed thorn in the family's eyes), and strained by Pauline's lack of direction away from her past as a 'woman of loose morals' to the discovery that she is pregnant by the loser Malcolm.  The entire story takes place on the weekend of Pauline's planned wedding and everything that could possibly go wrong does. Each of the sister's idiosyncrasies and maladjustments to life come into play and the only characters who seem to be able to make sense of any of the behavior abnormalities are the sisters' children - Claude and Pauline's daughter Ingrid (Flora Cross).  If there is a focal point that rises out of all this dysfunctional behavior it is the manner in which Margot and Claude are bonded as mother and son - not a perfect balance of roles but one of great tenderness and intention.Yes, there are some strangely comic aspects to this story, dark though they may be, but the overall impression is one of trying to understand why each of these strange characters has chosen their paths in life - and that opens the forum for viewer introspection and excellent post-viewing conversation.  Much of the success of this little film is due to the fine performances by Kidman, Leigh, Pais, Turturro, Hinds, and Black.

But while that movie found humor through a display of its character's blind spots, ""Margot"" only manages to achieve creepiness.Margot (Nicole Kidman) and her son Claude are on their way to Margot's sister's wedding. The sisters have been estranged, and it is presumably an act of peace for Marot to show up. Not long after their arrival however, the skein of sisterly reconciliation starts to come undone. Margot is the kind of noxious, toxic person who kills with kindness, saying and doing the most blunt and invasive things. She tells her fragile teen-aged son that a pair of sunglasses makes him look good, and later that make his face look wide. She spills secrets and breaks confidences. To the widest public possibleAnother movie treatment would have made this kind of character charming or quirky -- think Shirley MacLaine. But the idea here seems to be to portray the character without redeeming qualities. While this probably allows for a truer telling, it doesn't translate into a film that's enjoyable to watch. Margot is a study in narcissism, and the way it can destroy everything around it. Jennifer Jason Leigh is solid as Margot's sister Pauline. Jack Black actually turns in a decent performance as Malcolm, the out-of-work writer/artist that Pauline is about to marry. And Kidman does a terrific job portraying Margot, whose monstrosity is the accumulation of a thousands betrayals.The movie trailer portrayed ""Margot"" as a comedy. It is far from that, and the misdirection on the part of the studio is very much not appreciated. Though it is great work, this is a movie worth seeing only if you have a desperate need to dissect the kind of lacerating, self-involved person who sows pain wherever they step.",3,An unfunny thing happened on the way to the wedding,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,1858,"['Margot', 'Wedding', 'be', 'funny-serious', 'movie', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'vein', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'movie', 'found', 'humor', 'display', 'character', 'blind', 'spots', 'Margot', 'only', 'achieve', 'creepiness.Margot', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'son', 'Claude', 'are', 'way', 'Margot', 'sister', 'wedding', 'sisters', 'have', 'been', 'estranged', 'presumably', 'act', 'peace', 'Marot', 'show', 'up', 'Not', 'long', 'arrival', 'however', 'skein', 'sisterly', 'reconciliation', 'come', 'undone', 'Margot', 'kind', 'noxious', 'toxic', 'person', 'who', 'kindness', 'saying', 'doing', 'most', 'blunt', 'invasive', 'things', 'fragile', 'teen-aged', 'son', 'pair', 'sunglasses', 'look', 'good', 'later', 'make', 'face', 'look', 'wide', 'secrets', 'breaks', 'confidences', 'widest', 'public', 'possibleAnother', 'movie', 'treatment', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'kind', 'character', 'charming', 'quirky', 'think', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'idea', 'here', 'be', 'portray', 'character', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'probably', 'truer', 'telling', ""n't"", 'translate', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Margot', 'study', 'narcissism', 'way', 'can', 'destroy', 'everything', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'solid', 'Margot', 'sister', 'Pauline', 'Jack', 'Black', 'actually', 'decent', 'performance', 'Malcolm', 'out-of-work', 'writer/artist', 'Pauline', 'marry', 'Kidman', 'terrific', 'job', 'portraying', 'Margot', 'monstrosity', 'accumulation', 'thousands', 'betrayals.The', 'movie', 'trailer', 'portrayed', 'Margot', 'comedy', 'far', 'misdirection', 'part', 'studio', 'very', 'much', 'not', 'appreciated', 'great', 'work', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'have', 'desperate', 'need', 'dissect', 'kind', 'lacerating', 'self-involved', 'person', 'who', 'pain', 'step']",N/A

It's mode is realism, but there is a touch of melodrama along the way. Everything in even the most dramatic moments is tinged with humor, and it will test the acuteness of your own sense of humor. In all aspects this is sophisticated. This is not your Larry the Cable Guy brand of humor. It is strikingly politically incorrect, almost defiantly so. The humor is in the truth of the situations.In all aspects this is an honest portrait. Too honest for some viewers who prefer to keep their rosy-colored glasses on at all times. While one viewer will be spellbound by the intense portrayals, another viewer may be turned off by the unpleasantness. It is a matter of taste. Can you find humor in unpleasantness? Do you have the ability to laugh at things which are inherently sad but disturbingly funny? That is what this movie is about.The performances are all equally magnificent. This is an ensemble piece with its star role in the hands of the most gifted actress of our generation, Nicole Kidman. In every scene she brings the character to startling life. Even when you think you are going to drown in her misery and her unpleasantness towards others, she does something magical: evokes compassion and empathy. All of the characters here are imperfect, rude, brutally unkind, yet none of them are 'bad' people. They are simply human beings coping with life.I think the main theme of the movie is that we are ALL weird, cruel, and unpleasant, even though most of us try to gloss over that fact. We all lie and do things which hurt others, more or less. Those who deny it are hypocrites. To be human is to be imperfect.

1131940,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0011NVC8Y,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 8]","Noah Baumbach's discussion of this film was a bit painful to watch.  He talked in the DVD extras about how there were no establishing shots.  Scenes simply launched, creating the illusion that viewers are finding themselves in the middle of these characters' lives.  It would be fine if it actually worked.  Some of the film is shot in semi-darkness; so we detach visually from characters to whom we never attach.  None of the three main characters is likeable.  They all complain endlessly.  So it was a film for which it was hard to build much enthusiasm.What I did like very much in this film was the actual dialogue.  Noah Baumbach wrote the screenplay.  Each of the characters' speeches slingshots between wanting to get along with the others and their unrelenting criticism of them.  Within the same speech (and I don't have the script), you'll get lines that say ""I think of you as my best friend,"" soon followed by ""you disappointed me.""  The first scene with Margot and Pauline in the house has wonderfully crisp dialogue.  Baumbach achieves this total blending of opposite emotions throughout the screenplay.Nicole Kidman is one of my favorite actresses.  I rented this DVD because she was in it.  She hasn't done films quite this awful sinceDogvilleandBirth.  She is an excellent actress, but needs some assistance in picking her film roles.  Margot has some very deep emotional scars.  We don't really know what caused them.  However, she is literally unhappy with everyone in the film from her husband with whom she is breaking up to her sister to her sister's fiancee to her son.  The only person she is happy about is Dick played by Irish actor Ciaran Hinds, who perhaps is most cruel to her.Jennifer Jason Leigh has also had an interesting career.  I enjoyed her in ""Miami Blues"" from 1990 andThe Jacketfrom 2005.  Her lead in the filmMrs. Parker and the Vicious Circlewas one of my least favorites because of the dark subject matter.  She is a brainy actress.  As Pauline, she radiates sharp intellect with emotional instability.Jack Black plays the fiancee Malcolm.  Black is well loved as a comic actor and brings the few smiles out in this film.  His best lines are in the two trailers that are included on the DVD, particularly where he says he's punched lots of people.  ""Where are they?""  Pauline asks.  Well, they went away because I punched them.  He's really funny.  His bare bottom look in the mirror is a bit contrived.  He keeps his shorts up in the front where he's looking in the mirror, but lowers them over his backside where he's not looking.  I loved Black in the filmThe Holiday.  He's the most endearing part of this film.The children do good jobs.  Zane Pais in his first film that I could find does well as Margot's son Claude.  He's at an age where he needs a lot of support and finds himself trying to be empathic toward his fragile mother.  Flora Cross who was in ""Bee Season"" plays Pauline's daughter Ingrid.  She does well, but isn't overly memorable in this film's events.  Hallet Feiffer in her first film as Dick's daughter Maisy seems like walking trouble.Overall, the problem of the film is that it is not entertaining.  As a drama, it doesn't work very well since it seems that the characters do not significantly change.  The wedding doesn't even occur.  It is quite European in its viewpoint.  Perhaps it will be a hit there.

1131941,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0011NVC8Y,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[0, 0]","I almost gave this five stars but the film's overwhelming negativity and dour nature prevented that. I can understand that writer director Noah Baumbach did not want to make a Hollywood movie--in fact, in this film, he essentially bends over backwards to make an ANTI-Hollywood movie--but surely there might be some shred of hope or positivity to identify with. But that's not the case here.Instead we have a film of tremendous intelligence in that it does a masterful job at portraying the neurotic complexity of a number of characters--primarily Margot, her sister Pauline, and Pauline's fiance Malcolm--played respectively by Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Jack Black. Black is so totally different in this film from anywhere else he's shown up that for my money, he's a real standout. He plays a woefully immature unemployed artist--very smart, but very lacking in emotional depth--who's engaged to Jennifer Jason Leigh's Pauline.There's an interesting parallel structure here as well. Margot has a son Claude; Pauline has a daughter Ingrid; both are about the same age (roughly 11 or 12). Margot's lover Dick has a somewhat older daughter Maisie. Margot's estranged husband Jack has a somewhat similar relationship to her that Malcolm has to Pauline; both men are in some way distanced from their mates. In this film, no single character appears to have qualities that endear the viewer to him or her; Baumbach, it seems, wanted to insure that everyone here is perceived as neurotic enough to warrant some degree of distance from overt identification.Thus what we really have here is not so much a linear film at all as a complex multi-character portrait in which the characters are revealed through different incidents and exchanges of conversation, all of which, as mentioned previously, are done with very high intelligence indeed. You can't help but admire this braininess, even as you cringe at the lack of heart that blasts through the film in one scene after another.It could very well be this lack of heart that has given this a three-star average rating here. At least in Baumbach's last film, The Squid and the Whale, there was some evidence of warmth. Here there is bascially none.At the very end, when Margot finally does catch the bus, you realize it's not because she wants to be with her son as much as it is not wanting to be with her sister, the option she would have if she stayed where she was. (I'm not giving anything away here because in essence, there's really nothing to give away).Claude has problems, not only with his mother but also in how he relates to the world. When a neighborhood kid does something nasty to him, he runs to his mother.

1131945,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0011NVC8Y,mirasreviews,"[3, 5]","""Margot at the Wedding"" was written and directed by Noah Baumbach as a family drama, though it is more successful as a character study. Margot (Nicole Kidman) is a New York writer who travels with her pubescent son Claude (Zane Pais) to attend the wedding of her estranged sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) at their childhood home. Pauline is engaged to an unemployed, affable artist/musician named Malcolm (Jack Black), whom Margot feels is not good enough. Margot's judgmental, meddling ways threaten not only her relationships, but this time also her sister's wedding plans.I have the impression that ""Margot at the Wedding"" is supposed to be about the resilience of strained family relationships, sometimes overwrought, sometimes darkly comic. But everything that's interesting revolves around Margot, a distasteful, manipulative, but undeniably strong personality who wreaks havoc with other people's lives and emotions doing what she imagines is best for them. This is a memorable performance from Nicole Kidman, even if the rest of the film isn't. Young Zane Pais hits the right notes in illustrating Margot's bizarre relationship with her child. Claude still craves closeness with his mother but is old enough now to notice her behavior.Beyond Margot, the script is a patchwork of unconvincing contrivances. The bizarre neighbors serve no purpose. Why would someone walk a dog, off leash, along a one-lane road in the middle of the woods after dark? The only reason I can think of is so it can be hit by a car. The introduction of Margot's husband Jim is unwise, since the long-married pair don't appear compatible. Do siblings really torment each other, scream accusations, and act the next day as if nothing happened? As unpleasant as Margot is, Nicole Kidman is electric -quite a feat since she can't manage a facial expression with all that Botox.The DVD (Paramount 2008): Bonus features are 2 theatrical trailers and ""A Conversation with Noah Baumbach and Jennifer Jason Leigh"" (13 min), in which Leigh and Baumbach discuss Kidman's, Pais', and Leigh's performances, casting Jack Black, the relationships between the characters, and the decision not to use a score.

His response is to take off his sweater and put it over her shoulders -- and then she breaks down and weeps and holds him.  She hadn't known that she was so cold.This delicate and dark comedy is a nuanced study of the bonds that tie us to our most significant others.  We see ourselves mirrored in the others who are central to our lives -- and yet deny that this mirroring takes place, and blame the others for the ways in which they show up our own shortcomings.  The characters are extremely self-aware and at the same time utterly blind to their own complicity in the weaknesses they see in each other.  Margot is coming home with her son to her sister Pauline's wedding to a depressed and out of work artist/musician.  While obviously unhappy and unfaithful in her own marriage and unable to see beyond her own unhappiness, she can't help but make clear her disapproval of Pauline's partner.  The film's heart is her son Claude, whose confusion about himself mingles with a sharp clarity regarding the psychological complexities of adults, who clings to his mother even as she alternates with him between allowing him the intimacy of her own judgments about everyone else and passing cold and clinical judgments upon him.Noah Baumbach has achieved in this film what Woody Allen aimed for in some of his darker films: to update the insight into the strange collusion that happens between lovers and close others that is evident in the works of the late Swedish film master Ingmar Bergman.  Even the lighting and the setting remind of Bergman -- the brilliant cinematography by Henry Savides with muted but still vibrant colors against a whited sky captures something of the vitality of Sven Nykvist's black and white; and the setting recalls Bergman's Faro Island.  And like most of Bergman's films, the bleakness is not all: there are moments of tenderness in which honest self-revelation is met by compassionate understanding.  I think that is the point: the very neediness that makes us vulnerable, that allows us to be shattered by the words of another, is also what opens us up to intimacy and to the possibility in communion with others of breaking free from our shallow self-understandings.",4,"Bonds of anguish, bonds of love -- a dark comedy of human errors",1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,2533,"['Margot', 'played', 'vibrant', 'unstable', 'combination', 'self-possession', 'fragility', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'husband', 'insisting', 'not', 'pretend', 'be', 'understanding', 'effort', 'prove', 'independence', 'also', 'clearly', 'damage', 'one', 'who', 'kindness', 'can', 'not', 'deserve', 'response', 'take', 'off', 'sweater', 'put', 'over', 'shoulders', 'then', 'down', 'weeps', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'was', 'so', 'cold.This', 'delicate', 'dark', 'comedy', 'nuanced', 'study', 'bonds', 'tie', 'most', 'significant', 'others', 'see', 'mirrored', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'central', 'lives', 'yet', 'deny', 'mirroring', 'place', 'blame', 'others', 'ways', 'show', 'up', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'self-aware', 'same', 'time', 'utterly', 'blind', 'own', 'complicity', 'weaknesses', 'see', 'other', 'Margot', 'coming', 'home', 'son', 'sister', 'Pauline', 'wedding', 'depressed', 'work', 'artist/musician', 'obviously', 'unhappy', 'unfaithful', 'own', 'marriage', 'unable', 'see', 'own', 'unhappiness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'clear', 'disapproval', 'Pauline', 'partner', 'film', 'heart', 'son', 'Claude', 'confusion', 'mingles', 'sharp', 'clarity', 'regarding', 'psychological', 'complexities', 'adults', 'who', 'mother', 'even', 'allowing', 'intimacy', 'own', 'judgments', 'everyone', 'else', 'passing', 'cold', 'clinical', 'judgments', 'him.Noah', 'Baumbach', 'achieved', 'film', 'what', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'aimed', 'darker', 'films', 'update', 'insight', 'strange', 'collusion', 'lovers', 'close', 'others', 'evident', 'works', 'late', 'Swedish', 'film', 'master', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Even', 'lighting', 'setting', 'remind', 'Bergman', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'Henry', 'Savides', 'muted', 'still', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'whited', 'sky', 'captures', 'something', 'vitality', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'black', 'white', 'setting', 'Bergman', 'Faro', 'Island', 'most', 'Bergman', 'films', 'bleakness', 'not', 'are', 'moments', 'tenderness', 'honest', 'self-revelation', 'met', 'compassionate', 'understanding', 'think', 'point', 'very', 'neediness', 'vulnerable', 'be', 'shattered', 'words', 'also', 'what', 'up', 'intimacy', 'possibility', 'communion', 'others', 'breaking', 'free', 'shallow', 'self-understandings']",N/A

""Such is life"", Baumbach seems to be saying, ""..only a muddle of wounded egos thrashing about.""The patchiness extends from the cinematography (gorgeous and crisp outdoors, but muddy and weak-colored in interior scenes) to the performances.  Nicole Kidman never really convinces as the Manhattanite writer, Margot...possibly because no scene in the movie establishes the character's competence at her profession.  Jack Black, as the pathetic boy/man Malcolm, hams it up as he saws away at his own masculinity.The best, and possibly the only redeeming performance in the film, comes from Zane Pais as the adolescent boy Claude, the sweet-faced spawn of Kidman, a role that nearly seems ""imported"" from a foreign film.  Yes, Baumbach has seen Eric Roehmer's movies...but does he emulate them, or does he just want to seem ""chic""?There's a good story in this tragic-comic farce, but Baumbach isn't interested in telling it.

Margot, the older sister, writer who has marital difficulties and is too emotionally attached to her son is causing all sorts of tensions within the family.  She is just too self indulgent and self-absorbed to truly care about anyone.  She is self righteous to the point where she alienates everyone around her, even her lover.  Her relationship with her son is not the mother-son relationship.  It is almost as if Margot is trying to be his friend instead of his mother.  We do not know why Margot and her sister are such damaged goods and the film does not touch up on that.  But Margot is self medicating and we know her wounds are deep.  She cannot imagine any more and the source of her ""fiction"" writing is her sole experience with her family that she shares with her audience.  Film has many funny moments and we are constantly in awe on how people educated and seemingly well off can be so mean and hurtful to each other.

Zwick,"[3, 3]","**1/2The recriminations fly fast and furious in ""Margot at the Wedding,"" Noah Baumbach's follow-up to his vastly superior family drama, ""The Squid and the Whale,"" from 2005.  This is one of those movies in which a group of fashionably neurotic individuals gather together at a seaside country estate to pick at festering wounds and spill their guts to anyone who'll listen.The soul-baring folk include Margot, a troubled novelist; Claude, her troubled teenaged son; Pauline, her troubled younger sister; and Malcolm, Pauline`s troubled, ne`er-do-well fiance.  Carrying more psychological baggage with them than actual luggage, Margot and Claude travel from New York City to the girls' childhood home on Long Island, ostensibly to attend Pauline and Malcolm's wedding but actually to engage in a psychoanalytic free-for-all that would have Sigmund Freud himself scratching his head in befuddlement.Even fine performances from the likes of Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Jack Black, Zane Pais, John Turturro and Seth Barrish can't keep these characters from devolving into a bunch of whining, self-pitying bores.  The tone of the film careens wildly from the pseudo-profound to the self-consciously whimsical - and just about every point in between.  And as if all this weren't enough, the script throws in some eccentric, borderline-psychotic neighbors who tote axes over their shoulders, throw animal body parts onto Pauline's property, and try to bite the ears off people they don't like.  (And we won't even go into the symbol-laden tree that stands meaningfully on the premises, just waiting for the proper moment to deliver its message).""The Squid and the Whale"" was not a perfect film, but at least its domestic drama seemed rooted in the real world and the script offered a number of astute insights into family dynamics.  ""Margot at the Wedding,"" on the other hand, feels too much like a movie and its characters too much like the product of a scriptwriter's invention to make us believe in or care about what is happening on screen.

1131957,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B0011NVC8Y,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[2, 4]","A devilish, troubling comedic drama dripping with intrigue and impeccable characterization, writer/director Noah Baumbach's ""Margot at the Wedding,"" new to DVD, is an eccentric flick that briefly hit the arthouse circuit late last year. With a stellar group of actors to bring his story to life, Baumbach delivers engaging cinema from the first frame to the last.Margot and her 11-year-old son Claude, played by the inimitable Nicole Kidman and newcomer Zane Pais, pay her sister Pauline a visit when she announces her engagement to self-loathing slacker Malcolm (""I hate that question `what do you do?'""). However, the new fiances, portrayed respectively by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jack Black, seem strangely drawn apart. Could it be that they are marrying out of convenience, afraid no one else will give them a second glance, or is Margot's irrepressibly downcast personality casting an unwanted spell?Claude's relationship with his mother faces strange adversity during the visit. Consistently nitpicking, Margot never fails to bring their relationship to the darkest depths as though helpless to silence her inner demons. The same goes for Pauline, whom she pushes away with her unflinching criticism of Malcolm, who is well aware of her disdain for him. Not motivated by malice but clear insecurity, she brings out the worst in everyone present, opening old wounds and inspiring similar pain in those around her.Kidman and Leigh make an understatedly magnificent pair of dysfunctional sisters ever at odds, trading subtle jabs at each other perhaps unwittingly. Making a marked effort to convince Margot she has at last found an anchor in her troubled life, Pauline beats herself at her own game, maintaining her own doubt. Margot meanwhile is not convinced, likely because she wills it so. She may love her sister, but she is unable to relinquish control and embrace the notion that Pauline may now be successful in finding a true, lasting love - something she has bitterly been deprived of and must now face head on whether or not she cares to. Kidman is dazzling, letting the audience empathize with her complex, polarizing protagonist.Black is also in top form, giving rich, human depth to a character that would have suffered from one-dimensionalization in less attentive hands, and the young Pais is wonderful in his film debut, providing an ideal foil for Margot and reminding the audience of her ultimate benevolence.Baumbach's story is a brooding one, but ""Margot at the Wedding"" is a stone winner, a rare film that continues to reveal its treasures long after initial viewing.",4,Do Crash This 'Wedding',1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2593,"['devilish', 'troubling', 'comedic', 'drama', 'dripping', 'intrigue', 'impeccable', 'characterization', 'writer/director', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'Margot', 'Wedding', 'new', 'DVD', 'eccentric', 'flick', 'briefly', 'hit', 'arthouse', 'circuit', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'stellar', 'group', 'actors', 'bring', 'story', 'life', 'Baumbach', 'engaging', 'cinema', 'first', 'frame', 'last.Margot', '11-year-old', 'son', 'Claude', 'played', 'inimitable', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'newcomer', 'Zane', 'Pais', 'pay', 'sister', 'Pauline', 'visit', 'when', 'engagement', 'self-loathing', 'slacker', 'Malcolm', 'hate', 'question', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'However', 'new', 'fiances', 'portrayed', 'respectively', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Jack', 'Black', 'seem', 'strangely', 'drawn', 'apart', 'Could', 'be', 'are', 'marrying', 'convenience', 'afraid', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'give', 'second', 'glance', 'Margot', 'irrepressibly', 'downcast', 'personality', 'casting', 'unwanted', 'spell', 'Claude', 'relationship', 'mother', 'strange', 'adversity', 'visit', 'Consistently', 'nitpicking', 'Margot', 'never', 'bring', 'relationship', 'darkest', 'depths', 'helpless', 'silence', 'inner', 'demons', 'same', 'Pauline', 'whom', 'away', 'unflinching', 'criticism', 'Malcolm', 'who', 'well', 'aware', 'disdain', 'Not', 'motivated', 'malice', 'clear', 'insecurity', 'out', 'worst', 'everyone', 'present', 'opening', 'old', 'wounds', 'inspiring', 'similar', 'pain', 'her.Kidman', 'Leigh', 'make', 'understatedly', 'magnificent', 'pair', 'dysfunctional', 'sisters', 'ever', 'odds', 'trading', 'subtle', 'jabs', 'other', 'perhaps', 'unwittingly', 'Making', 'marked', 'effort', 'convince', 'Margot', 'last', 'found', 'anchor', 'troubled', 'life', 'Pauline', 'own', 'game', 'maintaining', 'own', 'doubt', 'Margot', 'meanwhile', 'not', 'convinced', 'likely', 'so', 'may', 'love', 'sister', 'unable', 'relinquish', 'control', 'embrace', 'notion', 'Pauline', 'may', 'now', 'be', 'successful', 'finding', 'true', 'lasting', 'love', 'something', 'bitterly', 'been', 'deprived', 'must', 'now', 'face', 'head', 'not', 'Kidman', 'dazzling', 'letting', 'audience', 'empathize', 'complex', 'polarizing', 'protagonist.Black', 'also', 'top', 'form', 'giving', 'rich', 'human', 'depth', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'suffered', 'one-dimensionalization', 'less', 'attentive', 'hands', 'young', 'Pais', 'wonderful', 'film', 'debut', 'providing', 'ideal', 'foil', 'Margot', 'reminding', 'audience', 'ultimate', 'benevolence.Baumbach', 'story', 'brooding', 'one', 'Margot', 'Wedding', 'stone', 'winner', 'rare', 'film', 'reveal', 'treasures', 'long', 'initial', 'viewing']",N/A
1131958,AGSWTH7SP2256,B0011NVC8Y,R. W. Rasband,"[24, 24]","There's probably not been so dark a movie comedy as ""Margot At The Wedding"" in a long, long time, and this could be why it flopped at the box office.  It appears to be asking a lot to expect an audience to show up for a film with a lead character this narcissistic and destructive (and played by a star as big as Nicole Kidman, no less.)  But you need to go into this with the proper expectations.  No one is going to change or grow, at least during the running time of the movie.  Remember the oldSeinfeld - The Complete Seriesrule; no hugging, and no learning anything?  Ditto in spades for ""Margot.""  Indeed, this movie is a lot like a 90 minute episode ofCurb Your Enthusiasm - The Complete Sixth Seasonwith all visible remaining sentiment altogether drained.  I loved it, butDr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Two-Disc Special Edition)is my idea of a classic comedy.  I think there are powerful emotions of love at work in ""Margot"" but they jostle for position with selfishness, envy, and hostility.  Kind of like a real family.This movie also wears its influences on its sleeve.  Margot is supposed to be an acclaimed fiction writer of theThe New Yorker [1-year subscription]-magazine variety, and you need to approach this movie as a literary artifact.  If you hated reading and explicating short stories in school, you probably won't like this movie.  But if you get a thrill from figuring out complicated characters; or connecting the dots between subtle plot twists and developments, then this is the movie for you.  Notice the opening and closing scenes of the movie, and what Margot says about her son's sunglasses.  If you like to notice details like these and pick up on a film maker's hints, you will have a good time here.  I have never been that big a fan of Kidman, (except to marvel at her beauty)  but she is really, really good as the awful Margot.  As somebody else wrote about her character, Margot is like an emotional terrorist who tosses bombs at any available target.  But you get some hints about why she is like she is from the contradictory things she says about her dead father.  (Notice how she and Jennifer Jason Leigh talk about him between themselves, and what she says about him in public at a book reading.)  And she is a tortured soul, as you can see from her relationship with her kindly husband (John Turturro, in what amounts to a cameo.)  She may be the smartest person in the room, but she is also the unhappiest.  It's nice to see Jennifer Jason Leigh again as the (relatively) sane sister.  Jack Black as Malcolm does a more subdued variation of his usual character.  At first you think this goofy failed musician is going to be the beacon of normality for us through these hilariously wounded people.  But, without giving too much away, Malcolm has his own issues and it's interesting how Black blends his own patented zaniness with the demands of this plot (particularly in his last scene.)I think that a lot of the people who likedThe Squid and the Whale (Special Edition)(Baumbach highly-praised previous movie) were disappointed by ""Margot"" because it lacked the nostalgia and coming-of-age elements that were kind of like the sugar coating over the bitter taste of the earlier film.  I suppose an angry, successful, gorgeous Nicole Kidman is harder to take than the defeated, schlumpy (but just as angry) Jeff Daniels in ""Squid""  (even though they are playing very similar characters.)  I think this is one of those movies that gets overlooked when first released but will grow in reputation as time passes.  It's just really, really funny and truthful in ways we don't like to think about.

1131960,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B0011NVC8Y,Scrimshaw,"[0, 0]","Margot at the Wedding is a 2007 tragicomedy written and directed by Noah Baumbach. It follows a neurotic writer named Margot (Nicole Kidman) and her son Claude (Zane Pais), who travel to visit Margot's sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) on the eve of her wedding to Malcolm (Jack Black). During the course of the visit it becomes clear that Margot does not approve of Malcolm, who is depicted as an annoying fat loser who is unhappy with Pauline. Noah Baumbach has proven once more that he simply cannot direct a good film. Almost all of the characters are annoying, vulgar, and unlikable, so you could really care less about what happens to them and the film seemed rather pointless, it's almost as if Noah Baumbach traveled to the home of one of his friends the weekend before a wedding and filmed what went on there. There is never any wedding, by the way, so I have no idea why this film was titled Margot at the Wedding. It should have stuck with Nicole at the Beach, which is what is was going to be called, apparently, before Nicole Kidman signed on. The film itself is a dark dramatic film with some funny scenes thrown in to lighten the overall mood. And the ending isn't happy either. Jack Black, primarily a comedic actor, attempts to stretch himself into dramatic territory here but fails miserably, if he knows what's good for him, he should stick to comedic films like School of Rock and Tropic Thunder. The only thing that kept this film from a one star rating was the setting, scenery, and cinematography. The film takes place in a pleasant looking house by the sea and there are beautiful shots of the bay or harbor as well as some woods where Margot and Pauline take a walk in in one scene.

1131961,AE9JH12P0CETA,B0011NVC8Y,S.G.R. Black,"[0, 0]","I can't even explain how hesitant I was to watch 'Margot at the Wedding'. After reading countless reviews of how terrible it was, I stayed away from it for as long as I could, but I thought to myself: Could it really be that bad? After all, Noah Baumbach did write and direct the wonderful 'The Squid and the Whale' (one of my favorite films). I thought I owed it to myself to at least give it shot.'Margot at the Wedding' is the story of Margot played well by Nicole Kidman, who travels with her son to her childhood home by the shore to attend her sister's wedding, played equally well by Jennifer Jason Leigh. You know from the begining that Margot is not too keen on Pauline's husband to be, played just OK by Jack Black. You also know that there's this sort of unpoken resentment towards her as well. When the two sisters are reuninted, a kind of battle emerges. They don't physically fight. However, they do use their words to cut at each other to their satisfaction. They even go as far as to use their own children to get back at the other. Still, the two sisters proudly tell everyone around them that there's great love between them, but once they're together, though, they somehow feel the need to draw blood.It's an interesting film to say the least. It's very acute in its observations of Margot and Pauline. Though it's not nearly as good as 'The Squid and the Whale', I did find many similarites. One being the way parents talk to their children. Instead of speaking to them like thier own children, they speak to them like they're adults, which is not such a great idea because many times children simply just don't need to know certain things. Margot is the worst. She tells her son the most awful and uncomfortable things, deep and personal things about herself and her sister. In one scene, I particularly loved, Margot's son easily tells her that he had masterbated in the morning. She relplies by telling him, ""That's something I don't need to know."" It's a great line considering that she's not even aware that she too does the same thing.As far as preformances go, the film is watchable. Kidman and Leigh are very believable as sisters. The dialogue is honest and razor sharp even if some people think that nobody talks like that. Remember, these two characters are pretty smart. So who's to say that they really don't talk like that? Evern when they do, it never feels phoney or unrealistic. It's a good movie. It may not ""wow!"" you necessarily or even speak to you, but it is a good movie, simply put.However, the film can be unpleasant to some; OK, to many. It's not at all a happy comedy. In fact, it hardly even qualifies as a comedy. If you can manage to find a spot of humor in it then good for you. I found some. It is though a specifically focused film that, in the end, gets the job done. Even though these two characters have their differences and who are, in fact, so very differecnt from each other, no matter how much they think the other doesn't know them at all, they do. Margot's decision in the last scene is proof of that.",3,Margot VS Pauline,1205884800,"03 19, 2008",2008,3064,"['ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'explain', 'how', 'hesitant', 'was', 'watch', ""'Margot"", 'Wedding', 'reading', 'countless', 'reviews', 'how', 'terrible', 'was', 'stayed', 'away', 'as', 'long', 'could', 'thought', 'myself', 'Could', 'really', 'be', 'bad', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'did', 'write', 'direct', 'wonderful', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'thought', 'owed', 'myself', 'least', 'give', 'shot', 'Wedding', 'story', 'Margot', 'played', 'well', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'son', 'childhood', 'home', 'shore', 'attend', 'sister', 'wedding', 'played', 'equally', 'well', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'know', 'begining', 'Margot', 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'Pauline', 'husband', 'be', 'played', 'just', 'OK', 'Jack', 'Black', 'also', 'know', 'sort', 'unpoken', 'resentment', 'towards', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'two', 'sisters', 'are', 'reuninted', 'kind', 'battle', 'emerges', 'do', ""n't"", 'physically', 'fight', 'However', 'do', 'use', 'words', 'cut', 'other', 'satisfaction', 'even', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'use', 'own', 'children', 'get', 'back', 'other', 'Still', 'two', 'sisters', 'proudly', 'tell', 'everyone', 'great', 'love', 'once', ""'re"", 'together', 'though', 'somehow', 'feel', 'need', 'draw', 'blood.It', 'interesting', 'film', 'say', 'least', 'very', 'acute', 'observations', 'Margot', 'Pauline', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', ""'The"", 'Squid', 'Whale', 'did', 'find', 'many', 'similarites', 'One', 'being', 'way', 'parents', 'talk', 'children', 'Instead', 'speaking', 'thier', 'own', 'children', 'speak', ""'re"", 'adults', 'not', 'such', 'great', 'idea', 'many', 'times', 'children', 'simply', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'certain', 'things', 'Margot', 'worst', 'son', 'most', 'awful', 'uncomfortable', 'things', 'deep', 'personal', 'things', 'herself', 'sister', 'one', 'scene', 'particularly', 'loved', 'Margot', 'son', 'easily', 'had', 'masterbated', 'morning', 'telling', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'great', 'line', 'considering', 'not', 'even', 'aware', 'too', 'same', 'thing.As', 'far', 'preformances', 'go', 'film', 'watchable', 'Kidman', 'Leigh', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'sisters', 'dialogue', 'honest', 'razor', 'sharp', 'even', 'people', 'think', 'nobody', 'talks', 'Remember', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'smart', 'So', 'who', 'say', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'Evern', 'when', 'do', 'never', 'phoney', 'unrealistic', 'good', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'wow', 'necessarily', 'even', 'speak', 'good', 'movie', 'simply', 'put.However', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'unpleasant', 'OK', 'many', 'not', 'happy', 'comedy', 'fact', 'hardly', 'even', 'comedy', 'can', 'manage', 'find', 'spot', 'humor', 'then', 'good', 'found', 'specifically', 'focused', 'film', 'end', 'job', 'done', 'Even', 'two', 'characters', 'have', 'differences', 'who', 'are', 'fact', 'so', 'very', 'differecnt', 'other', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'think', 'other', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'Margot', 'decision', 'last', 'scene', 'proof']",N/A

She was extremely insecure andunraveled by the end of that marriage, until she met Malcolm, who is a somewhat crass out of work musician, who makes her laugh and gives her confidence.They can't wait to get married .Normal enough right? Should be a nice family gathering with lots of good memories and smiles. Oh no. Not with Margot involved it's not. Nothing is ever simple with Margot.She is the kind of person who people run to the other side of the street when they see her coming.She also loves to spread rumors about people and doesn't know how to relax and enjoy herself at all.To top it all of,she criticizes everything everyone else does in the most razor sharp way ,imaginable. She feels that her success entitles her to attack people like this. Even complete strangers,and esp. her family.Margot also, is unhappy her sister is marrying Malcolm,(played by Jack Black)who she finds common and is also jealous of her sister's happiness(Margot's own marriage is rocky# and tries to ruin her wedding by causing drama and almost succeeds.What You might not likeThis movie - can get extremely uncomfortable - but if you have difficult relatives that makes your holidays hellish.

Nicole plays Margot in layers. What I mean by that ,is Margot is just not this terrible person , she has a lot of layers to her and Kidman explores those layers with her superb acting skills.It makes you hope that Margot realizes how ugly she is to people and make it right with the ones who count.But I doubt she ever will.I don't recomend this to everyone ,but if you have a mother-in-law or aunt like this, you will probably get this movie and maybe get the courage to tell them to stop causing so much unneeded carnage.",3,thank you for NOT helping!,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,2593,"['story', 'Margot', 'famous', 'writer', 'Manhattan', '11', 'yrs', 'old', 'son', 'Claude', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'sister', 'Pauline', 'wedding.Pauline', 'went', 'bad', 'divorce', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'daughter', 'union', 'was', 'extremely', 'insecure', 'andunraveled', 'end', 'marriage', 'met', 'Malcolm', 'who', 'somewhat', 'work', 'musician', 'who', 'laugh', 'confidence.They', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'married', '.Normal', 'enough', 'right', 'Should', 'be', 'nice', 'family', 'gathering', 'lots', 'good', 'memories', 'smiles', 'Oh', 'Not', 'Margot', 'involved', 'not', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'simple', 'Margot.She', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'people', 'run', 'other', 'side', 'street', 'when', 'see', 'coming.She', 'also', 'spread', 'rumors', 'people', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'all.To', 'top', 'everything', 'everyone', 'else', 'most', 'razor', 'sharp', 'way', 'imaginable', 'success', 'attack', 'people', 'Even', 'complete', 'strangers', 'esp', 'family.Margot', 'also', 'unhappy', 'sister', 'marrying', 'Malcolm', 'played', 'Jack', 'Black', 'who', 'common', 'also', 'jealous', 'sister', 'happiness', 'Margot', 'own', 'marriage', 'rocky', 'tries', 'ruin', 'wedding', 'causing', 'drama', 'almost', 'might', 'not', 'likeThis', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'have', 'difficult', 'relatives', 'holidays', 'hellish', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'Margot', 'poor', 'Family', 'having', 'deal', 'insufferable', 'woman.The', 'lighting', 'kind', 'grainyWhat', 'liked', 'itThe', 'performancesJack', 'Black', 'normal', 'guy', 'who', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'nice', 'difficult', 'sister', 'law.He', ""n't"", 'totally', 'funny', 'totally', 'serious', 'different', 'anything', 'done.He', 'cries', 'frustrated', 'course', 'laugh', 'too.He', 'best', 'one', 'liners', 'whole', 'movie.It', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Fast', 'times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'again', '.The', 'bottom', 'LineNo', 'one', 'could', 'played', 'part', 'Margot', 'made', 'interested', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Nicole', 'Margot', 'layers', 'What', 'mean', 'Margot', 'just', 'not', 'terrible', 'person', 'lot', 'layers', 'Kidman', 'layers', 'superb', 'acting', 'skills.It', 'hope', 'Margot', 'how', 'ugly', 'people', 'make', 'right', 'ones', 'who', 'count.But', 'doubt', 'ever', 'will.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'recomend', 'everyone', 'have', 'mother-in-law', 'aunt', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'movie', 'maybe', 'get', 'courage', 'tell', 'stop', 'causing', 'so', 'much', 'unneeded', 'carnage']",N/A

She pretends to be supportive, but divulges her sister's pregnancy secret to her 11 year old son in one of their talks that sound more like husband and wife conversations rather than mother and son. Margot's run away from her husband to be with an old university lover who just happens to live near her sister, and she's scheduled a talk at a local book store to promote her work. There's also the underlying suspicion that Margot may just be around to cull her family's pain to fill a few more pages in her writer's notebook.I've read the negative reviews here and I'll concede that this is a heady movie. Margot is intelligent and caustic. If you think Annie Hall was irritating, you'll find even fewer in-roads into Margot's character. Margot is vulnerable for five seconds in this film-when she divulges her plans to move near her lover-which makes the ending of the film even more endearing. I don't agree with the reviews that commented ""people don't talk this way"" because well, ummm, my family does. I thought this was an intelligent and well written script.Jennifer Jason Leigh's character tells Margot's son that ""it's hard to find people in the world you love as much as your family"". This family suffers from some dysfunction but they also are blessed with having the kind of relationships that are so intimate they're soul changing. I think the director and writer did a wonderful job of capturing this family relationship. But I loved Annie Hall too.

It follows a family reunion (before a wedding we never get to see) and looks at the dysfunctional relationship between two sisters and between a mother and her son. The acting is OK, but not fantastic and the main issue with this film is that you have no idea what motivates the characters and makes them behave in the ways they do. Kidman's character is a cross between a bygone hippy and repressed neurotic, a very strange mix. You get glimpses of her `wild' past with talk of drug taking and casual sex and yet she seems so buttoned up and repressed as an adult it all becomes quite irrelevant. You never quite find out what happened to her to make her so objectionable and argumentative as an adult and it quickly gets tiresome to see her constantly snipe and complain to the other characters. Jack Black is quite good in a more serious role and it makes a refreshing change from the whooping and gurning in his more comedic roles. This is one of those film with no real beginning, storyline or ending and where as usually this makes for an endearing look at everyday life, here it came across as contrived and boring. From the trailers I saw of this I was expecting great things, almost a comedy type film, instead you get 88 minutes of turgid storyline, average acting and unsatisfying viewing.

1131970,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B0011NVC8Y,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[13, 22]","What sparks of promise Noah Baumbach showed in his quirky, yet entertaining indy romp, The Squid and the Whale, sputter out with his follow-up, dysfunctional family dramady, Margot at the Wedding. Merely a retread of themes and material, Baumbach reaches for something deeper, but only manages to unearth a pretentious and ugly piece of misfired art.After years of separation, Margot (Nicole Kidman) returns to her childhood home for her sister's wedding. Filled with dark and troubling secrets, Margot seems to have a knack at bringing out the worst in people, yet she is never able to truly comprehend her own flaws. In Margot's eyes her sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is above the life she has allotted herself. Also something is obviously ""off"" about her sister's unemployed husband-to-be (Jack Black). Her son, who she sometimes finds charming and funny, is lazy and ridden with body odor. She even cheats on her charming and caring husband (John Turturro) because his kind deeds make her feel awful about herself.Likeable characters are not the strong suit of Margot at the Wedding, yet attracting audiences to these incredibly selfish individuals doesn't seem to be Baumbach's initiative. Rather the director seems to be intent on showing the destructiveness of these characters, not only on themselves, but on their troubled offspring. Many of the violent outbursts the adults throw are staged right in front of child actors Zane Pais and Flora Cross, which is an obviously deliberate directorial choice, especially upon comparison to the themes present in Baumbach's previous effort.Production values are equally unattractive. While the handheld camerawork is surprisingly apt, the decision to use natural lighting makes the film all the more difficult to watch. With muted browns dominating the majority of the picture's color palate and backlight which casts heavy shadows over the actor's faces, the production definitely needed a Hollywood producer to shout, ""More fill light!"" With the flat audio to boot, the actors' raw and naked performances are lost to ugly cinematography.While Jack Black has proven his acting chops in pictures like King Kong and The Holiday, his sarcastic, deadbeat performance only works in spurts here. When Black is forced to abandon his trademark, smarmy dialogue and physical body language, prodded by Baumbach to deliver real emotion, the actor's performance approaches ridiculousness.Margot at the Wedding is filled with symbolism that is either too overt or entirely unfinished. Representing their childhood youth, the tree that adorns the sister's ocean view, backyard obviously symbolizes happier times for the siblings. When Kidman climbs the tree, arguably one of the only truly entertaining moments in the picture, her fear of falling certainly displays a departure from the adventurous spirit she once had as a child. The tree continues its symbolic presence throughout the film, but other more bizarre threads, such as the evil neighbors and their sacrificial rituals performed in the buff, are left open ended.Not only are symbols left unfulfilled, but loose editing also alienates viewers, ending scenes abruptly. While this works in fits, notably when Jack Black first appears or, again, when Kidman climbs the proverbial tree, the majority of the editing feels quite amateurish..Had the film not starred big names like Nicole Kidman and Jack Black, there wouldn't be much separating Margot at the Wedding from a pretentious and overwrought student production. The movie tries so hard to say something important, but it only succeeds in rendering its audiences numb.-Joe Russo",1,Margot at the Wedding Movie Review,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,3639,"['What', 'promise', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'showed', 'quirky', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'indy', 'romp', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'sputter', 'out', 'follow-up', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'dramady', 'Margot', 'Wedding', 'Merely', 'retread', 'themes', 'material', 'Baumbach', 'something', 'deeper', 'only', 'unearth', 'pretentious', 'ugly', 'piece', 'misfired', 'art.After', 'years', 'separation', 'Margot', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'childhood', 'home', 'sister', 'wedding', 'Filled', 'dark', 'troubling', 'secrets', 'Margot', 'have', 'knack', 'bringing', 'out', 'worst', 'people', 'never', 'able', 'truly', 'comprehend', 'own', 'flaws', 'Margot', 'eyes', 'sister', 'Pauline', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'life', 'allotted', 'Also', 'something', 'obviously', 'sister', 'unemployed', 'husband-to-be', 'Jack', 'Black', 'son', 'who', 'sometimes', 'charming', 'funny', 'lazy', 'ridden', 'body', 'odor', 'even', 'cheats', 'charming', 'caring', 'husband', 'John', 'Turturro', 'kind', 'deeds', 'make', 'feel', 'awful', 'herself.Likeable', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'strong', 'suit', 'Margot', 'Wedding', 'yet', 'attracting', 'audiences', 'incredibly', 'selfish', 'individuals', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'Baumbach', 'initiative', 'director', 'be', 'intent', 'showing', 'destructiveness', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'troubled', 'offspring', 'Many', 'violent', 'adults', 'throw', 'are', 'staged', 'right', 'front', 'child', 'actors', 'Zane', 'Pais', 'Flora', 'Cross', 'obviously', 'deliberate', 'directorial', 'choice', 'especially', 'comparison', 'themes', 'present', 'Baumbach', 'previous', 'effort.Production', 'values', 'are', 'equally', 'unattractive', 'handheld', 'camerawork', 'surprisingly', 'apt', 'decision', 'use', 'natural', 'lighting', 'film', 'more', 'difficult', 'watch', 'muted', 'browns', 'dominating', 'majority', 'picture', 'color', 'palate', 'backlight', 'heavy', 'shadows', 'actor', 'production', 'definitely', 'needed', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'shout', 'More', 'fill', 'light', 'flat', 'audio', 'boot', 'actors', 'raw', 'naked', 'performances', 'are', 'lost', 'ugly', 'cinematography.While', 'Jack', 'Black', 'proven', 'acting', 'chops', 'pictures', 'King', 'Kong', 'Holiday', 'sarcastic', 'deadbeat', 'performance', 'only', 'spurts', 'here', 'When', 'Black', 'forced', 'abandon', 'trademark', 'smarmy', 'dialogue', 'physical', 'body', 'language', 'prodded', 'Baumbach', 'deliver', 'real', 'emotion', 'actor', 'performance', 'approaches', 'ridiculousness.Margot', 'Wedding', 'filled', 'symbolism', 'either', 'too', 'overt', 'entirely', 'unfinished', 'Representing', 'childhood', 'youth', 'tree', 'sister', 'ocean', 'view', 'backyard', 'obviously', 'happier', 'times', 'siblings', 'When', 'Kidman', 'tree', 'arguably', 'one', 'only', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'picture', 'fear', 'falling', 'certainly', 'departure', 'adventurous', 'spirit', 'once', 'had', 'child', 'tree', 'symbolic', 'presence', 'film', 'other', 'more', 'bizarre', 'threads', 'such', 'evil', 'neighbors', 'sacrificial', 'rituals', 'performed', 'buff', 'are', 'left', 'open', 'ended.Not', 'only', 'are', 'symbols', 'left', 'unfulfilled', 'loose', 'editing', 'also', 'viewers', 'ending', 'scenes', 'abruptly', 'fits', 'notably', 'when', 'Jack', 'Black', 'first', 'again', 'when', 'Kidman', 'proverbial', 'tree', 'majority', 'editing', 'feels', 'quite', 'amateurish..Had', 'film', 'not', 'starred', 'big', 'names', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Jack', 'Black', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'separating', 'Margot', 'Wedding', 'pretentious', 'overwrought', 'student', 'production', 'movie', 'so', 'hard', 'say', 'something', 'important', 'only', 'rendering', 'audiences', 'numb.-Joe', 'Russo']",N/A

Margot does not realise how manipulative she could be and her sibling, with the encouragement of her husband decided to break free to finally put an end to her meddling, only to have it transferred to her nephew.....Nicole Kidman, Joe Black, Jennifer Jason Leigh, all put in good performances.  Black was surprisingly, constraint and non comedic in this role.  Kidman as Margot, is not the glamorous actress I imagine her to be, her portrayal was truly down-to-earth and quite believable.As for Jennifer Jason Leigh, I caught glimpses of her late father's emotions transmitted through her eyes, it is like watching Vic Morrow in an episode in Combat, ""The Linesman"" where he gave the same look to Jack Lord's character.
