The chemistry between Christy Carlson Romano and Ross Thomas was really good in my opinion.  I'm drawn to sweet movies, no matter how corny or stupid they are.

Christy Carlson Romano has never been one of my favorite actresses, even when she used to be on ""Even Stevens"" on Disney Channel, but this movie really showcased that she really does have talent.

958807,A3GA09FYFKL4EY,B000CGXLTE,Fruit Loop,"[27, 34]","I was extremely disappointed in this movie both as a skater and a fan of ""The Cutting Edge."" The first negative was believability; #1 took place at the Albertville Games, but here Kate and Doug are middle-aged parents of Olympic hopeful Jackie. They didn't even bother to cast the original actors (the extremely likable and photogenic Moira Kelly and DB Sweeney) and TRY to make them up to look older; we get Scott Thompson Baker, the wooden-faced soap opera actor, as the dad. Strike 2.The producers didn't do their homework either. While it's true that many skaters do turn to pairs because of the increased emphasis on jumps, their presentation of having Jackie and Alex break new ground by doing side-by-side triples is absurd. Pair skaters have not only done triples in their programs for the last quarter century, they're a *necessity* for any world class pair team now. Some teams are even attempting throw quadruple jumps. Hollywood, do your homework if you're going to do a movie aimed at figure skating fans! Strike 3. And, like their parents, Jackie and Alex do a move invented for the camera: the overhead throw twist while Alex does a triple toe loop jump beneath. Pretty, but not possible.One of the worst parts for me was having Alex continually sleep with his old girlfriend although he's supposed to be in love with Jackie. He comes off looking like a jerk instead of a real hero, and Jackie just smiles and takes him back. (Doesn't anybody in the movies worry about AIDS, STDs, or fidelity anymore) Big strike 4.The movie has its moments, but it's nowhere near as fun as the original. Cutting Edge was so much fun we could suspend belief (hockey player becoming a world class skater so fast, the secret weapon move that's in reality impossible) but #2 doesn't deliver.

958813,A2A9BGJ6FFBBDT,B000CGXLTE,"Magalini Sabina ""sabina""","[0, 1]","Skating movies are favourites of mine, so the treat of a skating film is a real joy. If you compare ""The Cutting Edge - Going for the Gold"" to its 1992 parent movie, it comes out pretty bad. The actors, the dialogues, the scenography are inferior and the plot is practically just the same.However, since movies represent our reality, I want to point out how this work sensibly depicts the problems of adolescence our children are going through. This short sociological and psychological analysis represents my personal opinion and far from me the desire to generalize.Jackie is the daughter of Kate Mosely and Doug Dorsey, ex Olympic-gold pair figure skaters. She is determined, stubborn, focused and not willing to give up an inch in attaining her goal. Alex is an athletic, somewhat displaced, not determined, easy going young man. Modern adolescents are exactly like this. Girls today have a greater drive to success and a steadier determination in attaing results. They are not quitters. Fifteen years before Jackie's mother had been the one that had thought of quitting because of love problems.Boys on the other hand are more concerned with their well being, physical form and are less focused on short term goals. When they dont succeed in their dreams, they willingly change objective and carry on.Fortunately, the director or the writer, has shown how family is the only barrier against the loss of projects and motivations, how it counsels, sustains and reinforces outlooks on life or how it simply shows the young guys how to live a successfull and satisfying life.In the parent movie (1992) both the character's families represented a handicap to their evolution and the expression of their emotions, in 2006 the family plays instead a leading role in their success.Some skating scenes are unrealistic, as accurately pointed out by others. But it is interesting to see how this sport is seen in a wider athletic approach to life, with intermingling to in-line rollerskating and surfing. This mixture of athletic disciplines is present also in other movies such as the entertaining ""Stick It"" or ""The Lords of Dogtown"".Both the leading actors are talented, modern and effectively interact.This movie is not a classic like the original, but in the line or remakes it does present some interesting characteristics and it is entertaing to see.",3,"Figure skating and adolescence.

958817,A3N1H8BSULHP3U,B000CGXLTE,Nikki S.,"[4, 6]","I'm always disappointed in sequels, so the poor quality of this particular movie was no surprise.  It was obviously low budget (costumes & sets were unimpressive and looked nothing like actual skating competitions) & targeted for a younger audience (characters and dialogue were typical of a teen movie).  The plot of this movie closely paralleled the first - professional female skater paired with athlete with no figure-skating experience, chemistry between the two is shattered by another woman, they fight and make up only to fight again, and a declaration of love is made just seconds before their Olympic program begins - to the extent that it was very unoriginal and predictable.  The characters were younger and more irresponsible, and there was very little depth to them or their relationship. Jackie was completely stuck-up and disrespectful to her parents (much much worse than Moira Kelly's character, who at least evolved by the end of the first movie!), which really irritated me.  It seems to me the movie was made simply to make a profit by riding on the coattails of the first one, which was a phenomenal success.If you don't compare this movie to the original, you may find its an ok teen movie, but I don't think any figure skating movie could take the place of the original Cutting Edge.  Had they used characters from the original cast (to play the parents in this movie), worked a little harder on the script, and had an increased budget, the sequel could have been alot better.",2,No comparison to the original,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,1500,"[""'m"", 'always', 'disappointed', 'sequels', 'poor', 'quality', 'particular', 'movie', 'was', 'surprise', 'was', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'costumes', 'sets', 'were', 'unimpressive', 'looked', 'nothing', 'actual', 'skating', 'competitions', 'targeted', 'younger', 'audience', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'were', 'typical', 'teen', 'movie', 'plot', 'movie', 'closely', 'paralleled', 'first', 'professional', 'female', 'skater', 'paired', 'athlete', 'figure-skating', 'experience', 'chemistry', 'two', 'shattered', 'woman', 'fight', 'make', 'up', 'only', 'fight', 'again', 'declaration', 'love', 'made', 'just', 'seconds', 'Olympic', 'program', 'extent', 'was', 'very', 'unoriginal', 'predictable', 'characters', 'were', 'younger', 'more', 'irresponsible', 'there', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'depth', 'relationship', 'Jackie', 'was', 'completely', 'stuck-up', 'disrespectful', 'parents', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'character', 'who', 'least', 'evolved', 'end', 'first', 'movie', 'really', 'irritated', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'simply', 'make', 'profit', 'riding', 'coattails', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'success.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'movie', 'original', 'may', 'find', 'ok', 'teen', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'figure', 'skating', 'movie', 'could', 'take', 'place', 'original', 'Cutting', 'Edge', 'Had', 'used', 'characters', 'original', 'cast', 'play', 'parents', 'movie', 'worked', 'little', 'harder', 'script', 'had', 'increased', 'budget', 'sequel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'better']",N/A

Pulliam ""no lemming, I""","[40, 63]","The original ""The Cutting Edge"" is probably the best movie ever made with figure skating as a central theme.This ""remake/sequel"" is laughable/dismal/awful.One big negative for me is the handling of competition itself.  NO COMPETITION IS DONE WITH FOLLOW SPOTS.  EVER.  It's always held in a fully lighted arena.As someone else pointed out, pairs have been doing side-by-side triples for a couple of decades, at the very least.  To make it a central issue for the coach to worry about is ludicrous.  That's l-u-d-i-c-r-o-u-s.Another negative is that the skating is dismal...the closeups are unconvincing and the long-shot looks at the skaters doing the difficult elements are bland...nothing difficult at all...no variety on the lifts...no speed...nothing that would place the central team very highly in any grouping of pairs...unless they were all as dismal.This is cheapjack filmmaking by amateurs with no incentive to research their topic or to find believable actors/actresses...or, at least, anyone with chemistry.  There's no imagination at work here...no creativity.It truly grieves me that the people involved in this project were paid extremely well to deliver this...crap.It IS hackwork of a high order, though.

958820,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B000CGXLTE,S. Der,"[0, 0]","I love skating movie and have seen all 4 movies. Would anyone had guess this title would get 3 sequel!?!?! I didn't. I honestly didn't know there was, but I just finished watching all 3 sequels today. Out of the 3 movie sequels, I felt this one is the best sequel!Let me first start off by saying, I don't mind watching the same movie plot thrown at me. At least these movies were under the same name. Other movies will try to copy or steal other movies plot's, but these movies have the right to do so. That's why I watched all 3 sequels. I knew that they were going to just do the same thing as the original, but with different lead actors. I don't mind that. I watched this movie for the chemistry and see if the actors are believe able and the skating.Now, the acting was great. I really believed the main actors were in love with each other and really had a hard time trying to find the right mix of love and work. Christy Carlson Romano really played a very believable Jackie Dorsey. She really made me believe she was hurt and had a hard time getting back into skating. Ross Thomas played Alex well. He looked and sounded like a strong athletic that could master figure skating by just working really hard at it. Together they made the movie come alive. Jackie's mom and dad played their roles well, especially the mom as the coach.I felt this movie did the most to show much team work is needed to become great pair skaters out of all the sequels. It started at Regionals to Nationals and finally the Olympics. This is also the movie that showed the most skating. The rests of the sequel did not have nearly enough skating compared to this movie. This movie also did have a finisher move that wasn't talked about or builded up to end the movie. It just happened and it was so awesome to watch. Alex throws Jackie into the air and she does a spin, while Alex does a spain right below her at the same time. Jackie ends up landing into Alex's arms at the end to finish off the move. This was way better than the Pamchenko.If you are going to watch any Cutting Edge sequels, this is the sequel you need to watch. You can forget the rest because nothing beats this one.",5,My most favorite sequel!,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,2172,"['love', 'skating', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', '4', 'movies', 'Would', 'anyone', 'had', 'guess', 'title', 'would', 'get', '3', 'sequel', 'did', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', '3', 'sequels', 'today', '3', 'movie', 'sequels', 'felt', 'one', 'best', 'sequel', 'Let', 'first', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'plot', 'thrown', 'least', 'movies', 'were', 'same', 'name', 'Other', 'movies', 'will', 'try', 'copy', 'steal', 'other', 'movies', 'plot', 'movies', 'have', 'right', 'do', 'so', 'why', 'watched', '3', 'sequels', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'just', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'original', 'different', 'lead', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watched', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'see', 'actors', 'are', 'believe', 'able', 'skating.Now', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'really', 'believed', 'main', 'actors', 'were', 'love', 'other', 'really', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'right', 'mix', 'love', 'work', 'Christy', 'Carlson', 'Romano', 'really', 'played', 'very', 'believable', 'Jackie', 'Dorsey', 'really', 'made', 'believe', 'was', 'hurt', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'back', 'skating', 'Ross', 'Thomas', 'played', 'Alex', 'well', 'looked', 'sounded', 'strong', 'athletic', 'could', 'master', 'figure', 'skating', 'just', 'working', 'really', 'hard', 'Together', 'made', 'movie', 'come', 'alive', 'Jackie', 'mom', 'dad', 'played', 'roles', 'well', 'especially', 'mom', 'coach.I', 'felt', 'movie', 'did', 'most', 'show', 'much', 'team', 'work', 'needed', 'become', 'great', 'pair', 'skaters', 'sequels', 'started', 'Regionals', 'Nationals', 'finally', 'Olympics', 'also', 'movie', 'showed', 'most', 'skating', 'rests', 'sequel', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'nearly', 'enough', 'skating', 'compared', 'movie', 'movie', 'also', 'did', 'have', 'finisher', 'move', 'was', ""n't"", 'talked', 'builded', 'up', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'happened', 'was', 'so', 'awesome', 'watch', 'Alex', 'Jackie', 'air', 'spin', 'Alex', 'spain', 'right', 'same', 'time', 'Jackie', 'up', 'landing', 'Alex', 'arms', 'end', 'finish', 'off', 'move', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'Pamchenko.If', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'Cutting', 'Edge', 'sequels', 'sequel', 'need', 'watch', 'can', 'forget', 'rest', 'nothing', 'beats', 'one']",N/A

I wathed this film hoping that it would have a bit of the fun that made the first film so memorable. And i must say i really enjoyed it. If you want great skating in a film hire a pro figure skater for the part and don't expect great acting. Christy Carlson Romano playes kate and Doug Dorseys daughter perfectly i thought she had a lot of the fire you would expect from kates daughter anyone remember what a pain kate could be in the first film give credit where credit is due she did a great job. the parents (Doug and Kate) did great i thought it was better with these actors Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney just would not have been the right age for this film yet cutting edge just came out 14 years ago and i'm guessing that their daughter is alot older than 14. Give this film a chance if you enjoyed cutting edge for it's humor and fun suprises and are not concerned with everything being by the book and identical to how it would play out in real life and can forgive the director for perhaps oh my goodness adding a bit of hollywood magic to the film then give it a shot you may just find yourself enjoying it.",5,Give it a shot people are way to critical with this film.,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,1249,"['i', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'how', 'bad', 'skating', 'was', 'how', 'terrible', 'chemistry', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'wathed', 'film', 'hoping', 'would', 'have', 'bit', 'fun', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'memorable', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'i', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'want', 'great', 'skating', 'film', 'hire', 'pro', 'figure', 'skater', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'acting', 'Christy', 'Carlson', 'Romano', 'playes', 'kate', 'Doug', 'Dorseys', 'daughter', 'perfectly', 'i', 'thought', 'had', 'lot', 'fire', 'would', 'expect', 'kates', 'daughter', 'anyone', 'remember', 'what', 'pain', 'kate', 'could', 'be', 'first', 'film', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'parents', 'Doug', 'Kate', 'did', 'great', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'actors', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'age', 'film', 'yet', 'cutting', 'edge', 'just', 'came', 'out', '14', 'years', 'ago', 'i', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'daughter', 'alot', 'older', '14', 'Give', 'film', 'chance', 'enjoyed', 'cutting', 'edge', 'humor', 'fun', 'suprises', 'are', 'not', 'concerned', 'everything', 'being', 'book', 'identical', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'forgive', 'director', 'perhaps', 'oh', 'goodness', 'adding', 'bit', 'hollywood', 'magic', 'film', 'then', 'give', 'shot', 'may', 'just', 'find', 'enjoying']",N/A
