Just as you are getting to care about these people and want to see more of them, the series was ended. The fault of production costs or something. I felt the same way about The Brief...I wanted more !I am still glad to have it among my other Alan Davies dvd's, Jonathan Creek, The Brief and the only three seasons (unfortunately) of QI put on dvd.",5,Excellent !!,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,464,"['What', 'wonderful', 'show', '.and', 'just', 'poof', 'gone', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'showed', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'Just', 'are', 'getting', 'care', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'series', 'was', 'ended', 'fault', 'production', 'costs', 'something', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'Brief', 'wanted', 'more', 'am', 'still', 'glad', 'have', 'other', 'Alan', 'Davies', 'dvd', 'Jonathan', 'Creek', 'Brief', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'unfortunately', 'QI', 'put', 'dvd']",N/A

I'm not going to bore you with another review of the show, there are some really good ones here, just know that it may take a couple of episodes to really get into it but after 2-3 you will be hooked and even liking the characters, no matter how dislikeable they can be.",5,"Smart, Witty and irreverent",1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,342,"['character', 'development', 'awesome', 'shame', 'gone', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'bore', 'review', 'show', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'ones', 'here', 'just', 'know', 'may', 'take', 'couple', 'episodes', 'really', 'get', '2-3', 'will', 'be', 'hooked', 'even', 'liking', 'characters', 'matter', 'how', 'dislikeable', 'can', 'be']",N/A
1407969,A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9,B004H3F6XW,"NyiNya ""NyiNya""","[3, 4]","""Whites"" is funny, satirical and absolutely enjoyable look at what happens to a celebrity chef who hits the wall.  Ronald White used to be a contender. Once a rising young chef, he is now scruffy, overweight and chainsmoking his way from one meal service to the next at a no-star hotel kitchen.This is a man who is no longer young, who no longer cares, and who knows that he has been left in the dust by Gordon Ramsay and the other rockstars of British cookery...most of whom he apprenticed with and a couple of whom he trained. He's lost his taste for cooking and spends most of his time avoiding the kitchen while pretending to write a cookbook.Bib, his sous chef is long-suffering as all sous chefs should be. There is a ditzy waitress who is ditzy in such a good and original way, it redeems her and renews the genre. Katherine Parkinson, who is always good and excelled in her role as the receptionist on Doc Martin, is the restaurant manager. She is, of course, in love with White, who somewhat returns her feelings but still chases whatever comes by with boobs and long legs. My favorite character is a truly villanous apprentice. He wants to be the next Jamie Oliver and is willing to stick his Sabatier into anyone's back to get there.The stories are entertaining, the dialogue top quality and the acting first rate. The only negative...just one season was filmed. A darn shame because you're left wanting a second helping.  Five stars for a well-written and well produced effort that does not talk down to its audience.In 2005, ""Kitchen Confidential,"" a sitcom very loosely (try in name only) based on Anthony Bourdain's book, aired for a single season. It's not a bad effort, but if you watch both, the difference between British and US tv is obvious.  The British version is strictly for grownups. Apparently their audiences don't need resolution and a a happy ending every 30 minutes, and they don't always go for the broadest humor. The U.S. version relies on sexual situations for most of its plots and much of its humor.  Yeah, its funny, sort of, but it can't compare to ""White's.""  That show is certainly not averse to the risque...or even the out and out raunchy. They just do it in a funnier and more original way and don't aim every joke at the sixteen year old boys in the audience.  Something U.S. television might consider.",5,"Waiter, There's a Fly in the Ointment",1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,2347,"['Whites', 'funny', 'satirical', 'absolutely', 'enjoyable', 'look', 'what', 'celebrity', 'chef', 'who', 'wall', 'Ronald', 'White', 'used', 'be', 'contender', 'rising', 'young', 'chef', 'now', 'scruffy', 'overweight', 'chainsmoking', 'way', 'one', 'meal', 'service', 'next', 'no-star', 'hotel', 'kitchen.This', 'man', 'who', 'longer', 'young', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'cares', 'who', 'been', 'left', 'dust', 'Gordon', 'Ramsay', 'other', 'rockstars', 'British', 'cookery', 'most', 'whom', 'apprenticed', 'couple', 'whom', 'trained', 'lost', 'taste', 'cooking', 'most', 'time', 'avoiding', 'kitchen', 'pretending', 'write', 'cookbook.Bib', 'sous', 'chef', 'long-suffering', 'sous', 'chefs', 'should', 'be', 'ditzy', 'waitress', 'who', 'ditzy', 'such', 'good', 'original', 'way', 'renews', 'genre', 'Katherine', 'Parkinson', 'who', 'always', 'good', 'excelled', 'role', 'receptionist', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'restaurant', 'manager', 'course', 'love', 'White', 'who', 'somewhat', 'feelings', 'still', 'boobs', 'long', 'legs', 'favorite', 'character', 'truly', 'villanous', 'apprentice', 'be', 'next', 'Jamie', 'Oliver', 'willing', 'stick', 'Sabatier', 'anyone', 'back', 'get', 'there.The', 'stories', 'are', 'entertaining', 'dialogue', 'top', 'quality', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'only', 'negative', 'just', 'one', 'season', 'was', 'filmed', 'darn', 'shame', ""'re"", 'left', 'wanting', 'second', 'helping', 'Five', 'stars', 'well-written', 'well', 'produced', 'effort', 'not', 'talk', 'audience.In', '2005', 'Kitchen', 'Confidential', 'sitcom', 'very', 'loosely', 'try', 'name', 'only', 'based', 'Anthony', 'Bourdain', 'book', 'aired', 'single', 'season', 'not', 'bad', 'effort', 'watch', 'difference', 'British', 'US', 'tv', 'obvious', 'British', 'version', 'strictly', 'grownups', 'Apparently', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'resolution', 'happy', 'ending', '30', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'go', 'broadest', 'humor', 'U.S.', 'version', 'relies', 'sexual', 'situations', 'most', 'plots', 'much', 'humor', 'Yeah', 'funny', 'sort', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'White', 'show', 'certainly', 'not', 'averse', 'risque', 'even', 'out', 'raunchy', 'just', 'do', 'funnier', 'more', 'original', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'aim', 'joke', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'audience', 'Something', 'U.S.', 'television', 'might', 'consider']",N/A
