I kept wanting to yell at the screen, ""Say something right, dumby!""  The four stars are due to the ending.  I just don't understand why nothing was ever said about the reason for his wife being there.  The ending therefore goes into the ""moving on"" stage, and the relationships never quite end.

Boy, who has met and married girl, meets boy and falls in love but stays with girl until the secret is revealed.  Then boy loses everything in a dramatic and crushing way.  In 1989 East Berlin, I would guess that this is how gay men were treated.  Only guessing though.

581233,ANMJJITAF8PUG,B00005BH25,"Cambel ""cambel""","[15, 17]","One of the most facinating aspects of this movie is that is was filmed in East Germany before the fall of communism yet is more frank about the gay aspect than many gay films made in the west today.  though interesting, the location of the movie took a backseat to the storyling.the main character is a handsome teacher working in a highschool in East Berlin,  he becomes reaquainted with a woman he knew in college and starts to date her.  Later in the movie, he has a shock when one of her friends turns out to be a childhood pal of his, and somebody that he used to have strong feelings for.  this encounter reawakens these feelings as well as his nervousness about them.  he takes the step of going to a gay bar.  this seems to be the end of it until later in the city he bumps into a young man who recognized him from the bar, there is a chemestry between them which them becomes complicated because of his relationship with his girlfriend.  the striking thing about the movie is that it didn't dwell overly much on the tragic aspects although it pointed out the wrongheadedness of not being honest with the people in your life.  In the end it gave you the feeling that the man was going to land on his feet and is a film I would recomend.

581234,A342YAXL116N5A,B00005BH25,Dennis!,"[22, 23]","Maybe it's the fact that it's an ""indie"" film and it's supposed to be ""trendy.""  Or maybe it's that it's foreign.  But what's with films that just *end* before you get anywhere?Set in East Berlin before the fall of the Wall, the movie starts off with Mathias getting his stomach pumped, and we eventually learn that he's attempted suicide because he's gay.  That's the last we see of Mathias for a bit, and instead we start focusing on Philipp, a high school teacher.Philipp, however, clearly has issues with his sexuality.  He gets himself a girlfriend to present to the world his heterosexuality, but, having been led into an underground gay bar, his latent tendencies erupt and become irrepressible.  He eventually meets Mathias, who quickly becomes the object not just of his lust, but his genuine affection as well.The story is a compelling one, and not just because it takes place in East Berlin - I know plenty of people here in the States who have problems with their own homosexuality and end up doing what Philipp does.  The characters transcend national borders.  They're people.The acting is impressive.  Philipp clearly is tormented, and the viewer can feel the pull and pressures of his life grating on him.  Repression is a terrible thing.Where the movie loses it for me is its substantial lack of focus and drive.  So many loose ends that aren't adequately explained.  Words to ponder after the movie has run its course:  What happens to:  Marriage?  Baby?  Job?  Mother? Mathias?  Philipp?  With no apparent answer to any of these apparent questions, I was left a little empty.  Show me an ending!  Any ending!Moreover, the philosophizing becomes a bit much.  Between a former -- trick?  boyfriend? -- and the old man at the bar, the message came across a bit too heavy-handed.  Perhaps it's because, in the States now, we're more steeped in the rhetoric and (in some places) can be contentedly and confidently ""out.""  It was relevant back then, I'm sure, but now, it got a bit tiring.All in all, this movie was a decent effort, and entertaining for what it's worth.

581238,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005BH25,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","COMING OUT is a seventeen-year-old movie, created in East Germany while under Communist rule, about the dangerous milieu in which gay men closeted their identity.  It is a stunning achievement in that it presents the agony of coming to grips with sexual identity in a suppressive atmosphere, opening to public viewing the night the Berlin Wall tumbled.  With this knowledge the story of these people is all the more heartbreaking with the chance that life for each character would have been different if told a few months later!  The real tragedy is that the story is timeless and universal: the trauma of young people coming out is still potentially as wracked with anguish as the trauma of this film.Philipp (handsome young Matthias Freihof) is a popular high school teacher, tightly in the closet, who happens to bump into (literally) an open and needy pretty girl Tanya (Dagmar Manzel) who immediately invites him to her apartment and introduces him to her bed.  They form a comfortable bond, Philipp thinking his sexual identity problem is solved.  Then Tanya brings home an old friend, Redford, who Philipp instantly recognizes as a boy with whom he has had hidden sex in the past.  Old feelings are aroused and Philipp runs into the night only to end up in a secretive gay bar where he meets Matthias (handsome young Dirk Kummer) invites him home, and in a beautifully captured moment has a wholly satisfying physical encounter.  Both men are enraptured.Philipp returns to Tanya who questions his evenings' whereabouts and Philipp manages to keep his secret: the relationship suffers.  Philipp has meetings with his mother and during one of these meetings his mother tells him she is sure Tanya is pregnant: she has all the symptoms of morning sickness and 'a woman can tell'.  Philipp, though mortified, declares he will remain with Tanya, and at a party when the couple encounters Matthias (Philipp and Matthias greet each other with passion), Philipp introduces Tanya as his wife.  Matthias is shocked and hurt and  flees, and outraged Tanya discards Philipp.  Philipp roams the streets and parks looking for Matthias, realizing they can now be lovers, but doesn't find him.  He instead encounters one of his high school students Lutz (Robert Hummel) and has a one-night stand. In a sleazy gay bar Philipp meets an old man (brilliant actor Werner Dissel) who relates how life as a gay man during Hitler's reign had resulted in incarceration in a concentration camp, that gay men will always be persecuted.  Returning to his classroom Philipp is informed that he is under observation because of his sexual activity.  Struck by silence, Philipp stands before his class, his future unknown.This story by Wolfram Witt as directed by Heiner Carow is as fine as any relating the terrors of coming out.  That it is performed by such a fine cast is even more impressive, and the real banner that flies over this film is that it doesn't attempt to provide answers or maudlin endings.  It merely stops - leaving the futures of each of these well-drawn characters to the imagination of the audience.  It is powerful, it is well made, it is worthy of continued appreciation as a brave little film from another period in time, a period that continues into the present in so many places.  Highly recommended.

Thin characterizations, a decidedly underwritten script, fairly generic &quot;coming out&quot; situations, sluggish pace, confusing holes in the plot and incomplete story lines (what exactly happens to the baby the lead appears to have fathered with his girlfriend?) combine to make this film fall far short of its potential.  A climactic monologue delivered by an elderly survivor of the Pink Triangle and the concentration camps doesn't manage to lift the material to the level of seriousness to which it appears to aspire. (I found myself wishing they'd told the old man's story instead of this one.)  The erotic material, by today's &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; standards, is remarkably tame (although the lead is attractive enough) and certainly doesn't feel as ground-breaking as it may have when the film was released 12 years ago.

581241,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B00005BH25,Libretio,"[62, 64]","COMING OUT(E.Germany - 1989)Aspect ratio: 1.66:1Theatrical soundtrack: MonoDemonstrating that love can blossom unexpectedly even under the most adverse social conditions, the late Heiner Carow's award-winning and hugely impressive COMING OUT was filmed in communist East Berlin whilst homosexuality was still a criminal offence on that side of the Wall. Matthias Freihof plays a bright, attractive schoolteacher whose affair with a female colleague (Dagmar Manzel) is interrupted when Freihof falls in love with a beautiful young man (Dirk Kummer) whom he meets after stumbling into an illicit gay bar. Given that most gay teachers aren't exactly welcomed in even the most 'open' societies, it's inevitable that the enforced suppression of Freihof's true nature should result in the cruel deceit which he practices on the two people he loves most, with equally inevitable consequences if the truth should ever come out. In the end, it's left to an elderly patron of the gay bar (Werner Dissell) to put Freihof's problems into perspective by reminding him of a time in Germany fifty years earlier when things were much, MUCH  worse for gay people...Carow was a veteran writer-director whose career stretched back to the 1950s, but this was his first attempt to tackle the problems faced by gay people under his homeland's oppressive regime. Forsaking shrill melodrama for coolly understated realism, he simply points the camera at a superb cast of talented actors and allows them to develop their characters on the foundations of Wolfram Witt's excellent script: Freihof carries the picture as an essentially decent man whose fears of legal redress provides the linchpin of the entire narrative; Kummer is the romantic teenager whose tragic past sends him in search of true love (watch him carefully in the scene directly after his lovemaking with Freihof, when he asks if they will meet again - there is such hope and longing in his beautiful face); and Manzel is dignified in the thankless role of Freihof's uncomprehending girlfriend, the one with most to lose as a result of her lover's deceit.Filmed in and around some of the illegal gay bars which proliferated in East Berlin at the time, Carow charts the burgeoning romance between Freihof and Kummer with a tenderness that almost completely eludes the 'pretend' relationship with Manzel. But while the film is defiantly romantic at heart, it's also unflinchingly honest in its depiction of political repression at even the most basic level (in class, Freihof teaches individualism and freedom of thought, whilst concealing his sexual identity for fear of reprisals). As such, the film's conclusion may seem a little abrupt, even arbitrary, to some viewers, but it actually represents the true dawning of a whole new chapter for the central characters. In fact, Freihof's closing declaration - a single word, with countless implications - must have seemed especially liberating to those who caught the film's theatrical premiere in Germany on the same day the Berlin Wall came down, ending years of repression at a stroke. Long after the political tyrants of our world are gone, movies like this one will stand like stone, bearing witness to unkind history. A must-see.NB. Some interesting trivia: Firstly, though often cited as the first and only gay film from communist East Germany, COMING OUT was actually preceded by Wieland Speck's WESTLER (1985), a desperately awkward West German drama concerning a love affair between two young men living on opposite sides of the Wall, which utilized clandestine footage secretly recorded in East Berlin. And secondly, the medical staff in the opening sequence of COMING OUT are genuine, and poor Dirk Kummer appears to be having his stomach pumped FOR REAL!

581242,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00005BH25,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[1, 1]","Director Heiner Carow has crafted a long lost view of gay East Berlin before the fall of the wall. Despite the drab architecture and lack of color, Carow gives the viewer a virtual tour of East Berlin interlocked with the first and last gay themed film from that city. Matthias Freihof plays Philipp a closeted high School teacher who discovers he(tm)s gay while dating a woman. The plot is all too familiar and contains every clich one might think of in this type of tale. However, the simple place of the setting makes this one of the truly unique and individual gay themed films of the last century. Always matter of fact and straight to the point, Carow never fills a scene with unnecessary banter. Instead we have minimalist dialogue with characters that are truly human. The bar scenes are the true East Berlin ~cabaret(tm) and there is a variety of characters that interact to bring life to each scene. There are plenty of sexual scenes, but all are erotic in nature instead of pornographic. Towards the end, there is a pivotal scene with a remarkable older man who lectures Philipp while snorting a tray of brandy. This actor is amazing and completes the circle of the story with a mature perspective.

This excellent film, the only one produced by DEFA concerning homosexuality, seems to be a very accurate account of life in the East under Communism during the late 1980's. DEFA (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft) was the public-owned film studio in East Germany during East Germany's history.Without giving too much of the plot away, Phillip (Matthias Freihof) is a high school teacher who is soon involved with Tanya (Dagmar Manzel) and Phillip soon believes that his previous curiousity of men is behind him. Through various events we are then led to Phillip returning to his desire for men and it's consequences.There are terrific performances in this film throughout including that of the old man (Werner Dissel) in the bar at the end of the film.If it's a look at life under commumunism in East Germany's final days, or looking at how a guy deals with his sexual identity in such times, or you just want to see a decent German film, well this film is for you. Just short of two hours, the film is well worth a watch.

It is a surprisingly well done story of a closeted school teacher who becomes romantically involved with a female co-worker but then suppressed desires from his past begin to resurface when he meets a young man (Matthias) in a concert ticket line. He visits an underground gay bar and eventually becomes involved with Matthias but is torn by his true feelings and how his society will view him.The film has a haunting quality yet remains starkly realistic (the opening scene which depicts Matthias having his stomach pumped after a suicide attempt is quite graphic and disturbing). Most of the scenes are filmed on location in Berlin's gay bars, subways, streets, classrooms and houses. The sex scenes are not explicit yet very erotic and very well done. Overall, the film boasts excellent production values and performances and the dvd picture is sharp and colors are good.

There's nothing that screams COMMUNIST at you. The lead character is a young, good-looking, and well-built young man who is a school teacher. His students are easily in thrall to him, and you don't blame them. He seems passionate about his subject. It is interesting as what plays out in real life for him - his being torn between his girlfriend and a young man he is instantly attracted to - is played out in his classroom, as both a young woman and a young man are both obviously devoted to him. His interest in them is strictly professional, however, and despite his confusion of a heterosexual lifestyle or a homosexual one - and he believes he must choose, he cannot have it both ways. This in spite of his sexually functioning with both sexes. The mid-section of the film is about his being faced with this conundrum and the final part is about his decision and its consequences. A very good lead actor and actress, and though the sexual nature of this young man is the pivotable point of the story, I wished for more interraction between him and his students, as he seemed the type of teacher we all fantasize we wish we had when we were in school.
