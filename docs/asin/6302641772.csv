I have all seen nearly every single one of their feature films except for two; ""A Haunting-We-Will-Go"" and ""Jitterbugs"". Of their later efforts in the 40s I have always enjoyed them despite public opinion. ""Nothing But Trouble"", ""The Bullfighters"", the sadly condemned ""Utopia"" have all pleased me. But here with ""Air Raid Wardens"" I think ""the boys"" are working with the best material they had only for the first time I am able to say, I don't think the chemistry between the team was as strong as usual is and the film's pacing seems awkward.If ""Air Raid Wardens"" has been made merely five years earlier I think this could have much better.When I watch the later Laurel & Hardy films I miss certain things that were no longer available after they left Hal Roach. I miss the music, the supporting players were perfectly cast, even they had good chemistry with ""the boys"" the little touches really worked.After Hal Roach though we would never hear their famous theme song. I can't remember Hardy giving Stanley his famous, ""Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into"" line.But here with ""Air Raid Wardens"" it seemed the team was going to make up for things. The beginning is entertaining. Check out the town hall meeting with the dog. Their entrance reminded me of ""Sons of the Desert"" (When they walk in late) and the bit with the dog made me think of ""Laughing Gravy"".I also like their ""rescue"" seen where they have a fake victim they are suppose to help and end up turning him into a real victim.The film does make one mistake though. It presents Laurel & Hardy as simple-minded and ""the boys"" themselves acknowledge that. Never have Laurel & Hardy felt sorry for themselves. Even if everyone goes against them they always fought back.And although it's not really a mistake the plot is a little too light. There's not much there, but that can be forgiven. Here's the team that made a comedy masterpiece out of the simple idea of carrying a piano up stairs. None of their films were heavy on plot.Say what you will about Laurel & Hardy's later work, but I enjoy them, and ""Air Raid Wardens"" might have been their best of the decade.Bottom-line: Much better Laurel & Hardy film of the 40s, perehaps their best material after leaving Hal Roach. Has its problems but the film does its best to overcome them.",3,Homeland Security,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,2381,"['have', 'seen', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'short', 'subjects', '1930s', 'have', 'seen', 'nearly', 'single', 'one', 'feature', 'films', 'two', 'Haunting-We-Will-Go', 'Jitterbugs', 'later', 'efforts', '40s', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'public', 'opinion', 'Nothing', 'Trouble', 'Bullfighters', 'sadly', 'condemned', 'Utopia', 'have', 'pleased', 'here', 'Air', 'Raid', 'Wardens', 'think', 'boys', 'are', 'working', 'best', 'material', 'had', 'only', 'first', 'time', 'am', 'able', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'chemistry', 'team', 'was', 'as', 'strong', 'usual', 'film', 'pacing', 'Air', 'Raid', 'Wardens', 'been', 'made', 'merely', 'five', 'years', 'earlier', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'much', 'better.When', 'watch', 'later', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'films', 'miss', 'certain', 'things', 'were', 'longer', 'available', 'left', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'miss', 'music', 'supporting', 'players', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'even', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'boys', 'little', 'touches', 'really', 'worked.After', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'would', 'never', 'hear', 'famous', 'theme', 'song', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Hardy', 'giving', 'Stanley', 'famous', 'Well', 'here', 'nice', 'mess', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'line.But', 'here', 'Air', 'Raid', 'Wardens', 'seemed', 'team', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'up', 'things', 'beginning', 'entertaining', 'Check', 'town', 'hall', 'meeting', 'dog', 'entrance', 'reminded', 'Sons', 'Desert', 'When', 'walk', 'late', 'bit', 'dog', 'made', 'think', 'Laughing', 'Gravy', '.I', 'also', 'rescue', 'seen', 'where', 'have', 'fake', 'victim', 'are', 'suppose', 'help', 'end', 'up', 'turning', 'real', 'victim.The', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'mistake', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'simple-minded', 'boys', 'acknowledge', 'Never', 'have', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Even', 'everyone', 'always', 'fought', 'not', 'really', 'mistake', 'plot', 'little', 'too', 'light', 'not', 'much', 'there', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Here', 'team', 'made', 'comedy', 'masterpiece', 'simple', 'idea', 'carrying', 'piano', 'up', 'stairs', 'None', 'films', 'were', 'heavy', 'plot.Say', 'what', 'will', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'later', 'work', 'enjoy', 'Air', 'Raid', 'Wardens', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'decade.Bottom-line', 'Much', 'better', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'film', '40s', 'perehaps', 'best', 'material', 'leaving', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'Has', 'problems', 'film', 'best', 'overcome']",Air Raid Wardens VHS

There's no doubt this film was made during and about WWII, but even though a lot of the situations and jokes are the products of the specific time, they're quite funny and easy to understand.  Perhaps it's not quite as technically fine-tuned or tailor-made just for them as earlier movie masterpieces like 'A Chump at Oxford' and 'Pack Up Your Troubles' were, but there are a lot of funny moments in this.  It seems like so many people have said L&H;'s post-1940 films are unfunny/embarrassing/pathetic/etc. that people begin to believe it and never question it.  Yes, they're lacking that special magic that was present at Hal Roach Studios, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they were still quite funny and always did a great job with the material.  Some of the funniest moments include when they're ""helping"" pretend-victim Edgar Kennedy (wonderful to see him playing their slow burn foil again!), when they go into the city hall to receive their assignments, and when they're in Mr. Kennedy's house later on and get into a scuffle with him (the scuffle that leads them to be dismissed as air raid wardens).  I also immensely enjoyed the subplot about the Nazi spies who were planning to blow up the factory, and how the boys had to alert the townspeople somehow, even though they'd been dismissed as air raid wardens, and save the day in the end.  Sure it smacks of having been made during WWII, but I love books and movies about WWII.Still, there are little things in this movie that make my rating more like a 4.5 than a full 5, like how dumb Stan and Ollie are made out to be.  They've always been kinda dumb, and that's a large part of their appeal, but they were dumb in a sweet endearing way, like two overgrown little kids who didn't know any better, not dumb as in practically borderline retarded.  One of the jokes is supposed to be Stan struggling to write the four letters of his name on his air raid warden ID card; this is WAY stupider than they're supposed to be, and almost cruel to laugh over, like being asked to laugh at someone who's retarded and barely able to write one's name.  Ollie even says at one point, ""I guess we're not smart like other people.""  I'd strongly recommend this as one of their best post-1940 features and for someone who's into WWII, but not for someone who isn't familiar with the boys already.",5,Funny underappreciated WWII comedy,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,2745,"['books', 'movies', 'WWII', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'too', 'well', 'not', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'rather', 'material', 'humor', 'so', 'topical', ""n't"", 'make', 'modern', 'audience', 'laugh', 'relate', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'can', 'never', 'understand', 'jokes', 'get', 'subtle', 'references', 'just', 'understand', 'frame', 'mind', 'was', 'made', 'audiences', 'time', 'came', 'doubt', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'WWII', 'even', 'lot', 'situations', 'jokes', 'are', 'products', 'specific', 'time', ""'re"", 'quite', 'funny', 'easy', 'understand', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'quite', 'technically', 'fine-tuned', 'tailor-made', 'just', 'earlier', 'movie', 'masterpieces', 'Chump', 'Oxford', ""'Pack"", 'Up', 'Troubles', 'were', 'are', 'lot', 'funny', 'moments', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'L', 'H', 'post-1940', 'films', 'are', 'unfunny/embarrassing/pathetic/etc', 'people', 'begin', 'believe', 'never', 'question', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'lacking', 'special', 'magic', 'was', 'present', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'Studios', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'were', 'still', 'quite', 'funny', 'always', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'material', 'funniest', 'moments', 'include', 'when', ""'re"", 'helping', 'pretend-victim', 'Edgar', 'Kennedy', 'wonderful', 'see', 'playing', 'slow', 'burn', 'foil', 'again', 'when', 'go', 'city', 'hall', 'receive', 'assignments', 'when', ""'re"", 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', 'house', 'later', 'get', 'scuffle', 'scuffle', 'be', 'dismissed', 'air', 'raid', 'wardens', 'also', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'subplot', 'Nazi', 'spies', 'who', 'were', 'planning', 'blow', 'up', 'factory', 'how', 'boys', 'had', 'alert', 'townspeople', 'somehow', 'even', ""'d"", 'been', 'dismissed', 'air', 'raid', 'wardens', 'save', 'day', 'end', 'Sure', 'having', 'been', 'made', 'WWII', 'love', 'books', 'movies', 'WWII.Still', 'are', 'little', 'things', 'movie', 'make', 'rating', 'more', '4.5', 'full', '5', 'how', 'dumb', 'Stan', 'Ollie', 'are', 'made', 'out', 'be', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'kinda', 'dumb', 'large', 'part', 'appeal', 'were', 'dumb', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'way', 'two', 'overgrown', 'little', 'kids', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'not', 'dumb', 'practically', 'borderline', 'retarded', 'One', 'jokes', 'supposed', 'be', 'Stan', 'struggling', 'write', 'four', 'letters', 'name', 'air', 'raid', 'warden', 'ID', 'card', 'WAY', 'stupider', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'almost', 'cruel', 'laugh', 'being', 'asked', 'laugh', 'someone', 'who', 'retarded', 'barely', 'able', 'write', 'one', 'name', 'Ollie', 'even', 'one', 'point', 'guess', ""'re"", 'not', 'smart', 'other', 'people', ""'d"", 'strongly', 'recommend', 'one', 'best', 'post-1940', 'features', 'someone', 'who', 'WWII', 'not', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'boys', 'already']",Air Raid Wardens VHS

This film is perhaps a shade better than their previous efforts for Fox.
