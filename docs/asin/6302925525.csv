346270,AJASGOXDLFHR9,6302925525,Ace,"[2, 2]","THE WOMAN IN BLACK is a superior, though now obscure Haunted House thriller that I can say has some genuinely scary moments. As I recall this was a movie made for British TV in 1989. That said, don't expect a big budget, however, much of what was available was apparently lavished on the sets as this is a convincing period piece that retains the British yearning for quality and realism. I wish not to spoil the viewing experience for the uninitiated so I shall limit my comments accordingly. PROS: Setting, script, acting and some genuine scares including the appearance of the Ghost which was awe-inspiring. Someone must have been reading accounts of 19th century Hauntings as the apparition is spot on and those scenes really make you feel that you are witnessing the real thing. Very, very CREEPY. This is FAR more scarier than contemporary cinema Ghosts that usually wallow in CGI generated excesses. Those are fun to watch, this one chills the viewer to the bone. Cons: Ponderous & dialogue driven which may alienate some, especially young people as it fails to sustain continued interest. Although not a negative comment, the absence of gore may also inhibit young Horror fans from strapping this one on. That would be most unfortunate as this film works to keep your interest in other ways. Gore was not required in this film! Perhaps more of the budget should have been directed at producing an additional scene or two involving the ghost and her related manifestations. This would have remedied the slow pacing of the film. Some have said that the scariest moment in motion picture history is contained in this movie, with the inclusion of ""the scene"". After viewing, I think such will become readily apparent, though the final frames of the film were superior in my opinion. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is a serious ghost story done in the tradition of the original HAUNTING, The INNOCENTS, THE OTHERS and THE CHANGELING. Although not without flaws, I highly recommend it to all thoughtful film buffs, especially those who enjoy Horror. Docked one star for being too talky, though the film contains some 5 star elements.

And, man, can this woman haunt!  She is not confined to this locale either and can follow him wherever he goes. I don't want to tell you any more because I may ruin it for you.

346277,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,6302925525,Chip Kaufmann,"[4, 4]","...for ghost stories on video is this 1989 film made for British TV which was released on VHS in 1997 and on DVD in 2000. I am writing a review of the VHS edition because it is more readily available, less expensive, and the DVD's picture quality is exactly the same. I just recently watched it again and enjoyed it even more.There are only a handful of quality ghost stories on video such as THE CHANGELING, THE OTHERS, and THE UNINVITED (1944 version). They are not for everyone and never have been. I find it amusing to read reviews that criticize this film and others like it for not being scary. It all depends on what you're looking for. If you want blood and guts then go elsewhere and please, read the description of something before you watch it.The story is taken from a novel of the same name by Susan Hill. It concerns a young lawyer who becomes haunted by a vengeful spirit while trying to close out an estate. The house used in the film plus the marsh setting are as much characters as are any of the principal humans. The acting, photography, and the screenplay by Nigel Kneale (creator of QUATERMASS) are all first rate. Only the music which occasionally borrows from PSYCHO is less than stellar.As I said at the beginning, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is one of my litmus tests. Not only for ghost stories on video, but also as a somewhat arbitrary judge of character. Not liking this movie or being affected by it doesn't make you a bad person in any way but if you do like it then it means that you and I are of a similar mind and that we would get along famously.POSTSCRIPT: This film is being remade by the recently reborn Hammer Films and will star Daniel Radcliffe in his first major post-HARRY POTTER adult role.

Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[5, 5]","While there are no scenes of violence in &quot;The Woman In Black,&quot; a spooky made-for-TV British production, the intensity of the film's scarier scenes will terrify younger children. It's this very intensity that has made the film so popular with lovers of the ghost story/haunted house genre.All of the familiar trappings are here - an isolated house with a history; desolate graveyards dotted with tombstones; terrified townsfolk refusing to go near the place; an innocent outsider who must visit the home; and a silent ghost who's anything but content. &quot;The Woman In Black&quot; carries on a grand tradition of spine-tingling Victorian ghost stories dating back over 150 years. This tale could have just as easily been penned by the likes of Poe or Stoker or even Bronte.The filmmakers were very resourceful when filming the sporadic appearances of the title ghost, and when she does make an appearance, each time a tad closer to the protagonist, the viewer will definitely look over their shoulder. Unfortunately, the filmmakers/writers would have been better served to utilize this creepy appparition a bit more. &quot;The Woman In Black&quot; drags in many places, and the history behind the ghost and the town's curse is never comfortably explained.Granted, much is left to the viewer's imagination, with character reactions giving the viewer modest plot hints. But the shocking conclusion combined with several moments of difficulty in understanding the protagonist's motivation will disappoint many. The plot is simple, if not comfortable. A London lawyer is sent to a coastal town to document the possessions of recently deceased woman, finds her house is eerily isolated and plagued by mysterious sounds and, of course, a ghost dressed in black. The story set-up is quite good, though the lawyer's reaction after returning to London is puzzling at times.I would love to see this story filmed with a larger budget, as the restrictions from the TV medium are apparent throughout. Truth be told, I do plan on watching this film a second time to try and see just what I missed, as this story does require alert concentration when listening to several character monologues.When I do watch this film again, I will not be looking forward to seeing the woman in black, as she is indeed creepy - to say the least.",3,Old fashioned haunt travels familiar terrain,1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,2325,"['are', 'scenes', 'violence', 'quot', 'Woman', 'Black', 'quot', 'spooky', 'made-for-TV', 'British', 'production', 'intensity', 'film', 'scarier', 'scenes', 'will', 'terrify', 'younger', 'children', 'very', 'intensity', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'popular', 'lovers', 'ghost', 'story/haunted', 'house', 'genre.All', 'familiar', 'trappings', 'are', 'here', 'isolated', 'house', 'history', 'desolate', 'graveyards', 'dotted', 'tombstones', 'terrified', 'townsfolk', 'refusing', 'go', 'place', 'innocent', 'outsider', 'who', 'must', 'visit', 'home', 'silent', 'ghost', 'who', 'anything', 'content', 'quot', 'Woman', 'Black', 'quot', 'grand', 'tradition', 'spine-tingling', 'Victorian', 'ghost', 'stories', 'dating', 'back', '150', 'years', 'tale', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'been', 'penned', 'likes', 'Poe', 'Stoker', 'even', 'Bronte.The', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'very', 'resourceful', 'when', 'filming', 'sporadic', 'appearances', 'title', 'ghost', 'when', 'make', 'appearance', 'time', 'tad', 'closer', 'protagonist', 'viewer', 'will', 'definitely', 'look', 'over', 'shoulder', 'Unfortunately', 'filmmakers/writers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'utilize', 'creepy', 'appparition', 'bit', 'more', 'quot', 'Woman', 'Black', 'quot', 'drags', 'many', 'places', 'history', 'ghost', 'town', 'curse', 'never', 'comfortably', 'explained.Granted', 'much', 'left', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'character', 'reactions', 'giving', 'viewer', 'modest', 'plot', 'hints', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'combined', 'several', 'moments', 'difficulty', 'understanding', 'protagonist', 'motivation', 'will', 'disappoint', 'many', 'plot', 'simple', 'not', 'comfortable', 'London', 'lawyer', 'sent', 'coastal', 'town', 'document', 'possessions', 'recently', 'deceased', 'woman', 'house', 'eerily', 'isolated', 'plagued', 'mysterious', 'sounds', 'course', 'ghost', 'dressed', 'black', 'story', 'set-up', 'quite', 'good', 'lawyer', 'reaction', 'returning', 'London', 'puzzling', 'times.I', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'story', 'filmed', 'larger', 'budget', 'restrictions', 'TV', 'medium', 'are', 'apparent', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'do', 'plan', 'watching', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'try', 'see', 'just', 'what', 'missed', 'story', 'require', 'alert', 'concentration', 'when', 'listening', 'several', 'character', 'monologues.When', 'do', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'woman', 'black', 'indeed', 'creepy', 'say', 'least']",N/A

The movie starts out slow, building the characters up until you know who they are and what  their functions are inside the plot.  There is no gore, which I find an  exceptional plus.  The story kind of drags up until Arthur Kidd attends  Alice Drablow's funeral and then her house to settle her estate.At the  cemetery, he meets up with a woman dressed in black.  He mistakes her for a  mourner, but he is spooked by her presence.  Nobody wants to talk about her  or accompany him to Mrs. Drablow's house.  He winds up going there with the  caretaker, who drops him off and leaves.  Once there, he finds an old  cemeteryand the woman in black!  From there, the movie takes off.  The  plot  builds up, giving the viewer a couple of bumps and jumps.  But the  story is really about a terrible family secret that refuses to die, even  after Arthur Kidd returns to London.

Shipley ""David Shipley""","[22, 24]","I first saw this film when it was shown on UK television in 1989.Not having read the book, I watched what I thought would be an average, made for tv, ghost yarn. How pleasant,therefore, nearly fifteen years later to be able to pen my thoughts about what is one of the most chilling and effective films that the genre has ever produced.Set in the 1920s, a young solicitor - Arthur Kidd (played by Adrian Rawlins), is sent up from London to settle the estate of a recently deceased elderly woman. His destination is a small UK seaside town, just outside of which is the house of the deceased woman. His mission is less than enthusiastically received by the locals, who for the most part avoid the house in question like the plague. Set in salt marshes, the house which is called Eel Marsh House, is only accessible via a traitorous causeway at low tide. Once there, he learns of a high incidence of child mortality in the town, and starts to see the mysterious and frightening figure of a woman dressed entirely in black, of whom the locals are fearful and loathe to even discuss. Are the two connected? You bet your life they are, and when Arthur Kidd saves a young child in the market place, the hatred of this mysterious and terrible woman in black is then directed at him.From then on, beset by strange events and terrible noises from both inside and outside the house, Arthur's sanity starts to deteriorate...The film works to such terrible effect due to its simplicity. SFX are convincing but minimal. The Woman In Black only makes four appearences throughout the film, each one is increasingly scary though. I can recall few films, where a ghost has been depicted as so utterly evil and malevolent. The black shape when depicted on screen just seems to suck in the light around it and palpably emanates hatred. Anyone who has seen this year's 'The Grudge' may see some similarities in the depiction of the ghosts but 'The Woman In Black' is the more frightening. The film has a scene involving an appearence of the ghost to Arthur Kidd, which just flies off the Richter Scale for utter fear.Adrian Rawlins is superb as Kidd, portraying him as a gentle, loving family man, and mildly cocky young solicitor who becomes increasingly distressed and unstable, as the events surrounding him become ever more unpleasant and terrifying.Those of a nervous disposition or who are easily scared, are not recommended to watch this because of its high octane terror content. Equally if you are expecting a gore fest then forget it. This film is a supremely chilling experience to watch, and has THAT scene in it which will make your hair stand up on end.A friend of mine recently viewed the dvd on my recommendation and this is what he had to say about it:""Although there was only 2 scary scenes in there it's actually got in my head, you'll probably laugh but I was actually scared to go to bed last night and so I stayed online with my girl friend until 4 am. I had to wake up at 9 am today so I was exhausted getting up!Also when I went to bed I didn't dare walk across the room in darkness so I put my TV on standby and had my head under the covers cause I couldn't get her face out of my head. There was also another incident downstairs where I made myself a coffee and somebody had turned all the lights out, so I almost had a panic attack and ran to the light switch.Also I showed some of it to my sister's boyfriend and it freaked him out. I read on a review about the bed scene so I was expecting it (although I didn't expect it to be quite as it was) I dread to think what it would have done if I wasn't expecting it.Oh and a colleague at called me a big kid at work today cause she asked why I looked so tired and on edge and I told her.""I do like my footnotes on these reviews, so lets not make an exception here... For afficiendos of 'The Woman In Black' there is supposed to be a slightly longer version (101 mins I believe) which apparently shows a fifth appearence of the ghost through a window? I have not actually seen this but this version is reputed to be around on earlier vhs releases of the film.",5,A tale of dread,1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,4111,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'UK', 'television', '1989.Not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'watched', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'average', 'made', 'tv', 'ghost', 'yarn', 'How', 'pleasant', 'therefore', 'nearly', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'be', 'able', 'pen', 'thoughts', 'what', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'effective', 'films', 'genre', 'ever', 'produced.Set', '1920s', 'young', 'solicitor', 'Arthur', 'Kidd', 'played', 'Adrian', 'Rawlins', 'sent', 'up', 'London', 'settle', 'estate', 'recently', 'deceased', 'elderly', 'woman', 'destination', 'small', 'UK', 'seaside', 'town', 'just', 'house', 'deceased', 'woman', 'mission', 'less', 'enthusiastically', 'received', 'locals', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'avoid', 'house', 'question', 'plague', 'Set', 'salt', 'marshes', 'house', 'called', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'only', 'accessible', 'traitorous', 'causeway', 'low', 'tide', 'Once', 'there', 'high', 'incidence', 'child', 'mortality', 'town', 'see', 'mysterious', 'frightening', 'figure', 'woman', 'dressed', 'entirely', 'black', 'whom', 'locals', 'are', 'fearful', 'loathe', 'even', 'discuss', 'Are', 'two', 'connected', 'bet', 'life', 'are', 'when', 'Arthur', 'Kidd', 'young', 'child', 'market', 'place', 'hatred', 'mysterious', 'terrible', 'woman', 'black', 'then', 'directed', 'him.From', 'then', 'beset', 'strange', 'events', 'terrible', 'noises', 'house', 'Arthur', 'sanity', 'deteriorate', 'film', 'such', 'terrible', 'effect', 'due', 'simplicity', 'SFX', 'are', 'convincing', 'minimal', 'Woman', 'Black', 'only', 'four', 'appearences', 'film', 'one', 'increasingly', 'scary', 'can', 'recall', 'few', 'films', 'where', 'ghost', 'been', 'depicted', 'so', 'utterly', 'evil', 'malevolent', 'black', 'shape', 'when', 'depicted', 'screen', 'just', 'suck', 'light', 'palpably', 'emanates', 'hatred', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'year', ""'The"", 'Grudge', 'may', 'see', 'similarities', 'depiction', 'ghosts', ""'The"", 'Woman', 'Black', 'more', 'frightening', 'film', 'scene', 'involving', 'appearence', 'ghost', 'Arthur', 'Kidd', 'just', 'off', 'Richter', 'Scale', 'utter', 'fear.Adrian', 'Rawlins', 'superb', 'Kidd', 'portraying', 'gentle', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'mildly', 'cocky', 'young', 'solicitor', 'who', 'increasingly', 'distressed', 'unstable', 'events', 'surrounding', 'become', 'ever', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'terrifying.Those', 'nervous', 'disposition', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'scared', 'are', 'not', 'recommended', 'watch', 'high', 'octane', 'terror', 'content', 'Equally', 'are', 'expecting', 'gore', 'fest', 'then', 'forget', 'film', 'supremely', 'chilling', 'experience', 'watch', 'scene', 'will', 'make', 'hair', 'stand', 'up', 'end.A', 'friend', 'mine', 'recently', 'viewed', 'dvd', 'recommendation', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'was', 'only', '2', 'scary', 'scenes', 'actually', 'got', 'head', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'was', 'actually', 'scared', 'go', 'bed', 'last', 'night', 'so', 'stayed', 'online', 'girl', 'friend', '4', 'am', 'had', 'wake', 'up', '9', 'am', 'today', 'was', 'exhausted', 'getting', 'up', 'Also', 'when', 'went', 'bed', 'did', ""n't"", 'dare', 'walk', 'room', 'darkness', 'so', 'put', 'TV', 'standby', 'had', 'head', 'covers', 'cause', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'face', 'head', 'was', 'also', 'incident', 'where', 'made', 'coffee', 'somebody', 'had', 'turned', 'lights', 'out', 'almost', 'had', 'panic', 'attack', 'ran', 'light', 'switch.Also', 'showed', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'freaked', 'out', 'read', 'review', 'bed', 'scene', 'was', 'expecting', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'quite', 'was', 'dread', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'it.Oh', 'colleague', 'called', 'big', 'kid', 'work', 'today', 'cause', 'asked', 'why', 'looked', 'so', 'tired', 'edge', 'told', 'do', 'footnotes', 'reviews', 'so', 'not', 'make', 'exception', 'here', 'afficiendos', ""'The"", 'Woman', 'Black', 'supposed', 'be', 'slightly', 'longer', 'version', '101', 'mins', 'believe', 'apparently', 'fifth', 'appearence', 'ghost', 'window', 'have', 'not', 'actually', 'seen', 'version', 'reputed', 'be', 'around', 'earlier', 'vhs', 'releases', 'film']",N/A

If you like the type of slow and methodically paced stories from Masterpiece Theatre [where I first saw this many years ago] you will like this film. The eerie feeling one gets from the film still holds up after so many years. Great for a night viewing on one of those rainy nights. I have never read the book, so I cannot comment on its comparison. However, the film does not disappoint.A soliictor named Arthur Kidd (Adrian Rawlins) is sent by his firm to settle the estate of a recently deceased woman. What he encounters is a truth that the people of this community [Crythin] refuse to confront, and in fact ignore. They are being haunted by a very evil woman. The evil ghost is known simply as the Woman in Black (Pauline Moran) Parts of this film will have you jump right out of your seat. Although I am a bit desensitized to the film by now, it is still a haunting film.When Arthur realizes what he is up against; an evil that cannot be stopped; a town that refuses to recognize this evil; and his own sanity being tested, he decides that the best course is not to investigate further, but to get the hell out of there. Bad things occur when the Woman in Black is present. I don't wish to spoil the film for you, but I do  recommend the film highly. This is not a blood and gore film, but a ghost story that the director and writers of this genre can be proud of. I noticed that it is not available anymore. If you can, try and get this film.

Amazon shows prices of used discs from the 2000 release ranging from $90.00 to $200.00!  It is a good film but that is an awfully steep price to pay to be entertained for a couple of hours.I am not alone in my appreciation of this film. A remake is currently in post production. My recommendation to you would be to wait for the remake of the ""Woman in Black"" starring Daniel (Harry Potter) Radcilffe, Ciaran (Caesar from HBO's Rome) Hinds and Janet McTeer, who may prove to be an inspired choice for the ""Lady in Black"", and hope it lives up to the cult reputation of the original.

What this lawyer encounters might almost be as scary as having to take the bar exam again--well, maybe not that scary.At any rate, ""The Woman in Black"" has an old-fashioned or quaint flavor that not everyone will appreciate, but is sure to please the old timers, especially given the plethora of garbage that is littering today's movie theaters.  If one allows him/herself to be drawn into the story that is ""The Woman in Black"", it has its rewarding horror-filled moments.  I recall one scene in particular that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand straight up!  Indeed, at times, ""The Woman in Black"" is quite the chiller with some genuinely scary moments.  That being said, as a whole, the movie has trouble sustaining that insidiously scary quality of a great horror movie.  True, the ending provides the viewer with a good kick in the stomach that is sure to shock even seasoned horror movie fans, but ""The Woman in Black"" can legitimately be criticized as a bit rigid, boring, bland and drawn-out at times as well.  The action doesn't quite flow as well as it should.In general, I would recommend ""The Woman in Black"" as a solid but flawed ghost story, which is probably not for all tastes.  That being said, there is no denying that this movie is one of the better ghost stories ever committed to celluloid.",3,3.25 STARS: Chilling at times.,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,1525,"['Woman', 'Black', 'ghost', 'story', 'place', 'Victorian', 'Period', 'A', 'lawyer', 'spend', 'time', 'old', 'mansion', 'memory', 'serves', 'well', 'marshlands', 'England', 'What', 'lawyer', 'encounters', 'might', 'almost', 'be', 'as', 'scary', 'having', 'take', 'bar', 'exam', 'again', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'rate', 'Woman', 'Black', 'old-fashioned', 'quaint', 'flavor', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'appreciate', 'sure', 'please', 'old', 'timers', 'especially', 'given', 'plethora', 'garbage', 'littering', 'today', 'movie', 'theaters', 'one', 'be', 'drawn', 'story', 'Woman', 'Black', 'rewarding', 'horror-filled', 'moments', 'recall', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'will', 'make', 'hair', 'back', 'neck', 'stand', 'straight', 'up', 'Indeed', 'times', 'Woman', 'Black', 'quite', 'chiller', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'moments', 'being', 'said', 'whole', 'movie', 'trouble', 'sustaining', 'insidiously', 'scary', 'quality', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'True', 'ending', 'viewer', 'good', 'kick', 'stomach', 'sure', 'shock', 'even', 'seasoned', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'Woman', 'Black', 'can', 'legitimately', 'be', 'criticized', 'bit', 'rigid', 'boring', 'bland', 'drawn-out', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'action', ""n't"", 'quite', 'flow', 'as', 'well', 'general', 'would', 'recommend', 'Woman', 'Black', 'solid', 'flawed', 'ghost', 'story', 'probably', 'not', 'tastes', 'being', 'said', 'denying', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'ghost', 'stories', 'ever', 'committed', 'celluloid']",N/A

346293,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6302925525,Jeffrey Leach,"[104, 112]","A problem I am increasingly encountering when watching horror movies is that I am often completely unafraid of the images passing by onscreen. In some respects that is understandable considering most of the films I watch really are not attempting to scare the viewer. Gallons of blood and yet another knife wielding psycho has been done so many times that a body popping out of a closet or the old &quot;stalk and slash&quot; routine rarely raise a hair on my neck. Fortunately, I occasionally run across something that does rise above the mass to deliver profoundly scary thrills. Moreover, these movies, and there are not many of them, usually accomplish this feat without significant bloodshed. &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; is one of these rarities, an obscure, made for television British picture that plays like an old time ghost story replete with scary sound effects, malevolent apparitions, and a chilling back story.  This is grim stuff, and you are a lost cause if the ending doesn't make you sit up and take note. Some American cable channel really ought to start showing this one every Halloween.Young attorney Arthur Kidd is a quite likeable fellow; he is a bright young man dedicated to his job, has an attractive young wife, two lovely children, and enjoys the company of his fellow man. Unlike most of the stodgy fogies at his law firm, he will take a few minutes out of his day to talk to lowly law clerks even though his boss constantly upbraids him for such unprofessional behavior. In what feels like a punishment for Kidd's continued insubordination in this regard, the senior partner in the firm orders Arthur to go to the village of Crythin Gifford where an important client recently died. It is the young lawyer's job to secure the recently deceased's papers at a place called Eel-Marsh House, however long that takes, and report back to the home office. The entire job shouldn't take more than a week, but the assignment bothers Arthur nonetheless because it means a lengthy separation from his family. He goes, though, because he hopes to secure a rapid advance within the firm. Initially, few indications exist that this mission to a misty little village in the middle of nowhere contains a horror beyond time and space.The first indication something is very wrong with this new situation occurs when Arthur sees an ominous figure, a woman clad entirely in black, during a visit to a cemetery in the village. Seeing a person standing around in mourning attire in a burial ground certainly shouldn't raise too many red flags, but there is something about this woman that gives Kidd a bad feeling. Further signs of trouble arise when the attorney encounters several locals, including one of the village elders, who express reservations about Arthur's mission in town. It seems that nearly everyone avoids the Eel-Marsh house on the outskirts of the town, but good old Kidd knows that is exactly where he must go to do his job. He secures transportation to the house, learns the floor plan and how to turn on the lights, and sets about his work. Eerie events happen almost immediately upon his arrival. Kidd hears the most horrible screams and sounds of a buggy splashing into the water out on the road heading to the house, and he even sees that enigmatic woman in black again on the grounds. A room within the house, unreachable because of a door impervious to all attempts to gain entry, provides further creepy situations. As Arthur slowly unearths the terrors of the abandoned estate, he learns more than any human should about the paranormal and its potentialities in the world of the living. The last twenty minutes or so of &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; slap you in the face with shock after shock, and just when you think it is finally over the last nightmare unfolds with devastating effectiveness.There really isn't any way to prepare yourself for this film. My girlfriend, who walked in about twenty minutes into the film and watched it to the end, claimed that it wasn't all that scary. But I hold a different view, especially concerning a scene where Arthur lies in bed recovering from his stay at the house and finally sees the woman in black up close and personal followed by the last minute of the movie. I can still see that quiet little lake and what Arthur sees standing some distance from the boat containing himself and his wife. If the woman in black and all of her attendant menace do little for you, there is still the oppressive atmosphere that hangs heavy over nearly every scene in the film. The Eel-House is your typical mist shrouded house on the coast: dank, dark, and burdened with horrible secrets. I consider myself a brave, do anything type of person, but there is no way I would spend any time in that house alone. It is simply too creepy for words.The only significant failing of this film is its noticeable television feel. Some of the production values don't come off as well as they could and the editing founders in a few places, but these are minor problems considering the picture as a whole. It is light years better than most of the pap passed off as entertainment these days. Regrettably, the transfer quality on the DVD is mediocre, with its often jiggling and color soft picture. Despite these small difficulties, &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; succeeds in presenting the viewer with a classic ghost story that is frequently the equivalent of pouring a bucket of icy water on your head.",5,Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!,1070064000,"11 29, 2003",2003,5461,"['problem', 'am', 'increasingly', 'encountering', 'when', 'watching', 'horror', 'movies', 'am', 'often', 'completely', 'unafraid',

It is based on the novel by Susan Hill.  Nigel Kneale wrote the script.  The musical score by Rachel Portman is pretty creepy.  The so-called ""woman in black"" reminds me of the ghost of Miss Jessel from the 1961 ghost story movie The Innocents, based on Henry James's novel The Turn Of The Screw, starring Deborah Kerr, Pamela Franklin, and Martin Stephens.  The Innocents is a superior movie to The Woman In Black, but The Woman In Black is a very solid movie nonetheless.  The atmosphere, the music, and the ghost combine to creep out the viewer like only the elite ghost story movies can.  Think of movies like The Innocents (1961), The Haunting (1963), The Changeling (1980), The Legend Of Hell House (1973), The Shining (1980), Rose Red (2002), etc.I discovered that this horror movie is being REMADE, due to be released in February 2012.  So what else is new?I recommend The Woman In Black.  It's unavailable on DVD, but as another reviewer pointed out, it probably will be available at the time that the remake is released on DVD.  It's so predictable.  So, you'll have a choice - watch the original, or watch the remake.

346304,AST7UNIXVOAVA,6302925525,Mark Shanks,"[4, 18]","The screenplay for this production was written by Nigel Kneale, of ""Quatermass"" fame, and in some ways is a reworking of his own ""ghost story"", ""The Stone Tape"", although it is somewhat-loosely based on a novelette by Susan Hill. Oddly, Kneale even decided to change the name of the protagonist, who in the story was named ""Arthur Kipps"", in an homage to the H.G. Wells semi-autobiographical novel ""Kipps"". Here, he becomes the scaredy-cat cypher Arthur KIDD. I stand second to none in my admiration of Kneale's work, as a survey of my reviews would show. And I am definitely a fan of the British classic ghost story, especially those of M.R. James, and still believe that the most effective scares are those that are suggested, rather than the bucket-of-blood variety.That said - this was a seriously disappointing film. The back story suffers immeasurably for its under-development - there simply is no basis for the ""evil"" or ""curse"" of the haunting figure. A pivotal scene is not even depicted, and subsequently glossed over. The behavior of the protagonist *starts* at the rankest cowardice, and descends not so much into madness as idiocy. And the ending.....well, I could only shake my head. What we have isn't so much a solid, coherent story as a series of eerie vignettes, loosely strung together. SO loosely that the overall impact is lost after the few and far-between ""BOO!"" scares tossed out. (In fact, the biggest ""scare"" in the film is a watered down rif on a scene from the Vincent Price ""House on Haunted Hill"", if you can believe it.) This doesn't provide any competition at all to serious classics such as the Robert Wise version of ""The Haunting"", or any of the Val Lewton pictures.The DVD itself is also disappointing. Colors are muted, and the picture  is fuzzy, but I suppose the fact that it was intended only as a made-for-British-television production could be the reason.

Forced to go out by himself he learns the real reason that nobody wants to go out there.

That gives you an idea of the impact this DVD has on anyone who has ever seen it. It begins and proceeds quietly, it contains no gore, it would bore the life out of people whose idea of a great horror film is ""Hostel"" or ""Saw."" Yet for those viewers who appreciate films such as ""The Innocents"" or the original ""Haunting,"" ""The Woman in Black"" is an obvious and unforgettable classic. The film's quietly foreboding atmosphere seeps into your bones and your brain, leading to a scene about three-quarters of the way through that contains more genuine terror in its sixty-second duration than all the multiple hours of the ""Saw"" movies combined. And that scene, in turn, prepares you for the devastating, take-no-prisoners ending. It is a tragedy that this DVD is now virtually unavailable anywhere; according to Susan Hill, the author of the original novel, Universal has bought the rights to ""The Woman in Black,"" and for whatever reason refuses either to re-release it on DVD or allow it to be broadcast.

The spinetingling reviews, the movie's premise, and that it belonged to the reliable English Victorian horror genre. The fact that it was out of print, with even bootlegged versions selling for around 80-100 US Dollars convinced me that it was a sure bet, and I bought it. Having acquired it, and having elevated it to the very top of my movie collection, I decided to save it for the perfect watching occassion, savoring the anticipation. That perfect night was yesterday, a cold, windy night.&#60;SPOILER ALERT&#62;Watching it, my reverence quickly changed to feeling let down. I couldn't believe that I was being told so early into the movie, that the woman in black was a ghost (by her various and sudden appearances and disappearances). Once that was established, the course of the movie was pretty well charted and guessable. A couple more visions, objects being  displaced without human intervention, mist and fog, etc. In other words, the usual ghost story formula.Not once did I find myself scared, or even creeped out. It was just an old show that did not even seem to try or want to be different. I simply could not fathom how the woman in black was supposed to be scary. Because she had a sallow complexion and staring eyes? And you actually get to see her close up just twice in the entire movie, for about 10 seconds in all! Every other time, she's just a silhoutte figure standing way off in the distance.The ending was  not completely unexpected, but certainly a change from the rest of the formula. Despite that, it couldn't redeem the rest of the movie.&#60;/SPOILER ALERT&#62;Let me assure you that I am not a perpetual cynic/skeptic. I do find certain movies creepy. Movies where imagery is used to rake the viewer's imagination and make them dredge up their own worst fears, rather than spell out in certain terms what it is you are supposed to be scared of. The 2 movies that made an impact on me were the Blair Witch Project and The Ring.So if you share the same likes, I would recommend that you don't spend your hard earned money on this vastly over-rated movie, unless you can find it for under $20. It is a fine movie to watch in the BBC &#34;Mystery&#34; series vein. That's about as scary as it got for me. It has fallen off its pedestal, and will never occupy the place I had reserved for it.

Here, in this cult little offering, if you see the ""Woman in Black"" then a child will die, or so goes the tale in the small British seaside village of Crythin were young London solicitor Arthur Kidd has been sent by his peer to tidy up the loose ends after a client who owned the revered Eel Marsh House estate passed away.The town itself has a secret that slowly unravels as Kidd finds himself trying to get his work done so that he can return home to his wife and family. In the town he begins to hear stories and learn things about the house he is about visit. The house itself is situated on a small island that can only be reached by a seaside path called the ""Nine lives"" path, because that is how many lives you will need to cross it, as the tide comes quickly in and out covering the path and cutting the house off from the rest of the mainland. As Kidd takes his inventory of the house he starts to find obscure artifacts and hears ghastly sounds that slowly peel away at his confidence. Back in the town he learns more about this strange woman that he sees dressed in black popping up around the place, but the locals want nothing to do with her. In fact most of them go out of their way to avoid her completely. Kidd decides to grab the bull by the horns and spend a night in the house to see if he can unravel the mystery.This film is wonderfully cryptic and captures the spirit of Poe and the feel of Hitchcock all mixed together in a total threatening atmosphere of mortal dread. Do you see the cover of this DVD and that woman pictured on it? Well she will have your wits on hairs-end before the final credits role. There are several scenes where she appears and each of them is hellraising stuff, literally. Just by standing there she will have you taken aback and when she starts moving, well that is a whole different sport altogether. The filmmakers have managed to actually create great scary scenes in the same vein as ""The Changeling"" or ""Salem's Lot"".Horror fans tout this as the scariest film of all time. Is it the scariest film of all time? Well it is certainly not the best looking horror film of all time because of its restrictive television look and feel, however some of the scenes in this screamer are outstandingly well done and it transcends what you would expect from such a production. This is not a horror, but more of a ghost story, yet there are psychologically horrific scenes. One involves a toy soldier and little girls voice and then... well once you see that scene alone you will be hard pressed to find anything that will make you jump as much. Truth be told there are many scenes in other films that you will make you jump (Sloth in Se7en comes to mind) but it ranks up there with the best of them. However where this film does work, and it does this in aces, is with the appearance of the Woman in Black just standing there, doing nothing, just staring with those dark eyes - the blackest eyes - the devils eyes... that is why this film gets the #1 spot hands down.

A really scary ghost with awful eyes (they'll haunt you) a hidden secret and very bad energy haunts an English village killing off its children and making life especially terrible for a reclusive elderly lady who lives alone in a house that literally almost disappears into the sea come high tide.  Enter a truly likeable family man with beautiful kids and a loving wife to tie things up after the death of the lady and things go horribly wrong.Like THE HAUNTING, sound effects make for a tremendous part of the spooky goings-on, allowing one's imagination to make up for what's not explicitly visible.  Save for one top-notch all-stops-pulled-out scene that literally blows you out of your seat.  (Great fun.)  The ""jump"" factor is here in spades.  I kept anticipating something awful was about to happen the whole film through. This made for an honestly unsettling experience.  And awful things do happen, too.  The ending, for lack of superlatives, is exceptional.  Devastating but not entirely unexpected.It's easy to understand how this developed into the cult classic that it has.  I was struck by the quality of this production, (especially the extreme historical accuracy and detail -- which I am a meanie old stickler for) if not so much the quality of the VHS.  Though the VHS, I've been told, is far better than the DVD version, done at the wrong speed making for problems with the audio.  But the lack of tape quality, that bit of fuzziness around the edges, adds to the edginess of the entire viewing experience.

346317,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6302925525,Reviewer,"[7, 36]","Any student of the cinema will tell you that the medium of film is an art form, and that which is produced within it is therefore open to opinions that are inherently subjective.  That said, let's take a look at this film, which is touted as being a ""spine-chilling ghost story.""  Warning!  Danger, Will Robinson!  Don't call the orthopedic surgeon just yet, because ""The Woman In Black,"" directed by Herbert Wise, is decidedly NOT chilling, nor is it apt to affect your spine in any way, shape or form.  Those with insomnia, however, may want to give it a go, because if this one doesn't put you to sleep nothing will, and you had better seek professional help posthaste.Solicitor Arthur Kidd (Adrian Rawlins) is dispatched from London to the coastal town of Crythin to attend the funeral and settle the estate of one of his firms clients, just deceased.  At the cemetery, he first sees the woman in black (Pauline Moran), whom he assumes is a mourner.  And upon his arrival at the mansion of the departed client, which is situated in a rather remote and nearly inaccessible location near the sea, he sees her again, in the yard.  Later, after conducting his inventory of household items, he is visited by another, rather unseemly apparition; and still later, as he ventures out upon the road to await the carriage that will take him back to town, he is subjected to a cacophony of unearthly wails and sounds of unseen people in torment.  And it's all a part of the mystery surrounding the enigmatic individual of the title.From the beginning, though, the ""mystery,"" such as it is, holds little promise of any supernatural excitement or thrills.  The story/screenplay (by Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale) is insipid and uninspired, and director Wise does little to make it otherwise.  The tale begs for an atmosphere of delicious foreboding, but it never happens; Wise's idea of ""atmosphere"" is providing gray skies and fog.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, except that a good fog should induce some apprehension, and Wise's does not; it just kind of lays about, producing nothing more than a lack of visibility.  And he doesn't exactly go ""out of the box"" for effective F/X; the best he can come up with is borrowing the famous ""Skree! Skree! Skree!"" sound that Hitchcock used so effectively in ""Psycho,"" which here, during one of the ""apparitions,"" does nothing but startle the viewer into agitation as it grates on the ears.  In the final analysis, to say this film is less than riveting would be a gross understatement; there is simply nothing here to make you sit up and take notice.  Add to all of this a lame ending, at which point the filmmakers at last make an attempt to draw the viewer in and make an emotional connection-- which is too little and comes too late-- and what you have is a disappointing and forgettable film, to say the least.The performances, too, are every bit as uninspired as the presentation of the film itself.  Beginning with Rawlins, the portrayals are all to the last actor-- while neither convincing nor unconvincing-- just...well...dull.  This is in large part, of course, a reflection upon the story and the director; the players did do the best they could with what they were given to work with.  What this film needs more than anything is some nuance, some spark! of life--  but where there is no flint, there is no fire.  Unfortunately, the barbecue will have to wait for another time and another picture.The supporting cast includes Bernard Hepton (Sam Toovey), David Daker (Josiah), Clare Holman (Stella Kidd), Fiona Walker (Mrs. Toovey), Joseph Upton (Eddie), Robin Weaver (Bessie), William Simons (Keckwick) and John Franklyn-Robbins (Reverend Greet).  Without question, employing subtlety can be extremely effective in presenting a story with supernatural underpinnings; the director, however, must be astute in the dispensing of it, lest he reduce his audience to a state of catalepsy, which is essentially what Wise has done with ""The Woman In Black.""  But to those who have somehow unluckily found their way to this cinematic casualty, take heart; because the movie you were actually looking for is out there and readily available to treat you to a ""real"" spine-chilling ghost story.  It's called ""The Others,"" and stars Nicole Kidman.

One of the firm's clients - a lonely widow - has finally died, leaving Arthur Kidd to settle all her matters, sell the house and face the unsympathetic spectre who haunts the woman's house.  Nobody in the drab town believes in ghosts, but they fear them just the same.  The ghost appears as a funereal-garbed woman and times her arrival to coincide with some catastrophe that maims and kills children.  The story tosses in a haunted house - the one that must be sold - accessible only by a path frequently submerged by tides.  Can Kidd learn the secret of the Woman in Black?  And what fateful consequences does she bode for him?This was a slim story.  Trying to avoid spoilers, but the main problem is that apart from several critical scenes, nothing much happens here.  The plot works in the ghost's earthly origins as its backstory, but the result never connects with the actions of the ghost as observed by the hero.  Too much of what the ghost does is simply arbitrary - it's 1st seen by Kidd at a funeral well away from the grim house, and then it follows him once he's been there and back.  The ghost apparently chooses its victims, but there's little evidence in its preferences.  Neither is the story all that scary.  There is one exceptional scene which is maddening in its ability to generate tension, but it's not just the scariest scene, but one of the few that rises above simply chilling.  Worse, it's soon followed by another scary scene which seems to borderline on cheesy.""Black"" is a handsome production - if you watched a lot of ""Mystery"" on PBS during the `80's, then it's probably familiar ground, with Harriet Vane and Lord Peter Whimsey looking to appear around the next corner.  You watch it and begin to wonder if perhaps a tad too much attention was paid to getting cars and clothes right, and not enough making the story seem all that cogent.  We caught this flick a week after we caught ""The Stone Tape"" (and got scared out of our pants in the process), and while ""Black"" looks more expensive, ""Tape"" remains the clearly superior chill-fest of the 2.",2,Disappointing,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,2382,"['Rooten', 'Review', 'were', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'Kneale', 'adaptation', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'book', 'letdown', 'was', 'almost', 'painful.What', 'young', 'British', 'attorney', 'guess', 'solicitor', 'strong-armed', 'much', 'older', 'meaner', 'boss', 'tidying', 'up', 'estate', 'matter', 'One', 'firm', 'clients', 'lonely', 'widow', 'finally', 'died', 'leaving', 'Arthur', 'Kidd', 'settle', 'matters', 'sell', 'house', 'face', 'unsympathetic', 'spectre', 'who', 'woman', 'house', 'Nobody', 'drab', 'town', 'ghosts', 'fear', 'just', 'same', 'ghost', 'funereal-garbed', 'woman', 'times', 'arrival', 'coincide', 'catastrophe', 'maims', 'kills', 'children', 'story', 'haunted', 'house', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'sold', 'accessible', 'only', 'path', 'frequently', 'submerged', 'tides', 'Can', 'Kidd', 'learn', 'secret', 'Woman', 'Black', 'what', 'fateful', 'consequences', 'bode', 'was', 'slim', 'story', 'Trying', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'main', 'problem', 'apart', 'several', 'critical', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'much', 'here', 'plot', 'ghost', 'earthly', 'origins', 'backstory', 'result', 'never', 'actions', 'ghost', 'observed', 'hero', 'Too', 'much', 'what', 'ghost', 'simply', 'arbitrary', '1st', 'seen', 'Kidd', 'funeral', 'well', 'away', 'grim', 'house', 'then', 'once', 'been', 'back', 'ghost', 'apparently', 'victims', 'little', 'evidence', 'preferences', 'story', 'scary', 'one', 'exceptional', 'scene', 'maddening', 'ability', 'generate', 'tension', 'not', 'just', 'scariest', 'scene', 'one', 'few', 'simply', 'chilling', 'Worse', 'soon', 'followed', 'scary', 'scene', 'borderline', 'cheesy', 'Black', 'handsome', 'production', 'watched', 'lot', 'Mystery', 'PBS', '80', 'then', 'probably', 'familiar', 'ground', 'Harriet', 'Vane', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Whimsey', 'looking', 'appear', 'next', 'corner', 'watch', 'begin', 'wonder', 'perhaps', 'tad', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'getting', 'cars', 'clothes', 'right', 'not', 'enough', 'making', 'story', 'seem', 'cogent', 'caught', 'flick', 'week', 'caught', 'Stone', 'Tape', 'got', 'scared', 'pants', 'process', 'Black', 'more', 'expensive', 'Tape', 'clearly', 'superior', 'chill-fest', '2']",N/A

When he arrives in the small town of Crythin, he finds that few of the townspeople will have anything to do with him or his work, and keeps seeing a mysterious woman in black. Eventually he begins to investigate the strange history of the town and becomes ensnared in its horror. A genuinely frightening tale with lots of creepy scares. You do have to use your imagination in the film, but believe me it's worth the effort. I love ghost stories like The Ring, The Others, The Innocents, The Haunting, and The Changeling, so I knew I couldn't pass this up. This is definately a thinking man's movie. One of the scariest flicks you'll ever see. If you're the type of horror movie buff who likes that creepy type of atmosphere where your imagination can jut run wild without a whole lot of fake blood and gore then this movie is for you. Okay I'll admit I love blood and guts movies as well, but I have a soft spot for psycholical horror flicks such as this and The Blair Witch as well.
