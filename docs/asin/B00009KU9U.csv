753856,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00009KU9U,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","I hate to say so, but I'm pretty disappointed by this stinker of a movie. Excited as I was to see the presumably last film of part-time action heroine Shannon Lee, it wasn't long into this one's 85-minute runtime that I was not only let down but virtually insulted by the weak & weird story, the poor production values, the uneven acting, the scarce action, and the slanting by the DVD cover in suggesting that Shannon is the main character. This one's bad, but not even bad enough to be good.The story: small-time drug dealer Gavin Matthews (Robert Vitelli,Hot Springs Hotel) is forcibly recruited by a mysterious ""Corporation"" to become a lethal agent. Leary of their claims to further justice, Gavin comes to suspect a darker purpose, the uncovering of which he will face alongside his sexy new educator (Lee,Enter the Eagles).To clarify, Shannon Lee does in fact earn her supporting credit, especially in the last third of the film when she essentially becomes the co-protagonist. However, it's not merely her lack of screen-time which irks me, but how sorry of a lead star Robert Vitelli makes. Admittedly, most of my ire lies with the stupid things the script has him do, but I nevertheless grew to dislike the guy while watching his movie: uncharismatic to a fault, his character nevertheless hogs the spotlight by spending most of the movie being inattentive, snarky, and embarrassingly weak during umpteen training montages. Neither cool nor funny, I found myself wishing that Shannon or even co-star Michael Dorn (Star Trek: The Next Generation) would take over as the lead, but the movie futilely keeps trying to turn him into an action hero.Speaking of action, it's simultaneously the best and worst part of the movie. The second half of the film is much more generous in this subject than the first, but what's there is hit-or-miss. The gunfights are forgettable, save for a silly instance wherein Gavin shoots a bunch of folks while spinning around in a swiveling chair. A surprising number of hand-to-hand brawls are crammed into the final thirty-five minutes, including about four for Lee. Shannon's not necessarily the onscreen equal of her late father or brother, but it's still nice to see her throwing kicks. By comparison, poor Gavin doesn't come close, as he performs the most ridiculously elaborate kung fu hand motions you've ever seen outside of a parody. Though the brawls are co-wrangled by one of my favorite choreographers, Koichi Sakamoto (Drive), they're far from his best work and are routinely mucked about with annoying slow motion.This is undeniably a very cheap film with a very small scope. Almost every setting within the Company complex looks like a set, and I suspect that the filmmakers merely built different walls for different rooms on the same stage - too many locations have the same tiled floor. Additionally, the storyline tries to throw too many curveballs at you: the nature of the Company and how Gavin was recruited are both called into question ad naueseum, and the final twist regarding the whole purpose of the setup is far too ambitious to be taken seriously. Add to this the weirdo soundtrack and you've got a movie that's far from likeable. People who absolutely want to see Shannon Lee in some fight scenes and who've seen her prior movies might still want to pick it up, but that's where the appeal ends.",2,"""To truly own something, you must be willing to destroy it""",1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,3364,"['hate', 'say', 'so', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'stinker', 'movie', 'Excited', 'was', 'see', 'presumably', 'last', 'film', 'part-time', 'action', 'heroine', 'Shannon', 'Lee', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'one', '85-minute', 'runtime', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'let', 'down', 'virtually', 'insulted', 'weak', 'weird', 'story', 'poor', 'production', 'values', 'uneven', 'acting', 'scarce', 'action', 'slanting', 'DVD', 'cover', 'suggesting', 'Shannon', 'main', 'character', 'one', 'bad', 'not', 'even', 'bad', 'enough', 'be', 'good.The', 'story', 'small-time', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Gavin', 'Matthews', 'Robert', 'Vitelli', 'Hot', 'Springs', 'Hotel', 'forcibly', 'recruited', 'mysterious', 'Corporation', 'become', 'lethal', 'agent', 'Leary', 'claims', 'further', 'justice', 'Gavin', 'suspect', 'darker', 'purpose', 'uncovering', 'will', 'face', 'alongside', 'sexy', 'new', 'educator', 'Lee', 'Enter', 'Eagles', '.To', 'clarify', 'Shannon', 'Lee', 'fact', 'earn', 'supporting', 'credit', 'especially', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'when', 'essentially', 'co-protagonist', 'However', 'not', 'merely', 'lack', 'screen-time', 'how', 'sorry', 'lead', 'star', 'Robert', 'Vitelli', 'Admittedly', 'most', 'ire', 'stupid', 'things', 'script', 'do', 'nevertheless', 'grew', 'dislike', 'guy', 'watching', 'movie', 'uncharismatic', 'fault', 'character', 'nevertheless', 'hogs', 'spotlight', 'spending', 'most', 'movie', 'being', 'inattentive', 'snarky', 'embarrassingly', 'weak', 'umpteen', 'training', 'montages', 'cool', 'funny', 'found', 'wishing', 'Shannon', 'even', 'co-star', 'Michael', 'Dorn', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'would', 'take', 'over', 'lead', 'movie', 'futilely', 'trying', 'turn', 'action', 'hero.Speaking', 'action', 'simultaneously', 'best', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'generous', 'subject', 'first', 'what', 'hit-or-miss', 'gunfights', 'are', 'forgettable', 'save', 'silly', 'instance', 'wherein', 'Gavin', 'bunch', 'folks', 'spinning', 'around', 'swiveling', 'chair', 'surprising', 'number', 'hand-to-hand', 'brawls', 'are', 'crammed', 'final', 'thirty-five', 'minutes', 'including', 'four', 'Lee', 'Shannon', 'not', 'necessarily', 'onscreen', 'equal', 'late', 'father', 'brother', 'still', 'nice', 'see', 'throwing', 'kicks', 'comparison', 'poor', 'Gavin', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'most', 'ridiculously', 'elaborate', 'kung', 'fu', 'hand', 'motions', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'parody', 'brawls', 'are', 'co-wrangled', 'one', 'favorite', 'choreographers', 'Koichi', 'Sakamoto', 'Drive', ""'re"", 'far', 'best', 'work', 'are', 'routinely', 'mucked', 'annoying', 'slow', 'motion.This', 'undeniably', 'very', 'cheap', 'film', 'very', 'small', 'scope', 'setting', 'Company', 'complex', 'looks', 'set', 'suspect', 'filmmakers', 'merely', 'built', 'different', 'walls', 'different', 'rooms', 'same', 'stage', 'too', 'many', 'locations', 'have', 'same', 'tiled', 'floor', 'Additionally', 'storyline', 'throw', 'too', 'many', 'curveballs', 'nature', 'Company', 'how', 'Gavin', 'was', 'recruited', 'are', 'called', 'question', 'ad', 'naueseum', 'final', 'twist', 'regarding', 'whole', 'purpose', 'setup', 'far', 'too', 'ambitious', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Add', 'weirdo', 'soundtrack', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'far', 'likeable', 'People', 'who', 'absolutely', 'want', 'see', 'Shannon', 'Lee', 'fight', 'scenes', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'prior', 'movies', 'might', 'still', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'appeal']",N/A

She does a great job all around and the potential she possesses is instantly noticeable. It's a shame she is not offered more mainstream roles.The only downside to this film is when Shannon is not in a particular scene and that definitely means a lot. She saves this movie from being a complete failure.Overall I highly recommend this picture, although it's not a masterpiece (far from it) it's a stepping stone for Shannon to expand her career and move onto bigger and better things.",4,Shannon Lee Shines,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,559,"['movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'sole', 'reason', 'Shannon', 'Lee', 'great', 'job', 'around', 'potential', 'instantly', 'noticeable', 'shame', 'not', 'offered', 'more', 'mainstream', 'roles.The', 'only', 'downside', 'film', 'when', 'Shannon', 'not', 'particular', 'scene', 'definitely', 'lot', 'movie', 'being', 'complete', 'failure.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'picture', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'far', 'stepping', 'stone', 'Shannon', 'expand', 'career', 'move', 'bigger', 'better', 'things']",N/A

Well, it takes up at least the first 2/3rds of this one.  Yes, that is as boring as it sounds.  There's a reason that so many movies compress the training sequence.  In this film, you'll feel like you've seen it in real time.There's some half-decent action in the last 15 minutes, but mostly the ""clever twists"" aren't clever, and the plot is boring/predictable.  If you'd compressed the whole film into 15 minutes and then moved on to the exciting stuff, that might have been fun.  There's not even enough gratuitous nudity to make it worthwhile.There's also not enough Shannon Lee, who really is a likable presence.  I'd like to see her in a better action flick with a good fight choreographer.  Don't let the presence of Michael Dorn (Star Trek TNG) fool you into thinking this might be good.  It's not, and he's not, either.  I almost felt sorry for him and the other Trek actor, whose name slips my mind.  Did I mention that the main character is an unlikable jerk?  Shannon gets this an extra star, but this is only for hardcore Lee fanatics.
