384714,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,6303679021,Duane Thomas,"[5, 7]","I never fail to be astounded this movie is nearly unknown. Cold Blooded is the most inventive, thoroughly enjoyable black comedy I've ever seen. It's a crime it's not available on DVD.I first became aware of Cold Blooded when a friend told me, ""You've got to see this movie. I've shown it to four people so far and they've all loved it."" Since then, I've also introduced four people to Cold Blooded - and they've all loved it.Cold Blooded stars Jason Priestley as Cosmo. (One hilarious thing about this movie is that, with only two exceptions, none of the characters has a last name.) Cosmo is, well, dumb. I'm not saying he's a moron, that's overstating matters, but he's definitely operating with a subnormal IQ. The only thing he's good at, almost an idiot savant, he's really great with numbers. Thus he makes his living as a bookie for a local mobster. Then Cosmo's boss is wiped out by his second-in-command, Gordon (Robert Loggia, wonderful as always) who decides, for some ungodly reason, Cosmo should get a ""promotion"" from bookie to hitman. This of course makes no sense, but it's the hook that gives us the rest of the movie so we'll let it pass.Cosmo is put under the tutelage of an experienced hitman, Steve (Peter Riegert, probably best known as Otter, the guy in Animal House having a very conflicted relationship with Karen Black). Riegert was the perfect choice to play Steve, projecting world weary cynicism, a desert dry sense of humor, and a surprising level of real liking for his new pupil. Riegert's drollery and comedic timing in this role is beyond reproach. For my money the funniest moment in the film is Steve's line as he's teaching Cosmo gun safety on the firing range: ""Remember, guns don't kill people. WE kill people.""It's amazing that in this film we see Cosmo kill again and again, even people who are, to all appearances, totally decent, and we never lose sympathy for Cosmo. Jason Priestley, in my humble opinion, is seriously underrated as an actor; he imbues Cosmo with an underlying sweetness that shines through no matter what he does. It's eerie. Cosmo is a sweet, likable multiple murderer. And if you thinks that's easy....try it some time.I would be remiss did I not mention that Michael J. Fox (who also co-produced) has a wonderful though, um, brief role as Gordon's accountant, Tim Alexander. Apparently when you're co-producer your character gets more than one name. By extension, Tim's wife Jean also has two names.Janeane Garofalo as Honey, Cosmo's current long-term hooker, has the second best line in Cold Blooded:Cosmo: But I thought we had something kind of special. Like you were my girlfriend.Honey: Cosmo, I like you. Of all the people that pay to have sex with me, I like you the best.Steve begins teaching Cosmo the ropes, including taking him on his first hits. And Cosmo is great at it, a total natural. He's so dumb he doesn't panic when things go wrong. He has just enough mentality to feel kind of bad about the people he kills, so he starts taking yoga classes to deal with the stress. And it's there he meets yoga instructor Jasmine (Kimberly Williams), an almost elfin beauty.Cosmo's greatest sorrow is that he's never been in love. He's never had sex with anyone other than hookers like Honey, never even been on a real date. And he wants to be in love, to have an actual girlfriend. Jasmine might be The One. Just a few teeny-tiny obstacles in the path of true love: (a) Cosmo senses his job might be a problem, i.e. if he tries to quit, his employer will kill him - and besides, would Jasmine understand? (b) Jasmine already has a boyfriend, Randy (Josh Charles), a real jerk who doesn't treat her right. How Cosmo deals with Randy is one of the highlights of the film.Will Cosmo be able to extricate himself from his job as a hitman? Will he and Jasmine get together? Will Cosmo ever know true love? Watch Cold Blooded and find out. And be prepared to start telling friends, ""Hey, you've GOT to see this movie....""",5,An Absolutely Brilliant Black Comedy,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,3986,"['never', 'fail', 'be', 'astounded', 'movie', 'nearly', 'unknown', 'Cold', 'Blooded', 'most', 'inventive', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'black', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'crime', 'not', 'available', 'DVD.I', 'first', 'became', 'aware', 'Cold', 'Blooded', 'when', 'friend', 'told', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'four', 'people', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'then', ""'ve"", 'also', 'introduced', 'four', 'people', 'Cold', 'Blooded', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'it.Cold', 'Blooded', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'Cosmo', 'One', 'hilarious', 'thing', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'exceptions', 'none', 'characters', 'last', 'name', 'Cosmo', 'well', 'dumb', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'moron', 'overstating', 'matters', 'definitely', 'operating', 'subnormal', 'IQ', 'only', 'thing', 'good', 'almost', 'idiot', 'savant', 'really', 'great', 'numbers', 'Thus', 'living', 'bookie', 'local', 'mobster', 'Then', 'Cosmo', 'boss', 'wiped', 'out', 'second-in-command', 'Gordon', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'wonderful', 'always', 'who', 'ungodly', 'reason', 'Cosmo', 'should', 'get', 'promotion', 'bookie', 'hitman', 'course', 'sense', 'hook', 'rest', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'let', 'pass.Cosmo', 'put', 'tutelage', 'experienced', 'hitman', 'Steve', 'Peter', 'Riegert', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'Otter', 'guy', 'Animal', 'House', 'having', 'very', 'conflicted', 'relationship', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Riegert', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'Steve', 'projecting', 'world', 'weary', 'cynicism', 'desert', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'surprising', 'level', 'real', 'liking', 'new', 'pupil', 'Riegert', 'drollery', 'comedic', 'timing', 'role', 'reproach', 'money', 'funniest', 'moment', 'film', 'Steve', 'line', 'teaching', 'Cosmo', 'gun', 'safety', 'firing', 'range', 'Remember', 'guns', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'people', 'WE', 'kill', 'people', 'amazing', 'film', 'see', 'Cosmo', 'kill', 'again', 'again', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'appearances', 'totally', 'decent', 'never', 'lose', 'sympathy', 'Cosmo', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'humble', 'opinion', 'seriously', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Cosmo', 'underlying', 'sweetness', 'matter', 'what', 'eerie', 'Cosmo', 'sweet', 'likable', 'multiple', 'murderer', 'thinks', 'easy', '.try', 'time.I', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'who', 'also', 'co-produced', 'wonderful', 'though', 'um', 'brief', 'role', 'Gordon', 'accountant', 'Tim', 'Alexander', 'Apparently', 'when', ""'re"", 'co-producer', 'character', 'more', 'one', 'name', 'extension', 'Tim', 'wife', 'Jean', 'also', 'two', 'names.Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'Honey', 'Cosmo', 'current', 'long-term', 'hooker', 'second', 'best', 'line', 'Cold', 'Blooded', 'Cosmo', 'thought', 'had', 'something', 'kind', 'special', 'were', 'girlfriend.Honey', 'Cosmo', 'like', 'people', 'pay', 'have', 'sex', 'like', 'best.Steve', 'teaching', 'Cosmo', 'ropes', 'including', 'taking', 'first', 'hits', 'Cosmo', 'great', 'total', 'natural', 'so', 'dumb', ""n't"", 'panic', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'just', 'enough', 'mentality', 'feel', 'kind', 'bad', 'people', 'taking', 'yoga', 'classes', 'deal', 'stress', 'there', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'Jasmine', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'almost', 'elfin', 'beauty.Cosmo', 'greatest', 'sorrow', 'never', 'been', 'love', 'never', 'had', 'sex', 'anyone', 'other', 'hookers', 'Honey', 'never', 'even', 'been', 'real', 'date', 'be', 'love', 'have', 'actual', 'girlfriend', 'Jasmine', 'might', 'be', 'One', 'few', 'teeny-tiny', 'obstacles', 'path', 'true', 'love', 'Cosmo', 'job', 'might', 'be', 'problem', 'i.e', 'quit', 'employer', 'will', 'kill', 'besides', 'would', 'Jasmine', 'understand', 'b', 'Jasmine', 'already', 'boyfriend', 'Randy', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'real', 'jerk', 'who', ""n't"", 'treat', 'right', 'How', 'Cosmo', 'deals', 'Randy', 'one', 'highlights', 'film.Will', 'Cosmo', 'be', 'able', 'extricate', 'job', 'hitman', 'Will', 'Jasmine', 'get', 'together', 'Will', 'Cosmo', 'ever', 'know', 'true', 'love', 'Watch', 'Cold', 'Blooded', 'find', 'out', 'be', 'prepared', 'start', 'telling', 'friends', 'Hey', ""'ve"", 'GOT', 'see', 'movie']","Cold Blooded aka ""Coldblooded""  VHS"
384715,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6303679021,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[0, 0]","This is a surprisingly good--and totally unknown--film.  It's a black comedy about an emotionless guy, Cosmo (Jason Priestley, who does a terrific job) who takes on the role of hitman for the mob.  The local mob boss is played by Robert Loggia with the first name Gordon (another hoot--how many mob bosses are named Gordon?) with aplomb, and Michael Fox has a very amusing cameo as Gordon's accountant.Cosmo is single and even though he loves his job--taught him by experienced hitman Steve (Peter Reigert)--he wants to be in love.  The only &quot;love&quot; he has ever known is via Honey, a matter-of-fact, all business hooker played very well by Janeann Garofalo.  He meets Jasmine, a yoga instructor, and pretty soon they are connecting.  Along the way, Cosmo carries out a string of hits, most supervised by Steve, that show off the excellent black humor on display here.The ending is very satisfying; the writer-director, Wally Wolodarsky, does a great job of combining the themes of love and violence right at the endpoint that underlines how acidly funny the film is.  Will Jasmine and Cosmo find real love together or not?  The ending provides a great answer.A shame this did not make it to DVD.

384717,A17UMIEH0APRNU,6303679021,Raegan Butcher,"[13, 14]","I went to see this at the Seattle International Film Festival in 1995. I went because the synopsis sounded interesting. Plus the guy who had written and directed it was connected with the Simpsons, surely a major plus when it comes to comedy. The audience was filled with teenage girls, obviously drawn by the name of Jason Priestly on the marquee. It made the subsequent viewing of the film THAT much funnier (well, at least to me) to sit there and wonder what these girls were thinking as the film progressed and Priestly started killing folks with such wonderful deadpan indifference.This movie is SCREAMINGLY funny. Peter Reigert is top-flight comedy gold in every scene he has as the burned-out veteran hit-man. The real revelation is how funny Jason Priestly can be when given a chance. His character here is almost like Peter Sellers from BEING THERE; he is so impassive and deadpan, yet the film revolves around his performance and it must be good for a film like this to work; well, Priestly delivers. His character is goofy and sweet and yet somehow chilling too in his casual attitude to murder. Why this film has languished in total obscurity is a mystery. When i saw the film, most of the audience didn't know what to think; the teenage girlies were rather shocked;they didn't find it amusing to see their 90210 heartthrob pistol-whipping people before icing them, but I did. When the film ended, the director, Wallace Wolodarsky, was just sitting there, alone.He had introduced the film briefly beforehand and said he'd be happy to field questions when it was over. I approached him (since no one else was going to) and I think I frightened him a bit with my exuberance; I had a shaved head at the time and i looked a bit weird and I said, too loudly, ""That movie was brilliant! It was hilarious!"" He said,""Thank you,"" and slowly backed away from me. I thought, ""well, you can't win them all."" And I left him in the theater filled with people who didn't understand his movie.",5,hilarious black comedy--criminally under-appreciated,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,1989,"['went', 'see', 'Seattle', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', '1995', 'went', 'synopsis', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'written', 'directed', 'was', 'connected', 'Simpsons', 'surely', 'major', 'plus', 'when', 'comedy', 'audience', 'was', 'filled', 'teenage', 'girls', 'obviously', 'drawn', 'name', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'marquee', 'made', 'subsequent', 'viewing', 'film', 'THAT', 'much', 'funnier', 'well', 'least', 'sit', 'there', 'wonder', 'what', 'girls', 'were', 'thinking', 'film', 'progressed', 'Priestly', 'started', 'killing', 'folks', 'such', 'wonderful', 'deadpan', 'indifference.This', 'movie', 'SCREAMINGLY', 'funny', 'Peter', 'Reigert', 'top-flight', 'comedy', 'gold', 'scene', 'burned-out', 'veteran', 'hit-man', 'real', 'revelation', 'how', 'funny', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'character', 'here', 'almost', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'BEING', 'THERE', 'so', 'impassive', 'deadpan', 'film', 'performance', 'must', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'work', 'well', 'Priestly', 'character', 'goofy', 'sweet', 'yet', 'somehow', 'chilling', 'too', 'casual', 'attitude', 'murder', 'Why', 'film', 'languished', 'total', 'obscurity', 'mystery', 'When', 'i', 'saw', 'film', 'most', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'teenage', 'girlies', 'were', 'rather', 'shocked', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'amusing', 'see', '90210', 'heartthrob', 'pistol-whipping', 'people', 'icing', 'did', 'When', 'film', 'ended', 'director', 'Wallace', 'Wolodarsky', 'was', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'alone.He', 'had', 'introduced', 'film', 'briefly', 'beforehand', 'said', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'field', 'questions', 'when', 'was', 'approached', 'one', 'else', 'was', 'going', 'think', 'frightened', 'bit', 'exuberance', 'had', 'shaved', 'head', 'time', 'i', 'looked', 'bit', 'weird', 'said', 'too', 'loudly', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'was', 'hilarious', 'said', 'Thank', 'slowly', 'backed', 'away', 'thought', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'left', 'theater', 'filled', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'movie']","Cold Blooded aka ""Coldblooded""  VHS"
