I was never a big fan of his feature films. They always seemed to keep Pryor's brand of comedy reigned in. His stand-up comedy was where it was at: pure, undiluted Pryor. This new DVD set captures two of his live concert films, Live on the Sunset Strip and Here and Now and present two fascinating snapshots of the man at different points in his career and life.His material carries on in the proud, taboo-smashing tradition of Lenny Bruce. Pryor talks about things that aren't supposed to be discussed in public: masturbating, religion, and politics in a frank and very funny way. He also employs the same kind of hipster-speak shtick as Bruce but updated for the late `70s and early `80s. Pryor also has the same improvisational quality, able to react to a spontaneous comment from the audience without losing his cool.With a biopic in the works (it should be interesting to see how it compares to his semi-autobiographical movie, Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life is Calling) there will no doubt be renewed interest in Pryor and his work. These two films document two specific points in his life and show the man in his prime. They also reinforce how influential he was on the contemporary comedians who idolize him.",4,Pryor in his prime.,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,1392,"['safe', 'say', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'would', 'be', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Dave', 'Chappelle-comedians', 'who', 'mine', 'lot', 'same', 'territory', 'Pryor', 'had', 'already', 'covered', '1970s', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'feature', 'films', 'always', 'seemed', 'keep', 'Pryor', 'brand', 'comedy', 'reigned', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'was', 'where', 'was', 'pure', 'undiluted', 'Pryor', 'new', 'DVD', 'set', 'captures', 'two', 'live', 'concert', 'films', 'Live', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Here', 'Now', 'present', 'two', 'fascinating', 'snapshots', 'man', 'different', 'points', 'career', 'life.His', 'material', 'proud', 'taboo-smashing', 'tradition', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'Pryor', 'talks', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'discussed', 'public', 'masturbating', 'religion', 'politics', 'frank', 'very', 'funny', 'way', 'also', 'same', 'kind', 'hipster-speak', 'shtick', 'Bruce', 'updated', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'Pryor', 'also', 'same', 'improvisational', 'quality', 'able', 'react', 'spontaneous', 'comment', 'audience', 'losing', 'cool.With', 'biopic', 'works', 'should', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'semi-autobiographical', 'movie', 'Jo', 'Jo', 'Dancer', 'Your', 'Life', 'Calling', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'renewed', 'interest', 'Pryor', 'work', 'two', 'films', 'document', 'two', 'specific', 'points', 'life', 'show', 'man', 'prime', 'also', 'reinforce', 'how', 'influential', 'was', 'contemporary', 'comedians', 'who', 'idolize']",N/A

Forget Richard Pryor's occasionally shaky film work; stand-up comedy is where he truly belongs. Filmed two years in a row, ""Live on the Sunset Strip"" and ""Here and Now"" remind us why Pryor was so good at comedy.Armed with only a microphone and his signature mustache, Pryor fires scatter-shot at everything, but mostly himself. From his dangerous dances with drugs, sex, prison, white people & rednecks, drinking & vomiting to visiting the African bush, Pryor can find humor in any precarious situation.LOTSS is probably the stronger of the two, a fast-paced concert that of course, touches on his then-recent controversy of accidentally setting himself on fire (""The Real Story? I was having some milk & cookies..."").HAN is razor-sharp as well. Pryor even does a routine with a live hermit crab an audience member brings to him--no kidding! The material sags a bit near the end, but it's pure brilliance all the way through.As Pryor himself has mentioned when complaints about his profanity arised: ""I've never said dirty words just for shock value. Every bad word has a story or meaning behind it. In other words, there's always substance.""And what better way to celebrate his comic legacy than with this DVD concert double feature.
