1156767,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0017CW5PI,David Baldwin,"[8, 8]","Whoever's bright idea it was to pair these two seemingly disparate comedies in one package falls into that gray area of genius and insanity.  My opinion falls into the former camp.  Before the days of mega-plexes I used to love it when the cinemas showed double-bills(sometimes triple).  You never knew what you were going to get.  My all-time favorite pairing is ""The Story of O"" and ""E.T."".  Don't ask.  I remember in the winter months the local UHF station used to show beach movies.  The Frankie-Annette vehicles were the best of the bunch.  They weren't great but they were disarming and helped keep the chill off your bones.  To me ""Back to the Beach"" serves the same purpose as TV's ""Happy Days"".  It's a nostalgia trip about nostalgia.  It's kind of like the ""Brady Bunch"" movies they made in the Nineties whereas Frankie and Annette have emotional ties to the early Sixties but have to confront a more permissive Eighties culture.  Since this was released in 1987 you have nostalgia for both the Sixties and Eighties if you're so inclined.  The comedy is more on a sitcom level but I had a persistent smile on my face.  The real bonus here are the numerous celebrity cameos notably Stevie Ray Vaughn and Pee-Wee Herman.  O.J. Simpson's cameo can be forgiven because his notoriety didn't start until several years later.  I used to watch Comedy Central in the Nineties when they showed ""Ab-Fab"" and ""The Young Ones"".  ""Kids in the Hall"" were on but it never really piqued my interest.  After seeing ""Brain Candy"" I may have to revisit the series.  If a description of this flick could be used it would be ""Pythonesque"".  That said, the Pythons didn't follow normal story structures whereas ""Brain Candy"" has more of a linear story line.  Lot's of sacred cows are skewed here but none more than the pharmaceutical industry.  The comedy is dark but you'll being laughing hysterically despite yourself.  This is a terrific pairing and for any fan of comedy this release is essential.",5,Smashing Double-Bill,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,1988,"['Whoever', 'bright', 'idea', 'was', 'pair', 'two', 'seemingly', 'disparate', 'comedies', 'one', 'package', 'gray', 'area', 'genius', 'insanity', 'opinion', 'former', 'camp', 'days', 'mega-plexes', 'used', 'love', 'when', 'cinemas', 'showed', 'double-bills', 'sometimes', 'triple', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'get', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'pairing', 'Story', 'O', 'E.T.', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'remember', 'winter', 'months', 'local', 'UHF', 'station', 'used', 'show', 'beach', 'movies', 'Frankie-Annette', 'vehicles', 'were', 'best', 'bunch', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'were', 'disarming', 'helped', 'keep', 'chill', 'bones', 'Back', 'Beach', 'same', 'purpose', 'TV', 'Happy', 'Days', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'nostalgia', 'kind', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'movies', 'made', 'Nineties', 'whereas', 'Frankie', 'Annette', 'have', 'emotional', 'ties', 'early', 'Sixties', 'have', 'confront', 'more', 'permissive', 'Eighties', 'culture', 'was', 'released', '1987', 'have', 'nostalgia', 'Sixties', 'Eighties', ""'re"", 'so', 'inclined', 'comedy', 'more', 'sitcom', 'level', 'had', 'persistent', 'smile', 'face', 'real', 'bonus', 'here', 'are', 'numerous', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'notably', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughn', 'Pee-Wee', 'Herman', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'cameo', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'notoriety', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'used', 'watch', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Nineties', 'when', 'showed', 'Ab-Fab', 'Young', 'Ones', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'piqued', 'interest', 'seeing', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'may', 'have', 'revisit', 'series', 'description', 'flick', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'would', 'be', 'Pythonesque', 'said', 'Pythons', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'normal', 'story', 'structures', 'whereas', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'more', 'linear', 'story', 'line', 'Lot', 'sacred', 'cows', 'are', 'skewed', 'here', 'none', 'more', 'pharmaceutical', 'industry', 'comedy', 'dark', ""'ll"", 'being', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'terrific', 'pairing', 'fan', 'comedy', 'release', 'essential']",Back to the Beach / Brain Candy

It is really funny, there are fun songs and silly dances.  In my book, it's a classic and I love it.

1156770,A3MO699KPZP0LM,B0017CW5PI,jd,"[4, 5]","This is a difficult review for me to write.  I purchased this Double Feature soley for the Kids in the Hall classic Brain Candy.  As big as The Kids in the Hall were, in their day, I am surprised how difficult Brain Candy is to find.  I was even more surprised to see it paired with a beach movie spoof.How rare must it be to find a fan who loves both movies?  So, I was not surprised to see people baffled by the movie Brain Candy.  If you didn't watch The Kids in the Hall, and just happened on to this movie as part of a double feature...then you are no doubt stunned by Brain Candy.  Good, be stunned, that is exactly what made the Kids so relevant.  They were a Lorne Michaels (SNL) ""discovery"" around 1989 or so, who were undoubtedly shunned by the mainstream due to their brand of comedy....the world wasn't over it's homophobia yet.  And, they had 5 super successful seasons on spanning HBO and Comedy Central (if I am remembering correctly).  But, their humor was a bit much for prime time...or even ""not ready for prime time"". They were doing skits that made SNL skits seem like something you'd find on Sesame Street.  While Dana Carvey was dressing up like the Church Lady and saying ""Isn't that special?"", the Kids were dressing up like hookers, office women, Queen Elizabeth, white trash girlfriends, etc and bypassing the catch phrases for some of the most hilarious bits known to sketch comedy.  Each of the Kids, independently, could have been considered the most diverse sketch comedy actor in his day...much less all of them together. Even now it is difficult to write about the Kids and not get a sinking, nostalgic feeling in my stomach.  The Kids in the Hall had a way of delivering their characters that was so convincing that each one seemed like a real person, seperate from the actor.  But, I digress...The movie Brain Candy contains a decent mixture of those classic characters, and the creation of some new ones to love.  Mark McKinney's pharmacutical company CEO is based (more than loosely) on Lorne Michaels himself.  He is the CEO of a waning drug company in search of the next big drug.  The Kids, as a group of misfit scientist, discover a drug that will trap you in your most fond memory (complete with hilrious flashbacks of those memories).  In line with reality, the drug company rushes it into production before the downsides are fully known.  The drug is on the way to solving all of the world's problems when things go wrong.  The Kids play all main characters, and with spot-on accuracy as usual.  Keep an eye out for Scott Thompson as the husband who is in denial about his ""orientation"", this character alone provides numerous memorable laughs.I don't know about Back to the Beach because I haven't, and probably won't watch it. Any true fan of Brain Candy couldn't possibly make the transition from the Kids to Frankie, Annette, and Gilligan.  But I do know that Brain Candy is cutting edge comedy that, if I were to take the pill Gleemonex, would result in me being trapped in a moment in the early 90's when The Kids in the Hall ruled the sketch comedy world.",4,Brain Candy Too Smart of a Comedy to be Paired with Back to the Beach,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,3105,"['difficult', 'review', 'write', 'purchased', 'Double', 'Feature', 'soley', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'classic', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'As', 'big', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'were', 'day', 'am', 'surprised', 'how', 'difficult', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'find', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'surprised', 'see', 'paired', 'beach', 'movie', 'spoof.How', 'rare', 'must', 'be', 'find', 'fan', 'who', 'movies', 'So', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'see', 'people', 'baffled', 'movie', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'just', 'happened', 'movie', 'part', 'double', 'feature', 'then', 'are', 'doubt', 'stunned', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'Good', 'be', 'stunned', 'exactly', 'what', 'made', 'Kids', 'so', 'relevant', 'were', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'SNL', 'discovery', '1989', 'so', 'who', 'were', 'undoubtedly', 'shunned', 'mainstream', 'due', 'brand', 'comedy', '.the', 'world', 'was', ""n't"", 'homophobia', 'yet', 'had', '5', 'super', 'successful', 'seasons', 'spanning', 'HBO', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'am', 'remembering', 'correctly', 'humor', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'prime', 'time', 'even', 'not', 'ready', 'prime', 'time', 'were', 'doing', 'skits', 'made', 'SNL', 'skits', 'seem', 'something', ""'d"", 'find', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'was', 'dressing', 'up', 'Church', 'Lady', 'saying', ""n't"", 'special', 'Kids', 'were', 'dressing', 'up', 'hookers', 'office', 'women', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'white', 'trash', 'girlfriends', 'etc', 'bypassing', 'catch', 'most', 'hilarious', 'bits', 'known', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'Kids', 'independently', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'most', 'diverse', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'actor', 'day', 'much', 'less', 'together', 'Even', 'now', 'difficult', 'write', 'Kids', 'not', 'get', 'sinking', 'nostalgic', 'feeling', 'stomach', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'had', 'way', 'delivering', 'characters', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'one', 'seemed', 'real', 'person', 'seperate', 'actor', 'digress', 'movie', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'decent', 'mixture', 'classic', 'characters', 'creation', 'new', 'ones', 'love', 'Mark', 'McKinney', 'pharmacutical', 'company', 'CEO', 'based', 'more', 'loosely', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'CEO', 'waning', 'drug', 'company', 'search', 'next', 'big', 'drug', 'Kids', 'group', 'misfit', 'scientist', 'discover', 'drug', 'will', 'trap', 'most', 'fond', 'memory', 'complete', 'hilrious', 'flashbacks', 'memories', 'line', 'reality', 'drug', 'company', 'production', 'downsides', 'are', 'fully', 'known', 'drug', 'way', 'solving', 'world', 'problems', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Kids', 'play', 'main', 'characters', 'spot-on', 'accuracy', 'usual', 'Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'Scott', 'Thompson', 'husband', 'who', 'denial', 'orientation', 'character', 'alone', 'numerous', 'memorable', 'laughs.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'Back', 'Beach', 'have', ""n't"", 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Any', 'true', 'fan', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'make', 'transition', 'Kids', 'Frankie', 'Annette', 'Gilligan', 'do', 'know', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'cutting', 'edge', 'comedy', 'were', 'take', 'pill', 'Gleemonex', 'would', 'result', 'being', 'trapped', 'moment', 'early', '90', 'when', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'ruled', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'world']",Back to the Beach / Brain Candy
