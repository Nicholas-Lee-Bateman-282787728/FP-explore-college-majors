1016252,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000HT3P7E,A. Gammill,"[4, 7]","I have to tell you, I'm something of a t.v. snob.  I haven't really enjoyed a half-hour comedy since Titus was cancelled.  All the dramas on t.v. seem to be doctor, lawyer, or cop shows (boring).  And I'll set myself on fire before I'll waste time on a ""reality"" show on one of those prime-time game shows.So I was delighted to discover this little gem of a show on CBS's Monday night lineup.  I initially tuned it because 2 of the 5 regular cast members were on two of the greatest t.v. shows ever: Alyson Hannigan from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Jason Segel from Freaks and Geeks.  And I was just as surprised as anyone else when I soon realized the real scene-stealer was Neil Patrick Harris.  Barney Stinson is a classic character, and it's a crime if Harris doesn't nab an Emmy nomination.It must be hard to come up with fresh material for a sitcom. . .but somehow, the writers manage to pull it off.  Plus, the cast easily has the best chemistry since ""Friends"" (rivaled this season only by the cast of ""The Class,"" another criminally-underrated show).  Marshall and Lily (Segel and Hannigan) are TV's Best Couple.But let's talk Emmy's again for a second.  ""Drumroll, Please"" is not only the season one highlight, I would rank in in the top 10 sitcom episodes EVER.  In case you missed it (SPOILERS), Ted meets a woman at a wedding, and the two spend a perfect evening together while vowing NOT to see each ever again.  You have to see it to get the full impact, but it's funny and touching and very original.Several people have complained about the DVD's being released full-frame.  I don't personally own a widescreen t.v., and I don't know anyone who does.  If it's that important to you, record the shows off the air. . .if you can afford a widescreen t.v., you can surely get a DVD recorder or DVR or whatever.We always look forward to Monday nights at my house.  Now, thanks to DVD, we can watch this great show anytime.

1016260,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000HT3P7E,Brett Corkins,"[1, 2]","How I Met Your Mother is one of those shows that remains funny no matter how many times you see it. Trust me when I say this because I've seen this season 10+ times, and continue to rewatch it to this day.I'm often asked what it is about HIMYM that makes me love it so much and the answer invariably comes back as ""the cast."" Everything about this group of characters is perfect. I see Marshall and Ted together and they genuinely act like friends that have been together for years. I look at Marshall and Lily and find myself wanting a relationship like their's. I see Barney and believe he really is this womanizing suit lover. I see Robin and I actually do see a person obssessed with her job. The creators did a phenominal job casting this show and episode after episode proves it.There are many ways of describing the type of show HIMYM is. It is a comedy. It does have some very tender moments. It is wacky at times. Those things are true. But there's an intangible that this show has that others lack...heart. I haven't cared about a group of characters this much since Scrubs. I constantly find myself comparing my group of friends to HIMYM's. I watch this show because it portrays events in life we all go through in a relateable way. In a way that isn't forced to be funny.Season one introduces us to the characters. We see Marshall propose to Lily in the very first episode. We see Ted profess his love for Robin on their first date. We see Barney...well...be Barney. As the series goes on it only picks up steam and gets better. It's as if the creators knew they had to make us care about the cast, and once they did that, they ran with it. We really want to see Ted find his soulmate because he is such a good guy. Yet, when everything ultimately fails, we still care. And when he does the rain dance on the roof to try and get Robin, we root for him. When Lily leaves Marshall and Ted finds him sitting on the front steps holding the ring, your heart breaks for him.Season one is a great season with tons of memorable episodes, a season that lays groundwork for the show to only get better.

1016264,A12SHC9IT3VZQG,B000HT3P7E,Daniel Sweeney,"[22, 136]","Okay, so my brother got me season one of ""How I Met Your Mother"" for Christmas, and swore it was the best comedy on TV.  I was willing to give it a shot; I'm somewhat of a Jason Segal fan from his Freaks and Geeks turn and we all know how funny Neil Patrick Harris can be (witness his scene stealing performance in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle).  So I had reason to expect an enjoyable program.So what's the verdict?When I was 17, I had an infected wisdom tooth pulled out and my mouth swelled and oozed pus for a week. I could only eat Gerber's baby food and fluids.  All in all, it was the most crappy experience ever.Until I watched ""How I Met Your Mother.""If we lived in Ancient Rome, I was Emperor Commodos and I was watching this in the Colisseum...I would have given thumbs down to the whole proceeding with the hope that gladiators would come in wielding maces and destroy the bar and the apartment sets, where 99% of the show seems to take place.  However, had this show really existed way back then, the Roman Empire would have collapsed a lot sooner than it did.Evidently, Some mad scientist pinpricked Jimmy Fallon's pinky, fertilized an egg with his DNA and out popped a fully-formed Josh Radnor, the lead actor of this show. Cloning Dolly the sheep was bad enough, but this is an affront to all ethics and morals, let alone good taste.  One small step for man, one giant leap BACKWARDS as far as comedy is concerned.The uninspired, trite, and obvious comedy writing doesn't help, but it might have been surviveable had the characterizations been at all passable. But it is impossible for me to relate to these people. Self-absorbed narcissism was funny on Seinfeld because that was an irreverant and funny show, nobody was meant to like those characters.  But here, I would never want to be associated with these people in real life, let alone watch caricatures of them on TV.  It's Seinfeld without the humor.  And in case you were wondering, the humor was about 99.99999% of Seinfeld.  So what that means is that HIMYM is .00001% as funny.Apparently, I am the lone dissenting opinion on this show, since every other Amazon reviewer raves about it.  I'm okay with that.

1016278,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B000HT3P7E,Haunted Flower,"[2, 4]","22 Episodes on 3 DVD Discs""How I Met Your Mother"" begins with a premise that this is a man (Bob Saget) telling a VERY long story to his children about how he met their mother. The children are in several intros at the beginning of the series and then gradually vanish. Once you've established the premise that this is a story from one person's perspective and is occasionally made up of stories they've been told from another person's point of view...it's all fair game for silliness. Like if one of them tells a story about sneaking out of the apartment by jumping from a three story window and landing on the ground with cat-like reflexes. This is a friends situational comedy with elements familiar from ""Friends"" and ""Seinfeld"" like this is a group of five friends who always gather at the same social place where they can have beverages and talk about their problems and mingle with others.Ted played by Josh Radnor is a hopeless romantic architect and hopeless in general. He's a total girl. He blows it on a first date with Robin the news anchor (Cobie Smulders, what an awesome name which she totally earns in the pilot) right away by confessing his love for her which weirds her out royally. What comes out of this is she joins their friend group for the rest of the series while Ted pines away for her which is an annoying waste of time since Bob Saget always refers to her as ""Aunt Robin"" aka NOT the mother. Ted's best friend and roommate is Marshall the lawyer played by Jason Segel who proposes to his girlfriend of nine years in the pilot, Lily played by Alyson Hannigan from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Marshall and Lily are an adorable married couple and give the rest of us a normal place to view the others from most of the time. They are great friends of Ted's but are also like his parents giving him advice, commands, and criticism. Since you can't have a show without a wacky fifth wheel guy, in waltzes suited up Barney brilliantly played by Neil Patrick Harris. He is the entire reason to start watching this show as his comedy is the best element in it, especially here in season 1 where others are still finding themselves.Ted is obsessed with Robin all season except for a brief hiatus with a pretty cupcake maker that he tries to have a long distance relationship with in Germany (By the way, as someone who has LOTS of experience shipping internationally -- cupcakes would NOT arrive perfectly in a care package like they do in this show!!). That poor girl never had a chance. Ted is totally in love with someone till they aren't directly in front of him and then those creeping doubts show up and swarm him.In Season 1, you can learn more about how Lily and Marshall met, find out how, when, and why Barney first suited up, and see Robin's most humiliating moment, but there are two things you won't find out: what Barney does for a living and who the mother is. Since I saw season 5 first and decided to start back at the beginning, I already know that no one knows who the mother is in season 5 either. It'll take a while so might as well enjoy the silly ride.Bonus Features:There is audio commentary on select episodes, early ones have cast members all together goofing off reminiscing the good times and later ones have show creators and members of the band who wrote the little diddy that is the theme music and won't stop mentioning their band. Might as well pimp their MySpace page while they're at it. ""First Round"" is a series of quick funny moments and many high fives put to music (PROBABLY by the same band that does the intro), ""Happy Hour"" is a blooper reel that includes the green testicle Ultimate Frisbee story that everyone keeps laughing at and Jason Segel's cell phone goes off among other stuff, and ""Last Call"" is just the same as ""First Round"" but different silly moments.""Happy Hour"" is the video yearbook for the freshman year of the series where the creators talk about how one of them based the couple off himself and his wife and the other based Ted off himself. They discuss casting for Ted (""Josh was...handsome enough"") and how Josh apparently nailed the ultra mushy monologue at the end of the pilot and the casting director asked if he'd marry her. I think I just threw up in my mouth a little. As much as I enjoy love stories, when it gets super mushy and unproductive as with Ted, I get annoyed. They actually had to wait for Jason Segel since he was attached to another sitcom at the time and the creator's wife would only be ok with a character being based on her if she was played by someone sweet and funny like Alyson Hannigan. They loved Cobie for her confidence and ability to sparkle wonderfully in close-ups. They wrote Barney as a heavy-set ""Animal House"" type and didn't have NPH in mind, but he auditioned with extraordinary energy in the laser tag scene knocking things over and they gave him the part.They apparently get lots of angry comments about the Ted and Robin romance since she isn't the mother but defend themselves saying that isn't the story they wanted to tell. Ted's need for perfection and obsession with love apparently needs to take a journey through pursuing a relationship with Robin (spoiler: He does not chill out by Season 5, he is still nuts).

1016279,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000HT3P7E,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 5]","Ever since FRIENDS called it a day I haven't really been tuning in to much TV sitcom stuff. HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER andTwo and a Half Men - The Complete First Seasonare just about the only sitcoms I've kept an eye on. Of the two, I like HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER just a bit better. I think it's got more heart, and it's certainly introduced ""Awesome!"" back into prime-time vocabulary. Anyway, its season one hooked me in.That same old premise: a bunch of friends wending their way thru life and love in N.Y.C. Ted Mosby (the pleasant looking Josh Radnor) is at the heart of the show, the idealistic, wide-eyed romantic and our point-of-view character. Lily (BUFFY's Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall (FREAK & GEEK's Jason Segel) are the cute couple and Ted's roommates. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) is the subversive buddy, and, c'mon, it's always nice to have one in the pack, right? Robin (beautiful Cobie Smulders) is the newcomer to the gang, and the dangling romantic interest for Ted. Most of the characters dwell in an apartment right above a bar, so you can imagine where they most hang out.This series uses a gimmick in which, in the year 2030, an off-camera older Ted (voiced by Bob Saget) tells his future kids how he met their mother. It's taking a really long time for Older Ted to tell this story. Sweetness and snarkiness consistently hobnob in these episodes. From Ted's old-fashioned romantic leanings and Lily and Marshall's steady relationship to Barney's casual immorality and narcissism. The show even makes effective use of quick comedy cuts ala FAMILY GUY. But the big question is, of course, will Ted and Robin ever get together?Just check out the cast episode commentaries, and you can tell these folks like each other. Even though the main story arc centers on Ted, this is pretty much an ensemble cast. Everyone gets a slice of the spotlight. Radnor, Smulders, and Hannigan are fine, but, to me, the two people who stand out and provide most of the humor are scene-stealers Segel and Harris. Jason Segel's character is a sweet, good-natured, shambling kind of dude, a looming kid at heart who also does a mean robot. Well, okay, his robot sucks. But dude's funny.An indispensable ingredient to the show's success is the energetic and smarmy Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser, M.D. - Season One,Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (Unrated Extended Edition)). The show's creators had originally imagined Barney as more of a manic Jack Black type, but Harris' gung-ho audition apparently made them do a swift one-eighty, and the rest is ""legendary."" Now I can't get all these Barney-isms out of my noggin, from ""Suit up!"" to ""Have you met Ted?"" to, yes, ""legendary."" Old Doogie, more than anyone else on this show, keeps the season-long romantic arc from being too saccharine.ANGEL fans might be stoked to see Amy Acker guest star in one episode (""Come On"") and Alexis Denisof, who's Hannigan's hubby in real, appear in several episodes as Robin's co-anchor Sandy Rivers. Also memorable is Ashley Williams as Ted's cool culinary girlfriend Victoria.Even though the show loses steam in the later episodes - and I felt the final episode underwhelmed (Rain dance? Really?) - the dropoff isn't that significant. And, throughout, HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER retains its heart. Several standout episodes are the ""Pilot"" ('cause it's the friggin' pilot), ""Okay Awesome"" (the sub-title show), ""The Pineapple Incident"" (Ted gets drunk, but remains ""vomit free since '93""), ""The Limo"" (trapped in a limo with crazy Moby), and Game Night"" (the origin of Barney).HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - SEASON ONE includes ""Video Yearbook"" (the 20-minute-long behind the scenes featurette) and ""Happy Hour"" (9 minutes worth of outtakes, and pretty funny). There are cast & crew audio commentaries on six episodes, and here's the thing: If you're looking for insights and background into the series, then select the writers' episode commentaries, although these cats were kind of boring and annoying. If you want comfy camaraderie with random babbletalk, then select the cast commentaries. You don't learn much from the cast, but they were fun to listen to.Wait a mo.

Every episode Ted (Josh Radnor)tells his children a story that is supposed to lead-up to how he met their mom. But he never actually gets to how he met their mom which is kinda funny in it's own right. Even if it's obvious that we probably won't learn who he married until the series finale which hopefully is a few years from now.Anyway this season mostly has Ted trying to find the one after his best friend Marshall asks his g/f Lilly (Alyson Hannigan of Buffy fame) to Marry him. His friend Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) ""who he wonders why he's friends with in the first place"" has weird scheme after weird scheme to pick-up women. One joke that I never get tired of, is when Barney taps a random girl on the shouler and says ""have you met Ted ?"". Which actually helps him talk to the woman of his dreams one night. She's a news reporter named Robin (Cobie Smulders) on a channel nobody watches. After awhile they decide to just hang-out since he wants something serious and she doesn't.The show is refreshing and fun with a good cast and if you miss Friends I strongly recommend that you watch this. Neil Patrick Harris does a good job getting his career rolling again with this show. He's a real scene stealer. Which is another good reason to watch the show. Hannigan and Smulders are both really good reasons to watch it too. Since they both are really cute. Plus as an actor I never saw before Josh Radnor does a good job as the lead of the series. His date scenes can be pretty funny and maybe a little insightful too. Since if you're guy you should probably never say or do what he does. Like never tell a girl you love her on your first date or break-up with her on her birthday...2 times.",4,If you miss Friends....Watch This!,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,1834,"['How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'best', 'sitcom', 'hit', 'CBS', 'King', 'Queens', 'best', 'show', 'friends', '.since', 'Friends', 'episode', 'Ted', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'children', 'story', 'supposed', 'lead-up', 'how', 'met', 'mom', 'never', 'actually', 'how', 'met', 'mom', 'kinda', 'funny', 'own', 'right', 'Even', 'obvious', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', 'who', 'married', 'series', 'finale', 'hopefully', 'few', 'years', 'now.Anyway', 'season', 'mostly', 'Ted', 'trying', 'find', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'Marshall', 'g/f', 'Lilly', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Buffy', 'fame', 'Marry', 'friend', 'Barney', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'who', 'why', 'friends', 'first', 'place', 'weird', 'scheme', 'weird', 'scheme', 'pick-up', 'women', 'One', 'joke', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'when', 'Barney', 'random', 'girl', 'shouler', 'have', 'met', 'Ted', 'Which', 'actually', 'talk', 'woman', 'dreams', 'one', 'night', 'news', 'reporter', 'named', 'Robin', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'channel', 'nobody', 'watches', 'decide', 'just', 'hang-out', 'something', 'serious', 'show', 'refreshing', 'fun', 'good', 'cast', 'miss', 'Friends', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'career', 'rolling', 'again', 'show', 'real', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Which', 'good', 'reason', 'watch', 'show', 'Hannigan', 'Smulders', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'reasons', 'watch', 'too', 'are', 'really', 'cute', 'actor', 'never', 'saw', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'good', 'job', 'lead', 'series', 'date', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'funny', 'maybe', 'little', 'insightful', 'too', ""'re"", 'guy', 'should', 'probably', 'never', 'say', 'do', 'what', 'never', 'tell', 'girl', 'love', 'first', 'date', 'break-up', 'birthday', '2', 'times']",How I Met Your Mother: Season 1

1016296,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000HT3P7E,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[20, 21]","How I Met Your Mother is a Friends-like comedy about five twentysomethings (Lily, Marshall, Ted, Robin, and Barney) in New York. Lily, a kindergarten teacher, and Marshall, an aspiring attorney, have been together for the last nine years and in the first episode they become engaged. Ted, an architect and Marshall's roommate and best friend, has been looking at their perfect relationship for the last nine years and decides that it's time for him to find his own someone special. Barney, who wears suits just about everywhere, is Ted's other best friend and the most hilarious character on the show. And finally Robin, a tv news reporter, just joins the group when Ted decides that she might be the one.The story is told from Ted's point of view and the show is basically a love story in reverse. In the year 2030, Ted is telling two teenagers the story of how he met their mother beginning with the escapades he and his friends had in the year 2005. The five of them hang out at MacLaren's (their Central Perk) and try to navigate planning a wedding, finding a soul mate, and having legendary moments on a day to day basis. Each episode brings us closer to finding out who the ""mother"" is, but it's left to the viewer to wonder if the woman in question is Ted's wife or if these are even his kids.How I Met Your Mother is easily one of the funniest shows on television right now. Each episode is full of hilarious one-liners, and Barney's lines alone are enough to make you laugh out loud. I don't know how I missed this show the first time around, but I'm grateful it's on DVD.

1016298,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B000HT3P7E,MacJunegrand,"[1, 1]","I never watched this show while it was on TV.  I barely heard about it, and the few things I heard, such as its premise, didn't interest me, so I gave it a pass.  But then, so many people recommended it to me, I decided to give it a go on Netflix.So, I have to say, it was really, REALLY hard to get into it.  I mean, yes, the first season had some funny moments and interesting characters, but I found main character Ted Mosby to be so irritatingly unlikable that it turned me off all the time.  Whenever I started getting into the show the guy did something incredibly stupid, and not the kind of stupid thing that's funny, like what Friends' Joey Tribianni might do.  I'm talking about the kind of stupid thing  that makes you rage and despise the guy for being such an obnoxious jerk.The only time I found Ted likable was in the penultimate episode of the season, and it was only because they forced all the other characters into being even more unlikable jerks, so Ted turned out to be the only straight man in the episode.  It all changed in the last episode, in which the plot involves Ted wanting to get back with the girl he likes (Robin) by trying to make a rain dance in order to summon rain and prevent her from taking a flight.  I was already increasingly raging at the guy's egotistical ignoring of everyone else's feelings and his constant attempts to turn the tides of fate to his side without any care for what others wanted, so when he ACTUALLY made it rain and the episode treated that as a good thing, I said ""That's it!  I'm through with this stupid show!""But then...The episode ended into sort of a cliffhanger.  Ted got to be with Robin despite the fact that he did not deserve it, but his best friend Marshall got abandoned by his fianc&eacute;e Lily, and I felt really sad for him, since he was the only character I felt sympathy for.  So I decided to give the second season a go, at least to see if there was some justice, the tables turned and the guy who really deserved to be happy (Marshall) got his happiness back.And something completely unexpected happened.  From season two on, the show was AMAZING.  Everything I hated from the first season was gone and everything I liked returned in droves.  Ted was no longer a jackass, Robin was no longer useless, and everone showed new interesting sides to them.  Heck, even that stupid rain dance scene was actually retconned to be just a coincidence in later seasons.  Plus, the show was now really FUNNY.  Season one had some laughs here and there, but rarely anything laugh-out-loud funny.  Since the first episode of season two, though, the show has been hilarious.I don't know what happened.  I don't know if the first season was written by someone else, or whomever wrote it realized it was crap and decided to make it all better later, but I can tell that every season I've watched non-stop since the first once (I'm at sixth right now) has been absolutely amazing and truly deserving of a 5-star rating.  So, I say, while it's impossible to ignore the first season if you intend to get the story, everything becomes much, much better later and it's worth to go through this rough start in order to get to the next, impeccable seasons.",2,"I love the show, but the first season...",1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,3217,"['never', 'watched', 'show', 'was', 'TV', 'barely', 'heard', 'few', 'things', 'heard', 'such', 'premise', 'did', ""n't"", 'interest', 'gave', 'pass', 'then', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'recommended', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'Netflix.So', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'REALLY', 'get', 'mean', 'yes', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'interesting', 'characters', 'found', 'main', 'character', 'Ted', 'Mosby', 'be', 'so', 'irritatingly', 'unlikable', 'turned', 'off', 'time', 'Whenever', 'started', 'getting', 'show', 'guy', 'did', 'something', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'not', 'kind', 'stupid', 'thing', 'funny', 'what', 'Friends', 'Joey', 'Tribianni', 'might', 'do', ""'m"", 'talking', 'kind', 'stupid', 'thing', 'rage', 'despise', 'guy', 'being', 'such', 'obnoxious', 'jerk.The', 'only', 'time', 'found', 'Ted', 'likable', 'was', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'season', 'was', 'only', 'forced', 'other', 'characters', 'being', 'even', 'more', 'unlikable', 'jerks', 'so', 'Ted', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'straight', 'man', 'episode', 'changed', 'last', 'episode', 'plot', 'Ted', 'wanting', 'get', 'back', 'girl', 'Robin', 'trying', 'make', 'rain', 'dance', 'order', 'summon', 'rain', 'prevent', 'taking', 'flight', 'was', 'already', 'increasingly', 'raging', 'guy', 'egotistical', 'ignoring', 'everyone', 'else', 'feelings', 'constant', 'attempts', 'turn', 'tides', 'fate', 'side', 'care', 'what', 'others', 'wanted', 'so', 'when', 'ACTUALLY', 'made', 'rain', 'episode', 'treated', 'good', 'thing', 'said', ""'m"", 'stupid', 'show', 'then', 'episode', 'ended', 'sort', 'cliffhanger', 'Ted', 'got', 'be', 'Robin', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'best', 'friend', 'Marshall', 'got', 'abandoned', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Lily', 'felt', 'really', 'sad', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'So', 'decided', 'give', 'second', 'season', 'go', 'least', 'see', 'was', 'justice', 'tables', 'turned', 'guy', 'who', 'really', 'deserved', 'be', 'happy', 'Marshall', 'got', 'happiness', 'something', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'happened', 'season', 'two', 'show', 'was', 'AMAZING', 'Everything', 'hated', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'gone', 'everything', 'liked', 'returned', 'droves', 'Ted', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'jackass', 'Robin', 'was', 'longer', 'useless', 'everone', 'showed', 'new', 'interesting', 'sides', 'Heck', 'even', 'stupid', 'rain', 'dance', 'scene', 'was', 'actually', 'retconned', 'be', 'just', 'coincidence', 'later', 'seasons', 'show', 'was', 'now', 'really', 'FUNNY', 'Season', 'one', 'had', 'laughs', 'here', 'there', 'rarely', 'anything', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'though', 'show', 'been', 'hilarious.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'else', 'whomever', 'wrote', 'realized', 'was', 'crap', 'decided', 'make', 'better', 'later', 'can', 'tell', 'season', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'non-stop', 'first', 'once', ""'m"", 'sixth', 'right', 'now', 'been', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'truly', 'deserving', '5-star', 'rating', 'So', 'say', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'first', 'season', 'intend', 'get', 'story', 'everything', 'becomes', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'later', 'worth', 'go', 'rough', 'start', 'order', 'get', 'next', 'impeccable', 'seasons']",How I Met Your Mother: Season 1

The premise of the show is of main character, Ted, who is recollecting and sharing stories to his kids on how he will eventually meet their mother.  So the year is actually 2030 but he is narrating the story on the adventures of when he was in his mid-twenties.Obviously, the meeting their mother part will never come until the series ends but so far, so good.  Each episode is another adventure on the mischievous times he had when he was in their mid-20's. Sharing his adventures are his two roommates, Marshall and Lily, best pal Barney and on and off again love interest, Robin.The setting is similar to NBC classic sitcom FRIENDS where there is a group that hang out too much at a local joint, in this case, a dive bar.  They are also living in NYC.

1016308,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000HT3P7E,Robert Moore,"[1, 2]","Every winter during the holiday hiatus when there are no new episodes being broadcast of any of my shows, I always try to knock off two or three shows that I've not seen but have had some curiosity about.  Now, I detest sitcoms.  Hate, hate, hate!  I loathe laugh tracks.  I consider them toxic and vile and completely destructive.  And in most cases I hate how stilted the sets are and how unimaginative the camera work is (no sitcom in the history of TV has had interesting camerawork, and I say that even though Karl Freund, one of the great geniuses in the history of cinematography, directed many episodes of I LOVE LUCY).  I watch a lot of TV, but I avoid sitcoms like I avoid infectious diseases.  I love comedy, mind you.  I love 30 ROCK, PARTY DOWN, THE OFFICE, and MODERN FAMILY, all of them comedies and none of them sitcoms, and all among my favorite shows.So why did I try HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER?  Mainly it was because I'd seen a number of TV critics who stated that it was a good show despite being a sitcom.  Part of it was Alyson Hannigan.  BUFFY is my all time favorite show and if you love BUFFY you love Willow.  Interestingly, I don't know a single person who watches the show (at least to my knowledge) and I pretty much decided to give it a shot despite the whole sitcom thing.  Surprisingly, I liked it.  A lot.  Not as much as 30 ROCK and PARTY DOWN and THE OFFICE and definitely not MODERN FAMILY (which might be the best new comedy since ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT), but it was still quite good, with an enormously likable small group of characters.  The laugh track is indeed irritating and, of course, completely unnecessary.  And what is more, it isn't a pure sitcom.  It does a surprising amount out-of-the-studio shooting (though on what anyone who is a serious fan of TV will recognize as the Warner Brothers urban lot, which has been used in hundreds of movies and TV series).  The street shots are on the precise same sets that were used for Metropolis in THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK and New Haven in THE GILMORE GIRLS and the area around the Pie Hole in PUSHING DAISIES.  Plus there are a surprising number of green screen shots.  So the show avoids the static feel that most three camera sitcoms have.  It isn't visually interesting, though it is less bland than, say, TWO AND A HALF MEN.  There are all kinds of ways that the show breaks established rules in minor ways.Despite the somewhat static visual dimension of the show and the nauseating laugh track, this is a pretty decent show and now that I'm caught up all the way through the first half of Season Five, I fully plan on continuing to watch in the future.  The two things that make the show work for me are the cast and the writing, which despite the well traveled genre.  I like that the cast consists of two unknowns (Josh Radnor and Cobie Smulders)at least at the start) to go with three well known actors (Hannigan, Neil Patrick Harris, and Jason Segal).  I love all five characters and they are all sensational individually but also tremendous as an ensemble.  And the writers manage to keep their stories interesting and ever new by a string of fascinating developments.  I am especially impressed by Neil Patrick Harris, who probably had his career set back by a decade by his Doogie Howser days.  (Which reminds me that another reason I took up the show was because of how much I enjoyed Harris in the title role of DR. HORRIBLE.)I'm still not a big fan of sitcoms and I doubt if I'll be adding many to my viewing roster in the future, but this is the big exception.  I think the show would have been greatly improved if they had tweaked it only slightly.  I know they have tied the show to stage sets to keep the budget down.  And the format means that the lack of visual experimentation means short set ups and keeps costs down.  The point is, I detest the genre, but I still like HIMYM.

I'd argue it is just behind The Office in quality.  I grew in the golden age (the '80s, not the '50s) of the sitcom.  As the years passed, good ones fell away, Seinfeld saved it for a while and it too moved off into the sunset.  I tend to love sitcoms with a bit whimsy, a bit of heart, and romance.  My all time standard is the Wonder Years.  While this is more ""sitcomy,"" it is more like a beautifully executed film.  Twenty-two (and this season is even better) episodes or 11 hours of a great romantic comedy.  Hollywood should take note.  The cast is pitch perfect.  All of them.  Neil patrick harris gets most of the press, but Josh Radnor is fantastic.  Colby Smulders is a great addition to the american comedy scene.  The rest?  Smashing.  They really don't come any better than this.  Take the time to fall in love.  Even with Bob Saget's voice.  This show is the best.

1016316,A37YE2WSA1GUOF,B000HT3P7E,Sean P. Pidgeon,"[4, 4]","Many people dread Mondays. It is the day you have to go begin getting up early again and go back to work, with a full five days ahead until relief. I don't really have much problem with Mondays. It's Sundays that I don't like (other than, of course it being the LORD's Day. That part of Sunday is always good. Keep the lightning bolts at bay, Yahweh!) On Sunday, you realize the weekend is almost over. What was supposed to be a relaxing, refreshing break from work almost never is. There is always something (family get-togethers, extended visits to watering holes) that does a double energy take-away. (1) You lose energy from being out and not getting sleep and rest. (2) You lose energy realizing that all the work you were planning on getting done for work Monday morning has not even been started and will not get done.Mondays are a cake-walk compared to Sundays. The work that had weighed on my mind on Sunday, I know on Monday is not that big of a deal. Happy Hour exists for Mondays just as much as Fridays, with the same beer specials and half priced appetizers that can be found at the end of the week. Best of all is the Monday T.V. programming on CBS.My three shows are How I Met Your Mother, The Class, and Two and A Half Men. How I Met Your Mother gets brownie points before seeing a single episode just for casting Bob Saget (who plays the effeminate Danny Tanner on Full House) and Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser from Doogie Howser and Neil Patrick Harris/Doogie Howser from Harold and Kumar go to White Castle). The premise of the show: Older Ted who we never see (voiced by Bob Saget), in the year 2030, is telling his teenage children the story of how he met their mother. The episodes consist of the Ted from 2006 and his buddies living as young mid to upper 20 something's figuring out their place in life. Presumably, the duration of the series will lead us to seeing who ends up being the woman that Ted settles down with.Our cast includes Ted, his best friend Marshall, Marshall's fianc&eacute;e Lily (played by Alyson Hannigan, who played Band Camp Girl Michelle in the American Pie movies), Ted's best female friend and Lily's best friend Robin, and, in my opinion, the star of the show, Ted's other best friend Barney (played by Mr. Doogie Howser himself, NPH). Marshall and Lily are the typical happy, in love couple, but they are really cool about it. They always hang out with their friends, and are not That PDA Couple who makes everyone else feel awkward and uncomfortable. Barney is the shameless rich playboy who has no qualms about being who he is, and makes the show always funny and entertaining. Robin is a local television anchor, really pretty, and really sweet. She is the perfect girl. Ted has had girlfriends, but just cannot seem to find the right relationship or the right girl. And, of course, Ted and Robin like each other as more than friends, everyone else can tell, but they will not tell each other. And, yeah, Ted does not know Robin likes him and Robin does not know Ted likes her.The story arc thus far has gone something like this: Marshall and Lily are working out living together and planning the wedding, but more important, serving as friends for Ted and Robin. Barney is the comic relief, and always keeps everyone loose. Near the beginning of the season, there is a wedding they all are attending. Barney goes alone (fear not! He never has to go home alone). Marshall and Lily go together. Ted does not have a date, so he asks Robin. At the last minute, she cancels because of a big opportunity to anchor the local news. So, Ted goes alone, where he meets a really great girl. Robin changes her mind, but shows up just in time to see that Ted has met a girl. A few episodes go by, and the new girl is in Germany, but still dating Ted. Ted is waiting for her to call but she hasn't yet, and he gets a call at 2 AM from Robin, who is sitting around, heartbroken, lonely, and she invited Ted over. ""Nothing good ever happens after 2 AM"" runs through his head, but he goes anyway. Ted finds out on the phone from Marshall and Lily that Robin really likes him, so he should not go over, but he does anyway. He tells Robin that he and his girlfriend broke up. They start making out, Ted feels guilty, so he goes to the bathroom to call his girlfriend and officially break up before doing anything with Robin, but he has taken Robin's phone by mistake. Robin answers Ted's phone, and gives Ted the phone with his girlfriend on it...Anyway, the question is up in the air whether Robin is going to be The One, or if the story is leading elsewhere. The show may seem chick flick-ish, but it resonates. We all have friends like Marshall and Lily, the happy couple. We also have friends like Barney, the guy who sleeps around a little too much, and is not afraid to brag about it, but is really a good guy who cares about his friends (even if that concern sometimes consists of ""I need to get you laid so you can forget that one who got away"").Wait a second! If you think about the show's premise, it is kind of creepy that Ted is telling his teenage children about his whole pre-meeting their mom sex life. There are some things people should just not tell their children. Oh well. It's just a show.",4,Nothing Good Happens after 2am,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,5254,"['Many', 'people', 'dread', 'Mondays', 'day', 'have', 'go', 'begin', 'getting', 'up', 'early', 'again', 'go',

1016318,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B000HT3P7E,Servo,"[1, 1]","As reality shows continue to flood the airwaves, seemingly crowding out traditional shows, every so often a fresh and inventive show comes along proving that when done right, the sitcom can still provide good comfort television. ""How I Met Your Mother"" is such a show. Created by Carter Bays & Craig Thomas, who (along with their band, The Solids) also performed the show's infectious theme song ""Hey Beautiful,"" HIMYM stars Josh Radnor as hopeless romantic architect Ted Mosby, who regales his kids (in 2030) with the ""legendary"" tales (told in flashbacks dating back to 2005) leading up to how he fell in love.Radnor, who I equate with Zach Braff's John Dorian character of NBC'sScrubs, really puts himself out there in the role of lovelorn Ted. Jason Segal and Alyson Hannigan are especially great as Ted's soon-to-be-married pals lawyer Marshall and teacher Lily, who as far as I'm concerned, rank as TV's most adorable couple. Cobie Smulders is just fine also as lovely TV news reporter Robin, who the gang playfully tease for being canadian and vice versa, plus the hilarious Neil Patrick Harris as ""suited up"" womanizer Barney. Only Harris could pull off this guy and make him somewhat likeable. One of my favorite exchanges between Barney and Lily is in ""Mary the Paralegal"" where Lily voices her disgust with Barney [for seemingly setting Ted up with a hooker] with ""Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low but sadly for you, it's just a new middle."" Instead of being offended, Barney proudly raises his chin and grins. Too funny.While the show hews pretty closely to the formulas ofFriends,Seinfeldand evenThe Wonder Years, How I Met Your Mother quickly formed its own rhythm, and in its own right is an original which I always look forward to watching. How I Met Your Mother - Season One is a 3-disc (482 min.) set featuring all 22 episodes from the 2005-2006 season; Full-Frame (1.33:1) video; 5.1 English Dolby surround; English, Spanish, French subtitles; Closed caption; plus extras. Housed in slim cases, Disc 1 contains: Episodes 1-8; Disc Two: 9-16; Disc Three: 17-22; The special features on the set are great, especially the commentaries by cast & crew which provide plenty of laughs and insight into the series.

It was the best show I ever seen, these characters who played in How I Met Your Mother are real people with real problems.  This show is compared to Cheers and the Wonder Years.  Difference between the Wonder Years and How I Met Your Mother, The Adult Kevin Arnold voiced by Daniel Stern tells the stories his early teen years from 12-16 from 1968-1973.  How I Met Your Mother tells the story about about fifty-something Ted Mosby voiced by Bob Saget tells the story about how he met his mother to his teenage kids and his adult years in 2006. Mostly the show revolves arounds five friends Ted Mosby, Marshall Eriksen, Lily Aldrin, Robin Scherbatsky and Barney Stinson.  It will ruin the show, it the Adult Ted Mosby doesn't reveal the mother.  When I look at Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky they're like the couple from the movie The Last Kiss Michael and Jenna.  Jenna who was having a baby girl with Michael and Michael is an architect trying to find his place.  Alyson Hannigan came from a long way from playing Willow Rosenberg and Michelle Flaherty in American Pie.  Some of her Buffy Alumni guest starred in how I met Your Mother, Alexis Denisof who played Sandy Rivers who always hitting on Robin, Amy Acker who plays Penelope the one who helps Ted make the rain dance and use to go out with Barney and Tom Lenk the nerdy coffee House guy who was hitting on Lily. I never have to worry about her being typecast. Alyson Hannigan has the greatest resemblance of Alias Star Jennifer Garner and Michelle Trachtenberg.  Tell you the truth, she ever played Agent Sydney Bristow from Alias, Elektra Natchios from Daredevil and Jenna Rink 13 Going on 30 she would have done it better.  Even Ben Affleck could mistake her for Jennifer Garner.  Josh Radnor looks like T.V.'s Ed Justin Long and Scrubs Zach Braff. Jason Segel has the greatest resemblance of Smallville's Tom Welling who played Clark Kent. Cobie Smulders has the greatest resemblance of Mission Impossible III's Michelle Monaghan who played Tom Cruise's fiance Julia Meade and Smallville's Kristin Kreuk who played Lana Lang.

1016323,A1H1DXHDZFR6EM,B000HT3P7E,Swamprat,"[3, 3]","How many TV comedies can be called ""Feel-Good"" shows? More and more comedy on network TV is about misery. Failure. The bitter, cynical realities that allegedly lurk behind the bright, shining happy endings we've all grown up with. The generation that created and continues to embrace Reality TV prefers to look at the lives of others and say ""Thank God that's not me"" than to look at the world through someone else's eyes and say ""Gee, I wish that could be me.""""How I Met Your Mother"" looks like a conventional sitcom with its multi-camera shooting style and it sounds like a conventional sitcom with its omnipresent laugh track. But there is nothing conventional about this show. Ted, Marshall and Lilly have been best friends since the first week of college. Now an architect, a law student and a kindergarten teacher respectively, their relationships haven't changed that much, with one notable exception. Marshall and Lilly are engaged and in the light of their wedding preparations, Ted starts to wonder if he's ready to settle down. Then he meets Robin, a beautiful, independent TV newscaster...who is completely wrong for Ted in every significant way. Add to the mix Barney, Ted's confirmed bachelor-for-life friend who insists that he is an expert on meeting, seducing and abandoning women. But throughout all the missteps and bad hookups one thing remains: Heart. It's a show about people who love each other and that makes all the difference.The cast includes popular favorites like Jason Segal (""Freaks and Geeks"", and the writer/star of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and Alyson Hannigan (Willow on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""). Barney is played by Neil Patrick Harris, and after seeing him in one scene, you won't even be thinking the word ""Doogie."" Also on board is Bob Saget (""Full House"") who narrates the show as Ted in the year 2030 telling his children the story of how he became the man he had to be before he could meet their mother. Now, it might seem like this gives away the ending of the story, but any true sports fan will tell you that there's more to a baseball game than who won and who lost. Life is a journey, not always an easy one, and this is a show that celebrates getting there as opposed to being there.",5,A 'Feel-Good' Sitcom,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,2237,"['How', 'many', 'TV', 'comedies', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'Feel-Good', 'More', 'more', 'comedy', 'network', 'TV', 'misery', 'Failure', 'bitter', 'cynical', 'realities', 'allegedly', 'lurk', 'bright', 'shining', 'happy', 'endings', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'generation', 'created', 'embrace', 'Reality', 'TV', 'prefers', 'look', 'lives', 'others', 'say', 'Thank', 'God', 'not', 'look', 'world', 'someone', 'else', 'eyes', 'say', 'Gee', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'conventional', 'sitcom', 'multi-camera', 'shooting', 'style', 'conventional', 'sitcom', 'omnipresent', 'laugh', 'track', 'nothing', 'conventional', 'show', 'Ted', 'Marshall', 'Lilly', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'first', 'week', 'college', 'Now', 'architect', 'law', 'student', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'respectively', 'relationships', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'that', 'much', 'one', 'notable', 'exception', 'Marshall', 'Lilly', 'are', 'engaged', 'light', 'wedding', 'preparations', 'Ted', 'wonder', 'ready', 'settle', 'down', 'Then', 'Robin', 'beautiful', 'independent', 'TV', 'newscaster', 'who', 'completely', 'wrong', 'Ted', 'significant', 'way', 'Add', 'mix', 'Barney', 'Ted', 'confirmed', 'bachelor-for-life', 'friend', 'who', 'expert', 'meeting', 'seducing', 'abandoning', 'women', 'missteps', 'bad', 'hookups', 'one', 'thing', 'Heart', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'difference.The', 'cast', 'popular', 'favorites', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'writer/star', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Willow', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Barney', 'played', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'seeing', 'one', 'scene', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'thinking', 'word', 'Doogie', 'Also', 'board', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'Full', 'House', 'who', 'show', 'Ted', 'year', '2030', 'telling', 'children', 'story', 'how', 'became', 'man', 'had', 'be', 'could', 'meet', 'mother', 'Now', 'might', 'seem', 'away', 'ending', 'story', 'true', 'sports', 'fan', 'will', 'tell', 'more', 'baseball', 'game', 'who', 'won', 'who', 'lost', 'Life', 'journey', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'one', 'show', 'getting', 'there', 'as', 'opposed', 'being', 'there']",How I Met Your Mother: Season 1

1016326,AKIV6FWJPWZ0Y,B000HT3P7E,"Tara Plumeri ""Snow Bunny""","[7, 8]","I think this show has a lot of potential to be a really good show. The cast is funny and endearing and the premise is fun.I missed the pilot and first few episodes. Finally I caught episode 5 (I think) and thought it was pretty funny. I think it has the potential to be great! Every character in the CBS show (5 in total) are likable but I must give extra kudos to the characters played by Alyson Hannigan (Lily), and Neil Patrick Harris (Barney). I may be biased towards my liking of Alyson Hannigan's Lily (due to her previous roles: American Pie Series, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but she brings a charm and charismatic flair to the show. Also Neil Patrick Harris' Barney is GREAT!!! He basically plays a creep which I'm sure everyone is familiar with (because I know I sure am!). I find Barney hilarious!!! He IS that creepy guy at the club but that's what makes him lovable.All in all this show has potential! As long as the stories, acting and writing keep up then I am definitely going to tune in! I think once people start getting to know the characters better, they'll start tuning in as well. Everyone always compares this show to ""Friends"" which didn't really get popular until after the first season. Hopefully, this show will continue to be funny and exceed our expectations.If anyone needs an episode list -- here it is --1.
