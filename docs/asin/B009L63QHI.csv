People often say they want their money back, I actually really do want my money back.Okay, first we have a cast filled with completely unlikable people. I wanted pretty much ALL of them to die. The only people I wanted to live were the ones that died. So that was annoying. The acting was NOT good. Not even almost good.They put pounds of dirt and make up on people who were just shoveling and doing minor tasks. Pretty much all the parents were abusive in disturbing ways and this is supposed to be a made for TV movie. The abuse was also stupid because they tried to make it WAY overly dramatic and when you couple that with horrible acting it just does not work. The abuse story lines don't even really have a resolution to it. And for some reason when 3 girls are trapped by the ghoul they just have to mention that he ""Did things"". All 3 of those girls were trapped together under ground and never bothered to try slipping through the giant holes they could have used to get out. And they never bothered kicking out the two thin boards nailed into the dirt keeping them there. They had to wait for a tiny kid to come by and pry the boards lose. The fake decor of the underground was worse than what you'd see in a soap opera.Things wrong with this movie:1. The plot2. The script3. The cast4. The acting5. The directing6. Being overly dramatic7. Having situation that don't even play out. Why put them there?8. Wimpy females9. Bad costumes and make up10. Bad sets11. Killing off the wrong people12. The endingThings good with this movie:1. It eventually ends.I like campy and cheesy movies. This is not that type. This is just really bad. It's like somebody in college put it together or something. Don't waste your money!",1,One of the worst movies ever made. Bad acting.

1597664,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B009L63QHI,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","A small town's secrets have been kept buried beneath Golgotha Cemetery, but three young boys mistakingly unleash it when digging a nearby fort in the coming-of-age Horror film, GHOUL. Adapted from the novel by Brian Keene, GHOUL focuses far more heavily on the inner struggles of its three male protagonists than the subterranean terror lurking beneath the cemetery. In many ways, the ghoul is more of a physical manifestation of the horrors experienced at home than anything else, and in defeating it, the boys learn to free themselves from their inner demons as they progress in to manhood. Unfortunately, the stronger story elements are overshadowed by a lackluster production. Let alone the continuing struggle with pacing, GHOUL is incredibly uneven, pairing the light mood of a childhood drama with the gory trappings of an adult monster movie. GHOUL becomes less accessible to younger audiences due to its darker themes as well, with child abuse and molestation being the true ""monsters"" of the picture. There is no discernible hero to be found either, and none of the performances stand out enough to elicit an emotional attachment to the characters. Try as it may, GHOUL is unable to dig up any interest in audiences young or old.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",2,Ghoul,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1270,"['small', 'town', 'secrets', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'buried', 'Golgotha', 'Cemetery', 'three', 'young', 'boys', 'mistakingly', 'unleash', 'when', 'digging', 'nearby', 'fort', 'coming-of-age', 'Horror', 'film', 'GHOUL', 'Adapted', 'novel', 'Brian', 'Keene', 'GHOUL', 'far', 'more', 'heavily', 'inner', 'struggles', 'three', 'male', 'protagonists', 'subterranean', 'terror', 'lurking', 'cemetery', 'many', 'ways', 'ghoul', 'more', 'physical', 'manifestation', 'horrors', 'experienced', 'home', 'anything', 'else', 'defeating', 'boys', 'learn', 'free', 'inner', 'demons', 'progress', 'manhood', 'Unfortunately', 'stronger', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'lackluster', 'production', 'Let', 'alone', 'continuing', 'struggle', 'pacing', 'GHOUL', 'incredibly', 'uneven', 'pairing', 'light', 'mood', 'childhood', 'drama', 'gory', 'trappings', 'adult', 'monster', 'movie', 'GHOUL', 'less', 'accessible', 'younger', 'audiences', 'due', 'darker', 'themes', 'as', 'well', 'child', 'abuse', 'molestation', 'being', 'true', 'monsters', 'picture', 'discernible', 'hero', 'be', 'found', 'either', 'none', 'performances', 'stand', 'out', 'enough', 'elicit', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'characters', 'Try', 'may', 'GHOUL', 'unable', 'dig', 'up', 'interest', 'audiences', 'young', 'old.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Ghoul

1597667,AWKRTLXGSNRES,B009L63QHI,"Donald C. Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[1, 3]","Chiller TV is a relatively new channel trying to make a name for itself--think very early SciFi (but not nearly as good).  It, too, has its premieres of movies and this happened to be one of them.  I did not read the book, so this review is based SOLELY on what I watched.The movie takes place in 1984.  Why?  Who knows; I guess that was a very good year for ghouls.  Seems Timmy (played by Modern Family's Nolan Gould) and his friends are busy...warding off beatings from fathers...and mothers, who take the phrase ""mommy loves you best"" to a new and sickening degree.  This is why I was shocked (and believe me it takes a LOT to shock me) when I viewed this movie.  First, there was no ghoul--not that I could tell anyway.  The only ghouls in here were the father who beat his son black and blue and the mother, who wanted to take showers with her 12-year old son; trouble is, mommy did not just stop at the showers and the network (who will not show an unedited movie) were fine with these two plot points.  Anyway, some girls disappear, and the boys try to rescue them (all the while avoiding mommy's amorous advances and daddy's beatings).Chiller TV should be ashamed of itself.  Although I savaged ""Hostel"" in my review, it was not one-tenth as vile of a movie as this was.  At least in ""Hostel,"" you knew ahead of time what to expect.  In this big, fat, overbloated t*rd, you did not.  It might be one thing to hint at incest, as well as a child who has a completely over-the-top father whose sole intent and mission in life is to beat on his son.  ""Ghoul"" takes TRASH to an all new level.  It was directed (*wink, *wink) by Gregory M. Wilson, who should be dragged publically and flogged afterwards.",1,Ghoulishly Awful,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,1707,"['Chiller', 'TV', 'relatively', 'new', 'channel', 'trying', 'make', 'name', 'think', 'very', 'early', 'SciFi', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'too', 'premieres', 'movies', 'happened', 'be', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'review', 'based', 'SOLELY', 'what', 'watched.The', 'movie', 'place', '1984', 'Why', 'Who', 'guess', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'year', 'ghouls', 'Timmy', 'played', 'Modern', 'Family', 'Nolan', 'Gould', 'friends', 'are', 'busy', 'warding', 'off', 'beatings', 'fathers', 'mothers', 'who', 'take', 'phrase', 'mommy', 'best', 'new', 'sickening', 'degree', 'why', 'was', 'shocked', 'believe', 'LOT', 'shock', 'when', 'viewed', 'movie', 'First', 'was', 'ghoul', 'not', 'could', 'tell', 'anyway', 'only', 'ghouls', 'here', 'were', 'father', 'who', 'beat', 'son', 'black', 'blue', 'mother', 'who', 'wanted', 'take', 'showers', '12-year', 'old', 'son', 'trouble', 'mommy', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'stop', 'showers', 'network', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'show', 'unedited', 'movie', 'were', 'fine', 'two', 'plot', 'points', 'Anyway', 'girls', 'disappear', 'boys', 'try', 'rescue', 'while', 'avoiding', 'mommy', 'amorous', 'advances', 'daddy', 'beatings', '.Chiller', 'TV', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'savaged', 'Hostel', 'review', 'was', 'not', 'one-tenth', 'vile', 'movie', 'was', 'least', 'Hostel', 'knew', 'ahead', 'time', 'what', 'expect', 'big', 'fat', 'overbloated', 't*rd', 'did', 'not', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'hint', 'incest', 'as', 'well', 'child', 'who', 'completely', 'over-the-top', 'father', 'sole', 'intent', 'mission', 'life', 'beat', 'son', 'Ghoul', 'TRASH', 'new', 'level', 'was', 'directed', '*wink', '*wink', 'Gregory', 'M.', 'Wilson', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'dragged', 'publically', 'flogged', 'afterwards']",Ghoul
1597668,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B009L63QHI,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 0]","As I read the synopsis for ""Ghoul,"" my expectations for a great film that would make me feel nostalgic about my childhood love for monster and action movies began to build up. High expectations aren't always a good thing when going into a film. Unfortunately, that was the case here. I wanted to like it, but something got lost along the way.Timmy, Doug, and Barry are the best of friends. As if life for three 12-year old boys at the edge of puberty isn't hard enough, things get very tough when they are forced by circumstances to confront the urban legend of a creature which lives underneath their local cemetery. Are there supernatural forces at work or are the disappearances of several local teenagers tied to someone in the town with unknown motives?I have to hand it to director Gregory M. Wilson and writer William M. Miller. This was made as a low-budget TV-movie for Chiller TV. As far as that goes, it looks great. The creature makeup is genuinely creepy and the sets look good.They never quite convinced me that I was watching something happening in 1984. The lack of a soundtrack effectively reflecting the era and misplaced pop-culture references were definite hindrances in the process. It didn't help when characters exclaimed, ""Eat my shorts"" and ""Don't have a cow!"" These two catchphrases were coined by Bart Simpson in ""The Simpsons,"" which didn't even gain real popularity until late 1989.""Ghoul"" boasts at least two veteran actors which are familiar to children of the 1980s. Barry Corbin portrays Timmy's grandfather. He was a supporting actor in several movies and TV shows from the decade like ""WarGames,"" ""Dallas,"" and ""Critters 2."" I'm sure tons of boys who were teenagers at the time will identify with my crush on Catherine Mary Stewart. I was captivated by her in such films as ""The Last Starfighter,"" ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" and ""Night of the Comet."" She plays Timmy's mother and adds a bit more legitimacy to the movie.One thing that gave me a sense of appreciation for ""Ghoul"" was the Behind-the-Scenes featurette. It did a great job of highlighting the hard work and conviction poured into the movie. It's hard to completely hate on something that someone put so much effort into. I have a deep respect for the set builders and makeup artists.""Ghoul"" tries very hard to capture the magic of films like ""Super 8,"" ""The Goonies,"" and ""The Monster Squad."" It's a shame it didn't accomplish what it set out to do successfully. Viewers who aren't looking for a walk down memory lane may enjoy this, but filmmakers missed their target market in my opinion.",2,"DVD Review: ""Ghoul""",1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,2584,"['read', 'synopsis', 'Ghoul', 'expectations', 'great', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'feel', 'nostalgic', 'childhood', 'love', 'monster', 'action', 'movies', 'began', 'build', 'up', 'High', 'expectations', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'going', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'case', 'here', 'wanted', 'like', 'something', 'got', 'lost', 'way.Timmy', 'Doug', 'Barry', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'life', 'three', '12-year', 'old', 'boys', 'edge', 'puberty', ""n't"", 'hard', 'enough', 'things', 'get', 'very', 'tough', 'when', 'are', 'forced', 'circumstances', 'confront', 'urban', 'legend', 'creature', 'local', 'cemetery', 'Are', 'there', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'work', 'are', 'disappearances', 'several', 'local', 'teenagers', 'tied', 'someone', 'town', 'unknown', 'motives', 'have', 'hand', 'director', 'Gregory', 'M.', 'Wilson', 'writer', 'William', 'M.', 'Miller', 'was', 'made', 'low-budget', 'TV-movie', 'Chiller', 'TV', 'As', 'far', 'great', 'creature', 'makeup', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'sets', 'look', 'good.They', 'never', 'quite', 'convinced', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'happening', '1984', 'lack', 'soundtrack', 'effectively', 'reflecting', 'era', 'misplaced', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'were', 'definite', 'hindrances', 'process', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'characters', 'exclaimed', 'Eat', 'shorts', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cow', 'two', 'catchphrases', 'were', 'coined', 'Bart', 'Simpson', 'Simpsons', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'gain', 'real', 'popularity', 'late', '1989', 'Ghoul', 'least', 'two', 'veteran', 'actors', 'are', 'familiar', 'children', '1980s', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'Timmy', 'grandfather', 'was', 'supporting', 'actor', 'several', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'decade', 'WarGames', 'Dallas', 'Critters', '2', ""'m"", 'sure', 'tons', 'boys', 'who', 'were', 'teenagers', 'time', 'will', 'identify', 'crush', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'was', 'captivated', 'such', 'films', 'Last', 'Starfighter', 'Weekend', 'Bernie', 'Night', 'Comet', 'Timmy', 'mother', 'bit', 'more', 'legitimacy', 'movie.One', 'thing', 'gave', 'sense', 'appreciation', 'Ghoul', 'was', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'featurette', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'highlighting', 'hard', 'work', 'conviction', 'poured', 'movie', 'hard', 'completely', 'hate', 'something', 'someone', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'have', 'deep', 'respect', 'set', 'builders', 'makeup', 'artists', 'Ghoul', 'very', 'hard', 'capture', 'magic', 'films', 'Super', '8', 'Goonies', 'Monster', 'Squad', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'accomplish', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'successfully', 'Viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'walk', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'may', 'enjoy', 'filmmakers', 'missed', 'target', 'market', 'opinion']",Ghoul
