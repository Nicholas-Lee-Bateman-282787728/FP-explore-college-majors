336804,A2IVCG4IILTY6O,6302801133,"abt1950 ""abt1950""","[4, 4]","""In a Lonely Place"" is usually considered a classic example of film noir, although-as other reviewers have pointed out-- it doesn't completely fit the mold.  It has much of the darkness and violence typical of the genre, but the main female character(Laurel Gray) is less a classic femme fatale than an ordinary woman who has fallen in love with the wrong man (Dixon Steele, a screen writer whose career is on the skids).  Although the background plot of the movie is about a murder investigation with the Steele as the prime suspect (he's innocent), its major focus is really on the man's  psychology and the negative impact of his violent streak on those around him.Bogart is perfect as Dixon Steele, the screen writer with what would now be called ""anger management problems.""  His screen presence oozes with the dangerousness that lies under his character's surface.  Gloria Grahame plays Laurel as a basically sweet women who finds herself increasingly uneasy and eventually terrified of her lover's potential for violence. The issue of domestic abuse is never explicitly raised, but it's implicit in Laurel's fear of Steele's dangerous side.  The tension builds, the relationship collapses, and in the bittersweet end, both lovers are left in a ""lonely place"" without each other.This film was based on a 1947 novel of the same name written by Dorothy Hughes.  The novel is a classic example of hard-boiled pulp fiction.  Dark as the movie is, the original novel is much darker.  In the film version, Steele is a deeply flawed man,  but one capable of love as well.  In the novel, he's a twisted serial killer with no redeeming features.  It's interesting to compare the book and the movie.  Even given Bogart's penchant for tough guy roles, it's easy to understand why so many changes were made.  Both versions are good, and both are concerned with the violent nature of the main character, but they're really two different works.  Watch one, read the other--and enjoy both.",4,"Dark, angry Bogart in a noir classic",1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,1980,"['Lonely', 'Place', 'usually', 'considered', 'classic', 'example', 'film', 'noir', 'although-as', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', ""n't"", 'completely', 'fit', 'mold', 'much', 'darkness', 'violence', 'typical', 'genre', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'Laurel', 'Gray', 'less', 'classic', 'femme', 'fatale', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'wrong', 'man', 'Dixon', 'Steele', 'screen', 'writer', 'career', 'skids', 'background', 'plot', 'movie', 'murder', 'investigation', 'Steele', 'prime', 'suspect', 'innocent', 'major', 'focus', 'really', 'man', 'psychology', 'negative', 'impact', 'violent', 'streak', 'him.Bogart', 'perfect', 'Dixon', 'Steele', 'screen', 'writer', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'be', 'called', 'anger', 'management', 'problems', 'screen', 'presence', 'dangerousness', 'character', 'surface', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'Laurel', 'basically', 'sweet', 'women', 'who', 'increasingly', 'uneasy', 'eventually', 'terrified', 'lover', 'potential', 'violence', 'issue', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'never', 'explicitly', 'raised', 'implicit', 'Laurel', 'fear', 'Steele', 'dangerous', 'side', 'tension', 'builds', 'relationship', 'bittersweet', 'end', 'lovers', 'are', 'left', 'lonely', 'place', 'other.This', 'film', 'was', 'based', '1947', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'Dorothy', 'Hughes', 'novel', 'classic', 'example', 'hard-boiled', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'Dark', 'movie', 'original', 'novel', 'much', 'darker', 'film', 'version', 'Steele', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'man', 'one', 'capable', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'novel', 'twisted', 'serial', 'killer', 'redeeming', 'interesting', 'compare', 'book', 'movie', 'Even', 'given', 'Bogart', 'penchant', 'tough', 'guy', 'roles', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'versions', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'concerned', 'violent', 'nature', 'main', 'character', ""'re"", 'really', 'two', 'different', 'works', 'Watch', 'one', 'read', 'other', 'enjoy']",In a Lonely Place VHS

Even though its a little known trip through the Film Noir world it offers so much more.  When ever I speak of Sunset Boulevard I have to mention In a Lonely Place because it attacks Hollwood witht the same dry and often harsh wit. At certain points this movie even outdoes Sunset Boulevard interms of pacing and dialogue. I always find myself sencond guessing on the sanity of Bogarts character. The flick offers up some Staples of Film Noir Grahame is brilliant and so is Lovejoy as his faithfuly committed best friend.  The story is built around Bogart's character obssesive nature towards his work and his underlying need for balance but in the world of noir the underlying tension of shady thoughts and desires always creep into the dark side of town. Grahame offers up so much unease and uncontrolled sexuality its never easy to root for her in this flick. The movie is dark as night, it offers up death,sex, happiness and sadism and a truly gut wrenching scene between Grahame and an all too eager and attentive stocky female masseuse.

336807,AGEIT17HENDIS,6302801133,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","I admit, admit up front, that I am partial to rugged windmill-chasing Humphrey Bogart roles like him as Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon trying to get a little rough justice in this wicked old world and not afraid to take a beating for the cause, or bust up some wrong gee dreams in the process (although admittedly getting a little thrown off the tracks by a whiff of Mary Astor's perfume, but that is to be expected). Or another windmill-chaser, Rick, in Casablanca when he knows, knows deep in his soul that the troubles of three love-stuck people in that wicked old World War II Nazi world didn't amount to a ""hill of beans"" against the darkening night (although there too he was thrown off by that damn dame perfume). And what about his role in To Have And Have Not when he is again forced, as Captain Harry Morgan, to step it up a notch in that still wicked old World War II world (that time, come to think of it, he too got thrown off the tracks  by a woman, by a whistler of all things).After that big manly, windmill-chasing build-up, complete with cigarette, unfiltered, of course, Luckies probably, in hand it is hard to see old Bogie as kind of troubled, well, dope. A guy who can't handle his emotions, or his fists, when some little breeze problem come s through the door. Against friend of foe, against some Johnny Rico or some frail. However that is exactly the problem before us as Bogie plays a troubled screen writer (aren't they all, troubled that is, having to write some pretty tough stuff to earn their dollar a word).Maybe I had better give you the ""skinny"" here so you'll get my drift. Dix (Bogie) is a maybe ""has been"" writer who is in a dry spell. He invites a hat- check girl from the club home (what club? any club, any gin joint in the world) to give him the story line of a book that he is supposed to do the screenplay for. And that is all he wants. (Ya, I know that ""come on"" is weak but there it is). The problem: early next morning she is found dead, very dead, in some arroyo road side ditch. And Dix is primo suspect numero uno. Enter one lovely blond alibi, Lauren (played by Gloria Grahame), who had seen Dix sent the hat check girl off alone. Dix is still not off the hook though since downtown (the cops, okay) are not convinced that Dix didn't do it. This unlikely pair begins an affair. The story then gets tense as Lauren (and others) begin to believe Dix did do it after he exhibited extreme anger (and violent acts) at the accusations.  Well, Dix didn't do it but he lost Laurel by his mad man American Psych 101 demeanor. And so he walks alone at the end, a contrite but broken man.See, no foggy airfield sent-offs amid the clamor of war next fights, no fast boat get-aways to Free French territory and the fight continues, and no wacko stuff of dreams busted wiser man here, just alone.

336809,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302801133,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Far and away my favorite Humphrey Bogart movie is the superb film noir, IN A LONELY PLACE (1950).Bogie is Dixon Steele, a brilliant screenwriter with an unpredictable violent temper who hasn't had a hit film in a decade. Assigned by a producer to transcribe a trash novel, Dix learns that the hatcheck girl at a restaurant where Hollywood insiders gather is familiar with the book, so he invites her home to tell him the story. The resulting interplay between them is the movie's only bit of humor (and it's deftly handled by both).After becoming annoyed with the girl's run-on description and mispronunciations, Steele wanders over to a window where he observes a negligee-clad woman (Gloria Grahame) who's watching him from a nearby apartment balcony; Dix closes the blinds. He sends the hatcheck girl off with $20 and instructs her to walk around the block to a taxi stand, then he goes to bed.Steele's awakened at 5 AM by a friend, Det. Sgt. Brub Nikolai (Frank Lovejoy), who wants him to come to HQ for questioning. Under grilling from Capt. Lochner (Carl Reid) Dix is nonchalant when he learns that the girl last seen with him has been found murdered-- tossed from a moving car ""like a cigarette."" The captain suspects Dix is the killer based on his uncaring manner and a long record of assaults (he even broke a producer's jaw).A witness is called in-- the woman on the balcony: Laurel Gray. She tells the police that she saw the dead girl leave Steele's apartment ALONE-- a lie, as he'd closed the blinds. Released from further questioning, a grateful Dix gives Laurel a ride home. This unusual way of being thrown together leads to the inevitable-- the two fall deeply in love.Laurel is brought back to police HQ for further questions; Capt. Lochner tells her of his suspicions and warns her to be careful. Steele's later violent explosions make Laurel begin to wonder if maybe her lover DID kill the hatcheck girl?Bogart and Grahame are absolutely brilliant in this movie. They both display so many emotions: passion, fear, longing, anger, joy, vulnerability, impatience, paranoia, confusion. If you haven't yet experienced ""In a Lonely Place,"" don't hesitate-- it's a truly great picture!""In a Lonely Place"" is also available onDVD.Bogart's next project, THE ENFORCER (1951), was loosely based on the Murder Inc. story.

For many of the actors and actresses, it takes a bit of energy to be motivated to watch their films, but with Bogart, it's not a problem. I knew with him the film was bound to be good, and it was the case with In a Lonely Place. As often the female co-star is changed when paired up with Bogart, this time it is Gloria Grahame who steps up to the plate and matches him scene for scene. The results are terrific. There is a good deal of Hitchcock's Suspicion about In a Lonely Place. Of course, Bogart wins the show because he is that good. A good deal of credit goes to Nicholas Ray for his fine direction, the kind of a film that's a lost art nowadays. Obviously, whatever Bogart did for acting is a lost art too.

He's not all that handsome (we're talking in the movies, after all; this was 1950), no Johnny Depp for looks or style. But he's intense. Man oh man, is he intense.I can't help using the present tense about this movie, even though it is over 60 years old. I was three when it was made. But it is the sort of movie that puts the audience right into the middle, feeling everything the characters feel.Bogart is Dixon Steele, a screenwriter who hasn't had a hit for awhile. In fact, his last movie was a flop. So he's given a tacky little nothing book and told to write a screenplay that is faithful to the book. But he asks the hatcheck girl at his friend's restaurant, who has read it, to tell him the story so he doesn't have to. She complies, mispronouncing lots of words and bubbling with enthusiasm for what is clearly a very mediocre story. He thanks her, gives her money for taxi fare, and she goes home.Or so he thought. Early the next morning he gets rousted out by his friend, a cop, who takes him down town to his boss, because the hatcheck girl was murdered during the night.But this is not really a murder mystery movie. This is a drama about love and trust, and I won't spoil it by telling you any more than that. It's a suspense, but the audience is not focused on the investigation of the murder. My focus was, as it was intended to be, on the romance between Steele and his neighbor. And I loved watching it grow and then die, as suspicion and distrust ruined it.Four stars.

Perhaps it's just that most movies in the 1950s were not much cop. You couldn't really call them good, let alone great. In this one the scaffolding supporting Bogart's performance as Dixon Steele (what a phony name) is quite mediocre, scarcely up to B-movie standard. The script is clunky, the dialogue poor, the second-string acting, especially the completely wooden cops and the ridiculous and permanently drunk thespian, downright ordinary, and the shooting just isn't anything to write home about, in spite of Curtis Hanson's panegyric. However, Bogart's performance is compelling, like Dean's in Rebel. There's something accurate and genuine about his psychology, and the feeling comes across as unusually real. I've known people precisely like this: their own worst enemies; strong tendencies to violence combined with ultra-sensitivity, almost paranoia, whose bizarre behaviour invites suspicion, even though they haven't done anything wrong. Something to do with an extreme egocentricity, and an inability to see things as others see them. This personality dysfunction may also be linked to a certain kind of creativity, but a basically second-rate kind. Bogart carries the story, which is otherwise presented in a very pedestrian and unsubtle manner. In one or two scenes Gloria Grahame just about matches him; although I frankly could never take to her. She always seemed to me highly unattractive-looking, unsexy, and I could never figure out why she got so many high-profile parts. There's no mystery to the plot. In fact, there's no plot at all: the whole thing is a character-study; and there's not one ray of hope for this particular character. Very depressing.",3,Clumsy.

336813,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6302801133,Bomojaz,"[0, 0]","Excellent firm noir entry starring Humphrey Bogart in one of his best performances. Bogie plays Dixon Steele, a screenwriter trying to make a comeback after the war - and after he's distanced himself from the studio heads with his erratic and violent behavior. He finally gets a break and is asked to adapt a romance novel for the screen; he hates the book and tells off the producer, slugging him. A hatcheck girl (played by Martha Stewart) at Bogie's club hangout offers to help Bogart out with the book and goes home with him. Later Stewart is found dead and Bogie is the prime suspect. But neighbor Gloria Grahame, who falls in love with Bogie, has seen Stewart leave his place alone the night she was killed - yet she's also witnessed his violent tantrums and soon doesn't know what to think. And that's the beauty of the picture as director Nicholas Ray develops the story so that we, the audience, soon don't know what to think, either. Our emotions sway back and forth over Bogart's guilt right to the end. The script is taut and powerful, and all the principal actors put in excellent performances.

Movie screen-writer Dixon Steele  retorts:  ""When they get to be big stars, they usually do"". This 2003 DVD was quietly released in 2003, without any fanfare. There should have been some.  Nicholas Ray's powerful direction of 1950's ""In A Lonely Place"" is a gaunt inspection of ""inside Hollywood"", complete with ruthless studio bosses, boozy actors on-the-skids, and one motion picture screen-writer who's fed up with it all.  Dixon Steele meets a young girl at his favorite restaurant, and invites her home to read a story he's considering adapting for a movie. The girl is pretty, but it's just business to him.  She's seen leaving his Hollywood apartment by his quiet neighbor, Laurel.  When the girl is found murdered the next day, the police naturally want to talk to the bad-tempered, wild-living Dixon Steele. Did he fly-off-the-handle again, and knock off the girl?  Humphrey Bogart stars as Dixon Steele.  Flush from success in the late 1940's, Bogart had set-up his own film production company, Santana Productions, and was releasing movies through Columbia. In this period, Santana made three films in a row.  Two were real stinkers, but ""In A Lonely Place"" is now film classic.  Humphrey Bogart, still in his prime, had perhaps the role of a lifetime. Yes, he was great in ""Casablanca"", but here, as Steele, nothing is held back. Like Bogart himself, the character of Steele is acerbic, raw, and violent.  A brawler in real life, Bogart wasn't afraid to illuminate his darker side in a gutsy portrayal of a neurotic, almost psychotic reprobate.  Ray's direction is flawless, and this is his finest work(It's even better than his marvelous ""Rebel Without A Cause"").  His wife(at the time) Gloria Grahame co-stars as Laurel, the neighbor.  A fine cast includes Robert Warwick, Frank Lovejoy, Morris Ankrum, Myron Healey, and in a small part, Jack Webb. The DVD is spotless, with a Dolby Digital 2.0 track. Extras include ""In A Lonely Place Revisited"", a featurette on restoration, and a Bogart photo montage. Just a few years later, Bogart's health would decline, and meaty roles would become somewhat rare.  But here, just before that happened, is an electrifying performance by a motion picture icon at the top of his game.  A quality DVD,a great story, and amazing multi-level theater.

336815,A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K,6302801133,"brewster22 ""brewster22""","[17, 17]","&quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; is widely considered to be one of the best of the film noir genre, but I can't quite bring myself to give it noir status.  It certainly has the ambiguity, sense of paranoia and seedy underworld setting of the standard noir, but it's also lacking in a few crucial elements that in my opinion give a film noir its noir: the femme fatale, the sense of underlying corruption. When Gloria Grahame first slinks her away across the screen, you think &quot;Ah ha! Here's our femme fatale.&quot; But she's not, and this is only one instance of the way this film unpredictably turns the audience's expectations upside down.The film is very unusual in the way it tells its story.  Bogart plays a struggling screen writer suspected of murdering a young, star-struck girl.  We know he hasn't done it, and we expect the film to be about the unraveling of the mystery surrounding her death in Bogie's attempts to prove his innocence.  But that's not at all what we get.  The murder is forgotten, never very important to begin with, and the film settles into a character study of Bogie, not concerned so much with whether or not he committed a murder but rather with whether or not he has the CAPACITY to commit murder. The cool, unflappable persona that greets us at the beginning of the movie (the Bogie we're used to), deteriorates into a paranoid, jealous, nearly psychotic loner by the film's end, and Gloria Grahame (who we early on suspected of having some devious aims) becomes our chief object of concern.  The movie is all over the place in a good way, truly surprising and fresh.The title of course refers to the lonely place of the interior psyche, and the demons that can haunt a man who has too much time with himself.  Bogie spends so much time in the imaginary worlds he creates for his screenplays, that he can't seem to deal any longer with the reality of the material world around him, or maintain relationships that don't rely on his bullying his way into getting what he wants.  And the saddest thing is that he knows this about himself.  It's a great display of acting on Bogie's part and a neat deconstruction of the Bogie screen persona.Enjoy.Grade: A-",4,An Unpredictable Pseudo-Noir,1074729600,"01 22, 2004",2004,2190,"['quot', 'Lonely', 'Place', 'quot', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'noir', 'genre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bring', 'give', 'noir', 'status', 'certainly', 'ambiguity', 'sense', 'paranoia', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'setting', 'standard', 'noir', 'also', 'lacking', 'few', 'crucial', 'elements', 'opinion', 'give', 'film', 'noir', 'femme', 'fatale', 'sense', 'underlying', 'corruption', 'When', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'first', 'away', 'screen', 'think', 'quot', 'Ah', 'ha', 'Here', 'femme', 'fatale.', 'quot', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'instance', 'way', 'film', 'unpredictably', 'audience', 'expectations', 'down.The', 'film', 'very', 'unusual', 'way', 'story', 'Bogart', 'struggling', 'screen', 'writer', 'suspected', 'murdering', 'young', 'star-struck', 'girl', 'know', ""n't"", 'done', 'expect', 'film', 'be', 'unraveling', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'death', 'Bogie', 'attempts', 'prove', 'innocence', 'not', 'what', 'get', 'murder', 'forgotten', 'never', 'very', 'important', 'begin', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'Bogie', 'not', 'concerned', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'committed', 'murder', 'rather', 'not', 'CAPACITY', 'commit', 'murder', 'cool', 'unflappable', 'persona', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Bogie', ""'re"", 'used', 'paranoid', 'jealous', 'nearly', 'psychotic', 'loner', 'film', 'end', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'who', 'early', 'suspected', 'having', 'devious', 'aims', 'chief', 'object', 'concern', 'movie', 'place', 'good', 'way', 'truly', 'surprising', 'fresh.The', 'title', 'course', 'refers', 'lonely', 'place', 'interior', 'psyche', 'demons', 'can', 'haunt', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Bogie', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'imaginary', 'worlds', 'screenplays', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'deal', 'longer', 'reality', 'material', 'world', 'maintain', 'relationships', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'bullying', 'way', 'getting', 'what', 'saddest', 'thing', 'great', 'display', 'acting', 'Bogie', 'part', 'neat', 'deconstruction', 'Bogie', 'screen', 'persona.Enjoy.Grade', 'A-']",In a Lonely Place VHS

He also has a quick temper and a paranoia complex. He picks fights with people over the most routine matters and these fights commonly come to blows. He is indeed ""in a lonely place"" of his own making. Steele has a chance to write a screenplay based on a book, but the author wants him to read the book and give him his opinion in just a matter of a few days. At the restaurant where Steele has talked with the author, the hat check girl says she has just read the book and loves it. Steele invites her to come over to his apartment and tell him about the book to save him the trouble of reading it. This is all very innocent in what Steele intends and in what actually happens. In fact, Steele's reaction, unseen and unheard by the hat check girl, to her semi-literate oral book report is wickedly funny. After the girl tells her story, she leaves. Neighbor Laurel Grey (Gloria Grahame) sees her leave. However, the next day, the girl's strangled body is found next to a road. The police quickly find their way back to Steele's place where, due to his violent nature and nonchalant reaction to the murder, he is under immediate suspicion. He finds an alibi in his neighbor Laurel, and this is how they formally meet.Almost immediately the two begin a relationship that gets serious fast. Laurel finds Steele attentive and interesting. Thus at first Laurel thinks Steele is innocent of the murder, but one by one her doubts grow. Steele explodes over little things, even eventually punching out his own agent over nothing. In fact, Steele's agent is his only real friend and actually is a bit of an enabler for his bad behavior. You always see Steele show his idea of remorse for his actions, even anonymously sending money to a guy he has beaten up over a traffic accident. However, the question that is left to be answered is - exactly what is going on with this guy? Could he have stalked and killed the girl over his anger at something else or someone else entirely? And if he didn't kill the hat check girl, will he eventually kill someone else? Laurel is asking these same questions as she begins to wonder - is it more dangerous to try and run away from Steele, or is it more dangerous to stay? One should never consider saying ""yes"" to a marriage proposal if it comes down to what is less dangerous.Laurel is not exactly a finished book herself. Apparently she had a serious relationship with a well-off man just prior to this, and ended it for really no tangible reason. Then there is a kind of g ay subtext going on between herself and her masseuse Martha. They only have one scene together but it certainly throws out more questions than answers, just like the rest of this film.If you like noir, if you like Bogart, if you like being challenged, watch this film.",5,One of Bogart's most complex roles,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,2975,"['was', 'very', 'interesting', 'role', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'was', 'bit', 'production', 'code', 'buster', 'several', 'levels.Bogart', 'plays', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'Dixon', 'Steele', 'who', 'somewhat', 'writing', 'rut', 'also', 'quick', 'temper', 'paranoia', 'complex', 'fights', 'people', 'most', 'routine', 'matters', 'fights', 'commonly', 'come', 'blows', 'indeed', 'lonely', 'place', 'own', 'making', 'Steele', 'chance', 'write', 'screenplay', 'based', 'book', 'author', 'read', 'book', 'give', 'opinion', 'just', 'matter', 'few', 'days', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Steele', 'talked', 'author', 'hat', 'check', 'girl', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'Steele', 'come', 'apartment', 'tell', 'book', 'save', 'trouble', 'reading', 'very', 'innocent', 'what', 'Steele', 'what', 'actually', 'fact', 'Steele', 'reaction', 'unseen', 'unheard', 'hat', 'check', 'girl', 'semi-literate', 'oral', 'book', 'report', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'girl', 'story', 'Neighbor', 'Laurel', 'Grey', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'leave', 'However', 'next', 'day', 'girl', 'strangled', 'body', 'found', 'road', 'police', 'quickly', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'Steele', 'place', 'where', 'due', 'violent', 'nature', 'nonchalant', 'reaction', 'murder', 'immediate', 'suspicion', 'alibi', 'neighbor', 'Laurel', 'how', 'formally', 'meet.Almost', 'immediately', 'two', 'begin', 'relationship', 'serious', 'fast', 'Laurel', 'Steele', 'attentive', 'interesting', 'Thus', 'first', 'Laurel', 'thinks', 'Steele', 'innocent', 'murder', 'one', 'one', 'doubts', 'grow', 'Steele', 'over', 'little', 'things', 'even', 'eventually', 'punching', 'out', 'own', 'agent', 'nothing', 'fact', 'Steele', 'agent', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'actually', 'bit', 'enabler', 'bad', 'behavior', 'always', 'see', 'Steele', 'show', 'idea', 'remorse', 'actions', 'even', 'anonymously', 'sending', 'money', 'guy', 'beaten', 'up', 'traffic', 'accident', 'However', 'question', 'left', 'be', 'answered', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'guy', 'Could', 'have', 'stalked', 'killed', 'girl', 'anger', 'something', 'else', 'someone', 'else', 'entirely', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'hat', 'check', 'girl', 'will', 'eventually', 'kill', 'someone', 'else', 'Laurel', 'asking', 'same', 'questions', 'wonder', 'more', 'dangerous', 'try', 'run', 'away', 'Steele', 'more', 'dangerous', 'stay', 'One', 'should', 'never', 'consider', 'saying', 'yes', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'down', 'what', 'less', 'dangerous.Laurel', 'not', 'exactly', 'finished', 'book', 'Apparently', 'had', 'serious', 'relationship', 'well-off', 'man', 'just', 'prior', 'ended', 'really', 'tangible', 'reason', 'Then', 'kind', 'g', 'ay', 'subtext', 'going', 'herself', 'masseuse', 'Martha', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'scene', 'together', 'certainly', 'out', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'just', 'rest', 'film.If', 'noir', 'like', 'Bogart', 'like', 'being', 'challenged', 'watch', 'film']",In a Lonely Place VHS

The narrative rises to a promising start with a mysterious murder to which Bogart seems marginally linked, but then the story wanes straightaway into a muddled exploration of his erratic behavior.  And given the shaky, shifty ground on which psychology now rests, this study looks like primeval ooze!  Is Bogie mentally deranged, artistically tempermental, viciously manipulative, or what?  There's never a clear answer, and, given forties/fifties chauvinism, Grahame apparently assumes it's okay if her man roughs up women or bops proteges-- just as long as he's not capable of murder!  And there's nothing in the plotline to elucidate her motivations or calculations.  There are so many sinkholes in the story that the film seems clumsily overedited.  When Bogart and Grahame first meet, they almost immediately make moon-eyes.  Next, they're viewed in a writer/secretary relationship that appears almost chaste.

His portrayal of a WWII veteran returned to his career as a Hollywood screenwriter is poignant and sad in some ways, because it subtly pictures the life of a talented man whose life was interrupted by his service in a horrifying war.  As the movie develops, viewers learn that the character, bravery, and loyalty of Bogart's on-screen character shown through in wartime, but these traits had little value as he tried to readjust to civilian life in a world of egos and make believe that is the Hollywood movie industry.  ""In a Lonely Place"" could not be made in today's world of political correctness where tales of individual lives must carry some overt indictment of world and political systems, and deep rooted inner conflicts are handily classified under lay psychiatric terms like ""anger management"" problems, without analysis of underlying causes.The action in this movie is intimately personal, the relationship between Bogart's character and that of Grahame's character is both passionate and tense.  The love story portrayed is that of an older man with one last chance at creativity sparked by the inspirational love of a younger woman, sort of a 1940s lite version of Henry Miller's relationship with Brenda Venus.

336824,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6302801133,Douglas Doepke,"[3, 4]","Bogart reportedly thought the movie a failure. Certainly box-office results were dismal and Bogie's production company, Santana, lost a bundle. Hard to believe anyone thought this disturbing film with its downbeat ending would actually make money. Bogart's Dix Steel (that name should have been reconsidered) is a borderline psychopath, a Jekyll and Hyde who can boil over in an instant. He's a walking volcano whose sensitive side simply cannot contain the inner turmoil. In that day, few Hollywood egos had the assurance to take on such an unflattering role, especially the shadowy later scenes where his creviced face approaches the grotesque. It's a fine and daring performance, and the last, I believe, where Bogart plays even a semi- romantic leading man.Good as Bogart is, this is a Gloria Graham showcase. Her droopy upper lip and pouty face never quite fit the Hollywood mold, and by decade's end, she was gone. Here, however, she's near perfect as the jaded starlet, with a questionable background and just a hint of 50's kink. Her Laurel Gray emerges as a vulnerable, yet street-wise toughie, drawing the eager Steel into a torrid affair, (only hinted at because of the production code of the day). But as his character unravels, so must hers, which it does in beautifully understated stages. Watch her quietly desperate reaction to Steel following the assault on the motorist, or her barely controlled panic at film's end. It's an award-level performance, all the better for refusing to go over the top, despite the many opportunities. Small wonder she remains an enduring noir favorite.The mystery angle may be a clever plot device, but it's director Nicholas Ray's powerful vision that makes the film gel. A poet of post-war alienation, he's the perfect overseer of such fare, combining the elements into a grimly compelling view of human estrangement and isolation. Perhaps no director other than Elia Kazan could work with a cast as effectively as Ray. Notice how distinctively each of the supporting players is drawn, from the Shakespearean drunk to the hard-bitten maid to the lounge lizards at Romanoff's. Only the cops in routine roles seem to fade into the background. Unerrated in many of Ray's best films is the scoring, and this film is no exception. George Antheil's compositions are simple yet expertly conceived, highlighting the scenes without rivaling them and lending just the right emotional tone. My one complaint: I've never understood why an industry so close to the beach couldn't film at the beach, or at least couldn't have come up with a better process shot than the one here.Nonetheless Bogart was wrong. The film is anything but a failure. Coming from an era of happy endings, Dix and Laurel remain star-crossed lovers, doomed by their own sophistication and inner demons, for which there appears no cure. Expecting uplift, audiences of the day may not have responded, but viewers during the years between have, recognizing In a Lonely Place for the noir classic it is. This quietly disturbing portrayal of one man's inability to cope continues to resonate beyond the confines of today's slam-bang world.

336825,AJLW1DZSHOVGW,6302801133,"Elaine Campbell ""Desert Dweller""","[52, 54]","Filmed in 1950, this film is brilliantly directed by Nicholas Ray.  Its production company, Santana Productions, was Bogart's own (Santana was the name of his yawl), which he started in 1948 and sold to Columbia Pictures in 1954, the problem being that his company simply couldn't outbid the large studios for properties he wanted, i.e., Dead End and The Detective Story (some of Santana's films included Knock on Any Door, Tokyo Joe and Sirocco, which Bogart himself called ""a stinker"").Eric Lax, the definitive biographer of Humphrey Bogart, believes that he was drawn to this role because he could so closely identify with the character's inner turmoil, problems with women, and a rocky relationship with the ups and downs of the film industry itself.  The character he plays is also a heavy drinker.  Perhaps because of the similarities, and because Bogart was so greatly talented, his performance in this film leaves one in awe.  It is wide and deep, cruel and unbelievably tender, and very, very moving.  Gloria Grahame gives unquestionably the best performance of her career.  The role was to go to Lauren Bacall, but Warner Brothers refused to lend her to Santana Productions for the film.  Though I admire Bacall's early work, I am glad we got Grahame with her flower-like fragility.It is a murder mystery, but more it is an in-depth character study and even a life study.  Dix (Bogart's character) is full of rage which he has for years refused to confront.  Laurel (Grahame's character) is lost.  Both her film career and her search for a meaningful love are illusive at best.  They genuinely fall deeply in love.  Was she not strong enough?  Was he not brave enough?  We see what could have been, and are left with what will never be.My great compliments to Art Smith, whom I consider to be the greatest character actor of his time (he played the psychiatrist in Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid, one of William Powell's later films).  The scene in which he is violated is a great moment in film.Hats off to a deeply moving film, brutally honest and perfectly executed, each performance being a gem of its own.",5,A DEEPLY MOVING FILM!,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,2117,"['Filmed', '1950', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'production', 'company', 'Santana', 'Productions', 'was', 'Bogart', 'own', 'Santana', 'was', 'name', 'yawl', 'started', '1948', 'sold', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', '1954', 'problem', 'being', 'company', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'outbid', 'large', 'studios', 'properties', 'wanted', 'i.e.', 'Dead', 'End', 'Detective', 'Story', 'Santana', 'films', 'included', 'Knock', 'Any', 'Door', 'Tokyo', 'Joe', 'Sirocco', 'Bogart', 'called', 'stinker', '.Eric', 'Lax', 'definitive', 'biographer', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'was', 'drawn', 'role', 'could', 'so', 'closely', 'identify', 'character', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'problems', 'women', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'ups', 'downs', 'film', 'industry', 'character', 'also', 'heavy', 'drinker', 'Perhaps', 'similarities', 'Bogart', 'was', 'so', 'greatly', 'talented', 'performance', 'film', 'one', 'awe', 'wide', 'deep', 'cruel', 'unbelievably', 'tender', 'very', 'very', 'moving', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'unquestionably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'role', 'was', 'go', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'refused', 'lend', 'Santana', 'Productions', 'film', 'admire', 'early', 'work', 'am', 'glad', 'got', 'Grahame', 'flower-like', 'fragility.It', 'murder', 'mystery', 'more', 'in-depth', 'character', 'study', 'even', 'life', 'study', 'Dix', 'Bogart', 'character', 'full', 'rage', 'years', 'refused', 'confront', 'Laurel', 'Grahame', 'character', 'lost', 'film', 'career', 'search', 'meaningful', 'love', 'are', 'illusive', 'best', 'genuinely', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love', 'Was', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'Was', 'not', 'brave', 'enough', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'left', 'what', 'will', 'never', 'be.My', 'great', 'compliments', 'Art', 'Smith', 'whom', 'consider', 'be', 'greatest', 'character', 'actor', 'time', 'played', 'psychiatrist', 'Mr.', 'Peabody', 'Mermaid', 'one', 'William', 'Powell', 'later', 'films', 'scene', 'violated', 'great', 'moment', 'film.Hats', 'deeply', 'moving', 'film', 'brutally', 'honest', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'performance', 'being', 'gem', 'own']",In a Lonely Place VHS
336826,A3L31489BCB1D7,6302801133,El Kabong,"[129, 135]","For all the praise film-noir is lavished with (quite a lot of it valid), the majority of it relies on convention as much as the standard white-picket-fence, happy-ending 'family' film does: just invert the cliches and bathe them in deep-focus shadows. While this movie, on its surface, resembles the classic-style film noir of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, beneath the surface it's a whole different animal. No calculating evil females or tough guys masking hearts of gold populate IN A LONELY PLACE. It's a much more wrenching and powerfully disturbing film because the murder that draws the protagonists together turns out to be of peripheral importance, while the love story between Humphrey Bogart's troubled screenwriter and Gloria Grahame's B-actress spins inexorably towards damnation completely on its own power. The basic story has him a suspect in a killing, and her in love with him yet unsure of his innocence, but director Nicholas Ray stages the proceedings so that WE see it's not the murder that disturbs her but her own conviction that his self-destructive and volatile nature will destroy them both. To his credit, Ray never takes the easy way out of having Bogart turn monster on her. You care inordinately about the characters, hoping hard (as Bogart's agent does in the film) that some transforming moment will come that will spare these people and allow their deeply felt love to flourish and heal them both - even as the evidence before your own eyes tells you there ain't no way. For 1950 -hell, for any year- such an unsentimental and uncompromising treatment of a tragic adult relationship is a rarity. The shadows suffusing this excellent film come not from UFA-influenced lighting but from the Black Dahlia murder, the HUAC hearings, the death throes of old Hollywood & the moral and spiritual detachment of postwar American life. But most of all, they're projected from within the characters themselves. Grahame and Ray's own real-life deteriorating relationship formed the template for the doomed lovers, and for them, this film is an act of great courage. For his part, Bogart (the star and executive producer) takes elements of all his previous romantic loners and blends them with the harsh, sour pigments of Fred C Dobbs, running the risk of audience rejection. His performance is unflinchingly honest, among his best work ever.

336829,A7Y6AVS576M03,6302801133,gobirds2,"[7, 10]","IN A LONELY PLACE is a brilliant film from director Nicholas Ray. Humphrey Bogart with his usual cragged-faced presence dominates the screen once again. This time he is a man totally introverted and obsessed with some hidden lack of ability to express his own compassion and humanity. Bogart plays an elusive Hollywood screenwriter named Dixon Steele that becomes the focus of a police investigation of a murder in this atmospheric and unsettling film. What makes the film so unsettling is Bogart's performance. He is a very enigmatic, private and tired man who at times seems so detached from reality that it is frightening. Yet Bogart in this role still posses a virile and cynical coolness of style that is so appealing and it is one that only he can pull off with his screen charisma bringing this character to reality and believability.In the film Bogart lives in a complex of courtyard apartments. The police investigation interferes with a relationship that Bogart has with Gloria Grahame who lives in the same complex. Bogart comes to be intrigued (and visa versa) by her and truly falls in love with her. Yet it is the police investigation that continues to intensify Bogart's inner struggle as a human being with his need to love and be loved and escalates his volatile and violent outbursts which confuse and distance Grahame from him.IN A LONELY PLACE examines such human qualities and frailties of love, trust and loyalty. It explores and exposes the effects of our interpretations, perceptions and misconceptions and ultimately demonstrates that our own human flaws can lead to perpetual loneliness of the heart if left unchecked.

The tenth time I found the initial scene between Ms Grahame and her lesbian masseur both witty and gripping as the almost sadistic masseur twisted, leant, squeezed with each vicious word her distaste for Ms Grahame's man, and I guess, for all men.  But this is a film rich in such moments - including the apparently obligatory night club singing scene which was a cliche of the forties films - with the excellent singing performance interrupted by the enraged Dixon Steele (Bogart) as he physically attacks HIS BESPECTACLED BEST FRIEND AND AGENT at his table.  Personally I find this film superior to REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  It is especially well written by Andrew Solt and Mr Ray gets fabulous performances out of all concerned.  It is at the one time a film self deprecating about its own medium as an art - much irony within the film about the cliches of film - as well as a searing comment on post traumatic stress as the character played by Mr Bogart is clearly a victim of war.

Adapted from a pulp novel about a serial killer, the film veers widely from its original source: the murder mystery that sets it off fades very quickly to the background, as the film becomes much more about the volatile relationship between the abusive but romantic screenwriter played by Bogart and the woman he loves (Gloria Grahame, in a very fine performance that makes much of her odd combination of flowerlike beauty and tough will). The film's searching exploration of raw emotions combined with its complex use of mise-en-scene only partially obscures the fact that Bogart's performance is quite erratic. Although believably incensed in the final scene, he seems too bored and tired to  be credible driving his car at high speed in a fury or beating up a star football player. Moreover, the initial scenes with Bogart and the murder victim seem from another movie altogether, and you feel cheated when the likeable murder victim turns out to be so irrelevant to the story.

Lovins ""Mr. Jim""","[1, 1]","Columbia Pictures  presents ""IN A LONELY PLACE"" (1950) (94 min/B&W;) -- Starring Humphrey Bogart, Gloria Grahame, Frank Lovejoy, Carl Benton Reid & Art SmithDirected by Nicholas RayScreenwriter Dixon Steele, faced with the odious task of scripting a trashy bestseller, has hat-check girl Mildred Atkinson tell him the story in her own words. Later that night, Mildred is murdered and Steele is a prime suspect; his record of belligerence when angry and his macabre sense of humor tell against him. Fortunately, lovely neighbor Laurel Gray gives him an alibi. Laurel proves to be just what Steele needed, and their friendship ripens into love. Will suspicion, doubt, and Steele's inner demons come between them?Despite the fact that the plot is ostensibly a 'did he do it?' crime story, this is largely inconsequential to the psychological character and relationship study that is the central concern of the film. The script is smart, witty and cynical, just like a typical Bogart character. But in this film Bogart plays probably his darkest character. The cynical, darker aspects of this film just go to highlight how few contemporary films are prepared to be so bleak.In some of the scenes with Gloria Grahame he's at his smooth, wisecracking, slightly irritable best, but in the moments where the anger and the fog of despair descends he is a more threatening character than in any of his other leading man roles.If you like a cracking script with sharp performances, with all kinds of deep psychological observations on love and loneliness to be read into it, in the best noir tradition, this is the film for you.""In A Lonely Place"" could be director Nicholas Ray's best. It's a fascinating movie that mixes drama, suspense and romance in a very interesting way.

He has tried to fill it with booze and by surrounding himself with weak and absolvitory personalities called friends. But the void is still there -- until he is questioned for the murder of a woman he took home the prior evening.From the opening scene, it is apparent that Dixon has a temper. Frequently, his extended fingers are around someone's neck, fists are pummeling someone's face, or his sharp tongue is cutting someone's dignity. The lengthy assault rap sheet makes him prime suspect in the murder investigation. His insolent attitude doesn't win any mercy.Fortunately, an airtight alibi walks out of the interrogation room and into his lonely place. ""I was born when she kissed me."" Neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) elevates him from his writer's rut and inspires hope and joy. Initially blind to his imperfections, she begins to have second thoughts about the whirlwind relationship after Dixon erupts into a volcano before her very eyes. Then she begins to fear for her own life.Leaving a volatile and possessive Dixon is not as easy as hopping on the next plane. ""I died when she left me"" is a line from his most recent script inspired by the love of his life. ""I lived a few weeks while she loved me,"" the quote continues. Will the two find happiness in marriage or will she be found strangled in A LONELY PLACE like the girl before her?Movie quote: ""Do you look down on all women or just the ones you know?""",5,A man lives in it.

That's worth something.  We all know people like that, and most of us are occasionally like that ourselves, hopefully not on too many occasions.Here's an example of what I consider the artistry of this film.  A contrite Bogart is promising never to lose it again.  We, the audience, know that he can't possibly keep that promise.  Within minutes he loses it.We feel his controlling nature.  It's like we are in the room with it.  It's good for a film to reflect back to us such a common aspect of human nature.The reason I'm not giving this five stars is that I didn't find it an enjoyable or uplifting movie.  It didn't reach my heart.  It is unfortunate that the Bogart character is so messed up.  Do you really enjoy, for example, watching a drunken bum stagger down a city street?  Yes it is a part of reality, but it doesn't reach your heart, doesn't uplift you.I'd compare the distastefulness of watching a pathetic bum staggering around to the distastefulness of watching the Bogart character in this film exhibiting his personality disorder.  It's not pleasant to be around.As for the murder mystery itself, I solved that as soon as I heard who was killed.  I knew who the culprit was as soon as he first appeared onscreen, just for a moment.  It was a no-brainer, and I'm surprised the cops didn't see it as such.  Who murders a girl?  Who is almost always the culprit?  Please, it's obvious.This is a good movie.  I don't think it's a great one.  Bogart has starred in greater movies than this.

They begin a relationship and Grahame discovers his frightening violent tendencies. Now even she begins to doubt his innocence as well as fear for her own safety. Film crackles with cynicism and tension throughout and offers one of Bogart's best performances as the troubled writer struggling with his inner demons. Grahame is excellent in one of her first big roles before becoming the 50's film noir femme fatale she later did. Ironically, the film was directed by the great Nicholas Ray whose marriage to Grahame was falling apart at the time. This could explain why it has a bleak, gloomy feel to it and the two leads are such tormented characters who are powerless over their destinies. A must see, a must on DVD and a must have for those who know what Bogart could do in a role like this, for fans of Grahame and especially for those who are familiar with Nicholas Ray.

336845,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,6302801133,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[24, 27]","Nicholas Ray's In a Lonely Place, released by Columbia Pictures in 1950, was long regarded as one of star Humphrey Bogart's minor films, as were most of the Columbia released Santana productions he made both during and after his lengthy and legendary tenure at Warner Bros. Now, the film is considered to contain one of his strongest performances. The Production Company was Bogart's own (Santana was the name of his yacht), which he started in 1948 and sold to Columbia Pictures in 1954. In a Lonely Place is not a whodunit, but it is cleverly disguised as one. The murder and suspense play a backstory to the study of an emotionally sick man involved in a world of strange tensions. The world is Hollywood and although a studio or camera are never seen on the screen, the film captures the loneliness, the lushness, and the edginess of it all. This remains one of the filmmaker's greatest and most deeply resonant features, and one of Bogart's best roles.Bogart plays Dix Steele, a fading screenwriter suffering from creative burnout. He is hired to adapt a best-selling novel, but instead of reading the book himself, he asks the hatcheck girl at his favorite nightclub to read the book and simply tell him the plot. The next morning, the girl is found brutally murdered, and Steele is the prime suspect. There isn't enough evidence to arrest him, but he's so good at thinking like a killer, and is always so up-front about what's on his mind, the police are forced to suspect him. ""I'll be going now,"" he tells them. ""Unless you plan on arresting me for lack of emotion.""It is the would-be starlet who has starred in a couple of B-pictures, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), a new tenant in Dix's apartment complex, who provides him with a solid alibi. Soon, they begin a romance in spite of Gray's lingering concerns that the violent Steele might in fact be the deadly killer, plunging the audience into an intriguing and suspenseful mystery, which quickly becomes a backdrop to the troubled romance between the two wonderfully realized characters.A lesser director may have established Dix's innocence earlier on and although the spectator naturally assumes Dix is guilt-free (indeed, he does have an air-tight alibi), screenwriters Edmund H. North and Andrew Solt go to great lengths to play with audience expectations, although the film is more about the loneliness and despair in Tinseltown than about the murder mystery surrounding it. We don't see for ourselves that the cynical, alcoholic, and abusive Steele did not kill the hatcheck girl, and of course we have doubts since there is a limited amount of suspects. The only other suspect is Henry Kessler, who was Mildred's boyfriend. Dix, however, claims to have gone to sleep right after directing the girl to walk a block and take a cab home, but he is unable to provide the police with an alibi, and a tightening knot of suspicion begins to form around the writer. It is Mrs. Gray who claims she saw the hatcheck girl leave the apartment complex alone and provides him with one, and the couple fall in love as the suspense mounts.At first, the new relationship is invigorating for the hard-boiled writer, who plunges into his latest script with a renewed vigor and discipline. But as the police continue to shadow him, Steele's own penchant for violence erupts against friends, strangers, and even Laurel herself, whose feelings are increasingly eclipsed by suspicion that her lover is a murderer, causing their relationship to spiral and her love to turn into mistrust, and fear. Bogart conveys Steele's world-weariness and underlying vulnerability, and manages the delicate task of making both his romantic yearning and sudden, murderous rages equally convincing. It gave him a role he could play with complexity, because the character's pride in his art, his selfishness, drunkenness, and lack of energy, stabbed with lightening strokes of violence, were shared by the real Bogart. Ultimately, that performance and Grahame's sympathetic work elevate In a Lonely Place into what has been called ""an existential love story"" more than a crime drama. The film is a desperate tale of fear and self-loathing in Hollywood cleverly posing as a taut noir thriller. It is the closing lines of the film version, which Dix had written into hisscreenplay, that lingered in my mind longer than anything else. ""I was born when she kissed me, I died when she left me, I lived a few weeks while she loved me."" That powerful line sums up Dix's love life, and the film, extremely well",5,Captivating!!!!,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,4530,"['Nicholas', 'Ray', 'Lonely', 'Place', 'released', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', '1950', 'was', 'long', 'regarded', 'one', 'star', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'minor', 'films', 'were', 'most', 'Columbia', 'released', 'Santana', 'productions', 'made', 'lengthy', 'legendary', 'tenure', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Now', 'film', 'considered', 'contain', 'one', 'strongest', 'performances', 'Production', 'Company', 'was', 'Bogart', 'own', 'Santana', 'was', 'name', 'yacht', 'started', '1948', 'sold', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', '1954', 'Lonely', 'Place', 'not', 'whodunit', 'cleverly', 'disguised', 'one', 'murder', 'suspense', 'play', 'backstory', 'study', 'emotionally', 'sick', 'man', 'involved', 'world', 'strange', 'tensions', 'world', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'camera', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'screen', 'film', 'loneliness', 'lushness', 'edginess', 'one', 'filmmaker', 'greatest', 'most', 'deeply', 'resonant', 'features', 'one', 'Bogart', 'best', 'roles.Bogart', 'Dix', 'Steele', 'fading', 'screenwriter', 'suffering', 'creative', 'burnout', 'hired', 'adapt', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'instead', 'reading', 'book', 'hatcheck', 'girl', 'favorite', 'nightclub', 'read', 'book', 'simply', 'tell', 'plot', 'next', 'morning', 'girl', 'found', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Steele', 'prime', 'suspect', ""n't"", 'enough', 'evidence', 'arrest', 'so', 'good', 'thinking', 'killer', 'always', 'so', 'up-front', 'what', 'mind', 'police', 'are', 'forced', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'be', 'going', 'now', 'plan', 'arresting', 'lack', 'emotion', 'would-be', 'starlet', 'who', 'starred', 'couple', 'B-pictures', 'Laurel', 'Gray', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'new', 'tenant', 'Dix', 'apartment', 'complex', 'who', 'solid', 'alibi', 'Soon', 'begin', 'romance', 'spite', 'Gray', 'lingering', 'concerns', 'violent', 'Steele', 'might', 'fact', 'be', 'deadly', 'killer', 'plunging', 'audience', 'intriguing', 'suspenseful', 'mystery', 'quickly', 'backdrop', 'troubled', 'romance', 'two', 'wonderfully', 'realized', 'characters.A', 'lesser', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'established', 'Dix', 'innocence', 'earlier', 'spectator', 'naturally', 'Dix', 'guilt-free', 'indeed', 'have', 'air-tight', 'alibi', 'screenwriters', 'Edmund', 'H.', 'North', 'Andrew', 'Solt', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'play', 'audience', 'expectations', 'film', 'more', 'loneliness', 'despair', 'Tinseltown', 'murder', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'cynical', 'alcoholic', 'abusive', 'Steele', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'hatcheck', 'girl', 'course', 'have', 'doubts', 'limited', 'amount', 'suspects', 'only', 'other', 'suspect', 'Henry', 'Kessler', 'who', 'was', 'Mildred', 'boyfriend', 'Dix', 'however', 'claims', 'have', 'gone', 'sleep', 'right', 'directing', 'girl', 'walk', 'block', 'take', 'cab', 'home', 'unable', 'provide', 'police', 'alibi', 'tightening', 'knot', 'suspicion', 'begins', 'form', 'writer', 'Mrs.', 'Gray', 'who', 'saw', 'hatcheck', 'girl', 'leave', 'apartment', 'complex', 'alone', 'one', 'couple', 'fall', 'love', 'suspense', 'mounts.At', 'first', 'new', 'relationship', 'invigorating', 'hard-boiled', 'writer', 'who', 'latest', 'script', 'renewed', 'vigor', 'discipline', 'police', 'continue', 'shadow', 'Steele', 'own', 'penchant', 'violence', 'erupts', 'friends', 'strangers', 'even', 'Laurel', 'feelings', 'are', 'increasingly', 'eclipsed', 'suspicion', 'lover', 'murderer', 'causing', 'relationship', 'spiral', 'love', 'turn', 'mistrust', 'fear', 'Bogart', 'Steele', 'world-weariness', 'underlying', 'vulnerability', 'delicate', 'task', 'making', 'romantic', 'yearning', 'sudden', 'murderous', 'rages', 'equally', 'convincing', 'gave', 'role', 'could', 'play', 'complexity', 'character', 'pride', 'art', 'selfishness', 'drunkenness', 'lack', 'energy', 'stabbed', 'lightening', 'strokes', 'violence', 'were', 'shared', 'real', 'Bogart', 'Ultimately', 'performance', 'Grahame', 'sympathetic', 'work', 'elevate', 'Lonely', 'Place', 'what', 'been', 'called', 'existential', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'crime', 'drama', 'film', 'desperate', 'tale', 'fear', 'self-loathing', 'Hollywood', 'cleverly', 'posing', 'taut', 'noir', 'thriller', 'closing', 'lines', 'film', 'version', 'Dix', 'had', 'written', 'hisscreenplay', 'lingered', 'mind', 'longer', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'born', 'when', 'kissed', 'died', 'when', 'left', 'lived', 'few', 'weeks', 'loved', 'powerful', 'line', 'sums', 'up', 'Dix', 'love', 'life', 'film', 'extremely', 'well']",In a Lonely Place VHS

336847,AUNHTUF4ATEJM,6302801133,M. C. Crammer,"[1, 1]","Humphrey Bogart plays Dixon Steele, a once successful Hollywood screenplay writer who hasn't had a hit for a while.  He's asked to adapt a book to a screenplay, a job that he regards with some arrogant scorn, and in the process invites home a young hatcheck girl who has the book.  Shortly afterwards, she's found dead, and not surprisingly, he's the number one suspect.  And no wonder!  He has a history of violent outbursts -- bar fights, domestic conflicts, that sort of thing but has somehow escaped doing time for it.  He's also a WWII veteran (is that the source of his outbursts of rage?) and one of the police investigating the case served under him in the war.  Dix gets involved with his alibi -- a woman in the same apartment complex who says she saw the woman leave alive.  She falls in love with him but is increasingly troubled by what she sees.I am amazed at reviews who say this is about the effect that the police investigation has on their relationship.  I don't see it that way at all -- I see it as a woman discovering that the man she is falling for has a big anger management problem.  One is left to ponder why it takes her as long as it does to realize how bad this problem is, and to consider -- based on what she sees of him at his worst -- the possibility that he did indeed kill the hatcheck girl.

336848,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,6302801133,Mcgivern Owen L,"[3, 3]","The aptly titled ""In a Lonely Place"" is harsh and stark film noir. As the story opens, Humphrey Bogart is a struggling writer with a reputation for being hard to work with and mean tempered. Bogey lands a job doing screenplay but is too lazy to actually read the book! HB invites a hatcheck girl, who has read it, to his apartment to relate the plot. Irritable and bored, he dismisses her. No gentleman, he directs the girl to a nearby cabstand. By the next morning, she is dead and HB is the main suspect. Viewers know Bogey is innocent but the cops don't. Sultry neighbor Gloria Grahame, builds up HB's alibi and the pair are soon in love. GG is the perfect noir girl; her gloomy performance perhaps enhanced by her deteriorating marriage to Director Nicholas Ray. The crux of the film is how the continuing pressure from the Law eats away at Bogey, exposing his fragile personality and worsening his already bad temper. He loses it in Grahame's presence once too often and she begins to doubt him. Afraid to spurn his marriage proposal, she plans to run away. And then? This reviewer won't give away the ending, but the final scenes are good, solid no nonsense, and uncompromising. One can hear that door slam at the fadeout. Viewers should be alert for two big clues. With 20/20 hindsight, the perp is actually quite obvious, in fact the crime is solved in the middle of the film.... but only the most observant will notice! This is because many scenes pass quickly-ILP demands utmost attention. Some will hit that rewind button. ILP will doubtless be more rewarding with multiple viewings; it has certainly aged well. This reviewer is not a major Bogey fan but the guy is well cast here. True HB devotees should pounce.

336853,A1FG91CM8221X1,6302801133,Miles D. Moore,"[2, 2]","Nicholas Ray's ""In a Lonely Place"" is one of the strangest films ever released by a major Hollywood studio. It asks us to invest our sympathy in Dixon Steele, a gifted but violent-tempered screenwriter whose salient trait is his total inability to tolerate any sort of insult or contradiction, no matter how minor. Columbia Pictures advertised this as a mystery, but it's a mystery of a very special sort: We know from the beginning--as does his neighbor and soon-to-be lover Laurel Grey--that Steele gave Mildred Atkinson $20 for a taxi and sent her home, so he couldn't have been responsible when she turned up dead a few hours later. Yet Steele's subsequent behavior is so weird and brutal--and his past history of violence so damning--that we start having the same doubts as Laurel. Could Steele have changed his mind and followed Mildred? Could Mildred have forgotten something, come back, and said or done something to set off Steele's notorious temper? Ricocheting off this main story are all sorts of unspoken questions: Even if Steele is innocent, is he a perp-in-waiting, a psychopath who simply hasn't gotten around to committing a murder just yet? And how much leeway should we give to geniuses who consistently exhibit anti-social behavior? In any case, it took a great deal of courage for Ray to ask us to spend time with Steele, and even more for Humphrey Bogart to play him. There were parallels (unfortunately) between Steele and Bogart's own volatile personality; indeed, Bogart's own company, Santana Productions, produced this film. Whether Bogart intended this film as apology or apologia, he gives one of his most subtle and heartfelt performances here, deftly mingling his trademark charm and charisma with terrifying eruptions of anger. Gloria Grahame, exhibiting the bruised, hard-bitten innocence that made her such a compelling actress, is the perfect match for Bogart. There are similarities between ""In a Lonely Place"" and Hitchcock's ""Suspicion,"" but ""In a Lonely Place"" is the movie that got the story right: Ray and Bogart both understood that no happy endings could ensue from such a story. Above all, they understood that, if you're very unlucky, you end up being your own destiny.",4,A strange but rewarding film.,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,2215,"['Nicholas', 'Ray', 'Lonely', 'Place', 'one', 'strangest', 'films', 'ever', 'released', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'invest', 'sympathy', 'Dixon', 'Steele', 'gifted', 'violent-tempered', 'screenwriter', 'salient', 'trait', 'total', 'inability', 'tolerate', 'sort', 'insult', 'contradiction', 'matter', 'how', 'minor', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'advertised', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'very', 'special', 'sort', 'know', 'beginning', 'neighbor', 'soon-to-be', 'lover', 'Laurel', 'Grey', 'Steele', 'gave', 'Mildred', 'Atkinson', '20', 'taxi', 'sent', 'home', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'responsible', 'when', 'turned', 'up', 'dead', 'few', 'hours', 'later', 'Steele', 'subsequent', 'behavior', 'so', 'weird', 'brutal', 'past', 'history', 'violence', 'so', 'damning', 'start', 'having', 'same', 'doubts', 'Laurel', 'Could', 'Steele', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'followed', 'Mildred', 'Could', 'Mildred', 'have', 'forgotten', 'something', 'come', 'back', 'said', 'done', 'something', 'set', 'off', 'Steele', 'notorious', 'temper', 'Ricocheting', 'off', 'main', 'story', 'are', 'sorts', 'unspoken', 'questions', 'Even', 'Steele', 'innocent', 'perp-in-waiting', 'psychopath', 'who', 'simply', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'committing', 'murder', 'just', 'yet', 'how', 'much', 'leeway', 'should', 'give', 'geniuses', 'who', 'consistently', 'exhibit', 'anti-social', 'behavior', 'case', 'took', 'great', 'deal', 'courage', 'Ray', 'ask', 'spend', 'time', 'Steele', 'even', 'more', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'play', 'were', 'parallels', 'unfortunately', 'Steele', 'Bogart', 'own', 'volatile', 'personality', 'indeed', 'Bogart', 'own', 'company', 'Santana', 'Productions', 'produced', 'film', 'Whether', 'Bogart', 'intended', 'film', 'apology', 'apologia', 'one', 'most', 'subtle', 'heartfelt', 'performances', 'here', 'deftly', 'mingling', 'trademark', 'charm', 'charisma', 'terrifying', 'eruptions', 'anger', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'exhibiting', 'bruised', 'hard-bitten', 'innocence', 'made', 'such', 'compelling', 'actress', 'perfect', 'match', 'Bogart', 'are', 'similarities', 'Lonely', 'Place', 'Hitchcock', 'Suspicion', 'Lonely', 'Place', 'movie', 'got', 'story', 'right', 'Ray', 'Bogart', 'understood', 'happy', 'endings', 'could', 'ensue', 'such', 'story', 'understood', ""'re"", 'very', 'unlucky', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'own', 'destiny']",In a Lonely Place VHS

When he's asked to adapt a popular novel, Dix invites an enthusiastic young hatcheck girl (Martha Stewart) who has read the book to tell him about it. She cancels a date for the chance to explain the novel to the famous screenwriter, and he's happy not to have to read the book. But Dix is summoned to the police station for questioning the next day, because the young woman was murdered shortly after leaving his apartment. A neighbor, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), who saw Dix the night before from her balcony, verifies that the murder victim left Dix's apartment alone. But Dix remains the police's prime suspect, as he and Laurel fall in love. Although she loves Dix, his controlling, violent personality eventually cause Laurel to distrust him, and then to suspect that he may be guilty of murder, after all.""In a Lonely Place"" is loosely based on the novel by Dorothy B. Hughes and is wonderfully reflexive in that Dixon Steele adapts a novel in the film, which he alters dramatically for his purposes. Edmund H. North, who adapted ""In a Lonely Place"", departed radically from Hughes' novel and completely rewrote the Dix character. Dixon Steele is a typical film noir protagonist in that he falls victim to his own character flaw: his violent and controlling nature. ""In a Lonely Place"" is a ""Hollywood insider"" film that takes place in and around the filmmaking industry and presents an unflattering view of the industry's motives and the audience's tastes. Even Burnett Guffey's ""sunny California"" cinematography is dark. Dix is to some extent made a heroic figure within this environment by his stubbornness -a writer with integrity trying to do good work in an industry of ""popcorn salesman"". Director Nicholas Ray is masterful at manipulating the audience's sympathies from Dix to Laurel and back again. When we are sympathetic to Dix, he frustrates the audience by being his own worst enemy. When he is callous and volatile, we wonder if he committed the crime. Ultimately, ""In a Lonely Place"" is about the corrosive effects of distrust and suspicion. Humphrey Bogart achieves true acting greatness with his complex performance, which is one of the most memorable of his career.The DVD: Bonus features include 2 documentaries, a sort of retrospective of Bogart's career, and trailers for ""In a Lonely Place"", ""The Lady from Shanghai"", and ""The Big Heat"". ""In a Lonely Place Revisited"" (20 minutes) is hosted by director Curtis Hanson. Speaking from the courtyard of the hacienda-style apartment community where Dix and Laurel lived in the film, Hanson talks about various aspects of the film, including the director, actors, characters, and the collaboration between director Nicholas Ray and Humphrey Bogart that produced such an emotionally honest performance. He also contrasts the film and the book on which it was based. Commentary is illustrated with film clips. ""In a Lonely Place: Restoration Story"" (5 minutes) is an interesting look at the process of restoring the film from its original, very battered, cellulose nitrate film stock. Includes interviews with Sony's Vice President of Asset Management, Grover Crisp, the folks at Cinetech who restored the film images, and the folks at Chase Productions who restored the film's sound. ""The Bogart Collection"" (4 minutes) is a text bio of Humphrey Bogart's career, followed by posters and publicity stills for some of his films.

336855,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6302801133,Nix Pix,"[28, 35]","Nicholas Ray's ""In A Lonely Place"" is one of those eternally compelling film noirs that haunts you once you've seen it. Bogart is screenwriter, Dixon Steele. He's got a terrible temper that doesn't make him popular either amongst the studio big shots or his nightclubbing buddies. But has that uncontrollable rage led him to kill? Det. Sgt. Brub Nicholai (Frank Lovejoy) and Capt. Lochner (Carl Benton Reid) seem to think so. Dix' is their prime suspect in the homicide of a cocktail waitress. Of course it doesn't help that she was a guest at Steele's home the very night that she disappeared. Apart from its initial focus on murder, the bulk of this film is a moody melodrama buttressed by an impossible romance.As is his trademark, Bogie plays Dix' as the brooding outsider but with an undercarriage of wicked cynicism that, at times, can be quite unsettling. Gloria Grahame costars as Bogie's sultry neighbor, Laurel Gray. At first believing Dix's innocence she embarks upon an ill-fated relationship, against both her better judgment and the advice of her meddling masseur, Martha (Ruth Gilette). Director Nicholas Ray keeps the tension taut yet supple, manipulating his audience with the proverbial ""did he or didn't he"" question ever looming in the back of our minds until the final fade out. But the film suffers somewhat from an inconsistent commitment to its many plot threads which never add up to a satisfactory conclusion in the end. Instead we are given a series of vignettes - - some feeling as though they belong to another movie - - and then a truncated conclusion which appears more the tack on after three or four viewings.I'm not sure what the term ""complete digital restoration"" means over at Columbia Studios. When I think in those terms flashes of Paramount's ""Sunset Blvd."" or Warner's ""Mildred Pierce"" immediately come to mind. But when Columbia uses it, as they do in their 'restoration snippet trailer' included on this disc, they merely mean that they've digitally repaired some of the glaring rips and tears in the original camera negative. That's not complete and it's not even close to what a film like ""In A Lonely Place needs. Throughout this often low contrasted B&W; image, there is an excessive amount of film grain, dirt, scratches and, on occasion, aliasing and shimmering of fine details. Night scenes are worse off than day scenes, showing signs of rear projection photography that are extremely grainy and sometimes even out of focus. Indoor and day scenes on the whole fare better.

336858,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6302801133,Only-A-Child,"[3, 6]","Nicholas Ray's ""In a Lonely Place"" (1950) owes most of its suspense to the same gradual revelations that characterized Hitchcock's ""Sabotage"" and Lang's ""Fury"". All three films concern a woman's slow realization that her husband, fianc&eacute;e, boyfriend is a monster. Shortly after moving into a new apartment, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) discovers a mutual attraction between herself and neighbor Dixon ""Dix"" Steele (Humphrey Bogart).Their actual introduction is at police headquarters where successful screenwriter Dix is being questioned regarding his relationship with Mildred Atkinson (Martha Stewart), a ""hat-check"" girl who had visited Dix in his apartment a few hours before her murder. Laurel is able to supply an alibi, having spotted Mildred leaving the apartment alone.Dix is unmotivated but takes on a new project, adapting a novel for a producer who intends to make it into a movie. His romance with Laurel is a great tonic and he works hard on this screenplay. Early on the viewer learns that Dix is subject to fits of temper and rage, and needs little provocation to become completely unglued. But the viewer also sees his good qualities, he quickly comes to the defense of an older actor who has a drinking problem and does not take advantage of young Mildred during her late night visit to his apartment.Despite his alibi, the police continue to suspect Dix of Mildred's murder; mostly because of his past history of violence. Brub Nicolai (Frank Lovejoy), an old war buddy and now a police detective, defends him and even has him over for dinner; although Brub's wife thinks that Dix has serious psychological problems.The remainder of the story is told from Laurel's point-of-view. The two fall in love but as Dix's issues begin to manifest themselves she begins to wonder if he might actually be the murderer. He knows a little too much about the murder and rather oddly isn't angry about being a suspect, while his increasingly erratic behavior in other areas begins to terrify her.In both ""Sabotage"" and ""Fury"" the good girl role was played very effectively by Sylvia Sidney, whose considerable acting for the camera skills allowed her to nonverbally convey her character's growing suspicion and eventual realization that a man she once trusted has a dangerous hidden side. Grahame's performance is not as nuanced but is still quite effective. Best remembered for her comedic role as Ado Annie in ""Oklahoma"", she was well suited to this type of airhead role (in the tradition of Una Merkel and Zasu Pitts).  Yet she had considerable range as a serious actress, which she demonstrated here and again in ""The Big Heat"".Bogart's Dix is a precursor of his Captain Quig character in ""The Caine Mutiny"". But Dix has considerably more dimensions and Bogart alternates between his standard ""tough but basically good"" loner and the disturbed Quig. This multi-dimensionality makes him very real and ultimately sympathetic as the viewer comes to realize that the title's ""lonely place"" is inside Dix's mind.""In a Lonely Place"" is a bit different than classic film noir. It is considerably more powerful and disturbing because the standard film noir murder element is of minimal importance. Instead Ray concentrates on making the viewer really care about his characters, hoping that Laurel's love will continue to transform Dix and so that he will eventually find a way to cope with his inner demons.Then again, what do I know?

336864,A16QODENBJVUI1,6302801133,Robert Moore,"[1, 4]","This is by no stretch neither one of Bogart's best nor one of his worse films. In the late 1940s and 1950s, as Bogart began to break away from Warner Brothers and do more independent films, he began more and more to explore a greater variety of roles. In this one, he plays a lawyer who managed to break out of the rough and nasty neighborhood where he grew up, and a young tough who has been unable to break out and has gotten himself into a string of bad situations. The young thug is played by John Derek, who would go on to appear in a number of films (such as ALL THE KINGS MEN and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, in which he would play Joshua) before becoming a photographer and director an husband of a number of famed (and similar looking) beauties, including Ursala Andress, Linda Evans, and Bo Derek). Given the utterly horrible movies he directed starring Bo Derek, it was quite a nice surprise to see what a nice job he does in this film. He was not merely a pretty face; he had some talent.Bogart managed to excel in every movie he was ever in, with only a few exceptions, like THE OKLAHOMA KID, a Western in which he played a Mexican bandit, complete with utterly unconvincing accent. Apart from that and a couple of other 1930s roles, Bogart managed to shine even when the rest of the movie was vile.The problem with KNOCK ON ANY DOOR is twofold. One is the highly artificial script, in which much of the film is told in flashback in what is supposed to be the opening remarks at a trial. It is unbalancing to have so much of the film told in flashback at a moment in a trial when such personal remarks would have been inappropriate. As a result, the trial ends up feeling not so much like a trial as a parody of a trial. The second problem is that the movie is a bit heavy handed in its social commentary. That society can have a pervasive and overwhelming influence on the ultimate destiny of a young person had been developed in the late 19th century by people like Jane Addams, and had become commonplace in the following decades. Many films of the 1930s focused on the importance of providing kids with more positive social influences, like DEAD END and BOY'S TOWN. KNOCK ON ANY DOOR tries to get a lot of mileage out of an idea that was hardly new.

336868,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,6302801133,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[1, 2]","This is a great, but uncomfortable film, about a deeply flawed man.  Dixon Steele.  Although he hasn't written a successful script for some time, is still a highly regarded writer.  He is also a revolving, 360 degree pig.  He is moody, self-centered with numerous flashes of violent anger.  Because, as we learn, Dix had some kind of unspecified military role during the War, we might conclude that Dix' personality is the product of PTSD.  That would be a far too superficial analysis of the labile, non-insightful Dix.A lovely young woman has been brutally murdered.  She is the same young woman Dix lured to his apartment the previous night on the pretext of her retelling and summarizing a book she's written and would like to see worked into the script of a film.  The whole thing--including the girl--is so shallow and dreary to the world-weary Dix that he tells her to find her own way home.  ""Here's some money for the taxi.""  He gallantly offers.The next morning Dix is picked up by the cops and interrogated.  On learning of the girl's death, Dix is neither frightened nor guilty about the fact that, by not seeing her safely home, he has inadvertently delivered her up to death.  Dix, as a matter of fact, is cool, calm, unflustered and uncaring.  He's even too stupid to recognize that his thoughtless behavior NECESSARILY puts him under the police microscope.  Let me emphasize that these are not PTSD symptoms.  They are symptoms of something far darker and deeper...something produced perhaps by twisted DNA.The woman Dix supposedly loves becomes increasingly frightened of her unpredictable paramour.  She doesn't know whether he's a murderer or not but she does know that he's explosive and dangerous.  She's caught in a classical 'abused woman' scenario.  She needs to get out...and get out now...before he kills her.I believe Bogart was at his very best when playing deeply flawed characters.

It's only because of that and the raves from other reviewers that I decided to rent it. The opening stop-light confrontation scene was familiar, but seriously, I don't believe Bogie as a physical, tough guy like when I was a kid.  Look at how tiny his torso is when he's not wearing a jacket! He looked great in a tailored jacket. His wardrobe here looks just like his off-screen Hollywood night-club style you can see in all the bios about him.(Cagney really was tough! When he worked with the Dead-end Kids,he didn't take any crap off them the way Bogie did on the CRIME SCHOOL set.) The scene where he beats up a healthy looking young college guy half his age is ludicrous.Otherwise the plot and pacing are dreadfully slow, and the other actors are more nostalgic than convincing since they were mostly in film noir movies. Frank Lovejoy as the cop buddy was interesting.  Especially with the presumably Russian sur-name 'Nikolai.'  The only other movie I can recall Lovejoy being in wasn't 'I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE FBI' where his name was 'Cvetic.' In reality, I'm pretty sure he was Irish.  Gloria Grahame was good in a part that wasn't written very well.  Jeff Donnell was interesting to watch as Lovejoy's wife.

He has her over, she has a ginger ale (she's a swell kid, ya know) and he gives her some money for cab fare.  The next morning she's dead, killed by an unknown assassin.His only alibi, neighbor Laurel, gets him off, but police suspicions run high.  Soon, she begins do doubt that her lover hasn't actually done it to a point of fear and depression!Several points to this film: Bogie hates the screenwriter hacks who pump out film after film successfully, bowing to the demands of Hollywood (those damn popcorn factories!).  I can relate.  How many times have we seen plays based on books that were a mere shadow of the author's intentions?Women in this film notice Dix a lot more than the other way around and often comment on his honest face.  Unfortunately with the face comes a fiery temper that makes people wonder.  Did he do it or didn't he?Nicholas Ray's use of lighting in this Black & White flick is masterful.  The lights shine on Dix's eyes as someone points him out in the street.  Again, the same intense, crazy light shines as if from his eyes as he dramatizes to his cop friend how the murder may have occurred: ""use your imagination""...and ""take your arm around her neck and squeeze, squeeze the life out of her!""Cool extras by a film historian and the usual subtitles and scene selections.

One of the scenes that really stands out is the scene in the car after leaving the beach - where bogie's character projects his anger on to an innocent person on the road.. Road rage apparently has  been around for years and is merely another guise for internal problems which are projected upon a convenient victim..Though not at all what i expected this film noir to be - I was very satisfied with the extremely tense performances and direction of this fine film and i would really like to watch it again as i think there are a lot of subtleties that i missed out on...",5,a movie that is about so many things..,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,1372,"['lonely', 'place', 'not', 'very', 'typical', 'movie', 'early', ""50's.."", 'Often', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'nicholas', 'ray', 'indictment', 'film', 'industry..', 'case', 'excellent', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'murder', 'so', 'much', 'relationship..', 'Boogie', 'role', 'famous', 'hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'subtle', 'roles', 'really', 'come', 'quite', 'well', 'hair-trigger', 'tempered', 'talented', 'yet', 'extremely', 'needy', 'writer..', 'moodswings', 'often', 'show', 'just', 'what', 'fine', 'line', 'people', 'walk', 'being', 'relatively', 'normal', 'being', 'crazed', 'murderous', 'lunatic..Nicholas', 'Rays', 'direction', 'really', 'living', 'surroundings', 'well..', 'most', 'movie', 'place', 'dix', 'steele', 'apartment', 'few', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'set', 'beach', 'bar', 'police', 'station..', 'One', 'scenes', 'really', 'out', 'scene', 'car', 'leaving', 'beach', 'where', 'bogie', 'character', 'projects', 'anger', 'innocent', 'person', 'road..', 'Road', 'rage', 'apparently', 'been', 'years', 'merely', 'guise', 'internal', 'problems', 'are', 'projected', 'convenient', 'not', 'what', 'i', 'expected', 'film', 'noir', 'be', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'extremely', 'tense', 'performances', 'direction', 'fine', 'film', 'i', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'watch', 'again', 'i', 'think', 'are', 'lot', 'subtleties', 'i', 'missed', 'out']",In a Lonely Place VHS

It's odd that a movie of this magnitude seems to take a lesser position in the press than does ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""To Have and Have Not"", which were fine film work to be sure, but the depth of emotion and character portrayal done by Bogie in this movie is simply outstanding, in my view.Dix Steele is a talented, once powerful but now struggling Hollywood screen writer - whose soul is, indeed, lost in a ""lonely place"" from which he is powerless to extract himself.  Evidence of his personal failures is everywhere; they surround him, follow him.  His personality is such that it is easy for even those who know him best to suspect him of murder when a young woman he barely knew turned up dead after being at this apartment under totally benign circumstances.The story line is truly ahead of it's time; it may even have been one of the first films to address the agony of a mental illness that takes control of a person who in all other respects seems normal until something triggers his violent, suspicious responses all of which seem to be tied to an unwarranted insecurity.  Adding to the remarkable insight of this story, he seems to know what his problem is.  He even retreats occasionally in the midst of a sudden, uncontrolled outburst as though he recognizes what he is doing; yet it is not enough to save him.  He loses his dignity, his pride; and literally all of his relationships to it, including the love and respect of a woman he has waited a lifetime to obtain and who tries to return his love;  his entire existence goes down before it.

336874,AXR6S03DUXYCN,6302801133,"TK Malone ""tkmalone""","[1, 1]","Nicholas Ray's film noir is a departure for Humphrey Bogart and for the film noir genre itself.Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart), a washed-up screenwriter with a flashpoint temper and a violent streak, is equal parts Rick Blaine and Fred C. Dobbs. Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) is the antithesis of the dumb blonde.The script by Andrew Solt from Dorothy B. Hughes's novel has all the crisp, Chandleresque dialogue of the best film noir but with an emotional intensity not usually associated with the genre. The film works better as a romance between two damaged people than as a crime drama. George Antheil's score works wonders at underscoring their anguish.Dix's agent Mel Lippmann (Art Smith) asks the old hack to dinner to consider adapting a Harlequinesque romance novel that hack director Lloyd Barnes (Morris Ankrum) is eager to shoot. On the way to the restaurant Dix nearly gets into a fight with a passing motorist and upon arrival at the bar DOES mix it up with some sonofaproducer who calls Dix's old buddy Charlie (Robert Warwick) the washed-up drunkard actor that he is.The semiliterate coat check girl Mildred Atkinson (Martha Stewart) gushes about the novel that Dix is up for adapting, so rather than read it, Dix invites her to his apartment to tell him the story. She has to break a date with her boyfriend to do so but as Dix says, &quot;There's no sacrifice too great for a chance at immortality.&quot;When one of Dix's old war-buddies-turned-police-detective Brub Nicolai (Frank Lovejoy) pays Dix a visit at 5 a.m., he thinks it's because the producer's son filed a complaint. He's wrong. The coat check girl has been murdered and thrown in a ditch.Dix's best defence is new neighbor Laurel Gray who saw the girl leave Dix's apartment alone. Dix falls for Laurel because she has a nice face. But she's a little more cautious.DIXON STEELE: Go ahead and get some sleep and we'll have dinner together tonight.LAUREL GRAY: We'll have dinner tonight. But not together.There are plenty of laughs supplied by Art Smith, Robert Warwick, and Ruth Warren as the cleaning lady who can never get either Dix's or Laurel's apartment clean.At its core, though, IN A LONELY PLACE is about two lonely people who clearly need but will not allow themselves to have each other.",5,Film Noir + Emotional Depth,1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,2275,"['Nicholas', 'Ray', 'film', 'noir', 'departure', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'film', 'noir', 'genre', 'itself.Dixon', 'Steele', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'washed-up', 'screenwriter', 'flashpoint', 'temper', 'violent', 'streak', 'equal', 'parts', 'Rick', 'Blaine', 'Fred', 'C.', 'Dobbs', 'Laurel', 'Gray', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'antithesis', 'dumb', 'blonde.The', 'script', 'Andrew', 'Solt', 'Dorothy', 'B.', 'Hughes', 'novel', 'crisp', 'Chandleresque', 'dialogue', 'best', 'film', 'noir', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'not', 'usually', 'associated', 'genre', 'film', 'better', 'romance', 'two', 'damaged', 'people', 'crime', 'drama', 'George', 'Antheil', 'score', 'wonders', 'underscoring', 'anguish.Dix', 'agent', 'Mel', 'Lippmann', 'Art', 'Smith', 'old', 'hack', 'dinner', 'consider', 'adapting', 'Harlequinesque', 'romance', 'novel', 'hack', 'director', 'Lloyd', 'Barnes', 'Morris', 'Ankrum', 'eager', 'shoot', 'way', 'restaurant', 'Dix', 'nearly', 'fight', 'passing', 'motorist', 'arrival', 'bar', 'DOES', 'mix', 'up', 'sonofaproducer', 'who', 'Dix', 'old', 'buddy', 'Charlie', 'Robert', 'Warwick', 'washed-up', 'drunkard', 'actor', 'is.The', 'semiliterate', 'coat', 'check', 'girl', 'Mildred', 'Atkinson', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'novel', 'Dix', 'up', 'adapting', 'rather', 'read', 'Dix', 'apartment', 'tell', 'story', 'break', 'date', 'boyfriend', 'do', 'so', 'Dix', 'quot', 'sacrifice', 'too', 'great', 'chance', 'immortality.', 'quot', 'When', 'one', 'Dix', 'old', 'war-buddies-turned-police-detective', 'Brub', 'Nicolai', 'Frank', 'Lovejoy', 'Dix', 'visit', '5', 'a.m.', 'producer', 'son', 'filed', 'complaint', 'wrong', 'coat', 'check', 'girl', 'been', 'murdered', 'thrown', 'ditch.Dix', 'best', 'defence', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Laurel', 'Gray', 'who', 'saw', 'girl', 'leave', 'Dix', 'apartment', 'alone', 'Dix', 'Laurel', 'nice', 'face', 'little', 'more', 'cautious.DIXON', 'STEELE', 'Go', 'ahead', 'get', 'sleep', ""'ll"", 'have', 'dinner', 'together', 'tonight.LAUREL', 'GRAY', ""'ll"", 'have', 'dinner', 'tonight', 'not', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'supplied', 'Art', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Warwick', 'Ruth', 'Warren', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'Dix', 'Laurel', 'apartment', 'clean.At', 'core', 'though', 'IN', 'A', 'LONELY', 'PLACE', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'who', 'clearly', 'need', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'have', 'other']",In a Lonely Place VHS

336876,A2U974OZOVRT7A,6302801133,Tom Without Pity,"[8, 9]","This is a review for IN A LONELY PLACE (1950) which  was one of my favorite Bogart movies  for years but with the rise in popularity of film noir it's hardly the unknown film it once was. Which is all right by me, the more people who see something that's really good, the more chances there'll be of other good films being seen and appreciated, I believe.IN A LONELY PLACE concerns an almost washed up screenwriter, Dixon Steele, played by Humphrey Bogart, who gets a chance to adapt a somewhat windy best selling ""epic novel"" into a screenplay as the basis for what hopefully will be a popular film. These words are not spoken in the film but it looks like this could be Dix Steele's last chance at a financially as well as artistically successful screenplay. Dix has a few problems, mainly drinking and a flashpoint temper that has led to a few violent episodes in the past including some involving the police. And now he is visibly aging but not necesarily mellowing.In truth, Dix is not enamored with the bestseller he has been given to adapt and when a enthusiastic checkroom girl named Mildred Atkinson , played by a Martha Stewart, gushes over the book and the possiblilty of a movie based on it, Dix gives her the job of coming back to his apartment to read the tome to him so he might have some idea of the book without exerting any undue effort.So the check room girl breaks her date with her banker boyfriend and goes with Dix to his courtyard apartment to dig into the book. Unfortunately things don't work out too well and Dix gives the girl some money for cabfare home and looking bone tired, says he's going to bed.Next thing he knows it's 5 AM and an old army buddy, now a plainclothes detective, well played by Frank Lovejoy, is ringing his doorbell wanting to talk with him about Mildred Atkinson. It turns out she was murdered before she could get a cab and Dix was the last known person to have seen her alive.While being questioned at the station house Dix answers to a police question that one person did see him when he said goodnight to Mildred Atkinson, a woman who lives across the courtyard. As it turns out the woman,Laurel Gray, played by Gloria Grahame, has taken notice of Dix and is aware that he is a screenwriter.As the film progresses so does the relationship between Dixon Steele and Laurel Gray. They both seem to get along well and she helps him with the screenplay, which needs a lot of help apparently.At times Dix forgets everything of the outside world, his mind is strictly involved with his writing for the first time in many years. A lot of that has to do with Laurel's keeping his mind on the track of the story.But occassionally another violent incident will occur, sometimes with Laurel there to witness it.In the meantime the police investigation seems to be progressing slowly if at all and Dix is still a primary suspect. Sometimes Laurel can't help but wonder with the evidence of Dix's sometimes violent nature if he's the one who killed MIldred Atkinson.In fact, that's the noirish part of the story that I enjoy most, the audience is left wondering if Dixon Steele can't control himself with ""these kids in their cut-down cars"" how would Dix react to an actual turndown from a young pretty girl? Especially after a couple of drinks, would he take it as a personal insult, something that had to be avenged immediately?That's the crux of the decision that Laurel has to make about Dix and herself.....and the decision the audience has to make about Dixon Steele and the entire story of IN A LONELY PLACE.It is a romance as well as a murder mystery with plenty of noir trappings thrown in, not just to confuse the characters, but to hold the audience in a gloomy cloud of suspense for as long as possible. And a fine job byeveryone involved, IN A LONELY PLACE is a memorable film, one that will hold your interest, to say the least, from beginning to end.""I was born when she kissed me.I died when she left me.I lived a few weeks while she loved me.""Humphrey Bogart as Dixon Steele inIN A LONELY PLACE (1950).",5,"""I lived a few weeks while she loved me.""",1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,4061,"['review', 'IN', 'A', 'LONELY', 'PLACE', '1950', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'Bogart', 'movies', 'years', 'rise', 'popularity', 'film', 'hardly', 'unknown', 'film', 'once', 'was', 'Which', 'right', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'something', 'really', 'good', 'more', 'chances', ""'ll"", 'be', 'other', 'good', 'films', 'being', 'seen', 'appreciated', 'believe.IN', 'LONELY', 'PLACE', 'almost', 'washed', 'up', 'screenwriter', 'Dixon', 'Steele', 'played', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'who', 'chance', 'adapt', 'somewhat', 'windy', 'best', 'selling', 'epic', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'basis', 'what', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'popular', 'film', 'words', 'are', 'not', 'spoken', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'Dix', 'Steele', 'last', 'chance', 'financially', 'as', 'well', 'artistically', 'successful', 'screenplay', 'Dix', 'few', 'problems', 'mainly', 'drinking', 'flashpoint', 'temper', 'led', 'few', 'violent', 'episodes', 'past', 'including', 'involving', 'police', 'now', 'visibly', 'aging', 'not', 'necesarily', 'mellowing.In', 'truth', 'Dix', 'not', 'enamored', 'bestseller', 'been', 'given', 'adapt', 'when', 'enthusiastic', 'checkroom', 'girl', 'named', 'Mildred', 'Atkinson', 'played', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'book', 'possiblilty', 'movie', 'based', 'Dix', 'job', 'coming', 'back', 'apartment', 'read', 'tome', 'so', 'might', 'have', 'idea', 'book', 'exerting', 'undue', 'effort.So', 'check', 'room', 'girl', 'date', 'banker', 'boyfriend', 'Dix', 'courtyard', 'apartment', 'dig', 'book', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'too', 'well', 'Dix', 'girl', 'money', 'cabfare', 'home', 'looking', 'bone', 'tired', 'going', 'bed.Next', 'thing', '5', 'AM', 'old', 'army', 'buddy', 'now', 'plainclothes', 'detective', 'well', 'played', 'Frank', 'Lovejoy', 'ringing', 'doorbell', 'wanting', 'talk', 'about', 'Mildred', 'Atkinson', 'out', 'was', 'murdered', 'could', 'get', 'cab', 'Dix', 'was', 'last', 'known', 'person', 'have', 'seen', 'alive.While', 'being', 'questioned', 'station', 'house', 'Dix', 'police', 'question', 'one', 'person', 'did', 'see', 'when', 'said', 'goodnight', 'Mildred', 'Atkinson', 'woman', 'who', 'courtyard', 'out', 'woman', 'Laurel', 'Gray', 'played', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'taken', 'notice', 'Dix', 'aware', 'screenwriter.As', 'film', 'so', 'relationship', 'Dixon', 'Steele', 'Laurel', 'Gray', 'seem', 'get', 'along', 'well', 'screenplay', 'lot', 'help', 'apparently.At', 'times', 'Dix', 'everything', 'outside', 'world', 'mind', 'strictly', 'involved', 'writing', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'years', 'lot', 'do', 'Laurel', 'keeping', 'mind', 'track', 'story.But', 'occassionally', 'violent', 'incident', 'will', 'occur', 'sometimes', 'Laurel', 'witness', 'it.In', 'meantime', 'police', 'investigation', 'be', 'progressing', 'slowly', 'Dix', 'still', 'primary', 'suspect', 'Sometimes', 'Laurel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'evidence', 'Dix', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'nature', 'one', 'who', 'killed', 'MIldred', 'Atkinson.In', 'fact', 'noirish', 'part', 'story', 'enjoy', 'most', 'audience', 'left', 'wondering', 'Dixon', 'Steele', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'kids', 'cut-down', 'cars', 'how', 'would', 'Dix', 'react', 'actual', 'turndown', 'young', 'pretty', 'girl', 'Especially', 'couple', 'drinks', 'would', 'take', 'personal', 'insult', 'something', 'had', 'be', 'avenged', 'immediately', 'crux', 'decision', 'Laurel', 'make', 'Dix', '..and', 'decision', 'audience', 'make', 'Dixon', 'Steele', 'entire', 'story', 'IN', 'A', 'LONELY', 'PLACE.It', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'murder', 'mystery', 'plenty', 'noir', 'trappings', 'thrown', 'not', 'just', 'confuse', 'characters', 'hold', 'audience', 'gloomy', 'cloud', 'suspense', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'fine', 'job', 'byeveryone', 'involved', 'A', 'LONELY', 'PLACE', 'memorable', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'hold', 'interest', 'say', 'least', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'born', 'when', 'kissed', 'me.I', 'died', 'when', 'left', 'me.I', 'lived', 'few', 'weeks', 'loved', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Dixon', 'Steele', 'A', 'LONELY', 'PLACE', '1950']",In a Lonely Place VHS

He also physically attacked one of his girlfriends.  Bogart won applause from the men who served under him in World War Two, including Frank Lovejoy, who is later put in the position of investigating his former commanding officer as a Beverly Hills policeman.Bogart lives in an apartment with a courtyard view.  Across that courtyard is the apartment of Grahame.  He is able to observe her actions when their windows are open, reminiscent of Burt Lancaster watching Susan Sarandon in &quot;Atlantic City.&quot;  When they strike up a romance Bogart feels an infusion of life that propels him to greater efforts as a screenwriter.  Grahame, a struggling actress, helps out by typing pages he has finished in longhand.This is film noir, however, and not a &quot;they lived happy ever after&quot; scenario.  Bogart is a passionate man and the violent side remains within him.  He is being investigated as a possible killer of a hatcheck girl he has brought home from the restaurant-nightclub he frequents to provide him with background abut a novel he wishes to avoid reading, but is being asked to adapt to a screenplay.  When she is found dead not long after leaving Bogart's apartment, suspicion abounds at the Beverly Hills Police Station, given his violent past.  Old foxhole mate Lovejoy argues on Bogart's behalf that he is innocent.Eventually Bogart's romance with Grahame and his status as a murder suspect reach a simultaneous crescendo.  There are two murder suspects, Bogart and the deceased woman's fiance.  Grahame, while feeling great affection for Bogart, is well aware of his violent side, which even Bogart's agent believes will never terminate.  He would like a marriage and children.  Will she take the risk?It is fascinating to see how the two major plot points of this hard hitting, bruisingly realistic movie are resolved.  The story resolutions are deftly handled with an ironic twist at the film's conclusion.",5,A Rebel of Night,1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,2742,"['Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'familiar', 'metier', 'rebellious', 'loner', 'who', 'night', 'quot', 'Lonely', 'Place.', 'quot', 'perfect', 'match', 'director', 'Nicholas', 'Ray', 'finest', 'films', 'dealt', 'rebels', 'night', 'such', 'quot', 'Live', 'Night', 'quot', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'subject', 'rebellious', 'youth', 'James', 'Dean', 'most', 'overpowering', 'quot', 'Rebel', 'Cause.', 'quot', 'Bogart', 'finest', 'work', 'same', 'applies', 'leading', 'lady', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'marriage', 'director', 'Ray', 'was', 'final', 'stages', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made.Bogart', 'Dix', 'Steele', 'who', 'immersed', 'physical', 'violence', 'taking', 'toll', 'career', 'screenwriter', 'evidenced', 'fact', 'attacked', 'injured', 'producer', 'one', 'films', 'was', 'working', 'also', 'physically', 'attacked', 'one', 'girlfriends', 'Bogart', 'won', 'applause', 'men', 'who', 'served', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'including', 'Frank', 'Lovejoy', 'who', 'later', 'put', 'position', 'investigating', 'former', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'policeman.Bogart', 'apartment', 'courtyard', 'view', 'courtyard', 'apartment', 'Grahame', 'able', 'observe', 'actions', 'when', 'windows', 'are', 'open', 'reminiscent', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'watching', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'quot', 'Atlantic', 'City.', 'quot', 'When', 'strike', 'up', 'romance', 'Bogart', 'infusion', 'life', 'greater', 'efforts', 'screenwriter', 'Grahame', 'struggling', 'actress', 'out', 'typing', 'pages', 'finished', 'longhand.This', 'film', 'noir', 'however', 'not', 'quot', 'lived', 'happy', 'ever', 'quot', 'scenario', 'Bogart', 'passionate', 'man', 'violent', 'side', 'being', 'investigated', 'possible', 'killer', 'hatcheck', 'girl', 'brought', 'home', 'restaurant-nightclub', 'provide', 'background', 'abut', 'novel', 'avoid', 'reading', 'being', 'asked', 'adapt', 'screenplay', 'When', 'found', 'dead', 'not', 'long', 'leaving', 'Bogart', 'apartment', 'suspicion', 'abounds', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Police', 'Station', 'given', 'violent', 'past', 'Old', 'foxhole', 'mate', 'Lovejoy', 'Bogart', 'behalf', 'innocent.Eventually', 'Bogart', 'romance', 'Grahame', 'status', 'murder', 'suspect', 'reach', 'simultaneous', 'crescendo', 'are', 'two', 'murder', 'suspects', 'Bogart', 'deceased', 'woman', 'fiance', 'Grahame', 'feeling', 'great', 'affection', 'Bogart', 'well', 'aware', 'violent', 'side', 'even', 'Bogart', 'agent', 'will', 'never', 'terminate', 'would', 'like', 'marriage', 'children', 'Will', 'take', 'risk', 'fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'two', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'hard', 'hitting', 'bruisingly', 'realistic', 'movie', 'are', 'resolved', 'story', 'resolutions', 'are', 'deftly', 'handled', 'ironic', 'twist', 'film', 'conclusion']",In a Lonely Place VHS
