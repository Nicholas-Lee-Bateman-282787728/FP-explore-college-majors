1173766,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B001C0JROC,Anthony Pittore,"[13, 14]","When six high schoolers skip school to play in the woods, they come across a mysterious drifter named Peter (Kevin Howarth). At first, all goes smoothly as Peter joins in with the kids' games. Soon, however, he turns and begins to play with the kids in more twisted ways. As the day progresses, Peter starts playing his own games. . . until he goes too far. . .This really is a difficult film on which to comment. From one view, it seems that it's a very uneventful story about a crazy guy screwing with some kids. On the other hand, however, it's an interesting and chilling look into a madman toying dangerously with a group of adolescents in order to teach them a series of lessons. 'Summer Scars' will definitely the type of film that will evenly divide the viewing base between boredom and intrigue, but I'm definitely leaning towards the intrigue. When looking at the film from a technical point of view, it's very good. The script is fantastic, though, as I said, seemingly uneventful. The dialogue flows well and maintains a steady realism throughout, and the realism is enhanced by some good performances from the kids and a great performance from Kevin Howarth (from director Julian Richards's previous film The Last Horror Movie). The direction & cinematography utilize the forest setting well and, even when the group is just sitting around for a period of time, never rests with exploring the area visually. Adding to the atmosphere visually, the lack of a soundtrack really helps to keep things downbeat and believable (think No Country for Old Men). On a deeper level, the film attempts to play almost like a real-world fairy tale. . . do something wrong, reap the consequences, but still come out better (mentally) when it's all finished. In the end, 'Summer Scars' is not for those looking for a plot-driven film with any real amount of action. It's a character-driven thriller that toys with the minds of the youth (and the viewers) and focuses more on lessons of morality than violence and action. If that's what you want, give this one a look.Final Verdict: 7/10.-AP3-",4,Strangely unsettling look into the minds of youths,1225497600,"11 1, 2008",2008,2088,"['When', 'six', 'high', 'schoolers', 'skip', 'school', 'play', 'woods', 'come', 'mysterious', 'drifter', 'named', 'Peter', 'Kevin', 'Howarth', 'first', 'smoothly', 'Peter', 'kids', 'games', 'Soon', 'however', 'play', 'kids', 'more', 'twisted', 'ways', 'day', 'Peter', 'playing', 'own', 'games', 'too', 'far', '.This', 'really', 'difficult', 'film', 'comment', 'one', 'view', 'very', 'uneventful', 'story', 'crazy', 'guy', 'screwing', 'kids', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'interesting', 'chilling', 'look', 'madman', 'toying', 'dangerously', 'group', 'adolescents', 'order', 'teach', 'series', 'lessons', ""'Summer"", 'Scars', 'will', 'definitely', 'type', 'film', 'will', 'evenly', 'divide', 'viewing', 'base', 'boredom', 'intrigue', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'leaning', 'intrigue', 'When', 'looking', 'film', 'technical', 'point', 'view', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'fantastic', 'though', 'said', 'seemingly', 'uneventful', 'dialogue', 'well', 'steady', 'realism', 'realism', 'enhanced', 'good', 'performances', 'kids', 'great', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Howarth', 'director', 'Julian', 'Richards', 'previous', 'film', 'Last', 'Horror', 'Movie', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'utilize', 'forest', 'setting', 'well', 'even', 'when', 'group', 'just', 'sitting', 'around', 'period', 'time', 'never', 'exploring', 'area', 'visually', 'Adding', 'atmosphere', 'visually', 'lack', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'keep', 'things', 'downbeat', 'believable', 'think', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'deeper', 'level', 'film', 'attempts', 'play', 'almost', 'real-world', 'fairy', 'tale', 'do', 'something', 'wrong', 'reap', 'consequences', 'still', 'come', 'out', 'better', 'mentally', 'when', 'finished', 'end', 'Scars', 'not', 'looking', 'plot-driven', 'film', 'real', 'amount', 'action', 'character-driven', 'thriller', 'minds', 'youth', 'viewers', 'more', 'lessons', 'morality', 'violence', 'action', 'what', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'look.Final', 'Verdict', '7/10.-AP3-']",Summer Scars

Plot is basically about a group of kids with bad attitudes who encounter an old creepy guy in the woods.

I would tell anyone to buy this movie. It is about a group of kids who go into the woods only to find a man who is crazy off the wall. He is a control freak who wants to make the teens do things his way and only his way. The group is made up of all boys and one girl and towards the end it is a little creepy at what he made them do. I gave it a five star rating and would buy it again. I don't want to give anything away about the substance of the movie but I don't think you would be disappointed in purchasing it for you dvd collection.",5,summer Scars,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,669,"['was', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'had', 'action', 'drama', 'anything', 'else', 'may', 'look', 'movie', 'would', 'tell', 'anyone', 'buy', 'movie', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'go', 'woods', 'only', 'find', 'man', 'who', 'crazy', 'wall', 'control', 'freak', 'who', 'make', 'teens', 'do', 'things', 'way', 'only', 'way', 'group', 'made', 'boys', 'one', 'girl', 'end', 'little', 'creepy', 'what', 'made', 'do', 'gave', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'buy', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'substance', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'purchasing', 'dvd', 'collection']",Summer Scars
1173769,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B001C0JROC,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","When a group of friends in Wales decide to cut school and hang out in the woods, they meet a drifter who will change their lives in the shocking true story, Summer Scars. Writer/Director Julian Richards claims that this actually happened to him as a child. At 67 minutes long, this is one of the shortest films you will ever see and still it felt like it was too long. What happened was unique and defiantly worthy of a film, but it seems to me like Richards decided to tell the entire truth of what happened in painstaking detail. What this film needed was some fiction thrown in to make the story more interesting and to space out the events of what happened. As for the cast, it was almost completely full of newcomers, some of which were horrible, but others like Darren Evans, showed some real skill and a bright future. The only veteran actor was Kevin Howarth, who played the drifter and he was terrific. The veteran horror actor really showed us in a short period of time, what this guy must have really been like and he was really amazing. It's the performances of Howarth and Evans that make this short, creepy film worth watching. Summer Scars was an interesting story, but jumped around so much and had a hard time finding direction. For long periods of time nothing happens, but when it finally does, it comes at you so quickly that you're just confused. I liked this film, but with the story they had to go with, if they had had a better cast, and spread things out a little more, Summer Scars could have been so much more than it was.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,1549,"['When', 'group', 'friends', 'Wales', 'decide', 'cut', 'school', 'hang', 'out', 'woods', 'meet', 'drifter', 'who', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'shocking', 'true', 'story', 'Summer', 'Scars', 'Writer/Director', 'Julian', 'Richards', 'actually', 'happened', 'child', '67', 'minutes', 'long', 'one', 'shortest', 'films', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'What', 'happened', 'was', 'unique', 'defiantly', 'worthy', 'film', 'Richards', 'decided', 'tell', 'entire', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'What', 'film', 'needed', 'was', 'fiction', 'thrown', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'space', 'out', 'events', 'what', 'happened', 'cast', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'full', 'newcomers', 'were', 'horrible', 'others', 'Darren', 'Evans', 'showed', 'real', 'skill', 'bright', 'future', 'only', 'veteran', 'actor', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Howarth', 'who', 'played', 'drifter', 'was', 'terrific', 'veteran', 'horror', 'actor', 'really', 'showed', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'what', 'guy', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'was', 'really', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Howarth', 'Evans', 'make', 'short', 'creepy', 'film', 'watching', 'Summer', 'Scars', 'was', 'interesting', 'story', 'jumped', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'direction', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'nothing', 'happens', 'when', 'finally', 'so', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'just', 'confused', 'liked', 'film', 'story', 'had', 'go', 'had', 'had', 'better', 'cast', 'spread', 'things', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'Summer', 'Scars', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'was']",Summer Scars
1173770,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B001C0JROC,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","Yes that is the basic synopsis of this independent Welsh Film. It is directed by Julian Richard and stars his friend Kevin Howarth as Peter an ex soldier who has `life coping' issues and appears to be living rough in the woods.Our ne'er do well kids are all bunking off school and have agreed to meet up for a wasted day of `hanging' in the aforementioned woods. On the way the only member of the group who is female Leanne steals a scooter. On arrival it is taken for a `joyride' by would be alpha male Paul. He has a disabled brother who he is carrying everywhere and decides to take him for a ride too. On the way they hit Peter and bravely run off.Peter awakens and tracks them down, he then decides that he quite likes the company and from that moment on he sort of takes control.This is really not a horror film but more a psychological thriller or study into mental illness. The children all do quite brilliant jobs of acting and come across as surprisingly believable for such a small budget effort. There is no real gore, but despite that the threat of violence or worse is an ever constant presence and that has to be attributable to the performance of Kevin Howarth.The music is ok with quite a bit of (c)rap music at the beginning. The ending may not be totally satisfying, but this is more about the journey than the destination as all good films should be. It is also not long with a run time just under seventy minutes. All in all a very good effort, but it is still just 4 stars and is one of those films where nothing more will be garnered from subsequent viewings, but worth giving a go once any way if only for supporting indie Welsh cinema.",4,Welsh Kids Meet Nutter in Woods and Bad Stuff Happens!,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,1660,"['Yes', 'basic', 'synopsis', 'independent', 'Welsh', 'Film', 'directed', 'Julian', 'Richard', 'friend', 'Kevin', 'Howarth', 'Peter', 'ex', 'soldier', 'who', 'life', 'coping', 'issues', 'be', 'living', 'rough', 'woods.Our', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'kids', 'are', 'bunking', 'off', 'school', 'have', 'agreed', 'meet', 'up', 'wasted', 'day', 'hanging', 'aforementioned', 'woods', 'way', 'only', 'member', 'group', 'who', 'female', 'Leanne', 'scooter', 'arrival', 'taken', 'joyride', 'would', 'be', 'alpha', 'male', 'Paul', 'disabled', 'brother', 'who', 'carrying', 'everywhere', 'take', 'ride', 'too', 'way', 'hit', 'Peter', 'bravely', 'run', 'off.Peter', 'awakens', 'down', 'then', 'quite', 'company', 'moment', 'sort', 'control.This', 'really', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'study', 'mental', 'illness', 'children', 'do', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'jobs', 'acting', 'come', 'surprisingly', 'believable', 'such', 'small', 'budget', 'effort', 'real', 'gore', 'threat', 'violence', 'worse', 'ever', 'constant', 'presence', 'be', 'attributable', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Howarth.The', 'music', 'ok', 'quite', 'bit', 'c', 'rap', 'music', 'beginning', 'ending', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'totally', 'satisfying', 'more', 'journey', 'destination', 'good', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'also', 'not', 'long', 'run', 'time', 'just', 'seventy', 'minutes', 'very', 'good', 'effort', 'still', 'just', '4', 'stars', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'nothing', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'garnered', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'worth', 'giving', 'go', 'once', 'way', 'only', 'supporting', 'indie', 'Welsh', 'cinema']",Summer Scars
