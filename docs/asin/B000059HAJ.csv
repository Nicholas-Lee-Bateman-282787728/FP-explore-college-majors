Of course I'm only a die hard fan of the original first few seasons, up to space.  Well, turbo was disappointing but...anyway the movies are nice, though I'm annoyed w/ dbl sided discs like this.  Anyway the 1st movie is the best, totally kicks, and is what all power rangers is about.  The second was less satisfying, and while I don't really find Justin annoying or not, they could have done better.  So yeah, for power ranger fans this is great.  Now if they'd only release season box sets, I'd be in total morphanominal heaven!",5,Die hard fan still!,1064966400,"10 1, 2003",2003,604,"['Okay', ""'m"", '18', 'most', 'say', 'too', 'old', 'enjoy', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'who', 'course', ""'m"", 'only', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'original', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'up', 'space', 'Well', 'turbo', 'was', 'disappointing', 'anyway', 'movies', 'are', 'nice', ""'m"", 'annoyed', 'w/', 'dbl', 'sided', 'discs', 'Anyway', '1st', 'movie', 'best', 'totally', 'kicks', 'what', 'power', 'rangers', 'about', 'second', 'was', 'less', 'satisfying', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'Justin', 'annoying', 'not', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'So', 'yeah', 'power', 'ranger', 'fans', 'great', 'Now', ""'d"", 'only', 'release', 'season', 'box', 'sets', ""'d"", 'be', 'total', 'morphanominal', 'heaven']",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie / Turbo - A Power Rangers Movie

The first movie was cool and the story to get their new powers was really cool too but it's sort of a shame that the whole movie was a waste in a way. The movie didn't have anything to do with the show. What I mean is that if you were to watch this movie and then watched the show it wouldn't have mattered. Unlike the second movie which you HAD to see. After the first movie came out the television series HAD to have a different story for how the rangers got the Ninja powers. As everyone knows the TV show orignally came from Japan and all the clips in the show with the rangers fighting and the Zords were almost all from the Japan series. The movie on the other hand was made in America and wasn't a Japanese based film.Some people don't understand why the movie version couldn't have been the way the rangers got the powers. Well that version is not the correct way they got them. The show's way was the true version and the movies way was just the USA's way of getting of getting money.The second movie on the other hand had to be seen to understand the Turbo season and why Rocky wasn't the blue ranger anymore. The movie is good but it doesn't compare to the first but that is expected because the Turbo movie was set right into the plot of the show and not some other plot. The second movie uses the real command center, Zords, and weapons which is a let down b/c the first movies command center was awesome but once again this movie was based on the show totally. If you've never seen the second movie and are a fan of the orignial show then you'll like this movie for two former power rangers make an appearance in the movie.The first movie had a cool new look, the second movie could've been shown one afternoon on Fox Kids when it first came out since it looked so much like the show. Well anyways I know it seems like I put both movies down but if you really like the original show you will really like these movies!",5,Good movies but only one went with story line of show,1010966400,"01 14, 2002",2002,2054,"['first', 'movie', 'everyone', 'who', 'wathced', 'original', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'say', 'Power', 'Rangers', '90', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'cool', 'story', 'get', 'new', 'powers', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'too', 'sort', 'shame', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'waste', 'way', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'show', 'What', 'mean', 'were', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'watched', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'mattered', 'second', 'movie', 'HAD', 'see', 'first', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'television', 'series', 'HAD', 'have', 'different', 'story', 'how', 'rangers', 'got', 'Ninja', 'powers', 'everyone', 'TV', 'show', 'orignally', 'came', 'Japan', 'clips', 'show', 'rangers', 'fighting', 'Zords', 'were', 'almost', 'Japan', 'series', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'made', 'America', 'was', ""n't"", 'Japanese', 'based', 'film.Some', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'version', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'way', 'rangers', 'got', 'powers', 'Well', 'version', 'not', 'correct', 'way', 'got', 'show', 'way', 'was', 'true', 'version', 'movies', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'USA', 'way', 'getting', 'getting', 'money.The', 'second', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'had', 'be', 'seen', 'understand', 'Turbo', 'season', 'why', 'Rocky', 'was', ""n't"", 'blue', 'ranger', 'anymore', 'movie', 'good', ""n't"", 'compare', 'first', 'expected', 'Turbo', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'right', 'plot', 'show', 'not', 'other', 'plot', 'second', 'movie', 'real', 'command', 'center', 'Zords', 'weapons', 'let', 'down', 'b/c', 'first', 'movies', 'command', 'center', 'was', 'awesome', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'show', 'totally', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'second', 'movie', 'are', 'fan', 'orignial', 'show', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'two', 'former', 'power', 'rangers', 'make', 'appearance', 'movie.The', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'cool', 'new', 'look', 'second', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shown', 'one', 'afternoon', 'Fox', 'Kids', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'looked', 'so', 'much', 'show', 'Well', 'know', 'put', 'movies', 'down', 'really', 'original', 'show', 'will', 'really', 'like', 'movies']",Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie / Turbo - A Power Rangers Movie
