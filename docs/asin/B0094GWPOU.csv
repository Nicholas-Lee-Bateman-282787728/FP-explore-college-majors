1585191,AM18CU72YEWH5,B0094GWPOU,A. J Terry,"[317, 323]","I was especially interested in The Bletchley Circle because my mother was a code breaker for the US counterpart. Unlike the British protagonists, who for security reasons are required to tell everyone (even their husbands) that they did only ""clerical work"" during the war, my mother was allowed to state her occupation, although without many details. She did convey to me the intellectual challenges, the excitement, the camaraderie, and the feeling of making a valuable contribution that pervaded the large room where the code breakers worked long hours, just as in this movie.  Like the protagonist Susan, my mother was extremely good at anagrams, crosswords, and other puzzles, but complained that the vast majority of those published were not hard enough. She also loved to read murder mysteries.However, my mother returned to her academic career, whereas Susan has dutifully become a housewife. By 1952, Susan loves her husband and her two small children, she does her best, but she's bored. She becomes obsessed with a serial killer whose murders of young women are regularly reported in the newspapers.  She tries to determine the killer's schedule, his geographic patterns as he moves around the country, his modus operandi, and his motives. The police have arrested a different man every time, and she's sure those suspects were framed by the real killer. Susan cannot solve the mystery alone, so she recruits her three closest colleagues from Bletchley: Millie, Lucy, and Jean. Millie's strength is research (she's now a librarian), Lucy has an eidetic memory, and Jean is tough and slightly shady, meaning she buys and sells things, including handguns, on the black market.In some ways this is a typical thriller. The women discover the killer's identity, but are frustrated by Scotland Yard's refusal to listen to female amateurs. Susan takes the lead, becoming the most visible person in the group. As she gets closer to the killer, he gets closer to her, menacing not only Susan but her family. Considering that Susan is not only brilliant but normally sensible, her at times reckless behavior seems improbable. However, the killer is the most challenging intellectual opponent Susan has had for seven years. The conflict between her role as female and housewife, versus her independence and her intellectual needs, is underscored by her husband's periodic commands to stop what she's doing ""whatever it is.""I don't know whether the team of female detectives will return for a second season, but I certainly hope so. My mother would have loved this series too.",5,"Almost too thrilling, and wonderful period details",1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,2575,"['was', 'especially', 'interested', 'Bletchley', 'Circle', 'mother', 'was', 'code', 'breaker', 'US', 'counterpart', 'British', 'protagonists', 'who', 'security', 'reasons', 'are', 'required', 'tell', 'everyone', 'even', 'husbands', 'did', 'only', 'clerical', 'work', 'war', 'mother', 'was', 'allowed', 'state', 'occupation', 'many', 'details', 'did', 'convey', 'intellectual', 'challenges', 'excitement', 'camaraderie', 'feeling', 'making', 'valuable', 'contribution', 'pervaded', 'large', 'room', 'where', 'code', 'breakers', 'worked', 'long', 'hours', 'just', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'Susan', 'mother', 'was', 'extremely', 'good', 'anagrams', 'crosswords', 'other', 'puzzles', 'complained', 'vast', 'majority', 'published', 'were', 'not', 'hard', 'enough', 'also', 'loved', 'read', 'murder', 'mysteries.However', 'mother', 'returned', 'academic', 'career', 'whereas', 'Susan', 'dutifully', 'become', 'housewife', '1952', 'Susan', 'husband', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'best', 'bored', 'obsessed', 'serial', 'killer', 'murders', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'regularly', 'reported', 'newspapers', 'determine', 'killer', 'schedule', 'geographic', 'patterns', 'country', 'modus', 'operandi', 'motives', 'police', 'have', 'arrested', 'different', 'man', 'time', 'sure', 'suspects', 'were', 'framed', 'real', 'killer', 'Susan', 'can', 'not', 'solve', 'mystery', 'alone', 'three', 'closest', 'colleagues', 'Bletchley', 'Millie', 'Lucy', 'Jean', 'Millie', 'strength', 'research', 'now', 'librarian', 'Lucy', 'eidetic', 'memory', 'Jean', 'tough', 'slightly', 'shady', 'meaning', 'things', 'including', 'handguns', 'black', 'market.In', 'ways', 'typical', 'thriller', 'women', 'killer', 'identity', 'are', 'frustrated', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'refusal', 'listen', 'female', 'amateurs', 'Susan', 'lead', 'becoming', 'most', 'visible', 'person', 'group', 'closer', 'killer', 'closer', 'menacing', 'not', 'only', 'Susan', 'family', 'Considering', 'Susan', 'not', 'only', 'brilliant', 'normally', 'sensible', 'times', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'improbable', 'However', 'killer', 'most', 'challenging', 'intellectual', 'opponent', 'Susan', 'had', 'seven', 'years', 'conflict', 'role', 'female', 'housewife', 'independence', 'intellectual', 'needs', 'underscored', 'husband', 'periodic', 'commands', 'stop', 'what', 'doing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'team', 'female', 'detectives', 'will', 'return', 'second', 'season', 'certainly', 'hope', 'so', 'mother', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'series', 'too']","The Bletchley Circle NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

As good as this outing is, I'm not quite as in love with it as most viewers appear to be.Here's the scoop. There are 4 women working for the British military as code breakers during WWII. Each has a specific talent and they prove themselves to be very good at what they do. Now it is peacetime. Their lives are more mundane and they are prohibited from divulging the work they did during the war. They miss the sense of urgency and importance. One of the women, Susan, becomes intrigued by the apparent presence of a serial killer in London and figures she can solve the case. But she needs the help of her old mates to do so and it's off to the races.I enjoyed this very much. I liked the period detail and the fact that they cast Anna Maxwell Martin in the role of Susan. She's a bit on the mousey side. In Hollywood they would have cast a glamor queen. The writing was uneven. Many of the plot points involving the detective work were quite clever. Other plot points, particularly those involving the girls' lives, were pedestrian. There was little there you haven't seen before, while other aspects of their lives needed fleshing out.I don't want to take too much away from this. The basic idea is clever and the girls working the case felt true. The writer, Guy Burk, seems to have done his homework on code breaking. You can't make this stuff up. Overall, a nice effort.

The writing was tight and the female characters were interesting, especially in how the show portrayed their interactions and support of each other.Four women have grown apart since the war ended, when one of them gets interested in the murder of a woman.  She uses her mental skills in connecting the dots to realize that there is a serial killer on the loose and that the police have no clues.  She tries to approach them and you then discover that, despite her rather mousy little life as a 1950s housewife, that she used to work in a top secret position during the War and broke code.  Even her husband knows nothing about it.  She then hooks up with her other former-friends who were part of the secret codebreaking and they use their skills and talents to uncover the murderer.The dissonance between what these women did and the lives they were leading after the war was fascinating.  It really highlighted the times and how they felt they had no choice but to hide who they were and what they could do in order to fit in.  The relationships between the four women is wonderful to watch, including how they support each other and how their talents mesh.Great show.

Their work actually predicted through code breaking an invasion taking place in 3 days. Heros all.9 years pass and one of the code breakers is following an article in the papers about at least 5 women  brutily tortured and murdered. She decides to solve the murders by using her unique skills in problem solving. She also realizes she will need help. This is where the 3 other women from the Bletchley Park days each having a unique talent necessary in the solving of these crimes. End of part 2.The last part of the series reveals more of these womens peronalities , skills and personal lives. They tackle the case ,identify possible suspects and bring this info to Scotland yard.

It also sublimely shows how difficult it is to go from saving lives and winning battles, to being an &#34;everyday woman&#34; in early 1950s England. As with all of those working in such missions in the war effort, they had to sign a silence/secrecy agreement so that one of the four women has never even been able to tell her husband what she did during the war, and, yet he knows his wife if keeping 'something' from him and eventually it puts a strain on their relationship.The best part about this series is that it shows how smart women can be in both math and logistics and one of the youngest of the group has a photographic memory - which can be incredibly helpful but at times very difficult for her. It is also set apart from other similar type television genres by the unique way each woman is able to use her war experience at Bletchley to solve whatever mystery or case they are working on.

There has been a spate of murders of young women, and former Bletchley Park code breaker now housewife, Susan, thinks she detects a pattern.She convinces her husband, who doesn't know of her past as a code breaker, to visit Scotland Yard with her to tell them that there is a victim they haven't discovered, based upon the pattern of the killer. When no victim turns up, and Scotland Yard dismisses her, Susan turns to three female code breakers with whom she worked at Bletchley Park during WWII, to see if they will contribute their formidable talents to preventing a future murder.While there is trepidation at first, the quartet is on the scent of the killer, discerning patterns and predicting next steps. The joy of this series is in the distinct character of the four women, the synergy and chemistry they have together, the period details of architecture, autos, custom and fashion.

1585308,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0094GWPOU,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","""The Bletchley Circle"" is a period mystery that capitalizes on the intrigue surrounding codebreaking during World War II and the social upheavals that followed the War. In 1952, Susan Gray (Anna Maxwell Martin) is a comfortable middle-class London housewife. Increasingly bored with housework and knitting, Susan has been following a series of murders that she believes exhibit a pattern. A serial killer is murdering young women in darkened rooms underground. Susan presents her theory to Deputy Commissioner Wainwright (Michael Gould) of the London police but is disappointed to find her predictions wrong. Undeterred, she asks Millie (Rachael Sterling), an old colleague from her war years at Bletchley Park, to help. Millie thinks they need more data and more help, so they enlist two other former colleagues: Jean (Julie Graham), a research librarian, and Lucy (Sophie Rundle), who possesses an eidetic memory, to track down the killer before he kills again.This is a female twist on a ""getting the gang back together"" after the war plot. Instead of being soldiers, these four women worked at the famous Bletchley Park HQ, where British cryptanalysts cracked the German Enigma cipher. The movie opens with a brief scene of the women working together at Bletchley Park. Although women did outnumber men by a considerable margin at Bletchley Park, there were very few female cryptanalysts, and it's never clear to me exactly what job the movie is assigning these women. They rely on their wartime skills to understand the murderer and predict his actions. This mostly has to do with mathematical data analysis. They are successful, because this serial killer is far more methodical than most. The pressure on the women is increased by the overzealous Official Secrets Act that forbade them from even mentioning where they worked during the War. As a result, Susan can't show her husband that she's not a dunce.The serial killer is in the pervert mold that has become a staple of British murder mysteries. Nothing interesting or believable there. The period sets, costumes, manners, and lovely photography do a great deal to make ""The Bletchley Circle"" enjoyable, though. London is always dreary and evenly lit. Indoor lighting is a mixture of daylight and tungsten, which produces a dull, soothing shade. Much has been made of the feminine character of this miniseries and the women's struggle to be taken seriously by authorities. But, as they couldn't say anything about their qualifications, and Susan's initial hunches were wrong, I can't say that the police acted any differently than they would now or than they would toward men. To me, the feature that sets ""The Bletchley Circle"" apart from most television mysteries being made today is that the detectives are not neurotic. Most TV detectives are more dysfunctional than the criminals.

A serial killer catches the attention of this group and they start tracking him in ways most of us would never think of...and they are not successful at first as women keep disappearing. They rethink what the pattern means and get it right...it is fascinating watching how math and patterns and probability all work to catch this monster....very clever against the male bastions of Scotland Yard..LOVED it.

Just to be clear--a woman lead does not have to be  &#34;beautiful&#34; in a Hollywood sense, but if she is the lead character of a band of sisters, it would be helpful she had a little more &#34;force&#34; or &#34;power&#34; so that we understood why the sisters were following her into danger.  This may be a problem of the dialogue and plot, however, rather than the actress.But this first season was more potential than actuality.

1585328,A1EUI8FA4KNV95,B0094GWPOU,Rissi,"[43, 44]","When the masterful 2005 version of Bleak House premiered on Masterpiece Theatre, we were all introduced to the talents of Anna Maxwell Martin. She starred as the orphaned, ill-treated Esther who finally found purpose at Bleak House before going on to star in a number of smaller roles. Now she has been restored as a leading lady - and she does it all rather marvelously in this ""adult"" three-part mini-series.Ordinary is not a word one could ascribe to Susan (Martin). She loves puzzles and cannot seem to shut off her brain no matter how hard she tries - when there's a riddle, she must solve it. Some nine years after WWII, that is exactly what Susan is living: an ordinary life with two children and a husband whose career is on the brink of brilliant success. As a code-cracker during the war, Susan was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement and has kept her work a secret but now there have been a string of horrible murders and by powers of deduction, she's come up with information that could aid the police in their investigations. When the information turns out to produce no results, Susan reaches out to her former colleagues in Lucy (Sophie Rundle), Millie (Rachel Stirling) and Jean (Julie Graham), all of whom are living simpler lives now. Lucy is involved in an unhealthy relationship and Millie is hurt by Susan's dismissal of their friendship, having once promised her that she'd never allow Susan to be ""ordinary""; the girls had grand adventures planned before Susan fell into marital life.Skeptical to hear out Susan's plans, the girls eventually band together, knowing there is more to Susan's patterns than anyone is willing to notice. They use their training and any resources they can find to follow the serial killer's path. Clues that may lead them right to his doorstep - and possibly endanger their own lives.One day during my on-line browsing, I happened upon this series and was drawn to it for a pair of reasons. For obvious reasons, the first was its leading lady and then I became interested after references were made to the brilliant Foyle's War in other's reviews. To judge the series by that original Anthony Horowitz penned script may not be fair but it certainly has similarities while holding its own, proving that it is just as exciting, clever and addicting in ways that are unique to its own style. The only flaw in the otherwise spotless scripting is that the series spans a mere three one-hour episode run and there have been no plans to produce more. That is enough to earn a sad face from me.Restricting my thoughts to only this genre, I am not sure that since Foyle's War, I've met a cast of such fabulous characterizations. It was more fun than I expected to follow these women as they deduced and sought clues to put away a murderer and try to convince the police of their findings in the meantime. Like her prior roles, Anna Maxwell Martin was a fantastic leading lady. She manages to play each character with a quiet grace and the role of Susan is no different. She's compassionate and yet elicits sympathy from us for her apparent inability to calm her busy mind and desire to want to do something that matters. What she doesn't realize is that to her children, just being their ""mummy"" is enough. Her personality doesn't let her enjoy normalcy and yet, we don't doubt that she loves her family. Behind the apparent, she's an interesting character and one that could have been written even more complicated should producers ever see the merit in making the premise a serial. Each of the women has a specialty in their field which makes it easy to distinguish who plays what role in their crime-solving ""book club.""Though the audience had more to go on than some mysteries, I was impressed how well writer's strung along the viewers with clues. More is revealed than we might expect before the end but it did not detract from the thrill of the chase or seeing the killer brought to justice. There was excitement and danger in the course of one scene and it felt like an enigma that deserved more than an hour to solve. As a story, `Circle' works well, but there are a few places that it lags in pacing though during its majority, three hours was filled nicely and never seemed to fall into being boring or come across as time used poorly in the capacity of a premise that is all too often abused. Filming and staging is equally impressive building suspense when it should and displaying character's lighter sides when the time is right. Unfortunately, The Bletchley Circle is not all ""good."" The premise may be written with precision but in all honesty, it travels down some dark places. The criminal mastermind is not a pleasant place to be yet this British (ITV) produced show has found a compatible balance much like predecessors have. Even in the middle of thoughtless crimes, the characters are not forgotten and they make it jolly good fun.

1585330,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0094GWPOU,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","It has not been until recent years that the code of silence surrounding various groups and organizations that were at work during the Second World War has been lifted, allowing the next generation to learn just what their grandparents were up to whilst Hitler was on the rise. One such organization was located at Bletchley Park, the site of the United Kingdom's main decryption establishment, where various codes were cracked by a staff made up of 80% women. For decades after the end of the war they refused to divulge their secret work even to their nearest and dearest, and were altogether extraordinary women, who not only saved lives with their diligence but were also some of the world's first computer programmers.If anything, they've long been overdue a television show that focuses on their bravery and intelligence.So I must confess that I was initially rather disappointed that ""The Bletchley Circle"" is actually set nine years *after* the end of the war. I was under the impression that this was a show that focused on the lives of women during the war years and which explored their work at code-breaking.But it soon becomes clear that these characters' work during the war forms the basis of the show and still makes up a significant part of their lives. In 1952 Susan Grey is happily married with two children, though she misses the days in which she felt important and able to make an impact on the war effort on a regular basis. Following news of a series of murders on the radio, she believes she's spotted a pattern in the way the killer is targeting his victims. After the police can find no leads she turns instead to her old comrades of Bletchley Park.They are Millie, the vivacious but hard-done-by waitress, Jean, their former superior currently working as a librarian, and Lucy, a young wife with a photographic memory (which naturally comes in quite handy). Using their old contacts and some old-fashioned legwork, they put their minds together in order to catch the killer. No internet or databases for these women; they have to sit down for hours on end to trawl through information.But as they get closer to discovering the killer's identity, he begins to take a vested interest in them as well.""The Bletchley Circle"" is not only a riveting crime drama but a vivid portrait of life in the 1950s. Fashions, technology and attitudes are accurately rendered in order to really give you a sense of time and place. As you might imagine, the women come up against a fair amount of sexism over the course of their investigation, wherein various husbands, employers and police officers can be anything from condescending to bemused to annoyed at their antics. Yet none of them (apart from the killer of course) are grossly misogynistic, in fact some of them are deeply concerned for the safety of the women.On that note, there are thousands of films, books and television shows out there that depict male protagonists investigating a killer or undertaking some other dangerous mission, only to have his female love interest plead on behalf of his family that it's too dangerous to go out and do whatever brave thing he has in mind. It's a real treat to get a gender-flipped version of that old trope, in which a woman is torn between her duty to her family and her desperate desire to catch a killer and reclaim a sense of self.That goes for all the women, who are fantastic characters to spend time with: determined, vulnerable, diligent, fiercely intelligent and always lady-like.

Then we fast forward to 1952 London with the unsolved murders of 4 women making news headlines. Susan is one of the former code breakers and she discerns a pattern in these crimes and invites her 3 old friends to help. They are so successful in discerning patterns that they find the body of a 5th missing victim.They secretly continue on with their work and Susan and Lucy especially incur great personal danger as well as friction with their husbands because they cannot reveal what they are doing since their former work was classified Top Secret. Eventually they realize that the murderer had actually killed 12 women over the years and was clever enough to frame innocent men for many of those crimes. Suspense rises as the murderer realizes that they are closing in on him.The performers were excellent and the well written script provides a great mystery puzzle and also a story of friendship and self-sacrifice in the face of danger to help others. It is also quite apparent that the 4 former code breakers loved their work but suffered because they could never reveal this to anyone due to national security constraints.The Blu-ray video and audio quality is good, and the special features offered are Scene Selections and Interviews with the cast and crew.",5,Excellent 3 part mystery series,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,1735,"['review', 'Bletchley', 'Circle', 'Cracking', 'Killer', 'CodeFormat', 'Blu-ray', 'NTSCLanguage', 'EnglishRegion', 'Region', 'A/1Aspect', 'Ratio', '1.33:1Number', 'discs', '1Rated', 'NR', 'Not', 'Rated', 'Studio', 'Pbs', 'Direct', 'DVD', 'Release', 'Date', 'May', '14', '2013Run', 'Time', '180', 'minutesThis', 'excellent', '3', 'part', 'PBS', 'mystery', 'series.The', 'story', '1943', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'HQ', 'Bletchley', 'Park', 'where', 'team', '4', 'women', 'Jean', 'Susan', 'Millie', 'Lucy', 'work', 'together', 'code', 'breakers', 'Nazis', 'Then', 'fast', 'forward', '1952', 'London', 'unsolved', 'murders', '4', 'women', 'making', 'news', 'headlines', 'Susan', 'one', 'former', 'code', 'breakers', 'pattern', 'crimes', '3', 'old', 'friends', 'help', 'are', 'so', 'successful', 'discerning', 'patterns', 'find', 'body', '5th', 'missing', 'victim.They', 'secretly', 'continue', 'work', 'Susan', 'Lucy', 'especially', 'incur', 'great', 'personal', 'danger', 'as', 'well', 'friction', 'husbands', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'former', 'work', 'was', 'classified', 'Top', 'Secret', 'Eventually', 'realize', 'murderer', 'had', 'actually', 'killed', '12', 'women', 'years', 'was', 'clever', 'enough', 'frame', 'innocent', 'men', 'many', 'crimes', 'Suspense', 'murderer', 'are', 'closing', 'him.The', 'performers', 'were', 'excellent', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'great', 'mystery', 'puzzle', 'also', 'story', 'friendship', 'self-sacrifice', 'face', 'danger', 'help', 'others', 'also', 'quite', 'apparent', '4', 'former', 'code', 'breakers', 'loved', 'work', 'suffered', 'could', 'never', 'reveal', 'anyone', 'due', 'national', 'security', 'constraints.The', 'Blu-ray', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'offered', 'are', 'Scene', 'Selections', 'Interviews', 'cast', 'crew']","The Bletchley Circle NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

1585344,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B0094GWPOU,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[60, 63]","This is another case where it is sometimes better to watch a DVD release of a series airing on PBS than watching it on TV. The Bletchley Circle will begin airing on PBS this week as a three-part mystery. And even though you'll need to set aside an hour to watch it each week, the film (broken up into three episodes) is actually only 135 minutes (just over two hours). The episodes flow into one another with no real backtracking and I found that by watching three episodes back to back made for a richer viewing experience. The series was produced for commercial television in the UK, hence the short episodes.I'm sure a lot of the reviews posted here will be based on those who watched the series on TV and, while I haven't seen the PBS version, my guess is there will be some small edits because of a few graphic images (both violence and sexual. The Blu-ray (and the DVD, I assume) are unedited and each episode runs about 45 minutes).This film (series?) uses the standard ""looking for the serial killer"" baseline but is different because the crime (well multiple murders) are solved by four women who worked at Bletchley Park - an estate in Buckingham, England where smart women were recruited from Oxford and Cambridge in 1943 to break the ""enemy""'s code. After a brief intro, we are placed in early 1950s post-war London where four of the women - each with their own personality and home life - reunite to find a killer. There are men in the cast but every male character they interact with is either abusive or ignorant of their inner feelings. (Though women viewers will be attracted by the strong female characters, men will like the series too.) Both the script and the film's direction are by men.Most of the interesting events take part in the third ""episode"", though you need to see the previous two to understand it. Honestly, the only weak parts are when the ""killer"" is on screen. Then it's just like all the ""serial killer"" movies.The Bluray (and I'm pretty sure the DVD) does have a ""Special Feature"". It's a nicely done 28-minute featurette titled ""Electronic Press Kit"" featuring interviews with the four lead actresses (none of the male actors are included) as well as the production crew.

At the end there is mention that this just MIGHT be the beginning of an ongoing series (another serial rapist perhaps).None of the cast were familiar to me and that made it even more interesting.

1585351,A2VGV2WOEPDPRW,B0094GWPOU,The Curmudgeon,"[0, 9]","This series is based on a great idea but is marred by contemporary political correctness.  Nevertheless it combines two features which make it especially attractive.First, it is a period piece which takes place in England in 1952 just after World War II.  This is pleasing for those of us who remember the 1950s before places like England became multicultural paradises.Second, it employs a very interesting plot where four women who were codebreakers during the war try to identify a serial killer who is leaving a pattern as he commits murders around London.  This would be an excellent series if it concentrated on the intellectual task of finding the killer instead of political propaganda.The first episode emphasizes the humdrum peacetime lives of the women as if the men weren't in the same situation.  The main character is Susan and her husband  has a bureaucratic government job which is worse than anything the women face.  In fact the women have it better since they have time to pursue the killer instead of the daily grind of a regular job.  Moreover, the husband is the real victim as he has a war injury severe enough to require him to limp with a cane.In the second episode the women begin suspecting that the killer must also be an ex-espionage agent because he is so good at hiding his tracts. This episode is marred by a completely gratuitous scene where one of the women (who are sworn to secrecy) is beaten by her husband who doesn't understand what she is up to.  This story was undoubtedly made by writers who were not alive in 1952 trying to foist today's political propaganda on that era.  Anyone who remembers the 1950s knows this scene is rubbish.  It is more appropriate in today's culture, especially with its African, Muslim, and Hispanic immigrants on both sides of the Atlantic.The third episode descends into excessive melodrama as the women believe they have identified the killer who is a former agent.  He had received treatment at a mental facility after the war and Susan arranges to go to its office at night to talk to an administrator.  While talking to him she realizes that he is the killer but unlike a real serial killer he lets her go to keep the game going.  It turns out that he has been leaving clues directing her to him because he is intrigued by her abilities.When Susan tries to contact the home of his former girlfriend he answers the phone and tells her where to meet him.  She goes alone with a revolver but doesn't tell the others.  He has already set up a scheme to foil any attempt to kill or capture him.  Susan finds him and the denouement follows.",3,GREAT IDEA SPOILED,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,2610,"['series', 'based', 'great', 'idea', 'marred', 'contemporary', 'political', 'correctness', 'two', 'features', 'make', 'especially', 'attractive.First', 'period', 'piece', 'place', 'England', '1952', 'just', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'pleasing', 'who', 'remember', '1950s', 'places', 'England', 'became', 'multicultural', 'paradises.Second', 'very', 'interesting', 'plot', 'where', 'four', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'codebreakers', 'war', 'try', 'identify', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'leaving', 'pattern', 'murders', 'London', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'series', 'concentrated', 'intellectual', 'task', 'finding', 'killer', 'instead', 'political', 'propaganda.The', 'first', 'humdrum', 'peacetime', 'lives', 'women', 'men', 'were', ""n't"", 'same', 'situation', 'main', 'character', 'Susan', 'husband', 'bureaucratic', 'government', 'job', 'worse', 'anything', 'women', 'face', 'fact', 'women', 'have', 'better', 'have', 'time', 'pursue', 'killer', 'instead', 'daily', 'grind', 'regular', 'job', 'Moreover', 'husband', 'real', 'victim', 'war', 'injury', 'severe', 'enough', 'require', 'limp', 'cane.In', 'second', 'episode', 'women', 'begin', 'suspecting', 'killer', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'ex-espionage', 'agent', 'so', 'good', 'hiding', 'tracts', 'episode', 'marred', 'completely', 'gratuitous', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'sworn', 'secrecy', 'beaten', 'husband', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'up', 'story', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'made', 'writers', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'alive', '1952', 'trying', 'foist', 'today', 'political', 'propaganda', 'era', 'Anyone', 'who', '1950s', 'knows', 'scene', 'rubbish', 'more', 'appropriate', 'today', 'culture', 'especially', 'African', 'Muslim', 'Hispanic', 'immigrants', 'sides', 'Atlantic.The', 'third', 'episode', 'excessive', 'melodrama', 'women', 'believe', 'have', 'identified', 'killer', 'who', 'former', 'agent', 'had', 'received', 'treatment', 'mental', 'facility', 'war', 'Susan', 'go', 'office', 'night', 'talk', 'administrator', 'talking', 'killer', 'real', 'serial', 'killer', 'go', 'keep', 'game', 'going', 'out', 'been', 'leaving', 'clues', 'directing', 'intrigued', 'abilities.When', 'Susan', 'contact', 'home', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'phone', 'where', 'meet', 'alone', 'revolver', ""n't"", 'tell', 'others', 'already', 'set', 'up', 'scheme', 'foil', 'attempt', 'kill', 'capture', 'Susan', 'denouement']","The Bletchley Circle NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

After uncovering a hidden pattern in a stream of murders, Susan, played by Anna Maxwell Martin, initially attempts to crack the case by herself. She soon realizes her own limitations upon discovering the murder pattern to be far more complex and extensive than she had imagined and subsequently calls in her friends. Upon combining forces, they confirm the killer to be both extremly confident and an astute individual while at the same time armed with highly uncommon skills. What follows is a series of cascading events which all the time lead them closer to the mastermind while increasing their own exposure and mortal danger with each step they take.One might compare this series to the fabulous Bletchley Park thriller of 2002, Enigma, staring Dougray Scott and Kate Winslet. However, Bletchley Circle is somewhat unique in its employment of WWII code breaking techniques to solve conventional crime, a detection technique that remained pretty much unused until modern re-deployment by today's military to locate terrorists. Consequently, the circa 1950s London Police involved in apprehending the murderer graduate from initial willing partners to bungling obstacles, because the National Secrecy Act prohibits the former Bletchley sleuths from divulging their advanced skill-sets.Personally, I cannot recommend Season 1 of The Bletchley Circle too highly. With recent spikes in armed responses by today's police, the series' message of advancing intelligent detection techniques has never been more relevant. However, putting even that aside, The Bletchley Circle has jumped to the top of my television viewing list on just pure entertainment value. The writing, directing and editing is only topped by the amazing chemistry of its lead cast, which includes Anna Maxwell Martin, Rachael Stirling, Julie Graham and Sophie Rundle.

The series was shown on PBS and is also available for download here.The premise of the story is intriguing. Four women used to work as codebreakers back during WW II in Bletchley Park. Fast forward to the year 1952 - it has been several years since the war ended, and the four women have lost contact with each other. One in particular, Susan Gray (Anna Maxwell Martin who played the role of Bessie Higgins inNorth & South, Esther Summerson inEpisode 1, and Sarah Burton inSouth Riding) is leading a rather quiet life with her husband (who has no inkling of her real job during the war) and her two young children. Susan is a highly intelligent woman and is obviously looking for something to do other than childminding and housekeeping. When a series of murders take place, all involving young women, Susan thinks she may be able to help the police in their investigations. Unfortunately, her attempt to help does not yield anything, and her husband, upset at his wife's apparent interest in the case, forbids her to pursue it. Susan then decides that she might stand a better chance at solving the murders if she could get her code-breaking colleagues back together again, and so the Bletchley Circle is born.The other women in the circle are Millie (Rachael Stirling), Lucy (Sophie Rundle), and Jean (Julie Graham) and though initially skeptical and reluctant to get involved, another murder acts as the catalyst that brings the women back together. The show is engaging on many levels. The period details are credibly done and brings post-war England to life. Little things like the rationing of food in 1952 (food rationing continued till 1954) is well-depicted in the show and many more (such as fashion) that transport the viewer into the past. The four women make an interesting group of crime solvers. Each individual has a strength that lends itself to puzzling out the case. The dialogue and manner of interaction is also well depicted and I enjoyed the attention to details in each scene.The women's journey towards solving the case takes them into dark and menacing places and the show perfectly captures all the finer nuances of a good procedural. I would advise viewers who can be a little patient to wait till all three episodes are screened and then watch them back to back since I thought the story flowed better that way, instead of being chopped up, but certainly it can be enjoyed either way. The total running time on the DVD is 150 minutes.There are only three episodes in this series, but I hope to see more of Susan and company, perhaps solving another crime in the near future? This is a well made period crime drama that should appeal to fans of crime dramas and period productions.",5,Intriguing drama of WW II female codebreakers turned crime solvers,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,2830,"['was', 'able', 'watch', 'episodes', 'series', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'site', 'series', 'was', 'shown', 'PBS', 'also', 'available', 'download', 'here.The', 'premise', 'story', 'intriguing', 'Four', 'women', 'used', 'work', 'codebreakers', 'back', 'WW', 'II', 'Bletchley', 'Park', 'Fast', 'forward', 'year', '1952', 'been', 'several', 'years', 'war', 'ended', 'four', 'women', 'have', 'lost', 'contact', 'other', 'One', 'particular', 'Susan', 'Gray', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'Bessie', 'Higgins', 'inNorth', 'South', 'Esther', 'Summerson', 'inEpisode', '1', 'Sarah', 'Burton', 'Riding', 'leading', 'rather', 'quiet', 'life', 'husband', 'who', 'inkling', 'real', 'job', 'war', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'Susan', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'obviously', 'looking', 'something', 'do', 'other', 'childminding', 'housekeeping', 'When', 'series', 'murders', 'take', 'place', 'involving', 'young', 'women', 'Susan', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'police', 'investigations', 'Unfortunately', 'attempt', 'help', 'not', 'yield', 'anything', 'husband', 'upset', 'wife', 'apparent', 'interest', 'case', 'pursue', 'Susan', 'then', 'might', 'stand', 'better', 'chance', 'solving', 'murders', 'could', 'get', 'code-breaking', 'colleagues', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'so', 'Bletchley', 'Circle', 'born.The', 'other', 'women', 'circle', 'are', 'Millie', 'Rachael', 'Stirling', 'Lucy', 'Sophie', 'Rundle', 'Jean', 'Julie', 'Graham', 'initially', 'skeptical', 'reluctant', 'get', 'involved', 'murder', 'catalyst', 'women', 'back', 'together', 'show', 'engaging', 'many', 'levels', 'period', 'details', 'are', 'credibly', 'done', 'post-war', 'England', 'life', 'Little', 'things', 'rationing', 'food', '1952', 'food', 'rationing', 'continued', 'till', '1954', 'well-depicted', 'show', 'many', 'more', 'such', 'fashion', 'transport', 'viewer', 'past', 'four', 'women', 'make', 'interesting', 'group', 'crime', 'solvers', 'individual', 'strength', 'puzzling', 'out', 'case', 'dialogue', 'manner', 'interaction', 'also', 'well', 'depicted', 'enjoyed', 'attention', 'details', 'scene.The', 'women', 'journey', 'towards', 'solving', 'case', 'dark', 'menacing', 'places', 'show', 'perfectly', 'finer', 'nuances', 'good', 'procedural', 'would', 'advise', 'viewers', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'patient', 'wait', 'till', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'screened', 'then', 'watch', 'back', 'back', 'thought', 'story', 'flowed', 'better', 'way', 'instead', 'being', 'chopped', 'up', 'certainly', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'DVD', '150', 'minutes.There', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'series', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'Susan', 'company', 'perhaps', 'solving', 'crime', 'near', 'future', 'well', 'made', 'period', 'crime', 'drama', 'should', 'appeal', 'fans', 'crime', 'dramas', 'period', 'productions']","The Bletchley Circle NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"
