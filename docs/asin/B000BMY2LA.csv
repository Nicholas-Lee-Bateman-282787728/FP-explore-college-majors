If you are easily offended, this film is certainly NOT for you as it seems determined to offend just about everyone along the way.Evan Rachel Wood portrays a character who is at once annoying, sadistic and mesmerizing.  In short, Wood is magnificent.  She plays a young girl named Kimberly who is used to getting her way - no matter what it takes.  She manipulates people of both genders with ease, and is the ultimate hypocrite in being so conniving while at the same time attempting to convince people that she stands for intra-cultural relations.While this movie has some fairly funny scenes, it is not a movie that will leave a good taste in your mouth - at all.

Politics is surely apart of its sense of humor from middle-eastern exchange students to Jewish jokes. This is surely a movie that you'll find hilarious or just plain demeaning.Personally, I found it almost too witty to keep up with at times. Every action seemed ironic which got annoying to comprehend & enjoy the ride because I was too busy trying to read between the lines / actions. A lot of the acting uses manipulation which I found very impressive from the people behind scenes creating the illusion that ironically takes place in Beverly Hills at a private school. All the subjects & factors of it will leave viewers stunned has they watch the unbelievable / incomprehensible of controversies right before their very eyes. I'm not at all surprised that the quick spoken, Evan Rachel Wood plays the lead. It does a great job of making fun of stereotypes & pushes the envelope leaving the viewer speechless, you gotta hand it to the writers, the cleverness implied is impeccable.The movie itself is amazing. The underlining message is meaningless with no substance or trace of moral conscienceness. It, itself says something about the harshness of life & who, in reality, ends up winning most of the time. This movie there isn't a question of bad or good because not all the ones that did wrong were bad, just manipulated into doing bad things as in like Othello. Overall the actions of the characters are tragic to themselves since they paint a distorted image of who they really are. There is only an antagnoist in this movie & one plan of revenge to distribute pain to the whole cast simply for not catering to a petty little bitch's needs. & Why would she cause so much havoc among everybody she knows? She's bad but that's not important, simply because she can.

945124,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000BMY2LA,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 5]","""Pretty Persuasion"" is a demented dark comedy that deals with quite a few social issues in a pretty humorous way. I guess you could call this movie an emotionless hunk of s**t, but it's actually well done and the end message is pretty good. Personally I think of this as a teenage version of ""Wild Things"" because it has a very simalar plot and a very simalar end. And, like Wild Things even when you know what's going on you find out you're wrong. The movie stars Evan Rachel Wood (the wonderful actress from ""Thirteen"") ditching her blond hair for a brunette 'do. Wood is Kimberly Joyce, a manipulative 15 year old aspiring actress. Kimberly, along with her friends Brittany and Randa accuse their teacher Mr. Anderson (Ron Livingston from ""Office Space"") of sexual assault and harrasment. The ensuing trial then brings out some interesting details about what's really happening and then there's also the lesbian reporter. And well, I guess there's really no point in my explaining it even further...Hopefully, you're intrigued enough. Selma Blair also appears in the film as Mr. Anderson's sexy wife. Anyway, the only reason I rented this movie was because I like Wood, she's a phenomenal actress which she proves yet again in this film. But, I found that this movie is actually pretty damn good. The acting is good, the script is good, the dialouge is very well written and pretty smart & witty, the movie is very funny and the entire cast work well together. This movie is pretty perfect.

945125,A3G98NEA8A9K8H,B000BMY2LA,J. Stoneking,"[4, 14]","My attention towards this movie was first caught in a review written in ""Video Business Magazine"" that said that Pretty Pesuasion was a movie that we would get if John Waters had directed Heathers.  They also compared it to another one of my all time favorite comedies, Election.  So when I saw this available on DVD for rental, I picked it up (and it was a free rental, thankfully.)What would I compare this movie to?  Perhaps a little of Wild Things meets Mean Girls meets a train wreck.  It's hardly a break through role for Evan Rachel Wood (Thirteen did that for her nicely, thanks) and the rest of the cast just meanders about on screen aimlessly, as if waiting for some competent direction Marcos Siega, but Marcos doesn't succeed in the transition from music video/tv episode director to movie director very well.  If this movie had been shortened to an hour long pilot for a TV show, it would have worked so much better.  However, as a feature length movie, it's too long.James Woods is quite interesting in his role as Hank Joyce, but his character, like so many others in the movie, are not fleshed out enough for me to care about them.  I hardly even care for Evan Rachel Wood's character, but am  I supposed to?  She is a horror of a human in this movie, and the most sympathy I feel is for the characters around her, particularly in the characters of Britney and especially Randa.It's listed as a comedy, but there are too many depressing things in this movie to make it even a good black comedy.  I won't go into too much in my review, as I don't want to write any spoilers, but one scene in particular towards the end (and if you have seen it, you should know what I am talking about) is devastating, and for what little laughs were in the film, it makes you forget any ""comedy"" you saw before then.",1,"Nothing special to see here, folks",1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,1815,"['attention', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'caught', 'review', 'written', 'Video', 'Business', 'Magazine', 'said', 'Pretty', 'Pesuasion', 'was', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'John', 'Waters', 'had', 'directed', 'Heathers', 'also', 'compared', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'Election', 'when', 'saw', 'available', 'DVD', 'rental', 'picked', 'up', 'was', 'free', 'rental', 'thankfully', 'What', 'would', 'compare', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'little', 'Wild', 'Things', 'meets', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'train', 'wreck', 'hardly', 'break', 'role', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Thirteen', 'did', 'nicely', 'thanks', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'meanders', 'screen', 'aimlessly', 'waiting', 'competent', 'direction', 'Marcos', 'Siega', 'Marcos', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'transition', 'music', 'video/tv', 'episode', 'director', 'movie', 'director', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'shortened', 'hour', 'long', 'pilot', 'TV', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'However', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'too', 'long.James', 'Woods', 'quite', 'interesting', 'role', 'Hank', 'Joyce', 'character', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'care', 'hardly', 'even', 'care', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'character', 'am', 'supposed', 'horror', 'human', 'movie', 'most', 'sympathy', 'feel', 'characters', 'particularly', 'characters', 'Britney', 'especially', 'Randa.It', 'listed', 'comedy', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'depressing', 'things', 'movie', 'make', 'even', 'good', 'black', 'comedy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'write', 'spoilers', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'towards', 'end', 'have', 'seen', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'devastating', 'what', 'little', 'laughs', 'were', 'film', 'forget', 'comedy', 'saw', 'then']",Pretty Persuasion
945126,AA68BSG4MNKA6,B000BMY2LA,Kevin C. Li,"[1, 6]","In this movie, it is okay.  Not too good, but not too bad.  Although it is a teen, high school movie, it is not as good as other same type of movies that I saw before.  For the story, it talks about Manipulative high school sophomore Kimberly Joyce (Evan Rachel Wood) leads her friends Brittany Wells (Elisabeth Harnois) and Randa Azzouni (Adi Schnall) in bringing charges of sexual assault against Percy Anderson (Ron Livingston), their English and drama teacher at an exclusive private school in Beverly Hills. Meanwhile, local reporter Emily Klein (Jane Krakowski), originally assigned to do an insignificant piece on the school, hopes that the scandal will launch her into celebrity in the television news business, while Kimberly's bigoted father, Hank (James Woods), is concerned primarily with the effect that his daughter's accusations may have on his business.  As a result, the attack on Percy Anderson failed and the three girls are suspended from that high school.  For this story, it is just like a general story with not much surprise.  For the acting, they are all okay.  However, I like Evan Rachel Wood acts as Kimberly Joyce, she suits to act and she acts well as one of the ""bad girl"" role as Kimberly Joyce.  For the direction, it is good because the whole structure looks logical.  For the visuals, it is not much of a surprise.  However, I like the DVD make in 2:35.1 widescreen version.  Although this movie is not very well known, it is essential to make it to this extreme widescreen version because in my opinion, 2:35.1 widescreen DVD is more like a ""movie"".

945127,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000BMY2LA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I absolutely love a black comedy that can effectively push buttons, stand as intelligent social commentary, and be hilarious at the same time. ""Heathers"" as an exploration of teen suicide is just about perfection to me. Nasty and spot on, it poked fun of, and revealed many truths behind, a topic that was considered a ""sacred cow."" I also admired ""Citizen Ruth,"" the underappreciated and wacky abortion comedy. Those movies were challenging and unexpected. So it was with great anticipation that I checked out ""Pretty Persuasion."" I was one of the few that caught this film in a theater, but I recently rewatched it to see if my opinion had changed.As much as I admired the thought behind the movie, the idea is actually better than the execution. Evan Rachel Wood is a serious actress not afraid to take risks and I can see what compelled her to sign on to this film. As a morally questionable high school girl, she will break any taboo and tell any lie to achieve power and status. This includes initiating a sex scandal in school involving one of her teachers. Molestation, statutory assault and/or any type of sexual context between adults and minors is not usually the fodder for a comedy--and this is where the film hopes to shock you.It does seem apparent, however, that ""Heathers"" was a role model for this film. But what seemed more organic in that movie illuminates the weakness of ""Pretty Persuasion."" It simply tries too hard! Every setup is too calculated for maximum shock value. Everything is a little too convenient. Toward the end, we're asked to take things a little more seriously--but in truth, the film hasn't earned this change of tone and so it falls flat.I would recommend this film provisionally to the right crowd. Wood is a terrific actress. James Woods, in a way over-the-top performance as her despicable father, is amusing if not completely convincing. But if you're a fan of his, you won't want to miss this. There are some good lines, good satire and an interesting setup. It's not a wholly successful film, but at least when it fails, it's an interesting failure and it tries to take some risks and be different and thoughtful.

945128,ATNQJL1SF21TS,B000BMY2LA,"lb136 ""lb136""","[5, 8]","In one scene in this amazing acid-drenched satire of the familiar ""teenage"" movie, Evan Rachel Wood's teen-aged Iaga, Kimberly Joyce, is seen standing on the courthouse steps in a long shot, apart from the chaos she's created, looking like a human gargoyle. That's pretty much what she is.Kimberly, a whip-smart super-cynical sociopath in a private school in Beverly Hills (where else?) is out for revenge, and she takes no prisoners. Always perfect in appearance, always arrogant in manner, she cajoles and persuades in every way she can, and she has no qualms about trading sexual favors, either. Why should she? She hates everyone and everything. She lives with her father, a raving bigot in a great turn by the barely recognizable James Woods, and bimbotic stepmother (in one hysterical dinnertable scene she hopes Wood will call her ""Mother""; Wood replies with an obscenity, which seems to be about all she ever says to her), and--as we see in the first scene--she's an aspiring actress. When she's removed from the school play (they're doing ""Anne Frank"" and she's to have been the lead) for making anti-Semitic remarks, she decides to get revenge upon the English teacher who's in charge of putting the play on, and does so with the aid of her best friend Brittany and a middle eastern girl, Randa, who she uses pretty much as a sounding board while she spews out her own ideas of society. (Both have certain issues with the teacher.) They cook up a sexual harassment scenario with the aid of a lesbian TV reporter (Jane Krakowski, from ""Ally McBeel""), which--the girls hope--will end in the teacher's dismissal. Kimberly is certain the case won't come to trial, but . . . well, see for yourself.Director Marcos Siega gets great performances out of the entire cast, and he gives the film a pastelly look--the school unis, in which we see Kimberly much of the time, are in comforting pink and grey--a jarring contrast with the girl's soullessness.",5,Soulless in Pink,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,1953,"['one', 'scene', 'amazing', 'acid-drenched', 'satire', 'familiar', 'teenage', 'movie', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'teen-aged', 'Iaga', 'Kimberly', 'Joyce', 'seen', 'standing', 'courthouse', 'steps', 'long', 'shot', 'apart', 'chaos', 'created', 'looking', 'human', 'gargoyle', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'is.Kimberly', 'whip-smart', 'super-cynical', 'sociopath', 'private', 'school', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'where', 'else', 'out', 'revenge', 'prisoners', 'Always', 'perfect', 'appearance', 'always', 'arrogant', 'manner', 'persuades', 'way', 'can', 'qualms', 'trading', 'sexual', 'favors', 'either', 'Why', 'should', 'everyone', 'everything', 'father', 'raving', 'bigot', 'great', 'turn', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'James', 'Woods', 'bimbotic', 'stepmother', 'one', 'hysterical', 'dinnertable', 'scene', 'Wood', 'will', 'call', 'Mother', 'Wood', 'replies', 'obscenity', 'be', 'ever', 'see', 'first', 'scene', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'When', 'removed', 'school', 'play', ""'re"", 'doing', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'have', 'been', 'lead', 'making', 'anti-Semitic', 'remarks', 'get', 'revenge', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'charge', 'putting', 'play', 'so', 'aid', 'best', 'friend', 'Brittany', 'middle', 'eastern', 'girl', 'Randa', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'sounding', 'board', 'out', 'own', 'ideas', 'society', 'have', 'certain', 'issues', 'teacher', 'cook', 'up', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'scenario', 'aid', 'lesbian', 'TV', 'reporter', 'Jane', 'Krakowski', 'Ally', 'McBeel', 'girls', 'hope', 'will', 'end', 'teacher', 'dismissal', 'Kimberly', 'certain', 'case', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'trial', 'well', 'see', 'yourself.Director', 'Marcos', 'Siega', 'great', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'film', 'pastelly', 'look', 'school', 'unis', 'see', 'Kimberly', 'much', 'time', 'are', 'comforting', 'pink', 'grey', 'jarring', 'contrast', 'girl', 'soullessness']",Pretty Persuasion

There is so much exploitive language and perversions (mostly discussed rather than demonstrated) that I was regretting my purchase 20-25 minutes into the story, even though I was laughing fairly often-especially at Kimberly's (Evan Rachel Wood) comments about the relationship between her stepmother and her dog. I was amazed that Wood had agreed to do this thing and felt that in a few years she would regret having it on her resume.But after about 30 minutes I was either hardened to the dialogue or had begun to understand that most of it was there for a legitimate purpose. And to enjoy ""Pretty Persuasion"" you have to be willing to accept a fair amount of what first seems needless exploitation. It used to be that teenagers went to the movies to see adults making love, now adults go to the movies to see teenagers making love, or at least speaking and behaving suggestively.This black comedy and parental neglect social statement comes 50 years after Ed Wood featured it in ""The Violent Years"". Instead of a gang of privileged girls robbing gas stations, 15 year old Kimberly and her two classmates, best friend Brittany (Elisabeth Harnois) and shy Muslim girl Randa (Adi Schnall), bring sexual harassment charges against one of their teachers. And ""Pretty Persuasion"" introduces a lot more dark wit into the equation, a function of Skander Halim's screenplay and Marcos Siega's direction.The most intriguing thing about ""Pretty Persuasion"" is the way it embeds a complementary theme about Hollywood hypocrisy in the very structure of the film. Promiscuous teenage girls and lesbians are established titillation elements in exploitation films. And during viewing you are subtly persuaded that you are watching a fairly graphic exploitation film.  It is only upon later reflection that you realize that you have actually seen nothing, everything was implied by the dialogue or staged partially off-camera. A prudish viewer is not offended so much by the images as by the implications that they have supplied themselves.As a response to the growing sexual exploitation element in films, beginning in the 1930's Hollywood self-regulated itself through the Hays Code. Its provisions stated that: ""pictures shall not infer that low forms of sex relationships are the accepted and common thing"", ""scenes of passion should not be introduced when not essential to the plot"", and ""seduction or rape should never be more than suggested"". The tone of ""Pretty Persuasion"" is disapproving of the sexual relationships that are taking place, its scenes of passion are essential to the plot, and the seduction takes place off camera; making it at least technically in compliance with the old code.The story is told from Kimberly's point of view and ""Pretty Persuasion is a good example of the power of POV in fostering identification and sympathy for the character through whom we are witnessing the main events. By the end most viewers are perversely hoping that Kimberly will be successful. Few actors could elicit sympathy for this character but Wood manages to do so, you work to resist her but ultimately you lose.You are further won over at the end when you realize that Kimberly's cynicism is largely justified, even if her actions are not. Were she able to choose, Kimberly would not elect to so cynical,  it is simply a reflection of a world that is a major disappointment to her. So the character Wood brings to the screen is one that you go  from hating, to sympathizing with, to admiring.The theme of cynicism, as well as its cause and effect, has never been better dealt with than in this film. Using sex as her commodity and insightful analysis of other's weaknesses as her weapon, the disillusioned Kimberly is pretty much able to manipulate the world to suit her designs.Wood is becoming the Tuesday Weld of her generation but is treating us to stuff in her mid- teens that Weld did not do until her mid-20's. Think of ""Pretty Poison"" and ""I Walk the Line"". Or even more appropriately Weld''s portrayal of Abigail in ""The Crucible"", because at its core ""Pretty Persuasion"" is a modern version of Arthur Miller's classic;  an intriguing blend of ""The Crucible"", ""To Die For"" and ""Heathers"".After watching Wood in ""Pretty Persuasion"", you realize that it is not something to be purged from her resume but something she should highlight.Then again, what do I know?

She befriends a rich Muslim girl (who knows nothing about anything) and the jokes start immediately as the contrast between them is obvious. The comedy tone is further enhanced by the fact that most other characters are caricatures and stereotypes (like her father who is a racist/tough businessman, her mother who only calls her for a few minutes and boys who only want sex).The comedy tone goes on for some 25 minutes and all we see is the funny interactions between the girls. Until they decide to accuse their English teacher of sexual harassment.Then, the film starts to switch its mood entirely and goes into the thriller territory as it goes darker and darker through the manipulating schemes devised by the protagonist - with tragic consequences and an ending likeDangerous Liaisons.This is not necessarily a bad film... the story is well told... but it is obvious that the film does not know exactly what it is (and who its audience is). It is strange because from a certain point on, the comedy loses its laughs and the audience is lost for 20 minutes until the new tone firmly sets in (around 50-60 minutes into the film). Then, even after it's gone darker and darker... some characters obviously still act like a comedy - while the story has already gone for thriller.I'm sure the distributor felt the difficulty of marketing a film that actually is like two films mixed together. It is obvious to me that they thought it was a safer bet to try to pass it for a plain comedy.

945136,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000BMY2LA,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[5, 9]","Kimberly Joyce, a teen raised in a privileged California community - is a one-woman weapon of mass destruction.  Insatiable and manipulative, she conspires with two of her friends to destroy one of her high-school teachers - a likely pederast played by Ron Livingston.  While the plot plays out in a virtually futile court battle charging Livingston's character with sexual molestation, much of the story display's Kimberly's unsavory attitudes and her talent for maneuvering her friends like chess pieces.  Aspiring to become an actress, Kimberly has no inner self - she lies, maneuvers and curses.  Her father (James Woods) is an out-and-out racist whose angry platitudes are softened and yet made more lethal in Kimberly.  Yet Kimberly is not primarily racist as simply misanthropic; celebrity isn't her top ambition either.  You'll have to wait the entire film to realize what her deepest desire is and how many must suffer before she achieves it.This was a horrible movie - not even a close call.  Remember ""Wild Things""?  That movie centered on sexual exploitation as well - with the plot driven by conflicting agendas of the conspirators (we were always supposed to wonder about who was really fooling who).  In ""Persuasion"", we know who the puppet master is - all the characters are transparent, even when they're lying.  Played by Evan Rachel Wood, Kimberly looks like a brunette version of one of those kids from ""Village of the Damned"".  Instead of noir mystery, ""Persuasion"" offers up a pre-packaged indictment of America - it's a sort of hall-of-mirrors version of everything wrong with our country, with each of the characters reflecting a given flaw of our national conscious.  There are no sympathetic characters - Livingston's character may be a pederast after all; Kimberly exploits a narcissistic television reporter who seems to have it coming; all of Kimberly's friends are low-wattage versions of her - which is to say that they're amateur manipulators.While the population of unsavory types wouldn't doom the movie, the problem is that none of these characters is remotely believable.  All of the teens spout the sort of lines that teens only say in rip-offs of ""Dawson's Creek"" (""My God, Brittany, it's like the world is this orchestra and I'm the conductor"") or anything else directed by Kevin Williamson, and exist only to confirm our cynical Hollywood-driven prejudices of American culture - which is that we're ever so much more selfish and boorish than the people who write these movies.  The flick proceeds on a set of incomprehensible and forced plot-twists which pose no surprise other than shocking you with the ends the script will go to suspend your sense of disbelief and then slap you upside the face for buying its characters' dim homilies.  Towards the end, the immigrant father of a schoolmate tragically swept by Kimberly's plot is heard to sob ""We came for the American Dream, and found only a nightmare!""  I came looking for a sharp movie, and found only a dull mess.",2,arch and inept  Hollywood message movie,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,3010,"['Kimberly', 'Joyce', 'teen', 'raised', 'privileged', 'California', 'community', 'one-woman', 'weapon', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Insatiable', 'manipulative', 'two', 'friends', 'destroy', 'one', 'high-school', 'teachers', 'likely', 'pederast', 'played', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'plot', 'out', 'virtually', 'futile', 'court', 'battle', 'charging', 'Livingston', 'character', 'sexual', 'molestation', 'much', 'story', 'display', 'Kimberly', 'unsavory', 'attitudes', 'talent', 'maneuvering', 'friends', 'chess', 'pieces', 'Aspiring', 'become', 'actress', 'Kimberly', 'inner', 'self', 'maneuvers', 'curses', 'father', 'James', 'Woods', 'out-and-out', 'racist', 'angry', 'platitudes', 'are', 'softened', 'yet', 'made', 'more', 'lethal', 'Kimberly', 'Kimberly', 'not', 'primarily', 'racist', 'simply', 'misanthropic', 'celebrity', ""n't"", 'top', 'ambition', 'either', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'entire', 'film', 'realize', 'what', 'deepest', 'desire', 'how', 'many', 'must', 'suffer', 'it.This', 'was', 'horrible', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'call', 'Remember', 'Wild', 'Things', 'movie', 'centered', 'sexual', 'exploitation', 'well', 'plot', 'driven', 'conflicting', 'agendas', 'conspirators', 'were', 'always', 'supposed', 'wonder', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'fooling', 'who', 'Persuasion', 'know', 'who', 'puppet', 'master', 'characters', 'are', 'transparent', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'lying', 'Played', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Kimberly', 'brunette', 'version', 'one', 'kids', 'Village', 'Damned', 'Instead', 'noir', 'mystery', 'Persuasion', 'up', 'pre-packaged', 'indictment', 'America', 'sort', 'hall-of-mirrors', 'version', 'everything', 'wrong', 'country', 'characters', 'reflecting', 'given', 'flaw', 'national', 'conscious', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'Livingston', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'pederast', 'Kimberly', 'narcissistic', 'television', 'reporter', 'who', 'have', 'coming', 'Kimberly', 'friends', 'are', 'low-wattage', 'versions', 'say', ""'re"", 'amateur', 'population', 'unsavory', 'types', 'would', ""n't"", 'doom', 'movie', 'problem', 'none', 'characters', 'remotely', 'believable', 'teens', 'spout', 'sort', 'lines', 'only', 'say', 'rip-offs', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'My', 'God', 'Brittany', 'world', 'orchestra', ""'m"", 'conductor', 'anything', 'else', 'directed', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'exist', 'only', 'confirm', 'cynical', 'Hollywood-driven', 'prejudices', 'American', 'culture', ""'re"", 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'selfish', 'boorish', 'people', 'who', 'write', 'movies', 'flick', 'proceeds', 'set', 'incomprehensible', 'forced', 'plot-twists', 'pose', 'surprise', 'other', 'shocking', 'ends', 'script', 'will', 'go', 'suspend', 'sense', 'disbelief', 'then', 'slap', 'face', 'buying', 'characters', 'dim', 'homilies', 'end', 'immigrant', 'father', 'schoolmate', 'tragically', 'swept', 'Kimberly', 'plot', 'heard', 'sob', 'came', 'American', 'Dream', 'found', 'only', 'nightmare', 'came', 'looking', 'sharp', 'movie', 'found', 'only', 'dull', 'mess']",Pretty Persuasion

The film contains comical overdone simulated sex scenes. I enjoyed the attention to detail as Kimberly packs a copy of the book, ""Diary of Anne Frank"" near the end of the story, a book everyone, including myself believed was not to exist. The frequent remarks made to her step-mother in a nonchalant manner about having sex with the dog, being ignored by her father while having his own conversation ,was extremely funny which had me laughing in the aisle. Extremely well written as the plot and characters develop, you see where Kimberly steals her ideas from as she uses lines from a porno movie to seduce a female reporter. The movie interacts brilliantly between the scenes. The ending could have been better, i.e. a little less tragic.

I thought it tried WAY to hard to be controversial with the excessive racial slurs and sexual diaologue. What was with the "" you f**k the dog"" comments to Wood's stepmother? Totally out of the blue and not funny. Anyway, the movie's about a spoiled rich girl in a Mean Girls type highschool.  Same type of issues as Wild Things, two girls trying to get their teacher falsey accused of sexual assault.  This movie was not very clever or particularly interesting.  The only thing it did to try to separate itself from Wild Things/Mean Girls was the ridiculous amount of racist and dirty talk.  I found it to be pretty boring and most of the laughing I did was uncomfortable , not-sure-how-to-take the jokes laughing.  Aside from the poor writing, Evan Rachel Wood played a great villain.
