1107606,A231K716D7POU3,B000WBZ5XO,Hank Napkin,"[8, 8]","Where have I been not to find out about this great show until now? This minimalist, keenly observed comedy is terrific precisely due to the fact that it's ""not for everyone"". And in addition to being so distinct in its production technique (we are nearly always voyeurs of a confined sitting room whose cramped quarters call to mind the claustrophobic ""visits to mum"" by the Krays), here we have something even more unique. The writing is always working on at least three levels: the humor that the characters share with each other; the humor the characters don't recognize themselves that is delivered solely to the viewer; and the often subtle and wry interplay between the character dialogue and whatever happens to be playing on the ever present television, the television that implicitly controls the sitting room and by extension, large chunks of the characters' lives.Not to mention the now nagging certainty that we are often watching ourselves watching television.As casual as the enterprise may seem, the acting is immaculately detailed, especially given the intimate scale of the program. The writers, cast and directors must be given credit for invoking such a genuine sense of place and character. Like the excellent character work in ""Saxondale"" and the even more cramped quarters of the monologue-driven, short-form  ""Marion & Geoff"" (thanks in all cases, including TRF, to the talent of Henry Normal), ""The Royle Family"" is more innovative than it first appears, letting you laugh in unexpected ways.

1107607,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B000WBZ5XO,Kathy-W,"[0, 0]","Since I'm the first 3-star review, I'm sure someone will vote this review as unhelpful, and I don't much care. Here's my rating reasoning.Remember Monty Python's sketch ""The Most Awful Family in Britain""? This is a sitcom version of that same idea (and I use the term ""sitcom"" very loosely...there usually isn't enough plot to truly move things along). The family is often awkward and always slobbish. Most characters are lazy, obnoxious, or rude. Talk about TV junk food.Jim is without shame or modesty (although he has a triple helping of pride), holding back neither his opinions nor his bodily functions. Half his actions will make you cringe and half of them will make you want to reach through the screen and smack him. Denise tries to be pleasant, but is very possibly the laziest character on the show, constantly whining about food or a ""honey-do"" item her husband or family has failed to complete yet. Dave is a decent fellow, but almost as lazy as Denise (and appears to only put up with Denise because his temper is feebler than hers). Poor Anthony is put upon, but his sneers stop you from truly feeling sorry for him.The only one you can really sympathize with is Barbara, a woman who is so stretched between her job, her housework, and putting up with her husband that she is exhausted and hasn't quite accepted the idea that she is simply feeling her age.Liz Smith as Norma Jean is a comparatively refreshing presence (but there's not quite enough of her). Her bizarrely placid crudeness frequently competes with Jim's and it's easy to see why they argue so much. The only scenes I fully enjoyed were the ones with Liz in them.I suppose there is something fun and surreal about such an astoundingly average family in all their flawed glory, but I have trouble enjoying this show. The dialogue is often quite sparse because lengthy scenes center around the family staring blankly at the television. The family banter can have some great giggles, but I didn't see enough of it to pursue multiple viewings of episodes.I also realize that the ghastly feeling of this show was probably intentional, but comedies are supposed to be relatable and a bit escapist. This show just reminds me how depressing some of my casual acquaintances are (RE: Denise's constant master manipulation). If you're very brave, go check out some free video clips online before deciding any action on buying this one.",3,Artistically ghastly,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,2404,"[""'m"", 'first', '3-star', 'review', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'will', 'vote', 'review', 'unhelpful', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'Here', 'rating', 'reasoning.Remember', 'Monty', 'Python', 'sketch', 'Most', 'Awful', 'Family', 'Britain', 'sitcom', 'version', 'same', 'idea', 'use', 'term', 'sitcom', 'very', 'loosely', 'usually', ""n't"", 'enough', 'plot', 'truly', 'move', 'things', 'along', 'family', 'often', 'awkward', 'always', 'slobbish', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'lazy', 'obnoxious', 'rude', 'Talk', 'TV', 'junk', 'food.Jim', 'shame', 'modesty', 'triple', 'helping', 'pride', 'holding', 'back', 'opinions', 'bodily', 'functions', 'actions', 'will', 'make', 'cringe', 'half', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'reach', 'screen', 'smack', 'Denise', 'be', 'pleasant', 'very', 'possibly', 'laziest', 'character', 'show', 'constantly', 'whining', 'food', 'honey-do', 'item', 'husband', 'family', 'failed', 'complete', 'yet', 'Dave', 'decent', 'fellow', 'almost', 'as', 'lazy', 'Denise', 'only', 'put', 'up', 'Denise', 'temper', 'feebler', 'hers', 'Poor', 'Anthony', 'put', 'sneers', 'stop', 'truly', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'him.The', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'sympathize', 'Barbara', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'stretched', 'job', 'housework', 'putting', 'up', 'husband', 'exhausted', ""n't"", 'quite', 'accepted', 'idea', 'simply', 'feeling', 'age.Liz', 'Smith', 'Norma', 'Jean', 'comparatively', 'refreshing', 'presence', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'bizarrely', 'placid', 'crudeness', 'frequently', 'Jim', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'argue', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'scenes', 'fully', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'ones', 'Liz', 'them.I', 'suppose', 'something', 'fun', 'surreal', 'astoundingly', 'average', 'family', 'flawed', 'glory', 'have', 'trouble', 'enjoying', 'show', 'dialogue', 'often', 'quite', 'sparse', 'lengthy', 'scenes', 'center', 'family', 'staring', 'blankly', 'television', 'family', 'banter', 'can', 'have', 'great', 'giggles', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'pursue', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'episodes.I', 'also', 'realize', 'ghastly', 'feeling', 'show', 'was', 'probably', 'intentional', 'comedies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'relatable', 'bit', 'escapist', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'depressing', 'casual', 'acquaintances', 'are', 'RE', 'Denise', 'constant', 'master', 'manipulation', ""'re"", 'very', 'brave', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'free', 'video', 'clips', 'online', 'deciding', 'action', 'buying', 'one']",The Royle Family: Season 2
