Well deserved.Ryan Reynolds plays `Paul Conroy' a truck driver who wakes up in a wooden box. He has no idea why or how he got there...the film rolls showing this characters unbearable experience in one single location. It is obviously suffocating, terrifying and extremely intense. Ryan Reynolds does a tremendous job in this emotionally charged desperate situation. This story is of nightmares, the films simplicity is one of awe. After seeing this at the cinema I bought the Blu-ray, it's a definite for my own collection.I was a little depressed afterwards, nothing to do with the film. I was just gutted that I didn't come up with this story. It's an actor's dream role and must have been an economical project to fund. I find it astonishing that no one else has created a story like this before, some films have come close though. Not one to watch if you have a heart condition because the tension is nauseating to say the least. `Buried' has won several awards from four different film award organizations. I'm sure some people might not appreciate this film or they don't want to watch it knowing the concept. It's intelligent, well scripted and edited. Everyone involved in this production should be very proud.

1349120,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B003L20IFQ,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","SYNOPSIS--BURIED (Spain/USA/France-2010) is the sad and frightening story of Paul Conroy, a truck driver sent to Iraq by his contractor employer to help with that country's rebuilding. After a group of Iraqis kill some of his friends, Paul is captured and knocked unconscious. He awakens in a totally dark place, fumbles around and finds his lighter, an old-fashioned metal one. Paul soon realizes he's been imprisoned in a wooden box, and since its walls can't be budged, he must be buried alive! Rage and panic quickly set in.An Iraqi calls, issues a 9 PM deadline for his release and demands a $5 million ransom. Paul begs to be freed from his tomb right now but is refused. His captors have supplied him with two glow sticks, a faulty flashlight, the cellphone, and a pen kife. On him he's got a small flask of alcohol and a bottle of anti-anxiety pills. Both soon come in handy.The cellphone's battery is at half-power. Somehow in the next two hours he must negotiate with the terrorist who keeps calling and demanding money, plus reach the U.S. State Dept., his wife, his elderly mom and a local hostage negotiator. Time, air, battery and hope steadily run out.As things become desperate, the captor's demands get more bizarre. A phone call from the company he works for is the final insult. When bombs explode aboveground, Paul's coffin springs a leak. Will help arrive before he chokes to death on the sand that's filling his small space?The only hokey part is when a hissing snake finds its way into the rough-hewn packing case. Other than that, Ryan Reynolds does a magnificent job of carrying this film alone, with the help of voices on a cellphone.Very highly recommended!",4,"Paul Conroy: ""I'm buried in a box.

1349121,A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B003L20IFQ,Annihilatrix1138,"[2, 5]","Ryan Reynolds in a box for an hour and a half. That's how it was sold, that's what I was expecting, but that's not what I got. Ryan Reynolds could have been in a box anywhere else in the world, and the director still probably would have churned out an effective thriller. But I get the feeling that this was not a thriller by design. Ryan Reynolds is in a box, buried somewhere in the Iraqi desert, and help seems sooner to come from the people who put him there than the country that employed him. Why is that?As is, this is an effective thriller. Don't expect to be frightened; expect tension, a touch of claustrophobia, and those uncomfortable moments when you find yourself trying to decide what YOU would do if you ever found yourself in the same predicament. You have a phone, a Zippo lighter, and a collection of pencils. Who do you call? Just how patient could you remain in a coffin, buried somewhere, at some depth, knowing your oxygen was slowly dwindling down to nothing?Visualizing the method for filming BURIED, I can tell production probably involved  not much more than Ryan Reynolds in a cheap coffin, in a dark area, for long stretches of time in some film studio somewhere. But Ryan Reynolds made me believe that he was a truck driver for a contractor company who suddenly found himself buried alive. His acting here is amazingly involving. He asked all the questions I would have asked, with just the right amount of intensity, and lost his cool at all the right cues. Again, Ryan Reynolds in a box for an hour and a half, but I believed every second of it.But what I loved the most about this film was that it really aspired to be more than just a thriller. If help for Reynolds's character came immediately, it would be a really short movie. Most of his tribulations in that coffin stem from the inability and, in some cases, complete unwillingness of his contacts to rescue him. His capture becomes something less than a simple ""search and rescue"" in the eyes of the military and his employers, and becomes something a little more political. At some point, you have to stop and wonder if something like this would actually happen. Maybe, maybe not, but what's the life of one truck driver worth to a company that could stand to lose millions? Or to a branch of the military that might be publicly embarrassed by the incident?Good question! That's all I can say. This was a great movie that, to me, worked on several different levels, played at various moral dilemmas, and showed that Ryan Reynolds definitely has the talent worthy of something more than the odd comedy. If he doesn't get a nomination, I'd be surprised.",5,What's the life of one man worth?,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,2642,"['Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'box', 'hour', 'half', 'how', 'was', 'sold', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'not', 'what', 'got', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'box', 'anywhere', 'else', 'world', 'director', 'still', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'churned', 'out', 'effective', 'thriller', 'get', 'feeling', 'was', 'not', 'thriller', 'design', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'box', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'Iraqi', 'desert', 'help', 'sooner', 'come', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'there', 'country', 'employed', 'Why', 'As', 'effective', 'thriller', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'frightened', 'expect', 'tension', 'touch', 'claustrophobia', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'when', 'find', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'YOU', 'would', 'do', 'ever', 'found', 'same', 'predicament', 'have', 'phone', 'Zippo', 'lighter', 'collection', 'pencils', 'Who', 'do', 'call', 'Just', 'how', 'patient', 'could', 'remain', 'coffin', 'buried', 'somewhere', 'depth', 'knowing', 'oxygen', 'was', 'slowly', 'dwindling', 'down', 'nothing', 'Visualizing', 'method', 'filming', 'BURIED', 'can', 'tell', 'production', 'probably', 'involved', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'cheap', 'coffin', 'dark', 'area', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'film', 'studio', 'somewhere', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'made', 'believe', 'was', 'truck', 'driver', 'contractor', 'company', 'who', 'suddenly', 'found', 'buried', 'alive', 'acting', 'here', 'amazingly', 'involving', 'asked', 'questions', 'would', 'have', 'asked', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'intensity', 'lost', 'cool', 'right', 'cues', 'Again', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'box', 'hour', 'half', 'believed', 'second', 'it.But', 'what', 'loved', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'aspired', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'thriller', 'help', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'came', 'immediately', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'short', 'movie', 'Most', 'tribulations', 'coffin', 'stem', 'inability', 'cases', 'complete', 'unwillingness', 'contacts', 'rescue', 'capture', 'something', 'less', 'simple', 'search', 'rescue', 'eyes', 'military', 'employers', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'political', 'point', 'have', 'stop', 'wonder', 'something', 'would', 'actually', 'happen', 'Maybe', 'maybe', 'not', 'what', 'life', 'one', 'truck', 'worth', 'company', 'could', 'stand', 'lose', 'millions', 'branch', 'military', 'might', 'be', 'publicly', 'embarrassed', 'incident', 'Good', 'question', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'worked', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'played', 'various', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'showed', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'definitely', 'talent', 'worthy', 'something', 'more', 'odd', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'get', 'nomination', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised']",Buried

This plodding, monotonous fable makes its message clangingly clear:  capitalism is uncannily evil; the U.S. military is diabolical; Westerners are greedy, vulgar, and weak; Middle-Eastern terrorists are simply poverty-stricken people driven to desperation.  And the West will collapse, buried by the symbolic sands of the third world.Worst of all, this film's creators imagine its audience to be so obtuse that its one character is scripted to scream out every dawning revelation that his own wicked employer and incompetent government care not a whit for him and would rather see him die than risk lawsuits and bad publicity.  The presentation of the amorality of these institutions is, in fact, so over-the-top that it totters on the rim of surrealism.Trapped in a primitive wooden box but totally dependent on modern technology, the protagonist utilizes a cell phone, flashlight, glow stick, and lighter.  But does he investigate a snake's burrow that likely leads to the surface or attempt to use a broken board to dig through a presumed three feet of loose, sifting sand?  Alas, there's no American ingenuity in this first-world everyman, who merely downs liquor and nerve pills and waits lamb-like for rescue.

After an attack which leaves his friends dead, he awakens in a crude coffin with a butane lighter and a cell phone which is not fully charged. So begins this movie that is essentially telling the story of Conroy being held hostage for a hefty ransom while waging a battle against time to be rescued and dealing with increasingly irrational captors.Given that Reynolds is the only actor that the audience sees during the film and that his stage is his cramped coffin/wood box, he manages to do a great job as the anxiety filled captive struggling to be rescued. And herein lies my problem. This movie is a nightmare for anyone who is claustrophobic. Reynolds did such a great job adapting to his film environment that I had a problem not feeling confined.The script was clever and not completely predictable. At one point while Reynolds is in a frenzy to be located (remember he has no idea of exactly where he is because he didn't come to until he was already buried) the company he contracted with goes through a protracted process of firing him over his ebbing phone signal so they won't bear any responsibility regarding his kidnapping.

There - this is vital information to know upfront when deciding if you want to spend the seven bucks, and the 94 minutes to see Buried.This information came to my girlfriend and me via my mother over the phone, as we were literally in the car on our way to the theater, when she asked what our evening plans entailed. While this was neither what we were expecting, nor what we were in the mood for - Ryan Reynolds was the sole reason that kept our car heading toward the theater. ""Ryan has never let me down, Mom."" - I explained, praying that history wasn't about to be made. It wasn't.Buried is obviously not a movie for everyone, and I would never have guessed it would be one for me, let alone one of the best films of the year. How could it be? What could possibly happen to a guy in a coffin over the course of 94 minutes that would generate a riveting and flawless film?Well, of course I can't explain that to you. I'll offer you a few minor details, but aside from those and the mention of an Oscar worthy performance from Ryan Reynolds, you'll have to find the rest out for yourself.Reynolds plays Paul Conroy, an independent contractor. We meet him in complete darkness, and after several exasperated shrieks of terror, we get a flicker from his zip lighter and see: Ryan Reynolds, locked in a slightly over-sized coffin. With him, he has a cell phone and a few other items that will also go unmentioned. Paul uses the cell phone to find out why he is in there, to communicate with his loved ones, his captors, people who may be able to help, and so on and so forth.It's wickedly entertaining seeing Paul communicate with people, who spoon-feed us tiny clues about who he is and why this is happening to him, and what will likely become of him. From start to finish, we are with him every step of the way, in real time. We never cut to the FBI or to his wife or his captors. This holds us in a miserable state of claustrophobic suspense, with the character. Oh, and I will tell you, that a critter makes its way into Paul's coffin at one point.The shattering ending blew me away and the film is cleverly written and directed. It has a bunch of well timed comedic elements to it as well, and Reynolds is as brilliant and hilarious as ever. If I had to spend 94 minutes in a cinematic coffin, I can't think of a better actor I'd want to be stuck with.",5,Buried Review,1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,2577,"['BURIEDSTARRING', 'Ryan', 'ReynoldsWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Chris', 'SparlingDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Rodrigo', 'CortesRated', 'RGenre', 'ThrillerRelease', 'Date', '24', 'September', '2010Review', 'Date', '25', 'October', '2010VIRTUALLY', 'THE', 'ENTIRE', 'FILM', 'TAKES', 'PLACE', 'INSIDE', 'A', 'COFFIN', 'vital', 'information', 'know', 'upfront', 'when', 'deciding', 'want', 'spend', 'seven', 'bucks', '94', 'minutes', 'see', 'Buried.This', 'information', 'came', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'phone', 'were', 'literally', 'car', 'way', 'theater', 'when', 'asked', 'what', 'evening', 'plans', 'entailed', 'was', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'what', 'were', 'mood', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'sole', 'reason', 'kept', 'car', 'heading', 'theater', 'Ryan', 'never', 'let', 'down', 'Mom', 'explained', 'praying', 'history', 'was', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', ""wasn't.Buried"", 'obviously', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'guessed', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'How', 'could', 'be', 'What', 'could', 'possibly', 'happen', 'guy', 'coffin', 'course', '94', 'minutes', 'would', 'generate', 'riveting', 'flawless', 'film', 'Well', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', ""'ll"", 'offer', 'few', 'minor', 'details', 'aside', 'mention', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', ""'ll"", 'have', 'find', 'rest', 'yourself.Reynolds', 'plays', 'Paul', 'Conroy', 'independent', 'contractor', 'meet', 'complete', 'darkness', 'several', 'exasperated', 'shrieks', 'terror', 'get', 'flicker', 'zip', 'lighter', 'see', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'locked', 'slightly', 'over-sized', 'coffin', 'cell', 'phone', 'few', 'other', 'items', 'will', 'also', 'go', 'unmentioned', 'Paul', 'cell', 'phone', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'there', 'communicate', 'loved', 'ones', 'captors', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'so', 'so', 'forth.It', 'wickedly', 'entertaining', 'seeing', 'Paul', 'communicate', 'people', 'who', 'spoon-feed', 'tiny', 'clues', 'who', 'why', 'happening', 'what', 'will', 'likely', 'become', 'start', 'finish', 'are', 'step', 'way', 'real', 'time', 'never', 'cut', 'FBI', 'wife', 'captors', 'miserable', 'state', 'claustrophobic', 'suspense', 'character', 'Oh', 'will', 'tell', 'critter', 'way', 'Paul', 'coffin', 'one', 'point.The', 'shattering', 'ending', 'away', 'film', 'cleverly', 'written', 'directed', 'bunch', 'well', 'timed', 'comedic', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'Reynolds', 'brilliant', 'hilarious', 'ever', 'had', 'spend', '94', 'minutes', 'cinematic', 'coffin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'actor', ""'d"", 'want', 'be', 'stuck']",Buried

Reynolds powerfully portrays Paul Conroy, an American truck driver in Iraq who is taken hostage by Iraqi extortionists and buried alive. The movie is about how he desperately tries to survive by making contact with an outside world that includes callous terrorists, cold bureaucrats, non-caring ""friends""/relatives, and the heartless company that hired him to go to Iraq. He is also frustrated by people who are not picking up because they are not at home or are not aware of Conroy's plight.The entire film is shot from the perspective of Conroy, trapped in a coffin. He has a cell phone with camera, a cigarette lighter, and a couple of lights apparently provided by his kidnappers so that he can film a video while he is trapped. Hence, we are able to witness Conroy's terror.Turns out he also has a companion in the coffin.

As a Libra, I'm comfortable taking the middle position. There are some really good and really bad dimensions. Depending upon what you expect or prefer to watch, you will either hate or love it.THE GOODThe acting by the lead character was very good.Also, the voice actors --- WITH ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION -- were good as well.The movie was quite suspenseful. You won't be able to stop watching.The production value was pretty good. You will believe you're in a coffin with the character.THE BADThe movie contained too many political and moralizing dimensions. I did not want nor did I expect these. They really undermined the entertainment value of the film.Some of the political statements were so contrived. For example, there is a recorded conversation in the middle of the film. Listen for ""do we have permission to record this call."" That moment was an example of the film's excessive moralistic political commentary.The movie should have been marketed differently. It is extremely dark. It is also more of a social and political commentary -- rather than a ""thriller.""The ending will disappoint many viewers. I can't say anymore on this subject, but many people will not like it.There is an ""accented"" voice in the film of a character who had some role in placing the lead character in the coffin. The voice does not represent the accent of the region.

It is a very cerebral piece that requires the audience to enter into a place that is terrifyingly desperate, grow to know the many messages that the main character represents, and be willing to experience a very non-Hollywood ending.  Written with great courage by Chris Sparling and directed with consummate skill by young Spanish director Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s, this film is a challenge for the single character in the film and Ryan Reynolds reaches one of the highest achievements of his career.The time is 2006 in Iraq and Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) works for a trucking company as a contracted civilian. His convoy is attacked and many of his fellow non-military workers are killed: Paul is placed in a coffin and buried, with only a cigarette lighter and a cellphone.  The film begins in the dark, that same dark that surrounds the entrapped Paul who realizes he has limited oxygen supply and must find a way to escape or meet death. He tries to use the cellphone, but encounters the usual monstrous difficulties we all face daily - automated answering machines, operators who insist on unnecessary information before helping him, futile attempts to connect with his family, calls from his attackers demanding ransom to set him free, contact with the government departments who shuffle his requests until the appropriate person is reached who is unable to correctly assist, calls from his employer in the States who demands he give a recorded message relinquishing his rights  and firing him for groundless reasons.  Throughout the 90 minutes that we spend with Paul in the coffin we feel the terror, hear the explosions, feel the agony as he speaks briefly with his wife, leaves a cellphone video for his son, and says goodbye to his nursing home mother suffering from dementia.The ending of the film must be withheld, as it is unexpected.  What the writer and the director and the actor have managed to do in this claustrophobic nightmare is point out many facts about the US involvement in the Middle East - both military and civilian contractors - and hear the reasons behind the situation from the Middle Eastern viewpoint.  It is a very difficult movie to experience but one that is a brilliantly condensed statement about the madness of war.  Ryan Reynolds delivers a performance completely solo and manages to create a wholly unforgettable, completely compelling character that will never leave our mind.

At least you hear the voices over the phone, which gets some interesting conversations.Buried is really a tour de force of one man's acting talent. He does an admiral job of convincing you that he will die if he doesn't get help.  His acting pulls you in. You are there with him in the cluster phobic confined area. It builds drama and tension to the climax of the movie.Unfortunately that's all that can be said about this movie. It is not everyone's cup of tea. There are no flashbacks. There is no big budget beyond a casket box and a cell phone. If you want to see Ryan Renolds prove his worth as an actor and what will go down as his greatest performance this is it.",4,Ryan Renolds Greatest Acting Anyone can Aspire to,1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,1186,"['90', 'minutes', 'Ryan', 'Renolds', 'trapped', 'box', 'entire', 'movie', 'should', 'know', 'going', 'Ryan', 'Renolds', 'up', 'trapped', 'box', 'was', 'truck', 'driver', 'Iraq', 'hostile', 'territory', 'convoy', 'was', 'killed', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'shown', 'because', 'again', 'Ryan', 'Renolds', 'trapped', 'box', 'co', 'stars', 'are', 'cell', 'phone', 'lighter', 'cell', 'phone', 'loved', 'ones', 'other', 'people', 'can', 'help', 'full', 'gambit', 'emotions', 'anger', 'sadness', 'love', 'loss', 'least', 'hear', 'voices', 'phone', 'interesting', 'conversations.Buried', 'really', 'tour', 'force', 'one', 'man', 'acting', 'talent', 'admiral', 'job', 'convincing', 'will', 'die', ""n't"", 'get', 'help', 'acting', 'pulls', 'are', 'there', 'cluster', 'phobic', 'confined', 'area', 'drama', 'tension', 'climax', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'big', 'budget', 'casket', 'box', 'cell', 'phone', 'want', 'see', 'Ryan', 'Renolds', 'prove', 'worth', 'actor', 'what', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'greatest', 'performance']",Buried

1349158,A3O1EI68EHBV4B,B003L20IFQ,"Justin Waters ""Synth Pop Lover""","[3, 11]","**SPOILER ALERT**I'm telling you right now, at the beginning of my review, I'm going to reveal what happens at the end of the movie.  And I'm doing so because I'm angry and had I known prior to renting this movie the outcome, I never would have rented it.  So if you want to watch how everything plays out, please move along to another review.Now...I was intrigued by the premise - guy wakes up in a box (coffin), doesn't know how he got in there, is buried with a few items (cell phone, lighter) and must try to figure out a way to escape.  And the entire movie takes place within that confined space.  Okay, I'm with you.  ""Die Hard"" in a box; let's go.Here's what happens in a nutshell - Paul Conroy reaches out to various people on the cell phone (the display is in some Arabic/Farci language, so that's one obstacle), gets put on hold, transferred to voicemail or hung up on (by the way - who doesn't know the main FBI office is in Washington DC?).  He finally reaches the right person to ensure him that they are working on his rescue and are narrowing down a fix on the signal of the cell phone.  Hope springs eternal.The supposed captor calls Paul and tells him $5 million dollars for his release.  The U.S. government refuses to pay.  He is reassured by his one contact that there was a guy in a similar situation who was rescued before and was living his life back in the states.  Great; more hope.The captor sends Paul a video email of his coworker being assasinated, and tells him that his wife and family are next unless Paul sends an email video of him cutting off his own finger.  In desperation, Paul does it.  Pretty grim, but Paul is assurred that his rescuers have pinpointed where he is and to hang on for 3 more minutes.Paul reaches his mother (who has Alzheimers) to have what he knows will be his last conversation with her, and wants to tell her he loves her.  She doesn't remember who he is.Due to explosions above, the box/coffin is punctured and sand begins to filter in and fill up the coffin.  Almost there, you hear the digging going on.  With one bar left on the cell phone, Paul FINALLY gets to speak with his wife (who he hadn't been able to reach on her cell phone throughout the entire movie).  He tells her that he is being rescued, he loves her, he's sorry he has neglected her and that he will be home soon.  She tearfully makes him promise her over and over that he will be home soon and he promises her.  He has to hang up on her because his rescuer is calling him.  He disconnects with her, leaving her with the hope that he'll be home soon to see her and their son.  The rescuer regretfully tells him that they haven't found him after all.  We find out that he lied from before; they actually found the body of the other guy who he said they had rescued and was back at home.  He apologizes.  The sand continues to bury Paul until....he dies.  Black.  Credits roll.Oh, but at least Paul's family back home will receive death benefits from the company Paul was working for in Iraq, so at least they'll be taken care of, right?  Actually, no.  That company called Paul as he was DYING to accuse him of having an affair with his coworker who was assasinated (what basis they had for that decision is never made clear), and because that supposedly breached the contract Paul signed with them, they were firing him.  And because his employment was terminated prior to his death, Paul's family would not receive any benefits.  And let's not forget that since the ransom was not paid, the terrorists (who have Paul's driver's license) know the address of Paul's family and will now go kill them, and will most likely get away with it.Wow, what an inciteful entertaining movie to talk about over dinner afterwards.  Wait a minute - WHAT THE FRIGGIN' EFF???!!!!  ARE YOU FRIGGIN' KIDDING ME??Now look.  Don't give me this crap about not all entertainment has to be happy, Hollywood, ""everything ends up fine"" kind of ending.  I love (and own) ""Molin Rouge"" - didn't have a happy ending.  Thoroughly enjoyed ""American Beauty"" - didn't have a happy ending.And don't go on about how this form of ""entertainment"" was about actually witnessing the emotional and harrowing journey firsthand of how being in this situation would be.  You don't have to spell out for me what it must be like to be eaten by a shark.  I don't need to sit through 90 minutes of seeing some bleed to death from getting their leg caught in a bear trap.  I don't need to see a movie about being a plane that slams into the side of building and everybody dies - I can pretty much imagine that it's not a pleasant experience, and if that scenario is actually worse, why would I want to watch something that's worse than my own imagination?  With the movie ""127 Minutes"", he went through that horrible experience, but at least he escaped and was able to continue living his life!  Where is the payoff of no hope?I will give the movie this - for an entire movie to take place in a confined area like this, the director really has to be imaginative with how the movie is shot, and from that standpoint, he kept it interesting.  And as there were no other visible ""co-stars"" per se (except for a snake...), Ryan Reynolds really had his work cut out for him, and he did a great job as an actor.  And I understand that some foreign directors make movies that have a rather grim opinion of ""entertainment"" (like the laughfest ""Pan's Labyrinthe"").But as far as the general story, if you're going to put the viewer through this, you'd BETTER have some sort of a resolution other than he's placed in that situation AND he dies; otherwise what is the point?  In the movie description, ""Paul has only ninety minutes to be rescued before his worst nightmare comes true.""  Well, his (and everyone else's) worse nightmare DOES come true.  So what lesson do we take away from this movie?  What have we gained from watching this experience?  Here it is - certain Iraqis don't think very highly of Americans, and bad things tend to happen over there.  OH, GEE - REALLY??  I'm pretty sure everyone knows that the world is a horrible place and that these things go on.  I know the reality; I don't need to see something like this unless I can be rewarded with a happy outcome.  That is ""escapism"" which is what entertainment should be.",1,A REAL Review,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,6315,"['**SPOILER', 'ALERT**I', ""'m"", 'telling', 'right', 'now', 'beginning', 'review',

1349162,A7OJ1MOG5NQKL,B003L20IFQ,Mickey Babylon,"[3, 9]","This was compared to Hitchcock by more than a few people at the time of its release. Alfred Hitchcock. Master of suspense.Ryan Reynolds is in a box. That's the whole movie. In fact, it's technically a spoiler, I suppose. He's in a box and he's Ryan Reynolds (which is to say, he effectively plays himself). What about that qualifies as psychological thriller, exactly? Is there anything about Ryan Reynolds' psychology that you didn't pick up fifteen years ago by watching half an episode of ""Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place""? Was there anything about that experience that made you feel that watching him lay in a box for 90 minutes would be ""thrilling""? If not, then you will not find this to be a psychological thriller.Don't worry, there's a subplot. It's a scathing critique of the failures of automated telephone systems. I swear to God... that's the subplot.Oh, and there's a theme, too. Something about corruption of modern government and corporate interests blah, blah, blah. I guess some people like movies that carry a big political message for no apparent reason. Some people like ""Lone Wolf McQuade"". Some people have bad taste.And it's those people, the ones who have bad taste, who are the target with the title of my review. I take no issue with Rodrigo Cortes, the director of this dud. I believe in free art and welcome anyone who wants to make a movie, irrespective of what quality of film they make.Critics, however, which is to say anyone who offered an opinion on this bad boy, should generally just feel ashamed of themselves. Comparisons got made to Hitchcock, and those people are out of their mind. And anyone who heard those comparisons and didn't make sure to redact them are accomplices to insanity. This isn't similar to Alfred Hitchcock. At all. Hitchcock was first and foremost a master of cinematography. This movie takes place in a damn box. There isn't any cinematography. Hitchcock was also a crafter of wild characters, men so outside of our narrow archetypal view of characters that the juxtaposition of the two often taught us something about human behavior. What does Ryan Reynolds teach us, exactly? Don't date Alanis Morisette? I already knew that.My point is just that making such a weak comparison is bad criticism. Critics, good critics, can act as guardians of history in a way. They help us as a culture retain a high standard for greatness, because they appreciate what was great in that which was, and take time to understand why it was great.

This one takes it a step further, moving from a group of actors to a single actor, and eliminating any lead up time to 'the spot' - it starts off right at that moment and continues there until the end. One location, one actor on screen.I thought it was interesting throughout - quite a few unbelievable moments that will have you saying ""Come on, really?"", but still enjoyable. I didn't care for titles like Frozen, partly because of the unrealistic moments, but even with it's share I still enjoyed Buried. Haven't really seen a movie like it before, but it's not a fantastic must-see movie.Acting was good from almost everyone - Ryan Reynolds was very good, some of the people on the phone were trying a bit too hard, but nothing 'bad'.VIDEO QUALITY: A lot of people seem to say ""It's really good.. for a movie filmed inside a dark box!"" which didn't really mean much to me. Does that mean it's ""OK"" looking, or ""GREAT"" looking, not counting the fact it was filmed in a box. After seeing it, I'd have to say ""It's really good.. for a movie filmed inside a dark box!"" ;)Actually, a lot of it will depend on your TV - I had mine calibrated but the ""Black Levels"" set to Light - this worked great in most movies, but was very distracting in this one. You could see the color temperature shifts from post-production (the black would turn a shade of orange or blue, depending which way that scene went), you could also see the artificial brightening in areas such as Ryan's face. It wasn't until I set my TV to ""Black Levels -- Dark"" that it actually looked good, and it looked great! Blacks were very dark, colors were nice, loads of sharpness and some (non-distracting) grain.AUDIO QUALITY: was fantastic - for being in a box, theres a lot of surround sound usage between the actor and the music (which was excellent and pretty creepy).EXTRAS: A short featurette - nothing great, but interesting. The most distracting thing is that it's in Standard Definition, filmed in what appears to be non-anamorphic letterbox (so on an HDTV, you get bars on the top, bottom, left and right) - For a 2011 Blu-Ray, this shouldn't be happening. The Blu-Ray also includes a DVD copy of the film.Overall an interesting movie, very good video/audio quality.

The premise is simple. A civilian truck driver in Iraq wakes up and finds himself buried alive. Because it's shot in real time, every suffocating minute he fights through, we also share in the agony. I must warn you that patience is required. The movie moves along at a decent pace and there is plenty of suspense, but we as the audience experience nothing other than what this unfortunate character is going through. This includes a couple of minutes along the way of staring at a black screen as his various lights go out. Don't worry too much though, because he has a zippo, flashlight, two glow sticks and the faint light from a cell phone to help us see what is going on. The phone also come in handy for dialogue purposes. Why does he have all of these things? Well, I won't ruin it for you.This can easily be dismissed as a gimmicky film, but unlike Open Water and Frozen, where people are trapped in one area for most of the running time, Buried never loses steam and is very believable. I never considered Ryan Reynolds to be a good actor before, though I didn't dislike him, but his acting here is near Oscar nomination worthy. He makes one guy in a box interesting and more importantly, you care about what happens to him. I read the dude got a bald spot and dislocated his shoulder during the 17 days shooting days he spent in that wooden coffin. It would take some big bucks just for me to do that alone, without the whole trying to act while extremely uncomfortable part of the equation. Hopefully this will lead him away from movies like The Proposal and down the path of quality projects in the future.Definitely check it out on DVD, but if it's playing near you, see it on the big screen.

He has a cell phone a lighter, a pencil, a very small flask of alcohol, his anxiety pills, a knife, a flashlight and 2 glow lights (the kind you bend).  His captors are demanding he make a video or pay a ransom of $5 million.The people he is able to make contact with - via the phone - are useless jerks and it's annoying.  The filming is ENTIRELY all in the pine box - you never see anyone else worrying about him or trying desperately to race against the clock to find/save this guy.  Nobody seems to care about him - and guess what - it's kind of hard for you to care about him too.  He's just a guy in a movie.More than halfway thru the movie an asp? travels down his pant leg and finally exits thru a crack in the pine box.  Had it happened earlier in the movie you might have accepted it, but up until that point he'd done a LOT of moving around and would've noticed it shortly after waking up, or noticed it going into his pants in the first place - so it was really stupid how they put that in there.And while he's dying in the box, the company he was working for when he was abducted, phones and records the conversation for legal purposes telling him he was terminated for cause the day before and his family will thereby not be entitled to insurance benefits from his demise.Overall, the film lacks suspense through most of it even though you understand he's in a dire situation.

1349176,A2QDSG599HSWVA,B003L20IFQ,Patrick Wilkinson,"[2, 7]","Where oh where to begin?  ""Buried"" has been widely praised by critics and moviegoers alike.  I have no idea why.  Were they brainwashed during the 94 minute hell hole that is ""Buried""?  Did Ryan Reynolds personally go to each critics house and do their laundry?  This film was poorly written, acted and the third act was not put together well at all.  It's a shame too because the beginning of the film had promise.  I had high hopes for the star Ryan Reynolds based on his impressive performance in ""The Amityville Horror"" remake, unfortunately he didn't deliver in this outing.  This film is the definition of the phrase ""style over substance"".""Buried"" is the story of an American contractor working in Iraq as a driver.  His group is ambushed by supposed terrorists who kill some and kidnap others.  Paul played by Reynolds does not fair so well as he is buried alive in the vast Iraq desert.  The film begins as a black screen with hardly any sound, we start to hear breathing as tension and fear begins to build.  Paul realizes that he's been buried underground with a cell phone, Zippo lighter, knife, flask of alcohol, flashlight and glow-sticks.  His battle begins to find a way out of the grave danger he's in when the kidnappers call demanding a ransom.First, the good things; though they are few.  The decision to film entirely inside the coffin was smart.  It added an extra layer of realism to an already terrifying concept.  ""Buried"" was very well shot and produced as seen in the first act.  It had excellent sound and camera work as well so the tension was genuine.  Director of Photography Eduard Grau gave just enough space between the camera and Reynolds to not overdue the claustrophobic feeling.  The cinematography scored very high points for me, hence the 2/5 instead of 1/5.  The idea of being buried for ransom was new and I appreciated Iraq being the setting.  The first act was intense and fearful as the plot began to come around, but it was ruined with the second and third acts.I mentioned the concept was fresh and new, which I appreciated, but the way in which the plot unfolded was just ridiculous.  There were so many instances that I thought were just completely implausible and unnecessary.  Once Paul finally gets in contact with the State Department, the representative quietly and secretively tells him to contact a group specifically set up in the middle east to deal with kidnap situations.  Why on earth would this information had to have been whispered to Paul?  Why couldn't the State Department just contact them for Paul?  A very unrealistic moment.One of the things left in the coffin for Paul to find was a ""Zippo"" lighter.  He had that thing lit for more than half of the film.  In a low oxygen environment that isn't the best idea.  Not to mention it seemed to have a constant abundance of butane.  Also, when using the cell phone he continued to use the Zippo to light the space in front of him.  Sure this works for the camera lighting but is this realistic? No.Speaking of the cell phone, it was obvious (and told to Paul), that since he was getting a signal he was not that far beneath the surface.  At one point someone says to him that he must not be more than three feet down.  If I were Paul I would have found a way to break through the wood and dig upwards three feet to safety.  So again, unrealistic.Those are just a few examples of why this movie fails.  At one point later in the film I literally felt insulted by the writing.  It is such a shame too because this had high potential to be a unique, intense movie experience.  I can't fault Reynolds completely because I know he has the chops to pull of intense drama but he just was not directed well.  ""Buried"" was made by inexperienced filmmakers and it showed.  It boggles my mind that this is getting such good reviews, specifically from the likes of Roger Ebert.I only need to direct you to the ""100 Things we learned from Buried"" thread on IMDB's message board to see the kind of terrible writing showcased in this film.  See it and form your own opinion.

This movie was reminiscent of the firstSawmovie with that simplicity as well as the feeling of dread and solitude.I would recommend this movie to anyone for impact alone.

I mean, who ever considered that a movie that takes place entirely inside a wooden coffin could be so completely nail biting and truly entertaining? How on earth did the writer and director come up with this let alone put faith in the idea that it could work as a full length feature film? Indeed they must have figured this idea would be a major gamble, but their effort pays off here more than anyone could have expected. Ryan Reynolds, whom I have never heard of gives an ecxcellet performance as a man burried alive in this wooden box who must challenge his will to live and find a way to survive something thay seems impossible to survive. Hes subjected to a lot of mental torment in the process too. Hes buried with only a couple of cell phones, some light sticks, a flashlight and a zippo lighter. As he makes phone call after phone call he pleads with anyone who will listen as he runs out of time to help find and rescue him as he runs out of air and as sand spills in through cracks in the coffin hes been laid to rest in. He may have a chance however because he soon discovers that hes been placed there for ransom and if he does what his captors demand he may have a chance. If he can keep his cell phone battery alive long enough maybe the officials who are trying to find him can track his cellphone signal to where hes burried before its too late. Between Reynolds stellar performance,and Rodrigo Cortss slick direction that makes this story tense and suspensful, this film comes off as a real creepy ride. I got this on Bluray and I am happy I did, because though its very hard to imagine how a film that takes place entirely in a wooden box could ever be all that interesting, but its famtastic and intense all the way through and truly original too.

And to cap it off &#8230; he&#8217;s been buried alive in a coffin. Now that&#8217;s a really bad start to the week.Of course a cynic could reply that that&#8217;s what you get for driving a truck for occupying forces in Iraq. And there&#8217;s some truth in that. On the other hand, one can hardly blame Conroy for being sucked in for working for a firm that is so heartless and amoral it would make Satan blush. Regardless, this is not the time for doling out blame. Conroy has a cell phone to talk with his kidnappers and the outside world, a lighter, and only enough air to last the length of the film, the entirety of which is filmed inside the coffin.It is no small thing to film a powerful one and a half hour suspense solely with one actor in a coffin. (Well in one sense it is a small thing but &#8230; you know what I mean.) Rodrigo Cortes does an outstanding job of directing and Ryan Reynolds does a bang on job playing the only character in the whole dang movie (save those ghostly voices that float in with the cellphone, tantalizingly close and yet agonizingly far). This is one of the boldest, most original films I&#8217;ve seen in years.As I sit and reflect on the experience I surmise that the most effective part of Buried is that it plays off our worst fears. The horror of being buried alive lies deep in our psyche (think of Edgar Allen Poe&#8217;s haunting short story &#8221;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;). But the existential grip of this film doesn&#8217;t stop there. The possibility of being buried alive, if terrifying, remains remote. The more horrifying recognition comes when we see that coffin as a metaphor for our very mortality. Whether we like it or not, each one of us is Paul Conroy, slowly waking up to our own inevitable demise and like him, desperately calling on the phone for somebody &#8212; anybody &#8212; who can help us.randalrauser.com",5,Six feet under before you die,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,1989,"['Paul', 'Conroy', 'not', 'happy', 'man', 'just', 'woken', 'up', 'bloodied', 'disoriented', 'bad', 'headache', 'cap', 'off', '8230', '8217', 'been', 'buried', 'alive', 'coffin', 'Now', '8217', 's', 'really', 'bad', 'start', 'week.Of', 'course', 'cynic', 'could', 'reply', '8217', 's', 'what', 'get', 'driving', 'truck', 'occupying', 'forces', 'Iraq', '8217', 'truth', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'blame', 'Conroy', 'being', 'sucked', 'working', 'firm', 'so', 'heartless', 'amoral', 'would', 'make', 'Satan', 'blush', 'Regardless', 'not', 'time', 'doling', 'out', 'blame', 'Conroy', 'cell', 'phone', 'talk', 'kidnappers', 'outside', 'world', 'lighter', 'only', 'enough', 'air', 'last', 'length', 'film', 'entirety', 'filmed', 'coffin.It', 'small', 'thing', 'film', 'powerful', 'one', 'half', 'hour', 'suspense', 'solely', 'one', 'actor', 'coffin', 'Well', 'one', 'sense', 'small', 'thing', '8230', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Rodrigo', 'Cortes', 'outstanding', 'job', 'directing', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'bang', 'job', 'playing', 'only', 'character', 'whole', 'dang', 'movie', 'save', 'ghostly', 'voices', 'float', 'cellphone', 'tantalizingly', 'close', 'yet', 'agonizingly', 'far', 'one', 'boldest', 'most', 'original', 'films', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'years.As', 'sit', 'reflect', 'experience', 'surmise', 'most', 'effective', 'part', 'Buried', 'worst', 'fears', 'horror', 'being', 'buried', 'alive', 'lies', 'deep', 'psyche', 'think', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', '8217', 'haunting', 'short', 'story', '8221', 'Cask', 'Amontillado', '8221', 'existential', 'grip', 'film', 'doesn', '8217', 'stop', 'there', 'possibility', 'being', 'buried', 'alive', 'terrifying', 'remote', 'more', 'horrifying', 'recognition', 'when', 'see', 'coffin', 'metaphor', 'very', 'mortality', 'like', 'not', 'one', 'Paul', 'Conroy', 'slowly', 'waking', 'up', 'own', 'inevitable', 'demise', 'desperately', 'calling', 'phone', 'somebody', '8212', 'anybody', '8212', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'us.randalrauser.com']",Buried

1349183,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B003L20IFQ,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","Paul Conroy, a private contractor, working as a truck driver in Iraq, wakes up after an ambush to discover he is inside a wooden coffin buried beneath the desert sand. He has nothing but a lighter, a flask with whiskey, some pills and a cell phone provided to him by his captors. He begins to make desperate calls for help as time drags on and his situation becomes more and more dire.This is the premise (and a large portion of the plot) of BURIED, an independent film from Spain, starring Ryan Reynolds in what is essentially a one-man show. It's a tense little thriller that is nearly spoiled by some serious flaws. Reynolds gives a fairly convincing performance as a fairly ordinary guy who begins his ordeal in a panic and only gradually finds his way to calm. At least, he's calm for awhile.The movie is mostly the various conversations he has with the outside world. Grappling with lost signals (and a dying battery), answering machines and a disbelieving bureaucracy. He can't reach his loved ones. He can't convince his captors that he doesn't have $5 million dollars to exchange for his freedom. There's really nothing he can do about his situation...he has no way to break free and must rely entirely on a world of people who aren't quite as motivated as he is.Director Rodrigo Cortes does a good job of finding as many ways of filming the events of the films as he can. His camera swoops around inside the coffin, yet we always have the claustrophobic feeling. The film has a simple premise (sort of in the way that OPEN WATER was a simple, claustrophobic little film), but Cortes and company grab all they can out of it.However, even though we can believe that Conroy would frequently panic and make some bad decisions...he makes too many bad choices. When he does reach people on the phone, he does an unbelievably bad job of convincing them that he really needs their help. I can believe him losing his cool once or twice...but he does it fairly consistently. And when he finally DOES reach someone who might be willing to help, he spends a lot of time sharing unneeded information. He knows his battery is running down, yet he often wastes his breath. It got to the point where I occasionally thought, ""Well, if he dies, he has no one to blame but himself."" (Notwithstanding that he didn't put himself in the coffin.)Worst of all, though...the film manages to take some pretty nasty jabs at the mission in Iraq and make some attempts at moral relativism. One of the folks working to help Conroy, a hostage expert in Iraq, actually tries to explain away the terrorist acts as the work of people who will simply do anything to survive. ""You'd do the same if you were in their situation, Paul,"" this awful man says. REALLY??? If a time comes when the only way I can think to feed my family is to kidnap folks and bury them alive...go ahead and shoot me. To dare suggest that Americans would be just as bad as these terrorist extremists is a mighty big (and offensive) argument for a little thriller to make. For unsubtle, unearned and unsubstantiated political/social statements inserting themselves where they don't belong, BURIED takes the cake.The day after seeing the film, what I remember most is not the tension and excitement and fear...but the bad taste in my mouth from the group of Spanish filmmakers and producers who took pot shots at America.I mention all this, because the film is generally very effective (though not as tense as some other reviews I've read have implied). If you don't mind the politics I mention, by all means enjoy the film. If you find the premise intriguing enough that you think you need to overlook the politics...then you'll have a good time.

And if that is the case - I can understand why.The plot - a contractor is held hostage in Iraq - buried underground in a coffin sized box with a lighter a crappy flashlight and a cell phone with a dying battery.This is grueling, suspenseful, and technically brilliant film making and a least the flms star should have gotten an academy award nomination if not the director.I wondered if the film makers were sometimes aiming for black comedy ala Hitchcock - think along the lines of Frenzy, Psycho and Life Boat.  If so - they should have also listened to Hitchcock describe the cause for his box office flop Saboteur.Buried also reminded me of some of the better aspects of two other clustrophobic trapped people films Shuttle and Open Waters - Spoiler here - both with extremely dark down endings.Buried is a must see for any film maker or aspiring film maker or anyone who craves clever film making and good suspense.  If Hitchcock had made a movie from this script - It could not have been any more suspenseful but if Hitchcock had made it - he would have cut out the propoganda tweaked the ending and maybe his film might not have flopped.Now for the propaganda - and this is not meant to take anything away from the film-making aspects which were all top notch. There is allot of anti-west propaganda in the script for Buried.  For example - There is sympathy for an extremly cruel murdering kidnaper described as ""He's just like you, his family is starving - what would you do on his situation?"" hmmm. And then painting every western company, government agency or person with an American or English accent as either cold blooded or inept or both.The American victim is a very unsympathetic character. He seems to be the cause of his own problems both outside and in the box. (I almost wondered if the film makers relished giving him what he gets - I for one was not on their side) Buried paints the victim as a not to smart American mercenary who drinks, takes anxiety medicine, is an abusive x-husband and is cheating on his present wife and mother of his kids.Had Buried not been so clever, well made and well acted I would have given far less stars for interjecting crappy political propaganda.  Hey - I don't mind when a writer or director are up front about their politics - but please don't sneak it in your film.

1349189,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B003L20IFQ,S. Der,"[0, 1]","CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!Well, I thought this movie was just going to be boring because it's just 1 man in a box buried underneath ground. But, there were good parts in the movie and has an interesting story. I thought the movie was okay at the end.Paul is the main character and only character in the movie. lol Everybody else is talking to him by cellphone. I think Paul is just 3 or 4 feet underground but not 6 feet which has been stated on the slip cover. I think it's like that because 6 feet underground sounds better than 3 or 4 feet. There is actually some action in the movie which is hard to believe. Most of the action is him trying to turn his whole body around from one side to the other side of the box. That's pretty hard to do, if you think about it. There is not much room to move about and turning; Paul does hurts himself doing it. In the movie, Paul did this, when there was a snake with him in the box. The snake came in through a small hole. Paul at one end of the box starts a fire and forces the snake out, and then he quickly turns his body around to stop the fire from burning.I think the the story is pretty good. Paul does everything he can to save his life and protect his family by using everything he has with him, when he is buried underground. I think the movie shows how little and have much a person can do with a cellphone now a days. Make videos, send messages, and talk even with little reception all in the same device. The only thing I didn't like about the ending was that Paul had to cut off his finger. I think he didn't really needed to do that, but it was in the movie. I think they made Paul cut off his finger because it shows what a man will do to protect his family. But, if you think about it long enough there was no need for him to do that. The situation was if he didn't cut off his finger, the terrorists will go and kill his family. The way they build up the situation about the terrorists and how poor and what they want is really money, then it doesn't make sense. They logically cannot get over to America to kill his family. How are they supposedly find a way to enter the country? They have no money! All they know is Paul home address. Paul says they have his driver license and looked at a map. That's all they can do. Even if they find the money to enter the country, the U.S government will not even let people from Iraq go to Michigan without setting off a bunch of red flags. The U.S. government are while aware of Paul and where is from. Letting people from Iraq go to Michigan doesn't make sense. Finally, the terrorists don't even know what his wife or kid looks like. They probably would be long gone by the time the terrorists come here and that's if they get to enter at all. Yup. A snow ball's chance these terrorists could ever think about getting close to the U.S., let alone Michigan. Paul's finger could had been saved!I don't know what to make of the ending when they didn't find Paul but someone else. It would seem like there is a chance that Paul would be saved. But doing that would cause the movie to go longer then it needs to. Also, it will have to explain more things about the situation. If they don't explain things, then a lot of unanswered questions will come up and that will make it a worse movie. So, instead, they end up finding Mark White, which was another person talked about in the movie. Mark White was supposedly was saved already, when he was in Paul's situation. That was a lie of course.

He is buried in Iraq in a wooden box about the size of a coffin. And Reynolds along with little known Director Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s make you feel like you're buried right in there with him. No wait. They make you feel like YOU are the one buried in there alone. It's one of the creepiest feelings that a movie has ever given me. There were literally times where I found myself gasping for breath like I was having a claustrophobia attack or something. It was intense. Reynolds does an absolutely superb acting job in this one-man show and Director Cort&eacute;s keeps what you might preconceive as a boring movie an anxiety filled roller coaster ride.So why only 3 stars, you ask? Well, as effective as the movie was, let's just say I couldn't wait to get out of the box. With a running time of just over 90 minutes, I'd normally say that's a pretty good amount of time to spend with a movie...not too long and not too short. But in this instance it was too much of the same thing for too long. Man in the box. Cell phone. Lighter. Glowstick. And of course extreme desperation as the walls start closing in literally and figuratively.I find myself saying this about a lot of movies lately, but Buried would have been an ideal episode of HBO's now defunctTales from the Crypt. The episodes in Tales were 30 minutes apiece and at that length Buried might have been one of the most memorable episodes in Tales history. But alas, Tales has been off the air for years now so there really is no short form format for directors to present their stories (not that Cort&eacute;s would have chosen a short form format even if it was available). So after 45 minute of Buried, I started watching the Blu Ray disk at 1.5x speed...a pretty cool function of my Blu Ray player that keeps everything pretty normal except it's like everyone just talks really really fast. And there were even a few parts where I sped up the fast forward to 30x because it just got to the point of, ""alright; I get it; man in the box; let's go; does he get out or not?""So would I recommend Buried? Yes, but it was one of the toughest movies to rate in a while. It was too long (2 stars). The acting/directing were excellent (4 stars). The story concept? Pretty dog-gone creepy, current and realistic (3 and a half stars).",3,Man in the Box,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,2402,"[""'m"", 'theMan', 'Box', 'Buried', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'save', 'Save', 'me.Yup', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'movie', 'alright', 'buried', 'Iraq', 'wooden', 'box', 'size', 'coffin', 'Reynolds', 'little', 'known', 'Director', 'Rodrigo', 'Cort', 'eacute', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'buried', 'right', 'wait', 'make', 'feel', 'YOU', 'are', 'one', 'buried', 'alone', 'one', 'creepiest', 'feelings', 'movie', 'ever', 'given', 'were', 'literally', 'times', 'where', 'found', 'gasping', 'breath', 'was', 'having', 'claustrophobia', 'attack', 'something', 'was', 'intense', 'Reynolds', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'acting', 'job', 'one-man', 'show', 'Director', 'Cort', 'eacute', 'keeps', 'what', 'might', 'preconceive', 'boring', 'movie', 'anxiety', 'filled', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride.So', 'why', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'ask', 'Well', 'as', 'effective', 'movie', 'was', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'box', 'running', 'time', 'just', '90', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'normally', 'say', 'pretty', 'good', 'amount', 'time', 'spend', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'too', 'short', 'instance', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'too', 'long', 'Man', 'box', 'Cell', 'phone', 'Lighter', 'Glowstick', 'course', 'extreme', 'desperation', 'walls', 'start', 'closing', 'literally', 'figuratively.I', 'find', 'saying', 'lot', 'movies', 'lately', 'Buried', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ideal', 'episode', 'HBO', 'now', 'Crypt', 'episodes', 'Tales', 'were', '30', 'minutes', 'apiece', 'length', 'Buried', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'Tales', 'history', 'alas', 'Tales', 'been', 'off', 'air', 'years', 'now', 'so', 'really', 'short', 'form', 'format', 'directors', 'present', 'stories', 'not', 'Cort', 'eacute', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'short', 'form', 'format', 'even', 'was', 'available', 'So', '45', 'minute', 'Buried', 'started', 'watching', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disk', '1.5x', 'speed', 'pretty', 'cool', 'function', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player', 'everything', 'pretty', 'normal', 'everyone', 'just', 'talks', 'really', 'really', 'fast', 'were', 'even', 'few', 'parts', 'where', 'sped', 'up', 'fast', 'forward', '30x', 'just', 'got', 'point', 'alright', 'get', 'man', 'box', 'let', 'go', 'get', 'out', 'not', 'So', 'would', 'recommend', 'Buried', 'Yes', 'was', 'one', 'toughest', 'movies', 'rate', 'while', 'was', 'too', 'long', '2', 'stars', 'acting/directing', 'were', 'excellent', '4', 'stars', 'story', 'concept', 'Pretty', 'dog-gone', 'creepy', 'current', 'realistic', '3', 'half', 'stars']",Buried

The only thing that keeps him alive is a cell phone and a lighter and it's up to him to try to get out of this terrible hell he has found himself in.What makes ""Buried"" so good is how suspenseful it is.

1349200,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003L20IFQ,trebe,"[2, 2]","The concept of putting a man in a coffin for the entire length of a film probably sounded insane when it was first pitched, but viewing the finished product, one can't help but admire the brilliance of the writing, and the execution of the screenplay by director Rodrigo Cortes.Ryan Reynolds plays Paul Conroy, a truck driver overseas in Iraq.  His convoy is attacked, and he wakes up buried in a coffin.  Using his lighter for illumination, Conroy is able to see where he is, and is immediately filled with panic, but he finds that he is helplessly trapped.  He discovers there is a cell phone in the coffin, a device that becomes his lifeline to the outside world, and the device that facilitates much of what happens in the film.The writing is quite creative, taking a simple static situation and transforming it into a dynamic and dramatic one, mainly through a series of phone conversations, and a few text messages and videos.  On the screen for almost the entire film, Ryan Reynolds' performance is riveting, and nearly totally convincing, as his character learns that he is being held for ransom by some unknown terrorists.In a maddening series of phone calls, Conroy leaves messages for his wife, his employer CRT, and finally manages to contact a government agency that might be able to help.  Dan Brenner (Robert Paterson) of the Hostage Working Group is very familiar with hostage and ransom situations in Iraq, and offers a faint hope of rescue.  Conroy's captors, whoever they may be, are very experienced at the hostage game, as besides the cell phone, they have provided various articles for him to use, like glow sticks, a flashlight, a knife, and a flask of liquor.  As the ordeal goes on, these articles come into play and are used in various ways.There doesn't appear to be a breathing tube into coffin, so why Paul doesn't suffocate is something that you have to ignore.  Conroy receives a visitor in the form of a small snake, who slithers into the coffin through a hole in the side.  It's completely outrageous, but still electrifying, as death appears to be literally at Paul's feet, until finds a way to convince the serpent to leave.  The action is very much in the moment.  There are no flashbacks or fantasy scenes.  The only time another actor is even seen, is through videos on Conroy's phone.  Even so, the sudden death of a coworker still has all the impact of a blow to the gut.Conroy is intelligent, resourceful, and someone you indentify with and feel sympathy for, as he endures indifference, frustration, and soul crushing heartbreak.  The writing is excellent.  It's quite remarkable how dramatic the phone conversations are just watching Conroy's side of the conversation, and Ryan Reynolds' performance while lying in a darkened confined space, is just amazing.Dan Brenner's voice comes to represent Conroy's primary lifeline.  Unfortunately, although efforts are apparently made, the Government has difficulty locating him.  With the world literally closing in to engulf him, Paul Conroy is a man who is truly screwed.  You truly feel his anger and agony, when his caring employer calls back with some interesting news.  When artillery fire rocks the ground, rattling Paul's teeth, and nearly causing the coffin to collapse, the terrorists who put him in the ground are feared dead.  But there are still a few more surprises ahead for Paul Conroy.Shot in Spain, director Rodrigo Cortes' effort may not be uplifting, but it will probably generate some strong emotions.  Buried is a film that draws you into its world very close, making it more of an experience than most movies.  Although mostly on his back, Ryan Reynolds delivers a tour de force performance, while somehow managing to preserve his personal sanity making the film.Mostly shot in minimal or poor light, getting the Bluray edition probably isn't a priority, although the Bluray/DVD combo pack can often be found for a reasonable price used.  The Bluray edition does contains a featurette that covers some of the behind the scenes goings on, and things like how different versions of the coffin were used in shooting the various scenes in the film.",4,"a brilliantly conceived suspenseful tale, that leaves you gasping for air...",1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,4153,"['concept', 'putting', 'man', 'coffin', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'probably', 'sounded', 'insane', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'pitched', 'viewing', 'finished', 'product', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'brilliance', 'writing', 'execution', 'screenplay', 'director', 'Rodrigo', 'Cortes.Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Paul', 'Conroy', 'truck', 'driver', 'overseas', 'Iraq', 'convoy', 'attacked', 'up', 'buried', 'coffin', 'Using', 'lighter', 'illumination', 'Conroy', 'able', 'see', 'where', 'immediately', 'filled', 'panic', 'helplessly', 'trapped', 'cell', 'phone', 'coffin', 'device', 'lifeline', 'outside', 'world', 'device', 'much', 'what', 'film.The', 'writing', 'quite', 'creative', 'taking', 'simple', 'static', 'situation', 'transforming', 'dynamic', 'dramatic', 'one', 'mainly', 'series', 'phone', 'conversations', 'few', 'text', 'messages', 'videos', 'screen', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'performance', 'riveting', 'nearly', 'totally', 'convincing', 'character', 'being', 'held', 'ransom', 'unknown', 'terrorists.In', 'maddening', 'series', 'phone', 'calls', 'Conroy', 'messages', 'wife', 'employer', 'CRT', 'finally', 'manages', 'contact', 'government', 'agency', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'Dan', 'Brenner', 'Robert', 'Paterson', 'Hostage', 'Working', 'Group', 'very', 'familiar', 'hostage', 'ransom', 'situations', 'Iraq', 'faint', 'hope', 'rescue', 'Conroy', 'captors', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'very', 'experienced', 'hostage', 'game', 'cell', 'phone', 'have', 'provided', 'various', 'articles', 'use', 'glow', 'sticks', 'flashlight', 'knife', 'flask', 'liquor', 'ordeal', 'articles', 'come', 'play', 'are', 'used', 'various', 'ways.There', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'breathing', 'tube', 'coffin', 'so', 'why', 'Paul', ""n't"", 'suffocate', 'something', 'have', 'ignore', 'Conroy', 'visitor', 'form', 'small', 'snake', 'who', 'coffin', 'hole', 'side', 'completely', 'outrageous', 'still', 'electrifying', 'death', 'be', 'literally', 'Paul', 'feet', 'way', 'convince', 'serpent', 'leave', 'action', 'very', 'much', 'moment', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'fantasy', 'scenes', 'only', 'time', 'actor', 'even', 'seen', 'videos', 'Conroy', 'phone', 'Even', 'so', 'sudden', 'death', 'coworker', 'still', 'impact', 'blow', 'gut.Conroy', 'intelligent', 'resourceful', 'someone', 'indentify', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'indifference', 'frustration', 'soul', 'crushing', 'heartbreak', 'writing', 'excellent', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'how', 'dramatic', 'phone', 'conversations', 'are', 'just', 'watching', 'Conroy', 'side', 'conversation', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'performance', 'lying', 'darkened', 'confined', 'space', 'just', 'amazing.Dan', 'Brenner', 'voice', 'represent', 'Conroy', 'primary', 'lifeline', 'Unfortunately', 'efforts', 'are', 'apparently', 'made', 'Government', 'difficulty', 'locating', 'world', 'literally', 'closing', 'engulf', 'Paul', 'Conroy', 'man', 'who', 'truly', 'screwed', 'truly', 'feel', 'anger', 'agony', 'when', 'caring', 'employer', 'back', 'interesting', 'news', 'When', 'artillery', 'fire', 'ground', 'rattling', 'Paul', 'teeth', 'nearly', 'causing', 'coffin', 'collapse', 'terrorists', 'who', 'put', 'ground', 'are', 'feared', 'dead', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'more', 'surprises', 'ahead', 'Paul', 'Conroy.Shot', 'Spain', 'director', 'Rodrigo', 'Cortes', 'effort', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'uplifting', 'will', 'probably', 'generate', 'strong', 'emotions', 'Buried', 'film', 'world', 'very', 'close', 'making', 'more', 'experience', 'most', 'movies', 'mostly', 'back', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'somehow', 'managing', 'preserve', 'personal', 'sanity', 'making', 'film.Mostly', 'shot', 'minimal', 'poor', 'light', 'getting', 'Bluray', 'edition', 'probably', ""n't"", 'priority', 'Bluray/DVD', 'combo', 'pack', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'found', 'reasonable', 'price', 'used', 'Bluray', 'edition', 'featurette', 'scenes', 'goings', 'things', 'how', 'different', 'versions', 'coffin', 'were', 'used', 'shooting', 'various', 'scenes', 'film']",Buried

Ryan Reynolds, as always, is pretty bad as an actor. However, the script and the plot don't help him at all. The film has to many cliches like a cell phone that works, but then doesn't work at the just the right moments, people that put him on hold, etc. For some reason, he is equipped with a lighter, a pen, an empty wallet, and a cell phone. I hear that he has other things in the coffin with him, but I couldn't watch anymore of the film. Most of us would realize that there is a limited supply of air in a coffin, but Reynolds keeps lighting the lighter to make phone calls. The cell phone provides its own light, so why use a lighter every time you make a call? This is one of the many puzzling things that I noticed during the short time that I watched. Also, I can understand that any person would panic if they found themselves locked in a coffin and buried in Iraq of all places, but some things really don't make sense. As a military contractor, he doesn't realize that the U.S. government won't pay ransoms for captured personnel. Also, he seems to want to antagonize everyone he calls to get help. On one call someone asks him for his social security number. He gets angry and starts asking why they want it instead of simply giving it to the person. I mean, how else are they going to be able to identify you as the appropriate person (he lost the security number that was given to him by the contract company). I don't know about you, but if I was given an emergency number to use in case something happened while working in Iraq during a war, I would make sure I memorized it, tattooed it on my skin, and do whatever else I could to make sure it is available in case something happened. In the end, .99 cents is way too much to pay for this movie. I would have been a lot more upset if I paid full price at the movies theatre, but it is just .99. I could have gotten something from the .99 menu at my local fast food joint.

And the cell phone's battery is running very low and is likely to be out of power at any moment. Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is the man, an American truck river who is literally buried alive. In this riveting thriller Paul tries to figure out how to contact the right person to get a help before it is too late.The thrilling film is an admirable feat on the part of the scriptwriter Chris Sparling and the director Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s. They refuse to rely on familiar narrative devices such as flashbacks, making the viewers share the same claustrophobic experiences of being trapped in a wooden box. It is like reading an Edgar Allan Poe short story, a well-told tale of terror that grabs your attention instantly and never lets go.But the real star of the suspenseful film is of course Ryan Reynolds as the buried man. Unique as it is, the film's claustrophobic premise is a tricky thing to get right without capable actors, but his excellent performance almost single-handedly carries the film, of which camera consists of close ups and middle shots. His acting is effective, even in the film's darkly funny moments.The 95 minute thriller is based on a simple concept (one man, one set), brilliantly executed by the entire cast (voices and sound effects play significant roles to enhance the suspense).

1349205,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B003L20IFQ,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 5]","Don't delude yourself with this dreadful drivel!Spanish director Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s and scenarist Chris Sparling take a surefire predicament straight out of the annals of horror writer Edgar Allan Poe about an individual trapped inextricably in a coffin and take it for a grim 21st century spin.  Poe lived in fear that he would appear to die and his apparently lifeless body would prompt authorities to consign him to a coffin.  Later, he would wake up underground with nowhere to go and nobody to save him.  The death-like trance that obsessed Poe is called catalepsy, and America's foremost horror author penned his memorable short story ""The Premature Burial"" about it.  Moviegoers who haven't read the Poe story or seen an adaptation might favorably compare ""Buried"" to either French director George Sluizer's intense abduction chiller ""The Vanishing"" (1988) or his American remake of it with Jeff Bridges in 1993.  The thing that sets the flawed Cort&eacute;s apart from it is that everything occurs in the coffin in ""Buried.""In ""Buried,"" an innocent, average, blue-collar, working-class guy, Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds of ""Blade Trinity""), awakens with a jolt to find himself entombed in a wooden crate buried six feet underground with no way to escape.  Our hero has no idea how he wound up in the coffin.  During a brief inventory, he discovers that he has a Zippo lighter, his Hamilton wristwatch, some glow sticks, a faulty flashlight, a knife, and a Blackberry cell phone with a battery that needs a recharge.  Desperately, Paul tries to contact anybody who can rescue him, but he gets either answering machine messages or busy signals.  Eventually, he contacts a 911 operator, an FBI agent, and later on an Embassy employee with a British accent.  In every instance, he has to indulge his contacts with an explanation about his incredible situation and admittedly gets very rude and profane with them when they ask him imbecilic questions.As it turns out, Paul worked as a civilian contractor driving a truck in Iraq in 2006.  Insurgents attacked his convoy, massacring everybody else, but they spared Paul for something infinitely worse. They took him hostage while he was still unconscious and buried him alive.  Indeed, Paul doesn't know where they have buried him.  The villains give him an ultimatum. Not only must he make a YouTube video with a script written out for him, but he also must raise $5 million for his ransom.  Moreover, Paul has only about two hours to complete this onerous task before he exhausts air in his coffin. Just to emphasize the hopelessness of his predicament, Cort&eacute;s and Sparling reveal that our hero only has $700 in his bank account.  Paul is a nobody with a wife and a young son.Mind you, the suspense and tension that Cortes and Sparling generate is of the intense, white-knuckled variety, and ""Buried"" is pretty gripping until the bottom falls out during last few moments and the tension dissolves in a heartbeat.  There is nothing mesmerizing, brilliant, or groundbreaking about this cynical bit of manipulation.  Worse, Cort&eacute;s and Sparling stick in moments that defy credibility.  At one point, a poisonous black snake slithers out of our protagonist's pants and curls up in the far corner of the coffin.  How did the snake get into the coffin, especially since our doomed hero slams his body around in the enclosure for at least a half-hour or moment in an act of hysterical madness?  The surprise, in a sense, is that the snake didn't bite Paul. The reptile crawls away and never returns.Ultimately, the payoff in ""Buried"" comes as a horrendous letdown.  In a memorable suspense thriller, the filmmakers often reward the audience for their extreme patience, but Cortes and Sparling provide nothing in the way of relief. They provide an ending that serves only to frustrate us for watching a sympathetic character suffer a fate beyond anything that is imaginable. The only catharsis in ""Buried"" is that there is no catharsis, just a cop-out of the most misguided sort.  Indeed, the formula for a good movie involves the use of surprises and reversals.  The ending here qualifies as a surprise, but it is the kind of surprise that makes you wish that you had never seen this movie.Ryan Reynolds does a commendable job of winning our approbation.  Sadly, the protagonist emerges as nothing more than a pawn of corporate America, vengeful Iraqis, and derisive filmmakers.  The company that employed our hero terminates him the day that the insurgents abducted and confined him in the coffin because he had violated a non-fraternization clause.  Apparently, Paul engaged in some kind of relationship with another employee.  ""Buried"" treats its hero with a complete lack of compassion.  You will feel cheated by the depressing ending.  Presumably, Lionsgate did not release ""Buried"" to theaters after they promoted the 95-minute film because studio executives feared that the wretched wrap-up would alienate audiences rather than entertain them.Aside from Reynolds' convincing portrait of claustrophobic hysteria under dire conditions, actor Stephen Tobolowsky makes the greatest impression as CRT company representative Alan Davenport who strings poor Paul along in one scene about a contract violation.  Unless you enjoy movies that paint you into a corner that not even Houdini could have gotten out of, ""Buried"" with its muddled conspiratorial world politics and heavily accented villain is not worth the anxiety.  What could have been a terrific movie turns out to be just a cinematic gimmick about a guy in a box.  Nevertheless, Cort&eacute;s and company produced this low-budget melodrama for $2 million and it has raked in $18-million, making it a hit despite its limited showings.",2,Much Ado A Box

1349208,A1XE2JOZZKMEG6,B003L20IFQ,Wikileaker,"[0, 1]","I've heard too many complaints that this movie is ""just a guy in a box"". It's alot more than that.Ryan Reynolds plays truck driver Paul Conroy, who goes to post-invasion Iraq as a contract worker. The opening scene is total darkness. He lights his lighter and discovers he's in a closed wooden box, little larger than a coffin. It is made clear that he has no idea where he is or how he got there. He discovers a cellular telephone, and the story is off to his quest of finding out about his situation and how to get someone to find him and dig him out.I'm not going to give away the suspenseful plot turns; I will just cut right to the ending, which I found somewhat unsatisfactory. So if you don't want to know how the movie ends, quit reading here.In the end, Paul's box fills with sand and he suffocates. The part I found unsatisfactory was that he could have made a last-ditch attempt to get himself out since -- this is important -- it is apparent from his conversations on the cell phone that he's only buried about 3 feet under. If he could have gathered his feet under himself, or even just his knees, he just might have wriggled his way out (important: the panels of the box's top were broken from the weight of the sand, that's how the box was filling in). I know that may sound unlikely, but Paul is a young, strong man, he's fighting for his very life, and it's just sand, not packed earth. Anyway, he didn't even try, which made for a disappointing ending.One way many have described the movie is that it's just a guy in a box talking on a cell phone for 90 minutes before he finally dies. Well, I'm not going into details, but his effort to get somebody on that telephone who can help him made for quite an interesting story.

Well, someone thought it would be a great idea to make a movie built around that concept but instead of putting the frustrated caller in the comforts of his own living room, they put him inside of a coffin  along with a cell phone and buried him. That pretty much sums up this yawner of a movie.The number of characters are very limited in this movie and the main character is played by Ryan Reynolds. He is just not a strong enough actor to carry a movie that involves such a small number of characters. I never had the sense that he was actually in any real danger and a better actor could have at least projected this feeling to the viewer.What makes this movie even worse than the plot is the fact that it is hard to even care about the main character. You can almost imagine many scenarios that would have led him to his predicament and most of them developing from situations he probably created with his own mouth. Oh, you will identify with him only because you will recognize the frustrating telephone scenarios but you will probably identify more with the person on the other end of the line.Well, at least this film has some good laughs. Too bad that the laughs all have to deal with the coffin obviously growing and shrinking throughout the movie. It appears that the main character can barely move around in the coffin one minute and in the next minute, the coffin looks big enough to play 18 holes of golf inside of it.This is simply not a good movie. Now, I will place you on hold while you are directed to a movie that is more palatable.",2,He Was Buried Alive In This Movie and I Didn't Care,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,1709,"['know', 'how', 'frustrating', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'call', 'customer', 'service', 'department', 'various', 'utility', 'companies', 'retail', 'stores', 'large', 'corporations', 'right', 'Well', 'someone', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'idea', 'make', 'movie', 'built', 'concept', 'instead', 'putting', 'frustrated', 'caller', 'comforts', 'own', 'living', 'room', 'put', 'coffin', 'cell', 'phone', 'buried', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'yawner', 'movie.The', 'number', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'limited', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'just', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'actor', 'carry', 'movie', 'small', 'number', 'characters', 'never', 'had', 'sense', 'was', 'actually', 'real', 'danger', 'better', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'projected', 'feeling', 'viewer.What', 'movie', 'even', 'worse', 'plot', 'fact', 'hard', 'even', 'care', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'almost', 'imagine', 'many', 'scenarios', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'predicament', 'most', 'developing', 'situations', 'probably', 'created', 'own', 'mouth', 'Oh', 'will', 'identify', 'only', 'will', 'recognize', 'frustrating', 'telephone', 'scenarios', 'will', 'probably', 'identify', 'more', 'person', 'other', 'end', 'line.Well', 'least', 'film', 'good', 'laughs', 'Too', 'bad', 'laughs', 'have', 'deal', 'coffin', 'obviously', 'growing', 'shrinking', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'barely', 'move', 'around', 'coffin', 'one', 'minute', 'next', 'minute', 'coffin', 'big', 'enough', 'play', '18', 'holes', 'golf', 'it.This', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'Now', 'will', 'place', 'hold', 'are', 'directed', 'movie', 'more', 'palatable']",Buried
