I saw the first Amnesty International concert in Zimbabwe, whenever it was - I think the late 80s or early 90s. It was hosted in Zimbabwe but aimed at a South African audience - but for political reasons (it was still the apartheid days) couldn't play in South Africa - in fact, South Africa was no doubt one of the targets of the Amnesty concert.For those like myself who attended, one of the most infamous aspects of the concert was the eight hours it took standing in the broiling heat to get through the Zimbabwe border post. However, it was worth it: it was one of the most fantastic concerts I've ever been to - I'd never expected to see Bruce Springsteen live. I thought Sting and to a lesser degree Peter Gabriel were excellent, but they were totally blown away by Springsteen.And this is what I thought I was buying. I never knew there was a second tour, and the price label blocked the concert date on the packaging. I couldn't remember many of the other artists, so didn't realise it was a different concert, and where I did see artists that I knew I hadn't seen - like Plant/Page - I thought maybe they'd attended Paris but not Zimbabwe. However, I fully realised my error when Springsteen came on and played his down-tone boring renditions compared to the feverish display he'd given in Zim.It may be a great cause, but I've never brought myself to watch the whole show through, as most of the artists don't resonate with me, and the ones that do - well, I have far better concert performances by them to watch instead.",4,My mistake!,1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,1624,"['do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'production', 'reasons', 'are', 'entirely', 'own', 'fault', 'saw', 'first', 'Amnesty', 'International', 'concert', 'Zimbabwe', 'whenever', 'was', 'think', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'was', 'hosted', 'Zimbabwe', 'aimed', 'South', 'African', 'audience', 'political', 'reasons', 'was', 'still', 'apartheid', 'days', 'could', ""n't"", 'play', 'South', 'Africa', 'fact', 'South', 'Africa', 'was', 'doubt', 'one', 'targets', 'Amnesty', 'concert.For', 'who', 'attended', 'one', 'most', 'infamous', 'aspects', 'concert', 'was', 'eight', 'hours', 'took', 'standing', 'broiling', 'heat', 'get', 'Zimbabwe', 'border', 'post', 'However', 'was', 'worth', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'fantastic', 'concerts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', ""'d"", 'never', 'expected', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'live', 'thought', 'Sting', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'were', 'excellent', 'were', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'Springsteen.And', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'buying', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'second', 'tour', 'price', 'label', 'blocked', 'concert', 'date', 'packaging', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'many', 'other', 'artists', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'was', 'different', 'concert', 'where', 'did', 'see', 'artists', 'knew', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Plant/Page', 'thought', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'attended', 'Paris', 'not', 'Zimbabwe', 'However', 'fully', 'realised', 'error', 'when', 'Springsteen', 'came', 'played', 'down-tone', 'boring', 'renditions', 'compared', 'feverish', 'display', ""'d"", 'given', 'Zim.It', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'cause', ""'ve"", 'never', 'brought', 'watch', 'whole', 'show', 'through', 'most', 'artists', 'do', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'ones', 'do', 'well', 'have', 'far', 'better', 'concert', 'performances', 'watch', 'instead']",Paris Concert for Amnesty International

First, you can't slag this off because of the very important cause the show is for, its like being upset with the biker gangs who give toys for sick children to the hospitals, you may dislike bikers, but they're giving toys to sick kids man!  So, that being said, some of this music is great and some not so great.  I appreciate that there is a diverse offering in the performers on this, that is always cool, even if you don't like them all.  My favorite performance from this is without a doubt Mr. Plant and Mr. Page.  They just RIP on this!  Yes, they're older, if you can't handle classic rock or ""old man"" rock, then you won't dig this, just remember all you fans who said Radiohead was BRILLIANT on this, they themselves will be ""old man"" rock some day, and then what will you say?  hmmm?!  Jimmy and Robert got together for two excellent tours in the late 1990's, and this is the only official material released on video from the second outing where they were just the power trio with singer format.  They were fantastic, and the Parisian crowd rocks out with them!  So, check it out if you dare, just remember, this is for Amnesty International, not just a concert.

462916,A13FBTZ8SO8T3D,6305394784,o dubhthaigh,"[3, 6]","This concert is basically a Peter Gabriel showcase that unfortunately casts Gabriel and a number of high profile &quot;stars&quot; in a less than flaterring light. It has all the overproduced lustre of an awards show, including noxious blabbering by some official from Amnesty, a few Gabriel influenced animations and a sense that this had the element of social contract obligation to it.But it has its moments: Tracy Chapman is terrific and delivers the goods, as does Kassiv, a Latin group that is on fire from the start. However, Springsteen is in Tom Joad laconic low gear and while he presents well worn songs in a different light, he just never connects. This seems to be about him asserting his good intentions and rightful conscience. Youssou N'Dour gives it his best, but when Gabriel joins him, it is poorly choreographed, a bit too cliched, and in general deflating to the energy N'Dour seemed to be msutering. His &quot;7 Seconds&quot; at the end of the concert lays an egg, for a lot longer than 7 seconds. Mic problems abound and syncing the lips and the music never quite match up.Gabriel is a disappointment throughout. Apart from previewing his song from UP, he just never seems to be that into the performance, and having been absent a good while by this time, it is a bit jarring to see how he seems to have let himself slip into beer-belly middle age. He reminds me of a computer consultant wondering where the cheapest pizza is. Kofi Annan makes his appearance, coincidentally not long after having visited Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. I have always found Annan a bit of a joke, and while I am sure he harbours righteous thoughts, his disconnect with reality has always struck me as subverting what he should be standing for.In fact, the only real dynamic appearance on this tape comes from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, and he is absolutely un-self-absorbed, which in comparison to a number of other performances, stands out all the more clearly. He has a simple and direct message that connects with peole who have no real interest in anything other than the music. What I found humourous though is that, although in Paris, he addresses the crowd in English, as does the British woman who seems to fawn all over every celebrity.All in all, it's entertaining, a bit of an infomercial, but Chapman and His Holiness give it a little something extra that basically redeem the effort.",3,"LESS THAN COMPELLING, BUT FOR THE DALAI LAMA",1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,2400,"['concert', 'basically', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'showcase', 'unfortunately', 'Gabriel', 'number', 'high', 'profile', 'quot', 'stars', 'quot', 'less', 'flaterring', 'light', 'overproduced', 'lustre', 'awards', 'show', 'including', 'noxious', 'blabbering', 'official', 'Amnesty', 'few', 'Gabriel', 'influenced', 'animations', 'sense', 'had', 'element', 'social', 'contract', 'obligation', 'it.But', 'moments', 'Tracy', 'Chapman', 'terrific', 'goods', 'Kassiv', 'Latin', 'group', 'fire', 'start', 'However', 'Springsteen', 'Tom', 'Joad', 'laconic', 'low', 'gear', 'well', 'worn', 'songs', 'different', 'light', 'just', 'never', 'be', 'asserting', 'good', 'intentions', 'rightful', 'conscience', 'Youssou', ""N'Dour"", 'best', 'when', 'Gabriel', 'poorly', 'choreographed', 'bit', 'too', 'cliched', 'general', 'deflating', 'energy', ""N'Dour"", 'seemed', 'be', 'msutering', 'quot', '7', 'Seconds', 'quot', 'end', 'concert', 'egg', 'lot', 'longer', '7', 'seconds', 'Mic', 'problems', 'abound', 'syncing', 'lips', 'music', 'never', 'quite', 'match', 'up.Gabriel', 'disappointment', 'Apart', 'previewing', 'song', 'UP', 'just', 'never', 'be', 'performance', 'having', 'been', 'absent', 'good', 'while', 'time', 'bit', 'jarring', 'see', 'how', 'have', 'let', 'slip', 'beer-belly', 'middle', 'age', 'computer', 'consultant', 'wondering', 'where', 'cheapest', 'pizza', 'Kofi', 'Annan', 'appearance', 'coincidentally', 'not', 'long', 'having', 'visited', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'Baghdad', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'Annan', 'bit', 'joke', 'am', 'sure', 'righteous', 'thoughts', 'disconnect', 'reality', 'always', 'struck', 'subverting', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'standing', 'for.In', 'fact', 'only', 'real', 'dynamic', 'appearance', 'tape', 'Holiness', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'absolutely', 'un-self-absorbed', 'comparison', 'number', 'other', 'performances', 'out', 'more', 'clearly', 'simple', 'direct', 'message', 'peole', 'who', 'have', 'real', 'interest', 'anything', 'other', 'music', 'What', 'found', 'humourous', 'though', 'Paris', 'crowd', 'English', 'British', 'woman', 'who', 'fawn', 'celebrity.All', 'entertaining', 'bit', 'infomercial', 'Chapman', 'Holiness', 'give', 'little', 'something', 'basically', 'redeem', 'effort']",Paris Concert for Amnesty International
