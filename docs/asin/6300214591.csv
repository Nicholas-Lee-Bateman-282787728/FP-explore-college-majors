213819,A3MFGOKZO3CH63,6300214591,Andrea Gidusko,"[4, 6]","Michael Keaton has been my favorite actor since I was seven years old and was first introduced to him in ""Night Shift"" and ""Mr. Mom."" Since then I have seen and own every movie he has made and this one is definitely in the top five.We all know Ron Howard is a great director, and he finally got his award this year for ""A Beautiful Mind,"" and I do believe that this is one of his best films ever. Even though this movie was made in 1986 it still hits home today. With our weakened economic state we can relate to local businesses closing down and having to look overseas for help.There isn't much I can say about this movie that others already have, other then the fact that I do not believe it truly stereotypes anyone, all it really does is point out some hard truths. A lot of American workers are lazy, they do come in ten minutes late and leave ten minutes early, and at the same time too many Japanese workers care too much about work and not enough about their families. What this movie shows is the understanding of these sad facts and people working to overcome them, and people from different cultures becoming friends and working together to achieve one common goal.This movie isn't just about making cars, it's about learning to make the necessary changes in our attitudes to get along and succeed. Not to mention it's extremely funny thanks to Michael, Gedde Wantanabe (Yes, ""Long Duk Dong"" from ""Sixteen Candles"", George Wendt, John Turturro, Mimi Rogers, Rick Overton and Ron's brother Clint and father Rance.

Sure, the characters are sterotyped almost to an extreme, but I have worked with both cultures (both a union blue collar, and a white collar-international based one), and there is a grain of truth to each.  The movie had to be exagerated to show more impact, and coming together for the ""hollywood effect"".  The head of the company Oishi Kazihiro played by Gedde Watanabe was my absolute favorite character in the movie, very human, great delivery of some of his lines, and just a good role.  George Wendt did a good job as ""a regular joe"", much like his Norm character on Cheers.  Michael Keaton's role displayed much of the turmoil a midlevel supervisor has to go through.

213822,AUHG8KSHI529U,6300214591,Craig Matteson,"[28, 31]","This movie is now 20 years old.  It is an interesting comedy for what it says about how the Japanese and American cultures were trying to learn to work together in a world economy.  Americans were not used to being on the losing end of competition, quality, and efficiency.  And they tended to see themselves as entitled to their well paying unskilled jobs.  The movie exaggerates these traits, but having worked on an assembly line for a couple of years, I can tell you that the exaggerations are still based in reality back in the 1970s and 1980s.  The Japanese are portrayed as being all about company, ruthless bargainers, and relentless perfectionists.  I particularly liked the way the Japanese are shown saying things about hearing what the Americans are saying and the Americans taking it to mean agreement while the Japanese mean no such thing.The movie doesn't take sides and shows most of the problems coming from fear and misunderstanding.  Isn't that really what happened?  In the 1980s Americans feared the Japanese dominance of our economy and it resulted in some extreme actions and reactions.  Nowadays, we fear the Chinese in a different way, but their dominance of basic manufacturing is more complete than the Japanese ever were and yet there isn't the same kind of backlash.  Why?  Well, that is outside the scope of this little review.  Maybe it is experience with losing certain kinds of manufacturing for decades.  Maybe it is because the auto industry was seen as particularly American and the high end of unskilled labor as middle class.  Maybe it is because we now see economy successfully adapting as some new job classes are created and others leave.  Maybe it is something else.Michael Keaton is fine as a man trying to save his town, but makes lots of mistakes in dealing with both sides.  Still, he wins in the end.  However, I believe it is Gedde Watanabe who makes the movie work.  He has to be Japanese enough to be a threat while still being enough outside the mainstream Japanese culture that Americans feared in order to be sympathetic.  He has many well done moments in the film and I enjoy him whenever I see him on the screen.  Really, he should work even more.George Wendt was the big name at the time with the huge success of Cheers since 1982.  He represents the old American labor and has one of his least sympathetic roles, especially when he knocks down the even more unsympathetic Japanese manager (well played by Sab Shimono) and thereby shifts our sympathy to the Japanese.  A neat plot trick.  We also get to see the generational gap between the post World War II generation that lifted Japan from utter ruin to a world economic power in only a few decades, and the younger managers who don't feel they can say anything, but do want to be with their families (as shown in the birth of the daughter to Ito (Rodney Kageyama does a terrific job in a few small scenes.  He adds a lot to the film).We have learned a lot about working in a global economy since 1986.  The Japanese have certainly suffered through their own terrible economic problems.  I am glad the movie showed a positive ending with the two cultures forming an ability to work together even with much left to learn and work through.While much has changed, the movie still holds up pretty well.  But young people who never knew the paranoia of Japan from the 1980s might need to have some things explained to them.",4,Still holds up well after 20 years.

213824,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,6300214591,Donald M. Bishop,"[3, 4]","Michael Keaton gave one of his best performances in this film about the Japanese takeover of an ailing auto plant in Pennsylvania.  It is a ""comedy"" that has a serious side too.  This 1986 film reflected the anxiety Americans then felt about economic competition from Japan.  That the anxiety has now passed should not keep anyone from watching, laughing, and enjoying the film -- and thinking about its themes.One theme is ""us"" vs. ""them"":  The new Japanese managers and the American workers both think everything will be fine when the others change.  This moderates (for the characters in the story, and for the film viewer) as the story unfolds.  It diminished by the end of the film when the Japanese managers and the American workers have come, at least part way, to understanding one another.It is now more than 20 years since the film was released.  Japanese companies have now built and managed many American auto factories.  American businesses have now embraced many ""best practices"" they learned from Japanese management.  And Americans buy Toyotas, Nissans, and Hondas because of the Japanese commitment to quality and zero defects that sparked conflict on the assembly line in the film.""Gung Ho"" has a number of verbal and sight gags -- like the town of Hadleyville turning out (Chinese) dragon dancers to greet the new Japanese management team at the airport.  Another is Japanese managers saying one thing, with Michael Keaton hearing something different.  Murray Chapman's screenplay was quite skillfully written.To my mind, though, the most interesting dimension of the plot and Michael Keaton's performance was to highlight the difficult situation of the person who moves (or negotiates or mediates) between cultures, especially at the beginning when the two cultures/companies/parties don't know much about one another.  In the plot, Keaton tried to finesse the differences with the force of his own personality.  It worked for awhile, but it wasn't sustainable in the end.  The film could be profitably viewed in training sessions that deal with intercultural negotiation, change, binational meetings, and joint ventures.-30-",5,Michael Keaton between two cultures:  the good laughs can prompt a lot of thinking,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,2145,"['Michael', 'Keaton', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'Japanese', 'takeover', 'ailing', 'auto', 'plant', 'Pennsylvania', 'comedy', 'serious', 'side', 'too', '1986', 'film', 'reflected', 'anxiety', 'Americans', 'then', 'felt', 'economic', 'competition', 'Japan', 'anxiety', 'now', 'passed', 'should', 'not', 'keep', 'anyone', 'watching', 'laughing', 'enjoying', 'film', 'thinking', 'themes.One', 'theme', 'new', 'Japanese', 'managers', 'American', 'workers', 'think', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'when', 'others', 'change', 'characters', 'story', 'film', 'viewer', 'story', 'unfolds', 'diminished', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Japanese', 'managers', 'American', 'workers', 'have', 'come', 'least', 'part', 'way', 'understanding', 'one', 'another.It', 'now', 'more', '20', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Japanese', 'companies', 'have', 'now', 'built', 'managed', 'many', 'American', 'auto', 'factories', 'American', 'businesses', 'have', 'now', 'embraced', 'many', 'best', 'practices', 'learned', 'Japanese', 'management', 'Americans', 'buy', 'Toyotas', 'Nissans', 'Hondas', 'Japanese', 'commitment', 'quality', 'zero', 'defects', 'sparked', 'conflict', 'assembly', 'line', 'film', 'Gung', 'Ho', 'number', 'verbal', 'sight', 'gags', 'town', 'Hadleyville', 'turning', 'out', 'Chinese', 'dragon', 'dancers', 'greet', 'new', 'Japanese', 'management', 'team', 'airport', 'Japanese', 'managers', 'saying', 'one', 'thing', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'hearing', 'something', 'different', 'Murray', 'Chapman', 'screenplay', 'was', 'quite', 'skillfully', 'written.To', 'mind', 'though', 'most', 'interesting', 'dimension', 'plot', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'performance', 'was', 'highlight', 'difficult', 'situation', 'person', 'who', 'mediates', 'cultures', 'especially', 'beginning', 'when', 'two', 'cultures/companies/parties', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'one', 'plot', 'Keaton', 'tried', 'finesse', 'differences', 'force', 'own', 'personality', 'worked', 'awhile', 'was', ""n't"", 'sustainable', 'end', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'profitably', 'viewed', 'training', 'sessions', 'deal', 'intercultural', 'negotiation', 'change', 'binational', 'meetings', 'joint', 'ventures.-30-']",N/A

Lots of people can remember when there was a general panic  that the Japanese would take over the car business and that every person in America would be driving a Japanese car.Gung Ho is the story of a man, Michael Keaton, who is sent to Japan to encourage the Japanese to re-open a car factory in his dying town. Japanese efficiency clashes with the American ""do it the way I like"" attitude and it soon comes down to a showdown of producing 15,000 cars or loosing the factory.Gung Ho is definitely a product of its time. American auto workers couldnt understand the ""work-a-holic"" attitude of the Japanese and the Japanese couldnt understand the American attitude of putting their company second or third on their priority list. Director Ron Howard trys to put a comical spin on the ""East v.s.

213836,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6300214591,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","An early Ron Howard comedy ""Gung Ho"" stars Michael Keaton as Hunt Stevenson, a former automobile factory foreman in Hadleyville, Pennsylvania, who is tasked to convince a Japanese automobile maker ""Assan"" (not Nissan) to reopen the town's plant. It is a task upon which the fate of the town rests.Hunt somehow succeeds, but a real challenge arrives in the form of culture clash between American workers and Japanese management methods. First, you don't listen to the music when you are working. Don't read newspapers when you are working. And....The film certainly reflects the US-Japan relationship in the 1980s, but don't expect insightful observations about culture differences. ""Gung Ho"" is basically a comedy, with a Frank Capra-like story where all things work out.This is Michael Keaton at his best. Gedde Watanabe is also good as an uptight Japanese executive Kazuhiro, who forms friendship with Hunt. Unfortunately, most supporting characters including Mimi Roger's love interest are forgettable. John Turturro also appears, but his role is not a big one.Sometimes they make ""East-Meets-West""-type culture clash comedies (like ""Mr. Baseball""), and ""Gung Ho"" is one of them. (Interestingly, the film was not theatrically released in Japan, while ""Mr. Baseball"" was.)

213837,A4YXKE5F62II8,6300214591,Visual Bureau,"[1, 1]","""America's stronghold in industry and business skills is funny, sharp, and timely for what is and Gung Ho!, among many 1980s comedies, was not the film that got the most attention but it was the film (commercially, of course) with the most satirical elements and pizzazz.Michael Keaton plays a hot-shot businessman and union leader/organiser who wants to make a deal with a Japanese automotive company Assan Motors (a probable pastiche of Nissan/Datsun) to bring more revenue and workers. His intentions get the best of him when his ego inflates and the Japanese wiggle their way around American workers' demands for lower pay but higher productivity. The film could be a classroom case in economics and it serves it with some intriguing Hollywood moments involving confrontations and scenes where the Japanese executives are punished and undergo a training programme. While the film is not widely appreciated by many (35% on Rotten Tomatoes), it actually is more compelling than what it comes across as. I found a lot of it quite enjoyable and the moments where we see Keaton's character just being an #*$&$&! and his doubtful colleagues (including an early John Turturro) are well-done and relatable performances.Ron Howard's done himself a good job here and even with the corny '80s kitsch, it actually feels more like a feel-good social commentary comedy than a screwball, sex farce like the ones you see these days (I admit, The Hangover is just not funny but one over-hyped crud-maker). But with the feel-good element comes the concern that this film would not be picked up if it badmouthed America and given the Reagan-era anti-Soviet/anti-Communist sentiment that entailed, the film loses some of its credibility for coming across as a bit idealistic rather than realistic but its aims are more complete and appropriate (bringing two sides to the argument) than a propaganda piece like (left-wing) Furry Vengeance or The Day After Tomorrow or (right-wing) Atlas Shrugged or Top Gun.If you think you like this film but want to know more about automotive business (esp. in Michigan) and workers' rights, try out Roger & Me, Michael Moore's feature debut before he went out as a ultra left-wing celebrity.""",4,Cross-cultural comedy about automotive industry between Japan and America is funny and interesting yet cliched.,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,2211,"['America', 'stronghold', 'industry', 'business', 'skills', 'funny', 'sharp', 'timely', 'what', 'Gung', 'Ho', 'many', '1980s', 'comedies', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'got', 'most', 'attention', 'was', 'film', 'commercially', 'course', 'most', 'satirical', 'elements', 'pizzazz.Michael', 'Keaton', 'hot-shot', 'businessman', 'union', 'leader/organiser', 'who', 'make', 'deal', 'Japanese', 'automotive', 'company', 'Assan', 'Motors', 'probable', 'pastiche', 'Nissan/Datsun', 'bring', 'more', 'revenue', 'workers', 'intentions', 'get', 'best', 'when', 'ego', 'inflates', 'Japanese', 'wiggle', 'way', 'American', 'workers', 'demands', 'lower', 'pay', 'higher', 'productivity', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'classroom', 'case', 'economics', 'intriguing', 'Hollywood', 'moments', 'involving', 'confrontations', 'scenes', 'where', 'Japanese', 'executives', 'are', 'punished', 'undergo', 'training', 'programme', 'film', 'not', 'widely', 'appreciated', 'many', '35', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'actually', 'more', 'compelling', 'what', 'found', 'lot', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'where', 'see', 'Keaton', 'character', 'just', 'being', '*', 'doubtful', 'colleagues', 'including', 'early', 'John', 'Turturro', 'are', 'well-done', 'relatable', 'performances.Ron', 'Howard', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'even', 'corny', 'kitsch', 'actually', 'more', 'feel-good', 'social', 'commentary', 'comedy', 'screwball', 'sex', 'farce', 'ones', 'see', 'days', 'admit', 'Hangover', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'one', 'over-hyped', 'crud-maker', 'feel-good', 'element', 'concern', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'badmouthed', 'America', 'given', 'Reagan-era', 'anti-Soviet/anti-Communist', 'sentiment', 'entailed', 'film', 'credibility', 'coming', 'bit', 'idealistic', 'rather', 'realistic', 'aims', 'are', 'more', 'complete', 'appropriate', 'bringing', 'two', 'sides', 'argument', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'left-wing', 'Furry', 'Vengeance', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'right-wing', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'Top', 'Gun.If', 'think', 'film', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'automotive', 'business', 'esp', 'Michigan', 'workers', 'rights', 'try', 'out', 'Roger', 'Me', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'feature', 'debut', 'went', 'out', 'ultra', 'left-wing', 'celebrity']",N/A
