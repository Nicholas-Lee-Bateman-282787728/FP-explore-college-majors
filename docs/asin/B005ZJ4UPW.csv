1505869,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B005ZJ4UPW,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[3, 3]","I was a 22-yr old young man (going on 23), when I, like millions of peopleacross the country, witnessed R. Budd Dwyer's dramatic & riveting final speechat a televised press conference that he had called. During this time, a lot of dirtypoliticians were being caught with their hands in the cookie jar, on every levelof government, and people were very jaded about it by then.So, when this man committed suicide at the end of his speech,and quite gruesomely I may add, many thought that he was justanother grimy politician who got caught, and rather than face hiscomeuppance, decided to exit in grand shocking style!A month or so later, the world had moved on to other news and events.But that was before the internet.As the years went on though, I would, every now and then,for some reason, think of the politician who killed himself on national television.I began to research the case on the internet, and like many, I have seen the uncensoredversion of Dwyer's final press conference and suicide a few more times than I'd like to admit.Just strange & morbid human curiosity I guess...though I never felt as though it were fodderfor snarky humor, as many in the later generations would.I always thought it was very tragic.That's the funny thing about truth, it kind of just calls out to us who are inclined to seek it out.That's what made me immediately interested in purchasing the video on-demand versionof this documentary (for my kindle) when I found out about it.I was very impressed by this film; the interviews with Dwyer's family and friends,who all never waivered in their position that this man was nothing less than honorableand totally innocent of all of the charges that were brought against him by his political enemies.Instead of seeing it (his death) the way I did as young man, this documentary changed my wholeperception of it, and became even more of a tragedy to me.I felt bad for taking on the thinking of the herd...as we so often do when we are young & dumb.Dwyer didn't take the coward's way out....He was an honest man, a good family man, and rare true blue politician from a by-gone era,who actually wanted to help his fellowman, had served as an educator in his youth, andreally was an innovator to the office which he had served before his death.He was a man who was broken, severely depressed, and had been raked over the coals.To save the pensions that he had worked so hard for, to ensure his family's financialsecurity, and to, (in his head), shine the light on what had happened to him,R. Budd Dwyer did what he did...for better or for worse.Again, this documentary was well done, and it opened my mind and changedmy whole opinion and perception of the haunting events that lead to what happenedon national TV, 26 years ago.  And now, as saying goes....I KNOW.",5,"Excellent Profile of A Decent Man Who Got Chewed Up By The Corrupt Political Machine, & It Broke Him.",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,2794,"['was', '22-yr', 'old', 'young', 'man', 'going', '23', 'when', 'millions', 'country', 'witnessed', 'R.', 'Budd', 'Dwyer', 'dramatic', 'riveting', 'final', 'speechat', 'televised', 'press', 'conference', 'had', 'called', 'time', 'lot', 'dirtypoliticians', 'were', 'being', 'caught', 'hands', 'cookie', 'jar', 'levelof', 'government', 'people', 'were', 'very', 'jaded', 'then.So', 'when', 'man', 'committed', 'suicide', 'end', 'speech', 'quite', 'gruesomely', 'may', 'add', 'many', 'thought', 'was', 'justanother', 'grimy', 'politician', 'who', 'got', 'caught', 'rather', 'face', 'hiscomeuppance', 'decided', 'exit', 'grand', 'shocking', 'style', 'month', 'so', 'later', 'world', 'had', 'moved', 'other', 'news', 'events.But', 'was', 'internet.As', 'years', 'went', 'would', 'now', 'then', 'reason', 'think', 'politician', 'who', 'killed', 'national', 'television.I', 'began', 'research', 'case', 'internet', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'uncensoredversion', 'Dwyer', 'final', 'press', 'conference', 'suicide', 'few', 'more', 'times', ""'d"", 'like', 'admit.Just', 'strange', 'morbid', 'human', 'curiosity', 'guess', 'never', 'felt', 'were', 'fodderfor', 'snarky', 'humor', 'many', 'later', 'generations', 'would.I', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'tragic.That', 'funny', 'thing', 'truth', 'kind', 'just', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'inclined', 'seek', 'what', 'made', 'immediately', 'interested', 'purchasing', 'video', 'on-demand', 'versionof', 'documentary', 'kindle', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'it.I', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'film', 'interviews', 'Dwyer', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'never', 'waivered', 'position', 'man', 'was', 'nothing', 'less', 'honorableand', 'totally', 'innocent', 'charges', 'were', 'brought', 'political', 'enemies.Instead', 'seeing', 'death', 'way', 'did', 'young', 'man', 'documentary', 'changed', 'wholeperception', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'tragedy', 'me.I', 'felt', 'bad', 'taking', 'thinking', 'herd', 'so', 'often', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'dumb.Dwyer', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'coward', 'way', '.He', 'was', 'honest', 'man', 'good', 'family', 'man', 'rare', 'true', 'blue', 'politician', 'by-gone', 'era', 'who', 'actually', 'wanted', 'help', 'fellowman', 'had', 'served', 'educator', 'youth', 'andreally', 'was', 'innovator', 'office', 'had', 'served', 'death.He', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'broken', 'severely', 'depressed', 'had', 'been', 'raked', 'coals.To', 'save', 'pensions', 'had', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'ensure', 'family', 'financialsecurity', 'head', 'shine', 'light', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'R', 'Budd', 'Dwyer', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'better', 'worse.Again', 'documentary', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'opened', 'mind', 'changedmy', 'whole', 'opinion', 'perception', 'haunting', 'events', 'lead', 'what', 'happenedon', 'national', 'TV', '26', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'saying', '.I', 'KNOW']",Honest Man: The Life of R.Budd Dwyer

1505872,A1AHYCO2YWXXG5,B005ZJ4UPW,"Privacy, Please","[5, 5]","I had already seen the footage of Dwyer's suicide many times on the Internet, as well as hearing about it the day it happened from relatives who lived in Western PA and called my husband up at work to tell him what they'd just seen on live TV.  I thought it was just another sad case of a politician who'd been caught with his hand in the cookie jar and couldn't deal with the shameful aftermath.  What a shock to find out that there is a very, very strong case that he was wrongly convicted and innocent all along.  That just makes the whole thing more poignant, as does the fact that his killing himself was the only way he could preserve some financial security for his wife and two children.Initially I thought this documentary would be biased in Dwyer's favor because his family was involved, but it gained, not lost, credibility the longer it went on.  Dwyer was, unfortunately, a country bumpkin who believed in honesty, truth, justice and America.  Unfortunately when those people run up against the realities of the political and justice system they often get eaten alive, as this man did.  It's pathetic that Dick Thornburgh, whose misuse of state funds appears to have been the driving force behind Dwyer's prosecution (or should I say persecution?), went on to high office.  I don't know how he sleeps at night but that's the kind of guy who sadly gets ahead in politics, while the honest men get trampled underfoot more often than not.
