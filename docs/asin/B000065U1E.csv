The movie is nothing of the sort.  It has funny moments, but basicly it is a heartfelt story of growing up and what it means to grow up, of forming caring relationships with friends, lovers and relatives.  The mechanism used is to force a privileged person to experience what it is like to live as the ""other half"" lives.  The pacing is perfect, there is not a false step anywhere, and there could have been so many.  And it is supported by some of the best music of Georges Delerue.  See if with your kids if you have any, but see it for yourself.  It will make your day, or your week.If you want to see this movie for the acting or because you're a fan of this person or that, fine.  I didn't know any of these actors, nor did I care.  The play's the thing, and this one is great.  And by the way, the picture quality on my DVD was fine.Another footnote: There's nothing wrong with slapstick per se.  There's good slapstick and bad, but there isn't any slapstick in this movie.  If that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.  Don't attack this movie because it isn't a different type of movie.

Ally plays a spoiled rich brat named Jesse.She could careless about her life and those around her. She spends her father's money without care. Her dad doesn't control her because he just wants to make up for her mother's death.Tom Skerritt(Alien, Contact) plays dad to Ally Sheedy, and he starts to learn that his daughter has no conscience.He becomes so fed up with her disrespectful behavior that he wishes that he never had a daughter. His wish is granted by a fairy godmother named Stella played by the one and only Beverly D'Angelo (National Lampoon's Vacation).Jesse doesn't take the situation seriously but learns quick when her father doesn't recognize or acknowledge her. Jesse is forced to take care of herself.

Jesse asks how and Stella bluntly tells her to get a job.What does a kid that has never had to work a day in her life do with herself? She becomes a maid.

But that is not necessary in order to enjoy this picture. It has all the essential ingredients for a good movie: a well-developed storyline, well established characters, scenes that will make you laugh and cry, and very capable acting to boot. Maid to Order actually has much in common with Arthur 2: On the Rocks. (see my review) Fans of that movie certainly should enjoy this one as well. Maid to Order, like Arthur 2, is essentially about a character, played in this case by Ally Sheedy, who goes from riches to rags to riches. Jessie (Ally) is just a young woman with too much of her father's money to spend and too much time to do it with. She simply needs to grow up. A fairy godmother (Beverly D'Angelo) grants her father's (Tom Skerritt) wish when he regrets even having a daughter. She's left homeless and without a past. She is forced to take a job as a maid, working for a flamboyant couple (Dick Shawn and Valerie Perrine) whom her father knows. The going is rough in the beginning, but she soon learns how to become friends with the rest of the hired help. This movie essentially belongs to Ally Sheedy (rarely is she not in a scene), but the supporting cast all have their shining moments as well. One of the classical lines comes from Stan (Dick Shawn) who tells Georgette (Valerie Perrine), ""I don't deserve to touch your toenails. Although it was the highlight of my breakfast.""

Besides, when you throw supporting performances by Tom Skerritt and Merry Clayton into this film, you can forgive a lot of the shortcoming of &quot;Maid to Order.&quot;D'Angelo's fairy godmother is named Stella (interesting, since D'Angelo got rave reviews for a television production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in which she played Stella Kowalski), who shows up to deal with spoiled little rich girl Jessie Montgomery (Ally Sheedy) who needs to learn a lesson.  This means going the riches to rags route by coming home from a party one morning and discovering that nobody remembers her, including her father (Skerritt).  It looks like Jessie is going to have to try to make it on her own and the future does not look bright.Jessie eventually manages to get a job as a maid (saw that one coming, did you?) for rock 'n' roll promoter Stan Starkey (Dick Shawn) and his airhead wife Georgette (Valerie Perrine), who are attempting to redefine new money vulgarity.  Slowly but surely Jessie learns to do her job and starts to connect with the downstairs staff, who take pity on her even though there is very little to like initially.  This includes the cook, Audrey James (Clayton), the maid Maria (Begona Plaza), and the handsome chauffer, Nick McGuire (Michael Ontkean), who become the closest thing Jessie has to family and friends in the brand new world in which she has to live.&quot;Maid to Order&quot; is fairly predictable and while we never really believe that Jessie was evil rather than stupid, there are a couple of heartfelt moments when she realizes that whatever she was it was wrong to be that way.  The strength of the film remains the relationships she forms with the rest of the staff, which matters in the big magical moment when she has the opportunity to wish for anything in the world and she actually thinks of her friends instead of herself.  This 1987 film might be predictable, but at least &quot;Maid to Order&quot; never gets stupid, which means this sweet little comedy comes from Amy Holden Jones out ahead in the end.",4,A fairy godmother helps a spoiled little rich girl grow up,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,2501,"['movie', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'fairy', 'godmother', 'going', 'be', 'kind', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'fan', ""D'Angelo"", 'ever', 'played', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'including', 'doing', 'own', 'singing', 'quot', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'quot', 'when', 'saw', 'quot', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Vacation', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'discover', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'did', 'not', 'involve', 'nudity', 'scene', 'Christie', 'Brinkley', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Besides', 'when', 'throw', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'Merry', 'Clayton', 'film', 'can', 'forgive', 'lot', 'shortcoming', 'quot', 'Maid', 'Order.', 'quot', ""D'Angelo"", 'fairy', 'godmother', 'named', 'Stella', 'interesting', ""D'Angelo"", 'got', 'rave', 'reviews', 'television', 'production', 'quot', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'quot', 'played', 'Stella', 'Kowalski', 'who', 'up', 'deal', 'spoiled', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'Jessie', 'Montgomery', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'who', 'learn', 'lesson', 'going', 'riches', 'rags', 'route', 'coming', 'home', 'party', 'one', 'morning', 'discovering', 'nobody', 'including', 'father', 'Skerritt', 'Jessie', 'going', 'have', 'try', 'make', 'own', 'future', 'not', 'look', 'bright.Jessie', 'eventually', 'get', 'job', 'maid', 'saw', 'one', 'coming', 'did', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'promoter', 'Stan', 'Starkey', 'Dick', 'Shawn', 'airhead', 'wife', 'Georgette', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'who', 'are', 'attempting', 'redefine', 'new', 'money', 'vulgarity', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'Jessie', 'do', 'job', 'connect', 'downstairs', 'staff', 'who', 'take', 'pity', 'even', 'very', 'little', 'like', 'initially', 'cook', 'Audrey', 'James', 'Clayton', 'maid', 'Maria', 'Begona', 'Plaza', 'handsome', 'chauffer', 'Nick', 'McGuire', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'who', 'become', 'closest', 'thing', 'Jessie', 'family', 'friends', 'brand', 'new', 'world', 'live.', 'quot', 'Maid', 'Order', 'quot', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'never', 'really', 'believe', 'Jessie', 'was', 'evil', 'rather', 'stupid', 'are', 'couple', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'when', 'was', 'was', 'wrong', 'be', 'way', 'strength', 'film', 'relationships', 'rest', 'staff', 'big', 'magical', 'moment', 'when', 'opportunity', 'wish', 'anything', 'world', 'actually', 'friends', 'instead', '1987', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'predictable', 'least', 'quot', 'Maid', 'Order', 'quot', 'never', 'stupid', 'sweet', 'little', 'comedy', 'Amy', 'Holden', 'Jones', 'out', 'ahead', 'end']",N/A
699933,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000065U1E,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[9, 10]","""Maid to Order"" is a rarity in Hollywood; a low-budget film based on a classic story that ends up being funny, clever and heart-warming.  Admittedly there are moments when Ally Sheedy's poor little rich girl act is a bit over-the-top, but when she is being other than a stereotype she is believable and sympathetic.Jessie Montgomery (Sheedy) is the daughter of a wealthy Charles Montgomery (Tom Skerritt).  Tom's role in this movie is relatively small, and nearly unimportant as he mainly tries (and fails) to figure out how to deal with his relatively uncontrollable daughter and is later studiously aloof when fairy godmother Stella Winston (Beverly D'Angelo) changes things as though Jessie had never been born.  Tom is important from the plot of the movie, however, as Stella was actually sent to help Charles Montgomery, at least, so Stella says.Jessie comes home one morning after a late night party to discover that her father and the household staff do not know her.  Jessie escapes the house, looking ever more bedraggled.  She tries to buy candy from a machine, only to have her money taken.  Finally, she decides to look for (gasp!) a job.  She happens to walk into an employment agency just as a status-seeking couple Stan and Georgette Starkey (Dick Shawn and Valerie Perrine) are seeking a white maid (who would have guessed that one?).Things have hit a low for Jessie as the Starkeys and their own spoiled daughter Brie Starkey (Rainbow Phoenix) turn out to be a pain for the hired help, micromanaging, money-grubbing, and more about image than substance.  The obvious irony being that Jessie now gets to see what life is like on the working class side of the fence, albeit a stereotypical view.However, the importance of Jessie's new position is how she sees the cook, the other maid and the chauffeur.  As a spoiled rich girl she barely recognized that anyone other than her social peers were even human, and now she gets to see that each person has their own history, their own problems, their own hopes and their own dreams, and theirs are far more substantial than whether they will have to miss out on the debutante party of the year.  Even more amazing, regardless of how much of a jerk Jessie initially is, these people actually give her more of a chance than she would have given them; this movie abounds with irony.As is typically the case in movies, it is always darkest before the dawn, and people who truly deserve chances get them, and those who need a kick in the pants get their just deserts, or at least a flavor of them.  The true magic of the film, beyond that of Stella Winston, is how Jessie evolves to learn how to think of others, which I leave to the viewer to discover for themselves.There is a lot of predictability in this movie, and you could probably have guessed some of the ending, but I was unable to guess more than generalities, and that is a good thing.  Further, the movie was sweet enough and funny enough to be worth buying and watching over again.  Some of the charm may be from the supporting roles.  Beverly D'Angelo is funny and clever as the fairy godmother.  Merry Clayton does an excellent job as Audrey James, once a famous singer and now the cook.  The other numerous roles give this movie a depth and character that I was not expecting from this relatively unknown comedy.This movie's humor is from the irony of Jessie's situation, and most of the comedy works.  The humor is often subtle, and some may not see the humor, but for everyone else, this movie is a keeper.",4,Well-Done Retelling of a Classic Tale,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,3531,"['Maid', 'Order', 'rarity', 'Hollywood', 'low-budget', 'film', 'based', 'classic', 'story', 'up', 'being', 'funny', 'clever', 'heart-warming', 'Admittedly', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'poor', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'act', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'when', 'being', 'other', 'stereotype', 'believable', 'sympathetic.Jessie', 'Montgomery', 'Sheedy', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'Charles', 'Montgomery', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'Tom', 'role', 'movie', 'relatively', 'small', 'nearly', 'unimportant', 'mainly', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'deal', 'relatively', 'uncontrollable', 'daughter', 'later', 'studiously', 'aloof', 'when', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Stella', 'Winston', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'things', 'Jessie', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'Tom', 'important', 'plot', 'movie', 'however', 'Stella', 'was', 'actually', 'sent', 'help', 'Charles', 'Montgomery', 'least', 'so', 'Stella', 'says.Jessie', 'home', 'one', 'morning', 'late', 'night', 'party', 'discover', 'father', 'household', 'staff', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Jessie', 'house', 'looking', 'ever', 'more', 'bedraggled', 'buy', 'candy', 'machine', 'only', 'have', 'money', 'taken', 'Finally', 'look', 'gasp', 'job', 'walk', 'employment', 'agency', 'just', 'status-seeking', 'couple', 'Stan', 'Georgette', 'Starkey', 'Dick', 'Shawn', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'are', 'seeking', 'white', 'maid', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'one', '.Things', 'have', 'hit', 'low', 'Jessie', 'Starkeys', 'own', 'spoiled', 'daughter', 'Brie', 'Starkey', 'Rainbow', 'Phoenix', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'pain', 'hired', 'help', 'micromanaging', 'money-grubbing', 'more', 'image', 'substance', 'obvious', 'irony', 'being', 'Jessie', 'now', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'working', 'class', 'side', 'fence', 'stereotypical', 'view.However', 'importance', 'Jessie', 'new', 'position', 'how', 'cook', 'other', 'maid', 'chauffeur', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'girl', 'barely', 'recognized', 'anyone', 'other', 'social', 'peers', 'were', 'even', 'human', 'now', 'see', 'person', 'own', 'history', 'own', 'problems', 'own', 'hopes', 'own', 'dreams', 'theirs', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'substantial', 'will', 'have', 'miss', 'out', 'debutante', 'party', 'year', 'Even', 'more', 'amazing', 'regardless', 'how', 'much', 'jerk', 'Jessie', 'initially', 'people', 'actually', 'give', 'more', 'chance', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'irony.As', 'typically', 'case', 'movies', 'always', 'darkest', 'dawn', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'deserve', 'chances', 'get', 'who', 'need', 'kick', 'pants', 'get', 'just', 'deserts', 'least', 'flavor', 'true', 'magic', 'film', 'Stella', 'Winston', 'how', 'Jessie', 'learn', 'how', 'think', 'others', 'leave', 'viewer', 'discover', 'lot', 'predictability', 'movie', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'guessed', 'ending', 'was', 'unable', 'guess', 'more', 'generalities', 'good', 'thing', 'Further', 'movie', 'was', 'sweet', 'enough', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'worth', 'buying', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'charm', 'may', 'be', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'funny', 'clever', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Merry', 'Clayton', 'excellent', 'job', 'Audrey', 'James', 'once', 'famous', 'singer', 'now', 'cook', 'other', 'numerous', 'roles', 'give', 'movie', 'depth', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'comedy.This', 'movie', 'humor', 'irony', 'Jessie', 'situation', 'most', 'comedy', 'humor', 'often', 'subtle', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'humor', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'keeper']",N/A

699939,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B000065U1E,Scott FS,"[1, 1]","The plot is simple (if whimsical): a fairy godmother intervenes with a well-to-do dad (Tom Skerritt) wishes away his spoiled, ungrateful daughter, Jessie Montgomery (Ally Sheedy).  Jessie is transformed from a rich daughter to a poor young lady, with no way to support herself.She does find employment at the slightly-off-center Starkey household (a play off of Richard Starkey's name?).  The snotty young lady undergoes humiliation after humiliation (the exploding vacuum cleaner is a classic) before changing to an unselfish woman who can appreciate the hired help, and the contribution they make to her (and others) lives.  She only keeps her job because she's white, and she's hired because of 'reverse affirmative action'!The plot is pretty predictable, but there are many sly observations on Hollywood, the music business, and the conceit (and deceit) that goes on behind the scenes (in a humorous way, of course).The acting is competent.  Sheedy, of course, is on-screen the most, and she does a good job as both the snooty rich girl, and the servant girl who slowly learns some of the real things about life 'downstairs'.I certainly appreciated the acting of Dick Shawn (Stan Starkey) and Valerie Perrine (Georgette Starkey).  They are a well-meaning couple who have made it big in the music business, and to their credit want to give something back to the 'unfortunates' of the world.  (""There are children starving in China!"")  This brings Jessie back in contact with her erstwhile dad, when he visits to pitch the 'Starlight Foundation' to the Starkeys.  Since Jessie has been 'written out' of her old life, her father doesn't recognize her.Eventually, after Jessie discovers that the 'hired help' are as valuable as those with money, and may even have hidden (or forgotten) talents.  All ends well, with a chastened Jessie back with her father, her wealthy lifestyle intact.
