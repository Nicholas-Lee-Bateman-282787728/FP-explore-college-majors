758531,A2B7MGTSS3O1JA,B00009W0VH,Beanhauer,"[23, 27]","This is an OK yoga video, but I'm bewildered by the glowing reviews. First, the music is unbelievably annoying. It's repetitive, synthesized, license-free music bin material. Second, the terminology misuse is a problem. I read another review that complained about the use of ""plow"" for ""lunge"" pose, and thought it was something I could live with. No. The pose, and it's wrong name, are repeated so often it does become annoying. And my mind does jump to how I'm going to get into ""plow"" from ""down dog"" without breaking my neck before I remember she really means lunge. Third, the instructor is fine, but if she wasn't beautiful someone else would be on the DVD. She seems like a young yoga instructor who is much beloved in some smaller city, not like a real expert. Fourth, I didn't feel like I had done much when I was done with the series. Finally, I really like the actual names for the poses and all. ""Morning Quickie"" for a series of sun salutations is cloyingly cute to me. If it's 30 minutes of sun salutations, just say so.This video may pop into my rotation every few months, but I don't feel like I'm going to learn anything new from it, or grow my practice through it. For that matter, I'm not sure I'm ever going to decide the benefits of the workout outweigh the annoyance of the music.",3,OK...but terrific?!,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,1302,"['OK', 'yoga', 'video', ""'m"", 'bewildered', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'First', 'music', 'unbelievably', 'annoying', 'repetitive', 'synthesized', 'license-free', 'music', 'bin', 'material', 'Second', 'terminology', 'misuse', 'problem', 'read', 'review', 'complained', 'use', 'plow', 'lunge', 'pose', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'could', 'live', 'No', 'pose', 'wrong', 'name', 'are', 'repeated', 'so', 'often', 'become', 'annoying', 'mind', 'jump', 'how', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'plow', 'down', 'dog', 'breaking', 'neck', 'remember', 'really', 'lunge', 'Third', 'instructor', 'fine', 'was', ""n't"", 'beautiful', 'someone', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'DVD', 'young', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'who', 'much', 'beloved', 'smaller', 'city', 'not', 'real', 'expert', 'Fourth', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'had', 'done', 'much', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'series', 'Finally', 'really', 'actual', 'names', 'poses', 'Morning', 'Quickie', 'series', 'sun', 'salutations', 'cloyingly', 'cute', '30', 'minutes', 'sun', 'salutations', 'just', 'say', 'so.This', 'video', 'may', 'pop', 'rotation', 'few', 'months', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'m"", 'going', 'learn', 'anything', 'new', 'grow', 'practice', 'matter', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'m"", 'ever', 'going', 'decide', 'benefits', 'workout', 'outweigh', 'annoyance', 'music']",Hemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Living
758532,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00009W0VH,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[35, 35]","Hemalaya Behl's Yoga for Urban Living series provides three separate yoga practices which are designed to be used throughout the day. Some fairly challenging poses are included, and so the routines are probably best suited to intermediate-level yogis, although experienced beginners may be able to modify enough to follow along and more advanced practitioners are likely to enjoy the variety of the routines. The individual practices are as follows:1) Morning Bath--This 35-minute section was my favorite of the three. Hemalaya begins by leading you through some gentle stretches designed to wake up the body in the A.M. via increasing the blood flow to various parts of the body. An energizing breathing exercise is also included to enhance energy during the practice, which consists of a variety of sun salutation series. Each series becomes increasingly strenuous, gradually adding in some challenging poses such as revolved prayer twist. The practice ends with a nice relaxation and brief &quot;Om&quot; chanting.2) Daily Connection--This 56-minute routine is designed as a complete daily yoga practice. Hemalaya again incorporates chants and energized breathing into the warmup as a means to awaken both the body and the mind. The practice itself is a nice blend of sun salutations, standing postures, balance work, and floor poses. Many poses are more challenging and demand an intermediate level of expertise, including eagle pose, pigeon, and some lying inversions. Unfortunately, the relaxation segment at the end of the practice is extremely brief, so most people will want to extend the routine a bit to allow for a longer period in savasana.3) Evening Bath--This was my least favorite of the three sections, mainly because I had little previous experience with some of the more advanced postures included (eg, shoulderstand, plow, deaf man's pose). The 25-minute routine is designed to be a relaxing, end-of-day practice, and as a result, Hemalaya moves much more slowly than in the first two practices. For those who want to move more deeply into challenging relaxation postures, this program might be ideal.Overall, I enjoyed this series and found Hemalaya's instruction to be both skilled and unique. Despite her Eastern training, she comes across as very down-to-earth, and she practices in a soothing loft-type living room setting with unobtrusive tribal-type music in the background. However, I should also note that she does not consistently provide mirrored cueing, and at times her voiceover is a bit out-of-sync with her movements on screen.This DVD set would be perfect for someone looking to expand their home yoga practice with several new routines of varying lengths, all of which can be performed at any time of day.",4,Nice variety of practices for intermediate level yogis,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,2743,"['Hemalaya', 'Behl', 'Yoga', 'Urban', 'Living', 'series', 'three', 'separate', 'yoga', 'practices', 'are', 'designed', 'be', 'used', 'day', 'fairly', 'challenging', 'poses', 'are', 'included', 'so', 'routines', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'suited', 'intermediate-level', 'yogis', 'experienced', 'beginners', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'modify', 'enough', 'follow', 'along', 'more', 'advanced', 'practitioners', 'are', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'variety', 'routines', 'individual', 'practices', 'are', 'follows:1', 'Morning', 'Bath', '35-minute', 'section', 'was', 'favorite', 'three', 'Hemalaya', 'leading', 'gentle', 'stretches', 'designed', 'wake', 'up', 'body', 'A.M.', 'increasing', 'blood', 'flow', 'various', 'parts', 'body', 'energizing', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'also', 'included', 'enhance', 'energy', 'practice', 'variety', 'sun', 'salutation', 'series', 'series', 'increasingly', 'strenuous', 'gradually', 'adding', 'challenging', 'poses', 'such', 'revolved', 'prayer', 'twist', 'practice', 'nice', 'relaxation', 'brief', 'quot', 'Om', 'quot', 'chanting.2', 'Daily', 'Connection', '56-minute', 'routine', 'designed', 'complete', 'daily', 'yoga', 'practice', 'Hemalaya', 'again', 'chants', 'energized', 'breathing', 'warmup', 'means', 'awaken', 'body', 'mind', 'practice', 'nice', 'blend', 'sun', 'salutations', 'standing', 'postures', 'balance', 'work', 'floor', 'poses', 'Many', 'poses', 'are', 'more', 'challenging', 'demand', 'intermediate', 'level', 'expertise', 'including', 'eagle', 'pose', 'pigeon', 'lying', 'inversions', 'Unfortunately', 'relaxation', 'segment', 'end', 'practice', 'extremely', 'brief', 'so', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'want', 'extend', 'routine', 'bit', 'allow', 'longer', 'period', 'savasana.3', 'Evening', 'Bath', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'three', 'sections', 'mainly', 'had', 'little', 'previous', 'experience', 'more', 'advanced', 'postures', 'included', 'eg', 'shoulderstand', 'plow', 'deaf', 'man', 'pose', '25-minute', 'routine', 'designed', 'be', 'relaxing', 'end-of-day', 'practice', 'result', 'Hemalaya', 'much', 'more', 'slowly', 'first', 'two', 'practices', 'who', 'want', 'move', 'more', 'deeply', 'challenging', 'relaxation', 'postures', 'program', 'might', 'be', 'ideal.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'found', 'Hemalaya', 'instruction', 'be', 'skilled', 'unique', 'Eastern', 'training', 'very', 'down-to-earth', 'practices', 'soothing', 'loft-type', 'living', 'room', 'setting', 'unobtrusive', 'tribal-type', 'music', 'background', 'However', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'not', 'consistently', 'provide', 'mirrored', 'cueing', 'times', 'voiceover', 'bit', 'out-of-sync', 'movements', 'screen.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'someone', 'looking', 'expand', 'home', 'yoga', 'practice', 'several', 'new', 'routines', 'varying', 'lengths', 'can', 'be', 'performed', 'time', 'day']",Hemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Living
758533,A322M6IFZEEVZO,B00009W0VH,black kat,"[4, 5]","I really enjoy this DVD and use it often. I like the choice of poses and workout lengths it affords. Hemalaya flows, but moves slowly, and holds each pose long enough that you can sink into it, something I really like to do.I am quite flexible and would classify myself as an advanced beginner. I find that this disc is pretty much at the exact pitch I'm looking for. If you're a beginning beginner, it might not suit so well. Behl doesn't stop to explain things - she demonstrates and moves on. She performs the workouts alone, suggests no modifications and uses no props. However, because the pace is so stately, I think it should be possible to follow along comfortably, once you have some basic grounding.The 60 minute Daily Connection is a well-rounded workout which always leaves me feeling nicely stretched and ready for anything. I often do the two other workouts in one day, the enlivening Morning Quickie (30 mins) first thing and the Evening Bath at bedtime.I'm puzzled by a previous reviewer's contention that there's no spirituality in this yoga. I find the opposite to be true. Hemalaya opens the sessions with chanting, and includes pranayama - kapalabhati and a kundalini energizing breath. Overall, I found the atmosphere quite traditional and Eastern - in no way is this Westernised or gym-style yoga.I have to agree with another previous reviewer, however, in disliking the music. It particularly bothers me on the main practice. But it's easily enough remedied, since there's a voice-only instruction option. As others have observed also, the shavasana is extremely short. A CD player and some music of your own choice comes in handy, if you like practising and relaxing to music.European readers might be interested to know that although Amazon have categorised this as a region 1 DVD, it plays perfectly in my DVD player which isn't  a multi-region model and hasn't been adjusted or hacked in any way. In fact it's just a little cheapie compact player, about two years old. Nowhere on the disc itself or its cover is Region 1 stated. I think this might be a default categorisation by Amazon of US yoga DVDs. I've bought many others here (Gaiam and Yoga Zone, to name a few) which were also supposedly Region 1 but happily they all played without a blip.",5,Lovely strong slow flows,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,2275,"['really', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'use', 'often', 'choice', 'poses', 'workout', 'lengths', 'Hemalaya', 'slowly', 'pose', 'long', 'enough', 'can', 'sink', 'something', 'really', 'do.I', 'am', 'quite', 'flexible', 'would', 'classify', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'find', 'disc', 'pretty', 'much', 'exact', 'pitch', ""'m"", 'looking', ""'re"", 'beginning', 'beginner', 'might', 'not', 'suit', 'so', 'well', 'Behl', ""n't"", 'stop', 'explain', 'things', 'moves', 'workouts', 'alone', 'modifications', 'props', 'However', 'pace', 'so', 'stately', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'possible', 'follow', 'along', 'comfortably', 'once', 'have', 'basic', 'grounding.The', '60', 'minute', 'Daily', 'Connection', 'well-rounded', 'workout', 'always', 'feeling', 'nicely', 'stretched', 'ready', 'anything', 'often', 'do', 'two', 'other', 'workouts', 'one', 'day', 'enlivening', 'Morning', 'Quickie', '30', 'mins', 'first', 'thing', 'Evening', 'Bath', 'bedtime.I', ""'m"", 'puzzled', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'contention', 'spirituality', 'yoga', 'find', 'opposite', 'be', 'true', 'Hemalaya', 'sessions', 'chanting', 'pranayama', 'kapalabhati', 'kundalini', 'energizing', 'breath', 'Overall', 'found', 'atmosphere', 'quite', 'traditional', 'Eastern', 'way', 'Westernised', 'gym-style', 'yoga.I', 'have', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'however', 'disliking', 'music', 'particularly', 'bothers', 'main', 'practice', 'easily', 'enough', 'remedied', 'voice-only', 'instruction', 'option', 'others', 'have', 'observed', 'also', 'shavasana', 'extremely', 'short', 'CD', 'player', 'music', 'own', 'choice', 'handy', 'like', 'practising', 'relaxing', 'music.European', 'readers', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'Amazon', 'have', 'categorised', 'region', '1', 'DVD', 'perfectly', 'DVD', 'player', ""n't"", 'multi-region', 'model', ""n't"", 'been', 'adjusted', 'hacked', 'way', 'fact', 'just', 'little', 'cheapie', 'compact', 'player', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'Nowhere', 'disc', 'cover', 'Region', '1', 'stated', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'default', 'categorisation', 'Amazon', 'US', 'yoga', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'Gaiam', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'name', 'few', 'were', 'also', 'supposedly', 'Region', '1', 'happily', 'played', 'blip']",Hemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Living

She holds the poses for a nice amount of time with relaxation betweeen. Thanks Hemalaya! I'm waiting for a follow-up to this one. Well worth the money!!!It is broken into 3 different sessions. The AM and PM sessions are 30 min. The AM is energizing and PM is relaxing. Both include a wide variety of yoga poses. She explains well, holds the poses for a long time, and allows time between to listen to the echos of the pose. My favorite is the full 1 hour session.

758535,A118DD1BQQX1WX,B00009W0VH,James E. White,"[154, 155]","I really enjoyed this DVD.  This is the first DVD I have purchased from Behl, and let me say that she certainly knows her craft.  This DVD offers a workout for every point in the day, a morning quickie (30 minutes), a full workout 60 minutes, a evening workout (25 minutes), breathing exercises, etc.  She gives you an opportuntity to experience almost every aspect of yoga (meditation, breath work, postures, etc.).  I think that this is one of the most complete yoga dvds on the market today.  A person can really get an at home practice going with this dvd.  The only thing I would tell someone wanting to purchase this dvd is that this not a Power Yoga type of dvd, where you will sweat the whole workout.  Although some of the poses are challenging and all of them are held for a fair amount of time, these workouts are not designed to make a person sweat to the degree that say an Ashtanga workout, a vinyasa flow, or Bikram workout are intended to.  After completing one or more of these workouts you will feel stretched, relaxed, and calm, but do not expect a heavy sweat (ala Rodney Yee's Power Yoga, Berly Birch's Power Yoga, or Richard Freeman's Primary Series dvds).  I recommend this dvd for a person with at least a few months experience with yoga, especially before attempting the 60 minutes segment if you are not used to an hour or so of yoga.  However, the new yoga enthusiast can still get something out of the morning quickie workout and the evening bath workout, and work their way up to the 60 minute workout.  Again, this is a great dvd, and is a great buy for the person who is looking for a yoga workout that gives a person more than just a good physical workout.",5,Great traditional yoga workout w/ lots of options,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,1688,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'first', 'DVD', 'have', 'purchased', 'Behl', 'let', 'say', 'certainly', 'craft', 'DVD', 'workout', 'point', 'day', 'morning', 'quickie', '30', 'minutes', 'full', 'workout', '60', 'minutes', 'evening', 'workout', '25', 'minutes', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'etc', 'opportuntity', 'experience', 'almost', 'aspect', 'yoga', 'meditation', 'breath', 'work', 'postures', 'etc.', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'complete', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'market', 'today', 'person', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'home', 'practice', 'going', 'dvd', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'tell', 'someone', 'wanting', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'not', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'type', 'dvd', 'where', 'will', 'sweat', 'whole', 'workout', 'poses', 'are', 'challenging', 'are', 'held', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'workouts', 'are', 'not', 'designed', 'make', 'person', 'sweat', 'degree', 'say', 'Ashtanga', 'workout', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'Bikram', 'workout', 'are', 'intended', 'completing', 'one', 'more', 'workouts', 'will', 'feel', 'stretched', 'relaxed', 'calm', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'heavy', 'sweat', 'ala', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Berly', 'Birch', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Richard', 'Freeman', 'Primary', 'Series', 'dvds', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'person', 'least', 'few', 'months', 'experience', 'yoga', 'especially', 'attempting', '60', 'minutes', 'segment', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'hour', 'so', 'yoga', 'However', 'new', 'yoga', 'enthusiast', 'can', 'still', 'get', 'something', 'morning', 'quickie', 'workout', 'evening', 'bath', 'workout', 'work', 'way', '60', 'minute', 'workout', 'Again', 'great', 'dvd', 'great', 'buy', 'person', 'who', 'looking', 'yoga', 'workout', 'person', 'more', 'just', 'good', 'physical', 'workout']",Hemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Living

First of all the instructor is attractive and very well under dressed which is nice. I don't over dress to practice either. The quality of the video is very good.  There is a section about breathing which is about 5 minutes, main flow is 60 minutes, AM wake up is 36 minutes and the PM is 25 minutes with an additional instruction section which is about 5 minutes. The main practice has a nice slow pace with stretching between poses that helps the next pose to be fresh with no residue from the last pose. There is not enough instruction for a true beginner so this is for someone who is familiar with yoga. A few of her instructions do not coincide with her movements and when she calls for a plow and in fact she is doing a lunge confused me until I looked at the screen to see what she was doing. She also gets her left and right mixed up a few times. All in all I like this routine after I became familiar with the instructor.

The am workout has more sun salutes, would wake you up and is invigorating.  The evening practice is more slow and relaxing with stretching.  The middle workout is longer, about an hour with pigeon pose as the peak pose.  The music is upbeat - Bollywood-ish.  Hemalaya is nice to look at.  She is working out in an empty room to show how even in a small apartment you could do this whole workout.  As promised, this is very good for the urban dweller.So why didn't I give it a full 5? My main concerns are: 1) She instructs you into a shoulder stand and then tells you to stretch out your neck in a manner that is sort of scary to me.  I was taught at more than one studio to keep the head and neck straight in a shoulder stand.  I was told that moving it side to side like that might strain a muscle.  Ok, maybe I was told wrong - just thought I should mention this to potential buyers.2) The shoulder stand itself is something I don't think you should do if you have eye issues, neck issues or osteoporosis.  There's no modification given.  If you regularly practice shoulder stand this will not present a problem.  If you don't, or aren't sure if it's safe for you - learn how to do one from a live teacher before you try this trick at home.  There are many possible modifications a teacher can offer as a substitute.Other than that, I think this is a well sequenced workout.

758541,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00009W0VH,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[99, 104]","""Yoga for Urban living is designed to work around your schedule."" ~Hemalaya BehlHemalaya Behl has been studying yoga since an early age and her practice is steeped in authenticity. She has studied the teachings of Hatha, Vinyasa, Ayurvedic and Tantra.Hemalaya Behl's Yoga workouts allow you to create your very own yoga sanctuary. Her workouts embody the spirit of yoga. She has a very casual approach. In fact, she is talking you through the entire workout ""from a distance."" She doesn't actually speak while doing the exercises, but her calming voice/instruction drifts in and out of the soundtrack.If you are finely tuned and ready to move as soon as an instructor tells you what you will be doing next, relax into this calming series of exercises. There is no rush, no place to go, just breathe. I find her instruction style to be very calming and she has a beautiful spirit.There are three workouts:Morning Quickie - The blue walls speak of emotional stability and the wood floors and plants place an emphasis on natural materials. Perfect for any time of the day when you have 40 minutes to enjoy a this yoga escape. There are a few gentle neck stretches and then you start to breathe away your tension and stress. There is an interesting ""rotation"" segment and a ""sun salutation series"" in which she is rather good about telling you what you will do next. While doing the spine twists, I suddenly realized I was going much deeper into the poses than I had on other yoga workouts. You will recognize positions like triangle, plow, down dog and cobra. Hemalaya also includes a variety of authentic moves and creative poses.Daily Connection - The workout is set in a room where purple splashes across the walls in paint and artwork presents a peaceful still dimension. In 60 minutes, Hemalaya can bring you from the highest mountain of stress to the most tranquil valley of relaxation. Her pleasant voice leads you into a meditation of the body. The poses follow a logical progression and have a depth. It reminds me of how one drop of water meets the next and eventually there is a peaceful stream. This is the best way to describe what I cannot otherwise put into words. If you complete all the poses to the fullest extent, this could be considered an advanced workout. I could not fully complete the ""eagle"" or ""camel"" although I can say that when I was in my 20s, these were much easier for me to accomplish. While doing this workout, I did finally succeed in maintaining the most amazing Tree Pose I've ever done. It is definitely easier to do tree pose while wearing the shortest shorts. Having fabric in the way does not allow your foot to remain planted on your other leg. You just have to do this pose to see why I am saying this. Anyway, I was quite elated that I could finally master this pose. There are many poses in this workout I won't be mastering for at least another year!Evening Bath - When they say: Evening Bath - they mean it. You know how you feel when you have a nice warm bath before bed? Well, this yoga workout will have the exact same effect. I'm not sure if it is just the poses or the music that helps you relax into a deep level of peace. The truth is, I feel blissfully asleep while in the relaxation pose and now I know that I should probably climb into bed at that stage. This ""evening bath"" workout is definitely for the time right before bed. The exercises start with ""OM"" and as the word vibrates through your entire being, you will quickly abandon all worry and fear and sink into a state of serenity. There are a few gentle twists and then you start to breathe away your tension and stress. You will recognize most of the yoga poses. Spine stretch, leg stretches while on your back, spinal lift, relaxing rolls from side to side, youth postures (fountain of youth - I had no idea my body could do this pose), resting pose (definite challenge pose you can work into over time), chest-opening poses and full-body stretch. The pace is just slow enough to relax and just fast enough so you don't get bored.Yoga can be a place of escape from everyday stress. The tension of the day melts away into your yoga mat and drips invisibly through the floor as a deep sense of peace pervades your entire being. Yoga reminds you to breathe, to nurture the soul that you are, to let your body release the stress for you as you stretch away worry, fear, sorrow and anger. After completing this yoga workout, all you will feel is an incredible sense of peace and bliss. The postures all flow beautifully and each yoga workout has a different emphasis.Special DVD Features:Breathing Techniques SectionInstructional SegmentCustom Audio OptionsInteractive Full Motion MenusP.S. IDEA: I think you can enjoy this workout even more if you place a blanket or down comforter on the floor and then put your yoga mat on top of the blanket/comforter. Having another comforter for the relaxation stage adds an entire new dimension of luxurious comfort. Then, fold a towel in half and place it in the middle of your mat. This gives you more ""comfort"" during your workout. I find it is easy to move the towel, but I really enjoy the feeling of a soft towel under my feet instead of always feeling the cold ""plastic"" feel of the yoga mat. Doing all this might seem like too much extra effort, but when you do the Urban Living workouts, you are really creating a mood and a place for your soul to escape and your body to relax.~The Rebecca

758543,ABFONZIDLU1ED,B00009W0VH,Samantha,"[0, 0]","I have had this DVD since 2003 and still use at least once a week, though mainly just the afternoon connection, or 60 minute session.I absolutely love the sequencing  and flow of the yoga asanas featured. The hour long session I am most familiar with features a variety of postures. After stretching, standing postures include triangle, warrior, plow, tree and (for myself) the most challenging eagle pose etc. There is a sense of grace but challenge in this early part of the workout. Poses such as the plough and subsequent transitions into the downward dog are challenging when repeated as they are; therefore if you are looking to raise your heart rate a bit this DVD is suitable.Postures featured on the floor such as lying inversions may require continued attempts by the beginner yogi/ini or an alternate posture for someone such as myself who has inner ear problems (those with head, lung, neck issues as well as those menstruating also take note) Ms. Behl suggests often to rock on your back with your knees to your chest---this is alright but does not provide much of a challenge. The pigeon series towards the end of the hour long session is particularly beautiful and I have found as someone who keeps in shape with a variety of workouts that the stretching that occurs here is really valuable as a warm up for other exercises.The relaxation/meditation at the end of the program is decent but way to short. I often pause the DVD and continue with this portion until ready to finish the session alltogether.The morning session or 'morning quickie' is invigorating as promising and those who are familiar with the yoga sun salutations will grasp this quickly, though as another reviewer noted, the variations featured in each sun salutation cycle are quite deep and as someone who is ""balance challenged"" I sometimes fall out of these asanas which is fine--- a challenge is great!I don't do the 'evening bath' session too much but have found it rather relaxing.The overall content and environment of this workout is one of the main reasons I keep using it. As the title promises both Ms.Behl's teaching style and the cosmopolitan feel of the yoga studio are fairly urban and sans the 'fluff' that tends to cloud other yoga workouts e.g beach/outdoor locations and/or an gratuitious spirituality.For beginners and/or people not so familiar with breathing techniques there is a great tutorial section that I still refer back to and use even in other yoga workouts.

758544,A1R1EBKHAADRH2,B00009W0VH,SharkLady,"[13, 13]","This was certainly an enjoyable yoga DVD.  The main portion is a full 60-minutes, which seems adequate as Hemalaya hold the poses for quite a long time to really feel each stretch.  There are several more advanced poses, for which she does not necessarily show the modifications, but does explain them thoroughly enough that I was able to pick up on those poses for which I need them.  There are my more advanced poses then I'm used to on DVDs, but I must say I liked the challenge, and again was able to pickup on the modifications relatively easily.The morning quickie of about 30-minutes was a bit more of a ""power yoga"" type.  It goes through several sun salutations fairly quickly and you will manage to work up a bit of a sweat depending on your fitness level.  These are again fairly easy to follow though it may take a few peeks at the TV screen to become used to it.The evening bath of about 30-minutes was great as well.  Relaxing enough, though I personally do prefer ""Candlelight Yoga"", but this is definitely great for a change.I have a few minor complaints about the video, which is more personal preference, but it would be nice to be forewarned.  First of all, this DVD is narrated by Hemalaya, she does not speak when showing you the poses, but does voiceover instead.  This always throws me for a loop because I do prefer when the instructor speaks live time as it feels a bit more personal.  As a result of that, as many other reviewers have mentioned, her moves are often ahead of her narration and that can sometimes throw you a bit behind the visual if you're not studying the screen.  Finally, Hemalaya does not ""mirror"" you as most DVD workouts will.  I tried to stick to the verbal queues here instead, but did find myself accidentally starting on the same side again with the quicker transitions.Overall, a great yoga DVD, and I do recommend.  I'll definitely be looking at Hemalaya's other DVD when I'm ready to purchase a new one.",4,A good yoga workout overall....,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,1958,"['was', 'certainly', 'enjoyable', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'main', 'portion', 'full', '60-minutes', 'adequate', 'Hemalaya', 'hold', 'poses', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'really', 'feel', 'stretch', 'are', 'several', 'more', 'advanced', 'poses', 'not', 'necessarily', 'show', 'modifications', 'explain', 'thoroughly', 'was', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'poses', 'need', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'poses', 'then', ""'m"", 'used', 'DVDs', 'must', 'say', 'liked', 'challenge', 'again', 'was', 'able', 'pickup', 'modifications', 'relatively', 'easily.The', 'morning', 'quickie', '30-minutes', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'power', 'yoga', 'type', 'several', 'sun', 'salutations', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'will', 'manage', 'work', 'up', 'bit', 'sweat', 'depending', 'fitness', 'level', 'are', 'again', 'fairly', 'easy', 'follow', 'may', 'take', 'few', 'peeks', 'TV', 'screen', 'become', 'used', 'it.The', 'evening', 'bath', '30-minutes', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'Relaxing', 'enough', 'personally', 'do', 'prefer', 'Candlelight', 'Yoga', 'definitely', 'great', 'change.I', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'complaints', 'video', 'more', 'personal', 'preference', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'be', 'forewarned', 'First', 'all', 'DVD', 'narrated', 'Hemalaya', 'not', 'speak', 'when', 'showing', 'poses', 'voiceover', 'instead', 'always', 'loop', 'do', 'prefer', 'when', 'instructor', 'live', 'time', 'bit', 'more', 'personal', 'result', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'moves', 'are', 'often', 'ahead', 'narration', 'can', 'sometimes', 'throw', 'bit', 'visual', ""'re"", 'not', 'studying', 'screen', 'Finally', 'Hemalaya', 'not', 'mirror', 'most', 'DVD', 'workouts', 'will', 'tried', 'stick', 'verbal', 'queues', 'here', 'instead', 'did', 'find', 'accidentally', 'starting', 'same', 'side', 'again', 'quicker', 'transitions.Overall', 'great', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'do', 'recommend', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'looking', 'Hemalaya', 'other', 'DVD', 'when', ""'m"", 'ready', 'purchase', 'new', 'one']",Hemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Living

It consists mainly of sun salutations and breathing exercises, such as ""energized breathing"" and the quick and powerful exhales through the nose called Kapalabati.The 25-minute ""evening bath"" involves mostly twisting and inverted poses.The ""daily connection"" is a 60-minute routine that encompasses a wide variety of stretching, strengthening, balancing, and energizing poses.Behl also includes an instructional and breathing segment for those who are new to yoga.Overall, it's a great yoga video for those who prefer a well-rounded yoga practice.",4,Well-rounded,1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,732,"['always', 'plus', 'when', 'yoga', 'videos', 'offer', 'options', 'case', 'can', 'choose', '3', 'routines', '30-minute', 'morning', 'quickie', 'warming', 'energizing', 'body', 'mainly', 'sun', 'salutations', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'such', 'energized', 'breathing', 'quick', 'powerful', 'exhales', 'nose', 'called', 'Kapalabati.The', '25-minute', 'evening', 'bath', 'mostly', 'twisting', 'inverted', 'poses.The', 'daily', 'connection', '60-minute', 'routine', 'wide', 'variety', 'stretching', 'strengthening', 'balancing', 'energizing', 'poses.Behl', 'also', 'instructional', 'breathing', 'segment', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'yoga.Overall', 'great', 'yoga', 'video', 'who', 'prefer', 'well-rounded', 'yoga', 'practice']",Hemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Living

Gray ""honeyluna1221""","[11, 12]","The 60 minute main workout is very challenging, but I was really glad to see that her workouts include a shoulder stand and shoulder stretch. Although I couldn't do the advance versions of these poses, I know that I will be able to work up to them. This is not for beginners and a beginner could be someone that has done yoga for 2 years or less. Even the beginner dvd's are useful for the advanced yogini's so my recommendation is not too move to fast through your yoga journey. I really liked this DVD but it was a bit too advanced for me. I will use it as something to work up to. The morning quickie will be great a couple times a week and the pm workout twice a week. I do have other yoga workouts that I will use when I feel like I just can't do this one.",5,Challenging practice,1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,761,"['60', 'minute', 'main', 'workout', 'very', 'challenging', 'was', 'really', 'glad', 'see', 'workouts', 'include', 'shoulder', 'stand', 'shoulder', 'stretch', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'advance', 'versions', 'poses', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'work', 'up', 'not', 'beginners', 'beginner', 'could', 'be', 'someone', 'done', 'yoga', '2', 'years', 'less', 'Even', 'beginner', 'dvd', 'are', 'useful', 'advanced', 'yogini', 'recommendation', 'not', 'too', 'move', 'fast', 'yoga', 'journey', 'really', 'liked', 'DVD', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'advanced', 'will', 'use', 'something', 'work', 'up', 'morning', 'quickie', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'couple', 'week', 'pm', 'workout', 'twice', 'week', 'do', 'have', 'other', 'yoga', 'workouts', 'will', 'use', 'when', 'feel', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'one']",Hemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Living

For those of you who don't like sun salutations, the main 60 minutes routine doesn't have any, it's starts with some breathing and chanting OM ,stretches and cat pose and goes right to standing poses , with eagle pose first. The morning quicky is mainly sun salutations and some standing poses. There's also an evening bath routine which I haven't tried yet. You can also choose your audio:  music with insructions, or  each of them seperately.
