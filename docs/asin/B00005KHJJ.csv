Ed Harris stars and directs in this portrait of a famous painter who struggled with innovation and booze to create some of the most ground-breaking art between Picasso and Warhol.  The portrait is in the details.  Especially his artist wife, Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden) believed in him enough to put up with his sporadic abuse and alcohol.  His biological family believed in the basics and hardly embraced his profession or his genius.  But nothing seemed like enough for him, either.

662120,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,B00005KHJJ,AKN,"[0, 0]","This tells a rather simplistic story of a great painter with a serious drinking problem.  It helps if you are an admirer of Pollock's works when you watch this.Pollack was a good painter before the accidental discovery of his pouring technique but when he realized he could create masterpieces simply by pouting and splattering the paint he made his mark as the foremost abstract painter of the century.His rags to riches fame was assured and he was the superstar of his day.What I found disappointing was the lack of depiction of his early life, his childhood, and the roots of his obvious inner demons.  This picks up on his life in New York City as a struggling unknown artist, and shows the path his career took that led to his fame.  But what happened before that?His idyllic life in upstate New York, creating his artwork, drinking heavily,was shown but we are never given any glimpse into what may have contributed to his inner turmoil.  There are many scenes of him creating his poured paintings and these are copies of well known short films taken of the artist at work.  There isn't anything novel or new here.I gave this four stars because I found it enjoyable to watch.  But it lacked any depth or exploration of Pollock's early life.  To watch this, it seems that Pollock was simply a drunk who happened to be a good painter.  And maybe that's all he was.But somehow, his paintings indicate that there was more to the man than just drinking and painting well.

Was it self-interest that  motivated the ambitious Lee Krasner to stay with him ? Perhaps the need to nurture, and be a part of a talent greater than hers ? Who can tell what drives such complex relationships, and had she not been at his side, it is doubtful that he would have achieved his current place in art history; perhaps it was a fated, infernal partnership, all for art's sake.Ed Harris as director and actor brought this story to life with believability and his chemistry with Marcia Gay Harden is superb; he received Oscar nomination for Best Actor, and she won for Best Supporting Actress, and both deservedly so. There is a fight scene towards the end of the film that is so real it sounds as if it is actually happening. I find myself lowering the volume, so my neighbors don't call the police.Also excellent is Sada Thompson as Pollock's mother, and Amy Madigan (Mrs. Ed Harris in real life) as Peggy Guggenheim.The cinematography, set, and costume design all capture the look of mid 20th century America, and the soundtrack by Jeff Beal is lovely; I particularly like the sprightly theme that seems sometimes to connect one scene to another.I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the depiction of the creative process, like when he discovered his drip technique, and also loved the representation of the 1950 exhibit at the Betty Parsons Gallery, with the final camera shot zooming into the paint itself.Though he struggled long and hard for fame, once it was his, he said &quot;I feel like a clam without a shell&quot;. Lee survived him by by 28 years, and hopefully, found some peace and joy in life, along with the wonderful work she was to do once on her own.This is not something to view on a date night, or for fun, but it is a fascinating film, especially for someone in the arts.",5,the man who painted energy,1058572800,"07 19, 2003",2003,2013,"['Based', 'quot', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'American', 'Saga', 'quot', 'Steven', 'Naifeh', 'Gregory', 'White', 'Smith', 'film', 'portrait', 'destructive', 'self', 'indulgent', 'man', 'who', 'brilliant', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'double-distilled', 'jerk', 'Was', 'self-interest', 'motivated', 'ambitious', 'Lee', 'Krasner', 'stay', 'Perhaps', 'need', 'nurture', 'be', 'part', 'talent', 'greater', 'hers', 'Who', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'such', 'complex', 'relationships', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'side', 'doubtful', 'would', 'have', 'achieved', 'current', 'place', 'art', 'history', 'perhaps', 'was', 'fated', 'infernal', 'partnership', 'art', 'sake.Ed', 'Harris', 'director', 'actor', 'brought', 'story', 'life', 'believability', 'chemistry', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'superb', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'deservedly', 'so', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'so', 'real', 'actually', 'happening', 'find', 'lowering', 'volume', 'neighbors', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'police.Also', 'excellent', 'Sada', 'Thompson', 'Pollock', 'mother', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'Mrs.', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'real', 'life', 'Peggy', 'Guggenheim.The', 'cinematography', 'set', 'costume', 'design', 'capture', 'look', '20th', 'century', 'America', 'soundtrack', 'Jeff', 'Beal', 'lovely', 'particularly', 'sprightly', 'theme', 'sometimes', 'connect', 'one', 'scene', 'another.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'depiction', 'creative', 'process', 'when', 'discovered', 'drip', 'technique', 'also', 'loved', 'representation', '1950', 'exhibit', 'Betty', 'Parsons', 'Gallery', 'final', 'camera', 'shot', 'zooming', 'paint', 'struggled', 'long', 'hard', 'fame', 'was', 'said', 'quot', 'feel', 'clam', 'shell', 'quot', 'Lee', 'survived', '28', 'years', 'hopefully', 'found', 'peace', 'joy', 'life', 'wonderful', 'work', 'was', 'do', 'once', 'own.This', 'not', 'something', 'view', 'date', 'night', 'fun', 'fascinating', 'film', 'especially', 'someone', 'arts']",Pollock

It is a mesmerizing portrayal of the 20th century's most polarizing artists. Whether you enjoy or dislike Pollock's paintings, this movie is quite moving. Ed Harris studied the character of Pollock deeply--the rough Wyoming artist who hit it big in New York City. He shows Pollock in all his aspects--from an admirable artist to a violent alcoholic to an overweight womanizer.

Pollock is not without his faults--alcoholism among them. Harris' real-life wife, Amy Madigan, stars as socialite Peggy Guggenheim, and Val Kilmer stars as Willem De Kooning.

662124,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005KHJJ,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I have made it pretty clear that I am a huge fan of the biopic.  I love films depicting real life heroes and villains because their stories are presented in such a captivating and raw way.  It's just a thrill to see that fact is far more interesting than fiction.Sometimes.The problem I have with `Pollock' is that it is not presented in that way; not at all.  Sure, it has its interesting moments, and the acting is commanding to an extent, but nothing in `Pollock' feels necessary.  The fact remains that by the time the credits have begun to roll you have forgotten entirely what made Jackson Pollock's life so important in the first place.What was the point in telling his story?See, here is my thing.  In order for the said biopic to be worth its weight it has to feel like it has a reason to be told.  Is their story inspirational, tragic, prophetic, educational; does it present the audience with a clear cut reason to be intrigued?  I recently made a similar criticism on the movie `Bird' which I felt failed to convince us as to the reason Charley Parker's life was so `interesting'.  I have the same thing to say about `Pollock'.  Yes, he was a tormented artist who was possibly bi-polar and was definitely an alcoholic, but honestly, so aren't half of every other artist, musician or actor out there today and of yesteryear.What makes Jackson Pollock so special?I'm still waiting for the answer.Like `Bird', `Pollock' also suffers from spurts of confusion within its storyline, but it is no where near as all over the place as Eastwood's insanely ridiculous direction.  Ed Harris has a deep passion for his character and his film, and while it doesn't all seem to jive he does at least work hard to present it in a way that is, for the most part, understandable.  The film also has a nice feel and flow to it.  I was never bored, I will admit that.  I wanted to follow the film, I wanted to keep watching.  The acting was also quite good.  Harris and Harden were both excellent.  I don't know if I would go as far as to say they were Oscar worthy (nomination worthy, maybe, but win worthy, no) but I was impressed and excited to watch them.In the end my biggest complaint is that the reasons for Harris's passion for Pollock are not made clear to us.  We know that he is obsessed with this man and his work and telling his story, but why?  Why was he so interesting?  Why did his story need to be told?  At least with movies like `Walk the Line' and `Cinderella Man' we are presented with a reason to admire or at least be engaged in these men (they overcame adversity, they worked to clean up their lives, they inspired millions, yada yada) and I'm not saying that just because a life ends tragically does not mean that their story is not worth telling (films like `Boys Don't Cry' or `Monster' cover that department and offer characters with little moral values) but what is always important to remember is that the audience has to feel a reason to watch, and `Pollock' doesn't provide us with that reason.I don't feel that I learn anything from Jackson Pollock or that I gain anything from watching this film, and that is sad because I'm sure there is much to be gathered from the man.  Ed Harris surely feels that way.

When one views all of the supporting documentation in the wonderful DVD package accompanying the film, one recognizes the incredible ways in which Harris literally nails the character dead-on not only in terms of personality, but in terms of style and mannerisms, in his interpretation of this driven alcoholic modern painter compelled to push himself to the limit in pursuing what he thought to be true and authentic in painting.This is a film that is so well done it literally defies comparison with anything recent, and the fact that it was treated relatively shabbily at the Academy Awards (only Marcia Gay Hardin was recognized for her well-deserved Oscar for best supporting actress as Jackson Pollock's long suffering but ever faithful wife Lee Krasner, an accomplished artist in her own right who also was widely recognized for her painting abilities, although not until later in life, after Pollock's death. Also terrific here is Amy Madigan, Harris' real-life wife who turns in a great supporting role as Peggy Guggenheim, one of the very famous and very rich Guggenheims, and a person primarily responsible for bringing Pollock to the attention of the painting public by using her gallery as a showcase for Pollock's astonishing modern works.This film is terrific in every detail, from the Brooklyn accents mastered by Marcia Gay Hardin in her portrayal to the costumes and wardrobe to the cars used to the fabulous 1940s big swing and jazz musical backgrounds employed. The sets are terrific, as is the ensemble acting by the assembled cast.

Emshwiller; POLLOCK is actually almost completely devoid of details of his childhood and early life, which could have given viewers a better glimpse into how Pollock's mind worked. However, excellent performances by Harris and Marcia Gay Harden, in an Oscar winning role as Pollock's loyal; long-suffering wife make this a compelling movie nonetheless.Even though some may be put off by the notion that this could easily be dismissed as a vanity project starring Ed Harris. Directed by Ed Harris. With audio commentary by Ed Harris. And an interview with Ed Harris. And lets not forget the climactic postscript by... Ed Harris.  But I won't bust his ego too much because this is an excellent movie, one which even an avante guarde art hater such as myself enjoyed.The film also features in minor roles a pre-Oscar winning Jennifer Connelly as Pollock's mistress, Bud Cort and a thankfully brief appearance by Val Kilmer with the worst movie hairstyle in recent memory. Worse even than Eddie Griffin in UNDERCOVER BROTHER. They're my only nitpicks. If you're tiring of all the predictable popcorn cinema churned out by Hollywood; then POLLOCK is a good movie to help you escape from that, but viewers will need to be patient with it in order to reap the full rewards.

I'm a big fan of Ed Harris going back to The Right Stuff.  It is my understanding that Harris is a fan of Pollack and that this movie and subject is a project that Harris poured his time, money, energy and heart into.  Pollack was born in Cody, Wyoming (the youngest of four or five brothers).  He spent a lot of time in the west before moving to NYC (the village circa 1930) with a brother.  I guess he studied some under Thomas Hart Benton who must not have been much of an influence.  Pollack seems to have been your typical tortured and sensitive artist who was saved by a very kind and forgiving Ms Krasner (another artist and his wife).  Pollack, an extreme alcoholic, would have never made the famous paintings he made w/o Krasner.  She gave him some stability.  Would like to read more about Pollack.

I've read a great deal about him and studied his work carefully, seeing the originals whenever feasible.  Ed Harris achieves the seemingly impossible, he becomes Pollock for this film. The only time Pollock was in control of his life was when he was painting. Otherwise, he was a disaster with massive psychiatric and alcoholism problems.  Harris conveys this perfectly and even had me convinced that he too must be painter in his private life.  All his movements and expressions when Pollock paints are dead on perfect imitations of what painters really do.  I've read less about Pollock's wife, Lee Krasner, but I'm familiar with her work and how she kept Pollock going as long as he did.  Thus, I don't know how close Harden is to the real Krasner but she does an outstanding job of convincing me that she is Krasner.  Actually, Pollock's life should come as no suprise.  If you've really looked at those paintings, the person who painted them couldn't have possibly lived what anyone else considers a regular life.  I suppose that some may complain that the film itself is a little too linear, too standard biopic fare.  Admittedly, it does not open up any new territory in biopic film.

662134,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005KHJJ,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This film, directed by Ed Harris, who also plays the lead role of Jackson Pollock, is a rare, intelligent, thoughtful and courageous work of art in its own right. The film deserves great praise. I say this because many challenges had to be overcome to produce a film that reflects the New York and world art scene of the 1940s and 1950s; reflects on the work of a singular tempestuous genius of that period; explores his talents and his many demons; and maintains a storyline that can be adapted from life experiences to the motion picture screen. I will cover all four of these aspects of the film in this review.First, however, I think a comment should be made regarding the super job that Ed Harris does at portraying this dark genius. He is brooding, pensive, angry, defeated, overly sensitive, and reclusive and non-communicative. Some of these emotions are easier to portray than others. Harris hits them all perfectly. It is Marcia Gay Harden who emotionally holds the film together, the way Lee Krasner emotionally held Jackson Pollock together. Harden well deserves the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Jeffrey Tambor is perfect as art critic Clement Greenberg and Amy Madigan is great as Peggy Guggenheim. The early scene where Peggy Guggenheim throws a temper tantrum because she had to walk up 5 flights of stairs to see Pollock's studio is a very nice scene, revealing that Pollock was not the only one around who was strung a bit too tight.During the 1930s and 1940s, the works of Matisse and Picasso dominated the international art world. They are such influential masters that their work still continues to influence after almost 70 years. The dominance of Europe over America in terms of painting had been established for over 100 years and America had never produced artists that could compete for the top positions in the art world. However after the defeat of Europe at the end of World War II, the momentum began to change and an American expressive style began to develop. Of course this movement had its roots in Surrealism, European artists who had migrated to America such as Arshille Gorky and Willem de Kooning, the writings of psychologists Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung regarding the working of the unconscious; the art-philosophical writings and paintings of Kandinsky; and the championship of art critics that could articulate the emergence of an American style - powerfully reinvented from the host of influences that swirled behind it. The film is able to tell this story carefully without becoming an art history lesson. Bits of the art history story are interwoven into the script in a careful manner so that there is no sense of lecture but rather of a natural history of social influences acting upon the actors in the art scene of the time.The film was absolutely honest in showing that Pollock's style did not arise full blown and complete but rather was influenced by the surrealists and the other painters of his era. However he took these influences and combined them with influence from Chinese screen and scroll painting and with an expansiveness that captures the wide spaces of the American experience. Greenberg's theory that paint should only be paint, should only be what it is, not a representation of something else, also influenced the breakthrough that was Pollock's drip canvases. These paintings directed the world of art away from Paris and toward New York City.Pollock was haunted by demons and an alcoholic. The film does a great job of showing that the alcoholism did not create his genius but rather distracted from his creativity. Lee Krasner struggles to hold her husband together even though he is haunted by some dark unknown sense of failure and remorse paired with suppressed anger.  Alcoholism covers the pain and anger only so well before it erupts and creates scenes of deprivation and abject misery and self loathing - which start the cycle downward all over again. It is during his periods of sobriety that he moves toward genius.The storyline must follow the trajectory of the modern art movement in America but also follow the rocky fifteen year relationship between Pollock and Lee Krasner. He meets her when he is already an alcoholic man of 29 and end when he dies in a car crash at age 44. The period 1941 until 1956 is that period when the momentum for originality shifted from Europe to America and swept up a brilliant cluster of artistic talent onto the stage. A range of actors play Tony Smith, Franz Klein, and others from this period. Val Kilmer plays the handsome Willem de Kooning, the artist that eventually triumphs in this collection of exceptional talent.In some ways the film is also an excellent reflection on the destruction of alcoholism and it deals with the terrors and shame and destruction of alcoholism like few films have before. Ed Harris produced an exceptional work of art in this film.",5,Tormented soul and a brilliant talent,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,4897,"['film', 'directed', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'also', 'lead',

Then the story of Jackson Pollock would be a lifetime of christmases every single day.In life, Pollock lumbered from one god awful mess to the other. In between messes, he created some more. He drank too much, felt too much, and made everyone near him as unhappy as he was. Then, he died. This is not a happy film and it is not an easy one to watch. It is depressing, and rather like watching the aftermath of a road accident. If you are depressed when you start watching it, you will get worse. If you are happy, and pay attention, you will most probably stop being happy at some point while watching it. You have been warned.That said, POLLOCK is a brilliant film. Ed Harris directs with true talent, and puts in easily the best perfomance of his career. When one is speaking of Ed Harris, that is high praise indeed. Harris acts the part of Jackson Pollock with so much intensity that I was sometimes half convinced that he could jump through the screen and start physically attacking me. This is an odd experience. Imagine Frank Booth in David Lynch's BLUE VELVET. Jack the voulme control up from 11 to somewhere in the low 90's. Add brilliant dialogue. Now imagine that the character is someone you want desperately to LIKE. Now imagine that the character is in just about every single scene.POLLOCK is not an easy film to watch.

I'll just say that Pollack, the film, has quality and intelligence and was obviously a labor of love for the volatile Ed Harris, who shares, I think, some of the inner characteristics of the man he portrays here. As for the story it tells, admirers of this mid-last-century painter will find it sticks relatively faithfully to the grim biographies of the real life figures at its heart, primarily Jackson Pollack and his longsuffering wife Lee Krasner, but with a fluffy Peggy Guggenheim given her due as well. It can also be conceded that the motion picture, Pollack, pulls few punches in its honest depiction of the deterioration of its tormented title figure. Among its cast Jennifer Connelly, as Pollack's mistress Ruth Kligman, convincingly plays a character younger than her real life years, and Marcia Gay Harden's thankless task of bringing onto the screen Lee Krasner's many sacrifices shouldn't be overlooked amid Harris' tactile turn as the self-destructive Pollack. The scene of Harris and the bird in Pollack's garden, while perhaps meant to be symbolic, was actually even at surface level a lovely shot that came off like a delicate haiku in the midst of this otherwise often loud and confrontational motion picture.

Both Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden have taken the time to perfect their artform and are far from the smiling faces visibly reading notecards off camera that we have all become so used to seeing.  In fact, watching this film is a visual feast because it suggests (even if it doesn't always hit the mark itself) what a movie is capable of becoming if competent actors are employed.The story of Jackson Pollock is not a particularly satisfying one.  With most artists, there is a violent debate over which handful out of the masses of talented people are going to be recognized as the ones who really shaped the creative directions of their time.  This debate is especially interesting when it comes to Jackson Pollock, whose drip style of painting has many people convinced he was a no-talent ... who simply coasted by on what amounted to a ""The emperor has no clothes"" type of trick.  For whatever reason, I personally have always enjoyed Pollock's paintings, so this side of Pollock's story is not particularly compelling for me.  However, it does represent a direction the movie could have taken but chose not to.  It is clear that Harris chose not to construct a metaphorical representation of the man that tried to articulate and explain his importance as an artist, but instead elected to present Pollock as he actually was.  That is, in an unflattering light.  In a sense, this choice is a testament not only to Pollock's reputation as an artist, but the strength of his personality, for at the end of the movie it is clear that the filmakers believe we will see him as a brilliant man despite the fact that they bombarded us with two hours of almost exclusively the lowest moments of his life.In a way, the brutally honest handling of Pollock does allow the audience to get deep inside his head.  The chaos of his personal life is sort of reflected in his bizarre and abstract works, though this is not a connection the movie strains to make.  In fact, the movie never strains at all, which is what is so appealing about it, it is almost entirely non-manipulative.  Or if it does manipulate, it does so in the direction opposite from that which would most benifit the picture.  The decision was to present Pollock the man not Pollock the artist, and the motivation seems to be that you get one with the other.Not enough can be said about Harris' performance.  He is so totally immersed in the role that even his energetic painting scenes seem totally authentic.  Imagine an actor pretending to be Jimi Hendrix playing the guitar and you'll recognize the difficulty.  There are some icons that are so indellibly planted in our consciousness that any falseness in their representation is immediately apparent.  The real revelation is Marcia Gay Harden, both for her performance and the complexity of the character she plays.  Again, there is a strong authenticity to her role as the woman who basicly took care of everything in Pollock's life so that he could concentrate, some might say selfishly, entirely on his work.  One might ask if freeing up the man so that he can be in such frequent undistracted contact with his inner demons was actually benifical to him, or humanity in general.All in all, there are some times when this film is rather slow and begins to lose the attention of its viewers.  Anybody who has any background in art should not miss it however as it does provide a wonderful opportunity to familiarize the events of Pollock's life and make your own decision about their worthiness.",4,Great Performances!,996883200,"08 4, 2001",2001,3681,"['era', 'teenyboper', 'movie', 'stars', 'who', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'cars', 'order', 'alcohol', 'yet', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'driven', 'performances', 'two', 'increadible', 'actors', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'perfect', 'artform', 'are', 'far', 'smiling', 'visibly', 'reading', 'notecards', 'camera', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'used', 'seeing', 'fact', 'watching', 'film', 'visual', 'feast', 'even', ""n't"", 'always', 'hit', 'mark', 'what', 'movie', 'capable', 'becoming', 'competent', 'actors', 'are', 'employed.The', 'story', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'not', 'particularly', 'satisfying', 'one', 'most', 'artists', 'violent', 'debate', 'handful', 'masses', 'talented', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'recognized', 'ones', 'who', 'really', 'shaped', 'creative', 'directions', 'time', 'debate', 'especially', 'interesting', 'when', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'drip', 'style', 'painting', 'many', 'people', 'convinced', 'was', 'no-talent', 'who', 'simply', 'coasted', 'amounted', 'emperor', 'clothes', 'type', 'trick', 'reason', 'personally', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Pollock', 'paintings', 'side', 'Pollock', 'story', 'not', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'However', 'represent', 'direction', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'chose', 'not', 'clear', 'Harris', 'chose', 'not', 'construct', 'metaphorical', 'representation', 'man', 'tried', 'articulate', 'explain', 'importance', 'artist', 'instead', 'elected', 'present', 'Pollock', 'actually', 'was', 'unflattering', 'light', 'sense', 'choice', 'testament', 'not', 'only', 'Pollock', 'reputation', 'artist', 'strength', 'personality', 'end', 'movie', 'clear', 'filmakers', 'believe', 'will', 'see', 'brilliant', 'man', 'fact', 'bombarded', 'two', 'hours', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'lowest', 'moments', 'life.In', 'way', 'brutally', 'honest', 'handling', 'Pollock', 'allow', 'audience', 'get', 'deep', 'head', 'chaos', 'personal', 'life', 'sort', 'reflected', 'bizarre', 'abstract', 'works', 'not', 'connection', 'movie', 'make', 'fact', 'movie', 'never', 'what', 'so', 'appealing', 'almost', 'entirely', 'non-manipulative', 'manipulate', 'so', 'direction', 'opposite', 'would', 'most', 'benifit', 'picture', 'decision', 'was', 'present', 'Pollock', 'man', 'not', 'Pollock', 'artist', 'motivation', 'be', 'get', 'one', 'other.Not', 'enough', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Harris', 'performance', 'so', 'totally', 'immersed', 'role', 'even', 'energetic', 'painting', 'scenes', 'seem', 'totally', 'authentic', 'Imagine', 'actor', 'pretending', 'be', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'playing', 'guitar', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'difficulty', 'are', 'icons', 'are', 'so', 'indellibly', 'planted', 'consciousness', 'falseness', 'representation', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'real', 'revelation', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'performance', 'complexity', 'character', 'Again', 'strong', 'authenticity', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'basicly', 'took', 'care', 'everything', 'Pollock', 'life', 'so', 'could', 'concentrate', 'might', 'say', 'selfishly', 'entirely', 'work', 'One', 'might', 'ask', 'freeing', 'up', 'man', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'frequent', 'undistracted', 'contact', 'inner', 'demons', 'was', 'actually', 'benifical', 'humanity', 'general.All', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'rather', 'slow', 'lose', 'attention', 'viewers', 'Anybody', 'who', 'background', 'art', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'however', 'provide', 'wonderful', 'opportunity', 'familiarize', 'events', 'Pollock', 'life', 'make', 'own', 'decision', 'worthiness']",Pollock
662145,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B00005KHJJ,D. Hartley,"[7, 8]","This well-acted film about abstract artist Jackson Pollock is such an obvious labor of love for director/star Ed Harris that it hurts me to report that, while it is excellent as an acting excercise, it is rather sketchy (no pun intended) as a biography. Harris (who appears to have added some pounds to his usually wiry frame a la DeNiro in ""Raging Bull"") completely absorbs himself in the role, reminiscent of Kirk Douglas' tortured Van Gogh in ""Lust For Life"". Marcia Gay Harden delivers a star-making performance as Pollock's wife, and Harris' real-life wife Amy Madigan is a hoot as the eccentric art patron Peggy Guggenheim. The film is flawed, however, in the part of the story it DOESN'T tell; namely, what happened to Pollock to make him so tortured?

While the facts of Pollock's illnes,s and Krasner's devotion to him and his work, are as documented in the various biographies, one should not take the film to be the reality of the two persons. It is a reflection in a distorted mirror in which neither the internal nor external realities can be more than suggested. Not a criticism of this film, no film can do more than insinuate realities if, for no other reason, that the dimensions of time, thought and action must be compressed almost into invisibility.As to the particularities of this venture, clearly one can dismiss all the featured associates, even though based on ""real"" people, since they are brought on screen only as audience for the two central characters. Strong figures like Greenberg are limited to a few more or less vapid comments. Insofar as Pollock and Krasner are concerned, we are told next to nothing of the social context which formed them and within which their interactions took place. How is the audience to understand what is signified by the epithet thrown at Krasner, ""Jewish Bitch"", I believe it was, or the brief interchange about getting married, in which Pollock is heard to say, they had to be married in a church, followed up by, in what church. What on earth could be made of that from what the film has told us.My point is, simply, that in making a good film, much of reality has to be sacrificed to the demands of the medium. If one is interested in the life of Pollock (and/or Krasner), in the art of Pollock (and/or Krasner), one might take this as a preface to the further study of these things.

662153,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005KHJJ,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 6]","This film has my vote as one of the best films of 2000.  It is a film that succeeds on every level.  Ed Harris delivers a tour de force exhibition of acting and directorial prowess in this intense and intelligent biopic on the life of Jackson Pollock.For Harris this was not so much a filmmaking project as it was a personal obsession.  Harris, who is himself a painter, had thought about making a biographical film about Pollock for over a decade.  When Steven Naifeh published the book, ""Jackson Pollock: An American Saga"", Harris saw his chance.  He turned to Barbara Turner and Susan Emschwiller to write a screenplay based on the book, and he began to immerse himself in an all consuming mania that in many ways was analogous to the frenzied passion of the painter he hoped to portray.From a directorial standpoint, the film is extraordinary in every regard, which is quite remarkable for a first time director.  Harris creates an intricate and complex weave with a character study that is simultaneously moving, exhilarating and tragic.  The period renderings are meticulously correct, from the costumes and furniture to the cars and the vintage packages on the shelves of the country store.  The music selection is a fantastic swirl of big band and other jazz standards from the 1940's from Benny Goodman to Billie Holiday.  The photography (with kudos to cinematographer Lisa Rinzler) is excellent with some extraordinary lighting effects, especially the backlit scene where Jackson and Lee first make love.  As if all of this weren't enough, Harris induces unbelievably compelling performances out of all the cast members.Harris has always been an artist among celebrities, a hard working and accomplished actor living on the fringes in supporting roles or minor leads.  Given the freedom afforded by producing, directing and acting in this film, his talent and skill shine forth unencumbered.  His performance is nothing short of phenomenal.  He seems more like he is channeling than acting.  The DVD includes some footage of the actual Pollock at work and after seeing this, Harris' portrayal takes on an almost eerie realism.  In the painting scenes, Harris like Pollock attacks the canvas like a man possessed, with rapid strokes that make it seem as if his muscles can't react as fast as the genius that is flowing forth.  In the dramatic scenes, Harris delivers a white hot performance of a tormented and moody genius struggling with alcohol addiction and an enormous inferiority complex.  He received his third Oscar nomination for this performance, his first for best actor.  I don't know if Harris will ever be able to surpass his performance here, given the level of dedication and inspiration he possessed regarding the subject matter, but I certainly hope this opens opportunities in both lead acting roles and directorial projects worthy of his abilities.Marcia Gay Hardin gives a performance that goes stride for stride with Harris.  She won the Oscar for best supporting actress and fully deserved it.  She captures the essence of Lee Krasner's unbending devotion to Pollock, subjugating her own painting pursuits to support and promote his career (Krasner went on to become a prominent artist in her own right after Pollock's death).  Her 1940's Brooklyn accent is superb, as is her command of the zeitgeist of the intelligentsia of the period.  Amy Madigan is also terrific as Peggy Guggenheim, the flamboyant gallery owner and niece of Solomon R.

662154,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00005KHJJ,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[4, 5]","Ed Harris has only directed one film in his career; this one. He hand-carried the property around town for 15 years. This stirring heartfelt movie is a testament to his grit and creativity. Then he gathered up a group of other producers, and some of his friends, and he directed it and starred in it; probably for scale. Sometimes this formula can lead to a travesty, but not in this case. Harris gave us a lean vision of a great artist and a miserable human being. His father had pointed out to him his physical resemblence to Pollock. But this was only a starting point for Harris. He played Pollock completely, living in the painter's skin, inhabiting his bones.Roger Ebert wrote,""Harris may not be a painter, but he sure knows how to look like he is painting."" This film stands on the shoulders of most all of the other Artist bio-pics. Harris as Pollock was better than Charles Laughton as Rembrandt, better than Anthony Hopkins as Picasso, better than Charlton Heston as Michelangelo; and he was equally as good as Anthony Quinn playing Gauguin, and Kirk Douglas playing Van Gogh in LUST FOR LIFE.Harris was fearless in portraying the less sympathetic aspects of Pollock's personality; the manic-depression, the alcoholism, the vaulted ego and the bottomless insecurity. Having done his research, Harris was aware that Pollock had come from Wyoming, arriving at New York like a hard-drinking brawling cowboy let loose in a world of soft hands, lisps, and ambiguous sexuality; the pre-war Art world of NYC. Tennessee Williams had know Pollock. It was rumored that he had him in mind when creating the character of Stanley Kowalski.Ed Harris used it all, integrated it and wore it like a dirty pair of underwear. When Pollock painted, he seemed free of his demons. Harris conveyed this exceedingly well. As Ebert wrote further,"" Painting was his gift. It lifted him out of his misery.""  Harris was nominated for an Oscar, and he should have won it.The first rate script, written by two women, hummed along in perfect pitch, making the female characters more accessible. Pollock needed guidance, management, and manintenance. His wife, Lee Krasner, provided these things. Marcia Gay Harden did her finest work in this role, earning her academy award. She seemed comfortable in the period hairstyles, clothes, and ambience. She moved with assurance of a woman who was the stronger, the wiser, and the most assertive of the pair. She, too, was an artist, but she set aside her art, and became Pollock's muse, lover, mother, and agent.Jeffrey Tambor stood out as Clement Greenburg, the art critic that first disliked Pollock's work, and later championed it. An underrated actor, Tambor has never been better. Amy Madegan, married to Ed Harris, added a lot to the picture by playing the millionaire socialite patroness Peggy Guggenheim. She startled us with her sweptback coif, and the petty arrogance of a wealthy woman who collected artists like other women collected green stamps. Jennifer Connelly was pretty good as Pollock's young groupie, Ruth Kligman, who would break up his marriage, and then die at his side in the front seat of his Cadillac convertible.Several other supporting roles were exceptionally cast with strong actors. Bud Cort, who can now play old asthmatic codgers like Walter Brennan used to, was appropriately fussy and effective as Howard Putzel, the Guggenheim majordomo. John Heard as Tony Smith and Val Kilmer as Willen DeKooning provided effective window dressing in well done cameos. Sada Thompson played Pollock;s mother, Stella, like a deer caught in the headlights. She never seemed to fully forgive him for his eccentricities and insensitivities.This is the best movie ever released about a famous artist. I enjoyed it very much. Any biography about a tragic genius can run astray, tossing us onto a rollercoaster of angst, bathos, and madness. Even though Ed Harris took us to all those places, he let the camera stay focused on Jackson Pollock, and he let us for our own judgements.",4,Jack the Dripper,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,4018,"['Ed', 'Harris', 'only', 'directed', 'one', 'film', 'career', 'one', 'hand-carried', 'property', 'town', '15', 'years', 'stirring', 'heartfelt', 'movie', 'testament', 'grit', 'creativity', 'Then', 'gathered', 'up', 'group', 'other', 'producers', 'friends', 'directed', 'starred', 'probably', 'scale', 'Sometimes', 'formula', 'can', 'lead', 'travesty', 'not', 'case', 'Harris', 'gave', 'lean', 'vision', 'great', 'artist', 'miserable', 'human', 'being', 'father', 'had', 'pointed', 'out', 'physical', 'resemblence', 'Pollock', 'was', 'only', 'starting', 'point', 'Harris', 'played', 'Pollock', 'completely', 'living', 'painter', 'skin', 'inhabiting', 'bones.Roger', 'Ebert', 'wrote', 'Harris', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'painter', 'sure', 'how', 'look', 'painting', 'film', 'shoulders', 'most', 'other', 'Artist', 'bio-pics', 'Harris', 'Pollock', 'was', 'better', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Rembrandt', 'better', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Picasso', 'better', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Michelangelo', 'was', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'playing', 'Gauguin', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'playing', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'LUST', 'FOR', 'LIFE.Harris', 'was', 'fearless', 'portraying', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'aspects', 'Pollock', 'personality', 'manic-depression', 'alcoholism', 'vaulted', 'ego', 'bottomless', 'insecurity', 'Having', 'done', 'research', 'Harris', 'was', 'aware', 'Pollock', 'had', 'come', 'Wyoming', 'arriving', 'New', 'York', 'hard-drinking', 'brawling', 'cowboy', 'let', 'loose', 'world', 'soft', 'hands', 'lisps', 'ambiguous', 'sexuality', 'pre-war', 'Art', 'world', 'NYC', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'had', 'know', 'Pollock', 'was', 'rumored', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'creating', 'character', 'Stanley', 'Kowalski.Ed', 'Harris', 'used', 'integrated', 'wore', 'dirty', 'pair', 'underwear', 'When', 'Pollock', 'painted', 'seemed', 'free', 'demons', 'Harris', 'conveyed', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'Ebert', 'wrote', 'further', 'Painting', 'was', 'gift', 'lifted', 'misery', 'Harris', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'it.The', 'first', 'rate', 'script', 'written', 'two', 'women', 'hummed', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'making', 'female', 'characters', 'more', 'accessible', 'Pollock', 'needed', 'guidance', 'management', 'manintenance', 'wife', 'Lee', 'Krasner', 'provided', 'things', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'did', 'finest', 'work', 'role', 'earning', 'academy', 'award', 'seemed', 'comfortable', 'period', 'hairstyles', 'clothes', 'ambience', 'moved', 'assurance', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'stronger', 'wiser', 'most', 'assertive', 'pair', 'too', 'was', 'artist', 'set', 'aside', 'art', 'became', 'Pollock', 'muse', 'lover', 'mother', 'agent.Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'stood', 'out', 'Clement', 'Greenburg', 'art', 'critic', 'first', 'disliked', 'Pollock', 'work', 'later', 'championed', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Tambor', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Amy', 'Madegan', 'married', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'added', 'lot', 'picture', 'playing', 'millionaire', 'socialite', 'patroness', 'Peggy', 'Guggenheim', 'startled', 'sweptback', 'coif', 'petty', 'arrogance', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'who', 'collected', 'artists', 'other', 'women', 'collected', 'green', 'stamps', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Pollock', 'young', 'groupie', 'Ruth', 'Kligman', 'who', 'would', 'break', 'up', 'marriage', 'then', 'die', 'side', 'front', 'seat', 'Cadillac', 'convertible.Several', 'other', 'supporting', 'roles', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'cast', 'strong', 'actors', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'who', 'can', 'now', 'play', 'old', 'asthmatic', 'codgers', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'used', 'was', 'appropriately', 'fussy', 'effective', 'Howard', 'Putzel', 'Guggenheim', 'majordomo', 'John', 'Heard', 'Tony', 'Smith', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Willen', 'DeKooning', 'provided', 'effective', 'window', 'dressing', 'well', 'done', 'cameos', 'Sada', 'Thompson', 'played', 'Pollock', 'mother', 'Stella', 'deer', 'caught', 'headlights', 'never', 'seemed', 'fully', 'forgive', 'eccentricities', 'insensitivities.This', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'released', 'famous', 'artist', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'Any', 'biography', 'tragic', 'genius', 'can', 'run', 'astray', 'tossing', 'rollercoaster', 'angst', 'bathos', 'madness', 'Even', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'took', 'places', 'let', 'camera', 'stay', 'focused', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'let', 'own', 'judgements']",Pollock

I recently watched it again at a friend's on a verysmall screen.  It lost a great deal in the transition.As others have noted, some of the best scenes in this film are those that show the artist at work. It's to Ed Harris's credit, both as sctor and as director that these shots do not seem forced or hokey.  In fact, these sequences have an intensity that is impossible to fake.  However, it is precisely at these moments that you want to viewing the film in the best possible setting. If you're watching Harris/Pollock attack a huge canvas on a small screen, the discrepancy is just too jarring.As a dramatic effort,  &quot;Pollock&quot; is not perfect--although it powerfully acted, as nearly everyone who's reviewed it has noted.  Harris and Marcia Gay Harden deserved all the acclaim they received, and if you care about such things, you could say Harris &quot;wuz robbed&quot; at last year's Academy Awards. (Didn't the voters realize there'd be plenty of future occasions to honor Russell Crowe?)  The film's shortcomings are those typical of biopics--compressing 15 years of an extraordinary life into a two hour film is not easy, so the film's sketchiness is not surprising.  Still one does not walk away from the film feeling that one has finally &quot;gotten&quot; Pollock, assuming such a thing is even possible.And it might have helped if the characters aged a little more.  Marcia Gay Harden does appear with glasses in the latter scenes, a concession to aging, but did Lee Krasner never change her hairstyle in all that time? (Who knows, maybe she didn't: perhaps I'm quibbling here.)&quot;Pollock&quot; reminds me in some ways of another actor's long-in-making labor of love, Robert Duvall's &quot;The Apostle.&quot;  Neither film was perfect, but from an acting standpoint, both film's provided their stars with what will likely prove the roles of their careers.  Most often consigned to co-starring roles in bigger productions, these capable actors finally get to shine in projects that they've developed and sponsored.

Mr Harris is very good at establishing cinematically relevant points with economy - the initial seduction by Ms Krasner, the dynamics of family at table, the imperatives of the alcoholic who has to have a sip whilst being embraced by his wife.  He is also playing the role, and relies on his considerable acting skills to depict ageing rather than rely on makeup.

662162,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00005KHJJ,Jean E. Pouliot,"[0, 2]","""Pollock"" is a masterpiece that explores the interplay between mental imbalance, the artistic impulse in a post-war context as embodied in the person of Jackson Pollock. Ed Harris is phenomenal as Pollock. He looks like him, and paints like him, with masterful brushwork that communicates Pollock's visionary talent, his eccentric style and his inner longing for recognition. The film is often hard to watch. Pollock was a hard drinker and not completely stable mentally. His brother and mother are supportive, but it is really fellow artist Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden) who helps Pollock to focus, and keeps him away from those who would unbalance him. Harris and Harden are phenomenal leads, and make the story completely believable.This film depicts a fairly broad slice of Pollock's life, from about 1942, when he was painting wild, impressionistic canvases, through to his breakthrough in the early 1950s with the splatter technique, to his death in 1956. Anyone who has seen any of Pollock's paintings knows that they are much more than a childish mess. Each painting has a symmetry, mood and pulsing energy that is exciting to witness. The movie gives us a sense of how Pollock painted, and the passion that went in to each.The film could have ended at the peak of Pollock's career, and it seemed that it almost did. A ""four years later"" episode, in which a 30-pounds-heavier Ed Harris plays Pollock in his pitiful final days, seems tacked on and unnecessary. I saw no point in depicting the car crash that ended his life. While I am kvetching, the DVD extras weren't anything special. Charlie Rose interviews a surprisingly hostile or inarticulate Ed Harris, and adds nothing to the film.But ""Pollock"" is an incredible film, with a vibrant soundtrack, exceptional acting, terrific period decor and believable characters. It serves as an apt paean to the genius of a great, if troubled, American artist.",5,Phenomenal (in spite of stupid ending),1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,1913,"['Pollock', 'masterpiece', 'interplay', 'mental', 'imbalance', 'artistic', 'impulse', 'post-war', 'context', 'embodied', 'person', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'phenomenal', 'Pollock', 'paints', 'masterful', 'brushwork', 'Pollock', 'visionary', 'talent', 'eccentric', 'style', 'inner', 'longing', 'recognition', 'film', 'often', 'hard', 'watch', 'Pollock', 'was', 'hard', 'drinker', 'not', 'completely', 'stable', 'mentally', 'brother', 'mother', 'are', 'supportive', 'really', 'fellow', 'artist', 'Lee', 'Krasner', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'who', 'Pollock', 'focus', 'away', 'who', 'would', 'unbalance', 'Harris', 'Harden', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'leads', 'make', 'story', 'completely', 'believable.This', 'film', 'fairly', 'broad', 'slice', 'Pollock', 'life', '1942', 'when', 'was', 'painting', 'wild', 'impressionistic', 'canvases', 'breakthrough', 'early', '1950s', 'splatter', 'technique', 'death', '1956', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Pollock', 'paintings', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'childish', 'mess', 'painting', 'symmetry', 'mood', 'pulsing', 'energy', 'exciting', 'witness', 'movie', 'sense', 'how', 'Pollock', 'painted', 'passion', 'went', 'each.The', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'peak', 'Pollock', 'career', 'seemed', 'almost', 'did', 'A', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'episode', '30-pounds-heavier', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Pollock', 'pitiful', 'final', 'days', 'tacked', 'unnecessary', 'saw', 'point', 'depicting', 'car', 'crash', 'ended', 'life', 'am', 'kvetching', 'DVD', 'extras', 'were', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'surprisingly', 'hostile', 'inarticulate', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'nothing', 'film.But', 'Pollock', 'incredible', 'film', 'vibrant', 'soundtrack', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'terrific', 'period', 'decor', 'believable', 'characters', 'apt', 'paean', 'genius', 'great', 'troubled', 'American', 'artist']",Pollock
662163,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,B00005KHJJ,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[5, 5]","Ed Harris Directed and Starred in this biographical story of the disturbed modern artist, Jackson Pollock.  Marica Gay Harden plays the woman who loved him, believed in him, married him, carried him, managed his carreer, made sure he got recognition, and shared his success while sublimating her own artistry.  Harden deserved her Oscar for this, as her character grows and changes she is omnipresent, but always supporting the story. (Although... she was the female lead in this and should have been in the leading actress category.)Having worked in the art world, I know these people, and there are certainly artists like this, spoiled, self-destructive, completely self absorbed people.  I find this film completely true to life, and Harris the actor and director does an excellent representation of the life-negating focus on the act of artistic creation above all else.  I wonder... if I liked Pollack's work better, would I like the film more.  I'm one of those who think this period of art were a fraud perpetrated by critics and banks, to create a mystique that art can not be understood by all.  Poppycock.What is lacking here is any real explanation of what is a cause of his behavior.  It becomes very clear that his disturbed, dysfunctional, chaotic art was a reflection of his mind, but there is only one brief mention that he was listed 4F from the military because of his mental instability.  In the days when they were conscripting even married men, that is pretty major.  But we always sit outside this character just watching him.  Without a framework of understanding, we are just wading along with an alchoholic, as Hardin's character is, at the mercy of the next binge or insulting behavior.  Although the years pass in this film, we never see progression or growth or even deterioration of the character, just ups and downs that feel repetitious.Harris did not win his Oscar nom., and although his performance -as always - is the work of a great actor, you can see why this didn't win votes... from beginning to end, his tortured character just never goes anywhere.  Harden clearly had a sense of the growth of her character, of how life with this destructive person would wear her and change her.  This portrait of the artist reveals only his turmoil, and rejection of the world, just as his art did.Ultimately, it feels as is Harris himself as actor or director lacked insight into a life overview of the artist, other than - and this may his major point - that it is only the people around an artist who allow him to abuse them and continue to support him when his humanity does not deserve it, that it is the people around an artist who make an artist great.  Definitely worth seeing, as a very real presentation of a trip into the scurvy underbelly of the art world.",3,The Insanity of the Art World,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,2793,"['Ed', 'Harris', 'Directed', 'Starred', 'biographical', 'story', 'disturbed', 'modern', 'artist', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'Marica', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'woman', 'who', 'loved', 'believed', 'married', 'carried', 'managed', 'carreer', 'made', 'sure', 'got', 'recognition', 'shared', 'success', 'sublimating', 'own', 'artistry', 'Harden', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'character', 'grows', 'changes', 'omnipresent', 'always', 'supporting', 'story', 'was', 'female', 'lead', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'leading', 'actress', 'category', 'Having', 'worked', 'art', 'world', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'certainly', 'artists', 'spoiled', 'self-destructive', 'completely', 'self', 'absorbed', 'people', 'find', 'film', 'completely', 'true', 'life', 'Harris', 'actor', 'director', 'excellent', 'representation', 'life-negating', 'focus', 'act', 'artistic', 'creation', 'else', 'wonder', 'liked', 'Pollack', 'work', 'better', 'would', 'film', 'more', ""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'think', 'period', 'art', 'were', 'fraud', 'perpetrated', 'critics', 'banks', 'create', 'mystique', 'art', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'understood', 'Poppycock.What', 'lacking', 'here', 'real', 'explanation', 'what', 'cause', 'behavior', 'very', 'clear', 'disturbed', 'dysfunctional', 'chaotic', 'art', 'was', 'reflection', 'mind', 'only', 'one', 'brief', 'mention', 'was', 'listed', '4F', 'military', 'mental', 'instability', 'days', 'when', 'were', 'conscripting', 'even', 'married', 'men', 'pretty', 'major', 'always', 'sit', 'character', 'just', 'watching', 'framework', 'understanding', 'are', 'just', 'wading', 'along', 'alchoholic', 'Hardin', 'character', 'mercy', 'next', 'binge', 'insulting', 'behavior', 'years', 'pass', 'film', 'never', 'see', 'progression', 'growth', 'even', 'deterioration', 'character', 'just', 'ups', 'downs', 'feel', 'repetitious.Harris', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'Oscar', 'nom.', 'performance', '-as', 'always', 'work', 'great', 'actor', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'votes', 'beginning', 'end', 'tortured', 'character', 'just', 'never', 'anywhere', 'Harden', 'clearly', 'had', 'sense', 'growth', 'character', 'how', 'life', 'destructive', 'person', 'would', 'wear', 'change', 'portrait', 'artist', 'only', 'turmoil', 'rejection', 'world', 'just', 'art', 'did.Ultimately', 'Harris', 'actor', 'director', 'lacked', 'insight', 'life', 'overview', 'artist', 'other', 'may', 'major', 'point', 'only', 'people', 'artist', 'who', 'allow', 'abuse', 'continue', 'support', 'when', 'humanity', 'not', 'deserve', 'people', 'artist', 'who', 'make', 'artist', 'great', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'very', 'real', 'presentation', 'trip', 'scurvy', 'underbelly', 'art', 'world']",Pollock

Once one is finished with the book, Harris' job as director, producer and actor becomes even more impressive as he and his production team manage to brilliantly capture the book's insights and nuances as they bring Pollock to life on film.Pollock itself is a work of art in the sense that all its respective elements labor effortlessly in a unified manner that truly reveals universe. The set design and cinematography is perfectly flawless. The use of color and texture makes the film breathe and move in a manner not usually seen. It is so refreshing to see a film that treats its artistic environment and photography like a three dimensional character. Make special notice of The Pollock's house as it evovles from delapidated rustic to pre-Yuppie (for the 1950's!) along with his rise in fame.I must make a special note about the film's excellent score. It sounds almost as if Harris ressurected Aaron Copeland to score his film. It is a lush, romantic mixture of western themes with a musical manifestation of Pollock's drip painting. I now own the CD and it has become one of my favorite film soundtracks. Why it wasn't nominated for the Oscar is well beyond me.I cannot possibly say enough about the performances. Harden and Harris are absolutely brilliant. That is all I can say. They both manage to bring to life all the complexities of the characters, warts and all. They truly inspire pity and fear.At least Harden was rightfully honored with an Oscar. Harris losing to Crowe this year is yet another example of Oscar's relative innanity.Pollock as a film does not mindlessly canonize Pollock the man.

Harris as the actor/director of ""Pollock"" spent decades practicing and learning who Jackson Pollock was, how his life evolved, and successfully transferred that into a brilliant work, in and of itself. The actor felt more than a kinship...more than a calling...it was a devotional responsibility to portray a human being who made a quantum leap in art.Some ask, what is the point of Pollock's life...why celebrate another tortured soul who vacillated between madness and genius, and quite honestly made life hell for those around him??? IMHO, the ""Why"" is simple...because it is that line...between genius and madness that is so compelling, so wondrous when actualized that it makes a difference. For Jackson Pollock, his ART made a difference...and what a difference! A gigantic leap into modern art...born in the USA.Pollock: the artist who changed the course of modern art with his revolutionary style, mimicking Asian art by painting on the floor and boldly allowing the energy of his art to unfold, without touching his brush to the canvas! What brought me to this movie, was another film, MONA LISA SMILE, its reference scene to Pollock... Julia Roberts teaching her students how to SEE art...what defines it...who defines it? That was enough to send me on the hunt and the prize was well worth it.Harris was impeccable in conveying an alcoholic, manic depressive with raging internal ""brain wars."" The aforementioned term is one learned from another who endures walking ""on the edge"" between sanity and madness, and my respect for her is boundless. Pollack's rapidly changing and intense moods were captured with sensitivity and accuracy, for the viewer came to know the challenge of being in Pollock's circle. A huge sense of admiration the woman who was able to draw the best from Jackson, to see beyond the madness, to love him in spite of himself...his wife, Lee Krasner, beautifully rendered by Marcia Gay Harden. I was hugely touched by this movie, not only for the devotion of Mr. Harris, and the achievements of Mr. Pollock, but by the fact that everyone matters...it is not only the heroic, righteous beings who change this world of ours...it is also the suffering, enduringly courageous brilliance within those souls who walk a different path. Ed Harris let us have a glimpse of this...and though not always easy to watch such chaos, it was persuasive, passionate, and beautiful.

662173,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005KHJJ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","Jackson Pollock received some artistic training as a student of the bombastic regionalist Thomas Hart Benton and was known to admire the work of Mexican socialist realists such as Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros.  These influences become fascinating because it is difficult to connect the dots between any of their works and anything done by Pollock.  Pick anything, ""Lavender Mist: Number 1"" or the mural he did for Peggy Guggenheim during World War II, and try to make the connections.  All they have in common is a sense of size.  These were painters who did murals, covering huge areas of canvas with color.  But ultimately the history of art looks at Pollock as creating a unique visual language, painting with trowels, knives, sticks, and dripping paint to create intricate, intertwined lines.""Pollock,"" in which Ed Harris not only plays the artist but works at a director for the first time, deals with Polllock's struggle with alcoholism and depression, which played out not only against his creative work with art, but also in his volatile relationship with his wife, the artist Lee Krausner (Marsha Gay Harden).  At the end of this two hour film, which covers Pollock's life and career from the early 1940s when his work was brought to the attention of Peggy Guggenheim (Amy Madigan) until his death in a car crash in 1956, the one think you will be convinced about is that no matter how great of an artist he was, Jackson Pollock was a miserable human being.  Pollock might have betrayed his wife, who took care of him and made sure he got through the rest of the day that did not involve painting, for a star struck youngster (Jennifer Connelly), but it is also clear he never betrayed his artistic vision, and in the long run that is what matters the most in art.Ultimately ""Pollock"" is an emotional biography more than either a psychological or an artistic one.  The audience is clearly on the outside looking at the outside of Pollock.  The comparison that comes to my mind from more contemporary times is Kurt Cobain, because I see in both the desire to be accepted and to have their new and radical approach to their art form validated by the masses, but being repulsed by that acceptance on some key level.  This is an artist who apparently cared about what the critics said and even asked for more excoriation from them in the confines of his own home.  Pollock reveled in positive publicity so much that he endured being told when to stop painting by some clown filming a documentary of the artist at work.  The Oscar-nominated performance by Harris does really provide answers, but it does provide a clear sense of the depth of torment and the enigma of the artistic mind.  We might not understand where the art comes from, but we at least appreciate the work that was involved and the sheer physical labor of making giant paintings.This film is as much a testament to Ed Harris as it is to Pollock, since it was the actor who first read the book ""Jackson Pollack: An American Sage"" by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, who commissioned the screenplay by Barbara Turner and Susan Ernshwiller, who put together the funding for the film,  and who ended up directing the picture as well.  The physical comparison between the actor and the artist is striking, but Harris gets well beyond skin deep with this performance, which justifies his name being on the short list of actors who are long over due an Academy Award.  You will probably still need to find a decent biography to understand the significance of the art critic Clement Greenberg (Jeffrey Tambor) and the super rich Peggy Guggenheim in legitimating Abstract Expressionism, but to better understand Jackson Pollock after you watch this film you just have to go and lose yourself in the paintings.

Not only does he star in the film, he also commissioned the screenplay, raised the money for its production and directed it.  It is the story of the American abstract impressionist painter, Jackson Pollock, whose work was brilliant and whose life was miserable.Marcia Gay Harden plays the role of Pollock's wife, Lee Krasner, who stands by her husband through his alcoholism and his manic depressive fits.  He's a troubled man, tortured by his own dark side.  And yet, the film wisely never falls into the trap of trying to psychoanalyze.  Instead, it lets Pollock's behavior speak for him.  His demons are right on the surface as we watch him make everyone around him as unhappy as himself.  But we are also treated to seeing the artist at work.  We see him in the act of creation.  We see his technique and his passion for his work.  We see glimpses of pure genius.  And we appreciate the art for the pure art that it is.All this is set against a backdrop of Greenwich Village in the 40s and 50s and the period details are excellent.  This is a time when everyone smoked cigarettes, artists were experimenting with new forms, and the world seemed fresh and bright.  Clothes, hairdos and household details were perfect and added to the sense of time and place.

Jackson Pollock was a great artist, thanks in no small part to his shrewd wife, Lee Krasner. She was the intermediary between this disturbed and ultimately psychotic man and the sophisticated New York art world that never knew quite what to make of him. Compared to today, the postwar New York art scene looks quaintly innocent. All it took was some pontificating by Clement Greenberg and a spread in Life magazine to make Pollock's career. Ed Harris plays Pollock well, and the scenes where he actually paints are fascinating. The film also does a does a good job of showing how artists actually lived in fifties in New York. By today's standards, it was a grubby life in dilapidated walk-ups painted in the harsh, cheap white paint favored by cheap landlords. But it was possible to be poor and still live in Manhattan. In a way, Krasner did her job too well. Pollock was emotionally unprepared for his fame and it sent him (and ultimately, poor Edith Metzger who had the bad luck to be in his car at the wrong time) over the deep end.

662178,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00005KHJJ,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[6, 7]","Pollock traces the life of artist Jackson Pollock from 1941 until his death in 1956. It focuses particularly on the nine years that culminated in Pollock's lionization by Life Magazine as the leading figure of mid-century American art. A project of director/star Ed Harris that was years in the development, Pollock gives equal emphasis to the painter's professional achievements and his troubled personal life. It also highlights the role of Lee Krasner, a fellow modernist painter who became Pollock's lover and later his wife. Krasner, portrayed by Marcia Gay Hardin in an Academy Award-winning performance, effectively relegated her own promising career to the backseat in order to promote Pollock's work, take care of him, and protect him as much as possible from his own demons.Ed Harris has always been one of my favorite guys to watch on the big screen. In a long line of films - including Knightriders, Apollo 13, The Abyss, The Truman Show, and The Right Stuff - the common denominator in Harris's performances has been a kind of surface placidity that can give way suddenly to explosive emotion. That quality fits like a glove on the character of Jackson Pollock, a painfully shy alcoholic given to fits of towering rage. Occasionally, in embodying the extremes of the artist's personality, Harris seems to miss the more delicate shadings in the middle. Nevertheless, it's a mesmerizing performance, the perfect complement to Hardin's loyal, longsuffering Krasner.An extraordinary level of craftsmanship is evident in nearly every aspect of this film. Harris went to great lengths to learn enough of Pollock's celebrated painting style to be able to mimic it with absolute confidence. Some of the most enjoyable moments in the movie are those in which the artist simply works, attacking the canvas with big, looping ribbons and fat dollops of paint. Even the music score that underlies these scenes of triumphant activity is perfect - intricate and understated, as if it didn't want to disturb the painter in the moment of inspiration. Minute attention to period detail and set design impeccably evoke post-World War II America, and the film somehow captures the vigorous optimism of the American art scene that is reflected in the flowering of Abstract Expressionism.Each scene is a small gem, cut with seeming artlessness. In one sequence, Pollock has just traded one of his paintings to a grocery store owner for a case of beer; and now, already a sheet or two to the wind, he's bicycling home with the wooden crate full of bottles perched perilously on the handlebars of his bike. After managing to stay upright for some distance, he pulls a bottle from the case, somehow knocks the top off it, removes the cigarette from his mouth and tries to take a swig from the bottle - all of which he impossibly pulls off until a passing car distracts him and the whole thing comes crashing down. In someone else's movie the scene would be a throwaway, some humorous filler to round out the weightier stuff; but here it's an exquisite miniature of everything that's miraculously right and everything that's tragically wrong with the protagonist. Nothing in this film is thrown away.Pollock isn't always an easy movie to watch. It's certainly not a panegyric to the artist who, while unquestionably brilliant, was also an abusive, self-absorbed drunk. It is, however, an inspiring paean to the redemptive power of creative endeavor. As much as you might scorn the painter for his loutish behavior with Krasner and others, as soon as he picks up the paintbrush and hurls himself into his work, he's got you. In 1949, Life posed the rhetorical question of whether Jackson Pollock was the greatest American artist of his day. That's a question that is probably as difficult to answer today as it was then.

662181,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B00005KHJJ,Mary Whipple,"[1, 3]","When interviewed in 1949, shortly after finding enormous success for his ""spatter"" paintings, Jackson Pollock publicly confronted the issue of whether dripping paint on canvases, rather than putting it there with a brush, creates ""accidental"" paintings.  Originally an abstract expressionist, Pollock's ""spatter"" style evolved from his intense passion and his need to break free from the stylistic confinements imposed by brushwork.  As uncontrolled in his personal life as in his professional life, Pollock was an excessive drinker, inveterate womanizer, and angry rebel against limits of any kind.Playing the role of Pollock (for which he was Oscar-nominated), Ed Harris, obsessed with Pollock's story and his work for almost twenty years, is also the director of this film and a producer.  Depicting Pollock from 1941, when he met and later married Lee Krazner (Marcia Gay Harden), a ""good woman painter,"" through his death in 1955, Harris reveals Pollock's rage, his single-minded determination to be recognized, his rejection of all ""rules,"" his dependence on Krazner's good sense and ability to manage his career, his friendship with collector/patron Peggy Guggenheim (Amy Madigan, Harris's wife) and critic Clem Greenberg (Jeffrey Tambor), and his sober years on Long Island, when he painted his best work.  His return to the bottle and his arrogance characterize his final years.  Harris spent ten years learning to paint, and the scenes in which Pollock, in a frenzy, paints both expressionistic works and ""spatter"" paintings, illustrate the artist's spontaneity and ring with truth.Filming primarily at the museum/home of Pollock on Long Island, Cinematographer Kathryn Himoff lets the characters and setting take center stage, though she frames many scenes for maximum effect, making particularly effective use of doorways and shadows.  The Greenwich Village scene in 1943, in which Pollock, suddenly released from his ""block,"" paints in one night a huge mural for Peggy Guggenheim's apartment, his shadow (or self-destructive spirit) holding the brush with him, is both stunning and psychologically revealing.  Harden portrays her love for Pollock, her ability to manage his career, and her willingness to subordinate her own career for his, while at the same time revealing a core of iron, a feat which won her an Academy Award.Harris is brilliant in revealing as much as it is possible for the law-abiding world to know about a man who completely rejects the canons of ""civilized"" behavior, abiding instead by the canon of creation.  It is a selfish world, one that can wreak havoc on those who love the artist and get in his way.  Harris's direction, however, especially in scenes in which relatives and friends visit Pollock's studio, needed more control or editing.

662182,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005KHJJ,Matthew Horner,"[6, 8]","Ed Harris is both the director and the star of Pollock, a biography of famed American artist Jackson Pollock. His work revolutionized modern art and brought this country to the forefront of culture. His paintings are as complex and difficult to understand as the man himself. His work mesmerizes and inspires some people, but to others it looks like the scribbling of a mad child or perhaps spaghetti on canvas. Viewers who possess an artistic temperament and/or a love for the art world should find the movie to be one of the best recent releases. Those with little interest in art - or, more particularly, in artists - should steer clear, especially since Mr. Pollock was not a very nice guy. In most movies about famous historical icons, the character is cleaned up for public consumption. Mr. Harris' portrayal of Pollock is raw and unnerving. This is what I loved about the film, but it is this same thing that others will hate.The movie covers about a dozen years of the artist's life, beginning in 1941. Pollock is a struggling artist in New York's Greenwich Village. He is also an alcoholic and a manic-depressive. One day a young artist named Lee Krasner [Marcia Gay Harden] drops by his dingy apartment. It seems they are to be in a show together, and she wants to see his work. Though shy and suffering from a massive hangover, he let's her. She is very impressed and asks him to come around anytime to see her paintings. He doesn't show up for three week, which is typical of his behavior. Still, they strike up a friendship and soon become lovers.The movie makes it clear that Krasner walked into this relationship with eyes wide open. She became Pollock's everything, and though he never truly appreciated what she did for him, she stuck by him for many years. There was a lot to put up with. Besides his battle with the bottle, Pollock had a tendency to insult and belittle people, even those who tried to help his career. He was also a notorious womanizer. After a few years, they got married, but when Pollock suggested they have a child, she refused. She knew he was all the child she could ever handle. [This is the movie's most poignant scene.]I don't mean to suggest that there were no good times for Pollock and Krasner. There were a lot of them. In part because she was his staunchest supporter and ally, Pollock became both famous and well to do. They bought a house in Long Island's East Hamptons before the place became chic. He did find some happiness there, but I suspect the only times he was truly happy was when he was painting. But the art work came in fits and spurts, as art often does. It was when he wasn't feeling creative that he was the most miserable and the most apt to bring sorrow to those around him. The demons that possessed him led to a very tragic outcome.Sam Harris is absolutely mesmerizing as Pollock. I don't think I've ever seen the idea that genius and madness go hand in hand so expertly embodied. I like the fact that Mr. Harris chose to give no explanations for Pollock's insanity. He seems to believe that a tortured soul can just happen, and I tend to agree. Some people are born with an inability to fit in. Pollock, for example, was a genius in a visual sense, but he was often inarticulate, unless he was talking about himself. This must have been frustrating to both him and to those around him, for arty types often tend to talk, talk, talk and expect others to do the same. He was also amoral, which puts most people off. An amoral person is one who does socially unacceptable things without ever understanding how or why they are unacceptable.Marcia Gay Harden gets equal raves from this reviewer for her portrayal of Krasner. She gives fire to the character and does a remarkable job in showing us a woman who could be both hard and vulnerable at the same time. She shows us that Krasner was nobody's doormat but was still someone who could set her own aspirations aside in order to help a genuinely talented misfit. Later in life, Krasner became a high respected artist in her own right.I think Pollock will appeal most to people who are more fascinated by people than by technology. For me, it proved to be an exhilarating experience. For others, it will be just a silly story about a man who drank a lot and threw paint on canvas for a living.",5,On my Top Ten List of 2000,1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,4313,"['Ed', 'Harris', 'director', 'star', 'Pollock', 'biography', 'famed', 'American', 'artist', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'work', 'revolutionized', 'modern', 'art', 'brought', 'country', 'forefront', 'culture', 'paintings', 'are', 'complex', 'difficult', 'understand', 'man', 'work', 'mesmerizes', 'people', 'others', 'scribbling', 'mad', 'child', 'perhaps', 'spaghetti', 'canvas', 'Viewers', 'who', 'possess', 'artistic', 'temperament', 'love', 'art', 'world', 'should', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'recent', 'releases', 'little', 'interest', 'art', 'more', 'particularly', 'artists', 'should', 'steer', 'clear', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Pollock', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'nice', 'guy', 'most', 'movies', 'famous', 'historical', 'icons', 'character', 'cleaned', 'up', 'public', 'consumption', 'Mr.', 'Harris', 'portrayal', 'Pollock', 'raw', 'unnerving', 'what', 'loved', 'film', 'same', 'thing', 'others', 'will', 'hate.The', 'movie', 'dozen', 'years', 'artist', 'life', 'beginning', '1941', 'Pollock', 'struggling', 'artist', 'New', 'York', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'also', 'alcoholic', 'manic-depressive', 'One', 'day', 'young', 'artist', 'named', 'Lee', 'Krasner', '[', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', ']', 'drops', 'dingy', 'apartment', 'are', 'be', 'show', 'together', 'see', 'work', 'shy', 'suffering', 'massive', 'hangover', 'let', 'very', 'impressed', 'come', 'around', 'anytime', 'see', 'paintings', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'three', 'week', 'typical', 'behavior', 'Still', 'strike', 'up', 'friendship', 'soon', 'become', 'lovers.The', 'movie', 'clear', 'Krasner', 'walked', 'relationship', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'became', 'Pollock', 'everything', 'never', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'what', 'did', 'stuck', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'lot', 'put', 'up', 'battle', 'bottle', 'Pollock', 'had', 'tendency', 'insult', 'belittle', 'people', 'even', 'who', 'tried', 'help', 'career', 'was', 'also', 'notorious', 'womanizer', 'few', 'years', 'got', 'married', 'when', 'Pollock', 'suggested', 'have', 'child', 'refused', 'knew', 'was', 'child', 'could', 'ever', 'handle', '[', 'movie', 'most', 'poignant', 'scene', ']', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'suggest', 'were', 'good', 'times', 'Pollock', 'Krasner', 'were', 'lot', 'part', 'was', 'staunchest', 'supporter', 'ally', 'Pollock', 'became', 'famous', 'well', 'do', 'bought', 'house', 'Long', 'Island', 'East', 'Hamptons', 'place', 'became', 'chic', 'did', 'find', 'happiness', 'there', 'suspect', 'only', 'times', 'was', 'truly', 'happy', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'painting', 'art', 'work', 'came', 'fits', 'spurts', 'art', 'often', 'was', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'creative', 'was', 'most', 'miserable', 'most', 'apt', 'bring', 'sorrow', 'demons', 'possessed', 'led', 'very', 'tragic', 'outcome.Sam', 'Harris', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'Pollock', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'idea', 'genius', 'madness', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'so', 'expertly', 'embodied', 'fact', 'Mr.', 'Harris', 'chose', 'give', 'explanations', 'Pollock', 'insanity', 'believe', 'tortured', 'soul', 'can', 'just', 'happen', 'tend', 'agree', 'people', 'are', 'born', 'inability', 'fit', 'Pollock', 'example', 'was', 'genius', 'visual', 'sense', 'was', 'often', 'inarticulate', 'was', 'talking', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'frustrating', 'arty', 'types', 'often', 'tend', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'expect', 'others', 'do', 'same', 'was', 'also', 'amoral', 'most', 'people', 'off', 'amoral', 'person', 'one', 'who', 'socially', 'unacceptable', 'things', 'ever', 'understanding', 'how', 'why', 'are', 'unacceptable.Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'equal', 'raves', 'reviewer', 'portrayal', 'Krasner', 'fire', 'character', 'remarkable', 'job', 'showing', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'hard', 'vulnerable', 'same', 'time', 'Krasner', 'was', 'nobody', 'doormat', 'was', 'still', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'set', 'own', 'aspirations', 'aside', 'order', 'help', 'genuinely', 'talented', 'misfit', 'Later', 'life', 'Krasner', 'became', 'high', 'respected', 'artist', 'own', 'right.I', 'think', 'Pollock', 'will', 'appeal', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'fascinated', 'people', 'technology', 'proved', 'be', 'exhilarating', 'experience', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'silly', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'lot', 'threw', 'paint', 'canvas', 'living']",Pollock
662183,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00005KHJJ,Mike Stone,"[4, 5]","PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS I HAD RE: JACKSON POLLOCK AND HIS RELEVANCEI admit to having reservations about &quot;the work&quot;.  Abstract Expressionism itself is a shaky deal in my mind to begin with.  When you throw in the later &quot;splatter&quot; techniques, I get even more uneasy.  Give me massive displays of technique, form, content, colour, light, shadow, etc.  However, I do appreciate Pollock's success in opening up the possibilities of art, and it does all work in theory.  I just don't get a rush looking at his art.Also, the whole tortured artist narrative, in which a man teeters across the line between genius and insanity, eventually toppling over to the side of self-destruction, is a story I've seen too many times by now to still be interested in.CHANGES IN MY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT JACKSON POLLOCK CAUSED BY WATCHING 'POLLOCK' THE MOVIEPollock and his contemporaries, as presented in Ed Harris' very capable movie, were well aware of what they were doing.  They knew that their aspirations to open up the possibilities of art were keeping them away from art's commercial side.  But they had a mission.  Harris' Pollock may not have been the most aware of the bunch (there's one fine scene where, in giving an intellectual interview, Harris appears to be reading his answers off of cue cards written for him by his wife), but he lead the way ably.  His art was more passionate and personal than just a theoretical exercise, and I give Harris much credit in showing me this point.  Also, the scenes in which Pollock is creating his later breakthrough works are wonderfully to watch.  Harris dances around the canvas, and the sense of pure creations is more than palpable.As for the tortured artist narrative, well, there was one thing here that separates this story from others in the same vein.  Pollock meets Lee Krazner (or rather, she forcibly pushes herself into his life), and they eventually marry.  Krazner, an artist in her own right who Pollock himself describes as talented and interesting, decides to repress her ambitions in favour of caring for her tortured genius husband.  And boy does he need it.  There are some wonderful scenes of their relationship where he appears completely incapable of caring for himself (at one point she trims his nails as he looks on in awe).  It's this relationship that forms the core of the film.  The audience must ask themselves: Would I have chosen the same path as Lee?COMMENTS ABOUT 'POLLOCK' THE MOVIE AS CINEMATIC ARTEd Harris looks like Pollock, without much call for make-up (except in the later scenes showing Pollock's demise, where a fine job was done making him appear fat and bearded).  His quiet intensity was well done, especially when contrasted with the periodic moments of wild anger.  And there were just enough moments of Pollock in bliss (one scene of him lying in a field on a beautiful sunny day flirting with a nearby bird, was utopia personified) to balance the dark side nicely.  Harris' acting job overshadows the job he did as a director.  I will say that he handled the double-duty equally well from both ends.Marcia Gay Harden did a wonderful job in her portrayal of Krazner.  She affects a rather unique Brooklyn accent that I was addicted to listening to.  And she shows heaps of spunk and energy, especially in her early scenes where she has to fill up the spaces left by Pollock's shyness, while trying to seduce him.  Later scenes, where the dueling couple is forced to yell at each other ad infinitum, are handled well when they could have degenerated into tedium.  Harden is Harris' equal, and she had to be or the movie would not have worked as well as it did.The rest of the cast is peppered with famous faces that don't get to do much.  Val Kilmer, John Heard, supermodel Stephanie Seymour (huh?) and Jennifer Connelly show up to fill out the background.  Amy Madigan (a.k.a. Mrs. Ed Harris) chews up tonnes of scenery as benefactor Peggy Guggenheim.

Ed Harris' all-out committment to this project is immediately apparent, but his vision seems filtered through uncolored glasses.  Pollock's motivations and reprehensible behavior go unexamined.  It's a literal record of the man's life, but I can get that from a biographic entry in the dictionary.  The elements of the story are these:  Pollock was a painter struggling for artistic identity.  Pollock was also an introverted, inarticulate alcoholic bully.  He didn't even have the guts to be a bully on his own.  He seemed to relish his drinking binges as an excuse to abuse his women.  Then one day he spills some paint and ""discovers"" his style.  The art world, stifling in repetitive excess and yearning for a new hero to give it renewed legitimacy, declares Pollock a genius and away we go.  Now, as The Anointed One with the world kissing his tuchus, Pollock becomes a self-centered bully cubed.  You want to reach into the screen and backhand this guy, partially due to the repetitively odious nature of the man and partially out of boredom.  Yes, its a competent chronicle of Pollock's life but its not very good storytelling.  There's more to directing than yelling ""Action"" and ""Cut.""

Tucker ""subversive snot""","[5, 5]","Having been a fan of Jackson Pollock for many years, I was looking forward to seeing this film but prepared for a slightly over-blown biography.  Much to my suprise, this film was intense, thought provoking and visually amazing from start to finish.This movie grabs a hold of you at the very beginning and although you expect the &quot;tortured-artist angle&quot; for some reason, it doesn't become cliche in this film.  You are taken on a journey of Jackson Pollock's rise to fame and ultimate self destruction.  It is truly fascinating to watch his paintings, character and relationships evolve throughout the years.  It is interesting that his technique changes and art content almost mirror his personal life. I have always wondered how his &quot;splatter technique&quot; came to be and with this film you get an absolute sense of how it was possible for him to get to this level.I was also pleasantly suprised to see how much time and energy was focused on his relationship with his wife, Lee Krasner who in her own right is a great American artist.Ed Harris does a superb job in both the title role and as director.  The entire cast does an exceptional job and in my opinion, should have received more attention than it did from both the critics and the academy.There is the typical artist+alcohol+women=tragedy storyline but it is kept within reason as far as I am concerned giving you enough information to understand the artist for who he was, addictions and all without becoming melodramatic.I am not well versed on Jackson Pollocks life and am not sure how much artistic license was taken in creating the story, however, it seems that everyone involved with this film took great care to get the story right..again, not flashy and melodramtic just real life. It is very apparent that Ed Harris reserched this and took his time in order to get it &quot;just right&quot;.  Which is exactly what he did.Overall this is an excellent representation of an American Icon who does not get the credit he deserves in the Art World.

(Unfortunately I could not get the ""Special Features"" on my DVD to play and these contained comments by Harris.)  But I immediately sensed that he must have had a deep personal involvement in the character in order to turn out such a loving film.I'm not saying that he spares showing the dark side of Pollock or that he excuses his often wretched behavior. But the devotion he must have had to the subject matter really comes across in so many ways.  I read here that he studied painting for 10 years in order to do this film.  Is that true?  Well, when I watched it I was amazed at how beautifully he handled the paint.  I felt like I was watching a master.  He is a very strong and graceful man and it seemed almost like a dance when he dripped and threw the paint on the canvases.As others have mentioned the cast is superb, with Marcia Gay Harden matching Ed Harris' strong performance. Although I've seen her a number of films where she seemed to be Marcia Gay Harden rather than the character, here she totally melted into the personality of Lee Krasner.  (I found myself being very happy to read the ""Afterword"" which explained that Krasner outlived Pollock for many years and managed his estate and also found the time to develop her own work.  Yea!  She really deserved it!)I'm not sure why I didn't give this five stars.  Maybe, as others have mentioned, it was the lack of understanding of the origins of Pollock's mental instability, especially in light of what looked like an exceptionally warm and loving family.  Maybe it was the imbalance between the drunken self-destructive scenes and the good times, with the down times claiming a lot more screen time than the happy ones, that made it too grim.  Maybe it was just the pain of watching  this really beautiful hurting himself and others over and over.I would have enjoyed more scenes of the interactions between the other famous artists of the time, which seemed to be a source of ""juice"" for him.

This movie is good not only because Harris gave an inspired performance, but also because he both nailed Pollock and exemplified the times that were American Abstract Expressionism.  You must remember that Peggy Guggenheim and Pollock are the pair that made Modern American Art credible, which before them (patron and artist), modern art was European, and Americans were ""unimportant.""Action Painting is the genre that Pollock worked in.  The feeling for it is born inside the viewer (ideally) who must associate with the patterns, colors, and detail, or it's all garbage.  You relate your real life to the reality of the forms in the painting.  Think of Ultra Conservative vs. Radical (in an attempt to use a common model).  Polarizing . . . huh?  For instance, when you view works of John Singer Sargent, you may think of someone you know who is particularly aristocratic or authoritative, or Rembrandt, someone who is sage and avuncular.  These works align beauty with convention.  Your feelings are rarely mixed.  Instead, Pollock's work is polarizing, for you see either something you viscerally understand (perhaps regrettably) or simply stupid, confusing lines, blobs, and a mess.  You may both love and hate (fear) abstract art at once.  This is what I mean by polarizing: your mixed emotions will be in extremes.To me, Pollock is visceral.  For years, action painting horrified me, when I could only understand Rembrandt, Rubens, or Boucher, etc.  Then life happened to me, and I finally realized that life doesn't have to be a perfect and pretty picture to be loved.  It's your visceral remembrance (erudition) that forms who you really are.  Compare Pollock's work LUCIFER (1947).  This painting is the definition of what I'm talking about.  Then, it's true that from Impressionism on, patrons have to be a little ""abstract"" themselves, or you'll never get it, or even need to.  There will always be Rembrandt.Harris's story gives insight enough into how Pollock became rich and famous, and deeply tortured.  Lastly, he confessed more than once, by the end, that he felt like a fraud, especially when he ran out of ideas . . . .",5,He he he he he . . . ha ha ha.

Harris could retire tomorrow, and this one film would assure him a place as one of the great actors and directors of our time.It's a movie about an artist, and it's a movie about a drunk.  The drunk and the artist happen to be the same man, and the movie doesn't make the mistake of equating the one with the other.  Many drunks (who also claim--sometime correctly, sometimes not--to be writers or artists) blame their &quot;higher sensibility and/or sensitivity&quot; to the rest of the world on their drunkenness, when in reality they're likely just plain ill.  Stephen King talks about this misinterpretation of alcoholism in his book On Writing.Much of the emotional impact of the movie stems directly from Pollock's struggle with his inner demons, and the struggle of his friends and family with those same demons.  I didn't walk away from this movie with respect for Pollock as a man, although I'm sympathetic to his illness.  I certainly left the movie with a respect for him as a man dedicated to his art, and an enormous amount of respect for his apparently long-suffering wife and her devotion to both the man and his art.This is a movie worth owning, worth savoring with repeated viewings, and worth sharing with friends who might not have already seen it.",5,Wow,1003536000,"10 20, 2001",2001,1357,"['do', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'performance', 'anyone', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Pollock', 'Harris', 'could', 'retire', 'tomorrow', 'one', 'film', 'would', 'assure', 'place', 'one', 'great', 'actors', 'directors', 'time.It', 'movie', 'artist', 'movie', 'drunk', 'drunk', 'artist', 'happen', 'be', 'same', 'man', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'equating', 'one', 'other', 'Many', 'drunks', 'who', 'also', 'claim', 'sometime', 'correctly', 'sometimes', 'not', 'be', 'writers', 'artists', 'blame', 'quot', 'higher', 'sensibility', 'sensitivity', 'quot', 'rest', 'world', 'drunkenness', 'when', 'reality', ""'re"", 'likely', 'just', 'plain', 'ill.', 'Stephen', 'King', 'talks', 'misinterpretation', 'alcoholism', 'book', 'Writing.Much', 'emotional', 'impact', 'movie', 'directly', 'Pollock', 'struggle', 'inner', 'demons', 'struggle', 'friends', 'family', 'same', 'demons', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'respect', 'Pollock', 'man', ""'m"", 'sympathetic', 'illness', 'certainly', 'left', 'movie', 'respect', 'man', 'dedicated', 'art', 'enormous', 'amount', 'respect', 'apparently', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'devotion', 'man', 'art.This', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', 'worth', 'savoring', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'worth', 'sharing', 'friends', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'already', 'seen']",Pollock
662196,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005KHJJ,Reviewer,"[16, 17]","The romantic notion of suffering for one's art has been cinematically rendered in countless films, depicting the lives of real life artists ranging from Van Gogh to Camille Claudel to Beethoven to Jim Morrison to Rimbaud; but rarely has a film penetrated as deeply as ""Pollock,"" directed by and starring Ed Harris as the abstract painter Jackson Pollock.  The story begins in 1941 and chronicles Pollock's life until the early `50s.  It's a vivid, and at times grim portrait of a true artist struggling for recognition, as well as with the inner demons that plague his soul and are reflected in his art and the way he lives his life.  It is said that the artist ""sees"" the world differently than the average person, which may be true; and it is that unique ""vision"" that sets the artist apart.  And Pollock was no exception to the rule.As romantic as it may sound, the reality of suffering for one's art is just that:  Suffering.  For realizing that vision and bringing it to fruition is more often than not an arduous and tortuous path to tread.  Coalescing the fragments of that vision and transferring that information into reality can be a painful process, and one of the strengths of this film is that it so succinctly conveys that sense of desperation and frustration that are seemingly an intrinsic part of ""creating.""  There's a scene in which Pollock, after having been commissioned to do a mural, sits on the floor of his studio with his back against the wall staring for days on end at the blank canvas stretched across the room, waiting for that spark of inspiration, that sudden moment when what he must do will crystallize in his mind's eye.  It's a powerful, intense scene that allows you to share that creative process with the artist and experience the emotional turmoil of it, as well as the exhilaration of the moment when it all suddenly becomes clear, when the vision is realized.  It's a stunning moment; Pollock's face fills the screen and you actually see it in his eyes, the exact moment of discovery.  And it's absolute magic.As Pollock, Ed Harris gives arguably the best performance of his career; he perfectly captures every emotional level of this complex individual, from the manic highs and lows (exacerbated by alcohol consumption) to the neutral moments in between.  He totally immerses himself in the character, and what surfaces is a thorough and memorable picture of a tortured genius and flawed human being.  It's an astounding piece of work, for which he most certainly should have taken home the Oscar for Best Actor.Marcia Gay Harden received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Lee Krasner, the woman who loved Pollock and devoted herself (even at the expense of her own career as an artist) to the man and his art.  It's a terrific performance, through which Harden brings Lee to life, physically and emotionally.  Her amount of screen time seemingly should have qualified her for a Best Actress nomination, but regardless, her work here is unquestionably deserving of the Oscar.The supporting cast includes Amy Madigan (Peggy Guggenheim), Jennifer Connelly (Ruth), Jeffrey Tambor (Clement), Bud Cort (Howard), John Heard (Tony), Sada Thompson (Stella Pollock) and Val Kilmer (Willem de Kooning).  Harris' triumph with ""Pollock"" does not begin and end with his extraordinary performance, however; though his acting is so exceptional it would be easy to overlook the brilliant job of directing he did with this film.  And it is brilliant.  The way this film is presented is the work of not only a seasoned professional, but of a professional artist with a unique vision of his own.  One of the best films of the year (2000), hopefully it will in the future receive the acclaim of which it is so richly deserving.  Hopefully, as well, Harris will direct again; for it is talent like his, and films like this one, that expand the Cinematic Universe as we know it.",5,Stunning Work By Harris,987292800,"04 15, 2001",2001,3933,"['romantic', 'notion', 'suffering', 'one', 'art', 'been', 'cinematically', 'rendered', 'countless', 'films', 'depicting', 'lives', 'real', 'life', 'artists', 'ranging', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'Camille', 'Claudel', 'Beethoven', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Rimbaud', 'rarely', 'film', 'penetrated', 'as', 'deeply', 'Pollock', 'directed', 'starring', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'abstract', 'painter', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'story', '1941', 'Pollock', 'life', 'early', '50s', 'vivid', 'times', 'grim', 'portrait', 'true', 'artist', 'struggling', 'recognition', 'as', 'well', 'inner', 'demons', 'plague', 'soul', 'are', 'reflected', 'art', 'way', 'life', 'said', 'artist', 'sees', 'world', 'differently', 'average', 'person', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'unique', 'vision', 'artist', 'apart', 'Pollock', 'was', 'exception', 'rule.As', 'romantic', 'may', 'sound', 'reality', 'suffering', 'one', 'art', 'just', 'Suffering', 'realizing', 'vision', 'bringing', 'fruition', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'arduous', 'tortuous', 'path', 'tread', 'Coalescing', 'fragments', 'vision', 'transferring', 'information', 'reality', 'can', 'be', 'painful', 'process', 'one', 'strengths', 'film', 'so', 'succinctly', 'conveys', 'sense', 'desperation', 'frustration', 'are', 'seemingly', 'intrinsic', 'part', 'creating', 'scene', 'Pollock', 'having', 'been', 'commissioned', 'do', 'mural', 'floor', 'studio', 'back', 'wall', 'staring', 'days', 'end', 'blank', 'canvas', 'stretched', 'room', 'waiting', 'spark', 'inspiration', 'sudden', 'moment', 'when', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'will', 'crystallize', 'mind', 'eye', 'powerful', 'intense', 'scene', 'share', 'creative', 'process', 'artist', 'experience', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'as', 'well', 'exhilaration', 'moment', 'when', 'suddenly', 'clear', 'when', 'vision', 'realized', 'stunning', 'moment', 'Pollock', 'face', 'screen', 'actually', 'see', 'eyes', 'exact', 'moment', 'discovery', 'absolute', 'magic.As', 'Pollock', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'perfectly', 'emotional', 'level', 'complex', 'individual', 'manic', 'highs', 'lows', 'exacerbated', 'alcohol', 'consumption', 'neutral', 'moments', 'totally', 'character', 'what', 'surfaces', 'thorough', 'memorable', 'picture', 'tortured', 'genius', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'astounding', 'piece', 'work', 'most', 'certainly', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'home', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor.Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'portrayal', 'Lee', 'Krasner', 'woman', 'who', 'loved', 'Pollock', 'devoted', 'even', 'expense', 'own', 'career', 'artist', 'man', 'art', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Harden', 'Lee', 'life', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'seemingly', 'should', 'have', 'qualified', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'regardless', 'work', 'here', 'unquestionably', 'deserving', 'Oscar.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'Peggy', 'Guggenheim', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Ruth', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Clement', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'Howard', 'John', 'Heard', 'Tony', 'Sada', 'Thompson', 'Stella', 'Pollock', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Willem', 'Kooning', 'Harris', 'triumph', 'Pollock', 'not', 'begin', 'end', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'however', 'acting', 'so', 'exceptional', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'overlook', 'brilliant', 'job', 'directing', 'did', 'film', 'brilliant', 'way', 'film', 'presented', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'seasoned', 'professional', 'professional', 'artist', 'unique', 'vision', 'own', 'One', 'best', 'films', 'year', '2000', 'hopefully', 'will', 'future', 'receive', 'acclaim', 'so', 'richly', 'deserving', 'Hopefully', 'well', 'Harris', 'will', 'direct', 'again', 'talent', 'films', 'one', 'expand', 'Cinematic', 'Universe', 'know']",Pollock
662197,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005KHJJ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Pollock (Ed Harris, 2000)Ed Harris was nominated for an Oscar (for acting, not direction); Marcia Gay Harden won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. That's pretty much all that needs said about this movie; Harris and Harden both turn in career-best roles as Pollock and wife Lee Krasner in this biopic, but the rest of it leads one to wonder what, exactly, Harris the director was trying to get at here.Pollock, whether you get his art or not, was an interesting character. He spent his life battling a self-destructive urge (and finally succumbing to it in a truly remarkable way), and in the space of fifteen years went from nobody to the finest artist in America to nobody again. Depending on the outlook of the director, the last fifteen years of Pollock's life could be presented as a morality tale on The Evils of Drinking(TM), as an odd quirk worth a second glance, or as a criticism of the fickleness of the art scene in general. Anyone who's watched more than ten films over the span of his life could come up with a list of perfect directors to present the material in any of these modes and bring it off well, but Harris never quite holds onto any of them long enough to show us what path he's trying to take. Thus, when compared to other biopics about artists (most notably Schnabel's _Basquiat_), Pollock looks unfocused and unsure of itself. That forces the viewer to spend more time thinking about the acting skills of Harris and Harden, but it makes the film as a whole less enjoyable.Worth watching if you enjoy biopics, but not one to go out of your way for. ** 1/2",3,Could have been genius with a better director,1008115200,"12 12, 2001",2001,1586,"['Pollock', 'Ed', 'Harris', '2000', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'acting', 'not', 'direction', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'pretty', 'much', 'said', 'movie', 'Harris', 'Harden', 'turn', 'career-best', 'roles', 'Pollock', 'wife', 'Lee', 'Krasner', 'biopic', 'rest', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'exactly', 'Harris', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'here.Pollock', 'get', 'art', 'not', 'was', 'interesting', 'character', 'spent', 'life', 'battling', 'self-destructive', 'urge', 'finally', 'succumbing', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'way', 'space', 'fifteen', 'years', 'went', 'nobody', 'finest', 'artist', 'America', 'nobody', 'again', 'Depending', 'outlook', 'director', 'last', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Pollock', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'presented', 'morality', 'tale', 'Evils', 'Drinking', 'TM', 'odd', 'quirk', 'second', 'glance', 'criticism', 'fickleness', 'art', 'scene', 'general', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'more', 'ten', 'films', 'span', 'life', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'list', 'perfect', 'directors', 'present', 'material', 'modes', 'bring', 'off', 'well', 'Harris', 'never', 'quite', 'long', 'enough', 'show', 'trying', 'take', 'Thus', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'biopics', 'artists', 'most', 'notably', 'Schnabel', '_Basquiat_', 'Pollock', 'unfocused', 'unsure', 'viewer', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'thinking', 'acting', 'skills', 'Harris', 'Harden', 'film', 'whole', 'less', 'enjoyable.Worth', 'watching', 'enjoy', 'biopics', 'not', 'one', 'go', 'way', '**', '1/2']",Pollock
662198,A361LE16VBQDP8,B00005KHJJ,Robert Bezimienny,"[11, 22]","Even positive reviews of this film hint at dissatisfactions without necessarily articulating them.  For me, there were several problems.*The first was the failure of the film to go beyond the commonly publicised persona of Jackson Pollock;  the excessive alcohol use, mental instability, and of course the feting by the art establishment and the popular media are all well documented here, but then such is the case elsewhere too;  the depiction of the artist's painting technique is also available in the original documentaries made about him - for the film to achieve real greatness, I think it needed to provide insights beyond a surface accuracy of events.  Ed Harris obviously has been fascinated by Jackson Pollock, has researched him thoroughly, and feels some special connection, but it's not so clear whether he has understood him, whether he has fathomed him deeply enough to illuminate the man from within.*The second main problem has some bearing on the first.  The visual art world itself is not presented with much depth.  Clement Greenberg and Peggy Guggenheim are amusing caricatures, but beyond the amusing cliches there is little or no exploration of their deeper motivations - watching this film I don't see how a viewer could begin to understand the place of the visual arts within the broader culture.  Why did modern art matter as much as it did in this period of history?  Not an easy question, and not one likely to yield an easy answer, certainly not an answer readily translated to the medium of film, admittedly.  Still, it would make me feel more involved with the film if I felt that someone, somewhere had been wrestling with both the question and potential answers.  Instead there is the horrible suspicion that the artist is broadly equated with a sports star, or perhaps a movie star, and that the motivation primarily implied in his life is a thirst for fame, fortune, and beating the next guy, winning the race - that such a motivation existed is not in doubt (source material, such as letters to his brother verifies this), but it is shallow to single it out as the prime motivation.  What motivated Pollock to choose the visual arts above all else?  Where did his inspiration originate?  Again, difficult questions, but less well publicised facts might have shone light here - for instance, watching the film you would be hard pressed to know that Pollock's brother was also initially an aspiring artist, and that he had supported Jackson both financially and emotionally in an amazing way;  furthermore, it's hard to appreciate the crucial agonistic relationship Pollock had to Picasso's work.*The scene in which Pollock 'discovers' his drip technique, or action painting, showcases the limitations of the film as a whole.  The 'climactic' nature of the scene is foreshadowed by a slow build-up, and chased along by manipulative, and frankly rather irritating, music.  The volume levels increase, the 'action' in terms of Pollock 'dancing' around his canvas, the rapidity of cuts and the multiplicity of camera angles, all conspire to leave you in no doubt that you have witnessed a pivotal moment in the film.  All this would be fine if you were watching a baseball player hitting a winning home run in the deciding game of the series, but it seems to be far too easy a take on the less spectator orientated process of creating art of lasting value.

662199,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005KHJJ,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","It is easy to see how Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden managed to receive Oscar attention despite this being a non-box office film. Harris is one of the most dependable and versatile actors in Hollywood. He is always first rate in all his performances, and is one of those rare actors who can play drama or comedy, action or suspense. He can be a despicable villain, or a hero. But despite his impressive acting resume, this performance is the highpoint of his career. Harris is always good, but he has never been this good before. There are times he is so convincing in his role that it is a little creepy.Marcia Gay Harden, on the other hand, despite a brilliant beginning to her screen career in the Coen Brothers MILLER'S CROSSING, has been somewhat hidden for the past decade (though she has been in several films since this film was released). POLLOCK demonstrates that this has been our great loss. She nails perfectly her role as Pollock's wife, lover, mother, friend, therapist, fellow artist, and greatest fan and promoter. I must say, however, that I am somewhat perplexed by her winning the Oscar. It isn't that her performance wasn't good enough, but her role in this movie just doesn't seem to fit the Best Supporting Actress category. I think she should have been nominated in the Best Actress category instead.In addition to Harris and Harden, this film was dominated by canvases. Watching Harris work with brush and canvas was a constant delight in this film. I suppose that if you took a magnifying glass to Pollock's canvases, or if you are an expert on his paintings, you could uncover a host of painting errors in the film, but to my eye this was easily the most convincing performance by an actor as a painter actually engaged in the act of painting that I know.Most of the movies I see set in the forties and fifties seem oddly glamorized and stylized. But this film's forties and fifties are intensely realistic. The art direction was subtle yet superb. I especially enjoyed a small scene where Pollock goes grocery shopping in the small town near his new Long Island house. The products on the shelves were just perfect. I really did feel that I was gaining a glimpse into the world of my parents.I don't think this is quite a 5 Star film for one reason: like Pollock's paintings themselves, which at the urging of Clement Greenberg (marvelously portrayed by Jeffrey Tambor--Greenberg, one of the greatest art critics of the past half century, was both Pollock's most intelligent advocate and perceptive critic) were all about surface, the film is only about the surface of Pollock's life. His inner demons exploded onto the surface of his life, but where did those demons come from? Why was he so painfully shy? Why was he driven to drink so much all his adult life? From what did his erratic behavior stem (such as his bizarre Gene Krupa-like drumming on his food upon learning that his brother was moving to Connecticut)? Unless it was the intention of the filmmakers to stay on the surface of Pollock's life in analogy to his paintings, these are questions that needed answers. Contrast this to the incredible and tragically neglected film THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD, about the relationship in the 1930s between a Texas school teacher (marvelously portrayed by a pre-JERRY McGUIRE Renee Zellweger) and pulp fiction writer and creator of Conan the Barbarian Robert E. Howard (Vincent D'Onofrio, in a performance fully as powerful as Harris's in this film). In this film, we also have a character who is a victim of inner turmoil, but unlike POLLOCK, the film provides a wide range of suggestions as to why Howard behaves in the ways that he does.But, while this film may stay on the surfaces, as did Pollock with his canvases, at least in both instances they are brilliant surfaces.",4,"Extraordinary performances, Superb Period Feel",996624000,"08 1, 2001",2001,3803,"['easy', 'see', 'how', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'managed', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'attention', 'being', 'non-box', 'office', 'film', 'Harris', 'one', 'most', 'dependable', 'versatile', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'one', 'rare', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'drama', 'comedy', 'action', 'suspense', 'can', 'be', 'despicable', 'villain', 'hero', 'impressive', 'acting', 'resume', 'performance', 'highpoint', 'career', 'Harris', 'always', 'good', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'before', 'are', 'times', 'so', 'convincing', 'role', 'little', 'creepy.Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'other', 'hand', 'brilliant', 'beginning', 'screen', 'career', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'MILLER', 'CROSSING', 'been', 'somewhat', 'hidden', 'past', 'decade', 'been', 'several', 'films', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'POLLOCK', 'been', 'great', 'loss', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Pollock', 'wife', 'lover', 'friend', 'therapist', 'fellow', 'artist', 'greatest', 'fan', 'promoter', 'must', 'say', 'however', 'am', 'somewhat', 'perplexed', 'winning', 'Oscar', ""n't"", 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'role', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'category', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'category', 'instead.In', 'addition', 'Harris', 'Harden', 'film', 'was', 'dominated', 'canvases', 'Watching', 'Harris', 'work', 'brush', 'canvas', 'was', 'constant', 'delight', 'film', 'suppose', 'took', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'Pollock', 'canvases', 'are', 'expert', 'paintings', 'could', 'uncover', 'host', 'painting', 'errors', 'film', 'eye', 'was', 'easily', 'most', 'convincing', 'performance', 'actor', 'painter', 'actually', 'engaged', 'act', 'painting', 'know.Most', 'movies', 'see', 'set', 'forties', 'fifties', 'seem', 'oddly', 'glamorized', 'stylized', 'film', 'forties', 'fifties', 'are', 'intensely', 'realistic', 'art', 'direction', 'was', 'subtle', 'yet', 'superb', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'small', 'scene', 'where', 'Pollock', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'small', 'town', 'new', 'Long', 'Island', 'house', 'products', 'shelves', 'were', 'just', 'perfect', 'really', 'did', 'feel', 'was', 'gaining', 'glimpse', 'world', 'parents.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', '5', 'Star', 'film', 'one', 'reason', 'Pollock', 'paintings', 'urging', 'Clement', 'Greenberg', 'marvelously', 'portrayed', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Greenberg', 'one', 'greatest', 'art', 'critics', 'past', 'half', 'century', 'was', 'Pollock', 'most', 'intelligent', 'advocate', 'perceptive', 'critic', 'were', 'surface', 'film', 'only', 'surface', 'Pollock', 'life', 'inner', 'demons', 'exploded', 'surface', 'life', 'where', 'did', 'demons', 'come', 'Why', 'was', 'so', 'painfully', 'shy', 'Why', 'was', 'drink', 'so', 'much', 'adult', 'life', 'what', 'did', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'stem', 'such', 'bizarre', 'Gene', 'Krupa-like', 'drumming', 'food', 'learning', 'brother', 'was', 'moving', 'Connecticut', 'was', 'intention', 'filmmakers', 'stay', 'surface', 'Pollock', 'life', 'analogy', 'paintings', 'are', 'questions', 'needed', 'answers', 'Contrast', 'incredible', 'tragically', 'neglected', 'film', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'WIDE', 'WORLD', 'relationship', '1930s', 'Texas', 'school', 'teacher', 'marvelously', 'portrayed', 'pre-JERRY', 'McGUIRE', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'writer', 'creator', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'performance', 'fully', 'as', 'powerful', 'Harris', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'character', 'who', 'victim', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'POLLOCK', 'film', 'wide', 'range', 'suggestions', 'why', 'Howard', 'ways', 'film', 'may', 'stay', 'surfaces', 'did', 'Pollock', 'canvases', 'least', 'instances', 'are', 'brilliant', 'surfaces']",Pollock
662200,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005KHJJ,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","***1/2 Although the film doesn't exactly startle us with its thesis - that the life of an artist is rarely a happy one - ""Pollock"" manages to skirt most of the clich&eacute;s inherent in the ""tortured-artist"" biographical genre to provide us with a complex study not only of the man himself but also of the woman who stood beside him through most of his troubled life.Jackson Pollock was, of course, the prototypical ""struggling genius"" - neurotic, insecure, arrogant, self-absorbed and forever locked in an epic struggle with his own private demons (in Pollock's case, alcoholism).  Out of this morass of personal weaknesses, the painter perfected his art - which became a reflection and synthesis of the raw elements that comprised the emotionally chaotic world in which he lived.  The film introduces us to the man in 1941 when he is still a virtual unknown living in Greenwich Village, bellowing in an alcoholic rage against the success of Picasso, in whose shadow Pollock seems to be forever hidden away from public view.  One day, into his life walks Lee Krasner, a similar, though less gifted, modern artist who detects Pollock's special genius and becomes the future art world celebrity's greatest champion and lover.Much of the fascination of the film lies in the examination of the complexities of the almost love-hate relationship that develops between the two.  On the one hand, we sense that Jackson and Lee provide just the right emotional complement for one another - a shared symbiosis which lays the foundation for an environment in which Pollock's creativity and artistic experimentation can expand and flourish.  Lee, for instance, wages a fierce battle to secure Pollock's acceptance among the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of New York's art world elite, the result of which is eventual name recognition for Pollock the world over.  Yet, Lee pays an ultimate price for her tenacious possessiveness:  so all consumed does she become in the life and work of the man who will change the face of modern art that she begins to alienate him and eventually push him away.  Unwilling to share him even with a child of their own, she ends up depriving Pollock of the chance of experiencing the joys of fatherhood.  The final result is that he is truly left with nothing but his identity as a painter. Thus, as his reputation begins to become eclipsed by newer, younger artists, and as he retreats back into an alcoholic haze after a couple of years of productive sobriety, Pollock's life begins its inevitable spiral downwards into hopelessness and tragedy.Ed Harris not only stars in the film but directed it as well.  He does a superb job on both counts.  As Pollock, he supplies the brooding sensitivity as well as the physical intensity that are reflected in the artist's paintings themselves.  One never doubts the genuine love Pollock has for Lee, yet always there is the constant threat of physical violence lying latent beneath his placid surface.  Marcia Gay Harden matches Harris' performance every step of the way.  Beneath her determined, hard-edged exterior lies a woman capable of sincere attachment and a total devotion to both a person and the cause he represents.Unlike so many films dealing with the lives of artists - in which we see brief glimpses of paint-dabbing followed almost immediately by views of the finished products - ""Pollock"" provides generous opportunities to see Pollock (i.e. Harris) in action.  We sit spellbound as we watch him take a plain white canvas and, step by step, convert it into a work of beauty and art.If for no other reason, the film is worth seeing just to whet one's appetite and renew one's appreciation for Pollock's work.",3,impressive biopic,1004745600,"11 3, 2001",2001,3690,"['film', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'startle', 'thesis', 'life', 'artist', 'rarely', 'happy', 'one', 'Pollock', 'skirt', 'most', 'clich', 'eacute', 'inherent', 'tortured-artist', 'biographical', 'genre', 'provide', 'complex', 'study', 'not', 'only', 'man', 'also', 'woman', 'who', 'stood', 'beside', 'most', 'troubled', 'life.Jackson', 'Pollock', 'was', 'course', 'prototypical', 'struggling', 'genius', 'neurotic', 'insecure', 'arrogant', 'self-absorbed', 'forever', 'locked', 'epic', 'struggle', 'own', 'private', 'demons', 'Pollock', 'case', 'alcoholism', 'morass', 'personal', 'weaknesses', 'painter', 'perfected', 'art', 'became', 'reflection', 'synthesis', 'raw', 'elements', 'comprised', 'emotionally', 'chaotic', 'world', 'lived', 'film', 'man', '1941', 'when', 'still', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'living', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'bellowing', 'alcoholic', 'rage', 'success', 'Picasso', 'shadow', 'Pollock', 'be', 'forever', 'hidden', 'away', 'public', 'view', 'One', 'day', 'life', 'walks', 'Lee', 'Krasner', 'similar', 'though', 'less', 'gifted', 'modern', 'artist', 'who', 'Pollock', 'special', 'genius', 'future', 'art', 'world', 'celebrity', 'greatest', 'champion', 'lover.Much', 'fascination', 'film', 'examination', 'complexities', 'almost', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'two', 'one', 'hand', 'sense', 'Jackson', 'Lee', 'provide', 'just', 'right', 'emotional', 'complement', 'one', 'shared', 'symbiosis', 'foundation', 'environment', 'Pollock', 'creativity', 'artistic', 'experimentation', 'can', 'expand', 'flourish', 'Lee', 'instance', 'fierce', 'battle', 'secure', 'Pollock', 'acceptance', 'cr', 'egrave', 'la', 'cr', 'egrave', 'New', 'York', 'art', 'world', 'elite', 'result', 'eventual', 'name', 'recognition', 'Pollock', 'world', 'Lee', 'ultimate', 'price', 'tenacious', 'possessiveness', 'so', 'consumed', 'become', 'life', 'work', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'change', 'face', 'modern', 'art', 'alienate', 'eventually', 'push', 'away', 'Unwilling', 'share', 'even', 'child', 'own', 'up', 'depriving', 'Pollock', 'chance', 'experiencing', 'joys', 'fatherhood', 'final', 'result', 'truly', 'left', 'nothing', 'identity', 'painter', 'Thus', 'reputation', 'become', 'eclipsed', 'newer', 'younger', 'artists', 'back', 'alcoholic', 'haze', 'couple', 'years', 'productive', 'sobriety', 'Pollock', 'life', 'inevitable', 'spiral', 'downwards', 'hopelessness', 'tragedy.Ed', 'Harris', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'directed', 'as', 'well', 'superb', 'job', 'counts', 'Pollock', 'brooding', 'sensitivity', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'intensity', 'are', 'reflected', 'artist', 'paintings', 'One', 'never', 'genuine', 'love', 'Pollock', 'Lee', 'yet', 'always', 'constant', 'threat', 'physical', 'violence', 'lying', 'latent', 'placid', 'surface', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'matches', 'Harris', 'performance', 'step', 'way', 'determined', 'hard-edged', 'exterior', 'woman', 'capable', 'sincere', 'attachment', 'total', 'devotion', 'person', 'cause', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'dealing', 'lives', 'artists', 'see', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'paint-dabbing', 'followed', 'almost', 'immediately', 'views', 'finished', 'products', 'Pollock', 'generous', 'opportunities', 'see', 'Pollock', 'i.e', 'Harris', 'action', 'sit', 'spellbound', 'watch', 'take', 'plain', 'white', 'canvas', 'step', 'step', 'convert', 'work', 'beauty', 'art.If', 'other', 'reason', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'whet', 'one', 'appetite', 'renew', 'one', 'appreciation', 'Pollock', 'work']",Pollock

I had to wait until it was released on VHS--and it was well worth the wait.POLLOCK is, first and foremost, a biography of famed American painter Jackson Pollock, but it is also an intense study of a man, his unyieldingly supportive wife, and their joint effort to realize his dream.  Her character was one who saw the potential and seized it as much for herself as for the man she loved.  Lee Krasner was a shrewd opportunist who happened to love Jackson Pollock enough to stay with him in spite of years of abuse.  Her reason?  ""I believe in Jackson Pollock"".  When he died she managed his estate for the next three decades and finally had an opportunity to paint the pictures that made her a recognized name in art--as an artist, not Jackson Pollock's wife.One needn't be aware of Pollock's impact on the art world to enjoy the ""real life"" aspect of this touching film.  Marcia Gay Harden gave the best performance of the year with her portrayal of Lee Krasner, Pollock's lifeline and wife.  I simply don't understand why she was only considered a ""supporting actress"" because she was on screen every bit as much as Ed Harris and probably had more lines.  In any case, her Oscar was much deserved.  Harris also delivered a stunning performance of the aloof Jackson Pollock, his alcoholism, womanizing, and inner turmoil that surfaced long before he became a fixture in the art world.I don't know much about Pollock's art--I never paid much attention before I saw this film.

662205,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00005KHJJ,Stephen A. Haines,"[1, 1]","Some years ago, an older generation gleefully watched an hilarious satire of Jackson Pollock's painting methods.  In &quot;Day of the Painter.&quot;  Pollock was portrayed as a con artist [pardon the pun!] who randomly threw paint on a board and foisted the result off on rich buyers.  This farcical depiction of Pollock remained the only valid image of him in the minds of many.  Was splattering paint on canvas truly a new art form, or the light-hearted playing of a man who had no professional training in his craft?Ed Harris has inverted this superficial personification to give us a truer picture of the man who established a new genre of North American painting.  Pollock is a supreme example of what good direction, good acting and a valid story can impart to film.  Harris doesn't strip Pollock down to examine him viscerally, nor does he give way to any &quot;postmodern&quot; ideals of what a film should depict.  Instead, Harris simply portrays Pollock as he was - driven by his art, expressive to extremes and aching for acknowledgment.  In giving us this portrait, Harris carefully avoids judgments of either Pollock or the art form he established.  With quiet intensity, Harris conveys the agonies Pollock suffered, both in his work and life.  It's to Harris' credit that the finest scenes in this film are those of him painting as Pollock did.  Every movement of his body, every facial expression conveys the seriousness Harris gave in this, his pet project, for a decade.Marcia Gay Harden is the deserved winner of her Academy Award for her portrayal of Pollock's wife and colleague.  An artist herself, Krasner was likely one of few women who could have sustained the years of Pollock's struggle.  Her faith in his work comes through with vivid intensity in Harden's role.  Her final break under the years of stress is superbly done by Harden in the near-final scene.In all, this film is a masterpiece of filmmaker's art.  Harris managed the filming with manifest abilities.  Directing himself in the painting scenes is hard to imagine.  His control of every scene is masterful.  He cannot garner enough accolades for his direction of an excellent team.  This is a film to treasure.  Whatever Harris takes on next will inevitably command attention.  One can almost conjure a list of personalities he might deal with in future films.  Will biography become his particularly specialty, or was his submersion into Pollock's personality too great to be duplicated with another figure?",5,But is it art?,1010534400,"01 9, 2002",2002,2497,"['years', 'ago', 'older', 'generation', 'gleefully', 'watched', 'hilarious', 'satire', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'painting', 'methods', 'quot', 'Day', 'Painter.', 'quot', 'Pollock', 'was', 'portrayed', 'con', 'artist', '[', 'pun', ']', 'who', 'threw', 'paint', 'board', 'foisted', 'result', 'rich', 'buyers', 'farcical', 'depiction', 'Pollock', 'remained', 'only', 'valid', 'image', 'minds', 'many', 'Was', 'splattering', 'paint', 'canvas', 'truly', 'new', 'art', 'form', 'light-hearted', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'professional', 'training', 'craft', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'inverted', 'superficial', 'personification', 'give', 'truer', 'picture', 'man', 'who', 'established', 'new', 'genre', 'North', 'American', 'painting', 'Pollock', 'supreme', 'example', 'what', 'good', 'direction', 'good', 'acting', 'valid', 'story', 'can', 'impart', 'film', 'Harris', ""n't"", 'strip', 'Pollock', 'down', 'examine', 'viscerally', 'give', 'way', 'quot', 'postmodern', 'quot', 'ideals', 'what', 'film', 'should', 'depict', 'Instead', 'Harris', 'simply', 'Pollock', 'was', 'driven', 'art', 'expressive', 'extremes', 'aching', 'acknowledgment', 'giving', 'portrait', 'Harris', 'carefully', 'judgments', 'Pollock', 'art', 'form', 'established', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'Harris', 'agonies', 'Pollock', 'suffered', 'work', 'life', 'Harris', 'credit', 'finest', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'painting', 'Pollock', 'did', 'Every', 'movement', 'body', 'facial', 'expression', 'conveys', 'seriousness', 'Harris', 'gave', 'pet', 'project', 'decade.Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'deserved', 'winner', 'Academy', 'Award', 'portrayal', 'Pollock', 'wife', 'colleague', 'artist', 'Krasner', 'was', 'likely', 'one', 'few', 'women', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'sustained', 'years', 'Pollock', 'struggle', 'faith', 'work', 'vivid', 'intensity', 'Harden', 'role', 'final', 'break', 'years', 'stress', 'superbly', 'done', 'Harden', 'near-final', 'scene.In', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'filmmaker', 'art', 'Harris', 'managed', 'filming', 'manifest', 'abilities', 'Directing', 'painting', 'scenes', 'hard', 'imagine', 'control', 'scene', 'masterful', 'can', 'not', 'garner', 'enough', 'accolades', 'direction', 'excellent', 'team', 'film', 'treasure', 'Harris', 'next', 'will', 'inevitably', 'command', 'attention', 'One', 'can', 'almost', 'conjure', 'list', 'personalities', 'might', 'deal', 'future', 'films', 'Will', 'biography', 'become', 'particularly', 'specialty', 'was', 'submersion', 'Pollock', 'personality', 'too', 'great', 'be', 'duplicated', 'figure']",Pollock

662209,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005KHJJ,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Ed Harris gives very compelling acting as Jackson Pollock, legendary American painter, whose life story has been recently followed by the aptly titled book ""Jackson Pollock: an American Saga"" by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith.  Actually, the film is based on this book.So, you may expect to see the artist's stormy lifestory; sure, you will, but the film skips his childhood when living at a farm in Arizona.  It concentrates on drawing the relations between Pollock and his wife Lee Krasner, New Yorker and artist on her own.  Winsome Lee senses something in Jackson's paintings when he was still an unknown, convinced that he has a huge talent to be discovered.  Jackson was often a difficult person to get along with, mainly because of drinking, but Lee helps the struggling artist, even abandoning her career for him.The film traces the ups and downs of their life.  You may feel there are more ""downs"" than ""ups,"" and perhaps you are right.  Any artist's life can be heaven or hell, and the Pollocks' is no exception.You are not allowed to know the reason for Jackson's constant pains, which are manifest all over the film.  You can feel (sometimes self-destructive) energy of his personality and creativity, thanks to Ed Harris's great acting, and Pollock's original way of painting (Dripping paints onto the paper on floor) is convincingly re-created.  But about his bad habit of drinking, you will never know what drove him to act that way.  If Jackson Pollock here is convincing, that is because Ed Harris is convincing, not the script, which tends to be episodic, like that of ""Frida.""But it is excellent Marcia Gay Harden who should be most praised as the driving force of the film.  Her natural and charming acting as Mrs. Pollock will never fail to pull you in, showing the credible portrait of an independent and compassionate woman who understood him.  Don't miss her.Not an easy bio-pic to watch because of its central character, but still the film is compelling owing to the two leading actors.

Harris and Marcia Gay Harden are deeply penetrating, and their performances made it more compelling to watch this slow-paced film.This film chronicles the life and death of America's first internationally-famous modern painter. Harden played Lee Krasner, a fellow artist and girlfriend to Pollock(Harris). She unconditionally supported him and wanted to help him gain recognition and success, even though she had to neglect her own career. Pollock's first show at Peggy Guggenhuiem's gallery was not well received, because people didn't like his style.Krasner and Pollock got married and moved to the country side, there Pollock painted his best ""spatter"" work which ultimately propelled him to international stardom in the art world. At that point, he started to unravel emotionally. He started to lose hold of himself and creativity when Krasner refused to have a baby. Then he started to see another woman(Jennifer Connelly). Krasner couldn't take it anymore and decided to leave him unless he stops seeing her......Marcia Gay Harden gave her most striking performance that was well-worthy of the Oscar she won. She was great in one of the fight scenes with Pollock. It goes like this: She just got out of the bath, and Pollock started to talk to her about making a baby. She gave him a very angry reaction. She shouted at him,""I am not going to bring another life into that! We are painters Pollock, we don't have any money, we don't get by, we struggle! You are a great painter! I believe in Jackson Pollock! There's you and the paintings, you need! you need! you need!......"".That was an incredible scene and she was very mesmerizing.Ed Harris did a great job at directing, acting, and producing of this film. It was a labour of love for him. I was very moved by the scene when he read a letter from Krasner after they had been separated. It was so sad that he was in pieces and nothing meant anything to him anymore. It's admirable that he was welling to put on as much as 30 lbs when his character got very fat from over drinking and eating.As Krasner had said,""You have done it Pollock, you have cracked it wide open!""",4,"There's you and the paintings, You Need, You Need!
