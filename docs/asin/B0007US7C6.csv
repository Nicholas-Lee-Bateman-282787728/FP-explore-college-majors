I love that she has two dads, and based on their personalities, they both love her in different ways. In addition, there's nothing like a guy in uniform who is handsome, intelligent, patriotic, disciplined, caring, humble, family-oriented, etc. Her mum is also wonderful. Cadet Kelly maintains her bond with her old- and new friend, which is fantastic. She rocked as a cadet, and she made me proud to be a female. The regional competitions were amazing! It's a funny film, and it's a great family-oriented film, so I highly recommend it to all.",5,What A Terrific Film,1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,615,"['love', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'father-daughter', 'theme', 'very', 'beautiful', 'love', 'two', 'dads', 'based', 'personalities', 'love', 'different', 'ways', 'addition', 'nothing', 'guy', 'uniform', 'who', 'handsome', 'intelligent', 'patriotic', 'disciplined', 'caring', 'humble', 'family-oriented', 'etc', 'mum', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Cadet', 'Kelly', 'bond', 'old-', 'new', 'friend', 'fantastic', 'rocked', 'cadet', 'made', 'proud', 'be', 'female', 'regional', 'competitions', 'were', 'amazing', 'funny', 'film', 'great', 'family-oriented', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

When her mother re-marries and breaks the news to Kelly - they're moving and she's going to be attending military school at their new location - she is miserble.  But could she be the one to turn military school into a place of fun, fashion, and friends?  Most likely not.  Will she be able to handle the fact that her stepdad is the HEAD of the school?  She's not sure.  And finally, will she be able to turn her stepdad into a ""father"" before the new baby arrives?  As Kelly often says, she has ""to do everything"".This is an entertaining, feel-good sort of movie.  It's definately not worthy of an Academy Award or anything like that, but I like to watch it sometimes whenever it's on the Disney Channel.  Christy Carlson Romano does a great job as the mean ""Captain Stone"", as does Hilary as the funky, fun ""Kelly"".  Overall, this movie is simple, but it's still good.  I recommend it to Hilary Duff and Christy Carlson Romano fans, as well as to girls who love a good tween movie.
