690043,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005YU41,A Customer,"[7, 7]","Heartwrenching.Story summary:Iris Murdoch (Judi Dench - old; and Kate Winslet - young) is a renowned philosopher and author.  The movie intermixes when she first met her husband, John Baylor (Jim Broadbent - old; and Hugh Bonneville - young) and her decline into Alzheimer's.  I don't think it would be accurate to call Iris free-spirited, though in a sense that may actually describe her.  She seems to be more along the lines of explorative.  The movie doesn't tell us a lot about Iris's life before she met John nor much about her life in between meeting John and when she succumbs to Alzheimer's.  Perhaps because of her fame we should already know about her (I am not familiar with her work).  What we are able to pick up is that John was desperately in love with her when they first met and she eventually came to realize that she needed him.  When the Alzheimer's worsens, though John has always loved her, it becomes apparent that they have both become very dependent upon the other.My comments:I loved the movie.  The acting was superb.  Jim Broadbent deserved the Oscar for his performance; the movie is worth seeing just for his portrayal.  All of the others were very good as well.  I think I am still surprised how comfortable Kate Winslet seems with her body (there is full body nudity in the movie, though I wouldn't consider it pornographic).  What really makes this movie wonderful, besides the acting, is the love that you feel between Iris and John (both the old and young).  You feel the loss.  My wife and I are a young couple and thinking about growing old and having to deal with debilitating diseases really makes the devastation of Alzheimer's seem more real.The jumps between the old and young versions of Iris and John made me hesitant at the beginning of the movie that it was going to be hard to follow.  It really wasn't.  Though the story wasn't continuous, I don't think it was intended to be. I also have to comment on their house.  I know, some people like living like that, but wow.  Anyway...Overall, though the movie is sad and, as I described it above, heartwrenching, I would highly recommend it.  Why four instead of five?  I'm not sure that they really could have improved the story other than to give us a bit more information on Iris Murdoch, but I just didn't think it was a five star film.",4,Heartwrenching.

The main story is about the life of John Bayley and his wife Iris Murdoch all through her old age and illness, with juxtaposed flashbacks of their early years punctuating their intellectual courtship and partnership that lasted over forty years. All the actors have done an admirable and convincing job. It is a very different Kate Winslet - who plays the young Iris - from her Titanic days. Perhaps the director has intended not to capitalize on the literary status of Iris Murdoch and wanted to portray Iris and her husband as ordinary people struggling with love, devotion, frustration, and illnesses. But Iris Murdoch was an intellectual with multi-dimensional depths. When Iris passed away, John Bayley wrote: ""She is not sailing into the dark. The voyage is over and, under the dark escort of Alzheimers, she has arrived somewhere."" There seemed to be a lot more to the physical frustration and inconvenience in their struggle against the debilitating disease. It would have been an interesting exploration to see how she would draw strength from classical philosophy, Morality, and Existential ideals when she realized her biggest asset - her mind - was wasting away. The characterization of John Bayley is rather self-deprecating. It is difficult to believe that, among all the eligible suitors, Iris would find Bayley the most appealing. At one point in the movie, Iris says to him: ""You are the one who knows me the most."" It is not clear altogether how this was true. Iris keeps saying no one has read her novels before they were published but offers a manuscript to Bayley. This is hardly convincing as the way that Bayley would learn everything about Iris.",3,Engrossing Love Story,1015632000,"03 9, 2002",2002,1711,"['Iris', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'parts', 'main', 'story', 'life', 'John', 'Bayley', 'wife', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'old', 'age', 'illness', 'juxtaposed', 'flashbacks', 'early', 'years', 'punctuating', 'intellectual', 'courtship', 'partnership', 'lasted', 'forty', 'years', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'admirable', 'convincing', 'job', 'very', 'different', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'young', 'Iris', 'Titanic', 'days', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'intended', 'not', 'capitalize', 'literary', 'status', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'wanted', 'portray', 'Iris', 'husband', 'ordinary', 'people', 'struggling', 'love', 'devotion', 'frustration', 'illnesses', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'was', 'intellectual', 'multi-dimensional', 'depths', 'When', 'Iris', 'passed', 'away', 'John', 'Bayley', 'wrote', 'not', 'sailing', 'dark', 'voyage', 'dark', 'escort', 'Alzheimers', 'arrived', 'somewhere', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'physical', 'frustration', 'inconvenience', 'struggle', 'debilitating', 'disease', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'draw', 'strength', 'classical', 'philosophy', 'Morality', 'Existential', 'ideals', 'when', 'realized', 'biggest', 'asset', 'mind', 'was', 'wasting', 'away', 'characterization', 'John', 'Bayley', 'rather', 'self-deprecating', 'difficult', 'believe', 'eligible', 'suitors', 'Iris', 'would', 'find', 'Bayley', 'most', 'appealing', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'Iris', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'not', 'clear', 'altogether', 'how', 'was', 'true', 'Iris', 'saying', 'one', 'read', 'novels', 'were', 'published', 'manuscript', 'Bayley', 'hardly', 'convincing', 'way', 'Bayley', 'would', 'learn', 'everything', 'Iris']",N/A
690045,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005YU41,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","When you look at the cast, you'll smile, and for good reason.  Kate Winslet is sublimely sweet, charming and spunky.  Judi Dench is effectively solemn, fragile and confused.  Jim Broadbent is perfectly subtle, raw and conflicted.  High Bonneville is delightfully amused, smitten and bewildered.  In fact, every actor is in the right place at the right time doing the right thing.  Winslet especially is sublime, and Broadbent's year was outstanding.  Sadly great acting can't save this film.  What `Iris' has in acting it lacks in overall construction.  Simply put, the film is rather dull.  It feels bland, and that's odd when you consider the film's subject.  Dealing with a real life person with a hugely engaging personality who was crippled by a devastating disease and cared for by her longsuffering husband is a weighty and potentially spellbinding premise, and yet `Iris' doesn't feel all that spellbinding.  Flashing forward and backward between Iris Murdock's vivacious youth and her depressing elderly state, the film's flow is somewhat disjointed in areas, but that isn't the film's main problem.  It just lies flat, missing that spark that would have made it feel profound.  Regardless of the message it was trying to relay (the power of love in a tragic relationship), it doesn't convey the message as emphatically as it needed to.  I admired some of the choices made with regard to the relationship between Iris and her husband, especially with regard to John's character development and the effect his wife's condition had on him (so lovingly bitter), but the film just couldn't get over such a big hurdle.  See it for the performances, especially that of Winslet and Broadbent (who are both superb), but if you are searching for that special something, that emotional impact, then look elsewhere.",3,The acting can't save this film...,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,1813,"['When', 'look', 'cast', ""'ll"", 'smile', 'good', 'reason', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'sublimely', 'sweet', 'charming', 'spunky', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'effectively', 'solemn', 'fragile', 'confused', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'perfectly', 'subtle', 'raw', 'conflicted', 'High', 'Bonneville', 'delightfully', 'amused', 'smitten', 'bewildered', 'fact', 'actor', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Winslet', 'especially', 'sublime', 'Broadbent', 'year', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Sadly', 'great', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'What', 'Iris', 'acting', 'overall', 'construction', 'Simply', 'put', 'film', 'rather', 'dull', 'bland', 'odd', 'when', 'consider', 'film', 'subject', 'Dealing', 'real', 'life', 'person', 'hugely', 'engaging', 'personality', 'who', 'was', 'crippled', 'devastating', 'disease', 'cared', 'longsuffering', 'husband', 'weighty', 'potentially', 'spellbinding', 'premise', 'yet', 'Iris', ""n't"", 'feel', 'spellbinding', 'Flashing', 'forward', 'backward', 'Iris', 'Murdock', 'vivacious', 'youth', 'depressing', 'elderly', 'state', 'film', 'flow', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'areas', ""n't"", 'film', 'main', 'problem', 'just', 'flat', 'missing', 'spark', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'feel', 'profound', 'Regardless', 'message', 'was', 'trying', 'relay', 'power', 'love', 'tragic', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'convey', 'message', 'as', 'emphatically', 'needed', 'admired', 'choices', 'made', 'regard', 'relationship', 'Iris', 'husband', 'especially', 'regard', 'John', 'character', 'development', 'effect', 'wife', 'condition', 'had', 'so', 'lovingly', 'bitter', 'film', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'big', 'hurdle', 'See', 'performances', 'especially', 'Winslet', 'Broadbent', 'who', 'are', 'superb', 'are', 'searching', 'special', 'something', 'emotional', 'impact', 'then', 'look', 'elsewhere']",N/A

Unlike 'The Notebook,' the Iris' retrospective is done without subtrefuge.The quality of the acting ensemble here is almost without equal: Judi Dench, Kate Winslet, the always underrated Jim Broadbent, and Hugh Bonneville (a slightly less known commodity on this side of the ocean, but a great talent in his own right).  One of the neat things in this film is to see the Winslet and Bonneville draw characterizations of the young Iris Murdoch and John Bayley that *run through* Dench and Broadbent.

But in the end you see how much it means to have someone to support and love you -- mainly when you need.The film tells the story of the British novelist and phlisopher Iris Murdoch. Alternating scenes from the young Iris (Kate Winslet) and the old (Judi Dench) the film shows the most important periods of her relationship with the love of her life John Bayley ( Hugh Bonneville and Jim Broadbent). So we see when they first met and how they develop such a relarionship founded on love, friendship and mutual admiration. And we also see their last days, when the desease dominates Iris' mind.The cast is simply a wonderful. No actor is in the wrong place and the four central actors who plays the couple in different times of their lives are stunning. Kate Winslet once more is brilliant as the young Iris who is beautiful inteligente and fierce. Judi Dench as the older Iris is centred and calm, but still brilliant and the moments when the diseades dominates her mind she is perfect. Jim Broadbent really deserved his Oscar as Iris soul mate. He is the one who helps her to fight the disease, despite the fact it is a lost battle -- as all doctors say.The direction is simple and quite effective. The screenplay may sound confusing at first, but it is not. The writer meant to show how close facts that happen to the young Iris to the old one are.Love can not cure anything, but with this movie we see how it helps when hard times come.

Since Bayley himself wrote the book, it was sometimes hard to get a sense of him apart from his role as an author.  Broadbent and Bonneville really make him come to life.  If Murdoch's goal as a writer was to show &quot;how to be good&quot; and &quot;how to love,&quot; then she learned a lot from Bayley, who appears to be both.My only caution is that if you have not read the book first, you might be a bit thrown by the constant shifting back and forth from the aged Murdoch-and-Bayley to the days of their youth.  (For example, at one point the young Bayley opens a door to peek on Iris but when the camera turns to see what he sees we shift forward several decades and see the aged Iris instead).Definitely worth seeing/renting/buying for the performances.

This incredible woman wrote 26 novels and taught philosophy at Oxford. She also wrote books on philosophy. Yet in her later years she developed Alzheimer's disease and gradually lost contact with reality. John Bayley wrote an account of those years and the painful experiences he had as he saw his vibrant, brilliant, talented wife gradually deteriorate to the point she doesn't know how to open a door or dress herself. Judi Dench plays the deteriorating Iris who forgets what she is saying while being interviewed on national television. Kate Winslet plays the quick minded, creative, experimental Iris in her brilliant youth. Jim Broadbent does an amazing job of playing John Bayley as a young man totally in love with the wild Iris and then again as the old John Bayley loving his wife as she gradually slips away from him. Broadbent is one of the finest actors and even playing with Dench or Winslet he demonstrates what a master he is of his craft.

Yet, &quot;Iris&quot; is about love.  The two issues blend nicely.  The mountains of life with this disease are real for the victim and their families.  Heavy heart and soul was written so powerfully that when sadness booms, the audience cries.  When anger booms, the audience's heart beats in raging speeds.  When happiness booms, the audience's sense of hope arises.Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent are an amazing duo as husband and wife fighting the battle of love and care vs. rage and turbulation.  This is what makes a &quot;disease based&quot; movie so unique.  Dench displicts how such a battle changes one's life like the real-life philosopher.  She is one of few modern actresses who can express such soul in a movie.  Broadbent, in his deserved Oscar winning role, displicts why one needs such hope and why it's important to never surrender.  Kate Winslet shows how such life outlook begins.  As the young Iris, she proves that one doesn't have to have the perfect beginnings to have a near perfect ending.  Winslet was the perfect casting choice as she proves that she'll be a legendary actress within the next few years.

Litton,"[4, 10]","""Iris"" falls into a category of movies I like to call ""Sleeper Weepers,"" meaning you'll either be weeping for the film's main character, who undoubtedly goes through much tribulation and hardship, or you'll be rubbing your eyes open from sheer boredom and listlessness as the movie drones on and one seemingly without end. I was not impressed with the film: it moves at a dreary, lifeless pace that doesn't really peak the interest in its main character, Iris Murdoch, of whom we learn little when we should be learning droves.From the start, we get the feeling that Murdoch's life was one of great achievement; the film's opening scene that introduces Dame Judi Dench as the older version of the British author show her giving a speech about life, education, the mind, etc (Kate Winslet plays the young version). No sooner have we started to get to know Iris as an spunky old lady, than we are transported back in time to her early years, in the years when she first met her future husband, John Bayley (played young by Hugh Bonneville, played old by Jim Broadbent), who is intrigued by her seemingly ageless zest for life.The film does well in casting Dench and Winslet, their performances breathing life into Murdoch in a manner that the film realizes only in glimpses. Dench fills the room with a great presence, while also adding what she can to the emotional strings, as her character begins to fall to the clutches of Alzheimer's disease. Winslet is uniquely charming, full of verve and tenacity. Bonneville portrays the young Bayley with a boyish naivety that makes their delicate relationship even more touching in certain moments, while Broadbent shapes the older, learned man into someone devoted to his love through good times and bad.It's only a shame that these touching moments come as mere glimpses, cast into a canvas that, despite a somewhat short running time, seems endless and ongoing. The movie sees fit to shove symbolism and the elements of loss and love down our throats without abandon, which would work had director Richard Eyre been able to inject some measure of emotional resonance into the proceedings. What we get, in between the interspersed moments of real resonance, is a rather sloppy series of transitions between past and present, those which deaden any feeling we've begun to develop for Murdoch or Bayley.Perhaps the biggest disappointment in ""Iris"" is the lack of overall feeling one gets from watching Murdoch's life unfold in such a wearisome manner. The acting, the small touches of witty humor and real emotion, don't neccessarily go to waste, but they don't receive the full realization they so truly deserve.",2,We learn little when we should be learning droves.,1019347200,"04 21, 2002",2002,2655,"['Iris', 'category', 'movies', 'like', 'call', 'Sleeper', 'Weepers', 'meaning', ""'ll"", 'either', 'be', 'weeping', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'undoubtedly', 'much', 'tribulation', 'hardship', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rubbing', 'eyes', 'open', 'sheer', 'boredom', 'listlessness', 'movie', 'drones', 'one', 'seemingly', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'film', 'dreary', 'lifeless', 'pace', ""n't"", 'really', 'peak', 'interest', 'main', 'character', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'whom', 'learn', 'little', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'learning', 'start', 'get', 'feeling', 'Murdoch', 'life', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'achievement', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'older', 'version', 'British', 'author', 'show', 'giving', 'speech', 'life', 'education', 'mind', 'etc', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'young', 'version', 'sooner', 'have', 'started', 'get', 'know', 'Iris', 'spunky', 'old', 'lady', 'are', 'transported', 'back', 'time', 'early', 'years', 'years', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'future', 'husband', 'John', 'Bayley', 'played', 'young', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'played', 'old', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'who', 'intrigued', 'seemingly', 'ageless', 'zest', 'life.The', 'film', 'well', 'casting', 'Dench', 'Winslet', 'performances', 'breathing', 'life', 'Murdoch', 'manner', 'film', 'only', 'glimpses', 'Dench', 'room', 'great', 'presence', 'also', 'adding', 'what', 'can', 'emotional', 'strings', 'character', 'fall', 'clutches', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'Winslet', 'uniquely', 'charming', 'full', 'verve', 'tenacity', 'Bonneville', 'young', 'Bayley', 'boyish', 'naivety', 'delicate', 'relationship', 'even', 'more', 'touching', 'certain', 'moments', 'Broadbent', 'older', 'learned', 'man', 'someone', 'devoted', 'love', 'good', 'times', 'bad.It', 'only', 'shame', 'touching', 'moments', 'come', 'mere', 'glimpses', 'cast', 'canvas', 'somewhat', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'endless', 'ongoing', 'movie', 'fit', 'shove', 'symbolism', 'elements', 'loss', 'love', 'down', 'throats', 'abandon', 'would', 'work', 'had', 'director', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'been', 'able', 'inject', 'measure', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'proceedings', 'What', 'get', 'interspersed', 'moments', 'real', 'resonance', 'rather', 'sloppy', 'series', 'transitions', 'past', 'present', 'deaden', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'begun', 'develop', 'Murdoch', 'Bayley.Perhaps', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'Iris', 'lack', 'overall', 'feeling', 'one', 'watching', 'Murdoch', 'life', 'unfold', 'such', 'wearisome', 'manner', 'acting', 'small', 'touches', 'witty', 'humor', 'real', 'emotion', 'do', ""n't"", 'neccessarily', 'go', 'waste', 'do', ""n't"", 'receive', 'full', 'realization', 'so', 'truly', 'deserve']",N/A

There was an Oscar-worthy turn if ever I saw one.Stupid being that I am, I had never heard of Iris Murdoch beyond an ocassional mention of her name. Thus the film fascinated me as a purely biographical work. Naturally, with DAME Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent, one can never go awry, and I truly loved nearly every minute of their work here.However: I feel that too many ""Alzheimer"" films are being made these days--since one powerful film can go a long, long way--and I felt that ""Iris"" got carried away with itself in this part of the film. I asked, What is it? Is it about Alzheimer's Disease or about Iris Murdoch?Somehow the film didn't work for me, in that direction, and I felt it dragged the thing down badly. There is a way of portraying Alzheimer's in film, I believe, that enhances the story and drives the point home--without the horrors being devoured like red meat. It is something I simply cannot stand. Jim Broadbent's (Bayley's) horrible mental breakdown from the strain of caring for his wife is a thing I wish never to see again in any film. And Dame Judi (Iris) urinating in her living room is also excessive and unnecessary.I'd say not to miss this film, but then, as they say in England, I hope you have a strong stomach!",3,The flashback is back,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,1342,"['First', 'off', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'ignore', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'young', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy', 'turn', 'ever', 'saw', 'one.Stupid', 'being', 'am', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'ocassional', 'mention', 'name', 'Thus', 'film', 'fascinated', 'purely', 'biographical', 'work', 'Naturally', 'DAME', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'awry', 'truly', 'loved', 'nearly', 'minute', 'work', 'here.However', 'feel', 'too', 'many', 'Alzheimer', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'days', 'one', 'powerful', 'film', 'can', 'go', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'felt', 'Iris', 'got', 'carried', 'away', 'part', 'film', 'asked', 'What', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'Somehow', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'direction', 'felt', 'dragged', 'thing', 'down', 'badly', 'way', 'portraying', 'Alzheimer', 'film', 'believe', 'story', 'point', 'home', 'horrors', 'being', 'devoured', 'red', 'meat', 'something', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Bayley', 'horrible', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'strain', 'caring', 'wife', 'thing', 'wish', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'film', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Iris', 'urinating', 'living', 'room', 'also', 'excessive', 'unnecessary.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'not', 'miss', 'film', 'then', 'say', 'England', 'hope', 'have', 'strong', 'stomach']",N/A

690072,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,B00005YU41,"""eurotrashgirl""","[8, 8]","Kate Winslet and Judi Dench both do wondrously in this film about the British novelist Iris Murdoch, the noted writer who late in life faced the ravages of Alzheimers disease, and with it the slow and sorrowful withering of her once brilliant intellect.Winslet as the younger Iris absolutely shines.. her freedom of self, her strong and vibrant personality, her utter love affair with life all come through to the viewer, clear and bright. In turn, Dench's acting truly inhabits the character of Murdoch, as she slowly loses touch with the world around her, with the thoughts that had once come so quickly and effortlessly and creatively.Broadbent shines here too, as Murdoch's husband, the writer John Bayley (who himself had only good things to say about the film, upon its release). Broadbent won the Best Supporting actor Oscar for his performance here as the patient yet all too human husband, content with a life somewhat in the sidelines, of watching the brilliant light of his wife shine on him, standing by her during her youthful indiscretions and all along their lives together until her Alzheimers began to invade their lives like an unwanted guest overstaying its welcome. As their house grows more and more messy, disheveled, confused, and their lives more and more removed from those they had once known, of intellectual examination and full-hearted vigor, Bayley remains noble in his love for Iris, loving her faithfully until the end, despite the occasional outpouring of sadness and even anger that his beloved has to endure such undue suffering. In fact, what is most touching here is the fact that though the two once shared all, experiences, thoughts, themselves together and alone, as only those who co-habitate for decades can do, this passage was one which they would both experience so differently, both utterly alone in their experience for the first time since they met, even though physically near each other. (Murdoch, in one of her moments of clarity, seemed to show she understood what was happening to her, but these moments didn't last long, and the darkness soon enveloped her more fully). I think this was the most tragic part of the film, seeing Broadbent/Bayley try to come to terms with not being able to cope with her illness together in any sort of real sense as she slipped away from him. He had to be her anchor and rock, and had no one doing the same for him, as he guided her through her last days.The scenes of the young duo here, on bicycles, and swimming in the British summer sun, are truly beautiful, and will stay with the viewer long after the credits start to roll.. this is one of those rare love stories, imperfect, true, painful at times also, but rarer still is that it was real, and that it lasted through a lifetime of ups and downs, triumphs and sorrows, even throughout illness, and never faded away. Indeed one could say it grew stronger through the rainy days, and changed, as real and true love so often can... As Bayley became more of a parent and less of a lover/husband, his love shone on in a different way, and the comfort he gave to his wife, who needed it so very much, was immeasurable.I recommend this film to fans of Murdoch, Winslet and Dench, and to those in the mood to see a lovingly crafted portrait of lovingly crafted lives. 5 stars.",5,Winslet & Dench shine in this moving film about Iris Murdoch,1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,3313,"['Kate', 'Winslet', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'do', 'wondrously', 'film', 'British', 'novelist', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'noted', 'writer', 'who', 'late', 'life', 'faced', 'ravages', 'Alzheimers', 'disease', 'slow', 'sorrowful', 'withering', 'once', 'brilliant', 'intellect.Winslet', 'younger', 'Iris', 'absolutely', 'shines..', 'freedom', 'self', 'strong', 'vibrant', 'personality', 'utter', 'love', 'affair', 'life', 'come', 'viewer', 'clear', 'bright', 'turn', 'Dench', 'acting', 'truly', 'character', 'Murdoch', 'loses', 'touch', 'world', 'thoughts', 'had', 'once', 'come', 'so', 'quickly', 'effortlessly', 'creatively.Broadbent', 'shines', 'here', 'too', 'Murdoch', 'husband', 'writer', 'John', 'Bayley', 'who', 'had', 'only', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'film', 'release', 'Broadbent', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'here', 'patient', 'yet', 'too', 'human', 'husband', 'content', 'life', 'somewhat', 'sidelines', 'watching', 'brilliant', 'light', 'wife', 'shine', 'standing', 'youthful', 'indiscretions', 'lives', 'together', 'Alzheimers', 'began', 'invade', 'lives', 'unwanted', 'guest', 'overstaying', 'welcome', 'house', 'more', 'more', 'messy', 'disheveled', 'confused', 'lives', 'more', 'more', 'removed', 'had', 'once', 'known', 'intellectual', 'examination', 'full-hearted', 'vigor', 'Bayley', 'noble', 'love', 'Iris', 'loving', 'faithfully', 'end', 'occasional', 'outpouring', 'sadness', 'even', 'anger', 'beloved', 'endure', 'such', 'undue', 'suffering', 'fact', 'what', 'most', 'touching', 'here', 'fact', 'two', 'once', 'shared', 'experiences', 'thoughts', 'together', 'alone', 'only', 'who', 'co-habitate', 'decades', 'can', 'do', 'passage', 'was', 'one', 'would', 'experience', 'so', 'differently', 'utterly', 'alone', 'experience', 'first', 'time', 'met', 'even', 'physically', 'other', 'Murdoch', 'one', 'moments', 'clarity', 'seemed', 'show', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'darkness', 'soon', 'enveloped', 'more', 'fully', 'think', 'was', 'most', 'tragic', 'part', 'film', 'seeing', 'Broadbent/Bayley', 'try', 'come', 'terms', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'cope', 'illness', 'together', 'sort', 'real', 'sense', 'slipped', 'away', 'had', 'be', 'anchor', 'rock', 'had', 'one', 'doing', 'same', 'guided', 'last', 'days.The', 'scenes', 'young', 'duo', 'here', 'bicycles', 'swimming', 'British', 'summer', 'sun', 'are', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'will', 'stay', 'viewer', 'long', 'credits', 'start', 'roll..', 'one', 'rare', 'love', 'stories', 'imperfect', 'true', 'painful', 'times', 'also', 'rarer', 'still', 'was', 'real', 'lasted', 'lifetime', 'ups', 'downs', 'triumphs', 'sorrows', 'even', 'illness', 'never', 'faded', 'away', 'Indeed', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'grew', 'stronger', 'rainy', 'days', 'changed', 'real', 'true', 'love', 'so', 'often', 'can', 'Bayley', 'became', 'more', 'parent', 'less', 'lover/husband', 'love', 'shone', 'different', 'way', 'comfort', 'gave', 'wife', 'who', 'needed', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'immeasurable.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'Murdoch', 'Winslet', 'Dench', 'mood', 'see', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'portrait', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'lives', '5', 'stars']",N/A

However, my decision to ignore literature of probably better quality than I usually choose does not detract from my admiration for the film IRIS, with the title role played by Dame Judi Dench.Murdoch died in 1999 of Alzheimer's Disease, and IRIS is a poignant and sad chronicle of her descent into mental darkness. (Also currently in theaters is the magnificent film A BEAUTIFUL MIND, starring Russell Crowe, which showcases schizophrenia. It's been a good year for mental maladies.) The tragedy of the IRIS story is emphasized by the heavy use of flashbacks, in which a young and free-spirited Murdoch, played effectively by Kate Winslet, is compared to the aging and deteriorating version portrayed by Dame Judi. Indeed, one of the most notable aspects of the production is the casting, which impressively manages to present to the audience both ""young"" and ""old"" versions of both Murdoch and her husband, John Bayley, that actually resemble each other. (I admit, a lot of the credit must likely go to the studio's Makeup Department, but still ...) The ""young"" Bayley is depicted by Hugh Bonneville, and the ""old"" version by Jim Broadbent. Bonneville is absolutely superb - a Best Supporting Actor Oscar is due - as the stammering, awkward, virginal and painfully shy 29-year old geek that wins the heart of young Iris. (This provides evidence, I guess, that even the Nerdy Guy sometimes get the Most Popular Girl.)In an earlier review of 2001's THE SHIPPING NEWS, I remarked that Dench's competent performance in that film wasn't anything exceptional considering her great talent. On the other hand, her portrayal of the elderly and mentally decomposing Murdoch in IRIS is perhaps the greatest role I've ever seen her perform.

690081,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00005YU41,Josh Hitchens,"[5, 5]","""Iris"" is one of the best movies that I have seen. It is also one of the hardest to watch. It is exquisitely made. Written and directed beautifully by Richard Eyre, who got career best performances from Judi Dench, Jim Broadbent, Kate Winslet (all three were nominated for Oscars) and newcomer Hugh Bonneville. But because it deals with the systematic destruction of a brilliant mind by Alzheimer's Disease, it is not easy to sit through. But it's worth it. The movie keeps from being a complete downer because it is ultimately a celebration of an extraordinary life and a tale of unconditional love.Iris Murdoch was a brilliant woman, a novelist and philosopher whose insight into the human condition distinguished her from her peers. ""Iris"" dramatizes two periods of Murdoch's life, which are cleverly juxtapozed. We see the young Iris (Kate Winslet) as a promiscuous student falling in love with the meek John Bayley (Hugh Bonneville). They are an unlikely match. Iris is a woman wildly ahead of her time while John is shy and somewhat befuddled. We also see the older Iris (Judi Dench) as she is diagnosed with Alzheimer's and view her slow and inevitable decline. If the film elected to tell Iris's life story in chronocological order, it would be unbearable to watch. This way, the tragedy is easier to take.Judi Dench outdoes herself here. She makes Iris's cruel destruction by Alzheimer's so believable that we stop being aware of a great actress inhabiting a part and see a real human being slowly falling to pieces. At first Iris forgets the meanings of words like ""puzzled,"" and finds her latest book more difficult to write then the others. Soon this genius of a writer is gone, and in her body is a childlike presence wandering aimlessly through her house muttering incoherently about the mailman. What makes Dench's performance so moving are the moments when Iris has moments of clarity, such as when she is nearly hit by a car, looks up at her husband's face and says ""I love you."" It makes your heart break. This is an unforgettable performance.As John Bayley, who helplessly watches his wife disappear, Jim Broadbent is equally outstanding. He deservedly won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his work. John has always depended on Iris, and now is forced into the role of caretaker. He is both angry, frightened, and devestated by what she has become. You can hear the decades of love and tenderness in his voice when he tells Iris ""darling clever cat, you wrote books,"" when she remembers she was once a writer. Hugh Bonneville, as the young John hopelessly smitten with the incandescent Iris, is just as affecting.Kate Winslet disappears into the role of young Iris just as completely as Judi Dench, and in doing so delivers some of her best work so far. Winslet makes Iris wild and impulsive, with a deep understanding of the world and a special gift for living life to its full possibility. When she tells John Bayley that ""you know me better than anyone else on earth, you are my world,"" you can't help but fall in love with her too.""Iris"" is incredibly well made, and its most extraordinary asset is that its quartet of actors is so believable. You don't doubt for a second that Dench and Winslet, Broadbent and Bonneville, are playing the same two characters. And that is only one of this film's many outstanding achievements.",5,A Truly Beautiful Mind,1091836800,"08 7, 2004",2004,3355,"['Iris', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'also', 'one', 'hardest', 'watch', 'exquisitely', 'made', 'Written', 'directed', 'beautifully', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'who', 'got', 'career', 'best', 'performances', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'three', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'systematic', 'destruction', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'not', 'easy', 'sit', 'movie', 'being', 'complete', 'downer', 'ultimately', 'celebration', 'extraordinary', 'life', 'tale', 'unconditional', 'love.Iris', 'Murdoch', 'was', 'brilliant', 'woman', 'novelist', 'philosopher', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'distinguished', 'peers', 'Iris', 'two', 'periods', 'Murdoch', 'life', 'are', 'cleverly', 'juxtapozed', 'see', 'young', 'Iris', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'promiscuous', 'student', 'falling', 'love', 'meek', 'John', 'Bayley', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'are', 'unlikely', 'match', 'Iris', 'woman', 'wildly', 'ahead', 'time', 'John', 'shy', 'somewhat', 'befuddled', 'also', 'see', 'older', 'Iris', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'diagnosed', 'Alzheimer', 'view', 'slow', 'inevitable', 'decline', 'film', 'elected', 'tell', 'Iris', 'life', 'story', 'chronocological', 'order', 'would', 'be', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'way', 'tragedy', 'easier', 'take.Judi', 'Dench', 'outdoes', 'here', 'Iris', 'cruel', 'destruction', 'Alzheimer', 'so', 'believable', 'stop', 'being', 'aware', 'great', 'actress', 'inhabiting', 'part', 'see', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'slowly', 'falling', 'pieces', 'first', 'Iris', 'meanings', 'words', 'puzzled', 'latest', 'book', 'more', 'difficult', 'write', 'then', 'others', 'Soon', 'genius', 'writer', 'gone', 'body', 'childlike', 'presence', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'house', 'muttering', 'incoherently', 'mailman', 'What', 'Dench', 'performance', 'so', 'moving', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'Iris', 'moments', 'clarity', 'such', 'when', 'nearly', 'hit', 'car', 'up', 'husband', 'face', 'love', 'heart', 'break', 'unforgettable', 'performance.As', 'John', 'Bayley', 'who', 'helplessly', 'wife', 'disappear', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'equally', 'outstanding', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'work', 'John', 'always', 'depended', 'Iris', 'now', 'forced', 'role', 'caretaker', 'angry', 'frightened', 'devestated', 'what', 'become', 'can', 'hear', 'decades', 'love', 'tenderness', 'voice', 'when', 'Iris', 'darling', 'clever', 'cat', 'wrote', 'books', 'when', 'was', 'once', 'writer', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'young', 'John', 'hopelessly', 'incandescent', 'Iris', 'just', 'affecting.Kate', 'Winslet', 'role', 'young', 'Iris', 'just', 'as', 'completely', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'doing', 'so', 'best', 'work', 'so', 'far', 'Winslet', 'Iris', 'wild', 'impulsive', 'deep', 'understanding', 'world', 'special', 'gift', 'living', 'life', 'full', 'possibility', 'When', 'John', 'Bayley', 'know', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'earth', 'are', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'too', 'Iris', 'incredibly', 'well', 'made', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'asset', 'quartet', 'actors', 'so', 'believable', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'second', 'Dench', 'Winslet', 'Broadbent', 'Bonneville', 'are', 'playing', 'same', 'two', 'characters', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'outstanding', 'achievements']",N/A

The movie is divided in two parts, one placed in the fifties, with Iris played by Kate Winslet and Bayley played by Hugh Boneville (from &quot;Notting Hill&quot;). The other part is placed in the nineties, with Judi Dench as Iris and amazing Jim Broadbent as her husband. Scenes from the two timelines are shown one following the other, but this never leave the viewer confused, because director Richard Eyre was able to relate the scenes from the 50s and the scenes from the 90s in an intelligent way.The movie is very simple, leaving room for the outstanding performances by the four mentioned actors. Boneville and Broadbent are both great as Iris' husband, even to the point of being physically alike. Both are excellent depicting the shy, merry and sometimes naive John Bayley. Judi Dench and Kate Winslet, are competent as ever, playing Iris Murdoch. The director and both actresses do a very effective job in portraiyng Iris' transformation, from a bold, forward young woman (at least for 1950 standards) into a serious, independent and, finally, Alzheimer's afflicted older lady.In short, a movie based in a beautiful, though very sad story: Iris Murdoch'and John Bayley's story, their life together, Iris' passion for words, her desire to write meaningful novels based on her true emotions and life experience.Grade 8.7/10",5,Iris,1050451200,"04 16, 2003",2003,1619,"['One', 'who', 'quot', 'Iris', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'fortunate', 'view', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'great', 'performance', 'four', 'gifted', 'talented', 'actors', 'deep', 'emotive', 'true', 'movie.', 'quot', 'Iris', 'quot', 'irish', 'writer', 'philosopher', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'biography', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'husband', 'John', 'Bayley', 'movie', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'one', 'placed', 'fifties', 'Iris', 'played', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Bayley', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Boneville', 'quot', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'quot', 'other', 'part', 'placed', 'nineties', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Iris', 'amazing', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'husband', 'Scenes', 'two', 'timelines', 'are', 'shown', 'one', 'following', 'other', 'never', 'leave', 'viewer', 'confused', 'director', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'was', 'able', 'relate', 'scenes', '50s', 'scenes', '90s', 'intelligent', 'way.The', 'movie', 'very', 'simple', 'leaving', 'room', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'four', 'mentioned', 'actors', 'Boneville', 'Broadbent', 'are', 'great', 'Iris', 'husband', 'even', 'point', 'being', 'physically', 'alike', 'are', 'excellent', 'depicting', 'shy', 'merry', 'sometimes', 'naive', 'John', 'Bayley', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'are', 'competent', 'ever', 'playing', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'director', 'actresses', 'do', 'very', 'effective', 'job', 'portraiyng', 'Iris', 'transformation', 'bold', 'forward', 'young', 'woman', 'least', '1950', 'standards', 'serious', 'independent', 'finally', 'Alzheimer', 'afflicted', 'older', 'lady.In', 'short', 'movie', 'based', 'beautiful', 'though', 'very', 'sad', 'story', 'Iris', ""Murdoch'and"", 'John', 'Bayley', 'story', 'life', 'together', 'Iris', 'passion', 'words', 'desire', 'write', 'meaningful', 'novels', 'based', 'true', 'emotions', 'life', 'experience.Grade', '8.7/10']",N/A

Ever since I learned that H. L.

Of course the film makes me uncomfortable; it should make anybody uncomfortable to watch a human being's life come undone like this.The screenplay by Richard Eyre and Charles Wood, based on the books ""Iris: A Memory"" and ""Elegy for Iris"" by her husband John Bayley, attempts to convey cinematically what has been lost.  Consequently we cut back and forth between the present, as John (Jim Broadbent) struggles to take care of his beloved Iris (Judi Dench), and disjointed scenes from the past, as young John (Hugh Bonneville) and Iris (Kate Winslet) meet and fall in love.  Sometimes they are brief glimpses, other times extended scenes, combining to provide a disjointed pictures of these two lives.I was surprised that I do not especially remember Iris Murdoch as a novelist; I know that I have never read any of her books.  So my sense of what a great mind was lost is based entirely on what we see of Iris at the top of her game in the film.  Clearly ""Iris"" is a film that presents these lives in fragments and pieces.  We never fully understand why Iris decides to marry Jim; it must have been a superb meeting of the minds, but that is not the sense we get from the film where Jim is pretty much an amiable fuddy duddy.  ""Iris"" is about the end and the beginning of a relationship, with a giant gap in the middle.  Still, this film is about the growing gaps that appeared in the lives of this couple, so it is hard to say such an approach is unjustified.  Again, if ""Iris"" is an unsettling film, then we have to remember that it should be.The acting by the four principles is first rate, although I want to make special mention of Hugh Bonneville because he was the only one of the quartet not to receive an Oscar nomination.  Bonneville does as fine of a creating a younger Broadbent as Kate Winslet does a younger Judi Dench, but apparently that is a thankless job.",4,The destruction of a gifted mind by Alzheimer's disease,1043452800,"01 25, 2003",2003,2409,"['quot', 'Iris', 'quot', 'was', 'most', 'disturbing', 'film', 'watch', 'know', 'exactly', 'why', 'affected', 'so', 'Ever', 'learned', 'H.', 'L.', 'Mencken', 'spent', 'final', 'years', 'life', 'incapacitated', 'stroke', 'made', 'impossible', 'read', 'write', 'remember', 'nouns', 'idea', 'losing', 'mental', 'faculties', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'worst', 'possible', 'fates', 'Similar', 'ground', 'covered', 'quot', 'Iris', 'quot', 'novelist', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'mind', 'marriage', 'life', 'destroyed', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'course', 'film', 'uncomfortable', 'should', 'make', 'anybody', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'human', 'being', 'life', 'come', 'undone', 'this.The', 'screenplay', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'Charles', 'Wood', 'based', 'books', 'Iris', 'Memory', 'Elegy', 'Iris', 'husband', 'John', 'Bayley', 'convey', 'cinematically', 'what', 'been', 'lost', 'Consequently', 'cut', 'back', 'forth', 'present', 'John', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'take', 'care', 'beloved', 'Iris', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'disjointed', 'scenes', 'past', 'young', 'John', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'Iris', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'other', 'times', 'extended', 'scenes', 'combining', 'provide', 'disjointed', 'pictures', 'two', 'lives.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'do', 'not', 'especially', 'remember', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'novelist', 'know', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'sense', 'what', 'great', 'mind', 'was', 'lost', 'based', 'entirely', 'what', 'see', 'Iris', 'top', 'game', 'film', 'Clearly', 'Iris', 'film', 'lives', 'fragments', 'pieces', 'never', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'Iris', 'marry', 'Jim', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'superb', 'meeting', 'minds', 'not', 'sense', 'get', 'film', 'where', 'Jim', 'pretty', 'much', 'amiable', 'fuddy', 'duddy', 'Iris', 'end', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'giant', 'gap', 'middle', 'Still', 'film', 'growing', 'gaps', 'appeared', 'lives', 'couple', 'hard', 'say', 'such', 'approach', 'unjustified', 'Again', 'Iris', 'unsettling', 'film', 'then', 'have', 'remember', 'should', 'be.The', 'acting', 'four', 'principles', 'first', 'rate', 'want', 'make', 'special', 'mention', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'quartet', 'not', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Bonneville', 'fine', 'creating', 'younger', 'Broadbent', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'younger', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'apparently', 'thankless', 'job']",N/A
690094,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005YU41,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 9]","One of my favorite aspects of this film is the superb casting!  Celestia Fox who also cast &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; and &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; does a magnificent job of bringing just the right actors together.  The leads are exquisite.  Judi Dench and Kate Winslet, never previously mistaken as twins, seem remarkably well fit, unified by hairdo and harmonized in temperment.  Jim Broadbent and Hugh Bonneville are so superbly matched that I really wondered if it were the same actor!  Broadbent was superb in both &quot;Topsy Turvy&quot; &amp; &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; but touches us fully as the older John Bayley, fully deserving his Best Supporting Actor Oscar &amp; Golden Globe.  Even the lover/friend Maurice, who as a young man serves lobster and as an old man returns Iris from the grocer's, was played by the father/son team of Samuel and Timothy West &amp; is perfect!  I thought there was a family resemblance, and will have to watch &quot;Howard's End&quot; again to spot Sam.  Even Penelope Wilton who flits briefly on screen as best friend Janet Stone turns in a remarkably deep performance.  I felt a bit sorry for Hugh Bonneville who first came to my attention in &quot;Notting Hill&quot; for not also getting a nomination, because he was delightful as the romanticly naive young John Bayley.  The DVD version is good.  I appreciated the featurette and how director Eyre used Iris' life as a vehicle for telling this amazing love story.  Those expecting a biography will be a tad disappointed; but those wanting a deep and rich film will be elated.  It was also touching to see the film awarded recognition by the Alzheimer's Association.  Murdock's &quot;The Unicorn&quot; is now on my reading stand, which will be the first of hers I've read; so any film that makes me want to discover an author must have been moving.

At the opening of the film, I thought it would be the story of a writer whose trade was words and the catastrophic loss of the facility to use them--in other words about the work and the devastating absence of what it is that makes life worthwhile.But I was mistaken--because what might be the raison d' etre for some--one's creative output- was just the framing device for the lovely and gentle love story that spanned over forty years between Dame Iris Murdoch and her husband, critic and professor of English literature, John Bayley.Bayley was not Murdoch's first, nor her greatest love, but he was her most enduring and devoted--and I almost wish this had been a miniseries because while the sequences of the couple's later life were well developed--I would have loved to see more of their life together beyond the all too fleeting scenes of their courtship that was so brilliantly brought to life by Bonneville and the incandescent Winslet. Both were so charming--he as the inexperienced, intellectual, inhibited stutterer and she as a free spirit--whose  brilliance, physicality and joie de vivre must have lit everyone around her on fire--despite the fact that she was far from being conventionally beautiful.In any case there are scenes that are so intimate and moving as the once leader of the duo becomes as helpless as a small child and the follower takes on the role of the caretaker.  Witnessing young John kissing Iris' hand and then the length of her arm -so courtly and old fashioned-and then as she realizes she must take the initiative in their lovemaking, confess he has always been backward--his brother had to tie his shoelaces until he was seven [!] ; and  old ill Iris, somehow still able to understand she has annoyed John to no end--scratching at the door of the study like a cat  to say she is sorry--or somehow managing to recall the words 'I love you'--after she has caused their car to go off the road -is beyond touching.Beautiful script, casting and performances- not only from the four principles but the actresses [ Juliet Aubrey and Penelope Wilton] who played Iris' best friend Janet with such empathy and compassion, and her erstwhile lover Maurice [ father and son--Timothy and Samuel West ] .

""Iris"" takes us on a journey through a wonderful marriage of two clever minds, a journey which takes one member unfortunately to the thieves' den of Alzheimer's Disease. In a way, I got pretty much the movie I expected at ""Iris""--I knew that Judi Dench and Kate Winslet were both first-rate performers. I didn't know how the movie would be presented, however, with the juxtposition of then with now: We see Iris as a young woman played by Kate, and then Iris as an old woman played by Judi. I think that was a very good idea, because both women got equal time on the screen at pretty much the same time. It also allowed the writer and director to treat things thematically with comparison and contrast right off the bat, rather than the audience's having to recall something from two hours' earlier, if we had instead been given a strictly chronological treatment. I just marvelled at how well the movie was cast, appearance-wise. Young resembled old remarkably, unlike the implausible idea that roundish passionate Kate Winslet in time would ever turn into lean tepid Gloria Stuart back in ""Titanic"" days.There's one especially telling scene, when Jim Broadbent, the husband of Alzheimer-afflicted Judi, finally breaks down and starts screaming and yelling at her in bed, his outburst drawn from the terrible abandonment he feels at the loss of his heretofore brilliant wife. We see the rage that the disease causes in survivors and caregivers, who seem to get nothing back no matter how tender the care they lavish on their loved ones.Unlike ""A Beautiful Mind"", there can be no happy ending at the conclusion of ""Iris""; Alzheimer's is a progressive disease the end stage of which is death. ""Beautiful Mind"" showed triumph through adversity, but that is not possible with every illness. Thus, ""Iris"", though undeniably a well-crafted piece, is tremendously sad.

Iris is no sweet angel of the literary world, but a confrontative liberal progressive willing to explore every part of life she can indulge in.  This proves a quandary for the young John Bayley (played by an amazing look-alike named Hugh Bonneville), whose is rather shy, but hopelessly in love with Iris.

690101,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B00005YU41,Mary Whipple,"[7, 7]","When author/philosopher Iris Murdoch utters these words, she has no way of knowing that Alzheimer's disease will soon rob her of that freedom, leaving her the frustrated shell of who and what she was.  Author of twenty-six books and winner of both the Whitbread and the Booker Prizes, Iris, at the end of her life, was, according to her husband, like ""A very nice three-year-old child.""  The love story of Iris Murdoch, a free-spirited, passionate lover of arts and ideas, and John Bayley, the shy, introverted man who was her anchor in life, dominates this film, celebrating her life, even as Alzheimer's disease robs it of its meaning.Directed by Richard Eyre, who converted John Bayley's book, A Memoir and Elegy for Iris, into the screenplay, the film honors Iris, John Bayley, and the love that survived even Alzheimer's disease.  Judi Dench not only looks like Iris Murdoch, but also endows her with fierce independence, a curiosity about the meaning of life, and a strong will, characteristics which served Iris well, even in her decline.  Jim Broadbent, who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, shows his love for her at the same time that he becomes enormously frustrated at his helplessness in dealing with her decline.Alternating between present and past, director Eyre develops innumerable visual parallels, showing Murdoch as a wild young girl (passionately played by Kate Winslett), uninhibitedly exploring every aspect of life, with Dench repeating similar scenes (such as the swimming scenes) late in life.  The young John Bayley (Hugh Bonneville) plays his role so close in style to Broadbent that except for the obvious age differences, they could well be the same person, both blushing on cue.  These four brilliant actors are completely successful in merging time frames to create two complete characters--Iris Murdoch and John Bayley.The obvious symbolism and deliberate parallels between the early and late lives of Iris and John Bayley will not escape any viewer, making the sad changes in Iris's mind even more agonizing to watch, particularly for anyone who has faced Alzheimer's with a loved one.  As Iris herself observes, ""I feel as if I'm sailing into darkness.""  Beautifully filmed by Roger Pratt, the exteriors, including the water scenes, show the vastness of the world that Iris loved to explore, while the interiors show her claustrophobic confinement and the robbing of her soul.  Not an easy film to watch, it is nevertheless a brilliant achievement celebrating the endurance of love, even in the face of Alzheimer's disease.

Now, I&#65533;m glad I saw it. It&#65533;s a beautiful film.Murdoch [1919-1999] wrote nearly thirty novels, most of which deal with the complexities and mysteries of human behavior. She also taught philosophy. She deeply loved her husband of forty years, John Bayley, a renowned literary critic. Her other great love was words. To watch her slowly losing contact with all she loved [and, thus, with all she was] is a deeply touching experience, though the movie can only begin to describe the real-life events.Iris is portrayed as a young woman by Kate Winslet. Judi Dench plays the older Iris. Young John is Hugh Bonneville, old John is Jim Broadbent, who won and Oscar for his performance. The casting is perfect, not only because the actors are great ones, but also because they blend perfectly as the movie switches back and forth between the present and the past.This is not meant to be a comprehensive biography. It touches on only a few highlights, which are meant to contrast the vibrantly alive and productive young Iris with the fragile and lost Iris at the end of her life.

690105,A1C2P5HX5RLPAX,B00005YU41,"M. E. Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""","[1, 1]","Iris Murdoch (1919 - 1999) was a prolific author and philosopher having written twenty-seven works of fiction, five philosophical books, six plays and two books of poetry. Her novel, The Sea, the Sea, won the 1978 Booker Prize. The film, Iris, is based on two of her husband John Bayley's books about her life -- Iris: A Memoir and Elegy for Iris. It covers approximately 40 years from her early courtship with John, a novelist and an English professor, until her death.The focus of this story is Iris and John's relationship and their mutual love of words. It follows the course of their rocky courtship and lovely philosophical discussions to the repetitiveness and forgetfulness that invades Iris's words, facial recognition and then beloved activities like swimming, dressing and ultimately writing, as she begins to exhibit telltale signs of Alzheimer's.The movie opens with a young couple (Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville) swimming deeply in murky water. The young forms merge into older ones (Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent) and this is pretty much how the film deals with time by switching back and forth between the here and now and lost memories.Iris was a philosopher so it's not surprising to see many philosophical ideas brought to fusion. This romantic film makes the viewer think a little afterwards. That is if you're listening to the words. Otherwise they can pass so quickly and be easily forgotten. One of these ideas is education and its individual worth. Can it in stow happiness in the bearer. And whether it is better to have ""freedom of the mind or an educated mind"".A similar idea is our attachment to words. ""If one doesn't have words, how does one think?"" There's an ongoing discussion on the importance of language and being able to communicate one's thoughts. If one can't write then one can't think which leads to thinking of Iris, the writer; if Iris can't think Iris can't write. If she can't live without thinking she can't live without writing. One of Iris's greatest fears was going mad because she considered herself one of those people who lived in their minds. When she is stricken with memory losses John is constantly trying to get her to write, thinking perhaps if she can't write then she won't lose her beautiful mind.According to the film, Iris believed that love is the only language that anybody understands. Iris was not a woman to be contained. She said what she thought and did what she wanted when she wanted often making it difficult for John to accept. But through it all he continued to love her. The film expands the concept of what love means and what it could mean to different people. Unconditional love is a recurring theme within the movie as Iris and John's relationship is continually tested.In another early scene John and Iris are racing down a road on bikes. Iris pulls ahead of him and he yells after her, ""I can't catch up with you!"" This feeling is consistent throughout their relationship whether they are on the bike or not. Near the end John constantly searches for signs of the woman he knew. Once her disease takes hold the film becomes emotionally moving and I was brought both to tears and fear of mind; especially by John's reactions, both positive and negative. He begins to move through the grieving process long before she dies. One line he says in particular brought this home for me, -I use to be so afraid of being alone with you. And now I can't be without you.-Jim Broadbent won a well deserved Oscar for his role in 2002 for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of John Bayley and it is well deserved. I also thought Hugh Bonneville's (young Bayley) performance is particularly notable and the likeness between him and Broadbent is amazing. Winslet and Dench are superb actors in their own right but there was nothing extraordinary about their performance other than their ability to meld with the other actors. Which I think is often as important as telling the story. In other words they weren't bigger than the parts they played.Iris is a heartbreaking love story about human love and the love words and thinking. I didn't see this film as a story about Alzheimer's, the word isn't even mentioned. It is more about the loss the parties involved experience. It provided a troubling look into two author's lives and peaked my interest in reading Murdoch works. If you have a love for literary artists and their lives then you'll enjoy this thoughtful film.

690106,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00005YU41,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[4, 10]","Richard Eyre's ""Iris"" deals with the last years of Iris Murdoch's (Judi Dench) life and her descent into the darkness of Alzheimers disease (It's interesting to note that the word ALZHEIMERS is never mentioned during the course of the entire film!).The film reverts from the present to the past with Kate Winslett playing Iris as a young woman: full of life and love and possesor of a magnificent intellect.But ""Iris"" is also the story of John Bayley (Jim Broadbent and Hugh Bonneville as a young man),Iris' husband and caretaker: a man whose implacable attraction to Iris leads him to accept and swallow Iris' many affairs and almost pyschotic need for privacy. (The Bayley waiting out in the rain, not wanting to interfere, while Iris makes love to other men scenes are particularly sad) But Bayley, a college professor in his own right, is no dummy and he chooses this relationship with his eyes wide open, as it were. This film would have been a lot more interesting if this part of the story had been pursued. It's surprising that it wasn't as the source material for this film is Bayley's memoir of his relationship with Murdoch.The ""dark"" scenes of Iris slowly losing contact with her life and her world are unfortunately nothing we haven't seen a hundred times on television. Judi Dench handles these scenes competently which is to be expected. And, in theory, it is pathetic, to see such a great mind inexorably dissolve. But is another made-for-television-like film about Alzheimers really necessary?  Jim Broadbent elicits our sympathy through his dogged allegiance to and love of Iris, but after one particularly crazy day he blows up at a bewildered Iris: ""I hate you...after all these years I literally know nothing about you...""The ""light"" scenes of the film with Kate Winslett and Hugh Bonneville though, are very charming and thoughtful. Winslett plays the young Iris as brazenly sexual and exceedingly intelligent and Bonneville is appropirately amazed and be-fuddled that this extraordinarily beautiful girl would even give him a second look much less agree to marry him.It is without any doubt that Iris Murdoch was a writer of the highest order: a woman who exalted education and language but what would she think of this film? I think she would find it overly-sentimental, mundane and simplistic: all the things that Iris Murdoch's transcendinngly thoughtful and intelligent writing is not.",2,She's Moving into the Darkness,1014940800,"03 1, 2002",2002,2412,"['Richard', 'Eyre', 'Iris', 'deals', 'last', 'years', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'life', 'descent', 'darkness', 'Alzheimers', 'disease', 'interesting', 'note', 'word', 'ALZHEIMERS', 'never', 'mentioned', 'course', 'entire', 'film', '.The', 'film', 'reverts', 'present', 'past', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'playing', 'Iris', 'young', 'woman', 'full', 'life', 'love', 'possesor', 'magnificent', 'intellect.But', 'Iris', 'also', 'story', 'John', 'Bayley', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'young', 'man', 'Iris', 'husband', 'caretaker', 'man', 'implacable', 'attraction', 'Iris', 'accept', 'swallow', 'Iris', 'many', 'affairs', 'almost', 'pyschotic', 'need', 'privacy', 'Bayley', 'waiting', 'out', 'rain', 'not', 'wanting', 'interfere', 'Iris', 'love', 'other', 'men', 'scenes', 'are', 'particularly', 'sad', 'Bayley', 'college', 'professor', 'own', 'right', 'dummy', 'relationship', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'were', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'part', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'pursued', 'surprising', 'was', ""n't"", 'source', 'material', 'film', 'Bayley', 'memoir', 'relationship', 'Murdoch.The', 'dark', 'scenes', 'Iris', 'slowly', 'losing', 'contact', 'life', 'world', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'television', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'scenes', 'competently', 'be', 'expected', 'theory', 'pathetic', 'see', 'such', 'great', 'mind', 'inexorably', 'dissolve', 'made-for-television-like', 'film', 'Alzheimers', 'really', 'necessary', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'sympathy', 'dogged', 'allegiance', 'love', 'Iris', 'one', 'particularly', 'crazy', 'day', 'up', 'bewildered', 'Iris', 'hate', 'years', 'literally', 'know', 'nothing', 'light', 'scenes', 'film', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'are', 'very', 'charming', 'thoughtful', 'Winslett', 'young', 'Iris', 'brazenly', 'sexual', 'exceedingly', 'intelligent', 'Bonneville', 'appropirately', 'amazed', 'be-fuddled', 'extraordinarily', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'would', 'even', 'give', 'second', 'look', 'much', 'less', 'agree', 'marry', 'him.It', 'doubt', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'was', 'writer', 'highest', 'order', 'woman', 'who', 'exalted', 'education', 'language', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'find', 'overly-sentimental', 'mundane', 'simplistic', 'things', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'transcendinngly', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'not']",N/A
690107,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00005YU41,Michael J. Mazza,"[12, 15]","""Iris,"" directed by Richard Eyre, is at its heart a love story. The film tells the story of British novelist Iris Murdoch and her husband, professor John Bayley. The film focuses on two specific time periods in this enduring relationship: the beginning, when they were a romancing young couple, and the later years, when an aging Iris began to mentally deteriorate due to a brain disease.Rather then tell the story chronologically, the filmmakers switch back and forth between these two time periods. The result is quite effective. This technique is greatly enhanced by the principal actors: Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent as the older couple, and Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville as their younger incarnations. The four great performances mesh together seamlessly.Bonneville gives a touching performance as the intelligent but awkward young man who is captivated by the bold young Iris. Winslet gives her young Iris a commanding intellect and a powerful sexuality, both of which are lit by an intriguing inner fire. She's a joy to watch. Dench and Broadbent are heartbreaking as they take these characters into their struggle against Iris' devastating illness. These four actors definitely make ""Iris"" worth seeing.The parts of the film that focused on Iris' illness seemed somewhat choppy at times; I found it difficult to get a sense of how exactly the disease was progressing. Nevertheless, ""Iris"" rises above the stereotypical ""disease-of-the-week"" genre due to great performances, as well as to the films's overall effective structure.

Whoever said that films of late have lost all of their heart and soul, have not viewed, ""Iris.""Judi Dench as the aging and increasingly senile Iris Murdoch plays a powerful and honest role.  Kate Winslet as the ebullient, witty, and on the cusp of greatness young Murdoch plays the role truly, but really can not match Dench's presence.  Murdoch's enchantingly scatter-brained husband John Bayley (who also wrote two memoirs about Murdoch that you may want to check out titled, ""Iris and Her Friends,"" and ""Elegy for Iris"") is played by Jim Broadbent (the elder) and Hugh Bonneville (the younger).  These roles almost hold up to watching Dench and it truly is uncanny how close the actors are made to resemble each other.  I had to watch the credits to ensure that Bayley wasn't played by just one actor with a good make-up artist.You watch with anguish as such a stark dichotomy is created between the beautiful mind and energetic soul of the younger Iris and the dilapidated and brain-dulled disintegration that the elder Iris falls into as she succumbs to Alzheimer's.  Through it all though, it is not a story about a disease and dying.  It is a story about how two souls can come together, two unlikely souls as different as they are in love, to express a love against all reason, a love that binds them through equally in times of joy and times of loss.",5,"Bravo Madame Dench, Bravo Madame Murdoch",1036454400,"11 5, 2002",2002,1492,"['story', 'British', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'lovingly', 'artfully', 'told', 'as', 'well', 'acted', 'life-enriching', 'movie', 'Whoever', 'said', 'films', 'late', 'have', 'lost', 'heart', 'soul', 'have', 'not', 'viewed', 'Iris', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'aging', 'increasingly', 'senile', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'powerful', 'honest', 'role', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'ebullient', 'witty', 'cusp', 'greatness', 'young', 'Murdoch', 'role', 'truly', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'match', 'Dench', 'presence', 'Murdoch', 'enchantingly', 'scatter-brained', 'husband', 'John', 'Bayley', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'two', 'memoirs', 'Murdoch', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'titled', 'Iris', 'Her', 'Friends', 'Elegy', 'Iris', 'played', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'elder', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'younger', 'roles', 'almost', 'hold', 'up', 'watching', 'Dench', 'truly', 'uncanny', 'how', 'close', 'actors', 'are', 'made', 'resemble', 'other', 'had', 'watch', 'credits', 'ensure', 'Bayley', 'was', ""n't"", 'played', 'just', 'one', 'actor', 'good', 'make-up', 'artist.You', 'watch', 'anguish', 'such', 'stark', 'dichotomy', 'created', 'beautiful', 'mind', 'energetic', 'soul', 'younger', 'Iris', 'dilapidated', 'brain-dulled', 'disintegration', 'elder', 'Iris', 'Alzheimer', 'not', 'story', 'disease', 'dying', 'story', 'how', 'two', 'souls', 'can', 'come', 'together', 'two', 'unlikely', 'souls', 'as', 'different', 'are', 'love', 'express', 'love', 'reason', 'love', 'equally', 'times', 'joy', 'times', 'loss']",N/A

John seems in a perpetual state of admiration for Iris, who blossoms into a celebrated novelist. Clearly, John is the lover and Iris is the loved in their relationship. Iris is the sun, and John is the planet that orbits around her. And John seems ecstatic that this is the nature of things.As the two age, however, Iris falls prey to Alzheimer's, and her fine mind, which has always been her greatest attribute (and one of John's greatest loves), begins to fail. The story follows John and Iris as the illness takes greater possession of her and John struggles to cope without the central force/focus of his life.Performances are wonderful in this, particularly those of Broadbent and Dench. Hugh Bonneville gives an uncanny take on a young Jim Broadbent/John Bayley. This movie is sad, because it is about losing someone that you love. But there are hopeful moments, too, when John celebrates the pieces of Iris that are still left to him, the brief moments of lucidity that the universe seems to grant her.I find it interesting that, though Iris Murdoch is much more widely-published than Bayley has been (most of his work is literary criticism), it is his silm, loving volume of tribute to her that is so well-known.

For John Bayley and Iris Murdoch, it's even less of a picnic.  Barely upon completion of her final novel, the celebrated writer Murdoch is beginning to sink into dementia brought on by Alzheimer's Disease.Through flashbacks, we see how this 'nation of two'(Bayley and Murdoch) formed a union.  Iris Murdoch (portrayed in her young years by Kate Winslet) is a liberated freethinker.  Her daringness is symbolized in one scene by the bright red dress that she wears to a party.  It is the one bit of color in a relentlessly and purposefully drab-colored movie.Young Iris selects the awkwardly shy and stuttering John Bayley as her mate because she recognizes his unstinting goodness.  She may also recognize that he is an insurance policy against her future loneliness...for it is quickly established that Iris is the stronger of the pair, and that dutiful John will suffer for his love of her.The older Iris is portrayed by Judi Dench, who gives a justly praised performance.  Looking like the kind of lost soul portrayed in the photographs of Diane Arbus,  Dench through her acting shows the progression of Alzheimer's symptoms from the first subtle signs to the final ravages.Jim Broadbent is also superb as the older John Bayley.  As the caregiver left with his faculties fully intact, it is he who must register recognizable human emotions from apprehension and hope, to resentment, despair and rage.Kate Winslet certainly does nothing here to diminish her reputation as one of the most fiercely intelligent of young actresses.""Iris"" is a film that is British to the core.

Iris MurdockI love the writing of Iris Murdock and her quotes even more so. The film about her life and her slip into oblivion is a marvelous feat. How could a book written by her husband, John Bayle be so provocative and fascinating?  It is the four actors who play Iris and John in their 43  year marriage that makes this film a true treasure. Iris was born of Irish parents and moved to London as a small child. She was an intelligent, out spoken young woman and took up Literature at Oxford. It was during this time that she met John. Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville play the young couple. A more two unlikely pair. Iris outgoing, outspoken and with many friends. John introverted, someone who stuttered with few friends. But fall in love they did- both highly intelligent- John was a literature professor and Iris wrote books- wonderful books that gained her fame and she became a Dame of the Empire. They settled into their lives with their writings and their friends.As Iris approached the age of 55 she noted forgetfulness, unable to remember a word here and there. At this age, Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent played their aging counterparts.  Iris was examined and in the film no diagnosis was spoken, but we know it is Alzheimer. Judi Dench plays an amazing Iris during this period. Her every glance and facial expression give us the feel of one who is slipping away.  It is Jim Broadbent as John who is amazing. As a caretaker he exhibits the grace of one who loves, but also the lethargy and extreme fatigue of caring for someone who is active but must be watched at all times. He is in a time and place of his own, but he insists upon caring for Iris by himself. As time goes on we see him slip into forgetfulness himself, until he realizes he must do something.An amazing film, difficult to view at times if you have someone who is slipping away.  But for all of us who love someone and for those of us who care, we view this film as a devoted husband giving his loved wife the tribute she deserves.Recommended.  prisrob 03-22-09Ladies in LavenderRevolutionary RoadHeroes & Villains: The Last Englishman",4,Love Can Conquer All- Almost,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2256,"['absolute', 'yearning', 'one', 'human', 'body', 'particular', 'body', 'indifference', 'substitutes', 'one', 'life', 'major', 'mysteries', 'Iris', 'MurdockI', 'love', 'writing', 'Iris', 'Murdock', 'quotes', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'film', 'life', 'slip', 'oblivion', 'marvelous', 'feat', 'How', 'could', 'book', 'written', 'husband', 'John', 'Bayle', 'be', 'so', 'provocative', 'fascinating', 'four', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Iris', 'John', '43', 'year', 'marriage', 'film', 'true', 'treasure', 'Iris', 'was', 'born', 'Irish', 'parents', 'moved', 'London', 'small', 'child', 'was', 'intelligent', 'spoken', 'young', 'woman', 'took', 'up', 'Literature', 'Oxford', 'was', 'time', 'met', 'John', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'play', 'young', 'couple', 'more', 'two', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'Iris', 'outgoing', 'outspoken', 'many', 'friends', 'John', 'introverted', 'someone', 'who', 'stuttered', 'few', 'friends', 'fall', 'love', 'did-', 'highly', 'intelligent-', 'John', 'was', 'literature', 'professor', 'Iris', 'wrote', 'books-', 'wonderful', 'books', 'gained', 'fame', 'became', 'Dame', 'Empire', 'settled', 'lives', 'writings', 'friends.As', 'Iris', 'approached', 'age', '55', 'noted', 'forgetfulness', 'unable', 'remember', 'word', 'here', 'there', 'age', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'played', 'aging', 'counterparts', 'Iris', 'was', 'examined', 'film', 'diagnosis', 'was', 'spoken', 'know', 'Alzheimer', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'amazing', 'Iris', 'period', 'glance', 'facial', 'expression', 'give', 'feel', 'one', 'who', 'slipping', 'away', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'John', 'who', 'amazing', 'caretaker', 'grace', 'one', 'who', 'also', 'lethargy', 'extreme', 'fatigue', 'caring', 'someone', 'who', 'active', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'times', 'time', 'place', 'own', 'caring', 'Iris', 'time', 'see', 'slip', 'forgetfulness', 'must', 'do', 'something.An', 'amazing', 'film', 'difficult', 'view', 'times', 'have', 'someone', 'who', 'slipping', 'away', 'who', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'care', 'view', 'film', 'devoted', 'husband', 'giving', 'loved', 'wife', 'tribute', 'deserves.Recommended', 'prisrob', '03-22-09Ladies', 'LavenderRevolutionary', 'RoadHeroes', 'Villains', 'Last', 'Englishman']",N/A

She's quite a libertine and he's not even had a woman yet.They move in together.  While John is an intelligent and strong man in his own rights, he becomes Iris' shadow and later her caretaker as Alzheimer's ravages one of the finest minds.The film's heartrending tale is beautifully acted on the parts of both the young and old versions of Iris and John. John has some harsh realities to face with both the infidelities of the younger woman and the fragilities of the older.The story's told honestly, but with compassion.

690123,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005YU41,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","Iris (Richard Eyre, 2001)Iris is a great film, perhaps one of the finest I've ever seen. I won't be watching it again.It is the true (but, as it's based on the books written by her husband, likely revisionist) story of two discrete and parallel points in Iris Murdoch's life-her and her husband's courtship, and her slow descent into Alzheimer's, culminating in her death in 1999.Iris and John and played, respectively, by the teams of Kate Winslet (Quills, Heavenly Creatures) and Hugh Bonneville (proof once and for all that you can take a sex symbol and make him look like a geek), and Judi Dench (As Time Goes By, Chocolat) and Jim Broadbent (Little Voice, Gangs of New York). Both couples' performances have their strong points, to be sure, but it is the performance of Dame Judi Dench that takes what would otherwise have been a good above-average film and makes it into something both great and unwatchable.Dench, in the last few years, has turned onscreen death into an art form.  In Chocolat, it was expected, but quick and relatively painless. Here it is slow, lingering, devastating to watch as Murdoch loses her faculties over the course of roughly four years (the book she is writing at the beginning of the film was released in 1996). It is, perhaps, the finest achievement of a career that has never been less than great. (And yes, since I know you're going to ask after a comment like that, I HAVE seen Dead Cert, thank you.)Finding the parallel between the two stories is somewhat difficult at first, but absolutely critical to understanding the reason that Eyre and co-author Charles Wood emphasized the things they did from Bayley's biographies. (It helps to know that Bayley referred to Murdoch during the last stages of her life as ""a nice three-year-old."" Keep it in mind while you're watching the film, especially when Winslet and Bonneville are doing their thing.)  Without that, it is possible to mistake Iris for another of those recent films studded with great performances, but with little substance beneath (In the Bedroom, White Oleander, et al.). Rest assured, however, there is far more to this than the performances.It seems rather odd that Richard Eyre, for almost twenty years from the release of the sweet and wonderful Laughterhouse, directed exclusively for BBC Television. Iris was his first big-screen film since. His next, The Assumption, will be directed from a script written by Anthony Minghella and starring one of the greatest actors of our time, Javier Bardem. And yet I find it hard to believe that, no matter how perfectly The Assumption turns out, it will have anywhere near the effect of Iris. *****",5,Painful to watch.,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,2650,"['Iris', 'Richard', 'Eyre', '2001', 'Iris', 'great', 'film', 'perhaps', 'one', 'finest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'again.It', 'true', 'based', 'books', 'written', 'husband', 'likely', 'revisionist', 'story', 'two', 'discrete', 'parallel', 'points', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'life-her', 'husband', 'courtship', 'slow', 'descent', 'Alzheimer', 'culminating', 'death', '1999.Iris', 'John', 'played', 'respectively', 'teams', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Quills', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'proof', 'once', 'can', 'take', 'sex', 'symbol', 'make', 'look', 'geek', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Time', 'Goes', 'Chocolat', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Little', 'Voice', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'couples', 'performances', 'have', 'strong', 'points', 'be', 'sure', 'performance', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'above-average', 'film', 'something', 'great', 'unwatchable.Dench', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'turned', 'onscreen', 'death', 'art', 'form', 'Chocolat', 'was', 'expected', 'quick', 'relatively', 'painless', 'Here', 'slow', 'lingering', 'devastating', 'watch', 'Murdoch', 'faculties', 'course', 'roughly', 'four', 'years', 'book', 'writing', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1996', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'achievement', 'career', 'never', 'been', 'less', 'great', 'yes', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'ask', 'comment', 'HAVE', 'seen', 'Dead', 'Cert', 'thank', 'Finding', 'parallel', 'two', 'stories', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'first', 'absolutely', 'critical', 'understanding', 'reason', 'Eyre', 'co-author', 'Charles', 'Wood', 'emphasized', 'things', 'did', 'Bayley', 'biographies', 'know', 'Bayley', 'referred', 'Murdoch', 'last', 'stages', 'life', 'nice', 'three-year-old', 'Keep', 'mind', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'Winslet', 'Bonneville', 'are', 'doing', 'thing', 'possible', 'mistake', 'Iris', 'recent', 'films', 'studded', 'great', 'performances', 'little', 'substance', 'beneath', 'Bedroom', 'White', 'Oleander', 'et', 'al.', 'Rest', 'assured', 'however', 'far', 'more', 'performances.It', 'rather', 'odd', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'release', 'sweet', 'wonderful', 'Laughterhouse', 'directed', 'exclusively', 'BBC', 'Television', 'Iris', 'was', 'first', 'big-screen', 'film', 'next', 'Assumption', 'will', 'be', 'directed', 'script', 'written', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', 'starring', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'time', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'yet', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'matter', 'how', 'perfectly', 'Assumption', 'out', 'will', 'have', 'anywhere', 'effect', 'Iris', '*****']",N/A

Not just their acting, but the way the two pairs of younger/older performers mesh with one another.  In particular, Jim Broadbent and Hugh Bonneville are amazingly believable as the same character.  Bonneville (whom I primarily knew as ""Bernie"" the inept stock broker in NOTTING HILL) is the least well known of the quartet, but more than holds his own as the young John Bayley.  Jim Broadbent, who is one of the seven acting marvels of the modern world (doubt me?  Watch him back-to-back in this film, MOULIN ROUGE, TOPSY-TURVY, THE SECRET AGENT, and NICHOLAS NICKLEBY--it doesn't seem possible that the same actor is in each film), won a well-deserved Oscar as the mature Bayley (even though he was around 20 years too young for the role, being only around 53 at the time of filming).  Kate Winslet manages to communicate the charisma that so many felt in the young Iris Murdoch, while Judi Dench is extraordinary in registering the onset of the loss of self that Iris Murdoch felt as the Alzheimer's gained more and more control of her.I do have one complaint, one felt by the person I saw this with.  It seems to end too abruptly.  All films have, or ought to have, a rhythm.  Any experienced film viewer can usually sense how much is left in a film.  At the point where IRIS suddenly ended, however, I would have guessed that there was at lest 15 minutes left.  At it was, it seemed to end two or three scenes too quickly.A personal note.  I actually knew a person fairly well who makes a very, very oblique appearance in the film.  The young John Bayley accidentally discovers Iris having sex with a man she later describes as a prominent Italian professor of ancient history who lives in London with his wife (considered by many to be one of the very greatest ancient historians of the past century).  I won't reveal names (for that, read Peter Conradi's excellent biography, where the professor's identity will be made fairly obvious).  No longer living, he used to live part of each year on the campus where I attended grad school, at the faculty club where I was graveyard shift desk clerk.  Each evening he would come in from the library and we would talk about one subject or another.  We actually discussed Iris Murdoch one night, though I didn't know, and he didn't reveal, that he knew her.  I was reading BRUNO'S DREAM, and I complained that she didn't seem to understand male psychology.

690127,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00005YU41,Sheryl Fechter,"[7, 8]","The life of 20th century English author and personality Iris Murdoch, insightfully portrayed through an amazing Judi Dench, is full of memorable moments at least. At best, it is a tapestry of change and a shift in thinking woven within a free-spirited woman far ahead of her time, developed through a brilliant cast. I would choose the latter.Director Richard Eyre steers the movie through Murdoch's adult years while flashing back to her younger days. The young Iris, as relevant to this movie as Dench, is portrayed by Kate Winslet.  She captivates with so much attitude and a sharp attractiveness while remaining fully engaged with the story.The role of appreciative counterpart/husband to Iris (John Bayley), is also evocatively done with an understated grace, concern and unbelievable patience by Jim Broadbent.  The younger Bayley, 'adoringly hanging on every word written or spoken from Murdoch', is portrayed with an uncanny innocence by Hugh Bonneville (looking like he could actually have aged into the looks of Broadbent).Bayley and Murdoch are a quizzical combination of personalities for the attraction that they share. He is shy and quiet while she is extroverted, and at times excusing other's opinions preferring her own. Throughout their relationship John remains fascinated with her always.John, a young man and professor very interested in the outward and forward-thinking Iris, does not travel in the same circles as she (scrutinizing, academic and enjoying all kinds of socializing), although they do form a fast friendship during a short period.This born in adoration toward Iris while she says to ""just hold on tight"" to her.  He is ever entertained by her wit while pursuing her and captivated with her ability to be so forthright, while he prefers a certain solitude and order assigned to his life.They are able to connect in their younger years on the level of John's pervasive grounded place of sensibility for Iris.  She is always able to count on John for any and everything, forming a mutual respect for each other regardless of personality.Through many rougher times, and easy summer days of bike riding and swimming, they form a lasting bond leading right into marriage and constant encouragement for Iris. John says to Iris in the latter years, ""You live with the angels, speak their voices, that's what you do"" as she is consistently challenging conventional boundaries.To now jump forward into their progressed marriage; Iris begins to forget things, even what she is writing about in her most recent work. Iris, being interviewed and in the middle of a speech, wanders off in thought and gets lost in her mind. The daily ""post"" becomes the only thing that she is acutely aware of.  Cartoon watching becomes her primary source of 'entertainment' as total confusion overtakes her.John begins filling in all the blanks for her as she receives her diagnosis of dementia and her 'world of words' comes crashing down.  What remains so unique to them is their ability to find the humor in situations, taking them with the shrug of a shoulder, and subtle laughter for most of the time.The doctors eventually have to come into their world after Iris becomes lost following the postman out of the door.

690129,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005YU41,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","Film biographies are tricky things. In a written biography, the author can explore the thought process, the moods, the intellect of the subject ands attempt to explain what made them interesting or great in their field. Film biographies essentially become a Cliff Notes version of the subject's life. It would be impossible to accurately and intelligently depict a person's entire life in a film, so the filmmakers have to depict an important period or an important series of events. The more memorable film biographies of the last few years have done this; ""Man In The Moon"" depicted a series of events, skipping around randomly, ending at the premiere of the TV show `Taxi', ""Ed Wood"" depicted a very strange man's road to become a film director. Both of these films, in addition to the third most memorable film biography of the last few years, were all written by the same team. They each cover a significant period of time in the subjects life.""Iris"", directed by Richard Eyre and adapted from the bestselling memoirs of his wife, written by John Bayley, depicts two periods from the life of novelist Iris Murdoch. The first is when Iris and John met and the second is during the last years of her life, before she succumbed to Alzheimer's.The film contains two great performances. Judi Dench portrays Iris Murdoch at the end of her life and really makes the character believable. Even more interesting is the fact that her character has so few lines during this period. Most of her character is built with facial mannerisms and body movements. The other great performance belongs to Jim Broadbent. His portrayal of John Bayley is another great addition to his resume. Broadbent is, and probably always will be, a character actor, but he gives dignity to the meaning. Too unconventional to be a leading man, he continues to turn in one memorable performance after another. In his last three films, he steals virtually every scene he is in. His performance in ""Topsy Turvy"" was truly memorable, but his performance in ""Moulin Rouge"" was memorable, showy, grandiose and restrained all at the same time (difficult in any circumstance, but more so in such a frantic film). In ""Iris"", he plays a character who is probably 20 years older than the actor but never seems to be acting. He is a man so completely and utterly in love with this woman that nothing else matters in the film.The film is memorable in that it uses two very good actresses to portray Iris Murdoch. Kate Winslet portrays the novelist in her twenties, when she first met John Bayley. Unfortunately either the writing or the acting prevented me from caring about this character, so it was difficult for me to see why John Bayley was so in love with her, especially in the scenes with Dench and Broadbent. Watching the scenes with Dench and Broadbent became a strange experience. I enjoyed Dench's performance immensely and loved watching Broadbent, but because I didn't understand why he fell in love with the Winslet character, I didn't believe in the relationship despite the strength of the acting. I hope that makes sense.Also, the film seems to be constructed rather haphazardly. Cutting back and forth between the two time periods throughout the entire film, the film seems to lose its focus. Usually when a film cuts back and forth between two time periods the events in each time period are meant to emphasize the other. I didn't see the correlation between the two in ""Iris"". Yes, one period is when the two writers met and the other is at the end of their relationship, but that doesn't seem strong enough.I have never read an Iris Murdoch novel or the two books written by John Bayley and I still don't know why Murdoch was considered so great. This is a fatal flaw in any biography. After watching ""Ed Wood"" and never seeing any of his actual films, I can recognize that he was a strange but extremely committed man. After watching ""Man In The Moon"", I get a sense of Andy Kaufman's strange comedic sensibilities. After watching ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"", I get a sense that Larry Flynt was also interested in fighting censorship, even if it may have been profit based. I don't get a sense of what made Murdoch's writing good, great, interesting or memorable. Why? Because we only hear her speak at two functions. Are these speeches related to her writing? We only see her struggle with writing one book, but we don't hear any of the writing or find out about the book.The film is being released by Miramax for a week, before the end of the year, to qualify for Oscars. They probably believe that the film is worthy of Oscar nominations and at least two of the actors probably should get a nomination. But because the film doesn't explain anything about what makes Murdoch's life or work great, I can't recommend it. Thew film actually fails miserably on that note.""Iris"" is a well-intentioned, but unsuccessful film biography of a writer that I still know very little about.",3,Good Performances By Dench and

690130,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005YU41,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 6]","On Feburary 28, 1999, one of the greatest novelists of the 20th century died.  It is Iris Murdoch, the Iris of this tender, but at times very bitter film.  But don't be put off by her name or profile; you don't even have to tell Oxford from Cambridge because &quot;Iris&quot; is a story of love.  And the acting is really great.Iris Murdoch met her future husband John Bayley at Oxford.  Vivacious, free-spirited Iris was teaching philosophy while  Bayley was a teacher of English literature.  Iris is gradually attracted to shy and sincere Bayley, and one day confesses that she is writing a novel, showing him a manuscript.  They get married in 1956, to live together happily for long years to come.But around the year 1997, they find something is not quite right.  Iris starts to forget the spelling of words, or the name of the prime minister.  And they find that she suffers from Alzheimer's disease.  Bayley continues to support her, but it is obvious that the time is near when they cannot live together as they did any more.The two parts of the real-life events are depicted one after the other; the young John Bayley is played by Hugh Bonneville while the older Bayley by Jim Broadbent.  The young Iris Murdoch is by Kate Winslet, and the older, by Judi Dench.  Kudos to those actors; all of them are so convincing as the characters that you get uncanny feeling that Hugh Boneville has really grown up to be Jim Broadbent, who had to play the person in fact about 20 years older than himself.  And about these female players, we don't need any superflous praise; Judi Dench is great, so is Kate Winslet.  That's it.However, there is one minor setback.  The double-plot development the film employs is surely heavy-handed and damages the whole work, undermining the potential of the story based on the truth.  Too frequent flash-backing/flash-forwarding is just annoying, and makes the film like a long train of vignettes.  The vignettes themselves are well-crafted, but joined together, they somehow alienate us, the viewers, who want to get inside of these characters.  And by the use of the double plot, the minor characters lost their functions in the film; you see one character &quot;Maurice&quot; played by off-screen father and son Timothy West and Samuel West, but that does not work at all, or we simply forget about this person who is buried among the maze of the script.The camera is beautiful, the music is good, but the director Richard Eyre betrays that though he is good at inducing the actors to play their best, he is a director for stage, not for film.  (And he is famous as stage director.)  Like &quot;American Beauty&quot; (of which director, as you know, comes from stage origin), the film is a blessed moment for actors, but not necessarily for moviegoers especialy when they, like me, prefer the dynamic power of story or well-chosen dialogues.  I do not say &quot;Iris&quot; is bad; just not for all taste.All in all, &quot;Iris&quot; is a fantastic experience to get to know one of the most charming couple among the literary world.  After all, the film may change the stereotyped profiles of Iris Murdoch such as I quoted before: like, &quot;most acclaimed novelist and philosopher' etc.  And I believe the real Iris is as much an enchanting person as this film shows, or even more.",4,"A Love Story, Young and Old, Sweet and Bitter, in Oxford",1043798400,"01 29, 2003",2003,3318,"['Feburary', '28', '1999', 'one', 'greatest', 'novelists', '20th', 'century', 'died', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'Iris', 'tender', 'times', 'very', 'bitter', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'name', 'profile', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'tell', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'quot', 'Iris', 'quot', 'story', 'love', 'acting', 'really', 'great.Iris', 'Murdoch', 'met', 'future', 'husband', 'John', 'Bayley', 'Oxford', 'Vivacious', 'free-spirited', 'Iris', 'was', 'teaching', 'philosophy', 'Bayley', 'was', 'teacher', 'English', 'literature', 'Iris', 'gradually', 'attracted', 'shy', 'sincere', 'Bayley', 'one', 'day', 'writing', 'novel', 'showing', 'manuscript', 'get', 'married', '1956', 'live', 'together', 'happily', 'long', 'years', 'come.But', 'year', '1997', 'find', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'Iris', 'forget', 'spelling', 'words', 'name', 'prime', 'minister', 'find', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'Bayley', 'support', 'obvious', 'time', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'together', 'did', 'more.The', 'two', 'parts', 'real-life', 'events', 'are', 'depicted', 'one', 'other', 'young', 'John', 'Bayley', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'older', 'Bayley', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'young', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'older', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Kudos', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'convincing', 'characters', 'get', 'uncanny', 'feeling', 'Hugh', 'Boneville', 'really', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'who', 'had', 'play', 'person', 'fact', '20', 'years', 'older', 'female', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'superflous', 'praise', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'great', 'so', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'it.However', 'one', 'minor', 'setback', 'double-plot', 'development', 'film', 'surely', 'heavy-handed', 'damages', 'whole', 'work', 'undermining', 'potential', 'story', 'based', 'truth', 'Too', 'frequent', 'flash-backing/flash-forwarding', 'just', 'annoying', 'film', 'long', 'train', 'vignettes', 'vignettes', 'are', 'well-crafted', 'joined', 'together', 'somehow', 'alienate', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'characters', 'use', 'double', 'plot', 'minor', 'characters', 'lost', 'functions', 'film', 'see', 'one', 'character', 'quot', 'Maurice', 'quot', 'played', 'off-screen', 'father', 'son', 'Timothy', 'West', 'Samuel', 'West', 'not', 'work', 'simply', 'forget', 'person', 'who', 'buried', 'maze', 'script.The', 'camera', 'beautiful', 'music', 'good', 'director', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'good', 'inducing', 'actors', 'play', 'best', 'director', 'stage', 'not', 'film', 'famous', 'stage', 'director', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'director', 'know', 'stage', 'origin', 'film', 'blessed', 'moment', 'actors', 'not', 'necessarily', 'moviegoers', 'especialy', 'when', 'prefer', 'dynamic', 'power', 'story', 'well-chosen', 'dialogues', 'do', 'not', 'say', 'quot', 'Iris', 'quot', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'taste.All', 'quot', 'Iris', 'quot', 'fantastic', 'experience', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'couple', 'literary', 'world', 'film', 'may', 'change', 'stereotyped', 'profiles', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'such', 'quoted', 'quot', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'novelist', 'philosopher', 'etc', 'believe', 'real', 'Iris', 'as', 'much', 'enchanting', 'person', 'film', 'even', 'more']",N/A

It focuses on her battle with dementia late in her life, interspersed with scenes form her early relationship with her husband, when Iris was free-spirited.  This contrast leads to many genuinely touching moments (note: although most of the audience where I saw the movie were elderly, I am in my 30's and found the movie touching).The main reason to see Iris, however, is the acting.  Judi Dench, Kate Winslet, and Jim Broadbent are all nominated for Oscars this year, and rightly so.  They are extraordinary, as is Hugh Bonneville, who plays Iris's husband, John Bayley, in the early years.  The acting is superb throughout, and as a result, there is rarely a false moment.Despite these strengths, the movie was still somewhat lacking.  Part of the problem is that we gain little understanding about what made Iris tick as a writer.  The movie also lingers a bit too much on scenes of her deterioration.  Most people who watch this movie are probably familiar with the effects of dementia, and the movie depicts these effects well and rather tastefully.  However, at times, it became manipulative and ultimely repetitive.

Rather it is a romp through her life with John from their meeting and through flashbacks and returns a comparison of their lives together then and the present of the film. It would be a little too risqu&eacute; to play for students in class though I suppose everything was meant to portray the character of Iris as John recalls her. What the movie does do is encourages reading since one is curious about what the movie leaves out - what she wrote. There are a few choice interviews that Dench does wonderfully. Of interest is the happy YouTube offerings of several interviews with Iris Murdoch so one can compare. But I suppose the main concern of the movie is to present the unfortunate future for many who live the life of the mind and the eventual loss of it.

Indeed, this film could have been about anyone, for it was not so much a biography as it was a fable about the irony of life. The second half of Iris's life is played out like a grotesque parody or inversion of the first. The editing and symbolism are fairly oblique in their attempt to get across this theme, but there is no denying that this is an aesthetically stunning and incredibly beautiful film, if a little heavy-handed at times. James Horner's score is haunting, even though one wishes the BBC had gone for some homegrown talent.The counterbalance to the tragic irony is found in the enduring love and warmth in the relationship between Iris and John, played touchingly by Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent, with Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville as the lovers in their younger years. The pain and anguish of Iris's descent into the late stages of Alzheimers are movingly portrayed.",4,"A beautiful, moving experience",1071964800,"12 21, 2003",2003,995,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'quot', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'famous', 'novelist', 'quot', 'Indeed', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anyone', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'biography', 'was', 'fable', 'irony', 'life', 'second', 'half', 'Iris', 'life', 'played', 'out', 'grotesque', 'parody', 'inversion', 'first', 'editing', 'symbolism', 'are', 'fairly', 'oblique', 'attempt', 'get', 'theme', 'denying', 'aesthetically', 'stunning', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'little', 'heavy-handed', 'times', 'James', 'Horner', 'score', 'haunting', 'even', 'one', 'BBC', 'had', 'gone', 'homegrown', 'talent.The', 'counterbalance', 'tragic', 'irony', 'found', 'enduring', 'love', 'warmth', 'relationship', 'Iris', 'John', 'played', 'touchingly', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'lovers', 'younger', 'years', 'pain', 'anguish', 'Iris', 'descent', 'late', 'stages', 'Alzheimers', 'are', 'movingly', 'portrayed']",N/A

The first so often is blissfully ignorant of what is to come; it is a lusty hormonal flaring, a  fiery freefall of blind trust. The latter, however, is filled with bumpy and bristling knowledge of all that has been; it is crisscrossed and ravaged with battle scars, tender with experience of both shadows and light, neither blind nor ignorant - nevertheless, it survives. My respect and admiration for that kind of survival is boundless. There is nothing so beautiful as old love.My favorite scene in the movie &quot;Iris&quot; is when this woman of once-brilliant mind leaps from a speeding car driven by her husband. She leaps into the night, somersaulting into the ditch alongside the winding road. He swerves in panic, leaves the car on the shoulder of the road, hobbles and runs as fast as an old man may back to find her. And there she is.... When he, too, loses his balance and somersaults into the ditch, he finds her. She is lying in the leaves and grass on her back, peacefully examining the starred sky. Crawling over to lie beside her in the leaves, he too lies on his back and watches the sky. And why not. Fallen into a ditch alongside a winding road, what better thing to do than to count stars. For a tiny moment in time, Iris is lucid... or perhaps not. Perhaps it is only something that is deep within her, deeper than the clouding of Alzheimer's, deep in that place where heart beyond mind remembers. The old woman turns her head to look at the old man who is her lifelong mate and simply says: &quot;I love you.&quot; The old man smiles. He loves her too, and that is why this story is such a moving one. Having seen each other through the wilds of youth, through the cripplings of old age, through the grind of daily creative work, these two share lasting love.Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent, who portray this couple in old age, deserve all awards given them for this performance. Both resemble the real Iris Murdoch and John Bayley not only in physical appearance, remarkably so, but they portray the couple with always the right amount of humor, emotion, and sensitivity. As the young Iris, Kate Winslet's performance exceeds any I have seen from her prior to this film. She, too, is to be applauded.Had Iris Murdoch been portrayed in more detail - as writer, as philosopher, as a woman - prior to Alzheimer's, it would have added a pleasing dimension to this otherwise excellent movie. And still, the movie wins out with its message of tender endurance, even through the tragedy of loss when such a bright mind is slowly and agonizingly extinguished.",5,A Tender Endurance,1030492800,"08 28, 2002",2002,2742,"['Being', 'somewhere', 'two', 'youth', 'old', 'age', 'find', 'feel', 'envy', 'whatsoever', 'when', 'see', 'youth', 'love', 'feel', 'when', 'see', 'aged', 'love', 'first', 'so', 'often', 'blissfully', 'ignorant', 'what', 'come', 'lusty', 'hormonal', 'flaring', 'fiery', 'freefall', 'blind', 'trust', 'latter', 'however', 'filled', 'bumpy', 'bristling', 'knowledge', 'been', 'crisscrossed', 'ravaged', 'battle', 'scars', 'tender', 'experience', 'shadows', 'light', 'ignorant', 'nevertheless', 'respect', 'admiration', 'kind', 'survival', 'boundless', 'nothing', 'so', 'beautiful', 'old', 'love.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'quot', 'Iris', 'quot', 'when', 'woman', 'once-brilliant', 'mind', 'leaps', 'speeding', 'car', 'driven', 'husband', 'night', 'somersaulting', 'ditch', 'winding', 'road', 'panic', 'car', 'shoulder', 'road', 'hobbles', 'as', 'fast', 'old', 'man', 'may', 'back', 'find', 'When', 'too', 'balance', 'somersaults', 'ditch', 'lying', 'leaves', 'grass', 'back', 'peacefully', 'examining', 'starred', 'sky', 'Crawling', 'lie', 'beside', 'leaves', 'too', 'back', 'sky', 'why', 'not', 'Fallen', 'ditch', 'winding', 'road', 'what', 'better', 'thing', 'do', 'count', 'stars', 'tiny', 'moment', 'time', 'Iris', 'lucid', 'perhaps', 'not', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'something', 'deep', 'deeper', 'clouding', 'Alzheimer', 'deep', 'place', 'where', 'heart', 'mind', 'remembers', 'old', 'woman', 'head', 'look', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'lifelong', 'mate', 'simply', 'quot', 'love', 'you.', 'quot', 'old', 'man', 'too', 'why', 'story', 'such', 'moving', 'one', 'Having', 'seen', 'other', 'wilds', 'youth', 'cripplings', 'old', 'age', 'grind', 'daily', 'creative', 'work', 'two', 'share', 'lasting', 'love.Judi', 'Dench', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'who', 'portray', 'couple', 'old', 'age', 'deserve', 'awards', 'given', 'performance', 'resemble', 'real', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'John', 'Bayley', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'appearance', 'remarkably', 'so', 'portray', 'couple', 'always', 'right', 'amount', 'humor', 'emotion', 'sensitivity', 'young', 'Iris', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'have', 'seen', 'prior', 'film', 'too', 'be', 'applauded.Had', 'Iris', 'Murdoch', 'been', 'portrayed', 'more', 'detail', 'writer', 'philosopher', 'woman', 'prior', 'Alzheimer', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'pleasing', 'dimension', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'movie', 'still', 'movie', 'out', 'message', 'tender', 'endurance', 'even', 'tragedy', 'loss', 'when', 'bright', 'mind', 'slowly', 'agonizingly', 'extinguished']",N/A
