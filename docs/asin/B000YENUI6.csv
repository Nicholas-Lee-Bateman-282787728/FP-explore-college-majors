1119409,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B000YENUI6,,"[3, 3]","It's now 2009, and you would think that we would learn from our mistakes when it comes to bad movies . . . uh-huh. These past years, we've been tortured by three family-friendly High School Musical films, poor comedies like The Love Guru, teenage garbage such as 13 Going on 30, sappy fantasies like Eragon, etc. But hey, at least many of the action films were good to watch. Even though I'm in my early 20's, I'm a bit saddened that today's generation has ignored many classic films such as The Godfather and 2001: A Space Odyssey. And come on, The Dark Knight is a great movie and all, but it shouldn't be the ONLY film to watch in your lifetime! However, there is still hope. We have seen excellent movies from 2000 to present. No Country for Old Men, Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Letters from Iwo Jima are just a few. One of them I particularly enjoyed watching straight through is Eastern Promises. It's not only one of the few films in this generation that's strictly for ADULTS, but it's also one of the two darkest and most violent thrillers of 2007 (right next to No Country For Old Men).This film starring Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts is a relief from all the politically correct films we've seen for some time. There are some downright disturbing stuff going on. Anna Khitrova (Watts), who works at a hospital, has been informed that a fourteen-year old girl has just died of childbirth. She finds the girl's diary and discovers the painful truth: the girl named Tatiana was part of a notorious Russian prostitution ring, and that the ones who are partly responsible are right here in London. Mortensen, Vincent Cassel, and Armin Mueller-Stahl play the ""thieves in law"" who try to make sure that the truth is never revealed to the authorities.And it's not only the plot that's disturbing. There are scenes in which blood and gore takes center stage (the infamous bathhouse scene, for example). And there are plenty of major plot twists (if you want to know what they are, then watch the film). Mortensen was perfectly cast as Nikolai. He avoids the ""Lord of the Rings"" typecasting and goes on to act with a very good Russian accent. Watts gives a lovely performance as Anna; I could see no one else playing the part. Cassel as Kiril looks to be someone you would love to hate at first, but when the film nears its end, you can't really tell if you really do. Mueller-Stahl as Semyon is definitely the one we would love to hate, and he does a hell of a job at that. The supporting cast have it down good, also, so no complaints here.The reason I watched Eastern Promises was because I have a deep interest in Russian history, culture, and mythology. This clearly exceeded my expectations. It's one of the best films of 2007. It's too bad, though, that some people of this generation won't be very pleased when they get a chance to see this, because it's so dark and disturbing. Well, it's safe to say that I admire the film, and I hope there will be another film this year that will be as stupendous as this one.Grade: A+",5,"""Forget any of this happened.

Butterfly which was the Peking Opera. This is not only Russian culture transplanted to England but mob culture, which is a subculture of a subculture. I think it's my existentialist underpinnings that draw me to that, the idea that we create our own reality through our culture and our art. We create a reality that seems as real as anything else, but in fact, it's quite transitory and is really a projection of our own creative will. And so, too, it is with this crime family and that we discover in EASTERN PROMISES."" -David Cronenberg.Fascinating, yes? Well summing up in in couple of sentences the story, a nurse (Watts) stumbles into the world of the Russian mafia in England after taking an interest in a patient that died in her hospital and the patients newly born baby. Things aren't often what they may seem. She means well, but is in over her head. Will good prevail? I wasn't bored for a second and there are a couple of nice surprises.*Great script.*Great cast...*Naomi Watts is wonderful. Also I like her Uncle. He's ""old school"". Viggo Mortensen is a very talented actor and he delivers an incredible performance as a Russian mobster. One of his finest. Viggo always prepares extensively for his roles, doing in depth research, immersing himself in the part. He actually traveled deep into Russia ""a couple of time zones east of Moscow, Saint Petersberg, and the Urals"" to a place called Yekaterinburg, located far from Western Europe and that ""feels quite different"". He met people and would sort of just absorb their ""Russianness"". If you never saw Viggo in previous roles you'd absolutely believe he is a Russian actor.*DVD contains great bonus material.Like many, I enjoy films that depict the underbelly of society and criminals. I'd have to say ""Eastern Promises"" is in the top 6-7 films ""gangster/mob films"" ever made -which is saying a lot. Some believe David Cronenberg to be America's greatest director of recent decades. This film certainly helps make that case.

Last year brought the Irish Mafia of Boston in `The Departed,' and this year has brought many other facets.  `American Gangster' brought a true tale of Black organized crime, and, now `Eastern Promises' gives us a take on the Russian Mafia in London.  Chillingly brutal, David Cronenburg, who also directed Viggo Mortensen in `A History of Violence' in 2005, nearly reinvents violence once again in `Eastern Promises'.At the beginning ruthless Russian mobster, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), has a rival's throat cut in a brutal opening scene at a barber shop.  Nearly simultaneously, a pregnant teenager, a mere child, arrives at a pharmacy seeking a prescription while hemorrhaging all over the floor.  She's taken to the hospital where midwife Anna Ivanova (Naomi Watts) delivers the baby prematurely as the mother dies.  Honest and caring in every degree, she takes a diary from the young mother's possession and seeks a translation.  At home her English mother and her Russian uncle, Stepan, keep her company.  At first Stepan refuses to translate the diary, which only leads her to restaurant owner, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), whose only son is Kirill.Keeping close to Kirill is a Russian Mafia driver, Nikolai (Mortensen) who doesn't take a back seat in the family business.  Kirill, who is gay, is both surly and affectionate with his recruit, but  Kirill is Nikolai's ticket to Semyon,  the mob boss.  Meanwhile, Anna startlingly discovers that the mysterious girl was a prostitute named Tatiana, one who makes several references to Kirill and Semyon in her diary.  Trying to discover the baby's true family, Anna tries to negotiate with the mobster family in exchange for Tatiana's incriminating writing.  Nikolai, although having a steely reserve, only shows us the surface, beneath which shows some compassion for Kirill's women in distress and some secrets of his own.Suspenseful and mercilessly violent, `Eastern Promises,' using spare dialogue and tight editing, gives us an unflinching look at the underground.  Included in the bloodshed is a confrontational scene in a steam bath, where a case of mistaken identity sets up Nikolai for the knife fight of his life.  All plot points come together as a turf battle caused by the initial killing and Nikolai's full initiation into the mob family come to a head.  Unforgettable for its brutality as well as its logistics, 'Eastern Promises' delves into the frozen hearts of some truly unsavory figures in organized crime.",5,"""Chill Factor""",1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,2555,"['trend', 'days', 'different', 'kind', 'gangster', 'adventure', 'Last', 'year', 'brought', 'Irish', 'Mafia', 'Boston', 'Departed', 'year', 'brought', 'many', 'other', 'facets', 'American', 'Gangster', 'brought', 'true', 'tale', 'Black', 'organized', 'crime', 'now', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'take', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'London', 'Chillingly', 'brutal', 'David', 'Cronenburg', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'History', 'Violence', '2005', 'nearly', 'reinvents', 'violence', 'once', 'again', 'Eastern', ""Promises'.At"", 'beginning', 'ruthless', 'Russian', 'mobster', 'Kirill', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'rival', 'throat', 'cut', 'brutal', 'opening', 'scene', 'barber', 'shop', 'Nearly', 'simultaneously', 'pregnant', 'teenager', 'mere', 'child', 'pharmacy', 'seeking', 'prescription', 'hemorrhaging', 'floor', 'taken', 'hospital', 'where', 'midwife', 'Anna', 'Ivanova', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'baby', 'prematurely', 'mother', 'Honest', 'caring', 'degree', 'diary', 'young', 'mother', 'possession', 'translation', 'home', 'English', 'mother', 'Russian', 'uncle', 'Stepan', 'keep', 'company', 'first', 'Stepan', 'translate', 'diary', 'only', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Semyon', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'only', 'son', 'Kirill.Keeping', 'close', 'Kirill', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'driver', 'Nikolai', 'Mortensen', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'family', 'business', 'Kirill', 'who', 'gay', 'surly', 'affectionate', 'recruit', 'Kirill', 'Nikolai', 'ticket', 'Semyon', 'mob', 'boss', 'Meanwhile', 'Anna', 'startlingly', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'was', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Tatiana', 'one', 'who', 'several', 'references', 'Kirill', 'Semyon', 'diary', 'Trying', 'discover', 'baby', 'true', 'family', 'Anna', 'negotiate', 'mobster', 'family', 'exchange', 'Tatiana', 'incriminating', 'writing', 'Nikolai', 'having', 'steely', 'reserve', 'only', 'surface', 'beneath', 'compassion', 'Kirill', 'women', 'distress', 'secrets', 'own.Suspenseful', 'mercilessly', 'violent', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'using', 'spare', 'dialogue', 'tight', 'editing', 'unflinching', 'look', 'underground', 'Included', 'bloodshed', 'confrontational', 'scene', 'steam', 'bath', 'where', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'up', 'Nikolai', 'knife', 'fight', 'life', 'plot', 'points', 'come', 'together', 'turf', 'battle', 'caused', 'initial', 'killing', 'Nikolai', 'full', 'initiation', 'mob', 'family', 'come', 'head', 'Unforgettable', 'brutality', 'as', 'well', 'logistics', ""'Eastern"", 'Promises', 'delves', 'frozen', 'hearts', 'truly', 'unsavory', 'figures', 'organized', 'crime']",N/A

1119413,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000YENUI6,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 4]","David Cronenberg is surely one of our very best directors.  He has a sense of visual style Terry Gilliam and Tim Burton might envy; and a willingness to explore the dark corners of human experience one sees in David Lynch - except that Lynch appears to do it simply out of an obsession with all that is perverse and depraved, while Cronenberg genuinely cares about his subjects, no mattered how tortured.  For an example of this try Spider, although Dead Ringers - even Naked Lunch - would serve just as well.Cronenberg secured his place at table with The Fly, a glossy, smart horror story about monstrous transformation.  The Fly is visually intoxicating, truly disturbing, and compelling because of the underlying humanity of its characters.  This formula set the tone for many pictures to come, and didn't really change fundamentally until History Of Violence - also starring Viggo Mortensen.  HOV plays like a straight gangster pic, however smart it may be.  (If you choose to watch it try to be absent from the room towards the end as William Hurt completely embarrasses himself.  Imagine your effeminate seventh-grade English teacher impersonating a mob boss.)In Eastern Promises Cronenberg returns to this approach but the result is far better.  This time the setting is London, with Russian mobsters providing the context.  I will avoid spoilers because some of the drama depends on surprise.  Let's just say that Viggo Mortensen presents an aura of ""cool"" unknown in any spaghetti shoot `em up known to me - including every Godfather picture - all 19 of them - and Goodfellas.  Compared to Nikolai, Mortensen, the spaghetti crowd is little more than a pack of wretched thugs in sharkskin suits lacking anything resembling morality or values, much less the ability to contain bestial impulses.  Their violence is ultimately thick headed, boorish, and pathetic.Nikolai, by contrast, moves with calm, detached deliberation.  He is aloof and genteel; you could chill your vodka in his hands.  Like any iceberg, you know there's plenty going on in the background - but he does not show his cards.  Mortensen deserves consideration at Oscar time.  Another way this movie trumps every spaghetti shoot `em up you've ever seen is that there is very little violence, but what there is, is so very personal.  Hollywood has long ago forgotten that guns render murder cheap and trivial by making it a detached act.  In Eastern Promises, if I promise to kill you, I will, and during the last moments of your life you'll be staring right into my eyes.  Cronenberg understands what most directors do not, violence only compels if one cares about the victim, and at the very least, understand the personality of the perpetrator.  Naomi Watts is a marvelous actress (remember Mulholland Drive - speaking of Lynch), I can't say she has much to do in EP, but what she does have she does well.

1119414,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B000YENUI6,Amanda Richards,"[48, 57]","I'm actually not sure how to describe this movie, but I'll give it my best shot. First of all, Viggo Mortensen is outstanding as Nikolai, a driver and enforcer for the Russian Mafia, and full time baby-sitter to Kirill, the wayward son of Mafia boss Semyon.  He's one cold, emotionless dude when he has to be, but has a human side that peeps out ever so often from behind that steely, chiseled mug.Vincent Cassel (Kirill) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (Semyon) are also extremely convincing, the former as a violent drunk and the latter as the charming and affable, but very cruel father.  Naomi Watts doesn't light up the screen and steal the show as she normally does, but it could be the depressing role of Anna, a midwife who delivers a baby for a fourteen year old girl who doesn't make it off the operating table.Anne Frank may have left a more famous diary, but the diary of the unfortunate young woman is so revealing that some people are prepared to kill to keep the contents from being brought to light.Fascinating in some aspects, such as the story behind the tattoos, and graphic in quite a few others, including a memorable scene with a totally nude Viggo battling against guys with linoleum knives, I found some parts a bit too long and drawn out, and some too predictable.Never-the-less, the acting, the casting and the intensity of this drama make it extremely watchable (if you like this movie genre), and although it isn't going to be one of my favorite movies, it certainly is worth mentioning here.Amanda Richards, December 9, 2007",4,The Trans-Siberian Affair,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,1545,"[""'m"", 'actually', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'describe', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'give', 'best', 'shot', 'First', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'outstanding', 'Nikolai', 'driver', 'enforcer', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'full', 'time', 'baby-sitter', 'Kirill', 'wayward', 'son', 'Mafia', 'boss', 'Semyon', 'one', 'cold', 'emotionless', 'dude', 'when', 'be', 'human', 'side', 'out', 'ever', 'so', 'often', 'steely', 'chiseled', 'mug.Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Kirill', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'Semyon', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'former', 'violent', 'drunk', 'latter', 'charming', 'affable', 'very', 'cruel', 'father', 'Naomi', 'Watts', ""n't"", 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'steal', 'show', 'normally', 'could', 'be', 'depressing', 'role', 'Anna', 'midwife', 'who', 'baby', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'make', 'off', 'operating', 'table.Anne', 'Frank', 'may', 'have', 'left', 'more', 'famous', 'diary', 'diary', 'unfortunate', 'young', 'woman', 'so', 'revealing', 'people', 'are', 'prepared', 'kill', 'keep', 'contents', 'being', 'brought', 'light.Fascinating', 'aspects', 'such', 'story', 'tattoos', 'graphic', 'quite', 'few', 'others', 'including', 'memorable', 'scene', 'totally', 'nude', 'Viggo', 'battling', 'guys', 'linoleum', 'knives', 'found', 'parts', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'too', 'predictable.Never-the-less', 'acting', 'casting', 'intensity', 'drama', 'make', 'extremely', 'watchable', 'like', 'movie', 'genre', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'certainly', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'here.Amanda', 'Richards', 'December', '9', '2007']",N/A

1119416,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000YENUI6,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Much like `A History of Violence', `Eastern Promises' opens with a brutal murder and closes with a sense of calm that is almost unsettling.  They both also sport fine performances by the entire cast, Viggo Mortensen delivering career bests in both films.  Speaking of Viggo, I personally took a while to appreciate what he did with his character in `A History of Violence', a film that I adored but a performance that I couldn't rally behind.  After watching the film a few times though I have grown to understand why he was praised so much for his performance.  His turn in `Eastern Promises' took me no such time to understand and support.  As Nikolai he commands every scene with his restrained dominance.  We'll get back to him in a minute.Another similarity to the aforementioned `Violence' is that both films are more a study how violence either effects out actions or dominates our thinking.  Both films are violent in scenes but subdued in most, delving into the way violence circles the mind as apposed to the body.  It's within scenes where mobster Semyon fingers the mere idea of committing a heinous crime that we see the true reality of `Eastern Promises'.  This is a world where violence is entertained on a whim and is used to solve any problem.The one main issue I have with this film is one of the things that has been lauded by many reviewers and critics; the script.  It's just not as impressive as I had anticipated.  There are a few holes I noticed throughout, things that just made no sense (like how the baby born in the opening scenes to a mother who was injected with heroine every day had absolutely no health problems) and it was these things that made me lose some of my admiration for the film.  Cronenberg directs the film masterfully, using the same sense of restrained rage he displayed in `Violence' and the cinematography is near perfect, but it's that pesky script that bothered me to no end while the film was running.  Steven Knight's screenplay just needed to undergo a massive tweaking.The performances are another story all together.  Naomi Watts (in a truly `supporting' performance) delivers warmth and courage and makes her character relatable to the audience.  We understand her values and viewpoints, and hopefully we agree with them.  Jerzy Skolimowski plays Stepan with a beautiful humanistic sense of loyalty and parental responsibility.  The mobster family is also portrayed masterfully.  Vincent Cassel is not an actor I'm usually impressed with, but here he adapts to his character well, and while his final scene is not entirely believable he manages to muster enough charisma beforehand to make it forgivable.  Armin Mueller-Stahl on the other hand is magnificent throughout, truly understanding Semyon and portraying him masterfully.  He creates layers around this man that peel away as his true intentions and personality comes to the fore.They all though play second fiddle to Mortensen's brilliant performance.  With every line he draws the audience further into his character, making Nikolai someone we want to know more about.  Much like Crowe's ravishing performance in `3:10 to Yuma', Mortensen says so much without really saying much at all.  He acts with every muscle in his face, letting us into his heart and soul with a glance in our direction.In the end `Eastern Promises' is a film I highly recommend.  It's not perfect, and it's somewhat of a step down from `A History of Violence', but it manages to deliver enough good to outweigh the bad.",4,Falls a little short of brilliance but manages to remain intriguing...,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,3510,"['Much', 'History', 'Violence', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'opens', 'brutal', 'murder', 'sense', 'calm', 'almost', 'unsettling', 'also', 'sport', 'fine', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'delivering', 'career', 'bests', 'films', 'Speaking', 'Viggo', 'personally', 'took', 'while', 'appreciate', 'what', 'did', 'character', 'History', 'Violence', 'film', 'adored', 'performance', 'could', ""n't"", 'rally', 'behind', 'watching', 'film', 'few', 'times', 'have', 'grown', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'praised', 'so', 'much', 'performance', 'turn', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'took', 'such', 'time', 'understand', 'support', 'Nikolai', 'scene', 'restrained', 'dominance', ""'ll"", 'get', 'back', 'minute.Another', 'similarity', 'aforementioned', 'Violence', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'study', 'how', 'violence', 'effects', 'out', 'actions', 'thinking', 'films', 'are', 'violent', 'scenes', 'subdued', 'most', 'delving', 'way', 'violence', 'mind', 'apposed', 'body', 'scenes', 'where', 'mobster', 'Semyon', 'mere', 'idea', 'committing', 'heinous', 'crime', 'see', 'true', 'reality', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'world', 'where', 'violence', 'entertained', 'whim', 'used', 'solve', 'problem.The', 'one', 'main', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'one', 'things', 'been', 'lauded', 'many', 'reviewers', 'critics', 'script', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'impressive', 'had', 'anticipated', 'are', 'few', 'holes', 'noticed', 'things', 'just', 'made', 'sense', 'how', 'baby', 'born', 'opening', 'scenes', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'injected', 'heroine', 'day', 'had', 'absolutely', 'health', 'problems', 'was', 'things', 'made', 'lose', 'admiration', 'film', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'masterfully', 'using', 'same', 'sense', 'restrained', 'rage', 'displayed', 'Violence', 'cinematography', 'perfect', 'pesky', 'script', 'bothered', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'running', 'Steven', 'Knight', 'screenplay', 'just', 'needed', 'undergo', 'massive', 'tweaking.The', 'performances', 'are', 'story', 'together', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'truly', 'supporting', 'performance', 'warmth', 'courage', 'character', 'relatable', 'audience', 'understand', 'values', 'viewpoints', 'hopefully', 'agree', 'Jerzy', 'Skolimowski', 'Stepan', 'beautiful', 'humanistic', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'parental', 'responsibility', 'mobster', 'family', 'also', 'portrayed', 'masterfully', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'not', 'actor', ""'m"", 'usually', 'impressed', 'here', 'character', 'well', 'final', 'scene', 'not', 'entirely', 'believable', 'muster', 'enough', 'charisma', 'beforehand', 'make', 'forgivable', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'other', 'hand', 'magnificent', 'truly', 'understanding', 'Semyon', 'portraying', 'masterfully', 'layers', 'man', 'away', 'true', 'intentions', 'personality', 'fore.They', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Mortensen', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'line', 'audience', 'further', 'character', 'making', 'Nikolai', 'someone', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'Much', 'Crowe', 'ravishing', 'performance', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'Mortensen', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'saying', 'much', 'muscle', 'face', 'letting', 'heart', 'soul', 'glance', 'direction.In', 'end', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'perfect', 'somewhat', 'step', 'down', 'History', 'Violence', 'deliver', 'enough', 'good', 'outweigh', 'bad']",N/A

A dead body has tatoos of stars on its knees and the Scotland Yard Russian expert says it is the mark of the Vory V Zakone, the Russian mafia, and means ""he will never kneel"".  We have been thrust into this world in the violent opening moments of the film, and soon Anna (Naomi Watts), a young Midwife of Russian descent working in a London hospital will find herself accidentally enmeshed in that same incredibly dangerous world.A tragic incident and good intentions cause Anna to cross paths with the violent villains of the Russian underworld, most especially the cooly enigmatic Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), ostensible chauffeur but obviously something much more lethal, the ebulliant Kirill (Vincent Cassel), explosive and unpredictable son of Semoyan (Armin Mueller-Stahl), patriarchal and genial restaurateur whose overt civility cannot completely disguise a sinister undertone that even the somewhat naive Anna recognizes.Ably directed by David Cronenberg with his usual invention, the look and atmosphere of the film is incredibly dense.  He takes us fully into this world, and he is greatly aided by the fine performances of his actors.  Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai has the presence of a coiled snake, wrapped tight and severely restrained and disciplined but ready to strike at any moment.  It is nuanced and subtle performance.  Cassell is fine as the troubled and dangerous son.  Naomi Watts can do no wrong for my money.  And Armin Mueller-Stahl is completely marvelous and chilling as a man of many parts, masking a ruthless pragmatist capable of anything.Cronenberg does violence with graphic cruelty, and there are several brief but harsh scenes with grisly detail.  The already famous fight scene in the baths with a naked Mortensen battling knife wielding assassins is a directorial tour de force.  But this violence glimpsed early on lends an atmosphere of menace and dread throughout the film that is appropriate.  The audience, like Anna, does not live in this world and once involved with it, reluctantly or not, fear is the order of the day.The film has a twist or two along the way, and the arc of the relationship between Anna and Nikolai is nicely done and makes sense to the story, yet we wish for more.  And it is perhaps an irony that adhering to the logic of the story and the world depicted results in the little something missing other reviewers have noted that somehow turns this from a classic to a very good film. A good story can read better than it plays. I admire the fact that the film kept its integrity and didn't go for an audience pleasing sell-out, and yet and yet...

Uses the same basic framework as Road to Perdition (another superb gangster flick) but only because its an ancient plot as old as drama itself: The triangle of old king, incomplete son & loyal soldier. The dissolute son commits an unforgiveable transgression that forces the aging king to sacrifice the steadfast soldier. Or at least attempt to sacrifice him since the soldier is so resourceful he gives everyone a run for their money before the end of the story. This version is beautifully done & perfectly cast. Viggo Mortensen is fantastic & very economical - not a wasted line or gesture. But the rest of the cast is just as good. Frequently the accents are a weak point of a film, but not this one. The accents in EP sound pitch-perfect & never waver. It also seems a lot of research was done & it pays off big-time, giving this movie a very creepy look. For a truly weird experience, try the Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopaedia, Volumes 1 & 2. Its a tiny glimpse into a totally alien & incomprehensible world. American prison tattoos are pretty scary, but the Russian versions are even worse, if that's possible. Anyway, EP features some of the best acting ever & some startling twists in the screenplay. There's also one of the all-time great  cinematic double-crosses when the Russian godfather sets up Viggo Mortensen's character by having him initiated & tattooed suitably just so he can be used as a sacrificial lamb/substitute for his son in a murder attempt. This film is actually a fascinating character study since there's only a small amount of violence. The threat of bloodshed overhangs the entire movie but its really used very sparingly & strictly for effect. There's never a single gun to be seen but these mobsters get their point across regardless. I gave this film 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the ending, which is unworthy of the rest of the movie. Its almost as if David Cronenberg couldn't bring himself to kill Nikolai off so he came up with an unsatisfactory ending that allowed him to live. Traditionally, the loyal soldier dies tragically at the end, heroic to the last. But did Cronenberg foresee a sequel or two? Hard to say.

He's one of those hit or miss directors ...or at least he has been. Swinging wildly between the obtuse and the flat-out bizarre, Cronenberg is a challenging film maker to say the least. From his pathetic beginnings as a short film maker to his wobbly movie length debut with STEREO (1969), Cronenberg's early repertoire is, shall we say, less than inspiring. But then he started having fun and came up with the head burstingScanners(1981), which got a ""cult"" label quickly attached to it. Then came the creepy and highly successfulVideodrome(1983) and -- my personal favorite --The Dead Zone(1983) starring a very young Christopher Walken. Even hisThe Flyremake was strange enough to entice most movie-goers. And who could forgetNaked Lunch(`nough said).But then Cronenberg seemed to fall off his success ladder. The staleeXistenZandSpiderwere completely uninspired and rehashed old themes. His attempt at a romantic drama in M. BUTTERFLY quickly flittered away with little to no notice from critics or audiences.It appears, however, that Mr. Cronenberg is now back on track with a set of successful films under his belt.A History of Violence(also starring Viggo Mortensen) was a strange beast but exceptionally well executed in 2005. And now with EASTERN PROMISES, Cronenberg has again hit pay-dirt.More of a crime-thriller, Eastern Promises has some great acting by almost the entire cast. Viggo Mortensen (The Lord of the Rings) has been singled-out by a few award ceremonies and I find this a bit unfair. Naomi Watts (The Painted Veil) does just as good a job as Viggo. Her portrayal of a pretty young London nurse trying to help an orphaned baby who's mother was killed by a Russian mob boss is excellent. And so was Vincent Cassel (Ocean's Thirteen) as the drunken and pitiful Kirill, son of the Russian boss. There's no denying that Viggo's Nikolai is creepy, dangerous and carries a pitch-perfect Ural-Russian accent, but his portions didn't stand out for me anymore than the rest of the cast.The extra features on the DVD are exceptionally interesting, telling the story of how Viggo researched his role, and the importance that Russian criminals place on body art tattoos (something very prevalent in the film).Perhaps it's the pairing of Mortensen and Cronenberg that makes the movies. With two highly praised ones now locked in, this duo seems to know what makes a film fly. Let's hope Cronenberg realizes this and keeps on with his upward success.",4,The Entire Cast Makes This Film A Success ...Not Just Viggo,1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,2519,"['Discovering', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'touchy', 'best', 'one', 'hit', 'miss', 'directors', 'least', 'been', 'Swinging', 'wildly', 'obtuse', 'flat-out', 'bizarre', 'Cronenberg', 'challenging', 'film', 'maker', 'say', 'least', 'pathetic', 'beginnings', 'short', 'film', 'maker', 'wobbly', 'movie', 'length', 'debut', 'STEREO', '1969', 'Cronenberg', 'early', 'repertoire', 'shall', 'say', 'less', 'inspiring', 'then', 'started', 'having', 'fun', 'came', 'up', 'head', 'burstingScanners', '1981', 'got', 'cult', 'label', 'quickly', 'attached', 'Then', 'came', 'creepy', 'highly', 'successfulVideodrome', '1983', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Dead', 'Zone', '1983', 'starring', 'very', 'young', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Even', 'hisThe', 'Flyremake', 'was', 'strange', 'enough', 'entice', 'most', 'movie-goers', 'who', 'could', 'forgetNaked', 'Lunch', 'nough', 'said', '.But', 'then', 'Cronenberg', 'seemed', 'fall', 'off', 'success', 'ladder', 'staleeXistenZandSpiderwere', 'completely', 'uninspired', 'rehashed', 'old', 'themes', 'attempt', 'romantic', 'drama', 'M.', 'BUTTERFLY', 'quickly', 'flittered', 'away', 'little', 'notice', 'critics', 'audiences.It', 'however', 'Mr.', 'Cronenberg', 'now', 'back', 'track', 'set', 'successful', 'films', 'belt.A', 'History', 'Violence', 'also', 'starring', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'was', 'strange', 'beast', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'executed', '2005', 'now', 'EASTERN', 'PROMISES', 'Cronenberg', 'again', 'hit', 'pay-dirt.More', 'crime-thriller', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'great', 'acting', 'almost', 'entire', 'cast', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'been', 'singled-out', 'few', 'award', 'ceremonies', 'find', 'bit', 'unfair', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'Viggo', 'portrayal', 'pretty', 'young', 'London', 'nurse', 'trying', 'help', 'orphaned', 'baby', 'who', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', 'Russian', 'mob', 'boss', 'excellent', 'so', 'was', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen', 'drunken', 'pitiful', 'Kirill', 'son', 'Russian', 'boss', 'denying', 'Viggo', 'Nikolai', 'creepy', 'dangerous', 'pitch-perfect', 'Ural-Russian', 'accent', 'portions', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'anymore', 'rest', 'cast.The', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'interesting', 'telling', 'story', 'how', 'Viggo', 'researched', 'role', 'importance', 'Russian', 'criminals', 'place', 'body', 'art', 'tattoos', 'something', 'very', 'prevalent', 'film', 'pairing', 'Mortensen', 'Cronenberg', 'movies', 'two', 'highly', 'praised', 'ones', 'now', 'locked', 'duo', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'fly', 'Let', 'hope', 'Cronenberg', 'realizes', 'upward', 'success']",N/A

1119430,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B000YENUI6,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[0, 0]","With Spider, then A History of Violence, and now Eastern Promises Cronenberg has explored duality or dual personality traits in the main character of each film. While Eastern Promises is the most subtle and least Cronenbergian of all 3, the exploration is still there and Vigo's character eventually, SPOILERS!, reveals that he is actually under cover. This character within a character is what he has been playing with for the last 3 films. While it is true that he has always done this with his films, the last 3 in particular do not rely on any sci-fi machinery, drugs, abnormal video signals, or the paranormal to induce such inner dualities. They are rather, just straight psychological explorations of their characters inner dualities and motivations. Naomi Watts, while the main protagonist and the driving force behind the films unraveling plot, takes a back seat to Vigo's amazing performance and intense scenes. Still her character has a touch of duality too, flirting with danger and sensing, perhaps, something good lurking in Vigo. She never finds out, as we do, that he is in fact working under cover. Despite her ignorance, she is still drawn to him and he to her. Ultimately she cares for the baby and goes back to her normal life. Vigo however, goes back to his undercover post as mob henchman, having risen in rank, overthrown his adversaries, and satisfied his real bosses as well. At the end he does seem to have the feeling of regret that he is stuck in a life he wishes he were not a part of. It is essentially the opposite of History of Violence. He is a good man, willingly acting as a violent man in this film. In History of violence he was a violent man who renounced that and became good only to have that violence revisit him. These themes are the crux of what Cronenberg is exploring. The details are there to hang these concepts on. Overall this is a great film but as Cronenberg films go it is a departure from his more visceral enigmatic works like Videodrome (my favorite), and Existenz, and Dead Ringers.Like I said earlier, all Cronenberg films deal with duality in his main character and how they themselves deal with the issues at hand. This new more subtle approach is a change for a more normal route but it is still good. The fly, was perhaps the most intense approach where the main character is completely transformed. In Scanners the main character jumps bodies. In Videodrome he looses his mind, and in Dead Ringers there are two twin characters with a psychic connection. In the Dead Zone the main character is transformed by an accident. And in  Existenz reality can not be trusted since the character or characters are in an artificial reality.Cronenberg is one of the few directors who consistently produces thought provoking films today.

I felt that the film had a carefully unfolding so that the viewer was never certain of anything except the moral character of the nurse played by Naomi Watts. Now this is a nice plot devise to have one character on whom the viewer can trust to make ethical decisions and thus it allows you to suspend judgment about all the other characters and try to sort out the puzzle pieces one by one as they are revealed.  Violence is not implied in the film, it is usually shown in full gore. Likewise the plot is not always obvious and the film pulls a couple of surprises on you. The film depicts the Russian underground crime families living in London, a group hardened by the Soviet Union realities and the hardships they endured in Russia. The acting is superb and I was glad to see that Vincent Cassel was included in the top billing with Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts since he had a very difficult role to play which he delivers with great power. Mortensen does a super job in this film for he plays a driver for a Russian mob family who gradually is involved in more violence and is allowed into the inner sanctum by Kyril, the mixed-up son of the Russian godfather.  The nude steam bath fight scene is as terrible as anything I have seen in a film in a long time but it was highly realistic and amazingly filmed, though I have to admit I looked away a couple of times because it was intense. Armin Mueller-Stahl is the actor who plays the elderly Russian godfather of the underworld family. He seems like a grandfather but his dark side is gradually revealed and Mueller-Stahl plays it wonderfully for he remains understated from start to finish.  The plot is carefully filmed so that the viewer is shown details, clues, and character flaws one at a time until a picture of what is actually going on begins to reveal it. The ending is not sentimental at all and whereas it resolves in the minds of the viewer what happens in the future, it is not necessarily a happy future for all.

1119435,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YENUI6,Chris Pandolfi,"[6, 6]","Many violent films have been made, but David Cronenberg is one of the few directors who can capture violence at its most raw and shocking. His newest film, ""Eastern Promises,"" depicts violence that's so brutal, I found myself ensnared in its grasp. For its heavy-handed subject matter and disturbing scenarios, this is easily one of the year's most engrossing films, an intense character-driven story of style, precision, and astonishing depth. Within the first five minutes, a man's throat is slashed while sitting in a barber's chair; already, we're anxious to learn what has happened, why it's happened, and what may come of it. There's a thrilling air of mystery to this film that pulls no punches, forcing the audience onto an emotional roller coaster of extreme speeds and perilous heights.Taking place in London at Christmastime, the story begins when a pregnant Russian teenager walks into a local pharmacy--she soon begins hemorrhaging and is immediately rushed off to a hospital. She unfortunately dies, but the attending midwife, Anna (Naomi Watts), is able to save the baby. She then finds the young girl's diary, and while she's unable to read Russian, she does find the business card of a Russian restaurant. Anna goes to this restaurant hoping to find some answers. She meets Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), the middle aged owner. Right away, something doesn't seem right about this man; while he is accommodating, he's also detached and monotone, as if he has something to hide. These impressions get stronger when watching him react to the girl's diary. Nonetheless, Anna does need someone to translate. She'd rather not rely on her Russian uncle, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski), who has an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time.As Anna's search intensifies, the more unsettling the truth becomes. As a godfather for the vory v zakone--a ruthless sect of the Russian mafia--Semyon is active in an underground sex trade, one that forces Eastern European teenage girls into a life of prostitution and drugs. Semyon's son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), is the family's enforcer, and his hotheaded arrogance is second only to his issues with his father. There's no question that he's a cold-blooded killer, yet it's quite possible that some degree of compassion is lurking somewhere underneath. When and where this side of him is revealed, I dare not say, but it effectively shows that even a member of organized crime is not beyond redemption.The same can't be said for Semyon, whose true nature is venomous and disgusting. This is probably why Kirill is friendlier with the driver, Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), a mysterious man aiming to become a full member of the vory v zakone family. A member shows his allegiance by getting his body covered with tattoos, the most important being a set of stars on both shoulders and both knees (a symbolic way of saying that he'll never bow down to anyone). According to a London detective, the tattoos of a Russian mobster tell a life story; I find this interesting, considering that the film's tagline--""Every sin leaves a mark""--is thrown into the mix.Nikolai's life gets complicated when he crosses paths with Anna, who continues to pursue the Russian girl-mystery even as it gets dangerous. One gets the sense that she and Nikolai have an unspoken, unconscious understanding between them, in which one can acknowledge the other as a person instead of as a label. This isn't to say that Anna is trustful or unafraid of Nikolai--her eyes give away the fear, regret, and pain of the entire situation, not the least of which comes from Nikolai's involvement in her life. But his emotions run just as high, as he finds his loyalties divided between the vory v zakone and Anna. It doesn't help that war is immanent with a rival mafia family, and it shows its ugly side during an especially uncomfortable scene in which Nikolai is attacked at a bathhouse.Weaving throughout the film is narration of the Russian girl, whose name was Tatiana (voiced by Tatiana Maslany); as she reads passages from her diary in English, both Anna and the audience get a much clearer picture of what happened to her and of just how horrible her circumstances were. At a certain point, Anna's affection for the baby grows strong, putting her life in even greater danger. It also endangers the life of her uncle, who understands just how dangerous a family the vory v zakone is. The more he translates from Tatiana's diary, the less comfortable he is letting Anna delve further into the mystery.For whatever it's worth, it was a mystery I couldn't help but delve into. ""Eastern Promises"" has the kind of magnetic power few films have; it's a harsh, brooding thriller of impressive character, with a thought-provoking story and top-notch performances. This is especially true of Viggo Mortensen, whose performance is so believable that he practically disappears into the role.

1119437,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B000YENUI6,C McGhee,"[1, 1]","Eastern Promises-A movie made, I believe, to rid Viggo Mortensen of his Lord of the Rings image. I feel he has been moving to escape this image since LOTR finished. With Eastern Promises he surely succeeds. He plays a wheelman (or does he?)for a Russian mob now based in London. His relationship with his Captain or the son of the big boss (played by Vincent Cassel of recent Black Swan fame) is purely self-serving as he, Viggo, wants to move up & become a full member of the family. The movie does explain why later on.He becomes embroiled in the lives of a nurse that works in the maternity ward of a hospital & a baby girl delivered from a young woman that was raped by the head of the gang. A recalcitrant Uncle of the nurse that pushes an old relationship with the KGB plays a small part too. There's a lot of male nudity in this one girls so if your wondering what Viggo looks like in all his glory this is for you but, even more very realistic violence. Lots of edged weapons & tools are employed in a very graphic manner. The blood & guts are the main remaining image by the end of the show.I should mention there is a thin love story here but as it doesn't really serve the main purpose of the movie it is left thin & not really convincing. I love Naomi Watts as an actress but her part in this is not really central I felt & was a waste of her talent. As a vehicle to shed Viggo of the LOTR image I rate this as a five star picture. As a complete movie I give it 3.5 stars. It could of been developed into a story as big as The Godfather but wasn't. The ending is cut-off unless they intend a sequel which is more than possible. I was really surprised when the credits rolled as I didn't think they were ready to finish the tale yet. I took a half star off for that alone. My wife was surprised too.Action movie fans will be thrilled by the first viewing of this & the small roles played by Law Enforcement are well done but there's too little of that. A better show the first time than a second viewing in my mind. (edit)I can now say I enjoyed the second showing more than the first. It is a nice look at Eastern mobs so Kudos for that.

1119438,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000YENUI6,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","Is it possible to take seriously a movie where the violent highlight is a vicious fight in a public bath? The fight requires, of course, that at least one of the male fighters be nude. In this case, it's the lead actor and there are no flopping bits that we don't see. Another requirement would be that knives must be involved so that we can get plenty of blood, along with wince-inducing moments when blades slice into back and stomach muscles. And for a coup de grace, what could be more ick worthy than a blade driven into an eyeball, with the crunch of the socket bone being shattered?The bathhouse fight in Eastern Promises may be exploitive, but it's one of the most exciting, stunningly choreographed brawls I've seen on a screen. More to the point, it tells us something about the kind of man Nikolai is. He's the man who survives, and he's a lot tougher, smarter, more resourceful and more violent than we may have thought...and that's saying something, since we've already watched him ""process"" a corpse for anonymous disposal. It involved removing the teeth and fingers using pliers and a snipper.Viggo Mortensen plays Nikolai, the driver, as he calls himself, for the head of a powerful and vicious gang of Russian mafia based in London. Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), the old man who owns the Trans-Siberian Restaurant, rules his criminal empire with guile and force. He is an aging man with white hair clipped short. He can be a friendly sort at times. He makes a wonderful pot of borscht. He plays the violin. He has daughters. He encourages his angels, his granddaughters, to learn the violin. ""You must practice more,"" he tells them. ""You must make the wood cry."" Semyon spends much of his time running drugs and prostitution. He brings in underage girls from Eastern Europe who think they'll be maids and waitresses, then imprisons them, hooks them on heroin, brutalizes and breaks them with rape and beatings, and puts them to work. One 14-year-old girl escapes. She can barely speak English. She's pregnant and hemorrhaging. When she dies in a hospital her baby is saved and her diary is found. Eastern Promises is going to tell us about Anna (Naomi Watts), the nurse who helped deliver the baby and found the diary; about Semyon and the lengths he will go to protect himself, his power and his son; and about the driver, Nikolai, the man Semyon trusts as much as he would trust anyone. We're going to learn more than we want about Kirill (Vincent Cassel), Semyon's son. Kirill is a weakling who likes to beat people, a drunk, a man who breaks in the frightened girls by raping them on his father's orders and beats them when he can't perform. At one moment he embraces Nikolai as a brother, another he forces Nikolai into humiliating acts. Kirill grovels for his father's approval and beats others when he doesn't get it.Eastern Promises is a fine movie, violent, complex and ugly. We're deep in London's Russian mafia, where violent thugs have tattoos that tell each other the story of their crimes, their murders and their imprisonments. Family is the only thing that counts, and even that becomes a repugnant concept. Moving through this is Nikolai, slab-faced, pale, calm to the point of being unnerving. When he seems drawn to Anna, we're never quite sure whether this will mean a degree of tenderness, or her death, or the death of the baby who has become a lever some would use against Semyon. ""I'm just the driver,"" Nikolai says.Through it all I was engrossed, partly with the world of these tattooed, dangerous men, partly with the subtle way David Cronenberg fiddled with my reactions and assumptions, and partly with just how good the actors were. Mortensen gave a stunning performance, down to his Russian-accented English, to his physicality and to the way he kept us off-balance with his intentions. Just as good was Armin Mueller-Stahl as Semyon. He has given us any number of wise old men to admire. Here he gives us a monster, opening layer upon layer of cruelty and betrayal. Mueller-Stahl just asking Anna with avuncular concern where she lives is able to raise the dread level with no effort at all.There is a twist that cannot be described, and which I wish hadn't happened. Even with that, Eastern Promises is a movie worth seeing and owning.The look of the film is just as tough and dark as the story. The DVD audio and picture are first-rate. The DVD has two extras. One, Marked for Life, tells us about all those Russian thug tattoos. It's short but interesting. And if you're of a certain age, you'll remind yourself to buy Cronenberg'sScanners(for your kids, of course) when you pick up Eastern Promises.",4,"Brutal and engrossing, and you'll learn how to use snippers to clip off a corpse's frozen fingers",1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,4651,"['possible', 'take', 'seriously', 'movie', 'where', 'violent', 'highlight', 'vicious', 'fight', 'public', 'bath', 'fight', 'course', 'least', 'one', 'male', 'fighters', 'be', 'nude', 'case', 'lead', 'actor', 'are', 'flopping', 'bits', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'requirement', 'would', 'be', 'knives', 'must', 'be', 'involved', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'plenty', 'blood', 'wince-inducing', 'moments', 'when', 'blades', 'slice', 'back', 'stomach', 'muscles', 'coup', 'de', 'grace', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'ick', 'worthy', 'blade', 'driven', 'eyeball', 'crunch', 'socket', 'bone', 'being', 'shattered', 'bathhouse', 'fight', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'may', 'be', 'exploitive', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'stunningly', 'choreographed', 'brawls', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'More', 'point', 'something', 'kind', 'man', 'Nikolai', 'man', 'who', 'lot', 'tougher', 'smarter', 'more', 'resourceful', 'more', 'violent', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'saying', 'something', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'process', 'corpse', 'anonymous', 'disposal', 'involved', 'removing', 'teeth', 'fingers', 'using', 'pliers', 'snipper.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Nikolai', 'driver', 'head', 'powerful', 'vicious', 'gang', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'based', 'London', 'Semyon', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'Trans-Siberian', 'Restaurant', 'rules', 'criminal', 'empire', 'guile', 'force', 'aging', 'man', 'white', 'hair', 'clipped', 'short', 'can', 'be', 'friendly', 'sort', 'times', 'wonderful', 'pot', 'borscht', 'violin', 'daughters', 'angels', 'granddaughters', 'learn', 'violin', 'must', 'practice', 'more', 'must', 'make', 'wood', 'cry', 'Semyon', 'much', 'time', 'running', 'drugs', 'prostitution', 'underage', 'girls', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'who', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'maids', 'waitresses', 'then', 'heroin', 'brutalizes', 'breaks', 'rape', 'beatings', 'work', 'One', '14-year-old', 'girl', 'escapes', 'can', 'barely', 'speak', 'English', 'pregnant', 'hemorrhaging', 'When', 'hospital', 'baby', 'saved', 'diary', 'found', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'going', 'tell', 'Anna', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'nurse', 'who', 'helped', 'deliver', 'baby', 'found', 'diary', 'Semyon', 'lengths', 'will', 'go', 'protect', 'power', 'son', 'driver', 'Nikolai', 'man', 'Semyon', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'trust', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'going', 'learn', 'more', 'want', 'Kirill', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Semyon', 'son', 'Kirill', 'weakling', 'who', 'beat', 'people', 'drunk', 'man', 'who', 'frightened', 'girls', 'raping', 'father', 'orders', 'beats', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'perform', 'one', 'moment', 'Nikolai', 'brother', 'Nikolai', 'humiliating', 'acts', 'Kirill', 'grovels', 'father', 'approval', 'beats', 'others', 'when', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.Eastern', 'Promises', 'fine', 'movie', 'violent', 'complex', 'ugly', ""'re"", 'deep', 'London', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'where', 'violent', 'thugs', 'have', 'tattoos', 'tell', 'other', 'story', 'crimes', 'murders', 'imprisonments', 'Family', 'only', 'thing', 'even', 'repugnant', 'concept', 'Moving', 'Nikolai', 'slab-faced', 'pale', 'calm', 'point', 'being', 'unnerving', 'When', 'drawn', 'Anna', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'will', 'mean', 'degree', 'tenderness', 'death', 'death', 'baby', 'who', 'become', 'lever', 'would', 'use', 'Semyon', ""'m"", 'just', 'driver', 'Nikolai', 'was', 'engrossed', 'partly', 'world', 'tattooed', 'dangerous', 'men', 'partly', 'subtle', 'way', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'fiddled', 'reactions', 'assumptions', 'partly', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'actors', 'were', 'Mortensen', 'gave', 'stunning', 'performance', 'down', 'Russian-accented', 'English', 'physicality', 'way', 'kept', 'off-balance', 'intentions', 'Just', 'good', 'was', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'Semyon', 'given', 'number', 'wise', 'old', 'men', 'admire', 'Here', 'monster', 'opening', 'layer', 'layer', 'cruelty', 'betrayal', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'just', 'asking', 'Anna', 'avuncular', 'concern', 'where', 'able', 'raise', 'dread', 'level', 'effort', 'all.There', 'twist', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'described', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'happened', 'Even', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'movie', 'seeing', 'owning.The', 'look', 'film', 'just', 'tough', 'dark', 'story', 'DVD', 'audio', 'picture', 'are', 'first-rate', 'DVD', 'two', 'extras', 'One', 'Marked', 'Life', 'Russian', 'thug', 'tattoos', 'short', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'certain', 'age', ""'ll"", 'remind', 'buy', ""Cronenberg'sScanners"", 'kids', 'course', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'Eastern', 'Promises']",N/A

Slipman,"[5, 5]","Director David Cronenberg follows up his notable flick, ""A History of Violence"" with a well edited tale of the London based Russian mafia, ""Eastern Promises"".  Shot around the streets of London, this dark and gloomily filmed movie gives off an air of danger and foreboding.The film commences as a young 14 year old pregnant Russian girl is rushed to the hospital where Naomi Watts playing Russian American Anna Khitrova works as a midwife.  The girl dies delivering a baby girl leaving behind a diary that when translated tells a pathetic story of rape, drugs and forced prostitution.  A business card in her possesion leads Watts to the Trans Siberian restaurant, headquarters of vory v zakone (mafia) boss Semyon played by venerable actor Armin Mueller-Stahl.Working for Stahl as an enforcer and driver is Nikolai Luzhin played superbly by Viggo Mortensen.  Mortensen expertly gives the aura of a tough, remorseless criminal never losing his authentic sounding accent throughout the film.  He is also the watchdog over Stahl's unstable son Kirill played by Vincent Cassel.  The heavily tattooed Mortensen does most of the heavy lifting for this mob but takes a liking to Watts who is drawn to Stahl as he coaxes her to allow him to translate the diary.  Stahl, all the while wishes to destroy the evidence of his dastardly deeds chronicled within those pages.The movie plays out with Watts and her family trying to protect the baby while Mortensen and Cassel carry out their criminal duties for their boss.  The movie contains many graphic displays of violence and bloody gore particularly in a sauna bath knife fighting scene which Mortensen plays in the buff.The not totally expected conclusion ties a nice bow around a supenseful and revealing film that had few if any dull moments featuring a well directed cast with succinct and purposeful dialogue and action.",5,Excellent expose of the Russian mafia,1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,1867,"['Director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'up', 'notable', 'flick', 'History', 'Violence', 'well', 'edited', 'tale', 'London', 'based', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'Shot', 'streets', 'London', 'dark', 'gloomily', 'filmed', 'movie', 'off', 'air', 'danger', 'foreboding.The', 'film', 'commences', 'young', '14', 'year', 'old', 'pregnant', 'Russian', 'girl', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'where', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'playing', 'Russian', 'American', 'Anna', 'Khitrova', 'midwife', 'girl', 'delivering', 'baby', 'girl', 'leaving', 'diary', 'when', 'translated', 'pathetic', 'story', 'rape', 'drugs', 'forced', 'prostitution', 'business', 'card', 'possesion', 'Watts', 'Trans', 'Siberian', 'restaurant', 'headquarters', 'vory', 'v', 'zakone', 'mafia', 'boss', 'Semyon', 'played', 'venerable', 'actor', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl.Working', 'Stahl', 'enforcer', 'driver', 'Nikolai', 'Luzhin', 'played', 'superbly', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Mortensen', 'expertly', 'aura', 'tough', 'remorseless', 'criminal', 'never', 'losing', 'authentic', 'sounding', 'accent', 'film', 'also', 'watchdog', 'Stahl', 'unstable', 'son', 'Kirill', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'heavily', 'tattooed', 'Mortensen', 'most', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'mob', 'liking', 'Watts', 'who', 'drawn', 'Stahl', 'allow', 'translate', 'diary', 'Stahl', 'while', 'wishes', 'destroy', 'evidence', 'dastardly', 'deeds', 'chronicled', 'pages.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Watts', 'family', 'trying', 'protect', 'baby', 'Mortensen', 'Cassel', 'carry', 'out', 'criminal', 'duties', 'boss', 'movie', 'many', 'graphic', 'displays', 'violence', 'bloody', 'gore', 'particularly', 'sauna', 'bath', 'knife', 'fighting', 'scene', 'Mortensen', 'buff.The', 'not', 'totally', 'expected', 'conclusion', 'nice', 'bow', 'supenseful', 'revealing', 'film', 'had', 'few', 'dull', 'moments', 'featuring', 'well', 'directed', 'cast', 'succinct', 'purposeful', 'dialogue', 'action']",N/A

He and Naomi Watts light up the screen in this film, as they are two of the best in the business. Vincent Cassel is also convincing in his role as the son of a crime boss. Basically, Watts is a midwife who is trying to do a good thing when she stumbles across some information that gets her tangled up with an underground crime organization. There are several shocking, emotional scenes, and enough plot twists - consistent with Cronenberg's earlier works - to keep you guessing and keep you glued to the screen throughout. If you are a fan of Cronenberg (or Mortensen or Watts, for that matter), you will like this film. Don't expect a bloodbath along the lines of Goodfellas or History of Violence, though. This film is all about the plot, with the backdrop of beautiful scenery and tension you could cut with a knife. This film will make you think, but it will not confuse you, either.

1119441,A51IK68MWKV5R,B000YENUI6,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[0, 0]","The plot of Eastern Promises isn't as important as its characters. Sure, a London midwife (Naomi Watts) finds the Russian-language diary of a teenage mother who died in childbirth -- hoping she can get it translated so she can the surviving family of the baby (who lived). And, yes, this search leads her to the door of Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), restaurant owner and head of the Russian mob, and his loose cannon son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel).But the real chemistry comes from star Viggo Mortensen, who plays their driver, Nikolai, as he tries to warn her off the search, since she is getting into dangerous territory. And Mortensen is the true star of Eastern Promises since it is really his story, and Nikolai's relationship with Kirill the center of the film. Mortensen delivers a riveting performance that kept me involved throughout the film, but after it was over, I had a conflicted response.The acting, especially from Mortensen and Mueller-Stahl (who I'll watch in anything), was terrific (though Watts, as the film's moral center, is given nothing to play), but the storyline just left me cold. It seems as if Eastern Promises was designed purely as a vehicle for Mortensen (ostensibly as a follow-up to his previous pairing with director Cronenberg: the highly successful A History of Violence), but with little thought given to an actual, interesting narrative. The ""plot twist,"" such as it was, felt arbitrary and merely muddies up an already confused film.(Nice work on the first death, though.

The mother left behind a diary, which Anna's uncle begins to translate.  It spins the tale of a lost girl, caught up in the Russian mafia, fed tales of glandour and eventually taken advantage of.  Anna has unkowningly immersed herself into a world of trafficking, rape, and murder; and her new acquaintance, Nikolai, embodies the worst of all of those.I've made the plot to be a bit melodramatic; although, to be honest, it is.  Who really cares, though?  I don't.  I started ""Eastern Promises"" expecting a good piece of entertainment, along the lines of its Cronenberg/Mortensen predecessor, ""A History of Violence.""  An hour and a half later (the time having flown by), I was amazed.  I got what I expected, and much more.A lot has been said of Cronenberg's directing; I won't go into that too much.  If by now you aren't familiar with David Cronenberg, then I can't help you.  I'm going to focus on the acting, because that's what drew me in.  Naomi Watts is quickly becoming one of my favorite talents; she can convey so much emotion with the utterance of a single word.  Armin Mueller-Stahl is a scene-stealer as always; his understated mob boss performance is not only believable, it's downright chilling.  Vincent Cassell is simply delightful as he hops from one scene to the next; you can't tell whether to fear him or pity him.The real reason you're gonna watch this movie, however, and let's all be honest here, is for Viggo Mortensen's performance as Nikolai.  He is chilling; he is downright terrifying.  I can see why he's nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor; if he doesn't get it, it will be a downright shame (though Mortensen, a truly gifted performer who seems to take his art rather seriously, probably won't shed any tears over the loss).  The fight scene in the steam room will go down as a cinema classic; perfectly choreographed, perfectly acted.  You see a bit more of Mortensen than you really want to--well, ladies, maybe you have a different opinion--but it's all for the sake of art.And that's what ""Eastern Promises"" is, after all--art.  Cronenberg, in my opinion, is one of the most artful directors out there today.  He perfectly navigates the cannal between a study of violence and an explotation of it.  ""Eastern Promises"" is definitely a study of violence; there are questions raised that get unanswered, but it's not Cronenberg's job to answer them.  He's just a director.  You, the audience, must decide the answers for yourself.  So don't watch this movie, or any Cronenberg movie, unless you're willing to do some thinking.

1119451,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B000YENUI6,D. Hartley,"[1, 1]","David Cronenberg's crackerjack neo-noir, ""Eastern Promises"" is at once a brooding character study and a highly atmospheric thriller, and certainly rates amongst the Canadian iconoclast's best work.Anna (Naomi Watts) is a London midwife obsessed with tracking down the relatives of a newborn infant, left behind by a 14 year-old unwed Russian who tragically dies on her delivery table. Intrigued by the Cyrillic scribbling in the dead girl's diary, Anna turns to her Russian-speaking uncle, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimosky) for translation. Stepan staunchly refuses, citing his ""old country"" superstitions and soundly admonishing his niece for ""stealing from the dead"". Undaunted, Anna follows her only solid lead, a business card for a Russian restaurant that she finds in the diary. Anna soon gleans that she probably would have been better off heeding her uncle's intuitive warning, because the diary reveals itself to be a very hot potato to some extremely dangerous and scary individuals. Before she knows it, she is pulled into the brutal underworld of the local Russian Mob.Viggo Mortensen delivers one of his most accomplished performances to date as Nikolai, the Siberian driver for a psychotic mob captain (Vincent Cassel) who is the son of a godfather (Armin Mueller-Stahl). It is amazing to watch how effortlessly Mortensen, Cassel and Mueller-Stahl disappear into character. These skilled actors make it easy to forget that they are in actuality American, French and German; you do not doubt for one second that you are watching native Russians, who live and die by the rules of ""vory v zakone"" (""thieves in law"", a strict code borne from the gang culture of Russian prisons).Screenwriter Steven Knight revisits some of the themes he explored in ""Dirty Pretty Things""; namely, how the various immigrant communities go about assimilating themselves (legally and otherwise) while still maintaining a sense of their native culture. (I think this is the aspect of the film that has some people drawing comparisons to ""The Godfather""). The only quibble I had with Knight's script was a ""twist"" toward the end involving one of the main characters that doesn't quite gel with the rest of the narrative.Cronenberg, who initially built his reputation on Grand Guginol excess, has slouched toward a lean, almost poetic style in recent films that he has nearly perfected in ""Eastern Promises"". For the hardcore Cronenberg devotees, not to worry; the director's propensity for viscerally ""shocking"" images and squib-happy bloodletting is still on display, but it doesn't feel gratuitous here; these characters live in a violent and brutal world, and it's par for the course. As per usual, Cronenberg slyly infuses some twisted black humor into the mix as well. One scene in particular, involving an attempted mob hit in a steam bath, featuring a fearlessly naked Mortensen and an unblinking camera, is an instant classic.",5,Blood and balalaikas,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,2914,"['David', 'Cronenberg', 'crackerjack', 'neo-noir', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'once', 'brooding', 'character', 'study', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'thriller', 'certainly', 'rates', 'amongst', 'Canadian', 'iconoclast', 'best', 'work.Anna', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'London', 'midwife', 'obsessed', 'tracking', 'down', 'relatives', 'newborn', 'infant', 'left', 'behind', '14', 'year-old', 'unwed', 'Russian', 'who', 'tragically', 'delivery', 'table', 'Intrigued', 'Cyrillic', 'scribbling', 'dead', 'girl', 'diary', 'Anna', 'Russian-speaking', 'uncle', 'Stepan', 'Jerzy', 'Skolimosky', 'translation', 'Stepan', 'staunchly', 'refuses', 'citing', 'old', 'country', 'superstitions', 'soundly', 'admonishing', 'niece', 'stealing', 'dead', 'Undaunted', 'Anna', 'only', 'solid', 'lead', 'business', 'card', 'Russian', 'restaurant', 'diary', 'Anna', 'soon', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'heeding', 'uncle', 'intuitive', 'warning', 'diary', 'reveals', 'be', 'very', 'hot', 'potato', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'scary', 'individuals', 'pulled', 'brutal', 'underworld', 'local', 'Russian', 'Mob.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'one', 'most', 'accomplished', 'performances', 'date', 'Nikolai', 'Siberian', 'driver', 'psychotic', 'mob', 'captain', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'who', 'son', 'godfather', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'amazing', 'watch', 'how', 'effortlessly', 'Mortensen', 'Cassel', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'disappear', 'character', 'skilled', 'actors', 'make', 'easy', 'forget', 'are', 'actuality', 'American', 'French', 'German', 'do', 'not', 'doubt', 'one', 'second', 'are', 'watching', 'native', 'Russians', 'who', 'live', 'die', 'rules', 'vory', 'v', 'zakone', 'thieves', 'law', 'strict', 'code', 'borne', 'gang', 'culture', 'Russian', 'prisons', '.Screenwriter', 'Steven', 'Knight', 'themes', 'explored', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'namely', 'how', 'various', 'immigrant', 'communities', 'go', 'assimilating', 'legally', 'otherwise', 'still', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'native', 'culture', 'think', 'aspect', 'film', 'people', 'drawing', 'comparisons', 'Godfather', 'only', 'quibble', 'had', 'Knight', 'script', 'was', 'twist', 'end', 'involving', 'one', 'main', 'characters', ""n't"", 'quite', 'gel', 'rest', 'narrative.Cronenberg', 'who', 'initially', 'built', 'reputation', 'Grand', 'Guginol', 'excess', 'slouched', 'lean', 'almost', 'poetic', 'style', 'recent', 'films', 'nearly', 'perfected', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'hardcore', 'Cronenberg', 'devotees', 'not', 'worry', 'director', 'propensity', 'viscerally', 'shocking', 'images', 'squib-happy', 'bloodletting', 'still', 'display', ""n't"", 'feel', 'gratuitous', 'here', 'characters', 'live', 'violent', 'brutal', 'world', 'par', 'course', 'usual', 'Cronenberg', 'slyly', 'twisted', 'black', 'humor', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'involving', 'attempted', 'mob', 'hit', 'steam', 'bath', 'featuring', 'fearlessly', 'naked', 'Mortensen', 'unblinking', 'camera', 'instant', 'classic']",N/A
1119452,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000YENUI6,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[1, 1]","How sad.Here we live in the Western world where dreams abound--the immigrant arrives from the home front, running from a situation in which he can no longer abide hoping that with a change in venue super-charged with new opportunities life will proffer that mythical cup of ambrosia.  The actuality approaches a bleakness that builds to a wave of silent paranoia.  Instead of that cornucopia fraught with starry-eyed promises, he discovers a microcosmic facsimile of the world from which he left, filled with some good--the bittersweet albeit confusing sounds and flavors of the familiar translated and assimilated within the confines of the new surroundings--but mostly bad--a recreation of the same infernally instinctual caste system the &eacute;migr&eacute; sought to initially avoid but robotically approaches like a moth to the flame.In the 2007 film ""Eastern Promises"", director David Cronenberg (""A History of Violence"" and ""Dead Ringers"") and screenwriter, Steve Knight (""Dirty Pretty Things"") explore the nature of this imbalanced seesaw of disillusion.  Setting their story in the London of various Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s, they imbue the film's overall ambiance with a distinctly Eastern European miasma that suggests a steamy blood-colored borscht filtered through the cold and quintessential gray pea-soup--a far cry from the shining yellow emission of Dick Wittingham's city whose fabled streets are reputed to be paved with gold.Swirling about in all this grittiness, float new Londoners of various assimilative degrees.  The pretty midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) serves as a shocked onlooker openly and vocally reflecting the thoughts and reactions of the unseen audience.  In the course of her work, she comes across the tragic Tatiana, a pregnant teen found hemorrhaging on the floor of a local pharmacy.  In failing to save the life of the ill-fated mother, she feels obliged to discover a family relation for the newborn child, the only clue to this a diary written in Russian that Anna has not the linguistic skills to translate.  A business card found within the pages of the journal, leads her to the formidable Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), owner of a red velvet Russian Tea Room clone replete with the homey music of ""Ochi Chernye"" and balalaikas that act as a cover for the operations of the criminal syndicate `vory v zakone' not unlike the facade of the Genco Olive Oil Company shielding the Corleones.And like the celluloid gangster family, Semyon boasts an heir-apparent to his throne.  Kiril, played with a wicked insecurity by French actor Vincent Cassel oscillates between party boy and hot-headed killer in a psychotic conglomeration of the Sonny/Fredo archetypes of ""The Godfather.""Best of all is Nikolai, Kiril's driver and aspiring vory v zakone climber, the taciturnly menacing Viggo Mortensen who flits along the fringes of a somewhat desired normalcy, flirting with Anna while fixing her motorcycle and cautioning her alliance with the steel-cored Semyon, yet wearing his gangster curriculum vitae on his body in a series of rank-stating tattoos and grisly actions that speak louder than his non-words.  Mortensen's performance borders on brilliant--I didn't think he could top his Tom Stall role in ""The History of Violence.""  Nonetheless, he does and does it well, particularly in two scenes where his nudity shows his vulnerability and empathy for the parts of his job that are distasteful to him and displays a primordial flare for survival that transcends the boundary of the typical action-packed fighting segment and becomes a strobe-lit sequence of the masculine form that suggests a sculpture in motion.  Cronenberg and Mortensen form a fascinating film-making alliance which I hope continues.Bottom line?  Director David Cronenberg teams up with lead actor Viggo Mortensen and writer Steve Knight to tell a tale of disillusioned hopes in the film ""Eastern Promises.""  Despite some gritty depictions of violence amidst themes involving the seedier money-generating operations of the Russian mafia, the combination of talents manages to balance the darkness with some light and generate an entertaining film with distinctive performances, especially in the case of Mortensen.

1119453,AC63924IPU3IS,B000YENUI6,"DKMI ""dkmi""","[0, 0]","I really liked Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" and was looking forward to this movie.  In some ways I was slightly disappointed.  There was a lot of buzz about this movie and Mortensen has been nominated for an Oscar for his performance.  He was really good in this movie, but the character doesn't have to show a whole lot of range.  He plays an on-the-rise member of the Russian mafia in London.The fact that the movie is set in London and involves the Russian mafia is rather unique, however, I couldn't help but feeling that I've seen these characters before.  The movie is littered with cliches.  Armin Mueller-Stahl plays a most likeable yet evil mafia boss.  Like movies such as ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"", the film portrays a mafia boss as a wonderful family man.  We're first intruduced to him as he prepares a meal for a family gathering in his restaurant.  Things are just a little too perfect.  You have the usual thugs keeping guard, and all these people arriving dressed up bearing birthday gifts and walking by the thugs like they were part of the furniture.Another cliche is the boss's son.  He's out of control.  Unlike his calculating father, he's reckless and everything he does jeopardizes the family.  He would have fit right into a story line in ""The Sopranos"".  He'd be the loose canon relative who the boss is always covering up for and the only reason anyone tolerates him is because of his family standing.Cliches or not, ""Eastern Promises"" is a decent movie.  The story about how Naomi Watts' character falls in with the gang is one of the unique things in the movie.  She's an outsider who unwittingly steps into the lion's den of the Russian mafia. Evil and violence are with us in every scene but aside from a few scenes, there isn't a whole lot of actual violence in the movie.  The last time I felt this in a movie was in ""Reservoir Dogs"".  People called it a violent movie but violence occupied only about 10 minutes of the movie.  When the violence is there, it isn't pretty.  It's painful.The end was refreshing for a Hollywood film.  The final scene was fitting for the story and will leave you with wanting to see what the future holds.  If you are a fan of Cronenberg's work, or Viggo Mortensen, you'll be satisfied with this film.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","I figure Aragorn would come storming down out of the pinnacle of Minas Tirith if he knew Viggo Mortensen made a movie like EASTERN PROMISES.  Tolkienesque this dark film definitely is not.  Yet Mortensen definitely impressed me playing a ""driver"" for a Russian mob family in urban London.  From his stoic, almost inhumane demeanor, to his extremely convincing Russian accent, this actor shows some serious range.Translating the Russian diary of a dead young mother who just gave birth to an infant girl is the catalyst to this powerful, yet disturbing, story.  The midwife caring for the baby (Naomi Watts) is looking for answers to the mother's past; her search brings her inside the Russian mob, to a family led by a soft-spoken, yet very calculating, patriarch (Armin Mueller-Stahl).  Mortensen is one of the family's enforcers, a man whose tattooed body tells the story of his life in Russian prisons--a man who must keep tabs on the patriarch's hot-tempered, hard-drinking son (Vincent Cassel is fabulous); yet as the story progresses, a special bond develops between the midwife and the enforcer.  The movie builds to a rigorous climax, and when it arrives, the gratuitous violence takes over.  (The bath house scene, where we get to see more of Viggo than we ever wanted, while grisly and brutal was still over the top.)EASTERN PROMISES shows us Russian culture as well as the ugliness of the mob with its cold and stark inhumanity (the young working girls are treated like chattel).  It's brutal, dark, often terrifying, yet all of it is thoroughly believable.  Not a feel-good movie by any stretch, but very entertaining and informative.  Aragorn might not approve, but I do.--D.

A first rate cast and a well-chosen London setting combine for a movie you can't take your eyes off of.When a 14 years old girl dies in childbirth in a London hospital, British-Russian mid-wife Anna (Naomi Watts) seeks out her family.  A card in the dead girl's diary leds her to the Trans-Siberian Restaurant, run by Semyon (a subtle Armin Mueller-Stahl), who just happens to be the local head of the Russian Mafia.  Anna's knowledge of the contents of the diary will place her and the new-born baby at risk.At the center of the story is Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), driver for Semyon and his drunkard son Kirill (Vincent Cassel).  Nikolai exudes a quiet, menacing charm, and a sense of purpose somewhat at odds with his junior status.  His additional duty as fixer of Semyon's problems brings him back into contact with Anna, the beginnings of a fragile relationship.  As betrayals pile up bodies and the lives of Anna and the baby hang in the balance, Nikolai will prove to be more than he seems.Mortensen is superb as Nikolai, the tattoed and ruthless career thief with a conscience.

Reminiscent in some ways of The Godfather, in its portrayal of a crime family, it is also the story of a young midwife, who is drawn by circumstances into their web, and Viggo's character, who lives in the moral quagmire between them.As a crime drama, however, it ultimately suffers from having this dual focus, as much as from the incredulity surrounding both stories, their wedding, and more importantly their development. Several potentially interesting themes are introduced in the course of the film, but none of them are explored to any satisfaction (the screenwriter and/or director seems to prefer jumping from one to another and using them as props for a few stylish scenes rather than treating any of them with the respect of someone with anything interesting to say), and in the end its hard to say what the film is really about.The characters suffer from the same sketchy profiling, and while most of the performances are very good (given what the actors have to work with), compared to a film like The Godfather, the people being played are drawn too superficially to resonate afterward. The Russian mob boss is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and yet goes against his character and chooses to sacrifice his only competent soldier to protect an incompetent son who is clearly dangerous to his operation. The emotionally weak, yet vile son, meanwhile, is provided no consistent, believable persona (to use the Godfather again, he is one minute Jimmy Caan, the next John Cazale) and seems to function almost completely as a catalyst for others to play off of; a counterpoint conceived to give evidence of, or reveal something about Viggo and his father. Then, there is the midwife, who is introduced as an important character only to be dropped midway through (when Viggo takes over) until she reappears in the end with all of her problems resolved, and we are then supposed to feel her emotional journey. The entire confrontation involving the four of them down by the river struck me as lame- everybody rushing from the hospital to the dumping ground in various disturbed and damaged states to arrive at a big love-in around a baby that only midwife seems to want. What a waste of Naomi Watts. Even Viggo (who is brilliant as the film's centerpiece) has no real character to work with. Think about it: Who is this guy, really, besides a quasi-moral bad ass? Part one character from other movies, part another, is what Cronenberg's people are; insubstantial at the core.... and the same is true for his stories.Cronenberg's latest efforts (this and History Of Violence) are a weaker cross between early Lynch (Blue Velvet), and a later-day Scorcese (The Departed), and if you enjoy those kind of films, you may like Eastern Promises. Perhaps like the The Departed, it is more easily appreciated as a Hollywood style hybrid of cross-genre realism, and stylish entertainment. 3 out of 5 for the most overrated director out there. A posturing,"" cool guy,"" Cronenberg plays with and mixes Hollywood stereotypes and clich&eacute;s (a la Tarantino, even Jarmush), but he doesn't always do it very well, and often to the detriment of other aspects of the film, its story, and its characters.Your cinewest correspondent",3,More hollywood unfulfillment,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,3397,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'people', 'extolling', 'virtues', 'mediocrity', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'held', 'interest', 'up', 'climax', 'baths', 'delivered', 'nothing', 'thereafter', 'Reminiscent', 'ways', 'Godfather', 'portrayal', 'crime', 'family', 'also', 'story', 'young', 'midwife', 'who', 'drawn', 'circumstances', 'web', 'Viggo', 'character', 'who', 'moral', 'quagmire', 'them.As', 'crime', 'drama', 'however', 'ultimately', 'having', 'dual', 'focus', 'as', 'much', 'incredulity', 'surrounding', 'stories', 'wedding', 'more', 'importantly', 'development', 'Several', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'themes', 'are', 'introduced', 'course', 'film', 'none', 'are', 'explored', 'satisfaction', 'screenwriter', 'and/or', 'director', 'prefer', 'jumping', 'one', 'using', 'props', 'few', 'stylish', 'scenes', 'rather', 'treating', 'respect', 'someone', 'anything', 'interesting', 'say', 'end', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'about.The', 'characters', 'suffer', 'same', 'sketchy', 'profiling', 'most', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'given', 'what', 'actors', 'have', 'work', 'compared', 'film', 'Godfather', 'people', 'being', 'played', 'are', 'drawn', 'too', 'superficially', 'resonate', 'afterward', 'Russian', 'mob', 'boss', 'wolf', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'yet', 'character', 'sacrifice', 'only', 'competent', 'soldier', 'protect', 'incompetent', 'son', 'who', 'clearly', 'dangerous', 'operation', 'emotionally', 'weak', 'yet', 'vile', 'son', 'meanwhile', 'provided', 'consistent', 'believable', 'persona', 'use', 'Godfather', 'again', 'one', 'minute', 'Jimmy', 'Caan', 'next', 'John', 'Cazale', 'function', 'almost', 'completely', 'catalyst', 'others', 'play', 'counterpoint', 'conceived', 'give', 'evidence', 'reveal', 'something', 'Viggo', 'father', 'Then', 'midwife', 'who', 'introduced', 'important', 'character', 'only', 'be', 'dropped', 'midway', 'when', 'Viggo', 'over', 'end', 'problems', 'resolved', 'are', 'then', 'supposed', 'feel', 'emotional', 'journey', 'entire', 'confrontation', 'involving', 'four', 'down', 'river', 'struck', 'lame-', 'everybody', 'rushing', 'hospital', 'dumping', 'ground', 'various', 'disturbed', 'damaged', 'states', 'arrive', 'big', 'love-in', 'baby', 'only', 'midwife', 'want', 'What', 'waste', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Even', 'Viggo', 'who', 'brilliant', 'film', 'centerpiece', 'real', 'character', 'work', 'Think', 'Who', 'guy', 'really', 'quasi-moral', 'bad', 'ass', 'Part', 'one', 'character', 'other', 'movies', 'part', 'what', 'Cronenberg', 'people', 'are', 'insubstantial', 'core', 'same', 'true', 'stories.Cronenberg', 'latest', 'efforts', 'History', 'Violence', 'are', 'weaker', 'cross', 'early', 'Lynch', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'later-day', 'Scorcese', 'Departed', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'films', 'may', 'like', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'Perhaps', 'Departed', 'more', 'easily', 'appreciated', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'hybrid', 'cross-genre', 'realism', 'stylish', 'entertainment', '3', '5', 'most', 'overrated', 'director', 'there', 'posturing', 'cool', 'guy', 'Cronenberg', 'mixes', 'Hollywood', 'stereotypes', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'la', 'Tarantino', 'even', 'Jarmush', ""n't"", 'always', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'often', 'detriment', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'story', 'characters.Your', 'cinewest', 'correspondent']",N/A
1119459,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B000YENUI6,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[1, 1]","This is a vicious, foreboding, but eminently watchable movie not recommended for the faint of heart. I came away from it with the impression that London had been moved lock, stock, and barrel to Moscow, so Russian is the overall cast to the movie. It opens with a particularly violent murder in a barbershop (I was frankly amazed that the ""victim"" couldn't see it coming) and segues to a waifish young girl in obvious distress who wanders into a drugstore and subsequently collapses, losing her life immediately thereafter giving birth at a local hospital. (I put ""victim"" in quotes because it doesn't seem that anyone involved here is totally free of criminal intent, other than the young woman protagonist and her family.)Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife at the local hospital, is working when the young girl comes in, and she finds an instant affinity with the baby girl left motherless when the mother dies on the table. Anna takes the one object that can identify the dead girl - a diary - home to her curmudgeonly Russian uncle to translate. The uncle, offended that Anna should take something from the dead, drags his feet about translating, and to speed things up (the baby will soon be put in foster care if relatives can't be located) Anna takes the diary - by way of copy - to a nearby Russian restaurant to be translated by the owner, a seemingly charming and cultured older Russian gentleman. Unbeknownst to Anna, the restaurant is a front for the Russian mob, and the diary is a particularly condemning bit of evidence concerning sexual slavery of young Russian girls that Semyon - the proprietor and Mob boss - would very much like to get his hands on. Consequently, Anna, with the best of intentions, draws the attention of the Mob and is put in high peril.To give her credit, Anna senses from the start that these are not nice people. The restauranteur's driver is played with chilling authenticity by Viggo Mortensen, who did extensive research (including an independent trip to Russia) to get the part right. He is cold, calculating, economical in speech...and the only person who can hold Semyon's loose-cannon son Kirill in check. Kirill is the nominal superior to Nicolai, Viggo's character; but really it is Viggo who is in charge, at least of Kirill (played with manic perfection by Vincent Cassel).This was a dark, gripping movie about the ruthlessness of the Russian mob, with very graphic violence and rather startling full-frontal nudity in a public bath as Nicolai fights for his life with two thugs bent on killing him. There is a fascinating scene also where several Mob bosses convene in a wine cellar to view Nicolai's prison tattoos - a visual history of his criminal accomplishments - to decide on elevating him in rank.There is the suggestion in released trailers that there is, perhaps, a romantic connection between Nicolai and Anna; but while they do form a partnership of sorts, there is little of romance here. I thought Naomi Watts played a good role as a strong woman trying to do right and knowing she is up against very tough characters; Viggo Mortensen played his usual spot-on characterization of a man on the edge dependent on his own wits to survive.",4,Russian roulette,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,3196,"['vicious', 'foreboding', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'movie', 'not', 'recommended', 'faint', 'heart', 'came', 'away', 'impression', 'London', 'had', 'been', 'moved', 'lock', 'stock', 'barrel', 'Moscow', 'so', 'Russian', 'overall', 'cast', 'movie', 'particularly', 'violent', 'murder', 'barbershop', 'was', 'frankly', 'amazed', 'victim', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'waifish', 'young', 'girl', 'obvious', 'distress', 'who', 'drugstore', 'subsequently', 'collapses', 'losing', 'life', 'immediately', 'thereafter', 'giving', 'birth', 'local', 'hospital', 'put', 'victim', 'quotes', ""n't"", 'seem', 'anyone', 'involved', 'here', 'totally', 'free', 'criminal', 'intent', 'other', 'young', 'woman', 'protagonist', 'family', 'Anna', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'midwife', 'local', 'hospital', 'working', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'instant', 'affinity', 'baby', 'girl', 'left', 'motherless', 'when', 'mother', 'table', 'Anna', 'one', 'object', 'can', 'identify', 'dead', 'girl', 'diary', 'home', 'curmudgeonly', 'Russian', 'uncle', 'translate', 'uncle', 'offended', 'Anna', 'should', 'take', 'something', 'dead', 'drags', 'feet', 'translating', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'baby', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'put', 'foster', 'care', 'relatives', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'located', 'Anna', 'diary', 'way', 'copy', 'nearby', 'Russian', 'restaurant', 'be', 'translated', 'owner', 'seemingly', 'charming', 'cultured', 'older', 'Russian', 'gentleman', 'Unbeknownst', 'Anna', 'restaurant', 'front', 'Russian', 'mob', 'diary', 'particularly', 'condemning', 'bit', 'evidence', 'concerning', 'sexual', 'slavery', 'young', 'Russian', 'girls', 'Semyon', 'proprietor', 'Mob', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'get', 'hands', 'Consequently', 'Anna', 'best', 'intentions', 'attention', 'Mob', 'put', 'high', 'peril.To', 'give', 'credit', 'Anna', 'start', 'are', 'not', 'nice', 'people', 'restauranteur', 'driver', 'played', 'chilling', 'authenticity', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'who', 'did', 'extensive', 'research', 'including', 'independent', 'trip', 'Russia', 'get', 'part', 'right', 'cold', 'calculating', 'economical', 'speech', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'Semyon', 'loose-cannon', 'son', 'Kirill', 'check', 'Kirill', 'nominal', 'superior', 'Nicolai', 'Viggo', 'character', 'really', 'Viggo', 'who', 'charge', 'least', 'Kirill', 'played', 'manic', 'perfection', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', '.This', 'was', 'dark', 'gripping', 'movie', 'ruthlessness', 'Russian', 'mob', 'very', 'graphic', 'violence', 'rather', 'startling', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'public', 'bath', 'Nicolai', 'fights', 'life', 'two', 'thugs', 'bent', 'killing', 'fascinating', 'scene', 'also', 'where', 'several', 'Mob', 'bosses', 'convene', 'wine', 'cellar', 'view', 'Nicolai', 'prison', 'tattoos', 'visual', 'history', 'criminal', 'accomplishments', 'decide', 'elevating', 'rank.There', 'suggestion', 'released', 'trailers', 'perhaps', 'romantic', 'connection', 'Nicolai', 'Anna', 'do', 'form', 'partnership', 'sorts', 'little', 'romance', 'here', 'thought', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'played', 'good', 'role', 'strong', 'woman', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'knowing', 'up', 'very', 'tough', 'characters', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'played', 'usual', 'spot-on', 'characterization', 'man', 'edge', 'dependent', 'own', 'wits', 'survive']",N/A
1119460,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000YENUI6,Galina,"[2, 2]","""Eastern promises"" is the first film for David Cronenberg that was shot entirely outside his native Canada and it is the second film of Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen - after ""The History of Violence"" (2005). It should be mentioned that Viggo Mortensen had done a very impressive research for his Oscar-nominated role of Nikolai Luzhin, a modest driver and also an ""undertaker"" and a hit-man for the Russian mafia boss in London. Mortensen alone, without a translator, had traveled across Russia, visiting the Urals Mountains where his character came from, and also stopped in Moscow and St.-Petersburg. Mortensen diligently learned Russian to make the Russian phrases of Siberian Nikolai sound more naturally. He also studied the literature on Russian prisons and their unofficial kings, ""vory v zakone"" or thieves in the law, the most respected and feared criminals. The script was written by Stephen Knight whose previous film on the subject of the emigrants in modern London, ""Dirty Pretty Things"" (2002), proves that he is a talented writer. Sadly, the script is the weakest part of ""Eastern Promises"" and while watching the movie I thought that it had deserved the better writing. The story is predictable from the very beginning and it lacks subtlety. All twists and turns are clearly seen a mile away. Even with the obvious problems in the script, ""Eastern promises"" is an interesting film - intense, gloomy, dark, and violent. David Cronenberg's directing is laconic, non sentimental, almost clinical and always virtuoso. The gruesome fight scene in the Turkish Baths is a masterpiece, the way it was choreographed and shot. Cronenberg must have used the knowledgeable Russian consultants on the set and I was pleasantly surprised that the Russian phrases sound naturally, and pronunciation and intonations of the non-Russian actors were believable. Besides Mortinsen, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vincent Casselas as Nikolai's horrifying boss and his creepy son, are especially memorable. Surprisingly, Naomi Watts whom I adore in every movie I've seen her, plays the least interesting character and I attribute it to the weaknesses of the script.3.5/5 or 7/10",3,"""I am driver.

1119462,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000YENUI6,General Zombie,"[1, 1]","David Cronenberg's career has been one of the most unusual among prominent directors. After a decade of making highly novel and intellectual horror films Cronenberg flirted with the mainstream in ""The Fly"" and ""Dead Ringers"" before retreating into a bizarre third phase marked by adaptations of seemingly unfilmable material in the forms of ""Naked Lunch"" and ""Crash."" With ""A History of Violence"" Cronenberg opened the fourth phase of his career and took one more stab at a conventional narrative. Of course, ""A History of Violence"" is a far more unusual thriller than it may initially appear, and the same can be said of his follow up ""Eastern Promises."" Eastern Promises"" is ultimately not as striking or as distinct as the aforementioned film, but it provides further evidence that the controlled, idea-oriented Cronenberg can (with assistance from screenwriter Knight) craft a more human drama, and can still place a distinct stamp on a convention-dominated genre.""Eastern Promises"" explores Russian-run organized crime in modern day London, opening when a young prostitute Tatiana (Sarah Jeanne Labrosse) dies during childbirth, and her nurse Anna (Naomi Watts), a second generation Anglo-Russian, discovers Tatiana's tragedy-filled diary. Anna takes it upon herself to place the child with the girl's relatives, and her investigations lead her to Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a seemingly helpful elderly Russian man who is soon revealed to be a powerful mobster with good reason to hide Tatiana's story. Simultaneously we glimpse into the core of the mafia while following the day-to-day lives of Kirill (Vincent Cassel), Semyon's haughty, self-absorbed son who constantly causes trouble and the cool, detached Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), Kirill's friend and an up and coming ""driver"" within Semyon's organization. Nikolai soon notices Anna's investigations and, after first trying to warn her away, becomes personally involved, even at the risk to his place in the organization.Though that synopsis suggests a crime/thriller film, ""Eastern Promises"" is substantially more staid than that, playing more as a straight drama set in the mafia's world. Though punctuated by moments of striking violence, the film is more obsessed with character and sorrowful mood, and Cronenberg cuts down on his an ace visuals to create a wintry London locale that is a flat, desolate place, wholly appropriate to the somber nature of the narrative. Moreover, ""Eastern Promises"" takes a more classically-styled approach to character than most recent mafia pics. While modern cinematic mobsters are typically mundane, bestial or neurotic, the brass of the Russian mafia here display a sort of self-regarding, aristocratic air even as they commit the basest crimes. The film's greatest strength is in the depth of the characters, most of whom initially appear to be standard types, but who grow to be more sophisticated as the film progresses. Particularly notable is Kirill, who is so tiresome and whiny at first, but who finally displays a surprising humanity, especially compared to his cold, business-like compatriots. (Cassel has long specialized in playing self-absorbed French punks, and he makes the transition to self-absorbed, Russian punk effortlessly.)Watts and Mortensen make up the heart of the film. Though Watts's Anna is somewhat thinly written, she is the film's line to the real world, the shocked innocent who finds that a dark, unseen underworld surrounds us all. Conversely, Mortensen's mysterious Nikolai may seem to be nothing more than the mobster with a heart of gold, but his commanding presence dominates the film. Some are dissatisfied with his accent, but I fear that Russian accents are naturally goofy, and Mortensen's pure physical presence, with his dark glasses and slicked hair, generates cool aloofness. He is, however, a deeply sympathetic character who takes great personal risk for no personal benefit. In short, Nikolai displays the mix of detachment and self-control underlined by altruism/honor that marks so many classic heroes.If ""Eastern Promises"" has a weakness, it is the thinness of the story. Even though Tatiana's story has wide-ranging impact on the mafia, by the film's end it still feels as if we've barely scratched the surface. The later acts are highly compelling, especially Nikolai's deservedly famous, audacious naked brawl in a public bathhouse, but the viewer can't help but feel that there is more to be uncovered. (Of course, this weakness is arguably a testament to the film's effect as well, as few movies seem to demand that they be longer and more elaborate, but the slight let down exists nevertheless.)Still, that minor caveat aside, this is a distinctive, if not utterly unique, film and among Cronenberg's finest. He is known for his transformations, but I hope Cronenberg sticks with this approach for a little bit longer, as quality crime pics are in short supply, and he has the track record to bolster those standards quite a bit.

Maintaining his keen eye for the dark side of life and the people who dwell in its shadows, Cronenberg has once again brought us characters so strongly etched on film that they will be remembered for many years.The setting is London where lives the enigmatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen in an Oscar caliber performance) who serves as a driver for a cloaked mysterious Russian family, members of the Russian mafia called the Vory V Zakone, a bizarre brotherhood populated with men whose lives of crime are told in tattooed stories on their bodies.  The head of the family is the elegant restaurateur Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) whose son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) carries on the crime aspects of the family but shows no role of leadership in his dissipated life style.  As the film opens we observe the birth of a little girl to a drug-addled mother Tatiana (Sarah-Jeanne Labrosse): she dies during childbirth having been delivered by a midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) who herself has a history of a stillborn child.  Anna finds a diary in Tatiana's purse, saves it, and takes it to her uncle to translate it form the Russian.  Opening the diary opens dark secrets for Semyon and Kirill: Tatiana was apparently one of the many illegal Russian prostitutes imported by the Vory V Zakone crime syndication and was raped by Semyon whose daughter was born as Tatiana died.  Anna's investigation as to the baby's heritage includes the invaluable help of Nikolai who despite his past has a soft spot for Anna and her plight and it is the manner in which the interplay of Anna, Semyon, Kirill and Nikolai works out that brings the film to its conclusion.The acting is impeccable with Mortensen, Watts, Cassell, and Mueller-Stahl at peak form. Cameo roles by Sin&eacute;ad Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski, among others, are fully fleshed. The accents are believable and the multiple tattoos on Mortensen's body (seen fully in the much ballyhooed bathhouse scene, more about killing than about voyeurism) match the dark, dank atmosphere well captured by the cinematographer Peter Suschitzky and echoed with the musical score by Howard Shore. This is a tough movie for the squeamish to watch, but the story is superb and the film is Cronenberg at his best.

Kirill's father is Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), the seemingly avuncular but cold-hearted and ruthless mob boss who runs a drugs, contraband and prostitution racket from his London restaurant. Nikolai is initially little more than a babysitter to the wayward, drunken Kirill, but proves his usefulness to Semyon and seems destined to rise up through the ranks of the organisation.The film's opening scene sees a young, heavily pregnant girl collapse in a chemist's shop. She is rushed to hospital where she dies in childbirth. The midwife, Anna (Naomi Watts), who has recently lost a child herself, decides to try and trace the girl's family. The only clue the dead girl leaves behind is her diary, which is in Russian. Anna, unable to read the girl's words and finding a card in the diary, pays a fateful visit to the Trans-Siberian restaurant. Semyon seems initially charming and helpful, but after she tells him about the child and the diary, arouses Anna's suspicions when he firstly tries to find out where she lives and then visits her at the hospital. Meanwhile Anna's Russian uncle, Stepa (Jerzy Skolimowsky), has translated enough of the diary to discover that the girl was a 14-year-old prostitute, and that she was being kept as a slave by the mob.Anna's attempts to save the child, whom she has christened Christine, from a bleak future draw her inextricably into conflict with Semyon, and events seem to be heading to a fatal conclusion. Nikolai, sent to retrieve the diary, initially seems as sinister and cold-blooded as his boss, but reveals occasional glimpses of compassion which intrigue Anna.Viggo Mortensen is outstanding as the enigmatic Nikolai, whose real identity remains tantalisingly out of reach. Watts' performance as a woman trying to heal her own past by giving Christine a future, is subtle and understated, but as compelling as always. Writer Stephen Knight (Dirty Pretty Things) shows us a London that is cold, bleak and dangerous. The film gives us a fascinating insight into the Russian mafia or ""vory v zakone"" (thieves in law), who record their histories by tattooing their bodies. The violence is, as ever with Cronenberg, extreme but sparse - and all the more shocking for it. One memorable scene sees a nude Mortensen fighting two Chechen hitmen in a public bathhouse, which leads to a gruesome denouement.Eastern Promises is a provocative and intelligent thriller - it's not for the squeamish, but among the best films of recent years, and one of David Cronenberg's finest films to date.",4,Buried under the soil of Russia,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,2661,"['Nikolai', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'driver', 'Russian', 'mobster', 'Kirill', 'Vincent', 'Cassell', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'darkly', 'excellent', 'thriller', 'Kirill', 'father', 'Semyon', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'seemingly', 'avuncular', 'cold-hearted', 'ruthless', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'drugs', 'contraband', 'prostitution', 'racket', 'London', 'restaurant', 'Nikolai', 'initially', 'little', 'more', 'babysitter', 'wayward', 'drunken', 'Kirill', 'usefulness', 'Semyon', 'destined', 'rise', 'up', 'ranks', 'organisation.The', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'young', 'heavily', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'collapse', 'chemist', 'shop', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'where', 'childbirth', 'midwife', 'Anna', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'child', 'try', 'trace', 'girl', 'family', 'only', 'dead', 'girl', 'leaves', 'diary', 'Russian', 'Anna', 'unable', 'read', 'girl', 'words', 'finding', 'card', 'diary', 'fateful', 'visit', 'Trans-Siberian', 'restaurant', 'Semyon', 'initially', 'charming', 'helpful', 'child', 'diary', 'Anna', 'suspicions', 'when', 'firstly', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'then', 'hospital', 'Meanwhile', 'Anna', 'Russian', 'uncle', 'Stepa', 'Jerzy', 'Skolimowsky', 'translated', 'enough', 'diary', 'discover', 'girl', 'was', '14-year-old', 'prostitute', 'was', 'being', 'kept', 'slave', 'mob.Anna', 'attempts', 'save', 'child', 'whom', 'christened', 'Christine', 'bleak', 'future', 'inextricably', 'conflict', 'Semyon', 'events', 'seem', 'be', 'heading', 'fatal', 'conclusion', 'Nikolai', 'sent', 'retrieve', 'diary', 'initially', 'sinister', 'cold-blooded', 'boss', 'occasional', 'glimpses', 'compassion', 'intrigue', 'Anna.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'outstanding', 'enigmatic', 'Nikolai', 'real', 'identity', 'tantalisingly', 'reach', 'Watts', 'performance', 'woman', 'trying', 'heal', 'own', 'past', 'giving', 'Christine', 'future', 'subtle', 'understated', 'as', 'compelling', 'always', 'Writer', 'Stephen', 'Knight', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'London', 'cold', 'bleak', 'dangerous', 'film', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'vory', 'v', 'zakone', 'thieves', 'law', 'who', 'record', 'histories', 'tattooing', 'bodies', 'violence', 'ever', 'Cronenberg', 'extreme', 'sparse', 'more', 'shocking', 'One', 'memorable', 'scene', 'nude', 'Mortensen', 'fighting', 'two', 'Chechen', 'hitmen', 'public', 'bathhouse', 'gruesome', 'denouement.Eastern', 'Promises', 'provocative', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'not', 'squeamish', 'best', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'one', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'finest', 'films', 'date']",N/A

(Can't claim that I know much about this company.)What an odd tribe! What strange customs! And who could say that EEC doesn't work!The plot is gripping (has been summarized by others here, no need to repeat), the characters are not entirely new (some similarities in Italy and the US perhaps?), maybe one could see a structural parallel to 'Road to Perdition' (i.e. Mueller-Stahl as Newman, Cassel as Craig, Mortensen as Hanks). But I won't say more so as not to give away the suspense. Just one hint: Jude Law is not in it.His position is taken by two no-name leathermen with crooked knives, who can't get the job done.And yes, nearly forgot: Naomi Watts is also there, not a bad show.I wonder how a Russian would see the movie. Any comments from a Russian reader here?I did get an idea what a Russian audience would say. I watched the movie in a copy taken in a Russian cinema. Once in a while, the audience laughed. Two such laughing moments were particularly surprising. One was when a man gets a knife in his eye. Ok, that may count as funny in some places. The other one was when the Russian uncle of the Naomi character, played by a Pole (Jerzy Skolimowski), spoke Russian to one of the gangsters. That seems to have sounded hilarious.But oddly, nobody laughed when the Dane or the Frenchman spoke Russian. That either means, that Viggo and Cassel did a great job at learning the language, or that they were beyond funny. Cross cultural communication never ceases to provide suprises.P.S. after comments on the level of the spoken Russian I must acknowledge that the movie is a failure in some respects.

Prostitution, essentially of girls under age, drugs essentially as the fodder of the prostituted girls, alcoholism, violence, crime, any kind of trafficking provided it pays. The absolute impotence of the police or any authorities to stop it or prevent it is fascinating, and we may even think the absence of desire to do anything on their side might be a sign of fear. These networks of underground criminal organizations can only be endangered from the inside and the only who can get into these networks are Russians working for the ex-KGB. And that's the whole film. How does a KGB mole infiltrate such a network? The answer is slowly and the second answer is with a little bit of blood, shed by the English police if possible, I mean blood from the Russian criminals not of course blood from the English police. The film is full of suspense but without any suspense really because we know who is who, even if the people in the film do not know who is who. The suspense is in the details of the tricks, of the treachery, of the gore and of the horror each crime creates and calls for. The Chechens are sure seen as barbaric monsters but the Russians are not really better except that they do speak, and not only Russian. The end is a fairy tale because it is the victory of the good within the camp of the bad. It is Jesus becoming the head of the Roman Legion in Jerusalem. Will the Roman ensigns be planted within the walls of Jerusalem or not? Or if you prefer John the Baptist becoming Ponce Pilate. You can be sure there would be a lot of new converts. And what about Salome becoming the High Priest of the Temple? That's the trick used by Cronenberg. The film is a sad and pitiful if not pitiless pathetic vignette on the Russia mafia in Europe, since Europe has opened its boarders to the East and yet the ending is a twist in the fabric, a pirouette between two pas de deux and nothing has changed except that a king is dead and another kind is alive? Long live the new King. Louis XVI has become Robespierre. Charles I is now Oliver Cromwell. What can come out of such a crazy upside down situation? A big mess till some politicians really have the courage to say that will do and to stamp down on these cockroaches, even if it costs a few lives on the security forces' side. So far no one dares say a word, or nearly no one, because these perambulating shadowy mafias are either the descendants of the poor victims of the KGB, or the descendants of the poor victims of Ceausescu, or the members of an ethnic group that has made it a living style and an income to remain in the margin of society and suck all they can from the those who have to get up in the morning, go to work, work and then come back in the evening. It is truly a great way of life to get up after noon, do nothing up to night fall and then spend the night playing the guitar, smoking, drinking, and now and then going on a foraging trip into some deserted areas. Scrap metal is going up very fast at the present moment. By the way if these have a heart attack in the middle of their nighttime pleasures they expect public hospitals to give them freely and free of charge the best treatment they have at their disposal, and they, the nighttime revelers, deserve obviously due to the astronomically high level of contributions they have paid all along. Have you read ""Thinner"" by Stephen King? I would advise you to complement this film with that short novel. That would give you the picture of those perambulating wild populations that are roaming around in Europe. The tobacconist and newsagent in my village did not believe it till one night she was burglarized. You should have heard her yelling when her insurance company refused to cover most of her loss because she had no alarm on her door and windows.

1119476,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000YENUI6,Jason,"[2, 2]","Not for the squeamish, Eastern Promises paints a bleak picture of the grungy underworld of London, where Russian gangsters are involved in the most heinous acts, and even the most innocent eventually become pawns in the most dangerous game.When a baby is born to a very young woman Tatiana, the childbirth is too much for the mother.  After delivering the baby, midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) finds a diary written in Russian among Tatiana's possessions.  Opening the diary is tantamount to the dangers within Pandora's Box; and in Anna's case, that initial curiosity involves her in the seedy underbelly of a crime family living by the brutal code of Vory V Zakone (Translation: Thieves in law).Among the criminals is Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortenson), a lowly, yet influential driver, whose position has allowed him the constant close proximity to both the gang's patriarch,Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), and his tempermental son Kirill (Vincent Cassell).  Investigating the diary and the baby's lineage further immerses Anna into the gang's world, its crimes, and its secrets, until the movie reaches its gripping conclusion.Regarding the performances in this film, Viggo Mortenson is as powerful as any of his other roles.  He's as stoic as can be, and regardless of the outcome he manages to appear dangerous and sympathetic at the same time.  Speaking in Russian he's convincing and even his accent when delivering lines in English is impressive.  From top to bottom, the slicked hair, the rigid emotion, the facial structure, and the tattoos, he is a gangster.  Speaking of the tattoos, I quite enjoyed the subplot which incorporated the rich meanings and symbolism behind the Russian criminal tattoos.  Without previous knowledge, this is the type of ""tour guide"" information that provides enjoyable depth and intrigue, and otherwise would be easily looked over.  Each of the other characters is fully involved, and they deliver competent performances.  Watts is sympathetic, and the combination of anguish and determination on her face reflects her character's passion for newborns.  Similarly, Stahl is perfect as the crime syndicate leader.  He's one of those calm yet calculating figures who doesn't often get his hands dirty, but when he does he may as well have red skin, horns, and a pitchfork.My hat goes off to Director David Cronenberg for delivering one of the best films I've seen in a while.  It's truly captivating, with each character, line, and setting truly serving a purpose.  With only one underdeveloped angle - Nikolai Luzhin's secret background - there is nearly nothing superfluous.  For a script that already upped the malevolent ante, the bathhouse knife fight is a perfectly heinous coup de grace to drive the point home.  This is a great film, and comes highly recommended.",5,"Two stars for a character, five stars for the movie",1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,2802,"['Not', 'squeamish', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'bleak', 'picture', 'grungy', 'underworld', 'London', 'where', 'Russian', 'gangsters', 'are', 'involved', 'most', 'heinous', 'acts', 'even', 'most', 'innocent', 'eventually', 'become', 'pawns', 'most', 'dangerous', 'game.When', 'baby', 'born', 'very', 'young', 'woman', 'Tatiana', 'childbirth', 'too', 'much', 'mother', 'delivering', 'baby', 'midwife', 'Anna', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'diary', 'written', 'Russian', 'Tatiana', 'possessions', 'Opening', 'diary', 'tantamount', 'dangers', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'Anna', 'case', 'initial', 'curiosity', 'seedy', 'underbelly', 'crime', 'family', 'living', 'brutal', 'code', 'Vory', 'V', 'Zakone', 'Translation', 'Thieves', 'law', 'criminals', 'Nikolai', 'Luzhin', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'lowly', 'yet', 'influential', 'driver', 'position', 'allowed', 'constant', 'close', 'proximity', 'gang', 'patriarch', 'Semyon', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'tempermental', 'son', 'Kirill', 'Vincent', 'Cassell', 'Investigating', 'diary', 'baby', 'lineage', 'further', 'immerses', 'Anna', 'gang', 'world', 'crimes', 'secrets', 'movie', 'gripping', 'conclusion.Regarding', 'performances', 'film', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'as', 'powerful', 'other', 'roles', 'as', 'stoic', 'can', 'be', 'regardless', 'outcome', 'appear', 'dangerous', 'sympathetic', 'same', 'time', 'Speaking', 'Russian', 'convincing', 'even', 'accent', 'when', 'delivering', 'lines', 'English', 'impressive', 'top', 'bottom', 'slicked', 'hair', 'rigid', 'emotion', 'facial', 'structure', 'tattoos', 'gangster', 'Speaking', 'tattoos', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'subplot', 'incorporated', 'rich', 'meanings', 'symbolism', 'Russian', 'criminal', 'tattoos', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'type', 'tour', 'guide', 'information', 'enjoyable', 'depth', 'intrigue', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'easily', 'looked', 'other', 'characters', 'fully', 'involved', 'deliver', 'competent', 'performances', 'Watts', 'sympathetic', 'combination', 'anguish', 'determination', 'face', 'character', 'passion', 'newborns', 'Similarly', 'Stahl', 'perfect', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'leader', 'one', 'calm', 'yet', 'calculating', 'figures', 'who', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'when', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'red', 'skin', 'horns', 'pitchfork.My', 'hat', 'Director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'delivering', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'truly', 'captivating', 'character', 'line', 'setting', 'truly', 'serving', 'purpose', 'only', 'one', 'underdeveloped', 'angle', 'Nikolai', 'Luzhin', 'secret', 'background', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'superfluous', 'script', 'already', 'upped', 'malevolent', 'ante', 'bathhouse', 'knife', 'fight', 'perfectly', 'heinous', 'coup', 'de', 'grace', 'drive', 'point', 'home', 'great', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Viggo plays Nikolai well and the character is interesting. The character is a lost soul, but with a purpose. He does not for a second doubt his path, but he does have small regrets. The violence is intense and comes in small spurts so it is very effective. The movie develops the characters well and the plot is very tight. There is very little wasted effort. Every character has a side to him that you don't expect when the character is first introduced. Every scene unfolds the story. Because of the violence and because the viewer often knows something very bad is going to happen to certain characters, the suspense is kept at a fairly high throughout the movie. The humor is very low key and it comes through Viggo's character. How the russian mob works and it's philosophy was interesting. The story about the tatoos was fascinating as well.

For the most part, that is exactly what it was.  I loved the Godfather, but too many flaws in this film prevented me from enjoying it nearly as much.First, the good points.  Viggo Mortensen was superb in the role of Nikolai.  His accent sounded good, and he fit the part well.  His reserved demeanor and soft-spoken dialog lull a viewer until he erupts into surprising violence. The oft-mentioned sauna scene where he fights naked is both shocking and realistic.  It was graphic violence that I could not look away from, and fully illustrated the dangerous world he was living in.  In fact, there is very little violence but when it does pop up, it is almost always shocking because the rest of the film was so slow.  This is not an in your face gangster movie; at times it was plodding.  The producers did an excellent job of developing and maintaining the mystery of Nikolai.  What are his motivations?  Who is he?  When it was finally revealed, it was a nice twist.  Plus, I loved the parts about the tattoos and their meaning.  It really added something to the film.  Finally, the setting and lighting were fabulous.  The movie was visually, as well as thematically, gritty.  I felt like I was in London, in a Russian neighborhood.However, the movie had many problems.  First, I agree with some reviewers that Naomi Watt's character was too one-dimensional and unbelievably stupid.  What ordinary person upon hearing what's in that diary rushes out to verbally attack a mobster!?  Come on!  Especially in light of her father fleeing Russia and possibly the KGB.  The second problem, and by far the more serious, was the dialog in Russian.  I would hazard a guess that at least 35% of the dialog in in Russia - with no subtitles.  I watched this On Demand with my family, and we wondered if it was supposed to have subtitles after all?  If not, what a bad choice.  A few lines here and there to build authenticity and remind viewers of the subject would have been fine.  But, entire conversations where I had no clue what they were saying and no body language to convey the meaning either?  This was one problem that I could not overcome.  Some of my family found the movie boring, and I think this is a direct cause.  How interesting can it be to watch people talk in a language you don't speak?  And the ending.  I couldn't agree more with all the viewers that hated it.  It was not only unrealistic, it left viewers wondering, ""That's it!? Wait, what happened to...?""  I felt like I was at the end of ""Kill Bill V1"" only no VII is forthcoming.Overall, this movie could have been fantastic despite the slow pace.  Instead, it was disappointing.

1119482,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000YENUI6,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 5]","Film noir was (and is) one of the most celebrated sub-genres in American film. Thus it's strange to see how few noirs have been made since their golden age in the forties and fifties. There was Polanski's masterful ""Chinatown"", the handsomely crafted and atmospheric ""L.A Confidential"", and if you're willing to stretch the idea, Michael Mann's menacing, dreamy ""Collateral"" felt rather nourish. And now we have David Conenberg's ""Eastern Promises""--at its heart merely a well-made crime mystery, taken up a notch by Cronenberg's grisly, brutal direction--a follow-up to his masterful ""A History of Violence"", to add to that list of modern noir.Plot-wise, EP has enough twists and turns to keep viewers interested in its dark, seedy tale. Its central mystery revolves around the diary of a 14-year-old Russian girl, discovered by an English midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) after the girl gives birth and subsequently dies. Since the diary is written in Russian, Anna takes it to a Russian restaurant to get translated (after her bitter Uncle at first refuses). It is here she meets Semyon (Armin-Muehl Stahl), a man who speaks so eloquently you know he's rotten to the core.And he is. In fact, he's the head of an entire crime syndicate; mostly though, we the audience get to know two members of his entourage: son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and their driver Nikolai (Viggo Mortenson). The performers are all great; Naomi Watts brings some personality to a character who seems to be written with none, Vincent Cassel is memorable, and Stahl's presence radiates with calm power.Of course, it's Viggo Mortenson's performance everyone is talking about. His presence as a calm, calculated killer is chilling and tense; he's just as great here as his subtle burn in ""A History of Violence"", his accent unflawed and his rage openly bared. His already infamous fight scene (spectacularly choreographed) is his tour-de-force moment for sure, but it is here where its possible to see what the entire project is: an average thriller made more intense and set apart by Cronenberg's visceral and simply revolting use of violence. Some moments in this film are among the most squeamish you'll ever see, but that's the limit of the film's power.For whereas ""A History of Violence"" was relevant, horrifying, masterful, suspenseful and haunting (staying in your mind long after its end; getting under your very nerves even), ""Eastern Promises"" is merely a passable story served up with the Cronenberg touch. Its ending even felt a little incomplete to me, a few elements unexplained (and not in a good, open-ended way).

Cronenberg has never really made a bad fim and I have a deep appreciation for his darkness, both in the characters of his films and the general lighting and design of his sets.Viggo Mortensen is strong as driver/enforcer for a Russian crime family in London. He has suprisingly little meaningful dialogue and plays the part well by not overcompensating his badness and instead creating a tense aura with his self-confident and unrelenting facial expression. A man with no doubt, only a mission.The plotline follows a young London nurse of Russian heritage and her investigation of the newborn child of a young and addicted prostitute who died shortly after giving birth. Her trail leads her to the Trans-Siberian restaurant, which is owned by Semyon, the head of a Russian crime family, Kirill- Semyons impulsive and violent son and Nikolai (Mortensen) a driver/enforcer who is rapidly gaining the fathers favor.If there is any critcism to be had, it of the unidimensionality of the Kirill role, similar to the ""climbing but dumb son"" role seen in many other organized crime yarns. Great performances are turned in by all other principals and a good bit of the dialogue is in Russian with subtitles- a move that works in giving an honesty to the tale.

1119486,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B000YENUI6,J. Michael,"[2, 2]","This is a terrific movie. Viggo Mortensen gives a fantastic performance as a Russian gangster. The plot is inventive and the look inside the world's most brutal organized crime group is fascinating. However, this movie literally doesn't have an ending. A minor plot point is tied up towards the  end of the movie, but the main conflict of the story is left unresolved. Cronenberg doesn't seem like the kind of director who makes sequels and I've heard nothing about a sequel, so I guess we just have to draw the conclusion that he's just a bad storyteller. Either that or the studio ran out of money or someone misplaced the last portion of the script. Either way, it's a real let down.As a digression, it should be noted that this movie deceptively misinforms us as to the ethnic/religious makeup of the ""Russian"" Mafia. Of course these criminals can in no way be regarded as true Christians, but by the huge crucifix tattooed on Viggo Mortensen's chest and the fact that the Russian mobsters celebrate Christmas, Cronenberg not surprisingly is trying to make us think that the ""Russian"" mafia is  made up of native Russian Orthodox people when in fact the Russian Mafia is almost entirely Jewish. An enlightening expose of the Russian mafia is Robert Friedman'sRed Mafiya: How the Russian Mob Has Invaded America. It would have been interesting for this movie to have shown how law enforcement's war against the Russian Mafia is being hampered by Jewish organizations who fear the anti-semitism that would result from the prosecution of a predominantly Jewish crime group. Friendman reveals:""...law enforcement did little to stem the rising tide of the Russian mob....A large part of the problem was political: the Russian mob was predominantly Jewish. It was for that reason, asserted Campanella and other New York State and federal law enforcement officials, that seven years after Campanella's two-man Russian mob unit in the NYPD was inaugurated, it was shut down in a highly politicized, characteristically New York City type of reaction. The effort had come under considerable criticism from the Jewish establishment, which complained that the adverse publicity generated in the hunt for Russian Jewish criminals would foster anti-Semitism and jeopardize the continued emigration of Russian Jews to Israel and the West.""

Incredible acting (particularly by Viggo Morteensen) as the ""driver"" for a mafia boss's hard drinking son Kirill.Our story begins with Anna, a nurse at the E.R who delivers an infant of a dead 14 year old mother Tatiana. The diary she comes across of this young woman's life in a poor and decaying village in Russia and journey with the hopes and dreams of something better quickly introduces her to the slave trade, forced prostitution and heroin. Inside the diary is a very revealing confession that involves both Kirill and his father directly. Anna seeks someone to translate the diary, but in doing so puts herself in the cross hairs of the mafia. So much so, they are willing to kill for it.Nikoli (Mortensen) is slowly climbing the ladder and ranks within this mafia family, and although he puts on a very hard and rough exterior (while not incapable of extreme acts of violence himself) really shows some compassion for others. After being framed for the actual deed of a botched hit, Nikoli narrowly escapes his own death (one of the most violent scenes) and the truth of the diary is revealed.There are no easy endings in Eastern Promises and without giving up too much of the film what can be promised is an agonizing story of cruelty inflicted on those who are weaker. Namely the mafia exploiting young, naive women and selling them to a world of drugs, abuse, and slavery.Exquisite acting portrayed by all here, but the real transformation of Mortensen is something to see. The story of the Russian Mafia tattoos is quite fascinating and unfortunately much of that was cut from the original screenplay. I wish they would have got more into it on the extra features of the DVD.Eastern Promises is somewhat of a continuation of Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"". How  violence changes people, and is it ever really excused? It gets off to somewhat of a slow start, but it is a fascinating tale with lots of depth and color if one can see it. Well worth seeing, particularly for the performances, Eastern Promises delivers a gritty tale of a harsh, ugly life with some humanity and where not everything is as is seems on the surface.",4,"""There is nothing to tell.

Later on, I saw a preview for the movie, and was surprised to discover that the movie dealt with the Russian mob, featured two very talented people in the lead roles, Viggo Mortensen (`The Lord of the Rings' trilogy) and Naomi Watts (""The Ring"" and ""The Ring 2""), and boasted a critically acclaimed director at the helm with David Cronenberg (""A History of Violence""). After discovering all of this, I must say that my interest was indeed heightened; however, when the movie was released it spent so little time at my local cinema that I never had a chance to go see it. So, I was left waiting for the eventual DVD release, but was the movie worth the wait after all?""Eastern Promises"" is the story of how one action, no matter how benevolent it may be, can be enough to bring your entire world crashing down around you. Anna (Naomi Watts) was living a peaceful existence as a nurse when one night a pregnant teenager is admitted to her hospital, and gives birth, but dies shortly after. With this Anna begins her search to discover if the teen had any surviving relatives that would be willing to care for the newborn child; however, the deeper Anna gets into her search the more frightening the discoveries she makes about this young girl become. During her search Anna comes across the name of a local restaurant owner, but this is far from any ordinary restaurant, as it is merely a front for a Russian mafia family. As she tries to discover the teen's connection to the restaurant, Anna receives a warning from the driver/assassin for the family, Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), to basically stay away if she wants to live. Now, Anna must try to do what's right for the newborn, protect her family, try to keep her world from crumbling around her, all while seeking justice for the wrongs that had been committed against the teenage mother at the hands of the mob.As I stated earlier, I really wanted to see this movie after I found out what it was about. I figured the two lead characters were being handled by two very capable Hollywood talents, and the director had impressed me with his previous effort ""A History of Violence"", so I thought that this movie had a decent chance of being very good. After viewing it, I was somewhat mixed on my opinion of the overall film.The actors were all very good in each of their individual roles within the film. Viggo Mortensen is definitely worthy of any awards he may receive for his role as the driver/up-and-coming assassin for the family. His character Nikolai was incredibly brutal at times, seeming to contain no shred of remorse one minute, then the next he would seem to have a genuine compassion for Anna and her family in his desire to protect her from the evil of his `family'. Naomi Watts was solid as Anna, a nurse who by only trying to do what is right puts all that she knows in jeopardy. The rest of the cast is comprised of various European actors, most of whom I had no recollection of seeing in any other films prior, but each were great in their various roles. Well, I take that back, I had seen Vincent Cassell in a film or two, the most recent was his villainous turn in the thriller ""Derailed"" co-starring Jennifer Aniston and Clive Owen, and I believe he was much better in this film than the latter, due to his character being much more conflicted and not just a complete bad guy. His character was vicious when he had to be, yet also was so weak in front of his father that you almost felt sorry for him at times.The story was good, though moved a little slowly at times. It was very brutal and bloody, shockingly so in some places (primarily the shower fight scene), but then other scenes were perfectly tense with great dialogue to move the story along, and then there would be these seemingly unnecessary scenes that just seemed to drag the movie down. There just didn't seem to be a good balance for the film, perhaps if some of the slow scenes had been trimmed up or removed completely the film would have been better.The direction from David Cronenberg was strong, and he was a suitable fit for the film's gritty, ultra-violent subject matter and the consequences entailed, as he had shown with his previous thriller ""A History of Violence"". Sometimes I wonder if Cronenberg is merely trying to shock the audience or make them somewhat uncomfortable with what he puts on the screen. His last film featured very violent sequences that were incredibly realistic and hard-hitting yet not disturbing, but ""Eastern Promises"" seemed to go even further with the brutality, especially the shower sequence. That scene in particular was necessary to the story, but could have taken place in some other location. The shower location was probably chosen in an attempt to shock the entire audience with the graphic violence and nudity contained all in one scene. I just have to question whether Cronenberg is including these sequences to better the story or to satisfy a thirst for being as unconventional and shocking as he can be with his movies.Overall, ""Eastern Promises"" is an alright movie, it's nothing great but not horrible either. The movie boasts some very impressive performances from each of its actors, and some of the hardest hitting fight scenes I had seen in quite some time, but some very slow periods throughout the film coupled with an overall dreary tone kept this film from being anything worth watching a second time.""Eastern Promises"" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.",3,Every Sin Leaves A

1119497,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B000YENUI6,K. Boullosa,"[4, 5]","I was disappointed in this film, the latest collaboration between David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen (the last was ""A History of Violence"" which I felt was a better film).  Too much is taken for granted in the narrative.  For example: a mobster in black leather who could scare the soundstage crew with his appearance, walking into the maternity ward of a large London hospital, taking a baby out of a crib, putting it into the big black satchel he's carrying, leaving a bouquet of roses in the crib, and walking out with the baby in the bag, without so much as an orderly calling out, ""Hey, just what do you think you're doing?!"" or at least calling a security guard.  Billed as a modern film noir/suspense entry, ""Eastern Promises"" doesn't really offer that much suspsense: it's obvious quite soon that Mortensen's character, Nikolai Luzhin, must be undercover - you'd have to be an idiot not to figure it out quickly. The rest of the suspense centers around whether and when the other characters in the film will figure it out, whether Mortensen and Naomi Watts will end up together, will Watts end up with the baby, and how the hell Mortensen manages to fight off two knife-wielding Russian thugs in leather jackets while stark naked in a steam bath.The film opens with a young girl named Tatiana giving bloody birth to a daughter in the aforementioned large London hospital. Tatiana dies as the baby is born, and midwife Anna finds in her bag a diary written in Russian - that is the only way she knows the dead girl's name.  Anna just HAPPENS to be of Russian descent herself, imagine that! Hoping that the diary will give her some information as to the baby's living relatives, Anna recognizes in the diary the name of a Russian restaurant where Tatiana ""worked"", and takes the diary there.  In doing so, Anna walks right into the arms of the Russian mob, for whom the restaurant is a front. Among other business interests, the Russian mob does a brisk trade in young girls from Eastern Europe (one thing the film never explains is how the pregnant Tatiana escaped from the sex stable in which she was imprisoned).  The Russian mob boss, played by German actor Armen Mueller-Stahl in the kind of familiar, kindly, grandfatherish facade that he seems to have been doing for 15 years, offers to translate the diary.  In reality, as we learn immediately, he is a vicious, amoral Russian Godfather, the autocrat of his crime and his blood family.Mortensen's character, Luzhin, has infiltrated both families as the chauffeur and ""minder"" of the boss's son, Kiril, floridly well-played by French actor Vincent Cassel.  One of Kiril's problems is that he is a closet homosexual, an orientation that he knows his father and the Russian crime world view less than broadmindedly.  He drinks heavily to dull his longing for other men (including Luzhin) and his pain at being a disappointment to his formidable father.The story unfolds from there. Mortensen, as is his wont, turns in a fine performance (it earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination) as the disciplined Luzhin, carefully navigating the treacherous waters of his assignment for MI5's ""Russian Desk"".  Mortensen is gifted with languages and his Russian-inflected English sounds authentic.  Cassel, as mentioned before, is excellent as the swaggering but anguished Kiril, the crime family heir.  Naomi Watts, as the midwife, Anna, is weaker - squeezed between Mortensen's suppressed intensity and Cassel's histronic performance, she comes across as bland.  Even when she confronts Kiril about his grandfather's role in Tatiana's rape and death outside the restaurant, there is a curious lack of emotional force.  Mortensen can offer understatement because it is supported by suggested reserves of intensity - Watts doesn't have those reserves and can't.  And, except for the beginning of the film, we never see her delivering another baby: she only appears in medical garb walking the corridors of the hospital, or hovering over the orphaned baby's crib.  Speaking of which, there is never an explanation of WHY the baby appears to be living permanently in the pediatric ward of the hospital, when we all know that child protective services would have removed the baby within a week at the outside.  This is just one of the many narrative holes that the director asks the viewer to take on faith, perhaps because he felt that with a cast this charismatic and a decent premise, he didn't have to bother plugging those holes.  But the holes rend gaps in the narrative's conceit and interrupt the viewer's immersion in it.  It's just laziness and there is no excuse for it.  Nevertheless, the cast is worth watching at least once, all good to excellent.  Mueller-Stahl, I must say, is believable as the jovial restaurant owner, as the brains of the mob, and as the brutal tormentor of his feckless son.  But he looks about seventy and we are also asked to accept him as the man who initially raped a struggling 14-year-old Tatiana when she was brought in to work in his stable, on the spur of the moment, when Kiril couldn't quite manage it. No offense to Mr. Mueller-Stahl's ""amour propre"", but this was also unconvincing.The film tries hard, but doesn't find a sure enough footing: it's not quite a film noir, or a gangster film, or a romance, or a message movie about the nasty business of sex for sale.  It ventures part way into each of those territories but never quite nails its flag to the mast with enough conviction to raise the film to memorability, which is a shame given the talented cast and possibilities.  There are simply too many aspects that don't jell together, blunting the film's capacity for emotional impact.",3,Less Here Than Meets the Eye,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,5688,"['was',

1119498,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000YENUI6,K. Driscoll,"[25, 32]","It is always an uphill battle to criticize a great filmmaker like David Cronenberg (A History of Violence,Dead Ringers).  Especially when he has two of the brightest actors around in Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts to work with.  But somehow Eastern Promises managed to be a disappointment for me and I'm quite sure my negative opinion of it will not be popular, so I will defend it as effectively as I can.  First though, let me provide a brief overview.Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts) works at a hospital in London.  She oversees the death of a pregnant 14 year old Russian girl.  The child survives and Anna is left with the girl's diary.  It leads her to a restaurant owned by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a Russian crime boss.  Anna wants to track down this girl's family so she can find a safe place for the baby that survived.  Anna's uncle helps to translate the diary and they discover some key secrets regarding Semyon and his son Kirill's (Vincent Cassel) crimes against the baby's dead mother.  Kirill's sidekick is Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen).  Nikolai is enigmatic and cold but his potential has him rising quickly in rank for protecting the often irresponsible Kirill.  Obviously there are some key plot points that are better left unrevealed.The twists in Eastern Promises have been praised but really, place the film in New Jersey and make the gangsters Italian-Americans and sorpresa!, a predictable and formulaic mafia film.  Although, the twists are certainly worth keeping secret and many viewers will probably find them to be enjoyable, they didn't work for me.  I didn't predict them outright but it wasn't difficult to see the intentions that undermined each character and a twist seemed inevitable throughout.  I actually felt a twist or two looming over the film the whole time.  I also thought the major twist in the film's climax to be unconvincing altogether after it happened.  And it wasn't just the twists that seemed like an ethnic proud mafia film all over again.  The different cultural things Russian gangsters hold dear was no doubt an education to some but I was only a little interested and there is a scene at the restaurant were Semyon is enjoying some live music that was just too reminiscent of the tired clich&eacute;s repeatedly borrowed over the years fromThe Godfatherand other such films.As far as the performances go, Viggo is great and so is his accent.  Naomi Watts has never been bad in anything she has done, even when she wasJet Girl.  I thought the remaining supporting cast was absolutely disposable despite what many others have said, and unfortunately I include Vincent Cassel here, who I really like.  On a positive note, Cronenberg's pacing is strong and he once again enlists his favorite cinematographer, the incredibly talented Peter Suschitzky, to help the film look great.Now, about the controversial naked Viggo fight scene.  Cronenberg definitely wanted this scene to stand out and it does, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.  Of course there is a double standard and that is almost forgivable, but if it were Naomi Watts in the naked fight scene the film would unquestionably have gained an NC-17 rating and earned a hardcore exploitation label right down there with the likes ofIlsa the She-Wolf Warden of the SS.  I'm probably guilty of adhering to the double standard too as the film might have received a higher rating for that.

The problem here is the script, which is the biggest load of cliches I have run into since the heyday of Constance Bennett and Gilbert Roland in the early 1930s.  Okay, it was sad when the 14 year old girl loses her life in the poverty ward hospital and gives birth to baby Christine, and as we find out her diary tells an awful story, but it turns ludicrously camp after just a few entries.  I'm sorry, but I got the giggles each time the voice-over started moaning about, ""Today he addicted me to heroin.  How I wish I had not left my home!""And this kept coming back again and again, I suppose to underline the viciousness of Vincent Kassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl, both of them allowed far too much freedom to make the broadest possible acting choices.  Is it possible that neither knew The Godfather had already been made?  Mueller-Stahl in particular is just slimy evil.  He asks Naomi Watts to dinner and politely asks, ""And you have shown Christine's diary to no one?""  What's a girl to do?  I would say, I have sent it to the PO Box of three thousand leading world newspapers and to the BBC.  But instead she just smiles back and says, ""Oh, my uncle who has promised to translate it.""  ""What's his address?"" barks Armin Mueller-Stahl.  But in spite of everything, Naomi Watts just does not get it.Vincent Kassel--again, pure evil but with the Fredo twist of being mentally weak and a slave to his own addictions.Viggo--what can I say?  He is in top physical shape and, contrary to the other reviewer, he's got nothing to be ashamed of downstairs.  But yes, after awhile, even in the famous fight scene, you start giggling because he's taken more abuse than Marlon Brando, and he survives everything--and what's more, learns something.  It's Screenwriting 101, as written by DW Griffith.  Lillian Gish MIGHT have been able to make something of that diary voice-over, but don't bet the farm on it.And at the end of the picture, well, there should have been at least 20 minutes more of the movie, but test audiences must have gotten restless at the 90 minute mark, for the movie ends so abruptly I was still munching on my popcorn and anxiously awaiting a save.

Cronenberg shows that he's matured immensely and presents a truly solid, almost flawless crime flick with many emotional overtones. Mortenson is tremendous, showing little but revealing much.I really enjoyed the script, not one cheesy line in the movie, and the plot moves organically towards a satisfying finale. The over-ballyhooed nude shower scene is notable not for Viggo's hanging wang as for the stark realism of the violence, which is all too realistic. Too much so for my taste, but I've always found Cronenberg overly violent and squirm-inducing; remember Shivers and Videodrome?In any case, this is his finest outing on most every front, and he's really learned to handle actors and get their best work. Watts is also excellent, as is Stahl (a very fine performer indeed in almost all he does). Shore's score is very fine, but you can hear echoes of LOTR and I almost expected orcs to come jumping out of a closet at various points.Not recommended for kids or those who can't stomach occasional very graphic violence, EP is very much recommended for movie lovers who appreciate tight, edgy crime thrillers.",4,Easily Cronenberg's best; Viggo is superb,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1202,"['Beautifully', 'shot', 'tightly', 'scripted', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'brutal', 'touching', 'Cronenberg', 'matured', 'immensely', 'truly', 'solid', 'almost', 'flawless', 'crime', 'flick', 'many', 'emotional', 'overtones', 'Mortenson', 'tremendous', 'showing', 'little', 'revealing', 'much.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'script', 'not', 'one', 'cheesy', 'line', 'movie', 'plot', 'organically', 'towards', 'satisfying', 'finale', 'over-ballyhooed', 'nude', 'shower', 'scene', 'notable', 'not', 'Viggo', 'hanging', 'wang', 'stark', 'realism', 'violence', 'too', 'realistic', 'Too', 'much', 'taste', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'Cronenberg', 'overly', 'violent', 'squirm-inducing', 'remember', 'Shivers', 'Videodrome', 'case', 'finest', 'outing', 'most', 'front', 'really', 'learned', 'handle', 'actors', 'get', 'best', 'work', 'Watts', 'also', 'excellent', 'Stahl', 'very', 'fine', 'performer', 'indeed', 'almost', 'Shore', 'score', 'very', 'fine', 'can', 'hear', 'echoes', 'LOTR', 'almost', 'expected', 'orcs', 'come', 'jumping', 'closet', 'various', 'points.Not', 'recommended', 'kids', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'occasional', 'very', 'graphic', 'violence', 'EP', 'very', 'much', 'recommended', 'movie', 'lovers', 'who', 'appreciate', 'tight', 'edgy', 'crime', 'thrillers']",N/A

1119507,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000YENUI6,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 4]","This 2007 British import is one of the bloodiest and violent films I have ever seen.  It's about the Russian mafia in London and there are scenes in this film that makes The Godfather seem like a nursery story.  Perhaps it's because there is less censorship nowadays but whatever it is, the film feels real, the plot fast and easy to follow and the acting superb.Set in London, Naomi Watts is cast as a nurse in a maternity war who has problems of her own.  She's English born but she lives with her mother and Uncle, both of whom are Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s.  When a teenage girl in her care gives birth and then dies, she has deep feelings for the baby.  She therefore sets out to uncover the mystery of the teenager who has left a diary in the Russian language, which she, herself, cannot read.  She asks her uncle to translate it and when he refuses she goes to an older Russian man who owns an upscale Russian restaurant and who seems to be grandfatherly to everyone around them.While this is going on, the audience sees some vile murders, and one grizzly scene where Viggo Mortenson, cast as a Russian chauffeur, has to dispose of a body.  He works for the older Russian man and his wild and crazy son played by Vincent Cassel.  Violence is everywhere.  Young girls are brought from Russia and forced into brothels.  There is greed, deception and horrific murders.Naomi Watts starts to uncover the truth, and Viggo Mortenson, who was nominated for an Academy Award for this role, starts to befriend her.  There is a stoic cold blooded calmness about him that is quite unnerving.

1119509,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000YENUI6,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[6, 6]","Eastern Promises is one of those multilayered films that you should be REALLY cautious about reading reviews about. You don't want to learn key parts of the plot before you go into the movie, because it is fascinating to watch them unfold. This is a completely spoiler free review for that reason.Eastern Promises is about the Russian Mob scene in London, England. Viggo Mortensen is Nikolai, a Siberian-born low level mob member - a 'driver only' as he constantly makes clear. He is the support of the boss' son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel, recently famous for being the French Thief in the Ocean's 11 series). Kirill is a bit of a wastrel and needs all the help he can get. Into this world comes Naomi Watts as Anna, a midwife at a local hospital. She delivers a baby for a 13 year old Russian girl who then dies on the table. Anna finds the girl's diary and wants to track down the baby's family. Unfortunately for her, the diary is in Russian.Of course it becomes clear pretty quickly that the girl in question was a prostitute to the Russian mob, an unwilling prisoner. Anna's quest to get the diary's information runs up against the mob who would much rather the whole issue go away quietly. Anna can't let it go, and Nikolai gets caught in the middle as the enforcer who needs to follow the rules.Both Nikolai and Anna have to ""hide their emotions"" and only let out glimpses of how they feel. Nikolai as a mobster must always be as close-to-the-vest as possible. Anna, a midwife who has just had a miscarriage herself and had her boyfriend leave her, is also keeping her emotions under wraps. To see the glimpses shine out through their eyes is very powerful.To give away any more would do a great disservice to this fantastic film, so let me talk in generalities. The actors are *superb*. I grew up in a Ukrainian household and Viggo's serious research into his part has really paid off. He actually went to Siberia to hang out with ""tough guys"" and picked up many of the mannerisms and speech patterns of that area. He also did a great deal of research into the tattoo culture of the mob and his research was then used in the movie.Interestingly, Viggo says in the director's commentary that he once went out for lunch with the tattoos still on, and realized that a Russian couple was staring at the marks with fear. It both made him happy that his research was well done and also very guilty that he had inadvertently upset them. He made sure never to wear the tattoos out in public again after that.Much has been made about a multi-minute completely nude fight scene he has in a steam bath. It is amazing in this day and age that women are routinely asked to go completely naked (and the prostitites sometimes are in this film) but if a *guy* is nude it's shocking. Maybe this says something about the level of equality in the world. Interestingly, Viggo said right out that he had no problem doing this scene and I think it really shows just how vulnerable his character was, to have nothing but his own wits to save his life.If other actors had handled these parts I imagine it would have been all in English which really would have cut down on the immersion factor. Instead, because of Viggo's language talents and the talents of the other actors, fair parts of the film are in Russian, which really gives you a great sense for the richness of the language's sound.Highly, highly recommended. This is one of those DVDs that is great to own, because every time you watch it you see one more layer in the way the characters react to dialogue, glance at each other and emit a wealth of emotion in the subtlest of looks.",5,A Must-Own,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,3626,"['Eastern', 'Promises', 'one', 'multilayered', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'REALLY', 'cautious', 'reading', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'learn', 'key', 'parts', 'plot', 'go', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'unfold', 'completely', 'spoiler', 'free', 'review', 'reason.Eastern', 'Promises', 'Russian', 'Mob', 'scene', 'London', 'England', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Nikolai', 'Siberian-born', 'low', 'level', 'mob', 'member', ""'driver"", 'only', 'constantly', 'clear', 'support', 'boss', 'son', 'Kirill', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'recently', 'famous', 'being', 'French', 'Thief', 'Ocean', '11', 'series', 'Kirill', 'bit', 'wastrel', 'help', 'can', 'get', 'Into', 'world', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Anna', 'midwife', 'local', 'hospital', 'baby', '13', 'year', 'old', 'Russian', 'girl', 'who', 'then', 'table', 'Anna', 'girl', 'diary', 'track', 'down', 'baby', 'family', 'Unfortunately', 'diary', 'Russian.Of', 'course', 'clear', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'girl', 'question', 'was', 'prostitute', 'Russian', 'mob', 'unwilling', 'prisoner', 'Anna', 'quest', 'get', 'diary', 'information', 'up', 'mob', 'who', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'whole', 'issue', 'go', 'away', 'quietly', 'Anna', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'Nikolai', 'caught', 'middle', 'enforcer', 'who', 'follow', 'rules.Both', 'Nikolai', 'Anna', 'have', 'hide', 'emotions', 'only', 'let', 'out', 'glimpses', 'how', 'feel', 'Nikolai', 'mobster', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'as', 'close-to-the-vest', 'possible', 'Anna', 'midwife', 'who', 'just', 'had', 'miscarriage', 'herself', 'had', 'boyfriend', 'leave', 'also', 'keeping', 'emotions', 'wraps', 'see', 'glimpses', 'shine', 'out', 'eyes', 'very', 'powerful.To', 'give', 'away', 'more', 'would', 'do', 'great', 'disservice', 'fantastic', 'film', 'so', 'let', 'talk', 'generalities', 'actors', 'are', '*superb*', 'grew', 'up', 'Ukrainian', 'household', 'Viggo', 'serious', 'research', 'part', 'really', 'paid', 'off', 'actually', 'went', 'Siberia', 'hang', 'out', 'tough', 'guys', 'picked', 'up', 'many', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'patterns', 'area', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'deal', 'research', 'tattoo', 'culture', 'mob', 'research', 'was', 'then', 'used', 'movie.Interestingly', 'Viggo', 'director', 'commentary', 'once', 'went', 'out', 'lunch', 'tattoos', 'still', 'realized', 'Russian', 'couple', 'was', 'staring', 'marks', 'fear', 'made', 'happy', 'research', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'very', 'guilty', 'had', 'inadvertently', 'upset', 'made', 'sure', 'never', 'wear', 'tattoos', 'out', 'public', 'again', 'that.Much', 'been', 'made', 'multi-minute', 'completely', 'nude', 'fight', 'scene', 'steam', 'bath', 'amazing', 'day', 'age', 'women', 'are', 'routinely', 'asked', 'go', 'completely', 'naked', 'prostitites', 'sometimes', 'are', 'film', '*guy*', 'nude', 'shocking', 'Maybe', 'something', 'level', 'equality', 'world', 'Interestingly', 'Viggo', 'said', 'right', 'out', 'had', 'problem', 'doing', 'scene', 'think', 'really', 'just', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'was', 'have', 'nothing', 'own', 'wits', 'save', 'life.If', 'other', 'actors', 'had', 'handled', 'parts', 'imagine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'English', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'cut', 'down', 'immersion', 'factor', 'Instead', 'Viggo', 'language', 'talents', 'talents', 'other', 'actors', 'fair', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'Russian', 'really', 'great', 'sense', 'richness', 'language', 'sound.Highly', 'highly', 'recommended', 'one', 'DVDs', 'great', 'own', 'time', 'watch', 'see', 'one', 'more', 'layer', 'way', 'characters', 'react', 'dialogue', 'glance', 'other', 'emit', 'wealth', 'emotion', 'subtlest', 'looks']",N/A

Didn't have that staged and chereographed look to it at all.The ending was too sudden, and unfortunately we felt a bit let down to it. It really needed more of a solid ending here, seeing the destruction and/or decline of the Russian mafia family that Viggo worked for.But when it comes to plot and storyline, as well as top-of-the-line acting, Eastern Promises delivers in spades.

1119518,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000YENUI6,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked this very, VERY dark and quite twisted British crime thriller about Russian mafia. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts), a British-Russian midwife working at a London hospital, finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana, a 14-year-old girl who died in childbirth. She also finds a card from a restaurant, the Trans-Siberian. Anna sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the orphaned baby girl. The owner of the restaurant, a seemingly friendly, even charming, aged man named Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) offers his help and tells his driver, a silent and grim looking man named Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), to &#34;take care&#34; of Anna and her quest... And then the film really begins.This 2007 film was directed by the Great Master of Freaky Twisted Thrillers himself - David Cronenberg. It is also (spiritually rather than narratively) kind of a sequel to his previous collaboration with Viggo Mortenses, the archi-famous &#34;History of Violence&#34;. For all those reasons you can reasonably expect that this film will be very dark, very violent, slightly sick and quite shocking - and those expectations will be FULLY met.This film offers I believe a reasonably faithful insight into the world of Russian mobsters, who mix a great pragmatism about ways they make money with some traditional customs and rituals. Those customs appeared already in the urban underworld in XIX century and were then developped and perfected even more under communism, especially in concentration camps and harshest  prisons.The very peculiar mentality of &#34;vory v zakonye&#34; (mobsters) is very well shown in some of the secret initiation ceremonies, in the importance of various tattoos in establishing the hierarchy amongst criminals, in the necessary respect of some taboos and in some other customs, like the one establishing that one earns more &#34;face&#34; by killing with a knife rather than with a gun (of course, only when such a deed is possible).The general atmosphere of the film is a very excellent thing, as good as in &#34;History of violence&#34;. All actors did very well. This film is really NOT about action scenes, but the very few which are included are great - and absolutely TERRIFYING!The only reason why I give this film four stars instead of five is the very ending, which I believe is a little bit too soft when compared with the rest of the film.That one reservation notwithstanding, this is a good, brutal, original  thriller, with many scenes which impressed and shocked me.

Far from a victim though Mortensen's Nikolai, a low level Chauffeur for the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;'s closeted homosexual son of clan leader, Armin Mueller-Stahl, played by whacked-out Vincent Chassell, Nikolai is all seeing, all doing: he is an enforcer capable of doing the worse kind of jobs in this world without flinching and in several scenes Cronenberg stretches the bounds of good taste but somehow always manages not to snap them.Naomi Watts is also on hand here as a Russian/English mid-wife, Anna and she brings empathy and humanity to this world of depravity, lust and violence. She also sees a kindred spirit in Nikolai though on the surface he is anything but.Mortensen's Nikolai is a superbly complicated character: cynical, intelligent, world-weary and tough enough to stub out a cigarette on his tongue.The centerpiece of ""Eastern Promises"" is Nikolai's attack in a steam bath by Chechen/Armani clad hit men bent on killing him. Nikolai is nude, his assailants are not. The scene goes on for a number of minutes and it is both violent and beautiful with Cronenberg's camera flying above capturing all the grandeur of his mise en scene.The world of ""Eastern Promises"" is much more complicated than that of ""A History of Violence"" wherein small town values were contrasted with big city perversities. In ""Eastern Promises,"" Cronenberg is after bigger fish: the natural order of things is questioned, the underworld is brought squealing and squirming into the light.Cronenberg has a lot on his plate here dealing with not only the disenfranchised natural born English but also those forced into slavery by the Russian mob and brought to England to satisfy the mercurial as well as the sexual needs of a western nation.

Mortensen plays a mob underling, ostensibly working his way up in the deadly hierarchy.  And he plays this role with a cool, controlled brilliance. Watching, we become convinced that his goals are simply that of the other ruthless gangsters: wealth and power.In a very telling scene, that many reviewers seem to have missed, Mortensen's character is forced to participate in the degradation of a young Eastern European woman who, like so many others these days, is forced into a state of sexual slavery by the ""Russian"" mob.  And, yet he remains as gentle as he can be, given the situation.  And he secrets to the poor young lady a symbol of that which separates him from his mob ""comrades"", a sigil of his Christian Ortodoxy.  Later, we come to understand that Mortensen's deadly game is even more hazardous than that of those with whom he works, for he is really working undercover to undermine the mob from within.In our review title, we noted that the movie is gory.

""Eastern Promises"" submerges us in the underworld of the Russian mafia, or ""vory y zacone"". When a teenager known only as ""Tatiana"" dies giving birth in a London hospital, her midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) hopes that translating the young woman's diary will help locate the baby's family. This leads Anna to an imposing Russian restaurateur, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who would be happy to translate the diary. But it soon becomes clear that Tatiana was a victim of the Russian mafia, and her diary incriminates Semyon and his alcoholic, uncontrollable son Kirill (Vincent Cassell). Kirill's inscrutable driver Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) is asked to retrieve the diary but grows fond of Anna.Truth be told, there is nothing exceptional about this script. The storyline is simple and improbable. Most characters are underwritten and fulfill roles more than they represent three-dimensional people. At times I felt like the landscape was populated with cliches. But where ""Eastern Promises"" succeeds, it is unforgettable. Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai walks a fine line, exploiting an odd relationship with incompetent, delusional Kirill, who seems more like his ward than his boss, to advance his own ambitions. Vincent Cassell also deserves praise for Kirill's brutal and pitiful dysfunction. But ""Eastern Promises"" will surely be remembered for its extraordinary fight scene, where a nude, tattooed Nikolai fights for his life in a protracted struggle with two fully-clothed assailants. It is so striking and affecting that it qualifies as one of cinema's great visual triumphs. In English and Russian with subtitles.The DVD (Universal 2007): There are 2 bonus features. ""Secrets and Stories"" (10 min) interviews director David Cronenberg, writer Stephen Knight, and the cast about  the meaning of ""vory y zacone"" or ""thief in law"", the while slave trade depicted in the movie, story, characters, themes, and the language issues. ""Marked for Life"" (7 min) discusses the significance of tattooing, which acts as an identity card or resume in Russian prisons, their symbology, and applying tattoos for the movie.

The diary becomes the object that drives the midwife's journey into the dark world of the London Russian mob, where she connects with a stoic, formidable mob chauffeur played by Mortensen, who is not just a driver, we learn pretty fast. Human sex slavery, murder, loyalties, and betrayals all play their part before we find out the true nature of the various characters by film's end.I had this film sitting around waiting to be watched. I wanted to watch it for 1. Viggo 2. Naomi (both among my fave actors) and 3. due tot he good reviews.However, the reviews that emphasized gore and violence and ""nekkidness"" made me decide to wait for a day when a dark film wouldn't drag my mood down too badly. (Yeah, I can be really affected by films, from joyful to depressing.)I wish I had not waited. The darkness and evil and pain is balanced to a large degree by elements of good and light and courage. It's not a movie that ends happily, but it is a movie that ends realistically and with some hope. Hope that if people take steps to make things right, some things can be made...more right, if not fully right. And that is an ending that doesn't depress me, but makes me feel great respect for people who do step out of comfort zones or take difficult jobs to make the world better. Or just to save one child.It's the ending that I began with when I described to my husband how greatly this movie had appealed to me (and subsequently re-watched it with him). The climactic scene at the waterfront is so beautifully done--the acting has subtleties in body language and vocal tone (especially Viggo's, and I totally understand the Oscar nomination). The visual and editing--just so powerful and humane, even in the darkness and dirt and grit and horror of what has been and what could have been.I cannot stress how amazing Mortensen is. His appearance has been altered by tons of hair spray and gel and clothing and tattos. He moves his body and makes little movements with his head that feel..authentic. He moves as if his secrets cloak him. His accent seems quite, quite good (but not being Russian, I can't say for 100% if it is dead-on).Watts, who is normally such a scene-stealer, is a good match for him, but she doesn't reach his level here. Mortensen has simply absorbed this character too deeply, and he is much more interesting, nuanced, and haunted a character than Watt's. We can't look away when Viggo's Nikolai is onscreen. We are sure he will look ths way or that, tilt his head, smile just so, and give something away to us. Marvelous.The supporting cast (for it's all supportive when Viggo is on) does a great job, including Vincent Cassell's father-dominated, vulnerable-meets-arrogant, repressed gay mobster son. The scene where he blows up party balloons--wow. His face is so full of pain and anxiety and uncertainty and a host of emotions as he speaks to his little girl that we can momentarily forget just how criminal and unfeeling he can be in other circumstances, and in forgetting, sympathize.I also found rivetting the ""made man"" sort of scene, when the criminal leaders come to initiate Viggo--and the tattoos tell their story.As I said, the last few scenes--the waterfront, the double denouement (Viggo's, Naomi's), overlaid with the voice of the dead girl reading the same lines we heard her say in the opening scenes: Wow.And for those who like romantic tension, there is tons here.

Eastern Promises has plenty of those, from a Russian mobster's throat being sawed open by a feeble-minded teenager to Viggo Mortensen's impromptu nudity in a harrowing bath-house scuffle.  Ballsy.  Literally.  What Eastern Promises deals in is humanity and how it is a senseless, jolting dance at times and a ballet at others.  Girls ransported from Russia to London are kept as prostitutes and slaves by the Russian Mob, drugged up, left for dead when they escape.  One of the unfortunate girls turns up pregnant and bleeding in a London drugstore.  She dies during childbirth, leaving behind a beautiful baby girl and a diary of her tormented life.  The novel is written in Russian.  Midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) tries to have her Russian uncle decipher the book, but when he gives her a warning to have the book buried with the dead girl, she go elswhere for trasnlation.  Right to the man responsible for the girl's horrific torment.  Nikolai (Mortensen) is the driver and confidant to the a Russian mafioso's drunken, careless son with clear aspirations of rising within the crime family to a more respectable position.  Anna's appearance shakes his allegiance and his ability to continue doing unspeakble things in the name of honor and tattooed code.This is a great movie with a great twist at the end that you wouldn't have expected at all, unless you follow the subtle clues carefully.  Filled with suspense and brutality as only Cronenberg can show us, this film comes very close to eclipsing such crime dramas as The Godfather or Goodfellas in its blunt clarity.

Re-uniting with his A History of Violence star Viggo Mortensen (in a much deserved Oscar nominated role), Eastern Promises tells the story of a mid-wife named Anna (Naomi Watts) who finds the journal of a Russian teenager who died during childbirth.  Soon enough, Anna learns that the girl had ties to a Russian mob family, headed by an old-school boss (Armin Mueller-Stahl).  Her search for the truth leads her to the boss' volitale son (Vincent Cassel) and his associate Nikolai (Mortensen), who appears to both warn and help Anna at the same time.  Frequently compelling and occasionally blood-curdlingly violent, Eastern Promises is one of those oh so rare films that actually manages to stay with you after the credits roll, and actually surprise you when something unexpected occurs.  Mortensen is spectacular in a finely nuanced performance that is undoubtedly the best of his career.  Even the smaller details, from his body full of tattoos, to his accent, to his sheer physical nature, are superbly detailed and authentic.  As for Cronenberg, he seems to have transcended from being regarded as a master of the horror genre to a master of the thriller, and his brilliantly orchestrated bath house knife fight is brilliant film making.

I thought as the closing credits appeared, ""this is it?"".Of course, everyone is talking about the famous nude fight scene in the bath house.

Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[7, 9]","'Eastern Promises' is essentially a story about a Russian crime family in London, and how their lives intertwine with a British midwife and her family. The film is dark and plodding, and it seems to give a realistic look into the underworld Russian culture of the ""vori v zakone."" These are scary guys.I'm sorry to say I wasn't as thrilled about this film as the previous reviewers seem to be. I won't say it's a bad film, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't walk out of the theater disappointed. The premise is an interesting one; a young Russian mother dies during childbirth, leaving only the baby and a diary behind. The midwife (Watts) takes the diary and decides to track down the girls family so she can give them the baby. The diary, written in Russian, contains some incriminating evidence about some local Russian thugs, who ironically is exactly who Watts takes the diary to for translation. This obviously leads to some interesting drama as the two sides feel each other out and become entangled in a dark and unusual relationship. This is juxtaposed with the story of Nikolai (Mortensen) trying to earn his way into the family by proving his loyalty and obedience. Nikolai is an interesting character who is not exactly who he seems to be, and his revelation toward the end of the film did catch me by surprise.The acting was generally good, most notably Mortensen as Nikolai, the Russian boss (Mueller-Stahl) and Cassel as the brutish yet jovial and child-like Kiril. The cinematography was also good, creating a rich visual backdrop for the film. One of the main weaknesses in my view was the dialogue. While there were a few decent lines, and some good dark humor, there were a few scenes where I was left shaking my head at the inanity of the script. Overall, I just felt generally dissatisfied with the film. I can't really even give a specific reason, but the film just had a sort of vague and incomplete feeling to it, which is not helped by an incredibly anti-climactic ending. I don't know, perhaps it was just too ""nuanced"" for my thick head, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

Although the plot itself is modest and not-too-original, the acting, direction, script, and dark look of the film are all so superb that it is a must see for any serious cinema-goer who isn't too squeamish.The plot centers on Viggo Mortensen, who plays 'the driver' for London Russian mob boss Armin Mueller-Stahl.  Viggo also babysits Stahl's screw-up son, played by Victor Cassell.  All three men deliver such unbelievably credible and subtle performances that Naomi Watts, also a fine acting talent, sometimes seems a little out of her depth.Mortensen rises through the underworld while Watts, a midwife, tracks down an entwined mystery of an abandoned baby.The superb acting is enhanced by a subtle and stellar screenplay and visuals that often contrast light and shadow, devout religious tattoos and brutal tattoo-wearers, family and business, violence and compassion. These contrasts and an 'inside the mob' plot ala Donnie Brasco, are what really make this film a 5-star watch.Downsides are inevitable in a realistic look at a brutal way of life so expect some truly graphic sequences and some predictability.

But art as a response to the terrors of modern life should be yours."" Peter TraversEastern Promises is a tough, bristling film that shows the inside of the Russian Mafia, the Vory V Zakone syndicate. Viggo Mortenson, plays Nikolai, a driver and henchman for Semyon, played by Armin Mueller-Stahl, the owner of a trans-Siberian restaurant in London. Semyon looks like a nice old soul, but underneath he is a monster who will stop at nothing and his son, Kirill, Vincent Cassel, plays his  role masterfully, a man with no conscience.  Naomi Watts plays Anna, a midwife in London. She assists in the delivery of a baby born to a young 14 year old who was raped, and who dies after the birth. Anna tries to find the baby's relatives using her mother's diary. The diary is the secret life of Kirill and Semyon and their home of women used for their pleasure. Anna and Nikolai meet on several occasions, but Nikolai plays his role of the tough, haunted man to the hilt. For Anna and Nikolai, Semyon will unlock secrets neither wants to face.Viggo Mortensen is Nikolai,the menacing haunted driver who kills and maims but displays a softer side that is not easy to overlook. The bath house scene, where he fights for his life, naked, but for his tatoos, is one that will be remembered long after the film is forgotten. ""Covered in tattoos, his body a scroll depicting his personal history of violence, Mortensen conveys a subtle blend of resolve and lost-ness. He's a true, haunting mystery man."" --Robert Horton.David Cronenberg allows the violence to face us head on, there is no warning and we are upfront and then it recedes.

I'm not sure about that, but I certainly discovered a hearty appreciation for Viggo Mortensen.So, today, when I had a break and I saw that Eastern Promises was at a theater near me, I went to see it.  I had not read reviews, (something I recommend) but I figured if Mortensen was in it, it must be worth seeing.I was not disapointed!  As amazing as his performance was in ""Violence"" this totally eclipses it.  His posture, his facial expressions, his voice, as the Russian punk are nothing short of wondrous.  If he doesn't win this year's Oscar I will feel about the same way as when the ballots were counted at the last presidential election.Yes it is violent but it works to highlight the extremes of the character.  Without seeing what he goes through ""in service to"" the Russian mafia, we can't appreciate the heights of his actions.  The simple kiss between Mortensen and Watts...that's all the romance we get here...is enough to light up the whole theater.Yes, the bathhouse scene is amazing!

The violence in it is graphic for a reason - realism.  The subject matter is shocking at times, because you are dealing with very disturbing topics, so be prepared.The story is that of the Russian mob in London, which primarily follows the actions of one family, and specifically the duties of a driver within that mobster family.  The movie does a good job of explaining the Russian mob and how it operates throughout the film.  To accomplish this it uses the sub plot of a maternity nurse who discovers a diary that belonged to a young pregnant Russian immigrant.  The pregnant girl dies while giving birth in the nurse's hospital.  The diary, and uncovering the facts and secrets within are what leads the nurse to encounter the mob firsthand.Throughout the movie, the plot and twists are done exceptionally well and will keep you trying to figure everything out.  If you don't like movies where you need to focus on everything said, or don't like ones you have to think too hard about them, then Eastern Promises might not be your cup of tea.

""Eastern Promises"" features Mortensen in a role of a Russian mafia member posing as a driver on the errands that often include murders.  We also encounter Naomi Watts in a role of a midwife who accidentaly comes across young Russian born teenage mother upon whose childbirth death, our midwife is determined to find newborn child's family in order to avoid having baby sent to the foster child care. The unlikely acquiantance between these two characters and their secret desires (midwife longs for a baby, while our good-hearted thug wants the reigns of Russian underground in London) puts them on a path of violence that is the only way for them to get what they want.

Last year's pairing of him and Viggo Mortensen (A History of Violence) provided one the the most exciting film events of last year. Viggo is so relaxed and subdued that it's hard, at first, to understand his Oscar nomination, though there is a regular undercurrent of renewal and redemption he finds that is so terribly profound (and sad) at the end. This film, based on real persons in the Russian mafia in London, is scripted by the very clever Steve Knight, Oscar nominated for ""Dirty, Pretty Things"", but I thought this was better, though very similar. I won't say more about the plot, but the participation of the always wonderful Naomi Watts, and Armin Mueller-Stahl are perfect. I also liked Vincent Cassel a lot; should've been nominated for his very difficult role. Indeed, the casting all-around is letter-perfect. The DVD offers a few insightful extras, especially about the tattoo element, more important than you might think. I enjoyed ""Eastern Promises"" as an exciting film achievement. A huge feather in the hat of the very competent David Cronenberg. If Viggo's performance seems too subtle to compare against others that weren't nominated, let's not forget his auspicious debut in Sean Penn's ""The Indian Runner"", as well as LOTR and his other pairing with Cronenberg, and many others.

Both an intellectual and an exceptional physical actor, he is an utter pleasure to watch, even when many of the scenes in Eastern Promises are spurting blood in all directions.  The violence coexists with a sense of almost minimalist control and precision--in Mortensen's and Watts's acting and in Cronenberg's direction.  In some ways this is a small film, but it packs a huge punch.  It is circumscribed without being claustrophobic and the use of language--English, Russian, Ukrainian, et al. adds texture without being distracting.  This is superb work.  I loved A History of Violence and I consider Eastern Promises its equal.  The films are similar in concept, though very different in setting and context.

It felt to me like a Russian Goodfellas, or Godfather in essence, of course without the scale and grandiose of those classic mafia films. Maybe it could have been if there were more time devoted to the Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), and not more than half of the movie devoted to the prostitute Tatiana and her daughter. I understand that's what the story was about, and I'm basically complaining about the main plot of the story, but I loved Nikolai's character so much that I wanted to see much more of him. That truly is more of a testiment to Mortensen's performance than it is a criticism of the film. If there were a little more depth to the story (it's only an hour and a half), I wouldn't mind it so much. I just felt like every time I would get sucked into Nikolai's world, the baby subplot pulled me out a little more than I would have liked. I will say though, I really liked how the story came full circle and connected the multiple dots in a very interesting way.This is, like I said, a fantastic film. It has possibly the tensest fight scene that I have ever seen. Major respect goes to Viggo for doing it fully nude. I'm sure thousands of Lord of the Rings chicks lost their marbles after that one. That scene is superb enough for me to recommend this movie to everyone. But as a part of your collection, I am not sure it's for everyone.

As she takes her first breath, midwife Anne (Watts) is calling the time of death of her teenage mother, Tatiana, who bears injection bruises on her slender arms.Perhaps it's the recent loss of her own child from a former lover, the time of year, or just her character in general, but Anne is deeply touched by the situation and vows to find the baby, who she's named Christina, a family and a decent life instead of institutionalized foster care. So she steps over the line and takes the mother's personal effects--a diary which is written in Russian.Despite being warned not to dig any deeper by her Uncle Stepan, a recent Russian emigre and former KGB agent (Skolimowski) and her English mother (Sinead Cusack), she goes to the one place where she has a clue in English--a Russian restaurant called the Trans Siberian.There she meets three men:  Semyon (Mueller-Stahl), an older Russian who appears at first as a strong but benevolent father figure whose Borscht is almost identical to what Anne's own father used to make. Kirill (Cassel) a drunken and somewhat overdramatic heir to the throne and Nikolai (Mortenson) the very dispassionate driver for Kirill, who he's sworn a brotherly allegiance to.At first, Semyon denies knowing anything about the mother of the deceased young woman, but his interest piques when Anne tells him there's a diary.  He offers to translate the diary and find the child's family for her.  Anne at first demurs, suspecting Semyon is Vory v Zakone (Russian mob) but he's very persuasive and she agrees to return the next night.Meanwhile, Kirill, the family enforcer and Semyon's only son, has declared war on a rival Chechin gang by killing one of the members who has disparaged his character. The man is dispatched and disposed of with machinelike precision that's almost more frightening than any violence the film  depicts.Anne's and Kirill's actions set into play a chain of events where we witness violence and betrayal at every turn. Throughout the current action, Tatiana's voice (Sarah Labrosse) quietly relates the contents her diary to us, detailing first hope, then rape and prostitution while being forced to take drugs every day.Director David Cronenberg definitely upped the ante as far as violence and that violence is depicted with a clarity and realism that few films today can match.While many focus on the violence, what's most interesting about this film is the character study. Mueller-Stahl's depiction of Semyon is the best 'Godfather' I have seen to date and is in my opinion well worth a supporting actor  Oscar. His switch from a loving family man to someone who'd betray a member for another will keep you riveted in your seat.Both Anne and Nikolai cross the line in different ways and seeing how the two individually act and interact with each other is one of the best parts of the film.  Anne doesn't hold back what she feels while Nikolai plays his cards very close to the vest, but can surprise you too.Viggo Mortenson, who I will always reign as Aragorn in my mind, was also amazing.  According to the press on ""Promises"", he spent weeks in Russia traveling without a translator so he could perfect his Russian and his knowledge of the culture that made Nikolai. The man will always have 'stars' as far as I am concerned.",5,Strong film--character study features contrast between compassion and dispassion,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,3343,"['Just', 'five', 'days', 'short', 'Christmas', 'girl', 'child', 'born', 'first', 'breath', 'midwife', 'Anne', 'Watts', 'calling', 'time', 'death', 'teenage', 'mother', 'Tatiana', 'who', 'injection', 'bruises', 'slender', 'recent', 'loss', 'own', 'child', 'former', 'lover', 'time', 'year', 'just', 'character', 'general', 'Anne', 'deeply', 'touched', 'situation', 'vows', 'find', 'baby', 'who', 'named', 'Christina', 'family', 'decent', 'life', 'instead', 'institutionalized', 'foster', 'care', 'line', 'mother', 'personal', 'effects', 'diary', 'written', 'Russian.Despite', 'being', 'warned', 'not', 'dig', 'deeper', 'Uncle', 'Stepan', 'recent', 'Russian', 'emigre', 'former', 'KGB', 'agent', 'Skolimowski', 'English', 'mother', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'one', 'place', 'where', 'clue', 'English', 'Russian', 'restaurant', 'called', 'Trans', 'Siberian.There', 'three', 'men', 'Semyon', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'older', 'Russian', 'who', 'first', 'strong', 'benevolent', 'father', 'figure', 'Borscht', 'almost', 'identical', 'what', 'Anne', 'own', 'father', 'used', 'make', 'Kirill', 'Cassel', 'drunken', 'somewhat', 'overdramatic', 'heir', 'throne', 'Nikolai', 'Mortenson', 'very', 'dispassionate', 'driver', 'Kirill', 'who', 'sworn', 'brotherly', 'allegiance', 'to.At', 'first', 'Semyon', 'knowing', 'anything', 'mother', 'deceased', 'young', 'woman', 'interest', 'piques', 'when', 'Anne', 'diary', 'translate', 'diary', 'find', 'child', 'family', 'Anne', 'first', 'demurs', 'suspecting', 'Semyon', 'Vory', 'v', 'Zakone', 'Russian', 'mob', 'very', 'persuasive', 'return', 'next', 'night.Meanwhile', 'Kirill', 'family', 'enforcer', 'Semyon', 'only', 'son', 'declared', 'war', 'rival', 'Chechin', 'gang', 'killing', 'one', 'members', 'who', 'disparaged', 'character', 'man', 'dispatched', 'disposed', 'machinelike', 'precision', 'almost', 'more', 'frightening', 'violence', 'film', 'depicts.Anne', 'Kirill', 'actions', 'set', 'play', 'chain', 'events', 'where', 'witness', 'violence', 'betrayal', 'turn', 'current', 'action', 'Tatiana', 'voice', 'Sarah', 'Labrosse', 'quietly', 'contents', 'diary', 'detailing', 'first', 'hope', 'then', 'rape', 'prostitution', 'being', 'forced', 'take', 'drugs', 'day.Director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'definitely', 'upped', 'ante', 'as', 'far', 'violence', 'violence', 'depicted', 'clarity', 'realism', 'few', 'films', 'today', 'can', 'match.While', 'many', 'focus', 'violence', 'what', 'most', 'interesting', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'depiction', 'Semyon', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'opinion', 'well', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'switch', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'someone', 'who', ""'d"", 'betray', 'member', 'will', 'keep', 'riveted', 'seat.Both', 'Anne', 'Nikolai', 'cross', 'line', 'different', 'ways', 'seeing', 'how', 'two', 'individually', 'act', 'interact', 'other', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'Anne', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'what', 'Nikolai', 'cards', 'very', 'close', 'vest', 'can', 'surprise', 'too.Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'who', 'will', 'always', 'reign', 'Aragorn', 'mind', 'was', 'also', 'amazing', 'According', 'press', 'Promises', 'spent', 'weeks', 'Russia', 'traveling', 'translator', 'could', 'perfect', 'Russian', 'knowledge', 'culture', 'made', 'Nikolai', 'man', 'will', 'always', 'have', ""'stars"", 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned']",N/A
1119557,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000YENUI6,RMurray847,"[126, 137]","I emphasized the ""ADULT-THEMED"" idea in my title because one of the best things about seeing a film like EASTERN PROMISES is that it is so adult, so uncompromised. Cronenberg gets to make the movies he wants to, and it doesn't have to be watered down or dumbed-down to make it sell to a broad audience. We get a brutal, sometimes squirm-inducing look at a underworld we haven't seen like this before...and there's no gloss, no pandering to a teen audience, no sappy ending, etc. etc. The ending is SATISFYING...but it isn't easy or ""Hollywood.""First of all, the script is outstanding. From the creator of another stunning film about London's ""seamy underbelly,"" DIRTY PRETTY THINGS...the plot makes sense, the threads all come together and the characters are simply but sharply delineated. Yet at no time do I feel the themes are being spoon-fed. Also, some of the acts that are perpetrated on Viggo Mortensen's character near the end of the film are acts of amazing betrayal...yet if you haven't been paying attention, you might miss that. It's not a super-complex plot...but it doesn't grab you by the hand and lead you from place to place.Speaking of Mortensen...this is his best performance ever. Granted, Aragon is crown-jewel, and he handled it well...but those films were events, such spectacle that often what he simply needed to do was wear his costume, ride his horse and look great. In EASTERN PROMISES, he has to make us care about a very nasty piece of work indeed. He's also very stony-faced...so much of what we learn about him, especially early on, comes from very subtle work. Again, each word of the script is perfectly chosen, and Mortensen digs deep here. He's not always my favorite actor...I actually wasn't nuts about him in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (A film I otherwise greatly admired)...but he's perfectly cast here. And of course, he's amazing to watch in the now infamous nude fight scene. It's a little bit distracting being aware of male full-frontal nudity flashing around...almost enough to take one out of the scene...but the scene is so well staged that the sheer PAIN of it soon wipes out any feeling of ""hey, we get to see ALL of Viggo Mortensen.""Armin Mueller-Stahl plays the older patriarch of the Russian mafia family, and he's the best of this type of character I've seen in awhile. You know the one...the old gangster who is so sweet and loving to the youngsters in his family, so polite and full of grace and manners. Picture Brando in the wedding scenes of THE GODFATHER or even Paul Newman in early scenes of ROAD TO PERDITION. Stahl is even better...his eyes twinkle with charm. But boy, when the mask drops and we see the real guy...still soft-spoken and considered...he's stunningly evil. I really enjoyed seeing him again...it seems like it's been awhile since he was in a film.Vincent Cassel plays Stahl's hot-headed son...another gangster cliche...the kid who is supposed to take over the business, but is actually a bit of a moron and troublemaker. But again, the character has surprises up its sleeve. Also, Naomi Watts plays the nurse who brings a motherless baby unwittingly into this underworld...and she is reliably good. Her character doesn't get to have all the dramatic flourishes...but Watts gives another patented, fully committed, honest performance. I believe she may be our most under-rated actress, even though she has been nominated for awards and starred in many films...I think she's still undervalued. EASTERN PROMISES won't win her new fans or an Oscar...but she is still very good.Notice I didn't talk much about the plot. Others have done it better, and to be honest, I'd love it if you just went to see the film having little idea of what you were about to experience. It's a brutal journey...but it is full of unexpected turns...not just of plot but of character. I'll bet come year end, this will still be one of my favorites of the year!

1119558,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000YENUI6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Eastern Promises (David Cronenberg, 2007)Film critic Jim Emerson has said that the central fight scene in Eastern Promises is ""sure to go down as a raw, brutal, and pulse-pounding landmark in the history of fight scenes....If a fight scene doesn't make you feel like you're a part of it, so that it quickens your heartbeat and your breathing, then it's a failure."" (Scanners, Sept. 10, 2007) And yes, Eastern Promises joins that very small list of modern movies-- They Live, Girlfight, Fight Club-- that will give you a bloody nose just watching them. (Oddly, I haven't seen anyone comparing the fight scene in Eastern Promises to its obvious cognate in A History of Violence, the infamous scene on the stairs.) Looking at the fight, by itself, is a good way to drive into the core of David Cronenberg's genius, the uncanny ability to unnerve us with the body that he's displayed in the thirty-two years between his first big-screen production, Shivers, and now. Cronenberg is an auteur of bodily horror; even if he seems to have retired from the explicitly-gross genre after the beautiful, underrated eXistenZ and gone into the more mainstream thriller, these scenes have the same effect, albeit more muted, than the shocking birth scene of The Brood or the head explosion in Scanners: scenes that are no less shocking thirty years later, despite so many pale imitations, and despite our tolerance as a culture for movie violence being so much higher than it was in the late seventies.Eastern Promises is, at its heart, a love story, just as A History of Violence was before it (and, for that matter, as The Brood was before that). It starts when Russian gangster Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen, whose penchant for accents never fails to amaze me) meets Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife who discovers the diary of a woman who died in childbirth and wants to return it to the woman's family. The contents of the diary, when translated, tie the leader of the gang Mortensen's working to the child. After finding out Anna's Russian uncle read the diary, the gang leader (Armin Mueller-Stahl) orders the uncle killed, and the thriller part of the film begins. But-- and this is odd for a Cronenberg film-- the thriller plot almost takes a backseat to the relationship between Nikolai and Anna, who are so obviously meant for one another and, of course, can't be together.Ah, but then there's the fight scene, which is at best tangential, but during which Cronenberg's body horror resuscitates itself and comes roiling to the fore. The actors themselves did the entire scene, no stuntmen, and if the sound effects were later overdubbed, they were overdubbed with the actual sounds of fists on flesh, which are so notably absent (replaced by more dramatic sound effects) from so many other films. It's the fight scene that shows us Cronenberg's attention to detail and passion for realism in his films, even when those films are far beyond the bounds of the real. It's these things that made me see films such as Scanners and Videodrome as successes, back when I first saw them (and, still, today; Scanners sits high on my list of the best movies ever made). And when you take such a philosophy and put it into a film that actually realistic, how can you not come up with a winner?The movie does everything Hollywood doesn't. It's tense without consciously creating tension, dramatic without consciously creating drama. It's a love story that has no love whatsoever in it, just two people who are civil to one another when they should by rights be clawing each other's eyes out. How it can work, and work so very well, is something Hollywood has forgotten, and it's why I find myself liking so many foreign films better than their Hollywood cognates. (Eastern Promises, done by a Canadian director and filmed entirely on location in London, written by a British guy, is foreign enough to count as foreign, for the purposes of this discussion.) Those of you who previously dismissed Cronenberg as a horror director, it's time to go back and re-evaluate his new career as a director of crime thrillers; perhaps, once you see what he's on about here, you'll find yourself with a great deal more appreciation for what he did in his older movies. ****",4,"Cronenberg as Thriller Director, Part II",1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,4232,"['Eastern', 'Promises', 'David', 'Cronenberg', '2007', 'Film', 'critic', 'Jim', 'Emerson', 'said', 'central', 'fight', 'scene', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'sure', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'raw', 'brutal', 'pulse-pounding', 'landmark', 'history', 'fight', 'scenes', 'fight', 'scene', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'part', 'heartbeat', 'breathing', 'then', 'failure', 'Scanners', 'Sept.', '10', '2007', 'yes', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'very', 'small', 'list', 'modern', 'movies', 'Live', 'Girlfight', 'Fight', 'Club', 'will', 'give', 'bloody', 'nose', 'just', 'watching', 'Oddly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anyone', 'comparing', 'fight', 'scene', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'obvious', 'cognate', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'infamous', 'scene', 'stairs', 'Looking', 'fight', 'good', 'way', 'drive', 'core', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'genius', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'unnerve', 'body', 'displayed', 'thirty-two', 'years', 'first', 'big-screen', 'production', 'Shivers', 'now', 'Cronenberg', 'auteur', 'bodily', 'horror', 'even', 'have', 'retired', 'explicitly-gross', 'genre', 'beautiful', 'underrated', 'eXistenZ', 'gone', 'more', 'mainstream', 'thriller', 'scenes', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'more', 'muted', 'shocking', 'birth', 'scene', 'Brood', 'head', 'explosion', 'Scanners', 'scenes', 'are', 'less', 'shocking', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'so', 'many', 'pale', 'imitations', 'tolerance', 'culture', 'movie', 'violence', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'higher', 'was', 'late', 'seventies.Eastern', 'Promises', 'heart', 'love', 'story', 'just', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'was', 'matter', 'Brood', 'was', 'when', 'Russian', 'gangster', 'Nikolai', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'penchant', 'accents', 'never', 'amaze', 'Anna', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'midwife', 'who', 'diary', 'woman', 'who', 'died', 'childbirth', 'return', 'woman', 'family', 'contents', 'diary', 'when', 'translated', 'tie', 'leader', 'gang', 'Mortensen', 'working', 'child', 'finding', 'out', 'Anna', 'Russian', 'uncle', 'read', 'diary', 'gang', 'leader', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'orders', 'uncle', 'killed', 'thriller', 'part', 'film', 'odd', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'thriller', 'plot', 'almost', 'backseat', 'relationship', 'Nikolai', 'Anna', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'obviously', 'meant', 'one', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'together.Ah', 'then', 'fight', 'scene', 'best', 'tangential', 'Cronenberg', 'body', 'horror', 'roiling', 'fore', 'actors', 'did', 'entire', 'scene', 'stuntmen', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'later', 'overdubbed', 'were', 'overdubbed', 'actual', 'sounds', 'fists', 'flesh', 'are', 'so', 'notably', 'absent', 'replaced', 'more', 'dramatic', 'sound', 'effects', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'fight', 'scene', 'Cronenberg', 'attention', 'detail', 'passion', 'realism', 'films', 'even', 'when', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'bounds', 'real', 'things', 'made', 'see', 'films', 'such', 'Scanners', 'Videodrome', 'successes', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'still', 'today', 'Scanners', 'high', 'list', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'when', 'take', 'philosophy', 'put', 'film', 'actually', 'realistic', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'winner', 'movie', 'everything', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'tense', 'consciously', 'creating', 'tension', 'dramatic', 'consciously', 'creating', 'drama', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'whatsoever', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'civil', 'one', 'when', 'should', 'rights', 'be', 'clawing', 'other', 'eyes', 'out', 'How', 'can', 'work', 'work', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'forgotten', 'why', 'find', 'liking', 'so', 'many', 'foreign', 'films', 'better', 'Hollywood', 'cognates', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'done', 'Canadian', 'director', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'location', 'London', 'written', 'British', 'guy', 'foreign', 'enough', 'count', 'foreign', 'purposes', 'discussion', 'who', 'previously', 'dismissed', 'Cronenberg', 'horror', 'director', 'time', 'go', 'back', 're-evaluate', 'new', 'career', 'director', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'perhaps', 'once', 'see', 'what', 'here', ""'ll"", 'find', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'appreciation', 'what', 'did', 'older', 'movies', '****']",N/A

It felt somehow thin, like he did not understand the culture in the way that he does that of Northern America.  As is his hallmark, it also has extremely graphic violence, to the point that it was sickening for me in ways that his previous films have not been, but that is subjective, I suppose.  I couldn't quite believe it, though it is a near miss.The story is about Eastern EUropean criminals, who are operating in London.  Unable to return home, they are carving a new niche for themselves in prostitution, drugs, and contract killing.  Cronenberg struggles to recreate their unique culture and some of it works, such as the tattoo tradition, whereby their lives are displayed for anyone to see (if they are naked).  Enter an innocent, Watts, who is a midwife taking care of the baby whose birth killed her mother, a sex slave from the Ukraine.  Watts decides to investigate, starting with a notebook she wants to translate.  Naively, she goes to a restauranteur seeking answers, a charming and mild mannered man who is not what he appears.  His son (Cassell) and helper (Mortensen) are the principal characters who carry out his dirty work; their chemistry is the most believable aspect of the entire film and expertly acted.  Mortensen's character is mysterious:  he is a brute who can kill, but also has a sympathetic side, at least for Watts.  What the film lacks in finesse, it tries to make up in violence and nudity, almost entirely of Mortensen.

1119561,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000YENUI6,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","For most of his career, cinema maverick David Cronenberg has been content to make films on the far-off, outer margins of the commercial mainstream.  It's only natural then that he would one day feel the need to come in from the cold (at least for awhile) and get a taste of what life is like for those on the inside.  He began that effort a few years back with ""A History of Violence,"" a fairly straightforward movie that earned him a measure of success at the box office and a great deal of respect from both the critical establishment and his fellow directors.  Now, he continues the mainstreaming process with ""Eastern Promises,"" a riveting but largely conventional crime drama that serves as a showcase for a half-a-dozen or so brilliant performances.  And if the movie feels as if it is lacking in the kind of originality, passion and uniqueness of vision we`ve come to expect from Cronenberg, well, there are certainly enough compensatory virtues to make the film very much worth seeing.Set in London, the movie takes us into the dark, frightening underworld of the Russian mafia.  Viggo Mortensen plays Nikolai Luzhin, a recent Russian immigrant working as a chauffeur for a mob boss who uses the respectability of a high-end restaurant as a cover for his nefarious deeds.  Naomi Watts co-stars as Anna, a local midwife who stumbles upon the diary of a 14-year old girl who has just died in childbirth, a diary that could implicate the old man on charges of rape, drug-dealing and child endangerment.  This knowledge puts Anna's life and the lives of her family at risk, so the question becomes will Nikolai side with his boss or with this innocent woman who is, ever so slowly, finding her way into his heart.In ""Eastern Promises,"" Cronenberg abandons the over-the-top, absurdist elements that used to define the director's work, and settles for a more straightforward approach instead.  That is not meant to in any way denigrate the movie, for it is an intriguing tale that isn't afraid to take its time unraveling its story.  Cronenberg maintains a surprisingly low-keyed tone throughout, confident that tension can sometimes be achieved more effectively through understatement than through hyperbole.  Steve Knight's dialogue is flavorful and pungent, and he is blessed with a first-rate cast who clearly knows how to deliver the lines he`s written.  Mortensen, sporting a thick Russian accent, creates a menacing presence through his sturdy demeanor and stoic expression.  Yet, he allows glimmers of tenderness to occasionally seep out from the edges of his half-smile or the center of his piercing eyes.  Armin Mueller-Stahl provides a similarly discomfiting mixture of grandfatherly gentleness and steely-eyed ruthlessness as the Old World mob boss who is anything but the benign, kindly restaurateur he portrays himself as being.  Vincent Cassell as his overcompensating son, Naomi Watts as the compassionate Anna, and Sinead Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski as Anna's concerned mother and uncle all deliver compelling, memorable performances.Thus, even though I prefer Cronenberg when he's stirring up trouble way out there on the fringe in cutting-edge movies such as ""Crash"" or ""Spider,"" there are still many good reasons for checking out ""Eastern Promises.""",4,A Promise Largely Fulfilled,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,3272,"['most', 'career', 'cinema', 'maverick', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'been', 'content', 'make', 'films', 'far-off', 'outer', 'margins', 'commercial', 'mainstream', 'only', 'natural', 'then', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'feel', 'need', 'come', 'cold', 'least', 'awhile', 'get', 'taste', 'what', 'life', 'inside', 'began', 'effort', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'movie', 'earned', 'measure', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'great', 'deal', 'respect', 'critical', 'establishment', 'fellow', 'directors', 'Now', 'mainstreaming', 'process', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'riveting', 'largely', 'conventional', 'crime', 'drama', 'showcase', 'half-a-dozen', 'so', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'movie', 'feels', 'lacking', 'kind', 'originality', 'passion', 'uniqueness', 'vision', 've', 'come', 'expect', 'Cronenberg', 'well', 'are', 'certainly', 'enough', 'compensatory', 'virtues', 'make', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'seeing.Set', 'London', 'movie', 'dark', 'frightening', 'underworld', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Nikolai', 'Luzhin', 'recent', 'Russian', 'immigrant', 'working', 'chauffeur', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'respectability', 'high-end', 'restaurant', 'cover', 'nefarious', 'deeds', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'co-stars', 'Anna', 'local', 'midwife', 'who', 'diary', '14-year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'died', 'childbirth', 'diary', 'could', 'implicate', 'old', 'man', 'charges', 'rape', 'drug-dealing', 'child', 'endangerment', 'knowledge', 'Anna', 'life', 'lives', 'family', 'risk', 'question', 'will', 'Nikolai', 'side', 'boss', 'innocent', 'woman', 'who', 'ever', 'so', 'slowly', 'finding', 'way', 'heart.In', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'Cronenberg', 'over-the-top', 'absurdist', 'elements', 'used', 'define', 'director', 'work', 'settles', 'more', 'straightforward', 'approach', 'instead', 'not', 'meant', 'way', 'denigrate', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'tale', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'take', 'time', 'unraveling', 'story', 'Cronenberg', 'surprisingly', 'low-keyed', 'tone', 'confident', 'tension', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'achieved', 'more', 'effectively', 'understatement', 'hyperbole', 'Steve', 'Knight', 'dialogue', 'flavorful', 'pungent', 'blessed', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'who', 'clearly', 'how', 'deliver', 'lines', 's', 'written', 'Mortensen', 'sporting', 'thick', 'Russian', 'accent', 'menacing', 'presence', 'sturdy', 'demeanor', 'stoic', 'expression', 'glimmers', 'tenderness', 'occasionally', 'seep', 'out', 'edges', 'half-smile', 'center', 'piercing', 'eyes', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'similarly', 'discomfiting', 'mixture', 'grandfatherly', 'gentleness', 'steely-eyed', 'ruthlessness', 'Old', 'World', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'anything', 'benign', 'kindly', 'being', 'Vincent', 'Cassell', 'overcompensating', 'son', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'compassionate', 'Anna', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'Jerzy', 'Skolimowski', 'Anna', 'concerned', 'mother', 'uncle', 'deliver', 'compelling', 'memorable', 'performances.Thus', 'even', 'prefer', 'Cronenberg', 'when', 'stirring', 'up', 'trouble', 'way', 'there', 'fringe', 'cutting-edge', 'movies', 'such', 'Crash', 'Spider', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'good', 'reasons', 'checking', 'out', 'Eastern', 'Promises']",N/A

Once you're dealing with that kind of wealth, very few people ask serious questions about where the money comes from.  To say that there are some seriously wealthy Russians with murky pasts currently residing along the Thames is like saying there are a few computer geeks in Silicon Valley.And so it is that David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen reunite after 2005's ""A History of Violence"" for another sterling film focusing on the darker side of human nature.  The movie opens with an assassination (throat slit in a barber's chair) and a death of an innocent girl (giving birth to a her daughter).  The girl is a Russian, Tatiana, and the London midwife, Anna (Naomi Watts), who helped deliver her daughter takes it upon herself to find the orphan's family.Her only clue is Tatiana's diary, and it leads her to a Russian restaurant, owned by the suave, unsettling Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stall).  Semyon shows a disturbing interest in the diary and offers to help Anna translate it.  And so Anna finds herself slowly brought into Semyon's criminal world, for the restaurant is a mere front for Semyon's other, more lucrative businesses.Semyon has his own issues.  His son, Kirill (Vincent Cassell) is a drunken wastrel, and does not compare favorably to the hired help, Nikolai (Mortensen).  Nikolai is allegedly the chauffeur for Kirill, but he's clearly the guy who gets things done and cleans up after Kirill's mistakes, as Nikolai proves when he calmly disposes of the evidence of a murder.This is a movie of atmosphere and tension, where tattoos can say more than the longest speeches.  Mortensen practically disappears into Nikolai, but that shouldn't be a surprise for anyone who has watched him act before.  Nikolai has some charm and some compassion, but it is wrapped up in so many layers of ruthlessness and fatalism that it only occasionally gets a chance to rear its ugly head.  Mortensen is so perfect for this part that it's hard to appreciate how perfectly he was cast in ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hidalgo.""Cronenberg deftly weaves a complex web of deceit, betrayal, and devotion - this is not a movie you should watch with one of those friends who prefers to yak yak yak and expect you to ""tell me what's happening.""  The entire plot can turn on a quick aside or terse conversation, but the movie rewards the diligent viewer.This is also an extremely violent movie, culminating in one of the best fight scenes in any movie when Nikolai fights off two Chechen mobsters out for revenge, armed and clad with nothing other than his tattoos.Mortensen deserves an Academy Award, and it's possible that if he wins one in the next couple of years, the award will be payback for passing him over for this performance.

I like Watts and Mortensens chemistry, Viggo does dark and mysterious better than anyone in film, and Watts, though her character is unbelieveably naive, does her best with a sort of thankless role, this movie is really about Mortensen and his relationship to mob scion Kirill and to Russian mob boss, Mueller-Stahl, who is fantastic as usual, he's chilling as this family head, who dispises his son, Kirill, but yet cannot help but indulge him, he is his spawn afterall.

While the overall ambiance is violent, several gruesome scenes leave little or nothing to the imagination.  Given the role of organized crime that is to be expected, though in a few scenes graphic gore was gratuitous.  In those instances the plot could have been as strong or stronger left to wilder imaginings.  From the vantage point of the Russian mob (Vory), this film presents a shadier side of London, which is very artfully done without using any of its typically associated shtick.  There is no polite reserve or refinement in the lives of these characters.  What is presented is a very bare, bleak existence that without geographical reference could easily have been a grey eastern land.  No one character stood out, thus no performance stood out.  Rather, the fluid chemistry amongst the cast created this believable world, part of it intent on resolving a mystery as furiously as the rest of it focused on hiding clues.The one thing that I felt this film suffered was the absence of history connecting Nikolai to the Vory.  The omission doesn't detract from the plot resolution or from Nikolai's development as a character, though a mere two lines would suffice to tie him more thoroughly into the family and generate more sympathy for his plight.  As it stood his involvement was vague and confusing, which definitely took away from the rest of the well-crafted story.

GORKY PARK was my first venture into this subject, and, as with most movies about mob life, it repels and fascinates.I admired A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, with it's message that violence begets violence---among the other several messages that come through---and saw that perhaps this film might be a further development of the theme in another context.EASTERN PROMISES delivers on several levels.  Of course it contains violence, but most is implied, and the the touted bath house scene that I dreaded---since I am anything but a fan of violent films---was actually restrained.  The scene was utterly effective, not of long duration, and furthers the plot.  The acting is restrained and nuanced: the silence of Viggo Mortensen's character speaks volumes but gives little away as does that of Armin Mueller-Stahl, Naomi Watts, and Vincent Cassels.  It is photographed beautifully, capturing London the way I remember it---chilly, damp, and vibrant.Cronenberg makes us think about his films whether we are inclined to do so or not.

The story revolves around a Russian mob family living in London, and the inner workings and betrayals of that family.  Mortensen makes this movie, playing such a bastard that you can't help but hate him through most of the film.  The coldness with which he portrays a Russian mobster is chilling, and his exterior and character portrayal are flawless.  There is an excellent supporting cast as well, including Naomi Watts as the midwife caught up in the underworld she knows nothing about.  I won't give away the ending, but there is a huge twist I had no idea was coming, that makes me appreicate this director's genius.

Taut, captivating, and unflenchingly brutal in spots, this film is definitely one of the years best.Viggo Mortensen (terrific here as he was in Cronenberg's other classic, A History of Violence) stars as a chauffeur to the son of the Russian Mafia Godfather in England. The son (played by Vincent Cassel) is an alcoholic incompetent who is a disgrace to his father (played by Armin Mueller-Stahl). Mortensen finds himself trying to be obedient to his boss while constantly having to help him get out of trouble.But Mortensen is stretched to the limit when a young woman dies in childbirth at a local hospital. The midwife attending her (played by Naomi Watts)goes through the woman's belongings and finds a diary she'd written in Russian. A card in the diary leads to the Russian Godfather's business. And things quickly become very complicated.Cronenberg, who became famous for making gross-out horror films like Scanners and The Fly, has become one of the great thriller directors of our era. And he has found a more than capable accomplice in Mortensen, who pulls off this role effortlessly.

I love David Cronenberg and this is one of his more accessible works, though the violence (surprisingly there's not too much of it save for the brawl, considering it's a Cronenberg film and all) may put off some of those who can't get past just the idea of violence.

My main beef with this disc is the lack of a Cronenberg commentary as he's one of the few directors that never fail to give great insight and anecdotes to his work.This DVD is pretty much the film presented in a slightly better than average transfer and a decent sound mix with few extras. I smell a special edition release somewhere down the line but I'd give this DVD a pass, especially if you enjoyed the film.",4,The year's most talked about scene...,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,1230,"['rightfully', 'so', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'naked', 'bathhouse', 'brawl', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Other', 'rest', 'film', 'sheer', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'great', 'acting', 'turns', 'everyone', 'involved', 'especially', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'head', 'love', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'one', 'more', 'accessible', 'works', 'violence', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'save', 'brawl', 'considering', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'just', 'idea', 'violence', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'one.The', 'DVD', 'film', ""n't"", 'feature', 'packed', 'one', 'tiny', 'featurette', 'devoted', 'barely', 'detailed', 'making-of', 'more', 'interesting', 'vignette', 'focusing', 'tattoos', 'Mortensen', 'character', 'signification', 'main', 'beef', 'disc', 'lack', 'Cronenberg', 'commentary', 'one', 'few', 'directors', 'never', 'fail', 'give', 'great', 'insight', 'work.This', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'film', 'presented', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'transfer', 'decent', 'sound', 'mix', 'few', 'extras', 'smell', 'special', 'edition', 'release', 'somewhere', 'line', ""'d"", 'give', 'DVD', 'pass', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'film']",N/A
1119581,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000YENUI6,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[0, 0]","David ""Bloodthirsty"" Cronenberg weaves a Russian Mafia story with slashed throats, seedy characters and an unclad Viggo Mortensen. Trying hard to mimic the sincerity and violent appeal of The Godfather, while adding occasional helpings of dramatic revenge and redemption, Eastern Promises is incredibly entertaining and sadly short-lived. So much potential lays in the crafty construction of the dashing, cool and baleful lead character, yet the film abruptly resolves with a succinct running time and too-brief satisfaction.Anna (Naomi Watts) discovers the diary of a young girl who dies at her hospital, leaving a newborn baby behind. In her attempts to get the mysterious Russian book translated, she comes across the deceptively calm Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who has insidious ties with the Eastern European crime syndicate Vory V Zakone, and may be involved with the pregnant girl's death. Semyon's brash son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and his menacingly arcane chauffeur Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) must decide with whom their allegiances lay as bodies pile up and secrets become uncovered.Viggo Mortensen's performance is unabashedly outstanding, and tops his previous role in Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"". Both characters carry sordid pasts and troubled consciences, but Eastern Promises' Nikolai exudes slickness with his snazzy black getup and unflinching, piercing gaze. He is the ultimate dark-robed gangster henchman, and grabs the viewer's attention like a knife to the eye. From the moment he is introduced, subtleties and foreshadowing elude to a deeper and more complex character than what is so suavely displayed on the calmly cold exterior.If violence begets realism then Eastern Promises is as real as it gets. Cronenberg's penchant for delivering imagery unlike any seen before is certainly evident here, this time in the form of a bathhouse fight sequence that transcends violence as we know it. A gritty air of believability draws us into the seedy underworld of the Russian Mafia that Cronenberg has created and scathingly dark images keep reality cemented wherever the masterful director chooses. It's not quite violence for violence's sake, (though it comes ever so close) and this history of violence demands our attention - and gets it. A powerful tool for commanding seriousness, such brazen displays of carnage from an unflinching camera seem destined for cathartic release, though when none is truly offered, audiences may have to create their own at the highest point of the excessive brutality. Other than the aforementioned scene of agonizingly vicious bloodshed, Eastern Promises actually feels lacking in an overall body count, as one would hope to follow Nikolai in a journey of vengeance and usurpation, but the real rampage against villainy likely lies just beyond the end credits.The dark and brooding world of the Russian Mafia is not one we're used to seeing, and such a fascinating existence requires an epic story. At a running time shy of two hours however, Cronenberg's foray into this seedy underworld feels sadly cut short and truncated at its climax. Before the brutal power struggle can come full circle, the film is over and we're left briefly satisfied while quickly realizing we want more. Eastern Promises is a fitting title as it does just that - it promises an epic story of mystery, deception, and revenge, but doesn't quite deliver as much as it should. Regardless, fans of the genre and Cronenberg's style will be delighted to see just how far the director pushes the boundaries of violence to tell an intriguingly morbid tale of survival.- The Massie Twins",4,Eastern Promises Movie Review,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,3630,"['David', 'Bloodthirsty', 'Cronenberg', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'story', 'slashed', 'throats', 'seedy', 'characters', 'unclad', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Trying', 'hard', 'mimic', 'sincerity', 'violent', 'appeal', 'Godfather', 'adding', 'occasional', 'helpings', 'dramatic', 'revenge', 'redemption', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'sadly', 'short-lived', 'So', 'much', 'potential', 'lays', 'crafty', 'construction', 'dashing', 'cool', 'baleful', 'lead', 'character', 'film', 'abruptly', 'succinct', 'running', 'time', 'too-brief', 'satisfaction.Anna', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'diary', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'hospital', 'leaving', 'newborn', 'baby', 'attempts', 'get', 'mysterious', 'Russian', 'book', 'translated', 'deceptively', 'calm', 'Semyon', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'who', 'insidious', 'ties', 'Eastern', 'European', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Vory', 'V', 'Zakone', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'death', 'Semyon', 'brash', 'son', 'Kirill', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'menacingly', 'arcane', 'chauffeur', 'Nikolai', 'Luzhin', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'must', 'decide', 'whom', 'allegiances', 'lay', 'bodies', 'pile', 'up', 'secrets', 'become', 'uncovered.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'performance', 'unabashedly', 'outstanding', 'previous', 'role', 'Cronenberg', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'characters', 'carry', 'sordid', 'pasts', 'troubled', 'consciences', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'Nikolai', 'exudes', 'slickness', 'snazzy', 'black', 'getup', 'unflinching', 'piercing', 'gaze', 'ultimate', 'dark-robed', 'gangster', 'henchman', 'grabs', 'viewer', 'attention', 'knife', 'eye', 'moment', 'introduced', 'subtleties', 'foreshadowing', 'elude', 'deeper', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'what', 'so', 'suavely', 'displayed', 'calmly', 'cold', 'exterior.If', 'violence', 'begets', 'realism', 'then', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'as', 'real', 'Cronenberg', 'penchant', 'delivering', 'imagery', 'seen', 'before', 'certainly', 'evident', 'here', 'time', 'form', 'bathhouse', 'fight', 'sequence', 'violence', 'know', 'A', 'gritty', 'air', 'believability', 'draws', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'Cronenberg', 'created', 'scathingly', 'dark', 'images', 'keep', 'reality', 'cemented', 'masterful', 'director', 'chooses', 'not', 'quite', 'violence', 'violence', 'sake', 'ever', 'so', 'close', 'history', 'violence', 'demands', 'attention', 'powerful', 'tool', 'commanding', 'seriousness', 'such', 'brazen', 'displays', 'carnage', 'unflinching', 'camera', 'seem', 'destined', 'cathartic', 'release', 'when', 'none', 'truly', 'offered', 'audiences', 'may', 'have', 'create', 'own', 'highest', 'point', 'excessive', 'brutality', 'Other', 'aforementioned', 'scene', 'agonizingly', 'vicious', 'bloodshed', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'actually', 'lacking', 'overall', 'body', 'count', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'follow', 'Nikolai', 'journey', 'vengeance', 'usurpation', 'real', 'rampage', 'villainy', 'likely', 'just', 'end', 'credits.The', 'dark', 'brooding', 'world', 'Russian', 'Mafia', 'not', 'one', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'fascinating', 'existence', 'epic', 'story', 'running', 'time', 'shy', 'two', 'hours', 'however', 'Cronenberg', 'foray', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'feels', 'sadly', 'cut', 'short', 'truncated', 'climax', 'brutal', 'power', 'struggle', 'can', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'film', ""'re"", 'left', 'briefly', 'satisfied', 'quickly', 'realizing', 'want', 'more', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'fitting', 'title', 'just', 'epic', 'story', 'mystery', 'deception', 'revenge', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deliver', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'Regardless', 'fans', 'genre', 'Cronenberg', 'style', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'director', 'boundaries', 'violence', 'tell', 'intriguingly', 'morbid', 'tale', 'survival.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

1119583,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000YENUI6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","From the first frames, ""Eastern Promises"" grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.""A History of Violence"" is one of my favorite films. Director David Cronenberg brings together a top-notch cast, including Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello as a married couple living in small town America who has to contend with some new and unexpected violence. William Hurt turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a mobster and Ed Harris is pretty scary as a determined gangster ready to extract revenge for past misdeeds. What makes ""Violence"" so great is Cronenberg's ability to make everything seem so real. We believe Mortensen and Bello are married. They are sexy, happy, love each other, have kids they love, seem content. When the act of violence occurs, and Mortensen's character becomes a hero, he earns unwanted media attention leading to a confrontation with the gangsters. As the danger escalates, and secrets are revealed, we care more and more about Mortensen's and Bello's characters. Is the film violent? Yes, but these scenes play a significant role in the overall story. Amazingly, ""A History of Violence"" is based on a graphic novel.Cronenberg and Mortensen apparently liked working  together so well they reteam for ""Eastern Promises"".Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife at a hospital in London, treats a young pregnant woman a few nights before Christmas. When the mother dies, the midwife looks through her belongings, trying to find the address of family, to care for the newborn child. All she finds is a diary filled with entries written in Russian and a business card for a restaurant called Trans-Siberian. The next day, she rides her motorcycle to this restaurant and meets the owner, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl). He is preparing a large feast for his extended family but can spare a few moments. He listens to Anna's story and is sorry he can't help. Anna thanks him for his time and mentions she will have her uncle translate the girl's diary, to see if they can find an address. Diary? Semyon tells her to bring the diary to him the next day, he will help translate it. As she leaves the restaurant, Anna meets Nikolai (Mortensen) and Kiril (Vincent Cassel). Kiril is the son of Semyon and considers himself the prince of the crime family his father has built. Nikolai is his friend, and a `driver' for the organization. Anna realizes these people are part of the Russian mob, but continues to run into them, ignoring her mother's pleas to stay away. As if the problem of the dead girl is not enough, Semyon must deal with Kiril's murder of a Chechen gangster. How can he protect his son?I read a story about ""Eastern Promises"" quoting Cronenberg disputing the film is very violent. His argument was something along the lines of ""There are only three scenes of violence"". It's enough, David. It's enough. Cronenberg is a very good director, one of the most consistent working in film today. When he makes a film, he strives to make it as authentic as possible. If the film contains violence, he wants it to be authentic. Those three scenes are graphic, scary and very believable because they are portrayed in such a believable fashion. This is not the only aspect of the film worth mentioning, and the violence is an integral part of the story and these characters lives, but these scenes will linger in your memory for a while, much as they have mine. One scene in particular is so memorable, and something I am sure you have never seen before, that it might just become one of those scenes people keep referring to. It involves Nikolai fighting with some gangsters, in a steam bath, and Nikolai is buck-naked. Yes, Viggo Mortensen is buck-naked. I think I just sold a number of tickets. I want a commission.But Cronenberg doesn't shrink away from showing the consequences of violence. If someone gets slashed with a razor, they bleed. If someone gets punched, you almost feel it in your gut. Anyone who has seen any of Cronenberg's other films realizes this is mild in comparison to some of the things he has showed in his earlier work. But it is no less effective considering his current films deal with more real people and their situations.Cronenberg has really been exploring the relationships of his characters in his last few films, to a greater extent than he used to. Or perhaps his skill has developed to the point where these elements of his films seem to take a more prominent role. In either case, his films seem more human, the characters more vulnerable.One such character is Nikolai, played by Viggo Mortensen. Mortensen's roles in each of Cronenberg's films are similar in one regard; each man has a streak of vulnerability. In ""A History of Violence"", it is much more noticeable. In ""Eastern Promises"", Nikolai is a tough guy, a `driver' who processes their victims to make sure they are unidentifiable. But there are moments when we become aware of his vulnerability. When he meets Anna, he tries to protect her from what he knows is about to happen. He realizes she is an honest person, a nice person, and doesn't belong in this world.Nikolai's vulnerability is almost always revealed just before or just after an act of violence which helps to show why he is so good at what he does, why he is such a ferocious fighter, determined to win. He has to prove he is a tough guy, to stay in this crowd.As the film continues, we begin to learn little things about Nikolai, making him a more complex character. Nikolai is very interested in becoming a soldier for this `family' and will do just about anything anyone tells him to. This means he has to listen to Kiril and follow his sometimes crazy, out of left field instructions. He also has to do whatever Semyon says, to prove he is a worthy addition to the family. But why is he so interested in joining this family?Naomi Watts does a good job as Anna, the second generation Russian who is completely British. When she initially confronts this problem, she cares for the dead girl. But she goes beyond this, to try to help reunite her orphaned girl with family for more complex reasons. We learn she may have more in common with this girl, giving them a stronger bond, making her efforts more meaningful.Anna lives with her mother (Sinead Cusack) who worries about her daughter's involvement with these people. She knows they are part of the Vory V Zakone brotherhood and her late husband related stories about their notorious deeds. Her brother-in-law, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) is a more recent Russian immigrant and stays with them on a frequent basis. When he first learns of the diary, he takes a look through the pages and becomes horrified at what is described. He wants nothing to do with it. But then his interest gets the better of him. When he realizes whom the young lady was dealing with, he tries to protect Anna, as much as an old man can.Armin Mueller- Stahl (""Avalon"", ""The Music Box"", ""Shine"") plays Semyon, the head of this organized crime family. His ornate, elaborate restaurant is both a sanctuary and a place to hold court. Filled with rich red velvet, silver place settings, huge paintings and tapestries, it looks like a restaurant that has been around a long, long time. How else could it make any money? But it also looks like a festive place, a place for family celebrations and parties. Semyon is the head of this empire and he reflects all of these images as well. He is the benevolent host, the stern businessman, and the dangerous head of a criminal organization.Mueller - Stahl is very good, perhaps Best Supporting Actor good. Semyon is a man of many faces and Mueller - Stahl is able to portray these in a way making his character both more realistic and more interesting. When he first meets Anna, we realize he is holding back information, trying to see what she has. When he realizes she has the young girl's diary, he tries to get it from her through friendly persuasion. He doesn't want to harm her. But we know he could. He simply wants to protect himself, his family and his `family'. And we recognize that he will do whatever is necessary to do this.Semyon is the head of the organized crime family, but has to play ambassador to the other people in the family. He has to pay heed to what they want and need. But if Semyon wants something done. It gets done. Semyon is an interesting character because Mueller - Stahl is able to make all of the different facets of his character known, yet in a subtle way.And Semyon has to deal with his son, Kiril. Played by Vincent Cassel (""Read My Lips"", ""Derailed""), Kiril is the least successful character. The most dramatic, he is also the most excitable, and can be seen as the most over dramatic. I get it. He is supposed to be immature, impulsive and insecure. But Cassel waves his arms around like a cartoon character. Kiril is over the top, but we also get it, a little, so this makes up for the over-the-top aspect, a little.I have given a number of reasons in support of my claim that Cronenberg is one of the best filmmakers working today. Let me close with one last reason. As we watch ""Eastern Promises"", a sly shift in the narrative happens. Actually, there are a few. In the hands of a less accomplished filmmaker, these moments would simply fall apart and make us groan. In ""Eastern Promises"", they serve to excite the viewer of the possibilities. Naturally, to talk about either, and they are related, in a way, would spoil them. You shall have to experience them for yourselves.",4,Grabs You By The Throat And Doesn't Let Go,1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,9458,"['first', 'frames', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'grabs', 'throat',

While we see the usual characters in most gangster movies, i.e. the good gangster, the bad gangster, a girl and the big bad wolf, these key characters were enough to keep the story flowing from start to finish. The opening sequence catches your attention straightaway and you expect no-holds-barr action from then on. All said, the story didn't have continuous scenes of senseless violence. Every scene seemed measured and inserted only to give the story a true representation of what each character was after. Though at times, Naomi Watts' character did seem a little weak as if nothing much was written for her but it was merely understandable as she is nothing but a mere innocent mortal caught in the Russian web of deceit.

The character Tom Stall (portrayed by Vigo) became more and more interesting as the tallies of personal viewings went onward and upward, and the little things Cronenberg brought to the table were much more amazing than I first thought. The ideals denoted in a simple array of light and dark, the layers of persona wrapped inside a puzzle that was more interesting as it was poked at and slowly drew moths to its flame, and this seemed all-the-more promising when Eastern promises debuted.Cronenberg and Mortenson; I never thought that one would act as a tributary that expressed itself through-and-through.In Eastern Promises, the viewer is again given a puzzle and asked to see it through by starting them off with a pregnant ""woman"" (her age is a sad affair in and of itself) begging for someone to help her. By the end of the day she is dead, there is an Eastern European baby that sets unclaimed, and one doctor that wonders what this all means. Helping her find footing amongst the broken pieces of this ""woman's"" life is a diary find amongst her thins, and the trail of breadcrumbs the book (written in a language she can not translate) leads her to some REALLY bad people with REALLY bad habits.You really have to love Cronenberg's idea of what the baddies do.When watching Eastern Promises, I felt that the movie engaged me from the get-go and asking me deeper rooted questions along the way. It asked how far a person should go to do something they believed in, and it asked how much someone should sacrifice when dealing with all types of proverbial devils that did something you found hard to ignore. I personally liked that because, much like History of Violence, it engaged a viewer on a mainstream front and it allowed a person to question the legitimacy of the way the characters saw the world. Chronenberg likes duality of things, too, and that duality sometimes works as the stepping stones to help a viewer connect with the idea a director is portraying. Seeing the ""mafia"" going to town on a set of fingers and then setting up a child's party by putting balloons on a ceiling - the notion of family and the notion of loyalty may become extreme depending on the moment BUT you can see what makes it important.Ideas like this become the gateway drugs that make some terrible things almost understandable and Cronenberg makes me happy with the way this comes through.The same can be said with the people on the masks of both horror and hero, with Vigo leading the way and really pulling off his role. When I heard that he would be adding ""accent"" to the role I was somewhat afraid, knowing how he had done a lot of things well but not really envisioning him wearing a chilling vocal overcoat cast of the Eastern European persuasion, but he as amazing as it did so. Equally impressive was the persona he took on; tattooed to the gills and seemingly Siberian in the cold manner with which he went about his work, he sold the role and added in feelings I was unaccustomed to in that type of killer. The rest of the cast was solid as well, making the world Cronenberg crafted one that I could see existing.Well worth seeing, gory plus story plus a little something-something that detaches digits at an alarming speed; to me that's everything a Holiday tale requires and especially so when you tire of the tinsel and the Carolers and all that other frill.",5,When they offer you The Stars,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,3480,"['When', 'Vigo', 'Cronenberg', 'teamed', 'up', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'was', 'intrigued', 'house', 'two', 'built', 'character', 'Tom', 'Stall', 'portrayed', 'Vigo', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'interesting', 'tallies', 'personal', 'viewings', 'went', 'onward', 'upward', 'little', 'things', 'Cronenberg', 'brought', 'table', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'amazing', 'first', 'thought', 'ideals', 'denoted', 'simple', 'array', 'light', 'dark', 'layers', 'persona', 'wrapped', 'puzzle', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'poked', 'slowly', 'drew', 'moths', 'flame', 'seemed', 'all-the-more', 'promising', 'when', 'Eastern', 'debuted.Cronenberg', 'Mortenson', 'never', 'thought', 'one', 'would', 'act', 'tributary', 'expressed', 'through-and-through.In', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'viewer', 'again', 'given', 'puzzle', 'asked', 'see', 'starting', 'off', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'age', 'sad', 'affair', 'begging', 'someone', 'help', 'end', 'day', 'dead', 'Eastern', 'European', 'baby', 'unclaimed', 'one', 'doctor', 'what', 'Helping', 'find', 'footing', 'broken', 'pieces', 'woman', 'life', 'diary', 'find', 'thins', 'trail', 'book', 'written', 'language', 'can', 'not', 'translate', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'people', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'habits.You', 'really', 'have', 'love', 'Cronenberg', 'idea', 'what', 'baddies', 'do.When', 'watching', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'felt', 'movie', 'engaged', 'get-go', 'asking', 'rooted', 'questions', 'way', 'asked', 'how', 'far', 'person', 'should', 'go', 'do', 'something', 'believed', 'asked', 'how', 'much', 'someone', 'should', 'sacrifice', 'when', 'dealing', 'types', 'proverbial', 'devils', 'did', 'something', 'found', 'hard', 'ignore', 'personally', 'liked', 'much', 'History', 'Violence', 'engaged', 'viewer', 'mainstream', 'front', 'allowed', 'person', 'question', 'legitimacy', 'way', 'characters', 'saw', 'world', 'Chronenberg', 'duality', 'things', 'too', 'duality', 'sometimes', 'stepping', 'stones', 'help', 'viewer', 'connect', 'idea', 'director', 'portraying', 'Seeing', 'mafia', 'going', 'town', 'set', 'fingers', 'then', 'setting', 'up', 'child', 'party', 'putting', 'balloons', 'ceiling', 'notion', 'family', 'notion', 'loyalty', 'may', 'become', 'extreme', 'depending', 'moment', 'BUT', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'gateway', 'drugs', 'make', 'terrible', 'things', 'almost', 'understandable', 'Cronenberg', 'happy', 'way', 'through.The', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'people', 'masks', 'horror', 'hero', 'Vigo', 'leading', 'way', 'really', 'pulling', 'off', 'role', 'When', 'heard', 'would', 'be', 'adding', 'accent', 'role', 'was', 'somewhat', 'afraid', 'knowing', 'how', 'had', 'done', 'lot', 'things', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'envisioning', 'wearing', 'chilling', 'vocal', 'overcoat', 'cast', 'Eastern', 'European', 'persuasion', 'as', 'amazing', 'did', 'so', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'was', 'persona', 'took', 'tattooed', 'gills', 'seemingly', 'Siberian', 'cold', 'manner', 'went', 'work', 'sold', 'role', 'added', 'feelings', 'was', 'unaccustomed', 'type', 'killer', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'world', 'Cronenberg', 'crafted', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'existing.Well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'gory', 'story', 'little', 'something-something', 'digits', 'alarming', 'speed', 'everything', 'Holiday', 'tale', 'especially', 'so', 'when', 'tire', 'tinsel', 'Carolers', 'other', 'frill']",N/A

As with their previous collaboration, Mortensen plays  conflicted character Nikolai a member of the Russian mob who crosses paths with a British midwife named Anna (an excellent Naomi Watts) who is much more than the ""driver"" for Russian mob leader Seymon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) he pretends to be.The provocative and moving story has some nice twists and turns in the screenplay by Steven Knight (""Amazing Grace"")but the film truly comes alive due to the strong performances of Mortensen, Watts, Mueller-Stahl and Victor Cassel as Seymon's son Kirill. Featuring a dazzling, brutal and shocking fight sequence set in a steambath (something that Hitchcock in his prime might have tried), Cronenberg creates a fascinating tapestry to hang his often stunning visuals on. He continues to mature and become richer as a film director with the passage of time. A few folks complained about the resolution of the film but I actually felt that the way Cronenberg handled the conclusion was the opposite of a Hollywood ending and worked extremely well.Although a bit skimpy on bonus features, both the HD-DVD combo and regular DVD edition do have solid featurettes on the making of the film. The HD-DVD side of this combo flipper looks marvelous while the regular DVD side (which mirrors the single sided DVD in terms of its look)looks extremely good as well. The first ""Secrets and Stories"" focuses on how Cronenberg brought his unique sensibility to the material and ""Marked for Life"" focuses on the tattoos that play such a key role in the film. Both combined run under 20 minutes and it is very disappointing that Cronenberg did not supply a commentary track (I suspect when Oscar comes calling we will see a ""Special Edition"").""Eastern Promises"" features rich and often stunning performances with Mortensen deftly handling his Russian accent and Watts tackling her British one with equal skill. ""Eastern Promises"" makes for a fascinating bookend with ""No Country For Old Men"" which has a very different story at its core but also focuses on unique characters deftly integrating them into a compelling plot.""Eastern Promises"" might not be for everyone but the stunning performances, deft direction and well written script certainly deserve recognition when it comes to awards time.

In some parts of the world, they don't even have that much.  The title of Eastern Promises relates to people who know happiness doesn't exist in their neighborhood, people whose only hope for a richer, fuller life (or even simply one of content) lies in the West.  The future of promise of those from the East (Russia) grows from stories of America, London and the other major cities of the West.  But all too often, the promise is unfulfilled, as played out in the latest David Cronenberg/Viggo Mortensen collaboration.The diary of a fourteen year old sex slave haunts Eastern Promises.  Her last action on earth was to deliver a child to an idealistic midwife (Naomi Watts), who takes it upon herself to see the child is cared for and to understand more about the young mother.  The more she searches, the uglier the truth becomes, as the pages of her diary recount her plight in the underground prostitution trade from the poorest parts of Russia to the seedy communities in London controlled by Russian mobsters.  Stories of beatings, rapes and forced abortions pale in comparison to the heart-breaking dreams she had about the West, and how those romantic notions were crushed by the ugly truth of her life in London.The girl's diary directs the nurse to one Russian mob family in particular, lead by a charismatic fatherly figure who feigns compassion for the dead girl.  Watts has an encounter with the old man's driver (Mortensen), the central figure in Eastern Promises, a man who quickly becomes torn between the life he knows and what he knows to be right.  When faced with the opportunity to do right by the dead girl, Mortensen distances himself from all responsibility.  As he says, he's just the driver.The resulting story contains tricky twists and dramatic (often brutal) encounters.  As with the last Cronenberg/Viggo film, Eastern Promises is so much more than the violence on screen or even the story it tells.  The film speaks to larger issues about the state of the world, and the responsibility of people in the West to continue being more than just a ""promise"" of a brighter day and a new tomorrow.",5,One of 2007's best,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,2248,"['America', 'much', 'West', ""'re"", 'guaranteed', 'pursuit', 'happiness', 'even', 'just', 'pursuit', 'guaranteed', 'parts', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'much', 'title', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'happiness', ""n't"", 'exist', 'neighborhood', 'people', 'only', 'hope', 'richer', 'fuller', 'life', 'even', 'simply', 'one', 'content', 'West', 'future', 'promise', 'East', 'Russia', 'stories', 'America', 'London', 'other', 'major', 'cities', 'West', 'too', 'often', 'promise', 'unfulfilled', 'played', 'out', 'latest', 'David', 'Cronenberg/Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'collaboration.The', 'diary', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'sex', 'slave', 'haunts', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'last', 'action', 'earth', 'was', 'deliver', 'child', 'idealistic', 'midwife', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'see', 'child', 'cared', 'understand', 'more', 'young', 'mother', 'more', 'uglier', 'truth', 'pages', 'diary', 'recount', 'plight', 'underground', 'prostitution', 'trade', 'poorest', 'parts', 'Russia', 'seedy', 'communities', 'London', 'controlled', 'Russian', 'mobsters', 'Stories', 'beatings', 'rapes', 'forced', 'abortions', 'pale', 'comparison', 'heart-breaking', 'dreams', 'had', 'West', 'how', 'romantic', 'notions', 'were', 'crushed', 'ugly', 'truth', 'life', 'London.The', 'girl', 'diary', 'nurse', 'one', 'Russian', 'mob', 'family', 'particular', 'lead', 'charismatic', 'fatherly', 'figure', 'who', 'compassion', 'dead', 'girl', 'Watts', 'encounter', 'old', 'man', 'driver', 'Mortensen', 'central', 'figure', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'man', 'who', 'quickly', 'torn', 'life', 'what', 'be', 'right', 'When', 'faced', 'opportunity', 'do', 'right', 'dead', 'girl', 'Mortensen', 'responsibility', 'just', 'driver.The', 'resulting', 'story', 'contains', 'tricky', 'twists', 'dramatic', 'often', 'brutal', 'encounters', 'last', 'Cronenberg/Viggo', 'film', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'violence', 'screen', 'even', 'story', 'film', 'larger', 'issues', 'state', 'world', 'responsibility', 'people', 'West', 'continue', 'being', 'more', 'just', 'promise', 'brighter', 'day', 'new', 'tomorrow']",N/A

He gives an award-winning caliber performance as Nikolai, a on the rise chaffeur to a Russian gangster in London.  What makes Viggo's performance great is the control and restraint he delivers as well as the anger and violence he exhibits at other moments.  My two complaints and reason for a four are:  (1)  I thought Naomi Watts was lifeless as a midwife that enters this unseemly underworld of crime.  At times, I was frustrated by her seeming naievete and cluelessness to the situations she put herself in.  (2)  Without revealing any of the ending, I was a bit disappointed in the ending of the movie.  While i don't like neat endings, the ending felt a little too abrupt in many ways and too tidy in others.  Lastly, I felt Cronenberg was more judicious in his use of screen violence in the film.While there were a few hard-to-watch scenes, they contributed to and added dimension to the movie, rather than being gratuitous.

1119593,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B000YENUI6,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[1, 3]","I watched these films one right after the other (""Promises"", first). As they're thematically almost identical, and have the same male lead, it made sense to write a single review covering both. (The ""Promises"" section is at the end, if you're in a hurry.)In ""History"", I'm not giving away any great secret when I reveal that Tom Stall really is a gangster trying to escape his past and lead a decent life. He's ""outed"" when obliged to kill the men robbing his diner, and the TV stories of his heroism come to the attention of those he thought would never be able to locate him. The rest of the film is basically a revenge tale in which Stall is obliged to kill every last one of them, including his brother (an almost-unrecognizable William Hurt, in a performance that sidesteps most of the ""standard-gangster"" clich&eacute;s).The problem is that there's not much else to the story. It's little more than a revenge tale that has no moral force, because Stall truly needs to protect himself and his family. There is no drama without choice. (Roger Ebert's argument that had Joey /truly/ become Tom, he would have died in the diner robbery, is absurd. Tom throws hot coffee at one of the robbers, which /any/ desperate person would have done if they were worried about the lives of those around them. Tom is virtually certain that the younger of the robbers /will/ kill one of his employees, even before he hands over the cash register's contents. This renders pointless any ambiguity about ""who"" Tom really is -- if you know you're going to die, you'll take any chance.)Despite Cronenberg's averral that he wants the audience to identify with Stall's killings (rather than be revulsed by them), so that we have to consider their morality, the /fact/ is that Stall's need to violently defend himself is at least /legally/ justifiable, and the audience is completely on the side of a genuinely reformed gangster from the start. I greatly enjoyed the vicarious pleasure of seeing him off every one of his enemies, and most viewers are likely to cheer rather than turn away.Another problem with ""History"" is the way Stall's wife is so quick to reject him when she learns the truth. We see, in an early sex scene, how much they genuinely care for each other, but even Tom's post-revelation rape (yes), which she thoroughly enjoys, is not enough to bring her to her senses. If Cronenberg is making the trite observation that we never /really/ know the people we live with, it would have been more effective if Stall's wife, though understandably frightened and anguished, were also at least /somewhat/ ambivalent about the situation. How can a woman who says ""You're the best man I've ever known"" be so quick to think the man she's spent almost 20 years with is a monster in disguise? But, no, she firmly rejects him until the final scene (which Cronenberg directs with beautiful restraint). I would have kicked her out and found a more-loyal mate.There's no restraint in Cronenberg's continuing love for explicit gore. In both films people are brutally killed, and Cronenberg doesn't hesitate to show us -- in close-up -- such things as a slit throat pumping blood, or the nearly blown-off jaw of a still-living person. (If you think this is bad, take a look at the deleted scenes from ""The Fly"", some of which would likely have gotten that film an X rating.)If ""A History of Violence"" is about character, rather than plot (as Roger Ebert suggests it is), you coulda fooled /me/. Its ending is largely determined by its beginning, and that is not the substance of character-driven stories. There is one genuinely clever and witty scene in which Stall's son, Jack, verbally humiliates the school bully. But Jack is later obliged to beat up the guy, and Stall is worried about being sued by the kid's parents (!!!).""Eastern Promises"" is about Russian gangsters in London. It, too, is a revenge story, but one of more complexity and subtlety. It has an audience-pleasing twist ending that is at least plausible, if not wholly likely.Morton Vigoro -- I mean, Viggo Mortensen -- is a Russian criminal (Nikolai) who's the ""driver"" for a Russian gangster (Semyon -- Armand Mueller-Stahl) who runs a fine restaurant. Nikolai's tattoos reveal his criminal life; without these tattoos, he wouldn't be trusted, or for that matter, even be considered a criminal at all. When Semyon has had enough of his feckless son Kirill (Vincent Cassell), he agrees to have the kid offed, with Nikolai moving into Kirill's position -- which is what Nikolai has wanted all along. More I cannot say -- other than to be patient with the first few minutes of the film, which at first seem incomprehensible.Unlike ""History"", ""Promises"" /is/ about character, and we're not sure how we're supposed to take Nikolai -- he seems to be a villain with just the faintest trace of a conscience. Kirill is particularly interesting, as his homophobia clearly covers his own sexual confusion. He's obviously in love with Nikolai. Nikolai's feelings about Kirill are not so clear. Is he just using Kirill -- or is he also attracted to him?""Eastern Promises"" is a legitimate drama, and if you can get past Cronenberg's horrifying neck slashings, you'll probably enjoy it.",4,The
