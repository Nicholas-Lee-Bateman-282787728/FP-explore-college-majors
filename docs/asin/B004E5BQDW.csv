1397707,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B004E5BQDW,D. Allen,"[5, 5]","I was skeptical of buying this dvd pack. I had it in my cart and wish list for months and never went through with the purchase. When someone said ""censored"" my immediate thoughts were the Tom & Jerry cartoon dvd pack that took out content in fear of racial stereotypes. I figured that these dvd were somehow altered to be politically correct.After doing some heavy research, I'm not convinced all the negativeness for this dvd are well placed. Reading over the history of how these dvds came to be, MGM first attempted to release season one to test the market to see if the sales were going to be good enough for further releases. The sales failed to meet their expectations and they decided to not release any further seasons. What you have to remember is that this series first aired on Showtime and like other hit Showtime and HBO shows, they managed their way to TV throughout North America. One such place is our nearest neighbor in the north, the Canadians. This series was aired on their TV for quite some time and they have similar rules to our cable TV shows in that they can't show explicit contents. With that in mind, like other TV shows, a Canadian company decided to release this similarly to how a TV show is released on DVD here in the USA. So the reality of it is that The Outer Limits is not really aimed at the American audience. It's a ""foreign"" region one DVD release aimed solely to Canadian viewers who will view the series just like how they remembered and in what you could call in their entirety as they had seen. It just so happen that we, citizens of the USA, get to purchase these thanks to the internet. You will not find any other seasons beyond season one at any retail stores here in the states.With that fact in mind, I never seen the Showtime showing of this series. Remembering back to my to my childhood viewing of these shows, I only ever watched them on SciFi channel every so often. The one episode that made me want to buy this dvd pack was season three Dead Man's Switch. This episode had a lasting impression on me and after years of forgetting about it, I happened to stumble upon this again.Like I said earlier, season one is like the Showtime release in that it has nudity and other adult content. Oddly enough, Canadian has a weird rule for their television. Depending on the time of day, nudity can be be shown on TV so long as it's not sexual in nature. With that in mind, depending on when the episode was aired, you might see some nudity on the other seasons. Bad languages and other TV disapproved items are removed from season two and beyond. One thing you'll notice is that every so often the film fades out or cut as if it is going to go into a commercial break. This is the proof that the seasons were once shown on TV.As indicated, I never seen this on Showtime. So while I dislike the idea that I'm not seeing the entire series as it originally aired, I can't really say that it negatively impacts my viewing of the show. Also keep in mind that while nudity and other adult content are in this series, that doesn't mean that the show was somehow altered. The nudity and languages are rare and you can follow a guide online that explains what content each episode would have. Also, there is a separate DVD release that aims at showing nudity and adult content. The DVD is called ""Sex & Science Fiction"" and you can order it right here on Amazon as well.If this is released in its original content, I will no doubt buy that to compare with this. However, at the current state of the release, I am happy with it. I do have to agree with some reviews that indicate the DVD were poorly packed. The dvds are held onto notches on the sides of the dvd. As such I could never latch it on correctly and in fear of breaking the dvd, I will pack it in a dvd case book that I have.Also negative is that I'm very hard of hearing. I can't hear very well and luckily I have head sets to watch tv. Problem with these dvds is that it doesn't have close captioned or subtitles. So keep that in mind if you have a HOH or deaf person in your house. I know some people like subtitles to pick up some dialog as well so watch out for that fact.Thus far I am loving this series. There are some really good episodes and watching them randomly is really nice. I personally like the series and in the future I hope the original Showtime episodes come out. However at this point and time that is looking very doubtful (MGM attempted to release the series in 2005 and in 2010 the Canadians decided to release) since it's been nearly 9 years since the first season was tested in the market.Overall if you viewed this show on TV or if you really want to watch this series again, this is the best format you can get it in. I heard there are some online airing of it on popular streaming services but I cannot locate them on it anymore. With that in mind, this is the permanent way to watch the series. Just keep in mind that this isn't a USA release and that only season one is the original Showtime release. If you are happy with that, and then you'll be happy with this series.",5,Turned out to be really good,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,5104,"['was', 'skeptical', 'buying', 'dvd', 'pack', 'had', 'cart',

I don't care that the nudity and foul language was cut out, as seems to be a hang-up here. All the better, I feel. I'm not sure why such a negative response for the edits; editing is a pretty common practice for different reasons.  It's not really all that weird or unusual.  Perhaps the Canadians were just shooting for a newer, younger (as well as the former, older) audience.  Anyway, with the edits, then I don't have to worry about anything when any of the kids is wandering about the room. I suppose, if I really wanted to see these girls' nude bodies, I could go elsewhere.  Perhaps a solution would be to offer two versions to make everyone happy.  But enough of that.  Cheer up; it's not all that bad.  We're lucky, I feel, to have what we have of them.I would have loved to have seen the quality in Blu-ray, but perhaps that's for another time. All in all, this is a wonderful buy. I've been wanting it for years, but never had my opportunity until now. And $200 was reasonable for all seven seasons on DVD. I remember when one Fuji VHS blank tape was $20, so this is very good. I did once manage to find the entire series, but after having received it, found it was squashed onto only 9 discs! and came from China (another warning flag!). The quality was pretty horrible and the menu system so deep that it wasn't worth having. As I remember, it also was some horrendous amount of money, $150-$200, or something like that.Well, I'm happy to have the series back and don't mind the minor edits.
