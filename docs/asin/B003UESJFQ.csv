1364788,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003UESJFQ,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","If you've seen `Norma Rae' then you've seen `Made in Dagenham'.  Sure, the stories are different to an extent, and `Made in Dagenham' contains a certain level of spunk that `Norma Rae' didn't (the former being a more dramatically laced film) but the overall conceptual nature of this film mirrors its predecessor.That isn't to say that you shouldn't see this film, because it certainly deserves to be seen, but you may feel as though you've seen it before.`Made in Dagenham' takes place in the 60's, during the Dagenham strike in England when female workers at the Ford plant become enraged over unfair treatment.  The unlikely hero, or should I say heroine, or our story is Rita.  Rita is a mother, a wife and a friend, but most of all she is a levelheaded woman who just wants to be valued for her work, not degraded because of her sex.  So, after months of being strung along by the Ford company, Rita and her co-workers rise up and fight back by putting an immediate stop on their work and campaigning for equal pay.  This, of course, puts a strain on relationships, including that of Rita and her supportive husband Eddie.But it's all for the greater good.Now, while I initially began this review by calling out the film for basically being a remake of `Norma Jean', I also said that this film contained spunk, and that spunk goes a long way to making this film stand alone.  The cheeky nature of the time and place (1960's England) coupled with the vivacious personalities cloaked in gorgeous attire with glossy lips and perfectly sculpted hair, not to mention the authenticated set pieces really help `send you there'.  The script is familiar yet it also contains the right amount of wit within the dialog to keep the audience enthused.  And then you have the cast; equal part veterans and rising stars.  Bob Hoskins and Miranda Richardson develop nice supporting players who are refreshing and memorable; Richardson taking off heads and letting them roll while Hoskins downplays his usual demeanor for a more paternal and genuine performance.  Then you have Andrea Riseborough and Jamie Winstone (daughter to sexy beast Ray Winstone) slinky their sexiness across the screen.  But the film really rests on the shoulders of two very capable women.  Rosamund Pike has just a handful of scenes, but she captures the attention of the audience and remains the most memorable part of the film.  Sally Hawkins has been on the tips of everyone's tongues after her brazen performance in 08's `Happy-Go-Lucky', and she matches her initial promise with another powerful yet drastically different performance.  She beautifully layers this woman and underlines her convictions as well as her insecurities.Bravo!In the end I highly recommend this film.  It rises above its familiarity by injecting personality into every frame.",5,Let spunk be thy savior...,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,2820,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Made', 'Dagenham', 'Sure', 'stories', 'are', 'different', 'extent', 'Made', 'Dagenham', 'certain', 'level', 'spunk', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'did', ""n't"", 'former', 'being', 'more', 'dramatically', 'laced', 'film', 'overall', 'conceptual', 'nature', 'film', 'predecessor.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'certainly', 'be', 'seen', 'may', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.', 'Made', 'Dagenham', 'place', '60', 'Dagenham', 'strike', 'England', 'when', 'female', 'workers', 'Ford', 'plant', 'become', 'enraged', 'unfair', 'treatment', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'should', 'say', 'heroine', 'story', 'Rita', 'Rita', 'mother', 'wife', 'friend', 'most', 'levelheaded', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'valued', 'work', 'not', 'degraded', 'sex', 'So', 'months', 'being', 'strung', 'Ford', 'company', 'Rita', 'co-workers', 'rise', 'up', 'fight', 'back', 'putting', 'immediate', 'stop', 'work', 'campaigning', 'equal', 'pay', 'course', 'strain', 'relationships', 'including', 'Rita', 'supportive', 'husband', 'Eddie.But', 'greater', 'good.Now', 'initially', 'began', 'review', 'calling', 'out', 'film', 'basically', 'being', 'remake', 'Norma', 'Jean', 'also', 'said', 'film', 'contained', 'spunk', 'spunk', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'film', 'stand', 'alone', 'cheeky', 'nature', 'time', 'place', '1960', 'England', 'coupled', 'vivacious', 'personalities', 'cloaked', 'gorgeous', 'attire', 'glossy', 'lips', 'perfectly', 'sculpted', 'hair', 'not', 'mention', 'authenticated', 'set', 'pieces', 'really', 'help', 'send', 'script', 'familiar', 'yet', 'also', 'right', 'amount', 'wit', 'dialog', 'keep', 'audience', 'enthused', 'then', 'have', 'cast', 'equal', 'part', 'veterans', 'rising', 'stars', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'develop', 'nice', 'supporting', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'refreshing', 'memorable', 'Richardson', 'taking', 'off', 'heads', 'letting', 'roll', 'Hoskins', 'usual', 'demeanor', 'more', 'paternal', 'genuine', 'performance', 'Then', 'have', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough', 'Jamie', 'Winstone', 'daughter', 'sexy', 'beast', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'slinky', 'sexiness', 'screen', 'film', 'really', 'shoulders', 'two', 'very', 'capable', 'women', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'just', 'handful', 'scenes', 'attention', 'audience', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'been', 'tips', 'everyone', 'tongues', 'brazen', 'performance', '08', 'Happy-Go-Lucky', 'initial', 'promise', 'powerful', 'yet', 'drastically', 'different', 'performance', 'beautifully', 'woman', 'convictions', 'as', 'well', 'insecurities.Bravo', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'familiarity', 'injecting', 'personality', 'frame']",N/A

That's a shame, since the acting is generally excellent. The film is an interesting piece of social history, taking us back to Britain in the 1960s when men were men, women knew their place and the industrial sector ruled supreme. A group of women at Ford's enormous Dagenham car (auto) plant go on strike to demand equal pay with the male workers. The male-dominated union pretends to back them while in reality trying to undermine the strikers, since they fear it could derail various work grievances presented by male workers. The movie quickly bogs down in cliches. We meet the quiet female worker who slowly discovers she can be an activist, the union activist raised by a single mother who secretly helps the women, the upper class wife of a Ford executive whose husband treats her like dirt and who helps the strikers, the chief striker's husband, who resents what she's doing but slowly realises she's right, the hard-nosed woman who turns out to have a heart of .... and so on and so on. The women eventually win out and it's a heart-warming tale.

It was the time of Stonewall and the antiwar protests in America and so perhaps too few people appreciated the importance of this rebellion - a strike of equal rights, equal pay, and a statement against sexual discrimination at the Ford car factory. The employed women of the town were the ones responsible for creating the upholstery for the cars, but when one Rita O'Grady (Sally Hawkins) took on the inequalities  she manage to become the spokeswoman for the female workers and the revolt was successful in settling a longterm problem.The cast of this quiet little powerhouse of a movie includes the brilliance of Miranda Richardson, Bob Hoskins, Rosamund Pike, Rupert Graves, Andrea Riseborough,  Jaime Winstone and many others.

1364792,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B003UESJFQ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 3]","This is a film that will mean nostalgia for the people of my generation, but it is a perfect example in political and working class history if one is needed for those who are in the field every day. The subject itself is an example of historical courage: sex equality as it was called in those days of early fighting for it. We would say today pay equality, gender equality, equality at the work place and on the labor market. But it is the same and that fight in 1968 was an avant-garde fight in the whole world, and it was in England in an American factory, Ford.187 women employed in one Ford factory in England decide to go on strike for equal pay and at once hypocrisy, at least, is revealed among most people. Management takes it with condescendence and sexism. These strikers are just women. Then they take it in the worst egotistic way possible: it is not the case of 187 women that is considered but the fate of millions of women who are going to ask the same if these 187 women get it. And they will try to blackmail the Labor government of Great Britain to get their way.But the second strong point of these women is that in spite of some rebuttal from the sexist bigots, they are supported by men in spite of the hardships it represents since management decides to lock out the workers within forty-eight hours. Men will support in spite of the suffering of their families and children. It is this support that these women will get from the congress of their national union, two thirds against one. The bigots are not isolated but they are clearly defeated.The main point of these women is that they fight for a new right that is for everyone in the end, and not to defend an advantage of some that turns out to be a privilege. In 1968 it was a fair period when new rights were conquered for everyone. We were far ahead of a more recent period when in front of an extremely hard financial crisis some minorities refuse to be realistic and defend their tremendous advantages when millions don't even have one half, when they are not plainly made redundant, of what these privileged people have, like a thirteenth month or even a fourteenth month of salary, the right to retire at fifty or fifty two and so many other unequal advantages.In 1968 equality and justice were fundamental objectives in life provided it was for everyone. History was not made by this or that politician or union leader, not even by this or that minority of fighters. History was made by the general agreement on an objective of justice and equality, and then there is always one man or woman politician who will see his or her career advantage in supporting that objective and the law will go through.That film should make us think of and ponder on the proper attitude we have to defend in a crisis period or in an expansion period in a globalized context. It is so easy to get into some selfish and self-centered defense of one's privileges instead of the general interest, like that of women.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,How women made history against Henry Ford II,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,3002,"['film', 'will', 'mean', 'nostalgia', 'people', 'generation', 'perfect', 'example', 'political', 'working', 'class', 'history', 'one', 'needed', 'who', 'are', 'field', 'day', 'subject', 'example', 'historical', 'courage', 'sex', 'equality', 'was', 'called', 'days', 'early', 'fighting', 'would', 'say', 'today', 'pay', 'equality', 'gender', 'equality', 'equality', 'work', 'place', 'labor', 'market', 'same', 'fight', '1968', 'was', 'avant-garde', 'fight', 'whole', 'world', 'was', 'England', 'American', 'factory', 'Ford.187', 'women', 'employed', 'one', 'Ford', 'factory', 'England', 'decide', 'go', 'strike', 'equal', 'pay', 'once', 'hypocrisy', 'least', 'revealed', 'most', 'people', 'Management', 'condescendence', 'sexism', 'strikers', 'are', 'just', 'women', 'Then', 'take', 'worst', 'egotistic', 'way', 'possible', 'not', 'case', '187', 'women', 'considered', 'fate', 'millions', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'ask', 'same', '187', 'women', 'get', 'will', 'try', 'blackmail', 'Labor', 'government', 'Great', 'Britain', 'get', 'way.But', 'second', 'strong', 'point', 'women', 'spite', 'rebuttal', 'sexist', 'bigots', 'are', 'supported', 'men', 'spite', 'hardships', 'management', 'decides', 'lock', 'out', 'workers', 'forty-eight', 'hours', 'Men', 'will', 'support', 'spite', 'suffering', 'families', 'children', 'support', 'women', 'will', 'get', 'congress', 'national', 'union', 'two', 'thirds', 'one', 'bigots', 'are', 'not', 'isolated', 'are', 'clearly', 'defeated.The', 'main', 'point', 'women', 'fight', 'new', 'right', 'everyone', 'end', 'not', 'defend', 'advantage', 'out', 'be', 'privilege', '1968', 'was', 'fair', 'period', 'when', 'new', 'rights', 'were', 'conquered', 'everyone', 'were', 'far', 'ahead', 'more', 'recent', 'period', 'when', 'front', 'extremely', 'hard', 'financial', 'crisis', 'minorities', 'refuse', 'be', 'realistic', 'defend', 'tremendous', 'advantages', 'when', 'millions', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'one', 'half', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'plainly', 'made', 'redundant', 'what', 'privileged', 'people', 'have', 'thirteenth', 'month', 'even', 'fourteenth', 'month', 'salary', 'right', 'retire', 'fifty', 'fifty', 'two', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'unequal', 'advantages.In', '1968', 'equality', 'justice', 'were', 'fundamental', 'objectives', 'life', 'provided', 'was', 'everyone', 'History', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'politician', 'union', 'leader', 'not', 'even', 'minority', 'fighters', 'History', 'was', 'made', 'general', 'agreement', 'objective', 'justice', 'equality', 'then', 'always', 'one', 'man', 'woman', 'politician', 'who', 'will', 'see', 'career', 'advantage', 'supporting', 'objective', 'law', 'will', 'go', 'through.That', 'film', 'should', 'make', 'think', 'ponder', 'proper', 'attitude', 'have', 'defend', 'crisis', 'period', 'expansion', 'period', 'globalized', 'context', 'so', 'easy', 'get', 'selfish', 'self-centered', 'defense', 'one', 'privileges', 'instead', 'general', 'interest', 'women.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

1364797,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003UESJFQ,Mark Turner,"[2, 2]","There are a number of movies made that feature the real life stories of situations and people involved in them. It may be true that these stories are a bit embellished in an attempt to compact them into anywhere from 90 to 120 minutes, but the story at the heart always remains the same. And when it's a good story it makes the viewer want to find out more. Such is the case with MADE IN DAGENHAM.Set in 1968, the ladies at the Ford plant in Dagenham, England, work just as hard as the men there. Their jobs may be different, but its work, it's difficult and they sweat the same as the men do. The problem is they don't get paid the same. When their local union rep Albert (Bob Hoskins) talks to them about it, they decide to go on a 24 hour strike.The 187 women do so with the support of their fellow workers, the 55,000 men who work there as well at first. They've been told that the reason for the lower pay was the due to the scales established by work performance studies. When they learn the truth, that it is simply because they are female, the women don't take to well to their situation. Instead they decide to continue the strike longer.The woman leading this charge is Rita O'Grady (Sally Hawkins), a mother and wife who finds herself drawn into the role of leader unwillingly at first. As shop steward she usually drops back to allow her friend to keep things on track. But with the convincing of Albert who sees her as a natural leader, she takes on the job of seeing to it that their grievances are met.The one thing that's interesting here is that it's not just the factory that chooses to abuse these women. Their own union does so as well, agreeing to put their case on a back burner in an effort to get other grievances dealt with first. And as the film progresses, you see the upper echelon of the union choose to protect his own deals, protecting himself rather than stand up for what's right for his members.But the strike takes its toll on the members. To being with the loss in pay affects all their way of life. And when the stockpiled goods these women made runs dry, rather than give in the company just lays off everyone. This leads to a great deal of resentment among the workers, mostly the men. They seem to have forgotten the women that stood behind them each time they went on strike, including Rita's husband.Ford plays hardball with these women, doing their best to break the strike. Their greatest fear is that if they change their rules here, they'll have to do so all over the world. The costs would be high and they aren't willing to do so. So much so that their representative even meets with British Secretary of State Barbara Mason (Miranda Richardson) and basically threatens to pull out all of their factories if she doesn't make this stop.The struggle seen here is not only interesting but inspiring as well. These women were not striking for some penny ante change 5 years down the line in a contract but for the simple right to be paid what they were worth, exactly what the men were being paid. And the sacrifices they made to get there were astonishing and painful.Keep in mind, this is the 60s and at the time women were not being paid equally not just here but anywhere. Even though I grew up during this time I was stunned to think it hadn't happened yet. How could it be that equal pay did not equal wages? Even more amazing is to consider the fact that in some cases it hasn't changed.The film could be one of those drawn out boring biopics that seem to take forever to get to the point. Instead it starts with the discussion of the problem and moves it forward, focusing not just on the strike but how it affects everyone. This makes for an interesting film that holds your attention throughout and never gets boring.The acting is above par. Sally Hawkins does a great job as Rita, a woman who simply does what's right. She doesn't set out to be a hero, she reluctantly takes on the role of one, but when she sets her mind to it she follows through to the end. The rest of the cast does an equally outstanding job, showing varying examples of the women involved and how they cope with their day to day struggle.I think the best thing about this film was its showing that there could be wrong on both sides of the coin. Rather than depict the company as only bad guy in the film they offer us a look at the fact that even the union at the time was unwilling at first to help their own members.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[21, 23]","MADE IN DAGENHAM is sort of a British version of NORMA RAE.The film, based on a true story, is set in the late 1960s.  It tells of a group of English women, employed at the Ford Motor Factory, who took on management and their own union by going out on strike, insisting on equal pay for equal work.The always charming Sally Hawkins, playing an ordinary working class wife and mother, becomes the unexpected leader of the revolt, encouraged by her sympathetic union representative (Bob Hoskins) and, surprisingly, the attractive wife (Rosamund Pike) of the plant's manager, a highly educated, intelligent woman who, as a female, feels the same lack of respect from the men in her life.Like the Sally Field classic, MADE IN DAGENHAM is one of those ""stand up and cheer"" movies that climaxes when the striking women meet with Miranda Richardson, the British Secretary of State.  The film has a superb screenplay by William Ivory and was directed by Nigel Cole.  Also in the well-chosen cast are Geraldine James, Jamie Winstone, Rupert Graves, Nicola Duffett and Richard Schiff, who plays the tough American Ford representative, sent to the UK to put those striking women in their place.My only complaint with this otherwise excellent entertainment is the fact that, because England and the United States do not share a common language, some of the dialogue is difficult to understand.

The story revolves around the female Ford factory workers in Dagenham England who finally stood up to say no more second class treatment. Their rebellion started the equal pay for women movement. This occurred in the tumulteous year of 1968. The events portrayed here surely have some dramatic license added in. No matter it is fun and enjoyable. Sally Hawkins plays a Ford worker who stands up to lead the strikers but faces resentment and anger from all directions, even in her own family. The always beautiful Rosamund Pike plays an educated and refined woman married to a person of prominence who opposes the factory women. Bob Hoskins is the only person in the male dominated union who encourages the woman to really go for it. The other fun element is the music of 1968 which is featured to great effect. Not music like the Stones & Beatles that we still here all the time. Forgotten hit singles like ""Israelites"" ""all or nothing"" and ""wooly bully"" are featured.

I don't think either of us were expecting to like it as much as we did.  It really was wonderful.  It is difficult to rate a film because it really is just a matter of personal taste.  As much as we liked it someone else has probably given the film a lousy review...although I really can't understand why.  The acting was great....and baring in mind that this film is based on a true story it really is quite inspiring as these ladies really had a tremendous challenge...there is nothing corny or sappy about the film.  I watched it with my fiance and he enjoyed it as much as I did so I would say it definitely is not just a film for women.  To us, if for no other reason, this is a great human interest story which all can enjoy and find inspiration in the determination of a small group of people who sought to change an old and long out dated system...they had their work cut out for them and had no way to know after going through allot of difficulty & dead ends what their outcome would be.
