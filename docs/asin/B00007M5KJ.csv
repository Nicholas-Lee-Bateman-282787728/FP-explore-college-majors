This surely inexpensively made movie, about a party game played one New Year's Eve in a spacious old mansion, with the surprising and deadly results coming forth the following New Year's, in the same setting, is fun. It keeps one guessing, although the screenplay could have done more to hide what the outcomes for each protagonist would be. Given the premise of this little sexo-psycho-thriller, some humour would have made the frolics all that more spicy; this kind of film needs a touch of kitsch to realise fully the potential.Nick Stahl is front and foremost throughout the film and he remains alive, as the others, really and playfully, intimately are and are not as the film progresses. This gives Stahl more screen time than some of the other actors receive during the ""dark and stormy night"" of bitchy, vicious, and bloody doings in on the fatal night of its main action right to the very end -- although, at last, Stahl is not among the living any longer at the motion picture's very conclusion (which comes as a surprise, even if so much of the other workings-out of the plot do not). Stahl looks good, boyishly handsome in his usual ""negligently elegant"" kind of way, and his acting is excellent. The other actors and actresses are variable, some better than others, none of them so good as Stahl is.This one is worth it to pick up if purchased inexpensively or rented. (These kinds of plots, after all, do not hold up to too many viewings.)

It is about this game that six friends all played, concerning different sins that they had commited. One year later, at their one year reunion get-together, cards are delivered to the house, all containing a certain word describing each person's sin (Rapist, Prostitute, etc.). Soon people start to die one by one, with a nice twist near the end. A bit funny at times, very entertaining, and excellently acted. The plot needs a few more complications, but, in the end, pulls through. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is fans of the actors or actresses, or liked movies such as ""Cruel Intentions,"" ""The Incrowd""(also starring Laurie Heuring.), and other sexual thrillers.
