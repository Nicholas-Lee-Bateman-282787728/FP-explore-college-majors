708181,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000069I1W,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Gena Rowlands' son Nick Cassavetes made his directorial debut with this sympathetic look at a kind hearted mother finally taking the time to find herself.  The film is nothing extraordinary, but the stellar performances by the cast, especially Mrs. Rowlands herself, elevate this tale to something truly memorable.Mildred Hawks is a devoted mother who finds herself being used by her daughter Annie, who refuses to take responsibility for herself.  In the wake of her husband's death her family is torn and she finds herself lonely and searching for something, anything, to fill the emptiness.  When she meets Monica Warren, her abused next-door-neighbor, her emptiness starts to fade.  Monica, having recently split from her husband, needs someone to watch her young son J.J. and Mildred is more than willing.  The two form a very close bond, and her relationship with the pair finally helps her to see that a life of serving others is only truly rewarding when you find time to serve yourself.The story is a simple one, and it has a very unpredictable ending which I truly enjoyed, but it lives and dies with the beautiful performances that dwell within its running time.Gena Rowlands is a great veteran actress who knows how to develop a natural performance out of any character.  Mildred is your average grandmotherly woman who has spent her entire life serving others and it is finally taking its toll.  Her daughter is ungrateful, her son is demanding and spoiled and her home is empty.  Rowlands allows these circumstances to read all over her face.  Her interactions with young Jake Lloyd are also a highlight for she is able to act like your typical grandmother, without all the Hollywood stereotypes.  You feel like you know her.  Marisa Tomei (one of my favorite actresses) is phenomenal here, even if at first it doesn't seem like it.  She seems a little all over the place in the beginning, but as the film progresses and her character develops you can see that she has become a product of her upbringing and her unstable environment and she portrays that perfectly.`Unhook the Stars' is not a perfect film, but it is a very good one that will definitely leave you entertained and rather enlightened.  Rowlands and Tomei are a beautiful duo of performers who understand just what is needed to deliver a thoughtful message, and young Jake Lloyd is not only cute as a button but very effective in his role as the little boy who brings these two women together.",4,Sometimes the only way to love others is to finally love yourself...,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,2471,"['Gena', 'Rowlands', 'son', 'Nick', 'Cassavetes', 'made', 'directorial', 'debut', 'sympathetic', 'look', 'kind', 'hearted', 'mother', 'finally', 'taking', 'time', 'find', 'film', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'stellar', 'performances', 'cast', 'especially', 'Mrs.', 'Rowlands', 'elevate', 'tale', 'something', 'truly', 'memorable.Mildred', 'Hawks', 'devoted', 'mother', 'who', 'being', 'used', 'daughter', 'Annie', 'who', 'take', 'responsibility', 'herself', 'wake', 'husband', 'death', 'family', 'torn', 'lonely', 'searching', 'something', 'anything', 'fill', 'emptiness', 'When', 'Monica', 'Warren', 'abused', 'next-door-neighbor', 'emptiness', 'fade', 'Monica', 'having', 'recently', 'split', 'husband', 'someone', 'watch', 'young', 'son', 'J.J.', 'Mildred', 'more', 'willing', 'two', 'form', 'very', 'close', 'bond', 'relationship', 'pair', 'finally', 'see', 'life', 'serving', 'others', 'only', 'truly', 'rewarding', 'when', 'find', 'time', 'serve', 'yourself.The', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'very', 'unpredictable', 'ending', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'dwell', 'running', 'time.Gena', 'Rowlands', 'great', 'veteran', 'actress', 'who', 'how', 'develop', 'natural', 'performance', 'character', 'Mildred', 'average', 'grandmotherly', 'woman', 'who', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'serving', 'others', 'finally', 'taking', 'toll', 'daughter', 'ungrateful', 'son', 'demanding', 'spoiled', 'home', 'empty', 'Rowlands', 'circumstances', 'read', 'face', 'interactions', 'young', 'Jake', 'Lloyd', 'are', 'also', 'highlight', 'able', 'act', 'typical', 'grandmother', 'Hollywood', 'stereotypes', 'feel', 'know', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'phenomenal', 'here', 'even', 'first', ""n't"", 'seem', 'little', 'place', 'beginning', 'film', 'progresses', 'character', 'can', 'see', 'become', 'product', 'upbringing', 'unstable', 'environment', 'perfectly.', 'Unhook', 'Stars', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'will', 'definitely', 'leave', 'entertained', 'rather', 'enlightened', 'Rowlands', 'Tomei', 'are', 'beautiful', 'duo', 'performers', 'who', 'understand', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'deliver', 'thoughtful', 'message', 'young', 'Jake', 'Lloyd', 'not', 'only', 'cute', 'button', 'very', 'effective', 'role', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'two', 'women', 'together']",N/A

Gena Rowlands plays a middle aged mom with no one to care for until she 'adopts' the mixed up mess next door. It's a bit improbable because the LA neighborhood looks pretty upscale and way too expensive for the Marisa Tomei loser and her even worse hubby. Still, I'd rather watch this than a shoot em up with no redeeming social value. It's a decent drama. Just not particularly special.",3,A Bit Icky,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,504,"['emotional', 'manipulations', 'are', 'bit', 'much', 'here', 'cute', 'kid', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'next', 'door', 'party', 'girl', 'mom', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'middle', 'aged', 'mom', 'one', 'care', 'mixed', 'up', 'mess', 'next', 'door', 'bit', 'improbable', 'LA', 'neighborhood', 'pretty', 'upscale', 'way', 'too', 'expensive', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'loser', 'even', 'worse', 'hubby', 'Still', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'shoot', 'up', 'redeeming', 'social', 'value', 'decent', 'drama', 'Just', 'not', 'particularly', 'special']",N/A
708183,ADU5Y4A86JZLP,B000069I1W,C. Cook,"[18, 18]","The ""mature"" years are so often neglected in film, unless it's as the butt of a joke.  Not here, however.  The incomporable Gena Rowlands plays a character whose intelligence and self-possession seem an extension of Rowlands herself, making it a very good fit.  Seeing a woman who has raised her children and is now searching for what to become is a refreshing storyline.  Tomei adds marvelous support as the ""white trash"" neighbor, and I really appreciated how the director never gave us easy answers for these characters.  Tomei never turns into a lady, and Rowlands never quite figures out where she is going:  she merely decides to take the journey.  The character of Tomei's son adds a touching poignancy to the story, highlighting Rowland's search for identity at this late stage in her life.  This film doesn't jump up and tell you what it's about; it quietly presents Rowland's life and lets you figure it out--perhaps this requires a little more thinking than some viewers would like.  Unlike other films that on first viewing seem obtuse, all the answers are there in ""Unhook the Stars"" if the viewer takes time to look for them.  Every performance is subtly nuanced and adds to the theme (a good example is the luncheon scene with the adult son and his wife.  Watch the subtle interplay between those two and you will know all you need to know abou their relationship-and why Rowlands chooses not to live with them.)  This is a terrific film that can be enjoyed by thinking adults, and might particularly speak to men or women who have reached retirement age and are beginning to reevaluate their identity.",5,Lovely Character Study,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,1617,"['mature', 'years', 'are', 'so', 'often', 'neglected', 'film', 'butt', 'joke', 'Not', 'here', 'however', 'incomporable', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'character', 'intelligence', 'self-possession', 'seem', 'extension', 'Rowlands', 'making', 'very', 'good', 'fit', 'Seeing', 'woman', 'who', 'raised', 'children', 'now', 'searching', 'what', 'become', 'refreshing', 'storyline', 'Tomei', 'marvelous', 'support', 'white', 'trash', 'neighbor', 'really', 'appreciated', 'how', 'director', 'never', 'gave', 'easy', 'answers', 'characters', 'Tomei', 'never', 'lady', 'Rowlands', 'never', 'quite', 'out', 'where', 'going', 'merely', 'take', 'journey', 'character', 'Tomei', 'son', 'touching', 'poignancy', 'story', 'highlighting', 'Rowland', 'search', 'identity', 'late', 'stage', 'life', 'film', ""n't"", 'jump', 'up', 'tell', 'what', 'quietly', 'Rowland', 'life', 'lets', 'figure', 'out', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'thinking', 'viewers', 'would', 'like', 'other', 'films', 'first', 'viewing', 'seem', 'obtuse', 'answers', 'are', 'there', 'Unhook', 'Stars', 'viewer', 'time', 'look', 'performance', 'subtly', 'nuanced', 'theme', 'good', 'example', 'luncheon', 'scene', 'adult', 'son', 'wife', 'Watch', 'subtle', 'interplay', 'two', 'will', 'know', 'need', 'know', 'abou', 'relationship-and', 'why', 'Rowlands', 'not', 'live', 'terrific', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'thinking', 'adults', 'might', 'particularly', 'speak', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'reached', 'retirement', 'age', 'are', 'beginning', 'reevaluate', 'identity']",N/A
