1614463,A1ETMNKF9HO2TJ,B00AO05AN8,ahw,"[0, 0]","(Minor spoilers throughout.)For those unfamiliar with Rurouni Kenshin, it was originally a manga (comic) from the 90s that was adapted into an anime TV show while the comics were being written.  Production issues with the animated version caused some story differences between the show and the comic, resulting in the show being canceled before the comics were finished.  There were also some OVAs (the anime equivalent to straight-to-video movies) produced as well as a movie.  However, most fans treat the comic series as the definitive ""canonical"" version of Kenshin.The comics were roughly divided into three story arcs, and the New Kyoto Arc is a remake of this story line.  Contrary to what is suggested in one of the other reviews, this isn't simply a retelling of the same story from a different perspective.  Several key plot points were changed.For those of you familiar with Rurouni Kenshin, you may be bothered by these changes.  Some of the story changes are relatively superficial.  For example, in the original story, Misao meets Kenshin by happenstance and is unaware of his true identity for some time.  In this version, the story begins with Misao hunting down Kenshin because she knows that he met with Aoshi (albeit, she doesn't know the details of what happened).Some of the story changes from the original are puzzling because they detract from the suspense and drama in the original.  For example, in the original story, Misao meets and befriends Kenshin/Kaoru/Yahiko, but doesn't know about what happened to Aoshi and the rest of the Oniwabanshu.  Her lack of awareness in the original created drama and tension, as the viewer wondered what would happen when she found out.  In this version, she finds out fairly immediately, eliminating the drama and tension.  Another example of questionable plot changes involves the fight with Cho.  In the original, the fight was very well written with a climactic final blow that I won't describe in detail here.  Suffice to say, the encounter was rewritten in this version that saps all the drama from the original.The tone of New Kyoto Arc straddles a line somewhere between the comic/TV series on one hand and the OVAs on the other.  The OVAs turned a lot of fans off because the tone was very serious and violent, whereas the comic/TV series was more jovial and humorous.  While there is more humor retained in New Kyoto Arc compared to the OVAs, it doesn't try to emulate the humor from the comic/TV show.  I don't think Kenshin says ""Orooo"" at any point in New Kyoto Arc.  Also, there's an unintentionally funny sex scene involving Shisio and Yumi, which puts New Kyoto Arc squarely in the adult category, whereas the comic/TV show was more for kids/teens.The animation is an improvement from the original.  I didn't care much for some of the redesigns.  Kenshin looks slightly more disheveled and wild compared to his portrayal in the comics/TV show.  Hiko Seijuro looks older/uglier.  I also didn't care for the musical score, which is mostly a remix of the soundtrack from the TV show.If you are new to Rurouni Kenshin, New Kyoto Arc may be inaccessible/inscrutable because it strips away all the introductions and context from the original.  There isn't much explanation of Kenshin's backstory and there are no character introductions.  The first five minutes consists of a whirlwind review of how each key character gets to Kyoto without much explanation as to who they are or their backstories.In sum, I can't say this movie is worth purchasing.  I caught it on Hulu.  Might be worth watching if you are a fan that's curious to see what they are doing with the Kenshin IP these days, but otherwise stay away.",2,"Inferior to the Original, Puzzling Plot Changes, and May Be Inaccessible to Newcomers",1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,3683,"['Minor', 'spoilers', 'unfamiliar', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'was', 'originally', 'manga', 'comic', '90s', 'was', 'adapted', 'anime', 'TV', 'show', 'comics', 'were', 'being', 'written', 'Production', 'issues', 'animated', 'version', 'caused', 'story', 'differences', 'show', 'comic', 'resulting', 'show', 'being', 'canceled', 'comics', 'were', 'finished', 'were', 'also', 'OVAs', 'anime', 'equivalent', 'straight-to-video', 'movies', 'produced', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'However', 'most', 'fans', 'treat', 'comic', 'series', 'definitive', 'canonical', 'version', 'Kenshin.The', 'comics', 'were', 'roughly', 'divided', 'three', 'story', 'arcs', 'New', 'Kyoto', 'Arc', 'remake', 'story', 'line', 'Contrary', 'what', 'suggested', 'one', 'other', 'reviews', ""n't"", 'simply', 'retelling', 'same', 'story', 'different', 'perspective', 'Several', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'changed.For', 'familiar', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'may', 'be', 'bothered', 'changes', 'story', 'changes', 'are', 'relatively', 'superficial', 'example', 'original', 'story', 'Misao', 'meets', 'Kenshin', 'happenstance', 'unaware', 'true', 'identity', 'time', 'version', 'story', 'Misao', 'hunting', 'down', 'Kenshin', 'met', 'Aoshi', 'albeit', ""n't"", 'know', 'details', 'what', 'happened', '.Some', 'story', 'changes', 'original', 'are', 'puzzling', 'detract', 'suspense', 'drama', 'original', 'example', 'original', 'story', 'Misao', 'meets', 'befriends', 'Kenshin/Kaoru/Yahiko', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Aoshi', 'rest', 'Oniwabanshu', 'lack', 'awareness', 'original', 'created', 'drama', 'tension', 'viewer', 'wondered', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'version', 'out', 'fairly', 'immediately', 'eliminating', 'drama', 'tension', 'example', 'questionable', 'plot', 'changes', 'fight', 'Cho', 'original', 'fight', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'climactic', 'final', 'blow', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'detail', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'encounter', 'was', 'rewritten', 'version', 'drama', 'original.The', 'tone', 'New', 'Kyoto', 'Arc', 'line', 'somewhere', 'comic/TV', 'series', 'one', 'hand', 'OVAs', 'other', 'OVAs', 'turned', 'lot', 'fans', 'tone', 'was', 'very', 'serious', 'violent', 'comic/TV', 'series', 'was', 'more', 'jovial', 'humorous', 'more', 'humor', 'retained', 'New', 'Kyoto', 'Arc', 'compared', 'OVAs', ""n't"", 'try', 'emulate', 'humor', 'comic/TV', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Kenshin', 'Orooo', 'point', 'New', 'Kyoto', 'Arc', 'Also', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'sex', 'scene', 'involving', 'Shisio', 'Yumi', 'New', 'Kyoto', 'Arc', 'squarely', 'adult', 'category', 'comic/TV', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'kids/teens.The', 'animation', 'improvement', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'redesigns', 'Kenshin', 'slightly', 'more', 'disheveled', 'wild', 'compared', 'portrayal', 'comics/TV', 'show', 'Hiko', 'Seijuro', 'older/uglier', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'musical', 'score', 'mostly', 'remix', 'soundtrack', 'TV', 'show.If', 'are', 'new', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'New', 'Kyoto', 'Arc', 'may', 'be', 'inaccessible/inscrutable', 'away', 'introductions', 'context', 'original', ""n't"", 'much', 'explanation', 'Kenshin', 'backstory', 'are', 'character', 'introductions', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'whirlwind', 'review', 'how', 'key', 'character', 'Kyoto', 'much', 'explanation', 'who', 'are', 'backstories.In', 'sum', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'caught', 'Hulu', 'Might', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'fan', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Kenshin', 'IP', 'days', 'otherwise', 'stay', 'away']",N/A

1614465,A17ZQWVYCXHV4G,B00AO05AN8,Anime Fan,"[11, 12]","Okay, let me start off by saying that I am a purest when it comes to anime series and I grew up watching Rurouni Kenshin on Toonami and I own the Mangas and original DVD from Media Blaster. When I heard that they were creating a new OVA series after so many years, suffice to say I was excited, but that where it ends.The good:As far as the animation goes, this Blu-Ray is great because of the bright, vibrant colors and 1080P video. It looks awesome on my 42"" Plasma TVThe Bad:This is a hacked up, condensed version of the Kyoto Arc, which was magnificently animated during the original release many years ago. For purest like myself, this version is an insult to the original animation and story. This OVA lacks the comedy, action and storytelling from the original. In addition, because of the nature of the release, they squeezed the entire arc into 2 disc, roughly about 2 hours.Anyone who is a diehard fan or Rurouni Kenshin, I would say to pick this up as a used copy if you're interested in seeing this or wait til the price drops. But if you are expecting anything new or revolution because it's Blu-Ray or has new animation, you'll be very disappointed",3,"Hmmmm, not sure about this one",1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,1162,"['Okay', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'purest', 'when', 'anime', 'series', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'Toonami', 'own', 'Mangas', 'original', 'DVD', 'Media', 'Blaster', 'When', 'heard', 'were', 'creating', 'new', 'OVA', 'series', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'suffice', 'say', 'was', 'excited', 'where', 'ends.The', 'good', 'As', 'far', 'animation', 'Blu-Ray', 'great', 'bright', 'vibrant', 'colors', '1080P', 'video', 'awesome', '42', 'Plasma', 'TVThe', 'Bad', 'hacked', 'up', 'condensed', 'version', 'Kyoto', 'Arc', 'was', 'magnificently', 'animated', 'original', 'release', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'purest', 'version', 'insult', 'original', 'animation', 'story', 'OVA', 'comedy', 'action', 'storytelling', 'original', 'addition', 'nature', 'release', 'squeezed', 'entire', 'arc', '2', 'disc', 'roughly', '2', 'hours.Anyone', 'who', 'diehard', 'fan', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'would', 'say', 'pick', 'up', 'used', 'copy', ""'re"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'wait', 'price', 'drops', 'are', 'expecting', 'anything', 'new', 'revolution', 'Blu-Ray', 'new', 'animation', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'disappointed']",N/A

I was persuaded to do so and regret it.All I can say is, what a waste. And where do I begin? Well, the animation looks extremely cheap, (sometimes it seems that Aoshi and Soujiro have the same hair) they mess with the plot big time (for instance Shishio kills Usui - which really made me mad because the Saitou-Usui fight was one of my favorites in the series), Soujiro has no major breakdown, fights and locations are changed or don't happen at all, etc.Did we really need to see Shishio and Yumi doing it? No.One big thing...Spoiler alert...Kenshin kills Shishio. Yeah. Kind of a major character error there. I mean, wasn't the whole point of the series that Kenshin refused to kill again? But instead he cracks Shishio's head open with the hilt of his sword.And of course - I'm not the first person to say this - why not just animate the Jinchuu arc rather than redo the Kyoto Arc?!

1614468,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00AO05AN8,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 6]","In the 1990&#8242;s, the manga and anime series ""Rurouni Kenshin"" by Nobuhiro Watsuki, was one of the first major anime series to attract fans outside of Japan because it was aired on the Cartoon Network's Toonami block but in Japan, it was published in Shueisha's ""Weekly Shonen Jump"".The series would lead to two OVA's, two animated films and most recently a live-action film plus video games, light novels and more.And while the series ended back in 1999, in 2012, the manga series of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" had sold over 55 million copies and the anime has ranked among the 100 most watched series in Japan.And to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of ""Rurouni Kenshin"", a new manga series titled ""Rurouni Kenshin Restoration"" is being published in ""Weekly Shonen Jump"" and two new animated films were created in Japan based on the Kyoto Arc, with part one debuting in theaters in 2011 and part two in 2012.  And now, these two 45-minute films will be released in the U.S. as a 2-part OVA on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.VIDEO:""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  Unlike the original series made in the '90s or the films and OVA's that were made in the early 2000&#8242;s, the ""New Kyoto Arc"" features new animation by Studio DEEN.  Featuring all new animation, beautifully painted backgrounds and animation that is much more vibrant, sharper and better line-detail, I would imagine that fans should be happy with the HD presentation of the film.  I didn't see any banding issues, artifacts or any problematic issues with picture quality.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It's important for people to know that the English dub does not feature the '90s Bang Zoom cast but does feature the ADV cast used for the original OVA and animated film release.  Personally, I feel that the English dub is subjective but in my opinion, the voice acting felt a bit off with a few characters, so I decided to watch both OVA's in its original Japanese dialogue with English subtitles.  For one, you get the same voice actors from the original television series and I felt that the dynamic range was slightly better than its English dub counterpart.But both soundtracks are crystal clear, as with its musical soundtrack.  I didn't notice the surround channels being used or any LFE.  If anything, it was a front/center channel mix.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" did not come with any special features.JUDGMENT CALL:I was very thrilled to know that with the 15th anniversary of ""Rurouni Kenshi"", we would get a brand new release of the Kyoto Arc of ""Rurouni Kenshin"".For those who have watched animated films and are used to the abridged version of the stories, while it would have been nice to have three films (OVA's) instead of two, to include more storyline and feature more of the characters, for the most part, these two OVA's are easily accessible for those without any prior knowledge of the manga and anime series.But by saying that, I know there are people who despise abridged storylines and would rather see a full TV series or multiple OVA's or movies to mirror the manga series.  So, if you are one of those people, you're probably going to complain about this release.Otherwise, if you are used to seeing abridged films or OVA's but wanting to see ""Rurouni Kenshin"" in HD, then you can look at these two OVA's as a bonus to celebrate ""Rurouni Kenshin"" being released on Blu-ray.For one, Studio DEEN did a magnificent job with the animation and art backgrounds.  The return of Mayo Suzukaze as Kenshin Himura is fantastic, also seeing the original Japanese cast return 15-years later is a major treat.  It was great to have Noriko Hidaka reprise her role as Sojiro Seta (a few years ago, she also reprised her role for the ""Gunbuster"" animated film release).  But you have Tomo Sakurai returning as Misao, Miina Tominaga as Yahiko, Ken Narita as Hajime Saitou and more.  So, it's a great reunion after all these years to bring back the Japanese voice actors.And I hope that with the release of the two OVA's, it may lead people to watching the older releases or even purchasing the manga. But once again, those who never watched or read ""Rurouni Kenshin"" should be fine watching ""Rurouni Kenshin: New Kyoto Arc"" as they were released as films and directors know that chances of new viewers is quite high and try to make these storyline's, not too complex for them.Sure, it helps to know the background of the characters and the storyline leading to the New Kyoto Arc but it's a pretty self explanatory storyline and the writers made it simple enough for those who have no intention of reading the manga series or watching the older anime.But while the reunion of the voice talent and animation quality was a plus, I have to admit that its main hindrance lies in the fact that the storyline was too condensed.  Major battles were too quick for my taste and you miss out on storyline relating to the characters.  But I suppose one can easily watch the anime TV series or read the manga, but I felt that perhaps a third OVA could have made things much better, especially in the fighting sequences.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality for both OVA's are very good and audio quality is in lossless, crystal clear dialogue but not too active when it comes to surround sound use or LFE.  And unfortunately, there are no special features which is a surprise, considering it would have been great to interview the director or even the original Japanese voice acting talent about reuniting nearly 15-years later.  Also, with this New Kyoto Arc, you get a rating of TV MA V because of the violence but also a sex scene (no nudity) featuring Nishio and Yumi.Overall, ""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" was a pretty cool way to celebrate its 15th year anniversary.  I found the two OVA's to be entertaining and I enjoyed them for the fact that it reunited the Japanese cast, features all new animation and its presented in HD.  It's caveat is due to the fact a large part of that storyline has been eliminated in order to fit the entire arc in two 45-minute OVA's, which may not please the more hardcore fans.  But for those who have no intention of watching the older series or even reading all the manga, may be fine with this Blu-ray release.Until the original series is released on Blu-ray, ""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" is worth checking out!",4,"(3.5 Stars) ""Rurouni Kenshi: New Kyoto Arc"" was a pretty cool way to celebrate its 15th year anniversary.

The art style was bright and colorful, and the English dubbing was very good.  After watching &#34;Reflection&#34;, anything is good, ha ha.  Yes, the story of Shishio was changed from the manga and the anime series, and left out a lot of the &#34;real&#34; storyline.  But it was still watchable, and at least it was something new to watch for Rurouni Kenshin fans.  I'll give it four stars because I liked the English dubbing.  I would rather have had the Jinchu Arc animated, but there is hope that this film will lead the way for that.",4,"Come on, it wasn't that bad.",1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,638,"['dvd', 'set', 'had', 'parts', 'New', 'Kyoto', 'Arc', 'one', 'package', 'was', 'convenient', 'saved', 'money', 'art', 'style', 'was', 'bright', 'colorful', 'English', 'dubbing', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'watching', '34', 'Reflection', '34', 'anything', 'good', 'ha', 'ha', 'Yes', 'story', 'Shishio', 'was', 'changed', 'manga', 'anime', 'series', 'left', 'out', 'lot', '34', 'real', '34', 'storyline', 'was', 'still', 'watchable', 'least', 'was', 'something', 'new', 'watch', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'liked', 'English', 'dubbing', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'had', 'Jinchu', 'Arc', 'animated', 'hope', 'film', 'will', 'lead', 'way']",N/A

I wish I would've waited until the price came down. It is not worth paying top dollar.I feel it is extremely important to realize that this Rurouni Kenshin DVD is a knock off of the entire series. In my opinion and I am a huge Kenshin fan this compilation is not worth the time watching.However, I did not listen to the Japanese voice actors. It maybe a totally different experience. I felt these OVAs were a terrible telling of Rurouni Kenshin the series.
