This is what I'd call an &#34;action/comedy&#34; film as there is quite a bit of action scenes with comedy spread here and there. Rick Jarmin is a man who has had several identities while in the Witness Protection Program after testifying against a drug-dealing FBI agent named Eugene Sorenson (David Carradine). Marianne, old flame of Rick's, by chance runs into him at a gas station. She knows it's him, but he does his best to convince her he's someone else. After serving his sentence, Sorenson and his partner Albert Diggs (Bill Duke) set out to find and kill Jarmin so they can be in the good graces of a Columbian drug dealer. Typical of many 1980s/1990s films, there is a crooked man in the FBI who is feeding Sorenson and Diggs information. The movie proceeds from one of Jarmin's past identities to the next. Plenty of action and an occasional comedic situations ensues.This is one of Mel Gibson's lesser known films yet it is one of my favorites. Mel and Goldie have great chemistry together and portray their characters convincingly, which not all 80s/90s film can say of its stars.

Not on the same level as PB, but okay. This is one of Mel's earlier movies. The chemistry between the two actors seemed a bit forced at times. I don't think they really liked each other all that much in real life. Tough job. ""I love you!"" (Really I don't like you much but kiss me anyway)..This story is, start in the middle, go both ways. It's funny at times and you get to see Mel and Goldie in their heyday! He's a guy that's deeply hidden in a witness relocation program. There are some very bad dudes looking for him. And he thinks he's finally found a spot where he can settle. After years of hopping around, he finally settles for being a mechanic in some rural garage. He and the owners are friends. I think the owner knows that Mel's talents far exceeds where he wants to be ...But hey, the owner is getting old and needs a partner. Don't look a gift...er..Mel in the mouth, right? All seems nice and calm...And then Goldie stops for gas. They were an item before he disappears. Goldie wants to know why he left when they were so close. Mel panics. Calls his bugg-out squad, and causes enough commotion that a corrupt FBI agent, (a plant especially put there to find Mel in the Witness Relocation) finds Mel and tells his old buddies that are looking for him where he is. And the race is on. Goldie and Mel run for their lives as the Hit Men get on their trail. Fast paced action. Lots of fun to watch them run as they hash out their abrupt separation! I especially like how Goldie plays the ultimate pampered rich chick that gets into these situations where she becomes Sigourney Weaver but complaining about her manicure the whole time! Nobody does it better.Would I watch it again? Apparently I did.Was it worth the watch? If your just watching all off a certain Stars movies, kind of a video-biography,  yes.Would I have gone to the box office? Nah....I'd waited on the video",4,I love the old Goldie stuff.
