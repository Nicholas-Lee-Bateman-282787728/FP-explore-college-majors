So I decided to start collecting the series and start from the beginning.  Just finished watching the first episode which was also the pilot episode.  It was great to finally see how things got started !  One of the discs was loose in the case but I watched it and not only played well but the pictures is extremely clear (better the many of my other dvd's), sound is great.  I think it is going to be great watching the team grow together since I had not seen any of these early episodes before.  Seriously enjoyed the story lines.  I have already purchased series 2 and 3 and will review them as soon as they have been watched. But I can say I will be ordering the rest of the series, especially since I am so very pleased with the disc quality.",5,"Such great enjoyment, great picture quality too !",1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,832,"['PBS', 'channels', 'keep', 'running', 'same', 'two', 'years', 'New', 'Tricks', 'over', 'again', 'decided', 'start', 'collecting', 'series', 'start', 'beginning', 'Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'also', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'finally', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'got', 'started', 'One', 'discs', 'was', 'loose', 'case', 'watched', 'not', 'only', 'played', 'well', 'pictures', 'extremely', 'clear', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'dvd', 'sound', 'great', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'watching', 'team', 'grow', 'together', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'early', 'episodes', 'Seriously', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'lines', 'have', 'already', 'purchased', 'series', '2', '3', 'will', 'review', 'as', 'soon', 'have', 'been', 'watched', 'can', 'say', 'will', 'be', 'ordering', 'rest', 'series', 'especially', 'am', 'so', 'very', 'pleased', 'disc', 'quality']",N/A

Only in the UK would the basis of a show be about three retired detectives who come back to work for a driven babe suddenly demoted to head up the cold case squad. Three superb UK character actors play the senior detectives. The show is just as much about the comedy and drama of their own lives as it is about cold cases.  One detective is a three time divorcee yet ironically he is the big family man.  It is hilarious to see him having dinner either in or out with all three ex wives, his three daughters and his grandson.  His scenes with this entourage are priceless. Then there is the one who is OCD and has to take psychiatric medicine for same. His disability makes him a treasure trove of info about everything pertaining to police investigations.  There is no info too obscure for him. These two are rounded out by the third, the most respectable and distinguished of the three retirees.  However, he cannot recover from the loss of his wife to a hit and run driver when she was only 51.  So he talks to her shrine in the back yard and visits clairvoyants. And he was a detective chief inspector.  The babe is in charge of these three and keeping them under any semblance of control is the best she can achieve.  They run rings around her at every chance.

1255247,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,B00287Z19I,Doctor Trance,"[55, 59]","UCOS - The Unsolved Crime and Open Case Squad is a rag tag, elder bunch of ex-cops who are assembled by the recently demoted DS Pullman, played by Amanda Redman.  She had a bust go bad where she accidentally shot a dog, and suddenly she finds herself leading this team of cops whose best years are far behind them.  All of her 3 re-hires left the police for various reasons and each has their own share of personal and emotional issues they are dealing with.  For Pullman, she is constantly trying to balance her career and finding the time to continually hit the dating scene in her 40's.  Handling the stubborn and erratic personalities of her new team is another challenge.Jack Halford (played by James Bolam) is the only member who left the police force on amicable terms, having retired as a D.C. Superintendent.  He is forever haunted by the hit and run accident that claimed his wife.  He seems to be the oldest, but also the clearest thinker of the squad.Brian Lane (played by Alun Armstrong) is an ex Detective Inspector who was sacked for having someone die while in his custody, which he strongly felt was not his fault.  He's sort of a pill popping, memory machine with OCD who memorized everyone's resume who has ever worked at Scotland Yard.  Also, if you ask him what he was doing on July 19th, 1978, he'll remember.My favorite of the bunch, and what drew me to find this show in the first place is the star of numerous popular UK shows over the years, including the highly popular Sweeney and Minder series, Dennis Waterman.  It seems he always plays a ladies' man in every series, and this one is no exception.  You will usually find him hitting on his boss, being pursued by ex-flames, or eyeing the multitude of women he encounters during his cases.Waterman's character Gerry Standing, although no longer performing his legendary fisticuffs as he did in Minder and Sweeney, still manages to pull some punches with his sharp tongue and wit.  He was fired for breaking his superior's jaw, a Commisioner Bevan, who just so happens to be UCOS's supervisor, so you can imagine the interaction just waiting to happen there.  A classic Waterman highlight is when the crew is reviewing film of a late 60's protest for a case and he jumps up, all serious-like and says, ""ey, wait"".  Then pauses the video only to point at a girl in the crowd and say, ""I had her"".After a rather long 90 minute pilot, once you get into normal episodes, they are strong from start to finish.  Unlike US TV shows, where going back and viewing the first 5 or 6 shows can sometimes look awkward; and actors don't really find their niche in their character, sometimes up until the 2nd season; this superb gang of British vets really nail their characters right out of the gate.  I felt the pilot was merely a preview of what was to come, and it certainly doesn't play like the rest of the episodes do in the series (they are much better).  I was almost ready to write the series off after the pilot, but I'm glad I didn't.One other fine character is PC Clark, played by Chike Okonkwo.  In this first series, he is the low on the totem pole, young police constable, who really offsets all the older characters.  He was always eager to help out and offer his young viewpoint and detective skills to the team.  I feel this will be a slight negative not seeing him reappear in later shows, as his character does not return for series 2.  A minor setback to an otherwise strong and entertaining British show.While following that TV crime solving mold, it still manages to have that certain appeal that US shows simply do not have.  It's also great to see one of my favorite actors, Dennis Waterman, still holding his own after 4 decades.  He also sings the show's theme song (a staple for shows he's starred in over the years) and a cover of the Traveling Wilbury's End Of The Line in one of the episodes.It's surprising to see this as a US DVD release, because as far as I know, this only appeared on some PBS channels in certain parts of the country, and I haven't seen it on any cable channels (maybe BBC America at one time?).  I think it's high ratings in it's later seasons in the UK have warranted a US ""trial"".  I say trial as in they release a first season, and only subsequent sets come out if sales are good.  However, even The Sweeney hasn't had a series 2 release in the US yet, so I presume there's a slim chance of all 5 later series of New Tricks getting released here, but you never know.  I'll just have to continue ordering the Region 2 series sets.  Series 6 aired in July in the UK with a DVD release scheduled for Sept.

1255251,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00287Z19I,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[6, 6]","Police procedurals have been around as long as there's been television sets.  In most cases, these shows will have a modest-sized cast with supporting players all revolving around a lead or pair of leads who have some unusual relationship, habit, or method for approaching their work.  Take Sherlock Holmes, for example: Holmes is the ubermensch who sees and knows all, and Watson is a trusty sidekick.  Take CSI, as another example: a team of scientists - each with his own specialty - come together to use their skills for examining `the evidence' in order to catch a culprit.  Heck, even in the world of NYPD BLUE each detective recognized that there was something inimitable about the way Andy Sipowicz could use his tough-guy-personae to squeak a confession out of even the most unforgiving criminal without raising a finger.Enter the BBC's NEW TRICKS ...Detective Superintendant Sandra Pullman (played by Amanda Redman) hits a rough spot in her career when a routine kidnapping investigation results in a rescued but seriously injured captive and a dead dog (which actually ends up being one of the best running gags of the first season).  She's demoted to head up UCOS, an unsolved crimes department of the police force; however, she's given no staff.  Ever resourceful, she recruits a squad of former detectives to pull off of retirement and serve as her team: Jack Halford (James Bolan) is the crusty veteran who can play word games with any suspect; Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman) is the former `loose cannon' who's been chastised for striking a superior officer; and Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong) is that possible-screw-loose detective who sees conspiracies everywhere he looks.  Each of them has experienced career stagnation over bending the rules in their past, and, now together, they're destined to bring back the old ways of solving crimes in the age when blood and fibers have become so commonplace.So far as police procedurals are concerned, I haven't come across an ensemble that I've enjoyed this much in quite some time.  Each detective has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, and, as a unit, they tend to complement one another when the circumstances require it.  If anything, the scripts they're given have a bit too much reliance on the science of solving crimes (most of these crimes took place just before forensics took a larger role in police stations); on too many occasions, the much-praised DNA points them in new directions.  The show's strength is these detectives' collective willingness to embrace irregular methods to catch the culprit, especially when it means bending a few procedures.  When the stories match that dynamic, the episodes feel effortless.NEW TRICKS (SEASON 01) was produced by the BBC and Wall to Wall Television.  This first season consists of a two-hour pilot and six (approx.) one hour episodes.  While the video transfer is not perfect (there's a fair amount of grain in what I watched), the audio is definitely solid.  There's even an English subtitling track for those us (me especially) who occasionally struggle with various European accents.  Sadly, there are no special features or bloopers, and I'd imagine a cast this funny would produce some marvelous missteps.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  NEW TRICKS maintains a `nice' level of consistency, though I'll admit struggling a bit with a few of the stories with a bit of a harder edge.  The first few episodes are, largely, softer and more humorous with perhaps more relatable yarns, while the last few push the envelope a bit in terms of grittier cases.  What's consistent, though, is the way these unconventional detectives use their skills and experience to resolve these open or unsolved cases.  At all times, NEW TRICKS remains its character-centric focus, and the ensemble is winning.  Between the four older principles and their younger African-American departmental aide, there's enough character to keep anyone's interest even when their cases grow a bit cumbersome.",4,No Sense Teaching These Old Dogs Any NEW TRICKS,1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,3985,"['Police', 'procedurals', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'long', 'been', 'television', 'sets', 'most', 'cases', 'shows', 'will', 'have', 'modest-sized', 'cast', 'supporting', 'players', 'revolving', 'around', 'lead', 'pair', 'leads', 'who', 'have', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'habit', 'method', 'approaching', 'work', 'Take', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'example', 'Holmes', 'ubermensch', 'who', 'Watson', 'trusty', 'sidekick', 'Take', 'CSI', 'example', 'team', 'scientists', 'own', 'specialty', 'come', 'together', 'use', 'skills', 'examining', 'evidence', 'order', 'catch', 'culprit', 'Heck', 'even', 'world', 'NYPD', 'BLUE', 'detective', 'recognized', 'was', 'something', 'inimitable', 'way', 'Andy', 'Sipowicz', 'could', 'use', 'tough-guy-personae', 'squeak', 'confession', 'even', 'most', 'unforgiving', 'criminal', 'raising', 'finger.Enter', 'BBC', 'NEW', 'TRICKS', 'Detective', 'Superintendant', 'Sandra', 'Pullman', 'played', 'Amanda', 'Redman', 'rough', 'spot', 'career', 'when', 'routine', 'kidnapping', 'investigation', 'results', 'rescued', 'seriously', 'injured', 'captive', 'dead', 'dog', 'actually', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'running', 'gags', 'first', 'season', 'demoted', 'head', 'up', 'UCOS', 'unsolved', 'crimes', 'department', 'police', 'force', 'however', 'given', 'staff', 'Ever', 'resourceful', 'squad', 'former', 'detectives', 'pull', 'off', 'retirement', 'serve', 'team', 'Jack', 'Halford', 'James', 'Bolan', 'crusty', 'veteran', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'word', 'games', 'suspect', 'Gerry', 'Standing', 'Dennis', 'Waterman', 'former', 'loose', 'cannon', 'who', 'been', 'chastised', 'striking', 'superior', 'officer', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'possible-screw-loose', 'detective', 'who', 'conspiracies', 'everywhere', 'experienced', 'career', 'stagnation', 'bending', 'rules', 'past', 'now', 'together', ""'re"", 'destined', 'bring', 'back', 'old', 'ways', 'solving', 'crimes', 'age', 'when', 'blood', 'fibers', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'commonplace.So', 'far', 'police', 'procedurals', 'are', 'concerned', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'ensemble', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'much', 'quite', 'time', 'detective', 'own', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'unit', 'tend', 'complement', 'one', 'when', 'circumstances', 'require', 'anything', 'scripts', ""'re"", 'given', 'have', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'reliance', 'science', 'solving', 'crimes', 'most', 'crimes', 'took', 'place', 'just', 'forensics', 'took', 'larger', 'role', 'police', 'stations', 'too', 'many', 'occasions', 'much-praised', 'DNA', 'points', 'new', 'directions', 'show', 'strength', 'detectives', 'collective', 'willingness', 'embrace', 'irregular', 'methods', 'catch', 'culprit', 'especially', 'when', 'bending', 'few', 'procedures', 'When', 'stories', 'match', 'dynamic', 'episodes', 'feel', 'effortless.NEW', 'TRICKS', 'SEASON', '01', 'was', 'produced', 'BBC', 'Wall', 'Wall', 'Television', 'first', 'season', 'two-hour', 'pilot', 'six', 'approx', 'one', 'hour', 'episodes', 'video', 'transfer', 'not', 'perfect', 'fair', 'amount', 'grain', 'what', 'watched', 'audio', 'definitely', 'solid', 'even', 'English', 'subtitling', 'track', 'especially', 'who', 'occasionally', 'struggle', 'various', 'European', 'accents', 'Sadly', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'bloopers', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'cast', 'funny', 'would', 'produce', 'marvelous', 'missteps.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NEW', 'TRICKS', 'nice', 'level', 'consistency', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'struggling', 'bit', 'few', 'stories', 'bit', 'harder', 'edge', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'largely', 'softer', 'more', 'humorous', 'perhaps', 'more', 'relatable', 'yarns', 'last', 'few', 'push', 'envelope', 'bit', 'terms', 'grittier', 'cases', 'What', 'consistent', 'though', 'way', 'unconventional', 'detectives', 'use', 'skills', 'experience', 'resolve', 'open', 'unsolved', 'cases', 'times', 'NEW', 'TRICKS', 'character-centric', 'focus', 'ensemble', 'winning', 'four', 'older', 'principles', 'younger', 'African-American', 'departmental', 'aide', 'enough', 'character', 'keep', 'anyone', 'interest', 'even', 'when', 'cases', 'grow', 'bit', 'cumbersome']",N/A

Few cop dramas have real humor in them without being some kind of parody. This is not that at all, it is true to life and lets face it there's humor in real life too. Especially when it's older retired cops who are driven to solve crimes and have to face todays world of policing.  I honestly laughed more than once during this show and never felt it wasn't a situation that didn't seem reasonable.  As far as cop shows go this one is right up there in the top for me.  It's not a action show but a drama and murder mystery show done with heart.  It's always interesting  to see older generations work with younger ones and in police work that's going to be even more interesting.  So get yourself a new trick and get into this series.

1255292,A3H4EV4UMST3HV,B00287Z19I,steve b,"[120, 121]","New Tricks is the best British cop show since the legendry 'Sweeney'. Like that great show what New Tricks has, but most British Cop shows lack is humour. This is not to say that is it is either a comedy or a 'light' detective series in the manner of say Pie in the Sky. The crimes in New Tricks are real, violent often messy.The concept is not new, three retired detectives are called back to look at unsolved cases. The premise being that as old coppers they will be aware of the police procedures at the time when the crimes were carried out. The first Jack Halford (James Bolam)was the most senior and the most level headed even though he spends most evenings talking to his dead wife who is buried in his back garden. Jack has a violent and brutal side which from time to time slips out. He does however appear to have the respect of everyone who knew him as a serving police officer.The second is Gerry Standing ( Dennis Waterman). We get the impression that Jerry was not above taking the odd bribe from criminals but as he tells his boss 'Sandra I'm a bad boy not a bastard'. He has a number of ex wives and host of children all of whom are girls. Collectively he calls them 'The Covern.' Of the three he is the one who refuses to grow old. An early scene has the three compairing medication. The other two have pills for blood pressure, heart, depression etc. Gerry has viagra. He also struggles with the modern no smoking rules.The third, Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong). Brain suffers from mental health problems and is a recovering alcoholic. He also has an encyclopedic knowledge of criminal cases and various police officers hence his knickname og 'Memory Lane'. Alone of the three he has a wife (Susan Jameson) who struggles to cope with his bizzare behavour.The three are managed by Sandra Pullman (Amanda Redmond)who is the only serving police officer in the team. She is torn between defending her team from those higher up and frustration at the old school antics of the three, such as secretly taping suspects, this is defended by Gerry who points out he is no longer a copper and only the police are bared from secretly tapping suspects.Each of the five is perfectly played. Class drama, well written undemanding but does not treat you as an idiot.",5,The best British police series for many a year.,1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,2265,"['New', 'Tricks', 'best', 'British', 'cop', 'show', 'legendry', ""'Sweeney"", 'great', 'show', 'what', 'New', 'Tricks', 'most', 'British', 'Cop', 'shows', 'lack', 'humour', 'not', 'say', 'comedy', ""'light"", 'detective', 'series', 'manner', 'say', 'Pie', 'Sky', 'crimes', 'New', 'Tricks', 'are', 'real', 'violent', 'often', 'messy.The', 'concept', 'not', 'new', 'three', 'retired', 'detectives', 'are', 'called', 'back', 'look', 'unsolved', 'cases', 'premise', 'being', 'old', 'coppers', 'will', 'be', 'aware', 'police', 'procedures', 'time', 'when', 'crimes', 'were', 'carried', 'out', 'first', 'Jack', 'Halford', 'James', 'Bolam', 'was', 'most', 'senior', 'most', 'level', 'headed', 'even', 'most', 'evenings', 'talking', 'dead', 'wife', 'who', 'buried', 'back', 'garden', 'Jack', 'violent', 'brutal', 'side', 'time', 'time', 'slips', 'out', 'however', 'appear', 'have', 'respect', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'serving', 'police', 'officer.The', 'second', 'Gerry', 'Standing', 'Dennis', 'Waterman', 'get', 'impression', 'Jerry', 'was', 'not', 'taking', 'odd', 'bribe', 'criminals', 'boss', ""'m"", 'bad', 'boy', 'not', 'bastard', 'number', 'ex', 'wives', 'host', 'children', 'whom', 'are', 'girls', 'Collectively', 'Covern', 'three', 'one', 'who', 'grow', 'old', 'early', 'scene', 'three', 'compairing', 'medication', 'other', 'two', 'have', 'pills', 'blood', 'pressure', 'heart', 'depression', 'etc', 'Gerry', 'viagra', 'also', 'modern', 'smoking', 'rules.The', 'third', 'Brian', 'Lane', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'Brain', 'suffers', 'mental', 'health', 'problems', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'also', 'encyclopedic', 'knowledge', 'criminal', 'cases', 'various', 'police', 'officers', 'hence', 'knickname', 'og', ""'Memory"", 'Lane', 'Alone', 'three', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Jameson', 'who', 'cope', 'bizzare', 'behavour.The', 'three', 'are', 'managed', 'Sandra', 'Pullman', 'Amanda', 'Redmond', 'who', 'only', 'serving', 'police', 'officer', 'team', 'torn', 'defending', 'team', 'higher', 'up', 'frustration', 'old', 'school', 'antics', 'three', 'such', 'secretly', 'taping', 'suspects', 'defended', 'Gerry', 'who', 'out', 'no', 'longer', 'copper', 'only', 'police', 'are', 'bared', 'secretly', 'tapping', 'suspects.Each', 'five', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Class', 'drama', 'well', 'written', 'undemanding', 'not', 'treat', 'idiot']",N/A

Anyway, I love British shows, not all, but most of them. This is one series that I came to love during the course of viewing it. The premise is priceless and the stories are great. Female Superintendent (You go, girl!) leads the Unsolved Crimes unit made up of three retired male detectives from before her time. The first episode started out with a bang, then slowed a bit and then moved into action. Her downfall began with shooting a dog that attacked her during the raid of a cockerel fight and is the running gag during the series.Overall, I've come to love this show. It's great fun and interesting crime drama as well. The four different characters have a great rapport. I highly recommend it if you're a fan of British TV. Overall, well done.",5,Great fun!

I was amazed to find it's no longer offered on Amazon.com except as a ""market place"" item for the better part of $200.  Went to the British Amazon (www.amazon.co.uk) and got it for $16.06 though, of course, it's a Region 2 DVD and won't play on most American (Region 1) players.  It will, however, play on many computers.Just to be sure my friend would have no problems with it, I also got her an inexpensive Region Free player for Christmas. These range in price from $50 to $80.  Now, if she wants further episodes, she can get the Region 2's at the British Amazon where they're cheaper than their American counterparts.  In addition she'll have access to a whole new variety of costume dramas, comedies, mysteries, sci-fi, etc. that's generally better written, better acted and more engaging than what's on American TV.For any who may be interested but are anxious about currency conversion -- when you go through the ""checkout"", you can easily select to have your purchase displayed in US Dollars.Update December 16, 2011:Series 1-8 are now available at Amazon Uk.
