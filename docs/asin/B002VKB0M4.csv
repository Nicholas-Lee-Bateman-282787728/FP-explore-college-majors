1293478,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B002VKB0M4,Andy Orrock,"[3, 4]","Writer/Director C&eacute;dric Klapisch and lead actor Romain Duris were magic together in the sleeper hitL'Auberge Espagnole (The Spanish Apartment)and its lesser known follow-upRussian Dolls.  Duris is a favorite of mine of long-standing based on the work of those two films and, more notably, his turn in the outstanding Jacques Audiard thrillerThe Beat That My Heart Skipped.  So, 'Paris' seemed like a custom-made movie made specifically for my viewing interests.  And, it delivered.  All that and Juliette Binoche, too.  What's not to love?Klapisch's script interweaves two main story lines and some smaller Parisian vignettes.  It's the Duris/Binoche tale that is the clear winner.  The movie percolates whenever the two of them (portraying brother and sister) are on-screen, either together or in their own storylines.  The second major narrative thread - involving Fabrice Luchini's character's midlife crises and panic attacks - is, at best, less compelling and, at worst, slightly creepy.  Luchini's late-50s history professor hits on his early-20s student (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) via a series of increasingly inappropriate text messages.  Kalpisch makes a misstep here: right at the point that Laurent's Laetitia is convinced she has a stalker, Luchini's Roland is clumsily forced to reveal his hand.  The upshot is an unexpected, offputting consummation of the 'relationship.'  That doesn't feel credible at all.By comparison, the Duris/Binoche tale is fantastic.  The heart of the story is Duris's character's heart.  In short, it's failing.  Time is running short.  Binoche and her young, adorable children move in to help while he hopes a donor comes through.  You'll find yourself counting down the moments for Klapisch to return to their story.  I was especially taken by the scenes of Duris's character (Pierre) watching movies of his earlier self as a Moulin Rouge dancer.  Klapisch and his filmmakers have gone the extra step of making those reels look like older, grainy, amateur footage.  It's a wonderful effect.  Later, Duris and Binoche host a party.  Pierre's ex-fellow dancers attend and we see them in the living room doing the dance steps we saw on the earlier tape.  Little details like this are redolent of the Klapisch touch.",5,"Five stars for the Duris/Binoche storyline; during the rest of 'Paris,' I waited patiently for Klapisch to go back to those two",1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,2258,"['Writer/Director', 'C', 'eacute', 'dric', 'Klapisch', 'lead', 'actor', 'Romain', 'Duris', 'were', 'magic', 'together', 'sleeper', ""hitL'Auberge"", 'Espagnole', 'Spanish', 'Apartment', 'lesser', 'known', 'follow-upRussian', 'Dolls', 'Duris', 'favorite', 'mine', 'long-standing', 'based', 'work', 'two', 'films', 'more', 'notably', 'turn', 'outstanding', 'Jacques', 'Audiard', 'Beat', 'My', 'Heart', 'Skipped', 'So', 'seemed', 'custom-made', 'movie', 'made', 'specifically', 'viewing', 'interests', 'delivered', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'too', 'What', 'not', 'love', 'Klapisch', 'script', 'two', 'main', 'story', 'lines', 'smaller', 'Parisian', 'vignettes', 'Duris/Binoche', 'tale', 'clear', 'winner', 'movie', 'two', 'portraying', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'on-screen', 'either', 'together', 'own', 'storylines', 'second', 'major', 'narrative', 'thread', 'involving', 'Fabrice', 'Luchini', 'character', 'midlife', 'crises', 'panic', 'attacks', 'best', 'less', 'compelling', 'worst', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'Luchini', 'late-50s', 'history', 'professor', 'hits', 'early-20s', 'student', 'M', 'eacute', 'Laurent', 'series', 'increasingly', 'inappropriate', 'text', 'messages', 'Kalpisch', 'misstep', 'here', 'right', 'point', 'Laurent', 'Laetitia', 'convinced', 'stalker', 'Luchini', 'Roland', 'clumsily', 'forced', 'reveal', 'hand', 'upshot', 'unexpected', 'offputting', 'consummation', ""'relationship"", ""n't"", 'feel', 'credible', 'all.By', 'comparison', 'Duris/Binoche', 'tale', 'fantastic', 'heart', 'story', 'Duris', 'character', 'heart', 'short', 'failing', 'Time', 'running', 'short', 'Binoche', 'young', 'adorable', 'children', 'move', 'help', 'donor', 'through', ""'ll"", 'find', 'counting', 'down', 'moments', 'Klapisch', 'return', 'story', 'was', 'especially', 'taken', 'scenes', 'Duris', 'character', 'Pierre', 'watching', 'movies', 'earlier', 'self', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'dancer', 'Klapisch', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'gone', 'extra', 'step', 'making', 'reels', 'look', 'older', 'grainy', 'amateur', 'footage', 'wonderful', 'effect', 'Later', 'Duris', 'Binoche', 'host', 'party', 'Pierre', 'ex-fellow', 'dancers', 'attend', 'see', 'living', 'room', 'doing', 'dance', 'saw', 'earlier', 'tape', 'Little', 'details', 'are', 'redolent', 'Klapisch', 'touch']",N/A

You will find yourself in here, touched upon in several ways. Life's tragedies: falling in love, losing love; appreciating life and losing it in death!

1293487,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002VKB0M4,Grady Harp,"[33, 37]","PARIS is a kaleidoscopic view of that great City of Light inhabited with a variety of individuals each of whom is consumed with life and love and living and dying. C&eacute;dric Klapisch has written and directed this richly populated canvas as a background of a tender story of a Moulin Rouge male dancer Pierre (Romain Duris) who is diagnosed with a terminal heart disease requiring transplantation if he is to survive. But in the end the many characters introduced in 'incidental stories' have become so interesting that, instead of providing simply a background for Pierre's portrait, they become an integral part of the drama as well as indelibly stamped on the viewer's mind.Pierre has kept his illness secret, yet when faced with the dire concept of a transplant he confides in his sister &Eacute;lise (Juliette Binoche), a single mother of three, who takes him in to fill his boring days of self confinement. There is a palpable magic between the two as &Eacute;lise attempts to bring Pierre out into the world of hope and of living. Incidental to her life are trips to the market where she observes the lives of the grocers and discovers their private lifestyles, information shared freely with the viewer. A Parisian North African communicates with his brother at home with a postcard of Paris, seducing the brother to brave all odds to come to the city. We also meet a jaded art historian Roland Verneuil (Fabrice Luchini) whose father has just died, an event that devastates his emotional brother Philippe (Franois Cluzet): Roland proceeds to have an affair with a student but his physical awakening is abruptly altered by the realities of Parisian life while Philippe progresses through his seemingly mundane existence toward a surprise ending. The grocers seek adventures with a group of girls among whom is the ex-wife of one of the men and in the process we observe the varying reactions of interpersonal relationships tested away from the eyes of group participation. All of these stories are white noise to Pierre's situation, and though &Eacute;lise is able to make Pierre 'dance again' at a party of his fellow dancers she organizes, in the end Pierre is left to care for &Eacute;lise's children while &Eacute;lise finally opens her frozen heart to a new romance. At this point Pierre receives the inevitable telephone call that a transplant is ready, and as he proceeds to the hospital he opens his mind to the beauties of Paris. Some of the vignettes we have observed are completed while most simply continue - just like life in the glorious city so often considered the city of love.All of the many roles are enacted by gifted actors, the cinematography offers us a different view of Paris than that of postcards and travel brochures, and the musical score ranges from popular music to the haunting 'Gnossiemme No. 1' of Erik Satie which is Pierre's theme music. At times the viewer feels lost in the complex overlay of the many stories being told, but settling back in a chair and just absorbing the film results in an evening of Parisian intoxication.

We should all be as prettily perhaps dying as Romain Duris, a professional dancer who is told one day that his heart is going and he will need a transplant.  What he does then is mope around his lovely Paris apartment, which seems to overlook a cemetery, babysit his semi-estranged sister's three kids when she (Juliette Binoche) moves in to take care of him, and observe the comings and goings of his neighborhood.  He develops a crush on the student across the way who is being stalked by text messages from her professor.  And so it goes -- the professor has a damaged relationship with his brother, the vegetable man where Binoche does her daily shopping still loves his ex-wife, etc., etc.  The best scene is when the smarmy professor dances to Wilson Pickett's Land of a Thousand Dances, and it is the song, not the dance that makes that scene.  There's lots more, most of it scarcely worth a second glance, until the final scene of Pierre's taxi ride to his transplant appointment when director Klapisch appears to suddenly realize he hasn't shown us enough of The Eternal City so under the pretext of demonstrations throughout Paris necessitating a roundabout route to the hospital, the ride becomes a Paris-lover's dream with many long loving shots of its boulevards and monuments, and of course the obligatory glances at some of the characters whose lives have glanced off Pierre's.

His sister, Elaine (Binoche), is the only one in his family he initially tells of his condition and she promptly moves her and her children to live with him though they have previously been distant.  Pierre, a former dancer, is no longer able to perform due to his heart condition, and now finds pleasure in observing the lives of those around him--nods to Hitchcock's &#34;Rear Window&#34;.  Among those is an attractive young woman living in an apartment across the street from his, and her story is perhaps just as interesting--she is torn between two suitors, one a fellow student and the other an older man.  While Elaine is assisting Pierre in the physical sense by helping with meals and cleaning, she benefits as much as him if not more from their repaired relationship--after Pierre convinces her to live her life fully, Elaine opens up to a friendly longtime acquaintance, with satisfying results.The acting in this film is brilliant, even though I speak English and watched most of this film on mute, just reading the subtitles, I didn't feel that I missed out. Binoche's Elaine is melancholy and wounded at times, and sexy and playful at others--depicting her character in a believable and yet striking way.  Pierre, the lead, is played by Duris and the expressiveness in his body language shows his introspection and struggle with his own feelings about mortality.The only thing that I didn't quite get was the plot...a few of the stories fit well and intertwined, but a lot of the extraneous side stories didn't really fit in with the main plot and instead confused me, making the film difficult to follow (i.e. the man immigrating to Paris from Africa, the whole backstory with the professor, etc.)  The film was overall good, because of its memorable acting, but the tangled web of story lines left a lot to be desired.",3,"Brilliant acting, disjointed plot",1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,2140,"['Paris', 'complex', 'web', 'interconnected', 'stories', 'messily', 'together', 'leaving', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'also', 'simulating', 'messiness', 'real', 'life.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Pierre', 'Duris', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'dying', 'heart', 'condition', 'will', 'need', 'transplant', 'order', 'survive', 'sister', 'Elaine', 'Binoche', 'only', 'one', 'family', 'initially', 'condition', 'promptly', 'children', 'live', 'have', 'previously', 'been', 'distant', 'Pierre', 'former', 'dancer', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'perform', 'due', 'heart', 'condition', 'now', 'pleasure', 'observing', 'lives', 'nods', 'Hitchcock', '34', 'Rear', 'Window', '34', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'living', 'apartment', 'street', 'story', 'perhaps', 'just', 'interesting', 'torn', 'two', 'suitors', 'one', 'fellow', 'student', 'other', 'older', 'man', 'Elaine', 'assisting', 'Pierre', 'physical', 'sense', 'helping', 'meals', 'cleaning', 'benefits', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'repaired', 'relationship', 'Pierre', 'live', 'life', 'fully', 'Elaine', 'up', 'friendly', 'longtime', 'acquaintance', 'satisfying', 'results.The', 'acting', 'film', 'brilliant', 'even', 'speak', 'English', 'watched', 'most', 'film', 'mute', 'just', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'missed', 'out', 'Binoche', 'Elaine', 'melancholy', 'wounded', 'times', 'sexy', 'playful', 'others', 'depicting', 'character', 'believable', 'yet', 'striking', 'way', 'Pierre', 'lead', 'played', 'Duris', 'expressiveness', 'body', 'language', 'introspection', 'struggle', 'own', 'feelings', 'mortality.The', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'was', 'plot', 'few', 'stories', 'fit', 'well', 'intertwined', 'lot', 'extraneous', 'side', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'main', 'plot', 'instead', 'confused', 'making', 'film', 'difficult', 'follow', 'i.e', 'man', 'immigrating', 'Paris', 'Africa', 'whole', 'backstory', 'professor', 'etc', 'film', 'was', 'overall', 'good', 'memorable', 'acting', 'tangled', 'web', 'story', 'lines', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired']",N/A

After about 20 visits over the last 40 years and some brief spells living there, I love any chance to be in Paree, even if just in spirit, so Parisian films delight and intoxicate with memories and the promise of another visite. Paris the movie offers some nice moments and some good acting, and is a fine film...but as a Parisian classic I can't really rank it up there with Amelie, Breathless, Le Dernier Metro, Day Of The Jackal, Diva, Les Ripoux, and a few others.The highlights include the acting of Binoche and Lucchini, a good script, and of course some fine shots of the town. But despite the realer than usual feel, something didn't quite click for me here. Many might call this episodic flick Altmanesque, and I'd agree, for better and for worse. It's got his multiple storylines, one or three characters too many to get much involved with any of them, and an ending that's a little too forced and tidy, even though nothing is resolved. Which is fine, but I wasn't left with the same feeling of wonder I get when watching any of the other mentioned films, or the same longing to jump on a plane that instant and walk the town for 12 hours day after day.I speak decent French and the subtitles are actually more accurate than usual, though the language is actually nowhere near as idiomatic as one might expect...which is one of my qualms here. It sets out to be a panoply of Paris viewpoints, but there's less local feel than you might expect for each arrondissement and the very different vibes each place has, except perhaps the Pavillon des Viandes...they got that right!The stories are interesting but never really gripped me, and there was more angst and less amused Gallic shrug than I've encountered in the town and France in general. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the happy slyness I love in so many Parisians one meets during non-tourist season (go in late fall, winter, and early spring!) seems rather absent. But perhaps that's a function of the town being, as is said here, for rich people now. It can't be getting any cheaper to live there, no doubt. It's the working class Paris I was looking forward to seeing more of here, but it all felt like a movie in the end.A good movie, well shot and acted, no doubt...but without the magic of so many other Paris films that seem more suffused with the City of Light's glow, both inside and out.",4,"It's no Breathless or Amelie, but it's good",1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,2440,"['3.8', 'starsParis', 'favorite', 'city', 'SF', 'Berlin', 'close', 'seconds', '20', 'visits', 'last', '40', 'years', 'brief', 'spells', 'living', 'there', 'love', 'chance', 'be', 'Paree', 'even', 'just', 'spirit', 'so', 'Parisian', 'films', 'delight', 'intoxicate', 'memories', 'promise', 'visite', 'Paris', 'movie', 'nice', 'moments', 'good', 'acting', 'fine', 'film', 'Parisian', 'classic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'Amelie', 'Breathless', 'Le', 'Dernier', 'Metro', 'Day', 'Jackal', 'Diva', 'Les', 'Ripoux', 'few', 'others.The', 'highlights', 'include', 'acting', 'Binoche', 'Lucchini', 'good', 'script', 'course', 'fine', 'shots', 'town', 'realer', 'usual', 'feel', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'click', 'here', 'Many', 'might', 'call', 'episodic', 'flick', 'Altmanesque', ""'d"", 'agree', 'better', 'worse', 'got', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'one', 'three', 'characters', 'too', 'many', 'get', 'much', 'involved', 'ending', 'little', 'too', 'forced', 'tidy', 'even', 'nothing', 'resolved', 'Which', 'fine', 'was', ""n't"", 'left', 'same', 'feeling', 'wonder', 'get', 'when', 'watching', 'other', 'mentioned', 'films', 'same', 'longing', 'jump', 'plane', 'instant', 'walk', 'town', '12', 'hours', 'day', 'day.I', 'speak', 'decent', 'French', 'subtitles', 'are', 'actually', 'more', 'accurate', 'usual', 'language', 'actually', 'nowhere', 'as', 'idiomatic', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'one', 'qualms', 'here', 'out', 'be', 'panoply', 'Paris', 'viewpoints', 'less', 'local', 'feel', 'might', 'expect', 'arrondissement', 'very', 'different', 'vibes', 'place', 'perhaps', 'Pavillon', 'des', 'Viandes', 'got', 'right', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'never', 'really', 'gripped', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'angst', 'less', 'amused', 'Gallic', 'shrug', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'town', 'France', 'general', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'happy', 'slyness', 'love', 'so', 'many', 'Parisians', 'one', 'meets', 'non-tourist', 'season', 'go', 'late', 'fall', 'winter', 'early', 'spring', 'rather', 'absent', 'perhaps', 'function', 'town', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'rich', 'people', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'cheaper', 'live', 'there', 'doubt', 'working', 'class', 'Paris', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'here', 'felt', 'movie', 'end.A', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'shot', 'acted', 'doubt', 'magic', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Paris', 'films', 'seem', 'more', 'suffused', 'City', 'Light', 'glow', 'inside', 'out']",N/A

Maybe it's that France itself is such a beautiful and evocative country, maybe it's that the French have a lifestyle that, for us non-French, appears so stylish and romantic... whatever... but when they get it right they really are in a different class, and ""Paris"" most definitely gets it right.Beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted, and underpinned by a superb soundtrack, the film explores ""real"" peoples' lives slowly and above all subtly. Not a great deal happens, and there are no conclusions to the stories involved - a guy gets diagnosed with a life threatening heart condition, another chap falls in love with one of his students, a lonely single mother and a market stall trader are hesitantly drawn together, and an African dreams of getting to Paris to start a new life. That's about it really. But it's the way that this is all put together & explored that makes the film, and which achieves its objective of trying to capture what Paris is to people who live there or dream of living there - which of course means that its infused with their, often vague, hopes & fears and it has no clear & tidy ""Hollywood style"" endings... life's not like that.At times funny, at times charming, and ultimately quite moving, Klapisch directs the film without reverting to heavy-handed sentimentality or high drama to make his points.... in fact, exactly the opposite: witness the fleeting, beautifully poignant shot at the end of the film as the African compares the view on the postcard of Paris that has driven him to make his journey there, and which underpins his hopes for the future, with the reality of it... nothing more needs to be said or filmed to capture what he must be feeling.Perhaps the greatest credit to ""Paris"" is that, even though it's two hours long, subtitled (which is never the easiest way to watch a film), and devoid of any clever plot twists or unexpected surprises to hold your attention, by the end of it all... you really don't want it to end.

Maybe it was just the film maker's point of view.The story line is one that sounds good on paper....glimpses of the lives of several sets of people of different social groups and how their lives interact.  It's an idea that has been done very well elsewhere, as in ""Crash.""  Here somehow it doesn't work so well. The main story line concerns a young male cabaret dancer who has just been told that he has a heart disease and that only a transplant can save him and that gives him just a 50-50 chance of survival.  His sister, a single mother with three small children, begs a little time off from her social work job in order to move in to take care of him.  Somehow although he's not bed-ridden and seems to function well enough he can't manage to help her with any of the housework so she does it all while he mopes around looking out the the window and goes through old photos. Every time we see him a sad tune plays on the piano.  Somehow that's not enough to give me any sympathy for him.  He calls a girl he once danced with in 6th grade to tell her how much he loved it. She hangs up so he drinks a beer and vomits and the social worker sister has to leave her job to rush home and hold his head.That's about the tone of it.  At one point when the dancer gets a call saying there's a heart waiting for him he rides in a cab and waxes supremely sentimental about Life in Paris....""Oh why don't these people realize how lucky they are!""  He does utter one true statement...that no one is happy there and they love to complain.  That's probably why this film, which is supposed to be meaningful is such a downer.There are a few good moments, mostly with Juliette Binoche who is still quite beautiful.  The best is when she does a strip tease before the guy from the fruit stand.  It's not really worth sitting through all the other tedious, pseudo-meaningful stuff though.

He made 35 films in a long career and they feature ensemble casts whose stories intertwine. Cedric Klapisch, a talented French writer and director, follows the Altman model.My first Klapisch film was Chacun Cherche Son Chat (When the Cat's Away)from 1996 which features a declining Paris neighborhood with well written characters. Paris is like an expanded version of that film.My next two Klapisch films, L'Auberge Espagnole from 2002 filmed in Barcelona and Russian Dolls, the 2005 sequel, featuring St. Petersburg, follow an interesting group of international students.I believe Paris is his best film so far. It shows manyfaces of the City of Light and the ensemble cast is led by Romain Duris and Juliette Binoche.
