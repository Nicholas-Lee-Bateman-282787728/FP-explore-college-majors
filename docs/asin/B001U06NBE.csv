Basically  its a nice tale of friendship, love, and character with some humorous and oh my god moments.

1237678,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001U06NBE,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Yes the movie is about what it sounded like it might be about, not ten inch sandwiches. Oddly this is a sweet film that has an adult back story to it. The actors are very pretty, watch this film for the visual appeal / pictures, not the story / articles.Three women meet at a sandwich shop run by a hippie. They spend a lot of time talking about boys. The hippie owner is in love with a hippie chick across the street that runs some kind of fortune telling store. And there is a tough guy with a heart of gold that makes sandwiches. There are a few other people that ""work"" at the sandwich shop, but really they serve no purpose in the film - well the occasional punch line or butt of a joke.The point of the film seems to be happily ever after, all rainbows and unicorns. The three women in this film are gorgeous. That is also the point of the film. How do these three young women navigate boys and sex? One woman uses men for her own fun. Another is a virgin and doesn't really know what to do with men. And the third learned what happens with boys at age 15 when she became pregnant and had to give her daughter up for adoption. The story has the full spectrum of women desiring a relationship.The film is an hour and forty minutes long. It is about fifteen minutes too long. Most of the story lines just take too long to play out. The film was done in standard television style; in fact if it weren't for the R rating, this could easily be a sitcom on regular television. The characters were all well cast. I hated the music. This was some of the worst movie music in captivity. Most of it sounded like the royalty free music that was found on the internet somewhere.The film is rated R for good reason. There is a lot of strong language. There is a lot of sex talked about or heard in the background (one of the women masturbates off camera while her friends encourage her). Danneel Harris / Ackels is not afraid to take off her clothes and show off her skills in the bedroom. She is particularly beautiful. The standing joke for Tish the morning after is to rate the guys she beds. She uses a size doesn't matter scale with 10 inches being something extra special. This film is not for younger viewers.The DVD has a mess of bonus features. The deleted scenes needed to remain deleted. The outtakes were just slightly funny. I couldn't stand to watch the making of featurette, recording the music, and director commentary.Oddly there was something about this film I liked. I can't exactly figure it out, the acting was fairly cardboard, the story line was predictable, and I hated the music. Maybe what I liked, this is just a silly simple film for the summer. It isn't exactly women turning the tables on the guy movie, but it is a little bit.",4,Get it for the pictures not the articles,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,2750,"['Yes', 'movie', 'what', 'sounded', 'might', 'be', 'about', 'not', 'ten', 'inch', 'sandwiches', 'Oddly', 'sweet', 'film', 'adult', 'back', 'story', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'pretty', 'watch', 'film', 'visual', 'appeal', '/', 'pictures', 'not', 'story', '/', 'articles.Three', 'women', 'meet', 'sandwich', 'shop', 'run', 'hippie', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'talking', 'boys', 'hippie', 'owner', 'love', 'hippie', 'chick', 'street', 'kind', 'fortune', 'telling', 'store', 'tough', 'guy', 'heart', 'gold', 'sandwiches', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'work', 'sandwich', 'shop', 'really', 'serve', 'purpose', 'film', 'well', 'occasional', 'punch', 'line', 'butt', 'joke.The', 'point', 'film', 'be', 'happily', 'ever', 'rainbows', 'unicorns', 'three', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'also', 'point', 'film', 'How', 'do', 'three', 'young', 'women', 'navigate', 'boys', 'sex', 'One', 'woman', 'men', 'own', 'fun', 'virgin', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'men', 'third', 'learned', 'what', 'boys', 'age', '15', 'when', 'became', 'pregnant', 'had', 'give', 'daughter', 'up', 'adoption', 'story', 'full', 'spectrum', 'women', 'desiring', 'relationship.The', 'film', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'long', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'Most', 'story', 'lines', 'just', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'play', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'standard', 'television', 'style', 'fact', 'were', ""n't"", 'R', 'rating', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'sitcom', 'regular', 'television', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'cast', 'hated', 'music', 'was', 'worst', 'movie', 'music', 'captivity', 'Most', 'sounded', 'royalty', 'free', 'music', 'was', 'found', 'internet', 'somewhere.The', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'good', 'reason', 'lot', 'strong', 'language', 'lot', 'sex', 'talked', 'heard', 'background', 'one', 'women', 'camera', 'friends', 'encourage', 'Danneel', 'Harris', '/', 'Ackels', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'show', 'off', 'skills', 'bedroom', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'standing', 'joke', 'Tish', 'morning', 'rate', 'guys', 'size', ""n't"", 'matter', 'scale', '10', 'inches', 'being', 'something', 'extra', 'special', 'film', 'not', 'younger', 'viewers.The', 'DVD', 'mess', 'bonus', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'needed', 'remain', 'deleted', 'outtakes', 'were', 'just', 'slightly', 'funny', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watch', 'making', 'featurette', 'recording', 'music', 'director', 'commentary.Oddly', 'was', 'something', 'film', 'liked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'figure', 'out', 'acting', 'was', 'fairly', 'cardboard', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'predictable', 'hated', 'music', 'Maybe', 'what', 'liked', 'just', 'silly', 'simple', 'film', 'summer', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'women', 'turning', 'tables', 'guy', 'movie', 'little', 'bit']",Ten Inch Hero

The acting overall is superb.Although best known for his roles in Dark Angel and Supernatural, Ackles is spectacular in this film -- if you haven't seen him in this very-different role, you will be highly impressed.

1237683,A3O4QM66IHX8KD,B001U06NBE,Gabe in Nash,"[1, 1]","So going into this movie, you hear ten inches your mind will most likely go somewhere kind of vulgar. However, a five dollar foot long will just make you salivate. Now that some of us have snickered like a bunch of teenagers, this movie has a little more than expected. With each couple you will learn that there are underlying themes of hidden pasts, superficial vs hidden qualities, tolerance, acceptance of yourself and others, and a few views on growing up (even for ""grownups""). The acting and writing aren't the best but the movie has enough heart in it that you will forgive some of the bad dialogue and poorly delivered lines. The ending is a little contrived but it is a romantic comedy and one can expect nothing less. The one thing in this movie that stands out as extraordinary is the soundtrack. It has some original and some well known songs to round out the mood music for the film that will have you googling the film for that fact alone. So all in all, the acting is pretty decent, the writing while weak at some points does have more good moments than bad, the characters are intriguing at times, and there is some eye candy for those wanting that R rating to have more than just language.

I had never heard of the film or the people in it.  I bought it expecting it to have been filmed entirely, or at least mostly, in Santa Cruz where it was set. (I thought that even if it was awful, I could turn off the audio and just look at the scenery.) I was wrong about that, but I am very glad I bought it. It is sweet & funny & sharp & smart & conveys the spirit of Santa Cruz better than any other movie I have seen, even if  most of it wasn't filmed there.

Through the course of the movie, with the support of their friends, they discover a few truths about themselves. And, just maybe, we discover a few truths about ourselves.  This was a small budget, independent film that could not find a distributor even though it was well-received at several film festivals.

Spencer ""Kitty""","[4, 5]","Every once in a while I like to find an obscure movie title, with a few ""familiar"" but not super-mainstream faces, with the hopes that I'll be entertained. Seems the movies that are heavily promoted these days (not all but some) miss the mark entirely, yet little projects like this seem to be overlooked but are better made, have more character development, etc...Ten Inch Hero is an independent romantic comedy film from 2007. Yeah, romantic comedy with all that that entails. The film was directed by David Mackay and written by Betsy Morris. The Ten Inch Hero of the title refers to a large submarine sandwich; as the majority of the characters we're introduced to work in a little sandwich place based in Santa Cruz.The story revolves mainly around a young art student Piper played by Elisabeth Harnois. She is pleasant, playful, and lovely. She's moved there with the intention of looking for her daughter (she'd given up for adoption 8 years ago) and based on the little details given to her by the woman adopting she believes she's found Julia (her daughter). Piper gets a job at local sandwich shop and meets the other employees; Jen (Clea DuVall), a shy but kind girl who has an email romance with a stranger known as Fuzzy22. If you watched ANY of the teen movies from the 90's you'll recognize her. Tish (Danneel Harris) is a sexually audacious, emotionally disconnected but beautiful young woman doing her best to avoid love. Priestly (Jensen Ackles-from Supernatural) is the free-spirited goth of the gang, donning his outspoken screen t's and a colorful mohawk, who uses humor and sarcasm to disguise his own feelings and emotions. The shop is owned by Trucker, a surfer child of the '60s who's in love with Zo, the mysterious woman and owner from the shop across the street. Tucker himself isn't all that he seems. Interestingly Jensen Ackles & Danneel Harris are now real life husband and wife, having met while filming this movie. Each character portrays a rather STRONG stereotypical/literal interpretation of themselves...the shy, geeky computer nerd with an online crush, the promiscuous beauty who really might have a warmer heart after all, the overly tattooed, over pierced, strangely dressed guy who has more to offer that just sarcasm and jabs, etc...The movie itself, of course, surrounds the foundations of love, friendship, relationships, self worth, parenting, and self actuality. There are a few quarky, warm moments, as well as disturbing ones that make you understand, relate, and or connect with the characters in one way or another. If nothing else it is an entertaining watch in relation to all the other typical romantic comedies out there.",4,A Sandwich Place I Wish was Around the Corner,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,2677,"['once', 'while', 'like', 'find', 'obscure', 'movie', 'title', 'few', 'familiar', 'not', 'super-mainstream', 'hopes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', 'movies', 'are', 'heavily', 'promoted', 'days', 'not', 'miss', 'mark', 'entirely', 'yet', 'little', 'projects', 'seem', 'be', 'overlooked', 'are', 'better', 'made', 'have', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'etc', 'Ten', 'Inch', 'Hero', 'independent', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'film', '2007', 'Yeah', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'David', 'Mackay', 'written', 'Betsy', 'Morris', 'Ten', 'Inch', 'Hero', 'title', 'refers', 'large', 'submarine', 'sandwich', 'majority', 'characters', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'work', 'little', 'sandwich', 'place', 'based', 'Santa', 'Cruz.The', 'story', 'mainly', 'young', 'art', 'student', 'Piper', 'played', 'Elisabeth', 'Harnois', 'pleasant', 'playful', 'lovely', 'moved', 'there', 'intention', 'looking', 'daughter', ""'d"", 'given', 'up', 'adoption', '8', 'years', 'ago', 'based', 'little', 'details', 'given', 'woman', 'adopting', 'found', 'Julia', 'daughter', 'Piper', 'job', 'local', 'sandwich', 'shop', 'other', 'employees', 'Jen', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'shy', 'kind', 'girl', 'who', 'email', 'romance', 'stranger', 'known', 'Fuzzy22', 'watched', 'teen', 'movies', '90', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'Tish', 'Danneel', 'Harris', 'sexually', 'audacious', 'emotionally', 'disconnected', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'doing', 'best', 'avoid', 'love', 'Priestly', 'Jensen', 'Ackles-from', 'Supernatural', 'free-spirited', 'goth', 'gang', 'donning', 'outspoken', 'screen', 't', 'colorful', 'mohawk', 'who', 'humor', 'sarcasm', 'disguise', 'own', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'shop', 'owned', 'Trucker', 'surfer', 'child', ""'60s"", 'who', 'love', 'Zo', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'owner', 'shop', 'street', 'Tucker', ""n't"", 'all', 'Interestingly', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Danneel', 'Harris', 'are', 'now', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'wife', 'having', 'met', 'filming', 'movie', 'character', 'rather', 'STRONG', 'stereotypical/literal', 'interpretation', 'shy', 'geeky', 'computer', 'nerd', 'online', 'crush', 'promiscuous', 'beauty', 'who', 'really', 'might', 'have', 'warmer', 'heart', 'overly', 'tattooed', 'pierced', 'strangely', 'dressed', 'guy', 'who', 'more', 'offer', 'just', 'sarcasm', 'jabs', 'etc', 'movie', 'course', 'foundations', 'love', 'friendship', 'relationships', 'worth', 'parenting', 'actuality', 'are', 'few', 'quarky', 'warm', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'disturbing', 'ones', 'make', 'understand', 'relate', 'connect', 'characters', 'one', 'way', 'nothing', 'else', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'relation', 'other', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'there']",Ten Inch Hero
