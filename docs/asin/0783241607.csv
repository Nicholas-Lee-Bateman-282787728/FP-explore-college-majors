70929,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,0783241607,A Customer,"[1, 1]","In &quot;Bowfinger&quot;, Steve Martin plays a wanna-be film maker with a small group of dimwitted followers, destined to make a movie as his dream come true. The problem is he can't find any actor willing to take part in his scripts, until he devises a plan that he's sure will put 'Bowfinger Productions' on the charts. Eddie Murphy plays a popular Hollywood actor named Kit Ramsey, who struggles with psychological problems and has a slight hatred for white people. Martin feeds his collegues the idea that Murphy agreed to do his alien movie called 'Chubby Rain', but doesnt want to meet the crew or even see the video camera. Murphy begins to lose whatever is left of his sanity when strange people start coming up to him on the street with talk of aliens coming to Earth. Little by little, Martin's crew pieces together footage of them unknowingly driving Murphy out of his mind...all the while thinking that they are making the greatest movie ever with America's hottest star. If anyone deserves the bulk of the credit, it's Eddie Murphy for his hilarious performance as the unstable Kit Ramsey, and his nerdy brother Jiff. The movie drew little attention when first released, which is surprising considering Murphy's incredible comedic role. The movie was done perfectly and I think the very original idea should bring more people to watch. I give this movie 5 stars for what is probably THE funniest film of the 90s.",5,This Is a Great Flick,986169600,"04 2, 2001",2001,1425,"['quot', 'Bowfinger', 'quot', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'wanna-be', 'film', 'maker', 'small', 'group', 'dimwitted', 'followers', 'destined', 'make', 'movie', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'actor', 'willing', 'take', 'part', 'scripts', 'plan', 'sure', 'will', 'put', ""'Bowfinger"", 'Productions', 'charts', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'popular', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'named', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'who', 'psychological', 'problems', 'slight', 'hatred', 'white', 'people', 'Martin', 'collegues', 'idea', 'Murphy', 'agreed', 'do', 'alien', 'movie', 'called', ""'Chubby"", 'Rain', 'want', 'meet', 'crew', 'even', 'see', 'video', 'camera', 'Murphy', 'lose', 'left', 'sanity', 'when', 'strange', 'people', 'start', 'coming', 'up', 'street', 'talk', 'aliens', 'coming', 'Earth', 'Little', 'little', 'Martin', 'crew', 'together', 'footage', 'unknowingly', 'driving', 'Murphy', 'mind', 'while', 'thinking', 'are', 'making', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'America', 'hottest', 'star', 'anyone', 'bulk', 'credit', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'unstable', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'nerdy', 'brother', 'Jiff', 'movie', 'drew', 'little', 'attention', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'surprising', 'considering', 'Murphy', 'incredible', 'comedic', 'role', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'perfectly', 'think', 'very', 'original', 'idea', 'should', 'bring', 'more', 'people', 'watch', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'what', 'probably', 'THE', 'funniest', 'film', '90s']",N/A

70933,A9998RE3AEA95,0783241607,Alex,"[1, 5]","&quot;Bowfinger&quot; is about a ruse; a ruse so big it results in the production of a movie starring Kit Ramsey, a major movie star - without him ever knowing. Unfortunately, this premise doesn't generate quite as many laughs as it seems capable of: we can't laugh with the characters because they aren't in on the joke, and we can't laugh at them because they are so darn pathetic. The viewer is caught in a cruel limbo, forced to watch deserving, sympathetic people make fools of themselves.Perhaps I should restate myself: not everybody involved in filming &quot;Chubby Rain&quot; is sympathetic. Bobby Bowfinger, the producer, is too machiavellian to be likeable. He's turning fifty soon, which would apparently bar him from making it big, so he is determined to produce his magnum opus at any cost. His black-and-white view of the world generates a few laughs (&quot;There, there, there's the door,&quot; he consoles Daisy who comes in to audition, but can't pay cash), but at times he is too ruthless to be funny.Daisy steps off the bus with the words &quot;where do I go to be a star?&quot;, but she turns out to be neither simple-minded nor naive. Her plan is to sleep her way to the top, and eventually she does get into bed with everyone on the set. That's funny the first few times, but not too funny.The two people who really deserve better are Jiff, Kit Ramsey's double, and Carol, a lowly actress who's been kept on hold for years. Carol believes wholeheartely in the project, and the viewers are getting ready for the Big Revelation when she'll find out the truth and be devastated (if you don't know what I'm talking about, watch &quot;Galaxy Quest,&quot; &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; or &quot;Chicken Run&quot; - they all use this exact plot device).Jiff has the unenviable job of being Kit's double - meaning that he must play Kit in scenes Bowfinger couldn't possibly shoot with a secret camera. A good example is the scene where Keith Kinkade, the hero of &quot;Chubby Rain,&quot; must run across a highway. Bowfinger tells Jiff that the cars are driven by stuntmen, deposits him on one side, sets up the camera, and gives the signal &quot;run!&quot;. Jiff runs. Funny in concept - but not on the screen, where the viewer is forced to watch poor Jiff run heroicly across eight lanes of speeding traffic, with tears streaming down his face.However, a sequence of scenes makes &quot;Bowfinger&quot; very much worth watching, and these are the scenes of the actual filming of &quot;Chubby Rain.&quot; Since Bowfinger, with his $2184 budget, obviously can't pay Kit to star in the film, he decides to film him in secret. One thing is on Bowfinger's side - Kit has a mortal fear of aliens, and regularly attends Mind Head sessions to get &quot;re-adjusted&quot;. When strangers - Bowfinger's actors - start coming up to him on the street, addressing him as Keith, and telling him that he must save humanity from an alien invasion, Kit is understandably horrified. Carol remarks: &quot;His fear is so real,&quot; watching Kit run past in absolute terror.As a spoof on low-dudget films - and people who make them, &quot;Bowfinger&quot; fails completely. As a comedy, it has a few jewels surrounded by a lot of mediocre footage, but is very much watchable.",3,Funny in principle - not on the screen.,1003536000,"10 20, 2001",2001,3266,"['quot', 'Bowfinger', 'quot', 'ruse', 'ruse', 'so', 'big', 'results', 'production', 'movie', 'starring', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'major', 'movie', 'star', 'ever', 'knowing', 'Unfortunately', 'premise', ""n't"", 'generate', 'quite', 'many', 'laughs', 'capable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'joke', 'ca', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'are', 'so', 'darn', 'pathetic', 'viewer', 'caught', 'cruel', 'limbo', 'forced', 'watch', 'deserving', 'sympathetic', 'people', 'make', 'fools', 'themselves.Perhaps', 'should', 'restate', 'not', 'everybody', 'involved', 'filming', 'quot', 'Chubby', 'Rain', 'quot', 'sympathetic', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'producer', 'too', 'machiavellian', 'be', 'likeable', 'turning', 'fifty', 'soon', 'would', 'apparently', 'bar', 'making', 'big', 'determined', 'produce', 'magnum', 'opus', 'cost', 'black-and-white', 'view', 'world', 'few', 'laughs', 'quot', 'door', 'quot', 'Daisy', 'who', 'audition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'cash', 'times', 'too', 'ruthless', 'be', 'funny.Daisy', 'steps', 'bus', 'words', 'quot', 'where', 'do', 'go', 'be', 'star', 'quot', 'out', 'be', 'simple-minded', 'naive', 'plan', 'sleep', 'way', 'top', 'eventually', 'get', 'bed', 'everyone', 'set', 'funny', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'too', 'funny.The', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'deserve', 'better', 'are', 'Jiff', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'double', 'Carol', 'lowly', 'actress', 'who', 'been', 'kept', 'hold', 'years', 'Carol', 'wholeheartely', 'project', 'viewers', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'Big', 'Revelation', 'when', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'be', 'devastated', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'watch', 'quot', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'quot', 'quot', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'quot', 'quot', 'Chicken', 'Run', 'quot', 'use', 'exact', 'plot', 'device', '.Jiff', 'unenviable', 'job', 'being', 'Kit', 'double', 'meaning', 'must', 'play', 'Kit', 'scenes', 'Bowfinger', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'shoot', 'secret', 'camera', 'good', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Keith', 'Kinkade', 'hero', 'quot', 'Chubby', 'Rain', 'quot', 'must', 'run', 'highway', 'Bowfinger', 'Jiff', 'cars', 'are', 'driven', 'stuntmen', 'one', 'side', 'up', 'camera', 'signal', 'quot', 'run', 'quot', 'Jiff', 'Funny', 'concept', 'not', 'screen', 'where', 'viewer', 'forced', 'watch', 'poor', 'Jiff', 'run', 'heroicly', 'eight', 'lanes', 'speeding', 'traffic', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'face.However', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Bowfinger', 'quot', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'scenes', 'actual', 'filming', 'quot', 'Chubby', 'Rain.', 'quot', 'Bowfinger', '2184', 'budget', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'Kit', 'star', 'film', 'film', 'secret', 'One', 'thing', 'Bowfinger', 'side', 'Kit', 'mortal', 'fear', 'aliens', 'regularly', 'attends', 'Mind', 'Head', 'sessions', 'get', 'quot', 're-adjusted', 'quot', 'When', 'strangers', 'Bowfinger', 'actors', 'start', 'coming', 'up', 'street', 'addressing', 'Keith', 'telling', 'must', 'save', 'humanity', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Kit', 'understandably', 'horrified', 'Carol', 'remarks', 'quot', 'fear', 'so', 'real', 'quot', 'watching', 'Kit', 'run', 'past', 'absolute', 'terror.As', 'spoof', 'low-dudget', 'films', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'quot', 'Bowfinger', 'quot', 'completely', 'comedy', 'few', 'jewels', 'surrounded', 'lot', 'mediocre', 'footage', 'very', 'much', 'watchable']",N/A

Steve Martin wrote it, and it has the true mark of genius in it.  Eddie Murphy deserved an Academy Award nomination (no lie!) for his outstanding portrayals of Kit and Jiff Ramsey.  Without the use of any laytex (a la 'The Klumps'), he becomes two totally different people just through the use of different posture (a swagger vs. a slouch) or facial expression (a menacing glare vs. wide-eyed glee).I've watched Bowfinger four times now, and each time I pick up something new to laugh at.  For example, I learned that Steve Martin at one time dated Anne Heche, which will cause you to look at Heather Graham's Daisy character in a new light.I think what I liked best about the movie was Bobby Bowfinger's (Martin) fervent desrire to make his film.  The premise behind Murphy's involvement in Bowfinger's &quot;Chubby Rain&quot; (great title, or what?) is so ludicrous it defies description here, but what makes it work is that Bowfinger is trying so damn hard to make it work and you really feel like with his manic energy that he can pull it off.Don't expect Farrelly-style humor.

It's the story of an unsuccessful producer/director who hatches a crazy scheme: to film an alien invasion sci-fier with a popular action star (Eddie Murphy), but Bobby Bowfinger has to do so without the actor knowing he's in the picture.This is fairly easy to do because Kit Ramsey is a hyper-paranoid who's #1 fear is aliens. So while a camera secretly rolls, Bowfinger's actors accost Kit on the street, say their lines, and his terrified reactions are genuine. These weird encounters push Kit over an emotional cliff and he's force into seclusion. Now Bowfinger needs a lookalike and he finds one, a simpleton named ""Jiff,"" a dead ringer for Ramsey. Jiff's ambition is to be a go-fer, so Bowfinger hires him to both run for coffee and play non-dialogue in his budding fright film masterpiece, ""Chubby Rain.""It's a crazy story of amateur thespians and a con man moviemaker who constantly fools people into doing his bidding, but the film also comments on the shallowness of the motion picture industry.Directed by Frank Oz, this underappreciated farce also features Heather Graham, Jamie Kennedy, Christine Baranski, Barry Newman, Robert Downey Jr. (as a movie studio exec.) and Terence Stamp (as Kit's mental health guru).

Bowfinger: Betsy? It's now or never. We are gonna make a movie.=======================================================""Bowfinger"" is an adequate comedy, but it is not ground breaking, nor is it slap-your-knee funny. It targets a few subjects for parody, such as Scientology, but the target's bull's eye is the movie biz and the lengths people will go to make it in Tinseltown. Robert K. Bowfinger (Steve Martin) wants to make a movie in the worst way, and the worst way is the way he makes it--with reluctant star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) who doesn't even know he is in the movie. The other ""actors"" walk up to him and deliver their lines, getting him to react, and they film it with hidden cameras and various subterfuges.The rag tag bunch of movie makers also utilize the talents of Kit's brother, Jiff (Eddie Murphy also). Eddie is the best actor to play dual roles since Jim Varney in ""Earnest Goes to Jail."" In ""Bowfinger"" he doesn't need any rubber suits but he has two distinct personalities and you quickly forget that both are played by Murphy.---------------------------------Kit: It's too cerebral! We're trying to make a movie here, not a film!================================================Bowfinger is certainly not too cerebral. He wants to make a movie, not a film. Here he auditions Jiff for a role in his magnum opus: ""Chubby Rain.""--------------------------------------------Robert K. Bowfinger: Do you have any experience in motion pictures?Jiff Ramsey: Uh, well, yeah, quite a bit, actually, I have quite a bit of experience. I'm an active, uh, renter at Blockbuster, and I, um, attend the filmed cinema, uh, as much as possible, weekly, bi-weekly, inter-week-... intermediately.Robert K. Bowfinger: Would you be willing to cut your hair?Jiff Ramsey: [sighs] Oh, yes, but, uh, it's usually better if someone else does it. I've had a few... accidents.==================================================================""Bowfinger"" is a much better movie than ""Chubby Rain"" the film-within-a-film--but that's not saying much, because ""Chubby Rain"" makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" look like ""Citizen Kane."" But it is almost as much fun watching them make it as the cast and crew had at the premiere.Eddie Murphy accepted the role because he wanted to work with Steve Martin, and both are very talented comedians, though they've both been much funnier elsewhere. Heather Graham is great as the ing&eacute;nue, Daisy; and Christine Baranski is always great, but I've seen her be much funnier elsewhere. Robert Downey Jr. is also in it, in a small but pivotal part.Directed by Frank Oz, who mostly works with The Muppets, though he also goes way back with Steve Martin, ""Bowfinger"" is no ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" but it takes its premise to the limit with lots of laughs along the way.Dirty Rotten Scoundrels(1988) ....

Commentaries by the other actors in the film and by Frank Oz all referred  to Murphy's uncanny ability to slip in and out of character at the blink of  an eye, and to his wonderful extrapolation of a character scripted to be  simple and naive.  Much of the humor in the film is subtle, based more on  the reactions of the characters to situations or comments than on any  actual dialogue or action.

Steve Martin plays the director, the titular Bowfinger (he also wrote the screenplay).  Eddie Murphy is the star, Kit.  Both are well suited to play their roles, and their performances are very good, especially Murphy in his second role as the star's less-famous (and less ambitious, less good-looking, less successful, etc.) brother.  Kit is in therapy for paranoia, and the strange people following him around, telling him things that make no sense (because it's dialogue for Bowfinger's film) don't help.  These scenes are the highlights for me, where Murphy gets a &quot;deer in headlights&quot; look and runs off to his therapist yet again.  The film works both as a satire and as slapstick comedy, and I was entertained from beginning to end.The performances are very good.  Martin and Terrance Stamp (the therapist) are always good, but I was pleasantly surprised by Murphy and Heather Graham (as one of the &quot;actors&quot; in the movie).  Murphy is much more likeable than usual (probably because he's parodying himself somewhat), and Graham puts in a good performance, much better than I thought her capable of. Christine Baranski is also memorable as another of the actors recruited by Bowfinger.The DVD edition does not stand out.  There are the typical extras, such as a director's commentary from Frank Oz (okay, but I can't help thinking Steve Martin should have been there too), (only) two cut scenes, and a short making-of piece.  Overall, not much added on the DVD relative to the tape.Although I enjoyed the movie and found it entertaining, it's not the type of movie I'd want to see over and over again.  Add in the fact that the DVD had few extras, I give it a 3/5.

I found it very amusing to watch Steve Martin make the most out of the limited resources he was working with -- including an office that looked like a fixer-upper on its way to demolition, and his trusty old dog.I watched this film immediately following THE MUSIC MAN, and was amazed that not only was The Music Man mentioned in BOWFINGER, but there are strong similarities between these two movies!  The most striking one is that the main character in BOWFINGER, played by Steve Martin, is doing his best to earn his living by doing something he feels uneasy and a bit dishonest about .  Another similarity is the focus on ""the big break"" which comes in the form of the Wells Fargo wagon delivering wonderful packages in The Music Man, and in the guise of the Fed Ex truck bringing good news for movie deals in Bowfinger.  The third big similarity is that both movies end with the main character realizing that what he has been doing actually does work -- and he's not the fraud that he suspected he might be.  I find this to be a very heartening message for all of us who have ever wondered if we had what it took to be a success.BOWFINGER is witty, thought-provoking, and ultimately uplifting -- and the cast is superb!

70949,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,0783241607,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[5, 5]","Whats so great about this movie is that it relentlessly makes fun of itself and works every minute.  The film revolves around failed actor-producer-directed Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) as he tries to give his dead career a jump-start.  After reading a script for a sci-fi film entitled 'Chubby Rain' that was written by his accountant (and friend) Bowfinger decides that this is the next big hit.  He tries to get a famous producer to take it (Downey Jr.) and he's told (in sarcasm) that if he gets international action star Kit Ramsey (Murphey) to star then he'll take on the film.  Theres only one problem, and the problem is Kit Ramsey.  Kit is one of my favorite comedic characters, mostly because he's so obsesive compulsive and downright paranoid that everything he says and does is histerical.  Kit believes that aliens, amoung other things, are coming to get him (and he has this obsession with the Laker's cheerleaders).  That's important to the comedy in the film because, while it's a little thing, it plays big on laughs.  You see, when Kit turns down the film Bowfinger decides, instead of telling his cast that the film won't happen, he tells them that Kit signed on, but that he doesn't want to talk to anyone about the film, he doesn't want to see the camera during the shoot, and they only get one take with Kit so they better put in all they have.  In other words, he decides to film Kit without Kit knowing it.  This results in Kit believing aliens are really following him and he resorts to hiding out in the 'MindHead' facility (a spoof on the ever popular scientoligy or 'Tom-Cruise-Syndrome')  Without his star he has no picture and so Bowfinger shops around for a look-alike, and he finds him in Jiff (Murphey).  Jiff is shy, Jiff is eager...but Jiff is stupid and so that makes filming with him a feat in itself.

I happen to find Steve Martin's brand of humor quirky, witty and deliriously off the wall.  This film is probably an example of his comedy at its best.  Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is part con artist/part trashy film visionary.  Yes, you could compare his calibre of genius to Ed Wood, who prided himself in making ""the worst film of all time,"" the wonderfully campy PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE.  Bowfinger's vision of CHUBBY RAIN, an alien film, is no different from the low budget B movies that Wood prided himself on churning out.  In this case, Bowfinger is fixated on a certain movie star, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), playing in the film.  Since there is no chance of his ever agreeing to appear in it, Bowfinger's crew must film Kit without him knowing it, while the cast recites their lines at the unsuspecting (and rather paranoid) celebrity.  What's more, Kit's ""stand in"" is played by a really geeky guy nothing remotely like the arrogant star (also played by Eddie Murphy).Frank Oz brilliantly directed this over-the-top fantasy of celebritydom.  The cast is terrrific, the concept is delightfully absurd, and Steve Martin truly had me wondering just what PLANET his character came from.

After years of tackling serious and semi-comic roles (LEAP OF FAITH) BOWFINGER sees Martin returning to his roots in a delightful farce about the film industry. The film also shows why Steve Martin is a class act in a business with few scruples. Martin could have ventured into Martin Lawrence territory by turning the film into a his own vehicle. After nearly three decades of hilarity, if there's anybody who deserves a self-tribute, it would be Steve Martin. But rather than have the script revolve around himself, Martin shares the screen with his co-star. In BOWFINGER, Martin's role is understated and his incompetent but determined Ed Wood-like would-be Hollywood director captures the sympathy of the viewer.It is Eddie Murphy however, once again playing multiple characters, who is allowed to steal the show. Proving that he's back to form after the mundane LIFE and the juvenile NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS, Murphy is characteristically edgy and over the top and gets the choicest lines. Playing a paranoid film star and his nerdy twin brother, Murphy steals almost every scene he's in. And Martin and Murphy are perhaps the funniest comic collaboration since Belushi and Ackroyd in THE BLUES BROTHERS. Here's hoping that they work together more in the future! The supporting cast is also allowed to shine. Heather Graham is hilarious as the stereotypical Hollywood starlet who feels obligated to sleep her way to the top. The beautiful Christine Baranski plays the competent but aging Carol, desperate for that one role but also determined to meet the ""star"" of Bowfingers new film. The film manages to be understated but never flat. In conclusion, BOWFINGER is a classic comedy.

Steve Martin wrote and stars in this improbable story of a director who attempts to make a movie around a  superstar actor who doesn't know he is in it.  The director, Bobby  Bowfinger (Martin) creates scenes and plays them out with the unwitting Kit  Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) on the streets of Hollywood with cameras  rolling.Basically the script was narcissistic with Martin writing  himself a ticket to play a character only he could play.  Ironically,  though this was more or less the Steve Martin show, Eddie Murphy stole the  entire movie.  Once again, Murphy plays two completely divergent  characters; superstar Kit Ramsey and his nerdy brother Jiff.  While Martin  attempts to be funny by playing someone absurd trying to be serious, Murphy  plays one over the edge paranoid ego maniac and a self conscious geek and  gets the majority of the laughs.  Give Steve Martin credit for having the  guts to bring in talent that could overshadow him.Frank Oz does a good  job of making filmmaking look like what we think it must be like and  nothing like what it really is.  I think most people think filmmaking is  like filming the news; you go in take some shots and leave.  The reality is  that 90% of shooting a movie is setup, lighting, marks, stunt coordination,  etc., to say nothing of post production.  The actual filming is the  smallest element of the project.Heather Graham makes great window  dressing as the naive Ohio girl ambitious to become a movie starlet, having  sex with anyone and everyone she thinks might help her career.  Her unusual  combination of sweetness, sexiness and gawkishness made her the perfect  choice for her character.I gave this movie a 6/10.

Scenes not to be missed:  The Recuitment Drive and The Finale.

70985,A3OH101U0CPUC7,0783241607,Joseph Boone,"[2, 2]","Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is a 49 year old combination has-been / wannabe film director.  In desperation, he hatches a scheme to shoot a movie using action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) without Kit knowing that he's in the film.  Using a Candid Camera style of filming, he sends his actors at Kit with their lines prepared and films the result.  It's silly and bizarre, and it also plays into an existing paranoia that Ramsey happens to have which greatly adds to his reaction as they film.  Bowfinger uses borrowed equipment and a virtually non-existent budget as he races to finish the film before he's discovered and/or he runs out of money.This is not the kind of movie one watches for thinking deep thoughts, but there are a few moments that are genuinely hilarious and most of the rest is amusing enough to be endearing.  One scene involving Eddie Murphy running across the freeway is especially funny and justifies watching the whole movie.  Murphy plays two parts in the film, Kit Ramsey, the paranoid egomaniac star and his brother Jiff, a dorky go-fer.  He's especially funny as Jiff and clearly relishes the part.  Steve Martin brings a fairly understated approach to his role as the puppet master trying to orchestrate the film and it works very well.  Heather Graham somehow manages to pull off being a small-town nave girl who simultaneously sleeps her way to the top with stunning rapidity.Bowfinger is probably not the funniest comedy you'll ever see, but it has a few great scenes and the balance of the film is reasonably entertaining.  The basic story resemblesEd Wood (Special Edition)in many respects, but is presented in a much more accessible and mainstream manner.  It's silly fun that requires its audience to sit back, switch off the brain, and enjoy the ride.

The only problem is he has almost no money and no one will work with him.The plot is to film the movie starring Ramsey without him knowing he's being filmed. Somewhat original.They bring in actors to surprise Ramsey while he's out doing his normal everyday things in order to create the illusion that it's just a film.When Ramsey disappears the film crew find a close look-a-like to play his closeups.This movie felt like every other Frank Oz movie (see Dirty Rotten Scoundrels). There are moments when it was pretty funny and most times it was grin-and-bear it.I no longer wonder why it took so long for me to watch this movie.

70998,A152C8GYY25HAH,0783241607,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","It is widely believed that a good comedy is hard to create and that a great one is almost impossible to make. Judging by most of what has been produced in the last decade or so, that may be true. I know, however, that it wasn't always true. From the 1930s through the 1970s, Hollywood released a number of funny movies every year. I don't know what caused the laughter to die down. All I can tell you is that, when a good comedy comes along, you ought to take the opportunity to see it, since it may be months until the next one. Bowfinger is such a movie.Steve Martin, who also wrote the script, is Bobby Bowfinger, the least successful producer in Tinseltown. He gets a screenplay he thinks is great, but how is he going to finance any project? A studio executive tells him jokingly that if he can get Kitt Ramsey [Eddy Murphy] to play the lead, the studio will finance the movie. Bowfinger takes the offer seriously. When Ramsey throws him out of his limo, Bowfinger is down but not out. He hatches a scheme. Suppose he and his motley crew were to sneak around and film Ramsey secretly? What if Ramsey were to star in a movie and not even know it? Only in Hollywood, I hear you saying.What follows is an antidote to the cynical, sophomoric or gross-out comedies that have been so prevalent these days. Frankly, some of these were amusing, but Bowfinger is a return to a gentler form of satire. People are made fun of, but there is no meanness to the humor. Bowfinger may be an Everyman in a world of wolves, but he is a well-adjusted one. He always has a plan. The ending proved to be a little too simplistic and upbeat for my tastes, but it does little to ruin the fun.This is Steve Martin's best comedy work since LA Story in 1991, but it is Eddy Murphy who easily takes the acting honors. He plays both Kitt Ramsey and another character named Jiff. We know Murphy can make people laugh, but as an actor, he in underrated. Bowfinger hires Jiff because he looks so much like Ramsey. Murphy gives them each a unique personality. Ramsey is hyper and totally paranoid, while Jiff is nerdy and not very fast. Each has a different body language, and it is part of Murphy's genius that he can create two characters so physically similar yet different at the same time.Heather Graham is, as Jiff puts it, awesome. Hers is the role of Daisy, an actress fresh off the bus from Ohio who will sleep with anyone to get what she wants. Graham gives her character a hysterical combination of worldliness and sweetness. Also great is Christine Baraski, of Now and Again, who plays an aging actress who never once acknowledges that her career is on the skids.If I have any problem with Bowfinger, it is due to director Frank Oz. Many movies today are so long. I looked in the newspaper the other day, and nearly everything playing ran from two to three hours. It's as though studios, which are now run by accountants, accept whatever cut the director hands them these days. Oz has the opposite problem. He cuts his movies to the bone. As a result, there are a couple of spots in Bowfinger where it seems like something has been omitted.",4,"Sharp, funny satire of Hollywood",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,3124,"['widely', 'believed', 'good', 'comedy', 'hard', 'create', 'great', 'one', 'almost', 'impossible', 'make', 'Judging', 'most', 'been', 'produced', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'know', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'true', '1930s', '1970s', 'Hollywood', 'released', 'number', 'funny', 'movies', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'caused', 'laughter', 'die', 'down', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'good', 'comedy', 'along', 'ought', 'take', 'opportunity', 'see', 'may', 'be', 'months', 'next', 'one', 'Bowfinger', 'such', 'movie.Steve', 'Martin', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'least', 'successful', 'producer', 'Tinseltown', 'screenplay', 'great', 'how', 'going', 'finance', 'project', 'studio', 'executive', 'jokingly', 'can', 'get', 'Kitt', 'Ramsey', '[', 'Eddy', 'Murphy', ']', 'play', 'lead', 'studio', 'will', 'finance', 'movie', 'Bowfinger', 'offer', 'seriously', 'When', 'Ramsey', 'limo', 'Bowfinger', 'down', 'not', 'out', 'scheme', 'motley', 'crew', 'were', 'sneak', 'film', 'Ramsey', 'secretly', 'What', 'Ramsey', 'were', 'star', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'Only', 'Hollywood', 'hear', 'saying.What', 'antidote', 'cynical', 'sophomoric', 'gross-out', 'comedies', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'prevalent', 'days', 'Frankly', 'were', 'amusing', 'Bowfinger', 'return', 'gentler', 'form', 'satire', 'People', 'are', 'made', 'fun', 'meanness', 'humor', 'Bowfinger', 'may', 'be', 'Everyman', 'world', 'wolves', 'well-adjusted', 'one', 'always', 'plan', 'ending', 'proved', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'simplistic', 'upbeat', 'tastes', 'little', 'ruin', 'fun.This', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'best', 'comedy', 'work', 'LA', 'Story', '1991', 'Eddy', 'Murphy', 'who', 'easily', 'acting', 'honors', 'Kitt', 'Ramsey', 'character', 'named', 'Jiff', 'know', 'Murphy', 'can', 'make', 'people', 'actor', 'underrated', 'Bowfinger', 'Jiff', 'so', 'much', 'Ramsey', 'Murphy', 'unique', 'personality', 'Ramsey', 'hyper', 'totally', 'paranoid', 'Jiff', 'nerdy', 'not', 'very', 'fast', 'different', 'body', 'language', 'part', 'Murphy', 'genius', 'can', 'create', 'two', 'characters', 'so', 'physically', 'similar', 'yet', 'different', 'same', 'time.Heather', 'Graham', 'Jiff', 'awesome', 'Hers', 'role', 'Daisy', 'actress', 'fresh', 'off', 'bus', 'Ohio', 'who', 'will', 'sleep', 'anyone', 'get', 'what', 'Graham', 'character', 'hysterical', 'combination', 'worldliness', 'sweetness', 'Also', 'great', 'Christine', 'Baraski', 'Now', 'Again', 'who', 'aging', 'actress', 'who', 'never', 'once', 'career', 'skids.If', 'have', 'problem', 'Bowfinger', 'due', 'director', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'Many', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'so', 'long', 'looked', 'newspaper', 'other', 'day', 'nearly', 'everything', 'playing', 'ran', 'two', 'three', 'hours', 'studios', 'are', 'now', 'run', 'accountants', 'accept', 'cut', 'director', 'days', 'Oz', 'opposite', 'problem', 'movies', 'bone', 'result', 'are', 'couple', 'spots', 'Bowfinger', 'where', 'something', 'been', 'omitted']",N/A

71009,A3QVAKVRAH657N,0783241607,"Orrin C. Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[34, 37]","What lifts this film up and makes it not just funny but great is that lurking behind the facade of a light-hearted slapstick about movie-making is a fairly devastating satire of Hollywood and its denizens. So on the surface you've got Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), B-movie producer/director, using his last $2000 to make the film, Chubby Rain, from a script by his earnest Muslim accountant. Promised major studio backing if he can just secure the services of action-film superstar, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), but realizing he's got no chance of doing so, Bowfinger decides to just surreptitiously include Kit in the movie. This leads to some hilarious guerilla filmmaking, in which the other characters from Chubby Rain, to whom Bowfinger has not explained what's really going on, run up and interact with an increasingly bewildered and terrified Ramsey. As we soon learn, Kit's frantic reaction to the dialogue and special effects of Bowfinger's invading-space-aliens film is exacerbated by some significant prior mental problems, which include an obsession with exposing himself to the Laker girls.Also assisting in the production of the film are : a devious studio prop man, who steals everything from cars to cameras for Bowfinger; a seemingly fresh-scrubbed country girl, Daisy (Heather Graham); a serious, but bad, professional actress (Christine Baranski); Kit's twin, but excessively geeky, brother, Jiff (also played by Eddie Murphy); a gaggle of illegal Mexicans, picked up at the border; and even Bowfinger's multi-talented dog. All add to the mayhem in their own ways.But meanwhile, Kit turns out to be a member of a cult called Mind Head, led by Terrence Stamp in a funny turn, which bears an uncanny resemblance to Scientology. Heather Graham's supposedly innocent character sleeps her way through the entire Bowfinger operation, whoring for more lines and a bigger role. In the final scene of the movie she even turns up with a lesbian girlfriend, who just happens to be a major Hollywood player, summoning memories of Steve Martin's own relationship with a pre-Ellen Anne Heche. And Graham's entire role appears to be an implicit critique of her own career which seems to be likewise based almost exclusively on her breasts. Kit Ramsey's claims of racism in the industry are made fun of as he at one point adds up the ""k's"" in a movie script and divides by three to show his agent how often ""KKK"" appears. Several other ostensibly good-natured bits that we can see on further examination have an edge to them include a scene where Bowfinger gets Jiff to run across a busy thruway by telling him that the cars are driven by stunt men, but which also shows how little he cares about the actor's safety, and a conversation where Jiff asks wonderingly why someone's willing to pay him just for looking like someone else, raises inevitable questions about an industry where mere physical appearance can mean millions. In fact, the whole conceit of the story, that you could basically make a successful action flick without the big-salaried star knowing he'd been in the movie, and that everyone in the movie business is just using everyone else, is a pretty tough commentary on the current state of Hollywood.This harsher undercurrent gives the movie a nasty, though subtle, edge that I really liked, but which some critics found off-putting. Much of the potential tension is defused by Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy who give tremendous performances, Murphy in the seemingly tougher dual role, and Martin in the actually more difficult balancing act of making Bobby Bowfinger likable even as he cheats, lies to, and steals from everyone in sight. The end result is a picture that works on two levels, one of mostly broad physical comedy, the other darker and more satirical. Comedy is hard enough to get right, but to nail it above and below the surface is an exceedingly rare achievement; that it manages this unusual fate makes Bowfinger one of the best comedies of the '90s and vastly underrrated.GRADE : A",5,underrated,1028592000,"08 6, 2002",2002,4023,"['What', 'film', 'up', 'not', 'just', 'funny', 'great', 'lurking', 'facade', 'light-hearted', 'slapstick', 'movie-making', 'fairly', 'devastating', 'satire', 'Hollywood', 'denizens', 'So', 'surface', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'B-movie', 'producer/director', 'using', 'last', '2000', 'make', 'film', 'Chubby', 'Rain', 'script', 'earnest', 'Muslim', 'accountant', 'Promised', 'major', 'studio', 'backing', 'can', 'just', 'secure', 'services', 'action-film', 'superstar', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'realizing', 'got', 'chance', 'doing', 'so', 'Bowfinger', 'just', 'surreptitiously', 'include', 'Kit', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'guerilla', 'filmmaking', 'other', 'characters', 'Chubby', 'Rain', 'whom', 'Bowfinger', 'not', 'explained', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'run', 'up', 'interact', 'increasingly', 'bewildered', 'terrified', 'Ramsey', 'soon', 'learn', 'Kit', 'frantic', 'reaction', 'dialogue', 'special', 'effects', 'Bowfinger', 'invading-space-aliens', 'film', 'exacerbated', 'significant', 'prior', 'mental', 'problems', 'include', 'obsession', 'exposing', 'Laker', 'girls.Also', 'assisting', 'production', 'film', 'are', 'devious', 'studio', 'prop', 'man', 'who', 'steals', 'everything', 'cars', 'cameras', 'Bowfinger', 'seemingly', 'fresh-scrubbed', 'country', 'girl', 'Daisy', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'serious', 'bad', 'professional', 'actress', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'Kit', 'twin', 'excessively', 'geeky', 'brother', 'Jiff', 'also', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'gaggle', 'illegal', 'Mexicans', 'picked', 'up', 'border', 'even', 'Bowfinger', 'multi-talented', 'dog', 'add', 'mayhem', 'own', 'ways.But', 'meanwhile', 'Kit', 'out', 'be', 'member', 'cult', 'called', 'Mind', 'Head', 'led', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'funny', 'turn', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'Scientology', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'supposedly', 'innocent', 'character', 'sleeps', 'way', 'entire', 'Bowfinger', 'operation', 'whoring', 'more', 'lines', 'bigger', 'role', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'even', 'up', 'lesbian', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'player', 'summoning', 'memories', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'own', 'relationship', 'pre-Ellen', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Graham', 'entire', 'role', 'be', 'implicit', 'critique', 'own', 'career', 'be', 'likewise', 'based', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'breasts', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'claims', 'racism', 'industry', 'are', 'made', 'fun', 'one', 'point', 'up', 'k', 'movie', 'script', 'divides', 'three', 'show', 'agent', 'how', 'often', 'KKK', 'Several', 'other', 'ostensibly', 'good-natured', 'bits', 'can', 'see', 'further', 'examination', 'have', 'edge', 'include', 'scene', 'where', 'Bowfinger', 'Jiff', 'run', 'busy', 'thruway', 'telling', 'cars', 'are', 'driven', 'stunt', 'men', 'also', 'how', 'little', 'actor', 'safety', 'conversation', 'where', 'Jiff', 'wonderingly', 'why', 'someone', 'willing', 'pay', 'just', 'looking', 'someone', 'else', 'inevitable', 'questions', 'industry', 'where', 'mere', 'physical', 'appearance', 'can', 'mean', 'millions', 'fact', 'whole', 'conceit', 'story', 'could', 'basically', 'make', 'successful', 'action', 'flick', 'big-salaried', 'star', 'knowing', ""'d"", 'been', 'movie', 'everyone', 'movie', 'business', 'just', 'using', 'everyone', 'else', 'pretty', 'tough', 'commentary', 'current', 'state', 'Hollywood.This', 'undercurrent', 'movie', 'nasty', 'though', 'subtle', 'edge', 'really', 'liked', 'critics', 'found', 'off-putting', 'Much', 'potential', 'tension', 'defused', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'who', 'give', 'tremendous', 'performances', 'Murphy', 'seemingly', 'tougher', 'dual', 'role', 'Martin', 'actually', 'more', 'difficult', 'balancing', 'act', 'making', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'likable', 'even', 'steals', 'everyone', 'sight', 'end', 'result', 'picture', 'two', 'levels', 'one', 'mostly', 'broad', 'physical', 'comedy', 'other', 'darker', 'more', 'satirical', 'Comedy', 'hard', 'enough', 'get', 'right', 'nail', 'surface', 'exceedingly', 'rare', 'achievement', 'unusual', 'fate', 'Bowfinger', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', ""'90s"", 'vastly', 'underrrated.GRADE']",N/A

One day, he receives a script from his desperate-to-be-in-film accountant and part-time receptionist, Afrim (Adam Alexi-Malle), titled &quot;Chubby Rain.&quot; Bowfinger, being the con he is, though, has no pull in Hollywood, despite his presentation to his desperate cast and crew, and is forced to try and con the top producer in Hollywood (Robert Downey Jr.) to give him studio backing. The producer sees through his con rather easily, and tells him that he has a &quot;go picture&quot; if he can get Kit Ramsey(Eddie Murphy), the most popular (and most paranoid) action star of the present, to be the leading man. This set up is ingenius, thanks to the script by Martin.However, what ensues is an erratic pace of hilarity and slowness. Instead of an even comedy, hard laughs, and moments of awkwardness alternate as to almost give you some sort of emotional whiplash. Fortunately, there are more big laughs than awkward moments, and the ends for the most part justify the means. Frank Oz does a fair job as director, but it really is the acting that carries the movie-and you don't have to be a big Eddie Murphy fan to appreciate his work. Murphy's role as Kit Ramsey is a typecast Murphy role-loud, short-fused, obnoxious-but he is almost lampooning his earlier roles. His other role as Jiff, Kit Ramsey's gentle, nave body double, is much better. Perhaps the stark contrast between Jiff and Kit's characters make Jiff's more incredible. Martin's Bobby Bowfinger character is also a common Steve Martin character: he is an affable con man whom you grow to understand and like by the end of the movie (see &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;).  This time, though, he's gotten better at being a little more real and less wild and crazy. As far as the supporting cast, Heather Graham is fine as the Iowan starlet Daisy, but Christine Baranski-who plays Carol, an older actress who behaves like a Hollywood legend even though nobody knows who she is-and Alexi-Malle are great in their scenes. Terence Stamp(&quot;Star Wars-The Phantom Menace&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;), as a psychologist at a pyramid-loving, Scientology institute, also gives a strong performance.As stated previously, there are some problems: it starts out weakly, and there are some gags that don't quite work. However, the big laughs are enough to give the movie three stars.

71012,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0783241607,Reviewer,"[4, 7]","Steve Martin stars as independent movie-maker Bobby Bowfinger in ""Bowfinger,"" a satirical look at what it takes to get a movie made in Hollywood.  When a terrific script (involving aliens) lands in his hands,  Bowfinger finagles a green light from producer Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey  Jr.), with one condition:  action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) must be  attached to the project.  Ecstatic, Bowfinger goes to work; he hires a cast  and crew and everything is in place, except that Kit Ramsey will have  nothing to do with him.  Not to worry; Bowfinger convinces the others  involved that Ramsey is aboard, but the scenes with their star will have to  be shot, well, without the star actually being there.  Written by  Steve Martin and directed by Frank Oz, ""Bowfinger"" is funny and  entertaining.  Murphy has one of his best outings in years in the dual role  of Ramsey and ""Jiff,""  the hapless double Bowfinger gets to stand in for  his star for the action sequences.  Heather Graham is Daisy, a young  actress literally just off the bus from the Midwest who is hired by  Bowfinger for a small part in his movie.  Daisy, however, we soon learn is  anything but ""just off the bus,"" as she comically employs the traditional  Hollywood behind-the-scenes politics to convert her bit part into a lead  role.  Christine Baranski is Carol, the lead actress who rationalizes her  way through Bowfinger's ridiculous explanations of why she is doing scenes  without the participation of the lead actor; and Steve Martin shines as the  opportunistic Bowfinger.  With an able supporting cast that includes  Barry Newman (Kit's agent), Terence Stamp (Terry), Jamie Kennedy (Dave) and  Adam Alexi-Malle (Afrim), ""Bowfinger"" stays right on track and offers some  memorable moments, including a running parody of Scientology, and an  especially hilarious scene in which Jiff negotiates traffic while  attempting to cross a busy freeway on foot. When Martin and Murphy are ""on""  and have good material to work with, they can make you laugh; in this film,  they succeed.",3,Martin and Murphy Deliver,955324800,"04 10, 2000",2000,2058,"['Steve', 'Martin', 'independent', 'movie-maker', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'Bowfinger', 'satirical', 'look', 'what', 'get', 'movie', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'When', 'terrific', 'script', 'involving', 'aliens', 'hands', 'Bowfinger', 'green', 'light', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Renfro', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'one', 'condition', 'action', 'star', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'must', 'be', 'attached', 'project', 'Ecstatic', 'Bowfinger', 'work', 'cast', 'crew', 'everything', 'place', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Not', 'worry', 'Bowfinger', 'others', 'involved', 'Ramsey', 'aboard', 'scenes', 'star', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'shot', 'well', 'star', 'actually', 'being', 'there', 'Written', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'Bowfinger', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'Murphy', 'one', 'best', 'outings', 'years', 'dual', 'role', 'Ramsey', 'Jiff', 'hapless', 'double', 'Bowfinger', 'stand', 'star', 'action', 'sequences', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Daisy', 'young', 'actress', 'literally', 'just', 'bus', 'Midwest', 'who', 'hired', 'Bowfinger', 'small', 'part', 'movie', 'Daisy', 'however', 'soon', 'learn', 'anything', 'just', 'bus', 'comically', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'behind-the-scenes', 'politics', 'convert', 'bit', 'part', 'lead', 'role', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'Carol', 'lead', 'actress', 'who', 'way', 'Bowfinger', 'ridiculous', 'explanations', 'why', 'doing', 'scenes', 'participation', 'lead', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'shines', 'opportunistic', 'Bowfinger', 'able', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Barry', 'Newman', 'Kit', 'agent', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Terry', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'Dave', 'Adam', 'Alexi-Malle', 'Afrim', 'Bowfinger', 'right', 'track', 'memorable', 'moments', 'including', 'running', 'parody', 'Scientology', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Jiff', 'traffic', 'attempting', 'cross', 'busy', 'freeway', 'foot', 'When', 'Martin', 'Murphy', 'are', 'have', 'good', 'material', 'work', 'can', 'make', 'laugh', 'film', 'succeed']",N/A

71014,A361LE16VBQDP8,0783241607,Robert Bezimienny,"[0, 0]","One of the funniest aspects of this DVD is the commentary by Frank Oz - initially I thought he was hamming it up, pretending to be clueless, deliberately providing inane comments and banal 'insights', but, regrettably, no ham was involved. This guy is earnest, and he takes comedy seriously (hey, he took The Muppets so seriously that he's made himself look like one of them (eat your heart out Robert De Niro)); he's dishonest (or blind) about even his own motivations (listen to him during the Heather Graham/Steve Martin bedroom scene and wince); there seems to be some kind of mutual admiration thing on between him and Steve Martin, and this compounds the problem, because Steve takes comedy extremely seriously too - it's hard work, and its aim appears to be making money and making Steve look clever and, at one level, likeable - trying to be likeable is intrinsically not funny. You end up being about as funny as Tom Hanks. Which brings us to Eddie Murphy, who is absolutely hilarious. He saves the film. He's that good. Most of the great laughs are provided by Eddie ad-libbing (Frank Oz unwittingly, and rather self-defeatingly, reveals this). Why isn't there more of Eddie? Well, it gets back to Frank Oz and Steve Martin - they're trying to do a movie by the numbers, Hollywood 'formula' comedy that would get a tick from script doctors like Robert McKee, so they better spend that time sending those irrelevant minor characters 'on a journey', babbling on about the 'underlying message' of the film (really, I'm not making this up, it's on the commentary) about 'following your dream'.

71016,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0783241607,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Though not a comic jewel on a par with his 1991 &quot;LA Story,&quot; Steve Martin's latest comedy, &quot;Bowfinger,&quot; stands as an inventive, high-spirited, occasionally silly, but often hilarious take on  the trials and tribulations encountered in the over-saturated world of low  budget filmmaking.Martin stars as Bowfinger, a down-on-his-luck wannabe  head of a movie production company that brings new meaning to the term  &quot;shoestring.&quot; With an equally ragtag band of idealists as his  crew, this quixotic visionary hits upon an absurd scheme to bring his  godawful action film script to fruition; after it is handily rejected by  Kit Ramsey, one of the hottest action stars in the business, Bowfinger  concocts a scheme to film his screenplay AROUND the actor, plotting the  man's every move, following him around town, and instructing his own  amateur actors (who are oblivious to Ramsey's obliviousness) to jump out  and act out their parts for the hidden cameras before an increasingly  startled and distraught Ramsey. This clever setup generates a considerable  wave of comic energy that propels the story forward even though, like most  films that rely heavily on a one-joke premise, the film does suffer a bit  from the diminishing returns of repetition. However, Martin's creative  skills as a writer keep the idea fresh for most of the film's running  time.The film is blessed with an absolutely smashing comic performance  by Eddie Murphy, who brings just the right note of both arrogance and  anxiety to his portrait of a superstar whose internal insecurities and  paranoia are hidden beneath a veneer of arrant egotism and aggressive  despotism. Murphy is less successful with his other role, that of a shy  nerdish Ramsey look alike (he actually turns out to be Ramsey's brother)  whom the crew is compelled to use as a stand in for the real star when the  latter is driven to seek a rest cure to soothe his frazzled nerves, caused,  ironically, by Bowfinger's own antics. In all fairness to Murphy, however,  in the character of Jiff, the actor has been given no solid center from  which to build an effective comic performance. As a writer,Martin has  failed to really develop Jiff's purpose in the proceedings and the  character seems tacked on mostly to give Murphy a chance to indulge in some  weak displays of slack jawed buffoonery.Where the film does triumph is  in the constant inventivenss of the situations, particularly the clever way  in which Ramsey's paranoia dovetails so nicely with the absurdity swirling  around him. Martin has also cast a company of first-rate performers as the  sharply delineated secondary characters who make up Bowfinger's  never-say-die team. Particularly wonderful are Heather Graham, whose  character stumbles off a bus a naive young kid from Ohio, idealistically in  search of quick stardom, who quickly learns to use her feminine wiles to  enhance her starmaking opportunities, and Christine Baranski, whose  over-the-hill and over-the-top method actress, determined come hell or high  water to make an impression on the blithely unaware Ramsey, provides many  of the genuine belly laughs in the film.&quot;Bowfinger&quot; lacks the  keen societal and psychological insights of Martin's greatest film,  &quot;LA Story,&quot; since it does tend to flail satirically at more  obvious and less universal targets.

This movie parodies Hollywood and does a masterful job.Martin is a genious whose screenwriting and novels deserve higher acclaim.  While he works in the industry it's obvious he doesn't take himself too seriously. And really, who could, if they had played &quot;The Jerk&quot; in their career.Martin plays a down on his luck producer/director whose only real connection to Hollywood is he lives in the same city. He has a small project he can't get made. Since he's embarrassed to tell his crew, Martin tells them instead that the biggest star in Hollywood has agreed to be in the movie but wants to act without talking to anyone, another parody of quirks which actors ask for and receive.  The &quot;big&quot; star is played brillantly by Eddie Murphy.  Eddie Murphy has been portrayed in the press as aloof and cocky.  If so, I can't see why he would agree to make such  a movie spoofing himself.  Irrespective, he plays cocky like the Eddie Murphy we know and as a &quot;lookalike&quot; gofer, he plays &quot;Goofy&quot; through the roof.  I'm really surprised there wasn't more press about this acting job.Needless to say all the cliches are there, a parody of the pretty new actress who will sleep with anyone, Eddie Murphy's &quot;star&quot; lifestyle, and his one hidden weakness which certainly plays close to Murphy's real life legal problem.This is a very funny movie, particularly if you like Hollywood.

This movie  is about the down and out 'movie producer' Bobby Bowfinger (played by Steve  Martin), who's basically a con artist covering up with his smooth-talking.

But when Kit refuses, and Bobby tells his other stars that  Kit is going to be in it, the only other solution is filming the movie with  Kit, except he doesn't know they're filming it.  This premise ends up with  hilarious results! And the way it makes fun of all things Hollywood  (Heather Grahmn stars as Daisy, a girl who'll sleep with anyone to become a  star and then becomes a lesbian, which is making fun of Anne Heche who  slept with Steve to become famous and then went out with Ellen DeGeneres)  makes you want to laugh as much as the story does.

71023,ANHGGQT4HTEK0,0783241607,Sonia,"[3, 3]","I hardly know where to begin.  This movie is completely nuts.  It's insane.  It is so absolutely wacky that you have one of two choices: laugh hysterically or try too hard to be rational and end up annoyed.Bowfinger was written by Steve Martin.  He also stars as the title character, Bobby Bowfinger, a down-and-out movie producer in present day Hollywood.  If you don't know who Steve Martin is, chances are you don't get out much.  If you do know who he is and are familiar with his work, this is the typical Steve Martin comedy stuffed to the gills with wacky, deranged zaniness.The premise is simple enough, if you allow yourself to roll with the punches.  Bobby Bowfinger has a script for an action movie written by his accountant.  The movie, preposterously named, Chubby Rain, is about alien invaders and  packed full of the alien action movie cliches we've all come to know and love.  Bowfinger has his band of loyal followers: the has-been diva (Christine Baranski), the young hunk, and a fresh-off-the-bus import from Ohio, named Daisy (Heather Graham), who has given herself one week to become a Hollywood star.  He also has a lackey named Dave who has a legitimate job on a studio lot and will steal, ahem, BORROW anything from the lot to get Bowfinger's movie made. The only thing missing from a blockbuster production of Chubby Rain is a big name star.  He tries to get action god Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to be a part of this movie the honest way (sorta) but finally decides to make the movie, with Kit Ramsey in it, without him knowing he's in it.  Trouble is, Bobby Bowfinger's devotees think Kit knows he's in the movie, but that he is such an artist, he doesn't want to see the camera, and he will only do a scene in one take, so they'd better get it right.As you can imagine, with so many misguided and basically confused individuals, the jokes are limitless.  But the really clever aspect of the movie is that it is one collosial joke on Hollywood and all its plastic mayhem.  Steve Martin has written every stereotype Hollywood persona, and every Hollywood cliche into the script of Bowfinger.While Bowfinger doesn't implement the good twin/evil twin formula, Kit Ramsey's dorky but endearing twin brother Jiff (also Eddie Murphy) is employed by Bobby Bowfinger to be a body double for the ""not really in the movie"" star.  Murphy has created a loveable buffon in the Jiff character, one the audience might find themselves rooting for and laughing at simultaneously.  While auditioning for the role as Kit's body double, Jiff is equally thrilled with the fact that Bowfinger will allow him to run errands during the production as well.  Bobby  Bowfinger also gives this glorified gopher the inspiration to run across a busy LA freeway, telling him its like an errand, and that all the drivers are professional stunt drivers.  The panicked look on Murphy's face while crossing the freeway...I can hardly type, it is too funny.Just when you thought things couldn't get any whackier, all the scenes being shot around Kit Ramsey's everyday life, only serve to feed an already present paranoia Ramsey has about strange people and alien possesion.  He has some other problems, which I don't want to spoil if you get the movie.But our hero has a constant support system in MindHead, a Church of Scientology  rip-off organization, where there are pyramid shaped hats members wear and one reaches enlightenment through a series of Happy Premises.  MindHead feeds on the insecurities of Hollywood stars and strokes their egos, allowing stays in the Celebrity Relaxing Quarters on the premises when necessary.Wacky script and cliches aside, the acting is a hoot.  This clan is a bunch of stereotyped, far-out characters who've managed to find a family.  In their own, twisted ways, they really just want to work hard, and fit in.  They will do anything they can to be movie stars.  Bobby Bowfinger pretends to have an important phone call in the presence of a big time Hollywood agent, neglecting to hide the cord on his supposed cell phone.  Daisy decides early on that she'll sleep her way to the top.  All Kit Ramsey really wants is a really cool catch-phrase, like Arnold and Clint have, convinced only white action heroes get the good lines.As if you haven't figured it out already, I think the movie is a scream.  Steve Martin has written a gem of a comedy, without the gross-out, body-part, ""can this really be happening"" humor that seems to be the standard of late.  Eddie Murphy is equally funny as both Ramsey twins, finding new and fresh ways to play paranoid and nerdish.  Comedy doesn't get the respect it deserves, but Bowfinger gets a healthy dose from me.",5,"I laughed, I cried....because I was laughing so hard",970358400,"10 1, 2000",2000,4682,"['hardly', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'movie', 'completely', 'nuts', 'insane', 'so', 'absolutely', 'wacky', 'have', 'one', 'two', 'choices', 'laugh', 'hysterically', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'rational', 'end', 'up', 'annoyed.Bowfinger', 'was', 'written', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'also', 'title', 'character', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'down-and-out', 'movie', 'producer', 'present', 'day', 'Hollywood', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'chances', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'much', 'do', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'work', 'typical', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'comedy', 'stuffed', 'gills', 'wacky', 'deranged', 'zaniness.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'enough', 'allow', 'roll', 'punches', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'script', 'action', 'movie', 'written', 'accountant', 'movie', 'preposterously', 'named', 'Chubby', 'Rain', 'alien', 'invaders', 'packed', 'full', 'alien', 'action', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'love', 'Bowfinger', 'band', 'loyal', 'followers', 'has-been', 'diva', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'young', 'hunk', 'fresh-off-the-bus', 'import', 'Ohio', 'named', 'Daisy', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'who', 'given', 'one', 'week', 'become', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'also', 'lackey', 'named', 'Dave', 'who', 'legitimate', 'job', 'studio', 'lot', 'will', 'steal', 'ahem', 'BORROW', 'anything', 'lot', 'get', 'Bowfinger', 'movie', 'made', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'blockbuster', 'production', 'Chubby', 'Rain', 'big', 'name', 'star', 'get', 'action', 'god', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'be', 'part', 'movie', 'honest', 'way', 'sorta', 'finally', 'make', 'movie', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'knowing', 'Trouble', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'devotees', 'think', 'Kit', 'movie', 'such', 'artist', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'camera', 'will', 'only', 'do', 'scene', 'one', 'take', ""'d"", 'better', 'get', 'right.As', 'can', 'imagine', 'so', 'many', 'misguided', 'basically', 'confused', 'individuals', 'jokes', 'are', 'limitless', 'really', 'clever', 'aspect', 'movie', 'one', 'collosial', 'joke', 'Hollywood', 'plastic', 'mayhem', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'written', 'stereotype', 'Hollywood', 'persona', 'Hollywood', 'cliche', 'script', 'Bowfinger.While', 'Bowfinger', ""n't"", 'implement', 'good', 'twin/evil', 'twin', 'formula', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'dorky', 'endearing', 'twin', 'brother', 'Jiff', 'also', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'employed', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'be', 'body', 'double', 'not', 'really', 'movie', 'star', 'Murphy', 'created', 'loveable', 'buffon', 'Jiff', 'character', 'one', 'audience', 'might', 'find', 'rooting', 'laughing', 'simultaneously', 'auditioning', 'role', 'Kit', 'body', 'double', 'Jiff', 'equally', 'thrilled', 'fact', 'Bowfinger', 'will', 'allow', 'run', 'errands', 'production', 'as', 'well', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'also', 'glorified', 'gopher', 'inspiration', 'run', 'busy', 'LA', 'freeway', 'telling', 'errand', 'drivers', 'are', 'professional', 'stunt', 'drivers', 'panicked', 'look', 'Murphy', 'face', 'crossing', 'freeway', 'can', 'hardly', 'type', 'too', 'funny.Just', 'when', 'thought', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'whackier', 'scenes', 'being', 'shot', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'everyday', 'life', 'only', 'serve', 'feed', 'already', 'present', 'paranoia', 'Ramsey', 'strange', 'people', 'alien', 'possesion', 'other', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'get', 'movie.But', 'hero', 'constant', 'support', 'system', 'MindHead', 'Church', 'Scientology', 'rip-off', 'organization', 'where', 'are', 'pyramid', 'shaped', 'hats', 'members', 'wear', 'one', 'reaches', 'enlightenment', 'series', 'Happy', 'Premises', 'MindHead', 'feeds', 'insecurities', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'strokes', 'egos', 'allowing', 'stays', 'Celebrity', 'Relaxing', 'Quarters', 'premises', 'when', 'necessary.Wacky', 'script', 'cliches', 'aside', 'acting', 'hoot', 'clan', 'bunch', 'stereotyped', 'far-out', 'characters', 'who', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'find', 'family', 'own', 'twisted', 'ways', 'really', 'just', 'want', 'work', 'hard', 'fit', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'movie', 'stars', 'Bobby', 'Bowfinger', 'have', 'important', 'phone', 'call', 'presence', 'big', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'neglecting', 'hide', 'cord', 'supposed', 'cell', 'phone', 'Daisy', 'early', ""'ll"", 'sleep', 'way', 'top', 'Kit', 'Ramsey', 'really', 'really', 'cool', 'catch-phrase', 'Arnold', 'Clint', 'have', 'convinced', 'only', 'white', 'action', 'heroes', 'get', 'good', 'lines.As', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'already', 'think', 'movie', 'scream', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'written', 'gem', 'comedy', 'gross-out', 'body-part', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'happening', 'humor', 'be', 'standard', 'late', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'equally', 'funny', 'Ramsey', 'twins', 'finding', 'new', 'fresh', 'ways', 'play', 'paranoid', 'nerdish', 'Comedy', ""n't"", 'get', 'respect', 'Bowfinger', 'healthy', 'dose']",N/A

The storyline was original and Eddie Murphy's multiple role technique was good but not like the nutty professor movies.

So how appropriate that Eddie and Steve's surnames should both share the same  first consonant, and also with that of magic, madness, majestic, mayhem and  magnificent! (get the idea?). Martin 'n' Murphy give one of the best  performances of their distinguished careers and work so well together.  Especially Martin who has been languishing on the side lines in recent  years, this is possibly his best film since his 1979 classic 'The Jerk'.  The film has one of the most original plots for a comedy from the decade,  and is done in exactly the style that you would expect from mixing the  talents of Steve and Eddie. It has the energy and blatant humour of a  Murphy film and eccentricity and thoughtfulness of a Martin movie. The  result? Complete madness!The mayhem starts when a small time, 'wannabe'  film maker, Bobby Bowfinger (played by Martin) is delivered a script about  aliens (by his accountant! ). Bowfinger loves it and believes it can be a  great success. He attempts to persuade one of Hollywood's stars, Kit Ramsey  (Murphy) to appear in the picture, but when the star turns him down the  film is in great danger of becoming yet another failed project. Not having  the heart to tell his crew that the film is off, Bobby decides to film the  movie with Kit Ramsey in anyway...without him knowing that he is in it and  the other actors and crew not knowing that he isn't! What follows is an  hilarious onslaught of comedy moments that I am sure will stand the test of  time and this film will be remembered as a true classic. Not just for the  plot but also because of the majestic performances given by the cast.  Murphy yet again plays more than the one role and brings magic to both.  Heather Graham gives a performance equal to that of her recent role as  Felicity Shagwell in Austin Powers and the supporting cast do exactly that,  they support.I actually find it hard to find a fault with this movie,  i've seen it twice in the last two days and it still hasn't revealed any  weaknesses. The dvd itself is better than average, offering a package that  includes outtakes, deleted scenes and a directors commentary. The disc  provides clarity in both sound and picture which makes watching Bowfinger  an entirely magnificent experience.
