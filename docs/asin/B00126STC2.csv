1135276,A48THA5X4OUAB,B00126STC2,Billyjack D'Urberville,"[64, 71]","This film is a work of extraordinary realism and balance. Focusing on the life and works of St. Teresa of Avila, and giving a full rounded portrayal of her, the film's agenda also broadens toward a universal statement about the Catholic life.  It becomes an illuminating unmasking of spiritual pitfalls, temptations and pretensions against the background of an age of history, with its own highs and lows that the journey of a saint's life must weather.  The Catholic position of course -- shocking to some of our Christian friends of other denominations -- is that simply ""witnessing"" or proclaiming faith is no guarantee -- Hell's maw is open to swallow you up until your last breath, and the greatest risks are interior, not exterior.Actress Concha Velasco is fully convincing at every stage of Teresa's life, and delivers a performance not matched in any other film based on Catholic themes I have ever seen.  The film itself, although little known in this country until recently, is a serious contender for the best Catholic film ever made to date.  In profound dimensionality it portrays not only the the humble consolations of the saint's life, but all the obstacles she must weather including grappling with her own personality, however insightful and gifted she may be.The other key to the film's success is the well directed script's unflinching realism and honesty.  Those with only superficial exposure to the great Spanish mystics, Teresa and John of the Cross, may be surprised and shocked by the film's early tackling of the saint's youthful faults and follies head on.  Simply, an American audience has ingested way too much cliched spiritual junk food in the form of lard-coated Hollywood ""epics"" ala The Greatest Story Ever Told, The Ten Commandments, and the like, unfortunately now celebrated as ""the golden days"" by certain Christian and Catholic venues.  We Catholics also had our very own turkeys, with child mystics portrayed like cutesy American kids next door in films based on Fatima and Lourdes, not even to mention the Bing Crosby/Barry Fitzgerald singing priest sagas, which at least had the excuse of being pure entertainment.  Recent ""instant biographies"" on film of figures like Mother Theresa and John Paul 2 haven't helped, either.  The way to paradise, in any of these clunkers, is indistinquishable from Dorothy's Yellow Brick Road in Oz, and the central ""saint"" figure virtually untistinguishable from Dorothy.This film was made a couple decades ago and retains the freshness of yesterday.  One suspects it will look the same way 50 years from now.  It sets a new standard for Catholic cinema, an Everest (or perhaps, more accurately, a treacherous K2) which will reduce any other ""religious"" film you have ever seen to foothills.",5,A New Standard in Catholic Cinema,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,2768,"['film', 'work', 'extraordinary', 'realism', 'balance', 'Focusing', 'life', 'works', 'St.', 'Teresa', 'Avila', 'giving', 'full', 'rounded', 'portrayal', 'film', 'agenda', 'also', 'universal', 'statement', 'Catholic', 'life', 'illuminating', 'unmasking', 'spiritual', 'pitfalls', 'temptations', 'pretensions', 'background', 'age', 'history', 'own', 'highs', 'lows', 'journey', 'saint', 'life', 'must', 'weather', 'Catholic', 'position', 'course', 'shocking', 'Christian', 'friends', 'other', 'denominations', 'simply', 'witnessing', 'proclaiming', 'faith', 'guarantee', 'Hell', 'maw', 'open', 'swallow', 'up', 'last', 'breath', 'greatest', 'risks', 'are', 'interior', 'not', 'exterior.Actress', 'Concha', 'Velasco', 'fully', 'convincing', 'stage', 'Teresa', 'life', 'performance', 'not', 'matched', 'other', 'film', 'based', 'Catholic', 'themes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'little', 'known', 'country', 'recently', 'serious', 'contender', 'best', 'Catholic', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'date', 'profound', 'dimensionality', 'not', 'only', 'humble', 'consolations', 'saint', 'life', 'obstacles', 'must', 'weather', 'including', 'grappling', 'own', 'personality', 'however', 'insightful', 'gifted', 'may', 'be.The', 'other', 'key', 'film', 'success', 'well', 'directed', 'script', 'unflinching', 'realism', 'honesty', 'only', 'superficial', 'exposure', 'great', 'Spanish', 'mystics', 'Teresa', 'John', 'Cross', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'film', 'early', 'tackling', 'saint', 'youthful', 'faults', 'follies', 'head', 'Simply', 'American', 'audience', 'ingested', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'cliched', 'spiritual', 'junk', 'food', 'form', 'lard-coated', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'ala', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Ever', 'Told', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'like', 'unfortunately', 'now', 'celebrated', 'golden', 'days', 'certain', 'Christian', 'Catholic', 'venues', 'Catholics', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'own', 'turkeys', 'child', 'mystics', 'portrayed', 'cutesy', 'American', 'kids', 'door', 'films', 'based', 'Fatima', 'Lourdes', 'not', 'even', 'mention', 'Bing', 'Crosby/Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'singing', 'priest', 'sagas', 'least', 'had', 'excuse', 'being', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'Recent', 'instant', 'biographies', 'film', 'figures', 'Mother', 'Theresa', 'John', 'Paul', '2', 'have', ""n't"", 'helped', 'way', 'paradise', 'clunkers', 'indistinquishable', 'Dorothy', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'Oz', 'central', 'saint', 'figure', 'virtually', 'untistinguishable', 'Dorothy.This', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'couple', 'decades', 'ago', 'freshness', 'yesterday', 'One', 'will', 'look', 'same', 'way', '50', 'years', 'now', 'new', 'standard', 'Catholic', 'cinema', 'Everest', 'perhaps', 'more', 'accurately', 'treacherous', 'K2', 'will', 'reduce', 'other', 'religious', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'foothills']",St. Teresa of Avila

1135278,A2YE5FAB8BHR82,B00126STC2,"Davide Bianchini ""Rising Suns""","[26, 30]","The movie is well made, and there are many redeeming aspects to it. It was undoubtedly a very good effort, and you can tell that the director was familiar with her autobiography and book of her Foundations. However, as with many movies on saints, it seems there is still much lacking, especially in subtleties. Evidently this happens in many saints movies. The directors try too much to make them seem human, portraying them as just very good people, but fail to show the life of heroic virtue, prayer, and profound interior life.For example, Saint Theresa stated in the book of her Foundations that she purposely restrained herself, especially in her love for her nuns, so that they would not develop an attachment to her, nor she to them. Yet the movie showed the opposite of this. Also, the movie portrays her as yearning to travel once she founded the first foundation, but in the book of her Foundations, she says explicitly that she would rather spend her life in solitude within the enclosure than traveling---she only did so out of obedience, not out of her own will.Furthermore, when she was confined to the convent and barred from founding further convents, the movie portrays her as afflicted and regretful. Yet she wrote in her Foundation that she was actually relieved to have been given the opportunity to live in peace for a while and not have to worry about the trials involved with founding new convents.It also seems to me that the real Saint Teresa would have been more discrete than the one portrayed here. For example, would she have been drawn into bickering about a broken wagon wheel as the movie portrayed? Would she or Fr. Gracian have expressed such outward anxiety over petty threats from others as the movie portrayed? I know the saints were still human, but a fundamental requirement of a saint is a basic trust in God. From everything I have read, I would even say that her trust in God would have been of such great account, that she would always be at peace through even the most trying external affairs (only openly expressing her struggles with her spiritual fathers).Again, these liberties that were taken, seem to bring the saint down to more of a human level.Also, the film portrays her as asserting her will very forcefully with others, in order to get her way. I wonder if this was true. If you have seen the documentary about Mother Teresa by the Petrie's, the way Mother Teresa handles conflicts in that documentary might be a more accurate picture of how Saint Teresa would handle tough situations; persistent, yes, but also very gentle and trusting. Also, she would have been more critical of herself, and her self-will, and perhaps a bit less....dramatic. Saint Teresa would also have been more calculating and deliberate in her every action, but equally docile as a dove; always seeking the counsel of wise priests (especially from the Jesuits, whom she esteemed greatly).I hope I do not sound too picky, but there is so much that Saint Theresa did and wrote that this movie did not show, that it left me feeling a little wanting. It would have been nice if they could have used more than two paragraphs of the saint's writings in the movie, rather than scripting a dialog from scratch.But again, these are all minor points, considering this is a genre of movies that is difficult to produce, because it means getting inside the head of a saint. This is where they fall short, and so they settle on focusing on externals, like a string of biographical sound-bytes, rather than the internal movements of their hearts. Watching them is like reading a time line from a history textbook, rather than a work of poetry or painting. But despite difficulties, the movie does better than average.",3,not the real Saint Teresa....but still a good movie,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,3733,"['movie', 'well', 'made', 'are', 'many', 'redeeming', 'aspects', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'very', 'good', 'effort', 'can', 'tell', 'director', 'was', 'familiar', 'autobiography', 'book', 'Foundations', 'However', 'many', 'movies', 'saints', 'still', 'much', 'lacking', 'especially', 'subtleties', 'Evidently', 'many', 'saints', 'movies', 'directors', 'try', 'too', 'much', 'make', 'seem', 'human', 'portraying', 'just', 'very', 'good', 'people', 'fail', 'show', 'life', 'heroic', 'virtue', 'prayer', 'interior', 'life.For', 'example', 'Saint', 'Theresa', 'stated', 'book', 'Foundations', 'purposely', 'restrained', 'especially', 'love', 'nuns', 'would', 'not', 'develop', 'attachment', 'movie', 'showed', 'opposite', 'Also', 'movie', 'yearning', 'travel', 'once', 'founded', 'first', 'foundation', 'book', 'Foundations', 'explicitly', 'would', 'rather', 'spend', 'life', 'solitude', 'enclosure', 'traveling', 'only', 'did', 'so', 'obedience', 'not', 'own', 'will.Furthermore', 'when', 'was', 'confined', 'convent', 'barred', 'founding', 'further', 'convents', 'movie', 'afflicted', 'regretful', 'wrote', 'Foundation', 'was', 'actually', 'relieved', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'opportunity', 'live', 'peace', 'while', 'not', 'have', 'worry', 'trials', 'involved', 'founding', 'new', 'convents.It', 'also', 'real', 'Saint', 'Teresa', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'discrete', 'one', 'portrayed', 'here', 'example', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'bickering', 'broken', 'wagon', 'wheel', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'Would', 'Fr', 'Gracian', 'have', 'expressed', 'such', 'outward', 'anxiety', 'petty', 'threats', 'others', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'know', 'saints', 'were', 'still', 'human', 'fundamental', 'requirement', 'saint', 'basic', 'trust', 'God', 'everything', 'have', 'read', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'trust', 'God', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'such', 'great', 'account', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'peace', 'even', 'most', 'trying', 'external', 'affairs', 'only', 'openly', 'expressing', 'struggles', 'spiritual', 'fathers', '.Again', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'seem', 'bring', 'saint', 'down', 'more', 'human', 'level.Also', 'film', 'asserting', 'will', 'very', 'forcefully', 'others', 'order', 'get', 'way', 'wonder', 'was', 'true', 'have', 'seen', 'documentary', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'Petrie', 'way', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'conflicts', 'documentary', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'picture', 'how', 'Saint', 'Teresa', 'would', 'handle', 'tough', 'situations', 'persistent', 'yes', 'also', 'very', 'gentle', 'trusting', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'critical', 'herself', 'self-will', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'less', '.dramatic', 'Saint', 'Teresa', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'calculating', 'deliberate', 'action', 'equally', 'docile', 'dove', 'always', 'seeking', 'counsel', 'wise', 'priests', 'especially', 'Jesuits', 'whom', 'esteemed', 'greatly', 'hope', 'do', 'not', 'sound', 'too', 'picky', 'so', 'much', 'Saint', 'Theresa', 'did', 'wrote', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'left', 'feeling', 'little', 'wanting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'saint', 'writings', 'movie', 'rather', 'scripting', 'dialog', 'scratch.But', 'again', 'are', 'minor', 'points', 'considering', 'genre', 'movies', 'difficult', 'produce', 'getting', 'head', 'saint', 'where', 'fall', 'short', 'so', 'settle', 'focusing', 'externals', 'string', 'biographical', 'sound-bytes', 'rather', 'internal', 'movements', 'hearts', 'Watching', 'reading', 'time', 'line', 'history', 'textbook', 'rather', 'work', 'poetry', 'painting', 'difficulties', 'movie', 'better', 'average']",St. Teresa of Avila

It is beautifully filmed and acted. There are many sets and locations for this film and that adds to its authenticity.  The mini-series spends a great amount of time into her personal struggles - both physical and spiritual.  One can see what she accomplished but there was a lack of in-depth spiritual examination and very little about the causes of her physical maladies.  one can guess that they were attacks from demonic forces but it would have been nice to get some clarification.  The other small issue I had was with the many nuns portrayed in the film.  There were so many who come in and out for brief moments that I sometimes lost track of who was who.

I've watched the series several times and can find nary a false note. The choice aspect of this universally praised piece is the pride of place it affords S.

Nothing is hurried.  Concha Velasco succeeds in a diamond-like portrayal of the saint; absolutely nothing stops an intense interior concentration on the screen every minute, every frame. A thoroughly remarkable performance to be treasured. Recommended especially for students of the Carmelite saint's teaching, and, happily enough, for those deeply familiar with Teresa's own writings.

She shows us a woman who was struggling with inner demons as her spiritual vocation was evolving towards the union she shared with her God as well as the difficulties of the era she lived in and the re-organization of the Carmelite order she was a part of and that had turned away from its original austere charisma. She found herself with enemies on both sides of the spectrum, from the laity as well as her own religious communities.
