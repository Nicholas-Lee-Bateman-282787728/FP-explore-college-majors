No one can beat Amazon's prices especially with the free S & H for orders more than $25.

At the time of its release, the company thought it would be a good idea to make you go online to watch them, by downloading Interactual media player. Interactual media player doesn't hold up well in 2011 & the website is gone! Just curious to know if this is the DVD edition I should buy or not.",5,deleted scenes,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,433,"['Does', 'anyone', 'know', 'product', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bought', 'How', 'Deal', 'dvd', 'useless', 'as', 'far', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'time', 'release', 'company', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'make', 'go', 'online', 'watch', 'downloading', 'Interactual', 'media', 'player', 'Interactual', 'media', 'player', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', '2011', 'website', 'gone', 'Just', 'curious', 'know', 'DVD', 'edition', 'should', 'buy', 'not']",How To Deal / Raise Your Voice
1084796,ASQAULYBV6QZT,B000S0SYIM,"Tiffany ""Sunshine""","[0, 1]","I bought this for my daughter as she is a big Sarah Dessen fan and turned me on to the books as well. We both couldn't wait to see ""How To Deal"",  the interpretation of ""Someone Like You"" & ""That Summer"" combined.All I can say is that it didn't do the book justice. Of course, they never do.But it was a fairly good movie if you don't have expectations. It was an enjoyable distraction for the afternoon, but I can't say that I'd watch it again anytime soon.As for ""Raise Your Voice"", I would say the same thing - an enjoyable distraction, but nothing that I would watch again too soon.",4,Not nearly as good as the book...,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,586,"['bought', 'daughter', 'big', 'Sarah', 'Dessen', 'fan', 'turned', 'books', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'How', 'Deal', 'interpretation', 'Someone', 'Summer', 'combined.All', 'can', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'course', 'never', 'do.But', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'expectations', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'distraction', 'afternoon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon.As', 'Raise', 'Your', 'Voice', 'would', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'enjoyable', 'distraction', 'nothing', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'too', 'soon']",How To Deal / Raise Your Voice
