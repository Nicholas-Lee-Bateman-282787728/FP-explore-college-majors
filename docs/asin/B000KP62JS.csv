1035482,AI6MKT2C9LYMG,B000KP62JS,G. Lewis,"[0, 0]","I PURCHASED THIS DVD AFTER REMEMBERING THE SERIES THAT CAME OUT IN THE EARLY 90'S BECAUSE I LOVED THE WOMEN OF BREWSTER PLACE MOVIE. AFTER SEEING ALL THE EPISODES AGAIN, SOME I REMEMBERED MORE THAN OTHERS, IM GLAD I MADE THE PURCHASE. FROM THE THEME SONG BY TAKE 6 TO THE ACTUAL EPISODES, IT WAS A GOOD SERIES. IM NOT SURE WHY THE RATINGS WERENT GOOD BACK THEN, BUT AFTER SEEING ALL THE EPISODES ON THE DVD, IT LEFT ME WANTING TO SEE MORE AND WISHED THEY HAD AT LEAST ONE MORE SEASON. OPRAH WASNT GIVEN HER JUST DUE AND CREDIT FOR THIS SERIES BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY, SERIOUS, AND REALLY GREAT ACTING ON ALL THE CHARACTERS PARTS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD PURCHASE TO ALL THOSE THAT HAVENT SEEN IT. IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE AND YOU HAVE AT LEAST 11 EPISODES FOR THE COST. THE CHARACTER OF SOPHIE PLAYED BY OLIVIA COLE WAS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE TO INCLUDE IN THE SERIES. I WISHED MORE OF THE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE CHARACTERS SUCH AS JACKEE', ROBIN GIVENS, PHYLLIS YVONNE STICKNEY, LONETTA MCKEE, LYNN WHITFIELD, AND BARBARA MONTGOMERY COULD HAVE BEEN IN THE SERIES. IM ALMOST CERTAIN IF MORE ORIGINAL MOVIE CHARACTERS WERE IN THE SERIES, THE RATINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALOT BETTER AND THE SERIES WOULD HAVE LASTED ALOT LONGER AT LEAST A COUPLE OF SEASONS. ALL IN ALL, I GIVE TWO THUMBS UP AND RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE",5,BREWSTER PLACE,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,1304,"['PURCHASED', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'AFTER', 'REMEMBERING', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'THAT', 'CAME', 'OUT', 'IN', 'THE', 'EARLY', '90', 'BECAUSE', 'LOVED', 'WOMEN', 'OF', 'BREWSTER', 'PLACE', 'MOVIE', 'AFTER', 'SEEING', 'ALL', 'THE', 'EPISODES', 'AGAIN', 'SOME', 'REMEMBERED', 'MORE', 'THAN', 'OTHERS', 'IM', 'GLAD', 'MADE', 'PURCHASE', 'THE', 'THEME', 'SONG', 'BY', 'TAKE', '6', 'TO', 'THE', 'ACTUAL', 'EPISODES', 'IT', 'WAS', 'A', 'GOOD', 'SERIES', 'IM', 'NOT', 'SURE', 'THE', 'RATINGS', 'WERENT', 'GOOD', 'BACK', 'THEN', 'BUT', 'AFTER', 'SEEING', 'ALL', 'THE', 'EPISODES', 'ON', 'THE', 'DVD', 'IT', 'LEFT', 'ME', 'WANTING', 'TO', 'SEE', 'MORE', 'AND', 'WISHED', 'THEY', 'HAD', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'ONE', 'MORE', 'SEASON', 'OPRAH', 'WASNT', 'GIVEN', 'HER', 'JUST', 'DUE', 'AND', 'CREDIT', 'FOR', 'THIS', 'SERIES', 'BECAUSE', 'IT', 'WAS', 'FUNNY', 'SERIOUS', 'AND', 'REALLY', 'GREAT', 'ACTING', 'ON', 'ALL', 'THE', 'CHARACTERS', 'PARTS', 'WOULD', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMEND', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'PURCHASE', 'TO', 'ALL', 'THOSE', 'THAT', 'HAVENT', 'SEEN', 'IT', 'IT', 'NOT', 'EXPENSIVE', 'AND', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'AT', 'LEAST', '11', 'EPISODES', 'THE', 'COST', 'THE', 'CHARACTER', 'OF', 'SOPHIE', 'PLAYED', 'BY', 'OLIVIA', 'COLE', 'WAS', 'AN', 'EXCELLENT', 'CHOICE', 'TO', 'INCLUDE', 'IN', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'WISHED', 'MORE', 'THE', 'THE', 'ORIGINAL', 'MOVIE', 'CHARACTERS', 'SUCH', 'JACKEE', 'ROBIN', 'GIVENS', 'PHYLLIS', 'YVONNE', 'STICKNEY', 'LONETTA', 'MCKEE', 'LYNN', 'WHITFIELD', 'AND', 'BARBARA', 'MONTGOMERY', 'COULD', 'HAVE', 'BEEN', 'IN', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'IM', 'ALMOST', 'CERTAIN', 'IF', 'MORE', 'ORIGINAL', 'MOVIE', 'CHARACTERS', 'WERE', 'IN', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'THE', 'RATINGS', 'WOULD', 'HAVE', 'BEEN', 'ALOT', 'BETTER', 'AND', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'WOULD', 'HAVE', 'LASTED', 'ALOT', 'LONGER', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'A', 'COUPLE', 'OF', 'SEASONS', 'ALL', 'IN', 'ALL', 'GIVE', 'TWO', 'THUMBS', 'UP', 'AND', 'RECOMMEND', 'TO', 'EVERYONE']",Brewster Place
