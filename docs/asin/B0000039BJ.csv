489840,AQMK5UYH9TTA8,B0000039BJ,BG,"[4, 4]","This was a ""Made for TV Movie"", that was on two nights for 2 hours each, on CBS. The high quality of this movie is very surprising for a 1980 TV movie. It is a shame this movie has not been put on DVD. The VHS version that I have is 195 minutes, which I believe is the full length version. It is hard to believe this movie is 30 years old now. Some of the actors in this movie are so young it will be hard for you to pick them out, like Laurence Fishburne, as Lightbulb.The movie is negative against the Vietnam War, but as a veteran, I believe it is fair for Vietnam. The war did get to many over there, and there was nothing to be happy about. In the end those who came home, most eventually went on with their lives, as did the Lt. Philip J. Caputo.Of course there are some technical issues with this movie. The big thing was the type of Huey helicopters used never made it to Vietnam until very late if at all. The Marines in 1965-66 were mostly flown in UH-34D's, known as ""Goonybirds"". Their hair is long for this time period. The Marines still required the ""High and Tight"" in this time period. In the big picture of things, these are minor. They still don't take away from a well done movie.This movie stays true to the awarding winning book, which is really saying something for a TV movie. The viewer will also be treated to a great performance by Brad Davis, a great actor who died way too young. I hope this will come out in DVD so future generations will be able to see this great movie.",5,One of the best TV Movies ever made,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,1500,"['was', 'Made', 'TV', 'Movie', 'was', 'two', 'nights', '2', 'hours', 'CBS', 'high', 'quality', 'movie', 'very', 'surprising', '1980', 'TV', 'movie', 'shame', 'movie', 'not', 'been', 'put', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'version', 'have', '195', 'minutes', 'believe', 'full', 'length', 'version', 'hard', 'believe', 'movie', '30', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'young', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'pick', 'out', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Lightbulb.The', 'movie', 'negative', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'veteran', 'believe', 'fair', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'did', 'get', 'many', 'there', 'was', 'nothing', 'be', 'happy', 'end', 'who', 'came', 'home', 'most', 'eventually', 'went', 'lives', 'did', 'Lt.', 'Philip', 'J.', 'Caputo.Of', 'course', 'are', 'technical', 'issues', 'movie', 'big', 'thing', 'was', 'type', 'Huey', 'helicopters', 'used', 'never', 'made', 'Vietnam', 'very', 'late', 'Marines', '1965-66', 'were', 'mostly', 'flown', 'UH-34D', 'known', 'Goonybirds', 'hair', 'long', 'time', 'period', 'Marines', 'still', 'required', 'High', 'Tight', 'time', 'period', 'big', 'picture', 'things', 'are', 'minor', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'well', 'done', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'true', 'awarding', 'winning', 'book', 'really', 'saying', 'something', 'TV', 'movie', 'viewer', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'treated', 'great', 'performance', 'Brad', 'Davis', 'great', 'actor', 'who', 'died', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'hope', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'future', 'generations', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

I was still sick the next day, so I got to catch the second part of it.  It was a movie that stuck out in my mind for its portrayal of the war.A few years later, I remember seeing the book and reading it.  The book was much better because it went into the mindset of the character and why he joined the Marines.
