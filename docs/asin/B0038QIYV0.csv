The romantic side of this story gets a little sappy as part of the overall pulling of all of the story lines together. Part of the entwined past coming together ending was foreshadowed in S2 Pt1 with Odin, the First Fist. While it does pull together, it's rather simplistic, predictable and generally unlikely (but that's a writer's stock in trade I guess). Still it does close out the first story arc (assuming they are planning a second). They have left it wide open for another season (or two). All this aside, while not my favorite of the three it is still a good watch and I'd say it was worth the price and time. As a whole the series was good with most areas being above average. May be suitable for teens or even children, but watch it first. We all have different opinions on what's okay for kids.",4,Must have been hoping for a season 3...,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,894,"['now', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'watched', 'season', 'one', 'least', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'story', 'line', 'romantic', 'side', 'story', 'little', 'sappy', 'part', 'overall', 'pulling', 'story', 'lines', 'together', 'Part', 'entwined', 'past', 'coming', 'together', 'ending', 'was', 'foreshadowed', 'S2', 'Pt1', 'Odin', 'First', 'Fist', 'pull', 'together', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'predictable', 'generally', 'unlikely', 'writer', 'stock', 'trade', 'guess', 'Still', 'close', 'first', 'story', 'arc', 'assuming', 'are', 'planning', 'second', 'have', 'left', 'wide', 'open', 'season', 'two', 'aside', 'not', 'favorite', 'three', 'still', 'good', 'watch', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'time', 'whole', 'series', 'was', 'good', 'most', 'areas', 'being', 'above', 'average', 'May', 'be', 'suitable', 'teens', 'even', 'children', 'watch', 'first', 'have', 'different', 'opinions', 'what', 'okay', 'kids']",N/A
1333000,A3NFO65EIFQRE1,B0038QIYV0,Laughing Dragon,"[1, 1]","I've already written a near-glowing review for Kenichi Season One, and I'm writing one about the second season because it contains a gem of an episode that truly crystallizes what is so appealing about this series and the Kenichi character himself: he's a put-upon loser AND a put-upon winner. No matter how much he progresses, he never really changes; he's basically a mouse who (very occasionally) roars. In the second series' fifth episode, Kenichi is taken to a mountain valley by a martial artist called The Elder, who is a cross between Gandalf and God. There he is put through the wringer - he is forced to find his own food, he is left to fend for himself against wild animals, and he is soon abandoned by his master. When a hermit finds him collapsed on the ground, he is taken in, fed and comforted. But the hermit is a martial artist as well, one who uses the art as a blood sport, and Kenichi must make a choice between following his original master (whom he's none too pleased with at the moment) and following the darker path of this new, seemingly-much-kinder master.Kenichi's reactions and expressions during his ordeal are classic.Whether he's running from a bear or throwing a tantrum at his master, his whines and protests are hilarious and touching. He is one of the most lovable and human of all anime heroes, and it is those qualities that really makes this series stand out. You really wind up caring about the little schmuck despite of (or maybe because of) his flaws. When the chips are down and the cause is just, the lion lurking in Kenichi's soul rouses and he can be a real badass in a fight. But it is his other side, the timid and flawed human side, that really makes Kenichi a winner.

1333001,AFV2584U13XP3,B0038QIYV0,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[3, 3]","The basic information of the series is this The stories main character Kenichi Shirahama who after being bullied at school for sometime even from some of the students of the martial arts club he tried joining to defend himself finds a young well endowed female transfer student by the name of Miu Furinji being set upon by some of the bullies fears for her safety but feels he can't do anything about it, but as he finds out she herself is quite a skilled martial arts fighter after seeing her defeat the pack of bullies easily, after trailing her unknowingly to her dojo home he sees the martial arts masters she lives with and after a somewhat forced pushing from one of the masters becomes their student. But after a few fight wins he now finds himself being faced with new opponents who are looking to reach the top by knocking off the stronger fighters that Kenichi has unknowingly placed himself in.The second season deals more with Kenichi having to face the Eight Heavy fist of the gang called Ragnarok in battles as they try in dissolve this problem to their group that Kenichi has caused with his heroics, and as with each of the Ragnarok fist he faces proves to be more powerful than the previous one forcing Kenichi to train harder in order to defeat the next challenger of Ragnarok. Also as he reaches the final fighters he'll meet a person in his past whose joined Ragnarok because of their past with Kenichi and who holds a deep grudge against Kenichi for their past together.  The series gives a nice closing of the anime somewhat but also leaves it open as it still leaves some questions too so it looks like we may see another season of Kenichi which I do hope for.  Again the animation and soundtrack for the series fits perfectly and the voice cast for both the Japanese and English crew did their parts very well too playing their character roles perfectly.  The video is standard format in the set comes like the usual Funimation box sets now a days with two dvd slim cases put into a paper sleeve,  the extras aren't anything to shout about just the trailers and textless intro/ending songs.  So if you already got the first season box set than finish the collection right away and if you're still not sure about the series check out the Funimation website for a few episodes you might be shocked about how enjoyable the series is for you....",5,A Nice Finale Closure To The Anime Series So Far,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,2365,"['basic', 'information', 'series', 'stories', 'main', 'character', 'Kenichi', 'Shirahama', 'who', 'being', 'bullied', 'school', 'sometime', 'even', 'students', 'martial', 'arts', 'club', 'tried', 'joining', 'defend', 'young', 'well', 'endowed', 'female', 'transfer', 'student', 'name', 'Miu', 'Furinji', 'being', 'set', 'upon', 'bullies', 'fears', 'safety', 'feels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'out', 'quite', 'skilled', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighter', 'seeing', 'defeat', 'pack', 'bullies', 'easily', 'trailing', 'unknowingly', 'dojo', 'home', 'martial', 'arts', 'masters', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'pushing', 'one', 'masters', 'becomes', 'student', 'few', 'fight', 'now', 'being', 'faced', 'new', 'opponents', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'reach', 'top', 'knocking', 'off', 'stronger', 'fighters', 'Kenichi', 'unknowingly', 'placed', 'in.The', 'second', 'season', 'deals', 'more', 'Kenichi', 'having', 'face', 'Eight', 'Heavy', 'fist', 'gang', 'called', 'Ragnarok', 'battles', 'try', 'dissolve', 'problem', 'group', 'Kenichi', 'caused', 'heroics', 'Ragnarok', 'fist', 'be', 'more', 'powerful', 'previous', 'one', 'forcing', 'Kenichi', 'train', 'harder', 'order', 'defeat', 'next', 'challenger', 'Ragnarok', 'Also', 'final', 'fighters', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'person', 'past', 'joined', 'Ragnarok', 'past', 'Kenichi', 'who', 'deep', 'grudge', 'Kenichi', 'past', 'together', 'series', 'nice', 'closing', 'anime', 'somewhat', 'also', 'open', 'still', 'questions', 'too', 'may', 'see', 'season', 'Kenichi', 'do', 'hope', 'Again', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'perfectly', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'English', 'crew', 'did', 'parts', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'playing', 'character', 'perfectly', 'video', 'standard', 'format', 'set', 'usual', 'Funimation', 'box', 'sets', 'now', 'days', 'two', 'dvd', 'slim', 'cases', 'put', 'paper', 'sleeve', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'shout', 'about', 'just', 'trailers', 'textless', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'So', 'already', 'got', 'first', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'finish', 'collection', 'right', 'away', ""'re"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'series', 'check', 'Funimation', 'website', 'few', 'episodes', 'might', 'be', 'shocked', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'series']",N/A
