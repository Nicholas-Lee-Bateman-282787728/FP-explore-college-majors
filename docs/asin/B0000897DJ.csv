736398,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0000897DJ,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[6, 7]","Given the subject matter, you expect this independent film by director/writer David Payne to be full of naked bodies gyrating to the beat of club music--certainly not a serious movie with plenty of bite.  But JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH scores in both directions, and in spite of the abundance of skin on display it is the story rather than the bodies that linger in mind after the movie ends.As seen through the eyes of club worker Chad (Johnathan Abue, playing a role loosely based on real-life Dan Peterson), JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH is surprisingly dark and surprisingly factual.  Steve Banerjee (Shelley Malil) is just another club owner until he stumbles into the idea of male strippers playing to a women-only audience, and the ringing cash register attracts ambitious and obnoxious choreographer Nick Denoia (Peter Nevargic). Once Denoia gets wise to Banerjee's shady dealings he quickly blackmails the club owner into signing away the touring rights to the show.  But when it comes to underhanded manipulations, Banerjee proves Denoia's equal and then some: the sex, drugs, and rock and roll atmosphere of the club quickly gives way to a headlong rush into murder, and the ride is straight down all the way.Payne's script isn't as tight as it might be, and it sometimes goes off on tangents that add little to the overall impact of the film, but the actors are first rate all the way and increasingly convoluted nature of the conspiracies and counter-conspiracies make for a fascinating ride.  And to up the ante, Payne endows the entire film with an unexpectedly dark humor and sense of irony that rings true even in the movie's weaker moments.Yes, there are plenty of naked bodies (both male and female) on display, but ultimately JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH is less about sex than it is about an extremely unsavory and seldom acknowledged side of the American dream, a drive for success that flattens every moral obstacle it meets.  In one particularly memorable scene, Banerjee snarls that Joe Kennedy built his fortune on illegal bootleg liquor and even sitting President Reagan lied to congress to finance a secret war; bending the law is the American way.  But not every one can get away with it--and even for those who do there is a price.  In this instance the price ranges from emotional deadness to drug addiction to accidental incest to blood.  And every one has to pay.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,Doing It The American Way,1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,2396,"['Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'expect', 'independent', 'film', 'director/writer', 'David', 'Payne', 'be', 'full', 'naked', 'bodies', 'gyrating', 'beat', 'club', 'music', 'certainly', 'not', 'serious', 'movie', 'plenty', 'bite', 'JUST', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'GET', 'ENOUGH', 'scores', 'directions', 'spite', 'abundance', 'skin', 'display', 'story', 'rather', 'bodies', 'linger', 'mind', 'movie', 'ends.As', 'seen', 'eyes', 'club', 'worker', 'Chad', 'Johnathan', 'Abue', 'playing', 'role', 'loosely', 'based', 'real-life', 'Dan', 'Peterson', 'JUST', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'GET', 'ENOUGH', 'surprisingly', 'dark', 'surprisingly', 'factual', 'Steve', 'Banerjee', 'Shelley', 'Malil', 'just', 'club', 'owner', 'idea', 'male', 'strippers', 'playing', 'women-only', 'audience', 'ringing', 'cash', 'register', 'ambitious', 'obnoxious', 'choreographer', 'Nick', 'Denoia', 'Peter', 'Nevargic', 'Once', 'Denoia', 'wise', 'Banerjee', 'shady', 'dealings', 'quickly', 'blackmails', 'club', 'owner', 'signing', 'away', 'touring', 'rights', 'show', 'when', 'underhanded', 'manipulations', 'Banerjee', 'Denoia', 'equal', 'then', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'atmosphere', 'club', 'quickly', 'way', 'headlong', 'rush', 'murder', 'ride', 'straight', 'way.Payne', 'script', ""n't"", 'as', 'tight', 'might', 'be', 'sometimes', 'tangents', 'add', 'little', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'way', 'increasingly', 'convoluted', 'nature', 'conspiracies', 'counter-conspiracies', 'make', 'fascinating', 'ride', 'up', 'ante', 'Payne', 'entire', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'dark', 'humor', 'sense', 'irony', 'true', 'even', 'movie', 'weaker', 'moments.Yes', 'are', 'plenty', 'naked', 'bodies', 'male', 'female', 'display', 'ultimately', 'JUST', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'GET', 'ENOUGH', 'less', 'sex', 'extremely', 'unsavory', 'seldom', 'acknowledged', 'side', 'American', 'dream', 'drive', 'success', 'moral', 'obstacle', 'one', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Banerjee', 'Joe', 'Kennedy', 'built', 'fortune', 'illegal', 'bootleg', 'liquor', 'even', 'sitting', 'President', 'Reagan', 'lied', 'congress', 'finance', 'secret', 'war', 'bending', 'law', 'American', 'way', 'not', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'even', 'who', 'do', 'price', 'instance', 'price', 'emotional', 'deadness', 'drug', 'addiction', 'accidental', 'incest', 'blood', 'one', 'pay.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

736402,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B0000897DJ,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[1, 1]","This fun, sweaty, juicy little independent movie from 2002 gives you the sizzle and the guys missing from the tepid Magic Mike.Although there is only a few seconds of a full frontal stripper, the rest look damned hot in their G-strings.The movie maker does a brilliant job working on a modest budget. By using clever camera angles, editing and pacing, you believe you're really seeing a lot more than just a basic few sets and a few outdoor shots.What stunned me was the amazing Jonathan Aube--a complete stranger to me who looks fabulous. Curiously, he's the only one of the handful of hunky dancers who never removes his britches. We see beautiful images of his powerful torso, gleaming with oil. He has a wonderfully shy, innocence that's very effective, but perhaps his agent wrote into his contract that Jonathan would not do any nudity. What a loss!There is also that enraging tendency of movie makers who create movies about male strippers to stop the show cold with endless scenes of dialogue, to move the story along dramatically. We keep waiting for the next dance routine.Also, in a curious foreshadowing of Magic Mike our gorgeous Jonathan falls in love with a dopey, whining woman, and then she thinks he's not stripping anymore and how happy she is about it, he instantly gives up the stripping trade and goes straight. And yes, there's the scene of his barfing into a trashcan as he realizes how horrible his life has becomes--because he takes off his clothes to make money!Anyway, I'm buying this for my library. They should do a remake of this, fill it full of gratuitous nudity and bring back the fabulous Jonathan Aube as a mature but still frisky pro, promote it, and watch the millions pour into the box office.This is how Magic Mike should have been produced and seen.",5,Move Over Magic Mike!,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,1790,"['fun', 'sweaty', 'juicy', 'little', 'independent', 'movie', '2002', 'sizzle', 'guys', 'missing', 'tepid', 'Magic', 'Mike.Although', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'full', 'frontal', 'stripper', 'rest', 'look', 'damned', 'hot', 'G-strings.The', 'movie', 'maker', 'brilliant', 'job', 'working', 'modest', 'budget', 'using', 'clever', 'camera', 'angles', 'editing', 'pacing', 'believe', ""'re"", 'really', 'seeing', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'basic', 'few', 'sets', 'few', 'outdoor', 'shots.What', 'stunned', 'was', 'amazing', 'Jonathan', 'Aube', 'complete', 'stranger', 'who', 'fabulous', 'Curiously', 'only', 'one', 'handful', 'hunky', 'dancers', 'who', 'never', 'britches', 'see', 'beautiful', 'images', 'powerful', 'torso', 'gleaming', 'oil', 'wonderfully', 'shy', 'innocence', 'very', 'effective', 'perhaps', 'agent', 'wrote', 'contract', 'Jonathan', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'nudity', 'What', 'loss', 'also', 'enraging', 'tendency', 'movie', 'makers', 'who', 'create', 'movies', 'male', 'strippers', 'stop', 'show', 'cold', 'endless', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'move', 'story', 'dramatically', 'keep', 'waiting', 'next', 'dance', 'routine.Also', 'curious', 'foreshadowing', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'gorgeous', 'Jonathan', 'love', 'dopey', 'whining', 'woman', 'then', 'not', 'stripping', 'anymore', 'how', 'happy', 'instantly', 'up', 'stripping', 'trade', 'straight', 'yes', 'scene', 'barfing', 'trashcan', 'how', 'horrible', 'life', 'becomes', 'clothes', 'make', 'money', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'buying', 'library', 'should', 'do', 'remake', 'fill', 'full', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'bring', 'back', 'fabulous', 'Jonathan', 'Aube', 'mature', 'still', 'frisky', 'pro', 'promote', 'watch', 'millions', 'pour', 'box', 'office.This', 'how', 'Magic', 'Mike', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'seen']",N/A

It is so much fun to watchthat you will a)wish you were part of the Chippendale team, and b)want togo out and dance. Think Boogie Nights, Saturday Night Fever, and Studio54, only less Hollywood, more the true story of a particular place, and aparticular group of dancers -- one that would most certainly go down inhistory.Following the original gang that started the club, and the nameChippendale, the movie shows us what happened from the beginning, whennobody knew what they were doing, and everyone just had a dream....a dreamto make a lot of money using their bodies. It was really quite simple. Wesee how this plan affected the dancers' personal lives, how the money, andthe fame, started to take over their lives. Next we go through the yearswhen the club was thriving, when the money was rolling in, and the sex anddrugs were at everyone's disposal. Then, when gay men wanted to comethrough the doors to drool over the sexy pecs and big you-know-whats,things started to go down hill. Corruption took over, people ordered otherpeople killed, and eventually, the Chippendales were essentially murderedto the ground. The Chippendale dancers are a part of history -- a part ofsex work history, of gay history, of LA history....of history.Just Can't Get Enough does a wonderful job telling their story.
