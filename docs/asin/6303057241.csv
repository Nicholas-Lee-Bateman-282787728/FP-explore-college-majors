He's been zapped by lightning while being given an MRI, resulting in his soul being sucked out and deposited into the internet! Now, he's able to track his victims down in no time, using household appliances to burn, drown, and electricute his prey! Terry Monroe (Karen Allen) finds herself on the disembodied killer's list, along w/ her family and friends. What can she do when even her toaster could be a murderous device of doom? It all sounds hokey, and it is. However, this movie is not lacking in entertainment value.

353522,A30KQVQI3WI4L7,6303057241,Craig Martin,"[1, 2]","There is little I can add to what has already been said about Ghost in the Machine. It has some amusing surprises that other reviewers do not discuss (like the death of a man at an automobile crash test site that plays with suspense very well and ends with an amusing surprise). What makes the film particularly interesting is how appliances are used to provide point-of-view shots and how they kill people in some innovative and occasionally quite grisly ways, creating an us-and-them scenario that works really well (something that doesn't work so well in King's Maximum Overdrive) and creates a palpable sense of unease. Without getting too carried away, it does for whitegoods what Jaws did for swimming.Ghost in the Machine appeared at a time when slasher films had become so pass&eacute; that creative death sequences had become pretty much their only attraction. Its hardly surprising then to learn that Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare helmer Rachel Talalay also directed this film as it likewise has its fair share of creative and icky death sequences. On a side note, Freddy's Dead is unfairly a much maligned film - mainly because of the appalling 3D sequence at the end - which was done despite Talalay's protests. If anyone is to be blamed for that debacle, its Robert Shaye and Aron Warner. It's nice that Talalay was given a second chance with Ghost in the Machine as it showed she has some directing chops, which she proved again in 1995 with the outlandish Tank Girl (the film that gave Naomi Watts an inroad into Hollywood filmmaking that led to her break through role in Mulholland Drive four years later). Tank Girl was Talalay's last feature film and ever since the mid-90s she has been very busy directing for television.Much has been said about the dated special effects from 1993, particularly the computer animated effects in the final climax, but these were cutting edge for their time and they still look pretty cool, particularly in comparison to the onslaught of cheap and nasty CGI FX used today, such as you might find in Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus and its ilk (one could easily criticise Terminator 2: Judgement Day of some pretty hokey CGI - such as when the T1000 emerges from the truck crash inferno - but again, these were effects created at a time when there were specific limitations to this emerging technology and they stand as competently made artefacts of a particular age). I recall reading about how the CGI effects in Ghost in the Machine were achieved in FX magazine (where it was the feature story) and when I saw the film on its initial theatrical release, I remember being really impressed by what had been achieved. Ghost in the Machine is hardly an original concept. Wes Craven's films, Shocker and Deadly Friend both play with similar Frankensteinian ideas and have a great sense of humour, and Virtuosity (starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crow) which comes from the same period (1995) likewise pushes the envelope of what CGI was capable of at that time. Despite not being an original concept, Ghost in the Machine is nevertheless a really fun addition to the science fiction/horror genre and well worth a look for intrepid cinephiles.",3,A competently-made artefact true to its time ...,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,3197,"['little', 'can', 'add', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'amusing', 'surprises', 'other', 'reviewers', 'do', 'not', 'discuss', 'death', 'man', 'automobile', 'crash', 'test', 'site', 'suspense', 'very', 'well', 'amusing', 'surprise', 'What', 'film', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'how', 'appliances', 'are', 'used', 'provide', 'point-of-view', 'shots', 'how', 'kill', 'people', 'innovative', 'occasionally', 'quite', 'grisly', 'ways', 'creating', 'us-and-them', 'scenario', 'really', 'well', 'something', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'King', 'Maximum', 'Overdrive', 'palpable', 'sense', 'unease', 'getting', 'too', 'carried', 'away', 'whitegoods', 'what', 'Jaws', 'did', 'swimming.Ghost', 'Machine', 'appeared', 'time', 'when', 'slasher', 'films', 'had', 'become', 'so', 'pass', 'eacute', 'creative', 'death', 'sequences', 'had', 'become', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'attraction', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'then', 'learn', 'Freddy', 'Dead', 'Final', 'Nightmare', 'helmer', 'Rachel', 'Talalay', 'also', 'directed', 'film', 'fair', 'share', 'creative', 'icky', 'death', 'sequences', 'side', 'note', 'Freddy', 'Dead', 'unfairly', 'much', 'maligned', 'film', 'mainly', 'appalling', '3D', 'sequence', 'end', 'was', 'done', 'Talalay', 'protests', 'anyone', 'be', 'blamed', 'debacle', 'Robert', 'Shaye', 'Aron', 'Warner', 'nice', 'Talalay', 'was', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'showed', 'directing', 'chops', 'proved', 'again', '1995', 'outlandish', 'Tank', 'Girl', 'film', 'gave', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'inroad', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'led', 'break', 'role', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'Tank', 'Girl', 'was', 'Talalay', 'last', 'feature', 'film', 'ever', 'mid-90s', 'been', 'very', 'busy', 'directing', 'television.Much', 'been', 'said', 'dated', 'special', 'effects', '1993', 'particularly', 'computer', 'animated', 'effects', 'final', 'climax', 'were', 'cutting', 'edge', 'time', 'still', 'look', 'pretty', 'cool', 'particularly', 'comparison', 'onslaught', 'cheap', 'nasty', 'CGI', 'FX', 'used', 'today', 'such', 'might', 'find', 'Mega', 'Shark', 'vs', 'Giant', 'Octopus', 'ilk', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'criticise', 'Terminator', '2', 'Judgement', 'Day', 'pretty', 'hokey', 'CGI', 'such', 'when', 'T1000', 'truck', 'crash', 'inferno', 'again', 'were', 'effects', 'created', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'specific', 'limitations', 'emerging', 'technology', 'stand', 'competently', 'made', 'artefacts', 'particular', 'age', 'recall', 'reading', 'how', 'CGI', 'effects', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'were', 'achieved', 'FX', 'magazine', 'where', 'was', 'feature', 'story', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'remember', 'being', 'really', 'impressed', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'achieved', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'hardly', 'original', 'concept', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'films', 'Shocker', 'Deadly', 'Friend', 'play', 'similar', 'Frankensteinian', 'ideas', 'have', 'great', 'sense', 'humour', 'Virtuosity', 'starring', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Russell', 'Crow', 'same', 'period', '1995', 'likewise', 'envelope', 'what', 'CGI', 'was', 'capable', 'time', 'not', 'being', 'original', 'concept', 'Ghost', 'Machine', 'nevertheless', 'really', 'fun', 'addition', 'science', 'fiction/horror', 'genre', 'well', 'look', 'intrepid', 'cinephiles']",Ghost in the Machine VHS

353528,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6303057241,Michael Butts,"[7, 9]","The concept of a serial killer's soul living inside a computer is a frightening and interesting theme.  However, director Rachel Talalay doesn't infuse this movie with enough tension and surprises.  Karen Allen stars as a single mother who makes the mistake of leaving her address book at the store where the serial killer works.  He is planning to return it to her, and kill her of course, but he is in a horrible accident, placed in an MRI, a storm comes, and kaboom somehow his soul remains alive in the computer and he accesses Allen's address book and starts killing them off.  Allen, a competent actress, does okay with her role, but it's not developed enough to place a lot of concern for her well being.  Chris Mulkey (Hidden) stars as computer hack Bram Walker, whose career got halted when he hacked into the IRS and gave all the residents of each state .05 extra on their return.  Mulkey has a brooding handsomeness, and a good screen presence, but isn't given a lot to do.  Wil Horneff as Allen's teenage son has just reached puberty and he and his friend pay their sexy babysitter 37 dollars to unbutton her blouse.  Of course, by the end of the film, Horneff is placed in jeopardy and the serial killer threatens our heroes lives in the college computer room.  Ted Marcoux as the serial killer isn't given enough screen time to truly intimidate the audience, but his brief time is effective.GHOST IN THE MACHINE is a 1993 film, and the special effects for that time period are fairly inventive.This is certainly not a rotten tomato, but it might have been better with more assured pacing and direction.",3,MAGNETIC ENDING,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,1616,"['concept', 'serial', 'killer', 'soul', 'living', 'computer', 'frightening', 'interesting', 'theme', 'However', 'director', 'Rachel', 'Talalay', ""n't"", 'infuse', 'movie', 'enough', 'tension', 'surprises', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'mistake', 'leaving', 'address', 'book', 'store', 'where', 'serial', 'killer', 'works', 'planning', 'return', 'kill', 'course', 'horrible', 'accident', 'placed', 'MRI', 'storm', 'kaboom', 'somehow', 'soul', 'alive', 'computer', 'Allen', 'address', 'book', 'killing', 'off', 'Allen', 'competent', 'actress', 'okay', 'role', 'not', 'developed', 'enough', 'place', 'lot', 'concern', 'well', 'being', 'Chris', 'Mulkey', 'Hidden', 'computer', 'hack', 'Bram', 'Walker', 'career', 'got', 'halted', 'when', 'hacked', 'IRS', 'gave', 'residents', 'state', '.05', 'extra', 'return', 'Mulkey', 'brooding', 'handsomeness', 'good', 'screen', 'presence', ""n't"", 'given', 'lot', 'do', 'Wil', 'Horneff', 'Allen', 'teenage', 'son', 'just', 'reached', 'puberty', 'friend', 'pay', 'sexy', 'babysitter', '37', 'dollars', 'unbutton', 'blouse', 'course', 'end', 'film', 'Horneff', 'placed', 'jeopardy', 'serial', 'killer', 'heroes', 'college', 'computer', 'room', 'Ted', 'Marcoux', 'serial', 'killer', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'truly', 'intimidate', 'audience', 'brief', 'time', 'effective.GHOST', 'IN', 'THE', 'MACHINE', '1993', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'fairly', 'inventive.This', 'certainly', 'not', 'rotten', 'tomato', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'assured', 'pacing', 'direction']",Ghost in the Machine VHS
