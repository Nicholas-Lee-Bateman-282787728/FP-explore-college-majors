Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[9, 9]","Of all of Big Vision's DVD releases of the wonderful series ""Ghost Hunters,"" Part One of Season Three is their best effort.  The video quality is excellent and the audio is ten times better than all of their previous efforts.  I own all of the ""Ghost Hunters"" series DVDs and am very happy that Big Vision finally got it right.As for the actual shows in this set, all of them are excellent.  Sure, the results of some of the investigations are a letdown, but that's what makes this show so believable.  If Jason, Grant and the gang always found evidence of a haunting, I'd become suspicious of them.  Instead, the viewer is given an insightful look at the ups and downs of paranormal investigations.  Sometimes it's a goosechase.  Sometimes it's amazing.  Every once in awhile, the TAPS run into something they can't explain.All of the episodes are excellent, but my personal favorites are ""Leap Castle,"" ""Lisheen Ruins & Viaduct Tavern,"" and ""OK Corral & Copper Queen Hotel.""**Potential Spoilers**As with the other series sets, there is bonus footage and deleted/extended scenes.  One of the best deleted scenes involves Tango and Jason after an attack at Leap Castle on Dustin.  It shows a very upset Tango intent on facing the elemental that attacked his teammate and a very concerned Jay explaining to him to calm down and hold back.  We get great insight on both of them from this interaction and I actually like them even more after all is said and done.**End Spoilers**If you're already a fan of the series, I'm wasting my breath with you.  You already know how great this show is.  If you've never watched ""Ghost Hunters"" before, you're in for a real treat.  This group seeks out to disprove as much phenomena as they can and even when the unexplainable occurs, they're still hesitant to label a place as haunted.This is the best DVD transfer of the show so far and the best season they've ever had.

Otherwise, the three DVDs are lots of fun to view.  The three episodes in Ireland/England are the most entertaining, being an exploration of mythology of hauntings as well as a search for ghosts.  As usual, nothing much is documented, but the activities of the team in such places as Leap Castle or the Hellfire caves is very entertaining, as is the presence of an Irish counterpart, Barry, who is very emotional and at times, almost hysterical.  He adds a lot of drama to the episodes, although not in a tense way but sort of comical.  Brian Harnois is here as well, and my opinion is that he's the best of the team since he is so enthusiastic as well as being a nice guy, unlike Steve, who is his usual nasty self.  I am sorry to hear that Brian has moved on, since episodes that lacked him were always dull, although it is understandable since he was consistently the target of Jason's anger management problem.  He will be hard to replace, and as of the current shows running on cable, the second half of season 3, they aren't doing a good job of finding his or Donna's replacement.  Nor are they getting themselves any scientific credibility, which the team seems to want, by not having scientists (e.g., first season's Paula) on the team.  The quality of the DVDs in this set is better than the past -- the sound is very good, although at a few times, slightly fuzzy.

But really, it's quite an entertaining show and they get more polished as time goes along.Ghost Hunters is about The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS).  Created by Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, plumbers, it groups together a bunch of like-minded people for paranormal investigations.  What makes TAPS different though is that they try to disprove hauntings.  That way, when theyr'e left with evidence they can't explain, it seems more legitimate.  And they use a variety of tools to help them in these investigations.  EMF detectors, video, audio and thermal devices.  All of these are in an effort to have tangible proof that other people can see rather than relying on eye-witness accounts.They have a pretty solid group of people they work with too.  Jason and Grant are the leaders of course, and almost always pair together when investigating.  But even though they are polar opposites they still work together quite well.  Steve is the tech manager and he is endearing and serious all at the same time.  He's also dropped some of his girl-craziness from the first season.  Brian is still a little flighty, but he's not as distracting in this season as he is in the others.  And Tango is just adorable and fun to watch as an Investigator in Training.  They all seem to have a real passion for what they're doing which is refreshing.They investigate several different types of places in this half season.  The Bird Cage Theatre (great episode with great evidence), OK Corral, Copper Queen Hotel, West Virginia Penitentiary, Bucksteep Manor, Stanley Hotel, General Stanton Inn, and private residences.  But then they also go to Ireland and England to investigate some hauntings over there and that was quite interesting as well.  Although I wasn't as fond of the European investigator who kept taking them away from the Hauntings in apparent concern for their safety.  Personally I think if it meant good evidence they would have gladly taken a blow for the team so he shouldn't have interfered.  It was frustrating.The film is the same as it was in the 2nd season.  Better than the first season but still not great.  They're equipment is a little better and some of the video is quite clear.  But some of it still has some fuzziness.  And the sound is good, except for when they're constantly playing the special effects and music, which is distracting.I really enjoy watching this series.  It provides a lot of unknown and interesting evidence but they don't find something in every episode.  So it makes it believable.  If you have any interest in the paranormal this is a good series to watch.Review by M.

The investigation at The Birdcage in Tombstone was awesome, and the USS Lexington episode was fantastic. But, to me, the investigation that involved the Manson Murders, and the tortured sounds of those EVPs really shook me, I have to admit.That one stuck with me, and I would have to say that was the most gut and heart-wrenching of any episode of Ghost Hunters I've seen.I write horror, and I don't shake easily, but remembering how beautiful Sharon Tate was and hearing those EVPs really got to me.That has to be one of their best investigations yet.EDIT:When this review was written, the product information was not yet up. As the Manson episode was the last episode of Part One of Season Three, I assumed it would be on Part One of Season Three's DVD set. Apparently it is not.But, Tombstone, The Stanley, and Nightmare Noises are, and they are definitely worth checking out.GH has come to my town for Eastern State Penitentiary, I wish they would come back and do Fort Mifflin (a supposedly VERY active fort that was used in the Revolutionary War where hundreds died battling the British Navy as they pushed their way up the Delaware giving Washington time to regroup at Valley Forge, and later became a prison during the Civil War).",5,Another Great Season,1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,1340,"['other', 'Paranormal', 'there', 'still', 'find', 'TAPS', 'be', 'most', 'credible', 'investigation', 'Birdcage', 'Tombstone', 'was', 'awesome', 'USS', 'Lexington', 'episode', 'was', 'fantastic', 'investigation', 'involved', 'Manson', 'Murders', 'tortured', 'sounds', 'EVPs', 'really', 'shook', 'have', 'admit.That', 'one', 'stuck', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'most', 'gut', 'heart-wrenching', 'episode', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', ""'ve"", 'seen.I', 'write', 'horror', 'do', ""n't"", 'shake', 'easily', 'remembering', 'how', 'beautiful', 'Sharon', 'Tate', 'was', 'hearing', 'EVPs', 'really', 'got', 'me.That', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'investigations', 'yet.EDIT', 'When', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'product', 'information', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'up', 'Manson', 'episode', 'was', 'last', 'episode', 'Part', 'One', 'Season', 'Three', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'Part', 'One', 'Season', 'Three', 'DVD', 'set', 'not.But', 'Tombstone', 'Stanley', 'Nightmare', 'Noises', 'are', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.GH', 'come', 'town', 'Eastern', 'State', 'Penitentiary', 'wish', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'do', 'Fort', 'Mifflin', 'supposedly', 'VERY', 'active', 'fort', 'was', 'used', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'where', 'hundreds', 'died', 'battling', 'British', 'Navy', 'pushed', 'way', 'Delaware', 'giving', 'Washington', 'time', 'regroup', 'Valley', 'Forge', 'later', 'became', 'prison', 'Civil', 'War']","Ghost Hunters: Season 3, Part 1"
