1001346,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000GBEPE0,Brian E. Erland,"[1, 3]","Journey to Cairo, Egypt along with Natasha Senovich, an America bellydancer and explore the 'Mecca in the Art of the Bellydance' as it struggles to survive in an ever-growing environment of hostility as the culture of its birth evolves into a more conservative, Islamic mindset. Natasha's informative, educational, entertaining and sensual documentary 'The Bellydancers of Cairo' is an absolute treat from beginning to end comprised of interviews with contemporary performers, famous and obscure, video clips and still photos from famous dancers in the past. The viewer will move from 5 star clubs located in the best hotels in Cairo to small off-the-beaten-path cabarets in less accessible locations of the city.Viewing the night life of this exotic city and it's most sensual bellydancers in their natural environment is would surely be enough to make this DVD a worthwhile watch. But there is so much more to this program than that. The production also does a marvelous job at investigating the contemporary cultural attitudes towards this art form in the light of tightening Islamic conservatism in Egypt and the difficult, sometimes dangerous situation the dancer is put in. The courage and determination it takes to become a practitioner of this glorious and sensual art will definitely surprise and amaze the novice viewer and most certainly inspire dancers outside the confines of the Middle East to covet and sustain the dance for future generations.The DVD also contains a fascinating 'Director's Commentary' and 9 live, intimate performances from some of Cairo's best bellydancer's! If you own only one bellydancing DVD this should be it!",5,"""Moving In An Oriental Way"" ~ The Trials And Tribulations Accompanying That Feeling In The Pelvis",1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,1649,"['Journey', 'Cairo', 'Egypt', 'Natasha', 'Senovich', 'America', 'bellydancer', 'explore', ""'Mecca"", 'Art', 'Bellydance', 'survive', 'ever-growing', 'environment', 'hostility', 'culture', 'birth', 'more', 'conservative', 'Islamic', 'mindset', 'Natasha', 'informative', 'educational', 'entertaining', 'sensual', 'documentary', 'Bellydancers', 'Cairo', 'absolute', 'treat', 'beginning', 'end', 'comprised', 'interviews', 'contemporary', 'performers', 'famous', 'obscure', 'video', 'clips', 'still', 'photos', 'famous', 'dancers', 'past', 'viewer', 'will', 'move', '5', 'star', 'clubs', 'located', 'best', 'hotels', 'Cairo', 'small', 'off-the-beaten-path', 'cabarets', 'less', 'accessible', 'locations', 'city.Viewing', 'night', 'life', 'exotic', 'city', 'most', 'sensual', 'bellydancers', 'natural', 'environment', 'would', 'surely', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'DVD', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'program', 'production', 'also', 'marvelous', 'job', 'investigating', 'contemporary', 'cultural', 'attitudes', 'art', 'form', 'light', 'tightening', 'Islamic', 'conservatism', 'Egypt', 'difficult', 'sometimes', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'dancer', 'put', 'courage', 'determination', 'become', 'practitioner', 'glorious', 'sensual', 'art', 'will', 'definitely', 'surprise', 'amaze', 'novice', 'viewer', 'most', 'certainly', 'inspire', 'dancers', 'confines', 'Middle', 'East', 'covet', 'sustain', 'dance', 'future', 'generations.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'fascinating', ""'Director"", 'Commentary', '9', 'live', 'intimate', 'performances', 'Cairo', 'best', 'bellydancer', 'own', 'only', 'one', 'bellydancing', 'DVD', 'should', 'be']",N/A
1001347,AEV6T72PZFEHX,B000GBEPE0,"Ettell ""ettell""","[3, 9]","I essentially bought this DVD because the review said:""...With unprecedented access, we see them (Egyptian Belly Dancers) perform and hear them share their personal stories of conflict and struggle they have experienced throughout their careers...""This was achieved to some extent - there were indeed what appeared to be live interviews (I say this because the reporter was never in the shot.) I would have preferred for the setting to be more intimate (greater interaction with the reporter).The reporter interviewed some unidentified gentleman whose views represent a section of the population's - but on the whole, I would have liked to have known what the younger generation (both male and female) felt.I found this documentary disappointing in the fact that there was not one single complete performance shown - neither the clips from movies, nor the live performances of present day stars - during the documentary. However, there is a ""Special Features"" section featuring one or two dances from some of the dancers interviewed. That is one of the best parts of this production.I would say that the subject was definitely worth making a documentary about, but that this particular one was a bit too shallow for me in it's content.I can appreciate that Egypt may not be the easiest place in which to explore certain subjects, but I feel there could have been more substance on the whole. As an analogy, I would say the result comes across as the difference between someone visiting a country as a tourist, who gets only a brief skecth of the place, and someone who has lived there and immersed themselves in the culture.I would have preferred if this report had come across as if the reporter had sojourned in Egypt, had developped frienships and was truly on intimate terms with some native enthusiastes, dancers or not. In other words, I found this documentary rather impersonal.Although there is a section where the produceur and her assistant explain their adventure.",3,Too superficial - not substantial enough to want to own.,1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,1975,"['essentially', 'bought', 'DVD', 'review', 'said', 'unprecedented', 'access', 'see', 'Egyptian', 'Belly', 'Dancers', 'perform', 'hear', 'share', 'personal', 'stories', 'conflict', 'struggle', 'have', 'experienced', 'careers', 'was', 'achieved', 'extent', 'were', 'indeed', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'live', 'interviews', 'say', 'reporter', 'was', 'never', 'shot', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'setting', 'be', 'more', 'intimate', 'greater', 'interaction', 'reporter', '.The', 'reporter', 'interviewed', 'unidentified', 'gentleman', 'views', 'represent', 'section', 'population', 'whole', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'what', 'younger', 'generation', 'male', 'female', 'felt.I', 'found', 'documentary', 'disappointing', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'complete', 'performance', 'shown', 'clips', 'movies', 'live', 'performances', 'present', 'day', 'documentary', 'However', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'featuring', 'one', 'two', 'dances', 'dancers', 'interviewed', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'production.I', 'would', 'say', 'subject', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'making', 'documentary', 'particular', 'one', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'shallow', 'content.I', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Egypt', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'easiest', 'place', 'explore', 'certain', 'subjects', 'feel', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'substance', 'whole', 'analogy', 'would', 'say', 'result', 'difference', 'someone', 'visiting', 'country', 'tourist', 'who', 'only', 'brief', 'skecth', 'place', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'immersed', 'culture.I', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'report', 'had', 'come', 'reporter', 'had', 'sojourned', 'Egypt', 'had', 'developped', 'frienships', 'was', 'truly', 'intimate', 'terms', 'native', 'enthusiastes', 'dancers', 'not', 'other', 'words', 'found', 'documentary', 'rather', 'section', 'where', 'produceur', 'assistant', 'explain', 'adventure']",N/A

I used to look at Egyptian dancers when they were speaking about their skill, grace, and understanding of the music, and I would roll my eyes and think, ""UGH!  How egotistical can you get?""  But, after watching this information packed DVD, I have such admiration for the women of this dance that, despite all the harrassment, danger, humiliation, and degredation, the hold their heads high, and they continue to do what their soul is calling for them to do...to be an instrument of the dance.  They articulate what the dance means to them, and it is just fascinating.  In many ways, I can relate, and I believe you will too.  With all they have lost, and fought to attain, it is no wonder they think so highly of themselves.  It takes that kind of moxy.The documentary is a time capsule treasure, because no one knows the future of this dance in the Middle East.  To have captured all of these dancers, in their own words, and with footage of their dance to be forever preserved, it is something every dancer must see, and in my opinion must own.  Just even studying the dancing is amazing.The director's commentary was very interesting and brought even more light to the subject of women in the culture, and women and the dance. When you add in the performances (2 from each dancer), and the director's commentary, along with the original documentary, it has HOURS of information.  It is a bargain at this price, but it is worth even more.I purchased this as a gift for my own dance instructor, after I saw it myself.  And, I purchased one for me.  I think I am going to have all my dance buddies come over for an evening and view it.  It's that good.Seriously, there's a lot of dance stuff out there to purchase, and we (at least me) can't have it all, but I would have no problem, whole heartedly recommending this DVD.

1001352,A3QFE1H3RUP6Z7,B000GBEPE0,"Shantell Powell ""The ShanMonster""","[24, 25]","Last night, I watched The Belly Dancers of Cairo.  It's an excellent but sad documentary on the state of raqs sharqi in Egypt today.  Despite the increasing popularity of the dance internationally, belly dance is dying in Egypt.  Through interviews with Egyptian dance legends (eg. Dina, Nagwa Fuad, Lucy), current performers, a Muslim feminist, and a variety of Egyptian men from different walks of life, we can see how dancers are simultaneously loved and reviled.  We are given cultural and religious context for this apparent contradiction.Although raqs sharqi from the golden age of Egyptian cinema is looked upon fondly by the conservative men interviewed, their appreciation is conflicted.  Dancers are looked upon as whores, a view reinforced by the dance films shown on a daily basis.  Dancers in movies are invariably portrayed as wanton women, or gangsters' molls.  To allow a female member of one's family to become a dancer would bring shame down on the entire family.  More liberally-minded men may date a dancer, but once they get married, or once she bears children, she will have to end her career.The film touches on how women in the public eye are considered to have questionable virtue.  However, there is no mention of Oum Kalthoum, who was considered a national treasure.  I can't help but be curious to see if she was considered a floozy at the same time that she was revered.The documentary ends on a bittersweet note.  Although the dance is dying in Egypt, it has spread itself over the world.  These non-Egyptian dancers are responsible to carry on the legacy, and to save what would otherwise be a dying art form.  And just so we're not without context, the DVD has an excellent features section which contains full-length performances by a variety of Egyptian dancers.I need to get myself a copy of this.  I recommend it to students of all varieties of belly dance (whether traditional Egyptian or any of the more modern fusion variants).",5,Requisite Viewing for all Belly Dance Students,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,1966,"['Last', 'night', 'watched', 'Belly', 'Dancers', 'Cairo', 'excellent', 'sad', 'documentary', 'state', 'raqs', 'sharqi', 'Egypt', 'today', 'increasing', 'popularity', 'dance', 'internationally', 'belly', 'dance', 'dying', 'Egypt', 'interviews', 'Egyptian', 'dance', 'legends', 'eg', 'Dina', 'Nagwa', 'Fuad', 'Lucy', 'current', 'performers', 'Muslim', 'feminist', 'variety', 'Egyptian', 'men', 'different', 'walks', 'life', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'dancers', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'loved', 'reviled', 'are', 'given', 'cultural', 'religious', 'context', 'apparent', 'contradiction.Although', 'raqs', 'sharqi', 'golden', 'age', 'Egyptian', 'cinema', 'looked', 'fondly', 'conservative', 'men', 'interviewed', 'appreciation', 'conflicted', 'Dancers', 'are', 'looked', 'whores', 'view', 'reinforced', 'dance', 'films', 'shown', 'daily', 'basis', 'Dancers', 'movies', 'are', 'invariably', 'portrayed', 'wanton', 'women', 'gangsters', 'molls', 'allow', 'female', 'member', 'one', 'family', 'become', 'dancer', 'would', 'bring', 'shame', 'down', 'entire', 'family', 'More', 'liberally-minded', 'men', 'may', 'date', 'dancer', 'once', 'get', 'married', 'once', 'children', 'will', 'have', 'end', 'career.The', 'film', 'touches', 'how', 'women', 'public', 'eye', 'are', 'considered', 'have', 'questionable', 'virtue', 'However', 'mention', 'Oum', 'Kalthoum', 'who', 'was', 'considered', 'national', 'treasure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'curious', 'see', 'was', 'considered', 'floozy', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'revered.The', 'documentary', 'ends', 'bittersweet', 'note', 'dance', 'dying', 'Egypt', 'spread', 'world', 'non-Egyptian', 'dancers', 'are', 'responsible', 'carry', 'legacy', 'save', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'dying', 'art', 'form', 'just', 'so', ""'re"", 'not', 'context', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'features', 'section', 'full-length', 'performances', 'variety', 'Egyptian', 'dancers.I', 'need', 'get', 'copy', 'recommend', 'students', 'varieties', 'belly', 'dance', 'traditional', 'Egyptian', 'more', 'modern', 'fusion', 'variants']",N/A
