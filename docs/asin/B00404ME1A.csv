So sadly, I had no idea what they were saying throughout most of the film. I could not turn the volumne up past 22 living in an apartment. I am sad,because this, I am sure, is a beautifully spoken film. So the ONLY grave mistake with ""The Lightkeepers"",is NO CAPTION. Hard of hearing would be able to ""watch"" this scenic masterpiece.

1378822,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00404ME1A,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[20, 21]","The Lightkeepers is a love story from the bliss of Cape Cod. The story is inspired by a book by Joseph C Lincoln (famous Cape author), ""The Women Haters."" It's about a lighthouse keeper, Seth (Richard Dreyfuss) and his new secretive trainee, assistant, alias John Brown, literal beach flotsam. They are a pair of characters, both women haters, both with secrets connected to females. This is a delightful character driven period (1912 Cape Cod) story. Filmed on the Cape location, it is as scenic as any travelogue, and the music is wonderful too. Hallmark could not have done better. this is a romance set in a time and place that will make your heart drool. A film so pure it bleeds authenticity. PG because the Cape lightkeepers smoke pipes.Their women hater's world is interrupted by 2 ladies appearing for the summer in a neighboring cottage. Ruth Lowell (Mamie Gummer-Meryl Streep's daughter), a rich young girl, is cared for by her housekeeper Mrs. Bascom (Blythe Danner). Of course these women, of similar age to the men, pose a threat to their single gender coastal locale. The women provide some surprise twists to the story and their own characters are a study as worthy as the mens', but much more beautiful. New secrets are enjoined. Some brilliant role playing by these 4 actors.Joining the cast for short spots are Julie Harris, Bruce Dern, and even Ben Dreyfuss as a grocery boy. Yes Ben is Richard Dreyfuss' son.Bonus: TrailerInterviews of R. Dreyfus (9 min) and Writer/director Daniel Adams (5 min)Alas, such a crime it is...NO SDH SUBTITLES or CC. This is a HUGE fault, as this DVD is best suited for the older generations, and some of us can use the subtitles. What were they thinking? No movie of the 21st century should be without subtitles, especially when it markets to the over 30 or 40 or 50.Regardless, my wife and I will watch this one over again and again.

So the lighthouse keeping life seems the perfect answer for both of them.Things go along fine until the day comes when instead of the 2 MEN who usually rent the cabin next door for the summer, 2 WOMEN arrive instead and the women hating lighthouse keepers are in a panic.There are a few surprises in store for them (and for a few others as well).Wonderful performances by all. The shoreline scenery is also a PLUS.Not just a chick flick, I think most guys will enjoy it too (though not if their the type that have to have big action in their movies, or if their taste in humor is immature).It's a very enjoyable movie - I hope you give it a view and find out for yourself. :-)",4,"""Delightful"" romantic comedy even the grandparents will enjoy",1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,1445,"['*****A', 'charming/delightful', 'bit', 'predictable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'could', 'even', 'enjoy', 'parents/grandparents.Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'cantankerous', 'touchy', 'older', 'lighthouse', 'keeper', 'who', 'basically', 'happy', 'hide', 'world', 'especially', 'women', 'hiding', 'big', 'secret.Tom', 'Wisdom', 'young', 'Brit', 'who', 'near', 'drowned', 'up', 'shore', 'one', 'day', 'few', 'secrets', 'own.Dreyfuss', 'just', 'had', 'coworker', 'quit', 'Wisdom', 'interested', 'sticking', 'around', 'so', 'Dreyfuss', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'well', 'anyone', 'probing', 'personal', 'business', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'prying', 'other', 'persons', 'out', 'agree', 'women', 'are', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'strongly', 'want', 'nothing', 'do', 'lighthouse', 'keeping', 'life', 'perfect', 'answer', 'them.Things', 'go', 'along', 'fine', 'day', 'when', 'instead', '2', 'MEN', 'who', 'usually', 'rent', 'cabin', 'next', 'door', 'summer', '2', 'WOMEN', 'arrive', 'instead', 'women', 'hating', 'lighthouse', 'keepers', 'are', 'panic.There', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'store', 'few', 'others', 'as', 'well', '.Wonderful', 'performances', 'shoreline', 'scenery', 'also', 'PLUS.Not', 'just', 'chick', 'flick', 'think', 'most', 'guys', 'will', 'enjoy', 'too', 'not', 'type', 'have', 'have', 'big', 'action', 'movies', 'taste', 'humor', 'immature', '.It', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'hope', 'give', 'view', 'find', 'out']",The Lightkeepers

The story follows an old man (best described as a Popeye character rife with an overindulgence by Dreyfuss - think of his role inLeaves of Grass [Blu-ray] but unintelligible) as he maintains a quaint lighthouse off Cape Cod. Enter a young lad upon his shore and they form an anti-woman bond just in time to have two lady-love-interests occupy a nearby cabin. The performances are fine and mostly tolerable, but you are happy when the film finally finishes.The supplements are almost a parody as Dreyfuss gets interviewed for just over eight minutes - and he only talks about the film for roughly 45 seconds. The remaining interview had people stopping in their tracks as he went on a rant about history, bad Americans, the Constitution and on to population trends of the West Coast. His performance was better in this segment than in the film. The director interview lasts a few moments and he paints everyone glowingly. The BD has nothing to offer though other than a beautiful clear picture. The DTS goes unused, and they included NO subtitles or any additional dubbing. The subtitles were needed with Dreyfuss' accent as his dialogue was not clear throughout.2 for the film, 1 for the BD clarity and .5 for the funniest supplement I have watched that had nothing to do with the film the actor was being interviewed for (granted the lady asking the questions was trying as she tried to get back to the film each time but she gave up towards the end). 97 minutes region coded A.
