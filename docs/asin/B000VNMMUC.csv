It is interesting to see how closely the original radio scripts were followed when turned into a tv version. Dangerous Assignment is among the best radio programs of its type.  The programs hold up surprisingly well considering they were originally written over fifty years ago.A half dozen of the programs are available for free viewing on [...] The quality of these programs is very poor, very difficult to watch. The programs on these  DVDs are a much better quality.Fans of 1950s television will really enjoy these programs.",4,Surprisingly High Quality,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,669,"['Dangerous', 'Assignment', 'was', 'initially', 'radio', 'drama', 'Forty', 'radio', 'dramas', 'were', 'filmed', 'aired', 'TV', 'programs', '1952', 'season', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'closely', 'original', 'radio', 'scripts', 'were', 'followed', 'when', 'turned', 'tv', 'version', 'Dangerous', 'Assignment', 'best', 'radio', 'programs', 'type', 'programs', 'hold', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'considering', 'were', 'originally', 'written', 'over', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago.A', 'dozen', 'programs', 'are', 'available', 'free', 'viewing', '[', 'quality', 'programs', 'very', 'poor', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'programs', 'DVDs', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'quality.Fans', '1950s', 'television', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'programs']",Dangerous Assignment: The Complete Television Collection

I am younger and like old TV series but I recognize how campy this show is as well. Know how younger viewers rip Star Trek for all the Red Shirts dying in the series, well if you grew up on the show you probably never saw it that way until you heard it recently and it's true! Well here the camp factor with Dangerous Assignment is of all the episodes I've seen, all of Steve's allied agents get killed. If the Commissioner said that I was to work with Secret Agent Steve Mitchell, I'd turn in my Secret Agent ID and gun and resign! The production values are good enough so it's still good to watch and whether you are into it, or laugh a little (or a lot), it's all good entertainment. Donlevy is not nearly as ""wooden"" here as many of his critics say of his movies and being a Brian Donlevy fan myself, I enjoy watching this series I had never heard of until recently. Donlevy comes across kind of like an older American Roger Moore's James Bond if you will, and it saves the show as the humor is much needed to make this show still work. The DVD prints are clean by the way with only a trademark brand shown briefly during the intro. 4 of 5 stars.",4,Campy Fun Show,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,1343,"['could', 'be', 'one', 'two', 'different', 'fans', 'show', 'person', 'who', 'fond', 'memories', 'seeing', 'earlier', 'lives', 'younger', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'camp', 'factor', 'series', 'am', 'younger', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'recognize', 'how', 'campy', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'Know', 'how', 'younger', 'viewers', 'rip', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Red', 'Shirts', 'dying', 'series', 'well', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'probably', 'never', 'saw', 'way', 'heard', 'recently', 'true', 'Well', 'here', 'camp', 'factor', 'Dangerous', 'Assignment', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Steve', 'allied', 'agents', 'get', 'killed', 'Commissioner', 'said', 'was', 'work', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'Steve', 'Mitchell', ""'d"", 'turn', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'ID', 'gun', 'resign', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'still', 'good', 'watch', 'are', 'little', 'lot', 'good', 'entertainment', 'Donlevy', 'not', 'nearly', 'wooden', 'here', 'many', 'critics', 'say', 'movies', 'being', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'series', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'recently', 'Donlevy', 'kind', 'older', 'American', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'James', 'Bond', 'will', 'show', 'humor', 'much', 'needed', 'make', 'show', 'still', 'work', 'DVD', 'prints', 'are', 'clean', 'way', 'only', 'trademark', 'brand', 'shown', 'briefly', 'intro', '4', '5', 'stars']",Dangerous Assignment: The Complete Television Collection
1103471,AKZ0VCSGG1YIS,B000VNMMUC,"Stanwyck ""Stanwyck""","[2, 3]","This show is a good example of '50s television.  Its star is Steve Mitchell- who is only identified as a ""Government Agent.""  Steve appears at the beginning of each show is what is obviously a crummy part of town, oddly dressed to the nines- including top hat.  He pauses to smoke a cigarette near a lamppost and suddenly a knife flies in from the right to lodge itself right in front of him.  Of course, we know that Steve in is no real danger because we can see the wire that the knife traveled on.Anyway, Steve is sent all over the world by the ""commissioner"" who briefly appeared at the beginning of some shows, and then was apparently done away with later, leaving Steve to explain his mission to us as he flies to his destination.  It's fortunate that TWA (or AWT if the print was flopped the other way) flew to all these trouble spots because he never flies any other airline.  It was unfortunate that there wasn't a frequent flyer program in effect at the time because Steve could have bought out Howard Hughes' interest in TWA.After Steve lands he immediately is caught up in is mission, which usually involves some shapely blonde.  Sometimes he checks into a hotel, which must be part of a chain because most of the rooms look the same- with louvered doors and odd furniture items like bookshelves- complete with books.  Often he goes to the state police in the other country, who all occupy similar offices with the same furniture.Once in a while Steve goes to the mountains, where he is again placed in peril, but we again know that he's in no real danger, as we can see the seams where the scenery was pasted on the wall.Sometimes Steve goes undercover, and seems to have the good fortune to meet some of the dumbest of foreign police and military personel- except they all speak english- as he makes no attempt to address them in their own language or even adopt an accent.And this being a series- you see the same people over and over- particularly Jim Davis and Lyle Talbot- who alternate as bad guys or good guys depending on the episode.  And, as one of the other reviewers mentioned- being Steve's partner seems to be the kiss of deah, as they are almost invariably bumped off, leaving Steve on his own.See if you can find this series on TV before you buy it- because as initially entertaining as it is- it gets old rapidly.",4,So hokey it's good,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,2343,"['show', 'good', 'example', 'television', 'star', 'Steve', 'Mitchell-', 'who', 'only', 'identified', 'Government', 'Agent', 'Steve', 'beginning', 'show', 'what', 'obviously', 'crummy', 'part', 'town', 'oddly', 'dressed', 'nines-', 'including', 'top', 'hat', 'smoke', 'cigarette', 'lamppost', 'suddenly', 'knife', 'flies', 'right', 'lodge', 'right', 'front', 'course', 'know', 'Steve', 'real', 'danger', 'can', 'see', 'wire', 'knife', 'traveled', 'on.Anyway', 'Steve', 'sent', 'world', 'commissioner', 'who', 'briefly', 'appeared', 'beginning', 'shows', 'then', 'was', 'apparently', 'done', 'away', 'later', 'leaving', 'Steve', 'explain', 'mission', 'destination', 'fortunate', 'TWA', 'AWT', 'print', 'was', 'flopped', 'other', 'way', 'flew', 'trouble', 'spots', 'never', 'other', 'airline', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'was', ""n't"", 'frequent', 'flyer', 'program', 'effect', 'time', 'Steve', 'could', 'have', 'bought', 'out', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'interest', 'TWA.After', 'Steve', 'immediately', 'caught', 'up', 'mission', 'usually', 'shapely', 'blonde', 'Sometimes', 'hotel', 'must', 'be', 'part', 'chain', 'most', 'rooms', 'look', 'same-', 'louvered', 'doors', 'odd', 'furniture', 'items', 'bookshelves-', 'complete', 'books', 'state', 'police', 'other', 'country', 'who', 'occupy', 'similar', 'offices', 'same', 'furniture.Once', 'while', 'Steve', 'mountains', 'where', 'again', 'placed', 'peril', 'again', 'know', 'real', 'danger', 'can', 'see', 'seams', 'where', 'scenery', 'was', 'pasted', 'wall.Sometimes', 'Steve', 'undercover', 'have', 'good', 'fortune', 'meet', 'dumbest', 'foreign', 'police', 'military', 'personel-', 'speak', 'english-', 'attempt', 'address', 'own', 'language', 'even', 'adopt', 'accent.And', 'being', 'series-', 'see', 'same', 'people', 'over-', 'particularly', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'Lyle', 'Talbot-', 'who', 'alternate', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys', 'depending', 'episode', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned-', 'being', 'Steve', 'partner', 'be', 'kiss', 'deah', 'are', 'almost', 'invariably', 'bumped', 'off', 'leaving', 'Steve', 'own.See', 'can', 'find', 'series', 'TV', 'buy', 'it-', 'initially', 'entertaining', 'old', 'rapidly']",Dangerous Assignment: The Complete Television Collection
1103472,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000VNMMUC,trebe,"[20, 20]","Brian Donlevy is US agent Steve Mitchell, in producer Harold Knox's Dangerous Assignment, a suspenseful TV series that ran during the 1952-1953 season.  Most episodes start in Washington DC, where Mitchell, who works for an unspecified agency, drops in at the office of `The Commissioner' to be briefed about his latest assignment.  And then he's off, usually to some exotic foreign location, at the far corner of the world.  Europe, the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America and the Far East, are just a few of the places that Mitchell assignments take him to.  Often when taking a flight, Mitchell provides a narrative regarding his upcoming mission, or at other times he comments on his current status.Mitchell is competent and thoroughly professional, and he needs to be, as he is almost always in unfamiliar territory.  At his destination, there is usually someone he is to contact, to either get help or information.  Things sometimes unfold like a detective story, and other times events happen like an adventure.  Mitchell, in his 50's, isn't flashy or a great fighter, he relies on his wits and a keen eye for detail, to develop and follow leads.  The tone is almost always serious, and Mitchell appears a little stiff at times, almost always dressed a suit.  The opposition is clever, and for all his skills, Mitchell is baffled or misled at times, and gets coshed on the head more than a few times.  Still, he usually finds a pretty credible way to come out on top.Overall, this series is entertaining and very well-written.  The stories are usually gritty and mostly believable.  Mitchell appears in many situations and locations, which helps keep things interesting.  He may not be the most charismatic fellow, but Mitchell gets the job done without any gimmicks or gadgets.  His fights are usually very short, and he rarely uses a gun, or has to kill someone.  The series may be seen as too ancient or slow, by those accustomed to the modern James Bond style of intrigue.Dangerous Assignment was first a NBC radio program (1949-53), with Donlevy as Steve Mitchell.  Donlevy worked to bring the program to the then new medium, television.  Utilizing some of the same creative team, the TV show is quite similar to the radio program, in the type of stories, style of presentation, and even the same theme music.  Some radio episodes were adapted for the screen, and Herb Butterworth who was The Commissioner on the radio show, also appeared in the role a few times on the TV program.  Making several appearances in various minor roles is Jim Davis (Dallas).",5,from radio to television . . .,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,2578,"['Brian', 'Donlevy', 'US', 'agent', 'Steve', 'Mitchell', 'producer', 'Harold', 'Knox', 'Dangerous', 'Assignment', 'suspenseful', 'TV', 'series', 'ran', '1952-1953', 'season', 'Most', 'episodes', 'start', 'Washington', 'DC', 'where', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'unspecified', 'agency', 'drops', 'office', 'Commissioner', 'be', 'briefed', 'latest', 'assignment', 'then', 'off', 'usually', 'exotic', 'foreign', 'location', 'far', 'corner', 'world', 'Europe', 'Middle', 'East', 'Africa', 'South', 'Central', 'America', 'Far', 'East', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'places', 'Mitchell', 'assignments', 'take', 'Often', 'when', 'taking', 'flight', 'Mitchell', 'narrative', 'regarding', 'upcoming', 'mission', 'other', 'times', 'comments', 'current', 'status.Mitchell', 'competent', 'thoroughly', 'professional', 'be', 'almost', 'always', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'destination', 'usually', 'someone', 'contact', 'get', 'help', 'information', 'Things', 'sometimes', 'unfold', 'detective', 'story', 'other', 'times', 'events', 'happen', 'adventure', 'Mitchell', '50', ""n't"", 'flashy', 'great', 'fighter', 'wits', 'keen', 'eye', 'detail', 'develop', 'follow', 'leads', 'tone', 'almost', 'always', 'serious', 'Mitchell', 'little', 'stiff', 'times', 'almost', 'always', 'dressed', 'suit', 'opposition', 'clever', 'skills', 'Mitchell', 'baffled', 'misled', 'times', 'coshed', 'head', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'Still', 'usually', 'pretty', 'credible', 'way', 'come', 'out', 'top.Overall', 'series', 'entertaining', 'very', 'well-written', 'stories', 'are', 'usually', 'gritty', 'mostly', 'believable', 'Mitchell', 'many', 'situations', 'locations', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'charismatic', 'fellow', 'Mitchell', 'job', 'done', 'gimmicks', 'gadgets', 'fights', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'short', 'rarely', 'gun', 'kill', 'someone', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'too', 'ancient', 'slow', 'accustomed', 'modern', 'James', 'Bond', 'style', 'intrigue.Dangerous', 'Assignment', 'was', 'first', 'NBC', 'radio', 'program', '1949-53', 'Donlevy', 'Steve', 'Mitchell', 'Donlevy', 'worked', 'bring', 'program', 'then', 'new', 'medium', 'television', 'Utilizing', 'same', 'creative', 'team', 'TV', 'show', 'quite', 'similar', 'radio', 'program', 'type', 'stories', 'style', 'presentation', 'even', 'same', 'theme', 'music', 'radio', 'episodes', 'were', 'adapted', 'screen', 'Herb', 'Butterworth', 'who', 'was', 'Commissioner', 'radio', 'show', 'also', 'appeared', 'role', 'few', 'times', 'TV', 'program', 'Making', 'several', 'appearances', 'various', 'minor', 'roles', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'Dallas']",Dangerous Assignment: The Complete Television Collection
