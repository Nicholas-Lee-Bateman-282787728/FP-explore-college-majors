I have seen him live with my girlfriend and she was there when I put it in and thought it was almost better than the real show. If you enjoy him, this is a great DVD to just put in and relax to or have playing in the background.",5,BB is still the King,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,331,"['Got', 'dvd', 'threw', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'worked', 'well', 'etc', 'just', 'was', 'amazed', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'there', 'when', 'put', 'thought', 'was', 'almost', 'better', 'real', 'show', 'enjoy', 'great', 'DVD', 'just', 'put', 'relax', 'have', 'playing', 'background']",N/A
773817,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B0000C826G,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","This particular show was part of a series presented by the A&E; Network where a singer was featured, they take phone calls for requests between songs and the emcee handles that and a short interview here and there.The best feature about having this on DVD is that you can skip all the talking and go directly to the next chapter each time where each song begins. The music is good, too. B.B. King's voice is getting a bit raspy after all these years but his guitar playing is still excellent and I liked the selection of songs on this disc. Most of them are entertaining, even the slower ones.The concert really takes off when Jeff Beck enters for a few numbers with B.B. Beck shows a great deal of guitar virtuosity and is fun to watch and the songs are very up tempo.All in all, a satisfying hour-plus of good blues music that should put you in a good mood.  Just skip all the talk.",5,Satisfying Hour Of Blues,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,884,"['particular', 'show', 'was', 'part', 'series', 'presented', 'A', 'E', 'Network', 'where', 'singer', 'was', 'featured', 'take', 'phone', 'calls', 'requests', 'songs', 'emcee', 'short', 'interview', 'here', 'there.The', 'best', 'feature', 'having', 'DVD', 'can', 'skip', 'talking', 'go', 'directly', 'next', 'chapter', 'time', 'where', 'song', 'music', 'good', 'too', 'B.B', 'King', 'voice', 'getting', 'bit', 'raspy', 'years', 'guitar', 'playing', 'still', 'excellent', 'liked', 'selection', 'songs', 'disc', 'Most', 'are', 'entertaining', 'even', 'slower', 'ones.The', 'concert', 'really', 'off', 'when', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'enters', 'few', 'numbers', 'B.B', 'Beck', 'great', 'deal', 'guitar', 'virtuosity', 'fun', 'watch', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'up', 'tempo.All', 'satisfying', 'hour-plus', 'good', 'blues', 'music', 'should', 'put', 'good', 'mood', 'Just', 'skip', 'talk']",N/A

BB is not free to chat with the audience, tell jokes or anything.  He is restricted to sitting by the phone and taking calls, and playing whatever they tell him to.  Of course, the music is still very good, and BB is still the best blues guitarists ever, but this is not his best performance.  Get ""Jazz Channel Presents"" to see a better representation of BB's live performances.",3,Good songs but none of BB's personality,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,505,"['whole', 'performance', 'stiff', 'almost', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'studio', 'session', 'not', 'live', 'concert', 'BB', 'not', 'free', 'chat', 'audience', 'tell', 'jokes', 'anything', 'restricted', 'sitting', 'phone', 'taking', 'calls', 'playing', 'tell', 'course', 'music', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'BB', 'still', 'best', 'blues', 'guitarists', 'ever', 'not', 'best', 'performance', 'Get', 'Jazz', 'Channel', 'Presents', 'see', 'better', 'representation', 'BB', 'live', 'performances']",N/A
773819,A1I92IME77MNKL,B0000C826G,Mitchell Lopate,"[9, 13]","Let's clear the air on some issues: B.B. King is not the best guitar player in the world. He can't sing and play at the same time--and he has said so.But what he does so well--and what makes him a musical and national legend--is that he has SUCH control of his rapport with his audience, his band, and his phrasing. I've NEVER seen anyone wiggle that much vibrato so effortlessly out of a string as B.B. does.  Furthermore, he has a wonderful bullhorn of a voice that just comes up from the depths of that large belly (yes, B.B., you're round like a prize pumpkin), but he uses his singing to caress and grind as necessary. He's 80 years old now, and for what it's worth, if vocal cord muscles were a sign of strength and manhood, he's as much a stud as ever. You can see his eyes are getting a bit rheumy, but there's wisdom in them. And he's as charming a storyteller as you'd want to hear.Musically, he just holds command like royalty up there in that chair--and the band is tight-tight-tight as the slightest quiver of Lucille's strings tell them where and how to go. And friends--the man has the world of musicians to call on when he wants them. This time, he's pulled the fiery Jeff Beck up onstage, and for the simple price of this disc, the camera followed where it should. Beck's thumbnail picking and riffing are an invaluable lesson in themselves for anyone who's tried to learn lead lines with a blues touch. You might have to remind someone who's watching this that when the show's over, they can close their mouth and get over the awe of the show. But don't blame them for being so blown away: when B.B. King and friends like Jeff take on something like a request night, the thrill will never be gone.",5,B.B's the King forever,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,1715,"['Let', 'clear', 'air', 'issues', 'B.B', 'King', 'not', 'best', 'guitar', 'player', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'play', 'same', 'time', 'said', 'so.But', 'what', 'so', 'well', 'what', 'musical', 'national', 'legend', 'SUCH', 'control', 'rapport', 'audience', 'band', 'phrasing', ""'ve"", 'NEVER', 'seen', 'anyone', 'wiggle', 'much', 'vibrato', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'string', 'B.B', 'Furthermore', 'wonderful', 'bullhorn', 'voice', 'just', 'up', 'depths', 'large', 'belly', 'yes', 'B.B.', ""'re"", 'round', 'prize', 'pumpkin', 'singing', 'caress', 'grind', 'necessary', '80', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'what', 'worth', 'vocal', 'cord', 'muscles', 'were', 'sign', 'strength', 'manhood', 'as', 'much', 'stud', 'ever', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'are', 'getting', 'bit', 'rheumy', 'wisdom', 'charming', 'storyteller', ""'d"", 'want', 'hear.Musically', 'just', 'command', 'royalty', 'up', 'there', 'chair', 'band', 'tight-tight-tight', 'slightest', 'quiver', 'Lucille', 'strings', 'tell', 'where', 'how', 'go', 'friends', 'man', 'world', 'musicians', 'call', 'when', 'time', 'pulled', 'fiery', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'up', 'onstage', 'simple', 'price', 'disc', 'camera', 'followed', 'where', 'should', 'Beck', 'thumbnail', 'picking', 'riffing', 'are', 'invaluable', 'lesson', 'anyone', 'who', 'tried', 'learn', 'lead', 'lines', 'blues', 'touch', 'might', 'have', 'remind', 'someone', 'who', 'watching', 'when', 'show', 'over', 'can', 'close', 'mouth', 'get', 'awe', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'being', 'so', 'blown', 'away', 'when', 'B.B', 'King', 'friends', 'Jeff', 'take', 'something', 'request', 'night', 'thrill', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'gone']",N/A
