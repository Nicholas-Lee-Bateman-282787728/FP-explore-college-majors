565708,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,B000053VAY,"Daniel S. ""Daniel""","[12, 13]","Written, produced and directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, SUTURE is undoubtedly one of the most interesting movies I have seen so far this year. Shot in black and white in 1993, this unusual thriller deserves to be rediscovered in the DVD standard since it didn't find its audience when it was theatrically released.The nervous tension felt by the viewer while watching a movie is generally produced by two simple narrative methods. For instance, the director can decide that the audience will always be kept literally behind the main character, never knowing what will appear next on the screen. In this case, we are manipulated by the director who can easily shock us with unexpected scenes. This method is principally used by horror movies directors. Another way for a director to create tension among the audience is, on the contrary, to give us informations the characters of the movie are unaware of. Just think of all the scenes you have already seen involving a young woman coming home alone while you are aware that there is a serial killer hidden in her apartment.Scott McGehee and David Siegel have invented, in my opinion, a third narrative method that is going to greatly disturb you. In SUTURE, the characters of the movie DON'T see what you see. For us, the audience, Clay Arlington is a colored guy from the suburbs of Needle, Arizona played by Dennis Haysbert - a colored actor - but for the characters of SUTURE, Clay Arlington is a white guy having a tremendous resemblance with Vincent Towers played by the caucasian Michal Harris. Are you still with me ?So you spend half the movie wondering why you are the only one noticing that Vincent Towers and Clay Arlington don't have the slightest resemblance. It's very disturbing and, I must admit, a genial idea. SUTURE is also a movie you can speak about during hours with friends because it's smart, filled with references and artistically perfect.This MGM DVD presents, apart of the widescreen version of SUTURE, a theatrical trailer and french subtitles.

565712,A1MCGG7A9G93YI,B000053VAY,John Galvin,"[5, 5]","""How is it that we know who we are?"" These are the opening words of the film Suture, delivered in voice-over by Dr Shimoda. He starts at a violent twist near the conclusion--which gives an unexpected answer to his question--but then decides that it would be better to start a little nearer to the beginning. So we fade to Clay Arlington stepping off a bus to be greeted by his estranged half-brother, Vincent Towers. Vincent and Clay, it would seem, are almost physically indistinguishable--a fact which had inspired Vincent to invite Clay to pay him a visit. It seems they saw one another for the first time at the funeral of their father whom Vincent is suspected of having murdered. And Vincent now plans to kill Clay whom he hopes will be mistaken for himself. Clay miraculously survives though both mind and body are shattered. Plastic surgeon Renee Descartes will reconstruct his face; psychotherapist Shimoda will reconstruct his identity. Unfortunately, they, like everyone else, believe him to be Vincent and so, little by little, fit him into the mind and body of his brother. Pictures, videos and reminiscences with a relative supply Clay with pieces of a puzzle that are shaped like his own but which, once in place, paint a very different picture.Clay was working-class; Vincent, a rich dilettante. Clay was warm, earnest and unassuming; Vincent, cold, deceitful and calculating. They were really very different people, as different as night and day. In fact, the differences in their characters are so pronounced they actually manifest themselves physically. The actor playing Clay is tall, beefy and black while the actor playing Vincent--his near twin--is short, thin and white. Elements of the dialog are then very much at odds with the visuals that receive, in turn, even greater thematic focus through the brilliantly articulated contrasts of the black and white cinematography. In the end, you are presented with some rather interesting, if perplexing, questions about the puzzle of identity: what does it mean to remember someone else's past? to graft bits and pieces of one life onto the withered remains of another? to eventually mistake oneself for the self of another? Who exactly have you become? Who should you want to become? Clay's answer is an uncomfortable surprise and Dr Shimoda can only wonder, finally, ""How is it that we know who we are?""",4,Suture: remembering someone eslse's past,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,2374,"['How', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'opening', 'words', 'film', 'Suture', 'delivered', 'voice-over', 'Dr', 'Shimoda', 'violent', 'twist', 'conclusion', 'unexpected', 'answer', 'question', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'start', 'little', 'nearer', 'beginning', 'fade', 'Clay', 'Arlington', 'stepping', 'off', 'bus', 'be', 'greeted', 'estranged', 'half-brother', 'Vincent', 'Towers', 'Vincent', 'Clay', 'would', 'seem', 'are', 'almost', 'physically', 'indistinguishable', 'fact', 'had', 'inspired', 'Vincent', 'invite', 'Clay', 'pay', 'visit', 'saw', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'funeral', 'father', 'whom', 'Vincent', 'suspected', 'having', 'murdered', 'Vincent', 'now', 'kill', 'Clay', 'whom', 'will', 'be', 'mistaken', 'Clay', 'miraculously', 'mind', 'body', 'are', 'shattered', 'Plastic', 'surgeon', 'Renee', 'Descartes', 'will', 'reconstruct', 'face', 'psychotherapist', 'Shimoda', 'will', 'reconstruct', 'identity', 'Unfortunately', 'everyone', 'else', 'believe', 'be', 'Vincent', 'so', 'little', 'little', 'fit', 'mind', 'body', 'brother', 'Pictures', 'videos', 'reminiscences', 'relative', 'supply', 'Clay', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'are', 'shaped', 'own', 'once', 'place', 'paint', 'very', 'different', 'picture.Clay', 'was', 'working-class', 'Vincent', 'rich', 'dilettante', 'Clay', 'was', 'warm', 'earnest', 'unassuming', 'Vincent', 'cold', 'deceitful', 'calculating', 'were', 'really', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day', 'fact', 'differences', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'pronounced', 'actually', 'manifest', 'physically', 'actor', 'playing', 'Clay', 'tall', 'beefy', 'black', 'actor', 'playing', 'Vincent', 'near', 'twin', 'short', 'thin', 'white', 'Elements', 'dialog', 'are', 'then', 'very', 'much', 'odds', 'visuals', 'receive', 'turn', 'even', 'greater', 'thematic', 'focus', 'brilliantly', 'articulated', 'contrasts', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'end', 'are', 'presented', 'rather', 'interesting', 'perplexing', 'questions', 'puzzle', 'identity', 'what', 'mean', 'remember', 'someone', 'else', 'past', 'graft', 'bits', 'pieces', 'one', 'life', 'withered', 'remains', 'eventually', 'mistake', 'self', 'Who', 'exactly', 'have', 'become', 'Who', 'should', 'want', 'become', 'Clay', 'answer', 'uncomfortable', 'surprise', 'Dr', 'Shimoda', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'finally', 'How', 'know', 'who', 'are']",N/A
565713,A2JOELPDZIQR7D,B000053VAY,Matthew Parks,"[10, 11]","Suture is an experimental film masquerading as a vintage 50's film noir crime drama. Basically, the plot hinges on two brothers (one played by a white actor, one by a black actor), one of whom tries to kill the other, in order assume the other brother's identity to conceal his criminal past. His brother survives, but has amnesia, and must piece together his life before it is too late. The movie does a masterful job of telling the story from a series of shifting and fractured points of view. This, combined with the fact that the brothers, who are played by actors of different races, are frequently confused with on another, results in a uniquely surreal reimagining of the conventional crime noir.",5,Suture,980640000,"01 28, 2001",2001,703,"['Suture', 'experimental', 'film', 'masquerading', 'vintage', '50', 'film', 'noir', 'crime', 'drama', 'Basically', 'plot', 'hinges', 'two', 'brothers', 'one', 'played', 'white', 'actor', 'one', 'black', 'actor', 'one', 'whom', 'tries', 'kill', 'other', 'order', 'assume', 'other', 'brother', 'identity', 'conceal', 'criminal', 'past', 'brother', 'survives', 'amnesia', 'must', 'piece', 'together', 'life', 'too', 'late', 'movie', 'masterful', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'series', 'shifting', 'fractured', 'points', 'view', 'combined', 'fact', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'played', 'actors', 'different', 'races', 'are', 'frequently', 'confused', 'results', 'uniquely', 'surreal', 'reimagining', 'conventional', 'crime', 'noir']",N/A
565714,A2H4SX356GPXHS,B000053VAY,Phil Wernig,"[1, 1]","""How is it that we know who we are?"" Doctor Shinoda poses the question in darkness as ""Suture"" begins. The dark is as important as the light that will constitute the other half of the film, shot in black and white of searing contrasts. We recognize from the opening moments that ""Suture"" will be about identity, polarity and opposition.Clay Arlington (Dennis Haysbert) has been summoned to Phoenix, Arizona by his half-brother Vincent Towers (Michael Harris). Sharing a wealthy father, they had met only once previously - at their father's funeral. Clay does not know why his brother has insisted on a visit. He is working class, easy-going, and eager to connect with his blood kin, who meets him at the bus station in a gleaming white suit and brilliant white Bentley.In their personalities and in their fate, Clay and Vincent are polar opposites. Clay has been starved of opportunity; Vincent suffers from a surfeit of it. He has lived in luxury's lap, but has neglected to nourish his soul. He has no friends. Solicitous Mrs. Jameson, a family acquaintance with long standing designs on Vincent, describes him as ""a very sensitive person"" who has lived ""a very tumultuous life."" Vincent has inherited his father's fortune. He has hastened the process by murdering him.Unalike in temperament, the brothers agree at once that they are remarkably alike in appearance, although Vincent's complexion is as pale as the ghost of Hamlet's father and Clay's is as dark as an unlit coal mine. ""Our physical similarity is disarming, isn't it?"" Vincent notes. Vincent, however, is very much armed. So is the Bentley, wired with a remote controlled bomb with which Vincent will attempt to assassinate his brother.Vincent's home, an overwhelming structure of antiseptic modernity, is as unfurnished as his inner life. White shrouds cover vague shapes, white drapes, lamps, tiles, and curtains lend the interior the chilly feel of a recent snowstorm. In this desolate house of conspicuous riches, as in every scene, every costume, every landscape, and every background, blacks and whites oppose each other harshly, imposing a sustained tenor of disquieting division.Detective Wiseman of the local police is on Vincent's trail. Banking on Clay's physical similarity to fake his own death, Vincent plants his own identification on his brother, sends him off in the Bentley, and detonates the bomb.In his ""Discourse On The Method"" of 1637 Rene Descartes wrote, ""Give me motion and extension and I will construct the world.""Doctor Renee Descartes (Mel Harris), a plastic surgeon, undertakes the reconstruction of Clay Arlington, who has survived the car bomb. Where better to rise from the ashes than in Phoenix? She joshes with Doctor Shinoda (Sab Shimono), ""I can fix the body, but when it comes to the electrical system, it's beyond me."" Clay has lost his memory. He does not know that he is not Vincent Towers. He only knows that everyone else believes he is Vincent and that the police suspect him of murder. Doctor Shinoda is the psychiatrist assigned to help him recover his memory. ""You have created your own amnesia,"" he informs his patient. Clay is to be molded.In his austere office, decorated with intimidating floor-to-ceiling Rorschach blots, Doctor Shinoda teases out Clay's memory with dry assurances, bland quotations from Auden, Freud and Shakespeare, and dream analysis.Doctor Descartes has better results in the reconstruction of Clay's face and the recovery of his personality. Over the course of his treatment, they fall in love. It becomes increasingly difficult for her to believe that her patient is a murderer. He is warm, humble, accessible, sincere. Everyone at the hospital adores him. Only Detective Wiseman doubts.Staff and patients, in white lab coats and hospital garb, demonstrate their affection by throwing him a birthday party. Clay/Vincent is a Gemini. Of course.Doctor Descartes sees evidence of Clay's innocence in his facial features. She collects books on physiognomy - the practice of divining human proclivities from surface appearances. She finds aesthetic aptitude in his ""Greco-Roman nose""; his ""fine, straight hair"" is proof of his ""good mental temperament."" In fact, his nose is broad and flat, no more ""Greco-Roman"" than a Hottentot's; his hair is coarse and curly. Doctor Descartes has accepted that he is Vincent, whom she knows only from a photo, a stern portrait painting in his home, and a videotape shot by Mrs. Jameson of Vincent at his father's last birthday party.Clay eventually decrypts the images from his dreams that suggest he is not Vincent Towers; nevertheless he embraces his new identity with all its perquisites and its dangers.Will Detective Wiseman discover sufficient evidence to convict him of murder? Will the real Vincent return to finish his botched assassination? Will the stitches of Doctor Descartes' love and surgery restore Clay/Vincent to seamless integrity?Descartes opened his ""Discourse"" with the proposition, ""I think, therefore I am."" He did not mean this in the sense of ""I think I am Vincent Towers, therefore I am Vincent Towers."" Descartes anchored existence in cogitation because he wished to locate the mind on a spiritual plane separate from the body and consonant with a soul that participates in eternity and receives its truths directly from God. In opposition, he posited a material world, created by God, which operates by itself without divine agency like a well-built watch.Written, produced and directed in tandem by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, ""Suture"" is a cleverly realized, starkly polarized meditation. The music by Cary Berger is suitably somber, featuring pieces by Wagner, Brahms, Haydn, and Puccini in addition to his original score.The plot does not proceed directly from the Cartesian proposition, but it dangles from it tantalizingly. Like Descartes' material world, ""Suture"" invites our analysis and appreciation of its divinely constructed machinery.",4,Cartesian Identity Crisis,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,5954,"['How', 'know',

Lo and behold it came on today! Moreover, I just noticed Amazon carries a DVD that I simply have to include in my collection.Had it not been for the obvious twist, this would simply have passed as a predictable crime drama involving one brother trying to pass off the responsibility and consequence of one of his own crimes on to the other.The twist is that one of the brothers cast is black.
