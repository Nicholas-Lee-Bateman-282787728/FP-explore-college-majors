I believe it was #8, and I'd never heard of it, so I tracked down a few episodes.The dark music grabbed me instantly, and the bizarre art and animation grabbed me a few seconds later.  It took a few minutes for the unique characters to join in.  And then the surreal humor and incredible plotting.  Excellent action.  And then the sheer daringness of the animation styling.  The main characters are ...Zim - Alien, given a mission to conquer EarthGir - His not so trusty robot sidekick.Dib - A genius human boy who is on to Zim's plan.Gaz - Dib's sister.Red - Zim's boss, the almighty Tallest (with Purple)For example, one episode not on this DVD -- Zim Eats Waffles.  In this minimalist cartoon, there is a hidden camera in Zim's house, and virtually the entire episode is shown from Dib's desk, who is watching the hidden camera from his computer screen. When Zim is about to announce his latest evil plan, he is interrupted by Gir serving waffles.  In the commentary, the writer and director mention that they weren't sure they could pull it off (a single location cartoon), but it worked.Virtually everything in the whole series worked, which is why is clawed its way to the top of the tv.com ratings.  But don't buy the DVD quite yet -- find and watch an Invader Zim episode online.  It's not difficult to find one.  Within a few minutes, you should know if the show is for you or not.  I just just checked that, and wound up finding ""The Fry Cook What Came From All Space"" -- and could not stop watching.  I've seen that episode multiple times, but it grabbed me once again.So, I'm in.  I'm a huge fan of truly great shows, and this is one of them.  If sufficient sales are enough to bring this show back, I'll add in my voice.  Please buy this DVD.If you're not convinced yet, but you watched an episode somewhere, go watch another episode.  You'll eventually be back.",5,A twisted work of genius,1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,1970,"['was', 'clued', 'show', 'when', 'saw', 'tv.com', 'list', 'top-rated', 'shows', 'time', 'believe', 'was', '8', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'so', 'tracked', 'down', 'few', 'episodes.The', 'dark', 'music', 'grabbed', 'instantly', 'bizarre', 'art', 'animation', 'grabbed', 'few', 'seconds', 'later', 'took', 'few', 'minutes', 'unique', 'characters', 'join', 'then', 'surreal', 'humor', 'incredible', 'plotting', 'Excellent', 'action', 'then', 'sheer', 'daringness', 'animation', 'styling', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Zim', 'Alien', 'given', 'mission', 'conquer', 'EarthGir', 'not', 'so', 'trusty', 'robot', 'sidekick.Dib', 'genius', 'human', 'boy', 'who', 'Zim', 'plan.Gaz', 'Dib', 'sister.Red', 'Zim', 'boss', 'almighty', 'Tallest', 'Purple', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'not', 'DVD', 'Zim', 'Eats', 'Waffles', 'minimalist', 'cartoon', 'hidden', 'camera', 'Zim', 'house', 'virtually', 'entire', 'episode', 'shown', 'Dib', 'desk', 'who', 'watching', 'hidden', 'camera', 'computer', 'screen', 'When', 'Zim', 'announce', 'latest', 'evil', 'plan', 'interrupted', 'Gir', 'serving', 'waffles', 'commentary', 'writer', 'director', 'mention', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'single', 'location', 'cartoon', 'worked.Virtually', 'everything', 'whole', 'series', 'worked', 'why', 'clawed', 'way', 'top', 'tv.com', 'ratings', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'quite', 'yet', 'find', 'watch', 'Invader', 'Zim', 'episode', 'online', 'not', 'difficult', 'find', 'one', 'few', 'minutes', 'should', 'know', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'just', 'checked', 'wound', 'up', 'finding', 'Fry', 'Cook', 'What', 'Came', 'From', 'All', 'Space', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'multiple', 'times', 'grabbed', 'once', 'again.So', ""'m"", ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'truly', 'great', 'shows', 'one', 'sufficient', 'sales', 'are', 'enough', 'bring', 'show', 'back', ""'ll"", 'add', 'voice', 'Please', 'buy', 'DVD.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'convinced', 'yet', 'watched', 'episode', 'somewhere', 'go', 'watch', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'be', 'back']",Invader Zim: Operation Doom

But the people behind Invader Zim made it pretty clear how much they did not like working for Nickelodeon because of all the restrictions put on them. I mean, would you like pouring your heart and soul into one episode for the better part of a year only for some prick in a suit to tell you it wouldn't be aired? They hired the mastermind behind Johnny The Homicidal Maniac - did they expect cutesy?Odds are if the show came back, it would not be by the original creators and cast, meaning it would suck. I think this is just an attempt by Nick to line their wallets a little thicker because they know Zim has a cult following that was augmented by them taking it off the air. Look at the DVD cover - it's not even Mr. Vasquez's art. He has a distinct style and what I see on that video case is not his doing. This DVD is good for folks who don't have the box set or who want to ""try"" the show first. Then again, there aren't really any bad episodes.I had my hopes up thinking this was never-before-seen material, like the episode with the infamous blood-stained GIR or maybe an explanation of where Mini-Moose came from (notice how he just kind of showed up out of nowhere in the final episode?

With the added bonus of some clever science fiction concepts and designs, ""Invader Zim"" is easily the most original cartoon I've seen in a long time.This DVD - essentially a ""Best of"" collection of sorts - contains some stellar episodes from a series of such high quality that there really aren't any ""bad"" episodes to begin with.  I'll admit, though, that I'm a tad disappointed that this DVD is missing my all-time favorite Zim episode, ""Dark Harvest.""  Nevertheless, the episodes included are all fantastic.If you already own the complete series in any of its incarnations, this DVD doesn't give you anything new to enjoy (except the box art).  However, this would make a fantastic gift for anyone who loves the show but doesn't own it, or as a means of introducing people to the show without risking the safety of your DVDs in someone else's hands.Bottom line: Whether buying as a gift or for yourself (and regardless of whether increase sales means new episodes), this DVD is a nearly perfect collection of episodes from an incredibly entertaining yet short-lived series.",5,"Clever, Unique, and Entertaining",1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,1340,"['Ignoring', 'impassioned', 'pleas', 'superfans', 'better', 'sales', 'DVD', 'better', 'likelihood', 'show', 'return', 'should', 'STILL', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Invader', 'Zim', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'silly', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'smart', 'sense', 'humor', 'added', 'bonus', 'clever', 'science', 'fiction', 'concepts', 'designs', 'Invader', 'Zim', 'easily', 'most', 'original', 'cartoon', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.This', 'DVD', 'essentially', 'Best', 'collection', 'sorts', 'stellar', 'episodes', 'series', 'such', 'high', 'quality', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'episodes', 'begin', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'though', ""'m"", 'tad', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'missing', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Zim', 'episode', 'Dark', 'Harvest', 'Nevertheless', 'episodes', 'included', 'are', 'fantastic.If', 'already', 'own', 'complete', 'series', 'incarnations', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'new', 'enjoy', 'box', 'art', 'However', 'would', 'make', 'fantastic', 'gift', 'anyone', 'who', 'show', ""n't"", 'own', 'means', 'introducing', 'people', 'show', 'risking', 'safety', 'DVDs', 'someone', 'else', 'hands.Bottom', 'line', 'buying', 'gift', 'regardless', 'increase', 'sales', 'new', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'collection', 'episodes', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'short-lived', 'series']",Invader Zim: Operation Doom
