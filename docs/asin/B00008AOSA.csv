Ryan Gosling is unbelievably effective as a man who hates his weaknesses so much that he turns his hate outward towards the hate of his nation and his religion.

What Ryan Gosling does here is outstanding.  Taking a character that is easy to hate and even easier to stereotypicalize (I just made up a word, I know), Gosling attributes so many layers to this character that it becomes so much bigger than one would think.  Taking a monster and dissecting him so that we can humanize him and understand him and his plight and the realities behind his actions was a remarkable feat that took a genius actor to accomplish.Ryan Gosling is a genius.`The Believer' is a film about a young Jewish man who turns his back on his heritage to take up the hatred of the Nazi's.  That young man is Daniel Balint.  Daniel loathes himself and where he comes from with such extreme misunderstanding that he is willing to throw his individuality away in his search for self-worth.  That is what I love so much about `The Believer', for it is a film that understands the intricacies of Daniel's actions.  With each flashback, rich with character development, and every misapplied statement, `The Believer' fleshes out every angle of Daniel's personality and what makes him so misguided.  As Daniel strays even further from his `person', indulging in bad associates and falsified allegations, you can see the confusion lacing his face as he struggles with the inner desire to return to his roots, to find his home.This is the story of a man who needed to find himself; one way or another.Ryan Gosling completely owns this film, but he is aided by some sincere performances; most notably that of Summer Phoenix (yes, Joaquin and River's sister and wife to Casey Affleck) who plays Daniel's troubled girlfriend.Henry Bean penned a stunning directorial debut here.

It looks small whenever lead Ryan Gosling is off the screen.  But, thankfully, that's only for a few minutes.  Because when he's on, the sheer raw intensity and magnetism of his performance fairly leaps off the set.  This is an incredible performance.Gosling's Danny Balint sells his demented thinking with such fervor and absolutism that he wins over follower after follower.  There's a great little pastiche of scenes where Balint speaks to a small group. You see three, four of these gatherings.  They're arranged chronologically.  Each time, the crowd grows.  The word is obviously getting out about Balint and his spellbinding oratory.  That's great work by director Henry Bean.As noted by other reviewers, the seminal scene in the film is when Danny lovingly protects the Torah as his fellow travelers trash a synagouge.  Bean has done a wonderful job setting up a collison course - Balint's virulent, self-loathing anti-Semitism vs. the incultated, Othrodox beliefs and practices of his youth.  The Torah scene is where it comes to a head.  Knowing the 'The Believer' is based on a true story makes it all the more affecting.",5,"Ryan Gosling - wow, what a performance",1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,1248,"[""'The"", 'Believer', ""'small-budget"", 'film', 'written', 'presence', 'Titanic', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'notwithstanding', 'small', 'whenever', 'lead', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'screen', 'thankfully', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'when', 'sheer', 'raw', 'intensity', 'magnetism', 'performance', 'fairly', 'set', 'incredible', 'performance.Gosling', 'Danny', 'Balint', 'demented', 'thinking', 'such', 'fervor', 'absolutism', 'over', 'follower', 'follower', 'great', 'little', 'pastiche', 'scenes', 'where', 'Balint', 'small', 'group', 'see', 'three', 'four', 'gatherings', ""'re"", 'arranged', 'chronologically', 'time', 'crowd', 'word', 'obviously', 'getting', 'out', 'Balint', 'spellbinding', 'oratory', 'great', 'work', 'director', 'Henry', 'Bean.As', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'seminal', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Danny', 'lovingly', 'Torah', 'fellow', 'travelers', 'trash', 'synagouge', 'Bean', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'collison', 'course', 'Balint', 'virulent', 'self-loathing', 'anti-Semitism', 'incultated', 'Othrodox', 'beliefs', 'practices', 'youth', 'Torah', 'scene', 'where', 'head', 'Knowing', ""'The"", 'Believer', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'more', 'affecting']",N/A
737062,A2VMT89TCSF105,B00008AOSA,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[1, 6]","Apparently I didn't get it, since all the other reviews are so glowing. Personally, I found ""The Believer"" to be boring, stereotyped and incomprehensible. A couple of bizarre sex scenes have been thrown in for good measure, naturally starring a twenty-something woman.The main character, one Daniel Baliant, is a self-hating Orthodox Jew who becomes a neo-Nazi. All the usual Nazi stereotypes are there: skinheads, the fight between Daniel and The Big Tattooed Guy at the secret Nazi camp, the fat stupid Nazi, the crazy paranoid Nazi, etc. There is even a computer nerd Nazi. Since Daniel is an educated intellectual type of person, it's unclear why he would hang out with underclass skinheads of this sort. Nor is it clear why the ""respectable"" fascist front group recruits a crazy skinhead and suspected terrorist as a fund-raising speaker. In other words: the plot is very illogical! And no, it's not *really* based on a true story. Finally, the anti-Semitic speeches of the main character are meaningless rants. I fail to see why other customer reviewers found them so disturbing. Neither intellectual nor underclass Nazis sound like this.Occasionally, ""The Believer"" does hint at a deeper message: Baliant seems to be a sceptic or atheist who argued with his Jewish teachers already in school, he seems to reject Judaism because the Jews went like lambs to the slaughter during the Holocaust, hence proving their weakness, and there are some kind of Kabbalistic hints which I didn't understand. There is also a tension between Danny and his equally Nazi girlfriend, who seems to be fascinated by Judaism and perhaps thinks of converting. However, the movie never really follows up on any of this. The end is also inconclusive. Does God forgive Danny and take him to Heaven? Does he end up in Hell? Is the message really atheist? No idea.Maybe people who studied the Zohar for twenty years can grasp the esoteric message of ""The Believer"". I didn't. I was just bored.PS.

Vegan,"[3, 4]","Like ""Romper Stomper"" and the intensely powerful ""American History X,"" here we have another brilliant film which revolves around National Socialism and the fiercely racist ideals behind it. This movie, however, varies strongly from the two previously mentioned in that it seems to have been researched far more heavily, and, focuses on not a general Neo-Nazi or skinhead, but on a young Jewish man--who has turned to Neo-Nazis and fascism for strength.This film revolves around a young man who was born and raised into Judaism only to become heavily fed up with the styles, rules, rituals, and apparent hypocrisies therein. Ever since his youth he'd been questioning the Jewish faith and the very meaning of being Jewish. The film follows him as he struggles with the faith he was raised with and the Nazi ideals he adopts against it. Through it all, he also struggles with his own identity and the hypnotic way that these two opposing ideologies have power over people. On top of that, he's later recruited by a group of neo-fascists, so to speak, looking to make fascism a reputable political movement, much like Communism has evolved into Democratic societies these days as Socialism.This film is certainly worth your time to rent.",3,Very strong film,1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,1234,"['Romper', 'Stomper', 'intensely', 'powerful', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'here', 'have', 'brilliant', 'film', 'National', 'Socialism', 'fiercely', 'racist', 'ideals', 'movie', 'however', 'varies', 'strongly', 'two', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'have', 'been', 'researched', 'far', 'more', 'heavily', 'focuses', 'not', 'general', 'Neo-Nazi', 'skinhead', 'young', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'turned', 'Neo-Nazis', 'fascism', 'strength.This', 'film', 'around', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Judaism', 'only', 'become', 'heavily', 'fed', 'up', 'styles', 'rules', 'rituals', 'apparent', 'hypocrisies', 'therein', 'Ever', 'youth', ""'d"", 'been', 'questioning', 'Jewish', 'faith', 'very', 'meaning', 'being', 'Jewish', 'film', 'faith', 'was', 'raised', 'Nazi', 'ideals', 'also', 'own', 'identity', 'hypnotic', 'way', 'two', 'opposing', 'ideologies', 'have', 'power', 'people', 'top', 'later', 'recruited', 'group', 'neo-fascists', 'so', 'speak', 'looking', 'make', 'fascism', 'reputable', 'political', 'movement', 'much', 'Communism', 'evolved', 'Democratic', 'societies', 'days', 'Socialism.This', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'time', 'rent']",N/A
737064,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B00008AOSA,azindn,"[3, 5]","Possibly flying over the heads with its subtle position, The Believer is a striking film that challenges today's audiences to examine their own definitions of religious faith, race, prejudice, and the contempt of modern society for all forms of institutional ideologies disguised as hate and intolerance. Ryan Gosling (The Notebook) gives a brilliant portrait of Danny, a skin head youth whose hatred for Jews manifests in bullying and intellectual jousting with moronic lesser grunts.At first, Danny seems the quintessence of neo-Nazism as he espouses rhetoric and baits his family with his nihilistic actions. It is revealed early in the film that Danny is in fact a Jew and has jousted with the intellectual points of spiritual faith and belief systems since a young boy. His questions angered his teachers resulting in Danny's antagonism towards both Judaism as a religion, and Jews as followers of the belief system which he was expected to embrace.Gosling in a staggering performance is a pawn of both religious and political manipulators who seize on his intellectual skills of debate to further their own agendas, but his true inner struggle is with himself. In attempting to deny the source of his identity as a Jew, Danny strikes out through his anti-Semetic acts that torment and confuse him all the more. His hatred is self-hatred, and for all his verbal acumen, he is unable or unwilling to turn from the religious practices and rituals that he hides under a swastika t-shirt and Nazi salutes while reciting in Yiddish from the Torah.Unlike other films such as American X, the Believer approaches the topic with much more intellectual examination of issues of racism and anti-Semetic American culture today. Based on the true story of a Jew who joined the KKK in the 60s and was outed by the NY Times, The Believer poses serious questions to challenge audiences about the insidious nature of racism, bigotry, and fascism that permeate American society today.

He hangs around typical brain-dead skinheads where he seems to be out of place. Even though he is Jewish, he preaches to everyone that he is not and aside of this, he hates the Jewish people. Through flash Danny's flashbacks, we learn that he was never really a top notch Jewish believer but more so an Orthodox Jew with ideas and questions of his own.Danny befriends Lina (Theresa Russell) and Curtis (Billy Zane), founders of an underground fascist movement who see potential in Danny. They see his as a well educated and a well spoken young man who knows so much about the enemy, of course they have no idea that the reason why Danny knows so much is because he is Jewish. However, they do not question it, they let it be and use Danny knowledge to help their underground foundation grow bigger. Not too long after, Danny starts to battle his own demons, he is torn between what he thinks he knows and what he believes in.

What makes this movie even more fascinating is that it is based on a true story.The opening sequence in which the film's protaganist Danny Balint (Ryan Gosling) beats up a Jewish student he stalks from the subway is chilling and leaves the viewer appalled at Balint's ignorance and self-loathing and his apparent unwillingness to accept his creed.In several flashback scenes  a nerdy Danny is shown in his Torah class giving opinions on religion his teacher doesn't like- actually very intelligent and provocative observations- his teacher's inability to accept a different opinion to his only serves to add another dent in Danny's psyche (As a lapsed Catholic, I can understand this all too well).THE BELIEVER is utterly compelling, Gosling gives a frighteningly plausible performance, the scene in which he gives a newspaper reporter a look at his passionate but undeniably flawed reasoning is one of many powerful moments. A couple of other sequences of the movie I found very interesting is a film clip where God is describedby a yeshiva as ""The purest form of spirit. Nothingness without end""; and especially the scene where Danny rolls up a damaged Torah scroll while his friends are destroying a Jewish synagogue. The movie also co-stars Theresa Russell and the almost unrecognizable Billy Zane both in fine perfomances as nazi radicals.

What the film is really about is a highly intelligent yet tourmented young man named Danny.Danny grew up in the othordox faith but was always questioning the tenants of his inhairited beleif system. Flashbacks in the film show him questioning his teachers and rabbis. Danny had an incicive and critital mind: he was humilatiated by those he questioned. This was the real crime--Danny was so smart, he would truely have been a great individual if those abilities were nurtured and not squashed.But they were squashed, and Danny is not such a great individual. For whatever reason, he has all the hate of the far less bright neo-nazis he hangs with. He engages in the brutalaty too, such as beating up an Hasidic boy and trashing a synogage.The film is great in that it makes you work to understand Danny's thinking process and the conclusions he has come to about Judism. These are not told in cleches, but in detailed, complex logic highly individual to Danny/ You have to get on his level of intellagance to understand why he is so collosully screwed up, and it is rare to and refreshing to find a film that makes these kind of intellectual demands on you.Yet you cannot help feel sorry for Danny. What kind of rage and self hate drives a smart young man to this point. What works about the Beleiver is that deep down, we know Danny understands he is wrong.

Well, because that teen is Jewish...and, according to the movie, Jews have superior speaking skills, superior critical thinking abilities, superior intelligence, superior fighting abilities, superior debating abilities, and endless other Jewish supremist myths.You see, according to this movie, all neo-Nazis are dumb knuckle-dragging brutes (aka, whites). And when the Jew isn't dominating the brutes (whites) with his superior brain, he's knocking them out with his fists...literally.But why does this Jewish teen hate Jews? Well, according to the movie, he mostly hates Jews because Jews have superior sexuality, superior intelligence, superior culture, superior business mind, superior spirituality, etc. Really...those are most of his arguments.What about the other arguments? Well, he contradicts them with Jewish supremacist myths. For example, he picks on a Jewish kid for being weak and cowardly, but later he (a Jew) beats up a 'Goliath' of a man. Another example, he ridiculously claims Jews lack thrusting abilities, then later he's bitter about how great Jews are in bed.You see, the subtext of the movie is that Jews are better...just better.Thus, in the end, he succombs to the notion of Jewish supremacy and their inevitable domination of the world...and advises non-Jews to just accept it too and to just love Jews...yep, just love them. But don't love them as you would any ol' human, love them for their superiority...otherwise, their superiority will, according to the movie, make you into a bitter, jealous person.BTW: This movie was never meant to go wide because the audience was mostly in cities that show limited releases: Jews. This movie is, like most anti-nazi movies, meant more to motivate Jews to support Jewish leaders than enlighten/shame non-Jews. A Jew who both feels his/her belief system/race is superior than others and who is a bit scared of anti-semitism is much more likley to support Jewish leader's 'support Israel by any means necessary'.Face it, like every other kind of supremacist, Jewish supremacy exists. It exists in Hollywood, in US politics, and it definately exists in Israel.Instead of looking for ways to reward Gosling for this movie (as they have done for Crowe and Norton for perpetuating neo-nazi stereotype)...perhaps Hollywood should point its cameras honestly at Israel.

Well, I'm here to say that those people were quite correct in that assessment.And interestingly (to me anyway), I also found many parallels and echoes of ""Half Nelson"" in this film, which is notable because ""The Believer"" was made five years previous.  In ""Half Nelson"", teacher Dan Dunne (Gosling) tells his young students about the concept of dialectics: ""It's two things that push against each other in opposite directions.""And in ""The Believer,"" we see that concept amazingly personified by Gosling in the character of Daniel Balint.  After all, what could be more disjointedly dichotomous than a young Jewish skinhead who wears a t-shirt with a giant swastika on the front?  Also, Balint has a thoughtful but tremendously conflicted mind that seems to find peace in mindless violence.  A study of opposites, indeed...I must admit that going in to this movie I was worried that such an extreme polarity in the lead role would make the character (or even the movie itself) a bit sensationalistic at best and cartoonish at worst.  Thankfully, the script by writer/director Henry Bean and Gosling's thoughtful acting choices prevent them from being either.In fact, as I later learned in the DVD commentary, this character is actually based on a true person and a real historical event.  And the film is largely shot with such documentary-styled realism (the director and cinematographer cited gritty French film La Promesse as a big influence), that in some ways it might have been a little too real for its own good: apparently, a prominent rabbi at one screening objected so vehemently to this film's scenes of desecration that some say it's the reason such a critically-lauded movie never got picked up for theatrical distribution.That said, even if this movie had played in many theaters, I doubt it would have appealed to a very large audience - there are many visually, viscerally intense moments that will have you squirming uncomfortably in your seat.  And the film is itself not without a few flaws.Still, according to the director in a 16-minute interview extra on this DVD (included along with a terrific episode of the Sundance Channel's ""Making of a Scene""), on the set making the film everybody was saying, ""This is a star.  We're seeing a star.  And we're seeing him in that perfect moment before anybody else knows he's a star.""I heartily agree.  And I highly recommend you see ""The Believer"" for that reason above all others - to both see Gosling before his star shone as brightly, and to see why it burns so brilliantly today.",4,Dialectics Personified,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,2902,"['many', 'reading', 'review', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'first', 'heard/read', 'Believer', 'seeing', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'outstanding', 'Oscar-nominated', 'should', 'have', 'been', '-winning', 'performance', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'reading', 'more', 'film', 'people', 'often', 'referred', 'one', 'containing', 'performance', 'Gosling', 'bit', 'stellar', 'Well', ""'m"", 'here', 'say', 'people', 'were', 'quite', 'correct', 'assessment.And', 'interestingly', 'anyway', 'also', 'found', 'many', 'parallels', 'echoes', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'film', 'notable', 'Believer', 'was', 'made', 'five', 'years', 'previous', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'teacher', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'Gosling', 'young', 'students', 'concept', 'dialectics', 'two', 'things', 'push', 'other', 'opposite', 'directions', 'Believer', 'see', 'concept', 'amazingly', 'personified', 'Gosling', 'character', 'Daniel', 'Balint', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'disjointedly', 'dichotomous', 'young', 'Jewish', 'skinhead', 'who', 't-shirt', 'giant', 'swastika', 'front', 'Also', 'Balint', 'thoughtful', 'tremendously', 'conflicted', 'mind', 'find', 'peace', 'mindless', 'violence', 'study', 'opposites', 'indeed', 'must', 'admit', 'going', 'movie', 'was', 'worried', 'extreme', 'polarity', 'lead', 'role', 'would', 'make', 'character', 'even', 'movie', 'bit', 'sensationalistic', 'best', 'cartoonish', 'worst', 'Thankfully', 'script', 'writer/director', 'Henry', 'Bean', 'Gosling', 'thoughtful', 'acting', 'choices', 'prevent', 'being', 'either.In', 'fact', 'later', 'learned', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'character', 'actually', 'based', 'true', 'person', 'real', 'historical', 'event', 'film', 'largely', 'shot', 'such', 'documentary-styled', 'realism', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'cited', 'gritty', 'French', 'film', 'La', 'Promesse', 'big', 'influence', 'ways', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'real', 'own', 'good', 'apparently', 'prominent', 'rabbi', 'one', 'screening', 'objected', 'so', 'vehemently', 'film', 'scenes', 'desecration', 'say', 'reason', 'such', 'critically-lauded', 'movie', 'never', 'got', 'picked', 'up', 'theatrical', 'distribution.That', 'said', 'even', 'movie', 'had', 'played', 'many', 'theaters', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'appealed', 'very', 'large', 'audience', 'are', 'many', 'visually', 'viscerally', 'intense', 'moments', 'will', 'have', 'squirming', 'uncomfortably', 'seat', 'film', 'not', 'few', 'flaws.Still', 'according', 'director', '16-minute', 'interview', 'extra', 'DVD', 'included', 'terrific', 'episode', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'Making', 'Scene', 'set', 'making', 'film', 'everybody', 'was', 'saying', 'star', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'star', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'perfect', 'moment', 'anybody', 'else', 'star', 'heartily', 'agree', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'Believer', 'reason', 'others', 'see', 'Gosling', 'star', 'shone', 'brightly', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'today']",N/A

Based on actual events, this may not be an exact accounting but it has many rings of truth throughout it's powerful message.  What makes this film so moving is the transformation that takes place within the lead character Danny, that transformation that's laced with confusion, as if he were a lost soul trying to find where he fits in, where he belongs.Through flash backs we are able to see the reasons behind Danny's hatred for the Jewish race, but as he associates with fellow Nazi's Lina (Theresa Russell) and Curtis (Billy Zane) he's drawn back into the ways of his people by their beautiful daughter Carla (Summer Phoenix).  As Danny struggles to decide where his life is truly headed he's forced to drastically prove to himself he is really a Nazi and that he hates these Jews, that he is no part of them and has no desire to be so.  Henry Bean has written and directed such a powerful character drama that reaches down and forces us to look at ourselves.  This is not a film that promotes racism, not in the slightest.  This is a film about finding yourself and having the courage to be who you are no matter what anyone says about it.  Danny couldn't find himself, at least not until it was too late.

It is more about a man's internal conflicts than about neo-Nazism.

Like why have the Jews been persecuted since their beginning? And why should mankind have faith in religion? And what is Truth? These points make the film far more engaging than you might expect if all you saw was the trailer.

737075,A2L7JN8R6GQE0F,B00008AOSA,Gunther Haagendazs,"[4, 13]","I'm going to disagree with most of the people who praise this film.  Its story is good and really made me want to watch the film, however I was ultimately disappointed.  American History X is a far superior take on Neo-Nazism in America than The Believer.In American History X, Edward Norton says some pretty racist stuff, but he says them in a way where you go ""He's wrong, but he has a point..."" and it made you feel dirty because of that, but you couldn't look away.  It kinda convinced you and made you nod your head in agreement while shaking your head back and forth at the same time.  It sucked you in and you couldn't look away, with some exceptions of the infamous curb stomping scene for some people.  Edward Norton's character also went through a transformation and changes his ways.In The Believer, Ryan Gosling is for the most part an utterly annoying idiot.  He says the same racist stuff, but in a way that is in the main stereotype of a racist.  He never backs up what he says and it isn't very convincing.  When confronted about what he's said and proven wrong, he simply dodges the remark and storms out of the room.  And for a self-hating Jew who happens to be a Neo-Nazi, there are frequent moments where he does a HORRIBLE job at hiding the fact that he's a Jew to his fellow Neo-Nazi friends.  The viewer wants to know why he thinks and acts like he does, especially with this Neo-Nazi being a Jew himself, however we are never given any good reason other then he had an argument with a teacher when he was a kid.  What a pansy.  He needed a good Curb-stomping.The pace of the Believer is also rather slow (an odd thing considering it's only 99 minutes), I'd frequently check my watch to see how much was left.  And of course there was the awful artistic ending that suggests Gosling's character was stuck in that moment in time when he went to school. The flashbacks to the classroom are quite possibly the best parts of the movie and the most convincing.  I could go on but the simple fact is that this film could have been made so much better.

737077,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00008AOSA,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 6]","To be or not to be a Jew. The film seems to tell us how a Jew tried to become a nazi in today's America. In fact it opens up a completely different ideological and historical cornucopia. What happened to the Jewsih people when they decided to codify their faith, their life and their vision of the world in a set of books that were declared to be God's own discourse ? It became absolutely unchangeable, untransformable, and the Jews all know that history is an ever moving and ever changing reality that can neither be denied because it is the real world, nor accepted because it implies the sacred books are not eternally true. This creates a tremendous need for the Jews to privatize their faith in God, their religion and their rites as a purely personal business, and to invest their public life in the world in order to do things, to be involved, to be carried six days a week by the changing wave of historical movement. Their life, their consciousness, their vision of the world are thus split in two and this division of life in two makes it impossible for them either to push their belief to the absolute end of it which means the rejection of the real world, nor to invest themselves into the real world totally which would mean the rejection of the forever unchanging corpus of their religious beliefs. And it is this very dilemma that is the very energy necessary for them to excel in any field they will try to penetrate : they will excel in order to sublimate and compensate the deeply torn consciousness of theirs, and at the same time they will invent intellectual systems that will systematically divide reality in two opposed elements that can never merge nor disappear, history and the real world being always a remapping of the same two antagons. Marx will postulate the class struggle reduced to two antagonistic classes, the working class and the bourgeoisie. Freud will postulate the psyche of the individual as being the antagonistic struggle between two principles, Eros and Thanatos. Even Einstein will postulate reality to be the combination of two antagonistic principles that are associated in an eternal confrontation under the uncatchable concept of energy. Everything is energy but energy is a dual carriage way that leads nowhere and is nothing but two ever moving lanes of traffic that are both evading and chasing each other. The question that remains in our minds when the screen turns black is : if we can't evade this reality, if this vision is true, what can human beings, Jewish or not, do ? Escape it in total self-destruction (that can be hijacked into destroying other people for a while like Hitler or Himmler did), or submit to this reality, call this submission faith and God, and follow the trend and the current the way it goes. This vision is utterly pessimistic since there is no possible conscious effective action for human beings to influence the future that will be the blind result of the inner dialectics of material reality. It can even lead some to believe there cannot be any freedom, any peace, any progress, and that this material world is nothing but a materialistic illusion, that our supposed consciousness is nothing but a dream and circular self-hypnosis.

First, one reviewer compared Gosling's performance to De Niro in Taxi Driver which is a travesty. While turning in a good performance, Gosling is in no way as chilling or believable as De Niro was as Travis Bickle. Taxi Driver is a landmark of American cinema...this is not. Now to the film. The Believer is based on a true story about a Jew who becomes so disenfranchised with his religion he decides to become it's antithesis: a nazi. This is a more than interesting premise that is pulled off fairly well mainly due to the strong performance of Ryan Gosling. Gosling's character is near genius and tortured. He, deep down, loves and respects the tenets of Judiaism but because of scarring experiences during his formative teenage years he choses to disprove the ""lies"" and illuminate the contradictions of his religion rather than embrace it. There is some violence in The Believer but it is rather tame by industry standards. The real pain in this film is felt emotionally by it's protagonist. Gosling has chosen a career making role here and I couldn't help but gain respect for this gutsy career choice. The temple scene is a little overly dramatic, but hey this is big budget hollywood we're talking about. I will say this, the ending of this film has stuck with me and made me think about life in general for weeks now, so this film has definitely made an impact on me. Will it for you?

At a meeting among other like minded individuals discussing how to bring about the rise of the Nazi party in America, he brings up killing the Jews.  The other people at the meeting express shock and disagree about the necessity of this, but Danny speaks so passionately and articulately that while they don't agree, they are moved by what he says.  Danny hates the Jews.  He hates them.  The film opens with a powerful sequencesthat is intercut with the opening credits on a black screen.  We see a teenaged Jewish student getting onto a train.  The music starts to pick up in intensity and Danny is getting closer to the student, pressing closer and intimidating.  When the student leaves the train he is confronted and attacked by Danny.  Now we see what kind of person Danny is.  On the lapel of his jacket there is a Nazi Stormtrooper button.Danny joins up with another group of young neo-nazis with the intent of harassing, damaging property, and even killing a Jew.  This is the ultimate goal.  To kill.  To persecute.  If this was all the film was about, we might still have a decent movie.  But ""The Believer"" is much more than this because of who Danny is, and more specifically, what Danny is.  Danny is Jewish.  Now we are presented with the issue of Danny's hatred towards his own people (and by association, himself).  Why does he hate them so much?

737080,A3LGFYDVKLICY8,B00008AOSA,John Morgan,"[2, 3]","""The Believer"" is not a film about neo-Nazism, although it does make some valid points about the ultimately religious nature of the rituals and philosophy of National Socialism (what some have termed ""esoteric Hitlerism""), as well as the inconsistencies of anti-Semitic ideology (i.e., anti-Semites claim to hate Jews both because they're weak, yet at the same time because their influence on the world is so strong). It is a bit more about Judaism, evoking some of the mysteries which lie at the heart of its theology, but the film's ultimate point goes far beyond the nature of any specific religion. As the title suggests, this film is about the nature of belief, and the particular problems that those of us who live in the modern world face if we choose to become believers in any form of spirituality. The contradiction that this entails is that, in the modern world, people are often tempted by the power of spirituality, but because most of us are weaned on the idea that the sovereign individual should be at the center of everything, we find it difficult to make the act of complete surrender of our freedom to something exterior to ourselves - God - that, like Danny, the main character of this film, we seek God, but are unable to open ourselves to the relationship which would enable us to see Him. In ""The Believer,"" Danny is at first entranced by his inherited Judaism, but then, frustrated by what he sees as the unjust nature of the Hebrew God, tries to become a hardcore neo-Nazi. However, Danny's inability to acknowledge that there is anything superior to him - God, or anything else - remains, and he is never able to fully commit himself to either belief. Over the course of the film, Danny begins to mix the two beliefs, weaving and trapping himself within the web of an increasingly bizarre and dangerous ideology which fails to resolve the dissatisfaction that he experiences. In our age of designer religions, in which people often select parts from many different belief systems in order to fashion something which is ""right for them,"" this act of syncretism allows them to leave out the most important aspect, surrender, which is essential to reaping the benefits of any genuine system of beliefs. The modern West has, for the most part, forgotten this fact, which is why Americans gawk in horror at the sight of Muslim women who wear headscarves, unable to understand their motivation, and why many Christians forego the genuine teachings of the Bible in favor of believing that Jesus wants them to be rich and that low taxes are a divine right. Yet, as for Danny, the hunger for belief does not go away - it is merely sublimated, often in extremely self-destructive forms.If you are a secular-minded person, then this film will seem like a nightmare to you - the story of a young man who is incapable of reconciling his idealism with the real world, and as such is condemned to a life of perpetual frustration, anger and fear. If you are a religiously-minded person, then you will see it as a warning against the dangers of belief without humility. Either way, you will not be able to watch it and remain unmoved.",5,A profound cinematic statement about the nature of spirituality,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,3143,"['Believer', 'not', 'film', 'neo-Nazism', 'make', 'valid', 'points', 'ultimately', 'religious', 'nature', 'rituals', 'philosophy', 'National', 'Socialism', 'what', 'have', 'termed', 'esoteric', 'Hitlerism', 'as', 'well', 'inconsistencies', 'anti-Semitic', 'ideology', 'i.e.', 'anti-Semites', 'claim', 'hate', 'Jews', ""'re"", 'weak', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'influence', 'world', 'so', 'strong', 'bit', 'more', 'Judaism', 'evoking', 'mysteries', 'lie', 'heart', 'theology', 'film', 'ultimate', 'point', 'far', 'nature', 'specific', 'religion', 'title', 'film', 'nature', 'belief', 'particular', 'problems', 'who', 'live', 'modern', 'world', 'face', 'choose', 'become', 'believers', 'form', 'spirituality', 'contradiction', 'modern', 'world', 'people', 'are', 'often', 'tempted', 'power', 'spirituality', 'most', 'are', 'weaned', 'idea', 'sovereign', 'individual', 'should', 'be', 'center', 'everything', 'find', 'difficult', 'make', 'act', 'complete', 'surrender', 'freedom', 'something', 'exterior', 'ourselves', 'God', 'Danny', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'seek', 'God', 'are', 'unable', 'open', 'relationship', 'would', 'enable', 'see', 'Him', 'Believer', 'Danny', 'first', 'entranced', 'inherited', 'Judaism', 'then', 'frustrated', 'what', 'unjust', 'nature', 'Hebrew', 'God', 'become', 'hardcore', 'neo-Nazi', 'However', 'Danny', 'inability', 'acknowledge', 'anything', 'superior', 'God', 'anything', 'else', 'remains', 'never', 'able', 'fully', 'commit', 'belief', 'course', 'film', 'Danny', 'mix', 'two', 'beliefs', 'weaving', 'trapping', 'web', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'dangerous', 'ideology', 'resolve', 'dissatisfaction', 'age', 'designer', 'religions', 'people', 'often', 'select', 'parts', 'many', 'different', 'belief', 'systems', 'order', 'fashion', 'something', 'right', 'act', 'syncretism', 'leave', 'out', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'surrender', 'essential', 'reaping', 'benefits', 'genuine', 'system', 'beliefs', 'modern', 'West', 'most', 'part', 'forgotten', 'fact', 'why', 'Americans', 'gawk', 'horror', 'sight', 'Muslim', 'women', 'who', 'wear', 'headscarves', 'unable', 'understand', 'motivation', 'why', 'many', 'Christians', 'forego', 'genuine', 'teachings', 'Bible', 'favor', 'believing', 'Jesus', 'be', 'rich', 'low', 'taxes', 'are', 'divine', 'right', 'Yet', 'Danny', 'hunger', 'belief', 'not', 'go', 'away', 'merely', 'sublimated', 'often', 'extremely', 'self-destructive', 'forms.If', 'are', 'secular-minded', 'person', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'seem', 'nightmare', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'incapable', 'reconciling', 'idealism', 'real', 'world', 'such', 'condemned', 'life', 'perpetual', 'frustration', 'anger', 'fear', 'are', 'religiously-minded', 'person', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'warning', 'dangers', 'belief', 'humility', 'way', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'remain', 'unmoved']",N/A
737081,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00008AOSA,Joseph Haschka,"[5, 6]","Towards the end of THE BELIEVER, I mused on the similarity of the film to the 1975 screen production of THE MAN IN THE GLASS BOOTH starring Maximilian Schell. In the latter, Schell stars as a reclusive, wealthy, Jewish, Manhattan industrialist, Arthur Goldman, who (apparently) has used his connections and financial resources to create the fiction that he's a former Nazi prison commandant, a fabrication (apparently) leaked to the Israelis. Without knowing this beforehand, It comes as a surprise to the viewers and Goldman's associates, but not to Arthur himself, when he's kidnapped (as was Adolf Eichmann) and removed to Israel to stand trial as a war criminal - on display in a glass booth wearing full Nazi regalia. Schell is stunningly powerful as the concentration camp survivor who goes to extremes to exorcise his personal guilt at having outlived the Holocaust, and what he sees as the collective guilt of his people for not fighting back.In THE BELIEVER, Ryan Gosling is Danny, an incredibly intelligent, literate and articulate 22-year old who spends his days as a neo-Nazi skinhead preaching hatred and expressing the desire to kill Jews. His activities run the full gamut from planting bombs with a group of like-minded, mindless thugs, to fund raising in a suit and tie for an upscale Fascist organization. The thing is, you see, Danny is himself a Jew with deep emotional ties to his heritage.It's perhaps an over-simplification to say that Danny hates Jews. Rather, he hates the message that Orthodox Jews preach, i.e. that Jews are but the pawns of God and must be submissive to His will - even to the point of abject pacifism in the face of the most extreme persecution. Danny is not, nor has ever been, submissive to his religion and its appointed teachers. He doesn't loathe his Jewish self so much as the thought that his religion automatically makes him a submissive creature. Basically, he wants the Chosen People to fight back. This is evident early on as he savagely beats a meek, yarmulke-wearing teenage boy while screaming, &quot;Hit me! Hit me!&quot; Moreover, he figuratively shakes his fist at God, daring Him to strike him dead for his rebellion.At one point, Danny asserts that the Jews are naturally a wandering people thriving on the prejudice they encounter, and that the Israeli's have risen above their Jewishness because they now have a land to call home. Since the Israeli's are aggressively militant in their own defense, it seems to me that Danny might just as well be a staunch Zionist. Why he isn't is a mystery. But, no matter, because Gosling, like Schell, is stunning as a guilt-ridden and psychologically tortured individual seeking inner peace. While the film's conclusion is the ambiguous sort that invites extended coffee house discussion, it's evident that Danny goes to an extreme to find it.

737084,A2VMVTDYQDA6L8,B00008AOSA,Laura Knight-Jadczyk,"[17, 22]","I bought this movie because I had read several online discussions about it  which mainly focused on the excellent portrayal of the conflicted central character, Daniel Balint.  I had also read claims that the film was anti-Semitic so I wanted to see exactly how bad it was.  I decided to watch it with no preconceptions.For me, it was shocking to see a portrayal of neo-Nazis, never mind that one of them was supposed to be Jewish.  It was fascinating and revolting at the same time to see apparently normal looking people who espouse ideas and philosophies that are completely repugnant to a normal human being who has empathy and compassion for his fellow man.  The problem is, as we know, such people do exist - and a lot more of them than we would like to admit.So, what was so fascinating to me was to see and hear the justification of the young Jewish man played by Ryan Gosling, for why he - of all people - would be attracted to such horrible ideology.The answer wasn't long in coming.  Via a series of flashbacks to his childhood when he was in yeshiva and arguing about god with his teacher, we are presented with a view of Judaism that is stark and, at the same time, due to the fact that it comes from a young boy, fresh and innovative. The subject is the ""almost sacrifice"" of Isaac by his own father, Abraham.The example of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son, Isaac, has been trotted out for ages as the supreme example of how one is to approach the ""god"". One must be willing to give the god anything and everything! This ""Faith"" is an essential part of the ""covenant"" with the god - a sort of ""act of trade"", so to say.In my opinion, the image of Abraham, who was willing to sacrifice his own son, is not so compelling a picture. It merely symbolizes a sort of mindless belief in the orders of someone or something ""out there"" that certainly may not have the best interests of humanity at heart.We can perceive, in the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son, the  terror of Cain who killed his brother because his sacrifice was not accepted. A god who picks and chooses what sacrifice is ""good enough"" - setting brother against brother - is certainly a ""jealous god"", and such a god is a psychopath.Danny Balint, as a child, saw this.  Here is the exchange from the movie:Young Danny: I'm the only one who does believe. I see him for the power-drunk madman he is. And we're supposed to worship such a deity? I say never.Rav Zingesser: And you, had you come out of Egypt you would have been destroyed in the desert with all of those who worshipped the Golden Calf!Young Danny: Then let him destroy me now. Let him crush me like the conceited bully he is.Pretty astute observation for a kid.And that seems to be the theme that runs through the movie: an expose of Judaism as it is - a striving for nothingness and worship of ritual rather than a real god.Counterposed against this is Danny's apparent attachment to the Torah - the material representation of Judaism, that is -  which he takes risks to protect and describes the ""history"" of it to his girlfriend.  His historical knowledge of the Torah is, of course, that which is taught to Jews and not based on Biblical scholarship.The thing that comes across most clearly is why Danny hates Jews (including himself) and that is the very meat of the matter: anti-Semitism, the holocaust, and so on.To Danny, Jews are to be hated because they thrive on this aversion; they actually use it to define themselves as ""persecuted"" and afflicted and victims. In Danny's mind, as portrayed in the movie, it is Jewish powerlessness and their apparent inability to fight back during all those persecutions that he despises more than anything else.  And he perceives this powerlessness to be a consequence of the brainwashing of their religion.Funny little voice overlays occur here and there in the movie that are like dialogs with a rabbi: ""question: is it permissible to answer the phone on the sabbath? answer: no.  question: what if it could be an emergency?  answer: it is okay to knock the phone of the hook with your elbow and listen to who is calling and determine if it is an emergency...""It is nonsense like that, slavish following of rules that bespeak a god who is, as Danny points out, a power-drunk madman.All of this is made clear in an exchange with an old couple of Holocaust survivors.  The old man tells how a German soldier killed his infant son, bayoneting the child right out of his arms and holding him overhead while the child died in agony and the blood poured on the father.  Danny is outraged by this story, that the father did not sacrifice his own life to save his son, but stood by helplessly.The real conflict in the movie is that this young man can clearly see the absurdity of his religion (and in my opinion, this is true of all religions, I'm not picking on Judaism), but he has been so inculcated into religious piety from infancy, that he cannot resolve this conflict.  He can be neither a Jew, nor free of being a Jew. More than that, he also despises the ignorance of other anti-Semites because they are ignorant and do not hate Jews for the ""right reasons"" nor do they admire and emulate the Nazis for the right reasons.Ryan Gosling gives one heck of a performance, alternating between his dissociated personalities.Billy Zane and Theresa Russell are the bizarre couple who are leaders of some kind of covert fascist organization.  They don't come across as very interesting or even really committed to what they are espousing.  It seems more like a social club than anything else.  When Danny and his skinhead friends join up with them, things get a lot more intense.Danny inspires them with his brilliant rhetoric, which is how the viewer comes to know so much about his reflections on Judaism.  He does, indeed, articulate what seem to be compelling and ""valid"" reasons for anti-Semitism, but they are all based on the same attitude that he despises about Judaism's god: that he is a psychopathic bully.  And so, Danny has become one also.I did a bit of research and discovered that the real character on whom the movie was based, one Daniel Burros, committed suicide after he was exposed as a Jew.The final scene in the movie reiterates the concept of the god of Judaism as perceived by Danny - constantly going up a flight of stairs, trying to get to the top, but constantly finding yourself where you started - never getting anywhere.  Nothingness.This is not just a rhetorical device for a movie, either! Giovanni Garbini writes inMyth And History in the Bible (Academic Paperback):""The examination of some aspects, usually neglected, though evident and essential, of the mythic reconstruction of Israel's past and of the figure of its God as the Hebrew religious thought presented them in the Bible presents us an apparently paradoxical situation.""The Law and the Prophets ... codify and exalt a kind of religion centred on the cult of Yahweh, national and sole true god, who established the Jerusalem temple as his only seat; from the other, they reveal explicitly the moral inconsistency of that god... his unfulfilled promises and the vacuity of all the practices related to his cult.""The first chapter of Isaiah, which opens the section of Latter Prophets and, as all the writings placed at the beginning of a collection, gives the key to its interpretation, cannot be more explicit in this regard.""The chiefs of Jerusalem, that is the high priests, are called 'rulers of Sodom' and its population 'people of Gomorrah (Isa. 1:10). Against them, in the following verses, God refuses all the cultic practices: sacrifices, burnt offerings, visits to the temple, oblations, incense, new moon, Sabbath, readings, fastings, assemblies, feasts, prayers.""It is not pointless to ask ourselves what was the effect on the priests of the obsessive motif, present in all the Bible, of gratitude to Yahweh for the deliverance of Israel from Egypt: such a deliverance never took place and was invented by themselves to allude, probably, to their return from Babylon.""...[T]he interesting thing is that, apart from the many details concerning the external activities of the priesthood (which any Jew in Jerusalem could easily see with his own eyes), the texts do not contain any information about the structures, the organization and the other activities of the priestly class; it is like seeing only the front of a building.""In these biblical writings we find not only a description of the religious practices, but often also their history, their meaning and their mythic origin, and since the religion of Israel is the expression of its relationship with Yahweh, all Israel's history becomes the history of this religion. In other words, these books fix a precise moment in the history of Hebrew religion, when a deep reflection on its nature was carried out. On the basis of this reflection, the entire past was reinterpreted (not as it was, but rather as they wanted it to be) and the future imagined, a glorious future with Jerusalem at the centre of the world.""Garbini then writes in a companion volume,History and Ideology in Ancient Israel, an amplification of the above problem:""Biblical Yahwism certainly reflects a monotheistic conception, but at the same time it is something less and something more than monotheism."" ...Yahwism seems to be something less than monotheism: God is certainly one, but he is essentially the God of just one people and he acts only with them. If we reflect on this aspect, which is the central nucleus of the Old Testament, we discover that here we have what the historians of religions call henotheism rather than monotheism.""On the other hand, Yahwism is also, and perhaps above all, an extremely rational vision of the world and of the privileged position that the people of Israel occupies in the world.""So it would be legitimate to ask whether one could consider as a real religion, with all that this word implies.. a doctrine like that taught in the Old Testament in the first millennium BC, which denies the survival of the spirit.""He then asks how it is that a 'religion' which attributes importance to liturgies practiced only in Jerusalem, (that is, not by all Jews at that period of history), which denies survival of the human spirit, could even have survived and spread, especially after the destruction of said temple.Good question.  And this is the question at the root of Daniel Balint's agony - a question he cannot resolve because of his programming from infancy.Highly recommended for, if no other reason, the truly stunning performance of Ryan Gosling as well as an insight into a bizarre world of neo-Nazis and anti-Semites - conflicted individuals all, wounded by our psychopathic society under the influence of psychopathic gods and religions that seek to induce mindless faith at the cost of human value.",5,The Horrible Truth,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,10875,"['bought', 'movie', 'had', 'read', 'several',

737085,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00008AOSA,Linda Linguvic,"[137, 144]","I was prepared to absolutely hate this 2001 film.  It's about Daniel, a Jewish young man who's an anti-Semite.  He supposedly hates Jews so much that he becomes a leader of a right wing group. He's cruel and angry and incredibly articulate about it.  In fact his arguments are so sophisticated and well done, that some Jewish groups have called it a ""primer for anti-Semitism"".  When the film was released, the press was so bad that the film never was distributed widely, especially since it came out around the time of 9/11.Based on an actual true story, the film is hard to watch.  The star, Ryan Gosling, is such a good actor that I believed in his characterization entirely.  His performance is nothing less than mesmerizing, as we see him go through conflicts and gradually change.  We see flashbacks to his early years when he attended a Yeshiva and argued with the teacher.  We also see short sequences enacting a holocaust story of a murdered child that he plays and replays in his mind.  We see a romance with a young woman who is fascinated with Judaism.  We see him and a gang of young toughs desecrating a synagogue. There are a lot of ugly words. And forbidden concepts.  I found myself cringing throughout.My heart was beating the whole time.  My eyes were glued to the screen.  I was disgusted and fascinated and horrified.  But, as the film progressed though, I saw that it was not an anti-Semitic film at all.  In fact, it said some wonderfully positive things about Judaism and made me proud to be a Jew.  However, I'm aware that many people will only see the hate and I understand why this film creates fear.  It's very powerful.  And it will probably feed the flames of hatred for those who already think that way.The DVD has some wonderful features. The director, Henry Bean, spoke at length about his search for an actor, his troubles with distributing the film, the true story on which the film is based, and his own struggles as an American assimilated Jew.  Another feature on the DVD showed the actual filming of one of the most pivotal scenes in the film. Daniel is alone in a room with a partially destroyed Torah, the holy scroll that all Jews hold sacred.  He carefully tries to clean it and repair it with tape.  And his body language and facial expressions show all his conflicts and contradictions.  The feature also discusses the camera angles, lenses and the use of the light and also talks about the changes made in the editing room.  All of this just added to my appreciation of the film.This is not a film for everyone.  And, unfortunately, it will be misinterpreted my many.  But I personally loved it.  And highly recommend it for those with an open mind.",5,"Powerful, disturbing and thought provoking.

737088,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00008AOSA,Martin Asiner,"[4, 6]","THE BELIEVER is one of the most controversial films in recent memory.  Director Henry Bean presents a film that won the prestigious Moscow Film Festival award in 2001.  Ryan Gosling is Daniel Balint, a young Jewish man who, early in his Talmudic studies, simply could not grasp the concept of Jew as a passive servant of God.  For him, the essence of Judiasm had to be power which could only be expressed when Jews dared to set themselves against God.  He rebelled, left the shul, and gravitated toward Neo-Nazism.  He shows himself to be more brutal toward Jews than do his fellow skinheads.  Soon enough, however, Daniel begins to distinguish between Jews and Jewish artifacts and beliefs.  He has no problem stomping on a yarmelked Jewish man who refuses to fight back.  The more this victim passively accepts that stomping, the more Daniel becomes enraged.  Later, when he and his skinheads desecrate a synagogue, he refuses to permit the destruction of its holy Torah scroll.  He even takes it back to his home to repair it.  Slowly, he begins to re-evaluate his motives as if he realizes that individual Jewish lives mean nothing, but immortal Jewish traditions mean everything.THE BELIEVER is a shocking film that is less about hatred of Jews and more about what it means to be a Jew.  Early on, Daniel makes this point clear when he insists that anti-semites hate Jews for the wrong reasons.  Money, media control, and cabals have nothing to do with that.  The real reason that fuels hatred of Jews, he maintains, is that Jews simply are.  Parents love their children as naturally as non-Jews hate Jews as an unspoken law of nature.Those who first saw THE BELIEVER during its intial release worried that it might fuel the rise of anti-semitism.  In fact, THE BELIEVER presents Jews in a positive light, as a group that can endure unremitting agony to such a degree that Daniel misinterprets that as synonymous with a welcoming of that agony.  At the end, the audience, through Daniel, has come full circle.  To believe in the necessity to endure the blind hatred of a two milennia old hatred is a Faulknerian virtue, not a Hitlerian vice.",5,THE BELIEVER: But What to Believe?,1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,2146,"['BELIEVER', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'Director', 'Henry', 'Bean', 'film', 'won', 'prestigious', 'Moscow', 'Film', 'Festival', 'award', '2001', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Daniel', 'Balint', 'young', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'early', 'Talmudic', 'studies', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'grasp', 'concept', 'Jew', 'passive', 'servant', 'God', 'essence', 'Judiasm', 'had', 'be', 'power', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'expressed', 'when', 'Jews', 'dared', 'set', 'God', 'rebelled', 'left', 'shul', 'gravitated', 'Neo-Nazism', 'be', 'more', 'brutal', 'Jews', 'do', 'fellow', 'skinheads', 'Soon', 'enough', 'however', 'Daniel', 'distinguish', 'Jews', 'Jewish', 'artifacts', 'beliefs', 'problem', 'stomping', 'yarmelked', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'fight', 'back', 'more', 'victim', 'passively', 'stomping', 'more', 'Daniel', 'enraged', 'Later', 'when', 'skinheads', 'desecrate', 'synagogue', 'permit', 'destruction', 'holy', 'Torah', 'scroll', 'even', 'back', 'home', 'repair', 'Slowly', 're-evaluate', 'motives', 'individual', 'Jewish', 'mean', 'nothing', 'immortal', 'Jewish', 'traditions', 'mean', 'BELIEVER', 'shocking', 'film', 'less', 'hatred', 'Jews', 'more', 'what', 'be', 'Jew', 'Early', 'Daniel', 'point', 'clear', 'when', 'anti-semites', 'hate', 'Jews', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'Money', 'media', 'control', 'cabals', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'real', 'reason', 'fuels', 'hatred', 'Jews', 'Jews', 'simply', 'are', 'Parents', 'love', 'children', 'as', 'naturally', 'non-Jews', 'hate', 'Jews', 'unspoken', 'law', 'nature.Those', 'who', 'first', 'saw', 'THE', 'BELIEVER', 'intial', 'release', 'worried', 'might', 'fuel', 'rise', 'anti-semitism', 'fact', 'THE', 'BELIEVER', 'Jews', 'positive', 'light', 'group', 'can', 'endure', 'unremitting', 'agony', 'degree', 'Daniel', 'synonymous', 'welcoming', 'agony', 'end', 'audience', 'Daniel', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'believe', 'necessity', 'endure', 'blind', 'hatred', 'two', 'milennia', 'old', 'hatred', 'Faulknerian', 'virtue', 'not', 'Hitlerian', 'vice']",N/A

I found the plot to be somewhat far-fetched, and while even then I recognized Gosling's amazing performance, I just didn't fully comprehend the film. I just watched this film again-twice more actually-and it's significance really hit me this time. Watching the interview with director Henry Bean (in the Special Features section) along with reading some of the comments by Jewish reviewers really helped me in this regard. It seems that Daniel's struggle with self-hatred and rebellion against his religion is somewhat typical-although clearly taken to the extreme here-of many Jewish people. Taken in this context, Danny's ""anti-semitism"" is not exactly as it seems. Halfway through the film, it becomes clear that Danny still cherishes his religion, even if he simultaneously resents it. So rather than the ignorant Jew-hatred of his buddies, Danny's anti-semitism is more of a tormented personal rebellion against his religion, his people and God himself. Then there's Bean's concept of Danny being a ""Rabbi in spite of himself."" Admittedly, I don't fully understand this, but it definitely adds to the film's fascinating complexity. So while at first glance this is simply a story about a ""Jewish Nazi"" the film is much more complex than it seems, and that's what really makes this a great film. With that said, I'd like to point out that self-hatred is not something unique to Jews, or minorities for that matter. A previous reviewer compares Danny to Michael Jackson who bleached his skin in order to ""fit-in with WASP society."" Not only is this a ridiculous PC statement, but this reviewer has completely misjudged the film. Do you really think a gun-toting neo-nazi ""fits-in"" better in American society than a Jew? I think one of the reasons this film moved me so much was that I strongly identified with Daniel. Although I am not Jewish (I was born and raised a suburban, middle-class Irish-Catholic), I completely related with his tormented, self-denying, and self-destructive mentality.

In effect he has become a Jewish Nazi.  But why?In flashbacks we see how as a brilliant youth he questioned those religious teachings and was thrown out of his religious school.  It seems his hatred of Jews in general stems from a hatred of their inability to fight back during WWII.  No matter how much he is motivated to kill Jews, at heart he is still a Jew. It is the story of an intelligent, confused man, conflicted internally between what he thinks he believes and what is his real identity.This is a powerful drama, the acting is excellent and the topic hard to watch.

One thinks of the world in which we live in, where there should be enough information about damaging philosophy such as fascism. But we get to learn that young Daniel is no dummy.  He is articulate and complicated.  He is perhaps too aware of his Jewishness and hates it.  The hatered, anger, self loathing and helplessness lead him to violence because there are no other avenues for him left to explore.  His memories from early childhood when he spent time attending Jewish religious classes, debating with his schoolmates and Yeshiva teacher are over.  While in school  he had no equal in debates.  Now that he was no longer part of the system he had no one to debate him.  The isolation, inability to identify and relate to anyone or any group turns him to violence that is his only means to relieve his frustration.  Even amongst neo-nazi groups he learns about betrayal's and disappointments of different kinds.  In wanting to destruct other (Jews) he truly wants ot destroy himself.  Perhaps death would lead him to God that is the only one that can give him answers to his questions.  Or perhaps death will give him a chance to another life -- calmer, less complicated and more fulfilling. Or perhaps it will end up being a perpetual torment of another kind where self-exploration, questioning and doubt are endless.  Ryan Gosling's performance is at his best.

737099,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00008AOSA,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","The Believer (Henry Bean, 2001)Veteran screenwriter Henry Bean (Internal Affairs, Deep Cover) steps behind the camera for the first time in The Believer, which stars Ryan Gosling (Breaker High) as an anti-Semitic fascist who also happens to be a Jew. The movie premiered at Sundance in 2001 to great acclaim, then was shelved halfway through a distribution deal thanks to protests from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. (It finally did a achieve a very limited theatrical release in May of 2002 in New York City, but for most of the country, it's straight-to-video.)The film is roughly what one would expect from this kind of film being made in today's political climate; bad boy surrounds himself with other bad boys, but finds redemption in the end. The beauty of the film, however, lies in how Gosling's character achieves redemption (it could, in fact, be argued that he never does; he is without doubt conflicted until, and after, the movie's very last frame). Rather than the ""befriend a minority"" tactic of American History X or the ""let's listen to holocaust survivors"" tactic of a hundred other previous films (both of which, in fact, get some airplay here with much more realistic results), the main character in the film starts conflicted; he just doesn't realize it, although we are given enough clues from the get-go to understand what's going on in his head before he does. Once he finally does get it, he's intelligent enough to realize what's going on and fear it, while still desiring it, in some way. In other words, he might be the most intelligent main character in a movie since movies were invented. There's no point after he realizes what's going on where you look at the screen and yell ""don't go in the basement, stupid!"" That alone is enough to make this film noteworthy (and probably banish it into undeserved obscurity forever, since getting something out of this movie requires thought on the part of the viewer-anathema to American moviegoers, for the most part). Because of all this, the movie ends up being extremely unsettling in ways that are impossible to describe. Gosling and Bean force you to identify with Gosling's character, no matter how little you have in common with him, by making him as much an Everyman as possible given his extreme viewpoint (even the other fascists with whom he associates consider him something of a walking time bomb, though they don't hesitate to try and use him to their own ends).This is not necessarily a film to be enjoyed, but it is an important one.

One of the greatest, ironic, moving, and dramatic ideas in a story/movie that I can think of.THE MOVIE:  The movie wasn't as good as it could've been, it being an indepenent film with limited budgiting can do that.

However, i'm not stupid and I don't fall for the hollywood hero that they create for the public.  I DON'T think Gosling is that great of an actor and I KNOW he is overrated.  The only role that I can give him SOME credit for is of course ""The Believer"" for which this review is for.  But, for the most part He just doesn't sound real to me, as if when he says something, it is fake.  Maybe it's his accent or the sound of his voice but whatever it is, I don't see this great actor that holloywood makes him out to be and what other people think he is - mostly girls who think he is ""hot"" and ""love"" him.  Lol, thinking an actor is hot and loving him is fine, but that doesn't make him a great actor.  They just think he is sweet, makes them horny and that's it, lol. And i'm not just pointing out Gosling here, I can name other actors that STINK but are famous or are getting famous because soley of their looks:  Brad Pitt, Viggo Morteson, Josh Hartnett come to mind.  I mean, just watch these people act, there is NOTHING great about these guys...just their faces and lean bodies, which has nothing to do with acting and making a character believable.

Ryan Gosling's performance was spectacular and deserves any comparisons he might get to Edward Norton in AMERICAN HISTORY X (Norton was nominated for an Oscar. . .).  He seems so conflicted throughout the film and conveys this very intimately and explicitly on regular and frequent occasions.  If I had seen it before AHX, I might have given it five stars, but I saw (and loved) AHX several years ago and loved the whole thing.  Several similarities seemed very avoidable, and they only served to make me want to compare the two films--not fair to either.  Where this movie really earns its stars (and perhaps another half or so) is in its frank discussion of some very complex theological issues.  Gosling's character does not mind sharing some fascinating facts about Judaism that I was not previously familiar with, and this feature makes it so much more than a &quot;remake&quot; of AHX.  Rather than Norton's spectacular turnaround--&quot;conversion&quot; if you will--Gosling stays conflicted to the end.  That conflict is very compelling and very unsettling.  It's not a movie I'd want to see over and over again (I don't think), but the one viewing was a great ride and a great example of complicated theological thinking/believing (or not believing. . .).Bottom Line:  If you liked AMERICAN HISTORY X, you should like this movie--it has a similar-sounding premise but takes off in a whole different direction very quickly.

Poignant scenese throughout.  One scene finds the nazis ransacking a temple and our antagonist rescuing a Torah scroll from the carnage.  He cradles it like a mother holding a baby.Other great scenes include a long drawn out flashback invovling a Jewish man whose boy is murdered in front  of him by the nazis.  We watch as the antagonist goes from wanting to be the nazi to wishing he was the Jewish man so he could take revenge.A wonderful masterpiece of controverisal wisdom about rediscovering yourself through becoming an extremist.  Self hate is a big Jewish topic some may identify with.  Otherwise the film may leave you a little untouched.  Some will be offended but the film really shows itself to be enlightening and very realistic, exposing Nazi propoganda for the filth it is and showing the true joys of Jewish faith.",5,the best film of the year,1064620800,"09 27, 2003",2003,1076,"['Jewish', 'Nazi', 'wonderful', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Jew', 'turned', 'nazi', 'then', 'turned', 'Jew', 'again.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'documents', 'long', 'strange', 'path', 'young', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'neo', 'nazi', 'youth', 'leader', 'only', 're', 'discover', 'Poignant', 'scenese', 'One', 'scene', 'nazis', 'ransacking', 'temple', 'antagonist', 'rescuing', 'Torah', 'scroll', 'carnage', 'mother', 'holding', 'baby.Other', 'great', 'scenes', 'include', 'long', 'drawn', 'flashback', 'invovling', 'Jewish', 'man', 'boy', 'murdered', 'front', 'nazis', 'watch', 'antagonist', 'wanting', 'be', 'nazi', 'wishing', 'was', 'Jewish', 'man', 'could', 'take', 'revenge.A', 'wonderful', 'masterpiece', 'controverisal', 'wisdom', 'rediscovering', 'becoming', 'extremist', 'Self', 'hate', 'big', 'Jewish', 'topic', 'may', 'identify', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'may', 'leave', 'little', 'untouched', 'will', 'be', 'offended', 'film', 'really', 'be', 'enlightening', 'very', 'realistic', 'exposing', 'Nazi', 'propoganda', 'filth', 'showing', 'true', 'joys', 'Jewish', 'faith']",N/A

The movie won an award at Sundance in 2001and it is easy to see why it deserves to be honored. The Believer is deeply disturbing, but the qualities which make the film rather disturbing also makes it convincing. The expression there is a fine line between love and hate aptly fits this film. The protagonist has a love/hate relationship with his Jewish heritage, which drives him to extremes. It is a masterfully written piece about an angry young man named Daniel Biliant played masterfully by Ryan Gossling. We meet Danny as this fascist neo-Nazi. He has a deep hatred for Jewish people, but he also has a vast knowledge about the Jewish faith. He claims his reason for his hatred is due to his belief that one has to know one's enemies. The truth is that he is wrestling with the pain and tragedy of Jewish history and cannot understand in his mind at least, why the Jewish people never fought back. Danny's faith and questions haunt him throughout the film, and a conversion of heart seems about ready to take place quite a few times, but viewers will have to decide if a conversion ever takes place, and given the complex nature of this film, the answers could be quite varied.The film exposes the complete absurdity of anti-Semitism. It also exposes hatred so well, this film will challenge all viewers to look squarely at prejudice, and the irrationality of prejudice. We also meet well dressed ""Yuppie"" fascists as well as skinhead punks in the film, showing that hatred can show its ugly face in any setting, regardless of wealth and education.It's too bad that the film did not receive greater attention when it was first released in theatres. Its powerful message has lessons that our country still needs to hear, and perhaps in this post 9-11 world, we need to reexamine the message of this film as we try and understand hatred, and the damage that hatred has done, can do, and will continue to do, until the issue is looked at squarely.",5,"Disturbing, Provocative, but Worthwhile",1057449600,"07 6, 2003",2003,2033,"['When', 'film', 'such', 'Believer', 'film', 'highest', 'praise', 'movie', 'won', 'award', 'Sundance', '2001and', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'be', 'honored', 'Believer', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'qualities', 'make', 'film', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'also', 'convincing', 'expression', 'fine', 'line', 'love', 'hate', 'aptly', 'film', 'protagonist', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Jewish', 'heritage', 'extremes', 'masterfully', 'written', 'piece', 'angry', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Daniel', 'Biliant', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Ryan', 'Gossling', 'meet', 'Danny', 'fascist', 'neo-Nazi', 'deep', 'hatred', 'Jewish', 'people', 'also', 'vast', 'knowledge', 'Jewish', 'faith', 'reason', 'hatred', 'due', 'belief', 'one', 'know', 'one', 'enemies', 'truth', 'wrestling', 'pain', 'tragedy', 'Jewish', 'history', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'mind', 'least', 'why', 'Jewish', 'people', 'never', 'fought', 'back', 'Danny', 'faith', 'questions', 'haunt', 'film', 'conversion', 'heart', 'ready', 'take', 'place', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'conversion', 'ever', 'place', 'given', 'complex', 'nature', 'film', 'answers', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'varied.The', 'film', 'complete', 'absurdity', 'anti-Semitism', 'also', 'hatred', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'will', 'challenge', 'viewers', 'look', 'squarely', 'prejudice', 'irrationality', 'prejudice', 'also', 'meet', 'well', 'dressed', 'Yuppie', 'as', 'well', 'skinhead', 'punks', 'film', 'showing', 'hatred', 'can', 'show', 'ugly', 'face', 'setting', 'regardless', 'wealth', 'education.It', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'greater', 'attention', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theatres', 'powerful', 'message', 'lessons', 'country', 'still', 'hear', 'perhaps', 'post', '9-11', 'world', 'need', 'reexamine', 'message', 'film', 'try', 'understand', 'hatred', 'damage', 'hatred', 'done', 'can', 'do', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'issue', 'looked', 'squarely']",N/A

It deals with the thorny issue of the Jewish Nazi; whilst it sounds like an oxymoron it is similar to the working class Tory (or supporting Capitalism) etc. Further it is not too much of a stretch to understand how people can reject their religion especially when theology leaves so much unanswered and instead expects `blind faith' to be the mortar that holds all the other stuff together.Ryan Gosling plays Danny Balint who is a skinhead in modern day America with a penchant for wearing a swastika on his t-shirt (it wasn't even acceptable in punk). He has rejected the Torah from an early stage and has done so by questioning what it asks a Jew to do, be and believe. His outbursts as a youth (seen in flashback) are as reasonable as a Roman Catholic questioning the belief in transubstantiation, but as with a Priest a Rabbi just aint having any of it - so he gets kicked out. Such treatment of a brilliant scholar only adds to the feeling of both alienation and anomie. Thus leaving a gap that needs to be fulfilled and so Nazi dogma fills the void. This technically makes him self hating.Enough of the religious stuff; he joins a Neo-Nazi group headed up by Billy Zane as a be wigged Curtis Zampf. He not only wants to teach anti-Semitism but declares he wants to kill a Jew. Thus the scene is set for his journey into self discovery and a kind of rude awakening and some violence but not too much.As a film it holds together fairly well but mostly because of the blistering diatribes from Gosling as Danny, who comes across as very believable. There is some love interest with some bedroom scenes seemingly shoe horned into the plot. There is some violence and lessons in how not to set explosives. There is also a bit of s and m and a lot of religious theorizing and middle class justification of racism.This is not a bad film but it also is not one of those that changes your world view. It was made on such a small budget that they could not afford licences for the location filming, which will explain the varying levels of quality through out. Still director Henry Bean has made a thought provoking film that is hard to categorize, it is based on the true story of a member of the KKK who was outed as a Jew in the 1960's. All in all not a bad effort but the ending may be disappointing for some. If you like your films slightly quirky and are not afraid to deal with uncomfortable subjects then this may well be for you.",4,"""Know Your Enemy""",1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2502,"['one', 'had', 'been', 'meaning', 'get', 'time', 'thorny', 'issue', 'Jewish', 'Nazi', 'whilst', 'oxymoron', 'similar', 'working', 'class', 'Tory', 'supporting', 'Capitalism', 'etc', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'stretch', 'understand', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'reject', 'religion', 'especially', 'when', 'theology', 'so', 'much', 'unanswered', 'instead', 'blind', 'faith', 'be', 'mortar', 'other', 'stuff', 'Gosling', 'plays', 'Danny', 'Balint', 'who', 'skinhead', 'modern', 'day', 'America', 'penchant', 'wearing', 'swastika', 't-shirt', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'acceptable', 'punk', 'rejected', 'Torah', 'early', 'stage', 'done', 'so', 'questioning', 'what', 'Jew', 'do', 'be', 'believe', 'outbursts', 'youth', 'seen', 'flashback', 'are', 'as', 'reasonable', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'questioning', 'belief', 'transubstantiation', 'Priest', 'Rabbi', 'just', 'aint', 'having', 'so', 'kicked', 'out', 'Such', 'treatment', 'brilliant', 'scholar', 'only', 'feeling', 'alienation', 'anomie', 'Thus', 'leaving', 'gap', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'so', 'Nazi', 'dogma', 'void', 'technically', 'self', 'hating.Enough', 'religious', 'stuff', 'Neo-Nazi', 'group', 'headed', 'up', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'be', 'wigged', 'Curtis', 'Zampf', 'not', 'only', 'teach', 'anti-Semitism', 'kill', 'Jew', 'Thus', 'scene', 'set', 'journey', 'self', 'discovery', 'kind', 'rude', 'awakening', 'violence', 'not', 'too', 'much.As', 'film', 'together', 'fairly', 'well', 'mostly', 'blistering', 'diatribes', 'Gosling', 'Danny', 'who', 'very', 'believable', 'love', 'interest', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'seemingly', 'shoe', 'horned', 'plot', 'violence', 'lessons', 'how', 'not', 'set', 'explosives', 'also', 'bit', 's', 'm', 'lot', 'religious', 'theorizing', 'middle', 'class', 'justification', 'racism.This', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'also', 'not', 'one', 'world', 'view', 'was', 'made', 'such', 'small', 'budget', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'licences', 'location', 'filming', 'will', 'explain', 'varying', 'levels', 'quality', 'out', 'Still', 'director', 'Henry', 'Bean', 'made', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'hard', 'categorize', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'member', 'KKK', 'who', 'was', 'outed', 'Jew', '1960', 'not', 'bad', 'effort', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'disappointing', 'like', 'films', 'slightly', 'quirky', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'deal', 'uncomfortable', 'subjects', 'then', 'may', 'well', 'be']",N/A

The movie has been quite controversial, and it was shown originally on cable when the studio that made it decided not to release it in theaters, even though it won awards at Sundance.  It was filmed in a raw, almost documentary manner, but it's not really gratuitous.  Clearly, it's meant to provoke the viewer into thinking critically about issues of anti-semitism, religion, hatred, and so forth.  On that level, it succeeds.  ""The Believer"" is the type of movie that is likely to elicit a great deal of conversation if you watch it with your friends.Some viewers may compare it to ""American History X,"" but I think that ""the Believer"" is a much more complex and realistic portrait of aliented youth and hatred.  The most frightening aspect of the movie is that it forces the viewer to understand (but not neccesarily sympathize with) the lead character.  Ryan Gosling gives a raw, believable star-making performance.  Obviously, many viewers may be (justifiably) offended by this movie, but if you're open then give ""The Believer"" a try.

Love it or hate it (and this is a movie that could easily inspire both views), ""The Believer"" will almost certainly make you think.  Telling the story of a Jewish neo-Nazi named Danny Balint, the movie is a harrowing examination of the nature of belief and self-perception, every bit as provocative and hard-hitting as the better-known ""American History X.""  Although the idea of a Jew who hates his own people may seem contradictory, the movie reconciles it very well.  Through frequent flashbacks to Danny's Yeshiva class, the audience sees that Danny feels God is a bully and the entire history of the Jewish people is one of weakness and submission.  Although much of his propaganda is just tired repetition of Nazi beliefs, Ryan Gosling's performance invests what he says with undeniable conviction.  Danny's hatred is deeply rooted in his childhood experiences, and unlike many of his skinhead bullies, he *believes*.  At the same time, Danny seems conflicted about what exactly it is that he believes.  In one scene vitriolic anti-Semitic sentiments are pouring out of his mouth, in another he's repairing a sacred Jewish scroll that his friends have damaged.  No matter how hard Danny tries to reject his roots, it seems the connection to them is too strong to sever completely.  I think what ""The Believer"" was trying to get at is the confusion young people experience between accepting what they're taught and forging their own beliefs.  Danny clearly has strong feelings and wants to believe *something*, but is having trouble figuring out what it is.  In that sense, ""The Believer"" is about as apt a title for a movie as I've ever heard.  It can be viewed in its most obvious form as a cautionary tale about the seductive nature and the dangerous potential of hatred, but that's a somewhat narrow view.  What I thought the makers of the film were really going for was an examination of the difficulty young people can have in finding both their place in the world and their own belief system.
