1202707,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B001HZ4K7G,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[19, 19]","This is another DVD from Acacia that offers two 20-minute workouts plus separate warm-up and cool-down segments. It is led by Kristen McGee, a Pilates and yoga instructor, and it offers Pilates matwork at a high intermediate to advanced level. However, Kristen spices things up a bit by adding cardio bursts throughout both Pilates workouts.The Main Menu of the DVD read as follows:IntroductionWorkout OptionsBonus FeaturesAlso From AcaciaCreditsIf you select ""Workout Options,"" here are your choices:Play All (53 Min)Warm-Up (7 Min)Fat-Burning Flow 1 (20 Min)-->With Introduction: Yes/NOFat-Burning Flow 2 (20 Min)-->With Introduction: Yes/NOCool-Down (6 Min)Warm-Up + Fat-Burning Flow 1 + Cool-Down (33 Min)Warm-Up + Fat-Burning Flow 2 + Cool-Down (33 Min)I decided to try the entire routine my first time through. (Note: one editing flaw is that if you select the ""Play All"" option, the introductions are left in.) The Warm-Up (6.5m) is performed entirely on the mat. Kristen moves slowly, encouraging you to focus on your form as you breathe. Some of the exercises include the bug and floating bridge.Following the Warm-Up comes the first workout, which begins with an approximately 4.5-minute cardio segment. Kristen performs arm circles, leg kicks to the front & side, plies, zip ups, little hops or plyos, and grande plies, repeating the entire sequence once. She then moves to the floor for traditional Pilates matwork moves such as the 100, roll-ups, and the series of five; however, she adds little twists to many of these exercises to increase the intensity. Kristen then repeats the cardio series, performing less repetitions this time through. Then it is back to the floor for more matwork, this time focusing more on moves that target the lower body such as bridge, 1-legged and full teaser, and the seal. The entire Fat-Burning Flow 1 was about 24 minutes long.The second workout also starts with about 4.5 minutes of cardio moves, but this time, the sequence is a bit more high impact, as it includes Pilates jumping jacks, standing side crunches, punches side-to-side, plie jumps, and twisting lunges to either side, repeating once. The Pilates work is performed from an hands and knees position. Kristen performs some knee in-and-out moves as well as a kneeling push-up. She then moves into a series of exercises on one side of the body, such as moving the leg/arm in-and-out and a kneeling side kick series. Following this, she does another cardio segment, but this time, it is done in a plank position and includes jumping in and out, running man, open & close, and ski jumps. Kristen then repeats the one-legged movements on the other side before moving to a prone position, where she performs supermans, heel beats, hamstring curls, elbow plank. This workout, which comes in at 22.5 minutes, concludes with Pilates push-ups.The Cool-Down is just under 6 minutes. Here Kristen combines dynamic and held stretches, concentrating in particular on the hips and the hamstrings; this was a nice conclusion to the workout. The Bonus features on this DVD include a 5-minute Ab Blast. In this segment, Kristen performs a rowing series from a reclined C-curve position, doing a sequence of three movements in the middle and then to either side. She also does and advanced corkscrew combined with the jackknife, and she finishes with the neckpull, adding an ""around-the-world"" twist. (Other Bonus features include the bonus segment from Weight Loss Cardio, a short ""Moves on the Go"" segment that focuses on posture, and Kristen's bio.)As noted above, this is definitely a HIGH intermediate to ADVANCED Pilates workout. I consider myself to be solidly intermediate in Pilates, but there were times that I had to rest/take breaks during the Pilates exercises, as some of Kristen's variations on the moves were quite challenging. I'm still not quite sure how I feel about adding the ""cardio bursts"" to the Pilates workout. I didn't mind the cardio so much at the beginning of the workout, as it felt like a nice way to warm up for the matwork (better in fact than the actual Warm-Up, which felt kind of useless), but I didn't like it as much in the middle of the workout, when it seemed to interrupt the flow of the Pilates matwork. Still, this DVD is nicely done, and I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a challenging Pilates workout that is a bit different from the classical Pilates teachings.",4,Provides a challenge for those intermediate and above in Pilates,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,4419,"['DVD', 'Acacia', 'two', '20-minute', 'workouts', 'separate', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'segments', 'led', 'Kristen', 'McGee', 'Pilates', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'Pilates', 'matwork', 'high', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'level', 'However', 'Kristen', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'adding', 'cardio', 'bursts', 'Pilates', 'workouts.The', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'read', 'IntroductionWorkout', 'OptionsBonus', 'FeaturesAlso', 'From', 'AcaciaCreditsIf', 'select', 'Workout', 'Options', 'here', 'are', 'choices', 'Play', '53', 'Min', 'Warm-Up', '7', 'Min', 'Fat-Burning', 'Flow', '1', '20', 'Min', 'Introduction', 'Yes/NOFat-Burning', 'Flow', '2', '20', 'Min', 'Introduction', 'Yes/NOCool-Down', '6', 'Min', 'Warm-Up', '+', 'Fat-Burning', 'Flow', '1', '+', 'Cool-Down', '33', 'Min', 'Warm-Up', '+', 'Fat-Burning', 'Flow', '2', '+', 'Cool-Down', '33', 'Min', 'decided', 'try', 'entire', 'routine', 'first', 'time', 'Note', 'one', 'editing', 'flaw', 'select', 'Play', 'All', 'option', 'introductions', 'are', 'left', 'Warm-Up', '6.5m', 'performed', 'entirely', 'mat', 'Kristen', 'slowly', 'encouraging', 'focus', 'form', 'breathe', 'exercises', 'include', 'bug', 'floating', 'bridge.Following', 'Warm-Up', 'first', 'workout', 'approximately', '4.5-minute', 'cardio', 'segment', 'Kristen', 'arm', 'circles', 'leg', 'kicks', 'front', 'side', 'plies', 'zip', 'ups', 'little', 'hops', 'plyos', 'grande', 'plies', 'repeating', 'entire', 'sequence', 'once', 'then', 'floor', 'traditional', 'Pilates', 'matwork', 'moves', 'such', '100', 'roll-ups', 'series', 'five', 'however', 'little', 'twists', 'many', 'exercises', 'increase', 'intensity', 'Kristen', 'then', 'cardio', 'series', 'performing', 'less', 'repetitions', 'time', 'Then', 'back', 'floor', 'more', 'matwork', 'time', 'focusing', 'more', 'moves', 'target', 'lower', 'body', 'such', 'bridge', '1-legged', 'full', 'teaser', 'seal', 'entire', 'Fat-Burning', 'Flow', '1', 'was', '24', 'minutes', 'long.The', 'second', 'workout', 'also', '4.5', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'moves', 'time', 'sequence', 'bit', 'more', 'high', 'impact', 'Pilates', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'standing', 'side', 'crunches', 'punches', 'side-to-side', 'plie', 'jumps', 'twisting', 'lunges', 'side', 'repeating', 'once', 'Pilates', 'work', 'performed', 'hands', 'knees', 'position', 'Kristen', 'knee', 'in-and-out', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'kneeling', 'push-up', 'then', 'series', 'exercises', 'one', 'side', 'body', 'such', 'moving', 'leg/arm', 'in-and-out', 'kneeling', 'side', 'kick', 'series', 'Following', 'cardio', 'segment', 'time', 'done', 'plank', 'position', 'jumping', 'running', 'man', 'open', 'close', 'ski', 'jumps', 'Kristen', 'then', 'one-legged', 'movements', 'other', 'side', 'moving', 'prone', 'position', 'where', 'supermans', 'heel', 'beats', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'elbow', 'plank', 'workout', '22.5', 'minutes', 'concludes', 'Pilates', 'push-ups.The', 'Cool-Down', 'just', '6', 'minutes', 'Here', 'Kristen', 'combines', 'dynamic', 'held', 'stretches', 'concentrating', 'particular', 'hips', 'hamstrings', 'was', 'nice', 'conclusion', 'workout', 'Bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', '5-minute', 'Ab', 'Blast', 'segment', 'Kristen', 'rowing', 'series', 'reclined', 'C-curve', 'position', 'doing', 'sequence', 'three', 'movements', 'middle', 'then', 'side', 'also', 'advanced', 'corkscrew', 'combined', 'jackknife', 'neckpull', 'adding', 'around-the-world', 'twist', 'Other', 'Bonus', 'features', 'include', 'bonus', 'segment', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Cardio', 'short', 'Moves', 'Go', 'segment', 'posture', 'Kristen', 'bio', 'noted', 'definitely', 'HIGH', 'intermediate', 'ADVANCED', 'Pilates', 'consider', 'be', 'solidly', 'intermediate', 'Pilates', 'were', 'times', 'had', 'rest/take', 'breaks', 'Pilates', 'exercises', 'Kristen', 'variations', 'moves', 'were', 'quite', 'challenging', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'feel', 'adding', 'cardio', 'bursts', 'Pilates', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'cardio', 'so', 'much', 'beginning', 'workout', 'felt', 'nice', 'way', 'warm', 'up', 'matwork', 'better', 'fact', 'actual', 'Warm-Up', 'felt', 'kind', 'useless', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'much', 'middle', 'workout', 'when', 'seemed', 'interrupt', 'flow', 'Pilates', 'matwork', 'Still', 'DVD', 'nicely', 'done', 'would', 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', 'looking', 'challenging', 'Pilates', 'bit', 'different', 'classical', 'Pilates', 'teachings']",WEIGHT LOSS PILATES

1202709,A1HLC3A2B1SXC,B001HZ4K7G,Danie',"[7, 8]","My mainstay workouts are kickboxing and boot camp style workouts but since I've been doing the same Pilates vid for a while, I decided to pick this one up after seeing that it had something of a ballet element to it (cardio portion of Flow 1).  During the intial viewing, Kristin made it look so easy but believe me, this workout cardio/Pilates combo is no joke!  I dare say it's as hard, if not harder than my kickboxing workouts.  I'm always on the look out for a good inner thigh workout.  THIS IS IT!!  The tops of the inner thighs down to the inner portion of my lower legs were screaming at the end of the first workout (Flow 1).  That has never happened!  I guess I would describe it as that ""zipped up"" feeling that I hear people talk about.  But this one really is not all about the legs, it's a total body workout. Of course, being ambitious (ok, just plain stupid) I had to do Flow 2 the very next day. We're talking mountain climbers, punches, push-ups, planks, crunches, jumping jacks.  Oh, yeah and Pilates.  Whew!With the warm-up and cool down, both workouts are just over 30 minutes and alternates cardio segments with a Pilates segment.  Flow 1 is more traditional matwork (the 100, teaser, seal) and Flow 2 (IMO, the harder of the two) consists on Pilates moves that are done from the table top position (on hands and knees).Beginners beware:  You just might die!  I actually had to humble myself and downgrade. Yes, it was that serious. Since I truly loved Kristin's style, though, I bought her Pilates for Beginners. But don't think I just shelved Weight Loss Pilates.  Oh no!  It's definitely a keeper! I'm saving it as something to master in the hopefully not so distant future.",5,Killer!!,1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,1700,"['mainstay', 'workouts', 'are', 'kickboxing', 'boot', 'camp', 'style', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'same', 'Pilates', 'vid', 'while', 'decided', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'seeing', 'had', 'something', 'ballet', 'element', 'cardio', 'portion', 'Flow', '1', 'intial', 'viewing', 'Kristin', 'made', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'believe', 'workout', 'combo', 'joke', 'dare', 'say', 'as', 'hard', 'not', 'harder', 'kickboxing', 'workouts', ""'m"", 'always', 'look', 'out', 'good', 'inner', 'thigh', 'workout', 'THIS', 'IT', 'tops', 'inner', 'down', 'inner', 'portion', 'lower', 'legs', 'were', 'screaming', 'end', 'first', 'workout', 'Flow', '1', 'never', 'happened', 'guess', 'would', 'describe', 'zipped', 'up', 'feeling', 'hear', 'people', 'talk', 'one', 'really', 'not', 'legs', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'course', 'being', 'ambitious', 'ok', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'had', 'do', 'Flow', '2', 'very', 'next', 'day', ""'re"", 'talking', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'punches', 'push-ups', 'planks', 'crunches', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Pilates', 'Whew', 'warm-up', 'cool', 'down', 'workouts', 'are', 'just', '30', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'segments', 'Pilates', 'segment', 'Flow', '1', 'more', 'traditional', 'matwork', '100', 'teaser', 'seal', '2', 'IMO', 'harder', 'two', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'are', 'done', 'table', 'top', 'position', 'hands', 'knees', '.Beginners', 'beware', 'just', 'might', 'die', 'actually', 'had', 'humble', 'downgrade', 'Yes', 'was', 'serious', 'truly', 'loved', 'Kristin', 'style', 'bought', 'Pilates', 'Beginners', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'shelved', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Pilates', 'Oh', 'definitely', 'keeper', ""'m"", 'saving', 'something', 'master', 'hopefully', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'future']",WEIGHT LOSS PILATES

This is what makes pilates so challenging and this workout was seriously tough --- which I like.  The instructor was alright for me (i.e., not too annoying) but there were some points that just made me dislike this workout.I thought the view switch between her in the studio and outside in the garden was distracting and added nothing.  At one point, the film cuts to her doing the move outside and, artistically, the focus is on the giant flower in the corner of the screen while she is mostly hidden behind the flower and you can barely see what she is doing.  Ridiculously unhelpful.During some of the matwork, she was facing forward which I also found less than helpful --- having a side shot is easier for me.Lastly, at one point, I believe she does a move with one leg --- then instead of repeating it with the other leg, you do a different move on the other leg.

1202713,A21ROY5FAOJHNN,B001HZ4K7G,L L Blair,"[2, 2]","I have to say, I'm a little perplexed by all the rave reviews this DVD is getting. I don't have a problem with the moves in this workout, it's the direction AND the lack of modifications offered for beginners/people who aren't extremely practiced with pilates. There should be a disclaimer somewhere on the DVD stating that this is NOT for beginners--I'm not a beginner, but I found myself thinking, ""holy crap, if this was my first experience with pilates, I would turn this off in two minutes.""I have a TON of workout DVDs that I love, and the very good instructors tell you what you're about to do/explain WHY you're doing it. Kristen just jumps from move to move, often without a rest between moves and often never giving you any sort of indication of when a rest will come. A lot of times she starts counting from 1 and doesn't tell you when she's going to stop...she simply keeps counting, and you have no idea how long you have to go until it's over.  Once she even went to 14!--why 14? Most instructors either start at the high number or say, ""we're going for 8...."" It may sound petty, but when workouts are very challenging, it's the difference between powering through the last few or saying ""when is this chick gonna stop?"" and then giving up.Also, the second fat burn section is not that great, specifically in that she switches from intense cardio (jumping around, etc.) and IMMEDIATELY has you sit on the ground. I became very dizzy and then realized why.  You don't do that!And just an FYI--the two ""20 minute segments"" are NOT 20 minutes. They're 24. Again, it might sound petty, but when you are struggling and looking at the clock thinking to yourself, ""why is she still going! this is supposed to be ending!"" it can be pretty annoying.

1202715,A3NUTEF2PQEDN6,B001HZ4K7G,"Obama-Mama ""Ballroom Dancer""","[2, 2]","This workout is definitely for those who are familiar with an intermediate to advanced Pilates routine. The cardio portions fit well into the mat/Pilates routine, although working on one's hands to do the vigorous cardio portion on segment two of the workout can cause quite a bit of wrist and shoulder tendinitis strain. Also, it seems that many of the movements are quite rushed, as Pilates was meant to be done in a more focused, concentrated, and refined manner. Sometimes it feels as if Kristin is rather rushing through some of the Pilates exercises without really breaking down the important elements of the movement (this is where an instructional book might be better, as it describes the finer points about a specific exercise for best execution and allows one to achieve the perfect form at one's own pace). Of course, this is meant to be a cardio workout, so it the pace must be maintained to keep the heart rate up, and so technique suffers slightly in the end. However, once I become much more adept at some of the intermediate to advanced Pilates moves on my own, I'm sure this workout will become more pleasant to run through without feeling like I'm being left behind. Kristin is energetic and strong, but just a tad bit too much on the anorexic side, which appears a somewhat concerning if one is trying to convey an image of good health and a reasonable body image of someone who works out regularly. However, this may just be her body type/disposition.",4,Challenging...,1270684800,"04 8, 2010",2010,1472,"['workout', 'definitely', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'Pilates', 'routine', 'cardio', 'portions', 'fit', 'well', 'mat/Pilates', 'routine', 'working', 'one', 'hands', 'do', 'vigorous', 'cardio', 'portion', 'segment', 'two', 'workout', 'can', 'cause', 'quite', 'bit', 'wrist', 'shoulder', 'tendinitis', 'strain', 'Also', 'many', 'movements', 'are', 'quite', 'rushed', 'Pilates', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'done', 'more', 'focused', 'concentrated', 'refined', 'manner', 'Kristin', 'rather', 'rushing', 'Pilates', 'exercises', 'really', 'breaking', 'down', 'important', 'elements', 'movement', 'where', 'instructional', 'book', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'finer', 'points', 'specific', 'exercise', 'best', 'execution', 'one', 'achieve', 'perfect', 'form', 'one', 'own', 'pace', 'course', 'meant', 'be', 'cardio', 'workout', 'pace', 'must', 'be', 'maintained', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'so', 'technique', 'suffers', 'slightly', 'end', 'However', 'once', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'adept', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'own', ""'m"", 'sure', 'workout', 'will', 'become', 'more', 'pleasant', 'run', 'feeling', ""'m"", 'being', 'left', 'behind', 'Kristin', 'energetic', 'strong', 'just', 'tad', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'anorexic', 'side', 'somewhat', 'concerning', 'one', 'trying', 'convey', 'image', 'good', 'health', 'reasonable', 'body', 'image', 'someone', 'who', 'out', 'regularly', 'However', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'body', 'type/disposition']",WEIGHT LOSS PILATES

The workout is broken up into 2 20 minutes sessions (actually, with warm up/cool down the video is closer to an hour). The separate sessions are convenient when I'm short on time. The instructor is super cute and not at all annoying. The workout is challenging, but quite fun. I can feel the difference in my body from doing this workout. Workout concentrates on the core, but does benefit the entire body. I highly recommend this video.",5,"Awesome, effective, upbeat workout",1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,547,"['LOVE', 'video', 'several', 'sessions', 'am', 'still', 'challenged', 'consider', 'intermediate/advanced', 'workout', 'broken', 'up', '2', '20', 'minutes', 'sessions', 'actually', 'warm', 'up/cool', 'video', 'closer', 'hour', 'separate', 'sessions', 'are', 'convenient', 'when', ""'m"", 'short', 'time', 'instructor', 'super', 'cute', 'not', 'annoying', 'workout', 'challenging', 'quite', 'fun', 'can', 'feel', 'difference', 'body', 'doing', 'workout', 'Workout', 'core', 'benefit', 'entire', 'body', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video']",WEIGHT LOSS PILATES
1202717,A2HL1HNB36RE2Y,B001HZ4K7G,"reviewer ""spylo""","[0, 2]",This is a very difficult workout. It's not for beginners.. I am a pretty intermediate exerciser with experience with all types of workouts. Nothing is ever too too challenging for me. However this is one of the hardest Pilates workouts I have ever done. I gave it 3 stars because there is a fault in the practice that Kristen makes. During the Pilates teaser portion Kristen works one side of the abs significantly more than the other so it's not even...It looks as if she ran out of time?? Also she looks incredibly skinny. It's really hard to look at an instructor that quite frankly looks unhealthy and too thin. Why would anyone take advice from her? Weight loss no less?! Also she zips through all the exercises..it's like she is just trying to rush through it all...I recommend watching this DVD a few times before you actually practice it. Like I said ..good hard workout - with a few flaws,3,it's ok,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,897,"['very', 'difficult', 'workout', 'not', 'beginners..', 'am', 'pretty', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'experience', 'types', 'workouts', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'too', 'too', 'challenging', 'However', 'one', 'hardest', 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'fault', 'practice', 'Kristen', 'Pilates', 'teaser', 'portion', 'Kristen', 'one', 'side', 'abs', 'significantly', 'more', 'other', 'not', 'even', 'ran', 'time', 'Also', 'incredibly', 'skinny', 'really', 'hard', 'look', 'instructor', 'quite', 'frankly', 'unhealthy', 'too', 'thin', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'take', 'advice', 'Weight', 'loss', 'less', 'Also', 'exercises..it', 'just', 'trying', 'rush', 'recommend', 'watching', 'DVD', 'few', 'times', 'actually', 'practice', 'said', '..good', 'hard', 'workout', 'few', 'flaws']",WEIGHT LOSS PILATES
1202718,A3SUT3UY2ZI7SJ,B001HZ4K7G,S. Kang,"[1, 1]","I really like this dvd obviously, so I rated it 5 stars. I first heard about Kristin McGee through the Bethanny Frankel dvd. I saw the sample clip and read the reviews. I didn't like how Bethanny Frankel kept complaining throughout the dvd, so I decided not purchasing it. However, the people in the reviews mentioned the dvd was good because of Kristin. So, I looked her up and found this dvd. Another reason I decided to buy this dvd was because I read the workout would be challenging and I wanted to get into pilates. This past year, I was doing yoga. Anyways I like this dvd because it has the option of doing short routine and a long routine. Sometimes it can be hard to workout because I am a mom/wife/student and Kristin's workout are great for my schedule. Besides, I hope one day my body will look good as hers. Also I wanted to let people know that you can try out her workout if you have Time Warner. On your remote control if you press 'A' then look for exercisetv then you can try the different workouts and part of this dvd is there. I recommend trying out this workout and others as well before buying the dvds.
