Fine. So long as it is true to the overall &quot;feel&quot; of the book, I won't give a whimper.That said, I really did not like this movie. (I shan't refer to where it diverges from the book, I will simply judge it on it's merits as an epic.) The tendancy lately of period pieces is to take cliches long abandoned by their respective genres and thrust them into time periods where they do not belong. Examples you say? Glad you asked!Killing messengers. Left and right. And in very hammy ways. Giving the damsel a sword (as if she would want to use it, she'd stain her dress!) What was the point there? Graphicly showing all of the death scenes. Yes, I realize the middle ages were no picnic but really, there is such a thing as good taste and it is not exercised in this case.I really wanted to like this movie and I gave it a valiant try but it was frankly too gross. If blood guts and writhing in agony don't disturb, fine, whatever makes you happy. I just wish there had been some sort of warning.PS The Knights Templar were certainly corrupt (that is rightly portrayed in this case) but no more so than your average knightly order of that size. Also, it is generally accepted by historians that they were executed so that rulers could access their massive wealth more than for corruption or heresy.In conclusion, if this sort of thing is to your taste, I suppose you should go for it.

The storyline is very consistent with Walter Scott famous novel and the actors are extremely good. I loved the subplot with Ivanhoe and Rebecca, never fully explored before in another movies or TV series but very clearly delineated in the book , the insinuation that perhaps Ivanhoe would prefer marrying Rebecca instead of his childhood girlfriend Rowena, but dismissed by Rebecca because she, very wisely understood that a marriage between a Christian and a Jewess in the period would be misunderstood by his father and her father also (and by society). The white lie she tells Rowena that she is entering a convent and becoming christian, and in the end she is going to Spain (then a country half-Muslim, half-Christian, where the Muslims invited the Jews to live freely)with her father seemed the best solution to an impossible love (this scene does not appear in the book, perhaps the script writers inserted it for closure in the story of Rebecca). I loved the TV series very much but there is a slight correction I would like to rectify. The DVD is presented as having closed-captions in english but it is not true. My TV has closed-captions capabilities and I have many DVDs with closed-captions and Ivanhoe does not have them! So if you are buying this TV series be aware of this misinformation.

Steven Waddington (as Ivanhoe) heads a strong supporting cast that includes Nick Brimble (""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"") as the villainous Front-De-Bouef, Ronald Pickup (""Fortunes Of War""; see my review on it) as Prince John's scheming counsellor Waldemar Fitzurse, Cirian Hinds (""The Mayor Of Castorbridge,"" ""The Phantom Of The Opera""; see my review on it) as the lecherous Brian De Bois-Guilbert, James Cosmo (""The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe""; see my review on it) as Cedric the Saxon and horror screen legend Christopher Lee (best known for the 1958 film ""The Horror Of Dracula""; his many screen credits include the evil Rochefort in ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" and the title role in the James Bond thriller ""The Man With The Golden Gun""), making his first appearance for the BBC in 50 years (next year, it will be 60), as the menacing Grand Master, Lucas DeBeaumenoir. Very strong cast.Of all these actors, I think Christopher Lee's performance was the best. He is simply well-cast as a villain (though he also makes a very credible good guy). It is interesting to note that, like Basil Rathbone, he also played the greatest fictional detective of all time, Sherlock Holmes, of 221B Baker Street. I haven't seen him in the role, but he must have done a good job.There have been several other film versions of this story, notably the 1952 costume drama starring Robert Taylor, Joan Fontaine and Elizabeth Taylor and a 1982 made-for-TV movie starring Anthony Andrews, Olivia Hussey (best known for her performance in Franco Zefferelli's classic version of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo & Juliet""; see my review on it) and James Mason (also an excellent screen villain; see Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" and Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea""). While they are excellent, within their own scope, this mini-series surpasses them all. Read the novel before diving into this entertaining movie. Right up there with the BBC's ""Pride & Prejudice"" and HBO's ""Elizabeth I"" (see my reviews on both these excellent TV movies).

However, as an adaptation of a classic novel, it is absolutely terrible and utterly disappointing. I loved the BBC's Pride and Prejudice, but what they did to Ivanhoe was a massacre. The plot was changed in so many, UNJUSTIFIABLE ways that they completely took the spirit of the book away. They added a little too much murderous intrigue and too much physical romance between Rebecca and Ivanhoe. That, and while I liked Susan Lynch for her acting, she really didn't look the part of the drop-dead gorgeous Jewess she was supposed to be. (Rowena, however, was pleasantly much prettier than the cover pictures show her to be.)Overall, the book was an awesome story and needed very little alterations.

Although I haven't watched the 1982 adaptation of this film yet, I feel that I can safely say that this version is undoubtedly my favourite. No - for the sceptics out there this film is not an absolutely faithful rendition of Sir Walter Scott's novel but it successfully conveys the character and plot developments expressed by Sir Walter. I enjoyed the film so much that it forced me to read the quite lengthy and tedious novel over and over again.Ciaran Hinds being one of my all time favourites definitely did not disappoint as Bois-Guilbert. But does he ever? I must admit that he was also my initial attraction to the film as the novel is not one I greatly enjoy eventhough it is an amazing piece of literature. Although George Sanders gave a magnificent performance as Bois-Guilbert in the 1952 version and was supporting Robert Taylor's timeless performance, Hinds is not only perfect for the part but he also upstages Steven Waddington who plays the leading role of Ivanhoe in this version. Waddington is very good but Hinds is awesome and still is the main reason why I never tire from repeatedly watching this film and reading the novel. Susan Lynch is quite remarkable as Rebecca. She is just as good as Elizabeth Taylor and suits the part equally. However, Victoria Smurfit who plays Rowena is a bit bland for my liking. Joan Fontaine's admirable performance is greatly superior.Compared to the 1952 adaptation, this version gives the viewer more insight into the characters' relationships, personalities and the reasons for many of their actions which are illustrated thoughout the novel. The animosity between King Richard and Prince John is particularly more accurately portrayed as opposed to the 1952 version.This film is so well manufactured that it makes you enjoy Sir Walter Scott's classic much much more.

Bernabo,"[50, 51]","It seems strange that the title character of the 1997 version of Sir Walter Scott's ""Ivanhoe"" would end up being one of the least interesting characters in this six-part mini-series, but this is not the fault of actor Steven Waddington.  Television writer Deborah Cook (""The House of Elliot,"" ""The Royal"") has simply made so many of the other characters more interesting and the cast is quite stellar, especially given how few of them I instantly recognized.  But by the time the Ivanhoe/Rebecca/Brian de Bois-Guilbert love triangle is being played on to its tragic end, the Ivanhoe/Rowena/Athelstane one seems rather mundane in comparison.The quintessential novel about chivalry, ""Ivanhoe"" is set about a century after the Battle of Hastings, so that there is still conflict between the ruling Normans and the defeated Saxons in England.  King Richard (Rory Edwards) is taken prisoner on his way back from the Crusades and is being held for ransom and his younger brother, Prince John (Ralph Brown) is beginning to enjoy being the de facto monarch of England.  The story told throughout England is that it was Ivanhoe (Waddington) who betrayed Richard, which is why Ivanhoe's father, Cedric (James Cosmo) refuses to allow his son's name to be uttered in his castle.  Cedric is a Saxon noble who had thrown out his son for falling in love with the Lady Rowena (Victoria Smurfit), Cedric's ward.  Now Cedric hopes to marry Rowena to Athelstane (Chris Walker), another powerful Saxon Lord.Ivanhoe returns to England, disguised as a pilgrim, where he befriends a couple of Jews, Isaac of York (David Horovitch), and his daughter Rebecca (Susan Lynch).  When Ivanhoe sees how the Normans are treating the Saxons he challenges Prince John's best knights in a jousting tournament: Maurice De Bracy (Valentine Pelka), Front-de-Boeuf (Nick Brimble), and Brian de Bois-Guilbert (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds).  Of course, Ivanhoe wins the tournament, but is wounded in the process and has to be cared for by Rebecca, who is a healer.  At this point, things start to become very complicated.Because this is a mini-series we are able to enjoy every one of Scott's plots complications in ""Ivanhoe.""  We have Ivanhoe trying to get in his father's good graces once again, determined to clear his name, and trying to win back the Lady Rowena.  There is the entire political question of John trying to take over the throne and whether the Saxons will start a civil war.  Meanwhile, De Bracy is interested in Rowena and Bois-Guilbert becomes fixated on Rebecca.  Then Lucard de Beaumanoir (Christopher Lee), the head of the Knights Templar shows up to wreck havoc.  All of this is without talking about King Richard meeting up with Robin of Loxley (Aden Gillett), Friar Tuck (Ron Donachie), Little John (David Nicholls) and the rest of the men of Sherwood Forest, who have a few bones to pick with their monarch for abandoning the nation to go off crusading.  By the time Elinor of Aquitaine (Sin Phillips) shows up as a regina ex machina, you will be surprised that everything has ended up being resolved one way or another.The production values for this version of ""Ivanhoe"" do not allow for a lot of bodies walking around as background figures, but production designers Adele Marolf and Michael Trevor make sure this is a grimy, gritty, dirty world and not one in which knights wear shiny armor.  But beyond the look of this ""Ivanhoe"" there are literally well over a dozen great performances.  For once Prince John looks like he could pull off his coup and this Ivanhoe actually gets angry and physical when he finally confronts his father.  Then you have Wamba (Jimmy Chisholm) and Gurth (Trevor Cooper), stealing pretty much every scene either one of them is in from start to finish, although the same can be said for Christopher Lee.  But the standout performance belongs to Ciar&aacute;n Hinds who transforms the troubled Brian de Bois-Guilbert into a tragic figure and the most interesting character in the bunch, especially since his character is the capstone to the resolution of the story.",5,Scott's tale of chivalry played out by a superb cast,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,4074,"['strange', 'title', 'character', '1997', 'version', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Scott', 'Ivanhoe', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'least', 'interesting', 'characters', 'six-part', 'mini-series', 'not', 'fault', 'actor', 'Steven', 'Waddington', 'Television', 'writer', 'Deborah', 'Cook', 'House', 'Elliot', 'Royal', 'simply', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'more', 'interesting', 'cast', 'quite', 'stellar', 'especially', 'given', 'how', 'few', 'instantly', 'recognized', 'time', 'Ivanhoe/Rebecca/Brian', 'de', 'Bois-Guilbert', 'love', 'triangle', 'being', 'played', 'tragic', 'end', 'Ivanhoe/Rowena/Athelstane', 'one', 'rather', 'mundane', 'comparison.The', 'quintessential', 'novel', 'chivalry', 'Ivanhoe', 'set', 'century', 'Battle', 'Hastings', 'so', 'still', 'conflict', 'ruling', 'Normans', 'defeated', 'Saxons', 'England', 'King', 'Richard', 'Rory', 'Edwards', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'way', 'back', 'Crusades', 'being', 'held', 'ransom', 'younger', 'brother', 'Prince', 'John', 'Ralph', 'Brown', 'beginning', 'enjoy', 'being', 'de', 'facto', 'monarch', 'England', 'story', 'told', 'England', 'was', 'Ivanhoe', 'Waddington', 'who', 'betrayed', 'Richard', 'why', 'Ivanhoe', 'father', 'Cedric', 'James', 'Cosmo', 'allow', 'son', 'name', 'be', 'uttered', 'castle', 'Cedric', 'Saxon', 'noble', 'who', 'had', 'thrown', 'out', 'son', 'falling', 'love', 'Lady', 'Rowena', 'Victoria', 'Smurfit', 'Cedric', 'ward', 'Now', 'Cedric', 'marry', 'Rowena', 'Athelstane', 'Chris', 'Walker', 'powerful', 'Saxon', 'Lord.Ivanhoe', 'England', 'disguised', 'pilgrim', 'where', 'couple', 'Jews', 'Isaac', 'York', 'David', 'Horovitch', 'daughter', 'Rebecca', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'When', 'Ivanhoe', 'how', 'Normans', 'are', 'treating', 'Saxons', 'Prince', 'John', 'best', 'knights', 'jousting', 'tournament', 'Maurice', 'De', 'Bracy', 'Valentine', 'Pelka', 'Front-de-Boeuf', 'Nick', 'Brimble', 'Brian', 'Bois-Guilbert', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'course', 'Ivanhoe', 'tournament', 'wounded', 'process', 'be', 'cared', 'Rebecca', 'who', 'healer', 'point', 'things', 'start', 'become', 'very', 'complicated.Because', 'mini-series', 'are', 'able', 'enjoy', 'one', 'Scott', 'plots', 'complications', 'Ivanhoe', 'have', 'Ivanhoe', 'trying', 'get', 'father', 'good', 'graces', 'once', 'again', 'determined', 'clear', 'name', 'trying', 'win', 'back', 'Lady', 'Rowena', 'entire', 'political', 'question', 'John', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'throne', 'Saxons', 'will', 'start', 'civil', 'war', 'Meanwhile', 'De', 'Bracy', 'interested', 'Rowena', 'Bois-Guilbert', 'becomes', 'fixated', 'Rebecca', 'Then', 'Lucard', 'de', 'Beaumanoir', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'head', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'up', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'talking', 'King', 'Richard', 'meeting', 'up', 'Robin', 'Loxley', 'Aden', 'Gillett', 'Friar', 'Tuck', 'Ron', 'Donachie', 'Little', 'John', 'David', 'Nicholls', 'rest', 'men', 'Sherwood', 'Forest', 'who', 'have', 'few', 'bones', 'pick', 'monarch', 'abandoning', 'nation', 'go', 'off', 'crusading', 'time', 'Elinor', 'Aquitaine', 'Sin', 'Phillips', 'up', 'regina', 'ex', 'machina', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'everything', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'resolved', 'one', 'way', 'another.The', 'production', 'values', 'version', 'Ivanhoe', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'lot', 'bodies', 'walking', 'around', 'background', 'figures', 'production', 'designers', 'Adele', 'Marolf', 'Michael', 'Trevor', 'make', 'sure', 'grimy', 'gritty', 'dirty', 'world', 'not', 'one', 'knights', 'wear', 'shiny', 'armor', 'look', 'Ivanhoe', 'are', 'literally', 'well', 'dozen', 'great', 'performances', 'once', 'Prince', 'John', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'coup', 'Ivanhoe', 'actually', 'angry', 'physical', 'when', 'finally', 'father', 'Then', 'have', 'Wamba', 'Jimmy', 'Chisholm', 'Gurth', 'Trevor', 'Cooper', 'stealing', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene', 'one', 'start', 'finish', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'standout', 'performance', 'belongs', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'who', 'troubled', 'Brian', 'de', 'Bois-Guilbert', 'tragic', 'figure', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'bunch', 'especially', 'character', 'capstone', 'resolution', 'story']",N/A

Waddington did a moderately good job with the role, but nothing all together outstanding, Smurfit was a lovely fixture and played a great love smitten stubborn lady but like Waddington a little lackluster.Now Ciaran Hinds on the other hand did an absolutely spectacular job, as did the Rebecca (Susan Lynch) to his Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the Templar Monk. I really believe these two stole the film, while watching it I began to look forward to their scenes together. He is perfectly tormented while she is a woman of her beliefs and virtue but I just kept begging her to say yes! The final scene between Ivanhoe and Guilbert is I think the absolute best scene of the film.Christopher Lee has a small but terrifying role as the Templar Grand Master Lucas de Beaumanoir and James Cosmo is great as the father of Ivanhoe, who you might remember as the mean tough old Scottish man in Braveheart.It really was quite a well done film, with wide shots of some stunning English landscape, with really fine acting from pretty much every actor, with an absolutely beautiful story to wrap it all up in.And I do wish the DVD had subtitles because everyone speaks quite softly.",4,"""I was not brave enough to die for Richard... but for her...""",1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,1310,"['adaptation', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Scott', 'Ivanhoe', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Steven', 'Waddington', 'Rowena', 'played', 'Victoria', 'Smurfit', 'Waddington', 'did', 'moderately', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'nothing', 'together', 'outstanding', 'Smurfit', 'was', 'lovely', 'fixture', 'played', 'great', 'love', 'smitten', 'stubborn', 'lady', 'Waddington', 'little', 'lackluster.Now', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'job', 'did', 'Rebecca', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'Brian', 'Bois-Guilbert', 'Templar', 'Monk', 'really', 'believe', 'two', 'stole', 'film', 'watching', 'began', 'look', 'forward', 'scenes', 'together', 'perfectly', 'tormented', 'woman', 'beliefs', 'virtue', 'just', 'kept', 'begging', 'say', 'yes', 'final', 'scene', 'Ivanhoe', 'Guilbert', 'think', 'absolute', 'best', 'scene', 'film.Christopher', 'Lee', 'small', 'terrifying', 'role', 'Templar', 'Grand', 'Master', 'Lucas', 'de', 'Beaumanoir', 'James', 'Cosmo', 'great', 'father', 'Ivanhoe', 'who', 'might', 'remember', 'mean', 'tough', 'old', 'Scottish', 'man', 'Braveheart.It', 'really', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'wide', 'shots', 'stunning', 'English', 'landscape', 'really', 'fine', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'actor', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'story', 'wrap', 'in.And', 'do', 'wish', 'DVD', 'had', 'subtitles', 'everyone', 'quite', 'softly']",N/A

422389,A1EUFCOZLSAWZP,6304441657,Medieval Lady,"[0, 0]","It is a rare production today that almost perfectly combines exhilarating Drama with Historical accuracy and authenticity. This is one such production. The Sets are excellent, the costumes very authentic and small details really give the viewer a sense of period.One of these is the lighting. In an age then the only non-natural light available came from candles or open fires, it would have been relatively Dark inside even during the day, but especially at night. All too often Medieval historical dramas feature 'floodlit' halls or rooms filled with light, but this does not. As a result many scenes filmed inside are shadowy and not fully visible, but this really works for the Drama. Not only does it provide a great sense of realism (flickering candlelight can be seen in more than one scene) it also helps to make some scenes and incidents more plausible. It is because of the semi-darkness of Cedric's hall, that Ivanhoe is able to conceal his identity from both his father and Bios-Gilbert who are sitting only yards away, visit Rowena without being seen, and escape from the Hall unnoticed.Unlike in some more recent Dramas that programme makers of Ivanhoe did not appear to be under the illusion that the best way to make a medieval Drama 'authentic' and 'realistic' is to include lots of Sex-scenes and gratuitous violence. Ivanhoe is authentic without either of these, and I believe this is testament to the quality of the production and acting, resourcefulness of the makers, and sound historical research.Unlike later BBC productions of a similar genre this series is not blighted by obsessive political correctness that seems to be a feature of such Dramas today. The female Protagonists, Rowena and Rebecca are strong and independent but they are not perfect superwomen as the heroines are in other Dramas, nor feel the need to constantly show that they are better at sword fighting, archery and virtually everything else then the men.Lastly this production features the best Dramatic portrayal of Prince John that I have yet seen in any Drama or movie set in this period. Often John is depicted as an incompetent, bumbling fool, or gullible idiot who goes around acting like a spoiled 8 year old.Here Prince John is brooding, sly, and actually rather clever, though in a sinister way. Ralph Brown's performance gives an excellent measure of the man showing John's paranoia, greed for power, seething resentment of Richard, and a nagging sense of his own inadequacy.Queen Eleanor's stern rebuke of both Brothers in the last episode provides as excellent summary of thier character and shortcoming, as well as giving satisfaction to the audience.My only gripes were some minor inaccuracies or historical details that are based upon popular myths about the middle ages, though these probably come from the book rather than the programme maker's imagination. It is suggested for instance, that is was illegal for women to practice healing, yet this was not the case. Rebecca's activities as a healer lead to her being accused of Witchcraft, when in reality incidents like this were not at all common until the 17th century. This incident is however, essential to the plot so is forgivable.Finally almost all of the Saxon characters seem to openly practice Pagan rituals, or adhere to Pagan beliefs, some even become gradually more pagan as the series progresses. By the 12th century most of the ideas and beliefs espoused by the characters had either been long abandoned or else 'Christianized' to such an extent that they would probably have been well within the boundaries of religious orthodoxy.Admittedly this movie is not always true to the period, but complaints about the inaccuracy of the series in this regard seem a little unfounded in some degree as the novel itself may have been the source of most of the inaccuracies. Personally I think  this series is far more accurate than many Hollywood 'historical' movies.Altogether a brilliant realistic and very pleasing production, perfect in almost every respect.",4,Why dont the BBC make dramas like this today?,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,4034,"['rare', 'production', 'today', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'combines', 'exhilarating', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'accuracy', 'authenticity', 'one', 'such', 'production', 'Sets', 'are', 'excellent', 'costumes', 'very', 'authentic', 'small', 'details', 'really', 'give', 'viewer', 'sense', 'period.One', 'lighting', 'age', 'then', 'only', 'non-natural', 'light', 'available', 'came', 'candles', 'open', 'fires', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'relatively', 'Dark', 'inside', 'even', 'day', 'especially', 'night', 'All', 'too', 'often', 'Medieval', 'historical', 'dramas', 'feature', 'halls', 'rooms', 'filled', 'light', 'not', 'result', 'many', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'inside', 'are', 'shadowy', 'not', 'fully', 'visible', 'really', 'Drama', 'Not', 'only', 'provide', 'great', 'sense', 'realism', 'flickering', 'candlelight', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'one', 'scene', 'also', 'make', 'scenes', 'incidents', 'more', 'plausible', 'semi-darkness', 'Cedric', 'hall', 'Ivanhoe', 'able', 'conceal', 'identity', 'father', 'Bios-Gilbert', 'who', 'are', 'sitting', 'only', 'yards', 'away', 'visit', 'Rowena', 'being', 'seen', 'escape', 'Hall', 'unnoticed.Unlike', 'more', 'recent', 'Dramas', 'programme', 'makers', 'Ivanhoe', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'illusion', 'best', 'way', 'make', 'medieval', 'Drama', ""'authentic"", ""'realistic"", 'include', 'lots', 'Sex-scenes', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'Ivanhoe', 'authentic', 'believe', 'testament', 'quality', 'production', 'acting', 'resourcefulness', 'makers', 'sound', 'historical', 'research.Unlike', 'later', 'BBC', 'productions', 'similar', 'genre', 'series', 'not', 'blighted', 'obsessive', 'political', 'correctness', 'be', 'feature', 'such', 'Dramas', 'today', 'female', 'Protagonists', 'Rowena', 'Rebecca', 'are', 'strong', 'independent', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'superwomen', 'heroines', 'are', 'other', 'Dramas', 'feel', 'need', 'constantly', 'show', 'are', 'better', 'sword', 'fighting', 'archery', 'virtually', 'everything', 'else', 'then', 'men.Lastly', 'production', 'best', 'Dramatic', 'portrayal', 'Prince', 'John', 'have', 'yet', 'seen', 'Drama', 'movie', 'set', 'period', 'Often', 'John', 'depicted', 'incompetent', 'bumbling', 'fool', 'gullible', 'idiot', 'who', 'around', 'acting', 'spoiled', '8', 'year', 'old.Here', 'Prince', 'John', 'brooding', 'sly', 'actually', 'rather', 'clever', 'though', 'sinister', 'way', 'Ralph', 'Brown', 'performance', 'excellent', 'measure', 'man', 'showing', 'John', 'paranoia', 'greed', 'power', 'seething', 'resentment', 'Richard', 'nagging', 'sense', 'own', 'inadequacy.Queen', 'Eleanor', 'stern', 'rebuke', 'Brothers', 'last', 'episode', 'excellent', 'summary', 'thier', 'character', 'shortcoming', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'satisfaction', 'audience.My', 'only', 'gripes', 'were', 'minor', 'inaccuracies', 'historical', 'details', 'are', 'based', 'popular', 'myths', 'middle', 'ages', 'probably', 'come', 'book', 'rather', 'programme', 'maker', 'imagination', 'suggested', 'instance', 'was', 'illegal', 'women', 'practice', 'healing', 'yet', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Rebecca', 'activities', 'healer', 'lead', 'being', 'accused', 'Witchcraft', 'when', 'reality', 'incidents', 'were', 'not', 'common', '17th', 'century', 'incident', 'however', 'essential', 'plot', 'so', 'forgivable.Finally', 'almost', 'Saxon', 'characters', 'seem', 'openly', 'practice', 'Pagan', 'rituals', 'adhere', 'Pagan', 'beliefs', 'even', 'become', 'gradually', 'more', 'pagan', 'series', '12th', 'century', 'most', 'ideas', 'beliefs', 'espoused', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'abandoned', 'else', ""'Christianized"", 'extent', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'boundaries', 'religious', 'orthodoxy.Admittedly', 'movie', 'not', 'always', 'true', 'period', 'complaints', 'inaccuracy', 'series', 'regard', 'seem', 'little', 'unfounded', 'degree', 'novel', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'source', 'most', 'inaccuracies', 'Personally', 'think', 'series', 'far', 'more', 'accurate', 'many', 'Hollywood', ""'historical"", 'movies.Altogether', 'brilliant', 'realistic', 'very', 'pleasing', 'production', 'perfect', 'almost', 'respect']",N/A
422390,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,6304441657,Octavius,"[70, 71]","I greatly enjoyed this rendition of Sir Walter Scott's famous novel. Although there are significant plot deviations, the series is well acted with fantastic costumes and sets true to the period.  The theatrical talent of every single actor in this series was simply outstanding and their great performances made the characters multi-dimensional in scope expressing all the nuances of human nature.Steven Waddington plays a very strong role as Ivanhoe: champion of the absent Richard The Lion Hearted and fiancee of Rowena (Victoria Smurfit), his dear once betrothed who's now promised by his father to Lord Athelstane. Ciar'n Hinds ('Excalibur', HBO's 'Rome') gives probably the best performance as Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert, the evil Templar knight whose hatred for Ivanhoe is as great as his passion for Rebecca (Susan Lynch), the Jewish healer. Lynch as Rebecca herself delivers one of the best performances as a woman whose forbidden passion for Ivanhoe saves the kingdom from the Templars and Prince John. There's even a brief appearance by Sian Philips (I, Claudius) as Elenore D'Aquitaine, the queen mother who comes to arbitrate between her feuding sons John and Richard.  Another outstanding performance was by Christopher Lee (Scaramanga in Bond's 'Man with the Golden Gun) who makes his first performance for the BBC in over 50 years.  His role as the sadistic and zealous Grand Templar is convincing enough to give anyone the creeps.The costumes and armor properly depict the armaments and fashion of the 12th century. The series is filmed on location in Wales showing a few of the many medieval churches, abbeys, manors, and castles that dot its landscape thereby adding to the film's feeling of authenticity. The film is perhaps graphic in violence but this captures the brutality of medieval warfare quite well.  Alltogether a great mini-series that has more positive qualities than shortcomings.

422392,A4FX5YCJA630V,6304441657,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[4, 4]","Though successfully adapted in1952and1982, this mini-series sought to once more tell the story of Sir Walter Scott'sIvanhoe, this time through a lens of gritty realism and fleshed-out characterization. As such, it's a far cry from the glamour and pageantry of the previous film versions, but certainly has worth as an expanded yet largely faithful adaptation of the classic novel. Divided into six 45 minute episodes, this is a fine piece of entertainment, though certainly not for the squeamish (or the very young).Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe returns to England from King Richard's Holy Crusade, hoping to win back the love of both his estranged father and his childhood sweetheart Rowena, only to find that she has been betrothed to another and that tension between the conquered Saxons and their Norman overlords is at an all-time high. Accused of betraying the king (an invention of this particular adaptation), Ivanhoe decides to remain incognito until he gathers the means to clear his name.Elsewhere, Prince John is making plans to usurp his brother's throne, Ivanhoe's father Cedric is making plans for a Saxon uprising, and two Jews - Isaac of York and his daughter Rebecca - are trying to make it safely to a relative's house in a country predisposed to hate them for their faith. All these elements converge on a tournament held in Prince John's honor, one that pits Saxons against Normans, and sows the seeds for the rest of the storyline. Suffice to say that there are dyed-in-the-wool bad guys with their eye on wealth, political advancement and fair ladies, and they're willing to use subterfuge and ambush in order to get what they want.This take on ""Ivanhoe"" remains extremely loyal to most of the novel's plot points while expanding on certain characters and their motivations. It seems almost inevitable that the screenwriter would take the opportunity to add more meat to the love triangles, and as such we get more interaction and intimacy between the likes of Ivanhoe/Rowena, Ivanhoe/Rebecca and Rebecca/Brian. Foregoing the archetypes of the novel, where everyone was painted in bold black-and-white, the characters here have more nuance and complexity. Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on what you think an adaptation should encompass. Storywise, the screenplay is quite faithful to the original text, though with a few flourishes that seem rather unnecessary: the plotline concerning Ivanhoe being falsely accused of treachery fizzles out about halfway through, and Queen Eleanor turns up in a cameo that doesn't really have much to do with anything.Unlike its predecessors, which both take an idealized view of the past, this particular version of ""Ivanhoe"" provides a gritty, realistic view of the Middle Ages, in which everything was dirty, everyone was hairy, and battles were exceptionally brutal. This take on the time period does not sit particularly well with the book's bright pageantry and chivalry (not to mention its wanton anachronisms), but then - that's what the earlier adaptations are for. To its credit, this mini-series decides to do something different with the book's setting, and does so consistently. It is significantly more grisly than anything Scott described: we get vivid images of warfare, of a man burning to death, of a gouged eye, a whipped back and other bloody injuries, as well as a torture scene of Isaac (in the book he was only threatened with it). For some, this element of violence will be gratuitous; for others, it will fit it nicely with the mood and tone chosen for the series.Some of the casting is spot-on to the point where it'll be difficult to re-read the book without imagining these particular cast members. James Cosmo is an obvious choice for Cedric, and Ralph Brown brings a smarmy, ingratiating element to Prince John without going overboard. Jimmy Chisholm is a wry and clever Wamba, and David Horovitch is a much less stereotypical Isaac than in the book (cutting down considerably on the ""greedy Jew"" clich&eacute;).Most notably, Ciaran Hinds portrays Brian de Bois-Guilbert as a more Byronic anti-hero than ever he was in the novel. In fact, it almost threatens to undermine his role in the novel. Whereas Book!Brian offers Rebecca salvation from the flames if she escapes with him (she calls him a ""vile tempter"" and tells him to get lost), this Brian offers her escape with no strings attached - and thus renders Rebecca borderline-stupid when she doesn't seize the opportunity. What's up with our fascination with tormented, dangerous men who think they can find redemption in the love of a woman? These types of relationships have never been my cup of tea, but any woman who loves the creepy interplay of love/violence between Guy and Marian from the BBC'sRobin Hoodwill no doubt enjoy watching Brian try to blackmail Rebecca into becoming his mistress before falling helplessly in love with the strength of her convictions.And of course, Christopher Lee is... well, Christopher Lee. Just stand back and watch him perform. Steven Waddington makes a fine Ivanhoe, though it's difficult to commend a character that (by the novel's design) is so utterly passive and uninteresting until (almost literally) the last five minutes, and King Richard and Robin Hood don't quite have the ""oomph"" factor for two such iconic and larger-than-life figures.But it's the women who really steal the show. So unfairly called ""a frigid piece of propriety"" byWilliam Makepeace Thackeray, the character of Rowena is given plenty of spirit and beauty by Victoria Smurfit, retaining a remarkable sense of agency and influence for a role that essentially requires her to be a distressed damsel and the less interesting love interest. The *more* interesting love interest is of course Rebecca, often described as the true heroine of the novel. Susan Lynch plays her with dignity and poise, vulnerability and strength, wisdom and humor. It's a tour-de-force performance, and there's not a moment she's on camera that you can take your eyes off her.Which leads me to the one thing that did disappoint me greatly. The book ends with a beautiful scene between the two women who know full-well that they're both in love the same man, but who offer each other compliments and blessings, gifts and friendship (at one point Rowena asks Rebecca to stay in England, telling her that ""I will be a sister to you""). This is the first and only time that the two women interact during the course of the story, and it's a touching moment, one that ends the novel on the most perfect bittersweet note. Yet here Rowena is reduced to a jealous shrew who yells at Rebecca for seducing her husband, forcing Rebecca to lie to her about Ivanhoe's faithfulness to her during their exploits together. Of course, the very fact that in this version, Ivanhoe *does* in fact show romantic interest in Rebecca makes this lie a necessity (in the novel, his feelings are ambiguous at best, though his commitment to Rowena never wavers), but it's a damn shame that such a lovely scene of female understanding and solidarity was rewritten for the sake of melodrama. That Rowena is childish enough to need placating and Rebecca is willing to lie in order to give it to her is a grave disservice to both their characters.Still, despite a few missteps, it's an entertaining series, and a good companion piece to both the book and the prior adaptations.",4,"""Find Happiness in your Chosen Life...""",1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,7384,"['successfully',

I can say that this is a compelling, well-acted, and relatively historically faithful miniseries. All of the characters have depth and their fates are of interest to the viewer. This includes the tertiary characters and the villians.The basic story is about Lord Ivanhoe, who is wrongly accused of betraying the king, and what happens to him and those close to him as he struggles to prove his innocence of the crime he's accused of. His actions and fate are linked to those of his father, his childhood sweetheart, his servants, King Richard, and a Jewish father and daughter.The story is complex and moves along at a good pace. It is also gritty and violent at times so it's not for those who are keen on a highly polished knight epic with theatrical acting and lofty drama (a la the knight movies of the 50's). The suffering the characters have to endure is almost painful to watch at times.

422395,A10PC6OX6CEHZV,6304441657,Steve W.,"[0, 0]","I recently read the novel. A second time, but the first was when I very young.  I've seen the old Hollywood movie on cable several times over the years.  I like to search the internet for well regarded reviews of film adaptations of classic books.  I took a chance with the TV mini series featuring Olivia Hussey and James Mason.  I was generally disappointed with it.  So I ordered this A&E; double dvd version.  Probably owing to the fact that I had recently watched that other dvd, this second purchase seemed more agreeable to me.As others have described, the tone of production is harder, harsher, dirtier.  The inevitable changes in storyline from book to film are not too extreme.  At least that was my impression for the first half (first dvd of two).  The Ivanhoe character is clearly depicted as a fighter hero.  The Saxons are easily distinguished from the Normans as a culture.  And there are other examples that worked for my favor.On the other hand, there are some things I was looking for that did not get included.  There's a novel scene where the Black Knight imposes on the hermit monk.  It's a major story within the novel that introduces two characters that have endured in popular culture.  But it gets a short depiction in the film.  Later, in the book, the Black Knight literally beats the castle door to splinters (during the siege).  It establishes the relationship between him and the Saxons, particularly Cedric.  The film has a battering ram break open the doors.  So I felt there were some concepts missed.  But that's how it goes with films.  The writers didn't read what I read I guess.  The second half of the film seemed to diverge more from the novel, or maybe my tolerance was wearing by then.  Some changes were unnecessary.The novel itself has some breakdowns in characterization.  For example, Cedric the Saxon denies his son (whom he loves) because he loves a good woman.  But Scott really never sells it to the reader.  The actions of Brian de Bois depict him as the villain.  But later attempts by Scott to portray him as conflicted make him unbelievable.  He loves the Jewess Rebecca, but will have her burned at the stake.  It doesn't work in the book, and so script writers have to address it on their own.  The book is a pretty serious attack on anti-Semitism, and class prejudice.  But Scott describes the Jewish characters with stereotypes that make me wonder of his own prejudice.Still, I like the book well enough.  It's fun to read.  And I think this film version is acceptable to watch.  But I think there's still a better adaptation to be made some day.",3,a three star headline,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2605,"['recently', 'read', 'novel', 'second', 'time', 'first', 'was', 'when', 'very', 'young', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'cable', 'several', 'times', 'years', 'like', 'search', 'internet', 'well', 'regarded', 'reviews', 'film', 'adaptations', 'classic', 'books', 'took', 'chance', 'TV', 'mini', 'series', 'featuring', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'James', 'Mason', 'was', 'generally', 'disappointed', 'ordered', 'A', 'E', 'double', 'dvd', 'version', 'Probably', 'owing', 'fact', 'had', 'recently', 'watched', 'other', 'dvd', 'second', 'purchase', 'seemed', 'more', 'agreeable', 'me.As', 'others', 'have', 'described', 'tone', 'production', 'harder', 'dirtier', 'inevitable', 'changes', 'storyline', 'book', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'extreme', 'least', 'was', 'impression', 'first', 'half', 'first', 'dvd', 'two', 'Ivanhoe', 'character', 'clearly', 'depicted', 'fighter', 'hero', 'Saxons', 'are', 'easily', 'distinguished', 'Normans', 'culture', 'are', 'other', 'examples', 'worked', 'favor.On', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'things', 'was', 'looking', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'included', 'novel', 'scene', 'where', 'Black', 'Knight', 'hermit', 'monk', 'major', 'story', 'novel', 'two', 'characters', 'have', 'endured', 'popular', 'culture', 'short', 'depiction', 'film', 'Later', 'book', 'Black', 'Knight', 'literally', 'castle', 'door', 'splinters', 'siege', 'relationship', 'Saxons', 'particularly', 'Cedric', 'film', 'battering', 'ram', 'break', 'open', 'doors', 'So', 'felt', 'were', 'concepts', 'missed', 'how', 'films', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'what', 'read', 'guess', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'seemed', 'diverge', 'more', 'novel', 'maybe', 'tolerance', 'was', 'wearing', 'then', 'changes', 'were', 'unnecessary.The', 'novel', 'breakdowns', 'characterization', 'example', 'Cedric', 'Saxon', 'son', 'whom', 'good', 'woman', 'Scott', 'really', 'never', 'reader', 'actions', 'Brian', 'de', 'Bois', 'villain', 'later', 'attempts', 'Scott', 'portray', 'conflicted', 'make', 'unbelievable', 'Jewess', 'Rebecca', 'will', 'have', 'burned', 'stake', ""n't"", 'work', 'book', 'so', 'script', 'writers', 'have', 'address', 'own', 'book', 'pretty', 'serious', 'attack', 'anti-Semitism', 'class', 'prejudice', 'Scott', 'Jewish', 'characters', 'stereotypes', 'make', 'wonder', 'own', 'prejudice.Still', 'like', 'book', 'well', 'enough', 'fun', 'read', 'think', 'film', 'version', 'acceptable', 'watch', 'think', 'still', 'better', 'adaptation', 'be', 'made', 'day']",N/A
