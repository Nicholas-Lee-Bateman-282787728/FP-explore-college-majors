In one way, you are probably right, it is a kid's movie mainly in the fact that your kids will definetly enjoy it.  However, you might find that you enjoy it as well.The plot is a simple hero coming-of-age story.  What makes it interesting is that our protagonist is a third generation ""hero,"" but not only that, he's the son of the two most celebrated heroes.  Add into the mix the fact that he has not shown any ""hero"" powers, and you got a nice combination for this action-family flick, as our protagonist heads into SKY HIGH, the superhero school.Now, for the blu-ray transfer itself.  While I'm not a videophile, I was pleased with the quality and look of this encoding.  Disney apparently goes all out with their movies in regards to PQ, and it shows.  It also has a scene showcase, which plays all the scenes where the Hi-def content really pops out at you.There are a few extras, such as the ""making of the film"" like featurettes, and if I remember correctly, a commentary.All and all, I recommend this film for your kids, and even for yourself, if you were ever into comic books and the like.",4,A surprisingly enjoyable film,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,1168,"['first', 'glance', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'write', 'off', 'kid', 'movie', 'one', 'way', 'are', 'probably', 'right', 'kid', 'movie', 'mainly', 'fact', 'kids', 'will', 'definetly', 'enjoy', 'However', 'might', 'find', 'enjoy', 'well.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'hero', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'What', 'interesting', 'protagonist', 'third', 'generation', 'hero', 'not', 'only', 'that', 'son', 'two', 'most', 'celebrated', 'heroes', 'Add', 'mix', 'fact', 'not', 'shown', 'hero', 'powers', 'got', 'nice', 'combination', 'action-family', 'flick', 'protagonist', 'heads', 'SKY', 'HIGH', 'superhero', 'school.Now', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', ""'m"", 'not', 'videophile', 'was', 'pleased', 'quality', 'look', 'encoding', 'Disney', 'apparently', 'movies', 'regards', 'PQ', 'also', 'scene', 'showcase', 'scenes', 'where', 'Hi-def', 'content', 'really', 'out', 'you.There', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'such', 'making', 'film', 'featurettes', 'remember', 'correctly', 'commentary.All', 'recommend', 'film', 'kids', 'even', 'were', 'ever', 'comic', 'books', 'like']",N/A

I read the reviews for this movie and it sounded great.It started ok, but then it just got terrible! I should have turned it off but I thought that the &#34;sexy stuff&#34; and teen romance would lessen rather than become the focus.The first thing that really bothered me was that Kelly Preston's character, dressed in her super hero suit, had her breasts pushed up more than I thought possible and it was very noticeable and not the body image I want my kids thinking of. Then it got worse because the villain high school girl had the same thing going on with her homecoming dress.  Think Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.This movie makes being a teen look like it is all about kissing, betrayal, teen romance, bullying, and faking romance to make someone jealous.There is a part where the main character says &#34;Ew, I made out with an old lady!&#34; &#34;Made out&#34; is not a term I want my kids knowing or saying right now.Horrible movie! It's for 13 year olds but they wouldn't like it because it is meant for a younger audience. Basically not a good movie for anyone.I cannot believe the good reviews this movie gets.  A little romance is ok but it became the main focus.  We were thinking it would be more about kids being superheroes and having fun.  There is a part where two teachers go out on a double date and the two dumb blondes are all over one of the teachers, that is really not what I want my kids thinking adult dating looks like.We are not prudes but do try to keep our kids from being exposed to tween/teen issues.  I wish there were more movies that show kids having kid fun and doing great things that involve being smart and passionate about sensible things rather than teen passion, love triangles and being a bully or mean girl.",1,INAPPROPRIATE!

""Sky High"" has a clever script, an excellent cast of grown-ups (including Kurt Russell, Linda Carter, Bruce Campbell, and ""Kids in the Hall"" alums Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald), and a likeable (if not super-charismatic) ensemble of young actors and actresses.The only real drawbacks to this film are its lackluster special effects, many of which involve obvious models and amaturish-looking ""flying"" on wires. On the whole, they give ""Sky High"" a  low-budget, made-for-TV look, somewhat akin (in appearance only) to an episode of ""Power Rangers."" However, ""Sky High's"" sharp writing, solid performances, wit, charm, and uplifting message (i.e. it's not your super power that makes you a hero; it's what you do with it that counts) more than make up for Disney's apparent lack of financial backing.Highly recommended and appropriate for all ages.",4,"Clever and Entertaining, Despite Low-Tech FX",1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,1128,"['and/or', 'kids', 'are', 'fans', 'Incredibles', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'you/they', 'will', 'get', 'kick', 'Sky', 'High', 'too.This', 'one', 'best', 'family-friendly', 'action/comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'certainly', 'best', 'live-action', 'film', 'Disney', 'put', 'out', 'years', 'Sky', 'High', 'clever', 'script', 'excellent', 'cast', 'grown-ups', 'including', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Linda', 'Carter', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'alums', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'Kevin', 'McDonald', 'likeable', 'not', 'super-charismatic', 'ensemble', 'young', 'actors', 'only', 'real', 'drawbacks', 'film', 'are', 'lackluster', 'special', 'effects', 'many', 'involve', 'obvious', 'models', 'amaturish-looking', 'flying', 'wires', 'whole', 'give', 'Sky', 'High', 'low-budget', 'made-for-TV', 'look', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'appearance', 'only', 'episode', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'However', 'Sky', 'High', 'sharp', 'writing', 'solid', 'performances', 'wit', 'charm', 'uplifting', 'message', 'i.e', 'not', 'super', 'power', 'hero', 'what', 'do', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'Disney', 'apparent', 'lack', 'financial', 'backing.Highly', 'recommended', 'appropriate', 'ages']",N/A

943275,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000BJ7BCA,Bill Garrison,"[7, 8]","I rented Sky High for the kids and it turns out I was probably the one that liked it the most.  Sky High is the place where future super heroes go to school.  There, they learn how to be heroes (or side kicks) and go to classes like Mad Science and PE (save the civilian is a popular game).Will Stronghold is a typical kid trying to live down the fame of his two superhero parents.  Kurt Russell is great is the cocky dad who wants and expects his son to be a great super hero as well.  Kelly Preston is pretty but really doesn't have much to do.Will goes to school knowing he has yet to develop any superpowers.  Some of the best moments are when each kid has to display his powers and then be assigned to the hero or sidekick track.  Most adults will enjoy all of the super hero jokes.  The plot revolves around a typical high school movie plot of the boy falling for the popular girl and ignoring the girl who really likes him.The plot never gets too serious and instead plays for the jokes.  The cast was great, from the high school bad guy Warren Peace, the cute Lela (played by Danielle Panabaker sp?, sure to be a future star), Russell, and cameos by Bruce Cambell and Wonder Woman herself Linda Carter).Your kids will enjoy this movie and so will the parents.

His mother and father are superheroes who save the Earth from complete obliteration on a daily basis before dashing home to their ""normal"" jobs (real estate sales). Will's first day of school will be at Sky High, his father's alma-mater, a place where the offspring of other superheroes congregate and learn how to harness their powers. Trouble is, though, Will's powers haven't materialized (kind of like a set of wisdom teeth that haven't come in yet).His neighbor and lifelong friend, Layla, tells him not to worry about it, it'll happen. Easy for her to say, she can make trees grow and manipulate nature. Will hides his lack of powers from his parents and his new schoolmates. But not for long. On the freshman's first day, Coach Boomer (a gym teacher played by Bruce Campbell, BUBBA HO-TEP) is assigned to decide who becomes a superhero and who's a simple sidekick. And when Will can't do anything, he is flung into the dregs of the sidekicks. But he finds friends there, simple guys and gals who have limited powers. Some can only glow or turn into a puddle of goo, but they're all nice. And they cling to Will because of who his mother and father are (the two strongest superheroes of all time).Will's willingness to stick with his true friends will be tested as other forces and higher classmen shmooze for his attentionAnd what's a superhero without a super-villain. Enter an old villain that Will's dad defeated years ago and put him/her in Will's school and you've added a new layer to a freshman's problems.______________________________________________________________________________SKY HIGH is fun, cheeky, and clean family film viewing. There are lots of gags for adults and children alike and they're spread out fairly evenly throughout the movie, making the pacing and action smooth.There are also some great cameo appearances by super actresses and former superheroes. Linda Carter (WONDER WOMAN) plays Sky High's principal (a perfect role for her), and Cloris Leachman again appears as a wacky character: a school nurse with x-ray vision.Any issues I had with the movie were relegated to its extremely transparent plot and some cheesy dialogue (although I think some of that cheesiness was on purpose; a harkening back to the days of cheap TV sitcoms).The message of staying true to your friends (regardless of their stature at school) smacks the viewer in the face, but it's not a bad message for teens and preteens to see as they encounter the peer pressures of high school.This IS a fun film, no doubt about it. The relationships (be it father/son or girlfriend/boyfriend) are executed well and get the viewer into these superkids' lives in a pretty intimate way. The CGI is decent (not great, but good).

That is the premise for 2005's `Sky High', the live action family comedy from The Wonderful World of Disney.Will Stronghold is the son of the greatest Super Hero couple on the planet, the most anticipated new student at the secret super hero academy. The is only one small problem; Will has not developed any powers of his own, and has gone to great lengths to hide that fact from his well meaning, but ultimately egotistical father. If that weren't enough, Will also has to contend with living up to his father's reputation, falling in love, and meeting his very own arch enemy. What follows is an out of the ordinary mix of standard high school angst and comic book fantasy.Though the plot is a little thin and often predictable, the characters and tired clich&eacute;s of most high school comedies are played for new laughs as the students are divided into cliques of `Hero's' and `Sidekicks' (though they prefer the term `Hero Support').The cast of teen's is comprised of many fresh faces, but the supporting cast includes in varying degrees, Kurt Russell, Kelly Preston, Bruce Campbell (Evil Daed), Kevin McDonald (Kids In The Hall), Cloris Leachman (Young Frankenstein), and Linda Carter who still looks like she could jump into her invisible jet and save the day as Wonder Woman. Dave Foley (New Radio) steals nearly every seen he is in as the long suffering side kick, er, Hero Support `All American Boy' to Kurt Russell's  `Commander'.Most kid's under twelve will probably love this movie (my seven year old did), any kids older than that will probably find it a little too nice and cheerful.

943288,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000BJ7BCA,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","The Italian title ""Sculoa di superpoteri"" is particularly apt for this Disney live-action outing.  In a world where superheroes (and supervillains) are apparently even more ubiquitous than in the Marvel Universe--some are second-generation and raising kids who'll become the third--Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) is facing his first day at high school.  But because his parents are super--the incredibly strong Commander (Kurt Russell), whose father was also a hero, and Jetstream (Kelly Preston), who has the gift of flight--the high school he's entering isn't your garden-variety secondary.  Sky High (so named because it floats far above the surface of Earth on a gigantic anti-grav saucer) is specifically designed for the children of superheroes, some of whose parents (including the Commander) are alumni, and is intended not only to teach them the usual academic subjects but to prepare them for a life of super-service.  Some, including Will, haven't yet come into their powers; others, like his lifelong best friend Layla (Danielle Panabaker), another heroes'-child who has power over growing things, have; and some seem to be stuck halfway between, like white-blond Ethan (Dee Jay Daniels), who can glow in the dark, or to have powers nobody sensible would want, like Little Larry (Loren Berman), who can transform himself into a puddle of liquid and ooze just about anywhere he wants to go.  This quartet soon finds itself stuck in the ""sidekick"" track--until Will's power abruptly manifests during a disagreement with sullen Zach (Nicholas Braun) in the cafeteria.  Before he quite understands what's happening, he and his three friends find themselves faced with the prospect of saving the world (to say nothing of their own superparents) long before they're really ready for the task.  Yet for all its fantastic aspects, the movie has a lot to say about issues ordinary high-schoool kids must face: career choices, bullies, romance (and its conflicts with friendship), betrayal, cooperation, disappointment, parent trouble.  All of which makes it not only a fun and funny adventure but a story that will speak to youngsters--perhaps more subtly than the usual teen angst-fest, but all the more enjoyably.",4,"High school's never easy, even if you're super",1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,2222,"['Italian', 'title', 'Sculoa', 'di', 'superpoteri', 'particularly', 'apt', 'Disney', 'live-action', 'outing', 'world', 'where', 'superheroes', 'supervillains', 'are', 'apparently', 'even', 'more', 'ubiquitous', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'are', 'second-generation', 'raising', 'kids', 'who', ""'ll"", 'become', 'third', 'Will', 'Stronghold', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'facing', 'first', 'day', 'high', 'school', 'parents', 'are', 'super', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'Commander', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'father', 'was', 'also', 'hero', 'Jetstream', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'who', 'gift', 'flight', 'high', 'school', 'entering', ""n't"", 'garden-variety', 'secondary', 'Sky', 'High', 'so', 'named', 'far', 'surface', 'Earth', 'gigantic', 'anti-grav', 'saucer', 'specifically', 'designed', 'children', 'superheroes', 'parents', 'including', 'Commander', 'are', 'alumni', 'intended', 'not', 'only', 'teach', 'usual', 'academic', 'subjects', 'prepare', 'life', 'super-service', 'including', 'Will', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'come', 'powers', 'others', 'lifelong', 'best', 'friend', 'Layla', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', ""heroes'-child"", 'who', 'power', 'growing', 'things', 'have', 'seem', 'be', 'stuck', 'halfway', 'white-blond', 'Ethan', 'Dee', 'Jay', 'Daniels', 'who', 'can', 'glow', 'dark', 'have', 'powers', 'nobody', 'sensible', 'would', 'want', 'like', 'Little', 'Larry', 'Loren', 'Berman', 'who', 'can', 'transform', 'puddle', 'liquid', 'ooze', 'just', 'about', 'anywhere', 'go', 'quartet', 'soon', 'stuck', 'sidekick', 'track', 'Will', 'power', 'abruptly', 'disagreement', 'sullen', 'Zach', 'Nicholas', 'Braun', 'cafeteria', 'quite', 'what', 'happening', 'three', 'friends', 'find', 'faced', 'prospect', 'saving', 'world', 'say', 'nothing', 'own', 'superparents', 'long', ""'re"", 'really', 'ready', 'task', 'fantastic', 'aspects', 'movie', 'lot', 'say', 'issues', 'ordinary', 'high-schoool', 'kids', 'must', 'face', 'career', 'choices', 'bullies', 'romance', 'conflicts', 'friendship', 'betrayal', 'cooperation', 'disappointment', 'parent', 'trouble', 'not', 'only', 'fun', 'funny', 'adventure', 'story', 'will', 'speak', 'youngsters', 'perhaps', 'more', 'subtly', 'usual', 'teen', 'angst-fest', 'more', 'enjoyably']",N/A

To my amazement (and most everybody else's) I was wildly successful, if only for one year. Those opportunities did all they could and soon I was back at the bottom of the ladder. This was 10th grade for me, and now, 9 years later that one year still basks in an immaculate glow unchallenged by any other memories of mine. And this is despite the fact that today, at my advanced age, I know that the price of coolness is originality and freedom and basically your soul. I hated the person I was back then but I loved being him. That time in my life was so intoxicating I may never get over it. And that intoxication and its hazards are the subject of ""Sky High.""The story revolves around Will Stronghold, the son of two famous superheroes, as he is sent off to a new superhero school. After finally finding his superpowers and being anointed superhero (as opposed to sidekick), he leaves his true friends in the dust and being hanging with the other superheroes. This being a Disney movie we all know that along they way Will will recognize the errors of his ways and return to his roots, but along the way director Mike Mitchell delivers a very clever, very relevant look at modern high schools. My main complaint is that they give him superpowers at all. Why spend the first half of the film defending the idea of having no powers just so that he can go against them. I'm sure the idea is to give him excuse to get in with the popular kids, but didn't we just play that game with ""Mean Girls?"" It also gave the director an opportunity to show off some of his special effects fireworks. I really liked the way the film attacked the self-esteem drenched 90's. Sorry, not everybody can be a superhero, and I don't care what your second grade teacher told you. Some of us are sidekicks, and some of us are villains. One of the best scenes involves Will's dad complimenting him on actually hanging out with sidekicks, all the while condescending to them (""They've really lowered the bar at that school since my day.""). This swipe at all those parental types who have understated hatred for all things inferior (at least in their mind) is long overdue and refreshing (especially in the age of nepotism that we now live).There are a few other problems with this film, but they are mostly minor. To cast Dave Foley in such a pathetic role seemed a little cruel, especially considering the hard times his career has fallen on. The film also has a look that maybe it was made on the cheap. The special effects are there and used intelligently, but the production value overall seems to be sub-par. I also could have lived without the very obvious point they were going for that all forward females are not to be trusted and probably evil. I know Disney is not in the game of telling kids sex is good. But to tell a younger generation that anytime a girl shows special interest in you it's a bad thing just seems dishonest. Still the film is high quality and deserves to be seen, especially for anybody looking for a little fresh blood in the superhero genre. ***1/2",3,Even Superheroes want to be Popular,1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,3219,"['lifetime', 'being', 'punching', 'bag', 'schools', 'put', 'together', 'few', 'convenient', 'opportunities', 'made', 'run', 'top', 'school', 'popularity', 'charts', 'amazement', 'most', 'everybody', 'else', 'was', 'wildly', 'successful', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'opportunities', 'did', 'could', 'soon', 'was', 'back', 'bottom', 'ladder', 'was', '10th', 'grade', 'now', '9', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'year', 'still', 'immaculate', 'glow', 'unchallenged', 'other', 'memories', 'mine', 'fact', 'today', 'advanced', 'age', 'know', 'price', 'coolness', 'originality', 'freedom', 'basically', 'soul', 'hated', 'person', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'loved', 'being', 'time', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'intoxicating', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'intoxication', 'hazards', 'are', 'subject', 'Sky', 'High', 'story', 'around', 'Will', 'Stronghold', 'son', 'two', 'famous', 'superheroes', 'sent', 'off', 'new', 'superhero', 'school', 'finally', 'finding', 'superpowers', 'being', 'anointed', 'superhero', 'opposed', 'sidekick', 'true', 'friends', 'dust', 'being', 'hanging', 'other', 'superheroes', 'being', 'Disney', 'movie', 'know', 'way', 'Will', 'will', 'recognize', 'errors', 'ways', 'return', 'roots', 'way', 'director', 'Mike', 'Mitchell', 'very', 'clever', 'very', 'relevant', 'look', 'modern', 'high', 'schools', 'main', 'complaint', 'give', 'superpowers', 'Why', 'spend', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'defending', 'idea', 'having', 'powers', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'go', ""'m"", 'sure', 'idea', 'give', 'excuse', 'get', 'popular', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'play', 'game', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'also', 'gave', 'director', 'opportunity', 'show', 'off', 'special', 'effects', 'fireworks', 'really', 'liked', 'way', 'film', 'attacked', 'self-esteem', 'drenched', '90', 'Sorry', 'not', 'everybody', 'can', 'be', 'superhero', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'second', 'grade', 'teacher', 'told', 'are', 'sidekicks', 'are', 'villains', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'involves', 'Will', 'dad', 'complimenting', 'actually', 'hanging', 'out', 'sidekicks', 'while', 'condescending', ""'ve"", 'really', 'lowered', 'bar', 'school', 'day.', 'swipe', 'parental', 'types', 'who', 'have', 'understated', 'hatred', 'things', 'inferior', 'least', 'mind', 'long', 'overdue', 'refreshing', 'especially', 'age', 'nepotism', 'now', 'live', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'problems', 'film', 'are', 'mostly', 'minor', 'cast', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'such', 'pathetic', 'role', 'seemed', 'little', 'cruel', 'especially', 'considering', 'hard', 'times', 'career', 'fallen', 'film', 'also', 'look', 'maybe', 'was', 'made', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'there', 'used', 'intelligently', 'production', 'value', 'overall', 'be', 'sub-par', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'very', 'obvious', 'point', 'were', 'going', 'forward', 'females', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'probably', 'evil', 'know', 'Disney', 'not', 'game', 'telling', 'kids', 'sex', 'good', 'tell', 'younger', 'generation', 'girl', 'special', 'interest', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'dishonest', 'Still', 'film', 'high', 'quality', 'be', 'seen', 'especially', 'anybody', 'looking', 'little', 'fresh', 'blood', 'superhero', 'genre', '***1/2']",N/A

Sky High is the story of Will Stronghold, son of two legendary superheroes, The Commander and Jetstream.  Will can't admit to his parents that he is still waiting to find out what his powers will be--or if he'll have any at all.  But either way he's off to the school for fledgling superheroes and sidekicks, Sky High, to experience what freshman year is like for paranormals.The daily ins and outs of a world where superheroes exist and are taken for granted add a great deal of fun and humor to the movie (I especially loved the traffic update:  ""Evil struck the morning commute in the form of a giant robot downtown...drivers are advised to take alternate routes...""), as are the typical highs and lows of high school.  The incoming freshman are immediately divided into the ""hero track"" and the ""sidekick track"", with the sidekicks routinely looked down upon.  Will finds himself having to figure out how to tell his dad that he's a sidekick, and then later, when he is reclassified as a hero, trying to maintain his true friendships with the sidekick cabal while finding the hero group overwhelmingly superficial and not so nice.  There's a quasi-suspenseful subplot involving Will having to save his parents and the whole school, but that's not where the heart of this movie is--it's in the life lessons about being proud of who you are and your abilities (even if it's only being able to turn into a guinea pig or a puddle of goo) and that everyone has something to contribute.  Typical kid movie fare but done in a more than usually imaginative and fun way.  There were plenty of laugh out loud funny moments in the storyline, including some fun pokes at the superhero genre (Dave Foley was priceless as the former kid sidekick turned teacher, who yearns to get back in the game.)The kid actors do a decent job in the movie but the real pleasure for this older viewer were the smaller adult roles with some fun familiar faces--Kurt Russell as the proud dad, Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald (""Kids in the Hall"") stealing every scene they are in as teachers at Sky High, Bruce Campbell as the obnoxious gym teacher, and (swoon!)

This year's freshman class includes future defender of the world Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano).  He's the son of the world's greatest superheroes, Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston), he starts out with a natural archenemy in fellow student Warren Peace (Steven Strait), and everyone - from his classmates to Ron Wilson - Bus Driver (Kevin Hefferman) to Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell) expects great things of him.  There's just one problem: he has yet to develop any superpowers.  Dealing with the pressures of high school is bad enough without the added pressures of being a powerless sidekick in a family of the most super superheroes on Earth.Sky High is also a high school, which puts all sorts of pressure of its own on the young superhero.  There's a cultural divide between heroes and sidekicks, and some of those with the greatest powers use their special skills to bully others.  Will sort of straddles the fence initially, as his lack of powers put him in the sidekick curriculum.  When his power finally manifests itself, he moves over to the hero class - and that's where his troubles really begin.  He tries to maintain his relationship with his sidekick friends, including best friend Layla, but the increasing attention of senior class president Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) really go to his head.  Like many a young person, Will is sort of stupid.  Layla (Danielle Panabaker) is a total babe who just so happens to be crazy about him, but he lets this pretty senior totally turn his head without stopping to wonder why the senior class's most desirable female is putting the moves on a freshman.I don't need to tell you how the story develops, as it's all pretty predictable stuff - but I must say it is exceedingly entertaining, as well.  This is a film that kids will love, teens will be able to identify with, and most adults will find very entertaining.  The laughs are plentiful, the special effects are right on the money, and the emotional aspects of this coming of age story play extremely well.  All of the principals may be superheroes or sidekicks, but they are also very human characters with many of the same problems we all share.  I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish.

943302,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B000BJ7BCA,Duane Thomas,"[1, 2]","There are a lot of a stories within the super-hero genre about the teen who suddenly comes into their power (the classic example being Spider-Man). That's because, if properly handled, it's a potent idea with huge potential for both angst and humor. In Sky High it's well-handled.Will Stronghold is the son of the world's two greatest super-heroes, the Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). With a father who's the strongest man on Earth and a mother who can fly at supersonic speeds, great things are expected of Will Stronghold as he lives up to their super-heroic legacy. Problem: at age 14, Will has no super-powers. Maybe he's a late bloomer, maybe he'll never get them.Will manages to hide this fact until his first day at Sky High, a super-hero prep school. There kids are immediately sorted into two groups, which are very much the ""haves"" and ""have nots"": those with impressive super-powers are Heroes, all others becomes Sidekicks, or, as they like to call themselves, Hero Support.Will finds himself very much one of the outs, his friends a boy whose only super-power is he can glow - dimly, a girl shapeshifter whose only alternate shape is a guinea pig, another boy whose power is melting into a puddle of oil, and Will's best friend since first grade, Layla, who actually has a really cool super-power of her own but lands in the Sidekicks simply because, thinking the entire concept of breaking people down into groups is stupid, she refuses to show anyone but Will her power. And then there's Warren Peace aka Hothead, the pyro-kinetic son of a bad guy sent away for life by the Commander. Let's just say that Hothead, when he finally meets Will, has a few issues to work out.On the other side of the good guy/bad guy Sky High equation we have Lash, a teen jerk Plastic Man; the super-fast bully Speed; the duplicate girl Penny (who is apparently too dim to even come up with a code name - personally, given her personality, I think Bad Penny would be perfect); and a mysterious hooded figure intent on somehow using Will and Sky High in a plot against the Commander and Jetstream.For all that this is a Disney comedy, it's rarely laugh-out-loud funny. (That's not a complaint, I like that things are played mostly straight.) The exception is Kurt Russell as the Commander. Russell has had such success as a dramatic actor, a lot of people forget he made his mark in Disney comedies, and he's actually a fine comedian with a flair for over-the-top goofiness. The Commander comes across as a bit pompous, not quite the sharpest tool in the shed, but under it all a doting dad who loves his son with all his heart. His scenes with Will are not only funny but genuinely touching. Steve Stronghold is not only the world's most powerful man, he just may be the world's best dad.The supporting cast in this movie is first rate, especially Bruce Campbell as gym coach Boomer, aka former second rate hero Sonic Boom, and Sky High principal Lynda Carter (who for my money looks even better now that she did 30 years ago as Wonder Woman).Sky High is like Buffy in that it uses an exaggerated reality (the supernatural, superheroics) as a venue to examine real human problems with which people, especially adolescents, can relate. While Sky High seems on the surface to be a bright, bouncy story of teen super-heroes, it's really about fearing you'll never meet your parents' expectations, of wanting to be part of the in-crowd so badly you turn your back on your friends, of living down bad parents, of falling in love with a friend who doesn't fall back, and more. Okay, it comes apart a bit at the end. As the hooded bad guy's plan is finally revealed, the straight approach goes away and things go over the line into camp. Still, Sky High is well worth watching.

943303,A2S1JQWKZMGFD2,B000BJ7BCA,"Durling Heath ""Durling Heath""","[6, 6]","It is always a struggle to find a movie at the video store for ""family movie night"" that both of my elementary school daughters will enjoy and I will, if not enjoy, be able to tolerate.  I have certainly appreciated the effort that many studios have made to make kids' films more enjoyable for parents.  When my younger daughter chose ""Sky High,"" I was not terribly optimistic, but Disney actually did a pretty good job making it sort of fun for this GenXer.  More importantly, the younger crowd LOVED it.Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano), the son of two superheroes, Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston), is about to start high school.  Will is not going to just any high school.  As the son of superheroes, he will go to Sky High, where he will follow in is parent's footsteps.  However, Will has a secret.  He does not have any super powers, so he is relegated to classes for ""Sidekick's,"" and that is obviously a disappointment to his famous father.  At Sky High, Will must deal with everything a ""normal"" kid must face while growing up, but, through a series of typically teen-age blunders, discovers he must also face his parents' greatest nemesis, Royal Pain (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).  The future of Sky High and of the entire world depends on Will.Disney used a lot of great tricks to transcend the generational gap in ""Sky High.""  For GenY, some of the costumes, acting, and special effects were very much reminiscent of the wildly popular, live-action, Saturday morning television show, ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.""  What boy born after 1978 was not secretly in love with the Pink Power Ranger portrayed by Amy Jo Johnson?  (Confession: When my little sister watched ""Power Rangers"" a couple of decades ago, I was sort of into the Pink Power Ranger myself!)  Royal Pain's costume, body movements, secret hideout, and general evil demeanor are a dead-ringer for ""Power Rangers"" genre.  For Gen X, a wonderful little trick that I had not seen before, although I have to imagine it has already been employed, is the use of classic, coming-of-age anthems, like, among others, ""I Melt The World,"" ""Save It For Later,"" ""Voices Carry,"" ""Everybody Wants To Rule The World,"" ""And She Was,"" but had them recorded by contemporary artists.  Heck, I think the entire soundtrack is comprised of `80's remakes.  (I still think The Talking Heads' version of ""And She Was"" is superior to that of Keaton Simons, but what would a six-year old care?)  For both Baby Boomers and some early GenXers, the casting of Kurt Russell is sort of an interesting bookend to Russell's Disney career.  I remember going with my parents to local single screen cinema to see Disney's ""The Computer Who Wore Tennis Shoes"" and ""The World's Strongest Man"" with Kurt Russell playing the teen-age lead.  Appearances by the original television ""Superwoman,"" Linda Carter, as well as ""Kids in the Hall,"" Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald go a long way to make ""Sky High"" ironically humorous for the adult audience.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I've got love for any film that'll showcase Spandau Ballet, and SKY HIGH is pretty generous in showcasing one of my childhood anthems, ""True."" Besides, SKY HIGH is worth many repeat viewings. As I recall, this offering from Walt Disney Pictures demonstrated strong legs at the box office. And why not? It is hugely entertaining. For Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano), peer pressure is a mother and he's not at all looking forward to this year's first day of school. Will Stronghold is the third generation child of a family of superheroes. His parents are Steve (Kurt Russell) and Josie (Kelly Preston), successful real estate brokers... who also happen to be the world's greatest caped crusaders, the invincible Commander and Jetstream, mistress of super-sonic flight and unarmed combat. Will is enrolled in Sky High, a hi-tech learning establishment ideal for molding tomorrow's super-powered crime fighters. Sky HIgh is his parents' alma mater. So expectations are off the charts.Will isn't about to tell his parents that he doesn't have any superpowers, that he's either a late bloomer or maybe even a never-was.Sky High is ""kept aloft by the latest in anti-gravitional propulsion,"" meaning that this unusual academy is accessed by a rocket-propelled school bus. The students all have some sort of special ability but, other than that, Sky High is like any other school. There are cliques and social politics and acne and teen angst and awkwardness. Will Stronghold's first day is pretty sad, especially when the ""power placement"" session - which determines whether you're a ""hero"" or a ""sidekick"" - swings around and Will arrives at the moment he'd been dreading, exhibiting his lack of powers. A dumbfounded Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell, more abrasive than the Sorting Hat) promptly labels him a sidekick and designates him to Hero Support, a course taught by the now middle-aged All-American Boy, who used to be the Commander's sidekick. Mr. Boy is terrifically played by Dave Foley.Michael Angarano doesn't at all look like a teenaged pin-up model, and this lends an immediate appeal and a realness to his role. You like him even when he pulls those bonehead slip-ups. In Hero Support, Will ends up hanging out with a shabby bunch of sidekicks so dubiously powered even the Legion of Substitute Heroes bully them for lunch money. There's a guy who glows (a hilarious Nicholas Braun). Another guy who melts into a puddle. A girl who shapeshifts into a guinea pig. The only one with serious powers is Will's best friend, Layla, who can manipulate plant life. Except that Layla, deeming the hero-sidekick system to be unfair, refused to demonstrate her talent. Ergo, sidekick.What's school without an unattainable crush? Will quickly falls for Sky High's most popular girl (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He also gets the stink eye from another freshman, the incendiary Warren Peace (Steven Strait), son of a hero and a super-villain (except that this super-villain parent used to be one of the Commander's foes).There are clever bits and, thankfully, not too many contrived bits. I love the scenes in the Hero Support class. The big bad's true nature caught me by surprise. Tonally, SKY HIGH tilts towards the lighthearted. Even the superhero action sequences are laden with humor, although that doesn't take away from the spectacle of the fighty fights. Thru character development and a solid script, the story allows you to get to know these lovable underdogs. Another strength of the film is that the cast - consisting of teens and established actors - performs seamlessly as a whole. The school faculty is peppered with iconic figures. Cloris Leachman cameos as the X-ray powered school nurse. And, most awesomely, Lynda Carter plays Sky High's Principal Powers. And she is still gorgeous. Meanwhile, Kurt Russell, with this movie (his 11th big screen Disney release), takes over Dean Jones' longstanding spot as Disney's most featured live-action male lead. It makes you realize that Kurt Russell grew up in front of our eyes. I just watched THE COMPUTER WORE TENNIS SHOES a few weeks ago, and I can't help but think that, forty years ago, Kurt Russell would've been playing the Will Stronghold role, instead of the beaming dad. Correction, ""beaming"" dad until the Commander learns that his son's a sidekick. Who hears Spandau Ballet music. Still, it's another element to relish in this film, the father-son relationship between the Commander and Will Stronghold.The DVD's extras:- Alternate Opening - a flashback sequence set in 1985

We see their flaws and troubles, and it helps the viewer relate a little more to the world we see on the screen.We've even seen pop groups tap into this, if you haven't heard the song by Five for Fighting called ""Superman"" with the catch line ""it's not easy to be me"" you need to hear it!I really enjoyed this movie.  The struggle between the ""heros"" and ""the sidekicks"" is strangely familiar, and the expectations  the super hero parents have for their children is also true to this life.Teenagers will like this, as will children and parents.

Here, they study to be either a) superheroes or b) sidekicks (aka Hero Support).  As with any high school, there are social cliques, raging hormones, and impossible homework, but SKY HIGH takes it all to a whole new level.It is the first day of high school at SKY HIGH for freshman Will Stronghold, son of superhero power couple The Commander and Jetstream.  Unfortunately for Will, he is a bit delayed and has not yet developed his powers.  He washes out at ""power classification"" and is shunted off to the sidekick track.  To make matters worse, he learns that, in very rare cases, the offspring of two superheroes may never develop powers.  Will makes the best of his situation, but is very worried about disappointing his top of the heap parents.  And of course, there is evil lurking about, and it seems to be targeting Will's family.  Will Will get his powers in time?  Will he get them at all?  Will he be able to save his family and the world?  Tune in to SKY HIGH to find out.Is SKY HIGH predictable, campy, and clich&eacute;?  YES!  Did I know exactly what was going to happen from the very beginning?  YES!  Was it immediately obvious who the real heroes and who the villains were?  YES!  Did I care? NO! NO! NO!  SKY HIGH is cute, sweet, and perfect for families.  There is no bad language, no sexual innuendo, no gore, and nothing more than mild comic book violence.  Just plain, good, clean fun.  I, personally, found myself grinning throughout most of this film, enjoying the sheer cuteness of it.The entire cast does a nice, campy, over the top job of it (hey, they ARE superheroes and super villains, after all), but I especially enjoyed the appearances of Lynda Carter, Cloris Leachman, and Bruce Campbell.  The story is typical Disney, with a happy ending and good messages.

943329,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000BJ7BCA,Kevin J. Loria,"[2, 3]","The popularity of the ""superpower school genre"" is at an all-time high with post-pubescent, pre-cape, Superman in Smallville and the Harry Potter franchise entering into the high school years, not to mention the success of Prof. Xaiver's school of mutants. Spidey is in collage now, but lets not forget his super-power secondary school antics or Dash Parr's elementary school track records. So naturally the time was right for a film that is part ""Breakfast Club"" and part ""Fantastic Four."" Sky High is the predictable coming-of-age spoof with a superhero shtick. Will Stronghold, the protagonist teen, and the son of two of Earth's greatest heroes (played terrifically by Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston) has a lot to live-up to, but no powers to speak of (at first). Adding to his natural teen anxieties Will is surrounded by ""gifted"" teens and intense teachers including Bruce Campbell, Lynda Carter, and Cloris Leachman. Ex-""Kids-in the-Hall"" Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald, best known in Disney circles as the voice of Pleakley in the Stitch series, are terrific together as Mr. Boy and Mr. Medulla.  The film has some twisted, yet familiar takes on high school hierarchies, archetypes and academic labels, the first is introduced though the superhero power placement test, which gives a whole new meaning to standardized testing not to mention the obligatory embarrassing gym activities. This classifies the students as ""Hero"" or ""Sidekick.""Effects are important in the superhero genre, even the super-sub genres.The visuals are just the right balance of comic book realism, some key moments being the transformation of the mild-mannered school bus into the supersonic Sky High Bus and the ""Save the Citizen"" homage to the X-Men's Danger Room is great fun.The soundtrack is the perfect clue to the `80's high school spoof with tunes you might misremember hearing in ""Sixteen Candles""  but, it definitely adds the right flavor. Young pop groups and Grammy nominated bands perform covers of classic teen film tunes, like Bowling for Soup's appropriate inclusion ""Melt with You,""  Vitamin C's remake of ""Voice Carry""  or Steven Straight with ""One Thing Leads to Another"" and more (checkout CD).Overall, super-family fun for the whole family, but may disappoint hardcore comic fans in it pedestrian handling of the material, especially on the heels of similarly themed projects like ""The Incredibles.""",4,FASTER THAN a speeding PROM!!!,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,2401,"['popularity', 'superpower', 'school', 'genre', 'all-time', 'high', 'post-pubescent', 'pre-cape', 'Superman', 'Smallville', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'entering', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'not', 'mention', 'success', 'Prof.', 'Xaiver', 'school', 'mutants', 'Spidey', 'collage', 'now', 'not', 'forget', 'super-power', 'secondary', 'school', 'antics', 'Dash', 'Parr', 'elementary', 'school', 'track', 'records', 'So', 'naturally', 'time', 'was', 'right', 'film', 'part', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'part', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Sky', 'High', 'predictable', 'coming-of-age', 'spoof', 'superhero', 'shtick', 'Will', 'Stronghold', 'protagonist', 'teen', 'son', 'two', 'Earth', 'greatest', 'heroes', 'played', 'terrifically', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'lot', 'live-up', 'powers', 'speak', 'first', 'Adding', 'natural', 'teen', 'anxieties', 'Will', 'surrounded', 'gifted', 'teens', 'intense', 'teachers', 'including', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Ex-', 'Kids-in', 'the-Hall', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'Kevin', 'McDonald', 'best', 'known', 'Disney', 'circles', 'voice', 'Pleakley', 'Stitch', 'series', 'are', 'terrific', 'together', 'Mr', 'Boy', 'Mr.', 'Medulla', 'film', 'twisted', 'yet', 'familiar', 'high', 'school', 'hierarchies', 'archetypes', 'academic', 'labels', 'first', 'introduced', 'superhero', 'power', 'placement', 'test', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'standardized', 'testing', 'not', 'mention', 'obligatory', 'embarrassing', 'gym', 'activities', 'students', 'Hero', 'Sidekick', 'Effects', 'are', 'important', 'superhero', 'genre', 'even', 'super-sub', 'genres.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'comic', 'book', 'realism', 'key', 'moments', 'being', 'transformation', 'mild-mannered', 'school', 'bus', 'supersonic', 'Sky', 'High', 'Bus', 'Save', 'Citizen', 'homage', 'X-Men', 'Danger', 'Room', 'great', 'fun.The', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'clue', '80', 'high', 'school', 'spoof', 'tunes', 'might', 'misremember', 'hearing', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'definitely', 'right', 'flavor', 'Young', 'pop', 'groups', 'Grammy', 'nominated', 'bands', 'perform', 'covers', 'classic', 'teen', 'film', 'tunes', 'Bowling', 'Soup', 'appropriate', 'inclusion', 'Melt', 'Vitamin', 'C', 'remake', 'Voice', 'Carry', 'Steven', 'Straight', 'One', 'Thing', 'more', 'CD', '.Overall', 'super-family', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'may', 'disappoint', 'hardcore', 'comic', 'fans', 'pedestrian', 'handling', 'material', 'especially', 'heels', 'similarly', 'themed', 'projects', 'Incredibles']",N/A

943331,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B000BJ7BCA,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[0, 1]","PLOT DETAILS FOLLOWWill Stronghold (Michael Angarano) is the son of the world's two most famous superheroes, The Commander aka Steve Stronghold (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream aka Josie Stronghold (Kelly Preston). In a world where superheroes are an everyday part of life, their children attend Sky High, a private secondary school built on an anti-gravity platform far above the surface of the Earth, accessible only by a flying school bus piloted/diiven by Kevin Heffernan (THE KING OF QUEENS) and run by Principal Powers (Lynda Carter of WONDER WOMAN).As part of the first day Freshman rituals, the new students are expected to demonstrate their super powers in front of the rest of the class. Graded by Coach Boomer, the retired superhero Sonic Boom, students are either classified as Heroes or Sidekicks; it is the Sidekicks who become the pariahs in the pecking order due to their weak or offbeat, or impractical powers (one boy glows bright yellow, one girl can shapeshift only into a guinea pig, Will's best friend, Layla (Danielle Panabaker) refuses to demonstrate her powers for ethical reasons, and Will shows no sign of super powers at all).Fortunately for Will, the prettiest and most popular girl in school, Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), takes a shine to him. A Technopath, she can build anything out of anything, and helps him in Chemistry Class and with such projects as his ray gun. Will is soon smitten with her. Because of this ""in"" with the In Crowd, Will's confidence soars, and he soon begins to develop Super Strength and the ability to fly. Transferred from the  Sidekick classes to the Hero classes, Will starts ignoring his friends, particularly the secretly-in-love-with-him Layla, who is heartbroken.To needle Will, she begins hanging out with Warren Peace, the son of a mixed marriage (Mom's a Superhero, Dad's a Supervillain put in jail by Will's parents); Warren himself is a dour Gothic kid who can shoot fireballs from the palms of his hands.Holy Pep Rally! It soon turns out that Gwen is not quite so nice as she seems. The Prom becomes a revenge fest, in which Will and Warren, backed by the Sidekicks, on one side, and Gwen (aka Major Pain) engage in a titanic battle between Good and Evil. The ending is a foregone conclusion in a movie like this, but let's face it, he couldn't have done it without them.Looking at it coldly, SKY HIGH should have been a bomb, but it isn't, successfully blending the usual acne-angst elements of a Teen Movie (including the obligatory housewrecking party), with one-off Comic Book Characters. The result is light and entertaining, and rarely misses a beat.Kurt Russell is wonderfully goofy as Dad Stronghold, both battling evil and sneaking Will down into the Secret Sanctum for a game of pinball---""Don't tell your mother, she's still mad at me for dropping that battleship on her foot"" kind of dialogue is his stock-in-trade; as Mom, Kelly Preston gets just not enough time in her skintight Jetstream outfit to be truly satisfying on camera in her smallish role; Angarano is just teenage dorky enough as Will, but not so dorky that his transformation is unbelievable; Mary Elizabeth Winstead is just the sweetest thing in a skirt until she isn't anymore.Danielle Pannabaker is the great surprise in SKY HIGH. Alternately shy and retiring, and calm and full of certitude, she imbues Layla with a kind of dignity none of the other characters have. When she finally uses her powers, they are entirely in character for her and yet unusual, a true expression of Female Power at its best.A THREE-AND-A-HALF-STAR effort, SKY HIGH is good family fun fare.",4,"""What do you want me to do?

943332,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BJ7BCA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","One of the interesting aspects of the original X-Men were that they were also students at Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, where the teenagers were learning to become superheroes.  When the X-Men grew up and went international they got away from the whole school idea become irrelevant even with the arrival of Kitty Pryde.  But then Marvel came up with ""The New Mutants,"" which got back to the idea of teenagers learning to deal with their powers and with being teenagers.  The school aspect has been played up more in the ""X-Men"" movies, but it is still a secondary consideration to what the grownups are doing, which is why ""Sky High"" has its inherent appeal.Granted, the superhero world of ""Sky High"" is more akin to that found on Saturday morning cartoons than Marvel comic books, but that is because the idea is to keep thing fun while trying to slip in the lesson.  Our young hero here is Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano), the off spring of the most famous superheroes in the world, the Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston).  The Commander is certainly a little bit full of himself, but without in danger of becoming obnoxious and while being over the top is central to the performances in these films Russell and the other adults only go about as far as their eyes in doing so.  That way the kids get to keep things real.The key scene in the film for me is when Layla (Danielle Panabaker, who they should get to play a young Bree in any ""Desperate Housewives"" flashbacks), the girl next door who is Will's best friend but wants to be more, has a talk with Will's arch enemy, Warren Peace (Steven Strait) at a Chinese restaurant about the upcoming Homecoming Dance.  This is a scene we have seen before being played by kids with superpowers (she controls flora, he plays with fire), but it is played with a refreshing honesty and makes it clear these are real kids and not just cartoon superheroes.Will and Layla are now freshmen at Sky High, the alma mater of his parents.  Because Will's parents are the Commander and Jetstream he is considered to be a BMOC but there is one problem: his powers have not come in yet.  That means when the incoming class is separated into heroes and sidekicks by Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell), Will ends up being one of the latter.  So does Layla, but that is because she refuses to use her powers to buy into the existing power structure.  This is not good, because he is supposed to be a third-generation superhero and telling his dad he is just a sidekick is a fate worse than death.The division into heroes and sidekicks means that Sky High ends up being just like any other high school with its cliques as the future heroes treat their future sidekicks like something less than support staff (sidekicks do not get names or costumes until they are assigned such by their heroes at graduation).  Will makes friends with the other sidekicks, all of whom have superpowers, just unimpressive ones (e.g., glowing, turning into a guinea pig).  But just as the lines are drawn between ""us"" and ""them,"" Will's powers kick in and he switches sides.  Suddenly he is hanging with the heroes and he has caught the attention of sexy senior Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).  Meanwhile, Royal Pain, one of the Commander's old super villains, has set his eyes on the kids at Sky High.Now, you should know exactly how this is going to play out, but that does not stop you from enjoying the proceedings.  All of those minor superpowers enjoyed by Will's sidekick friends are going to be the powers needed at the right time and the right place.  The screenplay was written by Paul Hernandez, Robert Schooley & Mark McCorkle, and whoever wrote the last line of the film go the final punch line right.  The result is not great satire but certainly a lot of fun, including waiting around for Lynda Carter's Principal Powers to make the inevitable in-joke.  This is really a cute movie, which is certainly not a bad thing in this case.",4,High school can be rough even if you have superpowers,1133395200,"12 1, 2005",2005,3992,"['One', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'original', 'X-Men', 'were', 'were', 'also', 'students', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'School', 'Gifted', 'Youngsters', 'where', 'teenagers', 'were', 'learning', 'become', 'superheroes', 'When', 'X-Men', 'grew', 'up', 'went', 'international', 'got', 'away', 'whole', 'school', 'idea', 'become', 'irrelevant', 'even', 'arrival', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'then', 'Marvel', 'came', 'up', 'New', 'Mutants', 'got', 'back', 'idea', 'teenagers', 'learning', 'deal', 'powers', 'being', 'teenagers', 'school', 'aspect', 'been', 'played', 'up', 'more', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'still', 'secondary', 'consideration', 'what', 'grownups', 'are', 'doing', 'why', 'Sky', 'High', 'inherent', 'appeal.Granted', 'superhero', 'world', 'Sky', 'High', 'more', 'akin', 'found', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'books', 'idea', 'keep', 'thing', 'fun', 'trying', 'slip', 'lesson', 'young', 'hero', 'here', 'Will', 'Stronghold', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'off', 'spring', 'most', 'famous', 'superheroes', 'world', 'Commander', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Jetstream', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Commander', 'certainly', 'little', 'bit', 'full', 'danger', 'becoming', 'obnoxious', 'being', 'top', 'central', 'performances', 'films', 'Russell', 'other', 'adults', 'only', 'go', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'eyes', 'doing', 'so', 'way', 'kids', 'get', 'keep', 'things', 'real.The', 'key', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Layla', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'who', 'should', 'get', 'play', 'young', 'Bree', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'flashbacks', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'Will', 'best', 'friend', 'be', 'more', 'talk', 'Will', 'arch', 'enemy', 'Warren', 'Peace', 'Steven', 'Strait', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'upcoming', 'Homecoming', 'Dance', 'scene', 'have', 'seen', 'being', 'played', 'kids', 'superpowers', 'flora', 'fire', 'played', 'refreshing', 'honesty', 'clear', 'are', 'real', 'kids', 'not', 'just', 'cartoon', 'superheroes.Will', 'Layla', 'are', 'now', 'freshmen', 'Sky', 'High', 'alma', 'mater', 'parents', 'Will', 'parents', 'are', 'Commander', 'Jetstream', 'considered', 'be', 'BMOC', 'one', 'problem', 'powers', 'have', 'not', 'come', 'yet', 'when', 'incoming', 'class', 'separated', 'heroes', 'sidekicks', 'Coach', 'Boomer', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Will', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'latter', 'So', 'Layla', 'use', 'powers', 'buy', 'existing', 'power', 'structure', 'not', 'good', 'supposed', 'be', 'third-generation', 'superhero', 'telling', 'dad', 'just', 'sidekick', 'fate', 'worse', 'death.The', 'division', 'heroes', 'sidekicks', 'Sky', 'High', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'other', 'high', 'school', 'cliques', 'future', 'treat', 'future', 'sidekicks', 'something', 'less', 'support', 'staff', 'sidekicks', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'names', 'costumes', 'are', 'assigned', 'such', 'heroes', 'graduation', 'Will', 'friends', 'other', 'sidekicks', 'whom', 'have', 'superpowers', 'just', 'unimpressive', 'ones', 'e.g.', 'glowing', 'turning', 'guinea', 'pig', 'just', 'lines', 'are', 'drawn', 'Will', 'powers', 'kick', 'sides', 'Suddenly', 'hanging', 'heroes', 'caught', 'attention', 'sexy', 'senior', 'Gwen', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Meanwhile', 'Royal', 'Pain', 'one', 'Commander', 'old', 'super', 'villains', 'set', 'eyes', 'kids', 'Sky', 'High.Now', 'should', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'not', 'stop', 'enjoying', 'proceedings', 'minor', 'superpowers', 'enjoyed', 'Will', 'sidekick', 'friends', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'powers', 'needed', 'right', 'time', 'right', 'place', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Paul', 'Hernandez', 'Robert', 'Schooley', 'Mark', 'McCorkle', 'wrote', 'last', 'line', 'film', 'go', 'final', 'punch', 'line', 'right', 'result', 'not', 'great', 'satire', 'certainly', 'lot', 'fun', 'including', 'waiting', 'around', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'Principal', 'Powers', 'make', 'inevitable', 'in-joke', 'really', 'cute', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'case']",N/A

He's attending his parent's alma mater, and the pressure to live up to their legacy is huge.  See, his parents (Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston) happen to be the biggest superheroes known to mankind.  As The Commander and Jetstream, they routinely work together to save the world.  But Will has a big problem; he has no super powers of his own.Will is quickly put in the Sidekick's class, a huge dishonor he tries to keep from his parents.  Even so, he quickly makes friends and begins to settle in, even attracting the attention of the beautiful student body president, something unheard of for a freshman in the Sidekick class, or Hero Support if you prefer.Danger lurks around every corner, however.  Will has an arch nemesis on campus and someone is watching the Stronghold's secret lair.  Will Will develop any powers to help cope with these problems?This movie is supposed to be mindless fun for the young and young at heart, and it succeeds mightily.  All the actors do a great job, especially the mostly unknown teen cast.  The adults in the film have fun with their rolls.  Everyone's trying to do a good job but have fun at the same time, and that spirit draws you into the film.  I especially enjoyed Lynda Carter's brief appearances as the school principal, and she gets the best line out of the entire movie.The plot, on the other hand, is fairly predictable for anyone who has seen a Disney family film before.  I had most everything figured out before it happened, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie for one minute.  Being a high school movie, it has many cliches from that genre as well, but with a clever superhero twist.  The special effects are decent and help draw you into the film.The DVD is nothing special, but it gets the job done.  The wide screen picture and full surround sound are great.  Extras include a music video (Bowling for Soup with ""I Melt with You""), bloopers, behind the scenes, stunts, and an alternate opening.  Of these, the only one really worth watching is the alternate opening.  It's fun and helps fill in a couple plot points from the movie better.This is the perfect movie to watch with the family or after a long week when you just want to relax.  It takes itself just seriously enough to be fun but not so seriously that it becomes overly cheesy.",5,If Only High School Were Really This Super,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,2393,"['Will', 'Stronghold', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'start', 'first', 'day', 'high', 'school', 'attending', 'parent', 'alma', 'mater', 'pressure', 'live', 'up', 'legacy', 'huge', 'See', 'parents', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'happen', 'be', 'biggest', 'superheroes', 'known', 'mankind', 'Commander', 'Jetstream', 'routinely', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'world', 'Will', 'big', 'problem', 'super', 'powers', 'own.Will', 'quickly', 'put', 'Sidekick', 'class', 'huge', 'dishonor', 'keep', 'parents', 'Even', 'so', 'quickly', 'friends', 'settle', 'even', 'attracting', 'attention', 'beautiful', 'student', 'body', 'president', 'something', 'unheard', 'freshman', 'Sidekick', 'class', 'Hero', 'Support', 'prefer.Danger', 'lurks', 'corner', 'however', 'Will', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'campus', 'someone', 'watching', 'Stronghold', 'secret', 'lair', 'Will', 'Will', 'develop', 'powers', 'help', 'cope', 'problems', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'mindless', 'fun', 'young', 'young', 'heart', 'mightily', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'especially', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'teen', 'cast', 'adults', 'film', 'have', 'fun', 'rolls', 'Everyone', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'have', 'fun', 'same', 'time', 'spirit', 'draws', 'film', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'brief', 'appearances', 'school', 'principal', 'best', 'line', 'entire', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'other', 'hand', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Disney', 'family', 'film', 'had', 'most', 'everything', 'figured', 'out', 'happened', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'one', 'minute', 'Being', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'many', 'cliches', 'genre', 'as', 'well', 'clever', 'superhero', 'twist', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'decent', 'help', 'draw', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'special', 'job', 'done', 'wide', 'screen', 'picture', 'full', 'surround', 'sound', 'are', 'great', 'Extras', 'include', 'music', 'video', 'Bowling', 'Soup', 'Melt', 'bloopers', 'scenes', 'stunts', 'alternate', 'opening', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'alternate', 'opening', 'fun', 'fill', 'couple', 'plot', 'points', 'movie', 'better.This', 'perfect', 'movie', 'watch', 'family', 'long', 'week', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'relax', 'just', 'seriously', 'enough', 'be', 'fun', 'not', 'so', 'seriously', 'overly', 'cheesy']",N/A

943343,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000BJ7BCA,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[0, 0]","The 2005 superhero family fantasy ""Sky High"" is about a boy named Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) whose parents, Steve & Josie Stronghold (Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston respectively), are famous superheroes named ""The Commander"" and ""Jetstream"".  Steve (""The Commander"") has super-strength and Josie (""Jetstream"") can fly.  Naturally, Steve & Josie believe that their son Will will grow up to be a superhero, so they enroll him in the exclusive superhero high school called ""Sky High"", so named because it floats several thousand feet in the air thanks to an anti-gravity device.  When new students (freshmen) arrive at Sky High, they are separated into one of two groups: heroes or sidekicks.  A hero has a real superpower, whereas a sidekick may have a power, but not something powerful.  The man responsible for determining which kids are heroes and which are sidekicks is Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell, who may be remembered for portraying Elvis Presley in the 2002 film""Bubba Ho-tep"", as well as his roles in the various ""Evil Dead"" films).  Upon arrival, the new freshmen are met by Sky High's principal, Principal Powers (Lynda Carter, best known for portraying Wonder Woman in the 1970's TV series of the same name), before being tested by Coach Boomer.  The determination of whether a child is a hero or a sidekick determines not only what classes they attend, but also their social status: sidekicks are generally not socially accepted by the heroes.  Hence, when Will cannot initially demonstrate any superhero powers, he is designated as a sidekick along with most of the new students who rode to Sky High with him in the flying school bus driven by Ron Wilson (Kevin Heffernan).  Of course, Steve & Josie aren't particularly happy that their son may only be a sidekick, but Will may only be a late bloomer, as he demonstrates when he gets into a fight with another student, the flame-throwing Warren Peace (Steven Strait), in the school's cafeteria.  Once it becomes apparent that Will is a hero and not a sidekick, he's moved from the sidekick classes to the hero classes where he gets to spend time with the beautiful senior named Gwen Grayson (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who may be more than she appears.  Will tries to continue to be friends with his former fellow-sidekicks, including his very dear friend Layla Williams (Danielle Panabaker), but Gwen and her friends want to separate Will from them.  As the film progresses, the stage is set for a climatic ending.With good special effects, good acting, an interesting story and good direction (under Mike Mitchell), the family-friendly ""Sky High"" is a very entertaining film for young & old alike.  Those familiar with the Harry Potter stories written by J.K. Rowling may find some similarities between Sky High high school where students are separated and Hogwartz with its separation of students into four houses.  However, whereas Hogwartz separates children based upon personality traits, Sky High separates students based upon abilities.  Overall, I rate ""Sky High"" with a well-deserved 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.",4,"""I can't do anything more to help you.

O'Blenis,"[3, 3]","""Sky High"" is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years, a comedy/adventure that's funny, solid with the action scenes, and thoroughly charming.  A superhero movie that fits far more snugly into the comedy genre than most but that, thank Heaven, doesn't sink into a stupid parody, it's a nice change of pace from the more serious superhero films like the X-Men trilogy or ""Batman Begins"" (which, of course. are also highly recommemded).Sky High is the hidden high school where the superheroes of tomorrow are trained; the main point-of-view character is Will (Michael Angarano), the son of the world's two greatest superheroes, The Commander and Jetstream (Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston).  Coming from such a pedigree, great things are expected from Will - unfortunately, unlike most of the other offspring of established super-people, he has yet to manifest any powers of his own, a secret he's not anxious to divulge.  Starting at the prestigious academy the same day as Will is his lifelong friend Layla (classic girl-next-door character here) Williams (Danielle Panabaker), who has a special way with plants.  The two are part of a clique that forms in the early going, and the student body quietly dreads the upcoming tryouts that determine who gets assigned to which camp - 'superhero' (the sought-after positions) or 'sidekick' (sort of the consolation prize).  Presiding over the tryouts is perennially cranky Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell in a rare non-horror role), who's loud, macho, and secretly very bitter that he never won acknowledgement as one of the world's great superheroes (was Guy Gardner an influence in creating this character?)  Most of the main characters get assigned to sidekick duty, but the clique becomes strained when Will's prodigious superpowers finally manifest themselves and he's welcomed among the A-listers.  Add to this a growing plot thread of some kind of secret threat menacing the school, and you're all set up for a great ride of a movie.  I agree with the reviewer who said that real-life high school should be this much fun.The movie has fun with a lot of classic superhero themes without mocking them, and isn't too goofy that the action sequences become pointless.

As teens enter adolescence and their super powers begin to emerge, Sky High's mission is to train and prepare them for their future lives.Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) the son of two of famous superheroes, is about to enter Sky High.  His father Steve Stronghold (Kurt Russell) is The Commander, a being with super strength.  His mother Josie (Kelly Preston) is known as Jetstream, and can fly at supersonic speeds.  Will's best friend Layla Williams (Danielle Panabaker) has a crush on him.  Will, Layla, and their friends Ethan (Dee Jay Daniels), Zach (Nicholas Braun), and Magenta (Kelly Vitz), are all freshmen at Sky High, and get there via a special flying school bus, driven by Ron Wilson (Kevin Heffernan).  After being greeted by Principal Powers (Lynda Carter, Wonder Woman), the freshman face their first big test, as Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell) evaluates each kid's budding superpowers, and decides whether they are hero material, or more suited to be sidekick providing hero support.Will and his friends are assigned to the hero support class, taught by All-American Boy (Dave Foley).  Will's powers suddenly emerge when he gets into a wild battle in the cafeteria with Warren Peace (Steven Strait), the son of a criminal who was put in prison by his father.  Transferred to the hero group, Will finds himself partnered with senior Gwen Grayson (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who is class president, a technopath, smoking hot, and wants to go to homecoming with him.Solid entertainment for the whole family, Sky High explores life in a most unusual high school, and nicely develops the evolving relationships between Will, Gwen, Warren, and Layla.  The appearance of his powers brings many changes for the dorky Will, and not all of them are positive.  Threads soon come together, as an evil plot that threatens Sky High comes to light.  This sets the stage for a tremendous battle at homecoming, where it takes the combined superpowers of all the young teens, to defeat an unexpected and deadly threat.  The special effects which are solid throughout, rocket to a new heights in the finale.Will is a goofball, makes lots of mistakes, and isn't exactly ideal hero material, but he does the right thing, and steps up when it counts.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead seems too mature to play a high school student, but the beautiful and athletic actress is such a joy to watch.

943369,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BJ7BCA,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 8]","High school coming-of-age comedy drama has several known rules - the `loser' type boy who just cannot fit in the school life; bullying students or teachers; geeky friends of him; one ice queen-like beauty (always blonde); and sudden change of life that comes to him. Now, subvert these rules and add to them the formula of super heroes and super heroines, and what do you get? Is it `Spider-man'? Or `X-Men'?No, it is `Sky High.' Disney's recent attempt to make a family picture out of these familiar materials should have been done several years eariler. The story may not be totally stale, but some may think so after watching two `Spider-man' films. True, `Sky High' provides some amusing moments, but the story of an underdog who becomes a super-hero is far from new and original, and the character of Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) who enters Sky High, a secret academy hovering in the air, specially made for the students with potential super powers, could have been more interesting if we had not known `X-Men.'Anyway, at Sky High all the new students have to be in coveted `Heroes' class or despised `Sidekick' class. In spite of the fact Will's parents are famous and respected superdaddy and supermom `The Commander' and `JetStream' (played by Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston), Will himself cannot prove anything before the mean-spirited Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell), and he goes to the sidekick class. From this point on, `Sky High' becomes mostly a mildly entertaining, but still predictable and forgettable drama.Some comic fans might enjoy watching the film, spotting references to the genre. I am not a big fan of comic books, so I couldn't help feeling that the film, of which sole purpose seems to keep amusing us, is only running its course automatically, wasting every good opportunity to give it originality. In fact, the `super' powers of the cardboard students, Heroes or Sidekicks alike, are not particularly impressive (or weird, campy, whatever) enough, and their acting is not remarkable either. Give me `The Mystery Men' and you know their strange abilities are much more attractive though equally useless.I watched `Sky High' simply because I liked the idea of Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston especially the latter as Super Man- and Wonder Woman-like figures (and don't miss the cameo of Lynda Carter). Strangely Russell's role as Will's daddy is slightly too serious (even he is parodying the accepted hero image), and his good comic timing is lost or undermined by the director's inept and derivative storytelling. Kelly Preston has been doing many thankless roles these days, but even in `Jack Frost' she was allowed to show more what she really can do.Though the film is not without merits, my overall impression is that it is just another OK film from one of the studios with long history trying to catch up with the recent trend set up by the more powerful and imaginative creators -- like the people at Pixar who gave us impeccable `The Incredibles.'",3,"Going to Sky High, Academy for Super Students: OK Family Picture",1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,2988,"['High', 'school', 'coming-of-age', 'comedy', 'drama', 'several', 'known', 'rules', 'loser', 'type', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'fit', 'school', 'life', 'bullying', 'students', 'teachers', 'geeky', 'friends', 'one', 'ice', 'queen-like', 'beauty', 'always', 'blonde', 'sudden', 'change', 'life', 'Now', 'subvert', 'rules', 'add', 'formula', 'super', 'heroes', 'super', 'heroines', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'Spider-man', 'X-Men', 'No', 'Sky', 'High', 'Disney', 'recent', 'attempt', 'make', 'family', 'picture', 'familiar', 'materials', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'several', 'years', 'eariler', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'totally', 'stale', 'may', 'think', 'so', 'watching', 'two', 'Spider-man', 'films', 'True', 'Sky', 'High', 'amusing', 'moments', 'story', 'underdog', 'who', 'super-hero', 'far', 'new', 'original', 'character', 'Will', 'Stronghold', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'who', 'Sky', 'High', 'secret', 'academy', 'hovering', 'air', 'specially', 'made', 'students', 'potential', 'super', 'powers', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'X-Men', ""'Anyway"", 'Sky', 'High', 'new', 'students', 'have', 'be', 'coveted', 'Heroes', 'class', 'despised', 'Sidekick', 'class', 'spite', 'fact', 'Will', 'parents', 'are', 'famous', 'respected', 'superdaddy', 'supermom', 'Commander', 'JetStream', 'played', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Will', 'can', 'not', 'prove', 'anything', 'mean-spirited', 'Coach', 'Boomer', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'sidekick', 'class', 'point', 'Sky', 'High', 'becomes', 'mostly', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'still', 'predictable', 'forgettable', 'drama.Some', 'comic', 'fans', 'might', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', 'spotting', 'references', 'genre', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'comic', 'books', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'film', 'sole', 'purpose', 'keep', 'amusing', 'only', 'running', 'course', 'automatically', 'wasting', 'good', 'opportunity', 'give', 'originality', 'fact', 'super', 'powers', 'cardboard', 'students', 'Heroes', 'Sidekicks', 'alike', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'weird', 'campy', 'enough', 'acting', 'not', 'remarkable', 'either', 'Give', 'Mystery', 'Men', 'know', 'strange', 'abilities', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'attractive', 'equally', 'useless.I', 'watched', 'Sky', 'High', 'simply', 'liked', 'idea', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'especially', 'latter', 'Super', 'Man-', 'Wonder', 'Woman-like', 'figures', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'cameo', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'Strangely', 'Russell', 'role', 'Will', 'daddy', 'slightly', 'too', 'serious', 'even', 'parodying', 'accepted', 'hero', 'image', 'good', 'comic', 'timing', 'lost', 'undermined', 'director', 'inept', 'derivative', 'storytelling', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'been', 'doing', 'many', 'thankless', 'roles', 'days', 'even', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'was', 'allowed', 'show', 'more', 'what', 'really', 'can', 'do.Though', 'film', 'not', 'merits', 'overall', 'impression', 'just', 'OK', 'film', 'one', 'studios', 'long', 'history', 'trying', 'catch', 'up', 'recent', 'trend', 'set', 'up', 'more', 'powerful', 'imaginative', 'creators', 'people', 'Pixar', 'who', 'gave', 'impeccable', 'Incredibles']",N/A
943370,A3OBW7ZP7B1Y1N,B000BJ7BCA,T. VanPool,"[3, 3]","This is a fun, if not stellar, coming-of-age movie that will appeal to the whole family.  The premise is clever; the kids of super heroes go to a special high school where they learn to use their powers while dealing with the social stress and awkwardness of adolescence.  Themes such as the ""first girl friend,"" ""hanging with the cool crowd,"" and ""pleasing dad"" are intelligently handled.  It is also neat to see this sort of movie focus on a male character, and the problems he encounters.The violence here is so comic bookish that it helps keep the laughs and the characters moving.  One doesn't have to worry about the characters dieing, except from embarrassment.  In some ways, that is the worst sort of death to experience, a point that the movie makes.Kurt Russell does an exceptional job playing the slightly oblivious father.  Kelley Preston is the absolutely drop-dead gorgeous mother.  The rest of the cast and characters are fun, although perhaps a bit stereotypical.  This was especially true for Layla (played by Danielle Panabaker), the alternate love interest who is a plant-loving vegan who won't fight unless directly assaulted. She quickly became a caricature of the ""liberal hippy child"" instead of a compelling character.  The plot is also predictable, but give the whole movie, this works OK.Over all, I recommend this movie for benign laughs and a good time.",4,Family Fun,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,1382,"['fun', 'not', 'stellar', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'whole', 'family', 'premise', 'clever', 'kids', 'super', 'heroes', 'go', 'special', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'learn', 'use', 'powers', 'dealing', 'social', 'stress', 'awkwardness', 'adolescence', 'Themes', 'such', 'first', 'girl', 'friend', 'hanging', 'cool', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'dad', 'are', 'intelligently', 'handled', 'also', 'neat', 'see', 'sort', 'movie', 'focus', 'male', 'character', 'problems', 'encounters.The', 'violence', 'here', 'so', 'comic', 'bookish', 'keep', 'laughs', 'characters', 'moving', 'One', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'characters', 'dieing', 'embarrassment', 'ways', 'worst', 'sort', 'death', 'experience', 'point', 'movie', 'makes.Kurt', 'Russell', 'exceptional', 'job', 'playing', 'slightly', 'oblivious', 'father', 'Kelley', 'Preston', 'absolutely', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'mother', 'rest', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'stereotypical', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'Layla', 'played', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'alternate', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'plant-loving', 'vegan', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fight', 'directly', 'assaulted', 'quickly', 'became', 'caricature', 'liberal', 'hippy', 'child', 'instead', 'compelling', 'character', 'plot', 'also', 'predictable', 'give', 'whole', 'movie', 'OK.Over', 'recommend', 'movie', 'benign', 'laughs', 'good', 'time']",N/A
943371,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000BJ7BCA,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","Superhero movies used to be the death knell for a studio. For the longest time Superman and Batman were the only heroes that were worth making a movie of or giving a television show to. Things started to change in the late 1970s with Wonder Woman and The Incredible Hulk being given their own shows. There were a few other superhero movies that were made, but it was incredibly expensive to do so in a way that would make a profit. But along came CGI and everything changed. Now, superhero movies aren't only saving the comic book industry, but they're also becoming a common staple as well as the tentpole franchises that studios build around.Lately a new angle has become prominent in superhero films, that of the superfamilies. Perhaps it was because of the mega-success of Pixar's THE INCREDIBLES, I'm not sure, but movies about superfamilies are the latest fad. Disney knows a good thing when they see it and cashed in on the fad early with SKY HIGH.SKY HIGH is basically the story about a boy growing up and going to high school and learning to come to grips with the man he is becoming. But the boy of this movie ain't no ordinary boy. His name is Will Stronghold and he's the son of the two biggest superheros on the planet (no, not Superman and Wonder Woman): The Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). Will gets to attend a special high school, Sky High. It's the place that all superhero kids go to train and develop their skills and powers. Will's dad hopes that Will has super-strength like himself while his mom would like to see him fly like herself, but is happy for him no matter what. That is a good thing because Will doesn't have any powers and ends up getting tracked into the side kick regiment of the school. Unbeknownst to everyone, though, an evil mastermind is planning revenge and Will is the key to taking over the world.SKY HIGH has a lot of clich&eacute;s and has a predictable plot. But, don't hold that against it. The film has an impressive cast of supporting actors, including Lynda Carter (she once played Wonder Woman) as Principal Powers and Bruce Campbell as Coach Boomer. Also, most of the main characters are teenagers that are portrayed by actual teenagers! That's something rare in a major motion picture (though Disney does a better job of that than any other studio in the business). The main actor's youth added some realism and grounded the film, despite it's farfetched and imaginative story.I wasn't expected to like SKY HIGH very much. I knew it was a Disney film and I was expecting it to be a cheap knock-off of THE INCREDIBLES. It's not a cheap knock-off of that film and surprisingly stands on it's on. The film even has some wit, e.g. in the character named Warren Peace. I laughed quite a bit and surprisingly found myself enjoying the film. As far as family-friendly, the movie doesn't have any major foul language or sex and the violence is of the cartoony-kind. Now, let's all go kick some bad guys' butt.",4,Saving the Earth Is Never Easy,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,2980,"['Superhero', 'movies', 'used', 'be', 'death', 'knell', 'studio', 'longest', 'time', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'were', 'only', 'heroes', 'were', 'worth', 'making', 'movie', 'giving', 'television', 'show', 'Things', 'started', 'change', 'late', '1970s', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'being', 'given', 'own', 'shows', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'superhero', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'was', 'incredibly', 'expensive', 'do', 'so', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'profit', 'came', 'CGI', 'everything', 'changed', 'Now', 'superhero', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'saving', 'comic', 'book', 'industry', ""'re"", 'also', 'becoming', 'common', 'staple', 'as', 'well', 'tentpole', 'studios', 'build', 'around.Lately', 'new', 'angle', 'become', 'prominent', 'superhero', 'films', 'superfamilies', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'mega-success', 'Pixar', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movies', 'superfamilies', 'are', 'latest', 'fad', 'Disney', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'see', 'cashed', 'fad', 'early', 'SKY', 'HIGH.SKY', 'HIGH', 'basically', 'story', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'going', 'high', 'school', 'learning', 'come', 'grips', 'man', 'becoming', 'boy', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'ordinary', 'boy', 'name', 'Will', 'Stronghold', 'son', 'two', 'biggest', 'superheros', 'planet', 'not', 'Superman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Commander', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Jetstream', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Will', 'attend', 'special', 'high', 'school', 'Sky', 'High', 'place', 'superhero', 'kids', 'go', 'train', 'develop', 'skills', 'powers', 'Will', 'dad', 'Will', 'super-strength', 'mom', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'fly', 'happy', 'matter', 'what', 'good', 'thing', 'Will', ""n't"", 'have', 'powers', 'up', 'getting', 'tracked', 'side', 'kick', 'regiment', 'school', 'Unbeknownst', 'everyone', 'though', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'planning', 'revenge', 'Will', 'key', 'taking', 'over', 'world.SKY', 'HIGH', 'lot', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'predictable', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'film', 'impressive', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'including', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'once', 'played', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Principal', 'Powers', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Coach', 'Boomer', 'Also', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'teenagers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'actual', 'teenagers', 'something', 'rare', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'Disney', 'better', 'job', 'other', 'studio', 'business', 'main', 'actor', 'youth', 'added', 'realism', 'grounded', 'film', 'farfetched', 'imaginative', 'story.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'expected', 'like', 'SKY', 'HIGH', 'very', 'much', 'knew', 'was', 'Disney', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'cheap', 'knock-off', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES', 'not', 'cheap', 'knock-off', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'film', 'even', 'wit', 'e.g', 'character', 'named', 'Warren', 'Peace', 'laughed', 'quite', 'bit', 'surprisingly', 'found', 'enjoying', 'film', 'As', 'far', 'family-friendly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'major', 'foul', 'language', 'sex', 'violence', 'cartoony-kind', 'Now', 'let', 'go', 'kick', 'bad', 'guys', 'butt']",N/A

The reason I gave this movie high marks is because it had mass appeal. You could sit a five-year old in front of this movie, and they would be rapt by the special effects. You could show it to teens and preteens and they would empathize with the characters. You could watch it as an adult and just be throroughly entertained by it from start to finish.All in all, the money I paid for the DVD, I feel is money well spent. It is definitely a movie you could watch over and over again.So if you're thinking about buying it for someone young, go right ahead. There is nothing risque in the storyline.

943374,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000BJ7BCA,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[6, 6]","A great pop philosopher once said, ""You may leave school but it never leaves you""*, nowhere is that more true than at the high school for the off-spring of superheroes Sky High literally located among the clouds. Although this superhero satire isn't quite as deft as  ""The Incredibles"" or even ""Mystery Men"" was at its best, it's an enjoyable romp that kids will laugh at and parents won't feel embarrassed to watch. Sure it may come across as a glorified Disney TV movie but what elevates the film above that are the performances of the cast. Will (Michael Angarano) is the son of the greatest superhero the world has ever known; The Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). When not fighting crime this married duo fight the war of real estate sales. When it appears that Will has no superpowers, he's worried that he'll disappoint his dad and end up just relegated to sidekick classes at his new high school Sky High. His worst fears seem a reality when in his first day at school Coach Boomer (the wonderful Bruce Campbell) drops a car on him and the best Will can do is avoid being crushed putting him in the ""sidekick"" category like his teacher The Commander's former sidekick Mr. Boy (Dave Foley). Now Will not only has to deal with peer pressure, the hazards of dating and razzing from the school bullies he also has to figure out a way to survive as nothing more than a glorified geek. Will discovers resources he didn't think he had when the school, his friends and his family are threatened by a seemingly unstoppable villain.As usual Buena Vista provides an exceptional crisp transfer. There weren't any analog defects that I could note and, truly, this transfer looks super most of the time. But like all superheroes this DVD does have its weakness-there's some minor edge enhancement noticeable in some scenes and some minor compression artifacts particularly in scenes that involved swirling mists and/or dust clouds. On the whole The Commander would be proud. The sound is equally super with remarkably crisp and clear dialogue. The surround speakers are nicely used putting you in the middle of the action.While it appears that this film might have some mild mannered extras, most of them are pretty good overall. ""Breaking Down the Walls: The Stunts of `Sky High'"" focuses on the stunt action of the film and, given that this is a fantasy film with flying superheroes and kids that shoot fire out of their hands, there's quite a few of those.  ""Welcome to Sky High"" is a behind-the-scenes featurette. It resembles the promotional featurette that the Disney Channel ran when the show was in theaters. It's not profound but then again neither is the movie and it does provide enough of a glimpse behind-the-scenes to satisfying most kids. We also get an alternate opening sequence along with the ""I Melt with You"" (a remake of the 80's hit single by the British band Modern English) music video featuring the band Bowling for Soup.An enjoyable film that probably would have been a Disney Channel original movie if not for the star power and visual effects involved, ""Sky High"" won't insult kids nor will they be demanding a sequel. Parents will enjoy some of the silly hijinks that happens in the film as well. It's worth a rental and might keep your kids occupied while you're busy wrapping those Christmas gifts.*Songwriter Andy Partridge ""Playground"" from XTC's album ""Wasp Star""",4,"Enjoyable family romp with ""Super"" star power",1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,3413,"['great', 'pop', 'philosopher', 'once', 'said', 'may', 'leave', 'school', 'never', '*', 'nowhere', 'more', 'true', 'high', 'school', 'off-spring', 'superheroes', 'Sky', 'High', 'literally', 'located', 'clouds', 'superhero', 'satire', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'deft', 'Incredibles', 'even', 'Mystery', 'Men', 'was', 'best', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'kids', 'will', 'laugh', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'watch', 'Sure', 'may', 'come', 'glorified', 'Disney', 'TV', 'movie', 'what', 'film', 'are', 'performances', 'cast', 'Will', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'son', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'Commander', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Jetstream', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'When', 'not', 'fighting', 'crime', 'married', 'duo', 'fight', 'war', 'real', 'estate', 'sales', 'When', 'Will', 'superpowers', 'worried', ""'ll"", 'disappoint', 'dad', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'relegated', 'sidekick', 'classes', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'Sky', 'High', 'worst', 'fears', 'seem', 'reality', 'when', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'Coach', 'Boomer', 'wonderful', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'car', 'best', 'Will', 'can', 'do', 'avoid', 'being', 'crushed', 'putting', 'sidekick', 'category', 'teacher', 'Commander', 'former', 'sidekick', 'Mr', 'Boy', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'Now', 'Will', 'not', 'only', 'deal', 'peer', 'pressure', 'hazards', 'dating', 'razzing', 'school', 'bullies', 'also', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'survive', 'nothing', 'more', 'glorified', 'geek', 'Will', 'discovers', 'resources', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'when', 'school', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'threatened', 'seemingly', 'unstoppable', 'villain.As', 'usual', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'exceptional', 'crisp', 'transfer', 'were', ""n't"", 'analog', 'could', 'note', 'truly', 'transfer', 'super', 'most', 'time', 'superheroes', 'DVD', 'have', 'weakness-there', 'minor', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'noticeable', 'scenes', 'minor', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'involved', 'swirling', 'mists', 'and/or', 'dust', 'clouds', 'whole', 'Commander', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'sound', 'equally', 'super', 'remarkably', 'crisp', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'surround', 'speakers', 'are', 'nicely', 'used', 'putting', 'middle', 'action.While', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'mild', 'mannered', 'extras', 'most', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'Breaking', 'Down', 'Walls', 'Stunts', 'Sky', 'High', 'focuses', 'stunt', 'action', 'film', 'given', 'fantasy', 'film', 'flying', 'superheroes', 'kids', 'shoot', 'fire', 'hands', 'quite', 'few', 'Welcome', 'Sky', 'High', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'promotional', 'featurette', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'ran', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'theaters', 'not', 'profound', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'provide', 'glimpse', 'behind-the-scenes', 'satisfying', 'most', 'kids', 'also', 'get', 'alternate', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Melt', 'remake', '80', 'hit', 'single', 'British', 'band', 'Modern', 'English', 'music', 'video', 'featuring', 'band', 'Bowling', 'Soup.An', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'original', 'movie', 'not', 'star', 'power', 'visual', 'effects', 'involved', 'Sky', 'High', 'wo', ""n't"", 'insult', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'demanding', 'sequel', 'Parents', 'will', 'enjoy', 'silly', 'hijinks', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'rental', 'might', 'keep', 'kids', 'occupied', ""'re"", 'busy', 'wrapping', 'Christmas', 'gifts', '*Songwriter', 'Andy', 'Partridge', 'Playground', 'XTC', 'album', 'Wasp', 'Star']",N/A
