373864,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303422977,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","One of the more impressive features in `Proof' is that it manages to strike a chord in the viewer almost unknowingly.  It really wasn't until the film was finished that I realized just how much of an impact that small film can have.  It perfectly addresses the need for total and complete trust but balances that out with the need for forgiveness, the need for patience and the need for understanding.  The film spends a great deal of time building trust with the audience, helping them to understand why it's characters need each other the way that they do and then it effortlessly snaps the trust in two and demands the audience decide the moral road to take.  It shows the frustration that comes with frigid demands and how we can ultimately end up alone if we refuse to give any slack.  No one is perfect and this film helps show the importance of understanding that very fact and conceding to it.The film revolves around Martin, played by Hugo Weaving, a blind man who takes photographs of his surroundings as proof of his existence.  By a chance meeting at a restaurant he meets busboy Andrew, played by Russell Crowe, and an immediate friendship is sparked.  The film does a wonderful job, all the way down to the boyishly free spirited score, of building the feeling of childlike friendship.  The two of them truly have fun together and we have fun watching them interact.  Andrew is the type of guy every other guy wants to be friends with, and Crowe's portrayal is so convincing and natural the audience just can't take their eyes off of him.  Weaving, while not the greatest actor in the world, delivers here as well, playing reclusive and unsure and tortured by a childhood unwanted well enough.  His performance comes off a bit tense and stiff in some scenes but is forgivable.  It's easy to see why he was chosen for the role of Agent Smith in `The Matrix' for he exhibits that stiff and proper delivery even when he should be relaxed.The true crutch of the film lies on the shoulders of Celia, Martin's housekeeper.  Harboring a crush on Martin that he doesn't dare embrace, Celia starts to resent him as he resents her.  It boils down to frustrated attraction, even on the part of Martin.  He's attracted to her but he doesn't trust her and so he repels her.  Genevieve Picot does a fantastic job playing Celia with enough sass and cattiness yet underlining sadness that we can feel for her as much as we understand Martin's reservations.  When she begins to target Andrew, who has no problem embracing her advances, the bond between Martin and Andrew is threatened.Crowe, while very young here, commands his role with such fervor and dedication and natural charm that it would be easy to predict he'd be an Oscar winner.  While he allows others to shine he still proves to be the most talented of the cast in question.  His performance is the most memorable and his character is the most relatable.  Picot also deserves praise for creating a wonderfully memorable character in Celia.  She's an utter standout.  The final confrontation between Andrew and Martin lays the groundwork for this entire film and the feeling and morale that it should impress upon the audience.  Everybody lies, just not all the time, and how true and important is that very fact!",5,Truly a delightful film with a subject that should affect everyone...,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,3273,"['One', 'more', 'impressive', 'features', 'Proof', 'strike', 'chord', 'viewer', 'almost', 'unknowingly', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'was', 'finished', 'realized', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'impact', 'small', 'film', 'can', 'have', 'perfectly', 'need', 'total', 'complete', 'trust', 'balances', 'out', 'need', 'forgiveness', 'need', 'patience', 'need', 'understanding', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'building', 'trust', 'audience', 'helping', 'understand', 'why', 'characters', 'need', 'other', 'way', 'do', 'then', 'effortlessly', 'trust', 'two', 'audience', 'decide', 'moral', 'road', 'take', 'frustration', 'frigid', 'demands', 'how', 'can', 'ultimately', 'end', 'up', 'alone', 'refuse', 'give', 'slack', 'one', 'perfect', 'film', 'show', 'importance', 'understanding', 'very', 'fact', 'conceding', 'it.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'Martin', 'played', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'blind', 'man', 'who', 'photographs', 'surroundings', 'proof', 'existence', 'chance', 'meeting', 'restaurant', 'busboy', 'Andrew', 'played', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'immediate', 'friendship', 'sparked', 'film', 'wonderful', 'job', 'way', 'boyishly', 'free', 'spirited', 'score', 'building', 'feeling', 'childlike', 'friendship', 'two', 'truly', 'have', 'fun', 'together', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'interact', 'Andrew', 'type', 'guy', 'other', 'guy', 'be', 'friends', 'Crowe', 'portrayal', 'so', 'convincing', 'natural', 'audience', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'Weaving', 'not', 'greatest', 'actor', 'world', 'delivers', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'reclusive', 'unsure', 'tortured', 'childhood', 'unwanted', 'well', 'enough', 'performance', 'off', 'bit', 'tense', 'stiff', 'scenes', 'forgivable', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'chosen', 'role', 'Agent', 'Smith', 'Matrix', 'stiff', 'proper', 'delivery', 'even', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'relaxed.The', 'true', 'crutch', 'film', 'shoulders', 'Celia', 'Martin', 'housekeeper', 'Harboring', 'crush', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'dare', 'embrace', 'Celia', 'resent', 'down', 'frustrated', 'attraction', 'even', 'part', 'Martin', 'attracted', ""n't"", 'trust', 'so', 'Genevieve', 'Picot', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'Celia', 'enough', 'sass', 'cattiness', 'yet', 'underlining', 'sadness', 'can', 'feel', 'as', 'much', 'understand', 'Martin', 'reservations', 'When', 'target', 'Andrew', 'who', 'problem', 'embracing', 'advances', 'bond', 'Martin', 'Andrew', 'threatened.Crowe', 'very', 'young', 'here', 'role', 'such', 'fervor', 'dedication', 'natural', 'charm', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'predict', ""'d"", 'be', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'others', 'shine', 'still', 'be', 'most', 'talented', 'cast', 'question', 'performance', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'most', 'relatable', 'Picot', 'also', 'praise', 'creating', 'wonderfully', 'memorable', 'character', 'Celia', 'utter', 'standout', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Andrew', 'Martin', 'groundwork', 'entire', 'film', 'feeling', 'morale', 'should', 'impress', 'audience', 'Everybody', 'just', 'not', 'time', 'how', 'true', 'important', 'very', 'fact']",Proof VHS

373868,A1EHD9FFW3274W,6303422977,copy_1@hotmail.com,"[13, 14]","34. PROOF (drama, 1991) Martin (Hugo Weaving) has been blind from birth. Unloved by his mother because of his handicap, she would lie to him when describing the outside world. Because of this Martin does not rely on  anyone and instead takes photos that serve to 'proof' of things he can't  see. He meets Andy (Russell Crowe) young kitchen-hand whose simple honesty  Martin comes to trust. They become friends and for the first time Martin is  able to trust someone. Celia (Genieve Picot) is in love with Martin ever  since she started working as his housekeeper. Though Martin doesn't love  her he keeps her on because it makes him feel good. They both like the idea  of controlling each other in different ways. Celia's jealousy, though,  causes her to destroy Martin's newfound friendship.Critique: Perceptive  character study was written and directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse. Her feminine  touch shines through as deceit; trust and jealousy are the main themes  (similar to a soapy). The interesting (masochistic) relationship of the 3  characters is fun to watch. They are all damaged people looking to feed off  someone else so their egos can be mended somewhat. In a way, the story is  also about obsession and how Martin's handicap makes it all the more  difficult to fight back. There are also hysterical touches of comedy, such  as when Martin is taught by Andy to drive a car for the first time and are  pulled over by police. Made in 1991, at a time when Australian films were  making a resurgence ('Death in Brunswick', 'Romper Stomper', etc), Proof  has 'proven' to be the best of the lot.

It's harder than ever to find originality in storytelling, but Proof achieves that rarity with its off-kilter tale of Martin, a paranoid, blind photographer (yes, that's what he is) living in Melbourne, Australia, who ponders whether or not his mother abandoned him by faking her death during his own childhood, because at her funeral the testimony of his sensitive hands compelled the young Martin to believe her casket was in fact empty. Living a life of comfortable privilege yet an existence devoid of an ability to bond with most others, Martin snaps photographs at random in a nearby park, then seeks out the sighted to describe the pictures to him. Martin's often cruel housekeeper, Celia, who harbors a seething, acidic form of love for her caustic employer, oversees the care of Martin, yet also undertakes tiny but effective cruelties against him, such as her frequent re-arranging of household furnishings, which confuses the blind man and also presents a hazard to him as he plods through his home. Martin's newfound friend, Andy, a dishwasher at a local restaurant, played to expected perfection by the always brilliant Russell Crowe, presents a threat to the cold Celia, who in a perverse ploy makes love to Andy in an effort to alienate his affection for Martin. There is also a later attempted seduction of the alternately pathetic and odious Martin, Celia's war of cruelties escalates, and the ending arrives with either a moment of liberation or a profound rejection of love, however it might be perceived by the individual viewer.

This movie was facinating, a great look at the weight trust carries in a relationship and how it can easily be minipulated and twisted and all together abused.  Some say that this is one of the only films were Crowe doesn't outshine his fellow actors, but to tell you the truth he is still by far the best here.  Hugo is not the greatest of actors, but this my friends is his tryumphant performance...the best of his career.  The woman who plays Celia is wonderful, you hate her and love her and hate to love her.  Hugo does very well as Martin and there were even times when my wife cried becasue she felt so sorry for him.  He played his role brilliantly.  But it was none other than Crowe who stole the show bringing charm and devotion to his role.  It was nice to see him laughing and smiling alot.  He looks so young in this film, but still has that dignified air about him.  He is a true Aussie legend.

You need proof, and this is what Martin (Hugo Weaving) seeks.  He is a man who projects onto others the lovelessness of his own soul. He believed as a child that his mother died to get away from the shame of having a son who was blind.  Even as an adult he believed she lied to him.  He goes to the mortuary and is led to her grave where he reads the head stone with his fingers.  He asks the mortician if a coffin is sometimes buried empty.  The mortician asks why anyone would do that.  Martin suggests a prank.  The mortician replies, &quot;Seems like a pretty expensive prank.&quot;  Martin spends his whole life obsessively seeking proof because he can trust no one.  Until he meets Andy.  He trusts Andy.It hardly need be said that Andy, played with boyish charm and just the right amount of discovery by Russell Crowe, will both disappoint Martin and teach him a lesson.  Martin certainly needs some kind of lesson.  He exploits his housekeeper Celia's obsessive love for him, tormenting her by keeping her on, while denying her love as he inflicts little humiliations.  For her part Celia, played with a penetrating and desperate sexuality by Genevi&egrave;ve Picot, mothers him and seeks to dominate.  She wants to keep Martin dependant on her in the hope that someday he will seek her love.  She controls his life, teaching the dog to prefer her and to come to her when signaled.  In her frustration she plays little tricks on Martin, such as putting objects in his path so he will run into them.  When Andy threatens to become important to Martin, predictably she seduces him.  Thus we have our triangle.  Andy also serves as an objectifying device to underscore the obsessions of Martin and Celia.Jocelyn Moorhouse wrote and directed this original little masterpiece of dark humor from down under.  She carefully worked out the character-driven story so that humor and tragedy are in balance and we experience the revelations from the perspective of all three characters.  Nothing is fake or hackneyed and no one point of view is preferred.  She has the gift of seeing more than one side of the human condition, and it is this gift that makes her scenes so effective.  Note that the drive-in theater scene depends on our knowing what Martin is doing and why, while seeing his actions from the point of view of the bikers.  He faces the bikers from the driver's seat in the next car and holds up a packet of prophylactics.

Uno-teeny-tiny problemo. He's blind. So he has to find someone he can trust to describe the photos to him. The person he chooses is Andy, a kitchen worker at a local restaurant, played by a very young looking Russell Crowe.Hugo Weaving as Martin displays his trademark intelligence and sensitivity. Martin is smarter than hell but socially maladept. Andy is a charming ne'er-do-well who accepts the ""job"" of being Martin's eyes out of a combination of pity, what-the-hell, and actual liking for the guy.Genevi&egrave;ve Picot does a fine job as Celia, Martin's housekeeper who is intensely attracted to him and regularly tries to seduce him - advances he routinely rejects. Genevi&egrave;ve's Celia is obsessive, manipulative, domineering, rude and yet still, in some bizarre, disturbing fashion, sexy. And if you think that's easy....try it some time.As the movie starts, Martin's life is extremely regimented and limited. His only real relationship is one of conflict with Celia whom he keeps at arms length. But still he endures the pressure of her advances, her attempts at manipulation, the little cruelties when she's displeased with him and deliberately moves objects into his path for him to trip over. His relationship with her may be sick, but she's all he has. Celia had the job of describing Martin's photos to him before Martin gave the job to Andy because - for good reason - he doesn't trust Celia.We have two great actors (and one great actress) in this film, all doing extraordinary work. In a quiet way, this movie is about Martin battling for his soul, fighting to become a whole human being. His relationship with Andy is the first time in his life he's ever reached out to another person. It's the story of how this friendship between very different individuals, its rewards and disappointments, gives Martin the strength to make badly needed changes in his life.Favorite line of the movie: ""I forgot."" Trust me, in the context it's delivered, this is absolutely hilarious. My girlfriend, after watching Proof with me, for weeks and months afterward, would suddenly look at me and say, ""I forgot,"" before bursting into laughter.Proof is a superb film, an actor's movie with performers fully up to the job.

All I had to do was read a description of Weaving as a blind photographer, and I was in.Turns out Proof was actually pretty well known in its day, having picked up a slew of Australian Film Institute awards and a Golden Camera at Cannes. Didn't do a great deal of box office, but that's rarely an indication of whether a movie's actually good or not. But Hugo Weaving and Russell Crowe when they were both still relative unknowns? How can you go wrong?Weaving, as I mentioned, plays Martin, a blind photographer, while Crowe is Andy, a dishwasher at a local restaurant. To complete the triangle, we have Celia (veteran TV actress Genevieve Picot), Martin's housekeeper, who's a bit in love with him. Martin and Andy meet after a mishap in which Martin stumbles over some of the restaurant's garbage in the alley, injuring a local stray cat; Martin and Andy take the cat to the vet and bond. Soon Andy meets Celia, and the stage is set.Moorhouse (A Thousand Acres), who also wrote the script, came up with something potentially quite powerful, but there are pieces of it that never quite gel. Martin's take on why he refuses to return Celia's affections comes off as facile, and seems to serve no purpose other than to set up a possible love triangle; Celia herself doesn't really impress as someone who'd be willing to sit around and take it. Only Andy, played to a T by Crowe, comes off as truly genuine here (which is ironic, considering Andy is a completely surface creature, ruled entirely by his instincts).An interesting movie, but not an especially accomplished one. Worth checking out to see two wonderful actors when both were still rising stars, a year or two away from each's breakout performance. ** ",3,"Interesting, but never quite comes together.",1192060800,"10 11, 2007",2007,2142,"['Proof', 'Jacqueline', 'Moorhouse', '1991', 'days', 'anyone', 'who', 'Proof', 'probably', 'so', 'young', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'something', 'was', 'unaware', 'when', 'first', 'tacked', 'ever-growing', 'list', 'movies', 'watch', 'knew', 'was', 'early', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'film', 'discovered', 'same', 'name', 'decent-but-overrated', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'flick', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'enough', 'spark', 'interest', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'read', 'description', 'Weaving', 'blind', 'photographer', 'was', 'in.Turns', 'out', 'Proof', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'known', 'day', 'having', 'picked', 'up', 'slew', 'Australian', 'Film', 'Institute', 'awards', 'Golden', 'Camera', 'Cannes', 'Did', ""n't"", 'do', 'great', 'deal', 'box', 'office', 'rarely', 'indication', 'movie', 'actually', 'good', 'not', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Weaving', 'mentioned', 'Martin', 'blind', 'photographer', 'Crowe', 'Andy', 'dishwasher', 'local', 'restaurant', 'complete', 'triangle', 'have', 'Celia', 'veteran', 'TV', 'actress', 'Genevieve', 'Picot', 'Martin', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'bit', 'love', 'Martin', 'Andy', 'meet', 'mishap', 'Martin', 'restaurant', 'garbage', 'alley', 'injuring', 'local', 'stray', 'cat', 'Martin', 'Andy', 'take', 'cat', 'vet', 'bond', 'Soon', 'Andy', 'Celia', 'stage', 'set.Moorhouse', 'Thousand', 'Acres', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'came', 'up', 'something', 'potentially', 'quite', 'powerful', 'are', 'pieces', 'never', 'quite', 'gel', 'Martin', 'take', 'why', 'return', 'Celia', 'affections', 'off', 'facile', 'serve', 'purpose', 'other', 'set', 'up', 'possible', 'love', 'triangle', 'Celia', ""n't"", 'really', 'impress', 'someone', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'sit', 'around', 'take', 'Only', 'Andy', 'played', 'T', 'Crowe', 'off', 'truly', 'genuine', 'here', 'ironic', 'considering', 'Andy', 'completely', 'surface', 'creature', 'ruled', 'entirely', 'instincts', '.An', 'interesting', 'movie', 'not', 'especially', 'accomplished', 'one', 'checking', 'out', 'see', 'two', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'rising', 'stars', 'year', 'two', 'away', 'breakout', 'performance', '**']",Proof VHS

373888,A1B22L23YH8CDW,6303422977,"""tierneyfan""","[8, 8]","This low-budget film from down-under is a character-study of three everyday people, played by Hugo Weaving, Genevieve Picot, and Russell Crowe. Be warned that it does not have a happy Hollywood ending, and similar to ""Secrets and Lies"", is more character rather than action-driven.Weaving, who later stars in ""The Matrix"", shows his trademark sterness as a blind photographer and misanthrope.  He has lost touch with humanity, scarred by a notion since childhood that his mother had rejected him because of his handicap.  To verify what he senses, he photographs his surroundings.  He has a seemingly cold-hearted housekeeper, who he torments.  She continues to work for him because she's secretly in love with him and his dependence on her at least partially satisfies her desires.  Their relationship becomes threatened when he befriends a dishwasher at a local restaurant.  Weaving's character trusts the dishwasher, Andy, played by a young Russell Crowe, to describe the photos he takes.  Fearing that she'd be displaced, the housekeeper sets out to discredit Andy and makes her moves on both Andy and Weaving.The performances are all superb.  Picot shows the vulnerability of a woman who masks her loneliness with a cold exterior.  As the film progresses, the viewer increasingly sympathizes with her.  Her character is the most interesting of the three.  And reminiscent of a young Mel Gibson, a lean and not-yet-so-masculine Crowe plays Andy with sensitivity, innocence, and a hunkiness and easy-going down-to-earthness that he'd project in his later films.
