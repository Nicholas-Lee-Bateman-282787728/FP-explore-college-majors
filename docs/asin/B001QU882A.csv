1232061,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B001QU882A,&#308;&#308;,"[0, 0]","After trying some of the other 10 Minute Solution dance DVDs, I was very eager to try this one.  And it was a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but compared to the others, this DVD just didn't measure up quite as I expected it to.Petra Kolber leads this DVD, and she tends to teach the choreography very rapidly, not giving you much time to learn it before moving onto the next move.  I didn't find this much of a problem, however, because a lot of moves repeated themselves in her 10 minute workouts such as the rock/triple step, throwdown, box step, and mambo.  The choreography on the most part consisted of these basic aerobic moves with a slight dance twist, which I found to be good cardio but not as dancey as I would have liked.The segments on the DVD are:Belly Blaster - This routine is pretty much a jazzy routine that will contain most of the basic moves that you will see later.  It is pretty easy and straight forward with a lot of hip shaking going on in it.  It was a fun routine, but it wasn't a favorite with me.Latin Flavor Waist Sizzler - THIS was my favorite routine, as Petra added a Latin feel to these aerobic dance steps.  There were, once again, some basic steps in this routine, but there were also some complicated steps such as the Tango in it, as well.  This routine challenged me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!Attitude and Energy - This was a kind of retro dance style aerobic section with moves such as the Elvis in it.  I was expecting to like this routine a lot more, but once again, it contained many basic moves that I had seen before with just a couple of things to make it slightly fresh.Fat Burning Beat - This was a really nice mixture of hip-hop and jazz dance steps.  It had everything from Raise the Roof to Chest Pumps in it.  This was probably the danciest of all the workouts, and I was extremely pleased with this combo.Dancer's Silhouette - I wasn't expecting to like this segment, but it turned out to be great!  There are elegant moves in this routine, and I really enjoying the flow of the dance.  Each move made me feel good, and I really felt my core engage in this routine.Now, the core is supposed to be the main focus in all of the routines, but really in order to get a great ab workout, you'd have to really focus on your abs the entire time which would take away from the fun of the dance.  And, yes, while the dance moves repeat themselves and are very generic, they are fun, and they move fast enough to keep my interest.  Another thing to notice is that the routines are symmetrical, meaning that once you complete the routine on say your right leg, you then go on to do it on your left leg.Overall, this is a pretty good workout DVD that goes a little too fast for beginners, yet has a few too many repetitious moves for the advanced.  However, it goes very quickly to keep the viewer from being bored, earning it a rating of 4 stars.",4,A fast-moving workout that consists of generic steps,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,2893,"['trying', 'other', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'was', 'very', 'eager', 'try', 'one', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'compared', 'others', 'DVD', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'quite', 'expected', 'Kolber', 'DVD', 'teach', 'choreography', 'very', 'rapidly', 'not', 'giving', 'much', 'time', 'learn', 'moving', 'next', 'move', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'problem', 'however', 'lot', 'moves', 'repeated', '10', 'minute', 'workouts', 'such', 'rock/triple', 'step', 'throwdown', 'box', 'step', 'mambo', 'choreography', 'most', 'part', 'consisted', 'basic', 'aerobic', 'moves', 'slight', 'dance', 'twist', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'cardio', 'not', 'as', 'dancey', 'would', 'have', 'liked.The', 'segments', 'DVD', 'are', 'Belly', 'Blaster', 'routine', 'pretty', 'much', 'jazzy', 'routine', 'will', 'contain', 'most', 'basic', 'moves', 'will', 'see', 'later', 'pretty', 'easy', 'straight', 'forward', 'lot', 'hip', 'shaking', 'going', 'was', 'fun', 'routine', 'was', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'me.Latin', 'Flavor', 'Waist', 'Sizzler', 'THIS', 'was', 'favorite', 'routine', 'Petra', 'added', 'Latin', 'feel', 'aerobic', 'dance', 'steps', 'were', 'once', 'again', 'basic', 'steps', 'routine', 'were', 'also', 'complicated', 'steps', 'such', 'Tango', 'as', 'well', 'routine', 'challenged', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Attitude', 'Energy', 'was', 'kind', 'retro', 'dance', 'style', 'aerobic', 'section', 'moves', 'such', 'Elvis', 'was', 'expecting', 'like', 'routine', 'lot', 'more', 'once', 'again', 'contained', 'many', 'basic', 'moves', 'had', 'seen', 'just', 'couple', 'things', 'make', 'slightly', 'fresh.Fat', 'Burning', 'Beat', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'mixture', 'hip-hop', 'jazz', 'dance', 'steps', 'had', 'everything', 'Raise', 'Roof', 'Chest', 'Pumps', 'was', 'probably', 'danciest', 'workouts', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'combo.Dancer', 'Silhouette', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'like', 'segment', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'are', 'elegant', 'moves', 'routine', 'really', 'enjoying', 'flow', 'dance', 'move', 'made', 'feel', 'good', 'really', 'felt', 'core', 'engage', 'routine.Now', 'core', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'focus', 'routines', 'really', 'order', 'get', 'great', 'ab', 'workout', ""'d"", 'have', 'really', 'focus', 'entire', 'time', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'fun', 'dance', 'yes', 'dance', 'repeat', 'are', 'very', 'generic', 'are', 'fun', 'move', 'fast', 'enough', 'keep', 'interest', 'thing', 'notice', 'routines', 'are', 'symmetrical', 'meaning', 'once', 'complete', 'routine', 'say', 'right', 'leg', 'then', 'go', 'do', 'left', 'leg.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'workout', 'DVD', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'beginners', 'yet', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'repetitious', 'moves', 'advanced', 'However', 'very', 'quickly', 'keep', 'viewer', 'being', 'bored', 'earning', 'rating', '4', 'stars']",10 Minute Solution: Dance Off Belly Fat

1232064,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B001QU882A,Chandler,"[0, 0]","Picture it.You're on vacation taking a tour of some television studios.You are offered a seat to view &#34;Dancing with the Stars&#34;.Then, midshow, much to your shock and surprise, they pull you out of the audience and tell you you were supposed to know the steps and it's your turn to be on stage.Go!**shudder**I felt as though such a nightmare had come to fruition upon pushing &#34;play&#34; during this cardio dvd.Don't get me wrong now... I gotta start out by saying it's not that I am not fit.it's not that I don't know dance steps.it's not that I hate to workout...Ya gotta understand, I workout 6 days every week to a collection of over 100 workout dvds that I've collected through the years and I rotate them to get a variety.I have many many other of the ten minute workouts and LOVE them.I have other dvds by Petra, the instructor, that I enjoy as well.so I'm not just being hard on her due to some lack of comparison, mind you. I gotta throw that in..But I'll get to all that. First, it's just not a calorie burner according to my heart rate monitor. If it were, I'd give it more stars for that alone...but you are more likely to burn higher calories if you just wash your car or dance to the radio. sorry, I wish it weren't so but it is what it is.Secondly, I think if you are anything like me you'll be far less frustrated if you just dance to the radio as well. There is NO warm up (I guess it's not really needed though since you don't burn many calories; maybe there is just no strain) and she just starts dancing...NO instruction, no cueing to speak of throughout. It is truly like being thrown on stage with a partner doing their half of the routine on Dancing with the Stars and you know you are expected to be the other half of the routine following along, but you keep shouting &#34;Wait y'all!! No one taught me the steps!! You forgot to teach me the routine!&#34;but here's the thing. There are people who would find themselves in the midst of a choreographed dance routine that they were never taught and they'd pick it up somehow on the fly. They already know the names of all the dance steps so if someone shouts it out they don't even need to think or get instruction; they just begin moving in time to the foxtrot or merinque or chacha or whatever. Unfortunately for me, that,my friends, is not me. Should you identify with my own dilemna, then this one will leave you in the dust as well without instruction....unless you majored in dance in college with a minor in choreography.but even if you don't have that degree in choreography, you'd best have majored in dance because she'll just call out names of various dance steps and you are expected to keep up. That, by the way, is her &#34;instruction&#34;.So, I gave it one star for that...there ARE professional dancers out there who will love this one...especially if you have a knack for mindreading as well and can figure out what the heck you are to do next. I kid.Otherwise, God love her, you'll wind up hitting &#34;rewind&#34; a whole lot or pausing to go &#34;wha???&#34; as she dances away on her own.I agree with the other reviewer as well that adding more dancers would have helped but it would still be a dvd that goes in the &#34;giveaway&#34; pile. the cueing is just that bad, I'm sorry to say.Maybe if you did this dvd every day for awhile...I would say if you are great at dance then this one's for you.

I understand how it can be frustrating for some exercisers, because the choreography is fast and with some complexity. That said, you will definitely get an effective cardio & core workout when you do it correctly. All the segments end with a very short but efficient stretch that feels like a continuation of the dance.- Latin Beat: My favorite. Quick-moving latin combos.You get mambos,chachas, flamenco, merengue and even a little tango. I hada lot of fun learning this one.- Dancer's Sillouette: The emphasis here is to elongate the body doing aroutine that feels like a tai-chi and modern dance fusion.I feel taller and more graceful after this segment, so Ido it last. Easy to learn because is the slowest.- Belly Blaster: The fastest; you'll need lots of energy. The routine iscomplex, but it really works the abs. The moves range fromjazz squares to mambos and snakes.- Attitude & Energy: A sexy routine , I feel like a backup dancer. You'lldo a lot of shoulder moves, attitude walks, a kickball-change and arm reaches.-Fat Burning Beat: You'll burn  calories and work your core withchest-pops, hip moves and knee-ups.These routines are taught by Petra Kolber, who has like two decades ofexperience in fitness and who was the star of many Reebok videos.

I love Petra - she is great and has amazing enthusiasm and provides a lot of encouragement as always, but this isn't good at all.  I'm actually even sorry that I purchased it.First off, it has as much chance as burning off belly fat as eating M & M's.  Secondly, she is too quick to get onto the next step and there isn't clear instruction on how to do the moves.  Sure, you can pick them up down the track, but there is no proper guidance and also, being that she's the only dancer, it's hard to see her positioning ... there should either be more dancers so you can see people at different angles and copy their moves, or there needs to be clear instruction.  I didn't say Clearer instruction, because there is actually none at all.I didn't enjoy this and in fact I barely even made it through the very first segment (the latin portion); not because I'm not fit, but because it's 'complicated'.  Even if you are co-ordinated, it's not overly easy and any exercise routine that needs too much figuring out is a waste of my time.

I figured there would be more instruction on how to do the moves, but it was very minimal.  Some of the segments are easier to follow than others.  Of the 5, I think that Dancer's Silhoette was the easiest to follow.",2,Maybe I'm just not coordinated..,1250899200,"08 22, 2009",2009,371,"['did', 'best', 'will', 'keep', 'using', 'moves', 'are', 'really', 'hard', 'follow.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dancing', 'background', 'may', 'be', 'mistake', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'instruction', 'how', 'do', 'moves', 'was', 'very', 'minimal', 'segments', 'are', 'easier', 'follow', 'others', '5', 'think', 'Dancer', 'Silhoette', 'was', 'easiest', 'follow']",10 Minute Solution: Dance Off Belly Fat
1232073,A245HJ999FOPRI,B001QU882A,Tchik182,"[12, 12]","Before I counter some of the claims by other reviewers, I'll tell you about the DVD.  As billed, the DVD consists of 5, 10 minute segments, supposedly designed to work your abs.  Unless I concentrate extremely hard on my abs the entire time, this work out doesn't really work your abs.  The DVD is probably designed to decreased over all body fat, and therefore belly fat as a result.  You can customize a workout by putting as many as 6 segments (with 1 repeat segment) into any order you choose.  The ""Dancer's Silhouette"" segment isn't really cardio, it's more overall toning. The music choice is great, and Petra is encouraging and fun, as always.  The cueing is adequate.  There are very brief warm ups and cool downs with each segment.  My complaint with this DVD is that I don't like my cardio broken into short segments. I feel like it's hard to keep my heart rate up; that's why I gave this DVD 4 stars instead of 5.  However, I know that's the point of the 10 Minute Solutions DVDs and I don't own any other 10 Minute Solution DVDs for this reason.  I bought this one strictly because I am a big fan of Petra Kolber.Several reviewers complained about the lack of instruction.  However, with the segments being only 10 minutes long, I don't know how there is time have every move broken down at half-time.  Petra would never make it through more than 3 moves in 10 minutes.  There are times when Petra breaks the moves down at half-time, for moves that are a  little more challenging.  I don't think this DVD is very difficult.  If you can do box steps, mambos, pony steps and a kick, ball change, you can do this DVD.  As with all excercise DVDs, the first time I try the DVD, I falter; but with successive attempts, the DVD gets easier.  There are no complicated turns, and the one time Petra introduces a turn, she says you don't have to do it.I do prefer Petra Kolber's 3-2-1 Dance [ASIN:B0010QH1GE 3 2 1 Dance]].  If you really like dance DVDs, without the short segments, I highly recommend 3-2-1 Dance.",4,Enjoyable,1246665600,"07 4, 2009",2009,2018,"['counter', 'claims', 'other', 'reviewers', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'DVD', 'billed', 'DVD', '5', '10', 'minute', 'segments', 'supposedly', 'designed', 'work', 'abs', 'concentrate', 'extremely', 'hard', 'abs', 'entire', 'time', 'work', 'out', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'abs', 'DVD', 'probably', 'designed', 'decreased', 'body', 'fat', 'therefore', 'belly', 'fat', 'result', 'can', 'customize', 'workout', 'putting', 'as', 'many', '6', 'segments', '1', 'repeat', 'segment', 'order', 'choose', 'Dancer', 'Silhouette', 'segment', ""n't"", 'really', 'cardio', 'more', 'overall', 'toning', 'music', 'choice', 'great', 'Petra', 'encouraging', 'fun', 'always', 'cueing', 'adequate', 'are', 'very', 'brief', 'warm', 'ups', 'cool', 'downs', 'segment', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cardio', 'broken', 'short', 'segments', 'feel', 'hard', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'why', 'gave', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'However', 'know', 'point', '10', 'Minute', 'Solutions', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'other', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'DVDs', 'reason', 'bought', 'one', 'strictly', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Petra', 'Kolber.Several', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'lack', 'instruction', 'However', 'segments', 'being', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'time', 'have', 'move', 'broken', 'down', 'half-time', 'Petra', 'would', 'never', 'make', 'more', '3', 'moves', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Petra', 'moves', 'down', 'half-time', 'moves', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'challenging', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'DVD', 'very', 'difficult', 'can', 'do', 'box', 'steps', 'mambos', 'pony', 'steps', 'kick', 'ball', 'change', 'can', 'do', 'DVD', 'excercise', 'DVDs', 'first', 'time', 'try', 'DVD', 'falter', 'successive', 'attempts', 'DVD', 'easier', 'are', 'complicated', 'turns', 'one', 'time', 'Petra', 'turn', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'it.I', 'do', 'prefer', 'Petra', 'Kolber', '3-2-1', 'Dance', '[', 'ASIN', 'B0010QH1GE', '3', '2', '1', 'Dance', ']', ']', 'really', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'short', 'segments', 'highly', 'recommend', '3-2-1', 'Dance']",10 Minute Solution: Dance Off Belly Fat
1232074,A1K2EM1HZ2IE68,B001QU882A,"tinkerbell0023 ""tinkerbell0023""","[0, 0]","Ok, this is a tough dance DVD. I've done other 10 min solution dance DVD's and almost everything that Jennifer Galardi has put out there (thank goodness!). Part of the problem with this DVD is the order that the 10 minute sections are in. The last one starts off with a warm up, and the one before she mentions ""You're going to be seeing a lot of these today"". The second one is much slower paced and easy. I think the best order to do this DVD in is 5, 4, 3, 1, 2, because it's in the last segments that she introduces and explains some of the moves. If you start out with the first one on the DVD, she just jumps right in and it's pretty intimidating.Aside from the order being not so user-friendly, after you do it a few times, you'll get the hang of it. This is the nature of dance DVDs! Sometimes it is fun to do something that not only challenges you physically, but also mentally (like remembering routines). It's definitely not for a day when your nerves are already frazzled, but if you're up for learning some choreography, this is it. On another day when you just want to do exercises without having to remember a lot, do Biggest Loser or Lindsay Brin's Boot Camp. They are more of the ""do alternating lunges for a minute. Now do pushups for one minute"" type of workouts.",4,One tough cookie,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,1282,"['Ok', 'tough', 'dance', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'done', 'other', '10', 'min', 'solution', 'dance', 'DVD', 'almost', 'everything', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Part', 'problem', 'DVD', 'order', '10', 'minute', 'sections', 'are', 'last', 'one', 'warm', 'up', 'one', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'seeing', 'lot', 'today', 'second', 'one', 'much', 'slower', 'paced', 'easy', 'think', 'best', 'order', 'do', 'DVD', '5', '4', '3', '1', '2', 'last', 'segments', 'moves', 'start', 'out', 'first', 'one', 'DVD', 'just', 'jumps', 'right', 'pretty', 'intimidating.Aside', 'order', 'being', 'not', 'so', 'user-friendly', 'do', 'few', 'times', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hang', 'nature', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'Sometimes', 'fun', 'do', 'something', 'not', 'only', 'physically', 'also', 'mentally', 'remembering', 'routines', 'definitely', 'not', 'day', 'when', 'nerves', 'are', 'already', 'frazzled', ""'re"", 'up', 'learning', 'choreography', 'day', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'exercises', 'having', 'remember', 'lot', 'do', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'Lindsay', 'Brin', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'are', 'more', 'do', 'alternating', 'lunges', 'minute', 'Now', 'do', 'pushups', 'one', 'minute', 'type', 'workouts']",10 Minute Solution: Dance Off Belly Fat
