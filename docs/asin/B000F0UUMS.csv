981062,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000F0UUMS,A Customer,"[7, 8]","Part nostalgia trip and part sociopolitical documentary, Joseph Lovett's remarkable film Gay Sex in the 70's gives us an astonishing piece of history. So much time has actually passed, yet as this movie attests, the enthusiasm for those halcyon days is infused with a certain sense of regret.Tracing the gay movement from the Stonewall riots, through the permissive seventies to 1981 when the era ended with the onslaught of AIDS, Gay Sex in the 70's shows the glories and perils of anonymous gay sex during the one decade when people didn't feel guilty about doing it.Incorporating some spectacular archival footage, the era is also recounted by a handful of older, sophisticated gay men including Rodger McFarlane, photographer Tom Bianchi, writer Larry Kramer, artist Barton Benes, and English professor and writer Arnie Kantrowitz, who offer considerate, articulate - and sometimes even volatile - remembrances of their indiscretions amid the Manhattan and Fire Island gay scene.The sex happened absolutely everywhere - the West Side piers and in bathhouses, abandoned buildings, the backs of bars, and the darkened carriages of trucks. Scores of archival surveillance-like photographs are provided of men spied through windows and doors having sex with each other.  Sex was on the brain, while the men, caught up in lusty expectation were mostly on their elbows and backs.Gay men sought out each other in the streets, bars, baths, on derelict piers, truck-loading docks, in parks and discos of Manhattan, including the famous studio 54. All you'd have to do was smile at another man on the street and then it would be on - you could have a quick session with someone at lunch before you went on to your afternoon orgy.The film does a good job of explaining how this newfound libertinism was a backlash against years of repression and shame. While in other parts of the United States  - and indeed the western world - gay men were criminalized, ostracized, and institutionalized. New York City was a sanctuary and a haven for gay men to find themselves and others like them.But of course nothing comes without risk. Little did these men - most of whom are portrayed as muscled and masculine gods - know that something seditious was lurking just around the corner in those back rooms and dark alcoves.The interviewees acknowledge that drugs and sexually transmitted diseases were taking their toll before the outbreak of AIDS, yet the use of condoms was spurned and the notion of safe sex was seen as an insult to these newfound sexual freedoms.The film certainly evokes a rich sense of the dawning of gay liberation. Is there's such a thing as too much freedom? Maybe, maybe not, there are however, many lessons to be learned that perhaps indulging in such extreme bacchanalian behaviour is indeed liberating and freedom inducing, yet there is ultimately a price to be paid for doing it in the form of your health and your life.

It is a fascinating social document of a much persecuted population.  It shouldn't be difficult for straight men to empathize with their gay brothers who sought anonymous sex in such dicey locations as the rickety New York docks, where some amorous adventurers actually fell to their deaths through the decaying boards.  Just imagine if there were hundreds of beautiful, willing women just waiting for whoever came along in the dark.  If you don't think that straight men would flock there by the hundreds, you're living in a fantasy world.  If you think they would, then you should have no trouble understanding the men in this film.

The documentary was produced by former ABC Producer (20/20)Joseph Lovett. Gay Sex in the 70s is an excellent film.The film primarily focuses on the disco era. Various gay men describe their lives and how things happened during that era. There is also a great deal of archived footage incorporated into the film. From back rooms at clubs to wild scenes in semi trucks at the docks things were definitely wild and free during that era.Gay Sex in the 70s is a great historical film. The saddest part of the film is when the early 1980's are discussed. The dawn of the AIDS era really impacted the gay community in a major way. One man shows a pile of pictures of all of his friends who died from the disease. Another man tells a story about how one of his patients called him when he was hospitalized for what he was told was a strange cancer. One great thing the film captured is how the gay community really took a handle of things and worked hard to promote awareness about the disease before the government or any other group got involved.Gay Sex in the 70s is a film I highly recommend to historians and people interested in gay/lesbian culture.I for one am someone who knew nothing about this era, so I found this film very enlightning.",5,Recommended Documentary About 70s Gay Scene,1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,1365,"['documentary', 'Gay', 'Sex', '70s', 'examines', 'lifestyle', 'culture', 'gay', 'men', '1969', '1981', 'dawn', 'AIDS', 'era', 'documentary', 'was', 'produced', 'former', 'ABC', 'Producer', '20/20', 'Joseph', 'Lovett', 'Gay', 'Sex', '70s', 'excellent', 'film.The', 'film', 'primarily', 'disco', 'era', 'Various', 'gay', 'men', 'describe', 'lives', 'how', 'things', 'happened', 'era', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'archived', 'footage', 'incorporated', 'film', 'back', 'rooms', 'clubs', 'wild', 'scenes', 'semi', 'trucks', 'docks', 'things', 'were', 'definitely', 'wild', 'free', 'era.Gay', 'Sex', '70s', 'great', 'historical', 'film', 'saddest', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'early', '1980', 'are', 'discussed', 'dawn', 'AIDS', 'era', 'really', 'impacted', 'gay', 'community', 'major', 'way', 'One', 'man', 'pile', 'pictures', 'friends', 'who', 'died', 'disease', 'man', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'patients', 'called', 'when', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'what', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'strange', 'cancer', 'One', 'great', 'thing', 'film', 'captured', 'how', 'gay', 'community', 'really', 'took', 'handle', 'things', 'worked', 'hard', 'promote', 'awareness', 'disease', 'government', 'other', 'group', 'got', 'involved.Gay', 'Sex', '70s', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'historians', 'people', 'interested', 'gay/lesbian', 'culture.I', 'one', 'am', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'nothing', 'era', 'found', 'film', 'very', 'enlightning']",N/A

Yea, everybody is [...] and [...] and [...] nonstop, butt hearing about it over and over chafed me kinda raw. I wanted the film to penetrate deeper into the story. Instead it just poked around the rim.

(Nothing about AIDS is DIVINE!!)But the gay community rallied, educated itself, and thanks to the strugglesand sacrifices of people like the late Harvey Milk and others, realized thatthey had a political voice as well!So there was much good that came from those very bad times.But I liked that this film shows the pioneer group, the first generationof liberated gay men who stepped out there, wild & free, and the doors thathad kept them oppressed in the closet were knocked down forever!The younger generations of gay men and women are left to digest and discussthese lessons and to use what they learn as it applies to their day and time.This is good viewing for a young, entitled & frivolous gay community whichpretty much knows nothing of the struggles and gains of the past as they facediscrimination (Prop 8, The Struggle For Legal Acknowledgement of Same-Sex Marriage,Enactment of Hate Crime Laws For Protection Under The Law, etc.) in today's world!Even though much has been gained, the lessons of the past can educate andstrengthen you in your resolve to fight today, if you just pay attention.",5,Those Were The Days Of Our Lives!!,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,3230,"['being', 'raunchy', 'taking', 'chance', 'not', 'getting', 'review', 'published', 'will', 'say', 'documentary', 'good', 'chronicle', 'innocence', 'wildness', 'decadence', 'recklessness', 'gay', 'community', ""1970's.After"", 'Stonewall', 'Riots', '1969', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'U.S.decided', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'beaten', 'up', 'pushed', 'mistreatedanymore', '-They', 'decided', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'live', 'lives', 'closetanymore', 'nothing', 'was', 'wrong', 'were', 'beautiful', 'decent', 'well', 'were', 'going', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'personalities', 'andeffect', 'change', 'laws', 'country', 'loved', 'paid', 'taxes', 'live', 'Out', 'general', 'constructive', 'ethos', 'came', 'gay', 'rennaisance', '1970', 'was', 'very', 'magical', 'innocent', 'wild', 'frightening', 'time', 'once', 'here', 'are', 'survivors', 'who', 'lived', 'breathed', 'snorted', 'IT', 'scale', 'hedonism', 'not', 'seen', 'ancient', 'roman', 'greek', 'times', 'stories', 'are', 'racey', 'raunchy', 'archival', 'footage', 'raceyin', 'places', 'poppers', 'weed', 'coke', 'are', 'prevalent', 'how', 'theyrolled', '70', 'parties', 'infamous', 'baths', 'various', 'clubs', 'different', 'scenes', 'different', 'tastes', 'gay', 'men', 'openess', 'freeness', 'recklessness', 'piers', 'thetrucks', 'old', 'meat-packing', 'pun', 'intended', 'district', 'drug', 'chic', 'seeming', 'never-neverland', 'Fire', 'Island', 'ultimately', 'heavy', 'toll', 'perhaps', 'wild', 'free', 'debaucherous', 'living', 'took', 'early', '80', 'when', 'new', 'horrible', 'mysterious', 'gay', 'cancer', 'started', 'wipe', 'out', 'gay', 'menin', 'droves', 'shut', 'door', 'forever', 'summer', 'party', 'boys', 'fantasy', 'forever', 'Well', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'same', 'community', 'got', 'sober', 'woke', 'up', 'andstarted', 'fight', 'back', 'ravages', 'disease', '1985', 'had', 'name', 'AIDS', 'many', 'were', 'lost', 'early', 'days', 'when', 'nothing', 'wasknown', 'drugs', 'were', 'limited', 'fear', 'was', 'high', 'Many', 'saw', 'divine', 'judgement', 'gay', 'men', 'what', 'deemedas', 'unsavory', 'immoral', 'lifestyle', 'Nothing', 'AIDS', 'DIVINE', 'gay', 'community', 'rallied', 'educated', 'thanks', 'strugglesand', 'sacrifices', 'people', 'late', 'Harvey', 'Milk', 'others', 'realized', 'thatthey', 'had', 'political', 'voice', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'was', 'much', 'good', 'came', 'very', 'bad', 'times.But', 'liked', 'film', 'pioneer', 'group', 'first', 'generationof', 'liberated', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'stepped', 'there', 'wild', 'free', 'doors', 'thathad', 'kept', 'oppressed', 'closet', 'were', 'knocked', 'down', 'forever', 'younger', 'generations', 'gay', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'left', 'digest', 'discussthese', 'lessons', 'use', 'what', 'learn', 'day', 'time.This', 'good', 'viewing', 'young', 'entitled', 'frivolous', 'gay', 'community', 'whichpretty', 'much', 'knows', 'nothing', 'struggles', 'gains', 'past', 'facediscrimination', 'Prop', '8', 'Struggle', 'Legal', 'Acknowledgement', 'Same-Sex', 'Marriage', 'Enactment', 'Hate', 'Crime', 'Laws', 'Protection', 'Law', 'etc', 'today', 'world', 'Even', 'much', 'been', 'gained', 'lessons', 'past', 'can', 'educate', 'andstrengthen', 'resolve', 'fight', 'today', 'just', 'pay', 'attention']",N/A

It was literally a time of great happiness and fun.This document, which includes much archival footage well as current rememberances by folks who were there, gives a guided tour of what could only be called Babylon.Narrowing its focus to NYC, and The Pines, it gives an up-close and personal look at men who lusted for other men and what a wonderland a world of 'Yes' could create.  The tone shifts, because even though the name of the documentary is Gay Sex in the 70's, it takes you through the '80's and the advent of the AIDS pandemic.It helps explain the mindset of those men trapped in the opening wave of deaths.  AIDS had literally infected (and in effect killed) a huge percentage of the gay men in NYC before the first syptom appeared.It also discusses some of the hollowness of that age; the rampant drug abuse and mind-boggling disregard for personal safety that accompanied so much of 'the love that dare not speak its name' once it was shouting at the top of its lungs.  I am actually old enough to have participated in this, and knew many men who did.  They are all gone.  I am not, primarily because I was hiding from who and what I was.I literally hid until after AIDS hit, and by then, I was too careful to ever put myself in harms way.  This movie tries to help the modern viewer see that these were intelligent, albiet driven, men.  They thought, as many folks do today, that medical science would cure whatever ailed them.

Eliot's ""The Wasteland"" are a nifty metaphorical device used by this surprisingly brief and innocuous documentary of a time when there were virtually no restrictions on what is normally repressed and taboo.  By interviewing some of the survivors, beginning with a subject who collects the photos of long-lost friends on broken shards, the filmmaker attempts to retrieve the days of Sodom (NYC in the film).  Were the fragments pieces of a puzzle, the film might have proven a more productive occupation of the viewer's time.  As it stands, the movie is little more than what most viewers probably already remember or know.  Those who weren't there will find more graphic accounts in the contemporaneous articles and advertisements of, for example, ""The Village Voice.""I recall a day in 1979 when a protest against the making of a William Friedkin (""The Exorcist"") film starring Al Pacino (""Cruisin'"") caused enough of a stir to disrupt classes at NYU.  Even at the time, it wasn't clear to me what was so offensive about the movie--it was scripted in such a way as to make Pacino, an undercover, ""straight"" cop assigned to find a murderer by infiltrating the gay meeting places--the bars, the baths, the theaters, the piers, the trucks, the abandoned riverfront buildings--ultimately question his own assumptions about his own sexual identity.  Supposedly, the gay community was upset because the film would promote stereotypes.  The recollections of those interviewed for this movie merely confirm the foundation for such fears.Perhaps what sets this film apart from others is its unwillingness to mourn or moralize. Little is made of the numerous casualties of the nemesis that decimated the citizens of Sodom after 1980.  Instead, the film focuses on a few of the more educated, thoughtful survivors (including an English professor), who express both regret for the end of the bacchanal as well as awareness of the steep price of excess.  The interviewees make some weak attempts to rationalize the party (the inevitable outcome of years of repression; the necessary purging preceding a discovery and acceptance of one's true identity).  But it's amateurish, overly-familiar psychologizing--too little too late.As any teacher of composition wearies of asking student writers over and over again: ""Where's your thesis?

He tracks gay life in New York from 1969 and the Stonewall riots, to 1981 and the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. It uses a mix of still photos, interviews and archive film from the era to tell the tale.It is said that this period was the most sexually liberating since the times of the Roman Empire and that certainly seemed to be the case. Absolutely everyone seemed to be having more sex than they could handle, at one time one of the commentators called it the `narcotic of sex'. It was a bit like the old advert for `Martini' - `anytime, anyplace, anywhere etc'. There are some heart felt pieces about the repression that was taking place before the change in attitude, and sadly a lot of that still exists like the religious cures for being gay and even then the use of electro shock therapy as well as medication. It was also classified as a deviant mental illness.We are taken on a tour of saunas, night clubs, back rooms, sub ways and the disused piers that used to line the Hudson. There were also the back of the `meat trucks', where you basically took a chance by entering (no pun intended) and as one guy says if you managed to leave with an orgasm and your wallet then you were doing fine.  We are given a taste of the politics, the drug use and the eventual wake up call that was AIDS. There are some genuinely touching moments when some of the participants talk about lost loved ones and we are not talking a few but way too many who were taken too soon.I genuinely liked this documentary, it is only 71 minutes long and I would have liked to have seen more footage of the era and more of the music too, but that is my choice, this never portrayed itself as a gay disco party after all. For anyone interested in gay history this is pretty much a must see. It is only limited to New York so may seem a bit parochial given the title; for lovers of period gay cinema, I can recommend `Taxi zum Klo'Taxi Zum Kloand `Nighthawks'Nighthawks / Strip Jack Naked [Blu-ray]both truly excellent.",4,`From Repression to Celebration',1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,2090,"['documentary', 'film', 'maker', 'Josephn', 'Lovett', 'actually', 'too', 'gay', 'life', 'New', 'York', '1969', 'Stonewall', 'riots', '1981', 'beginning', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'mix', 'still', 'photos', 'interviews', 'archive', 'film', 'era', 'tell', 'tale.It', 'said', 'period', 'was', 'most', 'sexually', 'liberating', 'times', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'be', 'case', 'Absolutely', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'having', 'more', 'sex', 'could', 'handle', 'one', 'time', 'one', 'commentators', 'called', 'narcotic', 'sex', 'was', 'bit', 'old', 'advert', 'Martini', 'anytime', 'anyplace', 'anywhere', 'etc', 'are', 'heart', 'felt', 'pieces', 'repression', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'change', 'attitude', 'sadly', 'lot', 'still', 'religious', 'cures', 'being', 'gay', 'even', 'then', 'use', 'electro', 'shock', 'therapy', 'as', 'well', 'medication', 'was', 'also', 'classified', 'deviant', 'mental', 'illness.We', 'are', 'taken', 'tour', 'saunas', 'night', 'clubs', 'back', 'rooms', 'sub', 'ways', 'disused', 'piers', 'used', 'line', 'Hudson', 'were', 'also', 'back', 'meat', 'trucks', 'where', 'basically', 'took', 'chance', 'entering', 'pun', 'intended', 'one', 'guy', 'managed', 'leave', 'orgasm', 'wallet', 'then', 'were', 'doing', 'fine', 'are', 'given', 'taste', 'politics', 'drug', 'use', 'eventual', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'was', 'AIDS', 'are', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments', 'when', 'participants', 'talk', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'not', 'talking', 'few', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'taken', 'too', 'soon.I', 'genuinely', 'liked', 'documentary', 'only', '71', 'minutes', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'footage', 'era', 'more', 'music', 'too', 'choice', 'never', 'portrayed', 'gay', 'disco', 'party', 'anyone', 'interested', 'gay', 'history', 'pretty', 'much', 'must', 'see', 'only', 'limited', 'New', 'York', 'so', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'parochial', 'given', 'title', 'lovers', 'period', 'gay', 'cinema', 'can', 'recommend', 'Taxi', 'zum', ""Klo'Taxi"", 'Zum', 'Kloand', ""Nighthawks'Nighthawks"", '/', 'Strip', 'Jack', 'Naked', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'truly', 'excellent']",N/A
