""Electric"" was the only descriptor one can implement to accurately define this partnership. Often I have shared this DVD with yet to be ballet artists that instantly are captivated with the completion of an electric circuit found with the novice Nureyev and the older established prima ballerina Fonteyn. Through the support of their personal photographer, Keith Money, the viewer is permitted some discrete inside information that adds reality to their true characters. Within this recording is a rare piece of filmed ""Camilla"" as well as their arrests in the California. True hearts of the sixties was the magic found between this extraordinary dance couple.Within any partnership one leads while the other follows. Within a workable partnership the leader alters to follower when the occasion arises for no one is consistently correct. Please take the time to discover such partnerships in novel form.

Margot Fonteyn, the lady of the dance world, and Nureyev, a maverick, formed such a pair and complemented each other so well and this is clear from watching this footage.  Both gained much from the partnership, Fonteyn becoming more bold and passionate and Nureyev absorbing all of her proper schooling.  The dancing was wonderful but more importantly, the descriptions of how they worked together to become a dance couple of the highest attainable quality make this a worthwhile addition to any dance library.",5,Andromeda,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,616,"['Once', 'again', 'refreshing', 'see', 'such', 'videos', 'are', 'important', 'historical', 'accounts', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'lady', 'dance', 'world', 'Nureyev', 'maverick', 'formed', 'pair', 'complemented', 'other', 'so', 'well', 'clear', 'watching', 'footage', 'gained', 'much', 'partnership', 'Fonteyn', 'becoming', 'more', 'bold', 'passionate', 'Nureyev', 'absorbing', 'proper', 'schooling', 'dancing', 'was', 'wonderful', 'more', 'importantly', 'descriptions', 'how', 'worked', 'together', 'become', 'dance', 'couple', 'highest', 'attainable', 'quality', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'dance', 'library']",N/A

The most interesting ballet excerpts for me were ""Marguerite & Armand"" which I saw them dance at the Met in NY in the 1970s, and which renewed a beautiful memory of their tremendous acting abilities in those roles; and ""Romeo & Juliet"" which also emphasized their romantic partnership to full advantage.  ""Birthday Offering"" is briefly shown, both in amusing rehearsal with choreographer Frederick Ashton and after the performance (Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell, the second famous Royal Ballet partnership of the 70s, are briefly seen on the receiving line next to them), also ""Le Corsaire"" which was such a great showcase for Nureyev's leaps and bounds, and the ethereal ""Les Sylphides.""

Fonteyn and Nureyev were extraordinary in their dynamic dancing, with fire, energy and virility coming through on the part of Nureyev.  I for one am very glad that Nureyev defected from Russia while on tour in France.  Otherwise, many of us would never have the opportunity to witness and enjoy his incredible dancing abilities.  His grace, presentation and leaps leave me breathless and in awe.  The commentaries by people from the world of ballet are very interesting and informative.  A wonderful addition to anyone's music library, not just for the beauty of the ballet, but for the history of their work together in a ballet partnership to be long remembered.",5,Fascinating and riveting!,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,791,"['What', 'treasure', 'fascinating', 'history', 'incredible', 'dancing', 'careers', 'two', 'biggest', 'stars', 'world', 'ballet', 'Fonteyn', 'Nureyev', 'were', 'extraordinary', 'dynamic', 'dancing', 'fire', 'energy', 'virility', 'coming', 'part', 'Nureyev', 'one', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'Nureyev', 'defected', 'Russia', 'tour', 'France', 'Otherwise', 'many', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'opportunity', 'witness', 'enjoy', 'incredible', 'dancing', 'abilities', 'grace', 'presentation', 'leaps', 'leave', 'breathless', 'awe', 'commentaries', 'people', 'world', 'ballet', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'informative', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'anyone', 'music', 'library', 'not', 'just', 'beauty', 'ballet', 'history', 'work', 'together', 'ballet', 'partnership', 'be', 'long', 'remembered']",N/A

198004,A1KCZV9PDD5FF,6300175065,Theodore G. Mihran,"[49, 49]","I started following Rudolf Nureyev's career early in the 60's when I first saw him on a half-hour TV series (was it the Bell Telephone Hour?  Does anybody remember?).  I remember being stopped in my tracks as he projected  his balletic magic even over my tiny TV.  Then when I saw him dance  &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with the Royal Ballet, partnered with Margo  Fonteyn, it was the high point of my ballet watching.  I saw the movie four  times, and in this video, the two most memorable scenes are repeated: the  balcony scene, and the scene in the tomb in which Romeo dances with the  seemingly-lifeless Juliet.Margot Fonteyn (note that she gets top  billing) is still my favorite ballerina, and Nureyev has always been, and  will always be, my favorite male performer.  They both project their  personalities into their performances: he, with magnificient  self-assuredness and astounding technique (especially in his younger days)  combined with an amazing partnering ability which focuses your attention on  the ballerina when it is her turn to display her talents.  When they dance  together on equal terms, as in the two scenes mentioned above, they project  the perfect image of two lovers who almost dare not believe that love is  happening to them.  Could it be a reflection of their actual  lives...?Their personal lives are fascinating in themselves: Nureyev  being born on a train in a desolate region of Russia and almost forcing  himself as an outsider into official balletic circles; and Fonteyn, the  &quot;ideal&quot; (in the sense that D. H. Lawrence uses the word, meaning  &quot;mental&quot;) accomplished dancer who. almost at the end of her  career, is revitalized and sensualized by dancing with Nureyev, who is half  her age.Interviews with many notables are given in this video as they  try to explain the magic of this ballet pair-of-the-century.  But nothing  can replace their actual gripping performances in &quot;Marguerite and  Armand&quot; and &quot;Le Corsaire&quot; which  are also presented in this  video.I would be very happy to hear from others who enjoy this video  as much as I have.",5,An emotional and awe-inspiring balletic pair of superstars!,931392000,"07 8, 1999",1999,2128,"['started', 'following', 'Rudolf', 'Nureyev', 'career', 'early', '60', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'half-hour', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'Bell', 'Telephone', 'Hour', 'Does', 'anybody', 'remember', 'remember', 'being', 'stopped', 'tracks', 'projected', 'balletic', 'magic', 'even', 'tiny', 'TV', 'Then', 'when', 'saw', 'dance', 'quot', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'quot', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'partnered', 'Margo', 'Fonteyn', 'was', 'high', 'point', 'ballet', 'watching', 'saw', 'movie', 'four', 'times', 'video', 'two', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'are', 'repeated', 'balcony', 'scene', 'scene', 'tomb', 'Romeo', 'seemingly-lifeless', 'Juliet.Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'note', 'top', 'billing', 'still', 'favorite', 'ballerina', 'Nureyev', 'always', 'been', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'male', 'performer', 'project', 'personalities', 'performances', 'magnificient', 'self-assuredness', 'astounding', 'technique', 'especially', 'younger', 'days', 'combined', 'amazing', 'partnering', 'ability', 'attention', 'ballerina', 'when', 'turn', 'display', 'talents', 'When', 'dance', 'together', 'equal', 'terms', 'two', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'project', 'perfect', 'image', 'two', 'lovers', 'who', 'almost', 'dare', 'not', 'believe', 'love', 'happening', 'Could', 'be', 'reflection', 'actual', 'lives', 'personal', 'lives', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Nureyev', 'being', 'born', 'train', 'desolate', 'region', 'Russia', 'almost', 'forcing', 'outsider', 'official', 'balletic', 'circles', 'Fonteyn', 'quot', 'ideal', 'quot', 'sense', 'D.', 'H.', 'Lawrence', 'word', 'meaning', 'quot', 'mental', 'quot', 'accomplished', 'dancer', 'who', 'almost', 'end', 'career', 'revitalized', 'sensualized', 'dancing', 'Nureyev', 'who', 'age.Interviews', 'many', 'notables', 'are', 'given', 'video', 'try', 'explain', 'magic', 'ballet', 'pair-of-the-century', 'nothing', 'can', 'replace', 'actual', 'gripping', 'performances', 'quot', 'Marguerite', 'Armand', 'quot', 'quot', 'Le', 'Corsaire', 'quot', 'are', 'also', 'presented', 'video.I', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'hear', 'others', 'who', 'enjoy', 'video', 'as', 'much', 'have']",N/A
