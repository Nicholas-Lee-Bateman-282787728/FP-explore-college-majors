1530920,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B007HOQ5GU,Brian Maitland,"[0, 0]","The acting is pretty good but the story is so dumb. A bunch of Sikhs feeling prejudice from whites decide to show they can play with the big boys in some local Toronto rec league decide to form their own Speedy Singhs team. The problem with the movie overall is it can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or not. Honestly, I found much of the humor lame. Even comedian Russell Peters just seems to be doing his schtick in this one.It has a Bend 'Em Like Beckham feel to it but whereas that movie hit all the notes, this one just seems a little too contrived. There's a gratuitous Rob ""Youngblood"" Lowe who goes from ex-washed up NHLer to Zamboni driver to Sikh team coach. Of course, his daughter (the smokin' cute Camilla Booth) falls for the star of the Speedy Singhs.Anyway, do I have to go on? You can guess the ending as it's the same as pretty every other sports movie. The stuff on Sikh culture is maybe interesting if you are not Sikh nor live in Canada but to us here it's like whoop-de-freakin'-do, they're Sikh. So what? we played hockey in the street with everyone and maybe life is different on the West Coast than the Centre of the Universe there in Taranna but I've never seen anyone stick a Sikh kid in goal and then proceed to shoot the hockey ball at his turbaned head as a joke. Who does that? What was the point of showing that in the movie?Ack, it's CBC so what do you expect. The weirdest thing is there are name Bollywood actors in this as well as a music video at the end that has Ludacris in it. Oh, yeah, and the Sikh hockey players meet rapper Drake also when they go clubbing in the movie. In other words it's a cast of thousands.The extra I enjoyed more as we got to know the actors and how the movie was put together. Now that was worth watching. This movie, on the other hand, is maybe a good TV movie at best.",3,twist your turban round this one,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,1841,"['acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'so', 'dumb', 'bunch', 'Sikhs', 'feeling', 'prejudice', 'whites', 'decide', 'show', 'can', 'play', 'big', 'boys', 'local', 'Toronto', 'rec', 'league', 'decide', 'form', 'own', 'Speedy', 'Singhs', 'team', 'problem', 'movie', 'overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'be', 'comedy', 'not', 'Honestly', 'found', 'much', 'humor', 'lame', 'Even', 'comedian', 'Russell', 'Peters', 'just', 'be', 'doing', 'schtick', 'one.It', 'Bend', ""'Em"", 'Beckham', 'feel', 'movie', 'hit', 'notes', 'one', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'contrived', 'gratuitous', 'Rob', 'Youngblood', 'Lowe', 'who', 'ex-washed', 'up', 'NHLer', 'Zamboni', 'driver', 'Sikh', 'team', 'coach', 'course', 'daughter', 'smokin', 'cute', 'Camilla', 'Booth', 'star', 'Speedy', 'Singhs.Anyway', 'do', 'have', 'go', 'can', 'guess', 'ending', 'same', 'pretty', 'other', 'sports', 'movie', 'stuff', 'Sikh', 'culture', 'maybe', 'interesting', 'are', 'not', 'Sikh', 'live', 'Canada', 'here', ""whoop-de-freakin'-do"", ""'re"", 'Sikh', 'So', 'what', 'played', 'hockey', 'street', 'everyone', 'maybe', 'life', 'different', 'West', 'Coast', 'Centre', 'Universe', 'Taranna', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'Sikh', 'kid', 'goal', 'then', 'proceed', 'shoot', 'hockey', 'ball', 'turbaned', 'head', 'joke', 'Who', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'showing', 'movie', 'Ack', 'CBC', 'so', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'weirdest', 'thing', 'are', 'name', 'Bollywood', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'video', 'end', 'Ludacris', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Sikh', 'hockey', 'players', 'meet', 'rapper', 'Drake', 'also', 'when', 'go', 'clubbing', 'movie', 'other', 'words', 'cast', 'thousands.The', 'extra', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'got', 'know', 'actors', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'Now', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'maybe', 'good', 'TV', 'movie', 'best']",N/A

The fun parts was the conflict with Father and son,The different culture issue, the relationship was in question to the end, the acting was good, and a few surprises along the way that cause to think some.The music score was truly excellent as was the music video at the end was very good. I don't care for rap however I did here, the dancing was very well done also. All in all it is fun, different and just a nice way to get away for 90 minutes. It wasn't meant to be a great movie, just different and fun and on that score it gets a 100.",5,A very different film yet the same also,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,685,"['actually', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Yes', 'was', 'typical', 'sports', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'more', 'B', 'movie', 'Lowe', 'starting', 'out', 'fun', 'parts', 'was', 'conflict', 'Father', 'son', 'different', 'culture', 'issue', 'relationship', 'was', 'question', 'end', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'few', 'surprises', 'way', 'cause', 'think', 'some.The', 'music', 'score', 'was', 'truly', 'excellent', 'was', 'music', 'video', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'rap', 'however', 'did', 'here', 'dancing', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'fun', 'different', 'just', 'nice', 'way', 'get', 'away', '90', 'minutes', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'different', 'fun', 'score', '100']",N/A
