""Death at a Funeral"" is poor imitation of its predecessor.  Many in the cinema where I saw this film roared with laughter.  I was left somewhat cold.Although a very British comedy, ""Death at a Funeral"" simply fails to deliver.  The essence of the story is the death of a man of about seventy whose funeral is being held in the family home.  An eclectic group of mourners arrive including a lawyer off his face with acid, a dwarf gay lover and other assorted family eccentrics.  Their various mishaps did sometimes cause a wry smile but, overall, the humour was laboured.  British humour has much to offer.  It is typically far more subtle than its American counterpart which tends to rely too much on the obvious.  Yet, somehow, this film just failed to deliver.Perhaps, I'm just a party pooper?

Oz revels in madcap comedy and things do get outlandishly funny and absurd here, especially when Peter Dinklage quietly enters the movie.  He's brilliant here.  I see there's a US-based remake on the way (god knows why - it won't top the original) and the role of Peter Dinklage will be played by...Peter Dinklage.  Like anyone who's seen Oz's production, it's impossible to believe anyone but Dinklage could play the role. He's a terrific actor.The other standout here: Alan Tudyk.  He inadvertently ingests a hallucinogen early in the film, and then spends the next 90 minutes in an increasingly freaked-out state.  He breaks up the funeral with his insistence that there's someone live inside the casket.  That paranoia is hilariously rewarded later in the film.  It's a wonderful acting job by a man born in El Paso and raised in Plano, Texas.  Could have fooled me, Alan!Two other standouts:  the adorable and talented Daisy Donovan; and zany Kris Marshall (thinkLove Actually (Widescreen Edition)and Milwaukee!).

1131528,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0011KQSZ4,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[29, 33]","The great thing about DEATH AT A FUNERAL is that there really is something for everyone. From brief bathroom humor to dark jokes, it's all there, laid out by UK-born director Frank Oz.The title itself is a bit misleading, in that you would think it to be more horror-ish or dramatic. The words ""Death"" and ""Funeral"" don't normally make you skip to the theater thinking ""Oh boy! Let's go watch this funny movie!"" For that, I would fault only the production person who stamped the name on it. But that would be my only one; one which has nothing to do with the rest of this riotously funny film.Like a snake creeping upon its prey, Death at a Funeral also slowly makes its way along, never lurching or jumping ahead of itself, building the comedic moments one upon the other. Starting out (as all the trailers have shown) with Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) standing in his livingroom, watching his father's coffin being delivered in preparation for a British homestyle service. But once the coffin is open, Daniel states, ""That's not my father."" The funeral home quickly whisks away the casket and returns with the right one. This gradual sinking in of dark comedy holds the film together exceptionally well.We're then introduced to the rest of the cast...Jane (Keeley Hawes,Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story), Daniel's wife who's pressuring him to buy a flat in the city and leave his now widowed mother with his successful brother in New York.Simon (Alan Tudyk,Serenity), who is arriving at the funeral with his soon-to-be wife and is stressed about meeting (again) his future father-in-law, so is accidentally given a pill thought to be valium but, in reality, turns out to be a powerful hallucinogenic. This sends Simon on a running joke throughout the film, including periods of catatonia, color fascinations, and rooftop nudity.Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan,KISS KISS BANG BANG), a crotchety old fart who's brought to the funeral in a wheelchair only to find himself with explosively needy bowels and the witness to a possible murder.Peter (Peter Dinklage), a midget-of-a-man with big life aspirations who comes to the funeral not only to mourn the death of a close ""friend,"" but to also get what ""he deserves"" from the family.There are other perpetrators in the film, too, but these are the main ones who's paths cross just about everyone else's.The film's short 90 minute run time is excellent in that none of the funnies are overdone.

B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","Death at a Funeral, directed by Frank Oz, is a well made entertaining comedy, even if it about the odd circumstances around a family funeral. The film is about a funeral of a senior member of a wacky family. The comedy is full of misunderstandings, mistaken identities, slap-stick, and odd twists of fate.  The cast is excellent. Playing the role of one of the sons of the deceased, Matthew MacFadyen, is the anchor for the entire movie. He is the son whom everyone depends upon and thus when things start to fall apart at the funeral, it is to this son that everyone looks for help. A second playboy brother, played by Rupert Graves, is soon involved in the plot twists. A mysterious visitor to the funeral, played by Peter Dinklage elevates the mishaps and intrigue. Probably the most unique performance is that of Alan Tudyk, who mistakes a hallucinogen for valium and provides some of the most unusual scenes in the film, including climbing on the roof while nude.

1131536,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0011KQSZ4,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","You know those madcap comedy films in which absolutely everything goes wrong and chaos ensues? That's pretty much what you'll get from Frank Oz's ""Death at a Funeral,"" an over the top yet effective British farce that--if I may be allowed a ridiculous and overused saying--puts the ""fun"" in ""funeral."" Indeed, this is a funny movie, a creative blend of dry satire and physical humor that amounts to an interesting (if a little overplayed) character study. And that's how it should be, especially if the story involves a crazy family gathering for a funeral. The major characters are dysfunctional to a frightening degree: brothers squabble over each other's lives; cousins are neurotic and unable to say the right things; boyfriends are despised; old flames are futilely trying to reconnect. Just imagine all these people under the same roof.The comedy begins almost as soon as the film does. The grieving Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) awaits the arrival of his father's body. When the coffin arrives, he peers in for final identification. ""Who's that?"" he asks. ""That's not my father."" ""We brought the wrong one!"" one of the undertakers exclaims before they close the lid and rush off. A simple and somewhat predictable joke, no question. Yet it still has an agreeable charm. And it was clearly meant to serve as a framing device, signaling that what lies ahead for the characters will be far more chaotic, dangerous, nerve-wracking, and above all, humorous. I don't dare question the implausibility of this film; screwball comedies don't work on realistic levels simply because realism is not funny.So then what is funny when it comes to ""Death at a Funeral""? How about a man in a drug-induced delirium? This is exactly what happens to Simon (Alan Tudyk), the boyfriend of Martha (Daisy Donovan), the dead man's niece; mistaking a powerful hallucinogen for Valium, Simon takes a pill and spends the rest of the film ranting incoherently and seeing things that aren't really there. He believes that something is alive in the coffin because it's moving. He notes how green everything around him is. He unrolls toilet paper, telling the sheets to join the others. But his most erratic behavior shows up late in the film--and while I won't tell you what he does, I'm sure you have a good idea from the ads. Martha is understandably on edge; aside from her warped boyfriend, she also has to deal with a former lover, who won't leave her alone, and her father, who despises Simon for no apparent reason.Here's another funny scenario (and this is the film's most important subplot): a secret gay affair. Apparently, Daniel's father was not who he seemed. And this comes to light when an American dwarf named Peter (Peter Dinklage) introduces himself as the secret lover. In believing that he's entitled to something, Peter blackmails Daniel for 15,000 pounds. If Daniel doesn't pay up, Peter will expose the truth to the entire family. This is but one extra level of pressure Daniel is now under: for one thing, his writer brother, Robert (Rupert Graves), failed to pay for his half of the funeral; but more importantly, Daniel and his wife, Jane (Keeley Hawes), need a down payment for a flat away from his parents' home. Between the extra funeral expenses and the blackmail money, it doesn't look like he'll be going anywhere.Now imagine how much crazier this situation gets when Peter is tied up and gagged. The sheer insanity of this scene is actually more exhausting than funny; how many things need to go wrong before the film's sense of humor goes too far? I ask this because there's a fine, fine line between fun and pointlessness, and I'm not entirely sure that ""Death at a Funeral"" balances itself accordingly. Every joke is over the top, but some are more over the top than others, and they are the ones I end up questioning. Still, I did find myself giggling more than once at the intentional ridiculousness. More often than not, physical gags and four-letter dialogue are funny.Even the family drama between Daniel and Robert is a little funny, simply because their problems are so common as to seem relatable. Daniel is jealous that Robert has become a successful novelist; because of this, it's automatically assumed that he, not Daniel, will deliver the eulogy. Daniel is jealous enough to try writing his own novel (Peter reads some of the manuscript and says, ""I tried writing once; it didn't work out for me, either""). He's also annoyed that Robert ran off to New York, essentially deserting his family while spending a great deal of money. Doesn't such rivalry and tension seem all too familiar? Aren't there people like this in every family, siblings or otherwise? I don't think this subplot was meant to serve as a counterpoint to the comedy; rather, I think it adds a different level of comedy altogether, a level that can easily be understood.Such is the way with ""Death at a Funeral,"" a film that isn't afraid to use death as a way to make us laugh. There was once a Broadway musical called ""Dance of the Vampires,"" and it featured a song called ""Death is Such an Odd Thing""; I found myself thinking of that title as I watched ""Death at a Funeral,"" simply because the point it makes is true. And death gets even more odd when you consider the people who will go on living. Will they keep the dead person's memory alive? Will they remember the dead person fondly? Will they remember the dead person at all? Will they even go to the funeral? I ask this because I've never attended one. I only hope that when I do, death will seem less odd and more dignified.",4,"Ashes to Ashes, Laughter to Laughter",1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,5572,"['know', 'madcap', 'comedy', 'films',

First, let me emphasize that THIS version; the 2007 British cast is far superior to the 2010 remake with Chris Rock.  While the 2010 remake has an identical storyline and identical character types, the humor and fun of the story - which is played out identically in the British version - is completely lost to poor acting and weak characters in the remake.  The remake has all of the substance of the British original, but none of the charm or style.  Stick with the 2007 British original; the funniest and most endearing comedy in years.  Secondly, I want to point out the wonderful appeal of Peter Dinklage - who plays the same character in both versions - and his enormous talent, which - for me - is the highlight of both versions.

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","2007's ""Death at a Funeral"" is very British humor, a series of sight gags and slow rolling social catastrophies that threaten to overwhelm one dysfunctional family's valiant attempt to conduct a dignified funeral service. An outstanding cast stiff-upper-lips its way through this short and tightly paced comedy.As the story opens, dutiful son Daniel (Matthew MacFadyen) and his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes) host the funeral service for Daniel's father at their country home.  As relatives and friends gather for the service, things begin to go wrong.  The funeral home delivers the wrong body to the service.  Simon (Alan Tudyk), the fiance of Daniel's cousin Martha (Daisy Donovan) accidentally ingests an hallucinatory drug and slowly but hilariously proceeds to come unglued during the ceremony.  Martha's brother (Kris Marshall) who made up the drug, spends the movie trying to retrieve the medicine bottle when he isn't helping to move an inconveniently dead body.  Another cousin, Howard (Andy Nyman), gets stuck with the care of cantankerous Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughn), leading to a disasterous incident of scatological humor.  A friend (Peter Dinklage) of the dead father turns out to be a blackmailer, who must somehow be kept from disrupting the service.  Sundry other family members decide the funeral service is the right time to air family laundry.  Daniel and his estranged brother Robert (Rupert Graves) deadpan their way through the middle of the chaos, trying to sort out their relationship while keep the service on schedule.  The much put-upon Daniel will assert himself at the end to retrieve what little dignity remains in the ceremony, revealing MacFadyen to have a subtle sense of comic timing.This movie earns its R rating with strong language, some nudity, and drug use.  With those cautions given, this is one funny movie, highly recommended to those addicted to its very British humor.

A very talented actor, with 104 film appearances on his resume -he also specialized in ""voice work"". He and Jim Henson created the whole MUPPETS phenomenon. He created multiple characters, the most famous of which were Kermit and Miss Piggy. He is equally well known for being the voice of Yoda for the George Lucas STAR WARS series. As a director he has made 14 films, varying from THE DARK CRYSTAL (1982), through the classic fun of WHAT ABOUT BOB? (1991). All the way across the spectrum to the crime thriller, THE SCORE (2001), with Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, and Marlon Brando. DEATH AT A FUNERAL (2007) represents his triumphant return to comedy; and what a dark and delicious foray it is.A farce of the first order, this film is about a normally dysfunctional family who are forced to confront each other at a patriarch's funeral. The amazing script was written by Dean Craig. He is a young writer/director with only four films to his credit. In 2003 he gave us DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS. His script for FUNERAL was filled with wafts, even wads of wit, had terrific internal timing, a solid structure and plot, with a delectable and irreverent sense of humor. It is a film so completely farcical that I believe it could be produced on stage, in live theatre. All those slamming doors, crossed-over plotlines, and zany characters would lend themselves to some outrageous theatrical moments.Attending the film I was happy to give in to the instant giddiness that most of the audience immediately lapsed into -beginning to titter and then guffaw while the opening credits were still rolling.

1131552,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0011KQSZ4,Grady Harp,"[38, 42]","Like so many others this viewer avoided the theatrical release and deferred to the DVD release of DEATH AT A FUNERAL, thinking that a comic take on a potentially morbid subject might not be very entertaining.  Couldn't have been more wrong!  This is the kind of humor the Brits do so well - intelligent, expertly delivered dialog and action that can make even the most unlikely situations hilarious.  Writer Dean Craig and Director Frank Oz have created a farce and have put this tongue in cheek situation in the hands of some the best of the British actors.  The result is a spinning top that only gradually allows the viewer to breathe from laughing during the clever final credits.The father of a very dysfunctional family has died and son Daniel (Matthew MacFadyen) and his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes) have agreed to host the funeral. After the mortuary first delivers the wrong corpse the tone is set for all the wrong things to happen.  The arriving family is a bizarre clan of characters - a novelist living beyond his means in New York (Rupert Graves), a man who unwittingly mistakes an hallucinogen for Valium and ends up on a trip that entertains all, a 'drug distributor', a crotchety old man with toilet problems, and the usual stuffy and goofy associates that so often populate the British comedies. And when it seems as though little else could support sanity, up pops a figure form the US (Peter Dinklage) with a secret about the deceased and proceeds to cause a situation that becomes the focal point of this zany funeral.Saying too much about each of the characters diminishes the surprises that abound. Were it not for the fact that each of the actors in the film is 'top drawer' this little movie could have become mawkish or tasteless, but this cast and director have produced one of the most refreshingly funny films of the past year.

1131553,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0011KQSZ4,Haunted Flower,"[2, 2]","1 Disc Widescreen Edition (2007)The original ""Death at a Funeral"" was directed by Frank Oz and written by Dean Craig. This story has the feel of a great play where an ensemble cast of ridiculous Brits try to make the best of a bad situation at their patriarch's funeral when many things go awry and a midget attempts to blackmail them.This is a zany farce for certain. There are many familiar British faces and the situations just go from bad to worse and from worse to horrifyingly funny. A comedy of manners combined with pure slapstick in a funeral that seems unable to be completed between fighting and public nudity and mixed up corpses. There's a great build in exposition in the first act, an increase in action in the second, and then all out looney by the third with nice closure. It really reminds me of a great ensemble farce play like ""Noises Off"" that was made into a movie in 1992 featuring Michael Caine, Carol Burnett, and Christopher Reeve (but I recommend seeing that live if you can because it's a lot funnier that way).The best stand-out performance is by Alan Tudyk whom you might remember as the pirate in ""Dodgeball"" and he plays Simon. His English accent is wonderful, so convincing that I didn't know he was actually American till I listened to the commentary. His character is trying really hard to impress his girlfriend's father and is so nervous going to this funeral that he takes Valium to calm down.Unfortunately, it is not Valium but a hallucinogenic drug and he spends the entire day getting progressively more spaced out and behaving ridiculously until he ends up naked on the roof! His facial expressions are so well done that you can almost imagine what his character is seeing when he is staring at the widow's hat. He does lots of great little bits ranging from subtle to very intense and it sells the situation really well.Matthew Macfadyen plays Daniel, the responsible brother who stayed home and took care of their father before he passed. He is trying so hard to stay respectful and calm throughout the day and it's a big chore to be one of the few straight characters amongst a bunch of looneys including Peter Dinklage, the dwarf attempting to blackmail the family and Andy Nyman, an insecure hypochondriac care taking for Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan) while general screwing things up for the others with pettiness.It also has one of the English fellows from ""Love Actually"" Kris Marshall so a friend and I kept quoting back and forth whenever he came onscreen, ""You do not have a cute British accent!"" ""Yes I DO!"" There are many great characters and performances, but it's really the group working together that makes it work so well. A pure delight with lots of laughs and a bit of heart and I highly recommend seeing it BEFORE the remake version because from what I've seen of the trailer, they are using the same jokes almost word for word with an urban flair and if it doesn't work out well, I'd rather you see this one to begin with.DVD Extras:There is audio commentary with director Frank Oz. The director alone speaks a lot about how it was difficult to even out the weather over different scenes and how the indoor shoot and outdoor shoot were an hour away so someone running indoors really did the second part of the scene five weeks later. It is a love fest about the actors, but he really focuses on the talent of Peter Dinklage and his deliberate choice to only mention his height in dialogue once. It's a bit stiff but if you enjoy hearing about how many cameras were used in certain shots and why and how an actress' pregnancy was covered up, then by all means listen.There is also audio commentary with screenwriter Dean Craig and actors Alan Tudyk who played Simon and Andy Nyman who played Howard. Of the two commentaries, this is the more entertaining, mostly because it's a group of people chattering back and forth, two of whom are funny actors and the other being the source of the funny material for the film. Alan is American and talks about the joys of learning to drive sitting on the right side on the other side of the road. There is a lot of talk about how certain jokes came about and what was written and what was improvised on the day.He mentions one scene where he actually was high because he was experimenting for research for the role and didn't know he would be filming on that day. The difficulties of making it through certain scenes with a straight face and unconscious hand movements are explored in more depth and it's a pretty fun listen. It is also verified that yes, Alan was completely and utterly naked for the shoot and actually grew accustomed to it and bored after a while.The gag reel is very funny, lots of line flubs and inability to keep the crazy grin on or talk about the parking space without laughing. You get to see extended takes of Alan Tudyk's performance of being drugged out which are very funny as well. As with all gag reels, it clearly demonstrates how much fun the movie was to make and as a result, makes you feel included in the fun.",5,Death at a Funeral brings a lot of laughs,1270944000,"04 11,

Rooney,"[2, 2]","This is a very funny British movie, a fast-moving farce that includes a gay dwarf, a guy tripping on acid, the delivery of the wrong departed loved one, and a little too much unexpected viewing of a corpse. The actors do a superb job of conveying zaniness at an upper-crust country house funeral. The plot is based on human foibles and flaws, and there are no lessons to be learned or morals to be drawn.

There are lots of great ideas in this humorous ride, but which one is the point of the film?Where DEATH really excels as a work of art is in the truly smart and savvy editing;it is cut together magnificently and is worthy of mention alone.WARNING: If a review gives away the secret of the corpse, much of the fun and suspense will be diminished!Unfortunately I had read such one and it DID affect the punch this film could have had.Alan Tudyk really does steal the show with a comic turn as Simon, the mistakenly drug-induced lawyer.Matthew Macfadyen and Rupert Graves as the siblings do well enough as the foils in this farce, though I do prefer their dramatic work better.As always it is great to continue to see Peter Dinklage getting interesting parts in films, though to be a mere supporting character betrays his excellence as a lead dramatic actor.Still,all-in-all,DEATH AT A FUNERAL is a pleasing enough one-time view that does contain smart and witty repartee and enough laughs worth the time.Excellent companion films would be MAY FOOLS (French) and to some degree THE CELEBRATION (French) and THE SEA (Icelandic).",3,"Finding out secrets at a ""Funeral""",1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,2726,"['grandmother', 'died', '1992.It', 'was', 'first', 'funeral', 'had', 'ever', 'attended.A', 'very', 'different', 'portrait', 'woman', 'thought', 'knew', 'VERY', 'well', 'surfaced', 'most', 'unexpectedly', 'get-together', 'afterwards', 'Aunt', 'house.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'extremely', 'surprised', 'little', 'more', 'shocked', 'what', 'had', 'discovered', 'dear', 'old', 'Gaga', '.Hence', 'come', 'DEATH', 'AT', 'A', 'FUNERAL', 'ripping', 'good', 'time', 'movie', 'divided', 'British', 'family', 'attempt', 'send', 'off', 'dignified', 'manner', 'beloved', 'patriarch.What', 'would', 'normally', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'turns', 'total', 'chaos', 'involving', 'hallucinogenic', 'drugs', 'sibling', 'rivalries', 'romantic', 'jealousies', 'wacky', 'relatives', 'blackmail', 'murder', 'attempts', 'long', 'held', 'unknown', 'dark', 'secret', 'corpse.Director', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'have', 'returned', 'British', 'roots', 'DEATH', 'truly', 'first', 'rate', 'assemblage', 'NOW', 'actors', 'unfortunately', 'American', 'humor', 'simply', 'funereal', 'European', 'farce', 'reduced', 'gross-out', 'factor', 'order', 'secure', 'laugh', 'too', 'much', 'American', 'influence', 'crept', 'in.The', 'scatology', 'film', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'clever', 'wacky.That', 'though', 'not', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'Oz', 'know', 'when', 'one', 'joke', 'line', 'comedy', 'run', 'course', 'then', 'move', 'on.Much', 'dragged', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'order', 'continue', 'be', 'funny.The', 'film', 'necessary', 'focus', 'bring', 'full', 'circle.Is', 'point', 'film', 'secret', 'corpse', 'brother', 'rivalry', 'blackmail', 'attempt', 'ultimately', 'conclusion', 'eulogy', 'are', 'lots', 'great', 'ideas', 'humorous', 'ride', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Where', 'DEATH', 'really', 'work', 'art', 'truly', 'smart', 'savvy', 'editing', 'cut', 'together', 'magnificently', 'worthy', 'mention', 'alone.WARNING', 'review', 'away', 'secret', 'corpse', 'much', 'fun', 'suspense', 'will', 'be', 'diminished', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'read', 'such', 'one', 'DID', 'affect', 'punch', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had.Alan', 'Tudyk', 'really', 'steal', 'show', 'comic', 'turn', 'Simon', 'mistakenly', 'drug-induced', 'lawyer.Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'siblings', 'do', 'well', 'enough', 'foils', 'farce', 'do', 'prefer', 'dramatic', 'work', 'better.As', 'always', 'great', 'continue', 'see', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'getting', 'interesting', 'parts', 'films', 'be', 'mere', 'supporting', 'character', 'excellence', 'lead', 'dramatic', 'actor.Still', 'all-in-all', 'DEATH', 'AT', 'A', 'FUNERAL', 'pleasing', 'enough', 'one-time', 'view', 'contain', 'smart', 'witty', 'repartee', 'enough', 'laughs', 'time.Excellent', 'companion', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'MAY', 'FOOLS', 'French', 'degree', 'CELEBRATION', 'French', 'THE', 'SEA', 'Icelandic']",N/A

Dad definitely gets a send off but not quite the one they'd hoped for. With a crazy cast of relatives not all of whom get along; the wrong body; a famous brother and favorite son- whose only goal is chatting up a cute girl; a stray bottle of ""Valium"" that keeps turning up at inopportune times; a dwarf with a  big secret; and a coffin with a mind of its own- it's the recipe for disaster. The supporting cast are all people you will recognize but may not know their names. With a lesser cast this might have turned into a very different movie. But all of the players are top notch, blessed with  perfect timing and directed with a deft hand by Frank Oz. It reminds me a bit of Young Frankenstein.

1131584,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B0011KQSZ4,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 1]","I'm not sure what I would call DEATH AT A FUNERAL.  Comedy of errors?  Somewhat.  Screwball comedy?  A bit.  Dark comedy?  Certainly.  Drawing room comedy?  Part of it.  Farce?  Sure, why not?What do all of those things have in common?  Well, they're all supposed to be funny.So, is this movie funny?  Meh.  Humor is so subjective.  Why don't I tell you why it thinks it's funny, and you can decide for yourself if this is the kind of thing you might take to.Like many other films (and plays) of it's ilk, this movie tries to draw humor from a few tried and true sources.  First of all, it takes place in Britain, and it's a staple of many entertainments of this sort to take the starch out of the handful of indignant British elders gathered for what is normally a somber situation.  That, of course, is source #2; the irony of all the wacky inanity that happens around a (sometimes) closed coffin (one guy spends the entire funeral trying to score, a la Will Ferrel's character fromWedding Crashers).  You also have a great deal of scatological humor (most of it at the expense of a whiney hypochondriac) and a malcontented midget who is up to no good.  It's mildly amusing, although nothing to drop your monocle over.Part of what helps (and hurts) the film is that its cast is (at least to me) of relatively equal fame, and so they work quite well as an ensemble.  Unfortunately, it also means that (with one exception that I'll get to) there are no real standouts.  If you factor in the fairly tepid writing, you get a cast of characters that tend to blur into one another.  For instance, Daniel, the put-upon writer-wannabe who is in charge of the proceedings, clashes with his brother, Robert, a famous writer who is also irresponsible and vain.  Their conflict is engineered to keep them from devolving into caricatures of each other, which is exactly what happens when the conflict goes away 2/3rds of the way through the movie.  Daniel's wife, Jane, and Martha, the fiance of another guest (getting to him, getting to him), play the straight line to their troubled men and so they come across as being the exact same person (seriously -- their hair and clothing and even faces are almost identical).  The above mentioned hypochondriac fumbles and stumbles around with the same thinly disguised freneticism as another character: a hapless pharmacology student.Which brings me to Martha's fiance, Simon.  The pharmacology student happens to be toting some serious hallucinogens in a bottle labeled Valium and, of course, one of them ends up down Simon's throat.  Thus we have the wacky, unpredictable lunacy of Simon to contend with.  Played flawlessly by Alan Tudyk (Why doesn't this guy get more parts?  He's amazing!), this subplot effectively draws all the attention away from everything else that's supposed to be funny.  And although his story ends up being fairly predictable, it still steals enough of the show to make the rest of the movie feel achingly pedestrian.(Oh, and one more thing that bothered me: the title of the film?  Let's just say it's very, very misleading.)",3,Drug Overdoses and Other Hilarious Tomfoolery!,1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,3090,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'DEATH', 'AT', 'A', 'FUNERAL', 'Comedy', 'errors', 'Somewhat', 'Screwball', 'comedy', 'bit', 'Dark', 'comedy', 'Certainly', 'Drawing', 'room', 'comedy', 'Part', 'Farce', 'Sure', 'why', 'not', 'What', 'do', 'things', 'have', 'common', 'Well', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'funny.So', 'movie', 'funny', 'Meh', 'Humor', 'so', 'subjective', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why', 'funny', 'can', 'decide', 'kind', 'thing', 'might', 'take', 'to.Like', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'ilk', 'movie', 'draw', 'humor', 'few', 'tried', 'true', 'sources', 'First', 'all', 'place', 'Britain', 'staple', 'many', 'entertainments', 'sort', 'take', 'starch', 'handful', 'indignant', 'British', 'elders', 'gathered', 'what', 'normally', 'somber', 'situation', 'course', 'source', '2', 'irony', 'wacky', 'inanity', 'sometimes', 'closed', 'coffin', 'one', 'guy', 'entire', 'funeral', 'trying', 'score', 'la', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'character', 'fromWedding', 'Crashers', 'also', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'scatological', 'humor', 'most', 'expense', 'whiney', 'hypochondriac', 'malcontented', 'midget', 'who', 'good', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'nothing', 'drop', 'monocle', 'over.Part', 'what', 'film', 'cast', 'least', 'relatively', 'equal', 'fame', 'so', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'ensemble', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'one', 'exception', ""'ll"", 'get', 'are', 'real', 'standouts', 'factor', 'fairly', 'tepid', 'writing', 'get', 'cast', 'characters', 'tend', 'blur', 'one', 'instance', 'Daniel', 'put-upon', 'writer-wannabe', 'who', 'charge', 'proceedings', 'clashes', 'brother', 'Robert', 'famous', 'writer', 'who', 'also', 'irresponsible', 'vain', 'conflict', 'engineered', 'keep', 'devolving', 'caricatures', 'other', 'exactly', 'what', 'when', 'conflict', 'away', '2/3rds', 'way', 'movie', 'Daniel', 'wife', 'Jane', 'Martha', 'fiance', 'guest', 'getting', 'getting', 'play', 'straight', 'line', 'troubled', 'men', 'so', 'come', 'being', 'exact', 'same', 'person', 'seriously', 'hair', 'clothing', 'even', 'are', 'almost', 'identical', 'above', 'mentioned', 'hypochondriac', 'fumbles', 'stumbles', 'same', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'freneticism', 'character', 'hapless', 'pharmacology', 'student.Which', 'Martha', 'fiance', 'Simon', 'pharmacology', 'student', 'be', 'toting', 'serious', 'hallucinogens', 'bottle', 'labeled', 'Valium', 'course', 'one', 'up', 'down', 'Simon', 'throat', 'Thus', 'have', 'wacky', 'unpredictable', 'lunacy', 'Simon', 'contend', 'Played', 'flawlessly', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Why', ""n't"", 'guy', 'get', 'more', 'parts', 'amazing', 'subplot', 'effectively', 'attention', 'away', 'everything', 'else', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'story', 'up', 'being', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'still', 'enough', 'show', 'make', 'rest', 'movie', 'feel', 'achingly', 'pedestrian', 'Oh', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'bothered', 'title', 'film', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'very', 'very', 'misleading']",N/A

The winners? Auds who know you laugh hardest when you're not supposed to, and who appreciate the humorous qualities of embarrassment, blackmail and the twitting of the upper classes."" John AndersonThis is decidedly a British humour film. The distance between pretension and crazy humour is not too far apart.  The upper crust with their stiff upper lips seem to crack a bit. The patriarch of the house has gone and died. His British gentry friends and his family gather to say good-bye. The stoic older son who with his wife have been living in the family stead, is set to bring off this funeral with dignity. The anxiety he feels is palpable and then his younger brother, the famed novelist from the US arrives and upsets his world again. Into the mix arrives his cousin Martha with her fiancee who has unknowingly ingested a hallucinogen and goes mildly mad. The old debilitated uncle arrives via his wheel chair with two friends one gay and one well, just nerdy. And, one of the little people arrives whom it appears has a secret to sell. Needless to say the funeral goes berserk- a naked wild man on the roof, the little person bound and gagged, the minister who must leave urgently and the family dispositions come undone.  It is all serious to the family and guests but to those of us looking on it is a hilarious romp- I found myself laughing out loud through much of the film.The performances were superb. The staid son, Daniel is played by Matthew Macfadyen with perfection. His wife, Keeley Hawes, who wants a promise that they will put a down payment on the promised flat, plays her role with subtlety. The bereaved mother and wife, Jane Asher, wants no one to upstage her. Rupert Graves, the novelist is a supercilious brat. Martha, Daisy Donovan, steals the movie with her ability to be seriously funny while trying to convince her fiancee, Simon, Alan Tudyk to put his clothes on. Martha's father, Victor played by Peter Egan, is the epitome of the English gentry, a snob.As a farce this often goes over the top, but we forgive the writer and director because we have tears rolling down our cheeks from laughter.Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-29-08Almost StrangersWhere Angels Fear to Tread",4,Try To Keep A Stiff Upper Lip,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,2398,"['circus', 'parade', 'mourning', 'Brits', 'enough', 'appalling', 'circumstances', 'set', 'proper', 'Englishness', 'back', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'Death', 'Funeral', 'decorum', 'sex', 'drugs', 'dysfunction', 'winners', 'Auds', 'who', 'know', 'hardest', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'who', 'appreciate', 'humorous', 'qualities', 'embarrassment', 'blackmail', 'twitting', 'upper', 'classes', 'John', 'AndersonThis', 'decidedly', 'British', 'humour', 'film', 'distance', 'pretension', 'crazy', 'humour', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'apart', 'upper', 'crust', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lips', 'seem', 'crack', 'bit', 'patriarch', 'house', 'gone', 'died', 'British', 'gentry', 'friends', 'family', 'gather', 'say', 'good-bye', 'stoic', 'older', 'son', 'who', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'family', 'stead', 'set', 'bring', 'off', 'funeral', 'dignity', 'anxiety', 'palpable', 'then', 'younger', 'brother', 'famed', 'novelist', 'US', 'arrives', 'upsets', 'world', 'again', 'mix', 'cousin', 'Martha', 'fiancee', 'who', 'unknowingly', 'ingested', 'hallucinogen', 'mildly', 'mad', 'old', 'debilitated', 'uncle', 'wheel', 'chair', 'two', 'friends', 'one', 'gay', 'one', 'well', 'just', 'nerdy', 'one', 'little', 'people', 'whom', 'secret', 'sell', 'Needless', 'say', 'funeral', 'berserk-', 'naked', 'wild', 'man', 'roof', 'little', 'person', 'bound', 'gagged', 'minister', 'who', 'must', 'leave', 'urgently', 'family', 'dispositions', 'come', 'undone', 'serious', 'family', 'guests', 'looking', 'hilarious', 'romp-', 'found', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'much', 'film.The', 'performances', 'were', 'superb', 'staid', 'son', 'Daniel', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'perfection', 'wife', 'Keeley', 'Hawes', 'who', 'promise', 'will', 'put', 'down', 'payment', 'promised', 'flat', 'role', 'subtlety', 'bereaved', 'mother', 'wife', 'Jane', 'Asher', 'one', 'upstage', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'novelist', 'supercilious', 'brat', 'Martha', 'Daisy', 'Donovan', 'movie', 'ability', 'be', 'seriously', 'funny', 'trying', 'convince', 'fiancee', 'Simon', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'put', 'clothes', 'Martha', 'father', 'Victor', 'played', 'Peter', 'Egan', 'epitome', 'English', 'gentry', 'snob.As', 'farce', 'often', 'top', 'forgive', 'writer', 'director', 'have', 'tears', 'rolling', 'down', 'cheeks', 'laughter.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '03-29-08Almost', 'StrangersWhere', 'Angels', 'Fear', 'Tread']",N/A

This movie makes a madcap romp of the unbidden task facing certain family members gathered for a legitimate burial, then confronted with an extra corpse.We get to know these people as memorable characters along the way, which is half the fun. Each player comes onto the scene markedly self-absorbed. In other words, they're a typical family. All the different types are here, including the curmudgeonly uncle, the somewhat overbearing parent, and the doted-upon celebrity son. Some are called upon to come out of themselves a little though, in order to make common cause with each other and to put a lid on their mutual problem.There are two full-length commentaries on this disc - one by the Director, and one by a couple of the actors and the writer. Both are good-natured, but don't provide too many additional insights into the filming or the film.

This is a fully realized, totally overwhelming writing effort.  The movie is uniformly hilarious.  The plot ideas may be a bit far-fetched (hallucinatory drugs???) but the plot isn't the main thing here.  It does get from point A to point B in without falling apart, but it's the journey that's the unbelievably funny part.The acting?  I can see how it might be difficult for the excellent cast to keep it under control while going through this thoroughly side-splitting film.  It's got to be played deadpan, and the actors maintain control during the shenanigans.I can't praise this film high enough.  I've not seen the American remake (why they have to remake a movie in English and in familiar settings is beyond me), but I KNOW it can't be funnier than the original.Do yourself a favor and buy or rent this film today.

1131636,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0011KQSZ4,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[19, 21]","""Death at a Funeral"", the new film from director Frank Oz (""In and Out"", Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"") is a pretty good tribute to the British comedies we used to see with more consistency. A droll, black sense of humor, characters who are as wacky as others are steadfast and the use of a setting we are all familiar with used in an unfamiliar way all help to give this film a whacked out sensibility. But it isn't above moments of crass, bathroom humor and these bring it down.Daniel (Matthew McFadyen, TV's ""MI:5"", ""Pride & Prejudice"") and his wife, Jane (Keely Hawes, TV's ""MI:5"") are living at home with his father and mother when his father dies. They await the arrival of the rest of the family for the funeral. Soon, the house is filled and they have to deal with all of the craziness in everyone's life. Daniel's brother, John (Rupert Graves), a published writer, flies in from New York, first class, and claims he doesn't have any money to help out with the funeral costs. Martha (Daisy Donovan), Daniel's cousin, and her fianc&eacute;e, Simon (Alan Tudyk) stop by to pick up her brother, Troy (Kris Marshall, ""Love Actually""). Simon is a wreck, because Martha's father has never liked him, so Martha decides to give him a Valium she finds in Troy's apartment. The only problem is that Troy is a minor drug dealer and the Valium is in fact a hallucinogen. Then, Peter (Peter Dinklage, ""The Station Agent"") shows up for the service. Daniel doesn't recognize him and is surprised when he asks if they can speak alone.  Peter reveals some information to the son of the deceased, which causes everything to spiral out of control.Directed by Frank Oz, an American director and former Muppeteer, ""Death at a Funeral"" has all the markings on a dark British comedy. It is strange that an American film director would make such a film, but Oz seems to be a good choice; ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" has many similar elements. Despite the broad moments in his comedies, they do share a certain sensibility with the early work or Peter Sellers or Alec Guiness. In ""Death"", Oz dials down the comedy significantly, making it darker, more subtle, more tongue in cheek, more British.The mood of the film is set early on. The undertakers arrive with Daniel's father and set the coffin in the viewing room. They open the casket and Daniel looks inside. ""Who's that? That's not my father."" They have brought the wrong body. They take the casket away and return later with the right body.The real comedic standout in the film is Alan Tudyk who plays Simon, Martha's nervous fianc&eacute;e. Just as they arrive at the country estate, the drugs he has unwittingly ingested begin to take hold and he starts to stare at leaves and flowers. Martha doesn't really know what to make of her boyfriend. During the ceremony, he causes a delay and Martha's father, Victor, dislikes him even more. Through the course of the film, Simon becomes more distraught and more unhinged as the full effects of the drug take place.Simon is the broadest character, but even this is minor when compared to some comedic roles in American films. The major laughs of this character come from his actions in the environment of this country house funeral. Everyone else is trying to remain very proper and respectful as Simon climbs naked on roofs.Matthew McFadyen and Keely Hawes are both good, but they are basically the straight men for the rest of the cast. Daniel and Jane are trying to maintain an air of respectability, and Daniel's known as the `respectable' (boring) son. When Peter makes himself known to Daniel, Daniel begins to act a bit wacky, but the role is still relatively low key.As the story progresses and the characters begin to spiral out of control, the action becomes even more funny because people are acting completely at odds to the setting. When you see a large country house in the English countryside, you think everyone will be acting very proper. When they don't, it creates funny situations and a lot of laugher. This is really the key with most great British comedies. They make fun of themselves, planting tongue firmly in cheek and casting their eye on themselves.""Death at a Funeral"" is not a great film. It can't seem to distance itself from scatological humor; an elderly wheelchair bound Uncle (Peter Vaughn) needs help to get to the bathroom and a family friend Howard (Andy Nyman) seems designated to help him. The situation leads to Howard getting feces on his hand and face. Oz seems to think this is funny, but it is just gross and seems completely at odds with the rest of the film.""Death at a Funeral"" is not a laugh a minute, but is a very humorous and enjoyable diversion. It is a film perfectly suited for DVD rental.",3,Very British Comedy with a Few American Touches,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,4722,"['Death', 'Funeral', 'new', 'film', 'director', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'Out', 'Dirty', 'Rotten', 'Scoundrels', 'pretty', 'good', 'tribute', 'British', 'comedies', 'used', 'see', 'more', 'consistency', 'droll', 'black', 'sense', 'humor', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'wacky', 'others', 'are', 'steadfast', 'use', 'setting', 'are', 'familiar', 'used', 'unfamiliar', 'way', 'help', 'give', 'film', 'whacked', 'out', 'sensibility', ""n't"", 'above', 'moments', 'crass', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'bring', 'down.Daniel', 'Matthew', 'McFadyen', 'TV', 'MI:5', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'wife', 'Jane', 'Keely', 'Hawes', 'TV', 'MI:5', 'are', 'living', 'home', 'father', 'mother', 'when', 'father', 'dies', 'await', 'arrival', 'rest', 'family', 'funeral', 'Soon', 'house', 'filled', 'have', 'deal', 'craziness', 'everyone', 'life', 'Daniel', 'brother', 'John', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'published', 'writer', 'flies', 'New', 'York', 'first', 'class', 'claims', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'help', 'out', 'funeral', 'costs', 'Martha', 'Daisy', 'Donovan', 'Daniel', 'cousin', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Simon', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'stop', 'pick', 'up', 'brother', 'Troy', 'Kris', 'Marshall', 'Love', 'Actually', 'Simon', 'wreck', 'Martha', 'father', 'never', 'liked', 'so', 'Martha', 'give', 'Valium', 'Troy', 'apartment', 'only', 'problem', 'Troy', 'minor', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Valium', 'fact', 'hallucinogen', 'Then', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Station', 'Agent', 'up', 'service', 'Daniel', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'surprised', 'when', 'can', 'speak', 'alone', 'Peter', 'information', 'son', 'deceased', 'everything', 'spiral', 'control.Directed', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'American', 'director', 'former', 'Muppeteer', 'Death', 'Funeral', 'markings', 'dark', 'British', 'comedy', 'strange', 'American', 'film', 'director', 'would', 'make', 'such', 'film', 'Oz', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'Dirty', 'Rotten', 'Scoundrels', 'many', 'similar', 'elements', 'broad', 'moments', 'comedies', 'do', 'share', 'certain', 'sensibility', 'early', 'work', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'Death', 'Oz', 'down', 'comedy', 'significantly', 'making', 'darker', 'more', 'subtle', 'more', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'more', 'British.The', 'mood', 'film', 'set', 'early', 'undertakers', 'arrive', 'Daniel', 'father', 'set', 'coffin', 'viewing', 'room', 'open', 'casket', 'Daniel', 'inside', 'Who', 'not', 'father', 'have', 'brought', 'wrong', 'body', 'take', 'casket', 'away', 'return', 'later', 'right', 'body.The', 'real', 'comedic', 'standout', 'film', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'who', 'Simon', 'Martha', 'nervous', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Just', 'arrive', 'country', 'estate', 'drugs', 'unwittingly', 'ingested', 'begin', 'take', 'hold', 'stare', 'leaves', 'flowers', 'Martha', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'boyfriend', 'ceremony', 'delay', 'Martha', 'father', 'Victor', 'even', 'more', 'course', 'film', 'Simon', 'more', 'distraught', 'more', 'unhinged', 'full', 'effects', 'drug', 'take', 'place.Simon', 'broadest', 'character', 'even', 'minor', 'when', 'compared', 'comedic', 'roles', 'American', 'films', 'major', 'laughs', 'character', 'come', 'actions', 'environment', 'country', 'house', 'funeral', 'Everyone', 'else', 'trying', 'remain', 'very', 'proper', 'respectful', 'Simon', 'climbs', 'naked', 'roofs.Matthew', 'McFadyen', 'Keely', 'Hawes', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'basically', 'straight', 'men', 'rest', 'cast', 'Daniel', 'Jane', 'are', 'trying', 'maintain', 'air', 'respectability', 'Daniel', 'known', 'respectable', 'boring', 'son', 'When', 'Peter', 'known', 'Daniel', 'Daniel', 'act', 'bit', 'wacky', 'role', 'still', 'relatively', 'low', 'key.As', 'story', 'characters', 'begin', 'spiral', 'control', 'action', 'even', 'more', 'funny', 'people', 'are', 'acting', 'completely', 'odds', 'setting', 'When', 'see', 'large', 'country', 'house', 'English', 'countryside', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'acting', 'very', 'proper', 'When', 'do', ""n't"", 'funny', 'situations', 'lot', 'laugher', 'really', 'key', 'most', 'great', 'British', 'comedies', 'make', 'fun', 'planting', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'cheek', 'casting', 'eye', 'Death', 'Funeral', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'distance', 'scatological', 'humor', 'elderly', 'wheelchair', 'Uncle', 'Peter', 'Vaughn', 'help', 'get', 'bathroom', 'family', 'friend', 'Howard', 'Andy', 'Nyman', 'designated', 'help', 'situation', 'Howard', 'getting', 'feces', 'hand', 'face', 'think', 'funny', 'just', 'gross', 'completely', 'odds', 'rest', 'film', 'Death', 'Funeral', 'not', 'laugh', 'minute', 'very', 'humorous', 'enjoyable', 'diversion', 'film', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'DVD', 'rental']",N/A

Death at a Funeral managed to turn a sad occasion upside down while at the same time revealed all the dirty laundry and dark secrets of the main characters that made them interesting. Characters like a self-centred prick who preferred to spend his money on a first class ticket instead of his father's funeral, an uptight lawyer fell prey to hullucination drugs, an arrogant doctor who thought the whole world couldn't match up with him. These are just some of the interesting people you will meet at this funeral.Some of the plots were a bit predictable - basically you know what is coming around the corner. However, it was the way they wrote it and made it that made the film so enjoyable. All the subtleness that revealed just enough comic moments to keep you going and going. There was a bit of physical comedy elements like their American counterparts, but it is the well written British humour that shaped the movie which could easily make it a classic. Some of the topics they touched on were not new, e.g. homosexuality and drugs, but the modern touch up did make it look more refreshing.I will highly recommend it if you want an relaxing evening out for a good laugh.

1131640,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0011KQSZ4,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","I don't exactly know what makes (some, if not all) British comedies so attractive, but to me the biggest reason is talented actors and witty script. I don't know Frank Oz-directed ""Death at a Funeral"" should be really called ""British"" comedy, but it certainly has an impressive list of actors including Matthew Macfadyen and Keeley Hawes. Interestingly, the film's script (penned by Dean Craig) looks as if heavily revised by the directors of ""There's Something About Mary."" Not exactly a bad thing, though.""Death at a Funeral"" opens with one embarrassing (and funny) mistake done to the body of recently deceased father of Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) Through the slow and rather talky opening chapters, the film introduces a group of characters gathering for the funeral of Daniel's father. But among the people there is one person no one seems to know, and one of the family members suddenly starts to act strangely after taking a pill. Daniel has many things to worry about and one of them is about the ""death at his father's funeral.""Don't expect Andrew Davies or Richard Curtis here. Or ""The Trouble with Harry,"" either.  ""Death at a Funeral"" is more like a farce and it delivers the goods. As the film's story goes on, it becomes more and more ridiculous and absurd. The comedy is mostly about toilet jokes (literally), nude jokes, jokes about hallucinogenic drug and so on. Just keep in mind that the director is responsible for ""In & Out"" and Kevin Kline was so brilliant in the otherwise ordinary comedy.And so are the actors in ""Death at a Funeral."" The film relies on old materials, but the gifted actors barely make it watchable.
