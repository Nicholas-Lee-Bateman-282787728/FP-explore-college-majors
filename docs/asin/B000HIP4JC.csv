The acting is horrible, the special effects are not at all special and it is quite innappropriate with a little boy participating in a game of strip poker with some teenagers. I really wish I had not purchased this.

Looks are of course deceiving and this movie was a bomb. I don't think kids would even like this movie. It's cheesy, the effects are awful, and the acting is so over the top that it just destroys any credibility this film may have had. There are movies without a plot, that are hard to follow, that are boring, and so forth, but this, this was just all-around terrible!",1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]- @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,477,"['Monster', 'Night', 'was', 'horror-comedy', 'kid', 'produced', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'looked', 'kind', 'interesting', 'Looks', 'are', 'course', 'deceiving', 'movie', 'was', 'bomb', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kids', 'would', 'even', 'like', 'movie', 'cheesy', 'effects', 'are', 'awful', 'acting', 'so', 'top', 'just', 'credibility', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'are', 'movies', 'plot', 'are', 'hard', 'follow', 'are', 'boring', 'so', 'forth', 'was', 'just', 'all-around', 'terrible']",Monster Night

It's like Scooby-Doo but without the dog.Released in 2006, the story has to do with a family who moves to a castle-like home in a new town, which turns out to be haunted and somehow linked to the creepy local school. When the parents (Robert Carradine and Vanessa Angel) go out for the evening the three kids have a Halloween party and the younger brother goes missing. To find him, the two older siblings team-up with the top jock of the school and his girlfriend; misadventures ensue.The requirements of a film like this are obvious: A good assortment of youthful protagonists, from kids to late-teens? Check. An equally good cast of adults? Check. A quasi-horror ambiance? Check. A fun, silly spirit? Check. Corny, but funny humor? Check. A simple story with a sense of adventure? Check. An assortment of good-lookin' women, young and older? Check. An energetic and rockin' soundtrack? Check. A runtime that doesn't overstay its welcome (like the Pirates of the Caribbean films)? Check.Nuff said.GRADE: B",4,"""Monster Night"" delivers...",1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,1122,"[""'re"", 'mood', 'spooktacular', 'Goosebumps-like', 'horror', 'film', 'fun', 'silly', 'not', 'scary', 'Scooby-Doo', 'dog.Released', '2006', 'story', 'do', 'family', 'who', 'castle-like', 'home', 'new', 'town', 'out', 'be', 'haunted', 'somehow', 'linked', 'creepy', 'local', 'school', 'When', 'parents', 'Robert', 'Carradine', 'Vanessa', 'Angel', 'go', 'out', 'evening', 'three', 'kids', 'have', 'Halloween', 'party', 'younger', 'brother', 'missing', 'find', 'two', 'older', 'siblings', 'team-up', 'top', 'jock', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'ensue.The', 'requirements', 'film', 'are', 'obvious', 'good', 'assortment', 'youthful', 'protagonists', 'kids', 'late-teens', 'Check', 'equally', 'good', 'cast', 'adults', 'Check', 'quasi-horror', 'ambiance', 'Check', 'fun', 'silly', 'spirit', 'Check', 'Corny', 'funny', 'humor', 'Check', 'A', 'simple', 'story', 'sense', 'adventure', 'Check', 'assortment', 'good-lookin', 'women', 'young', 'older', 'Check', 'energetic', 'rockin', 'soundtrack', 'Check', 'runtime', ""n't"", 'overstay', 'welcome', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'films', 'Check.Nuff', 'said.GRADE', 'B']",Monster Night
