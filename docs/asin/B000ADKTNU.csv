I was so glad that lights weren't turned on, I cried and I almost cried out loud. I am a sensitive man, especially when it comes to a poor little bear creature that could have been shot and could have been dead so many times. A beautiful real-life story of a bear Winnie who was not exactly tamed, but she didn't know that she was a bear. This story is so touching and this humanized bear is not like any other bear I've seen. Those eyes she has are not of an animal, but of a human. That love she has for humans and humans that would rather shoot her to get rid of her. Heart-melting experience. True love between Winnie and her human ''owner'' left me speechless. A bear that melted hearts of others, she is like a kid who is so pure and loves everybody. It hurts to know that in reality several people were willing to shoot her. Yes, she changed people around her, but it still hurts to know that there is so much fear and hatred towards these or any other animals. This movie or a book can not have less than 5 stars. I can't understand how people on IMDB gave it 6. something stars out of 10. This movie depicts most of us (not me) the way we are, cruel, often heartless rapists of the nature and its inhabitants. What a wonderful creature. Is Winnie special? Yes. But it does not mean that other animals these days can not be like her. You must buy this movie and watch it, unless you don't care! If I had Winnie, I'd make a monument for her. She made a big impact on me this evening. I don't know what to say. Words mean nothing. I keep thinking of it and I just want to cry. Why can't we just treasure what we have?",5,Don't compare it to Winnie the Pooh!,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,1724,"['Beautiful', 'very', 'touching', 'tragic', 'same', 'movie', 'God', 'watched', 'evening', 'parents', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'lights', 'were', ""n't"", 'turned', 'cried', 'almost', 'cried', 'out', 'loud', 'am', 'sensitive', 'man', 'especially', 'when', 'poor', 'little', 'bear', 'creature', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dead', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'beautiful', 'real-life', 'story', 'bear', 'Winnie', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'tamed', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'bear', 'story', 'so', 'touching', 'humanized', 'bear', 'not', 'other', 'bear', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'eyes', 'are', 'not', 'animal', 'human', 'love', 'humans', 'humans', 'would', 'rather', 'shoot', 'get', 'rid', 'Heart-melting', 'experience', 'True', 'love', 'Winnie', 'human', 'owner', 'left', 'speechless', 'bear', 'melted', 'hearts', 'others', 'kid', 'who', 'so', 'pure', 'everybody', 'know', 'reality', 'several', 'people', 'were', 'willing', 'shoot', 'Yes', 'changed', 'people', 'still', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'fear', 'hatred', 'towards', 'other', 'animals', 'movie', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'people', 'IMDB', 'gave', '6.', 'something', 'stars', '10', 'movie', 'most', 'not', 'way', 'are', 'cruel', 'often', 'heartless', 'rapists', 'nature', 'inhabitants', 'What', 'wonderful', 'creature', 'Winnie', 'special', 'Yes', 'not', 'mean', 'other', 'animals', 'days', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'must', 'buy', 'movie', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'had', 'Winnie', ""'d"", 'make', 'monument', 'made', 'big', 'impact', 'evening', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'Words', 'mean', 'nothing', 'keep', 'thinking', 'just', 'want', 'cry', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'treasure', 'what', 'have']",A Bear Named Winnie

It is the true story of the little real-life bear that inspired the stories.  There is one war scene that might be too much for younger children, but I'd think kids from five year old and up, who watch it with their parents who can reassure them if they become frightened of the war, should be able to enjoy it.

The huntsman doesn't have the heart to shoot the little bear cub and eventually, a soldier in the Veterinary Corps adopts the little bear cub.  His whole troop becomes enamored of the little bear and adopt her as their mascot.  They name her ""Winnipeg"" after the fellow's hometown, but call her ""Winnie"" for short.  One of the top brass enjoys having a mascot, the other top brass holds great disdain for it.  Eventually, however, even the scornful fellow is won over when she pets him.  We are treated to several cute scenes where the soldiers, not knowing what else to do with her, try to set her free back in the wild.  But she always outwits them and comes back.  They end up over in England during World War I and not wanting to expose her to the front lines, they leave her at a zoo in London.  The arrangement initially only temporary.  Poor little Winnie is sad and refuses to eat, but eventually she is able to play with a little girl and both the zoo and the bear are happier as a result.  Her soldier ends up in a rest home for soldiers and his commanding officer seeing his depressed state arranges for Winnie to come visit him at the rest home.  The tears will flow, my Mother and I were both sobbing all throughout the film.  The soldier decides to let her stay at the zoo as the little kids love her and she loves them.  Eventually, the author of Winnie of the Pooh visit the zoo with his son and they start weaving a fancy tale about a bear named ""Winnie!""  For us Americans, some of the accents are hard to understand.  But the film is a definite five star and ten star and Oscar worthy show.

926012,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000ADKTNU,David Bower,"[3, 3]","This is a touching, wonderful story based on a real life adventure which involved a Canadian black bear named Winnipeg, later shortened to Winnie. This small orphan bear cub was adopted by a caring soldier, named Harry Colebourn, a veterinarian, on his way to World War I. Not wanting to abandon the bear cub, Harry manages to smuggle Winnie to England where he is able to get the cub cared for by the London Zoo.The movie does a fabulous job of depicting Harry's loving care for the bear and the close relationship that quickly developed between this young orphan cub and the man. The story is beautifully portrayed and the acting is very effective and believable.Winnie, having been raised by people developed a strong desire to associate with people and interact with them. She became a main attraction at the London Zoo and was greatly loved by both children and adults because of her friendly gentleness and playful attitude. During the time Winnie was a feature attraction at the zoo she actually would carry children around the zoo on her back. Winnie lived from 1914 until 1934 and during her life brought much joy and happiness to children.One of the children she fascinated was a young boy named Christopher Robin Milne who named his teddy bear Winnie in honor of the famous black bear at the London Zoo. His father, A. A. Milne created the famous character, Winnie-the-Pooh, who even today continues to bring happiness to children and adults alike with his fictional adventures.The world owes a debt of thanks to Lt. Harry Colebourn and his love for an orphaned black bear cub named Winnie.",5,Outstanding Family Film,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,1601,"['touching', 'wonderful', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'adventure', 'involved', 'Canadian', 'black', 'bear', 'named', 'Winnipeg', 'later', 'shortened', 'Winnie', 'small', 'orphan', 'bear', 'cub', 'was', 'adopted', 'caring', 'soldier', 'named', 'Harry', 'Colebourn', 'veterinarian', 'way', 'World', 'War', 'Not', 'wanting', 'abandon', 'bear', 'cub', 'Harry', 'smuggle', 'Winnie', 'England', 'where', 'able', 'get', 'cub', 'cared', 'London', 'Zoo.The', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'job', 'depicting', 'Harry', 'loving', 'care', 'bear', 'close', 'relationship', 'quickly', 'developed', 'young', 'orphan', 'cub', 'man', 'story', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'acting', 'very', 'effective', 'believable.Winnie', 'having', 'been', 'raised', 'people', 'developed', 'strong', 'desire', 'associate', 'people', 'interact', 'became', 'main', 'attraction', 'London', 'Zoo', 'was', 'greatly', 'loved', 'children', 'adults', 'friendly', 'gentleness', 'playful', 'attitude', 'time', 'Winnie', 'was', 'feature', 'attraction', 'zoo', 'actually', 'would', 'carry', 'children', 'zoo', 'back', 'Winnie', 'lived', '1914', '1934', 'life', 'brought', 'much', 'joy', 'happiness', 'children.One', 'children', 'fascinated', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'Milne', 'who', 'named', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Winnie', 'honor', 'famous', 'black', 'bear', 'London', 'Zoo', 'father', 'A', 'A.', 'Milne', 'created', 'famous', 'character', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'who', 'even', 'today', 'bring', 'happiness', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'fictional', 'adventures.The', 'world', 'debt', 'thanks', 'Lt.', 'Harry', 'Colebourn', 'love', 'orphaned', 'black', 'bear', 'cub', 'named', 'Winnie']",A Bear Named Winnie
926013,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,B000ADKTNU,D. Blankenship,"[3, 3]","This is most certainly one of those movies that simply make everyone who sees it feel good.  It is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by the entire family, from the youngest to the oldest.  It is almost a must see for any one who is a fan of Winnie-The-Pooh as the story deals with the bear who was in the London Zoo and inspired A. A. Milne in his creation of the fictional Winnie.  (I know it is unreasonable of me, but I have never really trusted or been overly fond of people who are not Pooh fans).The move starts during WWI while Canada is preparing to send the expeditionary to join other countries in Europe.  While in training the Regimental Veterinarian rescues a small black bear cub from certain death, brings her to camp and he and his men and friends take on the task of raising Winnie...a short version for Winnipeg.  Despite Army red tape and daring to beak a very long list of rules and regulations, the men of the Veterinarian Corps are able to smuggle their mascot to England.This movie is loaded with a cast of very fine English actors which include, among others,  David Suchet, Stephen Frye, Michael Fassbender and Gil Bellows.  The acting here is quite good and each actor plays her part perfectly.  I must say that the bear(s) used in shooting this film were absolutely perfect in their assigned roles!How Winnie ends up in the London Zoo is part of the story so as I am not into spoilers, you will simply have to watch this one for yourself.  It is a good tale though and you will enjoy the trip.It should be noted that despite the fact that the fighting of the war is involved here, the makers of this movie have not used any scenes that would be inappropriate for children to watch. The adult viewer will be able to understand perfectly (especially if they are familiar with the fate of many Canadian soldiers who participated in this war), but there are no graphic scenes, I assure you.  There is no bad language in this move, no ungentlemanly behavior noted...it is just a good clean story, and as I said, excellent for the entire family.  Movies like this are getting more and more difficult to find it seems so when you find one, you need to grab it up quick.It is also rather nice to learn a bit about the story behind the story of the creation of one of the most beloved of our children's literary icons.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks.",5,ONE OF THE BETTER RECENT FAMILY FILMS,1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,2368,"['most', 'certainly', 'one', 'movies', 'simply', 'make', 'everyone', 'who', 'feel', 'good', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'entire', 'family', 'youngest', 'oldest', 'almost', 'must', 'see', 'one', 'who', 'fan', 'Winnie-The-Pooh', 'story', 'deals', 'bear', 'who', 'was', 'London', 'Zoo', 'inspired', 'A', 'A.', 'Milne', 'creation', 'fictional', 'Winnie', 'know', 'unreasonable', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'trusted', 'been', 'overly', 'fond', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'Pooh', 'fans', '.The', 'move', 'starts', 'WWI', 'Canada', 'preparing', 'send', 'expeditionary', 'join', 'other', 'countries', 'Europe', 'training', 'Regimental', 'Veterinarian', 'small', 'black', 'bear', 'cub', 'certain', 'death', 'camp', 'men', 'friends', 'take', 'task', 'raising', 'Winnie', 'short', 'version', 'Winnipeg', 'Army', 'red', 'tape', 'daring', 'beak', 'very', 'long', 'list', 'rules', 'regulations', 'men', 'Veterinarian', 'Corps', 'are', 'able', 'smuggle', 'mascot', 'England.This', 'movie', 'loaded', 'cast', 'very', 'fine', 'English', 'actors', 'include', 'others', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Stephen', 'Frye', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'acting', 'here', 'quite', 'good', 'actor', 'part', 'perfectly', 'must', 'say', 'bear', 's', 'used', 'shooting', 'film', 'were', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'assigned', 'roles', 'How', 'Winnie', 'up', 'London', 'Zoo', 'part', 'story', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'spoilers', 'will', 'simply', 'have', 'watch', 'one', 'good', 'tale', 'will', 'enjoy', 'trip.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'fact', 'fighting', 'war', 'involved', 'here', 'makers', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'used', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'watch', 'adult', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'perfectly', 'especially', 'are', 'familiar', 'fate', 'many', 'Canadian', 'soldiers', 'who', 'participated', 'war', 'are', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'assure', 'bad', 'language', 'move', 'ungentlemanly', 'behavior', 'noted', 'just', 'good', 'clean', 'story', 'said', 'excellent', 'entire', 'family', 'Movies', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'difficult', 'find', 'so', 'when', 'find', 'one', 'need', 'grab', 'up', 'quick.It', 'also', 'rather', 'nice', 'learn', 'bit', 'story', 'story', 'creation', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'children', 'literary', 'icons.Don', 'BlankenshipThe', 'Ozarks']",A Bear Named Winnie
