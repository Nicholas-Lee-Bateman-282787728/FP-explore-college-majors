1497965,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B005RVF5XE,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[10, 11]","You would have thought that police series have been done from every conceivable angle over the years, and it is almost an achievement in itself to come up with one which is at all out of the ordinary. However, the script writers have managed to achieve just that with Death in Paradise which is quite an offbeat drama. The series is set on the fictional Caribbean island of Sainte-Marie, but was in fact filmed in Guadeloupe.Episode 1 sees DI Richard Poole of the UK Metropolitan Police seconded to the exotic island from less than exotic London suburb of Croydon, to assist the local police in investigating the murder of an ex pat detective. We quickly get the Caribbean flavour of the island with an under resourced and often laid back police force - as an example, in the first episode we have a goat wandering around the local police station, presumably to emphasise the informal nature of the operation. Poole is quite unaffected and goes about business in what one presumes is his normal modus operandi whilst constantly mopping his brow. How he survived the climate decked out in a dark lounge suit without going down with heat exhaustion is quite a mystery in itself!Murders appear to abound in this tropical paradise. However, it is hard to take it all too seriously between the stereotypical locals and the quintessentially British Poole. I think that some of the plots are so convoluted that they are often more humorous than tense which I imagine is intentional and does make for quite reasonable entertainment. Although in a very different time and setting, Poole's style put me in mind of Poirot - carefully taking everything in and then employing the 'little grey cells' to analyse and pronounce his verdict.This first season consists of eight episodes and we have a second season and hopefully more to come. The final episode finishes with Poole softening his straightlaced outlook somewhat and being reluctantly set to stay on Sainte-Marie.",5,A Rather Different Detective Series,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,1958,"['would', 'have', 'thought', 'police', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'conceivable', 'angle', 'years', 'almost', 'achievement', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'ordinary', 'However', 'script', 'writers', 'have', 'managed', 'achieve', 'just', 'Death', 'Paradise', 'quite', 'offbeat', 'drama', 'series', 'set', 'fictional', 'Caribbean', 'island', 'Sainte-Marie', 'was', 'fact', 'filmed', 'Guadeloupe.Episode', '1', 'sees', 'DI', 'Richard', 'Poole', 'UK', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'seconded', 'exotic', 'island', 'less', 'exotic', 'London', 'suburb', 'Croydon', 'assist', 'local', 'police', 'investigating', 'murder', 'ex', 'pat', 'detective', 'quickly', 'get', 'Caribbean', 'flavour', 'island', 'resourced', 'often', 'laid', 'back', 'police', 'force', 'example', 'first', 'episode', 'have', 'goat', 'wandering', 'local', 'police', 'station', 'presumably', 'emphasise', 'informal', 'nature', 'operation', 'Poole', 'quite', 'unaffected', 'about', 'business', 'what', 'one', 'presumes', 'normal', 'modus', 'operandi', 'whilst', 'constantly', 'mopping', 'brow', 'How', 'survived', 'climate', 'decked', 'out', 'dark', 'lounge', 'suit', 'going', 'down', 'heat', 'exhaustion', 'quite', 'mystery', 'Murders', 'appear', 'abound', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'However', 'hard', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'stereotypical', 'locals', 'quintessentially', 'British', 'Poole', 'think', 'plots', 'are', 'so', 'convoluted', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'humorous', 'tense', 'imagine', 'intentional', 'make', 'quite', 'reasonable', 'entertainment', 'very', 'different', 'time', 'setting', 'Poole', 'style', 'put', 'mind', 'Poirot', 'carefully', 'taking', 'everything', 'then', 'employing', ""'little"", 'grey', 'cells', 'analyse', 'pronounce', 'verdict.This', 'first', 'season', 'eight', 'episodes', 'have', 'second', 'season', 'hopefully', 'more', 'come', 'final', 'episode', 'finishes', 'Poole', 'softening', 'straightlaced', 'outlook', 'somewhat', 'being', 'reluctantly', 'set', 'stay', 'Sainte-Marie']","Death in Paradise Series 1 Set Death in Paradise - Series One  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

1497970,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B005RVF5XE,Happy Reader,"[0, 0]","It's the small Caribbean Island of St. Marie, hot and sultry. In the city of Honor&eacute;, Lord and Lady Solcombe are holding a pool party at their mansion. All of a sudden, a shot cuts the air. Then an alarm rings. Cut to the Honor&eacute; police station, where a constable takes a call and tells his coworker that the Solcombe ""panic room's gone into lockdown. We've got the codes to open it in our safe.""They rush to the house and open the room, only to find the British Chief Detective, their boss, dead on the floor from a bullet. But there's no gun in the room, and no way in or out that wasn't locked down tight.A new temporary Chief Detective is needed, and the London Met sends Richard Poole. Poole makes it clear that this is a temporary assignment, as the sun is too bright, the beach too sandy, the heat too brutal, the police station too antiquated, and, worst of all, about 30% of the people and lots of the culture is still French, from when the island was a French colony. What's an Englander to do? Well, for one thing he insists on wearing his wool suit, buttoned up, shirt and tie and polished shoes. When he has time, he searches for a decent cup of tea.Poole may be initially pedantic and inflexible, but he is also a brilliant policeman. In the first episode, he solves his predecessor's murder. By the end of the 1st season, he and his 3-person staff have learned to appreciate each other and work together well. There are lots of comedic moments as well as good mysteries, and the recurring characters are wonderfully portrayed. The series is filmed on the island of Guadalupe, in the Caribbean's Lesser Antilles, and its vibrant culture is like a fourth cast member.Season 1 premiered on air in England in October 2011, and took until January 2013 to air in the U.S. There are 8 episodes for a total run time of 466 minutes. It's presented in 16:9 aspect ratio with English subtitles. My DVD's give the episodes no names, they're just called Part One, Part Two, etc. The show as aired did not have episode names shown either. For convenience, though, I'll give the episodes title names that are popularly used. There are no DVD extras whatsoever, which is a real shame.This series is EXCELLENT viewing, highly recommended. The biggest question is - where did they find a lizard with such great acting skills? When you're done with it, start in immediately with Season 2. That's what we did!You get two DVD discs with four episodes each.PART ONE: Arriving in Paradise.Poole asks the police sergeant to describe the murdered detective. She replies, ""Not your typical Englishman. You know, charismatic.""Trivia: To explain a MET police officer on the island, they have St Marie be a British territory. However, it's filmed on Guadalupe, a real island that is a French territory. So, vehicle drivers are on the left.PART TWO: Wicked Wedding NightDan and Lisa have a beach wedding at a big resort on St. Marie. Unfortunately, the bride shortly afterwards falls from a 5-story hotel balcony, skewered by a spear gun. Poole's personality and culture clashes are a real irritant to his staff.PART THREE: Predicting MurderAfter dark. Dwayne (Constable Myers) and a lady friend join a group sitting around a fire pit on the beach. An elderly woman stands next to the fire and speaks with a style to raise the hair on the back on your neck - and that's watching it safe from your living room. The party breaks up when she scares everyone with her last words: ""The scarred man... He's coming... He's a killer... He's killed before... Silence me. I'm to be murdered. I'm to be MURDERED!""The next day, our heroes are called to a school, closed for break, where an old woman has been killed by cyanide. Yes, it's the same woman as the night before. The Voodoo connection/prophecy makes the very British Poole most uncomfortable. Even when the school headmaster turns out to be the victim's son-in-law. With a scar on his cheek.Detective Camille to Poole: ""You are the most annoying man I have ever met.""Poole: ""Well, it's a small island.""PART FOUR: Missing a Body?On a dark beach, a man sneers, ""You haven't got the guts. Little mousy Megan. If people only knew. That gun's not even lo...""And the woman holding the pistol shoots him.The next morning, after spending the night collapsed near a pier, she wanders into the Honor&eacute; station, saying, ""Can someone help me? It's my husband. He's dead. I shot him.""Unfortunately, when they take her back to the beach, there's no body. The normally stern Poole almost melts into a puddle at her feet, Megan is so sweet and innocent and soft-spoken. riiiiiiiight!PART FIVE: Spot the DifferenceSt. Marie is too small for an airport. People fly into the near bigger island, Guadalupe, and then take a ferry to St. Marie. Poole is at the Guadalupe airport to meet Vincent Carter, prison guard, and Leon Hamilton, prisoner. Hamilton is to serve the last part of his prison sentence on St. Marie, the place where he defrauded hundreds of people. Poole takes custody of Hamilton by being handcuffed to him, though, to be safe, Carter will escort them to the Honor&eacute; jail.Unfortunately, there's a little problem on the ferry, as the Commissioner later booms to the humiliated Poole: ""I could understand if he was secretly poisoned. In fact, secretly anything. I could even forgive a gunshot from another boat or a jet-ski or a helicopter. But no. A knife was plunged into his back while YOU were standing next to him, JOINED at the wrists!""PART SIX: An Unhelpful AidCamille is in Paris on an IT course. Poole has come down with tropical fever. It's up to Constables Dwayne and Fidel to figure out how a scuba diver drowned in a few feet of water. This episode has some great comedy with the feverish Poole insisting that he still can work.Trivia: Sara Martins, who plays Camille, was originally a bigger part of the script. Unfortunately, she had an injury and missed most of the filming.PART SEVEN: Music of MurderCamille and Dwayne have dragged Poole to the biggest musical event of the year. The group, The Venerators, hasn't been on stage for 10 years, and this is their big come-back. The excitement is crazy, so crazy that Poole attempts unsuccessfully to escape. But at last, the show is about to start. Just like in the old days, the charismatic lead singer is carried in, inside a closed and decorated coffin. The crowd cheers as the coffin is set upright on the stage, opened, and there he is, in his dance of death make-up. But something's wrong. He's not moving. For a good reason - there's a bullet hole in his temple. Good thing Camille forced Poole to stay.PART EIGHT: Amongst UsIt's a balmy evening, and Poole is relaxing at home in his jammies, doing a crossword with the lizard. In the meanwhile, Dwayne, the charmer, picks up a woman at a bar and walks her home. She invites him in for coffee and this leads to that, etc.Unfortunately, the next morning, her neighbor finds her dead, lying in bed with coins stuffed into her mouth. And Dwayne's police badge under the bed.Other clues point to Dwayne, too, and Poole is hard pressed to figure out who is framing his constable.Trivia: I didn't want to believe it, but Harry the Lizard is 100% CGI. I'm heartbroken.This is a great series with lots of humor and heart and well-plotted mysteries.",5,Episode Synopsis For a FABULOUS Series - But No DVD Extras!,1404432000,"07 4,

The supporting cast is fun and although bewildered by their new boss, they do their best to help him adjust.  This is a great team, with lots of rapport and loyalty toward one another.

1497972,AO29UXKSDV6EA,B005RVF5XE,irish75,"[0, 0]","Perhaps THE best and freshest mystery I've seen.  Wit, humor, murder and puzzles galore.  I like a dialog that keeps me guessing, and with this show, you seldom see the responses coming.

1497979,ANGNKTK2J7JFF,B005RVF5XE,Madeline,"[26, 27]","When I was little, I read pretty much the complete works of Agatha Christie--and so the comparison between her usual formula and this show immediately hit home. Quirky detective falls into an interesting story where the clues seem random and the suspects are a tight group of people who all have motive. Then in the final ten minutes, said hero pulls everyone together and reveals all. Kinda like Sherlock Holmes in that regard, except this isn't a show really about intricate plot twists or even the ""clues"" necessarily.Each episode is a character study, both of the suspects as well as the detective and his three officers (They live on a small island--and this contributes mightily to the whole series, what could otherwise be a boring police procedural turns into something really fresh as there isn't many of the modern police norms that you see in say CSI all the time. But not like in a ""wow they live in dark ages way"",  more like in a ""wow, they have to send the DNA to a bigger island with a real lab and will have to wait on the results for a few days instead of instantly magically knowing."")This show really works for me. It's similar to Christie's works (which I love). It never gets too dark even when dealing with murder, rape, betrayal etc. The chemistry between the detective and his three police officers is simply delightful (proper English fellow with no social life slowly gets pulled out of his routine yet his officers also really develop a lot of respect/affection for him as well). And between him and his gorgeous police partner--goodness gracious, its the perfect romantic situation where two polar opposites are forced to spend large amounts of time together and then realize that they're not so opposite and actually they kinda might like each other. I sincerely hope this show gets renewed enough to finally see those two kiss or even just hug for that matter.This is just fun.

I purchased this sight-unseen from Amazon UK based on recommendations, and I definitely hit the jackpot with this one.This is one of those fun, old-fashioned whodunits with twisty plots and clever detectives. None of the grit and darkness and realism you see in most modern cop shows. It is without a doubt a breath of fresh air for those of us who really want to just kick back and ENJOY watching TV.I watched the eight hour-long episodes over a rainy weekend, and knew I had found a real gem. But the magnitude of how much I enjoyed it didn't hit me until afterwards ... when I kept going over it in my mind, wishing there were more episodes to watch. Rarely have I wanted to put the DVD back in and start over, but this was one of those times.In a nutshell, the show is about an English detective who is sent to an island in the Caribbean to solve a tricky (read: impossible) murder. In truly predictable fashion, he refuses to stop wearing a suit and tie, complains about the heat, finds a tree growing through his living room and a lizard that keeps popping up, and clashes (initially) with his fellow cops. But he is truly brilliant, solves the case, and promptly gets assigned there permanently, much to his dismay and the sergeant who has to work with him.It's such a simple, predictable premise it hardly seems likely to work as well as it does - but it does, due in no small part to the talents of the actors. DI Poole is somehow completely likeable, despite his obstinate refusal to ""loosen up"" and his complete lack of social skills. I give Ben Miller full credit for this. His comic timing is perfect, and he manages to be charming even while he's incredibly frustrating. Huge thumbs-up also for Sara Martins, who was previously unknown to me. Flamboyant and belligerent, she manages to be somehow sweet and thoroughly likeable. The ""minor"" characters Dwayne and Fidel are likeable also, and all of them very easy on the eyes. Lots of very well-known British actors make appearances, among them Nicholas Farrell, Colin Salmon, Miranda Raison, Danny Webb, Clare Holman, Rupert Graves, Sarah Smart, Shirley Henderson, and Paterson Joseph. And who can blame them?Perhaps the real star is the location. Paradise? Personally, watching poor DI Poole sweating and nearly passing out every five minutes doesn't exactly encourage me to visit the Caribbean myself, but it makes a really fantastic backdrop for some very clever whodunits, and provides most of the humor along the way as two very different cultures continue to clash.I don't know when or if this series is going to be released in the US, but for those of you out there who enjoy good, FUN British mysteries and have (or are thinking of getting) a multi-region player, you really CAN'T go wrong with this. Only buy it direct from the UK, it'll cost you a lot less.10/10",5,Life isn't all fun and games; fortunately Death in Paradise is!,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,2938,"['ever', 'need', 'reason', 'purchase', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'purchased', 'sight-unseen', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'based', 'recommendations', 'definitely', 'hit', 'jackpot', 'one.This', 'one', 'fun', 'old-fashioned', 'whodunits', 'twisty', 'plots', 'clever', 'detectives', 'None', 'grit', 'darkness', 'realism', 'see', 'most', 'modern', 'cop', 'shows', 'doubt', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'who', 'really', 'want', 'just', 'kick', 'back', 'ENJOY', 'watching', 'TV.I', 'watched', 'eight', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'rainy', 'weekend', 'knew', 'had', 'found', 'real', 'gem', 'magnitude', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'afterwards', 'when', 'kept', 'going', 'mind', 'wishing', 'were', 'more', 'episodes', 'watch', 'Rarely', 'have', 'wanted', 'put', 'DVD', 'back', 'start', 'was', 'one', 'nutshell', 'show', 'English', 'detective', 'who', 'sent', 'island', 'Caribbean', 'solve', 'tricky', 'read', 'impossible', 'murder', 'truly', 'predictable', 'fashion', 'stop', 'wearing', 'suit', 'tie', 'heat', 'tree', 'growing', 'living', 'room', 'lizard', 'popping', 'up', 'clashes', 'initially', 'fellow', 'cops', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'case', 'promptly', 'assigned', 'permanently', 'much', 'dismay', 'sergeant', 'who', 'work', 'him.It', 'such', 'simple', 'predictable', 'premise', 'hardly', 'likely', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'due', 'small', 'part', 'talents', 'actors', 'DI', 'Poole', 'somehow', 'completely', 'likeable', 'obstinate', 'refusal', 'loosen', 'up', 'complete', 'lack', 'social', 'skills', 'give', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'full', 'credit', 'comic', 'timing', 'perfect', 'be', 'charming', 'even', 'incredibly', 'frustrating', 'Huge', 'thumbs-up', 'also', 'Sara', 'Martins', 'who', 'was', 'previously', 'unknown', 'Flamboyant', 'belligerent', 'be', 'somehow', 'sweet', 'thoroughly', 'likeable', 'minor', 'characters', 'Dwayne', 'Fidel', 'are', 'likeable', 'also', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'Lots', 'very', 'well-known', 'British', 'actors', 'make', 'appearances', 'Nicholas', 'Farrell', 'Colin', 'Salmon', 'Miranda', 'Raison', 'Danny', 'Webb', 'Clare', 'Holman', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'Sarah', 'Smart', 'Shirley', 'Henderson', 'Paterson', 'Joseph', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'Perhaps', 'real', 'star', 'location', 'Paradise', 'Personally', 'watching', 'poor', 'DI', 'Poole', 'sweating', 'nearly', 'passing', 'out', 'five', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'encourage', 'visit', 'Caribbean', 'really', 'fantastic', 'backdrop', 'very', 'clever', 'whodunits', 'most', 'humor', 'way', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'cultures', 'continue', 'clash.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'series', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'US', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'FUN', 'British', 'mysteries', 'have', 'are', 'thinking', 'getting', 'multi-region', 'player', 'really', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Only', 'buy', 'direct', 'UK', ""'ll"", 'cost', 'lot', 'less.10/10']","Death in Paradise Series 1 Set Death in Paradise - Series One  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

1497984,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B005RVF5XE,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 1]","IMPORETANT NOTE: As I post this review there are already 47 reviews posted here. But many are of other versions of this release.  That is because Amazon combines ALL reviews of ALL formats (broadcast TV, Streaming, Non-US region versions and US DVD) when they list the reviews. I always recommend that prospective buyers sort by &#8220;newest first&#8221; and then look to see what format is being reviewed. With that said, on to my review of the US DVD release (2014)It&#8217;s a good thing that the town of Honore&#8217; on the French Island of Saint Marie, where this delightful &#8220;mystery series&#8221; from the BBC&#8217;s French Division (Yes, the BBC has a French division as well as one in Ireland and another in ) is a a fictional town on a fictional island, because there are so many folks being murdered there.  In the first season of the series which aired in 2011 in the UK, but just now making its US DVD debut, there were eight murders in the the course of eight episodes.What makes DIP unique is that, while it takes place in the Caribbean (actually filmed in Guadeloupe), the main character is a British detective who gets transferred there and becomes a &#8220;fish out of water&#8221;.If you&#8217;ve read my other reviews here on Amazon, you will know that I am not a big fan of &#8220;spoilers&#8221; &#8211; especially &#8220;mystery series&#8221;. Too much info takes the fun out of discovering what happened, who did it, and why.  I also never understood why there are lengthy &#8220;plot summaries&#8221; for each episode posted. Again, this spoils the fun. So you won&#8217;t find those in my reviews, yet I hope I can provide some basic info to guide you and my reviews of DVDs are always of the US releases on Bluray and DVD. So with that in mind:Each of the 8 episodes here runs about 58 minutes.  The series was shown on US TV on regional PBS stations, not nationally, so it was new to me.  If you saw the show on PBS, it was probably edited because they need time for &#8220;promotional&#8221; and &#8220;funding&#8221; spots. But there is no nudity or strong language or graphic violence more than is usually shown on PBS.The lead character &#8211; played by Britisher Ben Miller &#8211; is sort of a hybrid (in my opinion) of David Frost and John Cleese. They play up his need for a suit and tie (when it&#8217;s always in the 90s) or a regular cup of HOT tea. Miller is great, especially if you enjoy British humor.For each episode, there is a murder in the first few minutes and it is solved by the end. The private lives of Miller&#8217;s character and his police team are covered too, and this creates a thread through all episodes. While &#8211; and I hope this is not a real spoiler &#8211; the series continued into for at least four series (I&#8217;m not saying any more about that!), this series ends with all the &#8220;loose ends&#8221; tied up. No annoying &#8220;cliff hangers&#8221;  to deal with.  I really appreciated that!The DVD set in the US has English subtitle option but &#8211; unlike many British mystery DVDs, I didn&#8217;t have any problem understanding every word and the characters do not have heavy accents. There are no bonus features on this set either, though a short one with the cast might have been fun.This series was a nice change of pace from some of there &#8220;darker&#8221; crime series I&#8217;ve been watching and there is a lot of friendly humor here.
