947856,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BQ5J1I,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 12]","I am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur Yasujiro Ozu, whose masterfully understated views of Japanese life, especially in the post-WWII era, illuminate universal truths. Having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949's ""Late Spring"" and 1953's ""Tokyo Story"", I am convinced that Ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery. It is Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien's keen aspiration to pay homage to Ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film. Along with co-screenwriter T'ien-wen Chu, Hsiao-hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable.The story concerns Yoko, a young Japanese writer researching the life of mid-20th century Taiwanese composer Jiang Wen-Ye in Tokyo after coming back from Taiwan where she taught Japanese. After 25 drawn-out minutes of character set-up, she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in Taiwan. At the same time, Yoko's coffeehouse friend Hajime, who runs a used bookstore, has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her. Hsiao-hsien connects this slim plotline with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes. There are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains. While these techniques are consistent with Ozu's style, Hsiao-hsien cannot seem to dive into the characters' psyches the way Ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics, in particular, Yoko's plight seems rather non-committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents' reaction overly passive to hold much interest. In fact, the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it, which makes the film feel interminable.The performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable. J-pop music star Yo Hitoto brings a natural ease to Yoko, while Tadanobu Asano is something of a cipher as Hajime. The rest of the characters barely register, even Nenji Kobayashi and Kimiko Yo as Yoko's parents. Cinematographer Lee Ping-Bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of Ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots. Hitoto speak-sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits, ""Hito-Shian"".  The DVD includes an hour long, French-made documentary, ""Metro Lumiere"", which actually does help provide some of the context for Hsiao-hsien's approach to the film. It includes excerpts from Ozu's films, in particular, ""Equinox Flower"", to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either ""Tokyo Story"" or ""Early Summer"", the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set-ups. There are also edited interview clips of Hitoto, Asano and Hsiao-hsien, as well as the film's trailer.",2,Aspiring to Be an Ozu-Like Work But Muddled by Lethargic Pacing and Character Weightlessness,1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,2975,"['am', 'relative', 'latecomer', 'transcendent', 'work', 'film', 'auteur', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'masterfully', 'understated', 'views', 'Japanese', 'life', 'especially', 'post-WWII', 'era', 'illuminate', 'universal', 'truths', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'several', 'landmark', 'films', 'such', '1949', 'Late', 'Spring', '1953', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'am', 'convinced', 'Ozu', 'had', 'particularly', 'idiosyncratic', 'gift', 'conveying', 'range', 'feelings', 'arising', 'intergenerational', 'conflict', 'elliptical', 'narratives', 'subtle', 'imagery', 'Taiwanese', 'director', 'Hou', 'Hsiao-hsien', 'keen', 'aspiration', 'pay', 'homage', 'Ozu', 'centenary', 'generally', 'enervating', '2003', 'film', 'co-screenwriter', ""T'ien-wen"", 'Chu', 'Hsiao-hsien', 'get', 'visuals', 'right', 'not', 'capture', 'requisite', 'emotional', 'weight', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'glacial', 'pacing', 'tolerable.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Yoko', 'young', 'Japanese', 'writer', 'researching', 'life', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'Taiwanese', 'composer', 'Jiang', 'Wen-Ye', 'Tokyo', 'coming', 'back', 'Taiwan', 'where', 'taught', 'Japanese', '25', 'drawn-out', 'minutes', 'character', 'set-up', 'father', 'stepmother', 'pregnant', 'one', 'students', 'Taiwan', 'same', 'time', 'Yoko', 'coffeehouse', 'friend', 'Hajime', 'who', 'used', 'bookstore', 'obsession', 'trains', 'likely', 'be', 'love', 'Hsiao-hsien', 'connects', 'slim', 'plotline', 'series', 'shots', 'held', 'inordinately', 'lengthy', 'frame', 'composition', 'changes', 'are', 'also', 'long', 'stretches', 'silence', 'as', 'well', 'abundance', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'trains', 'techniques', 'are', 'consistent', 'Ozu', 'style', 'Hsiao-hsien', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'dive', 'characters', 'psyches', 'way', 'Ozu', 'did', 'maximal', 'fluidity', 'minimal', 'theatrics', 'particular', 'Yoko', 'plight', 'rather', 'non-committal', 'scheme', 'drama', 'presented', 'parents', 'reaction', 'overly', 'passive', 'hold', 'much', 'interest', 'fact', 'whole', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'exhaustion', 'film', 'feel', 'interminable.The', 'performances', 'are', 'unobtrusive', 'hardly', 'memorable', 'J-pop', 'music', 'star', 'Yo', 'Hitoto', 'natural', 'ease', 'Yoko', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'something', 'cipher', 'Hajime', 'rest', 'characters', 'barely', 'register', 'even', 'Nenji', 'Kobayashi', 'Kimiko', 'Yo', 'Yoko', 'parents', 'Cinematographer', 'Lee', 'Ping-Bing', 'expert', 'work', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'Ozu', 'films', 'not', 'keeping', 'camera', 'stable', 'shots', 'Hitoto', 'fetching', 'pop', 'song', 'used', 'ending', 'credits', 'Hito-Shian', 'DVD', 'hour', 'long', 'French-made', 'documentary', 'Metro', 'Lumiere', 'actually', 'help', 'provide', 'context', 'Hsiao-hsien', 'approach', 'film', 'excerpts', 'Ozu', 'films', 'particular', 'Equinox', 'Flower', 'show', 'parallels', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'mention', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'Early', 'Summer', 'obvious', 'basis', 'scenes', 'situation', 'set-ups', 'are', 'also', 'edited', 'interview', 'clips', 'Hitoto', 'Asano', 'Hsiao-hsien', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'trailer']",Cafe Lumiere

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[2, 5]","""Cafe Lumiere"" is the homage that Hou Hsiao-hsien, a Taiwanese director, paid to Yasujiro Ozu, a Japanese director renowned for the way in which he managed to depict the dynamics of family life and the inner life of his characters.Did he succeed? I think so, due to the fact that he manages to put the spectator in the place of Yoko, a young woman that is pregnant but doesn't feel like marrying her boyfriend, a grown man that remains too attached to his mother. As we watch ""Cafe Lumiere"", we want to know what she thinks, and how she is going to react to the new development in her life. The spectator is also interested in her friend, a bookstore owner that seems romantically interested in Yoko, and that has an unlikely but strangely poetic hobby.Are you likely to enjoy this movie? I really don't know, because ""Caf&eacute; Lumiere"" is a peculiar movie, the kind that some love, but others hate. I can tell you that it is a beautifully made film that pays extraordinary attention to little details, but that has an extremely open ending. Can you like that kind of film?

947858,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000BQ5J1I,Paul Allaer,"[1, 2]","Movie: 3.5 stars; Bonus materials: 4.5 stars""Cafe Lumiere"" (2003 release from Japan; 104 min.) starts off with informing us that this movie is a homage to the centenary of the birth of famed Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu. As the movie then stars, we follow a young woman, Yoko, as she lives her daily life. She takes care of her (very small) apartment in Tokyo. She goes to visit her parents in suburban Tokyo. She is following up on leads for a story she wants to write about a Taiwanese composer Jiang Wen-Ye, who ncame to Japan at a young age (and whose work is featured on the soundtrack). She even reveals that she is pregnant and has no intention to marry the baby-daddy, a far-away boyfriend in Taiwan. She also befriends a bookshop owner who in his spare time loves to record the sounds of the trains and tramcars in the vast public transportation system in Tokyo.Several comments: the movie may puzzle some, as seemingly not much is happening, other than we follow Yoko in her daily life. But notice how much time is spent on the trains and tramways transportation system in Tokyo, which the director brings onto the screen at times almost like a ballet, just mesmorizing. But this movie should NOT be viewed in isolation. If you are, like I was, more or less ignorant about Japanese director Ozu, by all means make sure to check out the bonus materials of this DVD release, including interviews with the director and the actress portraying Yoko. Most essential of all is the bonus documentary called ""Metro Lumiere"", a 75 min. French documentary that delves into the nitty gritty of Japanese director Ozu, and how Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien became involved in this and ultimately directed the movie. After having seen the actual movie, I thought this documentary was simply fantastic in bringing new perspectives, and in that sense I rate it higher than the movie itself.

947859,A3BVHPDNG36WO1,B000BQ5J1I,"Phillip Royer ""sitenoise""","[1, 3]","You have to like trains, find them romantic or aesthetically pleasing in order to enjoy this movie to the fullest: there's a train going by; there she is walking to the train; there she is getting on the train; there she is on the train; there she is getting off the train; there she is walking away from the train ... cut. Rinse and repeat.Having said that, she, Yo Hitoto, a Japanese singer making her film debut here, is fabulous. I enjoyed her 'hmm', 'hai', 'mmm', 'grunt' style acting. I've never heard acting like it before. She gives a very natural and genuine performance. She's great. Her mom and dad are great. Tadanobu Asano is here. He's a good enough actor that you can sense his muted desire in subtle ways. Almost every minute of people interaction in this film, even in silence, is superb. But the film is padded with a lot of train rides and walking.I assume we are to live with Hitoto's internals while she is traveling around doing nothing. The problem (or contradiction) with that approach is that we are presented with a character who appears not to have much going on inside, problem-wise. She is overtly presented as someone rather carefree. The spectacular scene where her parents come to visit and she speaks her mind about the man who made her pregnant gave me no sense that it was troubling to her. This seems at odds with the desire of the film. Or else it's genius. I was touched by (what turned out to be) the end of the film, until it turned out to be the end of the film. Hitoto's reaction both times to waking up to Asano's character: the first time when she has the flu and the second time at the end of the film, were lovely as could be. I give Hou high marks for reiterating the theme, and for making it obvious the first time and subtle the second but sadly, final time. Waking up to the little joys in life, done without fanfare. Hou does possess a subtle brilliance.I understand what Hou is trying to do. I really think I get this thing. Well ... a couple things. One is the pace, creating a tempo, a rhythm. The other is creating a scenario with compelling characters that is deep enough to be immersive but not thick enough to proceed and resolve in traditionally expected ways. Basically, we should be left wanting more. We're given the gift of letting our imaginations fill in the blanks. That's a good thing. I just think Hou filled Cafe Lumiere with a little too much un-engaging material, although the Taiwanese director did highlight, very well, many of the family and generational issues that show up as the theme in many of the best Japanese films.The nonchalance of the daughter towards her pregnancy is not an approach her parents share. Nor is her un-romantic, pragmatic view of the man who made her pregnant.I am suspicious of (these whatever generation) film makers who employ the nothingness technique in the name of realism. I think some of them are jerks who just want to be challenging, some of them are inept and don't realize they aren't succeeding in making something good, and some of them do things that appeal to others but not to me.I'm not against the technique. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And sometimes trains, or at least train tracks, are used very effectively.",3,A good Japanese film from a Taiwanese film maker.

Zwick,"[6, 13]","**1/2A Japanese movie with a French title, ""Caf&eacute; Lumiere"" is a desultory tale of a young pregnant woman and her friendship with a local bookstore proprietor.  As the movie is almost militantly anti-narrative in its stance, there really isn't much more one can provide in the way of helpful plot summary.Director Hsiao-hsien Hou has opted for a Spartan style of filmmaking that harkens back to such early Japanese masters as Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi.  Each scene consists of a single medium or long shot with no close-ups or edits whatsoever.  The result is that we become so detached from the characters on screen that we find ourselves unengaged in their problems and their fates.  And this turns out to be a particularly serious problem in this case because the spare screenplay offers us so little of interest to start with.  The story consists mainly of Yoko wandering around the city or moping in her apartment as she goes about the tasks of her daily life.  She rides on trains, entertains her visiting parents, spends infrequent moments with her storeowner friend - and that's about it: no revelatory conversations, no insights into character, no point or purpose beyond the prosaic surface.  Admittedly, some of the compositions are stunning and the style is intriguing and hypnotic at first, but it soon loses its charm as the tedium of the narrative (or non-narrative) takes over.The acting is consistently understated and naturalistic, but in a movie in which everybody just looks preoccupied and pensive, there really isn't much call for anything else.",2,art film strangely devoid of life,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,1579,"['**1/2A', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'French', 'title', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'Lumiere', 'desultory', 'tale', 'young', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'friendship', 'local', 'bookstore', 'proprietor', 'movie', 'almost', 'militantly', 'anti-narrative', 'stance', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'one', 'can', 'provide', 'way', 'helpful', 'plot', 'summary.Director', 'Hsiao-hsien', 'Hou', 'opted', 'Spartan', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'back', 'such', 'early', 'Japanese', 'masters', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'Kenji', 'Mizoguchi', 'scene', 'single', 'medium', 'long', 'shot', 'close-ups', 'edits', 'whatsoever', 'result', 'become', 'so', 'detached', 'characters', 'screen', 'find', 'unengaged', 'problems', 'fates', 'out', 'be', 'particularly', 'serious', 'problem', 'case', 'spare', 'screenplay', 'offers', 'so', 'little', 'interest', 'start', 'story', 'mainly', 'Yoko', 'wandering', 'city', 'moping', 'apartment', 'tasks', 'daily', 'life', 'trains', 'visiting', 'parents', 'infrequent', 'moments', 'storeowner', 'friend', 'revelatory', 'conversations', 'insights', 'character', 'point', 'purpose', 'prosaic', 'surface', 'Admittedly', 'compositions', 'are', 'stunning', 'style', 'intriguing', 'hypnotic', 'first', 'soon', 'charm', 'tedium', 'narrative', 'non-narrative', 'over.The', 'acting', 'consistently', 'understated', 'naturalistic', 'movie', 'everybody', 'just', 'preoccupied', 'pensive', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'call', 'anything', 'else']",Cafe Lumiere
