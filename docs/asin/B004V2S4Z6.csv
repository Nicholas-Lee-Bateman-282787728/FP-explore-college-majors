1429854,A16CWY4RZS28DL,B004V2S4Z6,F. Fairfield,"[3, 7]","I bought this to improve my understandingn of spoken Portuguese.  It will serve its purpose. As entertainment, it is not very good:So far, I have watched the first three episodes, about 50 minutes each.  Some of this time is spent showing women either getting undressed or having sex, or Mandrake trying to seduce them.  That does not leave much time for plot and character development.  The whole thing is sketchy.Mandrake seems to be an imitation of Marlowe (the hero of Dashiell Hammett's detective novels, if I am not mistaken).  The music sounds like an imitation of the Pink Panther theme.  All this adds up to something rather mediocre.As I said, I bought it because it is in Portuguese (with subtitles); I bought it from Standing Ovations for $13.09 including shipping and handling; received it in about one week.  That's about $1 per episode; it's not worth more.As entertainment, I would not recommend it.June 22 - After watching three more episodes, I downgraded this series to one star (actually it deserves a plain zero).  The sixth episode is mostly about Mandrake's predicament:  he has a problem with his penis and the urologist has warned him that an erection would be extremely painful.  Naturally, all women are after him; not just women, but women-on-drugs too; and he has to work on a case involving some guru demonstrating new Kama Sutra positions (shown in the video), at a party where everybody is on Ecstasy and Viagra.  As in the other episodes, the plot is practically non-existent. This is pure trash; from HBO. For years I have steadily refused to subscribe to cable television; now I know I was right.",1,I would not bother....,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,1631,"['bought', 'improve', 'understandingn', 'spoken', 'Portuguese', 'will', 'serve', 'purpose', 'entertainment', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'So', 'far', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', '50', 'minutes', 'time', 'spent', 'showing', 'women', 'getting', 'undressed', 'having', 'sex', 'Mandrake', 'trying', 'seduce', 'not', 'leave', 'much', 'time', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'whole', 'thing', 'sketchy.Mandrake', 'be', 'imitation', 'Marlowe', 'hero', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'detective', 'novels', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken', 'music', 'imitation', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'theme', 'up', 'something', 'rather', 'mediocre.As', 'said', 'bought', 'Portuguese', 'subtitles', 'bought', 'Standing', 'Ovations', '13.09', 'including', 'shipping', 'handling', 'received', 'one', 'week', 'about', '1', 'episode', 'not', 'worth', 'more.As', 'entertainment', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'it.June', '22', 'watching', 'three', 'more', 'episodes', 'downgraded', 'series', 'one', 'star', 'actually', 'plain', 'zero', 'sixth', 'episode', 'mostly', 'Mandrake', 'predicament', 'problem', 'penis', 'urologist', 'warned', 'erection', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'painful', 'Naturally', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'women', 'women-on-drugs', 'too', 'work', 'case', 'involving', 'guru', 'demonstrating', 'new', 'Kama', 'Sutra', 'positions', 'shown', 'video', 'party', 'where', 'everybody', 'Ecstasy', 'Viagra', 'other', 'episodes', 'plot', 'practically', 'non-existent', 'pure', 'trash', 'HBO', 'years', 'have', 'steadily', 'refused', 'subscribe', 'cable', 'television', 'now', 'know', 'was', 'right']",Mandrake: Season 1 & 2

1429856,A22KG0EAUW6U7I,B004V2S4Z6,Lost Wanderer,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this show. A lot of Brazilian flavor. The heat, the sweat, the flesh, the rhythm... It is far more straight-forward fun than somewhat depressing another Brazilian HBO series ""Alice"". If promiscuity and depravity disgust you then this show is not for you, but Mandrake's inability to think straight in front of beautiful women gives the character more depth.Prior to buying I was a little worried about the poor reviews on the video quality. Some episodes of ""Alice"" DVD's from the same publisher were like copied from VHS tapes. I am a low-tech guy, not very fussy about video/sound qualities, and while I agree that Mandrake DVD's video quality is not the best, I don't think it is particularly distracting either. Or it almost feels like it fits the atmosphere of the show: steamy, slightly hazy and smoky (Mandrake loves cigars). Unless you demand the crispest images, you can still enjoy the show like I did.",5,Bra-zi-wu,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,929,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'lot', 'Brazilian', 'flavor', 'heat', 'sweat', 'flesh', 'rhythm', 'far', 'more', 'straight-forward', 'fun', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'Brazilian', 'HBO', 'series', 'Alice', 'promiscuity', 'depravity', 'disgust', 'then', 'show', 'not', 'Mandrake', 'inability', 'think', 'straight', 'front', 'beautiful', 'women', 'character', 'more', 'depth.Prior', 'buying', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'poor', 'reviews', 'video', 'quality', 'episodes', 'Alice', 'DVD', 'same', 'publisher', 'were', 'like', 'copied', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'am', 'low-tech', 'guy', 'not', 'very', 'fussy', 'video/sound', 'qualities', 'agree', 'Mandrake', 'DVD', 'video', 'quality', 'not', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'particularly', 'distracting', 'almost', 'atmosphere', 'show', 'steamy', 'slightly', 'hazy', 'smoky', 'Mandrake', 'cigars', 'demand', 'crispest', 'images', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'show', 'did']",Mandrake: Season 1 & 2
1429857,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B004V2S4Z6,MacJunegrand,"[0, 0]","This show was released on HBO several years ago, but I never watched it.  I didn't know what to make of the commercials, so I didn't pay attention to it.  A friend of mine watched it, though, and he loved it.  He recommended it to me and told me to get the DVD, so I did, and I have a few things to say about this set.First, the show is FANTASTIC.  It's about a criminal lawyer's life and his less-than-legal side jobs.  Being a brazilian production, is quite filled with nudity, and the theme of the show is filled with violence and crimes, drug use, sexual exploits, etc.  Definitely not for children, but adults will find it very appealing, specially because, I assure you, it's quite HILARIOUS.Second, the DVD quality is TERRIBLE.  The transfer looks so amateurish you'll swear it was a bootleg product.  The video suffers from what's called ""postage stamping"".  That is, instead of using the original widescreen ratio, they used the one that was transferred to fullscreen for TVs and transferred it back to widescreen.  The result is that the picture is smaller, fitting inside a black box on your TV.  Zooming the picture will help get rid of the black bars, but then the quality of the video will be lower.  It's a ridiculous thing, and we shouldn't have to cope with it.Third, the packaging is a MESS.  It looks nice, it opens like a book's folding cover and it has nice pictures, but the plastic holding the discs is a problem.  It's ridiculously hard to take a DVD out of its holder without breaking the disc or the holding plastic (the plastic holder for the first disc was already broken when we opened it).  Plus, the labeling on the discs is wrong.  My friend wanted to show me one of his favorite episodes first, #7, so after about three minutes of struggling, I managed to take the disc labeled ""7-10"" out of the package.  Once in the DVD player, we go to ""Episodes"" and it turns out the disc had episodes 8-11.  Then we put the disc back, took the disc labeled ""4-6"" and lo and behold, it contained episodes 5-7.In short, amazing show, awful transfer and bad packaging.  The show is worth it, even if they're only 13 episodes, but purchasing this particular collection we're making these people think it's OK to treat the customers with such disdain.",3,Five stars for the show - 1 star for the DVD,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,2267,"['show', 'was', 'released', 'HBO', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'watched', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'commercials', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'friend', 'mine', 'watched', 'though', 'loved', 'recommended', 'told', 'get', 'DVD', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'things', 'say', 'set.First', 'show', 'FANTASTIC', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'life', 'less-than-legal', 'side', 'jobs', 'Being', 'brazilian', 'production', 'quite', 'filled', 'nudity', 'theme', 'show', 'filled', 'violence', 'crimes', 'drug', 'use', 'sexual', 'exploits', 'etc', 'Definitely', 'not', 'children', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'appealing', 'specially', 'assure', 'quite', 'HILARIOUS.Second', 'DVD', 'quality', 'TERRIBLE', 'transfer', 'so', 'amateurish', ""'ll"", 'swear', 'was', 'bootleg', 'product', 'video', 'suffers', 'what', 'called', 'postage', 'stamping', 'instead', 'using', 'original', 'widescreen', 'ratio', 'used', 'one', 'was', 'transferred', 'fullscreen', 'TVs', 'transferred', 'back', 'widescreen', 'result', 'picture', 'smaller', 'fitting', 'black', 'box', 'TV', 'Zooming', 'picture', 'will', 'help', 'get', 'rid', 'black', 'bars', 'then', 'quality', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'lower', 'ridiculous', 'thing', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'cope', 'it.Third', 'packaging', 'MESS', 'nice', 'book', 'folding', 'cover', 'nice', 'pictures', 'plastic', 'holding', 'discs', 'problem', 'ridiculously', 'hard', 'take', 'DVD', 'holder', 'breaking', 'disc', 'holding', 'plastic', 'plastic', 'holder', 'first', 'disc', 'was', 'already', 'broken', 'when', 'opened', 'labeling', 'discs', 'wrong', 'friend', 'wanted', 'show', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'first', '7', 'so', 'three', 'minutes', 'struggling', 'managed', 'take', 'disc', 'labeled', '7-10', 'package', 'Once', 'DVD', 'player', 'go', 'Episodes', 'out', 'disc', 'had', 'episodes', '8-11', 'Then', 'put', 'disc', 'back', 'took', 'disc', 'labeled', '4-6', 'lo', 'behold', 'contained', 'episodes', '5-7.In', 'short', 'amazing', 'show', 'awful', 'transfer', 'bad', 'packaging', 'show', 'even', ""'re"", 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'purchasing', 'particular', 'collection', ""'re"", 'making', 'people', 'think', 'OK', 'treat', 'customers', 'such', 'disdain']",Mandrake: Season 1 & 2
1429858,ADBAJLF1ZJ0TB,B004V2S4Z6,Mikey,"[6, 6]","Mandrake is a drama series consisting of 13 episodes each around 45 minutes in length. Mandrake is a lawyer in Rio de Janeiro although in most situations he acts really as a negotiator for his clients. There's alot of sex, violence, nudity and drugs in this programme so it may not suit all tastes.I had never seen a Brazilian TV series before with English subtitles so this was a first for me. It certainly isn't perfect but it is certainly a good effort. The language spoken is Brazilian Portuguese and all episodes have English subtitles as an option.Lots of shots of downtown Rio, and the stunning Copacabana and Ipanema beaches makes you want to jump on a plane and head straight there!Produced in association with HBO, it's worth a try and for around GBP12 or less is certainly worth the spend.If Mandrake can't get you out of a fix in Rio, then nobody can!With the Olympics in 2016 and World Cup in 2014, I hope to be able to find some more Brazilian drama similar to this one.Enjoy!",4,Interesting Brazilian drama from 2005,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,990,"['Mandrake', 'drama', 'series', 'consisting', '13', 'episodes', '45', 'minutes', 'length', 'Mandrake', 'lawyer', 'Rio', 'Janeiro', 'most', 'situations', 'really', 'negotiator', 'clients', 'alot', 'sex', 'violence', 'nudity', 'drugs', 'programme', 'may', 'not', 'suit', 'tastes.I', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Brazilian', 'TV', 'series', 'English', 'subtitles', 'so', 'was', 'first', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'certainly', 'good', 'effort', 'language', 'spoken', 'Brazilian', 'Portuguese', 'episodes', 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'option.Lots', 'shots', 'downtown', 'Rio', 'stunning', 'Copacabana', 'Ipanema', 'beaches', 'want', 'jump', 'plane', 'head', 'straight', 'there', 'Produced', 'association', 'HBO', 'try', 'GBP12', 'less', 'certainly', 'worth', 'spend.If', 'Mandrake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'fix', 'Rio', 'then', 'nobody', 'can', 'Olympics', '2016', 'World', 'Cup', '2014', 'hope', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'more', 'Brazilian', 'drama', 'similar', 'one.Enjoy']",Mandrake: Season 1 & 2
