If you've never watched this show, you're in for an extended treat. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast Tony Soprano, the thinking man's gangster, with the reality of the life he has been born to and, quite frankly, would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage, and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter out of the jar, and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a Sunday afternoon of viewing NFL football.  Even Carmella, his wife, when given a chance for a way out, finds that she really prefers life with Tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own. If you followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. If you didn't, trust me you've never seen a TV show end like this.I'm looking forward to seeing all 86 episodes together over a short time period versus the very annoying long time periods between seasons that we had after the first three seasons.

The series, of course, brilliantly broke all the rules and paved the way for a grade of high-quality (i.e., non-network) television that, in spite of its speed in production, is superior to many movies. The stories are exceptionally well written; the directors knew how to use cameras to tell them; the acting was uniformly superlative.

I feel about this set the way I feel about the Godfather Trilogy being rereleased: I love the first 2/3 and I like the newer DVD extras so I guess I can deal with that abomination known as GF 3 (in the Sopranos case, Season 6 and 6.2 and isolated throwaway episodes in other seasons). The Sopranos also demonstrates that any good TV drama should wrap it up in about five seasons. I truly think that had the writers tightened up Season 4 more, the series could've ended in five seasons as being the greatest show of all-time. But because of Season 6 and 6.2 (which had isolated genius but nothing to the level of the first five), my opinion of the show is jaded.However, if you don't have any of the seasons (or even if you do) I still recommend you buy it for the Blu-Ray quality and the new Sopranos extras.",4,"Overall, a great value",1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,952,"['HBO', 'rip', 'off', 'customers', 'DVDs', '86', 'episodes', 'even', 'only', '60-65', 'are', 'actually', 'worth', 'watching', 'paying', '280', ""n't"", 'bad', 'feel', 'set', 'way', 'feel', 'Godfather', 'Trilogy', 'being', 'rereleased', 'love', 'first', '2/3', 'like', 'newer', 'DVD', 'extras', 'so', 'guess', 'can', 'deal', 'abomination', 'known', 'GF', '3', 'Sopranos', 'case', 'Season', '6', '6.2', 'isolated', 'throwaway', 'episodes', 'other', 'seasons', 'Sopranos', 'also', 'good', 'TV', 'drama', 'should', 'wrap', 'up', 'about', 'five', 'seasons', 'truly', 'think', 'had', 'writers', 'tightened', 'up', 'Season', '4', 'more', 'series', 'could', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'five', 'seasons', 'being', 'greatest', 'show', 'all-time', 'Season', '6', '6.2', 'had', 'isolated', 'genius', 'nothing', 'level', 'first', 'five', 'opinion', 'show', 'jaded.However', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'seasons', 'even', 'do', 'still', 'recommend', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'quality', 'new', 'Sopranos', 'extras']",N/A

1113207,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B000X410IY,D. C. Obraztsov,"[2, 3]","It's been nearly five years since The Sopranos ended, and with some of the new critically acclaimed television shows out there like Breaking Bad, I often wondered, ""are these shows overshadowing The Sopranos?""  I couldn't quite remember.  So I revisited the series by re-watching it with my boyfriend (who has never seen it), and I can safely say that The Sopranos is as good as I remember it and more.  It's one of the most thought-provoking shows in television history and truly captures the essence of people.  It's dark.  It's gritty.  People don't live happily ever after.  Everything is grey; nothing is black and white.  It's unpredictable, brutal, and thoroughly engaging.  Even though the show is probably less than 5% violence, the dialogue is so amazing and authentic that you can't stop watching.  My boyfriend tends to like dramas that have some action in them.  I was worried due to the slow-paced nature of The Sopranos and the fact that it's not much violence he may not enjoy it as much I do, but I was wrong.  He loved it.  And although the violence is sparse, when it happens, it HAPPENS, and it can be brutally twisted and disturbing. There are scenes from this show that still haunt me.  It's also satisfying, because sometimes the build-up is there for so long.  Chase never rushes things.  It's paced perfectly.  If you are intelligent and patient, I can't imagine that you wouldn't enjoy this show.  David Chase doesn't hand things to you on a silver platter, however.  So much is open to interpretation and even to this day, he still won't elaborate on much.Some people say that Mad Men is the best television show in history now.  After seeing it all, I have to wholeheartedly disagree.  The Sopranos never tried to be ""slick.""  It was just so beautifully and masterfully written that it WAS slick.  It WAS awesome.  And it didn't try.  It was so good that it just WAS.  A show like Mad Men is constantly trying to make a point.  Always trying to shove symbolism down your throat.  Great show, but The Sopranos manages to do all of this without spoon-feeding it to you. Chase uses symbolism, but it is very artfully done and subtle.  Dream sequences happen sometimes, but they are quite rare and I found them very interesting.The Sopranos is unforgiving.  Sadly, yet realistically, things don't always turn out peachy.  Actually, they usually don't.  It's as if David Chase created these characters and they took a life of their own.  There is no good or evil.  The characters all have flaws, and viewers can find reasons to love/hate any of them.  You'll find yourself throughout the series becoming attached to mobsters who kill people on a regular basis.  It's fascinating how much these people are relatable on a human level, regardless of their brutal occupation.The acting is just out of this world.  Part of it has to do with the amazing script they have, but the actors are definitely the cream of the crop.  James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano is one of the best acting performances I've ever seen in my life.  Once you get to know him, it's almost like an old friend.  You can tell by just the expressions on his face or his mannerisms of what he's most likely thinking or feeling.  The fact that he was not awarded every Golden Globe/Emmy he's been nominated for is just disturbing.  A performance like this one is so incredibly rare.  The rest of the cast is also superb.  Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano was the perfect casting decision.  It's not so easy playing a Jersey mob housewife as you may think.  She has as many layers as all the other characters.  Every role in this show is a challenge.  Michael Imperioli is another out-of-this-world performer in this show.  I have never seen anyone who could play such a convincingly high character.  You always knew when he was on drugs.  Joey Pants was in this as well as Ralph Cifaretto, and I don't know if I've ever seen such a convincing psychopathic, unstable character like this one.  He is just out of his mind crazy scary, and Joey Pants is flawless.I watched this show at quite a young age.  I was probably about 14 when I started watching during the middle of it.  I don't even remember why I started watching it or how I got into it, but once I started - I couldn't stop.  A lot of people think this show is too graphic/violent or morbid for younger people.  However, I feel like I learned a great deal about people watching this show.  It was an amazing analysis and insight into the human psyche, and its grittiness and realism was shocking to me.  It really changed my perspective on life and people in general.  It woke me up and had me seeing things in a different light.  And that's what powerful television shows and movies can do to you; they become a part of you and how you evolve and see things.  I am definitely inspired by this show and have re-watched it several times.  It never gets old.The Sopranos is so good that I actually feel honored to be able to watch it.  Art like this doesn't come around often, so take advantage of the fact that it exists and watch it.  You won't be disappointed.",5,Every episode is like an hour of the best movie ever.,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,5103,"['been', 'nearly', 'five', 'years', 'Sopranos', 'ended', 'new', 'critically',

1113208,A20Q4HD6A2B8W9,B000X410IY,Dennis Brandt,"[2, 4]","This review is on the series only, not this DVD set.I cannot recall becoming as engrossed in a TV series as I did the Sopranos.  Never being an HBO subscriber, I came to it late, watching all of the shows within the last two months thanks to Netflix.  Seasons 1 and 6 were Blu-ray, but none of the rest are yet available in that format.  The acting was superior up and down the cast and the scripts were always interesting.  The characters' constant use of malaprops was downright hysterical, and I still laugh about the ""16 Czechoslovakians"" the ""interior decorator"" Russian soldier killed.I wish that writers had not left some themes hanging.  The bear sequence led nowhere.  My favorite episode was Paulie and Christopher chasing the Russian in the Jersey Pine Barrens, but we never found out what happened to the Russian or who stole Paulie's Caddy.  The most glaring undeveloped theme was Melfi's rape.  You just knew Tony was going to avenge it, but it never happened.  In fact, that event went almost nowhere.  What, therefore, was the point?  Perhaps writers have something for Tony to do if they ever reprise the show.  (On a personal note, I wish Paulie had been popped.  If anyone deserved killing, it was he.  Aida Turturro's fine acting made me want to see her dead, too - like 100 times.)Thank goodness the producers did not sell it to Fox as they originally attempted.  On HBO, they not only could make longer shows, they were not forced to limit them to an exact time frame.  Shows were roughly an hour in length, but I noted at least one last that was 1:15.  Neither did the scripts need multiple mini-climaxes per episode as lead-ins to commerical breaks.  Scripts could be far more earthy and move at a slower and less artificial pace.I would strongly recommend this series to anyone except for . . .The foul language, which went WAY over the top.  Delete 75% of it, and you still have a lot of cursing.  Worse, it was the most offensive and personal type.  That the wise guys swore at each other is one thing.  That their wives would sit in the middle of a restaurant and toss F bombs all over the place is another matter.  That even the wise guys would go into public and drop F bombs to, or in the presence of, total strangers and bring attention to themselves is difficult to believe.  That Tony would sit down with a psychiatrist and on day one toss the word around promiscuously is also difficult to swallow.  Dramatically, the cursing soon meant nothing.  Had it been used less frequently, it would have had a greater dramatic impact when it was needed.The violence, of course, will put off others, as will the nudity and rather graphic sex scenes.  (My wife would never watch the Sopranos regardless of how good it is.)  If you can past the nudity, drug use, violence, and swearing, there is little of TV that ever has been this good.",5,Special TV with a few concerns,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,2861,"['review', 'series', 'only', 'not', 'DVD', 'set.I', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'becoming', 'engrossed', 'TV', 'series', 'did', 'Sopranos', 'Never', 'being', 'HBO', 'subscriber', 'came', 'late', 'watching', 'shows', 'last', 'two', 'months', 'thanks', 'Netflix', 'Seasons', '1', '6', 'were', 'Blu-ray', 'none', 'rest', 'are', 'yet', 'available', 'format', 'acting', 'was', 'superior', 'up', 'cast', 'scripts', 'were', 'always', 'interesting', 'characters', 'constant', 'use', 'malaprops', 'was', 'downright', 'hysterical', 'still', 'laugh', '16', 'Czechoslovakians', 'interior', 'decorator', 'Russian', 'soldier', 'killed.I', 'wish', 'writers', 'had', 'not', 'left', 'themes', 'hanging', 'bear', 'sequence', 'led', 'nowhere', 'favorite', 'episode', 'was', 'Paulie', 'Christopher', 'chasing', 'Russian', 'Jersey', 'Pine', 'Barrens', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Russian', 'who', 'stole', 'Paulie', 'Caddy', 'most', 'glaring', 'undeveloped', 'theme', 'was', 'Melfi', 'rape', 'just', 'knew', 'Tony', 'was', 'going', 'avenge', 'never', 'happened', 'fact', 'event', 'went', 'almost', 'nowhere', 'What', 'therefore', 'was', 'point', 'Perhaps', 'writers', 'have', 'something', 'Tony', 'do', 'ever', 'reprise', 'show', 'personal', 'note', 'wish', 'Paulie', 'had', 'been', 'popped', 'anyone', 'deserved', 'killing', 'was', 'Aida', 'Turturro', 'fine', 'acting', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'dead', 'too', '100', 'times', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'sell', 'Fox', 'originally', 'attempted', 'HBO', 'not', 'only', 'could', 'make', 'longer', 'shows', 'were', 'not', 'forced', 'limit', 'exact', 'time', 'frame', 'Shows', 'were', 'roughly', 'hour', 'length', 'noted', 'least', 'one', 'last', 'was', '1:15', 'did', 'scripts', 'need', 'multiple', 'mini-climaxes', 'episode', 'lead-ins', 'commerical', 'breaks', 'Scripts', 'could', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'earthy', 'move', 'slower', 'less', 'artificial', 'pace.I', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', '.The', 'foul', 'language', 'went', 'WAY', 'top', 'Delete', '75', '%', 'still', 'have', 'lot', 'cursing', 'Worse', 'was', 'most', 'offensive', 'personal', 'type', 'wise', 'swore', 'other', 'one', 'thing', 'wives', 'would', 'sit', 'middle', 'restaurant', 'toss', 'F', 'place', 'matter', 'even', 'wise', 'guys', 'would', 'go', 'public', 'drop', 'F', 'bombs', 'presence', 'total', 'strangers', 'bring', 'attention', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Tony', 'would', 'sit', 'down', 'psychiatrist', 'day', 'one', 'toss', 'word', 'promiscuously', 'also', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'Dramatically', 'cursing', 'soon', 'meant', 'nothing', 'Had', 'been', 'used', 'less', 'frequently', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'greater', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'when', 'was', 'needed.The', 'violence', 'course', 'will', 'put', 'off', 'others', 'will', 'nudity', 'rather', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'wife', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'Sopranos', 'regardless', 'how', 'good', 'can', 'past', 'nudity', 'drug', 'use', 'violence', 'swearing', 'little', 'TV', 'ever', 'been', 'good']",N/A

It has all of the 86 episodes as well as extras, including separate discs with the soundtracks and special features including roundtable talks with the actors about the show. There are also lost scenes and an in-depth interview with the creator David Chase. If there is a downside to this set it is that the discs slide into cardboard pouches and may be susceptible to scratches, though this didn't seem to be a problem for me. This is a solid and very heavy cardboard book that has the grave look of a tombstone, or coffin.I think what makes this show so great is that it shows different perceptions of life, and despite the fact that it focuses on a mobster's life, what makes it pertinent is that the show is about how an American family tries to cope with daily life. The show takes us from the very dark, to the reflective, from the highs to the lows, with all of life's undulations. The scene in the last episode with Tony (James Gandolfini) raking the leaves around the pool under the overcast sky, isolated as he is, surrounded by the bare withered branches of the encroaching woods, just going about his business, waiting patiently possibly for his assassins (or death) to come and take his life, says so much about his disposition, his outlook on life.

Even knowing they are primarily murderers, thieves and generally not very nice people, we get to see them as though they are ordinary people whose lives we're allowed to enter, to understand and  sympathize with them, are horrified too, and very drawn into their problems.  But the purchase I made recently was a gift to my wonderful neighbor, Mike, a remarkable young man who has been so helpful and kind to me and is consistently so over the past few years.  Mike talked about the program often and wished he could have the entire series, so with this  special gift, he can now enjoy it any time he wants.  Do buy it, as I did, for yourselves, and for anyone else who enjoyed the series.  It's a perfect story filled with love, tension, marital discord, fear and conflict, and even horror.

1113217,A1D7D7FXQTQQTV,B000X410IY,Gladius,"[1, 2]","I watched the series from beginning to end in about a year.  Very good overall.  The acting (most everyone), writing (Mafia but with same family problems we all have --- at first, at least, then too many problems), plot (having a mob boss like Tony see a shrink was near genius), and humor (Paulie and Chris getting lost and nearly dying when trying to kill a Russian Mafioso in the woods was priceless) made for a really good series but it should have been even better.  (Only ""The Sopranos"" could get away with a talking fish telling Tony who the FBI was speaking to.)By season 3, some of the fun began to wear off.  For example, Malfi became boring.(Tony would want to sleep with this non-smiling, monotone woman when gorgeous women, sometimes inexplicably, were attracted to all 360lbs of his drug dealing self?).In Season 5, the shows were all over the place (and I was sorry to see Furio gone).  Many seeming plot set ups were never followed through on.  And everyone who worked for/with Tony seemed to die or go to prison; most everyone but Tony.  They were a dysfunctional mob family at best with killings of the best earners, power plays every week, personal problems galore, and yet they were successful  (Tony gets a private plane to Vegas since he is boss of a ""glorified crew?"" --- true, the NY families were much bigger).  Additionally, I think this is when the show started to have too many dream sequences --- e.g., when Tony had amnesia and was mistaken for someone else.  Another bad episode was when Tony had a gambling problem all of a sudden which disappeared as quickly as it came and added nothing to the show.In Season 6, why would  I want several episodes devoted to a Captain being gay or an old mobster getting senile?  Were the writers worn out?  Out of ideas?  Waiting for the end?  Was the last season made just to make some extra bucks for everyone?It was either two years too long or the writers/directors got carried away and bored.  A shame.The ending?  The final five minutes did not bother me despite the director having some fun at the audience's expense.I really liked Tony, Bobby, Chris, and Johnny Sacks (only he stood up to Tony).  I grew to dislike Carmela (money-mad) and Malfi (half dead and boring --- see her in GoodFellas for a much better performance and a bit of sexiness).  I guess some of the women in the show seemed to give me a problem.  I did, however, admire the beauty of some of the women (such as Tony's Las Vegas girlfriend --- the one he did mushrooms with.  I wanted to see more of her --- in more ways than one).  ""I did it"" he screamed.  I heard people tried to figure out what this meant.  I say it meant nothing --- he was on drugs after all and it's just a TV show.I'm from NYC originally and I know NJ.  Yes, NJ is mostly ugly/crowded although there are many upscale communities.  Yes, there is corruption.  I ate at the sushi place and recognized other places (no, the sushi is much better in Manhattan than at that place).  I had no problem with the depiction of NJ.A very good series and I identified with several characters.  Tony's dead eyes were perfect for a mob boss.

As someone who had never seen a single episode before buying this set, I'm already satisfied that I will enjoy the entire series after watching just the first three episodes.The video quality is terrific- no longing for Blu-Ray for me. The picture is near hi-def (as good as any cable hi-def with a good upscaler/player) and looks fantastic on my 50"" plasma.Few reviewers mentioned that this set also includes the three soundtrack discs that are also sold separately. This was a nice bonus, as the music on each is good stuff and not much of it overlaps with my somewhat eclectic collection.Finally-- the price is coming down for the holiday sales crunch, and this set can be had at a very attractive price, I got mine at Costco at a steal, which made the choice to buy a no-brainer. Even at the current standard street price, I would say that fans of the show would be perfectly happy, and any of those outsiders like me, who were considering catching up on this acclaimed show one day, would really enjoy it as well.PS- I'm not sure what the fuss about closed-captioning was about, unless it was based on pirated copies, but they are included on my set-- I've already used them on occasion to catch some of the famous slang that I otherwise couldn't decipher.

1113233,ANQPAVUV1A1YC,B000X410IY,K. Golik,"[7, 8]","The Sopranos is one of American Television's landmark series and this box set contains all 86 episodes.There is no doubt that the actual episodes there makes it 5-star material but lets judge the box set in itself.The actual box set is neat and well crafted and is a great coffee table display along side my Seinfeld box set. It is great packaging and in scrapbook formation  that makes it awesome. The scrapbook comes in a cloth sleeve which is phenomonal and the book is sweet just like the Sex and the City set.The Bonus Materials on this set is solid, its not earth shattering but not bad either. The soundtrack is really really good. A nice mix, my favorite mix is the Mr. Ruggerio's Mix of The Peter Gunn Theme/Every Breathe You Take (Henry Mancini and The Police). The soundtrack is 3 discs. The 2 DVDs contain the bonus materials. The David Chase Interview is awesome. The dinners between cast members Adia Turturro, Robert Iler, Terence Winter, David Chase in one and Edie Falco, Steven Van Zandt, David Chase, and others in another are very slow but worth watching. The let down for me was the Deleted Scenes I figured there were be some real nice alternate endings but most of them are pointless, none though are earth shattering and worth discussion. One comes from Season One from the pilot and its Tony ranting about John Gotti and F*** Rudy Guiliani.Finally in this scrapbook there is a 16-page episode guy built in. Gives a little synopsis of the episodes. Also before each season there is a contents of the epidsodes that are on each disc which helps a lot.Bottomline: I would not spend $400 on this box set, not in a million years. I paid $140 at FYE for it I traded in my Sopranos sets I had which is a good economy route. If you know a Sopranos fanatic this is a GREAT gift! If you are a Sopranos fan this is a great piece to your DVD collection and would find a way to make this purchase. The bottom line is this set is essential to any diehard Sopranos fan.

1113235,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B000X410IY,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 0]","The Sopranos wasn't the first attempt to make a television series on the level of serious cinema, but it was the first one where all the elements came together successfully. Free of commercials, the HBO format allowed the creators to give the viewer credit for the ability to follow the multiple parallel and intersecting storylines, going beyond the typical plot and subplot structure of other series. Episodes often had as many as six different storylines of various lengths. Greater demands were made on the audience's intelligence and attention span than in any prior series.The subject matter itself was unheard of. We had seen the Italian Mafia before, in &#34;The Godfather,&#34; &#34;Goodfellas,&#34; &#34;Donnie Brasco,&#34; &#34;Casino,&#34; and countless others, but in all of them, these people may as well have been Martians. Their world barely resembled our own. Tony Soprano, on the other hand, could be your next-door neighbor. Your children could be attending school with A.J. and Meadow. This world wasn't comfortably distant - it was in our living room - it could be our living room. The psychoanalysis element added a meta-layer of introspection. Tony, a brutal, ruthless man from an insular and violent tradition, is experiencing the stress caused by his position as a human being making a living in an inhuman business. In this way, he's not that different from the former advertising executive in Studs Terkel's &#34;Working,&#34; who could no longer stay in that industry once he became aware of its soul-killing and destructive identity. But for various reasons - tradition, honor - Tony cannot leave. Also, it's obvious that at times, he truly enjoys what he does. One question the series raises is whether &#34;talk therapy&#34; is of any value at all. Tony does not appear to change over the course of the series, despite countless hours with Dr. Melfi. She quickly realizes that she probably cannot help Tony, but treating a Mafia kingpin is too exciting to drop, especially after her friends and family figure out who her patient is.In one scene, Carmela has her own session with a therapist, who unequivocally advises her to take the kids and leave. This man is clear that making money from bloodshed is evil. But Carmela does not leave - she can't imagine living without the income Tony brings in, and besides, where is she supposed to go? Everyone makes money the way Tony does, just not as obviously.Not to say that &#34;The Sopranos&#34; didn't have a few dud episodes or even a season that wasn't up to par. It wasn't as tightly constructed as &#34;Six Feet Under&#34; that followed it; a series that maintained the same outstanding level from start to finish. But without &#34;The Sopranos,&#34; &#34;Six Feet Under&#34; and many other shows of the &#34;Golden Age of Dramatic Television&#34; in the 2000s, would not have been possible.The main letdown of &#34;The Sopranos&#34; was the ending. It was not a surrealistic art project, where an ambiguous ending would have been appropriate. Its hyper-realism demanded a clear expository finish, like Claire Fisher in the final scene of &#34;Six Feet Under,&#34; driving across the desert while we flash forward to the future deaths of the main characters. Maybe that was too much to ask, but it was not unreasonable to expect David Chase to actually write a conclusion to the series. The family was in a diner; it was close enough to the end of the first season when they were stranded in &#34;Vesuvio,&#34; but together as a family. That would have been a &#34;happy&#34; ending. The sudden dark silence suggested Tony's death; although Tony was certainly the main character, we were not &#34;him.&#34; The series could have continued without him. The assumption was that a gunman killed Tony, Carmela, and A.J. right in front of Meadow as she entered the diner. Chase didn't want to show this to us; he wanted us to imagine it, but I could hear the groans across America as the screen went black of &#34;that's it?&#34;I've since read a shot-by-shot analysis of the series' final scene, where the writer concludes that the final darkness does in fact represent Tony's death. The last scene alternates between shots of Tony's face, and Tony's point of view (POV) as people come into the diner. Several clues suggest that the man at the counter in the Members Only jacket shoots Tony in the back of the head on his way out of the bathroom. The black screen is Tony's final POV of the absolute silence and darkness of death. This conclusion follows Chase's statement in an interview that everything the audience needs to figure out the final shot is contained within the scene, and throughout the entire series. So it makes sense if he wanted the audience to have to work for the ending instead of having it spelled out for them.The ending may have been a disappointment, but it didn't detract from the series as a whole. The message that civilization is a thin veneer over the evil going on in front of and all around us, is timeless. &#34;The Sopranos&#34; wasn't the first drama to present this, but it was the first one to show it on television, and its greatest legacy was to raise the medium to a new level. It's worth seeing just for this.",5,Reinventing television,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,5230,"['Sopranos', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'attempt', 'make', 'television', 'series', 'level', 'serious',

1113264,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B000X410IY,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[6, 9]","This is the finest DVD series set I have seen so far. The set is very well made and they have gone out of their way to keep it that way. After opening the outer case you'll find a velvet bag around the book the DVD are held in, the whole thing being kept safely in place by inserted pieces of styrofoam to insure safe arrivial to whoever purchases them. Aside from that there is the ribbon for removal and another styrofoam insert placed in the spine of the large book itself to keep it further protected. All the discs in the book are placed in neatly with their labels faced properly and none of mine had any scratches. I give this set and obviously this series itself 10 stars each. That said I want to comment on something in the other reviews.True alot of people have stated how incredibly nice this set is, yet I keep seeing reviews from alot of others complaining about the set. I obviously really like this set, it is the nicest thing on my shelf and probably will be for quite a while. I think people are complaining because they don't understand what they bought. This set is for people who don't mind taking care of it as long as it's a nice expensive set they can appreciate, which it is.In referring to issues raised in other reviews I'll address most remarks and discount them right away as being from people who just don't want to shell out for this set and already bought the previous seasons, that's fine guys and I'm sorry but this happens. Aside from those of us who didn't mind shelling out for such a nice set there are also all the people who are fans of the series who haven't bought it yet and this is the best option for them. You guys didn't want to buy a really nice car to take care of and show, you were fine with getting from point A to B with the car's you already had, that's fine but don't discount the set for that.Aside from those remarks and reviews there are the others of legitimate concern over the packaging not being the best in terms of storing the DVD themselves and various claims that the set will wear too much over time. Well I am the most anal retentitive person I have ever met when it comes to DVD, the slightest dent on a box or scratch on a disc and I will return the set as faulty, if I'm paying upward of forty dollars I want my money's worth. I am here to say bottom line that I hold none of those conerns when it comes to the quality of this set. I was discouraged before I opened mine on Christmas because so many negative reviews had gotten to me but none of the discs were scratched and nothing came dented, torn or anything. Maybe I was just lucky, certainly a few customer's must've recieved faulty sets as happens with anything and I'm sorry for them. However, alot of others seem to be blaming the maker's of the set for something that isn't there fault.In my set the ribbon never came undone, possibly because I didn't tug away at it rather I eased the book out of the box with complete care. The discs have been in and out repetitively since Christmas and none have scratched in the slightest way, possibly because I am reasonably careful and any lint or dust that is on them as result of transfering from one spot to another I lightly wipe off from inner to outer edge in proper fashion. Also I lightly lift the disc off the inner sleeve pressing the labeled side of it against the outer sleeve until it is slid to the bottom when I set it into it's place. In saying that it's not like it takes ten minutes to remove a disc or that I'm using tweezer's and rubber gloves, I am just taking appropriate care. The book itself I keep outside the storage box because it looks nicer set up on my shelf the way I have it and it makes it easier to get at the discs. The pages that some complain are already wearing at the seems and will worsen over time, mine have not worn and I can say will not excessively over time either, possibly because I carefully turn the pages and hold the heavy side of the book while doing it to keep the weight from straining the pages, this isn't a three ringed folder or five star note book built to withstand any amount of wear and tear but it is well made, serves it's purpose and when handled appropriately should keep until the day I expire.The set is only going to keep as well as you handle it, if you are rough with it what do you expect, that doesn't mean it is poorly made. Our bodies are well made but if we were always throwing ourselves down flights of stairs we would get some broken bones, or if we slid our fingers over a knife blade they would get cut that doesn't mean our bodies aren't well made. Everything is built to be handled a certain way.I believe that those complaining were either more unlucky than I with the sets they recieved or more likely most of them aren't so much showing concern for their sets but more over laziness on the part of their care of them. A set like this that cost two hundred dollars isn't supposed to simply serve it's purpose, though that's nice, it's supposed to be high quality. It's like having a nice expensive car, if you keep a cover on it and drive it appropriately and take care when handling it then you won't scratch it and there will be no forseeable damage. That's what you have to do with this set.The set could have been made a hundred different ways but this is how they made it and personally I can't imagine it looking better than it does at the same time as serving it's purpose. They couldn't have done it the same with the plastic storage containers, and on that note these cardboard sleeves everyone is so mad about are not 'cardboard' sleeves when compared to other sets (like the dreadful Simpsons Season 11 which might as well have been sold between two old pieces of a cardboard pizza box), the pages are indeed made of fine doubled up bonded cardboard but the actual DVD sleeves themselves have a well smoothed back edge specifically to keep discs from scratching. This set is designed so that if you take care there will be no more scratches to your discs resulting over time than there would be in the handling of any other set from laying them on DVD Player Trays or placing them in their plastic holders.This set is beautiful and made for those of us who want to drive an expensive car and want to take care of it just for the sake of owning such a nice well made car. Anyone who doesn't like taking the time for things like that and would rather have a regular car that takes less time to care for but still gets them from point A to point B should buy the individual sets. There is nothing wrong with that or with buying this one as long as you accept the wear and tear 'you' cause, don't blame it on the maker's of the set just because it isn't perfectly designed for every single person's needs in lowest common denominator fashion. That's like buying a book and being mad at the maker's of the book when you give yourself a paper cut while turning the pages because they aren't printed on Special Ed. class circle paper.Thanks For

1113280,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B000X410IY,Wesley Mullins,"[196, 222]","Meet Tony Soprano. He sleeps until noon, has a boyish sense of humor, and enjoys old war movies on The History Channel.  He has two high maintenance children, a more high maintenance wife, and he grew up with a controlling mother so manipulative he has to see a psychiatrist to deal with his depression and panic attacks.And in his spare time, he runs a middling outfit of La Cosa Nostra and controls most of the organized crime in North New Jersey.This is the set-up for the show that superseded all its predecessors and took its place at the pinnacle of television artistry. Creator David Chase's masterpiece follows Tony is his travels through his three worlds: family, work and therapy. The plot arcs are simultaneously short and long-ranging, as resolution is found in each episode and also builds toward season climaxes and long-reaching series payoffs.  The end result is a television show with the grand scope of a novel, but one that doesn't forget to keep viewers interested with weekly rewards.Probably the only series in history with more Emmy nominations (112) than episodes (86), The Sopranos has been called the greatest show ever to appear on television, the pioneer for all current successful pay cable programs and the most influential piece of pop culture over the last quarter century.  In this day where novels have lost their broad appeal and 90 minute films paint on a limited canvas, Tony Soprano is destined to be the most studied and analyzed literary figure over the next few decades.Such critical focus is not unjustified.  As much as the series hinges on the many supporting characters, the show IS Tony. Women love him, men fear him and viewers are captivated by all his complexities. James Gandolfini dazzles in his performance as one of the greatest characters ever seen on stage, television or film, a man without faith in god or country, and a man whose own allegiance to both his literal and figurative families is at best tepid.  Often, his inconsistent and unpredictable behavior leaves audiences confused until he lays himself open in his therapist's office, scenes that are sometimes uncomfortable to watch because of the degree of vulnerability Gandolfini allows Tony to reach.The notoriously naughty drama contains the sex and violence consistent with an examination of the mafia, but also provides its share of tenderness.  Although a habitual philanderer, Tony aspires to be a great husband, father, brother, and son, but too often he lacks the strength or skills to care about anyone but himself.  His longing for a modest normal life leaks into his dreams and therapy and illuminates a man who hates what he sees in the mirror but can't do anything about it.With a few hundred words, this review does not do justice to the monumental achievement.  An entire piece could be written about the show's black comedy, culinary artistry, or exploration of familial roles.  The Sopranos routinely tackled difficult subjects like caring for the elderly, Italian-American defamation, religion, homosexuality, terrorism and the many flaws in the federal government.  Wrapped together with a soundtrack that's one part classic rock and one part 1960s Las Vegas, the Sopranos achieved the nearly impossible feat of being both the most entertaining/watchable show from its era and also the one that provided the most insight into the human condition and experience.
