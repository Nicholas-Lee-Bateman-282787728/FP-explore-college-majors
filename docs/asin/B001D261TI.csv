Rather complicated routine will keep the attention of those easily bored and looking for something more imaginative with less repetition.  Has cardio and weight segments, which I prefer.CONS:  As others noted, the routines seemed unnecessarily complicated and would have benefited from more repetitions and less switching around.  The challenge for me wasn't as much about stamina as keeping in step with all the changes.  While I was able to follow along the first time I watched this without feeling frustrated, I did wonder ""are all these changes really necessary?"" and had to pay close attention to the tv the whole time.  It felt like they do a move 4 times and then need to switch it up in some shape or form so if that's what you like, this is for you.  I'm sorry to say that the instructor just did not work out for me --- while it is actually a testimony to her being in great enough shape to talk non-stop, I must confess I ended up wondering if she'd ever give us a break and stop talking for 5 seconds.  Most of the time, the moves keep changing so she has to cue or count and during repetition moments she would talk about the muscles being worked or saying her catchphrase (which also didn't work for me) ""that's your move.""

Literally, dripping sweat at my computer, but it's worth it so that I may help others who are wondering about this video.This video is 40 minutes long and is considered one of their Cardio & Sculpt because of the incorporation of weights and power moves that increase your heart rate.Like with all Firm videos (obviously I'm a big fan anyway) this video is well choreographed by Rebecca Sturkie, who is just awesome.  She has a great attitude and you can tell she's working right there along with you - and sweating with you too!!Every single move is modified for beginners, using no weights, as Rebecca points out at the beginning of the video, and you can still work up a sweat following Noel.Each set incorporates lower body and upper body work for ""maximum calorie burning"" as the Firm is so famous for saying, and they are right!I workout with a Heart Rate Monitor and was not surprised to see myself on the high end of my Zone 2, which is my fat burning zone, and where I want to be for most of my workouts.  This video, and most Firm videos, help me achieve that fat burning zone quickly and efficiently.This video definitely has a lot of squats, lunges and dips, so it's very, very important to watch your form, especially before you incorporate weights and before you add the arm work that always accompanies these.I really liked the power moves - Rebecca would choose a move and tell you how to modify it to help your heart rate climb and it's awesome and hard, but they are over very quickly!This will be a workout that I keep handy for my monthly rotations, especially because it's such a powerful workout for the amount of time.  I love Rebecca, I love the Firm and I love this workout.I'm a SAH and WAH mom, with a husband who works long hours, so these workouts have allowed me to change the shape of my body for the better!

She cues well and is not annoying like Ali Del Rio and Annie Lee. While doing this workout, I used 5 lbs weights throughout, and I wore a heart rate monitor. At the end of 40 minutes, my average heart rate was 140. Not great ( I average over 150 bpm when doing the Firm's 500 Calorie Workout) but enough to burn maybe 300 calories. The power moves are the best - my heart rate spiked into the 160's when doing these moves. They are tough!

1178383,AF59K96J7JESR,B001D261TI,LovesMusic,"[0, 1]","I am a big fan of the older Firm workouts. They're all no-nonsense, straight to the business of working out, lifting weights, and getting some cardio in while you're at it. The new Firms though? Such as this one? Hmmm I'm not really feeling them. I keep trying, and I keep wanting to like them, but they just ... well to me, they lack continuity and a feeling of being fluid. Exercises are changed out quickly, when really there's just no need to switch moves that often. To make matters worse, all of the segments seem to be performed to one, single, elevator music type instrumental song. I was about to mute the TV while doing the workout because I just couldn't take it a minute longer. Get some better music, Firm! In addition, the cardio isn't comparative in intensity to say a Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, or Jari Love workout. I think in recent years the Firm has fallen behind a bit when it comes to workouts that are fun and get results at the same time. I miss the days of Traci Long and Jen Carmen.

1178384,A2WHT2D8YWAM0A,B001D261TI,Lucal,"[7, 7]","First of all I am a huge Firm fan. I do a Firm workout 2-3 times per week. I have weighed less (in high school) but I wear smaller clothing than I have since I was about 12. The workouts like this one blow the gimmicky ones (like transfirmer step ones) out of the water in terms of intensity and results. My favorites are this one and the 500 Calorie workout.To get the best bang out of this (or any Firm) workout you will need 3, 5, & 8 pound hand weights. This one is a short but very effective 40 minutes long.I hate dancy-fancy aerobics. I just can't follow the moves. I was worried that this one would be too hard to follow. I was pleased to find quite the contrary. It was you basic core full body moves. A lot of dips, lunges, squats, etc. It also has ample weight work that made me SORE--and I do these workouts all the time. This one starts out slow, but don't be fooled. It builds and builds and builds. By the end I am dripping with sweat and can feel the lingering burn in my legs, butt and arms.The cons on this one: The music is not the best (usually I don't even notice the music--but this struck me as not what I wanted), her beginner is really a beginner and it can be distracting (but it is nice to see someone ""Real""), there are a couple points that she gets a little out of sync at the end, if you have bad knees this NOT a good idea.",5,Title says it all,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,1354,"['First', 'am', 'huge', 'Firm', 'fan', 'do', 'Firm', '2-3', 'times', 'week', 'have', 'weighed', 'less', 'high', 'school', 'wear', 'smaller', 'clothing', 'have', 'was', 'about', '12', 'workouts', 'one', 'blow', 'gimmicky', 'ones', 'transfirmer', 'step', 'ones', 'water', 'terms', 'intensity', 'results', 'favorites', 'are', 'one', '500', 'Calorie', 'workout.To', 'get', 'best', 'bang', 'Firm', 'will', 'need', '3', '5', '8', 'pound', 'hand', 'weights', 'one', 'short', 'very', 'effective', '40', 'minutes', 'long.I', 'hate', 'dancy-fancy', 'aerobics', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'moves', 'was', 'worried', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'follow', 'was', 'pleased', 'find', 'contrary', 'was', 'basic', 'core', 'full', 'body', 'moves', 'lot', 'dips', 'lunges', 'squats', 'etc', 'also', 'ample', 'weight', 'work', 'made', 'SORE', 'do', 'workouts', 'time', 'one', 'slow', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'builds', 'builds', 'end', 'am', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'can', 'feel', 'lingering', 'burn', 'legs', 'butt', 'arms.The', 'cons', 'one', 'music', 'not', 'best', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'music', 'struck', 'not', 'what', 'wanted', 'beginner', 'really', 'beginner', 'can', 'be', 'distracting', 'nice', 'see', 'someone', 'Real', 'are', 'couple', 'points', 'little', 'sync', 'end', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'NOT', 'good', 'idea']",The Firm: Get Chisel'd
1178385,A181YW6IJ89Q4L,B001D261TI,Lynna13,"[13, 16]","I got this DVD because of the good reviews. I usually use yoga or Jillian Michaels' DVDs, and I've never done a Firm workout before, so I have no idea how it stacks up to other Firm DVDs. However, I wasn't too impressed with it as an overall workout.I'm a straightforward kind of exerciser. I like a lot of bang for my buck, and I'd rather do tough, simple moves than a lot of fancy stuff that doesn't have as much of a pay off. To me, this DVD is a little too full of the latter. Especially with the warm-up--but in the workout as well--there are lots of ""step this way, move your arms over here while stepping back over there"" kind of moves. I felt like it was a lot of confusion just to get a decent sweat going, and I didn't think the cuing was close to being enough to sort things out for me.The other problem I had with this workout is that when there ARE straightforward moves (and there are several of these as well), the reps are way too low. I believe at one point you do four push-ups before she tries to make it all fancy again. That is just not enough for me to even begin to feel anything. I know that I would have gotten a better workout if we could have just done twenty regular push-ups. I felt the same way about several of the strength exercises here. She changes things up so often that I don't feel like I ever really pushed any one muscle group.There are some good things about this DVD. I did manage a sweat, which means it must be doing something. And some of the moves in the first few circuits were unique and I could feel them in my butt/thighs especially. The cardio blasts WILL get your heartrate up at least momentarily. And Rebekah is not overly annoying, though she does like to repeat herself a lot. However, I probably won't do this DVD much because I don't feel it really makes the most of my time, and I think it sacrifices effectiveness for frills at times.",3,Not one I'll be using a lot,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,1894,"['got', 'DVD', 'good', 'reviews', 'usually', 'use', 'yoga', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'Firm', 'workout', 'before', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'up', 'other', 'Firm', 'DVDs', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'overall', 'workout.I', ""'m"", 'straightforward', 'kind', 'exerciser', 'like', 'lot', 'bang', 'buck', ""'d"", 'rather', 'do', 'tough', 'simple', 'moves', 'lot', 'fancy', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'pay', 'off', 'DVD', 'little', 'too', 'full', 'latter', 'Especially', 'warm-up', 'workout', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'lots', 'step', 'way', 'move', 'arms', 'here', 'stepping', 'back', 'kind', 'moves', 'felt', 'was', 'lot', 'confusion', 'just', 'get', 'decent', 'sweat', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'cuing', 'was', 'close', 'being', 'enough', 'sort', 'things', 'out', 'me.The', 'other', 'problem', 'had', 'workout', 'when', 'ARE', 'straightforward', 'moves', 'are', 'several', 'well', 'reps', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'low', 'believe', 'one', 'point', 'do', 'four', 'push-ups', 'make', 'fancy', 'again', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'even', 'begin', 'feel', 'anything', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'workout', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'done', 'twenty', 'regular', 'push-ups', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'several', 'strength', 'here', 'things', 'up', 'so', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ever', 'really', 'pushed', 'one', 'muscle', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'DVD', 'did', 'manage', 'sweat', 'must', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'moves', 'first', 'few', 'circuits', 'were', 'unique', 'could', 'feel', 'butt/thighs', 'especially', 'cardio', 'blasts', 'WILL', 'get', 'heartrate', 'up', 'least', 'momentarily', 'Rebekah', 'not', 'overly', 'annoying', 'repeat', 'lot', 'However', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'DVD', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'most', 'time', 'think', 'effectiveness', 'frills', 'times']",The Firm: Get Chisel'd

1178400,A39MD3N21Z8OUU,B001D261TI,The Mrs.,"[5, 5]","I did this workout yesterday for the first time and while the workout itself is good and I was able to burn a lot of calories, I am not overly drawn to this DVD. It's not a bad workout, nor is the instructor, but I can say that this will be one only done occasionally vs often. I can't quite explain the feeling bc it worked me hard and the moves were varied, I just wasn't excited about it.The warm up is your first cardio cycle. There are approx 6 cycles total, 3 cardio, 3 with weights. On other sites this is ranked as an Intermediate DVD, I would say though it's closer to Inter/Advanced. There are a lot of high impact options that would give the advanced user a well rounded workout. Burpees are the only exercise in this DVD that I am unable to do. I have to wear a knee brace which takes all pressure off of my bad knee, thankfully as there are a lot of lunges and squats. However, the burpees call for a range of motion that I am not able to obtain with the brace on. If you have knee issues, you will find it best to stick to a more ""beginner"" option by not going down as deep.You complete your ast cycle on the floor which is strength/toning/abs. You get in some chest work along with abs and even a little balance challenge with side planks. You use your weights throughout the DVD including the floor work and Side Planks. Ab movements are nothing new to the firm and in fact, in this DVD, they seem to be a little easier on the back compared to other workouts like the 500 Calorie Burn. I swear I am the Bionic Woman as I have several old injuries throughout my body including the lower back. Ab work is tricky for me anyhow, so for the average person, the ab work would be decent, nothing too grueling. For ppl like me with lower back issues, you will find that you may have to modify some of the movements by doing a lesser range of motion. To challenge yourself for those of you with strong back, don't put the dummbells down, it'll intensify it.Compared to other Firm Pinks I was surprised that I had to lower my weight selection. In every other one I have had to increase it to meet my needs. I believe it is bc the pace of the DVD moves you quickly so in order to maintain proper form, it would need to be lowered. The Choreography is typical Firm Style as is instruction. Rebekah is a great lead and a wonderful cuer; I had no issues what-so-ever following along. A movement here or there I had to do a few times for it to flow easily, but nothing that would cause me issue. If I were to look at the choreography alone, it's a fun workout, so I have no clue why I am not drawn more into this. Perhaps doing it a couple of more times would help. I do love Total Body Time Crunch, so if you don't have that, it's really great! The music in this one isn't bad. I have watched a clip of the DVD before purchasing and the Music seemed so dreadful! I avoided getting it for so long bc of that alone. Really though the music sounds completely different, hearing it in it's intended form and not a few second shot, really makes the difference. You're in and out in 42-43 minutes and you get a great workout. This would make a wonderful Cardio-Only DVD if you stuck with 3s and/or 5 lbs weight only. I did this as I was not able to make it to the gym for my weight workout. I don't feel much today, a little soreness in the abs, left bicep/shoulder (another weak area thanks to injury), and a small section of my quads. At this point I know I couldn't go heavier bc of the pace, so for me personally I will use this as a cardio workout with light weights.It's not a bad DVD, but it's not my favorite or on the favorites list for the Firm. You will get worked out, sweat a lot (I was dripping), and it's worth the money. If you've seen a clip of the workout, those don't do it justice. I personally LOVE the 500 Calorie Burn, Total Body Toner, and Total Body Time Crunch. This is good, but there is just something about it that I can't quite put my finger on, which is why I rated it 4 instead of 5...I'd give it 4.5 if I could. I don't regret this purchase and would recommend it. It's one that will produce results and excellent gains in endurance.Look to youtube for 1-4 minute length clips of this DVD.EDIT: There is also a 15 minute Cardio-only add on for this DVD.
