They don't tell you that Elektra Luxx is the second part of the two-movie set. Too much 'Go woman power"" preachiness but it's a movie about a famous (fictious) porn star.

1428129,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004ULEEXY,DanD,"[9, 10]","Sebastian Gutierrez's ELEKTRA LUXX doesn't quite know what it wants to be.  It's a comedy, there's no doubt--there are some absolutely hilarious moments.  It's also an inspirational piece, and a character study, and a romance, and a study of aging and womanhood.  In these latter areas, it stumbles a bit, never reaching its full stride.The film revolves around retired porn star Elektra Luxx (Carla Gugino).  She's pregnant now and teaching a sex class for housewives, living a relatively quiet life.  One day, a woman (Marley Shelton) approaches her with a proposition: cheat with her boyfriend.  Shenanigans ensue, and Elektra slowly finds her place in life.  The film is framed/narrated/hosted by a porn blogger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).The cast is solid.  Carla Gugino is phenomenal, carrying the entire weight of the film on her shoulders.  Gordon-Levitt is hilarious, as is Timothy Olyphant as perhaps the one guy whom Elektra can love.  Olyphant and Gugino's scenes are the funniest in the film; too bad he's only in it for the blink of an eye.  The supporting roles are also solid (a grossly underused Kathleen Quinnan being the standout), and there is a funny/creepy/thoughtful cameo from an uncredited great actress (no spoilers).  Perhaps the most surprising thing is that the film manages to be sexy without being at all exploitative; a true wonder these days.  On the other hand, the script is a bit haphazard; there are too many subplots that meander too far from Elektra's story.  And Gordon-Levitt's character is inconsequential; the actor himself is hilarious, but his ""skits"" (for that's what they amount to) add nothing to the story as a whole.  The overall effect is a film that tries to do too much.  It's still absolutely funny in spots (again, kudos to Olyphant), and gives Gugino a chance to prove just how good she is.  But as a whole, ELEKTRA LUXX feels more like a collection of ""parts"" that never truly congeal.",3,Tries to do too much...but still very funny and thoughtful.,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,1938,"['Sebastian', 'Gutierrez', 'ELEKTRA', 'LUXX', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'comedy', 'doubt', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'also', 'inspirational', 'piece', 'character', 'study', 'romance', 'study', 'aging', 'womanhood', 'latter', 'areas', 'bit', 'never', 'reaching', 'full', 'stride.The', 'film', 'around', 'retired', 'porn', 'star', 'Elektra', 'Luxx', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'pregnant', 'now', 'teaching', 'sex', 'class', 'housewives', 'living', 'relatively', 'quiet', 'life', 'One', 'day', 'woman', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'proposition', 'cheat', 'boyfriend', 'Shenanigans', 'ensue', 'Elektra', 'slowly', 'place', 'life', 'film', 'framed/narrated/hosted', 'porn', 'blogger', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', '.The', 'cast', 'solid', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'phenomenal', 'carrying', 'entire', 'weight', 'film', 'shoulders', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'hilarious', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'perhaps', 'one', 'guy', 'whom', 'Elektra', 'can', 'love', 'Olyphant', 'Gugino', 'scenes', 'are', 'funniest', 'film', 'too', 'bad', 'only', 'blink', 'eye', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'also', 'solid', 'grossly', 'underused', 'Kathleen', 'Quinnan', 'being', 'standout', 'funny/creepy/thoughtful', 'cameo', 'uncredited', 'great', 'actress', 'spoilers', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'surprising', 'thing', 'film', 'be', 'sexy', 'being', 'exploitative', 'true', 'wonder', 'days', 'other', 'hand', 'script', 'bit', 'haphazard', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'meander', 'too', 'far', 'Elektra', 'story', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'character', 'inconsequential', 'actor', 'hilarious', 'skits', 'what', 'amount', 'add', 'nothing', 'story', 'whole', 'overall', 'effect', 'film', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'absolutely', 'funny', 'spots', 'again', 'kudos', 'Olyphant', 'Gugino', 'chance', 'prove', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'whole', 'ELEKTRA', 'LUXX', 'more', 'collection', 'parts', 'never', 'truly', 'congeal']",Elektra Luxx

Her day takes a weird twist.Overall, I really enjoyed this flick.  Couple of spots where the flow died.  It got resuscitated each time.  Supporting cast was delight.  How their paths cross.  Who's doing what & why.  If it hadn't died those 2 spots, it would have been 5 stars.I hate giving the synopsis of the movie when you can find it everywhere.  I dont like to give plot points away or how each actor/actress plays their roles.All I can say is I hope you found this as enjoyable as I did.Content, for a movie about a porn star, there is only 2 bare asses shown.

""EL"" can't seem to settle on a tone.  It tries to be a zany comedy (it's more amusing than funny), a drama, a satire (of porn movies?), a sexy romance,...it juggles all these in a somewhat unengaging, clumsy manner.  There are (too) many characters and many silly situations (events that would only happen in porn movies or cheesy sitcoms) that I guess are supposed to be seen as ""quirky.""  Much of the dialogue is stilted and lame, as in, real-people-don't-talk-this-way lame.  Carla Cugino's character does a ""Cabaret""-like song-and-dance bit that comes out of nowhere and while it's kinda cute-sexy, Carla G doesn't really sing well and it adds nothing to the movie overall.  It's worth seeing if you're a Gugino fan, but this is a mediocre movie, basically Pedro Almodovar Lite (and while I like some of his films, I think he's a tad overrated).

After being approached by a stranger with a tie to her dead ex-boyfriend her day starts to get weird.  If you have seen the previews to this then you think you know what the movie is about. You would be wrong.  From what I saw I expected a very funny comedy.  While this movie does have it's funny moments, at its core it actually a very moving story.  A woman who is trying to figure out where her life is is the one everyone seems to go to for advice, help or anything she can provide.  Being that the movie is about a porn star there are a few pretty raunchy scenes and dialogue, but no where near what you would have expected.  There is a shot a a male and female butt and that is the extent of the nudity.  The acting and characters are very entertaining that it makes you want to watch and see everyone get what they want.  This is not at all what I expected, it was better.  Overall a very touching, and somewhat funny story about finding out and being comfortable with who you are.  I give it a B+.Would I watch it again? - I think I actually would.*Also try - Finding Bliss",4,A very moving and somewhat funny movie about a porn star trying to change her life.
