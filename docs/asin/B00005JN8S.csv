On the one hand Universal has done a pretty good job of making some of the older and classic television shows available to their fans.  MSW is definitely a show that fans have been waiting for.  I'm one of the more casual fans.  As a teenager, when the show first aired, I enjoyed watching the first few seasons, after that I found that the shows were still good but the novelty had worn off.  However, when I heard that the first season was making its way to DVD I knew I would have to purchase a copy.  I don't remember having ever seen the pilot movie, ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes"", and that was an unexpected treat.  These early episodes are my favorites.  I enjoyed the Cabot Cove crowd that made up these episodes.  Claude Akins, Capt. Ethan Cragg,  as Jessica's friend that will do anything to help her.  Tom Bosley, Sheriff Amos Tupper, was my favorite Cabot Cove Sheriff,  I greatly missed him when he departed the show.  Also, each show was packed with multiple, and recognizeable, guest stars.  My favorite episode from season one is ""Murder takes the Bus.""  A nifty ""who-dunnit"" that keeps the viewer guessing as to who the killer(s) is.  This brings me to my compalint on the other hand of this issue.During my viewing of ""Murder takes the Bus"" my DVD froze and then skipped an entire chapter.  This is the fourth Universal DVD that I will have to take back for this problem.  I have no real knowledge of what causes a disk to freeze or skip but I'm willing to bet that it has to do with the way Universal crams eight shows on each disk, four on each side.  I'm sure that Universal is attempting to save money by limiting the amount of disks for each shows DVD release.  Well they can't be saving money, the shear amount of money they must be loosing in returns and exchanges is probably eliminating any savings they think they are making by using 3 disks instead of 6 for a seasons release of shows.  I've noticed that Anchor Bay, who released HUNTER and THREE'S COMAPANY only use one side of their disks and I have never had to return any of their DVD's.  Using one side of a disk makes them a lot easier to handle and I'm guessing that having less material crammed on the disk helps reduce the skipping and freezing.I would have given this DVD set a 4 star rating.  I deducted a star for the cheap Univeral DVD packaging and lack of extra features.  I would still suggest that fans buy this set but make sure you watch all the episodes as soon as you can so that you can return or exchange the set if you encounter viewing problems.",3,"Good show, bad DVD's!",1112832000,"04 7, 2005",2005,2600,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'one', 'hand', 'Universal', 'done', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'older', 'classic', 'television', 'available', 'fans', 'MSW', 'definitely', 'show', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', ""'m"", 'one', 'more', 'casual', 'fans', 'teenager', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'aired', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'found', 'shows', 'were', 'still', 'good', 'novelty', 'had', 'worn', 'off', 'However', 'when', 'heard', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'making', 'way', 'DVD', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'purchase', 'copy', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'having', 'ever', 'seen', 'pilot', 'movie', 'Murder', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'was', 'unexpected', 'treat', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'favorites', 'enjoyed', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'crowd', 'made', 'up', 'episodes', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'Capt', 'Ethan', 'Cragg', 'Jessica', 'friend', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'help', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Sheriff', 'Amos', 'Tupper', 'was', 'favorite', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'Sheriff', 'greatly', 'missed', 'when', 'departed', 'show', 'Also', 'show', 'was', 'packed', 'multiple', 'recognizeable', 'guest', 'stars', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'Murder', 'Bus', 'nifty', 'who-dunnit', 'viewer', 'guessing', 'who', 'killer', 's', 'compalint', 'other', 'hand', 'issue.During', 'viewing', 'Murder', 'Bus', 'DVD', 'froze', 'then', 'skipped', 'entire', 'chapter', 'fourth', 'Universal', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'take', 'back', 'problem', 'have', 'real', 'knowledge', 'what', 'disk', 'freeze', 'skip', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'do', 'way', 'Universal', 'eight', 'shows', 'disk', 'four', 'side', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Universal', 'attempting', 'save', 'money', 'limiting', 'amount', 'disks', 'shows', 'DVD', 'release', 'Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'saving', 'money', 'shear', 'amount', 'money', 'must', 'be', 'loosing', 'returns', 'exchanges', 'probably', 'eliminating', 'savings', 'think', 'are', 'making', 'using', '3', 'disks', 'instead', '6', 'seasons', 'release', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'who', 'released', 'HUNTER', 'THREE', 'COMAPANY', 'only', 'use', 'one', 'side', 'disks', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'return', 'DVD', 'Using', 'one', 'side', 'disk', 'lot', 'easier', 'handle', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'having', 'less', 'material', 'crammed', 'disk', 'reduce', 'skipping', 'freezing.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'DVD', 'set', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'deducted', 'star', 'cheap', 'Univeral', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'lack', 'extra', 'features', 'would', 'still', 'suggest', 'fans', 'buy', 'set', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'episodes', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'so', 'can', 'return', 'exchange', 'set', 'encounter', 'viewing', 'problems']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete First Season"
627795,ABGAL4ZQ7ZG0Z,B00005JN8S,Adelaidian,"[3, 7]","I was in my teens when MSW first appeared on television and could not get interested in it even though I've always been a fan of shows like Columbo, Remington Steele and Simon and Simon. Maybe I had a problem with there being a murder everywhere Jessica Fletcher went. I remember the title for Mad magazine's satire at the time was Murder She Hopes.Anyway, I recently bought season one of the show to see if it would grow on me. After watching the pilot movie and a few of the regular episodes, I found that the Jessica character is still annoying (at least Detective Columbo is sticking his nose into people's business because he's doing his job) and that the stories and supporting actors don't do enough to keep me interested. The Cabot Cove (I'm assuming a ficitious name) location shots are pretty though. This show is probably for fans only.For Australian fans, take note that the Region 4 release contains episodes that are little more than 46 minutes each. You may prefer purchasing the Region 1 set from Amazon, as I believe the episodes are around 48 minutes each. Beware though, as I have noticed that a few MSW reviewers have had problems with their double-sided Universal discs. Also see my Adam 12 Season One review regarding double-sided discs and edited episodes.Note added December 2008 - I've since found that some region 4 releases are shorter not because they have scenes deleted but because they play at a slightly faster speed (something to do with transfer to PAL format) - although you probably won't notice it in the voices or actions.",3,Probably one for the fans only,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,1560,"['was', 'teens', 'when', 'MSW', 'first', 'appeared', 'television', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'interested', 'even', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'shows', 'Columbo', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'Maybe', 'had', 'problem', 'being', 'murder', 'everywhere', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'went', 'remember', 'title', 'Mad', 'magazine', 'satire', 'time', 'was', 'Murder', 'Hopes.Anyway', 'recently', 'bought', 'season', 'one', 'show', 'see', 'would', 'grow', 'watching', 'pilot', 'movie', 'few', 'regular', 'episodes', 'found', 'Jessica', 'character', 'still', 'annoying', 'least', 'Detective', 'Columbo', 'sticking', 'nose', 'people', 'business', 'doing', 'job', 'stories', 'supporting', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'Cabot', 'Cove', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'ficitious', 'name', 'location', 'shots', 'are', 'pretty', 'show', 'probably', 'fans', 'only.For', 'Australian', 'fans', 'take', 'note', 'Region', '4', 'release', 'contains', 'are', 'little', 'more', '46', 'minutes', 'may', 'prefer', 'purchasing', 'Region', '1', 'set', 'Amazon', 'believe', 'episodes', 'are', '48', 'minutes', 'Beware', 'though', 'have', 'noticed', 'few', 'MSW', 'reviewers', 'have', 'had', 'problems', 'double-sided', 'Universal', 'discs', 'Also', 'see', 'Adam', '12', 'Season', 'One', 'review', 'regarding', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'edited', 'episodes.Note', 'added', 'December', '2008', ""'ve"", 'found', 'region', '4', 'releases', 'are', 'shorter', 'not', 'have', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'play', 'slightly', 'faster', 'speed', 'something', 'do', 'transfer', 'PAL', 'format', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'voices', 'actions']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete First Season"

But just so you're not disappointed, be forewarned that the quality of these discs is poor. (And I bought mine new from Amazon, so I know it's not a bootleg.) There are jumps and skips in the visual, sometimes the the soundtrack is out of synch, and the sound quality varies from ok to poor, especially on the ""flip"" side. It sounds like one of my speaker wires is loose, but they're fine because everything else I play on my DVD sounds great. I compare this to Quantum Leap (also double-sided) and it's hard to believe they're both produced by Universal.I find it ironic that the studios wage war against bootleggers, yet they take forever to release old shows, then force us to pay full price for poor quality releases like this. Seems like a better way to build our loyalty  would be to 1) release shows in a timely manner and 2) make sure that the authentic studio releases are of higher quality than a pirated one.

627810,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00005JN8S,C. O. DeRiemer,"[10, 10]","Murder, She Wrote might be a set of comfortable cozies designed for the BarcaLounger crowd, but count me in. It also is a classy murder mystery series which, over 12 seasons with usually 22 one-hour shows per season, maintained a high level of consistency and viewer loyalty.I think there are three reasons for this. First, the mysteries are solid. The writers mostly play fair with the audience. There are clues to be had if we're alert (although sometimes the clue may be so insignificant that expecting it to be noticed is optimistic). The mysteries often involve relationships among people with whom we're given the time to get to know. There seldom are out-and-out rotters. It's not always possible to spot the villain early, and when justice is done, thanks to Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury), the conclusion is satisfying.Second, Murder, She Wrote was shrewd in using the ""So that's what happened to him (or her)"" ploy in most of the programs. It can be immensely satisfying to a target audience of a certain age to come across once well known actors you haven't seen in quite a while. Lansbury and her producers almost always had strong character parts written for former marque names who still commanded affection and fans. In the Season 1 set, for instance, you'll encounter, among others, Howard Duff, Virginia Mayo, Martin Landau, Dan O'Herlihy, June Allyson, Van Johnson, Dane Clark, Jose Ferrer, Milton Berle, Stewart Granger, Eddie Bracken and Samantha Egger. These aren't stunt roles. The actors carry their weight. Angela Lansbury has always been a supremely confident and successful actor. She seems to thrive in having strong actors to play off of.Third, and most importantly, is Angela Lansbury. Over the years her appeal and her successes in movies, on Broadway and on television have been extraordinary. She seems able to play anything with complete aplomb. Did a dance hall girl ever have a more suspicious mind or do a more generous act than Em in The Harvey Girls? Did a housemaid ever seem more sluttish than Nancy in Gaslight? Did a grandmother ever seem...odder...than Grannie in The Company of Wolves? Did a mother ever seem more like an ice-cold demon from hell than Mrs. Iselin in The Manchurian Candidate? Years ago I saw her on Broadway in Sweeney Todd as the deranged Mrs. Lovett. Whenever she was on stage she simply dominated the audience. The role of Jessica Fletcher, mystery writer and resident of Cabot Cove, is one she could have played with her eyes shut. It's to her credit as an actor that she didn't. She turned Fletcher into an immensely likable character, smart, experienced, shrewd and, above all else, sympathetic. The fact that we like Jessica Fletcher is due to Lansbury and is the reason the series lasted for 12 seasons.The Season 1 set consists of three DVD's with the 21 programs on both sides of the discs. There are no extras. The quality of the video and audio transfers is just fine. The first four seasons are out on DVD with the other seasons to follow.",4,"A fine mystery series, thanks to solid plots, the pleasure of recognition and, above all else, Angela Lansbury",1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,3017,"['Murder', 'Wrote', 'might', 'be', 'set', 'comfortable', 'cozies', 'designed', 'BarcaLounger', 'crowd', 'count', 'also', 'classy', 'murder', 'mystery', 'series', '12', 'seasons', 'usually', '22', 'one-hour', 'shows', 'season', 'maintained', 'high', 'level', 'consistency', 'viewer', 'loyalty.I', 'think', 'are', 'three', 'reasons', 'First', 'mysteries', 'are', 'solid', 'writers', 'mostly', 'play', 'fair', 'audience', 'are', 'clues', 'be', 'had', ""'re"", 'alert', 'sometimes', 'clue', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'insignificant', 'expecting', 'be', 'noticed', 'optimistic', 'mysteries', 'often', 'involve', 'relationships', 'people', 'whom', ""'re"", 'given', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'seldom', 'are', 'out-and-out', 'rotters', 'not', 'always', 'possible', 'spot', 'villain', 'early', 'when', 'justice', 'done', 'thanks', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'conclusion', 'satisfying.Second', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'was', 'shrewd', 'using', 'So', 'what', 'happened', 'ploy', 'most', 'programs', 'can', 'be', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'target', 'audience', 'certain', 'age', 'come', 'once', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'Lansbury', 'producers', 'almost', 'always', 'had', 'strong', 'character', 'parts', 'written', 'former', 'marque', 'names', 'who', 'still', 'commanded', 'affection', 'fans', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'instance', ""'ll"", 'encounter', 'others', 'Howard', 'Duff', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Dan', ""O'Herlihy"", 'June', 'Allyson', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Dane', 'Clark', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Stewart', 'Granger', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'Samantha', 'Egger', 'are', ""n't"", 'stunt', 'roles', 'actors', 'carry', 'weight', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'always', 'been', 'supremely', 'confident', 'successful', 'actor', 'thrive', 'having', 'strong', 'actors', 'play', 'off', 'of.Third', 'most', 'importantly', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'years', 'appeal', 'successes', 'movies', 'Broadway', 'television', 'have', 'been', 'extraordinary', 'able', 'play', 'anything', 'complete', 'aplomb', 'Did', 'dance', 'hall', 'girl', 'ever', 'have', 'more', 'suspicious', 'mind', 'do', 'more', 'generous', 'act', 'Em', 'Harvey', 'Girls', 'Did', 'housemaid', 'ever', 'seem', 'more', 'sluttish', 'Nancy', 'Gaslight', 'Did', 'grandmother', 'ever', 'seem', 'odder', 'Grannie', 'Company', 'Wolves', 'Did', 'mother', 'ever', 'seem', 'more', 'ice-cold', 'demon', 'hell', 'Mrs.', 'Iselin', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'Years', 'saw', 'Broadway', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'deranged', 'Mrs.', 'Lovett', 'Whenever', 'was', 'stage', 'simply', 'dominated', 'audience', 'role', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'mystery', 'writer', 'resident', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'eyes', 'shut', 'credit', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'turned', 'Fletcher', 'immensely', 'likable', 'character', 'smart', 'experienced', 'shrewd', 'else', 'sympathetic', 'fact', 'like', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'due', 'Lansbury', 'reason', 'series', 'lasted', '12', 'seasons.The', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'consists', 'three', 'DVD', '21', 'programs', 'sides', 'discs', 'are', 'extras', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'transfers', 'just', 'fine', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'are', 'out', 'DVD', 'other', 'seasons', 'follow']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete First Season"

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[1, 1]","It is hard to believe that Angela Lansbury was not the first choice to play Jessica Fletcher in ""Murder, She Wrote."" CBS offered the role to Jean Stapleton, who declined. With all due respect to the talented Stapleton, only Angela Lansbury (""Gaslight,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""Bedknobs And Broomsticks"" and Broadway's ""Mame"", ""Gypsy"", ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Blithe Spirit"") could have made Jessica such a vital and interesting character. With Lansbury as star, ""MSW""  became  an enormously popular success; running 12 years (1984-1996) and earning Lansbury 12 Emmy nominations. Amazingly, and inexcusably, she never won.The series begins with a well-crafted 93 minute movie titled ""The Murder Of Sherlock Holmes."" Jessica's adorable nephew Grady (Michael Horton) sends her murder-mystery manuscript to a publisher. It is published, becomes an instant best-seller, and Jessica becomes a overnight celebrity (Surprise!). A guest is murdered at a costume party, and catching the killer comes at great personal cost to Jessica.Jessica is an American variation on mystery novelist Agatha Christie and Christie's crime-solving heroine Miss Marple. She lives in the quiet, fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine. But the series soon sends her off on a series of whirlwind adventures;  in such places as Hollywood, Broadway, Washington D.C. and a Mediterrian Island. And everywhere that Jessica goes, a murder occurs. ""MSW"" employs a gallery of guest stars every episode, who appear as murder suspects and murder victims. Many of the weekly guest stars had previously worked with Lansbury.Jessica is intelligent, observant, no-nonsense, fearless, and caring and compassionate when she needs to be-- with a strong sense of justice, of course. Her character is best described in the episode ""Tough Guys Don't Die."" When a judge marvels at her persistence and determination, Jessica modestly replies, ""It is not in my nature to leave things undone."" Although ""Murder"" is in the title, the series is, basically, a light-hearted  and fun  affair;  with a great deal of humor thrown in with the suspense. In the episode ""Hooray For Homicide"", Jessica searches for an important clue that went unnoticed by others. A police detective says, ""Tell me, Mrs. Fletcher, do you have any theories on Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance?"" She replies, ""There's no need to be sarcastic."" In the episode ""Tough Guys Don't Die,"" disgruntled detective Harry McGraw (""Law And Order's"" Jerry Orbach) is not at all happy to have Jessica working with him on a murder case. Harry flippantly suggests that Jessica return to Cabot Cove and her needlepoint. She says, ""I tried that and it put me to sleep. That's why I wrote my first book."" Harry growls back, ""I read your first book and it put me to sleep,"" Jessica instantly replies, ""Well, that's your privlege,"" as she storms out, refusing to be insulted any further.There are many memorable episodes. In  ""Lovers And Other Killers"", Jessica travels to Seattle to be a guest lecturer at a university. Her much younger male secretary David (Andrew Stevens) is accused of the murder of a wealthy older woman. The plot goes in some rather interesting directions, and we are never actually sure that David, while not a killer, is not a con-man and a seducer. And is he really attracted to Jessica? Never fear; Jessica doesn't fall for obvious tricks. The episode ""We're Off To Kill The Wizard"" features a wonderful performance by guest star  James Coco as the tyrannical owner of  a house of horrors.  In ""My Johnny Lies Over The Ocean"",  Jessica pretends to be falling-down drunk in order to catch a killer.The fan-favorite episode ""Murder Takes The Bus"" features all the elements of a tight, classic whodunit. Jessica takes a bus ride to Portland, Maine with her friend, the easily  flustered Sheriff Amos Tupper (""Happy Days'"" Tom Bosley). A thunderstorm erupts, a passenger is murdered. Suspects on this deadly bus trip include Linda Blair (""The Exorcist""), Larry Linville (""M*A*S*H"") , Rue McClanahan (""The Golden Girls"") and Michael Constantine (""Room 222""). Most of all, though, it is the charismatic Angela Lansbury who makes  ""Murder, She Wrote"" so entertaining.",4,"ANGELA LANSBURY MAKES ""MURDER"" MOST ENTERTAINING",1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,4176,"['hard', 'believe', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'choice', 'play', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'CBS', 'offered', 'role', 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'who', 'declined', 'due', 'respect', 'talented', 'Stapleton', 'only', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Gaslight', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'Bedknobs', 'Broomsticks', 'Broadway', 'Mame', 'Gypsy', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Blithe', 'Spirit', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Jessica', 'such', 'vital', 'interesting', 'character', 'Lansbury', 'star', 'MSW', 'became', 'enormously', 'popular', 'success', 'running', '12', 'years', '1984-1996', 'earning', 'Lansbury', '12', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'Amazingly', 'inexcusably', 'never', 'won.The', 'series', 'well-crafted', '93', 'minute', 'movie', 'titled', 'Murder', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Jessica', 'adorable', 'nephew', 'Grady', 'Michael', 'Horton', 'murder-mystery', 'manuscript', 'publisher', 'published', 'instant', 'best-seller', 'Jessica', 'overnight', 'celebrity', 'Surprise', 'guest', 'murdered', 'costume', 'party', 'catching', 'killer', 'great', 'personal', 'cost', 'Jessica.Jessica', 'American', 'variation', 'mystery', 'novelist', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Christie', 'crime-solving', 'heroine', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'quiet', 'fictional', 'town', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'Maine', 'series', 'soon', 'off', 'series', 'whirlwind', 'adventures', 'such', 'places', 'Hollywood', 'Broadway', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Mediterrian', 'Island', 'everywhere', 'Jessica', 'murder', 'MSW', 'gallery', 'guest', 'stars', 'episode', 'who', 'appear', 'murder', 'suspects', 'murder', 'victims', 'Many', 'weekly', 'guest', 'stars', 'had', 'previously', 'worked', 'Lansbury.Jessica', 'intelligent', 'observant', 'no-nonsense', 'fearless', 'caring', 'compassionate', 'when', 'be', 'strong', 'sense', 'justice', 'course', 'character', 'best', 'described', 'episode', 'Tough', 'Guys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Die', 'When', 'judge', 'marvels', 'persistence', 'determination', 'Jessica', 'modestly', 'not', 'nature', 'leave', 'things', 'undone', 'Murder', 'title', 'series', 'basically', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'affair', 'great', 'deal', 'humor', 'thrown', 'suspense', 'episode', 'Hooray', 'Homicide', 'Jessica', 'important', 'clue', 'went', 'unnoticed', 'others', 'police', 'detective', 'Tell', 'Mrs.', 'Fletcher', 'do', 'have', 'theories', 'Jimmy', 'Hoffa', 'disappearance', 'need', 'be', 'sarcastic', 'episode', 'Tough', 'Guys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Die', 'disgruntled', 'detective', 'Harry', 'McGraw', 'Law', 'Order', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'not', 'happy', 'have', 'Jessica', 'working', 'murder', 'case', 'Harry', 'flippantly', 'Jessica', 'return', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'needlepoint', 'tried', 'put', 'sleep', 'why', 'wrote', 'first', 'book', 'Harry', 'back', 'read', 'first', 'book', 'put', 'sleep', 'Jessica', 'instantly', 'Well', 'privlege', 'out', 'refusing', 'be', 'insulted', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'Lovers', 'Other', 'Killers', 'Jessica', 'Seattle', 'be', 'guest', 'lecturer', 'university', 'much', 'younger', 'male', 'secretary', 'David', 'Andrew', 'Stevens', 'accused', 'murder', 'wealthy', 'older', 'woman', 'plot', 'rather', 'interesting', 'directions', 'are', 'never', 'actually', 'sure', 'David', 'not', 'killer', 'not', 'con-man', 'seducer', 'really', 'attracted', 'Jessica', 'Never', 'fear', 'Jessica', ""n't"", 'fall', 'obvious', 'tricks', 'episode', ""'re"", 'Kill', 'Wizard', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'guest', 'star', 'James', 'Coco', 'tyrannical', 'owner', 'house', 'horrors', 'Johnny', 'Lies', 'Ocean', 'Jessica', 'be', 'falling-down', 'drunk', 'order', 'catch', 'killer.The', 'fan-favorite', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Takes', 'Bus', 'elements', 'tight', 'classic', 'whodunit', 'Jessica', 'bus', 'ride', 'Portland', 'Maine', 'friend', 'easily', 'flustered', 'Sheriff', 'Amos', 'Tupper', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'thunderstorm', 'erupts', 'passenger', 'murdered', 'deadly', 'bus', 'trip', 'include', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'Exorcist', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'M*A*S*H', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Michael', 'Constantine', 'Room', '222', 'Most', 'charismatic', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'who', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'so', 'entertaining']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete First Season"

627815,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,B00005JN8S,E. Hornaday,"[121, 124]","Saying that the upcoming DVD release of Murder, She Wrote is long overdue is like saying chocolate is only an ""OK"" treat -- a world class understatement! In fact, ""world class"" describes this venerable series perfectly, from its multi-talented cast, interesting stories and production value. Murder, She Wrote is arguably the most beloved American TV mystery series, and for good reason.The series began in 1984 when Angela Lansbury was 58 and continued through 1996 producing 264 episodes for CBS, and easily winning its time slot for most of its run.The fabulous Ms. Lansbury, who as a distinguished career on Broadway and in the movies, portrayed the lead character of Jessica Fletcher, a widowed, childless English teacher from the fictional small seaport of Cabot Cove, Maine. (The exteriors of the homes, seaport and ocean scenes were actually shot on the opposite coast -- in Mendicino, Calif.)In the series, Jessica's quiet and predictable life is abruptly turned upside down after her nephew submits a mystery manuscript she wrote under the name ""J.B. Fletcher"" to an East Coast publisher without her knowledge and the book is published. (In the show, Jessica's middle name is Beatrice.) The book becomes an instant bestseller, and Jessica-the-author continues to write similarly popular yarns until she becomes internationally famous. Equally famous is Jessica's uncanny knack at solving crimes as an amateur sleuth who is called upon to help by law enforcement from Cabot Cove to Europe and beyond as the series continues. (It is interesting to note that Jean Stapleton, who portrayed Edith Bunker on All in the Family, was first offered the role of Jessica but, thankfully, declined.)Show creators Richard Levinson, William Link and Peter S. Fischer (Lansbury's real-life husband) brought an impressively combined resume that included Columbo, Mannix, Alfred Hitchcock Present and Ellery Queen.In the show's premiere (included in this DVD release), Jessica's nephew Grady (portrayed throughout the series by Michael Horton) submits that fateful manuscript to a New York City publisher. Not only does that launch his beloved aunt's career, it quickly embroils her deeply into her first homicide investigation as well as a tragic love affair.Each week, viewers were treated to the often murderous happenings in small town, quiet Cabot Cove, which ended up having at least 50 murders investigated by Jessica over the course of the series. Jessica helped the local constabulary there, initially bumbling Sheriff Amos Tupper, portrayed by Tom Bosley, then a more credible Sheriff, Mort Metzger, portrayed by Ron Masak, to solve whatever crime occurred.Viewers also followed ""J.B."" around the world as she promoted her books on tour. Viewers were also treated to a fabulous character progression by Ms. Lansbury that took Jessica from a somewhat dowdy widow to a chic, sophisticated and internationally famous author of means and influence who helped citizens and governments alike. (She also helped a seemingly endless stream of nieces, nephews and other family members get out of trouble.)Along the way, Ms. Lansbury was supported by brilliant charactor actor William Windom who portrayed crusty Dr. Seth Hazlitt and Jessica's closest friend. Hazlitt felt more than friendship for Jessica as the show continued, but unfortunately, the two were never officially brought together.Broadway legends Len Cariou and the late Jerry Orbach (both friends of Ms. Lansbury) had recurring roles as British Intelligence Agent Michael Hagerty and Chicago Private Detective Harry McGraw, respectively. It was this role that provided Orbach with the opportunity to move on and join the cast of the celebrated Law & Order.When the show began, Jessica was inexperienced and naive, the opening title sequence featuring an old manual typewriter upon which she pounded out her novels. When the series went off the air, Jessica maintained a second apartment in New York, had dined with kings and queens, been involved in international intrigue, dressed in the most stylish fashions -- and the opening sequence featured an up-to-date computer and printer! But, at the heart of the series was the heart Ms. Lansbury endowed her alter ego of Jessica, who never forgot her humble beginnings or her friends and remained a woman of integrity, compassion and warmth.On the series, Ms. Lansbury was often able to showcase her many talents. Twice she played the dual role of her cousin Emma MacGill, a London dance hall performer. It is no coincidence that the singing and dancing Ms. Lansbury's given name is Angela Brigid MacGill Lansbury.We can only hope that the remaining seasons of this fine series are released in full and very, very soon!",5,"Murder, She FINALLY Wrote!!",1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,4723,"['Saying', 'upcoming', 'DVD', 'release', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'long', 'overdue', 'saying', 'chocolate', 'only',

Fletcher is loath to become a published author and ends with her sticking her nose into everyone's business as somewhat of an expert at solving crimes.  Even knowing ""whodunit"" doesn't keep this series from being entertaining, something to watch repeatedly.  It is chockfull of aging movie stars on their way out and young actors supposedly on their way up (although most of them never quite made it into the big time).I too had some difficulty playing these double sided disks.  For some reason my Blu-ray player couldn't handle them but my backup cheapo DVD player could.  (It's an inconvenience though, switching machines in the middle of an episode, finding where you were with the help of the scene search-&-find feature in the menu.)I was surprised to learn they initially thought to cast Jean Stapleton then Doris Day in the role made famous by Angela Lansbury (I still think it's criminal that they couldn't have coughed up one measly Emmy for the great work she did on this series!).

Since my husband and I got netflix, I decided to avail myself of the old TV shows I haven't seen in ages and that are now available on DVD.This series was one of them.I was delighted on how well written the who-dunnits are, and how great JB Fletcher's character is. I like how they portray her as an older lady that just wouldn't resort to knitting after her husband died. She instead followed her passion, and though she was probably about 60 when she did it, she still made a career for herself out of her hobby.Angela Lansbury does a great job at showing how Jessica Fletcher is on the ball and always looking to help those wrongly accused.I think that the heroine is an inspiration to women. Many people think that once you get older 'it's all downhill'. I'm relatively young ( 23) but I grew up with older parents ( my dad passed away at 67 and my mom is now 65) and I have seen how both men and women take age as something that is dreaded. My husband is 26 and now is freaking out about being almost thirty! I mean, come on!But we all do it.

It was a popular program intended for the family hour and ran for many years. I always mildly enjoyed it. We ordered Season 1 and Season 2. We're almost through with viewing Season 1.""Murder, She Wrote"" is an enjoyable series. Angela Lansbury and the supporting cast do a fine job. The stories are lightweight, but fun to follow. We usually have figured out who the culprit is before the end of the program, but that's all right. Although the stories mostly involve murders, there is generally a minimum of violence, and we prefer it that way. A great deal of care has been takes in constructing these programs and it shows. The settings are marvelous and I love viewing old New England with the quaint housing and antique furniture. One of the stories took place at the University of Washington in Seattle, a university where I just happened to attend graduate school. They did a marvelous job with it.We've enjoyed this series very much. It's not deep and thought-provoking. It's enjoyable and pleasant viewing and suites our needs well.

627831,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B00005JN8S,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[6, 7]","I remember when ""Murder, She Wrote"" first aired on CBS every Sunday night in the mid-80s. I never watched the show back then. It was probably because I was never into murder mysteries. But as the years passed by I started to watch murder mystery movies such as ""Murder on the Orient Express"", ""Death on the Nile"", and ""Jagged Edge"" and got immediately hooked. Then last year when I heard that the first season of ""Murder, She Wrote"" was coming out on DVD, I just couldn't resist. I had to buy it and watch the episodes. And boy am I sure glad I did!""Murder, She Wrote"" is one of the most intriguing and entertaining dramatic shows that I've ever seen. It's occasionally fast-paced, funny, and very well made. Angela Lansbury probably had the role of her career as murder mystery novelist/sleuth Jessica Fletcher. Each episode revolved around her trying to slove the murder of a certain character that gets bumped off. It's fun to watch as these episodes play out, trying to guess who done it. And usually by the end of every episode when Ms. Fletcher reveals who's the guilty party, (at least to me) it turns out to be a major surprise. That's what makes this show all the more intriguing.Another element that makes ""Murder, She Wrote"" a fun show to watch is to see the guest stars that turn up in each episode. Season one had plenty of familiar faces who showed up for a guest appearence. They included: Leslie Nielsen (""The Naked Gun""), Rue McClanahan (""The Golden Girls""), Jerry Orbach (""Law & Order""), Vicki Lawrence (""The Carol Burnett Show""), Peter Graves (""Airplane!""), Martin Landau (""Ed Wood""), Lynn Redgrave (""Georgy Girl""), Linda Blair (""The Exorcist""), Piper Laurie (""Carrie""), as well as comedy legend Milton Berle, football great Dick Butkus, and a very young Joaquin Phoenix (""Walk the Line""), who's billed under his former name Leaf Phoenix for the episode that he appears in.Just about every episode in season one of ""Murder, She Wrote"" is good. My favorite episodes from season one include: ""It's a Dog's Life"", We're Off to Kill the Wizard"", ""Death Casts a Spell"", ""My Johnny Lies Over the Ocean"", ""Sudden Death"", ""Murder Takes the Bus"", and ""Armed Response"". Also good is the pilot movie ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes"" that got ""Murder, She Wrote"" off and running for what would eventually be 12 long years.But the biggest mystery about ""Murder, She Wrote"" is why didn't Angela Lansbury win an Emmy for her work as Jessica Fletcher? What in god's name were those Emmy voters thinking of back then? They nominated Lansbury for all 12 seasons of the show and didn't reward her with one Emmy. Not one. That's a crime that I don't think anyone could slove. On the bright side, Lansbury did win a couple of Golden Globe awards for the show, including a Golden Globe for season one.""Murder, She Wrote"" is a great show and I'm glad that I'm getting a chance to catch up on these episodes.",5,"Murder, She Wrote: Season One",1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2902,"['remember', 'when', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'first', 'aired', 'CBS', 'Sunday', 'night', 'mid-80s', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'probably', 'was', 'never', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'years', 'passed', 'started', 'watch', 'murder', 'mystery', 'movies', 'such', 'Murder', 'Orient', 'Express', 'Death', 'Nile', 'Jagged', 'Edge', 'got', 'immediately', 'hooked', 'Then', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'heard', 'first', 'season', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'had', 'buy', 'watch', 'episodes', 'boy', 'am', 'sure', 'glad', 'did', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'entertaining', 'dramatic', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'occasionally', 'fast-paced', 'funny', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'probably', 'had', 'role', 'career', 'murder', 'mystery', 'novelist/sleuth', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'episode', 'revolved', 'trying', 'slove', 'murder', 'certain', 'character', 'bumped', 'off', 'fun', 'watch', 'episodes', 'play', 'out', 'trying', 'guess', 'who', 'done', 'usually', 'end', 'episode', 'when', 'Ms.', 'Fletcher', 'reveals', 'who', 'guilty', 'party', 'least', 'out', 'be', 'major', 'surprise', 'what', 'show', 'more', 'intriguing.Another', 'element', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'fun', 'show', 'watch', 'see', 'guest', 'stars', 'turn', 'up', 'episode', 'Season', 'one', 'had', 'plenty', 'familiar', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'guest', 'appearence', 'included', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'Rue', 'McClanahan', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Law', 'Order', 'Vicki', 'Lawrence', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Show', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Airplane', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'Exorcist', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Carrie', 'as', 'well', 'comedy', 'legend', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'football', 'great', 'Dick', 'Butkus', 'very', 'young', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Walk', 'Line', 'who', 'billed', 'former', 'name', 'Leaf', 'Phoenix', 'episode', 'in.Just', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'good', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'include', 'Dog', 'Life', ""'re"", 'Kill', 'Wizard', 'Death', 'Spell', 'Johnny', 'Lies', 'Ocean', 'Sudden', 'Death', 'Murder', 'Bus', 'Armed', 'Response', 'Also', 'good', 'pilot', 'movie', 'Murder', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'got', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'running', 'what', 'would', 'eventually', 'be', '12', 'long', 'years.But', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'win', 'Emmy', 'work', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'What', 'god', 'name', 'were', 'Emmy', 'voters', 'thinking', 'back', 'then', 'nominated', 'Lansbury', '12', 'seasons', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'reward', 'one', 'Emmy', 'Not', 'one', 'crime', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'slove', 'bright', 'side', 'Lansbury', 'did', 'win', 'couple', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'awards', 'show', 'including', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'season', 'one', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'great', 'show', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'m"", 'getting', 'chance', 'catch', 'up', 'episodes']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete First Season"

Don't you just love Jessica, our own Miss Marple. In the shows she is a retired school teacher who is now into writing murder mysteries, but who is solving a real life murder in every show. The cops may be stalled (or stupid), but Jessica is always on the ball. She's no namby pamby little old lady either. That tongue of hers can be quite sharp too and no one can best her when it comes to a battle of wits. Another reason to watch the shows is seeing all the actors and actresses you have forgotten over the years. I'm watching one now with Chuck Conners in it (from season 2) and I'd forgotten all about him. Every show is like that. You are constantly wandering who is that person?

627844,A9BC9ZVINYMHQ,B00005JN8S,"Meredith Burton ""Bookworm""","[1, 1]","""Murder, She Wrote"" has always been one of my favorite televission mystery series. I truly love Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Jessica Fletcher, a widowed mystery novelist living in Cabit Cove, Maine. Jessica not only writes mysteries, she naturally solves them as well. Through her down-home common sense, she cleverly outwits clever killers who feel that they are undefeatable. Jessica Fletcher is a character of immense magnitude, and one who will always be remembered.This DVD set is good despite some faulty sound quality in places. It contains three disks with six episodes on each. My favorite episode is the pilot, ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes,"" which explains how Jessica became a writer, and finds her solving the murder of a man who she briefly met at a costume party. The man was, you guess it, dressed like Sherlock Holmes! Jessica uses ingenuity to reach a surprising conclussion, and along the way, becomes imbroilled in many hilarious escapades.Not only is Jessica unforgettable, but the quirky characters in her hometown are also memorable.This series is truly worth watching.

627846,ADBAJLF1ZJ0TB,B00005JN8S,Mikey,"[1, 1]","Back in May 1985, UK broadcaster ITV commenced a series which would go on to run for 12 series, Murder She Wrote. The structure was extremely straightforward. Each week, novelist Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) would become involved in a murder, either at home in Cabot Cove, Maine or on one of her many destinations that she would end up in. Basically if Jessica Fletcher is in town, you can be sure of a murder.To this day the series has had countless reuns on both the BBC and ITV. During the 1980s and 1990s ITV had first run episodes and then repeated them all. In the 2000s BBC1 and BBC2 took turns in running them. Even to this day (December 2011), ITV are rerunning episodes in the afternoons. Not to mention the numerous satellite channels that have also screened it. This series could be played forever!Just a tiny selection of the countless guest stars in this first boxset include - Ned Beatty (Homicide: Life on the Street), Tom Bosley (Happy Days), Dack Rambo (Dallas), Jared Martin (Dallas), Kerry Armstrong (Prisoner: Cell Block H), Jerry Orbach (Law and Order), Barbara Babcock (Dallas/Hill Street Blues/Dr Quinn Medicine Woman), John Beck (Dallas), Morgan Brittany (Dallas), Diane Muldaur (LA Law), Rue McClanahan (Golden Girls) and William Windom in a different role to the recurring role he would have from series 2 as Dr Seth Hazlett.""Murder Takes The Bus"" is probably my favourite episode in this set.

627868,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JN8S,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 8]","The real mystery at the heart of ""Murder She Wrote"" is how school teacher turned mystery writer Jessica Fletcher managed to be around when so many people were murdered. Personally, I think it's a conspiracy that Fletcher cooked up to sell books and that she framed everyone she exposes. That's my theory and I'm sticking to it. ""Murder She Wrote"" stuck around for an astonishing 264 episodes. Like ""Columbo"" (also created by co-producers/writers Richard Levinson and William Link), there's a solid formula at work on the series that hooks mystery fans as laid out in the 2 hour pilot episode (the cleverly titled ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes"" also included).Universal has done a solid job in this transfer. While there are some age related artifacts, colors are pretty good but there's plenty of dust and debris. This could easily have been cleaned up. It's also clear that there was no restoration done on this show. Considering the age of the series, I'm not surprised that this doesn't look as pristine as, say, ""24"". The good news is that these don't appear to be the syndicated versions that have been in play for some time (at least as far as I can tell from the running times). Since this was shot and aired prior to the advent of widespread stereo these early episodes are in mono but sound surprisingly spry. The dialogue is crisp and clear and it's not as muffled as the sound on other shows from the same time frame.Extras? Where did they disappear to? This is a mystery that it would take Jessica Fletcher to crack. Where are the extras? Universal has been rushing out their TV productions at a breakneck pace as if to make up for their initial reluctance to put them out when DVD first became the standard. It appears that most of the marketing budget went into the nice package design and quality of the transfers (as well as advertising the set) as there's absolutely nothing in the way of extras. There's certainly enough trivia about the series to make a worthwhile featurette or two; Jean Stapleton (""All in the Family"") was first offered the role of Jessica and turned it down. How Angela Lansbury ended up on the radar for the role would be a very nice featurette. ""The Grand Old Lady"" episode of ""Murder She Wrote"" was written by Link and Levinson for their old TV show ""Ellery Queen"" nearly a decade before and was rewritten for the series. The marvelous William Windom who eventually became a semi-regular as Dr. Hazlett was originally cast as Sam Breen in the 21st episode of the first season. What's the story behind Windom becoming a regular? Windom (like Lansbury) is/was still around when this was prepared so why not a featurette on that (perhaps that'll be in a later set). Likewise,  haracter actor Ron Masak appeared during the first season but later became a semi-regular in 1988 but as a completely different character. Perhaps doing a featurette in the form of a mystery (not unlike one that Jessica might solve herself) about the creation of the series, casting and popularity might be an option for future sets. I doubt, though, that will happen.Here's a novel idea that Universal might try for later seasons; ask some well regarded mystery writers who enjoyed the series to do a commentary track or two and how their characters might solve the mystery compared to Jessica Fletcher.It's truly a mystery as to why this took such a long and torturous route to DVD, but fans will be happy that the show finally is at hand. While the image quality could be significantly better, it's not as bad as some TV shows that have been released to TV recently (""Twilight Zone: The 80's"" for example).  Now you can sit down and jog your memory to see if you remember the clues, the killers and the red herrings in the first season of ""Murder She Wrote"". Miss Marple would be proud of Jessica. Then again, there's a movie tie in here; let's see Miss Marple and Jessica battle and match wits to figure out why all those dead bodies drop around their respective heroines.",5,I love a mystery,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,3993,"['real', 'mystery', 'heart', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'how', 'school', 'teacher', 'turned', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'managed', 'be', 'around', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'murdered', 'Personally', 'think', 'conspiracy', 'Fletcher', 'cooked', 'up', 'sell', 'books', 'framed', 'everyone', 'theory', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'stuck', 'astonishing', '264', 'episodes', 'Columbo', 'also', 'created', 'co-producers/writers', 'Richard', 'Levinson', 'William', 'Link', 'solid', 'formula', 'work', 'series', 'mystery', 'fans', 'laid', 'out', '2', 'hour', 'pilot', 'episode', 'cleverly', 'titled', 'Murder', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'also', 'included', '.Universal', 'done', 'solid', 'job', 'transfer', 'are', 'age', 'related', 'artifacts', 'colors', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'plenty', 'dust', 'debris', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'also', 'clear', 'was', 'restoration', 'done', 'show', 'Considering', 'age', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'pristine', 'say', '24', 'good', 'news', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'play', 'time', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'running', 'times', 'was', 'shot', 'aired', 'prior', 'advent', 'widespread', 'stereo', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'mono', 'sound', 'surprisingly', 'spry', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'clear', 'not', 'as', 'muffled', 'sound', 'other', 'shows', 'same', 'time', 'frame.Extras', 'Where', 'did', 'disappear', 'mystery', 'would', 'take', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'crack', 'Where', 'are', 'extras', 'Universal', 'been', 'rushing', 'out', 'TV', 'productions', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'make', 'up', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'put', 'out', 'when', 'DVD', 'first', 'became', 'standard', 'most', 'marketing', 'budget', 'went', 'nice', 'package', 'design', 'quality', 'transfers', 'as', 'well', 'advertising', 'set', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'way', 'extras', 'certainly', 'enough', 'trivia', 'series', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'featurette', 'two', 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'Family', 'was', 'first', 'offered', 'role', 'Jessica', 'turned', 'down', 'How', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'ended', 'up', 'radar', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'nice', 'featurette', 'Grand', 'Old', 'Lady', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'was', 'written', 'Link', 'Levinson', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'nearly', 'decade', 'was', 'rewritten', 'series', 'marvelous', 'William', 'Windom', 'who', 'eventually', 'became', 'semi-regular', 'Dr.', 'Hazlett', 'was', 'originally', 'cast', 'Sam', 'Breen', '21st', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'What', 'story', 'Windom', 'becoming', 'regular', 'Windom', 'Lansbury', 'is/was', 'still', 'around', 'when', 'was', 'prepared', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'featurette', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'be', 'later', 'set', 'Likewise', 'haracter', 'actor', 'Ron', 'Masak', 'appeared', 'first', 'season', 'later', 'became', 'semi-regular', '1988', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'Perhaps', 'doing', 'featurette', 'form', 'mystery', 'not', 'one', 'Jessica', 'might', 'solve', 'creation', 'series', 'casting', 'popularity', 'might', 'be', 'option', 'future', 'sets', 'doubt', 'though', 'will', 'happen.Here', 'novel', 'idea', 'Universal', 'might', 'try', 'later', 'seasons', 'ask', 'well', 'regarded', 'mystery', 'writers', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'do', 'commentary', 'track', 'two', 'how', 'characters', 'might', 'solve', 'mystery', 'compared', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher.It', 'truly', 'mystery', 'why', 'took', 'long', 'torturous', 'route', 'DVD', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'show', 'finally', 'hand', 'image', 'quality', 'could', 'be', 'significantly', 'better', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'TV', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'TV', 'recently', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '80', 'example', 'Now', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'jog', 'memory', 'see', 'remember', 'clues', 'killers', 'red', 'herrings', 'first', 'season', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'Jessica', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', 'tie', 'here', 'let', 'see', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Jessica', 'battle', 'match', 'wits', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'dead', 'bodies', 'drop', 'respective', 'heroines']","Murder, She Wrote: The Complete First Season"

Lansbury plays former high school English teacher Jessica Fletcher who takes up writing as a hobby after retirement. Her debut mystery novel ""The Corpse Danced at Midnight"" makes the bestseller list and in the pilot episode ""The Murder of Sherlock Holmes"" Jessica travels to NYC where she is greeted by her nephew Grady and his girlfriend who happens to work for Jessica's publisher. This pilot episode is pivotal in setting the stage to portray Jessica as a consummate sleuth and there's even a possible romance angle!The charm of Murder, She Wrote lies in Angela Lansbury's amazing and very credible portrayal as a talented author and an astute sleuth. Lansbury is supported by an amazing ensemble cast, and many of the guest stars in each episode are TV stars themselves. This makes this show a wonderful walk down memory lane as the viewer is encouraged to identify each actor. The idyllic setting of the fictional Cabot Cove, Maine is the perfect backdrop, serving as J.B. Fletcher's home base, and the inhabitants are an interesting and eccentric bunch of characters. Though murders are committed with alarming frequency in this scenic setting, this is portrayed in a credible manner (reminds one of the contemporary British cozy crime drama, Midsomer Murders).Each episode is a treat, and the sleuthing Jessica is amazing to watch as she unravels one mystery after another. I first watched Murder She Wrote when I was a teenager, and still love the series after all these years which attests to the show's staying power.
