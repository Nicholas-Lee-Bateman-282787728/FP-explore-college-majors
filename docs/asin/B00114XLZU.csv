1129823,A9XKE4OE48BNK,B00114XLZU,Byron,"[5, 9]",I'm finding that the high star ratings on some of these posts don't match the content of the actual reviews.  This is one of the worst Whos of the '80s (which contained a lot of clunkers).I think Colin Baker could have been a great Doctor if he hadn't been stuck with a producer who was only interested in the PR aspects of  the show rather than actual quality. This resulted in some bad scripts and bad companions (the whining Peri with her phony American accent and the perkily annoying Mel) plus he was forced to wear the most ridiculously conceived costume ever (he had wanted something in black). He still managed to produce 4 or 5 good stories but this wasn't one of them. If you want better ones tryDoctor Who:  Vengeance on Varos (Episode 139)andDoctor Who - The Two Doctors (Episode 141)(an extremely dark comic hoot!).I know that the BBC wants to exploit all of their Doctor Who properties regardless of quality but can't we lay off the stinkers for awhile?

1129824,A11GO5VA74HD8K,B00114XLZU,Crazy Fox,"[3, 4]","Poor Sixth Doctor. He just gets no respect. Here in ""Timelash"" he neither picks up a gun to shoot down the enemy nor smothers the enemy to death, dashing off a morbid quip as he does so. Nobody eats human flesh, nobody drops into a vat of acid. Nothing's unduly controversial or disturbing. So does ""Timelash"" get any credit for walking the comfortably straight and narrow? Oh no, far from it. It comes in for harsher criticism yet.Which, just like the face of the story's principal villain, the Borad, is either perfectly fair or unfairly foul, depending on your perspective. The basic idea of the story is superb. The Borad, once an unsavory biologist on the planet Karfel who in the midst of one of his unethical experiments inadvertently became fused with his reptilian specimen, now he's the unseen but all-seeing dictator of the planet, banishing any dissidents through a time tunnel (the eponymous Timelash) while secretly engineering a war that will leave unscathed only himself and a new race like him in appearance. The Doctor and Peri step into this situation as it nears its crisis (of course), meanwhile involving Herbert, a bouncy young would-be science fiction writer from turn-of-the-century England--a clever pseudo-historical touch all the more enjoyable in that the real Herbert's later novel ""The Time Machine"" was one of the inspirations for ""Doctor Who"" back in the early 60's (Who made who?). Basically, this is all good classic Who through and through. And since both the prior two stories and the following one include as a theme shadily motivated genetic manipulation gone wrong, it's hard not to suspect that something was in the news or whatnot in 1985 making an unsettling impression on the social imagination. The manner in which the story plays with the unspoken power politics of seeing and being seen in its depiction of a claustrophobically totalitarian society is also ingenious. Judging only from all this, ""Timelash"" should be hailed as a classic. Has it been unfairly castigated?Well, not exactly. The concept is sound enough, but its realization is radically uneven in quality. The actual plotting of the story and the script itself bear telltale traces that the writer, Glen McCoy, was himself (somewhat like Herbert) full of enthusiasm but just a bit unpracticed yet. The ending after an ending after an ending is anti-climatic, the Doctor's sacrificing himself and the Tardis to save Karfel only to show up moments later coyly deferring explanation is an unbearable cop-out, and the confusing references to a prior visit by the Doctor in his third incarnation unnecessary and cheesy. The acting ranges from excellent to horrid. Colin Baker carries the show as the flamboyantly brusque, temperamental, delightfully arrogant Doctor with hearts of gold, and Robert Ashby's portrayal of the Borad is flawless, coldly calm in his cruelty. Paul Darrow's villainous take on the Borad's majordomo Tekker is also great fun. Most of the rest of the cast though give the most uninspired and absolutely wooden performance imaginable, and this flatline context has the adverse effect of making David Chandler's Herbert seem a bit over-the-top in comparison. Strangely, the special effects show this same wild variability, from the Borad's amazingly convincing make-up to the painfully obvious Christmas tinsel of the Timelash.So, in the final analysis, is ""Timelash"" the cream of the cream or the lees and the dregs? One might as well ask if the glass is half empty or half full. But if you're a Doctor Who fan it would be a shame not to take a sip and see for yourself.",4,"""To be perfectly frank, Herbert.""",1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,3599,"['Poor', 'Sixth', 'Doctor', 'just', 'respect', 'Here', 'Timelash', 'up', 'gun', 'shoot', 'down', 'enemy', 'enemy', 'death', 'dashing', 'off', 'morbid', 'quip', 'so', 'Nobody', 'human', 'flesh', 'nobody', 'vat', 'acid', 'Nothing', 'unduly', 'controversial', 'disturbing', 'So', 'Timelash', 'get', 'credit', 'walking', 'comfortably', 'straight', 'narrow', 'Oh', 'far', 'harsher', 'criticism', 'yet.Which', 'just', 'face', 'story', 'principal', 'villain', 'Borad', 'either', 'perfectly', 'fair', 'unfairly', 'foul', 'depending', 'perspective', 'basic', 'idea', 'story', 'superb', 'Borad', 'once', 'unsavory', 'biologist', 'planet', 'Karfel', 'who', 'midst', 'one', 'unethical', 'experiments', 'inadvertently', 'became', 'fused', 'reptilian', 'specimen', 'now', 'unseen', 'all-seeing', 'dictator', 'planet', 'banishing', 'dissidents', 'time', 'tunnel', 'eponymous', 'Timelash', 'secretly', 'engineering', 'war', 'will', 'leave', 'unscathed', 'only', 'new', 'race', 'appearance', 'Doctor', 'Peri', 'step', 'situation', 'crisis', 'course', 'meanwhile', 'involving', 'Herbert', 'bouncy', 'young', 'would-be', 'science', 'fiction', 'writer', 'turn-of-the-century', 'England', 'clever', 'pseudo-historical', 'touch', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'real', 'Herbert', 'later', 'novel', 'Time', 'Machine', 'was', 'one', 'inspirations', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'back', 'early', '60', 'Who', 'made', 'who', 'Basically', 'good', 'classic', 'Who', 'prior', 'two', 'stories', 'following', 'one', 'include', 'theme', 'shadily', 'motivated', 'genetic', 'manipulation', 'gone', 'wrong', 'hard', 'not', 'suspect', 'something', 'was', 'news', 'whatnot', '1985', 'making', 'unsettling', 'impression', 'social', 'imagination', 'manner', 'story', 'unspoken', 'power', 'politics', 'seeing', 'being', 'seen', 'depiction', 'claustrophobically', 'totalitarian', 'society', 'also', 'ingenious', 'Judging', 'only', 'Timelash', 'should', 'be', 'hailed', 'classic', 'been', 'unfairly', 'castigated', 'Well', 'not', 'exactly', 'concept', 'sound', 'enough', 'realization', 'radically', 'uneven', 'quality', 'actual', 'plotting', 'story', 'script', 'bear', 'telltale', 'traces', 'writer', 'Glen', 'McCoy', 'was', 'somewhat', 'Herbert', 'full', 'enthusiasm', 'just', 'bit', 'unpracticed', 'yet', 'ending', 'ending', 'ending', 'anti-climatic', 'Doctor', 'sacrificing', 'Tardis', 'save', 'Karfel', 'only', 'show', 'up', 'moments', 'later', 'coyly', 'deferring', 'explanation', 'unbearable', 'cop-out', 'confusing', 'references', 'prior', 'visit', 'Doctor', 'third', 'incarnation', 'unnecessary', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'ranges', 'excellent', 'horrid', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'show', 'flamboyantly', 'brusque', 'temperamental', 'delightfully', 'arrogant', 'Doctor', 'hearts', 'gold', 'Robert', 'Ashby', 'portrayal', 'Borad', 'flawless', 'coldly', 'cruelty', 'Paul', 'Darrow', 'villainous', 'take', 'Borad', 'majordomo', 'Tekker', 'also', 'great', 'fun', 'Most', 'rest', 'cast', 'give', 'most', 'uninspired', 'absolutely', 'wooden', 'performance', 'imaginable', 'flatline', 'context', 'adverse', 'effect', 'making', 'David', 'Chandler', 'Herbert', 'seem', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'comparison', 'Strangely', 'special', 'effects', 'show', 'same', 'wild', 'variability', 'Borad', 'amazingly', 'convincing', 'make-up', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Christmas', 'tinsel', 'Timelash.So', 'final', 'analysis', 'Timelash', 'cream', 'cream', 'lees', 'dregs', 'One', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'ask', 'glass', 'half', 'empty', 'half', 'full', ""'re"", 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'not', 'take', 'sip', 'see']",N/A

People either love it or hate it with very little in between.The basic idea is that in a dictatorship of the future, political opponents are thrown into the ""Time Lash"" a time machine that sends them into exile in medival earth. It comes to the Doctor's attention as the tardis inturupts one such rebel and diverts her to 19th century Scotland. there she, the Doctor and his companion along with a vacationing school teacher named Herbert set off to see who's meddling in time, only to discover this is a world the doctor, as Jon Pertwee visited years before. The Doctor needs little spuring on to oppose any dictator but to find a planet where he's known has fallen on hard times makes it double so.This is Colin Baker at his best, a bar whose height is fiercely debated. He and the writing staff have grown comfortable enough to know what they are about. Baker is confident to the ppint of arrogant smugness, but pulls it off. Sure the f/x are cheesey, this is Doctor Who and that is part of the charm.The two down sides: Paul Darrow as the pawn of the dictator is so over the top in his performance it's camp out of all scale. and Secondly the ending has a sort of double play, like they weren't sure how to end it, wrote two endings and then used them both. it is, clumsy, and also contradicts the known Dr Who sequence of events.But it still remains one of my favorites from a bad couple of seasons, partly for the doctor's style, partly from Herbert.

Everyone, it seems, has a different explanation as to why ""Timelash"" failed: the fault might lie with the guest actors, or with the director, or the writer, the producer, the set designer...  Everyone, just this once, is correct.""Timelash""'s script is a mess, and that's the fatal flaw.  There's too much going on and the end result is less than the sum of its parts.  There's an interplanetary war, a deformed dictator (part man, part plesiosaur), some no-nonsense rebels (played here by a pretty young woman and a bald fat guy), a bunch of squabbling Senators, a time corridor in space... and a young H.G. Wells.  The characters are by and large one-dimensional, and the dialogue is mostly woeful.  Nothing that happens on the planet Karfel ever really engages the viewer... except for Paul Darrow.Best known for his role on ""Blake's 7"", Darrow came to this story expected to turn in a similar performance.  Instead, he wanted to explore fresh waters by playing his character as Richard the Third.  He delivers, in the end, a sarcastic, pompous, oily performance that would have worked really well... had any of the other guest actors been up to the challenge.  Instead, he sticks out like a sore thumb.  As Darrow says in the DVD's making-of featurette, the story really does get boring once his character exits, midway through the final episode.The making-of documentary, by the way, is one of the DVD production team's liveliest efforts thus far.  Several members of the production (cast and crew) spread the blame around.  Script editor Eric Saward, as he always does, blames the producer, a man who's been dead for years.  He does point some of the blame at the episode director, but then blames the producer for hiring said director in the first place.  As a result, these 20 minutes are far livelier than anything that happens during ""Timelash"" proper.""Timelash""'s strength is in the voice acting.  Three men alone were up to the task of adding gravitas to their lines: Colin Baker (the Doctor), Darrow, and Robert Ashby (the plesiosaur), who reportedly wrote his own ripostes when the script failed him: ""Another expedition into the realms of duplicity"".  Separated from its drab sets and heard only as an audio play, ""Timelash"" might offer some moments of true menace.Unfortunately, apart from those three performances, the rest of the guest cast are just going through the motions, likely as confused by the story as were the script editor and director.  ""Timelash"" winds up a dull misfire, not as bad its legend has grown, but certainly not worth the DVD cover price unless you're a completist.",3,"""Turn off when I'm dead, it's boring""",1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,2704,"['Timelash', 'long', 'been', 'maligned', 'worst', 'story', 'one', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'weaker', 'seasons', 'Everyone', 'different', 'explanation', 'why', 'Timelash', 'failed', 'fault', 'might', 'lie', 'guest', 'actors', 'director', 'writer', 'producer', 'set', 'designer', 'Everyone', 'just', 'once', 'correct', 'Timelash', 'script', 'mess', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'end', 'result', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'interplanetary', 'war', 'deformed', 'dictator', 'part', 'man', 'part', 'plesiosaur', 'no-nonsense', 'rebels', 'played', 'here', 'pretty', 'young', 'woman', 'bald', 'fat', 'guy', 'bunch', 'squabbling', 'Senators', 'time', 'corridor', 'space', 'young', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'characters', 'are', 'large', 'one-dimensional', 'dialogue', 'mostly', 'woeful', 'Nothing', 'planet', 'Karfel', 'ever', 'really', 'viewer', 'Paul', 'Darrow.Best', 'known', 'role', 'Blake', '7', 'Darrow', 'came', 'story', 'expected', 'turn', 'similar', 'performance', 'Instead', 'wanted', 'explore', 'fresh', 'waters', 'playing', 'character', 'Richard', 'Third', 'end', 'sarcastic', 'pompous', 'oily', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'had', 'other', 'guest', 'actors', 'been', 'up', 'challenge', 'Instead', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'Darrow', 'DVD', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'story', 'really', 'get', 'boring', 'once', 'character', 'exits', 'midway', 'final', 'episode.The', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'way', 'one', 'DVD', 'production', 'team', 'liveliest', 'efforts', 'thus', 'far', 'Several', 'members', 'production', 'cast', 'crew', 'spread', 'blame', 'around', 'Script', 'editor', 'Eric', 'Saward', 'always', 'producer', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'dead', 'years', 'point', 'blame', 'episode', 'director', 'then', 'producer', 'hiring', 'said', 'director', 'first', 'place', 'result', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'far', 'livelier', 'anything', 'Timelash', 'proper', 'Timelash', 'strength', 'voice', 'acting', 'Three', 'men', 'alone', 'were', 'up', 'task', 'adding', 'gravitas', 'lines', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'Doctor', 'Darrow', 'Robert', 'Ashby', 'plesiosaur', 'who', 'reportedly', 'wrote', 'own', 'ripostes', 'when', 'script', 'failed', 'expedition', 'realms', 'duplicity', 'Separated', 'drab', 'sets', 'heard', 'only', 'audio', 'play', 'Timelash', 'might', 'offer', 'moments', 'true', 'menace.Unfortunately', 'apart', 'three', 'performances', 'rest', 'guest', 'cast', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'likely', 'confused', 'story', 'were', 'script', 'editor', 'director', 'Timelash', 'up', 'dull', 'misfire', 'not', 'bad', 'legend', 'grown', 'certainly', 'not', 'DVD', 'cover', 'price', ""'re"", 'completist']",N/A

It's certainly my favorite Colin Baker story along with ""Vengeance on Varos"" and ""The Trial of a Time Lord: Parts 1-4"".Ultimately the worst thing about this story is Peri's role in it. All she does in it is scream, get threatened by monsters and madmen, get yelled at by the Doctor, and told to stay out of the way of things. I rather felt bad for actress Nycola Bryant when I watched this. Now I woundn't blame her if this was her least favorite story. But I'm surprised that a lot of other people hate it too. The only other bad thing about this story is the alien ambassador in it. He looks like a sock puppet. He looks absolutely dreadful.But other than those things, I can't see any other bad things about this story. The plot is actually quite good and engaging. There's never a dull moment. And apart from the alien ambassador, who only appears in a few scenes, I thought the special effects were pretty good too. They certainly weren't the best - but it's ""Doctor Who""! For ""Dr. Who"" standards they really weren't that bad, and some of the sets were very imaginative and impressive... especially the Timelash. The story echoes a lot of the earlier stories in the series. This story has a lot of the themes in it that earlier stories had. A lot of those themes are what made ""Dr. Who"" so great and enjoyable, and is what made a lot of the earlier stories so popular. It also echoes some of H.G. Wells' writings. I feel that this story deserves a lot more credit than that which is given to it. And I thought the scenes between the Doctor and Herbert were very enjoyable. I also like the idea of H.G.

Even those involved with the story don't regard it highly.In trying to pinpoint why exactly I enjoy Timelash so much, I came up with simply that it is the Colin Baker story most reminiscent of the pre-JNT, post- Phillip Hinchliffe Tom Baker era, the Graham Williams stories of the late 70s.  One could easily imagine this story being part of season 17, coincidentally another much maligned era of Doctor Who.  Try to imagine the sets in Timelash without the actors, and you could easily imagine that you are watching Invisible Enemy, The Sun Makers, Invasion of Time, or Nightmare of Eden.  I realize that only one of the aforementioned stories is actually from season 17, but all of them are from the Graham Williams era, which is my point.Another aspect that fits in with this theory is the tone of Timelash.  In a season teeming with excessively dark, adult-in-nature stories, Timelash represents a departure from this, back to a time when Doctor Who was made for children.  It is strategically sandwiched between two stories of a gloomy nature with very adult themes, The Two Doctors and Revelation of The Daleks, with both containing strong undertones of cannibalism.  Here we have a light-hearted, old-school adventure as a bit of comic relief.  Comedy has always worked in Doctor Who. Without comedic moments, Doctor Who would become Star Trek. GASP.Something else Doctor Who does very well is using its mythology to explain earth history. Timelash proves no exception.  In fact it offers two explanations into real-life events. The obvious one is that the Doctor & his Tardis spurred H.G. Wells to greatness.  Also, an explanation is given of reasons for sightings of the Loch Ness monster.  Other reasons to recommend Timelash include Colin Baker's shameless portrayal of the Doctor, which I have always found quite enjoyable. So what if he yells a lot?  His banter with the curious and spunky Herbert, excellently portrayed by David Chandler, is priceless.  Admittedly, Peri is whiny, but she is one of the better-looking companions in Doctor Who history.  And anything with Paul Darrow is a can't-miss. He is well-casted as the secondary villain, Maylin Tekker.  As always, Darrow plays a character you just love to hate, fresh off his Avon role in Blake's 7. We naturally cheer when the villain ""buys it"", however, when Tekker gets killed you can't help but feel a bit of sorrow for him.  As evil as he was throughout the entire story, he had that brief moment of conscience before his death when he realized what the Borad was really up to, sticking up for his people.Timelash also contains a well-hidden moral message. If you are ugly, you can't just go around killing all the beautiful people and re-populating your world with other repulsive creatures such as yourself just to be able to show yourself in public. If you try, the Doctor will stop you!  In the end, Timelash is unfairly maligned by Whonatics everywhere. However, for me, it represents what classic Doctor Who is all about.  It's a story that although made in the 80s, takes me back to the best Doctor Who decade, the 70s.",5,"""You microcephalic apostate""",1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,3532,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'BBC', 'video', ""n't"", 'listen', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fandom', 'otherwise', 'story', 'such', 'Timelash', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'DVD', 'release', 'must', 'admit', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'era', 'favorite', 'C.', 'Baker', 'story', 'always', 'even', 'way', 'back', '80s', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'many', 'disregard', 'Timelash', 'mindless', 'junk', 'notion', 'reinforced', 'DVD', 'extra', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'making', 'Timelash', 'Even', 'involved', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'regard', 'highly.In', 'trying', 'pinpoint', 'why', 'exactly', 'enjoy', 'Timelash', 'so', 'much', 'came', 'up', 'simply', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'story', 'most', 'reminiscent', 'pre-JNT', 'post-', 'Phillip', 'Hinchliffe', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'era', 'Graham', 'Williams', 'stories', 'late', '70s', 'One', 'could', 'easily', 'imagine', 'story', 'being', 'part', 'season', '17', 'coincidentally', 'much', 'maligned', 'era', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Try', 'imagine', 'sets', 'Timelash', 'actors', 'could', 'easily', 'imagine', 'are', 'watching', 'Invisible', 'Enemy', 'Sun', 'Makers', 'Invasion', 'Time', 'Nightmare', 'Eden', 'realize', 'only', 'one', 'aforementioned', 'stories', 'actually', 'season', '17', 'are', 'Graham', 'Williams', 'era', 'point.Another', 'aspect', 'theory', 'tone', 'Timelash', 'season', 'teeming', 'excessively', 'dark', 'adult-in-nature', 'stories', 'Timelash', 'departure', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'made', 'children', 'strategically', 'sandwiched', 'two', 'stories', 'gloomy', 'nature', 'very', 'adult', 'themes', 'Two', 'Doctors', 'Revelation', 'Daleks', 'containing', 'strong', 'undertones', 'cannibalism', 'Here', 'have', 'light-hearted', 'old-school', 'adventure', 'bit', 'comic', 'relief', 'Comedy', 'always', 'worked', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'comedic', 'moments', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'would', 'become', 'Star', 'Trek', 'GASP.Something', 'else', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'very', 'well', 'using', 'mythology', 'explain', 'earth', 'history', 'Timelash', 'exception', 'fact', 'two', 'explanations', 'real-life', 'events', 'obvious', 'one', 'Doctor', 'Tardis', 'spurred', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'greatness', 'Also', 'explanation', 'given', 'reasons', 'sightings', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'monster', 'Other', 'reasons', 'recommend', 'Timelash', 'include', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'shameless', 'portrayal', 'Doctor', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'So', 'what', 'lot', 'banter', 'curious', 'spunky', 'Herbert', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'David', 'Chandler', 'priceless', 'Admittedly', 'Peri', 'whiny', 'one', 'better-looking', 'companions', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'history', 'anything', 'Paul', 'Darrow', ""can't-miss"", 'well-casted', 'secondary', 'villain', 'Maylin', 'Tekker', 'always', 'Darrow', 'character', 'just', 'love', 'hate', 'fresh', 'off', 'Avon', 'role', 'Blake', '7', 'naturally', 'cheer', 'when', 'villain', 'however', 'when', 'Tekker', 'killed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'bit', 'sorrow', 'As', 'evil', 'was', 'entire', 'story', 'had', 'brief', 'moment', 'conscience', 'death', 'when', 'realized', 'what', 'Borad', 'was', 'really', 'up', 'sticking', 'up', 'people.Timelash', 'also', 'well-hidden', 'moral', 'message', 'are', 'ugly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'around', 'killing', 'beautiful', 'people', 're-populating', 'world', 'other', 'repulsive', 'creatures', 'such', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'show', 'public', 'try', 'Doctor', 'will', 'stop', 'end', 'Timelash', 'unfairly', 'maligned', 'Whonatics', 'everywhere', 'However', 'what', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', 'made', '80s', 'back', 'best', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'decade', '70s']",N/A

The story is typical, and might even have been decent if a little more time and money had been thrown at it, but the result is disappointing, not to say laughable.Paul Darrow makes a memorable villain, carrying on from ""Blake's 7"" as a scenery-chomping theatrical baddie. The Borad, the main monster of the serial, is actually quite good in its few scenes, and continues the tradition of hideous deformed humans threatening the good guys. HG Wells makes an appearance, and some references to Wells' famous books are tossed in, to little effect.The scenery is worse than usual. The sets are cardboard, and the titular ""timelash"" vortex is quite ludicrous, involving a sort of door with a few steps up to it, and then some tinsel...it really is no better than it sounds. The Morlox, another monster than threatens Peri, looks like the head and neck of a giant snake, or something. It's not really clear what's going on with that bit. There's also a guard robot that's not too awful, but a big disappointment if you've seen the awesome robots in ""Robots of Death"" or ""Mysterious Planet"". The costumes also look like old bedsheets.Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant try their best, but the script is so padded out that even over-the-top performances can't make up for the awkward staging and cheap sets.

He must not only free the populace but also avert an interplanetary war in the process.The two leads are less irritating with each other than they were in the earlierThe Mark of the Ranibut the Doctor is still a bit rude and overbearing for my tastes (though he has a few good moments as well), and Peri is particularly useless in this adventure.  There are several things that don't work too well and there is a lot of padding in the second half (it was running under its allotted time.)  ""Timelash"" is an infamously poorly regarded story, but to be fair, most of its criticisms could be leveled at any given episode of the original series.  I can't exactly defend it, but I don't think it's significantly worse than a lot of others.  Watch it for Paul Darrow's performance, which is great fun.  (Darrow jokes (?) that you should turn it off after his character dies because it becomes boring.)The DVD contains a featurette called ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in which the main cast, writer and script editor talk about the making of the story and why it turned out the way it did.

The acting is inconsistent, ranging from the best with the two regulars, Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant, (in a desparate bid to carry the story) to the worst with the actress playing Vena, who looks like she's being forced at gunpoint to do this, reading nearly every line in a monotone,  the story ending is a cop-out (""I'll explain later"" the Doctor says, when Peri asks him how he survived the Bandril's missile), and yes, the some of the set looks unusually cheap (But why should the last thing be a massive issue?)Why do I like it so much then?The whole H.G. Wells storyline is a massive plus for the story in my view. Every time I watch Timelash, I found my interest hitting high-gear. Just putting the naive, spirit-mad, writer wannabe young H.G.Wells before he became famous with the most angry, aggressive-eccentric, moody Doctor, and BAM! Fireworks.Also deserving a mention is the Borad. Most reviews I've found for the VHS release I've seen just lump every part of this story in the ""Horrible"" category, but the Borad has to be one of the most well-realised monsters of the classic era, done so well on a small budget, like Colin says on the commentary, it's like a trick camera profile, with one side human, and one side Borad, and the two meld in to make it a VERY convincing monster.
