Many accolades have been heaped upon it, but it's availablity has been obscure for so long, which is a real shame.  I have to admit that I was suspicious from the previews that it would be one of those ""noble"" entries one finds that becomes drawn out and tedious.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find how accessible and enjoyable this film really is.Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi) is a typical immigrant protagonist.  Coming from Pakistan, he lives and works in New York City, the quintessential immigrant city:  One that's filled with opportunity as well as bewildering urban bustle and stress.  Like many with ingenuity, he has his own business.  He's a street vendor who sells hot beverages to commuters on a busy city street.  The portrait of him and his life unfolds along the way in ways that are engaging and colorful.Soon we find out that he has come to the one year anniversary of his wife's death, and he has been estranged to his son, Sajjad, whom his inlaws have custody.  He is a hard worker, like so many immigrants, and this initiative pays off with one customer who hires him to do some work on an apartment.  It is during this liason that we learn that Ahmad was famous previously, but I won't divulge the nature here.  However, this new business associate gets him some new business for which he was famous, and from here he meets a lovely Spanish immigrant (Leticia Dolera) who becomes his new love interest.He does what he can, but he seems to have to choose between love and money, welfare and family along the way.  He has a friend named Muhammad (Charles Daniel Sandoval) who checks up on him, and from their conversations we pick up on their lives.  Reflecting on making ends meet Ahmad says, ""[It] Gets harder for people like you and me...What I need to do, I'll do.""  What makes 'Man Push Cart' so worthwhile is the intimate view of his struggles and motivations--what makes him tick and the decisions he makes to have a better life.Complications develop and some of the movie borrows a bit from Italy's classic 'The Bicycle Thief,' but the story is so authentically presented that it feels like a documentary of real people than it does a movie rehash.  The direction by Ramin Bahrani is excellent for making us walk in the shoes of Ahmad and feel the struggle of his journey.",4,Love or Money,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,2354,"['Push', 'Cart', 'absorbing', 'slice-of-life', 'movie', 'Many', 'accolades', 'have', 'been', 'heaped', 'availablity', 'been', 'obscure', 'so', 'long', 'real', 'shame', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'suspicious', 'previews', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'noble', 'one', 'drawn', 'out', 'tedious', 'However', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'how', 'accessible', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'really', 'is.Ahmad', 'Ahmad', 'Razvi', 'typical', 'immigrant', 'protagonist', 'Coming', 'Pakistan', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'quintessential', 'immigrant', 'city', 'One', 'filled', 'opportunity', 'as', 'well', 'bewildering', 'urban', 'bustle', 'stress', 'many', 'ingenuity', 'own', 'business', 'street', 'vendor', 'who', 'hot', 'beverages', 'commuters', 'busy', 'city', 'street', 'portrait', 'life', 'unfolds', 'way', 'ways', 'are', 'engaging', 'colorful.Soon', 'find', 'out', 'come', 'one', 'year', 'anniversary', 'wife', 'death', 'been', 'estranged', 'son', 'Sajjad', 'whom', 'inlaws', 'have', 'custody', 'hard', 'worker', 'so', 'many', 'immigrants', 'initiative', 'pays', 'one', 'customer', 'who', 'do', 'work', 'apartment', 'liason', 'learn', 'Ahmad', 'was', 'famous', 'previously', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'nature', 'here', 'However', 'new', 'business', 'associate', 'new', 'business', 'was', 'famous', 'here', 'lovely', 'Spanish', 'immigrant', 'Leticia', 'Dolera', 'who', 'new', 'love', 'interest.He', 'what', 'can', 'have', 'choose', 'love', 'money', 'welfare', 'family', 'way', 'friend', 'named', 'Muhammad', 'Charles', 'Daniel', 'Sandoval', 'who', 'up', 'conversations', 'pick', 'up', 'lives', 'Reflecting', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'Ahmad', '[', ']', 'Gets', 'harder', 'people', 'What', 'need', 'do', ""'ll"", 'do', 'What', 'Push', 'Cart', 'so', 'worthwhile', 'intimate', 'view', 'struggles', 'motivations', 'what', 'tick', 'decisions', 'have', 'better', 'life.Complications', 'develop', 'movie', 'bit', 'Italy', 'classic', ""'The"", 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'story', 'so', 'authentically', 'presented', 'documentary', 'real', 'people', 'movie', 'rehash', 'direction', 'Ramin', 'Bahrani', 'excellent', 'making', 'walk', 'shoes', 'Ahmad', 'feel', 'struggle', 'journey']",N/A
1091851,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000TSJ01I,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[8, 19]","I can now say that I have officially watched the most boring and depressing film ever imaginable. And it's name is MAN PUSH CART. I say this with utter befuddlement, for this film was nominated in multiple film festival categories and even won a few, and it's been praised as ""the most striking American independent movie of the past year"" by the New York Times. Roger Ebert even said, ""I loved it!"" Well I'm going to not-so-humbly disagree with these upper echelon reviewers and show you why.First is the acting; it's nonexistent. The main actor, Ahmad Razvi, plays Ahmad, a Pakistani immigrant who survives in America by hocking coffee and muffins to the street-walking denizens of New York from his rented vending cart. Unable to afford a car in which to tow it, Ahmad pushes the hefty cart daily to its morning location on New York's busy streets. Why Ahmad does this is initially a mystery, but later the audience comes to understand that he does it as a sort of homage to his recently deceased wife and his equally dead life. Actor Razvi is deadpan in this role and his cyclical work-life is equally morbid. There seems to be no purpose in what he does nor where he'll go once he gets there.Equally bad is the script of the story. It's nowhere eventuality means little to most viewers since most film watchers are vested in stories that actually have a point. This one's only motive seemed to be how quickly it could depress the audience. The death of Ahmad's wife, Ahmad's life, his distant family, broken or fleeting friendships, and even a dead kitten all make this a very dark and unredeeming independent film.Usually with indie films of this type you get a few pearls of excitement; perhaps some interesting camera shots, or some unique perspectives on indepth characters. Not so here. Everything is dead or dying. From Ahmad's past to his future, there seems little point in him to continue breathing let alone working the streets of New York. In fact, I felt like I should stop breathing and end my tortuous watching of this film, but decided that I have more to offer life than Ahmad or the makers of this terrible flick.So I kept breathing ...just barely.",1,"Sorry, But This Film Was Depressing And Nearly Made Me Slit My Wrists",1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,2170,"['can', 'now', 'say', 'have', 'officially', 'watched', 'most', 'boring', 'depressing', 'film', 'ever', 'imaginable', 'name', 'MAN', 'PUSH', 'CART', 'say', 'utter', 'befuddlement', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'multiple', 'film', 'festival', 'categories', 'even', 'won', 'few', 'been', 'praised', 'most', 'striking', 'American', 'independent', 'movie', 'past', 'year', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'even', 'said', 'loved', 'Well', ""'m"", 'going', 'not-so-humbly', 'disagree', 'upper', 'echelon', 'reviewers', 'show', 'acting', 'nonexistent', 'main', 'actor', 'Ahmad', 'Razvi', 'Ahmad', 'Pakistani', 'immigrant', 'who', 'America', 'hocking', 'coffee', 'muffins', 'street-walking', 'denizens', 'New', 'York', 'rented', 'vending', 'cart', 'Unable', 'afford', 'car', 'tow', 'Ahmad', 'hefty', 'cart', 'daily', 'morning', 'location', 'New', 'York', 'busy', 'streets', 'Why', 'Ahmad', 'initially', 'mystery', 'later', 'audience', 'understand', 'sort', 'homage', 'recently', 'deceased', 'wife', 'equally', 'dead', 'life', 'Actor', 'Razvi', 'deadpan', 'role', 'cyclical', 'work-life', 'equally', 'morbid', 'be', 'purpose', 'what', 'where', ""'ll"", 'go', 'once', 'there.Equally', 'bad', 'script', 'story', 'nowhere', 'eventuality', 'little', 'most', 'viewers', 'most', 'film', 'watchers', 'are', 'vested', 'stories', 'actually', 'have', 'point', 'one', 'only', 'motive', 'seemed', 'be', 'how', 'quickly', 'could', 'depress', 'audience', 'death', 'Ahmad', 'wife', 'Ahmad', 'life', 'distant', 'family', 'fleeting', 'friendships', 'even', 'dead', 'kitten', 'make', 'very', 'dark', 'unredeeming', 'independent', 'film.Usually', 'indie', 'films', 'type', 'get', 'few', 'pearls', 'excitement', 'perhaps', 'interesting', 'camera', 'shots', 'unique', 'perspectives', 'indepth', 'characters', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'Everything', 'dead', 'dying', 'Ahmad', 'past', 'future', 'little', 'point', 'continue', 'breathing', 'let', 'alone', 'working', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'fact', 'felt', 'should', 'stop', 'breathing', 'end', 'tortuous', 'watching', 'film', 'decided', 'have', 'more', 'offer', 'life', 'Ahmad', 'makers', 'terrible', 'flick.So', 'kept', 'breathing', 'just', 'barely']",N/A

1091853,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B000TSJ01I,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[21, 22]","""Man Push Cart"" is a very sad movie, though not entirely bleak or depressing.  It is the story of Ahmad, a Pakistani man who has immigrated to America and struggles to get ahead while working as a push-cart street vendor.  Much of the movie is taken up with long, slow shots of his actual, physical struggle -- Ahmad is renting his cart and doesn't have enough money for a car, so he has to pull the cart across busy New York city streets in the pre-dawn hours, as traffic starts to pick up.  Midday, when his coffee and bagels have been sold, he hauls the cart back to the garage, wanders around midtown Manhattan for a while, then takes the subway back to a tiny apart in the outer borroughs, where he briefly sleeps, only to get up at 3:00am and start his daily routine all over again.The film defies may expectations and cliches... To begin with, Ahmad didn't come to America to ""get ahead"": as we slowly learn a part of his history, we discover that he was once a popular musician in Pakistan, and that he emigrated here to follow the woman he loved.  The story of their marriage and its end is Ahmad's great tragedy, but we are never given the whole story, only glimpses into the past, and the film also never explains Ahmad's reluctance to be a musician again.  He never likes talking about it, and when his new acquaintances discover that he was once a famous performer, he simply demurs and avoids discussing it.  Others sing in this film, but Ahmad does not.  His reluctance talk about himself is explained obliquely -- in one scene, we see him hanging out with some friends, listening impassively as one man trots another in front of a crowd of barflies and insists that he ""Tell your story!  Tell your story!""  For whatever reason, Ahmad doesn't want his life to be reduced to just another story that's told around the bar, as if cataloging his experience would reduce it to nothingness, or wrest control of his own story away from him.  He already put himself on display, back in Pakistan, and now, here in America, he chooses to just live his life, not share it with strangers.Although ""Man Push Cart"" is a powerful, subtle depictation of the modern immigrant experience, it is also an important commentary on the current climate of ""reality""-based media, where average people aspire to be seen on TV, and have their tiniest flaws projected across the landscape of popular culture.  Ahmad, who once had actual fame, let go of it for love, and now finding himself at the bottom heap of society, chooses to stay there, anonymous and self-contained.  He is not a happy man, but in a strange way, he seems contented.Apparently his character is being reprised in director Ramin Bahrani's next film, ""Chop Shop.""  Whether more of Ahmad's past will be revealed is uncertain; in some ways, I hope it remains unknown.  At any rate, this is a very good film, which you will find engrossing from start to finish.  The parts of the story that are unresolved or unknown are actually its greatest strengths, and one of the elements that make this film so distinctive.  Highly recommended!

It is clear from the director's commentary that many people contributed to this for free, or for small money.  So the connections were instrumental and it seems they included more than a few Pakistanis.  After running this up the flagpole there was a lot of saluting.Bahrani mentions Cassavetes' 'Chinese Bookie' and European films but does not exude a fondness for products of the Dream Factory.  He also mentions Sisyphus several times.

You find out that an immigrant from Pakistan runs a cart in a New York City street corner, that he was once a famous rock star in his hometown Lahore, that his wife is dead, and that his mother-in-law hates him. But you never find out ""why"". Why did he end up in the US doing something a rock star in Lahore would never be doing? Why doesn't he take up a better job when someone offered it to him? Why is his wife's death connected with his present experience?And because you never get these answers, it's hard to relate to the character. Heck, I'm a Pakistani immigrant to the US, and I couldn't even relate to him! It was also disappointing that he didn't even show any sign of musical talent, even though he was supposedly a rock star. I realize that this is an independent film, with a much smaller budget compared to those of Hollywood movies, but even an independent film should have enough substance that the audience can understand his motives. This film just didn't have that substance. The only time I felt empathy towards him was when something bad happened to him towards the end.The movie makes a point that some immigrants were wealthy, highly educated, or in this case, famous in their native country, and they may have to start over as a ""nobody"" once they step foot on American soil.

Alvi,"[6, 6]","I thought that ""Chop Shop"" was among the best movies I've ever seen, so watching ""Man Push Cart"" seemed to be a logical next step.The two movies are similar, but there's a key difference: while both movies vividly and poignantly depict the struggles of people in the bottom stratum of society (particularly in urban environments), ""Chop Shop"" manages to weave in some vitally uplifting elements, whereas ""Man Push Cart"" is unrelentingly bleak.I came away from the movie feeling rather sad about the hopeless and perhaps even dehumanizing life represented by the lead character, and I can't think of any lessons I could glean from the movie, other than remembering to have empathy for those less fortunate and to appreciate my own circumstances ... having just said that, maybe these lessons aren't so minor after all?  In any case, although this movie isn't a masterpiece like ""Chop Shop,"" I'm still giving ""Man Push Cart"" four stars because it at least masterfully depicts what it (presumably) intended to depict.As far as whether I can recommend the movie, that's hard to say.  If you're looking for a movie which is at all uplifting, perhaps look elsewhere.

1091858,A10LRVZJ2NUKTU,B000TSJ01I,Jesus Santos,"[0, 0]","Man Push Cart is a film that was released in 2007 and it deals with the struggle of coming to America in hopes of finding that American Dream that all foreigners see on television. The film highlights the exile of one's country for being limited to the career that a person has. For example the films stars Ahmad Razvi, Leticia Dolera, Charles Daniel Sandoval, and others and we see how the main character was a famous singer in his country, but he is only limited to music in his country. The music in his country only limited him to music in his language instead of music worldwide. Then when we comes to the United States in hopes of making his dreams come true the audience sees how constantly the door is slammed in his face. This causes the character, like any other human being to be discouraged and down, which has made him be very passive to all the consequences that happen to him.Man in a Push Cart really has to deal with the camera angles and the lighting to reflect on the character in order for the audience to understand that he is a victim. A lot of the camera angles were high so the audience is looking down on him, and when he was pushing the cart the camera angles were far away so the audience can see how hard it is to push a heavy cart everyday through the busy streets of New York. Pushing a cart or hard labor is something no one expects to do when coming to the land of opportunities, but this person we could see the struggles daily by the way the director does the repeatedly scenes of how he wakes up, gets ready, goes to push the cart, and sets up the cart.What is hard for the audience to witness is that another Pakistanian is living the business life and he is rich while we see this character and hope it is him someday. He is giving and romantic and the audience sees how he loses one thing after another. He loses the girl he wants, and eventually all of his friendship and family. Not being allowed to see his son is a motivation for him to work, but constantly the audience wonders how his wife died. It was mentioned that it was because of his fault, but the audience can openly assume that it may have something to do with his poor living condition, or that her family never wanted them to date.All in all, this movie through camera angles, lighting, and setting the director, Rahmin Bahrani is able to illustrate a great light on what it actually is to move to the United States for most people.",5,Man In a Push Cart Art and Exile,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,2437,"['Man', 'Push', 'Cart', 'film', 'was', 'released', '2007', 'struggle', 'coming', 'America', 'hopes', 'finding', 'American', 'Dream', 'foreigners', 'see', 'television', 'film', 'exile', 'one', 'country', 'being', 'limited', 'career', 'person', 'example', 'films', 'stars', 'Ahmad', 'Razvi', 'Leticia', 'Dolera', 'Charles', 'Daniel', 'Sandoval', 'others', 'see', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'famous', 'singer', 'country', 'only', 'limited', 'music', 'country', 'music', 'country', 'only', 'limited', 'music', 'language', 'instead', 'music', 'worldwide', 'Then', 'when', 'United', 'States', 'hopes', 'making', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'audience', 'how', 'constantly', 'door', 'slammed', 'face', 'character', 'other', 'human', 'being', 'be', 'discouraged', 'down', 'made', 'be', 'very', 'passive', 'consequences', 'happen', 'him.Man', 'Push', 'Cart', 'really', 'deal', 'camera', 'angles', 'lighting', 'reflect', 'character', 'order', 'audience', 'understand', 'victim', 'lot', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'high', 'so', 'audience', 'looking', 'down', 'when', 'was', 'pushing', 'cart', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'far', 'away', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'hard', 'push', 'heavy', 'cart', 'busy', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'Pushing', 'cart', 'hard', 'labor', 'something', 'one', 'do', 'when', 'coming', 'land', 'opportunities', 'person', 'could', 'see', 'struggles', 'daily', 'way', 'director', 'repeatedly', 'scenes', 'how', 'up', 'ready', 'push', 'cart', 'up', 'cart.What', 'hard', 'audience', 'witness', 'Pakistanian', 'living', 'business', 'life', 'rich', 'see', 'character', 'hope', 'someday', 'giving', 'romantic', 'audience', 'how', 'one', 'thing', 'girl', 'eventually', 'friendship', 'family', 'Not', 'being', 'allowed', 'see', 'son', 'motivation', 'work', 'constantly', 'audience', 'how', 'wife', 'died', 'was', 'mentioned', 'was', 'fault', 'audience', 'can', 'openly', 'assume', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'poor', 'living', 'condition', 'family', 'never', 'wanted', 'date.All', 'movie', 'camera', 'angles', 'lighting', 'setting', 'director', 'Rahmin', 'Bahrani', 'able', 'illustrate', 'great', 'light', 'what', 'actually', 'move', 'United', 'States', 'most', 'people']",N/A

1091861,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000TSJ01I,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Man Push Cart is a fascinating and brilliantly executed film that paints the portrait of a man in excruciating emotional pain from his inner demons and his not so happy interpersonal relationships. The plot flows along at a good pace and although many details are left out it never really seems to make a difference; at the end I truly felt that I knew the man working at that push cart every day and the conclusion, although somewhat abrupt, was stills satisfying since, after all, life isn't necessarily neatly tied up at the ends. The cinematography and the choreography are excellent; and the casting was thoughtfully done--the acting is very convincing, too. In addition, I liked the script.When the film starts, we meet the incredibly lonely and depressed Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi) who came with his wife from Pakistan a few years prior. (The plot leads us to believe that Ahmad came to America to follow the woman he loved.) During the film we only find out that she is now dead and that her parents, Ahmad's former in-laws, blame him for her death as if it were possibly some sort of accident. Ahmad's relationship with his very young son isn't that great; and the boy's maternal grandparents have very likely influenced the young boy to not want his father in his life.Ahmad, who was a rock star back in Pakistan, now ekes out a living by operating a push cart which he is slowly making installments on to buy from another immigrant. It all is very bleak; but one day Ahmad makes friends with the rather wealthy Mohammad (Charles Daniel Sandoval) who tries to help him get back into the music business although Ahmad is strangely ambivalent at best, even though the money would help him try to get his son back from his former in-laws. We also see Ahmad start a somewhat awkward romance with a young Spanish girl, Noemi (Leticia Dolera).In addition, look for excellent performances by all including Ali Reza as Manish and Arun Lal as Ahmad's father-in-law.The DVD has two short films by writer/director Ramin Bahrani; but these are the only extras we get. There are no extras directly related to Man Push Cart.I recommend Man Push Cart for fans of drama, independent drama and/or the immigrant experience in America; you won't forget this film anytime soon.",5,remarkable drama of one man's pain and struggle for survival,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,2260,"['Man', 'Push', 'Cart', 'fascinating', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'film', 'portrait', 'man', 'excruciating', 'emotional', 'pain', 'inner', 'demons', 'not', 'so', 'happy', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'many', 'details', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'never', 'really', 'make', 'difference', 'end', 'truly', 'felt', 'knew', 'man', 'working', 'push', 'cart', 'day', 'conclusion', 'somewhat', 'abrupt', 'was', 'stills', 'satisfying', 'life', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'neatly', 'tied', 'up', 'ends', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'are', 'excellent', 'casting', 'was', 'thoughtfully', 'done', 'acting', 'very', 'convincing', 'too', 'addition', 'liked', 'script.When', 'film', 'meet', 'incredibly', 'lonely', 'depressed', 'Ahmad', 'Ahmad', 'Razvi', 'who', 'came', 'wife', 'Pakistan', 'few', 'years', 'prior', 'plot', 'believe', 'Ahmad', 'came', 'America', 'follow', 'woman', 'loved', 'film', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'now', 'dead', 'parents', 'Ahmad', 'former', 'in-laws', 'blame', 'death', 'were', 'possibly', 'sort', 'accident', 'Ahmad', 'relationship', 'very', 'young', 'son', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'boy', 'maternal', 'grandparents', 'have', 'very', 'likely', 'influenced', 'young', 'boy', 'not', 'want', 'father', 'life.Ahmad', 'who', 'was', 'rock', 'star', 'back', 'Pakistan', 'now', 'out', 'living', 'operating', 'push', 'cart', 'slowly', 'making', 'installments', 'buy', 'immigrant', 'very', 'bleak', 'one', 'day', 'Ahmad', 'friends', 'rather', 'wealthy', 'Mohammad', 'Charles', 'Daniel', 'Sandoval', 'who', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'music', 'business', 'Ahmad', 'strangely', 'ambivalent', 'best', 'even', 'money', 'would', 'help', 'try', 'get', 'son', 'back', 'former', 'in-laws', 'also', 'see', 'Ahmad', 'start', 'somewhat', 'awkward', 'romance', 'young', 'Spanish', 'girl', 'Noemi', 'Leticia', 'Dolera', '.In', 'addition', 'look', 'excellent', 'performances', 'including', 'Ali', 'Reza', 'Manish', 'Arun', 'Lal', 'Ahmad', 'father-in-law.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'short', 'films', 'writer/director', 'Ramin', 'Bahrani', 'are', 'only', 'extras', 'get', 'are', 'extras', 'directly', 'related', 'Man', 'Push', 'Cart.I', 'recommend', 'Man', 'Push', 'Cart', 'fans', 'drama', 'independent', 'drama', 'and/or', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'America', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'film', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A

I took a quick glance at the premise of the movie, which sounded intriguing enough for me, so I picked it up. So glad I did.&#34;Man Push Cart&#34; (2005 release; 87 min.) brings the story of Ahmed, a Pakistani immigrant who sells coffee and breakfast from a push cart on the busy streets of Manhattan. As the movie opens, we see Ahmed getting ready at a very early hour for another long, hard day of selling breakfast. We see his regulars stopping by, and then also a new guy who immediately surmises that Ahmed is Pakistani, as he himself is also from Lahore, Pakistan. Even though the men are at very different ends of the economic (and social) spectrum, they start hanging out some, and eventually the man recognizes Ahmed from his days in Pakistan when Ahmed was a very successful rock singer (&#34;the Bono of Pakistan!&#34;, the man comments). In a parallel story, we get a peek into Ahmed's family situation, and he also befriends Noemi, an immigrant from Barcelona working at a nearby newsstand. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, as I started watching this, it wasn't clear to me whether this was a documentary or a fiction movie, that's how authentic this feels. It was actually a relief when I realized that it is fiction, as one cannot help but feel sorry for Ahmed's circumstances in life in general. Second, the movie plays out in Manhattan mostly, but also in Brooklyn and Queens, and as such the city of New York plays a huge role in the overall feel of the movie, with a rather harsh look (somehow reminiscent of &#34;Taxi Driver&#34;). Third, kudos to writer-director Ramin Bahrani for bringing us this slice of life, taking his time to developing the various characters and plot lines. This movie is definitely not for anyone in a hurry. Lastly, shouldn't the movie's title be &#34;Man Pull Cart&#34;? I mean, Ahmed actually never &#34;pushes&#34; the cart, but always pulls it.Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a character study that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. &#34;Man Push Cart&#34; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,4.5 stars... outstanding immigrant character study (and New York portrait),1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,2299,"['was', 'browsing', 'local', 'library', 'other', 'day', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'took', 'quick', 'glance', 'premise', 'movie', 'sounded', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'so', 'picked', 'up', 'glad', 'did.', '34', 'Man', 'Push', 'Cart', '34', '2005', 'release', '87', 'min', 'story', 'Ahmed', 'Pakistani', 'immigrant', 'who', 'coffee', 'breakfast', 'push', 'cart', 'busy', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'movie', 'see', 'Ahmed', 'getting', 'ready', 'very', 'early', 'hour', 'long', 'hard', 'day', 'selling', 'breakfast', 'see', 'regulars', 'stopping', 'then', 'also', 'new', 'guy', 'who', 'immediately', 'Ahmed', 'Pakistani', 'also', 'Lahore', 'Pakistan', 'Even', 'men', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'ends', 'economic', 'social', 'spectrum', 'start', 'hanging', 'out', 'eventually', 'man', 'Ahmed', 'days', 'Pakistan', 'when', 'Ahmed', 'was', 'very', 'successful', 'rock', 'singer', '34', 'Bono', 'Pakistan', '34', 'man', 'comments', 'parallel', 'story', 'get', 'peek', 'Ahmed', 'family', 'situation', 'also', 'Noemi', 'immigrant', 'Barcelona', 'working', 'nearby', 'newsstand', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'spoil', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'was', 'documentary', 'fiction', 'movie', 'how', 'authentic', 'feels', 'was', 'actually', 'relief', 'when', 'realized', 'fiction', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Ahmed', 'circumstances', 'life', 'general', 'Second', 'movie', 'out', 'Manhattan', 'mostly', 'also', 'Brooklyn', 'Queens', 'such', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'huge', 'role', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie', 'rather', 'harsh', 'look', 'somehow', 'reminiscent', '34', 'Taxi', 'Driver', '34', 'Third', 'kudos', 'writer-director', 'Ramin', 'Bahrani', 'bringing', 'slice', 'life', 'taking', 'time', 'developing', 'various', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'anyone', 'hurry', 'Lastly', 'should', ""n't"", 'movie', 'title', 'be', '34', 'Man', 'Pull', 'Cart', '34', 'mean', 'Ahmed', 'actually', 'never', '34', 'pushes', '34', 'cart', 'always', 'pulls', 'it.Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'mood', 'character', 'study', 'MILES', 'away', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', '34', 'Man', 'Push', 'Cart', '34', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

1091864,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000TSJ01I,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[2, 2]","This small film about a Pakistani street vendor in Manhattan packs a big emotional wallop. A quiet man of few words, Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi) seems imprisoned in his little coffee and bagel stand among elegant shops, going home nights to a little apartment in Brooklyn. Pulling the stand each pre-dawn morning cross town from the West Side and then back again at the end of the day, in the relentless flow of noisy traffic, he is (as director Ramin Bahrani points out in the commentary) like Sisyphus of Greek legend - endlessly repeating a heavy labor to keep complete meaninglessness at bay. There are only hints of back story to account for the look of defeat on his face, and only a few moments with a woman who works at a sidewalk newstand nearby that seem to trigger yearning for something new and hopeful in his life. Meanwhile, when he is extended a helping hand by a fellow Pakistani with a high-paying job and enough income for an apartment in town and a house in Westchester County, Ahmad experiences a kind of confusion that only reinforces his isolation.The camera, editing, and sound are done with all the sensitivity and control of the real cinephiles that the filmmakers seem to be. Shot in what the director calls an ""observational"" style, the film looks very much like a documentary, images caught on the fly with long lenses and scenes between characters often played out in single takes. Filmed in 30 days in the weeks before Christmas, ""Man Push Cart"" captures the chill and gloomy mid-day shadows of approaching winter  in Manhattan. Much of the footage on the street involves nonactors who didn't know they were being filmed (signing releases only afterwards). Director Bahrani and two of his crew with actor Razvi provide an interesting commentary on the DVD that should be an inspiration to young low-budget filmmakers.
