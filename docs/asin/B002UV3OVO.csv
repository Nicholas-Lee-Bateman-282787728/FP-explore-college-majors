According to the director, the film took 4 years to make and covers 84 shooting locations that took mules and 4x4s to reach.  And, Director Ciro Guerra has also said that people in Colombia didn't even know their country looked like this.The 2 hour film focuses on the sweeping panoramic landscapes, the many varieties of landscapes, something different appears constantly throughout the film.  It is about the characters and their deep sense of culture, beliefs and tradition.  It is about verbal/musical sparring and  challenges to claim the spot of best accordianist;  percussionist who are good enough to become baptized with the blood of a lizard; and a violent sword fight between two while the accordionist plays on.  And, of course it is about the music, the accordion.An old man and well-known troubadour Ignacio Carillo, whose wife has just died has come to grips that he needs to return his accordion back to the person he got it from, being that the accordion is cursed.  He takes a mule for the treks that will also be on foot, and by canoe crossing water.We don't learn much about his beliefs that the accordion is the devil and cursed.  He just seems adamant that it must go back.  A young teen, Fermin, has been encouraged by his mother to follow the man, to learn the accordion from the man.  The relationship is not completely a ""togetherness"", as young Fermin is discouraged by Ignacio from joining and following in his footsteps.Together, they encounter events where prize money is offered to play, as the journey leads to self-discover and different paths.  The journey is a long distance and although the film moves slowly, it is wonderful to absorb the culture and the life of musical troubadours, the music from Colombia, and to explore a side of the world I didn't know existed.  The cinematography is superb and continuously surprising.  The 2009 award winning film takes place circa late 60s.  It is distributed by FILM MOVEMENT Award-Winning Films and provides first run, independent and foreign films from the top festivals-Sundance, Cannes, Toronto;  Good directing and Good scripts  ...Rizzo",5,Colombia's panoramic unknown and unique landscapes!,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,2230,"['Never', 'foreign', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'such', 'varying', 'beautiful', 'cultural', 'landscapes', 'one', 'Colombia', 'According', 'director', 'film', 'took', '4', 'years', 'make', 'covers', '84', 'shooting', 'locations', 'took', 'mules', '4x4s', 'reach', 'Director', 'Ciro', 'Guerra', 'also', 'said', 'people', 'Colombia', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'country', 'looked', 'this.The', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'sweeping', 'panoramic', 'landscapes', 'many', 'varieties', 'landscapes', 'something', 'different', 'constantly', 'film', 'characters', 'deep', 'sense', 'culture', 'beliefs', 'tradition', 'about', 'verbal/musical', 'sparring', 'challenges', 'claim', 'spot', 'best', 'accordianist', 'percussionist', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'become', 'baptized', 'blood', 'lizard', 'violent', 'sword', 'fight', 'two', 'accordionist', 'course', 'music', 'accordion.An', 'old', 'man', 'well-known', 'troubadour', 'Ignacio', 'Carillo', 'wife', 'just', 'died', 'come', 'grips', 'return', 'accordion', 'back', 'person', 'got', 'being', 'accordion', 'cursed', 'mule', 'treks', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'foot', 'canoe', 'crossing', 'water.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'beliefs', 'accordion', 'devil', 'cursed', 'just', 'adamant', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'young', 'teen', 'Fermin', 'been', 'encouraged', 'mother', 'follow', 'man', 'learn', 'accordion', 'man', 'relationship', 'not', 'completely', 'togetherness', 'young', 'Fermin', 'discouraged', 'Ignacio', 'joining', 'following', 'footsteps.Together', 'encounter', 'events', 'where', 'prize', 'money', 'offered', 'play', 'journey', 'self-discover', 'different', 'paths', 'journey', 'long', 'distance', 'film', 'slowly', 'wonderful', 'absorb', 'culture', 'life', 'musical', 'troubadours', 'music', 'Colombia', 'explore', 'side', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'existed', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'continuously', 'surprising', '2009', 'award', 'winning', 'film', 'place', 'circa', 'late', '60s', 'distributed', 'FILM', 'MOVEMENT', 'Award-Winning', 'Films', 'first', 'run', 'independent', 'foreign', 'films', 'top', 'festivals-Sundance', 'Cannes', 'Toronto', 'Good', 'directing', 'Good', 'scripts', 'Rizzo']",N/A

Everything about it was perfectly done: casting, acting, locations, music, etc.  The filmmaker filled The Wind Journeys with breathtaking sights of the Colombian landscape and bewitching vallenato music.  Apart from just these technical aspects, the film also does magnificently.  Old man Ignacio (Marciano Mart&iacute;nez) and the young Fermin (Yull Nunez) play off each other very well and rhythmically.  Their relationship is relatable and touching from both ends; I watched the film with my grandmother and while she understood Ignacio's motives, I related to Fermin.

1290784,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B002UV3OVO,CGScammell,"[6, 7]","Ignacio's (played by Marciano Martinez) wife is buried at the start of this movie.  Silent, he grabs the black-horned accordion from his hut's wall, saddles his donkey and leaves town to return the accordion to its rightful owner.  It's this long-standing promise that drives this movie.  He ignores the children who follow him to the village end, but one determined teen, Fermin (Yull Nunez), stays with him. Fermin wants to learn the accordion from Ignacio, but Ignacio refuses to play the instrument ever again, saying it is cursed by the devil; that whoever plays from it is doomed to travel the rest of his life from village to village to play it for others' enjoyment.  Fermin doesn't take ""No"" for an answer. Fermin's own father was a troubador he never met. So Ignacio gives him one challenge after the other to test his will.  A Mentor-student journey begins that is at times touching, brutal and honest.What follows then is at times a slow-moving plot across some of the most spectacular landscapes I've seen of Colombia.  And just as the title suggests, there is always wind blowing in the background.  If the wind isn't blowing, the accordion is playing.  The duo travel from village to village, meet lots of stares and silent greetings along the way as cultures clash and family feuds are met by the sword.  Ignacio's days as a troubador are well-remembered by the elders in the villages along this sweeping journey across golden steppes, misty mountain sides and tidal shores.There's an underlying spiritual tone to this movie.  The accordion is the primary musical instrument in Colombian vallenato music, a musical style resembling a salsa-rumba beat.  Accordions and bongo drums are the primary sounds of this musical style along the northern Colombian coastal areas. To be able to play this music well is quite an honor. Ignacio never does teach Fermin how to play the accordion; Fermin learns by watching him.  He has other musical talents that come out in this movie.There are several long scenes of musical performances that always contrast to the rest of the movie's wind-swept quiet scenes of stoic dialogues and silent walks across mountain passes and steppes.  Eventually the duo meet Ignacio's mountainman brother who fixes the accordion so that the duo can continue the trek to the Maestro's house, the rightful owner of the accordion.  At around 30 minutes into the film (in the episode called ""Battle""), we see Ignacio play and we understand why he gained the troubadour honor.  The man can play the accordion with mucho gusto.  ""It's not me that plays, it's the accordion"" says Ignacio to Fermin.Just when I wondered where the movie was going with its plot (it's 1:50 hours long!) something would perk me up again.  Words and deeds are done that make the viewer wonder what is going on.The promise of returning the accordion is completed.  The movie ends with an unknown message from the Maestro but we never know what is in the message.  This open-end is something I'm seeing a lot in contemporary South American movies.It's a slow-moving movie at times but the scenery and the message had me spellbound all throughout the movie.  It's a refreshingly pure movie so unlike the many more shootemups exported by Colombia and well worth a critical review by anyone who enjoys Latin cultures.",4,A surrealistic roadtrip across Colombia,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,3318,"['Ignacio', 'played', 'Marciano', 'Martinez', 'wife', 'buried', 'start', 'movie', 'Silent', 'grabs', 'black-horned', 'accordion', 'hut', 'wall', 'donkey', 'town', 'return', 'accordion', 'rightful', 'owner', 'long-standing', 'promise', 'movie', 'children', 'who', 'follow', 'village', 'end', 'one', 'determined', 'teen', 'Fermin', 'Yull', 'Nunez', 'Fermin', 'learn', 'accordion', 'Ignacio', 'Ignacio', 'play', 'instrument', 'ever', 'again', 'saying', 'cursed', 'devil', 'whoever', 'doomed', 'travel', 'rest', 'life', 'village', 'village', 'play', 'others', 'enjoyment', 'Fermin', ""n't"", 'take', 'No', 'answer', 'Fermin', 'own', 'father', 'was', 'troubador', 'never', 'met', 'So', 'Ignacio', 'one', 'challenge', 'other', 'test', 'will', 'Mentor-student', 'journey', 'times', 'touching', 'brutal', 'honest.What', 'then', 'times', 'slow-moving', 'plot', 'most', 'spectacular', 'landscapes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Colombia', 'just', 'title', 'always', 'wind', 'blowing', 'background', 'wind', ""n't"", 'blowing', 'accordion', 'playing', 'duo', 'travel', 'village', 'village', 'meet', 'lots', 'stares', 'silent', 'greetings', 'way', 'cultures', 'clash', 'family', 'feuds', 'are', 'met', 'sword', 'Ignacio', 'days', 'troubador', 'are', 'well-remembered', 'elders', 'villages', 'sweeping', 'journey', 'golden', 'steppes', 'misty', 'mountain', 'sides', 'tidal', 'shores.There', 'underlying', 'spiritual', 'tone', 'movie', 'accordion', 'primary', 'musical', 'instrument', 'Colombian', 'vallenato', 'music', 'musical', 'style', 'resembling', 'salsa-rumba', 'beat', 'Accordions', 'bongo', 'drums', 'are', 'primary', 'sounds', 'musical', 'style', 'northern', 'Colombian', 'coastal', 'areas', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'music', 'well', 'quite', 'honor', 'Ignacio', 'never', 'teach', 'Fermin', 'how', 'play', 'accordion', 'Fermin', 'watching', 'other', 'musical', 'talents', 'come', 'out', 'are', 'several', 'long', 'scenes', 'musical', 'performances', 'always', 'contrast', 'rest', 'movie', 'wind-swept', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'stoic', 'dialogues', 'silent', 'walks', 'mountain', 'passes', 'steppes', 'Eventually', 'duo', 'meet', 'Ignacio', 'mountainman', 'brother', 'who', 'accordion', 'duo', 'can', 'continue', 'trek', 'Maestro', 'house', 'rightful', 'owner', 'accordion', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'episode', 'called', 'Battle', 'see', 'Ignacio', 'play', 'understand', 'why', 'gained', 'troubadour', 'honor', 'man', 'can', 'play', 'accordion', 'mucho', 'gusto', 'not', 'accordion', 'Ignacio', 'Fermin.Just', 'when', 'wondered', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'plot', '1:50', 'hours', 'long', 'something', 'would', 'perk', 'up', 'again', 'Words', 'deeds', 'are', 'done', 'make', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'promise', 'returning', 'accordion', 'completed', 'movie', 'unknown', 'message', 'Maestro', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'message', 'open-end', 'something', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'lot', 'contemporary', 'South', 'American', 'movies.It', 'slow-moving', 'movie', 'times', 'scenery', 'message', 'had', 'movie', 'refreshingly', 'pure', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'shootemups', 'exported', 'Colombia', 'well', 'critical', 'review', 'anyone', 'who', 'Latin', 'cultures']",N/A

Prior to that I lived in Seattle, but that doesn't matter to this discussion. It was while living in Palm Springs that I began to learn how important the accordion is in Mexican music. This is apparently due to a large number of German settlers who ended up in Northern Mexico and brought their music with them. What I hadn't known until seeing this movie was how big accordions apparently are even in places farther south than Mexico, like Colombia, the setting of this latest movie from Film Movement.This isn't the Colombia you're used to seeing in TV and movies. It's not the Colombia of drug lords or revolutionaries. No, it's the Colombia of people living in small towns, eking out a meager existence and enjoying some very interesting music.The movie tells the story of Ignacio, a renowned accordion player, who leaves on a mission to return a horned accordion (don't ask), to its rightful owner. Tagging along is a teenage boy who wants to learn how to play the accordion so that he can impress a girl back home. Why Ignacio didn't just send the thing via UPS is beyond me, but I guess if he had, we wouldn't have had a story.To a great extent this film reminds me of a martial arts movie, or a Western. You have the old master and the young, would-be apprentice traveling along together on a Mission of Great Importance. Except in Spanish. With accordions.There's a great many fascinating elements to this movie. I particularly liked a scene where there's an accordion duel that was not entirely unlike the rap duels featured in ""8 Mile"". Except in Spanish. With accordions. I also really loved the scenery, which showed Colombia as having a far more diverse environment than I'd expected.This was a very entertaining, if not perfect, movie. It does drag a bit in the first and third acts, but otherwise is full-on. Besides, where else will you see an accordion duel?=== Short Subject ===This month's short subject is a film called ""Danzak"" from Peru. It centers around a ten-year-old girl whose father is dying. He's a dancer who uses a device not unlike scissors in his dancing. He asks his daughter to round up some people so that he can have one last dance, while her mother runs around doing everything she can to get him medicine so that he can live just a little longer.This was a really great short film. I'd never heard of this kind of dancing and found it to be really interesting, plus it was cool hearing a language, Quechua, that I've not heard before. It's a good compliment to the main feature and a decent stand-alone piece.",4,See?

1290790,A7BMU8ZJJ77I0,B002UV3OVO,Mithridates VI of Pontus,"[8, 8]","On strong recommendation from my sister I finally got around to seeing this unusual Colombian film.  I have to admit, I know very little about Spanish language cinema (especially from the Americas).  Regardless, I found The Wind Journeys a fascinating experience -- one I suspect I would have appreciated even more if I knew the cultural background to the gorgeous tableux unfolding so majestically before my eyes.  The cinematography, gorgeous scenery, moving music, and the slight surrealist (perhaps too strong of a word) edge merits finding this film!Brief Plot Summary (limited spoilers)Ignacio Carrillo, a Colombian folk singer, decides to give up his accordion and return it to his teacher.  His accordion, decked out with devilish horns, is supposedly cursed -- taking over whoever plays it.As he departs his small town, Fermin, a teenage boy who wishes to learn how to play the accordion (I can't precisely figure out Fermin's motivation), sets off after him.  The relationship between the two characters is the emotional center of the film and by far the most interesting plot related element.  They set off across the visually arresting geography of Colombia (absolutely gorgeous) meeting unusual people -- engaging in accordion ""duels"".  In one of the most memorable scenes involves Ignacio reluctantly playing his accordion for two men settling their scores on a bridge by hacking at each other with machetes...  The cinematography is SUPERB throughout heightening the power of these unusual sequences.Ignacio is extraordinarily reluctant to play his cursed instrument.  Likewise, he is reluctant to teach Fermin (perhaps in order to prevent him from turning into the gruff man old man he has become).  The last sequence of the film further complicates the relationship between the two main characters and is ultimately somewhat ambiguous.  The plot is definitely not the fulcrum of the experience.  Revel in the feel of this timelessly world...  Revel in the artistry of every image....Final ThoughtsI must admit, I finished somewhat unsatisfied by the experience.  Perhaps because I am at loss regarding the cultural aspects of the film.  Perhaps because I was so enraptured by the beauty of every image I concentrated more on what I saw on the surface than prying deeper -- but I feel somewhat adrift and unable to do so.Yes, the basic elements we are so familier with are here: the young boy, the gruff yet wise old man, the sage on the mountain top (an accordion repair man), a quest, every changing scenery, unusual duels and tests of ""manliness"" (whatever form that might take).  At its most superficial the film is approachable.  But I am lacking the knowledge to see the slight manipulations (cultural perhaps) of the archetype.  I want to know more...  The experience was worthwhile...
