How can people behave this way?  Where is sanity and justice and morality?  Do these terms even have relevance in the face of furious and indifferent cruelty.  The wife's love and determination is nearly overwhelmed by the fear and violence surrounding her.A very competent cast does well, with Adrien Brody a standout.  But this is a director's showcase and Elie Chouraqui and company do an outstanding job in shaking out our complacency and reminding us again of the horrors of that nasty little conflict and its ""ethnic cleansing"" thugs and monsters.",4,A Journey through Hell on Earth....,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,1263,"['wife', 'photojournalist', 'thought', 'killed', 'early', 'days', 'Yugoslavian', 'civil', 'war', 'husband', 'still', 'alive', 'rashly', 'way', 'heart', 'hellish', 'conflict', 'aid', 'other', 'cynical', 'war', 'photographers.You', 'may', 'find', 'premise', 'bit', 'incredible', 'make', 'leap', 'faith', 'character', 'wife', 'will', 'take', 'journey', 'Hell', 'earth', 'shock', 'stun', 'sophisticated', 'yet', 'naive', 'middle-class', 'American', 'woman.The', 'film', 'accomplishes', 'something', 'important', 'take', 'place', 'time', 'events', 'think', 'know', 'shove', 'consciousness', 'shock', 'new', 'How', 'can', 'people', 'behave', 'way', 'Where', 'sanity', 'justice', 'morality', 'Do', 'terms', 'even', 'have', 'relevance', 'face', 'furious', 'indifferent', 'cruelty', 'wife', 'love', 'determination', 'nearly', 'overwhelmed', 'fear', 'violence', 'surrounding', 'her.A', 'very', 'competent', 'cast', 'well', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'standout', 'director', 'showcase', 'Elie', 'Chouraqui', 'company', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'shaking', 'out', 'complacency', 'reminding', 'again', 'horrors', 'nasty', 'little', 'conflict', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'thugs', 'monsters']",Harrison's Flowers

I disagree with the claim that the movie was unrealistic.  For example, sneaking past the snipers by crawling through the brush a hundred yards away is not incredible as depicted.  And smiling at the checkpoints was a good rouse: it made the sentries think the journalists were on their side, so of course they wanted them to take their pictures.The purpose of the movie seemed to be mainly to describe, to show the human costs of war.  No attempt at understanding this particular war, just showing the atrocities.  At least they had the decency to say that BOTH sides were committing atrocities.  Usually, in American movies it's only the Serbs that are the bad guys.Another fair-minded and human-level film, made by a Yugoslav, isSavior.It's all very well to say that war is bad, but we already know that.  The question is, what do you do when you are attacked?  This is what Americans are still arguing about.  We had better figure it out.

715942,A2HOLM5I1ARX9J,B00006HAX6,"Carol C. ""ccjello""","[4, 5]","Reviewer: A viewer from Kansas City, MOThis gripping film is a tribute to the 40+ journalists who died covering the war in the Balkans. The story centers around Andie MacDowell's character's search for her Pulitzer-award-winning photographer husband, who was reportedly killed when a building collapses in the war. Sarah Lloyd (Andie) is convinced that her husband is still alive, so she leaves behind her two young children & her job at Newsweek to venture to Serb-held Vukovar to find him. Her journey is fraught with violence -- shortly after she crosses into Yugoslavia, she encounters a Serb roadblock, where her hitchhiker/passenger/guide, a charming Croatian student in Paris returning to find his wife & baby, is needlessly executed, the rented Audi is crushed by a tank, and Sarah barely escapes rape. She is ""rescued"" by fellow journalists, and undaunted, continues her seeming suicide mission to find her husband in Vukovar. The violence in this film rivals anything you'll find on screen (think two hours of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan) and you'll hear the ... word at least once a minute -- but it is well worth seeing. It will foster an appreciation of what photojournalists go through to document history, putting themselves at risk certainly as much as the soldiers, without the support & protection of an Army being them (albeit voluntarily). My only concern is that the film may oversimplify the issues underlying the conflict -- it depicts Serbs as evil and Croats as - - well, not evil, providing a relatively safe haven for the journalists. However, the film is not so much about the conflict itself as it is about the sacrifices of the journalists covering the conflict.",4,tribute to journalists who died covering the Balkan conflict,1047686400,"03 15, 2003",2003,1705,"['Reviewer', 'viewer', 'Kansas', 'City', 'MOThis', 'gripping', 'film', 'tribute', '40+', 'journalists', 'who', 'died', 'covering', 'war', 'Balkans', 'story', 'centers', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'character', 'search', 'Pulitzer-award-winning', 'photographer', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'reportedly', 'killed', 'when', 'building', 'war', 'Sarah', 'Lloyd', 'Andie', 'convinced', 'husband', 'still', 'alive', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'job', 'Newsweek', 'venture', 'Serb-held', 'Vukovar', 'find', 'journey', 'fraught', 'violence', 'shortly', 'Yugoslavia', 'Serb', 'roadblock', 'where', 'hitchhiker/passenger/guide', 'charming', 'Croatian', 'student', 'Paris', 'returning', 'find', 'wife', 'baby', 'needlessly', 'executed', 'rented', 'Audi', 'crushed', 'tank', 'Sarah', 'barely', 'rape', 'rescued', 'fellow', 'journalists', 'undaunted', 'seeming', 'suicide', 'mission', 'find', 'husband', 'Vukovar', 'violence', 'film', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'find', 'screen', 'think', 'two', 'hours', 'opening', 'scene', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'word', 'least', 'once', 'minute', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'will', 'foster', 'appreciation', 'what', 'photojournalists', 'go', 'document', 'history', 'putting', 'risk', 'certainly', 'as', 'much', 'soldiers', 'support', 'protection', 'Army', 'being', 'voluntarily', 'only', 'concern', 'film', 'may', 'oversimplify', 'issues', 'underlying', 'conflict', 'Serbs', 'evil', 'Croats', 'well', 'not', 'evil', 'providing', 'relatively', 'safe', 'haven', 'journalists', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'conflict', 'sacrifices', 'journalists', 'covering', 'conflict']",Harrison's Flowers

This film is filled with drama and suspense, as we see the realities of war and those who fall victim to the tyrany and oppression.

Brody practically steals every scene he's in as bitter but dedicated photojournalist Kyle Morris, who's grieving for a friend and fellow photographer killed in the Balkan war yet still manages to help Sarah Lloyd (Andie MacDowell in a nicely understated performance) find her presumed-dead husband Harrison (David Strathairn, who doesn't get much to do except look earnest, but is a likable presence all the same. My husband, accustomed to seeing him as bad guys in DOLORES CLAIBORNE and others, found it refreshing to see Strathairn in a sympathetic role for a change), who's a prize-winning photojournalist on one last job for Newsweek. Brody's Kyle is a fascinating bundle of contradictions, in a realistic way. (For one thing, it's kind of refreshing to see that Kyle is not immediately vilified for abusing cocaine at one point in the film -- although my smart-aleck hubby couldn't resist a wisecrack about the amount of coke needed to fill a nose like Brody's! Men! :-) As a mom, I was troubled that Sarah was willing to leave her two children at the drop of a hat to go to Croatia to look for Harrison. Yeah, she left the kiddies with her mom (always nice to see 1960s fave Diane Baker get work), but what if Harrison was indeed dead and then Sarah went and got herself killed, too? I can hear the kids now: ""So we're orphans because Mom loved Dad so much she went off to the war zone herself instead of getting the Red Cross or something to help her find him? Thanks for nothing, Mom!""  BTW, HARRISON'S FLOWERS is the second film in a row (after BREAD AND ROSES) in which Adrien Brody sports bedhead and a beard, lending him a cuddly look even in his most intense moments, IMO. If I may allow my hormones to do the talking for a moment, Brody might want to consider playing more roles where he gets to look like that! :-)",3,"MacDowell, Brody & Gleeson are Great Even When Film Isn't",1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,2075,"['Stirring', 'war', 'drama', '+', 'sappy', 'love', 'story', 'rather', 'tunnel-visioned', 'heroine', '+', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'always-excellent', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', '=', 'film', 'watchable', 'enough', 'cable', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'not', '100', '%', 'satisfying', 'Brody', 'practically', 'scene', 'bitter', 'dedicated', 'photojournalist', 'Kyle', 'Morris', 'who', 'grieving', 'friend', 'fellow', 'photographer', 'killed', 'Balkan', 'war', 'yet', 'still', 'help', 'Sarah', 'Lloyd', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'nicely', 'understated', 'performance', 'find', 'presumed-dead', 'husband', 'Harrison', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'do', 'look', 'earnest', 'likable', 'presence', 'same', 'husband', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'bad', 'guys', 'DOLORES', 'CLAIBORNE', 'others', 'found', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Strathairn', 'sympathetic', 'role', 'change', 'who', 'prize-winning', 'photojournalist', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'Newsweek', 'Brody', 'Kyle', 'fascinating', 'bundle', 'contradictions', 'realistic', 'way', 'one', 'thing', 'kind', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Kyle', 'not', 'immediately', 'vilified', 'abusing', 'cocaine', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'smart-aleck', 'hubby', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'wisecrack', 'amount', 'coke', 'needed', 'fill', 'nose', 'Brody', 'Men', 'mom', 'was', 'troubled', 'Sarah', 'was', 'willing', 'leave', 'two', 'children', 'drop', 'hat', 'go', 'Croatia', 'look', 'Harrison', 'Yeah', 'left', 'kiddies', 'mom', 'always', 'nice', 'see', '1960s', 'fave', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'get', 'work', 'what', 'Harrison', 'was', 'indeed', 'dead', 'then', 'Sarah', 'went', 'got', 'killed', 'too', 'can', 'hear', 'kids', 'now', ""'re"", 'orphans', 'Mom', 'loved', 'Dad', 'so', 'much', 'went', 'off', 'war', 'zone', 'instead', 'getting', 'Red', 'Cross', 'something', 'help', 'find', 'Thanks', 'nothing', 'Mom', 'BTW', 'HARRISON', 'FLOWERS', 'second', 'film', 'row', 'BREAD', 'AND', 'ROSES', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'sports', 'bedhead', 'beard', 'lending', 'cuddly', 'look', 'even', 'most', 'intense', 'moments', 'IMO', 'may', 'allow', 'hormones', 'do', 'talking', 'moment', 'Brody', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'playing', 'more', 'roles', 'where', 'look']",Harrison's Flowers

715948,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00006HAX6,Joseph Haschka,"[4, 6]","Andie MacDowell is an engaging actress whose films I don't see often enough, yet am gratified when I do. In HARRISON'S FLOWERS, MacDowell plays Sarah Lloyd, the wife of Pulitzer prize-winning photographer Harrison Lloyd (David Strathairn). Both work for Newsweek.Early on, Harrison is persuaded by his boss to take on one last assignment into harm's way. (This worn out plot device may cause the viewer to cringe. But, let's move on.) So, off Harrison goes with his camera gear to the debris field that was Yugoslavia. It's 1991, and the Croats and Serbs are at each other's throats. A couple weeks later, Sarah receives word that her husband was apparently killed in a building collapse. However, in her gut she believes him to be still alive. So, off she jets to the war zone, leaving her two young children behind, to bring hubby home.After arriving in Graz, Austria, Sarah rents a car with the intent of driving to Vukovar, where she hopes to find Harrison in the local hospital. In the rental lot, she offers a ride to a young Yugoslav returning from Paris to find his wife. Soon after transiting the border, they cross paths with a rampaging tank accompanied by some very nasty troops, and Sarah is horrifically initiated into the brutal realities of the Serbo-Croat civil war.In Sarah's subsequent tortuous quest into Hell, Andie's character takes a back seat to those gamely played by Adrien Brody (Kyle Morris) and Brendan Gleeson (Mark Stevenson), media photographers who take Sarah under their wings while moving her forward. For her part, Sarah seems emotionally and psychologically dazed amidst the sudden, random violence and rains of aerial bombs and artillery shells.HARRISON'S FLOWERS is a gritty, tense and powerful tale in which the French director, Elie Chouraqui, makes no attempt to enlighten the audience on the cultural gulf separating Serb and Croat or the genesis of this particular inter-tribal slaughter. And, for insular U.S. audiences constantly puzzled by Balkan excesses, it probably doesn't matter - all the combatants are crazy.It's hard to say if the blood lust of the region is realistically depicted or not.

The Yugoslav war definitely stands out for war photographers as something special, good or bad, it was special for them.Onto the movie, FRENCH/PAL version vs. American release.  Hands down the FRENCH version is superior and it was VERY difficult to find when I bought it, now there's a few copies floating around...When I saw the French version only a few years ago and the American version 10 years ago, I automatically felt like someone was treating Americans like children in the way the American/HBO (and DVD) version was watered down, there must be at least 15 minutes less, entire characters and their stories are cut out, and even the entire musical score is different.  The French version has some generic synthesizer music and the American version has some violin music throughout, the only plus for the American version.The PAL/French release however is far superior, you can see great actors such as Brendan Gleeson, Elias Koteas, Caroline Goodall, and even Gerard Butler give these cutaway type interviews in between the action from the eyes of War Photogs (and their families) which they totally cut out of the American version.  I can understand why they watered down the American version, they made the story more concise and about Andie McDowel's journey to fight her husband which can be a plus depending which way you look at it.  But personally, after seeing the American version and the French version (this version I'm reviewing) I'll recommend everything about the French version except the original score which was generic and not very special, the rest, is just a deeper look into the conflict, a deeper look into the mentality of war photographers under fire, and the story of Andie McDowell finding ""Harrison"" is almost second to the war itself.If you like Harrison Flowers (USA) you'll really at least find Harrison's Flowers (REGION 2) interesting, if not totally awesome.Just get it!",5,"GET THIS PAL/FRENCH VERSION, the USA VERSION IS DUMBED DOWN...",1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,2419,"['Okay', 'hear', 'out', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Harrison', 'flowers', 'HBO', 'almost', 'decade', 'was', 'enthralled', 'being', 'photographer', 'war', 'buff', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'see', 'portrayal', 'war', 'photographers', 'work', 'what', 'was', '90', 'biggest', 'war', 'correspondents', 'sense', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'conflicts', 'were', 'free', 'roam', 'get', 'shots', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'being', 'embedded', 'US', 'troops', 'Desert', 'Storm', 'be', 'constant', 'bombardment', 'Russia', 'Grozny', 'Chechnya', 'Yugoslav', 'war', 'definitely', 'out', 'war', 'photographers', 'something', 'special', 'good', 'bad', 'was', 'special', 'movie', 'FRENCH/PAL', 'version', 'vs.', 'American', 'release', 'down', 'FRENCH', 'version', 'superior', 'was', 'VERY', 'difficult', 'find', 'when', 'bought', 'now', 'few', 'copies', 'floating', 'around', 'When', 'saw', 'French', 'version', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'American', 'version', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'automatically', 'felt', 'someone', 'was', 'treating', 'Americans', 'children', 'way', 'American/HBO', 'DVD', 'version', 'was', 'watered', 'down', 'must', 'be', 'least', '15', 'minutes', 'less', 'entire', 'characters', 'stories', 'are', 'cut', 'out', 'even', 'entire', 'musical', 'score', 'different', 'French', 'version', 'generic', 'synthesizer', 'music', 'American', 'version', 'violin', 'music', 'only', 'plus', 'American', 'version.The', 'PAL/French', 'release', 'however', 'far', 'superior', 'can', 'see', 'great', 'actors', 'such', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'Caroline', 'Goodall', 'even', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'give', 'cutaway', 'type', 'interviews', 'action', 'eyes', 'War', 'Photogs', 'families', 'totally', 'cut', 'American', 'version', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'watered', 'down', 'American', 'version', 'made', 'story', 'more', 'concise', 'Andie', 'McDowel', 'journey', 'fight', 'husband', 'can', 'be', 'depending', 'way', 'look', 'personally', 'seeing', 'American', 'version', 'French', 'version', 'version', ""'m"", 'reviewing', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'everything', 'French', 'version', 'original', 'score', 'was', 'generic', 'not', 'very', 'special', 'rest', 'just', 'deeper', 'look', 'conflict', 'deeper', 'look', 'mentality', 'war', 'photographers', 'fire', 'story', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'finding', 'Harrison', 'almost', 'second', 'war', 'itself.If', 'Harrison', 'Flowers', 'USA', ""'ll"", 'really', 'least', 'find', 'Harrison', 'Flowers', 'REGION', '2', 'interesting', 'not', 'totally', 'awesome.Just', 'get']",Harrison's Flowers
715952,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00006HAX6,Patrick L. Randall,"[5, 8]","""Harrison's Flowers"" would be complete and utter cinematic dreck were it not for the fact that it presents an honest and unflinching portrayal of the extreme dangers faced by the brave men and women who covered the Balkan Wars in the early to mid `90s.  That harrowing depiction of the journalists and photojournalists aside, ""Harrison's Flowers"" is not even close to being a good enough movie to recommend.The story of this film centers on the disappearance of gifted photojournalist, Harrison Lloyd (David Straitharn), while covering for Newsweek civil conflict in the former Yugoslavia.  It is presumed by everyone that Harrison was captured and executed by aggressive rebels along with a number of other innocents.  Everyone assumes he is dead, except his wife, Sarah (Andie MacDowell), who believes she saw him in obscure camera footage recorded after his supposed death and believes him to be alive.  So, she decides to take off on a quest to bring Harrison back home alive.  Among those who end up assisting her in this goal is Harrison's professional rival, Kyle (Adrien Brody), and a few other photojournalists played by Elias Koteas and Brendan Gleeson.Let's stop for a minute and analyze what is taking place.  Sarah Lloyd is a typical soccer mom who understands her husband's chosen career and the dangers inherent in it, but she has no knowledge of how to perform that job.  Yet, now she wants to go on a crusade to rescue to her husband in a foreign land where outsiders are raped, assaulted, and murdered just for fun.  She does this even though she has young children who need to be looked after and are already reeling from the supposed loss of one parent.  Sarah has no knowledge, experience, or support that would make anyone think she has a remote chance of achieving her goal, let alone surviving.  She just flies off blindly on a mission that could very likely leave her children as orphans.Interestingly enough, that display of complete irresponsibility is not even the worst part of this film.  What really undermines this film is a smattering of unexplained and unnecessary characters, plot developments straight from the `clich&eacute; handbook', and a truly atrocious performance by the lead who plays Sarah, Andie MacDowell.  While there is no disputing MacDowell's ability to convey Sarah's grief, that is all the range that MacDowell shows throughout the whole movie.  It's impossible to believe that this woman who seems to have no emotions other than crying, whining, and shrieking could be able to be functional enough to even go on this quest, let alone succeed in it.  She seems truly and utterly helpless and the audience cannot make a great enough leap to believe that her undying love (and help from a few colleagues) would be enough to guide her to Harrison.The plot developments from `clich&eacute;s `R Us' includes such tired conventions as one character being too scared to move out of the line of fire, so a brave character goes to save him and gets shot instead.  Uggh!  I saw that turn of events coming a mile away, and so will anyone will any movie-going experience.  Among the superfluous characters is an eager young Balkan gentleman who is bent on providing transportation to Sarah once she lands in country and seems to have been authorized by someone to provide that assistance.  Yet, there are no further allusions made to what this character's purpose is and when he's killed three minutes later, he is all but forgotten.  Such a character can be explained if this were a documentary or based on a actual people and events, but in a fictional drama, it's just distracting.This incredibly trite, implausible story would garner a one-star rating if it were not for the uncompromising depiction of the Balkan War.  Perhaps if the filmmakers had decided to change to the focus and deal strictly with the war and its atrocities, then they might have had something.  Instead, they use a real tragedy to play backdrop to a threadbare love story.

When a world-famous photographer is reported killed in the war-torn former Yugoslavia, his wife flies off from their comfortable home in Westchester to find him and bring him back alive. The best that can be said about this Hollywood-style storyline is that it provides a reason to accomplish something very different - to portray the ghastly truth of ethnic warfare as it took place in the Balkans in the early 1990s and the role of news photographers who risked their lives to capture it with their cameras.Plunged into Croatia as Vukovar was being overrun by Serbs, the characters take the audience into a hell where everyone - men, women, children - must kill or be killed. We are witness to atrocities and inhumanities that take the breath away. While war in the movies has often been played for thrill-packed adventure - even anti-war films - this one leaves you with a sense of powerlessness in the face of unimaginable horror. Urban warfare and ethnic cleansing cease being abstract concepts.

There is the Hollywood tinsel, of course, and it has it's awkwardly cheesy moments, but when the bullets start flying and the cameras start snapping...you'll be hooked.The first time I saw this, I only caught the second half. It grabbed me enough to make me want to buy it, so naturally I came here. Some of the stuff in this movie are hard to take. You watch a masked soldier chasing what you assume to be a teacher and her students into a building. He waits for them all to go inside, and then lobs a grenade inside after them. And it tears at your soul to know that these things happen. It's less of a brooding retrospective look at conflict as it is a disturbing social commentary on indifference, and those who oppose it. The movie is ABOUT love, but to me it takes a backseat to the bigger picture, and I think it would have been much better without it.A little girl in a yellow dress waving and smiling at the photographer's as they pass in a car. Later you see the same little girl lying at the steps of a blown-out bus, raped and murdered. It's a morbid, depressing movie, and I think the love story was meant to offset this, and try to bring balance, that even through the worst of things, the best remains.

715958,A1MG93B9L0QTQA,B00006HAX6,"S. A. Farley ""sally1590""","[1, 3]","The plot is shaky, unrealistic - A beautiful, loving wife (Andie MacDowell) of a photo journalist (David Strathairn) is determined to find her husband, who is presumed dead in war-torn Yugoslavia.  What makes this implausible is that the wife's character displays no previous signs of strength and determination before her perilous journey to Europe.  She's pretty much the standard working/soccer mom type in a minivan before her husband's disappearance.  Therefore her character isn't properly developed to convince the viewer of her strength to undertake such a dangerous mission.The strongest performance is Adrien Brody.  He's an embittered, jealous small-time photo-journalist who hasn't reached the notorious ranks of Harrison Lloyd (Strathairn) et al.  He swears a lot, he's unkempt, agitated.  His performance in this film is a scene stealer - a foreshadowing of an up and coming career for Mr. Brody.Underused are David Strathairn (always a fine performance consisting of subtle facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice) and Elias Koteas - what can I say about him?  He's enigmatic, there's something about him - wry, natural, fun.Ms. MacDowell's acting has been mediocre, at best, in the past, but she shows promise here.  I suspect her natural-looking beauty distracts viewers from a natural-feeling performance.I feel the father-son relationship wasn't emphasized as much as it should have been.The war horrors are shocking, atrocious, gruesome.It's a so-so movie that could have been better.",3,Somber story of love overcoming dangers of war,1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,1508,"['plot', 'shaky', 'unrealistic', 'beautiful', 'loving', 'wife', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'photo', 'journalist', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'determined', 'find', 'husband', 'who', 'presumed', 'dead', 'war-torn', 'Yugoslavia', 'What', 'implausible', 'wife', 'character', 'previous', 'signs', 'strength', 'determination', 'perilous', 'journey', 'Europe', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'working/soccer', 'mom', 'type', 'minivan', 'husband', 'disappearance', 'character', ""n't"", 'properly', 'developed', 'convince', 'viewer', 'strength', 'undertake', 'such', 'dangerous', 'mission.The', 'strongest', 'performance', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'embittered', 'jealous', 'small-time', 'photo-journalist', 'who', ""n't"", 'reached', 'notorious', 'ranks', 'Harrison', 'Lloyd', 'Strathairn', 'et', 'al', 'lot', 'unkempt', 'agitated', 'performance', 'film', 'scene', 'stealer', 'foreshadowing', 'up', 'coming', 'career', 'Mr.', 'Brody.Underused', 'are', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'always', 'fine', 'performance', 'consisting', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'tone', 'voice', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'enigmatic', 'something', 'wry', 'natural', 'fun.Ms', 'MacDowell', 'acting', 'been', 'mediocre', 'best', 'past', 'promise', 'here', 'suspect', 'natural-looking', 'beauty', 'distracts', 'viewers', 'natural-feeling', 'performance.I', 'feel', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'was', ""n't"", 'emphasized', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'been.The', 'war', 'horrors', 'are', 'shocking', 'atrocious', 'so-so', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",Harrison's Flowers
715959,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00006HAX6,Shashank Tripathi,"[1, 3]","Yes it's kind of a corn-fed theme, but imagine a warring Yugoslavia from fifteen years ago. As its city of Vukovar is being ripped to smithereens, our Newsweek journalist goes MIA. This sets sets up the perfect pretext for his New Yorker wife, played by a suitably melancholy Andie McDowell (also a journalist, which made me wonder about their ten bedroom house), to take a flying trip into the thick of all that macabre action.I sat tight hoping for what promised to be a gritty love-during-war film with an Eastern European twist, but all it really was was a dress rehearsal for Adrien Brody's award-winning cameo in The Pianist two years afterward.My problems began when voice-overs of all the characters sprung up in the middle of the script. A curious narrative technique for a theme of this nature. Just when you were in the moment feeling dumbstruck with what you had just seen, out came someone in candid camera reminiscing after the fact. Smacks to me of an eleventh hour decision made during post-production, or a failed stunt to lend a realistic tone to the film (we are told it is based on real events).As a War-is-Evil statement it succeeds to an extent in depicting some heinous atrocities of war, supported amply by a brilliant score, but I left with no more appreciation for the ethnic belligerence in the Balkans than I had before the film. ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" or ""No Man's Land"" have stricken a lot more strident note in that regard.While our motley crew of reporters meandered through cavernous cities, the romantic undercurrent held my interest in parts but unravelled much too slowly, leaving enough time for some key melodrama to unfold. In a sloppy finale, when the Mr. Harrison of the title is found and brought back to the warmth of his humongous family house, all his remnant trauma is resolved much too quickly. Other than a few magical flowers it is rather unclear what brought about his turnaround.Much of my three-star appreciation for the film goes to the cinematographers for evoking a smoking war zone which includes some very difficult shoots through a nightmarish countryside. The 48 journalists that the DVD tells us were killed during the conflict had a clear purpose to leave a memory of the war for posterity, but the purpose of this commemorative film is anyone's guess.",3,GRITTY WAR BITS BUT A VAPID LOVE STORY,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,2312,"['Yes', 'kind', 'corn-fed', 'theme', 'imagine', 'warring', 'Yugoslavia', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'city', 'Vukovar', 'being', 'ripped', 'smithereens', 'Newsweek', 'journalist', 'MIA', 'up', 'perfect', 'pretext', 'New', 'Yorker', 'wife', 'played', 'suitably', 'melancholy', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'also', 'journalist', 'made', 'wonder', 'ten', 'bedroom', 'house', 'take', 'flying', 'trip', 'thick', 'macabre', 'sat', 'tight', 'hoping', 'what', 'promised', 'be', 'gritty', 'love-during-war', 'film', 'Eastern', 'European', 'twist', 'really', 'was', 'was', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'award-winning', 'cameo', 'Pianist', 'two', 'years', 'afterward.My', 'problems', 'began', 'when', 'voice-overs', 'characters', 'sprung', 'up', 'middle', 'script', 'curious', 'narrative', 'technique', 'theme', 'nature', 'Just', 'when', 'were', 'moment', 'feeling', 'dumbstruck', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'came', 'someone', 'candid', 'camera', 'reminiscing', 'fact', 'Smacks', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'decision', 'made', 'post-production', 'failed', 'stunt', 'lend', 'realistic', 'tone', 'film', 'are', 'told', 'based', 'real', 'events', '.As', 'War-is-Evil', 'statement', 'extent', 'depicting', 'heinous', 'atrocities', 'war', 'supported', 'amply', 'brilliant', 'score', 'left', 'more', 'appreciation', 'ethnic', 'belligerence', 'Balkans', 'had', 'film', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'Man', 'Land', 'have', 'stricken', 'lot', 'more', 'strident', 'note', 'regard.While', 'motley', 'crew', 'reporters', 'meandered', 'cavernous', 'cities', 'romantic', 'undercurrent', 'held', 'interest', 'parts', 'unravelled', 'much', 'too', 'slowly', 'leaving', 'enough', 'time', 'key', 'melodrama', 'unfold', 'sloppy', 'finale', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Harrison', 'title', 'found', 'brought', 'back', 'warmth', 'humongous', 'family', 'house', 'remnant', 'trauma', 'resolved', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'Other', 'few', 'magical', 'flowers', 'rather', 'unclear', 'what', 'brought', 'about', 'turnaround.Much', 'three-star', 'appreciation', 'film', 'cinematographers', 'evoking', 'smoking', 'war', 'zone', 'very', 'difficult', 'shoots', 'nightmarish', 'countryside', '48', 'journalists', 'DVD', 'tells', 'were', 'killed', 'conflict', 'had', 'clear', 'purpose', 'leave', 'memory', 'war', 'posterity', 'purpose', 'commemorative', 'film', 'anyone', 'guess']",Harrison's Flowers

715961,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B00006HAX6,Wanda B. Red,"[1, 3]","Oddly this movie includes some of the best acting and some of the worst I've seen recently. Adrian Brody as a hard-nosed photographer in a theater of war is really compelling; meanwhile, Andie MacDowell, handsome as ever but no more talented, delivers every line in a disconcertingly wooden way.This disjunction somehow seems apropos of the film's gripping and (to my eye) realistic portrayal of the scene of war: gray, monotonous, punctuated by horrifying violence. In some of the shots inside the car, the dull rhythm of the windshield wipers scraping across the window of the grimy TV van attempting to nose its way further into the war zone becomes like the tell-tale heart. I about jumped out of my skin when they were shot at!The movie, in short, has some astonishingly good moments, especially in the war scenes. The male actors are really impressive, though David Strathairn is assigned more than even he can deliver when he must remain catatonic for over a year (I think there is a Shirley Temple movie with a similar hospital scene in which a bandaged war veteran groans ""Sarah, Sarah"" -- A Little Princess?). Sentimentalized tripe. At the same time, the film is unblinking in its unsentimentalized portrayal of war. Contradictions... contradictions.
