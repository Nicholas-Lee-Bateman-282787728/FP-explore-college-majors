Some of their 3D conversions like Beauty and the Beast have been stunning.  Others like The Little Mermaid left a lot to be desired.  I'm happy to say Cars not only surpasses expectations but in many ways sets the bar.  There were so many scenes where I found myself studying everything on screen as though I've never seen it before.  Radiator Springs gains impressive depth and the streets seem to go on forever in 3D.  Previously my go to film for 3D was Rio.  Cars just took that top spot.",5,"Have a friend that doesn't think 3D is cool, show them Cars 3D",1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,637,"['enjoyed', 'Cars', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'when', 'heard', 'coming', 'out', '3D', 'thought', 'was', 'cheap', 'ploy', 'Disney', 'get', 'extra', 'bucks', '3D', 'conversions', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'have', 'been', 'stunning', 'Others', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'Cars', 'not', 'only', 'expectations', 'many', 'ways', 'sets', 'bar', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'found', 'studying', 'everything', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'gains', 'impressive', 'depth', 'streets', 'seem', 'go', 'forever', '3D', 'Previously', 'go', 'film', '3D', 'was', 'Rio', 'Cars', 'just', 'took', 'top', 'spot']",N/A

You can't help but feel for the characters in this movie and casting Paul Newman as the Hudson Hornet was a stroke of genius.

1666417,AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B00E9ZATVW,JMM,"[6, 11]","I am a huge fan of all things Pixar - their stories are universal and the animation is beautiful. I have mixed feelings about ""Cars"" though, I find it to be one of Pixar's weakest films. Still, it's more fun than most other animated movies out there, so it's worth a watch if you've never seen it. Obviously, the movie was well-liked because its success has spawned both a sequel (""Cars 2"") and a spinoff (""Mater's Tall Tales""), as well as multiple short films.There's no doubt the ""Cars"" movies are very popular with kids. After all, what little boy hasn't spent hours playing with toy race cars? I know I spent a lot of time playing with cars, and this movie channels that excitement that I felt playing as a kid. A lot of kids also find Mater (a comic relief character voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) to be appealing - in fact, I'd say that Mater has become one of the most well-known characters in any Pixar movie (except maybe Woody & Buzz).""Cars"" will soon be re-released in a 3D Ultimate Collector's Edition. The big question is: should you buy this 3D version or stick with the 2D version? Well, the first thing to know is that ""Cars"" was not originally intended to be 3D, so this will be a post-conversion job. But after watching the film, it is clear that there are plenty of opportunities for great 3D moments (and just about every scene will benefit from the added depth). Pixar has an excellent track record when it comes 3D quality, and ""Cars 2"" looked great in 3D. So there's no reason to think that ""Cars 3D"" will be anything less than spectacular.CARS 3D Blu-Ray - 3-Disc SetDISC 1: 3D Blu-Ray MovieDISC 2: Blu-Ray Movie + Special FeaturesDISC 3: DVD*Digital Copy redemption code is also included (no disc required)",4,Pixar's Cars - an entertaining film that kids will enjoy,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1731,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'things', 'Pixar', 'stories', 'are', 'universal', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Cars', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'Pixar', 'weakest', 'films', 'Still', 'more', 'fun', 'most', 'other', 'animated', 'movies', 'there', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'was', 'well-liked', 'success', 'spawned', 'sequel', '2', 'spinoff', 'Mater', 'Tall', 'Tales', 'as', 'well', 'multiple', 'short', 'films.There', 'doubt', 'Cars', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'popular', 'kids', 'what', 'little', 'boy', ""n't"", 'spent', 'hours', 'playing', 'toy', 'race', 'cars', 'know', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'playing', 'cars', 'movie', 'excitement', 'felt', 'playing', 'kid', 'lot', 'kids', 'also', 'find', 'Mater', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'voiced', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'be', 'appealing', 'fact', ""'d"", 'say', 'Mater', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'well-known', 'characters', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'maybe', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'Cars', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 're-released', '3D', 'Ultimate', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'big', 'question', 'should', 'buy', '3D', 'version', 'stick', '2D', 'version', 'Well', 'first', 'thing', 'know', 'Cars', 'was', 'not', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', '3D', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'post-conversion', 'job', 'watching', 'film', 'clear', 'are', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'great', '3D', 'moments', 'just', 'scene', 'will', 'benefit', 'added', 'depth', 'Pixar', 'excellent', 'track', 'record', 'when', '3D', 'quality', 'Cars', '2', 'looked', 'great', '3D', 'reason', 'think', 'Cars', '3D', 'will', 'be', 'anything', 'less', 'spectacular.CARS', '3D', 'Blu-Ray', '3-Disc', 'SetDISC', '1', '3D', 'Blu-Ray', 'MovieDISC', '2', 'Blu-Ray', 'Movie', '+', 'Special', 'FeaturesDISC', '3', 'DVD*Digital', 'Copy', 'redemption', 'code', 'also', 'included', 'disc', 'required']",N/A
