907811,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B0009KQOZQ,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[47, 53]","Lions Gate Films recently cut a deal with a Japanese company and created a small sub-division within LGF aptly named J-Horror. The purpose of this division was to make 6 Japanese horror flicks specifically for the American DVD market. 'Premonition' is one of the first of these films released(the second, released simultaneously, is called 'Infection' and is also very much worth checking out).The basic set-up goes like this:  a couple and their daughter are driving home from a vacation.  They stop along side the road at a telephone booth so the husband can attach his laptop to the phoneline so he could email some paperwork to his job.  While in the phone booth, he finds a newspaper clipping that predicts his daughter dying in a motor vehicle accident.  His wife exits the car to talk to him.  Once the wife is out of the car, the husband freaks out over the newspaper, but before he can do anyting a dumptruck smashes their car(with daughter still inside)and the newspaper disappears.  The car immediately explodes killing the little girl.  Not long after, the couple divorces mostly due to the wife not believing her husband's claims about the newspaper.  The husband starts receiving more newspapers predicting the future over the next six or so years and all the while the wife(now his ex)is doing research into the paranormal and the possible existence of this newspaper.  The couple gets back together to try and figure out the escalating events...'Premonition' is based on a thirty-or-so year old Japanese story called 'The Fear Newspaper'.  Apparently over there, its pretty well known .  Anyways, the acting is good and the special effects are very well done.  The plot, while having some similarites to 'Ringu'(especially the original novel by Koji Suzuki), is pretty interesting.  The ending, as Asian horror films tend to do, leave you feeling slightly confused.  'Premonition' though doesn't leave you hanging as badly as some others.  The extras on the disc are actually pretty good.  They're all subtitled, with the best feature being the one on visual effects.  Its very interesting.All in all, 'Premonition' is a nice little addition to any Asian horror fan's collection.  Its a nice, tense, well-acted little film.  While not completely original, its still a good flick.  There's not really any gore to speak of; this is pretty textbook J-horror.  If you dug 'Ringu' or 'Juon', I'm sure you will like 'Premonition'.",4,Fear Newspaper,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,2440,"['Lions', 'Gate', 'Films', 'recently', 'cut', 'deal', 'Japanese', 'company', 'created', 'small', 'sub-division', 'LGF', 'aptly', 'named', 'J-Horror', 'purpose', 'division', 'was', 'make', '6', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'flicks', 'specifically', 'American', 'DVD', 'market', ""'Premonition"", 'one', 'first', 'films', 'released', 'second', 'released', 'simultaneously', 'called', ""'Infection"", 'also', 'very', 'much', 'checking', 'out', '.The', 'basic', 'set-up', 'couple', 'daughter', 'are', 'driving', 'home', 'vacation', 'stop', 'road', 'telephone', 'husband', 'can', 'attach', 'laptop', 'phoneline', 'could', 'email', 'paperwork', 'job', 'phone', 'booth', 'newspaper', 'clipping', 'daughter', 'dying', 'motor', 'vehicle', 'accident', 'wife', 'car', 'talk', 'wife', 'car', 'husband', 'out', 'newspaper', 'can', 'do', 'anyting', 'dumptruck', 'car', 'daughter', 'still', 'inside', 'newspaper', 'car', 'immediately', 'killing', 'little', 'girl', 'Not', 'long', 'couple', 'mostly', 'due', 'wife', 'not', 'believing', 'husband', 'claims', 'newspaper', 'husband', 'receiving', 'more', 'newspapers', 'predicting', 'future', 'next', 'six', 'so', 'years', 'wife', 'now', 'ex', 'doing', 'research', 'paranormal', 'possible', 'existence', 'newspaper', 'couple', 'back', 'together', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'escalating', 'events', ""'Premonition"", 'based', 'thirty-or-so', 'year', 'old', 'Japanese', 'story', 'called', ""'The"", 'Fear', 'Newspaper', 'Apparently', 'there', 'pretty', 'well', 'known', 'Anyways', 'acting', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'plot', 'having', 'similarites', ""'Ringu"", 'especially', 'original', 'novel', 'Koji', 'Suzuki', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'ending', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'tend', 'do', 'leave', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'confused', ""'Premonition"", 'though', ""n't"", 'leave', 'hanging', 'as', 'badly', 'others', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', ""'re"", 'subtitled', 'best', 'feature', 'being', 'one', 'visual', 'effects', 'very', 'interesting.All', ""'Premonition"", 'nice', 'little', 'addition', 'Asian', 'horror', 'fan', 'collection', 'nice', 'tense', 'well-acted', 'little', 'film', 'not', 'completely', 'original', 'still', 'good', 'flick', 'not', 'really', 'gore', 'speak', 'pretty', 'textbook', 'J-horror', 'dug', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'like', ""'Premonition""]",Premonition j Horror Lic.

907814,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0009KQOZQ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[16, 21]","Premonition is the second entry in the J-Horror series, which are a special series of Japanese horror films made with a special eye toward American audiences. Each of the projected six movies is independent from its fellow J-Horror offerings - different stories, different directors, different everything. This is made quite obvious by the fact that Premonition is a completely different film from the first film entry, Infection. In all honesty, I was a little disappointed in this movie. Infection was fantastic, a tad confusing but full of gore. Premonition works on a psychological level, and one could argue that it's hardly a horror film at all. The ironic thing about this film is the fact that I'm sure it will play better to Japanese than American audiences. There would seem to be at least some root to the story in Japanese culture, and it's very sparing in terms of action sequences. Besides being pretty disjointed, the film (in my opinion) takes things too far in the final sequences. It leaps completely off the pages of logic and delivers a whole series of jarring twists that will make many Americans say ""Enough already!""The basic premise at play here is a ""Newspaper of Death"" that foretells the grim immediate future. It's never clear where this news actually comes from, but it is the curse of some individuals to be involuntary subscribers to it. This is the story of a teacher who finds a newspaper article foretelling his five-year-old daughter's death; at the time, he's inside a phone booth, and by the time he sees how and when the death is supposed to happen, it's too late. Then we fast forward three years. Now divorced, the main character sort of shuffles along through life trying to avoid newspapers, while his ex-wife is heavily involved in paranormal research. The two are drawn back together just as the man is pushed to the breaking point by a continuous supply of newspaper warnings - in fact, sometimes he just starts scribbling down soon-to-be tragic stories out of thin air. Torn by his indecision just prior to his daughter's death, he now faces the obvious question: should he act to prevent tragedies or simply ignore the premonitions he keeps receiving? Evidence suggests that either course of action will result in extreme unpleasantness. That decision is basically made for him, though, and this sets off a real whirlwind of an ending.If you liked Infection, that doesn't mean you'll like Premonition - or vice versa. These two films could not be more different. Premonition is more in the Ju-on tradition (with Ringu elements to it), but I would say it's significantly better than The Grudge. There are some effectively disturbing images here, but they are few in number, and that leads me to believe that casual horror fans will find Premonition a little less than exciting. There is no bad guy to center your feelings around, and this sort of amorphous source of horror plays better to those with an interest in the genre. There's also a sort of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu feel to the story; it just feels like you've seen elements of this film somewhere before, and that prevents Premonition from really delivering an effective blow that will stay with you a while. Premonition is a well-made, interesting horror movie - but it doesn't really leave a lasting impression.",4,And you thought your local paper was full of bad news,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,3316,"['Premonition', 'second', 'entry', 'J-Horror', 'series', 'are', 'special', 'series', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'made', 'special', 'eye', 'American', 'audiences', 'projected', 'six', 'movies', 'independent', 'fellow', 'J-Horror', 'offerings', 'different', 'stories', 'different', 'directors', 'different', 'everything', 'made', 'quite', 'obvious', 'fact', 'Premonition', 'completely', 'different', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'entry', 'Infection', 'honesty', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Infection', 'was', 'fantastic', 'tad', 'confusing', 'full', 'gore', 'Premonition', 'psychological', 'level', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'hardly', 'horror', 'film', 'ironic', 'thing', 'film', 'fact', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'play', 'better', 'Japanese', 'American', 'audiences', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'least', 'root', 'story', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'very', 'sparing', 'terms', 'action', 'sequences', 'being', 'pretty', 'disjointed', 'film', 'opinion', 'things', 'too', 'far', 'final', 'sequences', 'completely', 'pages', 'logic', 'whole', 'series', 'jarring', 'twists', 'will', 'make', 'many', 'Americans', 'say', 'Enough', 'already', 'basic', 'premise', 'play', 'here', 'Newspaper', 'Death', 'grim', 'immediate', 'future', 'never', 'clear', 'where', 'news', 'actually', 'curse', 'individuals', 'be', 'involuntary', 'subscribers', 'story', 'teacher', 'who', 'newspaper', 'article', 'foretelling', 'five-year-old', 'daughter', 'death', 'time', 'phone', 'booth', 'time', 'how', 'when', 'death', 'supposed', 'happen', 'too', 'late', 'Then', 'fast', 'forward', 'three', 'years', 'Now', 'divorced', 'main', 'character', 'sort', 'shuffles', 'life', 'trying', 'avoid', 'newspapers', 'ex-wife', 'heavily', 'involved', 'paranormal', 'research', 'two', 'are', 'drawn', 'back', 'together', 'just', 'man', 'pushed', 'breaking', 'point', 'continuous', 'supply', 'newspaper', 'warnings', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'just', 'scribbling', 'down', 'soon-to-be', 'tragic', 'stories', 'thin', 'air', 'Torn', 'indecision', 'just', 'prior', 'daughter', 'death', 'now', 'obvious', 'question', 'should', 'act', 'prevent', 'tragedies', 'simply', 'ignore', 'premonitions', 'receiving', 'Evidence', 'course', 'action', 'will', 'result', 'extreme', 'unpleasantness', 'decision', 'basically', 'made', 'though', 'off', 'real', 'whirlwind', 'ending.If', 'liked', 'Infection', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Premonition', 'vice', 'versa', 'two', 'films', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Premonition', 'more', 'Ju-on', 'tradition', 'Ringu', 'elements', 'would', 'say', 'significantly', 'better', 'Grudge', 'are', 'effectively', 'disturbing', 'images', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'number', 'believe', 'casual', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'Premonition', 'little', 'less', 'exciting', 'bad', 'guy', 'center', 'feelings', 'sort', 'amorphous', 'source', 'horror', 'plays', 'better', 'interest', 'genre', 'also', 'sort', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'feel', 'story', 'just', 'feels', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'elements', 'film', 'somewhere', 'before', 'prevents', 'Premonition', 'really', 'delivering', 'effective', 'blow', 'will', 'stay', 'while', 'Premonition', 'well-made', 'interesting', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression']",Premonition j Horror Lic.

It's never scary and it's never driven by fright.  I found it more of a mystery, a chiller at the very least.This is the story of a couple reeling from the death of their daughter, trying to find answers for it where none should exist.  Enter THE newspaper, a harbinger of bad news.  It pops up often, in varying states; more often than not, it's just a person who feels compelled to write a banner headline anywhere any time with ink if not blood.  These headlines have a knack of coming true.  Why?  That part of the story is kept a mystery.  There's never an explanation as to why these phantom newspapers appear and disappear with alarming regularity, and only to some people.I found this movie unendurably sad as it centers on the death of a child and the fracturing of a family.  Once you get past that, morbid curiosity takes over.  Why is this happening, how is it happening, can the future be changed, can the past be altered?  I thought it was an intriguing idea executed well.  I especially loved the riveting dissolve of reality towards the end.The actors were superb, the subtitles were easy to read (someone was smart enough to use yellow instead of white for easy readability), and the story was just clever enough to hold my interest throughout.I will add one observation, when a dress is stuck in a seatbelt; tear the dress.",4,The power of the press,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,1486,"['First', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'horror', 'film', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'major', 'components', 'required', 'designate', 'horror', 'film', 'never', 'scary', 'never', 'driven', 'fright', 'found', 'more', 'mystery', 'chiller', 'very', 'least.This', 'story', 'couple', 'reeling', 'death', 'daughter', 'trying', 'find', 'answers', 'where', 'none', 'should', 'exist', 'Enter', 'THE', 'newspaper', 'harbinger', 'bad', 'news', 'up', 'often', 'varying', 'states', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'just', 'person', 'who', 'compelled', 'write', 'banner', 'headline', 'anywhere', 'time', 'ink', 'not', 'blood', 'headlines', 'have', 'knack', 'coming', 'true', 'Why', 'part', 'story', 'kept', 'mystery', 'never', 'explanation', 'why', 'phantom', 'newspapers', 'appear', 'disappear', 'alarming', 'regularity', 'only', 'people.I', 'found', 'movie', 'unendurably', 'sad', 'death', 'child', 'fracturing', 'family', 'Once', 'get', 'past', 'morbid', 'curiosity', 'over', 'Why', 'happening', 'how', 'happening', 'can', 'future', 'be', 'changed', 'can', 'past', 'be', 'altered', 'thought', 'was', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'executed', 'well', 'especially', 'loved', 'riveting', 'dissolve', 'reality', 'end.The', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'subtitles', 'were', 'easy', 'read', 'someone', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'use', 'yellow', 'instead', 'white', 'easy', 'readability', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'clever', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'throughout.I', 'will', 'add', 'one', 'observation', 'when', 'dress', 'stuck', 'seatbelt', 'tear', 'dress']",Premonition j Horror Lic.
907817,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B0009KQOZQ,Ernest Jagger,"[5, 7]","I have always been one who believes that the nuances or suggestion of horror is more terrifying than the actual telling of horror itself. In the film ""Premonition"" (aka Yogen) director Norio Tsuruta has done just that. He has given the viewer a film which shows, not tells, the viewer just what horror really is: A nightmare in which the protagonist cannot fight the unforeseen forces of the spirit world. In this case, the foreknowledge of those who will die, and his inability to intercede. The film starts off innocently enough. We have a family that has just returned from a short outing to see the grandparents. On the drive home, however, things are about to become a bit sinister.Hideki Satomi (Hiroshi Mikami) is an up-and-coming promising and gifted professor. And on his journey home he is busy as ever trying to keep up with the work of his profession. Not wanting to fall behind in his work, he takes it with him. And although his wife Ayaka (Noriko Sakai) finds this annoying, she relents to his request to find a telephone booth along the side of the road, as his laptop computer needs a plug-in when the batteries begin to wane: But with the promise that he will leave his work behind afterwards and enjoy the trip home.Finding a telephone booth, Ayaka pulls over so Hideki can send his latest work to the university. While waiting for his computer to download the information, he notices a newspaper clipping at the base of the telephone. Opening it up, he is startled to find that the newspaper has a startling portrait and premonition: a foretelling of an ominous event. Shocked, and confused, a tragedy is about to occur. But this is just the beginning of a life of tragedy. There is to be more tragedy in store for him in the future. Hideki's life has intersected with the unknown forces of the spirit world. He has now been given the gift, or in this case, the curse of the foreknowledge of death.Furthermore, this family tragedy will not be the last. Hideki's life takes a tragic turn as he and his wife will eventually divorce. Blaming himself for not acting quickly enough to prevent an important tragedy in his life,  he shuts everyone out of his life. However, the newspapers never stop coming. He refuses to read them, and goes so far as to even having the windows of his apartment covered from seeing these 'Fear Newspapers' when they slap up against his windows. But he is about to take a different route, which will also alter his life. Knowing that these future events are about to occur, he ponders: Can they be prevented? And if so, will he be successful?This is where the film takes the suggestion and nuance of horror to a different height and gives the viewer a suspenseful film. Maybe he can alter the future? But at what cost? Is there a danger in interfering with the unforseen spirit world? And are there consequences for interfering? His former wife comes to see him; as she is now working for a paranormal research center, and she has come across some interesting and creepy information concerning these 'Fear Newspapers'It appears that Hideki is not the only one who knows of these newspaper premonitions. Ayaka has met a gifted pyschic who knows about these newspapers; but refuses to divulge any of this information to Ayaka, as those who do meet an unfortunate death: A death I might add that is very unpleasant. As Hideki and Ayaka journey on their quest to find out more about these newspaper premonitions, Hideki knows what he must do. And in doing so, he puts his life in jeopardy. I thought that ""Premonition"" was a wonderful film. They are the type of films that I wish were done more often.There are excellent special effects in this film, and the cinematography is outstanding. There is no gore in this film, but there are plenty of creepy and suspensful twists that make ""Premonition"" one of the better horror films in the genre. I know many people who do not appreciate this film, however, I believe the film works on many levels and I highly recommend it for those who wish to add it to their horror collection. This film is creepy in the way it handles the nuances of horror and terror. I highly recommend you purchase the film.

907821,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0009KQOZQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 15]","To be upfront, I'm not a huge fan of Americanized remakes of Japanese ghost stories or supernatural thrillers. You can keep ""The Ring,"" ""Dark Water,"" ""Pulse"" and ""The Grudge""--to me, it's just hokum with little reason or rationale. You could make a shot-for-shot remake, and I'd still prefer the original. Why? I don't know, maybe it's just a bias. The Japanese ghost story has such a long history in film, maybe I've become accustomed to it--I'm seeing an evolution of the genre and it seems more natural. That doesn't mean that the plots make any more sense, but the films are generally better at evoking a mood and a sense of dread. Having recently seen two such entries in the Japanese horror lexicon, ""Premonition"" and ""Infection,"" I was once again caught up in creepy goings-on and otherworldly intrigues. Both films are entertaining, if somewhat problematic, and will likely be enjoyed by those who appreciate this sort of thing.From a technical standpoint, ""Premonition"" is probably the stronger of the two films. When a family on vacation stops to use a pay phone, the father stumbles on a newspaper portending the death of his daughter. Within a minute, this happens in a harrowing and well executed sequence. Some years later, the couple has separated and both are still haunted by the incident. The husband, in particular, has not recovered from the strange newspaper--no one has believed in its existence. The wife, working in the field of mental phenomena, starts to realize that perhaps her husband isn't delusional--just as he starts to be alerted with further premonitions. United, they try to piece together the history of the newspaper and some of the people who have encountered similar visions. The film evolves into a treatise on sacrifice, mental illness, and whether you can change destiny.""Infection,"" on the other hand, is set in a dilapidated and understaffed hospital. A crew of incompetent personnel face inexperience and lack of supplies that cause a neglect of patient care. After the accidental death of a patient and a cover-up of its particulars, they must then face a patient who is literally dissolving with an unknown infection. Needless to say, the infection soon starts to spread--and the staff ends up battling for survival. This is a fun, if not very believable, setup and the resultant film is notable for its hysterics as well as its horror. After a bit of a lark, though, the film tries for a double-twist ending and a meaningful conclusion.Ultimately, I enjoyed both films. ""Premonition"" boasts great lead performances, develops a believable chemistry between its stars, and follows through with an interesting ethical dilemma. ""Infection"" is loopier, more cheesy fun. A lot of people were put off by how unrealistic the hospital setting was--but I actually think this enhances the film. Neither film has a gore or real fright content, they are more about unseen and uncontrollable powers. And while ""Premonition"" flows to a somewhat logical conclusion, ""Infection"" seems not to know when to end. It has two different logical conclusions, but passes both of them up for one that is less effective--in my opinion. Anyway, you know if you like this sort of thing or not--either or both are worth checking out. ""Premonition"" is about 4 stars, while ""Infection"" is at 3 1/2 (although I found most of it crazy and fun!)

907824,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009KQOZQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","""Kansen"" (""Infection"") was the first title in the J-Horror Theater project put together by producer Taka Inchise. With the international success of ""Ringu"" and ""Ju-On"" the idea is to keep Japan at the forefront of making horror films with a six-part film anthology. Involved in the project are Hideo Nakata (""Ringu""), Kiyoshi Kurosawa (""Kairo""), and Takashi Shimizu (""Ju-On"").  ""Yogen"" (""Premonitin"") is the second film in the series (""J horaa shiataa 2""), directed by Norio Tsuruta, and strongly suggests that these Japanese filmmakers will succeed in the horror genre where their American counterparts have so miserably failed in churning out all those mindless splatter flicks.  If two dots define a line, then ""Kansen"" and ""Yogen"" prove that you can solid little horror films without resorting to the cultural mysticism of the big vengeful ghost Japanese horror films.  The goal of this series is not to shock you, but to make you party to the pain and suffering of the characters.The Satomi family consists of dad, Hideki (Hiroshi Mikami), his wife Ayaka (Noriko Sakai) and their five-year-old daughter Nana (Hana Inoue).  Mom is driving the car back to Tokyo and dad is in the backseat working on his computer while the kid is locked into her child seat.  They stop at a roadside phone booth so that Hideki can use the convenient computer connection to send an important e-mail.  While he is waiting he spots an old newspaper clipping and picks it up.  The newspaper seems to snap at him malevolently, and then he notices with horror that it says his daughter was killed in an automobile accident.  On the other side of the road, Ayaka cannot get Nana out of the car seat.  Suffice it to say, what the newspaper article says will happen does indeed happen, right before the horrified eyes of Hideki and the audience.  In the aftermath of the tragedy he keeps trying to find the newspaper that foretold what happened.  Of course, he does not find it.Three years later Hideki and his wife are divorced.  He avoids newspaper while she does research into psychic phenomena.  Apparently she is trying to confirm her husband's story, although to what end we are not sure.  There are indeed other newspaper headlines, and more horrible things happen, and Hideki tries to do something about them.  Through these efforts he learns that those who see these headlines can stop them from coming to pass, but only at a terrible price.  This is clear in the tradition of classical mythology where attempting to thwart a prophecy is the worst thing you can do (best proved in ""Oedipus the King,"" where the original prophecy that the son will kill the father is added to when Jocasta tries to murder her own son).  I anticipated that this was leading to some ultimate horror to be avoided, as in ""The Dead Zone"" or ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" but ""Yogen"" comes for something more intimate and ultimately more satisfying.This 2004 horror film has a terrific hook at the start, although it does essentially punch the audience right in the gut, but the problem comes with the lengthy line before we get to the weighty sinker at the end.  The first and second acts of the film suffer in comparison to the opening, as we slowly get a sense for what the rules are here.  There will be many viewers who will start to nod out as this point, because not only is it not all that clear how the plot is developing at this point, it is also all unfolding in a rather low-key manner that can lull you into having your attention wander from reading the sub-titles.  However, the final act is solid, and even if the final resolution becomes clear to you a bit sooner than it does to the main character, that does not make it that much less satisfying.  So, no matter what, stick around for the ending so you can take the payoff into rendering your final verdict.  Well worth watching, but I think you could recut it to something under an hour and make it a lot more effective.",4,"There are worse things than knowing the future, namely trying to change it",1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,3948,"['Kansen', 'Infection', 'was', 'first', 'title', 'J-Horror', 'Theater', 'project', 'put', 'together', 'producer', 'Taka', 'Inchise', 'international', 'success', 'Ringu', 'Ju-On', 'idea', 'keep', 'Japan', 'forefront', 'making', 'horror', 'films', 'six-part', 'film', 'anthology', 'Involved', 'project', 'are', 'Hideo', 'Nakata', 'Ringu', 'Kiyoshi', 'Kurosawa', 'Kairo', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'Ju-On', 'Yogen', 'Premonitin', 'second', 'film', 'series', 'J', 'horaa', 'shiataa', '2', 'directed', 'Norio', 'Tsuruta', 'strongly', 'Japanese', 'filmmakers', 'will', 'succeed', 'horror', 'genre', 'where', 'American', 'counterparts', 'have', 'so', 'miserably', 'failed', 'churning', 'out', 'mindless', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'two', 'dots', 'define', 'line', 'then', 'Kansen', 'Yogen', 'prove', 'can', 'solid', 'little', 'horror', 'films', 'resorting', 'cultural', 'mysticism', 'big', 'vengeful', 'ghost', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'goal', 'series', 'not', 'shock', 'make', 'party', 'pain', 'suffering', 'characters.The', 'Satomi', 'family', 'dad', 'Hideki', 'Hiroshi', 'Mikami', 'wife', 'Ayaka', 'Noriko', 'Sakai', 'five-year-old', 'daughter', 'Nana', 'Hana', 'Inoue', 'Mom', 'driving', 'car', 'back', 'Tokyo', 'dad', 'backseat', 'working', 'computer', 'kid', 'locked', 'child', 'seat', 'stop', 'roadside', 'phone', 'Hideki', 'can', 'use', 'convenient', 'computer', 'connection', 'send', 'important', 'e-mail', 'waiting', 'spots', 'old', 'newspaper', 'clipping', 'picks', 'up', 'newspaper', 'snap', 'malevolently', 'then', 'horror', 'daughter', 'was', 'killed', 'automobile', 'accident', 'other', 'side', 'road', 'Ayaka', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'Nana', 'car', 'seat', 'Suffice', 'say', 'what', 'newspaper', 'article', 'will', 'happen', 'indeed', 'happen', 'right', 'horrified', 'eyes', 'Hideki', 'audience', 'aftermath', 'tragedy', 'trying', 'find', 'newspaper', 'foretold', 'what', 'happened', 'course', 'not', 'find', 'it.Three', 'years', 'later', 'Hideki', 'wife', 'are', 'divorced', 'newspaper', 'research', 'psychic', 'phenomena', 'Apparently', 'trying', 'confirm', 'husband', 'story', 'what', 'end', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'indeed', 'other', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'more', 'horrible', 'things', 'happen', 'Hideki', 'tries', 'do', 'something', 'efforts', 'who', 'see', 'headlines', 'can', 'stop', 'coming', 'pass', 'only', 'terrible', 'price', 'clear', 'tradition', 'classical', 'mythology', 'where', 'attempting', 'thwart', 'prophecy', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'best', 'proved', 'Oedipus', 'King', 'where', 'original', 'prophecy', 'son', 'will', 'kill', 'father', 'added', 'when', 'Jocasta', 'murder', 'own', 'son', 'anticipated', 'was', 'leading', 'ultimate', 'horror', 'be', 'avoided', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'Yogen', 'something', 'more', 'intimate', 'ultimately', 'more', 'satisfying.This', '2004', 'horror', 'film', 'terrific', 'hook', 'start', 'essentially', 'punch', 'audience', 'right', 'gut', 'problem', 'lengthy', 'line', 'get', 'weighty', 'sinker', 'end', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'film', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'opening', 'slowly', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'rules', 'are', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'start', 'nod', 'out', 'point', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'plot', 'developing', 'point', 'also', 'unfolding', 'rather', 'low-key', 'manner', 'can', 'lull', 'having', 'attention', 'wander', 'reading', 'sub-titles', 'However', 'final', 'act', 'solid', 'even', 'final', 'resolution', 'clear', 'bit', 'sooner', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'less', 'satisfying', 'So', 'matter', 'what', 'stick', 'around', 'ending', 'can', 'take', 'payoff', 'rendering', 'final', 'verdict', 'Well', 'watching', 'think', 'could', 'recut', 'something', 'hour', 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'effective']",Premonition j Horror Lic.

The director tries to keep you guessing by not showing what's occurring but hinting at it so your wondering what the people in the film see. Then they show you to add the shock value.

907830,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0009KQOZQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Premonition (Norio Tsuruta, 2004)No, this is not the Sandra Bullock movie from 2007, this is a minor supernatural thriller from Japan that was released three years previously. Which already makes it better than the Sandra Bullock movie, which only narrowly missed Rotten Tomatoes' 100 worst of the decade list (Tomatometer rating: 8%). No, this Premonition is one part Donnie Darko, one part Final Destination, one part live-action anime (the screenplay is adapted from a Jiro Tsunoda manga), one part Norio Tsuruta (Ring 0: Birthday), and one part the complete kickassness of Daisuke Ban, a Tsuruta regular whom most American fans of Japanese horror will recognize from all four Japanese Ring films (yes, including Spiral, which makes Ban the only cast member to appear in all four Ring films made in Japan). Unfortunately, Ban's role here is a small one, but that does nothing to distract from the movie itself.Hideki Satomi (Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters' Hiroshi Mikami) and his family, wife Ayaka (Moonlight Jellyfish's Noriko Sakai) and daughter Nana (Hana Inoue in her film debut), are on their way back into town from a visit to the in-laws. They pull over at a rest stop so Hideki can hook his laptop up and transmit some data to work when he sees a newspaper clipping that foretells the death of his daughter, seconds later. Sure enough, a dump truck smashes into the car, Nana's seatbelt is jammed, and a fiery explosion occurs. From here, the movie splits into two plots. First, Hideki starts finding more of these newspaper clippings foretelling the deaths of others around him, which enables him to go into superhero mode, stopping those he loves from getting into nasty situations. Second, he has to try and find a way to use this newfound power to try and change things so that his daughter survives. (I should have added ""one part The Butterfly Effect"", I guess.)I stress that this is not a bad little movie in any way; it's well-acted, well-shot (the whole thing has a gloomy, gritty feel to it that works very well), and the guys who did the manga adaptation put a lot of thought into pace and mise-en-scene that one doesn't normally get from horror-manga adaptations (think Uzumaki here, or any of the films from Hideshi Hino's Horror Theatre). And yet nothing here is original; in fact, while I can't say most of it is directly lifted from the films I named above (I don't know how recent the manga is), it's obvious that Tsuruta has seen them all, and they have informed the way he approaches the material. Again, this is not something I have a problem with, and I don't think most horror fans will; if it's not a fresh take on the genre, it's at least a competent one. While normally I'd recommend a movie like this for only the diehard horror fan, I can see this one going the other way; just like Final Destination roped a lot of non-horror-fans into the genre ten years ago, Premonition could have that same kind of effect, given the proper marketing push in America (where it is finally available). ***",3,"Fun, though not original.",1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,3032,"['Premonition', 'Norio', 'Tsuruta', '2004', 'No', 'not', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'movie', '2007', 'minor', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'Japan', 'was', 'released', 'three', 'years', 'previously', 'Which', 'already', 'better', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'movie', 'only', 'narrowly', 'missed', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', '100', 'worst', 'decade', 'list', 'Tomatometer', 'rating', '8', '%', 'No', 'Premonition', 'one', 'part', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'one', 'part', 'Final', 'Destination', 'one', 'part', 'live-action', 'anime', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'Jiro', 'Tsunoda', 'manga', 'one', 'part', 'Norio', 'Tsuruta', 'Ring', '0', 'Birthday', 'one', 'part', 'complete', 'kickassness', 'Daisuke', 'Ban', 'Tsuruta', 'regular', 'whom', 'most', 'American', 'fans', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'will', 'recognize', 'four', 'Japanese', 'Ring', 'films', 'yes', 'including', 'Spiral', 'Ban', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'appear', 'four', 'Ring', 'films', 'made', 'Japan', 'Unfortunately', 'Ban', 'role', 'here', 'small', 'one', 'nothing', 'distract', 'movie', 'itself.Hideki', 'Satomi', 'Mishima', 'Life', 'Four', 'Chapters', 'Hiroshi', 'Mikami', 'family', 'wife', 'Ayaka', 'Moonlight', 'Jellyfish', 'Noriko', 'Sakai', 'daughter', 'Nana', 'Hana', 'Inoue', 'film', 'debut', 'are', 'way', 'back', 'town', 'visit', 'in-laws', 'pull', 'over', 'rest', 'stop', 'Hideki', 'can', 'hook', 'laptop', 'up', 'transmit', 'data', 'work', 'when', 'newspaper', 'clipping', 'death', 'daughter', 'later', 'Sure', 'enough', 'dump', 'truck', 'smashes', 'car', 'Nana', 'seatbelt', 'jammed', 'fiery', 'explosion', 'occurs', 'here', 'movie', 'two', 'plots', 'First', 'Hideki', 'finding', 'more', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'foretelling', 'deaths', 'others', 'go', 'superhero', 'mode', 'stopping', 'getting', 'nasty', 'situations', 'Second', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'use', 'newfound', 'power', 'try', 'change', 'things', 'so', 'daughter', 'survives', 'should', 'have', 'added', 'one', 'part', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'guess', 'stress', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'movie', 'way', 'well-acted', 'well-shot', 'whole', 'thing', 'gloomy', 'gritty', 'feel', 'very', 'well', 'guys', 'who', 'did', 'manga', 'adaptation', 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'pace', 'mise-en-scene', 'one', ""n't"", 'normally', 'get', 'horror-manga', 'adaptations', 'think', 'Uzumaki', 'here', 'films', 'Hideshi', 'Hino', 'Horror', 'Theatre', 'yet', 'nothing', 'here', 'original', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'most', 'directly', 'lifted', 'films', 'named', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'recent', 'manga', 'obvious', 'Tsuruta', 'seen', 'have', 'informed', 'way', 'material', 'Again', 'not', 'something', 'have', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'fresh', 'take', 'genre', 'least', 'competent', 'one', 'normally', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'only', 'diehard', 'horror', 'fan', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'going', 'other', 'way', 'just', 'Final', 'Destination', 'roped', 'lot', 'non-horror-fans', 'genre', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Premonition', 'could', 'have', 'same', 'kind', 'effect', 'given', 'proper', 'marketing', 'push', 'America', 'where', 'finally', 'available', '***']",Premonition j Horror Lic.

907832,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0009KQOZQ,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","We learn from the DVD extras from an interview with the Director, that ""Premonition"" is based on a 30 year old Japanese horror novel titled ""Fear Newspaper"". The plot involves people who are sent newspapers from unseen forces that foretell the calamitous events or murders in the near future. Premonition reminds me of the 1944 American film ""It happened tomorrow"" where a man receives a copy of tomorrow's newspaper which predicts his own demise.In this Japanese version, the protagonist is Hideki Satomi. He's a high school teacher obsessed with his work so when traveling on a vacation with his wife, Ayaka, and 5 year old daughter, Nana, the power fails on his notebook computer and he insists that his wife turn their car around and backtrack to a pay phone a few miles away where he can plug the computer into a power source and recharge the battery. As he's waiting for the battery to recharge inside the phone booth, his wife is having trouble extricating Nana from the car as the little girl's dress has gotten stuck inside the seat belt. Meanwhile, Hideki is dumbfounded when a burnt up piece of newspaper comes floating from the sky and rests in front of him inside the phone booth. The newspaper has a picture of his daughter with a caption announcing her death in a horrible accident. Seconds later, as Ayaka leaves the car and goes across the road to get Hideki to help her get Nana out of the car, a truck plows into the car, causing it to catch fire, explode and kill the hapless little girl.Flash forward three years later. Hideki and Ayaka are no longer together (we later learn that Ayaka no longer wanted to hear about the mysterious newspaper that Hideki kept harping upon). Ironically, when the 'fear newspaper' (otherwise referred to as 'newspaper of terror') suddenly starts popping up in Hideki's life again predicting ghastly events, Hideki wants nothing to do with 'newspapers' and is oblivious to their clues; but Ayaka is now a researcher of psychic phenomena at the local university and is intent on getting to the bottom of what might have happened with the 'fear newspaper'.Ayaka is working with an older woman, a psychic who uses her power to produce images on Polaroid (instant) film. The psychic tells Ayaka of a researcher, Rei Kigata, who has disappeared but prior to his disappearance discovered there is a place in the cosmos where all thoughts and memories coalesce. Certain people (like Hideki) become privy to incidents in the future through the fear newspaper which appear (as previously stated), out of nowhere. This is perhaps the weakest aspect of Premonition's story. Unlike the aforementioned ""It happened tomorrow"", where an old man delivers the newspaper, and there is some kind of relationship between the old man and the protagonist, the 'fear newspaper' arrives as a result from an unseen, vaguely defined force in the cosmos. It would have been much more compelling if there was some kind of devil-like figure that was delivering the newspaper instead of the random delivery which simply wasn't suspenseful.Ayaka soon finds the psychic dead in her research laboratory. Meanwhile, Hideki is powerless to stop the murder of one of his teenage students despite receiving prior notification that the ghastly event will occur. Hideki continues to receive warnings of catastrophic events (such as a landslide) through the fear newspaper and again he's unable to do anything. We're even past the midpoint in the film and the central question is not asked--what can Hideki do to reverse the events that led to the death of daughter? Finally, Ayaka's research assistant finds the address of the mysterious Rei Kigata and Ayaka and Hideki go to visit him. However, when they arrive the house is deserted. By watching various old videotapes (some 12 years old), they see that Kigata attempted to alter the future interfering in the very events that are predicted to come true. We can see that Kigata begins developing plague-like symptoms on his body as a result of his meddling with the future.Finally Hideki realizes that he can change fate but at a cost. Three quarters of the film is already over and finally a suspenseful event occurs. Hideki (after receiving another newspaper) prevents his wife from getting on a commuter train before it crashes and kills most everyone on board. However, Ayaka's research assistant was with her in the train and Hideki doesn't realize it when he pulls his ex-wife off onto the platform right before the train leaves the station.Now Hideki finds himself caught in some kind of vortex where he's going backward in time. Before he knows it, he's back at the scene where his daughter was killed. He tries to interfere, saves the daughter but this time the wife is killed. Then he finds himself inside the cab of the truck with the truck driver who's had the seizure; again he can't stop the truck from plowing into his car. Finally, he remembers what the psychic had told him: you can change your own fate. This time 'he gets it'. He's able to save his daughter but must sacrifice his own life to save the little girl.There's a ton of great material on the DVD extras including numerous scenes that show us how Premonition was made. I was impressed with the degree of cooperation between the director and the rest of the cast and crew. Nonetheless, director Norio Tsuruta resorts to introducing too many horror clich&eacute;s (e.g. the drooling serial killer) at the expense of a tight and suspenseful plot. Without a clearly defined antagonist and the failure of the protagonist to be proactive throughout most of the film, Premonition fails to accomplish its goals: consistently scare its audience and keep it in a state of suspense.",2,Japanese fantasy horror flick lacks suspense,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,5715,"['learn', 'DVD', 'extras', 'interview', 'Director', 'Premonition', 'based', '30', 'year',

Before this film does officially get massacred by Hollywood, (it has been marked for remake hell) I thought it may be the best time to review this piece of Japanese horror. J-Horror theater 2: PREMONITION (aka. YOGEN, 2004) is based on the manga by Jiro Tsunoda called ""Kyofu Shimbun"" (Newspaper of Terror). Directed by Norio Tsurata, the film does have a somewhat nostalgic feel to it, similar to the 60's TV show ""Twilight Zone""; which wouldn't be surprising since the Japanese comic became popular in the 1970's.Newspapers are used to tell the past, but for a few unlucky individuals, they foretell the future. When Hideki (Hiroshi Mikami) picked up a piece of a newspaper that foretells his daughter`s death, he is so puzzled as to what this piece of paper meant and before he realizes what is happening, he is too late to save her.After the accident, Hideki and his wife Ayaka (beauteous Noriko Sakai, Ju-On 2), divorced and they go their separate ways. Three years have passed, Ayaka had been researching this strange phenomena with the aid of a medium, Prof. Mikoshiba (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) while Hideki fears that if he picks up a newspaper, he will see death. Nonetheless, Hideki begins foretelling ill-omened fate of murder to train crashes, there is nothing Hideki can do to stop the events...or is there? Now, Hideki and Ayaka must find others who have experienced this mysterious phenomenon, in hope of finding an answer. Little do they know that they will be changing their lives forever....The film does have a good plot and even references the famous psychic Chizuko Mifune, the medium who was discovered by a spiritualistic professor and who later committed suicide. The direction by Norio Tsurata is quite competent but somehow I think his style does push the film a bit to human drama than towards chilling horror. Tsurata does steer the film towards a melodramatic approach and while I appreciate that he took the time to flesh out his characters, some viewers may take it as a way to divert the film from its horrific premise. Still, the film does have a number of intense scenes that are both chilling and unnerving. The film does take its time, which helps its script as it builds credibility through its screenplay.The film's cinematography is polished and stylized. Although some of the CGI effects does look a little cheesy at times. Despite its faults, the ominous music and the nicely paced sequences do assist the film in entertaining me. I am a bit put off by Hiroshi Mikami's performance, he was trying a bit too hard to act terrified. Fortunately, Noriko Sakai is around to bail him out. Sakai is a great actress and quite a treat to look at.Now about the plot. The film focuses more on the phenomena's investigation rather than scenes after scenes of deaths and accidents. Most of the violence happen off camera, Hideki and Ayaka does take center stage. While the couple obsesses in finding the secret of the ""Fear Newspaper"", they slowly find themselves becoming attached to each other again. The secret of Rei Kigat and the 13-year old boy who aged into an old man within 6 months are the film's major selling points. These scenes are very unnerving as they become revealed as I got closer to the film's climax.The good thing about ""Yogen"" is that the film does have a solid plot and the rules of the film does have a lot of credibility and answers its own questions. True, the film's script does contain some of the usual histrionics, but I do think ""Premonition"" is a very good film. The film is nicely paced and pleasingly well-rounded. It contained quite a few surprises and avoids cheap scares. No, there is no long-haired ghost in pale make-up on this one. The film focuses on its characters, its mystery and it's logic does make a whole lot of sense when you put it all together. Rei Kigat and Hideki's fates are quite credible, but it also opens some questions.This is the type of film that the less you know about it, the better the experience will be. Tsurata is to be commended that he managed to generate a feeling of intrigue and genuine creepiness in the film. The film's internal logic and unusual surprises managed to keep me interested for its entirety, despite Mikami's overdone performance. Noriko Sakai is real nice to look at.Whenever you touch a newspaper, do you notice the ink getting on your fingers? You won't look at it the same way again.Highly Recommended!

907836,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B0009KQOZQ,Zack Davisson,"[0, 0]","Does a horror film have to be scary to be good?  Can it simply be unnerving, taking you out of the normal order of things and into a stranger world, and still be called a horror film?  Because that is exactly what Premonition does.  There is nothing really scary here, and aside from a few brief scenes no jumps or creeps, nothing to upset your sleep. But it is undeniably a horror film and a very good one at that.The second release in the ""J-Horror Theater"" series, followingInfectionand followed byReincarnation, Premonition (""Yogen"") is an atmospheric and suspenseful film with a supernatural flair typical of the anthology horror series.  Adapted from a manga called ""Kyofu Shimbun"" (""Terror Newspaper""), it tells the story of a family haunted by a foretelling-newspaper, one which only shows a future of death.  A couple witnesses the death of their young daughter in an automobile accident, one which was foretold only moments before by a strange newspaper.  Devastated by the event, the father becomes a shell of a man, giving up on his profession and life in general and just going through the motions.  The mother, more driven, experiments with psychics in order to try and uncover the truth behind the mystery.  Slowly, the father begins to predict future deaths every time he writes something down, and encounters others who have had their future shown to them by the cursed newspaper.Director Tsuruta Norio is one of the Japanese ""Masters of Horror"", directingRing 0and several episodes of theScary True Storiesseries.  Much of the style he brings to Premonition is typical of Japanese horror, including the atmospheric, family-centered stories such as seen inDark Waterand the originalRing.  Keeping the story tight, focusing on the estranged couple and how they deal with the death of their child, gives the film an emotional depth that wouldn't be found if he went for the screams.  Actor Mikami Hiroshi (who I last saw inMerry Christmas Mr. Lawrence) does a great job as the shattered father, and Sakai Noriko (Ju-On 2) is perfect as the beautiful wife and mother who pushes the story forward.  Special notice also goes to Inoue Hana, whose brief screen time as the couples doomed daughter Nana really digs into the heart.I cannot say that there is anything overwhelming original here, nothing that makes the film stand out, but it is just genre down exceedingly well.  This is not a yurei flick, so don't expect to see the famous white-faced girl making an appearance, but the Japanese horror genre is not so one-note as people sometimes think.  Premonition uses everything that is good about the style, without cliches or unnecessary pandering, and delivers an honest and compelling story.On an additional note: The Sandra Bullock filmPremonitionis not a re-make of this movie, although they have identical titles.",4,Sometimes it's better to do nothing,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,2833,"['horror', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'scary', 'be', 'good', 'Can', 'simply', 'be', 'unnerving', 'taking', 'normal', 'order', 'things', 'stranger', 'world', 'still', 'be', 'called', 'horror', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'Premonition', 'nothing', 'really', 'scary', 'here', 'aside', 'few', 'brief', 'jumps', 'creeps', 'nothing', 'upset', 'sleep', 'undeniably', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'that.The', 'second', 'release', 'J-Horror', 'Theater', 'series', 'followingInfectionand', 'followed', 'byReincarnation', 'Premonition', 'Yogen', 'atmospheric', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'supernatural', 'flair', 'typical', 'anthology', 'horror', 'series', 'Adapted', 'manga', 'called', 'Kyofu', 'Shimbun', 'Terror', 'Newspaper', 'story', 'family', 'haunted', 'foretelling-newspaper', 'one', 'only', 'future', 'death', 'couple', 'death', 'young', 'daughter', 'automobile', 'accident', 'one', 'was', 'foretold', 'only', 'moments', 'strange', 'newspaper', 'Devastated', 'event', 'father', 'shell', 'man', 'giving', 'up', 'profession', 'life', 'general', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'mother', 'more', 'driven', 'experiments', 'psychics', 'order', 'try', 'uncover', 'truth', 'mystery', 'Slowly', 'father', 'predict', 'future', 'deaths', 'time', 'something', 'down', 'encounters', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'future', 'shown', 'cursed', 'newspaper.Director', 'Tsuruta', 'Norio', 'one', 'Japanese', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'directingRing', '0and', 'several', 'episodes', 'theScary', 'True', 'Storiesseries', 'Much', 'style', 'Premonition', 'typical', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'including', 'atmospheric', 'family-centered', 'stories', 'such', 'seen', 'inDark', 'Waterand', 'originalRing', 'Keeping', 'story', 'tight', 'focusing', 'estranged', 'couple', 'how', 'deal', 'death', 'child', 'film', 'emotional', 'depth', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'went', 'screams', 'Actor', 'Mikami', 'Hiroshi', 'who', 'last', 'saw', 'inMerry', 'Christmas', 'Mr.', 'Lawrence', 'great', 'job', 'shattered', 'father', 'Sakai', 'Noriko', 'Ju-On', '2', 'perfect', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'story', 'forward', 'Special', 'notice', 'also', 'Inoue', 'Hana', 'brief', 'screen', 'time', 'couples', 'doomed', 'daughter', 'Nana', 'really', 'heart.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'overwhelming', 'original', 'here', 'nothing', 'film', 'stand', 'just', 'genre', 'down', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'not', 'yurei', 'flick', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'famous', 'white-faced', 'girl', 'making', 'appearance', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'genre', 'not', 'so', 'one-note', 'people', 'sometimes', 'think', 'Premonition', 'everything', 'good', 'style', 'cliches', 'unnecessary', 'pandering', 'delivers', 'honest', 'compelling', 'story.On', 'additional', 'note', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'filmPremonitionis', 'not', 're-make', 'movie', 'have', 'identical', 'titles']",Premonition j Horror Lic.
