If your child is too frightened to watch the carebears, then it becomes more an issue of you smothering your child. If you think that it is too scary, and you want to keep your child from being exposed to the scary noheart, then you are going to have a lot to handle when your kid is at a sleepover when she is 8 and witnesses the nightmare on elmstreet or something for the first time. Sometimes its ok to be scared, and if you shelter them from it then you are gonna end up with a kid with major psychological issues. Carebears is  good starter for a kid. Noheart may do ""bad things"" to the carebears, but people do a lot worse things to other people in the real world, sheltering them from a diluted version of that fact is only going to make it worse when they face the real version.

Even though I hadn't been born yet when these episodes were originally aired, I watched the reruns as a young child and not once did I consider No Heart to be a scary villian. And his henchmen Beastly and Shrieky were far from terrfying. In fact, they were the center of many hilarious incidents that had me laughing until my sides hurt. My sister who is three years younger than I am, watched them with me and she was never negatively affected by it and only remembers how much she loved it. This show features loveable characters, exciting adventures, and heart-warming tales of friendship. I highly recommend this show and I hope to one day watch it with my children.And for the people who claim that this show isn't the ""original"" you are correct. A few years before the show thatI am reviewing aired, a tv special of sorts was released in which the Care Bears ""battled"" against Professor Coldheart. I believe there were at least two specials: The Land Without Feelings and The Care Bears Battle the Cold Machine.",5,Not At All Scary,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,1138,"['completely', 'disagree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'stated', 'show', 'villians', 'would', 'frighten', 'young', 'children', 'Even', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'born', 'yet', 'when', 'episodes', 'were', 'originally', 'aired', 'watched', 'reruns', 'young', 'child', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'consider', 'Heart', 'be', 'scary', 'villian', 'henchmen', 'Beastly', 'Shrieky', 'were', 'far', 'terrfying', 'fact', 'were', 'center', 'many', 'hilarious', 'incidents', 'had', 'laughing', 'sides', 'hurt', 'sister', 'who', 'three', 'years', 'younger', 'am', 'watched', 'was', 'never', 'negatively', 'affected', 'only', 'remembers', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'show', 'loveable', 'characters', 'exciting', 'adventures', 'heart-warming', 'tales', 'friendship', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'watch', 'children.And', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'show', ""n't"", 'original', 'are', 'correct', 'few', 'years', 'show', 'am', 'reviewing', 'aired', 'tv', 'special', 'sorts', 'was', 'released', 'Care', 'Bears', 'battled', 'Professor', 'Coldheart', 'believe', 'were', 'least', 'two', 'specials', 'Land', 'Without', 'Feelings', 'Care', 'Bears', 'Battle', 'Cold', 'Machine']",N/A

I ain't never watch the whole entire series before, but I'm now experiencing it for the first time. here's the story, I was on YouTube and I was looking at a little clip of the second movie. It started to interest me. I started to love this song ""Forever Young"". And when I watch that clip again and again, I was like, ""You know what, let me check out the movie. It was wonderful. And immediately purchase the DVD. Then, I decided to look at some full episodes of the Original Classic Series. I watched 5 episodes. It's real intesting. I started to Love the Care Bears. I even seen the first movie. I have that too. So I decided to start my own Care Bears DVD collection. I currently got 2 movies and 5 of the Classic Series. My favorite episode out of these 4 is ""The Great Race"". Meanwhile, The only thing that I really don't understand is way Adeventures in Wonderland is not yet release on DVD. No Care Bear DVD collection is complete without the third movie. But I hope it have a DVD release soon. And I will not hesistate in buying it. I still want to see some more of the series though. I hope to get them all. I am aware that there is another series out on DVD from Dic, watch it's called Care Bears: Care-A-Lot Collection. I'm not getting that version, cause the animated on that version is kinda sloppy to me. No disrespect though. But I prefer the Nelvana version better. The animated on that version is perfect. The Care Bears is extremly entertaining.",5,Experiencing The Care Bears for the first time,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,1518,"['been', 'watching', 'Care', 'Bears', 'past', '5', 'months', 'ai', ""n't"", 'never', 'watch', 'whole', 'entire', 'series', ""'m"", 'now', 'experiencing', 'first', 'time', 'here', 'story', 'was', 'YouTube', 'was', 'looking', 'little', 'clip', 'second', 'movie', 'started', 'interest', 'started', 'love', 'song', 'Forever', 'Young', 'when', 'watch', 'clip', 'again', 'again', 'was', 'know', 'what', 'let', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderful', 'immediately', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'Then', 'decided', 'look', 'full', 'episodes', 'Original', 'Classic', 'Series', 'watched', '5', 'episodes', 'real', 'intesting', 'started', 'Love', 'Care', 'Bears', 'even', 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'too', 'decided', 'start', 'own', 'Care', 'Bears', 'DVD', 'collection', 'currently', 'got', '2', 'movies', '5', 'Classic', 'Series', 'My', 'favorite', 'episode', '4', 'Great', 'Race', 'Meanwhile', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'way', 'Adeventures', 'Wonderland', 'not', 'yet', 'release', 'DVD', 'No', 'Care', 'Bear', 'DVD', 'collection', 'complete', 'third', 'movie', 'hope', 'have', 'DVD', 'release', 'soon', 'will', 'not', 'hesistate', 'buying', 'still', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'series', 'hope', 'get', 'am', 'aware', 'series', 'out', 'DVD', 'Dic', 'watch', 'called', 'Care', 'Bears', 'Care-A-Lot', 'Collection', ""'m"", 'not', 'getting', 'version', 'cause', 'animated', 'version', 'kinda', 'sloppy', 'disrespect', 'prefer', 'Nelvana', 'version', 'better', 'animated', 'version', 'perfect', 'Care', 'Bears', 'extremly', 'entertaining']",N/A
