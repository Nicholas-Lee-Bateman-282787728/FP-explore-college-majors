1607004,AIAY6LI12U3VO,B00A92MG1A,book lvr,"[0, 0]",I grew up watching this show. With so many characters on it you could always find someone to relate to. This was a really good show that was not afraid to tackle tough issues. They did not feel the need to make the family life shown to be totally unrealistic. Some shows had the kids acting like little adults and always understanding everything that was done for them was for the best and there was no whining or anything. This show shows a more realistic side. Looking forward to more releases of the remaining seasons of this show.,5,Still just as good as I remember,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,534,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'could', 'always', 'find', 'someone', 'relate', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'tackle', 'tough', 'issues', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'need', 'make', 'family', 'life', 'shown', 'be', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'shows', 'had', 'kids', 'acting', 'little', 'adults', 'always', 'understanding', 'everything', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'best', 'was', 'whining', 'anything', 'show', 'more', 'realistic', 'side', 'Looking', 'forward', 'more', 'releases', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'show']",Eight Is Enough: The Complete Second Season Part 2
