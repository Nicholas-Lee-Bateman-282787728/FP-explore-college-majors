When they were bathing in the sea..and got out, their hair was dry, their clothes were dry 2, and its like they never bathed in the sea!Why is it called a movie when its not! This is a T.V series!When the 1st episode ended and the tekmate fell into the fountain and it ended i thought that it was the worst movie i've ever seen, but then i dont know why i just seeked forward and discovered that there r more episodes!Believe me its so lame!Maybe Jamie Spears is ok, she should act in movies, bcz this  not good enough 4 her, she  deserves better than acting inthis!",3,I dont know what to say...Ok...

This seemed like the best bet because it was more reasonable than buying a whole season. It has the Spring Break-up special and 2 other episodes.
