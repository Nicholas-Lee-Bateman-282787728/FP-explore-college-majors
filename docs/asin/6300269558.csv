For a small-budget film adaptation, you could do a lot worse. Astaire is uncharacteristically subtle but nonetheless lends a lot more depth to the character of Finian, originally an Irish caricature with no depth. He was as good an actor as he was a dancer, and his comic timing is flawless. Even in his sixties, the man is a machine.Coppola's version continues to have a bad reputation, one I assume will probably last forever. Why? Read on:1) - Negative portrayal of the deep south. The heroes live in a disgusting shantytown, while the evil Senator Rawkins resides in a hellish, antiquated mansion surrounded by dense jungle. I half expected Marlon Brando to wander out with a shaved head. Obviously, Rawkins' estate is meant to exaggerate his backwards thinking, but it comes off as a bit much.2) - Fred Astaire doesn't dance. Well....who cares? You're missing the point.3) - The movie is ""Marxist"". In reality, though, the plot has little to do with politics and more about making fun of hillbilly bigots.However, none of these reasons merit overlooking the excellent musical score. Each song is beautiful and memorable - which is more than you can say for a lot of musical comedies. The entire cast is great, even the irritating Tommy Steele, whose over-caffeinated mugging is well-suited for a Leprechaun, though not so good in other roles. The movie ended up chopping away a few songs, most notably ""Necessity"", which actually benefits it, in the long run.",4,It ain't Godfather III,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,1579,"['Having', 'recently', 'seen', 'broadway', 'revival', 'Finian', 'Rainbow', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'have', 'new', 'appreciation', 'film', 'small-budget', 'film', 'adaptation', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'Astaire', 'uncharacteristically', 'subtle', 'nonetheless', 'lot', 'more', 'depth', 'character', 'Finian', 'originally', 'Irish', 'caricature', 'depth', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'actor', 'was', 'dancer', 'comic', 'timing', 'flawless', 'Even', 'sixties', 'man', 'machine.Coppola', 'version', 'have', 'bad', 'reputation', 'one', 'assume', 'will', 'probably', 'last', 'forever', 'Why', 'Read', 'on:1', 'Negative', 'portrayal', 'deep', 'south', 'heroes', 'live', 'disgusting', 'shantytown', 'evil', 'Senator', 'Rawkins', 'hellish', 'antiquated', 'mansion', 'surrounded', 'dense', 'jungle', 'half', 'expected', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'wander', 'out', 'shaved', 'head', 'Obviously', 'Rawkins', 'estate', 'meant', 'exaggerate', 'backwards', 'thinking', 'off', 'bit', 'much.2', 'Fred', 'Astaire', ""n't"", 'dance', 'Well', '.who', 'cares', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point.3', 'movie', 'Marxist', 'reality', 'though', 'plot', 'little', 'do', 'politics', 'more', 'making', 'fun', 'hillbilly', 'bigots.However', 'none', 'reasons', 'merit', 'overlooking', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'song', 'beautiful', 'memorable', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'lot', 'musical', 'comedies', 'entire', 'cast', 'great', 'even', 'irritating', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'over-caffeinated', 'mugging', 'well-suited', 'Leprechaun', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'other', 'roles', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'chopping', 'away', 'few', 'songs', 'most', 'notably', 'Necessity', 'actually', 'benefits', 'long', 'run']",N/A

The stage production was first launched in 1947,but its allegedly socialist themes kept it off the silver screen until 1968. It was Fred Astaire's final film; it was also Francis Ford Coppola's directorial debut. George Lucas was an intern on the set.""Finian's Rainbow"" is about an old Irishman, Finian (Fred Astaire) who finds a pot of gold at the end of the legendary rainbow. Petula Clark stars as Finian's long-suffering daughter. The energetic Tommy Steele is the friendly leprechaun. Finian and his daughter find a multi-cultural commune, Rainbow Valley, where blacks and whites live together in peace. All is well. Until an evil Senator (Keenan Wynn) has his eyes on the land,as well as the pot of gold. The racist Senator is turned black thanks to the daughter's inadvertent wish. Since it is a fairy tale, good triumphs and everyone lives happily ever after.""Finian's Rainbow"" addressed '60s issues such as racism. It was psychedelic with its Rainbow Valley and leading leprechaun man. It has a good, perennial message. There is some strong singing and dancing.Unfortunately, ""Finian's Rainbow"" is heavy-handed. The pace lags. It's a sloooow movie. To make matters worse, the songs are forgettable... never a good sign in a musical. Luckily, Coppola grew from this movie.

I thought it would be interesting because Tommy Steele was so great in Disney's musical The Happiest Millionaire and because Keenan Wynn can be very funny, but in this movie, Tommy Steele acts more like he is on a drug high, and the songs in this had less to do with the plot than in most musicals.  For example, there's a lot of good dancing and there are some good tunes, but when everyone's spending the day running through the fields, and it has so little to do with the plot, you have to wonder what the point or current plot is.  The point at that particular part seems to be that everyone's happier in communal living, and the rest of the movie clarifies that communal living is specifically Marxist.  The messages of the movie are Marxist, and the writers of the musical also managed to put in a bit about witches overcoming discrimination, a big deal to the feminists of the 60s.  The Marxist message is more blatant than some of the reviewers here suggested, portraying Fred Astaire's character as greedy for wanting to keep his money and calling the rightful owner, the leprechaun (Tommy Steele), a member of a ""subversive underground group"" for wanting it.  The writers of the musical were Marxists or socialists who were portraying capitalists as selfish, accusatory hatemongers.  One last thing:  I felt that the movie's subplots weren't very well connected to each other until the end of the movie, and that the cuts in the movie were done in a very psychedelic, disjointed fashion, reflecting the hippie era that director Coppola apparently embraced.  All of these things were negative aspects to me.",2,Finian's Rainbow,1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,1801,"['opinion', 'not', 'well-crafted', 'story', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'really', 'certain', 'actor', 'actress', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'dance', 'last', 'role', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'Disney', 'musical', 'Happiest', 'Millionaire', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'more', 'drug', 'high', 'songs', 'had', 'less', 'do', 'plot', 'most', 'musicals', 'example', 'lot', 'good', 'dancing', 'are', 'good', 'tunes', 'when', 'everyone', 'spending', 'day', 'running', 'fields', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'plot', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', 'current', 'plot', 'point', 'particular', 'part', 'be', 'everyone', 'happier', 'communal', 'living', 'rest', 'movie', 'communal', 'living', 'specifically', 'Marxist', 'messages', 'movie', 'are', 'Marxist', 'writers', 'musical', 'also', 'managed', 'put', 'bit', 'witches', 'overcoming', 'discrimination', 'big', 'deal', 'feminists', '60s', 'Marxist', 'message', 'more', 'blatant', 'reviewers', 'here', 'suggested', 'portraying', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'character', 'greedy', 'wanting', 'keep', 'money', 'calling', 'rightful', 'owner', 'leprechaun', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'member', 'subversive', 'underground', 'group', 'wanting', 'writers', 'musical', 'were', 'Marxists', 'socialists', 'who', 'were', 'portraying', 'capitalists', 'selfish', 'accusatory', 'hatemongers', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'felt', 'movie', 'subplots', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'connected', 'other', 'end', 'movie', 'cuts', 'movie', 'were', 'done', 'very', 'psychedelic', 'disjointed', 'fashion', 'reflecting', 'hippie', 'era', 'director', 'Coppola', 'apparently', 'embraced', 'things', 'were', 'negative', 'aspects']",N/A

234986,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6300269558,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[54, 61]","Opening on Broadway in 1947 with music by Burton Lane and lyrics by E.Y. ""Yip"" Harburg (who wrote the lyrics for 1939's THE WIZARD OF OZ), FINIAN'S RAINBOW was an unexpected smash that generated one pop classic after another--""How Are Things In Glocca Morra?,"" ""Old Devil Moon,"" and ""Look To The Rainbow"" to name but three.  But when talk turned to a film version, not a single studio in Hollywood would touch it: although the story was fantasy, it was also extremely satirical, contained elements that had a decidedly socialist edge, and made one of the most wickedly funny statements on racism seen up to that time.  With Hollywood operating under the production code and the nation drifting into the communist paranoia of the 1950s, the whole thing was impossibly hot.  And so FINIAN'S RAINBOW remained off the screen for over twenty years... until 1968, when a sudden splash of popular screen musicals prompted Warner Brothers to bankroll it.The plot is deliberately ridiculous, and finds Irishman Finian McLonergan (Fred Astaire) and his long suffering daughter Sharon in Tennessee, where Finian plans to bury a crock of gold stolen from a leprechan (Tommy Steele) on the theory that the land around Fort Knox will make the gold grow.  But things take an unexpected turn when they arrive in Rainbow Valley, where they encounter a commune-like community of black and white tobacco sharecroppers who are doing battle with a viciously bigoted Senator (Keenan Wynn.) And when daughter Sharon is outraged by the Senator's racism and happens to be standing by the hidden crock of gold--she accidentally ""wishes"" the Senator black!Unlike the 1947 stage show, the big screen version of FINIAN'S RAINBOW tanked at the box office, and it is little wonder: both producers and then-novice director Francis Ford Coppola made a host of very basic mistakes with the material, the first of which was not keeping the film consistently within its original 1940s context; they instead give it a 'contemporary' tone that not only undercuts the fanciful storyline but makes many of the story's elements seem heavy-handed.  In the process they manage to blunt the edge of the original in a very significant sort of way.  There are also a number of cinematic problems with the movie, which feels awkwardly filmed and still more awkwardly edited, and the film visibly shifts between outdoor set-ups and studio soundstage sets in a very uncomfortable sort of way.All of that said, there is still a great deal to enjoy in FINIAN'S RAINBOW--the aforementioned score for one and the truly memorable performances for another.  Astaire is timeless, Tommy Steele almost walks away with the show, Keegan Wynn--in spite of some rather ill-advised make-up--gives a memorable performance as the bigoted Senator, and Al Freeman Jr. is absolutely hilarious in the sequence where he applies for the job of butler in the Senator's home--I laugh just thinking about it!  But the real revelation here is Petula Clark.  Best known as a pop singer, Clark is perfection as Sharon McLonergan; it is a tremendous pity that she was never again so well-cast on screen.  And together they manage to gloss over most of the film's weaknesses; if you're a musical fan, you're likely to enjoy it.A word of warning, however.  At present, FINIAN'S RAINBOW exists only on videotape, and while the VHS release is not bad per se, it is also pan-and-scan.  Admittedly, the cinematography wasn't much to begin with, but purists (of which I am one when it comes to ratios) will be frustrated.",4,Wonderful Performances In A Deeply Flawed Film,1049932800,"04 10, 2003",2003,3536,"['Opening', 'Broadway', '1947', 'music', 'Burton', 'Lane', 'lyrics', 'E.Y', 'Yip', 'Harburg', 'who', 'wrote', 'lyrics', '1939', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'FINIAN', 'RAINBOW', 'was', 'unexpected', 'smash', 'generated', 'one', 'pop', 'classic', 'How', 'Are', 'Things', 'Glocca', 'Morra', 'Old', 'Devil', 'Moon', 'Look', 'Rainbow', 'name', 'three', 'when', 'talk', 'turned', 'film', 'version', 'not', 'single', 'studio', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'touch', 'story', 'was', 'fantasy', 'was', 'also', 'extremely', 'satirical', 'contained', 'elements', 'had', 'decidedly', 'socialist', 'edge', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'statements', 'racism', 'seen', 'up', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'operating', 'production', 'code', 'nation', 'drifting', 'communist', 'paranoia', '1950s', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'impossibly', 'hot', 'so', 'FINIAN', 'RAINBOW', 'remained', 'off', 'screen', 'twenty', 'years', '1968', 'when', 'sudden', 'splash', 'popular', 'screen', 'musicals', 'prompted', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'bankroll', 'it.The', 'plot', 'deliberately', 'ridiculous', 'Irishman', 'Finian', 'McLonergan', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'long', 'suffering', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'Tennessee', 'where', 'Finian', 'plans', 'bury', 'crock', 'gold', 'stolen', 'leprechan', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'theory', 'land', 'Fort', 'Knox', 'will', 'make', 'gold', 'grow', 'things', 'take', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'when', 'arrive', 'Rainbow', 'Valley', 'where', 'encounter', 'commune-like', 'community', 'black', 'white', 'tobacco', 'sharecroppers', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'battle', 'viciously', 'bigoted', 'Senator', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'when', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'outraged', 'Senator', 'racism', 'be', 'standing', 'hidden', 'crock', 'gold', 'accidentally', 'wishes', 'Senator', 'black', '1947', 'stage', 'show', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'FINIAN', 'RAINBOW', 'tanked', 'box', 'office', 'little', 'wonder', 'producers', 'then-novice', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'made', 'host', 'very', 'basic', 'mistakes', 'material', 'first', 'was', 'not', 'keeping', 'film', 'consistently', 'original', '1940s', 'context', 'instead', 'give', ""'contemporary"", 'tone', 'not', 'only', 'fanciful', 'storyline', 'many', 'story', 'elements', 'seem', 'heavy-handed', 'process', 'manage', 'blunt', 'edge', 'original', 'very', 'significant', 'sort', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'cinematic', 'problems', 'movie', 'awkwardly', 'filmed', 'still', 'more', 'awkwardly', 'edited', 'film', 'visibly', 'shifts', 'outdoor', 'set-ups', 'studio', 'soundstage', 'sets', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'sort', 'way.All', 'said', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'enjoy', 'FINIAN', 'RAINBOW', 'aforementioned', 'score', 'one', 'truly', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Astaire', 'timeless', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'almost', 'away', 'show', 'Keegan', 'Wynn', 'spite', 'rather', 'ill-advised', 'make-up', 'memorable', 'performance', 'bigoted', 'Senator', 'Al', 'Freeman', 'Jr.', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'sequence', 'where', 'job', 'butler', 'Senator', 'home', 'laugh', 'just', 'thinking', 'real', 'revelation', 'here', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'Best', 'known', 'pop', 'singer', 'Clark', 'perfection', 'Sharon', 'McLonergan', 'tremendous', 'pity', 'was', 'never', 'again', 'so', 'well-cast', 'screen', 'together', 'manage', 'gloss', 'most', 'film', 'weaknesses', ""'re"", 'musical', 'fan', ""'re"", 'likely', 'enjoy', 'it.A', 'word', 'warning', 'however', 'present', 'FINIAN', 'RAINBOW', 'only', 'videotape', 'VHS', 'release', 'not', 'bad', 'se', 'also', 'pan-and-scan', 'Admittedly', 'cinematography', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'begin', 'purists', 'am', 'one', 'when', 'ratios', 'will', 'be', 'frustrated']",N/A
234987,AU10YGO10MUCA,6300269558,Gary Lee,"[3, 5]","I watched this film because it was Fred Astaire's last musical role.  Otherwise, I knew nothing more about it than that it costarred Petula Clark, was directed by Francis Ford Coppola in 1968, and is based on an old Broadway musical containing some well-known songs.I watched with an open mind, and was very soon agape with disbelief at what I was seeing.  It is difficult to describe how bad this film is.  It is inept in nearly every aspect:  script, direction, dialogue, acting, sets, lighting, editing, cinematography, choreography, sound mixing.  It is, in a word, gruesome.Just some random samples:An actual song lyric:  ""I'm bustin' with bliss and I'll kiss your ass if this isn't love.""An actual schtick:  a senator's assistant teaches Al Freeman's character how to shuck and jive according to the most blatant racial stereotypes imaginable.  Yes, I know it's supposed to satirize those racist attitudes.  The supposed ""humor"" only turned my stomach.After a sketchy overture that sounds like elevator muzak, we see what has to be the most bizarre series of shots in movie history:  Clark and Astaire walk through a wheat field carrying their worldly belongings on a trek across America.  We don't know yet who these characters are, where they are going, or why, but this is the exact order of the shots:  They hike past the Statue of Liberty, then they've abruptly crossed the continent to pass the Golden Gate Bridge.  Next they're in Monument Valley in Northern Arizona, then scrambling over boulders on the slopes beneath the faces of Mt. Rushmore (first movie stars to be up there since Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint in NORTH BY NORTHWEST).  Suitcases in hand, our intrepid pilgrims are next seen traversing down on a narrow ridge in the Grand Canyon!  Undaunted, they then ride a boat on a river, continue on their stroll over a natural bridge in Southern Utah, slide down a snow-covered mountain incline, cross a plain with cows and distant mountains (Montana?), only to end up in mountain terrain once again in what looks like Glacier National Park.  They turn up next in the town of Bodega in Northern California (another Hitchcock tribute--they're in front the Potter School, where Tippi Hedren and the schoolkids fled from murderous crows in THE BIRDS).  Escaping from there unpecked, they pass a foggy San Francisco vista, to finally end up on a road through farmland in the Midwest.  It is the most scrambled piece of geography since Columbus thought he'd landed in India.The plot is a mash-up of leprechauns, Southern racists, happy blacks, a mute, a stolen pot of gold that everyone lifts as effortlessly as an empty wastebasket, witchcraft, show biz in-jokes, class conflict, Fred Astaire's signature dance moves, tobacco farming, and of course, young love (sigh) that is totally nonsensical and completely cringe-worthy.  There's no main story, just a passel of ridiculous subplots.  Each scene seems to come from a different show.  E.Y. Harburg could only have devised this travesty while delirious with malaria.  It offends on so many levels.There is not one shred of authentic human emotion in this film, not one believable situation (or accent), not one set that looks real.  The whole thing is stagey, not in the least cinematic.  The familiar Broadway score pops up here and there and is nicely sung by the principals, but who cares?  The music is lost in the shuffle, and cannot save this leaden mess.  The unbelievably obnoxious Tommy Steele, as Og the Leprechaun, was obviously shipped to U.S. shores as punishment for the Revolution.The film is unwatchable, and such a sad desecration of the artistic legacy of Fred Astaire.  A send-up of racial attitudes in  the 1940's was no longer relevant at the end of the social upheaval of the 1960's, and that the filmmakers could not figure that out is the real embarrassment of this awful movie.",1,Atrocious,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,3874,"['watched', 'film', 'was', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'last', 'musical', 'role', 'Otherwise', 'knew', 'nothing', 'more', 'costarred', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'was', 'directed', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', '1968', 'based', 'old', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'containing', 'well-known', 'songs.I', 'watched', 'open', 'mind', 'was', 'very', 'soon', 'agape', 'disbelief', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'difficult', 'describe', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'inept', 'nearly', 'aspect', 'script', 'direction', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'sets', 'lighting', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'sound', 'mixing', 'word', 'gruesome.Just', 'random', 'samples', 'actual', 'song', 'lyric', ""'m"", 'bustin', 'bliss', ""'ll"", 'kiss', 'ass', ""n't"", 'love', 'actual', 'schtick', 'senator', 'assistant', 'teaches', 'Al', 'Freeman', 'character', 'how', 'shuck', 'jive', 'according', 'most', 'blatant', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'imaginable', 'Yes', 'know', 'supposed', 'satirize', 'racist', 'attitudes', 'supposed', 'humor', 'only', 'turned', 'stomach.After', 'sketchy', 'overture', 'elevator', 'muzak', 'see', 'what', 'be', 'most', 'bizarre', 'series', 'shots', 'movie', 'history', 'Clark', 'Astaire', 'walk', 'wheat', 'field', 'carrying', 'worldly', 'belongings', 'trek', 'America', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'why', 'exact', 'order', 'shots', 'hike', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'then', ""'ve"", 'abruptly', 'crossed', 'continent', 'pass', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', ""'re"", 'Monument', 'Valley', 'Northern', 'Arizona', 'then', 'scrambling', 'over', 'boulders', 'slopes', 'Mt', 'Rushmore', 'first', 'movie', 'stars', 'be', 'up', 'there', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'NORTH', 'BY', 'NORTHWEST', 'hand', 'intrepid', 'pilgrims', 'are', 'next', 'seen', 'traversing', 'down', 'narrow', 'ridge', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'Undaunted', 'then', 'ride', 'boat', 'river', 'continue', 'stroll', 'natural', 'bridge', 'Southern', 'Utah', 'slide', 'down', 'snow-covered', 'mountain', 'incline', 'cross', 'plain', 'cows', 'distant', 'mountains', 'Montana', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'mountain', 'terrain', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'Glacier', 'National', 'Park', 'turn', 'up', 'next', 'town', 'Bodega', 'Northern', 'California', 'Hitchcock', 'tribute', ""'re"", 'front', 'Potter', 'School', 'where', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'schoolkids', 'fled', 'murderous', 'crows', 'THE', 'BIRDS', 'Escaping', 'unpecked', 'pass', 'foggy', 'San', 'Francisco', 'vista', 'finally', 'end', 'up', 'road', 'farmland', 'Midwest', 'most', 'scrambled', 'piece', 'geography', 'Columbus', 'thought', ""'d"", 'landed', 'India.The', 'plot', 'mash-up', 'leprechauns', 'Southern', 'racists', 'happy', 'blacks', 'mute', 'stolen', 'pot', 'gold', 'everyone', 'lifts', 'as', 'effortlessly', 'empty', 'wastebasket', 'witchcraft', 'show', 'biz', 'in-jokes', 'class', 'conflict', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'signature', 'dance', 'moves', 'tobacco', 'farming', 'course', 'young', 'love', 'sigh', 'totally', 'nonsensical', 'completely', 'cringe-worthy', 'main', 'story', 'just', 'passel', 'ridiculous', 'subplots', 'scene', 'come', 'different', 'show', 'E.Y', 'Harburg', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'devised', 'travesty', 'delirious', 'malaria', 'so', 'many', 'levels.There', 'not', 'one', 'shred', 'authentic', 'human', 'emotion', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'believable', 'situation', 'accent', 'not', 'one', 'set', 'real', 'whole', 'thing', 'stagey', 'not', 'least', 'cinematic', 'familiar', 'Broadway', 'score', 'here', 'there', 'nicely', 'sung', 'principals', 'who', 'music', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'leaden', 'mess', 'unbelievably', 'obnoxious', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'Og', 'Leprechaun', 'was', 'obviously', 'shipped', 'U.S.', 'shores', 'punishment', 'Revolution.The', 'film', 'unwatchable', 'sad', 'desecration', 'artistic', 'legacy', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'send-up', 'racial', 'attitudes', '1940', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'relevant', 'end', 'social', 'upheaval', '1960', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'real', 'embarrassment', 'awful', 'movie']",N/A
234988,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,6300269558,Gary P. Cohen,"[1, 1]","I remember seeing ""Finian's Rainbow"" in the movies and loving the soundtrack.  I played the album over and over.  I just watched the film again on DVD and my thought remain the same.  It is not a great movie by any means, but the music is still terrific.  Lets face it, the film is the legendary Fred Astaire's last musical and features some nice dance numbers by the master.  It also co-stars the lovely Petula Clark, with her sweet and clear voice, as Fred's daughter.  However the plot is silly at best.  Based on a 1947 Broadway musical, the film about a happy little village, somewhere down South, where blacks and whites live happily until menaced by a white, racist Senator and his stooges, the plotline was dated by time the film was made in 1967.  Into the village comes Irish immigrant Finian and his daughter Sharon.  Finian has stolen a pot of gold from the leprecahns and means to bury it in the hope that it will grow into millions. (See I told you that the plot was silly.)This was Francis Ford Coppola's first major directing job and I listened to his commentary on the DVD.  Some of it was fairly interesting (although he did have a tendency to repeat the same story numerous times.)  You can tell he was disappointed with the film.  He speaks over and over about his mistake in not involving himself in the editing of the film.  As soon as the film was completed, he immediately left to begin another film.  He now speaks about the fact that many scenes went on too long and he would have cut them down.  He talks about letting the music carry the film with shorter scenes in between.  I agree with him: the film is way too long and not greatly memorable other than the musical numbers.  Coppola also mentions that this was a modestly budgeted film.  Yet it was released as a reserved-seat, roadshow attraction with an intermission.  He was surprised about this since the film was not a vastly expensive epic. (This was the tail-end of the big budget musical. ""Fianian's Rainbow"" along with other higher  budgeted musicals like ""Star,"" ""Hello Dolly,"" ""Half a Sixpence,"" etc were all released during this period and flopped. ""Finians"" was filmed at the back lot at Warner Bros. which was also used for another big-budget, musical failure: ""Camelot."")  As stated, the commentary was fairly interesting and you will learn some things you might not have known about this film.  However, as stated, he does tend to repeat himself a lot, be prepared.  He then abruptly ends the commentary at the conclusion without a ""Thank You"" or ""Goodbye"" (I find this fairly annoying. If you have taken two and a half hours to listen to his memories of the film, the least he could do is acknowledge it in some way at the conclusion of the commentary.)The picture quality is excellent and the disc includes a half-hour tv special at the New York premiere of ""Finian's Rainbow.""  Interviewed are Astaire, Coppola and all major cast members except Petula who couldn't make it (although there is a tape of her thanking everybody.)In conclusion, Fred, Petula and Tommy Steele as ""Og the Leprecahn"" are all excellent and  the songs and musical numbers are all great.

Between songs and dances like 'Woody's Here' and 'How Are Things In Glocka Morra' the town battles against the intense, ramshackle house-living Senator, played by Keenan Wynn.

235006,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6300269558,Only-A-Child,"[2, 2]","""Finian's Rainbow"" (1968) is one of the few films I saw three times in the theater, and since repeat viewings are normally not my thing it must have made some connection or maybe I just enjoyed watching Barbara Hancock dance. Despite this I agree with most of the critical comments about portions of the film.Unfortunately it was assembled as a 145 minute ""roadshow"" musical; these were overlong spectaculars which depended less on the charm of the performers (think 1930's) than on pre-sold event marketing (unnecessary, pretentious, overscale, and distracting production values; souvenir programs; etc.). Right around the time of its release these mega-productions were leading many of the studios to financial ruin. Warner Brothers took a hit from this one; box office was bad but fortunately Coppola worked cheap and had cranked this out on the back-lot with a relatively modest budget.Trim about 30 minutes from the film and you would have a much better production. There is a lot of stuff here that is supposed to be fun and just doesn't make it. Fortunately there are some real gems sandwiched throughout the film.Think bi-racial ""Lil Abner"" (1959) with a touch of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939). The Oz connection comes from lyricist E. Y. Harburg, the guy who gave us ""If I Were the King of the Forest"". There are enough such silly songs to make up for toughing out the musical clunker moments. Tommy Steele absolutely shines doing this material (insert Bert Lahr here) .Nothing wrong with the performances of Fred Astaire or Petula Clark either. And its not just his dancing and her singing, they both achieve excellent characterizations. Astaire at 70 does not look much different facially than Astaire at 30. But this time instead of a physically unlikely love interest he plays a warm old man still chasing a dream, and it's a much better fit. Clark does an excellent Debbie Reynolds and more than holds her own through the production.Unfortunately there is little good to say about the casting of Don Francks as Petula's love interest and Hancock's older brother. Most likely Coppola felt that the film needed a relatively hip looking guy in place of a Gordon MacRae type. But Francks comes off as more of an oily hotshot; the kind of guy who would proposition your 14 year-old sister.The plot has Finian and his daughter coming to Kentucky to bury a crock of gold he has stolen from a leprechaun back in Ireland. Finian believes that he can produce some kind of synergy by getting the gold within close range of Ft. Knox. They end up in a racially mixed Dogpatch named Rainbow Valley, where blacks and whites work side-by-side as tobacco sharecroppers. There is considerable intrigue involving the local racist political hacks, a new strain of mentholated tobacco being developed by a George Washington Carver type (nicely played by Al Freeman Jr.), back taxes on the sharecropping collective, romance, and a leprechaun who is slowly becoming human.Barbara Hancock, a young but quite accomplished ballet dancer, is fetching as ""Susan the Silent"" (who dances instead of talking). Coppola adds a lot of nice lyrical moments by showcasing her dancing. It is said that Astaire resented her being cast instead of an older dancer he recommended. They are not paired in any number, a failure conspicuous by its absence.The widescreen DVD looks great and the Coppola commentary is surprisingly interesting.Then again, what do I know?

Bayerl ""Specialist in having fun""","[3, 3]","Finian's Rainbow has a way of building on the viewer and listener with each new encounter, though an objective study of its merits makes it hard to determine just why.  Maybe it's the casting of such characters as those played by Astaire, Steele and Wynn, who seem to embody archetypes woven throughout the literature of the screen.  The film certainly has its share of all-out exuberance, to suggest something rightfully sited in such Summer of Love days as 1968.  So many of the scenes, too, are of folks with so little formal social structure, aside from that imposed by Senator Rawkins, his troopers and by analogy, his dogs.  One often has the image of folks with too much time on their hands, looking for yet another reason to have a party.  So it is, into this waiting collection of hedonistic yet well-intentioned expectations that Og the Leprechaun can inspire such furious action.  The whole set of affairs is a surreal one, and even ridiculous at times, given a basic knowledge of American pop culture, only the viewer cannot help but be swept into the momentum of the assorted proceedings, both musical and verbal alike.

But, he still dances and sings like he did in his heyday and looks good for his age in this film adaptation of Finian's Rainbow. He is age appropriate for his character and has a convincing Irish accent as well..Petula Clark sings and acts up a storm worthy of a Golden Globe but her nomination led to a loss to the queen of American Musicals, Barbara Streisand for Funny Girl.  It doesn't make her performance any less stellar. It's a shame she didn't make more musicals in America.... She would have given Barbara a run for her money.The remainder of the cast is amazing as well. Especially Tommy Steele. However, I wish they'd at least dyed his hair red! Otherwise he plays a mischievous leprechaun to perfection and I can't see why anyone would make any other comments about his performance.Don Franks, Keenan Wynn & Barbara Hancock are all priceless and round out a firm and exceptionally talented cast.It is hard to believe that this film is directed by the same man who directed &#34;The Godfather&#34;, but, it is. Considering the material, he did a pretty good job.What I find truly disappointing is that the director points out only the things he thinks are wrong with the film in his commentary on the DVD release when there is so much about the film that is right.The DVD release returns the film to it's original format (Widescreen). All of Fred's foot work and the full picture is shown in this format and it's beautiful to watch. Fred dances up a storm and Petula keeps up with him without any problems. However this film doesn't have as many dance numbers or big production dance numbers as Fred's older work.I can't believe that I waited this long to watch this film. I wish now I'd seen it in the theater. I'm sure it was wonderful on the big screen.Between the &#34;controversial for the time&#34; subject matter of race and witchcraft (complete with a few racial slurs), it remains timeless and relevant to this day and well worth the price of admission no matter if your a fan of American Musicals or not..",5,The Last Great American Musical - Highly Underrated,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,2081,"['Fred', 'Astaire', 'was', '70', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'still', 'sings', 'did', 'heyday', 'good', 'age', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Finian', 'Rainbow', 'age', 'appropriate', 'character', 'convincing', 'Irish', 'accent', 'well..Petula', 'Clark', 'sings', 'up', 'storm', 'worthy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'led', 'loss', 'queen', 'American', 'Musicals', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'Funny', 'Girl', ""n't"", 'make', 'performance', 'less', 'stellar', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'musicals', 'America', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Barbara', 'run', 'money.The', 'remainder', 'cast', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'Especially', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'However', 'wish', ""'d"", 'least', 'dyed', 'hair', 'red', 'Otherwise', 'mischievous', 'leprechaun', 'perfection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'make', 'other', 'comments', 'performance.Don', 'Franks', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Barbara', 'Hancock', 'are', 'priceless', 'round', 'firm', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'cast.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'film', 'directed', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'directed', '34', 'Godfather', '34', 'Considering', 'material', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job.What', 'find', 'truly', 'disappointing', 'director', 'out', 'only', 'things', 'are', 'wrong', 'film', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'release', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'right.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'original', 'format', 'Widescreen', 'Fred', 'foot', 'work', 'full', 'picture', 'shown', 'format', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'Fred', 'up', 'storm', 'Petula', 'up', 'problems', 'However', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'many', 'dance', 'numbers', 'big', 'production', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Fred', 'older', 'work.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'waited', 'long', 'watch', 'film', 'wish', 'now', ""'d"", 'seen', 'theater', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'wonderful', 'big', 'screen.Between', '34', 'controversial', 'time', '34', 'subject', 'matter', 'race', 'witchcraft', 'complete', 'few', 'racial', 'slurs', 'timeless', 'relevant', 'day', 'well', 'price', 'admission', 'matter', 'fan', 'American', 'Musicals', 'not..']",N/A

It was grand how the question of ""color of people"" was addressed in the program by ""Og"" (Tommy Sands) What a great word...he had been green at one time!! (Reminds me a bit of how the ""newer"" cartoons do purple hair, orange people, etc. :)!)  What a great word the child asks ""Is [the child's name] the wrong color?"" and Petula Clark says 'no' in such a caring manner.

It was great and I would love the whole family to watch it together - and the parents can explain any subjects they might feel they have to address for clarity, but it really takes very good care of that in the film! (The little bit of leprachaun 'magic' was not too offensive even for me as one that disapproves of children seeing that.) And when it was done, Og spoke of the true change needed to be done in the heart! And Keenan Wynn, one may not care for his character to begin with, but what a turn around!

On the one hand we have beautiful cinematography, and some truly classic songs sung and danced by top talent. I LOVE the title song Look to the Rainbow. But then on the other we have a director who can't seem to make up his mind whether he wants to film this movie in the great outdoors (get a load of those huge musical numbers featuring enough people to have a convention), or indoors (in sets that feel like they were swiped from Camelot or Brigadoon). On the one hand we have some great actors Fred Astaire, Tommy Steele, and Petula Clark (I think I'm in love). And let's not forget the at times hilarious dialog (""It's an angel!

That and the glorious use of widescreen and color.But again, the switching back and forth from studio set to outdoor helicopter shot feels...strange.

235017,A1103Y2G3Y7TEO,6300269558,"Thomas C. Rizzo, Jr.","[8, 10]","The film version of ""Finian's Rainbow"" was conceived at a time when the public's interest in movie musicals was on the wane; in fact, in light of the poor critical reception accorded ""Camelot"", studio head Jack Warner would have been content to pull the plug on what he perceived as another sure-fire disaster. To an extent, his feelings were justified - what had been a daringly provocative look at racial strife in the deep American South as seen through the eyes of a scheming Irishman and his less-than-supportive daughter when it debuted on Broadway in 1947 was no longer very pertinent, and the fairy tale aspects of the plot - which included the hyperactive antics of a leprachaun intent on retrieving his ""borrowed"" pot of gold - were going to be a hard sell in 1968. The score, although exquisitely timeless and highly recognizable, was old-fashioned in its theatricality and not likely to result in a best-selling cast album. Furthermore, directing the project was a virtual unknown, a ""hippie"" from northern California named Francis Ford Coppola, with only one prior film - a non-musical - to his credit. Given the odds the movie was doomed, Warner basically maintained a ""hands-off, don't-ask, don't-tell"" policy and simply hoped for the best.The end result may not have been the ""best"", but it is considerably better than most critics described it upon its release. The overlong book, with several insignificant sub-plots, could have used some judicious trimming. Tommy Steele's performance as Og, the slowly-turning-into-a-human leprechaun, is frantically overblown. And the attempt to blend reality and make-believe results in an awkwardly uneven balance of the two - Coppola would have been far more successful had he decided to emphasize the whimsey and play down the outdated political aspects of the story.But for all these shortcomings, ""Finian's Rainbow"" - from its spectacular opening credits to its nicely staged farewell to Finian - almost a goodbye to Astaire himself, for whom this would be his last dancing role - is pleasant entertainment, buoyed by its familiar score and anchored by the presence of Petula Clark, whose delightfully fresh and sweetly seductive performance is the true gold to be discovered here. At the time known in the States as a pop singer best known for the mega-hit ""Downtown"", Clark drew on her previous experience as an actress in mostly grade-B British films and developed a character whose acceptance of a leprechaun hiding in the backyard well is as easily believed as her skepticism regarding her father's plot to multiply his borrowed gold by burying it in the shadows of Fort Knox and her fiance's plans to grow mentholated tobacco. The Arlen/Harburg score - including such standards as ""How Are Things in Glocca Morra?"" and ""Look to the Rainbow"" - could well have been composed specifically for her voice, which wraps itself around each note with a hint of a brogue and - in the case of ""Old Devil Moon"" - a raw sensuality suggesting the woman inside the sweet Irish colleen. Her portrayal of Sharon McLonergan rightfully earned her a Best Actress Golden Globe nomination.Unfortunately, Clark wasn't invited to participate in the commentary added to the DVD release - her recollections would have been a welcome bonus.  The chat is left solely to Coppola, who does a fine job discussing, in addition to his direction of the film, its difficult evolvement during the downfall of the studio system.  Other extras include the original trailer and a featurette focusing on the movie's world premiere. Oddly missing is the production number ""Necessity"" - which was cut before the film's release - suggesting it wasn't to be found in the Warner vaults.In addition to providing crisper images and sound, the DVD's biggest bonus reverses a serious error in the theatrical and video releases.  The original film's editing was criminal in that Fred Astaire's feet were often unseen in his dance routines, but in the transfer to DVD, his full body thankfully is now in view.",4,"""RAINBOW"" SPARKLES ON DVD",971222400,"10 11, 2000",2000,4024,"['film', 'version', 'Finian', 'Rainbow', 'was', 'conceived', 'time', 'when', 'public', 'interest', 'movie', 'musicals', 'was', 'wane', 'fact', 'light', 'poor', 'critical', 'reception', 'accorded', 'Camelot', 'studio', 'head', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'content', 'pull', 'plug', 'what', 'perceived', 'sure-fire', 'disaster', 'extent', 'feelings', 'were', 'justified', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'daringly', 'provocative', 'look', 'racial', 'strife', 'deep', 'American', 'South', 'seen', 'eyes', 'scheming', 'Irishman', 'less-than-supportive', 'daughter', 'when', 'debuted', 'Broadway', '1947', 'was', 'longer', 'very', 'pertinent', 'fairy', 'tale', 'aspects', 'plot', 'included', 'hyperactive', 'antics', 'leprachaun', 'intent', 'retrieving', 'borrowed', 'pot', 'gold', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'sell', '1968', 'score', 'exquisitely', 'timeless', 'highly', 'recognizable', 'was', 'old-fashioned', 'theatricality', 'not', 'likely', 'result', 'best-selling', 'cast', 'album', 'Furthermore', 'directing', 'project', 'was', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'hippie', 'northern', 'California', 'named', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'only', 'one', 'prior', 'film', 'non-musical', 'credit', 'Given', 'odds', 'movie', 'was', 'doomed', 'Warner', 'basically', 'maintained', 'hands-off', ""don't-ask"", ""don't-tell"", 'policy', 'simply', 'hoped', 'best.The', 'end', 'result', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'considerably', 'better', 'most', 'critics', 'described', 'release', 'overlong', 'book', 'several', 'insignificant', 'sub-plots', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'judicious', 'trimming', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'performance', 'Og', 'slowly-turning-into-a-human', 'leprechaun', 'frantically', 'overblown', 'attempt', 'blend', 'reality', 'make-believe', 'results', 'awkwardly', 'uneven', 'balance', 'two', 'Coppola', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'had', 'decided', 'emphasize', 'whimsey', 'play', 'down', 'outdated', 'political', 'aspects', 'story.But', 'shortcomings', 'Finian', 'Rainbow', 'spectacular', 'opening', 'credits', 'nicely', 'staged', 'farewell', 'Finian', 'almost', 'goodbye', 'Astaire', 'whom', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'dancing', 'role', 'pleasant', 'entertainment', 'buoyed', 'familiar', 'score', 'anchored', 'presence', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'delightfully', 'fresh', 'sweetly', 'seductive', 'performance', 'true', 'gold', 'be', 'discovered', 'here', 'time', 'known', 'States', 'pop', 'singer', 'best', 'known', 'mega-hit', 'Downtown', 'Clark', 'drew', 'previous', 'experience', 'actress', 'mostly', 'grade-B', 'British', 'films', 'developed', 'character', 'acceptance', 'leprechaun', 'hiding', 'backyard', 'well', 'easily', 'believed', 'skepticism', 'regarding', 'father', 'plot', 'multiply', 'borrowed', 'gold', 'burying', 'shadows', 'Fort', 'Knox', 'fiance', 'plans', 'grow', 'mentholated', 'tobacco', 'Arlen/Harburg', 'score', 'including', 'such', 'standards', 'How', 'Are', 'Things', 'Glocca', 'Morra', 'Look', 'Rainbow', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'composed', 'specifically', 'voice', 'note', 'hint', 'brogue', 'case', 'Old', 'Devil', 'Moon', 'raw', 'sensuality', 'suggesting', 'woman', 'sweet', 'Irish', 'colleen', 'portrayal', 'Sharon', 'McLonergan', 'rightfully', 'earned', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination.Unfortunately', 'Clark', 'was', ""n't"", 'invited', 'participate', 'commentary', 'added', 'DVD', 'release', 'recollections', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'bonus', 'chat', 'left', 'solely', 'Coppola', 'who', 'fine', 'job', 'discussing', 'addition', 'direction', 'film', 'difficult', 'evolvement', 'downfall', 'studio', 'system', 'Other', 'extras', 'include', 'original', 'trailer', 'featurette', 'focusing', 'movie', 'world', 'premiere', 'Oddly', 'missing', 'production', 'number', 'Necessity', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'release', 'suggesting', 'was', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'Warner', 'vaults.In', 'addition', 'providing', 'crisper', 'images', 'sound', 'DVD', 'biggest', 'bonus', 'serious', 'error', 'theatrical', 'video', 'releases', 'original', 'film', 'editing', 'was', 'criminal', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'feet', 'were', 'often', 'unseen', 'dance', 'routines', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'full', 'body', 'thankfully', 'now', 'view']",N/A

235019,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6300269558,Trevor Willsmer,"[10, 10]","Roguish Irishman Finian McLonergan (Fred Astaire) arrives in Rainbow Valley near Fort Knox with his daughter Sharon (Petula Clark) to test out his theory of economics - that if he plants a crock of gold stolen from the leprechauns, it will grow. Unfortunately for his plans, a Leprechaun (Tommy Steele) has followed him to retrieve the gold, a racist senator wants to buy the land he has buried it in and his daughter is accused of witchcraft when an ill-advised wish comes true...Unlike many of the roadshow musicals of the Sixties, Finian's Rainbow doesn't feel overlong or overblown - despite being shot in 70mm, it keeps the scale small and retains much of the charm of the original show in the process. The direction is energetic and fluid, with  some beautiful camerawork and the odd experimental touches  - Woody's arrival features similar racing tracking shots to the ones Coppola used in Bram Stoker's Dracula - but the style never takes over. This is certainly considerably lighter on its feet than Coppola's very maudlin One From the Heart and much more involving. There's a sense of fun to Finian's Rainbow that doesn't come over in any of his later films, making it surprisingly enjoyable and hard to dislike.The score - How Are Things in Glockamora?, That Old Devil Moon, Something Sort of Grandish and Follow the Rainbow - is better than you remember, boasting some very surreal lyrics, and the script is often genuinely witty and always good natured. The racial satire is  surprisingly deftly handled considering the  similarities to the rather heavy-handed The Watermelon Man: at one point Al Freeman Jr is taught how to shuffle like a black man when employed by the senator (Wynn), who is later turned into a black himself and rejected by his cronies.Of the cast, bad Oirish accents notwithstanding, only Don Francks fails to engage. A colourless leading man with the look of a badly drawn Gene Kelly crossed with Frederic Forrest, he has a strong voice but ultimately lacks the charisma to carry off the romantic lead - and for someone whose great money-making scheme is to grow mentholated tobacco thus condemning a large number of the inhabitants of Rainbow Valley to lung cancer to appeal in this day-and-age, he needs all the charisma he can get.Hermes Pan's choreography is adequate to the occasion but not particularly inspired, especially with Astaire's solos. He is not always helped  by Coppola's direction, which often breaks the action into different settings, making it hard to maintain continuity in a routine. At other times, he shoots the dancers from the waist up, taking too long to pull back for a full body shot to show the whole body at work. However, Something Sort of Grandish, imaginatively and amusingly shot around a washing line, is beautifully handled, and his use of the Scope frame for The Girl I'm Near is flawless.The picture quality is clear and crisp, and the Overture, Intermission and Exit Music have all been retained. Alongside an introduction and commentary by Coppola and the theatrical trailer there's also a half-hour TV broadcast of the film's premiere but not, curiously enough, the short film about the making of the feature that was shot by Coppola's then-prot&eacute;g&eacute;, one George Lucas.",4,Follow the rainbow,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,3260,"['Roguish', 'Irishman', 'Finian', 'McLonergan', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Rainbow', 'Valley', 'Fort', 'Knox', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'test', 'out', 'theory', 'economics', 'plants', 'crock', 'gold', 'stolen', 'leprechauns', 'will', 'grow', 'Unfortunately', 'plans', 'Leprechaun', 'Tommy', 'Steele', 'followed', 'retrieve', 'gold', 'racist', 'senator', 'buy', 'land', 'buried', 'daughter', 'accused', 'witchcraft', 'when', 'ill-advised', 'wish', 'true', 'many', 'roadshow', 'musicals', 'Sixties', 'Finian', 'Rainbow', ""n't"", 'feel', 'overlong', 'overblown', 'being', 'shot', '70mm', 'scale', 'small', 'much', 'charm', 'original', 'show', 'process', 'direction', 'energetic', 'fluid', 'beautiful', 'camerawork', 'odd', 'experimental', 'touches', 'Woody', 'arrival', 'similar', 'racing', 'tracking', 'shots', 'ones', 'Coppola', 'used', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'style', 'never', 'over', 'certainly', 'considerably', 'lighter', 'feet', 'Coppola', 'very', 'maudlin', 'One', 'Heart', 'much', 'more', 'involving', 'sense', 'fun', 'Finian', 'Rainbow', ""n't"", 'come', 'over', 'later', 'films', 'making', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'hard', 'dislike.The', 'score', 'How', 'Are', 'Things', 'Glockamora', 'Old', 'Devil', 'Moon', 'Something', 'Sort', 'Grandish', 'Follow', 'Rainbow', 'better', 'remember', 'boasting', 'very', 'surreal', 'lyrics', 'script', 'often', 'genuinely', 'witty', 'always', 'good', 'natured', 'racial', 'satire', 'surprisingly', 'deftly', 'handled', 'considering', 'similarities', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'Watermelon', 'Man', 'one', 'point', 'Al', 'Freeman', 'Jr', 'taught', 'how', 'shuffle', 'black', 'man', 'when', 'employed', 'senator', 'Wynn', 'who', 'later', 'turned', 'black', 'rejected', 'cronies.Of', 'cast', 'bad', 'Oirish', 'accents', 'notwithstanding', 'only', 'Don', 'Francks', 'engage', 'colourless', 'leading', 'man', 'look', 'badly', 'drawn', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'crossed', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'strong', 'voice', 'ultimately', 'charisma', 'carry', 'off', 'romantic', 'lead', 'someone', 'great', 'money-making', 'scheme', 'grow', 'mentholated', 'tobacco', 'thus', 'condemning', 'large', 'number', 'inhabitants', 'Rainbow', 'Valley', 'lung', 'cancer', 'appeal', 'day-and-age', 'charisma', 'can', 'get.Hermes', 'Pan', 'choreography', 'adequate', 'occasion', 'not', 'particularly', 'inspired', 'especially', 'Astaire', 'solos', 'not', 'always', 'helped', 'Coppola', 'direction', 'often', 'action', 'different', 'settings', 'making', 'hard', 'maintain', 'continuity', 'routine', 'other', 'times', 'shoots', 'dancers', 'waist', 'up', 'taking', 'too', 'long', 'pull', 'back', 'full', 'body', 'shot', 'show', 'whole', 'body', 'work', 'However', 'Something', 'Sort', 'Grandish', 'imaginatively', 'amusingly', 'shot', 'washing', 'line', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'use', 'Scope', 'frame', 'Girl', ""'m"", 'Near', 'flawless.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'clear', 'crisp', 'Overture', 'Intermission', 'Exit', 'Music', 'have', 'been', 'retained', 'introduction', 'commentary', 'Coppola', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'also', 'half-hour', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'film', 'premiere', 'not', 'curiously', 'enough', 'short', 'film', 'making', 'feature', 'was', 'shot', 'Coppola', 'then-prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'one', 'George', 'Lucas']",N/A

Though not an all-time favorite, I do like the score, and I'm a huge Petula Clark fan.  Other video versions I've seen were poor pan-scan versions with horrible color and bad sound.  Warners has done the film justice.  Widescreen, 5.1 Surround and a trip down memory lane with Francis Ford Coppola, the director.An interesting note, this is the first time I am aware of where the lead actress in the film has dubbed the foreign language track.  Petula Clark, being a marvelous singer in several languages, had a huge French-language career going at this time, parallel to her English-language one.  Also being an actress from childhood, she fits perfect as Sharon here.  However, this is the first time I've heard her French vocals of the score, as well as the dialog.  The male leads are other artists (one doing a bad Chevalier for Astaire), but it is definitely Petula in French, as well as the original English soundtrack.  This is an absolute treat and collectible for all Petula fans around the world.Recommended!",5,NICE RESTORATION FOR ASTAIRE'S LAST MUSICAL FILM,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,1094,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'decent', 'print', 'FINIAN', 'RAINBOW', 'sometime', 'not', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'do', 'score', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'fan', 'Other', 'video', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'were', 'poor', 'pan-scan', 'versions', 'horrible', 'color', 'bad', 'sound', 'Warners', 'done', 'film', 'justice', 'Widescreen', '5.1', 'Surround', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'director.An', 'interesting', 'note', 'first', 'time', 'am', 'aware', 'where', 'lead', 'actress', 'film', 'dubbed', 'foreign', 'language', 'track', 'Petula', 'Clark', 'being', 'marvelous', 'singer', 'several', 'languages', 'had', 'huge', 'French-language', 'career', 'going', 'time', 'parallel', 'English-language', 'one', 'Also', 'being', 'actress', 'childhood', 'perfect', 'Sharon', 'here', 'However', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'French', 'vocals', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'dialog', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'other', 'artists', 'one', 'doing', 'bad', 'Chevalier', 'Astaire', 'definitely', 'Petula', 'French', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'English', 'soundtrack', 'absolute', 'treat', 'collectible', 'Petula', 'fans', 'world.Recommended']",N/A
