940784,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BDGW4Y,A Customer,"[1, 1]","Four Brothers begins with a terrible shooting. Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), a dedicated social worker, is shot in a convenience store holdup. The crime seems senseless and inexplicable, but her death brings together the four young boys she adopted when she couldn't place them in any other foster home.Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) Jack (Garrett Hedlund) Angel (Tyrese Gibson) and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) couldn't be more different, but their mother's death devastates them, bringing these ne'er do wells back to snow-covered Detroit. Regardless of their different paths in life they have always considered themselves to be Four Brothers.But perhaps Evelyn's death was not so accidental after all, a closer analysis of the store's videotape makes the crime looks as though it was planned.  Suspicion forces the brothers into a confrontation with a ruthless local crime czar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who specializes in bullying dominance, forcing his subordinates to eat off the floor.The brothers are helped in the search for the killer by a kindly police officer played with panache by Terrance Howard.  But as the clues unravel, the brothers discover shady dealings, criminal manipulation, and police corruption as the four are determined to get to the bottom of the seemingly senseless killing.Four Brothers' strength is its richly varied cast and a story that starts out strong and builds into a tale of vengeance and retaliation. But the film also has a coarse and edgy quality and it manages to convey with a degree of resonance, a world of grit, crooked cops, gang lords, and contract killers who inevitably control the landscape. The tough quartet is often forced into vigilante action in order to see justice done. Bullets and foul language rule as these bad boys seek out and kill other bad boys who just happen to stand in their way.But the ultimate problem with Four Brothers is its overly convoluted plot. I'm still not quite sure who killed Evelyn, why she was killed, and how she was supposedly involved in all the shady dealings. It's as though the director John Singleton loses focus with the story, while attempting to make a violent film appeal to as many people as possible. Despite his best intentions to portray multi-ethnic brotherhood united in affection, he merely ends shooting up Detroit.There's no doubt that Four Brothers is reasonably compelling, and Mark Wahlberg gives one of his edgiest performances in years. The film is also shot during the dead of winter, so it exudes plenty of chills, with Singleton capitalizing on Detroit's reputation as the dangerous gang-ridden heart of urban America. There's a scene involving a car chase in a snowstorm that is particularly gripping.But despite haphazard bursts of ambition, action and drama, Four Brothers ultimately feels like a gangster genre movie, only without the satisfying payoff. The desire for revenge obviously provides these characters with a strong motivation - and you really get the sense that these characters really loved their mother and really love and are totally committed to each other - yet the long-winded plot lets the movie down with a the story doesn't always work things out in a convincing and clear way.

940788,A1VHK9A4VLJTHC,B000BDGW4Y,"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly""","[0, 1]","Mel Gibson's Payback still ranks as my favorite revenge flick, and using that as a standard I can tell you a few things that may bug you about this one.  First having four protagonists won't really work, especially in a two hour time frame, so the film of course centers on one of the brothers (played by Wahlberg).  He is a good actor, and plays the part well, however, having to give up center stage a bit to the three other brothers probably makes the movie weaker, not stronger.Why Payback was such a good flick was the single mindedness of the Gibson character, the syndicate had his money, he wanted it back, and the action of the movie was simply him going after it.  In Four Brothers there is a bit more complication, the problem with that is that the movie was torn being being a detective like ""who done it?"" and a pure action flick.  At one point the brothers say to each other ""we should have been cops"" because they figured out some of the crime so easily.  The problem with that is obvious, when a movie has so many things figured out so easily it loses credibility.Without giving away any spoilers, this flick had way too much in the way of credibility stretching.  Sometimes stuff happens that ""couldn't ever happen"" but when it just piles on and on, it starts to lose its entertainment value.  While the basic story line of this movie is believable most of what happens and how it happens and the ease at which it happens is not believable and unfortunately the main bad guy is made into such a caricature he is totally beyond belief.  And some of the stuff these guys do is simple not plausible.Anyway, all that said, there is still some good entertainment here, a few twists and turns and all that.

940800,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000BDGW4Y,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","This is a highly entertaining film that is well written and directed. I have to admit that I never got ahead of the plot's final ironies which are surprising twists of fate. It is the story of a family of four boys reared by an adopted mother willing to take in rough homeless kids from rough families. Mark Wahlberg is excellent as Bobby Mercer along with his three other adopted brothers played by Andre Benjamin, Garret Hedlund, and Tyrese Gibson. The fact that two of these fellows were white and two were black worked very well in this film where affiliation lines were drawn over many differences and similarities. The family arguments and struggles are very realistic and show how brothers struggle with each other, no matter what race they may be. The brothers are each distinct and unique giving the film further depth. The highest praise I can give is that the bonds between the brothers felt authentic. The city of Detroit is highly visible in the film. After the death of their adopted mother Evelyn, these fellows begin to discover that there may have been more than random crime at work in her death. Terrence Howard is superb as a childhood friend who has become a police officer and is willing to give the brothers some inside information. The puzzle of their mother's death begins to point to a hateful local mobster played perfectly by Chiwetel Ejiofor.

Not to mention these guys never get locked up for their deeds. But that's missing the point.The movie is a mediation on choosing one path over the other. I don't care how well the brothers were brought up, but they are still street kids, with a penchant for violence and they would rightfully want to avenge their mother's death in the only way they know how. This is illustrated with the wonderful talent of Andre Benjamin, who is reluctant to partake in his brothers' violent ways.The film is incredibly entertaining, almost too much so, to the point where there are multiple nonsensical scenes merely for entertainment. But that is all okay! It wasn't supposed to win best picture, and it doesn't play to hollywood like many other films do.The cinematography and locales are superb, and I felt right at home in the blue collar hoods, that actually look similar to what you would find in Denver. The snow really added to the film, and my favorite part was the slippery car chase in a blizzard. Having gone through blizzard after blizzard here in Colorado, I found it very welcoming. And also, many reviewers are saying it was unintentionally funny, when I believe it was intentional. This film is a send up of blaxploitation flicks, a word I have not seen mentioned on this website, and the over the top fight scenes and chase scenes set alongside funk music are meant to inject a certain level of humor.Don't take this film TOO seriously, and you will have a great time.

940803,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000BDGW4Y,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[0, 0]","""Four Brothers"" arrived strong on the scene last year probably because it promotes two things America firmly believes in: family values and violence as a solution to our problems. Vengeance plays a large role in our entertainment because it is something all of us (myself included) and our reptilian brains can understand. Here we watch as four adopted brothers come together in Detroit to avenge the death of their mother. There is no room for nuance here as everything plays out in stark black and white. You see the mother took troubled children off the street, and gave them a home, and then was killed. That means that any means Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and his brothers use are totally justified. Still, for what this film is it is enjoyable. The action sequences are over the top, but still fun. One scene involves a gunfight in broad daylight using high powered automatic weapons, and yet not one pedestrian walks by and the cops show up well after the fact. You may say that it is just portraying typical Detroit, but I lived there for 23 years and I never saw any such thing. After the cops finally do show up, and our titular brothers have blood and death on their hands, but the scene is stripped of any consequence as the cop says all is fine because it was just ""self-defense."" I was reminded of the scene in ""Thank You For Smoking"" in which Rob Lowe's character states that he will explain his characters smoking in outer space to the audience was saying that they invented a ""whatever device.""This film does serve as a male fantasy land. After their mom dies they all move in together and live like slobs. One does have a girlfriend living with them, but she is there pretty much just to cook and get bossed around. When they aren't loafing around like playboys they are plotting the execution of those people who killed their mom. Mark Wahlberg is probably perfectly cast to lead this motley crew as his charisma meshes well with this character. Director John Singleton does have more on his mind than flashy action sequences. The story sets out to tell us that violence only begets more violence, but ""Mystic River"" this ain't. That story takes a few missteps and isn't that tightly wound. Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) is involved in a thread that becomes pivotal at the end, but it isn't given proper face time in the middle. Singleton also does a beautiful job with his cinematography. Never before have I seen the urban decay of Detroit look so majestic. So in the end I will recommend this film, but I do wish that it could have been a little more. The climax has style to spare as Bobby squares off with the town menace on the middle of a frozen lake. I did find it humorous that Bobby was surrounded by an army of his supporters so he really had no chance of losing the fight (if we can call it that, theater is more like it). Since only his pride was on the line it took away from the suspense of the scene. Besides it is not just a movie about fistfights and gunfights. It's about brains winning over brawns. All of the major executions in this film were earned by outsmarting the victim, and that is a healthy lesson for this country. I'd much rather watch this than watch Rambo spray millions of bullets into a crowd of nobodies for no good reason, but that's just me. ***1/4",3,Singleton turns in a Decent Action Flick,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,3297,"['Four', 'Brothers', 'arrived', 'strong', 'scene', 'last', 'year', 'probably', 'two', 'things', 'America', 'firmly', 'family', 'values', 'violence', 'solution', 'problems', 'Vengeance', 'large', 'role', 'entertainment', 'something', 'included', 'reptilian', 'brains', 'can', 'understand', 'Here', 'watch', 'four', 'adopted', 'brothers', 'come', 'together', 'Detroit', 'avenge', 'death', 'mother', 'room', 'nuance', 'here', 'everything', 'out', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'see', 'mother', 'took', 'troubled', 'children', 'street', 'gave', 'home', 'then', 'was', 'killed', 'means', 'Bobby', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'brothers', 'use', 'are', 'totally', 'justified', 'Still', 'what', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'top', 'still', 'fun', 'One', 'scene', 'gunfight', 'broad', 'daylight', 'using', 'high', 'powered', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'yet', 'not', 'one', 'pedestrian', 'walks', 'cops', 'show', 'up', 'well', 'fact', 'may', 'say', 'just', 'portraying', 'typical', 'Detroit', 'lived', '23', 'years', 'never', 'saw', 'such', 'thing', 'cops', 'finally', 'do', 'show', 'up', 'titular', 'brothers', 'have', 'blood', 'death', 'hands', 'scene', 'stripped', 'consequence', 'cop', 'fine', 'was', 'just', 'self-defense', 'was', 'reminded', 'scene', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'character', 'will', 'explain', 'characters', 'smoking', 'outer', 'space', 'audience', 'was', 'saying', 'invented', 'device', 'film', 'serve', 'male', 'fantasy', 'land', 'mom', 'move', 'together', 'live', 'slobs', 'One', 'have', 'girlfriend', 'living', 'there', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'cook', 'get', 'bossed', 'around', 'When', 'are', ""n't"", 'loafing', 'playboys', 'are', 'plotting', 'execution', 'people', 'who', 'killed', 'mom', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'probably', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'lead', 'motley', 'crew', 'charisma', 'meshes', 'well', 'character', 'Director', 'John', 'Singleton', 'have', 'more', 'mind', 'flashy', 'action', 'sequences', 'story', 'out', 'tell', 'violence', 'only', 'more', 'violence', 'Mystic', 'River', 'ai', ""n't"", 'story', 'few', 'missteps', ""n't"", 'tightly', 'wound', 'Jeremiah', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'involved', 'thread', 'pivotal', 'end', ""n't"", 'given', 'proper', 'face', 'time', 'middle', 'Singleton', 'also', 'beautiful', 'job', 'cinematography', 'have', 'seen', 'urban', 'decay', 'Detroit', 'look', 'so', 'majestic', 'So', 'end', 'will', 'recommend', 'film', 'do', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'climax', 'style', 'spare', 'Bobby', 'town', 'menace', 'middle', 'frozen', 'lake', 'did', 'find', 'humorous', 'Bobby', 'was', 'surrounded', 'army', 'supporters', 'so', 'really', 'had', 'chance', 'losing', 'fight', 'can', 'call', 'more', 'only', 'pride', 'was', 'line', 'took', 'away', 'suspense', 'scene', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'fistfights', 'gunfights', 'brains', 'winning', 'brawns', 'major', 'executions', 'film', 'were', 'earned', 'outsmarting', 'victim', 'healthy', 'lesson', 'country', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'watch', 'watch', 'Rambo', 'spray', 'millions', 'bullets', 'crowd', 'nobodies', 'good', 'reason', 'just', '***1/4']",N/A

I'm not a fan of Howard, I don't see what the big attraction is and I was actually happy he only had a few scenes in the film...but other than that my only real complaint is the final showdown between Victor (our villan) and Jerimiah which resembles all too well the ending to Training Day and while Victor was yelling at his former associates all I could see was Denzel screaming ""King Kong aint got $#!+ on me!"" but all in all the movie was an entertaining ride and well worth the price of admition.",4,"Gritty and Real, Four Brothers is better than expected",1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,1884,"['thats', 'what', 'get', 'film', 'something', 'gritty', 'real', 'much', 'better', 'be', 'expected', 'movie', 'four', 'brothers', 'Bobby', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'oldest', 'Angel', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'gangster', 'Jerimiah', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'family', 'man', 'Jack', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'youngest', 'search', 'man', 'men', 'killed', 'mother', 'woman', 'adopted', 'Due', 'boys', 'criminal', 'past', 'Jerimiah', 'police', 'seem', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'off', 'backs', 'Detective', 'Green', 'Howard', 'sympathetic', 'enough', 'partner', 'Fowler', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'up', 'Bobby', 'Angel', 'Jack', 'set', 'off', 'search', 'theirs', 'mothers', 'killer', 'Jerimiah', 'own', 'set', 'demons', 'Following', 'gang', 'member', 'gang', 'member', 'beating', 'few', 'doors', 'killing', 'few', 'thugs', 'three', 'boys', 'err', 'men', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'wished', 'had', ""n't"", 'that', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'incriminate', ""'goody-two-shoes"", 'brother', 'Jerimiah', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'filled', 'action', 'humor', 'entertaining', 'film', 'not', 'oscar', 'film', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'everyone', 'involved', 'more', 'notibly', 'Marky-Mark', 'who', 'excilent', 'job', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'battle', 'fact', 'mother', 'been', 'killed', 'also', 'battle', 'trying', 'protect', 'brothers', 'avenging', 'mother', 'well', 'showing', 'vast', 'ranges', 'emotion', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Howard', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'big', 'attraction', 'was', 'actually', 'happy', 'only', 'had', 'few', 'scenes', 'film', 'other', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'final', 'showdown', 'Victor', 'villan', 'Jerimiah', 'too', 'well', 'ending', 'Training', 'Day', 'Victor', 'was', 'yelling', 'former', 'associates', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'Denzel', 'screaming', 'King', 'Kong', 'aint', 'got', '+', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'well', 'price', 'admition']",N/A

You've got tatted up, gay wannabe rock star Jack ( Garrett Hedlund), former union worker /hellraiser-turned-straight arrow family man Jeremiah (Andre ""3000"" Benjamin), and pretty boy Marine Angel ( Tyrese Gibson), who comes part and parcel with his aggressively dysfunctional relationship with stereotypically hot-blooded Latina girlfriend Sofi (Sofia Vergara). And then there's Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), the oldest, most volatile, charismatically violent leader of the interracial Mercer brethren. Spurred on by the memory of ""the best mother four degenerate bastards could ever have,"" Bobby leads the clan through a messy, hackles-raising, vengeance spree through inner city Detroit, miles ahead of an ineffectual police in trying to solve who murdered their mother.From its snowy, Motown-fueled opening to its frozen lake climax with a nice, unexpectedly pro-union twist, ""Four Brothers"" is a bare-knuckled, take-no-prisoners action romp rooted in gravitas. ""Brothers"" is such a punch-first-ask-questions-almost-never type vehicle, you can credit Singleton for single-handedly resurrecting the urban Western with admirable verve and tenacity. Grounded by a capable script from David Elliot and newcomer Paul Lovett, Singleton's ""Brothers"" is as much about brotherhood (the boys bond through hockey, fighting, Motown music, and general horseplay - all very believable) as it is about bashing some heads in. The hard-edged, potty-mouthed, rough hewn script, matched with Singleton's great visual energy and flair, features surprisingly unexpected violence that keeps the suspense up and lives off balance.Having quite a summer (exec producer and financier of breakout indie hit ""Hustle & Flow""), John Singleton demonstrates just how much he's grown commercially, if not artistically (yes, you CAN do both) in ""Brothers."" Employing the car trick photography acquired through his admittedly sellout vehicle-sequel ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" Singleton spotlights one harrowing, wintry car chase shootout with particularly frenetic magnetism. In a shootout that would make Charlton Heston proud, Singleton stops the film completely by jumpstarting it into the aforementioned urban (Mid-)Western genre, with probably the most exciting and tragic action sequence of the summer. Wracked with high stakes and true emotion yet still viciously edited with hacking, meat cleaver-like intensity, more than bullets and bricks fly in this showdown.Infusing the pic with said intensity is a fine stable of competent and on-the-come-up actors. While singer-cum-actor Tyrese didn't exactly move me in ""2 Fast"" or ""Brothers,"" his Angel at least keeps up with the crew, brooding appropriately for most of the movie yet totally whipped by his bra-popping, hell-on-heels girlfriend. The least developed of the brothers, Hedlund's Jack hints at the corners of an abusive foster home past and an easy acceptance of his role as lowest on the brotherly totem pole, gamely taking ribbing about his dubious sexuality and being stuck with the worst weapons (he gets a crowbar while everyone else gets guns). Despite his native, out-of-place Georgia twang, Andre ""3000"" Benjamin, one-half of worldwide Hip-hop superstar group OutKast, exudes a quiet complexity within his attractive, genial smile as family-and-honor-bound Jeremiah, a smile that hides pain, responsibility, and principle to spare.Mark Wahlberg dives oily-head first into his personally delinquent Beantown past to emerge as Bobby ""the Michigan Mauler"" Mercer, a former high school hockey goon with an appealing, casually violent nature and an affinity for gasoline and firearms. Not just enough to be the leader of this ragamuffin crew of not quite reformed malcontents, Wahlberg's Bobby leads by beautifully misguided, hotheaded example, more than happy to create a scene with mack truck finesse where surgeon scalpel precision would do. In other words, he's so unpredictable, you can't take your eyes off him, for fear you miss his next ferocious, out-of-his-hindquarters move.Whereas the chemistry among all four brothers is believably tight, the support suffers in comparison, despite amiable casting. As an ear-to-the-streets detective, Terrence Howard does Terrence Howard, emitting his trademark, green-eyed laser beam concentration in his handful of scenes. Also from ""Hustle & Flow"" as well as Singleton's confused, patchwork quilt of black male psychology ""Baby Boy,"" Taraji P. Henson is criminally underused as Jeremiah's worrisome wife Camille (but I'm sure the seldom-working Henson appreciated the check). Having heralded him the British heir apparent to Denzel upon introduction to his work in ""Dirty Pretty Things,"" Chiwetel Ejiofor shocked the hell out of me by washing up with a sturdy, American hood accent as gang lord Victor Sweet. A sort of Nino Brown-lite, Ejiofor's Sweet is cartoonishly malevolent, who prefers as much to punish with brute force as with unforgettable humiliation. The only one out of place at this party is Josh Charles (S.W.A.T.), a bland and curious choice for a Detroit detective, standing out like Tom Cruise at a Nation of Islam meeting (or the BET Awards - same difference).Hampered but never slowed by moments of unintentional comedy that usually sprout from random violence and insults, this movie may get a little silly with all the action but at least it's never boring. Deploying an intriguing second act complication that blurs the lines between good guys and bad, ""Four Brothers"" is a multi-culti cowboy flick for the 21st century. Somewhere in his grave, Charles Bronson is giving Singleton a pistol-packing salute.",4,Four Brothers (DVD),1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,5823,"['heels', 'convenience', 'store', 'slaying',

940817,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000BDGW4Y,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[1, 1]","""Four Brothers"" is not just an action movie. It's much more. It is a thriller, a domestic drama, a dark comedy, and a somewhat correct social commentary on our lives today and how everything can spin out of control very quickly. The beginning of the movie suggests that it may be just a formulaic action movie with endless shootouts and fight scenes and little plot. As the opening scene goes: A woman drives to a conveniance store, gets out of her car, finds a child in the store stealing candy, repremands him, and then goes to look at Thanksgiving turkeys. Then, two masked robbers come in, take the money, and execute the stores owner and the woman. Now, the scene is obviously done deliberately cheesy (the store owners body jerks before the gunshot, and the blood takes all of three seconds to appear on his shirt) so you may think the rest of the movie will be that way. But it's not. It is homage to seventies revenge and exploitation movies like ""Foxy Brown"". In doing the film this way director John Singleton gives himself some leeway and makes it obvious that if we take this darkly comic movie seriously, that we might as well leave the theater now. Case in point: A sequence in which thugs invade the Mercer home and shoot up the house from the outside is completely implausible but alot of fun. They all shoot it out for a while, then one of the thugs discovers that one of the brothers is hiding behind a brick partition in the house and then proceeds to shoot it up. I need not tell you how implausible this is. The rest of the movie pretty much rests on the fact that, no matter how implausible, the action is going to keep audiences enthralled. Most of the movie (the first hour) are mostly spent on how the brothers cope with their mothers death, how they decide to get revenge, and how they go about it. They interview people, and at one point when a man won't tell them what they want to hear, they give him a compund fracture. The last forty or so minutes of the movie is spent on a lengthy shootout, plot twists and a climax so entertainingly over-the-top it gives ""Kill Bill"" a run for its blood-money. In the first half the action is kept to a bare minimum. There are scenes of violence in the interogations, and there is a spectacular car chase through downtown detroit in a blizzard that is one of the best action set pieces in recent memory. The down-time works in favor of the movie and helps set the mood just the right way.When Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) is killed in a seemingly random store stick up, the Mercer boys: Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Jack (Garrett Hedlund), Angel (Tyrese Gibson) and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) come back to their Detroit home for her funeral and a little well-earned vengeance. All of them were adopted by Evelyn, a social worker, and all of them were lost causes. The four go about getting their revenge, and each person leads them deeper into the mob. Two cops, Green (Terrence Howard of ""Crash"" and ""Hustle And Flow"") and Fowler (Josh Charles the crooked cop from ""SWAT"") advise the boys to stay out of the case and let them handle it. Of course, the warning is not heeded, and the boys shoot ans stab their way to the truth. Eventually they are led to Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor from ""Love, Actually"" and ""Dirty Pretty Things""), a vicous fur coat clad mobster and pretty much the leader of Detroit. Even high powered government officials are just ""gangsters in suits and high positions"". Sweet is so vicous that he, before killing a high powered government official in his childrens play area, he makes an associate and his girlfriend eat off the floor like dogs.Ejiofor has previously played good and likeable characters in his movies. He usually plays the hero (""Things""), the love interest (""Love, Actually"") and most recently the musician in ""Melinda And Melinda"". Here he plays such a dispicable and unlikeable man that the entire time he is on screen (a suprisingly stark two scenes and about seven minutes screen time total) the audience wishes the worst for him. Turning in another good performance is Wahlberg who shows that he may now be a full-fledged actor and not just an action hero. Andre Benjamin, who was so funny in ""Be Cool"" is given a more supporting role here, but he makes up for his lack of screen time with a very important part in the climax. ""Four Brothers"" is a very good movie. It would be hard to find something wrong with it. It is simply a very well-done movie that has equal amounts drama and action and violence. There should be more action-revenge movies like this one here.Running Time: 1 Hour 49 Minutes (109 Minutes)Rated R For Strong Violence (Several shootouts, a car chase, bloodier, more stated shootings

Wahlberg was good in the role of the oldest son, as were the other ""sons"", but the story was confused and confusing, I never really felt the pull of the mother (and I generally am a fan of Fionulla Flanagan), and I found myself losing interest in the whole thing midway through.  The basic premise of the story is one that should keep your attention--4 sons avenging the murder of their adoptive mother--but the plot twists were violent without being compelling,they were hard to follow at times, and they didn't always make a lot of sense even when you could follow them.  The scenes of Detroit were suitably gritty and depressing but didn't seem to relate to the brothers, who didn't seem to relate all that well to each other.

This may be do to his character design, given the fact that he was the ""baby"" amongst the four brothers, however he just didn't shine like the rest.All in all, and quite honestly I would have never have chosen to watch this film, if it weren't for a friend who threw it in with a handful of films to borrow.

The film has several of those irritating film cliches that mademe finally want to reach for the fast-forward button: 1) four guys who are basically nice guys (they're nice to kids, they play hockey,they tease each other in a friendly way, they're sentimental about mom) and they also are really really good when it comes to handling guns and getting rough with some bad guys 2)several shoot-outs with the bad guys 2)a car chase with the bad guys (although I do love good car chases in movies, so this cliche is OK) 3)irritating 2 dimensional girlfriends/wives who supposedly add a bit of humor to the film, but don't, because what they do and say are weak attempts at humor, making them just cartoon-like characters in a film 4)two-dimensional bad guys - they look mean, they sneer, etc. If a script is good, and if the dialog is clever, it can be a good action film even with these cliches. The humorous dialog between the characters in this film is pretty weak, though. Another film cliche is to show a ""light scene"" (with some more weak humor) showing the basic niceness of the characters right after they have roughed up some bad guys or blown someone away. The light touches aren't convincing, and again, the humor and the dialog are pretty weak. I do like a good action film with bad guys in it, and with at least one good car chase, but I really thought this film was a waste of time.

She was shot in what seemed a random robbery-gone-wrong in a convenient store. There were four brothers even though they did not resemble each other a bit. All four were adopted by a murdered woman many years ago when she was a social worker and tried to find new homes for the children from dysfunctional families. Nobody wanted those four. She did. She took them in, brought them up, gave them love and support and they called her mom and themselves - brothers. Now she is dead, and the brothers start their own investigation on the dirty and often deadly streets of their childhood city to find those who were behind the murder. Very soon they discover that the robbery was a cover up for a hit murder. Someone wanted their mother dead and paid for her murder. Four brothers Mercer, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), the leader, the oldest, toughest, short- tempered, and stubborn; Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), the only family man of four who had taken care of the mother the last years; Angel (Tyres Gibson), the sexy one, and Jack (Garrett Hedlund), the youngest, whom three older brothers try to protect, are determined to avenge their mother's death no matter what it would cost. The film was directed by John Singleton as an urban thriller -revenge movie which is also a family drama, and I like it very much. It is violent, gritty, it moves well, it's got many plot turns on its way, it is packed with very effective dynamic action scenes, and acting is very good by all principal players. I was especially impressed by Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn as Victor Sweet, the pure evil despite his name. Ejifor said once, ""I like to disappear into a role. I equate the success of it with a feeling of being chemically changed"". The actor whom I first noticed in a compelling role of an illegal immigrant in London in the film Dirty Pretty Things (2002), was frightening in Four Brothers. I am also becoming a fan of Mark Wahlberg. He's got charisma and screen presence. The film does not fail to provide some humor, to show how much the four brothers mean to one another, and what the woman whom they lost meant to them. I missed the movie when it was released and actually did not know anything about it until this evening when its opening scene grabbed my attention; I began watching and did not leave until the credits started rolling.A bit of trivia: John Singleton is the youngest Oscar nominated director.

940833,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BDGW4Y,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","John Singleton has a gift for depicting the gritty side of life and making it credible: there are reasons for heads-up defensive action in neighborhoods where perpetrators and victims live side by side in a world teetering on imbalance.FOUR BROTHERS is a finely tuned, taut little film that demonstrates the influence of a caring adult on kids with little future can impact lives.  Evelyn Mercer (a terrific Fionnula Flanagan) is a single woman who adopted four orphans as children and raised them tightly bonded brothers: two are white (ex-con Bobby - Mark Wahlberg - and gay musician Jack - Garrett Hedlund: two are African American - (gentle Angel - Tyrese Gibson - and stay-at-home businessman Jeremiah - Andr&eacute; Benjamin).  The four brothers reunite when their mother is killed during a store holdup.  Knowing that the Detroit police are a corrupt organization they take matters into their own hands, seeking out their mother's killers.  Along the way they discover aspects of each other that draw them eventually even closer as brothers.The cast is excellent with fine cameo performances from Terrence Howard and Josh Charles as polar opposite policemen, from Flanagan (who though murdered in the first frames of the film reappears to 'spiritually' influence the brothers), Chiwetel Ejiofor as the bad guy, Taraji P. Henson as Jeremiah's wife and Sof&iacute;a Vergara as Angel's girlfriend.  The story is solid if a bit predictable, but the messages are many about racism, brotherhood, family importance, and awareness of police corruption.  Singleton directs with breakneck speed yet allows us time to get to know everyone in the story.  This is a dandy action film with a heart.

940838,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B000BDGW4Y,Isaac,"[0, 0]","There is a memorable scene early on in ""Four Brothers."" The title characters, foster brothers, two white, two black, sit at Thanksgiving dinner in the house that they grew up in together. Its the first time in a number of years they have seen one another. Their foster mother, Evelyn (Fionnula Flangdon), sits at the table with them and reminds them to chew with their mouths closed, to keep their elbows off the table, and to let go of their abusive early childhoods. Evelyn has been murdered in cold blood, and the men remember her loving instructions as they eat. The four brothers have come home to Detroit to bury their mother...and those responsible for her death.John Singleton's new film is one of oblique craftsmanship, held together by four very effective lead performances and connecting on levels that are not only cognizant to the story, but on totally different planes. As an action-thriller, it works. As a characterized drama, it works. As a tale of formulated vengeance, it works. As a compilation of appropriated comedy relief, it works. As an excursion from mediocre and similar films such as ""A Man Apart,"" ""Man on Fire,"" and ""The Punisher,"" it works.Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) is the eldest of the four, a determined and natural born leader. Jeremiah Mercer (Andr&eacute; Benjamin) is a wealthy family man, living with his wife and two daughters. Angel Mercer (Tyrese Gibson) is a hustler, almost itching to get back in trouble. The baby of the family is ""Cracker"" Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund), an aspiring punk rock artist. They were all lost causes when they were youths, and Evelyn, who had been a foster mother all her life, was unable to find homes for them. So she raised them especially as her own.Evelyn was gunned down by a pair of alleged gang-bangers during a convenience store robbery. We know that things are not what they seem when the four brothers set up their own investigation and learn of a particular witness being paid to keep his mouth shut. It appears as if Evelyn's murder was of great cause, and the film contains a development that hints at a guilty party within the four brothers.There is eventually an investigation set up by partners Lieutenant Green (Terrance Howard) and Detective Fowler (Josh Charles). And then there's the matter of Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a vicious crime lord who owns half of the Detroit police force. The film lingers on the transparent mystery of the police and the mob so effectively that when a result is brought forth on the matter, it actually catches you by surprise. And effective, too, is the Singleton's use of gritty atmosphere, with the actual mean streets of Detroit providing a lethal adversary for the Mercer brothers as they undergo their journey of redemption.""Four Brothers"" is deceptively routine. By the time we learn the motives of the characters and the inevitable twists in the plot, we can basically sit back and watch it unfold, confirming our predictions along the way. We know, for an example, that crooked cops can not be honest, even with each other, and that when you have $400,000, you can convince some pretty tough people to do your bidding. Also, during a prolonged shootout in broad daylight, you can gun down a bunch of bad guys in ""self-defense"" without having to give the police a reasonable explanation as to why they wanted you dead.However damaging these and a few other items may be, John Singleton orchestrates a film that is affluent with kinetic flare. But even then, as well made as it is, shouldn't there have been something more redeeming about the story? It would have been amazing if Evelyn's murder had been strictly gang-related and not of a higher order. This way, the Mercer brothers would have done battle with the destinies that Evelyn helped them escape.I guess that when a movie is done right on its own terms, that when it is focused on momentary surprises, it probably gets the job done whether or not it produces any irony. ""Four Brothers"" is not a film to be studied or criticized based on what it should have done. It should be criticized on the fact that it gives us the blessed assurance that it is not typical, when in reality it is. If you were to consider, for a moment, how far this category of action movies has come over the past few years, you would be surprised to note that this movie is one of the strongest in the genre. I have already mentioned three of the weaker ones. - IsaacRated R; 108 minutes; Directed by John Singleton",4,Four Brothers,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,4488,"['memorable', 'scene', 'early', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'title', 'characters', 'foster', 'brothers', 'two', 'white', 'two', 'black', 'sit', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'house', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'number', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'foster', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'Fionnula', 'Flangdon', 'table', 'chew', 'mouths', 'closed', 'keep', 'elbows', 'table', 'let', 'go', 'abusive', 'early', 'childhoods', 'Evelyn', 'been', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'men', 'remember', 'loving', 'instructions', 'eat', 'four', 'brothers', 'have', 'come', 'home', 'Detroit', 'bury', 'mother', 'responsible', 'death.John', 'Singleton', 'new', 'film', 'one', 'oblique', 'craftsmanship', 'held', 'together', 'four', 'very', 'effective', 'lead', 'performances', 'connecting', 'levels', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'cognizant', 'story', 'totally', 'different', 'planes', 'action-thriller', 'characterized', 'drama', 'tale', 'formulated', 'vengeance', 'compilation', 'appropriated', 'comedy', 'relief', 'excursion', 'mediocre', 'similar', 'films', 'such', 'A', 'Man', 'Apart', 'Man', 'Fire', 'Punisher', 'Mercer', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'eldest', 'four', 'determined', 'natural', 'born', 'leader', 'Jeremiah', 'Mercer', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Benjamin', 'wealthy', 'family', 'man', 'living', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'Angel', 'Mercer', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'hustler', 'almost', 'itching', 'get', 'back', 'trouble', 'baby', 'family', 'Cracker', 'Jack', 'Mercer', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'aspiring', 'punk', 'rock', 'artist', 'were', 'lost', 'causes', 'when', 'were', 'youths', 'Evelyn', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'foster', 'mother', 'life', 'was', 'unable', 'find', 'homes', 'raised', 'especially', 'own.Evelyn', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'pair', 'alleged', 'gang-bangers', 'convenience', 'store', 'robbery', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'when', 'four', 'brothers', 'set', 'up', 'own', 'investigation', 'learn', 'particular', 'witness', 'being', 'paid', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'Evelyn', 'murder', 'was', 'great', 'cause', 'film', 'development', 'hints', 'guilty', 'party', 'four', 'brothers.There', 'eventually', 'investigation', 'set', 'up', 'partners', 'Lieutenant', 'Green', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'Detective', 'Fowler', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'then', 'matter', 'Victor', 'Sweet', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'vicious', 'crime', 'lord', 'who', 'half', 'Detroit', 'police', 'force', 'film', 'lingers', 'transparent', 'mystery', 'police', 'mob', 'so', 'effectively', 'when', 'result', 'brought', 'forth', 'matter', 'actually', 'surprise', 'effective', 'too', 'Singleton', 'use', 'gritty', 'atmosphere', 'actual', 'mean', 'streets', 'Detroit', 'providing', 'lethal', 'adversary', 'Mercer', 'brothers', 'undergo', 'journey', 'redemption', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'deceptively', 'routine', 'time', 'learn', 'motives', 'characters', 'inevitable', 'twists', 'plot', 'can', 'basically', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'unfold', 'confirming', 'predictions', 'way', 'know', 'example', 'crooked', 'cops', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'honest', 'even', 'other', 'when', 'have', '400,000', 'can', 'convince', 'pretty', 'tough', 'people', 'do', 'bidding', 'Also', 'prolonged', 'shootout', 'broad', 'daylight', 'can', 'gun', 'down', 'bunch', 'bad', 'guys', 'self-defense', 'having', 'give', 'police', 'reasonable', 'explanation', 'why', 'wanted', 'dead.However', 'damaging', 'few', 'other', 'items', 'may', 'be', 'John', 'Singleton', 'film', 'affluent', 'kinetic', 'flare', 'even', 'then', 'well', 'made', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'something', 'more', 'redeeming', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'Evelyn', 'murder', 'had', 'been', 'strictly', 'gang-related', 'not', 'higher', 'order', 'way', 'Mercer', 'brothers', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'battle', 'destinies', 'Evelyn', 'helped', 'escape.I', 'guess', 'when', 'movie', 'done', 'right', 'own', 'terms', 'when', 'focused', 'momentary', 'surprises', 'probably', 'job', 'done', 'not', 'irony', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'studied', 'criticized', 'based', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'should', 'be', 'criticized', 'fact', 'blessed', 'assurance', 'not', 'typical', 'when', 'reality', 'were', 'consider', 'moment', 'how', 'far', 'category', 'action', 'movies', 'come', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'note', 'movie', 'one', 'strongest', 'genre', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'three', 'weaker', 'ones', 'IsaacRated', 'R', '108', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'John', 'Singleton']",N/A

The four brothers--bound by love--rather than blood, show us that emotional bonds can reach a cosmic level, overshadowing the mundane, anemic relationships of so-caled family films and romantic films that fill the large screen and the boob tube. In this regard, the characters are 'larger than life' as was Macbeth or Oedipus, and their fate and motivations are beyond the pale of the everyday,while the extremes of emotion complement the extremes of what is at stake, but isn't that why we go to most movies in the first place? This film portrays four warriors--each with a flaw, one is belligerant; another is at the beck & call of his Latina girlfriend; another is a hip but physically fragile local rock musician (and gay)and a bit out of place in this rough, corrupt world; another strives to make it in the world of affluence, only to find its corruption is as nefarious as life on the street--yet all who manage to create a synergy through their love for one another that is able to overcome the world of corruption of Detroit underworld (Hades)they are forced to confront over the murder of their ""earth mother/foster mother."" There's violence in the film; but there's just as much if not more in Shakespeare or Greek drama.  Unlike those earlier versions, the familial loyalty to one another is what counts and color, class, sexual preference are shown to be irrelevant when the ties that bind are true.  The dialogue is clever and crisp, and has that rare combination of being artifice, with the feel of a poetry slam while accurately imitating 'real' street talk  The action is as riveting as the banter, and although there is one 'required' blaze of gunfire scene that could have been toned down a bit, the film is faithful to the roots of tragedy--albeit here the characters are imperfect gods of the neighborhood rather than of Olympus. One would be hesitant to say a revenge film promotes family values, but the respect these four very different personalities have for one another--despite their human shortcomings--is a lesson many Americans should take to heart. And I sure hope nobody complains that the 'brother in charge' is white because of caucasian control of the media; the director/writer is John Singleton.",5,"Over the top, but so was Shakespeare and Sophocles",1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,2680,"['Four', 'Brothers', 'actually', 'stepbrothers', 'two', 'white', 'two', 'black', 'acted', 'masterfully', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'great', 'revenge', 'movie', 'intricacies', 'plot', 'characters', 'lie', 'primal', 'emotions', 'often', 'lambasted', 'movie', 'critics', ""'independent"", 'film', 'aficianados', 'stuff', 'opera', 'ballet', 'other', 'art', 'forms', 'go', 'raw', 'unabashed', 'unapologetic', 'emotional', 'classics', 'four', 'brothers', 'bound', 'love', 'rather', 'blood', 'show', 'emotional', 'bonds', 'can', 'reach', 'cosmic', 'level', 'overshadowing', 'mundane', 'anemic', 'relationships', 'so-caled', 'family', 'films', 'romantic', 'films', 'fill', 'large', 'screen', 'boob', 'tube', 'regard', 'characters', 'are', ""'larger"", 'life', 'was', 'Macbeth', 'Oedipus', 'fate', 'motivations', 'are', 'pale', 'everyday', 'extremes', 'emotion', 'complement', 'extremes', 'what', 'stake', ""n't"", 'that', 'why', 'go', 'most', 'movies', 'first', 'place', 'film', 'four', 'warriors', 'flaw', 'one', 'belligerant', 'beck', 'call', 'Latina', 'girlfriend', 'hip', 'physically', 'fragile', 'local', 'rock', 'musician', 'gay', 'bit', 'place', 'rough', 'corrupt', 'world', 'make', 'world', 'affluence', 'only', 'find', 'corruption', 'as', 'nefarious', 'life', 'street', 'yet', 'who', 'manage', 'create', 'synergy', 'love', 'one', 'able', 'overcome', 'world', 'corruption', 'Detroit', 'underworld', 'Hades', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'murder', 'earth', 'mother/foster', 'mother', 'violence', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'Shakespeare', 'Greek', 'drama', 'earlier', 'versions', 'familial', 'loyalty', 'one', 'what', 'color', 'class', 'sexual', 'preference', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'irrelevant', 'when', 'ties', 'bind', 'are', 'true', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'crisp', 'rare', 'combination', 'being', 'artifice', 'feel', 'poetry', 'slam', 'accurately', 'imitating', 'street', 'action', 'as', 'riveting', 'banter', 'one', ""'required"", 'blaze', 'gunfire', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'bit', 'film', 'faithful', 'roots', 'tragedy', 'here', 'characters', 'are', 'imperfect', 'gods', 'neighborhood', 'rather', 'Olympus', 'One', 'would', 'be', 'hesitant', 'say', 'revenge', 'film', 'promotes', 'family', 'values', 'respect', 'four', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'have', 'one', 'human', 'shortcomings', 'lesson', 'many', 'Americans', 'should', 'take', 'heart', 'sure', 'hope', 'nobody', ""'brother"", 'charge', 'white', 'caucasian', 'control', 'media', 'director/writer', 'John', 'Singleton']",N/A
940840,ANYDF6GKK7PA4,B000BDGW4Y,"Jackson Zhou ""The Craftsman""","[12, 23]","I had an idea what this movie was about before I saw it, which was the story of four brothers seeking revenge for the death of their beloved mother as a result of a criminal act.  The problem is, that's all this movie has, just an idea.  Other than the premise of explaining what had brought the four youngsters back into Detroit and the tragedy that drives them to do what they do, the rest of the movie pretty much makes no sense.As you trace the footsteps of the four brothers around town in their investigation, you're left with nothing but pointless beatings and killings.  The main characters would basically find a lead, and when they find the lead, without even any systematic questioning of the suspect or ascertaining their involvement, or how they were involved with their mother's death, they either kill them or beat them up really badly.  It basically goes something like this, ""Give me a name!"", ""Umm, Smith."", and BAM, they kill you, and moves onto do the same thing to Smith.  This type of storytelling gets to be frustrating for the audience because just when you think you're about to get a clue to what the story is about, the characters snuffs it out.  After this repeats itself throughout the rest of the movie, I got the sense that the writers of this film never really knew what the story was about themselves, and might have been too lazy to come up with one, therefore their solution was to hide their incompetence by building the film on a pattern of offering haphazard characters as clues and then immediately eliminating them from the story.  And apparently director John Singleton was also too lazy to question the flimsy basis of the script.The only thing that show some promise was the cast.  And characters played by Mark Wahlberg and Garret Hedlund had some potentials.  Too bad they were given such a poor script and characters to work with.

This is easily one of the worst big studio films I have seen in the past 5 years.  The storyline is ludicrous, the characters are walking cliches and completely unbelievable.  The screenplay is obscenely bad.  Wahlberg, whom I will openly admit is not my favorite actor, turns in a less than stellar performance even for him.It occurred to me while watching this film, that the ""four brothers"" and accompanying story must have been created from some do-it-yourself movie kit.  Attach a big name director, an actor with box office draw, add water and ta-daa!!! A blockbuster, right?  WRONG.The plot follows no logical path whatsoever, frequently derailing any momentum the film might develop with scene choices that can only be described as ponderous.  What exactly was the point of the restaurant scene where the gangster and his ho ate off the floor, anyway?I know camp when I see it.  I know a western in sheeps clothing when I see it.  I'm not buying the explanation that Four Brothers is some kind of modern western in sheeps clothing or a traditional morality tale of some sort.  There's no hidden art here.  Just garbage.  I can only assume that people gave this movie the benefit of the doubt becaue the director is John Singleton of Boyz N' the Hood/Hustle & Flow fame.  I am well aware that I'm in the minority on reviews for this film.  So I'll sum up by saying, if you're easily entertained and expect little in the way of movie entertainment, perhaps you'll find Four Brothers a nice way to kill an hour and 45 minutes.

""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","I wasn't expecting much on this movie, I mean it does have Marky Mark in it and I'd hate to think he's be the start of the movie. But I was hoping for it to be exciting, emotional, and engaging... And surprisingly it was.Mark Walbergh, Garrett Hedlund, Andre 3000, and Tyrese Gibson play the four brothers very well as delinquent,....... but there were many simple one-liners and Mark Wahlberg seems to play the same character way too often. Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way. He is definitely much better actor than rapper. I thought Garrett Hedlund done well here. He is the youngest of the group, who's a "" 3rd type rocker"",is very naive. He's very protected by his brother Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and it makes him be the most sensitive of them all. Tyrese Gibson, as Angel and stay-at-home businessman Jeremiah played by Andr&eacute; Benjamin done favorable well. The remaining cast done a great job with fine cameo performances from Terrence Howard and Josh Charles as polar opposite policemen, from Flanagan (who though murdered in the first frames of the film reappears to 'spiritually' influence the brothers), Chiwetel Ejiofor as the bad guy, Tara P. Henson as Jeremiah's wife and Sof&iacute;a Vergara as Angel's girlfriend. The story is solid if a bit predictable, but the messages are many about racism, brotherhood, family importance, and awareness of police corruption.One of the things this movie does best is show the love and commitment between the brothers. Again the chemistry between the actors were excellent and added a pleasant feel to the film. They also led to many very funny comic moments, which I did not expect to see as many as I did. I laughed many times. Singleton might be a better writer than director, but he does a good job through out. Most of the film is simple camera angles and what not, but there were a few moments, specifically a car chase, that was shot really well. It was all done in a manor that kept it realistic while keeping it interesting. It should also be noted that this movie had the SECOND most intense shoot out I've ever seen in a movie. Second only to, of course, the LA streets shoot out in ""Heat"" which, in my opinion, is the most intense 15 minutes ever filmed.I will also like to add that some of the dialogue is raw but hey, this is Detroit City and Bobby Mercer only asks questions ""once.""

With ""Four Brothers"", director John Singleton (2000's ""Shaft"" remake) takes this mantra to the extreme, showing that no matter what, when the chips are down you can always count on your family to watch your back.After their saintly foster mother (Fionnula Flanagan) is murdered in a convenience store, her adopted sons, two white and two black, come home to pay their respects.  Three out of the four brothers, Jack (Garrett Hedlund), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), are content to believe that what happened was just a case of wrong place/wrong time.  However, oldest brother Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) believes that they should at least try to find who did this, and deliver some punishment.  In their search for answers, the brothers discover that their mom was not just a random killing, but a planned execution that is tied into a vast conspiracy ranging from the Detroit police, to city council, to a local drug kingpin.  Now, the brothers are in a fight to not only bring down those responsible, but also walk away  with their lives intact.The gritty, hard edged violence of ""Four Brothers"" gives the movie a modern urban western tone, that is nicely balanced by the brothers' bond to one and other.  John Singleton was careful to show that though the oldest brother, Bobby, was hot-headed and wanted vengeance on the killers, words of wisdom from his other brothers prevailed.  Causing him to stay his hand, until all responsible were discovered, and the conspiracy revealed.  A well-written story that takes time to allow the audience connect with the brothers, and feel their deep pain, before engaging in the revenge arc of the story.  This was key, so that the audience wouldn't view the brothers deeds as no better than those responsible for their mother's death.  All of the actors in ""Four Brothers"" were outstanding, one character I wish they would have developed a little more was that of Detective Green (Terrence Howard), an uncorruptable Detroit police officer, who knows that the brothers are planning vengeance, but is torn between his duty as a cop and his duty as a friend of the family.  The action scenes are fast, intense, and in some cases brutal, but never gratuitous, with only minimal amounts of blood and gore shown.With its focus on strong family bonds, and a think before you shoot mentality, ""Four Brothers"" rises above your average revenge movie, and is a thoroughly entertaining and engaging film that most people will enjoy.""Four Brothers"" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality.",5,Vengeance Will Be Theirs...,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,2670,"['Never', 'underestimate', 'bonds', 'family', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'tagline', 'terrific', 'revenge/murder', 'mystery', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'director', 'John', 'Singleton', '2000', 'Shaft', 'remake', 'mantra', 'extreme', 'showing', 'matter', 'what', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'can', 'always', 'count', 'family', 'watch', 'back.After', 'saintly', 'foster', 'mother', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'murdered', 'convenience', 'store', 'adopted', 'sons', 'two', 'white', 'two', 'black', 'come', 'home', 'pay', 'respects', 'Three', 'four', 'brothers', 'Jack', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Angel', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'Jeremiah', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'are', 'content', 'believe', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'just', 'case', 'wrong', 'place/wrong', 'time', 'However', 'oldest', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'should', 'least', 'try', 'find', 'who', 'did', 'deliver', 'punishment', 'search', 'answers', 'brothers', 'discover', 'mom', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'random', 'killing', 'planned', 'execution', 'tied', 'vast', 'conspiracy', 'ranging', 'Detroit', 'police', 'city', 'council', 'local', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Now', 'brothers', 'are', 'fight', 'not', 'only', 'bring', 'down', 'responsible', 'also', 'walk', 'away', 'lives', 'intact.The', 'gritty', 'hard', 'edged', 'violence', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'modern', 'urban', 'western', 'tone', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'brothers', 'bond', 'one', 'other', 'John', 'Singleton', 'was', 'careful', 'show', 'oldest', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'was', 'hot-headed', 'wanted', 'vengeance', 'killers', 'words', 'wisdom', 'other', 'brothers', 'prevailed', 'Causing', 'stay', 'hand', 'responsible', 'were', 'discovered', 'conspiracy', 'revealed', 'well-written', 'story', 'time', 'allow', 'audience', 'connect', 'brothers', 'feel', 'deep', 'pain', 'engaging', 'revenge', 'arc', 'story', 'was', 'key', 'audience', 'would', ""n't"", 'view', 'brothers', 'deeds', 'better', 'responsible', 'mother', 'death', 'actors', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'were', 'outstanding', 'one', 'character', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'little', 'more', 'was', 'Detective', 'Green', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'uncorruptable', 'Detroit', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'brothers', 'are', 'planning', 'vengeance', 'torn', 'duty', 'cop', 'duty', 'friend', 'family', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fast', 'intense', 'cases', 'brutal', 'never', 'gratuitous', 'only', 'minimal', 'amounts', 'blood', 'gore', 'shown.With', 'focus', 'strong', 'family', 'bonds', 'think', 'shoot', 'mentality', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'rises', 'average', 'revenge', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'sensuality']",N/A

I will start with what I liked about the film.  It was nice to see a film about a mother who takes in 4 boys of different ethnicities and makes them a family.  That was beautiful to see in a film.  It was nice to see these men who didn't necessarily grow up to be perfect but nonetheless their bond remained.  This is something that I like about the film quite a bit.What I felt was lacking or what didn't work for me was the revenge part of the film.  It didn't seem to make much sense.  I understand that the mother was senselessly killed but really, didn't she she show them a home and heart where they could feel safe.  Here are 4 men who will remember table manners that their murdered mom taught them yet they seem hellbent on revenging her death.  Like this will bring her back.  If they had had any respect for her, they would have taken the higher road but in this film, it seems that revenge is the higher road.  It simply didn't fit the story.  The film seems to flat out endorse and glorify revenging the wrong that has been done to you and sadly so the brothers do so through killing people.  If anything I lost all respect for the brothers by the end of the film.  These brothers aren't real men, these are cowards who had a gem of a mother who squandered it all.I was flat out surprised that at the end credits, John Singleton's name was shown as the director.  I couldn't believe it.

Set off by the police force's lack of effort (in their eyes) in finding their adoptive mother's killer, the four brothers take vigilante justice to a whole new level. Nearly lost in the plot of killing, corruption and revenge though is a story about family, loyalty and love, even respect (for the woman who raised them mostly). I was touched by their Thanksgiving meal where they each saw her, except Bobby, who finally saw her at the end. Josh Charles plays another smarmy, dirty cop (like he did in SWAT) and Garrett Hedlund does an amazing job as the troubled, youngest brother who tries so hard to make the older ones proud.

940857,A2ICI500LRO01K,B000BDGW4Y,Kyle Wells,"[0, 0]","""Four Brothers"" is successful as an action film because it accepts its role as an action film. Too many `entertainment' movies lately are trying to be something more and in the process end up being substantially less. I have no problem with experimentation within a genre, but when so much of that experimentation fails it becomes the films that stick to the basics and do them justice that become rewarding. ""Four Brothers"" is just such a film. It is not perfect by any means, and at times falls hopelessly into the traps I have mentioned, but when it sticks to what it does best it works better than any action films I have seen in a while. John Singleton finds a pace and a tone that drives and heightens the story and characters and in doing so helps a film that could have been so drearily standard become something substantially more. Rather than mere dull formula or misguided wandering, the film achieves a level of lively entertainment, something which Hollywood as of late has been having trouble delivering.So what makes ""Four Brothers"" different? First of all the story is simple enough that it more often then not does bog down the pace of the film. This is not always true and there is certainly a mid-film lull when various uninteresting plot twists and revelations hold back the good old-fashioned a@# kickings, but for the majority of the movie the plot is used to progress, rather than hold back the action. Plus, nothing works better for an unapologetically violent and exuberant action movie than a story of vengeance, and ""Four Brothers"" is best when not trying to make any claims to the contrary. The acting suits the film also, especially Mark Wahlberg, who I often enjoy and who here is obviously enjoying himself, playing a character boisterous and aggressive enough to suit Wahlberg's mischievous grin and tough-guy looks. Terrence Howard is as icy cool as always playing a cop from the streets, and barring the overwrought performance Chiwetel Ejiofor as Victor Sweet, the mobbed-up head baddy, all the actors fit their roles well. Ejiofor is certainly meant to be over-the-top, but just as all the scenes that feature him, he just doesn't quite fit with the more street-level tone of the rest of the film.Singleton often looks as though he is still trying to direct music videos, which is an approach that often works, and often does not. The opening scenes of ""Four Brothers"" are great, as Singelton aptly sets the tone for the action to follow. Scenes of snow-covered Detroit and brotherly bonding are played to the songs of Marvin Gaye and Motown and set a real slick tone to the film that works well. There are stumbles, such as the heavy-handed Thanksgiving dinner scene, but for the most part these sequences are succinct enough to establish a genuine interest in the character and, therefore, a vest interest in the story to follow. As the film picks up so does the pace, sometimes thrillingly, as with the basketball game or the various action sequences, sometime disappointingly, as with the film's insistence on an ill-fated blacksploitation sub-plot, but in a way which is never boring. This is ultimately the true success of the film. It may be a reflection on the current state of Hollywood movies, but ""Four Brothers"", for all its faults and misguided straying, is a particularly successful movie because it at least never fails to entertain.I fear I have praised the film too much here. Don't get me wrong, I certainly rolled my eyes once or twice while watching (especially at the very last scene) and was disappointed by more than a few aspects of the film, but the parts that I was critical of disappointed mainly because the parts that did work worked so well. Wahlberg was one reason, Singleton's astute eye for slick entertainment was another, but the main reason the film worked was because it was content to be what is was: an unabashedly shallow, lively, and entertaining action film.",4,Genuinely Entertaining...Which is Rare,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,3936,"['Four', 'Brothers', 'successful', 'action', 'film', 'role', 'action', 'film', 'Too', 'many', 'entertainment', 'movies', 'lately', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'process', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'substantially', 'less', 'have', 'problem', 'experimentation', 'genre', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'experimentation', 'films', 'stick', 'basics', 'do', 'justice', 'become', 'rewarding', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'just', 'such', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'means', 'times', 'falls', 'hopelessly', 'traps', 'have', 'mentioned', 'when', 'what', 'best', 'better', 'action', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'John', 'Singleton', 'pace', 'tone', 'story', 'characters', 'doing', 'so', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'drearily', 'standard', 'become', 'something', 'substantially', 'more', 'Rather', 'mere', 'dull', 'formula', 'misguided', 'wandering', 'film', 'level', 'lively', 'entertainment', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'late', 'been', 'having', 'trouble', 'delivering.So', 'what', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'different', 'First', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'more', 'often', 'then', 'not', 'bog', 'down', 'pace', 'film', 'not', 'always', 'true', 'certainly', 'mid-film', 'lull', 'when', 'various', 'uninteresting', 'plot', 'twists', 'revelations', 'hold', 'back', 'good', 'old-fashioned', '@', 'kickings', 'majority', 'movie', 'plot', 'used', 'progress', 'rather', 'hold', 'back', 'action', 'nothing', 'works', 'better', 'unapologetically', 'violent', 'exuberant', 'action', 'movie', 'story', 'vengeance', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'best', 'when', 'not', 'trying', 'make', 'claims', 'contrary', 'acting', 'suits', 'film', 'also', 'especially', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'often', 'enjoy', 'who', 'here', 'obviously', 'enjoying', 'playing', 'character', 'boisterous', 'aggressive', 'enough', 'suit', 'Wahlberg', 'mischievous', 'grin', 'tough-guy', 'looks', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'icy', 'cool', 'always', 'playing', 'cop', 'streets', 'barring', 'overwrought', 'performance', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Victor', 'Sweet', 'mobbed-up', 'head', 'baddy', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles', 'well', 'Ejiofor', 'certainly', 'meant', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'just', 'scenes', 'feature', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'more', 'street-level', 'tone', 'rest', 'film.Singleton', 'often', 'still', 'trying', 'direct', 'music', 'videos', 'approach', 'often', 'often', 'not', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'are', 'great', 'Singelton', 'aptly', 'tone', 'action', 'follow', 'Scenes', 'snow-covered', 'Detroit', 'brotherly', 'bonding', 'are', 'played', 'songs', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Motown', 'set', 'real', 'slick', 'tone', 'film', 'well', 'are', 'stumbles', 'such', 'heavy-handed', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'scene', 'most', 'part', 'sequences', 'are', 'succinct', 'enough', 'establish', 'genuine', 'interest', 'character', 'therefore', 'vest', 'interest', 'story', 'follow', 'film', 'up', 'so', 'pace', 'sometimes', 'thrillingly', 'basketball', 'game', 'various', 'action', 'sequences', 'sometime', 'disappointingly', 'film', 'insistence', 'ill-fated', 'blacksploitation', 'sub-plot', 'way', 'never', 'boring', 'ultimately', 'true', 'success', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'reflection', 'current', 'state', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'faults', 'misguided', 'straying', 'particularly', 'successful', 'movie', 'least', 'never', 'entertain.I', 'fear', 'have', 'praised', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'certainly', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'once', 'twice', 'watching', 'especially', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'disappointed', 'more', 'few', 'aspects', 'film', 'parts', 'was', 'critical', 'disappointed', 'mainly', 'parts', 'did', 'work', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'Wahlberg', 'was', 'one', 'reason', 'Singleton', 'astute', 'eye', 'slick', 'entertainment', 'was', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'worked', 'was', 'was', 'content', 'be', 'what', 'was', 'unabashedly', 'shallow', 'lively', 'entertaining', 'action', 'film']",N/A

Bernabo,"[0, 0]","Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) was a saintly woman, a white-haired grandmother who tried to make things better in her neighborhood in Detroit. When we meet her she is in a convenience store convincing a young boy that shoplifting is not a good path to take in life. However, after winning that small but important victory she is brutally murdered along with the store clerk by a couple of masked men. Everybody who knew Evelyn comes to her funeral, including her four adopted sons. Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) are white, Angel (Tyrese Gibson) and Jeremiah( Andre Benjamin) are black, but such distinctions did not matter to Evelyn and they do not matter to these ""Four Brothers.""The four are Evelyn's only adopted sons because she managed to place all of the dozens of other foster children she took into her home. But these four were apparently incorrigible, which not only explains why they were never adopted but also why they are going to take matters into their own hands after their mother's funeral. They still try to be good to honor their mother, but unleashing their bad sides might be needed under the circumstances. Suffice it to say that her murder was not happenstance and most of John Singleton's film is devoted to finding out is responsible for her death and doing something about it. This does not sit well with Lt. Green (Terrence Howard) and Detective Fowler (Josh Charles), who are working the case and know all about the unsavory reputations of the Mercer boys, but clearly this part of the Motor City is run by the criminals, in this case the crime boss Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor). So we know who is ultimately guilty, but the question is why Evelyn had to die and that takes a while to unravel from the brothers' end of the story.I was going to say that the four brothers are willing to go where the police will not go and do what the cops are afraid to do, but since these cops are perfectly willing to beat up suspects during an interrogation it is clearly more the former than the latter than matters here (and there is a nice running gag of sorts involving a hair in a plastic bag).

940866,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000BDGW4Y,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[2, 2]","Albeit certainly not a masterpiece, this is a very watchable film mixing criminal mystery with some social drama. Below, more of my impressions with some SPOILERS.Years ago, Evelyn Mercer, a single white woman from Detroit (and a real saint according to everybody who knew her), adopted four of the most difficult orphaned boys living in a foster care center in her neighborhood - two white and two black. She raised them, then, once grown up, they went their separate ways. But after their adoptive mother was killed in what seems a banal stupid robbery which went horribly wrong, her boys are back home. And once the funeral is over, they start asking questions. And then the film really begins...The greatest quality of this resides in the interactions between the four brothers: Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jeremiah (Andr&eacute; Benjamin) and Jack (Garrett Hedlund). Bobby, the oldest, the meanest and the most violent is a somehow shady character, who did time for some quite serious felony. Angel, the strongest of them, also was in some trouble with the law, but before doing anything really serious he joined the Army and seems to have turned his life around. Jeremiah is a serious businessman, married with children. Finally Jack, the youngest and the most frail of them, who may or may not be homosexual, tries very hard to become a rock star - for the moment without success... A fifth person moves in with them soon after, Angel's old flame Sofi, better known as ""La vida loca"", played wondefully by Sofia Vergara - this character brings some humoristic element into this film. Sofi is also very much into threesomes, involving her, Angel and a washing machine...))) Finally there is the disturbing character of Victor Sweet, a rising star in Detroit's underworld, played magistrally by Chiwetel Ejiofor.I am not certain if director John Singleton (known best for his groundbreaking ""Boyz'n the hood"") was inspired by the old western classic ""The sons of Katie Elder"" - but for me this film looked very similar to this oldie but goldie. Indeed both films tell the story of four brothers who come to bury their mother, just to discover that her death was probably not so accidental as it seemed and also Bobby and Angel seem to some extent be the equivalents of John Wayne's and Dean Martin's characters. There are also some other similarities, but you will have to discover them by yourself.There are some elements in this film which I think were also inspired, at least a little, by the outstanding ""The Wire"" TV series, especially in the description of the criminal underworld of Detroit. This certainly gave this film more atmosphere...The ending is good and strong and rather surprising - and I didn't see it coming at all...So all in all, this is a solid, honest film, very watchable indeed.

Upon leaving the movie I reflected on that fact, and thanked the person for getting me to see the movie.  Four Brothers may not have Oscar potential, and it won't be a blockbuster, but it's one of the better films I've seen this year, and the subjects brought to face by the movie are eternal.  Morality, family, vengeance and justice are all themes that this movie forces us to confront.The movie opens in Detroit at a local convenience store.  An old woman is murdered when the store is robbed.  At the funeral there is a reunion of the woman's four adopted children.The adopted children are a collection of misfits and criminals.  Bobby Mercer played by Mark Wahlberg is the oldest.  These men are all tough, hardened men.  However, they have a large soft spot for their adopted mother and each other.  They are religious, they pray before meals.  They are good brothers, and it shows that family love is not about blood.  They are of different races, but race is no matter to them.  It's an important message.However, they are still violent people, and they decide to seek out vengeance for their mother's death.  This is the first moral theme, vengeance.  They want to make whoever killed their mother pay for the crime, and they go outside the law to do it.  It's vigilantism. Our protagonists, while we in the audience know them to be good people, force us to dissent in their ways.  But the question lingers, was their vigilantism right?The characters are moral, they are throwbacks to the cowboy era of America, and their John Wayne attitudes are juxtaposed with the cruel modernity of Detroit.  In America we love justice more than we love the law, and for the most part we know that law doesn't exist for its own sake.  This movie takes us across the gray and forces to question how far we'll take our beliefs in justice.This movie is violent but has good messages about race.  It has good messages about family.  It's also a wonderful story and every performance is done well.  It's worth the cost of admission.

Even her neighborhood, in troubled Detroit, is heartbroken at her tragic death.The mystery is unravelled through their pains-taking investigation into her death.

Bobby, Angel, Jerimiah, and Jackie Mercer all lived with Evelyn in her house till they were grown, and she saved them from much harder lives than they would have had.  Bobby is still a hardhead and a fighter.  Angel pulled a stint in the military, but remains a man of violence.  Jerimiah became an upstanding businessman and overextended his grasp.  Jackie was pure rock and roll.  One November night, Evelyn was gunned down in a convenience store.  Her sons come back to Detroit for her funeral and stay for revenge, having to stay one step ahead of the police to get the job done.  While fighting the bad guys, they also have to fight each other and find a way to pull together.Mark Wahlberg (INVINCIBLE, THE ITALIAN JOB) plays Bobby Mercer, putting together one of his street-tough roles that he does well.

John Singleton (2 FAST 2 FURIOUS, BABY BOY, SHAFT, BOYZ IN THE HOOD) directed.Definitely leading with an edgy revenge western feel, FOUR BROTHERS stands up, takes names, and kicks butt from the beginning.  The relationship between the four brothers feels real, not forced, and they seem to have a history together.  The pacing keeps the story moving along and introduces enough twists and turns and oddball characters that the viewer doesn't really know how everything is going to turn out.  The revenge motif will get answered, but perhaps not in the way that's expected.  The Detroit surroundings look real, and the chase through the snow was a great bit even though it was ultimately pretty simple.  Enough of the story was hidden to keep the viewer guessing the whole way through.

Her life was about helping every kid she could get a home and a chance at a better life. There were four kids she just couldn't find a home for; she gave them hers so they would grow up with some amount of love and positive direction in their lives even if the world outside thought they were nothing but trash. In return they loved her for it.Four Brothers opens with Evelyn providing some of her loving direction to a young boy who was stealing candy from a corner store. After he leaves she goes about her shopping. A few minutes later she hears two men come in and rob the place. It is a very intense scene where she ducks behind a shelving unit and listens to the interaction between a Black masked man and the young Indian clerk. The man in the mask makes a poignant statement about how a brother can't make no living from the country his in and shoots the clerk. Evelyn's squeal of shock alert to her presence and they find and kill her. Big mistake.Evelyn's four boys return home for her funeral, tie up affairs associated with a death and pick up where they left off as brothers. The four men; two black, two white and no blood relation are obviously brothers. In their neighbourhood they are known as the Mercer brothers: Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah, and Jack. As they begin to look into their mother's death they realize there's a little more to the story than a simple corner store robbery. The more they look the angrier they get and the angrier they get the more heads rolls. The police and the local crime boss are not going to keep them from their task of finding out the truth behind their mother's death.The movie had a slow start but once the action starts it doesn't stop. Four Brothers has great cinematography, action, acting and story. It was not predictable at all. Just when I thought I knew who was behind everything there's an exciting twist. I loved all four actors playing the brothers and am looking forward to seeing it again.

940887,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BDGW4Y,mirasreviews,"[1, 3]","""Four Brothers"" is a kind of urban Western with a straightforward revenge theme. Four grown brothers who were adopted by Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanigan) when they were delinquent youths reunite in Detroit for their mother's funeral. The eldest is Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), a lone wolf with street smarts and a real violent streak. Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) is a family man with plans for a business who stayed in Detroit. Angel (Tyrese Gibson) is an ex-Marine. And the youngest is Jackie (Garrett Hedlund), an aspiring musician who lacks the toughness of the others.  Evelyn was shot to death in a convenience store robbery. But when the brothers find out that her murder may have been premeditated, they set out to find out what happened and to avenge their mother's death. As the brothers rampage through their way to the culprits, police Lieutenant Green (Terrence Howard) is conducting his own investigation.""Four Brothers"" seemed to me a relentless violent rampage in which no one's behavior was redeemable or made any sense until I realized the film's structure and themes are similar to that of a classic Western. The brothers represent vigilante justice in a story about revenge, corruption, and a violent battle of wills and wits between 2 opposing forces. It's a masculine tale in which men fight over a wrong done to a woman, Evelyn, who remains foremost in their memories. Assuming you don't mind that the protagonists unquestioningly embrace brutality as their method of operation, whether the situation calls for it or not, the trouble is that the brothers lack depth and are completely devoid of ethics or any code of conduct. They think of no one but themselves and their own loss, which sets this apart from Westerns.Mark Wahlberg shows off his star quality as the leader of the pack. Tyrese Gibson is undeniably charismatic. Outkast member Andre Benjamin is certainly a convincing actor. Director John Singleton draws on 1970s cinema for the visual style. But these characters are only sporadically thoughtful, and their actions, no matter how hair-raising, are not interesting. There is a glaring error in the brothers' ages. The youngest, Jackie, was adopted at age 16. Bobby is at least 10 years older. The boys could not all have been in Evelyn's household at the same time. That may be a casting problem, not a script problem, but it's sloppy.The DVD (Paramount 2005): Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 9 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2  min), and an audio commentary by director John Singleton. ""The Look of The Brothers"" (10 min) talks about creating the look of winter in Detroit in Hamilton, Canada and Evelyn's house on a soundstage with director of photography Peter Menzies, Jr., production designer Keith Brian Burns, and costume designer Ruth Carter, among others. ""Crafting Four Brothers"" (10 min) interviews writers Paul Lovett and David Elliot about the characters and the action sequences, and John Singleton talks about the brothers' relationships. In ""Behind the Brotherhood"" (9 min) producer Lorenzo Di Bonaventura and the cast talk about Singleton's direction and each other. In ""Mercer House Shootout"" (4 min) special effects supervisor Neil Trifunovich explains how he created the shoot-out sequence. In the audio commentary, John Singleton provides a scene-by-scene comments on the choices he made, including technical details, performances, story, and editing.

Willoretta ""sgtwilly""","[0, 0]","this is a good one to watch. several nights ago, my girl would not shut up until I agreed to &#34;movie night&#34; and some &#34;couch time&#34;. So I reluctantly agreed. Usually my lady and I have a hard time settling on a movie we will both enjoy. I am a curmudgeony old punk rocker, and she is a bubbly, Filipina, ex-cheerleader, (I know...), so after much searching, we agreed to give this one a shot. i went in skeptical as usual, especially where Wahlberg is concerned, although he has done some good work, Three Kings for example, he has a tendency to put out a lot of Hollywood fluff, and if there is one thing this old punk can not stand, it is Hollywood fluff.This time, thank the merciful spirits, Mr. Wahlberg did some good work. Although this movie is really just some Hollywood fluff, at least the cast and crew had a sense of humor about it. I found it humorous, thoughtful, realistic(ish), entertaining, edgy enough to keep me interested, and possessed of enough plot intricacy to keep me guessing pretty much right up to the end. Speaking of the end, the ending was fairly bad ass.There were a few parts of the film that came across as kinda forced, or just cheezy; the main antagonist could have been written ALOT better. Overall though, I give it the four stars cuz it was good, not great, but definitely good. It definitely ain't winning any awards, but if you're not in the mood for anything but a casual movie night with the woman, or even your older kids, (13+ at least), this will most definitely keep you all entertained for a couple hours.Be warned though, there is some pretty tough violence here and there, a few straight up cold blooded murders by the main protagonists, who are consummate anti-heroes, (probably why I liked em so much). If you don't want to expose your family to thugs and violence portrayed in a realistic and human light, I'll just take this opportunity to point out that this movie definitely earned its &#34;R&#34; rating.",4,"dudes, you know when your lady just won't shut up about watching a movie together for date night or whatever?",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1973,"['good', 'one', 'watch', 'several', 'nights', 'ago', 'girl', 'would', 'not', 'shut', 'up', 'agreed', '34', 'movie', 'night', '34', '34', 'couch', 'time', '34', 'reluctantly', 'agreed', 'Usually', 'lady', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'settling', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'am', 'curmudgeony', 'old', 'punk', 'rocker', 'bubbly', 'Filipina', 'ex-cheerleader', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'searching', 'agreed', 'give', 'one', 'shot', 'i', 'went', 'skeptical', 'usual', 'especially', 'where', 'Wahlberg', 'concerned', 'done', 'good', 'work', 'Three', 'Kings', 'example', 'tendency', 'put', 'out', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'fluff', 'one', 'thing', 'old', 'punk', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'Hollywood', 'fluff.This', 'time', 'thank', 'merciful', 'spirits', 'Mr.', 'Wahlberg', 'did', 'good', 'work', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'fluff', 'least', 'cast', 'crew', 'had', 'sense', 'humor', 'found', 'humorous', 'thoughtful', 'realistic', 'ish', 'entertaining', 'edgy', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'possessed', 'enough', 'plot', 'intricacy', 'keep', 'guessing', 'pretty', 'much', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'Speaking', 'end', 'ending', 'was', 'fairly', 'bad', 'ass.There', 'were', 'few', 'parts', 'film', 'came', 'kinda', 'forced', 'just', 'cheezy', 'main', 'antagonist', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'ALOT', 'better', 'Overall', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'cuz', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'definitely', 'good', 'definitely', 'ai', ""n't"", 'winning', 'awards', ""'re"", 'not', 'mood', 'anything', 'casual', 'movie', 'night', 'woman', 'even', 'older', 'kids', '13+', 'least', 'will', 'most', 'definitely', 'keep', 'entertained', 'couple', 'hours.Be', 'warned', 'pretty', 'tough', 'violence', 'here', 'there', 'few', 'straight', 'up', 'cold', 'blooded', 'murders', 'main', 'protagonists', 'who', 'are', 'consummate', 'anti-heroes', 'probably', 'why', 'liked', 'em', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'expose', 'family', 'thugs', 'violence', 'portrayed', 'realistic', 'human', 'light', ""'ll"", 'just', 'take', 'opportunity', 'point', 'out', 'movie', 'definitely', 'earned', '34', 'R', '34', 'rating']",N/A

While there is action here, it's not heroic, larger than life action I generally prefer.  Indeed, it's down and dirty, ugly and distasteful.  But it works very well due to some excellent direction.  The car chase in particular is riveting while never being especially slick.But this is not, strictly speaking, an action film.  It's a film about family, about flawed people trying to get by.

I am not a fan of John Singleton, nor do I go out of my way to watch gangst related movies or listen to music, but this was an interesting movie in so many ways.The Four Brothers, Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah and Jack, have reunited over the death of their adoptive mother.  Gunned down seemingly at random in a local grocery store, the four return to their hometown of Detroit for her funeral.  They discover that their mother's murder wasn't exactly a random act of violence but part of a larger plot whose motivations seem unknown.  They go out on the prowl, attempting to find how it is that their mother, a seemingly insignifigant person, is connceted to a sticky web of crime from the police department through the crime kingpins of Detroit.This was a good movie in the fact that you know from the beginning that there is far more to their mother's murder than meets the eye.  They will eventually overturn rocks and stones to find out more.  The obvious comic relief of Angel's Latino girlfriend's hot blooded explosions make for some funny moments.  Their past as troubled kids will aid their search (breaking into houses, firearms, etc.), making them forces to be reconed with.  Their obvious distain for the police and knowledge of police tactics to make them confess to something they didn't do also makes them smarter and crafier than the ""bad guys"" and ""good guys"".  Plus the violence of Detroit as a backdrop always make for good times.  Why not five stars?  The plot eventually thins out towards the end.

Four Brothers bursts at the seams with action that keeps you on the edge of your seat as well as a plot that keeps you guessing.

I'm as close to a cynical hack as a layman can be but he managed to convince me that these four very different men, (two white and two black), were actually brothers. They are adoptive brothers of course but they seemed to share the bond and love of brotherhood that you sometimes don't see in men related by blood.The story is so straightforward, so predictable: the mother gets gunned down during a grocery store holdup. We're meant to believe that it was a random shooting but we later find out that it wasn't. The four brothers set out on a quest for revenge. There's lots of action, lots of shooting, Mark Wahlberg gets to look mean, Tyrese Gibson takes his shirt off (or did I just imagine that?) and Andre Benjamin does what many rappers/singers turned actors get to do on screen - he gets to look pretty.And then there was Garrett Hedlund. As the gay character he naturally gets bumped off relatively early on in the movie (like I said, so predictable) but I resented the fact that the only reason a gay character seemed to have been introduced into the story was so he could be the butt of so many anti-gay jokes. Interestingly though, this brotherly homophobia came only from the Wahlberg character i.e. the white brother. The two black brothers didn't once go there. Er, okay, I find THAT one believable. I think a statement was being made there, though I'm not exactly sure what.The revelation of the movie for me however, was Chiwetel Ejiofor as the cold blooded ganster, Victor Sweet. Not only is his American accent 100% authentic (at least to these ears) he plays against type in a way that shows a new depth to his acting abilities. I'd say look out as this is definitely a man on the way up.The DVD extras include stuff that shows us how the scenes were crafted and especially, how the 'Mercer House Shootout' scene was filmed. I thought that part of the movie was shot on location and it's really cool to see how they can make up a set with CGI stuff in the background to make it all look like a real neighbourhood.All in all, not counting the groundbreaking classic ""Boyz In The Hood"" and putting my gripe about the way the movie dealt with the issue of homosexuality, (for which I took away one star - I would've given it four), I would say this is the John Singleton movie I've enjoyed the most. I'm glad I waited to see it on DVD and I'm glad I bought it rather than paid to rent it.

I had not expected to run out and buy a copy after seeing it so I could watch it time and time again; I did not expect to love it, only to be entertained. And I was entertained, at parts...but only a few of them.The self-help street justice that the brothers turn to in their effort to avenge their adopted mother's killer was over-the-top unbelievable. The ""saintly"" woman who took these lost-cause boys into her home apparently did not do nearly as good of a job raising them as everyone gave her credit for. She took these boys when no one else wanted them. She gave them a home when no one else would. In her and each other, they had family. But then they grew up, went their separate ways and never got off the streets. Only one of the four appears to have his head on straight.Marky Mark was good in his role, but the role just wasn't impressive. None of the roles were. The writing and the action were hijacked out of some 80s movie that is only aired on the basic channels Saturday afternoons when the networks have nothing else to show. I would have thought the film industry had evolved beyond movies like this.I am usually a supporter of violence in movies. In most action movies it can paint a picture. In Four Brothers it was senseless and unnecessary as it just leads you back to the idea that what the brothers got away with was completely ridiculous.The ending. Oh my, the ending.

940920,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000BDGW4Y,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","""Four Brothers"" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty ""Boyz n the Hood"" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, ""Four Brothers"" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more.",2,"contrived, implausible crime drama",1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,2000,"['Four', 'Brothers', 'yet', 'nail', 'coffin', 'John', 'Singleton', 'increasingly', 'moribund', 'moviemaking', 'career', 'director', 'who', 'burst', 'scene', '1991', 'vibrant', 'gritty', 'Boyz', 'n', 'Hood', 'here', 'mounted', 'film', 'so', 'burdened', 'implausibility', 'contrivance', 'one', 'wonder', 'once-promising', 'filmmaker', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'again', 'story', 'reeking', 'artificiality', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'four', 'troubled', 'young', 'men', 'raised', 'same', 'foster', 'mother', 'When', 'killed', 'convenience', 'store', 'robbery', 'quartet', 'action', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'perpetrators', 'becoming', 'slowly', 'convinced', 'investigation', 'neighborhood', 'killing', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'random', 'nature', 'had', 'been', 'initially', 'led', 'believe.The', 'main', 'weakness', 'film', 'virtually', 'reason', 'care', 'characters', 'not', 'showing', 'scenes', 'boys', 'foster', 'mother', 'one', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'were', 'conceived', 'first-year', 'film', 'student', 'are', 'forced', 'take', 'relationship', 'totally', 'faith', 'rendering', 'boys', 'thirst', 'revenge', 'arbitrary', 'worst', 'academic', 'best.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'flat', 'characters', 'little', 'more', 'wafer-thin', 'stereotypes', 'even', 'action', 'come', 'surprisingly', 'mundane', 'second-rate', 'given', 'Singleton', 'pedigree', 'area', 'boys', 'running', 'around', 'venue', 'venue', 'Detroit', 'neighborhood', 'brandishing', 'guns', 'full', 'view', 'populace', 'screaming', 'information', 'mother', 'killer', 'ludicrous', 'face', 'often', 'film', 'level', 'cheap', 'low', 'comedy', 'burlesque.With', 'nary', 'single', 'moment', 'believable', 'true', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'by-the-book', 'filmmaking', 'director', 'who', 'proven', 'wherewithal', 'talent', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'more']",N/A

The four meet to find out who killed their brother and although the other three realize this may be heavier than they thought, there's always that one testosterone heavy guy who think he's Superman.  Mr. Testosterone is the ringleader in many fights, shoot-outs, and all four unite for justice.  This movie is proof of how brother bond, regardless of race, when loyalty comes into play.  I'm definitely glad I gave it a second chance.Side Note: The soundtrack music is on point.  Classic music by artists like the Temptations and Marvin Gaye play in the background, which makes this modern day western even cooler.

The story line however is a bit different, not following any pre-set revenge flick formula.  The Mercer brothers - foster brothers in fact- return home to bury their sainted foster mother Evelyn Mercer (played by Fionnula Flanagan).  And Evelyn's boys, who have been for the most channeled into productive lives through her efforts, certainly are familiar with the code of the street.  Once Evelyn's buried, it's time for an eye for an eye - and then some.  I know, this sounds formula like, but it isn't.  What distinguishes this movie is how director Singleton give all the characters dimension and depth, but in such a way that never strips the move of it's shoot-em-up nature.  Make no mistake, this is an extremely violent movie, but at its heart it teaches, without preaching, mutual love and respect for family.  Given the vehicle, a revenge flick, this is a really hard to thing to pull off, with most directors just increasing the body count and bullets to compensate.  But Singleton succeeds brilliantly.  In particular, I was impressed by what must be one of Wahlberg's best performances.  Too often lately he's been packaged as some sort of super cool Steve McQueen type, a really icy dude. In contrast, ""Four Brothers"" taps into Wahlberg's inner thug, seeing at last the fire and passion that you sensed was always there, but had been kept largely under wraps.  Well, as it says on the tattoo on his back: ""No Mercy"" (This is for you Mom).  This is a B flick, but one with a heart of gold that nevertheless refuses to compromise its street sense.

Various scenes include an attack by dobermans, gang style executions, a bare-knuckle brawl and an all out gang war. The most gory scene shows a brief shot of a compound fracture.That out of the way, it is an interesting and emotionally engaging movie. This is the story of four brothers trying to track down the killers of their adoptive mother. The relationships between the brothers are very well developed, and seeing their growth and conflict adds a great deal to what could otherwise be just a frag-fest. Bobby (played by Mark Wahlberg) is the unofficial leader of the four. His tactics are effective, although none too subtle. On the other side of the coin is Jeremiah, a play-it-straight family man who would mostly like to put the whole thing behind him.As they carry on their search, each of them learns more about the others. Through their arguments you sense the bonds between them straining and strengthening. At its most serious, the one brother is implicated in the plotting of their mother's murder. Their anger and affection for each other create a strong sense of community.Other than the violence I mentioned earlier, my only real complaint is that their mother (particularly after her death) is portrayed as ridiculously angelic.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[1, 1]","Four Brothers is the latest film by director John Singleton who back in the early 90's made Boyz N The Hood to a mass of critical and audience acclaim.Singleton's newest feature stars singers turned actors: the already veterenated actor Mark Wahlberg, Outkast's Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson, and the up and coming actor Garrett Hedlund as four adopted brothers who return to their old neighborhood and home in Detroit after their foster mother is shot to death at a local convenient store to seek revenge.The movie attempts to mix light humor in its dialogue while turning the knob up on the anger, melancholy and frustration the boys endure as they are out to get the guys who killed their beloved gaurdian. There are the usual twists and turns along the way but the revenge remains very straightforward, Singleton style.There are no over the top performances by any of our main characters including the supporting cast that features Terrence Howard, who just recently shined in the Singleton produced Hustle And Flow, and Josh Charles, but the movie makes its point by succeeding in grabbing your attention even through the usual revenge/action-movie cliches that it's filled with.RecommendedB-",4,Four Brothers...make their point,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,1197,"['Four', 'Brothers', 'latest', 'film', 'director', 'John', 'Singleton', 'who', 'back', 'early', '90', 'made', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'mass', 'critical', 'audience', 'acclaim.Singleton', 'newest', 'feature', 'singers', 'turned', 'actors', 'already', 'veterenated', 'actor', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Outkast', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'up', 'coming', 'actor', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'four', 'adopted', 'brothers', 'who', 'return', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'home', 'Detroit', 'foster', 'mother', 'shot', 'death', 'local', 'convenient', 'store', 'seek', 'revenge.The', 'movie', 'attempts', 'mix', 'light', 'humor', 'dialogue', 'turning', 'knob', 'up', 'anger', 'melancholy', 'frustration', 'boys', 'endure', 'are', 'out', 'get', 'guys', 'who', 'killed', 'beloved', 'gaurdian', 'are', 'usual', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'revenge', 'very', 'straightforward', 'Singleton', 'are', 'top', 'performances', 'main', 'characters', 'including', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'who', 'just', 'recently', 'shined', 'Singleton', 'produced', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'movie', 'point', 'succeeding', 'grabbing', 'attention', 'even', 'usual', 'revenge/action-movie', 'cliches', 'filled', 'with.RecommendedB-']",N/A

The story line took over the movie, and surpassed the action, in my humble opinion.Four adoptive brothers, each with his own troublesome past, were adopted by a 'well know' foster mother in a very bad neighborhood. She adopted the boys that everyone doubted. Their mother is murdered in a grocery store incident and the town shuts down in a typical ""noone saw a thing"" attitude. Suddenly the Mercer brothers are back, Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah and Jack, together for the funeral... After the mourning, it's time to find out who killed Mom.The movie has heart pumping scenes of car chases and shoot-outs in the middle of the street. Gangster angst and big cars. Action packed, it is, but let us not miss the relationship of these Four Brothers, with their mother and the impact their love has on those around them.This movie surpassed my expectations.

940939,A2M597GCCE1N2S,B000BDGW4Y,"the one and only ""david""","[3, 3]","Four Brothers is the story of heartbreak, emotion, and revenge driven characters and it is very good at emotional scenes and also action shots. This is one of the rare movies in which you actually believe in what the main characters are fighting for and how the death of one human being can effect so many people and cause so much grief...After the death of Evelyn Mercer in a store robbery, her four adopted sons: Bobby [Mark Wahlberg], Angel [Tyrese Gibson], Jeremiah [Andre Benjamin], and Jack ""CrackerJack"" [Garret Hedlund], return to the town that the grew up in for her funeral.The thing that links the audience to the characters is that all four of them aren't even related, but were all adopted by the kind woman who knew that they didn't even have a secure future in their lives. Angel and Jeremiah are black, and Bobby and Jack are white. However the four brothers still love each other and consider themselves family, no matter how many people look at them strangely as they call themselves brothers.The plot of the movie takes a dark turn as the four brothers start to learn that the random murder of Evelyn may not have been random at all. What results from that startling revelation is that Bobby, Angel, and Jack disobey police orders to not get involved in the case and go on a driven quest to find out who killed their beloved mother and why.The movie is filled with violence, and strong language. Some scenes involve drive by shootings, a wild car chase between the brothers and the two men who killed their mom, and a fist fight at the end between one of the brothers [I won't spoil who it is] and the sole man responsible for the death.Crooked cops, corrupt politicains, gang members, and organized crime all take shots at the four men and some scenes seem to have a million bullets flying everywhere. But there are moments of intense excitement and none of the action scenes seem to be overdone on violent killings. This is one movie that actually puts in the right amount of violence, mixed with the perfect amount of character buildup and even some bonding between the brothers that even they didn't know they could have.Extras of the Disks:Commentary by director John SingletonBehind the Brotherhood [A look at the different characters]Some deleted scenesEnglish and Spanish subtitlesand a showing of the making of the movieplus more....Highly recommended, this is one movie you need to see at least once......",4,Four and 1/2 stars for one emotionally charged action thriller...,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2434,"['Four', 'Brothers', 'story', 'heartbreak', 'emotion', 'revenge', 'driven', 'characters', 'very', 'good', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'also', 'action', 'shots', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'actually', 'believe', 'what', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'fighting', 'how', 'death', 'one', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'effect', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'cause', 'so', 'much', 'grief', 'death', 'Evelyn', 'Mercer', 'store', 'robbery', 'four', 'adopted', 'sons', 'Bobby', '[', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', ']', 'Angel', '[', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', ']', 'Jeremiah', '[', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', ']', 'Jack', 'CrackerJack', '[', 'Garret', 'Hedlund', ']', 'return', 'town', 'grew', 'up', 'funeral.The', 'thing', 'audience', 'characters', 'four', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'related', 'were', 'adopted', 'kind', 'woman', 'who', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'secure', 'future', 'lives', 'Angel', 'Jeremiah', 'are', 'black', 'Bobby', 'Jack', 'are', 'white', 'However', 'four', 'brothers', 'still', 'love', 'other', 'consider', 'family', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'look', 'strangely', 'call', 'brothers.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'dark', 'turn', 'four', 'brothers', 'start', 'learn', 'random', 'murder', 'Evelyn', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'random', 'What', 'results', 'startling', 'revelation', 'Bobby', 'Angel', 'Jack', 'disobey', 'police', 'orders', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'case', 'go', 'driven', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'beloved', 'mother', 'why.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'violence', 'strong', 'language', 'scenes', 'involve', 'drive', 'shootings', 'wild', 'car', 'chase', 'brothers', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'mom', 'fist', 'fight', 'end', 'one', 'brothers', '[', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'who', ']', 'sole', 'man', 'responsible', 'death.Crooked', 'cops', 'corrupt', 'politicains', 'gang', 'members', 'organized', 'crime', 'take', 'shots', 'four', 'men', 'scenes', 'seem', 'have', 'million', 'bullets', 'flying', 'everywhere', 'are', 'moments', 'intense', 'excitement', 'none', 'action', 'seem', 'be', 'overdone', 'violent', 'killings', 'one', 'movie', 'actually', 'right', 'amount', 'violence', 'mixed', 'perfect', 'amount', 'character', 'buildup', 'even', 'bonding', 'brothers', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'have.Extras', 'Disks', 'Commentary', 'director', 'John', 'SingletonBehind', 'Brotherhood', 'look', 'different', 'characters', ']', 'deleted', 'scenesEnglish', 'Spanish', 'subtitlesand', 'showing', 'making', 'movieplus', 'more', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'one', 'movie', 'need', 'see', 'least', 'once']",N/A
940940,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000BDGW4Y,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[77, 92]","Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) drives into his childhood Detroit neighborhood, returning home to bury his adopted mother, Evelyn (Fionnula Flanagan, ""The Others""). At the funeral, he meets up with two of his three other brothers; Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin of Outkast fame), now a family and business man, and Jack (Garret Hedlund). Evelyn was the foster mother for hundreds of kids and adopted Bobby and his brothers when no one would have them. After the funeral, they return to her house and find their fourth sibling, Angel (Tyrese Gibson), sitting on the porch. Soon, they learn that Evelyn's death, during a convenience store robbery, may have been more than a simple case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. An old childhood friend, Green (Terrence Howard, ""Hustle and Flow"", ""Crash""), now a detective, warns them against taking matters into their own hands. But take matters they do, and they begin to investigate, leading them closer and closer to a local gangster, Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""Dirty Pretty Things"", ""Melinda and Melinda"").When you read the synopsis of ""Four Brothers"", or hear about it, each of the elements seems to say ""Huh? That won't work. That can't work."" But combined, and married to good acting, good writing and good directing by John Singleton, the film is a surprisingly effective dramatic tale.The key to the film's success is that it is R-rated. I don't necessarily need to see an R-rated film every time I go to the movies, but if the film is about four men trying to find the person who killed their mother, on the mean streets of Detroit, an R-rating will allow the filmmaker to be more realistic. In this age of PG-13 horror and action films, something gets lost. In a horror film, I expect to see some blood. In a PG-13 horror film, you aren't going to see a lot. In an R-rated action film, I expect to see some violence. ""Brothers"" is all the more realistic because Bobby and his siblings throw some punches, people get hit by bullets and they use some R-rated words. They grew up in the slums of Detroit. I wouldn't expect them to say ""Gee, I'm sorry for that"" or something equally as innocuous. And because the story centers on their quest to find a killer, some violence is to be expected. And delivered. Much like the recent R-rated ""Wedding Crashers"", filled with rating appropriate humor, I applaud this recent trend to deliver films with content appropriate ratings rather than trying to tailor the content for a kid-friendly (or a teenager friendly) rating. Filmmakers should stand by their vision and not allow it to be changed to meet an artificial rating.Because of the R-rating, Singleton is able to allow the characters to be true to themselves. Because Bobby lives in a violent world, he doesn't have to think twice about using violence to get to his goal. Bobby is a really complex character and Wahlberg does a great job of conveying the conflicting emotions at work. Green introduces each of the Mercer boys to his partner, Fowler (Josh Charles), as they sit in their car watching each arrive for the funeral. After Green describes their various criminal records, Fowler is incredulous that Evelyn is regarded so highly in the community. ""But, they are all the Dalai Lama compared to what they would've been without her influence."" Bobby is clearly affected by his mother's memory and influence, especially staying in her home, but he desperately wants to find out the truth. As the oldest of the four boys, he also has to provide protection and leadership to his brothers.Andre Benjamin is also surprisingly good. Often musicians don't make the transition to film well (Hello, Mariah Carey? Lance Bass? Justin Timberlake?), but Benjamin shows some real acting ability. He also shows his seriousness for the medium and doesn't sing during the film, or on the soundtrack. He is a family man with a wife and two daughters to think about, so he doesn't participate as quickly in his brothers' scheme. But when he becomes linked to the action, he realizes he has no choice and reluctantly participates. Angel and Jack are really Bobby's henchmen throughout, following him without objection to any corner of the neighborhood.Terrence Howard does some good work as Green, but it is a supporting role and, compared to his other work in ""Crash"" and ""Hustle and Flow"", unremarkable.As Evelyn, Fionnula Flanagan has the least amount of screen time, but she manages to instantly convey why this woman was so revered in the community. Before she is shot, she has a brief exchange with a local boy in the convenience store, quickly establishing her character. Later in the film, each of the boys imagines her talking to them. All of these appearances establish her as a tough, but kind woman who is only afraid when someone is pointing a gun at her face.Chiwetel Ejiofor plays one of the most chilling villains in a long time. Victor Sweet is a vicious man and will take anything and kill anyone he wants. The final scenes involving him are particularly memorable, because the outcome is unexpected, yet believable.Singleton is clearly trying to evoke the feel of gangster films from the 70s; Wahlberg even drives around in an old car from this period throughout most of the film. The cinematography is gritty and the soundtrack is filled with songs from this era. All of this adds to the feel of the film, making everything stand out.But the film is most successful because it doesn't pull any punches. ""Four Brothers"" is a gritty, violent, believable look at the revenge four brothers take for their beloved mother's death.",4,"Effective, well-made drama",1124064000,"08 15,

940945,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BDGW4Y,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 10]","Though set in modern-day Detroit, `Four Brothers' goes like old-fashioned Western film. First you witness one violent death, which causes the four tough guys get together again, in the town where they were raised as bad boys, and in the name of justice they begin their own fight against crimes. The vendetta story is told with John Singleton's rather inconsistent storytelling, mixing sentimental moments, violent actions, and not-so-sophisticated humors. Don't expect too much from the rambling storyline and some of the formulaic set-pieces (from the writer team David Elliot and Paul Lovett). But the film remains engaging throughout thanks to the portraits of 'Four Brothers.'Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund are the `Four Brothers' who search the truths behind the killings by the two masked guys at the grocery store because the victims included their `Mother' Evelyn (Fionnula Flanagan). But who is really responsible for the death of their foster parent? The script gives some hints early on (in fact, there's a fairly big hint in the opening credits) so the film's point is not a whodunit. It's about the brotherhood of the four guys, which is severely tested by the bullets and blood.I don't say the acting of the four actors is exceptional, but still they are good and believable. I am not still sure of Wahlberg's acting capacity, and his acting here didn't change my mind about that, but he is OK. Andre Benjamin shows surprisingly good acting after his comic turn in `Be Cool,' but it is Terrence Howard who adds precious tone of subtlety as Lt. Green and though briefly, the appearance of Flanagan gives humane touch to the otherwise generic story. Compared with the males, young females are given less attention from director, and Singleton shows almost no interest in developing the character of Sofi, speaking Spanish, hot-tempered, etc. played by Sofia Vergara.But after all we don't see Westerns for females, and maybe Singleton should not be blamed. It is certain that `Four Brothers' gives what it promises in its title - four guys avenging the beloved one's death. The Good vs. the Bad, or Justice with Violence. In this film, they are done not in the wild West, but in the frosty streets of cold Detroit (with Motown music). You either like or hate the film for the same reasons. I didn't hate it, but must say that I am not a big fan of Singleton's uneven narrative style. Still, four stars for four brothers.",4,(3.5 STARS) Above Average Revenge Story: Western Reinvented For Modern Detroit,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,2468,"['Though', 'set', 'modern-day', 'Detroit', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'old-fashioned', 'Western', 'film', 'First', 'witness', 'one', 'violent', 'death', 'four', 'tough', 'guys', 'get', 'together', 'again', 'town', 'where', 'were', 'raised', 'bad', 'boys', 'name', 'justice', 'begin', 'own', 'fight', 'crimes', 'vendetta', 'story', 'told', 'John', 'Singleton', 'rather', 'inconsistent', 'storytelling', 'mixing', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'violent', 'actions', 'not-so-sophisticated', 'humors', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'rambling', 'storyline', 'formulaic', 'set-pieces', 'writer', 'team', 'David', 'Elliot', 'Paul', 'Lovett', 'film', 'engaging', 'thanks', 'portraits', ""'Four"", 'Brothers', 'Wahlberg', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'are', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'who', 'search', 'truths', 'killings', 'two', 'masked', 'guys', 'grocery', 'store', 'victims', 'included', 'Mother', 'Evelyn', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'who', 'really', 'responsible', 'death', 'foster', 'parent', 'script', 'hints', 'early', 'fact', 'fairly', 'big', 'hint', 'opening', 'credits', 'film', 'point', 'not', 'whodunit', 'brotherhood', 'four', 'guys', 'severely', 'tested', 'bullets', 'blood.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'acting', 'four', 'actors', 'exceptional', 'still', 'are', 'good', 'believable', 'am', 'not', 'still', 'sure', 'Wahlberg', 'acting', 'capacity', 'acting', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'mind', 'OK.', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'acting', 'comic', 'turn', 'Be', 'Cool', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'who', 'precious', 'tone', 'subtlety', 'Lt.', 'Green', 'briefly', 'appearance', 'Flanagan', 'touch', 'otherwise', 'generic', 'story', 'Compared', 'males', 'young', 'females', 'are', 'given', 'less', 'attention', 'director', 'Singleton', 'almost', 'interest', 'developing', 'character', 'Sofi', 'speaking', 'Spanish', 'hot-tempered', 'etc', 'played', 'Sofia', 'Vergara.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Westerns', 'females', 'maybe', 'Singleton', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'blamed', 'certain', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'what', 'title', 'four', 'guys', 'avenging', 'beloved', 'one', 'death', 'Good', 'vs.', 'Bad', 'Justice', 'Violence', 'film', 'are', 'done', 'not', 'wild', 'West', 'frosty', 'streets', 'cold', 'Detroit', 'Motown', 'music', 'either', 'hate', 'film', 'same', 'reasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Singleton', 'uneven', 'narrative', 'style', 'Still', 'four', 'stars', 'four', 'brothers']",N/A
