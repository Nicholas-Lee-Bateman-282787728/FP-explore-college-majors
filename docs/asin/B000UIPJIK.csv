I think it's the letters bouncing, maybe it's the simple music?  He just likes to watch it over and over again, and says it with the video.  Great, simple videos for sure.

This video is nothing more than animated flashcards, where a word appears on the screen and is then repeated verbally a couple of times.  It took me all of 15 minutes to find free software on the Internet that does the same thing, and I can type in whatever words I want.

I think if your child will watch it it will do no harm and actually help.  I was blessed enough to see it on Amazon and then find it at the library so I didn't waste any money but the little bit of gas that I used.  If my child likes it at any point I will buy the other 2 volumes since the library didn't have them.  I think it is a great concept but extremely boring.  I think this would be something like ""Your Baby Can Read."" It is another resource that you can occasionally view.

For example, the word ""play"" is brought to life with a smiling letter p holding the letter ""l"" as a baseball bat, while the letter ""a"" is made up as a baseball glove and a happy letter ""y"" sits like a game spectator.
