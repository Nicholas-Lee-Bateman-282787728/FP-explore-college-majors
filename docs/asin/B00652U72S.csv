Much to my surprise, I found it very well done and very accurate.  Some of us who are older know very well that rumors can travel by word of mouth with just as horrific consequences as the internet.  The internet is worse, however, because we got to leave school for a few hours.  With the internet, the harrassment is worse because it's also in your home.What's really amazing to me is that there was also the issue of forgiveness with one character and Taylor (Emily Osment), and the movie is great for that reason.  It shows the absolute cruelty of what's going on out there, and also Taylor's willingness to forgive the person who hurt her the most (not giving that one away).  Everyone should see this movie, regardless of age, because the message is strong and very effective.  Don't wait as long as I did.

No mainstream releases for movies lacking huge special effects, even when they are important, I guess.This movie was definitely important. It was hard to watch, but that was because it was so accurate. If you've never been bullied, you'll probably think it's silly and overdramatic, but it's not. As the bully admits at the end, when you do it online, you don't even realize you're doing it. It doesn't seem real. It's just a computer screen. You can't see the person you're hurting. You can't see the pain in their eyes or the hurt on their face. And that's why cyberbullying has become so prevalent. Cowards do it. People who would never have the guts to say something to someone's face have no problem saying something to an inexpressive computer screen. And they have no idea the damage they cause. And the victims have no recourse. You can't go to the police with internal bruising. As it stated at the end of the movie, just over half the states now have laws that help with cyberbulling. But they only help, they don't actually punish the bullies or efectively stop it. And they presently only deal with minors. Adults can be bullied too and there are apparently no laws at all dealing with that yet.I'd recommend this movie be shown in schools, but I imagine a lot of kids would laugh at it if it were shown in a group setting. Parents should show it to their kids individually, maybe. I think a lot of adults would benifit from watching it as well.",5,Heartbreaking,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,1573,"['can', 'not', 'believe', 'are', 'only', '3', 'reviews', 'movie', 'March', '21', 'anyway', 'EVERYONE', 'see', 'movie', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'lacking', 'huge', 'special', 'effects', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'important', 'guess.This', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'important', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'accurate', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'bullied', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'think', 'silly', 'overdramatic', 'not', 'bully', 'end', 'when', 'do', 'online', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', ""'re"", 'doing', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'just', 'computer', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'person', ""'re"", 'hurting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'pain', 'eyes', 'hurt', 'face', 'why', 'cyberbullying', 'become', 'so', 'prevalent', 'Cowards', 'do', 'People', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'guts', 'say', 'something', 'someone', 'face', 'have', 'problem', 'saying', 'something', 'inexpressive', 'computer', 'screen', 'have', 'idea', 'damage', 'cause', 'victims', 'have', 'recourse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'police', 'internal', 'bruising', 'stated', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'states', 'now', 'have', 'laws', 'help', 'cyberbulling', 'only', 'help', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'punish', 'bullies', 'efectively', 'stop', 'presently', 'only', 'deal', 'minors', 'Adults', 'can', 'be', 'bullied', 'too', 'are', 'apparently', 'laws', 'dealing', 'yet.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'be', 'shown', 'schools', 'imagine', 'lot', 'kids', 'would', 'laugh', 'were', 'shown', 'group', 'setting', 'Parents', 'should', 'show', 'kids', 'individually', 'maybe', 'think', 'lot', 'adults', 'would', 'benifit', 'watching', 'as', 'well']",Cyberbully

When Taylor first gets her laptop everything is fine but when her brother hacks her account and posts an inappropriate post as a joke the chaos begins. A lot of bullying cases related to suicide indeed start this way with a mistake such as an inappropriate post, a bad haircut, or even a rumor it's where the bullying begins. Over the rest of the film as I said before the story shows almost perfectly the bullying circle the almost being the fact that the events are accelerated what normally transpires over a few months or even years is done over a few weeks but that is to be expected.
