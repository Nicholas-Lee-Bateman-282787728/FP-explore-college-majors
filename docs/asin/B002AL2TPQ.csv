1258276,A21YJPHV31QQ92,B002AL2TPQ,Mr. J. Murdock,"[0, 0]","The word ""brilliant"" is an often times overused word in British pop culture but Pulling Season 2 is simply Brilliant. Brilliant because it's one of those sitcoms you can watch again and again and not get sick and tired of it. You see the punchline but you're still laughing. Sharon Horgan did a brilliant job in Season 2, bringing back characters who made a cameo appearance in season one and giving them more substantial roles in the series. Richard, Oleg, and Ian are back, as is Donna's frenemy Tanya.Louise's ingenious business idea had me bawling over in laughter. Let me put it this way: you will never think of popsicle the same way ever again! Karen gets even worse as she hooks up with her old flame Billy. But I must say episode 2 of Season 2 was Donna at her most egotistical and self-centered best: her old friend Catherine, who lives in the US but is back in England on a visit. She has been invited to a dinner party hosted by Donna at her flat.The scene at the cafe highlights what a great actress Sharon Horgan can be without saying anything. Catherine, who had been wearing the same exact cardigan when she met Donna, was ordering coffee. Donna slowly gazes down noticing her best friend's cardigan. When Catherine turns around and looks at her, Donna just flashes a sweet, innocent smile. Before the dinner party was about to begin, Donna tidies her flat and, to show off what a sophisticated thinker she is to her old friend, takes the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth, a film she rented but hadn't seen, and prominently displays it on her book case. Just smart comedic acting by Horgan without speaking any words.",5,One word: Brilliant,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,1642,"['word', 'brilliant', 'often', 'times', 'overused', 'word', 'British', 'pop', 'culture', 'Pulling', 'Season', '2', 'simply', 'Brilliant', 'Brilliant', 'one', 'sitcoms', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'not', 'get', 'sick', 'tired', 'see', 'punchline', ""'re"", 'still', 'laughing', 'Sharon', 'Horgan', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'Season', '2', 'bringing', 'back', 'characters', 'who', 'made', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'season', 'one', 'giving', 'more', 'substantial', 'roles', 'series', 'Richard', 'Oleg', 'Ian', 'are', 'back', 'Donna', 'frenemy', 'Tanya.Louise', 'ingenious', 'business', 'idea', 'had', 'bawling', 'over', 'laughter', 'Let', 'put', 'way', 'will', 'never', 'think', 'popsicle', 'same', 'way', 'ever', 'again', 'Karen', 'even', 'worse', 'up', 'old', 'flame', 'Billy', 'must', 'say', 'episode', '2', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'Donna', 'most', 'egotistical', 'self-centered', 'best', 'old', 'friend', 'Catherine', 'who', 'US', 'back', 'England', 'visit', 'been', 'invited', 'dinner', 'party', 'hosted', 'Donna', 'flat.The', 'scene', 'cafe', 'highlights', 'what', 'great', 'actress', 'Sharon', 'Horgan', 'can', 'be', 'saying', 'anything', 'Catherine', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'wearing', 'same', 'exact', 'cardigan', 'when', 'met', 'Donna', 'was', 'ordering', 'coffee', 'Donna', 'slowly', 'down', 'noticing', 'best', 'friend', 'cardigan', 'When', 'Catherine', 'around', 'Donna', 'just', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'smile', 'dinner', 'party', 'was', 'begin', 'Donna', 'flat', 'show', 'off', 'what', 'sophisticated', 'thinker', 'old', 'friend', 'Al', 'Gore', 'documentary', 'Inconvenient', 'Truth', 'film', 'rented', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'prominently', 'book', 'case', 'Just', 'smart', 'comedic', 'acting', 'Horgan', 'speaking', 'words']",Pulling: Season 2

It's got physical comedy, verbal comedy, and situational comedy, all handled with equal aplomb and timing that's a marvel to watch.
