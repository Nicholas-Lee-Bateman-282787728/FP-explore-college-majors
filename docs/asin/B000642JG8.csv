858577,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B000642JG8,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[0, 0]","I didn't know too much about the story of the Ramones until I saw this documentary which is one of the best rock 'n roll documentaries--or just best documentaries period--I've seen. Anybody interested in just seeing an interesting film should check it out, but if you've loved the band you can't miss it. Like I said I didn't know much about the personal inside history of the band and so I had no idea how bad things got between Joey and Johnny as well as some of the other problems of other members. What the hell?? One reviewer proclaims the Ramones lived the punk rock lifesyle and that their story is not depressing. That's bulls###. Sorry their story IS depressing. And it's great and inspirational too. I wish for the Ramones they had found more happiness. Maybe the film's focus on the darker times and life on the road paints a somewhat misleading picture, but I doubt it. The film includes lots of great footage and interviews. Rob Zombie or someone remarks that over the years they looked exactly the same and seeing them you'd be like wondering what year it is. And god bless 'em for it. Needless to say they were one of a kind and it's too bad America failed to appreciate that more and, imo, it's too bad they cared.",5,the story of the Ramones,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,1230,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'Ramones', 'saw', 'documentary', 'one', 'best', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'documentaries', 'just', 'best', 'documentaries', 'period', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Anybody', 'interested', 'just', 'seeing', 'interesting', 'film', 'should', 'check', 'out', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'band', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'personal', 'inside', 'history', 'band', 'so', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'got', 'Joey', 'Johnny', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'problems', 'other', 'members', 'What', 'hell', 'One', 'reviewer', 'Ramones', 'lived', 'punk', 'rock', 'lifesyle', 'story', 'not', 'depressing', 'bulls', 'Sorry', 'story', 'depressing', 'great', 'inspirational', 'too', 'wish', 'Ramones', 'had', 'found', 'more', 'happiness', 'Maybe', 'film', 'focus', 'darker', 'times', 'life', 'road', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'picture', 'doubt', 'film', 'lots', 'great', 'footage', 'interviews', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'someone', 'remarks', 'years', 'looked', 'exactly', 'same', 'seeing', ""'d"", 'be', 'wondering', 'what', 'year', 'god', 'bless', 'Needless', 'say', 'were', 'one', 'kind', 'too', 'bad', 'America', 'failed', 'appreciate', 'more', 'imo', 'too', 'bad', 'cared']",N/A

858579,A1ZKPET0VDG25V,B000642JG8,"Arthur Bishop ""The Mechanic""","[5, 5]","that such an important band was so far away from success for the majority (or all, depending on your point of view) of their career.  How they could keep getting into that van day after day, year after year, feeling the way they did about one another, defies rational explanation.  They were SO GREAT, yet were IGNORED FOR SO LONG, that only in (or almost in) death did they receive even a fraction of the accolades they deserved.  As far as this DVD, it's not a lot of music really, but a sad, truthful look at one of the greatest rock and roll bands ever.  I found it mesmerizing, and depressing.  They influenced so many people in so many ways, yet hated each other for so many years.  And, as another reviewer notes, even in their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speeches, only the drummers thanked or mentioned any of the other members, even though Joey was already dead, and Dee Dee and Johnny would follow soon after.  And Johnny's mention of Bush was ill-timed and ill-placed, though not a surprise once you've seen this DVD.  Another reviewer mentioned having trouble hearing who wrote which songs on the first 3 albums (one of the special features).  I didn't have any problems hearing this, so as long as you have decent sound on your TV, you've got nothing to worry about.  I highly recommend this DVD, but not for the music, as there are only snippets.  Buy this for an inside look at how the band got started, and the very volatile relationships they had with one another.  Either way, the Ramones still stand as one of the most important bands in the history of music, from any genre, and of any time period.",5,Ironic...,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,1629,"['important', 'band', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'success', 'majority', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'career', 'How', 'could', 'keep', 'getting', 'van', 'day', 'day', 'year', 'year', 'feeling', 'way', 'did', 'one', 'rational', 'explanation', 'were', 'SO', 'GREAT', 'yet', 'were', 'IGNORED', 'FOR', 'SO', 'LONG', 'only', 'almost', 'death', 'did', 'receive', 'even', 'fraction', 'accolades', 'deserved', 'As', 'far', 'DVD', 'not', 'lot', 'music', 'really', 'sad', 'truthful', 'look', 'one', 'greatest', 'rock', 'roll', 'bands', 'ever', 'found', 'mesmerizing', 'depressing', 'influenced', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'yet', 'hated', 'other', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'reviewer', 'notes', 'even', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'acceptance', 'speeches', 'only', 'drummers', 'thanked', 'mentioned', 'other', 'members', 'even', 'Joey', 'was', 'already', 'dead', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'Johnny', 'would', 'follow', 'soon', 'Johnny', 'mention', 'Bush', 'was', 'ill-timed', 'ill-placed', 'not', 'surprise', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'having', 'trouble', 'hearing', 'who', 'wrote', 'songs', 'first', '3', 'albums', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'hearing', 'so', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'decent', 'sound', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'worry', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'not', 'music', 'are', 'only', 'snippets', 'Buy', 'inside', 'look', 'how', 'band', 'got', 'started', 'very', 'volatile', 'relationships', 'had', 'one', 'way', 'Ramones', 'still', 'stand', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'bands', 'history', 'music', 'genre', 'time', 'period']",N/A

There was a renaissance of the original Rock and Roll spirit, like the Ramones and Blondie, that Elvis & Jerry Lee esposed, but, of course, there was the efluvia like Television, Iggy Pop, Wayne/Jayne County - but THEY are even unnecessarily given ""fifteen minutes of fame"" here in ""End Of The Century.""  I don't need to tell you the story of the Ramones' ascent, their ""Sgt Pepper"" era (""Rock And Roll High School"") and their inevitible descent, the story is just too well known.

I was fortunate to have seen them live on three occasions in the eighties.  The operative word for a Ramones concert was FUN.  I saw ""End of the Century"" in the theatre last fall in full expectation of recapturing the joy of attending a Ramones show.  What I got was the equivalent of getting hit with a wet towel.  Who knew that the band who could give such highly professional entertainment harbored disillusionment and resentment?  Since recovering from the initial jolt I can view this DVD for what it is.  It is a thorough examination of the band's history, their influences, their artistry, and ultimately their place in the rock 'n' roll pantheon.  It is also an interesting study of the personality types of the individual band members and how that fueled their creativity.  Highly recommended for those who unfortunately never got to experience one of the greatest rock acts.  This DVD contains some deleted scenes that should not be missed.

True to ""punk ethics"", it pulls no punches, everything seems to be out there in the open. Probably the most shocking thing is that they loved the Bay City Rollers.Blondie represented the CBGB crew, Glen Matlock and Joe Strummer talk about how their music impacted England.Their original drummer/producer/manager Tommy offers a lot of insight to where they grew up (should be a historic landmark in Forest Hills!), other friends from the neighborhood, the music that influenced them, and what made them Ramones, and the various conflicts that threatened to break them up,worst of which was a love triangle between Johnny and Joey over a woman. You'll never hear ""The KKK Took My Baby Away"" the same.Phil Spector does get more than a short mention, they go into detail about the recording of ""End of the Century"". Put it this way, it doesn't help his case with Lana Clarkson...There's also the bitterness over why overseas they're treated like gods yet have to fight to play a club in the US, and in the 90s, why they still got no respect as a rock band while the Nirvanas and Pearl Jams eclipsed them. They kind of gloss over what happened in the 80s and 90s, although they do show Joey going into the hospital before he was in bad shape (Dee Dee already looked like he was on his way there..).I do wish they had interviewed Howard Stern who was a longtime friend of the band (who had no shortage of drunk Joey recordings), and was responsible for getting Johnny and Joey on speaking terms after leaving off on bitter terms in 96. The last time they had been together was for a CD signing of their anthology at Tower, something that would have been nice for this film. I don't remember seeing the Simpsons footage there, either...The extras are okay.The past couple of years has been good to Ramones fans though: Bizarre Tales which is a CD/DVD box set that includes the promo videos, and the ""Raw""and ""Rock and Roll High School"" DVDs.My recommendations to purchase with this film:Prereq: all the Ramones CDs, or the 2 CD anthology to cover the bases.The Filth and the Fury, Westway to the World, and Punk/Attitude.Books: ""On The Road with The Ramones"" by their former road manager and Dee Dee's 3 paperbacks ""Labotomy: Surviving the Ramones"", ""Chelsea Horror Hotel"", and ""Poison Heart"". Jim Bessman's ""American Band"" is also a decent overview of the band, and Legs Mc Neil's ""Please Kill Me"" is required reading for ""punk rock snob 101"".. in that case also pick up on CD the ""Nuggets"" box set, Love's ""Forever Changes"", Phil Spector's ""Back to Mono"", and Suicide's debut,  Television's ""Marquee Moon"", and everything (pre-reunion although the reunion stuff's not bad) by MC5, The Stooges, and the New York Dolls.",5,Irony of the title...,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,3436,"['as', 'soon', '21st', 'century', 'hit', '3', 'core', 'members', 'would', 'pass', 'away', '2001-2004.Joey', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'had', 'died', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'Johnny', 'stuck', 'around', 'long', 'enough', '30th', 'anniversary', 'tribute', 'film', 'be', 'completed.Thankfully', 'were', 'able', 'capture', 'combination', 'interviews', 'past', 'present', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'put', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'yet', 'left', 'so', 'much', 'something', 'Ramones', 'fans', 'would', 'say', 'setlist', 'come', 'think', ""'ve"", 'played', 'shorter', 'film', 'recommended', 'hardcore', 'Ramones', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'what', 'band', 'was', 'about', 'layers', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'band', 'True', 'punk', 'ethics', 'punches', 'everything', 'be', 'out', 'there', 'open', 'Probably', 'most', 'shocking', 'thing', 'loved', 'Bay', 'City', 'Rollers.Blondie', 'represented', 'CBGB', 'crew', 'Glen', 'Matlock', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'talk', 'how', 'music', 'impacted', 'England.Their', 'original', 'drummer/producer/manager', 'Tommy', 'lot', 'insight', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'should', 'be', 'historic', 'landmark', 'Forest', 'Hills', 'other', 'friends', 'neighborhood', 'music', 'influenced', 'what', 'made', 'Ramones', 'various', 'conflicts', 'threatened', 'break', 'up', 'worst', 'was', 'love', 'triangle', 'Johnny', 'Joey', 'woman', ""'ll"", 'never', 'hear', 'KKK', 'Took', 'My', 'Baby', 'Away', 'same.Phil', 'Spector', 'get', 'more', 'short', 'mention', 'go', 'detail', 'recording', 'End', 'Century', 'Put', 'way', ""n't"", 'help', 'case', 'Lana', 'Clarkson', 'also', 'bitterness', 'why', 'overseas', ""'re"", 'treated', 'gods', 'yet', 'have', 'fight', 'play', 'club', 'US', '90s', 'why', 'still', 'got', 'respect', 'rock', 'band', 'Nirvanas', 'Pearl', 'Jams', 'eclipsed', 'kind', 'gloss', 'what', 'happened', '80s', '90s', 'do', 'show', 'Joey', 'going', 'hospital', 'was', 'bad', 'shape', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'already', 'looked', 'was', 'way', 'there..', '.I', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'interviewed', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'who', 'was', 'longtime', 'friend', 'band', 'who', 'had', 'shortage', 'drunk', 'Joey', 'recordings', 'was', 'responsible', 'getting', 'Johnny', 'Joey', 'speaking', 'terms', 'leaving', 'off', 'bitter', 'terms', '96', 'last', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'together', 'was', 'CD', 'signing', 'anthology', 'Tower', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'Simpsons', 'footage', 'there', 'extras', 'are', 'okay.The', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'been', 'good', 'Ramones', 'fans', 'Bizarre', 'Tales', 'CD/DVD', 'box', 'set', 'promo', 'videos', 'Raw', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'High', 'School', 'DVDs.My', 'recommendations', 'purchase', 'film', 'Prereq', 'Ramones', 'CDs', '2', 'CD', 'anthology', 'cover', 'bases.The', 'Filth', 'Fury', 'Westway', 'World', 'Punk/Attitude.Books', 'Road', 'Ramones', 'former', 'road', 'manager', 'Dee', 'Dee', '3', 'paperbacks', 'Labotomy', 'Surviving', 'Ramones', 'Chelsea', 'Horror', 'Hotel', 'Poison', 'Heart', 'Jim', 'Bessman', 'American', 'Band', 'also', 'decent', 'overview', 'band', 'Legs', 'Mc', 'Neil', 'Please', 'Kill', 'Me', 'required', 'reading', 'punk', 'rock', 'snob', '101', '..', 'case', 'also', 'pick', 'up', 'CD', 'Nuggets', 'box', 'set', 'Love', 'Forever', 'Changes', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'Back', 'Mono', 'Suicide', 'debut', 'Television', 'Marquee', 'Moon', 'everything', 'pre-reunion', 'reunion', 'stuff', 'not', 'bad', 'MC5', 'Stooges', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls']",N/A

We've had a problem with past drummers and thought we might reconcile both of our fortunes.Cheers,Spinal TapP.S. Our amplifiers also go to eleven.Well, just finished watching this and all I can do is repeat what I said in an e-mail to 2/3 of the Electric Kisses (They're a Seattle band, both singers are really nice and fantastic songs, check 'em out.  Do it.  Do it.)  When Joey died, I was in a state that, well, I'm still in a state.  When Dee Dee died, it was more of an anticipated shock, really.  When Johnny died, I thought, ""Should have been him first.""  Seeing the late Mr. Cummings in this documentary, that has only increased.  In fact, if he weren't dead already, I'd pray for his demise.  What a EXPLETIVE DELETED.  There is nothing I can find that's decent about him, either his politics, his personality, or his guitar playing which was just Davie Allan (&lt;--buy anything by him you can)on 45 instead of 33 1/3 RPM, Davie Allan and the Chipmunks if you will... but I digress.Joey, Dee Dee, Tommy, Marky, Richie, and C.J. all got EXPLETIVE DELETED by him and it continued here as he seemed to get most of the screen time.Okay, on with the review.  If you read the Jim Bessman book already and Dee Dee's autobiography in either form, this is not going to contain anything astounding to you.  If you saw the PBS/BBC and/or Time-Life documentaries (a lot of repetition in terms of the interview footage of Joey from it is here) on the history of Rock n Roll, again, this is not going to be anything you don't already know about 1970s Punk.

I discovered it in 1978 in an article in the Wall Street Journal featuring Devo and Talking Heads. The article was so intriguing that I bought several records of both groups and I really enjoyed the music. As such, I started picking up recordings of other acts including the Ramones. The record I bought was ""End of The Century"" produced by Phil Spector. I chose that one because I had always enjoyed Spector's earlier work. Well, I almost wore the record out and I bought several other Ramones recordings. They were indeed excellent in a field that included many new and wonderful acts.At the time, I was not aware that the Ramones were at the base of the whole Punk Rock thing. That's very interesting and is well documented on ""The End of the Century"" DVD. It's a fascinating DVD to watch and I'm sure I'll view it again and again. It really takes you back to the 70s, and in a way that I particularly enjoy. They were unique times, that's for sure. I got into Punk Rock and it's musical cousin, New Wave, late and in San Diego, not NYC. Our local CBGB's was a place called ""The Skeleton Club"" and it featured three Punk bands every night for a nominal fee. Like the Ramones, they played their own original music. Some of the acts were excellent and you could see a very strong Ramones influence both in the looks and in the music. This DVD is really good for bringing all that memory back. Plus I love watching the Ramones in action.If you like the Ramones, you're going to like this DVD. To Make the experience even better, couple it with the ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" DVD featuring the Ramones.

But there's something really menacing in the story.Tommy (our last living original ramone) talks like a Rhodes Scholar next to the rest of the band - Johnny is unable to even crack a smile, the man is warped and perhaps necessarily so to keep the deal going.

Put simply, like Festival Express, this is a must see for 1) fans of the Ramones, 2) rock history buffs, 3) fans of rock music, period.  There, that should cover most folks who have stumbled on to this review.Unlike Festival Express, where the movie highlights were the performances, End has plenty of in-concert performances but is most interesting for the extensive and cross-cutting interviews with band members, managers, and people from other bands, most notably, the late Joe Strummer of Clash.  Stepping out from those stock bowl haircuts and black uniforms, the Ramones get in End a portrait that celebrates their individuality, their determination and their warts (Joey's inability to forgive, Johnny's often martinet leadership, DeeDee's willingness to abuse his body in every way imaginable -- and I would guess some unimaginable).  Along with the music, what comes through so strongly is their love for the group, if not for each other, and their work ethic -- in all their years they missed only one concert for band misbehavior and Johnny fired Marky over it.You watch End of the Century wondering how someone as sensitive as Joey ever lived at all, expecting DeeDee to have his overdose on screen in the middle of an interview, respecting Johnny's vision, even if often disagreeing with his methods.  And now they are all dead, making even more poignant that moment late in the movie when the off-screen interviewer asks, after Joey's death, Johnny if he felt something when Joey died. Pause.  And Johnny says, yes, he felt something, he felt bad all the week of Joey's death, even after not calling him while he was dying, not speaking for nearly two decades.  Why, probes the interviewer, why did you feel something?  Another pause, and then Johnny says because he was a Ramone, because he loved the Ramones, the group, the music. Moving stuff, moving and entertaining movie.P.S. Don't miss the swell moment when Debby Harry and Blondie are singing Heart of Glass in what looks like some bubble-machine disco set.

The documentary does an excellent job of charting their surprisingly long and turbulent career; and what a proud, pock-marked road it was, with Johnny valiantly trying to hold this band together when it looked like it would fall apart at the next road show.  Despite being one of the most influential bands in rock and roll music, the Ramones never got their due until they were inducted into the Hall of Fame two years after Joey's death.  Dee Dee following shortly thereafter.  It is eerie to see Joey and Dee Dee being interviewed as though they were still here.As informative as this documentary is, it lacks the energy that was so much a part of the Ramones.  I would have liked to have seen at least one of their songs played through to the end without the voice overs neatly filing away the performances in rock and roll history.  This band epitomized the dream of young pimply-faced teenage boys everywhere, showing that even if you were a total loser in high school you could find a way to express yourself, and in the case of the Ramones turn rock and roll on its ear, and usher in a new era of punk rock that had parents pulling out their hair.The Ramones were the real deal, unable to conform to record industry standards, never topping the charts, and never straying too far from their roots, except for Dee Dee who made an ill-advised turn into the rap music.  They found fame in the most unusual places, such as the streets of Rio, where Brazilian kids just about overturned their van on their way to a sold-out stadium concert; in contrast to the dive bars they continued to play in America.

858596,A2C5LA07JCDWTN,B000642JG8,"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line""","[5, 6]","End of the Century chronicles the Ramones from the bands genesis to the death of two of it's founding members. The inner relations of the band are touched on but not really mined too deeply. What you had in the case of the Ramones was three fiercly independent individuals each fighting for some semblance of control. Johnny comes across as nothing short of a dictator, forcing a sick Joey to continue the groups relentless touring schedule and stealing his girlfriend. Dee Dee also had some issues with John concerning his right to individualism (i.e. wearing something other than a black leather jacket and cutting his hair the way he wanted). Dee Dee was the backbone that held the group together as Joey and Johnny's relationship basically eroded to nothing. Dee Dee wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer but when it came to playing music live he was a legend. Dee Dee was basically a living cartoon character. What shocked me a little was John's callous response when asked if he regretted not contacting Joey as he lay dying, John replied ""Why would I...we didn't like each other...I mean I wouldn't want to hear from him if I was dying..."" Joey comes across as the most human of the Ramones, a shy outsider who found his voice in rock and roll. He was compassionate and sensitive and without a doubt the heart and soul of the band.  The directors take us through a segment from each of the groups albums including Marky and C.J. joining the band. The film does touch on Joey's death briefly and ends with Dee Dee walking away down a long hall way after the Hall of Fame induction, he would die less than two months later of a heroin overdose. Subsequently, Johnny also has passed from prostate cancer. So the three founding members of the Ramones are gone but their legacy lives in their music, differences aside these three guys single-handedly CREATED a new genre of music.

858597,A2XQELSTNMQAKJ,B000642JG8,"Jim Whittaker ""Rocky Horror fan""","[2, 2]","End of the Century deftly documents the story of the Ramones, the most important and influential punk band of all.  Through interviews with the then-surviving members and friends, furious live songs, and clips from a wide variety of vintage film and video sources, Gramaglia and Fields piece together the basic history of the band.  Hearing their story delivered by the band themselves (with New York accents) makes this an essential rock documentary.  Although some story elements are missing (Tommy's producer career isn't mentioned, nor is him and Monte Melnick booking the band's first show at Performance Studios), the film guides us through the band's early years and explains how radical their sound was at the time.  Radio stations wouldn't play their songs, they would give legendary shows in England only to return home to beg for club shows, and personal fights eventually ended Joey and Johnny's friendship, but through it all, they persevered and won.  The Clash's Joe Strummer quiets his basement interview at one point to listen to a rock song loudly playing two stories above, observing that the Ramones' influence is everywhere.  End of the Century preserves and celebrates an important part of America's musical history.  Joey, Johnny and Dee Dee may be gone, but the Ramones' legacy is too tough to die.

Martin ""Jeff Punk Rock Martin""","[0, 0]","There's a point in the Ramones documentary, ""End of the Century,"" in which Punk magazine alumnus Legs McNeil goes on a rant about the band's lack of commercial success. Referring to such should-have-been hits as ""Rockaway Beach"" and ""Sheena is a Punk Rocker,"" McNeil says, ""These songs were classic American pop. Why weren't they on the radio?""This, of course, encapsulates a major theme of the Ramones' career: one of the greatest rock & roll bands in history is left off the airwaves - and the sales charts - to make room for the likes of Toto, Journey and Styx. And it is, perhaps, at the very heart of the acrimony and general dysfunction that existed within the band for much of its 22-year career. After all, while drug problems, stolen girlfriends and emotional imbalance might be happily overlooked when you tour in jets and limos like the Rolling Stones, such issues probably tend to fester when you're crammed in a van right next to your junkie bassist, your girlfriend-stealing guitar player and your obsessive/compulsive lead singer.But, as we learn in ""End of the Century,"" such was life in the Ramones. We learn lots of other things too, in this first truly worthwhile documentary on the world's preeminent punk band. We see the grit and the glory of the band's early days at CBGB. The savage power of the Ramones onstage. The early hope and hunger for stardom...and the eventual realization that it just wasn't gonna happen. There are interviews and insights from the likes of Joe Strummer, Danny Fields, Deborah Harry, Jayne County, Seymour Stein and a host of other contemporaries and insiders. And along the way, Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee, Tommy, Marky, C.Jay, Richie and even Clem ""Elvis Ramone"" Burke share their war stories and thoughts on what it meant to bear punk's most hallowed surname. There's great stuff and amazing footage in here, and whether you know the story of the Ramones or not, you're bound to learn something new.To be sure, ""End of the Century"" has elements of tragedy. There's inner turmoil, unresolved animosity, lost love, addiction, and all the baggage that goes with living life just one hit single away from the big time. This, of course, in addition to the untimely deaths of the three primary Ramones. But the story of the Ramones is also a story of a band's dedication and work ethic...of keeping the faith and soldiering on against the odds, loving rock & roll, then walking off that stage on your own terms. ""End of the Century"" is the story of a band that became a legend through talent, originality and perseverence - with not a single lucky break along the way. It's a mindblowing, myth-wrecking, rock-loving documentary.

He was Blondie's drummer and had a few weekend gigs that according to Johny were 'disasters'.How the band felt about their fellow bandmates.Richie Ramone's side of the story.An argument onstage as to what to play next and Dee Dee accidently knocking over Joey's mike stand. This was all hilarious.Finally I have a lot of respect for Johny Ramone. He kept the band going as long as possible. I found it a little unnerving that during his acceptance speech into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame he didn't mention Joey, but praised George W. Bush. That made me sick.

It's still very good, but the Ramones deserved a documentary that was great.Like most rockumentary fare, the vast majority of this one is made up of cut and paste interview segments of most of the major players.  The interviews are sliced and diced to fit chronologically and create drama in the movie.  On the one hand, they did a very good job in editing these various clips.  On the other hand, the final result seems at times to be incomplete and sometimes even misleading.The performance clips are also sparsely sprinkled throughout, leaving much to be desired.

With Dee Dee's bass lines which you could actually heir, Johnny's shredded guitar sound, Joeys British-pop voice, Tommy's hard hitting drum technique, and the craziest lyrics you've ever heard. They are all combined to create a unique sound that made a new sound the media called ""Punk Rock"". What began as four delusional kids from ""Queens"" playing at an under budget Night Club ""CBGB's"", has now become the most influential band out there. Now here is the whole truth.  Jim Fields and Michael Gramaglia's who directed this film, have brought the dark side of the Ramones. It's all-true and it's all unseen. It could at times be very disturbing, depressing which is a side of the Ramones I've never seen. Ramones ""Raw shows the fun side of the Ramones which really isn't all of it. This is ten times better than that DVD. This documentary shows the hateful relationship between Joey and Johnny, Dee Dee's big drug problem, Marks drinking problems, it is all here. I didn't realize how dark the story of the Ramones was. But not the entire movie was dark. There were a lot of funny parts. Like one of the Ramones first show where Joey drops the microphone stand during ""California Sun"". The hardest I laughed in the film though was when they discuss Dee Dee's rap group. Interviews from all the band members, the interviews also include one of the last interviews of Joe Strummer from The Clash. Also I should include that this film is presented in widescreen 1:85I was really shocked to see there's no commentary track from the directors or any of the band members. The directors spent years making this film I'm they would have to say something. There are not much of any special features. New live performances, a behind the scene look of editing this film or something like that. But what you get in this DVD isn't bad though. I liked how in the booklet if you open it up it is the poster for the film. A small one though. There deleted scene titled ""Clem Burke as Elvis Ramone"". It also includes a Joey Ramone radio interview, Marky Ramone showing the Ramones drum style technique. Also extra interviews from Johnny, Richie and Dee Dee Ramone and Joe Strummer, Tommy Ramone's interview in Forest Hills, Debbie Harry & Chris Stein and Richie Adler. The thing I was really looking forward to was seeing Tommy Ramone explaining ""Who Wrote What on The First Three Albums"".

McGrath ""prmcgr""","[4, 7]","These guys deserved a decent documentary about the arc of their career, particularly Johnny (who somehow kept everyone together for 20 years) but the overall take is, actually, rather depressing.  Sure, these guys got into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame but, by the looks of it, were fairly miserable, angry and resentful every step of the way.  Dee Dee's on and off the horse; Joey is depressed, shy and jealous; Johnny's constantly trying to keep a lid on the powder keg of their collective egos, runs the band like an SS Oberfuhrer, and then shags the love of Joey's life, leaving a bitter scar that endures to his death from cancer at 49.  Jeez, the guy can't even express remorse over Joey's death and then, 3 weeks after they get into the Hall of Fame, Dee Dee's dead, from a heroine overdose.  Seems like these guys spent the better part of their youth being wasted or pissed off at each other (particularly the latter), relentlessly.The honesty, and humanity, of the band does shine through: I never thought I'd ever care about the Ramones or their music until I saw this engrossing film.Contrary to some of the other reviews, I thought the producers sampled a lot of what made the Ramones' music halfway decent, especially the early days.  The problem with three chord rock, however, is that there are only so many variations on that theme, and the Ramones sounded like a broken record with their first LP.  Their live act was apparently the bomb and I wish I could have looked past my own stupid prejudices and seen these guys live when I had the chance.

The footage and photos evoke a nostalgia for a time that, if you lived through it, was gritty to say the least. The interviews are insightful and, unlike most documentaries, relevant to what was being discussed. (It was disheartening, however, to count the number of DOAs among the interviewees: DeeDee, Joey, Johnny, Joe Strummer, Linda Stein, etc.)Some reviewers have said that the band comes off sort of whiny, as does Legs O'Neill. But think about it: is it whiny when the complaint is legitimate? The Pistols and other bands heaped the term ""punk"" on a band that had nothing to do with that scene musically. They didn't spike their hair, they were apolitical for the most part, and they wanted to be close to the mainstream. Their success wasn't all that great but, come on, as the movie clearly shows, they could have broken up at any time and still laugh all the way to the bank.One thing did bother me--not about the film but about the band--that at the Rock and Roll induction ceremonies which bookend the film, only Tommy had the class to thank and include Joey in his acceptance speech. DeeDee's patting himself on the back, while typical, depressed me.

858614,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B000642JG8,Tom Birkenstock,"[15, 20]","There are two kinds of geniuses: those who forge their intelligence through hard work and those who have a frighteningly precocious intuition. The Ramones had the latter. Somehow they managed adapt such gimmicks as replacing their last names with ""Ramone"" and all adopting a faux-fifties look and still seem one-hundred percent genuine. How a bunch of glue sniffers from Queens managed to create retro, yet revolutionary, American music is anybody's guess. End of the Century never broaches the question of inspiration (although they do tell the stories behind several of their songs), and instead focuses on the drama of interband turmoil. As Dee Dee Ramone says, echoing ACDC, ""it's not easy being in a rock and roll band.""The interesting thing about The Ramones is that their music managed to be both retro and forward thinking. Tommy Ramone described their music as ""futuristic."" If you look at any of the retro sounding bands out there, from the 80's revival to the well renowned Shins, virtually none of them are able to move rock music forward. In fact, the best of them sound as if they're a really good band from a couple decades ago. You can make some great music working within older genres, but only geniuses are able to reshape old songs into a completely new genre. The Ramones were somehow able to make music that drew from the past, but updated it so you felt the same energy kids in the 1950's must have felt when they first heard Buddy Holly on the Jukebox. The secret of The Ramones is that using the old blueprint just isn't enough; you have to update the music in a way that speaks to an audience twenty-years later.Like all famous rock bands since The Beatles, each member of The Ramones had a distinct niche: Joey was the innocent one; Tommy business minded and a bit too adult for the band (probably why he left early on); Dee Dee a jester and a thug; and Johnny...well, Johnny was a jerk. One of the centerpieces of the Ramones story is the feud between Joey and Johnny. As The Ramones were starting out Joey was the hopeless romantic responsible for most of The Ramones' love songs. He was also fighting an almost terminal case of shyness. It was around this time that Johnny stole his girlfriend from him. Joey held a grudge against Johnny for the rest of their career. The liberal Joey even wrote ""The KKK Took My Baby Away"" attacking the creepily conservative Johnny (at the rock and roll hall of fame induction Johnny thanks George W. Bush).If you're looking for a pick me up End of the Century is not it. Johnny, Dee Dee, and Joey all passed away in the last few years. Despite twenty years of hard work The Ramones were unable to become as successful in America as they had hoped, and looked forlornely across the Atlantic as punk exploded in England.The shy, OCD, and often physically sick Joey is really the heart of the story. Before The Ramones, Joey was withdrawn and barely able to handle his obsessive compulsive disorder. He even checked himself into a hospital in hopes of stopping voices that made him repeat words. When he become the frontman for The Ramones he was able to build the confidence needed to rejoin the world. Joey even manages to stand up to the domineering Johnny. The story of the introvert who becomes an inspiration to millions is an unlikely testament to the power of music. What would Joey's life have been like had he never been a Ramone? Would he have returned to the hospital? While End of the Century puts down that pesky rumor about how easy rock and roll is, I have a feeling the music gave Joey a life he couldn't have lived otherwise. He was also generous enough to share that music with the rest of the world. What would the world be like without the music of The Ramones?

It was a great time, and we felt a fine way to pay our respects to one of rocks finest.Now they're all dead. Except for Marky, I think. Within like three years or something like that. It seems like yesterday we were still talking about them touring. WHAT HAPPENED?I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released at a midnight matinee. It was really friggin' good. I never knew the complexities of the Ramones story before seeing this highly informative, highly rocking documentary. The main focus is on the early days, and how The Ramones changed the underground rock culture and brought it to the light. Also, how they remained true to their roots always, even when the rest of their punk brothers and sisters moved into the mainsteam. The Ramones were truly an amazing group of punks, and they kept it real for years. The film follows them right up untill their deaths at the, end of the century. Interveiws from all the members, plus Joe Strummer and Debbie Harry.If you like 'em, or just like punk rock, or even just like well done rock docs... this one is well worth a veiw.(...)",5,HEY HO LETS GO....

858617,A4OSXRZR2BMX8,B000642JG8,"William Merrill ""eclecticist""","[20, 22]","The Ramones' music sounds eternal to me.  It is raw power, ""white heat,"" as Joe Strummer describes it during this excellent documentary.  This release takes on added meaning after the passing of two Ramones, but it's more than just the story of one particular legendary band.  It's about the early days of American punk, the CBGB's scene of the late '70s, and even the essence of rock n roll itself.  Thru it all is the mighty music of a band that stands as an icon for the last century and will do so into the future.  Besides all of that high falutin' stuff, though, End of the Century is just a fascinating documentary to watch.  I got totally engrossed in the origins of the group, their rise to glory, the various in-fighting and love-hate relationships within the band, etc.  The extras with the DVD are pretty good too, although a little more care could have gone into their presentation.  For example, the short feature on ""Who wrote what"" with Tommy Ramone is fun, but an off-camera interviewer names the songs in a barely audible voice while Tommy says who wrote them.  How hard would it have been to run the song titles on the screen as Tommy named the writers for each of them?  Instead it's nearly impossible to hear some of the titles as the interviewer softly calls them out.",5,Rock n roll will never die,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1290,"['Ramones', 'music', 'eternal', 'raw', 'power', 'white', 'heat', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'release', 'added', 'meaning', 'passing', 'two', 'Ramones', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'one', 'particular', 'legendary', 'band', 'early', 'days', 'American', 'punk', 'CBGB', 'scene', 'late', ""'70s"", 'even', 'essence', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'Thru', 'mighty', 'music', 'band', 'icon', 'last', 'century', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'future', 'high', 'falutin', 'stuff', 'though', 'End', 'Century', 'just', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'watch', 'got', 'totally', 'engrossed', 'origins', 'group', 'rise', 'glory', 'various', 'in-fighting', 'love-hate', 'relationships', 'band', 'etc', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'little', 'more', 'care', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'presentation', 'example', 'short', 'feature', 'Who', 'wrote', 'what', 'Tommy', 'Ramone', 'fun', 'off-camera', 'interviewer', 'songs', 'barely', 'audible', 'voice', 'Tommy', 'who', 'wrote', 'How', 'hard', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'run', 'song', 'titles', 'screen', 'Tommy', 'named', 'writers', 'Instead', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'hear', 'titles', 'interviewer', 'softly', 'out']",N/A
