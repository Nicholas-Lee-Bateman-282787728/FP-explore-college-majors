We professionally make instructional videos for my wife's small business and have used Sony Vegas for many years (we are onSony Vegas Pro 9and also useSony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10 Suite). This video is relevant for all of the most recent versions of Vegas.This video is divided into chapters for easy navigation and includes the promised ""Tips & Tricks"" but also a very useful section on customizing the ""Preferences"" to make the workflow smoother (at least for me).Each concept is covered with video examples and a walkthrough of the required steps to achieve the result. The videos are mostly short and to the point, but thoroughly cover the concept being shown.The real value of the DVD is that it even if you don't need a particular ""Trick"", watching all of it will give you an idea of the true power of Vegas and will give you ideas on how to get the most out of it on future projects.Highly Recommended!CFH",5,Very Helpful Aid For Vegas Users - Highly Recommended,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,1057,"['Bill', 'Myers', 'produced', 'many', 'good', 'Vegas', 'tutorials', 'one', '101', 'Tips', 'Tricks', 'Sony', 'Movie', 'Studio', 'also', 'great', 'collection', 'professionally', 'make', 'instructional', 'videos', 'wife', 'small', 'business', 'have', 'used', 'Sony', 'Vegas', 'many', 'years', 'are', 'onSony', 'Vegas', 'Pro', '9and', 'also', 'useSony', 'Vegas', 'Movie', 'Studio', 'HD', 'Platinum', '10', 'Suite', 'video', 'relevant', 'most', 'recent', 'versions', 'Vegas.This', 'video', 'divided', 'chapters', 'easy', 'navigation', 'promised', 'Tips', 'Tricks', 'also', 'very', 'useful', 'section', 'customizing', 'Preferences', 'make', 'workflow', 'smoother', 'least', '.Each', 'concept', 'covered', 'video', 'examples', 'walkthrough', 'required', 'steps', 'achieve', 'result', 'videos', 'are', 'mostly', 'short', 'point', 'thoroughly', 'cover', 'concept', 'being', 'shown.The', 'real', 'value', 'DVD', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'particular', 'Trick', 'watching', 'will', 'give', 'idea', 'true', 'power', 'Vegas', 'will', 'give', 'ideas', 'how', 'get', 'most', 'future', 'projects.Highly', 'Recommended', 'CFH']",101 Tips & Tricks for Sony Movie Studio - updated for Movie Studio 11

1285006,A3102RL8MM5J2Z,B002R1X5AM,Jim Lively,"[0, 0]","This was an extremely valuable purchase for me. I wasn't getting the kind of help I needed from the vegas software tutorials, so I bought 101 Tips and it is worth every penny (and not too many of those, at that.) Mr. Myers lessons helped me master green screen projects, flying windows, the development of unusual and exciting titles, and many other video enhancements; plus, provided pointers on getting my workspace back to its normal reset after I somehow managed to lose palettes. He doesn't stop with the single lesson, either, as he repeats the steps for each lesson before signing off. I try something new every day. It has made Vegas as easy and accessible as the older software I used to use. It truly is as he says in his sign offs - ""easy if you know the trick.""",5,extremely helpful,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,773,"['was', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'purchase', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'kind', 'help', 'needed', 'vegas', 'software', 'tutorials', 'bought', '101', 'Tips', 'worth', 'penny', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'Mr.', 'Myers', 'helped', 'master', 'green', 'screen', 'projects', 'flying', 'windows', 'development', 'unusual', 'exciting', 'titles', 'many', 'other', 'video', 'enhancements', 'provided', 'pointers', 'getting', 'workspace', 'back', 'normal', 'reset', 'somehow', 'managed', 'lose', 'palettes', ""n't"", 'stop', 'single', 'lesson', 'either', 'steps', 'lesson', 'signing', 'off', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'day', 'made', 'Vegas', 'easy', 'accessible', 'older', 'software', 'used', 'use', 'truly', 'sign', 'offs', 'easy', 'know', 'trick']",101 Tips & Tricks for Sony Movie Studio - updated for Movie Studio 11
1285007,A37EQD5OIXRNSG,B002R1X5AM,Phil Buglass,"[1, 1]","When I received this, I noticed that it was actually written for Sony Vegas, and not Sony Platinum.  I contacted the seller before opening the case, to say that I may need to return it if not suitable.  She told me to go ahead and try it out.  She responded very quickly, too.Anyway, I watched a few of the 'lessons' last night.  The program has a slightly different interface to the later product, but there is only so many things you can do with a NLE program, after all!  I have no problems associating the lessons with the program I have.  You do need to be aware of the issue, though.  As a total newbie to the editing scene - I am still playing with the free trial while I await delivery of my regular copy - the lessons are very helpful.  He explains things thoroughly, but without &#34;talking down&#34; to the viewer.  The videos are broken up into a whole bunch of lessons, most of which seem to be 2 or 3 minutes in length.  It was easy to pause the video while I jumped across to my program and tried out what he was explaining.  Apart from one item, everything in mine worked just as his did, and I suspect the one that didn't was user error.  I need to go back and make sure I wasn't doing something wrong somewhere.The lessons I watched so far would probably be considered really basic by anyone who has a bit more experience with the editing stuff.  I have not watched any of the lessons with the 'tricks' just yet, so  I don't know if they would be a lot more advanced.  The sound and picture quality are both very good.I would certainly recommend this to anyone starting out, even with the different screen interface between the programs.",4,Based on earlier product,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1656,"['When', 'received', 'noticed', 'was', 'actually', 'written', 'Sony', 'Vegas', 'not', 'Sony', 'Platinum', 'contacted', 'seller', 'opening', 'case', 'say', 'may', 'need', 'return', 'not', 'suitable', 'told', 'go', 'ahead', 'try', 'out', 'responded', 'very', 'quickly', 'too.Anyway', 'watched', 'few', ""'lessons"", 'last', 'night', 'program', 'slightly', 'different', 'interface', 'later', 'product', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'NLE', 'program', 'have', 'problems', 'associating', 'lessons', 'program', 'have', 'do', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'issue', 'though', 'total', 'newbie', 'editing', 'scene', 'am', 'still', 'playing', 'free', 'trial', 'await', 'delivery', 'regular', 'copy', 'lessons', 'are', 'very', 'helpful', 'things', 'thoroughly', '34', 'talking', 'down', '34', 'viewer', 'videos', 'are', 'broken', 'up', 'whole', 'bunch', 'lessons', 'most', 'seem', 'be', '2', '3', 'minutes', 'length', 'was', 'easy', 'pause', 'video', 'jumped', 'program', 'tried', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'explaining', 'Apart', 'one', 'item', 'everything', 'mine', 'worked', 'just', 'did', 'suspect', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'user', 'error', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'make', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'something', 'wrong', 'somewhere.The', 'lessons', 'watched', 'so', 'far', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'considered', 'really', 'basic', 'anyone', 'who', 'bit', 'more', 'experience', 'editing', 'stuff', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'lessons', ""'tricks"", 'just', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'advanced', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good.I', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'starting', 'out', 'even', 'different', 'screen', 'interface', 'programs']",101 Tips & Tricks for Sony Movie Studio - updated for Movie Studio 11
1285008,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B002R1X5AM,Scott FS,"[7, 7]","Bill Myers is well-known in some circles for his expertise in digital editing.  For example, he has his own website, and a channel on Youtube.  Here, Myers puts 101 Tips, Tricks and Techniques on a single DVD for those of us who know pretty much nothing about digital editing.He is a good teacher.  Each Tip (if I can call these video segments that) is about 1:30 to 5:00 minutes or so.  Most are in the 1-3 minute range.Sony Movie Studio is not an expensive editing software, as these things go.  The cost for the least expensive version is just a hair over twenty dollars.  The next step up is the Platinium version, which is about four times that cost, but well under a C-note.As it comes from Sony, Movie Studio is extremely light on instructions.  In fact, there's no printed owner's guide or instruction manual.  There are very limited tutorials that one can follow, from within the program, but it's really just limited and simple information.  Sony leaves the door open to educational efforts such as Myers.  It's a shame, really, that Sony can't include a 40 or so page manual to get you started on Movie Studio, but they don't.Strongly recommended.  Myers covers most of the basics, and he assumes the user knows very little about the program.  He starts from ground zero, and helps you learn from there.Why not five stars?  I find the organizational structure to be a little lacking.  There is no logical progression between subjects.  I do know that Myers has a previous DVD called ""Editing How-to Videos with Sony Vegas Movie Studio"" that came out a couple of years prior to the release of this instructional disc.  Perhaps that covers all of the basics.  However, it would have been nicer if the book were laid out a bit more logically.",4,Great tips and tricks for Sony Movie Studio,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,1750,"['Bill', 'Myers', 'well-known', 'circles', 'expertise', 'digital', 'editing', 'example', 'own', 'website', 'channel', 'Youtube', 'Here', 'Myers', '101', 'Tips', 'Tricks', 'Techniques', 'single', 'DVD', 'who', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'digital', 'editing.He', 'good', 'teacher', 'Tip', 'can', 'call', 'video', 'segments', 'about', '1:30', '5:00', 'minutes', 'so', 'Most', 'are', '1-3', 'minute', 'range.Sony', 'Movie', 'Studio', 'not', 'expensive', 'editing', 'software', 'things', 'go', 'cost', 'least', 'expensive', 'version', 'just', 'hair', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'next', 'step', 'up', 'Platinium', 'version', 'four', 'times', 'cost', 'well', 'C-note.As', 'Sony', 'Movie', 'Studio', 'extremely', 'light', 'instructions', 'fact', 'printed', 'owner', 'guide', 'instruction', 'manual', 'are', 'very', 'limited', 'tutorials', 'one', 'can', 'follow', 'program', 'really', 'just', 'limited', 'simple', 'information', 'Sony', 'door', 'open', 'educational', 'efforts', 'such', 'Myers', 'shame', 'really', 'Sony', 'ca', ""n't"", 'include', '40', 'so', 'page', 'manual', 'get', 'started', 'Movie', 'Studio', ""don't.Strongly"", 'recommended', 'Myers', 'most', 'basics', 'user', 'very', 'little', 'program', 'ground', 'zero', 'learn', 'there.Why', 'not', 'five', 'stars', 'find', 'organizational', 'structure', 'be', 'little', 'lacking', 'logical', 'progression', 'subjects', 'do', 'know', 'Myers', 'previous', 'DVD', 'called', 'Editing', 'How-to', 'Videos', 'Sony', 'Vegas', 'Movie', 'Studio', 'came', 'out', 'couple', 'years', 'prior', 'release', 'instructional', 'disc', 'Perhaps', 'basics', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nicer', 'book', 'were', 'laid', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'logically']",101 Tips & Tricks for Sony Movie Studio - updated for Movie Studio 11
