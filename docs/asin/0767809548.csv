The mores of the time are depicted in the generational 'hiccups.' Upon first viewing, this is an obtuse, roadblock. The movie seems to start/stop, and introduce new characters.The rotocoped performances by Roz Kelly, and others, along with permission from BOB SEGAR to use his actual voice...[did anyone really notice when, SOMEBODY TO LOVE by Jefferson Airplane, was a COVER?]for a fictional character. Bob Dylan, having allowed the fictional character to ""WRITE"" a hit or two of his, is ANOTHER PLUS.The Music of AMERICAN POP, is well, broad, and somewhat comprehensive. From the popular, for its day, Maple Leaf Rag, to the popular, at the time the movie was released, Night Moves, sweeps along, period by period, as the absentee/rogue/and scoundrel fathers do their best, for the times...THEY live in. All with a musical talent. From a CANTOR, in Russia, through vaudeville, WW II, Rebelious 50's, The BEAT Generation, the Flower POP of the '60s, the drug counter-culture, Hard Rock, and even PUNK. WHEW! IF you like a broad spectrum of music, LIKE I DO, Then The SCRAWNY SOUNDTRACK ALBUM [compared to the sweeping and VAST music, actually in the film.] is a bit of a let-down. Single LP? ""C'mon, I'm Dyin' here!""The heart-wrenching scene where a strung-out heroine freak, realizes he's just met his illegitimate son, and then is too weak to kick the habit...Though he really wishes he could, is more raw and edgy, than mainstream animation has NEVER before tackled.My only disappointment on viewing/multiple viewing, is some registration errors in the original film, loused up a couple of parts. The overall animation is slow vintage, in the early part, 101 Dalmations-esque, in the Beat Generation section, and Wild and MOD, in the final section. [With EVERYTHING in between, I should add.]THIS is almost an AUTOBIOGRAPHY of RALPH BAKSHI. [As much as PECKER, is an Autobiography of John Waters, anyway] He is of partial-Eastern Europe/Jewish descent, and is in a ART FORM, much like music. His early SPIDERMAN TV SERIES work, was 180-ed, when he then, released, the ""X"" rated [really!] FRITZ The CAT. I don't see Disney going THAT far, though I do find Disney's ""Potty Humor, requirement, just plain 'DUMB BUSINESS.'The REASON, I mention Disney, is that it was Surprising to see, ROY DISNEY's name drift up the credits. [Ya, gotta remember, Don BLUTH, long-time Disney animator, defected, and created LAND BEFORE TIME, and SECRET OF NIHM, about this period, to appreciate ROY DISNEY's position.]A fun little cameo of RICHARD (Night Court) MOLL as the tortured beat poet [doing an Allen Ginsberg piece,] is both true to the times, and another turning point where the WORDS are flip-flopped with TUNES as the important talent.The GENES of a RABBI-Cantor singer, a songwriter, a piano player, a hippy lyricist, all combine to the WRITER/PERFORMER artist of the final STADIUM ROCK performance, finding the stardom...each of the previous 'POPs' had hoped their son could attain.Bless you, Ralph.",5,"AMERICAN POP: Popular Music, and Fatherhood",1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,3103,"['storyline', 'BLOODLINE', 'Jewish', 'immigrants', 'Czarist', 'Russia', 'DEVO', 'counterculture', 'mores', 'time', 'are', 'depicted', 'generational', ""'hiccups"", 'first', 'viewing', 'obtuse', 'roadblock', 'movie', 'start/stop', 'introduce', 'new', 'characters.The', 'rotocoped', 'performances', 'Roz', 'Kelly', 'others', 'permission', 'BOB', 'SEGAR', 'use', 'actual', 'voice', '[', 'did', 'anyone', 'really', 'notice', 'when', 'SOMEBODY', 'TO', 'LOVE', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'was', 'COVER', ']', 'fictional', 'character', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'having', 'allowed', 'fictional', 'character', 'WRITE', 'hit', 'two', 'ANOTHER', 'PLUS.The', 'Music', 'AMERICAN', 'POP', 'well', 'broad', 'somewhat', 'comprehensive', 'popular', 'day', 'Maple', 'Leaf', 'Rag', 'popular', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Night', 'Moves', 'along', 'period', 'period', 'absentee/rogue/and', 'scoundrel', 'fathers', 'do', 'best', 'times', 'THEY', 'live', 'musical', 'talent', 'CANTOR', 'Russia', 'vaudeville', 'WW', 'II', 'Rebelious', '50', 'BEAT', 'Generation', 'Flower', 'POP', ""'60s"", 'drug', 'counter-culture', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'even', 'PUNK', 'WHEW', 'IF', 'like', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'music', 'LIKE', 'DO', 'Then', 'SCRAWNY', 'SOUNDTRACK', 'ALBUM', '[', 'compared', 'sweeping', 'VAST', 'music', 'actually', 'film', ']', 'bit', 'let-down', 'Single', 'LP', ""C'mon"", ""'m"", 'Dyin', 'here', 'heart-wrenching', 'scene', 'where', 'strung-out', 'heroine', 'freak', 'just', 'met', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'then', 'too', 'weak', 'kick', 'habit', 'really', 'could', 'more', 'raw', 'edgy', 'mainstream', 'animation', 'NEVER', 'tackled.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'viewing/multiple', 'viewing', 'registration', 'errors', 'original', 'film', 'loused', 'up', 'couple', 'parts', 'overall', 'animation', 'slow', 'vintage', 'early', 'part', '101', 'Dalmations-esque', 'Beat', 'Generation', 'section', 'Wild', 'MOD', 'final', 'section', '[', 'EVERYTHING', 'should', 'add', ']', 'THIS', 'almost', 'AUTOBIOGRAPHY', 'RALPH', 'BAKSHI', 'As', 'much', 'PECKER', 'Autobiography', 'John', 'Waters', 'anyway', 'partial-Eastern', 'Europe/Jewish', 'descent', 'ART', 'FORM', 'much', 'music', 'early', 'SPIDERMAN', 'TV', 'SERIES', 'work', 'was', '180-ed', 'when', 'then', 'released', 'X', 'rated', '[', 'really', ']', 'FRITZ', 'CAT', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Disney', 'going', 'THAT', 'far', 'do', 'find', 'Disney', 'Potty', 'Humor', 'requirement', 'just', 'plain', ""'DUMB"", 'BUSINESS', 'REASON', 'mention', 'Disney', 'was', 'Surprising', 'see', 'ROY', 'DISNEY', 'name', 'up', 'credits', '[', 'Ya', 'got', 'ta', 'remember', 'Don', 'BLUTH', 'long-time', 'Disney', 'animator', 'defected', 'created', 'LAND', 'BEFORE', 'TIME', 'SECRET', 'OF', 'NIHM', 'period', 'appreciate', 'ROY', 'DISNEY', 'position', ']', 'fun', 'little', 'cameo', 'RICHARD', 'Night', 'Court', 'MOLL', 'tortured', 'beat', 'poet', '[', 'doing', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'piece', ']', 'true', 'times', 'turning', 'point', 'where', 'WORDS', 'are', 'flip-flopped', 'TUNES', 'important', 'talent.The', 'GENES', 'RABBI-Cantor', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'piano', 'player', 'hippy', 'lyricist', 'combine', 'WRITER/PERFORMER', 'artist', 'final', 'STADIUM', 'ROCK', 'performance', 'finding', 'stardom', 'previous', 'had', 'hoped', 'son', 'could', 'attain.Bless', 'Ralph']",N/A

9902,AUDIJM3VUULS7,0767809548,Charles Tatum,"[5, 15]","""American Pop"" is Ralph Bakshi's best film...that's not saying much considering this man also assaulted us with ""Fritz the Cat,"" the animated ""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""Wizards,"" and the really awful ""Hey Good Lookin'.""The story follows four generations of a Russian immigrant family, and their cosmic involvement in their respective worlds of popular music. Jimmy is a vaudevillian who gets shot in the throat in WWI and must manage the career of his singer wife. He also gets involved with the mob thanks to prohibition. His son, Benny, is a piano genius who is killed is WWII. Benny's son is the misfit Tony, who we follow from the Beat generation to a drug induced 1970's. Tony's one night stand product, Pete, continues the drug trade, but can belt out one mean tune in the punk rock late 1970's.Bakshi's animation still consists of tracing live action onto film as animated subjects. This makes for some really jerky scenes, although not on the headache inducing level of his earlier work. There are a few places where the work is downright interesting, like Tony's acid trip and eventual fall from a stage, and Pete's dancelike movements as he delivers his drugs to his customers.Bakshi's biggest mistake is using well known songs in the soundtrack, and attributing them to cartoon characters. Pete writes ""Night Moves."" Benny comes up with ""As Time Goes By"" after stealing the riff from a hobo. Tony wrote ""Somebody to Love."" I found this angle of the film irritating. It is not like no one has ever heard of these songs, and would be fooled. It just seems as if the film makers were too lazy to come up with their own material, and the songwriters and publishing houses were too eager to sell their stuff for a quick buck. Since the entire film consists of this one family coming up with all the great songs of the last eighty years, toss any suspense out the window as to what each generation is going to accomplish.Bakshi is also obsessed with the illegal drug culture in the final half of the film. What is this, ""Panic in Needle Park""? Watching cartoon characters shooting heroin is bizarre, but pointless. I ask the same question I ask of some of Bakshi's other work, specifically ""Hey Good Lookin',"" why did he animate this? Why didn't he shoot this with live actors? The animation, while interesting, is completely unwarranted.In the end, ""American Pop"" is as homogenized and half baked as much of the music coming out today. Then again, I'd rather watch Britney Spears cavort in low riding jeans than sit through this music mondo mockumentary again.

This is a film for adults: drugs, prostitution, poverty, politics, and bloodshed are just some things that little kids will NEVER understand. But the film also has a good story: we get to see different generations of popular music (from the late 1890's to the 1980's) seen through the eyes of a Russian-Jewish family. It's an effective story, and same goes for the stunning (and diverse) animation. Much of the animation is colorful, realistic, and at times wildly bizarre (at least in the later half of the film). The one problem I had with American Pop is that sometimes it doesn't really feel like an animated film at all. Some sections in the film (particularly scenes with extended dialogue) could have worked better if they were live-action. Still, the film is an underrated gem. The adult story, the animation, the music, the dialogue, much of the film is undeniably solid.Grade: 8/10",4,Terribly UNDERRATED,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,1131,"['never', 'seen', 'animated', 'film', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'now', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'American', 'Pop', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'exact', 'opposite', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'way', 'film', 'adults', 'drugs', 'prostitution', 'poverty', 'politics', 'bloodshed', 'are', 'just', 'things', 'little', 'kids', 'will', 'NEVER', 'understand', 'film', 'also', 'good', 'story', 'get', 'see', 'different', 'generations', 'popular', 'music', 'late', '1890', '1980', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Russian-Jewish', 'family', 'effective', 'story', 'same', 'stunning', 'diverse', 'animation', 'Much', 'animation', 'colorful', 'realistic', 'times', 'wildly', 'bizarre', 'least', 'later', 'half', 'film', 'one', 'problem', 'had', 'American', 'Pop', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'animated', 'film', 'sections', 'film', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'extended', 'dialogue', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'were', 'live-action', 'Still', 'film', 'underrated', 'gem', 'adult', 'story', 'animation', 'music', 'dialogue', 'much', 'film', 'undeniably', 'solid.Grade', '8/10']",N/A

Once again Bakshi probes the sordid underbelly of his subject, in this case pop music, but nothing here ever comes off quite convincing enough. And his dismissal of punk and rush to embrace the bland beardo post-hippie commercial rock of Bob Seger and Heart betrays Bakshi's age, and maybe a lack of good taste as well. It comes off a bit old-fogeyish.Like a lot of Bakshi's work, this has to be taken as it is, and the viewer has to bear in mind when and how it was made.  Computer animation was in its infancy, and animation was at a low point in the United States, so the fact that this was made and distributed in mainstream theaters at all was a minor miracle at the time.In short, the musical spots provide the bright moments, but the plot is labored and the characters, particularly the ridiculous &quot;rock star&quot; he invents at the end of the film, are unconvincing.

The reviewers here and elsewhere have taken a lot of time arguing that point, what inaccuracies there were in the timeline, the shallowness of some of the characters, which musical movements have been misrepresented and which have been completely neglected. But the fact of the matter is, Bakshi did an amazing job on this project, in the aspects of both the animation and the film's historical scope. What he actually did here, is tell the history of American popular music from the beginning of the century (Vaudeville) to the late 1970's (Punk) in 97 minutes, through the story of four generations in one family. Naturally, it doesn't cover every musical style existing in this period, and there are bound to be those who are insulted, but essentially American Pop covers all the important ground and he shows true sensitivity and understanding of the subject.Bakshi, who started his career as a strictly commercial animator throughout the 1960's, spent his rather brief highly creative period - from the mid-70's to the early 80's - continually trying to prove that the Disney way - though he obviously held it in great esteem - was far from being the only way of making animation, and like Wizards, Fritz The Cat and Lord of the Rings among others (the latter two, by the way, are mediocre movies that do little justice to their source material but are fascinating artistically) in American Pop he did things never seen in animation before. These works came years before the work of independent animators like Jan Svankmajer became known in the US, and a long time before the existence and huge success of independent, artistic, commercial animators like Nick Park and Bill Plympton, and Bakshi's films, while they were firmly grounded in his commercial roots, they were also amazingly original and years ahead of their time. The differences in atmosphere and feel in the different periods of time shown in the film - from the 1920's through the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's - are fascinating and very creative and the characters, though drawn rather simplistically, have enormous personality and emotional strength, an you are drawn into the film and moved like only few animated films can move.Like his other works, American Pop never had a hope of achieving commercial success, but today it functions both as a fantastic film and a fascinating historic artifact. It's essential, of course, for fans of Ralph Bakshi's, but is also well recommended to anyone interested in animation, be it commercial or artistic, and in animation history, as well as anyone interested in the history of pop music in the broadest sense. American Pop may be simplistic at times, but it's never dumbed down, and great care and thought was put into every word, every movement, every facial expression and mostly every musical note.

Upon arriving in America his mother is killed in a sweatshop fire, and Zalmie is left to the streets of New York. Zalmie finds his place in the world on Vaudeville, at first distributing chorus slips to customers so they can sing along, then he moves up the Vaudeville ropes to singer. During a USO show in WWI France there's a German attack and Zalmie is wounded in the throat, ending his dream of being a singer. He returns to Vaudeville, becomes a comedian and meets the girl of his dreams, a stripper. Zalmie tries to turn her into a star but life intervenes again, she gets pregnant and Zalmie needing to earn a living falls in with the mob.Zalmie's ambitions are resurrected in his son Benny a talented piano player, but Benny would rather play with a negro Jazz band than seriously pursue music as his father would like. To please his father Benny marries the mobsters daughter and his life would seem to be set until WWII breaks out and Benny is sent to Europe. While on patrol Benny comes across a piano in an abandoned building where he takes a minute to play a little music. The music rouses a wounded German soldier who for a moment seems to be lulled by Benny's playing, but in a moment that shows the ruthlessness of war, and proof that music doesn't always soothe the savage breast, the German soldier kills Benny.The story flashes forward to Benny's son Tony, a teenager finding himself smothered in the inertia of the late 50's, early 60's suburban television life. Tony steals a car and is off on his own Jack Kerouac On The Road adventure. When he lands in Kansas he meets a beautiful girl and they have a night of passion. Tony makes his way to San Franscisco where he meets a rock band fronted by Frankie Hart who has a more than passing resemblance to Janis Joplin. Tony lies to them and tells them he writes songs, and Tony proceeds to writing a slew of hit songs, as well as providing drugs to the band. Eventually, the drugs take over and rule Tony's life, Frankie dies, and when the band finds itself in Kansas Tony adopts a kid named Little Petey who reminds him of the girl he meet in Kansas so many years before. Tony and Little Pete go to New York where Tony teaches Little Pete the ins and outs of writing songs and drug dealing, until one day Tony splits, leaving Pete with a legacy of loving music and drug dealing. When Petey grows up he uses his drug dealing connections to get a band interested in songs he's written which culminates in Petey becoming successful, Zalmie's dream realized at last.If the plot and story seem a  little stereotyped or like you've seen them before, you probably have. What Makes American Pop different from other movies is the animation and the music. Bakshi uses the animation to great effect, from what would ordinarily be an average movie to something special, and uses just enough vintage footage to set the tone of the era. The real star of the movie though, is the music. Most of the musical forms and writers of the 20th Century are represented, to name just a few George M Cohan, Scott Joplin, Richard Rodgers, Jerome Kern, Dave Brubeck, Elvis, Lou Reed, Heart, Pat Benatar, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Bob Seeger.American Pop came out almost 30 years ago, and a couple of years ago I found myself intereseted in seeing the movie again, so I bought the DVD and hoped that I wouldn't find the material dated, and I wasn't disappointed the movie still holds its appeal. The only thing that could have enhanced the DVD was some bonus features, there isn't even a directors commentary, and maybe a documentary on the making of American Pop or on Bakshi's influence in the world of animation, I think it could arguably be said American Pop influenced the animation of today such as the Pixar movies.",4,"A Family History of Music, Ambition, & Tragedy",1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,4022,"['American', 'Pop', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'animated', 'tale', 'family', 'struggle', 'realize', 'musical', 'ambitions', '20th', 'Century.Zalmie', 'Russian', 'Jewish', 'immigrant', 'NY', 'father', 'cantor', 'was', 'killed', 'pogrom', 'Czar', 'Cossacks', 'arriving', 'America', 'mother', 'killed', 'sweatshop', 'fire', 'Zalmie', 'left', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'Zalmie', 'place', 'world', 'Vaudeville', 'first', 'distributing', 'chorus', 'slips', 'customers', 'can', 'sing', 'along', 'then', 'up', 'Vaudeville', 'ropes', 'singer', 'USO', 'show', 'WWI', 'France', 'German', 'attack', 'Zalmie', 'wounded', 'throat', 'ending', 'dream', 'being', 'singer', 'Vaudeville', 'comedian', 'girl', 'dreams', 'stripper', 'Zalmie', 'turn', 'star', 'life', 'intervenes', 'again', 'pregnant', 'Zalmie', 'needing', 'earn', 'living', 'mob.Zalmie', 'ambitions', 'are', 'resurrected', 'son', 'Benny', 'talented', 'piano', 'player', 'Benny', 'would', 'rather', 'play', 'negro', 'Jazz', 'band', 'seriously', 'pursue', 'music', 'father', 'would', 'like', 'please', 'father', 'Benny', 'mobsters', 'daughter', 'life', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'set', 'WWII', 'out', 'Benny', 'sent', 'Europe', 'patrol', 'Benny', 'piano', 'abandoned', 'building', 'where', 'minute', 'play', 'little', 'music', 'music', 'wounded', 'German', 'soldier', 'who', 'moment', 'be', 'lulled', 'Benny', 'playing', 'moment', 'ruthlessness', 'war', 'proof', 'music', ""n't"", 'always', 'soothe', 'savage', 'breast', 'German', 'soldier', 'Benny.The', 'story', 'flashes', 'forward', 'Benny', 'son', 'Tony', 'teenager', 'finding', 'smothered', 'inertia', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'suburban', 'television', 'life', 'Tony', 'car', 'off', 'own', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'Road', 'adventure', 'When', 'Kansas', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'have', 'night', 'passion', 'Tony', 'way', 'San', 'Franscisco', 'where', 'rock', 'band', 'fronted', 'Frankie', 'Hart', 'who', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'Tony', 'tells', 'songs', 'Tony', 'proceeds', 'writing', 'slew', 'hit', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'drugs', 'band', 'Eventually', 'drugs', 'take', 'rule', 'Tony', 'life', 'Frankie', 'when', 'band', 'Kansas', 'Tony', 'kid', 'named', 'Little', 'Petey', 'who', 'girl', 'Kansas', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Tony', 'Little', 'Pete', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'Tony', 'Little', 'Pete', 'ins', 'outs', 'writing', 'songs', 'drug', 'dealing', 'one', 'day', 'Tony', 'splits', 'leaving', 'Pete', 'legacy', 'loving', 'music', 'drug', 'dealing', 'When', 'Petey', 'up', 'drug', 'dealing', 'connections', 'get', 'band', 'interested', 'songs', 'written', 'Petey', 'becoming', 'successful', 'Zalmie', 'dream', 'realized', 'plot', 'story', 'seem', 'little', 'stereotyped', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'probably', 'have', 'What', 'Makes', 'American', 'Pop', 'different', 'other', 'movies', 'animation', 'music', 'Bakshi', 'animation', 'great', 'effect', 'what', 'would', 'ordinarily', 'be', 'average', 'movie', 'something', 'special', 'just', 'enough', 'vintage', 'footage', 'set', 'tone', 'era', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'music', 'Most', 'musical', 'forms', 'writers', '20th', 'Century', 'are', 'represented', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'George', 'M', 'Cohan', 'Scott', 'Joplin', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'Jerome', 'Kern', 'Dave', 'Brubeck', 'Elvis', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'Heart', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Doors', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'Bob', 'Seeger.American', 'Pop', 'came', 'out', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'couple', 'years', 'found', 'intereseted', 'seeing', 'movie', 'again', 'bought', 'DVD', 'hoped', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'material', 'dated', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'movie', 'still', 'appeal', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'enhanced', 'DVD', 'was', 'bonus', 'features', ""n't"", 'even', 'directors', 'commentary', 'maybe', 'documentary', 'making', 'American', 'Pop', 'Bakshi', 'influence', 'world', 'animation', 'think', 'could', 'arguably', 'be', 'said', 'American', 'Pop', 'influenced', 'animation', 'today', 'such', 'Pixar', 'movies']",N/A

There are definitely things about his style that annoy me, like his attraction to larger women, so much that they are practically all he uses. His, ugly yet honest style and his grim though realistic view of society. Honestly, what makes this film look so good is the rotoscoping. Now, I'm not saying every animation studio should take it up, but since most non-Disney animated films are so badly animated maybe it would be for the best. Anyway, the dialogue is great, though some of the protagonists could have been a lot more likable. I'm not saying that storywise this film is pleasant to watch, it's a pretty sad story, and even the victorius ending doesn't alter that. But speaking as someone who has seen tons and tons of animated films, this movie is so beautifully done that you can't take your eyes away from it no matter how depressing and sometimes annoying the story might get. Now I noticed one reviewer calling this film a failure because it was supposed to be a history of music and yet it had a few flaws here and there in its facts.

9919,ALXZ64A9OAPJ8,0767809548,"Phrodoe ""Child Of The Kindly Midwest""","[6, 21]","Let me get this straight right off the bat: I am a HUGE fan of Ralph Bakshi's work. Fritz the Cat, Heavy Traffic, and his Lord of the Rings adaptation (to a lesser degree) are all classics of alternative or &quot;adult&quot; animation. They are vibrant, fun, and mordantly witty in a way that Disney will NEVER be -- sort of like Bob Clampett after the world's biggest lost weekend. So, yes, I love Bakshi's work -- and I hate, hate, HATE this movie, a prototypical product of the School of Rotoscoping that should be in every animation textbook as an example of what NOT to do.I realize this is probably not a popular view, but hear me out.  The story is improbable at best -- the pretentious idea that one family was responsible for every great shift in American popular song, from ragtime to punk (actually a British invention more than it is an American one, and that's just one example of this movie's wrongheadedness), is an insult to the memories of everyone from George Gershwin to Buddy Holly, from Irving Berlin to Bob Seger. Aside from that, the few moments of power and pathos this movie contains (and yes, there are a few), are undermined by the sloppy writing and the herkimer-jerkimer animation. The dialogue is as stilted as the motion in American Pop.Okay, I know I'm spitting on an icon many people hold dear, but I'm really serious here, especially where the animation is concerned. It's one thing to use a little bit of the rotoscope process; Disney had no compunctions against it, and neither did the Fleischer Brothers or the denizens of Warner Brothers' Termite Terrace. However, all of the abovementioned used rotoscoping in small measures; even Snow White didn't overuse the technique, and that's one of the most-rotoscoped of the Disney features. American Pop, on the other hand, not only overdoes it on the rotoscoping, it actually makes the rotoscoping look like something traced rather than original artwork, a crime of which Disney, the Fleischers, et al, were never guilty. The effect of this &quot;over-'scoping&quot; is to rob the viewer's imagination, rather than to stimulate it. I was never captured by this film; rather, I found myself wondering how much it cost to hire mediocre actors, then &quot;animate&quot; their every move. (And the acting really is mediocre in this thing, too. I'd rather watch an episode of Alias Smith and Jones than this dreck.)Then there's the godawful way all the great music in this film is represented. One example: The &quot;freakout&quot; sequence, which does for the late, lamented Jefferson Airplane what trichonosis does for pork chops. What's the deal, Ralph? Did Paul Kantner and Grace Slick threaten a lawsuit if you drew in the actual band that performed &quot;Somebody To Love&quot;? And as if that isn't enough, then the absolute butchering of &quot;Night Moves&quot; (which starts with a guitar riff, NOT a piano riff!) and &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; will break any true rock fan's heart. Bakshi's entire crew should be prosecuted for crimes against music.In closing, gentle web friends, let me just say that there is nothing wrong with this movie that a blowtorch couldn't fix. American Pop is a huge waste of celluloid, and would've been rotten with the live actors they rotoscoped over. Animated, it stinks on ice. Avoid this one at all costs, and watch Fritz the Cat instead.

And in no film is that style put on fuller display then in American Pop; an exploration of American history -both beautiful and grotesque- through violence and our unrivaled musical heritage.  Would any other animator use the sounds of classic swing for a scene depicting brutal trench warfare?  And to call the final medley of classic rock tunes that brings this true work of art to a stunning and triumphant close visually astounding would be underselling it.  Bakshi has had mixed results using rotoscoping in his various works, but this is clearly an example pf getting it right.  Bits of real (often tragic) footage are inserted along with the trials and tribulations of our animated protagonists and it's all set to music.  Wonderful, classic, unforgettable music.  This is a must see for any purported fan of animation, American culture, music, or all three.The story of American Pop actually begins in Russia.  At the turn of the century a young child flees the country with his mother and discovers a love of show business when he is recruited to work at a burlesque house in New York City and the result is four generations of dreamers traveling America with the dream to make it big.  Along with the wonders of show business and numerous characters met along the way, we see the sickness of American culture through montages of mafia warfare, American wars, slam dancing, the drug scene, strippers, riots, and various other cultural realities (depending on the era) juxtaposed with the timeless music that provides the soundtrack to the visual feasts.  Songs from Bob Dylan, Elvis, Bob Seger, Jimmy Hendrix, The Sex Pistols (curiously not American), and a great many other 60's and 70's artists are featured as well as a large number of tunes too far before my time for me to identify the artists involved, but you'll know the songs when you hear them.  Even with the amazing visuals, artistically epic scope, numerous personal touches and heartfelt emotional moments, and everything else that makes American Pop a wonderful film, the star is always the music.  Could have used some Motown though.  Definitely.Truth be told, the film -like many other Bakshi works- feels a little bit incomplete.  But then again, how do you end the story of an entire family line?  From the humble beginning as Jewish Russian immigrants in the 1890's to the 1970's rock and roll scene, the four protagonists span nearly a century of music, history, and culture passing along their dream and love of music from father to son.  The film is sad, exhilarating, occasionally titillating or violent, and undeniably beautiful.  Almost certainly Bakshi's best work and a film that should be MUCH more well-known than it is. But four decades after the man smashed the barrier that says cartoons are for kids, America may still not be ready for his brand of experimental animated reality.  And that, my friends, is a damn shame.4 1/2 stars, rounded up for being truly one-of-a-kind.",5,Hell is for children.,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,3165,"['Say', 'what', 'want', 'excesses', 'legendary', 'underground', 'animator', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'creator', 'notorious', 'first', 'X-rated', 'cartoon', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'one', 'thing', 'man', 'had', 'going', 'style', 'film', 'style', 'put', 'fuller', 'display', 'then', 'American', 'Pop', 'exploration', 'American', 'history', '-both', 'beautiful', 'grotesque-', 'violence', 'unrivaled', 'musical', 'heritage', 'Would', 'other', 'animator', 'sounds', 'classic', 'swing', 'scene', 'depicting', 'brutal', 'trench', 'warfare', 'call', 'final', 'medley', 'classic', 'rock', 'tunes', 'true', 'work', 'art', 'stunning', 'triumphant', 'close', 'visually', 'astounding', 'would', 'be', 'underselling', 'Bakshi', 'had', 'mixed', 'results', 'using', 'rotoscoping', 'various', 'works', 'clearly', 'example', 'pf', 'getting', 'right', 'Bits', 'real', 'often', 'footage', 'are', 'inserted', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'animated', 'protagonists', 'set', 'music', 'Wonderful', 'classic', 'unforgettable', 'music', 'must', 'see', 'purported', 'fan', 'animation', 'American', 'culture', 'music', 'three.The', 'story', 'American', 'Pop', 'actually', 'Russia', 'turn', 'century', 'young', 'child', 'country', 'mother', 'love', 'show', 'business', 'when', 'recruited', 'work', 'burlesque', 'house', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'result', 'four', 'generations', 'dreamers', 'traveling', 'America', 'dream', 'make', 'big', 'wonders', 'show', 'business', 'numerous', 'characters', 'met', 'way', 'see', 'sickness', 'American', 'culture', 'montages', 'mafia', 'warfare', 'American', 'wars', 'slam', 'dancing', 'drug', 'scene', 'strippers', 'riots', 'various', 'other', 'cultural', 'realities', 'depending', 'era', 'juxtaposed', 'timeless', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'visual', 'feasts', 'Songs', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Elvis', 'Bob', 'Seger', 'Jimmy', 'Hendrix', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'curiously', 'not', 'American', 'great', 'many', 'other', '60', '70', 'artists', 'are', 'featured', 'as', 'well', 'large', 'number', 'tunes', 'too', 'far', 'time', 'identify', 'artists', 'involved', ""'ll"", 'know', 'songs', 'when', 'hear', 'Even', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'artistically', 'epic', 'scope', 'numerous', 'personal', 'touches', 'heartfelt', 'emotional', 'moments', 'everything', 'else', 'American', 'Pop', 'wonderful', 'film', 'star', 'always', 'music', 'Could', 'have', 'used', 'Motown', 'Definitely.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'film', '-like', 'many', 'other', 'Bakshi', 'works-', 'feels', 'little', 'bit', 'incomplete', 'then', 'again', 'how', 'do', 'end', 'story', 'entire', 'family', 'line', 'humble', 'beginning', 'Jewish', 'Russian', 'immigrants', '1890', '1970', 'rock', 'roll', 'scene', 'four', 'protagonists', 'span', 'nearly', 'century', 'music', 'history', 'culture', 'passing', 'dream', 'love', 'music', 'father', 'son', 'film', 'sad', 'exhilarating', 'occasionally', 'titillating', 'violent', 'undeniably', 'beautiful', 'Almost', 'certainly', 'Bakshi', 'best', 'work', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'MUCH', 'more', 'well-known', 'four', 'decades', 'man', 'smashed', 'barrier', 'cartoons', 'are', 'kids', 'America', 'may', 'still', 'not', 'be', 'ready', 'brand', 'experimental', 'animated', 'reality', 'friends', 'damn', 'shame.4', '1/2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', 'being', 'truly', 'one-of-a-kind']",N/A
