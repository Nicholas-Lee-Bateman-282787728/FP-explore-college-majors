Yes, Troy Donahue, was a movie idol in those days and we flocked to his films after seeing him with Sanda Dee in &#34;A Summer Place.&#34;..a fine movie.Tobacco is no longer king or even prince in the USA..so the emphasis on the beauty, power, and obsession with tobacco growing loses impact.The three women in the film are stereotyped ad nausea: the &#34;fast&#34; (as mother used to say) with the good heart who can't say no to the bad guy; the beautiful, spoiled girl who really is the &#34;slut&#34; in words and actions; and the sweet, innocent, untouched and pure &#34;good&#34; girl.  All three are supposed to be providing the protaganist, Parrish (Troy), his first expereinces in love.  From fast, to sophicated slut, to good girl innocence.  Whose idea of expereince is that?

349275,A7Y6AVS576M03,6302986338,gobirds2,"[5, 5]","PARRISH is the second film that teamed director Delmer Daves and teen idol Troy Donahue. Despite its notoriously poor reviews, this is a very good film in the context of the soap opera genre and extends beyond many inherent bounds of that genre for its sheer entertainment. This is good filmmaking. Delmer Daves was the consummate professional, being a meticulous craftsman. His films were beautifully photographed; many times employing difficult crane shots to incorporate the characters into their environment from which he contrasted their own conflicts. This film is no exception as it deals with the struggle for control over Connecticut's tobacco farming industry. The main antagonist is the all-powerful Judd Raike (Karl Malden) who intends to buy out the entire valley. His main nemesis is the noble Sala Post (Dean Jagger) who stands for uncompromising integrity. Parrish MacLean (Troy Donahue) and his mother, Ellen (Claudette Colbert) arrive in tobacco country from Boston and become involved in the conflict. Along the way Donahue finds three love interests: Connie Stevens, Diane McBain and Sharon Hugueny. Critics at the time criticized Malden's maniacal performance, but in light of today's cutthroat business tactics it seems right on target. However, I always best admired Jagger's mild but dignified performance. Much of the location photography was filmed in Connecticut (the Sala Post house in Middlefield, the Charles W. Morgan whaling ship at Mystic Seaport, the Connecticut River ferryboat photographed from Gillette's Castle, the Congregational Church in Essex for wedding scenes, the Tara Mare Resort Hotel and Marina at Saybrook Point, the United States Navy submarine base at Groton and Tobacco Fields and Sheds in Hartford County were all featured). Having lived in Connecticut all my life, I can really appreciate the authenticity and craftsmanship that was put into this film. It is a beautiful film very much enhanced by Max Steiner's evocative young-at-heart score. Steiner's score is very distinctive and musically iconic for the Troy Donahue films directed by Daves. They don't make them like this anymore. This film was based on the novel by Connecticut's own Mildred Savage. I highly recommend this motion picture. This Warner's DVD print is very good and much overdue.",5,Classic filmmaking from director Delmer Daves,1235606400,"02 26, 2009",2009,2305,"['PARRISH', 'second', 'film', 'teamed', 'director', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'teen', 'idol', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'notoriously', 'poor', 'reviews', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'context', 'soap', 'opera', 'genre', 'many', 'inherent', 'bounds', 'genre', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'was', 'consummate', 'professional', 'being', 'meticulous', 'craftsman', 'films', 'were', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'many', 'times', 'employing', 'difficult', 'crane', 'shots', 'incorporate', 'characters', 'environment', 'contrasted', 'own', 'conflicts', 'film', 'exception', 'struggle', 'control', 'Connecticut', 'tobacco', 'farming', 'industry', 'main', 'antagonist', 'all-powerful', 'Judd', 'Raike', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'who', 'buy', 'out', 'entire', 'valley', 'main', 'nemesis', 'noble', 'Sala', 'Post', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'who', 'uncompromising', 'integrity', 'Parrish', 'MacLean', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'mother', 'Ellen', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'arrive', 'tobacco', 'country', 'Boston', 'become', 'involved', 'conflict', 'way', 'Donahue', 'three', 'love', 'interests', 'Connie', 'Stevens', 'Diane', 'McBain', 'Sharon', 'Hugueny', 'Critics', 'time', 'criticized', 'Malden', 'maniacal', 'performance', 'light', 'today', 'cutthroat', 'business', 'tactics', 'right', 'target', 'However', 'always', 'best', 'admired', 'Jagger', 'mild', 'dignified', 'performance', 'Much', 'location', 'photography', 'was', 'filmed', 'Connecticut', 'Sala', 'Post', 'house', 'Middlefield', 'Charles', 'W.', 'Morgan', 'whaling', 'ship', 'Mystic', 'Seaport', 'Connecticut', 'River', 'ferryboat', 'photographed', 'Gillette', 'Castle', 'Congregational', 'Church', 'Essex', 'wedding', 'scenes', 'Tara', 'Mare', 'Resort', 'Hotel', 'Marina', 'Saybrook', 'Point', 'United', 'States', 'Navy', 'submarine', 'base', 'Groton', 'Tobacco', 'Fields', 'Sheds', 'Hartford', 'County', 'were', 'featured', 'Having', 'lived', 'Connecticut', 'life', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'authenticity', 'craftsmanship', 'was', 'put', 'film', 'beautiful', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'enhanced', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'evocative', 'young-at-heart', 'score', 'Steiner', 'score', 'very', 'distinctive', 'musically', 'iconic', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'films', 'directed', 'Daves', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'Connecticut', 'own', 'Mildred', 'Savage', 'highly', 'recommend', 'motion', 'picture', 'Warner', 'DVD', 'print', 'very', 'good', 'much', 'overdue']",Parrish VHS

Rather than thinking, as some have said, that Carl Malden overplayed Judd Raike, I thought he did a wonderful job and I don't even like Carl Malden. Could never get past the nose.

349290,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,6302986338,Paul Sayles,"[45, 45]","This is a story of families in struggle for Connecticut tobacco, Karl Malden vs. Dean Jagger, with assistance on Jagger's side by Troy Donahue et al.I have lived near sites that were used in the filming of Parrish, so I guess this is a review with homesickness in it as well as objectivity.  That being said, this is a good solid movie with exceptional acting from Malden, Jagger, Claudette Colbert, Dub Taylor and in his own way, Donahue, as the battle for control of prime tobacco land is fought out.Malden may seem a little over the top in his portrayal of Judd but it is a perfect definition of a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  It is this single-mindedness that strikes throughout the film.  Unfortunately, Malden is saddled with two &quot;nitwit&quot; sons who do little to take the pressure off.  Maybe this is part of what makes Malden's character what it is; the inability to delegate with confidence and so he is doubly forced to compensate for lack of talent in his own organization.  Donahue is seen as an unlikely allie for Malden.  However, Donahue is unable to acquire the ruthless instincts of Malden and eventually rebels.  He is seasoned by an enlistment in the Navy and the submarine service and then returns to do battle with Malden and his family.There are a number of surprise topics that are tackled, Jagger accepts that he is a rather low key personality, so low key that his wife left him.  She was killed shortly thereafter leaving him to raise a daughter single-handedly.  He acknowledges that he has not been successful and the assistance of Claudette Colbert to manage her is of little avail.  Pregnancy, and if you like, adultery are openly talked about.  Loveless marriages litter the landscape of Connecticut throughout this film.Jagger sees Donahue as a someone can resist Malden and stakes him to land and the opportunity to attempt to hold off Malden's attempts to control the land.  Donahue appears to be succeeding as the movie ends.  He has met the challenge of Malden, but you don't know if he will win; you think he will but you never really know.This is an excellent film, capturing an industry and region that is little known.  The supporting cast is outstnading and gives the film depth that it needs to succeed.  The depiction of migrant labor is especially interesting; again because it is taking place in a region that one wouldn't expect to see it.Parrish is a must for those with a love/longing for New England as it gives you a little of everything.  I highly recommend this film to all.",4,Nice solid film,973814400,"11 10, 2000",2000,2556,"['story', 'families', 'struggle', 'Connecticut', 'tobacco', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'vs.', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'assistance', 'Jagger', 'side', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'et', 'al.I', 'have', 'lived', 'sites', 'were', 'used', 'filming', 'Parrish', 'guess', 'review', 'homesickness', 'as', 'well', 'objectivity', 'being', 'said', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'Malden', 'Jagger', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Dub', 'Taylor', 'own', 'way', 'Donahue', 'battle', 'control', 'prime', 'tobacco', 'land', 'fought', 'out.Malden', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'top', 'portrayal', 'Judd', 'perfect', 'definition', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'what', 'single-mindedness', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Malden', 'saddled', 'two', 'quot', 'quot', 'sons', 'who', 'do', 'little', 'take', 'pressure', 'off', 'Maybe', 'part', 'what', 'Malden', 'character', 'what', 'inability', 'delegate', 'confidence', 'so', 'doubly', 'forced', 'compensate', 'lack', 'talent', 'own', 'organization', 'Donahue', 'seen', 'unlikely', 'allie', 'Malden', 'However', 'Donahue', 'unable', 'acquire', 'ruthless', 'instincts', 'Malden', 'eventually', 'rebels', 'seasoned', 'enlistment', 'Navy', 'submarine', 'service', 'then', 'returns', 'do', 'battle', 'Malden', 'family.There', 'are', 'number', 'surprise', 'topics', 'are', 'tackled', 'Jagger', 'rather', 'low', 'key', 'personality', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'wife', 'left', 'was', 'killed', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'leaving', 'raise', 'daughter', 'single-handedly', 'not', 'been', 'successful', 'assistance', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'manage', 'little', 'avail', 'Pregnancy', 'like', 'adultery', 'are', 'openly', 'talked', 'Loveless', 'litter', 'landscape', 'Connecticut', 'film.Jagger', 'Donahue', 'someone', 'can', 'resist', 'Malden', 'stakes', 'land', 'opportunity', 'attempt', 'hold', 'off', 'Malden', 'attempts', 'control', 'land', 'Donahue', 'be', 'succeeding', 'movie', 'met', 'challenge', 'Malden', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'win', 'think', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'know.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'capturing', 'industry', 'region', 'little', 'known', 'supporting', 'cast', 'outstnading', 'film', 'depth', 'succeed', 'depiction', 'migrant', 'labor', 'especially', 'interesting', 'again', 'taking', 'place', 'region', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'it.Parrish', 'must', 'love/longing', 'New', 'England', 'little', 'everything', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",Parrish VHS

Or those ""late night"" comedies where it's either Wayne's World clone ""dewwds' on a quest for bimbos and pot, or feature-length copies of today's mean-spirited sitcoms. To most people, ""adult fare"" does not mean maturity, it means it's tawdry--the more tawdry the better. So I knew they wouldn't be interested in this one. So I use the term ""mature"" for this one--it inspred me to read the book and it's a good story in which twentysomethings act like real grownups rather than extended adolescents. The kind of thing you'd expect of Hollywood's original ""non-brat pack"". Here we've got Troy Donahue in the title role as a young guy who wants his independence, not necessarily to ""par-tay-har-tay"". Reviewers of this film (and the book) describe Parrish as a ""youthful rebel"", possibly to lure a viewerbase already becoming jaded and spoiled. Dean Jagger plays Conneticut tobacco grower Sala Post (this film teaches you that his name is pronounced a lot like ""sailor""), whose debutante daughter (Diane McBain) Parrish's mother (Claudette Colbert) has been hired to prepare the girl for her ""coming out"". Karl Malden plays Sala's biggest competitor Judd Raike, an ""empire-builder"" tobacco tycoon in the process of taking over and crowding out all other growers in the area. He has two sons, one a pale imitation of the father with all of the arrogance but none of the drive or backbone, the other a legitimate ancestor of today's ""par-tay-har-tay"" type. His drug of choice is expensive booze--today he'd be snorting coke, with weed as a chaser. Which is to say, the sons are two sides of the ""spoiled rich boy"" coin. Raike's youngest is incongruously a ""sweet young thing"" type daughter (Sharon Hugueny). Parrish variously romances Post's daughter, a girl he works the fields with (Connie Stevens) and the Raike girl, who we know is Miss Right even if she has a real S.O.B for a daddy. So here we have a film with four members of Brat Pack: The Previous Generation (Donahue, Stevens, McBain and Hugueny), who aren't as ""cool"" as the later `80s bunch were, but they were cool enough for the times. Guys like my housemates would be loudly and whinily bored with this flick, but it comes from a time when movies were about characters with real character. People you could respect rather than them impressing you with how shocking for its own sake they can behave. There are a few movies like that nowadays, but very few.

This romantic idea is conveyed with care, astute deliberation, and intelligent scriptwriting in this classic, beautifully-photographed romance (1961 vintage). Of course, there is only one Parrish in the movie vault. Our versatile suitor is portrayed by the handsome actor Troy Donahue. He is the immediate focal point for three women (Connie Stevens, Diane McBain, and Sharon Hugueny) in this professional film (directed by Delmer Daves). Nuances abound as Parrish connects with each woman with the utmost sincerity; as the story unfolds, frustrations mount, tempers flare, and feminine angst surfaces with the unfolding plotline.His presence upsets our heroines; his smile drives the romantic plot right through the roof and into the blue sky above. Parrish presents the audience with subtle dramatic flurries. Each actor and actress (to their credit) provides an excellent interpretation of character and intent. And, we have not even mentioned passionate kissing. Waiting for that first kiss establishes good tension; which drives the crescendo from Act I to Act III. Truly excellent romantic dialogue, emotional pitch, truth, patient observance (by certain women), conflict, passionate embrace, acceptable intimacy (for that time), and humility are fully conveyed in this film. All non-romantic subplots dispense their importance by Act III for the final dramatic empathy (for the audience) within the controlling theme, one man-one woman-in love, by curtain time.Just to watch this film is to revisit memories from that era; to see what it was like back then. Within that retrospection, it becomes easy to admire the beautiful country setting, the stunning cinematography, the emotive soundtrack, the simplicity of this almost-pastoral romance, and the richness of the film itself. These classic romances do herald a bygone era; yet they remain firm in their high standards of a professional storyline, a true crescendo, and a refined denouement.
