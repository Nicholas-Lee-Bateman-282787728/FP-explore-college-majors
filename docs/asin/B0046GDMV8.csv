1387683,A336ELI13OGMHJ,B0046GDMV8,"Bill Lee, Author","[1, 1]","Great film about how different family members cope with grief. Angela Bassett portrays the mother killed in a traffic accident, leaving her husband (played by Robert Townsend), a workaholic, to raise their three children. The fact that the kids are far apart in age presents interesting storylines as each are also contending with personal issues, such as career and peer pressure. The movie also addresses the subject of sexual abuse in a sensitive manner. The screenplay, acting, and directing are all top-notch. This film should be shown in all middle and high schools.",5,In a Word: Powerful,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,572,"['Great', 'film', 'how', 'different', 'family', 'members', 'cope', 'grief', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'mother', 'killed', 'traffic', 'accident', 'leaving', 'husband', 'played', 'Robert', 'Townsend', 'workaholic', 'raise', 'three', 'children', 'fact', 'kids', 'are', 'far', 'apart', 'age', 'presents', 'interesting', 'storylines', 'are', 'also', 'contending', 'personal', 'issues', 'such', 'career', 'peer', 'pressure', 'movie', 'also', 'subject', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'sensitive', 'manner', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', 'top-notch', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'middle', 'high', 'schools']",Of Boys and Men

What I like most about the movie is that it wasn't overacted, overproduced or overdone. Each character played their role as if it was really their life. No token rappers or singers to sell tickets or to gain appeal, just a well written story with a good plot.This is a Black movie, that doesn't offer the stereotypical portrayal of Black culture. There is no foul language, no exaggerated ignorant people who are from the ""hood"", and practically everyone actually speaks without the use of slang. You can't make enough movies like this. Robert Townsend isn't given enough credit. Makes you wonder how different things would be if he actually did end of writing for BET before Bob Johnson refused to bring him on board.Simply put, watch this movie with your family, friends, loved one, etc...

There are really no light moments outside of a few romantic memories and one special kiss towards the end. The movie was very realistic, but it was also the type of film you have to watch when you're in the right mindset. Instead of escaping reality, this one might just smack you in the face with reality. Not a bad thing, just a heads up.Pros: I like Robert Townsend in this fatherly/husband role. I've seen him in other films over the years, but I honestly think this is one of the best (and most believable) roles he's played. I found myself just looking at him in every scene, and I don't do that with many actors. This film suited him. Dante Boens, who plays Z, is going to break some hearts as he gets older. What a cute little boy! Actually the whole family was an attractive bunch, and it was good to see African-American characters living a movie life outside of the stereotypes that seem to follow entirely too many black films around. I could've done without Little D's character (played by Bobb'e J. Thompson) and the coach Roman (played by Faizon Love), but it's not like those characters don't exist in real life. As with reality, you have to take the good with the misguided. I was very interested in the complexity of college graduate Terrell (played by Vince Green), who was going through the motions of finding out that after getting the degree, that's when the real work starts. It's also when Corporate America gave him a shove in the wrong direction.The movie is about a family whose lives were pulled apart after a car accident leaving the others motherless or wifeless. When Aunt Janay (played by Victoria Rowell) comes to their Chicago home to help out after Rieta Cole's (played by Angela Bassett) death, the family has to come to grips with their loss and who they really are as people.",4,Not surprising but interesting nonetheless,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,1883,"['Cons', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'watching', 'film', ""'re"", 'good', 'mood', 'are', 'really', 'light', 'moments', 'few', 'romantic', 'memories', 'one', 'special', 'kiss', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'was', 'also', 'type', 'film', 'have', 'watch', 'when', ""'re"", 'right', 'mindset', 'Instead', 'escaping', 'reality', 'one', 'might', 'just', 'smack', 'face', 'reality', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'heads', 'like', 'Robert', 'Townsend', 'fatherly/husband', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'years', 'honestly', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'believable', 'played', 'found', 'just', 'looking', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'many', 'actors', 'film', 'suited', 'Dante', 'Boens', 'who', 'Z', 'going', 'break', 'hearts', 'older', 'What', 'cute', 'little', 'boy', 'Actually', 'whole', 'family', 'was', 'attractive', 'bunch', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'African-American', 'characters', 'living', 'movie', 'life', 'stereotypes', 'seem', 'follow', 'entirely', 'too', 'many', 'black', 'films', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Little', 'D', 'character', 'played', 'Bobb', 'e', 'J.', 'Thompson', 'coach', 'Roman', 'played', 'Faizon', 'Love', 'not', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'reality', 'have', 'take', 'good', 'misguided', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'complexity', 'college', 'graduate', 'Terrell', 'played', 'Vince', 'Green', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'motions', 'finding', 'out', 'getting', 'degree', 'when', 'real', 'work', 'starts', 'also', 'when', 'Corporate', 'America', 'gave', 'shove', 'wrong', 'direction.The', 'movie', 'family', 'lives', 'were', 'pulled', 'apart', 'car', 'accident', 'leaving', 'others', 'motherless', 'wifeless', 'When', 'Aunt', 'Janay', 'played', 'Victoria', 'Rowell', 'Chicago', 'home', 'help', 'out', 'Rieta', 'Cole', 'played', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'death', 'family', 'come', 'grips', 'loss', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'people']",Of Boys and Men
