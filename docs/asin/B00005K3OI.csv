Production values are good. There are a few witticisms.But right underneath are some really nasty ideas, all of them hugely sexist in that ""men are evil"" way that gives chick flicks a bad name and should offend anyone who sees them.The plot of ""Someone Like You"" is simple:  ""Men are evil.  Just kidding. The end.""So, OK, the movie isn't the worst ever made.  Teeny, tiny Size-Zero Ashley Judd is funny and appealing in the cookie-cutter Meg Ryan part (although her character chomps cookies nonstop through the movie -- like *that's* realistic).  Hugh Jackman is likeable and very funny. That's about it.  Marisa Tomei is criminally wasted as Ashley's friend (I just hope she got a good paycheck for such a thankless part), but she looks gorgeous.But that's about it. The movie's really sexist at heart, and in a continuing trend, somehow the whole idea that ""Men are evil"" is supposed to be cute and inoffensive, where any film claiming the opposite would certainly have us women yelling pretty loudly.  It's offensive.  No, men aren't evil, they're not bulls, and movies like this aren't as smart or witty as they think they are.  Which is a shame, because it has a few charming moments in all the hypocrisy that had me wishing they'd simply paid the writer a few bucks for a better film.So much for the ""chick flick"" theory.  We all deserve better than stupid, badly written movies with terrible marketing campaigns and overpaid actresses.  I mean, REALLY.  When did it become OK for a 2-star movie to get 5 stars simply because people are desperate for a little light entertainment?

660527,A82MLYSUUU3CF,B00005K3OI,"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!""","[3, 4]","Granted, the novel upon which this romantic comedy is based (Animal Husbandry) is much more intricate and intelligent then what appears on screen here, but for the casual viewer on a rainy night it's a satisfying and perky little movie that hits all the right buttons and then sends you home feeling cozy. Ashley Judd plays an assistant to a go-getter television host (Barkin) who falls in love with a new co-worker (Greg Kinnear) and embarks upon the best relationship of her life with him. After selling her apartment to move in with him, she discovers that it's over between them and the only place she can find to live on such short notice is rooming with her oversexed, bad attitude work colleague (Hugh Jackman), a guy who goes from one girl to the other in an effort to prove that the true love he once had with his girlfriend doesn't exist. While moping around in her misery, our heroine stumbles upon a theory that equates men and their need to swap partners with research done on bulls who refuse to have sex with the same cow twice. She takes off on this and decides it's worth writing about, but is it really true? Or is she just compensating for her own personal feelings of unworthiness? Judd's character will come off as a dipstick to some because the emphasis on her character is that of someone who deals with the sadness of breakups in a very self-destructive way. Some have called her character idiotic and offensive; I just thought that the fact she reminded me of myself making the same mistakes in the same situation made it hard to watch her without wincing (which is probably why it would be easier to call her idiotic and offensive). What I also find odd is how director Tony Goldwyn seems to want to suppress his characters' quirkiness; coming from the guy who directed A Walk on the Moon, a film that was about people who stuck out from the enforced norms of their times, this seems rather a cop-out way of telling a film's story. Other than that, the film's ending is too much-too soon, but throughout the bulk of its running time Someone Like You is a free-flowing film with much to recommend it. Marisa Tomei is excellent as Judd's chatty best friend, Barkin is surprisingly not as her misguided boss and look for a cameo by Judd's mother Naomi as her makeup lady.",3,Sweet romantic comedy,1003449600,"10 19, 2001",2001,2294,"['Granted', 'novel', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'based', 'Animal', 'Husbandry', 'much', 'more', 'intricate', 'intelligent', 'then', 'what', 'screen', 'here', 'casual', 'viewer', 'rainy', 'night', 'satisfying', 'perky', 'little', 'movie', 'right', 'buttons', 'then', 'home', 'feeling', 'cozy', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'assistant', 'go-getter', 'television', 'host', 'Barkin', 'who', 'love', 'new', 'co-worker', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'best', 'relationship', 'life', 'selling', 'apartment', 'move', 'over', 'only', 'place', 'can', 'find', 'live', 'such', 'short', 'notice', 'rooming', 'oversexed', 'bad', 'attitude', 'work', 'colleague', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'guy', 'who', 'one', 'girl', 'other', 'effort', 'prove', 'true', 'love', 'once', 'had', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'exist', 'moping', 'around', 'misery', 'heroine', 'theory', 'men', 'need', 'swap', 'partners', 'research', 'done', 'bulls', 'who', 'refuse', 'have', 'sex', 'same', 'cow', 'twice', 'off', 'worth', 'writing', 'really', 'true', 'just', 'compensating', 'own', 'personal', 'feelings', 'unworthiness', 'Judd', 'character', 'will', 'come', 'off', 'dipstick', 'emphasis', 'character', 'someone', 'who', 'sadness', 'breakups', 'very', 'self-destructive', 'way', 'have', 'called', 'character', 'idiotic', 'offensive', 'just', 'thought', 'fact', 'reminded', 'making', 'same', 'mistakes', 'same', 'situation', 'made', 'hard', 'watch', 'wincing', 'probably', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'call', 'idiotic', 'offensive', 'What', 'also', 'find', 'odd', 'how', 'director', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'want', 'suppress', 'characters', 'quirkiness', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'Walk', 'Moon', 'film', 'was', 'people', 'who', 'stuck', 'out', 'enforced', 'norms', 'times', 'rather', 'cop-out', 'way', 'telling', 'film', 'story', 'Other', 'film', 'ending', 'too', 'much-too', 'soon', 'bulk', 'running', 'time', 'Someone', 'free-flowing', 'film', 'much', 'recommend', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'excellent', 'Judd', 'chatty', 'best', 'friend', 'Barkin', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'misguided', 'boss', 'look', 'cameo', 'Judd', 'mother', 'Naomi', 'makeup', 'lady']",Someone Like You
660528,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B00005K3OI,Bill Garrison,"[3, 9]","Someone Like You is an example of a truly horrible movie.  The movie is based on a premise that men are like bulls and must move from woman to woman just as bulls move from cow to cow, never staying with the same one.  The movie is structured around this theme.  The great cast features Ashley Judd as Jane, the woman behind the bull and cow theory.  She is jilted by Ray (Greg Kinnear), who moves onto another ""cow.""  She moves in with Eddie (""Hugh Jackman"") for financial reasons.  She builds her theory around Eddie.  Eddie sleeps with and discards women all the time as if they mean nothing to him.  In the end Jane and Eddie get together and pronounce they love each other.This movie is horrible because of Eddie.  Actually the writers are to blame.  It is established early on that Eddie is a womanizer.  Then the movie hints at the reason behind this, showing him encountering his old girlfriend at a yoga class.  We sense they have a history and that this may have something to do with why Eddie is the way he is.  But we never find out why Eddie can't committ to a relationship.  Then with a worthless plot point about a miscarriage, Jane supposedly realizes that men aren't the problem, she is.  She throws herself at Eddie and we are left wondering why?  He's just going to use her like all of the other women he has.This movie needed to show some depth to the characters.  Most of this movie made no sense because the characters did some of the dumbest things.  Besides, if you do watch this movie, you'll realize how stupid that whole bull and cow theory is.

660532,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00005K3OI,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[8, 8]","There are two major reasons to see this movie.  They are Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd.  Both of these actors have real sizzle for a romantic comedy-drama blend.  In fact, Greg Kinnear, playing a third major character, although necessary to the plot line, doesn't strike me as a likely romantic lead at all. Kinnear's getting 2nd billing in the film surprised me.  I think Jackman can wipe him right off the screen romantically speaking.  The script is a bit predictable with Judd's character falling for Kinnear. Then, when he is torn about going back to his original girlfriend, she develops a bizarre theory about why men are like cows and bulls.  She even writes a column on it for a major magazine.  I thought the movie got better as it progressed, which is unusual, but I think the reason why was that Jackman was in more of the movie from the second half on and his screen charisma really made a difference.

660533,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00005K3OI,casualsuede,"[6, 15]","This movie was not promising from the beginning. You know when Marisa Tomei, who reminds me of a Female-Italian Woody Allen wannabee, begins analyzing yet another relationship dynamic. Now she has enlisted the help of 21-forever Ashley Judd. Of course it is Ashley who comes up with this new-age bunk that becomes the &quot;bible of the month&quot; to women who always seems to get dumped on. I got a good one for you women. Date a man uglier than you and he will be faithful forever.Ashley Judd plays Jane Goodale (not the one that saves the monkey), a self absorbed TV booker for a tabloid talk show a-la Sally Jesse Raphael. She seems to have things going well in her life, when she meets Ray Brown, a loveable guy who is new the job. He's in a three year relationship but of course it is ho-hum. So he initiates an relationship with Jane and they get hot and heavy. Two months later (although in the movie it is more like 4 minutes), they move in together. But nay...Ray gets cold feet and runs back to his sweetie.This leaves Jane in a bind and heartbroken. She has given her notice (and in NYC you're screwed if you do that...trust me) and is forced to roomie with the company playboy/badboy/chauvenistic pig. The pig (or bull) is Eddie Alden, played by Hugh Jackman who looks like a cross between Tim Daly/Wayne Gretzky and Scott Baio and he is the little playboy, seemingly picking up all the sleazy women. This of course infuriates the hurt Jane and she focuses her thoughts on why guys leaves women. Hence her &quot;new cow&quot; theory. Her theory goes like this....Men are the bull and women are the cows. The bull will shack up with the new cow, but once he has spread his seed, he will look for the &quot;new cow&quot; and never touch the now &quot;old cow&quot;. I guess this is one of Darwins theory of evolutions brought to mainstream pop culture/new age.Of course, the roomies become closer and the inevitable begins to happen. Jane's article which appears in a magazine makes her the talk of the town and she finds happiness with the man she thought she would never want to hook up with....This movie stank on all levels. First, the psychology makes no sense. They throw some dubious facts and call it reality. This &quot;new cow&quot; theory I guess would make no sense in places like Asia, where the divorce rates are less than 10%. I guess half the Americans who live monogamously would find this bunk laughable, as would those men who want to be monogamous. What about &quot;new bull&quot; syndrome? Don't cows also leave bulls to be with other bulls? Give me a break.Even worse than this silly theory/philosophy is the script. Jane is given a little treatment and we do feel a little sympathy for her blindness (cause we all probably did a &quot;Goodall&quot; once in our lives), but her relationship with Ray is passed over so quickly, that many of my friends agreed that Jane and Ray never developed a bond with each other. I mean, in the couple of scenes, they have sex and BOOM, they move in together!? The other failed relationship is between Jane and Eddie. They pretty much stay out of each other's hair. She hates Eddie for the way he is, because he proves her theory right, but there should be at least a little sexual tension or flirting right? Nothing. They just kiss at the end because the script called for it. I didn't even know that they were in to each other at that point.This movie attempts to be a Sex in the City, but it is contrived and never develops into anything. I know that this was based on a book, but if the book is anything like this stinky movie, I would recommend that you try something better....like Chocolat.....Rating: D",1,"Now, who's a cow?",1005696000,"11 14, 2001",2001,3680,"['movie', 'was', 'not', 'promising', 'beginning', 'know', 'when', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'who', 'Female-Italian', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'wannabee', 'analyzing', 'yet', 'relationship', 'dynamic', 'Now', 'enlisted', 'help', '21-forever', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'course', 'Ashley', 'who', 'up', 'new-age', 'bunk', 'quot', 'bible', 'month', 'quot', 'women', 'who', 'always', 'get', 'dumped', 'got', 'good', 'one', 'women', 'Date', 'man', 'uglier', 'will', 'be', 'faithful', 'forever.Ashley', 'Judd', 'Jane', 'Goodale', 'not', 'one', 'monkey', 'self', 'absorbed', 'TV', 'booker', 'tabloid', 'talk', 'show', 'a-la', 'Sally', 'Jesse', 'Raphael', 'have', 'things', 'going', 'well', 'life', 'when', 'Ray', 'Brown', 'loveable', 'guy', 'who', 'new', 'job', 'three', 'year', 'relationship', 'course', 'ho-hum', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'get', 'hot', 'heavy', 'Two', 'months', 'later', 'movie', 'more', '4', 'minutes', 'move', 'together', 'nay', 'Ray', 'cold', 'feet', 'back', 'sweetie.This', 'Jane', 'bind', 'heartbroken', 'given', 'notice', 'NYC', ""'re"", 'screwed', 'do', 'trust', 'forced', 'roomie', 'company', 'playboy/badboy/chauvenistic', 'pig', 'pig', 'bull', 'Eddie', 'Alden', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'who', 'cross', 'Tim', 'Daly/Wayne', 'Gretzky', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'little', 'playboy', 'seemingly', 'picking', 'up', 'sleazy', 'women', 'course', 'hurt', 'Jane', 'thoughts', 'why', 'guys', 'women', 'Hence', 'quot', 'new', 'cow', 'quot', 'theory', 'theory', '.Men', 'are', 'bull', 'women', 'are', 'cows', 'bull', 'will', 'shack', 'up', 'new', 'cow', 'once', 'spread', 'seed', 'will', 'look', 'quot', 'new', 'cow', 'quot', 'never', 'touch', 'now', 'quot', 'old', 'cow', 'quot', 'guess', 'one', 'Darwins', 'theory', 'evolutions', 'brought', 'mainstream', 'pop', 'culture/new', 'age.Of', 'course', 'roomies', 'become', 'closer', 'inevitable', 'begins', 'happen', 'Jane', 'article', 'magazine', 'talk', 'town', 'happiness', 'man', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'hook', 'up', '.This', 'movie', 'stank', 'levels', 'First', 'psychology', 'sense', 'throw', 'dubious', 'facts', 'call', 'reality', 'quot', 'new', 'cow', 'quot', 'theory', 'guess', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'places', 'Asia', 'where', 'divorce', 'rates', 'are', 'less', '10', '%', 'guess', 'Americans', 'who', 'live', 'monogamously', 'would', 'find', 'bunk', 'laughable', 'would', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'monogamous', 'What', 'quot', 'new', 'bull', 'quot', 'syndrome', 'Do', ""n't"", 'cows', 'also', 'leave', 'bulls', 'be', 'other', 'bulls', 'Give', 'break.Even', 'worse', 'silly', 'theory/philosophy', 'script', 'Jane', 'given', 'little', 'treatment', 'do', 'feel', 'little', 'sympathy', 'blindness', 'cause', 'probably', 'did', 'quot', 'Goodall', 'quot', 'once', 'lives', 'relationship', 'Ray', 'passed', 'so', 'quickly', 'many', 'friends', 'agreed', 'Jane', 'Ray', 'never', 'developed', 'bond', 'other', 'mean', 'couple', 'scenes', 'have', 'sex', 'BOOM', 'move', 'together', 'other', 'failed', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'Eddie', 'pretty', 'much', 'stay', 'other', 'hair', 'Eddie', 'way', 'theory', 'right', 'should', 'be', 'least', 'little', 'sexual', 'tension', 'flirting', 'right', 'Nothing', 'just', 'kiss', 'end', 'script', 'called', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'were', 'other', 'point.This', 'movie', 'attempts', 'be', 'Sex', 'City', 'contrived', 'never', 'anything', 'know', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'book', 'anything', 'stinky', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'try', 'something', 'better', '.like', 'Chocolat', '..Rating', 'D']",Someone Like You

I thought the novel was witty, intelligent and fun. The film, though not as good as the novel, is delightful. Ashley Judd does a great portrayal of the obsessive Jane Goodall. Gregg Kinnear does a convincing role of the commitment-shy Ray and Hugh Jackman is adorable as the womanizer Eddie. However, Marisa Tomei and Ellen Barkin shouldn't have settled for such insubstantial supporting roles. They're such great actresses, after all.The setback in the film is the ending. Like most films based on novels, the ending is altered. The ending in Animal Husbandry is subtle, whereas Someone Like You goes into dramatic mode. I know that films have to be more extravagant with the stories, but the ending here is too banal and sort of ruins the wit and fun approach the film had in the beginning.Still, I think you should get together with a few female friends and enjoy this wonderful chick flick.

Jane then decides to move in with one of her co-workers just to get even at her ex-boyfriend.

She then thinks she stumbled onto a good theory about why men are dogs...er actually like bulls and cows. Yes, humans are like bovines acording to this movie's theory (bulls will mate with several different cows, but not the same one). Does this sound romantic to you? Does it sound funny? It's neither romantic nor funny. Because the characters in this movie don't have good chemistry together. They barely seem to relate to each other on friendly terms. A good portion of the movie goes to Ashley Judd who has that wacked-out theory and the rest is about her being depressed.

I like the average look of the film and I look for those type of sceneries in romantic films.Of course, the story is important and unfortunately, that is where the problem is.  I guess I was enjoying the film but the ending...well...Let's just say that director Tony Goldwyn, said it best during his commentary in the alternative ending sequence.  Three different endings, not enough time to do the endings and the difficulties of trying to end the movie in a good note.For me, the endings were fast and swift as romantic movies were back in the 50's and 60's but in this day and age, you expect the movie to really make you smile and feel good.This one left me feeling.... well, that the ending was ok.Each character did a good job and Judd's acting seems to improve with each film.

660549,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005K3OI,D. Litton,"[1, 1]","&quot;Someone Like You&quot; has everything you'd expect out of a romantic comedy: a woman's approach to the male gender, likeable characters played by even more likeable actors, and a plot that is so fluffy and lightweight it could almost take flight. We've seen all of this done before in many other movies, with many other likeable characters and so on and so forth, but rarely has all of this ever been done so enjoyably well.To be honest, I liked the movie. I liked it for its high spirits even as its characters are depressed; I liked it for its ability to make me laugh a sufficient amount of the running time so that my attention to it was undiminished; I particularly enjoyed the fact that it doesn't attempt to be anything more or less than a sunny little romance movie, which makes its charm even more appealing.The film is definitely a woman's movie, to be sure. It stars Ashley Judd as talk show scout Jane Goodale, who becomes enraptured with feelings of undying love for hunky new producer Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear). She learns that he has a girlfriend, but that doesn't stop him from inviting her out on walks, spending time with her, and finally getting romantically involved with her. Just as they are about to move in together, after six weeks of dating, he dumps her, unable to handle the stress of dumping his old girlfriend.This sends Jane into a frenzy, who turns to the world of animal husbandry to find a reason for why her relationships never work out. Her comments become an instant success among women, though her identity is kept a secret. In effect, her comments about the behavior of the male species are her way of constructing a defense mechanism against coping with the rejection she has faced.Not everyone agrees with her on her points, most notably her new roommate, Eddie (Hugh Jackman), who brings new meaning to the word &quot;womanizer.&quot; Or at least that's how it appears on the outside; as Eddie and Jane get to know one another better, they unknowingly begin to help one another out. Jane soon learns that her defense strategy won't help her out in the long run, while Eddie realizes that there is something true to being in a relationship, if you find the right person.There's nothing new to the plot or the material; we've seen it all before. People meeting, getting together, breaking up and blaming the entire opposite gender... anyone recall such films as &quot;One Fine Day&quot; and &quot;What Women Want?&quot; None of this would work if it weren't for the adept use of humor and refreshment to keep us going with the story. Elizabeth Chandler's script isn't original, but it's not boring, either, and gives old tactics a fresh feel.This is all made possible by the charming and spunky performances from the cast, featuring some very quirky work from Ashley Judd, who spends much of the movie running around in a frenzy. Her smile could brighten up any movie, and she brings a lot of warmth and charm to her role. She also shares an ever-present chemistry with lead actors Greg Kinnear and Hugh Jackman; Kinnear plays his role just as it needs to be: like a sap. Jackman is the ideal &quot;slut,&quot; and his sparring sessions with Judd provide some very comical laughter. Not only that, but you believe in the sparks between them as well.In a long line of mature comedies that take on the battle of the sexes, &quot;Someone Like You&quot; comes up a winner. It has spontaneity and wit, is full of charm and breezy laughter, and in the end, even if all you had left were the actors and their ability to keep us entertained by their characters' grief and shenanigans, this would still be a very refreshing hit.",4,Surprisingly funny!,1001462400,"09 26, 2001",2001,3664,"['quot', 'Someone', 'quot', 'everything', ""'d"", 'expect', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'woman', 'approach', 'male', 'gender', 'likeable', 'characters', 'played', 'even', 'more', 'likeable', 'actors', 'plot', 'so', 'fluffy', 'lightweight', 'could', 'almost', 'take', 'flight', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'many', 'other', 'likeable', 'characters', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'rarely', 'ever', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'enjoyably', 'well.To', 'be', 'honest', 'liked', 'movie', 'liked', 'high', 'spirits', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'depressed', 'liked', 'ability', 'make', 'sufficient', 'amount', 'running', 'time', 'attention', 'was', 'undiminished', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'fact', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'less', 'sunny', 'little', 'romance', 'movie', 'charm', 'even', 'more', 'appealing.The', 'film', 'definitely', 'woman', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'talk', 'show', 'scout', 'Jane', 'Goodale', 'who', 'enraptured', 'feelings', 'undying', 'love', 'hunky', 'new', 'producer', 'Ray', 'Brown', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'stop', 'inviting', 'out', 'walks', 'spending', 'time', 'finally', 'getting', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Just', 'are', 'move', 'together', 'six', 'weeks', 'dating', 'unable', 'handle', 'stress', 'dumping', 'old', 'girlfriend.This', 'Jane', 'frenzy', 'who', 'world', 'animal', 'husbandry', 'find', 'reason', 'why', 'relationships', 'never', 'work', 'out', 'comments', 'become', 'instant', 'success', 'women', 'identity', 'kept', 'secret', 'effect', 'comments', 'behavior', 'male', 'species', 'are', 'way', 'constructing', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'coping', 'rejection', 'faced.Not', 'everyone', 'points', 'most', 'notably', 'new', 'roommate', 'Eddie', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'who', 'new', 'meaning', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'least', 'how', 'outside', 'Eddie', 'Jane', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'better', 'unknowingly', 'begin', 'help', 'one', 'out', 'Jane', 'soon', 'defense', 'strategy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'out', 'long', 'run', 'Eddie', 'something', 'true', 'being', 'relationship', 'find', 'right', 'person.There', 'nothing', 'new', 'plot', 'material', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'People', 'meeting', 'getting', 'together', 'breaking', 'up', 'blaming', 'entire', 'opposite', 'gender', 'anyone', 'recall', 'such', 'films', 'quot', 'One', 'Fine', 'Day', 'quot', 'quot', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'quot', 'None', 'would', 'work', 'were', ""n't"", 'adept', 'use', 'humor', 'refreshment', 'keep', 'going', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'Chandler', 'script', ""n't"", 'original', 'not', 'boring', 'either', 'old', 'tactics', 'fresh', 'feel.This', 'made', 'possible', 'charming', 'spunky', 'performances', 'cast', 'featuring', 'very', 'quirky', 'work', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'who', 'much', 'movie', 'running', 'around', 'frenzy', 'smile', 'could', 'brighten', 'up', 'movie', 'lot', 'warmth', 'charm', 'role', 'also', 'shares', 'ever-present', 'chemistry', 'lead', 'actors', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Kinnear', 'role', 'just', 'be', 'sap', 'Jackman', 'ideal', 'quot', 'quot', 'sparring', 'sessions', 'Judd', 'provide', 'very', 'comical', 'laughter', 'Not', 'only', 'believe', 'sparks', 'well.In', 'long', 'line', 'mature', 'comedies', 'take', 'battle', 'sexes', 'quot', 'Someone', 'quot', 'up', 'winner', 'spontaneity', 'wit', 'full', 'charm', 'breezy', 'laughter', 'end', 'even', 'had', 'left', 'were', 'actors', 'ability', 'keep', 'entertained', 'characters', 'grief', 'shenanigans', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'very', 'refreshing', 'hit']",Someone Like You

Just one of the many, quite funny, but intended to be cute, lines in this movie, which...wasn't very good.BUT HEY!! I knew it wasn't going to be good. Y'see I was staying at a hotel and I love ordering movies, and they just didn't have that much of a selection. So, it was either Enemy at the Gates, a risky watch in my book, or a stupid romantic comedy that I could laugh at.Guess what I picked.So yeah, Ashly Judd is REALLY hot, so that was always nice. She really does have one of the prettiest smiles in the business. But she kept trying to be sort of Meg Ryan goffy and quirky, which became annoying on several occasions. Y'know she'd act like a five yr old. And I thought the the relationship between Marrisa Tomei and her seemed a little forced. And her big speech on TV at the end was completely ridiculous and anticlimactic. Very unsatisfying. And Ellen Barkin had a totall ridiculous role as well. Her speech about how she wooed her man back though was really great. &quot;Two pastrami sandwhiches...lightly toasted.&quot; Just priceless.So that was the bad stuff, and there was more than that too, but there was, to be fair, some good stuff. Mainly, and you'll like this Rino, Hugh Jackman. I thought he was great. So much fun to watch. A real prescence.  And funny too. He was great as the &quot;wounded&quot; womanizing roommate.

With so much storyline potential, there never was enough character development to truly engage the viewer.  I kept wanting to know more about why Hugh Jackman's womanizing character Eddie was the way he was; we are given only a small taste of what drives him.  The superbly talented Jackman, however, makes the most of his role, bringing to his character more depth than I thought possible in such a superficially written role.  The story is predictable, but there's not necessarily anything wrong with that; watching it, you want it to end the way you know it's going to end.Ashley Judd is immensely likeable as Jane in the first light romantic comedy role I've ever seen her in, and Greg Kinnear is spot-on as the guy who creates Jane's emotional turmoil.  Ellen Barkin appears to have had the most fun in her role as a ratings-hungry talk-show host.  Judd and Jackman have excellent on-screen chemistry.

660563,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005K3OI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Even the movie title's bland, am I right? When it was first being pitched, a romantic comedy featuring Ashley Judd and Hugh Jackman probably sounded like a solid no-brainer. But, without a good script, it not quite falls apart, but it does leave one with a feeling of ""Err. Huh. What?"" In the end SOMEONE LIKE YOU is a nice light romantic comedy, nothing more, nothing less. Something maybe worth catching on cable TV, but I don't know that I'd shell out money for the DVD. I didn't mind watching it, but the flaws were right there in your face.Ashley Judd plays Jane, a producer on a daytime talk show and she thinks she'd met that special someone. Never mind that this guy (Greg Kinnear) already has a girlfriend. Jane and this guy hang out, hook up, get serious. But, on the verge of their moving in together into a new apartment, the guy breaks up with Jane. With Jane's old apartment already leased out to someone else, she takes up her co-worker Eddie's offer and becomes his platonic roomie in his spacious loft studio. And since Eddie (Jackman) is an unapologetic womanizer, Jane's regard for the opposite sex plummets even faster. One day, Jane reads an article in the paper and comes up with the ""new cow"" theory, this basically suggesting that a man always gets bored with banging the same woman and will always look for greener pastures. As a plot device to propel the story, it sucks. Instead of the lame pop psychology, a more apt theory is the one raised inWhen Harry Met Sally, which dictates that men and women can't be only friends.Ashley Judd is sweet and yearning, and cute when her character is throwing a tantrum, and that one scene in which she performs a cheerleading routine while dressed in only her sexy scanties, well, that goes a ways in redeeming the movie for me. Hugh Jackman, back then fresh off playing the brutish and smelly Wolverine in X-MEN, doesn't come off as brutish or smelly here. This was before he landed those other romantic lead roles (Kate & Leopold,Australia) and before he hosted the Oscars - and I think most of us missed his star turn in OKLAHOMA! - so SOMEONE LIKE YOU may've been the first time we've seen him be all casually charming and cosmopolitan. Anyway, the two leads do the best they can with the shoddy material they're given, and they're appealing enough and go well enough together that they just about overcome a weak and lifeless plot. The supporting cast is good, and I can never get enough of Ellen Barkin and Marisa Tomei. Greg Kinnear is really excellent at playing the quietly sleazy part.I like that Ashley Judd doesn't come off as too much of a weepy victim. But then she does get obsessed with drawing parallels between men and the bovine kingdom. She ends up publishing an article regarding her ""studies"" under the pseudonym of a much older woman. The kicker is that this article takes off and the mysterious author then becomes a much-in-demand guest star for the talk show circuit. It's dang uninvolving, the way this whole thing plays out, and the movie loses even more points for utilizing this plot device to resolve everything. The biggest flaw, though, is that the romance between the two leads comes out of nowhere. The film really could've done with more key moments to establish and develop Jane and Eddie's relationship. For most of the movie, Jane despises Eddie for his hound dog behavior, and Eddie just seems to cruise along his own merry way, bopping chicks left and right and not demonstrating one whiff of romantic interest for Jane. Then, late in the flick, Jane realizes that she loves him, and vicey-versy. It's a heck of a leap, and there's nothing truly suggested in Eddie's character that would indicate he's become a one-woman dude.I do like the switcheroo aspect in that Kinnear's character is regarded initially as the sensitive, thoughtful guy only for him to turn out to be a weasely scuzzbucket. And then there's Jackman's Eddie, on the surface a shallow one-night-stand kind of cat but who does have a chivalrous side. And did I mention Ashley Judd in her undies jumping up and down doing a cheer? It's what makes this fluffy film relevant to me. Heck, I may end up buying the DVD after all.",3,an udder dudder?,1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,4198,"['Even', 'movie', 'title', 'bland', 'am', 'right', 'When', 'was', 'first', 'being', 'pitched', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'featuring', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'probably', 'sounded', 'solid', 'no-brainer', 'good', 'script', 'not', 'quite', 'apart', 'leave', 'one', 'feeling', 'Err', 'Huh', 'What', 'end', 'SOMEONE', 'LIKE', 'YOU', 'nice', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'Something', 'maybe', 'worth', 'catching', 'cable', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'shell', 'out', 'money', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'flaws', 'were', 'right', 'there', 'face.Ashley', 'Judd', 'Jane', 'producer', 'daytime', 'talk', 'show', ""'d"", 'met', 'special', 'someone', 'mind', 'guy', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'already', 'girlfriend', 'Jane', 'guy', 'out', 'hook', 'up', 'get', 'serious', 'verge', 'moving', 'together', 'new', 'apartment', 'guy', 'up', 'Jane', 'Jane', 'old', 'apartment', 'already', 'leased', 'out', 'someone', 'else', 'up', 'co-worker', 'Eddie', 'offer', 'platonic', 'roomie', 'spacious', 'loft', 'studio', 'Eddie', 'Jackman', 'unapologetic', 'womanizer', 'Jane', 'regard', 'opposite', 'sex', 'plummets', 'even', 'faster', 'One', 'day', 'Jane', 'article', 'paper', 'up', 'new', 'cow', 'theory', 'basically', 'suggesting', 'man', 'always', 'bored', 'banging', 'same', 'woman', 'will', 'always', 'look', 'greener', 'pastures', 'plot', 'device', 'propel', 'story', 'Instead', 'lame', 'pop', 'psychology', 'more', 'apt', 'theory', 'one', 'raised', 'inWhen', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'men', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'friends.Ashley', 'Judd', 'sweet', 'yearning', 'cute', 'when', 'character', 'throwing', 'tantrum', 'one', 'scene', 'cheerleading', 'routine', 'dressed', 'only', 'sexy', 'scanties', 'well', 'ways', 'redeeming', 'movie', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'back', 'then', 'fresh', 'off', 'playing', 'brutish', 'smelly', 'Wolverine', 'X-MEN', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'brutish', 'smelly', 'here', 'was', 'landed', 'other', 'romantic', 'lead', 'roles', 'Kate', 'Leopold', 'Australia', 'hosted', 'Oscars', 'think', 'most', 'missed', 'star', 'turn', 'OKLAHOMA', 'so', 'SOMEONE', 'LIKE', 'YOU', 'may', ""'ve"", 'been', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'be', 'casually', 'charming', 'cosmopolitan', 'Anyway', 'two', 'leads', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'shoddy', 'material', ""'re"", 'given', ""'re"", 'appealing', 'enough', 'go', 'well', 'enough', 'together', 'just', 'overcome', 'weak', 'lifeless', 'plot', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'enough', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'really', 'excellent', 'playing', 'quietly', 'sleazy', 'part.I', 'Ashley', 'Judd', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'too', 'much', 'weepy', 'victim', 'then', 'get', 'obsessed', 'drawing', 'parallels', 'men', 'bovine', 'kingdom', 'up', 'publishing', 'article', 'regarding', 'studies', 'pseudonym', 'much', 'older', 'woman', 'kicker', 'article', 'mysterious', 'author', 'then', 'much-in-demand', 'guest', 'star', 'talk', 'show', 'circuit', 'dang', 'uninvolving', 'way', 'whole', 'thing', 'out', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'points', 'utilizing', 'plot', 'device', 'resolve', 'everything', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'romance', 'two', 'leads', 'nowhere', 'film', 'really', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'more', 'key', 'moments', 'establish', 'develop', 'Jane', 'Eddie', 'relationship', 'most', 'movie', 'Jane', 'Eddie', 'hound', 'dog', 'behavior', 'Eddie', 'just', 'cruise', 'own', 'merry', 'way', 'bopping', 'chicks', 'left', 'right', 'not', 'demonstrating', 'one', 'whiff', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Jane', 'Then', 'late', 'flick', 'Jane', 'vicey-versy', 'heck', 'leap', 'nothing', 'truly', 'suggested', 'Eddie', 'character', 'would', 'indicate', 'become', 'one-woman', 'dude.I', 'do', 'switcheroo', 'aspect', 'Kinnear', 'character', 'regarded', 'initially', 'sensitive', 'thoughtful', 'guy', 'only', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'weasely', 'scuzzbucket', 'then', 'Jackman', 'Eddie', 'surface', 'shallow', 'one-night-stand', 'kind', 'cat', 'who', 'have', 'chivalrous', 'side', 'did', 'mention', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'undies', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'doing', 'cheer', 'what', 'fluffy', 'film', 'relevant', 'Heck', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'DVD']",Someone Like You

It's not your typical girl meets boy, they don't like each other, then they fall in love routine.  This one is a threesome of sorts, which adds an interesting angle ... or triangle as the case may be.  Ashley Judd plays PR person (or something of that nature - her title isn't named) Jane Goodall for a sleazy Sally-Jessie-esque talkshow in NYC. Ellen Barkin turns in a very good performance as the sleazy talkshow host. Also working at this talkshow set are Ray (Greg Kinnear) and Eddie (Hugh Jackman).  Kinnear's boyish good looks and charm make it easy to believe that Judd's character falls in love with him quickly, but make a little surprising to find that he's such a pig ... er, bull.  The animal comparisons that underlie the entire plot add a lot of spice to this quintessential chick flick.  And I do mean chick flick, if ever there was one.  This is one of those movies where women who have ever had their hearts broken can cheer Judd on in her emotional journey (and breakdown).  Men without a sense of humor may be a bit offended or take exception to the premise, but all comes out well in the end as in all romantic comedies. Hugh Jackman gives a stellar performance as a hunky womanizer with a sensitive side.  Ashley Judd is her usual perky, plucky, sweet self in this film, and her comedic timing is good too.  Greg Kinnear, as previously mentioned, was a good choice for his role as the third main character in this love triangle. Also worth mentioning is the lesser part played by Marissa Tomei, as Jane's best friend Liz.  Tomei is as good as ever, even in this small supporting role -- and so adorable!

That said, I do appreciate drama for it's own sake, and there's enough of that here that it didn't put me to sleep.  I can believe in and even laugh at love mistakes, but I felt like the characters were trying too hard to deliver their punch lines.  Here's my plot summary, without divulging all.Girl meets Mr. Right and is swept off her feet.  On the brink of cohabitation he announces he must go back to his wife/fiancee who (in unbelievable hijinks) turns out to be the girl's boss.  Our protagonist next proceeds to move in with a man she loathes (a co-worker), who's had (and is having) so many sex partners he qualifies as a walking condom ad.  Meanwhile our protagonist's girlfriend and she cook up a clever scheme for web-publishing her complaints about the man who dumped her and rationalizing his feckless infidelity must be linked to the breeding habits of the male of the species of domestic bovines.  The bull in her 'study' only mates once with each cow in the herd, afterward having nothing to do with each ""old"" cow.  It sounds funny enoughLastly, the girls concoct a virtual identity for her authorship, adopting the internet persona of a European style Dr. Ruth (a sex therapist),  to lend a bit of trumped up Hippocratic authority to her diatribe.  Against all odds she falls for Mr. Condom king when her compassion is awakened by acquiring the insight that he too had fallen for that once-in-a-lifetime true love who became lost love.  That he too understood the crushing despair of an endless night, but that didn't force him to accept the loss alone.  To his amazement, he too finds himself vulnerable to her ingenuity and charm, to believing in she and he.[saccharine]  2. overly or sickishly sweet (--flavor)  3.  ingratiatingly or affectedly agreeable or friendly  4  overly sentimental : mawkish--[saccharinity]",3,"Beyond appearances, beware of imposters.",1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,1953,"['Billed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'enough', 'appreciate', 'attempted', 'humor', 'said', 'do', 'appreciate', 'drama', 'own', 'sake', 'enough', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'sleep', 'can', 'believe', 'even', 'laugh', 'love', 'mistakes', 'felt', 'characters', 'were', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'deliver', 'punch', 'lines', 'Here', 'plot', 'summary', 'divulging', 'all.Girl', 'meets', 'Mr', 'Right', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'brink', 'cohabitation', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'wife/fiancee', 'who', 'unbelievable', 'hijinks', 'out', 'be', 'girl', 'boss', 'protagonist', 'next', 'proceeds', 'move', 'man', 'co-worker', 'who', 'had', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'sex', 'partners', 'walking', 'condom', 'ad', 'Meanwhile', 'protagonist', 'girlfriend', 'cook', 'up', 'clever', 'scheme', 'web-publishing', 'complaints', 'man', 'who', 'dumped', 'rationalizing', 'feckless', 'infidelity', 'must', 'be', 'linked', 'breeding', 'habits', 'male', 'species', 'domestic', 'bovines', 'bull', ""'study"", 'only', 'once', 'cow', 'herd', 'afterward', 'having', 'nothing', 'do', 'old', 'cow', 'funny', 'enoughLastly', 'girls', 'concoct', 'virtual', 'identity', 'authorship', 'adopting', 'internet', 'persona', 'European', 'style', 'Dr.', 'Ruth', 'sex', 'therapist', 'lend', 'bit', 'trumped', 'up', 'Hippocratic', 'authority', 'diatribe', 'odds', 'Mr', 'Condom', 'king', 'when', 'compassion', 'awakened', 'acquiring', 'insight', 'too', 'had', 'fallen', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'true', 'love', 'who', 'became', 'lost', 'love', 'too', 'understood', 'crushing', 'despair', 'endless', 'night', 'did', ""n't"", 'force', 'accept', 'loss', 'alone', 'amazement', 'too', 'vulnerable', 'ingenuity', 'charm', 'believing', '[', 'saccharine', '2.', 'overly', 'sickishly', 'sweet', 'flavor', '3.', 'ingratiatingly', 'affectedly', 'agreeable', 'friendly', '4', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'mawkish', '[', 'saccharinity', ']']",Someone Like You

660576,AEIPZ7QBQ9OIL,B00005K3OI,Keaton Fan,"[6, 7]","The three main actors are perfectly cast. Ashley Judd plays Jane just right; a woman obsessed, yet a sympathetic character (who hasn't become obsessed over a breakup?). Greg Kinnear is perfect as the cheating, lying Ray, especially in the scenes where Ray puts a look of exaggerated emotion on his face, in an attempt to make himself believable.When Jane moves in with Eddie, arguments are sparked over their respective attitudes towards relationships, but they have no problem coexisting in the same space. There are no arguments over cleaning the kitchen/bathroom/living room, no sniping about who left the front door unlocked, none of the usual friction that occurs between roommates, especially when one of them has lived in the apartment for some time and the other one is a newcomer.Eddie and Jane, obviously, have different approaches to being dumped. Jane bemoans her fate and tries to find a reason for Ray's behavior in her books about animals. Eddie doesn't look for reasons, doesn't wait for his ex to magically return, and doesn't get into another relationship immediately. We don't know how long it's been since his girlfriend left him, but we know that his grief was so strong, he took an axe and chopped a hole in the wall of his spare room. Very powerful stuff for a man who's supposed to be unable to stay with one woman.One of the reasons the movie works is that the two main characters learn from each other in recovering from their breakups. Eddie, in particular, draws in his own pain to help Jane with hers. ""It's over! Over! Why can't you just let it go?"" he asks her.The real ace here is Hugh Jackman as Eddie, initially regarded by Jane as simply a womanizer, the stuff of legend around the office. Jackman faces a very difficult task in making Eddie not only believable, but sympathetic. The ""womanizing coworker"" has been done to death in film; Jackman's carefully shaded performance makes Eddie a real person. Eddie is never seen ogling a strange woman on the street, bragging about his sexual conquests, or behaving in any way as though he thinks he's superior to the women he beds night after night. There's nothing sleazy about him, and that's amazing.Jackman successfully walks a fine line here; the movie is worth it for his performance alone. I wish they'd left the other ending, the one you can see on the DVD. It's much better and it really sizzles, making full use of the chemistry between the two leads.",5,5 stars for Jackman's performance,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,2442,"['three', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Jane', 'just', 'right', 'woman', 'obsessed', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'become', 'obsessed', 'breakup', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'perfect', 'cheating', 'lying', 'Ray', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'Ray', 'look', 'exaggerated', 'emotion', 'face', 'attempt', 'make', 'believable.When', 'Jane', 'moves', 'Eddie', 'arguments', 'are', 'sparked', 'respective', 'attitudes', 'towards', 'relationships', 'have', 'problem', 'coexisting', 'same', 'space', 'are', 'arguments', 'cleaning', 'kitchen/bathroom/living', 'room', 'sniping', 'who', 'left', 'front', 'door', 'unlocked', 'none', 'usual', 'friction', 'roommates', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'lived', 'apartment', 'time', 'other', 'one', 'newcomer.Eddie', 'Jane', 'obviously', 'have', 'different', 'approaches', 'being', 'dumped', 'Jane', 'fate', 'tries', 'find', 'reason', 'Ray', 'behavior', 'books', 'animals', 'Eddie', ""n't"", 'look', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'wait', 'ex', 'magically', 'return', ""n't"", 'get', 'relationship', 'immediately', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'know', 'grief', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'took', 'axe', 'chopped', 'hole', 'wall', 'spare', 'room', 'Very', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'man', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'unable', 'stay', 'one', 'woman.One', 'reasons', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'learn', 'other', 'recovering', 'breakups', 'Eddie', 'particular', 'own', 'pain', 'help', 'Jane', 'hers', 'over', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'let', 'go', 'her.The', 'real', 'ace', 'here', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Eddie', 'initially', 'regarded', 'Jane', 'simply', 'womanizer', 'stuff', 'legend', 'office', 'Jackman', 'very', 'difficult', 'task', 'making', 'Eddie', 'not', 'only', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'womanizing', 'coworker', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'film', 'Jackman', 'carefully', 'shaded', 'performance', 'Eddie', 'real', 'person', 'Eddie', 'never', 'seen', 'ogling', 'strange', 'woman', 'street', 'bragging', 'sexual', 'conquests', 'behaving', 'way', 'superior', 'women', 'night', 'night', 'nothing', 'sleazy', 'amazing.Jackman', 'successfully', 'walks', 'fine', 'line', 'here', 'movie', 'performance', 'alone', 'wish', ""'d"", 'left', 'other', 'ending', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'really', 'making', 'full', 'use', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads']",Someone Like You

In the aftermath, she comes up with &quot;Old/New Cow&quot; theory--essentially, that a man who has slept with a woman will thereafter get tired of her and move on to a &quot;new cow&quot;.  Unlike the book, which details this theory in endless prose, the film cleverly uses titles and visuals of scientists testing this theory.Ashley Judd isn't going to give Meg Ryan any fears about being dethroned as the romantic comedy heroine of choice.  But Judd is charming, intelligent, and quirky as the female lead, and Hugh Jackman is attractive and testosterine-filled as the womanizing Eddie, who eventually becomes Jane's roommate.One minor quibble, and that's that the movie changes the ending of the book somewhat to give a somewhat artificially happy ending.

660589,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005K3OI,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","Someone Like You is a romantic comedy that tries to be innovative but winds up being about as bland as they come. This doesn't mean that it's an unpleasant way to spend an evening. It means it's forgettable. It is like one of those people you meet at a party who is nice enough to be around but whose face you can't remember the next day.Romantic comedy is a tricky genre. If you stick closely to the formula, you risk making a totally uninspired movie. If you tinker too much with the recipe, you risk losing the audience because it is a subject where people tend to want to see the same story over and over again, only slightly differently each time. Occasionally, there's a successful variation, as in 1997's delightful romp, My Best Friend's Wedding, where girl met boy, girl lost boy, girl tried everything to get boy back but lost him anyway. Such movies don't endanger the formula, though, because we almost always want the couple to wind up together.Someone Like You's device is the old love triangle. Jane [Ashley Judd] works for a New York TV talk show. The show is about to go national, and Jane's one of the people responsible for making this transition a success. She's a girl who's looking for a long term relationship, and she is appalled by Eddie [Hugh Jackman], a coworker who makes conquest after conquest with female members of the staff. She seems to be the lone holdout. Ray [Greg Kinnear] arrives as the show's new producer. He seems so gentle and understanding, and Jane is instantly attracted to him. Soon, they begin a serious affair and decided to move in together. Just as Jane is about to move out of her apartment, Ray gets cold feet. Angry and hurt, Jane impulsively agrees to move in with the notorious Eddie, hoping to have her revenge on Ray. Jane and Eddie vow to be platonic with each other. Will Jane get Ray back? Or will Eddie show her he has another side to him, one that's much more appealing?There is a subplot in the movie that might have seemed hilarious on paper. It doesn't translate well to the screen. While watching TV documentaries about the mating habits of various mammals, Jane learns that a bull will not mate with a cow he's already done it with. He needs a new cow. In one of the great leaps for sociology and anthropology, Jane concludes that this behavior explains why men cannot be faithful. Using a pen name, she writes about it in a column for a magazine, and, this being a movie, she's syndicated in three hundred newspapers a week later. This causes a lot of problems for Jane. It's also trouble for the audience because the idea is so fundamentally weak. If this is the reason men can't be faithful, then it's a natural phenomenon, so why are we still worrying about it?As has often the case in recent movies of this type, a supporting role steals the show. Ellen Barkin plays Diane Roberts, the host of the talk show. She's ambitious, self-centered and wise. She's also very funny and a lot more interesting than the main characters. Her performance alone is worth giving She's the One a look.",3,This is a little to bland for my taste,1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,3057,"['Someone', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'be', 'innovative', 'up', 'being', 'as', 'bland', 'come', ""n't"", 'mean', 'unpleasant', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'forgettable', 'one', 'people', 'meet', 'party', 'who', 'nice', 'enough', 'be', 'around', 'face', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'next', 'day.Romantic', 'comedy', 'tricky', 'genre', 'stick', 'closely', 'formula', 'risk', 'making', 'totally', 'uninspired', 'movie', 'tinker', 'too', 'much', 'recipe', 'risk', 'losing', 'audience', 'subject', 'where', 'people', 'tend', 'want', 'see', 'same', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'only', 'slightly', 'differently', 'time', 'Occasionally', 'successful', 'variation', '1997', 'delightful', 'romp', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'where', 'girl', 'met', 'boy', 'girl', 'lost', 'boy', 'girl', 'tried', 'everything', 'get', 'boy', 'back', 'lost', 'anyway', 'Such', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'endanger', 'formula', 'though', 'almost', 'always', 'want', 'couple', 'wind', 'up', 'together.Someone', 'device', 'old', 'love', 'triangle', 'Jane', '[', 'Ashley', 'Judd', ']', 'New', 'York', 'TV', 'talk', 'show', 'show', 'go', 'national', 'Jane', 'one', 'people', 'responsible', 'making', 'transition', 'success', 'girl', 'who', 'looking', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'appalled', 'Eddie', '[', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', ']', 'coworker', 'who', 'conquest', 'conquest', 'female', 'members', 'staff', 'be', 'lone', 'holdout', 'Ray', '[', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', ']', 'show', 'new', 'producer', 'so', 'gentle', 'understanding', 'Jane', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'Soon', 'begin', 'serious', 'affair', 'decided', 'move', 'together', 'Just', 'Jane', 'move', 'out', 'apartment', 'Ray', 'cold', 'feet', 'Angry', 'hurt', 'Jane', 'impulsively', 'move', 'notorious', 'Eddie', 'hoping', 'have', 'revenge', 'Ray', 'Jane', 'Eddie', 'vow', 'be', 'platonic', 'other', 'Will', 'Jane', 'get', 'Ray', 'back', 'will', 'Eddie', 'show', 'side', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'appealing', 'subplot', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'hilarious', 'paper', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'screen', 'watching', 'TV', 'documentaries', 'mating', 'habits', 'various', 'mammals', 'Jane', 'bull', 'will', 'not', 'mate', 'cow', 'already', 'done', 'new', 'cow', 'one', 'great', 'leaps', 'sociology', 'anthropology', 'Jane', 'behavior', 'why', 'men', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faithful', 'Using', 'pen', 'name', 'column', 'magazine', 'being', 'movie', 'syndicated', 'three', 'hundred', 'newspapers', 'week', 'later', 'lot', 'problems', 'Jane', 'also', 'trouble', 'audience', 'idea', 'so', 'fundamentally', 'weak', 'reason', 'men', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faithful', 'then', 'natural', 'phenomenon', 'so', 'why', 'are', 'still', 'worrying', 'often', 'case', 'recent', 'movies', 'type', 'supporting', 'role', 'steals', 'show', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Diane', 'Roberts', 'host', 'talk', 'show', 'ambitious', 'self-centered', 'wise', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'main', 'characters', 'performance', 'alone', 'worth', 'giving', 'One', 'look']",Someone Like You

I kind of thank God for that.  It's not really worth the 6 or 7 bucks one pays for a ticket.  I'm not saying it's totally worthless, don't get me wrong, I mean it's not painful.....it's just not what I expected.The storyline focuses on Jane Goodale (played by the engaging Ashley Judd, the only reason this film stays on it's feet,) a beautiful woman, who has gone through relationship after relationship and has just not been successful.  Well, one day while at work with her womaizer friend, Eddie (Hugh Jackman, who plays this role with as much enthusiasm as a rock laying in the middle of a field,) she meets the man-of-her dreams (Greg Kinnear, who shouldn't have been selected to play the role...he's got no chemistry what-so-ever with Ashley, and neither does Hugh Jackman, which I had forgotten to mention.) Well, of course, he is taken, but she manages to snag a few dates with him and they end up going out and sleeping together...etc. One day he decides that they should move in together, after he tells his girlfriend that it's over.  Jane packs up her bags and tells her landlord she's moving, but after 2 weeks she finds out that her boyfriend does not feel right about dumping his girlfriend, and he dumps her, too.  Jane has no where to go, and she ends up moving in with Eddie.  Well, I bet ya can't guess what happens next.  They fall in &quot;love.&quot;  Like I said, it is not a believable love, because there's no chemistry.. And for a film like this with a weak script, and only a select few good performances, there HAS to be chemistry.

660613,A3GB6RKLASF9HB,B00005K3OI,"R. Kearns-White ""rockiw""","[1, 1]","""Someone Like You"" is a short and likable romantic comedy based on the novel ""Animal Husbandry"" by Laura Zigman. In order to make it a more palatable movie, director Tony Goldwyn de-fanged the sharp bite of the book where all men are deemed scum and there is no happy, Hollywood romantic pairing waiting for heroine Jane Goodale (played by Ashley Judd on screen). But to the benefit of the film, toning down the book's bile makes Jane less an unlikable, dithering neurotic and more of a likable kook.Ashley Judd does an excellent job with the script by combining emotional vulnerability and a solid comedic presence. She is at all times cute and adorable without sending a viewer into sugar shock. Hugh Jackman, in his first post-X-men role, brings a certain roguish charm and charisma to the chain-smoking and chain-f***ing Eddie. Besides her co-worker and roommate, Eddie is also Jane Goodale's living, breathing proof of her wacky theory that men are neophiliacs, and lose interest in women once they have ""been serviced."" (She calls this her New Cow theory.).When Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both on screen, the chemistry between them crackle. It adds a depth and nuance to their performances and characters' development. Too bad we are denied the pleasure of seeing them consummate their eventual (and very obvious) romantic pairing.Greg Kinnear does a good job of combining slimy and sincere as the man who breaks Jane's heart, and starts her spiraling toward her New Cow theory. Marisa Tomei steals every scene she is in as Jane's enabler, best buddy, and fellow soldier in the romantic war. Marisa's chain-smoking Liz makes one wish that the movie was from her point of view, and that we could have watched cynical Liz trade verbal jabs and longing looks with Jackman's equally cynical Eddie.The subplot concerning Alice's, Jane's sister,  infertility troubles doesn't add much to the plot of the movie except to show at least one man (Stephen, played by Peter Friedman) in a steady and monogamous relationship. Catherine Dent, who plays Danni in the F/X drama The Shield and Jane's sister, has the best line in the movie: ""If you can't stick [that needle] in a Valencia, how are you going to stick in my ass?""""Someone Like You"" isn't as forgettable as the lame title suggests, because of top notch performances of its stars and some memorable lines.

Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear) has just been hired from a Washington station as the new Producer. Eddie Alden (Hugh Jackman) is the writer/director of the show. Jane falls in love with Ray. Ray asks her to move in with him. Ray gets cold feet. Jane develops a theory about cows (don't ask). Jane becomes Eddie's roommate. Jane's attraction to womanizer Eddie grows as she also reconsiders Ray.""Someone Like You"" is your basic girl-meets-boy-boy-becomes-jerk-can't-decide-whether-attractive-womanizer-is-the-right-guy story. We have all seen this story hundreds, if not thousands of times. If ""Someone Like You"" were just that, it would be a pleasant diversion starring attractive actors.Unfortunately, Jane comes up with a theory about cows and their mating rituals. She finds that they are very similar to that of humans. Huh! Jane is the very young talent booker on a syndicated talk show. How did she become such an expert in biology? She buys a lot of books at Barnes and Noble and then lays on top of them. You think I'm kidding.Because the ludicrous 'theories' that Jane Goodale (get it?) comes up with are referred to repeatedly, they completely undermine any chance that we might have to get to know or believe the characters were real. The theories keep bringing us out of the story.Judd and Jackman are both very attractive and manage to generate some chemistry. Unfortunately, this is one of those stories in which we never see them kiss until the very end. I'm not really revealing anything here. You can tell this will happen from the very beginning.""Someone Like You"" is supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet I only laughed a couple of times throughout. Not very successful. It is also a classic example of a 'chick flick'. However, calling ""Someone..."" a chick flick is as insulting as calling ""Exit Wounds"" a guy film. Neither film is any good and prescribing them to a particular group only insults that group. More accurately, ""Someone Like You"" is just a bad film.

The beginning is with the very original cow theory showing real cows and scientists and in a way promising us that this is not going to be just another regular love story.

Somewhere along this line you get hooked until the once again banal (and too dramatized) ending.All in all fun and entertaining to watch but not one of the best romantic comedies. Ashley Judd as the dumped lady is lovely and is a good excuse to watch this film. I liked this actress since watching her in ""where the heart is"", but I have to say she does not really look miserable, or maybe I wish I looked like her when I was miserable (actually, I would not mind looking like that when I am happy either). Other then that I could not stand Gregg Kinnear as the love object, he seemed too pathetic to win anybody's heart. I liked him a whole lot better as the neighbor in ""As good as it gets"" - in that movie his pathetic expressions seemed to fit the role.

660633,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005K3OI,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","&quot;Someone Like You&quot; means Ashley Judd, no matter how its script implies.  Her charming smile accompanied with skillful acting is the best thing you can find in this movie.  Fans, enjoy it.Still, &quot;Someone Like You&quot; is a little disappointing.  The movie makes you feel good, certainly, and supporting cast is good (though Greg Kinnear seems typecast after &quot;Nurse  Betty,&quot; &quot;Sabrina,&quot; and others) and the beautiful location shots of New York City is impressive.  However, we have seen a film with a better script this year (2001) and because of this fact, one star drops.  And the film is, of course, &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary.&quot;Both movies goes on the similar course during their running time.  Two guys and a working woman; she loves one guy, but comes to know that he doesn't love her; then she finds another love, and during the course she struggles hard to make her career....  The critics' lukewarm reception of &quot;Someone Like You&quot; is fairly understandable, if slightly unfair.  Even without this comparison, the flaw (probably the only flaw I can find) of &quot;Someone Like You&quot; is clear; it gives nothing new.  And if you start to think about &quot;Dairy,&quot; you might all the more miss the witty script of the latter movie.Having said that, &quot;Someone Like You&quot; is a likable and funny film that promises you to have a good time.  Judd's strangely convincing &quot;Bull-Cow Theory&quot; is funny, and for me the best part of the story is the conclusion of the film -- humans are NOT bulls nor cows.  Some people theorize on human relationships in a bleak way, but &quot;Someone Like You&quot; assures that we are all humans, not animals.  (British title of the film happens to be &quot;Animal Attraction.&quot;  Oh....)  Besides ever-wonderful Judd, Hugh Jackman displays his deft performance for romantic comedy, and you can try to spot Ashley's real-life mother.  And the most unexpected joy is to watch (though briefly) Judd plays a cheerleader in an unusual situation.
