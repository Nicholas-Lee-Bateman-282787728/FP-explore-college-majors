The plights of some of the street people who populate the film--black, white, brown--as well as the struggles of those who attempt to work with them, are sure to make viewers reconsider this ever-growing problem in our country. The film deserves much more recognition.",5,Welcome to the Real,1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,381,"['brilliant', 'little', 'documentary', 'made', 'reviewer', 'comments', 'courageous', 'committed', 'people', 'plights', 'street', 'people', 'who', 'populate', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'brown', 'as', 'well', 'struggles', 'who', 'attempt', 'work', 'are', 'sure', 'make', 'viewers', 'reconsider', 'ever-growing', 'problem', 'country', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'recognition']",Skid Row

Yet that's exactly what we middle-class folks do when it comes to the homeless! LA's problem is much worse than I thought, however you can find this situation in most cities around the world. Drugs, mental illness and a society that just doesn't give a darn feed into the problem! I live in a big city and see these types on a regular basis. You learn to ignore them.

1129955,A2GRKG9CERAI1S,B001152TLG,"John Doe ""Mutant (AKA_Homo Superior)""","[3, 10]","In the 1st day, Pras made around $20 in a short time begging. Pras has gotten the art of begging down and was getting into the hang of begging.  Pras seems to have a natural talent for begging.  But that should not really be a surprise as it takes a certain talent in begging & salesmanship for Pras to rise to the top of his field.  You can tell how proud Pras was of his begging skill from the gleam in his eyes.  I would not be surprise that he was thinking after this movie shooting was over, he would probably dress up in bums clothes and go out begging again to keep his begging skill in shape.  Unfortunately for Pras, his begging career will be short live.The Beggar Clan did not like Pras muscling into their territory so they reported him. Thus a black & white stop by and gave him a warning. As Pras is not organized like the Beggar Clan, Pras did not have a police lookout and must stop begging.In the next couple of days, you will see a couples of criminal activities being committed and not reported. One man was being assaulted and so was another woman. Of course you have the illegal activities of drug uses.A University study shows that 2 out of 3 of the homeless are convicted criminals.  And with Skid Row being around 1 miles South of the twin tower jail, quite a few of these homeless are criminals release from twin tower jail nearby with no where to go and that is why they are out there on Skid Row.Pras forgot that these are criminals he is dealing with, got careless and got his tent stolen and he had no place to stay. By the time he got his tent stolen, the Beggar Clan figures out who he is and they stay away from him and his crew. The homeless on the street did not show him the rope so he ends up staying at one of the Homeless Mission. He slips and that is how they figure out who he is. Can you see where he slips?After the beggar clan figures out who Pras is, all the criminal activities observed previously just disappear from the camera as when you shine lights on cockroaches, they will just scatter & disappear. The rest is just boring propaganda through deception, ruse & staging that you would see normally on television.But propaganda is to be expected. As you can't tell people to give you moneys for your Mission so you can pay yourself & your crew 6 figures and provide place for criminals to stay while they commit crime against the people to support their drug habits. If you listen carefully, you will notice that it was stated that some of the homeless, beggar clan, are able to generate $30,000 a months through criminal activities to support their drug addiction. Don't get puzzle if you did not notice the part about how some of these street/skid row people makes $30,000 a month the first time watching the video. I heard about it 20 years ago so I pick it up the first time watching the video.In the end, Pras was never shown the rope and will not see that side of the beggar clan since they figure out who he is.Don't quit your day job to work undercover or intellegence Pras.  As you will just blow your cover real fast or provide inaccurate intelligences and start another Iraq war by assserting that Iraq has weapon of Mass Destruction when you can't even recognize a weapon of Mass Deception.20/20, 60 Minutes and the History Channel had programs that had better undercover work & investigative news reporting than this DVD about Skid Row.Note:(1) In 2009, during the recession, Americans gave $304 billions to charities.  At the same time, the Mexico drug war that killed as many people as the Iraq war generated $32 billions.  Mathematically it proves that propagandas, deceptions, ruses & stagings are 9.5 times more effective than violences & killings (304/32=9.5).(2) And in 2012, Americans gave $335 billions to charities, thus propagandas, deceptions, ruses & stagings are much more effective than violences & killings----------------------------------------------------------------Update 09/14/2010I recently notice that there is a new campaign in homeless charity having to do with children.  Donations are asked to help homeless children.But under the law, it is illegal for minor under 18 yrs to be without parent or guardian.  If a minor does not have a parent, they must go to into a foster care system.  Thus if anyone see a child, whether homeless or not, without a parent or guardian they must report them to social service to be help.  Not exploit them like common criminals for charitable donations.Thus there seems to be a contradiction here between what is the law versus what homeless children campaign is promoting.  And this campaign seems to be going very well.As a master salesman once told me during my training, ""There is a sucker born every minutes...LOL :)"".

Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2Nine dollars and a tent - that's all hip-hop artist Pras Michel (of The Fugees) brings with him when he goes undercover to live on Skid Row disguised as a homeless person.  His purpose?  To experience first hand what life is like for those who live on the streets, and to share that experience with the world at large.  ""Skid Row"" documents the nine days and nights he spent trying to make it in the homeless capital of the world, Los Angeles.The movie hits us with a slew of depressing statistics and provides a brief history of the place, while Pras learns how to survive through begging and panhandling and by maneuvering his way through a world few of us will ever know - or even care to acknowledge. The movie, shot with a hidden camera, is a fairly straight-forward documentary, though the substandard sound recording makes some of the dialogue hard to make out.  But the message shines through in Pras' heartbreaking encounters with drug addicts, runaways, and friends and families of individuals who have gone missing and may be living on Skid Row.The enormity and seeming intractability of the problem can make watching this film an overwhelming experience for the viewer, but there are glimmers of hope in seeing how many of the individuals who work with the homeless were themselves down-and-out at one point in their lives (many are themselves recovering addicts), but somehow managed to pull themselves up and are now giving back to those they left behind.Pras and the others involved in the project deserve praise for their courage and gratitude for opening our eyes to this terrible human and social scourge that should concern us all.",3,Crude as filmmaking at times but gets its message across,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,1656,"['***1/2Nine', 'dollars', 'tent', 'hip-hop', 'artist', 'Pras', 'Michel', 'Fugees', 'when', 'undercover', 'live', 'Skid', 'Row', 'disguised', 'homeless', 'person', 'purpose', 'experience', 'first', 'hand', 'what', 'life', 'who', 'live', 'streets', 'share', 'experience', 'world', 'large', 'Skid', 'Row', 'documents', 'nine', 'days', 'nights', 'spent', 'trying', 'make', 'homeless', 'capital', 'world', 'Los', 'Angeles.The', 'movie', 'slew', 'depressing', 'statistics', 'brief', 'history', 'place', 'Pras', 'how', 'survive', 'begging', 'panhandling', 'maneuvering', 'way', 'world', 'few', 'will', 'ever', 'know', 'even', 'care', 'acknowledge', 'movie', 'shot', 'hidden', 'camera', 'fairly', 'straight-forward', 'documentary', 'substandard', 'sound', 'recording', 'dialogue', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'message', 'shines', 'Pras', 'heartbreaking', 'encounters', 'drug', 'addicts', 'runaways', 'friends', 'families', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'missing', 'may', 'be', 'living', 'Skid', 'Row.The', 'enormity', 'seeming', 'intractability', 'problem', 'can', 'make', 'watching', 'film', 'overwhelming', 'experience', 'viewer', 'are', 'glimmers', 'hope', 'seeing', 'how', 'many', 'individuals', 'who', 'work', 'homeless', 'were', 'down-and-out', 'one', 'point', 'lives', 'many', 'are', 'recovering', 'addicts', 'somehow', 'managed', 'pull', 'up', 'are', 'now', 'giving', 'back', 'left', 'behind.Pras', 'others', 'involved', 'project', 'deserve', 'praise', 'courage', 'gratitude', 'opening', 'eyes', 'terrible', 'human', 'social', 'scourge', 'should', 'concern']",Skid Row
