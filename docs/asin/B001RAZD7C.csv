Such a shame that Disney pulled the plug on the program after Year #2.  But within those 2 years we got to know the Masked Crusader with the flowing black cape and his alter-ego, Don Diego Delevaga (both portrayed by Guy Williams)...Diego's Dad (George Lewis), Diego's trusted servant, Bernardo (Gene Sheldon), Capitan Monastario (Phil Ross) and roly-poly Sergeant Garcia (Henry Calvin).  Garcia was usually the foil in many of these episodes. Capitan Monistario thought that his newest plan would finally capture Zorro and Garcia would inadvertently louse things up!There seems to be a little controversy about Season #2?  Was it shot in black + white or color?  The box of 5 DVDs represented here says: Color Digitally Mastered. Which could mean a colorization or a clean-up of an existing color print?  Either way it doesn't matter.  All of the full screen episodes look very good!  And many of the actors...including a very special mouseketeer who passed away in 2013...are fun to try and identify prior to the closing credits!This set was very enjoyable...particularly because I used all my Disney Rewards Points to obtain it.  If you're not so lucky, but enjoy self-contained tales about the early days of California and the hero who kept dreams alive...buy this set!  It's another reminder that Disney product continues to be very special.",5,Zorro in color?

Somehow the stories have lightened up a bit diminishing the sense of intensity drama and adventure.  Still the performances are top notch and there is plenty of good action. It's good to own the whole series, but given the choice, Season One was much stronger and complete unto itself. For many people Guy Williams is the definitive Zorro and he's done nothing to dishonor that claim. There have been many actors that played Zorro after Guy Williams, but only one was worthy to carry on the full glory of being Zorro, and the name of that man is...",3,ZORRO!
