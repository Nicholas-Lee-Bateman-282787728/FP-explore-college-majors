Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs.

829066,A2POYXTGSPSW7O,B0002A2W2C,Bill Hensler,"[11, 16]","Rod Sterling, writer and producer of the Twilight Zone, said of the shows he wrote that one third were bad, one third were fair, and one third were good.Combat, a show from about the same time frame as the Twilight Zone, reflects these three principals of being good, fair, or bad.I liked Combat, but not as much as I thought.  Why?  Time has make me into a more sophisticated viewer.  When I first saw this series I was no older than 7 years old.  Now after my own stint in the military and officers training I see the obvious flaws.  Yes, I like the show.  However, some of it will bug a viewer like it did to me.Vic Morrow plays a hard nosed infantry sergeant.  Basically, there is nothing wrong with his acting.  He does wear a camouflage steel pot cover.  That will bug any student of WWII.  The Waffen SS wore camouflage in Western Europe.  If you were seen wearing camouflage by allied forces you were shot.  The US Army had some soldiers land on D-Day wearing camouflage.  The results was a disaster.  Some company commander or first sergeant would have told the sergeant to take off his helmet camo cover.  After the first command a stripe would have been taken off with the cover.  In engagements the Army does not screw around.Now, what is really nice about Combat is the Germans all speak German.  That sounds like a little thing but in lots of TV shows and movies the Germans speak English with an accent.  Second, this TV show was shot in the early 1960s when there was still lots of German equipment.  You'll see K-98 rifles, more than a few MP-40s, converted Spandau machine guns, Panzerfausts, Panzershreiks, G-43s, and lots of original German WWII equipment and uniforms.  Amazon.com reader, that part is worth one star just to see the original equipment.  You will not see any MP-44s because that was a little too alien for most Americans to accept, the Germans had an assault rifle ahead of anybody else.Now, a bad thing is the show only has one tank assigned per episode.  The show takes an M-41 Bulldog tank and paint either a cross on it for German or a star on it for GI.  In the early 1960s the art of reproduction armor had not been invented yet.  Anyway, the T-34 was still a front line Warsaw block combat tank and their conversion to substitute Tiger tanks was at least seven years in the future with Clint Eastwood's movie ""Kelly's Heros"".  Another armor problem is the use of M-2/M-3 half tracks to substitute for the German SdKfz 251.  It does not work.  The Czech made OT-10, a copy of the SdKfz 251, was assigned to front line Warsaw pact units.What is weird about the DVD is you get to see one episode after the other.  So it's obvious they are using the same village (set) in one show after the other.  Conversely, the black and white works fine.  Why?  Most Army combat footage in WWII was shot in black and white.  So some of it can blend seamlessly into the various combat episodes.  There was one time they used film showing a German Wespe plastering the heck out of American positions.  That was pretty cool.Combat isn't a bad show.  It's just that time passed it by.  I bought my disks on discount and would never pay full price for the series.I gave the show four stars.  One third of the episodes are good.  One third are bad.  One third are fair.  The producers give you four disks.  You can play the episodes at once per disk or you can check the episodes and acts out each separately.  I did the later quite a bit.But Combat is now old and shows it.  It's enjoyable.  However, I would never pay full price for it.  The production compromises knock it down a full star.  The bad episodes drag it down.  But you'll enjoy yourself because you get a lot of shows in a set.Four stars",4,Not a bad series for its age,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,3725,"['Rod', 'Sterling', 'writer', 'producer', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'said', 'shows', 'wrote', 'one', 'were', 'bad', 'one', 'third', 'were', 'fair', 'one', 'were', 'good.Combat', 'show', 'same', 'time', 'frame', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'three', 'principals', 'being', 'good', 'fair', 'bad.I', 'liked', 'Combat', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'Why', 'Time', 'make', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'viewer', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'series', 'was', 'older', '7', 'years', 'old', 'Now', 'own', 'stint', 'military', 'officers', 'training', 'see', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'Yes', 'like', 'show', 'However', 'will', 'bug', 'viewer', 'did', 'me.Vic', 'Morrow', 'hard', 'nosed', 'infantry', 'sergeant', 'Basically', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'acting', 'wear', 'camouflage', 'steel', 'pot', 'cover', 'will', 'bug', 'student', 'WWII', 'Waffen', 'SS', 'wore', 'camouflage', 'Western', 'Europe', 'were', 'seen', 'wearing', 'camouflage', 'allied', 'forces', 'were', 'shot', 'US', 'Army', 'had', 'soldiers', 'land', 'D-Day', 'wearing', 'camouflage', 'results', 'was', 'disaster', 'company', 'commander', 'first', 'sergeant', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'sergeant', 'take', 'off', 'helmet', 'camo', 'cover', 'first', 'command', 'stripe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'off', 'cover', 'engagements', 'Army', 'not', 'screw', 'around.Now', 'what', 'really', 'nice', 'Combat', 'Germans', 'speak', 'German', 'little', 'thing', 'lots', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'Germans', 'speak', 'English', 'accent', 'Second', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'shot', 'early', '1960s', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'lots', 'German', 'equipment', ""'ll"", 'see', 'K-98', 'rifles', 'more', 'few', 'MP-40s', 'converted', 'Spandau', 'machine', 'guns', 'Panzerfausts', 'Panzershreiks', 'G-43s', 'lots', 'original', 'German', 'WWII', 'equipment', 'uniforms', 'Amazon.com', 'reader', 'part', 'worth', 'one', 'star', 'just', 'see', 'original', 'equipment', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'MP-44s', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'alien', 'most', 'Americans', 'accept', 'Germans', 'had', 'assault', 'rifle', 'ahead', 'anybody', 'else.Now', 'bad', 'thing', 'show', 'only', 'one', 'tank', 'assigned', 'episode', 'show', 'M-41', 'Bulldog', 'tank', 'paint', 'cross', 'German', 'star', 'GI', 'early', '1960s', 'art', 'reproduction', 'armor', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'invented', 'yet', 'Anyway', 'T-34', 'was', 'still', 'front', 'line', 'Warsaw', 'block', 'combat', 'tank', 'conversion', 'substitute', 'Tiger', 'tanks', 'was', 'least', 'seven', 'years', 'future', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'Kelly', 'Heros', 'armor', 'problem', 'use', 'M-2/M-3', 'half', 'tracks', 'substitute', 'German', 'SdKfz', '251', 'not', 'work', 'Czech', 'made', 'OT-10', 'copy', 'SdKfz', '251', 'was', 'assigned', 'front', 'line', 'Warsaw', 'pact', 'units.What', 'weird', 'DVD', 'get', 'see', 'one', 'episode', 'other', 'obvious', 'are', 'using', 'same', 'village', 'set', 'one', 'show', 'other', 'Conversely', 'black', 'white', 'works', 'fine', 'Why', 'Most', 'Army', 'combat', 'footage', 'WWII', 'was', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'can', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'various', 'combat', 'episodes', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'used', 'film', 'showing', 'German', 'Wespe', 'plastering', 'heck', 'American', 'positions', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool.Combat', ""n't"", 'bad', 'show', 'just', 'time', 'passed', 'bought', 'disks', 'discount', 'would', 'never', 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'series.I', 'gave', 'show', 'four', 'stars', 'One', 'third', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'One', 'third', 'are', 'bad', 'One', 'third', 'are', 'fair', 'producers', 'give', 'four', 'disks', 'can', 'play', 'episodes', 'once', 'disk', 'can', 'check', 'episodes', 'out', 'separately', 'did', 'later', 'quite', 'bit.But', 'Combat', 'now', 'old', 'enjoyable', 'However', 'would', 'never', 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'production', 'knock', 'down', 'full', 'star', 'bad', 'episodes', 'drag', 'down', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'get', 'lot', 'shows', 'set.Four', 'stars']",N/A

It's remarkable that it has taken this long for the shows to be made available in DVD, and the offering is quite welcome.One small slice of trivia that should interest Baby Boomers and new viewers alike.  *Combat!* was actually used as a sort of half-fast training aid by US Marine Corps NCOs during operations in the city of Hue during the 1968 Tet Offensive.  At that time, the USMC had no formal training in military operations on urbanized terrain (MOUT), and most of the young riflemen deployed to re-take the city had only an imperfect idea of how to go about the sort of house-to-house fighting required.The older NCOs tried to explain the principles involved in moving through streets under fire, but got nowhere until a couple of them remembered the popular television series.  ""You guys all watched *Combat!* right?  Okay, you do it like you saw it on TV.""Combining this very basic universal understanding of fighting in built-up areas with M-48 tanks and M-50 Ontos in support (and a whole lot of C-4), the Marines cleared the NVA out of Hue, killing more than 5,100 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong while laying the foundation for the modern MOUT war fighting doctine in use today....",4,Vietnam era deja vu,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,1399,"['Together', '*The', 'Gallant', 'Men*', 'following', 'small', 'unit', 'American', 'soldiers', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Italy', 'rival', 'network', '*Combat', '*', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'widely', 'watched', 'television', 'shows', 'history', 'remarkable', 'taken', 'long', 'shows', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'offering', 'quite', 'welcome.One', 'small', 'slice', 'trivia', 'should', 'interest', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'new', 'viewers', 'alike', '*Combat', '*', 'was', 'actually', 'used', 'sort', 'half-fast', 'training', 'aid', 'US', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'NCOs', 'operations', 'city', 'Hue', '1968', 'Tet', 'Offensive', 'time', 'USMC', 'had', 'formal', 'training', 'military', 'operations', 'urbanized', 'terrain', 'MOUT', 'most', 'young', 'riflemen', 'deployed', 're-take', 'city', 'had', 'only', 'imperfect', 'idea', 'how', 'go', 'sort', 'house-to-house', 'fighting', 'required.The', 'older', 'NCOs', 'tried', 'explain', 'principles', 'involved', 'moving', 'streets', 'fire', 'got', 'nowhere', 'couple', 'remembered', 'popular', 'television', 'series', 'guys', 'watched', '*Combat', '*', 'right', 'Okay', 'do', 'saw', 'TV', 'Combining', 'very', 'basic', 'universal', 'understanding', 'fighting', 'built-up', 'areas', 'M-48', 'tanks', 'M-50', 'Ontos', 'support', 'whole', 'lot', 'C-4', 'Marines', 'cleared', 'NVA', 'Hue', 'killing', 'more', '5,100', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'laying', 'foundation', 'modern', 'MOUT', 'war', 'fighting', 'doctine', 'use', 'today']",N/A

We don't really get to know the soldiers in the squad because Producer Robert Altman wanted a more anthology-like feel to the program  than it had later, after he left.  The episodes I liked best were those that dealt with realistic situations, especially like those of a new man trying to be accepted by the battle-hardened veterans, and there are a few like that in this set.  There is also a good, nail-biting episode about a British bomb-defuser.  There were also numerous episodes that were simply not realistic and were either played for comedy (one where Shecky Greene's Pvt. Braddock character is mistaken for a Colonel when he is captured by the Germans), or simple action/adventure like the one where Lt. Hanley is sent on a daring mission with a commando (J D Cannon) to rescue a scientist from inside Occcupied France, or another where he is captured by a German General (Albert Paulsen) who uses him to escape the Gestapo who are trying to arrest him for being involved in the Bomb Plot that tried to kill Hitler.  As a special bonus also get to see Ted Knight (in his pre-""Ted Baxter"" days) play a minor role as a German officer whose comedic talents are already seen as he is trying to listen to his commanding officer and hold an unruly cat at the same time.Still, in spite of the uneven quality of the different stories, a clear message comes through most of the episodes, that is we repeatedly see the dedication of men who felt they had to carry out their mission, even at the cost of their lives, yet these were not ""supermen""-just ordinary fellows put into extraordinary situations.

829075,A1Z4VB9DA01AXP,B0002A2W2C,"Gregory Canellis ""Student of military history...","[76, 79]","If you were a kid growing up in the 1960s (as I was), and you didn't watch the TV series Combat! (1962-1967), you were living under a rock. I cannot imagine my neighborhood friends amassing our arsenal of toy guns, plastic helmets, and other uniquely devised accoutrements of war to play Army, without first arguing over who was going to play Sergeant Saunders, ""Cage,"" or the BAR toting, wise-cracking Kirby. After years of sporadic syndication, the release of the entire first season of Combat! on DVD is long overdue.The first season is broken down into two, four-disc packages of 16 episodes each titled: Combat! Season I, Campaign I, and Combat! Season I, Campaign II respectively. The episodes are arranged in the order they aired in syndication, not as originally televised. There are 4 episodes per disc, plus Special Features including photo galleries, and interviews with past cast members. The sound quality is good, and the scenes not overly dark like some black and white transfers to DVD. Absent, however, is a booklet that would have been a nice touch. Instead, a mere list of episodes with scene selections is included. Consequently, I highly recommend the book ""Combat!: A Viewer's Companion to the WWII TV Series (revised)"" by Jo Davidsmeyer as an indispensable guide to the entire five-year run of the series.Campaign I opens with the pilot ""A Day in June,"" which finds the squad of the 2nd platoon of (K)ing Company in England preparing for the D-Day invasion. Interestingly, Hanley (Rick Jason) is a First Sergeant, having not yet received his battlefield commission to lieutenant. Pierre Jalbert, a film editor, not an actor by trade, who will later mold the character of ""Cage,"" is casted here as ""Caddy."" Other regular character-roles such as Lil' John (Dick Peabody) and ""Doc"" (Conland Carter- debuting in season-two) will be introduced in subsequent episodes, but not before Peabody and Carter are cast in different minor roles for an episode each. The comedian Shecky Green was also cast as a regular, but, due to other obligations, would not last the first season. A host of guest stars including: Dean Stockwell, Robert Culp, Frank Gorshin, and Tab Hunter get the first season off to a good start.  Davidsmeyer's book not only lists the episodes as they are in syndication, but also notes what order they were aired. This allows one to watch them in their original order and marvel at the development of the characters of Saunders (Vic Morrow), Hanley and the rest of the squad. Morrow and Jason, both met tragic ends. Morrow was killed on the set of the 1982 film  Twilight Zone: The Movie, and Jason sadly took his own life recently. Watching these first-season episodes today, some of the lessor attention to realism and detail become apparent. For example: the German soldiers are paper-doll cut-outs of each other. From kettle-helmet to jack boots (the latter was all but gone by 1944 anyway), they all wear the exact same uniform and arrange their battle kits the exact same way. At least once during a fire fight, the German will predictably leave cover, foolishly run out into the open, only to be shot by a member of the cast. Following episodes has the standard American M-5 Half-track switching roles between belligerents with the help of a noticeable vehicular make-up change. For other picky viewers, like myself, there is also more chronological attention paid to actual historic events and places during the Normandy Campaign in season one. This historic detail gets lost in subsequent seasons. But it is the fine acting, script-writing, directorial and production talents that made Combat! a classic TV series. The series portrays best the inner conflicts that affects men trying to survive the horrors of war. For the true Combat! fan, this two-part first season is a must have. For those who like the war film genre, or vintage television series with great acting and production, this DVD package will not disappoint.

You need to watch more then 2 episodes, when over 150 were produced, to do a fair evaluation of the series.What made this series stand out that they were able top bring the character of the average fighting man to the small screen.  This was pointed out to me by my dad who was in the European Theater as a front line soldier and others I have talked to that were also there verify the realism.  The stories are well-written and do not glorify war.The cast was also superb with Vic Morrow as Sgt. Saunders, Rick Jason as Lt. Hanley and Pierre Jalbert, Dick Peabody and Jack Hogan being the squad mainstays over the years.The Gallent Men was also a good WWII series but only lasted one year.  I think it was because it failed to have a strong chracter for viewers to identify with like Saunders and because of the little things, such as, my dad noticed on The Gallant Men that when they took their helmets off their hair was perfectly combed.  When Saunders takes his off it looks tangled and messed.If you don't like this series, fine, but cutting it down as being typical super-American soldiers/yak yak yak/ is way off beam.

829077,A276M3NSIY9B82,B0002A2W2C,Harry Brewer,"[2, 2]","One of the sixties great series has been released on DVD! Image Entertainment is responsible, not ABC or Disney though the half season sets would make you think they were the ones responsible. The episodes aren't in chronological order though, which is a shame. Season one of Combat! is a bit disjointed because of the differences in the visions of two directors & the producers. The two directors, Robert Altman (directed 10 episodes) & Burt Kennedy (directed 6 episodes), envisioned the episodes as being focused on individual members of the squad whereas the producers wanted to focus more on the squad as a group. Of course, we know which faction won out which cost the series two great directors.The cast was in a constant flux also. Vic Morrow (Sgt. Saunders) & Rick Jason (Lt. Hanley) were constants. Season one had a little more focus on Hanley than in subsequent seasons. It was the supporting cast that had less stability & yet gave them more opportunity to be the main focus in an episode. Shecky Greene (Pvt. Braddock) was a comedian of some renown in 1962. He was only in 8 episodes total & was the major focus of two episodes. He managed to opt out of his contract before the completion of the first season. In those days ABC has less money to spend that its competitors so they weren't able to pay as much in salary. Greene claimed it cost him money every time he had to do an episode.We barely see Jack Hogan (Pvt. Kirby) or Dick Peabody (Pvt. Littlejohn). Pierre Jalbert (Caje) is a little more visible. His French speaking skills were what kept him in the series. His character background was he was a Cajun from south Louisiana. In reality he was French-Canadian. He was actually a film editor that got hired as a member of the squad because of his French speaking ability, also his English wasn't heavily accented. Fletcher Fist (Pvt. Brockmeyer) figured heavily in the first season because he spoke German fluently.The set opens with the episode ""A Day in June"" which is a flashback to June 6, 1944. We see Hanley was just a sergeant who would later receive a battle field commission. It's a good selection to be shown as first episode though it wasn't originally that way. Combat! would get more focused in season two & become the series that most of us are familiar with. It's fun to see the differences of season one though.There are bonus features that include audio-only commentaries during selected episodes; notes, oddities & bloopers are revealed in notes for most episodes; a photo gallery & a documentary, ""Memories of Combat!"" that has some cast members, guest stars & directors.",4,"Combat - Season 1, Campaign 1",1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,2611,"['One', 'sixties', 'great', 'series', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'responsible', 'not', 'ABC', 'Disney', 'half', 'season', 'sets', 'would', 'make', 'think', 'were', 'ones', 'responsible', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'chronological', 'order', 'shame', 'Season', 'one', 'Combat', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'differences', 'visions', 'two', 'directors', 'producers', 'two', 'directors', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'directed', '10', 'episodes', 'Burt', 'Kennedy', 'directed', '6', 'episodes', 'envisioned', 'episodes', 'being', 'focused', 'individual', 'members', 'squad', 'producers', 'wanted', 'focus', 'more', 'squad', 'group', 'course', 'know', 'faction', 'won', 'out', 'cost', 'series', 'two', 'great', 'directors.The', 'cast', 'was', 'constant', 'flux', 'also', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'Sgt', 'Saunders', 'Rick', 'Jason', 'Lt.', 'Hanley', 'were', 'constants', 'Season', 'one', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'focus', 'Hanley', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'was', 'supporting', 'cast', 'had', 'less', 'stability', 'yet', 'gave', 'more', 'opportunity', 'be', 'main', 'focus', 'episode', 'Shecky', 'Greene', 'Pvt', 'Braddock', 'was', 'comedian', 'renown', '1962', 'was', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'total', 'was', 'major', 'focus', 'two', 'episodes', 'managed', 'opt', 'contract', 'completion', 'first', 'season', 'days', 'ABC', 'less', 'money', 'spend', 'competitors', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'pay', 'as', 'much', 'salary', 'Greene', 'claimed', 'cost', 'money', 'time', 'had', 'do', 'episode.We', 'barely', 'see', 'Jack', 'Hogan', 'Pvt', 'Kirby', 'Dick', 'Peabody', 'Pvt', 'Littlejohn', 'Pierre', 'Jalbert', 'Caje', 'little', 'more', 'visible', 'French', 'speaking', 'skills', 'were', 'what', 'kept', 'series', 'character', 'background', 'was', 'was', 'Cajun', 'south', 'Louisiana', 'reality', 'was', 'French-Canadian', 'was', 'actually', 'film', 'editor', 'got', 'hired', 'member', 'squad', 'French', 'speaking', 'ability', 'also', 'English', 'was', ""n't"", 'heavily', 'accented', 'Fletcher', 'Fist', 'Pvt', 'Brockmeyer', 'figured', 'heavily', 'first', 'season', 'spoke', 'German', 'fluently.The', 'set', 'episode', 'Day', 'June', 'flashback', 'June', '6', '1944', 'see', 'Hanley', 'was', 'just', 'sergeant', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'receive', 'battle', 'field', 'commission', 'good', 'selection', 'be', 'shown', 'first', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'originally', 'way', 'Combat', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'focused', 'season', 'two', 'become', 'series', 'most', 'are', 'familiar', 'fun', 'see', 'differences', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'audio-only', 'commentaries', 'selected', 'episodes', 'notes', 'oddities', 'bloopers', 'are', 'revealed', 'notes', 'most', 'episodes', 'photo', 'gallery', 'documentary', 'Memories', 'Combat', 'cast', 'members', 'guest', 'stars', 'directors']",N/A

This show, albeit old, captures many of the current threats our men and woman face.  I think it was chintzy of the distributors to release the series in two parts.

episodes...In fact, if I could give this first  season 3 1/2 stars I would....the show was trying to find its' bearings in this first season, and would face many bumps as directors and writers came and went....these are valuable episodes though in setting up what will become the best television series which covered the WWII theater....Some of the Highlights:Lost Sheep Lost Shepherd....Jeffery Hunter is the guest star as a priest who fell from grace and is now a tanker...when he blows up the church steeple, you cannot help but think of his role in King of Kings.Forgotten Front...guest star Albert Paulsen (who recently passed away) portrays a very sympathetic German who is captured by Saunders...the writers had to add the final scene between Caje and Saunders because the producers did not like the final outcome of Paulsen's character...Cat and Mouse...a very exciting and tense story with Albert Salmi as a Seargent equal to Saunders in grit and determination.Reunion....what does one do, when you find out your long lost father is a collaborator for the Germans?The Medal....Frank Gorshin reluctantly, then aggressively, takes credit for a heroic act that he didn't do...No Time for Pity....one of the many episodes which shows the war's effect on children....The Sniper....German sniper picks off US soldiers in French town.No Trumpets No Drums...Caje suffers through a period of angst after killing a little girl's father....These epsisodes, and others are the high points of the first season...but since the characters have not yet fully evolved, there are some episodes that they are secondary to, at times, rather mundane characters:Any Second Now....Hanley is caught under some rubble in a church with an unexploded bomb for company...a rather boring subplot between the British demo man and his love interest...Missing in Action....Howard Duff as a downed pilot is again center stage to a romantic plot lineThe Chateau...Doc #1 is given the star treatment in this episode..the problem is that he is not a very good actorThe Prisoner....Shecky Greene's comedic talents are on display but the episode is too ""Hogans Heroes-ish"" to be any good...The Walking Wounded...this time we have too much Gary Merrill..Off Limits....William Windom and Peggy Ann Garner are lovers and guess what?...Garner is married to one of Saunders men!...yawnWell, I could go on but I will spare you....as I said, for the first season, there are highs and lows, but they do set up what is to come, and if you have some patience, there are many rewards in this first season....So by all means, pick up this first season because the price is right and there is much to enjoy....as the seasons progressed, the show just got better, culminating in the 2 part masterpiece, ""Hills are

829080,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B0002A2W2C,Kevin R. Austra,"[18, 18]","COMBAT! is from the era of great television.  How else could you explain the popularity of the show over its five year run?  Much like M*A*S*H, which stretched the Korean War to more than a decade, COMBAT! sustained 1944 for several years.  After its run on ABC, COMBAT! went immediately into syndication and has run continuously, on one station or another, since 1967.  The challenge for many fans however, has been to find a consistent source for the program.  For viewers, such as me, it was always a case where COMBAT! premiered on a cable or satellite network other than those available in my area.In the mid 1980s, Goodtimes Video released five episodes of COMBAT!  Whether Goodtimes was testing the market or just issuing random releases, the videos -- recorded in Long Play mode -- soon found their way into bargain bins.  Though there was talk for years of releasing whole box sets of the series it never happened.Pardon me for saying so, but COMBAT! was produced at a time when television actors actually had to work for a living.  The cast was underpaid, held to incredible production deadlines, worked all hours at a variety of locations under a meager budget.  Remember too that television series of that decade ran much longer without reruns than do the skimpy shows today.  In the case of COMBAT!'s first season (Campaigns 1 & 2), that totals 32 episodes.Akin to the cast of BAND OF BROTHERS, the recurring actors on COMBAT! endured a stint of accelerated Army basic training at Fort Ord, California.  In fact, the Department of the Army provided considerable assistance in the series' production.You can easily find fault with the series.  Not unlike westerns of the day, sets are recognizably used again and again.  Occasionally a palm tree sneaks into what should otherwise be Northern France.  The German soldiers are often dressed more like the German Army in 1935 than camouflaged Wehrmacht of 1944.  Fair enough.  COMBAT! is not quite history.  If you are looking for reality, rewatch SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.COMBAT! is a quality television series that was able to produce 50-minute shows complete with superb storylines, directing, and acting.

I wanted to be just like Sergeant Saunders (Vic Morrow) and when the kids in the neighborhood played ""Army,"" I was always his character with my trusty Thompson in hand (I still have a thing about those Thompson guns-but that's another story).Now, after all these years, I can relive some of that old excitement. I just finished watching this first set and I cannot believe how good my taste was even as a kid.  Then I liked the action and adventure.  Now, well I still like that stuff, but I am even more impressed by the characters, the writing and the whole craft of the production.  I cannot believe how good this series really was.  Big name actors clamored to be guests, big name directors, such as Robert Altman, were involved.  This is good television, even after 40 something years.What makes these stories work is that they are some much more than action and adventure. They are really little morality plays, where each man or woman wrestles with their humanity and moral choices in the face of the crisis of war.I even appreciated the much slower pace of the episodes.  There was time, in those days, to work on things like plot, character development and the craft of storytelling. The characters and multileveled, they develop as the series progresses, and they have, for the most part, great writing with which to work.  This beats almost anything on television today.

We used to call our mom the Sarge (she was the disciplinarian in the house).The episodes were good to excellent with Survival being the best one in my opinion.  The revolving cast was interesting.

At one of the episodes at the end of season one, Morrows jacket from the wrist to the elbows is completely shot from all the crawling around and you got the sense that they were always dirty unlike some other shows.There were mistakes in accuracy of the vehicles and some of the uniforms but overall the feel was that of a combat unit.It was also nice seeing actors at the beginning of their careers being guest stars.I enjoyed this and will buy the series as it comes out.

My question is: Why did Image Entertainment allow this to happen? They didn't do this with I SPY, NAKED CITY, or DICK VAN DYKE. I understand that Image is just a distributor, but they should have DEMANDED that the masters used for these dvd sets be UNEDITED. ""Time Compressed"" is when they digitally edit out several minutes of a program so that they have more time for commercials. What's left after the editing is then digitally ""compressed"" together. These episodes should run approximately 50 minutes, but on these edited dvd's they run about 46 minutes. That means there's over 50 minutes of missing footage in this set!! In the old days, the rule was 5 minutes of commercials for every half-hour of programming (25 min. of show + 5 min. of commercials). Tell-tale signs of a time compressed show are:The action moves a little faster (moving vehicles will sometimes skip instead of rolling smoothly)The actors voices are higher pitchedThe music is ""choppy"" (try singing while lightly karate chopping your throat--this is what it sounds like to me)To me, a time compressed show is very annoying. I also feel like i'm being cheated because i'm not getting the COMPLETE versions of these episodes. I would highly advise you to rent these discs before you buy them. I'm certainly glad i did.

Telly Savalas, Frankie Avalon, Leonard Nimoy, Mickey Rooney, Eddie Albert, Charles Bronson, are just a few of the big names that show up...,whether as German soldiers or American soldiers or civilians caught somewhere in between. There is an amazing variety of talent on display, not to mention the great talents of Vic Morrow and Rick Jason as regular stars. I was surprised, for example, at how good a performance Frankie Avalon gave as a brash wise-cracking young soldier thinking the war was going to be a breeze, until he was captured by a German patrol. Or Mickey Rooney as a supply sergeant lugging a huge set of silverware through a blizzard with Germans chasing him, refusing to let it go because the silverware was for his mother. Or Eddie Albert as a shell-shocked World War One soldier who thinks it's still 1918. Or Telly Savalas as the commander of an independent unit of Greek soldiers staging raids on a German supply depot. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of the great talent on display.  Charles Bronson, for example, has a great quirky guest role in one episode as a trainer of pigeons that carry mini cameras for special reconnaissance. Lee Marvin makes an appearance in an episode as a bitter exhausted overworked demolition expert on a mission to blow up a bridge. This series is great for so many reasons, the superb writing, the world-class acting and talent, the best directors in the business, it well worth having and watching. I assure you that you could watch these episodes over and over and not get tired of them. The entire series is excellent.  The disks worked very well, and there are great extra features such as commentary from directors and the film crew and notes on each episode about things that happened or bloopers that occurred during filming.

My friends and I were in 2nd grade when it premiered, and we'd play army afterwards, based on the story and our own imagination of course.

Many of the story themes are much more sophisticated than I remember, and more complex than you would associate with TV in the year 1962 and shortly thereafter. Recall that there were hundreds of thousands of men, still in their 30's, who had actually lived through all of that, when this show was on.

829090,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B0002A2W2C,Robert Huggins,"[13, 13]","Despite the fact that Combat! has been run on cable stations and syndicated to select broadcast markets, I had not seen the series since it ended its original run on ABC in 1967.  Viewing these DVDs today, I'm struck by just how good these episodes hold up after all these years.  There are several reasons for this . . . excellent writing, acting and production values.  Yes, the battle scenes are generally well done, but it's the human drama of men (and women) in wartime situations that make this an outstanding and memorable series.  And, I like the fact that the Germans and French speak in their native languages without subtitles.  The audience is placed in the same situation as most of the GIs . . . unable to understand a foreign language save for a German translator now and then, or through ""Caje,"" the French speaking Cajun from Louisiana.I bought this first collection of Combat! episodes after Season 1, Campaign 2 and there are some differences.  In terms of the cast, the Campaign 1 DVDs include the only episodes where you'll see Shecky Greene's Private Braddock.  Greene departed the show early on and was replaced by the better known character Private Kirby, portrayed by Jack Hogan, who is in a few episodes on this collection.  Greene makes the most of his comedic talents in ""The Prisoner,"" an atypical episode for the series which also stars Keenan Wynn as Colonel Clyde, a role that foreshadowed his memorable role as Colonel ""Bat"" Guano in Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove.""  This first group of episodes has the bulk of director Robert Altman's Combat! output and he even contributes a commentary, though there are long pauses between his comments, unlike the other two commentaries provided by actor Tom Lowell (""Billy Nelson"") and assistant director Michael Caffey (Altman contributes a second commentary on Campaign 2).  Like Greene, Altman would also leave the show before the conclusion of Season 1.  The ""Memories of Combat!"" documentary is a worthwhile addition to the 16 episodes included in this set and it's fairly remarkable that the producers of the DVD were able to round up a number of the surviving cast and crew members for a show that began broadcasts in 1962.  Most of the individuals in the documentary also provide commentaries for selected episodes in Campaigns 1 and 2.  Finally, there is a gallery of ""behind-the-scenes"" production photos and author Jo Davidsmeyer's notes for each episode.  You'll get twice the number of commentaries on Campaign 2, but no documentary or photo gallery.  So if you want to buy just one of the two sets, Campaign 1 might be the better choice, especially for the Season 1 documentary, which is a must for fans of the series.As far as the quality of the DVDs is concerned, the mono audio is clear and the visuals are mostly very good for a show that's over 40 years old.  The DVDs do utilize prints that are time compressed but, frankly, I couldn't see or hear much of a difference.

It had gripping stories, intriguing characters, & plenty of moral angst for the viewer to mull over. It takes place in 1944 France in the period after the D-Day landings, but before the battle of the Bulge. Vic Morrow's {Sergeant Saunders}brooding style was perfect & essential for this series. He was the unsung star that made everything click. Usually, an episode had a five minute prologue showing the difficulties of the troops pressing forward during a vile artillery barrage, or extreme weather conditions. Then a dilemma hits one of the characters. Often with mature & thorny issues are addressed over the 48 minutes. Ex: ""Should they shoot their prisoner, or bring him along? As the series advances, the characters grow more comfortable with themselves & each other. Tw of the earliest episodes stand out for me. Number 5 ""Lost Sheep, Lost Shepard,"" guest star Jeffrey Hunter plays a tormented tank crewman Sgt. Dane who had been a defrocked Priest in his civilian life. In the town of Gavray the German's are holding the citizens prisoner in a church, while the GI's wonder where they are. This episode  showed true angst for the man seeking redemption. This may have been the most complex episode in a very rich first season? In episode six ""Forgotten Front,"" the excellent character actor Albert Paulsen plays the part of a ""very human enemy."" This is one of those rare occasions where a German is portrayed in a way that even his enemies can empathize with. Lastly, director Robert Altman stated that working on ""Combat"" was the height of his career.

The picture quality of the few episodes I've seen thus far is excellent.  The speed of the episodes seems just a tad fast, which means they probably worked from prints that are time compressed for TV broadcast.  As such, some of the voices sound just a shade high at times.  But it's not worth getting excited about.  The episodes are complete so all is well.  The extras are superb, and this is a show in which extras certainly are warranted.  The packaging of the DVDs is excellent as well, with the cases resembling, what else(?), a foot locker.  And then there's the greatness of the show itself.  Put simply, this is as good a dramatic show as I've ever seen on TV.  Almost all the actors on this show were superb, but Vic Morrow's work continues to amaze.  Man, could TV use a talent like his today.And you'll want the remaining 4 seasons when they come out.  The show got even better as it progressed.  There were five seasons in total, the last one being in color.  Though when it switched to color in season 5, in my opinion, some of the gritiness of the show was lost.
