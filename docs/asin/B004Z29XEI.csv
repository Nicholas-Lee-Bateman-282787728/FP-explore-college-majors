1434159,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B004Z29XEI,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 1]","Like Crazy starring Alton Yelchin and Felicity Jones is one of those kind of films that you think aren't going to leave a big impression on you, and then you end up thinking about this film for days and days! Like Crazy is romantic drama set around Jacob and Anna, he's American and she's British. They meet and fall in love in San Diego and then she has to go back to the UK. When they finally meet up again, her student Visa has expired and she is not allowed in to the United States until she can get her Visa renewed again. Jacob and Anna's relationship is deeply complicated and yet confusing at times. The film jumps around too much and the viewer is left scratching its head in confusion. It's not a perfect movie but I feel like it's accurate of how relationships go through ups and downs, espcially long-distance relationships. What makes this film worth watching is newcomer, Felicity Jones. Her eyes are so expressive and you truly feel every emotion she is feeling, good or bad. Like Crazy is beautifully shot and wonderfully acted (and the ending is so real that it hurts) so give it a try.

1434161,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004Z29XEI,A kids review,"[1, 2]","Looking for a little romance to fill your Friday night with the significant other? If you don't mind them in the bittersweet variety, Like Crazy may be right up your alley. After two little-seen films, director Drake Doremus achieved some significant buzz for this third feature, which took home the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2011. Based loosely on Doremus's real life experiences, the film stars Anton Yelchin as American college student Jacob and Felicity Jones as Anna, the British exchange student he falls in love with. After a passionate summer together, Anna overstays her student visa but returns to London; when she attempts to return to Jacob, she is denied reentry into the States, and a difficult long-distance relationship ensues. While Like Crazy sports a lot of the elements one would expect to find in a romance, the film succeeds in portraying real characters and genuine emotion, crafting a true, intimate study. It's not your average happy-go-lucky movie, but if you relish the ups and downs of rapturous joy and deeply felt heartache, this could be the movie for you.",3,Like Crazy,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1093,"['Looking', 'little', 'romance', 'fill', 'Friday', 'night', 'significant', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bittersweet', 'variety', 'Crazy', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'two', 'little-seen', 'films', 'director', 'Drake', 'Doremus', 'achieved', 'significant', 'buzz', 'third', 'feature', 'took', 'home', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Sundance', '2011', 'Based', 'loosely', 'Doremus', 'real', 'life', 'experiences', 'film', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'American', 'college', 'student', 'Jacob', 'Felicity', 'Jones', 'Anna', 'British', 'exchange', 'student', 'love', 'passionate', 'summer', 'together', 'Anna', 'student', 'visa', 'returns', 'London', 'when', 'return', 'Jacob', 'denied', 'reentry', 'States', 'difficult', 'long-distance', 'relationship', 'ensues', 'Crazy', 'sports', 'lot', 'elements', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'romance', 'film', 'portraying', 'real', 'characters', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'crafting', 'true', 'intimate', 'study', 'not', 'average', 'happy-go-lucky', 'movie', 'relish', 'ups', 'downs', 'rapturous', 'joy', 'deeply', 'felt', 'heartache', 'could', 'be', 'movie']",Like Crazy

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 3]","Anna, an attractive British student spending a year in California, meets fellow student Jacob and they fall in love. They seem perfectly suited - but their love undergoes an unexpected test in this fairly dour but tough-minded little flick. Anna can't bear to leave Jacob at the end of the semester and overstays her visas so they can ""spend the summer in bed."" That decision determines their fate.Anna eventually returns to London but the two pine for each other. When she travels back to California to be reunited, she's stopped at passport control and sent back to London. American bureaucracy, so impersonal, will now prevent her return to the United States.Anna and Jacob both begin to build careers, he hand-making furniture, she in journalism. They both embark on affairs with others, and yet remain in love. Jacob doesn't seem ready to consider a life in Britain. The only way Anna could gain entry to the United States is by marrying -- so they get married. Surely now, all will end well.What I liked about this movie was its realism and refusal to give in to the tropes of the romantic comedy or the expectations of the audience to deliver the usual ""life affirming"" happy ending. Yes, love is powerful but it is not all-powerful.

1434166,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004Z29XEI,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","When `Like Crazy' was making the Sundance circuit and garnering much deserved attention, many were comparing it to 2010's devastating marital dissection piece, `Blue Valentine'.  It was being heralded as this past years answer to the truth about relationships; a relationship life cycle of sorts.  It was, obviously, much tamer (notably edited to achieve a PG-13 rating instead of the R rating it initially snagged) and it constructed its development differently (where `Blue Valentine' siphons the beginning of their relationship alongside the end of their marriage, `Like Crazy' starts at the beginning and follows it through in chronological order), but at the end of the day it has a very similar effect.This film is so real.I was expecting, in a way, to see a cheap knockoff of one of the best films in recent memory (`Blue Valentine' has only grown in my esteem as one of the first masterpieces of this current decade) but instead I received a special film; an intimate and unique fascinating look at love and the toll it takes on a person.`Like Crazy' tells the story of Jacob and Anna.  Jacob is an LA native, while Anna is from Europe and is in the States with a visa in order to attend college.  That is where they meet and that is where they fall in love.  Sadly, in a hasty lovelorn decision, Anna violates her visa in order to spend the summer with Jacob and winds up being refused entry back into the country once she leaves to attend a wedding.  Forced to spend long spans of time apart, their love for one another (which is undeniable) is put to full test as they venture into other relationships while still trying to keep their own.  The film covers the beginning of their love affair and follows it through a few years as they grow apart and then fall madly back in love when in each other's company.Yelchin and Jones are beautifully in sync throughout the film; building a beautiful repertoire with one another.  It is a stunning chemistry that they have and it allows the viewer to truly invest in the truth of their relationship.  The supporting cast is also good, especially Jennifer Lawrence, who bleeds a natural depletion of love as she pines for Yelchin's affections.`Like Crazy' is nowhere near as devastating as `Blue Valentine', so don't let the comparisons deter you from giving this a try (I'm telling you MKIA, you'll love this).  Instead, `Like Crazy' sheds a slight ounce of hope that these two star-crossed lovers will rekindle something that seems so lost.  I love the ambiguity of some film endings, and the way that this film closes (the beautiful close ups, the contrasted blue backdrop, the tearful memories, the sudden blackness) is just a monumental emotional achievement.  I still prefer `Blue Valentine', by possible leaps and bounds (that film is a masterpiece) but there is no denying that `Like Crazy' also understands the beauty and the devastation of a relationship.",5,The halves that halve you in half...,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2916,"['When', 'Crazy', 'was', 'making', 'Sundance', 'circuit', 'garnering', 'much', 'deserved', 'attention', 'many', 'were', 'comparing', '2010', 'devastating', 'marital', 'dissection', 'piece', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'was', 'being', 'heralded', 'past', 'years', 'answer', 'truth', 'relationships', 'relationship', 'life', 'cycle', 'sorts', 'was', 'obviously', 'much', 'tamer', 'notably', 'edited', 'achieve', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'instead', 'R', 'rating', 'initially', 'snagged', 'constructed', 'development', 'differently', 'where', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'siphons', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'end', 'marriage', 'Crazy', 'starts', 'beginning', 'chronological', 'order', 'end', 'day', 'very', 'similar', 'effect.This', 'film', 'so', 'real.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'way', 'see', 'cheap', 'knockoff', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'only', 'grown', 'esteem', 'one', 'first', 'masterpieces', 'current', 'decade', 'instead', 'received', 'special', 'film', 'intimate', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'look', 'love', 'toll', 'person.', 'Crazy', 'story', 'Jacob', 'Anna', 'Jacob', 'LA', 'native', 'Anna', 'Europe', 'States', 'visa', 'order', 'attend', 'college', 'where', 'meet', 'where', 'fall', 'love', 'Sadly', 'hasty', 'lovelorn', 'decision', 'Anna', 'visa', 'order', 'spend', 'summer', 'Jacob', 'up', 'being', 'refused', 'entry', 'back', 'country', 'attend', 'wedding', 'Forced', 'spend', 'long', 'spans', 'time', 'apart', 'love', 'one', 'undeniable', 'put', 'full', 'test', 'venture', 'other', 'relationships', 'still', 'trying', 'keep', 'own', 'film', 'beginning', 'love', 'affair', 'few', 'years', 'grow', 'apart', 'then', 'fall', 'madly', 'back', 'love', 'when', 'other', 'company.Yelchin', 'Jones', 'are', 'beautifully', 'sync', 'film', 'building', 'beautiful', 'repertoire', 'one', 'stunning', 'chemistry', 'have', 'viewer', 'truly', 'invest', 'truth', 'relationship', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'good', 'especially', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'natural', 'depletion', 'love', 'Yelchin', 'affections.', 'Crazy', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'devastating', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'comparisons', 'deter', 'giving', 'try', ""'m"", 'telling', 'MKIA', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Instead', 'Crazy', 'sheds', 'slight', 'ounce', 'hope', 'two', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'will', 'rekindle', 'something', 'so', 'lost', 'love', 'ambiguity', 'film', 'endings', 'way', 'film', 'beautiful', 'close', 'ups', 'contrasted', 'blue', 'backdrop', 'tearful', 'memories', 'sudden', 'blackness', 'just', 'monumental', 'emotional', 'achievement', 'still', 'prefer', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'possible', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'denying', 'Crazy', 'also', 'beauty', 'devastation', 'relationship']",Like Crazy

1434176,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004Z29XEI,Ed Uyeshima,"[21, 29]","There is a level of genuine intimacy generated by the two actors, Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin (Chekhov in theStar Trekreboot), playing the young lovers in this low-key, low-budget 2011 indie romantic drama directed and co-written by Drake Doremus. Apparently, he and co-scenarist Ben York Jones wrote a fifty-page outline for the movie and allowed the actors to flesh out the story by having them improvise most of their lines. The net result is a level of naturalness achieved in their performances that comes across without contrivance, no small feat given how predictable most love-at-first-sight movies can be. However, there is a nagging conventionality and a relative imbalance to the love story that makes the film fall short of its emotional objective with this viewer.Yelchin and Jones play Jacob and Anna, senior-year college students in LA who fall in love shortly before the latter is to return to her native London. Naturally, there is a meet-cute set-up that leads to a hesitant first date that leads them headlong into unbridled romance. So smitten are they with each other that Anna overstays her student visa and doesn't return home on schedule. When she tries to return to LA, she is detained by immigration officials and forced to go home. What occurs is a long-distance relationship hampered by their separate burgeoning careers (she becomes a magazine writer/blogger, he a furniture designer), the fragility of love, and the fear of commitment. Their hopeless naivet&eacute; in a post-9/11 world is a plot device that forces each of them to decide what they are willing to do to invest in their relationship.It is at this point that each seems to divert since Anna is willing to make all the hard choices whereas Jacob appears comparatively passive in his commitment. Perhaps it would have been excessive (and maybe a bit boring) to have both lovers follow their hearts in equal proportion, but the gap does undermine what would have made the relationship more compelling to witness beyond the standard romantic montages and overtures seen in like-minded films (The Notebook, for example). While both lead actors are affecting and perceptive in their respective roles, the charismatic Jones has the advantage of playing a character that is far more transparent in her motivations. Yelchin is saddled with the more elliptical role where we are left to guess how far he is willing to commit.Compelling in just a few scenes as Jacob's comely assistant Sam, Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) is the inevitable temptation in his path, while Charlie Bewley makes less of an impression as Anna's neighbor Simon. Familiar TV actors Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead play Anna's supportive parents with measured gusto, while another familiar small-screen face, Finola Hughes (""General Hospital""), nicely plays Anna's boss. Framed by John Guleserian's hand-held digital camerawork, the film benefits from the incisive way Doremus staged several of the key scenes, especially the ones that highlight the intermittent disconnects between the lovers, and the young filmmaker shrewdly provides an ambiguous ending allowing viewers to fill in the blanks with the future of Jacob's and Anna's relationship.

The have a refreshing take on the fragile delicacies that surround first love and have presented a story with a solid idea that somehow gradually fizzles as the film turns the corner at the denouement. What begins as a lovely, underplayed examination of how fresh love happens between two young people turns into a somewhat discordant trial of endurance on the part of the couple whose nascent love so beautifully fills the screen at first.American furniture design student Jacob (Anton Yelchin) and British journalism student Anna (Felicity Jones) fall instantly in love when they meet as students at an L.A. university. More is said with silences and the gradual onset of physical behavior with beautifully captured atmospheres that many extraneous words could clutter. But Anna, being British, must return to England at graduation because her student visa expires.  Anna's parents (Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead) visit the couple and are happy with the nascent relationship. But when graduation approaches, Anna decides to stay and violate her student visa rather than returning to England. After a visit home, she is then unable to return to the United States. While fighting customs and immigration battles, Anna and Jacob must decide if their relationship is worth the distance and the hardship.  In the intervening time lapses communication becomes strained, Anna gains a new boyfriend Simon (Charlie Bewley) and Jacob has a live-in flame Samantha (Jennifer Lawrence), but in an attempt to solve immigration problems Jacob flies to England and marries Anna.  From that point the story flounders and the manner in which the tale ends is frustrating not only to the couple but to the audience.Despite a script that looses its way during what seems to be the nidus of a very charming film, the actors in each of the roles do their best to make it work - and for the most part they succeed. The audience is left wondering just how successful the eventual resolution (or lack thereof) of the relationship will be.  Good idea, needed more time in the oven.

Mason ""relyonme""","[3, 3]","Not knowing what to make of all the conflicting comments about this film, I decided to go buy it on my own instincts, and am glad that I did.No, it's not a masterpiece, nor, I daresay, it is meant to be.  Instead, it is a small scale work that deals extremely well with the oldest of storylines known to man - that of falling in love.  In this case, the protagonists are two college kids who get to know each other at the moment they are about to study for a career in Los Angeles, which in more ways than one turns out to be a distance much harder to span than its geographical mileage from London would suggest. Long distance love affairs can no doubt be trying in the best of circumstances, but when you add the U.S. Immigration Dept. into the mix you've got one helluva problem.Still, ""where there's a will there's a way,"" and this film beautifully captures in a completely natural a convincing way the emotional ties between two people that even the U.S. Immigration apparatchiks can't break.  She, Anna, is a Londoner who is obliged by force of circumstances to stay in London once her studies are over, and then make a career, whilst he, Jacob, must do the same in L.A.This is one of those films where you feel you're watching real life unfolding before your eyes, rather than some highly scripted drama.  I read that some or indeed much of the dialogue was improvised, and if this is the case, it has paid off in spades. Whilst Anton Yelchin does a fine job as Jacob, the star role must belong to Felicity Jones, who manages to employ every nuance that seems to come so naturally to her somewhat ambiguous feelings about her relationship with Jacob.I thoroughly disagree with the negative comments made about the ending, which is really the perfect and very life like conclusion to what is the running theme that has motivated Anna all along.An excellent movie which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Every time he started to draw a new plywood chair idea on a napkin, I had to laugh.  Leave the plywood chairs to IKEA and other mass manufacturers.I found some moments in this movie compelling, but for the most part it was agonizing to watch Anna and Jacob torture each other and their other partners with the ebb and flow of living together and living apart.  Jennifer Lawrence does an admirable job portraying Jacob's other very admirable love interest.  Felicity Jones' Anna seems to take the reins much of the time to keep whatever is left of their relationship from fading into the past.  Anton Yelchin's Jacob is a limp, malleable character who goes with the flow probably more than he should.SPOILER ALERT  Ultimately the two have legal rights to live together in the US.  When Anna receives the call from her parents' friend Harry (who has toiled for months to get approval for Anna to be able legally be in the US), Anna takes the call with the heaviness and frustration of knowing or at least questioning whether this is what she really wants for her future. Anna leaves a very rewarding career to move to the US and we see her looking up less than ideal jobs on the Internet. Jacob meanwhile gets to move back to his company/living space.

1434188,AQCD1307TM93R,B004Z29XEI,katarinaism,"[0, 0]","Oh, where to start.  At first this movie had a lot of promise...two young adults, Anna and Jacob, who meet in college (while Anna is on a student visa), trying to make a long-distance relationship work.  It's something I could definitely relate to, having done it for three years with my spouse.  But what this movie really failed to depict was two people who really, truly loved each other.First, the main female character Anna makes a horribly dumb decision by overstaying her student visa because she can't fathom the thought of spending the summer without her boyfriend Jacob.  The cavalier way with which she makes this relatively serious infraction of immigration law is puzzling, but even worse is her expectation that there will not be any consequences.  Nevertheless, after leaving with an expired visa to attend her sister's wedding, she returns to the US and is promptly whisked back to the UK, where the story really begins.You'd expect that these two youngsters would speak to each other, email each other, Skype each other constantly like most other couples in this situation do.  Instead, the two let their relationship fall by the wayside, having only cursory, curt conversations on the phone, lacking the softness they exhibited when they were physically together.  You see the characters going out to bars with their friends, but mostly forgetting each other.  You'd also expect that Anna would be crestfallen and determined to get back to the US, but instead she gets a job at a magazine and there's barely any talk of returning to the US.  On Jacob's part, he gives no serious consideration to possibly moving to the UK, even if temporarily.Both Anna and Jacob find new relationships while ostensibly being involved with each other, and it seems plainly unfair to their respective partners that both Anna and Jacob are clearly preoccupied by whatever sentimentality remains between them.  However, this also brings up the point of the best part of this film, which is clearly Jennifer Lawrence as Sam.  Of all the three couple permutations depicted in this film (Anna and Jacob, Anna and Simon, Jacob and Sam), Yelchin's Jacob and Sam's Lawrence have the most convincing chemistry.  The scene where Sam makes breakfast in bed for Jacob is heartwarming, and probably the most authentic few minutes of this film. Perhaps this is because of Lawrence's formidable acting chops, but her playful and assertive, yet forgiving Sam seems a much worthier companion for Jacob than the moody Anna.

1434193,A1KSGE7FCMX6SY,B004Z29XEI,Michelle Sutton,"[0, 0]","I watched this movie on Netflix and it started out great. Then I was hugely disappointed when I found out why ""something felt wrong"" the second time he went to England. Samantha was crazy to stick around. Then poor Simon proposes... ugh, poor guy. I felt bad for him. He had no idea. I didn't like the fact that they never really talked about what they did when they were apart after the first time (except for that one huge argument,) but I did like how it showed that the people they were with were mere substitutes for who they really loved. But after awhile even that gets troubled by the conflict that comes with being disloyal to the commitment they'd made to each other. So the unfaithfulness part of the story was a bummer, but it was different than is usually portrayed because they each knew about other people, just not the full extent of the other person's involvement. Even though some viewers hated the ending, I found it profound because you could see in their eyes the impact that their straying had on both of them. It didn't leave them unaffected. Sheesh, I'd feel bad too if I knew that I had a fill-in lover for a time when I was apart from my true love. So I liked how the realism was shown - that the thing they wanted most (to be together) was tainted by their straying on both ends. I would have been more upset if they had reunited and been super happy like neither of them had done anything to hurt someone else (and living with someone when you really love someone else is not going to make you happy unless you have no conscience.) They both had broken hearts needlessly by allowing someone to love them that they couldn't truly love back. So while the ending was tough to tie up neatly and make a true happy ending, I found it realistic.",4,Watched this last night - sort of a spoiler in this one - but not totally.,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,1766,"['watched', 'movie', 'Netflix', 'started', 'out', 'great', 'Then', 'was', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'why', 'something', 'felt', 'wrong', 'second', 'time', 'went', 'England', 'Samantha', 'was', 'crazy', 'stick', 'around', 'Then', 'poor', 'Simon', 'proposes', 'ugh', 'poor', 'guy', 'felt', 'bad', 'had', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'never', 'really', 'talked', 'what', 'did', 'when', 'were', 'apart', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'huge', 'argument', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'showed', 'people', 'were', 'were', 'mere', 'substitutes', 'who', 'really', 'loved', 'awhile', 'even', 'troubled', 'conflict', 'being', 'disloyal', 'commitment', ""'d"", 'made', 'other', 'unfaithfulness', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'bummer', 'was', 'different', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'knew', 'other', 'people', 'just', 'not', 'full', 'extent', 'other', 'person', 'involvement', 'Even', 'viewers', 'hated', 'ending', 'found', 'profound', 'could', 'see', 'eyes', 'impact', 'straying', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'unaffected', 'Sheesh', ""'d"", 'feel', 'bad', 'too', 'knew', 'had', 'fill-in', 'lover', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'apart', 'true', 'love', 'liked', 'how', 'realism', 'was', 'shown', 'thing', 'wanted', 'most', 'be', 'together', 'was', 'tainted', 'straying', 'ends', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'upset', 'had', 'reunited', 'been', 'super', 'happy', 'had', 'done', 'anything', 'hurt', 'someone', 'else', 'living', 'someone', 'when', 'really', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'happy', 'have', 'conscience', 'had', 'broken', 'hearts', 'needlessly', 'allowing', 'someone', 'love', 'could', ""n't"", 'truly', 'love', 'back', 'So', 'ending', 'was', 'tough', 'tie', 'up', 'neatly', 'make', 'true', 'happy', 'ending', 'found', 'realistic']",Like Crazy
1434194,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004Z29XEI,M. Oleson,"[66, 74]","There have many films over the years about long distance romance including 2010's cute romantic comedy ""Going the Distance.""  In that film it involves one person in New York and the other in L. A.  The characters are put in circumstances that bring a chuckle or two.  That way, the angst of the difficult romance is lessened.  In this film whose title comes from a line ""I love you `like crazy'"" our lovers have more obstacles including distance.  Jacob (Anton Yelchin) is a teaching assistant at a Los Angeles college where Anna (newcomer Felicity Jones) is a student from England.  She has eyes for Jacob and leaves him a rather lengthy note on his car windshield.  We only see glimpses of the note, but Jacob appreciates the effort and the humor of the contents.  They go out and begin dating and eventually fall in love.  During this section of the film we of course get to witness what I refer to as the ""falling in love part"".  That is, running on the beach, eating ice cream, riding bumper cars and so on.  Life is complicated however as Anna has a student visa that will expire so she must return to England for 3 months before returning.  In spite of the potential consequences she decides to stay with Jacob for the summer before returning.  Time quickly passes during this section but upon her return to the U. S. she is denied entry because she had previously overstayed her visa.Anna and Jacob are deeply in love and we can feel their angst.  We are led to believe that both are in love, but clearly Anna has been bitten much harder.  With time passing before they can reunite, Jacob plays house with an assistant at his business (designing and making custom chairs).  As played by Jennifer Lawrence, Sam has also fallen for Jacob.  She is a minor character in the plot but Lawrence makes her sweet, sincere and not some evil monster.  On the other side of the pond, Anna tries to resolve her visa issue but it will take time even after she and Jacob marry on one of his trips to see her.  After he goes back to his business - for some reason he can't relocate - he goes back to Sam and Anna takes up with a neighbor.  Simon (Charlie Bewley) isn't a bad guy either.  He's thoughtful, handsome and clearly a catch.  Still, Jacob and Anna can't shake each other.  But can it ever be the same?Aided by a supple soundtrack, this is a wonderfully drawn film flush with beautiful but believable characters.  Even Anna's parents are to die for.  Felicity Jones will be a star soon.  She has a charm and loveliness that is fresh and welcome.  This is an excellent film for those looking for an honest depiction of young romance.BLU RAY UPDATE (1-7-13) This is the first time I've seen this movie since it was in theaters more than a year ago.  I continue to be amazed at Felicity Jones, who I have seen in subsequent films (""The Tempest"" and ""Albatross"") but nothing better than here.  The chemistry between her and Anton Yelchin as the long distance lovers is what makes this movie special.  Obviously somewhat improvised, especially the physical behavior, you can truly believe this is what falling in love looks and yes, feels like.Pay attention as well to some really nice supporting performances.  Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead as Anna's parents are warm and understanding.  Also, second place lovers played by Jennifer Lawrence and Charlie Bewley have small but effectively emotional roles.  I love the quiet moments, only occasionally filled with the twinkling piano of Dustin O'Halloran.  I also like the way the director Drake Doremus and editor Jonathan Alberts cut the film using unusually sharp transitions to cover long periods of time.  Very effective.This viewing was on Blu ray and I thought it was just as sharp as the theatrical version.  The film clearly has a smallish budget so some of the camera work is done with hand held HD digital equipment, but I thought the transfer looked clear and colorful.  The film comes with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and 1080p resolution.  The audio is in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 but isn't a show stopper as this is a dialog driven film.  Still some of the club scenes and those at the beach and at the airport give the surrounds something to do.  I can understand some audiences being a bit bored with the struggles our lovers face, but I still find it romantically authentic in every way.  Extras include the usual commentaries, some cut scenes and some alternate scenes.",4,BLU RAY UPDATE: 4 1/2 stars for an honest depiction of young romance,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,4430,"['have', 'many', 'films', 'years', 'long', 'distance', 'romance', 'including', '2010', 'cute', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Going', 'Distance', 'film', 'one', 'person', 'New', 'York', 'other', 'L.', 'A', 'characters', 'are', 'put', 'circumstances', 'bring', 'chuckle', 'two', 'way', 'angst', 'difficult', 'romance', 'lessened', 'film', 'title', 'line', 'love', 'crazy', 'lovers', 'have', 'more', 'obstacles', 'including', 'distance', 'Jacob', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'teaching', 'assistant', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'college', 'where', 'Anna', 'newcomer', 'Felicity', 'Jones', 'student', 'England', 'eyes', 'Jacob', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'note', 'car', 'windshield', 'only', 'see', 'glimpses', 'note', 'Jacob', 'effort', 'humor', 'contents', 'go', 'out', 'begin', 'dating', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'section', 'film', 'course', 'get', 'witness', 'what', 'refer', 'falling', 'love', 'part', 'running', 'beach', 'eating', 'ice', 'cream', 'riding', 'bumper', 'cars', 'so', 'Life', 'complicated', 'however', 'Anna', 'student', 'visa', 'will', 'expire', 'must', 'return', 'England', '3', 'months', 'returning', 'spite', 'potential', 'consequences', 'stay', 'Jacob', 'summer', 'returning', 'Time', 'quickly', 'section', 'return', 'U.', 'S.', 'denied', 'entry', 'had', 'previously', 'overstayed', 'visa.Anna', 'Jacob', 'are', 'deeply', 'love', 'can', 'feel', 'angst', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'are', 'love', 'clearly', 'Anna', 'been', 'bitten', 'much', 'harder', 'time', 'passing', 'can', 'reunite', 'Jacob', 'house', 'assistant', 'business', 'designing', 'making', 'custom', 'chairs', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Sam', 'also', 'fallen', 'Jacob', 'minor', 'character', 'plot', 'Lawrence', 'sweet', 'sincere', 'not', 'evil', 'monster', 'other', 'side', 'pond', 'Anna', 'resolve', 'visa', 'issue', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'even', 'Jacob', 'marry', 'one', 'trips', 'see', 'back', 'business', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relocate', 'back', 'Sam', 'Anna', 'up', 'neighbor', 'Simon', 'Charlie', 'Bewley', ""n't"", 'bad', 'guy', 'either', 'thoughtful', 'handsome', 'clearly', 'catch', 'Still', 'Jacob', 'Anna', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'other', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'same', 'Aided', 'supple', 'soundtrack', 'wonderfully', 'drawn', 'film', 'flush', 'beautiful', 'believable', 'characters', 'Even', 'Anna', 'parents', 'are', 'die', 'Felicity', 'Jones', 'will', 'be', 'star', 'soon', 'charm', 'loveliness', 'fresh', 'welcome', 'excellent', 'film', 'looking', 'honest', 'depiction', 'young', 'romance.BLU', 'RAY', 'UPDATE', '1-7-13', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'theaters', 'more', 'year', 'ago', 'continue', 'be', 'amazed', 'Felicity', 'Jones', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'subsequent', 'films', 'Tempest', 'Albatross', 'nothing', 'better', 'here', 'chemistry', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'long', 'distance', 'lovers', 'what', 'movie', 'special', 'Obviously', 'somewhat', 'improvised', 'especially', 'physical', 'behavior', 'can', 'truly', 'believe', 'what', 'falling', 'love', 'looks', 'yes', 'feels', 'like.Pay', 'attention', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'nice', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Alex', 'Kingston', 'Oliver', 'Muirhead', 'Anna', 'parents', 'are', 'warm', 'understanding', 'Also', 'second', 'place', 'lovers', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'Charlie', 'Bewley', 'have', 'small', 'effectively', 'emotional', 'roles', 'love', 'quiet', 'moments', 'only', 'occasionally', 'filled', 'twinkling', 'piano', 'Dustin', ""O'Halloran"", 'also', 'way', 'director', 'Drake', 'Doremus', 'editor', 'Jonathan', 'Alberts', 'cut', 'film', 'using', 'unusually', 'sharp', 'transitions', 'cover', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'Very', 'effective.This', 'viewing', 'was', 'Blu', 'ray', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'sharp', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'clearly', 'smallish', 'budget', 'so', 'camera', 'work', 'done', 'hand', 'held', 'HD', 'digital', 'equipment', 'thought', 'transfer', 'looked', 'clear', 'colorful', 'film', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1080p', 'resolution', 'audio', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', ""n't"", 'show', 'stopper', 'dialog', 'driven', 'film', 'Still', 'club', 'scenes', 'beach', 'airport', 'give', 'surrounds', 'something', 'do', 'can', 'understand', 'audiences', 'being', 'bit', 'bored', 'struggles', 'lovers', 'face', 'still', 'find', 'romantically', 'authentic', 'way', 'Extras', 'include', 'usual', 'commentaries', 'cut', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'scenes']",Like Crazy

Anna is from England attending college is LA.  Jacob is American, who happens to take classes with her at the same university.  Both are young and emotionally available.  Their attraction is instanteneous and over time they build relationship that is consuming all of their emotional energy.  As any young love, there are no rules for this couple; so when Anna breaks the rule by overstaying in US on her student visa, their relationship comes to a test.  Anna is not allowed to enter US until her transgression is cleared with the US Customs department and Jacob will have to choose if he want to coninue visiting her in London or just forgetting about the whole affair.What really touched me is the sincerity of the raw emotions these young people show on the screen.  Longing, heartbreak, need to connect and experience love.  The intensity of feelings that exists only in young love is beautifully captured in this film.  If you have seen ""(500) Days of Summer"", this film will fall into same genre.  Story is original and emotionally packed.

You see, they are both in love, but because their careers are taking off and they are temporarily separated by the English characters screw up regarding her visa, they have to decide which of them is going to sacrifice so that they can be together.  The answer takes an entire hour and a half to figure out.  It is clear that these two are too egotistical and narcissitic to ever experience real love.  The script portarys them as play-acting little brats.  They have no idea what that means.  I would give a marriage between these two about 2-4 years, before they start fooling around with people ""with interests closer to their own,"" or before one of them begins to hate the other for the sacrifices that party made ""for love.""  Hope they don't have any kids.  Without a doubt, these are two of the most repulsive people ever portaryed as star-crossed lovers.  This is low, even for Hollywood.  Why would I want to know what is going on in their heads?  Maybe the director meant this as a horror movie - the attack of the walking dead yuppies.  Nor does the casting add much credibility to the film.  The female lead is reasonably attractive, but the male lead makes quasimodo look like Tom Cruise.  He is disgusting, yet women, including the beautiful Jennifer Lawerence - must have needed the money, hang all over him.  And given his shallow personality, I just can't see the attraction.  The ""aw shucks"" attitude only gets you so far.

And when I saw this film the first time, I don't think I would have given it more than two stars. On impulse, I came back to this film recently and gave it a second, more careful viewing. And this time, I liked what I saw. The acting is high quality. The players give us nuances best appreciated in a second viewing. There are many scenes where gestures and expressions speak louder than words. And this is such a believable story. The idea of a college coed screwing up her immigration status is credible, as is Yeltin's ambition to be a furniture designer. Many Hollywood movies can't even film a barroom scene without making it too good to be true. This film's barroom scenes are completely credible. I liked the makeup touches and camera work used to show the characters changing and getting older. Fine attention to story detail.It all works so well, and yet, the downbeat ending is a complete betrayal of the story arc. In fact, it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment for viewers who have come so far with lovers they've grown attached to. And you talk about needless.

Unlike much of contemporary love stories this film doesn't descend into the physicality of love or love's tensions but takes a page out of traditional or classic romances, focusing on the purity, joy & innocence of first love and how little it takes to ruin that delicate freshness. When the two main characters are tested with a brief separation the lack of patience on the part of one lover, her desire to not let go for even a little while, causes her to jeopardize the relationship all together. The lesson in this romance is that of patience, something most young people lack and a necessary ingredient when protecting the freshness of love's first flush.
