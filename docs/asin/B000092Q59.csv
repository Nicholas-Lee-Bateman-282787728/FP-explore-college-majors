Reading the &quot;Extras&quot; helped a bit but I'm still not sure what to think of it.Almost forty years after the John F. Kennedy assassination, an ex-Marine named Walter Ohlinger comes forward with a startling claim.  He was the shooter on the grassy knoll.  I'm really into conspiracy theories but this one seemed a bit kooky and hard to believe.  The acting by the ex-marine was superb!  It's not a movie I'd rush out to rent again, but I'm glad I did see it.",3,The second shooter?,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,533,"['Honestly', 'think', ""'m"", 'still', 'bit', 'confused', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Reading', 'quot', 'Extras', 'quot', 'helped', 'bit', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'it.Almost', 'forty', 'years', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'ex-Marine', 'named', 'Walter', 'Ohlinger', 'forward', 'startling', 'claim', 'was', 'shooter', 'grassy', 'knoll', ""'m"", 'really', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'one', 'seemed', 'bit', 'kooky', 'hard', 'believe', 'acting', 'ex-marine', 'was', 'superb', 'not', 'movie', ""'d"", 'rush', 'out', 'rent', 'again', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'see']",Interview with the Assassin

He is chilling as a matter-of-fact old man who claims he was the second gunman in the JFK murder and now wants his 15 minutes of fame because he has a fatal illness and is going to die anyway. The maker never lets up once in the shaky camera style of following this dude around as he tries to prove his claim. This isn't a satisfyng film in that you won't necessarily believe this could be. But it does succeed on its own terms as a film that is true to its aims.

751173,A1AP0OUIDWW9A8,B000092Q59,Dr H.Alloy,"[1, 2]","This is a terrific little one gag thriller, the central conceit being that an out of work camerman lives next door to the real assassin who shot JFK and now wants his 15 minutes. This slight idea is milked for maximum effect by director Burger and his cast.Raymond J Barry is the real reason to see this movie. His steely, quitely spoken malevolence makes him one seriously scary and disturbed character-your in no doubt he's capable of taking down a President.Barry's been doing stirling work in supporting roles for years. His other memorable bad guy is in the otherwise woeful 'The Chamber'-he's truly chilling as the unrepentant white supremacist. He also made a strong impression as Robert Duvall's boss in 'Falling Down'.Highly recommended.",3,Chilling Conspiracy Theory Tale is a Winner,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,746,"['terrific', 'little', 'one', 'gag', 'thriller', 'central', 'conceit', 'being', 'out', 'work', 'camerman', 'next', 'door', 'real', 'assassin', 'who', 'shot', 'JFK', 'now', '15', 'minutes', 'slight', 'idea', 'milked', 'maximum', 'effect', 'director', 'Burger', 'cast.Raymond', 'J', 'Barry', 'real', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'steely', 'quitely', 'spoken', 'malevolence', 'one', 'seriously', 'scary', 'disturbed', 'character-your', 'doubt', 'capable', 'taking', 'down', 'President.Barry', 'been', 'doing', 'stirling', 'work', 'supporting', 'roles', 'years', 'other', 'memorable', 'bad', 'guy', 'otherwise', 'woeful', ""Chamber'-he"", 'truly', 'chilling', 'unrepentant', 'white', 'supremacist', 'also', 'made', 'strong', 'impression', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'boss', ""'Falling"", ""Down'.Highly"", 'recommended']",Interview with the Assassin

Annoying hand held camera use and a fake interview that is made into a worthless dvd. This type of junk just clouds the understanding of one of the most tragic events in world history. This dvd exploits the murder and adds nothing of value to the understanding of the event. The directors and producers should hang their heads in shame. Hack work.
