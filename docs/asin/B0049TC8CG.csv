1390224,A21NTQAWUVV82B,B0049TC8CG,"Keita A. Hargis ""Kaxh""","[3, 3]",This series was a show that started out in 2002 I saw it with a few college friends back then and thought it was hilarious. I've finally found it and now watch it with new friends and my siblings. Though it is funny it is not recommended for children/teens under 15...simply because of most of the content.,5,Do you like comedy?,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,306,"['series', 'was', 'show', 'started', 'out', '2002', 'saw', 'few', 'college', 'friends', 'back', 'then', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'found', 'now', 'watch', 'new', 'friends', 'siblings', 'funny', 'not', 'recommended', 'children/teens', '15', 'simply', 'most', 'content']",Excel Saga: Complete Series
1390225,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B0049TC8CG,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Excel a maniac. That works for the secret Across organization. Across wants to rule the world. There's no freakin' way that can happen with henchmen that are as insane and as dumb as Excel is. Her partner, Hyatt, is equally hopeless. She has a weak constitution, or anemia, or cancer, or something. She's always spitting up blood and passing out for no apparent reason. Despite these mental and physical handicaps they do do their best. Each episode has a different story going on inside the main plot, which doesn't unfold until the very end. I honestly didn't enjoy it until about half way through. If you watch Excel Saga try not to have any preconceptions or expectations before you start. Don't take it seriously. Enjoy it for what it is; if you can figure out what it is. It's actually not all that bad.",4,What the heck is going on with this anime?

The series doesn't follow the manga's plot, but instead keeps in the sprirt of said manga and parodies anime in general--a gambit that pays off.

1390228,A20MOP928FGVCE,B0049TC8CG,Mindscrew Delight,"[13, 29]","I am a big fan of parodies and dark humor, so I was really hoping that this would be good. Well, the first time around, I hated it. The non-stop babbling squeak-fest that is Excel's dialogue got on my nerves and was at times, almost intolerable. On top of that, laughs were scarce (except for a few moments about keeping a dog alive as a back-up food supply and a villian named ""That Man""!). Sometime After seeing it all the way through, I discovered the existence of ADV Vid Notes on the DVDs and presto! Everything suddenly made sense and the funniness exemplified.The thing with Excel Saga is that almost all of the humor/parodies in it, can only be picked up with an either an innate understanding of Japanese history/culture, or with these Vid Notes turned on. Trying to laugh without either of these is like driving in the dark with no lights. I cannot stress the importance of this feature enough. The Vid Notes are fascinating, educational and do a good job of clearing up everything so that no joke or parody does un-noticed. But here's the kicker: THE PRECIOUS VID NOTES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BOX SET! You need to buy the individual DVDs or Excel Saga - The Imperfect Collection to get this feature. Thats why I'm giving this 2 stars less than that of Imperfect collection- its that important.This show mostly focuses on the plotless misadventures of the annoying, blabbermouth Excel and Hyatt, the much quieter girl who basically just dies over and over. But there are side stories concerning a man named Pedro who is trying to win his wife's love back, and Excel's apartment neighbors who become civil servants. There are several crappy episodes, though. I find it very hard to enjoy the two Menchi Adventure episodes, all clips that have anything to do with the civil servants (the Power Ranger costumes they wear are the only thing remotely funny about them) and the two recap episodes. This series is plotless, yet there are recap episodes... sure, one of the characters makes a joke about the stupidity of doing this but that don't change the fact that those episodes suck.Basically, this is really only worth getting if you can find DVDs with the Vid Notes and you have an incredible tolerance for floods of rapid-fire squeaky dialogue and bad filler.",1,ADV vid notes or BUST!,1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,2271,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'parodies', 'dark', 'humor', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'Well', 'first', 'time', 'hated', 'non-stop', 'babbling', 'squeak-fest', 'Excel', 'dialogue', 'got', 'nerves', 'was', 'times', 'almost', 'intolerable', 'top', 'were', 'scarce', 'few', 'moments', 'keeping', 'dog', 'alive', 'back-up', 'food', 'supply', 'villian', 'named', 'Man', 'Sometime', 'seeing', 'way', 'discovered', 'existence', 'ADV', 'Vid', 'Notes', 'DVDs', 'presto', 'Everything', 'suddenly', 'made', 'sense', 'funniness', 'exemplified.The', 'thing', 'Excel', 'Saga', 'almost', 'humor/parodies', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'innate', 'understanding', 'Japanese', 'history/culture', 'Vid', 'Notes', 'turned', 'Trying', 'laugh', 'driving', 'dark', 'lights', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'importance', 'feature', 'enough', 'Vid', 'Notes', 'are', 'fascinating', 'educational', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'clearing', 'up', 'everything', 'joke', 'parody', 'un-noticed', 'here', 'kicker', 'PRECIOUS', 'VID', 'NOTES', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'INCLUDED', 'IN', 'THIS', 'BOX', 'SET', 'need', 'buy', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'Excel', 'Saga', 'Imperfect', 'Collection', 'get', 'feature', 'Thats', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', '2', 'stars', 'less', 'Imperfect', 'collection-', 'important.This', 'show', 'mostly', 'plotless', 'misadventures', 'annoying', 'blabbermouth', 'Excel', 'Hyatt', 'much', 'quieter', 'girl', 'who', 'basically', 'just', 'over', 'over', 'are', 'side', 'stories', 'concerning', 'man', 'named', 'Pedro', 'who', 'trying', 'win', 'wife', 'love', 'back', 'Excel', 'apartment', 'neighbors', 'who', 'become', 'civil', 'servants', 'are', 'several', 'crappy', 'episodes', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'two', 'Menchi', 'Adventure', 'clips', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'civil', 'servants', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'are', 'only', 'thing', 'remotely', 'funny', 'two', 'recap', 'episodes', 'series', 'plotless', 'yet', 'are', 'recap', 'episodes', 'sure', 'one', 'characters', 'joke', 'stupidity', 'doing', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'episodes', 'suck.Basically', 'really', 'only', 'worth', 'getting', 'can', 'find', 'DVDs', 'Vid', 'Notes', 'have', 'incredible', 'tolerance', 'floods', 'rapid-fire', 'squeaky', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'filler']",Excel Saga: Complete Series

I cannot review this set as it has not been released at the time of this review.This series bassed on the manga by Rikudou Koshi is in my opinion a classic that all manga/anime fans should own along with the originol manga (at the time of this review their are 22 volumes of the manga).This series follow two teenage girls just out of high school, Excel Excel and Hyatt, who are members of a secreet organization ACROSS (named after a center in fukkuoka in Southern Japan) headed by Lord Ilpallazo (the Ilpalazo is a trendy hotel in Japan) intent on domination. They decide to foucuss their efforts on taking over a city, F-City (I assume refers to Fukuokka) as a step to world domination.It is loaded with parodies of Japanese manga and anime as well as parodies of american movies and comics.It is an extreamly hillarious comdey spanning 26 eppisodes.In my opinion any one who is a fan of manga or anime should own both this anime and the manga. The manga in my opinion is even better and has a different story and more characters, though the anime also has originol characters.",5,GREAT ANIME BASSED ON A GREAT MANGA BY A GREAT MANGAKA,1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,1126,"['review', 'anime', 'whole', 'can', 'not', 'review', 'set', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'time', 'review.This', 'series', 'bassed', 'manga', 'Rikudou', 'Koshi', 'opinion', 'classic', 'manga/anime', 'fans', 'should', 'own', 'along', 'originol', 'manga', 'time', 'review', 'are', '22', 'volumes', 'manga', '.This', 'series', 'follow', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'just', 'high', 'school', 'Excel', 'Excel', 'Hyatt', 'who', 'are', 'members', 'secreet', 'organization', 'ACROSS', 'named', 'center', 'fukkuoka', 'Southern', 'Japan', 'headed', 'Lord', 'Ilpallazo', 'Ilpalazo', 'trendy', 'hotel', 'Japan', 'intent', 'domination', 'decide', 'foucuss', 'efforts', 'taking', 'over', 'city', 'F-City', 'assume', 'refers', 'Fukuokka', 'step', 'world', 'domination.It', 'loaded', 'parodies', 'Japanese', 'manga', 'anime', 'as', 'well', 'parodies', 'american', 'movies', 'comics.It', 'extreamly', 'hillarious', 'comdey', 'spanning', '26', 'eppisodes.In', 'opinion', 'one', 'who', 'fan', 'manga', 'anime', 'should', 'own', 'anime', 'manga', 'manga', 'opinion', 'even', 'better', 'different', 'story', 'more', 'characters', 'anime', 'also', 'originol', 'characters']",Excel Saga: Complete Series
