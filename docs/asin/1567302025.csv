184893,A1JBPRTOJRE2SC,1567302025,anthemic,"[16, 17]","It is a shame that the availability of Ozu films is not more widespread. 'I Was Born But...' exemplifies the concern for family relationships by one of the great masters of Japanese cinema. This film being silent should not  be seen as an obstacle (nor should any silent film). It echoes the charming  pathos and humour one might expect from a Charlie Chaplin classic.The  film tells the story of a family who relocate to suburban Tokyo. The two  sons conflict with the local bullies - one of which is their father's  boss's son. The boys deal with the local bullies only to 'lose face' over  their father acting like a clown. What arises from this becomes a motif for  Ozu - the estranged relationship between children and parents. For Ozu this  is part of everyday life and is somewhat auto-biographical in thought as  his own relationship with his father was also estranged. Further  exemplified, is Ozu's motif of spatial violation and parallel action.Ozu is the anti-thesis of the Hollywood blockbuster and he possesses a  narrow choice of camera positions. Nowhere is the expression &quot;less is  more&quot; more appropriate than here. While there is a rare use of a  tracking shot, Ozu tends to prefer the static camera and usually shoots  from the tatami mat. This sense of mimimalism seems entirely appropriate  given that the film spends much time observing the boys everyday  encounters.This great filmmaker has a knack for expressing the tender  beauty of everyday life and minimal expression. However, the sense of  observation one feels is always pervaded with subtle touches of humour and  emotional resonance -  that it is impossible to become bored with it. I  bless my lucky stars for the offerings that Ozu brought to the world of  filmmaking.",5,One of Ozu's best films,962409600,"07 1, 2000",2000,1763,"['shame', 'availability', 'Ozu', 'films', 'not', 'more', 'widespread', 'Was', 'Born', 'concern', 'family', 'relationships', 'one', 'great', 'masters', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'film', 'being', 'silent', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'obstacle', 'should', 'silent', 'film', 'charming', 'pathos', 'humour', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'classic.The', 'film', 'story', 'family', 'who', 'relocate', 'suburban', 'Tokyo', 'two', 'sons', 'conflict', 'local', 'bullies', 'one', 'father', 'boss', 'son', 'boys', 'deal', 'local', 'bullies', 'only', ""'lose"", 'face', 'father', 'acting', 'clown', 'What', 'motif', 'Ozu', 'estranged', 'relationship', 'children', 'parents', 'Ozu', 'part', 'everyday', 'life', 'somewhat', 'auto-biographical', 'thought', 'own', 'relationship', 'father', 'was', 'also', 'estranged', 'Further', 'exemplified', 'Ozu', 'motif', 'spatial', 'violation', 'parallel', 'action.Ozu', 'anti-thesis', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'narrow', 'choice', 'camera', 'positions', 'expression', 'quot', 'more', 'quot', 'more', 'appropriate', 'here', 'rare', 'use', 'tracking', 'shot', 'Ozu', 'prefer', 'static', 'camera', 'usually', 'shoots', 'tatami', 'mat', 'sense', 'mimimalism', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'given', 'film', 'much', 'time', 'observing', 'boys', 'everyday', 'encounters.This', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'knack', 'expressing', 'tender', 'beauty', 'everyday', 'life', 'minimal', 'expression', 'However', 'sense', 'observation', 'one', 'feels', 'always', 'pervaded', 'subtle', 'touches', 'humour', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'impossible', 'become', 'bored', 'bless', 'lucky', 'stars', 'offerings', 'Ozu', 'brought', 'world', 'filmmaking']",N/A
184894,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,1567302025,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[4, 6]","After receiving high acclaim for his special cinematic style in directing movies of the `40s and `50s, it's about time the world saw some of Yasujiro Ozu's earlier work in the silent medium, and this excellent set of three films from the early 1930s balances the scales nicely.  Best remembered for his realistic portrayals of family life in medium-class Japan, Ozu obviously developed his remarkable insight into human nature and relationships already in the 1920s, as these three family comedies clearly show.  Although very similar to his well-known films of later decades, these silent films have a subtle touch of comedy to spice things up and - in my opinion - make them even more entertaining than his later sound films.  Watching Ozu's films in general feels like stepping into the lives of real people with all their thoughts, feelings and problems as if you are right there among them.  Attention to details, natural acting and a tendency to linger on what seems like mundane daily actions all add to this overall impression of being involved in the film, not just being a distant observer.  This skill was already honed to perfection by the time Ozu directed these three charming family stories in the early 1930s when the rest of the world was embracing sound films, yet Ozu, it seems, wanted to perfect and continue the beautiful and artistic silent film medium for as long as possible.  He directed his first sound film in 1936, beginning a series of more sombre, even somewhat depressing family dramas, making this set of comedies a pleasant and refreshing new look at Ozu's work.  Keeping to the formula he knew best, Ozu's three family comedies include young children, and the focus is on how everyone interacts with one another in the family circle as well as at work and in other surroundings.  ""Tokyo Chorus"" follows the ups and downs in the life of an average working man who becomes unemployed and struggles to keep his wife and children happy, but these real-life problems are tempered with moments of sweet, almost childlike humour, quite different from the often coarse comedy seen in the West.  For me, the most entertaining of the three is ""Passing Fancy"", which focuses on the relationship between a father and son living in poor conditions but helped along by neighbours and friends as the bungling father tries to sort out his life. Children are the stars in the third film, ""I was Born, But..."" where two young brothers learn to deal with moving to a new neighbourhood and the new kids on the block, but fathers once again play a key role in the family interactions.  The natural acting by both adults and children impressed me the most in these films, along with Ozu's apparent easy and casual approach of glimpsing into family life with understanding, compassion and a little bit of wicked humour.  While the picture quality of ""Tokyo Chorus"" is not quite up to the same high standard as the others, it is still enjoyable to watch, especially with the optional piano musical score by Donald Sosin, who does a fine job adding the right ambience to each scene.  The DVDs have their individual slim cases with good notes inside which help shed some more light on this overlooked early part of Ozu's impressive career.  For Ozu and silent film collectors alike, this is a special and unique addition not to be missed!",5,A delightful glimpse into silent Japan,1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,3346,"['receiving', 'high', 'acclaim', 'special', 'cinematic', 'style', 'directing', 'movies', '40s', '50s', 'time', 'world', 'saw', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'earlier', 'work', 'silent', 'medium', 'excellent', 'set', 'three', 'films', 'early', '1930s', 'balances', 'scales', 'nicely', 'Best', 'remembered', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'family', 'life', 'medium-class', 'Japan', 'Ozu', 'obviously', 'developed', 'remarkable', 'insight', 'human', 'nature', 'relationships', 'already', '1920s', 'three', 'family', 'comedies', 'clearly', 'show', 'very', 'similar', 'well-known', 'films', 'later', 'decades', 'silent', 'films', 'have', 'subtle', 'touch', 'comedy', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'opinion', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'entertaining', 'later', 'sound', 'films', 'Watching', 'Ozu', 'films', 'general', 'feels', 'stepping', 'lives', 'real', 'people', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'problems', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'Attention', 'details', 'natural', 'acting', 'tendency', 'linger', 'mundane', 'daily', 'actions', 'add', 'overall', 'impression', 'being', 'involved', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'being', 'distant', 'observer', 'skill', 'was', 'already', 'honed', 'perfection', 'time', 'Ozu', 'directed', 'three', 'charming', 'family', 'stories', 'early', '1930s', 'when', 'rest', 'world', 'was', 'embracing', 'sound', 'films', 'yet', 'Ozu', 'wanted', 'perfect', 'continue', 'beautiful', 'artistic', 'silent', 'film', 'medium', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'directed', 'first', 'sound', 'film', '1936', 'beginning', 'series', 'more', 'sombre', 'even', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'family', 'dramas', 'making', 'set', 'comedies', 'pleasant', 'refreshing', 'new', 'look', 'Ozu', 'work', 'Keeping', 'formula', 'knew', 'best', 'Ozu', 'three', 'family', 'comedies', 'include', 'young', 'children', 'focus', 'how', 'everyone', 'one', 'family', 'circle', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'other', 'surroundings', 'Tokyo', 'Chorus', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'average', 'working', 'man', 'who', 'unemployed', 'keep', 'wife', 'children', 'happy', 'real-life', 'problems', 'are', 'tempered', 'moments', 'sweet', 'almost', 'childlike', 'humour', 'quite', 'different', 'often', 'coarse', 'comedy', 'seen', 'West', 'most', 'entertaining', 'three', 'Passing', 'Fancy', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'living', 'poor', 'conditions', 'helped', 'along', 'neighbours', 'friends', 'bungling', 'father', 'tries', 'sort', 'out', 'life', 'Children', 'are', 'stars', 'third', 'film', 'was', 'Born', 'where', 'two', 'young', 'brothers', 'learn', 'deal', 'moving', 'new', 'neighbourhood', 'new', 'kids', 'block', 'fathers', 'once', 'again', 'play', 'key', 'role', 'family', 'interactions', 'natural', 'acting', 'adults', 'children', 'impressed', 'most', 'films', 'Ozu', 'apparent', 'easy', 'casual', 'approach', 'glimpsing', 'family', 'life', 'understanding', 'compassion', 'little', 'bit', 'wicked', 'humour', 'picture', 'quality', 'Tokyo', 'Chorus', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'high', 'standard', 'others', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'especially', 'optional', 'piano', 'musical', 'score', 'Donald', 'Sosin', 'who', 'fine', 'job', 'adding', 'right', 'ambience', 'scene', 'DVDs', 'have', 'individual', 'slim', 'cases', 'good', 'notes', 'help', 'shed', 'more', 'light', 'overlooked', 'early', 'part', 'Ozu', 'impressive', 'career', 'Ozu', 'silent', 'film', 'collectors', 'alike', 'special', 'unique', 'addition', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

He had already made twenty three films when he embarked on the comedy I Was Born, But.... After finding success with Tokyo Chorus he made his comedy broader but still relied on the family genre in order to get his subtle points about generational gaps across.I Was Born, But.... tells the story of a family newly moved to the Tokyo suburbs so that the father can be closer to his boss. The two sons go through the normal problems associated with any family move. They are picked on by local bullies (including the boss' son) and have problems adapting to their new school. The final straw comes after a game of ""my father is better than your father"" when the boys learn of their father's lowly social position.Ozu would later remake this film as the Technicolor feature Good Morning (1959) but his comic stylings would never be more apparant thatn in the earlier film. This film is a joy to watch and does not have the degree of print damage that Tokyo Chorus has. The film can be viewed with or without a piano score by Donald Sosin and the Japanese intertitles are well translated.This film is a must see for those who are interested in the Ozu canon and is a just plain good film.

Yarbrough,"[25, 25]","From the director of such classics as Late Spring, Tokyo Story, and Floating Weeds, Criterion brings us a 3-disc collection from Japanese auteur Yasujiro Ozu. Although he has not yet reached the wide-spread acclaim of fellow countryman Akira Kurosawa, Ozu is starting to gain the recognition that he rightfully deserves.Ozu began his career as a cameraman, and with hard work and determination he finally ascended the ladder to director. Once his position was earned, Ozu poured his creativity onto film with unmatched diligence, producing nearly half of his 50+ films in the first five years of his career. Sadly, many of these films are now lost, which adds to the enjoyment of these extraordinary, previously unreleased films from Criterion.As the title suggests, the films in this collection were released during a portion of Ozu's silent career, ranging from 1931-1933. Ozu, along with the majority of the Japanese film industry, was somewhat hesitant about entering into talkies based upon the belief that emotions could be best conveyed with movements, expressions, and atmosphere, not dialogue. Ozu's first talkie was not released until 1936, the same year as Chaplin's final silent masterpiece, Modern Times. This period of his career marked Ozu's transition into social criticism as he both subtly and blatantly expresses his discontent with the culture of pre-WWII Japan.Included films:Tokyo Chorus (1931) - A man is fired from his job for reasons that would normally be viewed as commendable. The film from here follows his social and financial downfall as he does anything he possibly can to support his family. As in the other films in this collection, the plot of Tokyo Chorus sounds very dramatic but Ozu has a certain way of shedding a positive light onto each situation.I Was Born, But... (1932) - A story of the hardships of childhood and the ways in which children view their parents in unappreciative and misconstrued ways. A comedy with some serious overtones.Passing Fancy (1933) - The final film in this collection is about the unstable relationship of a widower and his son. It focuses on a child's attempts to help an alcoholic parent while also being resentful of the unstoppable forces of change.And just in case anyone needs to know I'll post the technical aspects of the films as well.Black and White1.33:1Dolby Digital Mono 1.0Not AnamorphicJapanese",5,A resounding scream of silence.,1209081600,"04 25, 2008",2008,2380,"['director', 'such', 'classics', 'Late', 'Spring', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'Criterion', '3-disc', 'collection', 'Japanese', 'auteur', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'not', 'yet', 'reached', 'wide-spread', 'acclaim', 'fellow', 'countryman', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Ozu', 'starting', 'gain', 'recognition', 'rightfully', 'began', 'career', 'cameraman', 'hard', 'work', 'determination', 'finally', 'ascended', 'ladder', 'director', 'position', 'was', 'earned', 'Ozu', 'poured', 'creativity', 'film', 'unmatched', 'diligence', 'producing', 'nearly', 'half', '50+', 'films', 'first', 'five', 'years', 'career', 'Sadly', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'now', 'lost', 'enjoyment', 'extraordinary', 'previously', 'unreleased', 'films', 'Criterion.As', 'title', 'films', 'collection', 'were', 'released', 'portion', 'Ozu', 'silent', 'career', 'ranging', '1931-1933', 'Ozu', 'majority', 'Japanese', 'film', 'industry', 'was', 'somewhat', 'hesitant', 'entering', 'talkies', 'based', 'belief', 'emotions', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'conveyed', 'movements', 'expressions', 'atmosphere', 'not', 'dialogue', 'Ozu', 'first', 'talkie', 'was', 'not', 'released', '1936', 'same', 'year', 'Chaplin', 'final', 'silent', 'masterpiece', 'Modern', 'Times', 'period', 'career', 'marked', 'Ozu', 'transition', 'social', 'criticism', 'subtly', 'blatantly', 'discontent', 'culture', 'pre-WWII', 'Japan.Included', 'films', 'Tokyo', 'Chorus', '1931', 'man', 'fired', 'job', 'reasons', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'viewed', 'commendable', 'film', 'here', 'social', 'financial', 'downfall', 'anything', 'possibly', 'can', 'support', 'family', 'other', 'films', 'collection', 'plot', 'Tokyo', 'Chorus', 'very', 'dramatic', 'Ozu', 'certain', 'way', 'shedding', 'positive', 'light', 'situation.I', 'Was', 'Born', '1932', 'story', 'hardships', 'childhood', 'ways', 'children', 'view', 'parents', 'unappreciative', 'misconstrued', 'ways', 'comedy', 'serious', 'overtones.Passing', 'Fancy', '1933', 'final', 'film', 'collection', 'unstable', 'relationship', 'widower', 'son', 'child', 'attempts', 'help', 'alcoholic', 'parent', 'also', 'being', 'resentful', 'unstoppable', 'forces', 'change.And', 'just', 'case', 'anyone', 'know', ""'ll"", 'post', 'technical', 'aspects', 'films', 'well.Black', 'White1.33:1Dolby', 'Digital', 'Mono', '1.0Not', 'AnamorphicJapanese']",N/A

Now I am an admitted Ozu film lover, which means I find his unique cinematography of a camera that isn't darting all over the place and shots at low levels that make you feel like you are standing (or sitting) there watching what is going on, a very enjoyable way of viewing a film.I also love his simple stories that everyone can relate to, his people are just like our friends, neighbors and families, some of them are sweet, some are stinkers, and many are just doing their best to cope with every day's challenges in life.But a silent Ozu?  I was a little wary, but I did put it on my wishlist, and I'm so glad I did and that one of my sweet relations gave it to me for my birthday, because it is one of Ozu's best!  Ozu's films are always full of gentle and sometimes silly fun and this one did not disappoint.  The two brothers are real characters and along with the kids they meet up with in their new neighborhood, it really was like watching a Japanese version of the Little Rascals. Did you know eating raw sparrow's eggs will make you strong?It soon appears that they get their sense of humour from their father, though as usually happens, they are not as appreciative of it in him.

184898,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,1567302025,Little Roy Blue,"[0, 0]","Maybe the most remarkable thing about Yasujiro Ozu is that he directed great movies at every stage of his career, skillfully transitioning from silent films to B&W; talkies to gorgeous color films.In the U.S., Ozu's later films are commonly available, but his silents have been sadly neglected. This Criterion Collection release, and the separate two-pack that includes the silent version of Floating Weeds, are the only wide releases covering early Ozu thus far. Fortunately, this is a very respectable collection that cherry-picks good movies; ""Tokyo Chorus"" is sometimes referred to as Ozu's first ""major"" movie, while both ""I Was Born, But..."" and ""Passing Fancy"" won the Kinema Jumpo prize for the best Japanese film of the year.All three films have considerable merit. ""Tokyo Chorus"" is the lightest in tone, but contains some interesting social commentary on office and family life. Meanwhile, ""I Was Born, But..."" seems like a simple comedy at first (I misinterpreted it on my initial viewing), but it ends up delivering a surprisingly depressing message about society and its many demeaning hierarchies. Finally, ""Passing Fancy"" is a touching family piece, and it contains one of Ozu's best and most melodramatic scenes (in which a young kid confronts his father over being a lazy parent).As is often the case with the Eclipse series, the prints on these movies are pretty good, but not up to Criterion's best standards. But on the plus side, each movie comes with interesting liner notes that offer valuable context, and the new (I think) scores for the films by Donald Sosin are pleasant and not at all intrusive.In short, this is great stuff. My only complaint is that I want Criterion to release more Ozu! While this is an excellent collection, it deliberately focuses on only one aspect of Ozu's early career - the family dramas that foreshadowed his later work. His more atypical early films, involving college students and gangsters and so on, still need a quality U.S. DVD release. Indeed, it annoys me a little that Criterion pigeonholes Ozu as exclusively a director of family dramas; but I can't complain too much, because no one else is putting out these wonderful movies.",5,Solid collection of a great director's early work,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,2193,"['Maybe', 'most', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'directed', 'great', 'movies', 'stage', 'career', 'skillfully', 'transitioning', 'silent', 'films', 'B', 'W', 'talkies', 'gorgeous', 'color', 'films.In', 'U.S.', 'Ozu', 'later', 'films', 'are', 'commonly', 'available', 'silents', 'have', 'been', 'sadly', 'neglected', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'release', 'separate', 'two-pack', 'silent', 'version', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'are', 'only', 'wide', 'releases', 'covering', 'early', 'Ozu', 'thus', 'far', 'Fortunately', 'very', 'respectable', 'collection', 'cherry-picks', 'good', 'movies', 'Tokyo', 'Chorus', 'sometimes', 'referred', 'Ozu', 'first', 'major', 'movie', 'Was', 'Born', 'Passing', 'Fancy', 'won', 'Kinema', 'Jumpo', 'prize', 'best', 'Japanese', 'film', 'year.All', 'three', 'films', 'have', 'considerable', 'merit', 'Tokyo', 'Chorus', 'lightest', 'tone', 'interesting', 'social', 'commentary', 'office', 'family', 'life', 'Meanwhile', 'Was', 'Born', 'simple', 'comedy', 'first', 'misinterpreted', 'initial', 'viewing', 'up', 'delivering', 'surprisingly', 'depressing', 'message', 'society', 'many', 'demeaning', 'hierarchies', 'Finally', 'Passing', 'Fancy', 'touching', 'family', 'piece', 'one', 'Ozu', 'best', 'most', 'melodramatic', 'scenes', 'young', 'kid', 'father', 'being', 'lazy', 'parent', '.As', 'often', 'case', 'Eclipse', 'series', 'prints', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'Criterion', 'best', 'standards', 'plus', 'side', 'movie', 'interesting', 'liner', 'notes', 'offer', 'valuable', 'context', 'new', 'think', 'scores', 'films', 'Donald', 'Sosin', 'are', 'pleasant', 'not', 'intrusive.In', 'short', 'great', 'stuff', 'only', 'complaint', 'want', 'Criterion', 'release', 'more', 'Ozu', 'excellent', 'collection', 'deliberately', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'Ozu', 'early', 'career', 'family', 'dramas', 'foreshadowed', 'later', 'work', 'more', 'atypical', 'early', 'films', 'involving', 'college', 'students', 'gangsters', 'so', 'still', 'need', 'quality', 'U.S.', 'DVD', 'release', 'Indeed', 'little', 'Criterion', 'Ozu', 'exclusively', 'director', 'family', 'dramas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'else', 'putting', 'out', 'wonderful', 'movies']",N/A

Very touching film.  Now available on DVD.Hideko Takamine, one of the three classic Japanese actreses, with a 60-year-long career died in Tokyo on December 27, 2010 at the age of 86.  Lung cancer.  (Only Setsuko Hara remains of the great three.)Tokyo Chorus was probably Ms. Takamine's second film; she was approximately 6-years-old and just starting a long, varied and successful career.  (Aside: approximately 25 years ago the New Yorker ran a three issue detailed portrate of Ms. Takamine, in which it was revealed that she spent much of her career supporting her extended family, first as a child-star and then through-out her career.) Unfortunately, her only ""mature"" film the 1960 ""When A Woman Ascends the Stairs"" remains the only other of her films available on DVD on Amazon.Do not be put off by the lack of sound.  This is a  classic about childhood seen from a child's eye-view.  A rarity, apparently  newly available.No other director in the world focused on the  day-to-day goings on in an average family.

184902,A3GUNXVYK34085,1567302025,William F. Flanigan Jr.,"[0, 0]","TOKYO CHORUSSimply Delightful!Film = 3-1/2 stars; restoration = barely 1 star.  Talkies came late to Japan.  This film was released in 1931 without a sound track.  Being a silent film, though, is no big deal, because it is directed and performed as if it is a sound film.  Acting is across-the-board outstanding especially the utterly charming performance delivered by Tokihiko Okada (Okada was doing ""Cary Grant"" before Cary Grant was doing Cary Grant!).  Actors know how to address a camera that is only a few meters away unlike many silent movies where actors (mostly from the stage) often come across as caricatures of themselves, since they feel they need to project to the last row of the theater's balcony!  Body language (obvious and subtle) is also a big factor in conveying actors' messages to the audience.  Intertitles are a bit sparse.  The piano score is outstanding.  Restoration seems to be a work in progress.  If a sufficient market emerges for this DVD (it is one in a package of three), perhaps there will be a new release that removes the constant distraction of deterioration.  Bottom line: This is a captivating film that makes you want to watch it a number of times; so you may have a hard time refraining from running it only once in a sitting--I sure did!I WAS BORN BUT ...A Bit Much Of A ""Good"" Thing.Film = barely 3 stars; restoration = 3-1/2 stars.  There's an old saying in acting circles:  Never do a scene with a baby (or a dog) unless you want that scene stolen.  In this film it's kids (and a dog).  And the adult actors suffer big time both in the slice-of-life story line and by being constantly upstaged on screen.  (And their characters don't look especially happy about matters.)  This is a deliciously outrageous film about precocious preteens, but meant for entertaining grown ups (who may also be dealing with unruly kids in the midst of a major cultural upheaval). Just under a dozen child actors are on display with at least two in virtually every scene.  Not only do they carry the film, they are the film!  Many juveniles you have seen before (and will see again) in the director's movies.  The film, though, is too long by at least a third and continuously grows in tediousness and repetition.  Several of the director's trademarked shots of white under garments drying on clotheslines are on display plus electric train engines  that constantly flash by (they seem to be blown-up models in rear-screen  projection) for no apparent reasons (other than to, well, add flash).  The restoration is OK, but wear and deterioration artifacts are visible here and there.  Piano score is fine.  Bottom line:  Fun to watch for about an hour but ... .PASSING FANCYA Pedestrian Film Where Nothing Of Much Interest Transpires.Film = 2 stars; restoration = 2-1/2 stars.  We've all been there: struggling to find the pause button in the dark on your player's remote so you will not miss anything when you are momentarily away from your viewing area.  Well folks, it's not a problem with this movie.  Just keep it running; when you return you will find you have missed nothing of significance!  This is because nothing of significance appears to occur in this film which seems fixated on trivia, fleas (or lice), and fans.  Although the actors sure try to build repore and empathy with viewers, the director seems satisfied with the notion that trivia, fleas, and fans will carry the day.  Not really!  Staying with acting for the moment, it is (for the most part) first rate and you have likely seen (or will see) many of these actors before (or again)--as members of the director's acting company or, more likely, from the ranks of the studio's contract players).  But the actors face a losing battle struggling with a dull script, having to scratch and fan themselves with numbing (pun intended) regularity, and less-than-inspired direction.  (The plot is among the missing and the ending is flat out ridiculous!)  The artificiality of a studio bound production (except for one outdoor scene) is embarrassingly obvious with small sets for both interiors and ""exteriors."" Cinematography suffers from the absence of deep focus.  Costumes rarely change; some characters wear the same costume; it looks like the actors may have had to provide their own wardrobe.  Intertitles and subtitles often occur faster than the speed of speed reading.  The piano score is fine, but it's lively nature can not reanimate dead trivia.  Restoration is not there yet: distracting deterioration artifacts often occur at what seems to be where reel changes took place.  Criterion graphic artists are still having fun frustrating the viewer by making a game of how to turn subtitles (and the piano score) on/off.  Bottom line:  A padded-out featurette that goes nowhere--very slowly.
