1526441,A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y,B00753M8U0,"Greg ""Saganite""","[3, 3]","""Death and Creamation"" is elevated by a wonderfully textured and low-key performance from Brad Dourif, an underrated character actor who probably should be allowed to lead more often.  He brings a nice understated sophistication to his role as a killer and humanizes a character that in a lesser genre film would have been filled by a cartoon monster.This is not brilliant film-making by any stretch, and some of the smaller roles (especially those of the police detective and the bullies) were hammy and unprofessional.  But I was struck by the interestingHarold and MaudemeetsApt Pupilvibe, and the way that the story was propelled by relationships and personalties rather than--as happens too often in horror--mere events.I will even give ""Creamation"" credit for setting up a memorable final ""line,"" the answer to a crossword puzzle clue that fits beautifully.  I'm not sure I would feel that I'd gotten good value if I'd paid more than, say, $10 for this movie, but if you can rent or stream it, you might find it suprisingly diverting and engaging.",4,"Understated, with good lead performances.",1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,1053,"['Death', 'Creamation', 'elevated', 'wonderfully', 'textured', 'low-key', 'performance', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'underrated', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'probably', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'lead', 'more', 'often', 'nice', 'understated', 'sophistication', 'role', 'killer', 'character', 'lesser', 'genre', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'cartoon', 'monster.This', 'not', 'brilliant', 'film-making', 'stretch', 'smaller', 'roles', 'especially', 'police', 'detective', 'bullies', 'were', 'hammy', 'unprofessional', 'was', 'struck', 'interestingHarold', 'MaudemeetsApt', 'Pupilvibe', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'propelled', 'relationships', 'personalties', 'rather', 'happens', 'too', 'often', 'horror', 'mere', 'events.I', 'will', 'even', 'give', 'Creamation', 'credit', 'setting', 'up', 'memorable', 'final', 'line', 'answer', 'crossword', 'puzzle', 'clue', 'beautifully', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'feel', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'good', 'value', ""'d"", 'paid', 'more', 'say', '10', 'movie', 'can', 'rent', 'stream', 'might', 'find', 'suprisingly', 'diverting', 'engaging']",Death and Cremation

Teslovich,"[1, 1]","A creative (meaning not done before, at least quite like this) story of a mistreated, humiliated-at-school goth/loner teen who wouldn't mind some payback upon his tormentors. His struggling, single mom requests that he acquires an after school job (when he bothers to go to school) which ends being with a lonely grizzled crossword puzzle solving cremator (my suspicions about crossword types is now confirmed) who doesn't take kindly to unkind people thus making good use of his skills which his newly hired help is only to willing to also acquire.Nothing too bloody, just the usual red dyed corn syrup splattered in a non-forensically accurate manner.

1526443,A27Y3RZUBWIKWK,B00753M8U0,jonboy,"[1, 1]","This is a very under-rated film that evokes memories of Stephen King's ""Apt Pupil"" without all the character background development. In short, this is a quite creepy and somewhat surprising little thriller involving a high school kid and his ultimate revenge on his tormentors. This revenge results from his unlikely bond with a reclusive mortuary owner who has a secret and strange past. Brad Dourif's excellent characterization of the boy's boss is inspired. The film has fine production values and great cinematography. As a plus, it moves like lightning, leaving no time for wasted scenes involving the background development of Dourif's character. This is left entirely to the viewer's imagination and would, in this reviewer's opinion, likely detract form the film's rapid pace. Sumpter is also very appealing and well cast as the harassed teen who finds his chance for revenge in his new job. Another great example of Indie filmmaking.

1526444,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00753M8U0,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","From Peter Pan to a bullied outcast, Jeremy Sumpter continues to show his tremendous versatility as an actor in Death & Cremation. This cast was the whole reason I wanted to see this movie, but unfortunately it falls well short of my expectations. Stanley (Brad Dourif) is a loner and a serial killer who runs the perfect business for getting rid of evidence, a crematorium. He's a lonely man and nothing exciting happens to him until a loner named Jared (Sumpter) starts working for him. This film tries very hard to be something it's not and that's creepy. Death & Cremation isn't about blood and gore, but rather moves very slowly and methodically in order to try and freak us out, but sadly it doesn't. Stanley and Jared aren't guys you're going to be scared of, more like two guys you'd like to hang out with and that's the problem. The audience can relate to them and isn't scared of them at all. That being the case this film should have gone the other way and been extremely bloody and disturbing, but it's not that either. The story is bland and the movie is slow, but the cast is amazing. Brad Dourif plays a psychopath better than anyone and it really wouldn't surprise me if he is in fact a serial killer. Here he's teamed with one of my absolute favorite actors, who is also superb, but they're giving their all in a slow, sloppy film, that just doesn't cut it.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1374,"['Peter', 'Pan', 'bullied', 'outcast', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'show', 'tremendous', 'versatility', 'actor', 'Death', 'Cremation', 'cast', 'was', 'whole', 'reason', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'well', 'short', 'expectations', 'Stanley', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'loner', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'perfect', 'business', 'getting', 'rid', 'evidence', 'crematorium', 'lonely', 'man', 'nothing', 'exciting', 'happens', 'loner', 'named', 'Jared', 'Sumpter', 'working', 'film', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'creepy', 'Death', 'Cremation', ""n't"", 'about', 'blood', 'gore', 'rather', 'moves', 'very', 'slowly', 'methodically', 'order', 'try', 'freak', 'out', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'Stanley', 'Jared', 'are', ""n't"", 'guys', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'scared', 'more', 'two', 'guys', ""'d"", 'like', 'hang', 'out', 'problem', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', ""n't"", 'scared', 'being', 'case', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'other', 'way', 'been', 'extremely', 'bloody', 'disturbing', 'not', 'either', 'story', 'bland', 'movie', 'slow', 'cast', 'amazing', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'psychopath', 'better', 'anyone', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'fact', 'serial', 'killer', 'Here', 'teamed', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'actors', 'who', 'also', 'superb', ""'re"", 'giving', 'slow', 'sloppy', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut']",Death and Cremation
