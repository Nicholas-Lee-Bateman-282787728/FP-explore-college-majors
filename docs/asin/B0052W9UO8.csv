1438089,A34AWBSX28FA8C,B0052W9UO8,Esmerelda,"[7, 7]","These say artist not provided, but Matsuri Hino, the manga author says she also did the anime. I do think this is spectacular. By far, it's better than any other vampire series I've seen.This is a mystery, a fascinating love triangle. The two male protagonists are fighting over the female lead in the first five minutes of the first episode of the first series, and if you saw this and missed it, go back and look again.It's a serious story with some laugh out loud moments, and also sad.Most of my asian dramas started as mangas, then anime, then live performances. I'm always just amazed at what good storytellers the Japanese are. They really know how to wring every emotion you've got out of you.I just got my copy of Vampire Knight and V.K. Guilty, and I have complaints about the English subtitles.The subber is quite fluent in English, seems British, and the subtitles are excellent.However, I very much dislike when a subber 'cleans' up some language, and waters down the rest-examples in this anime:1.""Hurry up and shoot that bastard!"" becomes ""Hurry and kill that thing.""2.""My precious girl has been bitten by another"" becomes ""someone else bit the girl who is dear to me.""3.""Cute Yuki"" becomes ""Dear Yuki. 'Dear' is used in several other places, replacing other terms.4. 'Prefect' becomes  'Member of the Disciplinary Committee'5. ""Damn it!"" becomes ""Darn it.""6. ""My gorgeous Vampires"" becomes ""fairly good-looking"" vampires.7. When Yuki has Zero thinking ""Don't praise those bastards in front of me!"", 'bastards' is replaced by something mild and inoffensive.8. ""Call out the name of your lover"" becomes ""call out the name of the one you love.""9. ""You've made Yuki your lover!"" becomes ""You've asked Yuki to become your lover!""For me, this person took all the impact out of these scenes and just made them boring, (very annoying)POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT FOR SOME COMING UP NOW: I'm writing these spoilers/clues because the mangas were very confusing for me and I had to read them several times to figure out who was saying what, and why it seemed to jump to the next thing without warning me.If you buy these anime sets and read the following mangas, starting w/10, you will be able to figure some significant things out.If you think about each characters' focus, and don't waver on that. you will know a lot. Kaname is always always focused on protecting Yuki, and EVERYTHING he does is for her protection. Kaien Cross is focused on keeping peace between vampires and humans, even though he becomes the president of the Hunter Society. Zero is always focused on being intimate with Yuki, no matter how much he denies it.Keep these main things in mind and it won't be so confusing.Beyond that, they ALL protect Yuki, PLUS Aido is still her bodyguard. Someone refers to her as the ""overprotected princess.""So-4 attractive men/vampires protecting Yuki. And Kaname has put three of them in place for her. Remember his chess set?Who is the enemy of the purebloods? Well-who killed the first two? Now you know. Why? Just think about why he does anything.Also-new mystery: WHO is Yuki??? Kaname says her eyes are familiar when he first sees her as a newborn, but he can't remember where and when he saw her. (Could she be the woman her loved back in the beginning?) They have her always with a hood over her head, but you can see some of her face, and her eyes could be Yukis'.Also! Just my opinion, but someone needs to take the 'Bloody Rose' away from Zero! He points that thing at someone every time he gets mad.Maria told Zero in Vampire Knight Guilty that someone set his parents up to kill Hio Shizuka's lover. Zero figures out who. He also figures out why, and he tells Yuki that person killed his parents and ruined his (Zero's) and Ichiru's life, and he's right.Someone in Vampire Knight Guilty claims to have ""created"" Zero to protect Yuki and to kill Rido, rather than just happenstance  making use of his (Zero's) love for Yuki.There's also the chained up monstervampire or something-I have no clue whatsoever who that is. Rido told Kaname in VKG that he chained him/her up.Shocking stuff coming up: Kaname beheads Aido's father right in front of Yuki and Aido! I don't need to ask why-if you saw what Aido's father did in Vampire Knight Guilty, you will know why too. But why in front of them like THAT???Two more purebloods show up and are harassing Yuki-guess who's going to die NEXT?Meanwhile, Kaien Cross, who just wants peace, has lost his understanding of Kaname, and wants to stop the slaughter. Scary stuff now-he's threatening to kill Kaname, and has even drawn his sword and is menacing him...AND-while Kaname is out doing God Knows What, and Yuki can't find him-like someone said, don't stick a fork in her and Zero yet, because they can't keep their hands off each other, they absolutely magnetize each other.There is a very sweet picture in the manga with Kaname holding newborn Yuki in his arms (He's still a kid), and the posture of his whole body shows how utterly, totally, he loves her.Addendum: I just realized (maybe) why Kaname beheaded Aido's father in front of Aido. He needed to SEVERELY test Aido's loyalty, because Aido is always with Yuki-and must never fail to give everything to protect her.OK-2 more volumes left to go and here are some of the mysteries left to be solved: 1. Who is the chained up person in Kaname's mind?2. Who is the fake head of the Kuran family that Rido mentioned? Did Rido chain up the real Kaname-or something like that?3. Rido also said he had to steal Haruka and Jury's first child so that his ultimate servant could be born-what is that about? Is he referring to Shiki and his mother?4. Why did Kaname say that Yuki was getting in his way-it sounds like he wants to kill her. Does he not know she was probably his first lover? (when he was the Kuran progenitor) 5. Will the question of Zero's longevity be answered? Is he getting secret blood we don't know about? Did he lose his ""level E"" status when he ate Ichiru? What? I hope that question doesn't go unanswered-Back to the DVD's-a clever verbal device is used thru-out the story: someone asks a question, and the next word out of someone else's mouth is the answer.",5,SPECTACULAR,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,6195,"['say', 'artist', 'not', 'provided', 'Matsuri', 'Hino', 'manga', 'author', 'also', 'did', 'anime', 'do', 'think', 'spectacular', 'far',

1438093,A1KAUV9QYLP52J,B0052W9UO8,Kellyannl,"[1, 1]","With Amazon having corrected the glitch which merged reviews of both parts of Vampire Knight, Guilty, the second limited series, can now be reviewed in it's own right.  Guilty hones the good elements of the first set and improves on them in almost every way.Things begin with an uneasy truce between Kaname and Zero for Yuki's sake, and sure enough trouble finds it's way to Cross Academy in the form of the living being whom Zero hates most.  Even worse, an old enemy of Kaname, with the aid of a despicably dirty move against a Night Class member of Kaname's circle and help from Ichijo's slimy grandfather, arrives to tear down everything Cross Academy stands for.  Amidst personal dramas being played out, the war between the old school vampires and the human friendly Night Class is about to begin...There is, of course, heavy duty drama between the primary Yuki-Kaname-Zero triangle, two of whom experience life altering events; but the supporting cast shines as well.  Events force Ichijo into a terrible balancing act between the interests of the two people closest to him, and it might be his surprisingly serious cliffhanging final scene more than anything else that will leave fans not familiar with the manga heading to their bookstores post haste to find out what happened next.  As in the manga, Yuki's relationship with Aido is a highlight, his empathy for her plight overriding his jealousy in proportion to her situation worsening. He eventually becomes the character who offers both Yuki and the audience some relief from the weight of her heavier relationships with Kaname and Zero.The climax goes down slightly differently from how it did in the manga, but leaves the characters in essentially the same place.  Fans will, of course, want more; but if the anime is never continued it must be said that this wasn't a bad point to end it if it joins manga based anime that did not follow it's source material to it's conclusion.  Vampire Knight might not be high art, but Guilty does deliver the goods to fans who enjoy unabashed melodrama - and deliver them well.I will end with a technical postscript alerting that, as with the first set, disk one is in an unusual double-sided format.",4,The Battle for Cross Academy,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,2204,"['Amazon', 'having', 'corrected', 'glitch', 'merged', 'reviews', 'parts', 'Vampire', 'Knight', 'Guilty', 'second', 'limited', 'series', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'reviewed', 'own', 'right', 'Guilty', 'good', 'elements', 'first', 'set', 'improves', 'almost', 'way.Things', 'begin', 'uneasy', 'truce', 'Kaname', 'Zero', 'Yuki', 'sake', 'sure', 'enough', 'trouble', 'way', 'Cross', 'Academy', 'form', 'living', 'being', 'whom', 'Zero', 'most', 'Even', 'worse', 'old', 'enemy', 'Kaname', 'aid', 'despicably', 'dirty', 'move', 'Night', 'Class', 'member', 'Kaname', 'circle', 'help', 'Ichijo', 'slimy', 'grandfather', 'tear', 'down', 'everything', 'Cross', 'Academy', 'Amidst', 'personal', 'dramas', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'war', 'old', 'school', 'vampires', 'human', 'friendly', 'Night', 'Class', 'begin', 'course', 'heavy', 'duty', 'drama', 'primary', 'Yuki-Kaname-Zero', 'triangle', 'two', 'whom', 'experience', 'life', 'altering', 'events', 'supporting', 'cast', 'shines', 'as', 'well', 'Events', 'force', 'Ichijo', 'terrible', 'balancing', 'act', 'interests', 'two', 'people', 'closest', 'might', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'serious', 'cliffhanging', 'final', 'scene', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'will', 'leave', 'fans', 'not', 'familiar', 'manga', 'heading', 'bookstores', 'post', 'haste', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'manga', 'Yuki', 'relationship', 'Aido', 'highlight', 'empathy', 'plight', 'overriding', 'jealousy', 'proportion', 'situation', 'worsening', 'eventually', 'character', 'who', 'Yuki', 'audience', 'relief', 'weight', 'heavier', 'relationships', 'Kaname', 'Zero.The', 'climax', 'down', 'slightly', 'differently', 'how', 'did', 'manga', 'characters', 'essentially', 'same', 'place', 'Fans', 'will', 'course', 'want', 'more', 'anime', 'never', 'continued', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'point', 'end', 'manga', 'based', 'anime', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'source', 'material', 'conclusion', 'Vampire', 'Knight', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'high', 'art', 'Guilty', 'deliver', 'goods', 'fans', 'who', 'enjoy', 'unabashed', 'melodrama', 'deliver', 'will', 'end', 'technical', 'postscript', 'alerting', 'that', 'first', 'set', 'disk', 'one', 'unusual', 'double-sided', 'format']",Vampire Knight Guilty: Complete Series

In this part there is more focus on Yuki discovering her lost past, her struggles, and her connection to Kaname. Zero comes into himself as well. There was a twist about Yuki's past that I didn't see coming. Also some secrets about Kaname are revealed (about his pure blood origins). There are some subplots about the remaining vampires which are interesting and intricately woven into the story, as well.The only complaint I have is that the last 4 episodes were kind of weak, especially when compared to the previous really good episodes.Also the ending was not really satisfying. This needed an additional episode to show (mild spoilers) how Yuki is settling into her new life at Kaname's side, and what Zero is up to now that he's gained his powers.But overall this was a good and intense season, with some great parts.In the end, the Vampire Knight series is a riveting series that will have you marathon through episodes, just to see what happens next!Edited to add: The dvd set contains both English and Japanese audio, and English/Japanese subtitles.

The voice acting at first in the first season is a bit rough to get used to if you're doing dub but it grows on you and before you know it, your so caught up in the story that its no longer a thought. This is the second season however and I must say, its much much better than the first season. Very suspenseful and more action. Gives you a more in depth feel to the anime and it leaves off with one hell of an ending. I doubt there will be a season three, but it leaves you wanting more so I hope there is. Won't be disappointed in adding this to your collection",5,I hope theres a third season!,1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,603,"['vampire', 'knight', 'series', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'acting', 'first', 'first', 'season', 'bit', 'rough', 'get', 'used', ""'re"", 'doing', 'dub', 'know', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'longer', 'thought', 'second', 'season', 'however', 'must', 'say', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'Very', 'suspenseful', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'depth', 'feel', 'anime', 'one', 'hell', 'ending', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'season', 'three', 'wanting', 'more', 'so', 'hope', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'adding', 'collection']",Vampire Knight Guilty: Complete Series
