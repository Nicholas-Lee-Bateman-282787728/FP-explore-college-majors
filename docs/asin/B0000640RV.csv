697114,A63U10XVV66X8,B0000640RV,Arthur Tirrell,"[1, 3]","In this 2001 romantic comedy, an insensitive self-help columnist becomes famous when her out-of-work boyfriend starts writing her column for her. It's a promising setup, but falls short of it's potential. Unlike ""Just Write"", a starless film with a hokey set piece that somehow becomes more than the sum of its parts, ""Good Advice"" fails to convince. Charlie Sheen is handsome as boyfriend Ryan Turner, but although he's brought low in the setup, the defeat he suffers is shallow, entirely not his own fault. As a result, we don't root as hard for him to rise again - which the plot cleverly has him do as the surprisingly wise advice columnist of Page Hensen's (Angie Harmon) shoestring newspaper operation. Sheen is handsome and Harmon gorgeous, but where's the juice? To be honest I was more attracted to the seventy-year-old orange-haired secretary. At least she added some spark to situations.It still could have worked, but the mechanical interaction between Sheen and Harmon killed the possibility. ""Just Write"" overcame its hokey set piece, but ""Good Advice"", while charming at times, never rises to the level of believability.

I thought, ""Do I really want to waste money on a movie that I won't enjoy?"" But being a die hard fan of Charlie Sheen ever since I saw him as the football jock in Lucas, I took a chance. So I spent my money and here is my opinion of GOOD ADVICE.First of all, the supporting cast is hysterical! Jon Lovitz and Rosanna Arquette as a married couple. He plays Barry, a plastic surgeon and she is Kathy, his money hungry wife. Estelle Harris plays Iris, a sweet old lady who works at the paper. Ex Melrose Place alumn Lisa Rinna has a bit part as Veronica Simpson, the wife of newspaper mogul Donald Simpson.The plot is very simple. We meet Ryan Turner (Sheen) who loses a successful job due to insider trading. He is to much of a risk to go work for one of his competators, so he is out of a job. Turner's girlfriend (Richards) is bored and unhappy at her job. She writes for her own advice column, ""Ask Cindy."" Without telling her boss, or her best friend, Cindy boards a plane to Brazil and no one except Ryan knows she's gone. In need of a paycheck, he assume's Cindy's identity and takes over her column. Ryan is also falling head over heels with Cindy's editor, Paige. (Harmon) In time, everyone is asking ""Where is Cindy?"" Finally, thanks to Ryan, he has turned this fading column into a popular paper. Now, Cindy returns and the sparks are about to fly! I was not disappointed at all with this movie. It was funny, sweet, romantic, sexy, and smart.

697129,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B0000640RV,Martin Asiner,"[3, 5]","In GOOD ADVICE, director Steve Rash presents a view of upper class urban life that is supposed to be funny in a slapstick sort of way but quickly enough morphs into the world of fairy tales that is unified only by the most unlikely concatenations of events. Charley Sheen reprises his WALL STREET role as an upward bound stock broker who, in this film, has learned that humor can be the leavening agent to success that was denied him by his earlier confrontations with Gordon Gekko. Sheen has a live in girlfriend (Denise Richards) who comes across as exactly the sort of blonde bimbo airhead who has little success as a girlfriend and less as a lonelyhearts advice columnist. Richards dumps Sheen because he has lost his job in a manner that draws uncomfortable dramatic parallels with his previous WALL STREET role. He becomes boozy, depressed, and frankly not a little pathetic in his slovenliness. After Richards exits for Brazil, Sheen needs a job. Then he gets a bright idea. Why not take over hers? First, he must convince Richards' boss (Angie Harmon), who can't make up her mind whether to toss Sheen out of her office or into her bed. At this point, GOOD ADVICE has already crossed the line into a Drew Barrymore fairy tale where things and events always break exactly right for all concerned. I kept waiting for reality to intrude. When Harmon pays Sheen with a paycheck for his columns that she thinks Richards is writing, I wondered when he would ask her to write the check in his own name since he could not cash checks in Richards' name. Jon Lovitz and Roseanna Arquette are only props for Sheen to bounce off of. Estelle Harris is more amusing as an oversexed septuagenerian who saves the day. Not for one moment did I accept the plot premise that Angie Harmon might not fall for the manly charms of Charley Sheen, but then again, in light fluffy romantic comedies like GOOD ADVICE, all that is required to maintain viewer interest is for the cast to pretend that they like each other, or failing that, hate each other.

This is a rare movie in that I watch it over and over again. It's a romantic comedy that is just plain old ENTERTAINING. No swearing, nudity, or violence. Slight sexual parts in the movie but no visible nudity.

But I couldnt ignore the overly positive reviews so I went ahead & watched it.No need to go in to plots & etc as plenty of reviews cover everything, but I did want to chime in with the above & to say I'd give this 6 stars if I could.It was fantastic.Do yourself a favor & check it out. Im shocked that I liked this movie as much as I did, but it was great in every way & character.Whoever wrote the script also delivers much praise!",5,Shocked!
