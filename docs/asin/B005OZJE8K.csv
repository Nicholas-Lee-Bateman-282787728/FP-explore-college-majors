Soaron was my favorite character and Lord Dredd reminded me of Darth Vader.Two series which should have been given a proper and more thorough treatment was Captain Power and Sledge Hammer. It's unfortunate the studios/ realising companies couldn't restore the original picture quality from the film itself and not the video masters whether they are in Betacam or U-Matic or other medium.Since I have to see NTSC video on a PAL Plasma screen, the vertical lines are stretched to fill the 1,33:1 image and therefore the quality loses a bit of quality when taken from old tapes. Just like the 7th season of MacGyver for example or the video they took out of the Mission Impossible 80's series.Nevertheless if you like science fiction and The Terminator movies and CGI characters, you'll love this series set on a post-apocalyptic (yet again) Earth.

1496980,A218A1NFBSHZ0U,B005OZJE8K,David B. Minter,"[5, 6]","This DVD set receives 4 stars because of the strength of the quality of the scripts, from such writers as contributors to Babylon 5, Beast Wars, Real Ghostbusters, and He-Man.  I deducted 1 star for some quality control issues in the official release of the DVD set.The video quality is okay, although there are places where the occasional artifact pops up.  It looks like the producers just fed the masters into encoding software and didn't check the results afterwards to manually clean up any effects left behind.The audio is a disappointment, too.  The music and sound effects drown out the dialogue on many occasions.Some episodes are missing title, writer, and director credits.I had difficulty removing and then reinserting the 3rd and 4th discs into the packaging.  They could have come up with a better way to package the DVD's so you don't risk damaging them.  In fact, after some attempts to reinsert the discs where they belong, the case would not fit back inside its slip cover.In many ways, the unofficial fan made DVD sets that came out before VSC's official DVD release are better in this aspect.  What this set has going for it though is a fine collection of bonus features that only an official studio release can obtain.  There's a 90 minute documentary about the making of Captain Power.  There's actor, writer, and creator commentary on 6 selected episodes.  There's The Legend Begins, the compilation TV movie shown in markets mostly outside of the US around 1989.  There's a bonus that offers glimpses into the future of Captain Power had it continued on to a 2nd season, with many previous only before hinted at revelations about what that 2nd season would have been like.Bottom line is, the package isn't the best it could be, but, it could be a lot worse.

It was Saturday morning and you'd have just washed your uniforms and you ironed them while watching CAPTAIN POWER on Armed Forces Network. This was a clever series that made the most of its budget and tried to frontier an interesting connection between the TV program itself and kids who owned the toys. I enjoyed how both Captain Power and Lord Dread would yearly go to the grave site of Captain Jonathan Power's father and pay their respects on hallowed ground. They both knew one another was in the vicinity. But neither fired on the other. It was in this one place where civility won out over savagery. That scene stays in your head 25 years later.

A somewhat derivative science fiction series that blended live action with (state-of-the-art at the time, especially for TV) CG effects along with interactivity at home, delivering a positive message through an action-packed post-apocalyptic war each week before it was prematurely cancelled after only one season over complaints about manipulative marketing and perceived concerns over violent content (in that area, this show seemed a lot more appropriate for kids than another popular sci fi show of the time, ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" which regularly featured sexual themes, gore, violence, etc).However, sadly this set lacks in one area... the packaging!

1496988,A178E629GFPENS,B005OZJE8K,LMI,"[4, 4]","OMG, I thought this day would never come.Firstly, I'd like to say when I got this boxed set, Parts 1 and 2 of ""The Summoning of Thunder"" absolutely refused to play. Amazon had already sent out my replacement copy before I had my mailing label printed out to return the poorly functioning set back. The replacement set works fine, big kudos for a trouble free exchange with amazon.Now back to the series...When this series first came out, like a lot of other sci-fi fans, I was chased away by the title. Then I heard reviews and decided I had to watch for myself,...and was I ever glad I did. The storytelling was amazing and created a Nazi era style world of machines bent on the destruction of all flesh and emotion.In the distant future, wars were fought by robots called bio-mechs. Human casualties became virtually non-existent which made war commonplace and easy. Enter Captain Power's Father, Dr Stuart Gordon Power and Dr Power's friend and colleague Dr Lyman Taggart. Their plan was to create a supercomputer named Overmind that could override and take control of all the warring biomechs on the planet, thus ending all war once and for all. But where Dr Power felt more testing was necessary, Taggart impatiently went behind his back and hooked himself up to Overmind. The experience changed both Taggart and Overmind, and the next day bio-mechs were marching into cities worldwide.The series was the first to have CGI characters. For those used to the Digital age with smoother looking integrations of computer animation with real life, this is the series that started it all. Younger impatient types might call it cheap or even primitive, but they weren't generating the CGI characters of this series with the small hand held devices we have today. It took hard work, multiple camera angles, and multiple, slower, computers.The fight scenes were also not the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon kind of today. It was the 80's afterall. But the storytelling came from the likes of J Michael Straczynski (Babylon Five), Gerry Davis (the original 1963 Dr Who), Larry Ditillio (He-Man, Shera, Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, B5, Bionic 6...take your pick), Christy Marx (JEM, B5, GI Joe, and the 1978 Fantastic Four), and Gary Goddard (Star Trek...the ORIGINAL Star Trek).These same writers would go on to write the (at the time) new Star Trek: The Next Generation and Babylon 5 series. And you see hints of Captain Power in those series. People look at Lord Dread and comment on how he looks exactly like a Borg. Why did they copy from Star Trek, is what is often asked. They didn't. Dread came first, the Borg second. People were digitized in Captain Power first, assimilated by the Borg later on. When Tank talks about his escape from the genetic engineering lab, the name of the lab is Babylon 5.And then there are storylines with horror taken from history...mass genocide of humanity, a Dread Youth, much like the Hitler Youth, people being taken to places they don't come back from...in the episode ""Pariah"", Mitch talks about being in a lab where he was experimented on with others, and where he saw lifeless bodies being carried out, never to be seen again. In the episode ""Judgment"", Pilot confronts her former life as a member of the Dread Youth and the uniform she used to wear. She is put on trial by a group of townspeople who survived the fiery destruction of her first outing with her Dread Unit. Like Holocaust survivors pointing out Nazi oppressors, ""It was you...It was you."" There was an unaired, unproduced episode that had Dread ordering the burning of all books, destroying human culture. Historical memories with a very personal, emotional touch. That is what made this series great.This packet does have some equally nice gems in it. The Making of Captain Power (Out of the Ashes) had fantastic info of behind the scenes of the first season and what was contemplated if a second season were produced.There is also an original, unaired (in the US) TV movie called ""The Legend Begins."" Essentially it is the entire first season compressed into a movie format. It's very rough editting, and Soaron has a different sounding voice, but it has some interesting moments. There are two in particular:1. In Retribution Pt II, after giving false info to the Power team on orders of Lord Dread, Locke strikes the Overunit Commander. Locke's obviously disgusted with the betrayal he just committed but we don't know why. In the unaired movie, Locke asks the Overunit commander, ""What about my kids?"" It's a bit hard envisioning Locke married, never mind with kids, but interesting none the less.2. At the very end of Retribution Pt II, we see Pilot finally confess her love to Jon Power as she presses the self destruct blowing up the Power base, destroying Blastarr, and keeping resistance info out of Dread's hands. What we don't see in that episode, but do in the unaired movie, is Jon Power responding to Pilot over the com silently mouthing the words ""I love you"" just as Pilot blows up the Power Base.Gary Goddard has hinted that one day Captain Power might return as a TV series or movie...half of me is excited at the prospect, the other half leary given some of the horrible remakes I have seen.

Used to watch it religiously as a kid.Sadly, it simply doesn't quite stand the test of time. It's really campy, very 80's. The CGI  simply wasn't there yet in the 80's/90's and it looks pretty terrible / blocky / jerky / repetitive.On the plus side there are one or two featurettes that make the set worthwhile and give some of the history of why / who it got produced. The perils and pitfalls of TV production, toy design, etc. The features were interesting.The show itself was actually pretty bad. For a kids' show, okay, it was cool for dealing with adult themes and not ""pandering"" or ""talking down"" to kids. Things that perhaps wouldn't fly today? But it was pretty campy and over-wrought... The stuff better left to fuzzy childhood memories. The first few episodes, especially, were almost painful to watch (in the featurettes they do kind of explain a little about the first few episodes). They eventually got slightly better, but overall it was still pretty silly stuff.",3,"Ahh, what can I say about this series?

The bad news is that its a mixed bag of low quality video and good effort extras. To start, the box set is a nice clam shell design with a nice 6 page booklet filled with some pictures and art work. In the booklet creator/producer Gary Goddard has written a lengthy journal entry about the show and the DVDs. He mentions that the video on the DVD is the highest quality they could make for this release. So what we get is the complete series spread across 3 discs with a fourth discs for extras. That's an average of 8 episodes per disc. I don't know if having that many episodes per disc matters, or if its just the age of the source material, but the video quality is mediocre. I want to say its VHS quality, or at least that was my initial reaction. I tried to enhance the video with up scaling and various settings on my blu-ray player, but none seemed to give the picture much of a boost. The sound is good, but occasionally has some artifacts.So is this bad? As a fan of Captain Power I'm very happy that we got this. Even if its not the greatest, it's still the entire series. It's also very apparent that an effort has been made to give the fans what they want. There is commentary by actors Tim Dunigan (Capt Power) and Jessica Steen (Pilot) on the final two episodes, lots of neat things on the extra disc that are actually worth watching, and even season 2 artwork on the booklet. In short this whole set is a love letter to the fans.I doubt that we will get better than this. This is a 25 year old show with a cult following, but not a mainstream following. I doubt it will win over any new fans given the aged picture quality. It's still a good show. The acting, writing, and even Pilot's 80's flavor hairstyle still work. The strange strobe effects that were supposed to work with the toys are still there too. Just don't expect blu-ray quality for the picture. The picture is far better than Youtube, and good enough to enjoy watching.If you are a fan, its worth it.All discs worked fine for me.",4,Good buy for any fan.,1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,2080,"['long', 'last', 'Captain', 'Power', 'available', 'DVD', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'mixed', 'bag', 'low', 'quality', 'video', 'good', 'effort', 'extras', 'start', 'box', 'set', 'nice', 'clam', 'shell', 'design', 'nice', '6', 'page', 'booklet', 'filled', 'pictures', 'art', 'work', 'booklet', 'creator/producer', 'Gary', 'Goddard', 'written', 'lengthy', 'journal', 'entry', 'show', 'DVDs', 'video', 'DVD', 'highest', 'quality', 'could', 'make', 'release', 'So', 'what', 'get', 'complete', 'series', 'spread', '3', 'discs', 'fourth', 'discs', 'extras', 'average', '8', 'episodes', 'disc', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'having', 'many', 'episodes', 'disc', 'matters', 'just', 'age', 'source', 'material', 'video', 'quality', 'mediocre', 'want', 'say', 'VHS', 'quality', 'least', 'was', 'initial', 'reaction', 'tried', 'enhance', 'video', 'up', 'scaling', 'various', 'settings', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'none', 'seemed', 'give', 'picture', 'much', 'boost', 'sound', 'good', 'occasionally', 'artifacts.So', 'bad', 'fan', 'Captain', 'Power', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'got', 'Even', 'not', 'greatest', 'still', 'entire', 'series', 'also', 'very', 'apparent', 'effort', 'been', 'made', 'give', 'fans', 'what', 'want', 'commentary', 'actors', 'Tim', 'Dunigan', 'Capt', 'Power', 'Jessica', 'Steen', 'Pilot', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'lots', 'neat', 'things', 'extra', 'disc', 'are', 'actually', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'season', '2', 'artwork', 'booklet', 'short', 'whole', 'set', 'love', 'letter', 'fans.I', 'doubt', 'will', 'get', 'better', '25', 'year', 'old', 'show', 'cult', 'following', 'not', 'mainstream', 'following', 'doubt', 'will', 'win', 'new', 'fans', 'given', 'aged', 'picture', 'quality', 'still', 'good', 'show', 'acting', 'writing', 'even', 'Pilot', '80', 'flavor', 'hairstyle', 'still', 'work', 'strange', 'strobe', 'effects', 'were', 'supposed', 'work', 'toys', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'too', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'blu-ray', 'quality', 'picture', 'picture', 'far', 'better', 'Youtube', 'good', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'are', 'fan', 'worth', 'it.All', 'discs', 'worked', 'fine']",Captain Power-Complete Series
