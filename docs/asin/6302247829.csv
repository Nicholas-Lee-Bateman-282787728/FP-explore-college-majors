303754,A3RODEQMP1IY51,6302247829,"Allison Fox ""Film Fanatic & Philosopher""","[1, 9]","This movie was nothing like I expected.  I don't know exactly what I was expecting.... but whatever it was ... it wasn't what I got.  The cover of the movie is quite deceptive.  On the back of the movie when they say that pin is a harmless deaf mute ... I still kind of thought he was alive or something, but he is just a dummy.  I felt bad for the 2 children in the movie ... anyone living under the conditions in their parents house would probably end up going insane or atleast having some severe emotional or psychological issues.  So throughout the movie it was hard for me to not feel sorry for Leon (I love David Hewlett - CUBE is soooo much better though).  It isn't Leon's fault that his mom was an obsessive compulsive cleaning freak and his dad was a weird and strict, uncaring person.  So what if that leads him to believe that his fathers medical dummy is his friend?  Pin was much nicer than his parents.  So I can't really blame him.  A child who has to live under those conditions is bound to have some kind of way to cope with all that is going on.  Pin was there to help him.  Perhaps there could have been better ways to help Leon than to convince him to kill people (although I cannot place the blame on poor Pin... he is just an innocent by-stander ... especially in the scene where the nurse does bad things to him!!  Naughty naughty!) but the idea of Pin being real was all in Leon's head... I really wish someone had gotten him help... especially his sister who seemed very oblivious to what was going on and when she finally did figure out that Leon was mental ... she just went on with her little life and didn't bother to get him some treatment.  All in all, I've seen better movies, of course.  But I've also seen much worse.",2,I've seen better...,1009152000,"12 24, 2001",2001,1753,"['movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'expected', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'whatever', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'got', 'cover', 'movie', 'quite', 'deceptive', 'back', 'movie', 'when', 'say', 'pin', 'harmless', 'deaf', 'mute', 'still', 'kind', 'thought', 'was', 'alive', 'something', 'just', 'dummy', 'felt', 'bad', '2', 'children', 'movie', 'anyone', 'living', 'conditions', 'parents', 'house', 'would', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'insane', 'atleast', 'having', 'severe', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'issues', 'So', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Leon', 'love', 'David', 'Hewlett', 'CUBE', 'soooo', 'much', 'better', ""n't"", 'Leon', 'fault', 'mom', 'was', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'cleaning', 'freak', 'dad', 'was', 'weird', 'strict', 'uncaring', 'person', 'what', 'believe', 'fathers', 'medical', 'dummy', 'friend', 'Pin', 'was', 'much', 'nicer', 'parents', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'child', 'who', 'live', 'conditions', 'bound', 'have', 'kind', 'way', 'cope', 'going', 'Pin', 'was', 'there', 'help', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'ways', 'help', 'Leon', 'convince', 'kill', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'place', 'blame', 'poor', 'Pin', 'just', 'innocent', 'by-stander', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'nurse', 'bad', 'things', 'Naughty', 'naughty', 'idea', 'Pin', 'being', 'real', 'was', 'Leon', 'head', 'really', 'wish', 'someone', 'had', 'gotten', 'help', 'especially', 'sister', 'who', 'seemed', 'very', 'oblivious', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'when', 'finally', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'Leon', 'was', 'mental', 'just', 'went', 'little', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'get', 'treatment', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'movies', 'course', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'much', 'worse']",Pin VHS

I know I am going to seem like I am exaggerating, but this is up there with Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho'! The film was superbly directed and the score was superb. Fine acting by Hewlett and Preston.This is the type of film that gets under your skin, and frightens you more than any ""horror porn"" that gets spit out by Hollywood on massive levels, because this film is real. It's villain is just human being which makes it so much more terrifying and tragic because we watch this so called villain grow up and understand why he is the way he is, and then we realize his eventual fate.A brilliant film, I recommend this to all. But I'm sad to see that the manufacturer discontinued this release.  It's a must for any horror fan.

303756,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,6302247829,Amy Lynn,"[2, 16]","Don't let the cool cover and misleading reviews fool you. This movie is quite bad.Plot-  An upper-middle class family, all of them, mom & dad, brother and sister are VERY strange. The whole situation is weird- The way they act with eachother. The movie starts off with the kids, ''Leon the brother and Ursula the sister'' when they were little. The father uses an anatomical dummy named ''Pin'' to teach the children about life and sex. He pretends Pin is talking when its just him using ventriloquism but the children actually believe Pin's talking to them. Let me remind you , this dummy isnt scary at all but everyone in the neighborhood and everyone who meets ''Pin'' is scared of it.One night Leon's parents get into an accident and the sister and brother are now alone with eachother. Leon is now in his late teens and has started talking to Pin and pretending hes a real human. He took over Daddys place. Obviously, it seems schizophrenia runs in the family. Leon talks to Pin nightly, has conversations with him, brings him to the dinner table, etc. The sister sits there and takes Leons crazy actions and strange behavior with Pin and never asserts herself hardly. She seems scared of Leon, which is a joke because the guy is a wimp. I guess his ''mental illness'' scares her. But at the end you wonder why would she be? it turns out she obviously has some demons of her own.Leon is very over protective of Ursula and theres definitely some incestuous undertones going on in that house. He gets jealous when she starts dating a guy and when the guy comes over he starts reading his ''poetry''. I cant say whats its about on this site, but you can only guess. Hint- its about his sister and some deviant fantasy.Everyone that comes over or comes in contact with 'Pin' seems terrified of it. Not of Leon, i can see them being a little weirded out by Leon, but not Pin. For example, Leon gives his Aunt a heart attack just by her seeing Pin. When Pin appears she has a heart attack. Give me a break, if you were to see this dummy in real life it would never scare you. It looks like a regular manican from a doctors office.You can guess what happens at the end, its not that hard to predict. Leon gets so jealous of the girlfriends new boyfriend, what do you think happens?This really could have been a good movie. The whole story if done well it could have succeeded.. but.. The acting, the plot holes, the very NOT scary dummy, it just didnt work. This movie isnt scary its more of a look at some kind of mental illness but it just didnt convince me. I couldnt take this movie seriously. Was it the mediocre/bad acting? Was it the unscary manican named 'Pin'' or just not a good movie, maybe a mixture.This movie played out like a soap opera. It was soap opera acting, it didnt even cut it as TV movie of the week material. It had promise but it was done in the wrong way.I wonder about the reviewers who gave this movie 4 or 5 stars, havent they ever seen a good movie before? This is 3 at best, just for the concept. Factor in the acting and everything else , 2 and a half stars.If youre looking for a horror movie, this isnt it. If youre looking for a weird pyschological drama, this is it, but its not a good one.

303765,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6302247829,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 6]","""Pin"" is a nice psychological thriller although not a true horror film in the strict sense of the term.  Basically, ""Pin"" is about a very strange family, much like my ex-wife's family and that is no lie.  At any rate, the father (a physician) of this strange family seems to have some difficulty communicating with his children in the conventional way.  Therefore, he creates an alternate entity or person named ""Pin"" who is really nothing more than a model in a doctor's office.  However, Pin, the person, takes care of unenviable tasks like talking to the kids about sex and other sensitive issues.  The problem here is the psychological development of the children.While Ursula develops rather nicely except for maybe an all too active libido, Leon fails to progress in his development.  In fact, Leon becomes attached to and obsessed with Pin, and refuses to allow the idea that Pin does not really exist to enter his head.  So, instead of dealing with reality as it is, Leon remains in this imaginary world of Pin.  In a sense, what we have here is a deviation from the movie ""Psycho"" where Leon ends up giving half of his life to Pin much the same way Norman Bates gave half of his life to his dead mother.  Obviously, Leon suffers from severe emotional and mental distress.  Ultimately, Leon becomes a classic paranoid schizophrenic, and after his parents' death, Leon becomes determined to make Pin into part of the family as he moves Pin in with him and his sister.  In Leon's mind, Pin is as much a part of the family as Mom, Dad, Ursula or himself.  As adults, Ursula has developed well, but Leon has serious mental problems, and has degenerated in his emotional and psychological development.When things begin to threaten Leon's and Pin's little world, Leon would always go to Pin for advice, much the same way a son would go to his father for advice.  After the death of his parents, Leon actually gives Pin even more of an identity by dressing him in clothes, giving him a wig and so on and so forth.  While Leon is unable to deal with reality, Ursula wishes to lead a normal life, and when she begins to date Stan, Leon and Pin take action, but not enough action to make this movie into a ""horror movie"" in my opinion!  In other words, ""Pin"", while somewhat stylish and imaginative, lacks in substance what ""Psycho"" clearly possesses.That being said, ""Pin"" is a nice little suspense flick that examines the darkness inside the unconscious mind.  In ""Pin"", there are some scary moments I guess you could say as Pin is somewhat creepy in his own right by his very existence and for what he represents in Leon's mind.  Leon is a very sick boy, and he seems to have a rather sick sense of poetry that is rather dark and depraved.  The plot in ""Pin"" is pretty good for a suspense movie, and the mainframe of a potential horror movie is present.  However, ""Pin"" fails to develop into the horror movie that it could have become.  There is clearly not enough violence and horror in ""Pin"" to call it a pure horror movie.  Leon, while somewhat creepy in all his craziness, is not a good nor a pure horror movie villain.  Unlike Norman Bates, Leon's prowess as a horror movie is insecure whereas Norman Bates proves his prowess as a horror movie several times in ""Psycho"".  While ""Pin"" seems to borrow some of psychological elements from ""Psycho"" and there are some parallels between Leon and Norman, Norman Bates is clearly much more dangerous than Leon as ""Psycho"" is clearly a horror movie in ever sense of the word whereas ""Pin"" seems to stall at the fork in the road at the point where it could go the horror movie route or play the suspense chiller.The acting in ""Pin"" is average to slightly above average, and this movie will keep you interested until the very end because you want to know what's going to happen to Leon and Pin.  However, ""Pin"" is the kind of movie that you probably want to watch just one time and does not hold up well to repeated viewings mainly because the action, horror and violence, which as a general rule and at least to some degree is necessary to the makings of a good horror movie, is simply not prevalent enough in this movie to make it into a good horror movie...while there are some exceptions to this general rule, ""Pin"" does not have enough atmosphere, style or substance to be considered one of them.",2,"1.75 STARS: ""Pin's the best friend you've ever had!!!"" -Leon",1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,4347,"['Pin', 'nice', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'not', 'true', 'horror', 'film', 'strict', 'sense', 'term', 'Basically', 'Pin', 'very', 'strange', 'family', 'much', 'ex-wife', 'family', 'lie', 'rate', 'father', 'physician', 'strange', 'family', 'have', 'difficulty', 'communicating', 'children', 'conventional', 'way', 'Therefore', 'alternate', 'entity', 'person', 'named', 'Pin', 'who', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'model', 'doctor', 'office', 'However', 'Pin', 'person', 'care', 'unenviable', 'tasks', 'talking', 'kids', 'sex', 'other', 'sensitive', 'issues', 'problem', 'here', 'psychological', 'development', 'children.While', 'Ursula', 'rather', 'nicely', 'maybe', 'too', 'active', 'libido', 'Leon', 'progress', 'development', 'fact', 'Leon', 'attached', 'obsessed', 'Pin', 'allow', 'idea', 'Pin', 'not', 'really', 'exist', 'enter', 'head', 'So', 'instead', 'dealing', 'reality', 'Leon', 'imaginary', 'world', 'Pin', 'sense', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'deviation', 'movie', 'Psycho', 'where', 'Leon', 'up', 'giving', 'half', 'life', 'Pin', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'gave', 'half', 'life', 'dead', 'mother', 'Obviously', 'Leon', 'suffers', 'severe', 'emotional', 'mental', 'distress', 'Ultimately', 'Leon', 'classic', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenic', 'parents', 'death', 'Leon', 'determined', 'make', 'Pin', 'part', 'family', 'Pin', 'sister', 'Leon', 'mind', 'Pin', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'family', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'Ursula', 'adults', 'Ursula', 'developed', 'well', 'Leon', 'serious', 'mental', 'problems', 'degenerated', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'development.When', 'things', 'begin', 'threaten', 'Leon', 'Pin', 'little', 'world', 'Leon', 'would', 'always', 'go', 'Pin', 'advice', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'son', 'would', 'go', 'father', 'advice', 'death', 'parents', 'Leon', 'actually', 'Pin', 'even', 'more', 'identity', 'dressing', 'clothes', 'giving', 'wig', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'Leon', 'unable', 'deal', 'reality', 'Ursula', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'when', 'date', 'Stan', 'Leon', 'Pin', 'take', 'action', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'make', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'opinion', 'other', 'words', 'Pin', 'somewhat', 'stylish', 'imaginative', 'lacks', 'substance', 'what', 'Psycho', 'clearly', 'being', 'said', 'Pin', 'nice', 'little', 'suspense', 'flick', 'darkness', 'unconscious', 'mind', 'Pin', 'are', 'scary', 'moments', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'Pin', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'own', 'right', 'very', 'existence', 'what', 'Leon', 'mind', 'Leon', 'very', 'sick', 'boy', 'have', 'rather', 'sick', 'sense', 'poetry', 'rather', 'dark', 'depraved', 'plot', 'Pin', 'pretty', 'good', 'suspense', 'movie', 'mainframe', 'potential', 'horror', 'movie', 'present', 'However', 'Pin', 'develop', 'horror', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'clearly', 'not', 'enough', 'violence', 'horror', 'Pin', 'call', 'pure', 'horror', 'movie', 'Leon', 'somewhat', 'craziness', 'not', 'good', 'pure', 'horror', 'movie', 'villain', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Leon', 'prowess', 'horror', 'movie', 'insecure', 'whereas', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'prowess', 'horror', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'Psycho', 'Pin', 'borrow', 'psychological', 'elements', 'Psycho', 'are', 'parallels', 'Leon', 'Norman', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'clearly', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Leon', 'Psycho', 'clearly', 'horror', 'movie', 'ever', 'sense', 'word', 'Pin', 'stall', 'fork', 'road', 'point', 'where', 'could', 'go', 'horror', 'movie', 'route', 'play', 'suspense', 'chiller.The', 'acting', 'Pin', 'average', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'interested', 'very', 'end', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Leon', 'Pin', 'However', 'Pin', 'kind', 'movie', 'probably', 'want', 'watch', 'just', 'one', 'time', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'mainly', 'action', 'horror', 'violence', 'general', 'rule', 'least', 'degree', 'necessary', 'makings', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'simply', 'not', 'prevalent', 'enough', 'movie', 'make', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'are', 'exceptions', 'general', 'rule', 'Pin', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'atmosphere', 'style', 'substance', 'be', 'considered', 'one']",Pin VHS

303770,A3HI2HBUS8MITB,6302247829,Patrick Hall,"[1, 1]","PINPIN is one of those psychological horror thrillers that rely heavily on suspense and peculiarities to create a mood of discomfort and interest.  It's the total opposite of your typical gore-fest film of the 80s, and fans of the genre that are expecting lots of blood and murder probably won't like it much.  Yet, you'll find the movie provides a somewhat discomforting feeling through other means, and this amplifies the effectiveness because it seems so much more real.The focus of the film is on a small family, the image of perfection.  The father is a doctor.  Mother is a fastidious housekeeper.  They have an extroverted, outgoing daughter, and a shy, introspective son.  PIN is the 5th member of the family, an anatomically accurate dummy that dad uses in a bizarre ventriloquism act to both make his young patience at ease, and to explain difficult subjects to them.  And so, PIN develops his own persona with the children, but it is the son, Leon, who really starts to see PIN as a living, thinking being, an actual member of the family.It becomes clear that Leon's mental health is not all that great, and that the perfect family life shows some seriously repressive behavior.  Life for Leon is particularly lonely, and he soon begins to rely more on more on PIN to help him through his struggles.  PIN becomes Leon's only friend.The film goes on to examine the family structure, and with the demise of the parents, the relationship between Leon and his sister Ursula.  As Leon's mind degenerates, PIN becomes an increasingly important part of Leon's ego, to the point that Leon actually becomes more PIN than himself.  These scenes with PIN are somewhat amusing as Leon increasing treats him as a living member of the family, dressing him up, reserving a spot at the dinner table, even going so far as to enacting a sexual encounter for the dummy.  Trust me, you don't want to miss that scene.In a lot of ways, the story resembles Psycho.  Both protagonists are timid, intelligent, lonely figures.  Both had dominating mothers, and both have extremely repressed sexual urges that begin to manifest themselves in strange ways.  Like Norman Bates used his dead mother, Leon uses PIN in times of anxiety as a stress reliever, a conduit in which to act out things he never could as Leon.  But unlike Norman Bates, Leon seems to draw out our sympathies.  We both fear and fear for him, at times despising him, and at other times relating to him.It's a complex movie, and the creepy factor might turn a lot of people off of it.  It is very deliberate in it's buildup, and it's lack of action or violence might further alienate some viewers, but it's a really well thought out movie, perfectly acted, and definitely worth seeing.",4,The love bewteen a boy and his anatomically correct doll,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,2736,"['PINPIN', 'one', 'psychological', 'horror', 'thrillers', 'rely', 'heavily', 'suspense', 'peculiarities', 'create', 'mood', 'discomfort', 'interest', 'total', 'opposite', 'typical', 'gore-fest', 'film', '80s', 'fans', 'genre', 'are', 'expecting', 'lots', 'blood', 'murder', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', ""'ll"", 'find', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'discomforting', 'feeling', 'other', 'means', 'effectiveness', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'real.The', 'focus', 'film', 'small', 'family', 'image', 'perfection', 'father', 'doctor', 'Mother', 'fastidious', 'housekeeper', 'have', 'extroverted', 'outgoing', 'daughter', 'shy', 'introspective', 'son', 'PIN', '5th', 'member', 'family', 'anatomically', 'accurate', 'dummy', 'bizarre', 'ventriloquism', 'act', 'make', 'young', 'patience', 'ease', 'explain', 'difficult', 'subjects', 'so', 'PIN', 'own', 'persona', 'children', 'son', 'Leon', 'who', 'really', 'see', 'PIN', 'living', 'thinking', 'being', 'actual', 'member', 'family.It', 'becomes', 'clear', 'Leon', 'mental', 'health', 'not', 'great', 'perfect', 'family', 'life', 'seriously', 'repressive', 'behavior', 'Life', 'Leon', 'particularly', 'lonely', 'soon', 'rely', 'more', 'more', 'PIN', 'help', 'struggles', 'PIN', 'Leon', 'only', 'friend.The', 'film', 'examine', 'family', 'structure', 'demise', 'parents', 'relationship', 'Leon', 'sister', 'Ursula', 'Leon', 'mind', 'degenerates', 'PIN', 'increasingly', 'important', 'part', 'Leon', 'ego', 'point', 'Leon', 'actually', 'more', 'PIN', 'scenes', 'PIN', 'are', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'Leon', 'increasing', 'treats', 'living', 'member', 'family', 'dressing', 'up', 'reserving', 'spot', 'dinner', 'table', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'enacting', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'dummy', 'Trust', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'lot', 'ways', 'story', 'Psycho', 'protagonists', 'are', 'timid', 'intelligent', 'lonely', 'figures', 'had', 'dominating', 'mothers', 'have', 'extremely', 'repressed', 'sexual', 'urges', 'begin', 'manifest', 'strange', 'ways', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'used', 'dead', 'mother', 'Leon', 'PIN', 'times', 'anxiety', 'stress', 'reliever', 'conduit', 'act', 'out', 'things', 'never', 'could', 'Leon', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Leon', 'draw', 'out', 'sympathies', 'fear', 'fear', 'times', 'despising', 'other', 'times', 'relating', 'him.It', 'complex', 'movie', 'creepy', 'factor', 'might', 'turn', 'lot', 'people', 'very', 'deliberate', 'buildup', 'lack', 'action', 'violence', 'might', 'further', 'alienate', 'viewers', 'really', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",Pin VHS

Leon (David Hewlett) and Ursula (Cyndy Preston) are neat, polite and good natured. They are also overprotected, and Leon is painfully nave.Dr. Linden is a stern yet loving father who often uses a bit of amateur ventriloquism with an anatomical dummy to explain complex or possibly embarrassing medical facts to his young patients. Mrs. Linden is house-proud and high strung. In other words, these are fairly typical, affluent parents doing all they can to bring up their children with decent values.Sound familiar? Good. Because one of the things that makes this portrait of a nut case interesting is the absence of clich&eacute;s about how such people are made. If you're like me, you're sick of hearing how badly little Norman/Hannibal/Michael was treated as a child. It makes perfect sense that a vulnerable, odd kid exposed to brutality could turn out to be a monster. But how many films (aside from Serial Mom and Parents) set out to examine the crazy-making aspects of good old American suburbia?On the surface, Leon is what most parents want their kids to be. He works hard and makes decent grades. He behaves nicely in public. He even dresses well (in suits and cardigans) and keeps his room clean. Oh, and he talks to his father's anatomical dummy, named Pin (short for Pinocchio). Leon asks Pin for advice, and feels they have a very close relationship.Uh-huh.This 1988 film contains a few fashion and styling horrors (shoulder pads galore). Otherwise, it is surprisingly good. The camera work is expert. The acting is understated and effective.The script doesn't rely on a lot of exposition to set up what is--after all--largely inexplicable. How can parents prevent their children from becoming crazies, when so many predilections come from experiences that can't be anticipated? It is the strange combination of Leon's innocence and the way in which key moments in his life involve a seemingly harmless object, that creates his aberrant point of view. Leon merely endows Pin with the wisdom of his father and a tolerance or kindness that both his parents lack.Leon's sister Ursula tries to understand. But the more time she spends in the real world outside their house, the more she comes to realize that Leon's behavior is bizarre. The tragic consequences of Leon's creepy obsession are unavoidable, but they make sense in a way that horror story arcs seldom do.Keep your Baby Orphan Hannibal.
