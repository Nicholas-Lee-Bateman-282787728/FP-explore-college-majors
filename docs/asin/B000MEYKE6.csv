1045805,AJ7PN0MNUEXCL,B000MEYKE6,"A guy loving talented guys ""Chaka Cenk""","[0, 0]","On a binge of horror movies, I saw four this week and this is the best.I guess those reviewers who gave this flick one star have misunderstood it. They easily bumped it into the category of slasher movies. While it apparently seems to be a slasher, it rises above that sub-genre gracefully, turning into a psychological struggle of wills of the hunter and the hunted, the cat and mouse. Cujo is a good reference point: The mother and the dog are replaced by Penny and the hitchhiker. The hitchiker tries to disintegrate Penny, and Penny, while annoyingly whinny and incompetent early, grows for the better, ultimately gathering necessary wools to stand up and save her life.The ending is probably a letdown, leaving it open to interpretation but the good scenes are those clausthobhic ones in the car. I recommend this to spend a nice Saturday night. I sometimes shouted at Penny's studipity but I guess the movie has succeeded in manipulating me.Anyway, what I hated in the movie was the Hollywood stupidities and cliches. Let me count.1. How come all drivers never look ahead on their way when driving a car and it is just at that time that a hitchiker/ a cow/ a man stands in the middle of the road? (Slash, another movie of the week, had a very similar scene (hitchiker replaced by cow and of course led to the annihilation of two young people by the slasher)2. How come all drivers admit a hitchiker on a dark slice of road in the middle of nowhere with no traffic around after sunset and why do they accept to take him/ her to a destination which is accessible on a narrowly larged than footpath through a densely populated forest?2. How come two young and unprotected ladies travel towards the peak of very formidable looking mountains, braving into a snowstorm in a small family car without even checking the spare tire, let alone, other equipment that would be handy at such locations, or a boyfriend, male assistant or a bigger and stronger car?3. How come all the destination points turn out to be ""no-signal"" zones in this age of technology and aerospace? Why do protagonists never try to send an SMS, which can be sometimes received by the recipient phone even without any signal to talk (and in Penny Dreadful there were moments of mild signals that could quite easily transmit a SMS that seeks help).4. How come all side or outside characters are there just to get killed as soon as they appear? (Yes, I am looking at you, the cook in the Shining, who travelled thousands of miles just to get axed as soon as he arrived in the hotel)?5. How come those killers, while they are also flesh and blood, refuse to die at any cost while the victims say goodbye to this earth in the very first slash of knife?The beginning and the end of this movie is almost a Cliche 101 course in this respect but as I said the middle is very worth to see it.",3,The best movie of the week.,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,2851,"['binge', 'horror', 'movies', 'saw', 'four', 'week', 'best.I', 'guess', 'reviewers', 'who', 'gave', 'flick', 'one', 'star', 'have', 'misunderstood', 'easily', 'bumped', 'category', 'slasher', 'movies', 'apparently', 'be', 'slasher', 'sub-genre', 'gracefully', 'turning', 'psychological', 'struggle', 'wills', 'hunter', 'hunted', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Cujo', 'good', 'reference', 'point', 'mother', 'dog', 'are', 'replaced', 'Penny', 'hitchhiker', 'hitchiker', 'disintegrate', 'Penny', 'Penny', 'annoyingly', 'whinny', 'incompetent', 'early', 'better', 'ultimately', 'gathering', 'necessary', 'wools', 'stand', 'up', 'save', 'life.The', 'ending', 'probably', 'letdown', 'leaving', 'open', 'interpretation', 'good', 'scenes', 'are', 'clausthobhic', 'ones', 'car', 'recommend', 'spend', 'nice', 'Saturday', 'night', 'sometimes', 'shouted', 'Penny', 'studipity', 'guess', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'manipulating', 'me.Anyway', 'what', 'hated', 'movie', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'stupidities', 'cliches', 'Let', 'count.1', 'How', 'come', 'drivers', 'never', 'look', 'ahead', 'way', 'when', 'driving', 'car', 'just', 'time', 'hitchiker/', 'cow/', 'man', 'middle', 'road', 'Slash', 'movie', 'week', 'had', 'very', 'similar', 'scene', 'hitchiker', 'replaced', 'cow', 'course', 'led', 'annihilation', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'slasher', '2', 'How', 'come', 'drivers', 'admit', 'hitchiker', 'dark', 'slice', 'road', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'traffic', 'around', 'sunset', 'why', 'do', 'accept', 'take', 'him/', 'destination', 'accessible', 'narrowly', 'larged', 'footpath', 'densely', 'populated', 'forest', '2', 'How', 'come', 'two', 'young', 'unprotected', 'ladies', 'travel', 'peak', 'very', 'formidable', 'looking', 'mountains', 'braving', 'snowstorm', 'small', 'family', 'car', 'even', 'checking', 'spare', 'tire', 'let', 'alone', 'other', 'equipment', 'would', 'be', 'handy', 'such', 'locations', 'boyfriend', 'male', 'assistant', 'bigger', 'stronger', 'car', '3', 'How', 'come', 'destination', 'points', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'no-signal', 'zones', 'age', 'technology', 'aerospace', 'Why', 'do', 'protagonists', 'never', 'try', 'send', 'SMS', 'can', 'be', 'sometimes', 'received', 'recipient', 'phone', 'even', 'signal', 'talk', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'were', 'moments', 'mild', 'signals', 'could', 'quite', 'easily', 'transmit', 'SMS', 'help', '.4', 'How', 'come', 'side', 'outside', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'get', 'killed', 'as', 'soon', 'appear', 'Yes', 'am', 'looking', 'cook', 'Shining', 'who', 'travelled', 'thousands', 'miles', 'just', 'get', 'axed', 'as', 'soon', 'arrived', 'hotel', '5', 'How', 'come', 'killers', 'are', 'also', 'flesh', 'blood', 'refuse', 'die', 'cost', 'victims', 'say', 'goodbye', 'earth', 'very', 'first', 'slash', 'knife', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'almost', 'Cliche', '101', 'course', 'respect', 'said', 'middle', 'very', 'worth', 'see']",Penny Dreadful

Way too much time was spent with the crying, whining, mucous dripping girl in the car, withougt enough time beind spent on the killer or the other murders or victims. I know the crux of the movie raveled around the girls fear of cars, but this just only held my interest because this was the first, and likely the last time I saw this movie. I got tired of looking at Mimi Rogers dead body. Once a victim in a slasher flick has entered  the happy or unhappy hereafter, they should only enjoy a minute or so more of screentime. Every movie must carry the audiance from scene to scene, right up to the end. This one did not. When the audiance of a slasher flick starts rooting for the killer, instead of the victim, somehting is wrong with the movie. My sympathy for the victim wained slowly.

1045807,A3FNQG7QWNP0RC,B000MEYKE6,Bob the Skull,"[1, 2]","Rarely have I come across a movie whose title is so apt.  Had I not watched this via Amazon Prime, I would have been returning the movie immediately.PD follows the story of young girl who took a joy ride in Christine with her mom and dad, and now suffers from crippling trauma because she watched her parents die in front of her eyes.  Years on, she's making the journey again - because the first go-round was so jolly - driven by the world's worst therapist.  You know how the stereotypical Horror movie has you calling out advice to the characters (like, ""stop being such morons!"")?  Well, in this movie, you'll be yelling advice at the therapist if you're anything like me; probably telling her to stop being such rubbish.  At any rate, the travelling duo manage to hit and pick up Hannibal Lecter (not really)  who's hungry and eats the therapist (I wish), and decides to do what any rational serial killer would do: find four conveniently placed trees, and trap  Ms. Damaged-Goods between them in the car.  What follows is an emotionally draining experience, as you lose all sense of connection with the ineffective twit.I know that the whole point of this exercise is to trap the girl in her worst nightmare and watch what happens; but honestly, the magnifier-to-an-anthill method of plot development only works if you feel some sort of vestment in the ants' survival - and you won't.  Perhaps it's the inept script; or maybe the simple fact that this girl seems to have the self-preservation instincts of a lemming; but any sympathies you may have had going in will swiftly vanish.There are more characters introdced - they're even worse than the first, if you can believe that - but I don't know much about their intended roles because I stopped watching due to something else coming up - for which I was ever so thankful.  And I think that tells you everything you need to know in that one sentiment: I was pleased to be pulled away fron a movie.Given my comments, I can't recommend this movie unless you have a lovely, shiny Prime membership pass to watch it for free.  And even if you do have said membership, you could better spend your time by shutting your head in a car door.",1,"More appropriately, just plain ""Dreadful"".",1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,2190,"['Rarely', 'have', 'come', 'movie', 'title', 'so', 'apt', 'Had', 'not', 'watched', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'returning', 'movie', 'immediately.PD', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'took', 'joy', 'ride', 'Christine', 'mom', 'dad', 'now', 'suffers', 'crippling', 'trauma', 'watched', 'parents', 'die', 'front', 'eyes', 'Years', 'making', 'journey', 'again', 'first', 'go-round', 'was', 'so', 'jolly', 'driven', 'world', 'worst', 'therapist', 'know', 'how', 'stereotypical', 'Horror', 'movie', 'calling', 'out', 'advice', 'characters', 'stop', 'being', 'such', 'morons', 'Well', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'yelling', 'advice', 'therapist', ""'re"", 'anything', 'probably', 'telling', 'stop', 'being', 'such', 'rubbish', 'rate', 'travelling', 'duo', 'manage', 'hit', 'pick', 'up', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'not', 'really', 'who', 'hungry', 'therapist', 'wish', 'decides', 'do', 'what', 'rational', 'serial', 'killer', 'would', 'do', 'find', 'four', 'conveniently', 'placed', 'trees', 'Ms.', 'Damaged-Goods', 'car', 'What', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'experience', 'lose', 'sense', 'connection', 'ineffective', 'twit.I', 'know', 'whole', 'point', 'exercise', 'trap', 'girl', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'watch', 'what', 'honestly', 'magnifier-to-an-anthill', 'method', 'plot', 'development', 'only', 'feel', 'sort', 'vestment', 'ants', 'survival', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Perhaps', 'inept', 'script', 'maybe', 'simple', 'fact', 'girl', 'have', 'self-preservation', 'instincts', 'lemming', 'sympathies', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'going', 'will', 'swiftly', 'are', 'more', 'characters', 'introdced', ""'re"", 'even', 'worse', 'first', 'can', 'believe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'intended', 'roles', 'stopped', 'watching', 'due', 'something', 'else', 'coming', 'up', 'was', 'ever', 'so', 'thankful', 'think', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'one', 'sentiment', 'was', 'pleased', 'be', 'pulled', 'away', 'movie.Given', 'comments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'have', 'lovely', 'shiny', 'Prime', 'membership', 'pass', 'watch', 'free', 'even', 'do', 'have', 'said', 'membership', 'could', 'better', 'spend', 'time', 'shutting', 'head', 'car', 'door']",Penny Dreadful
1045808,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B000MEYKE6,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[2, 3]","Like one review said, the movie's biggest fault is that it's too long & there's some characters that could have been cut (pun intended) from the movie.The premise of the movie is an interesting one- you have the main character Penny who is traveling into the mountains with her psychiatrist Orianna as part of a therapy session. You see, Penny's parents died in a horrible car accident & as a result she's incapable of getting into a car without having a panic attack with fits of nausea. Unfortunately for them they ran into a hitchhiker who has his/her (never quite clear on the gender) own idea of a good time. As in cutting people open for fun.This really wasn't my type of horror movie but I decided to give it a try based on the premise & the title. (I've always loved the term 'Penny Dreadful'.) While the movie is overly long & could have been better served as an hour long production, it's still a pretty good slasher flick. There's some interesting imagery in the film for those who are looking for a little hidden depth to their horror films. (You can equate Penny's climb out of the car as akin to her climbing out of a womb, showing that she's not afraid of cars anymore. Before that point she was only going to hide in the car.)(Caution, some spoilers ahead!)I couldn't help but feel a little bit disappointed overall, though. There was the potential for a twist in the movie, a twist that never really came.  At one point I almost thought that the hitchhiker was actually Penny herself & that she had killed everyone in a state of delirium after having snapped from revisiting the mountains where her parents died. (The hitchhiker representing her autophobia.) I also imagined that there could be a possibility that there was someone else in the car with Penny & her parents before the crash & that the hitchhiker was actually her long lost brother that she'd suppressed memories of. (Like for instance he could have been ejected from the car where no one found him & he grew up living in the wild. Then he chose to take revenge on Penny when he read her dossier in the car b/c he viewed her as forgetting him.) None of these twists ever came however & the film ends with the stereotypical ""bad guy might get up to kill again"" finale.Still, for fans of the slasher genre this will be a nice flick. Worth owning? Dunno- it was interesting to watch once, but that really seemed to be enough for me. There really wasn't anything extraordinary about the film that seemed to stand out. The main actress was amazing in this role, especially considering that she literally carried the bulk of the film. Then again, I'm not the target audience so it may appeal to slasher fans.

The young woman must overcome her fears and fight against the killer's ""games"" in order to survive. Rachel Miner is an underrated actress, and her skills are utilized well here; she carries the film for the most part. This is her second notable performance in a very dramatic and demanding role (""Bully"" was her best performance), so by casting a quality lead actress it adds to the film greatly. The plot and suspense is not quite on par with, say, Steven King's work, nor is it as tense throughout as ""Blair Witch.""

1045812,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000MEYKE6,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Putting the word ""dreadful"" in your title is really just asking for trouble, while this film's title as a whole carries with it the connotation of cheap, dragged out thrills.  Fortunately, this film rises above those potential handicaps and - notwithstanding an overreliance on clich&eacute; and a truly disappointing ending - strings several good scenes together into a somewhat effective dark thriller.  It's still far too predictable in parts to truly impress, but it's not a bad way to spend ninety minutes if you're the kind of person who enjoys watching someone put through the physical and emotional ringer - and, yes, I am that type of person.  I didn't hold out a lot of hope early on, as the main character was as annoying as she was sympathetic, but Rachel Miner's performance got better and better as the story progressed - under conditions that were by no means easy.The success or failure of this film depended solely on Miner's performance, as the plot is pretty straightforward.  Our young Penny is trying to conquer her terrible fear of automobiles.  It sounds silly on the face of it, but Penny's fear was borne in the wake of an automobile accident that injured her and killed her parents when she was only a child.  Her therapist, Orianna Volkes (Mimi Rogers), puts her ""Full Circle"" technique to work by driving the terrified young lady back to the spot where the tragic accident occurred - in the densely wooded mountains, at night, with a snowstorm on the way.  It doesn't sound like a good idea to me to begin with, but things go from bad to worse when Orianna hits a hitchhiker in the middle of the road.  Nothing good could possibly come from that.The majority of the film takes place inside of the car, where Penny finds herself trapped alongside a most uncommunicative companion and mentally - and, in time physically - tortured by a homicidal maniac.  With the car wedged in between several trees, Penny is pretty much helpless - not to mention terrified.  Frankly, I can't blame her as she keeps popping the sedatives she brought along on this little adventure.  Those pills are really a key ingredient to the plot, making the viewer question how much of the story is real.

Rachel Miner plays Penny Deerborn who, after witnessing both parents die in a horrible car accident, takes a trip with her psychoanalyst, Dr. Orianna Volkes, (played by Mimi Rogers) to Big Bear to overcome her deep-bred fear of automobiles.  The name for that ""phobia"" escapes me, but it is a more common phobia than is ever talked about.  Penny cannot stand cars:  she does not want to ride in them and she certainly does not want to ride in them for any length of time.On their way to their destination, the good doctor demonstrates she's not the best driver in the world when she just about runs over a rather ominous hitchhiker.  In lieu of a huge lawsuit (and this is about the only reasoning I can think of for this pattern of movie logic), the good doctor then decides to give their victim, er, hitcher a ride to Camp-Way-Out-In-the-Woods-Where-Nobody-Would-Ever-Visit-and-Has-Been-Closed-for-the-Past-Two-Months.  If that isn't bad enough, the hitcher then offers them a bit of human shishkebob--and no one bats an eye.  In fact, Penny feels the need to ""open up,"" so she proceeds to tell the stranger all about her phobia.  Big mistake.I'll stop there because I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who might want to purchase or rent it for their viewing pleasure.  The look of the movie is great; not only did I get cold while watching, but there were many times when I had to ""remember to breathe.""  Rachel Miner does a good job at displaying her phobia, as well as another one who many of us have:  claustrophobia.  There are times while she was in that car that I literally had to set up in bed and get my breath.  Mimi Rogers does a great job of playing a corpse.  Liz Davies plays the hitchhiker with great panache; however, her voice sounded very masculine so I was fooled when I found out the killer was female.**SPOILER ALERT**  Why such a low rating frome me?  First of all, I keep rating these movies (and CDs) low in hopes that Amazon will re-think their ratings and start assigning ""1/2""-stars.  I would have given this movie 2-1/2 stars.  It was better than a ""2;"" not as good as a ""3.""  What bothered me most about this movie was there was no payoff.  If I have to sit through 92 minutes of ANY scary movie listening to some person--male or female--snort, snot, and cry for the majority of that movie, then I expect a payoff; and, NO, it doesn't always have to be boilerplate payoff.  Growing up around women who would have kicked the protagonist's butt pretty quickly, I had trouble in really feeling for the victim.  I just wanted to scream, ""Grow yourself a sac and do SOMETHING.""  For this movie to wear me out the way it did, the ending was a complete let down.The movie was directed by Richard Brandes, who also helped on the screenplay.  It is rated R for some gore (nothing over-the-top) and for one really lame excuse for a love scene.

It gives us all a chance to see some new films. Also helps filmmakers get their movies released so it is a great idea. When the first batch was released this was one of the films included in that first eight. When this first was released I was interested in this one because of the story laid out on the back of the box.Penny Deerborn [Rachel Miner] is a young woman that is terrified of cars, why one would ask? Well that is because when she was a little girl she was involved in a car accident that took both of her parents lives. She has sense tried to get help and help has come in the form of Dr. Orianna Volkes [Mimi Rogers]. They are taking a road trip together in the hopes that she will overcome her fear.While on the road they come across a hitchhiker whom they hit, in doing so after seeing that the person is alright they offer said person a ride. The hitchhiker is a very quite one and after being dropped off ruins their tire. After realizing this the good Doctor goes off to try and find phone reception some where. Things get worse as she does not return and Penny must hide inside the thing she is terrified off as the hitchhiker torments her from the outside.This film is actually a pretty enjoyable little tale and it is cool she must hide out in the car. The film is a tense one but not overly scary although the idea sure is. The performances here are good and believable. The hitchhiker is scary enough and the situation makes for an entertaining film. The best thing about this film is that it is more of a psychological horror film. Penny is terrorized while trapped in the car, hence what she feared now is keeping her safe, some therapy.The writers and director did a good job here with this film. I wouldn't say it is a classic but that depends on taste. It is definitely a good horror flick for a nice dark night at home on the coach. While not my favorite form the first string of the ""8 films to die for"" it is one of the better ones.

1045823,A294KYD3RF4WAL,B000MEYKE6,"John Upton ""fiction-fiend""","[39, 45]","""Penny Dreadful"" is one of the 8 After Dark Horrorfest films that saw theatrical release over the course of one weekend in 2006. I considered going to the movies to see a few of the films but figured the DVD's would probably cost me less than the fare of a movie ticket (I was right based on the sale price the week they were released). Besides, I can deal with disappointment watching a bad movie on disc than seeing one in the movies.I'm a big fan of horror movies and can be pretty lenient in my opinion of them as long as they aren't a complete disaster. (See my review of ""The Beast of Bray Road""The Beast Of Bray Roadfor an example of complete disaster. ""Penny Dreadful"" falls somewhere in the half way point.The film focuses on Penny Deerborn (Rachel Miner) who is terrified of automobiles after a tragic accident when she was young took the lives of her parents. Penny is embarking upon a road trip with Dr. Orianna Volkes (Mimi Rogers), a psychiatrist trying to help rid Penny of her amaxophobia. During the trip, the two cross paths with a hitchhiker. This, of course, is the point in all horror films when everything goes to hell.I'll start by saying that the hitchhiker is a very creepy character and there are scenes of great tension in the movie. I enjoyed the idea of the car, a source of terror for the character, having to serve as a refuge. The biggest flaw with the film is it's too long (92 minutes). Instead of being released as a feature film it should have been part of Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" series. There are a few side characters introduced in the film who serve no real function but to be potential victims. They could have been cut from the film without even being missed.I also thought the movie ended a bit suddenly. I don't need movies to be wrapped up nicely in a little bow but a person wants some sense of closure.

1045826,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000MEYKE6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 8]","Actually, I thought ""Penny Dreadful"" was the most innovative film from the After Dark Horrorfest and certainly not the worst (that would be ""The Hamiltons,"" hands down).  I went the whole route with the ""8 Films 2 Die 4,"" catching all eight films at their first showings each day, buying my tickets in advance to get the free t-shirt, and then waiting for the monster it depicted to show up in one of the films (it never happened).  In between the films while we got our free pop refills (I recommend just getting your large drink filled up halfway so you can make it all the way through the movie), we would sit around and dissect each film and make recommendations (""Audition"" was the film most mentioned).  At the end the festival my impromptu straw poll found that ""Penny Dreadful"" had as much support as any other film for the ""best of show"" title that would earn one of the eight a general release.  We thought they would go with ""Dark Ride"" as the most commercially viable of the bunch, but they ended up picking ""The Abandoned,"" which had its own uniqueness in that the heroine is a mature woman twice the age of the title character in this film.This was the third movie on the second day and I should explain that we had a running gag going regarding the connection between women and cars established in these films.  The first day ended with ""Dark Ride,"" which involved the heroine driving a mini-van through a wall at the right time and at the right place to save the day.  The second day started with ""The Gravedancers,"" in which the same thing happened (I think it was an SUV that time).  That was followed by ""The Abandoned,"" which begins and ends with a woman driving a giant farm truck.  So by the time ""Penny Dreadful"" started we were all chuckling at the fact the characters were in such a small vehicle because it was just a standard car.The car in question is being driven by Orianna Volker (Mimi Rogers of ""Ginger Snaps""), a psychologist who is trying to get Penny Dearborn (Rachel Miner of ""The Guiding Light"") over her phobia of cars.  We will find out via flashbacks that she was in a car accident that claimed the lives of her parents, so she has good reason to be traumatized by the experience and want to avoid driving around in a car again.  But Orianna is taking Penny on a road trip to help her get over her phobia.  Penny has to stop at every gas station along the way so she can puke up her guts and then things get worse.  When Orianna clips a pedestrian on a lonely stretch of mountain road she figures the least she can do is give the guy a ride.  The fact that his face is obscured by a hood and that he has a skewer of meat with him does not set off the alarm bells for Orianna that are telling the rest of us that this was a big mistake (have you seen the commercial where the guy picks up the hitchhiker with the ax because the guy is carrying Bud Light and claims it is just a can opener?).Now you know full well that given this setup that Orianna is going to be dead and Penny is going to have to face the hitchhiker.  What you do not expect is that most of the film is going to take place IN that little car (do not ask how the maniac set up this scenario, just go with it).  At that point you will be thinking that there is not that much you can do given this scenario, but I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  Director Richard Brandes (""Out for Blood"") co-wrote the screenplay with Diane Doniol-Valcroze (""Kill by Inches"").  There are not a lot of horror films that come up with such a simple scenario and then stick to it (I always think of Stephen King's short story ""Survivor Type"" and novel ""Gerald's Game"" as examples of the one note take to extreme approach).  Yes, the initial requisite bad decision is compounded by a series of other fatal errors (I believe I actually said ""Drive on the rims"" out loud in the theater), but fortunately this 2006 horror film relies more on Penny's phobia and the specific situation to play out the story.Given Penny's phobia I bet you think you know exactly how this movie has got to end, but the ending for this movie does not go for the obvious.  Again, this speaks to the determination of Brandes to go against expectations and to come up with something different.  I certainly appreciated the audacity of doing a slasher film where most of the action is set in and around a car stuck in the woods.  The net result is not a great horror film, and if your taste runs to the extreme gore of films like ""Saw III,"" ""Wolf Creek,"" ""Hostel,"" et al., then this one is going to seem dreadfully tame.  But I was pleasantly surprised and hopefully most of you who decide to check out ""Penny Dreadful"" on DVD will feel the same.",4,The After Dark Horrorfest film with the most original situation,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,4710,"['Actually', 'thought', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'was', 'most', 'innovative', 'film', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst', 'would', 'be', 'Hamiltons', 'down', 'went', 'whole', 'route', '8', 'Films', '2', 'Die', '4', 'catching', 'eight', 'films', 'first', 'showings', 'day', 'buying', 'tickets', 'advance', 'get', 'free', 't-shirt', 'then', 'waiting', 'monster', 'depicted', 'show', 'up', 'one', 'films', 'never', 'happened', 'films', 'got', 'free', 'pop', 'refills', 'recommend', 'just', 'getting', 'large', 'drink', 'filled', 'up', 'halfway', 'can', 'make', 'way', 'movie', 'would', 'sit', 'dissect', 'film', 'make', 'recommendations', 'Audition', 'was', 'film', 'most', 'mentioned', 'end', 'festival', 'impromptu', 'straw', 'poll', 'found', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'had', 'much', 'support', 'other', 'film', 'best', 'show', 'title', 'would', 'earn', 'one', 'eight', 'general', 'release', 'thought', 'would', 'go', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'most', 'commercially', 'viable', 'bunch', 'ended', 'up', 'picking', 'Abandoned', 'had', 'own', 'uniqueness', 'heroine', 'mature', 'woman', 'twice', 'age', 'title', 'character', 'film.This', 'was', 'third', 'movie', 'second', 'day', 'should', 'explain', 'had', 'running', 'gag', 'going', 'regarding', 'connection', 'women', 'cars', 'established', 'films', 'first', 'day', 'ended', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'involved', 'heroine', 'driving', 'mini-van', 'wall', 'right', 'time', 'right', 'place', 'save', 'day', 'second', 'day', 'started', 'Gravedancers', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'think', 'was', 'SUV', 'time', 'was', 'followed', 'Abandoned', 'woman', 'driving', 'giant', 'farm', 'truck', 'So', 'time', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'started', 'were', 'chuckling', 'fact', 'characters', 'were', 'such', 'small', 'vehicle', 'was', 'just', 'standard', 'car.The', 'car', 'question', 'being', 'driven', 'Orianna', 'Volker', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'Ginger', 'Snaps', 'psychologist', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'Penny', 'Dearborn', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'Guiding', 'Light', 'phobia', 'cars', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'car', 'accident', 'claimed', 'lives', 'parents', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'traumatized', 'experience', 'want', 'avoid', 'driving', 'around', 'car', 'again', 'Orianna', 'taking', 'Penny', 'road', 'trip', 'help', 'get', 'phobia', 'Penny', 'stop', 'gas', 'station', 'way', 'can', 'puke', 'up', 'guts', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'When', 'Orianna', 'pedestrian', 'lonely', 'stretch', 'mountain', 'road', 'least', 'can', 'do', 'give', 'guy', 'ride', 'fact', 'face', 'obscured', 'hood', 'skewer', 'meat', 'not', 'set', 'off', 'alarm', 'bells', 'Orianna', 'are', 'telling', 'rest', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'have', 'seen', 'commercial', 'where', 'guy', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'ax', 'guy', 'carrying', 'Bud', 'Light', 'claims', 'just', 'can', 'opener', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'given', 'setup', 'Orianna', 'going', 'be', 'dead', 'Penny', 'going', 'have', 'face', 'hitchhiker', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'most', 'film', 'going', 'take', 'place', 'IN', 'little', 'car', 'do', 'not', 'ask', 'how', 'maniac', 'set', 'up', 'scenario', 'just', 'go', 'point', 'will', 'be', 'thinking', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'given', 'scenario', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Brandes', 'Out', 'Blood', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Diane', 'Doniol-Valcroze', 'Kill', 'Inches', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'horror', 'films', 'come', 'up', 'simple', 'scenario', 'then', 'stick', 'always', 'think', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'Survivor', 'Type', 'novel', 'Gerald', 'Game', 'examples', 'one', 'note', 'take', 'extreme', 'approach', 'Yes', 'initial', 'requisite', 'bad', 'decision', 'compounded', 'series', 'other', 'fatal', 'errors', 'believe', 'actually', 'said', 'Drive', 'rims', 'out', 'loud', 'theater', 'fortunately', '2006', 'horror', 'film', 'relies', 'more', 'Penny', 'phobia', 'specific', 'situation', 'play', 'out', 'story.Given', 'Penny', 'phobia', 'bet', 'think', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'end', 'ending', 'movie', 'not', 'go', 'obvious', 'Again', 'determination', 'Brandes', 'go', 'expectations', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'different', 'certainly', 'appreciated', 'audacity', 'doing', 'slasher', 'film', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'set', 'car', 'stuck', 'woods', 'net', 'result', 'not', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'taste', 'extreme', 'gore', 'films', 'Saw', 'III', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'Hostel', 'al.', 'then', 'one', 'going', 'seem', 'dreadfully', 'tame', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'hopefully', 'most', 'who', 'decide', 'check', 'out', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'DVD', 'will', 'feel', 'same']",Penny Dreadful

Weems ""emperor_weems""","[6, 9]","Courtney Solomon, director of the HorrorFest, said that the event was put together hastily in 3 months, which may excuse mildly the general quality of these films--unfortunately, Solomon threw in a suggestion that he will have a full year for the next one (plug, plug).  Even though I still insist that I am going to get through the full 8 out of DVD, having missed the theatrical runs of these movies, I must admit that I'm not looking forward to the rest so much.  The main benefit so far has been that most of these flicks have run around 90 minutes, so the effort hasn't been too much of a commitment of my time.But I love horror movies, so I continue to have some hope.My main disappointment with this series so far is what this film holds in spades--many of these horror films have absolutely hackneyed and cliche moves of horror movies, but really do nothing to show any awareness of this triteness.  Am I expecting every horror film made nowadays to be likeScream, where the elements of horror movies are actually discussed in the plot?  Certainly not.  Even that movie played out that element to redundant extremes.But I can hope that modern horror movies can at least work under the paradigm that there are other horror movies in the world and don't expect an audience to be so ignorant that the same-ol' same-ol' will work each and every time.In other words...I want originality.  At least a little.But this film disappoints in many ways, most of all in that it may have had an actual germ of an interesting movie, which got bastardized into trite junk.The plot is simple--Penny was traumatized from a car accident in her youth, and with the help with her therapist (Mimi Rogers, who I think did some of her best durn stuff inGinger Snaps), is trying to overcome her fear of automobiles by riding to the place where her traumatizing accident took place.Now what?  A mysterious stranger?  Penny forced to face her fears while fending off a mysterious killer?  You bet.  Even spot appearances by Michael Berryman (the representative face of the classicThe Hills Have Eyes) and Mickey Jones, who has made a career out of playing rednecks and bikers, can't help this plot full of false jumps and ludicrous scenarios, with a killer who can evidently move cars but doesn't know how to get through vinyl seat covers.  Even the changing of the minute on a digital clock earns a haunting 'dong' from the cheap soundtrack.  Suggestions of Penny starving are a little thin, considering that her whole ordeal occurs in the course of one night (one night where the moon goes through three different phases, evidently), and her fear of not knowing how to operate a car later miraculously disappears when she knows exactly what to do to move the car from between two trees.The potential this movie had was to play a card likeOpen Water--Penny could be stuck in the woods in the car with her dead therapist without the whole nonsense of a mad killer, and the fear and creepiness would have become much more palpable and as a result a lot more interesting.But no.

1045838,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B000MEYKE6,Paulo Leite,"[4, 5]","At a time like today when all horror films go special effects OR extreme violence, it is good to see one film that reminds us of the good old days when horror and thriller used to be the genres for the most creative people.So here it is: a girl who lost her parents in a freak accident (and developed a phobia of cars as a result) is riding with her psychiatrist to the place where the accident happened. On their way, they encounter a killer who locks the girl inside the car with the body of the dead psychiatrist. The killer has blocked all doors and will kill anyone who comes near the car.Nearly all the action takes place inside the car while the girl struggles to stay alive and not go crazy. And this is interesting because this is the kind of film that reminds us of similar (and successful) other the challenge of writing and shooting for closed sets. Some examples come to my mind:Rope,Lifeboat (Special Edition),Cujo (25th Anniversary Edition)(also set inside a car) andFail-safe (Special Edition)are just a few examples of the best films who took on the challenge.Of course this film is a much more modest entry. But successful in its own way. The acting is good, the cinematography and camera work are fine... but the only weaker part is the screenplay that does not deliver all the possibilities of the premise. And there are one or two plot holeshere and there... well... if the girl really wants to leave the car  (that's what it seems for quite some time) but the doors are blocked, why not break the windshield? It's glass, not bricks.Instead of concentrating on the drama, it is clear that the film makers had to compromise and go for the slasher genre the audience loves. It's understandable.Still it's a very good film. some people found it boring because, really, this is not the type of film we see today. There are no heads exploding, no cheap scares nor people being being sawed with weird appliances or other cutting paraphernalia: it's just a girl in a car with a killer outside.Mimi Rogers must must have hated this shotting: she is dead for half the film.",4,They don't make films like this anymore...,1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,2085,"['time', 'today', 'when', 'horror', 'films', 'go', 'special', 'effects', 'OR', 'extreme', 'violence', 'good', 'see', 'one', 'film', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'horror', 'thriller', 'used', 'be', 'genres', 'most', 'creative', 'people.So', 'here', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'parents', 'freak', 'accident', 'developed', 'phobia', 'cars', 'result', 'riding', 'psychiatrist', 'place', 'where', 'accident', 'happened', 'way', 'encounter', 'killer', 'who', 'girl', 'car', 'body', 'dead', 'psychiatrist', 'killer', 'blocked', 'doors', 'will', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'car.Nearly', 'action', 'place', 'car', 'girl', 'stay', 'alive', 'not', 'go', 'crazy', 'interesting', 'kind', 'film', 'similar', 'successful', 'other', 'challenge', 'writing', 'shooting', 'closed', 'sets', 'examples', 'come', 'mind', 'Rope', 'Lifeboat', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Cujo', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'also', 'set', 'inside', 'car', 'andFail-safe', 'Special', 'Edition', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'best', 'films', 'who', 'took', 'challenge.Of', 'course', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'modest', 'entry', 'successful', 'own', 'way', 'acting', 'good', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'fine', 'only', 'weaker', 'part', 'screenplay', 'not', 'deliver', 'possibilities', 'premise', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'plot', 'holeshere', 'there', 'well', 'girl', 'really', 'leave', 'car', 'what', 'quite', 'time', 'doors', 'are', 'blocked', 'why', 'not', 'break', 'windshield', 'glass', 'not', 'bricks.Instead', 'concentrating', 'drama', 'clear', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'compromise', 'go', 'slasher', 'genre', 'audience', 'understandable.Still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'people', 'found', 'boring', 'really', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'see', 'today', 'are', 'heads', 'exploding', 'cheap', 'scares', 'people', 'being', 'being', 'sawed', 'weird', 'appliances', 'other', 'cutting', 'paraphernalia', 'just', 'girl', 'car', 'killer', 'outside.Mimi', 'Rogers', 'must', 'must', 'have', 'hated', 'shotting', 'dead', 'film']",Penny Dreadful

I liked Unrest and the trailers for the other 7 looked good as well, though I decided not to buy Reincarnation because I don't like Japanese horror and I didn't buy The Hamiltons because the trailer just didn't 'grab' me.When I got Penny Dreadful in I knew I'd like it, the trailer made it look very good.  I just watched it for the 3rd time last night, as a matter of fact.The storyline was nicely tied together, and though it was pretty formula, you know, escaped mental patient slicing people up in a wooded area, the fact they filmed the most of this movie from the perspective of a girl trapped in a car was pretty cool.  I mean, what could they make happen if she's trapped in the car?  LOTS, and for the first time in a long time, I was creeped out by a movie I was watching, it's just that good.  They used the usual gratuitous buckets of blood along the way, lots of slice and dice, but overall it was better done and a heck of a lot creepier than most that have come down the pipe lately.I only gave it a 4 and not a 5 because it IS a formula slasher film.

Maybe it was the fact that they had real actors in the lead, or the story seemed interesting.  You see, Penny was involved in a bad car accident as a child that killed her parents.  Ever since then, she has not been able to ride in a car.  Her therapist however is taking her on a car ride to the spot she was going with her parents to complete the circle and try to cure her of her phobia.  Along the way however they run into a hitchhiker(literally) and that is when the fun starts.  The hitchhiker is a mad man who wants to kill them.  Bascially the plot boils down to a killer and a girl trying to overcome her fear of the car to beat the killer.  I still think most of these movies would have played better at 1 hour.  This series of films would have made a nice run on the Masters of Horror on showtime if they would have trimmed them down a bit, these just aren't full movie length ideas.  Penny Dreadful is a good movie most of the way, but has an ending that is terrible.  I was waiting for a great twist or some kind of surprise.

1045843,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000MEYKE6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 8]","Penny Dreadful (Richard Brandes, 2006)Another of those movies that someone seems to have messed up when distributing; I caught this on the Sci-Fi Channel, but it really seems to have a future on the Lifetime Movie Network. Consider: a higher-quality cast than the usual Sci-Fi Channel shocker (the two main characters are played by Californication's Rachel Miner and Lifetime Movie stalwart Mimi Rogers [Stone Cold, The Stranger Game, et al.]), a woman-in-danger-working-out-a-phobia plot, and, really, not much in the way of shocks at all.The story: Penny, a woman who's scared of cars (Miner), and her therapist Orianna (Rogers) are on a trip to the mountains so Penny can confront her fear of cars. Along the way, while Orianna is distracted, she hits a hitchhiker on the road. (While we never actually see the person hitchhiking, Penny refers to the person as ""the hitchhiker"" thereafter, so I'm assuming.) To atone for this, Orianna gives said hitchhiker a ride out to a desolate mountain camp. On their way back to the highway, Penny has an episode and has to get out of the car; when she does, she discovers the hitchhiker has pierced one of the back tores with a meat skewer. Thus begins a cat-and-mouse game between the women and the hitchhiker, whom, we soon find out, is not averse to a bit of the old ultra-violence on anyone who gets in the way of the fun little game being played with Penny's psyche.Brandes, writer of such direct-to-video fare as Martial Law (and its sequel) and Devil in the Flesh (and its sequel), makes the usual mistake one makes with movies such as this: there's nothing at all surprising in it. When minor characters are introduced, they immediately engage in the kind of behavior that stamps ""kill me"" on their foreheads (for a rundown of the behaviors that do this in horror films, cf. Wes Craven's Scream). Penny always runs into a seriously traumatic situation at the worst possible time, therefore advancing the plot. Without spoiling anything (I hope), the final scene is exactly the sort of thing one expects from a horror movie since the fifties or thereabouts. Worst of all, much of the film features Rachel Miner pulling her best Tom Hanks impression (think Cast Away here, not Forrest Gump) while combining it with her best Linnea Quigley impression (do I have to name a movie? Think ""scream queen"" here). And while Cast Away was at its heart about THaHAtA (Tom Hanks and His Ability to Act), Tom Hanks actually does have some pretty serious chops, as much as I hated Cast Away. RMaHAtA does not make nearly as gripping a film, when most of the acting Miner has to do involves screaming and the occasional bout of hyperventilation. That gal knows how to gobble a pill, however!Trite, predictable, boring. *",1,Title got it half right.,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,2755,"['Penny', 'Dreadful', 'Richard', 'Brandes', '2006', 'movies', 'someone', 'have', 'messed', 'up', 'when', 'distributing', 'caught', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'really', 'have', 'future', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'Consider', 'higher-quality', 'cast', 'usual', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'shocker', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Californication', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'stalwart', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', '[', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Stranger', 'Game', 'et', 'al', ']', 'woman-in-danger-working-out-a-phobia', 'plot', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'shocks', 'all.The', 'story', 'Penny', 'woman', 'who', 'scared', 'cars', 'Miner', 'therapist', 'Orianna', 'Rogers', 'are', 'trip', 'mountains', 'Penny', 'can', 'confront', 'fear', 'cars', 'way', 'Orianna', 'distracted', 'hitchhiker', 'road', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'person', 'hitchhiking', 'Penny', 'refers', 'person', 'hitchhiker', 'thereafter', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'atone', 'Orianna', 'said', 'hitchhiker', 'ride', 'desolate', 'mountain', 'camp', 'way', 'back', 'highway', 'Penny', 'episode', 'get', 'car', 'when', 'hitchhiker', 'pierced', 'one', 'back', 'tores', 'meat', 'skewer', 'Thus', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'women', 'hitchhiker', 'whom', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'averse', 'bit', 'old', 'ultra-violence', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'fun', 'little', 'game', 'being', 'played', 'Penny', 'psyche.Brandes', 'writer', 'such', 'direct-to-video', 'fare', 'Martial', 'Law', 'sequel', 'Devil', 'Flesh', 'sequel', 'usual', 'mistake', 'one', 'movies', 'such', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'When', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'immediately', 'engage', 'kind', 'behavior', 'kill', 'foreheads', 'rundown', 'behaviors', 'do', 'horror', 'films', 'cf', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Scream', 'Penny', 'always', 'seriously', 'traumatic', 'situation', 'worst', 'possible', 'time', 'therefore', 'advancing', 'plot', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'hope', 'final', 'scene', 'exactly', 'sort', 'thing', 'one', 'horror', 'movie', 'fifties', 'thereabouts', 'Worst', 'much', 'film', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'pulling', 'best', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'impression', 'think', 'Cast', 'Away', 'here', 'not', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'combining', 'best', 'Linnea', 'Quigley', 'impression', 'do', 'have', 'name', 'movie', 'Think', 'scream', 'queen', 'here', 'Cast', 'Away', 'was', 'heart', 'THaHAtA', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Ability', 'Act', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'actually', 'have', 'pretty', 'serious', 'chops', 'as', 'much', 'hated', 'Cast', 'Away', 'RMaHAtA', 'not', 'make', 'nearly', 'gripping', 'film', 'when', 'most', 'acting', 'Miner', 'do', 'involves', 'screaming', 'occasional', 'bout', 'hyperventilation', 'gal', 'how', 'gobble', 'pill', 'however', 'Trite', 'predictable', 'boring', '*']",Penny Dreadful

The scene where Penny is trapped in a car covered with blood while she hysterically recites the mantra of her feel-good cassettes all the while pulling the tape out is particularly memorable  and a frightfully clever ending had me wanting more.One thing's for sure... if Penny wasn't crazy before she definitely is now.  :o),4,Cars Are Bad,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,787,"['Penny', 'Dreadful', 'atmospheric', 'subtly', 'frightening', 'film', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'girl', 'terrorized', 'even', 'more', 'disturbed', 'ghoulish', 'assailant', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'jumping', 'cringing', 'few', 'minutes', 'particularly', 'effective', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'dread', 'particularly', 'time', 'Penny', 'awakes', 'periods', 'sedative', 'induced', 'sleep', 'night', 'suspended', 'time', 'causing', 'suspense', 'just', 'keep', 'building', 'scene', 'where', 'Penny', 'trapped', 'car', 'covered', 'blood', 'hysterically', 'mantra', 'feel-good', 'cassettes', 'while', 'pulling', 'tape', 'out', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'frightfully', 'clever', 'ending', 'had', 'wanting', 'more.One', 'thing', 'sure', 'Penny', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'definitely', 'now', 'o']",Penny Dreadful

Penny Dreadful provides a fresh take on slasher films. In fact, I rather hate calling it a slasher but that's ultimately where it will be lumped. What Penny Dreadful really is, is a psychological horror and a powerful one at that. Not for those who are claustrophobic for sure!The film stars Rachel Miner, best known for her riveting performance in ""Bully"" as Penny Deerborn, a young woman whose deep rooted fears have virtually handicapped her life after she was traumatized by an auto accident which killed both of her parents. Penny's fears seem to be many but start with a fear of cars. She is traveling with her Psychologist Orianna (played by Mimi Rogers) to the scene of the accident to confront her fears.Along the way they hit a person hitchhiking along a dark stretch of road. Seeing that the person is ok, they offer the mysterious hitchhiker a ride to a nearby campground (ha ha ha) and by now the silent passenger has even creeped out the Doctor and she's anxious to be rid of their rider as soon as possible. You can probably guess the hitchhiker turns out to be a crazed killer but that might be the last thing that is stereotypical about Penny Dreadful. Unlike so many other recent horror slashers, Penny Dreadful doesn't seek to amaze viewers with creative new ways to kill, nor is it all that gory. Rather, this is a study in terror.The killer eventually traps Penny in the car, wedging it between two large trees so she cannot open the doors. The bulk of the picture is spent within the dark, frigid confines of the car as the killer merely toys with Penny, making her witness to several murders, and delighting in her fear and helplessness. With so much of the film taking place in one static location, it does tend to slow things down quite a bit and those who crave action and a high body count may be disappointed.But it is this fact that sets Penny Dreadful apart from other recent films such as the under whelming remake of Black Christmas. There are seemingly no connections here between killer and victim. No acts of revenge for what happened to the killer as a little kid. No misguided, moralistic reasons for killing like in the ""Saw"" film series. In fact, this is truly more terrifying because the psycho in Penny Dreadful is the very definition of a random killer.Perhaps not for everyone's tasted but a solid, subtle horror-thriller, deftly directed by Richard Brandes. Look for horror icon Michael Berryman in a cameo role.REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",4,"A SUBTLE, SATISFYING HORROR",1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,2614,"['One', 'things', ""'ve"", 'really', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'far', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'films', 'refreshing', 'take', 'popular', 'horror', 'concepts', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'fresh', 'take', 'slasher', 'films', 'fact', 'rather', 'hate', 'calling', 'slasher', 'ultimately', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'lumped', 'What', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'really', 'psychological', 'horror', 'powerful', 'one', 'Not', 'who', 'are', 'claustrophobic', 'sure', 'film', 'stars', 'Rachel', 'Miner', 'best', 'known', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Bully', 'Penny', 'Deerborn', 'young', 'woman', 'deep', 'rooted', 'fears', 'have', 'virtually', 'handicapped', 'life', 'was', 'traumatized', 'auto', 'accident', 'killed', 'parents', 'Penny', 'fears', 'seem', 'be', 'many', 'start', 'fear', 'cars', 'traveling', 'Psychologist', 'Orianna', 'played', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'scene', 'accident', 'confront', 'fears.Along', 'way', 'hit', 'person', 'hitchhiking', 'dark', 'stretch', 'road', 'Seeing', 'person', 'ok', 'offer', 'mysterious', 'hitchhiker', 'ride', 'nearby', 'campground', 'ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'now', 'silent', 'passenger', 'even', 'creeped', 'out', 'Doctor', 'anxious', 'be', 'rid', 'rider', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'hitchhiker', 'out', 'be', 'crazed', 'killer', 'might', 'be', 'last', 'thing', 'stereotypical', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'Unlike', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'recent', 'horror', 'slashers', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', ""n't"", 'seek', 'amaze', 'viewers', 'creative', 'new', 'ways', 'kill', 'gory', 'Rather', 'study', 'terror.The', 'killer', 'eventually', 'Penny', 'car', 'wedging', 'two', 'large', 'trees', 'can', 'not', 'open', 'doors', 'bulk', 'picture', 'spent', 'dark', 'frigid', 'confines', 'car', 'killer', 'merely', 'Penny', 'making', 'witness', 'several', 'murders', 'delighting', 'fear', 'helplessness', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'one', 'static', 'location', 'tend', 'slow', 'things', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'who', 'crave', 'action', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed.But', 'fact', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'apart', 'other', 'recent', 'films', 'such', 'whelming', 'remake', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'are', 'seemingly', 'connections', 'here', 'killer', 'victim', 'acts', 'revenge', 'what', 'happened', 'killer', 'little', 'kid', 'misguided', 'moralistic', 'reasons', 'killing', 'Saw', 'film', 'series', 'fact', 'truly', 'more', 'terrifying', 'psycho', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'very', 'definition', 'random', 'not', 'everyone', 'tasted', 'solid', 'subtle', 'horror-thriller', 'deftly', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Brandes', 'Look', 'horror', 'icon', 'Michael', 'Berryman', 'cameo', 'role.REVIEWED', 'BY', 'TIM', 'JANSON']",Penny Dreadful

It's a boring film that was much too long, a ridiculous story, with horrible acting, and laughable text. A girl whose parents were killed in a car accident when she was a kid is now afraid of being in cars. To get over this fear she is going on a road trip, with her psychologist, where a creepy man they hit with the car comes after them. I know most horror films aren't written by Pulitzer Prize winners, but this is honestly the dumbest, most ridiculous story I've ever seen.
