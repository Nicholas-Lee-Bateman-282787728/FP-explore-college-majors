He seems defensive in the first few eps , and of course we all are when starting a new job. And it's even worse for a actor who is taking the lead on such a beloved show. This show is internationally loved and watched. It will never be the same show , as now all of it's main characters are gone. Speaking of season 15. where dci jones moves on too.  But he's still in this set.  Which aired back in 2011. The show gets more quirky in the last four of the season , which is this set. but let's be honest , the show is a old favorite and it's best years are behind it. But it can still provide us with quirky tales of murder. And this set is by far better than the last. But that's because the new detective is finally making it his own. And that makes the last set seem correct. As one would expect a new detective to settle in and then make this new turf his. And that's what is happening. which means that those who complain about last season too loudly , miss the point of character development. But , this is a easier watch for sure. THe stag night episode is wacky for sure. The abbey murder episode is more straight mystery, but it runs smoothly.  I liked the last set too. but it's never going to be the show that it was back in 97-2009. That's ok though, as it is still a good and quirky show that will continue on for at laast several years. And we fans will continue to enjoy it. after all the other quirky detective shows are all off the air pretty much. Blue murder, rosmary and tyne, jpmnathon creek. all of them could have had longer runs but the brits never made enough eps.

His arrogant and condescending version of the main character is similar to Roy Marsden failure to portray the main character Adam Dalgliesh. There is no chemistry with the wife and even the dog failed to save Neil this time. Interesting enough, the new Coroner seems to bring some potential future to the relations. The Stag just brings shame to the rural side of England and their police organization. That crossed the line so well established in the earlier version of Barnaby: No weapons and a little out of shape but still believable. Midsommer should be praying there is no terrorist in your area. I am quite surprised the British did not formally complain for this episode.I watched some of the interviews. Jason should leave. He needs to show character and just leave. He has great potential but I feel he settles for a lousy character. He would be a perfect sidekick in Inspector Lewis type of series. The episode with John Nettles where he infiltrated a cult was his greatest performance and provided a glimpse of what Jason Hughes can do.Now, what is it with main actors like Warren Clarke and Kevin Whately that need to go outside of a well establish dimension of their persona in their own series.

1595642,A1C70R9KCILEU,B009DS5OEM,Elle,"[28, 32]","I have been an avid and devout fan of Midsomer Murders from its first airing.  I have re-watched every episode.  Suffice it to say, I was heartbroken when John Nettles as DCI Tom Barnaby left the show. I was doubtful that the series could carry on without him.  Still, trying to be optimistic; I held out hope that I could learn to enjoy the series with Neil Dudgeon as DCI John Barnaby.  I like Neil Dudgeon. I saw him in The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries and thought he was charming.My opinion and this review is definitely slanted by my love and enjoyment of the original.  I have tried to judge the ""new"" show on its own merits and it does have one, which I'll mention when I've finished ranting.  I can't do an unbiased review.  I can't help but compare.  I am in mourning for the original.My grief is fresh as I just barely finished this latest installment.  The first four episodes without John Nettles were an incredible disappointment but I wanted to be fair; giving new DCI John Barnaby and DS Ben Jones some time to gel.  Sadly, in my opinion, these four episodes show no improvement over the previous four. In fact, I found them to be worse. As of this writing, I am not looking forward to the next set and don't think I'll watch it.My biggest complaint has to be the appearance of contempt for the existing department, lead by Tom Barnaby, specifically his long-time sergeant, Ben Jones, and pathologist, Dr. George Bullard (who left the show in the first installment of the ""new"" MSM,) displayed by DCI John Barnaby.  This was confusing to me because John and Tom are cousins and Tom was no slouch!  Why the contempt? In addition, Jones and Bullard were also exceptional at their respective jobs.  Why did the writers do this?  There was no need to make John out to be the savior of a sinking ship! Of course he's going to do things his way, but why this, arrogance and smugness?I hate what has been done to DS Ben Jones played by Jason Hughes.  Before writing this review I watched again every episode since Jones, then a PC, joined the show in House in the Woods.  He began as a bright lad who caught the attention of DCI Tom Barnaby and was elevated to DC to work alongside Barnaby. I watched him grow as a detective and he earned his sergeant rank in This Year's Model.  The writing played up a rapport between Barnaby and Jones that was often comical but always respectful.  I enjoyed this aspect of MSM with all of Barnaby's sergeants over the seasons.I guess I have taken, what I see as an affront to Jones, personally.  Silly, I suppose, for a grown-up to do regarding a television program, but nonetheless here I sit whining and wailing.  If I drank, I might be crying into a pint of bitter or a G&T.;  Ben's character has taken a beating, and I don't think it was necessary in order to show that DCI John Barnaby is a good detective.  Jones's fun and often funny interactions with Tom Barnaby and other supporting cast members left when the cast left but couldn't something along the same line be emulated? I lay my disapproval, disappointment, and crankiness directly at the feet of whomever is responsible for making this ""new"" MSM what it is! It is not Dudgeon's fault, in fact he plays his part as DCI John Barnaby brilliantly.I smile when I think back over some of the funnier scenes with Jones, the look on his face in Country Matters when it sinks in just what is going on at the culinary school, riding stables, and shooting center.  Then there is his floundering around for the right way to describe a rather lurid depiction of an ""orgy"" and coming up with, ""loin-instigated"" in The Animal Within. Or the time, in The Black Book, his obvious discomfort looking at an intimate nude painting and said, ""Nice rods,"" referring to some split cane fishing rods hanging adjacent to the painting. Now, he seems to be an inept joke.I read that Hughes has left the show.  I haven't verified the truth of this, and if it is true; I don't know the circumstances surrounding his leaving, but if it was by his own choosing, I don't blame him.  I hope he's moving on to something as good or better than his role of Ben Jones alongside John Nettles as Tom Barnaby.  Hughes's leaving will complete the mass exodus from the original MSM. So, the series I loved is no more. Farewell to: John Nettles as the incomparable DCI Tom Barnaby, Jane Wymark as Tom's wife Joyce, Laura Howard as their daughter Cully, Kirsty Dillon as DC Gail Stephens, Barry Jackson as Dr. George Bullard, and now Jason Hughes.I guess it is too late to suggest that perhaps a smarter route to have taken was in making DCI John Barnaby a spin-off such as Inspector Lewis from the Morse series.  Maybe that would have been a better choice straight out of the box?I won't go into detail about each episode since Nettles left (eight, as of this writing Aug. 2013) but I just have to mention Night of the Stag in this set.  I have enjoyed many of the previous fanciful and far-fetched plot premises of the past, but Night of the Stag went too far.  Way, way, way too far!  I think I watched the entire ninety minutes with my mouth open in stunned shock.  I kept looking over at my husband and as we exchanged looks of disgust; I heard myself saying things like, ""Oh, my gosh! They've got to be joking!!! This is a nightmarish dream sequence, right? Someone's going to wake up and it will all be over, right? What in the world?"" As the final scene of this episode came to an end, I was certain that Jones, Barnaby, or both were going to be killed and thus would end not only the nightmare of this terrible episode but what was for me, the nightmare of this set.When reading this review please keep in mind that I am in mourning.Oh, the one thing I found enjoyable about this new MSM? I love the dog, Sykes.

1595643,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B009DS5OEM,FYI,"[108, 113]","In the U.K., these four mysteries were originally part of a season with four previous episodes, released here as ""Set 21."" Thankfully, these four stories return to the offbeat, humorous alternative universe that Midsomer fans crave. What could be more enticing than pints of bubbly cider with DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) and DI Ben Jones (Jason Hughes)? But beware, in Midomer County, even Beltane celebrations are treacherous. Children dance around a Maypole, whilst fat sausages roast under the refreshments tent, and the cider is not all it seems. Midsomer is a remarkably deadly place, a deceptively delicious chocolate box filled poisoned confections. Generations of loyal inhabitants risk life and limb to live in Midsomer's bucolic hills and dales. Thankfully, DCI John Barnaby is as gifted at detection as his cousin Tom. The Barnaby line is rooted in Midsomer's earth, they are dependable in never being surprised by bizarre occurrences. Nothing flummoxes or gobsmacks a true Barnaby. The excellent actor Neil Dudgeon enriches Midsomer with his wry nuance. And Jason Hughes is intrepid as Detective Inspector Ben Jones, his humor adds another level of complexity to the series. Coziness in the U.K. has a macabre stain; like a lace doily blotched with tea, darkness lurks at the edges. In Midsomer County's dangerous environs, denizens inflict and suffer numerous creative malaises.The U.K. boasts numerous fine (and often underrated) actors. While you impatiently wait for more ""Midsomer,"" you may want to catch Neil Dudgeon in an unforgettable performance in a superb story in episode 3 of the first season of the BAFTA Award winning seriesThe Street Complete Collection. Neil Dudgeon plays Brian Peterson, a teacher accused of being a flasher. Ultimately, who is the betrayer? His wife claims she has never known him, perhaps it is the other way around. As Brian Peterson gazes out of a taxi window passing street after fogbound street, you understand that each street is full of stories, each person's life with it's moments of mystery. Be aware thatThe Streetis gritty, rough, and harrowing, quite unlike Midsomer!As to these four eagerly anticipated episodes of ""Midsomer,"" each story is 90 minutes long, and subtitles are provided. Further episodes have been created since this offering, but their U.S. release is a long slog away. Some impatient Midsomer fans resort to purchasing via the U.K., to play on Region-free DVD players.The Sleeper Under The HillMidsomer fans know that under the cheery, bucolic surface of Midsomer's green hills and dales, a darkly pagan heart fiercely lurks; this helps explain the untoward death-toll. On Crowcall Farm, Alex Preston wants to plow Gorse Meadow. But local New Dawn Druids desire free access to the Meadow, since it contains the sacred stone Crowcall Circle. In a typically gruesome Midsomer death, Preston is found disemboweled on the central stone of the sacred circle. The farmer's wife is too glamorous, and indulges in a dalliance with her fencing-master. A poacher is accused of malfeasance, whilst lay-lines and archaeological artifacts come into play. Barnaby and Jones must unearth local village gossip and history to solve the mystery.The Night of The StagWatch out! It's another pagan holiday in Midsomer County, where moonshiner investigators have it hard. Why ruin a vat of cider with a corpse? Answer: this is Midsomer, after all! And poor DCI John Barnaby gets quite sick on the unsavoury stuff. His dog Sykes is not impressed. During Beltane celebrations, an investigator of illegally produced alcohol is found dead in cider-vat. Barnaby and Jones believe the whole community is somehow involved. Families go so far back that they call one orchard-owner ""French"" because his ancestors only came over with William the Conqueror. The unsavory murder may be related to the revival of an old, pagan Midsomer traditions, while guest-star Warren Clarke does a memorable turn in a deer-skull. Beware horns in Midsomer!Sacred TrustAfter a chapel's lovely stained-glass window is broken, a nun is found murdered in Midsomer Priory, a secluded community in a lovely edifice that houses the nuns of the Order of Saint Mathilde. The murder forces the nuns to permit the outside world access into their world; enter our intrepid detectives Barnaby and Jones. They discover that the community is vulnerable to relinquishing ownership, and their priest is no help. The Priory is subject to a Deed of Trust that only allows the Order to remain living there only as long as there is a viable community. If the Order fractures, the ownership reverts to the original benefactor's heirs. Beneath the calm face of the Priory, Barnaby and Jones must untangle a skein of motives, while the Order's ancient silver goes missing, and teenagers run amiss.A Rare BirdBeware the power of the tweet. The president of the local Ornithological Society, Patrick Morgan, is a brittle bloke, myopic about birds, distracted by binoculars, and his delicate Russian ballerina of a wife is preggers. Without much assistance from said ornithologist. So he suspects every man in Midsomer-in-the-Marsh of impregnating her. The rare Blue Crested Hoopoe has made a controversial appearance in the village, setting birders against one another. DCI Barnaby annoys his dog, and his wife, with his surprising lack of map-skills in the woods. Death looms like a loon-call on a lake, and Patrick is lured to his demise. Barnaby and Jones face frustrations whilst investigating Midsomer-in-the-Marsh's binocular-weaponed world of bird watching.Special Features: Cast Filmographies, Picture Gallery, Writer Biography,

1595646,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B009DS5OEM,Happy Reader,"[2, 2]","I'm a fan who's collected all of the ""Midsomer Murders"" DVD sets. This Set 22 (out of 22 so far) has 4 discs with 1 episode each. The episodes range from classic Midsomer Murders (great plots with a hint of strangeness) to downright odd.The ""Midsomer Murders"" characters are based on the original mystery novels by Caroline Graham. The best, both in books and TV show episodes, is the very first of both, ""The Killings at Badger's Drift"". It set the tone with perfect plotting and strong characters, including an eerie mother-son duo who made your skin crawl.1.  ""The Sleeper Under the Hill"" (episode 86) Evan Jago and his faithful dog are out in the woods, poaching (the squeal of the caught rabbit is maybe unneeded verisimilitude). Evan sees crows circling over a meadow and goes to investigate. In the middle of the meadow, there is an ancient stone circle, smaller than Stonehenge but still impressive. What really captures Evan's attention, though, is a man's body lying on it's back, draped over the small bloodstone (like an alter stone) in the middle. The man is quite dead and crows are pecking at him.Barnaby and Jones investigate. The body is that of Alex Preston, who owned the land and had put up barbed wire fence to keep everyone, including the local druids, away from the circle. But the druids are dedicated to peace, aren't they? There must be another reason for Preston's death.Though I enjoyed it, ""The Sleeper Under the Hill"" veers a little into gothic B-movie plotting. Written by David Lawrence (Harsent). The town is Midsomer Mow.2.  ""The Night of the Stag"" (episode 87) It's dark and a man in a suit and tie runs for his life through an orchard. Faceless men with dogs chase him. He stumbles down a hillock, wrenching his ankle, and is surrounded. Before the dazed man has time to think, a huge machine off to the side fires up, floodlights blinding as it approaches him with a terrible roar.The next scene is jolting, because from the night horror we go straight into cheerful country music and daylight at the Midsomer Abbas May Fair. Jones and Barnaby are in town passing out fliers, seeking information on a missing man, Peter Slim. Yes, it's the man we saw being chased. It turns out he was a revenue agent, what we'd call an I.R.S. agent. This is a village known for it's hard cider, and Jones and Barnaby partake. Barnaby's sweet cider goes down smoothly, but then his stomach start lurching. He's not the only one throwing up before the beekeeper shouts to the cider mill owner, ""French! Your barrel's bad. The sweet! It's ratty.""Eee-uu, rats drowning in the cider vat? But it's worse than that. The mill owner finds Slim's body in his vat.There's more side-plots and convolutions than you can shake a stick at, and you can bet that a Midsomer murder isn't about something as simple as tax avoidance. However, the plot of ""The Night of the Stag"" devolves into poor melodrama and from there I just got annoyed. There's good acting, but it's lost in the goofy storyline.Screen play by Nicholas Martin. The towns are Midsomer Abbas and Midsomer Herne.3.  ""A Sacred Trust"" (episode 88) Added danger always makes it better, right? A young couple is making whoopie on the wooded grounds of a priory, when someone in a nun's habit, face hidden, stands over them waving her arms. The startled kids run off half-dressed, and when they circle back, the boy's trousers are gone. In retaliation, the next night, the boy and four friends scale the priory walls, and throw bottles through the stained glass windows of the priory church. He's not very nice, this young man. Probably someone has taught him well how to be a bully.DS Jones tries to investigate the window smashing, but prioress Mother Julian will not let him in. Jones asks, ""Don't you want us to catch whoever did it?""She replies, ""We'd rather pray for them.""Unfortunately, she has to change her mind about letting the police in. There's only four sisters left in Midsomer Priory. And the next night, one of them is strangled while checking on the henhouse. That leaves only three nuns left, and their chaplain, the young priest, Duncan Hendred, gives Barnaby and Jones a very interesting interview: ""The original nuns of the priory were French aristocrats, Inspector, and the present lot regard themselves as their heirs. Whatever was going on, they'd put up a show in front of the servants. Which is, essentially, how they see me.""This is an interesting episode, and I found that watching it a second time allowed me to better ponder the sins & vices shown. How about pride? If the roof needs fixing, and you refuse to sell heirlooms to fix it, are you being prideful or are you honoring your traditions?  Even nuns can disagree on this.  Screenplay by Rachel Cuperman and Sally Griffiths. The town is Midsomer Vertue.4.  ""A Rare Bird"" (episode 89) Someone is spying on a couple in a mansion. A long-distance microphone tied to a fence picks up their conversation inside the house. A camera with a long distance lens takes photos through the windows. And so the spy hears the overjoyed wife tell her husband that she's pregnant. And the husband howls, ""Who's is it?""Then we are plopped into the middle of a birding feud. It is serious stuff. Ralph Ford has claimed he sighted a Blue-Crested Hoopoe, an endangered species native to Uganda and seldom seen in England. As a ""mega"" sighting, he would get 10 points and win the annual List Competition for the Midsomer-in-the-Marsh Ornithological Society. The points are denied him, though, by Patrick Morgan - who we've already met as the angry husband. When Morgan's body turns up, caught in a birder's net and drowned in the lake, there are suspects and motives to choose from.For fun, I googled ""blue-crested hoopoe"" and found birdforum(.)net. Reading their take on Midsomer Murders birds was fun to read. Here's just one comment on the ""A Rare Bird"" episode: ""It was hilarious; apart from the netted Greenfinch and the fictitious 'Blue-crowned Hoopoe' every bird mentioned was North American... Yellow-rumped Warbler, Black-throated Blue Warbler, Meadowlark and Sage Sparrow... forget the Scillies and Fair Isle, clearly Midsomer is the place to go birding! Seriously though it is shocking the writers couldn't do five minutes research to find what birds would be seen in typical British countryside.""Screenplay by Steve Trafford. The town is Midsomer-in-the-Marsh.Bonus Feature: The bonus feature is on disc 1, titled ""Midsomer Murders in Conversation"" (35 minutes). This consists of clips from the show and interviews recorded while they were filming series 14 (the English series 14, which equals the U.S. DVD Sets 21 & 22).  Commentators include Neil Dudgeon (plays DCI John Barnaby), Jason Hughes (plays DS Ben Jones), Jim Parker (composer for ""Midsomer Murders since the beginning), James Moss (director photography), Paul Bennett (2nd assistant director), James Nash (location manager), Lou Hooper (3rd assistant director), Jeff Hudson (unit driver), Andy Bailey (gaffer), Martin Cox (best boy), Liam Ryan (boom operator), Mark Soar (location caterer), Colin Skeaping (stunt coordinator) and Colin Stephens (facilities).This was an enjoyable extra, with Dudgeon (a natural story-teller) and Hughes talking about their very early experiences with acting.Hughes made an interesting comment on the Midsomer Murders musical theme, that hadn't occurred to me before: ""What I find very interesting about the tune is that you can't hum it. You have to make up a silly sound to do dooddly-diddly-do.""  That is so true! Parker mentions that the haunting tune is played on a theramin.All episodes and the bonus feature have English subtitles available.",5,"1 Bonus Feature, Episode Synopsis For Set 22",1376092800,"08 10,

1595647,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B009DS5OEM,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[6, 8]","It's back to the basics. Guest stars in stellar settings with multiple murders for Barnaby and DS Jones to solve. Neil Dudgeon seems to have come into his own with the lead of this crime mystery series. Jason Hughes adds the assistant elements needed to make this as inviting as the1997 series beginning. Fiona Dolman is stepping up with her own important thread as Barnaby's wife; and Tamzin Malleson is now a regular as the important Dr. Wilding, forensics. The humor and personal relationships have returned as sub-plots, like, and just as good as, days of old.SUBTITLES available and this 2 episode set is also buyable on Blu-ray.The earliest episodes of Midsomer Murder are now being re-released in new sets in the order of TV airing, and the earliest episodes now contain SUBTITLES. See ""Midsomer Murders: Series 1"" for example.The Sleeper Under the HillMidsomer farmer Preston is disemboweled as a stone circle sacrifice in a mini-Stonehenge-like setting. Poacher Evan discovered the body and an obvious suspect but locals high priest Druids are also suggested, as is lovely Mrs Preston (Claudia Harrison- `Murphy's Law'). A suspect then killed. A great pub scene with fiddle--all too brief. A 3rd murder; Midsomer tradition that lives on.The Night of the StagA missing revenue man is the last thing this boot-leg beer community wants. He dead in a (hard) cider vat. And gives Barnaby and Jones a case to solve and the town drinks on. Star Warren Clarke plays Samuel Quested, a local; and ciderman Anthony Devereau is played by Patrick Ryecart (King's Speech, Nancherrow, Coming Home). More to this cider tale than just a body.Sacred TrustMother Julian (Joanna David (Pride and Prejudice) wants no investigation into the chapel's vandalized stained glass window. A murder forces the issue and opens the priory doors where secrets lurk inside.A Rare BirdReminiscent of the film ""The Big Year"" (2011) released just prior to this 2012 episode. If you like this episode, you'll like the film, and vice-versa. Patrick Morgan (Alexander Hanson) loves birds but questions his wife Nina (Genevieve O'Reilly). Who impregnated her? A rival birder? A Hoopoe bird sighting sets the bird watching locals in frenzy. The call of the wild is a call to murder, and Barnaby must find his way in the woods. Birder Ralph (James Dreyfus- `Notting Hill'); a local ladies'-man (Paul Nicholls- `The Passion' playing Judas); & a feuding neighbor (Tony Haygarth- `Emerdale') all provide star suspects.The 34 minute bonus cast-staff interview footage is as interesting as an episode.",5,"Midsomer 22 classically written, brilliant locations",1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,2563,"['back', 'basics', 'Guest', 'stars', 'stellar', 'settings', 'multiple', 'murders', 'Barnaby', 'DS', 'Jones', 'solve', 'Neil', 'Dudgeon', 'have', 'come', 'own', 'lead', 'crime', 'mystery', 'series', 'Jason', 'Hughes', 'assistant', 'elements', 'needed', 'make', 'as', 'inviting', 'the1997', 'series', 'beginning', 'Fiona', 'Dolman', 'stepping', 'up', 'own', 'important', 'thread', 'Barnaby', 'wife', 'Tamzin', 'Malleson', 'now', 'regular', 'important', 'Dr.', 'Wilding', 'forensics', 'humor', 'personal', 'relationships', 'have', 'returned', 'sub-plots', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'days', 'old.SUBTITLES', 'available', '2', 'episode', 'set', 'also', 'buyable', 'Blu-ray.The', 'earliest', 'episodes', 'Midsomer', 'Murder', 'are', 'now', 'being', 're-released', 'new', 'sets', 'order', 'TV', 'airing', 'earliest', 'episodes', 'now', 'contain', 'SUBTITLES', 'See', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', '1', 'example.The', 'Sleeper', 'HillMidsomer', 'farmer', 'Preston', 'disemboweled', 'stone', 'circle', 'sacrifice', 'mini-Stonehenge-like', 'setting', 'Evan', 'discovered', 'body', 'obvious', 'suspect', 'locals', 'high', 'priest', 'Druids', 'are', 'also', 'suggested', 'lovely', 'Mrs', 'Preston', 'Claudia', 'Harrison-', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'suspect', 'then', 'killed', 'great', 'pub', 'scene', 'fiddle', 'too', 'brief', '3rd', 'murder', 'Midsomer', 'tradition', 'on.The', 'Night', 'StagA', 'missing', 'revenue', 'man', 'last', 'thing', 'boot-leg', 'beer', 'community', 'dead', 'hard', 'cider', 'vat', 'Barnaby', 'Jones', 'case', 'solve', 'town', 'drinks', 'Star', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'Samuel', 'Quested', 'local', 'ciderman', 'Anthony', 'Devereau', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Ryecart', 'King', 'Speech', 'Nancherrow', 'Coming', 'Home', 'More', 'cider', 'tale', 'just', 'body.Sacred', 'TrustMother', 'Julian', 'Joanna', 'David', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'investigation', 'chapel', 'vandalized', 'stained', 'glass', 'window', 'murder', 'issue', 'priory', 'doors', 'where', 'secrets', 'lurk', 'inside.A', 'Rare', 'BirdReminiscent', 'film', 'Big', 'Year', '2011', 'released', 'just', 'prior', '2012', 'episode', 'like', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film', 'vice-versa', 'Patrick', 'Morgan', 'Alexander', 'Hanson', 'birds', 'questions', 'wife', 'Nina', 'Genevieve', ""O'Reilly"", 'Who', 'impregnated', 'rival', 'birder', 'Hoopoe', 'bird', 'sighting', 'sets', 'bird', 'watching', 'locals', 'frenzy', 'call', 'wild', 'call', 'murder', 'Barnaby', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'woods', 'Birder', 'Ralph', 'James', 'Dreyfus-', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'local', ""ladies'-man"", 'Paul', 'Nicholls-', 'Passion', 'playing', 'Judas', 'feuding', 'neighbor', 'Tony', 'Haygarth-', 'Emerdale', 'provide', 'star', 'suspects.The', '34', 'minute', 'bonus', 'cast-staff', 'interview', 'footage', 'as', 'interesting', 'episode']",N/A

1595653,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B009DS5OEM,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","While earlier episodes starring Neil Dudgeon, the new Barnaby in Midsomer, tended towards a darker tone, Set 22 of MIDSOMER MURDERS returns to a lighter touch. Of course there are still plenty of lovely means of dispatching victims at hand to keep fans happy. These, along with those curious eccentricities (The Night of the Stag) that define the very essence of Englishness, are the steak and kidney pie of the show, without which MIDSOMER MURDERS would rapidly waste away.Perhaps such familiarities are even more important now that we have eased into the Dudgeon era of the show. Be that as it may, the return to England&#8217;s murder capitol that is precipitated by each new set is fun, relaxing and enjoyable.The first episode, The Sleeper under the Hill, is average MIDSOMER, but the disc also contains a very charming extended interview with Neil Dudgeon, and another with Jason Hughes. While he&#8217;s not John Nettles (who is?) Dudgeon is a very charming man in his own right and his riff on the MIDSOMER theme music is quite delightful.Lest anyone think the writing is becoming lax need look no further than The Night of the Stag for a reference (including a direct quote attributed to King Henry II) to the murder of Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170. This is not only clever, it is subtle and the allusion is left only for those who catch it&#8212;no explanation is offered. Touches such as this show the creative minds behind MIDSOMER MURDERS recognize the intelligence of their audience.In the set&#8217;s third episode, A Sacred Trust, some steps are taken (inadvertently, perhaps) to portray people of faith a little more respectfully. The episode features a handful of nuns who, eccentric though some of them may be, are shown to be real, intelligent people. This is a welcome change to the show&#8217;s propensity for making anyone who expresses a certain spiritual perspective (specifically Christianity) automatically the villain.And why shouldn&#8217;t MIDSOMER MURDERS acknowledge this foible? The show clearly aims to please, never losing sight (as some of the grittier police shows do) that audiences wish to be entertained. That is why we enjoy such touches as Barnaby&#8217;s interaction with his dog, Sykes. It&#8217;s fun.The best surprise of set 22, however, is the last episode, A Rare Bird. It is exceptional, with some of the best direction I&#8217;ve ever seen in a MIDSOMER MURDERS episode. Some very clever camera effects are on hand, though they always serve the story and never seem superfluous. Of these segments, the ballet flashback is particularly effective. This episode is a return to the very best this show has to offer.MIDSOMER MURDERS is a perennial favourite world-wide, not just in the UK. There are even Midsomer tours for fans of the show to indulge their guilty pleasure. When a television show becomes a tourist industry that is the time to really take stock. As it stands today, MIDSOMER MURDERS still has plenty of life in it. That says a lot about the quality of the creative artists and the traditional tastes of its (significantly large) audience.The series is still in production, and there are almost a dozen episodes already broadcast in the UK that haven&#8217;t yet been released in North America.

In the county of Midsomer, things aren't always what they seem, and there is murder lurking behind many of the well trimmed hedges. The series, which was inspired by the novels by Caroline Graham, offers a selection of murder mysteries filled with intrigue and drama. I received the Midsomer Murder Set 22 to review, and although I have only seen the series in bits and pieces,  I was able to follow along with no trouble. Each episode stands on its own and offers its own unique and suspenseful storyline.The season reunites a great cast with lots of British humor and wonderfully written mysteries. I loved that druids came into play this season. The face off between the detectives and the high priests were humorous  to watch. Next a tax collector shows up dead in a vat of cider, a nun is strangled, and the president of a bird club in killed. I love how each mystery is unique and doesn't follow the modern trends.
