123464,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0792107128,,"[0, 0]","While this was the movie that earned John Wayne his Academy Award, the real star was Kim Darby as the headstrong young girl (Mattie Ross) that never wavers in her determination to get her way. When her father is killed by Tom Chaney, Mattie vows to see that justice is done. She seeks out craggy old Marshall Rooster Cogburn played by Wayne and hires him to hunt Chaney down so that he can be hanged. They are joined by a young Texas Ranger named La Boeuf, played by Glen Campbell and the three of them enter Indian Territory in pursuit of the criminal gang that Chaney has joined.The dialog between Mattie and Rooster is antagonistic, but it is not long before Wayne takes a fatherly interest in the young Mattie. As they carry out their adventures, the much younger La Boeuf begins to grow romantically attached to Mattie, but she quickly rebuffs his overtures. She is single-minded in her goals and often makes rather absurd suggestions regarding their best course of action. One of the best scenes is when a frontier ""doctor"" is about to dress a hand wound suffered by Le Boeuf. Mattie objects when the ""doctor"" begins his examination before washing his hands.While there is a great deal of the actions typical of video westerns, this one is made unique by Darby in the Mattie character. Westerns are rarely known for their dialog, but in this case it is the quality of the dialog and the delivery that raised the level of the movie to the Academy Award level.",5,"Dialog, rather than gunplay, made this movie great",1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,1464,"['was', 'movie', 'earned', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Academy', 'Award', 'real', 'star', 'was', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'headstrong', 'young', 'girl', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'never', 'wavers', 'determination', 'get', 'way', 'When', 'father', 'killed', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Mattie', 'see', 'justice', 'done', 'out', 'craggy', 'old', 'Marshall', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'played', 'Wayne', 'hunt', 'Chaney', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'hanged', 'are', 'joined', 'young', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'named', 'La', 'Boeuf', 'played', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'three', 'enter', 'Indian', 'Territory', 'pursuit', 'criminal', 'gang', 'Chaney', 'joined.The', 'dialog', 'Mattie', 'Rooster', 'antagonistic', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Wayne', 'fatherly', 'interest', 'young', 'Mattie', 'carry', 'out', 'adventures', 'much', 'younger', 'La', 'Boeuf', 'grow', 'romantically', 'attached', 'Mattie', 'quickly', 'rebuffs', 'overtures', 'single-minded', 'goals', 'often', 'rather', 'absurd', 'suggestions', 'regarding', 'best', 'course', 'action', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'when', 'frontier', 'doctor', 'dress', 'hand', 'wound', 'suffered', 'Le', 'Boeuf', 'Mattie', 'when', 'doctor', 'examination', 'washing', 'hands.While', 'great', 'deal', 'actions', 'typical', 'video', 'westerns', 'one', 'made', 'unique', 'Darby', 'Mattie', 'character', 'Westerns', 'are', 'rarely', 'known', 'dialog', 'case', 'quality', 'dialog', 'delivery', 'raised', 'level', 'movie', 'Academy', 'Award', 'level']",N/A

123466,A1C58YXM2A30CY,0792107128,,"[0, 2]","True Grit is a stylized Western about a girl (Matty Ross, played with conviction by Kim Darby) who loves her father very much.  He left behind his wife and children and rode out with another man on some business.  Sometime during a card game this man, Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), got drunk.  The father showed the man out who then brandished a rifle.  While trying to get the gun away, Tom fired, killing her father, and ran off into the woods.I can certainly see how this could be upsetting for this girl but she goes through so much!  Although she tries to be calm and insistent about getting her way, it's more interesting where her barrier cracks -- when she witnesses a hanging, when she sees her dad in a pine box -- and when she sees her apparent savior, in the form of Rooster Cogburn, (rough tough, and all John Wayne) betray her trust (again, apparently).  It's just too much.Great story!  It was fun to see this late sixties Western at a time when the western as a genre was beginning to wane.  Television was full of westerns then, and they were all going off the air -- The Virginian, Gunsmoke, Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, etc., etc.John Wayne epitomized all these gun-toting tough guys. But what was different about John Wayne's portrayal from these gentlemen was his willingness to break the rules to get what he wanted, whether it be a criminal, another bottle of whiskey, or saving a girl from a pit of rattlers, no matter what!  And Robert Duval as the bad guy -- great acting!And our girl, played by Kim Darby, was the same.  ""She reminds me -- of me!""The story moves at a quick pace after a bit of a slow start.  The girl meets a Texas ranger and doesn't think much of him -- played by crooner Glen Campbell.  I've never liked Glen, then or now.  His stilted acting was a bit much.  But his portrayal of a man who wanted nothing to do with this girl and giving her a good spanking -- this was realistic if unsettling.Overall, True Grit is a western, one with real human experience, some conflict, lots of gun action and horse-riding.  A girl who wants revenge, a man who wants justice.  A great example of the wild western justice, a bit Hollywood-ized, and fun to watch!Great film!  I have yet to watch the current remake (2011) and look forward to a comparison when I check it out.Cast & Crew:The director is Henry Hathaway, maker of such hits as How The West Was Won (1962)How the West Was Won (Three-Disc Special Edition), and Mae West's Go West, Young Man (1936)GO WEST YOUNG MANamong many American westerns over his 40 plus year career!It was surprising to me how many of the secondary characters have also appeared in the original Star Trek.  Even Kim Darby was in a Star Trek episode (Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 12: Miri [VHS])Check the cast list and look it up on Wikipedia.  Amazing!* John Wayne as Reuben J.

123467,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,0792107128,,"[0, 3]","True Grit was a film when I first saw it I didn't like.  I thought it was dumb because of the main character who, by contrary to what a lot of people think, is Kim Darby.  John Wayne is not the main character, he is the big name in the film, he is the character that defines this movie and makes it what it is, but he isn't the character you end up following.  You follow Kim Darby from beginning to end, not John Wayne.  Wayne doesn't enter the movie until twenty minutes into it.  Although one would think this as a bad thing, it actually turns into a good thing.True Grit is and isn't an ordinary John Wayne western.  It has his style in it, but the character Wayne plays is so very much enjoyable.  How could you not like Rooster Cogburn?  The character has personality, wisdom, yet with obvious weakness, and typical John Wayne grit.  Cogburn is a drunkard, who is blundering, yet trustworthy.  It's this trust we feel in his character that allows us to forgive his character's sorry state (or in lamen's terms: when he's drunk).Kim Darby almost steals the show from Wayne, but she doesn't.  They instead create a balance, with a conflict between two personalities both different yet alike.  Mattie Ross is her character and she is very precise, observant, demanding, stubborn and a natural take charge kinda gal.  I like this personality of hers, it's so much refreshing from a lot of other female leads that are only in the movie for pathetic love interests.Glen Campbell is also in this film, and although I didn't care much for his character, he is sort of the dork of the film, not Darby.  Campbell is often the brunt of many remarks and cracks from Cogburn or Ross, which makes me laugh.  I'm fine with his character because he's full of flaws like the other two characters, there's nothing macho about him, his character is believable, which works for me.True Grit has plenty of humor, but also drama.  I love this mixture of emotion, and it is so very apparent in Mattie Ross.  Her character's purpose is to hunt down the man who shot and murdered her father, and although it is an emotional time for her and she is very determined to find him, she still remains in character the entire film.  With Rooster Cogburn it's the same deal, he's hilarious one moment but full of drama and grit the next.  This is character development.The plot is solid, although some of the shoot outs are a little unrealistic, such as Cogburn's famous charge at the end, it doesn't really matter.  It's a story about the hunting down of a murderer and the grit and determination of a daughter and a U.S. Marshall to bring him to justice.My only complaint about this film is the scenery.  This takes place in Missouri or in Texas, and yet this thing was filmed in Oregon.  Obviously, there is a huge difference between Texas land from Oregon land.  Mountains and forests and clean looking rivers are not aspects of Texas, trust me.  So that's a little incorrect.This is now my favorite western, and my earlier perception of it has changed very much because now I understand Darby's character a whole lot better and I can see how she adds to this film.  You want to see this film.  You need to see this film if you are a Western lover.Grade: A+",5,True Grit has real grit,1062201600,"08 30, 2003",2003,3234,"['True', 'Grit', 'was', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'thought', 'was', 'dumb', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'contrary', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'big', 'name', 'film', 'character', 'movie', 'what', ""n't"", 'character', 'end', 'up', 'following', 'follow', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'beginning', 'end', 'not', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Wayne', ""n't"", 'enter', 'movie', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'bad', 'thing', 'actually', 'good', 'thing.True', 'Grit', ""n't"", 'ordinary', 'John', 'Wayne', 'western', 'style', 'character', 'Wayne', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyable', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'character', 'personality', 'wisdom', 'yet', 'obvious', 'weakness', 'typical', 'John', 'Wayne', 'grit', 'Cogburn', 'drunkard', 'who', 'blundering', 'yet', 'trustworthy', 'trust', 'feel', 'character', 'forgive', 'character', 'sorry', 'state', 'lamen', 'terms', 'when', 'drunk', '.Kim', 'Darby', 'almost', 'show', 'Wayne', ""n't"", 'instead', 'create', 'balance', 'conflict', 'two', 'personalities', 'different', 'yet', 'alike', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'character', 'very', 'precise', 'observant', 'demanding', 'stubborn', 'natural', 'take', 'charge', 'kinda', 'gal', 'personality', 'hers', 'so', 'much', 'refreshing', 'lot', 'other', 'female', 'leads', 'are', 'only', 'movie', 'pathetic', 'love', 'interests.Glen', 'Campbell', 'also', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'character', 'sort', 'dork', 'film', 'not', 'Darby', 'Campbell', 'often', 'brunt', 'many', 'remarks', 'cracks', 'Cogburn', 'Ross', ""'m"", 'fine', 'character', 'full', 'flaws', 'other', 'two', 'characters', 'nothing', 'macho', 'character', 'believable', 'me.True', 'Grit', 'plenty', 'humor', 'also', 'drama', 'love', 'mixture', 'emotion', 'so', 'very', 'apparent', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'character', 'purpose', 'hunt', 'down', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'father', 'emotional', 'time', 'very', 'determined', 'find', 'still', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'same', 'deal', 'hilarious', 'one', 'moment', 'full', 'drama', 'grit', 'next', 'character', 'development.The', 'plot', 'solid', 'shoot', 'outs', 'are', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'such', 'Cogburn', 'famous', 'charge', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'story', 'hunting', 'murderer', 'grit', 'determination', 'daughter', 'U.S.', 'Marshall', 'bring', 'justice.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'scenery', 'place', 'Missouri', 'Texas', 'yet', 'thing', 'was', 'filmed', 'Oregon', 'Obviously', 'huge', 'difference', 'Texas', 'land', 'Oregon', 'land', 'Mountains', 'forests', 'clean', 'looking', 'rivers', 'are', 'not', 'aspects', 'Texas', 'trust', 'little', 'incorrect.This', 'now', 'favorite', 'western', 'earlier', 'perception', 'changed', 'very', 'much', 'now', 'understand', 'Darby', 'character', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'need', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'Western', 'lover.Grade', 'A+']",N/A

He won his only Oscar for his larger-than-life portrayal of the drunken, overweight, and completely fearless one-eyed Marshal, Rooster Cogburn.  It's not hard to tell that Glen Campbell is an amateur when it comes to acting, but he in no way ruins the film.  Kim Darby is terrific as Mattie Ross, the little spitfire girl who gives even the Duke almost more than he can handle.Robert Duvall and Strother Martin almost steal the show themselves as villians you'll love to hate.  Although Duvall's character does expose a sensitive side near the end of the film, he is still an outlaw, and his thirst for revenge against Cogburn ultimately gets the best of him.Campbell's character suggests the brash, arrogant, inexperienced macho man who is really more talk than walk, while Darby's character is defiant even in the face of pure evil.  In this respect, the two characters are a bad complement, but that's precisely why they are so entertaining.  The many confrontations and disagreements that Campbell and Darby's characters have throughout the film even provide a bit of comic relief to the Duke's hard-lined, albeit amazing, performance.All in all, if you want a movie with larger-than-life heroes, villains that are dirtier than a sandbox after a rainstorm, and just a bunch of great actors in a great movie, look no further.

Whether it was or not, it was the one for which he received his only Best Actor Academy Award.Regardless of the debate, TRUE GRIT is an entertaining western saga that showcases Wayne's considerable acting abilities to a tee.  Wayne stars as Rooster Cogburn, a no-nonsense bounty hunter who is renowned for invariably getting his man.  Kim Darby is perfectly cast as the straight-laced, prudish Mattie Ross, a spinsterish woman who hires Cogburn and a Texas Ranger (played by Glen Campbell and no, he can't act worth spit!) to hunt down the man who murdered her father.  But., hey, you already know the story!For me Wayne's best performance was as Ethan Edwards in John Ford's THE SEARCHERS.  For whatever reason Wayne was passed over for the Oscar for that performance.  Most agree that Wayne's Academy Award for TRUE GRIT  was a conglomerate for all of his great performances over the years.  That suits me.TRUE GRIT also stars a youngish Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper.  Duvall's line just prior to Wayne's signature scene in the movie--putting his reins in his teeth and taking on Pepper's gang single-handedly--is priceless.

The natural scenery is wonderful.  Plus, the beginning of the film is a splendid evocation of American Victorianism--with the funeral parlor, court house, boarding house, etc.The representation of post-bellum middle-southern America is excellently drawn.  (The locale is supposed to be Arkansas.  There is mention of Yankees and Texicans, etc.)Glenn Campbell was not an actor at all, but he was a good fellow and a nice folk singer of the 1960s, closely identified with Texas.  (He sings the title song.)Great supporting cast with Robert Duval and Jeff Corey.  The two scenes with Strother Martin are worth the price of admission alone.  Probably this is John Wayne's best rle.The sound track score by Elmer Bernstein is very fine; and as mentioned, the scenic cinematography is excellent.

123484,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,0792107128,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[9, 10]","When discussing fondly remembered films, the 1969 western ""True Grit"" certainly ranks somewhere near the top-10. This is not to say ""True Grit"" is one of the greatest westerns ever made - it's not - nor one of John Wayne's greatest films - it's not. But let's not get lost just yet. A sanitized though faithful adaptation of Charles Portis's brilliantly succinct and humorous novel (True Grit), it is perhaps best known as the film that gave the Duke a glorious opportunity to finally win the Oscar. He does not disappoint. As Rooster Cogburn, the cantankerous one-eyed Marshall who loves to ""pull a cork,"" Wayne chews the scenery and rings every bell. It would have been difficult for him to miss the mark. Wayne not only hits the target, but every year of his vast experience is utilized, a skilled iconic professional with just enough salt to slam the home run.Wayne went on record to say his finest moment of acting was the famous campfire scene when Rooster discusses his past, most notably as owner of a restaurant ""The Green Frog."" It's an incredible passage, sparked by the howling of nearby wolves, that resonates as a memorable snapshot. So much of my personal memory of this film is intertwined with viewing it with my family at the drive-in. To this day I recall the adult laughter, applause and intense enjoyment. And who doesn't feel goosebumps when Wayne - err Rooster - rides into the clearing and faces down Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall)?Like Wayne, director Henry Hathaway was rapidly approaching the end of a robust career often spent in the sticks filming oaters. And like the Duke, Henry still had just enough muscle to bring this film home (he had previously directed the excellent westernNevada Smithin 1966). He knew what he had and how to film it, taking full advantage of a glorious Colorado landscape (that's supposed to be Oklahoma, but it's obviously not). Every scene glistens, and he knew exactly where to place his performers for full affect. Ultimately, he paints an old-fashioned Hollywood canvas, expensively accented with the extraordinary musical score of Elmer Bernstein (True Grit [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]) and artistic cinematography of Lucien Ballard, the end result an antique genre scrapbook colored gold with lantern light. ""True Grit"" trots through the land of myth rather than revisionism popular at the time.After the murder of her father by the evil Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), young teenager Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) hires U.S. Marshall Cogburn to track him down in the wilds of the Indian territories. They are joined on their adventure by Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Glen Campbell) and ride dramatically through breath-taking vistas hoping to stumble upon Chaney and his colorful comrades. There are a handful of wonderful performances here, including Wayne, Darby, a young Duvall and even Strother Martin as a frustrated horse trader. Campbell, a likably talented songwriter, is sadly not up to the task. With all of the storied character actors available at this time - James Caan, Gene Hackman, George Kennedy, Warren Oates - filmmakers decided upon Campbell?! His stiff portrayal in a crucial role substantially weakens the film. Wayne had a peculiar habit of insisting upon popular singers to play supporting roles (Ricky Nelson, Frankie Avalon, Bobby Vinton). Blame him when uncovering one of the reasons ""True Grit"" does not achieve true greatness.I revisit ""True Grit"" often when in a sentimental mood, enjoying it's nostalgic allure. Wayne had made three terrible films in a row (""The War Wagon,""The Green Berets,Hellfighters) and the unique magnificence of ""True Grit"" re-energized a fruitful twilight career for this famous American emblem. Some of those final films were good (The Train Robbers,The Shootist), some not (Big Jake,McQ), and there was even enough time for the mediocre sequelRooster Cogburn (...and the Lady).

The Duke is in his element as a crotchety, ""shoot-first, ask-questions-later"", US Marshall who is hired by Mattie Ross to find the killer of her father.  Helping with the search of the murderer Tom Chaney is Campbell as a young, still ""wet-behind-the-ears"" Texas Ranger who wants Chaney for the murder of a State Senator in Texas.While starting just a little slow for a Wayne Western, the film picks up steam as the trio head into ""Indian Country"" to find Chaney.  Along the way, Director Henry Hathaway develops each of the characters and binds them together.  Darby is terrific as the prim and proper young Ross who is wise beyond years and will be nobody's fool.  Campbell, while somewhat stiff as the Texas Ranger, holds his own in the shadow of The Duke.The supporting cast is outstanding led by Robert Duvall (as Lucky Ned Pepper), Strother Martin, Jeremy Slade and Dennis Hopper (in all too small of a role).  The scenery (even if it's not Oklahoma) and cinematography are spectacular.  The ending is satisfying and heartfelt.  And while the DVD contains nothing in the way of extras and the sound is basically mono, this is one movie that you can watch with the whole family and feel good about.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR JOHN WAYNE AND ALL WESTERN FANS",5,The Duke's Academy Award winning performance!,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,1439,"['True', 'Grit', 'starring', 'John', 'Wayne', 'US', 'Marshall', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'LeBeouf', 'classic', 'western', 'suited', 'ages', 'Duke', 'element', 'crotchety', 'shoot-first', 'ask-questions-later', 'US', 'Marshall', 'who', 'hired', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'find', 'killer', 'father', 'Helping', 'search', 'murderer', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Campbell', 'young', 'still', 'wet-behind-the-ears', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'who', 'Chaney', 'murder', 'State', 'Senator', 'Texas.While', 'starting', 'just', 'little', 'slow', 'Wayne', 'Western', 'film', 'up', 'steam', 'trio', 'head', 'Indian', 'Country', 'find', 'Chaney', 'way', 'Director', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'characters', 'together', 'Darby', 'terrific', 'prim', 'proper', 'young', 'Ross', 'who', 'wise', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'nobody', 'fool', 'Campbell', 'somewhat', 'stiff', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'own', 'shadow', 'Duke.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'led', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Jeremy', 'Slade', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'too', 'small', 'role', 'scenery', 'even', 'not', 'Oklahoma', 'cinematography', 'are', 'spectacular', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'heartfelt', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'way', 'extras', 'sound', 'basically', 'mono', 'one', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'whole', 'family', 'feel', 'good', 'about.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'FOR', 'JOHN', 'WAYNE', 'AND', 'ALL', 'WESTERN', 'FANS']",N/A

In that sense I would call ""True Grit"" a minor disappointment.  For sure John Wayne delivers a flamboyant and energetic turn as Rooster Cogburn in a role tailored to his particular strengths.  But I couldn't help to think he was so much better in films like ""The Searchers"", ""Red River"" and his final film, ""The Shootist"".  I'm reminded of when they finally rewarded Paul Newman after years of solid work it had to be for an OK performance in ""The Color of Money"".  That said, on the whole ""True Grit"" is a good rousing western that falls just shy of greatness.  Maybe a little formulaic but so what if it works.  The film is skillfully directed by western vet Henry Hathaway and beautifully lensed by Peckinpah stalwart Lucien Ballard.  Kim Darby playing younger than her years Mattie Ross, a feisty girl who contracts Cogburn to find the killer of her father, is beguiling.  Glen Campbell is better than expected as a Texas Ranger who forms a begrudging alliance with Cogburn to find the killer.  Excellent supporting cast includes Jeff Corey, John Fiedler, Robert Duvall and the inimitable Strother Martin.

Instead of a typical plastic case, the movie arrives in something more &#34;collectible&#34; or interesting, a tin box, or steel box, some might say a &#34;keepsake,&#34; emblazoned with the glossy material normally part of a typical DVD or BluRay package.  Especially as there was no obvious added cost, we like it a lot!  Probably would have paid more for this packaging, but we're certainly not going to tell the studios that!The film itself is terrific, filmed near Telluride, Colorado, the ski resort where we live and work -- mostly in Ridgway, partly in nearby Ouray, both of which are very special little towns near Telluride, easy day trip using Telluride as &#34;base camp&#34; to see them both and immerse yourselves in the genuine locations for an iconic film.John Wayne finally got an Oscar for this film, and his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn, U.S. Marshal.  The bad guys include a young Robert Duvall, and a young Dennis Hopper, both are terrific in the film, and add real interest for film buffs.The long views of the San Juan mountain range, mostly from Hastings Mesa above Telluride and Ridgway, are unforgettable, and easily attainable by travellers today, looks just the same, by visiting our area of Southwest Colorado.And I can't remember John Wayne in a more appealing role, although it's certainly worth seeing his performance, along with Ron Howard, and Lauren Bacall, in &#34;The Shootist&#34;;  if you haven't seen that one, you should.  Mighty fine, and I believe, John Wayne's last film.Kim Darby is on BluRay extras in interviews, great to see her after all these years;  she plays the female lead, a young woman with plenty of her own &#34;true grit&#34; seeking justice for the senseless murder of her father.The great singing star Glen Campbell also has a leading role, on the trail of the murderer along with John Wayne and Kim Darby.  Glen is interviewed too;  very touching, particularly in light of recent diagnosis of Alzheimer's and the end of Glen Campbell's touring career.  Panned by critics at the time, Glen is just fine as a Texas Ranger.  But more important: his stunning singing on the title track, i.e., &#34;True Grit&#34; which is played over the opening credits.  I confess, as a kid, I saw the movie more than once in theaters just to hear Glen sing the title song.  (Not on albums at the time, we recently found it on a terrific CD purchased here on amazon, &#34;The Essential Glen Campbell,&#34; check it out!)  This was Glen in his prime;  the version in the movie is slightly different than the one on the CD, but both are great.  To me, as a kid, and a budding musician, hearing this was literally worth the price of admission in the movies.  In his interview, Glen comments what a thrill it was to ride alongside the great John Wayne in a western.  How many of us, when we were young, imagined just the same thing?  For Glen, from Delight, Arkansas, a dream come true.The exterior of the general store in this film with period advertising in the custom of the day is now the interior wall of the True Grit Caf&eacute;, a popular restaurant and bar in Ridgway, CO, so movie fans will have fun &#34;connecting the dots&#34; and seeing this, and the town, and Ouray just a few miles up the road, in person sometime.  Great fun for the whole family.Highly recommended.

123493,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0792107128,Dr. James Gardner,"[8, 11]","If you had enough money to buy only one version of ""True Grit"", which one should you buy? Both are based on the 1968 Saturday Evening Post serial by Charles Portis, and for the most part, the main points in both films are identical - 14 year old Mattie Ross hires aging, drunken, one-eyed Deputy U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn to hunt down evil Tom Chaney, the man who killed her father. Along the way they are joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, make their way into Indian Territory where Chaney has teamed up with Ned Pepper and his gang, old nemeses of Cogburn.The 1969 version starred John Wayne with Kim Darby, Glen Campbell, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, and Jeff Corey. The 2010 version has Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfeld, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper.Clearly the 1969 version has the more powerful cast.The 1969 version was directed by Henry Hathaway and the 2010 version is directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Hathaway and Wayne worked together on several films, including ""Shepherd of the Hills"" (1941), ""North to Alaska"" (1960), and ""Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965). Hathaway specialized in westerns from his earliest films - ""Heritage of the Desert"" (1932), ""Wild Horse Mesa"" (1932) - to his later films - ""Shootout"" (1971), ""5 Card Stud"" (1968), yet curiously enough his only nomination for an Oscar was for ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), and his best known films are non-Westerns (e.g., ""Of Human Bondage"", ""Call Northside 777"", ""The Desert Fox""). He once said ""To be a good director you've got to be a bastard. I'm a bastard and I know it.""The Coen Brothers have written and/or directed nearly two dozen films and amassed a list of Oscar nominations and wins that is more than impressive. ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007) won Oscars for Directing, Writing, and Best Picture. ""Fargo"" (1996) won for Best Writing and was nominated for Best Director and Best Editing. They also wrote and directed ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" (2000) and ""Miller's Crossing"" (1990) which I personally think are better films, but didn't receive the same critical reception.The director's race is a close one, because they are so different and so separated in time. My nod to Hathaway in the western genre, which is by no means a negative assessment of the Coen's work.The 1969 version was a vehicle for Wayne, while the 2010 version sticks more closely to the original story. As such, the remake is more entertaining, authentic, and interesting.The 1969 version was photographed by Lucien Ballard. Ballard was a favorite of Sam Peckinpah and lensed some of the finest westerns ever made, including ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) and ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). He also worked extensively with Hathaway and with B western producer Budd Boetticher. He received one Oscar nomination for his work on ""The Caretakers"" (1963). Roger Deakins is the cinematographer for the 2010 version. Deakins has worked on more than half of the Coen Brothers films, including ""Fargo"", ""O Brother..."", and ""No Country..."" He accumulated 8 Oscar nominations but no wins.Deakins is an excellent cinematographer, but IMHO Lucien Ballard's work was mythic. The nod goes to the 1969 version.The main question on everyone's lips - How does Bridges compare to Wayne and how does Darby compare with Steinfeld? Jeff Bridges does an excellent job, although at times he appears to lose some of Cogburn's affectations. Wayne, of course, won his only Oscar for his role and he gets my nod, not only for his performance per se, but for the body of work in westerns.Darby vs. Steinfeld? Again, they both give great performances. Personally I prefer Darby's interpretation, and her boyishness seems to fit the story better.Matt Damon most assuredly gives a much better performance than Glen Campbell.  Jeff Corey gave a good performance as Tom Chaney as does Josh Brolin in the 2010 version. Barry Pepper as Ned Pepper seems to be channeling Robert Duval, even to the inflections in his voice.If this review seemingly favors the 1969 version, it's not an indictment of the 2010 version but recognition that the people working on the 1969 version were accomplished makers of westerns, whereas the people involved in the 2010 version are good story tellers, but not necessarily of the western genre.Most great films have a final scene that remains with us long after the details are forgotten. From Edward Robinson's lament at the end of ""Little Caesar"" or Brett's farewell to Scarlett, or Wayne's silhouette in the doorway at the end of ""The Searchers"", we recall the film partly as a result of the powerful ending. In this category, the original is so far superior to the remake that one wonders what possessed the filmmakers to  close on the scenes they chose. No one really wants to remember Rooster as a tired old showman, listed fourth on the bill of a travelling troop. Our mythology demands that he be the fat old man who can jump a four rail fence.Each generation remakes a film to suit their needs. Back in the 60s and 70s we needed a strong hero, whether he be called Spartacus, Rocky,  James Bond, or Superman. But the ethos has changed. James T Kirk morphed into an ensemble of Star Treks, Superman faded for the Fantastic Four and the X-men, Sylvester Stallonne now makes ""The Expendables"", and even J. Edgar Hoover disappeared behind the committee doors with names like Homeland Security, NSA, and TSA.

123497,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0792107128,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","TRUE GRIT (1969), from the novel by Charles Portis published in 1968, was a paradigm-shift in the way we watch film and the way films are shot. (How I hate the word ""paradigm"" and the term ""shot"" in reference to film.) The lush and healthy outdoors locations, Yellowstone National Park among them, and the super-detailed outdoor sets added to the genuine flavor hitherto unrealized in Westerns.Naturally, the story has that elegant simplicity of the classic: a young teen Arkansas girl from out in the country pursues her father's murderer with the help of a grizzled old marshal. This is Charles Portis we're talking about here, and he is the master of subtle comic writing as well as an ex-Marine from Arkansas. Portis is a writer of orderliness, so aside from the wickedly colorful villain Tom Cheney (ohh, Dick Cheney's grandfather?--here spelled ""Chaney"", played by bit player Jeff Corey) whom they all are pursuing, there are yin/yang characters.Into the story steps handsome Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Glenn Campbell, ohhh, Shia's great-grandfather?) who is pursing our ex-vice president's grandpa for the murder of a Texas senator. He throws in with young Mattie (played by the reputedly vicious Kim Darby, an old Disney Studios player). Marshal Ruben ""Rooster"" Cogburn (John Wayne) is irritated but amused at La Boeuf's presence.An early and poignant bit part, Moon, is expertly offered by the late and sorely missed Dennis Hopper; Alfred Ryder (as defense attorney Mr. Goudy who has a hilarious courtroom exchange with Rooster), Strother Martin and the incomparable John Fiedler (immortal voice of Piglet) round out the talent on display. I was very taken with Judge Isaac Parker (James Westerfield) and his courtroom; also by his famous black bailiff played by James McEachin. Jay Silverheels and Wilford Brimley make uncredited appearances here too. EVERYBODY was in this!Portis does not stop there--later in the story comes Lucky Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall), gang leader extraordinaire and Cogburn's old nemesis. The action is unparalleled and does great justice to the novel, with an exception: Mattie is about 14 years old and a 22-year-old Kim Darby was unwisely chosen to play this role. Allegedly, Wayne wanted his then-14-year-old daughter, Ayissa, to have the role. Ayissa was said to have cried for a week when informed that the role had gone to someone else...but Wayne bitched about it for years to come. And it is true that Darby was even-handedly nasty to every single person she encountered. Director Henry Hathaway was less frightened of rattlesnakes, he said, than of Kim Darby's filthy temper.Hathaway also had a great battle of the wills with Wayne on account of Rooster Cogburn's appearance: Portis modeled Cogburn after President Grover Cleveland, who weighed about 365 LBS. and sported a huge walrus moustache. Cogburn also wore an eyepatch. Wayne was so incensed about the makeup that he refused to wear any at all. It took Hathaway some serious bone-crunching just to get Wayne to agree to the eyepatch. On the bright side, Wayne was told not only to forget about his weight problem but to pack on some extra pounds, so in the end he happily agreed.The film got Oscars. More importantly, Wayne got his one and only for this role. It is a subtle, hilarious and profound portrayal that some people believe was Wayne lampooning himself. I do not see it that way: John Wayne had a flair for ""camera acting"" and was well aware of the camera's presence. This, combined with his true talents, make Rooster Cogburn his most unforgettable character of all, and one of the undisputed Western icons. And Wayne was worried all along that audiences wouldn't recognize him!This film cannot be done any more justice than I did here. It is rich and innovative, inspired by the original novel, and makes all earlier Westerns fall flat. It has inspired and informed every Western that has been made since, and Brendan Gleason's (a/k/a Gleeson) portrayal of Alastair ""Mad-eye"" Moody in HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is an obvious homage to Wayne's Cogburn.",5,I oughta paddle yer rump!!,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,4073,"['TRUE', 'GRIT', '1969', 'novel', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'published', '1968', 'was', 'paradigm-shift', 'way', 'watch', 'film', 'way', 'films', 'are', 'shot', 'How', 'hate', 'word', 'paradigm', 'term', 'shot', 'reference', 'film', 'lush', 'healthy', 'outdoors', 'locations', 'Yellowstone', 'National', 'Park', 'super-detailed', 'outdoor', 'sets', 'added', 'genuine', 'flavor', 'hitherto', 'unrealized', 'Westerns.Naturally', 'story', 'elegant', 'simplicity', 'classic', 'young', 'teen', 'Arkansas', 'girl', 'country', 'father', 'murderer', 'help', 'grizzled', 'old', 'marshal', 'Charles', 'Portis', ""'re"", 'talking', 'here', 'master', 'subtle', 'comic', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'ex-Marine', 'Arkansas', 'Portis', 'writer', 'orderliness', 'so', 'aside', 'wickedly', 'colorful', 'villain', 'Tom', 'Cheney', 'ohh', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'grandfather', 'here', 'spelled', 'Chaney', 'played', 'bit', 'player', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'whom', 'are', 'pursuing', 'are', 'yin/yang', 'story', 'handsome', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'La', 'Boeuf', 'Glenn', 'Campbell', 'ohhh', 'Shia', 'great-grandfather', 'who', 'pursing', 'ex-vice', 'president', 'grandpa', 'murder', 'Texas', 'senator', 'young', 'Mattie', 'played', 'reputedly', 'vicious', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'old', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'player', 'Marshal', 'Ruben', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'John', 'Wayne', 'irritated', 'amused', 'La', 'Boeuf', 'presence.An', 'early', 'poignant', 'bit', 'part', 'Moon', 'expertly', 'offered', 'late', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Alfred', 'Ryder', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Mr.', 'Goudy', 'who', 'hilarious', 'courtroom', 'exchange', 'Rooster', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'incomparable', 'John', 'Fiedler', 'immortal', 'voice', 'Piglet', 'round', 'out', 'talent', 'display', 'was', 'very', 'taken', 'Judge', 'Isaac', 'Parker', 'James', 'Westerfield', 'courtroom', 'also', 'famous', 'black', 'bailiff', 'played', 'James', 'McEachin', 'Jay', 'Silverheels', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'make', 'uncredited', 'appearances', 'here', 'too', 'EVERYBODY', 'was', 'Portis', 'not', 'stop', 'there', 'later', 'story', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'gang', 'leader', 'extraordinaire', 'Cogburn', 'old', 'nemesis', 'action', 'unparalleled', 'great', 'justice', 'novel', 'exception', 'Mattie', '14', 'years', 'old', '22-year-old', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'was', 'unwisely', 'chosen', 'play', 'role', 'Allegedly', 'Wayne', 'wanted', 'then-14-year-old', 'daughter', 'Ayissa', 'have', 'role', 'Ayissa', 'was', 'said', 'have', 'cried', 'week', 'when', 'informed', 'role', 'had', 'gone', 'someone', 'else', 'Wayne', 'bitched', 'years', 'come', 'true', 'Darby', 'was', 'even-handedly', 'nasty', 'single', 'person', 'encountered', 'Director', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'was', 'less', 'frightened', 'rattlesnakes', 'said', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'filthy', 'temper.Hathaway', 'also', 'had', 'great', 'battle', 'wills', 'Wayne', 'account', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'appearance', 'Portis', 'modeled', 'Cogburn', 'President', 'Grover', 'Cleveland', 'who', 'weighed', '365', 'LBS', 'sported', 'huge', 'walrus', 'moustache', 'Cogburn', 'also', 'wore', 'eyepatch', 'Wayne', 'was', 'so', 'incensed', 'makeup', 'refused', 'wear', 'took', 'Hathaway', 'serious', 'bone-crunching', 'just', 'get', 'Wayne', 'agree', 'eyepatch', 'bright', 'side', 'Wayne', 'was', 'told', 'not', 'only', 'forget', 'weight', 'problem', 'pack', 'extra', 'pounds', 'so', 'end', 'happily', 'film', 'got', 'Oscars', 'More', 'importantly', 'Wayne', 'got', 'one', 'only', 'role', 'subtle', 'hilarious', 'profound', 'portrayal', 'people', 'believe', 'was', 'Wayne', 'lampooning', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'way', 'John', 'Wayne', 'had', 'flair', 'camera', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'camera', 'presence', 'combined', 'true', 'talents', 'make', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'one', 'undisputed', 'Western', 'icons', 'Wayne', 'was', 'worried', 'audiences', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'more', 'justice', 'did', 'here', 'rich', 'innovative', 'inspired', 'original', 'novel', 'earlier', 'Westerns', 'fall', 'flat', 'inspired', 'informed', 'Western', 'been', 'made', 'Brendan', 'Gleason', 'Gleeson', 'portrayal', 'Alastair', 'Mad-eye', 'Moody', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'AND', 'THE', 'GOBLET', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'obvious', 'homage', 'Wayne', 'Cogburn']",N/A
123498,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0792107128,Erik North,"[4, 5]","The man's politics aside, you've still gotta love him. Very true.For decades, John Wayne was the absolute definition of a Hollywood star, especially when it came to Westerns. Whether working for John Ford, Howard Hawks, Henry Hathaway, and later Burt Kennedy and Andrew McLaglen, he defined what it was like to be in the saddle. STAGECOACH; RED RIVER; RIO BRAVO; THE SEARCHERS; THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, and dozens of others, defined the man they called ""The Duke."" And towards the twilight of his career, he came up with one of his most memorable roles, as Rooster Cogubrn, in Hathaway's 1969 old-school western TRUE GRIT.Loosely spoofing the iconic image he had built up over the previous thirty years, Wayne's Rooster Cogburn is an aging, hard-drinking, paunchy marshal who gets hired on by a teenage girl named Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) to find an ex-employee (Jeff Corey) who shot and killed her father. Together, with a very green Texas ranger (Glen Campbell), they not only go after Corey (who after all is Darby's to kill), but come across Corey's gang, led by ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall, in a great villain role, where he goads the Duke into a fight with the line ""I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man!""). In the meantime, despite all the behind-the-scenes infighting (Wayne being thoroughly unimpressed by Darby and nearly getting into it with Duvall), Darby, Wayne, and Campbell build up something resembling camaraderie. All of this, and fabulous on-location shooting in Colorado, central California, and some done near Durango, Mexico (where the Duke owned a little bit of land for years), courtesy of Lucien Ballard, plus an Elmer Bernstein score featuring Campbell's title song.One can argue whether or not Wayne's performance was really all that Oscar worthy, given the competition in '69 that included Richard Burton, Jon Voight, and Dustin Hoffman; after all, the man had survived one lung being removed only five years before, and sentimentality may have been involved. And one could make the case for THE SEARCHERS, or even Ford's non-western 1952 classic THE QUIET MAN, as being more representative of Wayne as an actor. But as square and set in his ways as he was, there's no doubt that Wayne gave it his all for his old director friend Hathaway. Darby and Campbell, despite showing their inexperience, do good enough in their respective roles alongside the Duke; and besides Duvall's villainous role, there is a delicious irony in seeing Dennis Hopper here as well (at the same time TRUE GRIT came out, he and Peter Fonda were rocking down the American highway in EASY RIDER, the complete antithesis of the super-patriotism that Wayne's career embodied). And one can't help but make mention of the persnickety horse trader Colonel G. Stonehill portrayed by the always memorable and legendary character actor Strother Martin.Coming out in the same year that radically different westerns like THE WILD BUNCH, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, and BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID appeared on the scene, TRUE GRIT was defiantly old-fashioned (and probably seems even more so today, as the Coen Brothers' reworking is getting accolades). Still, as a vehicle for an actor who embodied so much of America and the West for so long, despite his politics (or because of them), there's a reason why it has lasted, and that is John Wayne himself.",4,"""Fill Your Hand, You Son Of A B**ch!""--The Original TRUE GRIT",1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,3377,"['man', 'politics', 'aside', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'Very', 'true.For', 'decades', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'absolute', 'definition', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'especially', 'when', 'came', 'Westerns', 'Whether', 'working', 'John', 'Ford', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'later', 'Burt', 'Kennedy', 'Andrew', 'McLaglen', 'defined', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'saddle', 'STAGECOACH', 'RED', 'RIVER', 'RIO', 'BRAVO', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'SHOT', 'LIBERTY', 'VALANCE', 'dozens', 'others', 'defined', 'man', 'called', 'Duke', 'towards', 'twilight', 'career', 'came', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'roles', 'Rooster', 'Cogubrn', 'Hathaway', '1969', 'old-school', 'western', 'TRUE', 'GRIT.Loosely', 'spoofing', 'iconic', 'image', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'previous', 'thirty', 'years', 'Wayne', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'aging', 'hard-drinking', 'paunchy', 'marshal', 'who', 'hired', 'teenage', 'girl', 'named', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'find', 'ex-employee', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'who', 'shot', 'killed', 'father', 'Together', 'very', 'green', 'Texas', 'ranger', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'not', 'only', 'go', 'Corey', 'who', 'Darby', 'kill', 'come', 'Corey', 'gang', 'led', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'great', 'villain', 'role', 'where', 'Duke', 'fight', 'line', 'call', 'bold', 'talk', 'one-eyed', 'fat', 'man', 'meantime', 'behind-the-scenes', 'infighting', 'Wayne', 'being', 'thoroughly', 'unimpressed', 'Darby', 'nearly', 'getting', 'Duvall', 'Darby', 'Wayne', 'Campbell', 'build', 'up', 'something', 'resembling', 'camaraderie', 'fabulous', 'on-location', 'shooting', 'Colorado', 'central', 'California', 'done', 'Durango', 'Mexico', 'where', 'Duke', 'owned', 'little', 'bit', 'land', 'years', 'courtesy', 'Lucien', 'Ballard', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'score', 'featuring', 'Campbell', 'title', 'song.One', 'can', 'argue', 'not', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'was', 'really', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'given', 'competition', 'included', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'man', 'had', 'survived', 'one', 'lung', 'being', 'removed', 'only', 'five', 'years', 'sentimentality', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'case', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'even', 'Ford', 'non-western', '1952', 'classic', 'THE', 'QUIET', 'MAN', 'being', 'more', 'representative', 'Wayne', 'actor', 'square', 'set', 'ways', 'was', 'doubt', 'Wayne', 'gave', 'old', 'director', 'friend', 'Hathaway', 'Darby', 'Campbell', 'showing', 'inexperience', 'do', 'good', 'enough', 'respective', 'roles', 'Duke', 'Duvall', 'villainous', 'role', 'delicious', 'irony', 'seeing', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'same', 'time', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'came', 'out', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'were', 'rocking', 'down', 'American', 'highway', 'EASY', 'RIDER', 'complete', 'antithesis', 'super-patriotism', 'Wayne', 'career', 'embodied', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'mention', 'persnickety', 'horse', 'trader', 'Colonel', 'G.', 'Stonehill', 'portrayed', 'always', 'memorable', 'legendary', 'character', 'actor', 'Strother', 'Martin.Coming', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'radically', 'different', 'westerns', 'THE', 'WILD', 'BUNCH', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'THE', 'WEST', 'BUTCH', 'CASSIDY', 'THE', 'SUNDANCE', 'KID', 'appeared', 'scene', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'was', 'defiantly', 'old-fashioned', 'probably', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'today', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'reworking', 'getting', 'accolades', 'Still', 'vehicle', 'actor', 'who', 'embodied', 'so', 'much', 'America', 'West', 'so', 'long', 'politics', 'reason', 'why', 'lasted', 'John', 'Wayne']",N/A

Paramount Home Entertainment has released the double-disc set as part of the studio's 100th-year Wayne promotion with Warner Home Video.The Duke plays one-eyed bounty hunter Rooster Cogburn. Valley girl Kim Darby plays a teen bent on avenging her father's death. Darby, who gives a sensational performance, stood toe-to-toe with Wayne onscreen and off, the bonus features note. Critics of the time thought Darby was in for a major league career, but she went on to a modest but long-running tenure in the business.The extras aren't deep, but the docu ""Working With the Duke"" does a decent job of positioning ""True Grit"" in Wayne's sunsetting career.

123501,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,0792107128,Gary P. Cohen,"[7, 8]","I remember seeing True Grit in the movies upon its original release.  I walked in midway through the film.  (In those days most people just came walking in while the film was already on.)  The first scene I saw was of the Duke as Rooster Cogburn falling drunkenly off his horse.  It was at that point that I realized that this was a different Wayne western.  True Grit has never been my favorite Wayne western, I prefer several others like Rio Bravo, El Dorado, The Searchers, The Shootist, etc.  But it is the film that the Duke won the Oscar for, (I was quite overjoyed that night,) and for that, it  must be appreciated.  It goes without saying that Wayne was great here and deserved the award.  (He probably also deserved it for The Searchers and She Wore A Yellow Ribbon.)  However there are several other things that must be appreciated about this beautiful film.  One forgets how excellent Kim Darby was as Mattie Ross, the teenager who hires Cogburn to find her father's killers.  I keep hearing her unfavorably compared to the young actress who portrays the role in the remake, however she is terrific here.  True Grit is also loaded with up and coming stars and terrific character actors in small roles, this is almost never mentioned.  Among the actors appearing in supporting roles are Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Jeremy Slate, etc.I did not see the remake of this classic film (any more than I saw the remake of Psycho in 1998.)  I believe that if the film was done right the first time, why remake it?  I watched the film on blu-ray last Sunday in lieu of the Academy Awards, a program that I have not watched in years.  I enjoyed the film greatly.  The picture and sound quality were great.  There are also several short but excellent special features.  There is a segment where several of the actors are interviewed about working with the Duke: Kim Darby, Glen Campbell, the late Jeremy Slate, etc.  Theres another fine short about the locations where this film was made in Colorado.  We get to see the locations at the time of this film's production in 1969 and the same locations today.  Theres a segment on the film's script and another on the real life lawmen and outlaws of the west.  There is also an excellent vintage trailer.As stated, True Grit is an excellent western with a larger than life Oscar-winning performance by the great John Wayne.

A young girl, who demonstrates true grit and resilience throughout her adventure, seeks and finds a gunfighter who has true grit to capture the man who killed her father and bring him to her home State for hanging. She finds him in an aged, overweight, heavy-handed, fearless, poor, one-eyed deputy sheriff, who we see on one occasion falling off his horse drunk. As most people know, the film was originally made in the 1960s and was just redone.This earlier version is worth seeing. It is based on a book, which most reviewers realize is much better than the film. However, the film does capture much of the true wildness of the old west and the strangeness of its characters, and the scenery is outstanding. John Wayne received an Oscar for his performance. Opinions vary whether he received it because he deserved it for his performance in this movie, or for abandoning his usual heroic mode and allowing himself to be cast as an aged fat drunk, or that he was being rewarded for his decades of films. It seemed to me that it was a combination of all three. Wayne played Rooster as John Wayne playing Rooster, but he was good and it was a pleasure to watch him. Kim Darby was also good, perhaps a little wooden, but still good; in fact without her there is no story. She also added spark and humor to the tale.I am a fan of Glen Campbell's singing. I don't know why he stopped, and I miss his songs. However, I felt he was miscast in this movie. I felt that he did not deliver his lines well and did not even move well.

It's a shame he didn't get to more often.""True Grit"" benefits from a sharp script with a real feel for period dialogue... and some cranky characters with very individualistic points of view.  Of course, the Duke's Cogburn leads the way, but Kim Darby, in her film debut, fearlessly jousts with all comers and generally comes out ahead.  She's Cogburn's match in the grit department, headstrong and stubborn.  ""She reminds me of  me,"" Cogburn says with obvious glee as the girl daringly crosses a swiftly-moving river on horseback.  Duvall makes a redoubtable villian in his short screentime- not evil, exactly.  Just hardbitten and intent on pursuing crime, and strangely fatalistic.  Even with such well-observed characters, the film doesn't lack for Western action; it eschews gunfight cliches in favor of realism.  ...Gorgeously shot in authentic outdoors locations by director Henry Hathaway, ""True Grit"" also features an outstanding Elmer Bernstein score.  Even if you're a Western-hater, just focus on the characters and an excellent tale.  This is just flat-out a first-rate movie.Look for cameos by Jay Silverheels, Wilford Brimley, plus small roles well-played by Strother Martin and Jeff Corey (Wild Bill Hickock in ""Little Big Man"").",5,The Duke's best...,1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,1617,"['John', 'Wayne', 'Marshal', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'one-eyed', 'hard-drinking', 'straight-shooting', 'cantankerous', 'lawman', 'teamed', 'feisty', 'kid', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'conceited', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'bring', 'justice', 'one', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Wayne', 'won', 'much-deserved', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'guy', 'could', 'really', 'act', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'often', 'True', 'Grit', 'benefits', 'sharp', 'script', 'real', 'feel', 'period', 'dialogue', 'cranky', 'characters', 'very', 'individualistic', 'points', 'view', 'course', 'Duke', 'Cogburn', 'way', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'film', 'debut', 'fearlessly', 'comers', 'generally', 'out', 'ahead', 'Cogburn', 'match', 'grit', 'department', 'headstrong', 'stubborn', 'Cogburn', 'obvious', 'glee', 'girl', 'daringly', 'swiftly-moving', 'river', 'horseback', 'Duvall', 'redoubtable', 'villian', 'short', 'screentime-', 'not', 'evil', 'exactly', 'Just', 'hardbitten', 'intent', 'pursuing', 'crime', 'strangely', 'fatalistic', 'Even', 'such', 'well-observed', 'characters', 'film', ""n't"", 'lack', 'Western', 'action', 'gunfight', 'cliches', 'favor', 'realism', 'Gorgeously', 'shot', 'authentic', 'outdoors', 'locations', 'director', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'True', 'Grit', 'also', 'outstanding', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'score', 'Even', ""'re"", 'Western-hater', 'just', 'focus', 'characters', 'excellent', 'tale', 'just', 'flat-out', 'first-rate', 'movie.Look', 'cameos', 'Jay', 'Silverheels', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'small', 'roles', 'well-played', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickock', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man']",N/A

123517,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0792107128,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[8, 8]","I'm not a John Wayne aficionado, I've only seen a few of his films. I mention this because many reviewers of this film probably have a clearer idea of his career and body of work. In the few John Wayne films that I've seen, what I have noticed is what made him an icon. The larger-than-life screen persona, the drawling voice, the charisma, etc. Despite his forever iconic status, John Wayne won only a single Academy Award and that was for this film...And what a performance it is.Kim Darby stars as Mattie Ross, a strong-willed and sharp-tongued young girl whose father is killed by a man named Tom Chaney, who flees with her father's money. With Chaney hiding in Indian territory, out of reach of local authorities. Mattie becomes determined to bring him to justice. To assist her, she enlists the help of Deputy Marshal Rooster Cogburn, a one-eyed drunkard with an infamous reputation. In his four years as Deputy Marshal, Rooster has killed 23 men. After offering Rooster a substantial amount of money, Mattie and Rooster set off to catch Chaney, assisted by a Texas Ranger named La Boeuf (Glen Campbell), who's out to get Chaney for the murder of a Texas senator.Robert DuVall co-stars as ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper, a wanted outlaw believed to be associated with Chaney. Dennis Hopper also makes a brief appearance in the film.Forty years after it was originally released, True Grit is still one of the most revered and beloved western films of all time. Much of this can be credited to the presence of John Wayne, but this can also be accredited to the plot and, mores specifically, the characterization.This is no action-packed western film. Of course, there are several scenes with shoot-outs and varying action, but the film does not build itself on these characteristics but, rather, its characters. Its central characters can be called nothing less than three-dimensional. They're imperfect, drunken, annoying, hilarious, heroic, arrogant, and loveable.I found the characterization to be the strongest point of True Grit. But it's not just the writing that makes the character's so great; much of this goes to the actor's as well. The androgynous Darby nails the Mattie character in a completely convincing portrayal. Campbell is also slyly charming, showing much more depth than his iconic mugshot would lead you to believe. And then there's John Wayne; the real star of the show. Everytime he's on screen, he owns it. His larger-than-life presence and easy charm dominate everything. When Rooster is being cross-examined in a courtroom, drunkenly struggling to stay atop his house, or riding his horse with the reigns in his mouth while firing at four armed men he is absolutely believable. This is an iconic performance for a good reason.With great characters, greater acting, sharp, witty dialogue, and beautiful scenery throughout, True Grit is definitely worthy of seeking out.GRADE: B+",4,A Very Good Western That Lives Up To It's Reputation,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,2897,"[""'m"", 'not', 'John', 'Wayne', 'aficionado', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'few', 'films', 'mention', 'many', 'reviewers', 'film', 'probably', 'have', 'clearer', 'idea', 'career', 'body', 'work', 'few', 'John', 'Wayne', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'what', 'have', 'noticed', 'what', 'made', 'icon', 'larger-than-life', 'screen', 'persona', 'drawling', 'voice', 'charisma', 'etc', 'forever', 'iconic', 'status', 'John', 'Wayne', 'won', 'only', 'single', 'Academy', 'Award', 'was', 'film', 'what', 'performance', 'Darby', 'stars', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'strong-willed', 'sharp-tongued', 'young', 'girl', 'father', 'killed', 'man', 'named', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'who', 'father', 'money', 'Chaney', 'hiding', 'Indian', 'territory', 'reach', 'local', 'authorities', 'Mattie', 'becomes', 'determined', 'bring', 'justice', 'assist', 'help', 'Deputy', 'Marshal', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'one-eyed', 'drunkard', 'infamous', 'reputation', 'four', 'years', 'Deputy', 'Marshal', 'Rooster', 'killed', '23', 'men', 'offering', 'Rooster', 'substantial', 'amount', 'money', 'Mattie', 'Rooster', 'set', 'off', 'catch', 'Chaney', 'assisted', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'named', 'La', 'Boeuf', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'who', 'out', 'get', 'Chaney', 'murder', 'Texas', 'senator.Robert', 'DuVall', 'co-stars', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'wanted', 'outlaw', 'believed', 'be', 'associated', 'Chaney', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'also', 'brief', 'appearance', 'film.Forty', 'years', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'True', 'Grit', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'revered', 'beloved', 'western', 'films', 'time', 'Much', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'presence', 'John', 'Wayne', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'accredited', 'plot', 'mores', 'specifically', 'characterization.This', 'action-packed', 'western', 'film', 'course', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'shoot-outs', 'varying', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'build', 'characteristics', 'rather', 'characters', 'central', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'nothing', 'less', 'three-dimensional', ""'re"", 'imperfect', 'drunken', 'annoying', 'hilarious', 'heroic', 'arrogant', 'loveable.I', 'found', 'characterization', 'be', 'strongest', 'point', 'True', 'Grit', 'not', 'just', 'writing', 'character', 'so', 'great', 'much', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'androgynous', 'Darby', 'Mattie', 'character', 'completely', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'Campbell', 'also', 'slyly', 'charming', 'showing', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'iconic', 'mugshot', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'then', 'John', 'Wayne', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'Everytime', 'screen', 'larger-than-life', 'presence', 'easy', 'charm', 'dominate', 'everything', 'When', 'Rooster', 'being', 'cross-examined', 'courtroom', 'drunkenly', 'struggling', 'stay', 'house', 'riding', 'horse', 'reigns', 'mouth', 'firing', 'four', 'armed', 'men', 'absolutely', 'believable', 'iconic', 'performance', 'good', 'reason.With', 'great', 'characters', 'greater', 'acting', 'sharp', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'True', 'Grit', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'seeking', 'out.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

I was not disappointed.The story is of an Arkansas teenager named Matie Ross who hires drunken, trigger happy Marshal Rooster Cogburn to hunt down the outlaw who killed her dad.Firstly the acting was very good on the whole.  John Wayne's performance was excellent and superbly combined both humor and toughness.  This obviously invites a comparison with Jeff Bridge's portrayal in the remake.  That is a hard call because both did the Cogburn character superbly.  Perhaps John should get the benefit of the doubt simply because he did it first and set the benchmark.  I do prefer Haile Steinfield and Matt Damon as Ross and Ranger Lebeouf in the remake.  However I thought Kim Darby and Glen Campbell actually did those roles quite well in the original.  Close call between Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney and the actor playing him in the original.  Strother Martin, Dennis Hopper, and Robert Duvall all make appearances in the original as well so the casting was pretty good.The scenery (Rocky Mountains?) was excellent in conveying the grandness of the American West although I must confess it probably looks little like Arkansas or Oklahoma.  The Texas and New Mexico filming of the remake was probably closer to the actual setting.  Also the original seems to be filmed in autumn which is quite lovely aesthetically speaking but the remake was closer to the novel with its winter appearance.The muscial score in the original was adequate but sounded like that of your typical 1960s epic western.  The remakes's use of old hymns woven into the score was in my opinion more effective.I do kind of wander how True Grit got off with a G rating with the shootings, stabbings, hanging, and finger chopping.  I think PG would be more appropriate.Overall a very enjoyable western with a justly famous performance by John Wayne.  I may prefer the remake better overall but I heartily recommend both films (and the book) to western fans.",5,Great Western,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,2057,"['Having', 'Read', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'novel', 'watched', '2010', 'True', 'Grit', 'had', 'been', 'rather', 'anxious', 'see', 'famous', 'John', 'Wayne', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.The', 'story', 'Arkansas', 'teenager', 'named', 'Matie', 'Ross', 'who', 'drunken', 'happy', 'Marshal', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'hunt', 'down', 'outlaw', 'who', 'killed', 'dad.Firstly', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'whole', 'John', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'was', 'excellent', 'superbly', 'combined', 'humor', 'toughness', 'obviously', 'comparison', 'Jeff', 'Bridge', 'portrayal', 'remake', 'hard', 'call', 'did', 'Cogburn', 'character', 'superbly', 'Perhaps', 'John', 'should', 'get', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'simply', 'did', 'first', 'set', 'benchmark', 'do', 'prefer', 'Haile', 'Steinfield', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Ross', 'Ranger', 'Lebeouf', 'remake', 'However', 'thought', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'actually', 'did', 'roles', 'quite', 'well', 'original', 'Close', 'call', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'actor', 'playing', 'original', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'make', 'appearances', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'casting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'scenery', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', 'was', 'excellent', 'conveying', 'grandness', 'American', 'West', 'must', 'confess', 'probably', 'little', 'like', 'Arkansas', 'Oklahoma', 'Texas', 'New', 'Mexico', 'filming', 'remake', 'was', 'probably', 'closer', 'actual', 'setting', 'Also', 'original', 'be', 'filmed', 'autumn', 'quite', 'lovely', 'aesthetically', 'speaking', 'remake', 'was', 'closer', 'novel', 'winter', 'appearance.The', 'muscial', 'score', 'original', 'was', 'adequate', 'sounded', 'typical', '1960s', 'epic', 'western', 'remakes', 'use', 'old', 'hymns', 'woven', 'score', 'was', 'opinion', 'more', 'effective.I', 'do', 'kind', 'wander', 'how', 'True', 'Grit', 'got', 'off', 'G', 'rating', 'shootings', 'stabbings', 'hanging', 'finger', 'chopping', 'think', 'PG', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'western', 'justly', 'famous', 'performance', 'John', 'Wayne', 'may', 'prefer', 'remake', 'better', 'overall', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'films', 'book', 'western', 'fans']",N/A

At first he resists, but he needs the money and so he accepts the job.  Soon he is joined by a Texas ranger, played by Glen Campbell, who insists up going with him. So does Kim Darby who has to do some fine and fancy horse riding to catch up with the men and eventually convince them to take her along.Adventures abound for this trio and there is lots and lots of gunplay as they meet resistance from a wide variety of outlaws  including the young Dennis Hopper whose stellar performance hints at his greatness which is yet to come.  Casting is perfect and young Kim Darby, the strong-willed young woman with an attractive androgynous look and an overabundance of grit and gumption, eventually wins Wayne's respect.How this all turns out is not unexpected.  The good guys win and everyone else gets killed.  However, this is not a formulaic script and the acting and directing are exceptionally good.

He even crinkles his nose when he delivers his lines.The Coen brothers remake is very good but the script adheres very closely to the Charles Portis novel.The story is filled with old fashioned English and the tone is much darker.

The answer is, watch True Grit--it seems to show a little bit of every movie he was in.  Well, except for that one with the singing cowboy.If there ever was a finer western I have yet to see it.  Despite what people point out as flaws, the movie continues to be the greatest done by Wayne and many others.  I'm just glad they got people who could act.PROS:1.  Stars John Wayne, Glen Campbell (the singer) and Kim Darby (the cutie).  That's a star right there.2.  The music is almost perfect.3.  The acting almost perfect.4.  Shot mostly outside--lots of scenery shots--beautiful.5.  Great idea--imagine that, the story is actually about the little girl, John Wayne just pitches in to help.  Carried out nicely.six.  The language they speak.  I've heard some complaints about this, and I'm not a linguist, but it seems like I remember hearing all the contractions we use nowadays like Can't, Don't, Shouldn't, Couldn't -- and the list goes on-- did not exist one hundred and twenty years ago.  I have heard they are all modern changes.  You notice when Kim D. is talking to the horse salesman she pronounces each word individually, and so does he.  I've heard that during the days of the pioneers this country was at its' most educated level--I've also heard the opposite--that the pioneer mothers would teach their kids reading, writing, and math on the long road out west.  What do I say...beats me, I wasn't there, so you'll have to decide.7.  Heroics at its finest.8.  Kim Darby.  I don't believe it possible for her to have done a better job of acting.  I do not know if this was her first movie or acting job but one thing is certain--she was an expert.  Watch her face and body language especially when she slid down the mountain side and met up with Cheney (I hope I spelled that right) the low life who murdered her papa.Watch her mouth as she is torn between crying and sneering at the murderer confronting her--it sounded authentic to me.  Great job!9.  The horse salesman, I couldn't have done it better myself even after seeing the movie.10 Glenn Campbell.  Regardless of what the reviewers and advertisment said, he did a great job.  Take the few last scenes of the movie.  Campbell has that well combed hair.  He's a Texas Ranger but probably one who stayed closer to the city--a lady's man.  Then take John Wayne, pot bellied, patch over one eye, burned out somewhat drunk.  Glenn and Kim are running back down the trail after John shoots it out with 'Lucky' Ned Pepper.  That guy jumps right out from the brush and whacks him with a rock.  This is what happens to a city guy who only occasionally goes out into the country.  Then John Wayne shows up, pistol in hand, spots the bad guy with the gun and 'Bam!' no more bad guy.  This is somebody who lived in the country everyday--their a little harder to sneak up on.  It is my opinion Glenn Campbell played his part perfectly--a Texas Ranger who is also a lady's man.11.  The two times John cussed I feel were called for.  That is extremely rare especially today.12.  The two actors in the survival shack?  Over acting?  No.  People who act like that in real life usually walk both sides of the law and light and darkness and can appear as either.  Hooper did great--I've met people like that--a true believer who turned bad once.13.  Lawyer Dagget?  I guess I spelled that correctly.  Just fine, all proper, dressed the part showing his success in non assuming cloths showing he was proper and reserved.14.  The funny moments are funny to anyone who is not jaded permanently.15.  Despite the occasional flaw in the lines it is okay.  It just adds flavor to it.16.  ""You think one on four's a dog fall?""?  I think it means ""You think one against four is easy?""""Hurray for the man from Texas, some bullie shot!""  Use to, when people stood up and cheered somebody, they would yell 'Well bullie for you!""""I never busted a cap on a woman or nobody much under sixteen, but it is enough for you to know I'll do what I have to do.""  Means either, bash her head in or-- long ago they used brass caps in their pistols.  You would load the revolver from the front of the cylinder and after you were finished you would put a small brass little 'cap' on the other side of the cylinder.  Kind of like a blasting cap or a 'cap' for a blank gun.--it could have meant shoot her.All in all, the movies' language such as its' funny moments are a sign of the times...back then it made sense to us.  It still does to me.  Sorry it does not to you.CONS:There is no downside to this movie.  The acting is there, the storyline is there, the fun is there, the scenery is there.  A little girl is in trouble, two world class heros ride to the rescue, who could stop them.So all in all, I can't say you don't know what you are talking about if you didn't like this movie, but I will say your judement in matters of what constitutes real art are in question.

John Wayne won his one and only Oscar for his performance as Rooster Cogburn and what a deserved award it was.  Wayne had the foresight to see that this was a role tailer made for him.  He lost out on the bidding but that turned out to be a blessing because Hal Wallis got the rights to the book.  Hal also had Wayne in mind as the lead role.  It's mere speculation both I'm confident that the Wallis/Hathaway production was better that what might have been.  After all, how could this movie be any better?  All of the acting is terrific even if it comes from someone so unlikely as Glen Campbell.  Kim Darby turns out to be something of a one-shot wonder but this role was designed for her.  Playing the adult-like child who tries to take on the world in search of justice, she emotes just the right assortment of confidence and vulnerability.  The character actors, especially Strother Martin embellish the story every step of the way.  The scenery captured so wonderfully by the expert camera work was absolutely inspiring at times.  There was excitement, suspense, heroics, and more.  There was a relationship that developed between Matty Ross (Kim Darby) and Rooster Cogburn that was touching in a different sort of way.  Throughout the whole movie, served in generous helpings, was a most enjoyable sort of humor.  Wayne was actually doing a satire of sorts on many of his previous characters.  He projected an off-beat sort of image of what the Ringo Kid might have looked like at 60.The humor underscores an atmosphere that is somewhat surreal throughout the movie.  It's as though someone wanted to portray a Western in which the characters all spoke and acted like they from a slightly different world.  In this case that different world is the 1880's as opposed to modern-day Hollywood's image of the American West.  There are times you think, ""Did he REALLY say that?"" but it works well and it gives the humor an added touch.  Some may not see through it (or else, not care to see through it) and the movie may then appear as a combination of bad writing and over-acting.  That would be too bad because there are a number of classic scenes throughout the film.

A solid Western and a classic within the genre.True Grit is probably John Wayne's best performance, although it wouldn't be his last, even though he did win an Oscar for it. He also felt the story strong enough to entertain the idea of doing a sequel of the character, Marshall Rooster Cogburn, which is now elementary. Listening to the commentary though, it was stated that a third film was in the works and both Wayne and Hepburn were both happy to reprise their roles whenever filming began,Rooster Cogburn (...and the Lady)being the second and final.Kim Darby as 'Baby Sister' was also very memorable. When I saw her later inBetter Off Deadyears later, I not only didn't recognize her, but I was convinced that I recognized her voice from somewhere, which is probably one of those truly signature film voices of all time. It's just a shame she wasn't tapped for better roles through the years to show it off.True Grit is a incredibly well-written story, nice cinematography and hardy villains (Robert Duvall & Dennis Hopper) which makes for a well-spent two hours and eight minutes.

Maddie Ross (Kim Darby) is a young woman determined to hunt down and bring to justice the man responsible for killing her father.  When the local sheriff of the town where he was murdered tells her there is very little she can do, she sets out to find a U.S. Marshal can help her.  Her search leads her to Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn (John Wayne), a no holds bar enforcer who is old, overweight, and prone to drink.  However, Cogburn has the special quality of grit that Maddie is looking for and she hires him to hunt down Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), her father's murderer.  However, Maddie isn't the only person seeking Chaney.  He's also wanted in Texas for murdering a Senator and a young Texas Ranger named La Boeuf (Glen Campbell) is hot on his trail.  Against Maddie's wishes Cogburn agrees to have La Boeuf join him on and the hunt is on.  Their journey takes them through some very dangerous territory and brings them into contact with some very bad people and lethal animals.John Wayne delivers one of the best performances of his career.  Wayne deserved the Oscar, but his performance is improved by the somewhat underwhelming performances of Kim Darby and Glen Campbell.  Darby and Campbell are talented performers, but both are miscast for the characters they portray.  On the other hand, Wayne is in top form and Rooster Cogburn is a character he was destined to play.  I also enjoyed seeing Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper as two of the bad guys.The music in the movie gets a lot of recognition.  The score is beautiful and was composed by Elmer Bernstein and Campbell sings the title song. However, though the music is lovely, like two of the three actors, it's really out of place for the type of movie that TRUE GRIT is.  The score creates images of flowers, sunsets, and butterflies in one's mind.  That's all find and dandy, but TRUE GRIT is filled with danger, death, and darkness and the music should reflect that. For instance, there could have been the sound of some jarring strings (violins and not guitars) instead soft and soothing piano-based melodies.Still, although TRUE GRIT isn't as dark and gritty as the novel on which it is based, it's a charming little Western that offers a glimpse of John Wayne at his finest.

There is real chemistry between he and Kim Darby, and that chemistry really propels the movie along towards the great climax at the finish. Kim Darby does a fine job as Mattie Rose. She's a no frills by the numbers young women and her run-ins with the men in ""True Grit"" make for some very fun viewing.Glen Campbell is adequate as the Texas Ranger who is involved in tracking the same killer, but he's a bit wooden and a different actor might have brought more to the role. There is also a wonderful supporting cast. Look for Strother Martin, hilarious as a suffering horse dealer who must deal with Mattie and also Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper.""True Grit"" delivers some decent fun and entertainment.

Back in 1970, when John Wayne got the Academy Award over Dustin Hoffman, I thought an injustice had been done.  I was wrong.  The Oscar is awarded for accomplishment.  Sometimes it's purely for acting  but sometimes other elements are taken into consideration.  The Academy made the right call.  The history of American film would be different story if it weren't for John Wayne.  You only have to watch this film to see why he is one of the greatest screen stars of all time.
