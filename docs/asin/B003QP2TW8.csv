1359066,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B003QP2TW8,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Out of all Jane Austen's novels, ""Persuasion"" is probably the hardest one to adapt -- especially since Anne Elliott is a quiet, understated heroine.So it's not much of a surprise that the 2007 adaptation of ""Persuasion"" is... well, a bellyflop. The story is strangely pallid and colorless, without any moments of actual passion or intensity -- and despite being simplified and streamlined for Austen noobs, it feels very rushed. And it's hard to tell if the limp, weepy depiction of Anne is due to the direction or actress Sally Hawkins.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott (Hawkins) was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth (Rupert Penry-Jones), but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell (Alice Krige). Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter (Anthony Stewart Head)  is facing financial ruin.So Lady Russell convinces Sir Walter to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her concerns clash with her shallow father and sister. Furthermore, her father's entailed heir William (Tobias Menzies) recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.""Persuasion"" feels like it was directed by a depressed person -- everything is filmed in a wobbly, pallid way that makes me think of a Regency-era found footage movie. There's no sense of passion here, except for the all-too-frequent scenes where Anne goes to her room to blubber over Frederick seemingly being in love with someone else. When people are injured, or angry, or happy... there's just a sense of grey flatness, underscored by slow violins.Admittedly it's not a bad way to be introduced to the plot of ""Persuasion,"" especially since the scenery is breathtakingly pretty in the pale light -- the beaches, the forests, the rambling stone houses. The story is rather simplified here... but it still feels rushed. For instance, Mrs. Smith randomly pops up on the street to breathlessly blurt out exposition to Anne, even though Anne supposedly visited her earlier in the movie. It feels overstuffed and stripped-down at the same time.And the climax is unintentionally absurd. First Anne goes on a wild ""Run Lola Run"" sprint through Bath twice (which, in Regency dress, looks completely silly). Then she has the world's least sexy kissing scene with Wentworth, where she keeps opening and closing her mouth pre-kiss -- it's like watching a hungry fish trying to reach a hook.I'll give Hawkins and Penry-Jones credit -- they do pretty well with their characters, although Penry-Jones looks a bit pale to be a professional sailor. Unfortunately, Anne is... kind of spineless and gormless here. She cries a lot, and never shows even a flicker of spirit where Wentworth is concerned -- it's hard to see why a strong sea-captain would be attracted to her. And the movie wastes Krige and Stewart-Head, neither of whom get to do much -- she flutters around anxiously, and he fusses. That's it.But I'm... simply mesmerized by Amanda Hale's performance. It is possibly the most bizarre performance I have ever seen in a movie -- her Mary honestly comes across as mentally disabled sometimes. It just left me wondering... whose idea was that?""Persuasion"" is a decent introduction to Jane Austen's story if you've never read the book or seen any other adaptation... but for those familiar with Austen's works, this rushed, joyless version will fail to persuade.",2,Persuaded not to persuade,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,3872,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'Persuasion', 'probably', 'hardest', 'one', 'adapt', 'especially', 'Anne', 'Elliott', 'quiet', 'understated', 'heroine.So', 'not', 'much', 'surprise', '2007', 'adaptation', 'Persuasion', 'well', 'bellyflop', 'story', 'strangely', 'pallid', 'colorless', 'moments', 'actual', 'passion', 'intensity', 'being', 'simplified', 'streamlined', 'Austen', 'noobs', 'very', 'rushed', 'hard', 'tell', 'limp', 'weepy', 'depiction', 'Anne', 'due', 'direction', 'actress', 'Sally', 'Hawkins.Eight', 'years', 'ago', 'Anne', 'Elliott', 'Hawkins', 'was', 'engaged', 'handsome', 'intelligent', 'impoverished', 'sailor', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'was', 'persuaded', 'dump', 'family', 'friend', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Now', 'twenty-seven', 'ancient', 'time', 'standards', 'vain', 'father', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'facing', 'financial', 'ruin.So', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'convinces', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'relocate', 'Bath', 'rent', 'vast', 'family', 'estate', 'out', 'new', 'tenant', 'Frederick', 'brother-in-law', 'course', 'Anne', 'still', 'Frederick', ""n't"", 'seem', 'feel', 'same', 'especially', 'rumored', 'be', 'interested', 'younger', 'flirtier', 'girls.And', 'Anne', 'worries', 'increase', 'when', 'family', 'Bath', 'where', 'concerns', 'clash', 'shallow', 'father', 'sister', 'Furthermore', 'father', 'entailed', 'heir', 'William', 'Tobias', 'Menzies', 'recently', 'reestablished', 'contact', 'relatives', 'very', 'interested', 'Anne', 'Anne', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'even', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'Frederick', 'truly', 'Persuasion', 'feels', 'was', 'directed', 'depressed', 'person', 'everything', 'filmed', 'wobbly', 'pallid', 'way', 'think', 'Regency-era', 'found', 'footage', 'movie', 'sense', 'passion', 'here', 'all-too-frequent', 'scenes', 'where', 'Anne', 'room', 'blubber', 'Frederick', 'seemingly', 'being', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'When', 'people', 'are', 'injured', 'angry', 'happy', 'just', 'sense', 'grey', 'flatness', 'underscored', 'slow', 'violins.Admittedly', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'be', 'introduced', 'plot', 'Persuasion', 'especially', 'scenery', 'breathtakingly', 'pretty', 'pale', 'light', 'beaches', 'forests', 'rambling', 'stone', 'houses', 'story', 'rather', 'simplified', 'here', 'still', 'rushed', 'instance', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'randomly', 'up', 'street', 'breathlessly', 'blurt', 'out', 'exposition', 'Anne', 'even', 'Anne', 'supposedly', 'visited', 'earlier', 'movie', 'overstuffed', 'stripped-down', 'same', 'time.And', 'climax', 'unintentionally', 'absurd', 'First', 'Anne', 'wild', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'sprint', 'Bath', 'twice', 'Regency', 'dress', 'completely', 'silly', 'Then', 'world', 'least', 'sexy', 'kissing', 'scene', 'Wentworth', 'where', 'opening', 'closing', 'mouth', 'pre-kiss', 'watching', 'hungry', 'fish', 'trying', 'reach', 'hook.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Hawkins', 'Penry-Jones', 'credit', 'do', 'pretty', 'well', 'characters', 'Penry-Jones', 'bit', 'pale', 'be', 'professional', 'sailor', 'Unfortunately', 'Anne', 'kind', 'spineless', 'gormless', 'here', 'lot', 'never', 'even', 'flicker', 'spirit', 'where', 'Wentworth', 'concerned', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'strong', 'sea-captain', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'movie', 'Krige', 'Stewart-Head', 'neither', 'whom', 'get', 'do', 'much', 'around', 'anxiously', 'it.But', ""'m"", 'simply', 'mesmerized', 'Amanda', 'Hale', 'performance', 'possibly', 'most', 'bizarre', 'performance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'Mary', 'honestly', 'across', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'sometimes', 'just', 'left', 'wondering', 'idea', 'was', 'Persuasion', 'decent', 'introduction', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'story', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'other', 'adaptation', 'familiar', 'Austen', 'works', 'rushed', 'joyless', 'version', 'will', 'fail', 'persuade']",N/A

Butler ""Film Addict""","[0, 0]","Right up front I'll admit that I enjoyed the 1995 BBC/Sony Pictures version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds over this 2007 re-boot.  It was eleven minutes longer, I and definitely liked the '95 version's ending over the 2007 version.  I think Ms. Austen may be doing some flips/rolls in her grave if she was aware of the &#34;liberties&#34; the scriptwriter took with the source material: how her heroine was made to run all over Bath trying to catch up with Capt. Wentworth, how the minor character Mrs. Smith was not portrayed as an invalid as she is in the book - and how she and her Nurse Rook, provided Anne with much needed information as in other versions; Anne and Frederick waltzing on the lawn outside Kellynch Hall ... come on!  But the locations, sets and costumes don't cause any complaints from me.  Yes, I agree with another reviewer who thought the actress cast as Elizabeth was a bit old, and sister Mary's portrayer conveyed just the right amount of whiney, unlovable and unpleasant characteristics that came through on the page.But the real reason, besides the ones I mentioned above, that I made this purchase was to see Rupert Penry-Jones - he justifies the expense!",4,Trying To Obtain Each Of The Austen Page-To-The-Screen Projects ...,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,1193,"['Right', 'up', 'front', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'enjoyed', '1995', 'BBC/Sony', 'Pictures', 'version', 'starring', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', '2007', 're-boot', 'was', 'eleven', 'minutes', 'longer', 'definitely', 'liked', ""'95"", 'version', 'ending', '2007', 'version', 'think', 'Ms.', 'Austen', 'may', 'be', 'doing', 'flips/rolls', 'grave', 'was', 'aware', '34', 'liberties', '34', 'scriptwriter', 'took', 'source', 'material', 'how', 'heroine', 'was', 'made', 'run', 'Bath', 'trying', 'catch', 'up', 'Capt', 'Wentworth', 'how', 'minor', 'character', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'was', 'not', 'portrayed', 'invalid', 'book', 'how', 'Nurse', 'Rook', 'provided', 'Anne', 'much', 'needed', 'information', 'other', 'versions', 'Anne', 'Frederick', 'waltzing', 'lawn', 'Kellynch', 'Hall', 'come', 'locations', 'sets', 'costumes', 'do', ""n't"", 'cause', 'complaints', 'Yes', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'thought', 'actress', 'cast', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'bit', 'old', 'sister', 'Mary', 'portrayer', 'conveyed', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'whiney', 'unlovable', 'unpleasant', 'characteristics', 'came', 'page.But', 'real', 'reason', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'above', 'made', 'purchase', 'was', 'see', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'expense']",N/A

1359083,AURACYZMBVHGK,B003QP2TW8,SianaS,"[2, 2]","The best thing about this version is Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth. While a tad too good looking and smooth faced for a naval captain that fought in a ruthless war, for the most part he does a credible job of portraying Wentworth.The worst thing about this movie is that either the screenwriter or the director have taken undue liberties with the plot. I found RPJ and SH's acting to be good, but unfortunately they had the deck stacked against them by the terrible script and/or the terrible directing.The most egregious offense as far as I'm concerned is changing Anne from dignified, resigned and intelligent to mousy, inarticulate and ever-weeping. This new version of the heroine really makes you wonder why Captain Wentworth was ever interested in her and how can he continue to be so? All the intelligent conversations that Anne holds with Benwick and other characters in the book (and the 1995 adaptation) are cut out, giving the viewer absolutely no clue as to her personality and charms. Benwick, which is a fairly important character in the book, is given a grand total of 3 minutes screen time.Anne's expected bloom in the second half of the movie is simply never seen. She continues on mousy and washed out, with her mouth perpetually agape and trembling, weeping from beginning to end. I have to blame this one on the director. It is not bad acting but it is not in keeping with the Anne Elliot conceived by Austen. Meanwhile, even changing her hairstyle or giving her slighly prettier outfits would have helped create the impression that her reacquaintance with Wentworth is filling her with renewed hope and optimism, and that she is transformed by her love for him.The ending reeks of Harlequin, not only due to Anne's utterly inappropriate rendition of ""Run Lola, Run"" in 19th century Bath, but also because key parts of the plot have disappeared. When does Wentworth find the time to write her that letter since she chases after him right after elucidating the question of Mr. Elliot? When did he even have time to go back to Harville's and drop it off? And why didn't he just give it to her himself, since thay had just chatted?And the constancy conversation, the one that prompts his declaration....it was butchered. Cut down to a couple of sentences between Benwick (during the only scene he is even seen) and Anne, as opposed to Harville and Anne, and completely outside of Wentworth's earshot.Other oddities: Mrs. Croft and Elizabeth look way older than 38 and 29 respectively, Mary seems borderline manic, Charles Musgrove sounds foolish, Mrs. Smith is not disabled, Henrietta is barely shown and Captain Wentworth is surprised to realize he was courting Louisa. I have to dwell on this for a moment because, my reading of the book indicates that to a certain degree he did it to get back at Anne for her rejection, hence the ""unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant"" part of his letter.If you can forget about the novel, you can classify it as a well acted romantic costume drama with great visuals and a somewhat wimpy heroine. But it is not Jane Austen's Persuasion.

Why can't Jane Austen be just as theatrical and cinematic as a great work of film art? While they are undeniably classic books, why not release something that uses visuals and music to tell a different kind of story, one with deep emotional undercurrents to go along with the lovely dialog? As a answer to those questions we got quite a few fantastic adaptations, from Emma to Northanger Abbey, but this one is my favorite.An Understated but Powerful RomanceThe main character of this film reminds me very much of a friend of mine. Shy, quiet, selfless, genuine, and caring, her wants and needs, to say nothing of her feelings and desires, are buried deep down. She made a mistake years ago, and is tortured by the thought that she may have thrown away her only chance at real and complete happiness. For the romantic who knows feelings of pining and longing, this story is the food of the gods.The two leads are pretty much perfect in their roles, being compelling, understated, and deeply likable. You accept them both as the sort of people you would want for friends. Not for the person they are on the outside, but for the qualities they quietly wear and display with no bragging or fanfare (but which very much come to the attention of others).A sumptuous feast for the sensesI'm not normally one for the overcast dark palette of England, but here it is perfection. Not brooding or gothic, it comes across with a wonderful warmth of color that pulls you in. Not a sunny picture, to be sure, but beautifully, cinematically shot, with a haunting piano score that makes the heart ache with anticipation at the promise of loss restored. This isn't a story that is particularly long or that features particularly eye-popping scenery, but the film definitely makes the most of locations, editing, and scoring to take you on a lovely trip.I can't hear your criticism over the sound of my heart burstingSome people take issue with various aspects of this film. Particularly with the ending. Too modern? Too emotional? If Kenneth Branagh can take artistic liberties with Shakespeare to produce a great film, then I have ZERO issues with our shy, mousy heroine running as fast as her feet will carry her and getting lost in a rapturous moment of fulfilled longing when she finally agrees to marry and kisses her true love. It's called wish fulfillment people, and it's what makes life worth living. Inappropriate for the era? Sure. Wildly emotional? No doubt. And satisfying? Endlessly. Perfect. One of my favorite moments in any romantic film ever. Awesome.
