He achieves a nice balance b/w cynical observation of the aristocrat & melodramatic, even maudlin, sympathy. Lead actor Biswas' 1st name is pronounced ""chubby"", & indeed here he looks & acts like an overfed baby. Crisp, elegant cinematography, w/ lovely tracking shots, of the desolate palace w/ furniture all sold @ auction. The symbolism is rilly heavy-handed, but it's shot so well that one doesn't mind. Then there's the music: the zamindar blows the last of his fortune hiring the very best musicians, so we're treated to *3* scenes of complete songs by India's best musicians & dancers. Biswas IRL was basically tone-deaf w/ zero ear for music, so his convincing appreciation of it is a testament to his acting & Ray's direction. 8/10",4,THE MUSIC ROOM,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,829,"['only', 'Ray', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'THE', 'APU', 'TRILOGY', 'DISTANT', 'THUNDER', 'was', 'treat', 'nice', 'balance', 'b/w', 'cynical', 'observation', 'aristocrat', 'melodramatic', 'even', 'maudlin', 'sympathy', 'Lead', 'actor', 'Biswas', '1st', 'name', 'pronounced', 'chubby', 'indeed', 'here', 'overfed', 'baby', 'Crisp', 'elegant', 'cinematography', 'w/', 'lovely', 'tracking', 'shots', 'desolate', 'palace', 'w/', 'furniture', 'sold', '@', 'auction', 'symbolism', 'rilly', 'heavy-handed', 'shot', 'so', 'well', 'one', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Then', 'music', 'zamindar', 'last', 'fortune', 'hiring', 'very', 'best', 'musicians', ""'re"", 'treated', '*3*', 'scenes', 'complete', 'songs', 'India', 'best', 'musicians', 'dancers', 'Biswas', 'IRL', 'was', 'basically', 'tone-deaf', 'w/', 'zero', 'ear', 'music', 'convincing', 'appreciation', 'testament', 'acting', 'Ray', 'direction', '8/10']",The Music Room

I had never heard of Ray or this film.  This is a haunting, fascinating film that I will never forget, it is hypnotic from beginning to end.  I read more about Ray and I was so glad to find out he did receive the attention he deserved as a filmmaker during his life.

This is his fourth feature film and one of his best known outside the serial films such as the Apu Trilogy.The film depicts the dying era of aristocracy in India and a wealthy man who holds lavish music concerts in his estate.The Criterion release includes a blu-ray edition which is definitely worth getting instead of the DVD version.I hope Criterion will release more films from India one day",5,Criterion's first Indian film,1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,541,"['Music', 'Room', 'known', 'original', 'title', 'Jalsaghar', 'directed', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'who', 'considered', 'greatest', 'Bengali', 'filmmaker', 'time', 'fourth', 'feature', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'known', 'serial', 'films', 'such', 'Apu', 'Trilogy.The', 'film', 'dying', 'era', 'aristocracy', 'India', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'lavish', 'music', 'concerts', 'estate.The', 'Criterion', 'release', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'definitely', 'worth', 'getting', 'instead', 'DVD', 'version.I', 'hope', 'Criterion', 'will', 'release', 'more', 'films', 'India', 'one', 'day']",The Music Room
