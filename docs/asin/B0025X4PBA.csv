1250733,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0025X4PBA,calvinnme,"[44, 46]","This was one of a group of CBS rural comedies popular in the 1960's that were actually grouped together as far as having interdependent casts - ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Green Acres"" being the other two series.The show is about life at the rural Shady Rest Hotel, owned and operated by widow Kate Bradley (Bea Benaderet). Action centers around guests at the hotel as well as Kate's three attractive daughters, Betty Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Billie Jo. The actresses portraying Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo changed over the years. In fact, season two is the last of two seasons for the first actresses to portray these roles. Betty Jo, the youngest and the tomboy, was played by the Linda Henning, daughter of the series creator Paul Henning, for the entire run of the series. The hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere, halfway between two very small towns. The actual location (state for example) is never given, and the issue of how exactly it is that Kate manages to make what seems to be quite an adequate living running a hotel that theoretically should have few if any guests is never even addressed. This is a show very much rooted in the early 60's, and the idea is escapism and fun, not realism.The first season of this show that was put out a few months ago is excellent. They were not the cut down versions that TVLand showed, so I expect these to be the same, although you never know with Paramount, The Odd Couple being exhibit A.This season is from the 1964-1965 TV season, and thus there are lots of episodes (36 I believe), since production costs were lower and thus reruns were fewer. This is not something you'll want to sit down and watch back-to-back marathon style. Instead, I'd watch a couple of episodes a week. That way you maximize the fun of the show, and it still holds up pretty well today, and minimize the sameness you might feel if you just watch one episode after another.",4,Classic CBS rural comedy from the 60's,1239667200,"04 14, 2009",2009,1903,"['was', 'one', 'group', 'CBS', 'rural', 'comedies', 'popular', '1960', 'were', 'actually', 'grouped', 'together', 'as', 'far', 'having', 'interdependent', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'Green', 'Acres', 'being', 'other', 'two', 'series.The', 'show', 'life', 'rural', 'Shady', 'Rest', 'Hotel', 'owned', 'operated', 'widow', 'Kate', 'Bradley', 'Bea', 'Benaderet', 'Action', 'centers', 'guests', 'hotel', 'as', 'well', 'Kate', 'three', 'attractive', 'daughters', 'Betty', 'Jo', 'Bobbie', 'Jo', 'Billie', 'Jo', 'actresses', 'portraying', 'Billie', 'Jo', 'Bobbie', 'Jo', 'changed', 'years', 'fact', 'season', 'two', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'first', 'portray', 'roles', 'Betty', 'Jo', 'youngest', 'tomboy', 'was', 'played', 'Linda', 'Henning', 'daughter', 'series', 'creator', 'Paul', 'Henning', 'entire', 'run', 'series', 'hotel', 'literally', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'halfway', 'two', 'very', 'small', 'towns', 'actual', 'location', 'state', 'example', 'never', 'given', 'issue', 'how', 'exactly', 'Kate', 'make', 'what', 'be', 'quite', 'adequate', 'living', 'running', 'hotel', 'theoretically', 'should', 'have', 'few', 'guests', 'never', 'even', 'addressed', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'rooted', 'early', '60', 'idea', 'escapism', 'fun', 'not', 'realism.The', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'excellent', 'were', 'not', 'cut', 'down', 'versions', 'TVLand', 'showed', 'expect', 'be', 'same', 'never', 'know', 'Paramount', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'being', 'exhibit', 'A.This', 'season', '1964-1965', 'TV', 'season', 'thus', 'are', 'lots', 'episodes', '36', 'believe', 'production', 'costs', 'were', 'lower', 'thus', 'reruns', 'were', 'fewer', 'not', 'something', ""'ll"", 'want', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'back-to-back', 'marathon', 'style', 'Instead', ""'d"", 'watch', 'couple', 'episodes', 'week', 'way', 'maximize', 'fun', 'show', 'still', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'today', 'minimize', 'sameness', 'might', 'feel', 'just', 'watch', 'one', 'episode']",Petticoat Junction: The Official Second Season

It has all thirty six episodes of this second season of this funny and terrific show that ran on the CBS network from 1963-1970. The only special features that if offers are interviews with Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell and another photo gallery. We are again treated with video intros by both Linda Kaye Henning and Pat Woodell.Likewise with the Official First Season, we are treated with the entire second season. The episodes are digitally remastered from original negatives for superb and superior quality. The original theme song is also included with the episodes of the series.The entire cast from Season One are all here and there was a new cast addition for Season Two, they now have a dog named Higgins. The second season continues much like the first season as Kate Bradley, her beautiful daughters and their Uncle Joe Carson deal with life living at and running the Shady Rest Hotel.Likewise, Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD do another wonderful job on these episodes. The digital remastering makes the episodes fresh, clean and new as the day that they were originally shown on the CBS TV network.Likewise, this is yet another best set of this classic TV show that makes mincemeat out of all those public domain DVD sets that were released as the DVD boom was taking off.If anyone from Paramount and it's sister company CBS DVD are reading this, why not release the entire Petticoat Junction series on DVD? That way, we fans and admirers of this series can really be overjoyed. This is only a suggestion, but again, I still think that the entire series should be released officially on DVD.

Since Linda Kaye Henning is the daughter of the creator, Paul Henning she has seen that the show is presented as it originally aired. Seeing both Ms.Henning and Pat Wodell, the original Bobbie Jo was a lot of fun. Most people do not realize there were three Billie Jo's and two Bobbie Jo's. I do not remember why Pat Wodell left but most people remember Lori Saunders as Bobbie Jo. Also Meredith McRae is probably the best remembered Billie Jo since this was the ones shown in syndication and on TV Land. Most of the cast is gone now but their talent lives on. Once the show went to color, Charles Lane was not seen much as Homer Bedloe. Later the show revolved around mainly the love story of Betty Jo and Steve Eliott, Ms Henning's former husband as well as their baby Kathy Jo. Also Henning, McRae and Saunders tried to make an outside act called the Petticoat Junction Girls and went on various talk show like Merv Griffin. Another trivia fact only us older folks remember is there was a third Billie Jo played by Gunilla Hutton. I think she might have been between Jeanne Riley and Meredith McRae. Hutton later was on Hee Haw. I wonder what will be in the future extras since so many of the original cast members are no longer around. I would like to see some of the promos and old interviews.

When I was a kid I watched PJ in syndication and they only ran the color seasons, so it's great to be able to finally see these earlier shows.

It is a high quality production with excellent video quality, good organization and extra features.  The same can be said for the first season, also by CBS home video.  Petticoat Junction has been shown in reruns but rarely, if ever, have I seen the first two seasons, which are in black and white.  Bobbie Jo was played by Pat Woodell, who was replaced by Lori Saunders beginning with season three, and Billie Jo's character changed twice after Jeannine Riley began the role.  It is a pleasure to watch these rarely seen episodes.  Also, the old Hooterville Cannonball is more of a prominent fixture in these first two seasons, which was later largely replaced with a model.",5,FInally released on DVD,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,731,"['CBS', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'putting', 'DVD', 'together', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'excellent', 'video', 'quality', 'good', 'organization', 'extra', 'features', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'CBS', 'home', 'video', 'Petticoat', 'Junction', 'been', 'shown', 'reruns', 'rarely', 'ever', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'Bobbie', 'Jo', 'was', 'played', 'Pat', 'Woodell', 'who', 'was', 'replaced', 'Lori', 'Saunders', 'beginning', 'season', 'three', 'Billie', 'Jo', 'character', 'changed', 'twice', 'Jeannine', 'Riley', 'began', 'role', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'rarely', 'seen', 'episodes', 'Also', 'old', 'Hooterville', 'Cannonball', 'more', 'prominent', 'fixture', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'later', 'largely', 'replaced', 'model']",Petticoat Junction: The Official Second Season
