Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 4]","Even old as he is at this stage in 1966 (he was around 62), it's still weird to see Cary Grant onscreen playing matchmaker instead of playing the field. Still, he accomplishes even his matchmaking role with his usual style and grace, and you get the feeling that he could've stolen Samantha Eggar from under Jim Hutton's nose if he put his mind to it. After all, the man is Cary friggin' Grant. Guy invented debonair.Mr. Grant plays Sir William Rutland, a happily married gent and industrialist on a business trip to Tokyo, except that he's arrived two days earlier than scheduled and his room reservation doesn't kick in yet. Sir William picked a pretty awful date to show up, his visit coinciding with the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and there is a horrible housing shortage. Luckily, he gets wind at the embassy of a woman willing to take on a roommate, and it's a never mind that Sir William learns that the woman had intended to let only to fellow women. Sir William being played by Cary Grant, he eventually wears down Christine Easton, his new British ""landlord.""WALK DON'T RUN made me sad a bit because I knew going in that it was Cary Grant's swan song, the man leaving cinema behind still near the height of his powers. And while WALK DON'T RUN doesn't succeed in all its stabs at levity, it did make me smile in places. Some of the comedy derives from the lovely Christine Easton (Samantha Eggar) being such a precise and super-organized woman. It's a real joy to see that Grant still has masterful control of what he does best, which are those bemused sidelong glances and double takes. He showers these on Christine as she meticulously breaks down the bathroom time table for him. In fact, she literally breaks the morning schedule down to its exact minutes, and a confounded Sir William soon wails: ""What time do I shower? 7:35 or 7:37?"" We're not too surprised when it's revealed that Christine Easton is engaged to an officious embassy official aptly named Julius P. Haversack. And, later on, there's also some fun with mysteriously vanishing trousers.While out and about Sir William meets and takes a liking to young architect-slash-Olympic athlete Steve Davis (Hutton) who also had flown in two days ahead of schedule and is looking for lodgings. Sir William offers half of his room and board, and maybe he should've consulted with his landlord first, because she ends up livid (but remember this is Cary Grant so she inevitably capitulates). Steve, of course, would have to be inducted into the pinpoint time table regarding bathroom use. There's a vague air of mystery, by the way, in Steve's recurring evasiveness concerning the nature of his Olympics event. He hems and haws for most of the movie, and no wonder. Sir William would later proclaim of Steve's event: ""This is THE most ridiculous race.""Cary Grant plays the busybody Cupid but, here's the thing, the movie audience is ever aware that it's Cary Grant in the room, even old as he is. And so, Jim Hutton, cast in the romantic role and who is to ""bland"" what Grant is to ""charming,"" stands no chance; he withers under the comparison. Hutton's romance with Samantha Eggar feels rather shallow and convenient. And Hutton and Eggar together can't come up with any bits of humor. Instead laughs come by either thru a combination of Grant and Eggar or Grant and Hutton or Grant with both Eggar and Hutton. There's also a tired bit about a fumbly Russian minder minding a Russian Olympian. It's not very funny.For Star Trek freaks, George Takei (the original Lt. Sulu) has a cameo late in the movie as a police captain who determines whether our central characters are, in fact, spies.WALK DON'T RUN is a remake of George Steven's sublime THE MORE THE MERRIER - and if you haven't seen that one, you are seriously missing out on a classic wartime romantic comedy. WALK DON'T RUN, sadly, doesn't live up to the original picture. Equal parts of blame must go to the rather flat screenplay and Jim Hutton who is to ""bland"" what Gran- oh, never mind. Just know that Cary Grant effortlessly carries the movie, convincing me to rate WALK DON'T RUN 3.5 out of 5 stars.",4,"""I don't know that I like tricky people.""",1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,4128,"['Even', 'old', 'stage', '1966', 'was', 'around', '62', 'still', 'weird', 'see', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'onscreen', 'playing', 'matchmaker', 'instead', 'playing', 'field', 'Still', 'even', 'matchmaking', 'role', 'usual', 'style', 'grace', 'get', 'feeling', 'could', ""'ve"", 'stolen', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'nose', 'put', 'mind', 'man', 'Cary', 'friggin', 'Grant', 'Guy', 'invented', 'debonair.Mr', 'Grant', 'Sir', 'William', 'Rutland', 'happily', 'married', 'gent', 'industrialist', 'business', 'trip', 'Tokyo', 'arrived', 'two', 'days', 'earlier', 'scheduled', 'room', 'reservation', ""n't"", 'kick', 'yet', 'Sir', 'William', 'picked', 'pretty', 'awful', 'date', 'show', 'up', 'visit', 'coinciding', '1964', 'Tokyo', 'Olympics', 'horrible', 'housing', 'shortage', 'Luckily', 'wind', 'embassy', 'woman', 'willing', 'take', 'roommate', 'never', 'mind', 'Sir', 'William', 'woman', 'had', 'intended', 'let', 'only', 'fellow', 'women', 'Sir', 'William', 'being', 'played', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'eventually', 'down', 'Christine', 'Easton', 'new', 'British', 'landlord', 'WALK', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'RUN', 'made', 'sad', 'bit', 'knew', 'going', 'was', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'swan', 'song', 'man', 'leaving', 'cinema', 'still', 'height', 'powers', 'WALK', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'RUN', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'stabs', 'levity', 'did', 'make', 'smile', 'places', 'comedy', 'lovely', 'Christine', 'Easton', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'being', 'such', 'precise', 'super-organized', 'woman', 'real', 'joy', 'see', 'Grant', 'still', 'masterful', 'control', 'what', 'best', 'are', 'bemused', 'sidelong', 'glances', 'double', 'Christine', 'meticulously', 'down', 'bathroom', 'time', 'table', 'fact', 'literally', 'morning', 'schedule', 'down', 'exact', 'minutes', 'confounded', 'Sir', 'William', 'soon', 'What', 'time', 'do', 'shower', '7:35', '7:37', ""'re"", 'not', 'too', 'surprised', 'when', 'revealed', 'Christine', 'Easton', 'engaged', 'officious', 'embassy', 'official', 'aptly', 'named', 'Julius', 'P.', 'Haversack', 'later', 'also', 'fun', 'mysteriously', 'vanishing', 'trousers.While', 'Sir', 'William', 'meets', 'liking', 'young', 'architect-slash-Olympic', 'athlete', 'Steve', 'Davis', 'Hutton', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'flown', 'two', 'days', 'ahead', 'schedule', 'looking', 'lodgings', 'Sir', 'William', 'half', 'room', 'board', 'maybe', 'should', ""'ve"", 'consulted', 'landlord', 'first', 'up', 'livid', 'remember', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'inevitably', 'Steve', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'inducted', 'pinpoint', 'time', 'table', 'regarding', 'bathroom', 'use', 'vague', 'air', 'mystery', 'way', 'Steve', 'recurring', 'evasiveness', 'concerning', 'nature', 'Olympics', 'event', 'haws', 'most', 'movie', 'wonder', 'Sir', 'William', 'would', 'later', 'proclaim', 'Steve', 'event', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'race', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'busybody', 'Cupid', 'here', 'thing', 'movie', 'audience', 'ever', 'aware', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'room', 'even', 'old', 'so', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'cast', 'romantic', 'role', 'who', 'bland', 'what', 'Grant', 'charming', 'chance', 'comparison', 'Hutton', 'romance', 'Samantha', 'Eggar', 'feels', 'rather', 'shallow', 'convenient', 'Hutton', 'Eggar', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'bits', 'humor', 'Instead', 'come', 'thru', 'combination', 'Grant', 'Eggar', 'Grant', 'Hutton', 'Grant', 'Eggar', 'Hutton', 'also', 'tired', 'bit', 'fumbly', 'Russian', 'minder', 'minding', 'Russian', 'Olympian', 'not', 'very', 'funny.For', 'Star', 'Trek', 'freaks', 'George', 'Takei', 'original', 'Lt.', 'Sulu', 'cameo', 'late', 'movie', 'police', 'captain', 'who', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'fact', 'spies.WALK', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'RUN', 'remake', 'George', 'Steven', 'sublime', 'THE', 'MORE', 'THE', 'MERRIER', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'are', 'seriously', 'missing', 'out', 'classic', 'wartime', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'WALK', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'RUN', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'original', 'picture', 'Equal', 'parts', 'blame', 'must', 'go', 'rather', 'flat', 'screenplay', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'who', 'bland', 'what', 'Gran-', 'oh', 'never', 'mind', 'Just', 'know', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'effortlessly', 'movie', 'convincing', 'rate', 'WALK', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'RUN', '3.5', '5', 'stars']","Walk, Don't Run"

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[47, 49]","In 1966, Cary Grant retired from his distinguished 34-year acting career after starring in the lighthearted romantic comedy ""Walk, Don't Run"".  Set in Tokyo, Japan during the 1964 Olympics, Sir William Rutland (Cary Grant, 1904-1986), a very wealthy British industrialist, arrived in Tokyo two days ahead of schedule and the lavish Okura Hotel (where he is supposed to stay) has no rooms available.  In fact, the Olympics have placed a giant ""no vacancy"" sign across the entire city of Tokyo.  Frustrated, William goes to the British Embassy to seek out assistance in locating a room.  There, he is seen by the snobbish & indifferent Julius P. Haversack (John Standing) whose attitude changes towards Sir William upon discovering who Sir William is.  Sir William wanders out of Mr. Haversack's office and finds a bulletin board with a advertisement to share an apartment.  Desperate to have a place to sleep, Sir William grabs the advertisement and travels to its address.  Upon arriving, the woman who rents the apartment, Christine Easton (Samantha Eggar), doesn't want to share her apartment with a man, but is unable to convince Sir William to leave and reluctantly allows him to stay.  The following day, while Sir William is conducting business with a Japanese company, he comes across an American busily taking pictures and making notes about the building's architecture.  The American, Steve Davis (Jim Hutton, 1934-1979), is part of the American Olympic team, but is reluctant to discuss which event he is in.  Also, insufficient room in the Olympics' housing has left Steve homeless, so he immediately latches upon Sir William to stay with him.  Of course, Miss Easton is not particularly happy to discover that Sir William has sublet his part of the apartment, but again very reluctantly lets Steve stay as well.  Of course, this creates even more havoc for everyone to try and use the apartment's single bathroom.  Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Miss Easton is engaged to the unpleasant Mr. Haversack at the British Embassy, but Sir William would like to see the single Steve woo Miss Easton instead.Other memorable characters in the film include Miss Easton's friend Aiko Kurawa (Miiko Taka), Steve's Russian friend & fellow Olympian Yuri Andreyovitch (Ted Hartley), the dimwitted KGB agent Dmitri (Ben Astar, 1909-1988), Aiko's parents (Teru Shimada, 1905-1988, and Lois Kiuchi) and the young boy & girl that often sit on the stairs inside the apartment building (Craig Matsunaga & Patty Siu).  Fans of ""Star Trek"" will no doubt recognize George Takei playing the police captain.  George Takei is known more for his repeated role as Lt.

That's what comedy movies are for.It was Cary Grant's last major film role; he was at the age for character parts, but this was no minor part.  He plays a personable, confident (to the point of being pushy), middle-aged British businessman who happens to be in Japan at the time of the 1964 Olympic Summer Games.  The shortage of living space compels him to rent the spare bedroom of a young British woman for a couple of days.  Then he sublets half the bedroom to a blunt young American architect/Olympic competitor, and proceeds to matchmake in a - well, an unsubtle way.As you watch this, you need to be aware of a few things that may otherwise seem like private jokes you're not in on.  At the time, it was unusual (and apt to raise eyebrows) for unmarried people of the opposite sex to share living quarters.  It was *not* unusual for USSR athletes to be shadowed and spied upon by their police during this cold-war period.  Japanese transistor technology had only recently come up with mini-recorders and other pocket-sized electronic gadgets.  And the sport in which Jim Hutton's character competes - I'm not going to say what it is - was quite new and considered rather, well, strange-looking by the public.  (Cary Grant makes it look even stranger.)This movie does have a little action, but it's mostly about the character interaction.  The leisurely but well-moving plot (a remake of a 1943 film, by the way) isn't very deep, but it holds together.  The script-writing and the dialogue are quite good.  The trouser scene is remarkable.  The repartee between Cary Grant and Jim Hutton sparkles.  Mr. Grant's character is smooth and near-perfect.  Mr. Hutton's character is brusque and charming.  Samantha Eggar beautifully characterizes the sensitive young woman who is trying hard to be practical.  John Standing is excellent as the officious, self-absorbed wannabe diplomat.  Miko Taka is fine in the minor role of the Japanese friend with the quick wit.  Even the two step-sitting children, who say nothing but see everything, are memorable.It's not a kiddie movie, but you can watch it with your children and grandchildren, and you'll all enjoy it.

This may be appropriate since he was 62 when this movie was made. The twist in the movie is that he sees a younger version of himself in a young American Olympian named Steve Davis (Jim Hutton) whom he meets during the 1964 Olympic Games.Cary Grant plays William Rutland a charming businessman; during one of his business trips to Tokyo, he persuades a young woman named Christine Easton (Samantha Eggar) to sublet her apartment, when he could not find a place to stay in the city. The two become unwilling roomies because of the gender difference. While the Christine is not too thrilled with the arrangement she tries to adjust with the new situation, but it gets a little more complicated when Rutland sublets his apartment to Steve Davis. Rutland plays cupid on two young roommates in spite of their incompatible personalities, and Christine's engagement to a boring diplomat named Julius Haversack (John Standing). Rutland meddles in the young couple's romantic problems, and goes an extra distance to pretend as a competitor of 20 kilometer walk to talk to Jim during his event, and tries to heal the differences between the young lovers. The best moments of the film are Rutland's walk in his boxer shorts and a T-shirt avoiding the police and the game regulators; and sharing the cramp apartment with the two young people. Rutland makes references to his two earlier movies; Charade and An Affair to Remember by singing the theme songs.1.
