Everything in weeds holds together. The magic in weeds comes from its ability to make the ridiculously unbelievable to ridiculously believable. It's been a long time since i've seen a TV show air with this level of quality in both script and production values. There is an all star cast from Mary-Louise parker to Liz Perkins and Kevin Nealon, which yields superb acting.The editing is also top notch. God, I love that introduction, genius. Just remember that soon you'll have this show stuck in your head. I know I do. ....little boxes, little boxes, made of ticky tacky little boxes....

In fact, I'm surprised there wasn't a lawsuit. BB goes on to show how the life ruins the protagonist and his entire family, while Weeds makes a joke of it.  It works for awhile, but as we get into seasons 4 and 5 and see Nancy simpering and smirking through ordering the deaths of multiple cops and hapless drug minions, being raped, etc. the humor is getting strained.

I figured the complete set wasn't priced to high, it came with the digital download, and a cool case this way they were all together and all on bluray. I have to admit I really like the box set itself the glowing case and the book that the discs come in is neat to it even has pics from episodes like its a real book. But with that being said here's the down side the book is made of cardboard and the slots don't seem to be big enough to get the discs out at least not without damaging them or the book.

1667726,AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B00ELKDD9U,JMM,"[35, 40]","If you don't own ""Weeds"" on blu-ray yet, then this will likely be your best and cheapest option (rather than buying the seasons individually).  But if you already own some or all of the seasons, you'll have to decide whether or not its worth it to upgrade to this set.  There are two advantages to owning this set: First, there are four new special features (including a cast roundtable) that are only available on this Complete Collection.  Second, the discs come inside ""glowing"" acrylic packaging that collectors may want to own.This show is a somewhat polarizing one: some people really love it, others really dislike it.  If you've never seen ""Weeds"", I'd suggest you sample it before purchasing this complete set.  If you have Netflix, the entire show is available there.  In my opinion, the show fluctuates in quality season to season - but at its best it makes for great television.**********OFFICIAL SYNOPSISWhen Nancy Botwin (Golden Globe-winner Mary-Louise Parker) faces both sudden widowhood and poverty, she's determined to do anything to keep her kids in suburbia, including taking on the job of neighborhood pot dealer. Subversive and hilarious, the complete series is as intoxicating as ever, with everyone's favorite pot-selling soccer mom and the rest of the Botwin clan dealing with the mafia, love affairs, the birth of an illegitimate child, and relocation after relocation. Watch as the Botwins' plans go up in smoke over the course of the series' eight unpredictable seasons.**********WEEDS: COMPLETE COLLECTION1. Includes all 8 Seasons (102 Episodes) of the Show2.
