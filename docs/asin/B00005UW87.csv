686362,A1FALNRP7TPE3V,B00005UW87,A. Lucy,"[2, 2]","Because this is a long movie and made for TV, what, ten years ago maybe? Some people might think of over-looking this particular fairytale; that, however, would be a mistake.I saw this movie around the time it came out on TV and shortly there-after got a VHS copy which I had for years before it was broken in a moving van (amazingly, though, the thing still played on the VCR in spite of having a giant crack running through it!) and then didn't see it again for a long time. I remembered liking it, though, and after re-finding my tape decided it was time to get me a dvd copy so when I saw this in a ""buy together"" deal with ""Snow White Fairest of them all"" I bought it. Trust me, this is a film that stands up to watching over and over.A brilliant modern day re-make of the classic fairytale, one thing this film offers is a fantasy that even though it's in fairly contemparay times, doesn't modernize every single detail (unlike the ""cinderella story"" films or ""Sidney White"", which are nice movies for their own merits, but lack any real plunge into a sci-fi/fantasy genre so often found in fairytales), thus leaving room for the full-blown fantasy aspects. The effects are good, and the storyline is gripping, the acting is on-spot and well-done, and the characters are interesting.The story centers around a decendant of the ""first Jack"" (the one who killed a giant and stole the goose laying golden eggs and the magic harp) who must right the wrong by finding the tresures again and amending the damage in a world that has only had a number of days pass in their time, not hundreds of years as in his. He discovers that his ""great aunt"" isn't dead and she tells the story we all know; then later, on trial in another world, he hears the story from the point of view of the dead giant's adopted human daughter, who explains that the giant was kind to everyone, including Jack who betrayed their family by stealing their goose and harp.Because of the interworld travel which is such a big theme in this film, I would strongly recomend this movie for fans of ""Narnia"" or ""The neverending story"" or the Tim Burton version of ""Alice in Wonderland"".Great fantasy movie! Really stands the test of time. DVD quailty isn't impressive, per-say, but it's definately watchable and the scenes in giant land are much more lush and colourful on dvd than vhs though there seems to be little change in quailty in the real-world scenes.As a final note, I'd just like to say that to those reviewers saying this movie isn't good because it's too busy paying back or ""moralizing"" an old fairytale instead of just taking it for what it is, have you ever READ the old fairytales? They're full of morals, sometimes in a rather rough way. Stepsisters getting their comupperance because birds pecked out their eyes? Evil brothers in ""The golden bird"" getting punished for trying to kill their brother and steal his gold and wife? Yeah. So if Henson wants to add a black and white moral to Jack in the beanstalk, I say let them; they don't pound you over the head with it, it's revealed slowly through the course of the story, so what's the big deal?Great movie!",5,One of the best re-imaginings of a fairytale currently on dvd,1314230400,"08 25, 2011",2011,3144,"['long', 'movie', 'made', 'TV', 'what', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'maybe', 'people', 'might', 'think', 'over-looking', 'particular', 'fairytale', 'however', 'would', 'be', 'mistake.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'TV', 'shortly', 'there-after', 'got', 'VHS', 'copy', 'had', 'years', 'was', 'broken', 'moving', 'van', 'amazingly', 'thing', 'still', 'played', 'VCR', 'spite', 'having', 'giant', 'crack', 'running', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'long', 'time', 'remembered', 'liking', 'though', 're-finding', 'tape', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'get', 'dvd', 'copy', 'when', 'saw', 'buy', 'together', 'deal', 'Snow', 'White', 'Fairest', 'bought', 'Trust', 'film', 'up', 'watching', 'over.A', 'brilliant', 'modern', 'day', 're-make', 'classic', 'fairytale', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'fantasy', 'even', 'fairly', 'contemparay', 'times', ""n't"", 'modernize', 'single', 'detail', 'cinderella', 'story', 'films', 'Sidney', 'White', 'are', 'nice', 'movies', 'own', 'merits', 'lack', 'real', 'plunge', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'genre', 'so', 'often', 'found', 'fairytales', 'thus', 'leaving', 'room', 'full-blown', 'fantasy', 'aspects', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'storyline', 'gripping', 'acting', 'on-spot', 'well-done', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting.The', 'story', 'centers', 'decendant', 'first', 'Jack', 'one', 'who', 'killed', 'giant', 'stole', 'goose', 'laying', 'golden', 'eggs', 'magic', 'harp', 'who', 'must', 'right', 'wrong', 'finding', 'tresures', 'again', 'amending', 'damage', 'world', 'only', 'had', 'number', 'days', 'pass', 'time', 'not', 'hundreds', 'years', 'great', 'aunt', ""n't"", 'dead', 'story', 'know', 'then', 'later', 'trial', 'world', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'dead', 'giant', 'adopted', 'human', 'daughter', 'who', 'giant', 'was', 'kind', 'everyone', 'including', 'Jack', 'who', 'betrayed', 'family', 'stealing', 'goose', 'harp.Because', 'interworld', 'travel', 'big', 'theme', 'film', 'would', 'strongly', 'recomend', 'movie', 'fans', 'Narnia', 'neverending', 'story', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'version', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', '.Great', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'Really', 'test', 'time', 'DVD', 'quailty', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'per-say', 'definately', 'watchable', 'scenes', 'giant', 'land', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'lush', 'colourful', 'dvd', 'vhs', 'there', 'be', 'little', 'change', 'quailty', 'real-world', 'scenes.As', 'final', 'note', ""'d"", 'just', 'like', 'say', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'movie', ""n't"", 'good', 'too', 'busy', 'paying', 'back', 'moralizing', 'old', 'fairytale', 'instead', 'just', 'taking', 'what', 'have', 'ever', 'READ', 'old', 'fairytales', ""'re"", 'full', 'morals', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'rough', 'way', 'Stepsisters', 'getting', 'comupperance', 'birds', 'pecked', 'out', 'eyes', 'Evil', 'brothers', 'golden', 'bird', 'getting', 'punished', 'trying', 'kill', 'brother', 'steal', 'gold', 'wife', 'Yeah', 'So', 'Henson', 'add', 'black', 'white', 'moral', 'Jack', 'beanstalk', 'say', 'let', 'do', ""n't"", 'pound', 'head', 'revealed', 'slowly', 'course', 'story', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'Great', 'movie']",N/A

Apparently the dual, and confusing, premises were that one is responsible for unknown events set in motion by ancestors of centuries before, and that some vague, puzzling removal of a magical economic boost (despite the golden eggs being in storage...) destroys the entire resources of a magical people.

686369,AH8D0C1INV3LR,B00005UW87,fraulein,"[4, 6]","This is an imaginative take on the Jack and the Beanstalk story. While it was apparently made for kids, the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested (I'm 19). Plus as a female, I appreciate the fact that it's one of the few stories where (possible spoiler) the damsel (who's in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women) rescues Prince Charming.  Well-acted, it features some great chemistry between Sara and Modine.But I still can't give it 5 stars.  Here's why (spoilers ahead):1. I'm no math person but why couldn't the writers be consistent with when Jack's dad died? One minute, they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when Jack was 14. Since Jack is 37, it shows that the writers can't do simple addition. Couldn't they just take two seconds to do the math?2. How the hell does Siggy know about goose and harp? I got the impression from Wilhemina that Jack's dad didn't believe the story of the original Jack. But apparently, Jack's dad told Siggy not to tell him about the family's dark secret until he was ready. I wish there was a more believable explanation for Siggy knowing a lot more than he should.3. If Siggy is smart enough to know the all the Robinson secrets, I think he should be able to catch on to the fact that Jack is in love with Ondine fairly quickly. I always wondered why he didn't try to kill Ondine when he was so against Jack having an heir.  I understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones. Don't get me wrong, I don't want Ondine to die.  I wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and Jack.  But shooting her (or at least threatening her) would have been a great way to kick up the tension/suspense.4. Siggy's accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy thatcompletely fell flat. It was not funny and was a bit gratuitous.But if you're a fan of romance, adventure, or just feel-good movies in general, those things shouldn't keep you from enjoying this film.

686371,AEX8QRVEFMKN8,B00005UW87,"Gloria Clothier ""Movie Crazy""","[12, 35]","&quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; was my favorite fairy tale when I was a child; and I had great hopes when I heard about this television adaptation that Hollywood would finally do it justice. They did not. The Abbott &amp; Costello take on the story (released in 1952) at least gives you a few good laughs. Why on earth has NO ONE tapped into the incredible cinematic potential which the earliest version of this story has??? I was fortunate enough, when young, to be exposed to retellings based on the earliest surviving text of this folk tale, which was published in 1807. For those who are interested in reading the original, it may be found in The Classic Fairy Tales, a scholarly work by Iona and Peter Opie (published by Oxford University Press). The vocabulary used in this earliest version is well above that of younger children, and it reads more like a novella, with its long flashback section. In it, Jack does not find himself in some fanciful cloud-kingdom in the sky when he reaches the top of the beanstalk; he finds himself in an arrid wasteland (presumably at the top of a cliff up which the beanstalk grew). He does not steal the treasures from the Giant for the fun of it (which would, of course, make him amoral); a fairy in the disguise of a beggar woman tells him that the cannibalistic ogre had gained the confidence of Jack's father, who was as rich as a prince, stabbed him to death, and then stolen all his treasures. His duty is to punish the Giant and avenge his father's death.  When Jack reaches the Giant's castle, he is admitted by a normal-sized woman who leads him past a dungeon, where the groans of future victims for the Giant's table are heard. The Giant does not come stomping in reciting a silly rhyme: &quot;Fee Fi Fo Fum, etc.&quot; -- but simply says in a grim fashion: &quot;Wife, I smell fresh meat.&quot; This sustains an atmosphere that is by no means light. Moreover, it is quite clear that the Giant could not be even 20 feet high -- let alone sixty. Given the size of his wife and the fact that no mention is made of abnormally sized furniture, etc., it seems reasonable to suppose that he would be 10 or perhaps 12 feet high. This makes him monstrous, without turning him into a cartoon-like figure such as one sees in Disney's (excellent) &quot;Mickey and the Beanstalk&quot; (1947). Jack steals a hen that lays golden eggs, and on the second and third trips up the stalk bags of money and an enchanted harp. Must we impose political correctness on a robust, traditional fairy tale??? Save political correctness for real issues: women's rights, racial equality, etc. I mean, really, this IS a fairy tale. The giant is a murderous man-eating monster who deserves death; he isn't some poor fellow with a pituitary gland problem! I can just imagine what a marvellous story might have been told with the budget wasted on this piece of tripe. And Vanessa Redgrave --what a delightfully sinister fairy she would have made! The beanstalk effects were very well executed; how great it would have been to see them incorporated into a story set entirely in the past (in the 9th century, in the reign of King Alfred, to be precise). In addition to the unneeded political correctness, there is too much comedy in this version; I mean, give me a break, the Giant in this version has (if I recall correctly) a chef with an Italian accent!!! I could go on and on, but I won't. If you want to see a good, old fashioned fantasy film, watch &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1958) or &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; (1962). Some of the effects may be creaky (particularly in the latter film), but at least they don't mangle the rich story-telling tradition that has existed since 750 B.C., when Homer wrote the Odyssey and first gave us an evil-flesh-eating monster in the form of the Cyclops. And, if you want to see an adult version of &quot;Snow-White,&quot; for example, watch &quot;Snow White: A Tale of Terror,&quot; with Sigourney Weaver. AVOID &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk - The Real Story&quot; like the plague unless you want to see Hollywood mangle a traditional story and serve it up as pabulum for people with no stomach for traditional stories, which are not going to warp a child's mind.

Not only is the story great for kids (but appropriately rated at PG because of a few scary scenes) , it is really wonderful for adults, too.The story has been changed from the traditional Jack and the Beanstalk.  The giant has been transformed into a good giant, and Jack has been transformed into a scoundrel.  The story shows a modern-day  good and ethical Jack, and what effects the life of his ancestor (the traditional Jack) have on his modern life.  Modern Jack didn't know that the traditional story was real, and that the traditinal Jack was really his ancestor, until some events happen in his life, and he finds out.  He also goes up to the giants' city in the clouds and ends up taking care of unresolved business.It has been several weeks since I watched this 3-hour DVD with my husband and my daughter, and I am still thinking about it.

You know he has a good heart deep down, but right at the start of the movie we see him refuse to invest further in a project that will end world hunger because ""poor people don't pay our bills"".  Indeed!  He is troubled by nightmares, then strange things begin happening.  At one of his castles, which is being converted into a casino (lots fo stereotypes in this movie but they work well), 2 workers have died, a giants bones have been dug up and the locals from the village are staging protests on a daily basis.  Then the mysterious Ondine comes pretending to be a reporter and stirs things up in him, he starts trying to find answers.He finds out that 390 years and 15 generations ago the very first Jack Robinson swapped his Mum's cow for some beans, went up the beanstalk and stole a golden harp and a goose that lays golden eggs. He rushed down the beanstalk and him and his Mum chopped it down while the giant was still up it, who then fell to his death.  That's his version anyway...This is a neat movie, lots of great animations from the Jim Henson workshop.  My son loved it, but I had to stay with him because he did find the giant a little scary and wanted to ask 1000 questions while we watched the movie.

The twist here is that it is the present day, and the Jack of the story is the latest in a long line of men, none of whom have lived past their 30th birthday.  What gives?  Jack finds out from a beautiful woman named Ondine who takes him to a land above the heavens.  It turns out Jack's ancestor, also named Jack, had traveled up to this land and stolen a magic goose from the giant, and taken it back down to earth.  Because of this, Jack, and all of his male ancestors were cursed to never live past their 30th birthday.  The modern day Jack, with some love and inspiration by Ondine, does the right thing and returns the goose.All in all this movie shows the visible hand of both Hallmark and the Jim Henson Company.

This film introduced me to the film acting of Matthew Modine and Mia Sara for the first time.  I liked the innocence and naivety of the character Matthew Modine portrayed in this film and Mia Sara was remarkably charming.  Matthew and Mia had great romantic chemistry on screen and the film had a smart plot from smart screenwriting.  Now my kids are mature enough to watch it so, I enjoyed watching it again recently with my kids.  It's a real joy to watch and the bad-Jack-character caused me to be introspective about my life.The story parallels the Christian doctrine of the first Adam brought sin and spiritual death into the world and the second Adam, Christ, brought spiritual redemption, salvation and restoration for the World.  And, in this film, we have the first Jack bringing death and destruction to the other world and the last Jack brings restoration to that other world.  The chanting crowds wanting the last Jack to be executed reminded me of some Easter passion plays I've attended.It's been a wile since this movie was shipping new on DVD so, the prices for new and used copies are too high, at the time I'm writing this review but, once the DVD is re-released again, the DVD prices for this film will become friendly once again.I was able to borrow a copy from my public library and I also saw it for free legally, on the Internet.

It adds to the fairy tale without making it come out as silly and stupid.The movie is about Jack Robison the heir and CEO of a large company. He is the one of a long line of men by that name who never survive past their 40th birthday.  It is up to Jack Robison to find out why then men in his families expire so quickly and how he can break this curse.  Believe me the results will surprise you.,5,Creativity at Its' Best!,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,636,"['watched', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'rapt', 'fascination', 'almost', 'hard', 'believe', 'movie', 'fairy', 'tale', 'could', 'have', 'high', 'level', 'drama', 'suspense', 'movie', 'did', 'film', 'fine', 'example', 'creativity', 'best', 'fairy', 'tale', 'making', 'come', 'out', 'silly', 'stupid.The', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Robison', 'heir', 'CEO', 'large', 'company', 'one', 'long', 'line', 'men', 'name', 'who', 'never', 'survive', '40th', 'birthday', 'Jack', 'Robison', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'then', 'men', 'families', 'expire', 'so', 'quickly', 'how', 'can', 'break', 'curse', 'Believe', 'results', 'will', 'surprise']",N/A

Be aware this is over 3 hours long, and it does drag a bit towards the end, but a brief intermission during the movie,will overcome this.  Get the DVD for the beautiful color, special effects, and 5.1 sound - they will amaze you! P.S.

I'm very surprised that this movie has not gotten more attention, there is a great cast and a very good plot line. They took the old story of Jack and the beanstalk but warped it into the modern scene and made the audience begin to wonder, 'did it really happen?' I'm 20, and I wasn't sure what age range this movie is for, based on the reviews found here people say 'oh it's not for kids' or 'oh it's a great family movie with high morals' Well this is my own take on it, yeah there is violence and a lot of romance and kissing, maybe not something you want to show your very young children. I think that 10 year olds will enjoy and understand this movie as well as older people. I loved this movie and the main star is soooo hot! The story is complex enough for adults, yet simple morals can be learned for kids watching this movie. If you like Tenth Kingdom, Snow Queen, or any other Hallmark production buy this movie!",5,"Magical, Brilliant, and Entertaining!",1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,1046,"['came', 'DVD', 'totally', 'chance', 'Amazon', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'out', 'viewing', 'first', ""'m"", 'very', 'surprised', 'movie', 'not', 'gotten', 'more', 'attention', 'great', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'plot', 'line', 'took', 'old', 'story', 'Jack', 'beanstalk', 'warped', 'modern', 'scene', 'made', 'audience', 'begin', 'wonder', ""'did"", 'really', 'happen', ""'m"", '20', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'age', 'range', 'movie', 'based', 'reviews', 'found', 'here', 'people', 'say', 'not', 'kids', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'high', 'morals', 'Well', 'own', 'take', 'yeah', 'violence', 'lot', 'romance', 'kissing', 'maybe', 'not', 'something', 'want', 'show', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'think', '10', 'year', 'olds', 'will', 'enjoy', 'understand', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'older', 'people', 'loved', 'movie', 'main', 'star', 'soooo', 'hot', 'story', 'complex', 'enough', 'adults', 'yet', 'simple', 'morals', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'kids', 'watching', 'movie', 'like', 'Tenth', 'Kingdom', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'other', 'Hallmark', 'production', 'buy', 'movie']",N/A
