974021,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000ELL1PS,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","I almost gave this movie four stars, despite the fact that it starts out stupid, moves quickly on to ridiculous, and eventually peaks at patently absurd.  Despite all the movie's faults and shortcomings, though, I'm sitting here having flashbacks to certain scenes flit through my brain and thinking ""that was pretty doggoned funny,"" especially some comments referring to Osama Bin Laden that I cannot quote here.  Now maybe you're sitting there thinking that there have to be some hot women in this movie, but I want to caution you not to get your hopes up on that account.  To my eyes, only one really stood out from the crowd (Diora Baird), but I don't really go for the showgirl type (Elizabeth Berkeley excepted, of course).  Nudity?  Nothing you haven't seen before, and not as much as you would expect from a film like this.  Somehow achieving raunchiness without profligate nudity, Bachelor Party Vegas really is all about the comedy - and friendship, or so the movie would have you believe.What you have here are four guys throwing their buddy the best bachelor party ever - which, according to the Bachelor Party rules, must take place in Vegas.  It's quite a diverse group of best buds.  First, there's the bachelor himself, Nathan (Jonathan Bennett), sort of your all-American type fellow.  Then you have Z-Bob (Kal Penn), the designated ethnic character of seemingly Middle Eastern or Asian descent, who is most intent on the weekend being an unqualified success.  From chubby parts unknown comes Johnny (Charlie Talbert), who just wants to have a good time - a goal that Ash (Donald Faison), an African-American, shares completely.  Then there's Eli (Aaron Himelstein), the mystery player.  It's never really clear why he is along for this ride - he's not family, he's younger and much more inexperienced than the others, and there's a good chance he actually takes a couple of nerd pills every morning.Anyway, the guys couldn't be more excited when they arrive in Vegas to begin their wild party weekend.  Despite a harrowing, rather disgusting ride into town, they think they've died and gone to heaven once they open the door to their penthouse room.  This feeling doesn't last long, though, as the whole weekend quickly falls completely apart in about every way imaginable.  Whenever they seem to escape from one mess, an even bigger one jumps out to drag them under.  They have to stick together if they are to make it through this incredible series of misfortunes that threaten to do much more than put an end to Nathan's wedding plans.Obviously, if you don't enjoy crude humor and general stupidity in your films, you'll definitely want to pass this one by.  I don't think anyone would ever call this a good movie.  However, it is pretty funny at times - and sometimes that's enough in and of itself.",3,A really dumb movie -- but it did make me laugh,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,2821,"['almost', 'gave', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'fact', 'out', 'stupid', 'moves', 'quickly', 'ridiculous', 'eventually', 'peaks', 'patently', 'absurd', 'movie', 'faults', 'shortcomings', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'here', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'certain', 'scenes', 'flit', 'brain', 'thinking', 'was', 'pretty', 'doggoned', 'funny', 'especially', 'comments', 'referring', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'can', 'not', 'quote', 'here', 'Now', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'there', 'thinking', 'have', 'be', 'hot', 'women', 'movie', 'want', 'caution', 'not', 'get', 'hopes', 'up', 'account', 'eyes', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'crowd', 'Diora', 'Baird', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'showgirl', 'type', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkeley', 'excepted', 'course', 'Nudity', 'Nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'Somehow', 'achieving', 'raunchiness', 'profligate', 'nudity', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'Vegas', 'really', 'comedy', 'friendship', 'so', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'have', 'here', 'are', 'four', 'guys', 'throwing', 'buddy', 'best', 'bachelor', 'party', 'ever', 'according', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'rules', 'must', 'take', 'place', 'Vegas', 'quite', 'diverse', 'group', 'best', 'buds', 'First', 'bachelor', 'Nathan', 'Jonathan', 'Bennett', 'sort', 'all-American', 'type', 'fellow', 'Then', 'have', 'Z-Bob', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'designated', 'ethnic', 'character', 'seemingly', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'Asian', 'descent', 'who', 'most', 'intent', 'weekend', 'being', 'unqualified', 'success', 'chubby', 'parts', 'unknown', 'Johnny', 'Charlie', 'Talbert', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'goal', 'Ash', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'African-American', 'shares', 'completely', 'Then', 'Eli', 'Aaron', 'Himelstein', 'mystery', 'player', 'never', 'really', 'clear', 'why', 'along', 'ride', 'not', 'family', 'younger', 'much', 'more', 'inexperienced', 'others', 'good', 'chance', 'actually', 'couple', 'nerd', 'pills', 'morning.Anyway', 'guys', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'excited', 'when', 'arrive', 'Vegas', 'begin', 'wild', 'party', 'weekend', 'harrowing', 'rather', 'disgusting', 'ride', 'town', 'think', ""'ve"", 'died', 'gone', 'heaven', 'once', 'open', 'door', 'penthouse', 'room', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'though', 'whole', 'weekend', 'quickly', 'completely', 'apart', 'about', 'way', 'imaginable', 'Whenever', 'seem', 'escape', 'one', 'mess', 'even', 'bigger', 'one', 'drag', 'have', 'stick', 'together', 'are', 'make', 'incredible', 'series', 'misfortunes', 'threaten', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'put', 'end', 'Nathan', 'wedding', 'plans.Obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'crude', 'humor', 'general', 'stupidity', 'films', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'pass', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'ever', 'call', 'good', 'movie', 'However', 'pretty', 'funny', 'times', 'enough']",Bachelor Party Vegas

974024,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B000ELL1PS,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","This is one of those films that I would've likely never heard of - save for a mention on a movie board discussion. Unfortunately, the same posting also spoiled the ending. So I went into this knowing that I couldn't enjoy it as much as I would have, had I experienced it fresh.Still, despite the spoiler, I had a pretty good time. The gross outrageousness you expect was there. Bizarre characters, wacky situations, implausible set-ups, sex, drugs (not enough in my opinion), and a crazed UFC fighter chasing the guys thru Las Vegas - all classic comedy gold being mined in 'Bachelor'. And any film with that word in its title *should* be like this.My only serious knock was the sometimes uneven acting of the lead, Jonathan Bennett, in the role of the single guy whose buddies are sending off to the static gray life of marriage. Because I knew how this ended, it seems that Bennett knew what was going on from the get-go; often standing off in the background, emotionally disconnected, almost 'studying' his friends. He wasn't nearly as engaged as his fellow actors in the grand adventure that they were experiencing. It's a distracted performance that, thankfully, improved as the production rolled along. And by the time of the cooked-spaghetti-wrestling-shotgun-firing-female-Elvis-impersonator scene, he's fully into his role.Predictable fare, but that's the point. I despise movies that are easy set-ups but fail to deliver. Don't you hate joke tellers who screw-up the punchline? Recently screened a movie very much in this vein, 'Accepted' with Justin Long. It was supposed to be what every wacky college movie is supposed to be - but wasn't. So I'm grateful that 'Bachelor' delivered what it advertised. Three stars for that alone, but its gimme gags and predictable set-ups are funny enough to warrant the rating.Big thumbs up (no pun intended) to Lester 'Rasta' Speight - the ""How could this get any worse?"" jail scene had me in tears from laughing so hard!

974026,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000ELL1PS,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 0]","Bachelor Party: Vegas. AKA Bachelor Party 3? No, it has no place being involved in the classic Tom Hank's film. This one started off decent, it had a few laughs and was looking like it might be a silent winner that has flown under the Radar in tradition of movies like The Hangover films. However, this one does not hold a candle to them. Even when you see that it tried to go for a bit of a known cast with Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar fame), Jonathan Bennett (nothing huge, but you might recognize him), Donald Faison (Scrubs), Daniel Stern (Home Alone), Vincent Pastore (same as Jonathan Bennett) & Chuck Liddell (UFC) with small cameo's by Jaimie Pressly and ... no, that's about it actually.The cast shows a promise that the movie could be something great, but unfortunately fails to deliver after the first quarter of the movie. It feels like a group of guys got together, threw some ideas for the beginning of the movie, and hoped to wing it through the rest, and it clearly shows they should have thought up more than just an adventure across Vegas on the run that screams out a clear and obvious ending that it seen coming miles away.The plot is a guy is having his bachelor party, they go to Vegas, and something goes wrong and they find themselves on the run as suspected criminals who robbed a Casino. They visit a porno set and end up being chased around town by the UFC guy, because he doesn't mind that his girlfriend is a porno star, but minds when any guy watches her on set. (Can you already guess what's going on and how this will all end?)The very end of the film blows it completely. A completely unfunny ending that is trying to be touching by revealing that it's all about friendship in the end. With a boring and eye rolling speech from Vincent Pastore, you think the ending couldn't get worse till Kal Penn does the worst thing he could do and break the 4th wall in the most stupidest one I have ever seen, proving the fact that Burt Reynolds is pretty much the only actor that can ever get away with breaking the 4th wall and make you smile, if not laugh when he does it. Oh well, back to another Harold & Kumar to mend the damage you did to your career with this one, aye, Penn?Overall, started off OK, but by the time they land in Vegas. The humor goes down the toilet and the most predictable plot I have ever seen plays out till it is finally given the bullet to the head in the end. I wouldn't recommend you buy this film, or pay for a rental... if it's on TV, somehow? Then check it out if you are curious to see it. But you will never want to see it ever again. Right about the time you see a scene on the plane as they are going to Vegas and watching a porno with an old lady next to them, you can see, the potential for big laughs is not going to present as the scene falls flat on it's face. It just gets worse from then on.All you have to do is check out IMDB, and notice that the film no longer comes under it's original title, and has changed to ""Vegas, Baby"".
